[Verse 1]
Turned a boy into a man in just one night
Now you wanna be my lover
Like you've never seen in color
Yeah, I get off when I see that you're in pain
Want that high top of the mountain
Dip it in the holy fountain

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want love unless it's mine
Now you want it all the time
Yeah, you want me all out your mind

[Chorus]
You don't want love unless it's mine
It don't feel right unless it's mine
Twenty-four hours on your mind
Now you want it all the time
You don't want love unless it's mine
It don't feel right unless it's mine
Twenty-four hours on your mind
Now you want it all the time
You don't want love unless it's

[Verse 2]
Look at you, looking up down on your knees
Treading in the sacred waters
Waiting 'til the high gets stronger
Yeah, yeah, I'll keep you begging, begging, ooh
I'm your fetish, ooh
Come and get it, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't want love unless it's mine
Now you want it all the time
Yeah, you want me all out your mind

[Chorus]
You don't want love unless it's mine
It don't feel right unless it's mine
Twenty-four hours on your mind
Now you want it all the time
You don't want love unless it's mine
It don't feel right unless it's mine
Twenty-four hours on your mind
Now you want it all the time
You don't want love unless it's mine

[Bridge]
I'll keep you begging, begging, ooh
I'm your fetish, ooh
Come and get it, ooh

[Chorus]
You don't want love unless it's mine
It don't feel right unless it's mine
Twenty-four hours on your mind
Now you want it all the time
You don't want love unless it's mine
It don't feel right unless it's mine
Twenty-four hours on your mind
Now you want it all the time
You don't want love unless it's mine
