[Verse 1: Clean Edit]
I'm waiting for the beat drop, we nod
In the faded out socks, never Reebok
I don't sleep much, up in the stu'
On the one and two's I got a verse for you
I got a verse for y'all, it's disastrous
Oh your favorite rapper? I'm smashing him
Stacking all the tracks with the backpack on
Who's this? Edit, let me blast this song
Because he rhymes so hard mother uffers want to find him
Never will I not be trying
All these other rappers lying
Look at the way I'm shining
Been up on the grind and I swore I'm climbing
Give me more tries I was born to dive in
Been around rap since a little lion
So let me pick it up then I started writing

[Verse 2: Clean Edit]
Hold up, where we at?
I was lost in eating snacks
Ate too much now need a nap
Goo goo gaa gaa baby rap and
Still scared to take out the trash
I still get grounded like Alcatraz
And now I'm cool? better doubt it man
But now I'm rapping like around these kids
I'm riding around in my town
Bass up so I'm acting real loud
What's up why you turning around
My stuff ain't as good as it sounds
Now hold up, hold up
Wait till we roll up
Planet of the h so great when we show up
Never gonna hate with the things that we throw up
I'm finna rise up so these lames better hold up

[Verse 3: Clean Edit]
Ima staple your mouth shut
Better tone down when I'm rapping around
I'm losing my mind like a psychopath
Your talking so much better take it back
For sake I'm a snake and I slither real slow
Ready for the mic, you and I, let's go
Never on the ces, UBI let's go
Godimes a beast and they both got flow
So, yo, I think I need to take a break
All these rappers talking (Shh)
But they got nothing good to say
They wanna hate but the hate is what I'm feeding off of
I know they do not believe so i'll be breathing underwater
