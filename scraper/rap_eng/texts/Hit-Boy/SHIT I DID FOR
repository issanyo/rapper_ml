SKIT MAU:

And that night I called her
She said she felt penitent being with me
I was pissed. I was enraged
So


Verse MAU:

I literally  dropped everything for you, from my best friend until the end I really wanted you
Confronted every problem that we had and always gave you a chance cause I wanted you
And the fact that I granted you that if you ever try to break up I won't let you
But our relationship was like a chewing gum, chewing you
So let me chew and chew take the flavor out of you
That how you do or how you did but I guess you miss that
But I ain't coming back nah not this time, but the last time I said that
Yes, I did came back
But this time I won't wait
Me and you just go hate
Gave you too many chances
Said fuck it but my plans change
When I look in your green light green eyes
Just makes me break down in cries back in time
When I was deep drowned in your lies with no life vest
And life vest was the only thing that could keep me high west
Now wait let me say this straight
Should I really illustrate
How much I loved you
And how much I really hate
Not being next you
Me without You
Is like toast without butter
And pen without ink
Can't go any way further
That how I feel
Not Seeing you in one day
Yeah it really kills
So i took trip down to the beach, so I could find my self again
Fell on my knees pray god that you change back to your self again
