[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
Yeah
I'm ridin'
Lowrider

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
How you walk in and be that fly?
Leave with pretty ladies in the coupe, by half-time
Playin' hard ball and The Impressions [?], my past time
First class beats from Hit-Boy, oh you stand-by?
I don't trust in that internet too much
Hit it long range, like a Jack blew up
So think twice 'fore you really step to us
It sound like y'all be sending threats to us
I be down with it when you catching up
Lately, y'all been making threats too much
Saying "Who got these?" and "Who got that?"
Who got the nicest cars paid all cash
Who had us blocked off when we made our path
Gave a bubble baths, start another stash
Y'all shall not fuck with Dom, he proper
3000 on the Cartier frames, watch him

[Refrain: Hit-Boy]
Don't got time to waste time
Gotta keep this thing off tight
Love will [?] on my line
She giving me a green light
Solid [?] I play with two Nikes
Doing 85 through green light
[?] and a sprite
Pass me OG and the light, ooh
Woah, woah, woah
I think she giving me the green light
Woah, woah, woah
I think she giving me the green light

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
How you walk in and be that lit?
Fly nigga, AWOL when I land on the atlas
Suite with the view at Caesar's Palace
Medium-well steak with the caesar's salad
Speaking down on my name, [?]
10 years in the game, yeah I lasted
1000$ fits on my leasure, one [?] flow, yeah I just read her
Hoes shaking like they having a seizure
Whole case of booze form in the freezer
Neck and my wrist on freezer
We here now, baby, don't try to freeze up
What's the thesis? Call me HB the ghetto genius
100% G shit, they can't fuck with the kid
Heart broke, go find another nigga that help you pick up the pieces

[2x Refrain: Hit-Boy]
Don't got time to waste time
Gotta keep this thing off tight
Love will [?] on my line
She giving me a green light
Solid [?] I play with two Nikes
Doing 85 through green light
[?] and a Sprite
Pass me OG and the light, ooh
Woah, woah, woah
I think she giving me the green light
Woah, woah, woah
I think she giving me the green light
