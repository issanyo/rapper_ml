[Verse 1: Hit Boy]
Half-a-mil
Maybe right before the liquor store closing
Bet the bottles won’t make it to the morning
I just need one to do yoga who sips 99 cent Arizona’s
17 when you ain’t taking no lost
Wish I can take back the arguments in the parking garage
Can’t even remember who started it all
I think it’s time to take a new approach
I would say I choose you the most but you do the most
Glasses in the hand let’s do another toast
I bought you that Gucci coat
Brought you into the studio
Phil Collins on 94.7 studio 3am
On the way to the loft
Car alarms going off thanks my exhaust
I’ve been working all day baby I’m exhausted
She said before you sleep you better fall in

[Chorus: Tyus]
We in the moment you ain’t never had a real one
Say when you with me say you feel something
4am in the morning and we still on
You ain’t never fuck with a with one
When you with me you know you feel something
4am in the morning and we still on

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
You know I fuck with you the most
Come get you in the ghost
When your dreams ain’t came true yet but they close
Tiger camo North Face trying to stay afloat
Couple deep pokes I’ll have her hitting notes
I love it when she moans for me
Pour that Patron for me
Splash it with that Veuve we going to only make big moves
That foreplay then woo I go Ravish Rick rules
How dare you didn’t give that pussy to me
Italian on Monday to start off my week
You make a nigga wanna put a lift on a Jeep
And pull up to your house all you hear is my beep
You the one I wanna split my steaks with
Then find you a impala off of Craigslist
Them other niggas ain’t even saying shit
This courtesy of the half a mil click
Got her on lock like a kill switch
It’s clear I’m the one she wanna deal with
So I'll take a ace and a 10
I caught her by her frame so I ate by tens

[Chorus: Tyus]
We in the moment you ain’t never had a real one
Say when you with me say you feel something
4am in the morning and we still on
You ain’t never fuck with a with one
When you with me you know you feel something
4am in the morning and we still on
