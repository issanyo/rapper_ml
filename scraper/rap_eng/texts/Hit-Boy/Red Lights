[Verse 1]
Mind’s driving fast, light years away
Like shining stars, just reaching space
And I don’t know if I’m awake
Mind’s driving fast, light years away

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I want, is to be home
Hit the gas, just be alone
Turn off the world
Dance with myself, like ballerinas

[Chorus]
There will be no red lights tonight, no oh
Not even will stars like yellow be shown
So quick that all that I see is in slow mo
Feel numb in my bones
Zen in the zone

[Verse 2]
Run all the stop signs, skidding roads
Explosive make the time go blow
And I don’t if I’m inching close
But I, run all the stop signs, skidding roads

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I want, is to be home
Hit the gas, just be alone
Turn oﬀ the world
Dance with myself, like ballerinas

[Chorus]
There will be no red lights tonight, no oh
Not even will stars like yellow be shown
So quick that all that i see is in slow mo
Feel numb in my bones
Zen in the zone

[Bridge]
Not complete until I find what I’m looking for
Home is where ever put the heart in
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

[Chorus/Outro]
There will be no red lights tonight, no oh
Not even will stars like yellow be shown
So quick that all that i see is in slow mo
Feel numb in my bones
Zen in the zone
There will be no red lights tonight, no oh
Not even will stars like yellow be shown
So quick that all that i see is in slow mo
Feel numb in my bones
Zen in the zone
