[Hook]
Anytime, anyplace you can get it right now
Right now, man down, man down
I ain't even gotta touch this, send my hitta's right now
Right now, man down, man down
I been trying to play it cool, but I'm feeling right now
Right now, man down, man down
Run upon him in his crib, crack his ceiling like bow
Like bow, man down, nigga, man down, nigga

[Verse 1]
Ask about that logo, I keep that toolie on my waste
Niggas know just how I go, you can't be snoozing where I stay
Catch a nigga broad day and just [?] with the K
Don't confuse me with the face, bitch I'm a fooly with the A
Yeah, he cut you now, but bet he won't shoot
Talking like you hard, little nigga, you'se a fluke
All that Hollywood shit'll get you on the news
Run up on your coupe, let that motherfucker loose
2nd straight shit, bitch, I do this for the tools
504 made, so I came here full
Hit em' with the [?] leave him slump by his boat
And she gon' tell it all so I let her have it too

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
B-b-bitch, you know what time it is
It it's funk put the punk to your mama ribs
Tie ya granny up like show me where them commas is
Bitch, I'm from the swamp where them gators and piranha's live
Squad full of troops, clutching [?] they can't wait to shoot
Said you wanted problems, now you got 'em ain't no way to truce
[?] ready when I make a move
Niggas know how we rock, nigga, don't end up in a box, nigga
[?] then a high spitter
10 shots from a twin glocc, boy you better hope that God with ya
All my homies go live, nigga, guns bigger than my pride, nigga
The streets know what the deal is
They want no problems with the squad nigga
I'm a hustler
