[Verse 1: Oktane]
Success is the greatest revenge for fake friends
That don't want to see you ballin' in a Benz
You ever bossed up? Then you know just what this is
I had to make the soundtrack for everytime we win
I make 'em say, this one for my side baby this for my coast
Almost everyone I know is doing dirt, dope or both
The temp on a hunnid, my team on a hunnid
The Inland Empire is the village and we run it
Look Malibu to Venice, 10 East to Coachella
Where the women get tan and the weed get better
Through R-I-A-L-T dot O, that's for sure
If that's too much baby call it the Toe, bounce
California nights with the top down
You need California nights with the top down
Say wassup, whole city know we hot now
Don't come around when we up if you was not down
Touchdown, J rolled pretty when I land
Other half on the rival don't play stupid I ain't playin'
Need the bass and the clap
Give me weed, give me dab
California, the home of the slap
Only

[Verse 2: Price]
Leftside, westside, best side that's where I be
Like B-I-G is to Bed-Stuy, bitch I am the king
Home of low-lows and scrapers
Eat at Carrie's or Bakers
D.A. pull out them papers
Watch killers turn into fakers
I still rock with the Lakers, 24 on my jersey
Where I'm from, niggas feel like they won when they see 30
They killed Hefty and his 9 years old son, these streets is dirty
Mama's cryin' and worryin'
Lord help 'em and hurry
These niggas is bendin' corners and thinkin' 'bout diplomas
California liquor store, drinkin' Arizona
Get the gas from the dope spot, papers from the smoke shop
Rock my Vans low top I bet I never go pop
Yeah, yeah bitch you know I'm Westside connected, yeah yeah
I'll get my life before you snatch my necklace
I'm born in Californ, IE I rep it every day
I don't listen to your music cause it's all the same
My words be pissing rappers off I feel like Charlamagne
Real nigga role call bet they don't call your name
909 and 951 we in the all of fame
You can catch me
