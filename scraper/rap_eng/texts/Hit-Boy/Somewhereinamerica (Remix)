[Verse 1]
Shoutout to old jewels and old school
All the L Cools and all the Slick Rules
EPMDs and all the Rakims
Every Snoop, Dre & Em that came before him
I'm an old soul, standing at the crossroads
Putting soul into my tapes like I'm Loso
Got more issues in my catalog than Rolling Stone
They'll outlast me and grow long after I am bones
Didn't grow up in the projects
But I knew niggas pushing weight like BowFlex
Uh, P90 next to the waffle maker
Half you niggas out there are some type of haters
Young and brown from around town
In my own circle is where I stay bound
All you trigger happy George Z's
I'll see you all later when it goes down
No justice for Trayvon, Marissa Alexander from her kids gone
Feds still lurking, Snowden getting murked, the government's putting work in
Living life without the long arm of the law
Police staring at ya boy whenever he's abroad
Pachuco gangster as civilian, no uniform
No pariah, a messiah with this ice, it's time to thaw
They tryna take my top off like take your pick
JFK or the Lincoln that he was shot in
It's time to wake up, not bake up
You getting shook up, so look up
You see the scales are tipping
So either get out or get up
I'm keeping it extra dirty
I'm outchea looking for Miss Curvy
Cuz if Mac got Ariana
I'm calling dibs on Jennette McCurdy
Gone
