[Intro: 24hrs]
24hrs, Hit-Boy
HS87, Private Club shit
I'm at the house of hits right now
Listen

[Chorus: 24hrs]
We always gon' fuck, we always gon' fight
I learned to say sorry, not always right
I hope you don't pick, pick up the hype
I hope that you know that you is my type
We always gon' fuck, we always gon' fight
I learned to say sorry, not always right
I learned to say sorry, not always right, yeah
Hope that you know that you are my type

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Skrrt, pick you up 'round 11:30
Van Nuys, damn, you said you was really ready
Pshh, I don't wanna argue this time
I don't wanna argue this time
'Ey, 20, I get it
Pshh, we not workin' out
All of the Louis, all the Chanel, pshh
All of the time, I guess it's gon' tell

[Chorus: 24hrs & Hit-Boy]
We always gon' fuck, we always gon' fight
I learned to say sorry, not always right
I hope you don't pick, pick up the hype
I hope that you know that you is my type (You is my type)

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
How did we get here again?
I keep it 1K on my end
This ain't the age to pretend
Arguments all in the back of your Benz
Look, we gotta talk this shit out
Like I'm watchin' my favorite show on the couch
I don't wanna see this be over
Put the phone down, come closer, yeah
Most of these niggas ain't valid
I just survive off my talent
They gon' buy you some lil palace
I'ma move you to the palace
Tell me what it's lookin' like, yeah
Barneys New York, we did it colossal
You don't even judge a nigga when I roll one and play gospel
You solid, I'm solid, let's slide off (Let's slide off)
We bonded 'cause both our pops locked up
Free the OGs in the beem
If you mak it two years straight, I'ma get the ring, yeah

[Chorus: 24hrs]
We always gon' fuck, we always gon' fight
I learned to say sorry, not always right
I hope you don't pick, pick up the hype
I hope that you know that you is my type
