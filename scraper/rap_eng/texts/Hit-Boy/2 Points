[Verse]
I don’t spend no major time with no minor people
If it’s for the greater good then I might deceive you
Living like a Rolling Stone but I’m quite a Beatle
Living by your own law can be quite illegal
You a sly little guy look me in my eye
You was only for yourself, never for the tribe
Wow, now he sayin’ that I left ‘em
I was always quiet when you said that we were best friends
You! You knew who I was from the jump
I throw a stone at ya nigga I’ma make it blunt but
You! You go hide your hand like a chump
True friends stab you in the front!
Boy tryna tweet on us
And why you wanna hate that is beyond us
I put my knickers on put my team on up
I just wanna PayPals like Elon Musk
Without a doubt, we winnin’ without a doubt
I ain’t shocked about the lies comin’ out his mouth
Yeah baby, you know they real shady
When they start apologizing for the shit that you forgot about
That was decades ago
You got a decade to go
You don’t respect me you know
El Jefe
De Chief-y
De Casa
De aaaayyyyeeee

[Chorus]
I want my other 2 points baby
I want my other 2 points man
That’s a 98 boy, where the other 2 points?
