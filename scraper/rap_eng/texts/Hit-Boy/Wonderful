[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, wonderful
Tell me what you want it for
Girl, you're wonderful
Nahhh, that other shit, I don't wanna know
Girl, wonderful
Girl I know you want one of those
Girl, wonderful
Here, Let me get you one of those

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Car pull up, bags pop out
Would you get in, and go all out?
Car pull up, bags pop out
Would you get in, would you get it?
Would you show me what that's about?

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
That shit's cray
The way she drop it low and then rotate
Slide down the pole, she bring it home
Yeah shawty got that long cake
It's my first day
I spend everyday like it's my birthday
Girl I take you down at the studio
Yeah, beat the pussy at my work place
I hit the home run at first base
I'm the type to win on my worst day
She the type to see a big rapper in a Benz
And then start to act thirsty
Ain't no competition they know that I'm a problem
You young and you the hottest you know she tryin' to holla
Put the tape out and shit starts poppin'
Tell her fuck me you know that I got it

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, wonderful
Tell me what you want it for
Girl, you're wonderful
Nahhh, that other shit, I don't wanna know
Girl, wonderful
Girl I know you want one of those
Girl, wonderful
Here, Let me get you one of those

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
I got an S I’m on my chest
Girl I’m gonna fuck you the best
If you not talking progress
I will not answer your texts
Would you get in, would you get it?
If she with it, she with it
I’ma take over the city
You can take over it with me
You know we pullin' up fresh, pullin' up fresh
Hop out them cars in a way that we ballin'
You know that we blessed
Girl we be the mob
It's some things you must know to respect
Live and we grow
I got money to blow, no damn regrets

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, wonderful
Tell me what you want it for
Girl, you're wonderful
Nahhh, that other shit, I don't wanna know
Girl, wonderful
Girl I know you want one of those
Girl, wonderful
Here, Let me get you one of those

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
And we ain't doin' nothin' wrong baby
Gon' let the song play
We ain't doin' nothin' wrong baby
Let's just gon' let the song play
Don't wanna say bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Girl gon' let the song play
Gon' let the song play, Gon' let the song play
Girl it's on
Girl it's on
Girl it's on
Girl it's on
All night long
Girl it's on

Girl it's on
It's on, oh yeah
Oh yeah
