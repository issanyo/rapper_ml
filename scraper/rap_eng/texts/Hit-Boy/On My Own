[Intro: Sterling Simms]
Did it on my own
I did it on my own

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Couldn't wait on you, gotta stand on my own two
Yeah, we just wasn't on the same beat, right way going down the wrong street
Uh, it gets real deep, ya dig, try to feel me
It is what it will be, say you been there, but it's still means
Nothing, where were you when a nigga had nothing?
Got kicked out of the crib, two at a time, sleeping on couches out of my mind
Uh, I got to get on the grind, pray God get on the line
I got nothing but time, but you could never take none of mine remember that

[Chorus: Sterling Simms]
Please, don't take it wrong when
I tell you that I'm alone yeah
Cause I appreciate the love, I appreciate the trouble
But it just wasn't enough, so I did it on my own
Did it on my own, I did it on my own, I did it on my own, I did it on my own

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Yeah, right on cue, came in the game no I owe you's
I'm the only one liable, say you ain't made it 'til they lie on you, what
Four am head down, long drive, little child
Gon' see his daddy on lock down, ain't really seen him much since he got out
Made me my own man
Look around, count about four friends
I asked for this
But don't need no help I ain't asked for shit, yeah

[Chorus: Sterling Simms]
Please, don't take it wrong when
I tell you that I'm alone yeah
Cause I appreciate the love, I appreciate the trouble
But it just wasn't enough, so I did it on my own
Did it on my own, I did it on my own, I did it on my own, I did it on my own

[Bridge: Sterling Simms]
My blood, my sweat, my tears
My days, my nights, my years
I did it all when they said that I couldn't
That's why I'm standing here telling you

[Chorus: Sterling Simms]
Please, don't take it wrong when
I tell you that I'm alone yeah
Cause I appreciate the love, I appreciate the trouble
But it just wasn't enough, so I did it on my own
Did it on my own, I did it on my own, I did it on my own, I did it on my own
