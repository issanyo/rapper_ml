[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Can't let 'em take your spirit
Never let 'em take your soul

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Sister don't let your guard down
You know there's more out there waiting for you
Hell naw, no, sister don't let your guard down
You've come way, way too far now

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla Sign]
Lesson learned, lesson learned
Lessons learned, lessons learned, lessons learned
May your future last long, past, present
Faith, love, hold on to heaven
One hand up, hold onto heaven
God bless us with every second on earth
Same as the legend was told
To my ears at five years old

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Sister don't let your guard down
You've got too much shit goin' on, yeah
But I know you've been workin' through all that
Know you, I know you've been goin' through it your whole life
And I say, brother don't let your guards down
Parties are starting right now
Know you've been workin' that body all night

[Bridge: Ty Dolla Sign]
But it's 3 am and we bout to go up again
It's 3 am and we're just starting again
It's 3 am and we're just starting again

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Sister, don't let your guard down
I know you've been working hard now
Brother, don't let your guard down
Nah, nah, nah

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla Sign]
And the fight not over, the fight just beginning
The lies get exposed, soon as you win it
The devil is smiling, the guy keeps on sinning
Don't let them take over the heart of them, no

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
Sister don't let your guard down
It's 'bout to get hard now
And brother, don't let your love go
Support her in the best way you know how

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla Sign]
Love on your woman, stand by your brother
Hold on to your loved ones, I know we've all lost some
Pray before rain falls, the devils are coming
They don't share the love but they're up to something

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I know it, I know that they're up to something
I know, I know it, that they're up to something

[Chorus: Ty Dolla Sign]
So, sister don't let your guard down
Shit's about to get hard now
Brother don't let them on now
Protect them the best way you know how

[Bridge: Kanye West (Ty Dolla Sign)]
The best way that you know, the best way that you know
The best way that you know how (Brother!)
Protect her the best way that you know
The best way that you know, he best way that you know how

[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
Sometimes when you have something, it's like you take it for granted. And sometimes something loves you and you don't love it back. See, right now, I wish you was here. I wish you was here so I could hold you down. I wish you was here so you could hold me down. This to my brother, this to my sister, this to my Queen!
