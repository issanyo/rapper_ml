[Intro]
I'm just wondering where you been
All of my life
Never ever think twice
About the feeling that feel when I feel for you, oh

[Hook]
Baby it's real, ah
And even if it ain't right
Let's do wrong baby
Do wrong baby
Do wrong baby
Do wrong baby
I wanna do wrong baby
Do wrong baby
Can we do wrong baby?
Wanna do wrong baby

[Verse]
Even if you got a man
I don't understand why he let you do these things you do all on the gram
Your excuse is that you're not ready for commitments
I know it's not that, it ain't your fault
You ain't never seen this pimping
Big pimping
Girl you see a nigga outchea winning
I can have you so wet so stop dripping
Iâ€™m just tryna get you out that denim
That's just how I'm feeling

[Hook]
You know, I know, we know
It's for sure
Baby it's real, ah
And even if it ain't right
Let's do wrong baby
Let's do wrong baby
Do wrong baby
Do wrong baby
I wanna do wrong baby
Do wrong baby
(I'll do you right)
Can we do wrong baby?
(I'll do you right)
Lemme do wrong baby
(I'll do you right)
Do wrong baby

[Bridge]
Yeah I'm just wondering where you been
I'm just wondering where you been
All of my life
Never ever think twice
I'm just wondering where you been
Wondering where you been
All-all of my life
I'll do you right

[Hook]
And even if it ain't right
Let's do wrong baby
Let's do wrong baby
Do wrong baby
Do-do wrong baby
I wanna do wrong baby
Do wrong baby
Can we do wrong baby?
Wanna do wrong baby
Do wrong baby
