[Verse 1: P]
Tryna get a couple rich white friends
Pull up on you in a coke white Benz
Now I’m stuntin hard just like them
Call me a sell out but I'm counting these skins
So fuck it
My ambition be the shit that they lovin'
I'm on one, don't approach me in public
I don't fuck with no suckas
'Bout bread, I don't love 'em or trust 'em
Lucrative, we can have a discussion
Boy, I hope you ain't bluffing
Now Hollywood
Fabio, I got a lotta hoes, lotta drugs
Man, I love to ease my mind with those
Now it’s, mo' money mo' problems
But I, I want 'em all
Tell me what it cost to solve ‘em
Tryna make a hit with Hit and
Get me one of them Grammy’s he got
Gotta get this cash
Even if a nigga gotta sign with Reebok
That old money like stocks and oil money
My cash don’t fold and my daughter, she spoiled money

[Hook: Hit-Boy & Kent Jamz]
The minute I put my team on
I’ma pull a mil' out the bank
And play this theme song
Welcome to the neighborhood
Nigga, where it’s all good
Say goodbye to the ghetto bird
Hi to the milkman and white friends

Rich white friends
Rich white
Rich white friends
Rich white

[Verse 2: Kent Jamz]
Ooh fuck the dollars, I need euro and yen
Rich white friends
Rich white friends
Rich white
White bitch, Humboldt State, send me 50k
About to graduate and work for the DEA
Sold her dad a million dollar idea
Got a lot of money, have a lot of nightmares
Screaming down Crescent Heights
No roof on her coupe
See the boys in the back with a blue-eyed jew
Fuck [?], fuck 12
Let’s get this money, break the rules
My white friends say nigga more than I do
Bought my momma white house right next to you
Bought my momma white house right next to you
I bought my momma white house right next to you
I bought my momma white house

[Hook: Hit-Boy, Kent Jamz]
The minute I put my team on
I’ma pull a mil' out the bank
And play this theme song
Welcome to the neighborhood
Nigga, where it’s all good
Say goodbye to the ghetto bird
Hi to the milkman and white friends

Rich white friends
Rich white
Rich white friends
Rich white

[Verse 3: Joon]
I went to Coachella with my rich white friends
Hit the K on accident, that’s the wrong white sniff
Oh well
I'm acting a hee-honk all week long
These niggas got more money in the bank
But they actin' just like me though
It's weed smoke in the air
I ain't even tryna hit it
My finger's keep twitching
Can't even text
Too much acid in my system
I love my white friends
They never act funny with me
But they get kicked out of their country club
If they make money with me
So I can’t bring too many niggas to they house
Playin' too much YG gon' get us all kicked out
And they ain't afraid to tell a nigga bounce
(Alright but you guys gotta go)
Tryna make it to that pedestal
You gone have to be fake a lil' bit
Or look back on life and regret a few decisions
But I’ma be wealthy as them one day
And they can sense it
So if I go over the limit every once in a while
But never get mentioned
When I'm with my white niggas

[Outro: Kent Jamz]
Got my hoodie on like Trayvon (don't care about the ghetto)
My pants down like Mike Brown (ghetto)
Remember Columbine (they don't care about the ghetto)
What happen if we organize (ghetto, ghetto)
Kids sing
Got my hoodie on like Trayvon (don't care about the ghetto)
My pants down like Mike Brown (Hand's up)
Remember Columbine (they don't care about the ghetto)
What happen if we organize (ghetto, ghetto)
Kids sing
I got some rich white friends
Rich white friends
Rich white friends (I'm making money with my)
Rich white friends
Ooh, fuck the dollars, I need euro and yen
Rich white friends (I'm hanging with my)
Rich white friends
And I still, keep it, ghetto, ghetto
Still, keep it, ghetto
All this Chanel and Dior
We still, keep it, ghetto, nigga
