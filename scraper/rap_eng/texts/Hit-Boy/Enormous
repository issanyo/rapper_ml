[Verse 1-Hit-Boy]
They say when you lose don’t lose the lesson
But it’s hard to live in peace when you’re used to stressin'
And I admit
Man, I’m still getting used to blessings
Because these kids in the struggle, that’s youth depression
I guess that’s how you’re supposed to feel when every moment is surreal
And every woman that you’re running to is unaware of your skill
Niggas try to hack you or bring you down like Shaquille
But you know you got that potent shit, you just hope it appeal
Young OG on the field, this is white glove rap
If white people feel that all blacks love rap
They who cut us the deals and the bad contracts
Stil we sign it, cause the cars out there, we wanna be riding
Fly and shit

[Hook- Travi$ Scott]
Toast a champagne with my real niggas
Screamin pain of your shame niggas
Van Gogh picture, ain’t it gorgeous?
Look at this life we built, ain’t it enormous?
Hold up, wasn't one of your niggas informant?
Dropping them name tags, hold up was he mormon?

[Verse 2]
Man, I’m high as fuck right now
I know my momma ain’t gonna like that, but she know my sacrifices
And I don’t have many vices, always gone just like I’m high
And hard to find like a satisfy, bet you my bday
Always got a new dress, but don’t like how much that she weight
Niggas wanna ride Benz, but they ain’t driving
Niggas be clubbin the LIV but still ain’t living
Yeah, I admit, I am a part of the problem
I go out and get paid, I go hard for the bitches when I used to stay home
Now these bitches in my section get their champagne on
Aye if you wanna get her better and not wait long
Cause she study with jady and Judy and the great stone
Ah fuck it nigga we on

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain’t lying, put that in a spect between my teeth and I’m sizing
But this bitch in the diamonds, designing
Like who life you aligning, spend the time and do criming
And no way why these bitch niggers chiming
Only can sort importance to gain aportion proportions
And hold a bunch of the corpses, the ugly wives or the gorgeous
We’re the victims, notorized only when it’s a victim
Justifying lies we’re coming to crime acceptum
It’s the sick niggers who only can wish better
And numb feelings, we love em through spent cheddar
My momma always told me don’t fall in love with material
But nothing matched the feeling of finding toys in your cereal
So here we go

[Hook]

[Outro x2]
Now we’re on our way to zero, zero, zeros
That’s countless for all our mommas
Money, music and marijuana
Now we’re on our way to zeros, zeros, zeros
That’s countless for all our mommas
Money, music and marijuana we own
