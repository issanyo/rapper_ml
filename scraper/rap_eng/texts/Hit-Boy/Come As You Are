[Verse 1: Oktane]
I go to sleep wide awake, and I wake up tired
You niggas go to sleep as rappers, and wake up fired
If this is the first thing you're hearing, dammit you're already late
This is perfect, I'll start with all things I hate, like this
I hate people that follow trends and wear the same fashion
I don't like people that hear wack music and say it's classic
I hate when people bring up Teach Me How To Jerk
Cause now my lyrics murk, and they just salty I'm amazing at it
Bring it back, it's time for me to address stress over these niggas
I'm having a hard time getting impressed over these niggas
I hate that you're gon' hear this and think that it's a negative song
When you should just change and prove my negatives wrong
Moving on...
I hate people that don't rep there hometown in fear of being lame
Yeah, I said it...
I hate people that don't rep there hometown in fear of being lame
Huh, the game done changed, cause it's like
So many people try to be Hov in fear of being Dame
That these new boys wings get clipse by the new young guns of the game
So don't criss cross my words nigga, you don't hear this from California
So I guess were just outcasts, can you smell the stank on ya
What the fuck is up, this niggas fucking nuts off of that indo
Not even a little, nigga this is the intro
And your problems are stronger than your legs and you can't run very far
So grab your sins and your friends, and come as you are

[Bridge]
Heavenly Father, please keep Satan far from my path
And keep these fake frauds and trifling broads away from my stash
They say when you give don't give to receive and give what you feel
So if I'm gonna give y'all anything, I'm gonna give y'all that real

[Verse 2: Price]
Now close your eyes, and picture this crib with no grass in the front
With a Ford Taurus in the driveway with no gas or with pumps
All the way to school momma asking if I'mma pass or gonna flunk
Cause I sit in class writing raps all day cause I got the passion to stunt
But I didn't need no class to pass 'cause I know the math
Used to rock my Pro Club inside out just to show the tag
Southern California where them light skin bitches know they bad
From the area where niggas love their mommas but don't know they dads
But momma raised me well, all by herself
Even though we used to bump heads, I be pissed off on that bunk bed
Slamming doors, talking slick, acting like I'm running shit
Party jumping on the weekend but I'm stuck on punishment
Get fed up and I move out, her pride high, she let me go
So work with H Team, my big homie, he help me grow
Told me get to the music, be careful who you trust
Two things you better not ever give that's up or a fuck, nigga, what
So I teamed up with Ok, seen the top we made the plot to take the spot
Like fucking not, we kicking doors and breaking locks
Deep lockdown, Pete got so many styles
Kissing bitches that look like Jada Pinkett
She gucci wow, wow, now
Since we made a jerkin' song, the world's erupted
Like why Hit-boy sign them?
They can't rap, it's all these discussions, ho you mean to tell me
Since we dance our music ain't bumpin?
'Cause please, let's not forget, 2Pac was on stage humpty humping
Back up dancing like 'when in fact he was good at singing that
Just to say your judgment ain't best, just shooting yap
I pray to Christ and wish my haters confusion
I.E. 909 forever lost in the music
Come as you are...

[Outro]
Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As a known enemy
Come as you are
