Ass (Hot)
The way you dance (Hot)
Girl your stance (Hot)
I got plans (I drop it)
Move that ass (Hot)
The way you dance (Hot)
Girl your stance (Hot)
I got plans (I drop it)

[Verse 1]
Pop it, pop it, girl you got it, got it
In this seat for like three weeks, girl I been watching, watching
You walk in with all your girls, all solid and thorough
You bouncin' left to right, you treat this club like it's your world
The truth, the truth, damn that ass's the truth
It's a couple things I'm a fan of, that's henney money, and you
And they doin' things, they doin' things that everybody can do
But them basic hoes, them basic hoes, that's anybody but you
Cause you one of a kind, you all them kinds in one
A lot of ten's a lot of nine's, but I'm tryin' to find the one
Cause paper-chasing you 'bout that, lane-livin', I doubt that
Clutch matching your outfit, them new heels that ain't out yet
They say that pretty dresses are worn to be taken off
So you wear that Vera Wang and make sure that no love is lost
And I know you see me watching, I admit it girl you caught me
Fuck a camera let me be your paparazzi, cause --

[Hook: James Fauntleroy
Girl, If you was a star
I would pull up to your show
Spend my last dollar, to be in the front row
Stand out in the line, in the rain or in the snow
I'd do anything, just to let you know
That I'm a fuckin' fan, I'm a fuckin' fan (girl)
I'm a fuckin' fan, I'm a fuckin' fan (god damn)
I'm a fuckin' fan, I'm a fuckin' fan (girl)
Girl I'm a fuckin' fan, you don't understand (god damn)
Cause the way you move that --

Ass (Hot)
The way you dance (Hot)

[Verse 2]
This shit got that feel (Touch it)
This shit got that feel (Touch it)
I swear I wanna feel
On that ass for real
You murderin' these bitches
You got the licence to kill
I'll be right there on the floor
If your name on the bill
Girl for you I'd go the farthest
Where you at is where my heart is
Racin' for your love baby just show me where the start is
No matter where the venue girl I'd support you regardless
You do it with no effort I swear that shit is so flawless
Don't worry 'bout them other girls I give them blank expressions
They lookin for my section, I'm lookin for affection
And they throwing me signals but they don't reach my direction
Bodyguard I'm your protection
Cause you harm that's out the question
I'm only here for you I'd pay admission for your presence
And staring at my watch I know this time is of the essence
Looking at your frame
You deserve the fame
I want it tatted, you should autograph your name, cause --

I'm a fuckin' fan, I'm a fuckin' fan (god damn)

Girl I'm a fuckin' fan, you don't understand (god damn)
Cause the way you move that --

I'm a fuckin' fan, I'm a fuckin' fan, girl, god damn

[Outro]
Yo, you right there on that pole
Take it down a little lower
Watch these dollars drop on that floor
