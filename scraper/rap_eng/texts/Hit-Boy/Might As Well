[Intro: Quentin Miller]
Yeah, uhh
Ha... Half-A-Mil
I get that pop beat shit, you know
When I'm around these niggas, cause this a real..
Yeah...

[Chorus: Quentin Miller & Dom Kennedy]
Might as well come over the night
Might as well throw that drink all night
Might as well do what you like
Live your life, yeah, live your life
Niggas can't take nothing from us
It ain't band, it ain't nothing to discuss
Is you hoppin' in or what?
Is you fallin' through or what?

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Or they mad now, check their blood
Held my position, I didn't budge
OPM for real, it's a flush
The real reason y'all keep breaking up
Got the whole game in my cut
Money only thing I wanna touch
Drinkin' rozay like it's crush
You might as well come over the night
Got my big chain on like I'm Puff
I know real OGs, try your luck
And he ain't fuckin' with the plug
Undefeated-Bape camp, it's all blowin' drugs, yeah

[Chorus: Quentin Miller & Hit-Boy]
Might as well come over the night
Might as well throw that drink all night
Might as well do what you like
Live your life, yeah, live your life
Niggas can't take nothing from us
It ain't band, it ain't nothing to discuss
Is you hoppin' in or what?
Is you fallin' through or what?

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Yeah, watch out with that, give you
[?], watch me, zip-packs, my 75
I got them [?]
Got them, kidnapped
Two girls, kiss candy
Tryna take a nice swim, let me hit the pool
Slide up, take the scenic route, yeah
And I'm driving reckless, it's all on Island Drive, ay, ay
They can't take my spirit, got to much drive, ay, ay
They still prayin' that I won't survive
HS87 still alive, yeah
I can't fuck with niggas cause they actors
Lit at 4AM, I ain't had to pop a caption
Gassin' your function like I'm Cam from the Crashes
Roll up 30 dutches and don't pass one
Run up all the bad ones, yeah

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Might as well come over the night
Might as well throw that drink all night
Might as well do what you like
Live your life, yeah, live your life
Niggas can't take nothing from us
It ain't band, it ain't nothing to discuss
Is you hoppin' in or what?
Is you fallin' through or what?

[Verse 3: Quentin Miller]
You been working all day, you need a brake
Might as well pull up to my place, yeah
I need some friends in your state, yeah
There's some friends, what you wait, wait?
Wait, I got some [?] on my head
Can't be letting anybody in
They don't wanna give me my respect
I'm numb to it, I don't even get upset
Bigger things, on to bigger things
Richer things, Puff & Biggie things
I got you in the morning, I got Listerine
Yada'mean? Know what I mean?
Yeah...
