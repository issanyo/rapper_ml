(intro)
Yeah yeah three
That hustlin' shit inside of me
Got to let it breath you know
Learned from the best

(hook)
That hustlin' shit inside of me
And as far as progress
You'll be high pressed
To find another rapper hot as me

(verse 1)
You sleep on me by default
It's not your fault
I heard some things that were false
Its' what ya taught
I hit the scene
And went off the radar
Turned down offers
Don't wanna talk
If they not
Breaking bread off top
Like christ at the center of the table
All my women is willin' n able
Grew up household stable
I'm unstable
Everything they said I can't do
Now i daze em
Not too far from where y'all said naw
New life brought in this world
Gave me new cause
Plane tickets for me and my dawgs
Im 1317, I put on for us all
Tech fleece on edgewood and everywhere else
You all welcome
Fuelbands they couldn't measure
The run
That the boy been on
I took my L's, I had enough
The bread I spend on my daughter be adding up
I value daycare too much
She bad as fuck, but she won't be looking for love
And that's real authentic shit inside of me

(hook)
And as far as progress
You'll be hard pressed
To find another rapper hot as me

(verse 2)
Living hard knocks serving bars
Living hard knocks serving bars to the stars
Life a size up from medium, living large
I'mma keep a  infinite in my garage
Flexing shit inside of me
As far as progress
You'll be high pressed
Everybody experts now
I get it,everybody critics
Everybody critics
Try not to take it personal
It's strictly business
I'm a legend either way so I'm not offended
Rap game been wrong
I stay in my lane
90's whip no tints on
You feel a way, you feel a way
Boy don't you lie to me
You'll be hard pressed to
Find another rapper hot as me
