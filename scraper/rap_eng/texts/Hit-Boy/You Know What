[Verse 1]
She follow me, calling me, all of me all on my dick dick dick dick
Counting my money and thinking that 'How did I get with this bitch?'
Maybe it’s cause I’m a general, rolling that swisher in all of my interviews
Maybe it’s cause of the clinco, the cocaína from me amigo
I’m reading the Bible and trying to get right but I steady keep thinking of ass
God forgive me I’m chasing that cash
The end of the road when you run out of gas
Your money thin, could probably fit it in a paperclip
Back overseas I know the nigga you was stationed with
He said you wouldn't squeeze a titty in a breast war
Smoking reefer leaves out of my bag and until my chest sore
Iceberg vest, I'm sniffing molly of a chess board
Your money coming next year, like the Beamer X4
Grant me the serenity to deal with haters
Do me a favor and never try to do me no favors
I’m getting major and my homie Uncle Blazer
Know I'm coke Razor Ramon, blow straight to the dome

[Hook]
(We tore up) Of molly and a pint of lean
Walkin’ to the party off in hella beans
(So pour up) That criss or the clicquot, 6 cellphones bought me 3 hoes
(So roll up) Some purp or that okey, the Kush God personally know me
(You know what) We wake up in the riches
And go to sleep fucking niggas bitches

[Verse 2]
It’s 2 girls at the same time, asses like the same size
They not from the same place but they both got the same job
They kick with The Clique, same whip its different paint jobs
And lord have mercy on them, amen, nigga praise God
I’m stumblin’ off the Benz, hella bent, thumbing through that check
Showed up with that oop, she in my hand, so what you expect
What I’m tryna speak cause real power is the people
In the chapel or cathedral, smoking packets of the lethal
And I’m fucking with them phones and it’s practically illegal
I been cracking credit cards fast as you can crack your window
Uh, I’m feel like I’m on the dose when I meditate
Put 2 arms up in this ho, it’s like the letter H
The crib got a couple of levels like the wedding cake
My old hoes tripping on me cause I’m in a better place
But I ain’t tripping, no, that petty shit reciprocal
The difference between niggas who be getting it and getting low

[Hook]
