We gonna take it to the moon, take it to the stars
How many people you know can take it this far?
I'm supercharged, we about to take this whole thing to Mars
Now we gonna take it to the moon, take it to the stars
We don't know what we could do to make it this far
So many scars, we about to take this whole thing to Mars

Lift off, lift off, takin' my coat off
Showing my tattoos, I'm such a show off, huh
