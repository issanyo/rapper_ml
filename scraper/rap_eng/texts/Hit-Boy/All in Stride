[Intro]
I'm so tired
How it sound though?
But I just can't lose my style

[Verse 1]
Ok, I'm back to school you niggas, this is open campus
This is pimpin', I should slap a nigga open-handed
High off life, I told a model she need lower standards
Asked her if she had a twin, I feel like Joey Tanner
Big spender, Kris Jenner, I promote the family
Car dashin', see the Benzo, she like, "Oh, it's happenin'"
Think she call me daddy cause she never knew her daddy
And my shooters all black, Rhythm Nation Janet
Boy don't make me jack son, robbery, uh, bodily harm
Was underground, now she toppin' me off, slob on my knob
Niggas frontin' like I ride with the mob
Why shouldn't I charge, me, myself, and I, ménage à trois
Play the odds, a yes-man is just a bobble-head doll
Holla them all, a nigga struttin' like Pac out the court
Hop out the Porsche
Shake that ass, got that pussy on menu, the à la carte
Boy I had to make my point bout this wave, watch for the sharks
Bounce

[Interlude]
Yo, hold the fuck up!
You dusty feet ass bitches runnin' here fucking these niggas for free worryin' about how your bills gon' get paid?
Bitch, if you knew better, you'll do better
And you niggas 'round here workin' another nigga bomb, and you ain't become no boss yet?
Get you some money!

[Verse 2]
Ok, I had to Chef it up, I'm talkin' Cuban Linx
Tell her ain't no weak link in my cuban link
Only like my cougars at a youthful age
Nigga, we was gangin' since the platinum Fubu days
I got dreams of being Hova, I should move in yay
Listen Bey', this shit so good you'll think I'm cool with Ye
Ok, my diamonds dancin', I could bag a LisaRaye
Life is hard, but it's easy bein' truthful, baby
This shit dope for real, overload the scales
This is pimpin' like I got coke in my pinky nail
Get the money, baby, we don't fuck what ain't ours
Bet it back, I bet I match it like the same style
Chopsticks for beef from shuttin' P.F. Chang's down
I gave you prophecy my first one and you lamed out
Luckily, sold dope, but it wasn't for me
Still the flow raw, peep the way I bubble in these streets
Who can fuck with me?

[Outro]
Nicky baby
(Dope, dope, dope)
