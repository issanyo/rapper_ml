[Verse 1]
This is for them women that love a talented nigga
She done had three career paths ever since I met her
One minute she a designer, the next she managing writers
A couple minutes after that she hit me talking 'bout she rhyming
But it's all good, boo you look good, look good
Wanna make a happy home but you can't cook good
Know them baller niggas don't care, care though
Long as you can throw it back in bed though, bed though
You got dreams of being a mama
And living somewhere in the hills right next to Madonna
And if I said you wasn't ill I'd probably be lying
That's why you drive them niggas crazy like mental asylums
I swear my life on the bible

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby it's whatever you want
If you got ambitions or
If you just trynna kick it
And lay on top of this
Million dollar nigga you chillin' with
Girl I want whatever you want
If you trynna to get it or
If you just want to roll up some weed
Whatever you want from me

[Verse 2]
And this is for them dealers that slang on the corner
Whether you coppin' J's with it or feeding your daughter
You gotta get paid so fuck what they say
Just make sure you cop a good lawyer
Cause I'd hate to see another black bastard
But you know they coming after you
And that ain't even the half of it
You got a son too so by all means
If it's a drought you show what your gun do
And if it get botched be two more black kids
Getting raised by there uncle
That's of course until he get tired
Cause he barely got a job so the system's fucking us all
So predictable, we got intentions to ball
But we can't pass the physical
Too much fucking stress to put your mental through
So I sip this wine and blast Aquemini
Praying to God that he keep me alive

[Hook x3]

Baby it's whatever you want
