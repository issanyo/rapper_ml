[Verse 1: Jude Demorest, Brittany O'Grady]
I take advantage when you say I can't have it
Say that it's damaged, take it for granted
Got an understanding
It's just between us
But they got eyes so I know that they've seen us
No they don't see trust, no they don't seek love
Look all they want but they not gonna reach us from

[Chrous: Ryan Destiny, Brittany O'Grady]
All the way up here
All the way up here
All the way up here
Look all they want but they not gonna reach us from
All the way up here
All the way up here
All the way up here
Oh

[Verse 2: Ryan Destiny, Jude Demorest]
Send my good wishes
Bathe in my riches, painting my fixtures
Painted all over me
Painted on all on my sheets
Cause it's just between us
But they got eyes so I know that they've seen us
No they don't see trust, no they don't seek love
They can look all they want but they not gonna reach us from
They can look all they want but they not gonna reach us from

[Chrous: Ryan Destiny, Brittany O'Grady]
All the way up here
All the way up here
All the way up here
Look all they want but they not gonna reach us from
All the way up here
All the way up here
All the way up here
Oh

[Bridge: Brittany O'Grady, Jude Demorest, Ryan Destiny]
Trying to practice what I'm preaching
Look at you and I'm in heaven, heaven
Oh my goodness, oh my gracious
They don't have the mouth to teach us
They don't have the
Oh they don't have the hands to reach us

[Chrous: Ryan Destiny]
All the way up here
All the way up here
All the way up here
Look all they want but they not gonna reach us from
All the way up here
All the way up here
All the way up here
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
