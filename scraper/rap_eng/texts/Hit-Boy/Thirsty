[Intro: Mariah Carey]
You know, you know you're thirsty
You thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty
Oh, you're thirsty (You know, you know you're thirsty
You thirsty)
Oh, you're thirsty

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
Chasing them bright lights, even change your name
Say you my boss now, ain't nothing out your range
Well, almost anything

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You used to be Mister all-about-we
Now you’re just thirsty for celebrity
Best thing that happened to your ass was me
Pull down them Tom Fords, and act like you see

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You thirsty for a dream leaving me drowning
Boy, there ain't no SOS
Filled with discontent
Finding you can’t quit
Why you try so damn hard?
Uhm, you thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty (You know, you know you're thirsty)
You thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty (You know, you know you're thirsty)
You thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
That Hollywood sign calling you again
So you stunting on your Instagram
But that shit ain't everything

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You used to be Mister-all-about-we
Now you’re just thirsty for celebrity
Best thing that happened to your ass was me
Pull down them Tom Fords, and act like you see

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You thirsty for a dream leaving me drowning
Boy, there ain't no SOS
Filled with discontent
Finding you can’t quit
Why you try so damn hard?
Uhm, you thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty (You know, you know you're thirsty)
You thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty (You know, you know you're thirsty)
You thirsty
Uhm, you thirsty

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
Boss now, you tryna be a boss now, thinking you a boss now
Boy, you just fuckin' thirsty
Boss now, you tryna be a boss now, thinking you a chief now
Boy, you just fuckin' thirsty

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
See your name in lights, and dream of fancy cars
Like superstars, you don’t know who you are
That VIP too far for you to see
Outside the club adding me constantly
Can’t get the real math, yeah yeah
Cause boy, you’re thirsty, yeah yeah
