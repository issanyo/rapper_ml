[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Yeah, bottled water for the table got the, drip
Go on, take a sip, sparkled for them, too
Yeah, we gon' get to it, one way, or another
OPM, HS87, came a long way, yeah

[Verse 1: Hitboy]
Bottled water for the table, got the drip like FIJI
Sergio Tacchini, making sure my haters see me
Let niggas watch the way you move it, they get greedy
Don't think cause I'm ducked off I won't get you knocked off
I could never lose it I'm fine tuning the movement
Rappers in the game worry bout what Hit doin
You ain't even peeped though let these niggas knock again I'm shootin through the peep hole then hit Roscoes on Pico
Sun rise on you busters Hitboy still bussin'
Half-a-mill in your section you should get accustomed
Living room couch checking out her flexibility
I can see us committed not now but eventually
Damn we got chemistry and you told me stories bout
How you don't trust niggas in the industry you got that quiet storm my d in for me real one
She get that cash and bring it in for me so I order
Bottled water for my table wasn't always able
Had that stolen cable watching Clark Gable
I've been hated on at Complex and Fader
And I still do my best to keep it playa
And it's okay
Bottled water for the table got the, drip
Crack it open take a, sip

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
I know you still listen for a reason
That other shit was weak but I don't want you back
Fucked up and lost a real one I can't be replaced
Can't even look me in my face coming straight no chase
I had put a certain one on they feet and she disrespected
Fuckin other niggas out here with no protection
They say I'm crazy cause my life is true
Don't give a fuck at least I'm doing what I like to do
Never need advice from you
Look, I'm cash only
You can't even cook no real macaroni
Talking bout' matrimony
That shit be funny to me
Ima let the top down it look sunny to me
Thank God for showing me what I've been wanting to see
By the time we hit tour split all the big doors and Dom with some cute ladies they bringing a few more I'll pour out the champaigne for you cause you dead
Don't ever fuck around and bite the hand that loves you
Now you stuck with all these other hoes in the gutta
I guess it's Perrier for the night cap
I'm just gone smarten up my ways and bounce right back
You ain't stoppin' nothin'

Buy the water for the table got the drip
Crack it open take a sip
