[Verse One: Wesly]
Wesly
Wesly

We be packin pistols
Speakin spoken riddles
Got bitches on our dick
That mean we gettin pussy
Finish on that pussy
Finish on these niggas
Man we killin niggas
We gettin on them niggas
Kill em with our words
Kill em with our shots
P-Stunna crew
Man we goin hard
This is thug life
This is money life
Wesly on this life
And you know I'll ride

[Verse Two: Prince Baller]
Prince Baller
PSM on the beat
Let's get it

Livin in the moment, livin, livin in the life
Shootin niggas in the head
No reply
Niggas think we play, niggas, niggas think we soft
Holdin guns to the head, withdrawn
Always one in the chamber
Always loaded niggas come prepared, I think steady
Wavin guns at niggas act like they wasn't ready
Shootin off at any niggas, at the ready

[Verse Three: Jernigan]
Stunna!

No slow flow, this ain't 1 Train
Get mo' do' when I spit dumb flame
Back to the lab again, three years later
You quacks on my ass, but I still win paper
Tied For First got pushed back once again
That's why we did this, so light the kush and grab a pen
Take some fuckin notes
This is fun, crackin jokes
Untouchable PS empire took over the game
Uncoachable, but approachable
Heaven is in our aim
Cause we wanna be at the top but we livin in hell
You'll never be fresh crops, man yo shit is stale
Now let me be honest
I've feared the day Clip makes it without me for the longest
But I gotta persevere
And I gotta face my fear

[Verse Four: Apollo]
The verses keep flowin like a drive by
So much syrup, people always stayin high-high
Little codeine, little Sprite, take a couple sips then you fly
Me and the crew be like sippin and trippin and dippin and rippin until all the hoes clothes be rippin
Now we steppin up to the plate
Ready to create
A whole new generation of rap mu-saic
That'll blow you out of space like Atlantic
Discover a whole new race and new planets
Thanks to the syrup your plants need replanting
So plan it again with a pad and a pen and a Mac-11, doo doo, dead

[Verse Five: Clip]
Lately niggas got me stressin
I'm awfully dismissive when they write, don't care about much but me, like I'm narcissistic
The radio got me feeling I'm without competition
Like when I'm done with school, I'll be at the top of the business
And I am not being ignorant
Just being honest
Cause when I spit some rhymes, I be leaving faces looking astonished
Like, "the lightskin can rap, now that's just the oddest thing
I've ever seen, he spittin like he got the chronic"
Don't judge a book by it's cover, cause I ain't really a novice
Cause you don't get what you see most of the time and that's a promise
When I started I was probably the farthest thing from flawless
But now I'm on that 1 Train, as if my first name was Thomas
As you can probably see, my modesty is burstin through my seams
Though it may seem I'm cocky, it ain't the same thing
As all my confidence, I'm confident in my ability
To stay on top of this, I'm obviously making sure that I can see
All of my problems in this
Cause this is all me, no Drake, 2 Chainz, or Big Sean for this
Hop off my D
You gon see, it's my time for this
Man I ain't got time for this
Who's the next MC, Guru show them what spot we in

[Verse Six: Golden Guru]
Apollo said these niggas dead
I'm bout to put them in a motherfucking chopped up bed
I'm bout to say
You're bout to hear what I got to say
What I fucking said
I'm bout to spray the fucking K
These niggas puffin on that hay
I'm bout to blow
I'm bout to blow
I'm ready to go
I'm switching flows
These niggas know
How I flow
With the golden fro
It stay so puffed up
These girls wanna suck nuts
They know what's up
I'm chilling in the fucking cut
I'm stuck
I'm stuck
I don't give a fuck and bout to double up on my styrofoam cups
Sippin on them Jolly Ranchers
Niggas know we fucking lanterns
Driving around in the foreign cars like Dave Snanzer
I don't know what I'm saying
I'm just spitting for the fun of this shit like Saiyan
Switching, bout to go 8 like Gohan
I'm goin hard
These niggas wanna know, I'm switching flows like go-hards

Whoa
Man shouts out to...I don't even know
