This my brother Kanye
This my cousin Big Sean
This my nigga Pusha T, Kid Cudi & D'Banj
Chillin wit my homie Common
Can't forget my nigga John
So go and get your girls if you want to have fun
Wit the entourage

[Verse 1: Cyhi The Prynce]
I got backstage passes for girls with the asses
Fuck being local, I make music for the masses
Pull up to the club, and we holding up the traffic
Just made a couple racks, I'm finna throw it up in Magic
DJ I can't hear myself, can you turn me up a tad bit
I'm in here with my niggas, pack a killa, and a bad bitch
White girls love me like I'm Brad Pitt
So tell Angelina come and jump on top of Brad dick
And you can bring your home girls, we be in our own world
We got our own section we got weed and patron girl
We been makin movies, this is just the sequel
We bout to do the prequel, we might turn this club to Regal
We ball so hard in Paris, this shit should be illegal
Like a needle I get under niggas' skin like mosquitos
We the G.O.O.D. music clique, better know as the Beatles
And since I like you guess I'll introduce you to my peoples

[Hook x8]
Wit the entourage (Come kick it)

[Verse 2: Cyhi The Prynce]
I'm with C-K-P, and T-I-G
And these gon' be my niggas 'til I D-I-E
I'm in the club looking for a P-Y-T
And if she ain't trying to cut I tell her B-Y-E
All my niggas is hustlers, all my niggas is paid
I don't fuck with no bustas, while I'm twistin this sage
All my money is green, all my bitches is beige
And shawty don't get mad at us if you see a chick on this stage
Call me Nicolas Cage I'll steal your girl in sixty seconds
Have her up here in my section, popping pussy getting naked
We them Ivy League niggas so please don't disrespect it
Cuz I still know some killers that'll leave you disconnected
Got some partners that's in college, somewhere gettin knowledge
Rich as hell getting that white cheese, we call it cottage
Got some friends from the burbs, got some homies from the projects
So pretty ladies let me introduce let me introduce you to my possie

(My nigga Cyhi, this shit crazy)

[Verse 3: Hit-Boy]
Coming live from the side where niggas rob to survive
Now it's bitches hoppin out like hi it's a surprise
Then they dip out in the a.m., like 25 after 5
That's the life of my whole team we just happy to be alive
We be in London, and Paris, hitting bitches you cherish
You callin her up she missin like Ferris
It really ain't fair, you niggas embarrassed
If you wanted her then I got her, Balenciaga make em go gaga
I got hits like I'm a Dodger, I just hit then duck and dodge her
I'm with Kanye, with Sean, pimping right after the show
I be Common and John, simply clocking the dough
I be with Cyhi and Pusha T, all the hoes wanna look at me
Getting paper like the books you read, bitch ass niggas can't fuck with me
And let's not even mention beats, you ain't talkin money don't mention me
If you want a hit you better have my fee, and thats 100 like a century
I'm living life for the days they tried to play me
Now my pockets fat and good, getting obese on the daily
