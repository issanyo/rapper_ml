[Verse 1]
This is heaven I swear, send the devil my prayers
Look hoe I’m showing my ass, that mean I’m never embarrassed 
Everything is bout business I feel like Erick and Parish
Quite bored with the games, back to checking you squares
This that murda murda, aye send my best wishes 
The games a dirty hoe, a well-dressed mistress
My blood cuz said I blew up am I set tripping 
Cause when you popping, bitches talk they even text different
Such a fresh prince, Will Smith and Wesson
I’m so fucking sharp, could stick some shit to tetanus
Okay the ice on chill but shit my life is Netflix
I came and took they spot when the argued who the best was
Okay it’s Nicky baby, I park the Benz on the curb
I ain’t have no excuses I had to make that shit work
Go head and drool on it baby, I been dripping since birth
‘Cause when shit ain’t that sunny I throw that shit in reverse
I’m gone!

[D.R.A.M. - Hook]
I just had to run it back
When I ran into the cash
Think you wanna run away
And go back to a sunny day

And I don’t want no cloudy skies 
When I look into your eyes
I see you feel the same
Let’s go back to a sunny day

[Verse 2]
Me and hit in this bitch
And my bitch got a bitch
I ain’t giving em shit, only dinner and dick 
Tatt my name on your arm
That mean you gave me your heart
This the flow of the gods
Here’s a verse from the psalms
Swimming in this paper, let’s make the world move
Expensive linen, switching women like girl groups
Don’t make me pull up on you, I did my curls too
Too many clown niggas, I let the world spoof
You, life is a motherfucker but daddy’s back
When I’m bucking get to ducking like Aflac
Man these hoes outta pocket but still can have the sack
Never indirect I’m at yo chest like the cabbage patch
King, no it ain’t a thing that we won’t do for love
Only in business I must remove the grudge
Talk bout what them do but they don’t do enough
Got you bleeding red for my green
I need a Gucci plug, HA!

[D.R.A.M. - Hook]
I just had to run it back
When I ran into the cash
Think you wanna run away
And go back to a sunny day

And I don’t want no cloudy skies 
When I look into your eyes
I see you feel the same
Let’s go back to a sunny day
