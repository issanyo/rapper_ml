[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
Niggas tryna convince themselves that Half-A-Mil ain't serious
That's cause y'all cheaper than a motherfucker

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Told her put your favourite panties on
Daddy gon' take you out
My temperatures going up but really I'm all smiles
They running out of gas, we just fill up
I wonder where the other MCs go
I mean Marshawn Lynch I'm in beast mode, yeah
Cuban link swinging on a speedboat
Yelling so long niggas I'm outchea way
I can spot an undercover freak from miles away
That's cause I've been going in since '98
So if she up and left me trust, I'll be straight
When she coming back that's a TBA
I'mma let the top down what's your ETA?
6 inch heels fuck it lead the way
And you know the pussy good if she don't advertise
All we do is strategize about how to enterprise
I truly epitomize a player that hit his stride
A salad skip the fries
I put her on the thug life and miss Mary J Blige
Even El DeBarge wrote a 16 bars
I think I'm recharged
You couldn't test me if you had a scan tron
With a number two pencil dawg I might vic you
If you come home late baby I'mma charge interest
Game face on she gon' never show interest
Till I stop fucking with her then she's yours

[Hook: Hit-Boy]
Drove this shit right into the ground
Let it go south I'm up the street from the house
Parked at the extra mile
Highway ain't gonna hold this this
And her soul this thick
Gave you some attention and you got addicted

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Don't let this shit go to your head
But I need you right here in my bed
Keep it a buck I still miss your pancakes
And these niggas still can't get no handshakes
Legends in the game know I got the golden touch
Niggas take advantage when they know too much
First to admit I got issues with trust
Closer a nigga to you the deeper the cut
You won't catch me slipping catch me in the cut
Band practice yeah I'm tryna run it up
Working on the graveyard shift
Pussy niggas still hating on the kid, (Half-A-Mil)
Great times, 8 dimes shay blonde keep the heat out
OG brought the 63 out
Who I'm taking home that's the grey area
Don't get out of character and I'll take care of ya

[Hook: Hit-Boy]
Drove this shit right into the ground
Let it go south I'm up the street from the house
Parked at the extra mile
Highway ain't gonna hold this this
And her soul this thick
Gave you some attention and you got addicted

[Outro: Hit-Boy +  Dom Kennedy]
Don't let this shit go to your head, dont
Don't let this shit go to your head, dont
Don't let this shit go to your head
Clear the space Half-A-Mil reserved both tables
Don't let this shit go to your head, dont
Don't let this shit go to your head, dont
Don't let this shit go to your head
Clear the space Half-A-Mil reserved both tables
