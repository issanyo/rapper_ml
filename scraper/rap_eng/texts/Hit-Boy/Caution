[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
I just spent a quarter million dollars on taxes
So catch up to my bracket, you ain’t shootin' of my basket
I’m the bright son, that is sure
All in the face, no Braxton, how many millions did I make this year
Four? That’s fantastic
And since she knows I got pesos I’m living the real life bang bros
That mean I’m in Emmit Smithin' these hoes and running to
I’m just 22, small problems, nothing to ‘em, no confusion
Me and my niggas cause havoc when we have mobbin' deep
I’m a prodigy, put you on ice like a hockey team
That’s my prophecy, you should follow me
I’m ain't talking that Twitter shit, I’m just talking the realer shit, Ted Bundy, that’s killer shit

[Hook]
Caution, caution, caution
Killing niggas after him
Caution, caution, caution
Big bossing, feeling fucking nausea
Caution, caution, caution
Killing niggas after him
Caution, caution, caution
Big bossing, feeling fucking nausea

[Verse 2: Price Tag]
Alright, I’m actually getting green, that’s the C-Lo dough
Rest in peace to Marley, Jermaine, Jakie and Tito, bro
Breaking all the penal codes, rather make it Peter Rose
She see me, she see that gold, my money off, now she go low
I’m getting paper, feeling like a player
You’re waiting on the world to change, boy, you John Mayer
Take a girl and slay her, sleep with both her friends, I’m going in
Real nigga came up out that gudda like a bowling pin
And here I go again
Talk shits or no talking, I’m like John Wild with this balling
Wizard, kill her, no name calling
Be the gummy water flossing, we are gators, no lacrossing
In that coffee you get toasting all this ball is so exhausting
So I’m screaming out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Oktane]
HS87 the hottest, that’s the word on the street
Boy we crappin out on these rappers like birds on the beach
Any haters kill em all, you ain’t with us, you suppose to die
You dummies couldn’t get division, so we multiplied
Oktane, that young nigga, that Jimmy Roll, that boy
And your girl is that model chick, that centerfold, my toy
I be playing playing be playing with her, when you leave I land with her
Double trouble I slay your sister and leave the scene, I ain’t staying with her
Twenty four around the clock, I’m on my job, nigga
Looking for the realest, meet the mob, nigga
Now you’re talking of bosses, all about winning, never no losses
Money just spinning flip summer salting, we stare when we try to stop him, oh yeah we call it

[Hook]
