[Hook: Turtle NoJoke]
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter for you ungrateful niggas
Fuck it and you bitches this my anthem
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter for you ungrateful niggas
Fuck it and you bitches this my anthem

[Verse 1: Turtle NoJoke]
I remember them cold ass winters
My mama kept on the stove just to heat up
My pops was never at home when we get up
But always seen him when I looked in the mirror
Young niggas we was peacin' up on hamburgers
But now we grown, we peacin' up on pounds and burners
Police pull us over, stash it in the trey
Don't nobody know shit, give 'em the wrong names
Young niggas, young hard headed pistol holders
They call him Coca-Cola, he didn't sell no soda
They call that Motorola just to put it orders
But then he got deported, she can't pay the mortgage
Damn

[Bridge: Turtle NoJoke]
Got these bitches switchin' on me
Niggas is phony
No wonder why I get so high
At the top it can get lonely
Now she wants the old me
No wonder why I get so high

[Hook: Turtle NoJoke]
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter for you ungrateful niggas
Fuck it and you bitches this my anthem
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter for you ungrateful niggas
Fuck it and you bitches this my anthem

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
I remember we was goin' through some issues
Landlord leavin' notices the rent due
That December was a cold one to get through, cold as igloo
A million things on my mental, screamin' (oh lord)
On a road trip to Colorado
Mama sent me on my way with ten dollars
In a back of a Sedan rental in the middle, stop to get gas
Look up front I seen my aunt stuffin' balloons in Cheeto bags
Time to man up! It's now or never
OG said don't fall into no pressure, just keep gettin' better
Visits to go see Big Hit, taught me special lessons
Now I'm the plug nigga I got the connect on blessings
I'm flexin' on all these

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
Bitches actin' new, niggas speakin' on me too
No wonder why I get so high
The judge fuckin' up my mood early in the court room
No wonder why I get so high

[Hook: Turtle NoJoke]
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter for you ungrateful niggas
Fuck it and you bitches this my anthem
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter
It's finna be a cold ass winter for you ungrateful niggas
Fuck it and you bitches this my anthem

[Verse 3: Turtle NoJoke]
I remember cartoons as a youngin
My mama sprayin' perfume just to cover
Police raided my room but found nothin'
I guess my step pops knew that they was coming
Cold winter so cold I'ma need a mink
Practice what you preach be careful who you greet
Don't let a pretty face distract you from these streets
Cause these bitches be middleman when it comes to beef
Real niggas where I live, boy, talk is cheep
Pistol on his cheek he ain't talked in weeks

[Outro: Turtle NoJoke]
And we gone ball all Summer, for all them cold ass winters
Yeah!
