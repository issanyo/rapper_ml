[Intro: D-WHY]
Can we all just get along? I wish we all could
Let's try to work it out, man I think we all should
I'm gettin' sick and tired of actin' all hood
Even thought it's all bad, you know it's still all good

[Verse 1: D-WHY]
They tell me ain't nothing free in life, but I'm living my life carefree
Stuntin' like someone triple-double-dog dared me
Duffle bags saying, "carry me"
Model chicks saying, "marry me"
Ain't got shit yet, but I promise in the future there will be:
One me, two chicks, three-ways, four-play
Five yachts, six planes, seven plaques, eight chains
Nine lives, ten times, I'mma kill the whole game
Accessories compliment, but the outfit is insulting
Riding in something mean, but I'm kissing on something nice
Sometimes I hate myself, but I'm loving life
Do you love your life?
If pain's the price of pretty, someone put me out my misery
Y'all making mistakes, I'm making history
I'll keep it on the humble, but see arrogance is more fun
Nice as your favorite rapper, just better looking and more young
Tell her slow down, give me less lip and more tongue
Ignore all the bullshit, that's how you'll get more done

[Hook: D-WHY]
See everybody talks, but I don't wanna listen
I'm just on vacation, they just out here trippin'
You've been here 60 seconds, I've been here for a minute
Thanks for your concern, but let me handle my business
Can we all just get along? I wish we all could
Let's try to work it out, man I think we all should
I'm getting sick and tired of trying to act all hood
Even thought it's all bad, you know it's still all good

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
D-WHY...H.B
I got bad bitches in tandems, watch me play on this piano
No, you niggas cannot stand him, but them hoes all think he's handsome
Hold her ass up like it's ransom, then she vanish if she's Spanish
Pretty women got it in for me, she look like she's from Italy
I just came from France, where French women just kissing me
You might not understand if your passport lookin' empty
I ain't got no sympathy, cooler than a winter breeze
Tell her, "sit down, shut up, baby girl just sip this Hennessy"
We never going back to broke again, we supposed to win
Told you from the opening, but you wasn't focused in
There go them hoes again, all over my trojan man
I ain't Troy, but these roman numerals keep on rolling in
We gettin' paper and we dress so player
Smoking purple, wearing gold, you would think I was a Laker
I am ballin' on these hoes, watch my turn around J'er
And I keep these bitches wet like Reggie Miller on the Pacers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: D-WHY]
Crazy, amazing, I'm racing, no pacing, I raise the bar
'Til I'm eighty-some with great grandbabies and 80 cars
Life's a McDonald's combo meal, baby we going large
And I think with my dick, so you know I'm going hard
I'm going off, but they tell me I'm on
And I'm feeling so right, but they tell me that I'm wrong
You know I'm with a red-haired hippie chick, no top, sandals on
Get up in it, handle business, finish, and I'm gone
Girls tell me I'm too hood, friends say I ain't hood enough
New girl says I'm too good, ex says I ain't good enough
I'll do all I can to embarrass you, then do some more shit
To ensure in 20 years, my sons stunt all over your kids
I.D. says I'm 22, think like I'm 35
Act like I'm 18, dress like I'm buried alive
Feel like I'm very alive, live like I'm ready to die
Devilish looks, I'm one hell of a guy

[Hook]
