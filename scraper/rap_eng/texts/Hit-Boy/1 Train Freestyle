Empire state of mind, but Wilmington's my colony
My niggas' bongs always be the cloudiest like Ptolemy
And I got philosophies doper than by Socrates
In the bed with models from developing democracies
Pretty nigga cold, but my skin hot chocolatey
Haters tryna body me, but them lames don't bother me
Honestly? Honestly? Can't take out the wild in me
And you know I'm tryna see money like the lottery
Moms is proud of me; I'm about to graduate
Game getting colder, all you niggas better acclimate
They say I'm Illuminati or I'm into sorcery
But I don't praise the devil, nigga; that nigga, he worship me
Orange juice spruced with Goose: Howard Hughes' plane
My dick up in her neck: one head, two brains
Two ropes, two rings, too trill, 2 Chainz
Nigga, anything better than that 2 train
