[Verse 1: T.I.]
(Go) Bricks stacked up in a high pile
G-4 flying, No Sky-miles
Get it, whip it, give it to whoever in the city
Hard, soft, girl, boy, decisions, decisions
All I can do is envision all this dough I been gettin'
And just to think back a quarter key was the mission
And now I'm weighing fish scale on a big scale
Hopin' I can evade the law and stay outta jail
My relative gave me work, I made it disappear
Like Harry Potter got that choppe in the window seal
My cousin wanna a brick
I tell him "Listen here you better bring my money back quick"
And he replied like this

[Hook: Yung Booke & T.I.]
Man, I can't even fit this money in a rubberband
Right hand get tied I just whip it wit my other hand
If I can't make that brick jump back, I bet my brother can
Off in my trap junkies bitin' like piranha man
And if they ask we got the whip game proper
If the brick game droppa
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter
Got the whip game proper
My clique aim choppers
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter, man

[Verse 2: Yung Booke]
(Flya) Straight drop, got Jays playing Sideline Telvin
Young boys got them racks in the sideline clutchin'
Cheese on ya head now you a fan of the packers
We be stiffer than a statue, We soprano style wackin'
Phone ringing, Its about to have a ticket calling
Get off of work, we all gone be Jordan and Pippin ballin'
Yeah, cause I'mma whip it til it lock
Set it out until you dry'em and distribute to the block
I'm motivated by big faces, I need guack
My only fear is God Almighty and snake cops
Some of my niggas hustlin' and some of 'em knocked
How many quit the game and the other was in the box FLYA

[Hook: Yung Booke & T.I.]
Man, I can't even fit this money in a rubberband
Right hand get tied I just whip it wit my other hand
If I can't make that brick jump back, I bet my brother can
Off in my trap junkies bitin' like piranha man
And if they ask we got the whip game proper
If the brick game droppa
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter
Got the whip game proper
My clique aim choppers
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter, man

[Bridge: Yung Booke]
And we just call it Harry Potter, man
And we just call it Harry Potter, man
And we just call it Harry Potter, man
And we just call it Harry Potter, man

[Verse 3: Spodee]
UGH! You try me you disappear, we call it Harry Potter
Just gotta ho, I tell her come sit on this Terry Carter
I get my bitches from the birds I'm from the swamp though
And I be fresh everyday, Bitch I'm young Spode
I mix the coke with the water like I'm chemist
I'm smoking until I'm finished
I'm focused and independent
You locals is my apprentice
Ugh, A lot of haters want my campaign to end
I fucked a nigga bitch and I champagned her friend
And I just acquired another a Phan, I'm truly swag
If yo boyfriend get wrong, I'mma shoot his ass
I'mma young boss playa, make a thick game holla
If this rap shit fall, I got my whip game proper, Spodee

[Hook: Yung Booke & T.I.]
Man, I can't even fit this money in a rubberband
Right hand get tied I just whip it wit my other hand
If I can't make that brick jump back, I bet my brother can
Off in my trap junkies bitin' like piranha man
And if they ask we got the whip game proper
If the brick game droppa
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter
Got the whip game proper
My clique aim choppers
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter, man

[Verse 4: Rich Kidd Shawty]
You gotta whip it with ya shoulda if you tryna get that rover
But that photo panamera probably be a lil' cooler, yeah
The trap hop, skip, jumpin'
Gas, no air, I got my ma fuckers pumpin'
Bricks, no rocks that's the ma fucking function
And if you try to rob I make ya head do the pumpkin
Finger licking delicious, check it homie got brickes
Sixes like Fannamy, y'all know what niggas thinkin'
I rock the leather coat like a ma fucking Italian
Dookie Gold Rope like the ma fucking medallion
Bird flappin' It's the home of the falcons
They got me in the middle of the trap like Malcolm
Whip transforming like the yellow camaro
Blockin' the skellos smokin the rellos

[Hook: Yung Booke & T.I.]
Man, I can't even fit this money in a rubberband
Right hand get tied I just whip it wit my other hand
If I can't make that brick jump back, I bet my brother can
Off in my trap junkies bitin' like piranha man
And if they ask we got the whip game proper
If the brick game droppa
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter
Got the whip game proper
My clique aim choppers
Make 'em disappear we just call it Harry Potter, man

Make you disappear like Harry Potter
