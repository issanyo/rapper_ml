[Verse 1]
I'm so, excited
I'm home, been grindin'
Let's go, tonight
Just make some money you know
I got it, if you want it
If you love it
I'm on it, I'm on it
So come on it
I need your loving tonight

[Pre hook]
I'm tired of my job
I'm tired of my boss
Im taking you out
You taking it off
Only thing on my mind is how we bout to get it on

[Hook]
I wanna get caught up in your love tonight
You can help me just breathe, breathe
Im tryin' get caught up in your love tonight
You can help me just breathe, breathe

[Verse 2]
Now we got time
Let's stay in
I'm sayin'
I'mma make her stay home from church
I'm prayin'
I finally got to take the night off
So we can make some love tax right offs
We'll light some candles with the lights off
So we can set the mood right off

[Hook]

So come on it
