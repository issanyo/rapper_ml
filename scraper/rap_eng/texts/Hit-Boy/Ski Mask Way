[Sample:]
- "Man, I can't believe this. They was gonna burn all this shit
All this shit, and a nigga can't even find a job."
- "Well, that's Uncle Sam for you, baby. Money to burn."

[Intro:]
I get mine the fast way!

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Ski mask way, yeah
These niggas finna know we serious
The custom made suede interiors
You see it driving by the superior, uh
King Parade veteran, home [?] games at the Colloseum
From the cradles to the mausoleums
Either it has be Bruins or the [?]
Stay humble, stay hungry, I was both of 'em
Rose gold, white gold Rollie, need both of 'em
All folks look at me and say "he knows somethin'"
Man, we got more comin', so... Let it spill
And you know I got a place we can chill
Nobody gon' hear your screams in a fear
Rocking at least 300 times in a year
[?] land at Heathrow in the morning, if it's clear
Little salt and peppa on the fish and chips
Boutiques in Germany, I'm the shit
Talking bout the top 20, I'm the list
I only talk facts, baby, get you some of that
Baby, born in '84, was a G by '86
No rapper formed against me shall prosper, y'all missed
Hit her with some birthday sex, it was a wish
If you see all the signs in the air, take the hint

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
If you was really small with the batch, you be takin' hit
Check my highlight reel, Half-A-Mil presents

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
No longer fuckin' with niggas, I can't even pretend
Came with shorts with the orange [?], no France
Family only in my circle, pages in my mental journal
Tell stories of a younging on his way
You won't walk in my shoes, but you'll know the pain
Heavy percentages I had to pay
Born in '87, kept it G since that day
I just get more solid every 21st of May
High stakes, you can't taste what we eatin'
Making beats, drinkin', champagne all fuckin' weekend
No tints, so they know it's me in it
Her pussy so good, I could go to sleep in it
Says she used to listen to Goldie every day
Not even knowin' that's HB on the flutes
Straight out the bottle, baby, we don't need [?]
Move how we want to, no we don't see [?]
And she make the suite feel like a Moulin Rouge
Moving at our own pace, we can't lose
Watching the flower bloom, that's how sweet flow is
Floatin', [?] turn them into roses
Pasadena on my mind, free Big Hit
When you touch down, I got it even more lit, nigga

[Outro:]
Half-A-Mil
I get mine the fast way!
I get mine the fast way!
I get mine the fast way!
