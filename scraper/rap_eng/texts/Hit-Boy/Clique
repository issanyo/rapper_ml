Ryan Scott-Clique

[Ryan Scott Verse One]

Give me that mic I'm feeling crispy tonight
Got the batman in the left hand beer in the right
Leave the speech for the best man my lyrical right
Is to jot down all my energy then turn it to light
Im that new kid like a new whip, got alotta people I'm cool with
Came in the game a jello fello, made it better with coo whip
Creative Rec, my kicks. New music, my shit
Im tryna grab my talent by the horns like Mike did
Pop off so knock off I give em' hell so Adolf
This shit for me's a cakewalk, Pamela on Baywatch
Imma tic tockin' time bomb, wrist watch my times on
Flip floppin' shines on, I'm hip hop's new white son
Im gone

CHORUS
I try to tell em' man, I try to tell em'
I try to tell em' everyday you ain't messin' with the kid
(Repeat 3X)

[Ryan Scott Verse 2]

See the problem with the game is
People rearranged it
Radio stations always playin' the same club shit
How do people love this, one and done artists
Comin' out with a whack single but it gets played regardless
These youtube sensations, young kids out bankin'
Parents taping kids the next day they're on Ellen
Im pissed off Im yellin', crusades rebellion
Type of flow to make heads spin
Im sippin' on my medicine
Crazy flow there he goes round and round a marry-go
I bait in all my flows then I hook em', Rufio
Cock back I'm Eastwood, so Western Mount Rushmore
I break down that front door Imma swat team, blunt force
Vodka attacking me feeling abnormal dystrophy
Poppin' shots like there listerine so my words can be crispy clean
I am sound fundamentally I could compete with Pistol Pete
These rappers are little league, Im Cabrera the Triple 3
Im gone
