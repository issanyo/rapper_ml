[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
I wish I paid more attention in school sometimes
But then again, I was thinking of beats and rhymes
Because of that, I just bought something clean for mom
And got my favorite girl giving me piece of mind
That mean brain, I always know my aim
But when you dream big, niggas say you insane
Ain't no way that you gonna make it happen
I know my beats is crazy but I really started rapping
Back in action, it continues, I'm eating what's on the menu
Any nigga wanna see me, come meet me up at the venue
Remember to bring your skrilla cause I don't do shit for free
And if you want a track, get ready to pay a fee
And if you want to act like syndicated TV
Old ass nigga, step aside for the new surf swag nigga
My shit iller, matter of fact my shit killer
Them niggas clones, I'm getting on for being realer

[Hook x2]
I'mma get mine 'til the world don't spin
Cruising down the block trying to clock my ends
Old school Caddy or a new school Benz
Old school Caddy or a new school Benz

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
I wish I paid less attention to girls sometimes
Cause I dunno if she riding for me or the shine
And I dunno if I'm wasting my quality time
But what I know is I'm addicted to bitches that's fly
Fine linen while I'm gripping this wood in my ride
Wine sipping while I'm chilling and feeling the vibe
Why niggas wanna act like it's all a mirage
Cause if I told you I'm the shit then I wouldn't be lying
Uh, young playa with a skip school swag
But by the time I turned 20 I was popping tags
I guess I did the right thing like Spike said
A pair of Js and a dream, trying to get ahead
Now I'm on a first class trip with a first class bitch
Getting brain in my seat, I call it air head
Big things looking small from the Lear jet
I'm waiting at the finish line, you ain't there yet

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Please, won't you tell me who did it
The illest motherfucker, your friendly neighborhood menace
Promise I'll be back, it's a fact
That niggas who think that they nice ain't gonna shine
Next to me cause my aura too bright
Do the fuckers sit on top, I'm knocking niggas off
No we won't knock it off
It's the price you pay to play hardball, wit' wizard niggas
Forced my hand, now I'd love to end these niggas
But my daughter got a father who is off his fucking rocker
Known around the globe as a stoner chief rocker
Rage ripper, honest little motherfucker
In the SLS stuntin like a motherfucker
I tell the moon don't fail me now
A nigga getting close to happy, I say
I tell my mom she raised a hell of a child
Four kids alone with no daddy
Real shit

[Hook x2]
