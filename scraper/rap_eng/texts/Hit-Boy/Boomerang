[Intro: Hit-Boy]
It's Sevyn in the plug, brrr

[Verse 1: Sevyn]
All these curves and all this face, getting all this work
And still you wanna go and act up
I've been up getting all this dough
Somethin' 'bout it don't add up, somethin' 'bout it don't add up
That's why you feel, how you let me go
And I'm so real, I be in the kitchen like your mama did that
Tatted on your body, shoulda never did that
Uh, woo! That's an autograph
Fuck another bitch is she gon' know that I was there
Uh, woo! 'Bout to pass out
Running up my pressure, 'bout to throw that ass out
Oh no, get off me
You've been doing shit like this for too often
I drew a line in the sand, and you crossed it
A need an explanation, tell me right now
Got me now I'm tryna tip-toe, turning locks low
So I won't know what time you got back in
In the morning when you want it
You be wondering why I got a attitude, what you think this is?
Oh no, no, no

[Chorus: Sevyn]
Boomerang
Love shoulda brought you home
Boomerang
But I ain't coming back no more
Boomerang
Love shoulda brought your ass home
Boomerang

[Verse 2: Sevyn]
Somethin' bout it don't add up
That's why you feel, how you let me go
And I'm so real, I be in the kitchen like your mama did that
Tatted in your body, shoulda never did that
Uh, woo! That's an autograph
Fuck another bitch if she gon' know that I was there
Uh, woo! Bout to pass out
Running up my pressure, `bout to throw that ass out
Oh no, you lost it, used to have it like that but you lost it
You must have bumped your head cause you lost it
A girl like me don't come around too often
They don't make 'em like me no more, make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more
Nigga they don't make 'em like me no more, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: Sevyn]
Boomerang
Love shoulda brought your ass home
Boomerang
But I ain't coming back no more
Boomerang
Love shoulda brought your ass home
Boomerang

[Outro: Hit-Boy (Sevyn)]
