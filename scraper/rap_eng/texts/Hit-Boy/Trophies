[Verse 1: King-D Tha Problem]
People say they want the old me
Funny thing there is no such thing as the old me
I just strive to keep it real and keep it OG
When you know that your the best
You don't say much you just stay lowkey
When I'm feeling pain, I swear that music is my morphine
We ball so hard and we are steady chasing more cream
You challenged us? Man I feel sorry for your poor team
And I guarantee if we not playing we got floor seats
Ha we got floor seats
Yeah and that's a promise I try not to be a liar
All the people that are hating just adding fuel to the fire
See at first I targeted the stars but now I aim higher
To shoot over heads like warning shots if they decide to try us
So like

[Chorus: King-D Tha Problem]
What's the use in hating on the crew
From what we've already done bruh we have nothing else to prove
Just let that be considered
I'm just tryna stay relevant and run ish with my killers
And yea they got some awards for that
Trophies. Trophies
And yea they got some awards for that
The things we do it come with trophies and some envelopes to open
Man we do this cause we supposed to yea

[Verse 2: King-D Tha Problem]
I work hard on my work ethic, stayed consistent to earn leverage
I graduated from the streets cause I worked hard since the first lesson
I stayed focus with an open mind to help me out with these blessing
& if somethin ain't pertain to music I cut it out like a c-section
And you know people said music made me fake
But oh well, chilling with yall niggies will not get me paid
So eff yall yea eff yall, all I need is my day ones
I been real since day one and ill be real when the days done
And that'll go till my days done till I'm six feet in a graveyard
Heads down, hoods up i'm yellin Rest in peace Trayvon
Music is my plan A no plan B so I'm screwed if this fall through
Just know I'm not just doing this for me, we doing this for y'all too so

[Chorus: King-D Tha Problem]

[Verse 1: King-D Tha Problem]
Fame, I swear to God that I'm after it
If you get in the way of that the outcome is disastrous
See I put time and effort in my craft & finally mastered it
Boy I wanna be a star and I ain't talking asterisk
So just know that I'm in this bit like a fetus
KGMG is the crew you cannot defeat us
I earned my stripes like adidas, tigers and zebras
Im living my dream so that means ya boy just walks around sleepless
I'm currently writing out all my Grammy speeches
If you're in the same category don't bother writing speeches
Yeah and if you did write a speech you was just wastin' time
Time is money so don't go around wasting mine
