Starvin' artist till I make a mil
Breaking deals stating that the tape I make is near
Haters build, I got you pissed like you break the seal
My rate is killed till I get poppin and I take appeal
I won't bail, man this studio is like a jail
Cuz I drop bars hoping that my writing's sell
These foods that I'm craving got me savoring the flavor
Of the fruits of my labor tasting ripe as hell
I might as well run the game, you cut the corners off
You play the role, I strike the pen to get my point across
I'm ahead of your tales like a coin toss
I spit it sick as gingivitis, I avoid floss-ing
I'm annoyed often and I'm over your high
I'm soy sauce salty and my hope is disguised
I'm finna cross lines like a DUI
But you suckas got no influence over my drive
But I swear I got my license suspended
I'm fighting the tension of writing the sentence
I try to envision a brighter incentive
Refining my writtens to life in this prison
I can put an end to your bars like death row
I took the spotter out of charge and he let go
So now I'm raising up the bar from my chest so
You suckas stop droppin pety bars tryna flex swole
But
My inspiration's taken by these college applications
And waiting for my place
