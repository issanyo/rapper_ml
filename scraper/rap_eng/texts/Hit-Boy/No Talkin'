[Intro]
(Who the Plug?) We the Plug
(Who the Plug?) We the Plug
(Who the Plug?) We the Plug
Nigga, HS87

[Hook: Rich Boy]
Can't you see I've been through shit? I don't wanna talk
I give a fuck bout what you speak about
I came with my crew bitch, we ain't gotta talk
We give a fuck 'bout what you speak about
Cause nigga, this that new shit, bring the speakers out
And I give a fuck 'bout what you speak about
Cause nigga, you don't do shit, you are not involved
I'm that nigga that you gotta call

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy & Rich Boy]
[Hit-Boy]
Used to just want in, now we want it all
That's my corner, aw that's my section, we gon pop it off
Me and all my niggas, they want us Black Robbed
But fuck it, I'm on my job

[Rich Boy]
A nigga used to pull up in that Lex like (whoa)
Tryna tell these niggas I was next like (whoa)
Next move be my best, finna flex like (whoa)
Break bread with my niggas and invest like (whoa)

[Hit-Boy]
Aight I'm bout to get it going
Bring em out, let's get it started
Turn Southern California, rep the coast and I put on for mine
Came up in the tow, made my first beat in the Meadowlands
12 years later, watched a motion picture telecast
Nigga major moves, major moves
I paid my dues, this summer we ain't finna say we finna make due
We the new take crew, that's we, that's us
A hundred million on my mind, giving zero fucks

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
I never switch
My beats be feeling like Kurt Angle in this bitch
Fuck a list, I got the angle better than it has ever been
Missed a couple Sundays in that C.O.G.I.C., this my testament
Change up the flow, yeah I change up the flow
I pitch change ups, I mastered at exchanging hoes
In a nation of clones, I'm that real nigga that stand out
Tryna outlast, nigga I done smoked my last ounce
Product of mid 90s, Daytonas and big bodies
I was in that SS, now that stand for show stopper
Similar to phone foes hoppin', bitch I got that bounce
Took my circle to the top, like a fucking button down

[Hook]

[Outro: PeeJ]
While you've been tryna get it and still ain't got it yet
Oh nigga, I've made more moves and not announcements
I said while you've been trying to get it and still ain't got it yet
I been making moves and not announcements
I had to think about it
I never talked about it
But you can think about it
Hey, I've always been about it
So you can think about it

[Hit-Boy] (Try to remake that ho]
