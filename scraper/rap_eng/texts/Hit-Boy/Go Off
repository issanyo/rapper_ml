[Hook: Chase N. Cashe]
I got a brand new jeep with the doors off
Smoking on a pound of weed, I had to doze off
And a bad bitch with me, with her clothes off
Balling like I'm K.D I had to go off
I had to go off, I had to go off
Balling like I'm K.D I had to go off
I had to go off, I had to go off
Close curtains on them boys, I had to show off
I got a brand new jeep with the doors off
Smoking on a pound of weed, I had to doze off
And a bad bitch with me, with her clothes off
Balling like I'm K.D I had to go off
I had to go off, I had to go off
Balling like I'm K.D I had to go off
I had to go off, I had to go off
Close curtains on them boys, I had to show off

[Verse 1: Quentin Miller]
Yeah, pull up in that '97, like it's '97
Third eye wide open, watching for the devil
Hit my daughter with a trip to Carter's 'fore I left her
Make sure when she go to daycare, she gonna look the freshest
Eating dinner with my niggas, feeling real boss
Shout out Complex Magazine, for that extra salt
Shout out 1317, I rep it 'til I'm gone
I had to go off, I had to go off
I found out I really am a star
In my own way, we ain't listening to y'all
We gonna run it up at any cost
Nah, nah, we ain't finna starve

[Interlude]
And now, now we back on this motherfucker live and direct
You know what I'm saying?
So, so, ladies, can I, can I ask you a question?
Baby is your pussy wet right now?
I just need all of y'all to scream for me
Come on, make some noise baby, yeah
Aye my nigga Da$h in the building, say what up
Yeah

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Last couple summer's it was soo hard
Cut the curtain on these niggas, cut the show off
Fighting off these Xannies, I don't wanna doze off
But I pop four school buses, oh my, oh Lord
Used to eat that free lunch, but it's not no more
We was whilin' outside, yeah, we had no hope
You an angel in disguise with no halo
Only thing I despise on that Jay Mo
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah, back in, back when, back time I guess
I get sin, sin, sin, sin, sin, sin, sin, sin
We went up top, not again, navigate
Intimate, Hennessy, on and on, let your ho flow when I hit a win
Come, come again, coming back again
One more time for that nigga you gonna die-uh
H-Town waterfall, that's in that whip right there
Hit my lights and I leave, cut the monologue
Have to close the curtain, cut the show off
Popping Xans, that bitch try not to doze off
Riding through the hood with the doors off
Seen so many strip clubs, damn I might invest
Damn, wait they got me for another check
Order up the lobster with the crab cake
I'm bad at holidays, you know I'm mad late
