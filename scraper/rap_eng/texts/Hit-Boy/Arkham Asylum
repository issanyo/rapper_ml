[Intro: Quentin Miller]
Huhuh..
Yeah... ayy
Shit crazy.. shit crazy..
Yuh, ayy

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Shit crazy, gettin' crazy
Shit is crazy, I'm here for it
Get this shit up out the way
I got things planned, Murakami jacket, ayy
Where we gettin' in?
H.B. got me in L.A when the plane lands
Baby, show me somethin' I ain't never seen
Don't just give me anything, give me everything
Don't just give me anything, give me everything
Give me everything, yeah

[Verse 1: Quentin Miller]
Straight from the basement (crazy)
Now my next sketched in the payment (crazy)
Sex when I want it (crazy), paid on the daily (crazy)
Yeah, link with my people (crazy)
Shots of tequila (crazy), text from a female (crazy)
Probably got a check in the mail, I don't check mail
Yeah, kill 'em every time, works every time
Yeah, first every time, I ain't gotta try
Yeah, 10/10 ties till the day I die
Yeah, I ain't finna lie

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Shit crazy, gettin' crazy
Shit is crazy, I'm here for it
Get this shit up out the way
I got things planned, Murakami jacket, ayy
Where we gettin' in?
H.B. got me in L.A when the plane lands
Baby, show me somethin' I ain't never seen
Don't just give me anything, give me everything
Don't just give me anything, give me everything
Give me everything, yeah

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Hands in the sky, give me everything
(everything, everything, give me everything)
'1da on the beat like I'm from the six
87 bpm, you know that's my shit
We don't make announcements, that's how you get ousted
Tap in with Q.M., my nigga, what the route is?
Gambino flow, I Glover like I'm childish
All this merchandise like I just hit a house lick
Front row nigga, I don't chase clout though
If I fuck with you, it's life what I stay down for
'Cause it be yo own dogs tryna play [?]
Got a hood bitch even niggas can't out smoke
Real shit, she just let me touch on the couch
Hunnids lay down on the bed, hard time keepin' count
UTD with me, they bustin' out the roof
Half-A-Mil squad, click, TRU

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Shit crazy, gettin' crazy
Shit is crazy, I'm here for it
Get this shit up out the way
I got things planned, Murakami jacket, ayy
Where we gettin' in?
H.B. got me in L.A when the plane lands
Baby, show me somethin' I ain't never seen
Don't just give me anything, give me everything
Don't just give me anything, give me everything
Give me everything, yeah

[Outro: Quentin Miller]
Crazy..
Crazy...
Crazy....
