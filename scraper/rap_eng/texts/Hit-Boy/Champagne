[Chorus: 24Hrs &  Madeintyo ]
You gon' call me when I land right? (Yeah yeah yeah)
Can’t remember nothin' from last night (Yeah yeah yeah)
It's automatic money gotta have it
Oh a little champagne gotta have it
You gon’ call me when I land right? (Yeah yeah yeah)
Can't remember nothin' from last night (Yeah yeah yeah)
It's automatic money gotta have it
Oh a little champagne gotta have it  (Ouu ouu ouu skrrt)
Oh a little champagne

[Verse 1: Madeintyo]
Ouu ouu, yeah, Gucci slippers (Skrt)
I'm that nigga
Yes I tip her (Ouu)
Please don't kiss her
Get in that top in my Don Cs
All of these bitches up on me
She said she met me at Onyx
You probably gonna have to remind me
Not hating; I'm tryna be honest (Skrt)
Blue faces I keep it one hunnit
She make you cry with that onion (Ouu)
Turning nothing to something
Shout out bad boys uh
Look like a pumpkin
Yellow bad bih uh, eat her like Funyuns
Uh, when you do your damn thing pull her hair straight
Section with the champagne
With your main thang (Ouu)

[Chorus: 24Hrs &  Madeintyo ]
You gon' call me when I land right? (Yeah yeah yeah)
Can’t remember nothin’ from last night (Yeah yeah yeah)
It's automatic money gotta have it
Oh a little champagne gotta have it
You gon’ call me when I land right? (Ouu ouu ouu)
Can't remember nothin' from last night (Yeah yeah yeah)
It's automatic money gotta have it
Oh a little champagne gotta have it
Oh a little champagne

[Verse 2: 24Hrs &  Madeintyo ]
See we balling, all my niggas flexing
100 turning up the section (Skrt)
All this money know that I don’t care (Ouu ouu)
All these diamonds on me it ain't fair
Black Wraith, we on double dates (Skrt skrt skrt)
Hunnit fifty sixty lost my count (Racks racks)
Back in Legend, pick up large amounts
Champagne diet, standing on the couch


[Chorus: 24Hrs &  Madeintyo ]
You gon' call me when I land right? (Yeah yeah yeah)(Ouu ouu ouu)
Can't remember nothin' from last night (Yeah yeah yeah)
It's automatic money gotta have it (Skrt)
Oh a little champagne gotta have it
You gon' call me when I land right? (Yeah yeah yeah)(Ouu ouu ouu)
Can't remember nothin' from last night (Yeah yeah yeah)
It's automatic money gotta have it
Oh a little champagne gotta have it
Oh a little champagne
