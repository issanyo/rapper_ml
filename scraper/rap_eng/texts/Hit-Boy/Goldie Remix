[STaTiiX: Verse 1]

I said it must BEEEEE cuz a rapper got flows
Any bastard talking smack, I'm smashing in his nose
Known for slashing throats and throwing hoes in open caskets
Think you rolling past me? I'll make your ass blow a gasket
All my brothers grim, come chill within the blunt smoke
I'm crashing your tower and rescuing Rapunzel
I'm unbearable and spit like a smoking Glock
King Midas Flow, I got this shit on Goldilock
Always been a cheater in this game of life
I'll take your dice and snatch your spinner if the stakes are high
No matter, my flow patterns are so dapper
Shitting on you, no crapper, roast rappers
With a bunsen burner, I stunt your learning, these cunts
Get murdered, I'm the top dog, you a munchkin furter
Crunching vertebrates, got that Gotti swag
I ain't talking Murder Inc, but more like body-bagging
And toe-tagging these rappers, I'm the damn antagonist
I stand ravenous, dismantle all challengers
I'm the catalyst causing these cataclysms
Doing damage with writtens when I smash your swagger to bits
I'm so fly when it comes to penmanship
I'll hit the nuggets till I kick the bucket, took your bitch
Pulled out her breasts and fucked em, then she nibbled on my chicken strip
Fry you little bitches, no Kentucky

[ASAP Rocky: Hook]

I said it must be, cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[STaTiiX: Verse 2]

I'm all about them golden (bars), homie I'm a rover (mars)
Don't rock loafers, don't got chauffeurs, but I'll leave ya jaw
On the floor and rip your throat apart, I go for hearts
I need a replacement, mine is frozen, X-ray it
You can see a fucking glacier, I'm x-rated
In the way I lay these bars, (Winning) kill and ravage
Leaving beats in turmoil, I see you haters tryna strong-arm
This is gym class, you need some shoulder curls
All my bitches been bad, your chicks are like the Golden Girls
I'll leave your block full of craters, Armstrong
Balling on that wizard shit, no Harlem
Pardon my wording, flow sharper than "Gilette"
And the sound so Sterling ... No Archer
But I'll smoke the dutches till I'm laying in a coffin
Hotboxing the sarcophagus, making the dead all walk again
So gimme opulence or take this cock in your esophagus
I stay up on that green, call me an herbivore
These dirty whores get canceled, Jersey Shore
We gon' have a situation if you're hating
Leave you kissing the pavement, or taking fists to the face, bitch
Erasing all these number 2's, cuz I'm the shit
I'm not Hopsin so I'll tell a bitch to ride my dick
Faggots mad cuz I'm puffing on the dankest grams
Raw with the smackdown, pop rocks at your candy ass

[Hook]
