[Verse 1]
Young man going for the win, yes I am
Meet and greet with Ben Frank I'm his biggest fan
We don't got the time girl, make your mind up
Fuck around and make me hit your friend, bitch get in(woah)
Got me selling raps to keep my daughter flee
Got it for the low, but aim for the cheap
What we smoking on, anything but weed
They was right the revenge taste so sweet
Chris Sutton with me, hit the button
Fake friends got me out here trusting nothing
Ain't no way I'm leaving out of here with nothing
Ain't no playing fair I got to take it from em'
Almost lost my life, 2016
Niggas switch teams, niggas did things
Ooo I can't let em' catch me slippin'
No I can't let em' catch me slippin', wait
I got hatters now I'm doing something different
They bump my shit whatever area you live in
They don't wanna see me rental car with it
They don't wanna see me lay up but I'm living, wait

[Outro]
Because I always feel like running, not away because there's no such place
Because if there was I would've found it by now
Because it's easier to run
Easier then staying and finding out, you're the only one who didn't run
