[Intro]
Yeah, Young Rockie
This shit so official
Shit so offical
Yeah, this shit so official
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Open your eyes you can see for yourself
Man you are tripping, to hate on a nigga, that shit is not good for your health
I'm living my life and all that talking you're doing is nothing to me
I walked in the game, the freshest I came, and forever the freshest I be
There's some money with me
Yeah, take care of the fans, so they know that it's real
When I walk out the land and the kitchen
Have plenty of bands just left in the will
I done took some niggas up out of the hood
I'm lookin' like Uncle Phil
Belair on my table, my bitches stay faithful
And I'm coppin' a feel, all while I'm smokin' my kill
(RIP Uncle Phil)

[Hook]
This shit's so official
This shit's so official
If I'm witchu, I'm witchu
When you roll with a nigga this shit's so official
This shit's so official
They say they can never forget you
If I'm witchu, I'm witchu
When you roll with a nigga this shit's so official

[Verse 2]
I stay on my job, these bitches are serious, I hate a silly ho
We pull up outside, the whip that we drive will be used for his video
Condo in the sky with two different cribs, that's shout out to Peezy though
The way that these niggas and bitches salute me I think I'm a general
Drama is minimal
If it ain't makin' money then why is you winnin' fo'
These niggas is pitiful
They out and they tryna success but they missin' tho
Chill, my cup runneth over and you want the spill
And shout out to my nigga Ricky, he gave me a wonderful deal

[Hook]

[Outro]
This shit's so official x6
