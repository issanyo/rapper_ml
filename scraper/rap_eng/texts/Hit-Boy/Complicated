[Verse 1]
I don't know how else to keep it (keep it)
So I'ma keep it one hunnid (hunnid)
I didn't mean to get your hopes up
I was thinking that's what I wanted (wanted)
Kick-flipped the script on ya (on ya)
Betcha never seen this one comin' (comin')
I'm changing up like autumn
Gotcha heated up like summer

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't say I'm not impressed with you
I'm not ready to invest
I can't say I'm not the girl for you
I just might not be her yet
Feels like all this pressure's on me right now
Like I don't have a choice
Know this much, you can be sure that this
Ain't no 'bout no other boy

[Chorus 1]
'Cause if it was anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Lord knows it would be you
Lord knows it would be you
Before I see anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Boy I'ma come see you
Somethin' always brings me back to you
It's not love, but it's something like that (like that)
It ain't love, but it's something like that (like that)
It's not love, but it's something like that
Boy, it's complicated

[Verse 2]
Now I can tell you're disappointed
Looking at me like we twisted
Tryna figure out where my head at
Everything I told you, I meant it
Bet you thinking I'm feelin' real free now?
But I'm feeling something different
You act like you don't understand, boy
Why don't you just listen?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't say I'm not impressed with you
I'm not ready to invest
I can't say I'm not the girl for you
I just might not be her yet
Feels like all this pressure's on me right now
Like I don't have a choice
Know this much, you can be sure that this
Ain't no 'bout no other boy

[Chorus 1]
'Cause if it was anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Lord knows it would be you
Lord knows it would be you
Before I see anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Boy I'ma come see you
Somethin' always brings me back to you
It's not love, but it's something like that (like that)
It ain't love, but it's something like that (like that)
It's not love, but it's something like that
Boy, it's complicated

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't say I'm not impressed with you
I'm just not ready to invest
I can't say I'm not the girl for you
I just might not be her yet
Feels like all this pressure's on me right now
Like I don't have a choice
Know this much, you can be sure that this
Ain't no 'bout no other boy

[Chorus 2]
'Cause if it was anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Lord knows it would be you
Lord knows it would be you
Before I see anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Boy I'ma come see you
Somethin' always brings me back to you
'Cause if it was anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Lord knows it would be you
You, you, you, you, you
Before I see anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone
Boy I'ma come see you

[Outro]
Ay, I don't know what more to say
