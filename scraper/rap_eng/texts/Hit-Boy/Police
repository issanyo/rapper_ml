[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Ain't no way in hell I can sit back
I see these lil' niggas on the drip jack
Forgiatto clique, we don't like you niggas
Paparazzi here, taking lots of pictures
Broke boy, broke boy, gotta try harder
Diamonds on my chain, boy this real water
I might blow your spot up like Osama
In Leimert Park, I call Dom up
Be careful where you at, that's a jack, boy
Louis 13th with the pack, boy
Niggas try to block me like a goalie
I'm drivin' like I never heard of police
Lately I been really into cooler shit
Hit-Boy got the crib with the pool and shit

[Chorus: 24 Hours]
I shouldn't have to break down the law
Never tell them boys, what you saw

[Verse 2: Jay 305]
Ooh, Jay 305, ooh, make room (Skrt)
I'm doin' a 100 damn Crenshaw, thank you
Prada on the pedal, what that thang do?
Westside money, come and pay dues
Fuck peace, mother fuck the police
Last five years gettin' no sleep
Bang, bang, I told you niggas
I don't really fuck with you niggas
Last time I checked y'all was dick ridin'
What's wrong with you niggas?
No, who raised you?
Sons, I made you
Headshots on headshots
Had 'em spinnin' out like maple
If they pull us over, put this in your bra
No sir, you can't search my car
I'm above the law
Bitch, I don't talk to y'all
Bitch

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I shouldn't have to break down the law
Never tell 'em boys, what you saw
Niggas tryna block me like a goalie
I'm drivin' like I never heard of police
