[Intro: 24hrs]
Big-ass crib and shit
Pool in the back
Fuckin' back-house basketball court

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
"Can I hit it in the morning?"
Right before you go to brunch
I do my stuff, your nigga don't do enough
I can get you that Moschino merchandise
[?] off the water for the night, ayy
First I gotta hit he post office in the kite
Mad black beemers, 'fore I hit 25
I'm still in my twenties, for another 5 months
That's 5 months of dick left for hoes under 21s
Never let a young lame bitch run 'em up
Getting to the gold, [?]
Ain't no way I'ma let you fuck that up
Ain't no way I'ma let you fuck that up
Told her: "Baby, don't run"
Fronto leaf rolled got me so slumped
Ain't shit funny, pussy so good
It need it needs it own GoFundMe
Fall asleep in it and woke up where it's sunny

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
These days I can't complain much
It's just I always hit the same stuff
You the type that I'm gon' only get to blaze once
Laying all up in the crib like a day one
When she introduce me to her friend, I'm like - same, huh?
Had a big fight last month, but we made up
I was pressin' all the right buttons, like SEGA
Bitch, get a Henny, every week, like day, huh
Friend say: "Damn, girl. Is it like that?"
You know we need to do that, I let you make the call
Set it up, we on the same team, get involved
Step up, take the charge, if your nigga [?]
Flow out of this world, hope the Porsche [?] stick
That's my real car, don't rent nothin' ever
If you fake in real life, than you fake on the track
And you never got to worry about me holding you back
Ay, where the pretty girls at?

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I told her: "Don't run from it"
I hit the pussy, til' she done
I hit the pussy, til' she done

[Outro: Dom Kennedy]
Bitch!
International
It's Half-A-Mil shit, yeah
It's international
Players everywhere, worldwide, huh?
