[PART I]

[Verse: AkinG Kalld Pedro]
I'm inclined to get it how I really wanna get it (umm)
In the need of upgrades like pushing honda civics (umm)
Cooking in my kitchen (umm) flipping water whipping
Peep the flick of my wrist I'm shocking G's when it was written
I changed my rank class just to move the weight I'm watching
Moving weight like liposuction in the belly of the beast
That's greedy and obese and thugging like South-East
But growing like a yeast infection on your shortie's pussy
Don't compare me to no rookie, AKP's the Antidote
I can put that on my Hoodie (Aye Moe, You the GOAT!)
What you want a fucking cookie I already know I've been a pro
Prophesied to fucking blow, watch your mouth I might explode
When I'm coming bitch I'm at your throat like a bookie
While I flow like a boat when it's rowed
I'm important like the pope you a roach better quote it
Understand, this my show, tune into my episode cuz I'm Truman
You false like illusions the problems to solutions
I'm DBZ fusions of Hip-Hop and Jazz Funk
That's Kendrick mix with Esperanza Spalding, not no Daft Punk
It's already been proven I'm pimping like I'm running
Chocolate City's prostitution, forgive me, I'm Human
With a few jokes rapping on sicko mode
Don't impose what you know you can't expose

[PART II]

[Into]
Check 1,2,1,2,1,2 yeah
I'm Trying to get paid, uh!

[Bridge: AkinG Kalld Pedro & iLoveMastermane]
I'm sick and still in my mode, reaching the end of the zone
Scoring and finishing goals, respecting the game with a code
(Maybe we're going in circles, It's all like a cycle or the letter O
Baby with me you might just find the glow
Baby I mean it, I've seen it, the prettiest, prettiest glow)
Baby you know I'm the glow, spreading the light like a glow
Spreading the light like a glow, E40, I'm ready to go!

[Verse: AkinG Kalld Pedro]
I spit like I foam at the mouth, you might think that I'm crazy
Shitty rappers bite other styles, them niggas got rabies
I'm tryna get paid, young, black and self-made
Y'all niggas just sucking dicking and never wanna build cuz y'all lazy!
I'm tryna drop hits and make a classic like Section.80
Niggas blowing my high, but I won't bite the bait
Rappers hit me up talking about collabs I hit them the maybe
They turn around and throw shade, I tell go push daisies
My roses don't stink, Caroline knows I got the juice
Your co-sign thinks your obtuse, I set fire when I'm in the booth
I got no issues to reproduce, a role model like shady
You nervous bitches are shaking like parkinson i make the crowd move
Y'all the kids on the stoop?
I'm Angela Bassett and back on my groove
I not taking chances to make an excuse
Fantastic the static I'm like Dr. Doom
I'm earning my stripes like I am a raccoon
They cancel your shit give you no reboots
They cancel your shit and they calling #metoo
A toxin, a cancer, that's here to pollute
We disapprove of taboos no call for truce
We murder the stupid spoofs
I always let hell loose in this bitch
Like we are committing domestic abuse
I murder every goof, every crew I'm too hard like Baton Rogue
Track I do beat it till it's black and blue
I'm in cue cuz I got nothing to lose
