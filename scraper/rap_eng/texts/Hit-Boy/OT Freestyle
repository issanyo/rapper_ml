[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Aww man, zoom
Damn, damn
Zoom

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Feedback crazy in my headphones
Made a million this year, I'm from the ghetto
I put in overtime, I put in overtime
We win it in regulation, we don't go to overtime
Cause we put in overtime, I gotta overshine
Cause I put in overtime, nigga I overgrind
Nigga I overgrind, I put in overtime
I put in overtime
(turn my vocal up, please my nigga
I need it right now, let's get this shit poppin')
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I put in overtime, I put in overtime
We win it in regulation, we don't go to overtime
I put in overtime, I put in overtime
Quentin Miller on the phone, damn
We put in overtime
We put in overtime, damn, we put in overtime
Quentin Miller on the phone, damn
We put in over
Ayo some.. ayo you outside?

[Verse 2: Quentin Miller]
Yeah, right outside the Nike store
Right inside your dream girl
My life deserves a movie score
Young Quentin Miller, aka Rap Game Hans Zimmer
Shine my light while y'all glimmer
Hit LA, I call hitter, what the move is?
Y'all dudes been lookin' moveless
For a smooth minute, talkin' about how my crew livin'
While your crew didn't
Seem to get mentioned
You seen the whip, didn't you?
It's classic shit, man
It's classic shit, man
Me and Hit-Boy make classic shit, man
Press the button on the fuel band, flash the wrist, nigga what's up

[Verse 3: Hit-Boy]
I put in overtime
Soakin' in sun rays, out in Miami on Ocean Drive
I knew that I would be the shit back when I was only 9
Cause I put in overtime, and nigga I overgrind
Avoidin' old hoes on my line, puttin' in overtime
I thought she'd get over me, over time
