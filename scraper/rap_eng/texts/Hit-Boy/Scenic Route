[Verse 1: Quentin Miller & TheCoolisMac]
Yeah, scenic route
Peep how we move, nigga, it's genius moves
Y'all be on that back and forth like Venus and Serena do
We tryna [?] like Blake Griffin in that Kia, ooh
Back when niggas had no kid's
I was puttin' Hip-hop first like Sophia
Hit 'em where it hurts, leave 'em bleeding, ooh
You know it's gotta be you if it's me and you, man
I don't know what kinda people you been-
Hangin' around, what they say about you?
I know you feel some kind of way they way I'm movin' out here
Battle scars from how I beat the ground up
We ain't mad at all, we made a way up out it
Despite how the dirt on my name had piled up
UTD that never changed, not once (not once, yeah)
Screamin' 1317, now what? (yeah, yeah, okay)

[Verse 2: TheCoolisMac]
Welcome to the future, cop this game online, pay shit (pay up)
OG said get up off that pot [?] (get up)
That 'finite will fit your gang if y'all wanna get in
Lingo clear [?] my LA niggas [?] (turn up in here, damn)
He got the Yeezy's just to fit in (haha, what)
I got Jordan's on for 2010 (believe that)
Huh, huh, they only count wins (okay, yeah)
I know I get under your skin with them Gucci lens (turn up in here)
Yeah, yeah, shawty give me the [?]
Goin' off, I can't defend, Steph no Curry [?] (damn)
Saw that dial then I can't honor ya (not at all)
But I blow'd up like Stevie Wonder, harmonica
Yeah, turn the strip club to Hanukkah (yeah, you do)
Off-white when the times rush (oh my god)
