[Intro: Hit-Boy]
How we rockin'
It's how we rockin'
Bang, bang
Bang, bang

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Not to be a social misfit
I don't trust a soul in this shit
Know a few niggas still hittin' licks
Catch me stackin', tryin' to get rich
Grinding like the third member of Clipse
Talk strips in a hurry
Or I'm skatin' like roller derby
They sleepin' on a nigga but I'm sturdy
She missin', I get her back home by 2:30
19-42 to the neck, shit I'm swerving
Niggas lurkin' I can't let 'em do me dirty, aw man
I see how I gotta play it
I see niggas still think I'm playin'
Slow down dawg, you talkin' too fast
Ya'll can pop shit, I'mma pop bands
Green day, every day, rock band
Hit-Boy, bitch I got the hi hat
No tints, so you know who's in
No do-over so I'm goin' in
Long way from the decks under the do-rag
I'm at the light they like, nigga how you do dat?
Lone wolf, tryna stay humble, man
Ask my [?], than I hit the money dance, yeah

[Bridge: Sample]

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Solid through the ups and the downs
Like six-fours, [?]
Transactions in the tea top trans-am
I was given no choice, but to get it out the drop
You can hear my heart pouring out
You can feel my soul through these beats
No apologies, I'm not the same me
Say goodbye to the good guy
It's only so many chances, so I took my
[?]
Phone call with my legal, what it look like?
Pop corks for the pain, let's have a good life
Good life, good life, yeah, look
Hit the playback, bet I snap
Ain't talking to app with the ghost logo
Working this hard, they know where we gon' go, bro
HB creepin' on the low, solo
No backup, I don't need a nigga to cover me
Tree lit up, that Ace bubbly
If you was in my position, you'll be bucklin'
This who y'all fuckin' with, that's puzzlin'
I'm done tryin' put this shit together, b
Run a diamond test, the ice water in these rings
New jewels, for the clique, seem clean
It's not regular, pimp, pimp-y
Niggas ain't been in the corners I been
Left my sack a benjamins, bust a bitch back to the crib
Gotta keep it under raps what I spend
Too many niggas and hoes, I can't confide it, damn
Not to be a social misfit
I don't trust a soul in this shit
Know a few niggas still hittin' licks
Catch me stackin', tryin' to get rich
Grinding like the third member of Clipse, ayy

[Outro: Hit-Boy]
I don't eye shit
Hit-Boy on the beat
