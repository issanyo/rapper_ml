Part 1: Told You So

[Hook: Kent Jamz]
I, I told you so
You said I love you, I should have ran away
I knew I'd hate you when I saw your face, yeah
I, I told you so
You said I love you, I should have ran away
I knew I'd hate you when I saw your face, yeah

[Verse 1: Oktane]
Old couples make you realize someone can love you forever
Young ones make it look impossible to stay together
Too many niggas treat these hoes like ladies, ladies like hoes
And I treated you like gold till you got tired & concert tickets got sold
And now we keep this love at the distance while I'm on the road
I see these hoes out here and don't want none of them
Too many mediocre things in life love can't be one of them
So I told her: "Look, don't talk just do and don't say just move
And don't promise just lose yourself in love with this groove
Because you make me happy I didn't die before I met you
And you get me pissed off sometimes but I never sweat you
Cause these girls see these bottles popping & may see all the cars
But we're searching for someone who's demons play well with ours
I'm not perfect but neither are you, either we see that in truce
Or you believe what are they speaking is true and leave us blue

[Hook: Kent Jamz]
I, I told you so
You said I love you, I should have ran away
I knew I'd hate you when I saw your face, yeah
I, I told you so
You said I love you, I should have ran away
I knew I'd hate you when I saw your face, yeah

[Verse 2: Price]
This feel like Xxplosive, West Coast shit
Never trust ratchet bitches that smoke roaches
Just put your hands to the sky, get your heart in the mood
Pull your love by your side, break out your grand daddy moves and groove
That's right, because you probably never had this chance again in your life
To take all the pain and drown it out
You make mistakes but who's keepin' count?
Yeah, you might fail but ride with me
And let's pretend we love each other, fuck until we fall asleep
And live forever ever ever, ever ever, ever ever

[Hook: Kent Jamz]
I, I told you so
You said I love you, I should have ran away
I knew I'd hate you when I saw your face, yeah
I, I told you so
You said I love you, I should have ran away
I knew I'd hate you when I saw your face, yeah

Part 2: Block Party

[Intro]
Tear drops and all
Heartbreaks and flaws
We've both got our ways
We both tried to change it
And we both made mistakes
But you must have found a new savior
Cause when you were in danger I was your Red Ranger
How we become strangers?
Man, this love shit is the strangest
Block Party

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Damn, feelings deep enough to drown in
The homie's still here, yeah we still smoking ounces
But all I can think about is you, baby
All I can think about is you, baby
Feels like I've been sitting, still ain't have no visits
Do you still look at the pictures, do you still miss us?
Do you still carry the bag I got you for Christmas?
That's the best I had ever had first night that I hit it
I was on some drunk shit, you was on some in-it-for-the-love shit
Talking on the phone, we Instagramming on some stunt shit
Single in the city it's so hard be on them cope
When them girls come and go but they don't never really go
I mean they go but I mean they ho, when I say that and that for sure
You come meet me in the Sena, I keep that shit on the low
I remember won't forget, I made a promise to your heart
I'd hit restart if I could but I'm a play this for the hood like

[Outro]
And I ain't gonna sit up and act like I don't think about you
Or get up on this microphone with my friends and sing about you
But baby, baby, there is something about you
And that's for me to know and you to pray that one day God lets you find out... Block Party
