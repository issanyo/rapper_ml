[Hook]
Dippin' yeah I'm still dippin'
In your neighborhood on 20 inches tippin'
New wrist work it don't do no ticking
Bake ash tray where my backwoods sit in
Tony of my city Tony of my city yeah
Tony of my city Tony of my city yeah
(?) 77  chain plays on plays like I serve cocaine

[Verse 1]
Fuck them stunting's a habit
Send off the package my youngin's packin
What's being broke gone solve? They can't take no loss
I'm at a loss for words, niggas is fraud confirmed
I just iced out my half a mil pendant
Did a logo to the jeweler sent it
Diamonds dancing like they dashin big pimpin
I can't make no moves if my heart ain't in it
Press the button jump out the coupe
Can't be scared to look out for you
I stack (?) out the loot
Flying at a whole nother altitude
You don't know nothing about the dude
What you heard about me ain't my concern
Everybody ain't for everybody
Tthat's one thing that you gotta learn

[Hook]
So I'm dippin' yeah I'm still dippin'
In your neighborhood on 20 inches tippin'
New wrist work it don't do no ticking
Bake ash tray where my backwoods sit in
Tony of my city Tony of my city yeah
Tony of my city Tony of my city yeah
(?) 77  chain plays on plays like I'm serving cocaine

[Verse 2]
Tony of my city yeah I'm too litty
Fifth for a Barnies spent like two fifty
If you ain't got a play in motion you can't move with me
Swerve through the learning curve HB I'm rule bending
Cooking like its two kitchens
If it's murder on the track then you know dude did it
Tryna grey coupe kit it
Believe in something, starting with yourself or you'll fall to someone else
Oh no we just stacked Os on Os
Olympic rings flipping through the goals
You can't flake up what is you niggas pose
Under developed my eyes well up
Picking my melon, we're all we got
Used to do laps in Ontario Mills parking lot
Tryna make a jam good enough to sell
Younch Chauncey I put the C in clientele
No thanks to you niggas we straight
Till I'm 50 in Miami with a bag for a belly
Nigga I'ma keep getting to it it's nothing
