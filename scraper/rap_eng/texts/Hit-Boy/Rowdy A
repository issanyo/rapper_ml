[Intro]
I am very high and very drunk
Where are we?

[Hook]
Attention kids, roll up an ounce
Light up and smoke it in swollen amounts
We are the niggas they warned you about
I thought I told y'all get the fuck up and bounce
I thought I told y'all get the fuck up and bounce
I thought I told y'all get the fuck up n HOL UP

[Verse 1: Oktane]
Naw you little bitch that ain't incense, roll up
Light up, inhale, exhale, slow up
They shouldn't be talking all that bitch grow up
Take your weed ignite it then blow up
Dynamite C4 we are show up
Now I'm on stage got damn it I'm tore up
Bounce bitch, bounce, I don't need that slot shit in my house
Never need all that, she'll take that
And then bust back and do it all with her mouth
Word to Travis young niggas back
Bitch I blast this and make niggas back flip
Young gifted bastards all back at rap
You should all react like you love it bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Price Tag]
No, I swear these niggas acting like hoes
These women acting like bitches theres
Way to many ricos and not enough money making bitches, damn shame
Oh oh, young crips growin up we was little C's like we was B.I NIGGA
From the city where there ain't shit free but I'm still screaming free my niggas
B-O-Dub gang and you're talking to the presidente
Ever since the tenth grade me and my niggas been taking off days like barbers that need their rent payed
Run that bounce that, show your heart
I ride with animals, Noah's ark
I'm a fuck her good and I'm a take her home
And I'm a make her sit in the back like Rosa Parks
Thats Price, don't ask no more
Pass the blunt, you better ask before
Pass the bottle we don't drink out cups
Young niggas run the game, don't walk round us, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Oktane]
Shut up!
Trying to get at the thought of me and combine it with sodomy
And it won't be as baddest as it ought to be
I gotta be a prodigy if you choose outta your three favorite rappers you're gonna swallow me
I am the black Chuck Norris or Van Dame
I don't give a damn damn, or two fucks or one shit
Whether you come with an army or one clip, I'm shooting like dice
Now fuck you where's Price

[Verse 4: Pricetag & Oktane]
[Price Tag]
I make this paper stress like fold out, beds
Real nigga never sold out
And I probably can hear you the haters talking
If my fucking weed wasn't sold loud
But it is, so what it is same clique never switched real shit
And I ain't sticking to no bitch unless her name is this script
Hold on !
You know the plan, you know I can't
Be holdin the hands, all i wanted was a pole dance
Then I'm superman that ho like a Soulja dance
And then kicked her to the curb like a soda can
[Oktane]
You know this man and now I can probably say
That now today the I.E's down the stay
And now we pray for everybody round the way
Rest in peace this beat and Rowdy A
