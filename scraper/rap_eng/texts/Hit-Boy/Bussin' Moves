[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Brought Givenchy to the ghetto, you know who let the dogs out
Rottweiler t-shirts with their paws out
Who ain't fly? Fuck you niggas tal'm 'bout?
When these birds of paradise got their claws out
Niggas rentin' for their videos to ball out
Woo! The Spyder's mine if I crawl out
God! We 4-wheelin' 'cross 4 acres
Nigga, fuck you stuntin' in a dollhouse?
Ha! This is concentrated teamwork
Yes! My foundation triple beam work
My codefendants ain't codependent
Nah, G.O.O.D. Music where we screen first

[Hook: Hit-Boy]
Still bussin' moves like I'm Mike Jack
Moonwalkin' to the money bags
Bankroll callin', got a nigga dancin'
Dopeman, servin' in a Thriller jacket
Still, still bussin' moves
Bussin' moves, bussin' moves (zoom)
Still, still bussin' moves
Bussin' moves, bussin' moves

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Hit-Boy, still bussin'
Big moves bein' made, by the dozen
Gold chains on my neck, zoomin' out in public
Got the Kenwood face, 2 15 subbin'
I'm gettin' large amounts
She gon' go, ain't shit to talk about
Only, only young nigga in the opera house
Sayin' too much that is not allowed while I'm off the loud
Hit it, toss it out
That's how the game go
Slip two racks to the waiter, she can keep the change though
Zoomin' in my lane, hoe, that'll never stop
They love my shit when it drop, I'm the ghetto Bach
Clockin' hella knots and I'm

[Hook: Hit-Boy]
Still bussin' moves like I'm Mike Jack
Moonwalkin' to the money bags
Bankroll callin', got a nigga dancin'
Dopeman, servin' in a Thriller jacket
Still, still bussin' moves
Bussin' moves, bussin' moves (zoom)
Still, still bussin' moves
Bussin' moves, bussin' moves
Still, still bussin' moves
Bussin' moves, bussin' moves (zoom)
Still, still bussin' moves
Bussin' moves, bussin' moves

[Verse 3: Quentin Miller]
Okay lowkey I've been puttin' on for a minute
Money keep comin' in so I keep spendin'
Chain hang down to my appendix
Like Pimp C I'm big pimpin'
Big Zs when you use zoomin' in a sentence
Yeah, yeah, okay we've been puttin' on for a minute, minute, okay
Okay my team been puttin' on for a minute
Young QM, rap game Harry Potter
New slave game, Nike on us like we sponsored
