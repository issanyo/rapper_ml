[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Since them Nautica competitions
We been pimping
Jean jacket collard up like we in New Edition
Tell whoever got the aux cord slide this in
We’ll take them 12 bars I can say it in 4
I had her sleep after sex snoring that’s what I know
She waking up at 9:30 like where did he go
I’m in the spot with Hit Boy reviewing all the numbers
Aye It’s still good to be the man when don't nobody love you
I could’ve fucked you pretty ass long time ago
I turned down all kinds of hoes
I’m a real city nigga
You real nerds better understand me
I’m trying to hit the lottery like Marcus Camby
Who you with

[Pre-Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
Am I the reason why you fix you hair
Can I get a lap dance when I’m in that chair
All my bars be like truth or dare
Tree in my zig zags always come prepared
You know I’m going to keep it playa

[Chorus: Hit Boy]
Link up every time we link up I feel like that's all me
Wanna fuck me baby pull up at  Le Parc Suites
Grammy Davis Jr. working on the second Grammy
I ain’t ready for a family send postmates to get the Plan B

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
And I’m not superstitious don’t blame this on bad luck
You might’ve heard me on a song with DJ Quik in bad luck
So how you want to take off your clothes and tax us
I ain’t saving nothing in my contacts much
Shit you’ll do it right now if you want it bad enough
My 7 digits worth 7 figures add it up
Block numbers go unanswered
Streets is watching life’s a gamble
You can have your girl back I want the ransom
Might see my BM driving a phantom
Need the grey Chipper Jones that say Atlanta
Be careful in LA ooh they scandalous
Where it’s all good and sunny
Thug life on the tummy

[Pre-Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
Am I the reason why you fix you hair
Can I get a lap dance when I’m in that chair
All my bars be like truth or dare
Tree in my zig zags always come prepared
You know I’m going to keep it playa

[Chorus: Hit Boy]
Link up every time we link up I feel like that's all me
Wanna fuck me baby pull up at the Le Parc Suites
Grammy Davis Jr. working on the second Grammy
I ain’t ready for a family send postmates to get the Plan B
