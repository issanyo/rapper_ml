[Verse]
Hoppin' off the 66 in Amsterdam
Young Afghanistan
Droppin' bombs, liquid swords cuttin' through your ambulance
Won't stand a chance, young [?] avalanche
[?] caravan [?]
Hand the masks out, for the cameraman
Curtis Snow, Curtis Blow
Show before the curtains blow
Smokey got the [?]
Shootin' like [?]
Eatin' greens, smokin' green
All about the herbal growth
Leavin' lean on the surface though
Black activist, black magic shit
I'm the catalyst for savage shit
Slangin' drugs at the [?]
Attitude, fuck the judge
Yeah, fuck the Vatican
Fuck republicans, we sufferin'
Just a puff again
Standin' on my own two
Cannon with a coat too
Duece nigga shoot nigga
Casper, go poof, nigga
Ya ghost feel me
I tote semi’s
And toast henny
In stanley cups
I can’t be touched
Ball
