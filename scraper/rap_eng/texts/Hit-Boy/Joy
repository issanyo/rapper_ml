[Verse One: Ryan McDermott]
I look for you in the bodies of models
In the bottoms of bottles, in the picture of fame
I look for you in the comfort of money
And I find it so funny that I tried to blame
Tried to blame it on you like you just had me playing a game
But I’ve been the one that’s playing, forgive me

[Hook]
Joy, you’re the one that I’ve been searching for
Oh Joy, you’re the only one that gives me all this
Joy you’re the one that I been looking for
But it seems like you’re always disguised
Joy I just wanna believe when you tell me
That you’re gonna make it alright

[Verse Two: Ryan McDermott]
I look for you in the depths of the sea
In the caves of my mind, in the ache of my plea
I look for you in the flux of the wind
In the faces of lovers that welcome my sins
And I wish I could find you and tell you, where do I begin?
‘Cause I want you to know that I need you always

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Hit-Boy]
We been going steady, shit is getting heavy
And I don’t know if I’m ready but I’m willing to see
I’m feeling some things that I ain’t never felt
I ain’t never knew, so incredible
High rise, that’s a better view
Where we shade up or laid up
They haters but we don’t give a fuck
We just courtside with the Lakers
That’s ballin’, catch up, yeah
We stay flexed up, that’s the way we gotta keep it
Never keep a secret, fuck who don’t believe it
Girl, you know I need a…

[Hook]
Joy, you’re the one that I’ve been searching for
Oh Joy, you’re the only one that gives me all this
Joy you’re the one that I been looking for
But it seems like you’re always disguised
Joy I just wanna believe when you tell me
That you’re gonna make it alright
Joy, you’re the one that I’ve been searching for
Oh Joy, you’re the only one that gives me all this
Joy you’re the one that I been looking for
But it seems like you’re always disguised
Joy I just wanna believe when you tell me
That you’re gonna make it alright
Give me a sign, oh, give me a sign
