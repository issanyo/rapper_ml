[Intro: YG]
Oh this can’t be America
Y’all badge don’t mean
Y’all got the right to take one of my niggas lives

[Hook: YG]
We don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
We don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
Nigga we don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
The police get away with murder
We don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
That’s why we don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
Nigga we don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
So you better leave your house with a burner

[Verse 1: YG]
My whoadie got hit up then my whoadie got hit up
I ain’t trying to be one of them niggas
But if they catch you with the strap and you black, it’s a wrap
Two years with half, that’s what the judge give em
I’m psyched out cause I’m already striped out
But if I get caught without one (then my lights out)
I’m psyched out cuz I’m already striped out
But if I get caught without one (then my lights out)
It get real in the field, your honor
How we supposed to chill when there’s no chill your honor
Niggas running in your crib your honor
Tell me what the fuck you would have did your honor
You would have got you a strap too
AK grenades, a shotgun and a mac too
You would have told your kids to hide
At the front door squeezing on that trigger with pride

[Hook: YG]
We don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
We don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
Nigga we don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
The police get away with murder
We don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
That’s why we don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
Nigga we don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
So you better leave your house with a burner

[Verse 2: YG]
This that they don’t want us South side shit
Gotta watch how I walk and wear my outfit
White tan brown black, white tan brown black
We only a couple shades darker how we outfit
Black males in a hoodie that’s a target to them
They say he oversized and choked him out that was harmless to them
They’ll hit us and try to blame it like I ain’t owe this to them
But fuck it, I’m waking my people making it harder for them
See, the illuminati hide shit they don’t tell us
Well it’s the nigga money cuz my niggas I’m gon tell them
The truth motherfucker, hear the truth motherfucker
I’ve really got a story, this ain’t a spoof motherfucker
We’ll put our hands up and they’ll still shoot motherfucker
And post on trial for one to two motherfucker
They give us years for guns and we can buy em off the shelf
But you’ll get life in the coffin if you don’t protect yourself

[Hook: YG]
We don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
We don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
Nigga we don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
The police get away with murder
We don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
That’s why we don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
Nigga we don’t give a fuck, we don’t give a fuck
So you better leave your house with a burner

[Outro: YG]
Y'all murdered Tyler Woods in Long Beach
He was innocent
Y’all murdered 17 year old David Joseph who died in Texas
He was unarmed
Y’all murdered 16 year old Kimani Gray in New York City March 9, 2013
That was my birthday, He was unarmed
This shit fucked up man
Y’all murdered Laquan McDonald in Chicago
They got that on tape
He was innocent
And the list goes on
And they wonder why I live life looking over my shoulder
