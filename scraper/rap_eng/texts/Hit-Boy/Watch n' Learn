[Verse 1]
Won’t say a thing
About the way you love me
Except for, I like the way
I love the way you touch me

[Pre-Chorus]
If I toot it, leave it tooted up
Then I drop it, drop it
Till ya making faces
And look like you wanna
Tell me stop it
Imma do it, do it, do it
Till you can't take no more
Till my lipstick ain't up on my face no more
I’mma do it do it do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only 'cause your lips ain't make it to my mouth
Just because I can’t kiss back
Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss that

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’s your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’s your turn now
Watch and learn now, watch and learn how
Watch and learn now, eh-eh-eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I’ll stay

[Verse 2]
Don’t ask me if
You were the first to sleep here
'Cause if he did, you wouldn’t even be here

[Pre-Chorus]
If I toot it, leave it tooted up
Then I drop it, drop it
Till ya making faces
And look like you wanna
Tell me stop it
Imma do it, do it, do it
Till you can't take no more
Till my lipstick ain't up on my face no more
I’mma do it do it do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only 'cause your lips ain't make it to my mouth
Just because I can’t kiss back
Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss that

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’s your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’s your turn now
Watch and learn now, watch and learn how
Watch and learn now, eh-eh-eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I’ll stay

[Bridge]
Come put my love against your kiss (oh, na-na-na)
La-la-la, just like this
Na-na, don’t be shy
Baby, all I need
Oh, do it on me
Like you aim to please
Show me how much you mean it
By the way you please me, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I’mma do it do it do it
On the bed, on the floor, on the couch
Only 'cause your lips ain't make it to my mouth
Just because I can’t kiss back
Doesn’t mean you can’t kiss that

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, just like that
Slow, baby, baby, just like that
Oh, baby, baby, turn me out
Oh, baby, baby, it's your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’s your turn now
It’s your turn now, it’s your turn now
Watch and learn now, watch and learn how
Watch and learn now, eh-eh-eh
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

[Outro]
If you learn now, if you learn now
If you learn how, I’ll stay
