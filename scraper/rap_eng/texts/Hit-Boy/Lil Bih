[Intro]
Ooh, skrr
Yeah

[Chorus: Madeintyo]
My new lil bih
I was in Paris, thought I hit (Skrt skrt skrt)
Fuck Donald Trump, politics (Politics)
Fast and Furious, no Ludacris (Skrt skrt skrt)
Ouh
My new lil bih
I was in Paris, thought I hit (Skrt skrt skrt)
Fuck Donald Trump, politics (Politics)
Fast and Furious, no Ludacris (Skrt skrt skrt)

[Verse 1: Madeintyo]
Ooh, we had to go harder
20 my brother, we stay by the martyr
That pussy go crazy
Got me a bed, and you thought that you played me
Getting that butter like Washington Carver
Think I didn't have a daughter
Getting that top in the heels (Ouh)
Splash, jump in the water
You was on the bench
You wasn't even a starter
Miami by the slide
Use no hands when I ride
I got a Benz in Dubai
Cutting the slice of the pie
Cutting the slice of the pie
I got my head on her thigh

[Chorus: Madeintyo]
My new lil bih
I was in Paris, thought I hit (Skrt skrt skrt)
Fuck Donald Trump, politics (Politics)
Fast and Furious, no Ludacris (Skrt skrt skrt)
Ouh
My new lil bih
I was in Paris, thought I hit (Skrt skrt skrt)
Fuck Donald Trump, politics (Politics)
Fast and Furious, no Ludacris (Skrt skrt skrt)

[Verse 2: 24Hrs]
24 Hours!
Post a picture
9 times out of 10, don't need no caption
Toyko, that my dog, I can't lose homie
Don't trust a bank, I got 500 blues on me
My real life, it should be my video
Google twenty, you'll see I'm CEO
(Yeah yeah, yeah, woo) What you say behind my back?
That could get you wacked
This 10 years in the game
I don't fuck with lames

[Chorus: Madeintyo]
My new lil bih
I was in Paris, thought I hit (Skrt skrt skrt)
Fuck Donald Trump, politics (Politics)
Fast and Furious, no Ludacris (Skrt skrt skrt)
Ouh
My new lil bih
I was in Paris, thought I hit (Skrt skrt skrt)
Fuck Donald Trump, politics (Politics)
Fast and Furious, no Ludacris (Skrt skrt skrt)

[Outro: Madeintyo]
Air force ones they lunatic
Ooh, spending hella racks on Fendi fit
Air force ones they lunatic
Ooh, spending racks on Louis fits
