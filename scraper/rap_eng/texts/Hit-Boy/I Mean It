[Intro: Hit-Boy]
No time is wasted, I came through the complication
I been awful patient, my deposit savings goin’ up
Only took a little concentration growin’ up
In the game, the mission to slow you up if you let it
Nigga, I should get a golden glove and a pennant how I’m winnin’ now
Run me my money, nigga, give it up in a big amount

[Verse 1: PJ]
I think with people you can tell the difference
From those that had it and the ones that didn’t
Look where I’m at and look at my condition
I didn’t then but I accept I’m different
How else could you explain the way I’m bout to get it?
Cause when you honest that’s when niggas listen
They say money comes and goes, I hope I keep it
On everything, I hope I keep it

[Chorus: PJ]
Cause when I say I want it all
Nigga I mean it
Nigga I mean it
When I say that I won’t stop for nobody
Nigga I mean it
Trust me I mean it
Whoa, whoa
Nigga I mean it
Whoa, whoa
Nigga I mean it

[Verse 2: PJ]
My life’s a story, they don’t hafta read it
Sooner or later they gon’ pay attention
My family callin’ me like P you did it
It’s just level 1 but trust I’m bout to get it
And I forgave niggas and they opinions
It’s funny now you got a different feelin’
But all my life there’s nothin’ more appealin’
Then to know that you this close to winnin’

[Chorus: PJ]
Cause when I say I want it all
Nigga I mean it
Nigga I mean it
When I say that I won’t stop for nobody
Nigga I mean it
Trust me I mean it
Whoa, whoa
Nigga I mean it
Whoa, whoa
Nigga I mean it

[Verse 3: Hit-Boy]
I’m on a reach for glory
Fuck who don’t see it for me
I repeat the story, I’mma keep rejoicing
Young boy, blessed like I bet a sneeze is over
I keeps composure my English teacher can’t spell my future
I wasn’t into math anyway
On the schoolyard getting paid
Liquor [?] on a ball, student on the dice, just to get a lemonade
Shit, we was onto great things since Grey Street, mainly
I been on the match like the A-Team
Ain’t no mystery, I need ten gold chains like Mr. T
Nigga, stayin’ on a bitch ain’t meant for me
That’s like a middle seat in coach
All you need to know
Bein’ real and stayin’ down
I got a history of both

[Chorus: PJ]
Cause when I say I want it all
Nigga I mean it
Nigga I mean it
When I say that I won’t stop for nobody
Nigga I mean it
Trust me I mean it
Whoa, whoa
Nigga I mean it
Whoa, whoa
Nigga I mean it
