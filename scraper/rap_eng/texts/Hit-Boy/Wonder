[Verse 1:]
If I never had the pain that I had
Would I be a stronger day
Or would I just gave up

And if I didn't write love
Would you give me a chance?
Hey
Would I have found my way
Or would I had gave up?

[Chorus:]
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder
Uh, I wonder
Would you still love me

And would you even care, uh
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder
Wonder would it be like, like, like, like, like
Wonder would it be like, like, like, like, like

[Verse 2:]
If I never share a tear or care
About the ones who need to hear
If I made it loud
Then you can make it out

How many survivors in heal that wanna know the truth
I'm no better than you
We can do together to the start to the weather
I'll be there for you

[Repeat Chorus:]

I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder
Oh, yes, I will
I wonder, wonder wonder wonder wonder
Uh, I wonder
Would you still love me

And would you even care
Uh, yeah
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder
Wonder would it be like, like, like, like, like
Wonder would it be like, like, like, like, like

[Bridge:]
If you feel that the struggle is over
And you know that you major out
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
Something that hear you say

If you got love for me, for me
Like I got love for you
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing with me

[Repeat Chorus:]

Would it be like?
Oh, I wonder
Aha
