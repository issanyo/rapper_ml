You won free tickets come out and play when you come to town
Its like a season finale of a drama show
Sorry my guy that ain’t birth control
She swallowed a white tic tac whole
Welcome to the freak show freak show
Ay Welcome to the freak show freak show
Are you satan or an alien
You’re a princess when you’re naked
Are you Christmas Day or New Years eve
Will you steal my faith and make me believe
Shed a tear throw a knife
Cry baby bitch you better run and hide
Are You black listed or vip
If you exit theres no re entry
You red eyes or visine
Do you rewind do you skip scenes
And i’m thinking i’m thinking i’m thinking
I might I’m thinking how I been wasting my time
Im wasting my time I’m wasting my life

I make bad decisions everyday of my life
I make bad decisions everyday of my life
I make bad decisions everyday of my life
I make bad decisions everyday of my life

Clear, clear as day clear as night clear the hate
You don’t know me you don’t have a mother fucking clue
Settle down you’re acting like a fucking clown
You think that you know better, well wheres you’re hit boy record
Ooh
Things come and then things go and then things always unfold
You hit me then I bounce back because I always go with the flow
I ain’t saying I’m right I’ll probably never know why I’m just saying

I make bad decisions everyday of my life
I make bad decisions everyday of my life
I make bad decisions everyday of my life

I make bad decisions everyday of my life

Get out yeah
Get out of my Head theres something wrong

I make bad decisions everyday of my life

Bad decisions every day of my life

I make bad decisions everyday of my life (every single day of my life)
