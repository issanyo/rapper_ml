Hello, hello button
Why you actin' stubborn
I know last time wasn’t
Worth all of your coming
But pick your chin up work with me tonight
This time I swear he'll do it right
Yes, he'll do it right
Oh, he'll do it right

Listen to me button
Even if he's frontin'
Still pucker up and show him
How tight you can hold him
Make it slip and slide the way you do
And this ride may be more fun for you
And I’ll have more fun too
I’ll have more fun too
So

Hang in there a little while longer button
I think the finish line is getting real closer button
Now he's getting and he's squeezing and he's screaming
When he's done he'll be gettin' up leavin'
Hang in there a little while longer button

Pack your shit up button
This was disappointing
Didn’t know he couldn't
Handle all your pulsing
Should have listened to you all along
I'll take care of you
When he goes home
Can’t wait till he goes home
Wait till he goes home

Hang in there a little while longer button

Now he's getting and he's squeezing and he's screaming
When he's done he'll be gettin' up leavin'
