Clears throat

[Verse 1: Bro Sampson]
Ball so hard, game delay
I don't give a fuck man I came to play
All over the world and got the sweet sound so you can call me Amazing Grace
When I'm Pissin white I drink gatorade, avoid kryptonite so I save the day
And these haters gettin' mad cause I got me some bathanapes
It's Thunderous and I'm out here with my rain coat, fuck you
Niggas smaller than duck food and I'm sittin' tall on them mushrooms
The only rule that I live by is you fuck around and you will die
Underground so I'm runnin' 'round with that burner, Bill Nye
Flow cold, I'm a chill guy but thats quick to change if you YOLO
Hit the brakes or this clique'll spray cause bitch this ain't a new polo
Blood on my boat shoes, no socks thats road rules
This real world and I'm too frat so we get higher than Goku on that Kaio-Ken
Firemen try to put us out they better try again
I'm Pullin' strings like a violin
We take ya life that's bio chem
(My) cable network's Fios and my favorite sweatshirts piled in my closet
Hope you watch it 'fore that label gets ya filed in
WNBA
El rulo el pie
Condujo en viste
And please don't listen to what we say
We got that work and it's all pre-paid so in advance better call three days
And if you need, gotta have leeway
I get my 'preme from around E-bay
I give a fuck what she say you catch elbows like metta
Turn yo shit red if you in bellos white sweater
Hell knows I'm better, Overlord and Miley Cyrus bitch
A tiny scientist just be prepared for 9096
