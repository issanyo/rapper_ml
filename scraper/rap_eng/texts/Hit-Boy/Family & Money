[Intro]
24hrs and you know it's Hit-Boy
Been taking wins after wins now
Told my dog we ain’t coming down
Been taking wins after wins now
I told my dog we ain't coming down
We ain't coming down
I told my dog we ain’t coming down

[Verse 1]
I was wishing at a wishing well
They say only time will tell
Valet recognize the weed smell
Trouble Andrew did the jacket, check the details
My brother always wanna fight, I swear he means well
I bought the crib out in the Valley, now I'm eatin' well
TPC the mob, swear that we before the time
Push-to-start the truck, pink slip, this shit is mine
Murder everything I'm on and it's not a crime
Different gold, Ben Baller, yeah he did the chain
I still want some teeth, man, from Johnny Dang
And the white G-Wagon, cocaine

[Chorus]
I've been focused on my family and money (Money)
I pray to God and ask if Kenny watch over us
I've been working on my family and money
If you not busy, 20, promise you will call me
I've been focused on my family and money
I pray to God and ask if Kenny watch over us
I’ve been working on my family and money (Money)
If you not busy, 20, promise you will call me

[Verse 2]
All this money, it can’t fit inside the new safe
I'ma shower when I land, don’t need no suit case
All you lames take a seat
Turn it up, this a Hit-Boy beat
My life, not fair
Mansion, Montclair
We not from here
We not from here
Skrrt, skrrt, take the Lambo out
All these blogs write what Young 20 'bout
And my shorty from Atlanta, got a loud mouth
We make a movie when we pull up, what you talkin' 'bout?
Pick you up around 11:30 (Thirty)
I hope you is down to hit the town
I pray to God that they don’t ever cross us (Cross us)
I told my brother that it's time to boss up
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I've been focused on my family and money (Money)
I pray to God and ask if Kenny watch over us
I've been working on my family and money
If you not busy, 20, promise you will call me
I've been focused on my family and money
I pray to God and ask if Kenny watch over us
I've been working on my family and money (Money)
If you not busy, 20, promise you will call me
