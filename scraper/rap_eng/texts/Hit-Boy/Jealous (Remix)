[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I'm in my penthouse half naked, I cooked this meal for you naked, so where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass, don't make me break it
I wish that you were me, so you could feel this feeling, I never broke one promise
And I know when you're not honest, now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this"

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Queen B I'm tripping 'cause I'm a little insecure when your phone go off
'Cause they be calling at 3 in the morning, know I do the same shit but girl, it's different
And if I can, you can't fuck with no exes
You got me, no need for extras, you just love making me jealous
Hanging out with your girls all night and staying out 'til tomorrow
Girl, you got me all kinda crazy, sipping all on that bottle
I see you tryna flex, so mad I'm drunk texting
Now I'm reminiscing how we fell in love in Texas, girl, I'm jealous

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this"

[Bridge: Beyoncé & Chris Brown]
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous](5142635)
