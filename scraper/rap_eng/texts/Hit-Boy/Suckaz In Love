[Verse 1]
You could of said it all
Took the world and wrapped it up, and put it right up under my tree
Wouldn't have mattered to me, cause I
Threw away the only key, my hearts an empty case, and no one gets the best of me
But it's easier said than done
Cause now I, I'm, feelin like I caught the bug
Doin things I never done, if cupid's the one
Then I'm a shoot his arrow right back at him

[Chorus]
Cause I'm not tryna fall
No I'm not tryna fall like them suckaz in love
He's got my back against the wall (no I'm not tryna fall like them suckaz in love)
Fall like them suckaz in love

[Verse 2]
Never wrote a love letter
Til he took my breath away and made me feel like I couldn't speak (couldn't speak oh I)
Stealing kisses from the picture
Spending all day in the mirror, just in case we cross paths and meet
And I'm tryna fight it off
But there's something takin over me (feelin like I caught the bug)
Doing things I've never done, if cupids the one
Then I'm a shoot his arrow right back at him

[Chorus]
Cause I'm not tryna fall
No I'm not tryna fall like them suckaz in love
He's got my back against the wall (no I'm not tryna fall like them suckaz in love)
Fall like them suckaz in love

[Bridge]
But he's so sweet
And he tells me, all those things, that we could be
Should I give him some, we might have fun
But no not me, I'm not the one to fall, (fall for) for love
(See I ain't tryna fall like them suckaz in love)
Not the one to fall (fall for love, see I ain't tryna fall like them suckaz in love)
(Fall, fall for, see I ain't tryna fall like them suckaz in love)
(Fall, fall for, see I ain't tryna fall like them suckaz in love)
