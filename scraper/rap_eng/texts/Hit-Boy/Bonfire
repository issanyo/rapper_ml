[Verse 1: Oktane]
Ok you bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up, you bring the booze
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
To the hide out and think 'bout what we'll get high 'bout
I got my girl I blow her back out until the lights out
Ima marry that, gimmie that (inhales smoke)
I like my weed like my music, loud
Ladies always screamin when they choosin, ow
So if we gonna do this than lets do this right now
Cause the way the world moving we could all be going down
Just know that we're behind the steering wheel let's move it right
Peace and love smoke to that, who's got a light?
Puff it now pass it down laps around the room
They want me to rap about shooting like dying is cool
No colors, one race, that we're losing
We'll win tomorrow, move that table and bring those brews in
Tell your followers you bring 5 girls get 2 dudes in
Gotta keep the ratio, don't play this on the radio
These models check in for me now
It's sweats and flip flops, oh this one for the pretty girls
That fuck with hip hop or real rap music or whatever you wanna call it
You never get the bigger picture from inside the wallet
So stop chasing the bread, start chasing your dreams
Internet is the feds, molly got us like fiends
Only drugs that hurt us seem to be the only ones doctors prescribe
And everything that kills us makes us all feel alive

[Hook: Oktane]
So you bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up, you bring the booze
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
Cause you bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up, you bring the booze
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
To the bonfire

[Verse 2: Price]
I'm at the bonfire combing out my naps with a black pic
With a black fist vibing to some boom-bap shit
Pocket full of cash and carmax for these chapped lips
Telling stories about a black kid who loved to backflip
And rap with us cause we making booths out the mattress
Granny mad cause we recorded over all her classics
Stop the story reach into my jacket to grab some pre-rolls
Cause there's some cool people around me that I can match with
See some white skins, dark skins, mexicans
All unified by the vibes I came to represent
Fuck where you reside or your residence
You hesitant, rappers couldn't walk a mile in these shoes I'm steppin' in
Taking all challengers
Coming harder than Murphy Lee's "Welcome to Atlanta" verse
Ashes all on my flannel shirt
There's only one creator
And love is the religion
To your heart you must listen
Life is too short for divisions

[Hook: Price]
So you bring the weed, you bring the food
You call your girls, you bring the booze
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
One more time
I say you bring the weed, you bring the food
You call your girls, you bring the booze
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
To the bonfire

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Thump thump, okay, let him rap
Time to come together and connect the gap
Known as the bitch-snatching-bandit that always dressed in black
I think The Pack hit me like a brick I just woke up from an epic nap
Missed text about a party yea I'll probably go
Hit the lobby flow before I go, cup of coffee though
On good days the honda feel like a bugatti though
But the volumes low, hold on let me push this audio
Splendid, so now I'm headed to this shin-dig
Figure I'ma listen to this new shit that my friends did
Still the same homies ever since we all ascended
Siri interrupts the silence to say the trip has ended
Park and hop out as I wonder what could transpire
In the event of someone talking shit I'll pull my pants higher
But it's good vibes only homies 'round the campfire
Then my tribe marauders at midnight just like some vampires
You bring the weed, you bring the food
You call the girls up don't bring no dudes
We'll meet up at my spot and ride out and cruise
To the bonfire

[Interlude]
Get your vibe on, go on and on
Get your rhyme on, go on and on
Get your vibe on, go on and on
Get your rhyme on, go on and on
Get your vibe on, go on and on
Get your rhyme on, go on and on
Get your vibe on, go on and on
Get your rhyme on, go on and on
Get your vibe on, go on and on
Get your rhyme on, go on and on

[Cypher: Hit-Boy]
My pack louder than a cop siren
Thats why these police ass niggas wanna silence my squad
We came to save the game from drowning like a licenced life guard
Defying all odds took trips off of water and had hawaiian broads bop
Suckers pray that I stop and get off the ladder
Cause they know I got the tropicana
The juice no less than a jug full
I step in one leg at a time like a fucking jump suit
You sit back and watch the show from home like Hulu
I stay on my toes like a ballet, no tutu
Haters tryna dim Gang Starr rip Guru
But I've been doing this shit since FUBU
Girls sit in traffic during rush hour just to bring me mushu
I'm like a chemist in the stu just to make sure the feel ain't dead
Big homie said you can't loaf around all day and still make bread
Shit is changing
I had to reprogram my mind and make new living arrangements
Getting rid of self imposed immitations
Still practicing patience working on my cadence
Flow high Oktane like a service station
That boy nice feigning for that feeling of significance
But you can't enjoy the benefit if you can't accept the Price
I continue to push this audio
Is he better with the producing or lyrics?
They bumping heads with they questions like Super Mario
I'm repping throwing big dubs as I coast through Cali
Repping like Chilly Chill squabbling at the bowling alley
Repping like Kent M$ney passing me Gucci [?]
After I seen her at the Vibe in Riverside
I'm reppin the ill and I kept it alive
I'm reppin the ill and I keep it alive
I'm reppin the ill and I kept it alive
