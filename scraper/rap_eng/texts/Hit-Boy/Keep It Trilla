[Verse 1: Zay]
First off, we hustling, smuggling, young nigga tryna get filthy rich
I fell off for a second now I'm back with a vengeance
Tryna make 'em feel
Presence 'til they sick of it
Uh, Yeah I know you feeling this, young nigga known to spit trilla shit
Uh, Yeah I been killing shit, nigga name another that's real as this
My Puerto Rican call me papi, I swear that she be the baddest
My white girl
Call me daddy, I swear that her ass the fattest
She love to talk about it, swear that nothing gon' happen
Told her skip the
Conversation, cause I'm all about that action

[Hook: Zay]

Keep It Trilla, We Sipping That Drank & Rollin' Up Swishers
Keep It Trilla, Going hard in the paint they could never defend us
Keep It Trilla, Its MOB man fuck yo feelings
S5 we don't give a fuck, fuck

[Verse 2: Zay]

I'm on that G-shit, weed lit, Macking round with three chicks
Gang 6, that's my clique, your main girl's my side bitch
That fly shit, thought I told before, Finish my cup then I pour up some more
Cuffing ass niggas they stay patrol, fronting ass nigga just stick your role
How long we been gone for? We smoking on Lance Armstrong
And all these bitches down to blow, so we just call them time bombs
I'm on one, I'm logged on, what the fuck do a nigga got to try for?
Tell ASAP, Come fuck with ya boy, I'm a light skinned pretty flacko

I said she light skinned, she might win, my trust if she wanna show more skin
A she'll sin, cause she fuck with ya boy, So in but she fuck with my boy
Fuck that now she fuck with the man, Trust that your bitch in good hands
Love that, I'm stuck in a trance, Bottles go up with the blunt in my hand
I'm faded, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday bitch
Saturdays I don't remember Sundays are for church & shit
Woke up in a new Mustang from dreaming 'bout Bugatti's
Lit another, then I fuck her on some slow romantic Weeknd shit

[Hook: Zay]

[Verse 4: Zay]

Nigga tell me why I'm underrated & most hated
Like I don't seem to body everything I touch
I'm on the road to greatness, I been ya favorite
I got no patience I don't give a fuck
It's my turn, your gig is up, Rolling plenty blunts of that sticky stuff
These phony niggas they fake as fuck, Don't open your mouth if you finna front
Uh, bad bitches all off E, but I'm macking with my OG's
Middle finger if you tryna front on me
Bitch ass niggas, y'all could blow deez
Smile in my face, but they talk behind my back
Cause they know that's the only way we'll ever interact
And there is no debating I'm one of the best
And I bodied the track, Shit I'm making a mess

[Hook: Zay]

Keep It Trilla, We Sipping That Drank & Rollin' Up Swishers
Keep It Trilla, Going hard in the paint they could never defend us
Keep It Trilla, Its MOB man fuck yo feelings
S5 we don't give a fuck, fuck
