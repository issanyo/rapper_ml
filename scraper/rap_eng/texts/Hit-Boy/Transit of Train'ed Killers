{Zuri-Hysan’s Verse:}
99 Problems, 89 are solvable
10 are caskets, and then you got me
The sleigh ridin slayer, santa Z a OG
A sooth sayer say a super saiyan would get cold feet
Copeesh? Coldly empty shells at upholstery
From close D, clothes leak and homes be in no peace
With no D-Eagle just my shpeel, watch her yo
Cause she wants D, Siegel “Center” balls around her throat
Pro Player like a laker with this ocean flow, a boat will need a boat please
Spit like a body deporting groceries
Ima Protein(Pro-teen), getcha Keratin intake, If I snap at this Rate
I’ll kill your stats like Joakim Noah, carry my whole team over
Jahovah witnessed me testify to my murder of 21 Lives and thought “no lie”
Though this thick Crate of evidence in my lyrics state my claims as irrelevant
Still guilty of killin residents, evil has shown a presence
The pastor pronounce him RIP’ed
Now my pocket remove them presidents
Maximum charge I get like a gift card
Im gifted with this hard persona, cause a 10 Car pile up with bare arms
Say your Alms, your Palms need a Grip

{Archie the Bandit’s Verse:}
Well, let's flip the script, inscribe stitches in bitches lips
Roundhouse kick your organs an ignorant Chuck Norris
Spittin the chlorine, to erradicate all the boring
I'm sorry you ain't who they're adorin', honestly you left 'em snorin
I'll come and switch up the flow, windin' it up and watchin' it go
Rappers claim their craft is cold, but step to sway you'll meet pneumonia
Told ya, this fuckin' Archie kid is never a jokester
Ready to rumble watchin 'em tumble, down the fuckin totem pole
Back to the future with the go kart I've been Larkin in
Arsonin all the farces the rest are martyrs with Parkinson's
Weavin together my green dreams and I am still a teen
Ready to witness ears bleed, ready to kick it and smoke some tree
I'll advise you that my mind state is a fine tool
With proper use the words will fly over the heads of all these fools
Go and flick yo bic and rip the bong this shit'll hit you quick
And make you question existence or eat munchies with persistence
Lets get something straight, you think you fly huh? Well I'm the shit
Y'all just buzz around me houndin me trying to get a lick
How many licks does it take to get the center of my cock?
1-2-3? Hah bitch this ain't no tootsie pop
Oh sweetie you choke dead? The world may never know then
Breaking news dont bite off more than you can chew, choose wisely
-door number one or number two?
One is a deranged scene, and the other is the exact same thing (BANDIT!)

{Zuri-Hysan Verse:}
Watch I go back in and throw that
Like a Barfight, leave a toe tag, or two
Too trill and so mad that Im not shown where the Pros at
I shot G where yo girl at, like a Shotgun got a blow back
Opt out, never go back, then I pass that to my Pro-Zach

{Red Willy’s Verse:}
So you never heard me rap? You’re about to be surprised
So much in his head so how could he decide
Just what kinda nuisance to raise
I’ve written and given you all about two cents a day
It will lose you in looseleaf when you flip the page
So who’s he? A true beast loose from his cage
But the way I’ve been spittin for ya can’t be considered more
Than basic for my style while I’m dancing’ as the rhythm pours
With courage, I’ll assert that I am at least a little sure
I’m more versatile than stanzas on your kitchen floor
Wait. I’m getting too ahead of myself
I gotta slow it down and focus so to better my health
And butter bread so under cheddar, I am spreading the wealth
By grilling cheese until I see my intelligent self
PB and Jelly as well
All kinds of sandwiches, I’m gonna hand you this, some real ish I hope you feel it;
The city feels like home but home is somewhere that I’m not
Because the only homes I’ve ever known are homes where I get caught
Admittedly I’ve grown to be hopeful and to stop
Acting like the only way to learn is live it and be taught
I gotta seek the force, according to great Obi Wan
Before I’m in the quarry with stories from Lake Wobegon
I hope you cherish and feel it
That bar was from the heart, made in part by Garrison Keillor
See I’m just a funny guy taught to be
A student who knew that he should study biology
But distracted by rappin like I’m a young white prodigy
So here’s my lyrics, hear em with this stunning high quality
Believe it’s me in this rap you’re checkin
I’m eating MC’s like snacks for breakfast
Spitting, you choke and cough and grab your beverage
Hungry as a broken clock when I go back four seconds
I coulda used punch lines like every verse
But I wrote this shit in minutes and I never rehearsed
I wrote it so the homies could see what I have to donate
And I don’t even expect a check to show me reimbursed
I swear I feel the acid coming, sneaking up on me
The visits from the visuals will keep me company
Like kids after division and achieving custody
I’m eating Pe-king duck while I’m peaking and chuckling
Wanna see some real rap? Open up my notebook
But you can get a taste if you take a close look
At this one train I have been conducting
Laying out the tracks so fast cause rap to me is nothing

{Zuri-Hysan Verse}
Barely even conscious, My third eye wide open, radius at which I spoke is towards congress…

{Corwry’s Verse:}
You is no match fo the big bass
You throwbacks, my big bad
Dick could give you whiplash
And ya gonads gone get snatched
And slish-slashed, gift wrapped
Neva to be sewn back, that wish passed
So homie, cut the chit chat and grab a dish rag
And back off fo I snap jaw
Sniff a box of bath salts
Strip naked and dash through the walmart parkin lot like a mad dog
And start choppin cats with a hacksaw
And proceed to stomp em out on the asphault....is that all?
All of a sudden a dozen horde of cops
Rush in through the door buzzin "Cory stop!"
So I thought of somethin unorthodox and proceeded to jack off
Busted all over the bitch and her mormon pops
Pause. What a fat broad
Due to the way she shiver she timber when I deliver the mac sauce
Blue in the face these emcee quiver whenever we bitter rap brawl
For every cap that was cast on, and those who didn't catch on
Im ya fucking captain
Read between the caption
So, bleed or believe
We just be two different.....seeds of a breed
Genes seem to be seemed with speed and riddelin
Heebee geebee riddle em
Freezed to the Nth degree this entity beastly beat these brital men
It shoulda been pre-concieved that it'd be deemed a defeat to belittle him
Peewee simpletons
Retreat witcha tiny, demeaning, pre-teen, peepees gentlemen
Now make way for Regius Green
Masta-peace, Z-hysan, Senior P and hippie D, itchy
Eager to release the bombs

{Zuri-Hysan Verse:}
Licorice whips, no healin
A dark force who’ll extort your freedoms, if hes to catch the feelin
Often it leads to killin, as simple as Ice Cube chillin, a good day in itself
Let Nicholas go toe to toe and eat all other villains, indulge and delve

{Saint Nick’s Verse:}
Pass me the mic b
Because I just might be
A natural born killer, threat to all society
Stealthily unleashing this deceiving verbal wrath
So that violence laced with treason will not be the aftermath
And if it is then you better run home, PUNK
Better run home PUNK
Blasting at you chumps in a kill mode, DUCK
My homies dump’n I reload..then unload with lyrics/
Guaranteed to kill your entire spirit
When the reaper comes straight for your heart I hope that you won't fear itx2
Stay fearless…
Trapped in hell your body rots, demons steadily feast
Upon your soul its time to go the contention has deceased
Tragedies an calamities my emotions are released
Always living in misery,im suffering from a disease
Looking everywhere I see for something pure to set me free
Set me free, cop some tree, THC will tru-ly, safely put my mind at ease
Morals are what I believe, separate me, from all of the
Posers, imposters, the fakes, and the “in-crowd”
Who am I when nobody is around the same kind heart who wonders round the town
Who talks with a frown when he is put down
By all of his peers his family and himself
But still thank god I was blessed with good health
Amen!

{Zuri-Hysan Verse:}
Every rapper in the past was talking gun bang
Spoke slang just to show off how they run things
I would try to copy
Then decided that was dumb mayne
Put my team on this 1 train, like Im Rocky

{Hippy D’s Verse:}
Im a hippy from the south, FL to be exact
Always chillin with my homies smoking on a fat sack
Always smoking pot til the day that I die
The only time I stop, is when my mouths dry
Then I open my mouth and let the mountain dew flow
The cottonmouths gone and Im about ready to blow
Well rip up the bong cause I love blowin my dro
Learned from my mistakes never fall in love with a ho
Sometimes it’s hard but you gotta let go
Do whats best for you if your smart enough yo
Im just another normal human being on this planet dammit!
Hop off my nutsack its not a damn hammock!
I take your girlfriend like a bandit
No chloroform all I did was get straight naked
Momma always told me life is what you make it
Don’t hesitate to do shit and never fake it
Cause bein fake gets you nowhere in life
Nobody can trust you and always wants to fight, you
I can never understand
Doin shit like that makes you less of a Man
Than you ever could be, should be, wanna be and plus you can't see
That heart, honor, respect, and fami-ly
Is the most important to me, bi…-ooootch

{Zuri-Hysan Verse:}
Peace?sheesh, not involved
Peep the realest, call Peace
Please kill em all, Beastmode, never stall
Keep cutting these, let em suffer defeat
You get it?
Im finna decrease, your spirit
Ascend to the G, your finished!

{Masta-Peace’s Verse:}
Wake an bakin chasin with OJ an bacon this is greatness in the makin I just my tiiime with it get it then I griiind with it, split it, hit it then I dip it in a se-cond
So whatchu reckon I’m bout
Maybe blowin that loud, an getting wild
I’ll have you know this what I’m bout, an then I’m out
Never tethered I’d rather just roll around
Catch me kickin it back, that’s where it’s at
Getting mad hat, from a bad brat call this rat trap
Quick to buck an flirt ya bitch

Then shove ya in the trunk on some “mo’fuck a hearse” an shit
See you got flighty but then you got fried, slightly
Got ya kind upon my dinner table mofuckin night-ly
An though it might seem
I’m sellin bitches pipe dreams
Then cau-sin a fight scene
Cause I ain't got no Vi-sene
That’s simply standard for this ramb-lin gam-bler
Mo’fuckas getting crushed when I’m slammed off the handle
(PAUSE) Ready to roll, I’m ready to ride
(PAUSE) Ready to own, I’m ready to die
(PAUSE) Ready to go, I’m ready manage
I’m the realest one around come an getchu a sample

{Zuri-Hysan Verse:}
Floatin on a raft, with no assist
Growin on the mast of masters like bold cysts
The last thing I’ll say is Aye, if any day you come to VA
Don’t you ever,ever,ever,ever,ever,ever,ever Come at Sway

{Pierce Love’s Verse:}
