[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Top floor, top floor
Dom in the back [?]
We got something on the line
Yeah, lil' bitch

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
When I think of you, I think of wedding chapels
Sweet like a Mangrove Snapper
Pink lemonade on my wrist and it drip
I bet the whole thang and we damn take the risk
Caught up in the game, doing this for years
She gon' just get loose, cause she feelin' him
Just got off a phone call with Eminem
He told me I could tell you never force none of your hits
Whole time in my head, I'm thinking hope they free Big Hit
I just sent your bitch, now she been [?]
Never seen it cause it's custom, though
Cocaine paint bussin' on them hundred spokes
Presidential suite and we still treat it like the mall
BC brought the pack, I got a duffel full of dough
Retch is on the roll, [?] to Joe Moses
She like my backstroke
Put it in the song
Come and be my girlfriend, for one night
We on the top floor with it, yeah

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
Top floor, top floor
We on the top floor with it

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
If I'm guilty, it's from sticking to the script
I'm from where so many of 'em came and win
Don't lock her up, she wanna live
Don't lock her up, she wanna live
I be in the lofts with the view or the strip
Don't really like to waste nothing, roll it thin
I stopped talking to her for rocking the MCM
Got standards to uphold, baby who'd you think I am
Let you see the Spanish bungalow
Have some cute homegirls, I ain't hit none of those
We in the steam-room, living life like shit
I know her, all she wanna do is be my main chick
You never seen it cause it's custom, though
And no mad wagon on them hundred spokes
Blue c-notes, we get a tone of those
[?] the ATM, til all the money gone
Top floor
