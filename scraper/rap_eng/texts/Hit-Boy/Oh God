Sweet love of mine, I miss you
And every time I think of you
I get this mind to touch you
I start to cry and then it’s fuck you
Because you, you left me with these tears, baby
And gave me all these fears, baby
I don’t know how I’ll live, baby
Cause I miss you, yeah I miss you
And this is how I feel, lady
Real nigga shit, I’m real baby
And if you didn’t know

[Hook]
In my mind
You belong to me, whoa
You belong to me
In my mind, darling can’t you see
We were made to be
You belong to me
I said I miss your love like this
I said miss your love like that
I wish you bring that thing right back
I wish you'd bring that thing right back
I said I miss your love like this
I said miss your love like that
I want you bring that thing right back
I wish you'd bring that thing right back
Oh god

[Hit-Boy]
Damn, you stand on the same shit like a synonym
You know, wearing the latest Phillip Lim
Now you wanna sit with him
Got me on the flicker bench
Thinkin' 'bout the last minute flights to shop in Switzerland
Coppin' kicks and shit, high heels
To stunt on hoes hatin' that I loved you so much
I had to juxtapose
Tryin' to understand your position
Wish they had a prescription
Finally see that sad is a sickness
In that black 550 in the cut
Listenin' to that nigga who used to be signed to Puff
You know, I wish I never met her, at all
I ain’t Usher, I am waitin' on that call
Shit be feelin' like traffic on the weekend now, fucked up
Cause I’d rather just sleep in now
Love struck and I’m fallin' off the deep end now
Hennessy, whiskey, and tears
You might see me drown, fuck it

[Hook]

Carry on, act like it don't phase you
I know you’ll be back one day soon
And I’ll be okay, boo
Cause soon I’ll be a bit more stable
And I’ll be okay too
And I won’t need you
I won’t seek your love
Think about the ways we fucked
We're missing all that trust
Damn girl, why would you leave
Tell me baby, how could you go
When I needed you so, I
I needed you so
I'm out of white lines
Yeah baby, I’m out of control
I’m blowed out my mind

[Hook]
