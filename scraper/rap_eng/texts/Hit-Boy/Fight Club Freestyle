[Intro: Murder Z, EveryDay Rapper]
Shout Out to Monty, Keyvon, Brennen, Ethan, A$AP, Zyeir, Adobee, the whole group

Yo kick that shit Sean!

[Verse 1: Murder Z]
I'll do a drive-by on a tricicle
Got your girl on my nuts for 1 nickel
Kill a Communist with a hammer and a sickle
Uh
I'm crazy, a skitzo, a wack job
Cut your head off with a hacksaw
Body slam you on the asphalt
Leave your ugly ass with a cracked jaw
Yea i'm straight up penthouse livin
Smacked 6 bitches for trippin
Too much East-coast dick-lickin
But fuck it, i am the sickest
YAWK YAWK!

Kill that shit E!

[Verse 2: Everyday Rapper]
When i'm on the stage, yeah i shine bright
I be picking it up, like it's fight night
Yo, you can see me on the stage
I be crazy, like a road rage
Nobody wants to save me
Because i'm fucking crazy
I'll slap a bitch in a minute
If you're in it to win it
I have nothing to say
Just remember this by the day
My rapper name is EveryDay
So just say your stage
And just shine and fade away
I'm bout to slay your legs away
Then i'll cut your neck with a razor blade
You ain't nothing to me
So get your bitch ass and watch a movie

[Verse 3: Amadeus The Great]

I'll roll a doobie, i'll roll a blunt
I blunt raps with these blunts
I hit you front
In the face, and just incase
You don't remember
Your chick said my dick was quite tender
Like a tender steak
All you niggas fake
You sound like Drake
I can take
A whole minute
To take this track and spin it
In a web, Charlotte's Web
What i said
Can be written, i'm shittin, I'm spittin
On your shoes, What can i do?
I can do anything! what can i say?
You're a faggot, it means you're fucking gay!
You're a dike, you ride a bycicle
You're booty tickled, this fuckin' sickle
Can get sticked in your head
Listen to what i said, listen to what i said!
Yup, you're hella bent, when i represent
Have you dent
In the mouth, have you goin south
Gonna suck a dick, on your knees saying please
You can put it in your mouth and say cheese
You bitch niggas, you witch niggas, you quick niggas
You slow niggas, you don't make no dough nigga
Now shout it all, you can suck on my balls we hella tall
6-foot, 7-foot, 8-foot 9
When i rhyme, i put a nine clip up to your head
And then you be marking everything i fucking said
I be poppin lead
Up into your house
It's a drive-by, why would i lie? i'm a nice guy
But i fight like, i'm in the fight club
Rule number 1, don't talk about fight club, you fuck-fuck!
You can suck nuts, or suck 2
Testes in your mouth like a test tube
I won't test you
I'll let you live if i get
The life from you i take it i fuckin say it
I fuckin spray it
This is the best shit, it's Amadeus
