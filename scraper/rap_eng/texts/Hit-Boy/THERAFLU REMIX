[Verse 1]
Flow cold need sweater like winter
I don't fuck with you niggas like Hitler
Short-shorts, round curves, I kinda dig her
Suck my dick til her motherfuckin lips hurt
Head swerves til my mo fuckin head burst, like Cobain tryna keep sane, don't work
You see, i'm Kira the killer with all the verses
Write shit down, put you niggas in the hearses
Dirty Bunch back like a dad hat on a white boy who joining a frat pack
Half black, think white, act niggerish
Actually smart but I...act ignorant
Bitch put the ass back in plastic
Say that, bitch get mad like Jurassic
When i'm on the beat I go spastic
Write rhymes down with the eyes of an addict
Casey Anthony, make beats, kill it
Niggas get cooked like a mo fuckin skillet
You'll all fall off like Scrillex
And ya awful,  you niggas soft, none you niggas wit it
Leaf hurricane, stay spinnin'
Rock Lee, KO, nigga you finished
I'ma go ham like piglet, put you rap niggas in the ground like diglett
