[Refrain]
Life moving too fast, hit the brake lights
I hit two bitches in the same night
Got 'em different hotels but the same flight
Man this shit just ain't right

[Verse]
But it feel good
Yea I made it out the bottom but I'm still hood
Gotta show all of my niggas that they still could
If they grinded 'til the daylight, we could all live the same

[Refrain]

[Verse]
Remember when I couldn't picture this here
Now I'm feeling just a bit richer this year
Closer to my dreams, still living in fear
The only nigga that get it is the man in the mirror

[Refrain]

[Verse]
When my fam out here starving
Getting all of these texts while I'm car shopping
Goddamn feel like my heart stopping
Where the doctor, I should go heart shopping

[Refrain]

[Verse]
None of these niggas in the shoes I'm in
I try to hide the pain but I can't pretend
Family don't comprehend 'bout the game I'm in
When did I start resembling an ATM?

[Refrain]

[Verse]
Suddenly I don't know who to trust
Bitches be in a rush to try to say it's love
Steady looking for a nigga to cherish
She probably only here cause "Niggas in Paris"

[Refrain]

[Verse]
My own thoughts fucking me over, I'm just lucky I'm sober
The game'll try to push you, off the ledge in your Rover
Run you off of the shoulder
They try to Earnhardt you quick but I'm closer to Gordon
I'm rolling

[Refrain]

[Verse]
I'm on my knees praying with my eyes wet
They jab and I side step
Buying bottles, ain't paid my tithes yet
But still I disguise it, questioning my worth
Tell me how I'm s'posed to feel when I grew up in a church
And I'm staying me
I do this shit for my mama, ?, and Kaley, still these niggas hate me
But whether or not they get the vision or feel the life that I'm living
I'm getting riches from not even having a pot to piss in
But still these niggas is shaking my hand and act like they wishing me the best but hit the streets and they start subliminal dissing
Fuck 'em, believe it
Better yet, love 'em, cause they need it

[Refrain]
Life moving too fast, hit the brake lights
I hit two bitches in the same night
Got 'em different hotels but the same flight
Man this shit just ain't right
Man this shit just ain't right
I swear this shit just ain't right

[Outro x4]
Slow down, slow down, slow down
Slow down, slow down, slow down
Brake lights, brake lights, brake lights
