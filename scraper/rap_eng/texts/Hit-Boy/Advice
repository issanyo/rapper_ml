[Verse 1]
I'm just tryna get with you
Tell me if it's possible
Four years from 32
But I could do a lot for you
Just turned 21
Young nigga doing things
See you making moves too
But shawty move, move my way
We been going back and forth
She know that I want that ass for certain
Tell me she'll be back for more and more
Lemme put you on a different wave
You ain't gotta worry bout my a-age

[Verse 2]
Maybe young don't know why you tripping
Know you wanna ride, know you wanna feel some different
Why you wanna front like I ain't got your attention?
I tried to tell you but you won't listen
Now I'm who you calling for
Gave you what you need, now you can't ignore it
You're lit, lit and it shows for sure
Now I got you on a different wave
Age ain't really shit these days

Good weed, roll it up
Bad bitch, pulling up

Tell me if it's possible
Four years from 32
But I could do a lot for you
Just turned 21
Young nigga doing things
See you making moves too
Shawty won't you move my way

Give you good dick and advice (x2)
