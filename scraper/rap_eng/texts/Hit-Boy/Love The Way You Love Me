[Intro: Nicole Scherzinger]
La, la, la, la...
La, la, la, la...

[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
Mister invisible, tell me how did I miss you, boy
How could you have never caught my eye
Were you there all along, or were you just shy?
Mister I never noticed you, tell me that you ain't got a girl at home
See you're a catch, I wanna snatch you up
I know that I slept on you, now I woke up

[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger & (Jessica Sutta)]
(Boy, how did I miss that smile, your style, your game, juicy)
If you lick your lips one more time
Boy, you about to have it

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
'Cause I like it smooth like that, you're cool like that
Must be good like that, I can tell by that
I'm gonna love the way you love me
I'm gonna love the way you love me
Starin' at you too like that, ooh like that
What it do like that, how you do all that
I'm gonna love the way you love me
You're gonna love the way you love me

[Post-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
La, la, la, la...
(La, la, la, la)

[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger & (Melody Thornton)]
So come with me and walk for awhile
Can I spring you outta here and talk for awhile
Gotta know what's the deal with you
Mister now I'm really feeling you
'Cause I even like the way you sip your drink
Just enough ice on you to make me think
What I gotta do for you to scoop me up
And what I gotta say to be the one you touch (You touch)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger & (Jessica Sutta)]
(Boy, how did I miss that smile, your style, your game, juicy)
If you got a little extra time
Then won't you let me have it, yeah

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
'Cause I like it smooth like that, you're cool like that
Must be good like that, I can tell by that
I'm gonna love the way you love me
I'm gonna love the way you love me
Starin' at you too like that, ooh like that
What it do like that, how you do all that
I'm gonna love the way you love me
You're gonna love the way you love me

[Bridge: Melody Thornton]
I like how your T-shirt cut you right
And how you melt me deep inside
Oh, you're running in a different league
Don't make me chase you, boy, you know I'm game
By the way you're rockin' it in them Nike's
Won't you let me play on your team tonight?
We can go one-on-one, you and me
That's the way that it should be, yeah

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
'Cause I like it smooth like that, you're cool like that
Must be good like that, I can tell by that
I'm gonna love the way you love me
I'm gonna love the way you love me
Starin' at you too like that, ooh like that
What it do l√Øke that, how you do all that
I'm gonna love the way you love me
You're gonna love the way you love me, baby

[Outro: The Pussycat Dolls]
Oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, baby
