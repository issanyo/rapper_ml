[Intro]
Uh, Martin had a dream/
Kendrick have a dream/
Yeah we got the same thing/
Look/

[Hook]
All my life I want money and power/
Respect my mind or die from led shower/
I'm talking bout the led that be living inside this pencil/
Watch me bring this track alive as I'm killing this instrumental/

[Verse 1]
Cause I'm Prime Time you sideline, I'm in THE game like EA/
I been putting down track every day since the age of quince/
Tell ya boys to ease up like Ving Rhames on replay/
Cause my waistband got 2 heat like King James and D. Wade/
AW, keep a sick mind like I got a head of lice/
With my back against the odds like I'm laying on a bed of spikes/
You sipping natty ice, while I'm sipping holy water/
Holy father my money's godly call it the bread of Christ/
(cause)

[Hook]
All my life I want money and power/
Respect my mind or die from led shower/
I'm talking bout the led that be living inside this pencil/
Watch me bring this track alive as I'm killing this instrumental/

[Bridge]
Good god I feel amazing, God I feel amazing/
God answered my calls, he stalled but I was patient/
All my life I want money and power/
Respect my mind or die from led shower/

[Verse 2]
I got 25 women on my waistline/
Never took a break but I got 50 worth of dimes cause I take 5/
I stay fly and heard through the grape vine/
I'm looking like money and if time is money I guess you'd call me FaceTime/
You stalling, I go all in, yo retail be falling/
I'm Balling, like Spaulding, these females be calling/
But you know what I do about that, and if you don't know check iTunes/
And if you're tryna get to where I'm at, you better take notes on my moves/
(cause)

[Hook]
All my life I want money and power/

Watch me bring this track alive as I'm killing this instrumental/

[Bridge]
Good god I feel amazing, God I feel amazing/
God answered my calls, he stalled but I was patient/
All my life I want money and power/
Respect my mind or feel the wrath of these rhymes/

[Verse 3]
Coming at 9 times the original pace, Einstein on a pinnacle chase/
You struggle to carry your minimum weight while I carry my weight like I'm living in space/
And I'm feeling so great I think-hold up
And I'm feeling so great I think-hold up/
And I'm feeling so great I think-hold up
Feeling so great I think I'mma take over/
Watch as I kill off and body my enemies
Ride on my enemies, shot em like Kennedy/
Shot of the Hennessy, probably a friend of me
But I believe to put God over anything/
Ah, and I still feel like the best, right?
Kinda like taking 3 lefts, right?/
You begging to differ and think that your better
Precede to go put up your best, fight/
Hop in the ring go toe for toe and go round for round as I summon the heat/
Hop in the ring go blow for blow and go pound for pound as you suffer defeat/
Women are willing to bust it for me, bust till I'm weak and I come to my peak/
It's safe to say that I'm here to stay cause everyone is a custom to me, yeah!/

[Hook]
All my life I want money and power/
Respect my mind or die from led shower/
I'm talking bout the led that be living inside this pencil/
Watch me bring this track alive and I'm killing this instrumental/

[Bridge]
Good god I feel amazing, God I feel amazing/
God answered my calls, he stalled but I was patient/
All my life I want money and power/
Respect my mind or die from led shower/

Keep that one

[Outro]
Martin had a dream/
Kendrick have a dream/
Yeah we got the same thing/
Yeah/
