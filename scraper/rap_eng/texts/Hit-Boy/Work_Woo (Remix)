[Work (Reprod. By King Libra)]
Verse 1
I hope when you hear this
You smile
Cause you know I mean this
It's been awhile since I seen you
Heard you just got out a relationship
Girl is that true?
Yeah I changed a little but not a lot
Ooo and I see you girl my gosh
Claimed you're title now you on top
Young African American girl
Got caught up in the world
Would've been fine
Just being mine
Together stuck in los Orlando Vegas
Yeah Shawty you know I'm what I'm saying
Take you Ddh I been down
Girl you still love that's the way it sounds
When you going figure out you need someone
And by someone I mean me
And when I'm gone don't worry just pick up you're phone
My flow sound like poetic justice
Yeah poetic my justice
Got so new to life you living
But Damn girl I couldn't adjust it
I mean I might hit Shawty with my poetic predicate
Matter fact she going get this long sentence
Get it
Yo long hair
And you're soft skin
And ya body looking so damn delicious
Wit that big ass I can't tame it
Ooo
Girl do you that's what I love about you
You probably don't care about me
I just wish we would've fought less
And fucked more
They did say communication save relations
So baby how bout me nd you get away and have a vacation
Hate to see you go girl I couldn't take it
That's why I do these songs so you know I'm still around
P.S
Where you at girl I just made it back it in town
Bubble gum lipstick
Girl who you been kissing
Yeah I know what ya boys like
Baggy pants and his cuff tights
Hey that's what you like right
You up on the phone late night
Dress half naked
Sent you a text guess it ain't make it
Wrong
Turned you're over
Like I wouldn't notice

And I hate how the hoes
Blow a nigga phone like they ain't see even young nigga (Workin)
Yeah I'm on the snap
Getting play all day
But if I ain't respond

Wish I had two damn phones
Like Kevin Gates
Guess I gotta put the (work in)
I'm come around and chop shit
Let the AK spray like 8k
Li nigga I put the (work in)
Dirt dirt dirt dirt
Take your girl home
Best believe Shawty

And if you see me some with damn earphones
Don't talk to a nigga

Oh nah nah nah

Verse 3
I get to the commas lil mama
Flow lyrics make you scream and holla
And ya body make me wanna throw a couple dollars
Huh
Shawty it's obvious
That you got some problems
But we all got some issues
I ain't saying i’m here to fix you
Cause my man’s J. Cole said
Don't save her if she don't wanna be saved
Tired thinking I can be your saviour
These girls making me so anxious
