[Verse 1]
I Live In The World
Where The Haters Talk Shit About You
If You Get Money
Man That Shit Is Ugly
I Found A Few Connects
When I Was Young
Selling Dope Was Never Easy
Man I'm Telling You, I Got Lucky
I Was Up On Alameda
Cruisin' Down The Street
Usually A Pretty Bitch
Up On My Driver Seat
Inhale Exhale
I Hate It When You Lie To Kick It
Bitches Need To Keep It Real
I Give A Fuck How You Feel
I Got Some Dope Money
Then I Went & Paid My Momma's Bills
Notorious Smoked With The Gang
Spit Flows & I Never Say No To A Fade
Zip-Lock Bags Full Of Dro & Some Caine
In My Zone All I Do Is Put Doe In The Bank
Hoes Better Know What I Smoke & I Drank
Extendos & A Half A "O" On The Tray, Lets Roll

[Hook]
Bitches Got My Name Tattoo'd On Em
Thinking That They Got Me On Lock (Never!)
I'm At A Party With A Couple Of Goons
And I'm Hoping That Nobody Get Shot (Get It)
No Party Like A Gangsta Party
No Party Like A Gangsta
No Party Like A Gangsta Party
Ain't No Party Like A Gangsta

[Verse 2]
I Come From The Gang
Yeah I Come From The Streets
Yeah I Still Get Harassed By The Fucking Police
You Still On The Run
And You Still Getting Guns
You Livin' Like Fuck It
I'm Still Sellin' Drugs
Don't Understand What I Gotta Do
To Make You Understand
All I Had Was A Couple Soups
I Grew Up Kinda Screwed Up
Started Getting Tatted
Everything About Me Blew'd Up
Listening To Wu-Tang, Cash Rules
Money Over Hoes
Even If She Got Me Tattoo'd
Came Back In A All Black Benz's
Its A Trip How I Went
And I Lost A Few Friends
The Evil Amongst A Few Men
I Lost A Few Hoes I Was With
Fuck Em I'm Still Gettin' Bread
I'm Still Gettin' Way Up Ahead
I'mma Fuck With Your Best Friend Instead
You Still Being Watched By The Feds

[Hook]
