[Verse 1]
I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling that's because I'm jealous

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"

[Verse 2]
Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
Yoncé fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy you been hanging out at night
Tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables ain't got no cares, no sorrow
I ran into my ex
Said what up to his besties
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas
Don't be jealous

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no"

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
