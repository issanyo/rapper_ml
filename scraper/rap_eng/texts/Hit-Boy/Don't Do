[Intro]
If you don't know my name..
You'll learn it
I'm bringing some information, I'm here to teach you
Feel like I'm chilling in pre-school, taught y'all to "Ske-ew"

[Verse 1]
Y’all acting like I couldn’t see you, wait til this reach you
Talking shit about me? Please dude, y’all need a redo
Y’all need to learn some manners, he knew, there’s nothing E do
That doesn’t pop the fucking speakers, I didn’t mean to
Ah shit, maybe I did
Maybe I tried to, only a bit
Maybe you’d like to claim that I fib
Baby I’d like to hand you a bib
Quit drooling you fool, I’m cooling
With the respect that I’ve earned off of music
I see you’re jealous, do not confuse it
I am just lyrical see how I use it, abuse it
Oh and did I mention I didn't attend detention
I got so many bullets that travel straight through your henchmen
And directly into your ear, when you hear this living legend
It’s as if you’re feeling claws coming up from right where the bed end
I’m a nightmare, I fight fear
With words lighting like a lighter
Did I write? Yeah, yo it’s right there
Right next to all the things that you’d like to hear
I just can’t tell if you’ll fight or not
People say you might be surprised or shocked, but
I don’t really care how they’re rattling on
When I have like 50-fucking-thousand songs
I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
I just keep writing, lighting shit up like lightning
Y’all want me to get to fighting, but everyone takes a liken to Me like you
They don’t see the struggles every day that E go through
He don’t do what anybody tells him, difficult
I just keep writing, I just see from the right end
You say you see the left, but left me thinking that shit might end
Up being something frightening
Like ten thousand titans
I go in like my low end theory
I just had to show it, really

[Chorus]
My name is Ethan Harrington, I’m here to show you
There’s many things I do that you don’t do, though you’re supposed to
My name is Ethan Harrington, I’m here to show you
The reason I’m collecting winnings: nothing that I don’t do

[Verse 2]
Do whatever floats your boat
But between money and hoes, go for the dough
If she wants yours, go for the door
And if she wants more, no baby no
Don’t make me get Ye and Jamie in here
Girls come to me, secretly “Pay me!” appears
Right over their head, I can see it clear, bitch
You want me dead, but you want new earrings it’s
So disgusting, I’m poor as fuck and
These bitches want me and ask to suck it
I’m like fuck it, that shit just shows me
I’ll cause a ruckus and get some shows see
I see shit y’all couldn't see with reading
Glasses, blasting on the phone asking
For a better prescription, you bitches been wishing
Digging through your talents, trying to do this shit
But this is what’ll flip your misses
Around to me, trying to do my dishes
Listen bitch, you can do my dishes
But I ain’t no genie, I ain’t granting wishes
You ain’t part of the mission
You just want some kids and
A life in L.A. like your parents didn’t
You can see the vision, only because
I’ve made it clear like the glass you’re rinsing

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Third verse, should I make it the worst?
I mean it’s the best, but the worst for you herbs
The way I string together all of these words
I’m loading other poets up in a hearse
I’m looking for more instrumentals to murder them
He a famous rapper? I haven’t heard of him
Name a single person that I ain’t heard from
About how good I am with all of these words
I’m a genius with my craft, a Leonardo
But I learned it from my past to become tomorrow
I found out I’m Rondo, or Jordan, or James
Found out I’m better than most in this game
Found out I’m running for glory and fame
They say that I’m coming for monetary gains
You see that I make this on purpose
And don’t sacrifice any wording
To make it sound perfect
Cause boy if I wanted I’d make it, I’m honest
On every track like when Ethan come on it
I’m murdering everybody
Like I’m sent from hell, but I’m heaven see buddy
I run it
Like I’m on the verge of accomplishment
Nah I’ll stop that shit, but don’t knock the shit
Hear this song and start rocking it’s
The fucking Melrose conglomerate

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I just keep writing, lighting shit up like lightning
Y’all want me to get to fighting, but everyone takes a liken to Me like you
They don’t see the struggles every day that E go through
He don’t do what anybody tells him, difficult
I just keep writing, I just see from the right end
You say you see the left, but left me thinking that shit might end
Up being something frightening
Like ten thousand titans
I go in, had to show it, feel me?
You’re listening to the real E
