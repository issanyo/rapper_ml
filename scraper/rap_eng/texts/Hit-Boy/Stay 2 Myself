[Intro]
24hrs
Fifty for the, beep

[Chorus]
Bigger, finer, things
VVS rings
I stay to myself
Y'all turned y'all back, didn't wanna help, yeah
Can't trust no hoes, yeah
They might run off with your heart, yeah
Don't trust no niggas, yeah
Baby girl, I know you smart
Bigger, finer things (Finer things)
VVS rings

[Verse 1]
Ooh, they say, "20, you the hardest," yeah
I run circles round' these artists
My name 20, ask your bitch about me
My chain real, ask Ben Baller 'bout me
I'm to myself, you don't got ever shout me, shh
I keep it solid, ask Hit-Boy about me
All we did was pray to God
Tokyo already beat the odds

[Chorus]
Bigger, finer, things
VVS rings
I stay to myself
Y'all turned y'all back, didn't wanna help, yeah
Can't trust no hoes, yeah
They might run off with your heart, yeah
Don't trust no niggas, yeah
Baby girl, I know you smart
Bigger, finer things (Finer things)
VVS rings

[Verse 2]
Pay attention
Ooh, y'all see the kid stuntin'
My cuzzo did a ten and he ain't did nothing
The world was sleep
RIP to Fredo and Lil Peep, yeah
Angels watch me grow
Was looking through my pics with Shawty Lo
Legends live forever, I was smart
Yeah, Hit-Boy sleeping on the charts

[Chorus]
Bigger, finer, things
VVS rings
I stay to myself
Y'all turned y'all back, didn't wanna help, yeah
Can't trust no hoes, yeah
They might run off with your heart, yeah
Don't trust no niggas, yeah
Baby girl, I know you smart
Bigger, finer things (Finer things)
VVS rings
