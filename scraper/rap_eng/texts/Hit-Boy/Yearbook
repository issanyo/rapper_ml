Seems like yesterday we were hanging in the hallway
Waiting for the bell to ring then walk into class late
We had no intentions on paying any attention
Throughing notes across the room, end up in detention
Hiding from the teachers up under the bleachers
First make out experiece, before I got experience
Someone's student council, while others fought in bathrooms
Oh what I give to go back to the past, as I...

Flipping through my yearbook pages
Thinkin' it's crazy how everything changes
Silly things we used to do, I still remember how it was
'Cause those days were the greatest
Flipping through my yearbook pages
Thinkin' it's a shame that everbody changes
Wish everyone I knew could stay the same just like they were
'Cause, change is overrated

It's four or five years later, I'm home, Christmas vacation
Ran into Michelle, head cheerleader, she's three months pregnant
Said our high school quarterback got paralyzed in an accident
He was on his way to the NFL
Whatever happened to Alvala, Victoria and heard she
Had a breakdown, fall semester second year
I hope she pulls it together and I wish I could help a friend
I wish I could reverse the hands of time, go back again

Flipping through my yearbook pages
Thinkin' it's crazy how everything changes
Silly things we used to do, I still remember how it was
'Cause those days were the greatest
Flipping through my yearbook pages
Thinkin' it's a shame that everbody changes
Wish everyone I knew could stay the same just like they were
'Cause, change is overrated

Flipping through my yearbook pages
Thinkin' it's crazy how everything changes
Silly things we used to do, I still remember how it was
'Cause those days were the greatest

Oh, thinking back to my past, I wouldn't change a thing
I probably do everything exactly the same
Getting the opportunity to live it over again
I would cherish every moment oh

Back in the days, when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days, when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Flipping through my yearbook pages
Thinkin' it's crazy how everything changes
Silly things we used to do, I still remember how it was
'Cause those days were the greatest
Flipping through my yearbook pages
Thinkin' it's a shame that everbody changes
Wish everyone I knew could stay the same just like they were
'Cause, change is overrated

Change is overrated, don't feel the same and
If I could go back, I'd probably do it all the same
Woo waah ooh ooh waah oh uhh ooh waah oh
Change is overrated, don't feel the same and
If I could go back again, I'd do it all the same
Woo waah ooh ooh waah oh uhh ooh waah oh
