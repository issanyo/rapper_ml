[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Show me something
Show me, show me something
Show me, show me something
Show me something
Show me, show me something
Show me something

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Bake bread, break bread or fake dead
Real life since Lake Ave., right next to the Payless
I roll dice, I don't stop, I'm 'bout to go make me a go sign
I like ghetto girls with gel in their weave who go to Sally's to get their pro style
Watch a pro pile paper, like a desk in the office
I was on my second Lexus by the time I met Tiara
I'm talkin' 18, I had the biggest booty girl in the city wanna get married
I cracked her orderin' a 3 piece at KFC on Baseline and Cherry
Freak hoes came next, E-40 just texted me
They said, "Boy you be snappin' harder than the quote unquote rappers"
I bout that BM, had to matte it
You gotta watch the way that the color coat
I was coppin' shit I didn't come up on
So my next whip gon' have a hundred spokes
And I never lie, I'm under oath
Her drawers to the side, gutter bowl
Me, you, we ain't even comin' close
I see you, I see a fuckin' hoax
This the year I'm goin' new on you hoes
In the old school, pushin' up the oaks
With pre-rolls in my bubble coat
Only bangin' music, I produce and wrote
So before your mouth get to runnin'
You gon' have to show me somethin'
Shoulder rubbin' niggas who don't get it on their own
Say the most but they ain't sayin' nothin'
Payin' double's what you will do
I need to pool that looks like Uncle Phil pool
I need some banners in the venue
Nigga it don't matter what you've been through
You gotta show me somethin'

[Hook: Hit-Boy] x2
Show me, show me somethin'
Show me somethin'
Show me, show me somethin'
Show me somethin'
I've seen it all, I heard it all
I won't even listen to the talk, no I'm not involved
You gon' have to show me

[Verse 2: B. Carr]
Stackin' cash, hustlin', nigga gettin' his money up
Poured off with this double cup, half a bar and a couple blunts
I'm zonin' boy, no ATL, head spinnin' 'round like a vogue wheel
I'm so high, I'm too drilled off 4 lines and a ginger ale
Can barely walk, I'm on stand still, phone ringin', boy I keep goin' dumb
Can't feel my body, my shit's numb, RIP to my lil' bruh
[?], had to let you know that a nigga really out in the field
Call the plays, no 4th down, can't wait for it to touchdown
I'ma tell you niggas now I ain't doin' this shit for no centerfold
Cause it's plenty nights I ain't trip on pussy, but a nigga still fall into hoes
Fuck her good then end it fast, ain't nothin' interferin' with this cash
Bank teller, oh bank teller can I get everything in blue bands?
Niggas still lames though, whole circle red like Japan's flag
G, my hater, my pants sag, mama hate it I sold bags
Lifestyle of a thug nigga, quick to tell a nigga run it, run it
Tell a bitch she wanna fuck with me, she gon' have to be more than ordinary, girl

[Hook: Hit-Boy]

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
This isn't my (nigga we've been on) first time here
This isn't my (nigga we've been on) first time here
This isn't my (nigga we've been on) first time, oh no
This isn't my (nigga we've been on) first time here
Yeah that sounds like a plan
(What you gon' grow up to be?) To be the mothafuckin' man
Yeah that sounds like a plan
(What you gon' grow up to be?) I'ma be the mothafuckin' man
Yeah that sounds like a plan
(What you gon' grow up to be?) To be the mothafuckin' man
Yeah that sounds like a plan
(What you gon' grow up to be?) I became the mothafuckin' man

[Verse 3: Hit-Boy]
Wasn't no gas in that Volvo, that's why I'm gassed up now
But I was that when I used to play with the yo-yo at my grandma's house
She had it jumpin' like pogo, right off Meringo
Fast forward to 2011, I did my first radio single
My nigga Ricky made a play with his cousin, all I had to do was cook
Flew out to work on Watch the Throne, felt like I had to sign to G.O.O.D
I didn't know I was this good, just a young nigga from the hood
Made to feel less than what I'm worth, but you won't hit me with the juug
No you won't hit me with the juug, you won't hit me with the juug
No you won't hit me with the juug, you won't hit me with the juug
