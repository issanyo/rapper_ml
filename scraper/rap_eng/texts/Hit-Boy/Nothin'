[Hook : B Mac]
I took your girlfriend like it was nothin' (Like it was nothin')
She fell in love but I ain't for nothin' (I ain't for nothin')
She wanna call me I answer nothin' (I answer nothin')
I swear to God man that shit was nothin' (That shit was nothin')
I'm out here ballin' like it's just nothin' (Like it's just nothin')
I fuck her once and I never cuffin' (Like it was nothin')
She wanna call me I answer nothin' (I answer nothin')
I swear to God man that shit was nothin' (That shit was nothin')


[Verse 1 : Oktane]
Yeah, uhhh
I came in 30 deep like it was nothin' (Like it's just nothin')
I know you heard of me act like it nothin' (Like it's just nothin')
I hit her sister then I hit her cousin (Like it's just nothin')
It's HS87 right now we bossin' (Like it's just nothin')
Alright I need this party slow-mo
You hatin' baby that's promo
She said "Oktane you that nigga"
Girl tell me something I don't know
Take how much you hate, double that
I still make more than that
I throw your rent like it's just nothin'
It's more make double back drop
Nah, HS87 let’s get it
That’s all we know, that’s all we do
If [?] she's with it
That’s all the dough, and all the crew
When you girl get naked for pictures
So come down and get out my way
Cause them lame niggas feel good in the club
Till I stop the beat just to say

[Verse 2 : Price]
One time, Price
She come to my crib I’m never driving (I’m never driving)
She told me dive in, I drown inside it (I drown inside it)
You niggas browsin, my niggas buy it (My niggas buy it)
So many thousands, I’ll buy an island (I’ll buy an island)
I (I) ball (ball) with all the niggas I started with
I take my last call
It’s the same one when you had your daughter
Well nigga just fall back
Or you wanna play tough front page you niggas
Oh you ain’t shot, I taze you niggas
Looking at all of you rappers I raised you niggas
Your new girl is my last one, pipe long as a gas pump
Beat banging like… I'll make her (Touch it, Bring it) Daft Punk
Hs87 who better ? turn it down let me hear
Lower, a little lower
Find me a clique out [?] we kill it
Price !

[Verse 3 : Hit-Boy]
Normally the girls be with me, we just fuckin'
I cut her off if she get to fussin
We prolly act [?] I tipped the hostess
For making songs that [?] in they show
Where paper is nothing
It’s that hit boy, that mound sound
That same nigga may bow down
Got beat-beat, talking G shit
Everything I’m on, I be stick
And you know it, you know it
Get the lane out 2-4 it
2-4 it, tell the bank I’m the new owner
The new owner, my account got a few … that means
I’m shitting on all of the niggas that’s stollin' your phone
And you should come home with a G
Drop it and shake I bake it, be just like the song
And you might go home with a G
We fly like week and 2 discounts, call that shit paracel
For the ghetto bitch getting fine head in the bathtub
That’s fresh as hell
