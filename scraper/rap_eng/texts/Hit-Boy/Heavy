[Intro]
Oh man man man man
We about to go on tour
That should be pretty cool
Thank you
My nigga

[Verse 1: Price]
I'm with Maco and Ducko
Tell Ducko when we hit the A I need hoes by the bus load
But only the freaks that like women
Their thumbs in their butt-hole
I told you I'm cut-throat
(Don't judge though)
My East Coast girls love to inhale dutch smoke
Respect, the real niggas give me the upmost
This shit gon' crash the internet as soon as it upload
I trust no
Women or men
Who make demands but don't come with a plan
Off brands must run in your fam
Cause you think you a man with that gun in your hand
Stupid
(I'm a man without it)
Friday boy, you on your Craig shit
Its Friday nigga and I'm on craigslist
Cause I'm bored as shit and I wanna buy something
Having flashbacks, with my cousins
In the mall broke, I couldn't buy nothing
Now we got it popping got it live jumping
But I been waiting like my ride coming
And my ride bumping at the traffic light
Webbie on, banging Savage Life
If my money there and that package right
It's about to be a gladis night
I pull up on her, walk in the room
She asking, for rough sex
You pull up on her, y'all in the room
She asking, is it up yet?
We ain't the same nigga, 'nuff said
Oh let me guess, you got up next
Well I don't care, I'm in the in the present moment
And this a wrap like when them presents open
Time to kill the game, any last words?
You hit the hood
You won't get a pass
You'll be lucky even to get the password
To the wifi, my niggas crash nerds
Two rules, rule number one
Before you pass herb, nigga ash first
And number two before you steal my flow
I'd appreciate it if you asked first

[Hook: Oktane]
All my soldiers is ready
You know all my soldiers is ready
Benjis on benjis is heavy
Man, benjis on benjis is heavy
All my soldiers is ready
You know all my soldiers is ready
Benjis on benjis is heavy
Man, benjis on benjis is heavy

[Bridge: Price]
I'd never sell my soul for the dough
Let them know
I'd never sell my soul for the dough
Let them know

[Verse 2: Oktane]
Dumb clean, yeah I'm dumb clean
Used to walk, now I run things
I seen every whip they tryna make us quit
But I never switched, I got one team
And we ball out, its time to board now
I'm just living plans that I draw out
And my girl be tripping like it can't be different
I could get a mistress with a call now
But I'm chilling out, I put my phone down
Gotta get it cause they bluffing out here
Turning nothing into something out here
Cause our trap is booming beaming bunking out here
Lot of bitches, sorry
Lot of women
But just find your one cause it ain't nothing out here
They claim they modelling on seven bottles
But in actuality they fucking out here
(Drop that shit)
All of my soldiers is ready
You know all my soldiers is ready
So cross my line if you want to
Just make sure you know where you heading
I keep real ones in my section
Its only real ones in the section
(Only the real)
So if you ain't here don't get upset
But you probably ain't get accepted
Kevin Gates, I don't get tired
I get high, then I get inspired
I take my mind, then I get inside it
I get beats, audio piling
And I make my beats neat, auto-pilot
You see what I did there?
I'm on my shit
Get on your side, cause I'm with my clique
And fuck a hater nigga, they sing my shit
Watch

[Hook: Oktane]
[All my soldiers is ready
You know all my soldiers is ready
Benjis on benjis is heavy
Man, benjis on benjis is heavy
All my soldiers is ready
You know all my soldiers is ready
Benjis on benjis is heavy
Man, benjis on benjis is heavy

[Bridge: Price]
I'd never sell my soul for the dough
Let them know
I'd never sell my soul for the dough
Let them know

[Verse 3: OG Maco]
I'm living like diamonds, perfect
Went from mobbing to merching
From all that work I went from silent to quoted
Quotients coming bitch we good, over here
Notice notions what you looking at dear?
Get cloven explosions, orgasm in ear
I came to rumble leave a few contusions
And these rappers average with some grand delusions
In the game like a home intrusion
I want everything in the restitution
Fuck the mule, I'ma act a ass
This is execution, slightly retribution
Cause it's peons hating tryna play the music
But still play the music
Getting blazed in Munich
Bitch you major rubick
I been making movies
Im like Stanley Kubrick
Taking baths with 20s
Bitch so therapeutic
See the plans
And tryna copy movements
We 'gon convolute it
Leave their chances putrid
I could kill acoustic
Nigga fuck the woofers
Base decisions on the fact we winning
We the hottest truly and they hardly human
They like "OG Mac' can rap? I hardly knew it"
Cause you slightly stupid
Or opinionated
Fuck assimilations and these imitations
They can't replicate it
This is innovation
Best accommodate me 'fore I take your commas
Get eradicated
Fuck some simple drama
Trap dilapidated
But them junkies coming
Now I'm selling records and they celebrating
Seem so simple but its complicated
Cause my niggas hungry and the streets is warming
So by summer said I need a syndicated
All these wins and losses got us motivated
Fuck your frustration and irritation
Cause we planted seeds and
Did the irrigation
Now its illustrated like Adobe made it
Infatuated with these extra racks
Never fuck with lames
Just a culmination of the conversation that a pimp has
Now you antiquated, bin trash
Just a mitigated never sell my soul for the Ben Franklins

[Hook: Oktane]
[All my soldiers is ready
You know all my soldiers is ready
Benjis on benjis is heavy
Man, benjis on benjis is heavy
All my soldiers is ready
You know all my soldiers is ready
Benjis on benjis is heavy
Man, benjis on benjis is heavy

[Bridge: Price]
I'd never sell my soul for the dough
Let them know
I'd never sell my soul for the dough
Let them know

[Bridge: Price]
I'd never sell my soul for the dough
Let them know
I'd never sell my soul for the dough
Let them know
