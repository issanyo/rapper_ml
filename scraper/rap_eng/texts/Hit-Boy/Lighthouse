[Verse 1]
Remember when I asked you just to stay
Said you’d be gone for a while, but be back someday
But suddenly, the truth doesn’t feel so safe
You made a promise, you didn’t keep it

[Chorus]
There’s no windows in this lighthouse
No answers to the questions why
No way to be found, be found now, through the fog
So I’m trapped in this lighthouse, lighthouse

[Verse 2]
My heart is getting cold as I count the days
I would give my soul for the chance to see her
But all I see are these painted walls
I’m going crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus]
There’s no windows in this lighthouse
No answers to the questions why
No way to be found, be found now, through the fog
So I’m trapped in this lighthouse, lighthouse

[Bridge]
This cliff I’m on is too steep to climb down
I need for you to save me from drowning
And a thousand tears will make a waterfall from me, you’ll see
And it’s mighty clear that I’m not getting off this rock
So I'm stuck in this lighthouse

[Chorus]
There’s no windows in this lighthouse
No answers to the questions why
No way to be found, be found now, through the fog
So I’m trapped in this lighthouse, lighthouse
