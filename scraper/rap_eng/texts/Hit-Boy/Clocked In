[Chorus]
Clocked in, ye
I'm working around the clock, ye
Whipping my hand in the pot, ye
Pockets not down to stop
Clocked in, ye nigga clocked in
Clocked in, ye nigga clocked in

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Clocked in
Plug back in the socket [?]
[?]
Young niggas holding mob sticks
I think I made this in the tropics
My asian girl got the chopsticks
Too many ops on my line, ye
They compete for my time, ye
But I'm

[Pre-Chorus]
Clocked in, ye ye
Clocked in, ye ye
Working around the clock, ye
Whipping my hand in the pot, ye
Pockets not down to stop
HS87, high
My nigga G-Dave got my catching the vibe

[Chorus]
Clocked in, ye
I'm working around the clock, ye
Whipping my hand in the pot, ye
Pockets not down to stop
Clocked in, ye nigga clocked in
Clocked in, ye nigga clocked in

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
We-we-we-we got the money we clocked in
[?]
I might pull up in an Aston
She want the molly the same time
Trapping we was working
Up eleven-thirty
Kiss you, cook the bird
Wrist hundred-thirty, ay
I used to drip out the Rolls Royce
Flexing on purpose got no choice
I cannot fuck with them broke boys
Pull out the foreign like "Oh boy"
I was broke wan't worth alot
Back then was riding hot
Ain't got time for a thot
Spent a crib on a clock

[Chorus]
Clocked in, ye
I'm working around the clock, ye
Whipping my hand in the pot, ye
Pockets not down to stop
Clocked in, ye nigga clocked in
Clocked in, ye nigga clocked in

[Pre-Chorus]
Clocked in
Plug back [?]
[?]
Young niggas holding mob sticks
I think I made this in the tropics
My asian girl got the chopsticks
Too many ops on my line, ye
They compete for my time, ye

[Chorus]
Clocked in, ye
I'm working around the clock, ye
Whipping my hand in the pot, ye
Pockets not down to stop
Clocked in, ye nigga clocked in
Clocked in, ye nigga clocked in
