[Verse 1]
Where I am and where I go
What I do and who I know
Yeah, take a picture
Cause it's always changing
But I wanna hold on to you
Yes, I wanna hold on to you
But you're slippery like the gasoline
And you feel like fire

[Hook]
And I'm out on a limb
I'm giving in
I'm selling out, slow the pay to the show
This is my gimmick
And I wanna win it
I'm selling out, I won't fight you no more

[Verse 2]
Honey babe and honey boo
I always pictured you
By my side forever
And I can't believe that you're gone now
Cause I got a love to give
Yes, I got a love to give
I got something you should see
Baby, just come back to me cause I

[Hook]

[Break] x2
Oh, don't go away
I want you to stay
I'm-a sing you a song
Listen to my song and I hope that you like it

[Verse 3]
Hey, everybody gather 'round for me
I know I ain't the same as I used to be
But there are things that I really need
There's some people that I wanna meet
So one, two, three, let's go
Four, five, to the show
Nursery rhymes and lullabies
Gonna make you dance but I cry cause I

[Hook] x2

[Outro]
(Oh, don't go away)
Won't fight you no more
(I'm-a sing you a song
Listen to my song and I hope that you like it)
Won't fight you no more
(Oh, don't go away
I want you to stay)
I wanna win it
(I'm-a sing you a song
Listen to my song and I hope that you like it)
