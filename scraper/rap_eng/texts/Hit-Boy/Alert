[Hook: Nipsey Hussle]
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic (Nope!)
New king of this beat shit, I'm the hardest
Just being honest
You don't got a Grammy nigga, don't comment
This is my HS87 promise, I go crazy killer retarded
When I touch the beat and get started, Barry Bonds it
And I hit these hoes with the peace sign
Nigga, As-alaykum salaam it
Boy, you better get your work up
Been the same niggas since surf club
They putting on for that best side
I'mma make sure that they heard us

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
I know what it is
These niggas ain't real, tell the truth 'bout how I feel
Fuck these niggas, what's the deal?
I know what it is
Y'all forgot I ride around on the weekend
Top down for no reason, y'all was missing that G-shit
Y'all was missing that G-shit, y'all was missing that G-shit
Y'all was missing that G-shit, y'all was missing that G-shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
You ain't felt this shit since The Chronic
I'm out here on my Pac shit
She out here on her Faith Evans
Niggas still on that fraud shit
Selling out all of my concerts
Breaking bread with my dawgs, shit
Repeat the steps till we all rich
(Repeat the steps till we all rich)
I'm getting that change
Sitting on deuces, riding on [?]
One part of my brain was like
"Hussle, get to it, just sign on your name"


[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: Hit-Boy]
Look, I don't waste time, I take mine
From the state line to Boston
New York to Austin
