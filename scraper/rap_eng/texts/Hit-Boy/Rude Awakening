[Hook: Hit-Boy & (Big Hit)]
These niggas in for a rude awakening
I swear to God there ain’t no fakin' me
Bitch I’m in charge, San Diego-ing
And I’m already made, ain’t no makin' me
These niggas in for a rude awakening (bitch I’m made)
I swear to God there ain’t no fakin' me (bitch I’m made)
Bitch I’m in charge, San Diego-ing
And I’m already made, ain’t no makin' me
(Get yo grind on, I’m gone, 13 inches on the chrome)
And I’m already made, ain’t no makin' me

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Grew up bangin' niggas with a attitude
Now we the new niggas with a attitude
Pasadena, we was ridin' down Lake Avenue
Luckily my momma moved, before I had a chance to choose
My niggas, throwin' up them B's
Banging on caps lock Big C's
I been throwing up ideas
Nigga done got a side of them bleachers
Now we on the field and we Bobby Boucher shit
I’m on the 2-10 East
Blunt lit, my windows down when I’m playing this
So I say

[Hook: Hit-Boy & Big Hit]

[Verse 2: B-Mac The Queen]
Where I’m from they always carry pistols on the block
I was only 12 years old, seen my young homie get shot
Seen that white working that pot, AC don’t work and it's hot
And them dogs out with them cops, man I hated living in that spot
And now I’m with a clique, we think we the shit
Y'all pleading the fifth, y'all scared of the truth
But it's too late now, we all in this bitch
And I promise that I'ma keep it solid with y'all
I really mean it when I say, we made it me and my dogs
Hope y'all wake up

[Hook: Hit-Boy & Big Hit]

[Verse 3: Price]
I’m made there’s no making me
Don’t care what you make of me
You behind a computer creating a life
That shit is just make believe
Really just making me see it's a vacancy
Like on the whole fucking game
Like really?
There’s space for me
To come up in this ho
Quiet and gracefully
Then get to turning up
Bitch niggas take a seat
Half of the niggas that speak on me
They never be facing me
Stop all the hating
I’d rather you pray for me
Shout out to Slop Bucky
He made a way for me
I.E. shit if you owe then pay the fee
Ain't no delays, ain't no latency
And if it is then I’m slapping you facially
Cause I need mine
I’ve been waiting so patiently
Here’s your awakening nigga
