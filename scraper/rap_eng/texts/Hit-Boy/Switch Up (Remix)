[Intro: Big Sean]
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
I look up, I say I think it's time to kill it

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
We’re just somewhere off the coast in Tahiti
Island bitches in bikinis
Gettin’ freaky as a scary movie
I don’t think you read me
Blowin’ killer with my killers
HS87, the mafia
Eatin’ good, I’m faded
Drinking tequila with my tilapia
Living life like we ain't never, going no place, no place
Made a dollar a million times and I spend it all on like four days, four days
That’s just some youthful nigga shit, bitch, I’m youthful nigga rich
And I’m through with listening to these bitch niggas, they too sensitive
While all these thirsty niggas hating, I’m just taking hoes to bed
She blow for 30 M straight, I call that MC Hammer head
I swear I’m making so good, but I’m needing one stacks
Beats are so good, niggas think I can’t rap
Only young nigga, original swag
Guess I’m just paid for my different brand
All my youngers T.U., we make movies, fuck a preview
Play a full length feature if you need it when we see you
We be outside of the party, looking like a fuckin’ army base
You gon’ need an army, tanks, camouflage and body paint
If you keep the hate up, bitch nigga, get your weight up
What you make this week, I probably tip my waiter
I'm a I.E. nigga till the mothafuckin’ end
Profit in, with my clique, everything that I touch is a hit

[Hook: Big Sean]
I seen cars (switch up)
Seen Hoes (switch up)
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
Who gone leave you there and who gon leave with ya
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched
I ain't switched up naw naw I ain't switched up
Same me naw naw I ain't switch up
Same team naw naw I ain't switch up
I think it's time to kill it

[Verse 2: Price Tag]
Alright lemme go to work, I got heat to disperse
Same 2 young niggas that taught you how to jerk
Can probably teach you how to murk
Any nigga, any beat, I'll defeat, rest in peace in the hearse
40k for me to speak on ya' verse, your wife upon her knees till they hurt
Booty cheek out the skirt, when she twerk, that the least of the perks
Lemme preach to the church
Fortress in the hills, that’s what I stays up been
Medusa head, Versace sheets, that's what she lays up in
Used to be blacks killing blacks, ain’t no way to win
It’s crazy, now my pocket full of dead Caucasian men
Getting money like Asian man, pockets filling so Buddha fat
Scratching all on them claudicate, IE, Price true to that
Heard you snitchin', nigga you's a rat, you talk booster, that’s booster rap
We never letting our shooter strapped
Please don’t make a nigga have to use the Mac
Every nigga I came with, get the real dough
Every nigga I came with, I would kill fo’
Christian Dior clothes to cover my wounds
And got Balenciaga Arenas to cover my toes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Oktane]
Alright, same team , same jersey, we the Lakers, James Worthy
Your formula ain’t working, meanwhile we got the whole game twerkin’
Them same niggas that saying that bread changed us and we act funny
Them same niggas that’s acting brand-new when they got they tax money
So stop hating on young niggas, that’s shining on all you dumb niggas
I'm Tarzan, and my car's brand-new but I.E. is where I’m from nigga
Yeah, Fontana, Colton, where Bakers at, like 40 miles from where the Lakers at
I’m the best I promise, lemme use that flow that Ace Hood said that everybody taking now
I’m the best youngin' that’s rapping
I’m on your heels, Teneken
I hate people that act real cause I’m too real to be acting
I got my head down when I’m rocking, balloons, I’m poppin
I swear we got TV's on us, cause ain't nobody stop watching
Boy, you wanna be in our section, huh, your girl and the girl next to her
I'm a very important person now, VIP has just become regular
Yeah them jerk boys really rap, nigga
Plain and simple, we back, nigga
I'm Oktane, call me the run-away slave, cause I'm that nigga that got money ....

[Hook]

[Outro]
Motherfuckers, I keep on trying tell y'all niggas
I swear, I keep on trying tell y'all niggas
We the coldest young niggas, listen to this shit, we give it away for free
You need these keys nigga, I later
You need these keys nigga, I later
Period, I play my own shit
HS87, that's what the fuck we do, bitch!
