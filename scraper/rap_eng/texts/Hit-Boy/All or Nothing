[Intro]
Ayo this shit like the superbowl
It's us against them Bad Boy bitch Coke Boys
Verse everybody

[Hook]
I want it all or nothing, don't give me nothing
Don't give me nothing
Ayo French, yo, talk to 'em
I want it all or nothing, these niggas be fronting
These niggas be fronting
You know what I'm talking 'bout
You came here with nothing, you leave here with nothing
You know what I'm talking 'bout, you know what I'm talking 'bout

[Verse 1: French Montana]
She came here with nothing, she gon' leave with nothing
I was born with nothing, gon' die with nothing
My dome is strapped and she'll die for nothing
You came here for them, came out with nothing
My whole team stunting, neck full of gold, haaan
I'm high and drunk, don't listen to this
No OG or Puff, got Christian women
She came from the block, it was picture women
Hop on this yacht, come fishing with me
All these bad bitches taking pictures with me
All the police taking pictures of me
New Lambo, old pistol with me
Got bando out the window of it

[Hook]
I want it all or nothing, don't give me nothing
Don't give me nothing
Ayo French, yo, talk to 'em
I want it all or nothing, these niggas be fronting
These niggas be fronting
You know what I'm talking 'bout
You came here with nothing, you leave here with nothing
You know what I'm talking 'bout, you know what I'm talking 'bout

[Verse 2]
I want it all
You want it too but shit, I want it more
I had a ball
I spoke to Ye, he said "I am a god"
Got no time though
You know what I'm talking 'bout?
You can't take it with you, you might as well ball
You know what I'm talking 'bout?
I take from the rich and I give to the poor
I want it all or nothing, don't give me nothing
I was born with nothing, gon' die with nothing
They ain't give me nothing so I owe 'em nothing

[Hook]
I want it all or nothing, don't give me nothing
Don't give me nothing
Ayo French, yo, talk to 'em
I want it all or nothing, these niggas be fronting
These niggas be fronting
You know what I'm talking 'bout
You came here with nothing, you leave here with nothing
You know what I'm talking 'bout, you know what I'm talking 'bout

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I want all the weed, I want all the cheese
I want a bad bitch from overseas
I need my dick sucked, I mean, on your knees
I roll a paper plane, go where I'm supposed to be
I'm probably in the clouds and I ain't looking down
No problems, I got all smiles
The niggas with me, they all wild
Counting money, let it all pile
They've been waiting a long while
For a young nigga with his own style
She hit my phone and I go to her house
Give me that brain, told her open her mouth
Know when I'm 'bout, money, marijuana, pussy
Some things I don't go without
Come to my house, probably get lost
Have you stuffing weed in cones you won't make it out
I be so high that I'm floating
Fucked this bitch and now she open
Talking 'bout she want a real one
All these niggas, I don't feel none
Hundred thousand dollar bills on her
Wrote another thousand dollar meal
I'm the king and all my niggas loyal still
Take your bitch and fuck her, crazy for the thrill
I ain't tripping on you niggas cause I'm making paper
Laugh now, she gon' fuck me later
Smell the KK from the elevator
No phones, they investigators
