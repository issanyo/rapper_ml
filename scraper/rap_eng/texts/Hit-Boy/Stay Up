[Chorus: Sage The Gemini]
Ahhh
Fuck what they think, just keep giving it up to me
And it’s a hard job, I understand
When you become fly just do not land
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Sallie May, she come from the Bay
Grown up from East Oakland quote a lot of Mac Dre
She used to niggas telling lies and putting schemes on her
They don't never wanna put a motherfucking ring on her
She strip and go to college, going hard in the city
Got that financial aid, put in all in her titties
And her ass all silly, waist all skinny, and she pretty
So she fuck with niggas with the bands and Billy's

[Chorus: Sage The Gemini]
Ahhh
Fuck what they think, just keep giving it up to me
And it’s a hard job, I understand
When you become fly just do not land
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Roll up, light up, smoke up, inhale high up we go
Until it's breakfast, one more session
Then she exits
Back up to the town for that grip
She ain't never had shit, so she get it how she live
And I be feeling that's it's cool for a player smooth pimpin'
Know the rules on these strippers, but I view you different
I must be trippin', like I got a pill in my system
Baby just keep doing you and stay on your money mission

[Chorus: Sage The Gemini]
Ahhh
Fuck what they think, just keep giving it up to me
And it’s a hard job, I understand
When you become fly just do not land
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up
Stay up, stay up, stay up, stay up

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
Ahh
Don't play no games with it, girl go do yo thang
(go do yo thang)
Don't play no games with it, girl go do yo thang
(go do yo thang)
I know they judging you, I know they speak it
They talking, but that pole money got you a Benz, they walking
Don't don't play no games with it, girl go do yo thang
(go do yo thang)
Don't play no games with it, girl go do yo thang
(go do yo thang)
So back it up (So back it up), and drop it down (and drop it down)
And let me know, I'll travel across the globe
(he may go do like that)

[Verse 3: K. Roosevelt]
Oh, tell me where you at
I have visions of you sitting on my lap girl
I was touching on yo ass
I feel like we need it back girl
We probably said some shit we didn't mean
But we can put it in the past girl
Roll an L and have some laugh girl
(But when we end up in the bed, just remember)
We ain't making up, we just making love (We ain't making up)
We ain't making up, we just making love (we just making love)
I know it’s getting late yeah but girl I'm on my way
So keep it girl to stay up (girl I'm on my way)
Stay up (girl I'm on my way)
Stay up
(I.E stay up, all around the world stay up)
Stay up
(LA stay up, all my niggas from the Bay stay up)
Stay up
(H.B.K. stay up, Plug niggas stay up)
Stay up
(West Side stay up, and ya bitch know I stay up)
Stay up
Hey
