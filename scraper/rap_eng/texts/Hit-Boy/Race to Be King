[Intro: Hit-Boy]
In the...
In the race to be the...
In the...
Look

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
I see why they mad at us
I ain't never run, I ran it up
Sticking to the code, [?] glove
From now on address me as the plug
Don't need you to stand, but, now, look
We know nothing's promised in this thing
They thought I just popped up in this thing
Niggas in the race to be king
It's all about timing from what I seen, ayy
Going, plaques on the way
I got more shit and more shit
I'm the hardest nigga who ain't never had promotion
Chopper still wet, when it rains, yeah, it pours
Checks on my account, checks on my Air Force
Life is too short, money getting tall
It don't grow on trees, hustle for it all
Diamonds on my fingers look like lightning
Listen to the beat, I got it slide in
Popped, now they want to see me fizzle
Size of the chip on my shoulder, [?] triple
Was at Westbrook, zero, now I'm going for the triple
Like my nigga, Larry June, I'm off the dribble

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
I see why they mad at us
I ain't never run, I ran it up
Sticking to the code, [?] glove
From now on address me as the plug
Don't need you to stand, but, now, look
We know nothing's promised in this thing
They thought I just popped up in this thing
Niggas in the race to be king
It's all about timing from what I seen, ayy

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
I told y'all, game go how it go
If it ain't about dough, I put that shit on Hov
Damn, I put that shit on Hov...
Keep everything solid til' they lined up
150 through [?]
Fuck taking shit personal, I take flights
They want me to break, but I'm lit like brake lights
Did the beat and the rhyme, you gon' have to pay twice
Puttin' on everyday, I put that on this ice
Nigga, we goin' live, I don't do shit for likes
Coming straight off the hip, gotta let this shit fly
Bartender refill my glass, make it straight
Throwin' back doubles, shaking off the hate

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
I see why they mad at us
I ain't never run, I ran it up
Sticking to the code, [?] glove
From now on address me as the plug
Don't need you to stand, but, now, look
We know nothing's promised in this thing
They thought I just popped up in this thing
Niggas in the race to be king
It's all about timing from what I seen, ayy
