[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Half-A-Milly
Been to much in the breeze too far
Ain't nothing we can't do, we go hard, yeah

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Smoke, smoke, bitch
Finna text the addie, bring a close friend, yeah
Young nigga had a close car, put it out one time
It was no talk
Hit it and she ain't gettin' no call
Ain't too many niggas prayin' that I don't fall
That's the main reason I'm gon' ball
I'ma get it eitherway it go, underground or radio
Pullin' off in Chevys and Durango
I make a freak bitch wake up and change clothes
I need space, hoe
Let me get it breathin', pimpin' in my blood
Since Nas did "Ether"
Crack a bitch over a cold slice of pizza
I'm young HB, it's nice to meet ya
And you ain't never seen a nigga like this
The second you catch a nut, I catch a second win, yeah
That's just how a young nigga live, yeah
5:30AM, we still lit, yeah
[?] to the backwood, keep it lit, yeah
In the bed, playing with the pigeon on the [?], yeah
Locked in, we can't miss
We don't connect, cause we ain't on the same shit
Rate the flex, I been on the same kick
When we talking bout the numbers forth, it ain't big

[Chorus: Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy]
Been to much in the breeze too far
Ain't nothing we can't do, we go hard, yeah
Been to much in the breeze too far
Ain't nothing we can't do, we go hard, yeah
We go...

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Her game just as smooth as me on this
We just met though, how we gon' kiss
I'm like, no, no, bitch
Let's meet at the Turner, bring a close friend
She don't even fuck with bananas though
But pull my pants down, than I roll up
People knockin' on the door, I'm like: "So what?"
Baby, you fine, but I really can't bless you
I have a lot of girls already, no extras
Locked in, we can't miss
I only talk about who I already hit
She been advanced since 2010
Hit it and I don't get no calls
She like: "Shut the fuck up, Dom. It's your fault"
I'm at the blackjack table, holding both cards
That's why I'm leavin' by myself in that golf cart
You ain't never seen a nigga like this
The second you catchin' up, I'm catchin' my second win
Ain't really nothing out here, that we ain't did
When we talkin' bout the numbers forth, it ain't big
(When we talkin' bout the numbers forth, it ain't big, big
When we talkin' bout the numbers forth
Numbers forth, it ain't big)
