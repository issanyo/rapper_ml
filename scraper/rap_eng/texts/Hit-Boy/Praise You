[Intro]
Praise, praise, praise, praise
Praise, praise, praise, praise
I just wanna praise you

[Verse 1: Price]
Uh, you gotta love how it worked out
You work hard and you work out
But you keep it cool, you was raised in a church house
Them Hit-Boy chords known to bring the church out!
You been hurting now you fragile
For your love I'll go to war, I'll go to battle
I'd lock you down if I had a shackle
Church, preach, tabernacle
What it ain't? What it is?
What it ain't? What it is?
If you ain't scared to do your dance then hit the floor cause this your jam
What it ain't? What it is?
What it ain't? What it is?
You're the woman a man needs cause you don't need a man
That's perfect, just hit me on my line
Don't be blind to them niggas chasing after your behind
You do it for that boy who taught the world how to shine
You don't do it for the vine that's why I had to make you mine
Go

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild+ Price]
They want you gone
I want your time
They want you out your clothes
I want you mine
Let me praise you
Let me praise you
Girl I just wanna praise you
They want you gone
I want your time
They want you out your clothes
I want you mine
Let me praise you
Don't stop
Let me praise you
Don't stop
Let me praise you
Don't stop
Let me praise you

[Verse 2: Oktane]
Alright, you don't like clubs, I think that's perfect
But chivalry died and girls named it thirsty
And I'm still finding myself opening doors and giving flowers and making sure you walk in first
And when I sit back and break Pineapple Express open
They look for love with their eyes closed and their legs open
These other girls always single with the summer
Just young and having fun I don't judge 'em but you know
One lucky woman is gonna get the opportunity to come and get a wedding ring from me
And they hit me then sitting next to you
Doing absolutely nothing means absolutely everything to me
So I had to make a song for when you're alone and I'm not on the phone you can play this and never cry
I guess I did it I finally get it when they say if a writer falls in love with you then you can never die
And this'll out-live me

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild+ Price]
They want you gone
I want your time
They want you out your clothes
I want you mine
Let me praise you
Let me praise you
Girl I just wanna praise you
They want you gone
I want your time
They want you out your clothes
I want you mine
Let me praise you
Don't stop
Let me praise you
Don't stop
Let me praise you
Don't stop
Let me praise you

[Outro: Musiq Soulchild]
What you doing girl? You doing it right
Don't stop doing it
Praise you
I just wanna praise you girl
Praise you
Praise you
Praise you
Praise you
