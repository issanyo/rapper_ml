[Intro]
I said it must be, mmm... Street, mmm...
16 a week
But I'm... I need you guys to do me a favor if you will
And spitting these 16 bars
Post this to your Facebook or Twitter or Facebook and Twitter
And have target "Street Light - Goldie"
Thank you!

[Verse]
Because you are now listening
My newest style addition these bars for the youngins
Like Juvenile prisons and you couldn't out-spit him
If he's in the hospital even when without rhythm
You can't win without wisdom. 
Forget (Guinness)
I'm aiming much higher with (dos equis) over eyes from a brush fire. . . PACE myself
Call me Reggie Miller (Lite) Light, sir
I may be a kid, but I bet this BUD's WISER (Budweiser)
Than most guys pushing 35 chasing rolled kaiser
Rhyme like me when I was 5
Heard y'all don't wanna DANCE cuz, be it as it were
I can't believe y'all still TICKING like a bunch of OLD TIMERS
And they don't want your SECOND-HAND lyrics
This is brand new
I'm just an example of what your spirit can't do
Fear the unicycle flow
Can't HANDLE BARS on this WAX
But the LIGHT'S on TOP LIKE A CANDLE
