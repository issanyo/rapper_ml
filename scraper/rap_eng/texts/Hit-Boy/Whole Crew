[Verse 1]
And you know I like everything that make sense
If I wasn't rappin', I'll probably take bricks
I be in the Trap, yeah I work the late shift
My brother sip codeine like he stay sick
And niggas still on that hatin' shit
You a worker, I can tell you don't make shit
Glock got no safety, but I'm safe bitch
Shawty got good brain, don't waste it
Yeah, my whole crew in the place bitch
Off lean, movin' slow like the Matrix
And I'm the man in different states bitch
They know the words, I ain't even gotta say shit
And all my hoes, they thick
And I'm allergic to the fake shit
And my mama told me that I ain't shit
When the cops grabbed me I ain't say shit

[Hook] x2
Yeah, my whole crew in the place bitch
Yeah, my whole crew in the place bitch
Yeah, my whole crew in the place bitch
They know the words, I ain't even gotta say shit


[Verse 2]
Young niggas got tools, they'll drop shit
Watch the world go crazy when I drop this
Lil Bibby, all I do is spit hot shit
When you hit the mall, you don't never cop shit
Yeah, tell them niggas top this
Yeah, them haters can't stop this
Nah, I don't do that bop shit
And they know I had dimes like Stockton
Yeah, my whole crew in the place bitch
These rap niggas broke, niggas ain't rich
I just tell it like it is on that 'Ye shit
You was poppin tryna throw it in my face bitch
Yeah, tell them haters quit talkin'
Yeah, tell yo bitch quit stalkin'
Yeah, my whole crew gettin' off
Shorty goin' cause my whole clique ballin'
