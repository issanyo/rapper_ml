[Intro]
Yo, yeah-yeah, yeah
Ah, couldn't
Yeah

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
You couldn't judge me
You couldn't judge me
You ain't been through the shit that I've been
You ain't have to see the shit that I've seen

[Verse 1]
Been in the darkest places
Made the hardest decisions
I'm a rap star for a living
But I gotta father my children
All I know is confusion
That's all that I know, yeah
Yeah, that's all that I know
It's a lot of mine
See as far as it goes
Yeah, inspire some hope
Do that shit before I go, yeah

[Chorus : Quentin Miller]
You couldn't judge me
You couldn't judge me
You ain't been through the shit that I've been
You ain't have to see the shit that I've seen
(couldn't judge me)

[Verse 2 : HitBoy]
Couldn't, yeah
Couldn't judge me
Couldn't judge me
Shit get ugly, I'm not running
Hit boy run it up with this money
Might as well heat up the stove
I feel my heart getting cold
Tip the valet at the grove
'Fore my OG's is gone
Spending time in a hole
Probably won't see parole
Yeah, walking on this lonely road
Did my best to help niggas get on
They couldn't stick to the code

[Chorus: Quentin Miller & HitBoy]
You couldn't judge me
You couldn't judge me
You couldn't judge me
You couldn't judge me
Couldn't judge me
Couldn't judge me
Shit get ugly, I'm not running
I'm not running
Couldn't judg-
