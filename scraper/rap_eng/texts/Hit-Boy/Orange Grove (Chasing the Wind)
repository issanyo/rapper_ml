[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Yeah
Look
Goin' in right now

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Millions on my menu
Fuck who came with you
Bitch we pay big dues
It could be so simple
For real, it could be so simple
Too much time to think in back [?]
I need niggas to acknowledge this
The USA got more jails than colleges
And what ain't so common, is common sense
Fuck the politicians and their politics, shit
My grandmother been in the same apartment
Since before [?] at the Obama
Than I go online and just want the drama
While I'm stacking commas and good karma
Billions on my menu
Fuck who came with you
Bitch we pay big dues
It could be so simple
It could be so simple
Niggas ain't no call when the rent due
But they still feel entitled to ball with you
How many songs you poured your heart into
How many moves have you made in designer shoes
While niggas hoping you lose
No fake news, I'm not reading your reviews
Circle smaller than the tire tubes
Gotta get you name up till it's set in stone
I been preppin' for this shit since Orange Grove

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Millions on my menu
Fuck who came with you
Bitch we pay big dues
It could all be so simple
For real, for real, for real

[Bridge: Scratches]

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
This time it's for the win
High off another sip
If I fuck up the bag
I hit another lick
Whip a beat, like they [?] used to whip a brick
Niggas wanna see my name on the injure list
Face mask on, [?]
Six figures for the Gatorade ad, [?]
Grew a grip from the pain and the challenges
That's why I'm in this bitch, askin' where the salad is
Gotta stop chasin' after the wind
Stay solid with me, that's my only wish, ay

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Millions on my menu
Fuck who came with you
Bitch we pay big dues
It could be so simple
For real, it could be so simple
