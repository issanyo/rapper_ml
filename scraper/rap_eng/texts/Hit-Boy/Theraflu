[Verse 1]
Yeah, look, my bank account, tellin' me to calm down
The billboards tellin' me to climb down
Ha, niggas pillow talkin', let me find out
Could give a fuck about later, bitch, I'm on now
Ha, you know the shine is what I do though
Bitch, you know I'm flexin', I bought a necklace and a 2 door
Monday in the Rolly, Tuesday in the Hublot
R&B killin' rap niggas, that’s just what I do though
These niggas is lame, they always complain and doin' the same shit
Get all up on Twitter, tryna get followers, suckin' the same dick
I'm tired of these niggas, tired of arguin' over the same bitch
Niggas funny like comics, I'm wealthy, nigga, I ain't rich
My shit be up in galleries, a million when I paint, bitch
Pop records bought me this Ferrari, that’s a lane switch
Switch it up on you niggas, watch my number change
Grown up on you niggas, yeah, my number changed
Hit-boy, all these rappers wastin' beats
I bought all my clique toys, ain't no niggas wastin' heat
Yeah, I talk that big noise, aka I'm TNT
I blow that shit up, get up 'cause, boy, you can’t get rid of
Don’t fuck with my old bitch, it’s like a bad fur
Every industry nigga done had her
Trick or treat like a pumpkin just to smash her
Bitches breakin' codes, but I'm the password
Now it’s time for young niggas to shut down shit
If you yappin' in the club then you surrounded
They say he trippin' on some greyhound shit
He didn't listen, now he listenin' to the ground, bitch
Put him out, he’s sleepin'
With all the sneakers on his chest, he barely breathin'
Like it’s lights out, he took a beatin'
Hand on his chest, holdin' his heart, pledge of allegiance

[Hook]
Damn, his bitch cold, need a theraflu
Took ‘em shoppin', bought ‘em fifteen-hundred pair of shoes
Ha, theraflu
I'm a cold ass nigga, fuck you
