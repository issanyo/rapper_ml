I'm way past gone
I'm drowning to the bottom of this bottle
And I'mma let it wash away my sorrows
Numbing all the pain till tomorrow
I'm way past gone
Never been on this level right here
Feeling faded, feel so intoxicated
And I'm the only one around here
Cus I was in the dark room
Loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get messed up, filling up my cup
And see the crowd move
Spittin' these lines, gettin' ya hyped
Taking a seat need to get my shit right
Focus tonight, Party all night
We'll Do it again like Im pushing rewind

Hook:
I'm never babysitting, I've been lining up shots
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor than you dive in it
Pool full of liquor than you dive in it
I wave a few bottles and I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it all

Pour up (drank!) head shot (drank!) sit down (drank)
Pass out (drank!) wake up (drank) faded (drank!) faded (drank)

Me and my homies roll deep pulling up to the party
Everywhere that im looking around everybody is sipping Bacardi
And even though that im Bengali isn't it shocking that im at the party
Surrounded by these demons and they told me it barley started
They know that I barley drink and I came prepared with just my blunt
And its filled with kush that quality purp, watching their sorrows go down with a curse
Thirsty for more and they all on the floor, sober girls and they actin drunk
Passing their cup and they wanting to fuck excuse is that they were drunk
So I took some shot and another shots my needle hole is on the dot
And these demons know , all of the spots its entering inside my thoughts
And its creeping slowly as it holds me feeling like this was a story
Their presence had me worried as they whispered and they told me

Me and my family have lived through the struggle been at the bottom
Drinking devil juice, my life is stuck in the bottle making a wish
Praying to god that I wake up tomorrow
Head shots of buchanas me estoy empedando , soy mexicano
Vivos o muertos mi raza es pesada
Forgetting my name , going insane
Killing my brain , tell me why I haven't changed ?
Is it because I still love the woman that ripped open my veins
Aren't you seeing my tears , crying of fear
Spilling my soul , quiet can't you hear ?
My only friend at the moment is this bottle of beer
1 shot I'm good
2 shots I'm buzzed
3 shots a home run I'm drinking it up
1 for the money
2 for the women
3 for the way I'm living it up
Slowing it down , 1 passed my limit
Cause the only person that took a hit was Jesus
If I die tonight I don't want to hell's prison
