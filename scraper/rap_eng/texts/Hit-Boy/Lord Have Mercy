[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Lord have mercy, I ain't showin' no mercy
Murderous thoughts since I made 20 off my first beat
Before Hit was, nervous on stage at Bercy
Clique shoes, the game tried to do me dirty
HS87 look at the back of my jersey
We closin' in on a opposition thirty
I'm on my shift early
Throwin' ingredients in a sauce pan, whippin'
House Of Hits from head to toe just to pop off, drippin'
Aquafina water with the top off, get it?
Me and Quentin, both lucky
Our clique name end with a 7
Amazing how they lettin' shit this good goin' old
It's only makin' me more focused, fuck 'em we ball

[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Lord have mer-
Lord have mer-
Lord have mercy, I ain't showin' no mercy
After HTA3 the price surging
1-3-1-7 I put it first and
HS87 tighter than virgins

[Verse 2: Quentin Miller]
We both rap but I'm the better version
Not ashamed the Rental came with insurance
Lord have mercy, I ain't showing no mercy
Every, snare and kicks from Hit hurts 'em
You can't sleep forever, I let you rest
You girl thought about me and said better yet
The fuelband accounting for every step
I hit the track and turn it to Grand Theft
Five stars, my bars, they can't catch me
Turned down a lot of your favorite rappers
I don't need nobody, I wouldn't lie
You ain't heard nobody that brought it to you in this fashion
Since Push from way back when
Ask Cam where the ticket, we taxing
Ask Cas reffering hit, we taxing
We had to take the game, fuck asking
They thought that they could get rid of me actually
I'm hearing they got to live off me actually
Lord have mercy, can't let 'em relax man
No mercy nigga it's a wrap man

[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Lord have mercy, I ain't showin' no mercy
After Zoomin' 2 the price surging
1-3-1-7 I put it first and
HS87 tighter than virgins

[Verse 3: Price]
I'm heaven sent, never been scared of shit bone crushing taught me
Presidents on me, presidential don't need a car key
Beep beep
Speakin' of car keys, don't you start me, get off me
Soon as you said "we" that's where you lost me, ooh
So don't associate me with the broke and flaky
You nothin' close to greatness you supposed to hate me
Lord have mercy I'm stuck in this shit
While you was stuck to a bitch, I stuck to the script
Free my mind, got on the grind  and put my trust in my clique
Me and my pen went overtime there ain't no luck with the shit
Lord have mercy, heard he fucked with the first week
I'm from where niggas get DP'd if they verse weak
My new shawty got more ass than church seats
I came with Miller I ain't talkin' bout Percy
23 roses in the club don't let 'em search me
You versus me,  you just a earthling - I'm a God,  you never heard me
Fall back

[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Lord have mercy, I ain't showin' no mercy
After Zoomin' 2 the price surging
1-3-1-7 I put it first and
HS87 tighter than virgins
