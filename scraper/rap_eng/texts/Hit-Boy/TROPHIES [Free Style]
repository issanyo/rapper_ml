[Verse 1: VZ]
Made hit records in my closet
I’m just being honest
I don’t feed into the gossip
I’m not here for the profit, though
Future Teller; Seasoned dweller
[Yeah] Kinda like a prophet, though
Really I’m just about to blow
This is not a love song
Fuck You all, I’m on song
Bout done, I’ve had enough song
Fuck you thought it was son?
I’m on the grind to get some
Get you head in check, before you do something you’ll regret son
They Tryn’a get up on my level
Bunch of square-niggas steady Tryn’a breach the inner-circle
I’m just Tryn’a reach my inner-circle
Encircled by fakes; I was just built for the make
You could learn from my traits
I’ve been grinding all day nigga
Leaving them dazed nigga
I’m just counting the day’s nigga
Awaiting the praise nigga!
[Yeah] This is not a love song
Fuck You all, I’m on song
Bout done, I’ve had enough song
Fuck you thought it was son?

[Hook]
You can't stop a nigga;You can't drop a nigga
You can't stop a nigga;You can't drop a nigga
You can't stop a nigga;You can't drop a nigga
You can't stop a nigga;You can't drop a nigga
You can't stop a nigga;You can't drop a nigga

[Bridge]
Where the hells this shuttle from?
Oh my what I've stumbled on (X2)
