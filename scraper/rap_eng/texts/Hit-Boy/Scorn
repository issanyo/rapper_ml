[Verse 1: Oktane]
What the fuck is you living for?
You living the life or living the lie?
Or living to die? Nigga decide
‘Cause they say “Cash Rules Everything Around Me”
So I make sure cash be the only thing around me
I’m living on the up and up so fuck you if you down me
Nigga what the fuck is up? Just tell the people "Crown me"
Incredible music from young blacks, astounding
Tears for your fears ‘til the motherfuckers drowning

[Hook]
Taking good from scorn
I know that I have more
True to blood and form
These mistakes I get paid for
(That's the break, y'all)

[Verse 2: Price]
Open your eyes, yeah, I’m in your face
Try to time what I’m finna say, I bet you be a minute late
You're always off tryna emulate what's current
What's poppin', section hoppin', boppin', I'm finna shake
I need hundred kush stems to stimulate
The fact I probably commit a hundred sins a day
I’m ‘bout a sin away from watching my whole life disintegrate
But fuck that, I’m finna get it right before it end today!

[Hook]
Taking good from scorn
I know that I have more
True to blood and form
These mistakes I get paid for
(That's the break, y'all)

[Refrain]
Bam pop pop bam
Bam pop pop bam
Bam pop pop bam
Bam pop pop bam
Bam pop pop bam
Bam pop pop bam
Bam pop pop bam
Bam pop pop bam

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Oh life gets you down and sometimes so many people cut you down
Sometimes, learn, forgive and forgetting it don’t make no sense
Then they keep on and you go, you shine, oh, you shine, like hot
On the ten and my Porsche all black and the top yahm, down
Me and dark skin Den in it to win, we flexin' on these niggas what yahm down
Go get a clue, consumin' and elude, give these niggas room
Can't breathe in a crowd, destruction coming soon
'Till we conclude, can get in tune
Or get the fuck out, no pussies allowed

[Verse 4: Hit-Boy]
Too many people raising hell, I’m raising heaven
At least I’m raising my hand to the sky where I said
I had a dream I felled victim to society’s plan
And I was thirty-six sitting in economy class
Mayday we’re going down, grab your oxygen mask
I don’t know what happened next, we probably crashed
The moral of the story is to follow your path
And tell the people your dreams, and if it causes a laugh
Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going

[Verse 5: Kent M$NEY]
Don’t be surprised if I never stop
Some people rise but they never drop
Rose just to pedal cop
We take care of our situations
Honesty’s a must, word to blunts we keep in rotation
Jew connects to get the flow up
No, the grass ain’t greener on the other side, just cut a little lower
Feel like I'm forever haunted by some promises made to myself
For wanting things to make you harness insane lord
