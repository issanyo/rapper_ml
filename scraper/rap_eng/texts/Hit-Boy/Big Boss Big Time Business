[Verse 1]
Mama says a what she want
Mama says a what she want
If you mess with me, you wrestlin' with the deep
I tell you what
Yes, you like a sycophant, hit you like an elephant
‘Fore you know I got you where I want like a wonder woman

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know it's heavy, heavy, heavy
'Cause I shoot straight and I shoot steady, steady, steady
Maybe you wonder, come and get me, get me, get me
You rub me wrong and I get testy, testy, testy

[Chorus]
Big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one
Like a big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one
Big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one
Like a big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one

[Post-Chorus]
I got the mouth full of venom
I got the key to the system
I got the beats, let it hit them
I got it all, wanna get some?

[Verse 2]
Mama take a what she want
Mama take a what she want
If ya wait and see, with no army she win
Get what she want
Baby cry, she hush him up
Hubby think he run the show
Go to work, she wreckin' shit like a bulldozer, rake it up

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know it's heavy, heavy, heavy
'Cause I shoot straight and I shoot steady, steady, steady
Maybe you underestimate me, maybe, maybe
I got it, you can come and get it, get it, get it

[Chorus]
Big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one
Like a big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one
Big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one
Like a big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one

[Post-Chorus]
I got the mouth full of venom
I got the key to the system
I got the beats, let it hit them
I got it all, wanna get some?

[Bridge]
Don’t got no time for your huffin’
Don’t got no time for your bark
Know when I want to, Imma take ya
And it don’t matter who you are, I gotta tell you

[Chorus]
Big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one
Like a big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one
Big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one
Like a big boss, big time business
Make me your mark and I'll take you one by one

[Post-Chorus]
I got the mouth full of venom
I got the key to the system
I got the beats, let it hit them
I got it all, wanna get some?
