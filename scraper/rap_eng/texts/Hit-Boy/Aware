[Intro]
(2x)
You are now
You are now
You are now
Aware of the queen (good shit)

[Verse 1]
Look, aye don't be asking for no free shit (nigga)
When you know my bills due
I don't like these rappers
This shit is felling like middle school
And I'm the only kid thats in the building thats gone keep it true
Whats cool that you cool and all
But you don't influence dog
And you don't be speaking that real life in the music song
You swimming in Benjamin's
Just admit that you fool as all
Cause in reality you by the pool with some pumas on

[Bridge]
So do us a favor y'all
Get out the way and let a winner preach (preach)
See you a deacon for them leaches
Thats steady reaching creeping up on my body
Why don't you let me be
I heard you like to suck (suck my energy)
The only remedy I know
Get a pen
Write a song
Fifth of hen
Light a bong
Repents and right her wrong
And I try to forgive the people that hurt me
But I know that they gone hate to see me flourish

[Verse 2]
Cause I am the power
I am the courage
I am the people
Don't you ever get discouraged
I am the reason that somebody getting nervous
Like got damn my nigga I'm just trying to serve my purpose
You ain't got to close the door on me
Just let me in and let my posse eat
Everything 100 over here
You get a lot of me
I done cried so many fucking tears its getting hard to see
1000 miles and running for that money
Callus on my feet
I swear so much to say
Will they ever listen
If I don't pay the price for fame
Will they pay attention
If I say fuck social media
Will I get a mention
If female rappers sucks to me
Is that considered dissing
If I don't pay my rent on time
Will I get evicted
If I don't get the proper shine you gone be a victim
Oh I know that it takes some time
I'm a keep on bitching
Cause I know I got better rhymes than all of these niggas

[Bridge]
Whats up
Niggas be dykes you can't tell me otherwised
If I look them in they eyes I can see through their disguise
All man, I can tell by the way you staring
All man, you got a pussy in your pants
All man, I really jiving I'm jiving
Im on the passenger seat and my bitch driving
She driving and she gone wobble de wobble de
Oochie wally got wildebeest on my toes
Too swift on them to get caught up with hoes

[Verse 3]
I mean I use to think that I wasn't good enough
My team ain't supportive
My manager he ain't booking much
Thought maybe if I shed a couple pounds and stop looking rough
I get into position
Fuck it thats how I look to stuff
But I am my own woman
I carry my own weight
I burry these other rappers
I eat off my own plate
With various styles
Consider me like an old great
In love with this crazy bitch called life
She my soulmate
Im living in the city where them skinny niggas murder for a penny
No crustaceans
Niggas happy for a skillet up a Denny's

[Outro]
Yeah Im a chill for a minute
Y'all muthafuckers trying to take all my energy
Y'all act like I don't know it though
Fuck it, aye

You are now
You are now
You are now
Aware of the queen
Aware of the queen

Niggas may not understand it now (now now now now now)
But they will (will will will will will)
Niggas may not understand it now (now now now now now)
We the plug
But they will
