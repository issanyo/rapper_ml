[Verse 1 : Oktane]
Look
[?]
We go to the top, they gon argue you goin' or not ?
You say you do something to stop
That's worse than the cops
We come for it all in one wop
Too many people say they can, they think they can
And that's the problem today we gon' drop it
Me I take every problem, right it down and I solve it
And that's why I play and you watchin'
Cheerleaders only cheer for players
Your jacket ain't even got the patches on it
Got the ratchet homies, keep the ratchet on 'em
This ain't even work for me it's practice homie
And I practice only on the days that ended why
That's why I'm finna be and always be the guy
Ain't no talkin' I'm the best
I need a judge and a medal and a vest
Plug!


[Hook : Oktane (BMac)]
It's the super hero music nigga
Hey scream your name and how you feel
See the loosers gon' focus on winners
And winners only focus on winning
Let's get it
Comming for it all in one wop
(We come for it all in one wop)
Comming for it all in one wop
(We come for it all in one wop)
Comming for it all in one wop
(We come for it all in one wop)
Comming for it all in one wop
(We come for it all in one wop)
