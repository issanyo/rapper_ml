[Chorus: Price]
See I made it of the block way
I don't talk, they just do it
Now we celebrate a way to bring a bottle of fluid
Yeah, I started in the kitchen, now we're strapping every week
And wasn't worried about the niggas who was clapping in the streets
Cause they were with me (the long way)
I'm getting money (the long way)
I'm in the streets (the long way)
Them women love me (the long way)
They were with me (the long way)
I'm getting money (the long way)
I'm in the streets (the long way)
Them women love me (the long way)

[Verse 1: Price]
Alright, I came here like four shadows
Money gotta whole lotta
Take my team all around the world
And we ball, we're the globe-trotters
When it comes to money, you know nada
Tell me where I'm gonna play for
I'm in the stupid crib and he's paid for
With whips and chains like a slave bone
Grind on time, grind on time
I don't need a pass cause I know the boy
I got lines on lines, lines on lines
Border raps like corduroys
Yeah, that's your girl and you take her on trips
But I take her home and I'm making her strip
I got paper for show, and I'm making it flip till I'm [?]

[Chorus: Price]
See I made it of the block way
I don't talk, they just do it
Now we celebrate a way to bring a bottle of fluid
Yeah, I started in the kitchen, now we're strapping every week
And wasn't worried about the niggas who was clapping in the streets
Cause they were with me (the long way)
I'm getting money (the long way)
I'm in the streets (the long way)
Them women love me (the long way)
They were with me (the long way)
I'm getting money (the long way)
I'm in the streets (the long way)
Them women love me (the long way)

[Verse 2: Oktane]
Alright, now Hit-boy on the  baseline
Louis V on my waist line
You've been with your girl like seven months
I hit that like 8 times
That's once a month, don't average
?one month, I got savage
She told you, is that time of month
And that's probably right when I had it!
I'm hammer boy, you can't touch me
Because I don't speak nothing but heat
And I'm a Little Rascal, I'll take your girl if I wave at her, Buckwheat
If you ain't rocking my way, then you're probably rolling the wrong way
And your girl my love too short, but she's rocking with me long way

[Chorus: Price]
See I made it of the block way
I don't talk, they just do it
Now we celebrate a way to bring a bottle of fluid
Yeah, I started in the kitchen, now we're strapping every week
And wasn't worried about the niggas who was clapping in the streets
Cause they were with me (the long way)
I'm getting money (the long way)
I'm in the streets (the long way)
Them women love me (the long way)
They were with me (the long way)
I'm getting money (the long way)
I'm in the streets (the long way)
Them women love me (the long way)

[Verse 3: Hit-Boy]
Me and my niggers just fine
Cause we're good fellows
Always be ready to ride
Ain't shit you could tell us
HS my side like I live next to a high school
I got wet girls all in my pool
Let me drew the shit like a park tour
She treat my dick like a driver
Look at that, that's a lot
Like 2 Chainz, no lie bruh
We go hard no problem
Keep goblin' and garglin',  give me all.. she can't [?]
In my life like a mosh pit, you can't fuck with this squadron

[Chorus: Price]
See I made it of the block way
I don't talk, they just do it
Now we celebrate a way to bring a bottle of fluid
Yeah, I started in the kitchen, now we're strapping every week
And wasn't worried about the niggas who was clapping in the streets
Cause they were with me (the long way)
I'm getting money (the long way)
I'm in the streets (the long way)
Them women love me (the long way)
They were with me (the long way)
I'm getting money (the long way)
I'm in the streets (the long way)
Them women love me (the long way)
