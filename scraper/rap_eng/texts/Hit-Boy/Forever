[Intro]
Oh, forever, oh
Oh, forever, oh
Oh, forever, oh
Oh, forever (Clutch)
Forever

[Verse 1]
You could stop the clock, that wouldn't be time enough
You could let the night turn to morning
I still would be wanting more of your love
There just ain't enough days in a week (Week)
Weeks in a month (Month), months in a year
How can I make it clear?

[Pre-Chorus]
(I wanna be with you) I wanna be with you
(And feel the heat with you) And feel the heat with you
(I'm flying, I'm weightless) I'm floating in the distance
(Don't rush it, be patient) I'm gonna stop the hands of time, I will

[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever, we could do it forever
I could do this forever, I could do this forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever

[Verse 2]
Give me all your life, and I'd ask you for even more
You can't offer me a part of your body
'Cause honestly (Honestly), it's just not enough anymore
Let's get lost in the moment
You know you want it, what you waiting for?

[Pre-Chorus]
(I wanna be with you) I wanna be with you
(And feel the heat with you) And feel the heat with you
(I'm flying, I'm weightless) I'm floating in the distance
(Don't rush it, be patient) I'm gonna stop the hands of time, I will

[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever, we could do it forever
I could do this forever, I could do this forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever

[Bridge]
Can you tell me what it is you're waiting for?
Can you tell me what it is? 'Cause I don't know
(Let's go) Come on, baby, just take my hand
(Let's go) Why you looking like you don't understand?
(Let's go) That's it, I'ma make this easy
(Let's go) And that ain't me, believe me, but just

[Chorus]
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever, we could do it forever
I could do this forever, I could do this forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever

[Outro]
Let's go forever, forever, forever, forever
Let's go forever, forever, forever, forever
Let's go forever, forever, forever, forever
Let's go forever, forever, forever, forever
Let's go forever, forever, forever, forever
Let's go
