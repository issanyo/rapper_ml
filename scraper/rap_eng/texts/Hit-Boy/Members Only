[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Now all these bitches wanna say hi, I just wanna stay high
They be poppin' up at parties, the parties happened to be mine
And it's alright cause look
Don't mind me I'm just young and excited
Getting used to the feeling of being invited
And I'm kinda loose off the gin, the chronic and tonic
Most of these women know that I produced, watched and learned from Rihanna
If I got my words right I'll hit on the first night
Now you know my nerves bad like most black people on their first flight
Or like your favorite artist spazzing on their first mic
Or like a mother that's giving birth to a first life
It's love at first sight, like your first Mike's
Or your favorite pair of Fendi's in the city
Of confused career paths and fucked up love lives
I'll never regret that, I know that at one time
It was exactly what I wanted but part of my struggle was my pride is too humongous
This performance is a triumph, a ceremony of struggle ten down til we double

[Hook: Hit-Boy & James Fauntleroy]
This is something I've been wishing for every night shit (Ooooh, it's like that)
This is something I've been waiting for my whole life shit (Ooooh, it's like that)
Only real niggas and bad bitches invited, Members Only (Fireworks)
Only real niggas and bad bitches invited, Members Only, Members Only (And if you trynna light that, Firework)
(And maybe you should try that)

[Verse 2: Oktane]
Ha look
Don't mind me I'm just smoking and rapping
I woke up here nigga I don't know how it happened
Last thing I remember I was in Colton just rapping
I remember when members only was only a jacket
I remember Chauncey and Tony right after my classics
And then Tony start acting funny, and Chauncey start rapping
Me, him and Chili Chil run away to the mills traffic
Then it got really real when life got really crackin'
Cause money and hunnys got all these niggas funny acting

[Verse 3: Price]
I guess that's just a reaction when all them funds distract them
But look, don't mind me I ain't looking for pity
I just lost two homies and my cousin City
Looking at this thing we call life trynna grab a grip
Suicidal thoughts, I never thought I'd have them shits
Sharing the whole bag of chips walking home, You & I
Flirting with them bitches we would chirp on that I-205
When it was beef you would ride, when I was hurt you would cry
Me and you was unified, me and you was that do or die
But what do I do when you die, I close my eyes and I find myself lonely
Pray to Christ, I like this vice, and mourn cause I miss my homies

[Hook: Hit-Boy & James Fauntleroy]

[Verse 4: B Mac The Queen]
Don't mind me I'm just here for the veggies
I mean that carrot, spinach, celery, lettuce
I mean that gotta get it, and never say never
I swear that the ghetto made it so easy to let go
When I was born my Momma yelling, "Now she gonna be special"
And now I'm pointing out what I want like it's easy to get those
Even the best hoes, my weed and my fresh clothes relieving my stress bro
And I'll be good for a month until it's time to re-up
I gotta get mines nigga what

[Verse 5: Kent M$NEY]
Memoirs of a youngin' torn between ball and rap
Embracing all these strangers, time told me they were more than that
Hit saw the map, Quarterbacked what I was becoming quick
And always stuck together all the time we was over shit
We ain't have much paper but always figured out how
And everybody racing to be your nigga now
It's still the same some niggas came and they went
It's more respect if you stay and you vent
As far as messages sent
It's still love let em know you still the homie
But this right here for Members Only

[Hook: Hit-Boy & James Fauntleroy]

[Outro: K. Roosevelt]
This is something I've been wishing for every night shit
Only real niggas and bad bitches invited, Members Only
(This is something I've been wishing for every night shit
This is something I've been waiting for my whole life shit
Real niggas and bad bitches invited (X3))
