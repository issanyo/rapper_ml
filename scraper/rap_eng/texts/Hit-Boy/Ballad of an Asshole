[Verse 1]
Asshole, yeah that’s what they calling me
And they can watch the time fly
While they wait on an apology
D.F.Y., D.F.Y., that’s the story of my life
They always told me don’t speak
If you ain’t saying nothing nice
Attitude over everything, everything over my exes
Everyone stays for dinner
Only the chosen stay for breakfast
Sorry, I’m not sorry
Came in tardy to the party, dressing, acting like I’m Ari
They ask me why I’m conceited
And why I’m over-achieving
People done fucked me over
So really I’m just getting even
There’s a price on my head, I’m going for dead
‘Cause nobody cares about me
I’ve been way too self-involved, I guess it’s my fault
Maybe we’ll just have to wait and see
And you know...
As I'm living, I dont stress ‘em, I God bless ‘em
Learned that lesson, now I’m better
I’m walking into confession
One shot for my people
Who never made it up out the ghetto
To get through this shit
I’m gon’ need another shot of espresso

[Hook]
Fuck ‘em all is what I’m yellin’ ‘til I die
Did it all on my own, I’m doin’ what I fantasized
Might have hurt a couple feelings, but I never told no lies
And the nerve of these folks, they want me to apologize?
I’m sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, I’m not
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I’m not
Sorry for stuntin’, sorry for nothin’
Sorry for what? Sorry, I’m not sorry

[Verse 2]
Asshole, why the fuck you callin’ me?
Said it ‘cause I had to, that wasn’t a real apology
Scorpio my astrology, tardiness is my policy
“Lived a man, died a legend” someday will be my biography
Living and loving and learning, watching the world as it’s turning
They say that this is just murder, please let me call my attorney
Dudes, what about ‘em? See boyfriends are like assholes
Every girl’s got one, it’s just that we don’t want to hear about ‘em
I’m in London and Paris, stunt and embarrass, shopping at Harrod’s
Seeing an heiress, she lies to parents, she’s running my errands
And wondering why I dont want to get married
‘Cause I don’t give a fuck, don’t give a fuck
(Won’t you tell ‘em like)
I dont give a fuck, don’t give a fuck
In love and war there are no rules and no regulations
No judges, no congregations
No hugs and no conversations
No love and no consummation
Stop letting my confidence expose all your insecurities
And you wonder why nothing worries me
(Thought I told ‘em, you know)

[Hook]

[Outro]
I told him, “real men never ask for help”
He turned to me and said, “son, don’t flatter yourself”
I told him, “real men never ask for help”
He turned to me and said, “son, don’t flatter yourself”
