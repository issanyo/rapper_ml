[Intro: Lil Twist]
Yeah, Rich Gang
Big Homie, check, look

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
Fly nigga in a pair of Louis tennis shoes (woo)
In the club, where the ratio is 10 to 2 (damn)
Bad chick been in this bitch from like 10 to 2 (damn)
She thinkin' interview, but I’m thinkin' gettin' into you
To the VIP lounge, is where we take it boo (let's go)
She taking clothes off and shit, I'm gettin' naked too (huh)
She say she got a couple rules
I'm tryna break a few then (damn)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & (Lil Twist)]
She says she dreams about me all the time (yeah)
And where she dreamed it would be, is here, tonight (that's right)
I told her she was a freak, for tonight (huh? Woo!)
She said that don’t bother me, I said let’s do it in the VIP, yeah (yeah, haha)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She said I don’t care, I don’t care, I don’t care so (care, care, care, so)
I don’t care, I don’t care, I don’t care no (care, care, care, so)
I don’t care, I don’t care, I don’t care so (care, care, care, so)
She says she’ll do anything for a superstar

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]
Haha, yeah, freak 'em dress on, sexy girl attitude (woo, huh)
She got a swag like she shop on Fifth Avenue (yeah)
And I can see it in your eyes, you an animal
What’s your zodiac sign? Are we compatible?
Girl, you the one for the night, at least I think so (uh)
Back of the club where the paparazzi can’t go (nah)
She bend over, put her hands on her ankles
Then

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & (Lil Twist)]
She says she dreams about me all the time (haha, yeah)
And where she dreamed it would be, is here, tonight (Young Money, Rich Gang)
I told her she was a freak, for tonight (Wild Kids)
She said that don’t bother me, I said let’s do it in the VIP, yeah (I said, woo!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Twist]
She said I don’t care, I don’t care, I don’t care so (care, care, care, so) (c'mon)
I don’t care, I don’t care, I don’t care no (care, care, care, so)  (this that shit right here)
I don’t care, I don’t care, I don’t care so (care, care, care, so) (I don't care so)
She says she’ll do anything for a superstar (let's go, talk to 'em)

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Lil Twist]
Girl, you’re my masterpiece, you’re my art (yeah)
Shine like a diamond, beauty so priceless, girl (baby)

I'm gonna love you, baby, don’t worry (uh-huh)
And if you're ready, I'ma give my all right now, girl (yeah)
Baby, come over so we can make love, girl, this is all yours

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She said I don’t care, I don’t care, I don’t care so (baby)
I don’t care, I don’t care, I don’t care no (yeah, oh, oh)
I don’t care, I don’t care, I don’t care so (I just wanna get you)
She says she’ll do anything for a superstar (I just wanna get you, oh, nigga)
