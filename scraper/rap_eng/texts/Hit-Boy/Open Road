[Hook]
Zoomin' on an open road, open road
I got everywhere to go, where to go
Put the pedal to the floor, I smash, 100 miles on the dash
Gotta get to my cash, nigga don't be mad
On an open road, open road
I got everywhere to go, where to go
Put the pedal to the floor, I smash, 100 miles on the dash
Gotta get to my cash, nigga don't be mad

[Verse 1]
Bitch I won't hang with your thang if she only average
Need some brain from a thang that look like Zoë Kravitz
My campaign never change, I pull up in traffic
Get out the way, stay in your lane, don't be, don't be mad, bitch
My campaign never change, I pull up in traffic
Need some brain from a thang that look like Zoë Kravitz
I won't hang with your thang if she only average
Get out the way, stay in your lane, don't be, don't be mad, bitch
This a ghetto classic, fuck your antics
I'm adding up my mathematics like I'm on campus
From sleeping on a couch at Cannon's playing the Fantom
The first one woke, only one way to go

[Hook]
Zoomin' on an open road, open road
I got everywhere to go, where to go
Put the pedal to the floor, I smash, 100 miles on the dash
Gotta get to my cash, nigga don't be mad
On an open road, open road
I got everywhere to go, where to go
Put the pedal to the floor, I smash, 100 miles on the dash
Gotta get to my cash, nigga don't be mad
Zoomin' on an open road, open road
I got everywhere to go, where to go
Put the pedal to the floor, I smash, 100 miles on the dash
Gotta get to my cash, nigga don't be mad
On an open road, open road
I got everywhere to go, where to go
Put the pedal to the floor, I smash, 100 miles on the dash
Gotta get to my cash, nigga don't be mad

[Verse 2]
When you see me fuckin' up a check in public don't be mad
When I see your face, you lookin' up, said damn, don't be mad
Pull up in that ooh, your ho like ooh damn, don't be mad
When I pull a U on you, nigga, don't be mad
Neck full of gold, talkin' like you got it
Everybody know you don't, my pimp game too strong
I will never fold, zoomin' on the open road
Blowin' smoke out the window
You don't want much, well I want more
I want a spaceship filled with 8 10s I can play with
Weed and crustaceans on my plate and I'll be A okay
They say better late than never, bitch I'm never late
Get it straight, day to day
State to day, I'm cruisin'

[Hook]
Zoomin' on an open road, open road
I got everywhere to go, where to go
Put the pedal to the floor, I smash, 100 miles on the dash
Gotta get to my cash, nigga don't be mad
Zoomin' on an open road, open road
I got everywhere to go, where to go
Put the pedal to the floor, I smash, 100 miles on the dash
Gotta get to my cash, nigga don't be mad

[Outro]
Don't be mad
Don't be mad
Don't be mad
Don't-don't be mad
Don't-don't-don't be mad
Don't-don't be mad
Don't-don't be
