[Verse 1]
I ain't gettin' no younger
So boy, when I say love
I don't say it just to say love
I know better
If you never showed love
Don't think I woulda known love
Gotta put it in my song, love
And sing it over and over

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told my mother that I love ya
My brother asked me where I met ya
Said I saw you last Tuesday
On the corner of 1st and Love
I heard ya whistling my favorite song
When I saw ya that morning on the corner of 1st and Love

[Chorus]
Right there, right there, oh
And I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there, right there
On the corner of 1st and Love

[Verse 2]
My heart is beating like a bass drum
I heard Cupid in my ear
He said he never saw better
I gave him a straight shot
And it hit me like a moving truck
I howled like an animal
But it never felt so good

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I told my mother that I love ya
Bridgett asked me where I met ya
Said I saw you last Tuesday
On the corner of 1st and Love
I heard ya whistling my favorite song
When I saw ya that morning on the corner of 1st and Love

[Chorus]
Right there, right there, oh
And I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there, right there
On the corner of 1st and Love

[Bridge]
This ain't serendipity, no
I know that it's meant to be love
Don't feel like luck to me, no
Know that it had to be love

[Verse 3]
Like our names carved on a tree
The memories inside of me
Don't know how long forever is
Would you stay with me and find out with me?
Oh, if the sun don't rise for weeks
Baby, that's alright with me
I can't add to infinity
But if you stay with me, you can count on me

[Chorus]
Right there, right there, oh
And I wanna sing it to the world
He's right there, right there
On the corner of 1st and Love

[Outro]
I saw you by the street signs
Oh I, I saw you by the street signs
They read 1st and Love
Love, love, love
