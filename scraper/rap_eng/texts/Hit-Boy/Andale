(Verse 1:)
Someday I'ma run away
From those who darken my day
And make me wanna say
That there’s no way
I'ma stay put
Gotta input
My simple single saying
You better be straying
Cause I'm laying bars
And I'm goin' far
And you're just barring yourself behind
Better rewind
Before I make you see my behind (hehe)
Three mimes talk shit
But can’t spit
Only say it
When they on some shit
Other words
They unheard
On their social world, (haters)
But they antisocial though
See me then they call me bro (woah!)
Ever since day one all I do is drop hits
And you better call me when you think that someone here (hah!) can top this
Just got a raise I'ma cop kicks
Like Sriracha rhymes are hot shit (spice)
And make that cherry pop quick
Im'a ace that shit like pop quiz (A)

(Chorus:)
I'm on beat pretty much every day
On repeat, all of the words I say
Got a receipt for each quarter, ayy
Fast release, shit goes Andale

I'm on beat pretty much every day
On repeat, all of the words I say
Got a receipt for each quarter, ayy
Fast release, shit goes Andale

(Verse 2:)
Blast my shit in your car then you call that shit 'automob-ill'
I came on the bitch like oil spill
Deadbeat, got you with a cold kill
Better hold still
Cause you seem so thrilled
Damn, I better stop dropping cuz all of my shit is overkill
Better keep your girl away from ye
Cause just like Ford, she must hang with me
And she wants me to explore her, please
Back in summer see dis'
Shit ain’t like you see it
Cause if you may back away
From my game, cause fame
Is lame, till you gain
A Lamborghini
Ayy
What a shame, you the same
As everyone else in the game
I proclaim I'm sane
But the pain, engraved (woah, woah)
Got you plain, in a grave (woah, woah)

(Chorus:)
I'm on beat pretty much every day
On repeat, all of the words I say
Got a receipt for each quarter, ayy
Fast release, shit goes Andale

I'm on beat pretty much every day
On repeat, all of the words I say
Got a receipt for each quarter, ayy
Fast release, shit goes Andale
