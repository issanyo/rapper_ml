[Verse 1]
I've lost my temperature
Where have all my sunny days gone?
Is there any place to stay warm?
It's not easy when you're gone
Tell me how I'm supposed to go on
Right now I don't wanna be strong

[Pre-Chorus]
With the rain, comes more pain
You never know, damn the weather
Hard to hide, when I cry
This pain inside ain't getting better
Body shakes, I feel so numb, numb
I'm shivering, why did you go?

[Chorus]
My body is froze, every part of me cold
My heart's aching and I can't breathe
My soul's breaking, minus 31 degrees
Nowhere else to go, froze

[Verse 2]
My heart struggles to beat, yeah, I need a life line
And I would rather die before I
Start to freeze, yeah
Live my life in fear, no way

[Pre-Chorus]
With the rain, comes more pain
You never know, damn the weather
Hard to hide, when I cry
This pain inside ain't getting better
Body shakes, I feel so numb
I'm shivering, why did you go?

[Chorus]
My body is froze, it's froze, every part of me cold, yeah, yeah
My heart's aching and I can't breathe, breathe
My soul's breaking, minus 31 degrees, degrees
Nowhere else to go, froze

[Bridge]
I am so cold, my body's frozen
I am so cold, frozen
Froze, froze, froze, froze
Cold, cold
My body is froze, my body is froze
Cold, my body is froze, my body is froze

[Chorus]
My body is froze, froze, every part of me cold, but there's gotta be a better way, yeah
My heart's aching and I can't breathe, I can't
My soul's breaking, minus 31 degrees, 31 degrees, yeah
Nowhere else to go, froze
My body is froze, it is frozen 'cause you're gone, yeah, every part of me cold
My heart's aching and I can't breathe, can't breathe
My soul's breaking, minus 31 degrees, degrees, yeah
Nowhere else to go, froze
