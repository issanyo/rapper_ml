[Intro: Sean Leon]
Everytime I spazz and I vent
It is a rapping event
And I am spazzing again
Niggas is capping again
Capping like Jazz was back then
But you know what happened to him
Actors
Meanwhile I'm backin 'em in
Big bags in the back of the van
Racks, and I'm backin 'em in
Do not try that in my ends (Parkdale Cartel)
My ends, my ends till the very end
Parkdale Cartel

[Verse 1: Sean Leon]
Today I plea for peace, I prayed on it
But I know if I don't keep that piece
They gon' prey on me
Leave my body broken in the street
Mid-day and shit
Have my blood soaking up the street
Like it was painting it
Black truck, I came in it
Uber driver black too
If he got an aux cord
I'll make that man a fan too
Five stars hop out, summertime clock
I see cop cars, guns out
Helicopters watch, circle blocks like daycare
Turning boys to men put on this block
We don't play fair
If they come with straps
I'm coming back like shaved hair
Live fast, stay rare
Make a lane, stay there
Police come and raid here
I was on the steps, just watching
Plotting my steps
Something said I'm next
Bullets playing tag
While you making threats
Razer blade at your neck
Posted on the net, with a filter for effect
I took that disrespect
And made these hoes respect me
They love me like I'm Gretzky
Cashing cheques, in and out the bank
Trust me (Nobody is safe)
On a wave

[Verse 2: Jordan Fall]
They running they mouth, chasing the sound
But lost in the wave, I'm fucking her face
She swallow my kids, licking her lips
To see what it taste, blowing on dank
Run up a cheque and flip it again
To raise up the rank, decided my fate
Down for the shits, living the risk
But filling the safe
On the up and up, they be praying on our downfall
Squares up in your circle, can't spend no time around y'all
New shit shake the ground dawg, they don't wanna sound off
Only time we feel your shit is when we got the sound off
