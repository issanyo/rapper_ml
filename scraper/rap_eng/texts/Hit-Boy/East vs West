This that shit y'all been missing
This that shit y'all don't hear no more
This that shit that Nas was kicking
The shit that BIG would've spit the night before

[Verse 1]
...He was murdered, probably sitting with Puff in Fatburger
Thinking of some ill shit nobody ever heard of
Discussing studio time and interviews with Word Up
Cali bitches hitting him but he ain't getting worked up
His mama probably worried about him
She ain't know about Suge, or she heard about him
But he said it was all good, he was going courtside to watch the Lakers
Forgetting about the niggas tryna stick him for his paper
Rich and famous, Shakur died, Bad Boy who they blaming
Not even knowing the direction of the finger they aiming is the wrong one
Soon enough they'll find out in the long run
But still he ended up on the other side of the wrong gun
Seeing palm trees, through Versace shades
Not even knowing his life after death would start today
Tire marks from the Goodyear swerving
From the 7 shots fired in the side of the suburban, rest in peace

This that shit y'all been missing
This that shit y'all don't hear no more
This that shit that Snoop was kicking
The shit that Pac would've spit the night before

[Verse 2]
...He was murdered at the red light, tryna get his head right
Tryna shake the beef, probably tryna get his bread right
Before his time run out, before them guns come out
Playing another album we ain't heard that's finna come out
Wondering who to trust, there's rumors and shit on TV
Only person telling it like it is is Afeni
A demon to the media, a angel in the booth
He was poetic seeking justice, plus he had the juice
America's most wanted with ambitions as a rider
Screaming hail Mary while throwing the west side up
Shots hit the door, he was hit when the glass shattered
To live in die in LA, couldn't happen in Nevada
Slumped in that BM Dub, Suge had to sit him up
Then they wanna blame it on that first line in "Hit Em Up"
Overlooking who they was thumping and chasing
Who knew that that altercation would lead to his expiration, rest in peace

This that shit y'all been missing

The shit that Nate would've sung the night before
Rest in peace
