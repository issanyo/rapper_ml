[Intro: Tinashe]
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
What you lookin' at now baby?
Won't you use your mind, oh
I been on a long ride, baby
Can't do a sober drive, no
Found love in November nights
Cold weather in the winter time, oh, woah
Guess you know when the time is right
Let's go on a little joyride, oh

[Chorus: Tinashe (with Travis Scott)]
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Tell me what you lookin' at baby?
Been in this club for a long time, no
Need another shot now baby (la, la)
Roll another joint, let go
I been rock and rollin' with my ex
We be gettin' closer to the x
We be always poppin' like the ex
Crossin' out the haters with the x

[Chorus: Tinashe (with Travis Scott)]
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Bridge: Tinashe (with Travis Scott)]
Told me what you lookin' at, oh
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, yeah, oh
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Don't watch me, don't watch me
Don't watch me, don't watch me
Don't watch me
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Living life la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Outro: Travis Scott]
They don't know, know, know, know
Story goes, I don't know
Story goes, I don't know, oh, oh, oh
Sorry though, sorry though, sorry though
I don't know
Don't watch me, don't watch me
Watch me, don't watch me
Yeah, story goes, I don't know
Story goes, I don't know
