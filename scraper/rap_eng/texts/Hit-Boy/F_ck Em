[Verse 1]
I know you wanna hear new shit
But at the same time you gonna push out the new kid
Shit, I know its hard to accept it
But if you don't get it in the future you'll regret it
I can be the one you wanna fuck up
Been at the bottom, and I guess its tough luck
Well whats up? I don't think I'll ever stop
They said its not my time, so I'm fucking with the clock
And that is how it supposed to be
I'm walking around these streets so hopelessly
I hope they notice me! I hope they understand!
My futures darker than a tunnel, but I got a plan
Just take my hand, and I'm a lift you up
No matter what I say I'm never gonna give you up
I guess I miss you huh, like I never have
And when the worlds on display I'm a take a grab

[Hook]
Fuck Em, They know I'll never love em
I breathe gasoline till I fly right above em
I don't trust em, I'm never gonna trust em
They can run their fucking mouths all I gotta say is fuck fm
Fuck em, fuck em

[Verse 2]
Stop fucking fronting stop fucking fronting
And when you see my face you ain't never saying nothing
Stop fucking fronting stop fucking fronting
I know you won't like it when I blow and be something
I'm just telling the truth son
You won't believe what I'm about to become
It's begun and you know I'm never stopping
Until I'm face up lying dead in a coffin
I gotcha but you will never get me
Your whole life you won't never forget me
You never met me, I'm just a fucking ghost
I'm a haunt you until you fucking cut your thout
You can bet I won't, but I'm a be there
I'm a come like a wave so you can be scared
And be prepared, for when I finally blow
I'm headed for the the top and it's my time to go

[Hook]
