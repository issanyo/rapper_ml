[Hook: Stacy Barthe]

Running in place and going nowhere fast

Running in vain how long will this last

Running in place, running in vain

Running in place, how long will it take


[Verse 1]

Feeling like my back’s against the wall

But lately this shit been feeling invisible

‘Cause when you born to rise

All these bitches weren’t to visit you

All them niggers who hate it

Congratulate pretending to be in your corner

But the truth is they never be free to choose

Accepting all the times

Welcoming in the poles

But the ship feel like it sink

Where your heroes become your foes

Then your dreams become your life

And you still got room to grow

Relate to my pain, I’m spilling my soul

I just feel like I change school

And niggers like Hova flashing

And I can’t score niggers like Ye with fashion

But I can score niggers don’t have is the passion

‘Cause I remember being 3 wondering where my dad went

The letters he has sent, motivating me on my path

Taking in prison visits putting my hand on the glass

When is daddy coming home is the question I never ask
I’m a titan and here’s the part where I clash

I just feel like I’m


[Bridge: Stacy Barthe]

Running in place


[Verse 2]

They thought I was done but they was so wrong

And I was so young and stuck in that zone

They thought I was gone
But when I got grown I stuck to my name

And I made it my own

My pops was from quibble

Their pops was from ABC

But I just made great music
So I’m G, DOUBLE O, D. They

Never really expect for this shit to come out of me

Just the real last nigga, that’s something I’m proud to be

Honestly I can see we all got room to grow

Relate to my pain, I’m spilling my soul

I just feeling like I’m


[Hook]


[Outro]

If I gotta leave then I’ma leave you with this

If you gonna dream, dream big

And if you gonna live, live right

‘Cause we never get the chance to do it twice
