[Verse 1]
I'm ain't gonna treat you like you're my number one
I'mma treat you like you're my only one
Cause you're the only one
That I be holding on
You're the only reason that I wrote this song
And that I wrote this chorus up on the keys
And you just hit me right now
Saying "If I miss you like you miss me"
And the answer is yes and it seems
They say the one that you love and the one that loves you back
Are rarely the same person but I guess we changing that
Cause I got this beautiful dream in this bottle
You're a beautiful girl, model
You've been trying to keep my heart cause it's worth ten times what they bought you
You deserve a beat from me and I ain't talking music shit
I'm talking face down ass up I know you used to it
I can picture you never you so thick
And those shoes you used to fit
You're replaced with red bottoms and black cars from niggas you used to hit
And that kind of make me reluctant
You the kind of girl I want to fuck with
But I'm moving world-wide and you on couches on that fuck shit
You know Sean you know Chris
You know Pusha you know Hit
But if ain't clubs and studios than
You don't know shit

[Hook]
I promise that she the one I adore
She damn near have everything that I was looking for
But she was from L.A
She was from L.A. (3x)
She crushed my heart on the floor
But she the one I adore
She damn near have everything that I was looking for
But she was from L.A
She was from L.A. (3x)
And she belongs to the city

[Verse 2]
I wish you would act right
But you taking all these first class flights
In a different time-zone last night
You swear you not giving up ass, right?
You going to blame it on cash right?
And I'm telling you I'm not askin'
You're single in the summer cause that's when all the parties happen
Look at me
Keep it G
You're just trying to fuck a winner huh
And you going to turn around and want a man a winner huh
Talking to me about that point guard on the bench
But when a nigga give the keys to that Benz
All the sudden ya'll the shit
BBM status ain't matching all these phone conversations
This powerhouse is ? songs all on his station
And so and so is in town and your homegirls friends with one of his neighbors
And he fooled you all around and you swear you ain't returning no favors
Now you drunk BBM'ing me rambling on and on and
You seeing that I'm reading it but you know I'm not responding
Girl I swear I hate this game and I always wonder who's teaching you
Charged your phone all day but after one you're just unreachable
