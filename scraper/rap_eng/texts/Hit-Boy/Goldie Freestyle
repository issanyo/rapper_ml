[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Yo, yo, bitch I crowd surf and throw it on tv
Ain't no way you niggas can't see me
My beats alone deserve five mics
Five lifes, I swear I'm livin' a fuckin' highlight
All them hoes you dream about is up in my jacuzzi
They comin' over, actin' up, we 'bout to make a movie
I swear for God, man that shit ain't really nothin' to me
Other type of Jesus is Givenchy, I ain't wearin' Gucci
Dinin' with dons and dickin' divas is my M-O
Knew I was a king since niggas was rockin' my Massimo
In '94, young and broke, now I'm at the top chillin'
Hits all on the radio, I'm fuckin' my own Robin Givens
Tyson of this beat shit, rhymes on the top tier
You, failure, and floppin' is just somethin' I do not fear
Won't stop, not soon, 'til I'm like a tycoon
All your hoes, they see me they get wetter than a monsoon

[Hook] x2
Said it must be cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a chest full of gold
All around the globe everybody know
That we gon' get this paper 'til it ain't no more

[Verse 2: Audio Push]
Ridin', ridin', all my niggas is ridin'
No...duckin' no hidin', no chuckin' that chopper
We buckin' and slidin', we gettin' the paper you see ?
You niggas ain't shinin' you niggas is lyin'
Ask around, they'll tell you how I'm evil-sided
These niggas know I ball, no refs ain't no foul
Verses I Gasol, no Lakers no Pau
God is all I trust and Hit-Boy all on the percussion
Excuse all of this stuckin', but these youngin's came from nothin'
Like zero, nothin', nada, I rap game, I'm your poppa
Hit-Boy says, "Start it up" and now nobody can stop us
See first they try and knock us, but now you see that we poppin'
So you shut up, you sit down, you kick back, and you watch us
Like tv, cause HB is that 2-3 and I'm 3-3
That's MJ and that's SP, that's oh yeah that's three-peat
Six rings, at least, you rappers won't beat a nigga
HS87 playin' when you see these niggas

[Hook]

[Outro]
HS87
It's G.O.O.D. music nigga
Surf club, surf club
Bow, bow, bow, bow
Bitch, this how we do it
It's a motherfuckin' young nigga movement
Goddamn we goin' stupid
Yeah, yeah, bounce
