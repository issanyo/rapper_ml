[Verse 1]
My whip is raw
I'm cruising bumpin Tim McGraw
Usually fuck fat hoes but just dicked the slimmest broad
And after six minutes of hittin' raw
I pulled out and busted on the toilet seat and made the bitch lick it off
Looking for my mind but I'm pretty sure the shit is gone
Turned my car on and now my lips is locked with its exhaust
Inhale then begin to cough
Wake up mummified in my tomb like an Egyptian god
When I die bury me inside a pyramid
With ten chains on in a casket with a clear lid
So when I'm discovered they can come inside and peer in it
And see the evidence that young Trebion was clearly rich
I'm writin this verse at 2:30 and I'm tired as shit
It took me a while to get inspired a bit
But once I got the tools for the fire it lit
And now I'm serenading the beat like a choir kid bitch

[Hook]
This the hook, I hope it's really catchy
I hope it's catchy, I hope this hook is catchy
Umm, I hope this gets stuck in your head
This the hook, I hope it's really catchy

I hope it's really catchy, I hope it's a catchy hook
I hope it's really catchy
Umm, I'm really sexy
My voice is really sexy, I hope this hook is catchy

[Verse 2]
I'm screaming fuck the free world, 253
Gettin blew by three, blue eyed teens
These bitches put me way too highly
They be worshipping my cock on two dry knees
Reincarnation of Big L in '95
One hard ass nigga with a bag of syllables tryna rhyme
My kind of lines, have niggas finding time to buy my album while at work from a random site online
Bought a couple dubs even though ya boy is broke a lot
And I don't even toke a lot but every time I smoke some pot
Niggas got some shit to say, that's why I'm alone and not
Chilling with these other niggas blah blah blah

[Hook]
This the hook, I hope it's really catchy
I hope it's really catchy, I hope you like spaghetti
This the hook, I'm yelling like a yeti
Look at me umm...

I hope it's really catchy
I hope this hook is really really really catchy
Umm, my dog is fetching
I hope this hook is catchy, I hope it's catchy
