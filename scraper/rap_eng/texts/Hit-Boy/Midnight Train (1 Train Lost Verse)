My mom said that's too loud Aaron turn that down
Smoking on the roof of my house, plotting how to get out
While watching the stars and watching cars pass
These lyrics made from scratch, and cause a raw rash
But what's wrong with that?
If it sounds like crack and sizzles like it do
Only difference is this little kid cooked it up in the booth
Then why not try it 'til you overdo the dosage
They looking at me shocked like my flow has got a voltage
I've give you moments as I go in that may leave you saying "Oh shit
This guy is from the sky and yet he's deeper than the ocean
His sound it's so dope it's
Almost like you could hold it, then roll it, then smoke it"
Just watch how much you toke it
Better yet just watch the man who sold it to you
Been bumping this for a minute, how don't you know this mutant?
I'll introduce myself it's
Aarborne dude, and I keep a crew of moon men
We got some altitude so aim higher when you're shooting
Matter fact that still won't do it
You would have to strap some rockets to a rocket
Then as it gets up, guess what?
We still gon' stop it, need I remind these future bodies
That T.I. said it's Big Shit popping, and lil shit stopping
So theses guys are like E. coli to my eyes, so microscopic
Bringing offense that makes me laugh so hard I'm coughing
I'm like hop off it before I gotta drop somebody
Already got some jocks in coffins
Like I should bring back Biggie to make a song called "Who Shot 'Em?"
And in the lyrics give clues about the man who triggered the revolver
It's Aarborne bitch, I gotcha like Osama
I took the midnight train and never hopped off it
