[Verse 1: Brittany O'Grady, Jude Demorest]
Vibes been right all night
We could fall in love like this
We could fall in love like this
Let's take our time
Cause I'm feeling like
We could fall in love like this
We could fall in love like this

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Destiny]
Tomorrow's gonna be too rough
But tonight is gonna lift you up
That's what I believe
That's what I believe
You probably gonna think too much
But tonight we're gonna drink too much
That's what I believe
That's what I believe
I believe I can

[Chorus: Brittany O'Grady, Jude Demorest, Ryan Destiny]
Make somebody say (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Make somebody say (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Make somebody say (woah, woah, woah)
Make somebody say
You feel it when you're dancing with your hands up (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't worry 'bout a thing just let it all go (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know I can
Make somebody say (woah, woah, woah)
Make somebody say (woah, woah, woah)

[Verse 2: Brittany O'Grady, Jude Demorest]
Beat so loud, so loud
All I can think about is
We could make good love to this
We could make good love to this
Lost in the crowd
I found you and we're making out
They will never find a love to this
They will never find a love to this

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Destiny]
Tomorrow's gonna be too rough
But tonight is gonna lift you up
That's what I believe
That's what I believe
You probably gonna think too much
But tonight we're gonna drink too much
That's what I believe
That's what I believe
I believe I can

[Chorus: Brittany O'Grady, Jude Demorest, Ryan Destiny]
Make somebody say (yeah, yeah, yeah)
