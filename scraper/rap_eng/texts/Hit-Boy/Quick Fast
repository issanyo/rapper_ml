[Hook: Price]
I'm the man and you gon' know quick fast
If I sell it, it's gon' go quick fast
I just might finesse yo' ho quick fast
Tell that bitch to drop it low quick fast
See I done came up with the bros quick fast
Drop this and we gon' blow quick fast
Tell a hater run my dough quick fast
So we can shine around the globe quick fast

[Verse 1: Oktane]
Yeah, I like this...l-look
See I can make yo' girl move three ways: slow, quick, fast
I like that so keep that tempo like that
Finesse, finesse now ya whole clique sad
But if I tell my boys go then the whole clique blast
It be me, Price, Esso, Nno, Roose, Hit, Cas
That ain't half the clique
You take a look, we take a pic
You take a pic, we double tap
Ain't no gram, ain't no likes
I got stripes, I need a tank
I.E., we to the bank
I'm the man you gon know

[Verse 2: Price]
Stop the beat and dim the lights (quick fast)
Give me the mic (quick fast)
Ask her who it is and she gon' tell you Price (quick fast)
Pass the dice (quick fast)
I'm known to strike (quick fast)
Young nigga extra'd out I got my stripes (quick fast)
So get that purple po' and mix it with the Sprite (quick fast)
Get some purple dro, make sure you roll it tight (quick fast)
For every nigga round me, I'll give my life (quick fast)
She got a nice thick ass, then she might get smashed
They call me bishop P Teezy I talk the game like I know it
My OG told me "be easy, stay from them streets, you a poet"
I said fasho and got on it
Put the city on I'm feeling heroic
My red bone drop it the lowest
I'm the man and you gon know, nigga

[Hook: Price]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Wale!
Wussup, mmm
Aye, muy rápido
What's up with that sloppy doe?
High as E. Guerrero dropping elbow off that toppy rope
Mmm. I just stab a ho
Jewelry make her wan’ go
Watch gave her change of heart
Cartier, cardio
Aye, slow down quick fast
Go down for a minute let me drown in that aye
I’m astoundin’ with that
Whole town bout to ask where you found him at
Look, soon as we hit the scene, we never get em’ to leave
Cover suites w/ freaks in John Elliott tees
Blowin’ regular weed
That’s how it get when you G
I know some chicks that probably blow their scholarship
On the weave, believe me
