[Intro: Sample]
"Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation
Obviously a major malfunction"

[Verse 1]
Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I’m crashing into you
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Baby, love me lights out

[Chorus]
In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
Search through the crowd (Search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I've given you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
(XO)
You can turn my lights out

[Verse 2]
We don’t have forever
Baby, daylight’s wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time has run out
Nobody sees what we see
They’re just hopelessly gazing
Baby, take me
Before they turn the lights out
Before our time has run out
Baby, love me lights out

[Chorus]
In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

[Bridge]
I love you like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me boy XO
You love me like XO
All that I see
Give me everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

[Chorus]
In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out
