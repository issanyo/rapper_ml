[Verse 1]
Yeah, shit I'm going through a lot
Art Basel night out but I'm caught up in the spot
Left the Pigalle party, I'm in the crib tryna plot
I can't even sleep, I'm tryna get the guap
I'm thinking all I need is a big tour with RiRi
And a couple more radio hits to get TV
Just hit Virgil to try to get Yeezy
He working on the album so it ain't gon' be easy
Damn, and my girl just caught a nigga
Rolled up unannounced she ain't even call a nigga
Seen shawty through my door and got in all her feelings
Going crazy, hope she don't get your boy evicted
Shit and I ain't even call them niggas
It's been a long time since I even talk to niggas
Couple childhood friends turned to awkward niggas
Cause when you get Benjamins there come in all the villains
More money, more problems, this shit is real life
The game is WCW real trife
Dumb, broke up with a good girl who had my back
Now it's gonna be hard to find a real wife
Time to deal with the snakes and all the fake loving
Why every time when she fuck me she always want somethin'?
Always asking 'bout "who's who?" and "who's that?"
And oh, I do's this, do you rap?
Opportunists are opportunists becoming fluent
Cleopatra in every factor, she never losin'
She will juice them until his empire come to ruins
Sometimes I think, "what the fuck am I doing?"
I'm strong but I'm only human
And my tolerance is low so I'm never using
Sometimes I wish Yams was never using
When we toured in UK I knew I'd lose him
Yeah, I know I'd lose him
He went to rehab the year before and he seen improvement
But the fame and access is what abused him
But he in heaven now and I know God'll use him
Yeah, I know God'll use him

[Hook]
Tatted angel, I'm cuffed to hell with diamond bangles
And this world is a whack bitch, she never faithful
She would fuck any rich nigga for diamond Jesus
If you wanna get in the game watch how she play you
Tatted angel, I'm cuffed to hell with diamond bangles
And this world is a whack bitch, she never faithful
She would fuck any rich nigga for diamond Jesus
If you wanna get in the game watch how she play you
Play you, play you, play you

[Verse 2]
Shit feeling too hard to get far
Feeling like a butterfly, shit, stuck in a glass jar
Wanna be the man, you gotta risk it all
Girlfriend's friends and even your good Lord
All the sacrifice got me thinking 'bout a vice
I wish my daddy was here to give me some advice
I’m thinking ‘bout Jamaica to live the rest of my life
Get money, leave the game and live me a new life
Shit, I could live me a new life
Disappear like Pac and marry a good wife
The pressure getting to me and all I can do is write
Giving back to my hood, hope what I'm doing is right
I know what I'm doing is right
I mean, what I'm doing is, like...
A couple Ferg health fears, few songs on the mic
Inspire these kids to change their wrongs to right
This is what I'm doing for life
What I'm pursuing in life
I'm suffering from survival's guilt
How I made it out the hood and how Noah got killed
Why my friends ain't make it and they so ambitious?
Why they get distracted by the parties and bitches?
Why I ain't get stuck doing the dishes?
At Ben and Jerry's, free scoops for the bitches
Went from ice cream to ice and creams
Gotta pinch myself cause I'm living the dream
But this life ain't all it seems
To get my nigga back, I give all these things
Yeah, Yamborghini, I know you see me, I know you see me
I know it's a couple little kids that wanna be me
I worked hard to get where I am, it ain't easy
Yeah, and this shit ain't easy

[Hook]
Tatted angel, I'm cuffed to hell with diamond bangles
And this world is a whack bitch, she never faithful
She would fuck any rich nigga for diamond Jesus
If you wanna get in the game watch how she play you
Play you, play you, play you

[Outro]
Sometimes I wish I wasn't famous
Sometimes I wish I wasn't famous
Wish I wasn't famous
Then I would know who's really by my side
Sometimes I wish I wasn't famous
Swear to God, I wish I wasn't famous
Oh, God, I wish I wasn't famous
Oh, God, I wish I wasn't famous
Maybe Yams would be here still with me
I swear this shit is killing me
I wish my nigga was here with me
I wish my nigga was here with me
