[Intro: Hit-Boy]
She gon' have to get that Half-A-Mil tatted...

[Refrain: Hit-Boy]
One hand on a whip
Just spend half a mil
Than I made it back
Made sure it's exact
Brought the party pack
Go 'head and crack the seal
Took that bitch to dealer
And she wasted half the mill

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Yeah, I ran out of trust
Niggas shooting loggs
Looking for that Mary J. Blige
Real love, real love, damn
Platinum skywalker in my lungs, uh
Seven minute trip to basement, 7K
Just put a new starter on my Chevrolet
This for my niggas out in Texas, watch 'em screw it
They say you a bop, but I been knew it
Like the soup, hot, yeah bitch you blew it
HS87 patch on my jacket
Hall of fame, oh yeah, I'm on a ballad (ballad)
Yeah, and I play on [?]
In my 95 Air Maxes
Now, you won't catch me lacking
I send you niggas packing point
Meet her where the cash is
Duck them questions that you asking
Zoomin pendant dancin'
Diamonds doing choreography
My chain look like it got a leak
You ain't goin', than you got to leave
Inside of the whip, same color as the autumn leaves
You gotta lot to say, get it off your chest
I get a lotta paid, not a lot of rest
Lied to her face when I said "I ain't like the rest", damn

[Refrain: Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy]
One hand on a whip
Just spend half a mil
Than I made it back
Made sure it's exact
Brought the party pack
Go 'head and crack the seal
Took that bitch to dealer
And she wasted half the mill
Damn, man, she thick
Damn, man, she thick
Damn, man, she thick
She gon have to get that Half-A-Mil tatted

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
I'm off this Earl Stevens
Am jumping in the deep end
I'm bout to cut my phone off
Don't call me when you need shit
Come see me if you need dick
I'm supposed to leave today
Cabo San Lucas, when my baby mama need a break
You got a lot to say, get it off your chest
Half-A-Mil parties, them be rated triple X
When you see my name, just know you fuckin' with the best
Short, thick and cute, that's a real nigga request
And I ran out of trust, my bitch is looking nuts
She ain't getting a ride home, shit, you can hit the bucket
You niggas trick too much, I just switch it up
She stuntin' on the internet, waiting on the DM
Y'all niggas play basketball, bitch I am a GM
Captain of the whole team, shooters in the whole thing
OPM, gold rings, I might suck her toes clean
Tequila with the crystal, faded like it's codeine

[Refrain: Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy]
One hand on a whip
Just spend half a mil
Than I made it back
Made sure it's exact
Brought the party pack
Go 'head and crack the seal
Took that bitch to dealer
And she wasted half the mill
Damn, man, she thick
Damn, man, she thick
Damn, man, she thick
She gon have to get that Half-A-Mil tatted

[Outro: Dom Kennedy]
She gon have to get that Half-A-Mil tatted...
