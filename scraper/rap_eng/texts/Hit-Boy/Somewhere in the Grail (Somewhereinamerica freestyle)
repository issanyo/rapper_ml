Dreamin of the late great j dilla. My nigga now whats realer uh
Maybe an iller villa, but im done wit my ex now she callin me beat killa
Seat thrillers secretly love the mic in hand
More purple hearts than a vikings fan
Just pressed start but might quit
Hit my x box now she dont like my band
Talkin bout hip hop if u ain't kno
Duckin her like rango
Nah my jeans can't hang low
But u kno that a nigga sang tho
Takin last shots spike lee
Worth too much to price me
And am I leavin aleysha
Ha bitch I might be!
Wink my left eye to farewell
Cuz my girl seein my fan mail
Heard bars now they want the d
I tell em to use they hand held
Now im singin more and rappin less
Quit smokin but I confess
I still pay aleysha visits
But my girl deleted her digits








So sick wit a notepad they callin me the goat mad
Freestylin be violent keep wildin n get your throat stabbed
The apparitions mortician listens will have u hittin ghost man
And stamp and stamp ya girl waitin for my package like a postman
She love my delivery ups my chivalry
Fallin for me like timber hot like embers in december
Str8 test niggas runtime never hit em wit a dumb line
Im like a blank paycheck they so shocked that im unsigned
Sick wit ur whore at hopkins for other reasons
2 more ho's wit her talkin merry tis the season
Believin these tails to my sonic but like a comet
Wishin on me never get a grant, scholars can't commit
But vomit off of the pack and jack dani in a fanni pack
Manni like degrassis back partyin wit my jimmy sack
Break a leg for this, goin since i was dead broke
When i was known for killin like bones in a black cloak


Hook:

Hip hop only love me when my gang perform
But she got more babies than lady rainicornn




Screw a fate these things been mistakes
Sin and hate mix like finn and jake
Misses speights hates how the end relates
And im showin niggas just how I can't bend the plates uh








Knew im great but beginners fake
Then I take what your winners make
When its late they pretend to wait
But im crossin new lines like im skippin states uh
Collect it by the quart death here is a sport
Im a kobe type of nigga winnin in both
Courts
Bein frank she wet as oceans  Thinkin off hype still
Created futures dnt produce but my nigga my mic will

Im out chillin with ur spouse like why?
She talkin but im quiet as a mouse then sigh
Goin out the house like bye
Yea I kno im fly I ain't lyin tellin hoes try
But this will leave a chick kirkin see
We ain't friends u just work with me
Im not normally endin dreams
But get burned 3rd

DegreeIm learnin see once they think they earned the d
Im dope they see locks but try to burn a key
In some scrubs pigeons try to perch with me
But if wifey see and youll be what she murkin b

(HOOK AGAIN)

Ain't ashamed to livin in hell
And my nigga fuck a jail
Better be here than stuck in a cell
I got enough bars in my holy graile
