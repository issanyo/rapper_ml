[Hook: B Mac The Queen (Hit-Boy)]
These niggas ain't got no stripes, not over here
These niggas ain't causin' no stress, not over here
These niggas ain't got no stripes, not over here
These niggas ain't causin' no stress, not over here
We the plug, we the plug, we the plug (Tell me what you need) [x4]

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Could it be my classic beats or my massive dreamin'
That make me different from yaâ€™ll?
I'm the new plug of the gang, finally sticking into the wall
It's the new regulator, I'm coming through the cut the breakers off
They yelling mayday while we taking off
I be at meetings and you ain't involved, naw you ain't at all
Going going gone, I'm hitting homers at the plate
Bitch I'm on fire, Mark McGwire back in 1-9-9-8
Tell me one time y'all hate, y'all in line I just skate
Ain't just eating, I own a buffet
I.E zone, know where I stay, I get it my way

[Hook]


[Verse 2: Oktane]
When a nigga need a hit, they comin' through and callin' Hit
Hit double back and get the click
Got niggas paying taxes, getting rich
Boy, life ain't never been a bitch
Only niggas that say that never hit
And if that's the case nigga that's a flip, HS87 niggas never switch
Cause I'm that dread headed, weed smoking, nigga all on your damn street
My clique out here popping, got shit jumping off in this damn thing
Cause playing it simple is crayons, nigga we can do this all day long
I still kick this like Fei Long, cause we are the plug you know what you need to stay on
B-Mac please believe it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Price]
I'm the plug if you need your fix
You can call us B-Mac, Kent, Rey, Haze, B The Hit
Roosevelt, [?] we the shit
He looks like [?], that young boy gon' die by the gun he lick
You takes pics of his cash on some bummy shit
Just how the steam is low, that's where your money is
Real talk,and I can help you
I used to stash dime bags by the belt loop
Now a nigga get cash and go hard with
Every single nigga in my clique that I starve with
Hold it down, who dat, we dat, word to we dat
Don't waste my time I got places to be at
Slow down and react, when you see dat
Nigga Price, I go hard for them stripes
Thought you knew

[Hook]
