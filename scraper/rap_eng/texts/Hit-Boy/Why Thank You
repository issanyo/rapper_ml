[Intro]
Yeah, that's perfect

[Chorus]
Feelin' better than I ever felt
Feelin' better than I ever felt
Why thank you
Feelin' better than I ever felt
Feelin' better than I ever felt
Meanwhile, these dead presidents keep coming, I'ma stack this
Wanna play for the big leagues, kid, practice
Live the lifestyle, wife a model or an actress
Oh, I'm so damn good at this
Muahahaha

[Verse 1]
Money straight like the way I drink bourbon
There's no one like me, stop searchin'
You can go and bet the house on it, mama, sure thing
You've been workin' for a while, somethin's not working
Wait for me to fail, then you got the wrong person
I am not an earthling, aliens birthed him
Crazy and disturbing
Belong in an insane asylum, Gerald's going crazy wildin'
But who cares? His paper's piling
I'll go vacation on my favorite island, take a valium
Kidnap Hit-Boy an' lock him up an' make an album
Could make a hundred new song,s fuck it, make a thousand
Never drop it, fuck the world, I'll be straight without them
Listen, cause low key, like two octaves down
Somewhere along the road became a monster now
Toured the world and I brought the town
We're eating plenty food over here, we got lots around

[Chorus]
I am feelin' better than I ever felt
Feelin' better than I ever felt
Why thank you
Feelin' better than I ever felt
Feelin' better than I ever felt
Meanwhile, these dead presidents keep coming, I'ma stack this (yeah)
Wanna play for the big leagues, kid, practice
Live the lifestyle, wife a model or an actress (you know)
Oh, I'm so damn good at this
Muahahaha (yeah)

[Verse 2]
At 15, I was on the struggle bus
25, on another bus with a couple sluts
Whole team's good now, there's nothing that could trouble us
Rolling up extendo blunts, light the double dutch
Nobody can fuck with us, you'd be quick to fail (fail)
The game's not for everybody, pick a different trail (trail)
They wanna talk business, well, I'm checking my avail ('vail)
Whole tour is sold out, there's not a ticket left for sale (nah)
We came a long way from fifty people at the shows (uh)
To crashing shit at fashion week, models getting chose (uh)
My table's full of (hahaha), you got a table full of bros
Damn, ain't know you was one of those (damn)
You might resemble clowns if you ever tried stepping in his shoe
So show respect is something you should definitely do
It's no surprise I'm on, got a bedroom with a view
I'm just saying this is everything we said that we would do

[Chorus]
I am feelin' better than I ever felt
Feelin' better than I ever felt
Why thank you
Feelin' better than I ever felt
Feelin' better than I ever felt
Meanwhile, these dead presidents keep coming, I'ma stack this
Wanna play for the big leagues, kid, practice
Live the lifestyle, wife a model or an actress
Oh, I'm so damn good at this
Muahahaha
