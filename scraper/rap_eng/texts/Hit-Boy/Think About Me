[Intro]
Uh woah
Hey hey ey ey
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Why do I, why do I feel this cold?
When I get to think about you this long
How do I lose, how do I lose this love for ya? (Yeah)
It's probably one the things that'll never change, that'll never change
Going insane, really messed up for ending this, this way
Big mistake, you got a new thang
Do you think you could find another like this babe?
Does he make you say?
Put your legs in the air, does he make 'em shake?
We get close then become one, you can't stay away
Reminiscing bout you now I can't help but think...

[Hook]
Do you, do you, girl
Do you ever think?
Do you, do you, you you, do you
Ever think about me
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Ever think, yeah
Do you, do you
Yeah, yeah

Do you think, think about me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?
Ever think about me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
Why do I, why do I feel this cold?
When I get to think about you this long
How do I choose, love or truth
Love or truth
I ain't satisfied, glad that I've realized you ain't no angel
Yeah I did some shit I'm ashamed of
I got to see what you're made of
These are the things I was afraid of
These type of feelings are dangerous
Take it day to day
Gotta get you out my mind, that's on everything
Gotta swallow all this pride, I'm on heavy drink
Let the Henny wash it down, I can't help but think...

[Hook]
Do you, do you, girl
Do you ever think, girl?
Do you, do you, you you, do you
Ever think about me
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Ever think, yeah
Do you, do you
Yeah, yeah

Do you think, think about me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?
Ever think about me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?
Do you think, do you think bout me?

[Outro] (x7)

Do you? Do you?
