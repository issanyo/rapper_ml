[Verse 1]
Can you
Imagine what it
Would be like if we never met
We never kissed
Can you
Imagine if we
Never got to spend those nights
In each other's arms?

[Pre-Chorus]
But I
Don't know how it feels
But it probably would kill me
Probably would tear me down
So I
I don't think about it
Cause my heart can't take it
If you were gone

[Chorus]
If you were gone (x8)

[Verse 2]
Can you
Picture yourself
Getting Getting older, dear
With someone else
I can't
Cause I feel like we
Are the exception to the rule
I know this love is true

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Break]
Don't rewind anything
Too excited to see what tomorrow brings yeah
You changed my world around
And I'm not scared to go falling down in love
What if you were gone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If you were
If you were
If you were gone
If you were (I can't imagine)
If you were (I can't imagine)
If you were gone
If you were gone
