[Intro: Machine Gun Kelly, 24hrs & Hit-Boy]
Twentyfour
Hold up
Hit-Boy

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & 24hrs]
Hop in, roll up
Bad bitch shotgun toes up
Gang signs, my block
All tattoos on my top (whew)
You can never ever stay the night
Rockstar that's my life
Never ever look at the price
Bitch don't try my life
Ay, ay, ay
Hop in, roll up
Bad bitch shotgun toes up
Gang signs, my block
All tattoos on my top (Kells!)
You can never ever stay the night (ay)
Rockstar that's my life (yeah)
Never ever look at the price
Bitch don't try my life

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly & 24hrs]
Hold up
I don't need, I don't need love
I just need three in the tub (three)
Give me good weed and some rub, yeah
Scrape up em' knees on the rug, yeah
Ain't gone show you no love, no
You say my name you a dub, no
Picked her up from the islands
She say "Twenty you wildin'"
Ayy, stayed up, can't sleep
Couple chickenheads it's a eight piece
Girls in the cars all topless
Rock God I was born in a moshpit, ungh

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & 24hrs]
Hop in, roll up
Bad bitch shotgun toes up
Gang signs, my block
All tattoos on my top
You can never ever stay the night
Rockstar that's my life
Never ever look at the price
Bitch don't try my life

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly & 24hrs]
Yeah, piped up and I can't stop it
Bang twenty bitches and pop it
Record label thinks I'm crazy
Showed up with the thing, no safety
You can't take me out the hood, don't fake me
Hundred twenty air fee have AC
Hundred square feet to a hundred K fee
If you ain't noticed I don't give much of a fuck lately (ay!)
Don't you ever try my life
VVS diamonds, my ice
Brand new Range Rov' black
She can't never come back

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & 24hrs]
Hop in, roll up
Bad bitch shotgun toes up
Gang signs, my block
All tattoos on my top
You can never ever stay the night
Rockstar that's my life
Never ever look at the price
Bitch don't try my life
Ay, ay, ay)
Hop in, roll up
Bad bitch shotgun toes up
Gang signs, my block
All tattoos on my top
Kells!
You can never ever stay the night (ay)
Rockstar that's my life (yeah)
Never ever look at the price
Bitch don't try my life

[Outro: Hit-Boy]
