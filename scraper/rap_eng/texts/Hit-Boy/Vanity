[Intro]
I'm not cocky
I just love myself, bitch!

[Verse 1]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the flyest bitch of them all?
Never mind, I am (that bitch is so fucking pretty)
Yeah, I am (if I were her, I would kiss me)
Mirror mirror on the wall
Hit up prince charming
Tell him give me a call
Never mind, screw him ('cause I found somebody better)
Never mind, screw him (I make myself so much wetter)

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday I see myself
I love me even more, it's me I adore
Ain't nobody got shit on me
I'm the best for sure, my cherie amore

[Chorus]
V is for vanity, everytime I look at me
I turn myself on, yeah, I turn myself on, yeah
V is for vanity, thank you mom and daddy 'cause
I turn myself on, yeah, I turn myself on, get into it

[Verse 2]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the sexiest of them all?
Nevermind, I am (I am, oh, she's so hot and sexy)
Yeah, I am (that's right, no, no wonder she's cocky)
Mirror, mirror on the wall
They call me stuck up, but I'm not at all
Nevermind I am, I am (it's not my fault I'm the shit)
Yeah, I am, and I'm a bad ass bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I see myself
I love me even more, it's me I adore
Ain't nobody got shit on me
I'm the best for sure, are you ready for me?

[Chorus]
V is for vanity, everytime I look at me
I turn myself on, yeah, I turn myself on, yeah
V is for vanity, thank you mom and daddy 'cause
I turn myself on, yeah, I turn myself on, get into it

[Verse 3]
No regrets, get into it
No apologies
Bam bam ba bam, bam bam ba bam
And now I take myself to be my lawfully wedded bitch
All the girls say, yeah, I'm vain, so what, so what
All the boys say, yeah, I'm vain, so what, so what
All the girls say, yeah, we're vain, so what, so what
Everybody say, yeah, we're vain, so what, and what? Woo!

[Chorus]
V is for vanity, everytime I look at me
I turn myself on, yeah, I turn myself on, yeah
V is for vanity, thank you mom and daddy 'cause
I turn myself on, yeah, I turn myself on, get into it

[Verse 4]
If the shoe fits, wear it bitch
If the shoe fits, wear it bitch
If the shoe fits, wear it bitch
Read my lips, muah, I'm a vain bitch, hey
Can't love no one else 'til love yourself
And if they don't like it, tell 'em get in line
And kiss your ass bitch (muah!)
Love you baby (au revoir)
That's right, let's go out like this

[Outro]
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of them all?
It's me, bow down, get on your knees
Where's my queens? Who reigns supreme?
Let me hear you scream, woo!
And the legacy lives on, going strong
Let us not forget
Who owns the throne?
You do mommy
