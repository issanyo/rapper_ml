[Hook]
Yeah, and you should know that automatically
Yeah, and you should know that automatically
Yeah, and you should know that automatically

[Verse 1]
I just read somewhere
Niggas who live for the future never get there
So I'm schemin' in the present, eatin' chicken skewers
Wristwear gleamin'
Been that nigga since the semen, still ain't what it seem
And I'm still shakin' my demons
From way back when I was dreamin' of takin' my region
Up early in the morning like Kathie and Regis
I wasn't into listenin' to the faculty teachin'
I'd rather go listen to Ye on my raggedy speakers
Heed to the facts that he's speakin'
Bless that child
Heard The College Dropout and now my test scores' down
It showed me I could advance without diplomas if I stay devoted
Send my beats to everybody and my prayers to Jehovah
My mama don't even know this, 9th grade, I was tuckin' a knife
For all the maybes, I had it in my Jansport for extra safety
When some niggas in Colton tried to play me
Had to stay on my 1s and 2s, Tom Brady
Bangin' Eminem shit then
Go and put on Suga Free to hear some pimp shit
Them summer days, hit the mall, spit at broads
No money for Chinese food, we'll come up with a strategy
And you should know that automatically

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I've been on my grind for so long
Listen to the story I tell in this song
I've been on my grind for so long
Listen to the story I tell in this song

[Verse 2]
Some people got wives and some people got groupies
Some people got lives and I just got this music
I can't nearly lie, we are livin' in the future
Iggy rode to my party in the back of a Buick
Now she boomin', I knew she was on the right path
Damn, the minute I seen that white ass
You know that [?] is a nice trail
So shout out to my nigga Mike L
I'm speakin' the real, I ain't just talkin'
You know how it feels when the shit is poppin'
Like you just went and got somethin' out the auction
Niggas treat you way different when your art chartin'
Turn from a friend to a fuckin' target
I'm rarely alone but I'm lonely often
Nigga either way it go, I'm in this bitch all in
And this the mothafuckin' plug, never no stallin'
This song is for the girls in the spot, fake hair, fake butt
Hire professionals just to do her club makeup
Turn up the decibels, let's hear it for respectable girls
Who hit up festivals, I think that I should let you know that...

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Okay now put these vibes into immediate use
If you cookin' in the kitchen, sweepin' or cleanin' your room
This ain't a meaningless tool, run it back 'bout 10 more times
While you're eating your food
Bang it at a restaurant where they serve seasonal fruit
Shit is goin' up like I released a balloon
I used to have a bad habit of speakin' too soon
And I was caught up on lookin' for that special spot
Made a couple bad calls but I don't ref a lot
Got no concept of a clock, I'm on hustler's time
Had to dump the beliefs that no longer apply
I smile and go to meetings, actin' like it's all fine
When I know I'm in the worst pub deal of all time
Dealin' through it with the prayers, RAW papers and strong wine
I know it'll be aiight but it's still a long ride
I'm more in tune with me than I used to be, truthfully
I've been on my shit so much I couldn't make the eulogy

[Outro]
R.I.P. my Grandpa Deno, my nigga Earl Hayes
