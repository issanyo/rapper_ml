[Verse]
Never cautious, I'm bringing swords, to tar
With sword fish, the lord of all rawness
Nigga, pause, or try to stop this, I'm off but lit
Ya'll still depending of help, I'm care free
Like ya mom's tits in the shower bitch
You needing for life's fuck up, like a ostrich in a mosh pit
Fuck being cold, I'm polar, disease ridden
And nauseous, ill in the mind, sickened
Known for my rhyming to be toxic I don't drop bars
I drop the dumbbell on your conscious
The most niggerish nigga niggling through instrumentals
Harder than the hair off Nigerians, praise Weezy
I'm never going easy, unless the E equals twice the MC
Of him or me, then bitch, let's see, and never meet peace
If you my nigga you ain't still getting cut slack
A$AP did this with 6 of favorite rappers, I'm one pack of it
Hectic through sections, if you a middle man
My third finger ready for lifting, lyrics will spin off
The grinder, like I'm selling in the drug position and division
Now, get the stepping, my M-16 pump more than pistons
Let me make a list then, of all the times
Niggas would try to diss me, for running my mouth
Fuck the kissing, that's for bitches
Bitch, I don't got no damn off switch
And I swear to God I'm snapping more
Than rat traps, in a house of swiss, bitch
And my dick look anorexic, but when a bitch
Go southern for where my text is, saying "get this stick"
Like Pinocchio had an erection, she went straight in
Like after the nigga came out wearing a cheetah dress
And they face smothered with pink lipstick, ain't that some shit
I'll put every fucking wack rapper in a casket
I'll spit till my lungs hurt, and smoke 10 cigs while laughing
I didn't have to cut crack to do what I do
I wrote and studied my craft, half these rappers
On question 2, and as much as an asshole I am
No pack of whooping's will be in a can, I'll knock you
Till you fly through a loop like you was Toucan Sam
And I don't like none of ya'll like green ham
Uppercut, and kick rocks, Liu Kang, man in all black
Ready, for the return, Bruce Wayne
I'm the great, so stand, like our anthem was playing, damn
