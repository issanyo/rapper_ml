[Hook: MAK]
Majesty
Majesty
Majesty
And its me

[Verse: Nikova]
I wanna thank yall for listening a few rappers missing
Guess they couldn't get the point that hollow in the joint
And what its doing moving a crowd of my choosing
Bruising or losing your teeth like the beat
I leave no room to eat my tables like a fast
The opposite though cause the food covers glass
The place mats blast abetter bass for that ass
Sit on down I bet producers want me last
So I'mma last like a reign, I arm a cast of these flames
Show'em straight up what I mean how I feel and it how it seem
If you put together things you can see it like a dream
When I'm walkin' on the moon know I'm higher than your ruin
Who pursuin'? Leave'em lost bet they chargin' like a boss
And the cost was a lyric Stephen shouldn't've done at all
I be like nigga please, ain't no beggin' or no knees
Ain't no standing down on trees I'm sittin already breeze
I'm sittin on ready leaves, the better sin to be
I meditate him to beast, don't worry its just a feast
I'mma show you what's unleashed, a medic monk with a key
Feelin' like a doctor detoxin my dope free
When its me contraband no drummers or 2D sand
On a land where I want I'mma land where I want
Take the 808s stunt like a funk, its skunk
Like a skunk is funk I gotta say its been fun
Its been real I gotta go taking with me so much soul
Let explode I guess that's C4 to your door
I say know no more your brain should be sore
Hard thinking lines that's thoughtful sometimes
And ah well if it rhymes, I better get some shine
To be so sarcastic you oughta' know mine

[Hook]
