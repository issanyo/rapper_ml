[Verse 1]
I looked in your eyes
And for the very first time
I watched the sunrise in
Some colors I've never seen before
It's like the sky was
A brighter shade of blue
I feel like I've been sleeping all this time
And now I'm awake

[Pre-Chorus]
All the things that I've been missing
Doesn't matter now I'm living
Almost lost my faith in love
But since you came, in love I trust

[Chorus]
I can love again
I can breathe again
I can feel again
And it's cause of you I can
I can love again
I can breathe again
I can feel again
And it's cause of you I can
I can love again
I can breathe again
I can feel again
And it's cause of you I can  (oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Cause of you I can

I can breathe again
I can breathe again

[Verse 2]
All my life I've wanted to be loved and
Kept in accepted with you there is no judgement
Sure love [?] to kiss me
Is that good enough to last forever
Maybe I've been sleeping all this time
And now I'm awake

[Pre-Chorus]
All the things that I've been missing
Doesn't matter now I'm living
Almost lost my faith in love
But since you came, in love I trust

[Chorus]
I can love again
I can breathe again
I can feel again
And it's cause of you I can
I can love again
I can breathe again
I can feel again
And it's cause of you I can
I can love again
I can breathe again
I can feel again
And it's cause of you I can (oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Cause of you I can

I can love again
I can breathe again
I can feel again
And it's cause of you I can
I can love again
I can breathe again
I can feel again
And it's cause of you I can
I can love again
I can breathe again
I can feel again
And it's cause of you I can (oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Cause of you I can

[Outro]
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
(I can breathe)
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
(I can breathe)
I can breathe... again
I can breathe... again, again
