[Verse 1: ChrisX$treets]
Maniplating minds like a television
Roll another spliff up, and hit the jay hard until i hiccup
My brain is corrupt, learned the system just to fuck it up
I took your classes just to fight the powers
Now that im about to graduate i swear the world is ours
I'll probably get assinated at my graduation, for knowing too much about the rules of education
And tryna cnange the system through my years of observations
If im illuminated, then my fans illuminati
And you might need a dictionary because your misconstrued prolly
Brainwashed your son, now im fucking on your daughter
The new world order is probably out of order
Burn american flags with black lighters
Y'all just flip-flop like runnin' from cops in chanclitas
Look at where im from, nigga, i deserve an applause
Cause im breaking over barriers instead of breaking laws
My grandmother broke from years of stuffin' collection plates
Trying to get my 40 acres not dealing with section 8
They gave us a rug, just to snatch it from under us
The feds gave us drugs, now I'm cooking up angel dust
My mindstate is further, just unleasing all my burdens
Need to free my mind, and doing so, i made murder
I need to introduce you to the the illest nigga doing it
The illest two doing it, the illest crew doing it
But we dont get the recognition that we all deserve
Only way you seeing $treets is with your face on the curb
Nigga im obserd, bending words, fucking birds
Everytime i spit a verse, please analyze the words
The wordplay is wicked, my niggas call me gifted
My peers think I'mma weirdo but i just say im different
And i dont mean to brag but i kinda like to brag
Feel the wrapth of the titans when me and my niggas clash
