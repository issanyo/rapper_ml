[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Usually I hit it one time then I zoom, yeah
Used to bust 'em down and cop 'em by the zoos, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Real shit, they should arrest you, your mama blessed you
Class of 2017, SDSU, that's where she graduated
Congratulations, let me check the calculations
Yeah it's time to ball out on Robertson, I get you Gucci frames
Bring through all your friends, none of my niggas lame
Let me put you on some game, baby fuck me out the gate
That might get you a better chance to stay around
Fuck it up 'til that hundred rounds
Nigga think they in but they out of bounds, yeah
Too much gossip in they mouth
Even if we down, fuck I still bet the whole house

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Usually I hit it one time then I zoom, yeah
Used to bust 'em down and cop 'em by the zoos, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom

[Verse 2: Yung Pinch]
Hop in the whip and then I zoom away
Shawty wanna know what we gon' do today
I told her don't you worry 'bout me no more
Don't you worry 'bout me no more
Had a good thing going, threw it all away
Gotta get it on my own, I'ma call the plays, yeah
Don't you worry 'bout me no more
Don't you worry 'bout me no more
I'ma get it on my own bitch, follow my lead
We gon' link up at the top and it's bottles on me
Yeah don't you worry 'bout me no more
Don't you worry 'bout me no more

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Usually I hit it one time then I zoom, yeah
Used to bust 'em down and cop 'em by the zoos, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom
Usually I hit it one time then I zoom, yeah
Used to bust 'em down and cop 'em by the zoos, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom

[Verse 3: 03 Greedo]
Told her pull up on me in the Jordan Downs
Would you love me even when I'm not around?
DEA said I caught with four pounds
When you the plug, how the fuck does that sound?
Allegations go around
Niggas hatin' every time I'm out of town
Clothing line, shoppin' down
I'm in the field, you out of bounds
Can't give the bitch a lil gown
Not a ring, not now
Plus I'm goin' down
And I can't even raw, free me

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Usually I hit it one time then I zoom, yeah
Used to bust 'em down and cop 'em by the zoos, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom
Usually I hit it one time then I zoom, yeah
Used to bust 'em down and cop 'em by the zoos, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom, yeah
You can't catch me in that thing when it go vroom

[Outro: Yung Pinch]
Hop in the whip and then I zoom away
Shawty wanna know what we gon' do today
I told her don't you worry 'bout me no more
Don't you worry 'bout me no more
