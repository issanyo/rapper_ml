(Intro:Blacksoul)
Blacksoul is a rapper
But more than a rapper
He's an artist,who makes music
For the masses(you know)
(Verse:blacksoul)
This ain't rhyming
This is just expressing my thoughts
For so long,anger was abusing my thoughts
To pick a pen,felt like the only resort
So now you know,everything im rapping is real
By the name blacksoul,im perfectly suited
Because my soul is the only thing that cannot be diluted
I had to run around the streets for me to find peace
Coz not knowing my grand dad took away my mental peace
Sometimes i just wonder
Did he look like me?
Would he be happy if i graduated with a degree?
But above that is a feeling only music can give me
So university is just another formality
I was told never to plan my life around things that change
Those were wise words
But now they sounding strange
Coz im sitting with a pen and im trying to write music
Im ill
There ain't no reason for you to confuse it
Looking at my nephew
The younger version of me
He likes wearing snapbacks and dances to Jay-Z
Back then i looked stupid
Coz they didn't understand
But now i rock nike dunks and they say im the man
When i was sixteen
All of my dreams was miles away
But now im chatting to my idol
It was just the other day
So all the nonsense niggas talk about signing a deal
I dont buy it
And i dont give a shit how you feel
Struggling is a feeling we can never get used to
So getting out of the hood is the primary issue
Once you start to succeed
Niggas say that u've changed
They talk as if they was expecting you to be the same
So my hometown streets
Are not the same no more
Niggas i thought had my back is behaving like hoes
Not giving a shit
Thats the life i live
To be honest
You niggas ain't real as this

(Outro: Blacksoul)
Yeah it ain't a lot for you to think of
But thats just the shit that i came up with,you know
Everyday,struggling trying to make a living(you know)
Blacksoul is the name
Thats what im trying to push right now
Shout out to all the niggas in hood
Trying to sruggle
Trying to make music and everything like that
I hope the music touches your lives and everything like that
Coz thats what i do,trying to touch lives
Ay
Ay
Dont be look like that
Ay
Dont you look like that
