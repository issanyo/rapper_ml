[Hook: Hit-Boy]
I can't even see us in the frame no more, I must be out the picture
Hopin' that you find what you looking for
With you and your new nigga
(no I don't - fuck that)
I couldn't picture that
Me out the picture, couldn't picture that
I was 'bout to pop the question, couldn't picture that
Me out the picture couldn't picture that

[Bridge 1: K. Roosevelt]
Damn baby, remember you would say I was the man, baby
We would be together hand and hand baby
Then you had to go switch up the plan baby
Don't understand baby (Goddamn)

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Maybe I do
Okay I do
Nightmares of you saying I do
Putting up snapshots all on instagram of your weddin'
True to life that be deadly
S.O.S. somebody help me
Save the world it's bigger than yourself - stay takin' them selfies
Natural desire turned to natural disaster
Please rephrase the question if love is the answer
You was everything I had been hopin'
Now I can't really see it
Came in and out of focus

[Hook: Hit-Boy]

[Bridge 2: Hit-Boy] x2
You wanna know who I love?
First word of this bar baby, that's you

[Bridge 3: K. Roosevelt]
Don't ever sing about now to some new nigga
You say you hold it down for him
But you already know it ain't the same (oh)
We both know it ain't the same, nah
I can't even see us in the frame no more, I must be out the picture
I doubt that you find what you looking for
With you and your new nigga
(no I don't - fuck that)

[Verse 2: Chili Chil]
Baby, girl
You done left a piece of your life inside these clothes, fightin' the truth
I know, I know you heard me on the radio
Na, na, all over your body
Give me that shit, bang
(nigga fuck your clique)
Put your hands up in the sky, ho
Ra-a-ailin' your bitch these niggas all flow
You know she pop it like she from the projects
Just keep your heart bro
We can't be all broke
Before we're all toast
Because hostess past the himalayas where it's safer, Lord save us
(Mercy)
