[Intro: Yung Pinch]
Hit-Boy
Lately I've been tweaking, been thinking something don’t feel right
Yeah, oh

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Lately I've been tweaking, been thinking something don't feel right, yeah, yeah
This is real life, this is real life
She said she ain’t never seen no demons in the real life
They all around me, I can't live no more
'Cross the country, got it lit on tour
Diamonds dancing like they hit the floor
They keep asking what it hit me for
Ooh baby, when you talk like that
Ooh baby, when you talk like that, yeah
Ooh baby, when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Ooh bring that thing back

[Verse 1: Yung Pinch]
Shawty wanna talk but she so childish
Dress myself, put some money on stylist
Shawty telling all the lies, I won't buy it
Yeah, I hope you been adding up you mileage
I'm speeding
I heard you needed me
But I'm leaving
I'm leaving secretly
You better listen what I'm saying when I tell you these things
And you best not treat me different when I’m rocking these chains
I know you finna jump (yeah)
You could take it how you want
I know there’s so much more
For you than me right now
Yeah

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Lately I've been tweaking and thinking something don’t feel right
Lately I've been tweaking and thinking something don't feel right
She ain't never seen a demon sent in real life
They all around me, I can’t live no more
Cross the country, got it lit on tour
Diamonds dancing like they hit the floor
They keep asking what it hit me for
Oh baby, when you talk like that
Oh baby, when you talk like that (yeah)
Oh baby, when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Oo bring that thing back

[Verse 2: Phora]
I've been feeling low now
I've been taking too much shit I'm tryna slow down
Ever since you left me I been on my own (ah)
I been really trying not to lose control now
Ayy, yeah, all these demons in my head tryna shoot them down
All these niggas fake as fuck when they come around
I'm just tryna hold you, not tryna let you down
I'm just tryna make you smile, wanna make you proud
Oh baby when you walk like that
I ain't never seen you talk like that
You should know I need you here right now
You confront me and you brought it right back
Yeah
Demons in my head, yeah, a nigga never sleep
Tell her love and care, babygirl I'm tryna keep
I been with you seven days, now a nigga weak aye
You got what you want
I got what you need

[Chorus: Yung Pinch & Phora]
Lately I've been tweaking and thinking something don't feel right
So I don't feel right
Lately I've been tweaking and thinking something don't feel right
She ain't never seen a demon sent in real life
They all around me, I can't live no more
Cross the country, got it lit on tour
Diamonds dancing like they hit the floor
They keep asking what it hit me for
Oh baby, when you talk like that
Oh baby, when you talk like that (yeah)
Oh baby, when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Oo bring that thing back

[Outro: Yung Pinch]
When you walk like that
When you wanna spend this cash
We be living fast
