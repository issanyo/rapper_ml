[Verse 1 : Hit-Boy]
Where the, where the, where the
Where the white girls with the black girl asses?
Go on shake it fast and let me know you nasty
Her name Tracy, I gave her dick
I’m ballin out, I can spray my wrist
Start to work for Lays I'm makin' chips
I don’t fuck with banks, I was made for this

[Hook]
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Man we gon get this, man man we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Man we gon get this, man man we gon get this dough

[Verse 2 : Price]
One time
Look I pray I make it to heaven
Cause Lord knows I ain’t no reverend (I’m not)
I was absent in that classroom but on the block I was present
I had to get it, get it, get it cause I never had it
No limit in the airforce, box rock stashin'
Then go back it, I been grabbing cash and niggas can’t imagine
Too much passion and I’m getting tired, sleepin' on this mattress
Sayin' white girl, come through
Take off your clothes, strike a pose
Wait! I think my mama comin
Pull up your panties, wipe your nose
Glockin' on that corner, probably make about 10 [?]
Yeah  them yard boys don’t need banks
I’m doin well without the fargo
With this

[Hook]
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Man we gon get this, man man we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Man we gon get this, man man we gon get this dough

[Verse 3 : Kent Money]
No account for the mafia
Talkin' real cash, nothing for the obvious
We a keep at, shoot your whole lobby up
Keep it toe taggin' put yo mama copy up
My call of duty, that paper man
Fuck semi, I can count mine
My lease is made up
Might murk you back to jump up like everything’s fine
My mama car sent by museum
And such a pray for me, real brief
And I did the same when she changed her mind
All I did was slide through in peace
Guess it all depends on how you see us
Round these tents it ain’t no secret
But that box of size 12’s come in handy
Nigga I leave it with the

[Hook]
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Man we gon get this, man man we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Man we gon get this, man man we gon get this dough

[Verse 4 : Oktane]
Uhh, alright
(Where the white girls with the black girl asses)
That’s the only question me and Hit-Boy been askin
These white girls got white bodies
And I love that and I hit a action
I got that Bam Bam for your Pebbles girl
I’m in your body, where I can stash it
You know I ain’t gon make you my misses
Can’t even be my mistress
You just my toy I pick up when my favorite one is missin
I make 'em French Montana pop that
Your cellphone? Drop that
No Instagram, start strippin' mam
And when the money come out don’t be alarmed
Know I got that

[Hook]
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Man we gon get this, man man we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Shoebox money and the lean, we gon get this dough
Man we gon get this, man man we gon get this dough

[Outro : Hit-Boy]
Ride ride ride
Catch up niggas, we ain’t playin' no games
We ain’t playin' with you motherfuckin' lames
Nah nigga, we ain’t the same, ain’t the same
I said catch up niggas, we ain’t playin no games
We ain’t playin' with you motherfuckin lames
Nah nigga, we ain’t the same, ain’t the same
Cause when you wanna shed tears for you niggas
We put fear in you niggas
Fuck around, I sit being back here for you niggas
I make it clear for you niggas
Niggas niggas niggas
