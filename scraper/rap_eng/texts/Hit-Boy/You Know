[Verse 1]
Baby, something isn't feeling right
I don't even know the reason why
You tell me you love me one day
Next day, you don't know where it's going to go
I've heard it all before, oh, I've heard it all before

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I love you, I hold you down everyday
So, don't hurt me no more, my love's got a limit
You know, you know I love you, I hold you down everyday
So don't hurt me no more, my love's got a limit

[Chorus]
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know
You know, you know, you know

[Verse 2]
Lately I been thinking, you and I
We would make it if we try
I want you to tell me you don't wanna see me go
And you want us to grow
Before I hit the door, before I hit the door

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I love you, I hold you down everyday
So, don't hurt me no more, my love's got a limit
You know, you know I love you, I hold you down everyday
So don't hurt me no more, my love's got a limit

[Chorus]
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know
You know, you know, you know

[Bridge]
My-my-my lo-love has a limit
My-my-my lo-love has a limit
My-my-my lo-love has a limit
My-my-my lo-love has a limit
My-my-my lo-love has a limit
My-my-my lo-love has a limit
My-my-my lo-love has a limit
My-my-my lo-love has a limit

[Chorus]
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know

[Outro]
You know, you know, you know
Don't hurt me no more
