[Intro]
Dark days,[?]

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Coppin' new chains
That's payback for my dark days
Light another one
Roll another one
Any wild park[?] should I spark shit
The hardships almost made me heartless
Off the leash broke off the harness
Out of the homies I think I took it the farthest
I promised myself a long time ago
To think big and look through the wider scope
Don't let'em get you twisted like kaleidoscope
Kickin' real shit, hope I reach the goal posts
Dom K from the [?] that's my bro-bro
Tequila backstage at the Novo
Hater types, yeah we all know those
Can't fuck wit cha energy, it be so-so

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
Yeah (yeah)
Again
Free time flows
Well we blast
Look out the window
It's amazin' (it's amazin')
It's amazin' (it's amazin')
It's amazin' (it's amazin')
I went from spraying Tommy to that Tom Ford
Speed, yellow push, I got that on order
Hey, it's amazin' (it's amazin')
And it's amazin' (it's amazin')

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Never the one to preach
I just talk true shit
Somehow, some way
Put it together like glue sticks
My pop's forty-six, still woopin'
Ace on this free big here, stupid
Fell out wit a lot of these boys
Start callin' the head boy Fall Out Boy
Landin' in the right situation through a wrong choice
Protect the driveway, n*gga, all toys
Used to stand at Toys-R-Us and play mad
If I lost at all would never lose passion
Look at my jersey n*gga, it say captain
Y'all was actin' before the director said action

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy]
Yeah (yeah)
Again
Free time flows
Well we blast
Look out the window
It's amazin' (it's amazin')
It's amazin' (it's amazin')
It's amazin' (it's amazin')
I went from spraying Tommy to that Tom Ford
Speed, yellow push, I got that on order
Damn, it's amazin' (it's amazin')
And it's amazin' (it's amazin')

[Outro: Hit-Boy]
Coppin' new chains
Coppin' new chains
Coppin' new chains
