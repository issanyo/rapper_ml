One Minute I’m TOO much for these niggas then I’m THREE much for these hoes!
But FOR YOU I’m just A Rookie with some FIVE Star Flows!
But you niggas still thinking it’s A Mother Fucking GAME???

[First Verse]
Gunna Murder everything you believe in til I'm like Your New Religion!
Vision of My Own Promise Land with less Friends and more Decisions!
Big Spot with Small Room in it! Small Fry with Big Sharks Swimming
No time for Bitch Ass Niggas and Less time for all these Women!
You thinking that you winning? Yeh you First with no one behind ya!
When you spit it is A SIN! When I spit it is A Scripture
Of Greatness unveiling! No stopping! This Power
So give me My Throne or I’ll take it from ya singing
Guess who’s in The Building! KA-ME is My Fucking Name!
Not doing this for The Money but I can use A Little Fame!
But you niggas still thinking it’s A Mother Fucking GAME???
Well this I’m just saying
All you niggers is jokers! All you niggers is posers
All you niggers so fake your whole life falls through ya
So all you niggas CAN think it’s A Mother Fucking Game!

[Second Verse]
Coming straight from Trinidad but FUCK Nicki Minaj!
Nawww you have it wrong I wah Fuck Nicki Minaj!
Give her A Real Taste of A Dungeon Dragon!
Hip-Hop’s BEST Secret but now this Tongue is Bragging
And Your Brain is lagging! Try Your Best to KEEP UP!
Squeeze Tomatoes on Your Shoes so that Your Feet could Ketchup
You thought that I would give in? you thought that I would let up?
Well even The Racist thought that Obama had no Fucking LUCK!
Nowww he in The White House! Annnd I’m far from

[Final Verse]
I'mma shake you so now you Haitian!
Drown you! You so New Orleans!

Fuck the prejudice! Lets walk around like equals
One Caribbean! One Love!
Fuck Politics they don’t care bout US!
One Caribbean! One Love!
Bob Marley told me let unity be their drug
So I’m moses on my verses
Separating The Good from The Worthless
Bring A New Land of Hope
Into The Minds of The Hopeless
I feel like that is My Purpose!
So I'mma keeping that as My Focus!
Turn My Dreams to A Reality
Still look like Hocus Pocus
YET… Every nigga wanna try TEST ME…
But I pass them CEE EX CEE…
But I pass them Like ESSS AYYY TEES
Like Drake passed Chris at The Grammies
But I don’t want awards!
I’m not looking for Prizes!

For you that walk in Disguises!
YUP! You Heard RIGHT!

Shit was so nice I had to say that shit twice!
Selling whole sale lies! I not even HALF PRICE
But they’re Famous! I’m not… That not even HALF RIGHT
