[Intro]
Hold up
Wait a minute
Let me put some Inland in it
Hold up
Wait a minute
Let me put some Inland in it

[Verse 1: Price Tag]
We don't know y'all niggas so it's fuck y'all
And you bitches be too messy, we don't trust y'all
When this shit drops, tell them broke boys move back
I never hated on a nigga, how it feel to do that?
Now follow me as we go to this place called the toe
Where the skinny niggas ride and the real niggas roll
It was me, G40, Pete, too, ran those
Said they tryna throw a function and they know it's finna go
I say cool, they say yep, tell the hoes is going up
We need condoms, cups, music and sluts
Get some Hen', honey jack, and lemon for the shots
And get some clear cause you know bitches love that Ciroc
Now make that ass clap and lift your thighs up
I'm making money while your nigga making lies up
32 on my waist, that's my jeans size, keep a 32 on my waist for the mean times
She can feel the wood while she dancing,(Ooooo! You Nasty!)
I took her to the room so we could do the nasty
Oo-chie Walley, I'm up in that coochie probably going crazy
Come get a bar at 380, bitch

[Bridge]
She wanna give it all to me
Cause she faded off the grass and the goose
So she calling on a real nigga
Cause he don't dick her down like I do
And I'mma bang for the set
So she know I'm going hard
And if you ain't acting like the man in charge
Then hop up in your car, got the telly in front

[Hook]
Tell that bitch to get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
Yeah, tell that bitch to get a bar
Ho, come and get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
Ho, come and get a bar
Yeah, I tell that bitch to get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
Ho, come and get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
Ho, come and get a bar

[Verse 2: Oktane]
I'm drunk as fuck, I'm lifted
Hit-boy, make the beat haze mixed it
Price just got the zags and he twisting
HS87 is my clique, I never switch, bitch
You know this shit thump and you clap at all times
With the pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
So our times broke the truth and said that whether blue or red
The IE treat me like the new Snoop with dreads
So follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me cause I just can't quit
And the west been waiting on some gangsta shit
Price came, got me, so I go get papi
Turtle, N.no, Esso, B-Nice and let's see you stop me
Nigga, we out here, really out here
I don't care what you 'bout here, if you out here
Understand, I don't know how to act, I ain't no motherfucking actor
I'm from 909 and it's the same way backwards, nigga

[Bridge]
She wanna give it all to me
Cause she faded off the grass and the goose
So she calling on a real nigga
Cause he don't dick her down like I do
And I'mma bang for the set
So she know I'm going hard
And if you ain't acting like the man in charge
Then hop up in your car, got the telly in front

[Hook]
Tell that bitch to get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
Yeah, tell that bitch to get a bar
Ho, come and get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
Ho, come and get a bar
Yeah, I tell that bitch to get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
Ho, come and get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
I tell that bitch to get a bar
Ho, come and get a bar

[Outro]
Y'all niggas act like you're too cool to dance
Y'all niggas need to ease up on that round before y'all split your pants
And leave that to my niggas, young, fly niggas
Getting down, do what that niggas don't try, niggas
