Yessir, North Sessions Bitch. uh
Bish it's for the team!
Bish it's for the team!
Mb had a dream!

Uh

[Freestyle: M_Bizzerg]
Living on a day to day, that's what?
Basis, hate this I'll still touch
Any motherfuckin beat-
Rap on that, put a stack on that I'll tear shit up
Back to the basics, and then what?
Greatness, ape shit like our cuz
Go gorillas! Yo flow familiar
My flow Ben Stiller like Zoolander
Two hands bra their behind the back
While I'm blind folded with a pint of jack
Mind focused like L Dicap- Inception, fresh in all black!
Grim reap flow and your time is at, approximately..
Right now, stopping me? Just how, your plot to cease my crown ain't going down

[Beat break]
I'm rolling round the city with the windows down and the crew turned up in the backseat
Kickin freestyles that are worth your while, while I change my styles to half beats
Literally kill the beat doing Diddley, tend to be in vicinities with a bottle of Hennessy
Felony? Na! Never have, never will, never will a cop ever cop a feel

[Beat break]
Ask Copperfield!
I poof like magic, move like static proof I'm the baddest!
In the booth i no doubt wreak havoc, MBmatic, so fantastic
Flow down pat bitch call it Patrick
Your like Monix, I'm like Maravich
A washing machine can't clean this flow
I flow like dirties and lean. Whoa!
Hot like grills on high heat
Ima catch like Mitt, no Romney
It's a stretch for you to outrhyme me
So better stretch out that mind, see
Fetch for my dogs in times of need
When the times are hard I'm goin' hard
ROlling up! Pouring cups! Flowing something like the ocean spuds. The White Kud(kid)-
On top of shit in the Spur of the moment no Popovich
That popular, unstoppable, phenomenal, so audible
So audible, cuz ya just can't play with boy going hard straight from Phillay!
Ok Ok Ok Ok
