[Intro: Robin Thicke]
Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed
Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
I was over played like Mike Jackson hits
I swear them Growing Pains was Alan Thicke
Now we’re crying less and we’re smiling
High off life and we wilding
I just pray that I don’t OD before the league, Len Bias
Sending thank you's to my old teachers
Who told me I was dreaming
Cause now I’m in the Aston Martin Luther King, speeding
And the bad bitch, my cargo
I’m so fueled, that’s our code
By the niggas who trying to stop Argo
Now we’re American Idols like a FOX show
I remember waiting all in line, in line
Now the legends ask me can I make time, make time
So you should look up, be proud of this nigga
Pop your face, just smile for a nigga
For the people that used to front
Middle fingers up, fuck you very much

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed
Oh, it’s all I ever dreamed of
It’s all I ever dreamed
It’s all I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, it’s all I ever dreamed

[Verse 2: Price Tag]
I remember having a dream with the world in my palm
Now I just copped a new crib, gave the keys to my mom
Since I signed with John Janick, yeah, I think I’m Lebron
Think I’m Bin Laden, that mean I think I’m the bomb
'We'd never make it here', that’s what they told us
Now we’re burning cause we earn it, so what?
Club full of white girls with no butt
They wanna smoke, I told her "Marilyn Monroe/roll up"
For a nigga who ain’t never had nothing
Who came up from the bottom and made it to the top
To a nigga getting ends
No rims on a Benz, rich nigga could you stop?
Now we getting cake, Anna Mae
We getting cake, Anna Mae
Them cold nights we used to pray
Now it’s cold ice, open up the Ace

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Oktane]
I heard a gang of niggas got fired, Wayne about to retire
And on everybody’s top five, Oktane getting higher
I do it one time for my haters, and ya'll know who you are
These niggas hating my guts
Cause I got mine customized in my car, let’s go
Now Hit-Boy said it best, "We're just all young and excited"
With the cripple women you would kill for just dying to be invited
Then they want us, we don’t need them
You never did this, don’t believe them
Put your cellphone on that table
And keep your hands where I can see them, girl
They lying if they say this party ain’t everything that it seems
Making music that we love, laying on top of the girl of your dreams
I just hit her door, I knock-knock
Make her hit the floor, then stop, drop
Now your favorite model, I got screaming

[Hook]

[Bridge: K. Roosevelt]
We get it, get it, get it, get it, my nigga
Cause we live it, live it, live it, live it, live it
We’re gonna get it, get it, get it, get it, my nigga
Cause we live it, live it, live it, live it, live it
It’s all I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
All I ever, all I ever dreamed
