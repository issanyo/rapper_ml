[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
Go, go, go
Dommy
3-2-3

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Ain't nobody out here that can stop me
From rap to fashion
My books is [?]
My whips, they rack-tops
Avoiding the county jail
She like, how the weed smell
I tell her, just sit back
And listen to what I wrote
I think I'ma need both
Crib in palace [?], lost feelings
What's your credit score, you need a loan, huh?
Love the way I'm gettin' on my own, huh?
I been makin' plays for the long run
Make her read the book, til' she overstand it
Then rub her ass, cause I'm so romantic
Don't play games with me, I'm the wrong one
Our first date was at the [?]
They let it be like Dominic's an asshole
Just cause I'm all about my cash flow
She smackin' on my shit, like it's gummy worms
See me with her friend, made her stomach turn
New Porsche in both colors
New Rollies in both colors
Old-schools, like 4 of them
Bank accounts, like 4 numbers

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy & Hit-Boy]
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Don't doubt it

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy]
Yeah, Half-A-Mil party, make the news clips
Buss it open, while we play the new shit
I'ma split the swisher, while you do the splits
Hammer Dance on her, one too legit
Our first date was at the bowling alley
Pants in the valley, so you know I had to knock it down
I'm good for puttin' hoes in the lost and found
But she hate it when I'm not around, yeah
All my niggas, that Dior with the 4-2-4
Office car with my lawyer, runnin' up the score, like
Where we [?] the deal, I think I'm finna [?] meals
Pull off in the DeVille
Spend that OPM
Swervin' on the freeway, rant like go, go, go
While my girl talking on my telephone pole
Taking flicks of my inner [?] pose
Excessive celebrations, dunkin' on the go post

[Chorus: Dom Kennedy & Hit-Boy]
Go, go, go (yeah)
Go, go, go (Hit-Boy make your bitch)
Go, go, go
Don't doubt it

[Outro: Dom Kennedy]
Ay, still catchin' plays, not catchin' feelings
Watch me do my thang
Ay, still catchin' plays, not catchin' feelings
She see me do my thang
When it's Super Bowl, that's another million
Champagne sprayin' all over the ceiling
When it's Super Bowl, that's another million
Champagne sprayin' all over the ceiling
Don't doubt it...
