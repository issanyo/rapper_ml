[Hook: Price]
I been out getting paid
I come home and the city going crazy
Hit the block and everybody wave
Showing love shit feel like a parade (2x)


[Verse 1: Oktane]
God damn nigga it's a good day to be the realest
You're not a real nigga then you probably won't feel it
Hit the block got that thang cooking hotter than a skillet
I'm loco, you're just local
My nigga it's a difference
Keep it real my nigga half you niggas don;t do shit
Only thing hotter than this is the new shit
And I ain't never stopping for you, nigga you quit
Stand back give me some room watch me do this shit
I told you if it's poppin'
Get the shot and Ima take it
And shit will really really get poppin' if you're patient
And you stop being patient
And you're working while you're waiting
And you get a GP like you ride with Gary Payton
Niggas took the best group
Put them with Hit-Boy
Now you got them young niggas feeling like rich boys
Hit the block on the new tip, thousand dollar wheels
Ima show you how it feel
Touch a woman on the rear

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Price]
One time, look
Now I can guarantee your favorite top rapper ain't topping this
The whole fucking city gon' be knocking this
I'm riding down the block with my eyes low
But I can guarantee my pockets on the opposite
Now where my hustlers trying to sell something
I'm one of them niggas you can't tell nothing
I'm from the state of that motherfucking shell busting
But every state these niggas love me like Michelle husband
Cause a nigga talk that shit, walk that shit
If money was my girl, I'd stalk that bitch
Benzo hit the boulevard look like a float
Third video in history to play on Revolt
Yeah we doing our thing I need a bitch with some frame
I need some In-N-Out burgers
I need a blimp with my name
Feels great to be on, but feels better to be home
I just hope the city rep me when I'm gon
Cause I been

[Hook]

[Outro]
Parade (verb)
To parade means to walk or march in public
In a form of precision or attention seeking way
So today we will parade demanding your attention
We will parade and we will celebrate the overcoming of generational curses
That were designed to make our families feel worthless and we will march
March allowing our feet to feel the heat from our beloved streets
Let it seep through every boot
As clarification that you were created to be the truth's at your Chicken George roots
You better believe that
Even though some hung up and tried to ignore our calling
We will parade for our gangs slayed and our faults
Until the day that we fade
Heavenly Father, let us please parade

"Ladies and gentleman"
I now introduce to you the BOW ENT drum line

If you got the heart for it come march for it (8x)
