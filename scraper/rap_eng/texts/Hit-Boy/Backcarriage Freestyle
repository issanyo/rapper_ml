[Intro: Isaiah G]

Lincoln Had a dream x3

All my life I fight for my freedom
Reconstruction amendments man do I need em
I pray that Abraham Lincoln is gon lead em
So I reap the fruits of my labor then I eat em

[Verse 1: J Boi]

Man I got freedom, with the 13th amendment
Remember back, when all the blacks, had to sit in them chains, invented
By the slave masters, screaming we 3/5 of a person
Compromise, that was made, and it compromised all the slaves
And our father’s live was ashamed, slavery legislation
The Fugitive slave law tried to recapture us in the nation
Many years they was chasing, civil war was adjacent
But the 13th amendment, freed all the slaves and now we just pacing saying

[Hook: Isaiah G]

All my life I fight for my freedom
Reconstruction amendments man do I need em
I pray that Abraham Lincoln is gon lead em
So I reap the fruits of my labor then I eat em
Man I got freedom, man I got freedom
Man I got freedom, thanks to all these amendments
All my life I fight for my freedom
Reconstruction amendments man do I need em

[Verse 2: Boi Virus]

Got that 14th amendment, in my wagon, you lagging
Protected under law, no longer backwards of the saggin
Incorporated Bill of rights to all the southern states
Now they can't infringe upon all of the stuff I want to say
My religion is so free, I worship whom I want to pray
And I protest, with the right to assemble and demonstrate
I’m equal, white people, unique flow, im in this
The 14th amendment, important now witness, how

[Hook: Boi Virus]

[Verse 3: Isaiah G]

Do I need em, I lead in the 15th amendment, helped voting rights all get amended
Sent the ballots in the North but in the South they were restricted
VOTING, Jim Crow, VOTING, Jim Crow
VOTING, Jim Crow, VOTING, but now
We got the Voting Rights Act, of 1965
So now the blacks can pick the president in which they like
VOTING, Rights Act, VOTING, Rights Act
VOTING, Rights Act, Voting I got my rights back
Killing every thing from poll taxes to a literacy test
I got voting rights and the white people, are literally stressed
The V.O.T.I.N.G. R.I.G.H.T. A.C.T
Helped the black people to vote and now we do that faithfully

[Chorus: Isaiah G]
