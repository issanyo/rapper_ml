[Hook: K. Roosevelt]
When I'm glidin' in my ride
And you givin' me the eye
Girl, it's alright, baby, you ain't gotta hide now
Just tell a nigga, "ooh, I like it"
We can fall in love, but only for tonight
Anything goes, you ain't gotta think twice, no
Just tell a nigga, "ooh, I like it"

[Verse 1: PriceTag]
Bangin' E-40, ridin' with my shorty
Got seven rings on, I feel like Robert Horry
I'm 22, my bank account look like I'm 40
'Cause that paper mandatory
Play with that, that's another story
My exes hate her but she real cool with my people though
I told her, "cherish this 'cause they don't make 'em like me no more"
And girl, you know what I came for
Legs in the air, Liu Kang flow
Call that pussy the finish line, tonight I'm gon' be Usain Bolt
Now told her, "load the TEC for the boy so I know it's real"
Hit the set with the boy so I know it's real
Get it wet for the boy so I know it's real
I put it on you like no other, girl, you know the deal

[Hook: K. Roosevelt]
When I'm glidin' in my ride
And you givin' me the eye
Girl, it's alright, baby, you ain't gotta hide now
Just tell a nigga, "ooh, I like it"
We can fall in love, but only for tonight
Anything goes, you ain't gotta think twice, no
Just tell a nigga, "ooh, I like it"

[Verse 2: Oktane]
Alright, tell me how you like it
Get it how you want it, baby
The way you movin' that body
I hit it 'til the morning, baby
I lay back if u got it
Arch it up and I'ma make you say
When I'm up inside it, bounce
Give it 'til she can't take no more
Then tell her she can't stay no more
She ain't on my team, don't know my team
No jersey, baby, and I ain't no coach
But you, girl, you the one
And I think I like you too
And I'm leaving here by, like, 3
So if you all for it, then cool
We'll go five rounds, bust six times
And by 7 AM, I rest
You gon' love the way that I ate that
And 9 times out of 10, it's the best
Just know I told you so when I kill it
It's Oktane, the realest
Just don't catch that one STD called feelings
Cause you know that when I'm--

[Hook: K. Roosevelt]
When I'm glidin' in my ride
And you givin' me the eye
Girl, it's alright, baby, you ain't gotta hide now
Just tell a nigga, "ooh, I like it"
We can fall in love, but only for tonight
Anything goes, you ain't gotta think twice, no
Just tell a nigga, "ooh, I like it"

[Outro]
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout. This shit feel like 1990 all over again... So, so listen: It's really just me and the homies, come through the house and hit. Bring your homegirl, grab that cup, pour that drink, smoke somethin'. We're gon' have a good time
Yeah. It's like that
So you can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waitin' for you
So come and put it down like you do
'Cause ooh, I like it
Yeah
Ooh, I like it
Ooh
