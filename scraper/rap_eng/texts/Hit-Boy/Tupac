[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Yeah
Gotta get it right
Yeah

[Bridge: Hit-Boy]
Game go how it go
Can't change that
Still lovin' like your favorite jeans
Hit one time, than you gotta bring it back
Yup, that's how you know

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
I made my heart turn cold, 30 below
Pack full of weather, it's freezin'
Header straight off the deep end
Queue up Kurupt, "We Can Freak It"
One time, we don't do no free shit
Two times, we don't do no free shit
Head on the baseline, I'm so seasoned
Internet niggas like "where he been?"
Gotta tell you bout this crazy turn of events
Managing myself for the last three years
Few million dollars spent [?] at renting cribs
Double overtime to recoup the agreement
Without no infrastructure it don't mean shit
I been getting to the cake, DOLO
Before my deal with Ethiopian Polo
When I was tryna be Yeezy with the polo
Real life nigga, watch who you put your trust in
I can't be your husband, the nigga still hustlin'
Half-A-Mil pendant, got it diamond encrusted
Means get declined if it ain't about the numbers
That's just how the game go
[?] run deep, we ain't on the same boat
We don't blow the same smoke
I'ma stack it up and cop a couple thangs, though

[Bridge: Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy]
Game go how it go!

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
It's no playback
When you the one with the rock making plays out here
Leave 'em all dead is the main idea
Cause they be talkin' bad bout the team, real shit
HS87 who I'm gettin' money with
You can hate me, but the [?] is encrusted
Cards get declined if it ain't about the numbers
Hit-Boy got beats, but for real he a hustla
Weed all out the window when the truck spin
I'ma do it like old dog, keep bussin'
I gotta go home and see my son, no question
Told her come throw that shit in my direction
Fresh orange juice and veggie [?] for breakfast
Got in the shower, came back and I racked it
It rained all day when Trump got elected, so
One time, we don't do no free shit
Two times, we don't do no free shit
I think that odds ain't even
Told her baby, chill, we'll fuck on the weekend
R&B style, she gettin' me the candy
Just cause he hit it, don't hate on the men (preach!)
Two oldschools, that's 75 a piece
But the money ain't shit, it's about what's underneath
I don't change waterfalls, take over the bleach
With the OPM flag, waiving in the breeze

[Bridge: Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy]
Game go how it go!
Can't change that
Still love it like your favorite jeans
Hit one time, than you gotta bring it back, yeah!
That's how you know, bet it all on black and let it roll
Back to the city, I'm speedin', the exhaust is screamin'
Granny used to be off [?], yeah!
Me and my granny used to visit the [?]
To hit the crib in time to watch troop on our [?]
Requesting box videos, way before they had Vimeo
I got shit to lose, can't let you get in the way
I don't chase pussy, I chase deposits at Chase
90210 zip at the new place, yeah

[Outro: Hit-Boy & Dom Kennedy]
Game go how it go
Game go how it go
