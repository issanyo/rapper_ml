[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Yeah everything coming full circle
Ain't no squares in the circle
I can make you stay out past your curfew
Might go star in a commercial
Should I do the V12 or the Turbo?
Just got a new check from Universal
I see it in your face my success is hurtful
You could get it too patience is a virtue
Go gets no gimmics same b-day as Biggie
Slide up to your spot, in a GMC Jimmy
And my main bitch pretty
Show these niggas no pity
Show these hoes no pity
They belong to the city
Neck in neck, with the competition now
Bringing home trophies, that's tradition now
Turnt up in the VIP, I spent a ticket, woah
Watch the way I whip it how I scrape the boat
Nature of the beast, I'm a different breed, yeah
Too busy posted, to post a #TBT, yeah
If we down at the half, I'ma bring us back
If the freaks falling through, they gotta bring a sack
Don't forget the jimmy hats, Henny from the whole bottle, yeah
Eating on China, yeah, put this on vinyl
Your bitch ain't my cup of tea, sayin' she in love with me
Beggin' for my company, I'm watering this money tree, yeah

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Yeah, everything coming full circle
Ain't no squares in the circle
I can make you stay out past your curfew
Might go star in a commercial

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Started with the corn flakes
And a side of wonderbread
Can't push me off the ledge
In the field, like Dez
In them black Cortez
I'm fo' sho', y'all hopin
Got her legs wide open
Don't speak on my name, if you ain't been to Berlin
Ain't bought a few cars, the side chick ain't pretty
Ain't been to Magic City, you know
These niggas just, runnin' with my style, I swear, ay
It's either the GT3
Or the Turbo
And I'm the sign right before Virgos
Parkin' on the grass, bangin' G Herbo
While I chief herbles, you man's a Stevie Urkel
And you couldn't pay me, the role I [?]
I kept it so real, I don't even fuck with vasine
We all finna die anyway, so fuck it, ride clean
And give her good dick, and take her out for that Chinese
Nature of the beast, I'ma different breed
Whisper in your ear, can you kiss it please
Some things were just meant to be
Bouncin' in the VIP, i spent the ticket, woah
Always got somethin' valley, when I'm at the Grove

[Chorus: Hit-Boy]
Everything coming full circle
Ain't no squares in the circle
I can make you stay out past your curfew
Might go star in a commercial

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy]
Started with the corn flakes
And a side of wonderbread
Can't push me off the ledge
In the field, like Dez
In them black Cortez
I'm fo' sho', y'all hopin
Got her legs wide open
