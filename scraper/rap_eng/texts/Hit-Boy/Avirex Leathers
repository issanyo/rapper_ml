[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
Lakers up by 10 and I need some more ice in my shit
Literally...

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
And I know a lot of dimes, they a handful
That's why players on the sidelines can't stand you
Riding solo through the city like Clark Kent
Windows got no tint
Them pretty ass lips keep speaking to me
Like, let the top down, heater on blast
Half-A-Mil on replay
If I ruled the world free breakfast in Avirex Leather
100 percent wool sweaters
SusieCakes eating
Tropical coconut, Veuv' toasting up
I ride passenger if I'm too lit
I lay her on the side, if she too thick
Then put her on top, if she toothpick
Grey Goose pear flavor that's my new shit
Certified, I don't gotta prove shit
In the mall jewelry glowing
While goons chain watching
New year same shit
Til it's over, we we ain't stopping

[Refrain: B. Carr]
Got another drink now the shots on you
Let's play russian roulette for the night
Click clack bang, loaded up
Take another shot, shoot!

[Verse: Hit-Boy]
Grey Goose bottles with the black top
Balling on these niggas since the blacktop
Blacking out listening to The Black Album
Thinking I'm more Jay Z than Pharrell
Tell my niggas I'm the ghetto Andre Harrell
And she like my new songs so she sing to it
Grinding my whole life, my real life theme music
Y'all niggas thought that shit was G-Unit
Niggas rip my swag every year and y'all miss it
Anyway I'm in the city looking optimistic
Marble floor, high ceilings
Hit that pussy with my feelings
Got rid of the feelings, got accounted you can feel it
Take up space in it
200 on the dash let's go to space in it
And Dom came through with the fresh crew tee
And a boat full of hoes screaming: "Rescue me"
Get the bussin' like a chopper (brrr brrr), yeah
Bussin' like a chopper (brrr brrr), yeah
At that Half-A-Mil pop-up, glass in the air
If we ain't got it now, than we gon' get it there

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
And I know a lot of dimes, they a handful
That's why players on the sidelines can't stand you
Riding solo through the city like Clark Kent
Windows got no tint
Them pretty ass lips keep speaking to me
Like, let the top down, heater on blast
Half-A-Mil on replay
If I ruled the world free breakfast in Avirex Leather
100 percent wool sweaters
SusieCakes eating
Tropical coconut, Veuv' toasting up
I ride passenger if I'm too lit
I lay her on the side, if she too thick
Then put her on top, if she toothpick
Grey Goose pear flavor that's my new shit
Certified, I don't gotta prove shit
In the mall jewelry glowing
While goons chain watching
New year same shit
Til it's over, we we ain't stopping

[Refrain: B. Carr]
Got another drink now the shots on you
Let's play russian roulette for the night
Click clack bang, loaded up
Take another shot, shoot!
