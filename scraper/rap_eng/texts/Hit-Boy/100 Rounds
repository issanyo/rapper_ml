[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Get it poppin'
Get it poppin'
Get it poppin'
I keep on shooting off like 100 rounds, brrrt, yea

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Know you came here for reason
Go up on them it's your season
Ball on them bitches how you supposed to
They can't even get close to you
Watch the way my engine set the car alarms off, skrr skrr
Bought them Vickyâ€™s just so I can watch you take them off
Damn and we went so hard last night
I'm just thankful we were in my last night
Take it to the max yeah, take it to the max
Take it to, take it to the max, yeah
20 style ship can't let it ride, lets take another ride
Every time I see you girl its on sight
You fuck with me so hard you book your own flights
Just for the one on one kick back
I feel like I'm in love when I hit that
Usually getting too involved that's a slim chance
But you got that slim waist and a thick ass
With your fine ass I just watched your fifth snap
Busting down Vegas shooting big craps
Big, the only way we do it I fuck with the way you moving
You should hit up the salon I'll pay to make the movie
You could get them 30 inch extensions
Shooting off 100 rounds and extensions, uh

[Hook: Hit-Boy]
Just touched down
She don't like it when I'm not around
I keep on shooting off like 100 rounds
I keep on shooting off like 100 rounds, brrrt, yea

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Congratulations girl you made the All-Stars
Raining in Seattle on my Carhartt
My suite got a view of the ball park
Brand new Stussy know I'm good for it
Just hold your sign up in the stands for me
Them other boys don't know how to handle it
You always keep it solid and mind your business
I'd rather Halle Berry's over Robin Givens
I'd rather take the chance, don't break the plans
Touching foreign sands, unlace your Vans
It get serious off that clear rum
Say you ready for it, here it come
Ay, and we just touched down
We don't play around boat ride at the Venetian and
Pino Grigio and Calamari after that
I bet Kyrie and Lebron go back to back, so
Got it figured out, got it figured out
Who that nigga now, who that nigga now?
Cash credit check, I get it popping
We staying in the room, we ain't going shopping
Leave that 50 bucks for the maid service
Her pussy so wet and I'ma stay surfing
And we went so hard last night
If I charged a billion that be half price, uh

[Hook: Hit-Boy]
Just touched down
She don't like it when I'm not around
I keep on shooting off like 100 rounds
I keep on shooting off like 100 rounds

[Outro: Dom Kennedy & Hit-Boy]
Get it poppin', watch how we get it poppin'
Watch how we get it poppin'
Get it poppin', watch how we get it poppin'
Poppin', get it poppin'
Worldwide, get it poppin'
Get it poppin'
