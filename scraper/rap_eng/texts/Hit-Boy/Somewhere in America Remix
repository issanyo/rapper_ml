Everything is God-like from where I’m sitting
Ride out in that Porché 911 till I'm actually Levin
High as hell, stilettos and pretty women
Puffin cubans till I'm gone, that's the way I'm living

Father told me to work hard - you will be rewarded later
Mother told me to get a degree and the cheese latter
10 years leading all the way up to Nevada
Then we blow it on the strip, yeah, rata-ta-ta

So clap clap for 'em haters wearing span-backs
Fresh braids, pants sagging, Lakers singlet on their backs
Trash talk, leave that to trvsh wang
Do shit, talking do not impress
Snakes crawl, where hell should I place their legs at
I’m just trying to give back what they took away, remember that?
Remember back in forbidden fruit, Eva , I stole that
Retrace my steps, McFly, where my DeLorean at?

Walk all day, yes, I’m restless
20 - I’m young, never reckless
Humanity is overrated - where the hell's analogy
Murder everything manually
Never leaving no casualties
Invalidly getting mad at me
‘Cause I’m the only one try to change everything
Like the Trailer-Park-God, Rabbity, ARH!

I am thrillpvck
This is thrill zone
Imma change everything... thrillmvnity

5AM wake-ups, never sleep on ‘em
Get shit done by 7, life’s transforming
Put in time and get awarded, that is soul food
Everything I’m super saiyan, that is Goku

Uh, ain’t in a position just to be a Priest
White robes, they will never ever suit me
So it’s all black everything
Let me pass the mic on
ET (Eric Thomas) preach to ‘em
