[Verse 1]
Big papa
You dun lost my mother top shotta
Gave you one more chance, and you didn't love me proper
Thirsty
Okay momma give you little water
But no more nana, truely he does it better (uh)

If you wanna talk we can talk about it
But really there ain't nothing left to figure out
And if you wanna stop put your figures down
Boy, I got to go (oh), I'm out the door (oh)

I seen't you, I peeped you
You glassed, you see through
Red flag, but I still believed you
Pack up and move on is what you need to do

[hook]
No more breath to waste on you
I had so much faith in you
You did what you wanted to
And now I gotta make moves, yeah
Boy, you a lil' boy
Still playin' games, you can miss me with the noise
Boy, you's a lil' boy
And I ain't got time for no itty, bitty boys

[Verse 2]
Damn, thought you had plans to be the man
But you too busy tryna be peter pan
Blowin' up my phone, now catch me if you can
But you could never catch me
Red carpet at the ESPYs'
Erased all the selfies, taking pictures with my nexty
Know you friendzoned, so you tryna' be my bestie
That ain't how the gang go
A new nigga in the house like L, L can go

[hook]
No more breath to waste on you
I had so much faith in you
You did what you wanted to
And now I gotta make moves, yeah
Boy, you a lil' boy
Still playin' games, you can miss me with the noise
Boy, you's a lil' boy
And I ain't got time for no itty, bitty boys
