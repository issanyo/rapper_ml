[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
Everybody talkin', wanna give that contribution
I'm signed to Shirt Off Records, she get that distribution
We hit the stage in Houston, she hit the stage at Dreams
I'm going super hard tonight, I'm tryna' make a scene
These niggas gon' pop, I'm poppin' on the block
I hit it on the swing, this life shit up and down
I put her on the team, gotta work for all your play
Man, this rap shit easy, I put them bees to sleep
If you a young nigga winnin' then you just like me
Was 13, walking through the hood, in a fresh white tee
But now I pull-up on whatever, in them leather seats
Oh yeah, I got my shit together, you ain't got nothing on me
They like "That's young CV", oh yeah, That's young CV
Things change she said she see my face on MTV
I run the world I tell these girls they ain't gon' worry me
I'm too legit, I had this chick as quick as 1-2-3

[Hook: Rockie Fresh & Casey Veggies]
I'ma get there in a minute
Not gon' leave until I'm finished
I got that money, I been workin'
And tonight we gon' spend it
And tonight we gon' spend it
And tonight we gon' spend it
I got that money, I been workin'
And tonight we gon' spend it

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I wanna do movies like Busta Rhymes
I make a bitch flip more than the quickest times
These niggas taking styles so I switch designs
And I'm a Jamo drinker I don't shit and wine
Now these bars of mine, get a drink, you bastards
Every track I'm on, Getting REDRUM backwards
I'm rolling in the green like a Trailer Tractor
And I fuck with producers I don't fuck with rappers
I cut my heart open, let it bleed on bass
But I can't be stopped, like I bleed the breaks
I got my money train rolling through 50 states
And I call that bitch Hefty, it got paper plates
Now, the king atcha' chest, better check your mate
I never thirst for a bitch without Oprah Cake
And I'm Driving 88, till my paper straight
I'ma grind 'til I get it, tonight, I'm gon' spend it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Go ahead and put in more hours, money, respect, and power
I told ya, I been workin', we turning up the volume
You get that dough, they sour, we don't do no powder
In a different life, I'm more like Austin Powers
I got my mojo baby, we in that 4 door 'Cedes
You know the good girls go and the hoes go crazy
Said she don't need a man, probably using masturbation
I got my swag up, got my own show, put it on surveillance

[Hook]
