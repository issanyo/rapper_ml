[Hook]
What's up kiss the sky
What's up kiss the sky
Why would I come down before I'm gone, gone

[Verse 1: Mike Gao]
Look, I woke up feeling flyer than some mother fucking birds
And some mother fucking bees
I'm a mother fucking beast
Even Kelsey Grammar say that boy go ham (that boy go ham)
Better bring your fucking camera this a Kodak
Your CD Thursday we throwback, that shit weak (that shit weak)
Man I'm so damn high might reek for a couple fucking weeks (couple fucking weeks)
Uh, man I learned from the lies of the guys who just tried to fucking teach
Aye, that we ain't gon' be shit
I learned more bumping Yeezus
I've been a man since a fetus
I got 'em all like Jesus Christ
My team next, no runnin' up no mo'
We coming up, we getting up fo'sho
Them stars shining, them clouds moving
Them planets balling, them girls calling, but what's new?

[Hook]
