Said it's young lil wavy
Feeling so amazing
Bitch so bad but her swag don't amaze me

It's young lil wavy (x4)

It's young lil wavy
Chilling with the sun
Chilling with the sun
Feeling like the one

It's young lil wavy (x4)

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Hoopin' with my Sperry's on
Coolin' through your stereo
Don't rummage through my luggage
It's a zip-off in my carry-on
I'm feeling so nefarious
My kush gives off the pheromones
These niggas so embarrassing
Man they ain't got no herringbone
Stunting like I'm Ferregamo
My jaw's made out of bearer bonds
I'm living for a fallacy, my palace is gon' perish
But I'm cooling on a terrace with an heiress outta Paris son
Ugly nigga arrogant [?], only in America

Bitch what cha want
Bitch what cha want
Bitch what cha want
Bitch what cha want
Bitch what cha want
Bitch what cha want
