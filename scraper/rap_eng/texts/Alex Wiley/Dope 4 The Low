[Intro]
Just I just
Ooh I just

[Hook]
I just pulled up in your city like
'Who got the dope for the low?'
Who got the dope for the low?
Who got the dope for the low?
I just pulled up in your city like
'Who got the dope for the low?
Who got the dope for the low?
Who got the dope for the low?'

[Verse 1: Kembe X]
Aye, one of them niggas be running they mouth
I just be running my mind
Live these intentions on out
'Cause you can never rewind
Thanking a Backwood blanket 'cause
I get a little too anxious bruh
Used to blow 3 with my dogs
Then grab me two number 9's
My memory been so fucked up
Go out in public and do not say nothing
Took a nap at 6:30
Cannot believe it's already 1:10
This is stoner 101 if you come to L.A. and you get way too blunted
Don't tweak on the 91 you gone end up on the 405
Oh I

[Hook]
I just pulled up in your city like
'Who got the dope for the low?'
Who got the dope for the low?
Who got the dope for the low?
I just pulled up in your city like
I just I just I just

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Where's weed? That I don't know
I just know I need to smoke
385 for the zone (whoa)
We are not getting along (No)
I'm just searching my mind
I wonder what I will find
I'm just taking my time
But I don't believe in time

[Bridge]
Love me Love me save me wrong me
(I keep it on me
I keep it on me
I keep on me on me)
Love me love me save me wrong me
(I just I just)
Love me love me save me wrong me
(I keep it on me
I keep it on me
I keep on me on me)
I keep it on me
I keep it on me
I keep it on me

[Hook]
I just pulled up in your city like
'Who got the dope for the low?'
Who got the dope for the low?
Who got the dope for the low?
I just pulled up in your city like
'Who got the dope for the low?'
Who got the dope for the low?
Who got the dope for the low?

[Verse 3: Kembe X]
I got an eighth in my pocket right now
I feel like I'm my own doctor right now
Fill my prescription go twist up a couple
Just working a puzzle my project right now
Bask in the awesome this blunt full of gas
Foot on the gas
Savagely stomping
They booming
I'm booming
My cannon is sharp
The image is cannon
The damage is obvious
(Low)
Let that bullshit float away
You can't submit to your problems
You got to get it today
This is my remedy
Smoking religiously
Lifting my spirits today
Woke up this morning
Looked in the mirror
And ain't seen no fear in my face

[Hook]
I just pulled up in your city like
'Who got the dope for the low?'
Who got the dope for the low?
Who got the dope for the low?
I just pulled up in your city like
'Who got the dope for the low?'
Who got the dope for the low?
Who got the dope for the low?
