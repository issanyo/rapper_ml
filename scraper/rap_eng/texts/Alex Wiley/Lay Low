[Chorus]
Lay low, all I do is lay low
Boolin' with the gang but I swear it's not a game
Tryna get some shit for free you get what you paid for
Alright, I've been feeling quite alright
I've been having quite a night
I've been living quite a life

[Verse: Alex Wiley]
Wizzle on some other shit
Beam up to my mother ship, I don't like to wait for em
Sacred like the Ark of the Covenant
Admire without coveting, I will save the space for em
Pivot to another thing, I will win the race for em
Looking at the sky and I am one with things
I'm just having fun with things
He live life like he on acid, rolled up dope but he don't pass it
I will never run in place, I'll forever run through space in time
Remember when I used to face them dimes?
You in a rat race a slave till the bottom line
The letter of the law doesn't honor who we are
All do respect your honor you can gargle on my balls
To this one
Do not get involved they told me
Told me that they missed the old me
Can I see what he sold me, this Universe and what it owes me

[Chorus]
Lay low, all I do is lay low
Boolin' with the gang but I swear it's not a game
Tryna get some shit for free you get what you paid for
Alright, I've been feeling quite alright
I've been having quite a night
I've been living quite a life
