[Chorus: Carl]
Saw you out there workin, what you workin for?
I'll show you some work, and make you work some more
Everything is golden, I swear whatever you holdin'
It don't matter unless it's golden
Whatchu' holdin'? Is it golden?
Whatchu' holdin'? Is it golden?
Whatchu' holdin'? Is it golden?
Whatchu' holdin'? Is it golden?

[Bridge: Carl]
And don't be scared, just be golden
Girl don't be scared, just be golden
I see you scared, just be golden
Why are you scared? Just be golden

[Verse 1: Supa Bwe]
I said a prayer
Make me golden
Make all my niggas golden
I feel chosen
Can't loose focus
Fuck em' they want my focus
My magic, my hocus pocus
My talent, my life, my golden

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Take a walk through my garden
Look down at the flowers they're dipped in gold
The weak get devoured, I trip off the power
I just took a shower, that bitch was gold
Infinite gleam, had infinite dreams came to implement change
But my grip got fucked up by these infinite rings
I'm in this bitch cuffin my penmanship suffered these infinite chains cover intimate pain, this life is lonely
Think my wife is lonely, came from rice-a- roni
Cold nights on Stony, to this big ass palace and this big ass chalice
But I might still pour me, some cyanide in the chardonnay
I a die for I fall asleep
Me and my battered mind just parted ways

[Chorus: Carl]
Saw you out there workin, what you workin for?
I'll show you some work, and make you work some more
Everything is golden, I swear whatever you holdin'
It don't matter unless it's golden
Whatchu' holdin'? Is it golden?
Whatchu' holdin'? Is it golden?
Whatchu' holdin'? Is it golden?
Whatchu' holdin'? Is it golden?
