[Intro:]
I see you creepin' through the street
You don't have nowhere else to go
I looked at you, you look at me
Said I just though that you should know, yeah

[Hook:]
The money understands my goal
The more we know to let you know
I might be high, I might get low
With me you never know

[Verse:]
They stuck you through an open window
And took two steps into the dock
My friend, well, no one knows who killed the endo
And I just thought that you should know, yeah

[Hook:]
The money understands my goal
The more we know to let you know
I might be high, I might get low
With me you never know

[Outro:]
