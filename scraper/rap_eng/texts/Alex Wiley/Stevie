[Verse 1: TheMIND]
I guess I'm deaf, I'm dumb, I'm stupid
Cause I can't see when you're translucent
You say I play too much, I'm foolish
Like, forreal, like I'm not even playin' no more, like I really don't

[Bridge: TheMIND x2]
Hi Babe
I know you said your fine babe
But I been feeling blind lately
I can't help but just to
Wonder 'bout you when you're ribbons in my sky

[Verse 2: TheMIND]
I'd say I love you but it's dark outside
I'd say I hate you but the sun will shine
You got me runnin' into traffic
Headed wrong down a one way street

[Hook: TheMIND]
So when my pigment's dark
Who cares they said you goin' to far
I'm runnin' from a lot of things
Got me runnin' down a one way street

[Verse 3: Alex Wiley]
Tired of runnin', no more hiding
Ready for the flood, fuck Poiesdon
Nigga I did it for the hood, fuck your side and
Pardon my [?] but I'm feeling like a young god today
Hey, doesn't care [?] if he fades away
LOL, JK, know you're here to stay
And I'mma say what I meant to say
And I'mma say that I'm here to say
Slay, to slay
The traphouse, the burnouts, with valedictorian ways
Been soarin' for days
Been soarin' for days, embrace the euphoria [?]
We think it's the same
But nigga it's not safe

[Hook: TheMIND]
