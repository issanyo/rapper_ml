[Hook: Alex Wiley]
Aight look ok
Aight look
Aight, Aight
Motherfuckers tryna' dine
That's the struggle timeless
Everybody on their grind
But it don't define us
Tell 'em we on fire
Let me take you higher
We on fire

[Verse]
Pissed off
No wonder everyone's pissed off
Whipping 'till I break my wrist off
Empty pockets make my dick soft
I don't give no fucks about them
Moved away I do not miss ya
Smoking my dope in the mountains
Tripping and sipping elixirs
Wizzle be spinning them scriptures
These niggas suck, like they play for the Sixers
If you don't know me like that, call me mister
Can't believe niggas tried to go against him
Now they like, "So sorry for the mixup" ayy
I think y'all should need to fixup
Driving for greatness my only addiction ayy
I think I see the whole picture ayy
Turn me up
Turn me up

[Hook]
Aight look ok
Aight look
Aight, Aight
Motherfuckers tryna' dine
That's the struggle timeless
Everybody on their grind
But it don't define us
Tell 'em we on fire
Let me take you hire
We on fire
