(Get out my way
Get out my way

[Hook]
Chillin' in the sand, big booty in my hand
Aw man my nigga, it's lit
Chillin' Ima feeling like the man, gettin' bands
Gotta feeling that we finna get rich
Look 'em in the eyes and they look so surprised
They didn't think he'd ever be lit
Look 'em in the eyes and they look so surprised
They didn't think he'd ever be shit

Get out my way, get out my way
Get out my way, get out my way oooh
Get out my way, get out my way
Get out my way, get out my way oooh

[Verse]
I been flyin' high
Feelings on my side, beside myself
Look at all this shit
I did all this shit, by myself
Bitch bye
Ima just get high, by myself
You just want my money, you don't really love me
I could tell

[Hook]
Chillin' in the sand, big booty in my hand
Aw man my nigga, it's lit
Chillin' Ima feeling like the man, gettin' bands
Gotta feeling that we finna get rich
Look 'em in the eyes and they look so surprised
They didn't think he'd ever be lit
Look 'em in the eyes and they look so surprised
They didn't think he'd ever be shit

Get out my way, get out my way
Get out my way, get out my way oooh
Get out my way, get out my way
Get out my way, get out my way oooh
