[Chorus]

Im just riding smoking solo
Solo for a minute
Riding smoking solo
Solo while im in it
X2

[Verse 1]
I dont think we ever die
My energy radiates up through the trees
I am the sky
As you decrease to your demise
Trust your soul and all your eyes
They complacent, no foundation
My shit oh so fortified
Im rollin up the molten Sun
Im high as I wanna be
Im fried cuz I wanna be
I fry marijuana leaves
I tried your diplomacy
Ended up just rollin weed
Im living life so potently
So vivid, lets get it
Yo

[Chorus]

(Ride ride ride ride ride ride)

[Chorus]

(Ride ride ride ride ride ride)
