[Intro]
Whip, whip
Whip, whip
I whip it, I whip it
I whip it

[Hook]
Watch me, watch me, whip, whip
Watch me, watch me, whip, whip
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, watch me, whip, whip
Watch me, watch me, whip, whip
Watch me, watch me, whip, whip
Watch me, watch me
Watch, watch, watch, watch

[Verse]
Bracing through the weaponry
There is no destiny
Nothing is set in stone
Woke up in a bed of gold with a pedestal
Lookin' up better game
Came through looking real lost
Came through out my bars
Can't even light my torch
I don't wanna ever feel frost
No time, you dont even know us, nigga
Live in the frost and I would have been in the [?] nigga
Livin' through G, leaches and bitches wanna walk with ya
I'm chasin' the high just at the moment the drugs hit ya
I value my lungs, fuck swishers

[Bridge]
I came through
Flexin' now I came through
Don't tell me what I can't do
Flexin' now I came through
I came through
Flexin' now I came through
Don't tell me what I can't do
Flexin' now I came through

[Hook]
Watch me, watch me, whip, whip
Watch me, watch me, whip, whip
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, watch me, whip, whip
Watch me, watch me, whip, whip
Watch me, watch me, whip, whip
Watch me, watch me
Watch, watch, watch, watch

[Bridge]
I came through
Flexin' now I came through
Don't tell me what I can't do
Flexin' now I came through

[Interlude]
Amaze the world
I can do anything I want
In based world
I can be whatever I wanna be
Space god
And I said

[Bridge]
I came through
Flexin' now I came through
Don't tell me what I can't do
Flexin' now I came through
