[Intro: (from "The Other Guys" voiced by Will Ferrell]
You don't get it, there is a darkness inside of me
It wants...to get out, it wants to walk around
It wants some walkin' around money, and it wants to buy some shoes
And it wants to, it wants to walk up to people and say "hey
Gator don't play no shit!You hea-you feel me?
Gator never been about playin' no shit!"

[Hook: Supa Bwe]
Welcome to my coloseeum
I got xans but no pillows in my mausoleum
Ain't no windows in my mausoleum
Take your time, I'm alright

[Verse 1: Supa Bwe]
No shade, I'm all light
The other man, wouldn't want to be him
Alakazam, I can show you magic
Play with my food even when I'm famished

[Hook: Supa Bwe]
Welcome to my Colosseum
I got xans but no pillows in my mausoleum
Ain't no thin hoes in my mausoleum
Close your eyes, I'm glowin' too bright
Welcome to my Colosseum
I got xans but no pillows in my mausoleum
Ain't no thin hoes in my mausoleum
Close your eyes, I'm glowin' too bright

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Please, please know, please, please know
Talking bout my money bitch I'm Dr Evil
I need 30 billion and I hope the weed strong
Pinky on my mouth bitch I'm Dr evil
Please, please know, please, please know
Talking bout my money bitch I'm Doctor Evil
Pinky on my mouth and I hope the weed strong
I need 30 billion bitch I'm Doctor Evil
Please, please, know

[Verse Two: Carl]
Ring ring, on my cellular
Smoke rings in my nebula
Black hole my dreams On the regular
Ching Ching need that cream out the register
Everything's a process, count it up
You been looking heartless With no stethoscope, schisms
Idealisms foul rhythms, white light through prisms
My visions of division just the system, please, please no -ism
