[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]

Smoke it till it's gone
Now we on the road for Swishers
Super froze on them hoes
Cause it's cold on the road to riches
But no bitchin nigga
Nevertheless I'm blessed
Nevertheless no stress
Smoke and I'm high
Drink and I'm gone, but I digress
If life is a game, then the god got next
Watch me do my damn thing
Swag Vill on a damn rampage
I live everyday like it's my last day
The Village on my back like it's my last name
Now the team won't stop, the team won't sleep
Til we all on top and we all done eating
We gone treat life like it's all one weekend
And treat them hoes til they all done tweakin
Swag Village we on one, we on one
Tell em quit that tweaking, got that reefer if you want some
Village of proud niggas, we ain't backin down from no one
That's cause we fat ass niggas bitch, so that means that we don't run
We don't run now

[Hook: Alex & Kembe]

All we do is wrap wraps and live comfortable
Drink a Mikes, see some titties, smoke a blunt or two
So put your hands up in the air like it's a pistol present
It's The Village
Triple 7s
Keep it simple man x2

[Verse 2: Kembe X]

I'm seeing South Pole downs, Polo Heights
Mixing hella liquor cause it's YOLO night
Ass so fat, should've YOLO'd twice
Get it in, hit the crib for some solo right?
Flow so tight, use a pencil to pry it
The Vega my favorite utensil, I'm fried
Skip from Wager to Patience I don't know why
It feels my heart so heavy, but my soul's so light
Buy my bitch some real shiny shit
It's all good even though we're all pained
Niggas tryna diss, we don't know none of y'all names
Homie all of that smoke still don't cover y'all shame
Better run in y'all lane
It gets nasty in traffic
It's practice
Shit's real man, we stuffin y'all game
Heavy in The Bassment, abandoned The Attic
Better take the bullshit the fuck where y'all came
Bitch
Flip a table nigga fuck yo meal
Rip the paper, nigga fuck yo deal
550K? You better up yo mil
Til I'm filthy paid, I'mma be trippy mane
And I'm switching lanes up in that Jaguar
Talking with your dame bout what a fag you are
Pray to God I ain't moving too fast, too far
Dear past, please don't put me in a casket

[Hook]
