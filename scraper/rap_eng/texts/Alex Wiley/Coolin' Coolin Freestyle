[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Everybody listen up
The villain in this bitch, come through
Lot of destruction, whole crew
Never follow instructions, young dudes
The party is bussin', come too
By the way, fuck dude, by the way
Who the fu' you finna run to, by the way
I'm in Copenhagen, just cool that i rolled the paper
And blew it, there's no debatin' this dude
Is clostrophobin' his movement
I hope he makes some improvements
I copped, and ate, and do em
It's all a race when i'm shroomin'
Time is basicly just movin
Bitch i'm the face of this new shit tho
They know they nothin' to do shit tho
I hit 150 and put it in cruise control !!
I'm ready for all withdrawals
I'm fuckin' with shorty, she's fuckin' with me, flaws and all
I'm just livin like a colour
I'm just livin like no other
I'm just livin on my mother, hey
I'm just cruisin through the sky
I'm just coolin with no i'on
I'm just coolin nigga..i'm just coolin
Im just coolin coolin...
They gon' ask me how i'm doin'
I'm gon ask em what's it to ya ?
Then i tell ya..i'm just coolin' coolin
