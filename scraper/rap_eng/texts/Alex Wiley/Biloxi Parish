I've been fumbling with your heartstrings and that's good enough for me
And if I've rained on one of your hours I know I must be working
Try it on for size, my darling
See what a man you can make out of me
I will eventually haunt you or you'll eventually be my queen
And I'll be with you through the dark
So that you do not go through the dark alone
Or on your own

I been down Biloxi Parish and that's all the same to me
I've found that nothing truly matters that you cannot find for free
I love you more than I can tell you and when you pass through from this world
I hope you ask to take me with you or that I won't have to wait too long
But until then I'll be with you through the dark
Yes, until then I'll be with you through the dark

And who else can say that about you baby?
Who else can say that about you now?
And who else can take all you blood and your curses?
Nobody I seen you hanging around
Seen you hanging around

And all of our heros were failures or ghosts
Burned out in brilliant explosions alone
And all of the blood and the sweat that they gave
Well, we took it all and we threw it away

And who else can say that about you baby?
Who else can say that about you now?
And who else can take all you blood and your curses?
Nobody I seen you hanging around
Seen you hanging around
