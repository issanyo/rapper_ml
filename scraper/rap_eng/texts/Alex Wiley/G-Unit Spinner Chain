Well if I ain't the man then damn show me where he hidin'
We're drinking and driving styling on my environment
Off of the head I'm off of the head with mine
So come off of the bread or offer the legs you find
Bet it's going down meet me in the club
Trying [?] not to go
Pay me 2k [?] dub in OKC unstoppable
Open the car door see lots of smoke high niggas never see no obstacle
White bitch black tape and these rides is slow
Spend a little jam and I'm out the do'

Picture me rolling
All my bitches is rolling
All my pictures is stollen
I be cat fishing them hoes and
Now all the swishers is swollen
Got your bitch in my plans
And i had them sticks in my hands
And you ain't on shit with your man

I do what I want and nigga this is my life
Standing on the corner getting high getting high
Fourty ounce of liquor nigga bring em outside
Middle of the street getting high getting high
And ain't no nigga finna take whats mine
My G-Unit Spinner chain shining right now

Ooh

Fam in the fucking jam
I Don't give a Damn
Cooking yams in the fucking pan
Spray that shit with pam
Fam in the fucking jam
I Don't give a Damn
Cooking yams in the fucking pan
Spray that shit with pam

I do what I want and nigga this is my life
Standing on the corner getting high getting high
Fourty ounce of liquor nigga bring em outside
Middle of the street getting high getting high
And ain't no nigga finna take whats mine
My G-Unit Spinner chain shining right now

Fam might understand
I understand you think I'm playing
But here I am
But here I am
Nigga damn
You rolling stems
You rolling stems
That's the jam
But here I am
But here I am

I know you hate to see a swagging counting next to dough
Why you out here stressing over how you gonna impress the most
All the niggas sessions closed
All the drinks is extra cold
And all these hoes is extra [?]
My pimping is impeccable

If a bitch mad then a bitch mad
What it got to do with me
I'm a sin bag watching sinbad
Who finna roll these trees
And [?] my spin the chain
And it moves like Sammy Day
[?] thirty four candy paint

I do what I want and nigga this is my life
Standing on the corner getting high getting high
Fourty ounce of liquor nigga bring em outside
Middle of the street getting high getting high
And ain't no nigga finna take whats mine
My G-Unit Spinner chain shining right now
