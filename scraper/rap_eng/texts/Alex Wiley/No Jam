[Hook] No Jam will take me alive x4

Verse 1 (Alex Wiley):
Damn where the fuck was I?
You know I keep two b's rolled
Sour D's and Blue Cheese Smoke
Keep these hoes on they knees though
Like Tim Tebow after he scores
Ask me if I give a fuck, I be like who the fuck are you?
My Master P CD be exactly what imma fuck her to
Bumpin bout it bout it you know I pull out when I'm bout to nut
Better get the fuck around me you know I get loud when Im about to nut, uh
Swaggin as if we couldn't fail
I don't give a fuck about much nigga, as if you couldn't tell
I can't and I won't but you niggas be giving a big fuck
Drinking apple juice out my pimp cup
Getting my dick sucked
Smoke till I get stuck
Wish you niggas good luck!
Cause you ain't got no chance against your mans
I break dance, hit me, Fuck around and break your hands against your mans
Never stress over that little shit, bitch always take it in stride
I lied
When it comes to jams, no jam will take me alive

[Hook]

Verse 2 (Futuristic)

Coming around like a beat off that
I'm in the bottom of grass like snakes
I'm in the sky like Drake's face on the CD case
Annihilate, annihilate, ain't got to time to compensate
Wish you be on that
It go this n***a then me
Big mouth gator, that means I'm greater
If you got weed then put it in raw papers
I've been gold like the candy now and later
Call up your neighbor and borrow some sugar
Who's your favorite rapper, I could pick like a booger
Rappers are signin' these deals, getting fucked
By these labels who pay you  that make you a hooker
And it's crazy, I'm way better
Give me 46 opponents, I'm feelin' like Mayweather
Rappers say they cold, they feelin' like May weather
Me, I'm actually cold, I chill in eight sweaters
Focused on my endeavors, my flow has been kind of clever
No gimmicks, I got no image, no hat in no leather
Introduce you to Futuristic, hi, it's been a pleasure
Introduce you to Futuristic twice so don't forget him

[Hook]
