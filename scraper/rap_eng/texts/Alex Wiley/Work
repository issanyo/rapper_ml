Verse 1 [Alex Wiley]

Fapped and woke up from a nap and found myself asking
Is it possible I'm too fucking good at rapping
They told me get a job, I almost fell out my chair laughing
That shit's hilarious nigga
I'm a nefarious nigga with ambition
So bitch quit your damn bitching
I'm itching for sandwiches
So get to the damn kitchen
I coulda sworn she listened, so my mind starts to wander
Then I ponder
Why you still here bitch?
The kitchen's over yonder

Hook [Kembe X]

What's work to a nigga that raps good?
Drugs? Jobs? 9 to 5s?
Nigga eat a dick!
I'm too focused on bein' rich
Look at! Anyone can do it
Not to mention, I rap really fucking good
Uh, Look (x2)

Verse 2 [Kembe X]

Ayo bitch, what you attracted to?
Is it my attitude?
Cause to be real, I couldn't be up in a sadder mood
I asked my dad what action course a Caston man would take
Pops said, "A Davis had a bastard, sad and tragic for your fate"
That depression shit's a bitch
And I can't fold, no I can't go
For the hurt the lies, the dark facades
A nigga need a heart massage
Apartment lives of plenty never bothered a beast
I feel a spark inside within me, finna harbor a feast
I'm finna author at least
The life I live and how I live it
Spend a day with 20 children
Let me know how I was feeling
When I knew I had a feeling I'd be great, and I'd be paid
For every dumb mistake a nigga ever made
On this pavement to glory and bad bitches with time for all my bullshittin
Girl don't forget:
I'm the rapper, you the bitch
I'm the head bread, kill 'em dead
Ain't never not obtained some shit since birth
That I was worth
So go ahead, make the squad some sandwiches
The fuck you think I'm playing with?
Sophisticated danger
Up the banger then I'm spraying it
You say if rap don't work.....
HA!

Outro [Kembe X Singing]

I'm the rapper, and you the bitch
I'm the rapper, and you the bitch
I'm the rapper, uh uh uh
I'm the rapper, uh uh
I'm the rapper, uh uh uh
And you the bitch
