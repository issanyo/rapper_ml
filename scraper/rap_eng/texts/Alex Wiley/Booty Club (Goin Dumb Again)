[Intro]
THATS ALL MY NIGGAS DO WE CHASE THE DREAM OVER EVERYTHING
THATS ALL MY NIGGAS DO AND YOU CAN SCRATCH ME OFF THE LIST
SINCE YOU LET ALL MY NIGGAS THROUGH THE BOOTY CLUB GOING DUMB AGAIN

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Bad bitch came through with her friend like I told her to
That shit was overdue, I, Think we're invincible
Turning up infinite bitch it's the principle
So fuck they lil monkey suits monkey see monkey do
Guess we just not on that wave
You don't have to be either I'm a firm believer in fucking shit up my way

[Hook]
AS ALL MY NIGGAS DO WE CHASE THE DREAM OVER EVERYTHING
THATS ALL MY NIGGAS DO AND YOU CAN SCRATCH ME OFF THE LIST
SINCE YOU LET ALL MY NIGGAS THROUGH THE BOOTY CLUB GOING DUMB AGAIN
