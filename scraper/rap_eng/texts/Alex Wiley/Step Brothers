[Verse 1: Michael Christmas]
40s and squares to preperate
Then we getting chicken, My everyday mission
Is to gain some new bitches, contest with Wiley
Who can eat the most chicken? It's obviously me
You obviously be, the homo rapper on the beat
Turn that shit real low, you can hear these niggas queef
Charmander the drums, the melody, Charmeleon
Charizard the verse, I'm TerRio, OOH KILLIN 'EM
Mosh pit fucked up the venue now they billin' him
Mom said "WHO made a mess?" now she hittin him
Pops just hopped out the joint bitches feelin him
I'm sitting tryna masturbate in silence, bitches filmin it
Go the fuck away if you ain't popping the box open
Like corn pops, or pop lock and drop with doors open
Mundane, Chris Farley on drunk games
The Babe Ruth of the Bape Root (?)

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Hop up out the bed *YOOOOOOUUUUU*
I forgot to turn my swag off last night
My spinning chain and my du rag off last night
We was mobbin through the street
She was garglin the D
My hands bobbin through her weave
Flippy Floppy
Sipping Saki
Rob Zombie off the weed
Any colors? Motorolas
Let 'em know just what you need
Shouts to Paco
Picasso with the Nachos
I'm definitely interested in investing in them jeans

Wiley busted on this big bitch's breasteses
Faded drunk now I'm finna shake like an etch and sketch
Honeycombs and honey Jack
Money, hoes, and bunny rabbits
Bendin over hoes and
Then hit the hole like a running back
Biaaaaaaaaaaaatch

You don't know me like I'm T.I
Well your hand looks like a (chia?)
But that's the family
