Uhhh
Aye who are these niggas
Trynna talk down upon me?
I don't know?
But I know they got me fucked up my brother
What and I history together made you feel
Like I be the right one to try it on
I'm just speaking back on my xylophone
You call me up you get this dial tone
I hit the booth I get my fire on
It's only invested I only accepted
It goes on my chest
So they don't even question
It's all in the rest
Shut up and listen you might learn a lesson
Give you a million you might earn a blessing
Damn bitch goddamn
And I said no I think I'm a have to pass
Disrespectfully climb in yo bitch ass
Aye aye
And no I think I'm a have to pass
Disrespectfully climb in yo bitch ass
Aye aye
You don't understand me
That's understandable
But why?
Every thing you do
So goddamn [?]
Just know we are the ones
We are the givers
We are the sun
We are the river
Sometimes I gotta
Just look in the mirror
Say I am that nigga
I am that nigga
Ohh ohh oh woah
I'm that nigga
Ohh ohh oh
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
