[Hook]
(All I hear is voices in my head singing young nigga level up)
I don't look at life as a bitch
But if life was a bitch, oh
Life'd be a bitch that I bet I'd fuck
Voices in my head singing young nigga level up, level up
I don't look at life as a bitch
But if life was a bitch, oh
Life'd be a bitch that I bet I'd fuck

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Downstairs, let us in
Rolling up my medicine
Oh wow, you always look down, you need better friends
Educate, self-talk, God gave me the meditation
Levitate, clutch god, masterpiece [?]
I have seen the soul inside of many faces
Pass a bitch a blunt so loud she'd prolly tell her friends we laced it
Time just spent [?] is shit off in your memory-brain
When you flaunt your freedom you the one that they gon' emulate
Keep that lil system
Now I'm fenna go and penetrate, what you got up in your safe
What you got up in your pocket, what you got up in your place
What you got up in your bank? What you got up in your name?
Fuck what you heard
Imma swerve, you can't put me in no lane
I'm forever changed, nigga that will never change
When it's your time, never hesitate
I just hope it resonates
This was a little blunt break outside of heaven's gate
I just hope they let you in
I just hope they let you in
It was a little blunt break outside of heaven's gate
I just hope they let you in

Voices in my head singing young nigga level up, level up
I don't look at life as a bitch
But if life was a bitch, oh
Life'd be a bitch that I bet I'd fuck
