Who is me?
What am I?
Feel like I do this all the time
Is that a lie?
Feel like we just arrived
How am I alive?
All i'm tryna do is thrive
Provide for my highs [?]
I just pulled up on the block
Made a right
I be in another town
Always make my flights
I just wanna roll the dice
Fuck your advice
Some say I ain't living right
But I ain't' living twice

Imma fuck it up
Fuck, fuck it up yup
Fuck it up, fuck
Fuck it up yup
Always in the cut
Twisting up the butch
We already won
I'm not in a rush
Imma fuck it up
Fuck, fuck it up yup
Fuck it up, fuck
Fuck it up yup
Always in the cut
Twisting up the butch
We already won
I'm not in a rush

Imma fuck it up
Fuck, fuck it up yup
Fuck it up, fuck
Fuck it up yup
Always in the cut
Twisting up the butch
We already won
I'm not in a rush
Imma fuck it up
Fuck, fuck it up yup
Fuck it up, fuck
Fuck it up yup
Always in the cut
Twisting up the butch
We already won
I'm not in a rush
