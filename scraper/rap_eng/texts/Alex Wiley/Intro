It's ya boi

Who are you? What are you?
Who are you in the end?
What'd ya stand for? What're plans for tomorrow night?

I feel like I've been lied to too many times
To count, so I won't count
And as I gaze down upon the sky
I see everything, see everything, see everything

Who are you? What are you?
Who are you in the end?
What'd ya stand for? What're plans for tomorrow night?

(And he's gonna wanna know whose going to take away all this corruption and death and pollution
And all these difficult situations on earth)

Look how far we have come, look at all we have done
Look at all we have done, look how far we have come
