[Refrain: Packy]
Be patient, be faithful, be careful
We try
Be humble, be grateful, be honest
We lie

[Verse 1: Packy]
I speak it, they listen, they don't hear me
They tell me I'm wrong
I'll take it, I make mistakes
But my generation relate to what's in these songs
I promised when I got a voice, I would not preach
I hate that
I wanna hear real life shit
When I'm good, and when I feel like shit
When life get heavy, I like shit
Get the wheels spinning like a bicycle
I wanna be the nicest
They said I could'a been a president but we all got vices
My mind racin', I think a lot, I stress it all
If money's evil then feed my people
I'ma make it, God bless it all
God bless it all
My mind is home but I'm less involved
I'ma scribble my thoughts all over this notebook until the question's solved

[Chorus: Alex Wiley]
Running through an ocean
Blinded by emotion
And that's why
This world is making no sense
This world is making no sense
That's why I'm
Running through an ocean
Blinded by emotion
And that's why
This world is making no sense
This world is making no sense

[Refrain: Packy]
Be patient, be faithful, be careful
We try
Be humble, be grateful, be honest
We lie

[Verse 2: Packy]
I'm zoning out
Contract year and I'm holding out
Might never go platinum though
If it was all the money then this would've been an album bro
It's about that and more, I want more than that
Goin' in, cover me like a cornerback
I been runnin' all through the field
Am I gonna hit the wall, this the warning track
I'm like quit sleeping on me, quit sleeping on me
They gassin' everybody else up
I been in front with the tank on E
I won't sacrifice my integrity
I won't be somebody that I'm not to get the cosign and gain celebrity
They can keep it all
When they're home and they're all alone I hope they don't sleep at all
When I look myself in the mirror, swear I can see it all
Do it my way, that's the mission
Get this music out, reap the benefits
Split the profit up, that's the vision, I see it

[Chorus: Alex Wiley]
Running through an ocean
Blinded by emotion
And that's why
This world is making no sense
This world is making no sense
That's why I'm
Running through an ocean
Blinded by emotion
And that's why
This world is making no sense
This world is making no sense

[Chorus: Packy]
Running through an ocean
Blinded by emotion
And that's why
This world is making no sense
World is making no sense
That's why I'm
Running through an ocean
Blinded by emotion
And that's why
This world is making no sense
World is making no sense

[Bridge: Packy]
That's why I'm
Running through an ocean
Blinded by emotion
That's why
World is making no sense
World is making no, no
Follow me into the storm
Follow me into the fire
Follow me into the war
This could be the moment we been waiting for
Trying to make it out alive surrounded by an ocean

[Chorus: Alex Wiley]
Running through an ocean
Blinded by emotion
And that's why
This world is making no sense
This world is making no sense
That's why I'm
Running through an ocean
Blinded by emotion
And that's why
This world is making no sense
This world is making no sense
