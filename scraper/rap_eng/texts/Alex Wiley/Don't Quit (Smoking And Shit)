I roll
A blunt, or a joint.. or I pack my bowl
A one hitter so a nigga can just smack and go
Last time I said that I'd be done my next hit
Faced the blunt the next six
Guess I'm never gon quit

[Verse 1: Kembe X]
The recoverin undercover overlover of the bud
I roll the swisher nice and snug
Then light the snub and take a tug of it
Seems like as of late I been doing it for the fuck of it
No struggle I just love when it
Triggers my brain to bubblin
I'm fried..
Quittin I can't say I haven't tried
But at times, I be puffin for the buzz of it
Fuck it, I be.. high as a fuckin Cubs fan on crack
I told my dealer I'll be back, you can plan on that..
Cause ummm

[Bridge]
Don't Quit Nigga, Don't Quit.. (x6)

[Verse 2: Kembe X]
When I be high, I be observin the fuck outta shit
And when I'm stoned, normal shit just make me angry and pissed
Like how you from the Chi, but you a Indian's fan
Who the fuck got all these bitches wearin indian bands
..You tryna blow to squeeze me into ya plans
If he don't smoke with you, he isn't your mans..
That's how I see it
And I'm never gon' forget my first spliff
Blowin O's of the Oz, nigga this my first trick

*Lighter Flick*

Genesis: "I thought you was done g. Man..."
Kembe X: *Laughs* "...What?"
Genesis: "Man... yo ass trippin"
Alex Wiley: "Kembe, you ain't quit shit! .....Ol' lyin ass"

[Verse 3: Alex Wiley]
The Village be... smokin that other shit
Niggas don't know what to call that
And I cop so much that my dealer say 'Ain't no way you gon smoke all that'
Nigga watch me, we stay smokin
Sticky note gang, we stay posted
And it's like 3 below, but that reefer smoke got a nigga feelin so toasty
And I'm sippin somethin...
Think I need me a couple zips a somethin
Now I'm ridin 'round with a big stupid ass bag like I'm finna take me a trip or somethin
I don't give a fuck about nothin you sayin bitch
I can't hear you over this loud
And if you chillin with
The Village bitch, match a couple if you bout it

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Alex Wiley]
Smokin with Kembe...
Another blunt pearled by the sensei
And my niggas gon get Kentucky Fried, like it ain't a fuckin Wednesday
Not a fuck to give, not a care in the world
Got a blunt in her hand and her hair in the curlers
And we finna smoke that bitch..
Maybe later, I'mma poke that bitch
That bowl packed and that J rolled
And that "Change Clothes" by Jay goin
That flame glowin, yo main goin
She doin the fops if I say so
And for those who's tryna quit, remember the times we had when we lit it..
And I live by the simple phrase my niggas, rehab is for quitters
