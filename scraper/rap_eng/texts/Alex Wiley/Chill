[Verse 1: Thurteen Sounds]
Don't believe in the system of time
Always ahead, I'm never behind
With these elegant lines, I bless the minds
And bless all of mine

I search for what I never can find
Out of the box, Never confined
As the best die or resign
This spot I'll take, The top is mine

They tell me to chill but I don't like the cold
Telling me things that I already know
Saying that liquor is bad for my soul

They tell me to chill but I don't like the cold
Telling me things that I already know
Saying that weed is bad for my soul

They tell me to chill but I don't like the cold
Looking so young but feeling so old
Liquor and weed smoke all on my clothes
Fuck I hope my momma don't know

Cause then that's when all the drama going to go
Crazy, Coocoo, so bananas
I'm just an artist painting art
Can't you see my canvas

Take a look at me
Better yet, go on take a picture
Fuck the bitches, Fuck the money
Cause when your gone, You can't take it with you

I've been reading scriptures
Paint like a young Bob Ross
Everything I touch turn into gold
Music is medicine for your soul

Take another teaspoon
Nigga don't be rude, I'm only helping you
Cause what they show for you, is bad for your health
Meditation for spiritual wealth

Damn, I'm just trying to get rich
Well shit, ain't we all
They murdering
Not only in Ferguson, all over the globe

Niggas kill niggas with weapons and over the stove
I'm tired of killing my own
They tell me to chill
But I cannot do it, when you smarter than them

It's hard to play stupid
I refuse to play stupid
Niggas start revolutions

Get up and fight
Nigga fight for your rights
Nigga fight for what's right

Kill off the hate, What else can I say
I'm the son of the great
All of it's great
What the fuck is this race

That we all running
Swear to Allah
That it's all or nothing
I'm just being real

How you feel
Tell them that the A/C broke
Every time a nigga joke
Telling me to chill

[Bridge]
When I ride with my squad (x7)

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
No fucking thing
Nothing turns to (?)
Riding in my zone
Ducking, dodging the apocalypse
Riding in my own
Finding what this world has got for me
Divide us into zones and complain about dichotomy
But I'm going to let the music come first
I'm going to let your feeling die down for awhile
And I'm going to hit you up and converse
About all the crazy times we had when I was a child
Now I'm going to have to carry this weight
I'm going to have to carry this burden alone now
I know I done made some mistakes
But I stay committed to the path
And it's too late to turn around

[Outro]
Say what (x6)
