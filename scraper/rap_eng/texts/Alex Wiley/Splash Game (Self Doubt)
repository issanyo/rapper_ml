[Verse]
Uhhh, aye
Who are these niggas tryna talk down upon me?
I don't know? But I know they got me fucked up, my brother
What our,history together made you feel
Like I be the right one to try it on
I'm just speaking back on my xylophone
You call me up you get this dial tone
I hit the booth, I get my fire on
It's only invested, I only accepted
It goes on my chest, so they don't even question
Its all in the rest and shut up and listen you might learn a lesson
Give you a million you might earn a blessin'
Damn, bitch goddamn, aye
And I said no, I think I'mma have to pass
Disrespectfully declining yo bitch ass
Aye aye
But no, I think I'mma have to pass
Disrespectfully declining yo bitch ass
Aye aye

[Bridge]
You don't understand me, that's understandable
But why? everything you do so goddamn under handed though
You don't understand me, that's understandable
But why? everything you do so goddamn under handed though
Just know

[Hook]
We are the ones, we are the givers
We are the sun, we are the river
Sometimes I gotta just look in the mirror
Say I am that nigga, I am that nigga
We are the ones, we are the givers
We are the sun, we are the river
Sometimes I gotta just look in the mirror
Say I am that nigga, I am that nigga

[Refrain]
Ohh, ohh, oh, woah

Ohh, ohh, oh

[Hook]
We are the ones, we are the givers
We are the sun, we are the river
Sometimes I gotta just look in the mirror
Say I am that nigga, I am that nigga
We are the ones, we are the givers
We are the sun, we are the river
Sometimes I gotta just look in the mirror
Say I am that nigga, I am that nigga

[Bridge]
You don't understand me, that's understandable
