[Verse 1: Kembe X]
It be all fun and games till niggas get to vestin' up
And niggas get to fessin' up
Shit what else you expect from 'em?
To be real fear get to the best of us, uh
Bad little bitch next to us
She a sideways eight from the chest and up, uh
The good Lord still blessin' us, uh huh
And them devils still testin' us
I ride solo up in my girl's old Volvo with a five up in my gat
Shit was all good 'til I realized (?) vacant just crashed
Fast forward, crack fiends in my granny hallway, ah man this is just fam
Think twice back in South Harlem and I got bitches, nigga this is my year God damn
Pull a Robert Horry, pull a Lauren London, pull a Popovich
Lock in all my niggas
Always talkin' shit so

[Hook: Zacari Pacaldo]
I don't really say much
I've been workin', I done came up
I stay the same, I never changed up
I've been livin' out my dreams, I never wake up
Na-na-na, Na-na-na
Na-na-na, Na-na-na
I've been slinging all my weight working on that paper, paper
Livin' out my dreams, I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Livin' out my dreams, I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Livin' out my dreams, I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Okay first of all the worst of our verses will shit on your best
Put 'em to rest, I'm playin chess
Put 'em in check, they thought it was checkers
Shit is depressin', passive aggressive
Shit is infectious
They in the present, we in the future
Never salute ya, never recruit ya
You cannot see me
I am medusa, Kembe my brother, we got the blueprint
I am intrusive, should of deduced that
We gon' stay around, we gon' stay around
We don't play around, we don't play around
Please don't make a sound while we take ya down
You can't stay around if you gon' weigh me down

[Outro: Zacari Pacaldo]
Na-na-na, Na-na-na
Na-na-na, Na-na-na
I've been slinging all my weight working on that paper, paper
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Livin' out my dreams, I don't wanna wake up
I've been slinging all my weight working on that paper, paper
Wake up, wake up, wake up
