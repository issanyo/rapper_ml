[Into]
I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling diamond
Could've shaped heartaches
Come to find ya fall in some velvet morning
Years too late
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
Zone 4
Get money
New money
It's what you been waiting on
Rich Boy sellin' crack
Fuck niggas wanna jack(THROW SOME D'S)
Shit tight no slack (THROW SOME D'S)
Just bought a Cadillac (Throw That Bitch)
Just bought a Cadillac (Throw That Bitch)

[Verse 1]
We don’t give a shit about shit
Broke down, fucked up, now I’m finna face
And niggas eating chips on chips
Came in the crib went straight to the basement
My phone got tits on tits
Real nigga croppin' out all of they faces
Hit it off of rapping then won’t ever call that bitch
I told her fuck up out my face
I’m way too high for all of that shit and nigga ahhhh

[Hook]
We don’t give a fuck about much
Posted up, getting high
(X3)
We don’t give a fuck about much
Fuck about much

[Verse 2] (Alex Wiley singing in background)
Chillin with the guy, Village be the tribe
(I go crazy cause here is where I wanna be)
Finna fuck yo' bitch, and then dip out quick, be swaggin' on em now
(Satisfaction feels like hella fuckin weed)
You don't like it as I ride, who ??? down to the wire
(I can't help myself - All I)
And the group from the ?? take a hit of this shit and be spazzin' on em now
(All I wanna do is get high)
Village headed to the club
Hella bitches, hella drugs
Hella swishers, hella guts
You know we don't give a fuck
Grab a toaster, hit the tub
Sip mimosas with my lunch
Just a lil Chi-Town nigga from the south of the map
Hella shots of the Jack, and we knockin em back

[Bridge]
Move, bitch
Get up out the way
Get up out the way, bitch
Get up out the way
