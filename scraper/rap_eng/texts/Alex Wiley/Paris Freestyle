[Hook: Alex Wiley]
Come through with a little bit of reefer
Young diva
Never fuck with weak stuff
I'm off the acid and I ain't talking reflux
These niggas mad cause they don't know how to reach us
It makes me sad when I see these niggas reaching
Pull up a chair my son
Let me teach them
We heard your new shit and it was only decent
I heard your new shit and now I need a refund

[Verse]
I'm unleashing the flow
Bringing peace to your soul
I'm a dove with the pen
Stop thinking outside
Bruh look within
I'm just traveling the world
Spreading love with my friends
Hella fans out in Paris
My prayers go to France
Still tunnel vision
Got my eye on the bands
Fly to Japan
Just to try on some pants
Bring a charge on my mans
I'm a lie on the stands

[Hook]
Come through with a little bit of reefer

Never fuck with weak stuff
I'm off the acid and I ain't talking reflux
These niggas mad cause they don't know how to reach us
It makes me sad when I see these niggas reaching
Pull up a chair my son
Let me teach them
I heard your new shit and it was only decent
I heard your new shit and now I need a refund

[Outro]
תנסי לבד הגיע הזמן שתפרחי לעד
אומר עכשיו תשחי לבד רוצה שתפרחי לעד
הגיע הזמן  שתגלי מי את
