[Verse 1: Kembe X]
Uh..
And can we have a toast for the realest niggas one more time?
Cause you know.. The sun don't shine, if son don't shine
I pray my karma don't get passed onto my son though
God, give me protection if I trip don't let me stumble
I can't seem to manage
The damage of heartbreak and snake talk
They make it seem like this rap shit's a cake walk
This Adderall triggers mood swings and weight loss
Stakes paid off, maybe my career'll take off
For now I'm partying hard, smoke my face off
My nigga pass the blunt and play baseball
Takes all effort to protect my adolescence
I feel 30 and the stress to much to fake dawg
Search for my place in this game I belong in
I'm all in
They heads bob til the song ends
And all I conjure up when I get lost in the gunsmoke, a deathwish
I'm just young broke and selfish
Word

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Village shit is getting realer
Put in work so happily
My will to procrastinate just evaporated
Actually been practicing
My raps used to be ever-so-fucking-crappy
Now them niggas just want a track with me
But them niggas is ever so whack to me
Know we're rapping good as shit
But find your way up off my dick
Bruh put a fin up in this tip cup
Or I'm finna send this bitch up
I'm super slapped off that BACARDI Lim√≥n
My raps so fuckin good
Losing your shit's apart of the song
We gettin on
Supposed to be getting focused
But my nigga got that reefer, we hopefully finna smoke it
Village came through fucking shit up and hopefully that shit broken
Niggas talkin that money shit, lowkey them niggas broke
And I REFUSE to be that nigga
I just wanna slap niggas
How you old as shit but you still don't know how to rap NIGGA?
Meanwhile, my writing'll tighten up
Oxy Cotton
And poppin a Vicodin
Light me up, bitch

[Bridge: Kembe X]
And my mama told me that nothing lasts forever
But whatever
I've never given up on any passion or endeavor
And I promise, baby girl we can do this shit together
For pain or for pleasure, you decide
I gotta know if you a ride or die
Cause when the tide is high
You gotta promise me that me and you'll make it through the storm
Carry on
And if so I'm finna slide tonight

And my father told me that nothing lasts forever
But whatever
I've never given up on any passion or endeavor
And I promise, baby girl we can do this shit together
For pain or for pleasure, you decide
I gotta know if you a ride or die
Cause when the tide is high
You gotta promise me that me and you'll make it through the storm
Carry on
And if so I'm finna slide tonight
