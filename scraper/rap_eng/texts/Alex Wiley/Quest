[Hook: Alex Wiley]
I'm on the quest to enlightenment
Don't need no detour
What you calling me for
What you calling me for
(x2)

[Verse 1]
Young Wizzle
It's never been a game
I been with the game
Man I'm on the peace but I ain't scared of the war
Feel your pain had to raise the stakes
Learn from my mistakes
Man you're feeling down just know I'm here with your boy
All I do is seek and destroy
Roll up all my weed and just blow it
Stack some cheese and just blow it
We just bring the feast to the forest
We just bring the heat when it's snowing

[Hook]
I'm on the quest to enlightenment
Don't need no detour
What you calling me for
What you calling me for
(x2)

[Bridge]
Quest to (x7)
I'm on the quest to enlightenment
Don't need no detour
What you calling me for
What you calling me for
(x4)

[Outro]
It's a dream
