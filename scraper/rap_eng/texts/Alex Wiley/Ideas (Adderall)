Intro: Alex Wiley

Dope. Dope. Dope. Dope Yah I'm smoking dope
Aye, Dope Dope Dope Dope

Doctor put me on that pill
Now I can't sit still
Damn... Damn (x2)

Hook:
Try to sit still (what)
Gone through ideas (yeah)
The world runs on ideas (aye)
Roll up my pills (what)
Hold up I'm here
Aye,aye hold up I'm here (x2)

Verse 1:
Sometimes I just need some time to think
Sometimes I just need a place to write
Sometimes I might need a place to crash
The people in my past, see they face at night
I'm coming down Stony if you didn't know
When you see 83'rd shorty make a right
Had an epiphany on the river abode
You fuck with me wrong
You gon' pay the price
And I'll be goddamned if I fold up
Only in the sky
But he knows how high
While he goes down try to decode us
And I'm pretty sure my times pretty close
I-I'm fin' to show it up
For the set nigga throw it up
Throw a sesh nigga show em' out
Fresh mimosa nigga pourin up

Hook (x2)

Verse 2:
Oooohh.... Oooohh....Oooohh
Oooohh.... Oooohh
Oh at times I'm feeling in danger
I gotta better view
High off the better
Still in time for you niggas jockin
Not now
Every time niggas try to fly
Get shot down
????????????
Overnight that instead of you
Try constant intervals
Surprised how long it takes you
To come down
From the high
Off the fucking stakes
When they come round
I'm high
And you're hot
And I'm cool
Okay okay cool dress
I'm impressed
Who are you?
Okay okay that's chill
I'm in town, for the day
Okay okay lets just (bleep)
??? on my way
Okay okay

Hook (x2)
