[Verse 1: Pouya]
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Was you fucking with me?
When I had negative funds. (yuh)
I was thinkin' about you all week, before i went to sleep (yuh)
And when i woke up, still thinkin' about yo bitch ass
The tables have turned, you live and you learn,  you die and you burn
But its all good, im a new man
Yeah I fucked me a few fans, now they wanna take a picture hit 'em with the cold stance
Yuh, you 22 with a baby and a wife working at Denny's with a life
Are you happy with your self?
All this hate in your heart can't be good for your health (yuh)
Now I walk with the limp like a old man, ridin' around the city in a minivan, hitting my phone when you know i know you got a man, damn
I'm trinity in The Matrix Reloaded you touch me imma rip your hand off, this shotgun ready to blow your dick off, these pop going in the microwave get your bitch wet
Cause you know when it come out imma go win, and i'm not here for the fuck shit  dont be mad cause your girlfriend loves this just be happy that i never wanna fuck with her (yuh)
She going keep poppin the pills untill she can't feel her face
She going keep poppin the pills untill she can't see your fate (yuh)
Bitch!

You couldn't paid me attention no more
Couldn't paid me attention
What did it cost ya?
Paid me attention
What could it cost ya?

[Verse 2:Allan Kingdom]
Couldn't pay attention so what did it cost?
Taken in the church like I'm [?]
Could have never been a penny that them panties off
Bet I be deep up in my feelings like I'm digging fossils
Cheese, Cheese, Cheese, Cheese
I be smiling for some [?]
[?]
You would've been grinning had you stayed by me
I'm basquiat, turn you into my canvas but my paints drying
Pay attention to me you would profit
You got a sugar daddy, had a lost lover
Had you been a writer, stick around for me
You would have a sugar daddy and a box cutter
[?]
There is not a stroke that I cannot cover
Made your daddy crazy in his office
I knew we were slipping with them lost rubbers
I know she was slipping when she snapped on me
She took from a baby to a block number
[?] with mad money
[?] cock numbers
[?] witch my mind fascinates
You should never trust them based off their fashion [?]
[?] I was shallow that's why this is happening
You would think [?] made you listen to me
Living through the pen then why don't you sing it to me?

[Hook x2: Alex Wiley]
You couldn't paid me attention no more
Couldn't paid me attention
What did it cost ya?
Paid me attention
What could it cost ya?

[Verse 3: Alex Willey]
Young nigga doing his thing
We don't give a motha fuck what people gon say
Used to the feeling, now its feeling so strange
Used to the feeling, never feeling his face
See he was raised in the ways of the god
See he was raised to observe and abolish those
Ways of the [?] to the heart
[?] steady trynna treat him like a target though
She must've thought he was a goldfish or something
She thought that he won't remember
All of the times that she act like he won't gon be nothing but oh look she all on his nuts
Damn
She said she ready to follow instructions
The voice in his head told him I do not trust it
She might be up with yo rival discussing
So pull over, put that hoe right on the bus

[Hook x2: Alex Wiley ]
You could've paid me attention no more
Could've paid me attention
What did it cost ya?
Paid me attention
What could it cost ya?
