[Intro]
When you on my side, I know I’ll be okay
When you on my side, I know I’ll be okay
I’m ready for the good shit comin’ our way
I’m ready for the good shit comin’ our way
When you on my side, I know I’ll be okay
When I’m super fried, I know I’ll be okay
When my conscience on my side, I know I’ll be okay
I’m ready for the good shit comin’ our way
I’m ready for the good shit comin’ our way

[Verse 1]
Haters' shitty vibes, I do not know what to do with those
Haters' shitty lives, I'm assuming we influenced those
Why they look surprised, do they not know that we do the most
I walked into your party, so long to all the Jewish hoes
Forever uninvited, I do not mean to impose
I gave the world my heart, I hope you think it's beautiful
All my homies squadly, all my homies 2 below
I'm really livin' posi, but I ain't tryna prove it though
Oh, oh-oh
Don't you want to smoke a little dope?
Oh, oh
Don't you want to smoke a little dope with ya boy
Oh, oh
Don't you want to smoke a little dope?
Uh, uh-uh
Don't you want to smoke a little dope with ya boy

[Outro]
When you on my side, I know I’ll be okay
When I’m super fried, I know I’ll be okay
When my conscience on my side, I know I’ll be okay
I’m ready for the good shit comin’ our way
I’m ready for the good shit comin’ our way
