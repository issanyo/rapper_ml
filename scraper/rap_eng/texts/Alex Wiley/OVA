[Intro: Alex Wiley]
I admit it, unh
I ain't really shit, I admit it, aye
Aye aye unh aye aye unh unh unh

[Verse: Alex Wiley]
I ain't really shit, I admit it
Clean scope the scene
Hit my dip then I lean
Pretty curls flowin' out my fuckin' fitted
Hella dirt on my jeans
I got lost in my dreams
And we 'bout to bring that turn up to yo city
Please don't get caught slippin'
We fuck yo bitch by committee, baby
Rappin' in the zone and I'm committed
I've been mackin' on the phone
Ain't been home in a minute, nigga
Talkin' all that bullshit, that shit ova
I don't give no fuck about bakin' soda, that shit ova, boy
Oh, good for you, I heard you're servin' YOLA, that shit ova, boy
I can't go to prison, I be votin', that shit ova, boy

[Hook: Alex Wiley]
Came in from the dark, that shit over
Finished with the past, that shit over (x2)
