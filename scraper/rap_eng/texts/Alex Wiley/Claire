[Intro: Alex Wiley]
Where is she?
Oh my god, Claire!
You look so nice today!
No, really!

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
I push the button, flip the switch
Leave the tables flipped and shit
You go 60 plus in practice
When it's clutch you miss the kiss
Down by one, give my dick a break
Why don't you let a player play?
Ridin' through, you Tyronn Lue
I'm AI with the fade away
Fuck any nigga that throw shade
I was chillin' in a sweater your momma just crocheted
I've been feelin' like a [?] is somethin' I won't say
I been feelin' like a bitch with this beard, but I won't shave
But I was sittin' in the middle
Hate me in the kennel
Throwin' bricks about the homies
They'll break the hunna water, city block, no skittles
So riddle me this
Pick a letter that don't rhyme
But when you goin' do this
They bitchin'
Miss me? Listen
You gon' end up missing
You know who gon' find you? Some old bitch fishing
No bitch, listen!
I'm done with the game
Got the sun through my back
See me off in the distance, damn
Never'll be seen again
Said she ain't dome the squad
Never believe your friends
She told me she on the pill
I don't really give no fucks, Imma just leave it in

[Chorus: Alex Wiley]
I can't even stunt
I can't even stunt we three Suburbans deep
Look like the fuckin' federales when we roll up
I can't even stunt
I can't even stunt if you come through this
Session with a swisher nigga
You don't even know us
I can't even stunt
I can't even stunt we three Suburbans deep
Look like the fuckin' federales when we roll up
I can't even stunt
I can't even stunt if you come through this
Session with a swisher nigga
You don't even know us

[Verse 2: Pouya]
I got a new corolla
Bendin' the corner, doin' yoga
Race down all the time
The engine needs water, the seats don't recline
The AC don't work
The carpet got dirt
I guess what I'm tryn'a say is
You mine so I love you regardless
One man's garbage, another man's goddess
We going through the car wash until you spotless
Push a button just to see you topless
I know the Lambos gossip, and the rovas too
They wanna know why I got a soft spot for you
We'd a been through a lot, had you parked in my spot every night
And we never forgot to turn off the lights
Until that one day, I done slipped up
And that tow truck
Picked up my bitch

[Chorus: Alex Wiley]
I can't even stunt
I can't even stunt we three Suburbans deep
Look like the fuckin' federales when we roll up
I can't even stunt
I can't even stunt if you come through this
Session with a swisher nigga
You don't even know us
I can't even stunt
I can't even stunt we three Suburbans deep
Look like the fuckin' federales when we roll up
I can't even stunt
I can't even stunt if you come through this
Session with a swisher nigga
You don't even know us
