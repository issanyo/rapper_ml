[Hook x2]
I've been climbing, and I'm going higher still
I got priors, smoking on that fire still
I'm admired, if you still admire, skills
Cause I'm tired, fucking with these liars

[Bridge x2]
Still going higher
Still going higher
Still going higher
Still higher

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
This is the part where I show improve
This is the part where they know they lose
This is the part where you gotta choose
This is the part where I remind you niggas it's Wiley who had all the fucking juice
This is the part where I come through wylin'
This is the part where I come through smilin'
Cause I know what it is
They were never fam
They just did it for the 'gram
While I did it for the kids
And I know they got a lotta lies
And they got 'em itemized
This is what you idolize
This is what you trynna be
This is how you trynna move
This is what you had in mind
News for you buddy, not as nice
No, we are not alike
Put 'em in hot water like I'm whipping up a pot of rice
No, I ain't got advice
Everything's new
Everything's fresh, never question
Just listen to the voice that is inside of you, aye
No regrets though
Only regret was making you feel special

[Hook]
