[Chorus]
Oh yes I need that
No such thing as life without the stress
But I need that
Quick to hit you up about the check
Like I need that
Come to me with any disrespect
I dont need that
Quarter P of tree to decompress
Like I need that

[Bridge]
I need that I need that
I need that, I need that
Yeah
I need that I need that
I need that, I need that
I need that
Yeah

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Ive been known to go against the grain
Everybody know Im spitting the flame
Did it once and damn he did it again
Please dont ever fucking get in my way
And I lowkey dont see shit in my way
And i'm lowkey way ahead of the game
Out the cage I can never be tamed
I just keep burnin it
Burnin it Burnin it I just keep learning I feel like Copernicus ayy
Send me the track and you know that I murdered it im not concerned with it ayy
Niggas be talking I won't hear a word of it hot like the furnace okay I am hot like the furnace okay
I just keep turning the page
I just keep burning the sage
I just keep making the plays like why am I musical AIDS
They just keep trying to catch up with the kid, I just keep moving away
Ima just say what I need to say and ima look you in the face

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
They cannot read me they are dyslexic yesa I am just flexing yesa please do not test em we is not stressing yesa
Im in the zone when Im spitting my shit and I feel like the best oh yesa gram on the dresser yesa everything I say I say with my chest dont guess up
Please believe it
Ima just tell you a secret
Promise you never repeat it, I do what I want and I dont need a reason
Goin against me is treason
I promise I never do need em
If its a problem delete em
They dont need a reservation yo wiley will seat em

Tell me what you mad tell me what you mad for
On the mad dash to this cash you and asshole
X2

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Outro: Sample & Alex Wiley]
They cannot read me they are dyslexic yesa I am just flexing yesa please do not test em (we is?) not stressing yesa
