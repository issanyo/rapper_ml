Money on the table, money on the floor
One for the bitches, one for the hoes
Money on the table, money on the floor
One for the bitches, one for the hoes

Man in the Chi like Michael
Not a got damn friend in the crew when dropped out of high school
Not a damn plan or a clue what i might do
Trying to figure out what can I do
Should have joined the army, and picked up a rifle
Should have joined my mommy and picked up a bible and a fifth of shottys
And joined a cycle fuck that
I ain't got no time for the bullshit bitch, fuck that
Lyin niggas ain't trying to cool shit bitch fuck that
Getting known in the world Getting ice cold
Nigga fuck i look like hitting up night school
Nigga rather rap trap titties with these nice flows  nigga

Everybody gotta find their own lane nigga
Cause every body out here trying to get paid
Everybody gotta find their own way nigga
Cause every body out here trying to get paid

Seats way back listening to Anita Baker
Riding by myself smoking weed by the acre
