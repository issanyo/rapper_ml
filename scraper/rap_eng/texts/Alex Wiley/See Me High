[Intro]
I like to chill alone but...
Damn it, damn it, damn it ayy
I like to chill alone but...
Aye, aye


[Chorus]
I like to chill alone, but I don't like to feel alone
I roll another joint or I rip another bong
I like to chill alone, but I don't like to feel alone
I roll another joint and I write another song
I'm just rolling up my dope, yeah
Feeling like the mothafuckin' Pope with his robe, yeah
I'm just rolling up my dope, yeah
Feeling like the mothafuckin' Pope with his robe, yeah
Niggas only ever see me high
They don't care about your soul, oh
Niggas only ever, see me high
They don't care about your lows, no

[Verse]
No, no, aye
We just out here flourishin'
Life can be discouragin'
I'm in need of nourishment
Scared of mediocrity
Your blessings, you can hurry them
Brighten my philosophy, wonder wear my worries went
Drunk in the function and left in the taxi
I rolled up some dope to relax me
I don't know this girl in the backseat
I don't know this world that attacks me
We are not boys, this is not Backstreet
Biting my shit is good for 'em like flax seed
In my own little pocket buddy, you can't sack me, no no

[Chorus]
I like to chill alone, but I don't like to feel alone
I roll another joint or I rip another bong
I like to chill alone, but I don't like to feel alone
I roll another joint and I write another song
I'm just rolling up my dope, yeah
Feeling like the mothafuckin' Pope with his robe, yeah
I'm just rolling up my dope, yeah
Feeling like the mothafuckin' Pope with his robe, yeah
They just only ever see me high
They don't care about your soul, oh
They just only ever, see me high
They don't care about your lows, no

[Sampled from Waking Life]
Now I can fly around and explore all these new dimensions of reality. 360 vision man, I can see in all directions!

[Sampled from Alan Watts]
Cause you've gotta make a move, which will put yourself out of your own control, in such a way that you identify with your higher self

[Sampled from Terrence McKenna]
I think ideas get me high

[Sampled from Alan Watts]
The inner self, the inward light, the real self, the spirit, which is substantially identical with God. So you've got to meditate, in such a way that you identify with your higher self. Now how do you do that? Well, you start by watching all your thoughts, very carefully. Watching your feelings, watching your emotions, so that you begin to build up a sense of separation between the watcher, and what is watched


I like to chill alone
I light up on my own
