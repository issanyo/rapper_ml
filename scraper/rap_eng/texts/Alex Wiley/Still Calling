I'm calling out to you
I'm hopelessly confused
I'm jumpin off the roof
I'm calling
She dances through my mind
She's taking her sweet time
I ignore all the signs


I'm calling out to you


I'm calling out to you
I'm hopelessly confused
I'm jumpin off the roof
I'm callin
She dances through my mind
She's taking her sweet time
I ignore all the signs



I'm calling out to you

So please cover all your bases
Anyways
Anyways
Anyways
Anyways

So please cover all your bases
Anyways
Anyways
Anyways
Anyways


[Verse]

Call me on the celly
Whats really real
Watch your belly on repeat
Ready ever off the beat
Have you ever been so lost
Up in emotions lately
Ive been feeling the defeat
I retreat
Take a seat


I've only ever been about it
In the streets
I've only ever been about it
In the sheets

Keep it sweet
Take a seat
Lost up in my mind
Id be lying if i told you you were mine

I would define  you

Never really had time to decide

See that's visions of love

Im feeling it now
This how we get down

This may be the reason i keep myself
To myself


Its really fun and games
If you look at it now
Yall niggas
Missed conumdrum paris

Yall don't be mistaken by the way i move
I might be out of my mind
I'm still keeping the groove
I'm still  keeping it true
I'm still out of my mind
But I'm still keepin it cool
Im still keepin it you
You you you


[Chorus]

Im calling out to u
Im hopelessly confused
Im jumpin off the roof
Im callin
She dances through my mind
Taking her sweet time
I ignore all the signs

Im calling out to you

Im calling out to u
Im hopelessly confused
Im jumpin off the roof
Im callin
She dances through my mind
She's taking her sweet time
I ignore all the signs

Still calling


So please cover all your bases
Anyways
Anyways
Anyways
Anyways

So please cover all your bases
Anyways
Anyways
Anyways
Anyways

[Outro]
