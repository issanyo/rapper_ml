[Chorus 1: Nick Carter Green]
Aw man
Goddamn, goddamn
Don’t touch a chain around my neck
Don’t touch a ring on my hand
Someone tell this stupid bitch
Cause she don’t know who I am
Just pretend, aw man
Goddamn, goddamn

[Verse 1: YP]
Said aw man
Aw man, goddamn
Most of my niggas selling dope
The other niggas do scams
I keep a tommy on my hip
My bitches thicker than Pam
Fuck a selfie
I make a living posting up selling grams
Said aw man
I bet that they know me well
Ask around and I bet that say I’m standup like Dave Chappelle
I was younger when I was smoking blunts with Bump on Chappel
Kept a hammer because you never know who you got to nail
I be grinding AM to PM
Hustlers wish they could be him
I don’t fuck with niggas who got customers through a DM
Social media know you got so and so on the pull up
Get the fuck from ‘round me
When I got it, you was in pull-ups

[Chorus 1: Nick Carter Green]
Aw man
Goddamn, goddamn
Don’t touch a chain around my neck
Don’t touch a ring on my hand
Someone tell this stupid bitch
Cause she don’t know who I am
Just pretend, aw man
Goddamn, goddamn

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Aye, aye
Smoke a lot of dope
Lying under oath
It is Young Wizzle the goat
These niggas already know
I said it, they spit in quotes
Same nigga from before
Same nigga with the flows
Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
Supreme on my sweatshirt
Bless her, just don’t stress her
Rolex on my dresser
Bitch, I ball like Weber
Trying to ball forever
Never sign, no, never
Oh, I think I’m clever
Back down with a lot of weight
You gon’ have to wait
Think I hit the fucking lottery, aye, aye
I’m back down with a lot of weight
You gon’ have to wait
Swagger need to wait
I’ma need a safe

[Chorus 1: Nick Carter Green]
Aw man
Goddamn, goddamn
Don’t touch a chain around my neck
Don’t touch a ring on my hand
Someone tell this stupid bitch
Cause she don’t know who I am
Just pretend, aw man
Goddamn, goddamn

[Bridge: Rockie Fresh]
Young nigga doing big things
They see me vibing
See me moving when I switch lanes
These white people thinking that a nigga serve ‘caine
These white people thinking that a nigga serve ‘caine
I told them—

[Reprise: Nick Carter Green & Tati.Elicia]
Be my controlla
Girl, give your soul up

[Verse 3: Nick Carter Green]
Fuck all that talking till payment
Man, fuck what they call it
I’m calling it Haley
I’m calling up Haley
I’m calling on two lines
Two lines lined up
Two sides of the story, pardon
Honestly, at least it wasn’t arson
I prairie’d Scott but not at Carson’s
Was very hot, we got it scorching
My only type is kind of gorgeous
Just take these drugs and lay it back
Hit your type without the hat
Put that pussy on the map
That’s ScHoolboy Q and A
You and me, PDA
SAT GPA
Just give me brain, give me brain
With this pinky in your butt
She know I don’t really give a fuck
(She know I don’t really give a fuck)
Talk all that gangster shit that you wanna talk
You only breathing ‘cause of her
She know don’t leave it up to us
(She know don’t leave it up to us)
Got restraining orders on restraining orders
And I’m still buying what my lady ordered
My old lady from the D
(Aye Nick, ain’t Haley from the D?)
She went so crazy on the D
I might have a baby in the D
Aye nigga, please don’t play with me
(Aye nigga, please don’t play with me)
Aye, ‘cause I’m still the hardest out
What the fuck you talking ‘bout, bitch?
(I know, I know)
(You’re hot, I’m cold)
(Ignore my texts)
(That’s not a yes)
(But not a no)
Wait—

[Verse 4: Nick Carter Green]
Yo, I might need this double stacked
Call her once, won’t call her back
My little bitch, if you’d call her that
Got pregnant and I heart-attacked
She just trying to lock it, lock it down like it’s cardiac
I’m not trying to dog you
But I got my collar back
I jump out like Bruno with the funk
Fuck her at mama house
While arguing over nothing, nigga
I feel like Phil Collins with the drum
Shantierra would’ve done it
But Abria’s where I cum
And these niggas been talking that
Way too long now
Bitches been talking that
Way too long now
They can keep talking but I won’t back down
They can keep talking but I won’t
Don’t you think it's funny how it goes?
Dead it
I’d smack you like I’m Diddy
But I’ll spare you like I’m Britney
‘Cause ya’ll got me cracking up here more than Whitney
How y’all talk it but I lived it
Spit to blues like you cripping
While papi got it popping out of fear, yeah
Twin bitches popping in the Lear, yeah
So please don’t think I’m motherfucking queer
Or I’ll pack you motherfucking rear, vroom
Niggas mad switching up
Bitches mad, snitch enough?
Trigger fingers twitching up
Had twitter trying to mention us
I almost, I almost did a bit but I biggened up
So please stop blocking me on your ‘gram like a give a fuck

[Chorus 2: Nick Carter Green]
Niggas been talking that
Way too long now
Bitches been talking that
Way too long now
They can keep talking but I won’t back down
Turn this motherfucker into back to back
Niggas been talking that
Way too long now
Bitches been talking that
Way too long now
They can keep talking but I won’t back down
They can keep talking but I won’t back down, no
