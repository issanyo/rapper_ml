[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, they said it wasn't no place for me
But you can’t even play too hazily dog
Shit beat too wild, I hate to be so
She 18 years old, she basically grown
So why they get big and we take a bit
All of the rest get all of my bended
Don’t need no baby, no need no tip, God damn
'08, '09 nigga got no looks, nigga got no shine
On that put nigga shut your damn
Nigga put your diam in that porch and the rarest porsches
In this world nigga ain’t important
They got rules but they can’t enforce `em
New baby but she ain’t as gorgeous
And the boys so I came endorse her
On this gate gonna straight and force us
At the end of my haze is forcing
Put the lines and the haze and will get awsome
Never fuck, never save in old brudge
But in days in nature will far us
Getting bay to erase the browsers
Fucking yo emotions, have a mamosa grab ya a coaster yeah

[Verse 2: Kembe X]
Told my bitch truly I love you, but surely
Your nightmares are gonna be premiers all because
Your head in the cloud, my head in the stars
This bitches bad and these bitches heartless
Me? I’m no pan handler, I’ll be refusing to beg your pardon
Me while your nigga try to party
To say that’s the same party
Long as I live with a arm full of [?]
Martin Luther King with a dream of a house and a forest
And a garage full of foreigns
Bitch for the square and the cup full of lean and a bust for the morning
Wait for that all but you better believe that I fall, back, back, back on it
Til that label to quit that bonie
And the vans, tell me to stuck all this Benz
And I’mma make great part with this Benz
And I go cop that something else
I’m gonna pull up and you know what
And paint it cream, and do fucking go nuts
Go nuts

[Hook]
