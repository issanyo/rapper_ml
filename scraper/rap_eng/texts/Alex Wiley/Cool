[Intro: Alex Wiley]
Mmm
Mmm, whoa
Mmm, whoa

[Chorus: Alex Wiley]
Cooling, smoking, there he go (ah, ah, ah)
Cooling, either way it go (ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ooh wa)
Cooling, smoking, there he go (ah, ah, ah)
Cooling, either way it go (ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ooh wa)

[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
Pop the collar on my polo like I thought of that
Only ride with Thoroughbreds like we was playing polo
Fuck Shapiro, that's not just for promo
Pull up on your whole squad dolo
[? 0:51] in this Raf Simons
And ain't my pace, I know my cash different
Rap niggas smile in your face, then act different
I can't call it, shit
But I'm too deep in my wallet to but that deep in those feelings
See no ceilings when I look up
Etch A Sketch flows got Chicago shook up
Take note! The trees [? 1:10] and when I cook like I don't need a apron
Don't want no smoke, they blowin' smoke, man, all I see is vape pens
Bitch, really, it's truth, now, can I get a Amen?
Come through flossing like your pastor on Easter
Keep the sauce in Alabaster box, your stamp's in my visa
Cramps in my fingers and this scheme on my Visa
My pass as the Shiba
We rollin' raw, it's never Swisher Sweets
We don't do Swisher Sweets

[Chorus: Alex Wiley]
Cooling, smoking, there he go (ah, ah, ah)
Cooling, either way it go (ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ooh wa)
Cooling, smoking, there he go (ah, ah, ah)
Cooling, either way it go (ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ooh wa)

[Verse 2: Calez]
Cooling, smoking, there he go
Wait, I'm cool, outspoken, very woke
I read the scenario: She try and milk my account just for them Cheerios
That dairy feta
Yeah, that's why I met her on Ontario
I bury treasure
Bought a pair of these, these not no Perry Ellis
Katy Perry, sippin' on dark horse
My bitch took off them leathers, she gon' shake it
(She gon' shake it, she gon' shake it)
We gon' get off together
This ain't no movie scene, but bring a extra
Now, here's a lecture: y'all can't fuck with my texture
This for those out there that think y'all blocking my blessings
Young black boy from the bottom, I should cover essence
I was sick and stressing, so I just started finessing
Yeah, cooling, smoking, there I go
I can barely even smoke in peace, they watch me everywhere I go
You say you love me, yeah, I know
You don't love me yet until you show me where that money at (yeah)

[Chorus: Alex Wiley]
Cooling, smoking, there he go (ah, ah, ah)
Cooling, either way it go (ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ooh wa)
Cooling, smoking, there he go (ah, ah, ah)
Cooling, either way it go (ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ooh wa)
