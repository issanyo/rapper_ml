(Thirst thought you my)
Hang if you wanna come hang
We can roll up 10 thangs if you wanna
They know what I be on
Not no fucking styrofoam
They know what I be on straight marijuana
(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I was 16 it came a little bit close to killing myself
I apologize when I came on the other side
I was feeling myself
That's my shit that's nothing thay you got to deal with
I just figured I stay on some real shit, some for real shit here
I feel like I can do anything as long as I'm not being lazy
(Oh ya,ya,ya,ya,ya)
I feel like I can do anything as long as these niggas don't play me though
(Oh ya,ya,ya,ya,ya)
I feel like I can do anything as long as I stay by my lonely
(Oh ya,ya,ya,ya,ya)
I feel like I can do anything as long as they don't really know me though
(Oh ya,ya,ya,ya,ya)

[Hook]
You know where to find me
You know where to find me
You know where to find me
You know where to find me
You know where to find me
But maybe you don't

If you need me you can meet me on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
If you need me you can meet me on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 2]
I remember really feeling way down
I'm stuck with my army now
I'm stuck in my highs like la-la-lalala-la-la-la

I hear the voices they come from my niggas
They just want to tell me lies
Niggas be hating so hard on the boy and they can't even tell you why
But I don't be giving a fuck what they're saying
I've said that a million times
I don't be giving a fuck what they're saying
I've proved that a million times
But hey all that I pray
Is that we remain unphased, unscaved oooohhhhh
Hey all that I pray
Is that we remain unphased, unscaved ehhhh

You know where to find me

But maybe you don't

If you need me you can meet me on top of the world

I'm on top of the world
If you need me you can meet me on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world

[Hook]
You know where to find me
