[Intro:]
Everyone's invited
Everyone's Invited
Whoa oh ho
Whoa oh ho
Everyone's invited
Everyone's Invited
Whoa oh ho
Whoa oh ho

[Verse 1:]
When you're in love, you see (Welcome to my party)
Jumping beneath the zarro befarro
Maybe you'll see
The world I tried to show you, It's wonderful
Maybe you'll see (Welcome to my party)
We're jumping beneath us, I hope you fall
Maybe you'll see
The world I tried to show you, It's wonderful

[Chorus:]
Maybe you'll see
Maybe you'll see
Maybe you'll see
Maybe you'll see

[Verse 2:]
I clean my feet, I clean my dress
I pour peroxide on my soul
I keep my teeth really pearly white
I like my necklace wrapped in gold
I need a couple million dollars
Now watch that heart start to corrode
These fucking leeches take their time
And after a while they take their toll
They'll drain you dry (drain you dry)
Time kills slow (time kills slow)
And it don't matter if you're clean or dirty [?]
There's a monster in every motherfucker
Shh, I think they heard me

[Verse 2:]
I clean my feet, I clean my dress
I pour peroxide on my soul
I keep my teeth really pearly white
I like my necklace wrapped in gold
I need a couple million dollars
Now watch that heart start to corrode
These fucking leeches take their time
And after a while they take their toll
They'll drain you dry (drain you dry)
Time kills slow (time kills slow)
And it don't matter if you're clean or dirty [?]
There's a monster in every motherfucker
Shh, I think they heard me
