[Hook]
Smokin' hella dope but that's okay
Lonely lil' stoner boy, doping in the corner boy, I hope they let him slide
Smokin' hella dope but that's okay
Lonely lil' stoner boy

[Bridge]
I'm trying to rise above the frame
I must admit I'm proud of that
But they just trying to bring me down
And I cannot get down with that (2x)

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
This life of mine is forever in my palm
Escaped up out the basement, and that is where my days went
This life of mine is forever in my palm
Had a vision, traced it, they tried to erase it
This life of mine is forever in my palm
Why is it my eyes might cry as I lie, awake?
This life of mine is forever in my palm
Feeling like if I must die, I'ma die my way
This life of mine is forever in my palm
Why is it my eyes might cry as I lie, awake?
This life of mine is forever in my palm
Feeling like if I must die, I'ma die my way
This life of mine is forever in my palm

[Hook]
