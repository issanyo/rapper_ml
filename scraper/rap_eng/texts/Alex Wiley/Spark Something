[Hook]
Maybe we can spark something
Maybe we can spark something

[Verse]
Do you wanna see what I see?
Do you wanna be like me? Hope not
I came from the land where the rain dont stop
So get live in his face
He was trying to escape
But his clipped wings can’t go far
Trip but he ain’t gonna fall
Look to the sky as a guy
But there ain’t no stars
I am the god
We are the gods
I am the sun
We are the stars
Ain't no defeating me
I am the deity
What do you see in me God?
I know I seem to be lost
But I know I’m free to be lost

[Bridge]
Rollin apart my dope
Wanna smoke my dope
In different places
Now when I'm chiefin
Fuck nigga I just see blurs
I dont see no faces
Im just, rollin apart my dope
Wanna smoke my dope
In different places
Now when I'm chiefin
Fuck nigga I just see blurs
I do not see no faces
Man

[Hook]
