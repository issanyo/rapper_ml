[Verse 1]
Scratched the surface, serve this work
Serve the verse then serve the clerks
Hot enough, I served it burnt
Learned the word, we growing herb
We service earth, just call me first
This is how we work
Pay me first and serve it like it's Andy Roddick bagging up
Steal the base and tag it up
Bitch, you catching, called beginner's luck
And I keep it tucked and running screens in the key
Bass line with the scoop and then I call it how I see
In a house, just put the roof in and we watching on TV
A duck could give a quacking fuck about a chicken shit
I was reading when I seen it, then I thought I heard this
Seen that bird flip, get this turned in
[?]

[Chorus]
Say I'm the man, I'm the man
Homie, I can't fucking stop
I been running, I been smoking
I came for the fucking guap
(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)
I'm the man, I'm the man
Homie, I can't fucking stop
I been rolling, I been smoking
I came for the fucking guap
(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)

[Verse 2
I'm the man, I'm the man
Bitch, you know that I'm the man
Breaking down my cigarillo
Pinch the dope, I roll a grand
Save money the fams, spend 600 on them pants
Homie, you ain't even know it
Probably don't even understand
Why all these niggas on my jock
And all these bitches on my dick
And all these haters hating on me
Wanna be down with the clique
Cause they know that I'm the shit
And there ain't shit that they can do
We leave you stretched out in the street
You tryna get down with the crew
All designer on me, Burberry on me (Take that)
Louis V on me, I'm smoking on OG
I'm smoking pote 'til I OD
Took your girl, she left you lonely
You talking 'bout it to your homie
Don't tweak nigga, everybody know me
Stay 100 to the grave
Keep a part up in my fade
There's some ones up on my feet
You know I'm good up in these streets
Stay 100 to the grave
Keep a part up in my fade
There's some ones up on my feet
You know I'm good up in these streets

[Chorus]
Say I'm the man, I'm the man
Homie, I can't fucking stop
I been running, I been smoking
I came for fucking the guap
(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)
I'm the man, I'm the man
Homie, I can't fucking stop
I been rolling, I been smoking
I came for the fucking guap
(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)

[Chorus]
Say I'm the man, I'm the man
Homie, I can't fucking stop
I been running, I been smoking
I came for the fucking guap
(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)
I'm the man, I'm the man
Homie, I can't fucking stop
I been rolling, I been smoking
I came for the fucking guap
(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)(Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh)
