[Verse 1: Calez]
This shit too ridiculous, chronicles of ridderick
Money in that safe and now that foreign is illiterate
Skrrr, Skrr, all the time, my new ghost spaceship
I'm livin in 2080, boy that's just my gang shit
I'm just on my fame shit, Wiley drop that flame shit
Now we cross the border with it visas for your main bitch
Take a couplet when I spit it, I sing for an angel
I know you in danger, when you see us pull up in that

[Hook: Alex Wiley]
Navigator truck, never gave a fuck, no
You can hit my blunt, cuz I'm rolling big ol' blunts dawg
If you wanna come through, you can hit my telephone
She know I be hella here, look up I be hella gone
Navigator truck, never gave a fuck, no
You can't hit my blunt, cuz I'm rolling big ol' blunts dawg
If you wanna come through, you can hit my telephone
She know I be hella here, look up I be hella gone

[Bridge: Calez]
And I like how you feel in my Chevy
And I like how you feel in my ride
And I like how you feel in my mind

Bitch I'm way, way, way up
Bitch I'm going way up
You niggas is layups
Nigga, get your weight up
Way, way, way, up
Bitch, i'm going way up
Ya fuck me on my way up
And we never forgave ya

[Hook: Alex Wiley]
Navigator truck, never gave a fuck, no
You can't hit my blunt, cuz I'm rolling big ol' blunts dawg
If you wanna come through, you can hit my telephone
She know I be hella here, look up I be hella gone
Navigator truck, never gave a fuck, no
You can't hit my blunt, cuz I'm rolling big ol' blunts dawg
If you wanna come through, you can hit my telephone

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Just let that shit breathe...
Scooter from Madonna
Dinner with Obamas
We just hit Hawaii, Ohana
Comma, comma, comma
I keep all the commas
I don't have to log in, I ain't never sign up
Just let that shit resonate, I need a girl like Tessa Mae
I just added pages to my resume, like yesterday
My project look like science fair, your project look like section 8
Homies hit your session late, your engineer like smh
Just let that shit breathe...
Hesitate, I don't have to guesstimate
Why you wanna mess with me?
Sittin' with the recipe, right next to me, like just you wait
I just need to situate
Never get why yo bitch ass investigate

[Hook: Alex Wiley]
Navigator truck, never gave a fuck, no
You can't hit my blunt, cuz I'm rolling big ol' blunts dawg
If you wanna come through, you can hit my telephone
She know I be hella here, look up i'll be hella gone

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
Just let that shit breathe
