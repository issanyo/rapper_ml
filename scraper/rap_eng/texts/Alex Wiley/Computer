[Verse 1: Supa Bwe]
I don't hate my Papa
Though I did when I was little
Tried to meet him halfway, but God was in the middle
Man fuck this interview, I grew up with killers you don't know real niggas
Told her fuck her attitude bitch I'm out here grindin', I am not a human
I'm supposed to be here y'all are the intruders
I'm supposed to be here y'all are the intruders

[Hook: Alex Wiley]
I am not a human, I am more computer, I do not compute you
Pew pew, might have to shoot ya
Pew, pew ,pew might have to shoot
I am not a human, I am more computer, I do not compute you
If my squad do not compute you

[Verse 2: Supa Bwe]
Pew pew, now pass to Supa
Shots like I'm Curry, uh
Who the fucked killed Tony
Too soon I had to do it
I'm too dope I had to prove it
Cause baby I'm a warrior
Shots like I'm Curry uh
Getting drunk to my own music
Cause I make music for computers
I am not human no
I am cold metal uh
Baby I'm the shooter
I'm too cool I don't make music
A true fool, I'm goin stupid uh
Full moon I'm goin monkey uh
Packed room here for Supa

[Hook: Alex Wiley]
I am not a human, I am more computer, I do not compute you
Pew pew, might have to shoot ya
Pew, pew ,pew might have to shoot
I am not a human, I am more computer, I do not compute you
If my squad do not compute you

[Verse 3: Saba]
I don't do dial tone so, when a real nigga call your phone, answer it
Moms in the ambulance, I speak in sirens, my sinuses acting up
The spring is back again
If and when this computer boot up
I grew with shooters like Duke Nukeem, bitch I'm not a human
Out west coolin boolin', practice what we preachin'
Church is on the move, and church just let out early
I ain't been since I was 10
I invented with a pen
Kill a sentence with a sin
Download this shit with a click
Write a written with the whip
Squeaky regal William regal
They dial up and we like wireless
Handsome pay some pretty prices
Don't trade your dreams for security
You gon' need Norton cause that shit a virus

[Hook: Alex Wiley]
I am not a human, I am more computer, I do not compute you
Pew pew, might have to shoot ya
Pew, pew ,pew might have to shoot
I am not a human, I am more computer, I do not compute you
If my squad do not compute you
