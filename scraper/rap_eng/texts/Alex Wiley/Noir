[Verse One: Straightface Forever]

You niggas is cartoons
A bunch of whales trying to dodge the tip of this harpoon
Lets switch up the costume
Everybody trapping out the shed til the feds is at your door
And your homies on the floor
Another bites the dust karma waiting at the cusp
Got you jumping off a cliff because you running from your bluff
And all because a dollar and to hear some ladies holler
Ever wonder where the fuck your leeches go when you ain't got it?
We at the cross roads bruh its getting tough
Ameriklan hunting us down to get a rush
Yeah my people standing their ground we've had enough
Innoculated with self respect and fearing none
Run from your friends with the knives in they hands
Never leave your square without a 9 in your pants
You niggas aiming at now my sights are set on forever
Sell your soul for a retweet and repeat until you vanish
Begging for relevance you sucking dick to get noticed
Renting foreigns and floating and still ain't notice you've blown it
Im here to kill all you niggas remake you and son you healthy
This rapping shit gonna get messy
It's gonna get messy

[Hook: Alex Wiley]

Whoa-oh
Please don't fight it the light so blinding
Got pulled over smelled my weed but he couldn't find it
Young wizzle grinding
Young wizzle grinding
Was eighteen snake deal Young Wizzle signed it
Please don't remind me ooh they was grimy
At least god got me out the jam in perfect timing
Had to peep the set up
I will never let up
Do a song once it'll haunt you forever

[Bridge: Straightface Forever]
Hit the scene nothing in my pocket but a dream
Want to get the cream but these niggas want to lean against the door
Hit the floor nigga I'm taking everything you got and I want more nigga
Get on the wall watch me ball til tomorrow nigga
Bigger figure than your biggest spender paradise is elbow in the rim
Squad is looking like a holy brothers grimm
Father I've been trying to play it cool but all I'm finding here is sin

[Hook: Alex Wiley]

Please don't fight it the light so blinding
Got pulled over smelled my weed but he couldn't find it
Young wizzle grinding
Young wizzle grinding
Was eighteen snake deal Young Wizzle signed it
Please don't remind me ooh they was grimy
At least god got me out the jam in perfect timing
Had to peep the set up
I will never let up
Do a song once it'll haunt you forever
Boy whats wrong
Boy whats wrong
Wonder why a nigga don't sleep no more
Boy whats wrong
Boy whats wrong
Wonder why this nigga don't sleep no more
