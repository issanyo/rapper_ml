[Hook]

I gotta move, I must escape (you know what's up)
I cannot stay, too long in one place (you know what's up)
I'm on the move, I'm on the run (you know what's up)
I'm on the move, I'm on the run (you know what's up)

I gotta move, I must escape (you know what's up)
I cannot stay, too long in one place (you know what's up)
I'm on the move, I'm on the run (you know what's up)
I'm on the move, I'm on the run (you know what's up)

[Verse 1]

Oh, damn, look at your man's
Oh, damn, what in your hands?
Oh, really girl I'm just a fan
Oh, really I come from the stands
Life has dealt me out some blows
I took it right on the chin
I had to flake on some friends
I hope I'm making amends
I need to make a decision
Spitting so surgical, make an incision
I got the vision, I'm on a mission
I used to feel like my mom was in prison
Now I'm just shining my light through the prism
Know what it is and I know what it isn't
I used to feel like this shit was a given
Straight from the ashes Young Wizzle has risen
I hope I'm making a difference
Take this for instance
Fucking the world like I'm making an infant
Take this for instance (Oh)
Rolling my muh' fucking dope when I'm making an entrance
Take this for instance (Oh)
I just be taking my time but I make it look instant
Take this for instance (Oh)
Take this for instance (Oh)
