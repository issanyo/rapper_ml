You don’t know me bruh (x8)

Chitown, my town alright all ‘round they show me love
I came, come down, I smoke an ounce of OG bud
Nigga that ‘ont mean nothing, (x4)
I see the haze, I feel the love
I see yo’ face, I feel the drugs
They tryna stop me, tryna lock me
Tryna box me, low inside
Like I just slow it down
Everybody say

Lord, Eighth and no 'Woods
Stay eating good
’Til the lord comes
Calling for me
Minding my own
Finding my throne
’Til the lord comes
Guarding for me
I think that we might just run away
It might be better if we just run away

[Bridge eight bars]

You don’t know me bruh (x8)

Pray the lord !
Pray the lord !
I’m him
I’m yours
Pray the lord !
Pray the lord !
Set the course
All aboard

Eighth and no 'Woods
Stay eating good
’Til the lord comes
Calling for me
Minding my own
Finding my throne
’Til the lord comes
Guarding for me
I think that we might just run away
It might be better if we just run away
