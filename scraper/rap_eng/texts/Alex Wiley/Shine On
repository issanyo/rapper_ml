[Verse 1: TIMO]
Too much money on these drinks and too much time away from home
All those days that i spent slaving just to get out all these songs
All those calls i might've missed and all those friends who left still gone
Tryna fit inside of lanes, but I'm just tryna make my own

She called me hollywood, she called me hollywood
Moved to a mountaintop close to the stars that overlooks west hollywood
I gotta say life nowadays ain't getting much better
More focus, more sweat and more work i know better
Than to give up on a dream before you get it
Cause you never know what happens and i promise if you fall that ima catch ya

[Hook 1: TIMO]
Where theres stars in the sidewalk
Where theres signs in the hills
Where they live in the valleys
Where the time stands still
Where you dream in the daytime
Where your nights never end
Where they tell you they love you
Where your story begins
They say, Shine on Shine on, ain't a thing they can take from you
They say, Shine on Shine on, ain't a thing they can take from you

[Verse 2: TIMO]
Little college dropout, tryna get his thoughts out
How you stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
I don't know guess i gotta kick the thots out
And you know how it goes, i could go toe to toe if you really want a knock out
I could bring the block out, blink and you dropped bring the chalk out
Bet he bout to pop better watch out, hope I'm on your watch now
Where you wanna go, take you where the streets filled with gold
Take you to the hills, shoot a film, even though she actin crazy boy you know the hoe gon' play her role
Cause I've been in the dirt, you've been pushing daisies
Putting in work, you've been getting lazy
And I've been hearing things lately
People talk about a place where you can't make it happen but you gotta think about it don't it sound crazy?

[Hook 2: TIMO]
Where theres stars in the sidewalk
Where theres signs in the hills
Where they live in the valleys
Where the time stands still
Where you dream in the daytime
Where your nights never end
Where they tell you they love you
Where your story begins
They say, Shine on Shine on, ain't a thing they can take from you
They say, Shine on Shine on, ain't a thing they can take from you

[Verse 3: Alex Wiley]
Impatient facing eighths I'm rolling 'j' up number two
Tried for years and cried them tears, still can't see my view
All these hoes around me tryna steal my soul
All these hoes around me tryna steal my soul

Hot little biddie gon' say how I'm zoning
Can't lie I've been feeling pretty hot this morning
Im finna do what i decide this moment
Cause i can't be walking round like i done folded
I've been scolded, N****s love to ridicule
N**** I ain't finish school, "Op-N****s" finna fool
Im finn a get it now, F*** what you finn a do
Y'all still don't get it how much N****s finna prove

[Hook 3: TIMO]
Where theres stars in the sidewalk

Where they live in the valleys
Where the time stands still

Where your nights never end
Where they tell you they love you

They say, Shine on Shine on, ain't a thing they can take from you
