[Intro]
Kicked my shoes off
Got comfortable
Got the whole studio smelling like feet
Lets get it!

[Chorus]
Searching high and low
Trying to find the keys to the door
Still chillin' hard, got no seeds in my smoke
Answering the phone like who the fuck is this?
Answering the phone like who the fuck is this?
X2
Searching high and low...

[Verse 1]
Ran up in your crib like its Seal Team 6
Had to tell yo main bitch I like my grilled cheese crispy
Thought Id bring the change but Im still to niche
I would leave this world forever but its still too risky
Every bitch with me tryna toke
But if every bitch with me think she smoking for free then
Every bitch thats with me gotta go
Cuz if you can't match my swag you ain't smokin with me bitch
Niggas tryna squad with me dawg
This is not a robbery dawg
I do not abide by these laws
[?]
Every single time we been called
I was named by a pussy nigga

[Chorus]
