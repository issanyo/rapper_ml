[Hook:]
We don't play no games
We don't say no names
She just want that thing
And I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
She just want that thing
And I'm on my way
I'm on my way

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Work for your dreams
Never pay for them
Fuck the new team
Never play for them
Waste away for them
Even when I'm working, I'm vacationing
I know it's mine and if it ain't in them
It doesn't matter where they station him
Young Wizzle will be making it
My biggest flaw is my abrasiveness
The basement is where my patience is
I face Swisher's and I lace 'em shit
Pace it

[Bridge]
Pacing it back and forth
Rolling up all my dope
These niggas they don't know
Rolling up all my dope
You know that I'm gone hold it down
You know that I'm gone hold it down

[Hook]
We don't play no games
We don't say no names
She just want that thing
And I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
She just want that thing
And I'm on my way
I'm on my way
