[Intro]
Yeah nigga, what?
This gonna make me pop that motherfucking trunk
Uh, Yeah nigga, what?
This gonna make me pop that motherfucking trunk

[Verse]
All my life I just been rolling wit it, been rolling wit it
Feel like we been in the zone wit it, been holding it down
We don't even play the same games that they play
All my life, don't be uncomfortable on my account
All my life I'm off the deep end, I'm tweaking
I think I'm seizin' had to lose it, left me woozy
All my life, your shit displeasing for no reason
You a mama, you a mama, you a goofy
All I mean, ultimately, to say is
I'm your, Young Stunna, duplexing condiments
Rapping my generation is impatient for the following

[Outro]
