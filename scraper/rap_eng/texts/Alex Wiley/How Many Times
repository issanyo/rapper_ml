How many times, how many times, how many times?
How many times, how many times, how many times?
How many times, how many times, how many times?

[Verse 1 Alex Wiley]
Never can't sleep on the boy
Never count out the kid
Said exactly what I did, living how I live
I been taking risk for my benefits
Never been a bitch
Okay maybe once or twice
I been livin on a high, levellin my mind, devil in disguise, took my own advice
And I took my time
Say what you want it don't matter to me
Can't always play in the minor leagues
Ok I'm done with the minor leagues
They lookin at me like finally
Running my dope where you finding me
Can't be broke ain't got no time to be
Let go of my past it was haunting me
Looked down at my plate, I'm willing to play, I don't wanna play, get out of my way
You wanted a gun, and went with the sun, that shit got me scared, I cannot wait
Who give a fuck if they feel you
They tryna play you a failure
You cannot buy what they sell you
How many times do I got to tell you?

[Hook Alex Wiley]
How many times how many times how many times
How many times how many times how many times
How many times how many times how many times
How many times how many times how many times

[Verse 2 Alex Wiley]
See the dark through my mind's eye
They can see the light blind guys
Hula-hoopin through the zeitgeist
757 time flies
Summer coolin sippin maitais
Yeah just what they tell him my turn
Yeah just what they tell me tell em for real
Yeah this ? got my mind right
And then it's all that fine line
Between love and hate there's a fine line
I just came out for a fine time
You the smiles in my mind, my
Damn shorty you define fine
I think your pussy got nine lives
So I'm tryna hit it like nine terms
I'm tryna hit it like nine times

[Bridge Alex Wiley]
I could give a fuck bout what you thought that it was
I could give a fuck bout what you thought that it was
It don't matter if you fell as long as you keep tryin
Pick yourself back up it don't matter how many times

[Hook Alex Wiley]
How many times, how many times, how many times?
How many times, how many times, how many times?
How many times, how many times, how many times?
How many times, how many times, how many times?

[Verse 3 Mick Jenkins]
How many times I gotta tell niggas that you're no friend of mine?
I don't see none of y'all I swear I just see finish lines
How many times you rode away, don't tell a lie, you can't be working my shit is urgent it's overtime
We goin down
Pray for the double up
Do we clean it or bubble up?
I got like 20k tucked away next to the adderall for when the trouble comes
Get yo money up, keep it bubblin
Middle finger to the government put all my niggas on 'cause it's humbling
I don't say everything, it'd be troublin
Lookin around I see all you clowns, still no one jugglin
The blessing's keep coming in these blessings
You can't stop what's meant to be, stop my energy
I been preachin this shit religiously check your memory bitch

[Hook Alex Wiley]
How many times, how many times, how many times?
How many times, how many times, how many times?
How many times, how many times, how many times?
How many times, how many times, how many times?
