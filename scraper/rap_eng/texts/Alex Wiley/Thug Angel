(Verse 1)
Chasin fame, chasin money
Got a lil name niggas tryna take it from me
Shit is gettin to me I can't even stunt
Swinging for the fences niggas tryna make me bunt
My innocence and my youth
Just disappeared in this booth
Poof
Ridin round in that coupe tryna keep my pockets on Bruce Bruce
You don't like how I do? Tru
Peace out my nigga, deuce deuce
Honeys go cause my money swole
I'm eatin honey combs and cous cous
You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck neither
Ridin round Cashin Out smokin on Keisha
Hey nice to meet ya no way that I need ya
No Waiving the fees I get paid for the features
Shut the fuck up Lil nigga
You don't really want it wit these Ville niggas, Nigga
We don't give a fuck bout nothin
Them lame ass niggas tryna push my buttons but FUCK IT
Rollin up, we gon get high tonight
She said "You gon be so damn famous"
Shit, you probably right
Couple bitches wit me, they look like the molly type
All a real Ville nigga need is the money and the chain
Wit the top down screamin out money ain't a thang

(Hook)
Naaaaaa naaaaaa
Naaa naaa naa
Naaaaaa naaaaaa
Naaa naaa naa
Chillin wit The Village, if u see a nigga holler
Tryna cop some Mo Purp
Lemme hold a dollar X2

Club "Wiley" X8

(Verse 2)
Titties in my phone
From a bitch that is not my bitch
Hey bitch, come tickle my privates
Living life like it's YOLO on my eyelids
Then it's bye-bye bitch
Back to the trap I go
Niggas real cold at the rap, I know
Pimp suit and a cane, if she lacks my dough
Baby powder in my hand I'mma smack my hoes

(Hook)
Naaaaaa naaaaaa
Naaa naaa naa
Naaaaaa naaaaaa
Naaa naaa naa
Chillin wit The Village if u see a nigga holler
Tryna cop some Mo Purp
Lemme get a dollar X2
