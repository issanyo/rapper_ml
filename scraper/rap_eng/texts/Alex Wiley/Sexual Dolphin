[Intro]
Um yeah, aw aw yeah, aw yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, aw yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, aw yeah

[Verse 1]
Hol, hold it, picture me rolling
You gon bossing but them bitches was stalling
Niggas had dreams but them bitches was stolen
I keep my shit peeled so dont question my motives
But, look at these niggas just posing
They livin timid I get away bolder
I am the boulder
All of that weight put it right on my shoulder
I can control it
Yeah
No longer the loser in case you ain't notice
But I swear to god its the same dude inside of me brother in case you ain't know this
Ay, shit ain't really made sense to me yet
Daily battle not to mentally spazz
Got too many fake friends to be sad
I just put the little pen to me pad that eventually says:
Ay, baby tell me whats good
Trynna leave this whole world behind
And you can come find ya boy in the woods now
I can not put the kush down
Baby tell me whats good now
Leave this whole world behind and you can come find ya boy in the woods now

[Hook]
We’re all insighting the change
No use in fighting the wave
I'm delighted to say
You're all invited to stay
We’re all enlightened today
Ay ay (x2)

[Verse 2]
Checked out
Straight from the bottom of the basement
I didn't lie to vindication
They told me that i need lots of medication
But I think he zoned out to my deficit
This guy giving me lots of meditation
So why don't you come take a ride to better places
I'm trying to open your eyes into the Matrix I'm flying through
The sight from which I see it
We were meant to be in
A muthafuckin museum
Sippin Chai Tea and Tai Chi and muthafucka you see 'em
WACHAAW!

[Hook]
