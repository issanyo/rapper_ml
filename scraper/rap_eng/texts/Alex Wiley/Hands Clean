Ooh I bet they can't stand me
Ooh I bet they can't stand me

[Chorus]
Thought I was a germaphobe the way I keep my hands clean
Thought I was a germaphobe the way I keep the bands clean
Never gave a fuck I know these people can't stand me
I think every living human being in my family

[Post-Chorus]
You're a showstopper
You're a showstopper
Rollin up my dope I got the whole world in my bong
You're a showstopper
You're a showstopper
Everything around me burnin
Somehow I can cope

[Verse 1]
Wadin in the water I was swimmin through my dreams
I was waiting in the wings
I was waiting in the scene
Took a trip across the border now I'm harder to be seen
And they hard to intervene
Come and barter with the G
Hardened up his heart cause they discarded ?
Made a martyr that's impartial to the particles of peace
And part of it is honest in his articles of speech
View the mansions and the porsches as a fortress o the weak
I'm sayin what they see
I'm sayin how it go
I'm rollin up my dough
I never been a ho
I'm pullin up, I'm pullin up
I'm pullin up on 10
I told your ass before and Imma tell your ass again


Thought I was a germaphobe the way I keep my hands clean
Thought I was a germaphobe the way I keep the bands clean
Never gave a fuck I know these people can't stand me
I think every living human being in my family

You're a showstopper
You're a showstopper
Rollin up my dope I got the whole world in my bong
You're a showstopper
You're a showstopper
Everything around me burnin
Somehow I can cope

[Verse 2]
She said, "I like your music"
I don't normally do this
But I think we should do this
I'm no newbie choosin'
Oh yeah I'm like a 4-disc
And I be meditatin
And I keep to myself lately
Please hold the other halo

When she rollin up the spliff she got the whole world in her bong
(Whole world in her bong, whole world in her bong)
When feelin on my dick she got the whole world in her bong
(Whole world in her bong, oh)

Wadin in the water I was swimmin through my dreams

[Chorus]

Rollin up my dope I got the whole world in my bong
Everything around me burnin somehow I can cope
