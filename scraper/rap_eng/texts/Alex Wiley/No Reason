[Intro]
I really don't need a reason
I really don't need a reason
I really don't need a reason
I really don't, I really don't
I really don't need a reason
I really don't need a reason
I really don't need a reason
I really don't

[Verse 1]
I been battlin my demons
Handling defeat like I'm a orthopedist
Caught a case and then I beat it
Took a ride and it was scenic
Boy you shoulda seen it
They ain't seein what I'm seein
They look to me for the meanin
I can see in they demeanor they mean to demean us
I just roll my weed up
Kickin back I got my feet up
Never fuckin up the re-up
Me and all my homies we up
Contemplating on some things
Living in a dream
All I do is be motherfucking seen
Living like a king
I been on my own I don't need anything
Nothing but the rings

You cannot stop where we strolling
You cannot stop where we stroll-ing
I know my soul is golden
But sometimes my soul get frozen

You cannot stop where we strolling
You cannot stop where we stroll-ing
I know my soul is golden
