[Intro: Alex Wiley]
Cough
At first I was fake coughing so you knew I was smoking
Now I'm real coughing
Cough
Alright check it

[Verse]
Getting to the cash though, never been too bashful
Spit it like I'm sipping Tobasco out the flask though
Stay fresher than a tadpole, so tell me what you mad for
Never been an asshole, okay I lied
Whipping, whipping, whipping in the fast lane, nothing's meant to last mane
Team on my back like it's my last name
Burden me, hurting me, I am hurdling the past mane
God built me sturdily, I ain't worried about the wrath mane
Never been fazed
I'm astounded at the foot of this mountain, ready to climb, say my grace
Took a seat at the table, ready to dine, ready to find
I bit off too much, overwhelming mouthfuls
Meditate in front of fountains when in need of council
Wonder what I'll amount to, they think they fucking with me
Highly doubtful
Wonder what Wiley 'bout to
Do to these guys
I don't do the disguises, I will out you
I am the son, you are new to the skies but I will melt you
Matter of fact let me help you
Matter of fact I don't need to
I would only mislead you
Matter of fact take this needle
Matter of fact free your mind and speak your truth and free your people
I just hope they believe you
I just hope they believe you
Matter of fact free your mind and speak your truth and free your people
I just hope they believe you
I just hope they believe you

[Outro: Sample]
Sister's and brother's, the first thing I wanna say is that I love you, and the second thing I want to say is that we can win. And in order to win our liberation we have got to be competent. We have got to believe that we will win

Power to the people!
