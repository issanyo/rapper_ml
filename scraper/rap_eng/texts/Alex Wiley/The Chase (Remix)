[Verse 1: Kings Dead]
I know I'll never bow down to the money or the fame
I just paint the real picture, put my life in a frame
Ain't seeing no diplomas on this side
Couple young kings in my city don't change
I gotta hand it to the haters, had a good thing going
In my ear talking all that bull
Write a book about proving all the critics you the one
My face on the cover like; I don't know you
All the way from somewhere in the sky
Where ambition is alive like me, (yeah)
All the way from suicide city
Where the kids with a dream run free
All the way from the backdoor
Never see the front, we don't need I.D
Everyday is hallelujah, tryna' save the place when I R.I.P

[Bridge: Kings Dead]
I was young and I was stupid
Yeah you know just how that goes
All the bumps along the way just make you stronger down the road
We grew up in Massachusetts
Had a hustle on the low
All these kids that went to Harvard actin' stupid at the show

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Oh, we had to dine
The [?] better be fine
And now they all around
And dispense and you finna' be down
But, I ain't own that
Taking your bitch, ain't no giving those back
Niggas talk shit, but they ain't living those rats
Then a nigga made a fence and I ain't giving no slack
Hold up and slate it
You must be crazy
We laughed so damn hard, when you said "save me"
Chasing comets, I'm racing drama
Nigga that shit don't phase me
What have you done for me lately

[Outro]
I skipped my last class
Took some cash and bought a ticket
Left a note for you to read
I hope you read it and weep
I'm chasing dreams ma, I'm chasing dreams everyday
I'm chasing dreams ma, I'm chasing dreams everyday
