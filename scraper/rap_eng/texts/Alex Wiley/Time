[Verse 1 - Alex Wiley]
I look around and all I see is plastic
Time for something drastic (today I got time)
Somebody needs their ass kicked
All of these people are Fascist
Why would I want to pay taxes?
I'ma keep that in the mattress (today I got time)
I'ma keep stackin'
But if I do they gon' knock on my door and
Throw me in them latches
I'ma just spaz then
I'ma go get me some cash then
My shit's so cold it's an Aspen
Get the J off like Sabastian
Young Wizzle I am established
I don't know why they be average
The trials in my past I am past them
I put they ass in the past tense

Hey, this world around me like a
Backwood burning slow
This world around me like a
Backwood burning slow (burning slow)
My mind is racing backwards
While I'm in my zone
This world is like a backwood burning
Burning slow

[Hook - Alex Wiley]
Rollin' up, I'm rollin' up, I'm rollin' up, I'm rollin' up
Today I got time

...Rollin' up, I'm rollin' up, I'm rollin' up, I'm rollin' up
Today I got time
I'm...
...Rollin' up, I'm rollin' up, I'm rollin' up, I'm rollin' up
Today I got time
I'm...
...Rollin' up, I'm rollin' up, I'm rollin' up, I'm rollin' up
Today I got time
I'm...
