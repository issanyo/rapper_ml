[Verse 1]

This weed is too wild
I done put up in the nile rider
Be god damned if i am not aware
Been feelin' like im sire
I'm ballin' and my buyer
I'm ballin' up your entire year
I'm not sold
That all these things I want will make me complete
My nights roam
I might wake up and wander 'round the country
Side
Penetrating the dome
And embracing the zone
Niggas love to be late
Niggas hate to be wrong
Guess thats just how it goes
I guess im just supposed to fold
Not me my nigga no, Wiley got 'em exposed
I be off in the corner
I don't like labels, I don't like when people call me a loner
I don't like labels, I don't like when they be callin my phone uh
Weed they be smoking
Weed they be rapping
Weed they be boostin'
But we got the vision
We got ambition
We'll show you both em

[Hook]

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're forgiven, for your insolence
Oh aw eh aw eh ahh
Aw aw aw, ah ah
You're forgiven for you're insolence

[Bridge]

Look now, tell me how it look now
Cause we headed from the ground but i will not look down
Tell me baby
Look now, tell me how it look now
Cause we headed from the ground but i will not look down

[Verse 2]

And I bet them niggas from 'round the way
Wonder why I don't fuck wit dem
You know why i don't fuck wit dem?
Don't get high or get drunk wit dem?
Cause when wiley was startin off man them niggas didn't fuck wit him
I'm just stackin' my ducats then
By my lonesome like fuck it then
Nigga uh

[Hook]

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're forgiven, for your insolence
Oh aw eh aw eh ahh
Aw aw aw, ah ah
You're forgiven for you're insolence

[Outro]

I'm just wonderin if it's all good
Like it's all good now, it's all good(x4)
