[Verse 1: Trapo]
Back on my side now
And I need to lie down
Tonight's been a rough night
And I had a rough time
I'm working on my sound
It doesn't sound right
Get lost in a loud cloud
Re-up when the sun rise
And I wanna wake up right right
In a Maybach with the weed lit or something
And I don't ever waste my time
We get higher, to a place that
Cut the feedback and assumptions, I don't need that
Right right
Ooh, this lil nigga is cool and beneficial
We choose to blow the whistle
When he see us telling his value, boo
And they gon' listen, I choose to stall
If I lose how I lose if I chose to fall
I don't need no boosts, nigga I see through 'em
They numbers are congruent, niggas out here playin' student
While I play the master
Don't hold the door, I let it close on who you think is after
Me, right

[Hook: Trapo]
Nigga what you waitin' for?
It's always time to go so I'm always on the road
What them niggas being patient for?
Don't act like I don't know why you asked me what to do
You just wish them people played you more
Like nigga what you waiting for?
Like nigga what you waiting for?
It's always time to go so I'm always on the road

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Did it the harder way
I got a part to play
I got some cards to play
Crossed over, no Hardaway
Crossed borders and chartered planes
Look at this artist taste
Extendo blunt, it was hard to face, ayy, ayy
It is not hard to change, ayy, ayy
Seen it from far away
I move at my pace
Life is not a race
If you standing right here
Who's guarding the safe?

[Bridge: Alex Wiley]
See colors when I blink
See colors when I blink
See colors when I blink
See colors when I- see colors, see colors

[Hook: Trapo]
Nigga what you waitin' for?
It's always time to go so I'm always on the road
What them niggas being patient for?
Don't act like I don't know why you asked me what to do
You just wish them people played you more
Like nigga what you waiting for?
Like nigga what you waiting for?
It's always time to go so I'm always on the road
