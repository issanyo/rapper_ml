[Hook: Jean Deaux]
Tired of fuckin' around
They know its nothing to me
Niggas is going insane
Cause they know they ain't fuckin' wit me

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Big gats in the back of the ride
Big stacks finna rap cause I'm high
Niggas know that they fooped in the back of they mind
Cause its time right now I'mma capitalize
These old niggas mad huh?
You still ain't know you jagged huh?
Mad cause I'm swagged up
Used to talk down til they got passed up
Muhfucka who hot as me?
Prodical prodigy, bitch ain't no stoppin' me
Put words together like fuckin' apostrophes
Musical odyssey, what is inside of me
Gotta get em out, gotta get em out
He don't like it? Nigga fuck dude, sit em down
Always talkin bout something he don't know shit about
Finna kill the game, niggas runnin round
Innit now
Ridin shotty, ridin shotty
It's a private party
Yo bitch is with me, finna ride the pony
Got the biggest tits, vibrate the phone
I hit the swisher I hit the bong
Talkin money, well get along
Get along
Classic records I'm sittin on
I blow they minds then send em home

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Monster Mike]
I can't stunt I'mma sad dude
If someone took your favorite shit from you, you'd be sad too
Its crazy I been fuckin' with this shit for the past 5
But I ain't tryna die and shit, I'm not about that life
At least I got rap right? Ain't never been just Mike
Cause when I rhyme the words on these lil beats it be just right
I'm finna save the world but if I can't then the hoods fine
And niggas hate on me cause they don't know what they look like
If you don't really care you gotta fuck wit me
Cause we got that in common, that won't change til I'm in coffin
Even then it probably wouldn't, other stuff does
Ion know, if you like I rap good
Then you will probably catch this reference
I been flexin' on my good and shit
Monster Mike the optimist, dipped got on that Harden shit
Still ain't saved a bitch, since I found out how that shit always ends
Plus ya mans needs all his ends so if you see me with a broad
I promise I'm not with the broad, I swear she could do all my friends
Some of 'em did some of 'em, a few of 'em did all of them
If you took offense well my bad bitch, I just be talking shit
That's when they get to stuntin', but its nothing
Well its something, cause its funny, I be chuckling
Looking at them like the Rock and shit
But fuck them baby, they ain't got it like this
Let me see your phone, I'm tryna lock me in
You supa raw, I'm eating and
I'm probably dude you leaving with
I'm kinda cool, but I'm real real hot
Fuck wit me now, cause on the real I'll be gone
Still stealing bics, then slam the bitch
Then pass the bitch, cause my name is Ahmad
You know my hands be active and I'm beatin that shit in every since
I tweaked on my lil fingers cause they asking and I feel that shit
I think there's different kinds of pain
Just like there's different kinds of stains
Just like there's different kinds of gangs
But my shit I put on my face
I'm bout that life, niggas hate
But them niggas crazy, they don't rap like Mike
I wonder how cold I'm finna end up since I write all the time
I wonder if my crib's on Clark & Lake, since I got all the lines
I wonder if I'll ever have a kid, yo bitch ate all of mine!

[Hook 2: Monster Mike & Alex Wiley]
That's what I like to get into
Hittin' stains, finna make us hit you
We don't give a fuck bout shit dude
Came outta that E-Class
My shit ain't no rental
That's that whip that I get into
Can't drive, I hope I don't hit you
Still don't give no fuck bout shit dude
Came outta that G5
My shit ain't no rental
