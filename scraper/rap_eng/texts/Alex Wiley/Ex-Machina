[Hook]
Young nigga stay up
Chilling in my lair
Dunking on my fears
Thank the man upstairs
Oh wow, imma have to pull up with the pump
Imma pull up on your block and tell you this ain't what you want (woo!)
Young nigga stay up
Chilling in my lair
Dunking all my fears
Thank the man upstairs
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
I'm at one with it all
I'm at one with it all
Never settle for [?] never come when they call
Be one with your god
Homie don't fuck wit'
Don't be on fuck shit
Fuck the republic
Don't let the gov'ment & the DEA
And they clutch all your substance
See my CD playing tell me you loved it
Which one was your jam?
New York with the fam, stuffing the grams, bumping the Cam
All over the globe, but what do you know, this nigga is gone
What were the odds
Keep playing your cards
How come every time I'm in the kitchen you be in the kitchen?
Free to my addiction
I don't need no intervention
I be on a mission
I be in them Pippens
I be booty grippin'
Perfect world, boys are prolly never trippin'
That's not why we live, it is what it is
I know what I want, you get what you give
I'm blowing a piff, I'm pouring a fifth
Let's roll to the crib
You know what it is
You know what it is
I was [?] and my spirit a-rise
Illustrated through the pen, upon which our love just appears

[Hook]

[Outro]
The way we, go
Away we, flow
