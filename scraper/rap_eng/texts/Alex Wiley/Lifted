The clouds around my shoulder I feel fine
The clouds around my shoulder I feel fine
The clouds around my shoulder I feel fine

It's like they all waiting on some

They was trying to rush I take my time

[Chorus]
Oh I'm lifted
I'm lifted lifted lifted lifted
Lifted lifted lifted lifted
Lifted lifted lifted lifted
