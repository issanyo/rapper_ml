[Verse 1 Keenan Coke]
I'mma let you rappers know that your style ain't ready
Yes I keep it gangster call me Joe Coke-Pesci
Home alone with your girl, palms all sweaty
Slapping on her ass til her cheeks start redding
Yes I got soul like Otis Redding
Never try to hate if you're not war ready
Any type of level that you feel like stepping
Might as well be the one off that jetty
Bursting for attention like New Orleans levy
Coming from a city where they rob for pennies
Or pounds, stop acting like the prince [?]
Now let me call your mama tell the bitch come get me

[Hook Kembe X (Alex Wiley)]
(YOLO, YOLO)
1, 2, 3, 4
Those are hella numbers (YOLO, YOLOOOOO)
Lay the dick upon her
Then I'm finna thumb her (YOLO, YOLO)
Bet a nigga 3 bucks
Can't nobody see us (YOLO, YOLOOOOO)
I gave your mom the pe-nus
That pussy gets a B+

(YOLO, YOLO)
Told the bitch to make it clap, shorty made it thunder (YOLO, YOLOOOOO)
Swaggin, flabbergasted, peep the titties on her Tumblr (YOLO, YOLO)
Talkin shit get beat up
30s on the Prius
It's The V and Kee-nun
Send it up then we done

[Verse 2 Alex Wiley]

YOLO
YOLO
YOLO
YOLO

All I know is YOLO
All I fuck is yo hoes
Ridin' round with like 4 hoes, and them hoes ain't got on no clothes
Fuck a Twinkie! Ho-ho's...
I'm Solo, Dolo
In a 4 Door
Taking photos
Of yo hoes
Plenty hate on The Village
28's on the Civic
Niggas hate how we livin'
Plenty plates, plenty shrimp
FUBU jump suit, with the FILA's to match 'em
Run up in your crib, find your CD's, and scratch 'em
Burning all your CD stores
Hiding all your TV cords
See these whores?
Fuck 'em with my wee-wee sword
Fuck 'em til my wee-wee sore
Nut bust then they see the door
Ripping shit when we get bored
Go for the Gusto, CB4

YOLO NIGGA

[Hook]

[Verse 3 Kembe X]

YEAH
YEAH
YEAH
YEAH

Navigator truck
Never gave a fuck
Smack a snitch then splack his bitch up in the elevator duct
Smashed a plate of swagger, then I got into some ignorant poppycock
Your pops may not accept me, cause I gave all of his bitches a sloppy fuck
"Gots to be the shoes" said the goofy on the premises
Business getting do'ed all thanks to my big homie Genesis
A nigga spits that Anthrax
Lace a zip with Xanax
A bitch question my plan? Well then that bitch gon meet my hand back
Chilling getting Superdome
Crackin party? We be there
These niggas eat the 3D Square
But I just put my wee-wee there
List of hella niggas doing YOLO shit, you'll see me there
It's 56 on 1 cause nigga I'll be damned if we be fair

[Hook] (One more time for the bitches)
