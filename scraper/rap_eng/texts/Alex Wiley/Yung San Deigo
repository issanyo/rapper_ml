[Intro]
I'm like that Yung San Diego
Servin' all the yayo

[Verse]
15 cell phones swap them out on the daily
My Motorola doing summers off lately
I just copped a tiger, I just copped a jet plane
The mansion is new, my statue they're erecting
I just left Columbia, triple my nest egg
You got beef, it's destined, I'm plugged up, I'm tapped in
I was never alive back in the day [?]
Broke as shit, minimum wage, nigga hold up
Taking a change ready to face
Reminiscin' on the very first day I mixed the 'caine with the soda
