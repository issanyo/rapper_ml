Shorty what cha wanna leave, nigga, leave, you got to breathe, please, breathe
And I'm the man don't be deceived, nigga, ceived, you got to breathe, nigga, breathe

[Verse 1: Calez]
Hey
Forty days, forty nights
Couple bands and some flights
Young Mozart, she wanna take a picture imma pose with her
On a boat boy, know I might smoke with her
Young glow hitter, imma glow witcha
I won't loathe witcha, no no no sister
I got a lotta things on my mind
I'm moving 'round this bitch in perfect time
I love myself cause I'm the perfect kind
The water barer I'm the perfect sign
You catch the wave, and I flow the rhymes
Lebron James, I'm going overtime
My city love me and they know it's mine
Came out the dungeon flying on the spine
Of a dragon, what's happenin', what's happenin'?
You cappin we leave, we chilling like trees
My nigga just breathe

[Bridge: Calez]
Do do do do

(Hey you, hey, remember to)

[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
God is my witness
Everytime I ride I come with it
Living life I broaden my vision
Every night I caught an epiphany
I was rolling my dope and
Feeling like I seen what he sent for me
We was low in the soul but I know that we'll see it eventually
I got love for my enemies
Winnin', movin' pieces, movin', sink like the centipede
I've been living for centuries
Give a fuck if you mention me, aye
I'm just keeping shit interesting, aye
I don't play, but I'm in the game, what the fuck you mean
I don't sing, but I hit some notes, as I hit the weed
I don't scream, bitch I try to keep it G as I can be
I don't need shit, wake up every morning and just breathe, nigga, breathe

[Hook]
