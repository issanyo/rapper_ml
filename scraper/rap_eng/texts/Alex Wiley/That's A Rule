[Intro: CRSN & Tongel]
I'm popping Xans and Percocets
I sell them bands to your connect
I never fronted
That's a rule
Don't give a damn 'bout your perception
Oh no no no no no
(x2)
Catch me rolling up the doja
She pull up and drop it low (x2)

[Verse 1: Tongel]
I been dropping these bills
On strippers and drugs
I love how it feels
That's why I been popping these pills
My body is numb
Throwing these ones
Might just go cop me a crib
On top of the hills
Hoes in the tub
She tells me to hop in the whip
Her hand on my dick
She want me to fuck

[Bridge: CRSN]
I be nervous while I'm speeding past the cop's lights
Swerving in and out of lanes
Blowing every stoplight
Speeding up at stop signs
Decisions is not right
Calling up my lawyer like
These charges getting dropped right
No way
No way
Stopping and I never did change
They gave me the drop but I'm making it rain
They said that we could never make it
Tell 'em to stop cause I'm making a lane

[Hook]
I'm popping Xans and Percocets
I sell them bands to your connect
I never fronted
That's a rule
I never fronted
That's a rule
Oh no no no no
(x2)
Catch me rolling up the doja
She pull up and drop it low (x2)

[Verse 2: Tongel]
Catch me rolling up the doja
Like a pro yeah
That's the protocol
I'm like Prodigy's prodigy
Don't know nothing 'bout no co-dependence
And I'm cold cause I wrote with co defendants
Sin without no repentance
I grew up and I'm so relentless
Got some demons don't make me rebrand
On the news like CSPAN
Been known that God got me
In that godbody
Like Morgan Freeman
Let me watch you freefall
Ain't sick of the freeload
Oh you want some prerolled?
Just know that this shit not free fam (x3)

[Bridge]
Still got some homies selling soda
Paycheck coming from the block
And I still ain't met the quota
Goddamn I guess that's why

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Alex Wiley]
Okay I do my thing
He dropped out of school
To serve the weeds
They say he blew the joint
I do all the math inside my head
I do computer things
I cannot stop wilding
They do not know what to do with me
Came up from the bottom
I can't lie
This shit is new to me
What the fuck I'm finna do for me
Even knowing you would see
Always been a lunatic
All I know is lunacy
Everybody mad
They want control over the next man
I can't change what's true to you
All I know is true to me

[Outro: Alex Wiley]
I got gas on my mind
And my past way behind me
I'm rolling up a dime
And another dime
Everybody's gone
(x2)
