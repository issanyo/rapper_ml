[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Please don't get it misconstrued
I will never be that dude
I will never follow rules
Wait, who the fuck are you?
Niggas always losing focus
They will never follow through
If i always sugarcoat it
You would never know the truth
I forever show and prove
Aye, please don't get it twisted
I don't see these niggas
I don't need these niggas
They don't see these visions
I am rated x, ain't no PG picture
I am in the future
I am 3D printed
I am on a mission
I dont need permission

[Hook 2x: Alex Wiley]
Where the fuck were you when I was in the closet putting knives up on my left wrist?
Where the fuck were you when I was in the projects niggas tryna take my necklace?
Please don't fucking play me like my uncles wasn't dropping bodies in the gardens
Please don't fucking play me like I'm not the one
And like i do not go the hardest
Please dont fucking play
That's all i got to say

[Bridge: Alex Wiley]
Yes I'm in the game but I do not play
What the fuck you mean?
Yes I'm in the game but I do not play (3x)
What the fuck you mean?
Yes i'm in the game but I do not play (2x)

[Verse 2]
Lots of things have come
Lots of things have gone
We the latest ones turning tables that i place my plate upon
Ditching fables that they tried to raise a son (tried to raise a son)
I don't play the fool
I won't play the butt
I don't pay the school
Barely pay the park
I will raid the Ark
Running out of time
Running out of time
Don't believe in that
Pessimistic view, love conceded that
I can see the flaws
I can see the cracks
Running out of time
Running out of time
Know your enemy
Running out of time
World just let it be
Know your pedigree
