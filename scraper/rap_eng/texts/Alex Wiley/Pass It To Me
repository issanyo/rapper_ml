(Chorus)
Pass it to me
Pass it to me
You do not need it just pass it to me
Hotbox the whip and I cash on the seats
Flame up the dope and then pass it to me

(Verse 1: Alex Wiley)
I think most of it's about control
Every action has a price to pay
And every price to pay will therefore takes it's toll
I think I'd like to say that I was never folding
I am never going I am never tripping
I forever flip it I could never fold it
forever rip it they forever quote it
I am levitating my way up the totem
I just hop on shit and I get to floating
And the whip so wild the cops they thought I stole it
Ever since I moved to California hella snobby with the marijuana
Damn I'm sensing why this record sauna
they wouldn't have seen it if I hadn't of shown em
To the day they try to fuckin stone him
Aint nobody finna fuckin own him

(Chorus)
Pass it to me
Pass it to me
You do not need it just pass it to me
Hotbox the whip and I cash on the seats
Flame up the dope and then pass it to me

(Verse 2: Kembe X)
Pass it to me
Pass it to me
(?)
Wait (wait)
Take it from me
You got' get faded way faster than me (uh)
Patience disappearing gradually
Higher spirits been inhabiting me
Evolution coming naturally (coming naturally?)
What happened to me?
Focus fixed on the big picture
Sewing seeds on you nitpickers
I been blowing trees
When that burning bush get to talking to me I be so intrigued
Little nigga with a quick temper
Yea, mood swings had me throwing things
Don't confuse a want for a need
I have a hard time ignoring dreams
I might never ever go to sleep
Til' I see the vision while I'm wide awake
No hallucination know I'm off the (?)
You could die today
Staying on track, mind is train
Peddle pressed though its not a race
I am out of place anywhere
Til' you see me outer space could you pretty please...

(Chorus)
Pass it to me
Pass it to me
You do not need it just pass it to me
Hotbox the whip and I cash on the seats
Flame up the dope and then pass it to me

(Outro)
I do this all the time
She do this all the time
But I never so, she never been so
We never been so high
