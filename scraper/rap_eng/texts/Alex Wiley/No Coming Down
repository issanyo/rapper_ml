[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Rollin' up I got some dope on my mind
In the zone I do not know what I'll find
There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere to hide
Just roll up a Backwood and that will suffice
Came for some nights and I'm having a time
Came from the ashes and capitalize
Smoking as though I don't talk on the phone
Stick with the package and that was advised
Be watching your tone when you're talking in tongues
She off of the snow and I'm off of the 'dro
Even when paper was awfully low
I always knew I could do what I want
Law of attraction, It's always no accident
I'm on that acid, turn me to a pacifist
No one get past, and that shit is abundant
There's no need to ration it, yeah
I take that cup and I ash in it, yeah
My Momma and I put some cash in it, yeah
I am not waving or flashing it, yeah
I am not, (I am not I am not)
I think I'm stuck in a moment in time
I hope my place saver's holding the line
I know what I know I don't know if I lied
I know what I know I don't know if I died
 
[Hook: Sky Montique]
Sippin' on the side is where you'll find me (find me)
You can take a trip you know where I'll be (I'll be)
Just hop on a cloud it ain't too far
There's no coming down from where we are
Sippin' on the side is where you'll find me (find me)
You can take a trip you know where I'll be (I'll be)
Just hop on a cloud it ain't too far
There's no coming down from where we are
 
[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
I waited and waited and waited and now it's alive
I thought it would never arrive
Had to think twice to surmise
I thought about quitting I couldn't I didn't I do what I do to survive
I'm looking at you in your eyes
Keeping it true to the tribe
Wanna play bitch I'm ready and I'm willing
100k on my debit bitch I'm chilling
Living too fast I did it for the feeling
Get your goof ass away from me this minute
Oh no, goddamn
You do not want to go after this, yeah
Oh no, not again
I shoot the J and I'm splashing it, yeah
I take that cup and I ash in it, yeah
My Momma and I put some cash in it, yeah
I am not waving or flashing it, yeah
I am not, (I am not I am not)
I think I'm stuck in a moment in time
I hope my place saver's holding the line
I know what I know I don't know if I lied
I know what I know I don't know if I died
