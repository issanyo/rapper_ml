[Hook]
All my life has been been one big weekend
All my life has been, fuckin' tweakin'

[Verse 1]
Came down, all my niggas good
Not a single fuck to give, I wish a nigga would
Same night, crawlin' through the woods
People came from all around to watch a nigga do it
Now we know where I'm goin', get the fuck out my way nigga
Talking shit but don't know him, throwin' dirt on my name nigga
4 a.m. in the booth, just got paid [?] nigga
Mix the gin with the juice, threw the party over just came nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All this weed on me, all this weed on me bro
All this cream on me, major leaguely known
Calling me to all this scenery I could easily sow
Ya'll just need to be growns, I just need to be on
I just need to be on, on my own
I just need to be on, on my own
I just need to be on, on my own
I just need to be on, on my own

Villager Villager Villager Vill
House full of bitches and a mouth full of pills
Villager Villager Villager Vill
House full of bitches and a mouth full of pills
