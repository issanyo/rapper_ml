I'ts ya boy
Get my phone, Its ya boy
At my home, Its ya boy
Yes? hello, (Its ya boy)x2

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Its just a young free thinking nigga in a room full of older folks
Tell me when surrounded by pebbles you will never hear the boulder boast
But tell me when the rebels up rise, and the tyrant is overthrown
Can you say you were there, and that you were on the side of the old or was you on a side of ya own
But fuck it let's not waste time, I don't wanna waste time
Created in a wasteland, shouts out i made it out the wasteland
Go head inform the station, we got a situation
All that shit you play son, is what puts you to adjacent
I don't put no face on, i don't put no face on
Ain't never been no snitch son, ill take that to grave son
You want a demonstration, I think I can arrange that
Everything will change son and no you can not change that
(Don't think it won't)

[Hook]
Daa daa daa dadada, just don't cross that line
Daa daa daa dadada, I'll see it everytime

Never thought this money would be worth nothin, never thought id see the day
Never thought this money would be worth nothin, but imma get it either way

[Verse 2]
I don't belive in destiny, I hope the lords is testing me
My emotions get the best of me and I hope you see whats next to me
All the note's, those addressed to me
But my new love's obssesed with me, (she gone be the death of me)x2

(Check That List, Boy They See My Name
I don't think id ever be ashamed)x2

[Hook]
Daa daa daa dadada, just don't cross that line
Daa daa daa dadada, I'll see it everytime

Never thought this money would be worth nothin, never thought id see the day
Never thought this money would be worth nothin, but imma get it either way
