See that's the kind of girl, that I need

I need a girl that's educated
This for all the girls that graduated
This for all the girls that fucking made it
This for all the girls that I should be datin’
This for all the girls that be money makin’
Well alright
This for all the girls that be money makin’
Well alright

Cause I'm just so tired of the ones that ain’t shit
The one's that never ever been ambitious
The ones that always run they mouth
Yeah, that bitch
The ones that always run they mouth
Yeah, you bitch

I want a girl that can really blow my mind, mami
And an extraordinary one-of-a-kind, mami
Her body banging like a CL5 double 0
But that ain't all I know
I need a girl that's smart, one really intelligent
A girl with heart, somebody who don't take no shit
So, if you up then make yourself known, mami
Because I’m looking for somebody

I need a girl that's motivated
This for all the girls that be getting hated
This for all the girls that can even fade it
To all the pretty girls that God created
Cause those are the type that you know that I like
Who really down to earth and ain't uptight
Girls in the morning that look good as last night
Girls in the morning that look good as

[Verse 1: tabi Bonney]
Last night was alright
She told me “just live life”
Every night like prom night
She wore heels, I wore Nikes
In this world it's two types
Other girls and the prototype
And she knows just what I like
Know just what I like

I want a girl that can really blow my mind, mami
And an extraordinary one of a kind, mami
Her body banging like a CL5 double 0
But that ain't all I know
I need a girl that's smart, one really intelligent
A girl with heart, somebody who don't take no shit
So, if you up then let me know
So, if you up then let me know

I want a girl that can really blow my mind, mami
And an extraordinary one of a kind, mami
Her body banging like a CL5 double 0
But that ain't all I know
I need a girl that's smart, one really intelligent
A girl with heart, somebody who don't take no shit
So, if you up then make yourself known, mami
Because I’m looking for somebody

Who would ride for me, die for me
Grind for me, live for me
Go for me to the infamy
See, that's the kind of girl that I need
(Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na)
Because I’m looking for somebody
See, that's the kind of girl that I need
