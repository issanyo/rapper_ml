Feat. Tabi Bonney
I’m so in love with you
That’s what you told me, and when you hold me
I know you do
And I like the way you’re comfortable
You’re thoughtful, you’re strong for me
And that’s sweet oh, but I don’t know, yeah
Maybe I got a screw loose, but I won’t quit you baby
But I wanna hold hands with you, just want that, ah
Hey, never meant to be a heartbreaker
Never meant to be the one to break your heart
Nothing in the world …will do
That makes sweet love to you
But first we gotta break up
Boy, take a look at you
You’re so perfect, I know you’re worth it
I’m not for you
And though I love the way your body talks
Your fingers work, like my skin hurts
Still I gotta do what, what I gotta do, yeah
Maybe I got a screw loose, but I won’t quit you baby
But I wanna hold hands with you, just want that, ah
Hey, never meant to be a heartbreaker
Never meant to be the one to break your heart
Nothing in the world …will do
That makes sweet love to you
But first we gotta break up
Hey, never meant to be a heartbreaker
Never meant to be the one to break your heart
Nothing in the world …will do
That makes sweet love to you
But first we gotta break up
You’re the only one that I was trippin off
Game time, once it’s glued, and she kicked it off
Damn baby, just consider me a mixtape
No shelf life, but it felt like
And hell yeah I was thinking what we have was classic
On the inside, you was doing backflips
Where we go when the sex ain’t enough though
You texting me about 788 xos
Not bad I was counting
But after all that it …special
Now the room better, get low, coming with the 38 special
Now I’m gonna let go, blow
Hey, never meant to be a heartbreaker
Never meant to be the one to break your heart
Nothing in the world …will do
That makes sweet love to you
But first we gotta break up
Hey, never meant to be a heartbreaker
Never meant to be the one to break your heart
Nothing in the world …will do
That makes sweet love to you
But first we gotta break up
