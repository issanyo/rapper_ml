Top notch material, top notch material
Top notch material, material girls
G-g-g-girls, g-g-g-g-girls
Top notch material, top notch material
Top notch material, material girls
G-g-g-girls, g-g-g-g-girls
Top notch material, material girls

[Verse 1]
Her waist line, my bass line
This one going to take time
I will wait forever babe
Like a bowl-cut, you won't fade
I don't deal with no grenades
If you ain't know, I'm tabi Bonney
And and tabi Bonney is a saturday, saturday, saturday
On Monday's, we still play
She intrigued with that good life
That six city, tour life
Bang out, all night
We don't sleep, you're on overdrive
Just loosen up, and enjoy the ride
Pedestrians get pulverized
I suggest that ya'll just mobilize
Beau regard
If you whack, then it's au revoir
If you not, then voil√†, open sesame, this is destiny
Make moves effortlessly, in the presence of his excellency
And I like, I like, I like, I like

[Verse 2: tabi Bonney]
It's all about that provolone, still paying back them student loans
But we don't care, we over here. On the throne, where we belong
Welcome to the fashion show, you are now in my chateau
Beautiful girls on overload, scan that like a bar code
Whatever you want so non-chalant, guard that like avant
She all that, and then some. We kill for that where we from
Other than that, it's all love, that's parbey even unplugged
And you don't know what you do to me, definition of foolery
Straight jacket and all that, your welcome packet is on the map
I'm a member, if I remember --give it a sec. let it render
Her waist line, still on my mind. I think about her all the time
And I like, I likes, I like
