[Tabi Bonney]
Chalet, you ain't never going to find me in the party
Faking, like they balling like they Paul McCartney
But you can catch me around my neighborhood with paper goods
Swear it out the brother bands, you know I've got the upper hand
On Capitol Hill with gorgeous girls and daffodils
In the game like Ski Beatz, like UNC in Chapel Hill
You know I'm worldwide, a jet setter tour guide
