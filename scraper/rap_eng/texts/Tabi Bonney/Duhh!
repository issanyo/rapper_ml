[Verse 1: Tabi Bonney]
I saw a rapper that got robbed for his
Now that's what I call off the chain
My dream truck is the Range
I grew up looking up to *Jaley Dane*
Whose score off the drop my name
So imagine what I get cause I'm the mane
Fake killers got awful aim
Internet thugs talkin' 'bout, "do you do AIM?"
Tryna touch battle raps for change
Talkin' 'bout what your numbers, bro, it ain't a game
Dudes ask them girls what they drink
While Tabi askin' girls what they think
Tryna see what's up with they head
And if it's all butter then maybe we can break bread
Girlies be off they meds
Like a shape up, they got a awesome edge

[Scratched hook]
I'm like the best
DUHH!

[Verse 2: Tabi Bonney]
And I ain't the one to complain
I ain't a sport's fanatic, but what's up with the game?
The industry is so mundane
Everybody is a kin to me now I got fame
Tell me why they so fake
Like bags hold down Georgetown off the lake
Them Africans is coming up
I should know. I'm one of them. Wale, what up?
Gucci sneaks on my feet
*Bunay round waist hurt label feet*
Obviously I sleep around
I'mma stay a swinger 'til my feet hit the ground

[Hook]

[Samples]
We know you got soul, so you know you gotta lace it
*We know you wear your hair but* hit em hard with the Basics
We told them fluke dudes to get off that gay shit
Get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, back
Get off, my, my, my, my my back
