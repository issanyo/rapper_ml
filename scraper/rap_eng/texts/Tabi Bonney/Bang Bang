[Verse 1: Tabi Bonney]
You shoot ‘em on down like hurting boys is the thing to do
Such a beautiful killer, wonder who created you
I know you’re bad for me, papa warned me ‘bout girls like you
It’s true
Bang, she aim right at me wearing nothing but Vera Wang
She told me I was special then said all these other dudes the same
I never met a girl like you baby, what’s your name?
Oh man

[Hook: Tabi Bonney]
You shoot ‘em on down, shoot ‘em on down
Baby, you
Shoot ‘em on down like hurting boys is the thing to do
Shoot ‘em on down, shoot ‘em on down
Shoot ‘em on down, shoot ‘em on down, you
Shoot ‘em on down like hurting boys is the thing to do

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Shoot up the club
Know I keep that thing tucked just in case you ever want some
You can’t get enough
One shot now she telling me that she in love
Know I keep the AK, I’ma make you stay late
Know you hear your friends hate, you don’t care what they say
Automatic shots brrrr pop out bang bang
You could be the witness, ain’t no First 48
Ask you ‘fore I take a picture
Video up in my camera phone
Quentin Tarantino even though you got a man at home
Shoot the video, shoot your nigga if he get involved
I ain’t got no problems but the chopper got an attitude
Bitch you
Got a pretty face and you got a fat ass I could slide into
And me, I’m just tryna find an extra clip
That’s your best friend and you

[Hook: Tabi Bonney]
You shoot ‘em on down, shoot ‘em on down
Baby, you
Shoot ‘em on down like hurting boys is the thing to do
Shoot ‘em on down, shoot ‘em on down
Shoot ‘em on down, shoot ‘em on down, you
Shoot ‘em on down like hurting boys is the thing to do

[Interlude: Tabi Bonney]
Bang bang bang
She go bang bang bang

[Bridge: Tabi Bonney]
Shoot ‘em up, shoot ‘em up, oh
What a beautiful killer I know
Shoot ‘em up, shoot ‘em up, oh
What a beautiful killer I know
Shoot ‘em up, shoot ‘em up, oh
What a beautiful killer I know
Shoot ‘em up, shoot ‘em up, oh
