[Hook: Matt Beilis]
I'm chasing mine
See you when I get there
See you when I get there
Cause' I'm chasing mine
See me when I get there
See me when I get there

[Verse 1: tabi Bonney]
And I was trying to come up
Like it's the fourth quarter of the finals, and I'm one up
We going til sun up
Cause' now I'm like the brokest
The bill collectors saying that I owe this
My girls' arms are folded, telling me that I'm bogus
For the promises that's broken
Cause' I was supposed to blow up
Instead things imploded, man
The bottom so ferocious
I got to keep my focus
I can only take these loses in doses
And of course the haters know this
Hey, how you doing
I know you love to see my life in ruins
I ain't quit yet, I'm just refueling
I thought I was a shoe-in
I hope they still recruiting
I hope my icons don't think that I'm a nuisance
I'm an outsider whenever I'm around
My car broke down on the way up town
But I will never cave in
The game ain't over, I'm just trailing
I don't know about you, but I ain't faking

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And I'm not particular, I just want the money
I want the city that I'm from to say tab we miss ya'
And is it asking too much to be a A-lister
And could I get all that without being an ass kisser
And this is like a test, and I can only take a lesson [with?]
And I don't like the stresses, so I'm going to make the best of it
And when I get my shot, I hope that I don't make a mess of it
And when I make it, I'm going to show my ass for the 'F' of it
Here's to the underdog, defeated all the odds
Here's to the prince that's no longer a frog
Here's to the princess that's always working hard
It ain't going to be too long before I see you on top
The school loans are gone, your cellphone is back on
The people saying I believed in you all along
Hey, yeah we did it, now everybody and their baby mama wanna kick it
Hold up, let's pose for this picture

[Hook: Matt Beilis & tabi Bonney]
And I'm chasing mine (uh uh, uh uh)
See you when I get there (the realest, the realest)
See you when I get there (the realest, the realest)
Cause' I'm chasing mine (uh-uh, uh-uh)
See you when I get there (the realest, the realest)
See you when I get there (the realest)

I said baby, don't worry --I'm on it
I said mama don't worry, I'm on it
See that car right there, yeah, I own it
See that house right there, yeah, I own it
Said we own it, said we own it
