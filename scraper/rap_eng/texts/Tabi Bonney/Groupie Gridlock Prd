[verse: Tabi Bonney]
Crush, hit them with the [?] [?]
Both from Ski Beatz, look at how we ended up
We know, we know (we, we, we, we, we)
We know, we know, we know
The beast of this, promises [?]
This is how we rock, rock
Groupies got me gridlocked, we ain't going nowhere for a while, young get it
The crown belongs to those that don't [drown?]
Look me up and down, you in the presence of a king
It's enough to go around
In my slippers, in the west wing like I'm [Jack Tripper?]
Trippin' off the kicker, who mister [gang gold?]
But we still scoring over here, in this tin fold
Ohh --- we know, we know, we know (know, know, know, know)
We know, we know
Tell me if you know another cold mo' fo' coming off like this
My creative control is worth more than your life
Add a couple zeros, and it's still good night
Nice kicks on my feet at all times, let you know I ain't slipping in the streets
And if you sleeping on me, mother fucker --- goodnight
Tuck them in Tab, they going to need a night light
With some PJs and some warm milk cause they really ain't got no life
Here's to my superstar friends, here's to the winners --- here's to my Mercedes Benz
Rock (rock, rock, rock, rock)
Yeah, they see we jumping out the gym
Here's to the gorgeous girls in my Mercedes Benz
(rock, rock, rock, rock)
Here's to my superstar friends, here's to the winners --- here's to my Mercedes Benz

Tell me if you know another cold mo' fo' coming off like this (this, this)
Tell me if you know another cold mo' fo' coming off like this (this, this)
