I know that you love me but I love you more
She told me she love me but I love you more

[Verse 1: tabi Bonney]
And I just wanna own her first name
I knew that from the moment that she first came
Caught up in the moment, how time fly
She turn me down 8 and took me 9 tries
Contemplate life over milkshake and fries
When I’m with her, every day the fourth of July
The beautifulest thing that I ever knew
She late as usual, right on schedule
Ain’t seen her in a minute
Yesterday was too long ago, I mean minutes
She try to keep my head down on her until she feel it
Terrorist love menace, menace
I listen to the things that she going through
But simply ask her what she think she goin’ through
Then I let her know that I’m here for her
And whatever that she need, I support her

I know that you love me but I love you more
She told me she love me but I love you more

Ah yeah
Ah yeah
I love you more

[Verse 2: tabi Bonney]
She break up with me like once a month
Then text me the next day, I’m like “what you want?”
She apologize, of course I oblige
Cause' the day she leave me is the day I die
She my best friend, she my better half
It’s us against the world until this earth end
And I’m usually not really the jealous type
But I could kill a motherfucker tonight
Them numbers in her phone better not be wrong
Them better be her girlfriends on the other line
My heart beat double time, she better not be lying
I ask God just to please give me a sign
And there you were, gorgeous as ever
You told me you wouldn’t cheat on me, not ever
And I won’t either, so we are forever

I know that you love me but I love you more (I love you more, I love you more)
She told me she love me but I love you more (I love you more, I love you more)

Ah yeah
I love you more
I love you more
I love you more
Ah yeah
I love you more
Ah yeah yeah yeah
