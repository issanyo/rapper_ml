[Tabi Bonney]
And to the haters, hello (hello, hello, hello, hello)
And to the haters, hello (hello, hello, hello, hello)

And to the haters, hello (Oooo, all day long --- uh yeah, yeah)
Hello,  all night long


[Verse 1:  tabi Bonney]
Uh, you know we livin'
You know I ain't trippin'
You know I ain't ever have to cook up in no kitchen
Yet, I'm still the dopest out here
Whippin' what I'm whippin'
And my bank account says you can't tell me no different
And uh, you know I get it
I know we all got troubles
And I stepped in a couple of puddles in my kickers
Almost got booted when my car got a couple of tickets
Got turned down by the beautifulest bitches
These valleys make these peaks more sweet
Thank you lord for this humble pie, bon appetite
When I was dead broke, people took me for a joke
Bills piled the fuck up, I thought there was no more hope
People on the sidelines praying that I choke
But instead piggy banks and ankles out here, getting broke
Welcome to the life
Friends ain't friends anymore, but it's okay
I'm always going to be alright

[Hook]
'Aouu', all day long (uh yeah, yeah)
'Aouu', all night long (uh yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: tabi Bonney]
Let's forget about our worries, and them unpaid bills
Tonight we're going to party like it's twenty-twelve
With the beautifulest girl, I could conquer the world
And as soon as I find her, I'm going to make her do a twirl
[MJ?] spinnin', ain't no question we just livin'
VIP regardless of whatever section that I sit in
We we're always great, money made us better
But it never made us who I am, I'm just trying to tell ya'
I was never jealous of them over zealous fellas'
I'm going to get it on my own, I knew I was always stellar
Only the beginning of consecutively winning
Superstars now, we are no longer pretending
Remember when we used to fake front and pretender
But we are superstars now, we are no longer pretending
Waiting for this moment, so please give me a moment
Living in the moment, ain't no renting, young, we own it

[Hook]
