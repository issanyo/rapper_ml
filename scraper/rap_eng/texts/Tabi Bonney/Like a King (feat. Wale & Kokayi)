Hello, is that you bangin' at my door?
Askin', can Tab, your boy, Bonney, come out to play?
Okay, I guess we'll conquer the world today
Danke, please tell 'em that I'm on my way

Or maybe we could just go and chase after girls
After all I'm in no rush to save the world
People don't even appreciate us anyways
So the world can wait on us 'til another day

Ah, I wish I could just blow it off
It ain't that easy especially when you a know-it-all
It's just that easy for me to go and blow it all
And I already know they prayin' for my downfall

Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things
And how to live just like a king
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha, man
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha

Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things
And how to live just like a king
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha

And I, and I, and I, and I usually don't be showin' off
Showboatin' on these bamas as I'm sellin' off
Goal postin' on these youngins, yes, I do indulge
And occasionally I put my hands upon my balls
And, yes, I know, babe, I promised you that I would call

We pinky-sweared but my fiancée beat you there
I told her that she listenin' to too much Beyoncé
Put a ring on that microphone fiend on it
Just make sure you don't toss Billy Jean on it

And they, and they told me that the haters always come with it
I said, cool, babe, tell them Gumps, come, get it
I'm prepared, I eat vultures medium rare
And my mom said, Tab, you ain't fair

Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things
And how to live just like a king
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha, man
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha

Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things
And how to live just like a king
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha

Workin' like a peasant 'til I'm livin' like a king
I tell her, let me in the bed but you can't see me in the streets
Clever as a feather avoiding the wind
While you just livin' like it's not that important to win

Condescending is my tone, rent a Bentley so I roam
Just like I'm ballin' though I don't
I'm tryin' to live just like His Highness, sippin' on a Heiny
Ain't fuckin' with me lyrically go find you some vagina

A genius, a G in this
Although I'm never, ever praised on achievements
They hate to see me winnin', they been tryin' to close my window
But they fear me like king, I just made play for Sacramento

You couldn't be this fresh if you done ate a sack of Mentos
Wale been on his ten toes, roger that, ten-four

Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things
And how to live just like a king
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha, man
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha

Can't help you, baby, if you don't know 'bout finer things
And how to live just like a king
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha
'Cause you don't really know, hey, but we gotcha
