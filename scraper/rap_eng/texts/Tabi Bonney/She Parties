[Verse 1:  tabi Bonney]
Clear blue, skies out
Sun shade, reflect
I met her on sunset
Car horns blow like trumpets
Her man is a reject
Told her, she don't need that
She hopped in my car
And told her boyfriend, we'll be be back
Her lip gloss: glossy
Body: Gaddafi, crazy
Cause once she turned around, caught me
Girls just wanna have fun
I say yeah I know the song
And if you could sing it to me, then I could put you on
Basses pumpin', told her I want in
Compton
Gansta shit, I manhandle my woman
We popped that champagne
Rolled up, paper planes
Chocolate chip, she wanna lick
Ice cream, Wu Tang

[Hook:  Hello Chi-City]
She say she know that shes young but she knows how to love
She say she know that shes young but she knows how to love
She say she know that shes young but she knows how to love
She say she know that shes young but she knows how to love

[Verse 2:  tabi Bonney]
We party, all night long
Lionel Richie, we gone
Sun rise, then sunset
I told y'all, we gone
Girls gone, wild style
Clean up on my isle
She wet, she bet
Her pussy cat is my pet
So what's up with that collar
I get one with my dollars
From now on, when other dudes speaks
She say no habla
Birthday suit and jewelry
You dont know what you do to me
So many things that I wanna do to you
I wish that there was two of me
She nasty, pickled eggs
Certain things she scared to just ask me
Whats your fantasy?
She high-tech, she hands-free
Her whip game: viscous
She ride her shit so ridiculous
She ride her shit so ridiculous
