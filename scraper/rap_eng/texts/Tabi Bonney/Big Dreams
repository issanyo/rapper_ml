[Verse 1:Tabi Bonney]
Life is such a seesaw, the ups and down now
I'm barely around no more
Eat lobster without the coleslaw
We doing pretty good so far
Out here, unprotected, they like damn Tab so raw
Around nothing but dope broads, with no panties and no bra
We like to be free, no inhibitions here bay
Sliding down the spiral staircase
The winners lounge, where I'll be found
Knowing I'm the greatest deep down
I'm going to need about three waiters just to take my order
Then we circle around the equator
Order everything catch me in everything
Could you imagine us having everything?
I mean everything, put that on everything
Dang, me and my big dreams

[Hook]
Big dreams, big dreams, big-big-big dreams
(Dang) Me and my big dreams
Big dreams, big dreams, big-big-big dreams
(Same) Me and my big dreams
Big dreams, big dreams, big-big-big dreams
(Dang) Me and my big dreams
Big dreams, big dreams, big-big-big dreams

[Verse:2]
I get so ahead of myself, sometimes I even need my help
Go ahead without me young, save yourself
My dreams are just too big
The things I want are just too sick
Nasty houses, mighty mouse, flights with no vouchers
Taking off anytime we want, mister big stuff
Who do you think you are?
Knowing damn well, I'm a super-superstar
And who are you? The power of it all
Hopes of millions and I don't play powerball
Tell me, do you even understand that feeling
I guess not at all
This is a special club, without the velvet ropes
This is more dope, and the bouncer can't let you up
The obsession of it all just might mess you up
But not us, we were built for this
In God we trust, young, some people even kill for this

[Hook]
Big dreams, big dreams, big-big-big dreams
(Dang) Me and my big dreams
Big dreams, big dreams, big-big-big dreams
(Same) Me and my big dreams

[Outro]
So maybe I can be your fantasy, oh-oh-oh
