[Hook]
I thought I had it all together
But I was led astray, the day you walked away
You were the clock that was ticking in my home
Changed my state of mind, with love so hard to find
Your feelings changed like the weather
Went from clear to grey
On that cloudy day
How can I go on without falling apart
Love's so hard to find, when someone's on your mind

[Verse 1: tabi Bonney]
And I thought we was cool
All I ever wanted was to cater to you
RSVP with a table for two
There was a couple of things I wasn't able to do
Wanted to take you there, capture your mind
Surely after that make you all mine
And yeah, I know your friends is hating now
But please allow me just to break it down
Take you on back to the day we met
At the Black Cat, right before I did my set
I shot my shot, and you did reject
After the show, I hit on that
I popped your [?] and you dropped your top
We rode on out, and you showed on out
And my favorite move is when pretty girl dip
And do that thing you do, you know you the shit

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: tabi Bonney]
And I think about, the good times we laugh about
We said forever, and now you cashing out
Mercy me, and you tap right out
Now other dudes asking you out
And I can't believe I see you out
So I blow up your phone, I stalk your house
So hard for me to just walk it out
You blocked my Twitter, and won't reconsider
That's petty as shit, I can't forgive her
And I seen a pic, of you and your man on Instagram
Yeah, he some shit but you still the shit
And it make me sick, to think about you with somebody else
God, I need help --- I can't let it go
I wish I could just let it go
