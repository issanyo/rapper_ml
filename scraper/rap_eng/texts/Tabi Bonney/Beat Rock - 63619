So everywhere I go yo, fans be like "Where you from?"
You know, whether it be New York or the UK
And I be like ummm... "I'm from DC"
Yeah, and they don't believe it, you know
So I just tell them this right here
"Let the beat rock, let the beat rock, let the beat rock..."
I said "Let it rock..."
"I'm from DC, I'm from DC"

I be rollin' with some dudes that always love to break the mother fucking rules
And yeah, know a couple D's that'll stir the shoes right off your mother fucking feet
Yeah, they be goin' hard all in the streets, make sure they don't take your heart

If you lookin' for a man that's on his two feet standing
You can go with me, you can go with me
If you wanna make it big and you wanna hang with the cool kids
You can roll with me, you can roll with me
You can roll with me, you can roll with me
Have you ever seen a fly guy, have you ever seen a fly guy?
Well if you ever see a fly guy, well if you ever see a fly guy

Let the beat rock, let the beat rock, let the beat rock
