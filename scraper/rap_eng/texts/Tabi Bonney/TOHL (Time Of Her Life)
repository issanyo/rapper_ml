(Today today is like a special day)
(Today today is like a special day)
[Tabi Bonney:]
She might, I can't wait
She might I can't wait
And I, hope she has the time of her life
Said I hope she has the time of her life yea
And I hope she has the time of her life
Said I hope she has the time of her life ...

[Verse tabi Bonney]
And we could go forever
I pick her up and tell her, exactly how I feel
And it just keep getting better
I'mma show her how to do it
But my heart told me cool it
Coolin' out with beautiful girls makes you foolish
And she just likes to party all the time (party all the time)
Be a couple years before she think about retiring
I told her that I love her; she told me that she like me
The possibility of losing her is what excites me
So babe do your thing, I just hold on to this ring
Just hit me when you're ready and maybe then we'll rock steady

[Hook:]

[Verse Fat Trel]
Your girlfriend my old thing
Low cut, nose ring
And we gonna try this one time, say her name was Sunshine
I unwind, while she drives
While we watch for that one time
Say she want a special day
Let her meet tabi Bonney
Me I'm so exciting know she like it she busting the K
I be like a viking I just might make her wifey today
She gonna keep me so icy so polite yea she lightin' the 'J'
Said she might, know she will I just got us both a pill
Murder the service you know I work them on overkill
Time of her life, she feeling right and she know the deal
She say I bet you won't, and I say I know she will
I'm loving her body language, my pockets got sex appeal
Popping these bottles, my life is just like a highlight reel
Break down the mollies think she flying I got a drill
Cop me a feel when my cup on spill
I got that eye of the tiger, but I'm a liar for real
I meant lion
