So I'm from Langdon Park
The North-East DC part
And we jive be coming up with stuff all the time
Different terms and stuff
Like "Put me in the pocket"
That's when somebody excites you, you know what I'm sayin?
You see a girl that's tight or somethin'
She "Put you in the pocket"
Yeah when you rockin' bammers, stylin' on 'em and stuff
Youngsta

[Verse 1]
I be jived out there
In the streets cruising
You might have seen me out there
Doing, anything but losing
If you fake I'm a put you out there
You might hear some "ooooing" (ooohh)
But I don't wanna take it there
So you know, I was all on point as usual
I can tell, cause people usually point and say that's crucial
Even though was forced I ain't never wear FUBU
Cause I ain't no bamma and the girls are no a boo-you
But if it's you, do you
I don't like to copy, I be on Moschino, Versace and Gucci
Baby lookin' sloppy, wonder why they ain't got no groupies
They ain't got no groupies
And I ain't just rap for a hobby
I do it for the groupies
Psych, pysch
I do it just to uhhhhh...

Put you in the pocket {*scratched and repeated*}
So put me in the pocket

[Verse 2]
I was on the phone with this girl that was extra girlie
She was being extra and tryin' to churn me
So I had to next her
She got problems with self-esteem
So that might affect her
My moms give me lectures
I been out of school for like, ten semesters
I got my diplomas to fall back on her
Soon as you turn around I'm right up on ya
You ain't got the heart if you ain't an organ donor
If she got a level head I'm right up on her
On her, on her
Speaking of head I'm go ahead and stay ahead at the mall
You can find Bonney Runway and boutiques, not the mall
The name is Tabi Bonney and all I can say is...

Put you in the pocket {*scratched and repeated*}
So put me in the pocket
