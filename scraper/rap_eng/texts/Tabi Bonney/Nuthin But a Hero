You are my super hero
I said I said
You are my super hero

Can I take you with me, can you come and get me
Where we going, we going to this place called stardom
If we leave now we can be there by autumn
Can we leave now, before everybody else try and be down
Before it's crowded and somebody catch a beat down
Before my ex girlfriend try to rebound
Everybody out there is a dreamer
So many rappers and singers
So many ballers and actors
This pretty girl want me to call her
If I was so attractive
To make people jump through hoops and back flips
Some end up on the mattress
To me man it ain't nothin but practice
Oh how I love to win
Get money and you could win
Get money, get money, get money, get........ get money, get money,get money like

(Hook)
You are my super hero
I said I said
You are my super hero

Can I take my cape off
Sit down and take the weight off
Nah aw, well is it ever gonna pay off
Cause I'm always on my grind everyday every night
I'm trying to figure out how to make it
If you gotta dream you better make sure you chase it
Because I live mine
I don't work a 9-5 I just rhyme

(Hook)
You are my super hero
I said I said
You are my super hero

Can we do this
While the rest of the world stay clueless
They'll catch on later
Hit the door close button on the elevator
Goin up now
So spittin everybody say whats up now
The view from the top is awesome
You should come up here more often
Ain't no losers up here we lost em
Welcome
This is the life we chose I suppose
We gonna get our money with a couple more Os O...ooooo
Now they get it
We live by ends ain't nothing fictitious
We dealin with a man with no fear in his heart
That's a man that's........... vicious

(Hook)
You are my super hero
I said I said
You are my super hero
