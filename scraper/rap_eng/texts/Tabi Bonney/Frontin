[Verse 1: tabi Bonney]
I'm a hustler, peddler --pusher
Salt n' pepper, I don't know how to tell her
But she look better, yes sir --- I'm leaving
Treason, guilty --- red-handedly filthy, explicit
Get it, police pay a visit like never
Sketchers, all of them around us
Cooked like a flounder
Booked, read them off the breaker
No look pass placer, don't fake
Buckets

[Verse 2: tabi Bonney]
Flush it, evidence is gone
Eatin' my custard like what's wrong
Accustomed to winning
Been denied corner like a loaner
Next week I'm hanging with Wynona Ryder
Get my driving shoes out the dryer
They don't belong, like you on a flyer
Finished up my custard like what's wrong
If you a superstar, they can't deny ya'
Prove them bamas' wrong, if not, they just gonna' call you a liar

[Verse 3: tabi Bonney]
Fishing, she told me that she miss me
Could it be that I was up on TV, miss me
Herb like Tim Duncan, never
Forever I be pumpin' like cocaine propeller planes in bad weather
Gettin' it, me and Lou --- we high top kickin' it
Me and London Michael, right-side drive, whippin' it
Yeah, I know it's sickenin' --- barf
Creating this type of living is an art
