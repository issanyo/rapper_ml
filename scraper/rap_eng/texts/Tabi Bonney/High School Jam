[Hook]
See me look into the mirror, and see how life is treating me
I could see all kinds of changes, that's really deep down inside of me

[Verse 1: tabi Bonney]
If I take you to Denny's, then we go together
I counted all my pennies, I got my Mork and Mindys
Cologne is Gucci Gucci, got on shorts like Bonaduce
Got extra coin so maybe after we can catch a movie
And sit all the way in the back
She said "Ain't no need for that, cause' you ain't gettin' that"
Oooo, she bustin' bubbles, poppin' bubble gum
She full of fire, least she ain't as subtle like them other ones
Baby hair all on her neck
I hope I get a kiss, me and my friends placed bets
Why do pretty girls make you wait for fucking ever
She told me 8 o' clock, about an hour later
Damn, she taking foreverrrrrrrr, shit
She said "Sorry for the wait"
I said "It's cool, you cool, you ain't really take that long
But ummm, you look fantastic as always
That's why the boys follow you through the hallways
And I'm so glad to be here tonight
You got me feeling like New Years tonight, or prom night
Minus the uhhhh, you know you know you know you know"
She said "Yea, I know I know", so

[Outro: tabi Bonney]
So I'm going to end it right there
I don't feel like rapping the rest
I'll tell ya'll the rest of the story and stuff
So, very very pretty girl --- you know, we go out
Went to the movies, sat all the way in the back of the theater
All the way in the back, it was only me and her there
Maybe one, or two other people but they couldn't see us
And umm, started kissing --- you know, I lift up her shirt
Started kissing on her titties and stuff, and then
She had hairy nipples, man (Oohhhhh)
I was done
