[Verse 1:Tabi Bonney]
They don't know what they missing here
Grab this moment, bottle it up before it disappear
Ain't no opponents, you can feel nothing but love in here
Speaking of love, I'm in a trance watching her derriere
Carrying on with no disregard
Seeing her crush a dude's world is my favorite part
She broke every heart, in here, except mine
To say the least, yeah, she's a beast and it's about that time
It's now or never, this my window. It don't get no better
My game like an open letter, while others rely on cheddar
And if the girl don't let him, my wing man will intercept her
She is like the beautifulest thing, but I ain't going to sweat her

[Hook:Terri Walker]
On and on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and on
It can go forever, you can call me your lover
So call me your lover, lover
On and on On and on On and on
On and on On and on On and on
It can go forever, you can call me your lover
So call me your lover, lover

[Verse:2]
I'm falling for her, and we ain't met yet
If she got a boyfriend send a death threat
If she got a girlfriend send a death threat
I'm committing murder, I'm the only one that can convert her
Like I'm overseas with a converter
Please just tell me that you know who she is
If she break my heart pick up the pieces
It's deadly as the she is
Then she got me tripping, rewind this back just to listen
Like this is a demo, hello
I'm tabi Bonney and you are gorgeous
Please God take my order
Just tell me what I got to do for all this
I put up my mother for adoption just to lock in
If there's no other option, she a goner, belly flopping in that water
I pray to God her ex's ain't distort her
I pray to God her ex's ain't record her
Fuck it, maybe she just did it for exposure
But what if she's the one that's ultimately getting over

[Hook]

[Outro:Terri walker]
The beautifulest thing I've ever known
Just shut your mouth and take me home
Boy gon' make me wait too long
Imma need a lover, a rock stone lover
The beautifulest lover, lover
