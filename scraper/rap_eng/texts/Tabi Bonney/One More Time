[Hook x2]
One more time, before you go
Can we, do it again

She told me what she made of
I found out more when we made love
How 'bout a encoure 'til we destruct
Do we need to always creep when we meet up
Steady making moves, this is day two
She quick on her feet, she rocking J's too
If I made you my girl, would we be true?
Or would we still be emotionally unavailable?
Your convenience is always convenient
Love the way you bob your head in agreement
You get rewarded for all of your achievements
Can we tape record it and privately screen it
Just a question, you Kim K destined
Them girls gon' hate but you just say F them
When me and you get together, no stressing
Let me know when we gon' do another session

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Phil Ade]
Oh baby give me one more chance
If not at love, let me get in them pants
I know it's my fault, I'mma fuck up
I always been humble, but my dick been stuck up
Shit got a mind of its own, hoes stroke its ego
I been tryna keep 'em at bay, Montego
But Clicquot and Rose to the head got 'em shipping out
And they be going off top, no written outs
I made you sit and doubt, if we would ever work
I knew that if we ever severed, it would never hurt
But once again, I was wrong
Now I got nothing left to do but beg on this song
So this is like Jodeci mixed with some Hova see
I been tryna grind, get mines here and overseas
You know it's hard for a nigga like Phil
So regardless of how you might feel, we should do it...
