"Barrel Brothers are doubled as monsters"

As we proceed, to give you want you need
There's nothing better motherfucker
So it's whatever motherfucker

[Verse 1: Torae]
It's what they all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for ain't it?
While niggas got famous, I camped in the lab and made bangers
The more heinous the bars the most flame it is
What’s more dangerous, denying the pad?
A beat tape from Oh No, my brother Sky in the lab
I’ll been dying to spazz
You niggas eating been dying to fast
Speaking my name shit you dying too fast
Still iron to blast, still caine that's still dying to flash
Illuminati still eyeing your cash
There's still rice, still trice, still slide you a pass
Full body cast and thrash, I'll body yo' ass
I mean
Pull the pull subtle shit let's puddle shit
Niggas mad moist I voice the choice of whoever I want it with
Another classic who offering the 24 team tear at your jean
[?] we corner shit

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Louie belts and rubber bands is my attire
D-Boys stance, my hand is by the fire
I been here to triple plans like the supplier
Palming itching, the money chance is like a choir
Ain't too many left on the land that I admire
So really I'm just rapping for me and a cramped tire
For the love of a double stanza hemp buyer
And a few expensive habits who prance like they Mariah
Pocket of the loot, I feel the groove and been a groove
Charm something and turn interviews to get a rooms
Back to the reason you know me
A reminder of these, the motherfuckers who running this from behind us
Heh, you feel different than getting good with your feeling though
Tell a bitch, "Please don't mind" like we was Philly's Most
Mad dog riser and scorpion Ben
Turn a record into contraband all you can be
Motherfuckers

[Verse 3: Torae]
So what we talking 'bout, fiction or fact?
We dealing with baking soda or we giving 'em crack?
You nickle and dime rhyming or you giving 'em stacks?
Light up the booth, I just go waving black
Ain't no holding me back
Came out the cage, untamed and wild
My pen game Steven J. Cannell
Type a page and pow
I aim and blaow my days is now
Your days is numbered fucking with the talk of the town

[Verse 4: Skyzoo]
Throw the drum into the race
The running of the apes
The flow feel like you took an onion to the face
Know that my day ones be the one up for the day
And they ain't coming to shows cause they coming off the waist
Hhhrung
Your retros are beyond words proper
I rap and turn a room into a nose first drop
And then the plot thickens at the top missing
And know that if I throw you a shot the shot's sticking

[Hook] {x2}
You talking 'bout us
You talking 'bout the talk of the town
We the only one's mentioned when they're talking the crown
We the only one's in it who ain't alter the sound
That ill shit that we bringing you now

"I told y'all"
