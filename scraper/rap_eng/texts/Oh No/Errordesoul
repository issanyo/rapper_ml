Yeah
Got an error in my soul
Error

Errordesoul

[Verse 1]
Yo
Got an error in my soul, I don’t know how it goes
Terror in my foes, gotta keep my mind closed
Rarer of the flows, kind of feel out of place
Stuck between fate and what’s on my dinner plate
Knowing that I grew up fine, feeling like I’m out of time
Peers keep moving but I’ve fallen out of line
Toke just to ease my mind, wrote, no second try’s
Want to please a woman who is looking real mighty fine
Deep down in my soul, feels real difficult
I want to make others happy but I’m pushed and pulled
By my own demons, who still keep breathing
And they ain’t leaving anytime soon either
Cold by the heater, Busch on the reverb
I’m still the one during winter wearing t-shirts
Like to keep the circle tight, don’t really like the light
So I keep on sleeping through the day until the night

[Verse 2]
There’s a glitch in the system, the snakes keep hissing
Dissing myself until I believe fiction
Used to be a real burning passion inside me
Now it is dead and in no way lively
Some days feel like I’m in an oasis
But still out of touch with my health, I’m faceless
Baseless claims seem to drive me insane
Stuck in the sand dunes and begging for rain
Plain and simple, I must get through, the shit that’s in front of me
Looking for a honey bee to comfort me
Running free, sunny heat, money be coming, see?
Wrong
I wrote this out of jealousy
Healing is a process, block out the nonsense
Error in my soul, am I out by the Palms yet?
Calmness yet to come, scars left from the ‘fun’?
Got to turn my shit around, bang, and I’m done
