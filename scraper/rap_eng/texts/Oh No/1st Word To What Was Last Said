[Verse 1]
You know we grind even when asleep like teeth
Ice cold bangers the beach summer heat
Told you dawgs that problems is coming
We Freddy Cruger on crabs that wanna sleep
Slipping outta position, then smash on 'em
You end up miss and put cash on 'em
Soldiers don't have to roll deep
25 hours, 8 days a week
Motherfuckers make room for these starving monsters
Live in the plot, tasting roofs
Yeah we call them stalkers
Elevated, fix world wide
That's the pride, I sponsor them
Only money's on your mind
Then we'll rob your conscience
Now, lets return the love to the music
Hell is toasted on both sides
This corn balls gotten a bit abusive
Record execs they lost their damn mind
Prince Po, malito when I wing it
So you can time travel through my cynic
Hit places we all never been
Like Starbucks selling lattes with gin

[Verse 2]
So many cats you thought whats focus is funny style
Assholes broke and running wild
Bout to get it, and I mean right now
Gotta eat, someway, somehow
And modern day hustlers lack logic
For petty crimes getting football numbers
When we all off-springs of royalty
You see the bal, you shook it all from us

[Verse 3]
Hunger from the hood
But when you got it good
We never gave back
I did, and stayed fat
Told you motherfuckers to
Stop getting the twisted
Oh, cause a ruckus with Po
Shit is the business
Now party! Like it's the last day on Earth
With Q-Nomics, can nobody Jones design this skirt
Shout it! To return you blood suckers to the dirt
Tsunamis, to remind us that life is worth (yesterday)
History (tomorrows)
Mystery (todays)
A gift, blaze an 8 a piff
Away from stress give jakes the slip
About to change cause my team's come equipped
