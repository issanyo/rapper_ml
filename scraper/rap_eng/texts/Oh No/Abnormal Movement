[Verse]
Yo
Sacred dialect cause an entire threat
Ark of the Covenant summoned by the Heaven-sent
Step through the sediment, no such medicine
Dizzy, sweep through, march with the regiment
Tedious journeys through the Sahara
Dehydration, a whole new era
Brick by brick built the Pyramid of Giza
Bitch bow down Iâ€™ll do anything to please ya
Slave labor is a favor for pharaohs
Watch your step and your dodging the arrows
Abnormal movements trip you like acid
Hallucinogens make you losing a hinge
All took place at the River Jordan
More important, we must deport it
Forget what you saw, ignore what is law
Power of God strike down, leave you in awe

[The Buschmaster]
That's funky bro
