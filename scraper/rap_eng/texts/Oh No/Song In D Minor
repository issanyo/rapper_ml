Take this how you have to
Or don't take it at all
Or don't take it at all, yeah
Poet pass the weak so don't sleep
I'ma do this in my key
So that I can understand..

[Verse 1: Declaime]
In these last times and days
This last session of life
Living life at the edge of a double edge knife
[What all am I?] we do wrong not right
And is that right? no it ain't
I ain't a saint but I know some truth
Open up my eyes way back in my youth
Before I [launch] my first two
I knew there was much more to it
We live to die and we all go through it
Blown all up, yup best watch your step
No longer "Can quiet be kept?"
Uh, woke up by most slept
This ain't no game
Individuals live their whole life the same
My title's Declaime
Poet pass the weak so don't sleep

It ain't all about tradition
No it ain't, it ain't all about you
No it ain't I never sleep 'cause I can't
'Cause I can't, yeah..

[Verse 2: Declaime]
Before I leave this place
I'ma leave a trace you can't erase
Face it, it's very basic
Like some of y'alls is
Showbiz showing your biz
Show is that last and final countdown
So here's how I get down
I break my neck to gain respect
Uh, man life ain't no joke
Especially living life broke
I call it being me
Rounds up time hearding humble people like sheep
Uh, it's time that they read what they sow
I hope that they know
And I let it be known
And I let it be known..

I don't care what you say
Or how you feel
All I know is God is real [2x]

[Verse 3: Declaime]
Is it just me?
Or can't we all see?
That we have been misguided
Fused and abused
One nation none to God
Is how we been fused together
With liberty and justice for all uh
But not all get to taste the piece of the pie
Not all have wealth, before they die..

Don't worry, about, the wicked
Don't envy those, who do, wrong
For light grasp they'll soon fade away
They'll soon fade away..

[Verse 4: Declaime]
Say it loud
I'm black and not proud
Bringing the dark clouds
Right at the light
Turn down the love instead of hugs
We push each other fight
In God sight
Is that ain't right?
Is that ain't right? yeah..

It's time for an awakening on this planet
I hope that you enjoyed to stay
It's time for an awakening on this planet..
