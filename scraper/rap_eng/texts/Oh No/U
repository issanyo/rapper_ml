[Verse 1]
Trying to take it all in, embrace it to the morning
Searching for ways to fall in, patience calling
Trying to keep it together, cats getting it twisted
I said it must be the weather, common sense they missed it
Priorities all wrong, friends ain't' friends no more
Bodies is sad songs, they hymns is limbs that's gone
Her thoughts were premeditated, she's not just your girl
She's a queen jaded, sedated in a beautiful world
Family lies, deceit, fall guys
Within the clique cooking up petty beefs, they small fries
Crooked cops run the blocks, but we still the mom and pops
Not caught in the confusion, it's time to organize
City cutting programs, land becoming no mans
Stands not allowed at our table, having no plans
Protected by our armor, artillery and karma
No unnecessary drama, just loyalty and honor

[Chorus]
What's good, is it conspiracy theories, or just hood
Are we a people that's simply misunderstood
Is it fear or if he was given a chance you would
Make it happen by any means
Do what you gotta do, go where gotta go, be who you gotta be
And that's U
Live you life, U
Get money, U
Live it up, U
Make it happen
Some are just living for riches, some are dying for change
Trying to get it in, while the problem remains
Some made greedy decisions, now they hiding in shame
Some not even a pot to piss in, mopping for a grain
See I'm trying to get mine, no time to explain
Bottom line break bread, with folks doing the same
Gotta grind, real players stay improving their game
Here I come getting paper, Yo we gotta maintain

[Verse 2]
It's like players no longer go deep, legislators don't tweet
Our babies tote heat, neighbors don't speak
Families challenge verbatim, some smoking that leak
Jeopardizing lessons from natives, I turn both cheeks
Concerns don't cease, still gotta fierce vendetta
Still burn, still a beast, slash and pierce your leather
Submerge the technique, perseverance forever
Prince Po playing for keeps, here cheers to the better
Run amok, bunch of cuts, fake lottery number ups
Mistrust, love and disgust, apologies blood and guts
Casualties of war, tragedy is at your door
Fuck all the formalities, nigga it's just us
Food clothing and shelter, artilleries that'll melt ya
You tripping of the vodka, should have added extra seltzer
Moving as one force, but we don't call it delta
Prince Po and Oh No, nasty habits fire that melt ya
Lets Go!

[Chorus]
