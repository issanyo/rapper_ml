(feat. Buckshot)

[Buckshot (Oh No):]
Yeah, uhh uhh uhh.. Oh No (yeah)
B.D.I
(This is for everybody, that starve in this shit)
(Y'all ready? I see y'all)

[Oh No:]
Ay, this is for my hustlin {niggas}
With so much to handle ain't no feelin in they fingers
That travel deep, even without they {niggas}
Cause the real knows that they still with us
My every day is no different than you and yours chillin
I'm cold, like pops when he was out in the road
Told that we gonna make a million; name is M.J. or Oh No
And every move is major independent without it bein slow roll
Tryin to smile goin through the bad times
That's why I stay high, and bang loud when I drive by
My eyes slightly shut, wide open
I'm watchin the time go by holdin in slow motion my hands
Can't take it back to the time back then
But I can get with Buckshot and start it over again
This is hip-hop like when it began; without the chains
And the trends to the ends be as real as it gets

[Chorus x2: Buckshot]
You can get yours, cause I'ma get mine
All we do is hustle, all day on the grind
It ain't a game how I live it
Insane how I live it, no fame how I live it

[Buckshot:]
There's a war goin on outside no man is safe from
You can run but you can't hide your face from
I take them to the blocks where the cops
Let off shots for fun, this is Brooklyn son
One, two, what y'all gonna do
When they kick in the door, put your face on they boots like
Uhh, this ain't game, this is real life
The shotty steel like, you see what your body feel like
Darkness, now you see the light from the arsonist
Set fire to the world, stompin this
Timbaland in that man chest cavity
Step to me emphatically, you know it's a tragedy
That's why I shine like halogens
With my hustle and my hooligans stay hollerin
Polishin, weak {niggas} off like old leathers
You wanna step up, but you know better

[Chorus]
[Buckshot:]
Oh, No, B.D.I
