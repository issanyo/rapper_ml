Keep it a hundred

[The Buschmaster]
Okay okay, we get it. We get it
Seriously

[Verse]
Okay, I try and I try just to keep it a hundred
Thrown with a clown straight down to the dungeon
Feeling outnumbered, I’m in a conundrum
Keep it a hundred? I need another outlet
The jungle is flooded, the deserts are storming
More in, this is the forming process of my brain pouring out constant nonsense
Striving for a hundred is a plague that’s intense
Pressure, the gesture of constant success
Breathe in, it’s time to take a few hits
You don’t need to be the one making huge hits
That’s as simple as it gets, but really is it bitch?
Pace yourself but don’t straight up throw in the towel
Hear the pain in my vowel, bullshit, I disavow
A hundred other ways in this game to make it pal
Strive for the best, that’s the only way how
