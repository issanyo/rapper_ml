[Intro]
There's a good chance that instead of being a hero, I'll make a bigger fool of myself than ever

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown
Oh no, we're doomed!

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I raise the bars for stars and quasars
That's the reason why I ain't on your radars
You'd have to be like NASA to see this high
Plus you'd have to be nastier to be this guy
To be this fly, you need a hoverboard and some jetpacks
The grand architect of the universe to bless tracks
You'd have to walk a mile in my shoes
To decipher all the complex styles that I use
Cause my brain's all crazy from the Ritalin they gave me
And even as a baby loud music didn't faze me
And even as a teenager rappers couldn't fade me
I never gave a fuck about the hoes who betrayed me
And traded me for somebody else, well they can have 'em
Thanks for the rides to school and orgasms
Thanks for the cellphone bills that got paid
Been a pimp day one since I first got laid
Took rap more serious about the ninth grade
When I first heard the first LP that Nas made
Nowadays music sound so weird
Everybody clothes are tight, everybody got a beard
It's like the end of days that every rap fan feared
'Til the savior appeared on the stage and they cheered
I daydreamed while I sat on the bus
Fantasizin' of these whack ass rappers I crush
One day I'll make my whole neighborhood hot
On the rooftop like I'm Snoopy or Woodstock
A Tribe Called Quest in the "Check the Rhime" video
There once was a dream but I did it though
Nah, I never gave a fuck what the rest did
Now I'm on tour makin' sure I'm well-rested
Thanks to my fam and the fans who invested
And always had my back when my faith got tested

[Hook: Kappa Gamma and Apathy]
Body in the trunk, gas tank low
Heading 'round and not a place to go
When the chips are down, would you hold me down
When I'm feeling like Charlie Brown
Money running out, bills so high
Just wanna float up to the sky
When the chips are down, would you hold me down
When I'm feeling like Charlie Brown
Money running out, bills so high

[Verse 2: Oh No]
Yo, I be feelin' like Charlie Brown
Or rather Pig Pen, from all that dirt I been in
The 'burbs and the blocks, the street curbs and the kitchen cookers
Sold nightmares, these dreams boy I got hookups
Back in the day was just a week ago
The memories gone, it's probably from that reefer smoke
A nigga play Aretha when I'm needin' hope
To see the folks later, they try to kick it like FIFA pro's
I lecture my sons about grades and chips
'Cause any drama is known to gray the wigs
I do what my favorites did and still do
So many try to make it, shit I'm just trying to make it through
So many really fake it, man I'm just gonna keep it true
Too many people hatin', gonna see how the evils do
I've seen a gang a rain clouds out in Cali skies
And felt turbulence without havin' a plane ride
Y'all killin' my high, killin' my vibe
Them drugs be... killin' me inside, kill me and die
I was never known for killin' with kind, I'll be killin' a blind
Script murder, like I'm loadin' the nine while I rhyme
Please excuse me, uh, the way I shouted was an uzi
I'm plottin' a movie, pop extras in the jacuzzi
Big dreams still livin' loosely, loose leafs, no loosies
The same bitches that was actin' bougie now they groupin' groupies
That wanna do me, do me
I spark a doobie that you call a doozie
Then bang that groupie in a fuckin' hooptie
Tell 'em I'm ballin' but right now, I'm doing iiiit
The type of dude you don't wanna have no kiiiids
The boy is just ridiculouuus
Look, clownin', that's a state of mind I live in
All bad when I pop the trunk, homie get in
No!

[Hook: Kappa Gamma and Apathy]
Body in the trunk, gas tank low
Heading 'round and not a place to go
When the chips are down, would you hold me down
When I'm feeling like Charlie Brown
Money running out, bills so high
Just wanna float up to the sky
When the chips are down, would you hold me down
When I'm feeling like Charlie Brown

[Outro]

"Keep the change ya filthy animal!"
