Yeah, let me take y’all for a ride
Hap in this bitch, let’s go, let’s go!
Pulled your hair come now
I told you ain’t come out
I told you ain’t come out
I told your.. come now
I’m tired of this lane mass hoes and lane mass bitches
I’m back to my west coast, and on to the riches
The road, the vicious circle act the chock, the sickness
The mads, the time father won’t stop for the living
The bread in the bridges, but broken every building
Seeing the home miss chillin, and the hopeless dinners
Back to the whole world for the life
And everybody’s pitchin
’cause life of bitches you die,so why I reach up in
God dope, but still broke, just another week and I’ma still smoke
If you all ain’t rich Nicki you poe, that’s what pops colder to me
So I took it the gold, no matter how much money you never clean to soul
When you know that I held tight, in the hell of sight
My mama named the last mike, ’cause I was guide like
Always had the insight, I take that flight
If anybody got rolls who make that right
I told you, everywhere I’m at
Face it, face it up
I told you, everywhere I go
Bangin and turn it up
I told you here or not
I told you here come now
I told your..
Check it!
I’m rollin’ up, the weed is broken up
I start to spit Lamborghini angie soapin up
Bring..my stuck, how you was going up
You just a doubt on the screen, not even showing up
On the scan, suckers only do what they can
So when the shit it’s the fan, then they start chocking up
Then they get on the stand and start to sing like a tool can
Get back in the street, in the street soak em up
It’s just another problem solved
He jumped out the window, while just watch them fall
Anything my fault ’cause it ain’t my call
These give me third degrees and try to break my balls
But I won’t fall ’cause I was raised to a bay to call
And stay low, my low low scrape the road
I’m in the mob like a fool clip ready to low
I go off to walk like a bomb, set you were slow
I told you, everywhere I’m at
Face it, face it up
I told you, everywhere I go
Bangin and turn it up
I told you here or not
I told you here come now
I told your..
