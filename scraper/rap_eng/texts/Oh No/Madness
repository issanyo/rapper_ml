Well I've chased a rainbow I have coveted gold
I've sat in the back of a long black Cadillac
Wondering where the hell I was going
But I know when I get there it ain't nothing at all oh no no no

Well I've a rare disease here in the palm of my hands
I've heard words so absurd cluttering up the world
Makes me feel like I should have known better
But I know when I get there it ain't nothing at all oh no no no no no

I have a way of losing things and I've just heard the biggest joke of all

I've succumbed to impulse fought off a violent streak
I have shouted no sense 'til it make me so weak
But I know when I get there it ain't nothing at all oh no no no no no

I have a way of losing things and I've just heard the biggest joke of all
