I haven't seen you for awhile
I use to think, I use to love you
Like you were the best girl
And no one was up above you
You never seen things from me to you
And what I played but today's a new day
With out you, can I love this way?

When you wake up put make up
Covering up the fake stuff
Pardon me if you break trust
Keep tellin' myself, this ain't love (2x)
Just lust then we always break up
You say you hate the assholes
Well DAMN just know you've made one!!

Use to fight for you and tell you
You were beautiful
Added up your fuck ups it was hard
But now your mutable; use to hear the lies
And didn't want them to be true
Or be heard all the time
But now I'm better off with out you!

I hate you, I'm just sittin' here alone
Reliving tensions
Now fuck you (3x) (I-hate-you)
Fuck what your sayin' girl (I-hate-you)
Ohh back and forth like

Break up - break up - break up
To make up (3x) (make up)

Now how you gunna tell me you like me first
And the whole time when I was good to you
With guys you will flirt
Make me feels stupid then I lose it
But I guess it was worse
I guess you didn't feel the same
'Cause in this play it didn't work
And as I watch these days go by
Not one time I tell myself to give this one more try
It's more like fuck you, I hate you
Change perspective of a women
1st months love and shit then it turns into something so confusing but then again that's just life. lost a women, lost the romance and that just ain't right..

*So fuck you, I hate you, glad I opened my eyes!
So fuck you, I hate you, your a hoe in disguise
BITCH! (I-hate-you)
I'm just sittin' here alone reliving tensions
Now fuck you (3x) (I-hate-you)
Fuck what your sayin' girl (I-hate-you)
Ohh back and forth...
