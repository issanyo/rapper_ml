[Hook]
I hear it already how people will criticize
Cover up their ears keep on telling lies
Keep on doing wrong keep on telling lies
Keep on doing wrong..

[Verse 1: Declaime]
Materialistic madness
Creatures of conflict
Killers and liers burn in the fires of hell
Until your eyeballs swurl and pop
Fake prophets and poets [know it's the inner days]
Just watch what you say
You are recorded, and will be judge
Corrupt cops, you try to move me
But I won't budge
I keep a grudge I'm doing God's will still
It's Illmindmuzik now watch how I use it
It's time for a change
Time to rearrange the structure with scripture
Paint a different picture
Head to the sky, when I be walking
Wherever whenever
Even solid brothers' egos get severed
The truth hurts, and I dare you to listen
Straight up heart felt funk
Boom this in your trunk
Or at the club it's all love
Go ahead and pay
I'ma earn my ticket through that great gate
You chose your faith
It's not too late for some
But others persist to be dumb
Just watch when it comes
The return of the true creator
Master innovator number one
He who gave his only son
For us to florish in bloom and blossom
'Til we all turn that rotten and wrong
I hear the same old song
Greed lies and lust
Backstabbing unjust
It's crucial and a must
That we put aside the flesh
Release that hate and stress
Unless, you wanna burn slowly
Like the unholy
You wanna burn slowly

[Hook]
I hear it already how people will criticize
Cover up their ears keep on telling lies
Keep on doing wrong keep on telling lies
Keep on doing wrong
I hear it already how people will criticize
Cover up their ears keep on telling lies
Keep on doing wrong keep on doing wrong
Keep on doing wrong..

This is Illmindmuzik
With a few words
From poet pass the weak so don't sleep..
