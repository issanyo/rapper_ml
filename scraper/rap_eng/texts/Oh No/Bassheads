[Intro]
Yeah, boy! Turn up that!
Ayo, turn up the…
Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass!
Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass!

[Verse 1: Oh No]
Just like a basshead, I can't live without my shit hittin'
The back of the car, it sound like somebody kickin' it
Pop the trunk where it all goes down
Then roll by slow just to shake up your town
And the whip is filled with that low bass sound
They say you won't be hearing anything you play it that loud

‘Cause of that, ‘cause of that
‘Cause of that, ‘cause of that
‘Cause of my, ‘cause of my
They say that, they say that

Then tell them all to back up
And let me get my space, homie
I see you mad, you ain't talkin', but yeah, your face show me
I'm at the light and I'm bumpin', you smell the dody?
Just turn it up louder as soon as you pass the police
Maxing up the volume, like, "Fuck it! You cannot own me."
Tell him that you don’t know me, talk to the sub only

That's the, that's the…
That's the, that's the…
That's the, that's the…

[Hook]
Y'all can't fuck with my!
Y'all can't fuck with my!
Y'all can't fuck with my!

Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass!
Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass!

[Verse 2: The Alchemist]
All systems loaded, revenge of Johnny 5
Equalizer like blink while I keep the party live
Impressed to fly robot with my dance steps
Bunny man, Roger Rabbit and electric slide
These are robotic sweat drippin' from off my helmet
To my pelvis and now all of my circuits fried

Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass!
Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass!

Bass line's movin', make a rocka move
Party people, you are now under my hypnosis
Robotic arm contacts the needle to the groove
As I proceed to command party people to move
I zip-zip switch into mode and get busy
Humanoids dance around until their dome gets dizzy
From all the…

Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass!
Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass!

[Hook]
Y'all can't fuck with my!
Y'all can't fuck with my!
Y'all can't fuck with my!

Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass!
Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass! Bass!
