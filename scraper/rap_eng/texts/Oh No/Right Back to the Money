[Intro]

[Hook: King Harris]


[Verse 1: King Harris]
Here they trying to put me on my grave early
Hundred ca' better
Riding

Ran into my nigga I ain't seen a week
Heard they kill lil' nigga
Thought that shit is crazy
Peep that in his eyes, but a nigga never said a thing
All you niggas mad cuz' I putting work
Came up from the bottom, where they get
Prison institution you can die tryin'
Hit em up
But I get right back to the money
They tryin'

All you niggas better know

[Bridge: King Harris]
Said I am give it, give it to you baby
Said I am give it, give it to you baby
Said I am give it, give it to you baby
Said I am give it, give it to you baby

[Verse 2: King Harris]
So what's the issue
If they with you, then they with you nigga
Oh when you die because
Must be the money and the bitches
They can keep up with you
My nigga B...pullin' up
I heard


[Hook]
I don't give a fuck about your click nigga
Never gave a fuck about a bitch, nigga
Word around the town, you a snitch nigga
Laid back ?
I get right back to the money, right back to the money
I get right back to the money, right back to the money
I get right back to the money, right back to the money
I get right back to the money, right back to the money

[Verse 3: The Game]
Open the oven, close the freezer
Keep these bitches on ice, cuz these hoes is leaches
If I am the game then, who in the bleaches
I'll leave nigga sleep outside like Kanye sneakers
Bust the speakers like Dre ...on
Grew up, screwed up, Wu-Tang in mama side
17 puffin' on Bob Marley
So high, start confusing bitches like Steve Harley
Murder mase nah, I am old Jada
Fuck a hater, you niggas is .... Al Quade
Black ghost, sittin' on chrome rims
Coming to the hood like the ghost of Al Davis
From ...?
To becoming a king and murdering
Understand the topic, most of you niggas...? shit
I pull up, baller alert, fuck the gossip

[Hook]
I don't give a fuck about your click nigga
Never gave a fuck about a bitch, nigga
Word around the town, you a snitch nigga
Laid back ?
I get right back to the money, right back to the money
I get right back to the money, right back to the money
I get right back to the money, right back to the money
I get right back to the money, right back to the money
