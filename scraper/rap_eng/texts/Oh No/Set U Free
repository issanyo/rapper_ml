[Intro]
Take my Mic down a lil' bit
Yoo, aha
Come with the hook

[Hook]
Can't you see (Can't you see!)
The things that matter are (The things that really matter are!)
Gonna set you free(Set yourself free!)

[Verse 1:Wise Intelligent]
When I think of all the riches we attain, via rap black slang, even crack cocaine, I
Ask myself is it ever really worth it when its all so surface and a nigga lack purpose, Why
Do I bother tryna' figure out the meaning of a life so demeaning for a necklace i'll die, My
Baby momma into Dolce&Gabanna all her sisters into Prada and they never buy books!
Now all they baby's rockin' hundred dollar sneakers having problems with they teachers, educations not a factor
And some rappers make it clear that nuttin' matters, the pursuit of stackin' papers breeding younger gun clappers
And now the teachers and the preachers and the pastors out here searching for solutions, Let me say it ain't religion!
It ain't money politics and economics, cos the black mans problem is a fucking lack of knowledge

[Hook]x2
Can't you see (Can't you see!)
The things that matter are (The things that really matter are!)
Gonna set you free(Set yourself free!)

[Verse 2:Wise Intelligent]
Hes just a baby on the front line wilin' cos his pappa rock a ???, and his momma can't cope
So his momma smoke coke, in the winter no coat, running sales in the summer till his sneakers lack soles, Since
Black Radio done sold its soul and became a gossip column that contributes to the violence, Uh
Moment of silence for the dead black race that measures life by the inches on a chrome set of spinners
And us niggas who done made a lil' money, out here killing one another buncha god damn dummys
It's not funny, it's the absolute truth, half the doe' we spend on lawyers could be goin' to the youth
Got whippers
Got bitches
Got beef
Got guns
Got 99' problems that resort from 1
Not rap
Not ebonics
Not the ghetto or the violence
Cos the black mans problem is a fucking lack of knowledge

[Hook]
Can't you see (Can't you see!)
The things that matter are (The things that really matter are!)
Gonna set you free(Set yourself free!)

[Verse 3:Wise Intelligent]
Niggas acting like the world done change, since they made a lil' change and a rapper won a Grammy, Shit
Niggas mistaken black people as a nation in the worst situation than the days of plantation, Rich
Niggas of color never reach out to they brothers who surviving in these gutters by the strip for triple beams, seems
Poor people lack the resources and the means to support the hearts desire to pursue the right things, I
Find it hard to teach the people when they're hungry, cos the baby's gotta eat and everything cost money, But
No excuses we become a race of losers and the other nations use us for they come up when they choose tuh'
And now the elders act like we the reason why, as if our generation fell from out the fuckin' sky
I guess the food have fallen further from the trees, cos' nobody wants to harvest what have become of black seeds

[Hook]
Can't you see (Can't you see!)
The things that matter are (The things that really matter are!)
Gonna set you free(Set yourself free!)
