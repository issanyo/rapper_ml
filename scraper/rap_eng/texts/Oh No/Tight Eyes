Let's go out
Hey we just made
Happy hour
We must be tight
Let's go out
We must be tight
Let's go out

[Verse 1]
Yo
We roll tight I'm like a pimp in a song
Tipping the (?)
Ice cold apple and rum
K. Jack Oh No in your city like shimmer
Tight eyes stay lifted nigga how we hit you
If ya
Smoke the good green and sip them sixteens
And shots of the Patron getting your mind free
Tight eyes have these girls looking Siamese
Four breastestes she like a dime and a half
You see it all day in south Texas
To them scallywags, head for the exit
Knuckle dragging wildebeest please get kinetic 'cause
You all in my personal space
Got a bad attitude and you hurt in the face
Ew
My eyes ain't that tight babe
But a couple of drinks and you might be that right way
Yo Oh pass the Miller Lite my way
I'm getting so tight, oh

[Verse 2]
Yah
What up Kay
Let's burn something
Ay
I had to make a late entrance
Out the whip with the low vision
Green addiction
Tight
Keep listening
Drinks if free before ten
But I'm a ghetto nigga
So Imma drink before I get in
That's the Hen and Patron
Vodkas and all
And we can get popping from now 'til tomorrow
When the cash in involved
Add the Afghan hash
Then its on
If that's a mystery then it's solved
If you ho's at home
Then that's a house call (Hello?)
We at the club door
Let's slip to the backyard
Ay
My nigga Kay let's smoke this kush
Keep my eyes wide shut, I'm cooked
Been a long time coming
And I ain't talking about Sam Cooke
Oh got more play than a coach's handbook
Tight
I'm feeling good in your area
Holding on two drinks
So love I can't really carry you
But you can follow me
Like Oh's odyssey
So high you gon' think you won the lottery
