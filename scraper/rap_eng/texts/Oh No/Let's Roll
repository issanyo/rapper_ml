[Verse 1: Damani]
Swag ain't enough to describe my vibe
You can't copy what I got inside
This is God given
Mixed with hard livin'
With a misunderstood respect for all women
I call a bitch a bitch
Not even a black woman's carcass can make me switch
I don't sugar coat
I let the words float
And land where they may
And if they stick that's where they supposed to stay
Player my nature not by choice
I just rhyme like this I can't control my voice
Rolls Royce Phantom dipping down the block
Windows down and yes, this be the anthem
Random numbers pop up in my phone
And these little chickens won't leave me alone
C'mon!
As I let down the roof
This truth was started outside the booth

[Hook]
It all started
When we seen these bitches
We seen these hoes
Ya'll know x2
That a pimp this tight gotta get that dough
Fo sure x2
And I'm chillin in the back
And I feel like a mac
So let's roll x4

[Verse 2: Damani]
They say Damani
Ain't you worried about karma?
I treat 'em like shell and let that be the armour
Harbour a ho is no way to live
After every work day, I need first dibs
Anti West Haven
I give 'em more trouble than Wes Craven
No breaks, no mistakes, no give that
I gave you game bitch, now it's your turn to give back
Let me help you
That's the motto
Shit, everyday it's like I hit the lotto
All whites ? lil' ass skirts and tops
That's the uniform for us to be on top
Don't worry about the cops baby they prepaid
Just focus on the money that we made
Take this switchblade
Put it in your purse
So if a trick wanna trip, you can cut him where it hurts

[Hook]
It all started
When we seen these bitches
We seen these hoes
Ya'll know x2
That a pimp this tight gotta get that dough
Fo sure x2
And I'm chillin in the back
And I feel like a mac
So let's roll x4
