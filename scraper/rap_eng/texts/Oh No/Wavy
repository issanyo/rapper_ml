[Verse 1: Prince Po]
See this here's a jungle, and I'm a whole different animal
Most endangered species, nare nigga compatible
Humans try to reach these, depends what they hairs like
Sewer rats want moon cheese, call me Splinter Vanderite
Slick Rick, quick pick, plan strategic
Flip a lick, dipstick, lay in it until I read it
Problems are small and made to be solved, that's true glory
When I'm involved it's all big business, true story
I spit [?] with true fellas that shine with me
Strictly Kangols, New Eras and 59Fiftys
Killing with the linen, rocking a matching Fedora
Chillin' in Yemen, swimming with dolphins in Bora Bora
Good food for your sexual appetite
Ma here's a hood groove, bless you just for acting right
Lapping up your kitty pop, tapping with my strong arm
Poppy had a diddy bop, long before Sean John
Forever spicy like jalapeños and Texas Pete
Never been like me to dumb it down going extra sweet
I'm straight funk like live at the Apollo
Earthquake your trunk, making you ride that Rallo
Shaking your shoulders, shake it through the city
Mommy shaking it with her girlfriend, shaking her little titty
Hands up cool, respectfully nasty
Po's a stand up dude, you'd be blessed to get half me

[Hook]
Yo X we stay next keeping it wavy,…Wavy
You know every time I come through it's crazy
Didn't want do it to em' but they made me
Wavy,…Wavy

[Sadat X]
Feeling good, looking good, staying good, no good

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
You ever got bathed in Brazil, by two bad bitches that'll make time still
The opportunity hawker, you stuck on the pavement
You take the road the slave went, your name is no imprint
Shit I didn't invent, gotta find an angle though
Let a dollar dangle... No!, Spectacular
More live subtractular, at shows you get exposed
Keep all your ex hoes, Jesus Whoa
Throw the stone away, come to my going away
I'm back on the bird to a land you never heard
Where's your passport
Land dweller, hand to hand seller, not the God
Rock a wave if you down with this hoe, we hitting' [?]
Eat a [?], frequent flyer
South of France and the summertime is fire, party off the flyer
Same old lames, broad got game
It's foreign fox in [?]
And Euro, the God is [?]

[Hook]
Wavy,…Wavy
You know every time I'm come through, it's crazy
Didn't want to do it to em' but they made me
Wavy,…Wavy
