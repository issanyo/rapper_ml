[Sample] :
Just 'cause I don't want to act like a fool all night long don't mean I can't! I can!

[Beat starts]


[Declaime] :
I can't talk about hoes 'cause I ain't no pimp
But still walk wit a limp
Lounge and get lit, y'all talk shit, get hit
With this verbal bullet
Pull your gat back so you can feel it and steal it
Copy it and then kill it
Walkman flavor at its finest and my whole crew's the highest
Just waitin' to laugh till their time to shine
Lootpack stepped up and just left niggas blind
Backspin with mill ninety ninety nine hoes
Step up get snuffed, right there in the nose
Knuckles here and I equip, now i'm shootin' this up
When I get here through this music, you just can't shut me up
Put me down, when I get down with the underground
This better down here. I just trip how they sound
All dirty and shit
Static breaks, loops and shit
Bounce to Crowd right like the Holy Spirit
I feel it deep in my bones. I'm here to take out all clones

[Hook :]
It's my way of music
So don't trip
And watch the way I use it
Don't trip
A Madlib invasion
Don't trip
Declaime and Lord Quas
Dont trip

[Quasinoto] :
Y'all niggas sham like y'all rolling on weight
Your masquerade is hypocritical, y'all heading for fate
Making the rap game look pitiful
(Man What they doing?)
If it was up to me, we would get rid of y'all
Put a lid on all y'all fake ass niggas contradicting
(I ain't say that!)
But when I drop my shit it's like I put my dick in
The snare kickin', Madlib rush through, thinkin'
(Yeah, I got beats for y'all to battle right here)
Now watch the plot thicken
I shut my ears while you run the lip service
On purpose
And get nervous, 'cause I'm about to serve this

[Hook :]
It's my way of music
So don't trip
And watch the way we use it
Don't trip
A Madlib invasion
Don't trip
Declaime and Lord Quas
Dont trip
It's my way of music
So don't trip
And watch the way we use it
Don't trip
A Madlib invasion
Don't trip
Declaime and Lord Quas
Dont trip

[Declaime] :
Bust your ear in this
All y'all sit back and listen to my way of display
The words that I say
I spit in the rear
Right not wrong
I just fight, jump and dusk till dawn
Ill mind emcees who I be?
Straight from the W-E-S-T
So don't trip
Nigga used to be a gunslinger for the 5 golden years
The 40 on my lap, that's why they took my license back
Don't trip (Don't trip) X2
See God gave this gift to me so I was destined to use it
Uplifted this here, never abuse it

Don't worry i'll continue the track and perfect it!
