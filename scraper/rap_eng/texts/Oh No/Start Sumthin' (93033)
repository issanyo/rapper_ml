[Chorus: Oh No]
We gone get it cracking, get this fucker popping
This is what could happen when you let us get it started
Start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin
Start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin

[Verse I: Roc C]
Nine-three-o-thirty-third, the boy’s absurd
Fuck what you heard, no longer slanging on the curb
Fiends on my nerves, know to make a bucko feel reckless
My death wish, next shit, none want to test this
My message, get back, lay low, get cracked
Got to make dough stacks, rock the big payback
Every time rhymes coming out of your speaker
Words hit your eardrums, so the thoughts get deeper
Oh heard the boy flow, now Roc’s a keeper
No longer spit fire, nowadays I breath ether
The streetsweeper, my band of brothers keep an
I’m in state of shock, watch out, play the block
Attitudes get shot, won’t stop, gone pop, on lock
I’m hot, you not, and I don’t need no dots
Stop ‘fore you write a check your ass can’t cash me
And my crew stay ready to smash, let’s go nigga

[Chorus: Oh No]
We gone get it cracking, get this fucker popping
This is what could happen when you let us get it started
Start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin
Start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin

[Verse II: Oh No]
The only thing you shoot was film, we get score like sells
Scars like the keloid off my ear, nigga
And I am not here for your enjoyment
I am just here for your girl’s employment
She gave me the job to just work the loop
And I’m the reason for your home improvement ‘cause I screw chickens
And roll with the sinister six, my sense is just that intense
Extraordinary gentleman - in a league of hustlers
With weed, I’m a doctor, without it, my hands might pummel ya
And get government, meaning might cover up
Then no one can find ya ‘cause you been disrupted
Disconnected, read the words backwards, dyslexic
My whole technology is on next shit
My street mentality is like Tetris
‘Bout to drop lines of clear blocks till you get the message, you better

[Chorus: Oh No]
We gone get it cracking, get this fucker popping
This is what could happen when you let us get it started
Start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin
Start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin’, start sumthin
