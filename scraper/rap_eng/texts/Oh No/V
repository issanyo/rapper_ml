[Kool A.D.]
Blood state, iron horse, last stop manifest destiny
Rewind, the bullet go back in the gun
Rapping in tongues, seem me no circular circular love
N'est pas Anglais? No en Ingles, it's not English
Rikki tikki tan rikki tan tan rikki tikki tan rikki tikki tan
Rikki tikki tan rikki tan tan rikki tan rikki tikki tan

Circumstantial, see me pull my own abstract out the backpack
Fuck it I don't even really want that, you can have that
So far a couple hundred G's for a one letter signature, V
See my literary history, your military couldn't do shit to me
My name is in the beginning of victory
I live up in the spirit of your children, I'm in the building

Ocho, kool dolo, shout to Oh No, fuck the Po-po
But you already know though, ya tu sabes yo no sabo nado, na though
We eating, pero fuck Monsanto
Shout out to Squanto, Geronimo, Cochise, Sitting Bull, Red Cloud, Crazy Horse, Victorio
Y'all know how the story go, guts and the glory and hasta la victoria siempre, para la gente
P'al pueblo, shout to mi Abuelo en el cielo, my yellow high mellow
Hunters Point that's my ghetto, Alameda that was my meadow

Now the fam rests in the west though
People like "Kool how you blessed with the best flow?"
I be like "'blessed with the best flow'?"
They be like "pssfch, you know what I mean"
I be like "I guess so" I guess I'm just lucky, I guess yo
Used to be all like "Yes please, test me" then I graduated
Now I'm just doing my thing, you prolly mad, you hate it
I'm like Drake in that I admit I exaggerated
But labels been wanting to sign the Kid like an affidavit
Catch head like activators, smack a hater
Kool A.D. soul captivator
