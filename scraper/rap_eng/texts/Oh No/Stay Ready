[Verse 1 - Planet Asia]
Yeah
The jewels that we invest in...
From the struggle I came, where no one can remain
And if you from the bottom mane, then we one and the same
This day to day is like having a gun to the brain
And I ain’t trying to run the world, I’m just running my lane
The face of my uncle was real, men sharpen men like steel
Why the narcs put marks on our bills
Fatherless, no direction but still blessed
Even though a lot of my family come from real sets
All over America -it’s an epidemic of cutbacks, layoffs
Without a day off, I’m pressed to get it
Some will stoop low for green pupils
And new acceptance, and you accept this?
For whose the most affected - check it
I keep my family close just like a weapon
But I don’t use ‘em for protection - I use ‘em for direction
My music is with a message of strength
Jewels that I invested in to finesse

[Refrain - Planet Asia]
From the struggle I came, where no one can remain
And if you from the bottom mane, then we one and the same
This day to day is like having a gun to the brain
And I ain’t trying to run the world, I’m just running my lane

[Hook - Nio Tha Gift]
When the streets get colder the pain is heavy
(You know the pain is heavy)
When it rains it pours, you better stay ready
(Ya better stay ready)
When the streets get colder the pain is heavy
(Hey)
Whe it rains it pours, you better stay ready
(You better stay on your toes)

[Verse 2 - Dengee]
Cruising on the freeway, slumped back bumping to P.A
Reminiscing ‘bout T.K., on my toes like plier
Not guilty is my plea (ay), middle finger to D.A
Smokin on that finest, I’m buying time like a pre-paid
Baseball on these phones, the police be on three way
Listening to what we say, catch me that will be D-Day
To M.I.A. from C.A., to Puerto Rico for B-Day
Patron shots on a yacht and a bad bitch from Chile
I dream big don’t I?
Funny thing is I don’t sleep - this how I live, no lie
But when I come back to my hood, diss songs, oh my
What’s going on, I never did these niggas wrong
So why do they want me gone
Bro told me this day will come, he ain’t think that I’d listen
But I did - how you think I put myself in position
Undercover suckers, I should let you kill each other
But I’d rather give a hand to you jealous mother fuckers

[Verse 3 - Mistah F.A.B.]
Yeah, it’s Mistah F.A.B
You can, you can...
Block my road but can’t block my thoughts
Looking at overseas, shaking my head at money I lost
Glamour and glitz, had me hidin’ behind these name brands
Life on the line, you seen my city on Gangland
But long as my fashion was right
I never paid too much attention to the Passion of Christ
Too busy flashing this ice, yeah my passion was ice
Had me living for the now, not after this life
But things changed, when my Earth gave birth, to my first
Soon as my daughter was born, put my life in reverse
Slowed down, stopped living for the riches and buzz
Sobered up, told myself no more liquor and blunts
Preparing for weather changes in the middle of war
Bought some umbrellas man, cause when it rains, it pours
This how it is, on the struggle every day
P.A. - My bad for the delay, O.K
