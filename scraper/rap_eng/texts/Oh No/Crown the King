Oh No
Check It Out
Ayo whirlwind is spirited
Structured it like a pyramid
With slick talk gibberish dealers who move ignorant
Benevolent, omnipotent, mathematical instrument
Equivalent to killin' and scramblin' for the dividends
Experience the essence of aswar
Malachi, ?? with hundreds of bad scars
The iron horse, go to war with lion hearts
While the blood of a slave engraves my dying thoughts
Print poetry, potent, it's a croaker when you're smokin' it
The ministry is open I encourage y'all to soak in it
I'm Malcolm in the window, Martin on the balcony
I got a strange feelin' that the bot for me is out for me
The last seance, burn incense and pray on
I rap senseless and send shots through your way on
Out of the essence, carry seals for protection
My mind is a weapon, only used for progression
