[Aesop Rock]
Hey, I don't need a reason to rebel
I sneak into the club, I ain't leavin' without a pelt
For the people feelin' needlessly beleaguered at the helm
Tryna ease up out the nucleus and bleed into the hills

I'm a, old sea dog sippin' on fizz
My ilk still put skate stickers on the fridge
Ate dinner at the Denny's with a dumbed out coven
In the company of uninvited bloodhounds huffin'

Tough crowd, he the chew the cud king
Aw crud, thing one and two in one thing
None drum up any drama for the Huffy
I ain't even lift a glove up out the pockets of the puffy

Once I don't know frozen food, homie
The acid in my stomach eat bones and hooves
I re-home lone wolves, let em'  socialize a little bit
Learn pack policy, turn you all to pick up sticks

Rebel rebel, fuck a precious metal
I'm the dopest gettin' cozy with a pencil and a level
The mostly grown-up Mowgli keep a scepter in the tendril
Here to walk into the light with the excessively disheveled

Shovels on our shoulders, spinning out of the nothingness
Roaches in our honeycombs, nothing in our moneyclips
Bass in our media, spirits in our computers
Sad trombones in our futures, troopers

[Chorus]
I don't ever get too comfy
I don't like to own much stuff
I ain't really wanna unpack
If it goes down, I'mma jump up
If it goes down, I'mma jump up
If it goes down, I'mma jump up

[Homeboy Sandman]
Solo dolo on a late night, holdin' thousands
An old brown rock and four talismans
Schemin' on a power play, underneath an urban sombrero
Peep the goods, son; surf's up in the sub zero

Started each negotiation takin' or leavin' it
Type of shit that only come from livin' and breathin' it
King digéré, crossin' the Mojave
Due to highway robbery, thievery

Sudden moves will scare away hiccups
Awesome how I orchestrate drop-offs pick-ups
This is what I trained for; no get-up, it's a gi
Everything is paid for, everything is free

You already know about the girth
This the type of shit that leave a glow around the earth
Namaste, 'cause I was lost but now I'm saved
But it was slaves that built the Church

So just pretend in misty watercolor memories of the way we were
The service light's too dim to find the bit to find that's tryna find a cure
It's divine to forgive but it's human to err
But breakin' out when danger's loomin' is even human-er

Jokes are all on the inside
Stock a' awkward silences for comin' in handy
Catch you all on the flip side
Off to catch some hate from my immediate family

[Chorus]
I don't ever get too comfy
I don't like to own much stuff
I ain't really wanna unpack
If it goes down, I'mma jump up
If it goes down, I'mma jump up
If it goes down, I'mma jump up
