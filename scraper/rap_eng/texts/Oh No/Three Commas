What you do in three a years
I do in one, sunny got sun
Everything that i done, ain't enough
Still goin
I don't think we'll ever have enough
Uh, better watch your step son
You half stepin' a marathon
There is no comparisons to me
Or my team (mmmm)
Now you tryna fuck with me
Get the fuck out my face bitch
Get the fuck out my face hoe, with me
Uh, yea get the fuck out my face hoe get the fuck out my face bitch
Three commas, Three commas
I heard call me what you want
But you can't call me broke
Don't need a teliscope just so you could see I'm dope
Dont need a teliscope
Just to see i got hoes
Been in this game
And im planning on more
And im running this game
And you wanted that more
All my click is crazy
Damn we so jurassic park
You be with the guppies
And i be out with them tigger sharks
I over throw your city man no wonder i got casher in
Yea i fuck your bitch
And ran you up
And that was accidently
Ahhh my squadd is gully and irrational always kill the game
And just what me it looks so casual catch me with some badder hoes
Some sprain your ankle type of hoes
These bitches with some bulls
And you be lookin at the matador ahhh my squad is repin
Ahh my squad is repin
Swavy club on my back
Ahh my squadd is reppin reppin me
Nah


OHNO- Three Commas Lyrics
