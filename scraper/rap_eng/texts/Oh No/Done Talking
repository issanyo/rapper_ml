[Intro]
-We came from kings and queens
-That's right
-How come we ain't got any kings and queens right now?
-Come on, boy, you always trying to be heavier than anybody else
-Cause there's too many people
-They did their thing, then they died
-Either they run out of time, or killed
-Where's the now people to do things now
-We're always talking about "what's been"; never "what is"
-What are the people gonna do?
-I'll think about it

[Verse 1]
Bomb the levy, armed and deadly
Arm is steady, fingers, palms is sweaty
Shoot holes through your medley, wifey so heady
I'm heavy, so ready, box your face out, be the man Freddie
Chopped confetti with a sharp machete
Got no flavor, no sauce, plain spaghetti
I spit legend like Yeti
Search for extraterrestrial intelligence- SETI
Anything pertaining to Eddy
Went through Special K and then through Teddy
Child support, bank levy, house foreclosed
Freddie Mac and Freddie, why you singing to my medley?
Good broad, the hood is hard
Pull your card, fought while you sparred
Banned and barred, my hand to God
Your odds are good, but goods are odd
I'm done talking

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's beautiful and aggravating
Agitating, glad you're hating, mouth salivating
Your heart palpitation is an indication
You wanna suppress innovation?
No limitation, flow been impatient
Smack DJ's, kick stations and corporations
You can all suck my dictation
Here's what you're now facing
Edo what close and personal, no more giving spacing
Start bracing or start embracing
Old dogs become soap, greyhound racing
This ain't a playground chasing
Real life, you're fake like Freddy and Jason
Get this boom back, start de-basing
I'm half the price, they're twice as much
My fingerprints don't fade from the lifes I touch
I'm done talking

[Hook]
