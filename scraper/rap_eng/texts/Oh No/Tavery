[Oh No]

Yeah, my attitude is right
This is the symphony of the night
So nigga fuck whoever's wrong or right
It's Oh-Knuckle on this mic device
I write like a gladiator going to war
Then fight to death
What I spit easily snatch your breath
Kill what you rep, it's better to live life
Than to live death
Full situations, you better be respectful
For too much disrespect can cause the whole nation to fold
And now stories is told
Besides Oh, your ace in the hole
I roll with Roc, let the beef alone
Damn niggas is cold
The only thing to offer duke is to grab six feet of land
And throw it on top of you
Be unstoppable, mic dynamic, superhuman power
My binna watch the rain shower
Black power pie, soul defying the cowards by the ounces
Dilla got your five skates bouncing

[Hook, Oh No, Roc C]

Move, out of ma way dog get it straight
Move, look around watch the block levitate
Move, man I ain't tryin' to operate
One false move watch the whole world detonate

X2

[Roc C]

Move, I'm coming fresh from the gutter
Got to see my way through one way or another
I build the flame, feed the fire
Won't stop being Roc till I retire, yeah
I'm running the truth and running with liars
The niggas in your clique ain't nothin' to admire
Only reason you're hot, your man told you so
Don't even compare to the shit in my toilet bowl
Nah, I'm too woozy to make it a fail
I'm on a one way ticket to hell
My life's wild like Chenille wearing Chanel
Keep on till I'm over the hill
Packaged up like a bottle of pills
Huh, I know that the drama is real
A shot of liquor make a nigga heart spill
Like Hitler, I smoke blunts on the shitter
Nigga, fucked up like a bitch shaving her brow
Last time I checked my life's about to spray

[Hook, Oh No, Roc C]

[Roc C]

Move, yeah nigga move and get moved the fuck over
Only gonna say it one time
Oh No, Roc, Dilla dog
