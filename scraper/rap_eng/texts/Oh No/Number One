[Verse 1: Cities Aviv]
John Proof, presidential lock city Thursday
Tell the blunt they should run quickly
On sight catch a buck fifty
No means, nigga, move swiftly
True story if you try to be the first motherfucker to die
Shout peace mode, ravers have some clothes in my eye
Laid up and between two voluptuous thighs
I forgot all the persuasion, I can't even describe
So beautiful, so spiritual, unusual
O2 caddy scraping over San Coover
Money I for some roof like I'm Larry Hoover
With no affiliation, shout to my relation

[Hook]
I'm trying hard each day to find a way
To get back to being number one
If I can make it sweeter to you
You'd have no need to run

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Step in the building like I own this shit
I can see it in the vows like Ivona bitch
You know who you rolling with, betta be careful who you showing shit
Just a role model with a polo nit
Come to the party on some solo shit
Leave with the dark bitch from Total
Pose for photos
Risotto made with the ink of the squid
The rims on the Lincoln spin
Eighty million on the pinky ring
Got these bitches bouncing like a slicky man
Tear faced in the winter
Flipping pancakes in the rental
This where the shit gets sentimental for me
I swear this shit is sentimental to me
Pick up the pieces of F from what the past bring
I'm still living in the fast lane
In the streets where they flash flames
Y'all, it's all about the cash man
Itâ€™s all about the cash, man

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Oh No]
They say I'm number one on the speeding bullets
Something wrong with that trigger, pull it
Another run like you're Genna Mullet
I'm on track, olimpian shit, light the torch
No fire pass, murder smoke from the front porch
I'm in my own league, like fuck a sporter
Sport that white T
I need that Gogol like I'm Ice T
It's like I'm always on the heist, G
Just tryna pill with that light B
I'm moving at light speed
Fuck that bitch if she ain't liking me
Because her best friend invited me
And she wanna ride on me
The Frankie Lymon to the Chichy Simonds
I get 'em higher than a drunkard pilot
I'm flying this inside of privates
Flying inside of privates
I tell you, I ride that pink booty like it's piracy
Here's a name and a frame, light it like diamonds
Tell a bunch of clients, run when you hear the sirens

[Hook]
