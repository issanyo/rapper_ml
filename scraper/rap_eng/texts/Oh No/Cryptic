[Verse]
I’m cryptic
You know, hard to tell when I ripping through my victim
Hit them, in and out and straight out the picture
Richter, know that I’m the highest on the scale
Chop up my enemies and pack them in a pail
Impale then I bail, won’t have you on my tail
Secretive, casual grinding on the rails
Barrel roll, low control, locomotive protocol
Death chopper, kill proper, lock and load
My foes straight up left with a tag on their toe
Hoe, remorseless. I’ll throw in a stone
No jokes and hoaxes, not even kidding
Pray and be thankful that you’re still living
Concentrate, loss of weight due to the pills I pop
Treat her like a goddess and I love it when she give me top
Cleaning up acts like a Swiffer-Sweeper mop
Here to talk but don’t be surprised when you’re shocked
