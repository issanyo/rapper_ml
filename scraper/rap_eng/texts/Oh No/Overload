Motto is the hero stepping
My people know the evil
The horrors of lethal weapon
Ay yo my nigga Oh Nizzo light up a dub
Despite of the love when we rock right in sight of the club
Let's just do the same from Oxnard to Brussels
To New York back to the bay
Wild Child, I'm down to hustle
Oh No step to the masses on my protocol prototype
Nine years later I'm like JJ yelling out Ohnomite
We tell each other that we need to uplift our childrens
Recognize this brother got game
Not just because of his older siblings
Yeah let the story by told
Cause we can bounce back and forth amongst the team
As the whole crew unfolds
Every beat's intrigued in obscured loops and bass lines
Throw you blunt up for the (?)
Cause this is that old Disrupt shit
Classic erupt shit
You know that old turn that shit up
That straight up what the fuck shit
Its time for the saga leave 'em cutthroat
Before the latest minority report begins its upload

Let the bass line ride with you
Feel it in your chest, take over (?) with you

Newest chronicle from the Disrupt chapter
