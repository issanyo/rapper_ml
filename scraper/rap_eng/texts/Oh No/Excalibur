[Verse 1]
Shifting through the desert like a sidewinder
Rhyme finder at a fine diner
Wielding Arthur’s Excalibur
Dicing my foes, you won’t know where they were
Blade blinding when I draw with it
Take me up and you’ll fall with it
Burn with the heat of thirty lit torches
Legendary swordsman, touch and it scorches
Ancient paintings are true in their art
Find me in the temple when it’s dark and I’m writing
Candles lit and you feel the aroma, circulate through your veins, put you in a coma
Burst through the dusk, use a husk to hunt for my prey
Tribal, living in a jungle, face paint
Poisonous darts fly through the air suddenly
Struck down, cold sweats, face mask, dancing
Caliburn shoots out it’s magical attributes
Slain by the stream of the God-sent fire-beam
Higher beings told us to be real cautious
Suffer from blackouts, freezing, you’re nauseous
Medievalist realist, yes ye do exist
Brisk breeze blows and it’s cease and desist
Sent to the palace and in no time, captured
Sent to the cellar and your spine gets raptured
Dispose of the corpse then bury the hatchet
Ask it and end up dead when we latch it
Blowing a gasket, melt you like plastic
Remnants set with the rest in a casket
Put a target on your head aim then I blast it
Just to find out that this is practice
Paint with a brush, make mythology come alive
Come back from time and I hit the stage live
