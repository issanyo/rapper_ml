And we gon' take y'all
All the way to heaven
This evening, okay?
So clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your hands, yeah..

[Verse 1: Declaime]
Let see now
How should I start this
Where should I begin
Somewhere in the middle
How about near the end
Better yet how about my birth
The day I came into this earth
And now my soul can down to search
And for what I don't know
Always was poor
Borrow bread from the white folks next door
Step daddy would've switch
Never taught me how to pitch a baseball
And what the hell is basketball y'all
But all at all it was all for the good
The better so hand me down that sweater
Don't wanna catch a cold
Life will get better
That's what I was told
It just kept getting old
Even though I got eyes of my own
What I've seen is how I've grown
Poet pass the weak I let it be known
I gotta get this life right
One day you're here the next you're gone
And that's your birth right here

[Hook]
All the way to heaven
Ain't no stopping us
Me you her him
In God you trust, uh
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
'Til I die I shed light
Cause that's a must [2x]

[Verse 2: Declaime]
As time goes by
In a blink of an eye
Can't seem to figure life out
No matter how hard I try
How to separate the truth from the lie
The truth let it be known
He who don't sin cast the first stone
And what is love?
This is what love is
My brothers and sisters
Fathers and mothers cousins and kins
Love was here before this world begin
So get up on your girl [?]
Before it comes to a end yeah
All my friends and foes
Love now 'fore hate grows this I know
And I guess I always knew
There's a little hate in me as well as you
But it's okay, we'll all work it out someday
We'll all be together
Cause after death it only gets better
So don't sweat the technique
That God chose
I ain't playing with what I'm saying
Only God knows

[Hook]
All the way to heaven
Ain't no stopping us
Me you her him
In God you trust
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
'Til I die I shed light
Cause that's a must [2x]

[Verse 3: Declaime]
I do a [?] thing
And this is what I bring
To one can pull my strings
Our haters close your jaws
And let me do my thing
Clear up [some pride] in minds
If you see confine
The true joy that life can bring, yeah
I know the end is near
Seeing it everywhere
In the skies the governments got alibis
And who did what and where
Look at the clothes you wear, uh
Idolizing names pumping the wrong people up
And guess his name
There's better things to do
Between me and you
I'd like this world to last
And not die out so fast
Arm to the future and outwith the past
Arm to the future and outwith the past

[Hook]
All the way to heaven
Ain't no stopping us
Me you her him
In God you trust, uh
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
'Til I die I shed light
Cause that's a must, yeah
All the way to heaven
Ain't no stopping us
