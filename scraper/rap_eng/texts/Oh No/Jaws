[Verse 1]
Eat a dick bitch this is money
This ain't Kid Cudi this is G shit, gully
Machine grip sixteen leave a mummy
The E320 scurry quick in a hurry
I'm accompanied by a bunny and comfy and not bummy
Niggas should run free and far from me
Only god can judge me
Your army is dusty, underarms musty
Stop starvin' the custys
You must be tryin' to bust me, kinda husky, touch me
I'll just be on the Rikers Island bus seat
Bust heat, nothin' sweet, suffer defeat
I'm rollin' up in the suite, hoes rubbin the feet
I'm somethin' to see, sunk in the V, sucker free son of a G
I'm everything you wanna be
Laurence Rugby's sippin' bubbly with company
Say it bluntly, I was nice when Pac danced with Humpty
But now they bump me out the country
You could never chump me you monkey your head'll be lumpy

[Hook]
Riding in the Lex with that thing on deck
Thinking about bread, getting head
Still fill a nigga with lead, enough said
I'm just a nigga from the 'Stead with a gun on the leg

[Verse 2]
Roll up a O, fold up the dough
Pardon me no need to hold up the show
Gold overcoats, Hall & Oates quotes
Maneater, blam heaters four to ocho
Try and play me for Joe Schmo
Your flow's so-so
Probably work for the po-po
Shotty burst at your Volvo
And not the ozone
The emblem on my cuban link's like a snow-cone
Blocks like clothes are sewn and it's known
Angry peasants throwing stones at the throne
These are ghetto poems
I'm a hoodlum, you a good son
I'll send you on a kush run
Pies cook some, cut niggas down with the Bush gun
Earn a good sum, and burn a bush son
Love to goosh somethin'
I'm trying to be a good Muslim
But niggas will leave you in the hood slumped
The wood on the pump was cut
About ten inches off of the front

[Hook]
Riding in the Lex with that thing on deck
Thinking about bread, getting head
Still fill a nigga with lead, enough said
I'm just a nigga from the 'Stead with a gun on his leg

Dump lead, you hot under the bed
I got fifteen in the clip, one in the head
