[Intro: Sampled]
I'd like to welcome you to Long Beach, CA
The time is 7:35 am, we'll be taxi'd for a few minutes
So please remain seated with the seatbelt securely fastened  and baggage stowed until the gate and the captain turns off  the passenger...



And just get on up. Ladies! (Ladies)
And just get on up!

[Verse 1: LMNO]
Sometimes its good to forget
And not think about the problems with the world today
See it in grey, revolving colors in the rain
Celebrate mixin up the display
Deception is perception when i pray its spelled with an A
Vindicated before the picture was painted
Wasn't overexposed thats why the image never faded
Couldn't take the weight of the world, its off scale
The grand scheme up close is just a small cell
Got ill communication better speak with ma bell?
And when she break lose better believe its all hell
The chem trails contaminating cold rails
Til I heard devils or just angels that fell
That missed the trapeze got trapped up
Diseased are the ones that won't help him back up in times of need
Every poor aspires I guess, some glands act more grand than others its the nature of the sweat
I gotta remember to forget
Off schedule, off set
Still suprised you haven't turned this off yet
Here catch a rock, let me get the assist
And help prove the theory that intelligence is bliss

[Verse 2: Oh No]
Hey, I watch em look away from the poster got they eyes stuck on television
That frail decision, i tried to tell them that's ?
Can't take the heat then get yo ass up out this hells kitchen
See i don't scent ya'll weed, I'm smellin' something different
It's ?, theres pills from it,  the bills keep runnin'
And the factories without workers homie they still function
And they frontin' in that, new era, metal made, laser engraved
Mechanical slave, robotically trained, with the arms of a crane
That lead to more criminal minds
And out of a job that grind, is take what you find
You people comin' up with more problems
See why they raise the price on the meds on me
Damn right, we sick and tired of that shit
That black market's how we get our meds quick
Smoke with me, you roll yours and ima roll mine
See, you smoke yours and ima smoke mine
Cause I ain't gotta smoke yours for me to go zombie
Just find me at the spot with no weed on me
