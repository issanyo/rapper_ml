Come on now
And set your differences back aside, draw up now
Your battle-arms and weapons up
To put the industry back
In two years flat with taxes that
Oppress the upper class


Don't put their old regime back!
Stackin' stacks on stacks
Rejectin' privilege state religion
With absolutist monar-chism

Schism splittin' back in time
With high-level leftism
Time, help our industry
But first I got a little bit of

Flack from Mr. Robert Southey
Get ya act back
In the track of prospect city --
I have to help the people deal with me

Believe in state affairs
With no drawbacks or cut affairs
Think back to king henry where
He had a lot of bad affairs

This kind of act
Just can't slide
On these slacks, made in industry
In cottages ranging from left and right to you and me

This type of work is here to stay
Whether or not some trick's at play
Just remain
Thing's will get better if you just wait

And with romantic space
Our time can't waste on group erasure...
Putting people first and states out is our tater hater

I can't keep sitting here and making bets to lie to you
You've got to expand your mind and help me revolutionize you


Come on now
And set all your alliances aside, put up now:
Your white-truce flags and mark egads
And set the industry to what it had
Progressive act has gotta push all these remarks forward

In eyes align with space and time
Keep science up and forward-sighted
Brightened by the sun-n-stars in past regards
To endless fili-bastard back in -ism
Up the rhythm
Sidney with em
Five/Eight asymmetric compound serum
Near him re-refracting taste
That's laced with venom chalk-like paste
To leave the people's minds debased
With individualistic post apocalyptic Richtic

Norms
Pushing people to their limit
In a storm
Of laid back, gilded spirits
Setting back our business
And its plat-form

We need to bring in something
Special and essential
To our proven, stable
Waybill in our haste
Until the field is level

We can't just locke it u p
Ideas need be shouted up
Into the heavens, praise above
Just ask adam, he's had enough
To put us back on nation's, wealth engraved in
Celtic fringes blasting parties
Hardly working, not so sorry
About the towns without an army


This type of action
Can put us back in
We've got no track in
But this is happenin'
