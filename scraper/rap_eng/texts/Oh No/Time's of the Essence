[Verse]
Got to sit back, relax, but really is there time for that?
World keeps spinning so I can't take all the slack
Back to back battles and I’m back to the basics
Hold up, move back, better check your placement
No time wasted, but it's impossible to, cease every moment. Just do the best you can to not explode with the constant burden that's hurdled towards you. Don’t close the curtains
That'll cost you time and time's of the essence
Limited time allotted for existence
So the key is to fight back with persistence
Inches away but you must not play with the way that it goes
You must stay consistent
War on earth is the birth of an average life
Keep on going just to push through the constant strife
My advice is...
