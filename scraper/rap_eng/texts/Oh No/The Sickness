[Oh No]
Yeah
I got that sickness, sick shit
Sick spit, my sixth sense allows me to sic shit
Incense them, intent
Killing 'em without imprints, and instinct
I'ma let them dogs bite off like Michael Vick did
Ignant, that boy Oh got flow like magma
Hot lava that grabs ya, crash in ya phantom
Melt down like plasma, residue after
Hip hop ain't dead, I'm the cure for the cancer
I'm about that raw like crack was and that does
People coming back and they act up
Fuck that, get back, homie I'm stacking my chips up
If you don't understand then sick duck
Bitch ass, run that, ay you don't want that outcome
Your outro won't be outdone
I got out, linked up with Alchemist
Ready to outgun, even if they were Sega they still couldn't outrun
The sickness

[Alchemist]
Press record, don't stop nothing
Been gone for a minute, long time no drop nothing
Back in effect, flyer than first class on a jet
Back on the set, back on the block, back on the steps
Burnin' on the ones and the twos, I'm back on the decks
Pen gripping while I'm sipping cognac with a Beck's
I'm coming out of left, don't count bars, I just rap until I run out of breath
Or till the beat goes off, I pack a party till the street close off
Cool off and let the steam blow off
Lick a shot, let the machines go off
Pull it back and rewind and let the sirens go off
I rock on any rhythm Oh say hop on
I drop bombs, speaking on the track that I'm locked on
I'm bugging out on the stage like Flav with the clocks on
Made 22, no shoes, go through with the socks on
The sickness
