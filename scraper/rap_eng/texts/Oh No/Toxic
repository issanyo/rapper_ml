[Verse 1: Prince Po]
Lethal injections in your veins
I'm a prophet
Sulfuric acid set into you brain
Is a constant
Propane poems and flames
Catastrophic
Disintegrate through the chains
With laser beam Glock spit
Performing mathematics
Transplants to broaden you range
My antioxidants is for dislodging the pain
Blow through the nose of your Bose
With nitrogen flows, pulse bang
Like a bison annihilating the game
Relieve pressure where the rest won't
Touch a hater
We cross to pull the torch
So they wet molecular structure
It's the boss
Get slept on
Teflon
Protect the delta force
Infiltrating camps
With frauds at close to no cost
Pitting the pendulum
Mutilating and bending them
Stimulating dosages
Replenishing the synonym
Only the holy remains
Across the coldest terrain
Peeling them for Benjamins
Ninjas syringing them with novocaine
Numb skulls down to their shoulder blade
Told you lames that I'm far from finished
Diminished squads when lifting bars for chemist
A premise fallen wicked
Rs in my lyrics
Trigger the sprung mystic laws of my spirit
My art of war drawn to give them the business
Musical menace blowing in like blizzard
Now come and get it

[Verse 2: Oh No]
Send an air raid over your town
I'm fitting to bomb shit
The trails like Chemtrails
No option
It's written in the thick smoke of toxin
The air waves sick thought synopsis
Forgotten
But stil pop it like oxycontin
They don't want to feel the pain
Of their body riding while they body rocking
So they sleeping and they do it often
Can't no body stop them
Keep dreaming
Like heroine injected to they ear canal
Fitting the only way that you can hear now is to
Slow it dowwwwwnnnn
And tell them that my musics like ecstasy
And tell that my shit is like the sound by the leprosy
Damaging nerves when they next to me
I'm cooking up the recipes
Like ricin, like ain't' no body check for deezus
That's the Heisenberg, lab in the cleaners
Better not telepath with some cleavage
Bar shots have them all leaning
The doc strap them in none leaving
Fumigate ain't' no body breathing
Send the troops, tell them get even
My pen broke, ink still leaking
Face demented like I pushed your cheek in
Brain damage, hell was you thinking
The chemicals are peaking
Homie I'm toxic
