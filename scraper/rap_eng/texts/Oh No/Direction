Oh No

You know what I’m lacking?

[Verse]
Direction
Headed to the outskirts, don’t know where I’m going
Convection
The heat that I blow out when I’m breathing
Heaven
Don’t know if I’ll make it to the glowing gates
Present
Got to make it count cause the future waits
Hate is a cloud and it hovers above me
Roughly, I shit on the fakers who dug deep
Down to the ground, when I’m wound I’m around
Just know it
Traveling farther, I owe it
To people who have stuck around through the acts of a clown
Squint and the sign reads “get out of town!”
Skid marks left from my whacked out driving
Even though I’m down just know that I’m thriving
But I can’t say things with certainty
Pound on the ground til my face turns burgundy
Directionless mess, lead me straight into a brick wall
This y’all is what really happens when you trip, fall
Off of a cliff but I’m not losing anything
Begging for a penny and I’m loving what the Henny bring
Many things in my way but I must have my say
Praying for the day that it will all pay
Off
