[Verse 1: Homeboy Sandman]
Ay yo, the concrete labyrinth is keepin' me captive, hyperactive
I saunter through the cold city, no goals for the progeny, approaching me
All types of ghosts play me all types of close, I wish that I could light some bulbs
Rollin' on my own like the Elm Street tricyle, my eyes are soaked
Their eyes are stoned, this is ground zero, I woke up twenty hours ago
I walk amongst the thousands, that's always left with miles to go, from hovering around limbo
These browns are broke, and tired of browsing bro
I barely got the powers to cope
It's hard to stomach when it grumbles and it growls are both
It sound nothing like Al Jarreau

[Hook: Homeboy Sandman]
But there's a heaven too x2

[Verse 2: Homeboy Sandman]
Ay yo, the iron horse weary
Influencing how its passengers think
Can lead em to water but can't make em drink
It get under your skin, make-up, ink
Ain't no lookin' back, what they lookin' at? Make 'em blink
The rise of machines, over hombres, chewing bacon, egg and cheese
Just yesterday I learned ABCs, my aching knees
My age increase, I spray Raid and sweep
The carcases away, as officers do raids and sweeps
They say that we were kings and queens
Remind me of the crazy queef
Sheesh
Blowin' hot air, I wonder if it's not fair, it's always not fair
Whenever someone's not there, they only downstairs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Oh No]
Drawn out without a stencil
My thoughts shape the canvas like a pencil
My art is something simple
Lost in the mental
A big body of work, nothing simple
We build pyramids but they keep raiding the temples
I find myself at the cross lifted in the middle
Instrumental
Tryna crack the codes, but it's all riddles
You speak of nizzle, get your body riddled sentimental (mm)
That's how we send a memo, no subliminals
Spots shut down, they closing they doors
Rarely open, forcing the wars (c'mon)
And it's poor economics keep us dirty, fuck doin' them chores
I'm just a made man, I'm not a maid sweepin' the floors
What we made was a foundation to creep through the walls
I used to sneak in the store, stash the heat in the drawers
That was before the tours, just dealing with my hellish moods
Sometimes it's hard to see that there's a heaven too
