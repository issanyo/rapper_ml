[Intro: Dolemite]
Watch out- How much you pay to come in here? Three Dollars?

[Verse 1: DOOM]
Front row of the cat fight
The cash tight, write it up flash light, last night
Was a ball, lost a eye off the fly y'all
Bloody tab, he fell head first off the dry wall
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing
It's like the quickening, quit your sickening bickering
Things kickin' in, the wick is flickerin'
It's super mother frickin' villain, witchin' through thick and thin
Oh no, the beat is like go go in buffet
Except there ain't no pork and the beans up in the buffet
He ain't lyin', wreck confessions as a rag bite
Sent it as a beamed text message off the satellite
Reflect it like SolarBright
When he hold the mic, he run the mic like Dolemite
It don't match what the decor
But duty stay in drawers, give a round of applause for Rudy Ray Moore

[Verse 2: Oh No]
Smell the piss on the restroom floor
No doors, whores testing the course
Need more three dollars on the tab with the cash
Easy stash, show off the ass get past faster than the avalanche
Hoes know this is quotable
Club thugs filling up the show trying to overdose
And the bouncers are haters
They act tight, and these drunk ass niggas always trying to fist fight
Ain't no wrong, tell 'em (that's right)
Blow more smoke than a motorbike's tailpipe
Seen the villain chillin', had to pay a visit
Super human shit, raise the ceilin' while I raise a million
While I'm in the buildin' bitches sittin' catching mixin' feelings
Like a bad case of intervention, straight ventin'
Cat fight still appealin' to my innervision
Trying to mack in the back during that intermission
