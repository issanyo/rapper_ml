[Verse 1]
Don't come close
I don't want you to see my face, my face
You go away; I work so hard
I don't have time to start all over
I'd like to be

[Bridge 1]
Leave you without feeling bad
And leave you with the knowledge that

[Chorus]
Most, most people would release you
Most, most people don't change; they only get old
So, if I let you back in close
Will you hurt me?

[Verse 2]
In all your life
You'll never live down what you can't forget, so forget it
Flick it away then our time flies
Bringing disease to the surface
Ouch I must be sharper than your average man
Tell me honey what's the plan?

[Chorus]
Most, most people would release you
Most, most people don't change; they only get old
So, if I let you back in close
Will you hurt me?

[Bridge 2]
Don't come close, she said
I'd never stoop so low

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna need some telling me you want me
I can't hear you so take some time to think about it
Most, most, people would release you
(I'm gonna need some telling me you want me)
Most, most people don't change; they only get old
(I can't hear you so take some time to think about it)
So, if i let you back in close
(I'm gonna need some telling me you want me)
Will you hurt me?
(I can't hear you so take some time to think about it)
