[Verse]
Listen, I’ll give you advice and I promise to you
That I will be there for the next time you choose
To get off your chest what has happened to you
I’m telling you I’ve been there too and it hurts
Nightmares are walking about on this earth
Even in broad day they seem to lurk
Keep your head up and continue to work
It will all pay off one day I suppose
Just learn to keep up that confident pose
And hope to the Gods that you will not close, badly
Hitting a note but it sounds so sadly, given
Man of the rhythm, but slowly I wither away
Sit and I laze but I’ve had better days
Molten iron and hot rivets combine
To break down my spine at a fast rate, I
Count down my days but I’m not sure when
The date is that I go so I just pretend
That I’m all good, put a fake smile on my face
I’m a disgrace moving at a slow pace
The taste is evil within and it’s bitter
Back in the backyard, hit my one hitter
Stroll in the night with the candle lampposts
Physically here but I feel like a ghost
Feel like the host and my brain is the parasite
Paradise far from the spot where I currently stand
Man, so many chances I’ve wasted
Maybe next time I will actually make it
