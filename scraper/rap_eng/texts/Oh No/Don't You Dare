Ok
Ayo
Oh No
Don’t you dare

Errordesoul
Jordan X bro

[Verse]
Hey, Don’t you dare
Come here with the bullshit, yeah
I don’t really care, if you want to start conflict, bruh
Just know where you at, then I’ll start giving you props
Still don’t give fuck and I won’t until all shit stops
You know what you did, now face the consequences
Really are you that scared? I saw you hop all fences
Just know that it’s true, that I sure do come with it
This song is the one that I don’t give a fuck what I say yo
I ain’t claiming shit, like some of these kids do
And it tears me to bits, that no one can come through
With the way that it is
I’m about to give up with this
Fucking around, huh
No I don’t really think like this
And I go with the beat
To me that shit is just bliss
That shit is just bliss
