Oh, it's a setup, it's a setup, it's a setup, there's a
Oh, it's a setup, it's a setup, it's a setup, there's a

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a setup, it's a setup, it's a setup, there's a

Oh, it's a setup, it's a setup, it's a setup
(No, no, we won't—won't fall)
There's a traitor, there's a mole, it's a peacetime, overthrow down
(No, no, we won't—won't fall)
Bound to break you, get you beat
(No, no, we won't)
Won't fall, we got to get underground

Oh, setup, setup, setup (fall)
Oh, setup, setup, setup (fall)
Oh, setup, setup, setup (fall)
There's a, there's a, there's a, there's a (there's a, there's a)

Bound to break you, get you beat
Won't fall, we got to get underground
We got to get underground
