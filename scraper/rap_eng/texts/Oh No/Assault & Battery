[Verse 1]
Four-finger ring, Radio Raheem
Love, hate peppers your face, this is my reign
Fuck out here
Skip the beef, you’ll live longer vegetarian
I keep something for animals like a veterinarian
Rakaa sees them young soldiers plot and try to bury him
Want him in a box with six friends tryin’ to carry ‘him
That’s Eddie Murphy funny, lil’ homie, that’s hilarious
Must be off that Hollywood Raw, feeling delirious
Just a couple bars from the Book of Iriscience
Yo, they know the rep, they say he shine that divine glow
Feelin’ generous with the lessons, free KOs
One-to-one, war for two, like TKO
See if you can handle it, showing them what the channel is
Even roundtables get live when I’m the panelist
Zulu family, Rock Steady academy
Beat up the beat call that assault and battery

[Hook]
Beat up the beat call that assault and battery

[Verse 2]
Clash of the Titans, freedom fighter moodswings
Send the beat to Acapella dented by a moodring
Strangle mics like Gracie, [?]
I studied the sweet science too, working my angles
I pity the whack, but I vote death to biters
On the mic, b-boys on the decks of riders
So these cops’ll feel vigilante verse, the caravan of hearses
That sound clash [?] that caused a family service
They claiming that these raps I send
From the sixth commandment, so in fact I sin
I capsize them then baptize them in the same ocean
Same seven seas that I swim
Word is the sound boy died last night
Sending wreaths for sympathy, insult to injury
Bounty on my head, by the county to the fed
For a mass burial a whole sound found dead
Splatter rap, this the Acts of God on track
Mad man, mathematic, automatic attack
This is C2D Family, Dilated Academy
Beat up the beat, call that assault and battery
