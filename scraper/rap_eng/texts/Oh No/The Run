[Verse 1: Red Pill]
I took a nap at 3 PM
I need a different pace, a different speed, a different BPM
I need some friends, I need some help, I need some love
I need some ends, I need some wealth, I need a hug
I need new shoes, I need new brakes, I need the lye
I see the plot, they ain't got no plan for us, don't seem an even shy
I see the cops, the news, I see the pot, the booze
I got me a list of shit that's growing I forgot to do
But still got a job to do, a lot ot prove
Don't got a lot to lose, so now my options few
Gotta duwop the old, gotta adapt the new
Too comfortable, the safest waters feelin' toxic too
And when the world come runnin' for you
Enemies come gunnin' for you
Some adore you, some'll wanna destroy you
Do nothing for you, gotta let 'em know
Problems swear they killin' me, but I don't see a victim though

[Hook: Red Pill]
Problems swear they killin' me, but I don't see a victim though
Claim that they not feelin' me, guess that they don't get it though
Do it for my family, don't believe in livin' broke
That's all that I know, I do this shit to give 'em hope
Cause all that I am and all that I was
Is all that I'll be 'til the day that I'll leave
It's all I believe

[Verse 2: Oh No]
Yeah, I woke up 3 in the evenin'
A nigga little late, but I'm straight as long as I'm breathin'
I need a reason, and I'm eager to keep believin'
Still a heathen between heaven's angels and hellish demons
I need to see that the scene achieve their meanin'
And I mean it, livin' life like a dream the same way I seen it
It's so intriguing', yeah, we in a dry season in a tryin' region
Most gang bangers and drum teachers
But we doin' for more than the plate, I'm just settin' the future
Plant the seeds to goin' away before it's fuck like sutra
Callin' it karma cause everything be comin' back
Better have armor and a shield for all the skills you lack
I got the pills, fuck the pills, the pills gon' kill me, black
Cause ain't nothin' mild, damn it, this life is wild
I'm used to livin' foul, just like a liquor store
Problems swear they killin' me, but ain't no victims, yo, you know?
