Yeah, uh yeah, I'm from the W.E.S.T., from fitted to 2xd
White shoes to the cholo crease
Heart beat to the OX (nard) street, CA all day and ain't been home in weeks
I walk stand speak swag to the weed I cheef
Flight land and I kiss the street
Freak get attracted, she need that outlet
Plus I'm the closest to Cali she gon' get
You can purchase half crack and meth tablets
Seen more glass than Windex
You can see more ass than sunset
Post in the hood on the porch step
MoÃ«t spilled for the gone I forget
This shit real from the hills to the projects
Yeah, been around the world but and all have fun
But the best place under the sun is where I'm from

You know where I'm from
We keeps it poppin, from Daygo (Diego) to Stockton
We walk on that talkin, you know where I'm from
We get it jumpin, always into something
From Oakland to Compton, you know where I'm from

I land in ATL, with tail got bumper like H3
Southern comfort break from the Hennessy
A moon shine two dimes out in Tennessee
The next flight to Brazil for the night life
Beach front two caipirinhas with crushed ice
New York I'm good with 3 dice
Flip a four-course meal from a G slice
Wrong ain't mean right, in the go get dope, can't lose like a rat in a cheese fight
G strings, designer jeans, baby be more late night fries and wings
Mad on the strip like clips from a wild scene
My music in the hood like... feet
Been overseas with love but the place under the sun is where I'm from

You know where I'm from, we keeps it poppin
From Daygo to Stockton
We walk all that talkin
You know where I'm from
We get it jumpin always into something
From Oakland to Compton, you know where I'm from

Throw my W up with pride, from Sac-town to Riverside
Pour some liquors for my niggas that died
You know where I'm from
We be cruising down city block, music banging out the speaker box
From the LBC to the OX (nard), you know where I'm from
We keeps it poppin' from Daygo to Stockton
We walk all that talkin, you know where I'm from
We get it jumpin', always into something
From Oakland to Compton, you know where I'm from
