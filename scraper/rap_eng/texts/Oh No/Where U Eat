[Verse 1:]
This is a long story he started slipping
His wifey got caught up but did the big for him
Next homie turned on him loyalty workers
Watch these no commissary to robbery with a purpose
Met a girl name snacks with the sweetest connects
23G(s), 15 months free from the stress
Left these nine in the hole fuck the bank assignment
I seize five in a row forty thousand in the primary
Plan is game, how it was supposed to be played
Mami got a weight up fortune over the fames
See advancement comes with drive and hard love
But to dance with Karma sometimes can draw blood
She became big as R and sassy loaded with brag
D hit rock bottom, ass over his head
Feds on his heel, hits from the street
Another that end up dead shitting where he eats

[Pre-Chorus:]
Chumps ain't saying nothing  must be on something
Tired of you mother fuckers, the gesture is straight dumbing
Shit! I could smell you coming but I ain’t keeping the street
Can't stand patrons, shitting where they eat

[Chorus:]
What you on? [x8]

[Verse 2:]
Newer chick name lix met her 2006
Seem like a cool Mami, too pretty for fake foul shit
Had a crib in venice took international trips
A business called Menace, hooked up least with a six
Lix was on the grinding, a bad bitch hold her down
Got a lot a good cash push took hole when he was found
Feds dropped it in their back pockets, snitching
Even had me in the tools and chumps kept bitching
Hooks seven doing the dirt first you wouldn't loose
Crossed town to set up a deal she couldn’t refuse
Most say do what you do but there’s still rules
You still gotta know who is who, respect the most crews
But back to the snakes Silvy and the family is still in the gutter with crumbs on their plate
Greed made a scheme on the bate shitting where she eat till karma brought a plate

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
