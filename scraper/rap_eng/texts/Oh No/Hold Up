[Intro]
Hang on
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on

[Oh No]
Don’t worry I’ll be there in a minute
And there so much bullshit that I don’t wanna hear it
So we remain up in the lab doing the song
Oh No and Madlib, real as it gets
Y’all can just (hang on)
Just (hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on)
Yeah, cuz ain’t nothing if ya hang on
This is that shit that we that slang on, west coast bang-on
Cali wild niggas, sinister six
Nine-three-o-thirty-third style that Oh No was raised on
My ground lights up like Billie in Mic Jackson
At least give directions to what’s gonna happen if ya
(Hang on)
If ya (hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on)
And that’s why we move
Fuck what ya heard, no shortage

[Outro]
Who’s that swing
Welcome to the beautiful musicians’ togetherness –
Who’s that swing
All the way from California
Who’s that swing, wild out
Who’s that swing
That’s Walla, Walla, Walla
Ok, alright, ok, I know we, I know we feel good over here
Who’s that swing
