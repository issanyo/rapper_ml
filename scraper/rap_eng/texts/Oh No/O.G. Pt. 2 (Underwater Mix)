[Verse I]
It’s like I found Atlantis in the sea
Or smoke trees out in the Garden of Eve
Or flew through the sky like the wind
Or rain every time a nigga sinned
This is just a glimpse – a whim
Like flim on the ground, it’s thin look around
Pen, ink it down then read it loud
Ridin’ on some cumulous clouds
When the light strikes, you can hear the thunderous sounds (Kapow!)
Run bullet lake, awake in the wake
Axis tilt, another earthquake shake
And you can read the actions the words make
And cracks in the ground that’s some actual curbs breaking
Big Jesus with his hands held out - on top of Rio, pics with people
Bright lights shining down from the steeple
Feel the breeze so high, this feels kinda steep though (Oooo)
Tip-toe through the jungle – still ape, too late
Fucking with a crazy ass primate
I rate y’all niggas zero out of a hundred just ‘cause I’m blunted
Fucker
