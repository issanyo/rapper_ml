(Feat. Jose James, Phife Dawg)

Uh oh baby

Hey y’all ain’t nothing changed but the weather
Still on the hustle they grind for the shed up
And most od whatever until it’s all over
And when it’s gone life gets colder
May no sober it’s way too far y’all
No time to bar ..to carlo
People in their bags so they be back to cargo
Need to let it go with the stump in the ..
Take it to the hard go, take it to the ..
I lick up with money rings holding to the line
Other wise is a tell me .. do it wide to survive
Money face do ..pay the way
Do what you gotta do
Do hell the way ..in the kitchen then we celebrate
It’s all what you choose and help making rules
Now make major moves and dues dues dues

Hook:
Y’all I gotta do what I gotta do
Doing whatever to sacrifice what I believe is nothing better
Better better
I gotta do what I gotta do and doing whatever
Sacrifice what I believe is nothing better

Better coward be the person that you follow
Don’t let em take be the leader that you tomorrow
Don’t be a ..should never .. if I ..every movie make a..
Don’t let the one that you ..when is tomorrow
Don’t let homie play your .. bad every .. she..
Don’t let the .. could ever be your light
..for uncle high no I ..the style his whole life
Funny your .. that ain’t gangsta that’s wet
Don’t do drugs it ain’t crash
Don’t be ..the skirt ..
Don’t be cally the .. you know the due
Dope dope dope

[Hook:]
Oh baby, oh baby
Oh oh baby
