I Ain’t Never Scared (I Ain’t Never Dead)
I Ain’t Hiding…..I’m Riding

[ Verse 1 ]
The Doctor Say I Neva Walk Again
That’s Fucked Up That Them Niggas That Shot Me Up
They Mans And Never Talk Again, Speak Again, Breath Again
Seven Times With A 'K, And Still Here To See Another Day
Damn U Lucky Blade (Naw Dog I Ain’t Done Yet)

Jigga ‘Nem A Couple Hundred Mill In My Bank Account (Plus)

[ Verse 2 ]
The Whole Hood Will Want You (Bitches) Like My Last CD
And Just For The Record Homie I Don’t Blast In These
Shouldn’t Have Never Let Me Live Seven Shots Couldn’t Do It
Now Niggas Making Calls Like They Wasn’t Involved
Niggas Wanna Run And Hide Till The Beef Is Resolved
But Fuck That I’m Killing All Of Y’all (Ah Ha Ha)
Niggas Kind Of Got Me Feeling Like Fifty And Pac
But Difference Is I Ain’t Dead, Or Running From The Feds
Every Tear My Mama Shed, Another Thousand On Ya Head
And Show Ya Face Nigga Think I’m Playing

Icy Ass Necklace, Two Or Three Rolex’s
I’ma Make Sure The Industry Don’t Ever Forget Us
Detroit (Yeaaaaaah) That’s The City I Claim
I’m On Stage Twenty Thousand People Screaming My Name
Damn Near Died, Nine Twenty O Four
Looking At My Son’s Eyes While Im Bleeding On The Floor
So You See, Being Icewood Ain’t That Easy
Please Believe, Easy Hoes Gone See Hoes Easy
And Even With That Other Nigga, I Ain’t Saying No Names
I Was Laughing That Night Yo Little Boss Got Flamed
I Was Blowing On The Chokers Banging Sounds In The Range
Niggas Always Hating When You Worth A Lil Change
And I Ain’t A Angel I Know My Life Need Change
That’s Why Every Night I Fall To My Knees And Prayed To His Name
