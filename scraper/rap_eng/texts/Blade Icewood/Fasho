[Intro]
Yeah, though I walk alone
The shadow doubts of steps looking to come for us
But too many people come around for the same reasons
We all go down to the faces of the law
Run around scared like little... never come up
Stay broke forever

[Verse 1]
If you catch me towing weight in any city or state
'Cause my hustle will never stop like a car on bad breaks
A jar with no shake, makes it come back gravy
When you using A1, the fiends come back crazy
The blaze be quick, u need a scope and a beam
I be in O.C.J. sporting blues and gray
Get out the next day, AK your brains nigga
Saying you have to see hova, and I ain't talking 'bout jigga
Have ya boys on the block, pissed pouring out liquor
Sporting white tees with ya face all on the picture
And if you live it's guaranteed that the dot gone stitch ya
Get ya main hoe to love me, cut, soon as I hit her
You know how Blade get down, flood the city with pounds
Pushing in the Caddy drug Thirty G's on the sounds
Or spinning rims bigger then the table you eat dinner on
See I'm getting money that's the type of shit I spend it on

[Hook]
If your money right (that's fasho)
If you a boss out here (that's fasho)
Tell boys when you ride (that's fasho)
Keep a heater on your side (that's fasho)
You know my name mean money dog (uh huh)
And yeah this a throw they hands up (throw ya hands up)
Or banging this in they ride
Or rolling down the nine five

[Verse 2]
It's real life here dog, this ain't no movie
So much work when I cook up I use a jacuzzi
Silencer uzi, so I can hit you quiet but quick (shhh)
What up to my dogs locked down, rook, jesse, and rick
Dogg, I've been getting cheese since the early nineties (uh huh)
In the D it's gutta dog, even the hoes is grimey
See every second counts so my time is precious
Turn my watch into a castle and filled it with prince's
Commissary, safe code, I was up in the pod
Eighty-seven chevy, Fifty G's in my garage
And if I put my hand's on you it won't be a massage (uh uhn)
Fuck with me get smoked quicker than a weeded cigar
Should've kept ya mouth shut now look what happened
Adding up my bank damn all this from rapping
Pimp, I got old stacks I ain't touched in years
Everywhere scream my name like norman cheers (blaaaade!)
I be at the Lion's game drunk off plenty of beers
Use to be the Silverdome, now we at Ford Field
After words, hit the network with Kiahn grille
I represent the money getting, Detroit niggas for real

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've been in the studio with all types of emcees
Some from Cali, N.O., to NYC
Gangsta got cheese, still gank ya nigga
Original Chedda Boys 'cause our bank is bigger (yeah)
I don't sport ice no more, I sport frost, I'ma boss
Run that nigga, fuck what it cost
Took a little loss bounced back quicker than a dribble
Filled my crib with flat screens since my bank done tripled
Riding like I'm crippled, roll more than a wheelchair
Put niggas down harder then hits from a steel chair
And I'm in a big move, six figures a flip
And I keep low pro so the feds won't trip
Then dip to a island for a nice vacation
Got a hand clap longer then a standing ovation
Getting cheese by any means, that's my occupation
Sell dope, a little real estate and rock it on stations
Cartier watch look like a iced dog cage
Money counters with a mapper I be countin' days
Purple haze, ghanz, drow, don't smoke no bamma
Put ya ass six feet like the old Jordan Jammer
