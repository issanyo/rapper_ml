If anybody's out there listening to this broadcast of mine
Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen what's on my mind
I won’t pull any punches hold anything back
I'll tell you the way that it is
When it's all said and done I'm gonna leave you wondering
How did we do what we did?

[Verse 1: Mike]
Yo, I don't care if you're a woman or a child or man
When I'm done everybody's gonna understand
Some rappers get mad when you say they're in a band
But, not me, cause I really am
It's LP for your fucking information pal
So you can stop staring back over your shoulder now
You can't stop me mugging with that twisted brow
Concentrating on mine, you're wasting your time buddy
Erase that face, replace the frown
Look at the ground, look down, quit fucking around
Now jeez, everyone's been so tightly wound
From the minute that we became the new menace in town
Could it be that these cool, contagious
Phrases sprayed aimless, are making ya'll hate us?
Shit, you can hate 'til your face turns blue
Everyone else, let me cut up a question for you

[Verse 2: Tak]
Oh, there goes another one, better call all your people in
Bury the body quick stupid, show you where I’m coming from
Open up the cellar, to the pelican's bliss
With delicatessenal sitting 'til your skeleton splits
He sets us off now, don’t know which direction is which
We all fell, little weapons with consecutive hits
But that’ll be that, so never mind your battery pack
Cause in reality nobody gives a crappity-crap
Move over, before you get your flattery snatched
You tiny caterpillars act like you don’t have any sex
Hopping over the gums drilling holes in cavity caps
They’re full of shit to the root now, pass me that Jack
On the rocks is Tak, back on the block what?
Tapping your vest like I just happen to pop up
Trapped in a circle, and now he’s itching to box
But no way I’m ‘a stop, until I’m waiting your snot pus

[Verse 3: Ryu]
I just say what I feel I don’t care if I’m black balled
Walk up in the label start waving a hack-saw
Hit the bathroom strip naked and jack-off
This white boy’s getting more gangster than Mac Mall
I’m in the crowd I’m feeding your fans roofies
Nope, that ain't a coke it’s a Vicodin smoothie
Yeah, acting boozy a thug like fuck it
Got a champagne taste with a bud light budget
Got a little-ass dick with some [something backwards] on it
So sick I could make a fucking maggot vomit
No Shit, get the mic’s out, kick it in gear, it’s Ludacris
All I needed was some chicken and beer
You better, roll out while the coast is clear
We've been hit with thick bottles and a broken chair
Bitch please you can leave with a couple of cracked teeth
Don’t pump me for the fame
I ain't crapped for six weeks, so
