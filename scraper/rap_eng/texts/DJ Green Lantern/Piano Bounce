I know they mad because my pad is looking sort of like the MOMA
I'm into high fashion and the sweetest of aromas
The women that I'm smashing, you can't even get to show up
Enough eye-candy for a diabetic coma, the city where I from
They got a rep for being coarse so I done dealt with every real emotion
But remorse, when I quit school, it's cause I never left my dorm room
Yeah, I'm sorry mama, I ain't destined for no board room
I know it disappoint you, I know you kinda sad
You want me to be normal, you gave up all you had
I know you hate my guts cause you say I'm like my dad
Just know that I will love you cause you are all I have
Let's go, aye yo Green, hold up, hold up man, I'm not done, bring that shit back
When I was young, I wasn't baptized, now I live that fast life
And I swear to God I'm paying karma from a past life
Can't nobody act right, now I got my stacks right
And I'm learning trust the only luxury you can't buy
Everybody envy, haters, they resent me, they full of themselves
And they promises are empty, in it for the prestige
And the women that are with me, they freaky little smuts
That make a slut look like a dick tease but I'm thinking bitch please
You sleazy, I don't fuck strippers cause fucking strippers is easy
Y'all just wanna please me, I'm from a city that's riddled with their diseases
Where hate is just a measure of achievement, the product of a broken home
I'm seeing women like a drug cause I saw my daddy strung out
On that pussy till he overdosed, no intervention, ain't no Maury show
Ain't no moral code that I can crack cause when he left us
This is all I know, I lost my heritage the day I saw my parents split
Abandoning they marriage, daddy staying in the Sheridan
No speaking Spanish anymore cause it's embarrassing
To carry the tradition of a man who wouldn't carry his
I'm kinda arrogant, it's one of my defenses, relentless
With every fucking right to be pretentious, a money maker
I don't need no damn investors, self absorbed like a sponge
And plus I'm cleaning up your messes, there ain't a question of who's next in line
I ain't chasing shit, I will never be a step behind
I ain't feeling nothing, you can say that I'm desensitized
And the kid is thriving in the midst of a recession
I'm building an enterprise and killing like every rhyme
And feeling like any time I enter a city homie, I make it mine
Yeah, who the greatest in this awful game? I talk to dames
And the very next day, they doing the walk of shame
This shit is all the same, I really need a change of pace
Looking in the mirror mad cause now I see a stranger's face
We all growing but some of us need to age with grace
Cause we are showing years like watches that display the date
We vote Obama, now Obama vote to make us pay
For that health insurance that he promised during his campaign
But now them CEOs and lobbyists will sip champagne
While we pay they premiums, we dreaming of a different way, yeah
