[Intro: Westside Gunn]
Grr
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, kill or be killed, you know the motto
Jean Paul, you know the goggles
Flowers on the bottles
Don't make me catch a hommo
Fire out the nozzle
Shot eight niggas, I hit the lotto
Shot eight niggas, I hit the lotto

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, hangin' out the Tesla S
With the tight [?], ain't nobody fuck with West
I used to dump all my crack, plus I had the best
Dope money, I got obsessed, you can't connect
Make a million off the front steps, you know the rest
For my niggas didn't tell when the feds swept
Took the top off the Corvette and Jesus wept
You ain't never seen these Fear of God sweats, don't hold your breath
Uh, fiends say I got the best ever
He lit a [?] in front of [?], had the G-Wag revvin'
Pyrexes beyond measures
I seen my celly drop tears on that late night, stressin'
Push the key, line 7
In all my jewels, up in V-Live flexin'
Crossin' all my Ts, I had to go to court
24 a key, make a nigga snort
Get your shit shot off for a short
Get you stabbed goin' to yard for a pack of Newports
Like Too $hort, face draped, Louis scarf
I don't give a fuck who you are

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
Kill or be killed, you know the motto
Jean Paul, you know the goggles
Flowers on the bottles
Don't make me catch a hommo
Fire out the nozzle
Shot eight niggas, I hit the lotto
Shot eight niggas, I hit the lotto

[Verse 2: Benny]
Yo, look, uh
Saran rap the money, she fuck me 'cause I'm famous
Her brother work for us, her pops told her I was dangerous
Fuck my bitch in the hills, nigga, and I ain't talkin' fashion
I'm talkin' 'bout a mansion and a crib in Calabasas
Whippin' work 'til it melt, got me the shirt with the belt
They respect it when the bosses put the work in theyself, look
I'm from a different era, I ain't used to all this pump fakin'
They gon' front page us if they catch us in this bus station
Free my nigga Dowy G, 'cause all he got is gun cases
Word is in Clinton, he shot six niggas with one razor
Yeah, y'all got y'all jewels on, but you be scared to come places
I be in the slums, starin' back, like, "Come take it"
My plug got knocked and all I had left was one payment
But he kept it G, 'cause I ain't seen my name in one statement
Came to runnin' grams, I was number one in fam, shit
By the time we parted ways, he made a couple hundred grand
I'm a real nigga, I been Gucci, got dressed, I'm in Gucci
Crazy shit is everyday, we lit, like YFN Lucci
Every rap, you got about 20 MACs and 10 Uzis
Then why you ain't been shoot me?
Man, you niggas been groupies, let's go

[Chorus: Westside Gunn]
Kill or be killed, you know the motto
Jean Paul, you know the goggles
Flowers on the bottles
Don't make me catch a hommo
Fire out the nozzle
Shot eight niggas, I hit the lotto
Shot eight niggas, I hit the lotto
