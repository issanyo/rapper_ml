Immortal Technique and DJ Green Lantern
Third World mother fuckers!
[Immortal Technique]
I'm from where the gold and diamonds are ripped from the earth
Right next to the slave castles where the water is cursed
From where police brutality's not half as nice
It makes the hood in America look like paradise
Compared to the AIDS-infested Caribbean slum
African streets where the passport's an a American gun
From where they massacre people and try to keep it quiet
And spend the next 25 years tryin' to deny it
I'm from where they cut your hands off if you make a fist
And niggas grow coca cause the job market doesn't exist
Except slave labor modern day company store
And peace keeper's don't ever ever ever come here no more
From where the bombs that they used to drop on Vietnam
Kill us children born deformed eight months before they born
I'm from where they lost the true meaning of the Qur'an
'cause heroin is not compatible with Islam
And niggas know that, but grow that poppy seed anyway
'cause that food drop parachute does not come everyday
I'm from where people pray to the gods of their conquerors
And practically every president's a money launderer
From the only place democracy is acceptable
Is if America candidate is electable
And they might even have a black president, but he's useless
'Cause he does not control the economy stupid!

[Chorus]
Lock and load your gun, where I'm from: the Third World son
Been to many places but I'm Third World-born
Guerrillas hit and run where I'm from: the Third World son
You polluted everything, and now the Third World's gone
The waters poisoned where I'm from son: the Third World son
Seven hundred children die by the end 'this song
Revolution'll come, where I'm from: the Third World son
Constant occupation, leaves the Third World torn
[Immortal Technique]
I'm from where the catholic church is some racist shit
They helped Europe and America rape this bitch
They pray to white Spaniard Jesus, who's face is this
But never talk about the black Pope Gelasius
I'm from where soviet weapons still decide elections
Military is like the mafia: you pay for protection
Kinda like sex toys, is what the country sells
And rich white businessmen make the best clientele
I'm from where they too pussy to come film Survivor
And they murder Coca-Cola union organizers
I'm from where the justice system esta podrido
Fuck government niggas politic over perico
Rebelde conocido, enterado vivo, como otro argentino desparecido
Cause Rico laws don't apply to the CIA
And mother fuckers make sneakers for a quarter a day
I'm from where they overthrow democratic leaders
Not for the people but for the Wall Street Journal readers
From where blacks, indigenous peoples and Asians were once
Slaves of the Caucasians and it's amazing how they trained them
To be racist against themselves in a place they were raised in
And you kept us caged in
Destroyed our culture and said that you civilized us
Raped our woman and when we were born you despised us
Gentrified us, agent provocateurs divide us
And crucified every revolutionary messiah
So I'ma start a global riot
That not even your fake
Anti-communist dictators can keep quiet
Fuck your charity medicine, try to murder me
The immunizations you gave us were full of mercury
So now I see the Third World like the rap game soldier
Nationalize the industry and take it over!

[Chorus]
