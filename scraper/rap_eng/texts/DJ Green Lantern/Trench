[Hook - Ghostface Killah]

I will take my time in the bushes, right
Pay the people no mind like I'm crooked, right
Shoot a nigga on down, do him somethin' right
He on the floor, telling Scrams, "Yo, I see the light!"

[Verse 1]

In the trenches with a trench gun
Got my henchmen and your stepson
Heard you're rich, boy - cut a check, shun
It's the thirty-first, and I got to pay my rent, son
Pop a nigga's face just for ice-grillin'
Actin' hard like you're Vegeta... think twice, Krillin
Give the burners to your wife's children
And make'em shoot their step-pops 'til them tykes learn to like killin'
I make pussy-ass niggas become killers
I could turn a smart, phony nigga dumb-realer
I'll rob the key to your safe
And run off with your skinny bitch and throw some meat on her face
I'm crazy enough to slump you in a shed
Then grab your girl, and hump the bitch with pumpernickel bread
Pipe her doggy-style until I come all on her legs
And then bust her in the head with a peg and heroin eggs
What

[Hook - Ghostface Killah]

I will take my time in the bushes, right
Pay the people no mind like I'm crooked, right
Shoot a nigga on down, do him somethin' right
He on the floor, telling Scrams, "Yo, I see the light!"

[Verse 2]

You ever wanted to get rocked with a graceful hay-maker, or worse
Maybe popped in the waist with an .88 on a Thursday
Or shot in the face with an AK- on your birthday
Or oxed with a razor blade?  So WHY'RE you so thirsty?
You MUST want me to set off the bar, par'
Bust shots that let off on your ma's car
Y'all can snarl all you want
But we're some devilish pitbulls; y'all are just Saint Bernard dogs
Sh*t - you couldn't find a better villain
.44 guns and a binder full of women
I laugh at niggas trying to get a win in
Dumb-ass niggas got me doing that "Joe Biden" kind of grinnin'
Jigga's so Brooklyn, so Marcy
I'm so Bronx, I got a house in the Bronx, on Bronx Street
I'll throw you in a bag, like my laundry
Hip-hop is dead, and I'm the rapping zombie
What

[Hook - Ghostface Killah]

I will take my time in the bushes, right
Pay the people no mind like I'm crooked, right
Shoot a nigga on down, do him somethin' right
He on the floor, telling Scrams, "Yo, I see the light!"
