[Intro X4]
I'm close to the edge
Don't push me

[Verse 1: stic.man]
Yo, this recession got a nigga losing calories
Can't get no food in your stomach without that salary
Gotta come up by any means, my mentality
Don't wanna dream about it, gotta bring it to reality
On my side of town, this ain't new, this is life
If you ain't lived it then you have no idea what it's like
To go to bed with excruciating pain in your abdomen
So hungry you can't sleep, you just lay awake imagining
Big dreams, big schemes, big risk takin'
Penitentiary waiting for me if I'm mistaken
Paying dues, can't lose, failure's not an option
The only way is up when your coming from the bottom
Tired of watching all these companies get bailed out
And the only thing that poor people get is another jail house
That's why ain't nothing patriotic in me
For they system my heart is empty

[Hook: stic.man]
Don't hate my grind
We gotta make a way
Though things is getting tougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate my grind
We gotta find a way
Though things is getting rougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate...

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Another day up in this servant concrete village
Trying to live in a world where they just rob and pillage
I'm waking up in the clothes that I west to sleep in
I pick up my pistol and I get back out on the creep
And I see the same bullshit I just saw the day befo'
Drugs and the murders and my people trying to play me yo
I ain't about that bullshit and they already know it
I don't want to have to kill but still I can't show it
So I mean mug them, screw face them, and I twist up
Hand on my strap while I'm balling my other fist up
Pass me the piff and roll me another spliff up
Cause one way or another my nigga I'm finsta lift up
Above the troubles and the stress and the mess
I'm just hoping that the good Lord is choosing me to bless
I'm tired of this world trying to fuck me like a pussy
My nigga I'm close to the edge don't push me

[Hook]
Don't hate my grind
We gotta make a way
Though things is getting tougher everyday
Where there's a hustle there's a way
Don't hate...

[Verse 3: M1]
Ain't no retirement from this profession
Plan B is the Smith & Wesson
It's reliable
No 401k for this runaway slave
Fuck tomorrow when we hungry today
But you don't here me though
We be surviving off of Cheerios and videos
We get a dose of the high-fructose and there we go
A recipe for the grind, AKA the struggle
AKA the muscle, AKA the hustle
It's hard enough for us to trust one another
When I see you as a threat, not my sister or my brother
I hope one day we put this all behind us
And resurrect the grind museum for memories to remind us

[Hook]

[Verse 4: stic.man]
I feel like Melle Mel on "The Message"
I'm close to the edge don't push me
I'm trying to hold my head but its hard out here for a pimp man
The cemetery's waiting for you if you slip man
Another day of oppression
They call it possession, it's media misdirection
But you know what get's greeted by repression?
A long overdue, much needed insurrection
It's a cold world, but I'm a grown man
And a grown man needs power in his own hands
Ain't no sitting around, waitin' complainin'
Unless your in love with the plantation

[Hook]
