[Intro: Westside Gunn]
Drrttt
Boom boom boom boom boom!
Ayo!
(Ayo, Hitler on Steroids)

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo
It's the zebra V2 rocker, guess who?
Mister completely in a Lexus coupe (skrrrrrrrrrr)
Hundred round drum, more fire
I keep it on my jit, he got no priors
God bless the niggas doing twenty over crack sales
Human Made hoodie, jacket pastel
Push a gold plated 'Rari
A thousand bricks cracked the last scale
Servin' all nights, fiends up
Three days no sleep, I gotta re-up
KAWS painting hanging over the bake stove (bake stove), bake stove (bake stove)
Jewelry hang glisten
Leave your brains missin'
CVA whippin'
Nigga face twitchin'
Bag of Ace fishin'
Bucket hat flippin'
Running through the bricks
Like Usain in that kitchen
Insane when I'm dealin'
Hand to hand killin'
Went to sleep, drink a million bricks
Woke up like God willin'
Real nigga shit
Shady just dropped off the bag
Now I'm 'bout to go flip the shit
Tell papi I'll be right back

[Refrain: Westside Gunn]
Took the ones to cop the island
Took the ones to cop the island
Took the ones to cop the island
Took the ones to cop the island

[Bridge: Royce Da 5'9"]
One hundred thousand machine guns get found in a row
Come to your town, fuck ya fee hoe
Knock 'em down in a row
Sniffin' cocaine off the table and the line in a row
One hundred thousand machine guns found in a row

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9"]
Look
I don't ask shit, I just spaz
Ski mask on in the Aston
Headed to Bible class
As the water in the streets splash, it's the fiberglass
I classify your last album as weakass cyber trash
I've amassed so many bodies I keep bags by the bags
Right or wrong I'm willing to live or die by the song
Tattoos of my newborn son on my right arm by the psalm
I'm legendary like Iverson
Counting cash, splitting the pie with none
Never will I divide the sum
I'mma just be forever living or die by the gun
Uh, black and white tuxedo
Tuck ego, regal Billy Dee though
Touch cheese, so cerebral skeezes be like "fuck me, fuck me mo'"
Uh
Prayers up, fuck evil
Either we in a players' club or a cathedral
Up underneath a gazebo, clutch squeeze blow, but
Allow us to begin
That's right I'm just gettin' started
I got sluts and they lined up for the win
I'mma be 'round here forever and the only thing falling off is my nut from her chin
Thinking is a nigga time up, then, when?
As I go to lift the blinds up at the wind
Woo
They call a nigga wrecking ball Nickel
No shark swimminâ€™ or dentist'll check a jaw quicker
Product of my mama and papa upper dresser drawer wisdom
If there's a check involved I disconnect from flaw and then I connect to raw business
Uh, if there's an upper echelon, then every echelon should know I'm in this
The airhole on a barrel make the TECs so extra long-winded

[Refrain: Westside Gunn]
Took the ones to cop the island
Took the ones to cop the island
Took the ones to cop the island
Took the ones to cop the island

[Bridge: Royce Da 5'9"]
One hundred thousand machine guns get found in a row
Come to your town, fuck ya fee hoe
Knock 'em down in a row
Sniffin' cocaine off the table and the line in a row
One hundred thousand machine guns found in a row

[Verse 3: Conway]
I pop the sticks, see fire comin' out the chopper pipe
These other niggas rappin' but they not as nice
Whippin' rock, the white, flood the watch with ice
My dog just got some more blocks and plus he drop the price
Cop killas' and them clips, them shits'll stop ya life
Fuck all these niggas, my gun work, and plus, I can fight
Hey you shot tonight, I was broke but now my pockets right
Drink is pain, my bitch don't drink pain, she like Ciroc and Sprite, aight?
I'm a legend, you missin' the point
Ride through the hood with a stick in the Royce
I'm good when I visit Detroit, I pull up and kick it with Royce
Triple just hit me and said he got hoes, I can get any bitch of my choice
Nigga shot me and twisted my face, but it ain't do shit to my voice
These niggas can't fuck with the flow at all
You know my protocol
The grimy shit? I'm the one you know to call
Hit your head with this MAC 'til I blow it all
Real life what he sold us all, yeah
Real life how I got the city on my shoulders
