[Verse 1]
My reputation's paramount
Otherwise, air 'em out
Shoot it in hurr, airin' out
Let 'er know I'm headin' out
Conduct my booth business then go back to the lab and wear it out
Cut the pie in two ways
Other half, bail me out
Hear me out, doin' better things
Big cars, heavy chains
Funny what the cheddar brings
Breezin' through the hurricane
Bust through by any means
Squeeze on my enemies
Then skate to the Philippines and watch out for this Guillotine
Jump ship, they spillin' beans
UFOs can affect the cream
Unknowns in drug zones
Everything ain't what it seems
Cutthroats smell gun smoke
Kill you off with one stroke
Zip-lock, quart of coke
Watch out, her water broke
Lord knows how far I'll go
Press hard, charcoal
Black diamond, Frankie Lymon
In a trap, with top ramen
On the charts you see me climbin'
Bars and a beat with perfect timin'
Poke more holes in Puerto Ricans
On the upper tier, I see you leakin'

[Chorus]
Thugs in the place with the
These women in my face with the
The thing on my waist is the
Up in the place, pour ace
(It's the joint)

[Verse 2]
The flashdance in her fancy pants
Breeze through and I catch a glance
Coverin' holes, you lookin' bland
Rough flows, for the fans
In the street you hear, "Blam blam"
Hard shit you can't Shazam
Sun tan in my Raybans
Barbecue that wasteland
Train hard with that waistband
I might make you my wingman
Introduce you to that gangland
Wolf niggas, caveman
El Hawk with the wingspan
I'm a yanks fan
High up in the grandstand
With Horace live from Kingston
Fuck them niggas I can't stand that flimflam
Shakedown for that contraband
Walk tall, you conscious man
Enemy of the state
You call it home, I call it foreign land
I'm goin' bonkers, man
Jumped out that Tonka truck
Wage war, that cop get plucked
That's the one that got me stuck
Boys on the force are so corrupt
Don't fuck with my fam, I'll spill them guts
Pull that thing from under the rug
Crash through your door
[?] bust
What nigga, I ain't got no drugs
What nigga, I ain't got no drugs!

[Chorus]
Thugs in the place with the
These women in my face with the
The thing on my waist is the
Up in the place, pour ace
(It's the joint)

[Chorus]
Thugs in the place with the
These women in my face with the
The thing on my waist is the
Up in the place, pour ace
(It's the joint)
