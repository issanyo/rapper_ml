[Spoken: Jadakiss]
The mothafuckin’ champ!
I want all three belts, too
I don’t want no crown, I want all the belts, nigga
I’m the champ, not the king
I’m the king but I’m the champ
I don’t wanna be the king, I’m the champ
I got all three belts, undisputed
By any means
Nigga bigger and stronger than me, I’m coming in the ring with the Thompson
Ah-ha!!
Y’all niggas is over!
