[Intro]
Statik Selektah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta to say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that would be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye
I used to love Kanye
I used to love Kany...

[Interlude: Sample]
You know, one time things got so bad
Until I had to go to one of my friends and talk to him
And I told him, you know

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta to say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes

[Hook: Kanye West]
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye (straight from the go, chop up the soul)
I used to love Kanye (the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye)
I used to love Kanye, (straight from the go, chop up the soul)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that would be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

[Outro: Kanye West & Samples]
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love ya
I love ya
I love, you
