[Hook: Nas (Curtis Mayfield)]
("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it

[Verse 1: Nas]
Ugh, felonious, Thelonious Monk melodic
Monster Cody OG, hard as the Ramparts police
Warring like the Answars and Sunni
I never pull my pants up, sagging my Gucci, and what?
I give a fuck who you bidded with, or where you cop coke
The bitch you with or the reason you not broke ("Rappers!")
I don't count your money, don't want none of your smoke
I don't feel your pain, I ain't none of your folk
("Niggas!")It's easy to put a gun in your throat
But I ain't on that, trying to sip Coladas where it's warm at
Cognac, crushed ice, y'all know how it is
Elijah said a women half your age plus seven years
Is a plus way to live, this is for the blunted
For the niggas who keep it one hundred
Who hunted by DAs and judges ("Green Lantern!")
This is for the drunkards, stuck in the ghetto, for winos
And old ladies with high sugar levels
Who am I? I'm here to murder the devil
I survive through the struggle and perils, I'm thorough ("Nas!")
Who am I? I'm here to murder the devil
I survive through the struggle and perils, I'm thorough

[Hook: Nas (Curtis Mayfield)]
("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Niggas!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it
("Rappers!") If they call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, tell 'em Nas made you do it

[Outro: MC Ren Sample]
"Why do I call myself a nigga, you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me!"

[Interlude: Sample Collage]
"This is once again proof that no routine police stop is actually routine. We saw that last week, of course, in Brooklyn, with the tragedy over there, and then again last night, another police shooting."

"Here's what they think about you!"

"I hate motherfuckers like you. You niggas ain't shit! Think you tough, huh? I could blow your head off with the Smith and Wesson and you couldn't do shit! How you feel now?"
