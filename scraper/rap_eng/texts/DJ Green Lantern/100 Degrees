[Mike Shinoda]
Yo, you ready do this? ( do that, do that, do that !) Ok
Come on! Let's go!

[Green Lantern]
This is an invasion
Evil genius Green Lantern
Mike Shinoda

[Mike Shinoda]
Ladies and gentlemen
I would like to welcome you to a Fort Minor event
The countdown has begun
The Rising Tied is almost here
But for now...

[Green Lantern]
Come on, Mike! Come on, Mike !

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, let's get it going in front of every man, anybody
You gotta be ready, it's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologize or even think of saying sorry
This is the way we rock steady over everybody #scratch#
Yo, let's get it going in front of every man, anybody
You gotta be ready, it's heavy when we get it rowdy
We won't apologize or even think of saying sorry
You probably shocked, probably ready to stop this already
You probably can't hang with the way we attack it so steady
We let it rock the Rover, bang the Benz, shake the Chevy
'Til everybody feels it in the chest, say it with me

[Hook]
This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees so
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Wait a second, you know the program, this is not a slow jam
This is not a love song, unless you love tearing shit down
Take a look around, you're not running this
The bluff in your nothing will hit you like a ton of bricks
Hit you together with pressure you can never stand
The softest leather just a featherweight, never man
We're not your competitors setting you straight
You never compete, forget it, it's already too late, go!

[Hook]
This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees so
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Yo, if you don't see, I'm a make you see this
If you don't roll, I'm a make you believe it
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
Shh, give me a second, I'm collecting my thoughts
And setting plots....
All right y'all ready or not?!
I've listened and watched and waited for an opening spot
And now that I got it, nobody can pay me to stop
I'm sick of that same thing I've been forced to hear
Over and over again, let me make this clear
If anybody pretends that we're nothing to fear
I solemnly swear it's over, you can tell 'em we're here

[Hook]
This is the time so just follow me
It's already heated to 100 degrees so
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Yo, if you don't see, I'm a make you see this
If you don't roll, I'm a make you believe it
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up

Everybody owes, everybody pays
Because...
