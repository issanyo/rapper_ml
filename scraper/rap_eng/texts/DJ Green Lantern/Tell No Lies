[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Looking at the trouble I’m facing
Facing the crowd while I’m staying on the stage
And the stages I go through in this game are outrageous
And the rules ain’t fair but still, I play it
And at the rate that I’m racing, it’s amazing I ain’t fading
The sun turned me from a grape to a raisin
And folks telling me I made it, please, I ain’t made shit
The soul still need saving and ever since I got up in this game
I’ve been saying to myself one day I'mma change it
‘Cause the clothes and the hoes got you chasing
Ice in the road got you locked up in cages
Keep on the American dream, one day, they’ll gonna barely be sleeping
And it ain’t your fault ‘cause you can barely see it
Stay tuned and I'mma take you to see it

[Hook: Leo]
I know someday, I’m gonna find it all
But I won’t apologize, I won’t tell no lies
Don’t go, someday I’m gonna need you
But I won’t apologize, oh no, tell no lies, oh no

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
Say that nothing worth having is easy and nothing that I worked hard for
That it’d make me want more, I ain’t satisfied, even on the top floor
I’m addicted to living a life that I can’t afford
Working in the store with clothes that I can’t fold it in
Opening and closing it, hoping to get it over with it
And every morning, my shawty waking hung-over which is funny
‘Cause this champagne lifestyle is sobering
I know the rent a little late, I’m hyperventilating
And waiting for the day that I penetrate like a virgin, working it patiently for a taste
When they looking in your wallet, they don’t look you in the face
I’m broken shit, the walls have been closing in
So much that I ain’t notice eviction notices
I’m lying to my friends, I told them my phone is dead
Trying to hold my head, but knowing I’m gonna win

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Emilio Rojas]
Another phone call to my mother looking for help
So she don’t even respond, I only think to myself
Manager paid my rent, my money been looking stealth
But on the outside, it’s looking like something else
So I can’t back track or fall in line
And I’m way passed out for too much time
And I ain’t a cat that can act all fine
Fuck the game, Kat Stacks, I’m cats, all lie
Labels wanna monopoly and the rest that is shopping me
So they copy me, sold my intellectual property
I gotta breathe, I’m worried I’m losing steam
I gotta sleep, I’m worried I’ll lose the dream
So what’s the next move? To seek the successful?
It’s something I’ll be taking to grave like my best suit
The clothes only make the man if they dress you
I’ll be copped down if I’d let you

[Hook]
