Blat! Blat! Stick'm! I, I stick'm
Blat! Blat! Stick'm! I, I stick'm

[Verse 1]
Ah, okay, let me get it, yeah, let me get it
I take work and push that like Calistetic
Stuck to the money, man, money magnetic
Lend me some drama, motherfucker, I set it
Off, yeah, little nigga pop off
SD stain your shirt with hot sauce (Ahh!)
Lifting your chain is light work
Paying me to style with my nice worth
Beast of the East, but they know me on the West
Yeah, I green like fools till it's note like ref
Mash out, $1.50 on the freeway
Feet to the floor, CK on the drawer
BK boss invasion on the fault (What else?)
For fif be waving at the law (What else?)
What it be like homie King Arthur
Eight, nines, twists, housewives, Steve Parker
Beef come, I beat drums; T Barker
Never take what they offer, I want it all
Arm and Hammer, hold the hammer in my arm
Bandana in my palm, with a Compton charm
Pray for the drama, I got groups on the phone
When they turn heat on, you ring the, uh, law
Now feel free to push the motherfucking panic button, bitch!

[Hook]
Blat! Blat! Stick'm! I, I stick'm
Blat! Blat! Stick'm! I, I stick'm
