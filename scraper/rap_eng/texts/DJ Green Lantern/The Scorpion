[Intro]
Yeah (brrrrrrrr!!!)
Uhh (it's go time Green Lantern)
Uhh (you know what's up nigga)
Uhh, uhh, uhh

[Verse]
Look, lately I been feelin' more than cocky
None of y'all can stop me
Uh, the Audemar's rocky, Titi Boi Versaces (woo!)
I'm that nigga, you oughta watch me
Get my young broad to top me
Take her to Benihana's for hibachi (hahaha!)
'member I called Big (?) told him to quarter block me
Now it's ten blocks or better when I call up papi
Marketin' genius, watch all these other artists copy
Niggas ain't heard one record and still bought a copy (HAH!)
Sold out in less than a whole hour
By the time I finish watchin' the last episode of Power (hahaha!)
Out in L.A., I'm still connected with the sour
At the Beverly hotel with somethin' sexy in the shower, woo! (talk to 'em!)
This life is a gamble, I'ma shake it, throw the dice
Can't have success if you don't take the risk and roll the dice
That's why my wrist is Rollie ice (woo!)
Hah, got the drop on the opps, we 'bout to roll tonight (brrrrrrrr!!)
Just enjoy the show, boy I'm on my shit
Don't need no features, I don't like when niggas on my shit
(I don't like that shit!)
Might see me by myself, but trust me somethin' on my hip (huh)
What's on my wrist, keep the bottle girls on my dick (what up baby?)
Fresh off the boat, you can see the stamp on my brick
Hah, Virgil himself wrote on my kicks (woooooooo!!!)
Nothin' but killers and drug dealers on my strip (BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!!)
Bodies 'bout to drop, and bitch you on my list
(You know what's up nigga) Machine
