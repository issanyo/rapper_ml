[verse 1: Jon Connor]
Tell me who in the same league
Flow infectious like gangrene
Me against the world no one even play for the same team
Get the fuck out, homie this is the dugout
I make hits and touch bases with people soon as i come out
Oasis of greatness the flow that a never run out
Loud bark with no bite get left with your tongue out
We heavy in the game at this point we talking tons now
I am hip hop like i was living in Runs House
The Michigan native that never listened to haters
I guess I'm just old school where being real is whats major
Get love from the city and legends call me the mayor
A hater trying to compare, oh my god you don't stand a prayer
A lot of niggas don't pay homage but they should
I make 'em think everybody in Flint is this good
Nas told me don't be concerned with none of this rap niggas
Cause when they dissing you back home just means you that nigga

[verse 2: Mickey Wallace]
Brain storming it's raining
Reigning I lord over many
See me you see him who's in me, we implore you to hear me
Lightning like clash of the titans
Fighting I fend off these fiendish foes
Opposing the vision not even knowing they chose
To be my victims
Sick em, I GETEM see they exposed
That precalculus helps me to polar coordinate my blows
Brimstone and fire they feel it, the realist say I'm the realist
David Dunn I'm unbreakable ain't no price on my business
With me then ride to the finish, timid then bail out the window
Should've counted the cost of what you was dying to get into
See I'm more vivid than 3d, this CD should've been DVD
I chasten with passion, like i'm fathering Stevie
Now the new fad is to be me, or either beat me they hoping
To find a kink in my amour looking for gaps to be open
Want to spear me but fear me, yeah i know what you plotting
Calling me homie but phony expressions cover your noggin
And yeah I'm waiting and watching gazing I see through the eye
When it's my time my grind will finalize in my rhyme
Till then I'm Pac to the youngins that got ambition to fly
Hell im a Wallace so obviously I'm ready to die
GETEM

[verse 3: Jon Connor]
This one goes to the industry insiders
Who don't know that i make empires when I'm inspired
I run shit they hoping i gets tired
They know that I spit fire, they hope that it expire
Look, we in a game that's so concerned with numbers
That they ignoring the hunger that gave birth to a culture
Lazy, they just looking for shit thats easy to sell
That's why me eating todays MC is easy as hell
I take a vow like i was standing on trial
I will never throw in the towel, bravo let me take a bow
Cause y'all see my reign came under a dark cloud
The one nobody wanted to claim the industries lost child
The orphan of recording, Im feeling like I'm fortunate
They kept ignoring him when they probably should've aborted him
You competition? i can't tell
Hot like i fathered the antichrist how I'm about to raise hell

[verse 4: Mickey Wallace]
I'll put their heads on a platter
All of these rappers are gas'n
Who want to box with the Mitten?
For sure i'll bag em and tag em
Industry so commercial, I hear em bragging they swaging
Here to dismantle you vandals and mush your face in the gravel
Bet you thought that your tenure was tantamount to intangible
Got it wrapped like a mummy? bet money Mick will unravel you
Lave open the notions of all you poisonous cannibals
I came here to bury em, honesty what else can i do?
Resurrect em you say? ok, i'll give it a shot
But first i'll start with the children that all these labels forgot
Bent on pursuing a dollar leading the sheep to the slaughter
Malcom told me go harder, get in that ass like a polyp
Never get comfortable, wonderful's how i feel
Kicking gluteus maximus's don't matter if your a Mr. or Mrs
See the missions the same as when it was first given to me
Be protector of the neglected no matter who feel me
GETEM

[Hook]
