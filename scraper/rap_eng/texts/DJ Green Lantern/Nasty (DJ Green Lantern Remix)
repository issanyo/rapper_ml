[Intro: Narration + Westside Gunn]
Invasion
The number one man in the world
The Flygod himself
Let me explain something to you
In the real world, you get my way
I don't care what kind of shit you're in
I will knock your teeth back out the other side of your head
You understand that?
The Almighty
Enough about me though, nigga
Fuck these niggas man
Give a fuck about none of these nigga man
I'm about to make a blind nigga see
If you ain't fucking with me, nigga, fuck you
Ayo

[Verse]
Ayo
Kiss my rosaries (Nasty)
Face in Prada hoseries (Nasty)
Shot the first ten niggas I seen
So you know it's me
I'm in a cell reading Dutch (Nasty)
Wipe the prints off it's a must (Nasty)
'04 on the run (Nasty)
I'm Big Smalls, L, and Pun

Got your bitch open nigga (Nasty)
Hit the kitchen like Nitro (Nasty)
Leg drop the brick like Hogan nigga (Nasty)
