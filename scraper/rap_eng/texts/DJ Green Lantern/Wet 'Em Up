[Bridge]
Make it rain on 'em, let it all pour on 'em
Rah rah rah...
Get him wet, get him wet
Leave him drenched
Leave his ass soaking in blood

[Verse 1]
Ayo, it's back on, smash, holme, we getting our smash on
First nigga moves wrong he gon' get mashed on
To all the comrades and comradettes
Mi casa yu casa, like the Johnson Jets
For my niggas in the pen like Lance and M.K. and them
First nigga front, I'm laying him, spraying him
AK'ing him, shots to the cranium
Had a nigga run with them so he gon' have to lay with 'em
Big homie told me get 'em, Lizzy don't play with 'em
L.E.S on my back, hear [...] in the Smittys
We getting ignant, roll a whole 6 with me
Don't need a hundred mixtapes to get my point across
The game is ours, Joe Schmuck get lost
Crack the window, watch his demo get tossed
I'm pushing it, not like the homie Rick Ross
I'll push your motherfucking wig back, I'm a boss

[Hook]
We wet 'em up, yeah, we wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, rah rah rah...
We wet 'em up, yeah, we wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, rah rah rah...

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Ever since them Phantom doors went up they been sick
All them bitches keep my name in they mouth like dick
The colored stones and the change got 'em nauseous
Rated PG â€“ Prettiest Gangsta, I'm gorgeous
Money, machines and the fortress
I got guns bigger than Carrera Porsches
My money's up, the guns up, the fun's up
Playtime's over, get blown blown up
Leave him wet like he was swimming with clothes on
Law's on the way, but the show goes on
How many times I'ma to tell y'all the city is ours?
Forecast says rain, nigga, looks like lead showers

[Hook]
