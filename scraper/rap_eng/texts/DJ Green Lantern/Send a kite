Wild out and got too greedy nigga

Havin soups havin dreams of the boulevard

In the whip on chrome in a minute

The honeys and the thugs in it

Box to the ox until they take me out

Rather go to CO hard as a rock fuck around
Gotta do the whole bid in a box

Cuz u should be outside where the big face
Hundreds be. Just write a kite and just send a kite

And tell the niggas on the block they'll always be under me
