We Back (Invasion) Part II

The Conspiracy

[Eminem]
Cause we ain't gonna never stop, you just keep wasting your energy
On us, you should find something to do with your time (time)
And quit fuckin' with us cause we ain't fuckin' with you
And E must be fuckin' with you so much you must be gone out your mind

They say I'm a day away from my entire empire crumbling
Speak up you're mumbling, what the fuck-a you's a
Bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby
This is Shady I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away
But weeble mable weeble wobble but we don't fall down like
Jam Master Jay's two turntables, our label is just too stable
Your magazine's so motherfucking thin you using staples
To hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
And ya'll got somethin' for my ass every issue
Thank you, cause I keep runnin' out of fucking tissues
And I could diss you but God I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
But-but I guess no good news is always good good news
Moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera)
50's blowing up, this year just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady, wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
Meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home
My fuckin' mind's blown, trying to figure out how to fight my own clone
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right Ro'oh?
Wait a minute I'm rambling, back to the matter at hand
It's Green Lantern with Elvis Presley the selfish MC
Back to the ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and oh man did we, yeah me and 50
Obie, me and Twizzy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga god damn it's all a plan devised by the man
It's a conspiracy...against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits
Or ain't dope lyrically, so fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out

Shady in the place to be see, and I got what it takes to rock the mic, aiight!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
Cause your magazine's over in less than 6 months!
Haha...Shady Records, still Aftermath!
And don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking, cause we can't
We don't hear y'all
So we just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives
While you ride our dicks
