Felony possession of a firearm is a fed rap

[ad-libs]

I tried to walk away from my bad habits
But I realized they bringing me mad cabbage
I'm really nice, these niggas is mad average:
Whoever ain't a lizard or a rat is a backstabber
Trynna climb my way up out of hell on a black ladder
Get my pocket and wallet just a tad fatter
That's why they love me in the hood cuz I always told facts
You ain't really a hustler if you never sold crack
A good relationship with the fiends is forever love
Jail ain't a part of the plan and it never was
It's whatever cuz how you want it homie
When I get to clapping don't get too running on me
Time's ticking, candy paint dripping
My chick mean, plus I'm on the lean like I'm sipping
Trynna gain focus I got the game in a Full Nelson in case you ain't noticed;
Cocaine quotas stay away from promoters and McCain voters
Cuz the fame'll put a lot of weight on your shoulders
Trying to get my coupes up then I get the roof cut
Better than being in the county trying to get your suits up

Felony possession of a firearm is a Fed rap

Spend money just because, do it for the fuck of it
Drought don't affect me cuz I buy too much of it
I ain't got to sneeze for you to bless me
Test me the closest I ever get to a phantom probably SP (GHOST)

Explicit at the felony hearing i don't need trial
TEN NBA niggas on speed dial
Imma do my thing on the side in the meanwhile
I'll probably be one of the nicest until I'm senile
I need one of these new niggas don't get it mixed up
Louis Vuitton gas mask cooking the bricks up
I'ma break down wit you - just give me the big cut
Send some lil niggas through there to tighten your wig up
Brothers that's behind the wall that call the bing home
This is that grimy shit it's not a ringtone
This is for the niggas that's reeing
That appreciate a prophet whenever they see him PC him
We all in the same game just different levels
Dealing with the same hell just different devils
