[Intro X4]
I’m on the warpath

[Verse 1: stic.man]
Lady liberty dressed in drag
Silver badge
No country for old men
Renegade policeman
True evil
Oppressor of the people
Blue lethal
Psychopathic
Arm of the state
Licensed to kill
In the inner city he hunts and lurks
Blood thirst
Vampire sworn to protect the evil empire
It’s business
Mercenary, no code of honor
A blue wall of silence
His actions cause riots
Murderer, terrorist, racist, supremacist
Terrorize the residents
Intimidate the innocent
Power unlimited
Targeting the prey with the hoodie and the jewelry
He the judge, the jury and the executioner
Redneck Lucifer
The streets is on fire for all the years he been abusing us
I fiend to throw his ass off of Lakeview terrace
So I ran up in the precinct and I shot the sheriff

[Bridge 1: Ratfink]
It’s been a longtime coming
And I can’t hold out much longer
It’s been a longtime coming
And all the waiting made it stronger
It’s been a longtime coming
And it’s way too late for you now
It’s been a longtime coming
And there’s nothing you can do
I’m on the warpath

[Hook]
And I’m gonna hit you like a freight train coming
On the warpath want to hit the ground running
I’m on the warpath
I’m on the warpath
I’m on the warpath

[Verse 2: M1)
Ayo my brain fried and I’m off duty
I’m about to pull out my gun and go and shoot me a movie
You think you hardcore?
But you ain’t ready for war
When you see me coming pray for the lord
You probably just a snitch anyway
And a ditch is your grave
And the president don’t got shit to say
50 shots is nothing, it’s been 500 years
I enjoy seeing all y’all mommas in tears
As I haul your ass off to jail
Stop going to church, praying to god
You’re living in hell
And I’m the gatekeeper
My boss is the Grim Reaper
Better known as the sergeant of the pig department
And guess what’s next for the next generation
I’m about to turn the whole damn ‘hood into a slave ship
You thought that was some shit in New Orleans?
You better watch out for the global warming

[Bridge 2: Ratfink]
When you close your eyes at night
And you think you’re safe at home
You’ll never see me coming
And you wake up all alone
You made your bed baby
And I hope you’ll never sleep
I’ll be waiting for you in your dreams
If you ever get that deep
I’m on the warpath

[Hook]
