[Hook X2]
There's a price on your head, young man
There's a bullet with your name on it
See the posters on the wall?
Can't you see the posters on the wall?

[Verse 1]
All this, all this, what's the meaning of all this?
The posters on the wall and the pictures in the wallets
Call us, call us, why the hell you don't call us?
The reason should be obvious
Blood is thicker than water is
So you moved in the jungle, then got lost in it
And everything comes crumblin' in a hot minute
It's a wonderful life, with a hell of a price to pay
Pictures speak a thousand words, develop 'em right away
Slick flick, snap shots, rollin' by the crack spot
Fat wad of cash gets snatched up by the have-nots
Or have-what-evers, pass my Beretta
.38 Special, perhaps would do me better
So God bless everyone who do them thangs
Everything changed once the click-clack came
God bless everyone who do them thangs
Everything changed once the click-clack came

[Hook X2]
There's a price on your head, young man
There's a bullet with your name on it
See the posters on the wall?
Can't you see the posters on the wall?

[Verse 2]
Got your name, got your number
Came here fall, won't make it till summer
Came here to ball, but you couldn't make a bundle
That type of downfall could make a nigga humble
Niggas been gettin' got since way way back
The mob gets even till they get paid back
And some niggas say that, and some niggas don't
Some niggas play that, and some niggas won't
As you can see me gone, with some clean jeans on
Rollin' down the boulevard, with my TV's on
He hopped out the fryin' pan and into the fire
Now his ass is runnin' from that gun for hire
So God bless everyone who do them thangs
Everything changed once the click-clack came
It's God bless everyone who do them thangs
Everything changed once the click-clack came

[Hook X2]
There's a price on your head, young man
There's a bullet with your name on it
See the posters on the wall?
Can't you see the posters on the wall?
