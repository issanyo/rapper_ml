[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
Yeah yeah I keep my fitted on
Even though they've been shitting on us
That Yankee logo on that brim is why I sit it lower
The city know when the kid is blowing let's get it going
I get it showing when I'm missing court I'm like Lindsey Lohan
Don't get it twisted cause I'm living the shit that you not
This is my religion so me getting this shit is forgot
The kid is rocking got no problem with stopping a show
And I got a chick to swallow condoms like condiments though
And me and my enemies getting along and it would never be giving a bronze
Getting it on with any of the women I met in Milan
Get in the building and hitting it raw, gonna be off
And when I be getting the dividends and be living it up in the loft
Yeah I keep em swinging cause I'm bringing that feverish pitch
This ain't no League Of Their Own it's a league with the men
I am the finisher, the beef will get seen to the end
Don't believe in Jesus but believe I believe in revenge
Yeah, so who going to tell me that I lost faith?
When the kid is driven your getting hit in the cross way
Cause I done lived in a crib the size of a crawl space
And I'm doing all that it takes so fuck what y'all say

[Hook: Emilio Rojas]
And motherfuckers wanna talk
Everywhere they go it's like my name is on they jaw
It ain't nothing new yo I seen it all before
That's just what they do when they thinking they should ball
So I tell them turn me up now
Yeah they gotta turn it up, aye yo you they gotta turn me up
Yeah they gotta turn it up, aye yo they gotta turn it up loud
Yeah they gotta turn it up, aye yo you they better turn me up yeah
Uh until the crowd like aye yo everywhere I go
Women coming with us and they never let me go
The crowd wrapping round the corner for the show
Yeah listen, this is everything I know, everything I know

[Verse Two: Yelawolf]
I got my kicks in dirt snakes in the garden
Yelawolf is on the beat like an orphan
No daddy fuck him won't call him
I won't beg him but I beg your pardon man
Pardon the art of me watering down
These motherfuckers hiding I promise they oughta be found
I go find 'em make 'em come follow this quality sound
Now they following me up to the Grammy winners lounge
I just call it how I wanna live it
The carnival came to my town and I just bought the ticket
And I got them bouncing like a box of crickets
Right up in the kitchen Alabama got 'em dropping biscuits
Yeah that's the business, middle finger's up like like how ya do?
Let me translate that "Hello, fuck you."
See I meet ya and greet ya when I'm speaking through the speaker
Leave it to my cleaver I'll leave ya beat up on the pizza
Sliced up, your life's up the lights up
The knife cut you nice but I'm nicer
If you ain't sipping this whiskey that I brought ya
In hip hop then you just sipping Light Bud

[Hook]
