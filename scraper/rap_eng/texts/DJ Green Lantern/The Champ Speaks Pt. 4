[Spoken: Jadakiss & DJ Green Lantern]
Ready for war, nigga!
Talk to em, Kiss!
Ain't no stopping me this time
It never was no stopping me
But this time, it definitely ain’t no stopping me
Word!
Phone ringing…
[VROOOOOOOM]
That's how I'm coming around niggas
A-ha! Hahahaha
Tahaha
The game is like a highway
You know, and there’s a lot of lanes, about a million lanes
I been—I been at a nice pace, you know, dipping in and out
But this time, when the Kiss of Death drop
This all you gon' hear
[VROOOOOOOM]
I'm gone!
