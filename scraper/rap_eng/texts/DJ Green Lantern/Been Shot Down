He's been shot down

Malcolm

"He's been shot down to the ground"
Big
"He's been shot down"
Pac
"He's been shot down to the ground"
Huh
The realest niggas, they gone

[Verse 1]
Martin Luther laying dead on the terrace, don't nobody know who laid the hit)
[?] in the frontline [?], Everybody know the government
Hate black people, not just black, big black people, think about a hundred years back
White man talking like a boss and whipping slaves, think about it twenty years back
Burnt cross in front left by them triple K's, taking niggas, put them in a box
His angle is hang them, let them dangle, left there for the little kid to watch
In anger, let him grow to be a fucking banger, [?] it's never gon' stop
Pregnant mothers, motherfuckers get shady y'all, [?]
Slice the stomach then they watch the baby fall, Let a nigga pick a little cotton
Let a nigga get smoked, bring him home on a big bowl
Everybody I be idolizing surprisingly die, who next, Nas?
[?] look at Big and Pac
Is you really not all my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hip-hop in the form of Pac in the BM, hate a nigga when he was on top
Everybody on from [?] can see 'em, [?]
Everything a fly nigga do is hateworthy, [?] by the cops
Bullet ridden in the Michigan State jersey, let me talk about the nigga Big
Fuck revival, my nigga died in a Tahoe, [?]
What is it, the suburban, I forget, and he had to go to the store
I make daddies, I'm on that Poppa shit, [?]
Act like you know that you a fast learner, take a nigga BLA! BLA! BLA! BLA! BLA!
Top of the gat go back like Nat Turner, [?]
Oh you rap niggas, you ain't mean as this, [?]
Shooting black people with extinguishers, [?]
Everybody I ever wanted to be in my life

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We speak as one, Sean Bell is us, shoot a nigga 66 times
Keep shooting and shooting like he ain't dead enough, [?]
For example, Obama and Jesse Jackson, [?]
That's right a black man plotting on a black man, see them kind of niggas everyday
Give his whole life to that white girl, I know a nigga right around the way
Come home and give his wife a backhand, I know that it's a motherfucking shame
The truth shouldn't hurt but the truth is abuse, [?]
The white man's fault, that's our new excuse
Talking 'bout the same white man who didn't want to drink
After you nigga draw eye contact [?] right out in public
With a bill from looking at a girl that ain't even his girlfriend
Don't be looking at her, she white and you black
Eat a whole meal and give you scraps, and he finna put you in the back
The back of the bus, while my niggas clapping at us
Ha, ha, ha, The white man laughing at us
Yeah

[Hook]
