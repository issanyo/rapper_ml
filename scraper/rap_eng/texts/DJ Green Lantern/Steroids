[Intro: Prodigy sample]
I'm a fucking machine, I don't stop
I can't get sleep, I can't calm down
I'm a machine, I don't stop
This shit crazy, I'm getting all kind of dough
I'm a fucking machine, I don't stop
I can't get sleep, I can't calm down
I'm a machine, I don't stop
Yeah, we on that shit, play with your life, you get killed

[Verse]
Uhh, Jordans is Off-White
Smoking sour L's shatter in the offices of Vice
All my shit is nice, you can't ignore the shit I write
Every bar is sharp like I'm in my notebook
Carving with a knife, yikes
Prefer the MAC but the .40 will suffice
Pop 'em twice I'ma cut off the nigga lights
Went to the Gucci store and bought all the shit I like
It ain't too many niggas that go harder on the mic, right?
(Not at all)
I'm on steroids 'til niggas overdose
'Cause it's an overflow of fuck niggas I came to overthrow
My youngins aim sticks, that's how my soldiers go
I still be talking to 'em like Sonny with Calogero
(this ain't for you my nigga)
Oh, 8 bricks on Cuban
Still fuck with them niggas who got bricks really moving (talk to 'em)
I flew in my thick bitch from Houston
I still know how to whip shit and move it
Y'all just rap good, my clique really shooters
My niggas really robbing shit, my [?] really gooning
I'm getting money what I gotta lie for
The fuck is a Benz, nigga? I can buy 4
And still have a bag left to go and buy more
Neck full of ice water, peace to my guy Pure
Look at these niggas deals like
"That's what you signed for, that's all?"
I would jump off a bridge if I was y'all, uhh
I'm from the gutter where multiple bodies drop every other day
You better not put your gun away (facts)
Don't come around here boy go the other way
A stray slug'll spray, get your body shot and drug away
Public School 12's every colorway
I am that nigga, what chu want me to say?
And however it gotta be, it gotta be
Keep the 30 shot with me, rest in peace Prodigy
(You know what's up nigga)

[Outro]
Machine bitch, you know what the fuck it is
Rest in peace to my nigga Prodigy
I miss you nigga, I think about you everyday
We gon' hold this shit down nigga
We gon keep this grimy shit alive nigga
