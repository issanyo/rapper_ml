[Intro]
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom

[Verse]
Ayo, Just Don Wolverines like I play with Webber
Crossover Fieg Pippens with the leopard
Next at the microwave floor, we 'bout to chef up
Get the sales off, call me [?] and some ketchup
Scarface Supremes, [?], niggas lickin'
I flew off the pitch to hit a fiend, [?]
Cactus triple beam on it, I mean
Four-door Ferrari, money green
Got my courts, beat the feds while I'm still on tour
Baggin' up dimes, had the MAC on the floor
Chine Gun is my shepherd, loaded Desert
And for the record, I be the flyest nigga of all time
[?] and smothered my walls, more violence
Cookin yay on the gas stove, lit pilots
Raf parkas, Balenciagas makin' me look taller, ah

[Hook]
I'm off the top rope, like Finn Balor
(Y'all niggas fucking know better)
I'm off the top rope, like Finn Balor
(Ain't nobody fucking with me, Lord, you niggas know that)
I'm off the top rope, like Finn Balor
(Fuck you niggas, the fucking king of this shit, niggas)
I'm off the top rope, like Finn Balor
(I make more money off one fucking shirt than you niggas ever have in your fucking life)

[Outro]
You niggas is bums, you hear me
Let y'all niggas live, man
I doubt any of you niggas gon' live long though
You know what happen when niggas disrespect me, right?
Huh?
Look in the fucking mirror
Just look at your fucking self, you a fucking bum
Fuck you got on, nigga?
Old ass Giuseppes and shit
These niggas don’t fucking rock Giuseppes, nigga
I don’t even wanna f-
Listen man, listen man
Just do, just, just chill out, b
I got love for niggas, man
I want the best for niggas, man
But see who hiring out here, man
Get y’all some n-
Get y’all some fucking jobs or something
Rapping ain’t it, man
Niggas made a thousand fucking songs, man
Still fucking broke
I’m on tour, nigga, I’m making it-
Listen man
I gotta show tomorrow, a show the day after that
A show a day after that, a show the day after that
And a show the day after that, motherfucker
Hitler 5, nigga
