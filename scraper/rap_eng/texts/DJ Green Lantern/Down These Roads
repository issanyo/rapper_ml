[Intro 1]
Everybody wanna be a beast
Until it's time to do what beasts do

[Intro 2]
They can put the trashman on the stand when I'm fighting the charges
I don't care, I'll still put your life in the garbage
And I'ma still be righteous regardless
That door that you opening up to friends and fans is likely revolving
They don't always like to see you evolving
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Come on down these roads
Where shit can get real thick real quick
I chose this path so I suppose I have to deal with it
And no, this isn't an encore
It's more like a presentation by a boy fly as a Concorde with reservations levitatin'
Demonstratin' longevity, as he's never left the sky because he's never been let down by his own revelation
I left Patr√≥n alone with strong meditation but I'm convinced it's in my chromosome 'cause my heart's forever racing
I zone every day but I'm never dated
Even rechrome on every Saturday tints
I'm a culmination of all the reverend hates and the omen, but never Satan
I'm knowin' heaven's wait
If you come on down these roads
Down these roads where there's not a free soul
Quick highs, complete lows
Everything in here is expensive, even cheap clothes
He's hot, he's cold
Here we go

[Chorus]
'Round and 'round we go
First they love you
Go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you again, and it's
'Round and 'round we go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you
Go
Then they hate you again

[Verse 2]
Come on down these roads
Where people get real slick real quick
Makin' millions ain't even the guarantee
But you will eat so in a sense, this is your meal ticket
Niggas will sit and eat with ya
Leechers and ass and feet-kissers
Trash bitches and sit and wait for you to finish that cheap liquor so she can sleep with ya
But naw, this ain't back in the day
These bitches these days like to take sneak pictures without asking you straight
Shit, she might even end up leakin' 'em to the internet
Five minutes before your bride-to-be can pass the bouquet
For that infamous five minutes of fame
It's crucial timin' but you decided to
Come on down these roads
But you done signed it
The contract is in black and white
And you might as well try to just make a movie out it
You livin' inside the house fans built
They might decide to move you out and

[Chorus]
'Round and 'round we go
First they love you
Go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you again, and it's
'Round and 'round we go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you
Go
Then they hate you again

[Verse 3]
Come on down these roads
Where shit can get real lit
Niggas can fly quick as they wheels lift
Over that SoundScan, that Nielsen
Over that crowd chant, they will sin
Over that ball life, life flashes right before our eyes
Like that check engine, that aura light
You might go fuck a whore and roar, you know I'm right
Your wifey tryna claw and fight for ya
Blowin' up your phone at 4 at night
She might go fuck your boss in spite
That's if you not the loyal type
That's if you got the kind of boys who mad 'cause you don't throw 'em cash
Each time they owe and ask you to go and stashes
If the answer's no, then you so irrational
You the one who ruined 'em, you shouldn't have spoiled his ass then
But you don't wanna hear that one
Come on down these roads
Where by the time that you've developed a buzz
You realize that Coke ain't even a helluva drug
Rick James lied to you 'cause everybody and their mom do it
You might've even been high and seen God do it

[Chorus]
'Round and 'round we go
First they love you
Go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you again, and it's
'Round and 'round we go
Then they hate you
Go
Then they love you
Go
Then they hate you again
