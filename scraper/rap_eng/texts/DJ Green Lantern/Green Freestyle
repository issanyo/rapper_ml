It's Tragedy Khadafi - reppin' wit my nigga Green Lantern -
All y'all coward ass niggas
Put some grease on your motherfuckin' feet and slide, nigga!
Yo -

What it be like?
Niggas want to face-fight, I stay tight, stay right
Get your wig split
Shit that I spit - most accurate
Lex right in back of it
Range on the side of it
Dough, I'm trying to get a lot of it
I rock that exotic shit
Plus spit the hottest shit
Blow trial? Might get the same time Gigante get
Death Before Dishonor shit
Gangsta persona shit
2-5, Murder Inc. niggas - who I holla wit
When I wanna score, Green Lantern's who I polly wit
Your 'hood to my projects
Exchange objects
Your guns for my techs
Your Range for my Lex'
From Q.B. to upstate - we control set
I stay splurgin' - head stay wrapped in turban
Game tight like a virgin - Ford Excursion
Nigga how you figure that we don't be reppin'?
Wholesale drugs and weapons in a Dodge Intrepid
What a thug about?
Y'all niggas gettin' slugged out
In the back seat
Showin' the Beast the drug house
I'll cut your tongue out
Mail it to your spouse
If I get knocked, the bail money's under the house
To my thugs in the Dirty South - tear the club up
Masked and gloved up(What we gonna do Trag?)
We gettin' fucked up
For the blood 'fetti
Hoes and drug 'fetti
Jump it off, ready for war - we slug ready
Coward ass niggas eat a dick and die slow
And for the record - I love my hoes(Y'all niggas ain't ready)
I respect when you strap packs under your clothes
Chains stay froze - lock and load
Get your money up, shorty - it's the life you chose
What you know about the princess cut - the icicles?
Lick you 'til your knees get weak and feel crippled
Blood over money - nothing come between my family
Embrace what you give and take what you don't hand me
It's gangsta - 2-5 shit - fuck a Grammy
Nigga
Green Lantern in your area - 25 to Life
