My block, a real nigga walk around
With that thing ready to pop
Man you gotta be crazy to think
I’m not, gonna do whatever I gotta do
If you should violate the crew
And stick your hands in my pot
It ain’t nothing to sweat
It’s like I’m someone that’s to come for your neck
In any the event that I’m shot
Don’t be surprised I know what you work too
I know a hundred niggas just like you

Let me tell you something, ya don't want it me neither
Man your boy is hot as 100 degrees fever
My bodyguard body long as a meat cleaver
The longer you sleep on them, the longer they sleep
Ya don't want it with me neither
Man your boy is hot as 100 degrees fever
My bodyguard body long as a meat cleaver
The longer you sleep on them, the longer they sleep in ya
Now I’m running through them hundreds and green chiefers
The … and godfather, to handle my job harder
Think I’m lebron with the ball plus the rocks
& My burgundy nike's with the mustard tops

Now we ride around town make them custom drops
It’s my block, screaming out fuck the cops
Lay cash on my mother, she laughs and I love her
Never will she read a book with my ass on the cover
Life short so we mash on the rubber
First one to hit her, last one to hug her
First one I visit, last one I love her
I’m passing the rubber, off my list
Then she getting passed to my brother

The neighborhood laughing at you, you mind as well choose your coffin
You got a record deal, and your shoes is talking
If they don’t pay me to party, I refuse to walk in
As a nigga got bills and the jewels to cost them
Nigga, careful how you approach us
Cause there's enough niggas out here
To hit everyone on your coach bus
It’s nice outside you can’t afford better timbs
I’m g6 ing on the beach with a set of twins
My rhyming ain’t shit, so you ain’t gotta go to a ball game
To see a base hit
Shit, only my click gotta say so
You know me, 50 & Yayo
Swallow your pride, I put you on a pay role
I’m still ghetto like a paddie or a …
I’m blowing sticky with the Maddie on a lay low
In case I gotta put you on your paddy on you able

Everybody listen up, cause there’s just a new kid in town
And I don’t give a fuck
I don’t own that shit in the first place
So you can burn like a south forest fire in its worst case
Everybody listen up, cause there’s just a new kid in town
And I don’t give a fuck
I don’t own that shit in the first place
So you can burn like a south forest fire in its worst case

You nosy niggas get clapped and panic
Tryina clean up the world like captain Planet
I wouldn’t even spare my trap on Janet
Sit back and stop hating, let me get my mac on damn it
Get a mirror, you’re not so fine
Bitch get out my face with your breath smelling like a …
We get harassed by the cops all the time
I’m a made man & you a little shrimp you know the popcorn kind
Go wind out in the back im spraying
Then have your family lighting candles like the blackout came
I know exactly what you here for
Your gossip filling your room & you
Can’t wait to hear more
