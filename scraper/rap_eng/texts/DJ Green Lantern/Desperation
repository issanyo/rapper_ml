[Verse: Jaden Walsh]
The day I ever lay the mic down I'm Christian
Did what's his face even go re listen
To his wack ass, back lashed track he got
Your fucking intro was a damn laughing stock
What you mentioning CB for? We live in the same place
The same school acting like we ain't in the same space
You acting like I owe you, bitch you should owe me
Featured on my song , now you think you control me?
Rapping is my habit, not backstabbin
Mentioning my name wrong, that's back tracking
Choke when I challenge you, that shits happenin
Your TL Kids remix, that shits wack and
You'll never get to my spot, you don't have the rocks
To spend years jotting lyrics and you have to top
The best rhyme every time to stay at the top
Confront cops and they say that you have to stop
Listen dog I'm the most humble man you'll know
Knock me to the stars? you can't  withstand a blow
From me, and I'm only 5,6
You only look taller cause your always on 9 dicks
Say tough shit, while we laugh at your wardrobe
No time for recovery I spit with a sore throat
I don't wanna even go on
Writing simple, these lyrics aren't even worth wasting lead on a pencil
But I can guarantee that they'll still love it
I could diss myself on it and they'll still bump it
Take your broken ass track and throw that bitch in the garbage
First thing I fucking said was, this is retarded
A bitch made faggot wanna take my spot
You must think your really hard since your pierced like Pac
Bust out that lyric book, let's see what kinda shit you got on me
Let's hear how much that I'm everything you wanna be
You won't go up and rap, right there front of me
If you really think your bars are better then prove it
I honestly think that your starting to lose it / I can't tell if your just retarded or stupid
To diss Jaden Walsh and just not expect / him to respond with a more hostile threat /
And what the fuck you mean, how I look at the guys tho?
When it comes to faggotry, your in the top 4
For most homo human beings around
Rap battle me when you see me town
Surrounding our self in a big ass crowd
Your pussy if you don't, fuck your little bitch nameless pals
And if you wanna respond back, do it at will / but just remember doing so is stupid as hell
You use playground insults, ain't that tough shit /and you can't rap that's how much you suck dick
You must be out your mind, if you think that I'm bad
Quit trying feed off me, look at the size graph
Your taller than me, yet I'm bigger than you
What's that meant to mean? I'm giving a clue
Quit while I'm going easy there's no dissing for you
Your not worth the effort to cook up some lyrics for you
Not a single fucking fan gonna believe in you
I'm gonna give you a break, I'm gonna leave this I'm through
