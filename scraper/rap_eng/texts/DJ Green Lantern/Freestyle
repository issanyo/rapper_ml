[Verse (Benzino)]:
The only ‘M&M’ I know is Made Men
By the way, he ain’t never gone play me
Show this bitch what it really is to be Shady
I don’t care how much records you sold
You can’t walk through the hood without the Men in Black
You disrespect your moms’ bitch, you deserve a smack
It’s not a black and white thing, that shit’s in the past
I got some white boys from Boston that’ll bust your ass

[Outro (Eminem)]:
Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that...!
