[M-1]
You should Google
The Amero
Then the Afro
Then the Euro
Anything
For that green
It's a scam
It's a scheme

[Hook]
What people do for money
Anything for that green
What people do for money
It's a scam, it's a scheme
What people do for money
Anything for that green

[Intro: protestor]
We're talking about a bailout for some of the wealthiest banks in the world, and yet we can't seem to help our own citizens who are having foreclosure crises--

[Intro: news announcer]
--the bailout on the house floor, warning it could destroy the dollar, and the global economy--

[Intro: legislator]
--working families are suffering, unemployment is over 10% in my own district, we have over 2,300 people who have lost their homes to foreclosure, retirement and pension funds are losing value, local government can't make decisions--

[Verse 1: Stic.man]
For a five dollar bill
Certain parts of the real
You can get your blood spilled
On the concrete
Little 17 year old nigga doing foul in the hood
On the prowl, out in these streets
I've been in the same situation
Heartbeat racing
You come up or you don't eat
I done had to sleep in a train station
Going stop to stop, but no place to be
Paperchasing
Filling out applications for weeks
Just trying to get up on my feet
But they ain't hiring
So a nigga's forced to resort to the streets
Just to make ends meet
It's called survival
The struggle continues
If it offends you
Let me remind you
We all have instincts
To do what we have to do
To make it through
And this drive is primal
Whether you at MickeyD's taking an order
Or coming from Florida transporting a quarter
Or on a corner
We all got needs
I gotta feed my son
He gotta feed his daughter
Naw, I ain't no capitalist-exploiter
But I know the rules of supply and demand
Whoever controls the product
Controls the supply
And, well, hey that's the law of the land
Make your own stimulus plan

[Hook]

[Verse 2: M-1]
People lie
People cheat
People steal
People will
Do anything
For that green
It's a scam
It's a scheme
You should Google
The Amero
Then the Afro
Then the Euro
Dollar bills don't make you royal
It can kill you
It can cure you
Love for money
Root of evil
I say lack of it
That's more accurate
Army, navy, special forces
Rob the land of its resources
Gold, oil, guns, ice
Gas, corn, beans, rice
It's your life
You better think twice
How bad you want that?
Name your price

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stic.man]
Don't ever think slavery was just about race
Slavery was about money
They say the USA was founded on freedom
But slavery built this country
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln
Hamilton, Jackson, Grant
Were all slave-owners
And even today
From Clinton to Bush
They running the same game on us
They so-called war on terror
Is just a ploy to get more cheddar
Dinero, the root of all evil
They come in bombing, shooting, exploit the people
And call it freedom
It's a cold game
And it's the same from the top of the food chain
All the way down to the little homie in the street gangs
Slanging cocaine, it's how they do thangs
It's the American way
Imperialism, have it your way
Whatever it takes
Whoever gets fucked in the process, that's okay
That's how they play
So you can't blame us
Them dead white men on that paper ain't us
We still gotta hustle for the benefits, man
My grind is my stimulus plan...

[Hook]

[Outro: legislator]
And my constituents are concerned about
Where the 700 billion dollars is going
They want to know
Because they get up every morning
They work hard
They give up their tax dollars
And they're trying to figure out
Where did the money go?
Where's it going?

[Hook]
