[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away away
It's a beautiful bliss
When you feel like this
When you spill out hits
When you fly as a bitch
And you ride with this
And you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 1: Wale]
Fresh out the airport
Fresh out the chair with the clippers
Like Shaun living, thinking hmm
I'm trying to get it like Sean get it
If lord giveth a mill and a milf light skinneded
It's slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That anvil Neidhart minus bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my heart's in it
When Bret Hart meet Brett Farve
A sharpshooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less six or more
I invest in my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My project is like what pros inject
And a nigga so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath no joke
You see dem boys sign me to the scope right

[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away away
It's a beautiful bliss
When you feel like this
When you spill out hits
When you fly as a bitch
And you ride with this
And you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 2: J.Cole]
I phone home to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil nigga from the Ville could get a deal
And tell dem niggas at the top we want yo spot we are for real
And, yeah, we heard you got it locked but like dem socks we on your heels
So you best be on your toes, nigga
Especially on your flows, nigga
Cause man they keep on checking for me especially all your hoes, nigga
Catch me on your doorstep you see me let me in
All I wanna do is eat I'm like the freaky lesbian
Now all I wanna do is ball on TV need E-S-P-N
They heard I'm 'bout to blow, so all my enemies say let's be friends
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
And all the girls we knew that screamed fuck you going let me then
I'm definitely in a class of my own, at dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton, he just pass the Patron
Ain't nothing given, dog, it's earned if you just living, dog, you learn
I let you niggas see the light I'm like the prison yard, I yearn
For that living large, but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your sunrise
Kick back and know yo son set
Forever I ain't run yet and I never will
Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said fuck the world and I ain't come yet
You up yet
My punchlines like gut checks I'm raw-dog
I'm rough sex
I'm on deck I'm up next
I'm god bless, I'm success so fuck stress
You can get the fuck from around me
And if you listening know you wondering
Where the fuck they found me
I'm from the Ville, boy

[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away away
It's a beautiful bliss
When you feel like this
When you spill out hits
When you fly as a bitch
And you ride with this
And you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 3: Wale]
Another day up in my ES
Wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet, fuck it
I donâ€™t be stressed like relaxed muscles
Your feedback ain't plussing
And you can keep it running like a muffler
When we not in summer
They like A-list actors, they not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function, I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female vagina punctu-
Waiting, showing you her beauty if she's naked
It's like a view of a painting or a lakehead
This shit's how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital from Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or it I placement cause
Shifted keys gets your capital raised up

[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away away
It's a beautiful bliss
When you feel like this
When you spill out hits
When you fly as a bitch
And you ride with this
And you ain't bothered a bit now, baby
