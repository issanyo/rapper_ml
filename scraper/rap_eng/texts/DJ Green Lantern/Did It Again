[Intro]
Uh oh, I did it again, uh oh, I did it again
Uh oh, I did it again, when the stars come out at night

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
Maybe this is all my fault, maybe I done led you on
And I know you wanna be the only one that’s on my arm
But the way I’m seeing us is we just met and that is all
Just meant to bend you over, I ain’t mean to make you fall
But girl, don’t take it wrong, you open off this life that I been leading
All them lights and all them meetings but what I look like repeating, huh?
I like variety, them ladies that gon’ ride with me
The ones that keep it low then we get high with high society
But you enamored with the status and the glamour
In my phone, you see me texting, texting, texting, go bananas
And uh, I do not blame you though, I guess you see success in me
I wonder if you want me or you fuck me for who message me
You acting innocent, I know that that’s a lie
Got attached because Emilio know how to treat you right
You sleeping next to me, I let you stay the night
But you gotta know that good morning mean goodbye, I’m sorry girl

[Hook]
(Uh oh, I did it again)
I didn’t mean to, I swear I didn’t mean to
(Uh oh, I did it again)
And now you calling me, you telling me you leaving him
(Uh oh, I did it again)
I fuck around and made you wanna be my only
But you gon’ only end up lonely
(When the stars come out at night, I’m gone)

[Verse Two: Emilio Rojas]
I’m a charmer, I ain’t mean to make her fall in love
Now she think I’m balling ‘cause I call her up from Charles de Gaulle
And I’m on terraces in Paris with some foreign models
And when we driving, we be riding in them foreign models
I like exotic things, lotta things I bring to you
Finger you then lick you off my fingers, now you finger food
Oh, you a singer too? You know I’m a musician
And you wanna keep it classy, fuck it, I could pay tuition
Long as I can pay you visits as I please
And when we in your room, I get to rip apart your knees
And when I’m not at home, you never ever stressing me
‘Cause baby, you my fucking asthma pump, you let me breathe, yeah
Don’t be the type that gets emotions all confused
It’s electrifying with us baby, please don’t blow a fuse
The message I am giving ya is we can keep it cool
Or it’s out with the old, in with the new, yeah

[Hook]
