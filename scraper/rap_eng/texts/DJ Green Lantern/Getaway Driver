[Verse 1]
As soon as we see em, I'm a pull over you goin hop out
Don't say a word, walk up to em
Put the clip in his mouth
Then jump back up in the whip
Don't leave the gun that's movie shit
We goin use that same joint again
I peel off, runnin through the stop signs
Foot up on the gas, got a car full of hot iron
I'm flyin hand on the steering wheel, other on the semi kid
Fuck the police, I'll show em what a Hemi is
You shoot em up I'm the getaway driver, speeding up the runway
Holdin the 4 5 up, we jus niggas then merc up in and smile at em
You ready then hop in nigga and we goin ride up

[Hook]
You shoot em up and I'm the getaway driver
Hop in my car I'm the getaway driver
The cops comin I'm the getaway driver
Getaway getaway getaway driver

You shoot em up and I'm the getaway driver
Hop in my car I'm the getaway driver
The cops comin I'm the getaway driver
Getaway getaway getaway driver

[Verse 2]
Yea cops can't catch me, I'm a boss in a Porsche truck
And the Charger, the Patr√≥n got me charged up
Flying on that highway, police right behind me
Swerving in and out of lanes, turn the wheel sideways
I'm a treat it like a lay, homie you ain't gotta pay
You can pop sumthin nigga bet I get us outta here
I'm a push the seat back put the muzik on blast
The way I drive is like I'm flyin in a spacecraft
Cadillac matching whip snappin green land and shit
Black bandana on my head, ones on my wrist
You wanna getaway, you ain't gotta a way
I'm outside, engine running, we goin getaway

[Hook]
You shoot em up and I'm the getaway driver
Hop in my car I'm the getaway driver
The cops comin I'm the getaway driver
Getaway getaway getaway driver

You shoot em up and I'm the getaway driver
Hop in my car I'm the getaway driver
The cops comin I'm the getaway driver
Getaway getaway getaway driver
