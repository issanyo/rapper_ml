[Intro]
Yeah
(Yo, Crazy)
Stana
(Dun know)
Yeah

[StanaMan]
Yo, Stana and Tizzle’s in the building
Ain’t nothing fake about this, it’s the real thing
Go hard, go hard, niggas know we flow hard
We leave skid marks on the beat, like a wheel spin

[Crazy Titch]
Big gats on the road, you clowns are children
Other man are garbage, I don’t care who feels them
Punchlines, similes, this is how I kills them
Broke arse niggas talking like they're getting meals in

[StanaMan]
Came jail back in '06 and we’re still in
You can ask about us on the roads, we’re still kings

[Crazy Titch]
Still floss, real ice, listen this is real bling
Careful what you say, before you get your face filled in

[StanaMan]
And I've got a mean right hook to push your grill in
Streets can’t forget my name because it still rings

[Crazy Titch]
Girls all around the world, plus your girl’s still grim
3-8-6 shots and the barrel wheel-spins

[StanaMan]
Like a burn out, I put the fucking word out
Because niggas got back what we stole, it's our turn now

[Crazy Titch]
Old school, brown white clothes, you better learn now
Careful what you say before you get your cell burnt out

[StanaMan]
So get it right because any rapper can take the mic
Step in the ring and get pied in the first round

[Crazy Titch]
I bust the first round, that’ll be the worst sound
1-8-7 make your team follow the hearse round

[StanaMan]
I stand firm with my Nikes on the Earth's ground
Still hot, step in the booth and lay a verse down

[Crazy Titch]
Air Max Skylines, Air Force 95’s
I’ve always got a fresh pair, you ain’t gotta like mine

[StanaMan]
90’s and Y-3’s, blue jeans and white tee's
AJ’s, AK’s cost around 9 G

[Crazy Titch]
Old traits of Old C, listen I’m a OG
And I’ve got a fresh pound of bless [?] OG
Four times a nine bar, listen I’m a whole key
Niggas talking like they’re hustling and getting no P

[StanaMan]
Niggas can’t approach T, niggas can't approach me
Hard face, Scarface something like Tony

[Crazy Titch]
Mantana, bang hammer, chisel, no bandana
Old school dan-dadda, if you’re bad show me

[StanaMan]
Bang hammers coldly, late nights no sleep
Roll deep, I control sheep like Bo Peep

[Crazy Titch]
I ain’t gotta phone about, me I've got my own heat
Close range, face shot, tell a fool go sleep

[StanaMan]
Lights out, nines out, spray a nigga's whole team

[Crazy Titch]
Fake cop superheroes acting like they won’t bleed

[StanaMan]
They don’t wanna shoot it out, they just wanna [?]

[Crazy Titch]
Getting bruddas locked up, turn them into co-dees

[StanaMan]
Nobody gives a fuck, he ain’t getting no beat

[Crazy Titch]
Now I’m rocking handcuffs like the fucking Rollie

[StanaMan]
Fuck around, get a fat lip and a nose bleed

[Crazy Titch]
In the dock, telling lies, if not don’t speak
Fuck around and chat shit, I swear down I’ll get your fucking house looked for the whole week nigga
