[Verse]
I'ma get snuffed, ‘cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I'll pipe down when the White House gets wiped out
When I see that little Cheney dyke get sniped out
Lights out, bitch, adiós, goodnight [gunshot] (AHH!)
Now put that in your little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute, ‘cause the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America; fuck the government!
Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck? Son of a bitch!
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword; a sensei
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that ut-slay itch-bay
Uck-say my ick-day, 'scuse my ig-pay atin-lay
But uck-fay you ig-pay (50!!!)
