Chorus: x2
Some niggas Blood and some niggas Crip(uh huh)
Some niggas thugs and some niggas is bitch(what?)
Some niggas ain't got nothing some niggas rich(you heard?)
Some niggas die frontin' and some livin' this shit(4 real)

Verse 1:
Aiyo we play for keeps, taught from day one, how to blaze the heat
300 and 60 ways to eat, razor blade your meat
I'm gettin' something, if not then I'm hittin' something
Definitely, especially if my ribs is touchin'
Out for mine, for your shines I blow you out your mind
You can throw 1000 signs, I'm only concerned about the dollar signs
Stackin' my cheese, stashin' my crack in back of my feet
State to state, nationally
Actually, factually
I fracture every member of your faculty, send your cavalry
I got And 1's that match with me, city capture me
I have them niggas scared to act with me, throw your man off the Tappan-Zee
Other members of your clan runnin' where the traffic be
Hollerin' "He bustin' big guns and comin' after me!"
I'm willin', real live shit, ain't no acting B
It's not a game, WE AIN'T PLAYIN'
Dunn we spraying
Won't stop till everyone laying, on the pavement
Every nigga you came with, is gettin' painted
We specialize in wet-in guys, technical lies, Smith-n-Wessonalise
I seen the best of them die
Especially testin' I, put the tek to ya eye
So you can see death, take a deep breath and say goodbye
Why?

Chorus:(x2)
Some niggas Blood and some niggas Crip(uh huh)

Verse 2:
Streets is too real, thugs nowadays is too ill
Fuck a hundred thou, i need a few mil
Even if it means you killed
You resting in peace i rest in blue steel
I'm even wet-in police and navy-blue seals
How crazy you feel?
Militant clique, ten in the whip
I know bohemians wit plenty of chips
Pull this off and we'll be rich
Filthy as top, bill the milkiest
In the hamptons, i know the mansions where they live
They on some ram shit, Hindu niggas, reading Sanskrit
I wanna man by every exit so they can't split
Rush the crib, all we see is candles lit
Yo they got gold cows, gold owls on some chantin' shit
Tied them up, red dot 'em up, fuck the ransom shit
Hit the safe, brick city case, back to the whip
Then we lace, back to B.K., Albany, relaxed in the PJ's
Splittin' mathematics on the weekday
Sound of pee traces, stuffed inside of briefcases
Quiet Money, keep our mouth shut like Freemasons, Pay me

Chorus (repeat til fade)
