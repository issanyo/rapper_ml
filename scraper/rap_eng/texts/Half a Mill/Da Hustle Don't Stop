[Intro: Half-A-Mill]
Uh huh, yea, yea, word
Yea, Half-A-Mill, Half-A-Mill
Yea, send this out to my true hustlers
Uh huh, true ballers, yea, word
Hustle don't stop baby, it don't stop
Neva stop son, it ain't gonna neva stop

[Verse 1]
When I'm on the mic I rock the mic right
When I'm on the block I rock the block right
Thousand grams of that chIna white
Five o'clock in the mornin
Out on that corner bubble straight to that night
And we sell bricks, still handle some jail shit
Gram to gram, cannon in the CL 6
I'm a born hustler, takin all of ya costumers
My dimes bigger then your 20's dawg 'em fiends run for us
Uh, from the gutter, my wakes stay butter
Voice spot on sutter
No time for toy cops, snitches or free lowin bitches
Kisses, Mrs's, I'm tryin to put these ki's in your britches
And get this...money, and you can keep your brain
I'm like new and improved willy dynamite, deep in the game
My neck surrounded by ice, four pounds
Homey down semi's keep more rounds
They wit me for life
I squeeze 50 in the kidney in Christ
Lord forgive me but this thug shit is in me pissy drunk of Henny
Lil' man got truck on 20's, I mean 22's
We rub pennies together and turn 'em into jewels

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
Da Hustle Don't Stop (don't stop)
Get money, we count master got the government hot (word)
Da Hustle Don't Stop (Da Hustle Don't Stop)
Fiends runnin the spot hundred to pop
And we huggin the block
Da Hustle Don't Stop (yea)
Comin through on the drop
Block flooded fiends rubbin 'em rocks (Half-A-Mill)
Da Hustle Don't Stop (uh)
Still livin on top
I bring the club Cris and Henny to pop

[Verse 2]
I put the pedal to the metal
Coke in the kettle
It's Hell on Earth, got fiends smokin the devil
Niggas scotin my bezle, the ice bling
Like lightnin you flash your gat I fire at thing
You faggots is wack, I stay on my grind, actioned pack
32 from mac, ain't no bringin you back
What your crew gonna do when these slugs come for you?
Beside run and duck, son ain't tryin to fuck wit you
Died over a buck or two
I'm tryin to cop a truck or two
Truck his jewels, ain't got no love for you fools
While you puffin 'em oo's, I'm stuffin my shoes
Thugged out, you know the rules, I ain't tryin to lose
I'm supplyin 'em dudes
Wit that rollie that move faster then Chinese food
Keep my mind on my loot

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
Da Hustle Don't Stop (it don't stop)
Get money, we count master got the government hot (uh huh)
Da Hustle Don't Stop (neva)
Fiends runnin the spot hundred to pop
And we huggin the block
Da Hustle Don't Stop (it don't stop)
Comin through on the drop
Block flooded fiends rubbin 'em rocks
Da Hustle Don't Stop
Still livin on top (Half-A-Mill)
Up in the club Crys' and Henny to pop

[Verse 3]
We went from Medicaid to Escalades
Your boys hella paid
I rock 360 waves instead of braids
Born hustler, federal trade, flexed wit a gage
Up in the mansion gettin head from the maid
Came a long way from federal raise, neva been played
I should get an award on every Veterans Day
Word to the Lord, get mine, or I'm murkin you broad
Dawg I neva put that metal away
Why wait for the 'morrow? for somethin we can settle today
Just lift off the clips and let the chips lay where they made
From the A to the K I make 'em pay what they weight
Day to day, I guess I neva change my ways
Niggas hatin cause my chains is gray
Straight shittin leave stains on 'em
Let the four pounds bang on 'em
I rains on 'em, from Spring to Autumn
The game is callin, you know Half-A-Mill stay guard
From wake of the horror, Queens to Brooklyn
Who let the crooks in? I'm jooks in
Niggas done bring the hooks in

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill] **repeat 2X**

[Outro: Half-A-Mill]
Half-A-Mill, uh, Half-A-Mill, Brooklyn
Yea, (Da Hustle Don't Stop)
New York City, Ali papa, the crime don't stop
Uh huh, (Da Hustle Don't Stop) neva!
Crown Heights projects, Brooklyn
(Da Hustle Don't Stop) New York City
All over Brooklyn, the whole Universe
Yo, (Da Hustle Don't Stop) neva stops y'all
**fades to the end**
