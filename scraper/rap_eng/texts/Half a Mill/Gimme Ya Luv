[Half A Mill]
While my hustlers be on corner, L caught in bright shines
Versace bitch snortin white lines, ridin my pipe line
The name's Half A Mill, but ladies choose to call me Nighttime
Relax on sofas, reef it up, sippin white wine
Ya bodies rockin, Power U, that of the tight kind
Thug brown and light dime, inspire me to write rhymes
You got me goin, blowin my sexual omen
The only hoe in this world, to whom Half A Mill's dosed it
I'm sailin on yachts, coast to coastin, grossin potion
While you droppin off weight on Albany, mistral notion
I be back in two months, with foreign currency
English pounds for you mosquito soprano's and licorice gowns
Parion, battle rounds, I'm be the King from Crown
I got more persons, places and things than a noun
Gotta get mine, can't let these thug niggas send me above
I'm the King of Kings, you the Queens of Queens, mad love

Gimme Ya Luv, Gimme Ya Luv

[Half A Mill]
We can travel thru worlds, have a few boys, have a few girls
You push ya paint Lex baby, cease wearin 5th Avenue pearls
Livin life like a trillionaire, Egyptian fragrant scrub ya rear
Love ya hair, waist thicker than rugby wear
Queen original, picture me in your visual
As the only individual, you'll ever listen to you
Your Nefetiti appearance can't get no cleaner
You the bomb baby, other bitches is Hiroshima
Take a sip of wine or two, it's my sub-race combinin you
When Earth is my surface, oceans deeper than chronicles
I got a wand for you, applyin forces honor you
You said I'm your boo, and my wand is wonderful
We gotta get mine, can't let these drug niggas send me above
I'm the King of Kings, you the Queens of Queens, mad love

Gimme Ya Luv, Gimme Ya Luv

[Half A Mill]
I'm royal, so let my seed soak in your soil
Let me open this for you, got the coconut oil
Divine I C King got you spoiled
3/4's of water that covers your surface, boils
I got preservers in them coils
My aliant from Zion, sexy tiger from Niger
Sayin Half, I wanna ride ya, full length up inside ya
Multiply like Ilijah, got you drippin saliva
40 Thieves between ya knees, gettin hit with the Bible
Get on or can get the knife, cuz you be splittin tomorrow
Wedding Gown on Greyhound, wit a hidden revolver
Ya body consist of matter, girl, and I'm the resolver
The rise of sun, got you on your knees, sayin "Please father" word up
