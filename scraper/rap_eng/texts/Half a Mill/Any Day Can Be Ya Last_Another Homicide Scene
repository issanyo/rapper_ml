(Verse 1: Half a Mill)
Me and my man used to get dough, before he got hit yo
This type of skit i can't forget no
Shit go like this, we was chillin' had three L's
62 on the scale, givin' details about females
He passed the Alize and said my mans comin' for pick up
I took a sip it made me hiccup, i filled the clip up, in case a stick up
He said half chill its aight, ease
Save these for enemies, these niggas got g's for keys
Won't be no casaulties, he said these niggas is peeps
Imma take the weight to the jeep, hit the cash and imma leap
So i went to the fridge for a rare taste, he left the crib and hit the staircase
I turned his tv on and saw the man's face
Then i turned on the nintendo, as i lit up the endo
I heard gunshots outside the window
Its my friend yo, layin' front infront the buildin'
I didn't really realise shit was real until then
See, thats what i mean niggas get killed for this green
This story lies between another homicide scene

(hook)
Call me the guillotine
Call me the guillotine
See what i mean another homicide scene
Call me the guillotine
Call me the guillotine
Everydays another homicide scene
Call me the guillotine
Call me the guillotine
Damn, another homicide scene
Call me the guillotine
Call me the guillotine

(verse 2 : Half a Mill)
Word is bond another homicide scene
I was headed to the cleaners , to get my fila suit out
A nigga ran behind me grabbed my pocket, tried to snatch my loot out
A grabbed my gat squeezed off and as bullets shoot out
He got hit, the blood oozed out, panicked and tryed to move out
I hopped in my ride so i can cruise out
I got to find a new route, coz imma loose out
Soon as these snitches get the news outs
I head back to the projects on (????) and prospect
You get murdered for material objects
The profit'll drop , topics like fiber optics
My instinct and sniper logics got me blastin off like hyper rockets
Coz the streets is mad wild
Niggas is mad foul
They have a nigga coppin' out at trial
Before the jury reads the verdict
15 for slayin' a teen
Another homicide scene

Call me the guillotine
Call me the guillotine
Everydays another homicide scene
Call me the guillotine
Call me the guillotine
Damn, another homicide scene
Call me the guillotine

Word is bond another homicide scene
The way its told nowadays niggas is made from trife
The streets is cold 15 year olds is facin' life
In the max, shortys puttin' slugs in niggas back with a mac
Takin ya stack and half an ounce of crack
Niggas be headed out of state with weight
To get paid it be great, jakes sprayed now yous an inmate
Amongst ya peers with no fears
Your eyes got flooded with tears
When the judge said 60 years
Huh, i wander downlow these days takin' it easy
Niggas is buckwildin' in the PJ's
Runnin' up in niggas cribs
Bustin' shot , stray bullets be hittin' kids, bloodstains left on the babys bib
Undevine true indeed, its hard to percieve
When ya seed had to bleed over a pound of weed
See what i mean niggas get killed for this green
This story lie between another homicide scene
