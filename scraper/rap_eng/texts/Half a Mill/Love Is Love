[Interlude: AZ]
AZ Ha, ha, ha, new drink, Baileys and Henny
You ain't got no Henny, get the Remy
You ain't got the Remy, any cognac'll do
Smooth criminal shit baby

[Half-A-Mil]
Keyser SÃ¶ze intention
Glide in a Hummer wit the flyin' saucer engine
Willied out, at my crib in the winter having cookouts
Smack my wiz, look out
I'm like Barnabas, crab niggas tryin' to conquer us
They mad cuz we jump outta cabs, and hop on the bus
Coppin' dust, Firm Clique rock the whole Metropolis
Bitches who burn dick won't put a stop to us
Niggas who-

[Intro: AZ]
See; this is what I mean
When we come together like this
Incredible things take place
See we connect thoughts to collect shorts
And only the strong survive
I love my black people
We are the future

[Nina Simone]
Black is the colour of my true love's hair
His face so soft and wondrous fair

[Verse 1: AZ]
Chop the pie up, four ways, get lyed up
Infiltrate never violate get tied up
It's all a chess game, choose sides, the best remains
True lies, vibes die when bums infest the game
Bogus shit shock you broke and let your man get locked
I live this hip-hop, stock the bank let the crys pop
Peep the next shit, push a big Benz fuck a Lexus
The streets is hectic so I stacked and made my exit
More dough to get focus my thoughts for me to go legit
Ferocious shit, cop a huge castle on a ocean cliff
Imagine that a few years back I was baggin cracks, magnum gats
Playin street corners committing savage acts, twistin up
Nothin but love for niggas sittin up
Hold your own try to comin home without gettin touched
Two for one laws made foul how they do the young
Was new to come try to tell shorty he shoulda threw the gun

[Verse 2: Half-A-Mil]
Knowledge the green Wally's
All I see my mind hold math like caller ID
Chose the path that chose me
I'mma tell you like G-O-D told me
Greed lust hate and envy sweet dust from shanty
Keeps us from simply...unify organizin
We all are fallin when we think we all risin
We pop crys on the horizonin
Topless chicks with thick thighs'in
I rather be civilizin, enterprisin, improvisin
Temperature risin, Elohim gave me the guidance
Told me "leave those 85ers alone
Blend with the wise men", that bought 80 G stones
Twin Mercedes on homes, fuck it, just spend 10 G alone on chrome
When I die take my chromosomes and clone clones
200 and 8 bones, microchip kids we most dominate
You know what time it is thats why I exist
Jump out a limo lands fire the place
Why scientist supplyin this Leviathan why this?
I'm survivin this quiet tribalness
Finalist year 2000 flyin the whips
9 cent, mind bent, 1999 rhyme align'ment

[Verse 3: Nature]
We went from arraignments to entertainment
24/7 after the same shit playin the strip livin dangerous
Bottle after bottle soon became a ritual
The patterns we follow others found 'em difficult
I guess it's obvious as to what my hobby is
The root of all evil pollute same niggas body kids gettin caught up
The same gang that left more stuck
I reminisce on VS touchin my fourth cup
Me my only problem is I'm all fucked
Knowin in my heart I can't sleep, til I bust off nuts
We religion for all my niggas that beat the system
And those who bidden sittin' since ColecoVision
Ya'll need to listen, it's journalistic
Ya'll hear the whispers the niggas in the Firm is twisted
Spit that fly shit that earn the bitches
Whip the chrome 6 up the FDR, its bless we are
See I never let them stress me God, forever stress-free
While twistin logs for that nestle
Who are you to question me?
It's just my destiny to kick back kill time and live successfully

[Outro: AZ]
Firm, how y'all want it huh, ha ha
Talk to me, we give it to y'all either way
We workin with y'all, this is for you!
Love is love, 9-8, Firm shit
