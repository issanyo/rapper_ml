[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She wanna get it so she do me all up on the wall
She wanna get it so she do me all up on the wall
I wanna get it so I do her all up the wall

[Verse 1: Brisco]
Yeah I be that nigga Brisco
When I come through they know I’m known to ball
She sippin’ Nuvo while I’m puffing got them on the wall
Got the spliff half stick
Hands on the handle bars
Hop in with the top back now I’m in the lane, bowling ball
Ha, I might be going about one hundred miles
Sippin’ on that Henny in the ‘ghini I be going hard
She like don’t leave me papa
I’m not a G but Im here you ever need me need me

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She wanna get it so she do me all up on the wall
She wanna get it so she do me all up on the wall
I wanna get it so I do her all up the wall

[Verse 2: Brisco]

Shawty done forgot her draws
Check the bathroom and bye bye I'mma beat her in the stall
Everybody on the wall
And we on that alcohol
Shit can happen, clap clappin’ round of applause
Ha, I might be going about one hundred miles
Sippin’ on that Henny in the ‘ghini I be going hard
She like don’t leave me papa
I’m not a G but Im here you ever need me need me

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She wanna get it so she do me all up on the wall
She wanna get it so she do me all up on the wall

[Verse 3: Brisco]
I’m under her arrest my hands completely cuffed
She always in control
I know she like it rough
Never you let her fuss
Never try to call her phone
Just hit her with a text to let her know it’s on
Throw her all up on the wall
Now I’m up on her fanny
She probably South Beach
Fountain blue Miami
I know she want get it
And I’m so quick to get it
I always pull her hair
And ask her how it feel
Uhh, Brisco

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She wanna get it so she do me all up on the wall
She wanna get it so she do me all up on the wall
I wanna get it so I do her all up the wall
I wanna get it so I do her all up the wall
