[Intro: Rick Ross]
Trilla

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm worth a million dollars, I been worth a million dollars
I been worth a million dollars, I been worth a million dollars
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm makin' women holla, I'm makin' women holla
Makin' women holla

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I just left my momma house and it made me feel good
I just paid my momma bills, you would if you could
You see I'm from the ghetto where you gotta go to prison
Cause niggas in the ghetto always end up in the system
But I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
Convertible Impala, wouldn't drive what I'm ownin'
Plus I'm ballin' like them brothers smokin' on that California
Hit the freeway, and I'm kickin' with my brother
Nigga got a a lies in this whip, I'm undercover
Gotta handle my business, I came up with a plan
And my mind active, I'm in a lime green Lamb'
Yeah them hoes wanna ride with us
I love to drive on them two wheels, know they love us
Got 'bout 20 stacks up in my jeans
At the interstate, we gettin' sucked in between, you see

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm worth a million dollars, I been worth a million dollars
I been worth a million dollars, I been worth a million dollars
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm makin' women holla, I'm makin' women holla
Makin' women holla

[Verse 2: Gunplay]

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm worth a million dollars, I been worth a million dollars
I been worth a million dollars, I been worth a million dollars
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm ridin' through the ghetto and I'm worth a million dollars
I'm makin' women holla, I'm makin' women holla
Makin' women holla

[Outro: Rick Ross]
You gotta understand the feeling baby
It's like comin' to the crap game, clearin' 'em out
Nigga done came up, feel me?
Now I'm a billionaire, big boss
Let's say I'm comin' down on some shit that I
I paid four hundred thousand for
I paid that with a smile
I'm comin' down, mines be all I drive
It's all the way live
Boss about, boss, and I love to floss
It ain't even that deep
You gotta follow close
When I saw that PF Changs we can do some thangs
I'm a real nigga though
Ha! We the Best, so fresh
I'm higher than a motherfucker man
And I'm trilla, trilla, trilla
