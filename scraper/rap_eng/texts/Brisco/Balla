Take one glance and the Prada got 'em hatin' on me
Gun shinin' on the waist yeah the waist sunny

Jack boys souvenirs to the big tummy
New year chopper wet like the nose runny
Shot clothes takin over what [?]
Sorrowed light bulbs where the sound light blows
The south got soul grand mama got gold
Real granddaddy like formin' no smoke

Got to get fat carrots see these xxx like kimor
Thick hips holla back like I'm in a lambo
Playin' xxxxxxx my career peep the rap game cold
