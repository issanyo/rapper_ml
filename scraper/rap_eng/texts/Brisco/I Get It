[Verse 1]
What's on my mind? More cake
I'm here to save the world, nigga, no cape
Superman oral, I get it in the booth
No time to lay in bad, she could get it in the coup
Yeah. Okay, I'm spinning like the world is ending
New deal out from my ex, she think I'm Earl Simmons
I told her she can ride if she like it rough
Chasin' paper, you ain't rich until you reach it's fuck
One mil', I'm in a penthouse, two mil', I'm in a big house
Three mil', about a whole block, and this pussy niggas getting kicked out
Four mil' I'm in the G4 blowing a C4, bow so hard, gotta keep it
So we're shooting to three throw

[Hook]
Rose, check. Models, check. I might blow it out when I get this shit
Don't tolerate no haters and no disrespect
I'm bowling like Lebrone with a plan, that's because I get it
I get it, get it
I'm on the ground so I get it, I get it, get it
I gotta shine so I get it, I get it, get it
You watch your mind if you don't get it, I get it, get it

[Verse 2]
They say I need a heat, well bitch I'm a roy
I swing, it ain't a thing to get me off a day job
I've hustle kicks, hustle flows
And if the models won't be modeling, even hustle hoes
Don't make me put you out of business like them rustle clothes
No disrespect the rustles but hustlers don't fuck with dogs
We ain't Jonvanchi, Machiavinchi, stupid know the difference
Destroy, get the heat, feed us at Olympics
Wicked on the dash, show the lady's got that back
Pack a flow, I'm on that ass, had the greatest time in Vegas
Blowin' bands, I ain't talking plug it leonard
If she bounce that moukee on me, peal a stack off like bananas
Bitch, I kill it

[Hook]
Rose, check. Models, check. I might blow it out when I get this shit
Don't tolerate no haters and no disrespect
I'm bowling like Lebrone with a plan, that's because I get it
I get it, get it
I'm on the ground so I get it, I get it, get it
I gotta shine so I get it, I get it, get it
You watch your mind if you don't get it, I get it, get it
Pacino

[Verse 3]
Do you know who I is?
You see, bowling is a habit and I'm a kill it if you let me
About my racist team mens and bad bitches epics
Suck that dick massive, that's rich niggas see
While you're young and got sweat
That's what rich niggas get
Believe that? I'm getting money, you see that?
If you're a hater and you hate it
The pussy is go beat that
Don't boy oral, pimp that walker
Smokin' all good, projects walk
Downtown lights, new high rise
Fuck that girl right up, get baptized
Home born, nigga, flat line
But anyway we're in the club with a bunch of dimes

[Hook]
Rose, check. Models, check. I might blow it out when I get this shit
Don't tolerate no haters and no disrespect
I'm bowling like Lebrone with a plan, that's because I get it
I get it, get it
I'm on the ground so I get it, I get it, get it
I gotta shine so I get it, I get it, get it
You watch your mind if you don't get it, I get it, get it
