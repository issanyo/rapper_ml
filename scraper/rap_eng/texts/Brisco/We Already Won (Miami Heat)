[Intro: Piccallo]
Desloc, ya'll know (Oh boy)
Now you need to get low-ow-ow-ow-owww
Hey hey hey

[Hook: Piccallo]
(Oh) We already won, we already won
It ain't no need to play no more games
We already won, we already won
And ain't no more need to play no more games
Lemme hear you say we number one
Lemme hear you say we number one
Lemme hear you say we number one
We already won, we already won, hey

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hey you know we been did that
You talkin' bout a winner no L in the bag
Until we got LeBron dream throw it in the bag
I ride number one, it's the Miami Heat tag
I'm vibin and I'm stuntin in Miami Heat swag
Surprised when we called his number six on my rag,
The squad so sick can't get rid of Pat,
I know they got flick ain't get rid of Flash
Ain't no half, keep your daf
Got more money on my salary cap
The fitted in place for LeBron my scalp
King James throw some powder like we booming in a draft

[Verse 2: Ball Greezy]
We already won, we already won
We got LeBron James, it's already done
You seen the interview, you heard what he said
I'm-a do South Beach with my homeboy Wade
This Miami where the sun kinda hot
So its only right now down to the top get dropped
Born and raised in a county of Wade
Pop the bottles - Rosay and Spade
Let's celebrate! That this one for the crib
Another championship, we'll do it again
Play no games on the court, get it in
Cause all the Heat gonna do is just win

[Hook: Piccallo]

[Verse 3: Brisco]
Hot boy Brisco baby
Heat that flame, that fire blazing
Call me LeBron Opalocka James
And I don't even play no games, no sir
Let's go! Just know I'm so
Courtside seats are front row
Free throw, alley
I'm balling don't scuff my ballies
I'm chilling somewhere on South Beach
Pissin' my --- forever South Beach
Fire, fire, fire, scorching
Grey Goose Lounge let me pro boy

[Verse 4: Brianna]
It's the Miami Ma, mahee, mahee
Jetski South Beach, penthouse parties
Fly girls in Chanel bikinis everywhere
Star Island, you can find a boss anywhere
Night time 20K at LIV
Sky box to the floor, just trying to live
Poe boy the key like waitin'
Try to pick and roll with a team and we fadin' em
Even though we the best and we outta here
Triple A valet, showtime it is
Sown up for the next 5 years right here
We got money over here and it is what it is

[Hook: Piccallo]

[Verse 5: Billy Blue]
Play like it is, gotta play drop bombs
I used to play Kobe but now it's Lebron
Now we got em on hooves and the trap boom raw
Poe boy, hit em with the strong arm
Ohhhh, I get ahead in bounty
You got cash and thuggin in Wade county
Whippin work like feed the streets
One block gripping Miami Heat
For real! I'm a G like Chris Bosh
He could shoot threes, get off
Big boy, big body, big deal
One more seat on the bandwagon, hop in

[Hook: Piccallo]
