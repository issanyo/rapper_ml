[Intro: Brisco]
"Can I have your attention,"
I'd like to welcome all y'all tonight
Even as y'all ladies to the left beggin for drinks
Can we please get up on 'em
This is for all my balla calla's from all over the world
When we see a hata tryin to hard to get on our level
We just keep laughin at 'em
I don't get mad

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I, just, laugh at them hata's when we out here front and,..
No they ain't got it but they wanna be startin
D J for the record stop, "ha haha ha ha, we got it,"
Laugh at them hata's when we out here front and,..
No they ain't got it but they wanna be startin
D J for the record stop, "ha haha ha ha, we got it,"

[Verse 1]
We laughin at these hata's cause they funny
See they provide the motivation for me, to keep gettin money
So I duz theat and giggle in they face
All they see is my business cause I have nothin else to say
