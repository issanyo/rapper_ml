Beautiful mary jane, you are the finest thang
Every season you change, i’m blazing your remains
Purple heads on your body, sometimes i give you space
Baby you are my cushion, who cares about your weight
Never pass you to niggers, they just to take advantage
His name is reggie miller, they be walk in the campus
But girl i get you chauffeurs, i mean the highest rollers
We’re the most high jehova … big bodies where we roll up
Smoke up until it’s over, mama you’re going places
If it’s not california, it’s probably in jamaica
Wrap you in back woods in a vanilla dutches
I told you be aware of the niggers you fuck with

I throw my hands up been smoking all day
Kick ashes in the cup then roll another jay
When i puff, oho, when i puff, oho
Been smoking all good, don’t know another way
Kick ashes in the cup then roll another jay
When i puff, oho, when i puff, oho, yeah

Your smell is heaven scent, for fragrance that is
What cloud i’m on, who joint is this
She in the mix, like roll me like lick that and blow me
More fire than here be more fire gets higher
Burn six and flow slr
Throw away money, ashes of weed on the floor
An og’ kush that blue dream
That grandaddy purp that sour dies
Just relax and think, brisco got the hallway stink

I throw my hands up been smoking all day
Kick ashes in the cup then roll another jay
When i puff, oho, when i puff, oho
Been smoking all good, don’t know …
Kick ashes in the cup then roll another jay
When i puff, oho, when i puff, oho, yeah

I’m bumping bob marley as i steam up
Did i elaborate, i’m a genius
Look how i’m blinged up canary vvs black honest jesus head
So look at your discretion
I’m striving for perfection, rolling my rastafari
Popping my medication, now its time to party
You are my kush bitch, promise to never leave
I break you off something because i’m never greedy
Might get this for my dawg, but at a small portion
You are different quality so i spend the portion
Some people say i’m crazy because i love ya
So i just meditate and let her

I throw my hands up been smoking all day
Kick ashes in the cup then roll another jay
When i puff, oho, when i puff, oho
Been smoking all good, don’t know another way kick ashes in the cup then roll another jay
When i puff, oho, when i puff, oho, yeah
