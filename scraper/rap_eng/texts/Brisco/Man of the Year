[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Say, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga

[Verse 1: Brisco]
Only [?] be amazed, blowing big in the coupe
Prada loafers on the pedal as the dons shoot through
Been accused before my court date
I'm at the Ritz hotel, eating skirt steak
By the way, I met this bitch named Jezabel
She say her brother keep them numbers on that fish scale
'Til she exhale, girl, I be a real nigga
I know you heard that before, but I'ma deal wit you
On the low, Young Money help me sleep safe
If I rent some Weezy P and send a briefcase
I'm pimpalicious, explicit, and it's the way I live it
After we fuck, we can trade in your Honda Civic

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Say, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
(Flo Rida)
Like, damn, like I'm a human chandelier
Some Louis XIII standing next to a beer
Like Oprah Winfrey, women got her tongue pierced
Mike Tyson in the building, he just bit another ear
Like, round one, round two, round three
It's red carpet and I'm dressing like the referee
So many blood diamonds, Red Cross sweating me
Thrilla in Manila, are they staring at my ring?
That's about worth, Dolly Frazier, Don King
Senior high or junior high or elementary
They sweating like Keith cos my jewelry on me
That's my rhythm in blue stones, they dance like bling bling

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Cause another fucking nigga ain't shit

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I talkin' bout
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like, ain’t no nigga like, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Said, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Cause another fucking nigga ain't shit
I talkin' bout
Cause, ain’t no nigga like, ain’t no nigga like, ain’t no nigga like me
