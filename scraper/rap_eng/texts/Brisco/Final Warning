[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Yeah it's the DJ Khaled Khaled Khaled
I do this for the projects!
I got the mothafuckin gutta on this track
I got the projects on this one!

[Hook: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you know
Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So you betta mind where you walking
God damn man can to your target
Nothin can save you know

[Verse 1: Bun B]
See you dun push the wrong button
And Cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka it was mine
Time and time they get me out the tandem
Me are da true
I traded mine in
For caveman king
You don't wanna fuck with the Southside Gotcha boys
Ya'll ain't know trill ass niggas
Ya'll some boxy boys
And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

[Verse 2: Blood Raw]
I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet
I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks
I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the Street life
Homie I live
Wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top
East to the west
All I gotta say is Khaled
Nigga we the Best

[Hook: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you know

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Khaled go let me see em
Hand me the fucking clever
Cause I got a fucking fever
For all the Evel Knievel people
Who try to stunt
Call me Danny Glover
I'm lethal this ain't no sequel
Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon shoot a hundred rounds
Bdddddddddddddah
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

[Verse 4: Brisco]
I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old chevy and figuro
Blood shed apart my feet
And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye
Ring the Alarm
Tell em people come come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun YEAH!
It's the Final Warning!

[Verse 5: Bali]
Khaled these niggas talkin
I'm an orphin
And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one
Ain't golfin'
I'mma put his whole unit in a coffin
Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'mma open his ass off
Like suicide doors
Any badass niggas
Y'all scared of that lake
I'mma tell you once don't be scared of the dre

[Hook: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy we don't care who your callin
Nothing can save you know

[Verse 6: Lil Scrappy]
I'm usually cool
But know I gotta bet back
I tried telling ya
Ain't wit'cha death threats
I let my nigga know
Tell em go hammer that
And it ain't gon take all day
We know where you live at
Ill bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep em mad shawty
That's how we kill em babies
Holla Khaled
And tell him I'm on the way now
I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town

[Verse 7: Shawty Lo]
Look at me it's shawty
So bossy
And I don't feel like that
Can't stop me now
Ya See what's Haapning
Big shit dun popped off
I'm the best nigga
You can ask Khaled
You can ask Khaled

[Hook: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy we don't care who your callin
Nothing can save you know
Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So you betta mind where you walkin
God damn man can do your target
Nothin can save you know
