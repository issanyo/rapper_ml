[Verse 1]
Momma, look I'm everything I said I'll always be
And I ain't always right, but I am always me
And if they hard to see me winning, get your bi-focus
I'm in the tele-tube, women hope they buy focal
Into my focus I'm a set the city straight
I'm meeting good, it's only right, my niggas get a plane
I put this bars in the figure A, listen close
He fucked you with that Garry Coleman, I got different strokes
See, that's a little humor, we might as well laugh
So many bars, I got to walk around with bale cash
We like it curse you niggas blowing on that frail grass
And getting brains like a son of four at yell class
This is the life that I'm living and like the older momma happy
She takes pictures of everything that I bought her
She sends them to her friends like "look what my baby got me"
I think against they come don't fuck me don't sell me copies

[Hook]
It's like I'm dreaming
But my eyes are wide open
Still everything is perfect
I'm comfortable but I ain't resting
So I am hostile, just to make a living
They say that home is where the heart is
Heart of the city

[Verse 2]
I live for the come up from breakfast to supper
And I try to grab my stomach from the pains and the hunger
36 ounces have but ten housin', old school shower, be easy on the my hood
Grows hood salad, chop a scene palace
Heart of the city, niggas beyond average
Hip hop savage, princes got chariots
Heart of my arms are my arms of rush, lavage
And teens just to come upon some richest
Money in my heart but my landlord trippin'
And me and my plug got attention and nowadays it is harder to convince him
Music was like my dime. Holly fuck, when a nigga had time?
Lay back and climb as I blowin' a pile
Why is that, nigga? That's when I'm focus time

[Hook]
It's like I'm dreaming
But my eyes are wide open
Still everything is perfect
I'm comfortable but I ain't resting
So I am hostile, just to make a living
They say that home is where the heart is
Heart of the city

[Verse 3]
Hello, America, is me
Hello, to the city that made me gee
Came up on a courter key
I find money, is an a team
Maserati now fuck a beam
Shawty had a dream till she lost it like Christina
Out of mine shine no star
That is what I call time's hard
Speak of foreign in a foreign cup
Officer, I swear to drunk that I'm not God
Or is it the other way around? Bartender, please bring here another round
Heart of the city, clean musketeers, they ain't a musket, see you momma tears
I smile to my movement. Glass is up, toast, cheers!
We hear about no nigga name. If he was right in the past, he to blame
I keep the gee as the world change
So stop the hustle, I'm still the same
Live by and I die by, and drug call bull shit, I ain't never try
I keep the reality above it, nigga
While you face this, maybe I'm that good

[Hook]
It's like I'm dreaming
But my eyes are wide open
Still everything is perfect
I'm comfortable but I ain't resting
So I am hostile, just to make a living
They say that home is where the heart is
Heart of the city
