[Intro: Sticky Fingaz]

Nowadays it's easier to get a gun, than an education
That's why kids in trench coats shoot up their school
And parents outlive their kids
And sex, the thing that bring life
Also take it away
Wouldn't you say this is a wonderful world?

[Verse 1: Sticky Fingaz]

I've seen red for green
Dead soldiers too
I've seen men kill
Coulda been me or you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
I've seen guys in blue
Seize pounds of white
The rich rule in day
And the poor starve at night
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]

The serpent and the angel
So deadly in disguise
And all sorts of races
Of people drop like flies
I've seen friends snaking friends
Saying 'to Hell with you!'
Niggas be jealous
Hating on you
I've seen babies dying
Can't watch them grow
Brothers at war
In every ghetto
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

Yes I think to myself
What a wonderful world
