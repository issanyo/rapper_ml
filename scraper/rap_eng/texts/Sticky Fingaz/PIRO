[Verse 1: Skits Vicious, Jay Reaper & Dopey Rotten]
What, I don't give a fuck boy
Middle fingers up to you fuckboys
Onyx D.O.D yeah we MOB boy
D.O.P.E black rock boy
Drop boyz the illest in the ozone
No clone i be bad to the bone holmes
So stoned take a dab of the home grown
Phone home like an extraterrestrial
Out of this world bitch
Your rap shit's terrible
Talk the talk Walk the walk oh you never do
Chop your head off then i put it on a pedestal
Clean up the tools had a scheme but you never knew
You never knew and you never will know
Crack your window take that Nintendo
Ketamin flow five high five low
Oh psycho five-o die slow

Ready for the sneak attack
