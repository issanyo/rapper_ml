[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Aiyyo, we're coming in
You could feel the place rumbling
Got it tumbling
We 'gon back it up, make it come again
We're coming in
You can feel the bass rumbling
Got it tumbling
Niggas jumping up, we got it dumb again
Time to throw your guns again
Shots for the dead and gone
Niggas dead wrong took your chain
You got deaded on
Broke killers, dope dealers, what I'm repping for
Them broke niggas, that's why I keep a weapon for
I keep repping 'til I get reprimanded
Way I shoot with the left, niggas think I'm left-handed
Niggas get left stranded with the TEC-9
When I connect 9, leave your body laying to collect time
Never let nobody disrespect mine
Watch the way you walk, when you hit me on direct lines
Cause anything you say, can and will be used against you
And this that gangsta shit, that you don't wanna get into

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Fuck all this rhetoric
Gunshots let it rip
A steel plated point blank
Vest is what you better get
Death is how we settle it, fuck your confederate
20 years later same nigga, just a better whip
Y'all niggas delicate, one hit your head a split
I don't work for peanuts
I'm a tiger, not an elephant!
But for nothing I set it quick just for the hell of it!
Just to beat your ass is worse than out-of-court settlement
Ain't nothing changed but the Glock and the caliber
You funny ass niggas is not in my caliber
Coming at me crazy you get popped in the cabbage, bruh
Niggas need to stop, before I "cock back" the hammer, BUCK!
I scream so much, I type in all caps
You couldn't fuck with me, if I was writing your raps
You wouldn't know gangsta shit if it fell right in your lap
Sticky Fingaz get niggas hype and all out!!!!
