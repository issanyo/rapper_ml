[Chorus: Felisa Marisol]
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack

[Fredro Starr]
Yo America is under attack, yo Onyx is back
Took a team out the hood, the whole crew got phat
Allot of hate cos I took Hollywood on my back
Keep it crully, grimy, no positive rap
You can tell by the way I got out the projects
You still here, your thuggin with the best
Don't worry if I got nines I blast text
You should worry if ya got shine I snatch next
War for real you don't want war for real
If its real make ya timps up step up and feel
Cos real killas do real things, but not you
You americé nigga who wanna play nigga?
Take a stray nigga, get out ma way nigga
The ballheads back nobody wurse then them
Im a madface nigga in a worstagrim
Im a maceface nigga im n a [?]

[Chorus: Felisa Marisol]
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack

[Verse 2: Sonsee]
Who that, sonee, hell yeah!
Bangin' Brooklyn to Brussels to Bell Air
Shortys poppin' their brands, hoppin' out cars
Got rappers nervous, scared of droppin' their bars
Take ya though, break you, break ya ho
Nigga ain't a greater flow, I make ya new
Money better play it low, take it slow
Make the foo, keep ya face ain't a moo
I'm like mixin' liquor, I'm bound to come up on niggas
And highjack the bank abduct ya ditches
Can't fly, got a nice plan tuck to fit ya
I'll be lost a fare kid paid bucks to bitch ya
So, no, wer stoppin' wer trempin' yo scene
I'm mixin', yellow with blue, I gotta get green
Either yo with us, or not, not in between
You will show us the money when I show you the bean

[Chorus: Felisa Marisol]
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
Well it's the S-T crocked I-C-K-Y
Got ma [?] doin' for sticks back in B, K and Y
I'm livin' all in five barrels, so i'm rappin' wild
The thuggest thug in the club, who else plays high?
Been in the game for years, it made me a criminal
Your small time, ma rims is just as big as you
I've never had a nine to five
I had a nine that hit people that got off there five
From thosele shiny things, that cut trough glass
Don't even speak to me, this is about sex and cash
I like ma cars, girls and clothes only for ma models
I beat you between yo head with thousand dollar arms bottle
Can't even with ice, I carry to much heat
The combination always leaves somebody wetting the street
I'm start sellin' hope trough ma arms of weed
Cos im broke only got threehundred gram on the bank
We back, bringing you that filth from filth
Let me stop talking before I criminate myself

[Chorus: Felisa Marisol]
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
Onyx is back
And they can never, ever, ever be wack
