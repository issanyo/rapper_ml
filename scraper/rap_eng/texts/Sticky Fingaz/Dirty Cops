[Chorus (2x): Fredro Starr]
The old neighborhood screamin out dirty cops
Cause they up to no good, fuck the dirty cops
Wanna slam me on the hood, dirty cops
Tried to rob me for my rights but I know
I know my rights I know I know I know I know

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
I'm on the block with a couple racks on me
Dirty cop tried to put a couple packs on me
Use his knife stick to fuckin beat the black off me
Then I ran, bumped him made him spill his black coffee
Better back the fuck off me, I know my rights
Sais the kid had a gun and ya know that's hype
Tried to throw me on the ground on a cold ass night
But fuck a dirty, cop you know that's right
They only make like twenty three a hour
At the chinese spot, always eatin sweet and sour
This where you find the cops, in hot pursuit
Late night tryin to find a prostitute

[Chorus (the 5th line is repeated twice): Fredro Starr]

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Dirty cops is good if you pay 'em off
Cause they could kill a nigga they won't even lay him off
Tryin to plant drugs so they could send them way up north
Keep the money comin in it's like sprayin off
Cause you see, police won't bug a nigga
Won't fuck with me but put the drugs on another nigga
But miss a payment, then find yo' ass up the river
Keep my dirty cops paid off like whattup my nigga?!
If it's there word against yours, then dead it
Now you got a felony and a court case schedule
Get a good lawyer my nigga is what you better do
Should've paid the dirty cop now you in federal

[Chorus (the 5th line is repeated twice): Fredro Starr]

[Verse 3: Snak The Ripper]
Yo you dirty cops on the block watchin with binoculars
Wanna talk to us well piggy we ain't tryin to talk to ya
It's obvious you really got the low low on my shirt
Actin like you tough cause you know your a homo when it hurts
See you robbin drugs at work so you could sling 'em on the side
Pull me over with no warrant to investigate my ride
But I know my fuckin rights so I ain't lettin you inside
Every time you write a statement yo I'm bettin it you lied
You the, only motherfucker let you serve and protect
Walkin with your chest out like you deserve the respect
All the laws that you push you got the nerve to forget
Tried to arrest me for this verse cause every word is a threat
Bitch!

[Chorus (the 5th line is repeated thrice): Fredro Starr]
