[Skits Vicious]
We step in through your door and put the weapon to your jaw
I'm running through your shit while you're headed for the floor
Anything that fits gets ripped i zip lock it
P-p-pickpocket ill show you what a sick fuck is

[Jay Reaper]
I get nuggets big bricks your shit plummets
I did done it done did it your bitch gutted
I'm too rugged all my [?] ya niggas is faggots
Fuckin with the dope you get damaged

[Skits Vicious]
We the badest the ugly fuck the good
They shall perish trust me knock on wood
Evil deadish cellars
Got the book got the look got em shook
Like a seesaw sucka

[Jay Reaper]
Motherfucka i never take this shit too lightly
Just try and bite me I'ma bust back in your wifey
Precisely, this life is so pricey
Now run them new motherfuckin Nikes' nigga

[Skits Vicious]
The light beam flickers big butt strippers
Lip gloss glitters cocaine mirrors
Big buck figures, I figure you get the picture
Stick Dro Vicious and Reaper we came to rip ya

[Jay Reaper]
Stick a nigga now i got five to six figures
Sippin liquor like to get high don't lift fingers
Cuz I'm way too lazy to be bumping your shit
I need a bump and a fifth before i jump off the cliff

[Hook X2]
When you hear the guns
Bang bang bang
You will feel your ears
Ring ring ring
You know we only talk
Slang slang slang
So you can see the chains
Bling bling bling
It's triple x

[Fredro Starr]
Ey yo we sneak up in the crib and put the saws to your ribs
Niggas tryna figure how these niggas know where i live
I click clack with the strap we buck em down
Kids gets kidnapped no kidding don't fuck around
It's the griddy the grimy don't get me mad
Buck shots in your liver will have you shit in a bag
Yo i promise cross my heart hope to die
You can't kill the onyx my niggas multiply
A Madface pirate shiver me timbers
You don't wanna end up on the bottom of my Timberlands
Kick the door give me the grands
Big shotguns like I'm Yosemite Sam

[Sticky Fingaz]
I ain't scared of hell, I've been on fire before
I'm the alpha male I live inside of the floor
Niggas tattletale we'll wire wide your jaw
If I'm out on bail, I'ma bail I'm fire for sure
God in the flesh possessed by the spirit in me
Bottle my sweat n sell it as an energy drink
I don't make threats, Couldn't tell we even had beef
But you gonna regret the day you meet the demon in me
I was born triplets but I'm the lucky fool
My pop's told my mom's to pick one and drown the other two
I'm out n about nigga i ain't hard to get to
Not a word out my mouth, I let the bitch choose
Fuck rhyming its a wrap for you
I punch niggas in their face and slap them with a lawsuit
Kill you? I'm tryina keep you alive
Too see how much pain you can take before you die

[Hook X2]
When you hear the guns
Bang bang bang
You will feel your ears
Ring ring ring
You know we only talk
Slang slang slang
So you can see the chains
Bling bling bling
It's triple x
