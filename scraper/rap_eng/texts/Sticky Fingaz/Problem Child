[Intro]
Problem
You don't really want a problem
But now you motherfucking got one
Are you looking for a problem
Problem, problem, problem, problem

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
5 am cops at my door
Best go find out what they knocking for
This could be problem we couldn't afford
But they won't find the dope cause it's under the floor
Looking at my Rolly, it's about that time
Before I leave the crib I gotta cock that nine
We roll deep, need two or three sprinters
Looking like the Last Supper when we eat dinner
Paparazzi make me lose my cool
Don't try to play me cause I'm not that dude
Fuck the law cause my name ain't Jude
I'ma a born leader, I don't follow the rules

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
I got a short fuse
My sticky fingers, I leave your face bruised
Who can pay when a nigga pay dues
Ain't no way, ain't no way we can lose
I'm a watermelon, chicken eating, blunt smoking, Henny drinking
Gun toting, always creeping, dice rolling, now we scheming
Might blow for any reason
Eyes low [?]
Double crossing, don't believe it
Still battling inner demons

[Pre-Hook]
Hold it now
Hold it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
When we come down, terrorizing your town
Running with my wolves and we out on the prowl
If you didn't know it, you knowing it now
I'll always be a motherfucking problem child
We the ones everyone warned you about
Better stay clear when you see us around
If you didn't know it, you knowing it now
I'll always be a motherfucking problem child

[Verse 3: Fredro Starr]
Onyx coming through, we raising hell
Just saw the devil, we blazed the L
A few of us spent a couple days in jail
We using tour money to raise the bail
Everywhere I go, you know I got the crew with me
The boy keep it 100 like two 50's
Weed in the telly, that's another 250
Wet towels at the door but the weed was too piffy

[Verse 4: Sticky Fingaz]
I'm a problem child, I be throwing tantrums
Drank too much and threw up in the Phantom
I'm known for coming up with anthems
That make niggas start throwing up their handguns
Don't get my way, I start stomping my feet
Having a fit, breaking everything in my reach
I gotta breath deep and count to ten
1, 2, 3 fuck that shit

[Pre-Hook]
Hold it now
Hold it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
When we come down, terrorizing your town
Running with my wolves and we out on the prowl
If you didn't know it, you knowing it now
I'll always be a motherfucking problem child
We the ones everyone warned you about
Better stay clear when you see us around
If you didn't know it, you knowing it now
I'll always be a motherfucking problem child

[Outro]
Problem
You don't really want a problem
But now you motherfucking got one
Are you looking for a problem
Problem, problem, problem, problem
Problem
You don't really want a problem
But now you motherfucking got one
Are you looking for a problem
Problem, problem, problem, problem
