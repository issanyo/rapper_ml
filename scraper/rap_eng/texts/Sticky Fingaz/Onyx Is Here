(Onyx, Onyx..) Move back ... (the Onyx is here!)
Back up, back up (the Onyx is here!)

Chorus: Onyx (repeat 2X)

(Onyx, Onyx..) Move back .. the Onyx is here!
Back up, back up .. the Onyx is here!

[Fredro Starr]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah make way for the wild child
Stop screamin, you're fiendin
Play that, say that, dip dive socialize
Uncivilized guys rise up
Hip hop underrated the way they stated gets me hated
Back up, back off, lick shot for the street smarts
Onyx is the antidote for all your problems
Gimme a hit
Damn, don't it feel good

[Sonee Seeza/Sonsee]
Yup, I know you love to hate it, but you cannot explain
Why you keep puttin madface in your veins
Oooh, yeah, there, I got it
Afficial Nastee psychotic

[Fredro Starr]
Spies got spotted
So travel through the mind of a maniac automatic
You panic get stranded, a nigga on the planet

[Sonee Seeza/Sonsee]
Feel the black stone hit ya dome, roam in the desert
My chrome fills and skills to put chills in ya backbone

Chorus 2X

[Fredro & Sonsee]
1-to-the-9-to-the-9-to-the-3, solid as a rock!
So back up off the block, blow up the spot
So left-right-left-right
Take it to the center, and enter
The black reign domain, a plane you never been to
And you know what this is what?
Face down on the floor
Give me it all, I got they back against the wall

Chorus 2X

[Sticky Fingaz]
Don't be afraid, you'll only lose your life that way
I'm an endangered species, surprised to live to see today
But if you're readin between the enemy line you'll find I'm insane
Too much strain on the brain, capable to pop a vein
So I'ma do-it do-it do-it do-it do it like this
Now Onyx is here, so back up or get dissed
And if you put me to the test, I'll lay you to rest
Bring it right to his chest, put it straight through his vest

Chorus 2.5X

Back, UP!!!  Onyx is here..
