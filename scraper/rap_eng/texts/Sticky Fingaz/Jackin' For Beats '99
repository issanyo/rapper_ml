Several different beats are used in this song
Like Ice Cube's "Jacking For Beats"

[Verse 1]
(Sticky) What's my muthafuckin' name?
(Fingaz) And who I'm rollin' with?
(All my killas) Uh, uh, uh, labels better get it right
Rappers better gimme that beat, fool
You been jacked now
You ain't heard? Sticky Fingaz on ya track now
Somebody said you number one in the streets
That's why I'm coming for you first, jackin' your beat
I took ya beat and rearranged it on some thug shit
Got robbed on the radio in broad day, public
The thugs loved it, it's not a game
Went solo on that ass but it's still the same

[Verse 2]
Beat robba, robba
Jackin' rappers' beats and make 'em hotta, hotta
Stealin' all ya spins plus ya dollas, dollas
Killas if you feel me just folla, folla, what? Come on!
Take it to the streets hold ya gats and bust the heat
Even if it's off your plate, I gots to eat
I'm on some bullshit for no apparent reason
I want it wit' y'all, I'm ready to die breathin'

["Hate Me Now" by Nas]
It's the rappers I rob, the beats that I take, the labels I snake
For thirty grand I'll perform at your wake
Touch ya life and everything I touch I take
Hate me now ‘cause later gon' be too late
I merk you, everything that I spit is controversial
I'm the illest killa they ever signed to Universal
F the stardom, I'm God's son
As soon as they blink, bet ya bottom dolla, I'm gon' rob 'em

["How to Rob" by 50 Cent]
My sticky fingers turn fists across ya jaw
Beat ya ass in real life at the Source Awards
The real 50 from Brooklyn, God bless, he got outed
You just a fake clown that front and rap about it
I got a new deal for a few mil, shoot to kill
You fruity like Dru Hill, you spare change
You ain't even half a mans, cuz
Matter of fact, you ain't even half the mans ya moms was

["Ha" by Juvenile]
Oh you thought you was safe, ha
Though you could escape, ha, ‘cause we label mates, ha
Oh you thought I wasn't get yo' tape, ha
Thought that beat from the dirty south wasn't gon' get raped, ha
And birds wanna have Sticky baby, ha
Dogs run around sayin' Sticky crazy, ha
He ain't got no type of sense, ha
No tellin' what I do, even jack my own crew

["Throw Ya Gunz" by Onyx]
The original take 'em out, bring 'em out dead
Coming at me wrong, kid, I put this thing to ya head
Sticky Fingaz going for self, call the cops
Don't even talk to me about the Onyx shit, you'll get shot

["Play Around" by Lil' Cease]
Five o'clock in the morning, killas at ya door
Chrome 4-4, cops putting chalk on your floor
Find you up the block from your house, dead in the store
Run through beats like pigeons and I'm pluckin' 'em all
Press your luck and you'll fall, never seen nothing this raw
I'm what the world been waitin' for
Wait no more, this wack shit, I can't take no more
Should've been banned, the streets should've made it a law

["What Ya Want" by Eve]
I'm ready for war, what y'all niggas want
(What, what, what, bring it) You can't touch
All y'all niggas sweet
Even rob Swizz Beats
Nowadays, producers getting fifty G's
Jack they beat, kid, I get my track for free
Jerk you for ya pub, I ain't payin' a fee
I just loop it up on the MPC

["Party Is Goin' On Over Here" by Busta Rhymes]
Long as you live, never seen nothing this hot
Took ya beat and flipped it, writtin' my style
Just payin' back, niggas be bitin' my style
And if it's dead in the crowd I put some life in the crowd
God's gift to the underground, runnin' 'em down
Gunnin' 'em down, empires come tumblin' down
The end of the world is comin' around, throw ya guns in the ground
Nothing to lose, changin' the rules, playin' for keeps
A shark in these waters, it ain't safe in the streets
It's Sticky Fingaz and I'm jackin' for beats
