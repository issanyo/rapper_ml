Come here girl {*laughter*}

[Hook]
No more stunts no more lies
No more bitches in my ride
No more allnight parties all leave it behind
No more freaks living right
No more drama in the life
From now on its me and my lady just me and my baby

[Sticky Fingaz]
It starts going on tour the first time
Imagine the thoughts going threw a young rappers mind
Knowing your mine and couldn't give a fuck if you leaved
Things I did its hard for my self to believe
That that I'm sitting back thinking about smoking these trees
Girl you right I'm damn near ruined your life
The only one that was there at the end of the night
My vision was wrong guess what my bitch is gone
And you dont want me now that's why I'm flipping this song
Ignoring my calls dayly fuckers you trying to scare me
Talking on the machine acting like you you can't hear me
Thuggin it out to much I think its rap
Sending you gifts but god damn you sending them back
Killing myself like I ain't got know prize
Seeing your your face every time I close my eyes
Damn girl don't let this be the end of the ride

[Hook]

[Sticky Fingaz]
I've been around the world seen the best of woman
Bitches liking my style I guess it's the thug in them
I'm just living my life with no time to talk to them
Tired of dissing my wife cuz niggas we all do it
Hoes calling my cell you cursing about crazy
Got to know that you hate me probably ready to snake me
Like pulling up to the club one night
In my benz with your friends and about to get right
Them birds they got nerve filling my mouth with words
Telling you that I don't car all night they in ya ear
Fuck wat am I suppose to do I'm miles away from home
Heard in your voice your feelings over the phone
Thoose nights we had fights I tried to keep it calm
Throwing my shit outside on the front lawn
I ain't want when I had you  now I need you that your gone (damn girl)

[Hook]

Just me and my lady

Just me and my baby
