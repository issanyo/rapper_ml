[Hook: August Alsina]
Seems like the more shit change
More stay the same
Niggas still out tryin' to get paid
Hoes still act strange for the change
Cuz I stay pimp tight, when I get right
Smoke good, drink all night
Tryin' to get laid
Shawty swing it my way
Swing it my way, shawty swing it my way
Swing it my way, shawty swing it my way
Cuz I'm pimp tight, while I get right
Smoke good, drink all night
It's time to get paid shawty, swing it my way

[Verse 1: Rocky Diamonds]
It's M.O.B and she fuck with me
And I fuck with her
And she know she's the shit too
See them other bitches can't fuck with her
If she act right and her back right
I Ferragamo her whole life
Balenciaga her whole closet
And we goin' in like bank deposits
She's been my homie since high school
The only one that gave a fuck
When the fame come, no changing her
I'm the same nigga since day one

[Hook: Rocky Diamonds]
She come first like day one
When the problems came, she ain't run
She automatic like machine guns
She knows she could never leave Young

[Verse 2: Rocky Diamonds]
I hit that shit like home runs
I'm up to bat, blowing thrax
Ima young P, you can ask the hood
I sold pussy, I ain't have to jugg
Cuz it's M.O.B and she understands
All my hoes stay on the pole
All my hoes bring Rico dough
If you hold me down then them hoes is yours
Cuz Ima real nigga, that's real shit
Bring some pussy back to the private
When it comes to fashion, I got foreign options
We don't fuck with ya'll, no ours is poppin

[Hook: Rocky Diamonds]
She come first like day one
When the problems came, she ain't run
She automatic like machine guns
She knows she could never leave Young
