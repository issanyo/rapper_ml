[Fredro Starr]
You roll a hundred niggas deep but not one of ya got a gun
I bust one shot, you see a hundred niggas run
Dressed in all black Gore-tex  with four teks
We all war vets, I’m takin all bets to see who can score nex
I burn you like raw sex, you just a small threat
Wit a small set, so forfeit, I'm out for more checks
Cuz whatever that it takes to make these papes, I'mma walk this
I'm worthless, I'm back to sellin cracks behind the churches
I hurt this when I work this, I’ll beat you fuckin senseless
Cause sleepin on the benches got me swingin at the fences
I bring it down like gravity with a ghetto mentality
To feel the agony of the Afficial Nastee Armee strategy

[Greg Valentine]
The city never sleeps, so don't sleep on us
I put niggas to rust when my gun bust and plus you get rushed
And when the pressure’s on you just bitch up
If you had plans on conquering this you need to switch up
Get up
Nigga you shoulda got up, obey my orders cause shit like that’ll leave you shot up
It’s a dead man’s party leave your body at the door
Unlawful entry, my introduction to the century
An entity is what I plan to be in the industry, enemies in my vicinities
Get assassinated like a Kennedy, my gat's the foolproof remedy

[Sonsee]
It’s Sonsee, black, I’m pullin ya bad news out the pocket of my khaki’s
Attack me you get splashed; Afficial Nastee back me
So what the fuck is wrong with your dumb ass?
Trying to put shit on our name, you gonna get numb fast
This rap industry can do without ya
But I’ll haul off and smack the dog shit out ya
Look and see my image again when you start hemorrhaging the deal
It’s cloggin up what? The blood he didn’t spill
It’s massive, disastrous, plenty closed caskets
And as this world turn we burn crews to ashes
Niggas tanks is empty, so get gassed up and smashed up
That’s my word! Come with that bullshit and that’s that ass yup

[Hook 8X]
Getto mentalitee

[J Mega]
I trash niggas who can’t speak what I’m sayin
All City, Mega bomb, I ain’t playin
Just slayin emcees and makin niggas freeze with all these lyrics for me to squeeze
Niggas please don’t test me, just let me be with my city
Nastee, Officially keepin niggas wit me to hit me with the Ballantine  40’s
And bag the bad shorties
I got drafted because the fuckin Armee caught me
And it’s all out war, niggas fall out for reasons now known
Check this shit, I got the illest, the realist, hard for kids to kill this
Until it’s, my turn to fall I’ma fill this brick wall to keep the crabs out of my sector
Injector, and I’m correct the J Mega

[Panama P.I.]
The hell with wounds, I won’t leave a scratch to patch
This is war, way worse than a grudge match
Big P.I., no one’s bolder, a universal solider
Chump, shoulda listen when I told ya
I'm ill, like fire marshall Bill, insane
Flip, squash and kill lyrics burn like acid rain
Born in the gutter, buck wild, far from butter
A bugged thug I used to mug with the rug cutter
Rugged and raw, gritty cause I’m hardcore
More mighty than Thor, always aiming for a faggot jaw
So hard rocks that’s fillin’ flocks, clear the block
My mic’s a Glock, I keep plenty styles in stock
The way emcees react when I attack
Get me away from him, he’s a maniac

[Sticky Fingaz]
It's a conspiracy, I've been framed
They call me Nigga so much, startin to think it's my name
Light skinned and ashamed, cuz way back in the days
They raped my grandmother's mothers, when they was enslaved
They hung my grandfather if he misbehaved
But my ancestors was brave and most of them real
Stronghard black sweaty slaves workin in the fields
Four hundred years later, I learned about my roots
And how they traded in they white sheets, for badges and blue suits
So I’m taking recruits to set the fuckin score right and start a fight
A fight, a nigga and a white, and if the nigga don’t win then we all jump in
