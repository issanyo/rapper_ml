One time One time...thats it
Yeeeaaahhh
This the Onyx shit know what I'm sayin
Coming out the mother fucking crevices
Coming out the fucking cracks like snakes boy
Word to mother
All my niggas in Queens and ya dont stop
All my niggas in Brooklyn and ya dont stop
All my niggas Uptown and ya dont stop
All my niggas in the boogiewoogie and ya won't stop
We gonna set this shit New York style


[Fredro]
We don't throw gang signs in New York
We just be on some shit in New York
New York City, shiftee low down gritty
You punk niggas yell pity and smell shitty
NYPD can suck my dick
This is the way we rip shit from the bricks
Walking like a zombie smoking blunts in the lobby
I  be rollin with more niggas behind me than Khadafi

[Sonsee]
Attention, fuck all that slippin and itchin
I’m rappin, loot snachin, stayin greasy this shit ain’t easy
I’m comin rawhide, serious as a four five
Them damn streets are eager to claim all lives
But fuck it, it’s my home hate it or appreciate it
It’s the torrid 8 million story orientated
Designated and made for the real renegades
So I never been afraid to stomp, comp, then get paid

[Hook]
This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way we walk in New York
This is the way we walk in New York

[Sonsee]
I’ma stay on my job, cause that’s my adventure
I was bred to be a big gainer who contained a precent of the
U.S.G. which make me switch like a schizo
Where I roam it gets so hot but never blow my cool at no spot
If the heat got too much I’ma slide down south
Outta town bound, either home or away
New York hold shit down on keep locked  we rock all night
And if Zoo York niggas wasn’t part of your shit, your shit wasn’t right
We known to start shit up from trends, to riots, to fracas
And big enough to fuck up anybody that wanna attack us
And that’s cause the five boroughs are deep
Most of us are peeps, true Zoo York niggas we play for keeps

(Wanna be a part of it--New york is always starting shit)

[Fredro Starr]
Fuck that, I’m the nasty native New Yorker
The full of shit talker
The dark street walker
Sign of the time stalker
Bringin it back to reality, this is for my niggas in NYC
Not since '76
Since the Knicks won the championships
Has there been some more shit like this
So back up, get off of that soft or wack rap style
My shots ring loud, and panic the crowd
Blowin’ up
Get up, my sounds downtown
Hold ‘em up
Give me everything right now
So fuck the mayor, fuck Rudy, Ray, and the governor
Ya’ll niggas couldn’t walk my walk, my talk’s ruggeder

[Hook]

[Sticky Fingaz]
Yeah, I’m from the place where criminals is born
And Sticky Fingaz ain’t never led a nigga wrong
Representin New York City and for what it’s worth
Yo we the triflest mother fuckers on the face of this Earth
So if you don’t like your life fuck with a nigga from New York
The instincts we got is to shoot first then talk
But what seems to always gives us away is our "niggery" walk
And I speak from experience, so pleader take heed to advice
We sellin guns and drugs and sex or anything for the right price
The crime rate’s so goddamn high, we had to name the shit twice
Cause tourists be scared to death to visit the criminal’s paradise
Home of bloodshed and tears and for souvenirs there’s fears
It appears nobody cares so say your prayers
Or you gonna get double crossed and set up, either head up or shut up
Cause bullets ain’t got no names and anybody could get wet up
And end up on the front page of the Daily News papers
But while crooks dressed in Brooks and behind  desks in skyscrapers
And I never bought no shit, but then I never took no shit
I’m a kleptomaniac, I think I got a fuckin' habit
So lick shot to all the boroughs and ghettos across the nation
Other states who could relate get bullet proof appreciation
Cause
