Come on, yeah
I don't know man, fuck that
I ain't going back, shit, you know what I'm saying?
I ain't getting caught up in that nest of shit, man
This bitch done caught a nigga, you know what I'm saying?
I did what I had to up in there
That-that-that-that-that bodega right there, but fuck that
Gotta get this money right here, man
I'm not going back
Shit, I'm not going back
I ain't getting silly over this bullshit right here, you know what I mean?
My motherfucking name is Kirk Jones, you know what I mean?
Shit... I'd die for this right here before I go back there
