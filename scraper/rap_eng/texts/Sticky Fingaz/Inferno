[Intro: Remy Ma]
Burn it, burn it up, now burn it up
Burn it, burn it up, yeah, burn it up
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
Blow torch, furnace, matches, lighters
Candles, ovens, electrical wires
Petroleum, lava, charcoal, stars
They're all on fire, just like Remy Ma, now
Hip-Hop and R&B, yeah, I be blazin' that
Acapella, instrumental, either way I'm flamin' that
H.E.L.L, that's where they made me at
An artist, an arsonist, I'm a pyromaniac
Exploded on the scene, then I heat up, I baked it
The chimney on the roof, I'm the boiler in the basement
I'm flat and still when it comes to the basics
My body made out the same material your safe is
All hail to the King, bow down, kiss the ring
We about to blow it up, nitroglycerine
Never roll, we out of here, places that you never been
When I say we takin' over, that means we takin' everythin'

[Chorus: Remy Ma]
We gon' make it hot like inferno
You gonna have to open up a window
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah
Burn it, burn it up, now burn it up
Burn it, burn it up, yeah, burn it up
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Picture me without fireworks for lungs
See forth brains, I nitroglycerine for a tongue
Temperature risin' as soon as I hit the road
It's electrical, my biometric be long and hell's too
The moment I felt gasoline in the attic
Remy went to the basement to get us a box of matches
I'm swivelin', turn the flame, no worry, we dressed to match
We need to bury 'em only ashes, aside the casket (ayy)
Smokin' ashes, no, it ain't over
We still got blow torches, the flame thrower
The rap of the city must over fire
Straight lines for mines, pow, holds the front page

[Verse 3: Remy Ma]
Remy true to your face, ignite your grills
See I'm a fire starter, you a fire a drill
Told ya I'm the truth and you lyin' still
I mean, you can't move, you lyin' still
I'm sick, it's bad and I'm a rapper
I'm ill, I went to the pyro-practer
He said ,"Rem you got a fever, you too hot ain't no one touchin' you" (she got third-degree burns)
And you hardly combustible (burn)

[Chorus: Remy Ma]
We gon' make it hot like inferno (burn)
You gonna have to open up a window (burn)
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah
We gon' make it hot like inferno (burn)
You gonna have to open up a window (burn)
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah
Burn it, burn it up, now burn it up
Burn it, burn it up, yeah, burn it up
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah
We gon' bring that fire, yeah, yeah
