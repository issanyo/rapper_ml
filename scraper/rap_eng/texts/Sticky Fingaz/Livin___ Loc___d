[Bo$$]
Broke as a God damn joke
Up in Detroit and once again I'm just a few.. short
Couple of hundred bucks so fuck the rent
My share of that shit got spent on some Newports
So yankin, many motherfuckers is my new.. sport
I'm ready to blast and kill for a rap deal
Fuck the landlord and the gas bill, we don't give a fuck
We thinkin shit of livin shabby
Waited until my cash got right then took a flight to Cali
Off into the night, me and Dee up into mo' hell
Got into some shit befo' we even reached the hotel (God damn!)
Fuck the dumb shit, gotta get rich at the same time
Cause niggas steady throwin up they gang sign
No loot, no more palm trees, no more calm breeze
But it's cool deez bitches bout to slang ki's
So on my hip goes a pager, (?) major
It's two bad behavior bitches that got gangsta flavor
See a punk KILL A PUNK and then we (?) quick
Out to get paid, motherfuck this strugglin shit
Bullshit's nothin to a bitch with no emotions
(Tell 'em how the fuck you livin) I'm livin like loc'n

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
Livin loc'd, livin livin loc'd (yo how the FUCK we livin?)
Livin loc'd (BITCH NIGGAZ GET SMOKED) (fuck dat!)
Livin loc'd, livin livin loc'd (we livin.. uh-huh)
Livin loc'd .. mother-fuckers!
Livin loc'd, livin livin loc'd (FUCK! We livin)
Livin loc'd (BITCH NIGGAZ GET SMOKED) (uh-huh!)
Livin loc'd, livin livin loc'd
Yeah and all the bitch-ass niggas can suck my dick!

[Bo$$]
Buck buck!  Then I let the trigger loose
Motherfuckers better duck, but it ain't no god damn duck duck goose
Haven't you heard of this murderous bitch, crawlin slow
And puttin lead to the, head of my foes on the down low
Cause all we got we fuckin tooken it
Got a double-bunk and now we roll, fuck footin it
Cruisin down the 'Shaw, smokin joints, cause we blaze weed
Down to (?) spot, cluckers kickin in their Daisies 'n shit
Cause niggas'll never drop the dirt, do we're layin niggas on they back
Then actin like we never even fuckin knew ya
Unload the clip off in your chest, take a deep breath
God damn!  What a motherfuckin bloody mess
Sleepin on benches, turned us into roguest bitches
We jumpin fences from the feds through puddles and ditches
Goin out, don't give a fuck if I get smoked
Yo (shh..) at least I'm goin out loc'd

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
Livin loc'd, livin livin loc'd (how we livin?)
Livin loc'd, livin livin loc'd (word up!)
Livin loc'd, livin livin loc'd (yo, how we livin?)
Livin loc'd, livin livin loc'd (fuck that!)
Livin loc'd, livin livin loc'd (We livin)
Livin loc'd (BITCH NIGGAZ GET SMOKED)

[Bo$$]
Livin loc'd.. and for any bitch beefin then the Bo$$'ll have to put a
Ass full of my FOOT for fuckin with the butchers
Fuck next, steppin with gauge upon my hip, weapon
Nine double M's for the one-eighty-seven
Cause I'm nothin but a mag totin bitch, smokin fifty bags
Rollin niggas up like the MOTHERFUCKIN zig zag!
Understand this bitch never (?) mine
Or catch two into your chest with the tec-9
Cause ever since the days, of way back
It never played to let the get go, rat-a-tat-tat-tat
I fill gats so how the fuck you figure nigga
Put you in kill range 'til you feel pain from the trigga nigga
When gangsta bitches just can't cope
Niggas are getttin smoked nine-trey and forever, livin life loc'd

[Sticky Fingaz]
It's the motherfuckin Bo$$!
