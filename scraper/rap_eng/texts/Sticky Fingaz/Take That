[Sticky Fingaz]
Seem like the only thoughts that's good be negative
A shit I never give, I need a sedative
I'mma forever live, the one and only, murder rap
Defeat, I never heard of that
Push ya head further back kid and that's word to gat
The most quotable, a number two of niggas when there's a show to do
You know the truth, Official Nast niggas, I blow a hole in you
I'm sellin tracks not cracks, you buyin or what?
Cuz I could be in your crib right now, tyin you up
Cold ramshack ya house, put the gun in your spouse mouth
And clean the place, kill the kids too they seen my face
It's the cream I chase, anything get in my way bein erased
We the ministers who raise the most hell
Onyx in the Bible, Genesis 2, verse 12
And uh, that's the life that I lead
Niggas walk around town like they can't bleed
So take that, where your heart is at
So take that, yeah, what
Take that and that and that and that and that and that
