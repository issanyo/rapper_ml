(featuring Dave Hollister)

[Sticky talking]
Let me call this nigga
Come on man; pick up the damn phone

[Brother]
Hello

[Sticky]
I got your pictures, damn we look just alike
A younger version of me, half my age same height
I played "beat you up", made you tough, thought you to fight
Put you on, showed you things, put up your first bite
Now you on the streets making the same mistakes I did
That got me nowhere, so I'm trapped upstate in this bid
Caged like an animal ain't no way to live
Got a baby on the way, who gone father my kid
Where you going now I can clearly see
You either going in an bag or in jail with me
Remember when we was younger and you promised me
You be the first in our fam with al college degree
I know you see the cars, the girls, the clothes, the jewels
And think it's all about the money, heard you dropped out of school
I ain't trying preach but if I don't, who gonna
Couldn't live with myself if you died on the corner
You're my baby brother

[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
You are my baby brother
And you know I love you nigga
I'm just trying to keep you out there
You don't want to end up in here

[Brother]
I hear what you saying big brother, but listen to me
I ain't trying to be the nigga working Mickey D
When I can hustle on the block and come home with a gee
Yeah you right I want jewels and push a luxury V
But what's wrong with that, I wanna love comfortably
Just like the next man driving round the hood in my Lex Land
I ain't got nobody taking care of me
And as far as a school, well it just ain't for me

[Sticky & Brother]
So what you wanna do huh
What you gone sell drugs all your life
(I might)
See you ain't even right
Maybe when you sober up to see the light
(Hold up, this is my life, I live it anyway that I like)
Yo look I'm just trying to help
You know all you want to do is get blunted
(I need money, my wifey got a seed in her stomach)
If you can't see the cycle then you must be blind
And your child getting a father that was just like mine
You're my baby brother

Chorus

[Sticky & Brother]
So is you like that. I mean what's the deal?
Don't you too worry about trying to keep it real?
(Man whatever, this is how you feel then this how you feel)
Yo what's this I hear, you had a gun concealed
(Yeah, I keep my nine (See this what I?)
(Hold up, let me speak my mind
Look at you, you can't even talk you doing mad time)
Yeah look at me, this is how you wanna be
Locked up, the cops tell you where you can pee
(I got to go man)
Ooh you don't even want to hear me out?
(Yeah, but you talking mad shit I don't even care about)
All I saying is that you got to be more responsible
(Aight man, whatever I'm a talk to you)

[Sticky]
Yo, yo.... Damn
He gone end up just like me

Chorus
