Came from sex and aids
Now I got them all [?]
[?]
Tell people I’m good now
They say we don’t belief
The front grill on that Maserati looks evil
I swear to god I was one step in a [?]
That’s executive speech so I’m back at the [?]
When things get bad
Remember they could be worse
I mean it could be better
But it can always be worse
It’s that grown men shit nigga
I pay my taxes
My gun registered don’t need to hide it in my mattress
I came from the dessert
Sticky niggas like catfish
And I have been almost anywhere you can name on a atlas
Last night I had a nightmare
I dreamed I was broke
- talking penniless on the streets with no hope
Then I was back at the mansion when I awoke
And some bad bitch I barely know givin’ me dope
It’s on now

Yeah… yo
From that basement in queens we get Franks and Beans
Now we taking major money out the bank we kings
The deals on the table
Couple milfs for the label
Couple flat screens
No more stealin' free cable
Used to bust down on cigarette to smoke
Now we blow and smoke in cigarette boats
I been to hell and back
This close to sellin’ crack
I made my own way
When you see the judge, tell him that
Purple rain I heard you paying
This drive shit make me wanna Kurt Cobain
I never thought we make it [?]
Now the crew looking we paid the full album cover
Pissing in the driveway and drived for days
[?]
This is how I was raised
That’s how I hazed in that great swisher
Mad face – when I take a bitch [?]
It’s on now
It’s on now
When you will find it, slow down
Slow down, slow down
