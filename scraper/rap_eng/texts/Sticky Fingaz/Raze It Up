[Intro: Sticky Fingaz]
Official Nast takeover

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz, sample]
Official Nast comin' through better raze it up!
All my hoods' on the block better raze it up!
All my peoples locked up better raze it up!
You better raze it up! You better raze it up!

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Lyrical Assault, mics outlined in chalk
Gun Talk, homicide in New York
Caught a raw deal, horror Amityville
Hand me the steel, breathe and ya man'll be killed
Put a knife to the love of ya life, put a slug in ya wife
Blood on ya ice, mud on my knife
Drug price, chain snatch cocaine crack
Goin they jacks with the gat blow ya brains back
Switchin' lanes and drop vests, blow the top of the jet
Cock and wet you rocked for death
Driveby's pain in eyes painting black lines
(All the way live!) Guns in the sky, move and die
Survivin' niggas leave you left for death, one in ya head
Runnin' from Feds, drugs under ya bed
Crime kills blast rhyme skills like nine mills
So nigga dead cause I kill so what

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz, sample]
Official Naz comin' through better raze it up!
All my hoods' on the block better raze it up!
All my peoples locked up better raze it up!
You better raze it up! You better raze it up!
Official Naz comin' through better raze it up!
All my hoods' on the block better raze it up!
All my peoples locked up better raze it up!
You better raze it up! You better raze it up!

[Verse 2: Sonee Seeza]
(Right now!) We gonna hit you up with the joints
(Like bow!) Blast nasty, fight foul
Styles takin' you to the bank. Me crew always pack shanks?
Lick that clit in a 600 Benz tint
(These degrees is hot!) MC's get got
Comin to tangle from wild angles, get mangled
Buck fifty game is blow you, till ya moms won't know you
It take 2 cheap niggas just to sell you
(Uh oh! Uh oh!) Its arrested then, me and my crew
It won't be beautiful, all that shit you talk is new to who
(Believe that!) Words hit you like a semi-gat
Any act, unaccordingly (Wait!) gimme that
So core tight it was house, complicated in death
Me and my killers still here and your ass is out
We up out the gutters and let you get touched
Its such, blood rush, raze it up!

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz, sample]
Official Naz comin' through better raze it up!
All my hoods' on the block better raze it up!
All my peoples locked up better raze it up!
You better raze it up! You better raze it up!
Official Naz comin' through better raze it up!
All my hoods' on the block better raze it up!
All my peoples locked up better raze it up!
You better raze it up! You better raze it up!

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
Sticky Fingaz, madman, tear down stages
Ain't nobody dead or alive who could get with me and my rages
Throw my clip in a gat and I'm sick of this yap and I'm ready to bust a cap
And if you happen. Ya niggas will get shot fuck the rap
Get ya ass kicked, set you up or get you blasted
(Closed gasket!) I'm the bald headed bastard
(Black dust!) Gave me black lungs, I pack guns
I'm used to action like dodgin' bullets over crack funds
(Reaction!) Blaze the mack 10, shogun
I could spot the sheisty villains cause it take one to know one
Remove my mask and reveal myself
Heal Myself, if I was you I would kill myself
So play dead eyes stay red, spray lead
I'm way fed and ain't leaving without they head
Son holders they bout to get roughed up (What!)
When you see me all you hear is (Buck! Buck! Buck! Buck!)

[Bridge: Sticky Fingaz]
Official Naz comin' through better raze it up!
All my shorties in the spot better raze it up!
If you don't wanna get shot better raze it up!
You better raze it up! You better raze it up!
Official Naz comin' through better raze it up!
When you see cops comin' better raze it up!
Ease Coast, West Coast better raze it up!
You better raze it up! You better raze it up!

[Outro: scratches sample]
Word up! Raze it up!
We do it with the crew that pow! pow! pow! Come on!
Word up! Raze it up!
We do it with the crew that pow! pow! pow! Come on!
Word up! Raze it up!
