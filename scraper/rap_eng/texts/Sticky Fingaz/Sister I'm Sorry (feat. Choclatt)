Sticky Fingaz f/ Choclatt

[Sticky Fingaz - Talking]
I think one right here...
Is long over due
All ya'll
All ya'll

To all my sisters all across the world
[Sticky Fingaz]
I applaud you
I know nothing can't erase the pain we caused you
I'm sorry sister for all the times we used you
Hurt you, beat you up, bad and abused you
Raped you, took your womanhood, violated you
Betrayed you, you women, we supposed to praise you
Instead we called you hoes and bitches and dissed ya
I was thinking "Damn, what if that was my mother or my sister?"
You never feel it, till it hits home
We abandoned you, left you all alone
With our babies in your hour of need
Left you all by yourself to raise our seed
And all the times we made you go wild in court
And had to fight us just to get child support
Its only a handful of us that handle our responsibility
I'm from a broken home; you know this shit is killing me
How a man can make a woman a mother and a father
If men got it hard, then women got it harder
And I represent every man on earth when I say this:
Sister I'm sorry and I pray for your forgiveness

Sister I'm sorry

[Chorus- Choclatt]
For all the wrong I've done
Sister I'm sorry
Sister I'm sorry

I'm telling everyone
Sister I'm sorry
Nothing can change the past
Your forgiveness is all I ask

I broke a promise, cheated on you, lied to you
[Sticky Fingaz]
I ain't recognize the goddess thats inside of you
I know sorry ain't do it but my acts of faith
But I don't understand is how we could hit our girl
Made me over-stare, hope it's not to late
And how we can bring a bastard kid in this world
I don't want my child being ashamed of me
Swear to life I don't know how ya'll made it all these years
Like "Mommy, where's daddy?" Wonder what became of me
Can't even look you in your eyes without mine filling with tears
You my sister, I respect and love you
And he came from she
You woman, men came from you
Sister I'm sorry, swear to god, please forgive me
All men ain't the man that they claim to be

[Chorus]
Sister, I'm so sorry
[Choclatt]
Please forgive me

[Chorus] x2
I'm so sorry for hurting you
I'm so sorry
For mistreating you
For not loving you
I'm so sorry
