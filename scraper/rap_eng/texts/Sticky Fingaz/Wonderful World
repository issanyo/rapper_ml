Now a days it's easier to get a gun than a education
That's why kids in trench coats shoot up they schools
And parents out live they kids
And sex, the thing that bring life also take it away
When you say this is a wonderful world, ha-ha-ha-ha

(Sticky Fingaz)
I've seen trees of green, red roses too
I seen 'em bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I've seen skys of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day
The dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What are wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I've seen friends shaking hands
Sayin' How do you do?
They're really sayin' "I love you"
I hear babies cryin'
I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Ohh, yeahhh
