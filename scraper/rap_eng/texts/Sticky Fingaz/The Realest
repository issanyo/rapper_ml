[Hook]
Who's the realest, is it you? (Yeah, yeah!) [x8]

[Verse 1 - Fredro Starr]
It’s that time we about to licked off
Let off the ratchets, full metal jackets
Blow your head off backwards, attack with everything
Get that Mac and let it ring like bill collectors
I'm a mass murderer what a killed the records
With a fifty round trump feel what did It dump dumbs
Every nigga on the run in the city that I'm from
We catchin' wreck on wreck through rush hour
You don't want niggas like us to get power
We rush cowards in the back, with crushed flowers
United we stand, divided we fall
Hammers a draw, man down, man on the floor

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Sticky Fingaz]
Trigger Louis the 13th make me feel like a king
We wearing brass knuckles like a four finger ring
Got goons on deck to take one for the team
Stick you for everything nigga, even your dreams
Wanna know who’s the illest? Take a look in my eyes
When you wake up with nothing don't be surprised
Rather hate you for the truth than love you for the lies
I'll take you to the booth, that's where everybody dies
There’s so much dirt I get waste to dripping mud
In the hood niggas grimey money thicker than blood
Get murked over pennies, nickels, and dubs
I’m Bogart in the game we the illest niggas alive!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Who's the illest in here?
