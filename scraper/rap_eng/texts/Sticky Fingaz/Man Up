[Intro]
The Foundation!
C'mon, shit, Nigga what?
Blasting Niggas Son!
Ok

[Verse 1]
Ain't near a nigga out here that say i ain't got it
Bogart the game, Nigga im too Brolic
Who gon' stop me from going in your wallet?
Who gon' stop me when I turn violent?
Nobody,  You can call all your dawgs
They ain't nothing that a few funerals won't solve
Im trying to be good, Niggas just made me hard
Killing easy for a man with no faith in god
I got too much guts, Too much guns
I hold too much weight, I've seen too much, too young
Got too many niggas that will wet you up
Too many bitches That will fuck you and set you up
I'm after every Unit, Squad ,Clique, Fam or Crew
I'm so hungry, these niggas starting to look like food
You could be a country bammer and Big City Slick
I'll Rip any nigga drop him at the hood when i'm finished

[Chorus](x2)
A yo These niggas ain't fucking with me
I got too much heart i got too much heat
I'm bout to make it hard for these niggas to eat
I put the fear of god in you in these streets(MAN UP)

[Verse 2]
You better move, UH, or imma bust right through
The room fulla niggas just like you
Im a Loose cannon Any second i could blow
Throwing Niggas off the fucking stage at they own show
And them undercovers that you got to pay protect
They ain't taking bullets for you, they don't even respect
These niggas corny, take they famous shine away
Ain't No Bitch Giving you the time of day
Ain't No Bitch Giving you no kind of play
Ain't No Bitch Even gon' slide your way!
Me, Im Alive nigga, I get it poppin' wherever i go
I don't know what Snoop talking bout, I love the hoes
I Never leave the house though without that thang
If I die believe i'm going out with a bang

[Chorus](x2)
