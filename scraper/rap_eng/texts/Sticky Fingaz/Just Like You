[Verse]:
Sticky Fingaz repped for the streets gave it up for praise due
I smoked so much purple my eyes is hazel
I'm a negative nigga, just like my AIDS test
And I'mma be a problem until I get laid to rest
I've been to jail, only for a second or two
I ain't no jailbird nigga I'm a motherfuckin' criminal
The A&Rs at Def Jam must be deaf
All that wack shit they puttin' out no wonder they in debt
And I don't care if it's two pairs or it's one
I'mma have niggas shakin' in their Air Force Ones
If there's a price on my head, I'mma spend that trap
I can't do the Superman but I can dance with death
My man's gonna make you an offer you can't refuse
And leave 'em with somethin', he gon' take your life or your jewels
I'm a human felony son I move with a bang
Fuck hittin' the waist, you better hit the shootin' range
