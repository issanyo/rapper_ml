[Hook 1 - Sticky Fingaz]
My dogs is my guns
My dogs is my guns
My dogs is my guns
My dogs is my guns
My dogs is my guns
My dogs is my guns

[Verse 1 - Sticky Fingaz]
My dogs is my guns
They attack any nigga that comes or any niggas that rings
If my Glocks on safe that means my dogs on the leash
Twenty shells in the clip, each bullet's the teeth
Keep my dogs starvin', they ain't ate in days
Keep my guns loaded, they can't wait to spray
My Glock is a Rot, my Four-Fifth is a Pit
My D.E. a bullmaster, who wanna get bit?
When my guns spark that means I let 'em loose in the park
Now let's see if your bite is as big as your bark
My Nine against your Nine to the death, have a dogfight
Foamin' at the mouthpiece, run the streets all night
My dogs turn to razors up North
They don't wear collars, scratched the serial off
No owner, no dogtag, my dogs is illegal
They bite a hole in you so big you can see through
My dogs will even bark at this whole click
This a K-9, it eats it's own shit
They tried to put him to sleep, kids scared to pet 'em
I just say "sick 'em" and it pulls of and gets 'em

[Bridge 1 - Sticky Fingaz]
My fuckin' guns, my fuckin' guns!
My dogs is my fuckin' guns!
Rob you doggystyle with the gun in your back!
My dogs is my fuckin' guns!

[Hook 2 - Black Child]
My dogs is my guns, they'll chase you if you run
Clear out the party, and bite somebody
They got niggas goin' to war for the cause
And you don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll
You don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll
You don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll
A dog ain't a Man's best friend, it's a Mac Ten
And my Mac Ten is my best friend
It got niggas goin' to war for the cause
And you don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll
You don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll
You don't want my dogs to bark at ya'll

[Verse 2 - Sticky Fingaz]
I got two dogs, one named Nigga, one named Bitch
Bitch is the one with the pretty gold clip
Nigga's the one with the taped up grip
I'll make 'em empty simultaneous 'till you get hit
Fuck fightin' in the streets, life is a struggle
Put on a silencer, now they're wearin' a muzzle
I hate Puppies, little guns, I need power
You small time, a .22, you a Chiwauwa
Teeth growin', bullets we never run out of
My dogs mate with new guns, I feed 'em gun powder
They ain't home trained, nor house broken
Mouth open, droolin', that means the barrel is smokin'
I walk my dogs every night, prime-meridian
Bust under water, they can swim, amphibian
Turn 'em to a sawed-off, get their ears chopped off
My automatics a Pit with the locked jaw

[Bridge 2 - Sticky Fingaz]
My dogs is my guns, I walk wit' 'em, talk wit 'em
Go to court wit 'em, always in Newyork wit' 'em
I never leave 'em, eat wit' em, sleep wit' 'em
Sit 'em on the sink nigga, take a leak wit' 'em

[Bridge 1 - Sticky Fingaz]

[Outro]
My dogs is my fuckin' guns!
My dogs is my fuckin' guns!
My dogs is my fuckin' guns!
My dogs is my fuckin' guns!
Bust your dogs, it's your fuckin' guns!
