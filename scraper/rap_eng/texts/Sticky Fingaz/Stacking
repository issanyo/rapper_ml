[Chorus]
We rollin' with the zombies
Stack, stack, stackin' bodies
D.O.D and Onyx
We..
Stack, stack, stackin' bodies
We rollin' with the zombies
Stack, stack, stackin' bodies
Stack, stack, stackin' bodies
Stack, stack, stackin' bodies

[Verse] Jay Reaper
Niggas wake up in Bugattis, I woke up in the streets
Right next to a dead body, let me taste that meat
The brain leak 'cause my teeth is in too deep
Yo, freaks, let's creep 'cause my life feel incomplete
I need sleep, I need peace, I need meat, I need sheep
That can follow and swallow my shit
Now peep my motto "I'll eat you brain for breakfast in the scraps for tomorrow"
I'm cannibal like Lecter, like the man I leave you..
Hollow

[Verse 2] Skits Vicious
Ayo, it's open season, I got buc shot for a silly webbing
And I don't need a reason, kick that crime on Liz Rockett
Stackin' bodies, back with Onyx, run New York, I run the mode, rockin' the stackin', blockin' the joggin'
Open the closet, closing jars, and the axe I swing is rusty and the chance you got is none
Johny here, the rum is red, and I'm on the hunt for my wife and son, bloody Mary had a little lamb, she had the silence
I shine like ultra violence my rhyme is ultra violent

[Chorus]
We rollin' with the zombies
Stack, stack, stackin' bodies
D.O.D. & Onyx
We..
Stack, stack, stackin' bodies
We rollin' with the zombies
Stack, stack, stackin' bodies
Stack, stack, stackin' bodies
Stack, stack, stackin' bodies

[Verse 3] Fredro Starr
I got bodies on ice, they stacked in the freezer
All these flashin' lights, these niggas catchin' seizures
