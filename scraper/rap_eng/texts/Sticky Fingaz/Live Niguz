[Hook]
Let all the live niggas in
Kick all the bitch-ass niggas out
We came to rock and shock the house
Turn it out and out and out

[Verse 1/Sonsee]
Ayo, the words can get intricate, vocabs in my temple
But I’ma do this swift and simple, instrumentals is what I’m into
For the money it’s essential, and I’ve got to have it
A verb addict, fanatical author with the verbals
We hurt whoever try to defy these guys
They (fry) in a skillet, so all that shit you say come on (kid, kill it!)
You yapping, not selling that crap and irking me needing a back slapping
You wouldn't know Crunch time if you was the Captain
Guess what?
It’s here, and yeah we the core, the center
It’s time to get live once more, we back on this agenda
And for ya’ll hopeful niggas, tryin to be contenders
It’s a storm
And we come down like goose coats in the winter

[Hook]

[Verse 2/Fredro Starr]
Ain't no slackin' in my action, I put my back in
Beatin' tracks in, Afficial Nast skull smashin', jaw tappin'!
(Yo, what happened)
Nothin, just niggas just bustin caps when I was rappin
Cause niggas be packin pretty pearl handle pistols just for fashion
But a fraction be actin, frontin, fakin jacks as soft as satin
But there better be no procrastin with the Mac 10 when you be blastin
Cause when you're maxin and relaxin, that’s when they start attackin
(So) get the gats, forget the facts of life, there’s no compassion
Keep your heat cause nowadays these streets are cold as the Alaskan
Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Manhattan, Staten steady stacking

[Hook]

[Verse 3/Sticky Fingaz]
Give me the shotty, let me liven up the party
I like to start trouble, cause I’m a little rowdy
And we just three emcees that like to fight
Even when we start the shit we always end it right
So for all of y'all fronting is bad for your health
Cause in the nine-fever Armee's going for self
Kids is cruel for a cause and these fucked up conditions that we all hate
But fuck it if this our fate
Just listen up to what I say, cause niggas get shot daily, every day
Even my man got killed now his family’s mourning
But from all the dirt he did, I know that hell is calling
Went to his wake and shit got held up
By niggas with masks on they face, I couldn’t escape, I was stuck
They said "everybody in here up against the wall
That dead nigga owed me money so I’m collecting from y'all"
The people gave no struggle, five minutes went fast
When  I said I ain’t giving y'all niggas shit, I’ma just have to get blasted
Representing with my life, a full fledged thief
And I’m the truth; that’s why we always have beef

[Hook]

And we do it like this, and we do it like that
Rules and regulations, so watch ya back, and pack a gat
Never fall asleep, keep ya heat in the streets
Cuz goin out, iz what it's all about

ONYX!!! LIVE!!!
ONYX!!! LIVE!!!
ONYX!!! LIVE!!!
