[Chorus: ]
I was raised in the system
Grew up as a victim
In these concrete streets
Just wanna get by
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, yea, yea

[Verse 1: ]
I'm in it, fuck the world, on moms, I'm living my life
A gutter nigga, blow weed, I'm hood for life
Catch me in the hood, grinding and hustling, nigga!
I got powder in my nails from the bricks we flippin'
Dope fiends holla at me when I'm grinding the block
I play it smart, you dumb niggas gon' get shot
Play my position, I'm ready for war up in these streets
Surviving, 'cause my momma taught me how to eat
"Pay bills and handle your biz 'cause life too short"
I took her advice, but still I'm smoking on Newport
Scarred for life, I'm Hell-bound, fuck you, nigga!
I got a uzi at the house and a chopper, nigga!
Brooklyn in this bitch by a certified gangsta
A nigga who ain't scared to ride on all you pranksters
Paid my dues in the hood, still on the block
Run from the cops, and it's "fuck 'em" on my block
It's anybody killer, and fuck all you rap niggas
God as my witness, I'm coming, I ain't bullshittin'
I'm ready for war, I'm ready for beef
And when it's on, catch me up in the streets, motherfucker

[Hook: ]
I'm a certified gangster, roaming the block
I hustle everyday and I hustle non-stop
I'm going for they ass if they plotting on the block
You better prepare for war, 'fore your ass gets shot

[Chorus: ]
I was raised in the system
Grew up as a victim
In these concrete streets
Just wanna get by
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, yea, yea

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
What's up, niggas? Sticky Fingaz up in this bitch
I'm on that Brooklyn bullshit, from Grave Street to the bricks
Don't make me click-clack-blaow at your wig
Doing dirt, motherfucker, till I'm filthy rich
No matter where I been, I always brought a piece of the projects
When I ain't had nothing but linen increase in my pockets
I do what I want, I don't care if nobody like me
I ain't here to make friends, I split your head to the white meat
You acting like a bitch, emotional like wifey
Could've ripped your fucking heart out, you wanna be like me?
When I be cleaning my gun, I be singing this shit
Sharpening my knife, singing this shit
Loading bullets in the clip, niggas singing this shit
And at your eulogy, they gon' be singing this shit

[Hook: ]
I'm a certified gangster, roaming the block
I hustle everyday and I hustle non-stop
I'm going for they ass if they plotting on the block
You better prepare for war, 'fore your ass gets shot

[Bridge: ]
Believe me, 'lieve me, it's the season
We spit real talk 'cause the streets, they need this
See I, I preach it, really gon' teach it
All lil homies, nephews and nieces
It's all real talk and it's here for life
The streets don't play, you might die tonight, damn
The streets don't play, you might die tonight

[Hook: ]
I'm a certified gangster, roaming the block
I hustle everyday and I hustle non-stop
I'm going for they ass if they plotting on the block
You better prepare for war, 'fore your ass gets shot
