[Intro: Jay Reaper]
Ey yo move mate I'm getting moody
Cause your music you don't move me
I'm in the mood today to just shoot away
Nigga too cray Paul Mooney
Ya bitch niggas just tomb raid em
We crusade from here to UK
Like a new plague Its to late
We bring it, Doomsday

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
[?]
Not with the time but she a snowflake
In the bathroom taking a coke break
Doing crooked shit to get the dough straight
Fuck a jimbo we whole weight
Pushing pounds through the whole state
I got bullets in your brain just rotate
Leave a nigga body in a cold state
Rigor mortis that's when you go against niggas orders
Electric tape like Biggie thought us
The type that'll kidnap niggas daughters
Half my niggas is brain dead
Eyes the color blood stained red
(now is not the time for fear, that comes later)
Like Bane said

[Hook: Jay Reaper]
Ey yo move mate I'm getting moody
Cause your music you don't move me
I'm in the mood today to just shoot away
Nigga too cray Paul Mooney
Ya bitch niggas just tomb raid em
We crusade from here to UK
Like a new plague Its to late
We bring it, Doomsday

[Verse 2: Skits Vicious]
Gimmie the title I'm killin my rivals
And any beside them with evil intent
Trap it, Onyx D.O.D on it
We quick to demolish your feeble event
Read all about it we out here
[?]
Sticky and Dro fill em with holes
Vicious and Reap put em to sleep
Deadly vapors plastic tubes and respirators
Stack of paper, back to Vegas
Crack a bottle, smack a waiter
So and so they sew you up
Comatose you roasted duck
Back on the scene with a banger
Handle the heat with the hammer

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingas]
I'm still on paper fresh outta jail
No heavenly father i was raised in hell
Barely had a mother she was raised in bail
Sister around the corner selling fruit cocktails
Bitches on your knees niggas get your hands up
Whats it gonna be? either way imma bust
I'm movin overseas America is so fucked
Must've got drunk woke up and voted for Trump?
Its the end of the world and I'm holding a pump
Dick to your girl while she's rolling my blunt
Drink in my hand while I'm slappin her butt
If its doomsday imma go nuts
Take you apart see what you're made of
Playing a part, your whole life's made up
Take out your heart, see what your brain does
Soon its death what you afraid of?

[Outro: Jay Reaper]
Ey yo move mate I'm getting moody
Cause your music you don't move me
I'm in the mood today to just shoot away
Nigga too cray Paul Mooney
Ya bitch niggas just tomb raid em
We crusade from here to UK
Like a new plague Its to late
We bring it, Doomsday
