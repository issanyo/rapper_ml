[Intro: sample, (Sticky Fingaz), Just Gii]
Damn, that DJ made my day
(Yeah, it’s ya boy, Sticky Fingaz from Onyx)
(And my girl Just Gii)
Celebrate life, life
Celebrate life, life
(Everybody, put ya glasses up)

[Verse 1: Sticky Fingaz]
He put me in Onyx, took me out the streets
Seventeen years old JMJ sign me
And to these days I can’t believe he passed away
Any DJ that lived could get with Jam Master Jay
In fact that I knew him at all was a blessing
But since he been gone I gotta fight this war with my left hand
He told me out a “Rock Box” and “Walk This Way”
Every picture he was in he had a smile on his face
He had the biggest heart, he was tougher than leather
He was a who that held Run-D.M.C. together
Talking “Kings of Rock” who you know was better?
The first group that go gold in the Golden Era
First rappers on the cover of the Rolling Stone mag
First group to get a Grammy nomination at last
Even talk about Mizell make the madface sad
He’s more than a DJ he’s like a big bro I never had

[Chorus: Just Gii]
Celebrate Jam Master Jay
Celebrate every DJ
Celebrate the jams they play
Celebrate life

[Post-Chorus: Just Gii]
Celebrate life, life
Celebrate life, life

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Jay was the illest that I ever met I promise
He was a gift cause his presence gave me so much knowledge
He wasn’t in it for a fame, never did it for a dollars
Just wanted to be the best, sure is he never left Hollis
He being in my life so god damn monumental
I was already nice and he show me the fundamentals
Like we selling artists, we ain’t selling songs
Songs come and go but the artists lives on
He left behind a family and we all miss him
But it belongs to the world, he a hip-hop legend
I remember us arguing while we making a song
See I even got his number still saved in my phone
Man I freaking hate funerals and I swear I hate wakes
As strong as I am, somehow it always makes me break
Guess he’s living up there now and got all plains
Be down here hell they ain’t even solved his case

[Chorus: Just Gii]
Celebrate Jam Master Jay
Celebrate every DJ
Celebrate the jams they play
Celebrate life

[Outro: Just Gii & sample]
Celebrate life, life
Celebrate life, life
Celebrate life, life
Celebrate life, life
You’ll see Jay again my friend
