[Intro: Sticky Fingaz & sample]
Do you feel the way I feel?
Feel that shit nigga
Do you feel the way I feel?
Do you fucking feel it?

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
You wanna wild out, come on! Act up, come on!
Throw guns, come on! Smoke 'dro, come on!
Fuck hoes, come on! Make dough, come on!
What?! We can do it kid however you want!
You wanna wild out, come on!
Act up, come on! Start beef, come on!
Make money, come on! Throw guns, come on!
Fuck hoes, come on! What?
We can do it kid however you want!

[Verse 1: Sticky Fingaz]
Oh you ain't know? Sticky Fingaz went solo
And got the whole hood in a choke hold
Radio locked like I was po-po, you rappers get no dough
I make you have oral sex with the .44
I'm unstable, get cash under the table
I blaze you, not even God could save you
What? I ain't having it, I'm ignorant and arrogant
Dogs couldn't sniff me out, cause I ain't have a scent
Your wifey's checking me, said I had sex appeal
Been hitting niggas' girls way before the record deal
Let me make it clear just so it's understood:
That don't make you no thug cause you from the hood
My nine's stainless, I speak in sign language
My mind changes, every time the wind blows
Gunshots got me jumping out of second story windows
Beef on impulse, you get murdered over insults

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
You wanna wild out, come on! Act up, come on!
Throw guns, come on! Smoke 'dro, come on!
Fuck hoes, come on! Make dough, come on!
What?! We can do it kid however you want!
You wanna wild out, come on!
Act up, come on! Start beef, come on!
Make money, come on! Throw guns, come on!
Fuck hoes, come on! What?
We can do it kid however you want!

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Goddamn I'm hungry and it's time to eat
I'm the worst thing since crack to hit the street
The man that could murder me, I'm dying to meet
Rather fuck your own seed than shoot a 5 with me
I don't take shit from no man, I set up my own fam
I never was a kid, came out the pussy a grown man
I slept in a slum, I'm second to none
I give you ten seconds to run, 9, 7, 3, 2, blow!
Half my niggas ain't gon' never see sunlight
Got twenty stitches under my navel from a gunfight
You better watch your back for them thug hoes
I believe in safe sex and go to bed with the snub nose
Rhyme like my life on the line, I'm nice with the nine
Knocking out big niggas twice my size
So take a dirt nap when normal people slept I used to purse snatch
A bullet costs a quarter but your life ain't even worth that

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
You wanna wild out, come on! Act up, come on!
Throw guns, come on! Smoke 'dro, come on!
Fuck hoes, come on! Make dough, come on!
What?! We can do it kid however you want!
You wanna wild out, come on!
Act up, come on! Start beef, come on!
Make money, come on! Throw guns, come on!
Fuck hoes, come on! What?
We can do it kid however you want!

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
It's a whole new me, but the same old you
We had beef before, well deja vu
Never seen nothing like this I rip your whole crew
Ever thought about death? That's what you 'bout to go through
I stay to myself, I'm antisocial
I ghost you and wild out like I'm supposed to
My rollie got a body son, it costs a life
Every time it tick I can see the soul on ice
I call a hotline, to get yours, I got mine
And son I got Glock 9s, TEC-9s, MAC-10s, 11s and 12s
.22s, .25s, .32s, .38s, .44s, .45s, AK-47s
Don't be a smartass, I put a hole in your forehead
Stomp you out and beat your ass to syllables
You stupid mother..., be lucky I ain't killing you all
I hung myself on my umbilical cord

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
You wanna wild out, come on! Act up, come on!
Throw guns, come on! Smoke 'dro, come on!
Fuck hoes, come on! Make dough, come on!
What?! We can do it kid however you want!
You wanna wild out, come on!
Act up, come on! Start beef, come on!
Make money, come on! Throw guns, come on!
Fuck hoes, come on! What?
We can do it kid however you want!
Yeah, aha!
