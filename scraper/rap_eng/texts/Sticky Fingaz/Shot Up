Kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out
Giva fuck

[Sticky Fingaz]
This is AK-47, banana clip rap
Bloodstain your album cover before it get wrapped
P-89 your mind, you won't forget that
Caught behind enemy lines, you gonna get clapped
On chase got shot in the face
Nine niggas, broad to nothin, while the slug judged his fate
Shoulda got low 'steada tryna flossin his cake
Reaction was slow, reflexes way too late
These are warzone niggas, home sweet home niggas
Killers ain't afraid of nothin, it's on niggas
M-14 your legs with one in your head
Put chumps to sleep, lay 'em in deathbed

[Hook]
You get shot up
Go in the hood you not from
You get shot up
Twenty-two shots'll leave you numb
You get shot up
Startin the beef with no gun
You get shot up
Blah!  You get shot up, blah!
You get shot up
Leavin wit' bitches after the club
You get shot up
Stuck at the light, sittin on dubs
You get shot up
Left for dead in your own blood
You get shot up
Blah!  You get shot up

[Sticky Fingaz]
You never saw the nigga face that was holdin the Glock
You just heard shots then the nigga next to you dropped
Til you seen blood you ain't even know you got popped
Felt your body temperature change from cold to hot
Left you for dead, you still alive, count your blessings
In the middle of the street holdin in your intestines
All they wanted was the money, you had to be dumb
Jumped for the gun, he blew off and punctured your lung
Your man came back and found you scrollin on the pavement
Grabbed you in his arms and said "hold on son you gon' make it!"
Your vital signs droppin, your haloucinatin
"Somebody call the ambulance!"  If you live it's amazing
One still in your stomach, two went through your chest
Your boy tellin you "don't talk son, save your breath"
The more you walk to the light the more it's hurtin less
You gettin nautious from the smell of burnin flesh
Cryin to God, think he can hear you beg?
Tears in your eyes, screamin "I can't feel my legs!"
You closer to death, paramedics pumpin your chest
Blowin you breath, you dyin but you under arrest
How it feel to see a man dead knowin you next
I guess that's what niggas meant by blood in the x
Tryin to hang on but you gon' wish you was dead
Cause if you live the rest of your life it's in the feds

[Hook]
You get shot up
Go in the hood you not from
You get shot up
Twenty-two shots'll leave you numb
You get shot up
Startin the beef with no gun
You get shot up
Blah!  You get shot up, blah!
You get shot up
Leavin wit' bitches after the club
You get shot up
Stuck at the light, sittin on dubs
You get shot up
Left for dead in your own blood
You get shot up
Blah!  You get shot up

You get shot up, you get shot up
You get shot up, you get shot up
You get shot up, you get shot up
You get shot up, you get shot up
You get shot up, you get shot up
You get shot up, you get shot up
You get shot up, you get shot up
You get shot up, you get shot up
