[Intro]
My name Sticky Fingaz, you know what I'm saying?
Crazy ass [?], Onyx
Make no mistake about it, we definitely gangsta up in here
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
I ain't got no tattoos, nigga, this ain't Weezy
Hold up, I ain't dissing, nigga, take it easy
I'm scarred for life, nigga, believe me
Used to live in the hood now I live on TV
What rap star you know walk around with no security?
Hold his own gun, cop his own weed
If I want at you dead, I do it myself
No entourage, just me, you and God
Wanna know how I be rippin' shit? Ask Eminem
How I be putting niggas on? Ask 50 Cent
How I be yoking niggas up? You could ask Jay
How I been throwing deals away? Just ask Dr. Dre
I'm too thug, you'd think I spit 2Pac ashes
I'm too hood to do those little dumb-ass dances
Beef with me, y'all gon' have to take y'all chances
Like, "Is he really crazy enough to shoot those cannons?"

[Hook]
You need those jewels, you need those Phantoms
You need girls at your video, dancin'
You need bad cars, need those mansions
‘Cause y'all ain't got no swagger
You need those shines, you need those dubs
You need those bottles to get in the club
You need your crew so you could act thug
‘Cause y'all ain't got no swagger

[Post-Hook]
Swagger, swagger
Girl, come get this swagger
Swagger, swagger
Mommy, come and get this swagger
Swagger, swagger
Girl, come get this swagger
Swagger, swagger
Mommy, come and get this swagger

[Verse 2]
Y'all niggas don't want no beef
Y'all niggas won't bust no heat
Y'all niggas won't shoot police
Y'all niggas don't run those streets
Y'all niggas don't know what it mean to die or eat
Shit, I need some publicity, nigga, I'll pop you
All them fake jewels you wearing, can't even rob you
You ain't hard, nah, you just high
You need the drugs to forget you pussy inside
I be taking niggas girls but don't take it me
Shit, you could ask Usher, you could ask Tyrese
You could ask Scott Storch, I don't pay for beats
You could ask the DA about the cases I beat
Yo, I bogart the game, who gon' stop me?
The ratchet stay cocked, that's why I'm so cocky
But I ain't like these other cats, I don't be beefin'
At least with nobody who heart still beatin'

[Hook]
You need those jewels, you need those Phantoms
You need girls at your video, dancin'
You need bad cars, need those mansions
‘Cause y'all ain't got no swagger
You need those shines, you need those dubs
You need those bottles to get in the club
You need your crew so you could act thug
‘Cause y'all ain't got no swagger

[Post-Hook]
Swagger, swagger
Girl, come get this swagger
Swagger, swagger
Mommy, come and get this swagger
Swagger, swagger
Girl, come get this swagger
Swagger, swagger
Mommy, come and get this swagger

[Outro]
Man, I think, uh, the first time I ever go exposed to Hip-Hop
It had to be like, way young, like
First of all, I started DJing before I was even rappin'
I don't know, I was probably like 10 or 11 or something like that
Beg my mom to buy me turntables, she finally got me the turntables
The records I had, that was poppin' was Run-DMC, of course
You know what I mean?
And mind you, I didn't even know what I was doing!
I'm like 11, you know what I mean?
But I'm seeing it done and I'm mixing, think I'm doin'
Matter of fact, my mom had a baby shower for my lil brother
And me and my cousin, Fredro, was DJing the baby shower!
When I was in high school
