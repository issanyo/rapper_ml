It’s hard to be a thug
The word – understand it
I’m alone I ain’t got no family
Live or die, I don’t care anymore
I’d be surprised if I live to see 24
They label me a role model
But you don’t wanna be like me kid
My life is in ?
All I do is drink and smoke weed fuck bitches
And wait for some nigga to come and smoke me
You think I’m joking, this life is killing me
I got shot in the stomach and the bullet is still in me
My girl kiss me goodbye, gives me good luck
Said all I am good for is a good fuck
I don’t know how much more I can take
Going broke kid, spending more than I make
A thug can only be so much till he brake
The next time you see me it be at my ?

Hook (2x)
Thugs on the street with a taste for blood
?
?
It’s hard to be a thug like me

It’s hard to be a thug hoes down throw you G’s up
It’s life or death, blast – you can’t freeze up
I’m staying hardcore my ?
And he knocking knocking at my door
You think them juice is worth your life
Give me them Benz and belief ?
Wait wait let’s have a understanding
You going be under and I’m gonna be standing
I ain’t got no kids I know about
A thug fuck a bitch and throw her out
I don’t gotta pick the ass ‘cause se give it up
All I want is the cash so I can live it up
? don’t belief me try it
You be hooked up to a RV screaming why me
Fighting for your life but you can’t hold off
Life go on nigga

Hook (2x)

Shorty said he wanna be a thug
But it’s hard to be a thug like me
Shorty said he wanna be a thug
But it’s hard to be a thug like me
It’s hard to be a thug I’m still struggling
That’s why I’m mugging niggas on a train
Blow a hole in their had so big you can so their brain
Most the bullets I shot, they had no names
If you a thug than you probably been arrested
Can’t get no honest job with a record
Suicide – yeah maybe that’s the answer
I do it slow so ?
It’s hard to be a thug plus I’m black
Everywhere I go I gotta watch my back
I can’t even leave my crib without the ?
Nigga want some? Take that take that
All the thugs I know is dead or in jail
If you a thug and you alive then you living in hell
I’m paranoid in a life of danger
Trust no one and treat myself like a stranger

Hook (2x)
