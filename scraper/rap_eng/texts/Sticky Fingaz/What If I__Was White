[Intro: Eminem, (Sticky Fingaz)]
Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab Sticky right quick
Hey yo Stick, Stick
(Yo, Slim Shady
Yo, I just had like a nightma…
Wait, it wasn’t like a nightmare
It was like a good drea…
Well, it wasn’t a good…) What was it?
(Hey, yo, I just had a crazy dream man.) What?
(Yo, yo I dreamt I was white!) Oh shit!

[Chorus: Eminem]
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?

[Verse 1: Sticky Fingaz, (Eminem)]
What if I was white skinned, the same color as cocaine?
Blond hair, blue eyes, the whole shibang
I know one thing: police wouldn’t always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jocking me
(Can I get your autograph?)
The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
I wouldn’t need collateral to buy property
If I was white, wouldn’t matter if I was rich or poor
Security wouldn’t follow me around the store
(Maybe he might have stole something)
Like I’d steal something, because I’m black I rob
And automatically assume I ain’t got no job
On my own land, I feel like an immigrant
If I was white, I wouldn’t have thought OJ was innocent
(He did it) If I was white…

[Chorus: Eminem]
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz, (Eminem)]
If I was white, it'd be a different world for me
If I was white, hm? What shade would I be?
Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, preppy or high class?
(You’d probably live in a trailer park and be white trash!)
In any case, that be the ill shit right?
But there’s a good and bad side of being white
You can’t say the ‘N’ word without starting a fight (What’s up, my nigga?)
Couldn’t dance to a beat, I’d have two left feet
Even if I was white, probably still have a ghetto shit (How you doing?)
Is it a myth or do I really have a little dick? (Nah, it’s true!)
If I was white, I would probably listen to hard rock
And cover my ears whenever I heard Hip Hop

[Chorus: Eminem]
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz (Eminem)]
If I was white I’d probably wouldn’t even think the same
I’d watch Tennis and Golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings, man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white I couldn’t live around my way
And there probably would of never even been an Onyx, shit
I be somewhere sipping Vodka and Tonix
Smoking on a Marlboro instead of a Newport
I’d live in Long Island instead of New York
If I was white, I probably couldn’t dunk
Cause everybody knows White Man Can’t Jump (Nope!)
And probably wouldn’t be able to go to the weed spot
Cause all of the dreads would think I’m a cop

[Chorus: Eminem]
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?
What If he was white? What if he was white?
What if he was white? What… if… he… white?
What if he was white? What if he was
White, white, white, white, white
White, white, white, white, white?

[Outro: Eminem]
Yo, what if I was white?
