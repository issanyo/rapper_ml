Hey yo, fuck it, I'm rollin' in a 4-barrel Camaro
Toward the Tribore, eyes narrow, East River flow with marrow
Along side the bridge zombies pushing bodies in wheel barrels
Bitches sterile follow on crutches of rusted arrows
Tryin' breath through esophagus stuffed with sparrows
Listen, to the [Incomprehensible] of hysterical, pleads for miracles
Time to overthrow the imperial, terrarembrium, the spherical
I turn the steering wheel and pull into a 7-Eleven
Met up with Billy, Danny, Rob and Evan from the fucking Bio
Yo, we down for survival with acid rain drenched
Skin infested by termites, hermaphrodites on bikes
Swing spikes, think twice as I try to pacify the pariah
Beside the driver and shotgun Kelly flips the visor
Time to devise a plan to reverse the demise of man before he's met
By the last set of the sun, Armageddon, no question to answer
Disaster results from behavior patterns, Earth lay raped
Escape to Saturn in a capsule, thirteen days of travel
Upon arrival plans unravel, imbalance of chemical pheromones
Clones with no genitals surround us, we can't fuck them
No means of reproduction, I hear a scream and turn in that
Direction, 33-23-33, I see seven coming toward us to reward us
Disorder, enter the Millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder
Disorder, enter the Millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder
Armageddon, a new death is dawnin'
I like the smell of napalm in the morning
Four riders of the apocalypse descend from the north
A tear in my eye, I behold a pale horse
Armageddon, no time to cry, we all die
As the sky turns red, the missiles start to fly
Faction stake action, eleven families rule
The Millennium approaches, survival of the roaches
Body armor will make you feel calmer
Or safe from the drama deploy stealth
Military bombers, ass out
Get down on your knees and pray
Illuminati takes your soul on the eve of judgment day
As the armies of darkness irradiate life
And we all go to hell and Satan fucks your wife
Strife, terror without a minute to pray
Human beings at odds, peace becomes disarray
Humongous from Mad Max, Lord of the Wasteland
With crazy ill troops all at my command
Don't you ever fall victim to my master plan
I'm the dealer of death and here's your motherfuckin' hand
Disorder, enter the Millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder
Disorder, enter the Millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder
I'm ready to take back whatever they sold ya
'Cuz the scheme is a secret so nobody ever told ya
An underground illuminated tribe of radicals
Ready to take forth and feast like cannibals
Animals, huffing the fumes of rotting flesh exhumed
From the corpses of presidents, dissents and fools
With a one way ticket from the temple of doom
Dark sides of moons and ill atomic booms
Leave the earth all shakin' and full of wounds
From Krakatoa East of Java to Cameroon
And coming soon to a theater near you
The end of everything that we once knew
The grand finale strap my body with TNT
Take the president and his bitch with me
Tearing down the walls of this conspiracy
Fuck skull and bones and Illuminati
Eradication of the land of the free but I'm the brave
Ain't going out like a motherfuckin' slave
Neobarbaric post apocalyptic war
Ground zero, Brooklyn, the world at war
Disorder, enter the Millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder
Disorder, enter the Millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder
I woke up, bar codes on my forehead
It's a living nightmare, my families all dead
I gotta call Fred but no dial tone
I'm out for self 'cuz I'm gonna die alone
This is madness, I'm drooling with the lock jaw
My elevator don't go to the top floor
I hold my breath 'cuz the O2 killed, I'm suffocating
I can't pay my oxygen bill
There's no tomorrow, I wish a nigga murdered me
The President declared a state of emergency
The coast guard bangin' at my front door
I got homemade bombs if they want war
There's no sun, they put a fucking chip in me
I'm a clone, matta fact it's a different me
I'm high tech kid, you get a bomb in the mail
So if you die today then I'll see you in hell
See you in hell, see you in hell
Disorder, enter the Millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder
Disorder, enter the Millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder
Disorder, enter the Millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder
Disorder, enter the Millennium, time gets shorter
Disorder, behold a pale horse, new world disorder, disorder
