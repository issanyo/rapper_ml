[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
ONYX started with Fredro, Big DS and Sonsee
Two of three got stranded, so we OT
So make you billy end it up
Doing a song with Sticky
And JMJ said he ain't sign Onyx without ME
Official Nasty, see a monster amongst the truth
Cause truth be told, two ain't even want me in the group
So I ripped out my heart, how can I be this nice?
And you waiting for my verse like it was Jesus Christ!
Then Big DS die...
