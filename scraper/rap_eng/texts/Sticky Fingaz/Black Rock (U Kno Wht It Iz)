Onyxdomain.com, you know what it is
100 Mad niggas, you know what it is
Sticky Fingaz my dog; you know what it is
Black Rock, you already know what it is
Dro Starr in this bitch, you know what it is
Major Independents, you know what it is
My Mad Face Clique, you know what it is
Official Nast, you already know what it is

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Ayo what happened New York, what, what, what happened
What happened New York, what, what, what happened
What happened to that hard shit, these punks is got garbage
For the limelight, these Niggas don't rhyme right, these dudes sound like
Computer love, computer thugs won't shoot a slug
Hip-hop Honors awards, they don't mention us
Hundred best hip-hop songs, they don't mention us
Top-ten best rap groups, they don't mention us
Hundred mad shoot up the club, let they mention us
Top five dead or alive that's my pick
Number one is Run, two is Pac, three is B.I.G., four is me, five is Stick
'Cause he say the craziest shit
We the most hated, most underrated
Brought the East Coast back when the West Coast dominated
Still getting paid, the economy fucked up
On youtube rappers getting robbed and stucked up
The internet got the game in a drought
Niggas better start looking out and start looking now

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
If hip-hop is dead then this must be Easter, bitch
I'm bout to take that T-Pain shit and break that shit
You ain't heard me in while but probably seen me in some flicks
It's the ONYX! You don't know us just google
The most ruthless, most vicious, most brutal
Believe me dude, I bust more than rhymes
I'm a magician, I can turn yours to mine
Niggas get shot all the time it ain't no Biggie
Bust my .9 like Shyne but get away like Diddy
Dre only signed Fiddy cause he couldn't get Sticky
I'm my own boss, who you know fucking with me
Yeah right, bring em out I punch em dead in they mouth son
The rap game depression like Kanye's album
Been letting y'all run with the torch for too long
Pick your favorite rapper I'll body him up on his own song
