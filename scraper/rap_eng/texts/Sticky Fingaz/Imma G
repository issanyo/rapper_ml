[Hook] Method Man
My chucks is scuffed up, Kahkis hang low
Mass amount of hoes, my rims and chain glow
I'm all about my dough
What, bitch? You ain't know?
(Imma G, the one these lil' niggas wanna be)
Look, I'm on my A-game, niggas stay in ya lane
Pump ya brakes 'fore I've pumped 2 slugs straight in ya brain
Look, I blow like kane
Bitch, you know the name
(Imma G, the one these lil' niggas wanna be)

[Verse] Sticky Fingaz
Your friend hate me
Told you not to jump in the truck
What?
She mad cause ain't nobody fuckin' with her
Talkin' 'bout I'm a playa, she a lesbian
If I ain't want you, I feel like less of a man
And I ain't chase trynna get it us out of tongues you with
But hey, ma, I figure we gotta start somewhere
Cause on the real, sex is 80% of any relationship
If you're wack or vice verse, we gon' split
But, I still respect you with more to come
I got love for all women
Shit, my mom's one
So what's it's gonna be?
You comin' thru? Am I gonna see you later?
I'm here now take your number
But I can't sleep with a piece of paper
I had ya for undressing time, for your danger
Life is short, ma
You know you gotta play hard
Nah, I ain't sure convince you to fuck
Shit, this nigga lookin' for a bitch
She know what she want

[Bridge] Method Man
Whaddup, shitty draws-ass niggas?
This your boy big Meth right here
Comin' thru with a sue
You know how the W-U do it
We ain't playin' wit ya, motherfuckers

[Verse 2] Merkules
The illest ever
I'll kill 'em for instant pleasure
Got so many 16's that they think it’s a Quinceañera
We live in our different measures
Big Pun, I bring the terror
My squad pack 'em all, Heavy Metal and Simple Terror
Got my shorty in the front seat countin' my dough
So much ice on my wrist that it's like I'm out in the cold
If you show up to the show, you see a mass amount of hoes
We front of mountains where it snows
About a thousand below
I got my girl countin' money wit a blunt in her mouth
She calculate it then she hide the safe under the couch
We in the whip 'til it crash
Rollin' with Sticky and Kazh
We keep the 100s at the crib and put the 50s in bags
I just focus on the future, I don't live in the past
These bitches screamin' when they see us
Tell them "get in the cab"
Wu-Tang, Stompdown, it's a 100MAD thing
Imma come for that crown, I'm the underground king
It's Merk

[Bridge] Method Man
My man Kazh
He gonna come thru
And let ya niggas know what time it is on this side of thing
Shout out to Van city, all day
Let's go

[Verse 3] Young Kazh
She need a space, some like borderlines
So accustomed to get it, nigga don't pay no mind
Still that way, she rock them Cardi Yays, killin' niggas
She don't fuck around with lames, she don't feel them niggas
Red bottoms, cut 'em up, ma
Heal them niggas
Business type, body crazy like her attitude
Kush got her higher than the altitude
Street nigga, with not that much to prove
Took it to the club, just to watch her move
Do some Marvin Gayon to get her in the mood
You were square, nigga
She call you Rubik's cube
Say she tired of these boys like the last dude
You should try to treat your self, fuck that fast food
Give a real nigga pussy, that some smart move
80's baby, mom of the Dick Crazy
Future in my eyes make me leave with your lady
Like..
