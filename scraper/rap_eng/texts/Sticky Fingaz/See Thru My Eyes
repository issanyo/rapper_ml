[Sticky's talking]
See the way I got it figured the fucking whole world revolve around me
How you figured that? How you figured the world revlove around you?
When I get shot dont nobody feel that shit except for fucking me
If Idie the world is over
The world revolve around me just like the world revolve around you

[J. Blanco] I got you
[Sticky F.] Oh shit... yo, turn the mic up
[J. Blanco] Let these niggas know what we talk about here

[Hook:]
[J. Blanco] If you could see through my eyes, what would you see?
[Sticky F.] And if you'd seen what I saw, how would it be?

[Sticky]
Ain't nothin I ain't seen with this pair of eyes
I've seen niggas get beaten 'til they was paralysed
I've seen enough coke to get this whole room high
Seen enough death to make the fucking whole world cry
I've seen cops on the take supplyin blocks for weight
I see niggas who don't care bust shoots at jakes
I've seen bitches at the club getting toxicated
When they awake can't count how many cocks she ate
You think the shit that happeneds to me affects you too

[J. Blanco]
Hell no, cause you world revolve around you

[Sticky]
And my world revolve around me
You ain't did what I've done

[J. Blanco]
And you ain't seen what I've seen

[Sticky]
For everybody time moves different, for me it's b-ball
Some niggas see their world behind a cell and 3 walls
Some niggas can't see it at all
Some niggas still in the dark
Some niggas armied out smoking crows in the park

[Sticky's singing]
If you get shot, hear, your moms'll cry
But she wouldn't feel the pain that you feel inside
I want the world to go black I just close my eyes
And the day the world ends is the day I die

[Hook]

[J. Blanco]
See, in this thug-shit when the guns go it's like time stand still
I've seen bullets move at them rapidly attacking their grill
So try to duck down and chill, adrenaline rushes, a second's eternity
Flesh burning, a four-five I lift and I'mma turn at them
Bleedin intrnaly two in the throat, one in the lung
I've seen them trying to studder words having a seizure biting his tounge
I've seen my man down on the cold pavement left to die
Look into his eyes caught chills seeing his soul in the sky
Seen the four-fours of outlaws barking at boys
They say it's death when rain comes, it's pouring cats and dogs
I see motherfuckers thinking like they got nine lifes
Got shot 9 times left behind their kids and their wifes
Through my eyes define, real, what's the money you touch
The fast life's a world of matrix enables us to touch
I can slide aside a killers mind and show you his sins
See I'm deep with the street like murdurer with blood on his Timbs

[Hook]

[Sticky]
If you get shot, hear, your moms'll cry
But she wouldn't feel the pain that you feel inside
I want the world to go black I just close my eyes
And the day the world ends is the day I die
