[Intro]
Now a days it's easier to get a gun than a education
That's why kids in trench coats shoot up they schools
And parents out live they kids
And sex, the thing that bring life also take it away
When you say this is a wonderful world, ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse]
I have seen red for green, dead soldiers too
I've seen men kill, coulda been me or you
And I think to myself: what a wonderful world
(Yo, yo world, yo, the time is runnin' out, the times runnin' out)

I have seen guys in blue, sieze pounds of white
The rich rule the day, the poor starve at night
And I think to myself: what a wonderful world
(Yo, yo world, yo, the time is runnin' out, the times runnin' out)

The serpent and the angel so deadly in disguise
And all sorts of races of people drop like flies
I've seen friends making friends, saying "The hell with you"
Niggas be jealous, hating on you
I've seen babies dying, can't watch them grow
Brothers at war in every ghetto
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
(Yo, yo world, yo, the time is runnin' out, the times runnin' out)
Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Ohh, yeahhh
