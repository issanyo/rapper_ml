[Verse 1]
The Illest Man That I Know Is Me
The One They Love And Fear
Made The World
Shave Their Hair Bald
Make The Mad Face
And Pretend That They Was Me
I Was Raised Up By These Streets
Whatever I Touch I Take I Keep
Bronx, Brooklyn, Harlem, Queens
The Whole N.Y.C
I Will Make You Call The Police
Cause I'm Just Too Damn Loud
The Legends Real
I Should Make You Bow
Kiss The Ground Beneath My Feet
They Say: "Sticky, You Killing That Shit"
But I Really Bring Life To It

[Hook]
Give Me All You Got
And Do Everything That I Say
Put Your Fingaz Up
We'll Be On Our Way
Once We Get Paid
They Give Me All The Love
But This Money I'm A Have To Take
Keep Your Fingaz Up
I Promise Everything Gonna Be OK

[Verse 2]
Sticky Fingaz Got You Watching "EMPIRE" Again
My Bars Is Bullets
Wrote Em With A Firing Pen
Anybody That Anybody, I Bodied It's A Long List
Only Niggas I Ain't Bodied I Never Did A Song With
Don't Steal No More? But I Don't Steal No Less
Shot Up The Source
Shooting For The Grammys Next
Climbing The Charts Looking Up Ariana Grande Dress
If I Don't Get An Award I'm Stealing Kanye Shit

People Think I'm Mean
But I'm Really Nice
I Mean I'm Mean
But I Mean I Mean I'm Really Nice
And I Take Everything Literally
I Mean Literally I Take Everything
It's About Time, T.I.M.E: The Illest Motherfucker Ever
Come outside and See
The 19th Letter
STICKY F.I.N.G.A.Z
