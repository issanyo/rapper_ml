[Intro]
Hustle hard
Get ya hustle on, go 'head
Get ya hustle on, y'all go 'head
Late night hustling, Im caught up in the hustle

[Verse 1 - Fredro Starr]
Three am, hustling hours
You better get your money, you ain't fucking with ours
We built it up from the ground up, like the towers
Keep it uncut, we don't fuck with the flour
Late night dope sales, open door sales
Homes in the hotel, cope with cartels
Oh well, the feds ridin' my coattails
Throw away the key, throwing me in the cold cell
United States ghetto, getting money out the state
First week strong, a hundred thousand at the gate
Ain't no love in the street, my thugs throwing slugs where you sleep
And niggas pull the rug from your feet
South side, nigga, from the heart like, 'what up?'
Dark side, one thirsty first so blood up
Homie got sent to the isle up north
Bet it ends up being no talking, head up or shut up

[Hook]
Get ya hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Go 'head, get your hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Get ya hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Better get your money, you ain't touching ours
Hustle hard
Get ya hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Go 'head, get your hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Hustle hard
Get ya hustle on (Hustlin hours)
Better get your money, you ain't touching ours

[Verse 2 - Makem Pay]
All I sell is cocaine, I'm a drug dealer
Nah for real, I'm a motherfucking drug dealer
By my work soft, cook that up
You need a nine, straight drop, I hook that up
Streets keep calling, it's hard for me to quit
Just when I think I'm out, they need a brick
Back to the hood again, all black hood again
When I'm round the fiends, know the coke good again
My hours is from twelve to twelve and
365, 24/7 I'm selling
I get a rush just bagging that cane
Smoking Mary Jane, packing that thing
All I do it hustle, fuck a 9 to 5
Start at 9, make 6 by 5
It's an all day process, even on a Sunday
Koran on the dashboard, bring you what you ask for

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Sticky Fingaz]
Niggas got shooters, got hoes, got hammers for sale
Got coke, got weed, got grams and scale
Got anything you need, ain't no way in hell
There's something money can't buy even in jail
In theese streets im the landlord, niggas gotta pay rent
Live on the top floor but came from the basement
Niggas tryna come at me foul, catch a flagrant
Hustle so hard I don't know where the day went
Move work turn bricks to bags, get fixed for cash
Even did some licks for laughs
Chicks on smash, selling pussy, pimp that ass
Kids with masks demanding where you hid the stash

[Hook]
