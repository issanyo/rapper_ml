[Intro: Sticky Fingaz]
It could be you…

[Chorus: Jasia'n]
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
He was just going to the store to get some "Swisher's"
Get a couple scratch off, sat a long day, worked his ass off
Ain't doing nothing just minding his own business
Trying to get home and watch the "Heat" play "Memphis"
Off the street he saw the one's out
For some reason, they running at him with their guns out
The store owner saw he had a gun
So on the low he picked up the phone and he called "the one's"
And he ain't even have a chance
They would a bullets in his body, up and look like they made him dance
Shut down like a wanted man
Like his face on a wanted poster reward a hundred grand
Police killing niggas gotta stop
The next day in the headlines: "Another cop shot a cop"
They just thought he was another nigga
To their surprise, this nigga was a cop, he was undercover

[Chorus: Jasia'n]
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
Have a liquor store interests, alarm sound like "Don't Be a Menace"
Unarmed and defenceless, this killing is senseless
They claim he had a concealed weapon
That was just a paper bag with his Guinness he paid for
Still got shot with acuteness, everyday blackless
Black males on the hit list, filmed by eyewitness
Justice is blind, that bitch always find the pigs innocent
Yo, how was it legal to abuse me?
Bodega, choked me to death for a loosey
Make my brain bleed at the Wayne Greek (?)
I needed first aid at the right 'A'
Murdered for being black guy on bright day
Fuck dirty harry, crooked cop make my day
Cause if we targeted your children like that
You'd hate our race, cop, you already do that, bitch

[Chorus: Jasia'n]
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
Let's say I'm just an ordinary man, married and all
I'm a father, pay taxes, and I abide by the law
But damn, why I let my kid go to the store
Feels like, I just shipped him off to war
And I don't know if I'm ever gonna see him again
Or if some cop gonna kill him and take his freedom
My son is not gonna stand on you and take your beating
You a cop boy second, but first we men
Bless, full of youthfulness
Best thing I ever bought him was the bulletproof vest
Best thing I ever taught him: give what you expect
If I'm mourning by the morning It's gonna be some more death
And I swear on the bible as I testify
But turn that shit to the page that says a eye for a eye
I'm burning up a rage and I'm not gonna lie
Somebody gotta pay, gotta pay with their lives

[Chorus: Jasia'n]
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
Cops killing niggas at the liquor store
[Outro: sample of Eric Garner]
Get away [garbled] […] for what? Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. I’m tired of it. It stops today. Why would you…? Everyone standing here will tell you I didn’t do nothing. I did not sell nothing. Because every time you see me, you want to harass me. You want to stop me (garbled) Selling cigarettes. I’m minding my business, officer, I’m minding my business. Please just leave me alone. I told you the last time, please just leave me alone. please please, don’t touch me. Do not touch me
