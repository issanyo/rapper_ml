DJ Gatman, Get it Kid Sis
Uh oh chi-town you ain't ready for this one
I came back with a quickness
It's your girl, Kid sis
Like this, jump out yo skin

You can be from down south girl
Get on the floor rip it down and dis more
When this control better
I don't know who you fuckin' juke for

Flirtatious, I can't help myself
I'm faker than an old wig
My name is Kid Sis
I drink Cointreau and sip on the O E
(Old English)

Enough of this, that, and the third
'Cause I keep rockin' ahead of the curve
Get you some white Stacey Adams boo
Then you be lookin' real heard

Right now you look like a herb
Commonly known as a lame or a nerd
Gotta get your mind right gotta get your game tight
If you want it you heard

Juke yo, juke yo switchboard
Get caught up in a switchboard
This is how you switchboard
