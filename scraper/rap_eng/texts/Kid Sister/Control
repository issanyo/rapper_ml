Ladies in the front row touch them toes
Fellas in the back get the bank roll
Twerk, roll, stop, control
Twerk, roll, stop, control

On the band up, put your drink to the sky
Bartender, refill the wine
Then, then break and repeat the rhyme
Wanna, wanna freak and pick the Alpine
If you get Shamay for Alazae
Or Lisa, Angie, Canbraney
Or nobody if you ain't tryna stay poor
Everybody, that's what I came for
I'm a rider, that's why I play more
Juke, more bounce, more club, more wave core
A southsider, that's why I stay more thump, more clap, more bass, more flavor
You know, all the shit that we be on
What my baby hit me on, baby see me on
I stay dipped in Baby Phat and Benetton
Every day, all the time, chi-town every time

From the beach to the lot to the club to the grocery
Kid Sis run shit, don't hold me
Back man, nah man, I'm posted
Up in the VIP room, I got mimosas
Wanna let me flow, get down go 'head
We finna rock away just like Doug did
Badass kids birthdays at show biz
I bring the cake out, call me the hostess
If you make paper and your mug say mean
I might let you fucks with my team
Cause I'm a mamma jamma
My jam's been clean
I stays paid on the first and the 15th
It's like the sound of neighbors over your head
I got the erky-erky over the beat
It's like the kid so major making the ends
I got the jerky-jerk at the end of my sentence
