I got my own style and I got my own grace
I work my own angle, what you tryna say?
I got my own cut, means I stick my own green
And green eyed monsters be first on the scene

Like yellow foxes, eye's in the sky
Always flip quick like can I get a ride
Can you get a ride, man, can I get a spot?
I see you throwin' shade out the corner of my eye

I'm from the go, so I keep movin' on
From the freaks out night to the early morn
Blue motherfuckers done got me gone
And we ain't leavin' till I get some

I got my records, I got my own taste
Shoes Louis Vuitton, power suit, super cape
If you get to yappin' say it to my face
Dial 3 3 1 59 88, holla at me

D-d-don't step to me, get fresh with me
Don't step to me, get fresh with me
S-s-step to me, get fresh with me
G-g-get fresh with me, get fresh

G-g-get fresh with me
Don't step to me, get fresh with me
S-s-step to me, get fresh with me
G-g-get fresh, g-g-get fresh, get fresh with me

I got my own rhythm and I got my own bass
I got my own kickers and my merce say dace
Got 5 on the ride, baby, I got trace
Like she 99, gotta keep it grace

Work so shinin' but you didda's whinin'
Chillin' at the Superwards, checkin' out behind him
I got eye on them, man, I grind on them
Even pop that booty when I'm rhyamin'

That's right, I'ma learn ya how
I moved up and I got my own piece of pie
Not pizza pie but I got a good record
Like Domino's line outside for 5

So you wanna kick it to a down ass jo
When my man cold chillin' and my glasses on
Uh, I done told you don't call my phone
Only broke hoes creep on the low

So I got my own singles and I got my own cuts
Switchboard shucks and I got my own struts
I know you hear me comin' so you betta listen up
And get that ole style while we're pissin' out ya cup
Holla at me

D-d-don't step to me, get fresh with me
Don't step to me, get fresh with me
S-s-step to me, get fresh with me
G-g-get fresh with me, get fresh

G-g-get fresh with me
Don't step to me, get fresh with me
S-s-step to me, get fresh with me
G-g-get fresh, g-g-get fresh, get fresh with me
Get fresh

G-g-get fresh
Get fresh with me, get fresh
G-g-get fresh
Get fresh with me, get fresh

Get fresh
Get fresh
Get fresh
Get fresh
