Hi I’m Kid Sister and I’m stacking money
Drinking all night got you feeling right
Better get your right hand hi
Hi I’m Kid Sister and I’m stacking money
Drinking all night got you feeling right
Better get your right hand hi

I got my hand up I got it high
I got my gin, I got the Henn, I’m a drink all night
You rocking Pro wings, Davoucci coat
OK, you’s a little bootleg
Back it up and hit the floor

You gon get stolen on if you don’t get with the program
Handle it, bygones begone if you gon get on the plane I’m on

I think I’m ready to get mine
I think ya’ll ready to get high
I think ya’ll ready to ride
Better get that hand up

Hi I’m Kid Sister and I’m stacking money
Drinking all night got you feeling right
Better get your right hand hi
Hi I’m Kid Sister and I’m stacking money
Drinking all night got you feeling right
Better get your right hand hi

Where you from? South side
Where you from? West side
Everybody from the best side, I’m ripping the Midwest right?
Gotta keep that hand up high
You know I keep these nails nice
If you hear me holla, I gotta get that hand up
Hi I’m Kid Sister and I’m stacking money, drinking all night

Hi I’m Kid Sister and I’m stacking money
Drinking all night got you feeling right
Better get your right hand hi
Hi I’m Kid Sister and I’m stacking money
Drinking all night got you feeling right
Better get your right hand hi

Get that hand up, Get that hand up
Gotta get that hand up
Better get your right hand high
Get that hand up, Get that hand up
Gotta get that hand up
