I know you hear me comin' (4x)
You know I'm comin' when you hear that clickin'
Ain't no quittin' cause it ain't my stickin
If you know me then you know I love a Louboutin
All ?, got you shook n
A hundred thousand on ya wrist no kiddin?
A hundred thousand on ya chest, oh really?
Think I give a shit, naw don't be silly
So steleg tight flow to the ceiling
Keep doin what I'm doing
Keep movin how I'm movin
In the drop top crusin down the strip
I ain't gotta talk
I can prove that I'm a boss when I do it
Cause I floss like a muthafuckin pimp
I'm pullin out knots
While you pullin out lint
It ain't no stopping keep talkin that shit
They call you who knows and they call me princess
You ain't that hot put ya jacket on bitch
Love kisses
Lovin all the haters, don't be mad
Me and my girls just got it like that
Roll outta bed
Then pop them tags
Me and my girls just got it like that
Well show it off
Show it off, show it off
Like that (4x)
Go visit, so ?
Say it ain't so boy ya girl so gritty
Oh what a pity
Do it on my titty
Girl on ya dick
Oh oh oh really?
Wanna see the chevy
Shit so sickening
Pockets full of dough
Got hundreds and fifties
You can ask p
You can ask Drizzy
You can ask 'Ye
You can ask Driz-zay
Get ya out and in
Grapefruit belly
Holla at cha girl if ya wanna roll wit me
We can get some of that sticky icky
We can go together like Minnie, Mickey
Innie, outtie
Lamborghini, Ferrari
Sorry be there in a jiffy
Pedal to the medal
Stiletto in the back
CC the pedal won because I gotta scrap
Lovin all the haters, don't be mad
Me and my girls just got it like that
Roll outta bed
Then pop them tags
Me and my girls just got it like that
Ahshow it off
Show it off, show it off
Like that (4x)
