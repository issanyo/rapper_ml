I'm workin' out my business, I'm handlin' my business
I'm conducting a livin', not swan divin' in my britches
Players tryin' to get this, they look to offer kisses
Baby what you tryin' to do, f*** you I'm no pimpstress

I don't need no public aid 'cause I know I'm alright
All I need is laser rays and ___ satellites
I don't need you to buy no bar
I don't need you to drive no car
I'm a BFF ______

I don't mean to cause a ruckus
I don't fuss or fight
I don't need no introduction
All I need is a mic
All I do is press record
Then I get down on the floor
I don't really give no f*** is this what you've been waiting for?

Lookout weekend 'cause here I come
Because weekends were made for fun
X4

If ya try to get it in
You can teach the class
Can't be scared to hit the floor
Shake your ass

It's Kid Sister/ Nina Skye

Keep it fresh from A to Z
Get bilingual on this track
Can you follow me?

Let's go!
(spanish)
We get all the boys
We gonna keep you wantin' more
When we get down on the floor
Only do it our way, rock with us
Now what you waitin' for?

I don't mean to cause a ruckus
I don't fuss or fight
I don't need no introduction
All I need is a mic
All I do is press record
Then I get down on the floor
I don't really give no f*** is this what you've been waiting for?

Lookout weekend 'cause here I come
Because weekends were made for fun
