[Verse 1]
Said you were my baby
And your love was true
But as soon as I turn my back baby
Look what you go and do
Start sneakin' it, too
Usin' me like a fool
Now I know the deal
I could see right through you

[Hook]
I said, you ain't really down
Playin' those games you do
I said you ain't really down
Your love was never true, oooh

[Verse 2]
Woulda bet my life, with you all this time
That you were the one for me, baby
How could I be so blind
Gave you my love and you used and abused it
Broke my heart like there was nothing to it, oooh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No no no I said
You ain't really down
Playin' those games you do
I said, you ain't really down
Your love was never true
You ain't really down
Cause I know u been sneakin' around
Tellin' me lies, using alibis
And u think to yourself, I'm so sly
But the games to play won't work today
Cause I'll never believe another word you say
So I know the deal, you've been playin' the field
You just ain't for real
Gave you my love and you used and abused it
Broke my heart like there was nothing to it, oooh

[Hook]
