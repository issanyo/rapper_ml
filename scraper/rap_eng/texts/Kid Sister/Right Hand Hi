[Refrain]
Hi, I'm Kid Sister and I'm stackin' money
Drinkin' all night got you feelin' right
Better get your right hand hi
I'm Kid Sister and I'm stackin' money
Drinkin' all night got you feelin' right
Better get your right hand hi

[Verse 1]
I got my hand up, I, I got it high
I, I got my gin, I got that Henn, Ima drink all night
You, you rockin' Pro Wings, Davoucci coat
Ok, you's a little bootleg
Back it up and hit the floor
You gon get stolen on if you don't get with the program
Handle it, bygones begone if you gon get on the plane I'm on
I think I'm ready to get mine
I think ya'll ready to get high
I think ya'll ready to ride
Better get that hand up

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Yo girl ain't out the gutter
But your girl about to snap
D-d-d-did I stutter about to bounce and break yo' bed
That boy you gotta problem, holler at Dr. Phil
I put a little hurtin' on you
And I'll do it in some heels
Over and over Im rockin'
Pull it to the club but the sun was poppin'
Got a little land around the block
And ain't no stoppin now cause I ain't, so buddy buddy ain't gon' lie
I gotta gotta it all night
Aw suck it suck it na
Gotta get that hand up

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Now, where you from, South side
Where you from, West side
Everybody from the best side, I'm reppin' the Midwest right
Gotta keep that hand up high
You know I keep these nails nice
If you hear me holla I, gotta get that hand up high

[Refrain]

[Outro x3]
Get that hand up, get get get, get that hand up
Gotta get that hand up
Better get your right hand high
