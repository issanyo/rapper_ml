[Hook X2]
Bitches sitting on my lap kris kringle
Midnight skating in the trap kris kringle
Pull up in the bentley sledge kris kringle
Get it popping like a pringle whats the jingle

[Verse 1: RiFF RaFF]
Rap game jonny bravo, paint pictures like picasso
30 grand on the bottle, 4 million on the condo
Hustling in the cut, kawasaki full throttle
Keep a couple of gold models, cutting coke in toronto
Ima bring the rice, pour the syrup in my slice
Rap game neon space, turn heads like poltergeist
Marcus thousand for protection, triple beam pyrexing
All this jewellery I'm flexing, shut down the 5 way intersection
Mixing down the game, rap game herman cain
The way I swang the wood frame, figured I was candy john wayne
Off the chain, with convertible private planes
Drop invisible rain kris kringle defrane

[Hook X2]
Bitches sitting on my lap kris kringle
Midnight skating in the trap kris kringle
Pull up in the bentley sledge kris kringle
Get it popping like a pringle whats the jingle

[Verse 2: Kid sister]

Letâ€™s go
Kid Sister left hand flippin', sippin' syrup eggnog
Ball hog, Boss Hogg, whip it Kawasaki law
Pull up in something, damn, theyre extravagant Summer time, winter time, bitch you ain't no friend of mine
Bah, and Im ballinlike New Jersey-ness
Sweatpants, head tight , thats all Im gettinmy head blessed Scoopinup a couple mang, youre ballinon your foot civilians
Chinchilla jet skis, weasels at the Florida keys
No clouds in the everglades, glare shine like cascades
Skating on you bitches, I shoulda' brought some roller blades
Plus I pull a couple stunts, Suoer Dave
Mittens in the bat cave, peppermint that candy paint

Bitches sitting on my lap kris kringle
Midnight skating in the trap kris kringle
Pull up in the bentley sledge kris kringle
