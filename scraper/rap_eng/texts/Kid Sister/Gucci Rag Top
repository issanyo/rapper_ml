Go distract me, it was good to go!
Gucci rag top, Gucci rag top
With the Gucci, Gucci rag top!
With their Gucci, Gucci rag top!
With the... Gucci rag top!
Gucci rag top, bad socks...
On the damn zodiac
Swinging in my ear
Tripping...
Pocket full of cash, popping, popping tears
Yes, guess... Burn calorie
Damn, what's the name...
Looking, looking at your girl
Like I ain't never seen them!
No you haven't, I'm the baddest
And no bitch you can't have this!
... I'll put a rabbit on my hat like I was magic
I'll... while I hollow at your man!
Call yourself a cab, cause I'm calling outta...
He can't help it...
... in my Gucci rag top!
With the Gucci, Gucci rag top!
With their Gucci, Gucci rag top!
Gucci rag top, Gucci rag top!
Gucci, let's go!
Is Gucci mind the money...
Gucci got interior, haters are inferior
And I say it two times
Cause... Gucci two times
Gucci, Gucci...
It ain't nobody...
Ain't nobody... women
Ain't nobody...
Gucci!
