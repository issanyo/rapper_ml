(So you know ah, half of chi town is from missisipi anyway. My name is David Banner introducing Kid Sister)

Hold it there, Stop right there
Help your granny up out of her chair
If you wanna get goin say hell yeah, hell yeah
Everybody grab a beer
Now if i had 2 pennys every time i heard
My uncle say that we
I bet i'd be at least a thousandaire
I bet i'd have enough to last a whole year

So oh no dont say ain't say what i say
Which is jump double dutchin the driveway
Can you turn the jump rope the right way
Now the right way, and then they say
Its cool baby girl its cool
Dont trip cause we love you
Now dont make me pay for your own what we do
And make one for being mine too, cool?

Everybody stop what your doing
No crying, quit your boo hooing
Sun be shinin'

Barbequing
Its about to be a family reunion

X2

Uh oh, family reunion
Come on, family reunion
Sing my song, family reunion
All day long , everybodyy

Stop what your doing
No crying, quit your boo hooing
Sun be shinin'
Barbequing
Its about to be a family reunion

Fried chiken with some macaroni and cheese
I wish all my days vould be just like these
