It's kid sis - eh!

Ain't nobody out there makin' shit
Quite like me
Quite like this
Everbody and they Mama talkin'
My sins and tryin' to get sensitive
I'm Lil Fueco (sp?) 20-10
Can I get a witness
I don't wanna burst our bubble but
Grab a towel and throw it in
Throw it up
Rub your block
Rub your click
Rub your spot
Just worry bout you
Try to keep your cool
Imma keep my shit on lock
Nuh-uh don't make me crack a paper - read about it
So-oo you're gonna talk about it be about it

Chorus:
You big you bad
Kick it off go ahead
Imma back it up proper
We gets it all the way crackin' X2

You big you big
You big you big kick it X2

So if you big n bad kick it off go ahead X2

Okay - throw a little stank on it
If you in the mood
When the thuds go boom Imma pop my booty
Imma lose my mind
Cause that pioneer's (??) dick (?) and done did something to me
What you waitin' on
Maybe makin' on
Better jack it till your jacket come off - windbreak it
It's crowded in here, you're surrounded

The beat pounding, now just bang it
Supermarket, at the Target, your apartment
Don't really matter where you work it or who you in the car with
Better crack that winner cause the beat so gnarley
This shits retarded
I know you know I know thats right
So when it comes to rockin' it live
Imma just be like -

Chorus:
You big you bad
Kick it off go ahead
Imma back it up proper
We gets it all the way crackin' X2

You big you big
You big you big kick it X2

So if you big n bad kick it off go ahead X2

We keep it big - Tom Hanks (?)
We keep it bad - Insane
We keep it big, keep it bad
All day everyday X4

Chorus:
You big you bad
Kick it off go ahead
Imma back it up proper
We gets it all the way crackin' X2

You big you big
You big you big kick it X2

So if you big n bad kick it off go ahead X2
