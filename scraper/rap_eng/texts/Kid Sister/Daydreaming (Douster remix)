I can't miss

You know every time I think about you baby
It's like a movie in my head that drives me crazy
I try to fight it try to hide it can't contain it
So amazing
Like I'm daydreaming again

Like I'm daydreaming again (that's right that's right)
Like I'm daydreaming again (that's right that's right)
Like I'm daydreaming again (that's right that's right)
Like I'm daydreaming

You know the love I want to give you so untouchable
I wanna feel you gotta feel you wanna touch a soul
I wanna let you know the meaning of forever
We'll be here until ties we made are severed

Like I'm daydreaming again (that's right that's right)
Like I'm daydreaming again (that's right that's right)
Like I'm daydreaming again (that's right that's right)
Like I'm daydreaming again (that's right that's right)
Like I'm daydreaming

Daydreaming in love with you
Soon as I wake up I'mma do
Think about one thing we could do
Said maybe a weekend rendezvous
I meant you

Run around suckers like twenty-twos
I'm on to you
Try act cool like Fonzie do (ehh)
Warning you
Nookie transforming you
Running out to tell your crew
That I'm the truth
Be about it don't act new
Be about don't act new

I can't get enough of you baby
I need you so much that it's driving me crazy
Crazy (crazy)
Crazy (crazy)
Need you so much that it's driving me crazy
Crazy (crazy)
Crazy (crazy)
I need you so much
I need you
I need you

Like I'm daydreaming again
Like I'm daydreaming again
Like I'm daydreaming again
Like I'm daydreaming again
Like I'm daydreaming again
Like I'm daydreaming again
Like I'm daydreaming again
Like I'm daydreaming again
