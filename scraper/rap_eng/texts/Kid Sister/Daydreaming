It's like this, Kid Sis
Just like this, Kid Sis
I can't miss

[Verse 1]
You know every time I think about you baby
It's like a movie in my head that drives me crazy
I try to fight it try to hide it can't contain it
So amazin', like I'm daydreaming again

[Refrain]
Like I'm daydreaming again, that's right that's right
Like I'm daydreaming again, that's right that's right
Like I'm daydreaming again, that's right that's right
Like I'm daydreaming

[Verse 2]
You know the love I want to give you so untouchable
I wanna feel you gotta feel you wanna touch a soul
I wanna let you know the meaning of forever
We'll be here until ties we made are severed

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Daydreaming in love with you
Soon as I wake up I'mma do
Think about one thing we could do
Said maybe a weekend rendezvous
I meant you, run around suckers like twenty-twos
I'm on to you, try act cool like Fonzie do (ehh)
Warnin' you
Nookie transformin' you
Runnin' out to tell your crew
That I'm the truth
Be about it don't act new
Be about don't act new

[Bridge: Cee-Lo]
I can't get enough of you baby
I need you so much that it's driving me crazy
Crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy
Need you so much that it's driving me crazy
Crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy
I need you so much
I need you
I need you

Like I'm daydreaming again (x8)
