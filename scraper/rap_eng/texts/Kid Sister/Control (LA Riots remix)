Ladies in the front row touch them toes
Fellas in the back get the bank roll
Twirk, Roll, Stop, Control x2

On the band up put your drinks to the sky
Bartender refill the wine
Then, then break and repeat the rhyme
Wanna, wanna freak and pick the alpine
If you get Shamay for Alaze
Or Lisa, Angie, and Renee
Or nobody if you ain’t tryna stay poor
Everybody that’s what I came for
I’m a rider that’s why I play
More Juke, more bounce, more club, more wave core
A southsider, that’s why I stay more thump, more club, more bass
More flavor
You know, all the shit that we be on
What my baby hit me on, what my baby see me on
I stay dipped in baby phat and benetton
Every day, all the time, Chi-town every time

Ladies in the front row touch them toes
Fellas in the back get the bank roll
Twirk, Roll, Stop, Control x2

From the beach to the lot to the club to the grocery
Kid sis run shit don’t hold me
Back man, nah man, I’m posted
Up in the vip room, I got mimosas
Wanna let me flow,get down go ahead
We finnin’ to rock away just like Joe did
Badass kids birthdays and show biz
I bring the cake out, call me the hostess
If you make paper and your mug say mean
I might lets you ***** with my team
Cuz I’m a mamma jamma
My jams been clean
I stays paid on the first and the 15th
It’s like the sound of neighbors over your head
I got the erky-erk over the beat
It’s like the kid so major making the ends
I got the jerky-jerk at the end of my sentence

Ladies in the front row touch them toes
