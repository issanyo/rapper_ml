Chorus

Ocean Symphony

I don't need your love x 6

Im tripping as i stand here/
Wanted to make it better/
Seen it all unfold/
Id thought id make amends but../
Where theres war theres no love no x2/

Wordsmith:

Problems always pointing at people pushing my buttons/
Im puffin and yea im buzzin the answer with no discussion/
Im banging with no percussion/
A shark you must be bluffing/

Ryanito:

Tough man always something but trust me it mean nothing/
Hit em while they huffin/
Baby mama cousin baking muffins/
Look at them they muggin/
Can't bear me teddy ruckspin/
Over and above but they never give the love/

Wordsmith:

And then they never do it proper/
The chief rocka don't hear nada/
Hear a lot of noise in my ear dog you not my father/

Ryanito:

Let me disrespect the fucking record even farther/
This invasion no persuasion just in case you claiming barter/
Phasing all these patients and they saying im the doctor/

Wordsmith:

Stay steady/
I stay ready/
Its so petty/
No confetti its not belly so don't tell me/
See im blowing some steam/
Filling my bloodstream/
Going off the edge i pledge so don't intervene/
Leave it all in the booth/
The truth to the roots/
Hood to the suits/
Me and ryan in cahoots/
Hate heres the proof/
Hate thats the truth/
Feel the hate thats the proof/

Chorus

Ryanito:

I don't need your love validation ain't my preference/
Reverend with a severance staying open to suggestions/
You lived it like i lived then tell me why you second/
Grace the tracks and place descending angels from the heavens/

Wordsmith:

Not the one to intimidate/
I imitate the best/
See my message gonna penetrate/
My people gonna march theres a lot that is at stake/
Tryna save face looking like the next Ma$e/

Ryanito:

Mad fake/
Break apart like a crab cake/
Finish with a tad bake/
And stab em where the track break/
Masked mate with a rag inside the gas tank/
Flash may crack em in the ass with my last take/

Wordsmith:

Catch fade/
My bars blades/
The boy blaze/
Leave em sideways/
Crying in them hallways/
Got em bleeding, and your believin i need a reason/
All im seeing is hate in your eyes so why the hell you speaking/

Ryanito:

Feasting on this beat/
Leave the spirit while im creeping/
Rhymes will make you not feel your face like the weekend/
Invoke my inner dragon tag and leave you leaking/
Baltimore my hope like preakness/
Peep this/
Cuz i don't need your love/
I don't need your fakeness dude/
I don't wanna carry weight when im the one who's breaking through/
Oooh. i see the look you making too/
Check it how i break it down and fuck what you relate it to/
Cuz i don't need your love/
No i don't need your love/
