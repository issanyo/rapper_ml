[Hook : Ross]
I ain't alright
She with another guy
Got me feeling things inside
Yeah I know its been awhile
These are things on my mind
I'm just speaking from my mind
Oh

[Verse 1 : Ross]
Was it the commas baby?
Was it the money babe?
You lie to me then, you lie to me now
What did I do to deserve this?
All I wanna know, where do we stand?
Going where you go, that's what we planned
You ain't the girl you use to be
This ain't the world that it use to be
Moving I moved on, hoping that you'll understand
Moving I moved on, hoping that you'll understand oh

Is you that I've been searching for
Can't keep on going back and forth
I need you girl to come back home
Won't let you, won't let you go

[Hook : Anthony Parker]

[Verse 2: Anthony Parker]
You got you a new man, shit

He flexing cause he got a new whip
He cheating but still you don't do shit
Oh man, oh man
Take time with your imperfections
Yeah I know that you the best selection
You the fucking realest yeah you never stressing
Nah you never stressing
I heard your type, now your nigga jealous
Now your nigga jealous, what a first impression
Told your ass I'm the best selection
Okay I'm guilty, I acted hella reckless
I want diamonds and you want love
I need someone that I can trust
All these girls, no no no
All these women ain't the ones yeah

I hit em up when I'm bored and I'm all alone
And they busy, bust blowing up my phone
