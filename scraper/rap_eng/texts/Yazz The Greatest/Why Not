No, you can't stop it

You know I'm poppin'
Option no other option
I gotta pop this

All this time, I thought
Fallin' was breakin'
But I was mistaken

I did that, out of the ashes
A star in the makin'
I'm thrivin'

Steady survivin' while
Y'all just gettin' by
No need to fake it to make
It, cuz the money never lie

(Never Lie)

All these blessin'
Let me testify

All these doors that open
I prefer 'em suicide
