[Verse 1]
Fellas if you clever, trust a lady never
Have you thinkin' back and wishin' that you never met her
See her in that fitted dress and you know it's designer
She fill it out nice, but the devil wears Prada
So no, no, no, I will never ever trust her mayne
Get out my way chick cause' I already know the game
If you tryna' talk to me, I'm on my college football
In other words, I'mma act like I don't Norte Dame
Cause you been known to play the field like Norte Dame
I hate ya' face, hate ya' style, just to make it plain
Back then they told me Trix are for kids
And you been layin' on your back tricks told me ever since
Ha, I thought I had it all made
'Til you left me on my own, like Lebron did Wade
I ain't trippin' off these broads, man I'm goin' get paid
They goin' learn in a minute cause they all gettin' slayed

[Hook]
I don't trust 'em
Man these broads ain't about nothin'
Don't call me, no text, no discussion
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
Stand too long, getcha' seat tookin'
Stab you right in the back, soon as you ain't lookin'
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
I don't, I don't trust 'em
I don't, I don't, I don't trust 'em, no

[Verse 2]
If I drowned I believe you will leave me there floatin'
I wouldn't trust you to throw a rock in the ocean
Speakin' of water, you fluid with the foolishness
Just like H2O, without the 2 in it
Damn these women all about the drama these days it be hella hard to even trust your mama these days
Gotta watch my back, might get jacked
Make the wrong move, I just might get capped
Bump that, I'm on a killin' spree
I gotta keep the flow tight
I never heard of breastfeeding venom in my whole life
I guess that's just the meaning that we all know about
You brought me in this world and you take me right out
Right, right
Wicked witch of the land
Middle finger to a chick whoever sabotage a man
Cause ya'll goin' learn today, ya'll goin learn today
Go to hell with gasoline and you burn right away, ow

[Hook]
I don't trust 'em
Man these broads ain't about nothin'
Don't call me, no text, no discussion
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
Stand too long, getcha' seat tookin'
Stab you right in the back, soon as you ain't lookin'
They all phony and that's why I don't trust 'em
I don't, I don't trust 'em
I don't, I don't, I don't trust 'em, no
