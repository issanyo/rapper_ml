[Chorus]
Fuck if you like me
I don't give a fuck if you don't like me
Fuck if you like me
I don't give a fuck if you don't like me (Bitch)

[Bridge]
I just turned nothing to something
And you don't like me making assumptions
Change on me, don't change on me, don't change on me, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

[Verse]
I came with the bag and I came with the work
All of you niggas be wishing the worst
Cut that bitch off if she ain't really with it
I just hit up Kevin he said he got bitches
Young nigga came up from nothing
I turned into something and you niggas be bluffing
Talking that cash in your music but really you niggas don't be having nothing (woah)
Coming for the title
I'm my only rival
Keep on getting money it's a never ending cycle
I know, I know, moving like I do
She know, she know, moving with the crew
Yuh, yea, I swear all these niggas they tried it
Fresher than motherfucking Trident
Your bitch all on me like a trolley

[Chorus]
Fuck if you like me
I don't give a fuck if you don't like me
Fuck if you like me
I don't give a fuck if you don't like me (Bitch)
