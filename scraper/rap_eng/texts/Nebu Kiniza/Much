[Hook]
I ain't gotta do too much (much)
I swear that these niggas, they be doing too much (doin to much)
I ain't gotta do too much(no, no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
I just did 200 on a backstreet
Now I'm ballin' out like a athlete (swish)
Every time I cook it up yea it relax me
I let her ride my dick like I'm a taxi (by my side)
By my side is my ride or die, she gonna ride or die
We gonna slide every time we ride we going out tonight
Got the coke yea, gotta go, we be on the road
On the roll yea, on a row, could we take a toast?

[Hook x2]
I ain't gotta do too much (much)
I swear that these niggas, they be doing too much (doin to much)
I ain't gotta do too much(no, no, no, no)

I ain't gotta do too much (much)
I swear that these niggas, they be doing too much (doin to much)
I ain't gotta do too much(no, no, no, no)


[Verse 2]
I roll up a blunt and it relax me
I be coolin' back yea in the back seat
Chauffeured up, In the Hills when im coolin'
When I'm off the Hennessy yea they be choosin'
Gotta use my mind all the time yea
I been on my grind, let the pain go
If I'm in the Rarri then my nigga in a Range Rov
You know how the thing go, You know how the thing go

[Hook 2x]
I ain't gotta do too much (much)
I swear that these niggas, they be doing too much (doin to much)
I ain't gotta do too much(no, no, no, no)

I ain't gotta do too much (much)
I swear that these niggas, they be doing too much (doin to much)
I ain't gotta do too much(no, no, no, no)
