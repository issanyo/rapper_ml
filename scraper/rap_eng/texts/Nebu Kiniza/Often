[Verse 1]
We fed the whole town up
Money on the flo'
Bitches everywhere
Man I need some mo'
Drugs up out my system
Gotta sober some mo'
She told me I cannot leave
She told me I need some sleeves
Shut up, hoe
Gotta get some mo'
Gotta get some dough
Turn up with my bros
I don't need no hoe
I just need some bread
Fuck it gimme that head
Fuck it gimme that head, ouu
I've been talking cash talk
I'm about to blast off
'Bout to cop me a NASCAR
I'm taking off like NASA

[Pre-Chorus]
Ouu, nah, nah
Ouu, nah, nah, nah
Ouu, nah, nah, naaah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Fucking bad bitches, yeah that's often
Come and pull up at my crib, yeah that's often yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I gotta keep runnin' up
Gotta keep me a new sack
Spend it, I make it right back
Bitch, I'm feelin' safe
Bitch, I'm feelin' great
Got yo' main bitch
I swear she be feeding me grapes (wassup)
She sweeter than a grape
I took yo' girl on a date
I put my girl on a break
Fuck any bitch that I want to
Came in the game with a good tune
Started off rapping on YouTube
Now all of this money I'm new to
You know I'm a star now
They be tryna' take it from me
You know I'm a star now
And I got insured now

[Chorus]
Countin' big stacks, yeah that's often
Fucking bad bitches, yeah that's often
Come and pull up at my crib, yeah that's often yeah, yeah
Countin' big stacks, yeah that's often
Fucking bad bitches, yeah that's often
Come and pull up at my crib, yeah that's often yeah, yeah
