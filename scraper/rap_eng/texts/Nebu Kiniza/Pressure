[Chorus]
Baby don't wait up for me
I've been up sitting lonely now
I got all the pressure on me
People on me won't let you down
And I know how shit goes
And i'm on it
You know i'm on it
And I know how shit goes
And i'm on it
You know i'm on it

[Verse 1]
I put in the work
Make them go berserk
Smoking on the perc
Bitch i'm off the earth
Yea we sliding
Yea you know we riding
They can't even catch me they thought they had left me

[Chorus]
Baby don't wait up for me
I've been up sitting lonely now
I got all the pressure on me
People on me won't let you down
And I know how shit goes
And i'm on it
You know i'm on it
And I know how shit goes
And i'm on it
You know i'm on it

[Verse 2]
I've been overthinking
But I got to keep it [?]
On the highway i'm shifting
Highway i'm shifting
I can never wait
A lot on my plate
But I got what it takes
But I got what it takes
Yea, and it's the story of my life
I've been trying to get back right
Had to blow up like a whistle
I've been on a mission
I just had to listen

[Chorus]
Baby don't wait up for me
I've been up sitting lonely now
I got all the pressure on me
People on me won't let you down
And I know how shit goes
And i'm on it
You know i'm on it
And I know how shit goes
And i'm on it
You know i'm on it
