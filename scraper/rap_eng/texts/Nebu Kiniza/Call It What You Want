Came through to the party I was turning up
Then I met this love shawty we stop running up
Rooftop we was all up on the clouds now everything ago and it's going down right now
Tell me what your name is
She asked me if I'm famous
Let's go party like some rock stars
Middle fingers to cop cars no one else can stop us
