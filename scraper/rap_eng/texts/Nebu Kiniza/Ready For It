[Verse 1]
Yeah
Took a shot to the head, bitch I'm going insane
Double my cup when I sip on the drank
Been on the low, tryna stack up some more
Bitch I been on it, I'm flyer than most
Been on my job, oh no, I can't complain
Been on the jet, oh no, I can't do planes
Hope you get the picture, I been in the frame
Got some high standards, I can't be with lames
I been up and down cruisin' through the southside
And I'm on the way to the North
I put in the work like a chore
I gotta go in, never bored
I'm throwing that shit overboard
I'm giving my day to the Lord
I'ma go and get it of course

[Hook]
Motion
Going through the motions
All these damn emotions got me fucking roller coastin'
Motions
Going through the motions
All these damn emotions got me fucking roller coastin'

[Verse 2]
I just came from L.A. now I'm back to the A
Gotta go hard for the shit that I say
Gotta work hard every day, never play
Been on my job, oh no, they can't relate
I know you believe everything that I say
I gotta go in, oh no, I cannot stay
I'ma go in and make my way
Ice on my wrist shining bright in her face (Go!)
I been on the low for a minute
Now I got a bag, now I'm worth a couple tickets
(?) at the proper, oh no, I can't ever miss it
I been in the studio, I'm cooking in the kitchen
They be on my Gram' looking at the way that I'm living
Got them hatin' man, these pussy niggas livin' (?)
Every week I'm in killing the show
Nigga chill out, we done with your hoe

[Hook]
Motion
Going through the motions
All these damn emotions got me fucking roller coastin'
Motions
Going through the motions
All these damn emotions got me fucking roller coastin'

[Outro]
Oh no they not ready for it
Ready for it
Oh no they not ready for it
Ready for it
Oh no they not ready for it
Ready for it
Oh no they not ready for it
Ready for it
