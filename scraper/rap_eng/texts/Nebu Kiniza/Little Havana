It's not a mistake, I don't eat no steak
Bitch I am a vegan i'ma try this for few days
And i'm getting money yea you know I stay paid
Gotta stay paid
Gotta stay prayed up
Fighting off the demons gotta shake em off my shoulder
Bitch i'm breaking down them boulders
Counting Ms onto Ms
Ns to the Ns
And I gotta get it from start to the end
Locked in, locked in, bitch i'm locked in
Counting money fast bitch i'm plotting
And I save the bank 'cus i'm investing
I put in the stock and now i'm flexing

Big bank take little bank got it on me oh no it's not a mistake now
Big bank take little bank bitch I got it on me oh no it's not a mistake now
Big bank take little bank bitch I got it on me oh no it's not a mistake now
Big bank take little bank bitch I got it on me oh no it's not a mistake now
