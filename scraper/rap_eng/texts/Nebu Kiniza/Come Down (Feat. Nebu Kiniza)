[Intro: Nebu Kiniza]
Yeah, yea
Tell me what's good, tell me whats good
Tell me what's good, tell me whats good
Tell me whats good with ya, tell me whats good
Yeah

[Verse 1: Nebu Kiniza]
I be so high I'm never coming down
I be around the town when I drive around
ATL shorty better show some love
Better believe that I'm up in it
Running through the scrimmage
I get high for me, these niggas do it for a image
Living with no limit, No time for no gimmick
I came from the bottom, now I got em where I need em
She told me she love me, yeah I got her, I don't need her
Rolling up some good medical
Laying back, eating all the edibles
Got like four different shows, different hoes
Out of control, tell me something that I don't know
I'm never sober, gotta stay high
Your girl love me cause I stay fly
Hippy Nigga from the Eastside
Tell me do you wanna ride

[Hook: Berry Bonkers]
When I come down on my high
I just look up to the sky
Can you see the all seeing eye
Can you see the all seeing eye
I done came down on my high
I dream of me lost in my ride
She fuck with me low on the vibe
Up on the vibe, when I come down off my high

[Verse 2: Berry Bonkers]
When I come down off my high
You should let me 6-9 with your soul
I had clouded vision on my paper mission
Can I find a way to make it grow
I had perfect attendance every time you needed it
You knew I would show
Let the story unfold, best story unwrote
Nobody know cause the story untold, yea
I use to wanna stunt with you
Now I either smoke a blunt or I just get blunt with you
Panties on the floor, don't let the door hit you
Gotta roll you some more
Got me some drinks from the store
Keeping my double cup poured up
Hold up, we moving fast but I'm so slowed up
I just told her bout the Soufside
I'm hoping that she come down, come down
I'll get her so high that she won't come down anytime soon
Say hello to Jackie Blue, I miss Suzy too
I ain't seen you in a minute but you still on my mind
I know I just might give you my time
I depend on you to get me high
Keep you right by my side when I come down off my high

[Hook: Berry Bonkers]
When I come down on my high
I just look up to the sky
Can you see the all seeing eye
Can you see the all seeing eye
I done came down on my high
I dream of me lost in my ride
She fuck with me low on the vibe
Up on the vibe, when I come down off my high

[Verse 3: Rich Logan]
When I come down off my high, yea
I can start to see the signs, yea
I can read between the lines, yea
I can probably feel a different vibe
Take a leap of faith inside my mind
Lord knows I didn't know what I was in for
So I'm locking up the game, I got these bitches in a choke
That gas I gotta make it flip
Its coming straight off the banana boat
She came down cause she said she fuck with me the long way
She came down cause she said she fuck with me the long way
