[Intro: Nebu Kiniza]
Yeah (x14), uh

[Verse 1: Nebu Kiniza]
I get money by myself
I've been doing it by myself
All day, every day
Grind hard, with no help
What you mean? 3rd degree
Burn slow, let it melt
I barely keep people around me
I got 10 blunts to myself
I smoke the good kush when I'm in LA
Bitches coming in, I tell 'em "andale"
Let's have a good time, yeah, you know
I get served up something after every show, every show
First thing first, can't take no vacations
First thing first, gotta beat them court cases
Got Mimosa in my bottle with a model and she sucking fucking
Rolling off a half a bean, I told her lets go hit the streets

[Hook: Nebu Kiniza]
I smoke kush by myself
I get money by myself
I get bitches by myself
And I make movies by myself
I smoke kush by myself
I get money by myself
I get bitches by myself
And I make movies by myself
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it by myself
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it by myself

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen and  Key!]
I'm in the room by myself, I do them shrooms by myself
Had to cook my own meal, cause I am the super chef
I'm making moves by myself, I'm with your boo by myself
Boot up by my damn self, get this loot up by myself
All my bitches bad when I'm in the Bay
You know I got the best gas in the whole A
You know I do the dash if i'm zooted, ay
Real nigga 'bout my life like movie, ay
In the traphouse by myself, I keep the tool on the shelf
I might stop serving after 12 if it ain't for my wealth
I grab the tool out of the shelf, and I put it by my belt
Hey, I don't wanna make that move, cause that move bad for your health
But I sell coke by myself and I sell dope by myself
I be on my own team and I coach by myself
Riding 'Rari by myself, I do Ferrari by myself
Fuck your old bitch, she can be sorry by herself

[Hook: Nebu Kiniza]
I smoke kush by myself
I get money by myself
I get bitches by myself
And I make movies by myself
I smoke kush by myself
I get money by myself
I get bitches by myself
And I make movies by myself
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it by myself
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it by myself

[Verse 3: Nebu Kiniza]
Never had no patience waiting for nobody
I feel like the major when I'm in the party
Bruce Wayne, Liu Kang, kick it like karate
I can take your bitch and bend it like Pilates
1 to the 2, 3 to the 4
Run to the money when I swing my door
Got 2 fine bitches in the back seat
Of the banshee, with the blue cheese, no 10 piece
Everybody wanna talk that shoulda coulda woulda
I'm a young go getta, gotta get it by the second
Every minute I'mma flip it like a quarter
I'mma gone and fuck ya daughter
I'mma get it, I'mma get it, I'mma get it
Can't waste no time, I'mma fuck your dime
I'mma get my pockets bigger than a ramada
Jump on the front row, seat on the front row
Jump in the game like rah-rah-rah-rah
I'm a young hippie nigga
Float like a bubble bee, smoke like a chimney
Bitch name Tiffany, she love sucking me
Every day, every day, all night, hey
She gon' act a fool on the dick
She gon' act a fool on the dick like this, hey
She gon' act a fool on the dick
She gon' act a fool on the dick like this, hey

[Hook: Nebu Kiniza]
I smoke kush by myself
I get money by myself
I get bitches by myself
And I make movies myself
I smoke kush by myself
I get money by myself
I get bitches by myself
And I make movies myself
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it by myself
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it by myself
