Gassed up I be so gassed up
Turnt up I be so turnt up right now
Bad bitch super thick
That's the way I like it
I know all about your tricks
So don't you fucking try it
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Let me get this bread
All I want is a crib and a Superhead (Becky!)
Yeah I'm good, yeah I'm good
Don't you worry bout me

While I'm counting money
I be leaning, we be moving
We be dreaming, you'll be losing
And I know what she like, I know what she want, I know what she want

Everywhere I go they be like yeah what happened
Looking like a check, I can't even flex
Give me my respect

Ain't no stopping, got it going, cop it
All up in my cockpit, she just want what's poppin
Aye that ain't nothing to a young G
