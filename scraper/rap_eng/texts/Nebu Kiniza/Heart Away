[Intro]
I've been living yah, ahh
Ride, rolling in the summer
Yea, yea

[Chorus]
I've been living off a high
Cooling all summer
Baby leave tonight
You know he a bummer
Everybody is the same
But i'm a different lover, lover, lover
Baby don't give your heart away
'Cus I know you really wanna stay
Baby don't give your heart away, yea, yea

[Verse]
When i'm all alone
Sometimes on the phone
I'm drunk dialing you
Tryna find love tonight
Yea, i'm tryna find love tonight
Tryna find love tonight
I got my heart on my sleeve
If you don't trust me you can leave
Baby girl please let me breathe
I know that you see from beneath
But I got to get to the cheese
All of my niggas say preach
I got my wall up, can't breach
Don't know how to love, can you teach
Double up on the love and I put it on my shoulder
I swear everyday I have been getting colder
Baby girl don't fuck me over
You know that I am a soldier
But you know me well, oh yea I could tell
Fuck me good inside a hotel
I can make you come out of your shell

[Chorus]
I've been living off a high
Cooling all summer
Baby leave tonight
You know he a bummer
Everybody is the same
But i'm a different lover, lover, lover
Baby don't give your heart away
'Cus I know you really wanna stay
Baby don't give your heart away, yea, yea ,yea
Baby don't give your heart away
'Cus I know you really wanna stay
Baby don't give your heart away, yea, yea ,yea
