[Verse 1]
I got a lot on my mind, and I gotta go get it
I did a 360 in it, 2 door coupe the roof is missing
I be sliding and swerving, I'm catching waves on the surface
I walk up in it being me, they think I'm flexing on purpose (yeah, woah hey)
I came in the game just to fuck it up
I made my own beat just to fuck it up
I'm running my shit like an armor truck
Tell me really who could fuck with us
These niggas be all in they feelings
Yeah really they actin' like bitches
But that shit ain't none of my business
I hopped in this bitch and start living (yeah yeah)
Ain't nothing changed I'm still in my lane and I'm coming to get it
Fuck all the fame nigga I been the realest
Hop in the whip and I whippidie whip it (yeah, yeah)
Fuck what you heard gotta go get it my nigga yeah word
Fuck all the mixes I'm all about work
Ain't signing no papers cuz I know my worth. (yeah)
I'm coolin I'm coolin I'm coolin
I'm boolin I'm boolin I'm boolin
I'm talking that guapa I'm talking that moolah I gotta go, I gotta gooo...
They slept on a nigga for long enough
I got all my shit now they woken up
I'm ready to drop all this fucking heat
Fuck all these niggas I'm doing me

[Pre-Hook]
I got money in my convos
I don't wanna talk to you, now get lost hoe

Make the bitches wanna holla
If you gettin' to the money say aye (aye)

[Hook]
I'll be looking real good when I hop out
Ill be looking real good when I hop out
Ill be looking real good when I hop out
I'll be talking real cash when I hop out

[Verse 2]
Killin’ it killin’ it killin’ it
Lean like Red Bull when I’m sipping it
Peelin’ I’m peelin’ im peelin’ off
Fuck up on a bitch then I’m jumping off
Get money get money get money
I’m living the life that I wanted
I do what I want, I fuck who I want
I don’t give fuck who I’m ‘bove
Nigga  I can show you better than I tell you
She in love with diamonds, creepin’ bitch I smell you
You say that you know me, you don’t look familiar
All this drippin’ off me, my sauce is on the menu
I’m zooted I’m booted I’m ready
Ain’t nothing you niggas can tell me
Keeping it moving along
She tell me she love all my songs
She diggin’ it diggin’ it diggin’ it
She know that I got all the recipes
Smoking the grass for the remedies
I fuck on your bitch in your melodies

[Pre-Hook]
I got money in my convos
