[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Run, run, run, run, run
Clap your hands, y'all know what this is, so so Def

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Now lil mama just break it down
For the boy Bow Wow and that boy Chris Brown
All I wanna do is see you take it to the ground, bring it up slow
Twerk that thang like them girls in the videos
And I'm leaving here with something
I come with that good game baby girl I ain't fronting
I got that Bentley GT parked outside
So scream at a nigga when you're ready to ride, come on

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Let me talk to you, tell you how it is
I was thinking when I saw that body gotta get shawty, tell her what the young boy gon' do
Damn them chicks with you, gotta be your kin
Baby pretty thick with the kick that's sick that need to be hit, so tell me what y'all gon' do

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got friends and you got friends, they hop out, and you hop in
I look fly and they jocking, the way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop
I got friends and you got friends, they hop out, and you hop in
I look fly and they jocking, the way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
You'll see, girl I can set you off, don't believe my age is gonna slow us down
I can definitely show you things to have you saying I can't be 16
Once I get in you won't wanna go, and I, I'll have the girls wishing they were you, and I
I know you heard about me, but guess what's going down if we leave

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I got friends and you got friends, they hop out, and you hop in
I look fly and they jocking, the way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop
I got friends and you got friends, they hop out, and you hop in
I look fly and they jocking, the way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Girl you feel right, feel right, make me feel like, feel like
I wanna do a little something, do a little something, ain't no thing let you do it for sure
Girl the way that you're wearing them jeans is turning me on
I'm the hottest thing that's in these streets so baby won't you rock me?

[Verse 4: Bow Wow]
Now if ya man ain't on the floor then I'mma step in, replace him
Tell yo friends after party at my spot, shawty gotta come back cause she so hot
Now we looking for them grown girls that ain't scared to get to it, know what to do when we drop that music
Lil mini shirts cause she looking good, got different colour weaves mayne she so hod
I like 'em thick in the waist, ten in the face, the girls come to us so we don't chase
She move her booty like a lowrider, up, down, man she likes the way that I puts it down
And ain't nothing to a G, I do this on the daily, you don't believe me, you can ask JD
And it ain't no second guessing man, matter fact baby girl I got one question now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it
Is ya man on the floor? If he ain't, lemme know
Let me see if you can run it, run it, girl indeed I can run it, run it
