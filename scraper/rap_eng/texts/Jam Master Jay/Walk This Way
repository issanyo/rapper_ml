[Verse 1 : Run-D.M.C]
Now there's a backseat lover, that's always undercover
And we talk 'til my daddy say
Said you ain't seen nothing, 'til you're down on a muffin
And there's sure to be a change in ways
Now there's a cheerleader, that's a real big breeder
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving, was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this!

[Hook : Run-D.M.C]
See-saw swinging, with the boys in school
And her feet are just fly up in the air
Singing, "Hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle"
And they swinging like it just didn't care
So I took a big chance, At the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me, she was foolin'
Cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way!
She told me to

[Chorus : Steven Tyler]
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
(She told me to)
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Well just gimme a kiss
Oooh, like this!

[Verse 2: Run-D.M.C]
School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt climbing way up her knee
It was three young ladies, in the school gym locker
And they find they were looking at D
I was high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til a boy told me something I missed
That my next door neighbor, had a daughter had a favor
So I gave the girl a little kiss, like this

[Hook : Run-D.M.C., Steven Tyler and Rick Rubin]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With her feet flying up in the air
Singing, "Hey diddle diddle, with a kitty in the middle"
I was swinging like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
When she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to

[Chorus:  Steven Tyler and Rick Rubin]
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
(She told me to)
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Well just gimme a kiss
