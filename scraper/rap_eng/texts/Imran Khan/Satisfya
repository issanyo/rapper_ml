Gaddi Lamborghini peele rang di
Menu kendi ay chala ve slowly
Oh pehle gear te jadon mordi
O menu lagni ay the one and only
Ay ay bechare mundeyan de dilaan di tu quaatil
Vekhade meny kiven javengi tu faster
Dub de tu gas ni a little bit harder a bit harder yo
I'm a ridah, providah
Bring the heat girl
I'ma bring the fire
And my name keeps staring worldwide now
So my job is to
Satisfy yaaa (aaa, ay, satisfy aaa, ai)
Call me call me mr makaveli
I make em disappear just like harry Houdini
Ve ni me lyrically so insane ah
So ah meri chest te chain ah
Sanu na kise di vi cheez di Problem
Kehne lok they see me as a problem
Samaj menu na aave menu ki ay problem
I give them a cure with a fresh new album
I'm a ridah providah
Bring the heat girl
I'ma bring the fire
And my name keeps staring worldwide now
So my job is to
Satisfy yaaa (aaa, ay, satisfy aaa, ai)
Knox Artiste:
You got me tearin this roof into the ground yeah
You got me taking all the chances now
I gotta keep going all 'cos your love is true
All i want is to see that smile on you

[Bridge]
Let me tell you how it's going down tonight
Imma show you how a good time feels like
Everybody hold-on to your drinks now
Imma bring to your feet on the floor now
Move your body to the beat like this
Baby girl move your body like that
Come on real slow and set it to top
Its a brown boy drop @ the brown boy shop
