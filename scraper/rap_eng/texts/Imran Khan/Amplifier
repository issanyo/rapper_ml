[Barz]
Its the intro off the tape so go ahead and start to hate/
For my people in the states and the ones could relate/
Barz and Imran Khan yall representing all of yall/
And I'm here to start it off if you think i've fallen off/
My lyrics spittin bullets while others be spittin bullshit/
You wonder how does he do it adapting to different music
Uh and my ambition as a ridah /
Burning off the fuel whenever im spitting fire
Best bengali rapper son you know I got the title/
Barz and Lion G reppin Desi Desciples
Stormin like an army son you know we got the rifles/
Prior to a legend son you wish your on my level/
High above the pedastol, at the T O P
And I got her going low when she rides to the beat
So amplify it up and throw your drinks up/
Imran khan take the crowd let these people know whats up!

[Imran Khan]
Kaaliyan Bariyaan ve gadiyaan nu main lawaan
(I'll add black tinted windows to my cars)
Speed main do so vee di challan
(I would ride at a speed of 220)
Police de saamney main nahi rukda
(I don't halt in front of the police
I'm a night rider)
Brakeaan maar maar tire di main cheek kadhda
(Repeatedly hitting the brakes I make the tires screech)
Sare loki takde ve ki ho gaya
(Everybody looks this way to see what happened (i.e. they are stunned by the screeching sound)
Lagda ve enj mera dil ruk gya
(Seems like my heart stopped beating)
Ohnu mai puchda
(I ask her..)

Ni gaddi sadi beh ja ni jattiye

Ni tour tenu le ja, ve arriye
(I'll take you on a tour, you stubborn one.)
Ni woofer tu meri , meri
(You're my woofer , mine)
Main tera amplifier , fier
(And) I'm your amplifier , fier

[Imran Khan]
Jaandi ai club , das tere ki irade?
(Would you like to go clubbing , what are your plans?)
DJ nu puch ke lawavaan tere gaane
(I'll ask the DJ to play your favorite songs)
Le jaan main le jaan tenu jithe vi tu chaaven
(I'll take you wherever you want to go)
Ik wari aa ve mood bana ve
(Come once and set the mood) x2

[Hook]
Ni gaddi sadi beh ja ni jattiye
(Sit in my car hey Jatti)
Ni tour tenu le ja, ve arriye
(I'll take you on a tour, you stubborn one.)
Ni woofer tu meri , meri

Main tera amplifier , fier

Fresh off the block ATL is where im at/
And you know that its a wrap when tha barz starts to rap/
Its that doraville feel I got my city on my back/
Representing all the desi's put my people on the map/
So my niggas where yall at? its that night time flow/
Watch the dark knight rises son you know im on my own/
Gettin ladies in the zone your girl numbers on my phone/
When I text her is she home? she tells me yeah shes alone/
OH! man these dudes ain't nothin to me/
Im shreddin beats for that cheese they callin me swizz beatz/
I was gone for a while everybody know they miss me/
Speedin through the city tinted windows can you see me?/
Blast my shit loud while you rollin up a loud/
Till you can't hear a sound too faded for these crowd/
So nigga pass the crown, and crown your new king/
Its that four letter word B A to the R Z
