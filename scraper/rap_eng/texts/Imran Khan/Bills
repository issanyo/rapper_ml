[Verse 1]
Gal the way you move so cold
She don't know the face, but she know my name
Heard me on the radio
And now she wanna holla cause they playing my tunes
Kee hai tere raadhe
Sabh sun le, oh na phir aave
Je mere barre suneyah tor phir kee eh
Is vaqt mein tenu meri need eh

[Chorus]
They dont wanna put in work for the rari
But they wanna live the life like cardi
They out here looking for a pay cheque
Am i the only one tryna make sense (oh)
Slow down slow down
I ain't tryna pay your bills right now
I just wanna see you work right now
Spin it round right now
Drop it down right now
Slow down slow down
I ain't tryna pay your bills right now
I just wanna see you work right now
Spin it round right now
I ain't tryna pay your bills right now
I ain't tryna be the one right now
I ain’t Tryna play ur bills right now
She ain’t getting no L-L-Love from me
I ain’t Tryna be the one right now
I know she wanna get one on one with me
I ain’t Tryna play ur bills right now
She ain’t getting no L-L-Love from me
I ain’t Tryna be the one right now

[Verse 2]
She ain't getting no favours
Only really love you for the papers
She see me fly by in a rolly
Calling on my phone like they know me
Money on her mind she don't know play tho
Only for the night never stay though
She don't wanna chill at the condo
She be at the club tryna get low

[Chorus]
They dont wanna put in work for the rari
But they wanna live the life like cardi
They out here looking for a pay cheque
Am i the only one tryna make cents (oh)
Slow down slow down
I ain't tryna pay your bills right now
I just wanna see you work right now
Spin it round right now
Drop it down right now
Slow down slow down
I ain't tryna pay your bills right now
I just wanna see you work right now
Spin it round right now
I ain't tryna pay your bills right now
I ain't tryna be the one right now
I ain’t Tryna play ur bills right now
She ain’t getting no L-L-Love from me
I ain’t Tryna be the one right now
I know she wanna get one on one with me
I ain’t Tryna play ur bills right now
She ain’t getting no L-L-Love from me
I ain’t Tryna be the one right now

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna waste no time
I'm looking for the one, but the one ain't you
You ain't gotta make a sound
Only wanna holla cause they playing my tunes
S-sun di eh ganneh
Aake mill meinu show te thu aake
Je teinu changa lagda phir kee eh
Is vaqt mein tenu meri need eh

[Chorus]
They don't wanna put in work for the rari
But they wanna live the life like Cardi
They out here looking for a pay cheque
Am i the only one tryna make cents (oh)
Slow down slow down
I ain't tryna pay your bills right now
I just wanna see you work right now
Spin it round right now
Drop it down right now
Slow down slow down
I ain't tryna pay your bills right now
I just wanna see you work right now
Spin it round right now
I ain't tryna pay your bills right now
I ain't tryna be the one right now
I ain’t Tryna play ur bills right now
She ain’t getting no L-L-Love from me
I ain’t Tryna be the one right now
I know she wanna get one on one with me
I ain’t Tryna play ur bills right now
She ain’t getting no L-L-Love from me
I ain’t Tryna be the one right now
