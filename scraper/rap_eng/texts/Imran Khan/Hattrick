[Verse 1: Imran Khan]
Tenu dasseya si kayi kayi vaar
Kise da vi kari na ve ainvayi aitbaar
Un kab banke vi rehan awazaar
Karde ni check sadda ki karobaar
Chick teri kardi mainu swikaar
Aaja ve mere tu backyard
Pakandi ve Barbecue tikke kabab
Karde reverse ve I get the bar
Saddi te battery ho gayi ae charge
Munda The Hague da main incharge
Sadda ve different wakhra class
Apni company davaan main boss
Sadde ve bank ‘ch all currencies
Source of my income is all overseas
Saddi Balenciaga ve shirt
Mainu kyon vekhen jiven tu khalees

[Chorus : Imran Khan]
Too many wannabe is down on the block now
On the block now, down on the block now
Too many copycats down on the block now
On the block now, down on the block now

[Bridge: Yaygo Musalini]
My brolas be getting it straight out the trenches
We fly with paranahs you swimming with pigeons
Might pray to Allah cuz my guap is religious
I Valentino my lil toe in the kitchen
Look at the flick of the wrist watch me whip it
Lionel Messi the way that I kick it
I ain’t put none of my trust in these niggas
I ain’t put none my trust in these bitches
IK please tell me who these lil niggas
Choppa from Pakistan shit on you niggas
I keep it 100 won’t switch on my niggas
Don’t talk to young Yaygo if it’s not 8 figures
Tell that lil nigga to get out his feelings
I want a mazi and I want a milli
Cavalli my bitch up lil mami she killin'
She tell me that she don’t feel none of these niggas

[Chorus : Imran Khan]
Too too many wannabe is down on the block now
On the block now, down on the block now
Too many copycats down on the block now
On the block now, down on the block now

[Verse 2: Imran Khan]
Ni pawan main kali Versace di shades
So nazar na aave mainu na koi fake
I’m dealing with two faces everyday
Ni puri ve industry kardi Betray
Mera te style unique te illegal
How do you like my Punjabi bilingual
Ve kariye ve debut without the casino
Lord of Rings da ve lage tu Sméagol
Chala vi ae Lambors, te Bentley, Bugatti
Ehna de creative de levels ne khali
Honja ve Ferange jiven Tsunami
Deposit the page cameron bugami
Ni jaaven Paris, Miami, Karachi
Let meet the fans in the Shopping Heavy
Main hu original your are a copy
Call me da brand new General Gaddafi

[Chorus : Imran Khan]
Too too many wannabe is down on the block now
On the block now, down on the block now
Too many copycats down on the block now
On the block now, down on the block now
