[Hook: Chinx]
I ride on them pussies, I’m talking Ducatti
I be with them niggas that jack and do robberies
Keep fucking around you gon make this a homi
I be with them niggas that jack and do robberies
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies
Pussiess talking all that shit, can’t hear nobody
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch nobody
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch nobody

[Verse 1: Chinx]
Since I got the rock I been hard in the paint
I be with them killers, them niggas that target your face
Post on the block and them pistols is loaded
Ducking them cops, shaking them rodents
We started from that floor up
You talking money then show some
When I rose up, my dough’s up like yay
When it’s war time then them niggas gon miss you
Been a long time, now the money ain’t an issue
Court side seat, nigga brought his own whistle
Pushing that rock, running the floor
Killing em, that was my aim from the door
Most of my niggas they ducking parole
We keep it quiet, you making it show
These niggas wired, I don’t want to talk
Them niggas lying, they ain’t got no dope
They be complying, they side with the law
Stand with iron, I ride with the four

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
My niggas gon' break that, head tops
Everybody catching headshots when we bend blocks
Fuck around and get your friend popped when we send shots
Do you really want to test hot, I’m a ten top
Imma hit you with a chest shot till your vest pop
Hit you with the best Glock in your tank top
Shots falling like a rain drop in the same spot
Everybody want to bang hot till the gang hot
Bodies
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies
Monte with me got about four bodies
Mitch is with me got about six bodies
Jaja with me got about two bodies
Me I got about twelve or ten bodies
Or ten bodies
Bodies

[Verse 3: Rowdy Rebel]
(Bow) Pull a car in that pussy then pop out
Hop out, the youngin' blow his top out
We drop out when my nigga pull that Glock out
When the Tommy get close you can’t dropout
Drop a dime on my nigga, I’ll block out
Put them bands on your head and your man’s gonna be dead
Cause none of my niggas can’t top out
I roll with them niggas that ride for me
Shoot at a nigga and die for me
Homie take over your property
And all of my niggas so proud of me
And all of my niggas still different, there’s levels to shit
And I know that I’m shitting
Plus there’s money they're getting
You fuck with their money, they load up that Smith and (Blaow!)
