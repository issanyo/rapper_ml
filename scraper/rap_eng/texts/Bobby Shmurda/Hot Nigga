[Intro]
Y'all tryna make a next motherfuckin' scene up in here, huh?
It's fucking Shmurda she wrote
How much shmoneys that?
Ah ah ahh, ah, ah, ahh, ah, ahh
Jahlil Beats, holla at me

[Verse]
I'm Chewy, I'm some hot nigga
Like I talk to Shyste when I shot niggas
Like you seen him twirl, then he drop, nigga
And we keep them 9 millis on my block, nigga
And Monte keep it on him, he done dropped niggas
And Trigger, he be wildin', he some hot nigga
Tones known to get busy with them Glocks, nigga
Try to run down and you can catch a shot, nigga
Runnin' through these checks 'til I pass out
And shorty give me neck 'til I pass out
I swear to God, all I do is cash out
And if you ain't a ho, get up out my trap house!
I been sellin' crack since like the fifth grade
Really never made no difference what the shit made
Jaja taught me flip them packs and how to maintain
Get that money back and spend it on the same thang
Shawty like the way that I ball out
I be gettin' money 'til I fall out
You talkin' cash, dog, I goes all out
Shorty love the way that I floss out
Free Greezy though, let all of my dogs out
Mama said no pussycats inside my doghouse
That's what got my daddy locked up in the dog pound
Free Phantom though, let all of my dogs out
We gon' pull up in that hooptie, like we cops on 'em
With them 16's, we gon' put some shots on 'em
I send a lil thot to send the drop on him
She gon' call me up and I'ma sick the hots on him
Grimey savage, that's what we are
Grimey shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my gun squad
And, bitch, if it's a problem we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin' out the AR
I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Rod
Broad daylight and we gon' let them thangs bark
Tell them niggas free Meeshie, ho
SUBwave, free Breezy, ho
And tell my niggas, Shmurda teamin', ho
Mitch caught a body about a week ago
Fuck with us and then we tweakin', ho
Run up on that nigga, get to squeezin', ho
Everybody catchin' bullet holes
Niggas got me on my bully, yo
I'ma run up, put that gun on him
I'ma run up, go dumb on him
Niggas got me on that young shit
Got me on that go-dumb shit

[Outro]
Got me on that go-dumb shit, man
Trap mode in this motherfucker
Hotter than a bitch
Ayo, pour up! I need some more drank
