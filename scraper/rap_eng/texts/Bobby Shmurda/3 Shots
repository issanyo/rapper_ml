[Verse 1: Bobby Shmurda]
Give a fuck about you bum niggas, dumb niggas
Let me tell you 'bout my young niggas, run niggas
About their hood, about their slums, nigga, what nigga?
Have you ever seen a pump, nigga? Drum, nigga?
I've been rolling with some gun spitters, gun niggas
And we be shootin' 'til they come get us, fuck niggas
And we be strapped and they ain't tell, nigga, hush nigga
Don't you ask me 'bout my cuz niggas or my blood niggas
They be with me cause of love, nigga
So don't you tell me what it should be or what your hood be
I'ma tell you how it could be and what it would be
If a nigga try to touch me then I'ma bust three
Like BLAOW, BLAOW, BLAOW

[Hook: Bobby Shmurda and Chinx]
Hit a nigga in his head top and watch a dread drop
I'ma put him on the red dot before I send shots
Tell my nigga ain't no leg shots before we bend blocks
Like BLAOW, BLAOW, BLAOW
Hit a nigga in his head top and watch a dread drop
I'ma put him on the red dot before I send shots
Tell my nigga ain't no leg shots before we bend blocks
Like BLAOW, BLAOW, BLAOW
When we come up in the buildin', pussy niggas head out
Every time we come around, know we bring the feds out
We ain't tryna take no legs out, we want them head shots
Like BLAOW

[Verse 2: Rowdy Rebel]
Nigga 7:45 done parked out of his house
Gun in his mouth, my little mans run in his house
Soon as the shotty snatch his body, grab the bricks and we out
Then switch the plates for the jakes, so they won't figure it out
And I'm like what, nigga? Fuck niggas
I'm genuine and I tote guns, nigga, guns, nigga
Give a fuck where you're from, nigga
You'll find your mommy in the trunk, nigga, slumped, nigga
And find your brother in that Dunns River
Whoever holdin' on that money better bring that bread out
Every time we in the buildin', boy we bring the feds out
We ain't aimin' for your legs, boy we want that headshot
Like BLAOW, BLAOW, BLAOW

[Hook: Bobby Shmurda and Chinx]
Hit a nigga in his head top and watch a dread drop
I'ma put him on the red dot before I send shots
Tell my nigga ain't no leg shots before we bend blocks
Like BLAOW, BLAOW, BLAOW
When we come up in the buildin', pussy niggas head out
Every time we come around, know we bring the feds out
We ain't tryna take no legs out, we want them head shots
Like BLAOW

[Verse 3: Hood Heffna]
It's consequences for your actions and words
That fake shit only attractive at first
3 shots in his head left his back on the curve
And you know I'm in these streets like the cracks in the curve
Fuck all these broke niggas, roach niggas
Sure I miss all of my cros niggas, close niggas (Free my hots)
And Bobby told me go nigga, blow nigga
So don't make me expose niggas and show niggas
Cause if anything you owe nigga
And you don't want me involve
I say I want ya head and my niggas'll cut it off
Fuck is yall, bullets'll touch em all
Ya soldiers like shoulders nigga brush em off
