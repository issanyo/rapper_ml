[Hook]
All I wanted was a bank roll
So I went and got one
I don’t know what these niggas wanna hate for
I guess more money more problems
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll, bank roll

[Verse 1: Rico Love]
It was all a dream, I used to read word on magazine
Niggas used to smoke, but now it's lean
Niggas used to dance in the club
Now they’re standing on the tables and scream
I bought a hundred bottles one time
I ain’t even drink shit
Champagne for the dimes, guess we got something in common
We both like pink shit
Diamond chain, white mink shit
80 thousand Cuban link shit
Made a mill off, they don’t know
From telling these hoes that lose lips might sink ships
Spent the weekend abroad with a broad
Her best friend, she brought friends, we’re abroad
Saved her name in my phone as Dior
And my dick get hard when Dior call
Might see me spinning off with a bad bitch
Screaming out one of Puff's adlibs
Take that, take that

[Hook]
Turn the lights on
All I wanted was a bank roll (bank, bank)
So I went and got one
I don’t know what these niggas wanna hate for
I guess more money more problems
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll, bank roll

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
Pass that shit, nigga
Young nigga, I’ll be flipping that
So much different tracks, made a hundred for triple that with my nigga black
Goon sticks, I gotta stick with that, I gotta live with that
After screaming, free my nigga Champ
Get my nigga back
Lil my niggas, where my niggas at
Fresh money, we know how to act
Bitch, I’m hungry, where my dinner at?
Before I put a bullet in it, in your fitted cap
On the block, we was selling hard, we was never soft
Any niggas trying to get it off, we gonna get involved
If there’s drama what is hitting for, we gonna hit them off
Bang your block, then I let it off, then I'm speeding off
On the cops with a fancy car
Check my watch, it's an Audemar
Bitch, I ball like it’s no tomorrow
And my bitch, she like 44
But she a bad bitch and every time a nigga smash it
She got me screaming Diddy adlibs
(Take that, take that)

[Hook]
Turn the lights on
All I wanted was a bank roll (bank, bank)
So I went and got one
I don’t know what these niggas wanna hate for
I guess more money more problems
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
I’m just a young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll
Young nigga with a bank roll, bank roll

[Bridge: Rico Love]
She say, “oh, Rico, I love you so”
What you’re doing, I’ll never know
Maybe cause you had a soul
So fucking incredible, incredible
Father, forgive me for I’ve sinned
Father, forgive me for I’ve sinned
All I wanted was a bank roll
Father, forgive me for I've sinned

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
All I wanted was a bank roll
A hundred thousand dollars worth a bank roll
And I don’t need to smoke, but my niggas do
I just need a couple old schools, I can paint in gold
Driveway looking like the Grammies
My bae looking for her panties
Nowadays niggas buying stock
But back in my days everybody wanted candy
Spend us on a dropped top
Stopped at the light, but they still move
Head broke off, so far to the left
When the wave move on, they gonna fuck around and kill you
Now I got her phantom rose
But back then I couldn’t get her ... jaws
Got rich before I got famous
Sit naughty on my dick, like my dick got the antidote
It’s a gift just to see the light
Most niggas can’t handle those
My bitch had mosquito bites
Got rich, and I switched her for cantaloupes
Fuck living average
A nigga trying to live lavish
And every time I spend a million bucks
I stand up in my truck and I scream to these hot lips

Take that, take that
Turn the lights on
