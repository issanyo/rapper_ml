[Hook: Bobby Shmurda]
Brains on the wall, brains on the floor
He ain't even make it past the kitchen door
Nah me and fuck niggas, we don't get along
Nah me and fuck niggas, we don't get along
Brains on the wall, brains on the floor
He ain't even make it past the kitchen door
Me and fuck niggas, we don't get along
Nah me and fuck niggas, we don't get along

[Verse: Fetty Luciano]
Gang is out broad daylight, sales bangin' out
Gang is out, you don't come outside 'less your gang is out
With and 40 Glock, and some steak and loud
You don't come outside 'less your gang is out
Bitch the gang is out
Free Rasha, let my Haitians out
Glock with a 30, bitch the laser's out
It's amazing now, I went the paper route
Brains on wall, brains on a wall
If they outside, we gon hit em all
Brains on the wall, brains on the wall
On the kitchen floor, bitch let's go to war

[Hook: Bobby Shmurda]
Brains on the wall, brains on the floor
He ain't even make it past the kitchen door
Nah me and fuck niggas, we don't get along
Nah me and fuck niggas, we don't get along
Brains on the wall, brains on the floor
He ain't even make it past the kitchen door
Me and fuck niggas, we don't get along
Nah me and fuck niggas, we don't get along

[Verse: Bobby Shmurda]
Difference is, I'm still with the shits, you ain't with the shits
Listen bitch, I been rippin' beats, since like 96
Listen bitch, I be on I-5th, with like 90 clips
3 rolls, got a 30 shot, that's a 90 clip
They call the cops, I call my HOTS
We got the drop, we spinnin' blocks
We outta time, I need my watch
But that Rollie don't tick-tock
I want it yall, he going out, call the coroner
We [?] at your mans [?] pick your homie up
Off the scene, pull your mask off, pull his skully up
Everywhere I go, bitch we toolied up

[Hook: Bobby Shmurda]
Brains on the wall, brains on the floor
He ain't even make it past the kitchen door
Nah me and fuck niggas, we don't get along
Nah me and fuck niggas, we don't get along
Brains on the wall, brains on the floor
He ain't even make it past the kitchen door
Me and fuck niggas, we don't get along
Nah me and fuck niggas, we don't get along
