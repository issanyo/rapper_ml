[Hook: Richie P]
Hit the club, hit the clock with a hundred models
Rest in peace, to Kane I bought a hundred bottles
Niggas know I'm in the hood, I keep that strap tight
Tell them pussy niggas chill they better act right
Act right, act right
Tell them pussy niggas chill they better act right
Act right, she could get that act right
I'll run up on a fuck they better act right

[Verse 1: Richie P]
I'm going going, back back, to the 9-0
Hit a fuck and watch him die slow
Cheech &Chong on that diesel, got his eyes low
My nigga Kane gone, what they think I'm riding for
Guns on the waist, put them guns in your face
TP3 is on the way, sorry for the wait
What these niggas talkin' bout? I ain't tryna hear it
Shoot the soul out of niggas tryna see a spirit
Then I run for a nigga with the mask on
Young Shmoney in the building and his cash long
Balenciaga and Versace, turn my swag on
Tell them bitches, we ain't worried cause we past them
Street educated so you know we past dumb
Hit the trap, just relax 'til the cash come
My nigga Chewy Chewy let them shells fly
I tell 'em free all of my niggas out them cell blocks

[Hook: Richie P]
Hit the club, hit the clock with a hundred models
Rest in peace, to Kane I bought a hundred bottles
Niggas know I'm in the hood, I keep that strap tight
Tell them pussy niggas chill they better act right
Act right, act right
Tell them pussy niggas chill they better act right
Act right, she could get that act right
I'll run up a fuck they better act right

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
You better act right, I got a fat pipe
Bitch it's trap time, know i got that sack, right?
A-Rod in my trap with a black nine
If a nigga play get that ass lined
That hot shit, we pop shit (we drop shit)
Gun Squad shut down your whole block bitch
It's that hot shit, get you pop bitch (got bitch)
Gun Squad shut down your whole block bitch
What it is bitch, clean and rich bitch
Smoke dope, I'm about to get lifted
I'ma Shmurda dat, I'ma Shmurda this
And I'ma Shmurda that bitch, I'ma Shmurda this
We potent, we rollin'
Catch a fuck nigga, we gon' bust him open
(I'm going going back back to the fifties)
Smoke a nigga like I'm Fifty

[Hook: Richie P]
Hit the club, hit the clock with a hundred models
Rest in peace, for Kane I bought a hundred bottles
Niggas know I'm in the hood, I keep that strap tucked
Tell them pussy niggas shit they better act right
Act right, act right
Tell them pussy niggas shit they better act right
Act right, shit can get that act right
I'll run up on em', fucking better act right

[Outro: Richie P]
I'm going going, back back, to the 9-0
Hit a fuck and watch him die slow
I'm going going, back back, to the 9-0
Hit a fuck and watch him die slow
Hit a fuck and watch him die slow
Hit a fuck and watch him die slow
Hit a fuck and watch him die slow
Bitch, I'm going back to the 9-0
