[Intro: Bobby Shmurda]
(Girl, he got shmoney)
Bobby bitch, make that body flip
You know I don't know karate, bitch
We droppin' bodies, bitch
They say shootin' is my hobby, bitch
And I'm a problem, kid
Slide up on him with revolvers
I ain't with that arguing

[Verse 1: Bobby Shmurda & **Rowdy Rebel**]
You don't know they call me Bobby bitch, oh yeah...
I'm that Rowdy, let's go get a nigga
**Pull up on that block and get to switching niggas**
Hollow tips, extended clip a nigga
Cuz GS9, we some different niggas
And free my broadies out of prison nigga
**I would say all their names, but that's a lesson niggas**
Another day, another mission nigga
**A Tom Cruise just caught another victim nigga
30 on my clip and then my Nina stuffed in curry
If I roll with my gun squad tell 5' 0 mention my shit curry
And we get it right there, right there, we get it right there, going up that .30
I told him get it right, get it right, better get it right, didn't knew you dirty
We savage (?)
My niggas, they locked up
Now all types of problem
Nigga, that's a no no
Cuz I let Bobby go go
I let Monte go go
And I tell Jodye go go
And shouts out that 44
I'm with Shmoney gutta
Look at my recliner
He say he got two freestyles like me and my lil lingo
Ask them if they ready
Take 'em to the telly
I'm a big belly road boy, that's around my belly**

[Hook: Bobby Shmurda]
Bobby bitch

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Young rich nigga walking with shmoney
Fuck 12, got a AK on me
They tell 'em like yo little chain, look at my chain, my niggas like double in chain dang
I was 9, I was walking with the 9
They found them bodies bitch
Maserati coupe with a thottie bitch
Free GS9, free Bobby bitch
My bitch, she all about shmoney
Regulars ain't talking no money
Still working but I'm already rich
Why that ho keep looking at wrist?
She just wanna fuck cuz I'm famous
Don't fuck with the people in the kitchen, no cases
They see me, I'm changing locations
Young nigga, I trap out of Vegas

[Bridge: Bobby Shmurda]
Bobby bitch, make that body flip
You know I don't know karate, bitch
We droppin' bodies, bitch
They say shootin' is my hobby, bitch
And I'm a problem, kid
Slide up on him with revolvers
I ain't with that arguing
You don't know they call me Bobby bitch

[Hook]
