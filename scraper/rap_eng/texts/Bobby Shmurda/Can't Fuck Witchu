[Verse 2:DBoy]
I'm with Bobby, shooting shit up is my hobby
Catch a fuck up in his lobby
Bet the gun handle the problem
I'm with Monte in the cut, with 16s we light shit up
I'm with Rebel on the strip, I hit niggas then we dip
Bitch i'm hot, bitch i'm crip, Slice Billy with the shits
I don't fuck witchu' no more cause GS9 is how I live
And my niggas with the shits, and everybody know all my niggas up them poles, and everybody know
I call Bobby, he go savage, everybody catching holes
I call Rebel , he go crazy, everybody gotta go

[Verse 3:Rowdy Rebel]
But wait, what they know bout' Rowdy?
They don't know bout' Rowdy
That's another sh-man down, tell them come get the body
GS9 my posse, we can't kick it, sorry
Im with shmoney Bobby, call up my shmurda posse
That boy shmurda Bobby move like shower posse
Bullets flying through ya club, that's a shower party
