Then she asked me if I'm alright ain't sleep in 4 nights
In that pussy I'm a slow grind in it all night
I'ma hit that pussy 4 times then 1 more time
Then tell my baby that its go time I got to go grind
I'm with Foolie in that low ride we ball like 4 9's
Run up on me, I'ma blow mines, hit you 4 times, then 1 more time
Now you can tell I'm a trap boy

Tell that Sergeant and that motherfuckin' Cap', boy
Now they mad a nigga made it out the trap boy

Runnin from cops, I know that they watch and I know that you hate
Niggas better check in when they hit my state
Foolie Tha Prince, I call up Bobby when I'm in New York
As long as I'm trappin I'm keepin a torch
Shoot up yo block if I hop out the Porsche
Long stick with a long clip, got a bad bitch I give her long Dick
Posted up on Wall Street, leave em on the wall if a nigga trip
I got money now so I'm Shmoney Dancin
They used to look up at me like I wouldn't make it
