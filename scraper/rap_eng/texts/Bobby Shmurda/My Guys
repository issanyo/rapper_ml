[Intro: Rowdy Rebel]
Bah Bah, Bah
We ain't let up for nothing nigga
We sending shots to everybody
Bah
Niggas know our name
Niggas know our game
Niggas know our block
Just pull up
(ROWDY BABYY)

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
I tell OP watch that nigga
He say copy
In the flossy riding shotty with no shotties
Just a Glock that got a body
If the cops pull us over
I know that's gon' be a homi
Cuz I ain't trynna go to jail
Not for you, not nobody
On the 9, wit 2 9s
It's a stickup all the time
Bitch go get up on your grind
1090 GS9
Send shots, bottom line
Another day, another mission
Ain't no day we don't go ride
Ain't no shooting on our side
It's a body all the time
So the cops is tryna find
Another nigga out his mind
And I bet he from the 9
Or the floss
Where they floss
With a glizzy by they side
From the city where they ride
1090 those my guys
(Nigga those my guys)

[Chorus: Bobby Shmurda]
I'm screaming nigga those my guys
I'm screaming nigga those my guys
They screamin’ nigga we gon ride?
They screamin we gon ride
They screaming nigga we gon ride, with a loaded 45
With a loaded 45’
They screaming nigga we gon ride
I'm smoking kushy till I die
I'm smoking kushy till I die
With a loaded 45’
I'm screamin nigga we gon ride

[Verse 2: OP]
I call up Rowdy, call my hots
All my niggas spinning blocks
We got red beams
We got the thots
That we always totting Glocks
We in the kitchen, on a mission
All my Shmoneys go and get it
Ain't no snitching
Ain't no bitching
Call my shmurdas, get tha clipping
Yeah you know OP is different
I'm from 80s, I send shots
Also don't fuck with 100 cops
Brodie bound to make it hot
Once he hear, "Ah, Ah, Ah"
We don’t fuck around with ops
You could catch me in that drop
18 karat on the teeth
A couple foreign on the feet
And don’t fuck around with me
A hollow tips is all you'll see
Shmoney team and shmurda team
Yeah my niggas all OP
1090, MBB
Yeah you know that is the team

[Chorus: Bobby Shmurda] x2
