Gang Gang
Yo Bobby what up
Ain't shit nigga
You know we run shit nigga
Cod
Shmurda what up

(Chorus)
Look bitch i'm a savage
Really gettin' money all these other niggas actin'
Jump on the dick do a split do gymnastics
Hit 'em with a pump n make a nigga do a backflip

Look bitch i be trappin'
Higher than a bitch, i be higher than Aladdin
Call me on my phone ,i'ma probably say i'm trappin'
Before we get an o??, we can probably shit crackin'
Oops i gotta go, i'm right back to trappin'
Monte in the field you know that boy is bout that action
He call me on my phone and tell everything that happened
I'ma call Up-Top, and he gon' act a savage
Skirt up on a motha fucka,  pull up on a ratchet
Skirt up on a motha fucka, we gon' pull on 'em blastin'
Nigga watch what you say, Jordan got the ratchet
And last nigga said something wrong nice casket
Niggas tryna fight, but i don't know karate
Bitch my name is Bobby have me shooting at your lobby
Niggas tryna fight, but i don't know karate
Bitch my name is Bobby have me shooting at your motha fuckin' lobby
Bitch i'm Bobby

(Chorus)

Trap clown, back down, all these niggas wanna rap now
Big guns and get back down, try to run from these mac rounds
Tell them niggas we back now
Shelf life they act out
Im outchere with it this money im gettin' all came from the trap house
Movie shit we actors niggas, no script just real life
Hit the club with like 20 racks bet you don't know what that feels like
You broke nigga just face it, you fuck niggas keep hatin'
We won nigga stop racin' plus my record clean with no case
True religion n nudies??? Yea you know that im goin' fly
Dope weed that's all we smoke, roll it up we get more high
Stay strapped with a .45, in case a nigga wan' test me
I'm always good for that 2 piece but i'ma knock him out with this lefty
I'ma knock him out like lefty
Got a lot of work and it's hefty
Told these niggas they can ride the wave and they don't need no jetski
All i know is i'm ballin', swish nigga like Spalding
Yeah i'm on the bullshit and i ain't talkin' bout jordan

(Chorus)

Look hoe i be dwaggin'
Bitches say wassup; ain't shit paper stacking
Chillin in the trap doin' numbers i ain't braggin'
Try n rush the spot n the pistols we be blasting
Look hoe i ain't average
I'm on GS9 so you know i'm with the static
Rollin' on yo block , got the hollows spittin' rapid
Jordan with the shits he don't miss shit get tragic
Shoot a nigga in his casket
I don't give a fuck in front of his moms ill let him have it
Call my killas up have my niggas up in traffic
Cal my shooters up you know my niggas act a savage

(Chorus)

Trap Trap...Trap on.. Trap Trap...
