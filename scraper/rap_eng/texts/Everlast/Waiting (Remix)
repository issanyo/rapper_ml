[Intro: Madonna]
Waiting for you, just waiting
What you waiting for?
Waiting for you, just waiting
What you waiting for?
Waiting for you, just waiting
What you waiting for?
Waiting for you, just waiting
What you waiting for?

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Well I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe that in their moment of need
That they want what you want, but they don't

[Pre-Chorus 1: Madonna]
Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry, you're gonna say goodbye
Baby tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify

[Chorus: Madonna]
This waiting for you, just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you, just waiting
What you waiting for?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings
Like you are now, what happened, what do I remind you of?
Your past, your dreams, or some part of yourself that you just can't love
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Madonna]
Life has taught me that love, with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here, like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

[Verse 3: Everlast]
What you waitin' for, hun, come and get it
Don't even sweat it baby doll that can wet it
I treat it like a virgin and work it over time
If honey's lookin' fine we can go the whole night
We can do the deuce sweety pie, what's the news
I bet ya when I'm done, hun, I know I'm true blue
Cause I can get explicit, baby let me kiss it
Get it while it's hot cause when I'm gone you're gonna miss it
Sexual healin' baby that's what I'm dealin'
Mirrors on the ceilin', come check the feelin'
High pitch squealin', twitch it, jerk it
I'm a stud like Captain Kirk and it's your body that I'm workin'
Cause I can get freaky like a Friday
I know you're going my way, naked on the highway
Jump into the ride, I'll take you to the pent
The name's Everlast, hun, here's what it is

[Chorus: Madonna]
Waiting for you, just waiting
I'm waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

[Bridge: Madonna]
Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

[Outro: Madonna]
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
And the next time you want pussy, ha, just look in the mirror, baby
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
