[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Comptown Club
What a crowd, what a mob, what a show
We got Ice T in the house, we got Eazy-E in the house
And all the way from Philly we've got Schoolly D
But right now I'd like to introduce the star of the show, Tairrie B

[Tairrie B]
Now people here's a rhyme about Vinnie Tha' Moocha
He was a Brooklyn boy, hootiche kootcher
He came to LA and thought he was fly
But Tairrie B said: "Playa please, don't even try"

[hook: Cab Calloway]
Hi di hi di hi di hi (hi di hi di hi di hi)
Ho de ho de ho de ho (ho de ho de ho de ho)
He de he de he de he (he de he de he de he)
Ho de ho de ho de ho (ho de ho de ho de ho)

[Tairrie B]
OK, my story starts out at the smokey hole
You know the hip hop spot, well it's the place to go
T was in the corner cold coolin' with the posse
When this man said:
"Hey baby, sign this 8x10 glossy
Yo my name is Vinnie as the story goes
In the past three weeks, I've been to all of your shows
I've been hoping maybe me and you could spend a little time
Maybe get to know each other over a drink of wine
Sit down and talk, maybe take a long walk
Under the moonlight, holding hands thru the whole night"
Thanks for the compliment, but I know your game
I bet you say the same thing to every dame

[hook]

[Tairrie B]
Now for those of you who don't know, Vinnie's a Schmoozer
A good looking Joe, but a three time loser
He can look you in the eye and make ya lose your breath
In other words homegirls the boy was def
But T was no sucker, she couldn't be played
By a man out to get what he can, like get paid
He said: "I'll buy you a diamond, a five karat chunk"
Thanks but yo, I already got one chump
And if you wanna impress me stop playin' a part
I can tell a phony fella from the very start
But Vinnie wouldn't let up and T was gettin' fed up
Her bodyguard approached and said: "It's time for you to get up"
Then all of a sudden Vinnie pulled out a gun
And said: "Your coming with me doll, we're gonna get done"
And as he headed for the door as if you needed to ask
Well who should appear but her man Everlast

[hook]

(cuts)

[Tairrie B and Everlast]
Well Everlast said: "Drop the piece and let my girl go
Punk, Tairrie B's coming with me so
Leor get the door, Bronx Style get my back
Donald D get the gat, this is a syndicate jack"
But Vinnie was mad and had become a creep
And the boys had a bad reputation to keep
So he said: "Peep this"and then shot twice
Then Vinnie was dead, ya know, "On Ice"
And as she looked down on Vinnie she said: "You poor slob
Didn't I tell you I was down with the syndicate mob
"And we're notorious" so listen up y'all
That's whatcha get for messin' around with a gangster's maul

[hook]

[Outro]
I always thought Vinnie was a deadbeat
Well, it just goes to show ya
Anything can happen at the Comptown Club
What a crowd, what a mob, what a show
