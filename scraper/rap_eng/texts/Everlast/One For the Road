[Intro]
Huh!  Check it out!  Everybody in the house, check it out!
The House Of Pain is in full effect

[Everlast]
Call me the corn fed, peckerwood, redneck cracker
White bread, shit kickin' Irish beat jacker
Comin' with the style of a Celtic rebel
Those who ain't on my level call me the blue eyed devil
But that's just because they don't know what I know
And that's just because they can't flow like I flow
I rip shit, dip shit, so what you gotta say
Why you wanna play, I fuck you up with no delay
And knock your motherfuckin' fronts out
Smoke my philly blunts out, my buddha never runs out
I turn the little stunts out
And I got the hookers callin' me pops
Once their cherry pops, Everlast gets all the props
I'm hittin' skins from here to Copenhagen
I bed their wenches cause you know I'm a pagan
The House Of Pain, that's the name of my crew
You don't like it, tough luck, what the fuck you gonna do?
Nothin', you ain't sayin' nothin'
You need to start puffin' and relax
Or you'll wind up gettin' taxed
For your money, for your jewels, for your car, for your ho
My crew, they start trippin' while I'm rippin' up the show

[Chorus]
Mickey Mouse, you know he's in the house
I said Mickey Mouse, you know he's in the house

[Everlast]
One for the road, this is one for the road
For my man Matt Champy, this is one for the road
Tura lura lura, tura lura li
Tura lura lura, that's an Irish lullaby
No need to act fly, you'll be sayin' nighty-night
The place you're in is right if you're lookin' for a fight
Step up, your blood, I spill it
Put on the beat, I kill it
I'll burn ya like some bacon that's been fryin' in my skillet
Move over Sizzlean, my favorite color's green
But I'll beat ya black and blue, cause I'm always with my crew

[Chorus]
Mickey Mouse, you know he's in the house
I said Mickey Mouse, you know he's in the house (x2)
