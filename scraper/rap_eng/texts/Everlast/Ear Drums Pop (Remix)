[Planet Asia]
Affiliation like, Dilated Peoples

"Watch your ear drums pop"
"Watch your ear drums pop, got this rap shit locked"

"Planet Asia, ain't a damn thing changed" [Planet Asia]

[Verse 1: Planet Asia]
The methods of melodic torture, mic mastery
I'm locally accepted, worldwide respected
So gimmie mines and meet your deathwish
Dead at the throat like floatin wit your neck slit
Be gone, I'm way beyond
My mind shines harder than your necklace
I just violate the streets until I Dilate the Peoples
Posse cut, kill the track, annihilate the sequel
Trigger-happy, anxious to earn a stripe
Like it was just put on
Initiation means death, burn the mic now meet your escort
If the shot's rusted, hot sauce for all you block busters
Duck it, you're fuckin wit the spot rushers
Bustin wit brand new artillery cocked
Straight out the metal shop, to catch you up close, dead on the spot
There goes your manhood
Mad Max, Terror your Dome for canned goods
Blaze you wit the heat, destroy my conscience
For the backward, easin up ain't in the plans
I leave MC's wit no stands
Ill conventions so deep in thoughts, the fans labeled it trance

"Iriscience ya'll" [Iriscience]
"MC Iriscience" [Iriscience]
"Rakaa you don't rhyme fair" [Iriscience]

[Verse 2: Rakaa]
Aiyyo we hit it festivals, and we hit it the nightclubs
We hit it like Brad Pitt did it to Fight Club
I love it and live it
If you want it, then come and get it
I'm like Show and AG, or Alomar how I spit it
It's the highly-developed, well-equipped intelligent
You're a target if you're soft, pastel, or delicate
I'm bold cuz everything goes at pro caliber
A top competitor, a worldclass traveller
Spell-the-name-right.com, check the site
Like they could check the date on a dime from satellites
I move like Coltrane, pushin a blue tray
Rakaa's my name, style Fatal like Hussein
Wit Planet Asia, Defari, and Everlast
Phil Tha Ag and Ev deliever the weather fast
Joey Chavez, and a butcher named Babs
Dilated, now take that shit back to the lab

"Man listen" [Defari]
"From L.A. and it's finest" [Iriscience]
"Defari" [Defari]

[Verse 3: Defari]
They wanna jack who?
Step up and I'll dump
Invade and face the rage of a twelve gauge pump
Yo chump, I'm not that guy, my name's Defari
I roll wit the fo' sho' logo, the open eye
Dilated, heavy rotated, Golden Stated
So many dream of the sound that me and Ev created
Everybody wanna be rhymin wit two left feet
That's like a cripple man in lane five at the track meet
You wishin on a star but you lookin at the sun
I be the one who takes it so serious, it's more than fun
Pro sport wit a bottle of Crown and quart of Guiness
The ink fill up the paper in a matter of minutes
Whether from Brooklyn or Venice
I travel wit mental fitness
Takin out you suckers and you don't know how I did this
So quit it, quit wit the nonsense, you harmless
Leave the hip hop alone and get your fix from a pharmacy

"Everlastin fresh" [Defari]
"Whitey Ford brings the devastating mic control" [Everlast]

[Verse 4: Everlast]
I read the New Testament and gave it up for Lent
All the places I went just to pay my rent
Used to keep me bent, on a ritual daily
Cock my hammer, spit a comet like Halley
I'll buck a .380 on ones that act Shady
I'm original like Grady, check my Sanford, Son
You know you ain't the one that rep peckerwood status
I'll bust that ass, keep your eyes on the floor
What you comin here for, son you know the law
Let's take it back to the house, slide off your blouse
Lift up your skirt and expose your panties
For the world to see, you can't rep it like me
I'm Communist, terrorist, vandalist
Catalyst, scandalous, masacous, never miss battalist
You must be crazy, or just plain dumb
You might catch a beatdown now where I come from
It's like that

"Crescent Heights, get the name right" [Phil]
"You know my mothafuckin name" [Phil]

[Verse 5: Phil Tha Agony]
Phil Tha Agony, a superhero
Creatin miracles, Analyze This like Robert DeNiro
Wit your air-tight vaccuum lungs
Got your stupid ass strung on the hung, chewin gum, bitin your tongue
Bleedin, what is it that you're really needin
Is it fresh air to breathin, a bank account so plenty of cheese in
Take into consideration, wit every situation that you're facin
Analyze the operation
What's the function? Who does the label work, who does the paper work?
Who's the president behind the desk, reclinin the best
Too many fake fraudulent artist, ignoramusus
Gettin famous-es, tryin to steal my whole name in this
That's why every move is documented
It's the unprescedented, rhymes that I invented
R-rated, Phil Tha Agony and Dilated
Crescent Heights, we're stealin your height, violated

"'76 born bomb lyricist" [Evidence]
"Evidence...got another sound mission" [Defari]

[Verse 6: Evidence]
Yo ya'll, my shit is timeless
A clock wit no hands, a hourglass wit no sand
My lifespan's been written before anyone cloths or ribbon
I've started their path, but what I've said just passed
The labcat's back, that's why I feel like I've been chose
To rise to occasions wit hits like Pete Rose
Speak to myself, but once I say when
No mistakes allowed, sketch my letters in pen
Permanent ink, unleaded gas tank ready to drink
Open all flows in perfect border insync
Total chaos, mass confusin
Just entered the playoffs, yo my team's not losin

"Platform, ultimate" *repeat to end*
