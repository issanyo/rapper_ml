Sitting restless under the moonlight
I know I'm getting ready to kill
They say we're going in with the daylight
I don't want to but I will

Cause I won't know the man that kills me
And I don't know these man I kill
I pray to God for my salvation
Wash away the blood I spill

I try not to think about my family
Cause it's a little too much take
Now here I got me and I got my buddy
Who can't afford even one mistake
I'm sorry about writing on dirty cardboard
It's the only paper I can find
Tell everyone I got their letters
Tell everyone I'm doing fine

Late at night when I can dream I
I think about life back in the world
I miss you and Dad
I miss sister Sarah
I Miss my wife and baby girl
Pray for me pray for my soul ma
Pray for me and all my sins
They say I got a job to do now
And I'll be back when it finally ends

Do you think I should be fighting?
Mom are you proud are you ashamed
I really am trying to do the right thing
I hope my government can say the same

Cause I won't know the man that kills me
And I don't know these man that I kill
Cause not one of us doing god's will
