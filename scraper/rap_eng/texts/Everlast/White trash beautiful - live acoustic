White Trash Beautiful, Trailer Park Queen
She slings hash at the diner from 11 to 5
She married a boy from school, thought he was oh so cool
But all he can do for money is drive
Out late haulin' freight on Interstate 5, prayin' he'll see home before his baby arrive

White Trash Beautiful, There's something you should know
My heart belongs to you
I know you coulda found a better guy
I'll love you till the day I die
I swear to God it's true
I'm comin' home to you
I'm comin' home to you girl

He lights a cigarette, his eyes half open
He won't be home tonight, but she keeps hopin'
Drinkin himself to sleep is his only way of copin'
She waits for him every night, she leaves the front door open
It's 4 AM and doin' 95, Tryin to stay awake and make it home alive

White Trash Beautiful, There's something you should know
My heart belongs to you
I know you coulda found a better guy
I'll love you till the day I die
I swear to God it's true
I'm comin' home to you
I'm comin' home to you girl

Her lip stick's painted red, her nametag's crooked
Her heart's been gone awhile with the truck driving man that took it
He keeps her photograph on his rearview mirror
She prays for him every night, she hopes that he can hear her

White Trash Beautiful, There's something you should know
My heart belongs to you girl
I know you coulda found yourself a better guy
I'll love you till the day I die
I swear to God it's true
I'm comin' home to you
I'm comin' home to you girl
I'm comin' home to you
