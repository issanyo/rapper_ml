All my money's spent
All my prayers been said
Walking up that hill
Legs are nearly dead
It won't be long at all

Heartbeats tick away
Feel it in my bones
Will I see the day
Pay off all these loans?
It won't be long at all
It won't be long at all

Long and winding roads
I walked 'em all in vain
When that trumpet blows
Hope they call my name
Won't be long at all

Put your rifles down
Abandon all your arms
Sing your prayers out loud
The Gospel's in your song
'Cause it won't be long at all
No it won't be long at all
It won't be long at all

Stop your warring way
Only kill your bros
Put your season skies
Kindness to your mom
It won't be long at all
It won't be long at all

Teach your children well
Beg them to be kind
'Cause they'll be running shit
When you're old, deaf, dumb and blind
And it won't be long at all
No, it won't be long at all
It won't be long at all
It won't be long at all
