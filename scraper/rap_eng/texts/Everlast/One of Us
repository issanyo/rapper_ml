[Verse 1]
A diamond in a rough
A walk out in a rain
It's never been enough
Addicted to the pain
Why so serious?
Searching for blame
Less than obvious
A broken picture frame

[Chorus]
It's a God damn mess, to cry in shame
All but one of us lose the game
It's the natural things that stay the same
All but one of us lose the game
All but one of us

[Verse 2]
Like a spider's web
Waiting for a fly
Something soft and sweet
It catch my ruined eye
Drink from sunken tea
Drunk and oh, so high
Joy turns into tree
Plants they grow arrive

[Chorus]
It's a God damn mess, to cry in shame
All but one of us lose the game
It's the natural things that stay the same
All but one of us lose the game
All but one of us

[Verse 3]
Beneath the joy and pain
Amongst the fear and pride
A minor victories
Thoughts of suicide
Faith in God and there
The universe provides
Gripped us with this ends
Take you for a ride

[Chorus]
It's a God damn mess, to cry in shame
All but one of us lose the game
It's the natural things that stay the same
All but one of us lose the game
All but one of us
All but one of us lose the game
All but one of us
All but one of us lose the game
