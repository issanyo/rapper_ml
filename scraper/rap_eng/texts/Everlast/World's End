[Verse 1:Sick Jacken]
Yeah !
Divine put the needle on plates and rock vinyl
Dusty finger diggin' the crates and puff rhino
Whiskey breath tatted on flesh >????????????<
Warporn outta ya deck is all I know
We shit on your idols cross-hairs finish your vitals
Eliminate all Rivals, homie this is survival
Crime-wave title dictate porn recital
Sick Psycho, Homicidal music my title
From that downtown Apocalypse
Rocking this with cartridges
Full clip, stray bullets, random who the target is
Bystander might stand in the way of the starving kids
Stay hungry that's how nigga's they killin' all of this
Ominous, not communist, the key to dominance
O.G., only way for me, I got some time in this
Mirror my society
The fueling and the violence, shit, is what I miss
And you hear clearly when I'm rhyming this

[Verse 2:Everlast]
Technical weaponry, rhyme style heavenly
Learn my pedigree, burn my effigy
Spit my therapy, smoke my remedy
Passive aggressively, choke my enemy
Invoke my revelry, provoke my cavalry
Bucket list trilogy, WarPorn Industry
Terminate assassinate with extreme bigotry
Heavyweight armor plate, subatomic energy
Necronomicon, triple hexagon
One level beyond the devil's word is bond
Put murder on a song and the burner in your palm
3rd grade death toll, underwater death row
Crocodile tearing, never loving God fearing
Bio engineering, stem cell cloning
Fillet with the bone in, international zoning
Seven samurai all die by one Ronin

[Verse 3:Divine Styler]
God ?hammer? merciless, sonic rock turbulence
Armor’s on, gun metal, matte black surfaces
Squad with the virtuous, charged for the murderous
Boss for the dark hearts lost in the urban grit
Torn from the flame of the Djinn do you acknowledge this
Profile of the new world is ominous
Broken equilibrium, Americana promises
Warporn risen from the ash of the bottomless
And watch the ?dystopian? drop from the Fallopian
Admire for the entire empire it’s draconian
Shit is nickelodeon, anime, pandemonium
Quickening the vibratory death of associates
This is Warporn banging that colloquium
Get your door blown off the hinge you quote to him
Blow my brains out remotely from the podium
Grey cerebellum, decorations of the holiest
Seven levels of heaven are ceremonious
Nine levels of hell are for the loneliest
Fabricated, modified, mass hypnosis
Floating hallucinations while I’m sitting in a lotus
