[Chorus: Everlast]
I think I would, if I could, kill the emperor
Let's stop the war and feed the poor, let's kill the emperor
Let's stop the lies, the dead can't rise, silence every mother's cries
I think I would, if I could, kill the emperor

[Verse 1: Unknown]
Yo, it's like resident evil
The emperor's people don't give a mad fuck about your life
They'll fuck your wife and your kids, they've got people doing bids
For being slaves to the dope that they supplying
Still they keep lying
And tell you that it's some cartel
While they waiting on the heaven they're creating the hell
And they rape the constitution while you wait in your cell
And to the victors go the spoils and that's
Oil wells
Call Orson Wells
'Cause the world's at war
And the front-line's just outside your front door
Fuck the New York Times, and fuck CNN
And politicians that pretend to be the working man's friend

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Unknown]
Yo, the emperor's a liar, the fields are on fire
Oil prices get higher, time's about to expire
Hurricane Katrina and Asian tsunamis
Adolescent mommies and high school snipers
Final days are coming, get ready for trial
Americans, they live in fifty states of denial
Have a coke and a smile or some crack in a vile
You can even buy a pill to keep you hard for a while
For these girls gone wild in this world at war
It's the same old whores, it's the new crusade
Yo, the plan been made, they lied to invade
I'm on the palace lawn with my live grenade
'Cause

[Chorus]
