(Ladies and gentlemen we have)
Everlast
(In the house tonight I think they got somethin they wanna say)

I'm here to uplift, I don't bug, I don't drift
Away from my subjects, not even if
My music stops or my beat is gone
I'm just here to express myself and pass it on

(So funky)

Speakin much words of wisdom, Everlast has the jism
So sit back, relax, kick up your feet and listen
To E cause that's me, no others can be
Half as fine, I blow your mind with an m-i-c
Get off the tip quick, boy, you're makin me sick
No other partner could be smarter than my man Kool Nick
Understand, he's my man with the plan
We come to parties with the posse just to gain some fans
The posse is strong, the lines are long
People flockin to my shows just to hear a song
Like this, it's not a diss, it's a mouthful of bliss
Throw your hands in the air and blow me a kiss
From the crowd cause I'm proud, I say my name loud
Everlast pounds sounds like a thundering cloud
It's not rock 'n roll, it's hip-hop music
It's got a lot of soul if you learn how to use it
Well, I'm here to tell suckers go to hell
Others tried to take me down but they're the ones who fell
Ignorance was their downfall
Take it a little at a time, don't go for it all
At once cause that's stupid, it don't make sense
Just relax and move your body, don't look so tense
I'm not here to diss nobody, I'm just havin some fun
Everlast last forever, that's why I'm number one
So pass it on

With a forty in my fist breakin out my list
Of all the suckers I'm cold about to diss
There's none to match me or even catch me
Off my guard, so that they can scratch me
Off the MC all-star team
Everlast is number one, that means I reign supreme
Cause there ain't no others, listen up brothers
Just because I'm white don't mean that I'm another
Sucker on the microphone frontin and fakin
Not Mexican, Asian, black or Jamaican
Just a sensation made to be caucasian
Get ready brothers, here comes an invasion
Don't try to stop it, you got a rhyme? Drop it
You might detect that respect's my topic
I won't rush it but I'll discuss it
Go ahead and pop your shot if you think that you can bust it
But I'ma go on, I'm gonna talk some more
I guarantee you won't be bored if you get on the floor
And go for yours and say that you get it

Get up, get out your seats, get on the floor and get with it
And listen to the rhyme I like to call mine
I re-rehearsed every verse and soon you will find
Not one mistake, so don't try to break
Or talk about takin out the dope rhymes I make
Just pass em on

You're goin wild for my flow and style
I don't stutter, I utter words versatile
I'm entertainin with my brain and always wearin a smile
I don't front, I don't fake, I run the whole mile
You clap cause my snap is like a crocodile
Whether I'm on stage or in my domicile
I'm not fiendin, I don't smoke, I tell you I'm no joke
You're schemin for my lyrics cause you know I did dope
Don't give me no Mo't, pour me a glass of rose
And I'll say 'skal' to your health and then I'll blow you away
Not Simple Simon on the ( ? ) just rhymin from Long Island
The rungs on the ladder of success I'm climbin
Fierce like a lion keepin ducks tame
Murderin two-bit MC's until none remain
Cold gettin dumb, I'm number one shinin like the sun
With a mic in my holster and I'm on the run
Gunnin down MC's and writin on the walls
I'm ready for a showdown if you got the balls
Commence, face my offense cause you're makin me tense
I make a lotta dollars but I make more sense
So pass it on

Pass it on, pass it down the line
I can throw with the best and go rhyme for rhyme
With any sucker claimin talent, thinkin that he got some
But what you do not realize is Everlast is number one
Cause Everlast is on a superior level
Go ahead and laugh, call me a devil
I won't care, yeah, my skin is fair
But I still go rhyme for rhyme anytime or -where
With you or any party or crew
And when I finished you're diminished, take a sip of my brew
And step off, clear my throat with a cough
And bust a move to show and prove that I'm hard not soft
And with my DJ Bilal my beat will be furnished
You find with my rhyme your mind will be nourished
With wisdom and knowledge, yeah, I went to college
And if you get dissed I won't apolog-
Ize, cause that's a part of my rise
And I go on and on, I go to any length
Just to show that when I throw my rhymes on the strength
I like to see the crowd movin when I come on
I'm just tryin to get my message across and pass it on
