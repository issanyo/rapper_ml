Everlast
What? You think it can't happen?
Soul Assassins 2000!
Word! Goes somethin' like this

On a vision quest fresh best error terror
Krush Groovin' like a low budget movie
I'm Wild Style like Lee Quinones
Stop ridin' on my cajones
I talk with a speak that's much unique
While you desperately seek for that Susie freak
Yo, word to Rob One. He used to like the big ladies
My name's Everlast, I started back in the 80s
Like (whoosh sound) all up your nostril
Actin' hostile, 13th apostle
Goin' postal, Holy Ghost know
Why you walkin' on a hostroll, actin' bicoastal
Bitch! Try to play the middle
Snitch wind up in the hospital
Cat on a hot tin roof with no fiddle
Put your money in the middle, get broke like coal

B-Real
Two deadly assassins makin' 'em fall
I'm Real
Everlast
I'm Everlast, and I'm takin' 'em all
B-Real
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Both
Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate

B-Real
I'll spit out the fire, you won't know what hit
Watch me place you out quicker than the joint gets lit
I got tears in this shit, what do you got? A couple?
Think you got a hustle, what d'you want, trouble?
Lookin' at the two who go back like Chuck's (Everlast: Way back)
With the hand on the pump by the big black trucks (Everlast: Fools)
You can't trust a soul in the City of Angels
The strange ho's want a piece, look at these lame ho's
I stain those, with hot blood and chain flows
And main foes who want to rock this ain't closed
They use the same clothes these unoriginal niggas
Ah, my son, if any one of them wanna run (Everlast: Come on, motherfucker)
You get chastised and baptized in blood
Where the gat lies don't matter, you're scattered in mud
You ungrateful, most hateful, leech niggas
Wallow in your misery, I'm outta reach, niggas

Two deadly assassins makin' 'em fall
I'm Real
Everlast
I'm Everlast, and I'm ready to brawl
B-Real
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Both
Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate
B-Real
Two deadly assassins makin' 'em fall
I'm Real
Everlast
I'm Everlast, and I'm takin' 'em all
B-Real
Just when you thought it was safe to make a tape
Both
Two deadly assassins sealin' your fate

(Everlasting)
(The round one)
