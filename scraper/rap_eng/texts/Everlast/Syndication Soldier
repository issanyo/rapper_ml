Here we are, my friend
Once again I'm inclined to rhyme one time
So won't you lend me your ear? 'Cuz it's clear
That this here has no pain
If this song was the blues you'd be sheddin' a tear
Like a baby, maybe, is should a held back
Some of you look shocked, I guess you couldn't tell that
I was here to drop knowledge, college is irrelevant
My next move, to prove I'm smooth but still intelligent
Expressin' the lesson with sheer precision
First hear me out then make a decision
On whether Everlast knows what time it is
Does this song belong in the rhyming biz?
Yes, I think so 'cuz I'm a pioneer
Blazing a trail across a new frontier
I go the length of growing strength as I get older
'Cuz I'm a syndicate soldier
All affections left behind, there's two more gears to grind
Before I'm through, I'm sure that you will find
A new respect for the rhymes I inject
Through your eardrum, don't play dumb
Just let me get to the point of my address
Unless you feel you can't cope
This song is on the table to make you dance, so
Get up, and if you don't leave the premises
I'm new to the crew so you can call me a genesis
Born to perform and please a large crowd
Of people at night and to my right is El-O
A scandalous brother known for being treacherous
A sucker made a move and that's the reason
Fletcher was forced to put his head out
He got too close to me, two by my side
And that's that's how it's supposed to be
These are my brothers, and they've been around me
Since back in the days when the Syndicate found me
They are the people deserving of credit
As my name gained fame, they made sure I wouldn't let it
Go to my head, instead I keep my feet down
Unlike sucker's from the past I beat down
The fatal mistake was to break on my confidence
Overall, their fall was due to overconfidence
As we go, the ego's all start acting up
With statements of greatness, the rhymes aren't backing up
Talking louder as they get bolder
But there's no defense against a syndicate soldier
As we reach the final stage
Some think I'll engage in a conflict
That's sick with violent rage
I gain fame from my name, Everlast
How long can this hype about a devil last?
It started as fun but everyone took it serious
Now it's seems, I'm seen as delirious
But that's okay, I'll stay under rated
And good things will come to all that have waited
For the brother of a lighter skin to begin
Droppin' knowledge with weight 'cuz you rate paper thin
Science is one thing, knowledge is another
What do I mean when I say that I'm a brother?
Being a brother is a state of mind
For all those who chose to remain unblind
I grow in wisdom as I get older
That's right I'm white and I'm a syndicate soldier
