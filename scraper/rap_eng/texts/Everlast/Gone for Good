I was foolish cause I loved her so
Never put no one else above her, no
She put it on me like no other did before
Now she telling me that she wants to go
She said she got dreams and she won't make fights
She say that she can act and she wants to sign
Wants to build herself a rep, make herself a name
I tell you girl, game recognizes game

And I'll be good when you're gone forever
And I'll be fine when you're gone for good
And I'll be good when you're gone forever
And I'll be fine when you're gone for good, for good, gone for good

You say you wanna be loved but wouldn't teach me how
Girl I don't even know how to reach you now
You say you wanna love but wouldn't speak no vow
Girl you ain't the one that can break me down
Take all of my love and then you spread it around
Girl I don't even know how to greet you now
I hope maybe you choke, I hope maybe you drown
I say, hey Joe, I heard you shot your lady down

And I'll be good when you're gone forever
And I'll be fine when you're gone for good
And I'll be good when you're gone forever
Yeah I'll be fine when you're gone for good
For good, gone for good
Gone for good, gone for good
