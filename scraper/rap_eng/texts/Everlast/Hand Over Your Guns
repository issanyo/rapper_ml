[Adil Omar - Verse 1]

I taste the dust clouds, the drum sounds, the guns are now a friend to me
Eventually, I'll self destruct, but tonight I'll crush the enemy
With all my heart and all my might, and all I know that's wrong is right
I'm trained to kill, to maim at will, a soldier - I was born to fight
An armored knight, some day I will escape from all these chains at will
Account for all this pain I've spilled, I question to this day until I
Until I know that this road I chose - never go back
It takes a toll on my soul and I know I'm cold and my hope stands
- so low. I'm drowning in a river standing frozen in a chilling breeze
A killing field where countless mothers cry and widows grieve
A future sinking in the blood of all the children bleeding
The aftermath from all the horrors of a killing season
Yet there's still a reason, I gotta set it right
Your people see me as a monster, I was sent to fight
My people see me as a martyr, facing death in sight
A false glory as I take my final breath tonight


[Everlast - Hook]

Once you've finished up your run
And everything is over and done
Before you hand over your guns
Listen son, it's a long way home

And once you really open your eyes
And know for sure the sun's gon' rise
What's certain is, every man dies
Ain't no lies, its a long way home


[Adil Omar - Verse 2]

I taste the dust clouds, the drum sounds, I know this wasn't meant to be
Eventually, I'll self destruct, but it's like you'll be the death of me
My evening moon, my morning sun you healed me when the scars had come
You stayed through all the battles lost and held me through the wars I'd won
You gave me all the strength I needed, built me up to all I've been
And sacrificed it all to be with, God knows what you saw in me
I told you that it won't be easy, wished that it was all a dream
Can't justify the things I've done or forget about the things I've seen
- I put no human being, deity or god above you
So even if the sky should crumble, I will always love you
I've seen my faith collapse, they tried to turn it all to rubble
You gave me hope although this journey's been a constant struggle
It's like we're all in trouble, trying to find comfort and solace
In a disaster, we're just fighting what this all builds up to
My only will to live and reason to win is I may never even see you again


[Everlast - Hook x3]

Once you've finished up your run
And everything is over and done
Before you hand over your guns
Listen son, it's a long way home

And once you really open your eyes
And know for sure the sun's gon' rise
What's certain is, every man dies
Ain't no lies, its a long way home
