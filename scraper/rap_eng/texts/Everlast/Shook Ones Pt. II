[Everlast]
To all the killers and a hundred dollar billas
For real dealers who ain't got no feelings
Check it out now

I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us
Official White folks murderers
My mobb comes equipped with warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got nuff shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nosebone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for their self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin'
Like they supposed to
They come around but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face
You're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they're whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight
My gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen but my mind is old
And when the things get for real my warm heart turns cold
Another figga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothin' really
Hey, yo dun spark the Phillie
So I can get my mind off these yellowbacked niggas
Why they still alive I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in L.A the foundation
If I die I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation
Getting closer to God in a tight situation
Now, take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

Chorus:
Son, they shook...
There ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
They shook
There ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look

Livin' the live with the diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
Some of 'em get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones
You ain't a crook son, you just a shook one

There's a war going on outside
No man is safe from
You can run but you can't hide forever
In these streets that we done took
You walking with your head down scared to look
You shook cause there anit no such thing as half way crooks
There never around when the beef cooks
And my part of town is similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and hold heavy on the cops control
You better have the right gear get ready
Tryin back me and get rock steady
By the mac one double I'll touch you
Leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick
Cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home puffin lie relaxin
LA got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
In the life filled with diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
But some get shot,lock-down,and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts say straight up shook ones
You shook

There ain't no things as half way crooks
( you ani't a crook son)
You sarced to death you scared to look you shook
(you just a shook one)
There ain't no things as half way crooks
(you ani't a crook son)
You scared to death you sacred to look you shook
(you just a shook one)
There ain't no such things as half way crooks
You scared to death you scared to look you shook
There ain't no such things as half way crooks
You scared to death you scared to look you shook

You ain't a crook son
You just a shook one
You ani't a crook son
You just a shook one
Just a shook one
You ain't a crook son
You just a shook one
Just a shook one
