Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
All the broken hearts and the unpaid dues
What you did to me, what I did to you
I ain't mad at you, boo
So what we gonna do?
I just seen you out with your new mans, lookin' kinda happy
Feelin' like somebody just slapped me
Gut's in a knot, my temp's gettin' hot
I wanna make that man bleed and wet his speed knot
He ain't got what we had, and it makes me kinda mad
I hurt my one true love, just like my dad
And it's kinda sad, 'cause now my shit's together
No need for umbrellas, I can see the stormy weather
I'm goin' outside into the rain
Like Keith Sweat, 'cause I can't house this pain
We was workin' for years, now I'm jerkin' these tears
From my lips to God's ears, girl, I did you wrong
So I'm makin' this song, to let you know how I feel
Before keepin' it real, may keep my heart concealed
And now I'm on the side just paitently waitin'
Watchin' on you and the time for updatin'
I can't hide from the truth, I know the pudding's in the proof
So I stand convicted, like all your friends predicted
But I think you'd be suprised on how this ends, brothers
We went from lovers to friends, we'll go from friends to lovers
So if that man make you smile, I guess that I'll
Just accept it, and respect it
I'll hit you wit' this song and let you think about it
Then I'll just leave you alone and be a man about it
