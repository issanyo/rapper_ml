Wish I could see beyond the filthy blue horizon
See what lies ahead of me
Perhaps I'd see the path of my own destruction
And avoid my destiny

She said...heaven and hell are one in the same boy
She told me...heaven and hell are one in the same boy
We all meet somewhere in the middle
She told me... heaven and hell are one in the same boy
I said it can't be true

Wish I could touch you in some totally new fashion
Prove to you girl I'm a man
Now I can't guarantee your complete satisfaction
So I'm, do you very best way I can

Chorus

Wish I could find some time to stop and smell the roses
But my land lord just won't let me be
My head is full of paranoia, neurosis, trying to consume my identity

Chorus

It just can't be true

Children grow and women produce, men go work and some go steal'n
Children grow and women produce, men go work and some go steal
(Heaven & Hell)(Here on Earth) (8x)
