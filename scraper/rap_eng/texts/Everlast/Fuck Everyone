[ VERSE 1: Everlast ]
I don't do work, do damage
Everytime I pick up the mic I manage
To diss someone or get somebody pissed
Take off my coat, clear my throat and begin to dismiss
All you fucked up punks that pollute mankind
Give me the mic, take a hike and give me peace of mind
Don't shout, shut your mouth, I'm trying to think clearly
You say my ryhmes are dope? Check this out, this is merely
The start of something big, a spark ignitin a fire
You think the party has hit its peak? I'll take it a level higher
I'm Everlast, get off your ass to cut a rug
You'll understand my gameplan and say, "Man that kid's bugged"
(So all ya bloodclots) tellin you like take heed
I'll stomp your heads until you're dead or at least till you bleed

Fuck everyone

[ VERSE 2: Everlast ]
It's the Syndicate, I'll say what I want to
I'll say, "Hey, fuck off punk," just to taunt you
Into believing the ryhmes that I'm conceivin
Are meant for only one thing, and that's achievin
My goal, so I can stroll with a fat money roll
Cross the bridge over troubled waters and pay the toll
With no bother, no fuss, in God I trust
But the rest pay cash - that's a must
The reason I'm teasin you is it's pleasin me
To see how funky this can be
When I grab that mic I'm like a three wheel bike
I'm always on a roll, I'm always good as gold
So before you smack lip stick and try to talk shit
I tell you now the battle's over and the joint is lit, so quit

[ VERSE 3: Everlast ]
All hell breaks loose and it's a little known fact
That I attract and cause a crowd to react
Like an atomic explosion on the Pacific ocean
The crowd gets large and I got this notion
All I wanna do is speak my ryhme and get paid
Cause it's my trade to the played and watch suckers get slayed
And put out of business, come on, what is this?
You came too late boy, class has been dismissed
Cancelled. terminated, put to an end
So break north, find a new school to attend
Cause you know I'm gonna say what I wanna
Grab the microphone and let my knowledge be born of
Intelligence, excellence and razor sharp wit
It's no shit, it's always gotta be legit
And up to par, no matter who you are
I know I'm not the best but I still leave scars
On your brain cell, what in the hell?

Fuck everyone

(Everybody)
Fuck em!
(Fuck em)
(Everybody)
Fuck em!
(Fuck em)
(Everybody)
Fuck em!
(Fuck em)
( *scratching of* )
(Everybody)

[ VERSE 4: Everlast ]
I got Tipper Gore protestin my lyrics
Fuck that bitch, I don't need a clearance!
To rock my ryhmes, speak my mind
You can't censor me, the public's not blind
It's time they knew what's going on
You shouldn't have the power to stop a song
Even if you don't like what you hear
Even if the song is striking fear
Into your heart, body, soul and brain
It's my opinion, so it's my domain
Fuck all those standin in my way
Step to me and you'll have to pay
The price I set, so pay your debts
Fuck with me and you'll have regrets

Fuck everyone

Fuck em!
Fuck em!
Fuck them!
Fuck em!
I said fuck em!
Fuck em now!
Fuck em!
Fuck them now!
Fuck em!

Yeah
And fuck you!
Fuck em!
Hahahahaha
