Here we are, my friend
Once again
I'm inclined to rhyme one time
So won't you lend me your ear?
Cuz it's clear
That this here has no pain
If this song was the blues you'd be sheddin a tear
Like a baby
Maybe
Is shoulda held back
Some of you look shocked
I guess you couldn't tell that
I was here to drop knowledge
College is irrelevant
My next move
To prove I'm smooth but still intelligent
Expressing
Lessons with sheer precision
First hear me out then make a decision
On whether Everlast knows what time it is
Does this song belong in the rhyming biz?
Yes, I think so, cuz I'm a pioneer
Blazing the trail across a new frontier
I'm growing lengths of growing stregth as I get older
Cuz I'm a syndicate soldier

All affections left behind
There's two more gears to grind
Before I'm through
I'm sure that you will find
A new respect for the rhymes I inject
Through your eardrum
Don't play dumb
Just let me get to the point of my address
Unless you feel you can't go
This song is on the tables to make you dance, so
Get up, and if you don't, leave the premises
I'm Rula-Ku so you can call me a genesis
Born to perform and please a large crowd
Of people at night and to my right is El-o
The scale is brother
Known for being treacherous
A sucker made a move and that's the reason
Fletcher was forced to put his head out
He got too close to me
Two by my side
And that's that's how it's supposed to be
These are my brothers
And they've been around me
Since back in the days when the Syndicate found me
They are the people deserving of credit
List my name, gained fame, and made sure I wouldn't let it
Go to my head
Instead
I keep my feet down
Unlike sucker's from the past I beat down
The fatal mistake was to break on my confidence
Overall, their fall was due to overconfidence
As we go, the ego's
All start acting up
With statements
Of greatness, the rhymes aren't backing up
Talking louder as they get bolder
But there's no defense
Against a syndicate soldier

As we reach the final stage
Something got engaged
In a conflict
That's sick with violent rage
I gained fame
From my name, Everlast
How long can this hype about a devil last?
A star was formed, but everyone took it serious
Now it's seems, I'm seen as delirious
That's okay, I'll stay under rated
And good things will come to all who have waited
For the brother of a lighter skin to begin
Droppin' knowledge with weight
Cuz you rate paper thins
Science is one thing, knowledge is another
What do I mean when I say that I'm a brother?
Being a brother is a state of mind
For all those who chose to remain unblind
Growing wisdom as I get older
That's right I'm white and I'm a syndicate soldier
