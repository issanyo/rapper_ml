Girl, I wanna die in yer arms tonight
Really don't care 'bout the wrong or right
The fruit is forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe
Think I'm gon' pick me some and take me a bite

Baby girl looks so good, she walks so mean
Got a vicious little sway, I think she's semi-obscene
She'll pick ya bones clean, oh my God, she's so fine
She sweeter than the dew out on the grapes on the vine

I'm a picker, I'm a squeezer, I'm-a make me some wine
I'm a drinker 'til I'm crazy, I'm-a drink 'til I'm blind
I'm-a touch her so good
I'm-a treat her so fine
I'm-a make love to her soul
I'm gonna fuck 'er with her mind

I'm gonna die in yer arms tonight
I really don't care 'bout the wrong or right
The fruit is forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe
Think I'm gon' pick me some and take me a bite

Baby girl acts so proper, like daddy's little daughter
A wolf in sheep's clothing leading lambs out to the slaughter
She's lookin' so young, she's smellin' so pretty
She's a junkie on a binge, and her drug is the city

She's a vicious little biddy
Attitude is shitty
An' if I get my way, she pro'ly gonna come home with me
Talkin' good for nothin'
Eyes were made for cryin'
Bombs were made for droppin'
Girl, yer arms are made for dyin'

I'm-a die in yer arms tonight
I really don't care 'bout the wrong or right
The fruit is forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe
Think I'm gon' pick me some and take me a bite

I'm-a die in yer arms tonight
I really don't care 'bout the wrong or right
The fruit is forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe
Think I'm gon' pick me some and take me a bite

Die in yer arms tonight
Care 'bout the wrong or right
Forbidden, but it's sweet and it's ripe
Pick me some and take me a bite
