My heart is broke, my will is gone
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon
She hook me to the gill, all of her forbidden thrill
I call her baby for short, then I ramble on

She'll forget about me

My soul is high, my mind is free
Met a shorty with some back, called her destiny
She showed me all my fates, my stream of conscious navigates
I orbit around the sun at high velocity

Don't forget about me
Don't forget about

Sweet thing, won't you save my soul?
Pretty lady, won't you take me home?
Sweet thing, won't you save my soul?
Pretty lady, won't you take me home
Tonight?

My arms are heavy, my body's tense
Got the hots for this honey named confidence
She points out all of my flaw, breaking all of her favorite law
Never speaks a word in my defense

Just forget about me

My spirit's weak, my lust will thrive
Got a thing for this bitch, said her name's a lie
She controls me with her fear, my prayers fall on her cold deaf ear
She says, “Have a good time then take your dive”

Just forget about me
Just forget about

Sweet thing, won't you save my soul? Yeah
Pretty lady, won't take me home?
Sweet thing, won't you save my soul? Yeah
Pretty lady, won't take me home
Tonight?

I got a Babylon feelin'
I got a Babylon feelin'
I got a Babylon feelin'
I'm feelin' Babylon

My heart is broke, my will is gone
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon
She hook me to the gill, all of her forbidden thrill
I call her baby for short, then I ramble on
Then I ramble on

I got a Babylon feelin'
I got a Babylon feelin'

I got a Babylon feelin', feelin', feelin'
I got a Babylon feelin', feelin', feelin'
Got a Babylon feelin', feelin', feelin'
Got a Babylon feelin', feelin', feelin'
