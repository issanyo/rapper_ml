My heart is broke, my will is gone
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon
She hook me to the gills all of her forbidden thrills
I call her baby for short then I ramble on
She'll forget about me, my soul is high, my mind is free
Met a shorty with some back call her destiny
She showed me all my fates, my stream of conscious navigates
I orbit 'round the sun at high velocity
Don't forget 'bout me, don't forget about sweet things
Won't you save my soul Pretty lady, won't you take me home...tonight
My arms are heavy, my body's tense
Got the hot's for this honey named confidence
She points out all of my flaws, breaking all of her favorite laws
Never speaks a word in my defense, just forget about me
My spirit's weak, my lust will thrive, got a thing for this bitch
Said her name is a lie, she controls me with her fear
My prayers fall on her cold deaf ear
She says have a good time and take your dive
Just forget about me
Just forget about, sweet things, won't you save my soul yeah
Pretty lady, won't you take me home
Sweet thing won't you save my soul yeah
Pretty lady won't you take me home... tonight
I've got a Babylon feelin', I've got a Babylon feelin'
I've got a Babylon feelin', I'm feelin' Babylon
My heart is broke, my will is gone
Fell in love with a woman named Babylon
Shook hook me to the gills, all of her forbidden thrills
I call her baby for short, then I ramble on, and I ramble on
I've got a Babylon feelin'
I've got a Babylon feelin'
I've got a Babylon feelin' Feeln', Feeln', Feeln' yeah
I've got a Babylon feelin' Feeln', Feeln', Feeln' yeah
