EVERLAST:
Yea, check it out now

EVERLAST & DANNY BOY:

Everybody check it out now

EVERLAST:
Yo, I got the corn beef

DANNY BOY:
I got the Mott's

EVERLAST:
I got the shotty

DANNY BOY:
Ay yo, I got the buck shot

EVERLAST:
Ay yo, I got the burgers

DANNY BOY:
I got the grill

EVERLAST:
If you're steppin' up next

EVERLAST & DANNY BOY:
Ya better flex that skill

EVERLAST:
The House Of Pain is in full effect
Everybody in the place give full respect
If your girl's in the house keep the ho in check
And if I'm bustin' off caps, you better hit the deck
Steppin' on stage with the fly routines
I'm hemmin' up suckers like bell bottom jeans
I always switch trains in Jamaica, Queens
When I go to by the street to see my Aunt Eileen

DANNY BOY:
Danny Boy's comin' with the Irish style
The money back guarantee, I make it worth your while
I'm layin' out fools like kitchen tile
You come around with a frown, and ya leave in a pile

EVERLAST:
Step back man, I ain't a black man
But everytime I grab the mike I rock a phat jam
Without the Slimfast, and if a skim pass
You know I step up and give the ho a jim blast
I give her what she wants, even if she fronts
The Hill is down with the House, they got the philly blunts
Ya know we roll 'em up, and then we light 'em up
And then we puff them up and pass them
So Danny Boy blasts 'em

DANNY BOY:
I got the shell-toe Adidas, with the fat strings
The Celtic crosses and the Claddagh rings
The straight edges razor and the Mossberg pump
You heard me shit clickin', now it's time to jump

EVERLAST:
Jump around just like a frog on a log
Fuck the Dukes because I like Boss Hogg
I'm hittin' home runs like my man Wade Boggs
And if you try to act stupid, I'm droppin' the dogs

EVERLAST & DANNY BOY:
Everytime I go to town
People start kickin' my dog around
It makes no difference if my dog's a hound (hound)
You better stop kickin' my dog around

Chorus
Put on your shit kickers and kick some shit (4x)

EVERLAST:
Now I've droppin' records since the age of seventeen
First I came solo, but I now I got a team
It's the four man crew, with the Irish stew
You catch us puffin' on a blunt, and sippin' a brew

DANNY BOY:
What's up with that brew, man, hurry up and finish
Now grab the bar maid and order me another Guinness

EVERLAST:
You can drink the Guiness while I'm sippin' on the Mickey's
When it comes to hookers, yo, the Everlast is picky
Always got my hat in case I come across a quicky
And when I do my shows I get the hoes all hot and sticky

EVERLAST & DANNY BOY:
The House Of Pain is in full effect, yea
I say the House Of Pain is in full effect
You know the House Of Pain is in full effect, yea
And anyone who steps up is gettin' wrecked

Chorus 2X

EVERLAST:
Check it out now!  Owww!
I said the House Of Pain!
We out
