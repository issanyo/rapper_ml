One time around the block, two times around the clock, three times don't cross the little lady
So pretty and oh so bold, got a heart full of gold on a lonely road
She said "I don't even think that god can save me"
Am i gaining ground, am i losing face, have i lost and found my saving grace
Thankful for the gift my angels gave me
Born alone, we die alone
Now I'm just sitting here by the phone, waiting for the lord to send my calling
Street wise from the boulevard
Jesus only knows that she tries too hard, she's only trying to keep the sky from falling
Any man that says its heaven and hell, has probably got something useless to sell
You ask me if I'm saved, but whats it to ya
Blow a quarter, cop another eighth
You're running out of high, you're losing your faith, just throw your hands up and scream Hallelujah
Hallelujah(x4) amen
One time around the sun, another year older and my work ain't done
It's time for me to write the final chapter
Deal the cards and roll the dice sex, drugs, and rock & roll are my only vice
I'm trying to figure out just whats here after
Hallelujah(x6)
Amen
