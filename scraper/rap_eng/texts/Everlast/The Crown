With a soft underbelly
And a hardened heart
They say you've got to be tough
If you ain't that smart
I'm sitting here alone
Waiting for my phone to ring

Run out of time
Run out of hope
The boys on the corner never run out of dope
I keep myself high
So I can keep doing my thing

They say "Stupid is as stupid does
And everything's the same as it ever was"
I drink myself blind
Trying to find a new song to sing

Time is money
And money talks
Bartender, pour me one more whiskey on the rocks
While i try to understand
Why every man wants to be king

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
(wears the crown)
Everybody kicks you when you're down
(when you're down)
Laugh for now; later you can frown
(you can frown)
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
(wears the crown)

With a sweet disposition
And an iron will
A couple nice cars
And a house on a hill
My back account's full
But my soul is still empty and cold
All the money and the clothes
And the sold out shows
Don't mean a damn thing when nobody knows you
And your home is just a house
When you're sitting there alone and you're old

I heard love is a game
I heard love is a rock
And I heard love is a house on a dead end block
But the ending keeps changing every time that the story gets told

Some pray for money
Some pray for rain
And some are just praying for relief from the pain
But some of us will buy
Just about anything we can be sold

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
(wears the crown)
Everybody kicks you when you're down
(when you're down)
Laugh for now; later you can frown
(you can frown)
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
(wears the crown)

I'm a mean old dog
Got a big old gun
I'm a proud new papa
I'm an only son
I'm a beggar
I'm a thief
I'm a liar and a cheater too

I've been around the block
I've been around the sun
I've been up
I've been down
I've been over and done
I've seen the bottom of the pile
And the mountain top
Either will do

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
(wears the crown)
Everybody kicks you when you're down
(when you're down)
Laugh for now; later you can frown
(you can frown)
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
(wears the crown)
