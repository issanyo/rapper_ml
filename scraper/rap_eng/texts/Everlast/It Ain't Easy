[Verse 1]
I got a heart with a zipper and
I got a scar from the stitches and
I got nothin' on my hands but time
I'm tryna get an upper hand
Find a woman that'll understand
Waiting on some kind of sign

[Chorus]
I know it ain't easy
Sometimes waiting is the hardest part
Ain't easy
When your whole world keep falling apart
Ain't easy
Tryna get right from the very start
Ain't easy
Sometimes waiting is the hardest part

[Verse 2]
And now world is a picture frame
And I can almost hear a name
I need a woman that'll made me kinder
I got a wish in a photograph
Of a woman that'll made me laugh
Don't worry that I'm never gon' find her
Just take your time
Don't waste your time

[Chorus]
Ain't easy
Sometimes waiting is the hardest part
Ain't easy
When your whole world keep falling apart
Ain't easy
Tryna get right from the very start
Ain't easy
Sometimes waiting is the hardest part (hmm-mmm)
Ain't easy (No, it ain't easy)
Sometimes waiting is the hardest part (Ohhh)
Ain't easy (Ain't easy)
Whole world keep falling apart (whole world, yeah)
Ain't easy
Tryna get right from the very start (I know)
Ain't easy (No, it ain't easy)
Sometimes waiting is the hardest part (Ohhh)
No, it ain't easy, ohhh
No, it ain't easy
