Everybody meets their maker
Everyone, they feel the fire
Everybody's on the takin'
Everyone's a fuckin' liar
Everyone's another suspect
Everybody's on the run
Everybody fears the box 'n'
Everyone respects the gun

Everybody's got each other
Everyone is on their own
Everywhere is overcrowded
Everybody is all alone
Everyone they need somebody
Everybody needs someone
Everybody fears the box 'n'
Everyone respects the gun

Everybody is a winner
Everyone done lost their mind
Everybody is just a sinner
Every day is borrowed time
Everyone's another suspect
Everybody's on the run
Everybody fears the box 'n'
Everyone respects the gun

Everyone respects the gun
