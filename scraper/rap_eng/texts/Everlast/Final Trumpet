You ain't seen the things I seen
You don't wanna know this thing I know
It's like a nightmare, like a dream
Hear the final trumpets blow

Takes near everything I got
Seeing through the darkest spot
When the have-some will have none
Lookin' through the darkest spot
Who's gonna stop the comin' rain?
Who's gonna wash away the stain?
Who's gonna save the day?
Who's gonna light the way?
Who's gonna stop the comin' rain?

You ain't seen the things I seen
You don't wanna know this thing I know
It's like a nightmare, like a dream
Hear the final trumpets blow

You ain't seen the things I seen
You don't wanna know this thing I know
It's like a nightmare, like a dream
Listen to the final trumpets blow

Listen to the final trumpet blow
Listen to the final trumpet blow
