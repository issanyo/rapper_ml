Please, please, please don't
Leave me now, girl
After all I've done for you

On my knees here
Let's work it out, woman
After all that we've been through

I told you that Everyone cheats, everyone lies
Everyone suffers and everyone cries
Old people laugh, young people try
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes

Everyone cheats, everyone lies
Everyone hustles and everyone strives
Bad people win, good people die
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes

Hush your mouth, girl
And settle down, woman
'Cause you don't make no sense

Make up your mind, girl
And come around now
Come down from off that fence

Don't you know everyone cheats, everyone lies
Everyone suffers and everyone cries
Old people laugh, young people try
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes

Everyone cheats, everyone lies
Everyone hustles and everyone strives
Bad people win, good people die
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes

Watch your temper, girl
And calm your nerves down
Better watch how you react

Put your hands down
And back up off me, woman
'Cause you might get touched back

I told you that everyone cheats, everyone lies
Everyone suffers and everyone cries
Old people laugh and young people try
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes

Everyone cheats, everyone lies
Everyone hustles and everyone strives
Bad people win, good people die
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes

Everyone cheats, everyone lies
Everyone suffers and everyone cries
Old people laugh and young people try
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes

Everyone cheats, everyone lies
Everyone hustles and everyone strives
Bad people win, good people die
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes

When they look in your eyes
When they look in your eyes
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes
