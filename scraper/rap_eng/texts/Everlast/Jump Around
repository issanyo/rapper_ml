Pack it up, pack it in
Let me begin, I came to win
Battle me? that's a sin
Won't ever slack up, punk you'd better back up
Try and play the role, yo, the whole crew will act up
Get up, stand up, come on throw your hand up
If you've got the feeling, jump up touch the ceiling
Muggs let's the funk flow, someone talk junk, yo
Bust'em in his eye, take the punk's ho
Feel it, funk it, amps in the trunkin
Got more rhymes than there's cops at a Dunkin'
Donuts shop, sure nuff' I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pop

[hook]
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat everybody, jump around
Everybody jump around (x3)
From town to town, from bed to bed
It's like I said
We jump around
Everybody jump around

I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl'd step up, I'd still smack that ho
Word to your moms I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the bible's got psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me they gettin' burned
Cause I got lyrics and you ain't got none
So if you come to battle bring that shotgun
But if you do you're a fool cause you know I duel to the death
Step to me and take your last breath
I gots the skill, come get your fill
Cause when I shoot to give, I shoot to kill

[hook]

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig less a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try and play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't goin' out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style - I might switch it up
Up and around, buck buck you down
Put out your head then you wake up in the "Dawn of the Dead"
I'm comin' to get ya, I'm comin' to get ya
Spittin' out lyrics, homie I'll wet ya

[hook]
