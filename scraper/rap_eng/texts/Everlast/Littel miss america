It's all been said, it's all been done
The war is over, the battle's won
Sour grapes, sweet revenge
Heaven starts right where hell ends
She was young, seventeen
She felt so soft she smelled so clean
Her aim was true, her heart was pure...
Until the day that her daddy walked out the door
She's lookin for a man and so much more
But her Uncle Sam sent him off to war

And Little Miss America, in all of your glory
She love the paparazzi, she's tryin to sell her story
She's gonna write a movie, she wanna be a star
But Little Miss America, where did you get that scar?

Desert sun, blazin sand
Love in my heart, gun in my hand
Lost a leg, killed a man
In mortal combat, hand to hand
Saw men killed, watched men die
So many times that I can't cry
It's been eighteen months since I've seen home...
I get a purple heart, a good G.I. Loan
They say God blesses every child with his own
But we're all gonna die in the dark alone

And Little Miss America, in all of your glory
She love the paparazzi, she's tryin to sell her story
She's gonna write a movie, she wanna be a star
But Little Miss America, where did you get that scar?

Back at home, it's kind of strange
Ain't nuttin happenin, ain't nuttin changed
Same old rules, same old game
Still I'm haunted by the names
Of all the friends, left behind
They weigh so heavy on my mind
At night I miss goin out on patrol...
The desert went and turned my warm heart cold

And Little Miss America, in all of your glory
She love the paparazzi, she's tryin to sell her story
She's gonna write a movie, she wanna be a star
But Little Miss America, where did you get that scar?

Where did you get the scar?
Where did you get the scar?
Where did you get the scar?
Where did you get the scar?
Where did you get the scar?
Where did you get the scar?
