[Verse 1: Everlast]
Step to this Irish mac daddy
I'll light your ass up and smoke you like a fattie
With the whole crew we'll take you for a long ride
Little did you know you on the wrong side, son
I got the gun and I'm not scared to use it
Put your life on the line, homeboy you lose it
That how it goes, holmes
I blow domes when I rock mircophones
I can get swift to the riff from an old jam
I'm wise like an old man and don't take shit from no clan
Or a crew, or gang, or crew, or club
Wack MC's tryin' to rhyme it with my dub
Fuck the bullshit, the piece gets pulled quick
Fourteen pulls on my trigger, that's the whole clip
And if there's anyone still standin' thinkin' that they're runnin' shit
They can come and get some of this

[Chorus]
Come and get some of this (4x)

[Verse 2: Everlast]
Come and get some of this over here
If not, stand clear and you got nuttin' to fear
I'm livin' in a state of grace and it's a fucked up place
I'll put my gun in your face
If you step up you'll get broke up
It's no joke, blood
I write rhymes, drink beer, fight, and smoke bud
That's all I do, it's all I need
I buck down a little sucker just to watch him bleed
That's my style, it's how I do my thing
This is the House Of Pain and I'm the king
I come real with it, can ya deal with it
Or will ya run for shelter, though you barely felt the
House Of Pain in full effect, and if you come with disrespect
You can

[Chorus]
Come and get some of this (4x)
