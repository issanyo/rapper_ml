Yeah
The House of Pain

[Verse 1: Everlast]
I'm sick, demented
I came and represented
I rose from the grave
I had a close shave
The cops tried to lock me down
'Cause the Glock they found
Was stolen
Thats how I'm rollin'
Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
So I don't like Marky
Or the monarchy
Don't 'Start Me Up' like a Rolling Stone
I'll leave ya sulkin' like Macaulay Culkin in 'Home Alone'
So Get a Grip like Steven Tyler
I used to trip with the Divine Styler
Back in the days there were Irish ways
And Irish laws, stand up for The Cause

[Chorus]
When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man (4x)

[Verse 2: Danny Boy]
Well it's the D to the A, double N Y BO
Y? 'Cause I rock shit like Ronnie Dio
It's a Black day of rest quick run get the vest
I'm down with the Hill 'cause I still got the skill
To turn the party out
It's all about the skyscraper
Your girl caught the vapors
So I might videotape her
I make a lot of papers so I don't have to scrape the
Bottom of the barrel
I rock fly apparel
Now I could pull your card
Starting up the Harley Davidson
I got the gun, so the drama, you could save it

[Verse 3: DJ Lethal]
Well it's the mad bum Russian
Funky with percussion
From LA to Flushing
I get your girlie blushin'
I'll cut ya' like the butcher
[Everlast]: But it ain't Joe the Biter!
The old rock a loop cause I'm 'Super' like Schneider

[Chorus]
When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man (4x)

[Verse 4: Everlast]:
I'm ill, retarded
So don't get me started
I might lose my cool
Ya lose if we duel
'Cause I can stomp a hole in the soul of a punk
With the rhymes in my head and the beats in my trunk
I got skill kid
And I'm gonna milk it
For all it's worth, I'm gettin' mines on Earth
So step to the next head
Or like Sadat X said:
'He's gone and that's how it's supposed to be'
'Don't Stand So Close to Me' 'cause

[Chorus]
When it's time to rock a funky joint
I'm on point
When it's time to rock a funky jam
I'm the man (4x)
