[Intro: Everlast/Officer O'Malley Bitchkowski (Sample)]
(Give me some time to blow the men down)
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be twisted around and used against you in the court of law. I'll make damn fuckin' sure of it! You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, which you probably can't, one will be provided for you, you stupid, freakin', moulignan bastard!

[Verse 1: Everlast/Officer O'Malley Bitchkowski]
It's the bad lieutenant, runnin up in your tenement
Plantin' evidence on any black resident
New York's largest crew, it's the Men in Blue
We stick together like glue and make lies come true
My name's Officer O'Malley, I shoot you in the alley
And burn you like a cross at a fuckin' Klan rally
I got spics sellin' nicks in the L.E.S
I stay untouchable like my name's Eliot Ness
New York's finest, with my bulletproof vest
I confiscate the chronic, I let you keep the stress
That is unless you wanna try and test
I'm D.T. undercover, I lock up your mother
You're just another brother, you ain't a mafia don
Who the fuck's payroll do you think that I'm on?

[Hook: Everlast/Officer O'Malley Bitchkowski]
The Police Department is like a crew
It does whatever it wants to do
The Police Department, we're like a crew
We do whatever we want to do!
The Police Department, it's like a crew
It does whatever it wants to do
The Police Department, it's like a crew
It does whatever it wants to do!

[Verse 2: Everlast/Officer O'Malley Bitchkowski]
You know this ain't Serpico and you ain't Al P
I got it locked from Hunter's Point in the Square of Albee
From the Bronx to Queens to Brooklyn to Staten
We're the most organized criminals in Manhattan
When we come, we swarm in full uniform
When the blue lights flash, start runnin' your cash
It goes back to the days of Al Capone and Frank Nitti
Illegal business controls the city
Oh, what a pity, if your attitudes shitty
Fuck my money up, kid, and you'll be doin' this bid
If you spill what I did, I'll put a pill in your lid
Or get you bustin like a cherry waitin' in the comissery

[Interlude: Everlast/Officer O'Malley Bitchkowski]
Ahh, what's this? Crack? Is that a gun?
You stupid moulie fuck!
You're gonna be doin' some real time, son!

[Hook: Everlast/Officer O'Malley Bitchkowski]
The Police Department is like a crew
It does whatever it wants to do!
The Police Department, we're like a crew
We do whatever we want to do!

[Verse 3: Everlast/Officer O'Malley Bitchkowski]
I raid stairways in the PJs just for thrills
And pull triggers on niggers that won't hurt the crills
It's brought up to paper, punk, that's the caper
If we make this connection, I'll give you protection
And this year, the mayor's up for reelection
So rat out all the competition in your section
And the next day, there'll be a drug sweep around your way
So let your crew know, it's time to stay low
Keep up in the dough and you get the info
On what's goin down and we can run this town
Straight into the ground, while we rise to the top
There ain't no such thing as a dirty cop
Cause I plant what I want on any crime scene
I keep my hands clean, you know what I mean?

[Hook: Everlast/Officer O'Malley Bitchkowski (Sample)]
The Police Department is like a crew
It does whatever it wants to do
The Police Department, we're like a crew
We do whatever we want to do!
The Police Department, it's like a crew
It does whatever it wants to do
The Police Department, it's like a crew
(Blow the men down!) [*gunshot*]
