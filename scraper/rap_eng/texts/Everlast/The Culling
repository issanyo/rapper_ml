[Verse 1]
Fire sale, chemtrail, apocalyptic hieroglyph
Tired to riff, wind up stiff, find a spliff, smoke it
Light the fire, turn it higher, burn the wire, work for hire
Pure desire, dire stakes gets brokered
Colonized, gentrified, do or die, Semper Fi
Simplified sympathy, Marly Marl symphony
Cold chilling, top billing, body count, cop killing
Supervillain rivalry, body arch-nemesis
March from a Genesis to the Omega
Hit the Bodega, arm-legga-legga
Arm-head, mega, shine like Vega
Black Hole, supernova, superlover, Casanova
Golden Era terror, golden child whylin’
Reservoir canine, clans from the highland
Syndicate Assassin, heartbeat’s bionic
Ancient Masonic, Sons of Mantronic

[Chorus]
The Culling is coming, grab your guns
Stack cash funds, fathers, teach your sons
When politicians talk - assume they're lying
Living on your knees - much worse than dying
The culling is coming, grab your guns
Stack cash funds and teach your sons
When politicians talk - assume they're lying
Living on your knees - much worse than dying

[Verse 2]
Smartphone, spy drone
Microphone, God stone
Home Alone, Al Capone
Skull & Bone, Terrordome
Satellite, social life
Neophyte, troglodyte
Outta sight, parasite
Chocolate white, Canaanite
Satanic Vatican, tyrannic architect
Organic archetype, volcanic dialect
Titanic visual, ironic imagery
Iconic ritual, bionic symmetry
Sacred mathematical, live from the Tesseract
Surgically tactical, spine of a silverback
Sign of the zodiac, megalomaniac
Cardiac, heart attack, talking red, Walking Dead
Zombified, Columbine, all the time, fast rewind
Raise the flag, black it out
Flood the hood, crack it out
On the news, keep it quiet
Sell the lie, make 'em buy it
Fake a trial, start a riot, find a threat, classify it

[Chorus]
