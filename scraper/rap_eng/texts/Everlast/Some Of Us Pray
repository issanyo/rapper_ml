Some of us pray, and some of us sin
Some of us just don't know where to begin
Guilty-hearted pleasures, may contain some unorthodox measures
Can't help losing even if you win
Some of us pray, and some of us sin

Some of us live, and all of us die
And some of us laugh at the others who cry
Broken-hearted sorrow, got you thinkin' like there ain't no tomorrow
Some of us can't look each other in the eye
Some of us live, and all of us die

And some of us give, and some of us take
And some of us just lie in the beds that we make
Hearts all torn and busted, double thinkin' everybody you trusted
Can't always fix everything you break
And some of us give, and some of us take

Some of us pray, and some of us sin
And most of us just don't know where to begin
These guilty-hearted pleasures, may contain some unorthodox measures
Can't help but lose even if you win
Some of us pray, and some of us sin
Some of us pray, and some of us sin
Some of us pray, and some of us sin
