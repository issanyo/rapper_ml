Hey yo, what up Everlast?
This is Prince Paul, man
Yo, I ran into Trev on the street from Nasty and he said you're doing
This dope Celtic rock album
So I was like, "yo, that's my style...
That's what I do"
You know I got beats from back in the days
So I'm like, yo, why don't I give you a call 'cause yo
'cause you know I got that ill like, you know...
You know somethin' like "Jump Around" but it's
More on that like old lucky charm style type, you know
In other words yo, just yo, give a brotha some work
You know what I mean?
It's like I got beats man...
Dante got some beats, but I got beats!
Because yo, I've been doin' it for awhile
So yo, I got the joint. Call me...
You got my number, I got it
I know what you need...
I know what you need, man
I know you got dough
Give me a buzz, peace
