[Verse 1:]
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jacked up the spoon on the candlestick
Dopestick pimping on the one-trick pony
Yet she's kind of skinny, but she gets my money
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine!
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine!

[Verse 2:]
Jack starts hanging around with some fiends
Got strung out, sold the cow for beans
Told young wifey: "I love you honey
But you gotta hit the streets, go and get my money"
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine!
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine!

[Chorus:]
Girl, my love is gonna last, just as long as my high
You can trust every word I'm gonna tell you is a lie

[Verse 3:]
Jack starts track up and down the hill
Got to walk for ace but he told him to chill
Rain comes shine, comes snow then sunny
Get the fuck out, go and get my money
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine!
Get my money, buy my medicine
Buy my medicine, buy my medicine!
[Outro: overlapping the saxophone until faded]
Girl, my love's gonna last, just as long as my high
You can trust every word I'm gonna say will be a lie
Girl my love's gonna last, just as long as my high
You can trust every word I'm gonna tell you is a lie
Girl, I love you!
I can't see you, ha ha ha ha!
