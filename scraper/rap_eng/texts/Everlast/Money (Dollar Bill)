Dollar dollar bills
Deutsch marks, franks, yens and pounds
I rock the chopped up sounds from devinger dounds
Out the Ford Rover, up top in the boogie
I be loyal to my peps just like pooh to stud doogie
Never bearer bad news
Paying crazy dues
I'm blowing out crews and taming mad shrews
Like Bill Shakespeare, the fakes will disappear
The flavor in your ear is strong like everclear
200 proof, so put the match to the roof
And set this bitch on fire
Get rich to empire
About to strike back if you rock the mic whack
And thats the way it is cause yo its like that

(Sadat X) Money money y'all
It be the root of all evil
(Sadat X) Money money y'all
It makes you popular with people

I go back to the '80's
Like "Three Times A Lady"
When it was pussy for free
And crack for currency
It just occurred to me
Its time for surgery
I remove emcees like tumors
The lies and the rumors got me thinking of this dove
About time made social club
Yo word to my mama
I'm high off the trauma
Whitey Ford gets deeper than a subway train
And I serve lazy fools like fast food chains
All pain no gain makes the brain insane
Life in the fast lane deflates the cash gain

Chorus x2
Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all
Dolla dolla dolla dolla dolla bill y'all

(Sadat X) Everlast
It takes money
(To get that fly ass ho)
It takes money
(To see me rock a live show)
It takes money
(To get that last bag of smoke cause ???
Hey I'm about to gee off just like my name was Edo
Black kids call me Whitey
Spanish kids huerto
White kids call me king of this b-boy thing
If its broke than he fix it
If its wack the mix it
Can't none of you emcees ever fuck with these
You be crazy on my dick like some porno chick
For the style that I'm blessing
Ain't no second guessing
Can't heed the lesson, subtraction addition
The war for submission
Ain't no debate
Won't stop until I've eaten off a platinum plate
I want stocks and bonds
Plus the real estate
I want the iron gates and low interest rates
Plus a fly little spot
To bring all my dates
A little stash of cash, to put inside the safe
When times get lean
Y'all know what I mean

(Money money y'all)
Some be calling it cream
(Money money y'all)
Some be calling it feti
(Money money y'all)
But once I get it I'm jeti

Chorus x5

I want cash and checks
I want diamond rings
I want jewels on my neck and mad fly things
I want stacks of fat chips so I can take long trips
I want to sail the Bahamas on my own cruise ships
I want acres of land
I want papers in hand
I want stocks and bonds
All pros no cons
Hey if it smells funny then pack it up honey
I want the money y'all
I need the money y'all
