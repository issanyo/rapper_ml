Chorus:
Ends
Some people will rob their mother
For the ends
Rats snitch on one another
For the ends
Sometimes kids get murdered
For the ends
So before we go any further
I want my ends

I knew this cat named Darrell, he didn't have a dollar
He was Harvard material, Ivy League scholar
Had a Ph.D., had an M.B.A
But now he's waiting tables cause there's rent to pay
Companies downsizing, inflation's rising
Can't find a job, he's feeling kind of stressed
Doesn't even feel the effects when he says
"Forgot to count how many times" he "been blessed."
So he falls off track, starts smoking the crack
And once it hits his brain, starts to chain react
Sells the shirt off his back, shoes off his feet
He's losing all his teeth, now he's out in the street
And all of sudden he's like, Jesse James...
Trying to stick up kids for their watches and chains
But he's from business school, and he's nervous with the tool
So he ends up on his back in a bloody pool

Chorus
Ends
Some people will rob their mother
For the ends
Rats snitch on one another
For the ends
Sometimes kids get murdered
For the ends
So before we go any further
I want my ends

I knew this chick named Sally, she had a nice strut
Knew what I wanted, she was up in the cut
Swinging that butt, like race you out here
Only rapped the benz, and rocked the fly gear
Brand name wearing, champagne waving
Jewels around the neck, live style she's craving
Ain't no saving, she's doing enough spending
If you do the lending, she'll do the bending
Straight machine vending, it's money for take
Shopping sprees get her on her knees
And if you hit her with keys of your crib, you acting funny
Come home one day, find her counting out your money
From the Wetlands, all the way to the Apollo
If you're broke she'll spit, and if you're rich she might swallow
For the ends

Chorus
Ends
Some people will rob their mother
For the ends
Rats snitch on one another
For the ends
Sometimes kids get murdered
For the ends
So before we go any further
I want my ends

I knew these two homeboys, who made a lot of noise
Making money on the block, kids was on they jock
They was tougher than leather like Reverend Run
DMC, they was toting guns
And holdin' weight, goin' out of state
Stackin' mad chips, and pushin' phat whips
Fly jewels and golds, and got no job
And then one disappeared, and one got robbed
For the ends

Chorus
Ends
Some people will rob their mother
For the ends
Rats snitch on one another
For the ends
Sometimes kids get murdered
For the ends
So before we go any further
I want my ends
Ends
Some people will rob their mother
For the ends
Rats snitch on one another
For the ends
Sometimes kids get murdered
For the ends
