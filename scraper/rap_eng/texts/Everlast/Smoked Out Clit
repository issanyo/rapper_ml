Raw Dog
Yeah motherfucker
I drive a truck
I like pussy and I don't give a fuck
Smoked Out Clit get so fucking high
I like tacos, I don't even know why
All you putos gettin' on my jock
That shit's a joke like, "Knock, knock"
I smoke mad weed 'cause I really like weed
Anybody else wanna smoke some weed?

So send a letter to your next of kin (and put a stamp on that bitch y'all)
Our singer's son's a quarter Mexican

Everlast
So I broke out
Got my minivan loked out
Smoked out, loked out
You know what motherfucker, I don't give a shit
See I'm yoked out
Some bitches get choked out
And eyes get poked out
It's a messed up world
You've got to make the best of it
Living in a smoked out clit

Jason Ellis
Ass, ass
Titties, titties
I work for cunts in New York fuckin' City
Sometimes I smoke weed, yeah
Sometimes I eat shit, fuck it
Sometimes I forget shit, fuck it
Sometimes... fuck it, fuck it
Umm, fuck man, sometimes I smoke and I...
Yeah, a lesbian

Lisa Donnelly
So send a letter to your next of kin (The Brighton Envelope, bitch!)
'Cause Smoked Out Clit is dumb and violent (Free Nelson Mandela!)

Everlast
So I broke out
Got my minivan loked out
Smoked out, loked out
You know what motherfucker, I don't give a shit
See I'm yoked out
Some bitches get choked out
And eyes get poked out
It's a messed up world
You've got to make the best of it
Living in a smoked out clit

Michael Tully
Well they said that rap and rock, it couldn't never last
But look at us now motherfucker, down with Everlast
My pipe is always full, your one-hitter's cashed
That's why your mom is blowing me, that's why I'm blowing cash
Look at me rolling up a blunt inside a Cuban cigar
Look at me rolling in a Rolls just like a superstar
You see I'm on my microphone and so you know who we are
This sound is Smoked Out Clit, now here comes the keytar

Everlast
So I broke out
Got my minivan loked out
Bout to get smoked out
You know what motherfucker, I don't give a shit
See I'm yoked out
Some bitches get choked out
And eyes get poked out
It's a messed up world
We've got to make the best of it (best of it)
