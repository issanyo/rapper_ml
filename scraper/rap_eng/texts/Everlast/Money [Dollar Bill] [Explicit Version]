Dollar, dollar bills
Deutch, marks, franks, yens, and pounds
I rock the jocked up sounds from Devenshire Downs
Out the Fordham Road, up top in the boogie
I be loyal to my peeps, like Buddha stud-doogie
Never very bad news, payin' crazy dues
I'm billowin' out crews and tamin' mad shrews
Like Bill Shakespeare, the fakes will disappear
The flavor in your ear is strong like Everclear
200 proofs so put the match to the roof
And set this b***h on fire
Get rich, the empire's about to strike back
If you rock the mic wack
And that's the way it is, cuz yo, it's like that

Money Money Y'all
It be the root of all evil
Money Money Y'all
It makes you popular with people

I go back to the 80's
Like 3 times a lady
When it was ***** for free and crack for currency
It just occured to me, it's time for surgery
I remove MC's like tumors. The lies and the rumors
Got me thinkin of this dub, by Timex Social Club
Yo, word to my mama
I'm high off the trauma
Whitey Ford gets deeper than the subway trains
And I serve lazy fools like fast food chains
All pain no gain, makes the brain insane
Life in the fast lane
The flakes, the cash gains, for real

Dollar bill y'all. Dollar bill y'all
Dollar dollar dollar dollar bill y'all

It takes money...
To get that fly a** ho
It takes money...
To see me rock a live show
It takes money...
To get that last bag of smokes
Cuz the county took it from you when that a** was broke
Hey yo, I'm about to g-off, just like my name was Eddo
Black kids call me whitey... spanish kids wetto
White kids call me king of this b-boy thing
If it's broke, then fix it. If it's wack, you mix it
Can't none of you MC's ever **** with these
You be crazy on my ****, like some p**no chick
For the style that I'm blessin, ain't no second guessin
Kid, heed the lesson. Subtraction, addition
Reward for submission
Ain't no debate
I won't stop till I'm eatin off a platinum plate
I want the stocks and bonds, plus the real estate
I want the iron gates, and low interest rates
Plus a fly little spot to bring all my dates
A little stash of the cash put aside in a safe
For when times get lean
Y'all know what I mean

Money Money Y'all
Some be callin' it cream
Money Money Y'all
Some be callin' it fame
Money Money Y'all
But once I get it, i'm J

I want cash and checks, I want diamond rings
I want jewels on my neck and mad fly things
I want a stack of fat chips, so I can go on long trips
I want to sail the Bahamas on my own cruise ships
I want acres of land. I want papers in hand
I want stocks and bonds. All pros no cons
Hey, if it smells funny, then back it up honey
I want money y'all. I need the money y'all
