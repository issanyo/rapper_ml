There's a house up on the hill
Where you can just make out the ocean
There's a women there waiting for your hard work
All and every breath she takes is like artwork
And I think that I can just about touch the ocean

There's 1500 miles between me and my next real smile
I think I can just about smell the ocean
I'm full of unquestionable devotion
But I think I put a terrible thing in motion
The ocean...

There's a house up on the hill
Where the air smells like the sea
I left my heart up there, rusting inside the salty air
I tried to make it home but I lost the key
It's been 600 days since I laid eyes on your gorgeous face
I'm trying to make it home but I lost the key
I'm waiting for the lord to set me free
I'm wishing that you were standing here right next to me

There's a house up on the hill (the ocean)
Where you can just make out the ocean
There's a house up on the hill
It used to feel like home
There's a house up on the hill
Where the air smells like the sea (the ocean)
There's a house up on the hill...
