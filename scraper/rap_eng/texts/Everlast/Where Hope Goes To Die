[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
I shoot you out your body
Perform the s√©ance with a fucking shotty
I wear a ski mask so that nobody identify me
Grimy and grizzly, throw you to the pitbulls like a Frisbee
Then feed the pieces of you that they bring me
Baby, your arm, leg, leg, arm, and your head
Even God turned his back on you, homie, you're dead
Just a fragment of your former possibilities and aspirations
A casualty in the civil war of a gangster nation
My generals plot the death to millions
The media spread lies and cash checks for trillions
I organize crime: money and murder synchronized beyond time
I move mountain tops without trying
I move buildings like super villains
Throw penthouses of people and fist-fuck porno movie bitches
Like BangBrothers.com, got money in my palm
No love, no smiles, ain't nothing funny, y'all

[Chorus: Everlast and ILL Bill]
I come from where hope goes to die
(Where dreams get crushed and the bullets fly!)
I come from where hope goes to die
La Coka Nostra till I die!

[Verse 2: Everlast]
Peckerwood B-boy in the white man's stance
Where I come from, son, the wolves don't dance
They stand with their fists and talk shit like this
Y'all don't want drama, y'all don't want static
You fiend like crack addicts, comebacks automatic
Got a deuce-deuce in my boot holding five
Got a razor in the other one in case you survive
I rep the Gaza Strip, the hunger strike
Cousin, bite on your lip, do what you like
We ain't playing no games, you ain't honky-honk
When the cats with the guns pop the trunks and dump
And the pistols thump and the bodies slump
Going for Jihad, can't wait to see God
A child of the city so my attitude is shitty
The livest type bomber out for pure drama
Period, comma, P.S. fuck your mamma

[Chorus: Everlast and ILL Bill]

[Verse 3: Slaine]
I'm the white guy who gave the whole rap game a black eye
Fuck your bitch with a dick thicker than Shaq's thigh
You can't nod off: this is a crack high
Stab you in your fucking face with a jack knife
I love bitches who suck dick and half-dyke
I'm just sick, I'll beat your brain, doc, with a flashlight
A black Maglite, you other rappers fag-fight, we don't battle
I have your family crawling out the bagpipes
And the preachers preach, pine box and the fucking facial features fixed
Whoops, I mean fixed, pushed don't mean shit
When a dope fiend lean on a custom green whip
Everlast, ILL Bill, Slaine and D-Boy
Lethal, Left Cage, we got you P-Noid
We B-boys who destroy on both coasts
Tote toasts and sold coke with gold ropes

[Chorus: Everlast and ILL Bill]
