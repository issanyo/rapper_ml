[Verse One] [Bun B]:
It’s just one man, one mission, and one mind
With one button, one push, yelling, “One time.”
With one chance, one target, and one shot
With one second to pray, that’s all that Bun got
I’m slightly off-kilter, somewhat tuned out
And loony-toony, I’m looped up and looned out
So not being of a sound state of mind
I’m an example of western civilization’s decline
I’m a loner, a rebel, samurai solo
Balls to the wall and bolo out for dolo
Bad case of tunnel vision, one-track minded
Blurred by the bullshit and criminally blinded
Feeling like a refugee fighting for his dinner
My life is on the line and the line’s getting thinner
I know Hell is waiting for me and there’s nowhere to run
So I just flick the switch and it’s done

[Hook] [Bun B/Everlast}​:
When it’s a suicide you can choose your side
When it’s a homicide you can choose your side
When it’s a genocide you can choose your side
You can choose your side when it’s a suicide
When it’s a suicide you can choose your side
When it’s a homicide you can choose your side
When it’s a genocide you can choose your side
You can choose your side if you choose to ride

[Verse Two] [Everlast]
Yo Peter Piper picked peppers, Run rocked rhymes
Jesus healed lepers, Judas dropped dimes
Moses split the Red Sea, Mohammed took back Mecca
And Michael battles Lucifer for who collects ya
And Hitler killed Jews while Schindler freed ‘em
And Foreman was the champ until Ali beat him
Mobutu was a killer and this well-known
These Bushes keep acting like they’re Corleone
I’m the curse of Barabbas, I’m original sin
I’m Reverend Mao Zedong, Monk Ho Chi Minh
I’m in that Brian Jonestown Massacre zone
A little bit of Leonard Cohen to set the perfect tone
Call me Pope John Paul Wall, got a grill for all y’all
Jeff Dahmer wilding in the hall with the saws
A fine young cannibal, Hannibal Lecter
Killing bitches like Robert Blake and Phil Spector

[Hook]

[Verse Three] [Ill Bill]:
Fuck peace, war is the outcome found to really be right
I teach you how to make a shotgun out of PVC pipe
And make a molotov cocktail out of equally trite
Seemingly nice common household products
My teenage life as a boy soldier was inscribed in the blood of my parents
Now I kill for approval from my commanders
Barely remember my baby sister
Brainwashed to forget by this shady system
They were murdered in front of my face and I barely miss them
I’ve lost my soul, I’m numb from war, movies, and drugs
I’m a machine and they use me as such
Slaughtering way too many people to count now
Sniffing the brown brown, mountains of cocaine and gun powder
This AK-47 is God, these shells are individual angels of death
Guided by the most high
Programmed to purify anyone who approach mine’s
Suicide, homicide, genocide, we all die

[Hook]
