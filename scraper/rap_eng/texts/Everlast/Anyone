Verse 1
I got my pick up truck, and I got my gun, and I got a taste for whiskey and pills
I know I'm kinda far, coz im my father's son and i got a hole in my heart I can't fill
Turn off the parking light, down by the rivers end
This is my darkest night girl youre swimming in my head

Chorus 1
It happens all the time, i blow it every time
People change with time
Call me anytime girl
I miss you oh so often
Whats been said is done
Its my only option girl ill be anyone for you
Anyone

Verse 2
Out on the interstate, i play my radio
And i confess to all my sins
Been driving seven hours, still got 3 to go
Where it always ends, the road begins
You've got your broken wings
I've got mine sewn apart
Girl all these f**ked up things
They keep us torn apart

Chorus 2
It happens all the time
I blow it every time
People change with time
Call me anytime you like
I miss you oh so often
Whats been said is done
Its my only option
Ill kill anyone for you

Anyone
Anywhere
Anytime

For you
