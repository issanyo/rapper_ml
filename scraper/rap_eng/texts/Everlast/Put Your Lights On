Hey now, all you sinners
Put your lights on
Put your lights on

Hey now, all you lovers
Put your lights on
Put your lights on

Hey now, all you killers
Put your lights on
Put your lights on

Hey now, all you children
Leave your lights on
You better leave your lights on
'Cause there's a monster
Livin' under my bed
Whisperin' in my ear
And there's an angel
With her hand on my head
She say I got nothing to fear
There's a darkness
Livin' deep in my soul
Still got a purpose to serve
So let your light shine
Deep into my hole

'n God don't let me loose my nerves
Don't let me loose my nerves

Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
U-oho, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now

Hey now, all you sinners
Put your lights on
Put your lights on

Hey now, all you children
Leave your lights on
You better leave your lights on
'Cause there's a monster
Livin' under my bed
Whisperin' in my ear
And there's an angel
With her hand on my head
She say I got nothing to fear

She say
La ilaha il allah
You gonna shine like star
La ilaha il allah
You gonna shine like star

Let me fade away...
