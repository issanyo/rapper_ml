I say, hey, baby doll
You swing your shit like a wreckin' ball
5 foot 11 inches tall
Dark brown eyes, caramel skin
I ain't seen you all my life, sugar, where you been
Tell me, who's your friend, cause this is my man
So won't you set it off between 'em love cause that's the plan
Hook your friend with my man
Come sit in my lap
I'll listen to ya yap then
I'll bust my rap
I'll size up your gap
You size up my bone
It's thick and meaty like a hot calzone
Fresh out the oven with the all night lovin'
I'll freak the styles you like but don't get from your husband
And when I call just tell em' I'm your cousin
I got a dozen cousins just like you

CHORUS:
Reaching out to all princess and queens (all di nasty gal pickin up and nice enough in the scene)
Reaching out to all princess and queens (Pamela, Madonna and the one named Maxine, uh)
Reaching out to all princess and queens (Joanna, Monique and the girl named Irene)
Reaching out to all princess and queens (keep ya mind dirty but ya body clean)

Divine Styler:
And like the other jam, let's keep the doors shut
Your nut to mine, I murder thrust with no cut
I've never been sucked from neck back to butt
Hand cuffs and snuff as i watch you strutt
To the window you lez out with your silhouette
Then you bend low, lift my crack to my chest
I defend my manhood and cold represent
I command my sex with the harmony tense
Mystery's designed to quake the dove stew
Destiny's blessin me when i arrive D infects the C
You do me so slow i blaze your D
I nickname you lunar beam LSD
I be eyein' any queen who wish to see
If you can dissect me in my scientific scene
Sicko, baby i'm real
Red bone steel and Cherokee appeal

CHORUS

Hey shorty earth piece
Stop me dead
Had to cease in my tracks
Run up and ask
At any time in your life have you been blessed
No need to second guess
You be bangin' like that dress
Hangin' off your frame
If it's all the same
Let me throw ya my game
Hit ya for your name
Plus your area code
I might overload
But I won't explode, baby doll, until your ready
My name ain't crazy legs, hon, but I can rock it steady
Blowin' up the spot like Jay Paul Getti
