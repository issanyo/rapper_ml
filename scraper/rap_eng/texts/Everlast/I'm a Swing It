[Hook 1]
On and just on, and [x10]

[Verse 1: Everlast]
I'm a swing it
Watch me bring it to the next level
The grafted devil's
Getting funky like The Neville
Brothers from the Bayou
So why you wanna trip?
Just play the sidelines, kid
And wait for me to slip
Cause I can feel it 'In the Air Tonight'
But yo I'm not Phil Collins
I'm more like Henry Rollins
Cause I Search & Destroy
Every toy with the ploy
Tryin' to get what I got
You might get shot
Hot Damn! I'm a slam ya' like ONYX
Then teach you how to write a rhyme
Like Hooked on Phonics
Mother Goose ain't got shit on me
Cause I'll get loose at the jam
And wreck the whole party
I make 'em jump and mosh
Oh, my gosh
Just slammin in the pit
While I'm kickin my shit
They buggin' in the aisles
Cause I got mad styles
And ain't a damn thing funny
I get money in piles
Some people thought I died
That's just a rumor 'though
Others thought I fell off
But now I'm Numero Uno
Dos, not Quatro
Word to Kool Keith
I'm a break up ya teeth

[Verse 2: Danny Boy & Everlast]
When I die (die)
Bury me (me)
Hang my balls from a cherry tree (tree)
Let them get ripe (ripe) then take a bite (bite)
And if they don't taste right
Then don't blame D! (D)
You need to quit swingin'
The styles that I'm bringin
The Funk knuckled dragon
Who gits on the wagon
I'm not the 12-stepper
Don't play me like a lever
'My Mic Sounds Nice'
But it's not Salt N Pepa

[Verse 3: Everlast]
Well it's the man
With the plan
To get all your skins
The tip on my dick
Is where the line begins
So hoes form a line
Take off that swine
Strip your ass butt-naked
Lets see if you can take it
Cause I'll make you feel
'Like a Natural Woman'
Cause I keep it comin'
I'm the Everlastin'
Freestyle Assassin
With Soul and my goal
Is to bring a little passion
To your girl's life
Like the daily soaps
Throw her down on the bed
And tie her up with ropes

[Hook 2]
The Lyrics keep on and just on and
The Lyrics keep on and just on and
The Lyrics keep on and just on and
On and just on and on and just on and [x2]

[Hook 1]

[Verse 4: Danny Boy]
I'm just another Ranger with the Derry face
Punk motherfuckers beef about my race
You need step back, kid
And give me some space
So I can cold shock the party
When I'm rocking the place
Danny Boy's a rhymin'
I stand six five and a half
Don't laugh kid
The outlaw biker
With my bitch hitchhiker
On the 'Highway to Hell'
Cause I never tell

[Verse 5: Everlast]
Well it's the funk backbreaker
We 'Heat it Up' like Jamaica
Don't bring your woman to the party
Cause I'll take her
Hit the deck
Cause I'm down wit the hooleys
I got a trunk full of funk
Like the Groovie Goolies
I'm not the man
But I asked you, 'Who was he?'
Quik's got the hairdo
Just like Ruth Buzzi
Runnin' round town
Like ya' been to jail, son
But ya hit the swap meet
To get your hair and your nails done
Get off my sac
Cause your shit is wack
Ya diss me
And I'm a diss you back

[Hook 1 (x2)]
