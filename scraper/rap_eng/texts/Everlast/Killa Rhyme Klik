[Cokni verse]
Ar-kay
As we move..
Pussy must get bruised
Killa Rhyme klik will never lose
Bring a massiv-a posse and all de crews
Chop in ya tools
Then enforce killer bacteria and scores
Because..i'mma singsay
Yo word is bond a normal flavour
Life very short embri containing ingredients
Instead of the edifying education you could acquire




(needs completing)

Chorus:
Killa Rhyme Klik keeps the function live
Heads treat my lovely on the 1-2-5
I might socialize if I dip and dive
Cause it's the daily routine on which I thrive

I got platoons, I got regiments, I got battalions
I got ponies, I got mares, and I got stallions
I got planets, I got moons, and I got stars
I got jewelry, I got loot, plus I got cars
I got family, I got foes, I got an ally
It's the E man, you got priests and a rabbi
I got knowledge, I got wisdom, I got overstandin'
I got culture, freedom, you got a weekly meetin'
You have bless, you have blood, you have a sacrifice
You have guilt, you have shame, you got your soul on ice
It's a control device, can't you see my earth is in orbit
Lucy's holdin' product, that's why you can't afford it

[Divine Styler]
Yo E, drop that killer thing yeah that shit right there
The thing that keep devils clear and keep suckers in fear
I got a mission, and grace to match
I got systems of knowledge that none y'all can't catch
I got meditations of toaism and you got ism
I got the outer body experience
I'm easy wide than infinity, and i need clearance (gunshot)
I got the nine duplicated (unreleated) multiple lives
I got brothers who survive with me through the lies
I got sisters who wish to be exorcised
From D- to E to O, you will  hear the flow
Ghetto intelligent the 85 that don't know
I got the new word of god, in my flesh
I got the mind of Muhammad, psychology can't test

Chorus:
