(Verse 1)
There's a sickness in my soul
And I don't know, but I've been told it's uncurable
There's a darkness in my heart
Slowly tearing me apart, it's unbearable
A drop of blood, a lake of tears
And baby after all these years, you're still beautiful
And I've been loved, and I've been used
Cut wide open, scarred and bruised, I'm unbreakable

(Chorus)
Flesh it heals I know, hearts they never mend
Lovers come and go girl right now I need a friend

(Verse 2)
Walk for miles, talk for days
And I've been trying to change my ways, it's so difficult
You kick and scream, You curse and yell
And tell me I should go to hell, it's so typical
Touch my heart, feel my pain
Let me know I'm not insane, you're so merciful
Break your heart, I cheat I lie
And honestly I don't know why I'm so pitiful

(Chorus)
Flesh it heal I know, hearts they never mend
Lovers come and go girl right now I need a friend yeah

(Verse 3)
There's a sickness in my soul
And I don't know, but I've been told it's uncurable
There's a darkness in my heart
Slowly tearing me apart, it's unbearable yeah

(Chorus)
Flesh it heal I know, hearts they never mend
Lovers come and go girl right now I need a friend yeah

Right now I need a friend

There's a sickness in my soul
And I don't know what I've been told, it's uncurable
