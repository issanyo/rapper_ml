[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
You're the air that I breathe
You're the sun when it breaks through the clouds
You're all that I need
But I know that you're having some doubts
I'm down on my knees
I'm praying you'll stake this out
I'm begging you please girl
I'm sorry I let you down

[Chorus]
I'm broken like a promise
I'm shattered like a dream
I'm broken with all my pieces
Scattered round for you to see
I'm broken like a record
I sing the same old song
I'm broken like the heart of a man
That's run away from love too long
Girl what about you, what about you girl

[Bridge]
It's so hard to speak
I can barely look you in the eye
It's so hard to breathe
But I know I ain't afraid to die
Your breath is so sweet
Your kisses could get me high
My heart is so weak
But your loving could get me by

[Chorus]
I'm broken like a promise
I'm shattered like a dream
I'm broken with all my pieces
Scattered round for you to see
I'm broken like a record
I sing the same old song
I'm broken like the heart of a man
That's run away from love too long
Girl what about you, what about you girl

[Chorus]
I'm broken like a promise
I'm shattered like a dream
I'm broken with all my pieces
Scattered round for you to see
I'm broken like a record
I sing the same old song
I'm broken like the heart of a man
That's run away from love too long
Girl what about you, what about you girl
Girl what about you, what about you girl
Girl what about you
