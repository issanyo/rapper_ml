And I'm so dirty
Call me daddy
You're so sexy
You can be my bad girl

If someone hurt you
And you tried to hide it
I'd cut you deeper
'Cause I know you like it

The pain I got, girl
Could satisfy you
But I can't love you
I won't even try to

And that junkie urge
Deep down inside you
Couldn't keep my secret
But I know you'd like to

Girl you're never gonna get
Blood from my heart of stone
Some of us were just plain
Meant to be alone

I'm all out of secrets
I'm running out of lies
And I can see the end, girl
When I look into your eyes

And I'm so nasty
And I'm so greedy
And I'm so lonesome
Girl, I'm so needy

I wanna take you
And make you my girl
My willing hostage
My favorite prisoner

I'll be your owner
And I'll be your jailer
I'll be your lover
Girl, I'll be your savior

I'll be your alpha
And your Omega
I'll break your heart, girl
And you'll call me later

Girl you're never gonna get
Blood from my heart of stone
Some of us were just plain
Meant to be alone

I'm all out of secrets
I'm running out of lies
And I can see the end, girl
When I look into your eyes

And I'm so dirty
Call me daddy
You're so sexy
You can be my bad girl

And I'm so dirty
Call me daddy
You're so sexy
You can be my bad girl

And I'm so dirty
Call me daddy
You're so sexy
You can be my bad girl

And I'm so dirty
Call me daddy
You're so sexy
You can be my bad girl
