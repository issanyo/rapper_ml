Verse 1

Im at a strange point of my life, my spirit ignites
Im destined for heights, I'm so solid with the quest of the life
Im under pressure but the time is right
For me to look inside of myself, the time passes by every night
Im searching for answers meanwhile my faith does surprise
And my neighbours are looking at me with hate in their eyes
Quad and tea, the streets filled with death and lies
Was set up to die but we plant seeds to rise
So when day comes pray so a miracle will keep it protected
Some of us gotta go but you know it you expect it
I gotta believe, in more than I see,in something better than this, whatever it is
I need a quate before my feeling is gone
Maybe my feeling is wrong
But ill embrace it like a beautiful song
I feel something strong coming along
I can't explain what it is, but I'm relaxed till my mind is gone

Everlast
(Chorus)

Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away

Verse 2

This feeling is hitting me hard, my soul is scarred
The feeling is saw like I'm getting a message from god
Believin in cause, no one believes in the laws
The reason the strong breaks - a soul is lost
Im searching for my soul in a myst of boldest insanity
I'd vanity my home is a warzone callamity, randomly
Tragedies happen I'm sick of this life
I'd give in a minute the Vicapri is from stripe
Gotta bond with the new brothers, leditucci and
Cheddars survival of our mothers would be proud of us
When the day comes and we rise the high of our faith
And nothing can touch us, we dont the feel the mothers
Now the bees inside of my head, the life that I lead
Left me for dead and lost on the path that I tread
I blade so many to rest, from family to friends
We pretend it doesnt happen, but when will it end?

Everlast
(Chorus)

Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away

Verse 3

I gotta new thought in my mind, in a matter of time
Ill be in a sublime state of the spiritual kind
My family is holding me high, theyre nervous inside
I can see in their eyes pride but the eyes dont lie
If the celebration continues Ill follow my heart
And my home is being infected from the poisonous dart
Its fallin apart, I dont wanna see its demise
So I'mma have to make a difference to remember I tried
My brother and sister smiling as I leave in the night
My mother kisses me on the cheek and my father is quiet
No words need to be said as my patters begun, cause
Nothing can break the chain of a father and son
As I take a step in the street where my destiny lies
Tryin to focus, my nerves got my stomach in ties
Rollin in a club god damn these people are young
But needs to be done so Ill reach you over the ho

Everlast
(Chrous)

Day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Reaper's hold is tight
Lord take my pain away
