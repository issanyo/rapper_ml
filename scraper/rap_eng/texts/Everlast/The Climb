[Chorus]
I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
And every single day it's just another climb
Worked so long and hard and I still got nothing at all
There ain't no reason to this grind
Heart is cold, my soul is old, my wall is stone
If you came for free love, don't waste your time
I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
Every single day it's just another crime
Don't waste my time
Unless you came to climb
Unless you came to climb

[Verse 1]
Brick by brick
Flesh and bone
Bow here behind this all wall alone
Protecting this heart
Carved in stone
The stone is a diamond
It's part of a throne
Part of my throne, that's the seat of a king
I'm looking for a queen, I mean no more gin
Where you at, baby cat, what you tattoo be
What's your history? Tell your mystery
A private dancer?
Hold up, pause it
Baby, everybode got some bones in their closet
They just hating, it's all shit chatter
And the feels of a heart, girl it really don't matter
Lime to the lemon, lemon to the lime
If murder was an order I make your heart mine
I'd put it in a box to cherish for all time
Your love will never perish, girl, just make the climb

[Chorus]
I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
And every single day it's just another climb
Worked so long and hard and I still got nothing at all
There ain't no reason to this grind
Heart is cold, my soul is old, my wall is stone
If you came for free love, don't waste your time
I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
Every single day it's just another crime
Don't waste my time

[Verse 2]
Cause everyday the grind, it just gets harder
Unless you came to climb
And final finish line keeps looking farther
Don't waste my time
They need all the sheep out to the slaughter
Unless you came to climb
I'm brushing my teeth with holy water
Don't waste my time
One step away from my damnation
Unless you came to climb
Two step away from my starvation
Don't waste my time
Gotta my daughter's medication
Unless you came to climb
So I'll sell you a piece of my salvation
Don't waste my time

[Chorus]
I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
And every single day it's just another climb
Worked so long and hard and I still got nothing at all
There ain't no reason to this grind
Heart is cold, my soul is old, my wall is stone
If you came for free love, don't waste your time
I built a wall
I built it strong
I built it tall
And every single day it's just another crime
Don't waste my time
Unless you came to climb
Unless you came to climb
