[Verse 1: Everlast]
I rock the ill shit, ya know I kill shit
And then I build shit, get off my dillsnick
Cause I don't play that, my style goes way back
I kick my shit one time through, fuck the playback
I go off my head, you know I shave my shit
And ya don't quit, I say you don't quit
Cause I'm the Prodigal Son
Ya get well done, just like a steak
'Gimme a Break! Like Nell Carter
There's tarter on your teeth, homeboy ya got beef
Well then ya get broke, because my crew's no joke
The House Of Pain
Is kickin' up dirt and therefore inside the jam
Ya know we're liftin' up skirts, grabbin' on the snatch
Feelin' on the skin, I'm knockin' on your door
Honey let me in
Cause I'm down with the "Freak Mode" baby
I'm at my sexual peak, young lady
Ain't nobody cooler than my man Son Dueler
Don't ya fuck around, I'll smack your knuckles with a ruler
Just like a nun from a Catholic school
I'll make ya drool, and play the fool
Snatch ya by the ears, smack ya up like a queer
Take a puff off my blunt, and then sip my beer
Kick the mean style, leave bodies in a pile
Everlast is my name, I'm from the House Of Pain
You know that I never play the punk role
Cause I'm a white Irish man with a funk soul

Chorus
That's what it is y'all, that's what it is (That's what it is)
(4x)

[Verse 2: Son Doobie]
Smooth like Beretta, quicker than a Jettta
You're soft like a feather, you little bed wetter
Baby, baby, I heard you caught the rabies
Bitin' on my shit, I have to say maybe
Son'll be rockin' until tomorrow
Cause I've got the right one, like Ray Charles
Follow, swallow, the funk pass the bottle
Cause I get wrecked like if I crashed my auto
I'll play it, I'll win it
I've done it, I did it
Some say I'm kiddin'
But right at this minute
I'll freak it, I'll funk it
And like a country bumpkin
From Alberquerque, who's gonna carve the turkey
Ready, serve, entertain like Merv
Griffin, sniffin' panties, I'm a perv
The Doobie funk fellow, smooth like a jello
Some say mellow, complicated like a dello
The freakin' who's speakin'
Freaks it every weekend
Cause I'll be trick or treatin'
I used to drive a Lincoln
Drivin', speedin', hey rid, I'm readin'
I make more money than that kid Alex Keaton

Chorus

[Verse 3: Everlast]
I rip flesh, yes y'all, run for the mess hall
And get your grub while I'm rhymin' on your dub
Gettin' play at the club, then I step to the pub
And crack a brew, what the fuck ya gonna do? (Nothing)
I rip shit, kill it, cut your gut and spill it
Treat ya like a gas tank, take your ass and fill it
And take ya for a ride to where I reside
Put your face in my pillow, and have ya weepin' like a willow
I tax that butt, wax that ass
Bust a nut in your teeth, then wait for you to beef

Chorus (2x)
