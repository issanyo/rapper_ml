Government man keep calling my house
Talking ‘bout I owe, harassing my spouse
Gotta park my truck on another block
Cause the sub-prime loan got my ass in hock
Gotta couple good friends with helping hands
I need a brand new job with a health care plan
They closed the plant, they stole my job
Told me crime don’t pay unless you ask the mob

So I smoke a little grass, drink a little wine
Watch a little tube, try to kill a little time
And every single day I fall a little more behind
But i’m paying it no mind, it’ll all be fine

[Chorus]

I get by (got it good)
I barely get by (got it good)
I barely get by
I laugh not to cry
I stay a little high
I ain’t gonna lie
I barely get by
I laugh not to cry
I stay a little high
I ain’t gonna lie (got it good)

Party people in the place to be
Put your hands in the sky if you barely getting by
It’s on and on till the brake of dawn
Got to keep the rent paid and the power on
Yes yes y’all and it never stops
I don’t trust the government, I don’t trust no cops
We dip and we dive and we socialize
We struggle and we strive just to stay alive

I get by
I barely get by

When I finally get home I can’t relax
Cause i’ve been over worked and i’ve been over taxed
My bank accounts empty, all my cards are maxed
And I ain't looking for no pity, i’m just stating the facts

I voted for some change and it’s kinda strange
No it’s all I got in my pocket
I bought a few led’s, now i’m growing some trees
And it’s a sweet fking hustle don’t knock it

I told y’all before I would break the law
To put some food in my baby girl’s belly
Cause the senator man took a bribe in hand
And went and shipped my job to New Delhi

[Chorus]

I get by (got it good)
I barely get by (got it good)
I barely get by
I laugh not to cry
I stay a little high
I ain’t gonna lie
I barely get by
I laugh not to cry
I stay a little high
I ain’t gonna lie (got it good)

Party people in the place to be
Put your hands in the sky if you barely getting by
It’s on and on till the brake of dawn
Got to keep the rent paid and the power on
Yes yes y’all and it never stops
I don’t trust the government
I don’t trust no cops
I dip and I dive and I socialize
I struggle and I strive just to stay alive

[Chorus]

I get by (got it good)
I barely get by (got it good)
I barely get by
I laugh not to cry
I stay a little high
I ain’t gonna lie
I barely get by
I laugh not to cry
I stay a little high
I ain’t gonna lie (got it good)
