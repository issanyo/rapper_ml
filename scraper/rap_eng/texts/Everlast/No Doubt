Song:    No Doubt

Chorus:
No doubt, hold tight
To the break of dawn, to the break of light
No doubt, hold tight
To the break of dawn, to the break of light

Verse 1 (Everlast)
I say yes yes y'all, to the right beat
Get up everybody's 'bout to leap their feet
Get down everybody's 'bout to loose their seat
I be huntin' down crews like Pacino in Heat
Putting psychology in your biology, no scientology dianetic anaesthetic
You took bad advice, kid i'm mad precise
When it's time to get nice, i heat it up like spice

(Chorus)

Verse 2 (Everlast)
Come on, let's be real, you only think you can deal
That's why i'm holdin' the steal, i rock shit to make you feel like
Damn that looks easy, maybe i can do it
So you take a fat beat and put your wack rhymes to it
And God only knows what can make you persue it
For those who can't dance and clap your hands to it

(Chorus)

Verse 3 (Everlast)
You tell me you're the baddest and you get the most cream
But tell me what's the status of your self-esteem
Your frontin' on your jewels and your benz and your lex
All the bodies that you caught and all the females you sex
Yes yes y'all, true indeed, the sight of the world keeps me high on weed
Makes my eyeballs bleed but i must proceed
Yo that chick 's good lookin' but she's hooked on speed
Buy your first-row ticket, watch the vultures feed
Get your culture free from the lust and greed

(Chorus)
