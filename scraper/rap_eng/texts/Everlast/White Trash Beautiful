[Verse 1]
White trash beautiful, trailer park queen
She slings hash at the diner from eleven to five
She married a boy from school, thought he was oh so cool
But all he can do for money is drive
Out late hauling freight on interstate five
Prayin' he'll see home before his baby arrive

[Hook]
White trash beautiful, there's something you should know
My heart belongs to you
And you could have found a better guy
I'll love you till the day I die, I swear to God it's true
I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you girl

[Verse 2]
He lights a cigarette, his eyes half open
He won't be home tonight but she keeps hopin'
Drinkin' himself to sleep is his only way of copin'
She waits for him every night, she leaves the front door open
It's four am, I'm doin' 95
Tryin' to stay awake and make it home alive

[Hook]
White trash beautiful, there's something you should know
My heart belongs to you
I know you could have found a better guy
I'll love you till the day I die, I swear to God it's true
I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you girl

[Verse 3]
Her lips stay painted red, her name tag's crooked
Her heart's been gone a while with the truck driving man that took it
He keeps her photograph on his rearview mirror
She prays for him every night, she hopes that he can hear her

[Hook]
White trash beautiful, there's something you should know
My heart belongs to you
I know you could have found a better guy
I'll love you till the day I die, I swear to God it's true
I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you girl
I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you girl
I'm coming home to you
