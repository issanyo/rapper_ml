Baby, because
(I say, "Lord, have mercy")
This is for all you dirty bitches out there
Suck up on this motherfuckin' nuts
(I say, "Lord, have mercy")

I say stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's goin' down
I'm everlastin', forever on a roll
I'm rockin' to the boat, steamin' grey matter tone
I ain't sayin' I'm God, but you can graft this
Chances are if I'm a star I'd be Johnny Mathis
On some smooth shit, I'd be gamin' all the honeys
Hittin' Hugh Hefner with his Playboy bunnies
Check the Sunday funnies, I be readin' Doonesbury
See me after dark, love, shit be gettin' scary
I'll freak you like Carrie on the night of the prom
Let's keep it cool and calm, I'll start strokin' your palm
Work my way up your arm, start kissin' your ear
Maybe lickin' your lips, then pullin' your hair
Yeah, I'll freak the back spasm, then give the orgasm
And if my legs cramp, girl, I'll lick that stank
I got it sewn love, so you ain't got no worries
Hold up, wait a second, my vision's gettin' blurry

Chorus 2X:
Stop, hey, what's that smell
Someone laced dust all up in my L
Bitches start sweatin' once the pockets swell
Let's take it back fourteen billion cells

[Verse 2- Divine Styler]
Periodic measures to say my rhymes
Too much of this dope need growth-type slow
Off a poet's tree, let me blow my leaves
Shake off my roots and pull up my sleeves

Break a branchling wist stick
Lyrics for the mystical
Yo fancy, shake your chassis
Our transystem is torn MCs
I hymn-zen, then I'm casualies

Pot smoke-seeds, relativities
Seize it, I be on every first ability
Of chaos, a higher form of infinity
Gettin' me virtually supreme ID

Reflectors and tackers
At which my faster phrased words
Super-lax, break raps and MCs jump off wacks
Revolves and steers and still sees time stilt
I work for Real Bill Divine, it's lyrical chill

I say, "Stop", hey, what's that smell?
Someone laced dust all up in my L
Bitches start sweatin' when the pockets swell
Let's take it back fourteen billion cells

Stop, hey, what's that smell?
Someone laced dust all up in my L
Bitches start sweatin' when the pockets swell
Let's take it back fourteen billion cells
