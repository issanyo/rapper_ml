[Verse 1]
Straight out the casket, risin' up
Open up your eyes - can't you see me?
What the fuck is this? Madness, pick up my bones
Erase my name from off the tombstones
Alive and kickin, breathing the air
Call out my name, punk, and I'll be there
No question, my suggestions of the action
Caught smack dab in the middle of the blastin
Messin with me, you're messin with the best
Blaow, you're takin two shots to your chest

[Hook]
Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast comin back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a freakin' hole in your head
Back from the dead
Back from the dead

[Verse 2]
You can't disrespect it, I'm the resurrected
Back from the dead just to mess with your head
I'll stress what I said, but I won't repeat it
If you've got a cold starve it, if you've got a fever feed it
And if you can't feed it then why not blow
You may be positive and not even know
I rock the hardcore from the floor to the ceiling
I give sexual healing, I'll get your girl squealin' like a pig
My grave's somethin' you can never dig
I'll rock a mausoleum, back yard or colosseum

[Hook]
Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast's comin back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
House of Pain's in effect, nuff said

[Verse 3]
Skip the autopsy cause I never OD'd
I only puff boom kid, I never get ski'd
I don't sniff or shoot up, riff I'll stick my boot up
Your ass quick fast, Everlast don't jive
Just like Pearl Jam 'I'm still Alive'
(Look at all these rumors)
Spreadin like tumors, gossip and lies
Exaggerated reports of my demise
And if you beleived 'em, well then you got gassed
The media deceived 'em just like in the past

[Hook]
Cause I'm, back from the dead
Everlast's comin back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
And I'll put a freakin hole in your head
Back from the dead
Back from the dead

[Verse 4]
Like Steven Seagal I'm Hard to Kill
Like GG Allin I'm crazy ill
I'll beat you down with my mic, kick your ass with my Nike
Bust you in the eye if you tell another lie
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Thinkin I'm dead you must be smokin' dust
Come see me bust in the flesh it's a must

[Hook]
Cause I'm back from the dead
Everlast comin back from the dead (back from the dead)
You know I'm back from the dead
House of Pain's in effect, nuff said
Back from the dead.. {*repeat to fade*}
