[Verse 1: Everlast]
I deal out physical justice and actual facts
I keep my steelo hidden like a junkie's tracks
But if I roll up my sleeves, you wouldn't believe
The depth of the deviance that I can conceive
I overachieve, I'm underrated
I've got you under pressure, I'm over medicated
The biters wanna bite it, the haters wanna hate it
Got on stage at your show and I defecated
Every rhyme I spit is the ultimate
Truth from the pulpit, let's cut the bullshit
It's fucking Coka, taking over
The wrath of Jehova's like a supernova
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
I pull out my sword and I cut you down
The wrath of the Lord's what I'm bringin' 'round
Pay heed, take warnin' when you hear the sound

[Chorus:]
I represent what it means to be true to the game
Or what its like what a hollow tip'll do to your brain
They call me Mr. White, ain't a more suitable name
La Coka Nostra, it's a beautiful thing

I represent what it means to be true to the game
Or what its like what a hollow tip'll do to your brain
They call me Mr. White, ain't a more suitable name
La Coka Nostra, it's a beautiful thing

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
My competition's presentation is so damn weak
I'm all knowing with AK's like Mozambique
So gangster when I creep up, pull a trigger eagle buck
We don't give a fuck even Jesus is leakin' blood
From a distance you might wonder what he's seizurin' from
But on closer inspection you see it's the heat from the gun
That's makin' his body rise, homicide, I'mma ride
Like the Cyclone at Coney Island when it's drama time
Ill Bill, I'm a product of the projects, my conduct: Complex
I like hot sluts that suck my dick
I'm multi-faceted, a real deep individual
Limited to new pussy, new cars and new pistols too
This is who I am, you wonder how I kill a man
Millions of fans relate to La Coka Nostra we stand
For honor amongst hustlers, pimps, and thieves
A federation of terror in a war with the beast

[Chorus:]
I represent what it means to be true to the game
Or what its like what a hollow tip'll do to your brain
They call me Mr. White, ain't a more suitable name
La Coka Nostra, it's a beautiful thing

I represent what it means to be true to the game
Or what its like what a hollow tip'll do to your brain
They call me Mr. White, ain't a more suitable name
La Coka Nostra, it's a beautiful thing

[Verse 3: Slaine]
They call me fuckin' Charlie Hustle with his knuckles gnarly,
Puffin' marley with a muffled mumble sayin' nothin' hardly
Truck Denali e'rybody hottie
Buyin' snotty nosed hoes, totally out of our skulls
Soles on my timbos, powder white outta sight
Knuckles brashed as a baby, I donâ€™t even gotta fight
My teams high, we blast for funds
Our whole world revolve around cash and guns
DMS villains, the coke and the 'dro smoker
That poke holes in your ho's chocha
From the brokenest cold sofa [?] dough and MO's and old chauffeurs
You should know already now 'cause I told most of ya's
We bullshit with Bolsheviks, guineas, and micks
Kykes, gooks, spooks and spics
It's a cold world with ruthlessness
So let the lies lay six deep, the truth is this

[Chorus:]
I represent what it means to be true to the game
Or what its like what a hollow tip'll do to your brain
They call me Mr. White, ain't a more suitable name
La Coka Nostra, it's a beautiful thing

I represent what it means to be true to the game
Or what its like what a hollow tip'll do to your brain
They call me Mr. White, ain't a more suitable name
La Coka Nostra, it's a beautiful thing
