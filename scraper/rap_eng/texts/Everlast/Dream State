[Intro]
I won't let you

[Verse]
Walk it
Talk it
Show it, prove it
Slow improvement, check the movement
Play the section, obey the sanction
Surge protection, close the ranks in
Find a tempo lively up your body
Move with the rhythm man, and fuck somebody
Hearts get racing, souls get broken
Like gunshot wounds leave holes wide open
Some they mocking, some they hope
Pray they find love before the end of their road
Some turn to dope, get high as a reign
But some only cope when they disguising they pain
Some turn to they neighbor, some turn to they God
And some spoil the child while sparing the rod
And some point above while they pray for they schemes
And some say the love is only real as a dreams, like-

[Chorus]
All I have's a dream
That never was meant to come true
All I have's a dream
Loving you
All I have's a dream
That never was meant to come true
All I have's a dream
Loving you
(I won't let you, make decision on who did wh-)

[Verse 2]
Drop the hammer
Omega, gamma
Last one ever, all ties get seven
Lies get spoken, hearts get jaded
Memories blur once true love faded
Long has prisons of class devisions
Paper incisions in rash decisions
Hash based visions of assassin's hems
Cash based devils in the back with grins
Track the winds, energy's kinetic
Crack the lens, photosynthetic
So symphatetic, broken heart chalice
Hardened like callus, fueled by malice
Fed by anger, ruled by violence
Schooled and suffering hidden through silence
Love is so sacred, love is so pure
And love's the disease that you will not cure, cause-

[Chorus]
All I have's a dream
That never was meant to come true
All I have's a dream
Loving you
All I have's a dream
That never was meant to come true
All I have's a dream
Loving you
(I won't let you, make decision on who did wh-)
Uoy gnivol
All I have's a dream
That never was meant to come true
All I have's a dream
Loving you

[Outro]
All I have's a dream
That never was meant to come true
All I have's a dream
Loving you
(I won't let you, make decision on who did wh-)
...never was meant to come true
All I have's a dream
Loving you
(I won't let you-)
