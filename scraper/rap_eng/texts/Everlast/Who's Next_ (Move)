[Verse 1: Ryu]
Yeah
Come on
Uh

I got two turntables and a microphone
Keep the place jumping 'til the lights come on
Call your wife and tell her you ain't making it home
You're too drunk to drive and you're way too stoned
Trying to find the biggest guy in the bar and smack him
Got a belly full of Jameson and Bud Light Platinum
It's on, set 'em up for a few more rounds
An Irishman may wobble but he don't fall down

So when I come through (Move!)
Tell your bitch and your friends too, it's best you (Move!)
See I'm not in the best mood
What's up dude? (Move!)
You got something to prove?
Then go ahead and make a (Move!)
And I'mma show you how I do

This is not a cartoon, get your sitcom cancelled
On arrival 'cos you're liable to get hit with an anvil
Catch me outside I'll be handing out samples
All night, no threats, but I'll make an example

[Chorus: Ryu]
Who's next?
Hurry, hurry step right up
Who's next?
I can't keep my big mouth shut
Who's next?
I know I'm not a gangsta but
Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched

So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up
So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up
So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up
So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up, yeah

[Verse 2: Ryu]
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Somebody called the cops I gotta make an escape
See the crowd wouldn't move so I threw a grenade
Yeah it's a tragedy but I don't let it ruin my day
You can call me every name 'til you're blue in the face
But my pockets' green like a Saint Paddy's parade
I be getting shitcanned all day everyday
So don't go against the grain, just do what I say

So when I tell your ass (Move!)
Everybody start jumping
When I say (Move!)
Just follow instructions
Everybody just (Move!)
With a smart-ass hook
Now put your hands up (Move!)
You're not as stupid as you look

Now your boys getting hot
Haters all on my trail
'Cos I don't do a mic check
Unless the check's in the mail
Trying to do it like me
But the comparison's pale
'Cos even if my raps suck
It's still catchy as hell

[Chorus: Ryu]
Who's next?
Hurry, hurry step right up
Who's next?
I can't keep my big mouth shut
Who's next?
I know I'm not a gangsta but
Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched

So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up
So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up
So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up
So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up, yeah

[Sample: Marvin Gaye - Stubborn Kind of Fellow]
Wanna love you in
Wanna love you in
Wanna love you in every way

[Sample: Gangs, Cops & Drugs]
Goddamnit you stop that shit now
Now wait a minute, wait a minute, hey man
Wait a minute

[Verse 3: Everlast]
Hey yo, dip-dip diver spit your saliva
Drink my face numb and smack my Uber driver
Cold getting dumb and dumber all summer
Dump on all comers and trump your front runner
South California boy tried to warn ya
Running up on you like Prefontaine
Nike's on my feet, Divine Styler on the beat
Boy I still eat off the House of Pain

So just sit down
Shut the fuck up
If you're looking for a problem boy you lucked up
And if you're wearing truck jewels better tuck up
'Cos I know a lotta fools'll get you stuck up

Don't try to blame me when the Jamie's talking
Boy you kind of bore me 'til you're [?] walking
Before I start pulling out blades and shillelaghs
Puffing on bomb life, sipping on Bailey's

[Everlast] Who's next
[Ryu] One shot is never enough
[Everlast] Who's next
[Ryu] I just drank a whole bottle for lunch
[Everlast] Who's next
[Ryu] Swinging wild but I'm landing 'em flush
[Both] Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched

[Chorus: Ryu]
So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up
So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up
So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up
So get ready to (Move!)
And get fucked up, yeah

[Sample: Marvin Gaye - Stubborn Kind of Fellow]
Wanna love you in
Wanna love you in
Wanna love you in every way
