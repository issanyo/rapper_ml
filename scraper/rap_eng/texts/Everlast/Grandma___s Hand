Grandma's hands clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands played the tambourine so well
Grandma's hands used to issue out a warning
She'd say, "Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
Might be snaked there in that grass, "
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands sooth the local unwed mother
Grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands used to lift her face and tell her
She'd say, "Baby Grandma understands
That you really loved that man
Put yourself in Jesus' hands."
Grandma's Hands
Grandma's hands used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands, boy the really came in handy
She'd say, "Mattie don't you whip that boy
What you want to spank him for?
He didn't drop no apple core,"
But I don't have Grandma anymore
If I get to heaven I'll look for
Grandma's hands
Um, mm, mm
