Who you're trying to get crazy with whitie?
Don't you know I'm loco?
I hear that  train to comin'
It's comin' out  the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
And I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train just keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone..
When I was just a baby my mama told me "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns."
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

There's probably rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' whisky and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin'
And that's what tortures me...

Well if they'd freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I long to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow out my blues away.....
