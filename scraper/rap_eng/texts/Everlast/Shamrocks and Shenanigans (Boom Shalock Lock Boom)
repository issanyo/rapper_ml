[Verse 1: Everlast]
I kicks the flavor, like Stephen King writes horror
If I was a Jew then I'd light a Menorah
I got rhymes for ya, excuse me, Se√±ora
Are you a whore or, are you a lady?
Is it Erica Boyer or Marcia Brady?
Let me know hon, the deed'll get done
Just assume the position, I'll take my rod
And then I'll go fishin', I'll get your river flowin'
I'm always in the knowin'
(When) it comes to givin' pleasure, I'm every woman's treasure
I came to work your body, so let me do my job
I've never been laid off, my rhymin' skill paid off
Cause now I'm makin' records, now I'm makin' tapes
Steady bustin' suckers in bunches like grapes
Makin' all the papes, scoopin' up the loot
Puttin' suckers on the run, pull my gun and then I shoot
I never been a front, I never been a fraud
I got a natural skill, for that I thank the Lord
Cause I feel blessed, I'm casually dressed
I always got my gun, but I never wear a vest
I'm quick on the draw like the horse named McGraw
From the cartoon boom sha lock lock boom

[Chorus]
(boom sha lock lock boom) - all right now
(Boom sha lock lock boom) - a little louder
(Boom sha lock lock boom) - everybody
(Boom sha lock lock boom) - all right now

[Verse 2: Danny Boy]
Breaker, breaker, here comes the caper
Straight with the taper, the lyric skyscraper
Hit ya like a lyrical murderer
I know ya think I have, but yo
I never heard of ya
Just because you heard of me kid
Fuck around with D, you do the lifetime bid
I'll put you in the dirt, and leave your ass for dead
When it comes to tools, D's the sharpest in the shed
Cause I'm the 55 Cadillac king
It ain't no thing, my Claddagh ring
Will bust you in the grill
I got the skill, you gots to chill
Cause I bring doom
I got the boom sha lock lock boom

[Chorus]
(boom sha lock lock boom) - all right now
(Boom sha lock lock boom) - a little louder
(Boom sha lock lock boom) - everybody
(Boom sha lock lock boom) - all right now

[Verse 3: Everlast]
I rock mad styles, I hop turnstiles
I rock all mics, I last all night
I puff fat blunts, I rock fine stunts
Step up bo, I'll knock out your gold fronts
Everlast, that's my name
My unique rhyme style's my claim to fame
The House Of Pain's the name of my clique
You can't be down, punk, get off my dick
You make me sick, like Strawberry Quik
Your style is wack, you ain't the mack
So yo step back, get off the crack
And sing a new tune like boom sha lock lock boom

[Chorus]
(boom sha lock lock boom) - all right now
(Boom sha lock lock boom) - a little louder
(Boom sha lock lock boom) - everybody
(Boom sha lock lock boom) - all right now (x2)
