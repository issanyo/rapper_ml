[Intro: Lil Peep]
Yeah
What, hey
Ooh, yuh, uh

[Chorus: LiL PEEP]
Welcome to the underground, other underground
Pussy never come around, he don't like the sound
Lil Peep, OmenXIII, we hold it down
I can take that smile off your face and make you frown
Evil killer clown, creepin' in the sewer
I be laughing while I'm killing, like I barely even knew her
I'ma cut her up in pieces, leave that bitch inside the swamp
I'm the king over it so everybody knows what's up

[Verse: OmenXIII]
Welcome to the underground, other underground
Where you can't see a thing and you can't hear a sound
Lil Peep, OmenXIII we hold it down
We could take your fuckin' industry and burn it to the ground
Get the gas and light the matches, then we dance around the ashes
Get the message to the masses 'cause we sick of hearing wack shit
'Cause these niggas got no passion, fashion game played out
I just don't give a fuck how you walkin' out the house
OmenXIII, ice when I speak
Flow so cold but I'm comin' with that heat
I'm comin' out my castle, I ain't comin' off the street
Then it's back into the shadows where they cannot seem to see
I feel like I'm asleep, I'm lost in the abyss
I'm hidden in my pain, I'm hidden in the mist
The cops kick with the shit
No I don't need no bitch
No I don't need no fame
No I don't need no clique, bitch

[Chorus: LiL PEEP]
Welcome to the underground, other underground
Pussy never come around, he don't like the sound
Lil Peep, OmenXIII, we hold it down
I can take that smile off your face and make you frown
Evil killer clown, creepin' in the sewer
I be laughing while I'm killing, like I barely even knew her
I'ma cut her up in pieces, leave that bitch inside the swamp
I'm the king over it so everybody knows what's up
