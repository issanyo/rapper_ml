Lyrics From Snippet

Callin, Shawty Callin, Why you call girl?
She can't understand me she a fan girl
Big bands, getting big bands
But it come with a whole lot of bullshit
Tracy keep a full clip
Pull up on your bitch then I flex like I’m made to
Pull up on your block with the squad like I hate you
Work non stop cause the clock don't stop
Goth boi I don't need a Glock my hitta’ will mob you
