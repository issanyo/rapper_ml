[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Now I'm in the clouds with an angel
Baby I got tatted on my halo
I just want a hunnid million pesos
I just wanna lay low, sleeping on a bankroll
Said she wanna fuck me, if you say so
But I ain't forgetting what I came fo'
Gotta a couple shooters in my payroll
Tec in a faygo, neck in a Range Rover
Walking through the flames with my chain on
Gold slugs on my teeth with a cape on
Walking through the flames with my chain on
Gold slugs on my teeth with a cape on

[Verse 2: Air]
Smoking like a rock star
Dress like a pop star, I look like Fish Narc
Imma baller baby, you know my whip push-start
Shake that ass for me, make it stop then start
Smoking like a rock star
Dress like a pop star, I look like Fish Narc
Imma baller baby, you know my whip push-start
Shake that ass for me, make it stop then start
I've been out here catching bans dead presidents
Having sex pull up with a ski mask, bad bitch
Pull up in a foreign (P-p-pull)
Hennessy ain't worth my glow
We in Hollywood with yo hoe
Go to hell, they used to tell me
Welcome to hell, you can't ignore me
Smoking like a rock star
Dress like a pop star, I look like Fish Narc
Imma baller baby, you know my whip push-start
Shake that ass for me, make it stop then start

[Outro]
I'm heaven scent, don't you
Dare forget I'm heaven scent, don't you
Dare forget
