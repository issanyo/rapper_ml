[Intro]
Damn son, where'd you find this?

[Verse]
Screamin' oh my my
That ass so fine
Make a grown man cry (man cry)
If I take my time
And replace my crimes
With a  face recognized (recognized)
We can do anything (anything)
Worth remembering ('membering)
One day I'll be sober too (sober too)
One day I'll be over you (over you)
Screamin' oh my my
That ass so fine
Make a grown man cry (man cry)
If I take my time
And replace my crimes
While I make my rhymes (my rhymes)
I can do anything (anything)
I can be anything (anything)
Anything I wanna be (wanna be)
I can never be a wanna be (wanna be)

[Outro]

Fuck the cops, man they on to me
Baby you were just a pawn to me
Fuck the cops, man they on to me
