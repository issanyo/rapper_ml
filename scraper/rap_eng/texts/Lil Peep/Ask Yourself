[Intro: Lil Peep]
I'm a punk star

[Refrain: Lil Peep]
You don't mind and I don't mind at all, at all
You act kind, I don't act kind at all, at all

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
I ask myself
Why am I talkin' like this?
Ask yourself
Do you deserve this treatment?

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I was out in Belgium on tour
That's the day that I convinced myself that I was truly yours

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
I know that you hear me
I know that you hear me
I know that you're here, girl
I'm at the door
I know that you're here, girl
Answer the door

[Refrain: Lil Peep]
You don't mind and I don't mind at all, at all
You act kind, I don't act kind at all

[Verse 3: Lil Peep]
I, I ask myself
Why am I talkin' like this?
Ask yourself
Do you deserve this treatment?
No one deserves this treatment
No one deserves this treatment
Oooh, you don't deserve this treatment
(You don't deserve this)

[Refrain: Lil Peep]
I know that you hear me
(I know that you hear me)
I know that you hear me
(I know that you hear me)
I know that you hear me, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I was out in Belgium on tour
That's the day that I convinced myself that I was truly yours

[Refrain: Lil Peep]
I know that you hear me
I know that you hear me
Yeah
You don't mind and I don't mind at all, at all
You act kind, I don't act kind at all, at all

[Verse 4: Lil Peep]
I ask myself
Why am I talkin' like this?
Ask yourself
Do you deserve this treatment?
Do you deserve this treatment?
Do you deserve this treatment?
Deserve this treatment
(I know that you hear me)

[Outro: Lil Peep]
I was on my own for the past two months
I haven't seen a friend's face
In too long
On my own
That's why I notice all, all that shit
(All that shit)
All that shit that fucked me up
(Fucked me up)
You act kind, I don't act kind at all, at all
