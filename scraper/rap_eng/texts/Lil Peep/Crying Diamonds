She cryin' diamonds (get me high, get me high, get me high)
I'm cryin' diamonds (that, that, gimme that)
Bitch, I'm shinin' (I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine)
Bitch, I'm dyin' (In my life, in my life, in my life)
She cryin' diamonds (get me high, get me high, get me high)
I'm cryin' diamonds (that, that, gimme that)
Bitch, I'm shinin' (I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine)
Bitch, I'm dyin' (In my life, in my mind)
I'm dyin' (In my mind)

[Verse]
Shawty, I've been off on the shit aye
Shawty, I'm a real piece of shit right
Full cup of lean, now i need about a brick aye
Fall in love me, now she always suckin' dick. right
I just told my bitch, "I'm gettin' money"
Now she actin' funny, she ain't gettin' nothin' from me
I just told my bitch, "I'm gettin' money"
Now she actin' funny, she ain't gettin' nothin' from me

[Chorus]
She cryin' diamonds (get me high, get me high, get me high)
I'm cryin' diamonds (that, that, gimme that)
Bitch, I'm shinin' (I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine)
Bitch, I'm dyin' (In my life, in my life, in my life)

[Outro]
Get me high, get me high, get me high
That, that, gimme that
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
