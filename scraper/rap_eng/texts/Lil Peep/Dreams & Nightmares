[Chorus: Teddy]
It's my fairytale, dreams and nightmares (yeah)
Sippin' on this potion, hope it make me see clear
Baby, fifth pocket pills help me sleep well
Champagne, nightmares, they recount
It's my fairytale, dreams and nightmares
Sippin' on this potion, hope it make me see clear (yeah)
Baby, fifth pocket pills help me sleep well (yeah, yeah)
Champagne, nightmares, they recount

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
I been so patient
But I just can't watch and stand by
Look ma, we made it
Tears fall while she watch the bands fly
My best friends know that I can't lie (yeah)
Her best friends swear I'm a good guy (swear I'm a good guy)
They don't know about my bad side
Nightmares still here from last night

[Chorus: Teddy]
It's my fairytale, dreams and nightmares (yeah)
Sippin' on this potion, hope it make me see clear (see clear)
Baby, fifth pocket pills help me sleep well (sleep well)
Champagne, nightmares, they recount
It's my fairytale, dreams and nightmares
Sippin' on this potion, hope it make me see clear (yeah)
Baby, fifth pocket pills help me sleep well (yeah, yeah)
Champagne, nightmares, they recount (yeah)

[Verse 2: Teddy]
Doctor just said that I need help
Told mama gotta fix these problems, please, I just need help (yeah)
'Cause fifth pocket pills help me sleep well
Need you by my side, baby, you help me sleep well
Pour a four in the cup, help me catch a vibe
Thinkin' 'bout her love lately helps me, get me high
'Cause, baby, fifth pocket pills help me sleep well
Fifth pocket pills help me sleep well (yeah)

[Chorus: Teddy]
It's my fairytale, dreams and nightmares (yeah)
