[Intro]
Fucked up, yeah
Girl, you got me fucked up, yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't gonna lie, I'ma keep it real
I don't wanna tell you how I feel
I just wanna get you to my room
We can do whatever that we wanna do
Rip my shirt, kiss my neck
Throw me on the floor girl, make me sweat
Scratch my back, make me bleed
I could be whatever that you want me to be
I could do whatever that you wanted from me
Want a little blow, I can get it for free
Want a little dough, you can get it for free
Haven't been home in a minute, I've been fucked up

[Hook]
I've been all the way fucked up
Girl, you got me fucked up
One chance and I fucked it up
I was fucked up
Baby, I've been fucked up
Girl, you got me fucked up
One chance and I fucked it up
I was fucked up
Baby, I've been fucked up

[Verse 1]
I ain't gonna lie, I'ma keep it real
I don't wanna tell you how I feel
I just wanna get you to my room
We can do whatever that we wanna do
Rip my shirt, kiss my neck
Throw me on the floor girl, make me sweat
Scratch my back, make me bleed
I could be whatever that you want me to be
I could do whatever that you wanted for me
Want a little blow, I can get it for free
Want a little dough, you can get it for free
Haven't been home in a minute, I've been fucked up

[Hook]
I've been all the way fucked up
Girl, you got me fucked up
One chance and I fucked it up
I was fucked up
Baby, I've been fucked up
Girl, you got me fucked up
One chance and I fucked it up
I was fucked up
Baby, I've been fucked up
