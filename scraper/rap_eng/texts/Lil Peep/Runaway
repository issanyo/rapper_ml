[Intro]
Runaway from here
Everybody so fake
Everybody so fake, I swear
I don't wanna go back there

[Chorus]
Take me, away from here
Everybody so fake
Everybody so fake, I swear
But I don't wanna go back there
Everybody so fake
Everybody act like they care
Take me, away from here
Everybody so fake
Everybody so fake, I swear
But I don't wanna go back there
Everybody so fake
Everybody act like they care
Everybody act like they care
Why the fuck do everybody act like they care?
I was dying and nobody was there
Please don't cry, baby, life ain't fair

[Verse]
I run away from my problems
I do the drugs when I want 'em
I ran away from my momma
Don't bother me with no drama
Now I'm looking for a ghost girl (Ghost girl)
I ain't never gonna find her (Find her)
Pain pills with my coke, girl (Coke, girl)
You know I gotta get high first (High first)
Now I'm looking for a ghost girl
I ain't never gonna find her
You were everything I know, girl
Ain't it funny how life work?
(Ain't it funny how life work?)

[Chorus]
Take me, away from here
Everybody so fake
Everybody so fake, I swear
But I don't wanna go back there
Everybody so fake
Everybody act like they care
Take me, away from here
Everybody so fake
Everybody so fake, I swear
But I don't wanna go back there
Everybody so fake
Everybody act like they care
Everybody act like they care
Why the fuck do everybody act like they care?
I was dying and nobody was there
Please don't cry, baby, life ain't fair

[Outro]
I run away from my problems
I do the drugs when I wanna
I ran away from my momma
Don't bother me with no drama
(I run away from my problems)
(I run away from my problems)
