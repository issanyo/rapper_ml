[Intro]
Love you, Chris

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Baby, how you doing? I know you're not doing the best but I'm here, I'll always be here
Tell me if you need me and call me if you feelin alone 'cause I'm here, I'm always right here
Tell me that I'm dumb, I love to get numb
I know that I'm young but I'm still right here
I don't give a fuck, I love who I love and girl you're that one so I'll wait right here (GothBoiClique)
Baby, how you doing? I know you not doing the best but I'm here, I'll always be here
Tell me if you need me and call me if you feelin alone 'cause I'm here, I'm always right here
Tell me that I'm dumb, I love to get numb
I know that I'm young but I'm still right here
I don't give a fuck, I love who I love and girl you're that one so I'll wait right here

[Verse: HORSE HEAD]
Baby, I'm leaving, I'm not taking anything but you
Picture us escaping, in the background of the photo
I see you, I remember the time
I remember hearts sewn together with twine
Just remember that I am still right here
And if you doubt me that's just fine, and when it comes clear
I will be waiting right here, just tell me if you need me
And I will meet you right there
