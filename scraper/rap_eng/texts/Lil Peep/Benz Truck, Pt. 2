Good luck, mothafucka
From another bitch
Double up my cup and shit
Ooh, Big Head on the beat

[Chorus]
Baby call me up, tryna fuck
'Cause she know, I'm finna get the Benz truck
Good luck, mothafucka
I was in the cut, gettin' sucked from another bitch
Pop another bean, had to double up my cup and shit
Call me up, tryna fuck
'Cause she know that I've been gettin' to the bucks
Good luck, mothafucka
Back of the club, fucked up on some other shit
All I ever wanted was a Benz and a bad bitch

[Verse]
All I ever wanted was a friend
All I ever wanted was a brand new Benz truck
Now I wonder where my friends gon' end up
Money don't help with the pain, where the drugs at?
Make a few racks, call the plug back
She like, "Baby, where you goin'? When you comin' back?"
I'ma be away for a month
When I get back we can fuck
I'ma be away for a lifetime
Everything I say at the right time
Givin' girls cocaine, white wine
Everyone afraid of my lifestyle

[Chorus]
Baby call me up, tryna fuck
'Cause she know, I'm finna get the Benz truck
Good luck, mothafucka
I was in the cut, gettin' sucked from another bitch
Pop another bean, had to double up my cup and shit
Call me up, tryna fuck
'Cause she know that I've been gettin' to the bucks
Good luck, mothafucka
Back of the club, fucked up on some other shit
All I ever wanted was a Benz and a bad bitch
