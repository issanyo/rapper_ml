[Verse]
You know it's fucked when the pain feel nice
Cheap liquor on ice, nice
I'm tryna get you out my head tonight (tonight)
I'm tryna get you out my fuckin' life (fuckin' life, right)
Then we fucked, then she sucked me off twice
Then I left that bitch alone like I was right, fuckin' right (wrong)
In your thong, smokin' strong outta bong
What the fuck, and I'm tryna make this song (hey, hey)
Young white prick, I get a kick out hittin' licks
Watch how I kick out yo bitch, just so I could cut my wrist
Bitch, I'm tatted out my shirt, so I can't work, I make it flip
Pour my 40 in the dirt, then light my dutch and take a sip
I hear voices in my head, they tellin' me to call it quits
I found some Xanax in my bed, I took that shit, went back to sleep
They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm prayin' to the sky, I don't even know why, aye

[Bridge]
Ohhh, I don't think I can take this anymore
Nooo, washing the blood from my wrist on the floor
Ohhh, fuck is you talkin' 'bout? My shit is dope
Play this shit when they put me in a hole
For eternity, so they can reap what they sow
Ohhh, I don't think I can do nothin' but flow
Nooo, I don't know what she be fuckin' me for
Ohhh, I don't know why you in love with me, ho
I keep amphetamines up in my coat
I'm in the zone, I'm all on my own

[Verse]
