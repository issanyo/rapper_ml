[Intro]
Hmm...

[Verse]
Everything hurts
Everything just gets worse
All this ice on me burns (Everything hurts)
Now they nice to me, when they weren't (Ayy)

[Chorus]
I've been flexin' it's my turn
Now I feel like it's my turn
Now I'm makin' it turn
I've been flexin' like it's my turn (Ayy)
I've been flexin' it's my turn (Bitch)
Now I feel like it's my turn (Bitch)
Now I'm makin' it turn
Now they nice to me, when they weren't (Ayy)
I've been flexin' it's my turn
I've been flexin' it's my turn
I keep flexin' it's my turn
I've been flexin' like it's my turn
