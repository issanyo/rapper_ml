[Intro: Lil Peep]
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (As it's falling down)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around (I'm not around)
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town (You're out of town)
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down (It's falling down)

[Bridge: iLoveMakonnen]
Where I wanna be again and again
Alone, you and me, just skin to skin
Where I wanna be again and again
Alone, you and me, skin to skin

[Verse 1: ​iLoveMakonnen]
Why don't we talk the way we should if I'm always on your mind?
What do I have to prove to ya to be your one and only guy?

[Chorus: Lil Peep & ​iLoveMakonnen]
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(As it's falling down, as it's falling down)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
(When I'm not around, when I'm not around)
Shit don't feel the same when you're outta town
(You're out of town)
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(As it's falling down, yeah)

[Bridge: iLoveMakonnen]
Where I wanna be again and again
Alone, you and me, skin to skin

[Verse 2: ​iLoveMakonnen]
I know you want me and you know I feel the same way
Don't wanna leave you, by your side together, here I stay
Let's change the weather, you and I don't ever have to die
We'll be forever, bae, our love is the real thing

[Chorus: Lil Peep & ​iLoveMakonnen]
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(As it's falling! As it's falling down!)
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
(When I'm not a-! When I'm not a-!)
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
(As it's falling!)
