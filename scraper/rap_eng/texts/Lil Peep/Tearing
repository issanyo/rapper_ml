[Chorus: Drippin So Pretty]
Trynna run your mouth around me but I'm not hearing
Is you fucking serious?
Is you fucking kidding?
Smoking on that smoke thinking 'bout my life tearing
I'm smoking on that smoke thinking 'bout my life tearing

Trynna run your mouth around me but I'm not hearing
Is you fucking serious?
Is you fucking kidding?
Smoking on that smoke thinking 'bout my life tearing
I'm smoking on that smoke thinking 'bout my life tearing

[Verse 1: Drippin So Pretty]
I'm not fucking tearing, swear to god I'm not crying
I pull up on yo' bitch, she say she love me but she lyin'
She don't love the kid, she only love the dick
Dick a bitch down bad, round music triple 6
I'm not on the hype
That was in '09
I'm a vet, you a hype
Beast
And you losin' time
Commited crimes as a youngin'
And never thought I'll be something
Fuck around with me, I'mma show yo bitch what's up
Tell her she don't need your comfort
Just my dick all in her gut (true)
Yeah, I'm a flexer
Counting the numbers just like Dexter
Calling on the throw away
My hook, his name is Hector
Calling on the throw away
My hook, his name is Hector

[Chorus: Drippin So Pretty]
Trynna run your mouth around me but I'm not hearing
Is you fucking serious?
Is you fucking kidding?
Smoking on that smoke thinking 'bout my life tearing
I'm smoking on that smoke thinking 'bout my life tearing

You're trynna run your mouth around me but I'm not hearing
Is you fucking serious?
Is you fucking kidding?
Smoking on that smoke thinking 'bout my life tearing
I'm smoking on that smoke thinking 'bout my life tearing

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
(Yeah)
I'm smoking on that smoke thinking 'bout my life
I ain't smoking dope, then I'm on that white (white, white)
I could use a rope, I could use a knife
She said "cut my throat", now she O.J. wife
(hah-u)
Bitch I got a quote, what you need? (what you need?)
You can see thru the smoke of gasoline (that gasoline)
I got everything you want, is in my jeans (is in my jeans)
Gettin' money but I still eat Mickey D's
They like "where the fuck you're going Lil Peep?" (Where you going?)
Bitch, I'm swerving thru the jungle with a Jeep (Skrrrt)
When I say I'm in the jungle I'm the streets (streets, treets)
When I say you got a hustle I swear I mean

[Outro: Lil Peep]
Bitch
What the fuck you lookin' at?
Bitch
What the fuck you lookin' at?
Bitch
What the fuck you lookin' at?
(hey)
