[Intro: NEDARB]
I just want some commas, I don't really want'cha
I just want some commas, I don't really want'cha
I just want some commas, I don't really want'cha
I just want some commas, I don't really want'cha

[Verse 1: NEDARB]
Rolling, I'm zoning, I forget the past
Only here to collect bands on that cash
Focus on me and team got my back
Rolling so deep cause we got it like that
Backstage shawty running up me a tab
Checkered with the painting, till I get another chance
Everybody know that we don't know about that
I'm riding through the city, got the green up in the back
Curbing these bitches so early
I don't love hoes, she don't hear me
Why all my haters they fear me?
Cause they know they cannot be me
Little last four, you should know that
Big time a classic like a throwback
You talk to lil' hoes where your hoes at
You're the only hoe that I know jack

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
No, I do not give a fuck they think
No, I do not give a fuck what they say
I'm dropping downers inside of my drink
I'm popping uppers, I can't go to bed
Lil Peep shawty, I'm a skinny little bitch
Eight rings on me now I'm looking like a prince
Eight things on me now I'm looking like Kim
Ice drop down from the clouds, don't slip bitch
Bust my nut, let her bust my lip
All of my demons they heard me
I hear the spirits so clearly
Baby girl know she deserve me
They don't compare to me dearly
Lil' ass boy you should know that
Schema the posse, I show that
I hate my life, I can't go back
I take the Xans with the Prozac
