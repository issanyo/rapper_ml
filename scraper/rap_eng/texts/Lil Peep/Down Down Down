[Verse: Lil Peep]
We can have sex, chill out, smoke a sac
Try to understand that yo new man wack, he a sad
Make you drip drip down from a bad (from a bad)
She can take dick like she fat (like she fat)
You've been riding 'round on flats (on flats)
I can tell by the way you write yo raps (write yo raps)
Snakes don't come around, facts (real facts)
Nigga trapped to the lies and the racks (racks)
If you keep it real, I keep it real back (back)
I keep it real back, so she on my back (ohh)
Drinking that yack, smoking a sack (a sack)
I put yo town in the map, gimme some that (gimme that bitch)
