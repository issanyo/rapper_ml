[Chorus: YungGoth]
Catch me in the stairway, aye, aye
Catch me in the, yeah, catch me in the, aye
Catch me in the stairway, aye, aye
Right before this fishscale, aye, aye
Catch me, you're a freezer mane, aye, aye
And you're crazy callin' us freaks, aye, aye, aye
[?], aye, aye
[?], aye, aye
I'm just sittin' in the hallway
I'm just sittin' in the hallway
I'm just sittin' in the hallway
I'm just sittin' in the hallway

[Verse: Lil Peep]
Wipe off all that fishscale
When they get me, won't you pay my bills
Bitch, I get it in the fuckin' mail
Like my bitches thick, but I'm so frail
If I counted all the blunts I smoked
If I counted all the hearts I broke
If you've doubted I'ma make you choke
On your word for free
I ain't come with a fee, not me, not me
Catch me in the stairway
I'm on that I don't fuckin' care way
It's like three up in my time zone
It's like three up in my styrofoam
