[Verse 1: ATOMS]
[?]
Just like this
Ski mask on my face
When I come sliding
To the [?]
[?]
Every night I'm in the jungle
[?]
Getting high with my brother Lil Peep
Getting high with me
[?]
Quietly, I smoke silently
[?]
I slowly make history
[?]
I am the answer
[?]
I am the cancer

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
I put my heart in this shit
I ripped the heart out the goat
Pull the blade out my coat
Cut your throat to the bone
On some Game of Thrones shit
I cannot fuck with no bitch
When she suckin' on somebody dick
That type of shit get me sick
I'm a prick but I don't fuck with bitches
That get my whole city whatever they want
If it's pussy, a lip on the tip of the dick
All of you wannabe rappers became an illusion to make that shit happen
And that's probably cause you just rap about trappin
Or smackin the next motherfucker that say that I act like I'm ____

All of y'all pussies is wack, some of y'all pussies is rats
Half of y'all pussies is trash and the other half of y'all is dying at night what the fuck do that mean do the math
Step on the scene like the hulk bitch I'm green
Bitches on me I'm the young Charlie Sheen
Rips in my jeans and my skin til I bleed
The reason you're losing your sleep is Lil Peep
