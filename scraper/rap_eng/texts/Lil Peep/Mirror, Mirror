[Verse]
I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall
Money gettin' tall and tall and tall
I know I'mma ball, mirror on the wall
I could make it all and all and all
I ain't pickin' up a call, mirror on the wall

[Outro]
I could take it all and all and all
Mirror on the wall, mirror on the wall
I could make her fall and fall and fall
Spirits in the hall, mirror on the wall
