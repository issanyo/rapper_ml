[Verse 1: LiL PEEP]
Living like I got a deathwish (Living like I got a deathwish)
Blood on my necklace (Blood on my necklace)
Show me respect, bitch (Show me respect, bitch)
Give me your neck, bitch (Give me your neck, bitch)
She on my checklist (She on my checklist)
Order my next bitch (Order my next bitch)
Fucking my ex-bitch (Fucking my ex-bitch)
I'm feeling reckless (I'm feeling reckless)
Give me a problem I'ma put that inside of my bottle when I drink it up
Schema the posse
You fucking with legends
You playing yourself if you don't give it up
Stashing my dope in the back of the bus
Go get the money then give out the cus
Kamikaze if you run up on us
Keep the bodies in the trunk
Aye, uh

[Verese 2: GHOSTEMANE]
[?] take all of my shit
See without seeing and then when I see it come as a diss
Under the sea [?] the demon within
I did the best to your [?] and you'll be lying in a ditch
I am the one that bring light [?] to my soul
You are the one that bring ignorance [?] that you go
Do as [?] wish but don't [?]
Schema the clique [?] show

[Verse 3: JGRXXN]
Damn, I am who I am and that's the wrong [?] God
Yo well being, I will pull apart the flesh
I bring carnage
Bloodstains under-weigh the pain in your garments
Nigga, back, back
Hear the clap, clap
Take that nap, nap
Hear the crack, crack
When I swing the bat
You must want your deathwish
You can catch the iss'
See these hands blister
Watch your hips twist
