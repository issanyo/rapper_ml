[Verse 1: Pollári]
You look like a girl from the magazine
Movie screen come with me
I'll keep you company
Take a seat, all this lean
It feel like a dream
Every time you call on me
I'll be your fantasy
You look like a girl from the magazine
Movie screen come with me
I'll keep you company
Take a seat, all this lean
It feel like a dream
Every time you call on me
I'll be your fantasy

[Bridge: Pollári]
I be off a bean (I be off a bean)

[Hook: Lil Peep]
I been up all night while I take a bean
Last night you say you saw me in a vivid dream
Tell me baby look at me and what is it you see?
Tell me baby is it him or is it me?
I been up all night while I take a bean
Last night you say you saw me in a vivid dream
Tell me baby look at me and what is it you see?
I been up all night rolling off a bean

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Got love in my gun
Back of the club
I don't talk much, aye
Love in my gun
Back of the club
I don't talk much
I don't wanna talk to you
I don't wanna talk to you

[Hook: Lil Peep]
I been up all night while I take a bean
Last night you say you saw me in a vivid dream
Tell me baby look at me and what is it you see?
Tell me baby is it him or is it me?
I been up all night while I take a bean
Last night you say you saw me in a vivid dream
Tell me baby look at me and what is it you see?
I been up all night rolling off a bean

[Outro: Lil Peep]
Got love in my gun
Back of the club
I don't talk much
Aye
