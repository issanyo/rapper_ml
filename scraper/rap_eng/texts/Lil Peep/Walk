[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Talk, walk, walk, talk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Talk, talk, walk, talk, walk, talk
Walk, walk, walk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
I got lots of drug dealers
I be gettin' in my feelings
I got problems with the women
Tell them hoes I ain't perfect

[Verse 2: Yung Goth]
I don't really know how to live in the street
I be dyin' everyday, tryna keep it all discrete
Fuckin' up my life, I don't really give a shit
Poppin' pills in my room, I can count on counterfeit
I don't really give a fuck about the lies in my room
I don't give a fuck and found no body in the room
I'll shoot 'em down anyway, bitches can't consume
All this swag up in my pocket
'Cause you know you lose your cool

[Bridge: ITSOKTOCRY]
Free drugs
Free drugs
Free drugs
Free drugs
Free drugs
Free drugs
Free drugs
Free drugs

[Verse 3: ITSOKTOCRY]
When I pull up with your bitch
Don't give a fuck if you're rich
Don't give a fuck bitch, I'm lit
Diggin' my dick in her ribs
Kissin' her clit with my lips
I kill the pussy, no shit
I kill the pussy and dip
Skeet, skeet with the jets
Beat up, beat up on the pussy
Homie, what the fuck you lookin'
I got your bitch and she cookin'
Suckin' my dick like a rookie
Derek Jeter, I'm a rookie
Tell 'em we makin' a movie
I'm finna buss on her boobies
Drugs on me, I'm a junkie

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Talk, walk, walk, talk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Talk, talk, walk, talk, walk, talk
Walk, walk, walk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
