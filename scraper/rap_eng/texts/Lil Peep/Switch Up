[Verse]
I had everybody hatin' on me on last year
Baby, that was last year..
Now I'm blowin' past yeah
Whole squad wit me smokin' on dat gas yea
Pass that over here, bitch, I'm tryna disappear (poof)
I'm a ghost in my city in your city, I'm the most loved
All the young bitches fuckin' with me (damn)

[Hook]
I could never switch up on my brothers (nah)
I put that on my mother
I could never switch up on my brothers
I put that on my mother
I could never switch up on my brothers
I put that on my mother
I could never switch up on my brothers
I put that on my mother, know I love her
