[Verse 1: Lil Peep]

Now I'm one step closer to hell
I can feel the cold sweat comin' on
Pretty bitches wanna fuck me and tell
Same bitches that was hatin' on my first song
Now they say they want to fuck me with my jays on
Drugs gone, probably 'cause, me and pain, took 'em off
Nobody told you i got tears on my shirt
Blame me self if you ever get hurt, somebody kill
Drugged out, plug house, try to cop another fix
Fans all up on my dick, but they don't know my government
There till I'm fuckin' rich
Lil peep, lil pain, tell 'em hoes, suck a dick
Brokeboy sad as shit, i don't really give a shit
Sellin' reggie by the brick
Acid couldn't make me trip
They mad, they couldn't make me flip
Hit a bitch, hit a dip, nineties baby, gettin' lit
Bang, Bang, hit a lick, liquid got me ignorant

[Verse 1: Lil Pain]

I'm Reggie Bush, Reggie Miller, Reggie Jackson
In my hood they call me reggie
Coz' the reggie's what I'm packin'
Sippin', trippin', trickin', smokin', thinkin', shit that you can fathom
All these tips keep overflowin', told lil peep to pass a napkin
I'm lookin' in the mirror, starin at a distant stranger
I see pain, i see sorrow, i see her, i see anger
Put the barrel to my head
And this one shot in the chamber
Now my eyes are bloody red
That means all i see is danger
There's a bitch inside my bed
She ain't [?], i won't blame her
She keep cryin', i keep lyin' but the truth is i won't save her
So now she hates me but thats fine, because i hate my self
The truth is I'm tryin' to save my self
Peep waddup
