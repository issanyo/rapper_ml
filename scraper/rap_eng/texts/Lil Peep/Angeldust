[Verse]
I'ma take my time when I'm in it
(I'ma take my time when I'm in it)
I'ma make my mind up by tonight
(I'ma make my mind up by tonight)
No, I can't die when I'm singin'
(No, I really can't die when I'm singin')
I could live forever, wait past the mic
(I could live forever, wait past the mic)

[Hook]
These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passin' by, no one noticed my angel wings
Gettin' high 'cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why I might sing you a symphony
These eyes have seen the strangest things
Passin' by, no one noticed my angel wings
Gettin' high 'cause my life don't mean shit to me
Ask me why I might sing you a symphony

[Outro]
"Look at me Damien
It's all for you"
