[Intro: Lil Peep]
I'ma take my last breath in this room
Pills got me up
Real high, like the moon
I been workin' hard
I'ma blow up, real soon
I'ma smoke this strong, while I'm thinkin' 'bout you

[Verse 1: Boy Froot]
I always dream of you
Every time I sleep, I see right through
My intentions have shown
Girl, one day we will glow
Every little single thing you said'll be known
I always can tell, when somethin's on your mind
We're both goin' to hell
But, at least we got time
Look forward to seein', draw back the
Curtains and blinds
I know that I'm hurtin'
But, girl will you be mine?

[Interlude: Boy Froot]
I wanna give it all to you
I wanna give it all to you

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Body on the asphalt
Be careful what you ask for
She think I'm an asshole
What if I end my life though
She'll like me then
I just wanna grab my knife, oh
It's my only friend
Sacrifice my whole life tonight
I'm a lonely man...
