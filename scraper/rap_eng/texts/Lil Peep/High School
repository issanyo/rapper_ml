[Intro]
Haardtek

[Chorus]
Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke?
Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Satan waitin' at the gate for me
I heard this bitch bump Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasin' bitches, I was chasin' dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Lookin' up at 'em like I never even knew 'em at all
I remember walkin' around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I took something that I couldn't recall
Makin' you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself, but I'm already in hell for it

[Verse]
You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You wouldn't wait (skrrt)

[Chorus]
Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke, this lost in the smoke?
Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go, tell heaven don't wait for me
Satan waitin' at the gate for me
I heard this bitch bump Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasin' bitches, I was chasin' dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Lookin' up at 'em like I never even knew 'em at all
I remember walkin' around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I took something that I couldn't recall
Making you cry the way she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself, but I'm already in hell for it
