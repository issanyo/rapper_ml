[Intro: BOY FROOT]
BOY FROOT, BOY FROOT
Yeah, Lil Peep, Lil Peep, bitch
Yeah

[Chorus: BOY FROOT]
300 glo shit, don't text my phone, bitch
I'm just tryna smoke, finna cop me an O quick
300 glo shit, don't text my phone, bitch
I'm just tryna smoke, finna cop me an O quick
I'm finna cop me an O right quick

[Verse 1: BOY FROOT]
I'ma pull up to the plug's, I'm a thug, body in a rug
In my trunk while it bump, bitch, I got designer drugs
I'm up with Lil Peep, we out on the creep
Bitch it's BOY FROOT, I know where you sleep
If your girl's cute, take her back to my crib
I ain't gon' shoot, but I still kill you, snitch
I got the switch, in my right fist
Glow like a light and I'm stealin' your bitch
I got no feelings, I can't feel nothin'
High as the ceilin', I don't know where I am
High as the ceilin', I don't know where I am
High as the ceilin', I don't know where I am

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
I'm high as the ceilin', don't know where I am
Jump off a buildin', I'll fly if I can
She said I always get high if I can
I said I like you, can I be your friend?
And she told me I'm glowin'
She told me I'm blowin' like I didn't know it already
She fuck with me heavy
She think I'm a poet, I think she a stripper
But fuck it, we makin' that fetti
I do what they wouldn't let me
[?]
What should I do if they get me?
Pull out my strap and go out like they do in the movies
I'm shootin' at jakes, shoot your bitch right in the face
Sprayin' your bitch 'til she spray
I want the money today
I keep it real while you fake
That's why I'm great

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
Leave me alone, bitch
I'm just tryna smoke quick
Back of the club goin' up with your ho shit
Get that fuckin' ho shit
Out my fuckin' zone, bitch
I'm Lil Peep, that's BOY FROOT
You a fuckin' clone, bitch

[Chorus: BOY FROOT]
300 glo shit, don't text my phone, bitch
I'm just tryna smoke, finna cop me an O quick
300 glo shit, don't text my phone, bitch
I'm just tryna smoke, finna cop me an O quick
300 glo shit, don't text my phone, bitch
I'm just tryna smoke, finna cop me an O quick
300 glo shit, don't text my phone, bitch
I'm just tryna smoke, finna cop me an O quick
