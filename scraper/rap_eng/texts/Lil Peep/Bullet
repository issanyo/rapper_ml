[Hook: Lil Peep]
Everything here is dead
Its easier to see when its night
I just heard a voice in my head
It asked me if im gon' be alright

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Everything here is dead
It's easier to see when its night
I just heard a voice in my head
It asked me if I'm gon' be alright
Leave me in the back of your head
Yeah you know I'm talking to you
Not too long ago
I probably would have died for you
Everything here is dead
It's easier to see when its night
I just heard a voice in my head
It asked me if I'm gon' be alright
Leave me in the back of your head
Yeah you know im talking to you
Not too long ago
I probably would have died for you

[Verse 1: Airairair]
I had to get in
I get up for this
I hit it and then
You know it
Who left that door open
Cause the windows and door, you original sin
[?]
Tryin to hop in the Benz'
Used to do childish stuff
This is just the beginning
You gotta be [?] for the whole team
Thought you special, you a lame
Now I wanna cry, but I'm with cry baby
Fuck with my emotions
You can get the fuck
I flexed up
With the best love
You was only good for a quick fuck
Bust a couple nuts now I gotta run
Cooling off, you like the barrel at the end of my gun
Point it to my temple, I'm done
Oh, this tempo and your girl got me sprung
My house is cramped
Want a dead president
Fuck the sentiment
I'ma put the bullet to the back of my head

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Everything here is dead
It's easier to see when its night
I just heard a voice in my head
It asked me if I'm gon' be alright
Leave me in the back of your head
Yeah you know im talking to you
Not too long ago
I probably would have died for you
