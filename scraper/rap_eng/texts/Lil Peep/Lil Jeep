[Verse]
I remember when you used to hold my hand
Now you actin' like a ghost, girl
Live forever with a smile stuck on your face
You think he know you, but I know you the most, girl
You will never find another one just like me
Long nights, gettin' high on the coast, girl
Two weeks and I still got the same old jeans on
Never got a girl when I need one

[Chorus]
I see your face when I look out the window
I think about her every time that I sniff blow
If you love me, hit me up on the flip phone
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know

[Post-Chorus]
I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dyin', yeah, yeah

[Verse]
I remember when you used to hold my hand
Now you actin' like a ghost, girl
Live forever with a smile stuck on your face
You think he know you, but I know you the most, girl
You will never find another one just like me
Long nights, gettin' high on the coast, girl
Two weeks and I still got the same old jeans on
Never got a girl when I need one

[Chorus]
I see your face when I look out the window
I think about her every time that I sniff blow
If you love me, hit me up on the flip phone
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know

[Post-Chorus]
I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dyin', yeah, yeah
