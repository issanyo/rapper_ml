[Intro]
I miss you so much, man
I just want to go and join you, man
It's so fuckin' lonely down here
Everything feels so different
I'ma see you soon, bro
I promise

[Verse]
Aye, Peep
Everyone you warned me about, now claimin' they miss you
Held your cold face, said "goodbye", hugged you, then kissed you
Hopped up off that tour bus, stumblin' in pieces
Hope you finally at peace, now that you no longer breathin'
When you was laughin' the hardest, still felt your pain
That deep desperation gaze, cry baby face
You had had a thousand plays way back in the day
When you had them millions, you was still exactly the same
Both fucked up, livin' rough, had nothin'
Edited your first video, you sent my PayPal money
Didn't even want it, but it stopped my sister bein' hungry
We was so connected, livin' in completely different countries
Flew out to LA, Uber to your place
Never seen so many strangers crowded in a tiny place
Everyone offerin' drugs, takin' pictures of your face
No one offerin' love or wonderin' 'bout your day
Both heartbroken, introverted, so lonely
You was the only one of the few to ever really know me
Gus, what's it like up there, man? I wanna join ya
Strugglin' to keep it movin', tangled in paranoia
Everyone that wasn't loyal to ya, woulda killed 'em for ya
You had the same mentality 'cause family important
Gus, I'm tryna fight my fears, our childhood was poison
I got demons I been runnin' from, never stood up and fought 'em
'Bout to take a flight back to London, yeah, in a few days
Where we lived together, I don't wanna see that place
All that bizzare furniture you purchased, so awkwardly placed
You'd take a step back and stare at it until it looked okay
I held your face, took a step back, nothin' looked okay, brother
You was shinin' bright, now you've turned into this grey color
Holdin' back the tears every time I hear your name come up
I don't wanna say nothin', they don't know this pain's cuttin'
Tryna stay strong for loners like us
Made a video of you sleepin' on the back of that bus
Made a joke, said that Gus is workin' out finally
Put the camera on you to see that you was fallin' asleep
Everyday of that tour, like you usually do
Head back, mouth open, yep, the usual
I saw you like this everyday on the entire tour
I didn't know that you was dead, man, as if I would've recorded
