[Intro]
Taylor bout to fucking flex

[Hook]
As of lately I've been feeling down
Getting money and i'm working on my sound
Now I got fans all over my town
Give me the crown, yea, I want the crown, aye
As of lately I've been feeling down
Getting money and i'm working on my sound
Now I got fans all over my town
Give me the crown, yea, I want the crown, aye

[Verse]
Hand me the crown, I deserve It now, multi genre artist, y'all all know what i'm about, aye-yea
Provin haters wrong has always been my speciality
I'ma die young an my only wish is that you'll all remember me
First i'm happy then i'm sad, I got a shawty an she bad
Playin this game with no lag, an that's crazy no cap
Switchin lanes off the rip, R.I.P we getting rich
SBC on the wrist, freshmen we on the list

[Bridge]
Crazy how a dollar can make a friend change
Crazy how I holler so I can have my end's made
Crazy how you see you was always around
But you weren't when I wasn't poppin like I am now

[Interlude: Lil Peep interview sample]
You know, I don't know
You could-you could just wake up again
I have no idea
I'm not-i'm not like...I know there's something
Because you can't kill energy you know what I mean like
Energy doesn't die

[Hook]
As of lately I've been feeling down
Getting money and i'm working on my sound
Now I got fans all over my town
Give me the crown, yea, I want the crown, aye
As of lately I've been feeling down
Getting money and i'm working on my sound
Now I got fans all over my town
Give me the crown, yea, I want the crown, aye

[Verse]
Hand me the crown, I deserve It now, multi genre artist, yall all know what i'm about, aye-yea
Provin haters wrong has always been my speciality
