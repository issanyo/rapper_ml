[Hook]
She makes the boys stare at her legs
It's not that I don't care, I swear you're all in my head
Playing with your hair, laying in my bed
I got some drugs on the nightstand, I feel dead

[Post-Hook]
I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me too
I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me

[Verse]
Baby, it's no fair, girl, I'm a mess
If you drive by, I want you to stop there and give me a kiss
I remember your blonde hair
I remember your black hair
I remember your red hair from last fall
I canâ€™t forget about anything at all

[Hook]
She makes the boys stare at her legs
It's not that I don't care, I swear you're all in my head
Playing with your hair, laying in my bed
I got some drugs on the nightstand, I feel dead

[Post-Hook]
I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me too
I know you're praying for me
I hope you wait for me
