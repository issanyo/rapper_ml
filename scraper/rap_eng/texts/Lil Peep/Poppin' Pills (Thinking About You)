[Chorus]
Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So, I'm gettin' high all week without you
Poppin' pills, thinkin' about you (thinkin' about you)
Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So, I'm gettin' high all week without you
Poppin' pills, thinkin' about you

[Bridge]
I wish I didn't have a heart to love you
(I wish I didn't have a heart to love you)
I wish I didn't play a part to break you
(I wish I didn't play a part to break you)
I wish I didn't do a lot of the shit I do
(The shit I do)
And I wish you didn't too

[Verse]
Tell me that you hate me
I just wanna hear that baby
You could blame me, but you
Love me and we could never lose
That

[Chorus]
Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So, I'm gettin' high all week without you
Poppin' pills, thinkin' about you (thinkin' about you)
Runnin' away from you takes time and pain
And I don't even want to
So, I'm gettin' high all week without you
Poppin' pills, thinkin' about you

[Outro]
Poppin' pills thinking about you
Poppin' pills thinking about you
Poppin' pills, poppin' pills
Pill to pill, pill to pill
