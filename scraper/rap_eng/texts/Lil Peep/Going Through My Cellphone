[Intro: LiL PEEP]
(I'm a punkstar, bitch, I feel like Fish Narc)
She say why the fuck you going through my cellphone

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
Pocket full of xan, percocets and rubber bands
GothBoiClique tatted on my hand
GothBoiClique, you don't understand
I seen a lot of shit, we been through a lot of shit
Pocket full of xan, percocets and rubber bands
GothBoiClique tatted on my hand
GothBoiClique, you don't understand
I seen a lot of shit, we been through a lot of shit

[Verse 1: LiL PEEP]
Why the fuck you going through my cellphone
Why the fuck you going through my cellphone
Through my cellphone
Why the fuck you going through my cellphone

[Verse 2: Mackned]
You know I'm a dirtbag, so let me go
I wish you loved me like the dope (yah)
I wish I had more time to cope (yah)
Why do I feel alone at a sold out show
I hate my cellphone, please don't let me pick it up
Gothboiclique is the reason I get up
And girl it's hard to love you sober
Gosh darn, fuck me when the club's over
Yeah, fuck me when the door is closed
You said enough to let the whole clique wanna die
Yah, yah, fuck me with the door's closed
You said enough to let the whole clique run there
Fuck me to my first track
Baby fuck me 'till I'm over

[Bridge: LiL PEEP]
Baby fuck me to my first track
Fuck me 'till I'm over there

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
Pocket full of xan, percocets and rubber bands
GothBoiClique tatted on my hand
Gothboiclique, you don't understand
I seen a lot of shit, we been through a lot of shit
Pocket full of xan, percocets and rubber bands
GothBoiClique tatted on my hand
Gothboiclique, you don't understand
I seen a lot of shit, we been through a lot of shit

[Verse 3: SneakGuapo]
You been on my mind, rose petals for you
Don't hide, I know that you want it
You'll always be my shawty
Take a shot for you, I know I'll probably regret it
[?] tryin' hard to forget it
State to state tryin' to find a way
Fell deep in love
It's my hideaway
Stuck on you like a flight delay
Show you love like you never had (yeah)
Deep down inside you see my heart's cracked
I'm alone, yeah, I'm alone

[Outro]
I'm a popstar bitch I feel like Fish Narc
