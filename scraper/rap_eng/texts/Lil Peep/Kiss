[Intro]
Spoken words were meant to last, but the picture faded fast
The words "I love you" meant so much, now not even your lips can I touch
I'll cry for another eyesore and think about our first kiss by the tree And how it meant so much to me

[Verse 1]
Nobody knows the me that you do
Gonna take some getting used to
And I think I'm getting through to you
But, all that shit I put you through ain't right
And I know that I'm barely ever home
But, I think of you on the road
You know I think of you on blow
It's me, Lil Jeep, she don't keep not a memory of me
I'm a creep, I'm a freak
That's why nobody's friends with me
I used to wait in my room for a single sign from you
Said "I hate you", 'cause I knew that you would never love me too

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
Ya got one more chance at a night like this...

[Hook]
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick

[Verse 2]
And that's real shit (real), we keep it real, bitch (real)
I'm a goth boy, kinda like my whole clique
You a bad one (true), we should have fun
Let's fuck in the all black Benz truck (skrrr skrr)
Six racks on (Peep), six packs gone (sheesh)
I'm a bad boy, we ain't gonna last long (nah)
I could make you (damn), I could break you (yeah)
Baby, think of all the places I can take you

[Bridge]
What's your age, boo? I'm a jit still
I'ma die young, I'ma get killed
What's your age, boo? I'm a jit still
I'ma die young, baby, I'ma get killed, aye

[Hook]
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
Ya got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
