[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I don't wanna die alone right now, but I admit I do sometimes
These drugs are callin' me, do one more line, don't fall asleep
This is the song they played when I crashed into the wall
This is the girl I told that we could have it all

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
This is the life I made and I can't go back to fall
Back to fall, back to everyone I ever knew at all
Back to small town blues, and not a clue of what's goin' on
Back to old routines, and wedding rings and livin' at the mall, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I don't wanna die alone right now, but I admit I do sometimes
These drugs are callin' me, do one more line, don't fall asleep
This is the song they played when I crashed into the wall
This is the girl I told that we could have it all

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
Baby, I'm a drug, you're addicted to my love
I thought you were the one, but you were just another one
Call me Hellboy, I got fire in my blunt
Don't call me emo, don't call me punk
I'm a vampire, bitch, I'm countin' money up
I'm with Lil Peep, yeah, we hotter than the sun
You should tell your boyfriend stop tryna be like us
Tatted on my face, baby, I don't give a fuck

[Outro: Lil Peep]
I don't wanna die alone right now, but I admit I do sometimes
These drugs are callin' me, do one more line, don't fall asleep
