[Intro]
DJ Smokey

[Hook: Lil Peep]
I do a lot of drugs and I hate it
But I love it, dope got me famous
Screaming fuck fame, go get some money
Screaming fuck lames, I'm one hunnit
I do a lot of drugs and I hate it
But I love it, dope got me famous
Screaming fuck fame, go get some money
Fuck lames, I got my brothers
I do a lot of drugs and I hate it
But I love it, coke got me famous
Screaming fuck fame, go get some money
Fuck lames, keep it one hunnit

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
I ain't talking Tyra Banks, but my bitch is a model
Pussy pop like a bottle and it's wet like Moscato
I do a lot of drugs and I hate it
But I love it, bitch I'm high as fuck in public
Step in the club with Lil Peep, these bitches love it
Cameras flashing, lights camera action
Fuck fame, I want hundreds
Finna get rich and ima spend it how I wanna (on my momma)
You don't really know me
All you know bout me is that people know me
You don't really know me
All you know bout me is that people know me

[Hook]
I do a lot of drugs and I hate it

I do a lot of drugs and I hate it
But I love it, dope got me famous
Screaming fuck fame, go get some money
Fuck lames, I got my brothers
I do a lot of drugs and I hate it
But I love it, coke got me famous
Screaming fuck fame, go get some money
Fuck lames, keep it one hunnit
