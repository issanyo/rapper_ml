[Intro]
Charlie Shuffler

Cocaine in your bitch brain
I've been high since last Friday
I make it rain where my bitch say
No pain when my mind fade
Cold chain
Switchin' lanes, bumpin' Gucci Mane

[Chorus]
Cocaine in your bitch brain
I make it rain where my bitch say
No pain when my mind fade
I've been high since last Friday
Dope veins, wear the cold chain
Switchin' lanes, bumpin' Gucci Mane
I don't listen what my friends say
I can't cry, but I'm a Crybaby
I can't lie, I might die, baby
But as long as I'm alive, we gon' shine, baby
Look me in my eyes, baby
I've been high since last Friday

[Verse]
I can't drive, but let's ride baby
And as long as I'm alive, I'mma die, baby
Time flies on the highway
I've been high since last Friday

[Chorus]
Cocaine in your bitch brain
I make it rain where my bitch say
No pain when my mind fade
I've been high since last Friday
Dope veins, wear the cold chain
Switchin' lanes, bumpin' Gucci Mane
I don't listen what my friends say
I can't cry, but I'm a Crybaby
I can't lie, I might die, baby
But as long as I'm alive, we gon' shine, baby
Look me in my eyes, baby
I've been high since last Friday
