[Verse 1: Ghostemane]
I been workin' hard all the day long
Schemin' on a way to my dreams, I'm
Droppin' everything just to get lost
In another state got my plane booked
I miss everything I can't lie, no
But I ain't goin' back I can't lie no
Keep on holdin' on and you gon die young
Buddha say that its the only way now
Schemaposse bitch we poppin' up now
All that shit you talked it don't mean nun now
Ima underdog I already know
But I'ma about to eat up all the big dogs
Find me in the back of a nightclub
Wishin I could leave but I didn't drive
Wanna be at home with my PS4
Time to bite the bullet once again now

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Blood coming down like a waterfall
Thinking all the days when I had it all
Still see your face when the rainfall
You're the only way to turn my pain on
Blood coming down like a waterfall
Thinking all the days when I had it all
Still see your face when the rainfall
You're the only way to turn my pain on
I don't wanna die, not today nah
I can tell you lying your face off
All this time, just tryna find my place I
Got lost somewhere in outer space
Blood coming down like a waterfall
Thinking all the days when I had it all
Still see your face when the rainfall
You're the only way to turn my pain on
I don't wanna die, not today nah
I can tell you lying your face off
All this time, just tryna find my place I
Got lost somewhere in outer space
