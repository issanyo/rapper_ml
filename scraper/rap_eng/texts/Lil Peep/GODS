[Verse: Lil Tracy & Lil Peep]
I ain’t talking religion baby, but I’m a God
Louboutins on my feet but I ain't got no job
I got hoes on me, call me Lil Tracy Minaj
Call up Lil Tracy up like we finna get to this guap
Skrt skrt down the block baby, I can't stop
Drivin' fast gettin' top watchin' for the cops
Bet your girl know lil peep and lil tracy, we hot
Bet your girl know lil peep and lil tracy, we rock
Your mama tell me that I'm pretty, I get that a lot
He be actin' like he real, but it's just a mirage
She asked me if I wanna die, all I said was yeah
Yah, all I said was yeaaah
Now she all up on my dick when the music drop
Hit the mall, fill my pockets up it then I shop
And I need a fat stack, I can't fuck with knots
Bitches run around the lobby, sleepin' at the top
Back in the day, me and squad, we was juggin' raw
Now we pull up to the mall, we look and we cop
Now they treat me like a star, I act like I'm not
Wanna give me a massage in my new garage
