[Verse 1: Craig Xen]
I remember I was fifteen
Pocket full of lint, with a vision of myself up on the big screen, uh
Big dreams
For a nigga brought up around Pimps, thugs, and limpin' dope fiends, uh
More green, what I needed to get
Trapped between pimpin' pins
Daddy serving them bricks
I made a wise choice, decision I made
Made me into the man that I am today, so peep game
Say bitch you can't break me, bitch you can't break me
They know they can't break me, can't break me

[Verse 2: Craig Xen]
Shout out to my niggas that kept left, I turned right
Hold it down baby, we'll kick it up in the next life, I
Really wish my niggas would've listened
When they told us there's two ways out and ones prison
Such precision within that statement
Listen to the game I'm giving you, cause mane it's sacred
Past, you can't change it mane make them changes today my nigga
Before it's too late, some days I feel it's too much up on my plate
But then again it's the price that a nigga got to pay to make it
Word to J, maintain through the pain bitch it ain't no debate
That a nigga can't break me
Take me out the game, but they know it's too late
Speeding down a lane that a young nigga paved
Way that I was raised set a young nigga apart from y'all
I recall y'all would doubt me, and now y'all call me
Bitch, hold up
Bitch, hold up

[Verse 3: Lil Peep]
I gotta go right now that's all
Nothing to it don't expect no call
Y'all been plotting on me, praying I fall
I been working, I been giving my all
I gotta go right now that's all
Nothing to it don't expect no call
Y'all been plotting on me, praying I fall
I been working, I been giving my all
