[Hook: Horse Head]
I think about the times we could have had it all
I was in the back then, now I'm in the spotlight
Remember last fall? We could have had it all
But, it's alright (but, it's alright)
But, it's alright
I think about the times we could have had it all
I was in the back then, now I'm in the spotlight
Remember last fall? We could have had it all
But, it's alright (but, it's alright)
But, it's alright

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
You got my number yet? Six hundred sixty-six
Diamond rings, I'm a devil with some angel wings
I know a lot of shit, I don't ever talk shit
Lil Peep, big dick, ask my ex bitch
I've been through a lot of shit, it got me flexin'
I've been through a lot of shit, so it got me sextin'
Got sucked up twice in the same night
Call my baby on the west, catch a late flight
She just hang tight, I know a lot of girls like you
But my world falls down when I fight you
Beside you, can I remind you?
I wanna die too, I wanna die too

[Hook: Horse Head]
I think about the times we could have had it all
I was in the back then, now I'm in the spotlight
Remember last fall? We could have had it all
But, it's alright (but, it's alright)
But, it's alright
I think about the times we could have had it all
I was in the back then, now I'm in the spotlight
Remember last fall? We could have had it all
But, it's alright (but, it's alright)
But, it's alright

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
Clinically depressed gang, GothBoiClique
Wine in my chalice, take a hundred sips
Hundred girls on my dick, but I just want you
Vampire bite your neck, blood on my lip
French kiss, baby, now you're one of us
Now you speak my language, they can't understand us
I'm hot, comin' up like the sunrise
But I feel most alive, in the moonlight
