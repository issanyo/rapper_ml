Let me bleed, watch me die
I got golden teeth, she got bright green eyes
She's my fantasy, she only comes at night
She don’t know 'bout me, what goes on inside
I'll let you feel my pain if you would get me high
Had to make my name, I had to break my spine
Now I’m on my way, I'm just lookin' for pain
Bitches fuck me the same, it don't matter the place, okay
