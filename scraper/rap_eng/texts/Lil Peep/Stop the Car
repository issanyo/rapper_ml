[Hook: LiL PEEP]
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again

[Verse 1: LiL PEEP]
And if I don't break your heart
And if you don't break my heart
I can feel the passion from the start
Girl, its your life, baby, I just wanna play a part
Real Gothbois like it in the dark, real Gothbois like it in the dark
I can feel the passion from the start
Ever since I met her I don't wanna be apart from her
And if I don't break your heart
And if you don't break my heart
I can feel the passion from the start
Girl, its your life, baby, I just wanna play a part
Real Gothbois like it in the dark, real Gothbois like it in the dark
I can feel the passion from the start
Ever since I met her I don't wanna be apart from her

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again

[Verse 2: Horse Head]
So I stopped the car, I don't need nobody
Just the cracks of my heart, I've been feelin' lonely
Silver chains in my heart, I've been caught up
Just take me away I give it all up
So I left the scene, heart beatin' so loud
Why you runnin' away? I need you right now
Silver chains in my heart, like I was so down, like I was so down
Like I was so down
So I stopped the car, I don't need nobody
Just the cracks of my heart, I've been feelin' lonely
Silver chains in my heart, I've been caught up
Just take me away I give it all up
So I left the scene, heart beatin' so loud
Why you running away? I need you right now
Silver chains in my heart, like I was so down, like I was so down
Like I was so down

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again...
