[Intro]
I can feel your eyesight on my skin, red nightlights
Walls close in, Walls close in

[Chorus]
I can feel your eyesight on my skin, red nightlights
Walls close in like last night
I'm all in like last night
I can feel your eyesight on my skin, red nightlights (Whether I'm the one it doesn't matter to you, something about it’s changed, girl, what happened to you?)
Walls close in like last night (Whether I'm the one it doesn't matter to you)
I'm all in like last night (Something seems strange, girl what happened to you?)

[Verse]
She wanna kill me (She wanna kill me)
She wanna kill me watch me bleed
I know you feel me (I know you feel me)
Baby feel me, plant my seed
In your head, when I'm dead
They will not forget 'bout me
In your bed, in my head
Living more or less my dream
They will not forget 'bout me
I got all these hoes on me
But I only want my ex
So I drown my pain in sex

[Chorus]
I can feel your eyesight on my skin, red nightlights
Walls close in like last night
I'm all in like last night
I can feel your eyesight on my skin, red nightlights (Whether I'm the one it doesn't matter to you, something about it’s changed, girl, what happened to you?)
Walls close in like last night (Whether I'm the one it doesn't matter to you)
I'm all in like last night (Something seems strange, girl what happened to you?)
