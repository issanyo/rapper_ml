[Intro]
16 lines-
Of blow and I'm fine
You're wastin' your time, wastin' your time
Please don't cry

[Chorus]
16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones, but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wastin' your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind
I been on my own since age nine
16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones, but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wastin' your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind
I been on my own since age nine

[Verse]
I been on my own for two nights
I been in my zone, I've been high
Now she wonder why do I lie
I can't tell my wrongs from my rights

[Bridge]
Is anybody out there? (Is anybody out there?)
Can anybody hear me? (Can anybody hear me?)
I hate it when you fake care (I hate it when you fake care)
Girl, I know you hear me (Girl, I know you hear me)
Is anybody out there? (Is anybody out there?)
Can anybody hear me? (Can anybody hear me?)
I hate it when you fake care (Fake care)
Girl, I know you hear me (Hear me)

[Chorus]
16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones, but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wastin' your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind
I been on my own since age nine

[Outro]
Is anybody out there? (Is anybody out there?)
Can anybody hear me? (Can anybody hear me?)
I hate it when you fake care (I hate it when you fake care)
Girl, I know you hear me (Hear me)
