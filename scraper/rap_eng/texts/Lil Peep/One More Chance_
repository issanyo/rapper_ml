Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse]
One more chance to give and that's all I have
All I have left in my heart
I've been through enough to know
When you're sad and we're far apart

[Bridge]
Give me some time and I'ma make you mine again (Yeah)
Give me a line so I can write you a line again (Yeah)
Give me some time and I'ma make you mine again (Yeah)
Give me a line so I can write you a line again (Yeah)

[Outro]
One more chance to give and that's all I have
All I have
