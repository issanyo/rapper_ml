[Intro]
Ditty Beats

[Chorus: Teddy]
I be in your nightmares, yeah
Been drinking I can't see clear
I'm so sorry all your dreams are coming true
Hit the lights (hit the lights)
Let it brew, make a move
I be in your nightmares (yeah)
Been drinking I can't see clear
I'm so sorry all your dreams are coming true
Hit the lights (hit the lights)
Let it brew, make a move (yeah)

[Verse 1: Teddy]
Yeah make a move, it is true, I need you (I need you)
Take a trip, marlboro lights, catch a move
I need a piece of the vibe(??) just to go to an island so I can take you
Picking my cup just to kill the cough that I just got from my diamonds, a flu (is it you)
Is it you, is it me? (is it me, is it me)
Hop in the Ghost, so lets take a ride (yeah)
Two hands up in the sky
And I cannot lose all my lucky charms
Think I'm riding the foreigns, from dawn to dawn
Bitch I'm a real don
Eating that pussy like cinnabon
I do not need this life (no)
I do not need it (no)
She's too conceded (yeah)
I do not need it
I do not need this life (no)
I do not need it (yeah)
Diamonds they jump in my eyes
I just can't see it

[Chorus: Teddy]
I be in your nightmares, yeah
Been drinking I can't see clear
I'm so sorry all your dreams are coming true
Hit the lights (hit the lights)
Let it brew, make a move
I be in your nightmares (yeah)
Been drinking I can't see clear
I'm so sorry all your dreams are coming true
Hit the lights (hit the lights)
Let it brew, make a move

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
I could be your nightmare, I could be your dream
I could be your fantasy, sometimes I could be mean
Sometimes I could be nice, sometimes I bring the rice
Sometimes I got my ice on, but baby not tonight
I just caught a fight, I just got off my flight
You should get a life boy, you should get your wife
She just want the pipe, she know that I'm right
She don't wanna fight nah, I think I found my type, yeah

[Bridge: Teddy]
I do not need this life
I do not need it
She's too conceded
I do not need it
I do not need this life
I do not need it
Diamonds they jump in my eyes
I just can't see it

[Chorus: Teddy]
I be in your nightmares, yeah
Been drinking I can't see clear
I'm so sorry all your dreams are coming true
Hit the lights (hit the lights)
Let it brew, make a move
I be in your nightmares (yeah)
Been drinking I can't see clear
I'm so sorry all your dreams are coming true
Hit the lights (hit the lights)
Let it brew, make a move
