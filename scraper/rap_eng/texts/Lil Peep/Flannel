[Verse]
I'll be good, I don't care
My whole life sucks anyway
I could feel it in the air today
I'll be fine on my own
I got no where left to go
You got no one else to turn to now
Will you cry when you die and there's no one by your side
And your bedroom walls are burnin' down
Or will you take your stand tonight
Get your ass away from that light
One more try you'll be just fine
Do what's right, baby, drop that knife
I don't wanna watch you bleed
I don't wanna watch you leave
(Baby, I'll leave too)
I could never live my dream
I would never live my dream
(Baby, I need you)
