[Intro: Slug Christ, Lil Peep, & Both]
Whooaa, it's Slugga, Peep and Tracy
Yeah
I thought you knew pain
Don't lie, don't lie
Don't lie, don't lie
Yeah

[Hook: Lil Peep]
If I gotta I'ma wait in the rain
Girl, you don't know my pain
And my pockets gotta lotta cocaine
Girl, you don't know my name
If I gotta I'ma wait in the rain
Girl, you don't know my pain
And my pockets gotta lotta cocaine
Girl, you don't know my name

[Verse 1: Lil Tracy]
True Religion jeans, pockets full of cocaine
Tattoos on my face, I'ma die this way
I don't want a job so I flex and I finesse
Only inhale the best, exhale the stress
Used to be broke, I cast a spell on my check (yuh)
Ice on my neck, now my ex sends me texts
Ask me if I still love her, I'm on xans, I forget
Bitch, did you forget? You cut through me like a wrist
I'm finna get rich, snortin' coke in a Benz
You don't know my name, you don't know my pain
On the highway to hell in a Beamer, switchin' lanes
Six hundred sixty-six kisses on your face
Baby, now that I'm gone, do you hallucinate?
And see me in your room with that Gucci on my waist?
I'm so far away, now I'm in L.A
Gothic bitch, skinny waist, pussy drippin' like cocaine
Yah, yah

[Hook: Lil Peep]
If I gotta I'ma wait in the rain
Girl, you don't know my pain
And my pockets gotta lotta cocaine
Girl, you don't know my name
If I gotta I'ma wait in the rain
Girl, you don't know my pain
And my pockets gotta lotta cocaine
Girl, you don't know my name

[Verse 2: Slug Christ]
She talkin' got me soddin' in shame, girl, you drive me insane (okay okay)
Only you can occupy any space in my heart, and in my brain
I fade away in saturated gray (okay)
It's just one way (why), to numb it all away (numb it, numb it)
Pain, pain, pain, pain, painkiller
Snort it all away for a second, I'll feel better (okay okay)
Fake ass bitches plottin' on a Young Slugger (okay okay)
Diamorphine and I'm self-medicatin', yeah
See different, you said you felt the same
Girl, I thought you knew my pain
