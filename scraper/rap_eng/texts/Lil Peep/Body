[Verse 1: Atoms]
Chilling with the poltergeist
He wear his frozen clothes
Casket thrashing till I die
These bitches know it, it’s a ghost town suicide
The wind they blowing the leaves they folding
The trees ain’t growing the rivers ain't flowing
Blood overflowing I know you know this
Sipping on the potion, I’m a slug find me in the dirt
You with the roaches find me rapping n husslin' n
Selling the purp I’m with it - you want it
Got that shit that make yo' chest hurt
That’s if you want it I’m a criminal pimpin’
That stay with the weird mother fuckers
With the boys at the crib be off of the garden
These hoes are the hardest rap is retarded
I’m sick though depression coming creeping in
And take you by surprise one day you alive
Then the next day you die

[Chorus: Atoms]
Chilling by myself I don’t need nobody
Find me in the room just another fuckin body
See me in the news but you don’t you don’t wanna
End up on me
Live in this society just to form a fuckin copy
And here is the hardest part

[Refrain: Atoms]
Put it to your head and pull the trigger

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Kill these mother fuckers waiting patient for the flow to come
It’s like I got some supernatural powers, I’m the chosen one
These bitches want me dead, I'm bustin' back
I got a golden gun inside my fuckin hand
I pick a hater put a hole in one
I been working she been twerking on my fucking dick
Pussy perfect but she never got a compliment
I’m too busy stacking twenties cause my money spent
I got kicked out of the crib I couldn’t pay my rent
Young pussy old pussy come pussy go
Never stay the same with these mother fuckin hoes
They be trifling like why you ain’t respecting the flow
Shut the fuck up bitch I’ll break my bottle right on the floor
I’m smokin' dope, I’m getting throat, this beat is wavy, I’m a boat
Bitch I hope you never know the shit I do
When I’m alone
Hell is my home and I ain’t picking up my phone
Get the fuck out my zone and watch yo mother fuckin' tone bitch

[Chorus 2: Lil Peep]
Chilling by myself, I don’t need nobody
Find me in the room just another fuckin body
Dope on my spoon bitch I’m looking like a zombie
I don’t wanna move, you gon see me at the party
