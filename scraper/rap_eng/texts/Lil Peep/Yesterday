[Intro]
Charlie Shuffler on the beat

[Chorus]
Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the same

[Verse]
Today is gonna be the day that I'm gonna come back to you
I know, I did a little blow and I never wrote back to you
My love, I wanna give it all to you
Baby, I just wanna ball with you
I couldn't see the end was comin' near the way I do
About you now

[Chorus]
Change my name, shave my head
Tell my friends that I'm dead
Run away from the pain, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today, yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today
Yesterday is not today is not the same
