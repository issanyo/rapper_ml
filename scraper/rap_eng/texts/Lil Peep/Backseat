[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me
I don't wanna talk, I don't need friends
I'ma get a Benz, will you love me 'til the end?
Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me
I don't wanna talk, I don't need friends
I'ma get a Benz, will you love me 'til the end?

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
I know you love xans, but there is no way you forgot about the way that I held your hand
Should we try again, give it another chance
I don't think it's worth it, I don't think it's worth it
Pouring red wine in a chalice
I sip slow, can't spill it on my fabric
You're like a switchblade, cut right through me
I kinda like it though, baby, cut through me
Vampire in the club in the back now
Heartthrob girls have me as their background
I don't care though, I want you to care though
I cast a love spell, baby, you'll be back though

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me
I don't wanna talk, I don't need friends
I'ma get a Benz, will you love me 'til the end?
Telling me you love me while we fucking in the backseat
Back of the club with the clique if you ask me
I don't wanna talk, I don't need friends
I'ma get a Benz, will you love me 'til the end?
