[Verse 1: LiL Peep]
I can hear the rain fall (I can hear the rain fall)
I can hear the rain fall down
Give me what I payed for (Tell me what I payed for)
Bitch you give me what I paid for now
I love it when you move that (Love it when you move that)
I love it when my body hit the ground (hit the ground)
I love you to the moon back (Love you to the moon back)
I love you when my body in the ground
She never talk about forever with me, she never talk about the future at all (Talk about the future at all)
Wanna walk around forever with me, she tryna fuck with no relations involved (Fuck with no relations involved)
And I'm not used to getting pussy for free I'm used to buying stupid shit at the mall (Buying stupid shit at the mall)
You know baby I would take you to eat
Before I asked if she was licking my *moan*

[Chorus: LiL PEEP]
I burn some bridges then I, watch
I burn the world down, watch
Give a fuck about your, watch
We burn the world down, watch
I'm boutta hit it when she watch
I start switching and they watch

[Verse 2: Bexey]
Yeah you could move or stop or watch
So they watched, they watched, they watched
You know I haven't been round people in a while so to smile feels like I got my trainers on the opposite feet
Treading on thin ice with your lives
Trapped inside with my money it's not much of it but with you I had everything
Do you still remember me?
The one who set you free (Set you free)
To put you back in chains though I'm sorry
I still got blood on my jeans
If they come near you again I'll break Em' down
Their ghosts won't forget me
No way
