[Verse]
Feels like we're worlds away
But we're in the same room
Be my girl today at least
And she don't even know my name
But she look me in the eyes like she knows my pain
That's me
And she always lets me be myself
She don't never take bread
She don't need no help
That's real
While I'm busy trying to get my wealth
She don't worry bout a thing
Except my dick and my health
That's real

[Chorus]
She sees the things that you don't see
She breathes the air that you don't breathe
She bleeds the blood that you don't bleed
She looks at me like she loves me

She sees the things you don't see
She breathes the air that you don't breathe
She bleeds the blood you don't bleed
She looks at me like she loves me


[Verse]
Feels like we're worlds away
But we're in the same room
Be my girl today at least
And she don't even know my name
But she look me in the eyes like she knows my pain
That's me
And she always lets me be myself
She don't never take bread
She don't need no help
That's real
While I'm busy trying to get my wealth
She don't worry bout a thing
Except my dick and my health
That's real

[Chorus]
She sees the things you don't see
She breathes the air that you don't breathe
She bleeds the blood you don't bleed
She looks at me like she loves me

She sees the things you don't see
She breathes the air that you don't breathe
She bleeds the blood you don't bleed
She looks at me like she loves me

[Outro]
She looks at me like she loves me
