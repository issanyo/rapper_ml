[Intro: OmenXIII]
XIII
Yo, what you need? I got you
Yeah, just give me thirty, I got you
A'ight, later

Nigga said he wanna smoke, I'm the nigga niggas know
Hit the clinic real quick, got this dank that take his soul
Motorolla don't flip, Motorolla don't chirp
Got a Droid in my pocket, got your bitch on my shirt

[Hook: OmenXIII]
Ride when I drive, watch me swerve up a curb (skrt skrt)
Niggas said they wanna smoke so I brought the fuckin' herb (yuh)
Brought some Olde E. for my thirst, brought some bodies for the hearse (yuh)
He thought I was takin' shots, but that nigga took 'em first (okay)
'Cause that nigga said he live, but he gettin' on my nerves (yuh)
I ain't have to say a word, all my niggas go berzerk (okay)
Let him burn, let him drop, like a top let's let him drop
Like his heart, don't make it stop, clean it up let's get the mop

[Verse 1: OmenXIII]
Choppin' it up with my squad in the cut
See they passin' me drinks and I'm passin' 'em blunts
And I'm sippin', they smokin', we don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm doin' my thing while we doin' it up
Drinkin' the potion, I'm blowin', you know this
Head bobbin', hypnosis, try not to lose focus
Ain't got no promotion and got no exposure
Still killin' the game and my niggas they know it
Still fuck around with your wack ass crew
Still talk about you, it ain't anything new
Still hear about your name, but I still say "who?"
Still don't give a fuck 'bout anything you do
OmenXIII, fuck with me, fuck with me
Fuckboys run from me when my niggas on the scene, yuh

[Hook: OmenXIII]
Ride when I drive, watch me swerve up a curb (skrt, skrt)
Niggas said they wanna smoke so I brought the fuckin' herb (yuh)
Brought some Olde E. for my thirst, brought some bodies for the hearse (yuh)
He thought I was takin' shots, but that nigga took 'em first

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Smokin' and puttin' my lip on my bitches
They kissin' my dick while I'm typin' my digits
Arthritis inside of my digits from twistin' the piff and
Your bitch think I'm trippin', I'm flippin' the script and
I'm flippin' prescriptions, my vision is blurry
My thoughts are perverted, I'm closing my curtains
And go in the furnace and I bring my ruger to kill Freddie Kreuger, you loser
I'm basically what your bitch dream about
She wanna see me but she never see me out
And when she do she gon' show me what she about
If you got something to say you can scream it out loud
'Cause I don't give a fuck what you think
I got that drip, I think she wanna drink
I'll make it drip, where your pussy is pink
This is OmenXIII, fuck around with Lil Peep
Keep goin', she say she a fiend for it
Told me that you got that lean, pour it
I never step on the scene, boy
I never come out my tree like I'm Pain
Hatin' on me like the leaves when it rain
I feed off the hate, it make me feel great
I'm stayin' up late, she giving me face
Get the fuck out my way when I'm after that cake

[Hook: OmenXIII]

'Cause that nigga said he live, but he gettin' on my nerves
I ain't have to say a word, all my niggas go berzerk
Let him burn, let him drop, like a top let's let him drop
Like his heart, don't make it stop, clean it up let's get the mop
