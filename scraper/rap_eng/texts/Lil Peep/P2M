[Intro]
Let's Smoke Endy!

[Hook: Lil Peep]
I want all the motherfucking money I can get
I want all the bitches bumping me to make em wet
I've been on a plane
You've been on the same old lame shit
If you talking money with me I can speak your language

[Verse 1: EndyEnds]
I've been flying out to different states (different states)
Shawty says she love me I just tell her give me face
Lately I've been dancing with the devil, with the devil
Nobody can stop me put the petal to the metal (skrr)
All these niggas broke
I can't really fuck with ya'll (ah)
250 an ounce every time that money call (brrr!)
Nigga don't you know
I don't front I need it all (yuh!)
Shawty give me face cus she know that i'm a star (yeah!)
I take 1500 then I double that (double that)
I take time to count it then i'm off to cop another pack
I'm up all night long I swear I never sleep (never sleep)
Dirty money on me and it got me looking extra clean
I've been working ages
Probably on your bitches playlist
I ain't finna stop this music till my whip look like a spaceship (skrr)
Know i'm underrated
I don't care i'm getting faded
If you want me on a track or on a stage I need the pay (yeah)
I swear I just came straight from the bank (from the bank)
I know them niggas hate me cus I always smell like dank (heh)
I just got a check I need another (need another)
I can't trust no bitches I just fuck her I don't love her (like ya)
