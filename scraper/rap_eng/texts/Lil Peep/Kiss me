[Hook: Horse Head]
She's too busy ravin'
She don't really care about fashion
I don't think that she can save me
But her eyes burn red with a passion
Like what's the question that you're asking?
My heart was beating so loud
I would be like so down, baby, if you kissed me
And if I left town, would you miss me?

[Verse 1: Horse Head]
I would stay so down, for you
Head underwater I would drown, for you
And I would stick around, for you
Give it all up right now, for you
I would stay so down, for you
Head underwater I would drown, for you
And I would stick around, for you
Give it all up right now, for you

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
You can call me Horse Head cause I'm so down
She ever really wanna do is go down on me
All she wanna do is leave town with me
All I wanna do is make you cry, for me
Tell me right now will you die for me?
Girl, please don't lie to me
Tell me right now will you die for me?
Girl, please don't lie to me

[Hook: Horse Head]
She's too busy ravin'
She don't really care about fashion
I don't think that she can save me
But her eyes burn red with a passion
Like what's the question that you're asking?
My heart was beating so loud
I would be like so down, baby, if you kissed me
And if I left town, would you miss me?
