[Hook: LiL PEEP]
On the same shit, I ain't with the same bitch
Beef with my old bitch, pain in my brain bitch
Lame bitch trying to hit my phone bitch, no bitch
I don't want no old bitch, thinking about my old bitch
Coke shit, I've been on my coke shit
I've been on my own shit, actin' like you know shit
I ain't with the bullshit
I just want a new Benz, I just want a new Benz

[Verse 1: Pollàri]
And I know that they hate me
I’m shinin' on them daily, these bitches wanna rape me
And I know that they hate me
I’m shining on them daily, these bitches wanna take me
Came in blessing now they mad though
I be spending all these racks hoe
No you cannot get no bag
No you cannot get no bag
They believe in my nigga they some heathens
And my side bitch from Sweden
I do it every evening
I got your bitch fiending
She crying and she screaming
Lil 'Llari really beaming

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
On the same shit, I ain't with the same bitch
Beef with my old bitch, pain in my brain bitch
Lame bitch trying to hit my phone bitch, no bitch
I don't want no old bitch, thinking about my old bitch
Coke shit, I've been on my coke shit
I've been on my own shit, acting like you know shit
I ain't with the bullshit
I just want a new Benz, I just want a new Benz

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
I want a new Benz, a new Benz
Pull up to the club, shawty wanna hug
I do my own stunts, flexing I ain't even buff
Damn damn damn you blowing up her Instagram
Damn damn damn I just fucked that bitch again
Finna pull up in a Benz oh
My mouth full of gemstones
She put you in that friend zone
I give her dick like dildo
Feel like Drake, no new friends, boy don't shake my hand
My bitch don't twerk, but all of my diamonds they dance

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
On the same shit, I ain't with the same bitch
Beef with my old bitch, pain in my brain bitch
Lame bitch trying to hit my phone bitch, no bitch
I don't want no old bitch, thinking about my old bitch
Coke shit, I've been on my coke shit
I've been on my own shit, acting like you know shit
I ain't with the bullshit
I just want a new Benz, I just want a new Benz
