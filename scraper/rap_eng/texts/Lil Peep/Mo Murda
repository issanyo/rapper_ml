[Intro: GG Neeks]
More murder
More murder
More murder
More murder
More murder
More murder
More murder
More murder
Baby, more murder, but I don't wanna murder her

[Verse 1: GG Neeks]
I'm killin' her slowly she's lovin' the pain feel
Drag her into my basement and force her to inhale
Off a pill, givin' head, baby lost all her braincells
Shawty, I'm a murderer, but I don't wanna murder ya
What the fuck you gonna do when me and Lil Peep pull up on you like skrrt skrrt skrrt?
I promise you, I got a lot of problems, baby girl, don't even bother Ouh, ouh, ouh
Oh my god!
More murder, more murder, shawty, don't get too close
I don't wanna hurt ya, but I'm lovin' the torture
All the games that we play when we out for the coca

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Yeaaah, I'm off of the vica, I'm a biker when you look at my inka, Drippin' blood in the sink, uh
I'm a drinker, talkin' 'bout pinka
Ridin' round in Encinitas, I'm a creeper, I had sex with my teacher
This bitch is so bad, she let Neeks fuck
This bitch is so bad, she let Peep fuck
I got my face in her D cups, I put my face in the lean cup, I go to sleep and I see stuff
Call it a dream, but I'm livin' it, I pray to God he forgivin' it, I finna cop me a Ritalin
Bitch, who the fuck is you kiddin' with?
You know your shawty is listenin'
(Don't lie to me, bitch)

[Outro: GG Neeks]
I'm killin' her softly, she's lovin' my comfort, close your eyes and breathe deep
I promise you it won't hurt
Take a life before mine, baby, who's gonna die first, shawty
I'm a murderer and I just wanna murder ya
