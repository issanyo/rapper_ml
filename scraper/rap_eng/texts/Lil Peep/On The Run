What moonsongs,
Do you sing your babies?
What moonsongs,
Do you sing your babies?
What moonsongs,
Do you sing your babies?

Do you sing your babies?

[Verse 1: COLDHART]
Baby, are you okay?
Cause I know I drive you crazy
Yeah, I know I drive you insane
But I know you feel the same way
Tell me do you feel the same way?
Too turnt up on a weekday
Too fast living like a freeway
I really hope I see you today

[Hook: COLDHART]
Cause we've been on the run (Run)
Looking for the sun (Looking for the sun)
I'm the one, the one (The one)
I feel like you might be the one
Cause we've been on the run
Looking for the sun (Looking for the sun)
I'm the one, the one (The one)
I knew you'd be the one
The one
That you'd be the one
I know you need someone (Someone)

[Verse 2: LiL PEEP]
I remember walkin' round nothin' good with you
I remember all the things that I put you through
And I'll love you for forever, I've been working for you
I'll be stackin' up my money till' you back in my room
Cocaine on the dresser, but that shit don't impress her
Even if you never met her you gon' feel like you met her
Me and Coldy in the club and we changin' the weather
Me and Coldy in the cut gettin' faded together
I ain't fuckin' with these bitches, I'm in love with my brothers
I'm a lil angel, I do this for my mother
That's why she love me cause she know I ain't frontin'
That's why she love me I'm in love with the money
