*1 minute guitar build*

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Waitin' for my death, while I count some tens
Shawty layin' on my chest in the back of the Benz
I can see you fakin', why you playin' pretend?
I don't even know you, but you act like we're friends?
She ainâ€™t gonna meet another one like me
Puts you to the ground while you kept walkin'
Yeah, it say "Gucci" on my plain white tee
That's a grown man flex, stop playin' with me

[Verse 2: YungJZAisDead]
Baby, I was blazin' in my plain white tee
You can steal my pictures of me and your broken dreams
I waited for your touch, you never waited for me
See me in the dark waitin' patiently for you, tonight
I'm beggin' for your touch, I'm beggin' for your touch tonight
I'm beggin' for your touch, I'm beggin' for your touch
