Killstation:
I can't seem to
Run away (away)
Everyone just
Follows me (me)
I can't seem to
Run away (run away)
Everything just
Falls on me (on me)
I can't seem to
Run away (run away)
Everything just
Falls on me (on me)

Lil Peep:
Wait right here, I’ll be back in the morning
I know that I’m not that important to you but to me girl, you’re so much more than gorgeous
So much more than perfect
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time I can work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losing your patience and girl, I don’t blame you
The earth’s in rotation, you’re waiting for me
Look at my face,while I fuck on your waist;
Cause we only have one conversation a week
That’s why your friends always hating on me
Fuck ‘em though, I did this all by myself
Matter of fact, I ain’t never ask no one for help
And that’s why I don’t pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexing as much as I be
That’s why she text me and tell me she love me

Angel Heart:
Everything is dead
Hate me please
I'm kill yourself
I'm killing yourself
I'm kill myself
I'm kill myself
I'm killing myself

Killstation:
Every day, I feel the same
I can't help but, to feel the pain
And I am just; another name, another face, another vein
Another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein, another vein

Lil Peep:
Help me find a way to make you mine (make you mine)
Everybody telling me not to, but I'm gonna try
Now I'm getting high again, tonight
