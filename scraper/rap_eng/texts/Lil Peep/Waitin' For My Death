Waitin' for my death, while I count some tens
Shawty layin' on my chest in the back of the Benz
I can see you fakin', why you playin' pretend?
I don't even know you, but you act like we're friends?
She ainâ€™t gonna meet another one like me
Puts you to the ground while you kept walkin'
Yeah, it say "Gucci" on my plain white tee
That's a grown man flex, stop playin' with me
