[Intro: YungJZAisDead and sample]
The dreams
I remember my dreams
ColdWorldGang!

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
If I had one night, I would spend it with you
I need help real soon, I'ma die in my room
You wanna come fly too, gettin' high as the moon
I might spread my wings tonight
(Spread my wings tonight)
Iâ€™m gon' pack my things tonight
Phone's gon' ring tonight
Hear the angels sing tonight
(Hear the angels sing tonight)
No matter what you bring tonight
I'm gon' win the fight
Peep gon' make it right
(Peep gon' make it right)
Passin' time, gettin' high in the candle light
Gettin' mine, I be flyin', you can stand aside
But a heart wanna die, I never live my life
You can see it in my eyes, that I can't decide
I'm fucked up, but my heart still beats for you
Broken heart, can't breathe in the waitin' room
Now I'm faced with the test of forgettin' you
Got the whole club packed, try gettin' through

[Chorus: YungJZAisDead]
All night, silhouettes on the blacklights
ColdWorld, I got frost bite, baby
Lips touch, you're so passionate lately
I've been wantin' to bring you back, you'll probably hate me
See me lookin' at your legs when it's dark out
Cigarettes and broken trust in your lip stains
I just wanna know that maybe there's a somehow
You're not the type to fall in love when there's a whole town
Burn slow
Burn low
All black
Forever
You can find me in your dreams, I'll be waitin' for you, baby
Slow when your lips touch mine so gently
Apparition Love, you're my ghost on the dance floor
Apparition Love, you're my ghost on the dance floor

[Verse 2: Nedarb Nagrom]
Passionate Yet just like I'm Wicca Phase
It's been three years since I seen your face
I remember every second spent by the lake
I'm a N.H, motherfuckin' (?)
I was tryna get by, tryna get cake
I only fuck with bitches that (?)
If you fuck with me, you won't be the same
Are you down for this? Are you down for me?
And I can't lie
And I can't hide
Hide them feelin's, you get me high
It's been so long, since I've seen you now
I'm so unhappy when you're not around

[Verse 3: J Trauma]
Hate myself and all my personality traits
I'm gonna blow one day and I'm about to be great
Is that why you said you love me but before you didn't want me?
And you mocked all my attempts, now you here, you tryna fuck me, yeah
Girl saw my bruh and me, you pushed me away
No turning back at this point so I'm looking away
Can't stand the look in your face, don't wanna gaze in your eyes
I'm not amused with playing games but you been playing them right
And I noticed somedays you reminisce all the times you used to kiss and stare at one another silently
Sorry if I reacted a little violently
I swear to God and I promise I didn't mean it how it came across
Can't pay the cost of the damages
I run forever, gone, it's too late to talk it out
You got my phone number blocked and then I can't send a DM
And now I'm miserable the time I wake up to PM

[Chorus: YungJZAisDead]
All night, silhouettes on the blacklights
ColdWorld, I got frost bite baby
Lips touch, you're so passionate lately
I've been wantin' to bring you back, you'll probably hate me
See me lookin' at your legs when it's dark out
Cigarettes and broken trust in your lip stains
I just wanna know that maybe there's a somehow
We never said we'd fall in love when there's a whole town
Burn slow
Burn low
All black
Forever
You can find me in your dreams, I'll be waitin' for you, baby
Slow when your lips touch mine so gently
Apparition Love you're my ghost on the dance floor
Apparition Love you're my ghost on the dance floor
