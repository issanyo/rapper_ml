[Intro]
But I know I wanna take you, leave you alone, ayy
Hmmm, hello?

[Verse 1]
I don't really know where I'm tryna go but I know I wanna take you, yeah
When I'm on the road and I leave you alone I just pray I don't break you, yeah
I was on the phone waitin' in the other room not trying to wake you, yeah
When I'm on my own I'll be sipping Patr√≤n
And I'll be trying to blame you, yeah

[Chorus]
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me, I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me, I know that you don't (I know that you don't)

[Verse 2]
I would give it all back for you right now, I can never forget you
Run away from me, try to run away but I ain't gonna let you
And I can hear my heartbeat sounding like the bass drum
I said baby don't stall with the fucking and the make-ups, nah
I'ma take the long way home
Got a couple hundred missed calls in my phone

[Chorus]
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me, I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me, I know that you don't (I know that you don't)

[Verse 3]
But when you tell me that you love me
I put trust in you don't judge me
I'm just going through some shit right now
And I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down
No, I just wanna leave this town
Sometimes I feel like everyone hates me

[Outro]
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me, I know that you don't (I know that you don't)
Now you calling me crazy, girl I know (Girl I know)
When you tell me you hate me (I know that you don't)
