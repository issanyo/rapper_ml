[Intro: Lil Peep]
Yo, throw me the keys, bruh

[Chorus: Lil Peep & Xavier Wulf]
Motorola phone, I ain't goin' home
I won't go to work, mama hate me and I know it though (And I know it though)
I'm a bad kid with a bad ho
With a fast whip, hit the gas, I'm an asshole
Drive by at 125 (125)
Drive by at 125 (125)
Fly by at 125 (125)
I'ma die, I ain't even 25 (Aye)
Drive by at 125 (125)
Drive by at 125 (125)
Fly by at 125 (125)
I'ma die, I ain't even (Aye) 25 (Yeah)

[Verse: Xavier Wulf]
Ay yeah, slide by doing 225 (225)
I smoke like I don't play because I gotta stay high (Stay high)
I smoke 200 blunts just to get me through the night (Get me through the night)
And then I text her back and told her: "We ain’t gotta fight" (We ain’t gotta fight)
I fold up with my niggas and you know we keep it tight (Tight)
We pulled up to the party, we ain't even tryna fight (We ain't even tryna fight)
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling better than aight (Aight)
I smoke 100 blunts and then I ride into the night, yeah (Night)

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Motorola phone, I ain't goin' home
I won't go to work, mama hate me and I know it though (And I know it though)
I'm a bad kid with a bad ho
With a fast whip, hit the gas, I'm an asshole
Drive by at 125 (125)
Drive by at 125 (125)
Fly by at 125 (125)
I'ma die, I ain't even 25 (Aye)
Drive by at 125 (125)
Drive by at 125 (125)
Fly by at 125 (125)
I'ma die, I ain't even 25
