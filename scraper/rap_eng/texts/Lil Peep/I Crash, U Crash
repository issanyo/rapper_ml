[Intro]
GothBoiClique

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I let the time pass too fast
I crash, you crash
You were the one, that's what I told myself
I don't even know myself
Got my back up against the wall
I let the time pass too fast
I crash, you crash
You were the one, I told myself
I don't even know myself
Or control my self at all

[Post-Hook: Lil Peep]
I can't tell what I want, I can't tell what you want
She can't tell what I'm on
What do you want? Let me sing you a song

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
I wanna hold you so close like a switchblade
I really mean that, I know you don't believe it
I'm shinin' so hard, I know that you can see that
I'd give it up though, I swear I'd give it up though (GOTHBOICLIQUE)
We're movin' so fast, I don't care, I wanna crash
Let our love burn, let our love burn
We're movin' so fast, I don't care, I wanna crash
Let our love burn, let our love burn

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I let the time pass too fast
I crash, you crash
You were the one, that's what I told myself
I don't even know myself
Got my back up against the wall
I let the time pass too fast
I crash, you crash
You were the one, I told myself
I don't even know myself
Or control my self at all

[Outro: Vic Fuentes]
Baby
Pour over, tell me, are we concrete?
What would you do without my perfect company to your undressed spine
And I can hear you...
