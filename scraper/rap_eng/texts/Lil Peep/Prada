[Hook]
One last night
One more chance
One more, kiss
One last dance
I pray I don't miss
But I don't got a chance
Got me in, bliss
Got me in a trance
God damn

[Verse] (x2)
I've been working every damn day
Getting to this money
Who I do it for my brothers
Yeah I do it for my mama now
I ain't with the drama but I'll hit you with the llama
Yeah I put that on my mama
Blood drippin' from my Prada
