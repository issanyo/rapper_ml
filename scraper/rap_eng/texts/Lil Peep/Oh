Shawty hit me on my phone, phone, phone
Say she love me, I say oh, oh, oh
But I'm never comin' home, home, home
Bitch, you left me on my own, own, own
Now I'm gettin' to this dough, dough, dough
Fuckin' bitches on the road, road, road
Now I got a lot of hoes, hoes, hoes
Say they love me, I'm like oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Lil Raven]
Sorry baby I gotta go

I'm flyin' up shawty, watch me fly by
Alright, alright, alright

Ridin' through the city and I got your bitch with me

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
I need that bread like a loaf
I get that neck from your hoe
She is not shy, but she choke
Told me she love me, I'm like oh
Met that lil bitch on the road
She do not want me to go
I just got paid for a show
Turned it up like the stove
I'm conceited, bitch I got a reason
Ice in my mouth, you can see it
Sun out out, but I'm freezin'
Everyday is the weekend
I cannot love a lil hoe
I know you fucked my lil bro
Twerkin' that shit, I'm like oh
Twerkin' that shit, I'm like oh

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Shawty hit me on my phone, phone, phone

But I'm never comin' home, home, home
Bitch, you left me on my own, own, own
Now I'm gettin' to this dough, dough, dough
Fuckin' bitches on the road, road, road
Now I got a lot of hoes, hoes, hoes
Say they love me, I'm like oh, oh, oh
