[Chorus: Lil Peep]
SmokePurpp on a bean
Limousine with a wide screen
Glock 9 with a red beam
Pussy boy wanna try me
'Cause I'm Lil Jeep
Huh, you don't even know my past though
Booked the bitch a flight home, I'ma asshole
God damn, you remind me of my last hoe
And my past hoe, and my past now
All you rap now, bitch, I'm on the map, whoa
SmokePurpp on a bean
Limousine with a wide screen
Glock 9 with a red beam
Pussy boy wanna try me
'Cause I'm Lil Jeep
Huh, you don't even know my past though
Booked the bitch a flight home, I'ma asshole
God damn, you remind me of my last hoe
And my past hoe, and my past now
All you rap now, bitch, I'm on the map, wow

[Verse: Smokepurpp]
God damn, you remind me of my last hoe
I just dropped my bitch, she a dummy, she a crash hoe
And I'm off the drank but I'm still moving kinda fast though
Pouring up the Act when I'm in Houston like I'm Maxo
I had the Act inside the Dro
And I'm smoking cookies, smoking cookie girl scout
And I'm stepping on the gas stove
I just downed a xanny and I hope that I don't crash though
Niggas hating on me and I know that it's the cash flow
Please don't call my phone if you ain't talking 'bout the cash, hoe
I don't do no dirt 'cause I got shooters, I got racks, hoe
And my bitch so cold that she gon' blow me like a saxo
Peep a Beamer Boy
I'ma Rari Boy, play her like Atari, boy
And I don't ever say I'm sorry, boy
I be on my bean, don't need no Swisher, I smoke purp boy

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
SmokePurpp on a bean
Limousine with a wide screen
Glock 9 with a red beam
Pussy boy wanna try me
'Cause I'm Lil Jeep
Huh, you don't even know my past though
Booked the bitch a flight home, I'ma asshole
God damn, you remind me of my last hoe
And my past hoe, and my past now
All you rap now, bitch, I'm on the map, wow
SmokePurpp on a bean
Limousine with a wide screen
Glock 9 with a red beam
Pussy boy wanna try me
'Cause I'm Lil Jeep
Huh, you don't even know my past though
Booked the bitch a flight home, I'ma asshole
God damn, you remind me of my last hoe
And my past hoe, and my past now
All you rap now, bitch, I'm on the map, whoa
