[Pre-Chorus: Saphir]
Catastrophic planes
I can not tame the beast that lives within this tomb
By the throat and from the sky
Come around, repeat the lies
Swimming deeper where I can’t feel too

[Chorus: Saphir]
Ashes to ashes
The blood upon these sheets
Got this shaking in my throat
And these demons after me
Where do I go
When I don't have a path
And the symbol for my soul
Keeps on breaking down in half

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna live though
I just wanna hold you like a crystal
Tell me your secrets, I’m a diary
I can read your mind though, no need to speak
Love hurts, push the knife deeper
Eyes closed, but I can still see her
Forever isn't long enough
I want you for eternity
Share a coffin with me

[Pre-Chorus: Saphir]
Catastrophic planes
I can not tame the beast that lives within this tomb
By the throat and from the sky
Come around, repeat the lies
Swimming deeper where I can’t feel too

[Chorus: Saphir]
Ashes to ashes
The blood upon these sheets
Got this shaking in my throat
And these demons after me
Where do I go
When I don't have a path
And the symbol for my soul
Keeps on breaking down in half
