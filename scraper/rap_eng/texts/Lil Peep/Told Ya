[Verse]
Oh yeah, I told ya
I do it for my soldier
I can show ya, some dough ya
But, then you lose your focus when I told ya, it's over
She call my Motorolla like a ho, ya, I told ya
These bitches wanna fuck in they Corolla, Corona
I'm sippin' and I'm smokin', I'm a stoner, I told ya
I need a couple pounds of marijuana, for the roll up
You know us boys, we smokin' on the Cobra's, I told ya
You know us boys, we smokin' on the Boners, no homo
I'm ballin' like a broker, but I'm broker, I told ya
I'm feelin' like the Joker, get your throat cut, I told ya
I'm shootin' bitches with my super soaker, I told ya
I'm swervin' up the curb in that Rover, I told ya
Your flow so absurd, bitch, I know it, I told ya
One verse, goes for a bird, bitch, I blow it, I told ya
I'm geeked up like a nerd, writin' these poems, I told ya
I'm geeked up like a nerd writin' these
Oh yeah, I told ya
I do it for my soldier
I can show ya, some dough ya
But then you lose your focus when I told ya, it's over
She call my Motorolla like a ho, ya, I told ya
These bitches wanna fuck in they Corolla, Corona
I'm sippin' and I'm smokin, I'm a stoner, I told ya
I need a couple pounds of marijuana, for the roll up
You know us boys, we smokin' on the Cobra's, I told ya
You know us boys, we smokin' on the Boners, no homo
I'm ballin' like a broker, but I'm broker, I told ya
I'm feelin' like the Joker, get your throat cut, I told ya
I'm shootin' bitches with my super soaker, I told ya
I'm swervin' up the curb in that Rover, I told ya
Your flow so absurd, bitch, I know it, I told ya
One verse, goes for a bird, bitch, I blow it, I told ya
I'm geeked up like a nerd, writin' these poems, I told ya
I'm geeked up like a nerd writin' these
