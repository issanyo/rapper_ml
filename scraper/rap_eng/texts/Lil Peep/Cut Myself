[Verse]
Watch the time go by, all I wanna do is get high
Smoke blunts in my ride, turn the music up, I like the vibes
I’m fine, you should worry about yourself every once in awhile
Cracking a smile while I cut myself
Sometimes it feels like nothing help
And that prescription take the pain away
I’m taking acid if it rain today
Watch the clouds while I waste away
Dripping out the sink
No one ever knows what I’m sipping out my drink
