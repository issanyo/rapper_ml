[Intro - Bexey]
Lying down
In this slow drive
Remembering my good share of the darkness

I searched around the corners
Without tracing back to you
Coz you were spiked
By this empty poison

How did you know? (No way)
Even I didn't know that (Know)
Never lonely alone (Alone)
I taught my mirror how to talk back (Real quick)

How did you know? (Know)
Even I didn't know that
Never lonely alone
It's all clearer when you walk back

[Verse 1 - BEXEYSWAN]
I'm watching the staff full of ink drip, fall
Like your tears did
A million dollar masterpiece
On that cheap canvas (arghhh)
Worn underneath
Like a couple of old scarves in the winter (yeah)
Tear through the sheets of my skin when I'm sleepin'
I am deep in
Laughing while I'm crying with a vision, i can't see shit
Young angel demon, bet it's a nightmare dreamin'
How bout' i right-click zoom in
I'm healing while i'm bleeding
Tear your life to pieces
Up on that [?]

[Lil Peep]
How did you know?
Where do i go now, from here
Follow the road
You're on your own now my dear

When i make it to the other side
Of the universe where angels cry
I'ma find you there, I'ma end your life
On sight, make it right
You were my sacrifice

Remembering my good fear of the darkness

How did you know? (Know)
Even I didn't know that
Never lonely alone

[Lil Peep]
It's all clearer when you walk back
I'm getting nearer to the all black
The grim reaper said to call him Jack
I never knew that it would be like that

It's all clearer when you walk back
I'm getting nearer to the all black
I taught my mirror how to talk back
I never knew that it would be like that
(The grim reaper said to call him Jack)

[Verse 2 - BEXEYSWAN]
Building or breaking
It's running so smoothly, earthquaking
I tell you, i love you and hate you
Just to stare at your bottom lip when you're concentrating

Open my arms receptive
Telling your banter to the universe
Dig my foot in the ground, spit on the earth
One person i thought i'd kill

Relax (don't give a fuck)
With you and your eyes
And you flare your fingers
Speak in silence, reaching higher
Live and die
Before the meet and greet
Say goodbye

Give birth to an unopened coffin
Then you bury it beyond the sky
You know why?
