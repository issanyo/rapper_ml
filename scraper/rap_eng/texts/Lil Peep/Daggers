[Pre-Chorus: Bexey]
It's like every girl I love, yeah, she just wanna see me die
It's like every girl I trust wanna put daggers in my spine

[Hook: Lil Peep & Bexey]
Oh don't get too close, girl
You should know when to leave me alone, girl
It's like every girl I love, yeah, she just wanna see me die
It's like every girl I trust wanna put daggers in my spine
Oh, don't get too close, girl
You should know when to leave me alone, girl

[Verse: Lil Peep]
Pockets full of nothing, money in my bag
She told me I'm a druggie so I left and now she sad
Baby, that make you the junkie
You addicted to my lovin'
Even though I know you only love me 'cause I'm buzzin'
What's your motherfucking problem?
I think you need some help
I give you help, that's what I offer, but you left me on the shelf
I'm not a trophy, I got bitches on my belt
I put stitches on the pain, if you listen to me well
Pockets full of nothing, money in my bag
She told me I'm a druggie so I left and now she mad
Baby, that make you the junkie
You addicted to my lovin'
Even though I know you only love me 'cause I'm buzzin'

[Pre-Chorus: Bexey]
It's like every girl I love, yeah, she just wanna see me die
It's like every girl I trust wanna put daggers in my spine

[Hook: Lil Peep & Bexey]
Oh don't get too close, girl
You should know when to leave me alone, girl
It's like every girl I love, yeah, she just wanna see me die
It's like every girl I trust wanna put daggers in my spine
Oh, don't get too close, girl
You should know when to leave me alone, girl
