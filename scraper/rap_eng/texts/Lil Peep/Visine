[Verse 1: Antwon]
I shook hands with David
He told me it's burning
I inhaled the first time
Now I feel like another person
We was all like shit when the first bell rang
It's sending arrow through my heart, bullet in my brain
I can't complain cause I got it for the cheap
My homies they was tripping, now we smoking weed
We smoking
Posted with my G's, just last week bumping Gucci
Used to roll off beans, now we smoking weed with no Visine
Posted with my G's, just last week bumping Gucci
Used to roll off beans, now we smoke weed with no Visine

[Verse 2: Lil Peep & Antwon]
Purple, purple on my lean (Visine)
Purple on my lean (Now we smoke weed with no Visine)
Purple, purple on my lean (with no Visine)
Purple on my lean (Now we smoking weed with no Visine)

[Verse 3: Lil Peep]
Purple on my lean, stains on my jeans
Stay with my team, and my team keep them beans
And I love smoking weed and these bitches love me
I love weed but these bitches love me
Smoke when I breathe, can you cope with the heat
In the boat that I smoke when I post up on my folks
Toast to the goats and the souls when I smoke
I don't need Visine, when you see me shawty know
Bitch I'm high, watch me ride by
Stars in my eyes, gazing at the night sky
I just wanna write rhymes, I don't wanna do time
I got dirty money, you could hear it in my baseline
Shawty give me iPhone 5S FaceTime
Shawty give me iPhone 5S FaceTime
Wi-Fi OG, I don't think you know me
If you want it, you could have it, but it take time

Purple, purple on my lean (Visine)
Purple on my lean (Now we smoke weed with no Visine)
