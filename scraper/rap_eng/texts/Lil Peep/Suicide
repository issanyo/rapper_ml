[Pre-Hook: Lil Peep]
I just spend a 100 on a double cup
Sucking on me, say it when I fucking nut
Fucking on me, molly got me fucking up
Lil Peep, shawty, let me fuck it up
I just spend a 100 on a double cup
Sucking on me, say it when I fucking nut
Fucking on me, molly got me fucking up
(Who?) Lil Peep, shawty, let me fuck it up

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Bitch, who wanna die? Suicide
Homicide, I'ma ride
Bitch, who wanna die? Suicide
Homicide, I'ma ride

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
GothBoiClique in the back of the Vic, can't drop no racks on a bitch
Baby, I'ma crash in the whip, on my suicide shit with a suicide bitch

[Verse 1: Mackned]
Look, you wasted all these years
You knew inside that I could never love you
You know I'm whipping foreigns on the avenue
I traded your whore for some revenue
GothBoiClique all black, black label
I love it, so painful and so unfaithful
West Coast demon deep inside of an angel
She sucking on the goon, swear she love 'em more than I do
Already rock a side bitch so you can be my side boo, yeah, yeah, yeah
Me and Peep designer everything so we flood in Gucci, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
GothBoiClique in the back of the Vic, can't drop no racks on a bitch
Baby, I'ma crash in the whip, on my suicide shit with a suicide bitch

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Bitch, who wanna die? Suicide
Homicide, I'ma ride
Bitch, who wanna die? Suicide
Homicide, I'ma ride

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
I don't want a friend now
I just want a Benz now (Skrt)
Everybody friends now
Okay, I guess I'll be setting trends now
Baby, I'm just waiting for the end now
Girl, you got me waiting for the end now
She don't know I live what I talk 'bout
Let 'em know I'm living what I'm talking 'bout

[Pre-Hook: Lil Peep]
I just spend a 100 on a double cup
Sucking on me, say it when I fucking nut
Fucking on me, molly got me fucking up
Lil Peep, shawty, let me fuck it up
I just spend a 100 on a double cup
Sucking on me, say it when I fucking nut
Fucking on me, molly got me fucking up
(Who?) Lil Peep, shawty, let me fuck it up

[Verse 3: Mackned]
Yeah, I heard you wanna die
BigHead killed the beat, no rapper, call it suicide
She left out the party, nose stuck inside a mountain side
Get Bands Clique, keep the blue notes unified
Sacrificed everything but I was never crucified
Idolized some junkies, now we glorified
Got the limelight, now we magnified
