[Intro]
If it's my own life on the line then it's fine by me
'Cause my time is fadin'
I got five hoes, right by my side
They wanna die with me, but I'm tired of waitin'

[Verse]
If it's my own life on the line then it's fine by me
'Cause my time is fadin'
I got five hoes, right by my side
They wanna die with me but I'm tired of waitin'
Let me know and I'll go tonight
On my own not a soul in sight
All alone with my ghost tonight
Let me know if it's scarin' you girl
I don't even wanna fuck right now if you really want to you could fuck me
I don't ever put my double cup down if you really want to you could drug me
I ain't ever gonna run my town imma kill everybody I'ma bounce
I don't ever gotta talk that loud everybody get quiet as a mouse (shhh)
