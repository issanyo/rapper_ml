[Chorus]
I met her by chance
I said: "I really like your pants
I know you got a man
Gimme your hand" (fuck it)
Teen romance
Gimme this dance
Yeah, I took a Xan (yeah)
I hope you understand
(She don't)
Let me guide you
To a place where
No one hurts you
You are safe here with me
(With me, with me)

[Chorus]
I met her by chance
I said: "I really like your pants
I know you got a man
Gimme your hand" (fuck it)
Teen romance
Gimme this dance
Yeah, I took a Xan (yeah)
I hope you understand (she don't)
Let me guide you
To a place where
No one hurts you
You are safe here with me
