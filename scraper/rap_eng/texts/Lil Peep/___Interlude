[Verse]
Two racks on my new shoes
Why the fuck I do that?
Tell me, why the fuck do I do that?
Two racks on some Gucci shoes
Why the fuck do I do that?
Tell 'em why the fuck I do that
Who's that with you in the room?
Why the fuck do you do that?
Tell me, why the fuck do you do that?
Girl, you know that I'ma die real soon
Why the fuck do you do that?
Tell me, why the fuck do you do that?

[Chorus]
Gimme a break from all this bullshit
Gimme a break from all this bullshit
Gimme a break from all this bullshit
She just want me for the culture, damn
Gimme a break from all this bullshit
Gimme a break from all this bullshit
Gimme a break from all this bullshit
She just want me for the culture
Gimme a break from all this bullshit
Gimme a break from all this bullshit
Gimme a break from all this bullshit
Gimme a break, gimme a break

[Bridge]
Gimme a break from all this bullshit
Gimme a break from all this bullshit

[Verse]
Two racks on my new shoes
Why the fuck I do that?
Tell me, why the fuck do I do that?
Two racks on some Gucci shoes
Why the fuck do I do that?
Tell 'em why the fuck I do that
Who's that with you in the room?
Why the fuck do you do that?
Tell me, why the fuck do you do that?
Girl, you know that I'ma die real soon
Why the fuck do you do that?
Tell me, why the fuck do you do that?

[Outro]
Fuck...
