[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
I hit the dope two times, take the stress off my mind
I hit the coast and I ride, come up quick on your side
I'm like a ghost half the time, I'm just creepin' behind
I'm never slow, I follow
Take your soul, you hollow
Bass kickin' like your bitch, kidnappin' for kicks
Come six, pop a stitch while she bitin' my lip
Don't flip, don't dip, better not move too quick
I'll take that grip right off your hip then smack your ass with the clip
Hollow tips spit like a blue nose pit
Hold my shit, I'ma fuck your bitch
Bump Three 6 while I cut my wrist
Fuck my kicks, then I break the rim
When I dunk that shit, blood stain the Timb'
No shit, got razor blades in my fist, take a listen
Only time I put the blade down when I gotta pick up my pen
Fuck your Benz, I'ma paint the Cadillac black
Can't see me in the night with the lights off
Quicksand on the white walls
Livin' life on the edge, bitch, I might fall
Don't give a fuck what they say about me
Lil Peep won't rest 'til I rest in peace
S on my chest when I come up on the beat
Full moon flex while you mothafuckas sleep
Make my will while I take my pills
Kill your best chills when I make my bills
If I get killed, I know I'ma die real
Stay real still, you already know the deal
You already know the deal
Lil Peep poppin' Henny bottles, fuck your seal
I love the way you feel, so I do it for the thrill
Say she wanna chill, bitch, I know the fuckin' deal

[Verse 2: Death+]
Young shady mothafucka, undiscovered when I'm comin'
If you hear me, get runnin', when you see me, get low
[?] see the profit, no bands in my pocket
So I'm skunkin' up and gettin' back on my flow
White trash boys, just some white trash boys
Flippin' up the middle finger to these mothafuckin' hoes
I ain't talkin' 'bout the women, nah I'm talkin' 'bout the bitches
That be pushin' all your music and they sell that flow
I never gave a fuck about a deal
So I ain't ever fuckin' with a man that signed one then
All these internet bitches hoppin' on my dick
Life turnin' into shit, I'm finna slit my wrist
Spittin' a mist, flickin' my wrist to these bitch boys
All I ever hear you do is talk shit, boy
I hear you rep about the trap, but it ain't shit, boy
Ho I've been known for fuckin' grindin' and got shit for it
What the fuck, bitch, rhymin' ain't gon' cut it, bitch
You got no creativity, you ain't no artist, bitch
You [?] hardest bitch
You just a pussy ass mothafucka startin' shit
I spark a blunt, blow the smoke into the fuckin' breeze
Thinkin' how the fuck I'll get out of these fuckin' streets
Climbin' up to the top, to the fuckin' leaves
I can't even fuckin' see what's underneath

[Outro: Death+]
Too high, too much
So alive, but I'm done
Smokin' nothin' but dust
And it's all I ever loved
I don't wanna think about it now
All I ever wanna see are clouds
Too high, too much
So alive, but I'm done
Smokin' nothin' but dust
And it's all I ever loved
I don't wanna think about it now
All I ever wanna see are clouds
