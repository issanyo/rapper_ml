[Intro]
MoneyPosse
Ooh, big-big head on the beat

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
Bands up, man down
Why my bro wear my back, cause the streets foul
Hands up, on the ground
Got the police knocking at your mama house (knock, knock)
Bands up, man down
Why my bro wear my back, cause the streets foul
Hands up, on the ground
Got the police knocking at your mama house (knock, knock)

[Verse 1: Lil Tracy]
Used to catch the bus to school, now I'm catching it from you lil boo
I just bought me some new shoes, Ed Hardy my jeans, this is not True
Shout out my bro KirbLaGoop, we 'bout the beef, but we sipping that fruit
I mixed the coke with the xan, doing my dance on top of the moon
Hol' up, wait, why is these niggas so fake?
Back in the day they would hate
Now they trying to eat off of my plate
You is funny little bitch
Got a model on my dick
Wifing that ugly little bitch
Ew, yuck, gross, sick

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
Bands up, man down
Why my bro wear my back, cause the streets foul
Hands up, on the ground
Got the police knocking at your mama house

[Verse 2: KirbLaGoop]
Knock knock, who's that?
Go through the back, better hide your pack
You ain't getting it back, adios
Team mat cause the track, who gone ride who?
Its all on, it's all on me
Ski mask professor, I ain't here to trick-or-treat
I got freaks to meet, hella hoes to geek
Make 'em run a scrip, write my grip, check the street
I don't trust a soul, nah
I don't trust a soul 'cause I know that they be telling
They gone snitch up in they folk
I ain't even post again here right now
I was supposed to be in penitentiary six feet underground
