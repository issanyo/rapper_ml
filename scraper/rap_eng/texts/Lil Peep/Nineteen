[Intro]
Yeah, I don't wanna do you like that
Why you gotta do me like that?
'Cause I got face tats and my boots black
I don't wanna go to school, I'on like that
Everybody think I'm cool, I'on like that
Codeine by the pool while I write raps
Spend money like a fool, I'mma make it back

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna hate you
I don't wanna do you like that
Why you gotta do me like that?
'Cause I got face tats and my boots black
I don't wanna go to school, I'on like that
Everybody think I'm cool, I'on like that
Codeine by the pool while I write raps
Spend money like a fool, I'ma make it back

[Verse]
I'ma have a couple million when I'm 21
Shawty told me that she thought that I was 21
Now she want me even more 'cause I'm fuckin' young
Hatin' on me, 24, you a fuckin' bum
Bitch, I'm always off them drugs when I'm in the club
I ain’t smokin' on a dub, I got lots of bud
All these bitches fall in love, but I'm not the plug
All these bitches fall in love, I'm the only one
Say wassup...

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna hate you
I don't wanna do you like that
Why you gotta do me like that?
'Cause I got face tats and my boots black
I don't wanna go to school, I'on like that
Everybody think I'm cool, I'on like that
Codeine by the pool while I write raps
Spend money like a fool, I'ma make it back

[Verse]
I'ma have a couple million when I'm 21
Shawty told me that she thought that I was 21
Now she want me even more 'cause I'm fuckin' young
Hatin' on me, 24, you a fuckin' bum
Bitch I'm always off them drugs when I'm in the club
I ain’t smokin' on a dub, I got lots of bud
All these bitches fall in love, but I'm not the plug
All these bitches fall in love, I'm the only one
Say wassup...
