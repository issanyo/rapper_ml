[Chorus: Horse Head]
We never cared at all
We never cared at all
Everything's fucked up
Now I don't feel okay at all

[Verse 1: Horse Head]
Now that you're gone
I put myself together pull me apart
Said you tried real hard
So I guess this mess was all my fault
And if a bomb gets dropped
The parking lots are still filling up with people
Who seem to ignore, the world at war
How can any love be classified as evil?

[Chorus: Horse Head]
We never cared at all
We never cared at all
Everything's fucked up
Now I don't feel okay at all

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Just know that I'ma hold you down
So down
So down
So down
It's on now
It's on now
Right here, right now
We could glo now
Baby we could glo now
We could glo now
Where you wanna go now?
Whatever you want I'm a hold you down
You're my princess and you need a crown (Yeah)

[Chorus: Horse Head]
We never cared at all (I'm a Time Bomb driving with my eyes closed)
We never cared at all  (See you later, maybe never I don't even know)
Everything's fucked up (I'm a Time Bomb driving with my eyes closed)
Now I don't feel okay at all (See you later, maybe never I don't even know)
We never cared at all (I'm a Time Bomb driving with my eyes closed)
We never cared at all  (See you later, maybe never I don't even know)
Everything's fucked up (I'm a Time Bomb driving with my eyes closed)
Now I don't feel okay at all (See you later, maybe never I don't even know)
