[Chorus]
I had a plan to kill
Myself and you for real
With my gun, I'll take your life
I'm no fun without my knife

[Verse]
If I I want to I will cut you, I will make you feel my pain
If I need to I will bleed you, I will make you go insane
When the time comes I will sacrifice my love in the moonlight
Whenever I cum I feel half as nice as I did when it's you, right
