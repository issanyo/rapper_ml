[Chorus]
Juggin' on a Friday, but saw you on the freeway (skrrt)
How could I forget that face, I don't even know your name
I'm in love with a ghost girl, all alone in a lonely world
I just really wanna find her, I'ma do another line first

[Verse]
Lyin' on the asphalt, Lil Peep, blacked out
Fuckin' with the CokeWave, let my man Max out
I be on some real shit, get it from my OG
I don't wanna hear shit, shawty, what she told me
I don't give a fuck, bitch, I be on my lonely
Lookin' for the right girl, why you all up on me?
Love me for a night, girl, hate me in the mornin'
Yeah, I know you're tight girl, so I make her blow me
Lil Peep

[Bridge]
Look me in my eyes, girl (look me in my eyes, girl)
Tell me if you think that it's a lie, girl (lie, girl)
Gettin' tired of your girl (gettin' tired of your girl)
I know I need my own girl, my girl (my girl)
Look me in my eyes, girl (look me in my eyes, girl)
Tell me if you think that it's a lie, girl (lie, girl)
Gettin' tired of your girl (gettin' tired of your girl)
I know I need my own girl

[Chorus]
Juggin' on a Friday, but saw you on the freeway (skrrt)
How could I forget that face, I don't even know your name
I'm in love with a ghost girl, all alone in a lonely world
I just really wanna find her, I'ma do another line first
