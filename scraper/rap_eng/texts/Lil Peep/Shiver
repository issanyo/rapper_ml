[Hook]
Lookin' for a reason to live
I can't find shit
So, I'm squeezin' the trigger
I let my mind
Split up into bits of pieces for dinner
You eat them brains, bitch
I know she cum when she shiver

[Verse]
Don't give a fuck about you
Say they hate me
I don't give a fuck about who
Aye, I pull up in a coupe
Lookin' like soup
Real hot, jaw drop like the roof
I remember livin' life like you
Smokin' on boof
Lil' broke boy with a gold tooth
I could never live my life like you
Young brand new lil peep
Came through with the juice

I could never live my life like you
Young brand new lil peep
Can't do with the juice
