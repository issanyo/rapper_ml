[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ahhhh
Fuck it
I used to dream of you
Nah, I used to lose my sleep from you
But now I see right through
And everybody wanna fuck with me
But I'on fuck with you

[Verse]
I used to dream of you
Nah, I used to lose my sleep from you (From you)
But now I see right through
And everybody wanna fuck with me
But I'on fuck with you (Nah)
I use to scream at you, nah
I use to turn my cheek at you (at you)
But now I need you too
And everybody give a fuck 'bout me
And I ain't nothin' to you
I'm just lookin' at my life while it go down the drain
I got pain in my brain, but I don't never complain
I'm insane, I'm deranged, I see your face in the rain
This ain't no race for the fame, but at this pace I'ma make it
Face it, you basic, Lil Peep your replacement
I'm takin' your spot
I'll give it back when I'm rakin' the guap
Maybe not
I keep on checkin' my statements
I'm checkin' for payments
While you checkin' ya plays bitch (plays bitch)

[Hook]
I been doin' my own thing lately
I been holdin' my own thing for safety
I don't pick up the phone till they pay me
They  askin' me how it feel, I say it's crazy
I been doin' my own thing lately
I been holdin' my own thing for safety
I don't pick up the phone till they pay me
They askin' me how it feel, I say it's crazy
