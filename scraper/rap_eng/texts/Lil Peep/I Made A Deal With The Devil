[Verse 1]
Cup in my hand when I woke up
Double cup in my hand when I woke up
Try to understand where I'm comin' from
Please try to understand, you not, you not
Much of a man, you should grow up
You should grow up, you should grow up
Why you got your hands out, see me comin' up?
See me comin' up, see me, see me

[Hook]
I make her feel what she never felt before
I make a deal with the devil to settle the score
I might reveal what you never thought would be shown
I make a deal, kiss my bezel, then get on the floor

[Verse 2]
Same shit with the same bitch
I can't quit 'cause nobody else speak my language
Pain hit when I ain't lit
That's why I gotta stay high, come die on my blanket
Geeked up 'cause I laced it
No stunt, glo'd up, geeked up in the basement
And your girl is a rapist
That's my dick she takin', bitch, I'm basic

[Hook]
I make her feel what she never felt before
I make a deal with the devil to settle the score
I might reveal what you never thought would be shown
I make a deal, kiss my bezel, then get on the floor
