[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I got drugs in my coat, I put love in my coke
Everywhere I go, hoes wanna give me throat
I got mud, I got blow, I get lonely on my own
Tell my plug hit my phone, and your bitch give me dome
Back to the drugs, pop a pill, fall in love
With a stripper in the club, I got demons in my mud
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Coke in her nose and my dick all in her butt
Red drop shawty, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck, hell nah

[Verse: KirbLaGoop]
Two blue pills and they both 30 millis
I be flippin' in the city if I got Bobby and Whitney
I got 2 for the 20 bet they know I get it in
I be flippin' on the 10 with my kin, fuck a friend
7.5. rollin' live 'cause they know it's west side
In the north cross the track, where I ride where I die
That's why I got it tatted on me, you can see it in my back
Yeah, I'm 100 til the death and you can hear it in my breath
I'm never ever pealin', I've never ever froze
Stay true I was told put a hunna on the stove
I'ma never switch up, and I never ever change
My whole life I've been strugglin', I'll forever be the same

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I got drugs in my coat, I put love in my coke
Everywhere I go, hoes wanna give me throat
I got mud, I got blow, I get lonely on my own
Tell my plug hit my phone, and your bitch give me dome
Back to the drugs, pop a pill, fall in love
With a stripper in the club, I got demons in my mud
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Coke in her nose and my dick all in her butt
Red drop shawty, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck
Red drop cups, baby I don't give a fuck, hell nah
