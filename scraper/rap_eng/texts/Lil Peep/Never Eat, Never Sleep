[Intro: Lil Peep]
Yeah
Angel wings on my whole damn team (woo!)
Everybody they put
Pull up Fly Away on the bitch
Shout out Kirb
Shout out to Raven

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Blood on my teeth, don't be walkin' down my street
I be in the dark, white bitch never eat
I be in the dark, white bitch never sleep
Pull up in a park and these bitches look at me (look at Peep)
Brick walls, ain't nobody getting in now
Fake friends, they don't wanna see me win now
Deep water, they don't wanna see me swim now
Water on my wrist, castle for my bitch now

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
I dropped out of school, but that money comin' in
My mouth full of jewels, she like it when I grin
Tracy the prince, sippin' champagne inside of the Lyft
My castle big, I'm sorry girl but you can't come in
Lil Peep why, why do they hate?
My bitch so bad, told that bitch to behave
I run it up, they wanna see me crawl
All they do is talk, please get off my balls (yuh)
Brick walls, ain't nobody gettin' in now
The moons out, I feel like myself again now
Fuck you, fuck her, and fuck them
If I die today you would try to fuck my bitch
Brick walls, ain't nobody gettin' in now
The moons out, I feel like myself again now
Fuck you, fuck her, and fuck them
If I die today you would try to fuck my bitch

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Blood on my teeth, don't be walkin down my street
I be in the dark, white bitch never eat
I be in the dark, white bitch never sleep
Pull up in a park and these bitches look at me (look at Peep)
Brick walls, ain't nobody gettin' in now
Fake friends, they don't wanna see me win now
Deep water, they don't wanna see me swim now
Water on my wrist, castle for my bitch now
Brick walls, ain't nobody gettin' in now
Fake friends, they don't wanna see me win now
Deep water, they don't wanna see me swim now
Water on my wrist, castle for my bitch now
