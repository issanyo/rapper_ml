[Intro: Bexey]
R-E-P-A-I-R
R-E-P-A-I-R
Oh woah-u ohhh-u-oh
Oh woah-u ohhh ohh

[Verse 1: Bexey]
I wonder
Where you are
What's the condition of those wings you have
I look up
Try to move the sky
Took the silver linin'
Now it's just copper

[Chorus: Bexey]
Gonna get that
Gonna fight back
R-E-P-A-I-R
Gonna get that
Gonna fight back
R-E-P-A-I-R
I watch the dust wander 'round my room
Hear the wind whistlin'
Memories of, you

[Verse 2: Lil Peep & Bexey]
I remember lookin' at you through the window in my bedroom
I remember nights on nights spent thinkin' 'bout you
Now I'm tryna buy back
All the time that you consumed
I wonder
Where you are
Lookin' past the stars
Have we grown apart?
I'm underneath your spell
Baby, can't you tell?
Such a putrid smell
I wonder
I got a shoe box full of broken hearts (R-E-P-A-I-R)
Letters for you, I've torn apart (R-E-P-A-I-R)
My last breath in the candle-light (R-E-P-A-I-R)
Cap myself and I say goodnight (R-I-P)

[Verse 3: Bexey]
Yeah, I see you over there
B-b-b-b-baby how's your wealth?
Diamond, and trant, and trim
You can never fly slow or low or shy them
Come 'gain, the illusion got me
Confusion, had ten mirrors on me
I analyze and got paralyzed, I don't magnify
And I know if anyone led astray by a zombie
And Simon says, "follow the leader"
That quote was before he stopped breathin'
Now his ghost speaks to me every evenin'
I shared that lesson when the mirror started speakin'

[Outro: Bexey]
Ha ha!
Haha ha!
Oh dear Simon...
Maybe it's time to stop doing the Simon says, Simon says that, Whatever the fuck
Stop playin' follow the leader
How about you follow yourself to that chair
Make that chair your own, man
Sit down, and be quiet
For once
Okay, great
