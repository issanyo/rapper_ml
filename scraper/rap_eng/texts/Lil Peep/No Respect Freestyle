[Verse 1]
Cry me a river, I'ma buy you a belt
But the pain's still the same and this guap don't help
(And this guap don't help... at all)
Drop a molly in my Sprite, leave that right on the shelf
Where the white? Where the white? Only time that she yell, only time that she yell
(Only time that she yell)
That ain't right

[Pre-Hook]
Ripped jeans, big screens, bad bitch and she 18
She can be my lady, you can be my lady
Hate me, everybody hate me
Every day I wake up, everything achin'

[Hook]
You ain't got no loyalty, then I got no respect
You ain't got no loyalty, then I got no respect
I got no respect, I got no respect
You ain't got no loyalty, then I got no respect

[Verse 2]
Everybody know I'm next, got these bitches sendin' texts
Bitches sendin' texts 'cause they know that I'm up next, yeah
I'm on a jet, yeah, on a jet
I'm takin' bets, I'm takin' bets
What do you expect? What do you expect?
What do you expect? What do you expect?
What do you expect? What do you expect?
What do you expect, baby?
What do you expect for me to do for you?
What do you think I have to offer you?
It's cold outside tonight and I...
And I don't got a roof over my head
It's cold outside tonight
I remember when we shared that same apartment
I loved it, and I... and I, and I
And I hate holdin' grudges (holdin' grudges, yeah)
But fuck it, I don't care no more
I don't care, I don't care at all
Not enough
Not enough at all

[Pre-Hook]
Ripped jeans, big screens, bad bitch and she 18
She can be my lady, you can be my lady
Hate me, everybody hate me
Every day I wake up, everything achin'
You ain't got no loyalty, then I got no respect
You ain't got no loyalty, then I got no respect
I got no respect, I got no respect
Everybody know I'm next, got these bitches sendin' texts

[Hook]
I got no respect, I got no respect
I got no respect, baby, I got no respect for you
I got no respect, yeah
What do you expect? Yeah, yeah

Everybody hate on me, everything achin'
Everything achin'
I got no respect, I got no respect
