[Hook: Milkavelli and Lil Peep]
I don't go to bed I just fall asleep
I don't go to bed nah I just fall asleep
Voices in my head I can hear always talk to me (now what you sayin'? What you sayin' now?)
But I don't go to bed man I fall asleep

[Verse 1: Milkavelli]
Yo, I tried to count the sheep, reached 1000 sheep
Had to stop counting I was over an hour deep
Jump out the Merc, you hop out the Jeep
I'm screaming S.O.S but I'm still lost out at sea
Penny looking sweet, deck chairs on the balcony
VVS teeth for my moment of clarity
All the drugs in me need a moment of clarity
My girl and I something like Mickey and Malorie

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
I don't go to bed I just fall asleep
Girl give me head I can't barely see
I feel like I'm dead, I can barely breathe
I been taking meds so I can fall asleep
I been thinking a lot, the drugs get me deep
I been drinking a lot, I trip on my feet
And my pills are cheap I give 'em out for free
When I fall asleep I don't have no dreams

[Hook: Milkavelli and Lil Peep]
I don't go to bed I just fall asleep
I don't go to bed nah I just fall asleep
Voices in my head I can hear always talk to me
But I don't go to bed man I fall asleep

[Middle 8: Lil Peep]
Nightmares to you is my life to me
Please talk the truth or I'll have to leave
In hell with you, I want to be
I'm evil too, she's worse than me
Bring back the pills 'cause I'm taking three
Bring back the pills and don't play with me
If that's your girl it's okay with me
She don't love you and you cannot see, I'm praying for you

[Verse 3: Milkavelli]
Yo I been a Xanny head, I been a Vali head
Pack of great white shark my weed's the hammerhead
New chain on my neck hanging like saggy breasts
I been blowing dough I need to go to Hatton's less
Splash fest since I cash the check
I need to have a rest, I need to bank the rest
I ran a red, crashed the Benz, bled when I cracked my head like the DVL GNG axe I was claret red

[Hook: Milkavelli and Lil Peep]
I don't go to bed I just fall asleep
I don't go to bed nah I just fall asleep
Voices in my head I can hear always talk to me
But I don't go to bed man I fall asleep
