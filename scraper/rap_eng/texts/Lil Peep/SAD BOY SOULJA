[Intro: Yung Bans]
Gus Gang, bitch, we rep that Gus Gang
Gus Gang, bitch, we rep that Gus Gang
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
R.I.P. to Peep, yah
Sad boy soulja for real, sad boy soulja for real
(That's why I got the "Crybaby" tat... on my face, got a humongous tattoo that says "Crybaby" and shit)
R.I.P. to Peep, yah
Sad boy soulja for real, sad boy soulja for real

[Verse 1: Yung Bans]
Gus Gang, bitch, we rep that Gus Gang
Sipping on that red bottle, say he wants that Tuss thing
Horses on the whip, but baby, this is not a Mustang
Off so many drugs, bitch, I don't know how I got much pain
This shit off the wall, young nigga just wanna ball
Lost so many dawgs, this shit ain't fair at all
Designer drugs mix, got my fingers in her kit cat
Hit a lick, bitch mad, lil nigga, sit back
Free the gang, all dawgs go to heaven, nigga
Muscle on these hoes, man, somebody needa tell these bitches
Innocent till guilty, they still treat me like a felon nigga
Fuck the D-A, pussy, I'ma seven figure nigga

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
R.I.P. to Peep, yah
Sad boy soulja for real, sad boy soulja for real
(That's why I got the "Crybaby" tat... on my face, got a humongous tattoo that says "Crybaby" and shit)
R.I.P. to Peep, yah
Sad boy soulja for real, sad boy soulja for real

[Verse 2: CHXPO]
You look in the mirror and see a fuck nigga
I look in the mirror and I see a hitter
Made a hundred thousand jugging in the sprinter
So Icy Tha God, Goth Angel Sinner
Need me a Louis scarf for my cold heart
I ain't got no heart, nah, I ain't got no heart
Go hard, bitch, I go hard
I hang with the rockstars, tote choppers like they tote guitars
On the Boulevard, jugging all day
Selling hard in the hallways, tryna catch a play
Bitch, you know I'm Gus Gang, goth bitch for the gang
She just flew in from LA, she just wanna snort some yay'

[Chorus: Yung Bans]
R.I.P. to Peep, yah
Sad boy soulja for real, sad boy soulja for real
(That's why I got the "Crybaby" tat... on my face, got a humongous tattoo that says "Crybaby" and shit)
R.I.P. to Peep, yah
Sad boy soulja for real, sad boy soulja for real

[Outro: Yung Bans]
Gus Gang, bitch, we rep that Gus Gang
Gus Gang, bitch, we rep that Gus Gang
Gus Gang, bitch, we rep that Gus Gang
Gus Gang, bitch, we rep that Gus Gang
