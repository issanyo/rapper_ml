[Chorus]
Call me on my phone, I don't pick it up
I ain't never home, I been fuckin' up
I don't even know, if I give a fuck about anything
I don't give a fuck
Call me on my phone, I don't pick it up
I been on my own, baby I been fuckin' up
I don't even know, if I give a fuck about anything
I don't give a fuck about anything

[Verse]
Ride till the wheels fall off and my heart stop
I can't feel my face but I won't stop
Can't stop, girl you know I can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, girl you know it don't stop

[Bridge]
Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me till my heart stop
Yeah, yuh
Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me till my heart stop (Till my heart stop)
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Fuck me till my heart stop

[Chorus]
Call me on my phone I don't pick it up
I been on my own, baby I been fuckin' up
I don't even know if I give a fuck about anything
I don't give a fuck
Call me on my phone, I don't pick it up
I ain't never home, I been fuckin' up
I don't even know, if I give a fuck about anything
I don't give a fuck about anything

[Verse]
Ride till the wheels fall off and my heart stop
I can't feel my face but I won't stop
Can't stop, girl you know I can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, girl you know it don't stop

[Outro]
Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me till my heart stop
Yeah, yuh
Fuck me when the beat drop
Baby, fuck me till my heart stop (Till my heart stop)
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Bleeding out my laptop
Blood leaking out my laptop
Fuck me till my heart stop (Fuck me till my heart stop)
