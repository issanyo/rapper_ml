[Intro]
"When it comes to drugs, pill-pushers and takers, we are a country virtually out of control. If you're feeling depressed, to get relief, take a pill. Most of us are addicts."

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Life gets hard sometimes I know
So I be leaning, I be smoking my dope
I see your face everywhere that I go
It's the only thing that reminds me of home
I be with my team racing whips on the roll (skrrt)
Rolling off a bean that I took at the show
Young limousine Hummer backseat rider
She only call my phone when she think that I'm dying
Baby you're the one for me that's fo' sho'
I just need your company so ride slow
This ain't what you want from me so cold
Girl you're the only one for me I know

[Chorus: Cold Hart]
You're the only one that I love
I can't name one person I trust
If you're on one, then I'm on one too
If you're leaving, then I'll go with you
You're the only one that I love
I can't name one person I trust
If you want one, then I'm on one too
If you're leaving, then I'll leave with you
I'll leave with you
I'll leave with you, I'll leave with you
Cold Hart, baby, GothBoiClique

[Verse 2: Cold Hart]
Yeah she asking me, "What are we?"
I'm like, "What you mean?" (What you mean?)
I'm smoking gasoline with my team
GBC, they'll be there with me
I know I ain't shit but you a masterpiece
Kurt Cobain jeans, you my Courtney Love
Thraxxl Rose how I got the club going up
Taking bars for anxiety
Smoking kush is my therapy

[Chorus: Cold Hart]
You're the only one that I love
I can't name one person I trust
If you're on one, then I'm on one too
If you're leaving, then I'll go with you
You're the only one that I love
I can't name one person I trust
If you want one, then I'll find myself
If you're leaving, then I'll leave with you
I'll leave with you

[Outro]
"A lot of people have seen their friends die. I don't want anyone to see any of their friends die anymore."
