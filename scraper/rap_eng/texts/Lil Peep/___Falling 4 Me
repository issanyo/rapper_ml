[Verse]
Hold me, I can't breathe
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna OD
Cup full of lean, pure codeine
Ten lines deep, now I can't see
I don't wanna be this way for good
I don't wanna live the way I should
Born in the 'burbs, but I'm big in the hood
Tell me that I can't, but I know that I could

[Chorus]
I can't hear you callin' to me (yeah)
I can't see you're fallin' for me (yeah)

[Verse]
I can't hear you callin' to me (yeah)
I can't see you're fallin' for me (yeah)
Hold me, I can't breathe
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna OD
Cup full of lean, pure codeine
Ten lines deep, now I can't see
I don't wanna be this way for good
I don't wanna live the way I should
Born in the 'burbs, but I'm big in the hood
Tell me that I can't, but I know that I could
