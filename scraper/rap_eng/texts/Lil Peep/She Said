[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
If you love me like you say you do
Why you acting like I pay you to
Lil Peep and Boy Froot
Goth girls they let me through
She say can I follow you
She say can I swallow you
Singin' isn't all I do
Would you get me all of you
She say can I follow you
She say can I swallow you
Singin' isn't all I do
Would you get me all of you

[Verse 2: Boy Froot]
I be flexin' man that's all I do
I ain't textin' i ain't callin' you
I'll leave my message had me rollin [?]
I ask no questions [?]
Shawty call my phone I'm not picking up
I'm too busy ballin' on my apple pie
Back of the club pouring double cups
Double up my stacks [?], bruh

[Outro: BOY FROOT]
Yayaya

Turnin' up in this club, bitch I'm turnin' up in this club
Turnin' up in this club, bitch I'm turnin' up in this club
