[Intro]
Before your funeral
And your coffin lid is closed
Before you are buried
And your flesh turns cold
Before you are covered with the last shovels of dirt
Before you are really
Dead

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Get the fuck up out my way
Get the fuck up out my motherfuckin' way
Get the fuck up out my face
I don’t like you motherfuckers anyway
Now I'm fuckin' up my pay
Now I’m gettin' lots of money every day
Catchin' pussy like a fade
Catch a young'n getting hundreds what I say
Got the bible on the dash
Boutta smoke it til its ash
Now my rivals gettin' mad cause they open to the fact
I might do this shit for real
Spend a thousand on a seal
Make a hunnid fuckin' mil
Now I pull up and I peel
Skrr

[Verse 2: Kronik Williams]
She hit me up tryna rise some
I'ma grab the alcohol and perceibe the rubbin' aye
They takin cash no reply comin’
When you high as dispel the sky plummet
Leanin’ leanin', bitch I need the canes
See the color purple, sippin’ purple rain
Moved dough bring the new flame
Magic man like I'm David Blaine
Eye for an eye, I bitch you gon' see the pain (pain)
Coldest in the game
Tryna Ice-pick ya brain (brain)
Wit' me or it diss me, get the fuck up out my face
Fuck up out my way (skrr)
Holdin’ up my line (skrr,) bitches fuckin with my pain (skrr)
Das gon' make me hate (hate)
Prayin' at the dollars comin' adequate the rate
Smokin' up to palm bet that you can smell the way
Burnin' ten swishes sweet just preparin' for my day
Bitch
