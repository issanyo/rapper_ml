Thoughts run through my mind
Girl I'm gon' be fine
I spend all my time
To try to make you mine
Trying to get you high
Off something that only I supply
I'm talkin that make you want to cry
Yeah I'm talkin that make you want to die
Get lost in the smoke
I'm hard to find
Young boss fucked ya hoe she off the lines, based dope
Blow and lose your mind
Pull up to the show and cut the line
Everybody ain't know that I'm one of a kind
Everybody ain't know that imma get my shine
I ain't fuckin wit a hoe if she need my time
All I really fuckin know is stayin on my grind
Ayy
One step closer
I feelin like I was chosen
My wrist always open
My blood always frozen
I know
I'm never sober
It's fine
Cuz i like it that way
If you got somethin' to say
Say that shit to my face
One step closer
I feelin like I was chosen
My wrist always open
My blood always frozen
I know
I'm never sober
It's fine
'Cause I like it that way
If you got somethin' to say
Say that shit to my face
