[Pre-Hook: lil skil]
I can see it in your eyes, that you wanna get out
I can see it in your eyes, that you need it right now
That you need it right now
That you wanna get out
That you need it right now
That you wanna get out

[Hook: lil skil & Lil Peep]
Yeah, I just wanna hear the sound
Drive our Camaros out of town
Baby, we could leave right now (woah)
Yeah, I just wanna feel alive, baby take your time
Smokin' on this loud (woah)

[Verse: Lil Peep]
Girl, you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss, then we fuckin'
I just can't get enough
Put it on me, that's the best part, baby, the trust
Trust me
I got nothin' for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie till the sun came up
All the places that you took me no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me, now they on my, nuts
