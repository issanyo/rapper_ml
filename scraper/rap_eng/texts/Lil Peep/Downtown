[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wanna ride around town with me
Making money ridin' 'round downtown with me
Everybody wanna ride around town with me
Making money ridin' 'round downtown with Peep

[Chorus]
I be in the backseat smoking on thrax
Can I have some cash please? You don't gotta ask
You don't gotta ask me, she don't gotta ask
Still yelling free Max B, free Gucci
Fuck me in the backseat baby make it last
I remember last week came too fast
Lil Peep nasty scratches on the back
But I got racks and she loving on my tats
Making money back

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wanna ride around town with me
Making money ridin' 'round downtown with me
Everybody wanna ride around town with me
Making money ridin' 'round downtown with Peep

[Chorus]
I be in the backseat smoking on thrax
Can I have some cash please? You don't gotta ask
You don't gotta ask me, she don't gotta ask
Still yelling free Max B, free Gucci
Fuck me in the backseat baby make it last
I remember last week came too fast
Lil Peep nasty scratches on the back
But I got racks and she loving on my tats
Making money back
