[Verse]

You know its wrong when the pain feels right
Double cup my liquor so i spend the night
G-Wagon come and pick me up tonight
I just want you baby stay up in my life
I know im wrong but I'm tryna make this right
Cheap bongs that you smokin hit this pipe
Couple xans in yo system feelin nice
Pass out. Wake up like it is alright

One more night then baby you gotta go home
Shoulda known this from the start that what we got can't leave this room
When I die you won't know what to do you cryin to this song
Yeah im prayin to the sky
I don't even know why

Oh, I don't think i can take this any more
No, i shed the blood on my wrist on the floor
Oh, what is you talkin bout my stuff js dope
Play this song when they put me in a whole for eternity so they can reap what they sew
Oh, i don't think i can do nothin but flow
No, i don't know what she be lovin me for
Oh, i don't know why you in love with me though
I keep enphetamines up in my coat
Im in the zone when im all on my own
