[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Yaaah, I'm geeking off them bars
Oh my god, oh my god, with the withdrawals, oh my god
Oh my god, fucking god, I'm fucking gone, I need god

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
I've been geeking every fucking weekend
I've been tweaking while my blood seeping
They put it deeper, know my bitch sleeking
She got demons, I got lots of demons
(I got demons) Oh my god

I've been tweaking while my blood seeping
They put it deeper, know my bitch sleeking
She got demons, I got lots of demons

[Verse: Slug Christ]
I've been OD'ing every fucking weekend, damn
I've been OD'ing every fucking weekend
I've been doing Xanny bars and heroin every day
I've been fucking hoes in and out the state
They gon' fuck me, love me, swallowing the semen
I've been dreaming, I've been dreaming, I've been dreaming
Slug Christ slugging, fuck the police
Slug Christ drugging, [?] worried
Fuck a bitch, don't need it
In love with dope, I need it
I don't fuck with existence so I think that I'ma leave this shit behind
But just for tonight
Unless I do too much and die tonight
Fuck boy gonna say [?]
Use me as example but this ain't no love
You wanna live, I'm fucking lit
Slugga always been day one with the shits
Shout out all my Awful brothers, sisters, damn
Miss y'all, man, I love y'all, we gon' be rich, fuck the world
Fuck the world
Pressed as fuck but at least I'm racked up

[Bridge: Slug Christ]
Every weekend, every fucking weekend

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Geek geeking all night, no sleeping
Skeet skeeting on that bitch, taste my semen, yeah
Started bleeding out my nose, now she screaming
I'm about to overdose, still fiending

[Outro: Slug Christ]
I've been OD'ing every fucking weekend
Yung Lil Slugga, Yung Lil Peepee
I like to chill alone but I complain 'bout being lonely
I'ma fucking idiot, yo hating ass ain't gotta tell me
Stupid bitch, leave that shit alone, I already know I'ma piece of shit
