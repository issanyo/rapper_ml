[Verse: Charlie Cleasby & Hoppy]
I'm a motherfucking schema boy, I'm a dreamer boy
I love a girl that don't even fucking need a boy
Baby, I'm a beamer boy, I need a beamer, boy
I want a Z3, that's a two-seater, boy
Okay, I pull my cash out, shorty pass out
Take her ass out, then I spaz out
Okay, yeah, I hit that, shorty, get back
I got death notes, where's my list at?
Yeah, I'm in my zone now, I put my phone down
I'm on my own now, I'm on my own now
Your girl, she wanna go down on a real one
I hit JGRXXN, like "What's the deal, bruh?"
You see me doing shows now, I'm a pro now
I got hoes now and I got some dough now
But they don't wanna hear that, they want some real shit
They want that drug talk, that "I can't feel" shit
I'm never coming home now, I'm all alone now
Can't let my bros down, can't let my bros down
I feel like I'm a no-one, that's what they told me
I'ma show you, baby, I was chosen (Aye)

Clears throat, I fucked up
