[Sample : Your Back Porch - Knuckle Puck]
It's 4am again and I'm falling asleep with the headphones in
It shouldn't be like this
And it's so hard to act like I'm over this
When everything you said tore my heart out of my chest

[Verse 1: SOWHATIMDEAD]
Said I'm slidin' T-Mobile side kicks wide open
Eyes wide shut, keep 'em closed when I'm roastin'
Been about a minute since I started gettin' in it
But I'm ridin' wit my windows rolled up when I'm smokin'
40 missed calls and I'm never callin' back, no
Shawty miss ya'll, but I'm pullin' up on back roads
Never goin' back home, hit me on my traccphone
Dropped it on the flag stone, I never had the back bone
How much longer do I gotta sit here
And wait for my phone to light up and tell me that you are near
I'm tryin' to fuck with you
And wait for my phone to light up and tell me that you are near
I'm tryin' to fuck with you

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Not tonight
I don't wanna talk at all
Baby, you was just not right and this town was way too small (town was way too small)
Maybe we can work it out one day (work it out one day)
But I'ma need a whole year on my own (whole year on my own)
But I don't wanna stop there let me say for this one last time, lemme take you home (lemme take you home)

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
If I didn't hurt you I would keep you
I can't believe that I'm never gonna see you
If I didn't hurt you I would keep you
I can't believe that I'm never gonna see you
