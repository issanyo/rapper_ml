[Intro: Mackned]
Ayy, sodium that salt
Ayy, sodium they salty
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Mackned]
I think I just booked a hotel
I think I just left her, I kill
I'm flipping this shit, I could seal (Yeah)
She's tripping buying some skill (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I be fucking on her fiends
Skate in Gucci like Vans
Fuck [?] shooting half cut, yeah
They hating on with them keeping the opps so upset, look, look
Call the bitch a Uber and I made her walk back, look
I could see the future, might keep balling mad racks, look
Play by play, just a game player, look
Fuel jets in my curfew
There's something cold, yeah
Missed Max with that gold, yeah
That shit yellow ain't a rose, yeah
I don't where you was raised, but I'm from where it grows

[Chorus: Mackned]
Sodium they salty
Sodium that salt
Sodium they salty
Sodium that salt
Your bitch, she a naughty
Your bitch know I'm dogging
I'm so optimistic
But, sodium they salty

[Verse 2: Mackned]

[Chorus: Mackned]
Sodium they salty
Sodium that salt
Sodium they salty
Sodium that salt
Your bitch, she a naughty
Your bitch know I'm dogging
I'm so optimistic
But, sodium they salty

[Verse 3: Lil Peep]
Everybody calling on my phone, not calling on my phone
Like I'd still fuck with you (fuck with you)
(Sike) I'd stop fucking with you twice, I don't wanna act nice
I don't wanna take a picture (Nah, a picture, nah)
Hoes wanna fuck me for my face, think it's something
'Bout my face got her boyfriend tripping (Why you tripping man?)
No competition, just hate
It's a lot of fucking snakes in this goddamn business (Damn)
I do my thing on a bitch (Bih)
You put a ring on a bitch (Bih, bih)
I took a perc when I woke up (Yeah)
I took your girl when I walk up (Damn)
Pull up and sing on a bitch (Woo)
I feel like a king in this bitch (Yeah)
Ten racks for a damn verse, ten racks in my man purse (Woo, woo)

[Chorus: Mackned]
Sodium they salty
Sodium that salt
Sodium they salty
Sodium that salt
Your bitch, she a naughty
Your bitch know I'm dogging
I'm so optimistic
But, sodium they salt
