[Verse]
Ask me if I care how much
I'll tell you hell no (hell no)
Ask me if I need your love
I'll tell you I don't (I don't)
I gave everything, I had just to be here with her (be here with her)
Now money got the girl so mad might reconsider (reconsider)
Tell me you love me
Even if you lie to me
Tell me I'm ugly
Even if you vibin' with me
Tell me you love me
Even if you lie to me
Tell me I'm ugly
Even if you vibin' with me

[Hook]
Tell me you love me
Even if you lie to me
Tell me I'm ugly
Even if you vibin' with me
Tell me you love me
Even if you lie to me
Tell me I'm ugly
Even if you vibin' with me
