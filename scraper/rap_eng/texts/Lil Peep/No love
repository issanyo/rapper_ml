[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
I end your life with the edge of my knife
White mask, flickin' my ash, no cash
Same day I cop it I crash
Pick apart my brain, bitch, I'm insane
Right hook like bane, fuck batman
Lil Peep, bitch, I'm tryna raise the crime rate
Two 12s in the trunk let it vibrate (vib-vibrate)
Aw that's really raw, that's really raw
Young 16 killers, bitch my friends are my dealers
(aw aw aw) Aw that's really raw, that's really raw
Dry blood on my knife when I enter the fight, motherfucker

[Hook: Lil Peep]
I'm showin' no love, no hope, no chain on my neck
No respect, boy yo bitch got no complaints
I'm showin' no love, no hope, no chain on my neck
No respect, boy yo bitch got no complaints

[Verse 2: Mikey Cortez]
Take yo life
Bitch, I'm blastin' on sight
Without no mask
See my face when I blast
Blow your brains then I dash
Pop a xan and go ham
Homie I don't give a damn
I probably scam my own fans
Probably blow my advance
God damn that's really cold boy
That's really cold
16 years as a dealer, and all my homies are killers
God damn that's really cold boy
That's really cold, warm blood on my blade
I never once felt afraid
I'm talking no love, but I got hope
Big chain on my neck, boy give me my respect
I'm talking no love, but I got hope
Big chain on my neck, boy give me my respect
Mikey...
