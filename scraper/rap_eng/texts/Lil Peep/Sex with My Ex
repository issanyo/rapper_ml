[Chorus]
Fuck me like we're lyin' on our deathbed
I can feel the sudden emptiness
I'm here to grant your one last wish, so
Fuck me like we're lyin' on our deathbed
Hear the sadness in your laughter
She's afraid of what comes after me, true love

[Verse]
I don't know when I'll be back in town (Back in town)
All I know is that she'll wait around, for me
All I know is that she'll hold me down (All I know is that she'll hold me down)
My girl keeps all ten toes on the ground, for me
I can feel it, I can feel it now
I can feel you watchin' after me, holdin' my breath

[Bridge]
Catch a feelin'
Catch a feelin' now
I still feel your skin all over me
Sex with my ex

[Chorus]
Fuck me like we're lyin' on our deathbed
I can feel the sudden emptiness
I'm here to grant your one last wish, so
Fuck me like we're lyin' on our deathbed
I can feel the sudden emptiness
I'm here to grant your one last wish, so

[Verse]
I don't know when I'll be back in town (Back in town)
All I know is that she'll wait around, for me
All I know is that she'll hold me down (All I know is that she'll hold me down)
My girl keeps all ten toes on the ground, for me
I can feel it, I can feel it now
I can feel you watchin' after me, holdin' my breath

[Bridge]
Catch a feelin'
Catch a feelin' now
I still feel your skin all over me
Sex with my ex

[Chorus]
Fuck me like we're lyin' on our deathbed
I can feel the sudden emptiness
I'm here to grant your one last wish, so
Fuck me like we're lyin' on our deathbed
I can feel the sudden emptiness
I'm here to grant your one last wish, so

[Outro]
Fuck me like we're lyin' on our deathbed
I can feel the sudden emptiness
I'm here to grant your one last wish, so
(Fuck me)
