[Interlude: Lil Peep]
I'm dead as fuck they call it
I'm long gone

[Instrumental]

[Interlude: Lil Peep]
If I find someone and if I fall in love with someone and if I have a kid then you know, shit might change, but right now, uhhh
I'm out here making music you know and the shit I talk about it real so, I don't, you know, not much to lose right now

[Instrumental]
