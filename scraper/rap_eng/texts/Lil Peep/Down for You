[Intro]
— Why... why won't you say something?
— I don't want to
— Why not?
— If I tell you how I honestly feel, I think that I will vanish. Thank you for all that you've done for me

[Chorus: Cold Hart]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, you were meant for me
I swear ain't no one else down for me
Like you, you
You're the one I want, I'ma give my life to you
Baby, you were meant for me
I swear ain't no one else down for me
Like you, you
You're the one I want, I'ma give my life to you

[Verse: Lil Peep]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby gettin' bent for me
Countin' up the days that you spent with me
You stay true, stay true
You're the one I want, I'ma live my life for you-ou-ou
And she always next to me
In the back of the club, come flex with me
Have sex with me, send texts to me
Get dressed with me, be a mess with me

[Chorus: Cold Hart]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, you were meant for me
I swear ain't no one else down for me
Like you, you
You're the one I want, I'ma give my life to you
Baby, you were meant for me
I swear ain't no one else down for me
Like you, you
You're the one I want, I'ma give my life to you
