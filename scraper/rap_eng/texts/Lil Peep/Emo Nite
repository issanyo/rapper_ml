[Intro: LiL PEEP]
Every night is emo night
Every, every, every
Every night is emo night

[Verse 1: Little Pain]
In the party chillin and you know I'm in my feelings, yeah
Smokin' all that reggie but I'm higher than the ceiling, yeah
Posted with my niggas there's a bunch of gothic bitches here
Yeah I'm owin' paper but I'm feeling like a millionaire
These bitches blow my kisses, yeah
A bitch will slit her wrist in here
I'm drinking all the liquor here
Shit is getting lit in here
My niggas say I'm widlin' but you know that I don't listen, yeah
The Henny almost empty so I'm crying while I'm pissin', yeah
My durag is attached to me
I think it wants to marry me
Some niggas do not care for me
You niggas put no fear in me
Your bitch cryin' right here with me
I don't think that you hearing me
Emo Nite is therapy
Come and shed a tear with me

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
Rainfall, on my skin
Now I'm feeling low again
Blood snow, on my timbs
Henny and Klonopin
Walked in, now I'm wet
Oxy with the Percocet
Broke as fuck, getting checks
Blood dripping down my neck
Rainfall, on my skin
Now I'm feeling low again
Blood snow, on my timbs
Henny and Klonopin
Walked in, now I'm wet
Oxy with the Percocet
Broke as fuck, getting checks
Blood dripping down my neck

[Verse 2: Little Pain]
Yeah my father missing, but my durag made of satin, yeah
Teardrops keep on dripping and my durag keep on dragging, yeah
I just met a girl that could've won a beauty pageant here
She looked like the princess so I guess that I'm Aladdin, yeah
Dealin' with depression but I'm thuggin' with a passion, yeah
And my latest song is blasting, so not everybody dancin'
And a couple niggas hatin', but don't nothing ever happen, yeah
Because hate is temporary, but the love is everlastin'
In the club but I feel like I'm at home
It's almost time to go, put your number in my phone
These tears just ain't for show
Everybody feeling 'lone
In the club full of people, but we all feel alone, let's go

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
Rainfall, on my skin
Now I'm feeling low again
Blood snow, on my timbs
Henny and Klonopin
Walked in, now I'm wet
Oxy with the Percocet
Broke as fuck, getting checks
Blood dripping down my neck
Rainfall, on my skin
Now I'm feeling low again
Blood snow, on my timbs
Henny and Klonopin
Walked in, now I'm wet
Oxy with the Percocet
Broke as fuck, getting checks
Blood dripping down my neck
