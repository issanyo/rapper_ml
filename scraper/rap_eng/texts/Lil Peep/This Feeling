[Chorus]
I can give you everything, aye
Blood on the wedding ring, damn
I can make her levitate, aye
I can make her medicate
Drugs in my winter coat, aye
Got my plug on a fishing boat, damn
That feeling never getting old, aye
You don't ever listen hoe, damn

[Bridge]
Look in my eyes, I'm right by your side
Edge of the night, finna wanna end my life
Look in my eyes, I'm right by your side
Edge of the night, finna wanna end my life

[Chorus]
I can give you everything, aye
Blood on the wedding ring, damn
I can make her levitate, aye
I can make her medicate
Drugs in my winter coat, aye
Got my plug on a fishing boat, damn
That feeling never getting old, aye
You don't ever listen hoe, damn
