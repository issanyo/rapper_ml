UNRELEASED

[Intro]
Charlie Shuffler on the beat

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Run away with the one
That's gon' be there till it's done
Take the blame for the gun
That's gon' be there for your son
If it's me, I don't know (Charlie Shuffler)
But at least I'll make her smile
Would you lie here for a while?
Would you lie here 'til I die?

[Post-Chorus: Lil Peep]
When I look at you
I can see right through
And you know it's true
So you love me too
Girl, I always knew
It was me and you
And you'll know it's true
When you say "I do"

[Verse: Cold Hart]
You know I'ma say "I do" (You know)
'Cause every time I leave I be missing you (I be missing you)
And I know you will say "I do" (Oh)
'Cause I look up in your eyes, I can tell it's true (Tru-u-e)
On a winter night, I ran away so far
I ran away with you
We slept inside my car
Run away with the one
That's gon' hold you when you're numb
Takes you home, when you're drunk
Holds your hair, when you're throwing up
If it's you, I don't know
But at least I have some time
Just to lie here by your side
Counting all the stars tonight
Girl I always knew, I see me and you (Yeah)
Leaving in a coupe, painted baby blue (Blue)
Baby, I need you
You're like a dream come true (You are)
And yeah I always knew (Yeah I knew)
That it will be us two
Took a long way home
Bumping all our songs
Smoking cigarettes
And feeling up her dress
I always miss you the most, when I'm smoking dope
They say "Love heals you slow"
That's why I'm with you

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Run away with the one
That's gon' be there till it's done
Take the blame for the gun
That's gon' be there for your son
If it's me, I don't know
But at least I'll make her smile
Would you lie here for a while?
Would you lie here 'til I die?

[Post-Chorus: Lil Peep]
When I look at you
I can see right through
And you know it's true
So you love me too
Girl, I always knew
It was me and you
And you'll know it's true
When you say "I do"
