[Verse]
Ice in your veins
Blood in your brain
I feel your pain
I think we're goin' insane
I saw you today
And I thought I should say
That I still love you like I did back in two thousand and eight
Okay
Girl, I got whatever you want right here
I ain't never lettin' you leave, my dear
I'ma tie you up and I'ma lock you away
You don't ever listen to the shit that I say
I'ma make you listen to me
I'ma make you listen to me
Smokin' on some loud
Out the motherfuckin' pound
I'ma give ya bitch a ounce for free
