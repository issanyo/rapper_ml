[Intro]
Give me your all, all
Give me your all, all, all, all

[Chorus]
Give me your all, baby I ain't comin' up to fall
At first, you gotta crawl, then you get this tall
I ain't had much help now I'm all on my own
In my room, why the fuck is people callin' my phone?
Wish it's you but it ain't, now I'm stuck in my head
Feelin' like I'm dead lookin' up from my bed
I don't need nothin', 'cept a dollar and a dream
I don't even need the dollar, I would rather have a bean

[Verse]
I had no one, you were someone
Someone to help me, someone to save me
I had no one, you were someone
Someone to help me, someone to save me from myself

[Bridge]
Give me your all, all
Give me your all, all

[Chorus]
Give me your all, baby I ain't comin' up to fall
At first, you gotta crawl, then you get this tall
I ain't had much help now I'm all on my own
In my room, why the fuck is people callin' my phone?
Wish it's you but it ain't, now I'm stuck in my head
Feelin' like I'm dead lookin' up from my bed
I don't need nothin', 'cept a dollar and a dream
I don't even need the dollar, I would rather have a bean

[Outro]
Give me your all, all
Give me your all, all
Give me your all, all
Give me your all, all
