[Intro: KirbLaGoop]
Man, you soft as yo motherfucking daddy back in '96, dawg
That's on granny bitch, that's on mommy bitch, on hunnid bih
You motherfucking boys ain't shit, everybody pussy
Straight up, act like my hoe

[Chorus: KirbLaGoop]
Don't be fucking with my family, I'll lay you 6 feet
I ain't scared to die now, and who gon' miss me?
Wet the block on the spot, re-rock and repeat
I don't love these hoes, you love these hoes, you give em freebeez
Don't be fucking with my family, I'll lay you 6 feet
I ain't scared to die now, and who gon' miss me?
Wet the block on the spot, re-rock and repeat
I don't love these hoes, you love these hoes, you give em freebeez
Don't be fucking with my family, I'll lay you 6 feet
I ain't scared to die now, and who gon' miss me?
Wet the block on the spot, re-rock and repeat
I don't love these hoes, you love these hoes, you give em freebeez

[Verse: Lil Peep]
Everybody pussy, everybody pussy
Bitch, I wanna die but no one wanna shoot me
Everybody pussy, I don't know what happened
He said he a savage, he ain't even trappin'
He ain't even pimpin', he don't know 'bout pimpin'
Fall for that pussy, get that cocaine like it's Christmas
Bitch I'm going crazy, Xans got me lazy
Your bitch wanna date me, police tryna tase me
Yo bitch wanna rape me, yah, yo bitch wanna taste me, yah
[?], I got 8 young bitches
Pull up on me, pay me
If you ain't homie
Pull up on me, spray me
But you faking, homie
Real life shit, real life shit
I got 20 on my wrist, real life shit
Struggle with my habits, I was strugglin' paying rent
Bitch I saved a bag, who got pills? Let me get, yah

[Chorus: KirbLaGoop]
Don't be fucking with my family, I'll lay you 6 feet
I ain't scared to die now, and who gon' miss me?
Wet the block on the spot, re-rock and repeat
I don't love these hoes, you love these hoes, you give em freebeez
Don't be fucking with my family, I'll lay you 6 feet
I ain't scared to die now, and who gon' miss me?
Wet the block on the spot, re-rock and repeat
I don't love these hoes, you love these hoes, you give em freebeez
