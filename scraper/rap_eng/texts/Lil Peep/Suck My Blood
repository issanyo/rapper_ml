[Intro]
You let me down just like my drug
I can see a frown when I call my plug (brr)

[Hook]
Lookin' at the ground while she suck my blood
Baby, let me down just like my drug
I can see a frown when I call my plug
I ain't off that brown but I love my mud
Lookin' at the ground while she suck my blood
Baby, let me down just like my drug
I can see a frown when I call my plug
I ain't off that brown but I love my mud
And she don't know shit 'bout me
And she ain't gettin' nothin' but some dick out me
She be in the club, without me
But that's okay, she always pick out me

[Verse 1]
I be in The Bay, I be in LA
I be on stage, bitches kissin' on my face
What I'm tryna say
Let's take it by the day
I'm the one you want, not the one you tryna save
I got a broken heart, you were like a blade
Tearing me apart, but I kinda like the pain
She like it when it rain
She like that I'm insane
I like it that she gay
She like me for my brain
Lil Bo Peep

[Hook]
Lookin' at the ground while she suck my blood
Baby, let me down just like my drug
I can see a frown when I call my plug
I ain't off that brown but I love my mud
And she don't know shit 'bout me
And she ain't gettin' nothin', but some dick out me
She be in the club, without me
But that's okay, she always pick out me
