[Verse 1: BOY FROOT]
I'm a Goth Boi
I'm cuttin' up bok choy
I'm workin' in produce
So fuck what you know, dude
I'm a little goth boi, smokin' goth thrax
I ain't got dry bud, all I got is wax
All I do is dab, bitch, all I do is dab
If you feelin' sad, then just smoke your whole sack
Bitch, I'm with my whole team and we always glowing
I don't give a fuck 'bout you 'cause you don't know me
No you don't know me, no you don't know me
No you don't know me, no you don't know me, bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
You don't know me at all
I ain't pickin' up when I get your call
I just flipped a quarter bag, blew it at the mall
I ain't worried 'bout what the fuck you gotta say at all
Keep it to yourself, drugs on the shelf
If it wasn't for my plug then I wouldn't have this belt
Yeah I need some help, yeah I'm goin' to hell
All my exes dead in the basement you can smell
I just need a goth queen tonight
I just wanna fuck you in the candle light
I ain't rockin' Trues, like my jeans real tight
Like my pussy and my food teriyaki white rice, lil' bitch
I just need a goth queen tonight
I just wanna fuck you in the candle light
I ain't rockin' Trues, like my jeans real tight
Like my pussy and my food teriyaki white rice, lil' bitch
