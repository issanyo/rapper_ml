[Verse 1]
You don't know me at all
I ain't pickin' up when I get your call
I just flipped a quarter bag and blew it at the mall
I ain't worried 'bout what the fuck you gotta say at all
Keep it to yourself, drugs on the shelf
If it wasn't for my plug then I wouldn't have this belt
Yeah I need some help, yeah I'm goin' to hell
All my exes dead in the basement you can smell

[Chorus]
I just need a goth queen tonight
I just wanna fuck you in the candle light
I ain't rockin' Trues, like my jeans real tight
Like my pussy and my food teriyaki white rice, lil' bitch
I just need a goth queen tonight
I just wanna fuck you in the candle light
I ain't rockin' Trues, like my jeans real tight
Like my pussy and my food teriyaki white rice, lil' bitch
