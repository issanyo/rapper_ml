[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
With my goth bitch shopping
Pull up to the mall all she want is hot topic
Bitch I started than I'm stoppin'
I'm popular now it's funny how they top me cuz I'm poppin'

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I could move my own way (I could move my own way)
I could kill a whole team (I could kill a whole team)
I could make your best friend shake
I could call my plug I can have him be here by 8

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
I can eat a whole cake (I can eat a whole cake)
I can make a bad bitch vibrate
I'mma tat my whole face (I'mma tat my whole face)
I don't give a fuck what my mom say

[Verse 2: Boy Froot]
I don't give a fuck 'bout you (no, no, no, no)
At the club looking for an 02
Got shawty telling me she 'bout to come through
With my broadies Lil Peep, Boy Froot
Fuck what they think, fuck what they know
Girl what you drink, what? For sure
Spendin' these dollars, I'm out on the road
Smokin' that loud while I talk on the phone
Hittin' up my sidekick (prr, prr)
Bitch I think I'm psychic

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I could move my own way (I could move my own way)
I could kill a whole team (I could kill the whole team)
I could make your best friend shake
I could call my plug I can have her be here by 8
