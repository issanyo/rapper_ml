[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Lil Peep, Lil Tracy
Why everybody hatin' on us lately? (huh?)
Heard the GothBois crazy
Girls wanna rape me, boyfriends hate me
Fuck 'em though
Police hate me, everybody hate me, hate me
'Cause they ain't me and Lil Tracy
Ex-girl hates me, old friends hate me
I'ma go crazy, where's Lil Tracy?

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
Have I ever had a nine to five? No I didn't
Got more money than a manager at Burger King
Bad bitch ride my dick like some new rims
Lil Peep pullin' money out the ATM
Yeah, they hate 'cause we get them hunnid, hunnid, hunnid
If it's no blue strips on my hunnid I don’t want it-want it

[Bridge: Lil Tracy]
Peep and Tracy in the castle
Bitches in the dungeon
Peep and Tracy in the castle
Bitches in the dungeon

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Lil Peep, Lil Tracy
Why everybody hate on us lately? (huh?)
Heard the GothBois crazy
Girls wanna rape me, boyfriends hate me
Fuck 'em though
Police hate me, everybody hate me, hate me
'Cause they ain't me and Lil Tracy
Ex-girl hates me, old friends hate me
I'ma go crazy, where's Lil Tracy?

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
Have I ever had a nine to five? No I didn't
Got more money than a manager at Burger King
Bad bitch ride my dick like some new rims
Lil Peep pullin' money out the ATM
Yeah, they hate 'cause we get them hunnid, hunnid, hunnid
If it's no blue strips on my hunnid I don’t want it-want it
