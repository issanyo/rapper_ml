[Intro: Sample from "It's a Wonderful Life"]
"What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want?
You, you want the moon?
Just say the word and I’ll throw a lasso around it and pull it down
Hey. That’s a pretty good idea
I’ll give you the moon, Mary"
"I'll take it"

[Verse]
Baby, I could give you the moon
You know he can't do what I do
Yeah, It's true
Girl, I think I'm dyin' real soon
We could die in my room
Me and you
Baby, I could give you the moon
You know he can't do what I do
Yeah, It's true
Girl, I think I'm dyin' real soon
We could die in my room
Me and you
I'ma keep you in mind
While I drive right by
Say goodbye to the nice guy
I'm wastin' my time
Givin' you rhymes
You gotta give me a dime
Before I do that again
And I ain't trippin', I'm high
In the trunk of the Benz
Is where my women reside
Where my women will die
I ain't got no friends
And I don't listen to y'all
I'm equipped for the fall
And the winter and all
When the summer come
I'ma have enough to get the fuck out
I could buy a truck and
Drive that motherfuckin' truck out (skrr)
Tryna buy luck
If you don't die that means you lucked out
I ain't tryna fuck
I see the moon and bug the fuck out

[Outro: Sample from "It's a Wonderful Life"]
"Mary, I know what I’m going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that
I’m shaking the dust of this crummy little town far behind and I’m going to see the world
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum. Then I’m coming back here and I’ll go to college and see what they know and then I’m going to build things
I’m going to build air fields. I’m going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high
I’m going to build bridges a mile long. Well, are you going to throw a rock?
Hey, that’s pretty good. What’d you wish, Mary?"
