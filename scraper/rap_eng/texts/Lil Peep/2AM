[Intro]
Yeah, it's two in the morning and I'm racing down the block now
And I'm screaming out your name hoping that you wanna come out

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's two in the morning and I'm racing down the block now
And I'm screaming out your name hoping that you wanna come out
'Cause guess what
'Cause I got two Henny bottles and I'm riding in that Benz Truck
Good white shawty and I do it for my lil' bruv
And they won't understand, this ain't what we had planned
We don't ever make plans, we just fuck and hold hands

[Verse]
Bitches on me, but I do not pay attention
I'm staying late like you got me in detention
And there ain't shit to do in this little hell
So won't you make my night and get high as hell?
With me, with me?
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't sleep (I can't fuckin' sleep)
They don't believe, don't believe in me
But you do for some reason
And I swear that I just can't hide it
But every time I talk it's silence
On your carpet floors we get so violent
'Til your legs get sore and you can't stay silent
And if my brothers need me then I'm slidin'
Diamonds wet, feel like Poseidon
And I don't feel right when you're not beside me
So if I go seek then girl, stop hiding

[Chorus]
'Cause it's two in the morning and I'm racing down the block now
And I'm screaming out your name hoping that you wanna come out
'Cause I got two Henny bottles and I'm riding in that Benz Truck
Good white shawty and I do it for my lil' bruv
And they won't understand, this ain't what we had planned
We don't ever make plans, we just fuck and hold hands
You know it's two in the morning and I'm racing down the block now
And I'm screaming out your name hoping that you wanna come out
'Cause guess what
'Cause I got two Henny bottles and I'm riding in that Benz Truck
Good white shawty and I do it for my lil' bruv
And they won't understand, this ain't what we had planned
We don't ever make plans, we just fuck and hold hands
We just fuck and hold hands
We don't ever make plans

[Outro]
We just fuck and hold hands
We don't ever make plans
Oh no, no
Uh, uh, uh, uh
