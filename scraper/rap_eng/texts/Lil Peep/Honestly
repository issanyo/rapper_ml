[Hook]
Do you remember when we were both sixteen?
You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams
And I'd do anything that you would ask from me
I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly, to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you

[Verse]
Do you remember when you didn't care 'bout me?
Now I'm your everything and I've got you on your knees
I got this little problem, I wanna make you bleed
"So what's the problem?" she said
"Baby, make me scream!"

[Hook 2]
I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly, to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you
Do you remember when we were both sixteen?
You had that shallow heart and I had those big dreams
And I'd do anything that you would ask from me

[Outro]
I would blow my brains out just for you
And honestly, to tell you the truth
I'd still blow my brains out just for you
