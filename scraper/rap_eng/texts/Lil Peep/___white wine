[Intro: Lil Peep]
No one by my side
'Til this pretty young white bitch hopped up in my ride
(Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Every night
(Lil Tracy, whaddup man)
Show her how I die
No one by my side (Yeah)
'Til the pretty young white bitch hopped up in my ride
(GothBoiClique)
Took her to the crib and I show her how I die
Every night
(Fuck, aye aye, fuck... bitch, damn)

[Chorus: Lil Peep & Lil Tracy]
I had no one by my side (no one by my side)
'Til this pretty young white bitch hopped up in my ride (yah, yah)
Took her to the crib and I show her how I die (how I die)
Every night, then I wake up and I'm still fuckin' high (I'm still high, yeah)
Lord why, Lord why do I gotta wake up?
More wine, more wine, baby, pour another cup (pour another cup)
Lord why, Lord why do I gotta wake up?
(More wine) more wine, more wine, (more wine) baby, pour another cup
Ayo

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
I just dropped a pill in my champagne
She said she love me, she don't even know my real name, yeah
Hoppin' out the Uber on a Friday
Gothic bitch her Gucci bag, got bags of cocaine, yah
I've been living life my way
I can't fuck with you if we weren't friends on Myspace
Lord why, Lord why, do I wanna die?
I'ma get a Maserati just to take my life inside
Baby, sip this wine, tell me are you down to ride?
'Cause when I get a castle I won't let no one inside
I'm so magical, my wrist glisten in your dreams
Skinny nigga up next, countin' guap with Lil Peep, yah
(Let's get it)

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I had no one by my side
'Til this pretty young white bitch hopped up in my ride
Took her to the crib and I show her how I die
Every night, then I wake up and I'm still fuckin' high
Lord why, Lord why do I gotta wake up?
More wine, more wine, baby pour another cup
Lord why, Lord why do I gotta wake up?
More wine, more wine, baby pour another cup
Ayo
