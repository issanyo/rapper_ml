[Chorus: Fleance & BOY FROOT]
When the club's all been emptied
And there's no one left to talk to
You know I think about you

[Verse 1: Fleance]
I try and tell myself that I'm not alone
But deep inside I know that I'm wrong
I let you slip away

[Chorus: Fleance & BOY FROOT]
When the club's all been emptied
And there's no one left to talk to
You know I think about you

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Big-big money
All I need, all I wanted was some big money
Gave you everything you want, I'm talkin' crib money
Only buy it if it's on, I'm a ghost hunter
Always feel like someone watchin'
Rip-rip-rippin' up the beat
Heart cold but my mind with the heat
Knees weak every time that I speak
Lil Peep, bitch, my work never free
I don't never leave, she come to me

[Chorus: Fleance & BOY FROOT]
When the club's all been emptied
And there's no one left to talk to
You know I think about you

[Verse 3: BOY FROOT]
Pull up in a foreign when I hit these streets
Angel wings, we soarin', FROOT and Lil Peep
Bitch, I'm finna glow up with my team
Diamonds and gold chains, I'm glistening
Shinin', stunnin' in my Gucci shades
Bitch it's 300, yeah, glo gang
I guess you could call me Goth Guccimane
I'm smokin' that thrax, bitch, I'm gettin' paid

[Chorus: Fleance & BOY FROOT]
When the club's all been emptied
And there's no one left to talk to
You know I think about you
