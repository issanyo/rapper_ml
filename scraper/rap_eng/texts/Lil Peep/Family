[Chorus: OMENXIII]
It's the prince
On my throne and I know I'm not alone
I got family on my back
Bitch, I'm blank to the bone
You got playas?
No you don't
You got cash?
No you don't
Put my blade to your soul
I'ma leave you chopped at throat
I'ma leave you on the road
In the dark
On your own
Ain't nobody gonna miss you if you step up in my zone
XLT's floatin' like a motherfuckin' ghost
I put Bubba on the rocks
I put blood on the snow

[Verse 1: OMENXIII]
They don't fuck with me
They just fuck with who fuck with me
Don't fuck who fuck with me
We'll fuck you up in your fuckin' sleep
You want a beat?
That's fifteen
You want a feature?
That's ten g's
My emotions are up for sale, so please don't ask me if I can scream
Aye
You had it
We had it
You got it
We got it
Death is a price, but life is a option
Your life is a life and your death is a promise
Lookin' for problems
Can't seem to solve 'em
Lookin' at me for a problem
You better hope I won't solve it
Promise I'll solve it
I don't see you in the mornin'
I promise I'll solve it

[Chorus: OMENXIII]
It's the prince
On my throne and I know I'm not alone
I got family on my back
Bitch, I'm blank to the bone
You got playas?
No you don't
You got cash?
No you don't
Put my blade to your soul
I'ma leave you chopped at throat
I'ma leave you on the road
In the dark
On your own
Ain't nobody gonna miss you if you step up in my zone
XLT's floatin' like a motherfuckin' ghost
I put Bubba on the rocks
I put blood on the snow

[Verse 2: LiL PEEP]
Can I feel
The flow
Make you switch
Attack the hip of your bitch
With my dick
That's a sure way to make her wet like a motherfuckin' mermaid
She heard me
I kicked her out
All my kush
All my piff and shit
Wazzup?
We get hot
On your lip
When you rip the cut
Am I die? Now my bitch..
My bitch hate my thotty and my thotty hate my bitch
We get bank (deposit)
I'm hot
I'm cold
I'm froze
Zero go straight to a hunnid
If you put hands on OMEN
I jump
The gun

[Chorus: OMENXIII]
It's the prince
On my throne and I know I'm not alone
I got family out my back
Bitch, I'm blank to the bone
You got playas?
No you don't
You got cash?
No you don't
Put my blade to your soul
I'ma leave you chopped at throat
I'ma leave you on the road
In the dark
On your own
Ain't nobody gonna miss you if you step up in my zone
XLT's floatin' like a motherfuckin' ghost
I put Bubba on the rocks
I put blood on the snow
