[Intro]
Lately i've been flexing hard on my ex
Baby i've been leaning hard on this Tech
I can see the scars on your neck
I can see the stars in your eyes

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
Lately i've been flexing hard on my ex
Baby i've been leaning hard in this tech
I can see the scars on your neck
And i can see the stars in your eyes
Right now you're the only thing on my mind
Got me rolling, sipping, smoking dope just to get me high
Baby i've been trying hard to get by
Baby girl trying hard just to get fly for me

[Verse 1: LiLPEEP]
She would die for me, ride for me
Spend a night with me, don't fight with me
She in the Beamer with me, two seater with me
Say she love me cause i know thats what she needed from me
My bitch bleeding for me, she never cheated on me
She wanna fuck with me forever when she fucking on me
Come and fuck with me, baby, I ain't fucking for free
Come and fuck with me, baby, come and fuck with a G
