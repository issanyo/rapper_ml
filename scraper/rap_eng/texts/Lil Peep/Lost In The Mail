[Verse 1: Ricky Hil]
For real (for real)
I ain't gonna care about what the future holds (future holds)
Why should I when its out of my control (my control)
Everybody wants me to change (wants me to change)
They don't know that I wanna stay the same
And the hospital tryna fix my brain (fix the brain)
Been to rehab and they tryna stop the change (fucking rehab)
Reactions I've been having from the pain (reactions)
I hope you home still, remember my name

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
This time imma leave my name, bitch I
Can't risk that, I can't risk that
This time imma break my back, and I
Can't risk that, I can't risk that
Bro put me on in and I did that
Shawty only want my fame but I hid that
Bro put me on in and I did that
Shawty only want my fame, only want my fame

[Verse 2: Ricky Hil]
I thought I said I can't do nothin' for ya (doing nothin' for you)
I thought I said I don't wanna see ya (don't wanna see ya)
Maybe one day later, I'll meet you there (I'll meet you there)
Not in heaven cause I don't plan on goin' there (don't plan on goin' there)
Baby girl, we've been treated unfair (treated unfair)
Sometimes I don't wanna be here (wanna be here)
Sometimes I don't wanna be there (not there)
I never thought I could make you care (make you care)
I never knew I was so unaware
Its the pain that you give me, bitch, I care barely

[Pre-Hook: Lil Peep]
I never thought, I could make you care
I could take you there
Baby, Imma take you there
I never thought, I could make you care
I could take you there
Baby, Imma take you there

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Front new lease, our letters of the way I felt, but
Lost in the mail
Just like everything you've ever tell me
Lost in the mail
All these messages, you've ever sent me
Lost in the mail, lost in the mail (holy fuâ€”)
