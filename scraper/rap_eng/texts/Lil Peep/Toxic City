[Intro: Lil Peep & Bones]
Alright, lemme go
SESH

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die, I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker, I'll be ready for him

[Verse: Lil Peep & Bones]
Got your glass slippers on, lookin' like you're Cinderella
Girl, what you sippin' on? Room spinnin' like propellers
Boy, what you trippin' on? I will make these pussies jealous
Watch your girl sing along, say she want an acapella
I could give you what you want 'til my body in the mud
King of the fuckin' swamp, name a drug, I got the plug
Shawty say my house is haunted, I say I don't give a fuck
Somethin's watchin' over me, see me smoke a million (SESH)
Drunk kickin', dutch lickin', he said he can't fuck with me
Fuck this and fuck with me, I'ma take your luck with me
Bitch, what the fuck it do?
TeamSESH drippin' on the 1s and the 2s
Fuck your crew and fuck you too
Edge of the swamp, know the truck go through

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die, I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker, I'll be ready for him
