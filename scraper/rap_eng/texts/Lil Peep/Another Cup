[Chorus: Drippin So Pretty]
I've got the angel of death watching over my back
She know I'm too slick, I outlive heart attacks
I swear she don't love me, she in love with my racks
I got the angel of death telling me to fall back
I've got the angel of death watching over my back
She know I'm too slick, I outlive heart attacks
I swear she don't love me, she in love with my racks
I got the angel of death telling me to fall back

[Verse 1: Drippin So Pretty]
I love taking narcotics by the teaspoon
I love fucking her good in her mom's room
She say she in love with me but I don't believe her
Feeling so lonely, please tell me don't need her
Girl pick your poison is it me or is it drugs?
I know it's hard baby 'cause we both give you a rush
But a rush ain't love, it's temporary lust
I don't wanna die so pour another cup

[Chorus: Drippin So Pretty]
I've got the angel of death watching over my back
She know I'm too slick, I outlive heart attacks
I swear she don't love me, she in love with my racks
I got the angel of death telling me to fall back

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
I've got the angel of death watching over my back
I swear she don't love me, she in love with my act
I swear she wanna fuck me, why she do me like that
Why you do me like that, so I just do me like that, aye
Yeah I feel comfy when you do me like that, aye
You made me feel ugly when you do me like that, aye
I pull up to the function and I pop me a cap
I'm finna pop me some tags, I cop my bitches some bags, aye
Shopping mall shorty, I got dope in my bag, aye
I pull up to the party, I ain't trying to brag, aye
I pull up to the party, everybody get mad
And when I pull off from the party, all the bitches get sad
They saying, "where you going Lil Peep?"
I got lots of drugs on me
I think I'ma go to sleep
Wake up and I repeat (aye)
