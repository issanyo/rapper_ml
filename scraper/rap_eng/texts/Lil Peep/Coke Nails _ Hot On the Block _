Lyrics from video / live snippets

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Rock with me, baby
I might take you to the block with me, baby
Rock-Rock with me—Rock with me
Rock with me, baby
I might take you to the block with me, baby
Block-Block with me—Block with me
Block with me, baby
Got ya breakin' down the rock with me, baby
Ro-Rock with me—Rock with me
Rock with me, baby
I might take you to the block with me, baby
Rock, rock with me, baby, rock

[Verse 1: BEXEY]
I'ma tell you what you need from me
I'm in, do what I can
Yeah, you better believe in me
I just wanna know who I am
I remember holdin' hands tight
Then I felt tricks fall out your sleeve
Going 'round town then I picked your fit
With a mouthful of Hennessey, GothBoi Gang bust the energy
And she tripping off Chanel and coke nails, I think I wanna take 'em
Make her eyes roll back, kinda like the Undertaker
No attachments, like I'm cutting jewelry, no going
Watch what happens, during the nights, yeah, just let car riders
(Woo!) Head above the window, bitch, who want it?
So many damn trees, I'm buzzing
Like a [?] money, woah
Head above the window, who want it?
And you don't want me back in college
Now you want me, but stop it, don't touch me

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Rock with me, baby
I might take you to the block with me, baby
Rock-Rock with me—Rock with me
Rock with me, baby
I might take you to the block with me, baby
Block-Block with me—Block with me
Block with me, baby
Got ya breakin' down the rock with me, baby
Ro-Rock with me—Rock with me
Rock with me, baby
I might take you to the block with me, baby
Rock-Rock with me, baby—Rock

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Coke nails, she got coke nails, and I can't tell
If she want me, or my friend, fuck it, oh well
Now she sucking me, GB company
Fuck with me, she fucking me
In that DoubleTree, fuck it, oh well
OxyContin, Xanax bars, Lortabs, and Percocet
I got all of that, I feel like Lil' Wyte, no respect
Give me neck, smokin' cigarettes, free Biggavel
I just pulled up in that "vroom-vroom," kiss this tail (Skrrt!)
That's a all black Lambo (Bitch)
I ain't talkin' shit less I'm comin' like I'm Rambo (Bitch)
Fucking on yo' bitch, then I'm switchin' through the channels (Bitch)
Fucking on yo' bitch, then I'm switchin' through the channels (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt!)
That's a all black Lambo

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Rock with me, baby
I might take you to the block with me, baby
Rock-Rock with me—Rock with me
Rock with me, baby
I might take you to the block with me, baby
Block-Block with me—Block with me
Block with me, baby
Got ya breakin' down the rock with me, baby
Ro-Rock with me—Rock with me
Rock with me, baby
I might take you to the block with me, baby
Rock-Rock with me, baby—Rock
