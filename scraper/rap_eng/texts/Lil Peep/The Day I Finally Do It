[Chorus: BOY FROOT]
Today's the day that I end it all
I watch the sun as it rise, as it falls
Put down the gun because I'm getting a call
What have I become? Girl, I feel so small
Today's the day that I end it all
I watch the sun as it rise, as it falls
Put down the gun because I'm getting a call
What have I become? Why do I feel so small?

[Bridge: BOY FROOT]
Why do I feel so small? (Feel so small)
I want to end it all (I want to end it all)

[Verse: Lil Peep]
Lately I've been feelin' like I'm somebody else
I ain't savin' bitches if I can't save myself
Gone off the Xans right now, need some help
If I O.D. then I'm goin' to Hell
I don't fear nothin' but God
But God don't exist, not at all where I'm from
I don't play nothin' but C.O.D
Not at all, I don't play
Keepin' it real, that's my job
I'm in the V.I.P., I got your girl on my blow
BOY FROOT, Lil Peep, we takin' your ho
I'm takin' it slow in my zone
Took a couple pills when I woke up, now I'm stoned
Now I'm glowed up, thinkin' 'bout some dope with my bros
If I blow up, I'ma put the shotty to my dome
Turn the song up

[Chorus: BOY FROOT]
Today's the day that I end it all
I watch the sun as it rise, as it falls
Put down the gun because I'm getting a call
What have I become? Why do I feel so small?
