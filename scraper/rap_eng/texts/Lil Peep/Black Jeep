Gotta bad white girl with me (Yuh, yuh)
Gotta bad black girl with me (Yuh)

[Chorus - Lil Peep]
Ripped black jeans in a all black jeep
And I got a couple black girls on me
And I got a couple white girls on me
And I got a couple tight girls on me (Aye)
Ripped black jeans in a all black jeep
And I got a couple black girls on me
And I got a couple white girls on me
And I got a couple tight girls on me (Yuh)

[Verse 1 - Lil Peep]
Met Gotti in a white beam
We was prolly sippin' on lean (Yuh)
She was prolly thinking bout me ('Bout me)
I was prolly thinkin' bout cheese ('Bout cheese)
I was prolly thinkin' bout bros ('Bout bros)
I be on the road doing shows (Doing shows)
I be on the road fuckin' hoes (Fuckin' hoes)
This my life and that's just how it goes (That's just how it goes)
This my life I'm always on the road (Always on the road)
I got addictions (I got addictions)
They got me trippin' (Got me trippin')

[Chorus - Lil Peep]
Ripped black jeans in a all black jeep

[Verse 2 - Mackned]
You're always on my nerves and you always have been
Drop the beat and let 'em sing the lyrics on my last bitch
Ying Yang bitches mixed up like emotions
My life is a funeral I'm the reason you show up
I remember pain flowin' through your voice when
You found out I don't love you, I love choices
I don't ever fall asleep, I can't find sleep
Me and Lil Tracy th-th-th-th-that's the nigga
Selling dog food so I know you catching boy bands
[?] swingin' from the trees my niggas call 'em Tarzan
I don't ever think I drove without contraband
GBC I'm ridin' for my doggies like a Triad (Mackned)

[Chorus - Lil Peep]
Ripped black jeans in a all black jeep
And I got a couple black girls on me
And I got a couple white girls on me
And I got a couple tight girls on me (Aye)
Ripped black jeans in a all black jeep
And I got a couple black girls on me
And I got a couple white girls on me
And I got a couple tight girls on me (Yuh)

[Verse 3 - Cold Hart]
Black rain
Locked doors
Can't ask, for more
Can I sleep on your floor?
Black clothes on tour
Mackned and Lil Peep
GBC punkstars
I don't think I'll ever need to go back to sleep
You will never know what you really meant to me
Rip my jeans, split my pills into three's
For me, please, baby can you help me bleed?
Nobody, yeah nobody
Can make me feel like you do
Nobody, yeah nobody
Baby life ain't fair, and I know I ain't there

[Chorus - Lil Peep]
Ripped black jeans in a all black jeep
And I got a couple black girls on me
And I got a couple white girls on me
And I got a couple tight girls on me (Aye)
Ripped black jeans in a all black jeep
And I got a couple black girls on me
And I got a couple white girls on me
And I got a couple tight girls on me (Yuh)
