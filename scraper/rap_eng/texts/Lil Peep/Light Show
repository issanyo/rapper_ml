[Verse]
Fighting the feeling
Tired of fighting the feeling, it's causing me pain
I play the villain, said I play the villain in your little game, aye
She told me I'm killin
She telling me I have been killin the whole fucking game
I'm just a feeling, said I'm just a feeling they needed today, aye

[Hook]
I can make a light show (I can make a light show)
She said I can make the night glow easy (easy)
Tell me what you'd fight for (tell me what you'd fight for)
Tell me if I might seem greedy (seem greedy)
I can make a light show (I can make a light show)
She said I can make the night glow easy (easy)
Tell me what you'd fight for (tell me what you'd fight for)
Tell me if I might seem greedy (seem greedy)
