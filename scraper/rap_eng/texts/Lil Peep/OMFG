[Intro]
Kill myself
My life is goin' nowhere
I want everyone to know that I don't...

[Hook]
I used to wanna kill myself
Came up, still wanna kill myself
My life is goin' nowhere
I want everyone to know that I don't care
I used to wanna kill myself
Came up, still wanna kill myself
My life is goin' nowhere
I want everyone to know that I don't care

[Verse]
Babygirl, you got nothin' on her
You're the only one that could ever compare
I can't hear what you're tryin' to say
Club lights shinin' on the side of your face
Cocaine love, it goes straight to your brain
Why the fuck is everybody the same?
Fuck my life, tell that bitch I'm insane
Lil Peep, shawty, let me silence your pain

[Hook]
I used to wanna kill myself
Came up, still wanna kill myself
My life is goin' nowhere
I want everyone to know that I don't care
I used to wanna kill myself
Came up, still wanna kill myself
My life is goin' nowhere
I want everyone to know that I don't care

[Bridge]
Babygirl, you got nothin' on her
You're the only one that could ever compare
I can't hear what you're tryin' to say
Club lights shinin' on the side of your face
