[Hook]
She ain't looking for love tonight
I guess that I'm not the one tonight
But she know that I can do it right
Bet she know that I'ma do it right

[Verse]
Got me high on the floor for you
Baby, I wanted more for you
Now you got it, you can never leave
Black clothes in your darkest dreams
Ripped jeans in my fantasy
Looking through you, when you look at me
Now she geekin', she ain't never sleep
I've been geekin' for a couple weeks
I could really use your company
Cause everybody wanna fuck with me
Lately everybody wanna fuck with me
I'm on the edge, will you jump with me?
