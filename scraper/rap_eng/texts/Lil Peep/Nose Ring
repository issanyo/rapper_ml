We had all of it planned out
Baby girl, what the fuck is the plan now? (What's the plan now?)
We had all of it planned out
Baby girl, who the fuck is your man now?
We had all of it planned out
Baby girl, what the fuck is the plan now? (What's the plan now?)
We had all of it planned out
Baby girl, who the fuck is your man now?

[Verse]
Hellboy, baby, I stand out
Go to hell, boy, bitch, I got bands now
I'm about to throw it all away, just to see you today
I tat your name on my face
Love me, baby, it's okay
You don't love me, you in love with the gold chain (Gold chain)
Fuck me, baby, it's okay
All I do is young bitches and cocaine (Cocaine)
Shined up, baby, it is no shame
Watch your bitch throw it back while you're throwin' shade
Lined up, lookin' like Cobain
Drugs drippin' off of my nose ring
Lil Peep, bitch, I'm a no name
But it's a lot of shit that I don't say
Like I been on my hustle through the whole way
I ain't never quittin', there's no way
I know you see me makin' my own lane
Hellboy, I'm killin' the whole game
