[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Blunt in my right hand
Hand cup in my left
My gun on the night stand
While we ducking the feds
Where did the time go?
Can't nobody waste time like me (Waste time like me...)
Where did my mind go?
Did somebody call me lime-lite peep (Peep..Peep..)
But puttin my love to the side
I don't have the time
I spend it gettin high I
Lookin for love and all you find is
You make em all cry make em all wanna die I
Where did the time go can't nobody waste time like me
Waste time like me
Shut up and vibe ho well let me die while I smoke my weed
While I smoke my weed

[Verse 2: Bath Salt Bryce]
I ain't got no time too busy on my grind
Just tryna make it out this city alive..
I cannot die till my momma living right, so I'm up  all night
Money on my mind and i'm still tryna do what's right...
I swear I try
I swear I try
I swear I try....
I'm the last of a dying kind Henney got me walking like i'm blind But
I Promise i'll be fine.. I promise I'll be fine..
Where did the time go can't nobody waste time like me?
Where did the time go can't nobody waste time like me?
I wanna die hoe
Please just let me be...
