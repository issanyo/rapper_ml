[Intro]
The fuck is that?

[Hook: Shakewell]
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm still packin shakes
Like all my motherfuckin scrubs
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm still packin shakes
Like all my motherfuckin scrubs
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm still packin shakes
Like all my motherfuckin scrubs
Now hit the pit and fuck it up

[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
Pull up stuntin', do no cardio, my diamonds dance
2-2-4, we shoot 'em, give no fucks, gonna smoke his ass
Rick Owens, toe stepping
Dropping bands, yeah, rich and reckless
I just bought some VVSes, crumb [?] my necklace
Bitch I know to hold uzi hold a fucking hundred rocks
I drink syrup, I pop percs
I'm breaking hearts, I'm rich and bold
All designer head to toe, your main bitch loving me
Snort a roxy, then pop three, swept me off my feet
Tip toe, Margiela prints on all my floors
10K, neck froze
All these hollows, let 'em go
30 in my shit, extended dick, gon' let it rip
I don't give a fuck, piece of shit, just rest in piss

[Hook: Shakewell]
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm still packin-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm still packin shakes
Like all my motherfuckin scrubs
Now hit the pit and fuck it up
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm still packin shakes
Like all my motherfuckin scrubs
Now hit the pit and fuck it up

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Blood on my wrist
You don't give your bitch shit
I got love for your bitch
I got mud for your bitch
Blood on my wrist
You don't give your bitch shit
I got love for your bitch
I got mud for your bitch, aye
Lil Peep shawty, bitch I feel like Fat Nick, aye
Lil Peep shawty, I got diamonds on my lip
I got hoes on my dick, I need rims on my whip
Bitch, I cry every night and I'm pretty like a bitch (woo)
Pretty like a bitch on my Based World shit, aye
Shout out Lil B, I can never be a snitch, aye
Shout out to the bay, and the south, Triple 6
Yelling "Fuck Donald Trump"
He ain't really with the shits

[Hook: Shakewell]
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm still packin-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm still packin shakes
Like all my motherfuckin scrubs
Now hit the pit and fuck it up
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm-
While I sip designer drugs
And I'm still packin shakes
Like all my motherfuckin scrubs
Now hit the pit and fuck it up
