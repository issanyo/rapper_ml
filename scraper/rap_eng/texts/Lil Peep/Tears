[Intro]
You were nothing more to me
Than when you loved me in my dreams
Still dreamin' about you
You know I'm crazy about you
You know I'm crazy about you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I remember the first time
Baby, this is the last time
You were nothing more to me
Than when you loved me in my dreams
Still dreamin' about you
You know I'm crazy about you
There is nothing more to me than you
I died that day you left my room in tears

[Verse]
This is the last time
Me and you are a past time
Both wish this didn't have to end like...
This is the last time
Me and you are a past time
And I know that you and I both wish this didn't have to end like this
But, it's that time
Put the kid on the map time
I just finished the last line
Can't believe it's the last night, the last fight with you

[Chorus]
I remember the first time
Baby, this is the last time
You were nothing more to me
Then when you loved me in my dreams
Still dreamin' about you
You know I'm crazy about you
There is nothing more to me than you
I died that day you left my room in tears
