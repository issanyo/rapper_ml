Whip it like a Nascar, I can see the time pass
Feel like I’m in high school, fucking me in gym class
Shawty, I remember that
I know you remember that
You was fucking with me way before I even wrote raps
Now I’m seeing cash flow
I could be a asshole
Yeah, I know
But it’s all good cause I let her spend my money though
Playboy bunny though, shawty look like a fucking pornstar
But we really goin far
Shawty shinnin like a gleamin star
Takin bars
Yeah i'm Passin out
I️ miss her
I Really wanna fucking kiss her
Makes me really happy
Just like ridin in the fisker
Not naughty but I’ll fist her
I’ll give her
All the love I️ mother fuckin better
Together

Maybe i been tripping
The lsd just kicked
You just want my mention
Satan gave me a mission
I can't let him down now
I can't let him down now
So you dont want to smoke
But smoke when its your own
I️ just wanna die now
Cousins ain’t alive now
Granny ain’t dead now
What is next
Maybe I️ should just close my eyes now
No one fucking likes me now
People changing around the town
I just wanna wear a crown
