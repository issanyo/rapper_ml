[Hook: Fat Nick]
All of these perkys don't save me
All of these xannys don't save me
All of this codeine don't save me
Choking on sorrow, yeah, reaper just take me
Please, don't you save me
Hoe, don't you save me
P.S., I love you
P.S., I hate you
Please, don't you save me
All of these perkys don't save me
All of these xannys don't save me
All of this codeine don't save me
Choking on sorrow, yeah, reaper just take me
Please, don't you save me
Hoe, don't you save me
P.S., I love you
P.S., I hate you
Please, don't you save me

[Verse 1: Fat Nick]
Emotionless, I'm standin' here
Dameon is takin' him
We don't regret the sins we've made
I overdose to cover pain
She left me here and slit my heart
I can't see light, I turn it dark
These rope burns be my beauty marks
Said ain't shit sweet, my life is tart
Please don't love me
Don't get close
I can't show you this side of me
I'm burnin' up, I'm next to death
They want me for eternity
All this frenzy clothing money cover up my true feelings
On the verge of suicide, my knot at throat mono cry
My VVS's shinin', Margiela shoes I'm tryin'
Bitch, I'm hot as fuck
I just want more money pilin'
Some milligrams I'm wylin'
Ten toes down, I'm grounded
Perkys wash away some pain and got my brain cells fryin'
Drip, watch me come
You a crumb, I'm rich and young
Skrting off, fast as fuck
You a hater, broke as fuck
I just need me all this
You can't get me all this
Look what you created
Take a shot, I hope you don't miss

[Hook: Fat Nick]
All of these perkys don't save me
All of these xannys don't save me
All of this codeine don't save me
Choking on sorrow, yeah, reaper just take me
Please, don't you save me
Hoe, don't you save me
P.S., I love you
P.S., I hate you
Please, don't you save me
All of these perkys don't save me
All of these xannys don't save me
All of this codeine don't save me
Choking on sorrow, yeah, reaper just take me
Please, don't you save me
Hoe, don't you save me
P.S., I love you
P.S., I hate you
Please, don't you save me

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
I just wanna close my eyes and never wake up tonight
I just wanna make you mine, gettin' high in the candlelight
Baby, I just poured an eight in that two-liter Sprite
Fuck it, I'll be fine
I just dropped a couple green pills in my Sprite, baby I'll be fine
And fuck it, if I die, it was by your side
Hold me closer, I can't be your man
I don't think you understand, It's obvious to me I wasn't in the plan
Never sober, I can't be your man
I don't think you understand
It's obvious to me you want my rubberbands
