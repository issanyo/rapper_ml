[Verse 1: SOWHATIMDEAD]
We pullin' up in hologram Elantras
They askin' if we fuckin' with 'em, nada
I'm skatin' off the scene, I'm with your daughter
This is my money, don't ask what I bought her
Brought her to the slaughter, girl, she think she gettin' Prada
All I really wanted was it wetter than the water
I'm divin' off the boat, so call the doctor
They see my face and now they know he proper
I ain't wanna do it but right now you know I gotta
Trippin' on me, awnry, like she took a hit of blotter
Caught her in the back with me while we was sippin' Vodka
Just let me do my rep, don't need no spotter
I'm up in this bitch, I'm solo, boy, don't need no squad, ah
Trappin' out the school, I'm boolin', drugs up in my locker
There ain't no gettin' through to me, don't bother
This is my moment mane, don't try to block us

[Verse 2: LiL PEEP]
I used to dream about a pink Impala
22's up on that bitch, I want it sittin' proper
I want a mansion for my baby momma
Now they want me 'cause I'm gettin' gwalla
I can't work, lil bitch, I'm tatted out my fuckin' collar
She wanna fuck me 'cause I rap, I ain't no fuckin scholar
You got nothin' on me, bitch, I'm God, uh
Poppin', I grew up without my father
Now she callin' me her fuckin' father
That's your girl? She on my dick, I do not see the problem
It ain't shit that you could do to bother
I'm a junkie and my bitch a model
