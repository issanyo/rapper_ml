[Intro]
Cry alone right now
I just did a line of blow right now
I don't wanna cry alone right now
Kissing on styrofoam right now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna cry alone right now
Kissing on styrofoam right now
I don't wanna die alone right now
I just did a line of blow right now
I don't wanna cry alone right now
Kissing on styrofoam right now
I don't wanna die alone right now
I just did a line of blow right now

[Verse 1]
I hate everybody in my hometown
I wanna burn my old high school into the ground
I hate everybody in my hometown
Tell the rich kids to look at me now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna cry alone right now
Kissing on styrofoam right now
I don't wanna die alone right now
I just did a line of blow right now

[Verse 2]
When I fly back to my hometown
I feel like everybody hate me in my hometown
I hate everybody in my hometown
Tell the rich kids to look at me now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna cry alone right now
Kissing on styrofoam right now
I don't wanna die alone right now
I just did a line of blow right now

[Bridge]
When I fly back to my hometown
I feel like everybody hate me in my hometown
I hate everybody in my hometown
Tell the rich kids to look at me now
I hate everybody in my hometown
I wanna burn my old high school into the ground
I hate everybody in my hometown
Tell the rich kids to look at me now

[Outro]
I really hate it when I cry alone out loud
I really hate it when I cry alone out loud
