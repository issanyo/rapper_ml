[Verse 1: LIL PEEP]
Hold my breath
Wrap my arms around you
Now that I've found you
We're goin' to hell
I don't give no fucks bout where you're from
Let's have some fun tonight
Bitch, I'ma kill you
(kill you)
Bitch, I'ma make you scream in pain
OJ, I feel you
(feel you)
I'ma 'bout to kill my bitch today

[Chorus: LiL Peep]
Chain hangin' from my jeans
But you know that it's me
Blood drippin' on my feet
But I follow my dream
Hair bleached
Gold teeth
Yeah, you ain't on my team
Nose bleeds
White sheets
Schemaboys on the scene

[Verse 2: JGRXXN]
When the smoke clears
All you see is me
In my tee
Yo' bitch sees it too
So she looks to us
Like we cool
I invite her to my cushion
She think we gonna cuddle up
But, I'ma muzzle her
And sacrifice her
To the underworld

[Verse 3: GHOSTEMANE]
Gotta little place I keep
All of them chicks I meet
Fuck for the night, we sleep
Then she wake up in the trunk-?
Tell me she wanted to bang
Talkin' a hell of a game
All of these chicks
That all talk that shit
'Til they see blood on my blade
