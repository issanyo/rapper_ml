[Chorus:]
Yeah, I thought I had a feeling before
And now you're closin' the door
Because you don't want me comin' in
Yeah, I know I seen you before
Friday night at the store
You had another boy to hold your hand

[Verse:]
Okay, now I see ya, bitch
You want me to beat it, bitch?
I ain't finna beat it, no, no
She said "Why you so conceited, bitch?"
Yeah, I got my reasons, bitch
Why the fuck you geekin' hoe? Oh
Blood on the Nike swish
'Cause I had to bite the bitch
Blood steady leakin' hoe, oh
Shawty lookin' tasty though
Free Yung Bruh, Lil Tracy, hoe
I make shawty scream it, oh, oh
I'ma lil angel though
I can see your anger though
I just can't believe it bro, oh
She said, "I'm in danger" woah
I don't see no danger hoe
I'm the one that's creepin' hoe, oh
Maybe I'll see you at the strip club
Maybe I'll never see yo ass again
Maybe I'll see you when the gig's up (aye)
Why you fakin', why you playin' pretend?

[Chorus:]
Yeah, I thought I had a feeling before
And now you're closin' the door
Because you don't want me comin' in
Yeah, I know I seen you before
Friday night at the store
You had another boy to hold your hand

[Verse:]
Okay, now I see ya, bitch
You want me to beat it, bitch?
I ain't finna beat it, no, no
She said "Why you so conceited, bitch?"
Yeah, I got my reasons, bitch
Why the fuck you geekin' hoe? Oh
Blood on the Nike swish
'Cause I had to bite the bitch
Blood steady leakin' hoe, oh
Shawty lookin' tasty though
Free Yung Bruh, Lil Tracy, hoe
I make shawty scream it, oh, oh
I'ma lil angel though
I can see your anger though
I just can't believe it bro, oh
She said, "I'm in danger" woah
I don't see no danger hoe
I'm the one that's creepin' hoe, oh
Maybe I'll see you at the strip club
Maybe I'll never see yo ass again
Maybe I'll see you when the gig's up
Why you fakin', why you playin' pretend?
