[Verse: iLoveMakonnen]
Your guiltiness is weighing heavy
Cause second best for your love no I can't be
I'm not impressed so you can stop it
I wanna be the best for you and me
So can you put me online

[Hook: Lil Peep]
If we give it up now, you'll see, you were everything to me
If I give it up now, they'll say, you lost everything today
If we don't live it up now, no pain, you were always in my way
So I give it up now, lets pray, that we see another day

[Verse 2: iLoveMakonnen]
