[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Glo Gang tatted on my hand
She think I'm the man, I'm just stickin' to my plan
What's up BOY FROOT? What the fuck it do?
If she fuckin' me, then she fuckin' you too
Bitch I'm off a pill, nah, don't wanna chill
Turnin' up the music while I'm smokin' at the wheel
Tell me if you feel me, I don't need a deal
I got matte black nails, I got lots of sex appeal
Pothead bitch, yeah I smoke it by the zip
7 gram blunts, leave a gram in the clip
I don't give a shit, money ain't a thing
Money's what I make if you could make it rain
Brick Squad chain, free Gucci Mane
Sniffin' cocaine, pain's in my brain
Money migraine, fuck the rap game
I'ma make my own lane, make my own name

[Chorus: BOY FROOT]
Bitch, I'm turnin' up, bitch, I'm turnin' up
In the back of the club, bitch I'm turnin' up
Bitch, you know I'm turnin' up, bitch, I'm turnin' up
In the back of the club, bitch I'm turnin' up
Bitch, you know I'm turnin' up

[Verse 2: BOY FROOT]
Angels in the sky (angels in the sky)
Watch them fly right by (fly right by)
It's a waste of time (waste of time)
To worry when you're gonna die
Gucci on my team (on my team)
Goth girl of my dreams (of my dreams)
She's wearin' Tommy jeans (Tommy jeans)
She's always all on me (she's all on me)
Bitch, I'm in my zone (in my zone)
Please don't trip my phone (trip my phone)
I'll take the shawty home (take the shawty home)
And when the party's gone

[Chorus: BOY FROOT]
'Cause tonight I'm turnin' up, bitch, I'm turnin' up
In the back of the club, back of the club
'Cause tonight I'm turnin' up, bitch, I'm turnin' up
In the back of the club, back of the club
'Cause tonight I'm turnin' up, bitch, I'm turnin' up
In the back of the club, back of the club
'Cause tonight I'm turnin' up, bitch, I'm turnin' up
In the back of the club, back of the club
'Cause tonight I'm turnin' up

[Outro: BOY FROOT]
Bitch I'm turnin' up
I'm in the back of the club
I said, bitch I'm turnin' up
Back of the club
I said, bitch I'm turnin' up
I'm in the back of the club
