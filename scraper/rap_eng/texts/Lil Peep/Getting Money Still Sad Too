GothBoiClique

[Verse 1: Horse Head]
I wanna kill myself, but no one believes me
I just wanna be loved, why they gotta deceive me?
Get what they want, then they leave me
GothBoiClique
I just want you to see me, believe me
Honestly I'm the one and you need me, and I need you
It's transparent, it's see through
I'm gettin' money still sad too

[Hook: Lil Peep]
I'm gettin' money still sad too, I remember when I had you
I'm gettin' money still sad too, I remember when I had you, now I don't
I'm gettin' money still sad too, I remember when I had you
I'm gettin' money still sad too, I remember when I had you, now I don't

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
Now I know, I don't love you anymore
But if you show me a sign, if you show me a sign
Maybe I could find another reason to try
Now I know, now I know, I don't love you anymore
But if you show me a sign, if you show me a sign
Maybe I could find another reason to cry

[Verse 2: Horse Head]
You're the reason I try
You make me wanna die
I think you're so cute...
It kills me every time
And I got a death wish, so I wanna make you mine
I think it's a sign that when the stars align
GothBoiClique, in the black Benz truck
I don't give a fuck

[Hook: Lil Peep]
I'm gettin' money still sad too, I remember when I had you
I'm gettin' money still sad too, I remember when I had you, now I don't
I'm gettin' money still sad too, I remember when I had you
I'm gettin' money still sad too, I remember when I had you, now I don't
