[Hook: Lil Peep]
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up, we'll leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down

[Post-Hook: Lil Peep]
She said she ain't never comin' back
She ain't never comin' back
I ain't never comin' back bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Now they wanna put me on a track
Can't put me on a track
Can I put you on my tracklist?
I'd rather watch you bleed to death
(I'd rather watch you bleed to death)
Than
See you leave just like the rest
(See you leave just like the rest)
Damn

[Verse 2: Yung Goth]
Lately, I've been dyin' lately
I've been dyin' lately
I've been dyin' lately
Lately, lately, lately
I've been dyin' lately
I've been dyin' lately
I've been dyin' lately, lately, lately
I've been dyin' lately
Gettin' high lately
Gettin' high lately
Lately, baby
Please donâ€™t worry, baby
Always tryna blame me
You ain't tryna save me
Save me, lately
Gettin' high, tasty
Now I'm on that lame shit
I've been dyin' lately
Lately, baby

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Pick me up, pick me up and drive around
Pick me up, pick me up, and leave this town
Pistol on my side when she's not around
Bitch I, bitch I wanna die when you throw it down

[Post-Hook: Lil Peep]
She said she ain't never comin' back
She ain't never comin' back
I ain't never comin' back bitch
