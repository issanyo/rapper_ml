[Verse]
I can't feel that much sometimes
These drugs could kill me, yeah
Disappear into my mind where I can't feel a thing
When the sky falls down, and no one here can think that clearly
I'll be by your side, let's get high, just one last time
I don't wanna stop now, I don't wanna stop now
But, I gotta leave it alone
Is it 'cause I'm hot now? It's prolly 'cause I'm hot now
Bitch, you better leave me alone
First, I cut you off, then I cut you down
Shit go off, when I come around
I don't never come around
Bitch, I'm gettin' hunnit's now
I don't wanna stop now, I don't wanna stop now
But, I gotta leave it alone
Is it 'cause I'm hot now? It's prolly 'cause I'm hot now
Bitch, you better leave me alone
First, I cut you off, then I cut you down
Shit go off, when I come around
Shit go off, when I come around
Shit go off, when I come around
Shit go off, when I come around
