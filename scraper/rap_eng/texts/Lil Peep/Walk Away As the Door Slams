[Pre-Chorus: Lil Peep]
Club lights, we fight every night
Baby, I don't wanna do that
Your type, jeans tight, dirty Sprite
She like "how the fuck you do that?"
I can't be there all the time
But you know I gotta prove that
I can't leave here anytime soon
I got somethin' to do, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Walk away as the door slams
You got blood on your poor hands
I just wanted to help, now I'm goin' to hell
Walk away as the door slams

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
I know you wanna FaceTime, baby, I have Samsung
When I met your mom, she told me I was handsome
You told me I'm sexy, do you still think that?
You told me you loved me, do you still think that?
3AM, climbin' through your window
Ounce of the kush, blowin' smoke out your window
You're a thousand miles away, I snort a thousand lines
Step inside the club, cameras flashin' in my eyes
3AM, climbin' through your window
Ounce of the kush, blowin' smoke out your window
You're a thousand miles away, I snort a thousand lines
Step inside the club, cameras flashin' in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Peep]
Club lights, we fight every night
Baby, I don't wanna do that
Your type, jeans tight, dirty Sprite
She like "how the fuck you do that?"
I can't be there all the time
But you know I gotta prove that
I can't leave here anytime soon
I got somethin' to do, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Walk away as the door slams
You got blood on your poor hands
I just wanted to help, now I'm goin' to hell
Walk away as the door slams
