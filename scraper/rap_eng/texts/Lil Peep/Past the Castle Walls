[Hook: Lil Peep]
Left my world behind for you
I just hope you find the truth inside of you
Left the drugs behind for you
I can't help you make it through, that's what I do
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Go

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
Here we go again, wakin' up again
I know a lot of shit, but I don't know what day it is
I really like you, but I'ma die fast
So you should run away, and don't look back
Castle love, bloodstained rug
My face tatted up baby I don't give a fuck
Back of the club switchblade tucked
Vampire mix the champagne with the blood
I was wide awake, you were havin' a nightmare
You said you think that you're in Hell, I'll catch a flight there
I'll be right there, for you
Castle love, bloodstained rug
My face tatted up, baby, I don't give a fuck
Back of the club switchblade tucked
Vampire mix the champagne with the blood

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Left my world behind for you
I just hope you find the truth inside of you
Left the drugs behind for you
I can't help you make it through, that's what I do
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Past the castle walls I hear you callin' for me
Maybe after all, I fear you're wantin' more of me
Go
