[Intro: Lil Peep]
Pull up
Pull the fuck up
You ain't finna pull up

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Put on my chains and I walk out the house
It's a beautiful day and I'm glad I made it out
I'll be okay on my own, I'll be straight (I'll be straight)
Get out the way, get the fuck up out my way
Get out my face, out my face, out my face (out my face)
Stay in your lane, in your mothafuckin' lane (in your lane)
He wanna sing, tryna be like Lil Peep (fuck with me)
She wanna sing, tryna suck Lil Peep

[Verse: BOY FROOT]
She callin' my phone, but I ain't pickin' up
'Cause I'm in my zone in the mothafuckin' club
Strappin' my chain to my wallet and my belt
I've been the same since a jit, could you tell?
Takin' your bitch with the cast of a spell
Hittin' a lick in the back by myself
Testin' these fools tryna fuck with me
Get out my face, bitch, boy, would you please
Fuck up out my face, bitch
Get the fuck up out my face, bitch

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Put on my chains and I walk out the house
It's a beautiful day and I'm glad I made it out
I'll be okay on my own, I'll be straight
Get out the way, get the fuck up out my way
Get out my face, out my face, out my face
Stay in your lane, in your mothafuckin' lane
