[Intro: Lil Tracy]
Let's get it...
I don't wanna die in L.A...
I don't wanna die in L.A...

[Hook: Smokeasac]
I love when I'm getting fucked up
But I don't wanna die alone this way
I don't wanna overdose today
I don't wanna die out in L.A
I don't wanna die alone this way
You promised me that you would fucking stay
And I just like the way you'll feel that pain
I swear that Imma die alone today

[Verse 1: LiL PEEP]
I don't wanna die alone this way
Read the tattoos on my face
I'mma die young but I get cake
I spend it on the drugs and act okay

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
I don't wanna overdose in L.A
Cocaine, champagne
I don't wanna overdose in L.A
Love Gang, baby, I don't wanna die today

[Hook: Smokeasac]
I love when I'm getting fucked up
But I don't wanna die alone this way
I don't wanna overdose today
I don't wanna die out in L.A
I don't wanna die alone this way
You promised me that you would fucking stay
And I just like the way you'll feel that pain
I swear that Imma die alone today
