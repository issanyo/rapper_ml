[Verse 1]
Layin' on my back now
Lay another track down
Brought the Black cats out, bad luck
If you wanna snap now, try not take a cap now
Bring the black cats out, now you're fucked
Watch out for the pigs while I ride real slow
Smokin' thraxx, read my tats from the backseat
Why you throwin' shade like you finna phase me
You a ho ass bitch, need a Maxi
Half of your pussy blood dripping down your skinny's
I could serve you for some 20's but my racks free
Young bitch, I got plenty, on my bottle it say "Remy", on my belt
That shit say Fendi and the back green (bling)

[Chorus]
Got me talkin' bout my clothes girl
When I fall won't you pick me up
I'm talkin' bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's somethin' in the bud, man, I need a new plug (plug)
I feel it in my veins
All my bitches dumb 'cause they give me all their brains

[Verse 2]
Put me on the map now
I could hold a map down
See me in the background
Rolling up
I don't gotta rap loud
Bitch, I got that trap sound
Autotune my strap with the Cobra Clutch
Watch out for the bitch in the black Range Rover
Drivin' fast when she listenin' to Max B
Got the tats on her ass and the black ski mask in the back
If you tryna get your ass beat
One for the money blow
Two for the show, my flow go perfect with a sad beat
Everywhere I go all I ever see is snow
In the summertime, pussy make me happy

[Outro]
Got me talkin' bout my clothes girl
Won't you pick me up
I'm talkin' bout my old girl
When I call she don't pick it up
My head hurt from the drugs
It's somethin' in the bud man, I need a new plug
I feel it in my veins
