[Chorus]
Meet me at the mall
We could blow a bag
I'm about to ball
On my ex like I'm mad
Meet me at the mall
She ain't comin' back
Imma spend it all
Then I pull off in the jag
Meet me at the mall
We could blow a bag
I'm about to ball
On my ex poppin tags
Meet me at the mall
She ain't comin back
Imma spend it all
I know I can make it back

[Bridge]
She don't ever wanna grow up
I don't ever wanna grow up, now
Gettin' money like a grown up
Everybody said I glo'd up now
She don't ever wanna grow up
I don't ever wanna grow up, now
Gettin' money like a grown up
Everybody said I glo'd up now

[Chorus]
Meet me at the mall
We could blow a bag
I'm about to ball
On my ex like I'm mad
Meet me at the mall
She ain't comin' back
Imma spend it all
And I pull off in the jag
Meet me at the mall
We could blow a bag
I'm about to ball
On my ex poppin tags
Meet me at the mall
She ain't comin back
Imma spend it all
I know I can make it back
