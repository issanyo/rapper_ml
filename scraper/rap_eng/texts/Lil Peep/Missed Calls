[Hook: Lil Peep]
I don't want to say it but I had to
Good drugs on me but I'm bad news
Goth boy clique in the back too
Got a tattoo baby cuz I had to, missed call
All black Benz smokin' gas too
I'm a hurt you bad till I have you
I'm a have you, baby I'm a have you, all mine
I would take a life for you if I had to

[Verse: Mackned]
Say I got her mind racing like a track meet
And my niggas blunt facing on the back street
Goth boy clique in the back room
Take a sip of this, it change your attitude
Kurt Cobeezy in the streets, there ain't no substitutes
Kurt Cobeezy, foreign mansion with a prostitute
Is there heaven for a thug?
Is there heaven for you?
Therapy for me? is gettin' hit with tattoo's
I'm a goth boy but I keep a strap too
Goth boy baby yea I had to
All the racks and recognition all overdue
When the xanny hit my system, I'm so over you
When the perc hit my system I'm so over you
Made a promise to my niggas I'm a see it through
Big body dripping on them all white, all white
Like that good she playing with all night, all night yeah

[Outro: Lil Peep]
Rain falls, missed calls
Rain falls, missed calls
Rain falls, missed calls
Rain falls, missed calls
