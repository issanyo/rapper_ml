[Intro/Verse]
Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfuckin' big screen
Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD
Knock knock, bitch, I'm kickin' in the front door
Live forever, get them motherfuckin' blunts rolled
Now I pull up and I get it how I want, ho
Now I pull up, not on purpose, and I stunt, ho
I got problems with your motherfuckin' god
I been workin' like I never had a job
Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfuckin' big screen
Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD

[Chorus]
Knock knock, bitch, I'm kickin' in the front door
Live forever, get them motherfuckin' blunts rolled
Now I pull up and I get it how I want, hoe
Now I pull up, not on purpose, and I stunt, ho
I got problems with your motherfuckin' god
I been workin' like I never had a job
Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfuckin' big screen
Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD
Knock knock, bitch, I'm kickin' in the front door
Live forever, get them motherfuckin' blunts rolled
Now I pull up and I get it how I want, ho
Now I pull up, not on purpose, and I stunt, ho
I got problems with your motherfuckin' god
I been workin' like I never had a job
Everytime I hit the dope I have a new dream
Havin' visions of everybody who knew me
See my face on the motherfuckin' big screen
Live forever, bitch, I'm smokin' on that HD
