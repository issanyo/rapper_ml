[Intro: Lil Peep]
Welcome to my world, cocaina pearls
And my diamonds jumping, I was fucking on yo girl
Now you wanna jump me, I be all over the world
I be busy, come and find me with them cocaina pearls

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Welcome to my world, cocaina pearls
And my diamonds jumping, I was fucking on yo girl
Now you wanna jump me, I be all over the world
I be busy, come and find me with them cocaina pearls
Bitches all around me with them cocaina pearls
Busy, come and find me with them cocaina pearls
Cocaina girls, cocaina pearls
Bitches all around me with them cocaina pearls
Cocaina

[Verse: KirbLaGoop]
Who need white? Who need brown?
We pour up to the death
Fuck yo block
Like you tell, lil whoadie got that dope for cheap
All that ether, that shit for free
Lil mama pay the 2's and 50's
I'm trapping off until they kill me
If I get caught, I take no pleading
Watch me move all day, can you boom and bunk?
Cracking 2's all day, I serve out the front
Let it swim, watch me drop a deuce to the ground
I got the recipe, 1 double-O to the end
Hoes here, hoes there, oh you wanna come, punch in
I got 'em lined up to the front, breaking bitches my purpose
For my service I got wet wet to cocaina
Keep it pimping on the set, [?] Sabrina

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Welcome to my world, cocaina pearls
And my diamonds jumping, I was fucking on yo girl
Now you wanna jump me, I be all over the world
I be busy, come and find mewith them cocaina pearls
Bitches all around me with them cocaina pearls
Busy, come and find me with them cocaina pearls
Cocaina girls, cocaina pearls
Bitches all around me with them cocaina pearls
Cocaina
