[Hook: Lil PEEP]
I don´t give a fuck how you feeling about me
Back of the club, bad bitches around me
Back in the day why everyone doubt me
Look at my outfit, somebody count me
Choke on my dick if you're trying to shade me
I don´t give a fuck if you're trying to play me
I don´t give a fuck if you're trying to save me
Yeah I got bitches not one of them date me

[Verse: Eddy Baker]
Know I pulled up with a box of blunts
Range Rover filled with sluts
Shoe box filled with blunts
Rolling up that stinky skunk
Light it up, they know what´s up
Getting money with my bros
Bad bitches they show us love
Hit the crib and let us fuck
Came in sober leaving  drunk
Young nigga, I'm having fun
Lean in my Hawaiian punch
Drank too much I'm throwing up
All my shows be going up
That´s why your girl be choosing us
[?]
My life like Ferris Bueller was
Posted in the breakfast club
Just like [?] smoking drugs
Where's my molly we´re gon try and see if she fuck with a thug
Healthyboyz cartel
Got narcotics if you need a buzz
Blowing all my money on designer cuz I'm young and dumb
