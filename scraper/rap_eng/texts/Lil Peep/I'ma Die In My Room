If I had one night, I would spend it with you
I need help real soon, I'ma die in my room
You wanna come fly, too, gettin' high as the moon
I might spread my wings tonight
Iâ€™m gon' pack my things tonight
Phone's gon' ring tonight
Hear the angels sing tonight (hear the angels sing tonight)
No matter what you bring tonight
I'm gon' win the fight
Peep gon' make it right
(Peep gon' make it right)
Passing time, gettin' high in the candle light
Gettin' mine, I be flying, you can stand aside
But a heart wanna die, I never live my life
You can see it in my eyes, that I can't decide
I'm fucked up but my heart still beats for you
Broken heart, can't breathe in the waitin' room
Now I'm faced with the test of forgettin' you
Got the whole club packed, try gettin' through
