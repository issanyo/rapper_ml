[Verse]
Big things comin', Schema Boys thuggin'
It's the posse, bitch, we runnin' shit and no, it ain't nothin'
Maxed out, shawty, now my battery full
I got plenty more to go, find me back at the show
I got plenty more to roll, I ain't done with you, ho
I'ma slit your fuckin' throat, I ain't done with you, bro
Now I'm in my fuckin' mode, bitch, leave me alone
Bet the boys got my back, I ain't schemin' alone

[Hook]
I can't feel my own fuckin' face, help
I can't feel my own fuckin' face
I can't feel my own fuckin' face, help
I can't feel my own fuckin' face
I can't feel my own fuckin' face, help
I can't feel my own fuckin' face
I can't feel my own fuckin' face, help
I can't feel my own fuckin'.... face
