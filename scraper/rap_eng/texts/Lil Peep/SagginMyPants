[Verse 1] Death+

Spirits comin after me
I'm bout to start a tragedy
A murderous inferno
Strike the matches and I grab the keys
I head up to the palace
Cop a backwoods -------
But everybody knows that I'm a fucking abnormality

[Verse 2] Lil Peep

I've been letting my hair grow, your parents know
I'm the bad boy, I'm a scarecrow
I'm sagging my pants, let the brand show
These damn hose schemin'
Got the brand on my hand hoe
I come from the land where the xans go
Quicker than the coke raise your hands if you can't cope
With the damn cold, seven feet of snow
Whatchu need we got it, bleeding for deposits
Just bag it up and then you flip it for a sizable profit
The cops is on my dick I'm bout to get this shit poppin
I'm dropping out this bitch and making money off of my music
Now it's one year later still broke still stupid
Still smoke my tooka, rest in peace Martin Luther
But Freddy Kruger all I'm dreaming bout
I can't see my future
I can't see my feet, this shit gets darker when it's deeper
I can breathe underwater ask your daughter
I'm a freak, Peep
