[Intro: Lil Peep]
Cocaine shawty, lookin' at me naughty
Met her at the party, now she all up on me
If you lookin' for me, posted with my .40
Cocaine shawty, touchin' on your body

(I'll do anything for some blow right now)

[Chorus: Yunggoth]
Bentley dranks, a quarter pound, I need it for the weekend
Live my life alone, that's why I only pull one-seated
Aye, try to make me settle, boy, I call her on the weekend
Danger when I want to, boy, you know it's Puerto Rican
Aye, rifle on my Louie Vuittons, what she call my shooter song
Xannie, ain't no foolin', boy, damn foreign shootin' star
Live and love, I die alone, pretty bitches in my phone
Skinny bitches in my home, cocaine shawty, give me dome
Cocaine shorty, wipe your nose, cocaine shawty, die alone
Cocaine shawty, cry alone, cocaine shawty, cry alone
Cocaine shawty, wipe your nose, cocaine shawty, die alone
Cocaine shawty, cry alone, cocaine shawty, yeah, yeah

[Verse: Lil Peep]
Cocaine shawty, lookin' at me naughty (yeah)
Met her at the party (yeah), now she all up on me (damn)
If you lookin' for me (yeah), posted with my .40 (40)
Cocaine shawty (yeah), touchin' on your body
Pull up in a 'Rari (skrt), tell my ex, "I'm sorry" (sorry)
She cannot afford me (nah), shoutout to my mommy (mom)
Pull up with the Tommy (tom'), my bitch in Abercrombie ('cromb)
Leanin' out the bottle (lean), I feel like a zombie (damn)
Cocaine shawty, lookin' at me naughty
Met her at the party, now she all up on me (yeah)
If you lookin' for me, posted with my .40 (40)
Cocaine shawty (shawty), touchin' on your body
Pull up in a 'Rari (yeah), tell my ex, "I'm sorry" (yeah)
She cannot afford me (nah), shoutout to my mommy (mom)
Pull up with the Tommy (tom'), my bitch in Abercrombie ('cromb)
Leanin' out the bottle (damn), I feel like a zombie
