Part One

[Hook: LiL PEEP & Killstation]
One more night alone (one more night alone)
Heaven, I'm coming home (Heaven, I'm coming home)
One more night on the road (one more night on the road)
But I'll be gone before I get back home (I'll be gone before I get back home)
One more night alone (one more night alone)
Heaven, I'm coming home (Heaven, I'm coming home)
One more night on the road (One more night on the road)
Know she love it when I come back home (when I come back home)
One more night alone (one more night alone)
Heaven, I'm coming home (Heaven, I'm coming home)
One more night on the road (one more night on the road)
But I'll be gone before I get back home (I'll be gone before I get back home)
One more night alone (one more night alone)
Heaven, I'm coming home (Heaven, I'm coming home)
One more night on the road (one more night on the road)
Know she love it when I come back home (she love it when I come back home)
She love it when I come back home

Part Two

[Verse 1: JGRXXN]
Five to your motherfucking face
JGRXXN don't give a damn
Who got niggas on the way
Bring the mask out
For the cash out mane
You know I'm on the scene
Wit the wit the Ghostemane

[Verse 2: Ghostemane]
I am so sick of talking, I'd rather be showin ya
To the bottom of the ocean and tie you up in a sunken boat
And now I am a schema, I scheme with Peep in the Beamer
Then crash it into a tree with you in the trunk then I flee the scene

[Verse 3: Kold-Blooded]
So watch da Hidden Characters
Tearing through any barrier
You can feel the aura
Engulfing your whole exterior
Inferior, period
Tell me, Why you so serious?
When Kold Akuma unleashes
Clear out the whole damn area
Once the Posse strikes fear in ya
Never will you hear from them
Try and deny it
Defiance
Only option reasonable
Leavin' em all bleeding
All season
Deed is always feasible
Contagious diseases
You been infected by da SchemaBoys

Part Three

[Verse 1: OmenXIII]
You a fuck boy swerve, bitch I'm finna murder
Leave your name in the dirt and your ashes in the urn
OmenXIII leave you hurt, Black painted nails, with a all black shirt
You think you up next, I don't rest, I'm the best, no contest Bitch better wait your turn

[Verse 2: Brennan Savage]
Pull up with my brothers you know that's a fact
Man we don't know how to act
All in this bitch and we making a pact
Eliminate anyone else walking up in our path
Talking that shit behind all of our backs
Sipping 'tusson and calling it act
I'm the man in the mirror looking back
Wasn't no one now I'm on the track

[Hook: Ghostemane]
I don't wanna count sheep no more
I don't wanna lose sleep no more
Only thing that I need is a little bit of cognac
I don't wanna hate no more
I don't wanna count sheep no more
I don't wanna lose sleep no more
Only thing that I need is a little bit of cognac
I don't wanna hate no more

[Outro: Killstation]
One more night alone (one more night alone)
Heaven, I'm coming home (Heaven, I'm coming home)
One more night alone (one more night alone)
Heaven, I'm coming home (Heaven, I'm coming home)
