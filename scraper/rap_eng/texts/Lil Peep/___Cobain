[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I just fell in love with a bad bitch
Told me that she love me too, baby, I'm not havin' it
Sniffin' cocaine, 'cause I didn't have no Actavis
Smokin' propane, with my clique and the bad
Bitches call me Cobain
She can see the pain
Look me in the eyes, girl, we are not the same
Bitch, I'll make it rain on my side bitch, shout out to my main
Fell in love once, and I never been the same

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
Lil Tracy, I used to rob, but I shop now
Comin' up, I might get recognized when I walk around
Coolin' with Lil Peep, let's hit the mall tomorrow
I'ma mix American Eagle with some Ralph Lauren
I got a bad bitch who is good to me
Baby, I see passion in your eyes, when you look at me
I'ma show you off, like some Louis V
Coke lines on the mirror, snort that line for me

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I just fell in love with a bad bitch
Told me that she love me too, baby, I'm not havin' it
Sniffin' cocaine, 'cause I didn't have no Actavis
Smokin' propane, with my clique and the bad
Bitches call me Cobain
She can see the pain
Look me in the eyes, girl, we are not the same
Bitch, I'll make it rain on my side bitch, shout out to my main
Fell in love once, and I never been the same
