[Hook: Lil Peep]
I'm a rockstar
I'm a rockstar
Shoot myself in the face, I'm a rockstar
I got pulled over, I'm in a cop car
They want my full name, I told 'em rockstar

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
She think I am a rockstar, 'cause I am
She think I am a rockstar, so she fuck my friends
Baby, I'm a rockstar, 'till the end
Baby, I'm a beamer boy, motherfuck your Benz
She think I'm a rockstar, 'cause I am

[Verse 2: ITSOKTOCRY]
I'm a rockstar
Avril Lavigne - pop star
Oh my god, my cock hard
For Blue Benz and a drop top
GG Allin -  rockstar
OD on that hard rock
That don't mean the block hot
Stop talkin' you a opp

[Bridge: ITSOKTOCRY]
I'm a rockstar
I'm a rockstar

[Verse 3: Jimmy V]
I'm a rockstar
Finna pop some rocks
Blue Benz and blue oxys
She said, "Okay, I'm sorry"
Off the molly, I pop her like a ollie
Say she want that green
She bite the xanny off like Ozzy

[Hook: Lil Peep]
I'm a rockstar
I'm a rockstar
Shoot myself in the face, I'm a rockstar
I got pulled over, I'm in a cop car
They want my full name, I told 'em rockstar
