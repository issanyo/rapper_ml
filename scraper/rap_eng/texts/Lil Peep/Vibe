[Verse]
I been spendin' time
Time after time
Tryna get my mind right
But, I just find I been lyin'
Lyin' to myself
I don't need your help
I been just fine on my own
Baby, I could handle mine
I could multiply
I could satisfy
Anybody tryn' see me shine
Man, that's just the way I grind
I been on my grind
You been on my line
Thats the reason why
I been workin' hard
You could stand aside
I could never die
I got too much pride
That's why she always cryin' tell me
I'll live forever thru my vibe
I can never die
I got too much pride
Thats why she always cryin' tell me
I'll live forever thru my vibe

[Outro]
That's why she always cryin' tell me
I'll live forever thru my vibe
That's why she always cryin' tell me
I'll live forever thru my vibe
