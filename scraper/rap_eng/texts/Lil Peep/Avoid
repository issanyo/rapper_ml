[Verse 1: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL & DØVES]
You'll only see us in the back
GothBoiClique, all black
I knew love once, it's hard to forget
I thought of you and nights spent
When I'm backed against the wall
I thought of her and highly
'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me
And I miss 2013 love songs
And I'm so lost, under club lights
In the all black, GothBoiClique

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs

[Verse 2: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL & DØVES]
Fucked up in the back of the club
Cast a sigil in the back of the club
I got scars on me, no love
Light a candle and I pray for Døves
And you're fadin' away, like the pill under my tongue
We seriously never even touched, it sucks
I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood
It's so fucked
So tell me what is love
If I ever had it, if I ever had it
Did I really want it?
And why can't I remember?
I cannot remember
I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away
Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If there's passion there, then show me
Fast, hard
It's a slow drug
And I swear that
But it's true love
These are true lines

[Verse 3: DØVES]
Saw you in the back of the club again
And we just started textin' again
And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist
I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed (tryin' so hard)
And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM
And now we took a bottle to your bed
Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red
And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck
And you think you can make me love again
I swear that I will never feel a thing
Hollow shell, quiet hell, but you're so into me
Screamin', "Why don't you love me back?!"
'Cause it's GothBoiClique, 'til my lungs collapse

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
