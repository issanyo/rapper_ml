[Chorus: Bexey]
I-I-I
Yeah you just keep slaying through the
Ni-i-ight
No try not to worry that you're
Mi-i-ine
Oh baby, baby
You're my type
Exactly what I like

[Verse 1: Bexey]
Mm, She a night-slayer
Razor all up in the Gucci Blazer
She got Co-Caine up on her septum ring
It don't phase her
She a heart-breaker
Got blood along, but if I can make her
But lover mine, baby let me come insi-i-ide
She don't text back to nobody
She don't let hands in the bunny hole
Unless it's bexey
Or one of them boys in GBC

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Touch down
New faces
Overseas I brought blue faces
Shoe cases, Shoe pace
My gold grills got her mind racin'
Pop pills in that Free Mason
Margiela? I'm drag racin'
Don't come if you ain't fuckin'
I'm on drugs when I'm London
In public
On drugs and I'm in public

[Chorus: Bexey]
I-I-I
Yeah you just keep slaying through the
Ni-i-ight
No try not to worry that you're
Mi-i-ine
Oh baby, baby
You're my type
Exactly what I like
