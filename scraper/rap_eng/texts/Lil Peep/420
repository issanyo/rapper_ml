[Intro]
Yeah, right there

[Verse 1: Death+]
Smoke all the Sweets 'til I can't even breathe
Smoke up in my room, I can barely even see (goddamn)
TH, PS3, skate in the street, smokin' my blunt in the trees
My thoughts are covered in leaves, they're never pleased
No success, no release
Do what the fuck I want
Take my time, take my grind
Pack this shit up in my blunt
I don't need to fuckin' rap, man
I just need my fuckin' blunt
Fuck this shit, I rap, man
I just need a mothafuckin' blunt
'Cause all I do is smoke, all I do is roll
All I do is choke on that [?] red smoke
'Cause all I do is smoke, all I do is roll
All I do is choke on that [?] red smoke
Goddamn, purp
Dopeman blunt
In my mothafuckin' blunts
Take this shit to my lungs
I be smokin' Sour D every day of the month, bitch


[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Breathe, stretch
Deep breath
Life, death
Smokin' these blunts to my neck 'til I go
Hold in my lungs and I resin my throat
Choke from the blunt while I flex on your ho
Smoke, smoke
Pass the gas and the light
Smack on that ass and I bite her
I'll make that pussy feel tighter
Blowin' my smoke at a spider
I'm gettin' bugs high
Bitch, I'm a swamp guy
I'll give you one shot
Bitch, take your best shot
I could really give a fuck about you people
Smokin' reefer like this shit don't make me evil
Meet the reaper while I'm burnin' down the steeple
Keep the beeper by the heater, that's illegal
Fuck what you thought
Fuck what you bought
Fuck what you drive
I'm fuckin' your mind
Scuffin' my kicks
I play for the Knicks
Cuts in my wrist
'Cause I know that nobody can fuck with this shit
I feel so alone, look at the clones
If your body dope but  your mind in the gutter then don't call my phone
I'm good on my own
Blowin this dope out my throat what cho bitch won't stop watchin me fo?
Got your bitch moppin' the flow
I'm gettin' cancer, I'm gettin' cancer, I'm gettin' cancer, ho
I heard you be dancin', ho, don't make me wait, I won't answer, ho
Don't got the answers, don't got the answers, don't got the answers, ho
I am not fancy, I am not wealthy, bitch you can't talk 'bout my clothes

[Outro: Lil Peep]
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
Put your middle finger to the sky
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
Put your middle finger to the sky
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
'Cause we really wanna get high
Everybody wanna get high
Put your middle finger to the sky, don't ask why
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
Put your middle finger to the sky
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
Put your middle finger to the sky
Middle fingers up in the sky, don't ask why
'Cause we really wanna get high
Everybody wanna get high
Put your middle finger to the sky, don't ask why
