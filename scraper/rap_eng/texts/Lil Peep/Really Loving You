Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
I hope it's true, ’cause, I'm really loving you
I can't believe, that, you’re really loving me
I hope it's true, 'cause, I'm really loving you
I can't believe, that, you're really loving me

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Yeah
I hope you know the truth, my homies got the blues (Oh)
And I be in the news (Oh yeah)
And I don't wanna lose you (Nah, nah)
Praying that I choose (Yeah)
What you wanna do?
Baby we can get some food (Yup), if you in the mood (Woah)
And I got swag (Yeah), pills in the bag (Yeah)
I used to make her mad (Wooh), I used to make her sad
And I'm in the Jag (Skrr), I don’t mean to brag
But I got swag now, pills in the bag now (Yeah)

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
I hope it’s true, 'cause, I’m really loving you
I can't believe, that, you're really loving me
I hope it's true, ’cause, I'm really loving you
I can't believe, that, you're really loving me

[Verse 2: iLoveMakonnen]
You know it's true, babe
You can tell it when I talk all night
You can tell it when we're walking by
You can tell it ain't no other guy
You're on my mind, yeah, and I wish that I could call you, boy
I wish that you would hit my text
I'm never tryna be your ex

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen and Lil Peep]
I hope it's true, 'cause, I'm really loving you (I'm really loving you)
I can't believe (I can't believe that), that, you're really loving me (You're really loving me, yeah)
I hope it's true (I hope it's true), 'cause, I'm really loving you (Yeah, I'm really loving you, yeah)
I can't believe (I can't believe that), that, you're really loving me (You're really loving me)

[Outro: iLoveMakonnen, Lil Peep and Both]
I hope it's true (I hope it's true)
I hope it's true (I hope it's true), 'cause I can't believe (I can't believe that), that (Yeah), you're really loving me (Yeah)
I can't believe, that you're really loving me, you're really loving me, yeah
