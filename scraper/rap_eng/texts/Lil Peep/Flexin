[Hook]
I'm still flexin
Shout out to Texas
Shout out to Brooklyn
Shout out to my ex bitch
I'm still geekin
I'm still tweaking
Every fucking weekend
I be in the deep end
I cannot function, still in the function
I'm still stuntin'
I just want the hundreds
Goddamn youngin'
I been gettin money
I ain't with the bullshit
Try and take it from me
