[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
It's the king of the swamp
Come out the mud with the bugs on my face
And the muck in my lungs
Tucking my gun
Keep it under my tongue
When I open my mouth
Get to ducking and run
Sucking me up bitches stuck on my nuts
Cause I fuck ‘em and bust on they face when I'm done
Lucky for us, she gon’ act like it's done
I be making them sweat like they under the sun
I keep a felony on me wherever I go
When I don't got no strap
I keep my enemies close to me
They not my homies, I know for a fact
I keep my Hennessy open
I keep my bitch twerkin' like she in a bath
I keep the medicine rollin
Like fuck where you going
I'm smoking a sack
Looking like a flight risk
Blood on the light switch
Don't get too close or you might get
Sliced with the knife I grip in my right fist
Catch me throwin’ dick at a white bitch
Catch me gettin lit like a light which
Make slits in my wrist, fuck life
This don't mean shit to none of y'all listening
Sip blood from a goat at my christening
Ice flood like a bolt sea glistening
On my wrist why am I
Talking bout my wrist again
Lil Peep write songs for the middleman
Get back to the seminar never known
In my head hear gunshots letting off
Stone cold in the moss from the swamp
When the sun go down don't get lost

[Verse 2: Atoms]
When you see me with the mask
Don’t I look so good like that?
I’m drinking my flask and getting some ass
I roll into the scene and I slit my wrist
I’m feeling like [???]
[???]
I’m making these changes, [???]
[???], but bitch I’m still dangerous
With my mask off feelin’ like [???], no shame
And do y’all motherfuckers like me
Don’t give a fuck about you, get the fuck from my sight
[???]
I’m closing my eyes, [???]
The morning comes and I [???]
‘Cause I [???], the blade on my hip
I finish a blunt then I [????]
[???]
I’m making these bitches no longer exist

[Hook: Atoms]
We the fuckin’ killers from the garden
Lost in the fall with a party singin’ songs like [???]
Feelin’ like a motherfuckin’ god
I’m running through my hood, still screaming “fuck god” like [???]
We the fuckin’ killers from the garden
Lost in the fall with a party singin’ songs like [???]
Feelin’ like a motherfuckin’ god
I’m running through my hood, still screaming “fuck god” like [???]
