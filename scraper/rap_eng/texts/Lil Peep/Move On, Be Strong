[Hook]
Move on, I'm gone, baby, I'm not comin' back, nah
Be strong, you're wrong, girl, I'm not comin' back
I'd kill for you, I'd die for you, but I'm not coming back
Blood spilled for you, I get high for you, and your new man's fuckin' wack (I'm not comin' back)

[Bridge]
I'm not comin' back
Move on
Be strong
Be strong
I'm not comin' back

[Interlude]
(I... I...I love you)
