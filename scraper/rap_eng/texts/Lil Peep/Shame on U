[Intro]
Hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life comes after death
Grab my knife (my)
Haardtek

[Verse]
Cut my ties and hold my breath (Breath)
Let the tie do all the rest (Rest)
What if life comes after death (What)
Grab my knife, find out myself (-Self)
All the nights I spent on you (On you)
All the lights inside my room (My room)
Saw the fights that we sought through (Sought through)
Fool me twice, put the blame on you, yeah

[Chorus]
(Cut my ties and hold my breath
Let the tie do all the rest
What if life come after death)
Grab my knife, find out myself
All the nights I spent on you
All the lights inside my room
Saw the fights that we sought through
Fool me twice, then it's shame on u

[Outro]
Where did you go this time?
What if I lose my mind?
What if I make you cry?
What if I die?
What if I end my fuckin' life?
