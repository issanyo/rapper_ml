[Verse 1: OmenXIII]
You say that you're depressed, I don't know who you're fooling
I can see right through you
And I see you've never been through it
And you said you've slit your wrists so whats the hold up, get to it
I can't stand a bitch like you who thinks it's cool to pollute it
I don't understand why you would ever say that shit jokingly
Looking for some edgy punchlines just end up looking clueless
You're a Pussy wannabe using my pain as some imagery
I've gotten tallies down my forearm if you want me to prove it

[Chorus]
I'm getting so restless
All of the sudden I'm getting so restless
Where is the checklist?
Have I done all that I needed to do
Before I go and follow my deathwish, helpless
All of the time, even if I had all of the time
Even if I had all the time
Would I ever have enough to bring some meaning to my simple life?

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Bitch wait lemme get this straight
Bitch may talkin' bout self-hate
Don't lie know your life just great
Quit makin' mixtapes
Sit down needa stay
You fake every word you say
Every word you say so fake
It make me shake
It make quake
I wanna hit you in your...
Who we?
Who we?
Not thirteen
Not Lil P
We keep that blade in these
Back pocket of our jeans
There's something haunting me
It wants to watch me bleed
It wants my body rotting slowly in a hollow tree
Follow me
Take you to the place that you don't wanna be
You talk about it all the time
I'm living in it constantly
There is no escape
This is way more than a fucking scene
What the fuck's a scene
You're just a bunch of actors playing me

[Verse 3: OmenXIII]
I'm looking in my mind
Not so sure what I see
Floating through a tunnel
taking me from life to a dream
What's the difference
What's the difference
What the fuck does it mean?
I cant close my eyes
And I keep hearing things in my sleep
Am I even sleeping?
Seeping through the cracks in between
Now I'm talkin' to myself
And myself's talking back to me
You can never be alone
And that's the scariest thing
Me and me getting to know each other's
such a relief

[Chorus]
I'm getting so restless
All of the sudden I'm getting so restless
Where is the checklist?
Have I done all that I needed to do
Before I go and follow my deathwish, helpless
All of the time, even if I had all of the time
Even if I had all the time
Would I ever have enough to bring some meaning to my simple life?
