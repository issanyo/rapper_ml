[Verse 1]
Doing drugs on a highway
Feeling like it's friday
I think it's a sunday
She hit me up on MySpace
Shawty drive a Hyundai
I pull up in an i8
Now she wanna fuck, wait
What the fuck did I say
Bitch I'm coming up, stand back, don't communicate
I don't need your hoes or your flows you could duplicate
Pussy I'ma lubricate
I'ma eat your pussy bitch
When I'm ridin' through your state
Everybody look at this

[Chorus]
I could make a movie, ay
I could make a movie bitch
She say she a groupie, ay
She say she a groupie bitch
She think that I'm stupid, ay
'Cause I'm going stupid bitch
It's mud on my gucci
I got mud on my gucci kicks

[Chorus]
I could make a movie, ay
I could make a movie bitch
She say she a groupie, ay
She say she a groupie bitch
She think that I'm stupid, ay
'Cause I'm going stupid bitch
It's mud on my gucci
I got mud on my gucci kicks
