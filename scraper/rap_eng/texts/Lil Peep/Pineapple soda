[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Bitch I been the man since the age of five
If I stop my glow then I might just die
When I'm on my own I just smoke and cry
I turn off my phone I can't hear your lies
I been smoking dope you can see in my eyes
Goth girl come over and I'm squeezing her thighs
Tell me that she love me but I know that's a lie
I know that you're playing him but I'm not that guy

[Verse 2: Foreign Forest]
Eyes black, we bloom when I'm all alone I just think 'bout you
Back to the shit that we get into
Now you're with him and he's like me too
With a dude full of rues smoking dope on the road
With a box full of matches brew in the coat holder
You're cute I just wish you were older
And sometimes I just wish my life was over
Watching MTV up inside my rover
Feeling lucky like a four leaf clover
Dropping pills in my pineapple soda
Thinking 'bout shit that I can't when I'm sober
Been running since 21 too
Getting high in my ride when I think 'bout you
Got shit that you say you gotta do
I just hope on my life to see you come through

[Verse 3: Dank $inatra]
Lying.. why are you lying
I know you feel like you the only one trying
You dying to find you
Girl I been trying so hard just to tell you the truth
I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the shit on your boots and you know its true
I'm on the phone and I can't tell you looks cause I'm thinking 'bout you but it's all about...
On another, with a goddamn complex thinking 'bout you was last months truth
Swear to god gotta goddamn complex all because I'm with gotta look like you
Lying.. why are you lying
I know you feel like you the only one trying
But come check my vitals
I'm already dying
