Blueberry Lemonade
Honeyberry gymshorts
Posted with your bitch, she count my money burning Newport's Blueberry Lemonade
BlackBerry cellphone
Black bandana round my toes, I don't bang though
Blueberry candy paint
Screw back in that tape deck
Take your bitch, I scrape her neck then skate off with that paycheck
Blueberry Lemonade, you can keep your Hennessy
Xen gone keep it pimpin', bitch quit attempting to end me
Blueberry Lemonade

Young Ned came through with a bad bitch on my hip, ayy
Young Ned came through and swallow all of my dick, ayy

[Verse 3: Lil Peep]
Blueberry, Lemonade, hoes mad, let 'em hate

I feel like Dwayne Carter, all the freaks love me
Kick the bitch out, if she don't suck me
Pull my dick out, let yo hoe suck me
Bitch I'm so ugly, but she still fuck me
Bitch I'm backstage, trap-phone making plays
Bitch I'm that dope, pull up looking like coke
I'm an asshole, drugs make my night slow (make my night slow)
And I love snow, make yo bitch sniff coke (sniff coke)
On my dick though (yah)
I got 6 hoes (yah)
