[Chorus]
And I'll be with you 'till the end, girl
No matter what we're goin' through
You know you my best friend, girl
I don't wanna lose you
But, I gotta go now
And I'll be with you in the Benz, girl
Like I was with you in the coupe
You know you my best friend, girl
I don't wanna lose you
But, I gotta go now

[Verse]
Bust it, bust it
So I just popped another Xan now (xan now)
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
I don't know what the fuck to do (what to do)
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
I can't believe I'm not your man now (not your man now)
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
I just wanna hold you, but I can't find you (can't find you)
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
And I been lookin' for a while now (for a while now)
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
I think I might be lookin' through (lookin' through)
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
A telescope into the sky, how haven't I found anyone
Who love me like you do
