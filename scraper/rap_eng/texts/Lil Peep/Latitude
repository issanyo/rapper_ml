[Intro: Andy Kaufman - Kick In The Pants]
I think you straighten up a little bit
I think you should, i think you know
You should, you should look at yourself in the mirror sometimes
And say: "Look, what am i doing? Why, why am i this way?"

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Ain't going nowhere, with that attitude
I can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude
Ain't going nowhere, with that attitude
I can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude
Going nowhere; when I'm mad at you
I can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude
Going nowhere; when I'm mad at you
I can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
Talk to me this time, she said
Just talk to me this time
Fuck me [?] baby, fuck me
Hold me this time, she said
Just talk to me this time
Fuck me [?] baby, fuck me

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Ain't going nowhere, with that attitude
I can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude
Ain't going nowhere, with that attitude
I can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude
Going nowhere; with that attitude
I can't find anyone that's like me at this latitude

[Outro: Lil Peep]
Talk to me this time, she said
Just talk to me this time
