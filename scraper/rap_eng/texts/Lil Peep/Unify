[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Unify
Bring your people together and watch it multiply
They in control of the weather
Suicide
That's my only escape
This game is do or die
But Agoff with me keepin' me safe
In your mind, like your goddamn brain
You feel it in your spine, you feel my goddamn pain
I put it in my rhymes, now I'm livin' forever
I can never die, somethin' 'bout me oh so special

[Verse: AGoff]
Ayy, bringin' my niggas together
All of my niggas, we livin' forever
Bitch, I be rockin' Margielas
And I got Gucci all over my sweater, bitch, I do it better
Bitch I'm so clever, you know my level (what?)
All of my niggas get money together (damn)
Move as a unit, niggas so stupid
Run up on me and get hit with the Uzi
Commas and sushi, takin' your freak
Me and Lil Peep might pull up in the Jeep
Niggas forgot it's all 'bout unity
Fuck with Lil Peep then you fuckin' with me
Niggas is sweet, niggas is weak (what?)
I'ma come clean I got racks in my jeans
Got a little bitch and she look like Shakira
Niggas be talkin' but I cannot listen
Put the gun down, take a look in the mirror
My niggas is drippin', your niggas is [?]
How this shit livin', it's just how I'm livin'
I gotta go get it, I'm chasin' these millions
Got a few shooters, keep that on the low
You know it's all about unity though
Run up on Lil Peep and I'm lettin' it go
He prolly just mad 'cause I'm fuckin' his ho

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Unify
Bring your people together and watch it multiply
They in control of the weather
Suicide
That's my only escape
This game is do or die
But Agoff with me keepin' me safe
In your mind, like your goddamn brain
You feel it in your spine, you feel my goddamn pain
I put it in my rhymes, now I'm livin' forever
I can never die, somethin' 'bout me oh so special
