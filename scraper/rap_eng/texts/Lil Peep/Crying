[Hook: YungGoth]
Gave her one call, now this bitch start cryin'
GothBoiClique
Shawty wanna die, but I know that bitch is lyin'
Flexed up dyin', with my clique, I'm cryin'
I wasn't lyin', I was lyin'
I just wanna flex on my wrist, start a riot
Lies on the ring, baby, yeah
I just wanna ride 'til my car's on fire
Really sorry, I think you should retire

[Verse: LiL PEEP]
Lie me down in bed, got my side bitch cryin'
Facetime Horse Head, tell him that I'm dyin'
Even though I'm lyin', I might not be lyin'
Drugs that I'm mixin', you don't wanna try it
Lie me down in bed, got my side bitch cryin'
Lie me down in bed, got my side bitch cryin'
Main bitch wildin', pussy in my diet
Lie me down in bed, got my side bitch cryin', tryin'
I don't even think about her anymore
I guess I got what I wanted, yeah
I don't even dream about her every night
Can't you tell that I'm lyin'?
I was in the background every time
Now, I'm in the middle of the spotlight
Everything you said to me was at the perfect time
Baby girl, you know it's not right, not right, it's not right
