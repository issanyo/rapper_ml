[Verse 1: OmenXIII]
Sittin' on the docks, boba on the rocks
People hit my line but I don't wanna talk
I'm tryin' to be calm, I don't wanna see the clock
Don't wanna see my moms, don't wanna see my pops
Just wanna see you, but you don't wanna see me
I think i'm seeing things that the people won't believe
Just wanna see some change that I'm never gonna see
So I keep my eyes closed while i try to find my peace
Don't even wanna eat, only eat once a day
Sippin' boba on the rocks with that [?] everyday
I can't even smoke weed, for me that was just a phase
But you know I still supply, if you need to cop today
Hit my line, scoop you up, Mango juice with the stuff
Grind it up, bust some blunts, got some liquor, that's a plus
You can smoke, I'll get drunk, and we'll bob to this jawn
Better see you walking up, if you think that I'm a punk
'Cause I ain't a fuckin' fool, and I just ain't you
And I gotta stack my money to do what I gotta do
See I know it's just some paper, please tell me what else is new
But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food, yup
(But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food, yup)
(But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food, yup)

[Verse 2: LiL PEEP]
Back to the head, bitch I smoke it like I had to
Cracks in my head, like a motherfuckin' statue
Back to back with the lead, spittin' out the fuckin' barrel
Young white pharaoh in the back of the Camaro (skrr)
Dopamine release, copin' with the freezer
With the coats made of geese, can you feel my energy
It's floatin' in the breeze, growin' with the trees
Wake up in the morning by the ocean on the beach, Peep
Take away my pain, feel my body up with love
See you landed in my bed, but you've fallen from above
Every time you give me head, got my body goin' numb
See you probably in your bed while I'm probably goin' dumb
On these beats, swervin' thru the streets (damn)
Flip a couple packs and keep applying with the heat
Pressure cooker Peep, steppin' on your feet
Tell em rest in peace, cut your body to a piece, you deceased
Yellin' bitch I ain't a fool, and I just ain't you
You the type to take the red and I'm the type to take the blue
See I know it's just some paper, tryna get up out my room
But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food, yuh
(But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food, yuh)
But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food
Sippin' boba on the rocks got the Right strain too
In the East, in the West, what you need, we comin' through, bitch
