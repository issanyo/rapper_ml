[Intro: Lil Tracy & Lil Peep]
Yeah
GothBoiClique
BeatFeed
Yeah, I'm sipping wine
Hey, pass me the wine bruh
GBC
GothBoiClique
Stop, you're blowing kisses in the wind, you feel me? (Fu, fu, fu)

[Chorus: LiL PEEP]
Blowing kisses in the wind, I'mma show her how I swim
When the lights get dim and the time right
We just met on meeting ends, I could fuck my bitch's friends
I'mma fuck that bitch to death, yeah, her pussy tight
Blowing kisses in the wind, I'mma show her how I swim
When the lights get dim and the time right
We just met on meeting ends, I could fuck my bitch's friends
I'mma fuck that bitch to death, yeah, her pussy tight

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
I can't see the future, I see paparazzi
Bad bitch riding on me, rolling off the molly
That's your girl? Wait, hold up, she ain't let me know it
Instagram, she posting photos just hoping I notice
Step in the club, they tryna get cameras in focus
I'm a vampire, I do not like the light on me
Fuck a friend, fuck a homie, I'm all by my lonely
Kush smoking, wine pouring at four in the morning
Peep and Tracy, two Mercedes, we race to the castle
No new friends, I feel like Drake, baby, I'm such a asshole
Break the cocaine off the brick and put it in her asshole
Vampire in the moonlight, counting up the pesos

[Chorus: LiL PEEP]
Blowing kisses in the wind, I'mma show her how I swim
When the lights get dim and the time right
We just met on meeting ends, I could fuck my bitch's friends
I'mma fuck that bitch to death, yeah, her pussy tight
Blowing kisses in the wind, I'mma show her how I swim
When the lights get dim and the time right
We just met on meeting ends, I could fuck my bitch's friends
I'mma fuck that bitch to death, yeah, her pussy tight
