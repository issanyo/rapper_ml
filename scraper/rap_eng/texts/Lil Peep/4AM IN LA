[Intro: CHXPO]
Goth boys, goth boys
Lil' Peep, CHXPO, CHXPO, CHXPO
Lil' Peep and CHXPO, CHXPO, CHXPO

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Fell in love with the wrong one
I got pills on me, CHXPO keep a long gun
We ain't even trying to start nothing
Please don't do something, I might have to prove something
I'ma die with my pride on my back, that's a fact
I got cold blood, I got cold act
I'ma ride, I'ma die, if I lack get my ass whacked
Pray I don't go out like that

[Verse 1: CHXPO]
Cold blooded, heartless
Can you feel my darkness
Juggin in apartments
I was so regardless
Balenciaga carpets
In my tool house
I got it off the boat
I don't take no handouts
Niggas wanna see me fall
Some niggas wanna see me ball
You don't wanna stand tall
I really do this shit for y'all
Cuz we can't swallow pride
Swallow all these hollow tips
Sneak diss
Lil Peep pull up with the stick
So icy goth boi's band boys make noise
They tried to call me soft but they can't
These niggas ain't real but they hate
I go hard in the paint put my life on the line
Imma shine till I die, Imma ride till I die
You say you go through hell to get to paradise
I try and I swear that she a lie
I won't cuff, I won't touch her
Pass a bitch to my brother
Even though I really love her
I wish I didn't love her
I just wanna see her shine
She just want some white wine

[Hook: Lil Peep]
Fell in love with the wrong one
I got pills on me, CHXPO keep a long gun
We ain't even trying to start nothing
Please don't do something, I might have to prove something
I'ma die with my pride on my back, that's a fact
I got cold blood, I got cold act
I'ma ride, I'ma die, if I lack get my ass whacked
Pray I don't go out like that

[Verse 2: CHXPO]
I be out in the rain
Can you feel my pain
I might pull up with the gang
I might let that choppa bang
She don't wanna fuck my bands
She just wanna fuck my pain
She just wanna glo up
I'm just tryna come up
????
Even though I'm from the slums
I love the bitch even tho she a slut
????
You get shot sneak dissin on the squad
Like you know how we ball
Goth Boys Band Boys
Bitch we on top
????
????
Bitch we let the choppas bang
She don't wanna fuck my bands
She just wanna fuck my pain
That bitch stay in yo lane
Keep a Glock shook lil bitch a lot of shit'll change
Tell her keep the change
Baby you gon keep the change
Baby you ain't got no change
