[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I've been poppin' pills, I've been tryna forget 'bout you
But honestly, I got regrets 'bout you (I got regrets 'bout you)
Baby, it's over now, you're gonna cry all night
I'm gonna smile at you when I see you and pretend that I'm alright
I'm never sober now, I'm gettin' high all night
I'm 'bout to put this in my system to erase you from my mind

[Verse: Horse Head]
Yeah
I was in lust with you
Thought that I loved you, but I got the two confused
I don't wanna fall asleep with you in my head
And I know that
You regret some things you said
But honestly, I have regrets about you

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I've been poppin' pills, I've been tryna forget 'bout you (tryna forget 'bout you)
But, honestly, I've got regrets 'bout you (I got regrets 'bout you)
Baby, it's over now, you're gonna cry all night
I'm gonna smile at you when I see you and pretend that I'm alright
