[Intro]
Money posse
Rob bank make hits
Lex luger

[Chorus Little Pain]
I just hit the club and I came by myself
I just hit the plug and he came by himself
I just did some drugs I'm ashamed of myself
I'm just trynna numb all the pain that I felt
I just hit the club and I came by myself
I just hit the plug and he came by himself
I just did some drugs I'm ashamed of myself
I'm just trynna numb all the pain that I felt

[Verse Little Pain]
How you gon' try give me advice
When you afraid to live your life
I fucked around and fucked the same chick twice
I fucked around and shed the same tears twice
Cause bitch they try to call me ugly
But she don't know that her best friend be trynna fuck me
I told her only God could judge me
And plus my momma still love me
She probably didn't recognize the reason I go
My durag very red you can't get this at the store
If you need a bag I got them in for the low
Free all my n***as please don't pick up the soap
Shout out little Peep I'm smokin' in with the bro
We gon' need a feat if you ain't up for a show
All my bitches sweeping all my n***as are broke
Everybody's emo man this shit ain't no joke

[Chorus Little Pain]
I just hit the club and I came by myself
I just hit the plug and he came by himself
I just did some drugs I'm ashamed of myself
I'm just trynna numb all the pain that I felt
I just hit the club and I came by myself
I just hit the plug and he came by himself
I just did some drugs I'm ashamed of myself
I'm just trynna numb all the pain that I felt

[Verse Lil Peep]
I just hit the club and I came by myself
I just did some drugs that I jugged off a belt
All these bitches call me in pain, make 'em melt
All these bitches call me a pain, make 'em
Everybody know when I came cause I smell
Everybody know by my name in your town
We be fuckin' hoes after shows
I don't give a fuck about no hoes
All I give a fuck about my bros
All I give a fuck about my doe
All I give a fuck about my clothes
Bout these bands in my bank account
I'm ballin' like I'm broke
I'm ballin' like I'm broke she gave me
Heads, shoulders, knees and toes
Heads, shoulders, knees and toes
Every day a week a hoe
Ballin' like I'm broke she gave me
Heads, shoulders, knees and toes
Fuck me for no reason hoe

[Chorus Little Pain]
I just hit the club and I came by myself
I just hit the plug and he came by himself
I just did some drugs I'm ashamed of myself
I'm just trynna numb did some drugs I'm ashamed of myself
I'm just trynna numb all the pain that I felt
