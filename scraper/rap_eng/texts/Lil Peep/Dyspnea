[Intro: LiL PEEP]
If it's my own life on the line then it's fine
By me cause my time is fading
I got five hoes right by my side
They wanna die with me but I'm tired of waiting

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
If it's my own life on the line then it's fine by me cause my time is fading
I got five hoes right by my side
They wanna die with me but I'm tired of waiting
Leave me alone
I'ma go tonight

[Verse 1: Chano Migs]
Riding with that word, bruh
Riding west of violence
In my eye lens, I could hurt ya
High, on autopilot like my diet strictly percs, bruh
Riding, coinciding with the feelings that I'm sending with
Smoking and supplying
Don't deny it kid I been the shit
Now the dope dividing
Moving silent like a syndicate
Broken when I die instead of defying all that's infinite

[Bridge: LiL PEEP]
I don't even want to fuck right now
If you really want to you could fuck me
I will never put my double cup down
If you really want to you could drug me
I ain't never gonna warn my town
I'ma kill everybody
I'ma bounce
I don't ever gotta talk that loud
Everybody get quiet as a mouse

[Verse 2: Chano Migs]
Welcome to another day in paradise
Fucking bad bitches
Save a re-up with a pair of dice
Fuck with savages
Tell 'em Gee, yo
That ain't real advice
Used to have wishes but I witness at a better height
With the addicts in the attic
Used to be the weekend
Turned into a habit
Dreaming I was peaking with my homie, tatted
Now he selling schemes Self-esteem a bit dramatic
So when we talking statics, that's really every day
As we speak I got a Blake that says he needs that eighth quick
My paranoia peaking
Think they trynna get my face split
That paranoia screaming like "hey, where the fuck that bake slip?"
With the same clip, motherfucker
Not the same game or same bitch but I'll fuck her
Drug one another
Double cup filled
Caught a buzz with my brother
They gooder got pills so that blue was the color, uh

[Hook: LiL PEEP]
If it's my own life on the line then it's fine by me cause my time is fading
I got five hoes right by my side
They wanna die with me but I'm tired of waiting
Leave me alone
I'ma go tonight

[Verse 3: Chano Migs]
Buy the ticket take the ride, lil homie
Take a hit of this shit, you won’t die feeling lonely
Take a line of sniff, you’ll feel alive if you’re only you
Buy the ticket take the ride, lil homie
Kick it with your mans
Catch a vibe with me slowly
Crush a couple xans
If I die, you ain’t know me
Miscount the milligrams
Killin friends if they OD

[Bridge: LiL PEEP]
I don't even want to fuck right now
If you really want to you could fuck me
I will never put my double cup down
If you really want to you could drug me
I ain't never gonna warn my town
I'ma kill everybody
I'ma bounce
I don't ever gotta talk that loud
Everybody get quiet as a mouse (Really quiet like a)


[Verse 4: Chano Migs]
Mouse
Moving funny through the trap house
Think you getting cheese but you’re really in the cat’s house
Think you ‘bouta leave, drag you back to pull your cash out
Get that how you need
Cop a bag to seal your past out
Till you pass out off the xanax
All the thirty milligram blues make you vanish
Cause nobody really can choose when demanded
Killing like a million goons
They can’t stand it
The bandit that single handedly left you stranded
They candidly brought the xan with me when I landed
No sanity
Got my fan with me
Welcome, Andy
Humanity
Got some grass in me
But that’s ranting
She says I’m so romantic
Yeah I love you, boo
Got her feeling real high off the drugs we do
Got her feeling my vibe yeah I fucks with you
She breaks the Swisher down for me then she tucks it too
Fuck with me

[Bridge: LiL PEEP]

I'ma kill everybody

I don't ever gotta talk that loud
Everybody get quiet as a mouse
