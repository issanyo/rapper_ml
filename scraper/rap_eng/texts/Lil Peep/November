Lyrics From Snippet

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Peep]
... as long as i remember
I left you cold in December
You watched me break and don't say a thing
You can't hear a thing so I scream out

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I'm all alone in November
She's never here when I need her
I try a lot, not cry a lot
I'm trying hard not to bleed out

[Verse 1 : iLoveMakonnen]
You won't give your love
But I keep making room for us
And you wanna gain my trust
So...
