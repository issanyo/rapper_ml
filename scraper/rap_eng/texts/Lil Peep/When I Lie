[Intro]
All they do is try
Woke up on a lonely day
She can’t help but wonder why, yeah
Punk star

[Hook]
Many men have tried to save her but all they do is try (All they do is try)
Woke up on a lonely day, she can’t help but wonder why? (But wonder why)
I saw it on her face, she wants to make those fuckers cry (Those fuckers cry)
She ends up in a better place and time when she get high
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind (Peace of mind)
I’m not evil by design, but I feel dead at times (Dead at times)
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind (Peace of mind)
Stick that needle in my eye

[Verse]
She won’t come with me (Come with me)
She ain’t gonna run with me (Run with me)
Now I’m breaking down again (Now I'm breaking down again)
Blue skies start turning grey, when I tell her that I’m fine (Her that I'm fine)
Ash on the windowpane can I kiss you on your spine? (Kiss you on your spine)
I watched her walk away, but don’t tell me she ain’t mine (Tell me she ain't mine)
She’s got this little blade and she cuts me when I lie (Cuts me when I lie)
When I lie
Cuts me when I lie
When I lie, yeah

Woke up on a lonely day, she can’t help but wonder why? (But wonder why)
I saw it on her face, she wants to make those fuckers cry (Those fuckers cry)
She ends up in a better place inside when she get high
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind (Peace of mind)
I’m not evil by design, but I feel dead at times (Dead at times)
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind (Peace of mind)
Stick that needle in my eye

Cuts me when I lie
When I lie
Cuts me when I lie
