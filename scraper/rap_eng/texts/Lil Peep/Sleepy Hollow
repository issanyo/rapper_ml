[Chorus: LiL PEEP]
Girl, it's my time now, I'm 'bout to ride out
Let these pussy boys know that I'm back (bitch)
She can find me at the hideout
GHOSTEMANE with me got a couple dead bitches with the knives out
Let my mind out
I'm goin' crazy, baby
I'ma make it happen, 'cause I ain't lazy, baby
I just wanna find my way to hell and then I never wanna leave
I throw the wish in the well

[Verse: GHOSTEMANE]
You act like you know me [?]
When you never wanna fuck with anybody without a name
I can't really say that I'ma hit you with a bang
Or the days I would do the very same thing
But the only thing is I'ma never say no shit like me
Bitch I'm straight
Schema the posse [?] enter your brain, bitch
I never wanna see the inside of an office again
I promise I ain't never stackin' for [?]
Take home some hoe shit It's hopeless
Hocus pocus and now you hopeless now you know its bogus
When I holla at demons
Bitch, I told you I'm that KREEP ain't no jokin' with ya

[Bridge: LiL PEEP]
If I had one night with you
I would lock you in my room
They can't tell me what to do
Baby, it's all up to me now

[Chorus: LiL PEEP]
Girl, its my time now, I'm 'bout to ride out
Let these pussy boys know that I'm back (bitch)
She can find me at the hideout
GHOSTEMANE with me got a couple dead bitches with the knives out
Let my mind out
I'm goin' crazy, baby
I'ma make it happen, cause I ain't lazy, baby
I just wanna find my way to hell and then I never wanna leave
I throw the wish in the well
