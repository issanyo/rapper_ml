[Intro: Juno & Mac MacGuff: Juno Movie (2007)]
"You're looking a little morose sunny, what's hitting you?"
"Just like losing my faith with humanity.."
"Can you narrow it down for me?"
"I just, wonder, if like.. two people can stay together for good?"
"You mean like couples?"
"Yaknow.. like, people in love.."
"Are you having boys trouble? 'cause I gotta be honest, I don't really much approve of you dating in your condition.. that's kinda messed up.."
"No dad, it's not"
"I mean that's pretty skanky.. isn't that what you girls call it skanky? skeevy?
"Please stop"
"Tore up from the floor up?"
"That's just not what it's about... I just need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever"
"Well, it's not easy, that's for sure."

[Hook: Lil Peep]
We could run away
Leave this little town
If you had to wait, would you stick around?
We are not the same,  if you couldn't tell
It's just another day in this little town (Leave this little town)
We could run away
Leave this little town
If you had to wait, would you stick around?
We are not the same, if you couldn't tell
It's just another day in this little town (Leave this little town)
