[Chorus]
Leave me alone
Just leave me alone
I’m growin' so tired of this
How do you fight the feelin'?
How do you fight the feelin', bitch?
She callin' my phone
She callin' my phone, I put it on quiet quick
I ain’t never gon’ answer it
I ain’t never gon’ pick up my phone girl

[Verse]
I’m all on my own
I’m all on my own
I know you ain’t high as this
Puttin' my mind to shit
Give me some time I be flyin' bitch
Breakin' my bones
You breakin' my bones you want me to line my wrist
I ain’t gon’ do it for you
I’m gon’ do it for me, 'cause it help me forget
I ain’t gon’ do it for you
I’m gon’ do it for me 'cause I'm tryna get rich
I ain’t gon put on my tommy
If I on't got tommy to put on my bitch
I’m doin' my thing
And bitch I can sing so don’t expect all my fucks I just switch
Step in this bitch let these hoes feel my drip
If you ain’t smokin' on somethin' I'ma dip (skrt)

[Chorus]
Leave me alone
Just leave alone
I’m growin' so tired of this
How do you fight the feelin'?
How do you fight the feelin', bitch?
She callin' my phone
She callin' my phone, I put it on quiet quick
I ain’t never gon’ answer it
I ain’t never gon’ pick up my phone girl

[Outro]
When you are on your own
Just know that I love you
I won't pick up the phone
Just know that I need you
