[Intro: Lil Peep]
I can't feel, can't feel my face numb
My face now, yeah
I can't have no bitch, I gotta wait for her
(I can't feel...)

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
I can't feel my face, my face numb
High speed police chase my race car
Cocaine laced up all-white A1's
Steak sauce, gotta a couple snakes, I'ma break off
I can't have no bitch, I gotta wait for her
I got friends with the way I don't chase plugs
Mackned brought some so I gotta take some
Goop got big guns, please don't fake nun
I can't feel my face, my face numb
High speed police chase my race car
Cocaine laced up all-white A1's
Steak sauce, gotta a couple snakes, I'ma break off
I can't have no bitch, I gotta wait for her
I got friends with the weight, I don't chase plugs
Mackned brought some so I gotta take some
Goop got big guns, please don't fake nun

[Verse 1: KirbLaGoop]
How your drank turn that colour?
You gon' kill for yo brother? You really there for that cutter?
You ain't really from the under
Had to go and serve yo uncle just so you could feed yo mother
I put the game on check
I put these rappers on a check, my OG I respect
(That's why I spit, boy)
They ain't playing with that bag
They ain't never ever had, all these rappers really fags
Yo white hoe do the most
I could never ever go, never get away for my soul
Boy, you know I still pour
All that shit that I saw, that shit haunt me like a ghost
I got some demons in my mind
You ain't never heard it in yo head to go commit the crime
I got some secrets, that I gots to keep
I gots to deal with this here daily till I'm buried deep

[Verse 2: Mackned]
Like that 4-5, that big pole, that boom-bap, that hip hop
Them big bands, that Slipknot, I mix match
Shoot a nigga in the eyepatch
Baby girl, you sold that cat for me, hoe
Aye, ooh, gold rings on me, no Smeagol
My dawg mixing up the kibble with the rice bowl
He bad, eating lightning hoe, he light up like a light bulb
Ooh, yeah, stack that mozzarella, check a big bag
Smack it for an hour, off a thirty, let a bitch bad
I can't have no bitch I gotta fake for
She play games with me, I start a world war
Cocaine lined up, drugs is what I came for
I treat pussy like I used to treat kicked doors
Roxycodone and I'm blowing strong, ooh
He can't feel his face because his face is gone, ooh
Dada then I make sure KirbLaGoop is home, yah
My shooters gon' hit you like it's after prom, Mackned

[Outro: Lil Peep]
I can't feel my face, my face numb
