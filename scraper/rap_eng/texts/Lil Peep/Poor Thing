[Chorus: Jaxxon D. Silva]
I've been getting by thanks to a thing or two
I've got a thing for a poor thing I'm such a fool, yeah
Love don't work, what it do, boo?
Love don't work, love just desert you, whoa
I'm seeing red, my cup is full of meds
I might hit her mans, fuck her mans, I'm the man
Love don't work but the xans do
Love don't work but I got a thing or two to do, yuh

[Verse 1: Jaxxon D. Silva]
Love don't work, it should've stayed in school
I don't even work but I'm in the field
Love is in the air so I'm blowing smoke
Love don't listen, Cupid an asshole
I'm in the field like a scarecrow
I only want the neck, I'ma bad host
But she still a bad hoe
All I got is oh well

[Chorus: Jaxxon D. Silva]
I've been getting by thanks to a thing or two
I've got a thing for a poor thing I'm such a fool, yeah
Love don't work, what it do, boo?
Love don't work, love just desert you, whoa
I'm seeing red, my cup is full of meds
I might hit her mans, fuck her mans, I'm the man
Love don't work but the xans do
Love don't work but I got a thing or two to do, yuh

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
I had that white girl on me, now it's in my nose
I had that white girl shopping, buying all my clothes
Lil Peep too faded, I ain't going home
Now she doing cocaine on my iPhone
When I die, with the Devil where I'm gonna go
I don't lie, I don't tell her when I'm fucking hoes
I get high, pop a seal and I pour a fo'
I get high for the pain, you would never know
You would never know, you would never know
I get high for the pain, you would never know
Where you wanna go? Where you wanna go?
I could fly, I could take you where you wanna go
What you wanna know? What you wanna know?
I be rolling, I be geeking off that good coke
Put it on my soul, put it on my soul
Ain't nobody fucking with me and my fucking bros

[Chorus: Jaxxon D. Silva]
I've been getting by thanks to a thing or two
I've got a thing for a poor thing I'm such a fool, yeah
Love don't work, what it do, boo?
Love don't work, love just desert you, whoa
I'm seeing red, my cup is full of meds
I might hit her mans, fuck her mans, I'm the man
Love don't work but the xans do
Love don't work but I got a thing or two to do, yuh
