[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
Ice cold glass of dope (Ice cold glass of dope)
Fuck around crash the boat (Fuck around crash the boat)
I feel like I'm past it hoe (I feel like I'm past it hoe)
I just want the ass and go (I just want the ass and go)

[Hook]
Gimme that body
I'ma put it on mine
I got a 12 gauge shotty with my name on the side
When I pull up to the party all these bitches gone run
I been going so retarded that I might lose my mind

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
Schemaposse in this hoe
And you can tell by the vibe
You don't want to find out that we got nothing to hide
I'm a mosh pit God
I got black on my eyes
Break a bad bitch spine cause my (bleeped out)
I'ma pull up on you tonight
I'ma let you know how I feel
Maybe we can have one last fight
I ain't trippin' I'm just keepin' it real
I'ma pull off in that Lamborghini Murcielago
I wasn't lying when I said
"They can't go to the place that I go"

[Bridge]
She said
"Am I going to hell?"
One look in my eyes she could tell
She said
"Am I going to hell?"
One look in my eyes she could tell

[Hook]
Gimme that body
I'ma put it on mine
I got a 12 gauge shotty with my name on the side
When I pull up to the party all these bitches gone run
I been going so retarded that I might lose my mind

[Verse 3: Ghostemane]
Cut em up thin, cut em up thick
Pullin' up to the dope that 9TD
Throw my body bag to the bottom of the trash heap
I'm a creep so they don't believe me
Only thing I really wanna be is 6 feet deep
When I wake in the AM
[?] and it's harder to breathe
They told me the sign [?] December the night
About to the biggest bottom [?]
[?] then lace it with cyanide
Fucking with nothing but [?]
Schema the posse
A posse of demons
You'll see when you look in my eyes
