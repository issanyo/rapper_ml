[Verse: Lil Peep]
When I'm comin' down
The lights will brighten
And the noise rings in my head
Did I let you down again?
(Did I let you down again)
If I leave here now
It won't feel right
With somebody else in my bed
And I'm breakin' down again
(Breakin' down again)
But If I need to go
Just to show you I don't fuckin' care
If you don't give a shit bout me at all
You little bitch
That's cool with me
So act like you don't know
That I don't fuckin' stare at anybody else
The way I do when it's only me and you

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
You know it's me, you know it's me, you know it's me, you know it's me
You know it's me, you know it's me, you know it's me, you know it's me
It's me

[Outro: Lacey Sturm]
My arms are searchin' for you
My arms are out stretched towards you
I feel you on my finger tips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for you
