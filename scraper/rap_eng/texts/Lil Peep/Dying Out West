[Hook: Lil Peep]
All this stress
Look at this mess
Look at my head, I'm better off dead
Dyin' out west
Tryin' my best
Layin' in bed, I was comin' down then
No more pain, locked away
I go insane, I'm so insane
In my brain everyday, I go insane
I'm so insane
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight

[Verse: Lil Tracy]
Look in the mirror
I see a demon, I'm barely breathing
My shadow is bleeding
On the highway, baby, I'm speeding
I'm leavin' the city, you should be with me
Two weeks with the same old jeans on
I know you want to die, baby, this is your theme song
Like a switchblade, baby, just hold on
Like a switchblade, baby, just hold on

[Hook: Lil Peep]
All this stress
Look at this mess
Look at my head, I'm better off dead
Dyin' out west
Tryin' my best
Layin' in bed, I was comin' down then
No more pain, locked away
I go insane, I'm so insane
In my brain everyday, I go insane
I'm so insane
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight
I'm goin' home tonight
