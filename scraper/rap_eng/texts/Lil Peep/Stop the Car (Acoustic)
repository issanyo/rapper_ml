[Hook]
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up again

[Verse 1]
And if I don't break your heart
And if you don't break my heart
I can feel the passion from the start
Girl, its your life, baby, I just wanna play a part
Real Gothbois like it in the dark, real Gothbois like it in the dark
I can feel the passion from the start
Ever since I met her I don't wanna be apart

[Hook]
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?

[Verse 2]
So I stopped the car, I don't need nobody
Just the cracks of my heart, I've been feelin' lonely
Silver chains in my heart, I've been caught up
Just take me away I give it all up
So I left the scene, heart beatin' so loud
Why you runnin' away, I need you right now
Silver chains in my heart, like I was so down, like I was so down

[Hook]
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?

[Verse 3]
I wish I had a heart to break
And a body that could carry this weight
And a mind that could bury this shame
It's still Gothboiclique til my soul take
And I was in the background
Head down
Pass me around every part of town
Just take me away from the bottle now
It's like chains
You still dream of me callin' your name
You're still askin' me if you'll be okay
And we're still drivin' to your place like it's safe

[Hook]
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up
I told her stop the car
I gotta say somethin'
I've been thinkin' about you every single day for the past few months
Did I say too much, did I ask too much?
Got me all fucked up
Got me all fucked up again
