Okay, I'm taking you deep on my mind cavern, I'm rocking this tradition
Poppin a … and robbin your hitchmen slow
Pain
You feel then I'm dealin a rhyme pattern and ain’t stopping, ain’t no quit, and hoppin a ... and homina stripping now

Back in a second
The wacky tabacky cracking my back, I’m sacking the quarterback a fucking way at your boy
Javelin  then in your Adam's apple go ask your mom
Tracks your rappers with the fragments of a fucking Adam’s bomb
I spit  an easy flow

Breaker, breaker shape fax copy I made west cocky

I'm pushing back a line back I got CTE

I was born a manitha, cloud my speaker
Now drown in the [nitha]
My now bounced to the beats, and I'm down south in a beat
I bowed down with a [visa]
My round house is procedure, with loud apps as a cave
Don't let Benny take your mini, she's the keeper, assured us up whenever stars are underneath
I see your meal, you mother fuckers running deep of working hard to catch the next trash street suite
Once you've been in this tennis and then I know tomorrow, I'm dependent independent from house to end of bar
Flow decking and how yucky might be a model
I'm just trying to be flying up from down to [unintelligible 00:01:40] bottom
Full throttle, I'm speaking tonight to fight the riches
Out in the rap to do trap and sense a white guilt
Now I'm just saying I can't even get paid for mic weapon
I make enough to keep power though when the lights which is
Only if Y'all come bow down, I'll be up on that stage if only ma can see me now. How to get the paper was as lethal as it sounds, but I’ll be running the [unintelligible 00:01:58] my demons and me now

I might have to stand up on the pulpit, so ain't nobody else got to do this bullshit
I dropped out at every institution from here to Malibu like I was parachuting
Cause tried to keep me in lines, it kinda wasting your time, and screaming back at a map for trying to give me a sign
And Mama always told me, “Baby, you’re just different. So, don't ever smoothen out your edges.”
I'm a square peg in a black hole
Brought her run away baby I had a place to go, and that's a life story sieve it in the cargo
Never look into the wrist, it maybe the bottle
People acting out of fear like they in [Zombie film] but I'm giving you a message inside a bottle
You say populate might see McDonald's
I just want something real in my soap and follow
All gone
