"our passion hasn't died that's for sure
But this lens I'm looking at you through still cracked and blurred, burn, the letters that I wrote
I'm sick of spoon feeding every measurement of hope
I'm broken on the inside your pretty on the outside
Sitting with your mouth wide, open lettin chaos spew from it
I will stomach it but only to a certain extent
Everything is not a god damn emergence quit
Quit trying to thrive on the problems that you don't have
Blaming all the men that you drove mad Aiming at the chain when you throw jabs, get yourself a knockout
I'd rather peel my own scabs and walked out
I walk here in place till I can't taste the fragrance
What used to be fresh became the same shit
Its just the same shit everyday face it
I still never once said in increment of time was wasted
I love you so brightly turned to fuck you politely turn the rain clouds to thunder and lightning turned to I just need a couple days of space turned to hi, if I get a Diamond it'll be the shape of your eyes, turn to I wanna marry you and trace you the skies, turns to I just need a couple days of space now to write, turned to fuck you in passing, I used to kind of love you with passion, turned to why can't we anchor this shit to the ground, spin me around tell I'm dizzy, you say that disrepair is the reason that your pissy, I gotta be the man that isn't there quite frankly because my mouth is air tight lately, can't breathe, I can't believe I'm breaking my own rules, this is not in love song though, I just need a place to mark my words because your dark sky serge swallowed all those little bar fly birds, so if I die 5 minutes from now, tell the world I never loved it because no one ever showed me how, anonymous forever, I'm trying not to miss it, I never smile cause I think it makes me look desperate, impressed with my speech still I'm not good with goodbyes, I rested my feet up on the hot hood to look wise, but there is not an engine in the car and all the pistons are configured to my heart, and the radio is wired to my tummy I can listen to my hunger and it's yellin mother fucker we ain't getting any younger and you're yelling mother to your children, I want to mother yours, and that's a statement that's underscored and I stand there smiling looking for an exit, desperately trying to flee free from your death kiss, and it's a death kiss cause new life is involved, 9 months later when I screw tight a lit bulb and look at a grocery store lane or a plane and I see a child screaming that beares my last name, we stretched a wild weekend and turned it into an 18 year burden, made this here person, its better than it sounds I look him in the eyes and I frown and I tell him that I'll always be around and I look you in the eyes and I smile and I tell you that I'll always be around at least a while at least for now cause that's my style and that's what separates fucking from making love, fucking's about the sex, making loves about the body hug, you gotta tug less baby I can promise you this we'll come together as one I promise you this."
