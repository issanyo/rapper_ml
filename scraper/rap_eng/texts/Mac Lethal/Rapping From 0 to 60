[Intro]
My therapist said that when I'm angry, all I gotta do is close my eyes and count to 60
So:

[Verse]
Don't be a 0
Everybody take 1 second
To make a number 2 with your fingers
But like this, and not like this
For 3 different reasons that I'm fortified
The force, the foresight
And after 4 is 5
I'm thinking of 6-6-6
This heaven
I looked at the 8 ball, it said I skipped 7
But I got 9 lives
10 ways to dream
Telekinetic like 11 from Stranger Things
I got a 12 gauge pumped
'Cuz for 13 months
It's been 14 degrees out in L.A. what?!
Turned 15, then I got a learner's permit
Lit 16 candles and burned the surface
Spent 17k on an 18-wheeler
Moved 19 keys, Pablo made me dealer
20 years ago I'm packing a clip in
Buck! Buck! And shoot
Fuck with me I swear I'm giving a 21 gun salute
Coming through with the .22
#23--I'm the Jumpman
For 24 hours I've been drunk, man
25 cents used to get you a phone call
Ran 26 miles and I kicked through a stone wall
Didn't join the 27 Club
But I rode 28 inch rims, and of course it was fun
Takes Saturn 29 years to orbit the Sun
Want beef? Imma put a fucking fork in it: done
I'm so lyrical
I'm the baddest motherfucker on the planet
Everybody just can't stand it
When you listen to me you'll cry real tears
That was 30 syllables
31 flavors
Franklin D. Roosevelt was the 32nd President
I'm not the President
I'm the king
But they killed me at age 33 to prove that I was heaven-sent
No miracles on 34th Street
I took 35 mm film to the 36th Chamber
Bumping Wu-Tang, pissing off my neighbors
They built a 37 foot wall in Mexico
39 bullets in my .38 Special, bro
What you got on my 40, homie?
41 cents? I'll be robbing him
42. Robinson, Jackie
Richard Petty, #43
I got the the power of a .44 Maggie
Spent 45 minutes singing Psalm 46
But the 47th Ronin came and tried to slash me
For homicide detectives, the clock starts ticking the moment that they're called
The chances of solving a murder are cut in half if they don't get a lead within the first 48 hours
Fuck you to the 49th power
I was listening to 50 Cent out in Area 51 cruising in a pick-up
Who wants to play a game of 52 card pick up?
53 players on the field
Studio 54
I ain't staying very still
55 I'll make you Juniors say, "ow!"
56 curls in Shirley Temple's hair, say, "wow!"
In a '57 Chevy
With a 58-year-old with 59 gallons of whiskey
My therapist said that when I'm angry, all I gotta do is close my eyes and count to 60 (x3)

[Outro]
Man I like fucked up at the end
How am I gonna fuck up at the very end?
I'm just keeping this shit
Have a good week, y'all
