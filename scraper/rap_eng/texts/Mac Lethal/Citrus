Hey citrus, hey liquor
I love it when you touch each other
Hey whiskey, hey ginger
I come to you with rigid fingersI see Judas in the hard eyes of the boys working the corners
I feel Jesus in the clumsiness of young and awkward loversHey barroom, hey tavern
I find hope in all the souls you gather
Hey citrus, hey liquor
I love it when we come togetherI feel Jesus in the clumsiness of young and awkward lovers
I feel Judas in the long odds of the rackets on the corners
I feel Jesus in the tenderness of honest nervous lovers
I feel Judas in the pistols and the pagers that come with all the powdersLost in fog and love and faithless fear
I've had kisses that make Judas seem sincere
Lost in fog and love and faithless fear
I've had kisses that make Judas seem sincereLost in fog and love and faithless fear
I've had kisses that make Judas seem sincere
Lost in fog and love and faithless fear
I've had kisses that make Judas seem sincere
