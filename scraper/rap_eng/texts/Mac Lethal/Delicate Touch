[Intro]


[Hook]

Freedom tastes good on my tongue
Like a piece of twenty five cent bubblegum
So numb to the rush, so numb to the delicate touch
This is your delicate touch
And she says "listen to yourself
I just wanna be there, sickness and in health, nothing else"
There ain't no rush
This is my delicate touch
This is my delicate touch


[Verse I]

Crazy
Stress-pot pretty
Drivin' round lost in the city
I say it so simply
Autumn is ablaze, dead leaves and black fire
I'm walkin tiptoe, overtop a quagmire
No more cat and mouse, now I help pick paint colors for the house
Pop the cork, I might strip another screw
Love...is when you miss somebody that's sitting right in front of you
I get it indeed, you're a different breed
With different needs
You touch my heart, and your fingertip bleeds
I'm sorry that it's sharp to the touch and my heart doesn't gush
And I do not listen
Male traits
When a new plot thickens, stalemate
Cannot move another piece from the pieces that we shatter to
Til we hold hands walkin up the avenue
Midnight stroll. Grip tight hold
Got two black aces but I just might fold
This last name should be your last name
(Hold on let me say that again.)
Ok midnight stroll
Grip tight hold, I don't wanna play games
I just might fold
This last name should be your last name
I say these vows in vain


[Hook]

Freedom tastes good on my tongue
Like a piece of twenty five cent bubblegum
So numb to the rush, so numb to the delicate touch
This is your delicate touch
And she says "listen to yourself
I just wanna be there, sickness and in health, nothing else"
There ain't no rush
This is my delicate touch
This is my delicate touch


[Verse II]

If I had one word to describe, you and me together
It would be "alive"
I am so alive, but I could sit here and just die
My life is unbuttoned, heart strings untie
Tangled in your hair
Like a dreamy boy with a blanket
Waitin at the stairs
You're different parts, that I soak 'til my lips are parched
With spongey words and a kiss that's tart
This ain't a love life, this is art
Those little quirks that I pick apart
We went from making up shit like three month anniversaries
To sick fights
From speculation to dreams
Of givin' you mixed cd's and wedding rings
I dont' wanna crush, I'd rather build
Keep everything in a shoe box except those heels
For the midnight stroll, grip tight hold
Get a blanket when the sun sets it gets quite cold
This last name should be your last name
I'ma let you rush into my veins


[Hook x2]

Freedom tastes good on my tongue
Like a piece of twenty five cent bubblegum
So numb to the rush, so numb to the delicate touch
This is your delicate touch
And she says "listen to yourself
I just wanna be there, sickness and in health, nothing else"
There ain't no rush
This is my delicate touch
This is my delicate touch
