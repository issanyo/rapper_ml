I had a lucid dream
That’s a dream you can control
And in this dream, all I did is stay alive forever
I’m not going to wake up ‘til the day we die together
And Satan writes a letter to me sayin’ life forever

Sometimes you gotta wound yourself so you can heal somethin’
I’d rather feel sadness than feel nothing
A knot up in your stomach means that something reals comin’
I’d rather feel that than feel nothin’
Sometimes I break down and cry when I think about my dad’s death
But my dad has never died
He’s alive and sleetin’ blood down in hail, that’s the weather
I take a sewing needle, stitch myself back together
I’m sleep deprived and hung over but at least alive
The rhythm of the world and me were never synchronized
It’s printed on my medication bottle
Mix some alcohol with this and that’s a better way to wobble

Toggle forces. White queens, black horses
One tally for every smile Mac forces
Scratch it on the prison wall
Being a father is not that difficult. Be a man. Get involved
Hit the abortion and the methadone clinic, need to kill two birds, find a stepping stone, pick it up, throw it
Just because I got the white boy voice and some big words don’t mean I’m a poet, I’m a gangster

Spin the dreidel baby, spin the driedel, this is therapy for gangsters

I had a lucid dream, that’s a dream you can control and in this dream, all I did is stay alive forever. I’m not going to wake up ‘til the day we die together and Satan writes a letter to me sayin’ life is precious
