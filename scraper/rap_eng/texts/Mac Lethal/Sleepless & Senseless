(Verse 1)
Yeah, this is all about your life
I guess it's all about mine too
There's a weird vibe in the city right now, I can feel it every time, that I drive through
Got married to the struggles, said "I do"
That beautiful bitch, yeah, she's mine
But I took another ambien and drank another double IPA, and now I promise Imma be fine
Hold up
Just hung another list of my goals up
I'd rather die than be la-zy
Gotta treat every second of my life, on Earth, like it's valuable. Fuck what it pays me
I don't want to live my life safe-ly
But I don't think there people that I work with seem to understand that every time I come up in the office, that the motha-fuckin gun up in my pocket is off safety
I need to go to the beach and relax, take a nice, warm sun shower
Congratulations, you got off work
Now you gotta deal with rush-hour
Who the hell lied to society and said that, this is right and  said this is life and said, if you wanna have a nice kids and wife
It's all sleepless nights and all senseless fights and all..


(Chorus)
Sleepless nights. Senseless fights.(x8)

(Verse 2)
So perfect
If I make 10 million dollars those fancy cars, and that jewelry, I won't purchase
I'll move my family to the woods and buy a cabin and communicate through only post service
So the problem, stress, drama, and mess of everyday life won't surface
I know so many people that have graduated college and they sit around out of work, biiitch
I know so many people that are 25 and older and they just feel downright worth-less
I wish that I can tell you that there's gonna be a day where the adult life bullshit we deal with'll all stop
But we start over the cycle on the December the thrity-first a new years eve the very second that the ball dropped
One last breath
The sooner that you realize that every one of us is crazy is the sooner you can find a little symmetry
And try to direct your energy to all the little things you go through daily
And the Universe it never will apologize for making you experience the things you've experienced
I think the biggest fear is that it's really all for nothing, man, I'm serious
I'm sick of always wakin' up and dealing with the feelings of the..

(Chorus)
Sleepless nights. Senseless fights
