[Chorus]
I write song
I love you like one apple
This song is dedication
I am smile, uyou are my puppy
I want to put my love on you
You have sexyest body
You eat many meals a day
I congratulate you

[Verse]
You love Dev, but he is very angry boy
I wish to hold u tite
And pleasure u in my house
I will b a shepperd
I will keep u in my house
When u talk to Dev
I cry to mother for many nights
God smiles down on you & me
I will b yur husband
We will get marryed
That day will b one happy day
We must not divorce
This day will make me sad
I write this poem
I am thogtful, Dev is not thogtful
Ahww u r sad
Cry on one sholder
I will bring u diner
It wil hav binifits
We will make the luv and hav many childs
But you must lern
I am boss
I am teacher of are childs

[Chorus]
I write song
I love you like one apple
This song is dedication
I am smile, uyou are my puppy
I want to put my love on you
You have sexyest body
You eat many meals a day
I congratulate you, yo
I write song
I love you like one apple
This song is dedication
I am smile, uyou are my puppy
I want to put my love on you
You have sexyest body
You eat many meals a day
I congratulate you

[Outro]
Dev, you're a bitch
