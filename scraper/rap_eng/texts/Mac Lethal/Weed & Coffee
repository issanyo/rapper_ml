[ Intro ]
Yo, uh

[ Verse 1 ]
I don't drive a Bentley, or a Benz or a Beamer
I don't drive an Audi or a Lamborghini either
I don't push a range round town just to act paid
Only money that i got is change in my ashtray
I don't drive a Porsche
I don't drive a rolls royce
I don't drive feraris
I don't even drive a volvo
Wanna get up in my car you have to squeeze
Because my motherfucking car is Japanese
I drive a Honda
And no sir i did not lease i bought a god damn honda
I be getting Whole Foods bitches
You be getting Olive Garden bitches with the bronzer
I own a Honda
Spent the extra money on a vaporizer for my marijuana
Grip that steering wheel
Irish boy with a mean left hand looking like Conor
Picture me rolling in a Toyota Corolla with 100,000 miles
Im a veteran nothing to play with
This one for the Nissans and Kias
And the Hyundais or Hun-dais or the however the fuck you say it
Rappers always spending their money on these pricey ass automobiles
Looking like idiots
I'm from the midwest with enough bad weather to impress
I don't want a nice car
Not even a little bit



[Chorus]
All I really care about is cruising through the city
With my windows down so back the hell up off me
All I wanna do is wake up early in the morning
Smoke a little weed and drink some fucking coffee
Yeah



Verse 2
I don't ever do hard drugs
Just moderate drinking
Lately I've been trying to be sober during the weekend
Exercising every single day for my good health
Lower the anxiety that I feel being my good self
I don't need sweets
I don't need fried food
Grass fed butter in my coffee is a great brew
If one apple a day would keep the doctor away
Then imagine what would happen if you ate two

I used to feel the pressure
'til i learned a couple lessons
Living life and always stressing
Had no answer to my question
Started thinking about the poison
I put up inside of my physical body
Came to the conclusion
Living healthy is an essence
Man, I gotta have the energy
To be a better father
Gotta focus
So i could put a couple dollars in a closed fist
Smoke a little marijuana
Never smoke cigs
And exercise so I don't grow tits
Lift weights
Compound movements
Leg day
Deep squats
Drop down, do it
Build your skills and find yourself a career
Can't be 35 still living at your mom's house stupid
I got friends that got habits that are so bad
I guarantee they're gonna die of a heart attack
You gotta make choices that positively benefit you
For fucks sake how hard is that


[Chorus]
All I really care about is cruising through the city
With my windows down so back the hell up off me
All I wanna do is wake up early in the morning
Smoke a little weed and drink some fucking coffee
Yeah

[ Verse 3 ]
For the first time in my life
I can see myself with my eyes closed
I can see the things that I hide from the world
I can see the things that only time shows
So what has time shown?
Time has shown
That every single person I have known
Is gonna suffer everyday and die alone (2x)

For the first time in my life
I can see myself with my eyes closed
I can see the things that I hide from the world
I can see the things that only time shows
So what has time shown?
Time has shown
That every single person I have known
Is gonna suffer everyday if they don't have weed and coffee






[ Outro ]

Uh. caffeine and weed are drugs too mac

Shut the fuck up
