[Intro]
I'm not exactly sure why white rappers
Are such a hot commoditity in my interviews
Look, man... some white rappers are good...
But just like most rappers...
Most white rappers SUCK!
Ayo

[Verse 1]
Mister Mister M. dot, L. dot
Used to sell pot
Now I send my merchandise into your mailbox
D. dot, I. dot Y. dot
I get up on the stage and keep it thumpin'
Every second of my time slot
Back in high school
I used to keep my eyes locked
And focused on my notebook
Long verses, no hooks
I wasn't rappin' cuz I loved it
But I was so bored during classes
I said "Fuck it!"
And did it just to occupy the time
Lunchroom battles, I would drop the livest line
And slaughter 99
Percent of any rappers in the school district
This is a fact
Before I EVER heard Eminem rap
I was makin'  4-track tapes
With rebellin' approach
Then I'd go around school tellin' everyone they're dope and to buy 'em
5 bucks a pop, see you later
Sold a hundred copies and I bought a five thousand dollar blazer

I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
It makes me turn blue
Then when they taste every drop I bleed
In the eyes of the souls I feed
So bring it back, come on

I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
It make me turn blue
Without a push, I'll be diggin' in your mind
Come get youself a taste of my ignorant design, yeah

(Hello Kansas City) (whaddup)
And everyone else in America (Welcome to Love Potion 5, fool!) (This iiiiiiiiiiiis)(two sides, two EPs) (5!) COME ON!

[Verse 2]
Why is everyone obsessed with the 80s
Retro act of rappers dressed like the ladies
In hot pink jumpsuits, rappin' real soft
Like they want a little COCKMEAT lunch, too  1, 2
Everybody asks what I think about Asher Roth
I tell 'em, "I don't think about Asher Roth"
I gotta pedal my foot
I gotta grind 24/7 till my friggin credit is good
And I just paid my bill to Wachovia Bank
I bought a washcloth, scrubbed out the mold from the sink
I'd like to thank every Black Clover fan
I'd like to thank myself
Cuz I'm the man and I can't even get a tan
I'm too pasty!
Criminally slept on like friggin' Cowell Bastien
None of yall can ever outspace me
I'll squash you all into pencil-dick midgets
And give a little praise to the triple six digits
Dig it, zig it, zag it, zig-zaggler
Jagged little pill
Batter rhythm, caterpillar hill
Tryna cataclysm up
Bitch, I'll roll up on your crew
In a caterpillar truck
This gat'll peel a puck-
Sized round up in your crown
And you'll be found upside down in my town
K. dot, C.dot, Bitch Ass! (Bitches!!!)
I'm buzzin' like a victor
Jason Jeremy Laslow on SlimFast, come on!

I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
It makes me turn blue
Then when they taste every drop I bleed
In the eyes of the souls I feed
So bring it back, come on

I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
It make me turn blue
Without a push, I'll be diggin' in your mind
Come get youself a taste of my ignorant design, yeah

I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
It makes me turn blue
Then when they taste every drop I bleed
In the eyes of the souls I feed
So bring it back, come on

I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
I'm sick and tired of always lookin' at you
It make me turn blue
Without a push, I'll be diggin' in your mind
Come get youself a taste of my ignorant design, yeah
