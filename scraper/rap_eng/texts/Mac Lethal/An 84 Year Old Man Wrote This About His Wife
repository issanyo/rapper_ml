[Verse 1]
This is a story about my wife
My sweet wife, her name is Grace
I met her in 1953
She had freckles on her face
A poodle skirt: it was navy blue
Saddle shoes: they were black and white
I said my name is A.J
I’d like to take you out tonight
She said you’re very handsome sir
With your outfit, I’m impressed
But a lady ain't a lady if she so easily says "yes"
I may change my mind one day
And let you take me on a date
I said your beauty is so boundless
You’re so perfect — I would wait
Until the very last day of my life
I swear it’s true
I’d die happy knowing I spent at least
One day with you
Did she finally agree to see me?
Why yes she did
We were married a year later, we had 2 great kids
We were married a year later, we were unified as one
We had a daughter named Nicole
We had Anthony - he’s our son
We bought a tiny house with a yard
It had a dog - his name was Moon
I used to watch Grace
Garden every Sunday afternoon
I used to watch the Sundance
Off of her golden skin
Her curly locks of her
Bounced in the calm wind
She used to hold my hands
As our fingers intertwined
She’d say:

[Hook]
All I really want to do is kiss you one more time
All I really want to do is kiss you one more time
All I really want to do is kiss you one more time
She’d say:
All I really want to do is kiss you one more time
Then I'd lock my lips with hers
And we would go somewhere divine

[Verse 2]
We were married 10 years
We were married 20 years
We were married 30 years
Every day our love grew more
We were married 40 years
We were married 50 years
We were married 60 years
Then we were married 64
I use to hold her as we danced inside our kitchen
My life felt complete, not a single piece was missing
I fell in love so many times throughout my life
But every single time was with the same woman, and she’s my wife
Growing old with someone hurts
It's a process full of pain
Sometimes the sunny days
Are full of black clouds and rain
You need to have kids and grand kids
It’s the truth
So as you approach your final days
You can still enjoy your youth

[Verse 3]
My sweet wife her name was Grace
She started walking with a cane
In her smile, I could see love
But in her eyes, I could see the pain
I can’t forget the day she told me he could really see the end
I told her underneath it all she’s always been my greatest friend
Every single night before we’d go to sleep and close our eyes
She’d look at me, she wouldn’t say goodnight she’d say goodbye
I remember the last night she went to sleep and closed her eyes
We held each other one final time and said goodbye
And then she died
I locked my lips with hers and we went somewhere divine
All your friends and family were at the funeral in tears
Even Anthony came
You hadn’t spoken to him in years
My sweet wife her name was Grace
How I miss you, oh so much
I still possess your memories, but I sure miss your touch
I still possess your memories, but I sure miss your touch
I know your soul was not inside the ashes or the dust

[Hook]
All I want to do is kiss you one more time
All I really want to do is kiss you one more time
All I really want to do is kiss you one more time
I can’t wait to see you in heaven, baby, it’ll be so divine
Love A.J
