[Verse one - Brains McLoud]
When I’m In it - hit it - split it - GO –
When i hit i’m Riddick Bo
Killing everything in the perimeter
Giving your women an enema
Then I'm-a drink it slow
Irri-sist-able
Hit'em with a little bit of rhythm when I'm up in the middle
Admit it I'm venomous menace
Your mother's a witness and your little sister knows
Hell of a guy though
A regular Jekyll and Hyde with A Venomous side so
Demented & psycho
Got fingers in so many pies like a gyno'
Irrelevant rivals know there’s no ‘fucking around’
Like a celibate dyke so
Beginning to think I'm a little bit wicked
And sicker than killers in Bibles
I hit'em and hit'em and hit'em  until they're spinning
From everything I throw
My pen will kill everyone and then I guess you could say that its ‘Penocidal’
The legends that I know
Say I'm one of the best to develop a rhyme flow
A clever disciple of Eminem and I'm comin' for everyone's title
I'm Lucifer's product, cool and neurotic
And I'm fluid with topics
Sicker than dudes with bubonic, flu when they vomit
All you doing is gossip
Like the rumor my cock gets
Too big to be fitting in rooms full of hot chicks
Get loony psychotic choppin'
Ya' dicks into soup to consume when you want it
Yep, this dude is demonic
Truly more super than dudes in the comics
Do what I want, when i want, anytime I'm in the mood to be brutally honest
I'm keeping it ill though
The skill that I'm bringing ain't bringing a mill' so (I’ll)
Be up in these women giving'em feeling's making those milfs go (ow)
Cos pulling me in slow’s like using dynamite as a dildo
(How’s)
He in a minute I'm winning I'm finished I'm in and I'm out
With a little bit of boom bap
And a bit of Wu Tang Move back when I do that thing
Better get a flu jab every time I do rap
Everybody thinking 'Ooh that's too damn sick'
Bringin' rude rap in
Give me two fat twins
And dude I'm-a bet I'll do a bad thing
I been doing that since hearing 2Pac
Doing 'Trapped', Then I knew I could do that shit
Everybody thinking you mad
You wack, you can't do that
Have a look at your damn skin
Now I do rap
People thinking who that kid
He been through that ring
He's the new Jack King
And I proved that with a few fast hits
Of a huge ass spliff
I'm the new Manson
Ripping douche bags into half
With huge hands
Like I'm the new damn Hugh Jackman

[Hook]
Blaow
We spit so quick you thin that we from outer space
Mac Lethal, OBV, Big G on the Bass
We spitting supersonic honestly, why you late

[Verse 2 - Big G]
Came here for my respect that I expect to be leaving with
Move Like a breeze been observing MC's
With the heat on my best kept secret tip
Knee deep in this bitch on beat
Till the beats that I rap till the rest believe it
Kids step and get in check
While impress with this next achievement
See farmers in tract-ors
I'm-a put my city on the map though
These motherfuckers been spittin' like they want competition
I'm-a give'm what they ask for
In fact that is why I came back bro
I can stun from the front to the back row
Master the craft
These other cats yappin'
About gettin' ass so they (packin dope?)
Put truth upon it
Flew like a doomsday comet and (it real with supersonic?)
Do what I say and I play by a new set of rules
That are oozin' the juice of content
This, that and a third tap
And a nerd back with the word massacre
Mad Max on set dressed in his hazmat suit
Is too fast for ya'
Try keepin' pace
Claimin' the booth like a future great
Ease away as I seize the day
As I sat up to eat anything that play
Demons at bay with pens and paper
And the pent up anger that seems to fade
I've made a name for myself bodying tracks
That's all I need to say

[Bridge]
One;
I come to spit some killer flows
Two;
You got to know what I flow with
Three;
There is a speed you will not believe
It's four, watch the killer punch-line develop

[Hook - Brains McLoud]
We spit so quick you thin that we from outer space
Mac Lethal, OBV, Big G on the Bass
We spitting supersonic honestly, why you late

[Verse 3 - Mac Lethal]
It's a rap game massacre
I'm here, motherfuckers rap on the track so wack
I heard some
I hijacked a plane you're a passanger
I have to crash into a building so fasten your seatbelt
Cuz' a supersonic speed is a deathwish
Serve a little bit of venom and cinnamon for your breakfast
Give it to the rhythm
I take it you can bet this
Connor McGregor hit'em and sticke'em with the left fist
Bang!
The cypher is out
When I bust these raps with campfire slang
I'm Dracula, I got pale ass skin
And I'm sucking out your blood with my vampire fangs
You can buy cars, clothes, yachts, hoes
And other stupid shit
But you can't buy fame and you can't buy respect
Motherfucker got my hands on your neck
So you choke, like a cut throat
With this sick ass verse
Of course I emerge through gunsmoke
Rip, Rip I'm busting flow
I got a real big dick like a buffalo
And I'm-a fuck your throat with the mic-stand
And gimme the beat, you know I'm cutting down your life span
I got my finger on the trigger of my AK-47
I be boppin', I be cuttin' with a knife and
Just because you ain't notice me
You know its black liver records and OBV
I'm gonna lay in the cut while I smoke the tree
I'm gettin' crazy as fuck like I'm O.D.B
Shimmy shimmy yah, grip'em with the claw
Give it to the people
Get a rhythm with the raw
I'm supersonic
I spew with toxic
I'm like Tutan Kahmun
Gold pyramids
People that's young and old hearin' this
You want a raw flow, here it is
It's sick, it's great
It's raw, it's so serious
I, open your body like a butterfly knife
I turn you to steak
You gettin' butterflied twice
Shit
You thinkin' that Mac's done?
Nope
Leave the end red like a cap gun
From the front to the back
From the trunk to the track
Everybody better motherfucking back up
Watch them bodies stack up
I will prevail
I think faster than a dolphin
I'm thirsty for blood like killer whales
