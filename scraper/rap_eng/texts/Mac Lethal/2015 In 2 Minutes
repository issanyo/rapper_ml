[Intro]
Woot!
I just wrote this one

[Verse]
Were saying goodbye to 2015
We won't miss you, you ugly bitch
Yo, What a crazy year
Lemme say this clear
Lotta good things happened that will make you cheer
A lot of bad things happened that were way severe
Let's pop a bottle of the champagne and say some cheers
It's December and it's warm outside
I dont wanna have a debate but man it's making me hot
Im gonna tell you all about the highlights of the year, all the biggest news stories in case you forgot
Down in Charleston
South Carolina was a shooting at a church, 9 people dead 1 hurt
And South Carolina made everyone mad so they were forced to remove the confederate flag from the capitol building
Cecil the lion was living in Africa chillin until Walter Palmer an asshole a villian just illegally tracked him and killed him and murdered him
Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn and she blurred the lines between her and him
I swear to god the second that I thought i'd seen it all there was an earthquake killing twenty thousand people in Nepal and the hatred was awful
Every other conversation that I read up on facebook was hostile
So relax it's just facts
Mark Zuckerburg had a daughter named Max
A lot of black kids killed by cops and a lot of chinese stacks got killed by stocks
If you listen to radio this year it was apparent lotta brand new rap not real it's pop
But the Women's world cup was great
It was a beautiful achievement for our mothers and our daughters and we finally got some images of pluto from a satellite and went to mars and OMG we found water!
What?
Yes it's true
Im gonna move there away from you
Mayweather fought Pac Man
On Pay per view (On Pay Too Much Damn Money)
Ronda Rousey got her title belt taken too
The World Series Champions were baby blue and the Super Bowl was won by the Patriots too
Connor McGreggor
Golden State
Lamar Odom was found in a coma state and it was awful damn
RIP to Freddie Grey Sandra Bland
Rowdy Roddy Piper Yogi Berra Wes Craven thank you for giving me joy
Also i gotta send an RIP to Leonard Nimoy
This was the year of the American Sniper
Shootings in public an American crisis
Innocent Civilians out in Paris were lifeless
Charlie Hebdo shot by the terrorists ISIS
Shootings out in San Bernardino
Shootings at the planned parenthood in Colorado Springs
Now in every single state across America it's legal to get married even Kim Davis can't intervene
There was a European Migrant crisis with the Syrian refugees but in America the only thing we care about is hitting the quan eating bacon eating pizza with extra cheese

[Outro]
STAR WARS, I LOVE STAR WARS
Man, I bet ISIS is jealous because they can't watch STAR WARS x3
They're gonna be really jealous when we get our self driving cars next year
Happy new year biatch!
