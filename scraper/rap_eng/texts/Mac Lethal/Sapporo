[Intro]:
What up, what up

[Hook]:
Burn it down
Down, burn it all down
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I got the volume up when I burn it all down
Burn it all down
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I got the volume up when I burn it all down
Burn it all down
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I got the volume up when I burn it down

(Seven on the beat)

[Verse 1]:
Four arms, grip this bottle of Sapporo
Four arms, rip your body like I'm Goro
I'm a poisonous Black Widow spider
With eight legs
Plus I got nine heads like Hydra
In fact
I'm into swallowing blood
I got your wifey just falling love
The name is Mac
No, bitch, I'm not some doctor
I'm performing operations with my shotgun chopper like kapow!
Gettin' so hostile
Let's begin
You open your twat mouth to talk loud
I reach in
You're thinking I took you to a chop house
When these men sock down your weak grin
And knock out your teeth, friend
But the end ain't coming 'til the fat lady bitches really loud
And she's quiet cause my dick is in her mouth
It's like a buck knife to the throat
But one cut might push your dumbstruck life to the quotes
On the tombstone, inscribed:
“Mac's tone and vibe inflicted homicide.”
Dimwit dipshits, don't you know it's only pride?
Push your ego aside, damn, little homie, hide
It's like your drunk wife doing dope
Or some punk guy using soap to cut white screwing hopes
You'd better save her, hoping maybe you and her elope
She tied you down, but when she saw me, she just threw the rope

[Hook]

[Verse 2]:
I'm sicker than the AIDS that exist
Turn your stethoscope
Got that Ezio blade on my fist
These idiots still sign with L.A. Reid?
Goddamn, doesn't anyone in L.A. read?
Momma told me don't stop fighting 'til they bleed
I'm like ??? with that L.A. Greed
The zany shit, I'm kicking that forever
Rappers are in danger, I got game and fifty
Getting back together
I'm a damn assassin
Animus builder
Got a bottle of Sapporo and a can of dot pills
I'm a fucking wooly mammoth with my hands made of silver
Front kick to your face like I'm Anderson Silva, blaow
Drop the mic, grab a steel knife and threw it
I don't battle in my music, bitch
In real life, I do it
I've literally ended some careers, you can YouTube it
If you keep opening your mouth then I'mma Shoe Goo it

[Hook]
