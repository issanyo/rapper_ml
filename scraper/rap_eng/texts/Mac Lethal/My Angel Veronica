This is not going to be easily understood
You have to pay very very close attention to the story, and hopefully you'll be able to get the meaning out of it that I put into it but if not I'm sorry

Veronica Chappelle was a Kansas city chick
That liked to talk with conviction and slams of wittiness
She liked to
Feel my hands and make sure I paid attention
Always interested in what I had to say
She'd listen
Her father treated her like she was just a slave in prison
She loved him very much and wouldn't dare to raise against him
I wanted her to let me pay a visit to him
Cause shed come to my house enraged and licked with bruises
Wouldn't let me though, he was abusive in her young days
She used to freeze my soul and break it with this one phrase
One day were gonna meet at the beach and thats the end
This phrase is something I could never truly comprehend
And didn't try
Didn't have a lot of friends
Just different guys
That like to get her high then strip her fly physique and lick her thighs
We met in 8th grade and clicked ever since
Her bus stop was last so I never seen her house and never went
A lot of guys tried to fuck and most of them did
But I never asked for more than a friend
My boys was like she's just a dumb slut with bare legs that wears red and talks like a fucking airhead
But she was brilliant though they just didn't know that
She never had a clever reply to throw back
She'd just seduce them calmly with her beauty always potent
Go to the bar and find a new guy to walk back home with
I'd give her a disappointed gaze
But shed creep into my spinal column with her little phrase
Which had me steadily in love but she was heavy into drugs
She'd get high and tell bout the heaven up above
Like she knew, which made her soul so magnificent
On psychedelics or a dosage of lithium
Blotter postage, and ferocious barbiturates
No dope focus and some horse pills of mini thins
Lysergic acid had her trembling
French kissing off a double stack with a heart indented in
She used to watch my back she used to say
Backstabbers are frail so dogs are smart when they chase their tail
She kept me amazed
She kept my soul and made my life with her phrase
3:08 am I get a call on my phone
Somethings wrong, I can tell by Jojo's tone
He said Veronica was hit my a train
She committed suicide
I told you that that bitch insane
I hung up the phone with a rush of tears in my eyes
Bloodstream cool
But I was really not surprised
I must have lied in bed for hours, maybe even days
Thinking bout she probably used to play me with that phrase
And talked about she was a mermaid with a great soul
Like she was an angel
Like shed grab my life and take control
I'd see her at the beach and it would.....
It would be good

As long as the soul is good
As long as the soul is great
Life is great as well
An angel will save me
She's my angel
Tap me on my shoulder
But when I open my eyes
No one is there
Its her
