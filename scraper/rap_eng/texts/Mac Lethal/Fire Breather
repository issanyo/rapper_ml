{​Intro}​
1 2 3 4!
WHOO, You are a gorgeous man, Mac
Yeah, uh!

[Verse: 1]
Yo, my name is Lethal, if you not familiar
Big ball sack like a silverback gorilla
Red leather jacket like it's Michael Jackson "Thriller"
On the first 48 I was an instrumental killer, yea
I heard you actin' lazy, I'm bout to get you motivated
With my rappin', baby
You only get one chance to live, so do it passionately
See, you can get a little money and a black Mercedes
I'm so excited, I can smack a baby
Metallica, Slayer and Pantera, it's time to bring the goddamn terror
In your business meeting, tell 'em you're the boss
Get paid, straight cash, homie, Randy Moss

(Hook)
Cuz you're in last place, but you should be first
But you act like hard work makes your pussy hurt
You gotta take those bad feelings and you gotta toss 'em
Don't be a little bitch, just be a lotta awesome
Just be a, a fire breather, never be a quitter
Motivate yourself to try to work hard and get bigger
Be a flame thrower, big flame spitter
Run up on your enemies, your finger on the trigger

[Verse: 2]
You need that motivation, that shit is missing
Kid you ain't motivated, feel like you slippin'
But fuck it, go get naked, walk into the kitchen
Find an electrical socket, homie, and stick your dick in
Get excited, so fuckin' pumped, wow, say "it's my big dick, I wanna fuck now!"
Fuck yo enemies,they ain't as bad as you
PMA, Pussy Massacring Attitude
Do some push-ups, do a couple hunnid
Pick a fuckin' labradoodle puppy up and pun it
Do a shot of whiskey, make a blackin' tan
Walk in bank of America, with your gat in hand
Bang! Now listen, lady, you run a fuckin' cupcake business
I ain't tryna grind y'all out
But you got anotha bitch that runs a cupcake business
As competition? Cut her fuckin' eyeballs out

(Hook)
