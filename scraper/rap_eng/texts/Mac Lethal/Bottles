[Sample]
"Don't play with me cause you're playing with fire"

[Intro]
Talk to me Judas. Talk to me Judas. Talk to me Judas

[Verse One: Mac Lethal]
I should've listened to the gall and the opinions of y'all
Cause listen, y'all is just a bunch of bricks in the wall
Holding up my imaginary palace
A pinch of salt to the open cuts and I'm deficient with flaws
I'm like a winter time grizzly bear
Itchin' for a fish or a puppy makin' prints with his paw
Or a hungry baby kitten with claws
Scratching up the couch wishin' you'd call
Stacking up the clouds in a sense just to
Climb myself to Abraham's bosom
I blossom like a fire colored rose from the grey but it's crooked
I came and I took it away from the wooden faces to paint it I shouldn't
I should've shaken seven shades of Heaven's grays
Before they replicate the Section 8's in twos
Giving money to collection plates, confused
And then I...and I realize it tastes like tangerine skin
Hands on the clock couldn't hammer me in
Pick a side, suicide, homicide
Punch deep through your dragon shield
Fornicate with your fate and we split a wagon wheel
So listen to the rhythm when the trouble comes
Slither like a minister, imprison the cumbersome
I know that's simply condescending
I'm Prozack sniffling, gender and genre bending

[Hook: Mac Lethal] {x2}
And that's how the bullshit burns
Sittin' on the corner and I feel like I'm nothing but a germ
I gotta get a bottle of the fire my friend
I gotta bet a bottle of the fire my friend
