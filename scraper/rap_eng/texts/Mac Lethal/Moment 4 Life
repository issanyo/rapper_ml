[Intro: Mac Lethal]
Mac Lethal
And Irv Da Phenom

[Verse 1: Mac Lethal]
My daddy used to do a little heroin
Right into his arm
Thunder clouds barrel in
That's the reason life turned perilous
Since I'm white think I need to work for Merrill Lynch
Clap slow
Sittin' in an '87 Astro
Eight pounds of weed gonna make a little cashflow
Supposed to meet a lady with an afro
Wait a second baby there's the bacon smelling asshole
Fuck
Turned the car around cops coming
The speakers loud had the whole entire block humming
The cops blue like their little balls are not cumming
Luckily they didn't start something
Still left my heart pumping
Had to make a quick life change
Discipline and motivation in my veins
I know the shit's like Strange
But I turned the microphone on so I can piss my flames
Started digging and killin' it on some other shit
Pillow shaped women are chillin' up on my mothership
It's so fulfilling wait
I can feel the hate
Get up in a villain's face
Make him feel the bass
When I peel his face turn it to skillet cause I ain't done with it
This is great, the gorilla's in the fucking mist
Nobody ill enough to fuck with this
Me and Irv
See a blur sixty-eight cylinders rev 'em up and split
We the Kansas City princes
This is our life take your fancy little glimpses bitches
I'm gonna take a bottle to a groupie's neck
Man I'm fucking up Gonzalez just for suing Tech

[Verse 2: Irv Da Phenom]
If the lord above came today to take me away
I can't front I'd be a little afraid
Cause I don't know where I'm going, nobody does
It's really more or less hopin' that when you get there they open the gates and tell you that you can stay
And everyday I'm living, here's another test of my faith
I'm pretty sure I've flunked them all but thanks to God and his grace
I'm still here to try again and I find that amazing
Cause I know if i was him, I would've been done erase me
So while I'm here, and I got this time
I'm just try'na change some lives while I work on mine
Cause ain't no tellin' when he finna pull the plug
What if Jesus come back when I'm wasted in the club
Standin' on the couch in VIP when I'm disrupted by the biggest light I've ever seen and light from up above
Hope he don't hold it against me if I be like "What the fuck"
When the floor start to tremble and the ceiling open up
I see angels flyin' off with a few people but it doesn't look like they'll be coming back
Ay yo who just turned the heat up?
Can't believe this right here
I know that it's a nightmare but it seems I'm having trouble with the part where you wake up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Irv Da Phenom]
You gotta practice what you preach
I'm a firm believer of it
That's why today's sermon is titled Keep it One Hunnit
Open up the hustlin' bible and turn to the book of money
Chapter number four, I believe it is verse twenty
It reads "Thou shall not be fake fraud or funny"
That's why real still be all that you gettin' from me
Cause life goes fast, too short for me to live it fake and
You got a D-list cast in the script he makin'
I'm with an all-star team in this life I'm livin
DMG we be hustlin' with every minute
Givin' [?] in the opposition we show 'em the ending
And it's only the beginning we in it to win it my nigga you dig it
My only mission's to leave my mark
And set that bar so high that the generation coming after mine resides in the stars
Understand, this life is ours
If you ain't goin' hard then don't go at all
You ain't livin on a hundred then what are you livin' for?
God'll bless me with another day, I'm just try'na use it to improve and do something great

[Hook]
