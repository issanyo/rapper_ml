[Talking before song: Mac Lethal]
Man I drove by chick-fil-a yesterday
There were a bunch of protesters singing the national anthem....
For the first time in my life
Kinda wished two dudes woulda jumped outta the bushes and touched dicks..

[Start of song: Mac Lethal]
I woke up in the morning and the sky was a little grey
There was 800 people outside of chick-fil-a
Protesting, god damn
Holding homophobic signs in thier hands

I was like "geez, ain't that a little much?"
All I really wanted a little lunch
But since they won't leave gay people alone
Here's a recipe for y'all to make easy at home;
Lets go!

Fist you got to get ingredients to use:
Boneless chicken breats, salt, pepper, peprika too
Vinegar, egg, and a dabble of milk, with the oil, and two types of flour
Baking soda, dry mustard, pickles, and malted milk powder

Icing sugar
Some honey butter and some pickle juice
8 fluffy wheat buns
Now we getting loose
Mac lethal, oh damn man, he spits the truth
Like sarah palin is a man with a missing tooth
Now
Pour a little whine from your bottle
Get a big ass knife to cut the chickens horizontal
Marinate them in a bowl of pickle juice for half an hour
This would be the perfect time to take a nap, or bath, or shower

Season 'em with pepper and salt
Massage the peprika into them for better results
You gotta get up, and get you a dish
Remember the egg and milk is mixed in the water with pickle baby give it a wisk
Grab another bowl to pour all the sick four, icing sugar, dry mustard, soda, and malted milk powder

Does it need a secret ingrediant?
Of course it does
One teaspoon of Rick Santorums blood

G-what cousin?
You be nut huggin'
You and your hetero buddies giving each other high fives
Mitt Romney turned Mormon to marry five guys
In a dutch oven, pour the peanut oil in to give it a nice fry

Heat it up to 325
But not a single bit more, you dont wanna burn it
Dip the chicken breast into the egg bowl
Then dip it in the powder bowl
Smother it, and cover it, and turn it

5 minutes later, take it out and dry it
Cut and toast a bun, put some pickles on it; try it
If you like chick-fil-a, good, it tastes just like it
If you hate chick-fil-a, better, you ain't gotta buy it; anymore
