[Verse]
Uh oh, sup bro?
Bet you've never seen a fucking rapper with a jump rope
I spit something to the rythm, it's great
So baby get up off the couch and let me get you in shape
Like fuck yeah, let's excercise
Gotta prove to the world you're the best alive
Drop some pounds and get extra fly
Till we make it look so damn sexy I
First, gotta do it like this
Feet together with the nice little jump
Stay light on your feet and move right to the beat
Just to strengthen your core, make it tight in your rop
Playing Xbox all day man what the hell is that
You gotta burn a couple calories of belly fat
Spend all day [?]
God damn that shit was sexy
My skin ain't brown, it's clear
But I'm sweet as fuck
Like Crystal Pepsi
Tell Rihanna she my side chick
I don't really wanna act rightous
But if you wanna see you a tie trick
You gotta move your feet just like, this
You go little boy, woo
I'm the motherfucking kick, fuck [?]
Oh my god It's Lethal bringing a dumping thunder
So I hit em with some double lungers

[Fast Verse]
I'm bout to show the world I got some motherfucking cards
You know I'm rappin when I'm hopping and I'm jumping like I'm Murray
Beast on the beat [?] bringing terror
When I'm rapping to the rythm and [?]
You know if anybody wanna try and battle me
I'll hit em with the rope
It's gonna be so battering you motherfucker
Woo, I'll show you what I'm talking about bitch
That's how we do it

[Outro]
All these girls just blow me kisses
I be like nah, go too vicious
