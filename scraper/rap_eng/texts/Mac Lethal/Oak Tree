(Verse 1)
Baby your patterns are unusual
You're naturally beautiful
I mean you're luscious, You're gentile
You're comfy and you tongue tie my words
You sun dry my nerves, love fight then pur
And your self assured that you don't need me
And you don't want to need me
So I'mma let you take me under sweetly, discreetly
Your ambrosia gives me sensations until it stings
So I jotted down a couple things
You're pretty like a Frida Kahlo painting
You're pretty like the winter when it's raining
Or a Clydesdale horse that's untamed
You're prettiest when lathered in sun flames
And every moment spent with you is fragile and unchained
You feel like a crevice full of passion
You smell like a hundred million vestiges of jasmine
I repaint the huge, a deep shade of blue
And loudly I whisper this, loudly I whisper this to you

(Bridge)
It's not about the way you look it's not about your face
It's all the way you think it's all about your grace
Your love is like power chase
You're like an oak tree growing in a flower vase
It's not about the way you look it's not about your face
It's all about the way you smell, it's all about your taste
It's all about how you're so beautifully bright
You're the most amazing girl I've ever met in my life
And I'm in love...

I ain't exactly been your prince charming
I know that but don't be scared to trust me little honey bee
I ain't exactly been your knight in shining armor either
But don't you be afraid to fall in love with me
I ain't exactly been your everything
Yeah yeah yeah, I know but you got the cutest little snore when you sleep
How am I going to sleep without that...? it's like a song...

(Verse 2)
You're pretty like a Wagner symphony
You're a Carmine sunset penetrating every honest inch of me
You're a vasson full of pomegranate juices
And every single thought of you diffuses my cotton candy hubris
You're not just pretty, you're unreal you're surreal
You make me unafraid to feel period
I swear your love is like an out of body experience
I don't care if you're ready for my heart or not so here it is

(Bridge)
It's not about the way you look, it's not about your face
It's all the way you think it's all about your grace
Your love is like power chase
You're like an oak tree growing in a flower vase
It's not about the way you look it's not about your face
It's all about the way you smell, it's all about your taste
It's all about how you're so beautifully bright
You're the most amazing girl I've ever met in my life
And I'm in love...
