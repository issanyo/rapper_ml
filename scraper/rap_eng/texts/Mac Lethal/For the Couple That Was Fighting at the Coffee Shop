[VERSE 1]
I wrote this in a coffee shop, next to a random couple, arguïng and fighting, relationship in trouble
I was eavesdropping, listening to 'em argue
He was empty of emotion, she had a heart full
I decided to be artful and write this, the girl had tears in her eyes, the guy was sitting like this
Both of them just thought that they were right, but each was wrong
I decided I would help 'em out and that they need a song
Written by an outsider with no dog in the fight
I objectively heard both sides, now I'm solving the fight
And just so I can make it crystal clear, this couple had no idea that I was sitting there
So listen here

[HOOK]
If you were the couple at the Filling Station Coffee Shop on Johnson Drive in Kansas, 11:00 am on March 20th
I'm sorry for the song I threw together
But I hope ya'all worked this shit out, 'cause ya'all too cute together

[VERSE 2]
Now, the girl, her name was Aspyn. I know that 'cause the guy kept saying it, angrily fold the passion
And his name, was either Brendan or Britton
I couldn't make it out from the table that I was sitting
He was saying; Aspyn, it has been months since we had sex
All you do is act sad, and act stressed
All you do is act depressed and act mopy
I sleep next to you every night, but feel lonely
Low-key, I think you hate me
If you ain't attracted to me, why the fuck did you ever choose to date me
When I try to kiss you, you just push me away
I used to have your heart, until you put it away
Damn, I didn't know you couldn't handle this involvement
Am I that disgusting to you, am I that repulsive?
All I want to do is kiss and touch, but you got cold on me, life is always tense it's rough

[VERSE 3]
And she said: "Wait wait wait, it's like you never listen once
We used to make love, now to you I'm just a fuck
I work all day, I get home, you don't say shit
You just play your stupid fucking Xbox in the basement
You never talk to me, never ask me how my day went
And then you expect me to be turned on and get naked?
What happened to the charming conversations that we used to have?
You used to smile at me, hold my hand, you used to grab me
Right when I would walk in the door, and tell me I was beautiful, now we don't talk anymore
I didn't know you couldn't handle this involvement
Am I that disgusting to you, am I that repulsive?

[HOOK]
If you were the couple at the Filling Station Coffee Shop on Johnson Drive in Kansas, 11:00 am on March 20th
I'm sorry for the song I threw together
But I hope ya'all worked this shit out, 'cause ya'all too cute together

[VERSE 4]
And honestly, I'm just being objective
Both of you suggested you were being neglected
But from an outsiders perspective, both of you should take the passion that you feel and, eh, redirect it

[VERSE 5]
Brendan, Britton, whichever one your name is
I hope that you can take advice given by a stranger
Your girl has needs that require understanding
She needs to truly feel that you're her man, and companion
Talk to her, and when she talks, listen
Fix shit around the house, pay attention
She needs to feel wanted way more than part of the time
A lot of time for women, foreplay starts in the mine

[VERSE 6]
And Aspyn, I hope you understand, at the end of the day, your boyfriend is not a boy, he's still the fucking man
Sex to him ain't a luxury, it's a need
A tension deep inside him that's rumbling must be freed
He's low on oxytocin, help him see inside the blame
Fuck, help him reïgnite the flame
I promise that that, unloving asshole will go away
And that warm loving soul you crave will return

[ENDING]
I hope you both have a wonderful day
