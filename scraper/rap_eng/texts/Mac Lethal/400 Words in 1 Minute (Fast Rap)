[Intro]
Oh shit, I got a new challenge! Somebody said: "Hey, Mac, can you rap three hundred words in one minute?" and I was like: "I can rap four hundred words in one minute", check it out! Yeah!

[Verse]
I got a brand new challenge, everybody told me
I should grab the microphone and cut it open with my talons
I take a sharpie tagging your medulla oblangatta
I was screwing with your mama, I'm asuming I'm your father
See a lot of people copying my videos and holding up a iPhone
When they rapping trying to do it like I do
I'm giving a middle finger to the universe, I’m sicker than fuck…
Quick when I bust, putting voodoo inside you
I gotta spit four hundred words in under a minute
Fuckin' exquisite when I am bustin' ridiculous type of raps, bro'
Walk across a tight rope forty thousand feet up in the sky
While smoking on a stogie in my slippers and bath robe
I'm bringing a little terror to your mental state
I hit you in your lungs until you start to hyperventilate
Cuz life is always better with a double IPA and
Mashed potatoes sitting right next to your steak up on your mother fucking dinner plate
For all the people arguing on social media
About the quickest rapper in the world, you better know it's me, my friend
I am puffin' on some Denver Colorado marijuana
You can say that I'm a hippy cuz I swear to God that trees are friends
You faker than the butt on Khloe K, you fucker go away
You're parked up in a fire zone, your truck is getting towed away
They gotta break the hydrant and exterminate the heat I'm spitting
Shout to Danny Grooves because he fuckin' made the beat I'm ripping
I'm José Altuve, I am fuckin' little when I am swinging my bat
At the middle, Mac is so mental rapping subliminal facts
And attacking with criminal acts in the back of a rental
Like I'm Patrick Bateman hackin' with an axe, I crack your temple
Grab the microphone and get to choppin'
Like a semi automatic weapon, poppin' it will damage your skull
And if I ever cannot pay my bills off rapping
I'll walk in the store and steal a bunch of shit like I'm LiAngelo Ball
God damn, man, people are quite dumb
Somebody give me one reason that Rice Gum
Is famous I made this poison drink it and die son
I'm God, Jesus is my son
Huh, Hallaluejah
I’ll take your little credit card and stab you right in the medulla
Cuz you ain't got a motherfuckin' soul, you a loser
I'm the greatest rap YouTuber, booya

[Outro]
Oh shit, one minute and three seconds! Well, guess what: that was four hundred and sixteen words! I think we did it, Carrot! Say: "Yes"... or don't
