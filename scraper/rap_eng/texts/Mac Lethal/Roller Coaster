Sorry if I'm brash a bit, sorry if I'm passionate
But do you really want to hear me rap about the cash I get?
Doing Molly, crashing whips, hanging out with trashy chicks
That walk around and flash their ass and tits like it's a fashion tip
Rappers used to hang out in the passion pit
Now they in the trap and shit
The talent pool is so dry it chapped my lips
Every time I hear a rapper spit about his gats and clips
The only thing I see
Is record label owners cracking whips

No one thinks I'm scary, I ain't gonna act hard
I ain't gonna brag about my jewelry or my black card
I ain't gonna waste all my money on a fast car
I'd rather build an awesome roller coaster in my back yard

This is life, I gotta live it up
Get it right, you bet I give a fuck
And if I get the feeling that I'm getting stuck
I'mma take the grass and peel it up

And I'm gonna build a roller coaster
Cause I haven't rode one in a while
I'm gonna build a roller coaster
Cause I need a good reason to smile

Yo, sorry if I'm brash again but I could give a fuck
If Kim Kardashian is smashing ten Africans or any other rapper friends
If she's getting fat again, how she keeps her lashes in
All the cash she spends or if she crashed her Benz
I don't give a fuck if she got plastic friends
I don't give a fuck if she
Created or violated a fashion trend
This is not an insult that I'm aiming at her
I ain't even angry at her, I ain't never met her
I don't think she matters
I just hate you backwards chickenheads spewing hatred at her
Then you and your baby daddy have a kid and name it after her
I swear to god that reading gossip magazines
Is like breathing fumes of toxic gasoline
But I'm living the dream

See no one thinks I'm famous, man, I ain't a rap star
I ain't gonna brag about my jewelry or my black card
I ain't gonna waste all my money on a fast car
I'd rather build an awesome roller coaster in my back yard

This is life, I gotta live it up
Get it right, you bet I give a fuck
And if I get the feeling that I'm getting stuck
I'mma take the grass and peel it up

And I'm gonna build a roller coaster
Cause I haven't rode one in a while
I'm gonna build a roller coaster
Cause I need a good reason to smile

I'm gonna build a roller coaster, a real one
Not a wood, a steel one
I want to prove to y'all that life is still fun
Even if it's dark out, all of us can feel sun
All we gotta do is to remember to act like children
Close your eyes, have a dream
What would make you happy? You can say anything
Open up your eyes, does it feel like you're still dreaming?
Congratulations, you just found yourself a real meaning

OH! I gotta live up
Get it right, you bet I give a fuck
And if I get the feeling that I'm getting stuck
I'mma take the grass and peel it up

And I'm gonna build a roller coaster
Cause I haven't rode one in a while
I'm gonna build a roller coaster
Cause I need a good reason to smile
