[Verse 1]
It's friday night and all I wan't to do is relax
The week was so hard it almost made my knees crack
I'm trying to read on the couch in my sweats
Till my cellphone vibrates and I get a text it says
"What's up dude this is Chris come and meet us"
I said na man I'm just realizing with my feet up
He said "dude, it's Joe's birthday party, there's girl's here wetter than the mermaid Barbie"
I thought to myself "geez, hum, think, I guess it's not a crime to only have one drink"
Even though it's kinda risky I got dressed quickly, drove to the bar and ordered up a shot of whiskey
Then I got another shot of whiskey
Then I accidentally got like ten more shots of whiskey
Two martinis and a couple cold lagers, and finally a shot of goldschlager
How disgusting
Woke up the next morning on my carpet with a turkey sandwich smashed in my armpit
I swear to god I was this close to crying it hurt, I needed water I was dying of thirst
I fucking screamed

[Chorus]
I'm hungover, and I ain't gonna drink again
Until the night when I see my friends, until the night where we do it again

[Verse 2]
Popped two Advil, my head hurt like I got punched by the greatest boxing champion from [?]
I turned off my cellphone, turned on the TV like "ahhh i'm gonna take it easy"
For real though I'm staying in tonight, my brain is really sore, but all of the sudden I heard a banging on the door
It was my friend Matt, and he was with a couple cute bitches, and I was like "yes! I love cute bitches"
Come to the kitchen, lets have a couple light Buds next thing you know my freaking living room's a night club
Boulevard beers with some Xanax bars, we even shoveled snow with my Amex card
Woke up the next morning on my couch with the taste of Makers Mark in my mouth
I swear to god I was this close to crying it hurt, I needed water I was dying of thirst I fucking screamed

[Chorus]
I'm hungover, and I ain't gonna drink again
Until the night when I see my friends, until the night where we do it again
I'm hungover, and I ain't gonna drink again
Until the night when I see my friends, until the night where we do it again

[Verse 3]
Yo, I can't drink like I used to, either that or I don't choose too
But when I do dude I get so drunk that it looks like I'm talking to myself like a person with a Bluetooth
And I be slurping on that Deuce-Deuce, never Vodka and fruit juice, man none of that stuff
Just give me a tall boy of PBR I gave a whole can CPR like "breathe goddamnit!"
Check this, last week we partied so late that we went and got breakfast
Then I sent a text message to my ex-bitch telling her she looked like precious
Then I broke into her Netflix!

[Chorus]
I'm hungover, and I ain't gonna drink again
Until the night when I see my friends, until the night where we do it again
I'm hungover, and I ain't gonna drink again
Until the night when I see my friends, until the night where we do it again

[Outro]
Why does every sing weekend gotta end up like this? goddamnit!
I'm always like "I'm not gonna drink tonight, I'm gonna take it easy"
Next thing you know I'm at Denny's eating something greasy
Mac Lethal, Seven, we out
