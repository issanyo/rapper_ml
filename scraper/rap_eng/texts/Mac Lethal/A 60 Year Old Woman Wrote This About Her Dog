[Intro]
This is dedicated to Darcy

[Verse 1]
My name is Darcy and I’d like to tell my story
About my best friend who’s in another category, see
I was always happy, I took care of myself
I enjoyed life, I always stayed in good health
When I was 52, my telephone rang
My doctor told me the results from my biopsy came
He sounded so upset, hurt by his tone
He told me I had cancer in my bones
I was in shock; I was out of breath
Up until this moment I was never scared of death
But when you find out, you have cancer
It’s like the grim reaper rings your doorbell and waits for you to answer
When I was going through chemotherapy
My husband walked in with a gift just for me
It was a puppy, instantly I loved him
My sweetest baby boy
I named him Muffins

[Hook]
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
You’re my best friend

[Verse 2]
My medication used to keep me up at night
I felt so weak didn’t have the strength to fight
Muffins could feel it, he understood my plight
And he radiated energy that made me feel alright
At times, I swore death was coming soon, it’s what I feared
I’d snuggle Muffins and quietly let out my tears
I’d tell him you are such a precious little doggy
I felt him pull the sickness out of my body
He took away my pain
He took away my tears
I finally got the phone call after a couple years
My doctor said I have some great news
I’m about to wipe away your pain and your blues
I want you to sit down and listen
Darcy, our cancer has gone into remission
I cried tears of joy
I felt like I could live forever
I swear the love from my sweet puppy made me feel better

[Hook]
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
(You’re my best friend)

[Verse 3]
Not even 9 months later
Muffins started showing strange behaviour
He wouldn’t eat, he wouldn’t play, he wouldn’t move
This wasn’t my baby, he wasn’t in his best mood
His heart beat sounded frantic in his chest, so
We took him to the vet and ran some tests
The Vet didn’t call me back for 2 weeks
But when he called me I simply couldn’t speak
I remember when the telephone rang
I remember being crushed by the pain
He sounded so upset, so hurt by his tone
He told me that Muffins that his cancer in his bones
It shocked me, broke the heart inside my ribs
It’s the cancer left my body and entered his
Within a year, my baby boy was gone
I hope I can him alive forever with this song

[Hook]
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
You’re my best friend
You’re my best friend
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
From the beginning
I knew I’d love you until the end
(You’re my best friend)
