[Intro]
Okay, now i'm offended
Did you just say you can't sing along to triple F tits?
'cause that's bullshit. Check it out
Girls with triple F tits need love too
As long as they're real like the Moon Landing
And they are not fake like Kung fu
Joe, next time i'm in LA, you will have to let me come through
Come on baby, we gotta do another podcast together
The streets need this
(Triple F's!)

[Verse]
I'm flipping a fuckin' fast flow for Ari & Joe
My flow is freezing and it's frigid like it's forty below
Fatally fucking famous figures up like Fentanyl
In four doses
I finger fuck a French freak in my Ford Focus
In February, I fap to fitness females
Fuck foodstamps, you're fat from fixing free meals
Four thousand first place finishes in Fortnite
I finished Floyd in the first, I'm just being Forthright
FREAK PARTY Fool, Fly the flag with the fifty thieves
FFF flow
I hit harder than GGG
Fly to France and feast on fried flounder
In the forest with a florist named Florence
When I found the floozy floatin'
Her fanny fragrance was funky like a fish
Made her scream like Francis Ngannou fucked her with his fist
Flavor like fried fowl
Flossy/Foxy
Foster French fist fighters like Firas Zahabi
Fast like a Ferrari Fiorano, when i'm flicking the finger
Fornicating with a freedom fighter in the front seat
Freestyle flawless and festive flows
That feel fantastic like fellatio with no front teeth
I'm Futuristic when I forge a formidable
Fireball from the furious fission of Fukishima
You fool, this ain't even my final form
Fucker, my flow is a fusion of Goku and Vegeta
That's enough f-words, the song's 'hella tight
Saying Mac Lethal ain't strong on the mic
Is like saying Bryan Callen could blindfold himself
And fuck up Brendan Schaub in a fight, uh
Young Jamie is a desperado
"Look into it" like Eddie Bravo
My flow's in rehab
"Blue cheese with wings or go fuck your mother!"
Like Joey Diaz
Does Mac Lethal got a tight flow to get rich?
Would Jon Jones send a white girl a dick pic?
That's enough of the gold flow I drop fast
Peace to the Joe Rogan Podcast (bang!)

[Outro]
(Come on Joe, I'm coming back on the show man, I'm gonna perform this, I'm gonna do a bunch of fast raps on the show, I didn't perform last time. Everybody tag Joe, tell him i'm coming back, we're gonna talk about alien pussy!)
