[Hook - Sample]
I will sooth your pain
I will ease your strains
I got nuthin for you
Nu, nuthinn for you to gain

[Verse - 1]
Uh, uh, a black rainbow
Angel with a cracked halo
Ill make you mine but you ain't taking up my last name though
God damn, your smile is bloody, uh
I guess I’ll fuck you on a pile of money, uh
You got the swagger of a woman with a dagger
And a crooked demeanor
But nah, I ain't lookin for neither
But I just love to watch you scratch your nails on the hood of your beamer
When I open you and push in the ether

CHORUS:
*I will soothe your pain*
That’s what I say
*I will ease your strains*
But in real, but in real life
*I got nuthin for you* uh, uh
*Nu, nu, nuthin for you*
But in real, but in real life
*I got nuthin for you to gain*

[Verse - 2]
Black rainbow, funeral, eclipse
Black raincoat, beautiful, deep kiss
Taste like pussy
Digging your boyfriend a grave site secretly (secretly)
Watch the stage lights secretly
Leave with me
In the grey night creep with me
I must, have an affinity for sick disease
Cause this affair is fucking
(HIV to me)
Alcoholic red wine
Adderall at bedtime
Make it so I have to call you next time
I just don’t feel right every time I get you out your black gown
Your boyfriend is textin in the back ground
God damn, you got the swagger of a woman with a dagger
That just stood under a ladder
Holding 13 black cats
And took each one, threw it at a mirror till it shattered to the floor
My irises are blacker than before

Chorus:
*I will soothe your pain*
That’s what I say to her
*I will ease your strains, yea*
But in real, but in real life
*I got nuthin for you*
Uh, uh
*Nu, nu, nuthin for you*
But in real, but in real life
*I got nuthin for you to gain*
Nuthin at all…

[Verse - 3]
Yo, Black double rainbow
Oh god it’s luminescent
Are we being stupid?
That’s a stupid question
I ‘m just lookin at the diamond on your finger
Just remembering the fact that I ain’t buy it for you either
But in real life
You make me feel like a slut
So I'mma make you kneel like I’m tut
Bow to me
Like a God
Cause this dude loves you like the goddess that you aren’t and you're with me
You should be proud truly
Actin like it’s such a special occasion
Actin like it’s such a clever liaison
I think you got the devil emblazoned
Under the fabric of your negligée
The way you look at me
It’s like your practicing for wedding day
But in real life
He loves you
I don’t even fucking know you
Wait a second; I should say that to myself again
He loves her
But he don’t even know that you exist
So say goodbye
Blow her one more kiss
You wouldn’t give crack to a crack addict
So try to be a little pragmatic
You should go and find something true
Stop being taboo
Tell the dude the same exact thing too
Chorus:
*I will soothe your pain*
*I will ease your strains,* uh
But in real, but in real life
*I got nuthin for you*
But in real, but in real life
*Nu, nu, nuthin for you*
Uh,But in real, but in real life
*I got nuthin for you to gain*
Uh, But in real, but in real life
But in real ass life uh
