[Intro: Mac Lethal as Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah
Dear… dear, Slim
No
Dear… I wrote you, but you still… mhm
Dear, S– M&…

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Dear Eminem, it’s Kells
Enough is enough, now you’re hurting my feelings, homie
I thought that you promised that after we patty, you tell the world that you really love me
I’m sorry, I said that your beard is weird
Sorry, I went and called Diddy
But lately, it’s like you will not even snuggle me, hug me, or touch me, or kiss me

[Verse 2: Mac Lethal as Eminem]
I’m sorry, MGK, but lately you’ve kind of rude
And if I’m being honest, I just cannot date that kind of dude
You never take me roller skating, never buy me shoes
All you do was fuck me once, and take me out for Chinese food
And at the table you just stare down at your Samsung
I’m sorry that I made fun of your man bun, but damn, hun
You used to have me open like a Swiss army, now you just harm me
I hate the Rap Devil, where’s my prince charming?

[Verse 3: Mac Lethal as Machine Gun Kelly]
Oh, you wanna try to complain that I never wanna to take you on a date
Well, last time I tried that shit, homie, you was like 30 minutes late
And you were showing off your cleavage, flirting with the bartender
Plus, I went through your phone, why the fuck you installed Tinder
–Kells

[Verse 4: Mac Lethal as Eminem]
I read you like an almanac
And eat you like an almond snack
And fuck you at the Ramen sack until the condom crack
And I'ma cock the gat
And shoot a hole up in your stocking cap
‘Cause you were sucking Yelawolf’s cock in a back of a Pontiac

[Verse 5: Mac Lethal as Machine Gun Kelly]
I ain’t cheating with Yela, I’m just cheating with Diddy (bad boy)
And you can say shit about it, ‘cause you’ve been sleeping with 50
I thought we battle just for fun, just for therapy
Why you gotta make that Killshot song and embarrass me?
–Kells

[Verse 6: Mac Lethal as Eminem]
Oh, Jesus Christ, Kells, you started it
I never wanted part of it
Why is everything a fucking argument?
I don’t wanna argue now, but you never do the dishes
Never take the garbage out–

[Verse 7: Mac Lethal as Machine Gun Kelly]
Mid stop it, Marshall, wow
You really hurt my feelings, I cannot feel joy your smile
I used to be your fucking party kid, a boy that’s wild
But all you do these days is hang with your new Joyner pal
Plus Royce [?], I heard that he’s your boyfriend now

[Verse 8: Mac Lethal as Eminem]
Look, I probably shouldn’t say this, but it’s worth revealing
But when you said my beard was weird, it hurt my feelings

[Verse 9: Mac Lethal as Machine Gun Kelly]
Would like to apologize, Eminem, let’s talk about it

[Verse 10: Mac Lethal as Eminem]
Okay, let’s talk about it, by the way, I like your outfit
The leather pants really hug on to your thighs
That choke chain really brings out the color of your eyes
I hate it when we fight, Kells, I love that you’re my guy

[Outro: Mac Lethal as Machine Gun Kelly]
Let’s kiss and make up, Eminem, then go get some fries
–Kells
