[Verse: Mac Lethal]
I'm a freak to the bone
Twist off the lid make you drink my cologne
You've been warned, America has too
I'll turn your ass out worse than Erykah Badu
I'm bad news to prove you ain't a mack my brother
Your girl looks like the Souljah Slim album cover
Full of magic when I'm just attacking the cake hole
I got six harems in the Castle Of Grayskull
Cantankerous, mangling dangerous ways of just raping 'em
Digging the clitoris faithfully, any angle
Sticking em, strangle 'em the blue body
[?]
Give a Hot Carl, play bukake, graciously
I got rubbers but damn all those
I like the pussy pink like Cam'ron's clothes
Kansas City to the southern underground
I wipe the nut with a pregnant mother's bloody gown
