[Intro]
Morimoto, welcome

[Verse 1]
I drink my water in a wineglass
Wine in a brew mug
All the homies sitting on the porch like june bugs
Chilling, from the clump of thoughts in my sour brain
To the clump of my girlfriend's hair in the shower drain
Rain, rain, go away - sunshine show your face
Irish in my blood, never been but I know the taste
Baby I'm like outer space
I can't make a sound when there isn't any oxygen around
(Let me breathe, girl) Every queen twirls to the sound of her own name
Rappers push bullshit albums with no shame
I've been paying dues over ten long years
I think it's time I reverse suplex the whole game
God damn, the wrestling is fake
I'm a demon, I'm a rogue, I'm a devil, I'm a snake
I think I should admit that in my head is something great
I one-take a whole song, don't need to edit no mistakes
So I don't want to die, I want to be alive
I want to live until I'm like eighty- or ninety-five
With a tall glass of double IPA
And that ain't going to happen but fuck it, I'm ok

[Hook]
So put your hands in the air and make em wave y’all
With the single mother who taught you how to play baseball
Just do it, you gotta do your best
Man just do it, you gotta do your best
So put your hands in the air, y’all put em in the sky
If a single father said you’d better look him in the eye
Just do it, you gotta do your best
Man just do it, you gotta do your best
Life, you gotta do your best baby
Life you gotta do your best

[Verse 2]
I used to blow cocaine, used to take oxy
Now I put quiet espresso shots in my coffee
A lot of rich people feel crappy when they’re wealthy
It’s all about choices; you’re happy when you’re healthy
All the nerdy kids in high school that never mattered
Nowadays throw around the word swagger
You’re thirty-seven years old, acting like a teen
Let the younger generation have their own thing
Everyone twirls for their own little everything
I got a dirty martini, I’m sitting on the mezzanine
The worst people with the worst behaviour
Always walk around acting like a saviour
My prayer is
I don’t wanna die, I wanna be alive
I wanna live until I’m four-hundred-and-eighty-five
With the same friends and the same crew that I’ve got now
Still trying to make my mom proud

[Hook]
So put your hands in the air and make em wave y’all
With the single mother who taught you how to play baseball
Just do it, you gotta do your best
Man just do it, you gotta do your best
So put your hands in the air, y’all put em in the sky
If a single father said you’d better look him in the eye
Just do it, you gotta do your best
Man just do it, you gotta do your best
Life, you gotta do your best baby
Life you gotta do your best

[Verse 3]
I used to say yes to Robert Green
Go Neil Strauss
I used to follow a religion that had no real clouds
I used to drink Guinness every day acting like a beer snob
Until I had a Cascades Oatmeal Stout
I used to have a lot of friends that I’ve still got
I should probably take em out to lunch, it’s overdue
I used to have a lot of friends that I don’t got now
I’ve got a lot of new enemies and so do you
I used to loosen up my independent drugs with a state key
Every single movie store in town gave me late fees
I used to want to travel inside a portal
Now I hope to god I can live life immortal
Cause I don’t wanna die, I wanna be alive
I wanna live until I’m a million and sixty-five
Still drunk, fed up with the government
Thinking nineteen-eighty-four was truly on some other shit

[Hook]
So put your hands in the air and make em wave y’all
With the single mother who taught you how to play baseball
Just do it, you gotta do your best
Man just do it, you gotta do your best
So put your hands in the air, y’all put em in the sky
If a single father said you’d better look him in the eye
Just do it, you gotta do your best
Man just do it, you gotta do your best
Life, you gotta do your best baby
Life you gotta do your best
