[Intro]
Two Bottles Clacking. I made this on Halloween, used two beer bottles. I just wanted to say, when you got fans like Black Clover has fans, you don't need friends. That's a genuine statement from the heart, I love you guys. Let's go

[Hook]
I've lost some friends and some friends have lost me
But I'm not catching up with them over coffee
Because I don't like to break ice
And I don't like awkward silences
And I don't play nice
I've lost some friends and some friends have lost me
But I'm not catching up with them over hot tea
I got one bottle got two bottles not three
I just need my family (forever)

[Verse 1]
Your old fling got a new last name
But you don't got one are you that strange?
There's a big difference between settling down
And just settling for the only person thats around
Your so nervous that you drown trying to float
Hands too shaky, found by the boat
Your daddy always said gotta sink or swim
Little beautiful, and then with one blink it's him
At his funeral, you're sittin' there front row
I know, it happened to my mom five years ago
We talked every day, we were stayin' in touch
I didn't flake on her much
And one day she called to take me to lunch
To wish me luck
I was goin' on tour with my friend Sage Francis and shit
She couldn't stop telling me how proud that she was
Then she ordered us a piece key lime pie to split
Two months later I come home
She's sick with a lung disease thats unknown
Five months later she took her last breath
But we had some issues we didn't address
Still festering, oozing like an abscess
I'm thinking to myself "well I guess that's life"
But that's death
One day you're at lunch with your mom
And the next day you're carrying her casket

[Hook]
I've lost some friends and some friends have lost me
But I'm not catching up with them over coffee
Because I don't like to break ice
And I don't like awkward silences
And I don't play nice
I've lost some friends and some friends have lost me
But I'm not catching up with them over hot tea
I got one bottle got two bottles not three
I just need my family (forever)

[Verse 2]
I ride kick drums grind for my income
Didn't have a girlfriend so I had to get one
Got one, some friends said that she changed me
Why? cause I don't act all bitter and angry?
Lonely? y'all wanna act tough bite me
I get home cooked food and back rubs nightly
These are doors y'all secretly won't close
I find memories in the sepia photos
We took and developed as young free kids
But that is not something that I'm gon' relive
I'm grown, its over, I've become a man
It's not my fault you didn't find a fucking plan
And stick to it
Don't stress me out
I got bills to pay, I got a messy house
I got a fridge to fill, with key lime pie
We gonna have a son, you should see my life
(come on)

[Hook]
I've lost some friends and some friends have lost me
But I'm not catching up with them over coffee
Because I don't like to break ice
And I don't like awkward silences
And I don't play nice
I've lost some friends and some friends have lost me
But I'm not catching up with them over hot tea
I got one bottle got two bottles not three
I just need my family (forever)

[Verse 3]
Man you know who you are
Back in high school
When you would walk around the halls acting like a rock star
And all those kids you used to bully up on
Have good careers now and drive nice cars
And you, just sit up at the bar full of rage
Hitting on girls that are half your age
It's obvious to me you never passed the phase
Of confusing aggression with acting brave
You've been upstaged trying to changed your ways
Now you belittle my career trying to cut me down
You talk about your high school girl like she's still yours
Dude, she's married with a husband now
Our childhood friends never take your calls
You're rude, you're loud, you break our balls
You say that we all turned our backs on the crew
But the truth is, we turned our backs on you
Ain't nobody gonna hold your hand
There's only one set of footprints in the sand and they're yours
You can choose to walk or roll your pant legs up
Take off your shoes and socks
And stand with the cold water up to your ankles
All the tiny seashells seaweed tangles
Remember though, the tide is sinister at night
You might end up missing from my life
And that could be nice

[Hook]
I've lost some friends and friends have lost me
But I'm not catching up with them over coffee
Because I don't like to break ice
And I don't like awkward silences
And I don't play nice
I've lost some friends and some friends have lost me
But I'm not catching up with them over hot tea
I got one bottle not two bottles not five
Let's share a piece of key lime pie
Tonight

[Outro]
Two Bottles Clacking, by Mac Lethal. Happy Halloween. I hate when people say "tonight." Tonight is like the biggest cliche in a song. "Let's do this and this tonight. You could do this tonight, run this town tonight." Stop saying tonight in your songs
