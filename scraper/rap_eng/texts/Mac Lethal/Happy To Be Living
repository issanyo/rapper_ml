No lie... I woke up at 5:30 ion the morning on sunday with this new melody and song in my head
Thought of this shit in my sleep
BlackClover in the house, BlackClover in the h-h-h-house

Ay yo i'm livin, happy to be lucky
Inchin, closer to my goals theres better grub up in my kitchen baby listen, I'm lucky to be happy
Kissin, momma on her head and thankin daddy for his wisdom not to mention, I actually don't want these
Women, I love a women that can squeeze the sun like its a lemon so I'm twistin, bubblegum and passing
Sittin, on the porch with friends am I just happy I ain't kiddin man I'm livin, happy to be lucky
Fixin, all the broken parts and twistin screws that once were missin my condition, is wonderful and flashy
Gettin, money but to money I am actually indifferent so I'm living, happy to be lucky

Lucky that I realize life don't have to be so ugly so I'm livin, It could've been different
I coulda died yesterday but luckily I didn't guess I'm lucky that I'm livin, I'm happy that I'm lucky
Inchin, closer to my goals theres better grub up in my kitchen baby listen, I'm lucky to be happy
I'm just lucky to be happy and I happy to be livin, happy to be lucky
Inchin, closer to my goals theres better grub up in my kitchen baby listen, I'm lucky to be happy
I'm just lucky to be happy and I'm happy to be livin, happy to be lucky

Grippin, positive influence I dont listen if its temptin if they trippin, underneath the backseat
Clippin, why do rappers always put that bullshit in they writtin's cause their livin's, crappy and its ugly
Dissin, them is so beneath me let me focus pay attention I envision, the night is warm and in the
Distance, the stars are colored ivory the cresent moon is crimson this is livin, happy to be lucky
Fixin, all the broken parts a brand new starter and an engine my condition, is lucky and its happy
Gettin, up to watch my vixen make me breakfast in the kitchen I'm just livin, happy to be lucky

Lucky that I realize life don't have to be so ugly so I'm livin, It could've been different
I coulda died yesterday but luckily I didn't guess I'm lucky to be livin, happy to be lucky
Inchin, closer to my goals theres better grub up in my kitchen baby listen, I'm lucky to be happy
I'm just lucky to be happy and I happy to be livin, happy to be lucky
Inchin, closer to my goals theres better grub up in the kitchen baby listen, I'm lucky to be happy
I'm just lucky to be happy and I'm happy to be livin...
Baby I'm happy to be livin...
