[Intro: Mac Lethal]
You, sir, are an offense to good taste
An offense to good taste...

[Verse: Mac Lethal]
It's the mantra of another four-eyed monster
Put the layers of your soul in bow tie pasta
Enter the Contra code, lock and load
Travel down the rocky road, talk to toads
Frogs and crows, or any bird with the black wings
Off the wall like when a blind bat screams
Have dreams... record them, play them
These scenes? I don't care what order they in
Mayhem--everybody felt it, amen
Hot piece of youth like melted crayons
I'm gonna make a little bit of lava
Toured in your city, now you're living in a sauna
Speak that heat rap, re-track speech facts
Homie, when I eat that sweet fat beat...
Your knee caps crack. We gonna freeze the sea
B-lee, Noah23, and me... that's that

[Hook: Noah23]
Blee on the beat so you better believe that
Tricks up my sleeve so I'm wearing a pimp's hat
Keeping it sweet like your favorite tree sap
Footloose fancy free, knock your knee caps
X2

[Verse: Noah23]
Mackadocious like the black clover
Boy, thought I told ya: it's the ayatollahs
Of this rap shit, alien prowess spiraled
In a power of the flower soil
We taking you to church like a quatrefoil
Me and Mac Lethal spit raps that's royal
Back to Earth, yo, the road is rocky
It hurts so good when we go Fugazi
23 like Johnny, Con-Air on the plane, can't stop me
Anthony Kiedis belly flop up on the concrete
Hardly at odds with the gods, it's a suicide ride
But only at home if you do it right
You could [?] George Lucas
More useless, handsome, stupid hype
And who them groupies? Yeah, it's 23, baby
Put it down, B-Lee... call me crazy

[Hook]
