Go Royals. Rest in peace BB King. KC Kings

[Mac Lethal]

Check it out now
Here I come with the hype flow
Hear the drums and I might go
Bang!
I accelerate in centerfield when
I be running for the pop-up fly
You're thinking I'm like Lo Cain
Here's a preview
My name is Mr. Mac Maniac Lethal
I'm like Dyson when I'm dicin'
Or Walter White with a ciggy full of Ricin
That's what speed do
I'm gonna hit them with the EQ
I'm Mike Moustakas playing third base in my light blue dockers
Hitting to your opposite side so many times
They gotta find two doctors
Field of dreams, and I'm a white dude: Costner
This is Kansas City how we do it how we live it
Gonna rock it gonna battle gonna give it
Every single ounce of energy we got
We getting crazy getting loud
They're making Jordan's
But they gotta make some light blue Hosmers
We lead the pack, man in May weather
A way better fight than Pac-Man and Mayweather
We probably gonna bite them out of anger
We don't really care about Detroit, man
Tigers are endangered
Gordo got the platinum glove
Jump so high he could catch a dove
It's an act of love
Ryan and Hudler's back
You can't sneak a piece of cheese by a hungry rat
Morales up to bat the ball left the park
Hererra, Davis, Holland killing it no question mark
Gonna throw up an extra heart
Like I'm Alcides Escobar playing extra hard
Look, I don't smile when I pitch
I make the Yordano Ventura face
But you got them Kylie Jenner lips

Paulo triple-o he's making music with the bat
Like it's Apollo's piccolo
I hope you're following the flow
Cuz now we're winners
So I'll soak you like I'm Salvy with the gatorade
They think that' I'm a joker
But I'm actually the ace of spades
I'm picking up the bat and hitting homers out the stadium
The ball is flying by your head so fast it make your neck twist
Omar Infante and Alex Rios
And my main man Morales A.K.A. Cubano Breakfast
My head isn't bolted
I'm going lights out like I'm Edinson Volquez
In a Monarch's uniform
18th and Vine at the Negro League Museum
For Buck O'Neill we gotta rock hard and do it for him
Guthrie and Vargas are pitching the stones
Salvador Perez is sitting at home
And even though he's putting on perfume before he plays
It doesn't matter cuz we also got Christian Colon
610 - sports radio clicked in, gonna listen
To the drive and the country mart call in show
Man I'm tall with flows
Chris Young, boy 6'10
Say Denny Matthews never gives me bad news
Never thought a team could ever make the city that blue
With the best bullpen how can they survive?
We'll be champs until 2085 we live
