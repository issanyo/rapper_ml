Intro:
Ezekiel choke: Wrap you arm around the head, grab the sleeve of your gi, and crush his throat

Verse 1:
I'm feeling uninspired
Nah, fuck that shit
I'm feeling under fire
I'm 'bout to come alive
I'm 'bout to crush the vibe
I'm 'bout to take a hundred rappers hostage and
Choke out their oxygen
Won't leave a single one alive
Got my glass-dipped handwraps on
You little pussy got your Tampax on
Little bitch, got your new designer handbag on
I'm fuckin' poison
I swig the bottle and leave every drop of Anthrax gone
Gone with the wind until the harvest weather
I did these rappers so dirty I got a Scarlet Letter
I found a studio and crumbled up the opium tar
Plugged in the microphone, pressed record, and opened my scars

Chorus:
Now I'm sitting on the edge of the universe
Dangling my feet, you wanna jump, well I'mma do it first
This is life man, I let that go
I put my finger on the trigger and I check that pulse, woah!

Now I'm sitting on the edge of the universe
Dangling my feet, you wanna jump, well I'mma do it first
You better get that ghost
I never had a brush with death that close
'Cause me and death that close

Verse 2:
It's been a while since I felt sane
I spent a little too much time in hell's flames
I flatlined eventually
Woke up as a baby demon baptized in whiskey
My breath got that Irish car bomb stench
I love the pretty little scars on a far gone wench
You know I sleep on her spine like a hard long bench
And I eat Skittles while we play like I'm Marshawn Lynch
Lynch, lynch me with a comet tail
Walking through the snow leaving a whiskey-colored vomit trail
Locking up my soul and I'm like, "bitch, you know it's not for sale"
(Locking up my soul and I'm like, "bitch, you know it's not for sale")
A lot of bitter fans try to say I'm selling out
Okay, let's talk about the major labels that don't help me out
Let's talk about the number one singles and the ringtones that I've never had
Or the royalty checks I don't bring home
Listen closely, I'm independent homie
Which means that I can either shoot a video or get some groceries
You know, some lunch meat or pears at the store
You don't respect that? Then fuck you, I don't care anymore
Stop listening

Chorus:
Now I'm sitting on the edge of the universe
Dangling my feet, you wanna jump, well I'mma do it first
This is life man I let that go
I put my finger on the trigger and I check that pulse, woah!

Now I'm sitting on the edge of the universe
Dangling my feet, you wanna jump, well I'mma do it first
You better get that ghost
I never had a brush with death that close
'Cause me and death that close

Outro:
Ezekiel choke: Snugly wrap your arm around your opponent's neck. Grab the sleeve of your own gi. Do not stick your fingers inside it, however, because that is illegal
Now, pull the sleeve of your own gi, causing the outer ridge of your hand to wedge against your opponent's carotid artery
Posture up, pull down, and push your hand, sandwiching his neck
Train hard, shut the fuck up, and hit Ezekiel chokes
