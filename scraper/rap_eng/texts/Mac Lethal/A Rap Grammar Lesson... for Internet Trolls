[Intro]
Danny Grooves, drop the motherfucking beat

Probably shouldn't be doing this
But it's 2017, and on behalf of all literate people
We are sick of illiterate people giving us their fucking opinion
Okay?

[Verse 1]
First of all Geoff, I hope you burn up in hell
Here's a list of all the goddamn words you misspelled
In the message that you sent me, for better comprehension
I'm gonna break your message down, every single sentence

You said I suck at raping, you owe me an apology
I don't rape, Geoff, I rap, you forgot a 'P'
After 'I just want to let you know' put a comma
I may suck at raping but I'm good at fucking your momma

Man sharpen up your English when you write
You called me moth fucker, Geoff, think before you type
I don't fuck bugs
But I bet that you wish that Tom Brady would come and fuck you with the buttplugs

[Verse 2]
You disrespecting my dad and said I like the cheese
Well that's false too, let's discuss my salary
For me, rapper's the greatest career
I probably pay more in taxes than you make in a year

But that's not the focus, you can't form a sentence
With your idiotic, incorrect use of the ellipsis
An ellipsis is three dots, not two dots
A Greek term that signifies an unfinished thought
Which is all you've got

Idiots like you just tug away my heart
With your improper usage of these punctuation marks
Listen, if you want to write a paragraph or sentence
You need to understand prepositions and tenses

[Verse 3]
You shoulda said "If my daughter brought you home, I'd beat your
Fucking face in with my .45 Desert Eagle."
Instead you got the tense wrong and said Dessert Eagle
I love desserts, Geoff, that's not a way to hurt Lethal

You called me Dutch bag, shoulda called me douchebag
Your parents spelled your name wrong, that's fucking too bad
That's not Jeff, I think that says Geoff
Drop to your motherfucking knees and suck a G, off
G-E-O-F-F? What? Shoutout to the Jeffs with the J in the front
And the E in the middle two F's in the back
Go fuck yourself, my name is Mac, your shit is wack

Yeah
