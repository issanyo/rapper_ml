[Intro]
I guess as I get older, every winter seems to last a lot longer than the last one
But I'm not gonna talk, I'll just rap

[Verse 1: Mac Lethal]
Yes, Uh, Yeah, Uh
I feel the ebb and flow
I got a precious soul
I'm feeling normal if I've lost it you should let me know
From head to toe, covered in my past
I pour my anti-depressant into my wine glass
This is for certain
A bigger burden
Arguing with the mirror, I didn't get a word in
I know the cost, I know what's the strangest
Forever hoping that it does, but really nothing changes
There's such amazing art inside of everyone
But people go get jobs and forget to stay forever young
In the mirror see a person that's insane
All the pressure made me scream until I burst it in the flames
I'm entertained by scrutinising critics
And the darlings of the media still utilising gimmicks
Melt into a puddle of warm water and red wine
I have no blood left, I just bled mine

[Hook: Mac Lethal]
When the breath of life fills my entire lungs
It's not about me or the neighbourhood that I am from
I'm not afraid of dying, just afraid of dying young (x2)
When the breath of life fills my entire lungs
It's not about me or the neighbourhood that I am from
I'm not afraid of dying, just afraid of dying young
I'm not afraid of dying, just afraid of dying too young

[Verse 2: Mac Lethal]
Flying high, sink or swim
You think you're fat, you think you're thin
You're 19 now, perfectly built
But twenty years later you're a milf
Twenty more years you're a post-menopausal old woman
I hope you took the time to learn to make some awesome home cooking
Cause looks fade, even minds fade
I hope I don't forget the love and sacrifices I made
I'm just afraid of painfully dying
Tortured by the dark force, angels are crying
I guess I should repaint the horizons, open my mind
Stretch out the universe and soak it in wine
Laying in the fields where the opium shines
All I need is love, man, I don't need a dime
Cause I've been having dreams of my mother
I wake up crying, squeezing a pillow, thinking I hugged her
I loved her
I miss her
Hearts covered
In blisters
Super-conductor, transistor
An afternoon sipping on cups of tan liquor
Resting, lucid are the best dreams
Life can only move in one direction like a chess king
There's a devil on my shoulder and a devil on the other one too
But I told 'em both: Fuck it we're through
Uh

[Hook]

[Outro]
I know that the king on the chessboard can move in multiple directions, but I meant like one direction, one space at a time
You can't be self-destructive and building a good life for yourself at the same time
I'm not preaching though
North Korean Barbecue
North Korean Barbecute
North Korean Barbecuties, I see 'em, I see 'em
