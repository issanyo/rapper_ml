(Intro)
It's The Dana White of rap music
I'm balding
And I call people idiots
2 braiiiiinz

Idiots. there's lots of em
I wish that I could open up their brain and press the stop button
They're all dummies man the shit isn't cool
I swear to god, they're stupid as fuck and didn't listen in school
They're always so obnoxious
When they argue on the internet
But trying to debate with them is harmful like a cigarette
You try to outsmart these stupid jerks but you never win
Cuz lately their idiocy is worse than it's ever been
You better get your band-aids your bastard
My tongue is like a fan-blade but faster
I'm kickin a devilish man-made disaster
I piss on my fingers then givin you all a handshake after
For thinkin im just a pancake rapper
Nope, I kick through the door
Gay marriage gets my support
And I come smart when I argue over major issues like war
But all these stupid idiots keep misusing you're
Look. I dont wanna be a bitter, arrogant, american, elitist
But I think you better go and read a book
R I P to m c a I'm makin you all study english comprehension you ain't sleepin til we get to brook-lyn
Look friend, I could understand if you're just a kid
But if you're older than 13 years old you better see these words
And know exactly what the difference is
This one is a contraction, like you
Apostrophe, are, ready for action
You're at risk when the gem star slash your skin
You're an idiot like kim kardashian
This one's your. possessive. yours
Your beer, your gun, your mom's a whore
I Am taking it kinda easy on ya spittin a couple samples
Fuck it though im gonna give another example
Look see I dont give a damn about you insolent idiots
In a minute i'll administer venom; definitive wisdom
So take another glance and get a vision try to listen
Comprehend and you'll no longer be considered such a simpleton
But look. this one belongs to you
And this one is something that you are, it's true!
So there, fuck greed, fuck skinny bags of weed
And fuck you if you're a fan of either nickleback or creed!

Quit being such an IDIOT
All you gotta do is use some proper grammar its easy
Quit being such an imbecile
I hope to god your IQ is over 13

Cuz you were in the 8th grade once
And even then your teacher got mad when you'd get this wrong
Possessives and contractions are
Apparently just something that you USED TO KNOW
