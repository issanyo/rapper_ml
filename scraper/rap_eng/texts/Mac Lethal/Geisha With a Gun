I need to keep my eyes open
Xenophobic woven into opposes
Revealing my sociopathic soul that's folded to the selling
Holding a staff blasting open
An acid ocean
Is grabbing pulses
Explode a magical poltergeist
Appealing isn't it
I feel exquisite giving dumb shrugs
Cause the geisha got me bitten by venomous little love bugs
Whispered to keep my eyes open like an abscess
But lotuses concealed sitting underneath that black dress
Yes
She likes an irish shmuck
And likes to fuck
While she sits on top to ride her luck
But i need a mic to suck out the carnage
And some jack o'lanterns just to scare the bugs out my harvest
Grabbing a sharpie attacking an army of darkness
Marching bombarding hardly i'm charming and heartless
Carcass nitpicking, marker tit ripping
T'ill we watch me dig into her mind until i start to scrip it stupid
My whispers touch her lips and tickle her eyebrows
Whiskey licker t'ill the moon flickers and dies out
Exhale out my breathing tank wistfully
Belly flop onto the top of the sea of tranquility
From the hot claws
Ripping off the top bras
Tipping off
And sniffing all the moon tarts through shopped straws
Take a pause, i used to make collages
Out of fake mirages brainless broads
That would much rather take applause's
Breaking faucets
Feeling woozy and nauseous
Wishing i could fuck and knock the floozy unconscious
Loosing a lot of time frustrated in a zone to think
Doodle a lot of faces as i'm waiting for the phone to ring
I hope she brings a friend for the rebound
I feel the sober sting from the sinister street sound
Bloody kisses with a razor for a tung
Drunken vixen drugged and dripping geisha with a gun
It's begun
