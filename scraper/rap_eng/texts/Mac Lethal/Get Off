[Intro: Godemis]
Strange Music! Ho!
It's Godemis Ish in the place to be, but it ain't my motherfucking turn
Hey UBI, hit 'em in the neck with that shit!

[Verse 1: Ubiquitous]
One, two, play the beat, I moved up the ladder and I lay the heat
I do what I do every day of the week
And even improve in the booth where I’m paid to speak
Fuck you say to me?
When you play in the bench you can hate with ease
But I’m thinking that they like me, J Dupri
And I’m betting if I cut them they would bleed
It’s just too plain to see these, motherfucker bout two flames a week
They know nothing about this flame I speak
They run around bitching cause they can’t compete
So don’t ask me shit, he should know
I'mma tell him everything he need to know
You don’t need to know shit, you need to slow
Your motherfucking roll up and read the code
We the most slept on for tons of years
I ain’t talking about a couple of months you hear
And you’re acting like Ces has just appeared
Wanna run up and test my nuts in here
Go ahead, spread your shit
End in a place where the lead don’t fit
My man, I don’t play I end your shit
If the air don’t bake and the bread don’t sip
And I read your script, fuck your lines
Flesh don’t burn and sun don’t shine
Ces don't ride if the Tech don’t earn
Get up in the line, you can get your turn
I will X your eyes, sex your bird
You never gonna ride you don't let go first
Napalm deployed; on your momma boy
Little motherfucker looking like a mongoloid

[Hook: Ubiquitous & Godemis]
If the head don’t fit, get off my dick
Spread your shit, get off my dick
Spread your lips, get off my dick
Suck this dick, get off my dick
Spread your lips, get off my dick
If the head don’t fit, get off my dick
Spread your shit, get off my dick
Spread your lips, get off my dick

[Verse 2: Godemis]
Party’s packed, party’s packed
Let me get a part of that
Black clover up in this bitch
And no, he don’t know how to act
If she fronting, hold me tell her blow me and don’t call her back
Even if she’s on the floor having a fucking heart attack
Gangs on 10 here up in the club
We’re all in here up in the club
Came in the club with the bud and a buzz
Now want a shot and a little bit of what
I don’t know, I don’t know, falling like a domino
Budget ballin', parking lot pimpin' outside of the Conoco
We’re mixing two for the alchemy, now I'mma tell what it’s about to be
Like M-L-K I’m about to take one to the head on the balcony
And I know some fools got it out for me, though
I don’t wanna say I got them
I'mma kill them all and let Christ sort ‘em, that’s God’s problem
And I mean I'm out of orbit, they say that I’m so fly
Get a gig as a Chippendale, all I need is a bow tie
My temper telling me to attack ‘em, but clearly that would be the day
Eclipse 'em we’re on our grind otherwise known as that T-M-J

[Hook: Ubiquitous & Godemis]

[Verse 3: Mac Lethal]
Denied by the bank for a loan
Denied by the bank for a loan
Yup, so I got a shoe box full of cash
And I paid for the whole damn house on my own
Bitch, do you want a mouth full of stone?
Then keep trying Mac Leth. ain't hard
And I'mma shoot a little semen like I see a meteor
Reach for back for the black pre-paid card
And this and that Mega Mac pilfe bitch
How you’re number two, but you still ain’t shit
Better stall your cops, better call yours off
If your head don’t fit I'mma saw yours off
Now you can't hear your mix-tape getting killed
Playground days back in 6th grade drinking milk
To now where every single last one of
You motherfuckers are still lookin' hella' bitch made like a quilt
There’s a five hundred and fifty million dollar power ball jackpot
Going on literally as I record this and I would go and try
And buy the winning lottery ticket But Ces Cru called and said we gotta revisit
On that white Wu-Tang shit wallaby kick it
And just because the music is Strange don’t mean that it got to be wicked
Wiki-wiki Wikipedia Mac bitch, stroking on a media fat bitch
Smoking on pd with black lips, open all your media outlets
Watch me read the whole encyclopedia backwards
I’m the king, God dammit, and I’m alpha male
If you see a little rapper in the crowd that’s hating
Know that he rode on my dick so long that the GPS bitch said "recalculating"
