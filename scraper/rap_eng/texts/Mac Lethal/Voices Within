I didn’t bob, I didn’t weave, I didn’t run
Why get a job when in my sleeve there is crumb
There is a need for every crumb forever young
Forever in blue jeans
I blame my other half for the pressure and mood swings
But wait, not my lover, no no, I mean the other half of me
She hogs the covers, I puff it, pass then sleep
So if I die today the only thing that I would wish
Was that I had more time to sit around and not do shit
I got two fists, but no will to fight
So we can take it outside
And I’m gonna be like "damn, what a pretty night"
I got hindsight right here, that’s something that you’ll never get
It’s not an epithet, it’s real, I bubble but I never sweat
And if I melt from the heat stroke
I’m gonna float forever by myself in a steamboat sink
Before I reach the brink
The most self destructive thing I ever learned how to do was think

[Hook/Caleb Slade]
Now tell me where does this thing called me begin
Or better yet can you tell me where my madness ends
You think you can separate the man from the Voices Within
I think not, no I don’t think so, cause we have tried and me and these demons share one soul

The first time that I fell
I was bleeding inspiration on a beautiful trail
Too soon to inhale another turbulent turn
Learning how to readjust as my pseudonym burned
It’s an iron-man world, with a silent film etiquette
Fire man carry all my problems to the benefit
And at this gala event, there are no black ties
It’s full of crooks that live in castles and can cast fire
The sky isn’t quite right
I don’t want to fight like “This is it” bye, and it’s night-night
A person of trained thought, denying alarm clocks
Implying that my mind is just a haven for soft spots
My simple life won’t apply to you
It’s cut and dry, and confined by the right of truth
This carousel will work till it breaks down
And apparently the words are all just the same now

[Hook/Caleb Slade]
Now tell me where does this thing called me begin
Or better yet can you tell me where my madness ends
You think you can separate the man from the Voices Within
I think not, no I don’t think so, cause we have tried and me and these demons share one soul
