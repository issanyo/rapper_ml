[Hook (x2)]
I'm just tryna vent a little bit of hope, it's in jest
That every single second gets me closer to death
I'm trying to relax, I'm tryna focus my breath
I hope the doc doesn't up my dosage

[Verse 1]
Today I got so fucking angry at this stupid life
My 3 year old son asked me what school was like
At first I didn't think much of it
Till' I started to explain it, conversation turned so rugged
I was like "it's lots of fun
Lots of teachers, lots of books, lots of playgrounds
You can run, you can paint, color, read, learn, recess in the sun
And by the way, one day
One of your classmates might stroll in with a gun
Shoot at you, shoot at your friends, and kill himself"
I'm not tryna be a nihilist, just being real
How are parents in America supposed to really feel
When tryna get your kid an education just might get 'em killed
Frightened by the doom
So we fly 'em to the moon
Never let 'em play outside, we just hide 'em in their rooms
Like "sorry son, daddy's just fallen for the scare tactics
Here's an iPad, stare at it
Forever"

[Verse 2]
It's saturday, and there's no chance I'm going out tonight
What are you crazy? I'm sittin' on the couch tonight
There's no way I'm gonna get in the car
And go and hang around a bunch of drunk kids at a bar
The last time I went, I just wasn't prepared
The vibe in the air had me genuinely scared
I mean, dudes are buff, dudes are mean, dudes are angry
I held the door open for one, he didn't thank me
He was showin' off his biceps
He could prolly bench two eighty five for 8 or nine reps
He had me feelin' kinda bitch made
When 50 Cent first came out, he was prolly in the fifth grade
When he was playin' truth or dare
I was buyin' product so I wouldn't lose my hair
But I did, I sure the fuck did
And now I feel inadequate around a punk kid
Damn!

[Spoken]
So that's all life is huh?
Every six months go see a new supehero movie
Work a fuckin' horrible job that you hate
Get married to someone you're sexually attracted to
Only to never have sex with them again once the kids are born
Really?

[Verse 3]
I'm tryna find what my purpose is for
But I spent the last hour at the furniture store
Tryin' to locate a god damn burgundy floor mat
That we can put where the bathroom floor's at
For the last six months I've had a sore back
I used to feel, but inside I felt a cord snap
I used to have a big red heart
But now I got a big brown pile where a horse shat
I used to have a nice young face
But now I got a mask that always changes like I'm Rorschach
I used to want a Porsche
Instead I had a family
So now I'm tryin' to locate where my Ford's at
Sittin' in the home depot parkin' lot
Humid outside, august night, dark and hot
The moon is beautiful this evening it's rare
But honestly, I don't even think that I care
Fuck the moon
