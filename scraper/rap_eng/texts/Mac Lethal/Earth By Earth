[Verse 1]
You looking at a cock-eyed skitz
Anybody wanna try to rock like this?
They can't, they get my cock, my fist
My blood, my glitz my sanity
HOLY CALAMITY
Test the jester with the voodoo dolls
Better get the stretcher when I chew through walls
They'll be coming to identify the body with a bunch of paramedics
And a regiment of never ending enemas
They giving in abundance
All the sycophants are wondering so insignificantly
In a fucking daze, you lessened in control and it's killing me
Now it's suppressing my vulnerability
I sure just like invading space
In circa nineteen eighty-eight
The turpentine just made me faint
But purple ice cream tasted great, wait!

[HOOK]
Someone please remove me from this earth
I would rather rot until I died upon this earth
You should not have wiped away the filthy after-birth
Nail a pair of wings to me and I'll depart the earth
Someone please remove me from this god-forsaken earth
I would rather rot until I died upon this earth
You should not have wiped away the filthy after-birth
Nail a pair of wings to me and I'll depart the earth by earth

[Verse 2]
I speak the fire sing language, I dance like a spider-spined aphid
(aphid aphid)
I speak the fire sign language, I dance like a spider-spined aphid
That's aimless at making anguish like a dangerous sadist
Relaying the dead-pan abrasiveness
I play shows for radio head fans and waitresses

(and I liked the first radio head album, so chew on that)

Damn
Since the days they was hand-piking slaves
Man smitten with an antenna transmittin' waves
Now to the canned chicken glaze gettin' televised praise
Like our vegetables doused in pesticide sprays
A bunch of petrified gays that can't get married with the laws
And ancillary little flaws
Expect an ice age
I do my best for five days
And make $8.50
I'm getting out of this mice cage y'all break with me

[HOOK]
Someone please remove me from this earth
I would rather rot until I died upon this earth
You should not have wiped away the filthy after-birth
Nail a pair of wings to me and I'll depart the earth
Someone please remove me from this god-forsaken earth
I would rather rot until I died upon this earth
You should not have wiped away the filthy after-birth
Nail a pair of wings to me and I'll depart the earth by earth
