[Intro: Sample]

Greetings my friend… we are all interested in the future, for this is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives. You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable. That is why you are here. And now, for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happens on that faithful day

[Verse 1]
The story of the moon and how it flies
‘Ey, check it out. Yo yo
Remove the horns, this troubadour will separate himself from you
When you're deform, you do the core damage that I cannot complain about
See bitch, you’re poisoned inside – now drain it out
And swim inside the toxic waste
Once you provide me conquered space
You face the chariots, they leave a couple times
And our scalpel at your Goldilocks just dangles
From a chocolate tower castle which
I taste the sour apple fragrance
As it emanates, from of the sacred dinner plates
I bang with cadence
Came to my senses, now religiously I aim at
The princes, aces and winches
I can tell by your face with the stitches
You hate the stink of when I shrink you down to size
This is the story of the beast and how it dies
So die little bastard die
When in doubt, just spit it out
And live without these murders
And I’m content to trode these satin curtains
I splatter certain elements
It’s messy
It’s top heavy
Some of them are not ready
Fumble in the pock that fed me
And I’ve been taking on responsibilities I shouldn’t
Fuck it, I don’t care, at least my teeth ain’t crooked
At least my teeth ain’t wooden
All ye faithful, now the pivot twist
Tangled your remembrance
The playful of maliciousness
That I was dealt
Besides my head
You’ll find a cushion – sleep away
Lie in bed – keep the faith
Jesus came to die instead
Died in his sleep
He doesn’t lie, doesn’t speak
Now he’s got iron fatigue
He doesn’t cry, doesn’t weep
Doesn’t blink
He doesn’t think
When he slinks you down to size
That’s the story of the beast and how it dies
So die little bastard die
Tried with your alibi and tell you that I’m scared
But just remember that nobody cares
And just remember that the disrepair with all we feel
Is the reason these are temporary shields
So kneel, so peel away your skin now
And show your true colors
And I’ma swallow all the moons thunder
Motherfucker

[Interlude: Sample]
Throughout the years I have told you all the almost unbelievable relations to the unreal
And soon this is to be more than facts
Now I tell you a tale of a special people
So astounding that some of you might think
This is the story of those in the Twilight Time
Once human – now monsters
In a world between the living and the dead

[Hook]
When the world goes pop, when the world goes pop pop
And blows us all to fragments
My heart will still be beating out of habit
When the world goes pop, when the world goes pop pop
The skies will fill with ashes
I went through sanity through all the flashes
When the world goes pop, when the world goes pop pop
And blows us all to fragments
My heart will still be beating out of habit

[Verse 2]
From the waist to the teeth
With the flow black out
To the dirty old peeps
In the old crack house
This be the place where the crows lap routes
Chuckled, thumbtack stuck to my knuckles
My suicidal tendencies
Can prove a vital friend of me
I got a basement downstairs
With a room to hide my enemies
Get a frieze, shit, get a noose
When I hit ‘em with a hitter that they never felt
Beat ‘em with a leather belt
Take ‘em to a previum that’s easy
Break my brain to pieces on CD
Creatures a people in 3D
The darkness and kingdom will feed me
But they’re struggling to keep me alive
Me and Swab - Twilight Time

[Sample]
Uh, another wasted day
Slips away my Twilight Time

[Mac Lethal]
And that’s the story of the beast and how it dies!

[Sample]
Come on ye faithful
Show me the answer lies within your mind
Uh, just stop
Take the time to look around
Reality’s a bitter pill
The taste of hatred
That sends all hopes
Crashing down
