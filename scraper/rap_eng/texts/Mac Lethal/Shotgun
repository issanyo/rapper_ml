[Intro]
Ay, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Apparently I talk really funny
(You say your "R's" funny!)
We talk like Dan Rather is supposed to talk
People that do news get trained to speak like we do
Mid-Westerners talk correctly
Yo, ahem

[Verse 1]
I was born on July 47th
Always had a passion for the demons the hellions
And the weapons, I'm telling you any second
I'ma burst the metal barricade
Take a JÃ¤gerbomb and I'll rehearse the Devil's serenade
[?], calm and guilty of petty murder
Smoked out, sloppy and grilling a veggie burger
You drilling the head berserker?
Man, I'm 10"2', I got a pack of Marijuana flavored
Big League Chew, and I've been bitter at the world
Since they cancelled Seinfeld
Leash up the mic with my damn [?]
I got [?], so I can hump her
Put your hands up if your friends talk shit on each other
(Motherfucker!!)
She fell from a [?]
Like when how [?] was telling her dick and fart jokes
I wanna make the sweat boil in your palms
I live at hotels like I'm Royal [?]
I'm losing nothing, I'm spinning, I chew 'em up
With the rhythm, the illest rapper that's with 'em
Man, who the fuck are you kiding?
I'm bruising up and I'm splintering
Your state of mind, now whose Crew-Cut
Rules in '89? (Mine!)

[Hook]
I got a shotgun pointing at the radio
I swear to God I'm bout to pull it back and make it blow
I got a shotgun pointing at the ceiling
Mac Lethal is brilliant (brilliant!!)
I got a shotgun pointing at the radio
I swear to God I'm bout to pull it back and make it blow
I got a shotgun pointing at the ceiling
Mac Lethal is...

[Verse 2]
And no, Fox News is not CBS
It's all a bunch of blue-eyed not CBS
And yes (yes), I come from Kansas City, but no (no)
My friends don't have sex with the relatives
I lived in Raytown right down near Overland Park
Where all the women got teeth that are glow in the dark
And all the streets are patrolled by remote-control creepy Gorillas
I be dressing like I'm Ichi The Killer
I chase Scallywags like a pimp from Compton
With a hoodie and a crush on 6 from Blossom
Lethal in your town, people hit the ground
These goddamn rappers probably tinkle sitting down
My signal spins around 'til my Rap City kicks you
I tradgically rip through and stick another catheter in you
I rip 'em with the [?] grin too, with rhythm in my hips
Like I was Ravishing Rick Rude
Rappers have misused the rules of the rhythm
Such a silly ass fool, this decision I'm [?]
And I am not ashamed I have Vanilla Ice's first album
Everybody listen and dig to it

[Hook]
I got a shotgun pointing at the radio
I swear to God I'm bout to pull it back and make it blow
I got a shotgun pointing at the ceiling
Mac Lethal is brilliant (brilliant!!)
I got a shotgun pointing at the radio
I swear to God I'm bout to pull it back and make it blow
I got a shotgun pointing at the ceiling
I'm bout to get brilliant!

[Outro]
DJ Platinum, pull that trigger
