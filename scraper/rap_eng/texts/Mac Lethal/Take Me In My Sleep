[Verse 1]
My mama's in the hospital because she's got a lung disease
She has to wear oxygen tanks or it's tough to breathe
There's no god-given magic tricks up her sleeves
Just an IV tube full of morphine
To numb the greed of the doctors and the damages
Using $30,000 dollar hospital bills as bandages
Diagnosed with little to no chances
Until she's crucified on the brittlest old branches
I really hit the nail on the head with that one
Moon skin feels so pale to the red and black sun
Born dead the day Mother Nature miscarried it
Life is nothing but a bowl of cherry pits
My mama barefaced like the belly of a beetle
Puffy from the steroids and medicine they feed you
I soak brain water from the crevices and wrinkles with a sponge
Settlement for people when they plunge
Underwater, broken tail, lunged fish
I'm not happy here
Twirling fingers in my salt-water taffy tears
This whole career thing still isn't in effect
So we wrap birthday presents in disability checks
You ever pushed your mother in a wheelchair through the store
'Cuz her back's broken, body won't heal there anymore?
If so, you know the answer to the question
Please take me in my sleep, just don't take me to Heaven
And I could quilt you a springtime sweater
Please, Mama Bear get better

[Hook]
(Singing this song for my mother
Singing this song for the joy she brings)
Take me in my sleep
Just don't take me to Heaven
Take me in my sleep

[Verse 2]
Searching for happiness inside is what I do
But rainbows are shaped like frowns and the sky is blue
And every night the sun goes down upon his girlfriend in turn meaning the light of mine is through
In blackness, balloons float away with a string still attached or deflate so I sing 'till it cracks
And happy kittens get stuck in happy little trees
Which get chopped down and used to crucify kings
Well, hydroponic clovers say my luck might drown
So I suggest you crucify me upside down
I'll re-adjust my crown of thorns to be a flotation device
Gash a typhoon until my art sucks highbrow
Right now I'm too trite to be elite
But I'm borderline born and too bright be a sheep
I keep grim benefits, faithfully I reap
But I'm skeptical, take me in my sleep
Am I too passionate?
I mean what the fuck am I doing here?
Can you relate to my anger problems and Goofy ears?
Crack my heart open, scrape the bottom for souvenirs
I make this face talking the Moon to tears
No, I won't say my old lady's name
But she decorates her lungs on the coal-freighting train
When the track switches over to a toll-paying lane
I feel no ecstasy, it's no role-playing game
Hydroponic flowers say my luck might drown
So I say turn that smile upside down
I'll re-adjust that gown to be a springtime sweater
Please Mama Bear get better
And I'm ashamed of myself, I can't do no better
Please Mama Bear get better

[Hook]

Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't put a smile on your face without you
Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't stand up straight, I don't know how to
Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't put a smile on your face without you
Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't stand up straight
Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't put a smile on your face without you
Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't stand up straight, I don't know how to
Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't put a smile on your face without you
Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't...
Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't put a smile on your face without you
Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't stand up straight, I'll drown without you
Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't put a smile on your face without you
Ashamed of myself, Mama don't go
I can't stand up straight...
...Without you

Thank you
