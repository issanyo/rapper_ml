[Verse 1]
I adamantly attack the alphabet
With an anecdotal algorithm made of Adamantium
I'm like an Adderrall addicted anaconda or an alcoholic
Or an asshole, like A-Rod, no anabolics
But I, brutally and beautifully butcher the banging beat
Brushin' bubbly allover your booby and booty beef
Cause I'm a carpenter, I come carvin' your carcass
Leaving all these carp fish crushed on the carpet
Crumble chron' in Colorado with my Cal cronies
I'm Crammin' it full of condiments like it's a Calzone delicious!
I didn't drive and drink
Whether diamonds or dimes man I'm diving deep like an
Electric eel, I'm elegantly eloquent and every cent I've ever earned
Just entered me in the election
I got eleven brains like an enormously educated Einstein with Elephantitis
Of the erection
A freak! I'm fighting with a flatfooted felon
Five falcons just flew to a fountain, and fell in
Googling, googly-eyed girls to get inside
Golly gee from GlasGow to Guatemela's gentrified
A hippopotamus is high on heroin he heckles me
And hires Haitian Hank to hand his ho a hysterectomy
In hateful hieroglyph I hurl-out hyperbolic hubris
And hang with Hipster Helen that's the hooker with the huge hips
I'm ill. I'm Icarus. I ignite idiots in idioms and issues
Jumpy jargon I joust like Jacare jivin Japanese Judo and Jiujitsu
Killin' em like a kid.. got a Kilogram of Ketamine for Kwanza
Knit a Kimono made of Komodo Dragon skin
I'm rich like a Klingon that be kicking it at the Kremlin
But I'm kicking through your door, call me Kramer Kardashian
Lethal, Literally litter a little limerick
That be littler than a Leprechaun
A menace that'll manifest the melancholy mayhem
Makin a metamorphosis until I'm mechanized like Megatron
Nick Nolte: a nerdy native of Nebraska
Needs a neon ninja and a nectarine from NASA
Ominously, I mean it's obvious you see a:
Orthodontist oozing out oodles of onomatopoeia
Oswalt: Patton
Pickin a pocket pluckin a patent
I pickle purple poop in Patron for pure passion
I got a question, I gotta quiz ya'
Lets step on the gas and go quicker
Really getting ready for the revolution
Reeled a rotten rhythm ring around a Russia Ronda Rousey resort
Serve a simple sentiment a simile that's smokin
Like a sheet of Sudafed i'm swiftly swimming like a seahorse
Titties on Atilla Tell a teller that'll toe tag
Terminator gun inside a turtle tattered tote bag
Thugs are un-american unattractive  and unwanted as an ugly pair of ugg's
Vivid and vivaciously venomous
With the wicked wombats only walking where women is
Gettin xenophobic at the Xanadu
