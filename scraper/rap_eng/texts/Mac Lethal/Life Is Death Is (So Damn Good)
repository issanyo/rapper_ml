[Verse 1]
Life is, nothing but pain and crisis, and little bitty slices, of death and trying to gauge the depth of how deep the black ice is
There's a hammer in my fist, as I write this, righteous, verse an', lyrics of lifeless persons, spirit turns to ices
And it rises
Deified, these words should be inscribed into the horizons, and the bleeding skies, as the Mayans
Countin' 365 on a calendar stone with a mask in the middle as I'm sippin' on a flask of a little goat blood that the kid'll soak up, during sacrifices, fuck who you think raps the nicest
These are songs that I'm saving lives with, dryin' eyelids
Providin' my kids, with a vibe that's timeless, and a time that's vibrance is so hard to find it you might need (typhen hydra[?])
Man, I got goals and aspirations but I don't, have, dreams

[Chorus]
Cause dreams are just your memories bein' organized and processed
And when you're asleep you can't make progress, on your conquest
During the onset of REM sleep they say beauty is skin deep
Man beauty ain't skin deep, beauty is just skin, cheap
Little, cleche's and platitudes
Get a mean face, get an attitude
Get a gun, get a horse, get a nice pair of boots, get a clean shave and a saddle too
And ride up outta town, try to find the sun and get so high you die as it comes down if they like you you'll be found

I can't accelerate the time, bloody hell is on my mind, but at least I'm feeling so damn good
And in my life man everything is grey, even death might come today, but at least I'm feeling so damn good
It's strange I can't accelerate the time, bloody hell is on my mind, but at least I'm feeling so damn good
And in my life man everything is grey, even death might come today, but at least I'm feeling so damn good

[Verse 2]
Death is, the day they find you breathless, left with, no comprehension of the day you once thought life was precious
Now press this
Pen to the page and write your death wish
Aight done
Got a little way cause I'm blinded by the white sun, by the white sun
I'm sick of all the fame
It's like a ball and chain
And I ain't calling names, but a met a couple celebrities recently but fuck if they ain't all insane
Every single one of them they all the name, I don't got a mansion they call me lame
They call and ask if I can get them a baller cane
And when I tell them hell no they never call again
Because that's not me, I give a damn about the damn paparazzi, I don't ever want to meet a man
I don't wanna compromise my sound no care of the means that I'm never gonna be the man
All you little juvenile motherfuckers you can run around trying to be the king of rap
And I'mma be the best husband, and be the best father to my little boy, little boy, tell me what you think of that?
Probably think it's wack, you'd rather just have money and clothes
Nothin' really matters like that, as long as you get to stunnin' these hoes
But you're stuntin' your growth
I wanna just bloody your nose
Damn, stop numbing your soul
Try to have a little fucking control
But you can't cause I'm here, oh my god, motherfucking damn it's my year
I'm in your mouth like a can of light beer
Keeping count of the planet's lightyears
I'm workin' in these boots and old ass jeans, see I got goals and aspirations but I don't have dreams

[Chorus]
Cause dreams are just your memories bein' organized and processed
And when you're asleep you can't make progress, on your conquest
During the onset of REM sleep they say beauty is skin deep
Man beauty ain't skin deep, beauty is just skin, and it's fucking cheap!

I can't accelerate the time, bloody hell is on my mind, but at least I'm feeling so damn good
And in my life man everything is grey, even death might come today, but at least I'm feeling so damn good
I say I can't accelerate the time, bloody hell is on my mind, but at least I'm feeling so damn good
And in my life man everything is grey, even death might come today, but at least I'm feeling so damn good
