Gears of War. Xbox Live. You suck, faggot. I killed you. This is a demo dedicated to everyone that whooped my ass. I didn't even know how to reload my weapon, they wouldn't tell me


Yo, one piece of bread plus one piece of bread
Plus two little packages of peanut butter spread
Equals dinner, we gotta share it
Let me spoil you for being such a great parent
I just paid the mortgage and paid for the gas
And our son's medical expenses in full with cash
Hopefully they'll turn the power back on but if they don't
We can't do a thing about it babe, cause we too broke
See, you hoped as a young Irish lass
That you'd meet a slick gentleman with style and class
With the world on a string and a powerful mouth
Till you moved in with me and the power is out
And what I have to offer you ain't the least bit nifty
A peanut butter sandwich you gotta split with me
So, light a candle and flavor up the night
It's a special occasion, baby, savor every bite

Chorus
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside

One Irish man plus one Irish lady
Plus a ten month old epileptic baby
Equals a lot of tiny seizures in the same day
Electric pulses feeding off his brain waves
And there's a lot of little things I got the urge to do
Take the wooden spoon from his mouth, stir the stew
Serve it to him and the blue lights in his head
And we can settle for the two slices of bread
It's all we can afford, we don't gotta choice
I just wanna watch you raise your little boy
I swear to god babe if I get rich
I'm gonna find a way to stop the damn seismic twitch
In his mind, the boy's been defined as special needs
And Imma search till I find that devil's seed
Planted, tell them we can not afford much else
Baby please just enjoy that sandwich

Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside

One neurologist plus one Mayo clinic
Plus a scalp EEG every time we visit
Equals you and me sittin here on the couch
And I don't gotta dime to take you out
I'm still so impressed with the way you act like it doesn't bother you
Maybe I'm wrong though, maybe it doesn't
Cause I genuinely feel you wouldn't change him if you could
You'd carve him a halo out of wood
Cause electric current can pass through metal and shock those smiles
When a charge is produced by a snot-nosed child
So harmless and cute, when sipping from his baby bottle too
But that's what I have to offer you
What I have to offer you ain't the least bit nifty
A life full of burdens you gotta split with me
An undertow of debt making me 360 (*Thanks Nic Swaner for correction*), but fuck it
As long as it's with you, I love it

Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside
Matter of fact Imma love you like that
Cause you're so beautiful on the inside

We gotta get to thirty songs...
