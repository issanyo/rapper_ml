[Verse 1]

I just wanna rap for 90 seconds without breathing
Here we go I'm gonna try it hopefully I won't be screaming
By the end of it I cannot take a single breath man not even a little bit
I hope this ain't a target that I didn't hit
And all these rappers out right now are faker than an Instagram booty
I'm like a Jedi when I rap I shoulda been in a movie
You gotta understand a couple things about me I'm a Kansas City native and I'm busting hella rowdy
Got a house up in the hills
I got a castle where I chill
I'm always working on my raps and always practising this skill
And you should never sleep on me like I'm a cactus in your pillow
Hear the instrumental then I kick a track out with a steel toe
Everybody listening to all this mumble rap is terrible
You open up my brain I bet it is 24-carat gold
You know that when I rap it's hella dope sit hear the vibes your on my
Youtube channel now oh man I hope you will subscribe so look
Somebody tried to say that when you're living underwater it's impossible to breathe and I just gotta disagree
Cause when I'm rapping not a single bit of oxygen is sitting in my lungs and I'm relaxing at the bottom of the sea
You see my wife and I were riding in the car today and started fighting
And I just left her walked into the studio and started writing
I decided that I was gonna rap without a single breath
And never did it bring my death
But fuck it it would be refreshing
I am a believer in the universe's sorrow
I just wish that I could move away to Jupiter tomorrow
Time and time again I sit around I'm patiently just waiting for the weekend
20,000 years ago I was a pharaoh back in Egypt with a coat of gold and feathers and a crown of thorns
See I invented thunderstorms and all the ways that clouds could form
See I was born abused as ginger going to the kingdom of the science and my mother was a singer to the sciences
I navigate the globe they call me leader to the lions
And my wings are made of fire
I'ma bring you to the tiger
I'ma feed you to a tiger motherfucker I cannot breathe
I'm forgetting the lyrics anybody gonna try to leave
I gotta try to mumble now I gotta do a freestyle
Everybody knows that I'm gonna get a little senile
One-fifteen one-sixteen
ARGH!
