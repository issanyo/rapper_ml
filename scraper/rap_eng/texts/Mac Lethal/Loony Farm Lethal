Signing on
Yeah, I got...
I no longer have a problem with just...getting on the mic and busting somebody's ass real quick
No problem
At all
Heh

[Verse]
So open up the wound, I gotta try to poke the IV
The Clover is employee owned like your local Hy-Vee
I'm busting Soulja Boy's ass sort of like Ice T
But I'm Joaquin Sorolla, strike three
Spit ball, shit y'all
I jigsaw y'all bitches with the pick/saw
Like BAM BAM, I'm going in your bitch raw
Until I catch a break or else I pitall
You can stand by me but I'mma be like "Chopper, sic balls"
Loony loony, flow has basically been reinvented
See, I got razor teeth I keep cemented here to my gums
I'm an atheist but Jesus did it, here here I come
Call me hippie, I'mma save a tree and beat you with it until you're numb
See, I be grinning at your perfect daughters
And I'mma skin 'em at the turkey slaughter
Swimming through the murky water
I burst the fodder in the cannon in the blood-soaked winter
Off the double X cut throat liquor triple x poke
Gun show, you choke on the gun smoke
You're full of shit rapping about your quote money unquote
It's all right, though
It's 70 and sunny and it's not a real motherfucking wedding until it's bloody
Put your dress on
I'm slept on so heavily baby, like a Motel 6 bed infested with scabies
I'm a pigheaded rednose infected with rabies
And I'mma serve a definite maybe to you, yeah
I gotta get the money back that I lost last night at the casino
Playing drunk, playing stupid, say what's up
I'm a superhuman demon with the cards
Think I'm hard to swallow now, wait until I'm squeezing through your jar
Like Lexington Steele, I got the sexy appeal
I eat the nutrients and leave the freaking vegetable peel
On the ground, cop a feel on the thick round booty
All else is just get out oohwees
God help the loony, Loony Farm Lethal
Got a Louisville Slugger that will alter your beauty
Swing batter batter batter
Even as a rookie, flowed fatter than a tummy full of cookie dough batter
I'mma splatter all these rappers into anti-matter and pan fry every single one of them
Just to have some fun with them
Smoking on a nickel bag of onion skin then I'mma get some kitty at the Lover's Den
It's all about the Benjamins, wait, it's all about the binge, amen
I purge, I blend, converge the surge, the trends, emerges again
People so fucking desperate for a purpose within
Well, I'll give it to you girl, put your clothes on
I don't care how physically attractive you are
Goodbye, so long
My fuse is only so long and you can't blow coke on it
Or drink through it until you slow vomit

[Ad lib]
Get the fuck out of here
YOU CAN'T FUCK WITH ME!
