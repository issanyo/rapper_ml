Ahhhhhh

And I remember back when I was twenty-five
When I was still young, still tender
Still passionate with sunny vibes
Before the rain before the tragedies and bloody skies
Before my memories were massacred to mummified
Sippin on a rox glass warm scotch cold ice
I like relaxin don't mistake that for a dull life
My whole life it's been really hard to breathe
I've been waiting on a person
That will finally put my heart to ease
I weave through the carbon freeze
Wind blows through the scarlet trees
It's been years since I've felt jealousy
Since I've felt this pressure
Hell bent for leather shedding felt tip letters
So down spill your beer
You turned thirty just to realize
Everything is down hill from here
Say good bye to having party time amongst friends
And say hello to single mothers that don't trust men
This is the life

This is the life (yeah)
This is paradise (yeah)
Feeling so incredible my head is filled with vices
This is the life (yeah)
Livin with no spite (yeah)
There is not a reason to be evil and divisive
You know all my friends know that my heart is like a drum
My heart is like a war drum
All my friends know that my heart is like a drum
My heart is like a war drum

Me and my ex girl Israel and Palestine
Same thing it's never too early for a glass of wine
The shutters go bang
You feeling predator you've gone bloodied those fangs
It's so strange
Some times I'm such a grumpy old thing
That I take a little bump of cocaine
Just to lubricate me socially
Hate is not the opposite of love no it isn't
The opposite of love is indifference
And it's suppose to be
I feel and unadulterated adulation
For the people are close to me
I mean for the people I abuse
It's never been a secret that I go
From hot to freezing with my moods
So here's a ghost for free
You spend your whole life rejecting
Who your parents told you you were suppose to be
But I guess it doesn't feel like it's your life
Till you grow up an you realize they were right
Baby this is the life

This is the life (yeah)
This is paradise (yeah)
Feeling so incredible my head is filled with vices
This is the life (yeah)
Livin with no spite (yeah)
There is not a reason to be evil and divisive
You know all my friends know
That my heart is like a drum
My heart is like a war drum
All my friends know that my heart is like a drum
My heart is like a war drum

So I'm quilting the seasons together
Guilty to thinking forever
Will be the reason I wanna settle it down
I think I'm building it evenly
Roof and ceiling is keeping me
From the millions of evil
People meddlesome clowns(get down)
Just because I'm atheist don't mean the devil is around
Just means the faith you spit to me was letting me down
I don't find human beings supreme
I don't think privileged to know what life means
This is the life
Where you could make a hundred million dollars
Selling Christ if you work the angles right
Polish them and shine them till you turn the halos bright
Add a sense of urgency and surely they gonna bite
You know who else would do that
A certain angel might but I don't believe in Satan
Don't believe in wrong or right
Nope I just believe in protect those that need it
And if you make a fuck up don't repeat it Jesus Christ

This is the life (yeah)
This is paradise (yeah)
Feeling so incredible my head is filled with vices
This is the life (yeah)
Livin with no spite (yeah)
There is not a reason to be evil and divisive
You know all my friends know
That my heart is like a drum
My heart is like a war drum
All my friends know that my heart is like a drum
My heart is like a war drum
