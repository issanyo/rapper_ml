And another one
Just another day in October, I'm getting wrinkles and my hair is getting grey cause I'm older
And another one
My friend Ryan and his wife are pregnant with a little girl and man, I cannot wait 'til I hold her
And another one

[Verse 1]
Fall is all mellow days, so what?
Drink a little apple cider, eat some glazed donuts
I spend a lot of time wishing I can live in LA
But it was chilly yesterday in KC and it felt great
I had the 10 AM and I'm already drunk face
Wore the same hoodie everyday for a month straight
The sky was looking like a dream and shit
My son would tell you but he's only two and he don't speak English yet
But, it was gorgeous, enormous
Seeing all the Jack-o'-lanterns on my neighbors porches
Sometimes I get so drunk I don't know where my porch is
And that's probably the reason that I'll never make the Forbes list
Cause waking up to hustle isn't fun
When I'm in my warm bed tryna snuggle with my son
Cause man, this little fucker has a cute ass snore
We took a nap until two past four

[Hook]
Then we went and took another one
Just another day in October, I'm getting wrinkles and my hair is getting grey cause I'm older
And another one
My friend Ryan and his wife are pregnant with a little girl and man, I cannot wait 'til I hold her
And another one

[Verse 2]
My wife wants another one
Another baby, a daughter, or another son
These are the things that make me wanna drink buttered rum
We're comfortable but we cannot spare another crumb
Where we gonna get the money to replace our gutters from?
Plus the engine in our Nissan sputters some
We need to fix that, I wish I was dumb and young
Cause all I want to do is have fucking fun
But all I get to do is find fucking funds
And all I get to do is try to pay my bills
And if I want to find a little balance in my life I gotta make sure I eat veggies and take my pills
But I don't mean the pills that you get for pain
You know I mean the pills that untwist my brain
I went and barfed in the drain
Because I had too many whiskey plain

[Hook]
So I went and had another one
Just another day in October, I'm getting wrinkles and my hair is getting grey cause I'm older
And another one
My friend Ryan and his wife are pregnant with a little girl and man, I cannot wait 'til I hold her
And another one
Just another day in October, I'm getting wrinkles and my hair is getting grey cause I'm older
And another one
My friend Ryan and his wife are pregnant with a little girl and man, I cannot wait 'til I hold her
Congratulations, and another one
