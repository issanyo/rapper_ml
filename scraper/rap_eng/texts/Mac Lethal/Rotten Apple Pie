[Verse 1: Mac Lethal]
Somebody said the classics never go outta style
But thats a stupid thing to say because they actually do
And judgein' by the people that are settin all the standards
All of us go outta style too
Oh Lordy Loo
I swear to christ Im sure to screw or somethin
Now the only music bumpin is that 1980s band es pop rap
Id rather beat a dead horse than throw a saddle on it and ride it (man it ain't goin nowhere)
You ever seen an irish pot head that flows with no hair?
I gotta little buddah belly but I dont really care
See I could never date a girl thats on a magazine cover
Cause self absorbed women dont make good lovers mother fucker
Just because its hard to write dont make it smart and bright im painten with the mothers of invention
Bring my art to life
Deliver menacing glows and now my nicotene flows throughout my bloodstream so im'a give a rivet and show and paint a message its like i scraped the edges of my razor up against my wrist but eh...its nothin major cuz only punk mother fuckers call the cops and blow a hot bubble a poison till it pops

Now you can find me in the burgs
And you can find me in the streets
Until you wonder what happened to me...to me
You gotta trust that im just smokin' somethin
Dealin with the motions, pumpin beats, tryna set the style free
I wanna piece of the rotten apple pie
Gotta make it bounce cuz you know its do or die
I wanna piece of the rotten apple pie
I gotta make it bounce cuz you know its do or die

In 1997 I smack my teacher with my purple trapper keep her rockin n stand stiff
In a old dirty bastard t-shirt
Bingo, now im hittin a six in a highschool lunchroom
With liquor to mix. I wish that i could get pregnant with ava gardners children
Instead im doin the twirl, as i watch text messages ruin the world
And technology period
Im waitin for the day we can all burn copies of eachothers girlfriends and skip the technology period
Cause Aunt Flow's an old fashioned gal, and computer love just ain't her style (gross)
Lordy Lou all I wanna do is make it til I'm 42 so I can feel just in every grouchy thing I say or do
Until then you better watch out for that tailspin
No I'm not a rapper I'm a used car salesman
