Welcome to 2011!
We're gonna change things up this year

I'm not addicted anymore
I'm finally free to think
Walking backwards looking at the universe I see it shrink
Tellin' every empty soul to slow it down and hit control
It's so profound I'm walkin' over open ground on tipsy toes
Serve a shot of whiskey froze
Clip a set of angel wings
We just kiss each other to avoid saying hateful things
More is in the picture than my selfish old face
I'm at a gorgeous wedding by myself with no date

Panic stricken, head is swollen, I can't be forever soulin'
Halfway through I fell asleep and woke up with the credits rollin'
When you're at the top you feel alone, so every year I kill the king and let another person take the throne
Fish bones, alcoholic genes, vitriolic poems
White women call it the type place you don't walk alone
White men call it a place that you'll get your wallet stolen'
White kids call it scary
Black people call it home

Mac Lethal, maricon
Crack feeble, collar bones
I am god, y'all are just some carbon clones
Garden gnomes that probably had some big plans on New Year's Eve
Even though it never makes the fuckin' blue tears leave
I'm gonna die twice, I'm gonna die twice
Once when I stop breathing
Once when y'all forget what I write
My name is Mac Lethal and kid I'm the prime minister
Today I passed a bill to give kittens to life prisoners
(Therapeutic reasons, you know?)

Kids always think they're smarter than adults, til they grow up and they realize life is harder as adults

Kids always think they're smarter than adults, til they grow up and they realize life is harder-

I swear to god, I'm scared shitless
Stuck on these mountains, and they're cliffless
No place for me to jump, no audience to bear witness
Their interest, has dwindled down to glimpses
For instance, even in Kansas City now I'm vintage
I'm trying hard to break away from underground hip hop, cause 99 percent of ya'll are gossipy bitches
So here's a warning shot
Keep talking that shit that you're talking and I promise that I gotta get vicious
I'm sorry ya'll I made a mistake
I let a couple fans get too close and now my real family sees a ghost at the dinner table
Silent, freshly home from tour but I don't even wanna tell the stories about the places I went
I just wanna listen
I just wanna listen to the friction
I'm comfortable surrounded by addiction
See, I don't even wait for 5 o'clock
Lately I just wake up
Eat my lunch, make a drink, roll some pot and then I just grin

(It's what happened to me, dude.)
