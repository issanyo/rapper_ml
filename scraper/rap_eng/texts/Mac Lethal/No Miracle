[Intro: Irish goodbye means you just leave the bar without
Telling anyone goodbye...like I plan on leaving hip-hop
I work really fucking hard, I don't deserve the hatred and bitterness I get
One day I'm gonna be out of here...you won't even know it.]

It seems like every time I got my hopes up
I just hung a rope up
Kicked the chair from under me and hung until I choked but
I never got to see heaven's glorious bells
All I got's a couple scars and a couple stories to tell
Lonely narratives, alcoholism deep in my heritage
It's never gonna be perfect--accept it, learn to cherish it
You see, I had dreams of being a superstar
Popping open champagne in limos, stealing groupies' hearts
The truth about this game will make you truly barf
To even move this far, I worked stupid hard
So this was no surprise--know it, I said it
This is not an accident; I sent a goal and I met it
Sometimes you gotta give yourself some credit
Face it, there's good reward in working hard and staying dedicated
Keep it consistent, keep the work flow steady and patient
And once your goals are met, you can take a vacation

I never looked at hard work as unbearable
So when I'm successful, it's no miracle
I never looked at hard work as unbearable
So when I'm successful, it's no miracle

The biggest fear when writing music is
I'll one day have to sing it on a wedding or a cruise ship
To an apathetic audience while begging for amusement
These two bit pricks don't realize it's my passion, it's my passion, that's some true shit
You know some soccer mom, clearly she don't like my songs
Biting a martini olive off a toothpick like "who's this?"
Uh, my name's Mac Lethal and I wasted fifteen years of my life on this, you rude bitch
Nah, that didn't happen; fuck, I'm getting famous
My fans are saying I'm a sellout, that's how sick this game is
I ain't doing circus tricks or kissing anus
I still got my dignity and kid to me, that isn't shit to play with
Stop making twisted faces, man, don't be pathetic
This was not an accident--I set a goal and I met it
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up
I got some new enemies, old friends grow the fuck up

I never looked at hard work as unbearable
So when I'm successful, it's no miracle
Nah! I never looked at hard work as unbearable
So, so when I'm successful, it's no miracle

I never been the type to give my demo tape to famous people
A good or bad opinion from 'em never made me lethal
I never chased celebrities or sweat 'em up a tree
Instead blew the underground apart and let 'em come to me
Cause I'm the brainy type
Taming cash, one half Damon Dash, other half Dana White
With a big artsy spirit, man, the world's my oyster
Judge me for that, and not the girls I cloister
Wait! Hold up, hold up
I can taste my Paxil, I break my capsule
Or take five Advil
But every time I smoke weed it makes life fragile
So before you offer it, just say "bye" asshole
Here, have a cock to suck and pull
I got some goals to reach, man, rock and fucking roll
I'm 'bout to sink they battleship
See, work ethic plus passionate equals success that's no accident

Nah! I never looked at hard work as unbearable
So, so, uh, when I'm successful, it's no miracle
No sir, I never looked at hard work as unbearable
So when I'm, so when I'm, so when I'm successful, it's no miracle
