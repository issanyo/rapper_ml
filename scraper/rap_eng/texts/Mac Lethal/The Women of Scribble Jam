[Intro] [Mac Lethal talking]
Aye man. Yeah, man why don't you battle me man?
I heard you like, freestyle and stuff
Yo, man. I ain't tryin' to do no broads
Ayo, A-Train. Yo, A-Train, give me a beatbox man, c'mon

[Verse One] [Mac Lethal]
Murs change crews but he should change shoes
Quick, cause his girlfriend stinks when I kiss her
He probably brush his teeth with wood grain glue. stick
Hey Murs, what you think of me mister?

[Murs]
You finished? Yeah, great
Man find me a date
How come you never get me laid when I'm in your state?
Man, I have blue balls, so fuck a blue tape
I'm tryin' to find a b-girl that wanna to eat a tube steak

[Mac Lethal]
Cause they're all vegetarians and don't chew meat
They're rather have a Kansas City tofu treat
Or they're pregnant in the kitchen and they're pushin' out my babies
Battle me, quit lookin' at the ladies

[Murs]
But did you see that chick with my CD in her hand? (No)
I hope I'm the reason that she came to Scribble Jam
To watch the MC Battle while we hold hands
Wait, she's talkin' to Pace, hope I still gotta chance

[Mac Lethal]
Pace gets girls that ain't even in your roll call
Your beard looks like pubic hair on a troll doll
Those girl lines are from sixth grade son
I got 99 lines but a bitch ain't one
Hit me

[Murs]
Ohhh, that was vicious
Man, look at these bitches
Adidas sweatpants, tank tops so delicious
Man I'm out of town, it might not sound right
But fuck it, I might eat a little pussy tonight

[Mac Lethal]
Yo, we clash like Japaneses and American cinema
Little Murs practically, get a ?
So hey young homie, you look gay in Velcro
Probably masturbate to the Dave Chapelle show

[Murs]
The skyline chilly met a fly young Phillie
Asked if she was on the menu just tryin' to be silly
She smiled and she laughed so I had to ask her out
We fucked the shit out of each other on Mr. Dibb's couch

[Hook]
[Murs] It happens once a year in the city of Cinci
It's called Scribble Jam, a hip hop frenzy
[Mac Lethal] Some come for the shows
[Murs] Some come for the hoes
[Mac Lethal] But what happens on the road
[Murs] Stays on the road

[Verse Two] [Murs]
My first time was last summer, fell in love with this shit
Never seen so many cute hip hop chicks
First night at Top Cats caught one that was thick
Aye Mac, you listenin' or still poppin' that shit?

[Mac Lethal]
Well I live to pop shit when I rap at Scribble Jam
And you, you're like Juice's sacrificial lamb
My mom even thinks you rap cheesy
Cause Shock G had the best verse on your last CD

[Murs]
Cause Your +Mom Iz A Thug+ and she'll fuck me up
Man, I'm tryin' to lay back and get sucked up
Shut the fuck up cause you really don't know me
That's how you got that black eye to go with that trophy

[Mac Lethal]
But I pawned that trophy like a Hanzo sword
Fuck it I don't wanna battletalk no more
Cause battle rap careers
Well usually they end
So Murs introduce me to your friends

[Murs]
Them two right there, drove in from Miama
The short one's Misha, the tall one Tammy
Get your mind of the mic and tell me which one you like
Should have done this with Slug but he was booked for the night

[Mac Lethal]
Naw, Slugs always drunk, talkin' at the after party
Give me Tammy in the Hollisters & Ambercrombie
And while you sittin' there talkin' to Misha
I'mma get us four shots of Tequilla
Sit tight

[Murs]
Man, tonight is the night I think I found my wife
Diggin' through them records over there to the right
The way her thongs stickin' up out her pants got me grinnin'
Hey Mac

[Mac Lethal]
What?

[Murs]
I only come to Scribble Jam for the women

[Mac Lethal]
Murs, you were right
I just found a diva with a dark muddy mind a purse full of spikes
All up in the rental van with my vixen
I only come to Scribble Jam for the women

[Hook]

These girls are hot man. I'm glad you turned me onto them
