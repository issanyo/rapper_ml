Saturn, hahahahaha, yeah
You need a job girl
Find something to do, you know
I just hopped out, hopped out of bed
Got a couple cob webs tangled in my head
I get dressed show the world what fresh is
And then i have a bar of xanex for breakfast
Mmm, thats a tasty remedy
Last night we ran KC didn't we?
What the hell do you want me to say?
Keep it Irish get drunk every day
We stay fly like an albatross
Of this love not an ounce is lost
Black clover the style is boss
And we shallow like you
I wanna make a toast
To the renegades getting paid
In the shade drinkin lemonade
When they're selling dope
You wanna know how i live with my baby's momma?
I don't, oh let's go
Listening to my favorite song
Withe the curtains closed till the day is gone
The suns outside and the rain is warm
Ain't no radio they'll play me on
Listening to my favorite song
Don't remember what drugs im on
Don't remember what the fuck is wrong
Then it hits me again my love is gone
You know im hustling in this bitch
Im hustling to forget
Im hustling just to rinse you out of all my memories
You know im hustling in this bitch
Im husling to forget
I hustle just to rinse you out of all my memories
I just walked in, walked in the door
Shit heeled drunk, fall on the floor
I drove drunk like a durche im guessing
If I got a DUI then I'd learn my lesson
But fuck that, fuck you
You're the reason gonna deep six float right off the deep end
It was hard waking up this evening
But at 9pm i should not be sleeping
We get fly like a vulture babe
The bubblegum and the smoke is sweet
I got a new girl so discrete
And we shallow like you
I wanna make a toast
To your new boyfriend threatening he gunna kick my ass
Wanna fight me motherfucker gonna get choked
My new girl is the baddest chick
And her kiss feels like an acid trip
Listening to my favorite song
With the curtains closed till the day is gone
The sun's outside and the rain is warm
Ain't no radio they'll play me on
Listening to my favorite song
Don't remember what drugs I'm on
Dont remember what the fuck is wrong
Then it hits me again my love is gone
You know im hustling in this bitch
I want some cheese and Ritz
I'm gonna bleach and rinse you out of all my memories
You know im hustling in this bitch
I'm hustling to forget
Your new boyfriend's a punk
He works at the T-Mobile kiosk
Ha, put a ring on it?
You got me so twisted imma pee vomit
Hell no I don't need a rescue
Must I remind you girlfriend I left you
I thought stalkers were only found in the horror movies with creeper sounds
Until this morning when i looked outside
And saw you standing there with a freakish frown
What the hell is wrong with you?
I think you need a talking to
Fuck it imma get a cop or two
And then I'm gonna snitch to your mom on you
Don't treat this as flattery
You text message me so many times that you ran down my battery
And honestly i think you might be the only person in the history of cellphones to pull that off
Listening to my favorite song
With the curtains closed till the day is gone
The Sun's outside and the rain is warm
Ain't no radio they'll play me on
Listening to my favorite song
Don't remember what drugs im on
Don't remember what the fuck is wrong
Then it hits me again my love is gone
Heyyo heyyo I'm hustling they can't stop me
Heyyo heyyo got vodka in my coffee
Heyyo heyyo I'm hustling they can't stop me
Heyyo heyyo got vodka in my coffee
