(INTRO)
"Are you absolutely sure she was in love with you?"
"Mmmhm. Why?"
"If you both take this potion, and you are in love with her but she never really was in love with you, you will love her for the rest of your life. And she will hate you for the rest of yours."
(END INTRO)

(TALKING OVER BEATS)
Come on
Man, I got this new girl that I like, heh, I fucked up. I pissed her off today
Um, you know what though? Let's be in a good mood today. Let's, let's let's go happy with this one
Shit

OK-
Ease back the trigger, talks too much and it never listens
I build a house from all the novels that you read in prison
I got a bottle full of bud heavy
I'm bunk bedding with the betty hearing problems 'til there's blood shedding
I toss some pizza in the oven for the piece of me that's buggin'
And the women that are trying to make me Jesus for a husband
But leisurely I'm single 'til I'm capturing your psyche
I'm passionate; your daddy wouldn't like me
I'm 5'9" and fourty-nine fiftiths
Snort a line borderline hippie-flip
Shoot needles porcupine hissie-fits
From my misery and lit flames
Kissin' in my '66 kittie with the bent frames
Suckin' down a camel light
I poke holes in an empty can of Sprite
'til I make a quick and handy pipe
And I can smoke all my problems like drugs
Here's a list of things that I love:
I love Twix bars, credit cards
New socks, rainy days
Cold beer, shootin' pool, 2Pac tapes;
I love little kids, givin' hugs, ladybugs
Tarantino films, Amelie, and The Boondock Saints
Readin' magazines backwards, wrinkle-free trousers
Takin' percocet and masturbatin' in the shower;
I love my independence, my family, my life
And everyone that came here tonight

Throw your souls up!

(CHORUS)
This little life of mine is turning pretty crazy
So I'm gonna dig into it 'til the harmony just let's me go;
I'm walkin' on nails witcha
Walkin' on nails witcha
Walkin' on nails 'til the sun don't show
This little life of mine is turning pretty crazy
So I'm gonna dig into it 'til the harmony just let's me go; (uh huh)
I'm walkin' on nails witcha
Walkin' on nails witcha
Walkin' on nails 'til the sun don't show

(END CHORUS)
I read the suicide letter of Hunter S. Thompson
I gotta say I was inspired by it
My life is kinda it;
I'm gettin' bored of takin' everything so seriously
Things are getting crazy now and quite defiant
Out the cake hole, screamin' "How'd your day go,"
Clouds and halos, couch potatoes
Crowds of girls with bouncy J.Los, (wooo)
You hound the payroll, you're helping me destroy myself now
Count the pesos
Cuz I should be a vegetarian - I know I should
But double-decker taco supremes are so good
Junior bacon cheeseburger rude awakenings further
This is for the people that still party when they're broke
This is for the people that find happiness in love
And this is for the independent rest of us that don't, like Earl
He joined the yacht club
Hurled from poison chopped drugs
Surly noisy rock stud with boys and girls in hot tubs
His cocky ass hit me in the face
So I wrote him down a list of things I hate:
I hate Larry the Cable Guy, the way cucumbers taste
People actin' tough and girls that invade my space
I hate bill collectors, I hate bad news
And people askin' me to talk about my tattoos;
I hate the person sittin' in your car talkin' shit about my songs
Don't fight the urge, sing along
I hate my songs
I hate Mac Lethal
I, hate, people

Take me home

(CHORUS)
This little life of mine is turning pretty crazy
So I'm gonna dig into it 'til the harmony just let's me go;
I'm walkin' on nails witcha
Walkin' on nails witcha
Walkin' on nails 'til the sun don't show
This little life of mine is turning pretty crazy
So I'm gonna dig into it 'til the harmony just let's me go;
I'm walkin' on nails witcha
Walkin' on nails witcha
Walkin' on nails 'til the sun don't show

(END CHORUS)
