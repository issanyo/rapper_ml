[Verse 1: Mac Lethal]
God Dammit I-I think I’m ‘bout to lose it
That is not an AK-47 that you’re hearing that’s my music
Popping and bussing I’ll leave you flopping and cussing
Quit rap, stick to mopping and dusting
Imma fucking leave you chained to the ceiling at the top of my dungeon
Oh it hurts? Better heal it with the drop of the ‘tussin
Imma flow flip, on that Holly Holm shit
Hit you with the dome kick
‘Bout to detonate, hear the slow tick!
When you can tell the world that I don’t exist
Ain’t that the motherfucking devil’s oldest trick
Well you can tell the motherfucking devil
Imma grab her by the hair so I can fuck her with a golden dick
Top new story on channel ten
Mac Lethal is an alien it’s not mammal skin
I’m never gonna quit drinking liquor like Josh Hamilton
Killing shit ‘till Kansas City legalizes cannabis

[Hook:Mac Lethal]
Motherfuckers better hope that I don’t snap
Don’t push me, don’t push me
You motherfuckers better hope that I don’t snap
Don’t push me

[Verse:2 Mac Lethal]
I’m drinking up all your blood and saying damn
It’s time you understand
I’m Jesus plus Adam plus Arnold in the 1970’s but I’m the man
The motherfucking man
Wolverine claws straight up sliding down my hands
I’ll creep up on you like a Bengal tiger in the sand
Always under pressure like MacGyver with a plan
Always got a semi-automatic weapon and a ’97 rooster
Walk up on the stage like a 9-11 truth-er
Quit hating bitch, embrace me
Meditating in a freezing cold river like I’m Hickson Gracie
Staring at myself butt naked in the mirror, just so I can see myself clearer
Whoo, you looking good Mac
You got them good raps
All I wanna say is yes
I take my hand and I put it on my chest
Right over my heart, Asian pussy is the best

[Hook: Mac Lethal]
But, you motherfuckers better hope that I don’t snap
Don’t push me, don’t push me
You motherfuckers better hope that I don’t snap, Barrel Maker, Mac Lethal blah
