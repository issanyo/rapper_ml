[Intro: Mac Lethal]
(Mac Lethal)
(and Justin Rent)
(BABY)

[Verse 1: Mac Lethal]
I kicked a hole into the earth's bottom and I drained the ocean
Strangle angels 'till the chain is broken
Danger strokin'
It's a cautionary tale
Walkin' on the pale moon
Fosterin' the frail
Inhale the dust
You fake middlemen
Nowadays rappers dress like
Kate Middleton
On their skin-white heads like
Anderson Cooper
Buyin' cigarettes from
Mander and Booster's on the corner
Gonna beat 'em with my fist
They're too cool for school
So they're easy to dismiss
I'm the teacher and I'm bliss
With a big sick smile
These are your albums
A dick-shit pile
Gross, are from the septic tank
I felt gratified when I left the bank
So I turned back around and I went through it all
Went the mall and I just blew it all
I can't handle a life without problems
Dismantle kids I'm a psycho-mouthed goblin
My name is Mac Lethal, Rent white politicians said they
Hate the black people cent
And that's me
That's' cruel
We the coolest kids of that school
If you wanna play me for a fool
Take a towel to your girl's mouth dry off the drool
That's me
That's cruel
I'm Chris Hansen
Please grab a stool
If you wanna play me for a fool
Do a 720 mil and grab a land in the pool
Commander the cool
Luke with the sick hand
Get drunk stumble then pull down my kickstand
I have a lotta chick fans
So I take 'em to Justin's house and get shit-canned
This ain't Ashes To Ashley
Or ashes to Asher Roth
It's glasses of apricots
And magical acid dots
Makin' life look like a broken Magnavox

[Hook: Sam Anderson]
Why won't they put us on the radio?
Turn up when they hear me in the stereo
Money, women on the dude in the video
But I ain't like that so now we know
Why won't they put us on the radio?
Turn up when they hear me in the stereo
Money, women on the dude in the video
But I ain't like that so now we know

[Verse 2: Sam Anderson]
Hello Mac, hello Justin
Better adjust it
Turn the dials up
We get to bustin'
On the track or somethin'
'Till we get up on a plaque and dust it
Brush the wax off with nothin'
But a breath out the mouth of a bastard munchkin
Comin' around the beat in a flaccid pumpkin that somethin'
No caution tape
Caution the fakes 'for they try to get up in my face so
Ties in my peso
Gotta try and coconut out my pasio for the bankroll seem shada badda pashio
If it pays me
I don't really give a fuck
It don't phase me
You crazy?
Lately, I've been a bit lazy
Wonderin' what I woulda been
Nothin' motivates me
So I get up on the microphone
And make a baby
To save me and praise me
But I forgot I was goin' crazy (yo)
I might seem a little messed up
When I get dressed up
And stretch up
To 'fess up
To shit that I did
Less of what I said I did
Better get a sedative
But I ain't gonna let it affect me
So take it like a man
When I kick you in the balls
And I hit you with a pad
In my head, I'm a little bit crazy with the mic stand
Yes your raps are too bland
So take it like a man
You a little bit off dude?
Please grab a stand
If you wanna try to hit me then you can
I demand that you only set a time in advance

[Hook: Sam Anderson]
Why won't they put us on the radio?
Turn up when they hear me in the stereo
Money, women on the dude in the video
But I ain't like that so now we know
Why won't they put us on the radio?
Turn up when they hear me in the stereo
Money, women on the dude in the video
But I ain't like that so now we know

[Verse 3: Justin Rent]
J. Rent fucker imma sick SOB
So wall white
Might wanna check the meth-od
Impress obese skeet
Slap with the balls out
I would give a fuck but I'm all out
Bitch, you just made fine
Bet you can't catch fish with a fake line
It's playtime
Work it was long
I'm fuckin' with the beat
Give birth to a song
It's perfectly raw shit
It's hurtin' the jaw quick
Can't escape
Animated the curtain was drawn, bitch
Hittin' chickens
I'm lickin' the bird softer
Dick in the turds girl
Lickin the germs off I'm
Quick-witted when I'm kickin' the jam
Crap on my audience
Shits hittin' the fan
Get it, man?
If not then don't bother
Makin the track high sauce don't poster/pasta
If I lost ya
Better go and rewind
Three times
Drop the beat
I'm real when I speak mind
I'm a man with a sick flow
Syphilis comin' out my dickhole when I spit bro
