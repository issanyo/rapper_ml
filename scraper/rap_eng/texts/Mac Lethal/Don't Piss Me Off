[Bridge x2: Mac Lethal]
Fuck a major record label
Stab the CEO's hand to the table
Fuck a major record label
Stab the A&R's hand to the table

[Hook: Chamillionaire & *Mac Lethal*]
You see the truth is
I lose my cool quick
Don’t make me lose it
You’ll see what lewd is
You see the truth is
I’m not like you kid
So don’t be foolish
I just might prove it
Just try not to piss me off
*You should tell them not to piss me off*
*Because I’ll turn them into history y’all* (Don’t piss me off)
*So please, just please don’t piss me off* (Don’t piss me off)
*You should tell them not to piss me off*
*Because I’ll turn them into history y’all* (Don’t piss me off)
*So please, just please don’t piss me off* (Don’t piss me off)

Chamillionaire, go

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
I was calm for a minute, yeah I started off calm
Til I saw a fake rapper with an Audemars on
Then I realized with my seeing eyes it was same man
That did came in with the Audemars on
Didn’t really think that we would audit y’all, huh?
Cause it seemed that you really got you balling on wrong
Whole bunch of jewelers that I oughtta call on
Just to show them that you’re faker than Mardi Gras charm
Can’t stand y’all, I’m loving every thought of y’all gone
I can read the future like it’s written on your palm
One hand on my cellie while I’m calling your mom
Got your sis strip teasing in a falling off thong
Pick them up, take them with me in the car to your prom
They know my money longer than a Ramadan song
But I ain’t trying to hit
I’m just trying to hit your face on your car while you got your car alarm on
See how many rappers I can get to retire
If you spit, I’m just hoping that you slip on saliva
Turn a Coke can with a kickstand to a time bomb
Give it to you then I disappear like McGyver
There will be no survivors
There will be no reminders
Got a cannon but I bet you never seeing Mariah
Give a second and I bet you’re going to see them on fire
When you see that you’re going to see that these other rappers is liars
See my Mac is lethal, plus Mac is lethal
Turn you into macaroni when we blasting people
See they’re actors, they got me yelling “Action people!”
Dig them up kill them again just like an action sequel
Everybody sound the same but it's just overkill
Put a hole in your chest see what your soul reveal
Got a rusty Black and Decker, call it Woody Woodpecker
Then I vrrmmmm in your heart so you can know the drill

[Hook: Chamillionaire & *Mac Lethal*]
You see the truth is

I was calm for a minute, but I started off angry
And didn’t kill everybody, thank me
I’m the only human being in the fucking world that got rabies
Digging up your garden, shitting in your daisies (Woof)
Put some candy in my bowl
I’m always trying to run away from animal control
I’m a ghost, I’m a ghoul, I’m a demon, I’m a rogue
I’m a screaming little toad, I’m a phantom with no soul
Goddamnit I’ll kill you, and even if you kill me
They're gonna think I let you like I’m Anderson Silva
Man fuck all the radio bullshit
Fuck anything that’s watered down like American pilsner
Now Mac Lethal, man, what the fuck is wrong with him?
Even Tech N9ne won’t do a song with him
If a rapper got a girl, man, she going to quit him
I’ll stretch him out until his epidermis don’t fit him (ah)
I give fuck about a bitch being trill
She can give brain in the kitchen like Richie Aprile
Drink wine in a warm red glass
Spitting game to a dame with a fine little corn-fed ass
Like Mike Tyson I beat it up until she couldn’t walk
Told if she isn’t trying to fornicate she shouldn’t talk (Uh)
I never spoil her
I just tell her all the Breaking Bad spoilers
Fuck all the mockery you’re making
Every single tooth, every bone every fossil I’m breaking
Mac Lethal got the fucking soccer moms shaking
Like they popping and they breaking
Saying “As-salamu alaykum”
Everybody sounds the same and it’s just overkill
In fact, most rap groups sound like Soul for Real
If you don’t want to get your soldiers killed
You better throw your shield
And head over hills
You know the drill

[Hook]

[Mac Lethal]
