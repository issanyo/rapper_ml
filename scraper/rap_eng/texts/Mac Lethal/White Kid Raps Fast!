[Intro]
Happy birthday, Duriel
From me and Lauren
My name is Mac Lethal
But I'm gonna spit some paler and faster fucking lyrics

[Verse]
Oh hi! My name's Mac
Ecstasy, cocaine and crack
None of that I just smoke green
While Chinese people eat your cat
Roll by on a low-ride Huffy
Simpsons on and my beer is Duff see
Cuff rolled up to my calf
Cash out the ass cuz I wrote a couple raps for Puffy
Gotta be the one to bite the bullet I'm a sinner
But I bet I could have been a better man
I wanna be Zen but I go sipping on some medicine
Instead of meditating but I get it when I can
I don’t wanna wind up in the gutter with a bottle of malt liquor bitter cuz I never got a call
But who the fuck drinks malt liquor anymore?
Gimme vodka now and start sucking on my balls!
Motherfuckers wanna have another personal epiphany
I’m coming with a symphony eliminating
Everybody/anybody roll up like a cannibal
And bite em like a peanut butter apple in a minute
I’mma nibble on a pentagram and every single bitter lamb
Is getting so offended I don’t give a damn if anything
A mental plan is coming with a visually integrated
Entity and everybody’s gonna get the guillotine
I’m getting cinematic in a matter of a minute
Every milligram is devilish the Vatican will kill it dead
Gonna kill it 'til it’s dead
I’mma try to get em in the head, corn-fed
Midwestern whore bred
She looks so thick and juicy give it to me in the booty shorts
Then you gotta get up in the morn and get out!
Let's speed it up, big breath!
Never been a counterfeit of nothing I am just an elevated
Entity I’m coming and giving it back and then pumping
Dump on every instrument with increments of sentiments
And syllables I lunge I’m livid again I’m sticking it in their muffins
Make a couple million I’m hoping to I’m going to
So gimme another reason I should sit around and not experience
Benefits of getting down when all the drivel that they’re spitting
Is so hideous Godzilla fear the viciousness
Fear the viciousness

[Outro]
I love gay babies dude
I just think I like dogs more than cats
Happy birthday, Duriel
Had to fucking hurt my lungs
Chocolate rain
Chocolate rain
