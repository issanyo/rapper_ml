Verse 1
My Utopian society is schoolyard fights between the crypt keeper and the grip reaper
I'm Aurora Borealis in a painting
I picture you repetitive as fuck like Tessellation
Martian the most nefarious ancient graveyard
I took a butterfly net in space and caught a quasar
I rode the Pegasus blindfolded to the edge of the ravine
Where it just so happened to lose it's wings
The alien light beam of radiant light
Disbar on cracked skulls and scimitars Arabian nights
My army's a million yellow eyed snow angels
With cross-eyed aim to blow facials
Death move rappers get replaced up incomplete
And wanna come to Kansas like Stacy and ???
I serve self lobotomizing dim sum
I'm on the block and they are on the porch like ???

Verse 2
I'm the sul-tan member of MUFON
While internet rappers and women dressed in soldier suits like Mulan
It's just a morbid portion of what your absorbing
I'm giving all you warriors warning like the orphan
Burned off my skin because white people can't rhyme
Now I can fuck the world and implant land mines
I got a big ole mouth like Cane Corsos
You all confused asking who deliver like DiGirno
Dogma black tongue wingspan of Mothra
Toxic pro-lyrics war games Contra
And I got tunnel vision to start stuffing kids like having a body in a bed near construction

Verse 3
I wear the gas mask of Kabal, to swim in gastric juices and tag my name on stomach walls
I make meals with the simplest ingredients while obscure kids turn the rocks like Prometheus
Silhouette sepaloid disperse, on Neptune to slingshot asteroids at Earth
My thoughts combust and grow elephant tusks, throw your brain at the wall and make it stick like suction cups
My halo effect is the ???
Shotgun smoke the devil through an icy retrospect
Grave form syndicated sand scribe workshop
Physique is just right I'm above eyes like dust mites
I drop monolithic records with twelve foot Aztec calendar stones for headphones
I'm Orion with a blood hound I'll hunt each star
Turn the world upside down and use the train tracks as monkey bars

It's Mac Lethal and cool DJ Cerebral
It's Mac Lethal and cool DJ Cerebral
It's Mac Lethal and cool DJ Cerebral
It's Mac Lethal and cool DJ Cerebral
March!

Left, Right...
