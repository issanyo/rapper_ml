Hotel room demo

She got a slutty side that she shows to everyone
She got a tender heart that she gives to everyone
I mean, she falls in love with everyone
Because every time she sleeps with her man, she don’t ever cum
I try to take her on a date, she don’t ever come
She married young, she’d rather be a tease
So I fulfill her needs every Sunday
She tells me that she’s gonna go see a therapist
One day
Yellow stain moon, dilated pupils
And a vicious little swoon, romance in June
Maroon sash, our hotel room smells like cigarette ash and a perfume flash
Heart shaped glass, table cloth velvet, full of gin and tonic with the ice cubes melted
Room service brought it, and she put it to her lips
Said it tasted too strong and only took a couple sips but
She says she loves him but he’s full of so much drama
If she ever up and left him, she would crush him
He thinks she’ll stay until the world ends
He also thinks she’s staying with a girlfriend tonight but no..


She got a slutty side that she shows to everyone
She got a tender heart that she gives to everyone
I mean, she falls in love with everyone
Because every time she sleeps with her man, she don’t ever cum
And when he’s too drunk, he don’t ever come
And when they got problems, he tells everyone
About how she wrongs him and fucks him over
She doesn’t even like to fuck him sober because

She got a slutty side that she shows to everyone
She got a tender heart that she gives to everyone
I mean, she falls in love with everyone
Because every time she sleeps with her man, she don’t ever cum
I try to take her on vacation but she won’t come
She don’t want a conversation, just a slow tongue
I hug her and I hold hands
She don’t give a damn about me
She just loves it that I fuck her like a grown man
They've grown apart. I've grown attached
Gasoline doused, walk away, throw a match, BOOM!
She wants to juggle us with both hands
See, I don’t cuddle, I don’t slow dance
I take a half moon, yellow like cautious, pin point pupils
And a vicious little saga, romance in August
Remorse and guilt couldn't stop us
She tried to cut his ass off because she’s allergic to the saw dust
He says he loves her so much that
If he ever caught her cheat on him, he would have to crush her And he would kill the man she did it with

Wait
I think the story needs a little twist
When they found me dead
In my pants pocket was a hotel matchbook with her number written on it
A couple hundred dollars in my patent leather wallet
Two ticket stubs to a Sadé concert
See

And at that show, I was kissing her ear lobe
Standing in the front row
And suddenly I saw through her slutty side
And I asked her if she would let me come inside
And she said, “Why the fucking you ruining this for?
Once upon a time, I was your stupid little whore.”
She just turned cold, it was brutal, it was war
She told me she couldn't do this anymore
And I realized

She got a slutty side that she shows to everyone
She got a tender heart that she gives to everyone
I mean, she falls in love with everyone
But if you ever get attached
Don’t make her feel forever young
She’s gonna bolt, gonna walk, you’re forever done
You’re gonna feel the sharp pain in your head and lungs
She’s gonna crush your little fucking pride
And find someone else to show her slutty side to

You get it
