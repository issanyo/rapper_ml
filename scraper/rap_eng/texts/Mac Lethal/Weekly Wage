I said a weekly wage is an addiction
It's so much worse than any drug
You're a slave to security and comfort
So you never pursue the things you love (2X)

You got a job that you hate
And every day you want to punch your fuckin' boss in the face
Direction lost and it's late
There is a master piece inside of you that you gotta create
But you whisper every time you're talking to fate
See if you quit your job you won't have money (true)
But one thing you will be is hungry (true)
And you always turn creative and savage as fuck
When your life is hard and you ain't comfy
See if you quit your job you won't have benefits (true)
But one thing you will have is fitness (true)
To innovate and learn and get a real work ethic
So you can start your own damn business

I mean what
You want an easy answer
You want someone to pat you on the  head and tell you it will be okay
You got the fucking nerve to wonder why you're so depressed
When you're sitting in a cubicle like 10 hours a day
Working for a company that you don't really care about
Helping build someone else's kingdom (true)
That's a motherfucking consequence of putting finances
Over true happiness and freedom

Now listen to me
If you got a job and you love it then you should keep it
But if you get a knot in your stomach after the weekend
'Cause you don't like mondays 'cause you'll be in an office all week not getting sun rays
You feel like inside of you
Deep inside of you
There's an artist with an attitude
Then listen to me
This is what you gotta do
You gotta stop being a fucking corporate prostitute
That is what you are my friend, I'm telling you the honest truth
I understand my friend you gotta pay your bills and all
So thinking about just walking out your job is no easy pill to swallow
Plus what happens if you try to start your own company and it fails
Oh my god what if you fail
Well failure is a teacher that will tear your ACL
During the first game of the season
With your parents in the bleachers
And failure is the teacher that has helped 100,000 lost sailors find the beaches
Find the beaches

You only get to live once
One..... time

You only get to live once
Make the most of it
Don't let money beat you to the point where you don't even enjoy your life

Live in your car
