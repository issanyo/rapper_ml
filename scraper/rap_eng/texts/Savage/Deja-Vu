You get them flashback visions
Little glimpse of your past life
In a room full of people
Mic stand and a limelight
It's that deja-vu
When you're living your dreams
'Cos you can check in anytime
But it don't mean you can leave

Deja-vu
It's like you've been there before
That creepy feeling that you just can't ignore
Deja-vu
It's like you've been there before
That creepy feeling that you just can't ignore

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
But if I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
But if I die before I wake
(OMG!)

Deja-vu
It's like you've been there before
Ahhh Sh*t they unleashed the beast
Samoan freak with a Jesus Piece
Big Motherf*cker with a need for speed
And this is all me I don't have degrees
No Plan B to fall back on
No rich parents to ask from
But all I need to make sh*t happen
Is a microphone and this platform

Deja-vu
It's like you've been there before (been there before)
That creepy feeling that you just can't ignore
Deja-vu
It's like you've been there before (been there before)
That creepy feeling that you just can't ignore

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
But if I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
But if I die before I wake
(OMG!)

Deja-vu
It's like you've been there before
That creepy feeling that you just can't ignore
Deja-vu
It's like you've been there before
That creepy feeling that you just can't ignore
Deja-vu
It's like you've been there before
Deja-vu
It's like you've been there before
Deja-vu
It's like you've been there before
Deja-vu
It's like you've been there before
