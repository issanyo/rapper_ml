[Intro]
Yeaaaaaah!
Spooky spooky
Spoo, spoo, spooky
HA Ha HAA!
Spooky, yeah spooky
Spooky spooky
SPOOKY!

[Verse 1]
I wanna be myself I am not a pretender
Any negativity and I’ll return the sender
That means I’ll chew your hate and spit it back like a blender
I’m the goalie and the striker all my friends are my defenders
Most guys my age are double tapping pics of Kylie Jenner
But my mission ain’t even the opposite gender
Now don’t get me wrong girls at my school do look good
But don’t ask for my top five I’ll be under my hood

Just take a look at everything I’ve ever created
Some say It’s trash some say my style is outdated
Then we have the people that say that I’m underrated
At first I take it but then I start debating
Whether they mean it or not
Mind is heavy full of thoughts
And I’m not talking ‘bout those girls
Your minds are extra twisted like a twirl
They tell me stop before I end up like Jerry
And I’m not talking ‘bout a curl
You make me sick I’ma hurl, yeah hey

[Hook 2x]
As I'm looking up I see the sky is looking gloomy
Throwing shots they ducking like Hoowie Doowie Louie
Just went trick or treating getting snacks like Scooby
It ain't a horror movie but it's getting kinda spooky

[Refrain]
Spooky, spooky
Spooky
Yeah spooky
Yeah spooky
Spooky spooky
AHHH!

[Verse 2]
I'm grim like a reaper
I could blow up like a creeper
I got goals like a keeper
But I'm an outfielder
Unlike Moses I'm not really a leader
But I could really be a snitch
A snitch? no seeker
Every time I do something it feels like a show
But I do not know of you could keep with the flow
I use what I got that's how I think on my toes
The light can stay red but I'm still gonna go

Your girl be extra freaky like she really wanna meet me
She must really want some candy she goin’ blow up like a creeper
Knocked on my door when she went trick or treating
One thing lead to another and then I started to meat her

We stay lit like a jackolantern
Hotter than the hottest summer
Kanye West ain't got the answers
I’m not talking bout Tanner
Like a fox I have Will
Ignore DeStorm cause I'm the one with power
I don't rock the rolly but I'm man of the hour, yeah

[Hook 2x]
As I'm looking up I see the sky is looking gloomy
Throwing shots they ducking like Hoowie Doowie Louie
Just went trick or treating getting snacks like Scooby
It ain't a horror movie but it's getting kinda spooky
