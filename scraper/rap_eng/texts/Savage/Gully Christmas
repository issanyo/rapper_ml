[Verse 1: Flexx]
Santa nah come a Gullyside, me a go a Norbrook
Push the 'K inna him neck when time him nah look
Take the money and the food 'cause mama waan cook
And mi daughter say she want a coloring book
Me never see Santa Clause 'round a Baktu

Mi high-jack the sleigh up a Cherry Garden
Step out Christmas towards the ghetto garrison

You see Santa scare
With him red nose reindeer
See mi long rifle with the red light here
Shot it inna the square, Santa Clause get tear!

And no toys come out deh when this buss
