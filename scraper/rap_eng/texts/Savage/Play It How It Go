I’m knee deep up in the streets, popping g’s up in these streets
Straight for keeps, if you don’t work then you don’t eat up in these streets
You got wisdom and you clutching, you succeed up in these streets
But if you timid and you pussy, you gonn bleed up in these streets
How you build, how you ride, once you make us friend of mine
G shit, how nigga live, really slaying out
Free shit, niggas ain’t gonna give, if you ain’t designer
Get it on your own and I’ll be damned if niggas claiming mine
Bust your bust pipe to make the bitch nigga come out
Set your book and getting question, make the snitch nigga come out
Just be cool and call your lawyer, that’s how rich niggas come out
And if it’s big we on the streets, we hoping wish niggas come out
Got my g code from the og’s, on the south side, I grew up
I’m screwed up, tattoed up, I’m tuned up
...nigga not me, I play it how it go
Niggas play a lot of games but you can’t play me like no ho 1 hunna

[Hook] x 2
How you nigga really feeling, talking gangsta shit
Done got a lot of niggas killed
If you talking how you singing, nigga I ain’t know
Talking like you thinking, nigga play it how it go, how it go

Verse 2 for all you coward niggas, perpetrating like you thugged, I call em sour niggas
You ain’t go like that, you flip like that
Get your chest filled with a mac
Get your head bust to the fed
Fucking round with little hatchet ain’t a game
I’m in no game, I’m in the army nigga
Fuck you haters chain with the choppa, that’s a warning nigga
I got that thug in my blood, I’m a veteran
The principal of my school, I expel you man
Project baby, southside baby, whatever you wanna call it
And jesus set you up, my uncles out to hold it
Niggas with no love, I can pay you selling drugs
Love getting money, if you don’t love then you a scrub
Where the love, it ain’t no love in these streets I was raised in
They give a 5 to 10, turn a nigga to cave men
Fake friends, don't get no love, they get bullets
I’ve been a hood bullet, been D-Boin' you pussies nigga!

[Hook] x 2
How you nigga really feeling, talking gangsta shit
Done got a lot of niggas killed
If you talking how you singing, nigga I ain’t know
Talking like you thinking, nigga play it how it go, how it go

I swear to god these niggas frauds, I can’t stand you pussies
Spend the bind and let off 10, fill his chest out with bullets
This nigga johhny concrete when he 20 to 30 deep
Catch that coward by itself, I bet he run while you speak
Wailing and holling they silent whole time you a liquor
These niggas raiding out here...
Boy you don’t live like this
You ain’t built like that
Throwing bricks and hide your hand
Will get your brain pushed back
You draw ...on these phones, thinking that will get you on
That shit there will get you gone, exterminate the whole home
I fuck with maggots and they hungry, they eat brains for breakfast
Crash dummy niggas balling, pin your ass to the stretcher
Wake up to guns on the dresser, I really live this life
Far hop a blunt of that pressure and keep my still at night
You better hope the guard you diving for you catch you charge
I just...waiting with a tong for you boy, pussy!
