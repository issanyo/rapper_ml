Yo, this be Cardboard Box
I be better than Batman
This be a Boatmen diss track bros
Let’s do this
You Boatmen suck, us boxes rule
Cuz unlike you, us boxes aren’t useless fools
Just I am cooler than all of you combined
And you guys can’t understand the postulate of 229
Us boxes help execute our master’s evil plan
You Boatmen only like to spam
All you Boatmen say is, “Go fakyu ursalf,”
And you guys cause more havoc than Wreck-It Ralph
I live in an amazing secret base
But you live in a horrible place
And we have a gigantic army
But there are only two of you to fight me
Us boxes have IQs of 229
And genies have IQs of undefined
But it’s much, much worse for you Boatmen
Cuz your IQs be undefined times NaN
You Boatmen think saying "Go fakyu" is nice
How about you say that to your future wives
Oh wait you don't have any cuz nobody likes you
So go dive into a toilet filled with poo
You guys think you’re better than us, but you’re really not
Cuz unlike you, we don’t try to insult others a lot
You guys keep saying “Go fakyu” and “Your aikyu gay.”
Even though those are very mean things to say
Plus, that's not even how you properly insult people
And you also hack others’ accounts which is illegal
You think the world's a triangular prism and Texas is a planet
But they're actually cardboard boxes, why don't you know that, dang it
You Boatmen argue amongst each other
Us boxes are united and we help one another
You think you Boatmen are so great but you're not
Cuz you can't hack others without being caught
Our army will wipe you Boatmen down
Yeah we gonna kick you Boatmen out of town
We're gonna take over the Earth eventually
And you Boatmen will be dead for eternity
