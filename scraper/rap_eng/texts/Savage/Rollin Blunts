Would tell a secret but you'll prolly miss it
Or misinterpret -bend the facts to your worth-
That sh*t can't converse with
I'm just too busy chartin' the stars
For you it's Adam Eve
For me it's chakras and auras
I'll hold that story...Don't depart it
Pre to the lude I ain't even start yet
And I bet you sweatin bullets
You foolish- an easy target
I just keep it going keep it recording a simple motion
Some people false in morals
Oppressed so my mind deports them
As I paint this portrait
Through the truth I can see the lies
It's like their own accordance
Most are a program, I'm not remotive
Listen closely..Hate is through Sin and history's bogus
Now I rap to expose them
Shorter talk is something I don't get
Learn to conduct your thinking my n*gga
I thought I told you
