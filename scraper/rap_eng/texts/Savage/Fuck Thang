Girl, you know this was a fuck thang
So why you keep blowin' up my phone?
Tryin' to call me while I'm at home
If my girl found out it is on
Girl, you know this was a fuck thang
I didn't know this was gonna be like this
I should have never gave you this dick
I guess a nikkah wasn't on that shit
Now you fallin' all in love, babe

[Verse 1](B.G.)
Now you knew this from jump street
I had a number 1 and I had a lot of freaks
You had an ol' man and a side piece
So while the deal was to do this twice a week
Yeah, you was feelin' me and I was diggin' you
Should have knew what that hot boy would do to you
I thought you was G'd up but I guess I was wrong though
You waited 15 playin' on the phone hoe
This how the game go, this how the game been
Since I was in my teen
This how the game is but you gonna learn, babe
You live another day, all you got to do
Is just listen to what a thug say

[Verse 2](B.G.)

Tellin' me my main bitch be braggin' on her main dick
Knowing how these hoes is, she was on some lame shit
She seemed real stupid, I wanna taste too
I said, "Taste who?" She said, "Taste you"
I asked her if she could keep a secret, she said all day
Next morning, bitch got us all over myspace
Now she tweetin' 'bout it all on facebook
But ain't tellin' when I nutted how hoe face looks
But you gonna learn, babe, you live another day
All you got to do is just listen to what a thug say

[Verse 3](B.G.)
I go a lot of places, I do a lot of shows
I got a lot of fans and I fuck a lot of hoes
I make you feel like my ol' lady when I'm in' town
Just follow me after the show, babe, its goin' down
You say your girl wanted me since I was a young
Nikkah, you say your man wanna be me
But he a fuck nikkah and I'm a one of a kind type G
His swag, his style ain't nothin' like me
I'm a boss, he a worker, I'm a man, he a boi
He do a lot of talkin' but I bring a lot of noise
I might fly you to New Orleans next month, 1st class
I like you, babe 'cause girl, you know where it stands
