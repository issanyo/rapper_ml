[Intro]
Open up
Let the devil out
And you already know what this is about
Hahaha

[Verse 1]
Yeah, light the fuse
Your graves waiting for you
After this you'll be blue
Ain’t no telling what I'm gon' do
Haha, I’m pumped up
Don't need no backup
No buildup
Only needed a breakup
Perhaps next time you should start wearing makeup
You act up
Buckle up
Time to charge up

Yeah, time to put you down
Fuckin' clown
I'm boutta make you drown
Please don't turn that frown upside down

Yeah fuck the peace sign
This track gon' be fine
I will shine

Put you in the scope
You got too many insecurities to cope
There's no hope

Remember I helped you out?
And you backstabbed me...
Is that really what you're about?

Yeah I’m picking out all the lies
Got you in my eyes
I know you wanna see my demise
But instead we go back to the first song and I rise

Put yourself in my shoes
A whole life of abuse
And the funny part is there ain’t no excuse
Hol' up, hold up, let me defuse...

See what you did was fucked up
I ain’t ever been through a struggle that was that tough
And the funny part is you complain about it
But you basically asked for it
How about it?!

Yeah you fucked with the wrong dude
But luckily for you
I'll end this feud
Take this as more of a warning
Just next time don't give me attitude
