They tote macs in my city
Get polled if you holdin them racks in my city
You get clapped in my city
You hoop or you rap or you trap in my city
So don't lack in my city
Where shorty's tote thirties, they strapped in my city
You get wacked in my city
Make bands off of rap give it back to my city

[Verse 1: Savage]
Ain't no tucking no chains
They tucking them things they up it and bang
Try to rob me I promise im lettin' it spray
While you lay in your grave
My momma she told me watch who in your gang
Cuz' niggas will change
But my niggas my brothers
Won't change up for nothing
Can't wait for the come up
Shootin like katie no thunder
Pull up on a nigga no jumper
If I hit him I'm layin him under
I'm hot like the middle of summer
Got some youngins that shoot on the regular
Itchin' to kill like its eczema
If they see you its on
Shoot like Capone
Then go with the mop like a janitor
In my city it's colder than canada
People you love will abandon you
Don't call me I'm too busy ballin
They talking bout money
I'm not understanding you
? shooting that wheel
In my city they shootin to kill
Turn 50 dollars to a half ounce
Nigga watch what I do with a mil'

[Verse 2: J Real]
I just left the city
I just bought a semi, it came with a 50
Don't lack in my city
You'll only end up on a shirt in my city
I might come to your city
Take over your city, fly back to my city
I do this for sunny and ?
I can't forget ?
My shooters is with me, my gloves and my mask
Let's go handle our buisness
Once real get on fire I'm too hot for the stove
Get your ass out the kitchen
Bitch i'm the man, your bitch wanna fuck
Cuz she see all these bands
She blew me like trumpets, she'll be in the band
All on her knees like she bout to start praying
Got ? a lot
But I still walk around with that metal of honor
They'll be telling your mommna
Your son just got hit up
? let you play with the monsters
Unless you ready to ride ain't no eye for an eye
Everybody gon die once we coming
We coming ain't nowhere to hide
Can't wait for the day that they free all the guys
Knock at your door, what a suprise
Shooters with shooters dressed up in disguise
40's with 30's, five sevens and 9's
You done fucked up ? bitch it's your time
I can remember back up in 09
? for nickels and dimes
Now I get payed for these shows
When I'm off on the road
I Come back to my city and shine
Gang

[Verse 3: Savage]
MOB shit man

Ain't no love in my city
Just killers and guns in my city
Drug dealers and buyers, fuck niggas and liers
Who don't give a fuck in my city
Gorrillas and Lions who ? with that fire
We light your ass up in my city
If you lacking good luck in my city
You ain't from here don't come here
Get done in my city
My momma need a benz' and bigger house
So I left school and took a different route
But I got some niggas that ain't gettin out

Them real niggas from two different sides
Growing up here better pick a side
You will never catch me with no different guys
Bitch it's MOB until a nigga die
It's some snakes here, it's some fakes here
Gotta watch your back cuz niggas hate here
It's some real niggas gettin' cake here
And some people down to ? here
Everybody say that they ain't lacking here
But if somebody lying imma find out
You mention me, my killers ride out
Fuck that twitter beef, nigga sign out
