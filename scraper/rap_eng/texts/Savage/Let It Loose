We won’t need to intimidate you
If we get a major breakthrough
So come on – let it loose

You’ve all seen this all before
So come on, get up and off of the floor
Let’s go – let it loose

Oh yeah

We’re not here to read your rights
Tonight’s the night you do what you like
Hey you there – let it loose

If it’s much too loud, well, we don’t care
Are you ready – let it loose

Going crazy

We’ve the goods to appetise
Take it all, don’t compromise
Oh, Let it loose

Forget tomorrow, we’re here today
Is it what you want, are you here to stay
What do you say – let it loose
