(Verse 1) - Cookalicious

I'm 16 but i'm still lethal
I'm 16 but i look legal
Flyin high like a bald eagle
You tough online but now you fearful

Cash another check yuh
Louie v and designer tags
Diamonds on my neck yuh
Louie v and designer tags

(Hook) - Cookalicious

Butterfly door the DeLorean
Louie v and designer tags
Gold on my grill and my shirt is Ralph Lauren
Louie v and designer tags
The girls adorin’ the rari is foreign

Louie v and designer tags
Louie v and designer tags
Louie v and designer tags

Pop a cap get my bread yuh
Louie v and designer tags
Thumbtack in yo head yuh
Louie v and designer tags
Imma rap till im dead yuh
Louie v and designer tags
Louie v and designer tags
Louie v and designer tags

[Verse 2- Lucky]

Ice on my necklace
I’ve been restless
Cause my Diamonds reckless
Go and get yo check list
U can’t check this
I excel at flexing
Who u think u textin

Yo you crying like a baby
Got a new Mercedes
I got heat like I’m hades
Yea it so crazy
See her she my baby
I’ve been working hard
While y’all are looking lazy

(Bridge) - Cookalicous
You test me and you snitch
On yo block now you switch
Put yo body in the ditch
I was broke now we rich
I got shooters down in the west end
Took yo girl and I made her my best friend-
Rap school nonstop till this money test end

[Verse 3- Cookalicious]

I'm 16 but i'm still lethal
I'm 16 but i look legal
I'm stackin bills like a full seagull
You tough online but now you fearful

Cash another check yuh
Louie v and designer tags
Diamonds on my neck yuh
Louie v and designer tags

[Verse 4]

I dominate
I dodge the hate

All y'all rappers wanna-be
Keep it 100
I keep it 103
Think im defenseless
So they pull the gun on me
Y'all think im senseless
I got one on me
We gon countdown and run on three
We ain't gonna stop till the dawgs free
Diamonds make you stop make you freeze

Cookalicious is back
Vicious the mac
I run up a check
And count me a stack
I kill the beat
The way I attack
I throw me a party and invite Kodak
I ball on these haters just call me Shaq
I master my words while y'all fellas lack
I rap me some bars and collect my check
Spit in the studio and thats a wrap
