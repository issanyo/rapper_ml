[Chorus: Savage]
Yeah I push the limit (hey)
Yeah I'm pushing bass
Yeah I'm pushing these other suckers
Get up out my face
Yeah I'm pushing iron (hey)
Yeah I'm pushing weight
From the East side to the West side
Push it

[Hook]
Push, push, push, push it
Push, push, push, push it

[Verse 1: Far East Movement]
Throw down better fight back
I'm motherf*cking like Mike to the hype track
Mid air like a triple 7 hijack
Knocking down these shots a lineback
Itty bitty titty better hit the bench press
I'm pushing pussy so HAM make the bed wet
No sweat
Real bitches give head
Ahh yeah
Ass like that make a player break bread

[Chorus: Savage]
Yeah I push the limit (hey)
Yeah I'm pushing bass
Yeah I'm pushing these other suckers
Get up out my face
Yeah I'm pushing iron (hey)
Yeah I'm pushing weight
From the East side to the West side
Push it

[Hook]
Push, push, push, push it
Push, push, push, push it

[Verse 2: Far East Movement]
No room better move bitch
Two hand crew street fighter (hadouken)
I can push it all night
Make her lube it
Leave 'em naked on the porch like a nudist
Far East side hit ya with the big wang
No clowns, my posse go insane
Gold leash on my bitch, that's my pimp chain (mang)
Make ya head explode when my sh*t bang

Push it, push it

[Chorus: Savage]
Yeah I push the limit (hey)
Yeah I'm pushing bass
Yeah I'm pushing these other suckers
Get up out my face
Yeah I'm pushing iron (hey)
Yeah I'm pushing weight
From the East side to the West side

[Hook]
Push, push, push, push it
Push, push, push, push it

[Bridge: Savage]
Lose your mind
Punch your fist
Drop a, drop a couple molly's
Now lose your sh*t
(Repeat)

Push it, push it, push it ahh
Push it, push it, push it ahh
Push it, push it, push it ahh

[Chorus: Far East Movement]
Yeah I push the limit (hey)
Yeah I'm pushing bass
Yeah I'm pushing these other suckers
Get up out my face
Yeah I'm pushing iron (hey)
Yeah I'm pushing weight
From the East side to the West side
