When you find the light to an upset shade away
If you never, never let me go with every melody
And you often were at leaving just my life
If you're really not to tug and
Buy too many fantasy... me too

When you need to get another chance today
For a thunder is the past a path we are human being
Do you rather like to feel what is my life
If you're really going to listen baby
At my fantasy... and me

Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight
Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight

Just a random access memories of dreams
As you're hangin' upon me, do you love melody
Thief of golden toys to an upset time away
As we're human being at last we have the melody... we too

Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight
Don't let me go
Don't cry tonight
