[Guru]
I set if off, by letting you know that I can flow
To many beats, similar to fluid so freely
And you can say I'm gettin kind of greedy, but so what?
'Cause I'm supplying the needy
While some emcees go for therapy, I bury the
Remains of the others cause they suck incredibly
Superficial styles only last a little while
But they never hold a candle to the Gang Starr profile
More than just wit and more than just intellect
And more than a gangster cause I kill with a mic check
And I'm not the one with the H on his back meaning the Herb
I like the funky beats, I like the good herb
Most likely in a blunt as I roll it real steady
Then I get mentally ready
To play a track from the Heavies and mellow out
Cause my main objective is to be more effective

[Hook: repeat 4X]
It's gettin hectic, it's getting crazy
I'ts gettin hectic, it's getting wild

[Guru]
Yo when the mic stands free, I then step to the
Point of attack cause the track feels good to me
And I intend to break you out of your restraints
'Cause you gain interest in my lines like I'm CitiBank
And thanks to the Brand New Heavies and everyone
Who can dig the movement of the Guru, smooth and
Proving, that I'm the relevant eloquent one
Suckers gettin whoopings like they're all my sons
Remembering rap from the days of its origin
The power of many men ascends from my pen
Dissing the ones wit the fame and, claiming they hard
Yo them I disregard
Cause they ain't all cracked up to what they should be
Some I call wannabees, and some I call would-bes
And I'm gettin vexed by the crap they project
They put in on wax and on the record store racks

[Hook]

[Guru]
Rearranging the script as my words shift gear in a flash
Putting cash in a stash, ain't nuttin funny, money
Much greater gifts I receive, by those who are blessed
And me, I got a treasure chest
By all means protected at all times
You try to front and you'll pay more than a small fine
I don't brag, about the stuff I did
I simply roll correctly, demolishing stupid kids
And they're running off with the lip and not accomplishing zip
I tell 'em wake up son, 'cause this is it
Peep out the suckers who are faking
Flaking moves on the mic and in life
Strife is what I give 'em cause I'm living how I should be
And you better move cause the groove is like deadly
And no you ain't all that, and many ain't legit
So I'mma put 'em out, 'fore they get rushed

[Hook]

[Guru]
Yo, Gang Starr, 1991 into '92 and beyond
Lounging with the Brand New Heavies
DJ Premier and the Guru, Brooklyn, peace out
