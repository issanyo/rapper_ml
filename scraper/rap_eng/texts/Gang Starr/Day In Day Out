[Hook]
The life you is walking through
Such a bitch
Day in to day out the same old thing kid

[Verse 1 - Spek]
Bring me to the end and I'll be me
Open up your eyes wide so you can see
It's thick to be me
How I kick my rhymes down pat
Within the circle how we do
When we kick that fact
But where's the meaning?
I take it one night by one night
But where's the meaning?
I take it one day by every day
I pick a rhyme I chose and put it number one inside my placement
So look to find the signs inside my basement
No tears
Sell us full of samples with ample time to loop
It's just the beats from the dead from my head with my troop
And it be cool if all the time was like studio time
But days are long enough for Spek with the rest of my time
I think I'm manic depressive and not agressive enough
You can try to be hard but damn you still won't be rough
Life is whack for the ?? life is phat if you flow
Life is waitin' for a deal when you like got no dough

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Spek, Lu]
In the middle of my nights I check my late night flicks
I'm up at night trying to write and late night I get my kicks
That is I'm out to get my main feature
The low budget picture in my room and in between I write scriptures
Picture this the day's just a claender's notch
And every kid becomes the one who wanna ride it on the crotches
And when I'm finished when my flick is almost done
When my rhyme is half done
When I check a late re-run

I lose to the groove soul sounds soothe me well
Sometimes my mind wonders sometimes heaven could be hell
I pass the fools who has never known my name
When I think about the deal sometimes I need someone to blame
I add members to the show who knows a fan
For the ones that wanna capture the essence of level
To the hip-hop their directions they groke
Who's representing us? the critics holy smoke

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lu]
Place text in images replacing old versions
Documents displayed as homemade
Glue without a clue you your loophole is deckin' in the halls to ring bells
In fear of losing clientels
My work place is infinite
But can't plan it like my screens appearance is translusive
But with a hard ??? I display I cruhser critics
As easy as...
Skip this step if you wanna
Control key available to only keyboards you can't afford
Q he's the shift he's the roller
Can't understand your education is basic (science)
So many words and everything is being said
Yet people get pissed
When people wanna your way but not their way so which way's the right way
I'm going hungry in the belly of the beast
That uncleans the serpent
I walk like the lion I'm a leash

[Hook]
