[Hook]
"Money's growing like grass with the mass appeal"

[Verse 1]
No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
Their noses, I hate those motherfucking posers
But I'm so real, to them it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back
When I'm kicking real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

"Money's growing like grass with the mass appeal"

[Verse 2]
Oh yes, I'm greater than all MC's when I breeze
Give me room, please
I be like fascinating when I be updating
Cutting off wack kids, pulling their trump cards
I thump hard, and make 'em say that I'm God
Niggas be pretending they're hardcore
Never know the meaning of (raw)
But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
No double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
Cause suckers be like playing themselves to have mass appeal

[Verse 3]
I know I'm dope, but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks, but now I'm making greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks, I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore I'm calm
But wild, with my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Give me a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you it's tragic, I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya
Those who kick dirt, in due time I'm gonna get ya
Cause I be kicking the real
While they be losing the race trying to chase mass appeal
