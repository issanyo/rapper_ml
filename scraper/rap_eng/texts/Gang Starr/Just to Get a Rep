[Scratched Hook]
Stick up kids is out to tax
And this is how the story goes

[Verse 1]
Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
Cause in the night you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a four-fifth, I guess you just might
Wanna do a dance or two
Cause they could maybe bust you for self or with a crew
No matter if you or your brother's a star
He could pop you and jet without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame from the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain that the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way he'll have the chain on his neck
Claiming respect, just to get a rep

[Scratched Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ten brothers in a circle had the kid trapped
The one with the hoodie said, "We'll hurt you"
If you don't run all your jewels and pay
Give up the Rolex watch or you won't see another day
See they were on the attack
And one said, "Yo, you wanna make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?"
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the .38, yo, he was inching
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings, and ran frantic
But shorty said, "Now" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep

[Scratched Hook]

[Verse 3]
The rep grows bigger, now he's known for his trigger finger
Rolling with troops of his sons like a gangster figure
He's near the peak of his crazy career
His posse's a nightmare, macking jewels and crazy gear
But as we know, the things we do come back
And Shorty's not peeping, others are scheming to counteract
Cause the kid that got shot didn't perish, so
He pulls up in a jeep with tinted windows
Too late, Shorty was caught in the midst
His time ran out, his number came up, and that's it
You know the rest, so don't front, the plan has been upset
Some brothers gotta go out just to get a rep
