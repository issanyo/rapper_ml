[Hook]
I've lost my ignroance and don't know where to find it
So I search (search) furiously
I've lost my ignroance and don't know where to find it
Yet I search (search) furiously

Stop this and lock this in your trophy case
Cause this one is built for the whole human race
Was INI the only one to experiment
Was the noise I organized ignorant (no)
What is it then it must have been the pen
Or the vibes I send or the time that I spend
Thinking and sinking into the sink
Don't try to swallow this because it's too much to drink
Because

[Hook]

But why do you search for ignorance (I don't)
You can be a dummy Mr. Will (I won't)
What is it that you seek then
Soul in the hip
Getto is the grip so the beat won't slip
Or slide or do a dive into an ocean of lyrical audio
And here's a plate of video
I search and disperse so verse rehersal is universal
Like nova is nobel when I am flowing over ruffell and boulder
I admit my style and wit is a homicidal tool
I'm seeking knowledge like a student in school

[Hook]

We don't know
We don't know
We don't
(repeat 7x)

I venture through darkness with power eclipse
Soul for my guidance my conscence equiped
Opens my thought my neighborhood compels me
The contract swells the head
I feed on my own so here we go into a cool down
The fool found a sound but there's not enough to go around
So we searchers and searchers we searches in ignorance
The outcome of distortion is the evidence
Pre-dominant pre-dominance is how I stand
Phenomenon one phenomenon two (come come)
I seek and I prosper my journey is endless
Keen is my eye sight analyze
Reality fantasy fantasize
