”Ex Girl To The Next Girl” remix b/w “B.Y.S” and “Dwyck”
Chrysalis
Production: DJ Premier

If you are looking for something to invest your hard earned money in, you can’t go wrong with this megaplate by Gang Starr. “Ex Girl To The Next Girl” is song that best exemplifies the “Gang Starr sound.” Its lovely horn loop, coupled with DJ Premier’s unparalleled scratching, take smoothed out rap to new heights. Combine that with Guru’s jazzy, laid-back lyrical flow and you have an instant hit. Guru remembers his mackin’ ways while kicking an interesting tale about ex lovers.

     On the remix tip, Premier creates a completely different track that is compromised of upright bass plucking, some horns and a ringing bell that grows on you after repeated listening. You should also peep the instrumental of the remix as well. The b-side features two versions of “B.Y.S.,” the song where Guru vows to slay all fake MC’s, and is rounded out by inclusion of the non-LP duet with Nice ‘N Smooth, “Dwyck.”
