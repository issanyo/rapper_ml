Check this shit out

[Verse 1]
Brave is the knave who steps up to be slayed
By the one who forgave him for his first mistakes
He'd best behave, or I'mma send him a wave
Of some shocking volts, he doesn't know what he's talkin 'bout
He's kickin a bunch of crap so I'll be the judge of that
The boy lacks artistry and still he tries hard to be
An entertainer, instead he's a waste of
My time and your time so I'll kick the pure rhymes
Whenever you're looking for rap that's exceptional
And credible, straight to the G's you better go
Cause Gang Starr's known to be prone to be
Masters of streetwise poetry and turntable wizardry
And it'll be a cold day in hell
When you hear that the Guru or Premier ever fell
Suckas get sales, but they fail in the long run
The kid who went gold, yo, that was the wrong one
The spotlight tonight is all on me
'Cause I'm the Guru, of the G-A-N-G
Taking out scrubs cause they rub me the wrong way
And I'll say, that they've still got a long way
To go, to show they can flow like a real pro
So gimme that loot and catch the boot from my steel toe
I'm changing the scenery and makin' 'em uncomfortable
Most MC's ain't really got no pull
Watch me stifle em quick with the gift and the wit
Make em quit all that riff as I flip the script

[Hook]
Like this yall (This Yall)
This yall (This Yall)
Du-du-du-du du-du-du-du
This yall

[Verse 2]
You know I flip, yes I flip the script
You know I flip, yes I flip, check it out
Fool listen, I know that you've been missing all this and
So my rhymes are gonna gleam, and glisten
Like a gem, and if you are the fake MC type
I'll shine so bright that I'll be blinding your eyesight
Your capabilities fall short
So I'mma treat you like a dwarf on a basketball court
Still you try to rap and even claim you got new styles
But rolling your tongue's been played out for a while
And you don't sound fly so why are you doing that?
You had a dope track but you're wack and you ruined that
I couldn't make out what you were saying
Your diction Is jumbled whereas me I'm conveying
Clear thoughts, to a crowd that's most critical
Booty duck rappers like you are just pitiful
I bet you couldn't name more than one pioneer
Cause you didn't pay dues and you got on outta nowhere
But that's OK cause I'm peeping your card
And if rap was my house you'd be sweepin the yard
As I recline I'll find more chores to give ya
Like moppin the floors or maybe fetchin my slippers
So don't even trip or run off with the lip
Cause as soon as you slip you know I'll flip the script

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know I flip, yes I flip the script
You know I flip, yes I flip the script
You know as I kick a bit flip the script without a skip
Butter roll MC's can get dissed like this
You'll never got none son I'll become troublesome
You rap like a simpleton and I hate scum
I can easily deflect your threats cause they're idle
My recital will break you down just like a fight til
The end cause I can take ten at a time
Give em all a fair shot to see if any can rhyme
Even if one is decent, I'll still get props
I'll kick the slick lines until the last one drops
As my powerful skills are unveiled, I'm tippin the scales
And weighing much more than your tall tales
Stop the exaggeration perpetration observe
And make a simple notation
Nobody no where no way or no how
Is taking me out cause I can throw so you know now
Can you feel it, I bust the real raps
So lay off, stay off while I steal that
So-called title that you gave yourself
But you really ain't jack so yo you played yourself
And now you look from a distance as you sweat my tip
You know I'll whip you swift when I flip the script
