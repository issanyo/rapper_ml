So many things will happen that one can't explain
You find yourself saying "why me", time and again
They say what goes around, comes around
Ahun, so think about it while you're messing up clown
A mother's love and a father's concern
Here is the reason you should listen and learn
Cause quick schemes and fast living can kill ya
I know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
But take it from somebody who knows
Cause after all the highs, you're gonna feel all the lows
This is why knowledge of self is essential
Cause if you don't have it, you may simply go mental
See, life is not a thing to be toyed wit
Cause every second, another dream is destroyed wit
The systematic plan devised to erase us
And straight to hell is where they're trying to take us
But never fold and hold back your fears
Have a strong mind and try to say your prayers
