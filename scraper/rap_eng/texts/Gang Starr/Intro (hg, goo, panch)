Paroles de la chanson Intro (hg, Goo, Panch) :
(feat. Panch)

Nah you know what we gotta do? We gotta do - HINEY!

The bitch said, "Panch stand behind me

And put that monster in my hiney," HI-NEY!

My dick about killin, never been about game

When there wasn't pussy, there was always my haind

Nine and a half-'ll get you in a dame

Anything less is just a GOD DAMN SHAME!

Check my balls, my shit got blue wrinkles on the face

.. for them bitches who had the nerve to put me out they place

In they HINEY

The bitch said, "Panch stand behind me

And put that monster in my hiney," HI-NEY!

I come through your block, with that one-eye whistle

One hand on the whistle

One.. one-eyed monster hit you

Make it slick, BITCH, my dick game's OFFICIAL!

Lose your weight and, I don't leave you waitin

The world is earthquakin

My balls got yo' ass shakin - it's hiney jack!

UH-OH! HINEY!

The bitch said, "Panch stand behind me

And put that monster in my hiney," HI-NEY!

[imitating the beat] When I bust a nut, it say

[imitating the beat] On her HINEY!

[laughter and applause]

(That's some brilliant shiznit, yo! Aiyyo!)
