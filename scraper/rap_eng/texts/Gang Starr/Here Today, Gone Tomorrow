[Verse 1]
Many MC's are misled
Misled by the lies that they pump in their heads
The money and the fame that they're hoping to find
Will never come close to the scope of my rhyme
Now, some have been successful but really
And yo, these MC's are clearly not nearly
Up to this level, or should I say caliber
It's just some hype that the company's selling ya
'Cause they'll take a dud talkin' crud and they'll push him
But in the next year, someone new will just squish him
'Cause when you sell out to appeal to the masses
You have to go back and enroll in some classes
So cash in your check 'cause it's the last one you get
The tables have turned and now you ain't in effect
So jet to the rear and you better just follow
'Cause what's here today may be gone tomorrow

"You wack MC's" "Ha ha, ha, ha ha, see ya later" (Repeat 2X)

[Verse 2]
Here and gone in a flash
Some made cash while other suckers go broke real fast
Some never make any money but still they act funny
Like they're thinking they're running
Things, wearing rings and medallions
Than listen to their rhymes, one would rather take Valiums
'Cause, swiftness and skills they are lacking
So I send 'em packing, they should have know not to tax in
And smashing all of their vocals to smithereens
Watching them collecting themselves is a bitter scene
But some find happiness while others find sorrow
And what's here today, maybe gone tomorrow

[DJ Premier scratch]
"You wack MC's" "Ha ha, ha, ha ha, see ya later" (Repeat 3X)
