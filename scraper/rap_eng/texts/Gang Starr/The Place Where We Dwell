[Verse 1]
New York, New York is where we live and we're thorough
Never taking shorts cause Brooklyn's the borough
Peace to Uptown, to Queens and the Bronx
Long Island and Jersey get as fly as they want
But I must tell ya, where we rest is no joke
So let me break it down to sections for you slow pokes
Fort Greene, Bed Stuy, Flatbush, Brownsville
Crown Heights and East New York will be down till
Medina takes respect for the styles we bring
Cause in Brooklyn, we be into our own thing
Atlantic Terminals, Red Hook, Bushwick
Come to Brooklyn fronting, and you'll get mushed quick
We ain't just known for flipping and turning out parties
But also for the take no bullshit hotties
On the subject of blackness, well let me share this
Brooklyn is the home for cultural awareness
So in all fairness you can never compare this
Some good some bad, little hope for the weak
Dangerous streets and Coney Island Beach
All this included when you go for a tour
Some can get scandalous and outright raw
When you step, step correct and watch where you move
We pay dues so we ain't trying to lose
Here in Brooklyn, the home of the black and the beautiful
For a rough rap sound, ain't a place more suitable
Other cities claim this, and others claim that
But let me give some props to the place where we be at
B-R-double O-K-L-Y-N
I came here for a visit and ever since then
I've been incorporated with select personnel
Right here in Brooklyn, the place where we dwell

[Hook]
Brooklyn
Way out in Brooklyn
Those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talking

[Verse 2]
Peace to Boston, Philly, Connecticut, DC
All the East Coast cities are fly to me
Peace to everybody down south and out west
But for me, Brooklyn, New York is the best
Don't be afraid to venture over the bridge
Although you may run in to some wild ass kids
Take the J train, the D or the A if you dare
And the 2, 3, 4 or 5 also comes here
There's so much to see cause Brooklyn's historic
Fools act jealous but you have to ignore it
So I just lounge with the fat clientele
Out here in Brooklyn, the place where we dwell

Brooklyn
Way out in Brooklyn
You know the place...
