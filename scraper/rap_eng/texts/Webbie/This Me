[Intro]
I wish for money cars clothes and golds
I was eleven
And now I'm rich and all I wish is that I go to heaven
Just throw a few grams of some purple flowers my coffin
I never turn up on my fam no matter what you offer
Just tell the twins just tell em to relax
I'll be waiting where grandma at
With Ned and uncle Fet
Before I be a buster I'd rather be
Like my big brother cuffed in handcuffs
And ain’t nobody gotta send me nothing
Hard to kill with a heart of steel
Hell yeah, I can raise mother fucking hell

[Hook]
