Intro (Rick Ross)
Trill Entertainment, nigga
Where we keeps it trilla
Webbie, Ricky Ross. Streets gonna love this one

Verse 1: Webbie
The little soldier With nothing
Clear to see
Wasn't nobody handing him shit
Riding around town glamour and glisten

You don't want my position
I'm spitting facts, couldn't relax
The whole time I had weights up on my back

Be black, gone back
I got pitchers on deck
They gave it to us seven flat
How many nigga's gonna rat
Check my tats
She left early then she supposed to, mayne
It had to be fair
Not me, the family and them, could pack the Madison Square
I had a career
I was supposed to be right back there with them
I owed it to Him
I know it I show it
Don't want to blow it
A poet
For the streets
Give me a beat I'mma roll it
I surely didn't believe in magic
But I knew I had it in Savage
It got crucial I ain't panic
And when y'all wanted I ran it
I remember when my Granny
Said anything was to happen
From slangin, hustlin, to trapping
To laying, praying, and jacking
And blowing on Grandaddy and all of my kids happy

Its a miracle
It seem like I'm dreaming
Somebody pinch me
Am I supposed to be in the spot that I'm in?
Is this really real?
It's a miracle
All these years
Am I really here?
Have I really lived what they call a miracle?

Verse 2: Birdman
How you shoot 50 clips
Put it in the air
Mean mug them niggas
And have no fear
Play the game with the stripes
Put it in his life
Ten on the mic
Nigga do it same night
It's a miracle
The way I bend them corners on em
Get up early on em
Get this money on em
A miracle
A lot I bought on
Crib I paid on
Things I've got on
A miracle
Fresh crush the diamond ice
Place in one price
Did it for one night
A miracle
I done lived the high life
Shined in high lights
Did it in gunfights
A miracle
Nigga it was hell we came in
Money done come in
Hell we went in
A miracle, nigga
No time for lying homie
Time for crying homie
Time for dying homie

Chorus

Verse 3: Rick Ross
It's truly a miracle
Your boy is still alive
Cuz I was selling blow in '95
Riding with my boys
Dealin dope, gettin high
Crackers trying to give me time and we ain't talking five
Niggas talk fly so that pistol by my side
My baby mama fucking all my homies on the sly
I see it all through the corner of a nigga's eye
So I keep my shades on and my face up at the sky
Pistols get the power
Snitchin is for cowards
I got plasmas in the shower
And my bitches snorting powder (I'm a G)
My life a movie got rubber uzi's in my jacuzzi
You'll think I'm Biggie
I'm bumping Juicy with several groupies
I got beamerz and benzes, bitch
They all on deuces
I got the product
And when you drop it, it never loses
Pray or get preyed on
Killers get prayed for
If this a dream
I pray I never wake up

Chorus
