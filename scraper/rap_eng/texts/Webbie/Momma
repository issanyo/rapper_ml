I was just sitting and thankin I remember em sayin you was sick
Guess i was too young to understand
I remember we'll all sit around the bed prayin then you'll cry cry it got to me bad
I was bad then you grab ya belt why why why all i keep askin myself
Im holdin my tears ma you got sum pretty granddaughters i just wish you can see them
Sometimes i wish that i wasn't here sumtimes i wish that all of my problems would just disappear
On the real its been 14 years tell me why in the hell it still feel like yesterday still
So i just write to take the stress away really that ont work no more
So i think about the better things like you ain't gotta hurt no more
And ma i hope you hearin me cuz i just want fa you to know I know that you ain't want to leave it wasn't yo choice you had to go
-Chorus
But I no you probably right here beside me standin in this booth with me lovin me and guiding me holdin me protectin me keepin me alive and I had to write this song for you this one fa you momma i no you probably right here beside me standin in this booth with me lovin me and guiding me holdin me protectin me keepin me alive n i had to write this song for you this one for you momma
This yo song ma i had to write it and really ion care if dont nobody else like it
Ain't nobody else like ya you made the way fa me told me i can have whateva i want if i prayed for it
Flowers on ya grave an some times i get a lil crazy
I always respect my elders cause thats just the way you raised me
Sittin in my kitchen and lookin at the pictures just rememberin the times i ain't lyin ya love was price less
I sit up late nite in the dark like ain't no light switch steady askin god why the hell it gotta be like dis
No tellin how yo life go like wen the dice roll you rest in peace i think imma be alright doe
-Chorus
But i no you probably right here beside me standin in this booth with me lovin me and guiding me holdin me protectin me keepin me alive and i had to write this song for you this one fa you momma i no you probably right here beside me standin in this booth with me lovin me and guiding me holdin me protectin me keepin me alive n i had to write this song for you this one for you momma
