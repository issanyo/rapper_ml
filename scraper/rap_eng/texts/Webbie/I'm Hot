[Hook]
I'm hot
It's my turn
I wouldn't touch me cause my hand might burn
I'm cold
You already know
You can go by what you heard depending on what they told ya'

[Verse:1]
Man I knew it be a day some bitch ass nigga crossed
And let whatever fucked him up to come and fuck with a Boss
What, you think Savage done lost it
Now you done laid round' and lost it
And came ???????
Now that shit just gonna cost ya'
Time to kidnap some children, it's time to shoot up some houses
Girl it's all about Webbie, 2007 I'm out
And I'm too little to hit and I'm too Big to forget
And I'm too slippery to hold and I'm too out of control
I'm a phantom you lac I'm a Chopper you mac
I'm too fast for the cash, I wipe my ass with a stack
And ain't nobody fresher, come wipe me down cause I'm on
Should've left this bitch on the dresser
Cause if they catch me I'm gone
My fro too fresh for the throne, I shook the world like a drone
In the heat of the moment, I Give the streets what they want
That's why my cake looking long a hater's face looking long
Apologize to my people for having 'em waiting so long

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2]
Man this shit gotta work, for all my people in the dirt
I'm gonna be bigger than Jigga, if they don't hit me up first
Man, y'all must got me confused
I take niggas by two, I break niggas in two
Man, y'all fake niggas is through
I hear your album is poo, I'm just telling the truth
If it wasn't for heavy promotion I don't know what you do
Now if I slap your in your face, then bitch what you do
Probably nothing
Be surprised and then depend on your crew
I'm straight telling you don't mess with me
Put your all whole crew in Jeopardy
Niggas sweat when they next to me, can't let this shit get the best of me    Y'all been waiting on my single, cause I'm cold and I'm freezing
I been counting big money lighting big blunts with my finger
I'm no longer a dreamer, yeah that shit all in past
Focused on cash, we use to kick ho Niggas all in they ass
Collaborate with everybody, time to get it from ?????
And if you think I'm talking about you
Fuck it, Nigga I am

[Hook 2x]
You just ain't understanding
