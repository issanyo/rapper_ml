Look

Niggas posted on they block
Nose way around the corner
Sniffin nutz around here
Man, you stay way around the corner
You been yapping like a hoe
That's what say around the corner
If you know it like i know
You better stay around the corner
I don't know shit about no murder
I was way in California
With bun b ridin dirty
Smoking purple all that morning
I don't know shit about no robbery
Throwing the wrong charges on me
I was chillin wit yo wife
While you was flightin, an she was lonely
All that pussy azz shit you niggas offering

I don't want it
I don't want to hit yo weed
And i don't wanna be yo homie
Man, let me make my cheese
Get the j's to match my jeans
Go post back up in my jeans
And let 'em go for 2 for 3
You around here saying my name
And claiming i ain't a beast
Regardless of my fame
Bitch i'll aim it up at yo cheek
Before i was rhyming on a beat
I was grindin on the street
Pussy ass nigga worrying bout me
Click, clak

HOOK
Say lil daddy, listen mind ya business
You just like one of these lil bitches, mind ya business
Being nosey, you your sickening, mind ya business
Ole police ass nigga, mind ya business
REPEAT 1
