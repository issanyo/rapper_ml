Well fuck it, go on, turn the music up again
I heat the streets up like a oven, it ain't nothin'
I want mine just hit me up when it's "on time"
I ain't duct-taped me a nigga up in a long time!
I'm'a die thuggin' I think I'm'a die bustin'
I'm'a die hustlin, 'cause I refuse to die with nothin'
Bumpin' crews who drove from Cali in my old school two-tone
They missed me niggas barely, I want they whole fuckin' crew gone!
In that zone, where there ain't no smirks, niggas get murked
Just keep hidin 'cause it's too late to go to church, now
Show you muthafuckers how this trill shit work, now
Turn your shit into the 4th of Ju-ly, boo-ya!
Savage: AKA Webster Gradney Real name still bring flame
Swang hang, let them thang rang
Leave brains all on ya fuckin' shoestrang
I'm tellin you, we ain't playin, we comin'!

You on the internet thug? You wanna buck in the club?
Well guess what? We gon' show you niggas 'bout playin with us
We can't get you, we get the fam Thats just how the game goes
Thought you was a gangsta, but you sweeter than the rainbow

I got a choppa in the car, a choppa in the car
Catch ya stoppin' at the stoplight, pop ya in your car
Pop ya on your ass, treat ya like a ho
? hook up with ya sister, and treat her like a ho
I love ya like a pussy, I hate ya 'cause ya pussy
I'm the trillest nigga livin', bitch
And I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin'
Or anybody drank, and I'll show up in they brain
"What these pussy niggas thinkin'?!"
Webbie You don't got no fuckin' credit
And bitch, you holdin' sumthin so come on, let me get it
I fuck her in her ass, I did it til she shitted
I put it on her ass, shittin on the wrong nigga
I smell blood I smell blood
I feel played, and some skulls gettin' cracked for
Somebody fin' to need a tampon
It's one of these pussy niggas time of the month
