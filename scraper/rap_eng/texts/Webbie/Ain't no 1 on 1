[Lil Boosie]

You already know im diving in nigga
That my nigga but he like my twin nigga
Through the trenches we get it on thats my Corleone
So that mean im riding with him if he right or wrong
Stomp you down put you to pieces this that southern smoke
That my little brother for my little brother i cut your fucking throat
My little sister just drugged a bitch with a loud mouth
Her whole click dived in like colombians
We deep in this bitch, put you to sleep in this bitch
Ain't no one on one girl im fucking you and your friend
If i got beef with a nigga then i got beef with his friend
And if my hitters in the dugout then im sending him in
Who up, we shoot up
That my dog, he got my back
Big Kirby one of you niggas and donkey you after that
My pitbulls full of scratching
They protect the king
Bitch im bucked up
And im fucked up
And im bout that
And thats what i mean


[Webbie]

Nigga fuck with my dog then its gone get retarded
Regardless whose fault it

And yall what im after
Somebody gone get stabbed up
Ain't no one on one
Im trying to light the whole camp up
Savage life bring the beef bout
Stomp all the niggas teeth out
Yall pussy ass niggas dont wanna see what we about
On the way to where drake stay
Bringing contraband to meek house
So the high go wherever we go
Grab all the hoes and then peace out
The beast out but it came out
Yall heard what i said huh
Betcha i betcha i catcha
So whoever is with ya dont end up selling ya
My niggas are donkeys
Get to jumping like monkeys
Jewelry bitches and money
So fuck you niggas like hunkeys
Either busting or hustling
Got to stay into something
Every time shit pop off ain't no secret im jumping
Stomping kicking and booting
We can bring it to shooting
So how yall niggas wanna do it
We been doing this bitch

[Lil Boosie]

Coming through the club with my niggas and we bucking
If we standing then we spilling on each other
If we killing then we killing on the muscle
Nigga hating on another nigga hustle
Fuck that my nuts fat
Drop them like bowling balls
Fuck that im out my body a nigga fuck with my dog
Were scrapping one of you niggas put they paws on you
Them pussy as niggas ain't gone do shit but call the law on me
Dont take nothing bout me for granted
Im a g thats what i said
Thats my shooter (knock the brains out your head)
That my nigga mara
Drop the top on your block
Real bananas 50 rounds these ain't no one on one shots
Daddy use to beat our ass if we ain't jump in a fight
Send us right back round the corner to fight
It ain't no one one one
He in the mix im in the mix
He in some shit im in some shit
Ain't no one on ones
If it is it ain't no clique
Ain't no snake
Ain't no coward
Ain't no bitch
Ain't no rat
So dont come round here tripping
Im telling you now
How we rocking
