What you think bruh, I ain’t got a bank bruh
If anybody want some beef just tell em [?]
These fools ain’t got nothing to lose just tryna gain some
Ain’t one time I played the pussy where I came from
I can go back is like that I’m the same one
Y’all need to get the fuck back cause there’s train coming
I got a bad bitch you keep [?]
Every night Mary Jane I ain’t never with the same woman
I run the streets I’m right here cause only hoes run
I got it hard didn’t nobody left me home nothing
No matter what you heard about me least you heard something
You keep on acting like a hoe gonna get your head banged
I need a rubber so I told ma brother just one
Soon as I call her I had to tell her bitch run
Far as I remember I made my own [?]
