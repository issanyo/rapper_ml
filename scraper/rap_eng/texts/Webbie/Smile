[Chorus: Joeazzy]
I need a smile
Keep it one hundred with my niggas, we gon' be okay
Is there a heaven for a gangster if I die today?
So many nights I had to hustle for a brighter day
I need a smile
Don't let 'em change your face, they wanna take your place
Behind your back they fake, they gon' hate anyway
I know they lost, I pray they find their way

[Verse 1: Webbie]
I got pictures of killer bitch, I'm itching to kill a bitch
Shoot him all in his ear shit and back to the Beverly
Savage life, ain't gon' never switch 'til I meet the devil bitch
And if you ever see fit to send tell him I say whatever bitch
I got hate on my shoulders dog, got weight on my shoulders dog
See you got to go to war, you can't wait on your soldiers dog
You ain't fucking, you ain't involved, sweet zones, I told 'em all
I met 'em at Strogers y'all, and drawers, I broke 'em all
You better get focused dog, treat rappers like roaches dog
Go straighten your Webbie 'fro up on somebody notice dog
I ain't goin' nowhere dog, I already told y'all
Now y'all better go at all before I be done showed y'all

[Chorus: Joeazzy]
I need a smile
Keep it one hundred with my niggas, we gon' be okay
Is there a heaven for a gangster if I die today?
So many nights I had to hustle for a brighter day
I need a smile
Don't let 'em change your face, they wanna take your place
Behind your back they fake, they gon' hate anyway
I know they lost, I pray they find their way

[Verse 2: Joeazzy]
Even though I'm young and I'm ready
Wanna lock me up and forget me
I just been texting and fetty
They just been plotting to get me
Gotta keep that thing filled with fifty
Girl 'dem say come here then I'm dipping
I smoke most [?] 'cause I'm tripping
And they know they hate how I'm living
I tell 'em I don't fuck with fake ones, I just stay away
MJ on my haters, I just fade away
If I lost it all I'd be straight, bitches leave niggas out every day
Backstab but smile in your face, turn statements in on your case
Niggas be testifying, but I go to jail for mine
Put a check on your head for mine, I bet you won't mess with mine
If you tryna smoke to smoke, whatever gon' rock your boat
These niggas gon' knock your flow, whatever don't stop you go

[Chorus: Joeazzy]
I need a smile
Keep it one hundred with my niggas, we gon' be okay
Is there a heaven for a gangster if I die today?
So many nights I had to hustle for a brighter day
I need a smile
Don't let 'em change your face, they wanna take your place
Behind your back they fake, they gon' hate anyway
I know they lost, I pray they find their way
