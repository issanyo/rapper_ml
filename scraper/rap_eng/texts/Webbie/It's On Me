[Intro: Joeazzy]
Easy way, hey, ayy

[Chorus: Joeazzy]
Might think I'm trippin' and slippin' but you better know that it's on me
I know that you niggas won't get me, I know that your love turning phony
Just talked to big dog, it's my time now, yeah it's on me
Check out your bitch dog, better peep out the hate in your homie
And that's why it's on me, yeah that's why it's on me
And that's why it's on me, yeah I keep it on me
Check out your bitch dog, better peep out the hate in your homie
Just talked to big dog, it's my time now, yeah it's on me

[Verse 1: Joeazzy]
It never leave off me, they try to insult me
And these niggas really broke as shit but that don't involve me
No that don't concern me, you niggas ain't scarin' me
I keep that bitch on me, 'cause they want to burn me, hey
I'ma go fund the kids up on a trip, nearly like Cancun how I drip
I got a bam-boom on the hip, kill all your damn goons when it rip
Pull up and vroom vroom, gotta dip
I got no damn room in my whip
Don't really trust nobody 'round here
Pull out my twister, fifty round clips
Watch what you say, remember what you hear
One call will get your ass out of here
Come in your job and shoot him where you live
I'm at your head, my nigga, at your rib
We don't surrender, we don't ever chill
When they say murder it's kill or be killed
Big ugly chopper, it look like Shaquille
I can't spare these niggas, I can't let 'em live

[Chorus: Joeazzy]
Might think I'm trippin' and slippin' but you better know that it's on me
I know that you niggas won't get me, I know that your love turning phony
Just talked to big dog, it's my time now, yeah it's on me
Check out your bitch dog, better peep out the hate in your homie
And that's why it's on me, yeah that's why it's on me
And that's why it's on me, yeah I keep it on me
Check out your bitch dog, better peep out the hate in your homie
Just talked to big dog, it's my time now, yeah it's on me

[Verse 2: Webbie]
Built to last like Don P, trill ass like Pimp C
Quadruple hard, triple OG
It's up nigga, and that's on me
Smokin' whole tree, hope I don't be
Disrespected or you gon' see
Somethin' you probably don't wan' see
This savage life, this ain't TV
Single father, got D3, that room smellin' like pee-pee
It take hard work, keep God first, my head hurt, I need a BC
Don't be on my IG tryna try me like I don't see
'Cause I do, say what? who? I'll come through and that's on me
You're mad, you gon' be, I'm so main, that's on me
This rap game ain't no thing, get your old thing, she on me
California weed junky, I probably need another room key
I just had it up on me, I'm so glad it's up on me

[Chorus: Joeazzy]
Might think I'm trippin' and slippin' but you better know that it's on me
I know that you niggas won't get me, I know that your love turning phony
Just talked to big dog, it's my time now, yeah it's on me
Check out your bitch dog, better peep out the hate in your homie
And that's why it's on me, yeah that's why it's on me
And that's why it's on me, yeah I keep it on me
Check out your bitch dog, better peep out the hate in your homie
Just talked to big dog, it's my time now, yeah it's on me
