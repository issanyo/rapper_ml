[Verse 1]
Girl pop that pussy for a pimp with yo big fine ass
Champagne straight up out the bottle don’t need no wine glass
Franklin's flying by like minutes you know how time pass
Like they doing circles at the door
We got that [?] yeah
Got cash on the floor got ass on the floor
Put a hand in the air
Yes indeed she [?]
She told me please don’t get in the hair
Girl shake that sexy ass booty
You know everybody looking at you don’t be shy
A lot of these other hoes don’t [?] try
Girl you got it I ain’t even gon' lie
Her booty like a waterbed her pussy like Michael Jordan head
Ball life laughing [?] bitches i’m retarded
Though so much has changed to make it through till we alert the Feds
If we make it rain like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, all he wanna do is see it bounce (i know)
All i wanna see is his account
And how many racks he’ll stack in my bag when he looking
Tell me how much cash he’ll spend on a bitch with a shoe fetish
Nigga don’t pretend cause these Louis Vuitton ain’t cheap
You gotta order these you can’t get these in boutique
Twerk twerk she stand on her hands but you got to pay
(work work)
Bandz a make her dance just like Juicy J
They keep asking how i’m so short
And how I pack all a that in these shorts
When I walk it look like two basketball bouncing on the basketball court
Ain’t that a double dribble well blow your fucking whistle
I stopped the whole game

[Verse 3]
Girl you got so much sass
And I got so much weight
I lie on Acres been here three years and still ain’t met my Neighbours
I kiss your Navel, kiss that pussy just return the favor
Got sparkles on my bottles like new years at my table
Girl let a nigga see what you got
That’s enough you done make me hot
We can leave here and go to my spot
Think your old man gon get shot
I just wanna see you go hard she threw it on me oh lord
You deserve a oh God that pussy mine [?]
Don’t be no tease baby i know you want this cheese baby
Rub off five grand with ease baby

Got girl scout up in this filett baby
That’s your real ass, really baby
