Wassup wassup wassup
Turn it up
Webbie
Trill E-N-T. Young Savage
Just some gangsta shit for the gangstas to ride to

"Damn mane, what you don't fuck with a nigga no mo? "
Don't even come at me like that!
"Damn nigga, Webbie, where you been at? "
Out here gettin rich nigga. Fuck out my face
I'm a fuckin hustler nigga, I ain't got time to be playin nigga, I'm tryin get it
(I'm tryin to do somethin.)

Check me out, Look

[Verse 1:]
Now I'mma tell you like a man, I don't owe ya'll shit
And I'm gonna say this shit again
I don't owe ya'll shit
But before a nigga had somethin, (shitt)
I ain't have nothin (my kids)
Yeah they still love me (friends)
I had a couple of em
Wasn't nobody fussin, tryin to see what was up
When my shoes was been dusty, with a hole in the front
And I'd get mad at Lil Slugger, he put a hole in the blunt
When my daddy lost the house, moved with grandma for a month
Then that month turned into a year
And I turned strait to them streets
Then my dog gave me that b
I turned the shit to that heat
Them school fights turned to that beef
And we was gon fall for that street
Then my nigga turned to that piece
I ain't seen him since I was 13
I get home and catch my knees
This rap shit was just a dream
Wasn't nobody mad at me tellin me about how I need to come see em
I ain't have a car, I just need some new rims
Just tell ole boy he just got a new Benz
My daddy used to tell me that I needed some new friends
I guess back then, it just didn't make sense

[Hook:]
Now come on
Keep it trill
You been knowin me since I was lil
And you ain't even take me serious mane that's why a nigga feel like (You a Trip!)
How you be trippin (You a Trip!)
I be trippin (You a Trip!)
How I be glistenin (You a Trip!)
It's a trip over postiton (You a Trip!)
It's a trip how you miss me (You a Trip!)
Now don't take it wrong and think I'm trippin cause I'm on
But um really you can go on and leave me the fuck alone (You a Trip!)
How you be trippin (You a Trip!)
I be trippin (You a Trip!)
How I be glistenin (You a Trip!)
It's a trip over postiton (You a Trip!)
It's a trip how you miss me (You a Trip!)

[Verse 2:]
I had to tell lil nigga from the club
I'm still the same nigga from the mud
So watch how you be runnin up questionin me about stupid stuff
I'm well known from the boot and up
Don't come up to me with that bootin up
Mane how I been movin up
I really hate to have to go and shoot ya up
In just 2000 I was ridin a bus
Show up at school, get expelled, fuck it
I'm out here, If I go to jail, fuck it
Didn't this many people care for me
Now a nigga rich you is there for me
And I owe you this and I owe you that (What?)
You not nothin till you got somethin, everbody love ya
Pops told me that
Niggas ain't shit, life showed me that
They done stole from me
They done hold me back
You round here actin like hoes would act
Tell me how I'm supposed to act
I see yo ass, be yo ass
Comin up, I ain't barely see yo ass
Tryin to be me, be done beat yo ass
Hard head, make a nigga teach yo ass
Tell you the truth, I don't need yo ass
All I really need is my dog fans
And all my people that I feel fam
This big Glock 40 and Trill Fam
Ya'll look mad, I'mma steal laugh
Them new Camaros go real fast
They don't come out till "09" already got mine
Man I'm fittin to act a dog now

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Big Head]
Look, Big Head the same nigga till he dead and gone
The same nigga that wasn't allowed in yo home
The same nigga that did that same dirt with that chrome
The same nigga that did them same jokestas all along
Why would I change now
Just because the camera's on
And yo girl got my dick in her camera phone
Mane let me do my thing
I'm in that zone
You hatin cause I'm makin and you dead wrong
Well if you ain't gon kill me
Ain't no stoppin me
Watch, I get the whole board on Monopoly
Matter fact, fuck ya'll with a apostrophe
That is how you want it
So that is how it gotta be
I probably pop yo ass approximately with 6 slugs
While Turk and Mel buy the judge
You got a grudge but remember I don't give a fuck
Whenever you get mad enough
Try yo luck!

[Hook:]
