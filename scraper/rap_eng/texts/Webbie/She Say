She say he say ?
No
Say!
She say he say ?
Say it!
Whatever, man, this shit is crazy!

She say every time she talk is like I never listen
Ask me why we never kiss, she say seem like I'm always flipping
She say every time she talk is like I never listen
Act like all I like is money running around with different bitches

She say every time she talk is like I never listen
Ask me why we never kiss, she say seem like I'm always flipping
She say every time she talk is like I never listen
Act like all I like is money running around with different bitches

She's got a new phone
I wiped out the slow songs
Tell me how this whole gone
Said she's 'bout to move on
Bye, ain't gonna cry
Now, this the reason why
I keep a bitch on the side
But she's holding nigga down
And now she say she's tired
Wow, my life, see
She ain't feeling to cry
No more. No. It just give you a hole
When you wanna hit assailing
Bust it open on the floor
I never had coffee, I'm not a popo
But you know you got to squeeze
I got you two to leave
Man, you know I got that cheap
And you know how it be
I can lay up on the Ubber
I'm too much up in the streets

She say every time she talk is like I never listen
Ask me why we never kiss, she say seem like I'm always flipping
She say every time she talk is like I never listen
Act like all I like is money running around with different bitches

? I'm telling you the truth
I've got a family at home, bu
That's hard to believe
And yet, I do what I want, too
But my baby ain't tripping, she know who I belong to
She know I keep a list of bad bitches I'm known to
But I won't be doing nothing, my reputation's too strong, too
Be with all that side shit, so I won't even try the shit
Climb first, cloud then, collide with my side bitch
Buy shit, she riding it, take a spin like classic
She's on her ass, she's so happy that she's my bitch
And she's got a nigga, probably a lot of niggers
I bought her a phone, she call me when she ain't by the niggers
And she's straight by the money, how she's doing a lot of niggers
I watch her clothes clothes, ?
I drive her crazy, though, she my little baby, though
And she already know everytime I hit the dough

She say everytime she talk is like I never listen
Ask me why we never kiss, she say seem like I'm always flipping
She say everytime she talk is like I never listen
Act like all I like is money running around with different bitches

Now, how you gonna say that, girl, you know that ain't right!
You know I like you, you know I love life
I love ice, I love cars, I love living
I love seeing my niggers walking about the freezers
I'm on a mission, got no time to be hugging and kissing
Time going fast, baby I gotta get it
I love growing money, I hate it being broke
I love t smoke, but reggae is what I hate the most
I rather trip than slip, baby, and I ain't slipping
If you leave, you be ready to miss me. You can't blame me
It's what the streets did me, what? You forgot
That you promised that you'll be here with me?
We'll fuck ? but you'll never forget me
Think I'mma loose me the sleep, girl, forget it!
And then we brake-up, and then we make-up
I just can't leave this girl alone, shit, say what?

She say every time she talk is like I never listen
Ask me why we never kiss, she say seem like I'm always flipping
She say every time she talk is like I never listen
Act like all I like is money running around with different bitches
