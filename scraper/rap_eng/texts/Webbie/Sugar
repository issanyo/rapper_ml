If I said you wasn't the world to me , I'd be lying
And you're the only one
I told you, your one of a kind
I go this all the way for you I think your a dime
I came from the bottom to the top, bottom line
Sometime we kiss, sometime we don't in a long time
But still gonna be together forever, that's a long time
Permanent scars but the pain never really lasts
Eventually we cool off
We're just a really ?

You know this album is a regular old dog fight
We just laugh and apologize all night
I never told you
How I could picture you standing in a all white dress
And a dude on our piano with somewhere were its sunny in the island
Walking and smiling, the preacher get to talkin'
So happy you start crying
And we promise on our mamas
We'll do good through the dramas
We ain't even in the in
Ain't no reason they can even make a move

I'm so caught up in fuckin love wit ya, baby
Deep and it feels sweet, sugar
No tellin what I do behind you, crazy
And just living this is killing me, Mercedes

I'm so caught up in fuckin love wit ya, baby
Deep and it feels sweet, sugar
No tellin what I do behind you, crazy
And just living this is killing me, Mercedes

Its feeling like we done been everywhere but heaven, hell
Man I must be trippin, I hear wedding bells
And then you bust me doin nothin, you know it never fails
Then I'll be hurt
Cuz you heard somethin that wasn't even real
Yeah I'm gon' lie and tears gon'cry
Your face gonna dry as the years go by
I done reached a point to man up to say that I was silly
To even be up in some places, no I'm not admitting

We should be in a honey moon like somewhere in britian
A castle with a hundred rooms, I ain't bull shittin'
I'm ready to say I do, I say it loud and proud
I'm just askin God what's gonna happen if I break my vows
Will you ban me or understand me?
From fuckin different hoes
Fuck me up for saying marry me
Another woman told me she think I should get a grammy
Actin' like I love her, she just couldn't understand me

I'm so caught in fucking love with you, baby
Deep and it feels sweet, sugar
Don't tell em what I do behind you, crazy
And just living this is killing me, Mercedes

I'm so caught in fucking love with you, baby
Deep and it feels sweet, sugar
Don't tell em what I do behind you, crazy
And just living this is killing me, Mercedes

We done did all that
We might as well go in
With my crazy ass people and your messy friends
And the screamin' and the hollerin about leavin shit
And Lord I knows I don't wanna go through that again
Look me in my eyes and promise to me that your stayin
And we'll go to the top
I promise to you that's the plan
And you know my ways
Can you put up with all my stuff
And all that cussin' and the fussin' for all the days
With your crazy ass
And you know I'ma keep you mad
You know I bust my ass to see you glad
And you been with me since rags
And now we richer if you really pay attention
Bar our life's a pretty picture
And I wanna spend the rest of it wit ya
Like you make me stronger
You never thought less of a nigga
Not you and that's why I got you
Before you think it's not true I do
Wake up

I'm so caught in fucking love with you, baby
Deep and it feels sweet, sugar
Don't tell em what I do behind you, crazy
And just living this is killing me, Mercedes

I'm so caught in fucking love with you, baby
Deep and it feels sweet, sugar
Don't tell em what I do behind you, crazy
And just living this is killing me, Mercedes
