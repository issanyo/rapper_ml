[Hook]
Ya'll niggas is liars
Ya need to start watching the wire
Cause you ain't never been through the fire
I'm posted on this block until I retire

Cause homie I stay ten toes down
I stay ten toes down x4

[Verse 1: Webbie]
Now pimp ya'll chip broke
But Imma leave our chip paid
So all bitch niggas watch ya'll mouth
And stay the fuck out my way
Im the savage BRC
Wanna know how I look, turn on tv
Me play it like a trill OG
Pull in the VIP in a Bent GT
See my eyes Im about that there
Been through about 1000 [?] I ain't melt
I ain't no lie, I put it on myself
Ten toes down, I ain't going no where
See I creep slow and stalk 'em
Them burning coals I walk 'em
Them people know too much
Man Somebody gotta be talking
My watch two-hundred thousand
Just bought two-hundred houses
I done put up the whole fam'
Wanna a show, just call Ram
Aw damn I think they riding
And they plotting on stopping me
In order for that shit to be
Gon have to put that Glock on me
Ya watching cause ya hating cause Im making it thats obviously
When I get on the mic gon be a straight fucking catastrophe
Pass the weed actually that fire be relaxing me
Savage life Trill ENT
Man my label done made a beast

[Verse 2: Tha Joker]
Joker too cold, you know how I play
In the south we dare mothafuckas to step on this red clay
Can't rap about dope, Im the streets, is you insane
Fuck around and make a whole rock album like Wayne, bang
You know Im always in the public with that
Smelling like Killa but I never been with Dipset
Get that, KO you know Imma hold you down
Especially from Mississippi, I post in Jacktown
Hoes turn yo ass down, and the thugs don't respect ya
Cause you wanna be real but ya heart won't let ya
Bet ya that ya couldn't walk a mile in these shoes
Im soo ten toes down my fucking J's got roots
