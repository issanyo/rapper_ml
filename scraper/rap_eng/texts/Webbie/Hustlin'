[Webbie]

Webbie, Lil boosie, Trill Entertainment
I'm the dope man holla at me ( Holla at me nigga)

[Verse 1: Webbie]

Hard,soft,heavy or light I'm coming with it
Stamped up, pretty and white, come on get it
Got that hell of a ice at a hell of a price
Man, whatever you spend you gon' make it back twice
And if I feel you a soldier, then I'm weighing it nice
In one big bulger, just like you like it
Pure, no soda just like you like it
The whole block roll like dice and I like it
My team like the Lakers, I'm Kobe I'm with a white chick
All in her ass taking her fast and I like it
Bad bitch, nothing but class and she feisty
Smart as hell nothing but ass and I like it
This beef shit it ain't nothing to it, just try me
Niggas that walk up and just do it, like Nike
Nigga, come make it happen it's real
I ain't jackin I'm trill
Young Savage look here (Holla at me come on)

[Hook 2x]
Ooh, and I'm hustling (and I'm hustling) cause I'm a hustler baby
Ooh, and I'm hustling (and I'm hustling) shit I'm hustling crazy

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
Now you dont know too many youngsters superfool in that kitchen
But I was raised 'round hustlers, and Boosie do listen
What if he want a nine of soft but he changed his mind
And you can't rock it up now you done lost that shine
I sold weed, ex pills and a lot of lil hoes
Snatched purses, sold verses and them bottles of fours
Distributed Lortabs xan bars and dro
I flipped my 'Lac off morphine but we call it K4
And I done jacked a lot of niggas on the cool
Thought he had 20 pounds but I sold him rabbit food
Bitch, and Im the only nigga jackin without a gat
He thought he had a block but I melted candle wax
Ya, and Im gon' tax these niggas cause they gon' buy it anyway
Just to say just got Boosie and he sold him some Yay
Used to be wilin' outrageous talking 'bout business on phones
Till I got with Mel and T, now my hustling got strong
And you can't tell me 'bout hustling cause I'm a vet
And I'm smart with this shit, cause nigga I ain't Joe Shit
That's a hustler nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Webbie]

From AM to PM, you come through you see Slim
If I'm gon' catch a sale hell, holla at Lil' B and them
Say whoadie we got them Os and for cheap prices
Put my shit on 24s before I got a license
One of my lil' hoodrat hoes is so trifling
I get to squirting all in her nose and she like it
You smoke that, you toot that
We distribute that
You know where the spot at, you want that we got that
Four and a half for 28 you can't top that
That whole slab 16 five you got a profit
Break it in half 86 fifty, depend on who you is
Drop ain't nothing, try to come get me I wish a nigga will
Jiggas nigga, if you be jiggin we got them fire pills
You getting them for lesser than 10? Then they higher here
I ain't trying to go to the pen so like mices
Me and my hustlers work the gutter so quiet
If any nigga step on our toes we start riots
And fill motherfuckers with holes and we like it

[Hook]
