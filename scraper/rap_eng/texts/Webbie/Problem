[Intro: Webbie]
Huh, What? [x8]

[Hook: Boosie Badazz & Webbie]
Nigga, do you gotta problem?
Cause you can get exposed
Hope you got your hittas let 'em know
Nigga, you fucking with a problem? (A problem)
We be throwing 4's (4's)
Stomping out niggas like the zone
Nigga, we solve problems (problem)
We come to your door
Knock, knock, chop, chop (knock knock knock knock knock...)
Here we go
Cause we heard you had a problem (A problem)
Gotta problem, nigga? (A problem)
Gotta problem, nigga? (A problem)
Gotta problem, nigga? (A problem)

[Verse 1: Boosie]
I went to gutter school, Boosie Boo a problem solver
Me and my a lil goon and my .38 Revolver
Cut your throat twice, thug life, bulldoggin'
Bitch, if it's beef, we don't sleep, we stalkin'
Send a ride to see your pussy-ass and won't be late
Bitch nigga, you got a problem, you must don't want your face
You fucking with a ace in the hole, a maniac, nigga
Smoke fire all that, Boosie bringing that, nigga
Bust your head in the 'lac, rip the threads off the seats
Tattletaling-ass nigga, "Boosie messing with me!"
That's you letting em drugs make you fuck with a G
You got a problem, bitch, I'm putting you to sleep
Bitch ya ass gotta...

[Hook: Boosie & Webbie]

(I'm telling you, Savage Life... What's Happening? Look.)

[Verse 2: Webbie]
Say what's on your mind, let me know how you feel
Boy I do this all the time and you know I'm for real
And you know I'm with Trill
Hunt your dog like a deer
But we ain't gotta get retarded
Man, I'm just tryna chill
Got the ball no fumbling
Cross us, we rumbling
Fuck ya'll niggas, we don't need no company
California Ganja and
You know how we coming, it's
Never 1 on 1, you know everybody jumping in
Pumps in the trunk, just in case we have to hunt again
Hit you in your legs see that you don't ever run again
Put that dick up on her, got her moaning, feeling cum again
Look, I know you pussy boy, but I was still wondering...

[Hook: Boosie & Webbie]

[Verse 3: Boosie & Webbie]
Boy you fuck with Boosie, you gon' get your shit wet
It's like Mouse on the track, it's a hit after that
You're a bitch, you're a rat, you're a stone-cold sucka
I'm a G from across the tracks and I'm a stone-cold hustla

[Webbie]
And plus I got in me
You know why I get to pimping
R.I.P to Pheezus, still got bustas I ain't get yet
Rappers get to tripping
We pop the full clips in
We scrape the track with niggas
This ain't just here for the dissing

[Hook]
