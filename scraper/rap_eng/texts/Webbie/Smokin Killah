[Verse 1]
Trillionaire, we gettin' chedda [?], that's how we hide out
Ten stories made my house just like a high house
Fresh pounds, still wet when we buy it out
You know that killa burn da best when it's dried out
Back to back, back to back nigga where it's at
I'm smokin' white boys, and you know I'm black
No seeds, no indeed when we blowin' weed
My son told me when he grow up that he growing weed
Burnt chips, burnt lips, burnt fingertips
My nigga got burnt, I burn blunts for him
Cigarillos for the ghettos, better sell those
Boys go 'head
Hey, you know that

[Hook]
We smokin' on that killah
Roll it, blow it (x7)
We smokin' on that killah
Roll it, blow it (x7)
We smokin' on that killah
Roll it, blow it (x7)
We smokin' on that killah
Roll it, blow it (x7)
We smokin' on that killah

[Verse 2]
Shit savage, I'm smokin' zig-zags on they bitch ass
Cross me, get straight smoked, I'm talkin' 'bout puff, puff, pass
I stay high - first class
I'm straight fly, that's straight gas
Kno my grade is that high grade
I been gettin' blazed since eighth grade
I made it here, I'm kinda happy
Presidential shit, Obama had it
It don't matter who had it, fuck, we burn it until it's gone
And go get sum mo
And then do it again
Now we rollin' this fat blunts
Y'all steady rollin them [?]

[Hook]
We smokin' on that killah
Roll it, blow it (x7)
We smokin' on that killah
Roll it, blow it (x7)
We smokin' on that killah
Roll it, blow it (x7)
We smokin' on that killah
Roll it, blow it (x7)
We smokin' on that killah

[Intro: Verse 3]
Blow it, blow it
Blow it, blow it, Sweet Jones Jr.!
Look

[Verse 3]
Pass the blunt, pass the blunt
It came down to the last what?
Get a big drag, huh, then throw that bitch away like my last gun
Get your hustle on, stack all your cheese
Make sure you stay around all Gs
Real niggas, that's all you need
All these pussy niggas do is try to hog all the weed
Smoke a zip a day, a clip a stay
Around the way, just in case
One of these pussy niggas try to play
Then all these pussy niggas got to pay
250 a zip, 50 round clips, 28 grams, straight out da scale
Straight till I die, heaven or hell
I can just tell that nigga a sell that killah for real
You could just smell as soon as you inhale
It's hittin' you, yeah
Then pass it around, I ain't got shit but real niggas in here
Real niggas in here
I ain't got shit but real niggas in here
Real niggas in here
I ain't got shit but real niggas in here

[Outro]
Roll it, blow it (x16)
We smokin' on that killah
Roll it, blow it (x7)
We smokin' on that killah
Roll it, blow it (x7)
We smokin' on that killah
