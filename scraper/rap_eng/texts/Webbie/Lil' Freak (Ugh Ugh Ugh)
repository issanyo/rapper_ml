Spendin' money, buyin' bling

Make me wanna scratch up get some brain how you fit them jeans

She put her legs on my shoulders and I long dick her like
Ugh ugh ugh

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
Look at Ms. Goody-Goody pussy right there
With that pretty-ass face and that pretty-ass hair
With some pretty-ass eyes and a pretty-ass smile
I guess that one drink I bought'll be worth my while
With ya double-D rack and a tattoo on your back
And I really dig the way your pussy lookin' from the back
Matter of fact I think I'll start from the back
Made my mind in in from the back
Gimme one more win once again from the back
I'm goin' in, think I'll win with some that
Some Hen, some Cap, some droolin' on my pipeline
Give ya boy oral 'till his heart flatline
