[Intro: Lil Boosie]
I just wanna show the world
That I really do this shit
That I really make quality street music, know what I'm talking about
And it ain't no mistake that I'm this good
I just done seen seen a lot, you know what I'm talking about

[Hook: Lil Boosie and Kiara]
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel it, lil hustler
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel it, lil nigga

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
I got my own voice, sing my own hooks
Fresh fade, nice smile, got my own look
I just like to make people happy
Four kids, I just like being a good daddy
But I'm a gangsta and I rock shows
A people person, so you know Lil Boosie got hoes
Damn, hoes, that's a figure of speech
Get a lotta shit like that when you listen to me
As for my fans, I love y'all
Straight up, y'all a part of me, so when they hate, they hate us
Money keep a nigga going to better things
Mane, I take it to the bank, I don't make it rain
But I'm fly like Weezy
Plus, the hood niggas, man, they believe me like Jeezy
And I just like to have a good time
Hit the yo, smoke one, and put my life in my rhymes

[Hook: Lil Boosie and Kiara]
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel it, lil hustler
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel it, lil nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
Father, forgive me, I was raised on some real shit
So I can't sugarcoat shit, not a lil bit
Inside, I'm sad 'bout my dad
Since I lost my grams, ain't been giving a damn
But I still hold my head high, and sometimes I cry
But when I cry, mane, I don't know why
I feel trapped to be a superstar
A hundred thousand worth of jewelry to end it
And I spend it, with no problem
You don't like Badazz, then that's your problem
M.O.B., wouldn't give a damn if the hoes holla
Love cars, love broads, with a passion
I ain't never have shit, so I'm flashy
I work hard, go and get it on the road
Seven month run, 750 out for shows, get it?
I'm hood rich, still smoking that good shit
Still got the same hood clique

[Hook: Lil Boosie and Kiara]
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel it, lil hustler
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel it, lil nigga

[Verse 3: Webbie]
I told my teacher to her eyes, I'mma make it there
She ain't even look surprised, gave me another F
Or a fucking D, happy you got a C
Fuck the world and be whatever you wanna be
Ain't nothing like a strong mind and some confidence
Whenever you step outta line, it's a consequence
We all overseas, we puffing weed
We'll make you niggas bleed, yes in-fucking-deed
747, yelling 747
On the real, we gotta be a couple miles from heaven
The world tried to pull us down, but we ain't fucking let it
I woulda did some of it different, but I don't regret it
That's one thing about me, though, I never been a quitter
That's seizure shit, crazy, shout out to the hospital
Rest in peace, ma, I'mma be on TV
Young Savage, Sweet Jones, Trill Family

[Hook: Lil Boosie and Kiara]
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel it, lil hustler
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel it, lil nigga
