(Intro)
It ain't nothin' like a big fine bitch, straight up
Trill Fam

(Pre-Hook)
Tonight I'm lookin' for a ratchet
Give me a gutter or a freak ho
And she ain't gotta be a bad bitch
But she just gotta suck dick though

(Hook)
Where she at?
Girl i'm lookin' for a fuck friend
Tonight i'm lookin' for a fuck friend
Girl i'm just lookin' for a fuck friend

Girl i'm lookin' for a fuck friend
Tonight i'm lookin' for a fuck friend
Girl i'm lookin' for a fuck friend

Where she at?

(verse 1: Webbie)
She ain't gotta have a house and a benz truck
She just gotta lick nuts, and love or get my dick sucked
And she ain't even gotta have a big butt
But i got a big dick, so I wish ya good luck
She don't need no fake hair, (?)
I'ma keep it GC, i'm just trynna skeet skeet
Ye its baby get ya ready, young sweet sweet
Bust it open for me gon let me go deep sea
We don't ever make love I just fuck her hard
I let her keep her old man in that other bar
And i swear to god, you can ask her she a tell ya
I'm the best at throwing dick, it ain't nobody better for her

(Verse 2: Webbie)
Ass butt naked just say i'm zoned
Er'ybody missin' calls, those camera phones
But they ain't trippin', they just drippin'
They'll be tippin, they'll be rippin'
They'll be switchin', when we finished
We get right back to the bidness
And we winnin' check the scores
Stop that hatin' get ya ho
Don't forget to hit the store
Check ya head that's a no
STD's i'm just trynna stay safe
Tell them cartoon niggas
Stay up in a safe place
Fell ya self, fell the bass
Kill yourself, sell ya grace

And they ain't gotta say no more
Cuz you can ask and she a tell ya
When it come to throwing dick

(Verse 3: Foxx)
I'm lookin' for a friend, with benefits
Bitch I ain't no gentleman
Slim waist, cute face ass like cinnamon
She got a old man, but that pussy ain't his
I'ma babysit that pussy, while he babysit them kids
Got inches in ya ribs, baby take it (?)
I ain't trippin' on ya stretch marks, cut the lights off
Girl I'm lookin' for a ratchet, girl I been had you
Gon let me fuck you in the burger king bathroom
All that dick up in ya drawers, prolly reachin' for the breasts
I'ma hit it from the back, Webbie you get in the front
I ain't lookin' for no wife, just a fuck friend
Say your bored, I got a idea, lets fuck then
