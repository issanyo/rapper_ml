[I'll be missin you, missin you]

(Webbie-Talking)
Hello, Young Savage
What you doin?, Trill E-N-T
[I'll be missin you, I'll be missin you], Webbie

[Verse 1-Webbie]
I ain't been home in a few days(I miss you)
I know you do, I ain't gon'lie I miss you too
Come kiss me through the phone, I'mma kiss you too
Now I'mma hit you in a minute-gotta get this loot
Girl we got us somethin special, I know it ain't nothin better
You can trust me cause I'm tellin ya I don't want nothin else
You get lonely you can just use the pictures up on the dresser
I ain't never think a woman could have me this lil'feelin
Girls'll walk up on me flirtin, I be tellin e'm "Nah I'm chillin"
Hug you till I go to sleep just to squeeze you like my lil'pillow
Then I wake up Monday mornin'don't come back till Friday
In my whole 'nother whip, sittin on 6's with tinted windows
Baby phat bags, all the purses with matchin'slippers
You done heard I fucked this dumb bitch-now you mad trippin
Tears in ya eyes, yellin you tired of my fast livin
I'm just happy for to see ya, godamn...I miss you

(Chorus-Le'Toya)
Since you went away, I been down and lonely
Since you went away, I been thinkin of you
Ooooooh I'm missin you, Ooooooh I'm missin you

[Verse 2-Webbie]
From rags to riches, if that shit was to hit me again
I'd have to bring you with me again
It done been alot of stuff I found myself in
And you stuck by a nigga like my left hand
It wasn't all this at first, till we just kept prayin
Now I'm on-and you a bad ass bitch, Yes maam
And oh yes maam as soon as I get home it's gon'be work time
And you know us we like to fuck like it's the first time
You tell the first time for some reason
I knew that I was stayin'and I figured you wasn't leavin
I know that I don't need ya, but be feelin like I need ya
When it come to certain people, I act like I got a meetin'
But I just wanna please ya-trust me they just wanna be ya
Whenever I ain't wit ya baby I can't wait to see ya
I gotta keep it G and say I love ya, cause I'm fuh real
I wash away all the tears, we been doin this shit for years

(Chorus-Le'Toya)
Since you went away, I been down and lonely
Since you went away, I been thinkin of you
Ooooooh I'm missin you, Ooooooh I'm missin you

[Bridge-Le'Toya)
Ya everything I need, couldn't have asked for more
Boy you know you were, waitin for
I know you wonder why I'm standin at the door
To let you know, I miss you
And you will see it in my eyes
You're the completion to my life
Ain't even a question, you already know
But I remind you that, I miss you

(Chorus-Le'Toya till end)
