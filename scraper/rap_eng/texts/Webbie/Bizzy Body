[Verse 1: Webbie]
Black Lac, hat back, fat killa bag of that california wit a Pocahontas with a fat cat
Fat back she got a ol' mane but we ain't sweatin that
A fat stack will make them heatas eat em like a big mac
Suckin on my nuts and shit
Rubbin on my six pack
My finger in her butt and shit
Now she bustin nuts and shit
Long dick fold her up
She feel it in her guts and just
Take it out fix thae strap and tell her ass to switch positions
She a bizzy body so you know I gotta keep her bizzy
Bring her to the clique and let her suck dick until she get dizzy
She can leave I ain't trippin I was finna put her out
Call another bizzy body, brang her in and work her out
Hop up in my big body swerve it out 2 the house
To my main boo hide the rubbers turn my phone off
Make love to her that's my girl so we zone out
Go to sleep wake up in the morning and bust on out

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
Now she say that she really want a playa
But she neva on her best behavior
Cuz she always shakin what her mama gave her
But all she really want from me is that paper

'Cause she a bizzy body (bizzy body) [x8]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Lil mama off the chain thowed from her head to toe
Working the head bob she swallow it and neva choke
All I wanna do is smoke all she wanna do is fuck
She don't love me she just here cause I got some bucks
When we done with her that broad gone be on her way
Back 2 the hood bitch I see that ass anotha day
That girl get around all work no play
She stay on ha knees but trust me she ain't there to pray
She want a playa with paper to come save her and move her downtown to a high rise sky scraper
Put that thang on me till I can't even walk
Right now she got her mouth full so baby can't talk, hey
She stay bizzy all day from gettin' bizzy
Lil mama is out of control just like missy
Straight up bizzy body that girl is a dime
And I've been fuckin with her for a long time baby

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
Now she say that she really want a playa
But she neva on her best behavior
Cuz she always shakin what her mama gave her
But all she really want from me is that paper

'Cause she a bizzy body (bizzy body) [x8]

[Verse 3: Mouse]
La di da di, I need a bizzy body
Who gone ride that dick like a new maserati
Moan and groan she can't keep silent
Kick both legs in the air like karate (waaaah)
She a motor mouth when I'm up inside it
Perky lips perky nips she so exotic
She got that body like a hot diamond
She really get to actin off a couple gin tonics
Beside all that she work full time and independent
She don't need a nigga to help her with dick
She got her own cheese and own a business (Them hoes hate her)
Big ballers in the city (won't date her)
She know bout my baby momma (still faithful)
If you holla she gone say that (she taken)
I gotta baby mammi and a bizzy body

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
Now she say that she really want a playa
But she neva on her best behavior
Cuz she always shakin what her mama gave her
But all she really want from me is that paper

'Cause she a bizzy body (bizzy body) [x8]
