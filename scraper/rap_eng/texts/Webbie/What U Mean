What you mean, what you mean
I ain't feel what you mean
I ain't feel how you feel
What you mean what you mean?
What you saying, what you saying
What it is what you saying
What it is, what it is
What you saying, what you saying?
How you feel, how you feel
What you may, what you may

I heard somebody looking for me?
Triple deal O.D
I'm still right here
In the middle of the heat
Keep real while playing
In the middle of the street
What it gonna be?
If you got it on your mind
I don't really don't need it
The place and the time
I'm from the army
You and me, we play rowdy
Me and A-Town, we can do it like that
You wanna know what I've been doing lately?
I just stayed up to celebrate D
Take me aside right before your right boyfriend
I'm real, you haters, I brought my nuts
Sell a couple of Bemzez, couple of years in the pen
And all my friends, they all gotta play it
I'm just saying what y'all are thinking
So fuck you all and all your friends!

Figgiding right and the casket grow
Then get your big nick by the bad ass ho
Know what I'm saying, no, right, let me tell you
Wanna tell you a little bit of what I found, though
Tell me about it, I'm way about it
When I holler, make me come talk to
Some of that beef shit I eat that
But I'm bleeding all out

What you mean, what you mean
I ain't feel what you mean
I ain't feel how you feel
What you mean what you mean?
What you saying, what you saying
What it is what you saying
What it is, what it is
What you saying, what you saying?
How you feel, how you feel
What you may, what you may

They throw a lot of swirls
And the guy in the splurge
They sliding when I see 'em
They don't say nothing
They've got a lot of peep
And the real, I'mma sure they
Don't want in a motherfucker
Now, ain't that something?
Hey, I'm buzzing, now
Ain't you gonna tell me?
I am B.T., you gonna allow your branch?
Sneaking on a nigga, well, it ain't no thing

I've got a man colded out, white like cocaine
You feel so wet and I feel so fine
Man, he'll smoke and pray for the rain
A wide flow and the Glock glow
Free little bee under my toe
You taking it all on a shopping spree
Not for me, that's fine, ho
You cross me and you die, ho!
Put your head on a high bowl!
All I know is be guilty
I fuck like it's a big a deal
Want to pick at me
Is you blind, nigga?
It ain't about that, stop lying, nigga!
I'm a dick to the gangsters here
Ain't no rehab, they can't help me
I'm so crazy and so wealthy
Do you smell me, stay for Nelly!

What you mean, what you mean
I ain't feel what you mean
I ain't feel how you feel
What you mean what you mean?
What you saying, what you saying
What it is what you saying
What it is, what it is
What you saying, what you saying?
How you feel, how you feel
What you may, what you may

Thrill nigga, look, man!
You understand that I am the game
Like an animal. Got no remorse
You can't explain. I show you, though
And I know you know, got a hydro
On my nice role, got a T.V. on my El Paso
I knee niggers at my toe
Nigga, I ain't got no vato
Nigga trying to get what I been had
Came here with no lights on
My python, I talk shit and I'm iron
I'm lighting them up like a paizan
Like J.J. in New York, we're casing
Fucking wholes. The daybreak, be right back
Go make cake. Get me straight, my enemies running late
I constantly get elate. Yes
I'm a big bitches bait
I'm that nigga, make no mistake
Who round before I regulate
Think 'fo you say what you say
Bitch, all I can do is pray

What you mean, what you mean
I ain't feel what you mean
I ain't feel how you feel
What you mean what you mean?
What you saying, what you saying
What it is what you saying
What it is, what it is
What you saying, what you saying?
How you feel, how you feel
What you may, what you may
