ILike to count my money backwards... it's faster

We weight her up and then we wrap her... go ask her
And watch me move her like casper... like casper

[Verse 1:]
I'm blowin smoke up in the wind. flyin down I-10

Triple stacks right here, so fuck it, man let's roll

Listened to Jeezy music now I trap like this

[Webbie:]
I ain't from here Atlanta, but I be trappin all the time
I done got to that lil point where money ain't even a good thang
So you might just catch me in the fuckin hottest crippin clubs
Poppin bottles throwin cake at potential models with my thugs
They was thankin I was wrong when I pulled up in my maybach
You'll think I was obama, I run shit like the president
I commit so many sins, I need to go see Reverend
I be prayin everyday, don't know what's up in front me
The police up at my door, make me wish I was a ghost
I jus found out on the low, that my lil nigga a ho
Ian even gon say no names, I'm jus gon go let that shit go
All I smoke is that good doja ion smoke mary no more

[Verse 3: Phat]
I count it backwards it's faster, like a money machine
I'm a countin money bastard, I'm countin in my sleep
You can catch me at tha studio, no shows for bouht a week
Yes I'm out for bouht a week so I'm a need about a tree
For them niggas who be rappin, but still be trappin
I am not a rapper, I'm a trapper, I be magic
I'm from Baton Rouge but I'm in ATL stackin
I'm Murci√©lago stuntin, that's 100 bricks of traffic
Mi niggas right behind me and they hollin we tha baddest
We give her dope dick, then wrap her in plastic
And watch me move em like I'm casper
You want a brick from me you gotta count yo money backwards
