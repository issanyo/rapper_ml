Anothe one, another one set on
I'm in the way and stand on the police way
They kill the ? that's what they see ?
They finelty come alone and waiting for the ?
And you better stay about the motherfuceker way

Refrigerate ? you stand inside the way
What the fuck bro which one you try to hate
Get it off bro with you ?
