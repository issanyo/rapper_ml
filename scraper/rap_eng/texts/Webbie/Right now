I'ma chase this cheese right now
And I'ma be straight by the time I stop
I'm on my grind getting loose
And I'ma be rich by the time I'm through
I gotta drop my nuts and make this run
A million plus by the time I'm done
Left the bullshit alone
Gotta handle this business
Its gone be on by the time I'm finished

I'm from baton rouge but ain't no such thang as handouts
If you don't hustle you don't stand out hands down
Nigga my nuts dropped that's why my pants down
Paper by any means and I ain't playin' round
Either you stand up or stand down its on you
I'ma get this money you can be broke if you want to
I wasn't rapping I'd be jacking these niggas up
While chillin' wit niggas up in [?]
Man I ain't tryna lose weight I gotta eat this lunch
And don't like [?] up put me in the front
Put the weed in the blunt tryna think of what to do next
The police be picking up all my niggas wonder who next
Somebody must be talking or something
If you a rat stay away cause you ain't walkin' or something
My mine been clogged up all I been thinking is money
So I put on my pants laced my shoes and fuck it

Ima chase this cheese right now
And I'ma be straight by the time I stop
I'm on my grind getting loose
And I'ma be rich by the time I'm through
I gotta drop my nuts and make this run
A million plus by the time I'm done
Left the bullshit alone
Gotta handle this business
Its gone be on by the time I'm finished

I'ma be richer than a motherfuker by next year
Somebody mama dying when I shed no tears
Listen playa listen up cause the youngin don't give a fuck
Tryna run me dawg tryna come between my buck
So stupid ass nigga tell me what drugs you on
Don't know who the fuck you dissin on a song
2009 these niggas lamer than a bitch
You used to be my nigga but changed like a bitch
Put the stop signs up cause I'm still gon run through em
You nigga pussy you ain't gon do nothing to em
Money ain't a thang making real niggas bitches
So you can keep the thang the money I'm still gon get it
Murda murda kill kill I swear I'm still with it
I just want the money them niggas is still petty
Ambulance dead he in there dead now
You you ain't never did it don't fuck wit my bread now

I'ma chase this cheese right now
And I'ma be straight by the time I stop
I'm on my grind I'm getting loose
And I'ma be rich by the time I'm through
I gotta drop my nuts and make this run
A million plus by the time I'm done
Left the bullshit alone
Gotta handle this business
Its gone be on by the time I'm finished

By the age of 25 I'ma be the man
Got dreams of becoming the biggest nigga in the land
I'd like a heater think I need a fan
I'm all about the business ain't got time for the plan
Right now I'm straight but I need more
I'm talking a million plus in a bank account offshore
I believe that I can be all I can be
Houses in Atlanta couple of them in Miami
You can be hella poor so I wanna be mad rich
I'ma let them hate and show the world I'm the baddest
No I don't feel speical but I'm higher than average
See me I'm getting loosebut loose in the mind
See I grind every night so I'm destined to shine
Left the biz behind so show me where the money
After I make this run I'm coming back with a couple mil in cash
When so when the cops get a lighter I'ma get a dash

I'ma chase this cheese right now
And I'ma be straight by the time I stop
I'm on my grind I'm getting loose
And I'ma be rich by the time I'm through
I gotta drop my nuts and make this run
A million plus by the time I'm done
Left the bullshit alone
Gotta handle this business
Its gone be on by the time I'm finished
