So you say you wanna be my bitch
But do you know all of the shit that it its gone take to be my bitch
Can you value what you miss, when we're on the paper chase like this
Can you do all of them tricks on that? ha
Girl is you ready to live this savage life
Do you really deserve to be one of my savage wives
Bitch I made it, so you know I got my hands tied
But I also know that you're pretty yeah your ass wide

And I know you're kind of own and I smell like weed cologne
Won't you come give me them digits I'ma call you later on
She say ooo, nu uh, you ain't callin' me at all
'cause that boy be so pissed off and he stay checkin' my phone
How 'bout I give you a number? You call me later on
It can't be my real number, c'mon you know I'm a dog
As long as we hook up, just keep it on the hush

Lie to the man, told em I'm gonna see my people boo
I ? we ducked off for like a week or two

Took a shower and showed me all the things she been through
Got in her head and told her all the things that we can do
We can take over the whole world girl me and you
Told me 'bout her problem then I told her I can see her through
Another bad bitch this what trill niggas do
So all these haters keep on hating
And I'll be making hoes wait on my dick til they get tired of waiting
Bend her over, put it in her, it be hurting, make her take it
So she can't take it no more, for real

Tell that boy you're bout to go out with your home girl
Then come to me and I can treat you like my own girl
Touch you like my own girl, take you round my home boy
And can take you by the house and let you check out my four car garage
And put her on a pedaltal, then I let that hoe massage
All up on my back, licked on my nut and then I f*cked her hard
Hey baby what you doing she say nothing watching kids
Put they ass to sleep, I'm coming through I want some f*cking head
I'm like the nothing and nigga fade, just look and I know the nigga fake
And may be fake and they'll be hating when I ain't around
Take a ride in round town, with the top down
With the music go loud, pull her pants down, dick her down
Chillin want the ground, you can go and check my back ground
Got love for this down hoe keep it on the down low
See my down chick and I'm a down
We do this every time she get away from that clown dude

I feel like being sneaky, picky
We can, keep it 'tween me and you girl its gone be our little secret
Sneaky picky, we can keep it 'tween me and you girl its gone be our little secret
