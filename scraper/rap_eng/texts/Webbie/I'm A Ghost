[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]

Bury me back across the track, with my name on the wall
Nigga how you love that, Feel this
Keep all my niggas strapped down when we hit the club doe
Teach all my niggas in the bottom not to love hoes
Got a real killa who'll come get you like Candyman
?I ride in big Ram trucks I don't do Avalanche?
??????????????????? just don't get a chance to do me like my nigga Tys'
When it's on I bring a 40 and some head bustas
Fed duckas, Known killers so they scared of us
And Christmas time and Thanksgivin ain't the same no mo
Since I done lost my ?lil woe on this gangsta joke?
But when we touch I'm gon' be famous, with a lot of bread
And ????? we gon' get heads you know how we play it
Listen here when I rap and I can show you boys I'm not a dream peepin my knowledge
All you seein is the violence, Don't you always hear sirens up in the hood? (Yeah)
Don't them boys that be wildin up in the hood? (Yeah)
And you can bury me a G, Mama wipe your tears
But one day I gotta disappear and I'mma be a ghost

[Hook]

I can't stop it when God's knockin
So you can bury me a G
I got the police looking for me
But to them I'm a G-H-O-S-T

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]

Behind Trill I'mma die for it, Fuck tryin for it
And you know I gotta ride for it nigga
And I'm back and I'm all faded
All over soldier with a brain that keeps on elevatin
And them bitch ass niggas up on my team, Yeah they turned on me
They talked behind my back squeal like a worm homie
It's my turn homie, That platinum plaque I feel I earned homie
But I ain't gonna feel it till my records get some turns homie
Many men wish death on me so I told 40 Glocks
Nigga I need my whole life I gotta torture now
You know what's up with me
I'm OG, rest in peace Soulja Slim nigga
Look this life as a rap star is nothin without guard
The livin ain't really hard but bullets rip you apart
You think I'm pussy test a pussy you gon' catch a pussy
In the top of yo head now that's an extra pussy
I run with convicts, lawyers, even college grads
I roll with ex poppers then niggas on them body bags
You fuck with Boosie I'mma show you where the choppas at
But one day I'mma be a ghost they still gon' holla that

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Webbie]

You hear me rippin Pac's shit up
Grippin the Glock, Spittin
And willing to knock any nigga out there trippin
I'm just young sick ya either love it or hate it
I came up strugglin, hatin but I've been thuggin and made it
In their discussion they bring me up all the time
Cause it's hard to find a nigga hard as mine
I'mma break a brick down to all the dimes
So my cake'll flip now I get all of mines
