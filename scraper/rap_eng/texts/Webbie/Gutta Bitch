Look hop in my ride, stash this, hold that
Be cool turn the sound up and roll that
Now you my gutta bitch, lil' momma don't get it twisted
No trippin', no house visits you know I got other bitches
I mean it's plain and clear I'm a motherfucking player
Don't worry about your teammates long as you straight and taken care of
Look here don't worry about me boo, just worry 'bout you
Follow my player ass rules and everything will go smooth
Just wait for me I'll be back I ain't gone be gone long bruh
Gotta make a couple rounds hold it down while I'm gone
This some gutta ass G shit girl I can't tell you I love you
But you ain't just another ho I kinda got feelings for ya
You just play you your part right don't slip and stay focused
Somebody might get laid off and you might get promoted
Been thuggin' like you suppose to, real to me vice versa
I know you won't get close, it ain't the time don't take it personal

[Hook]

[Webbie]
I'm a hustler
I ain't got much quality time to spend on what I'm saying
And then I'm split it in 10's
So like a man I'mma come but soon as I come in
Let me beat it cause ain't no telling when I'mma be leaving again
That's just me, that's how I play it
I lay the pole and roll
Cause I know no money trucks come to front doors
Now don't go and get it wrong
Thinking I'm actin funny
I can't give you to much time shit time is money
And if my main boo, knew
You just don't know what she'll do to you
Ooh she might go off and get to shootin' you so on the real

[Webbie]
See, you got a old man, I respect that
I ain't even gonna check that
Real shit and I expect to get the same shit back
You catch me and my old lady
Riding in my Cadillac
I don't wanna horn or honk
I don't want a smile to crack
You do that shit and I bet you that, we ain't gon' be smiling back
We might just swerve on yo ass straight up try to handle that
All right, you fucking Webbie
No need for reppin'
I wanna fuck her too so don't even tell ya best friend
Talking all that gangsta shit, really don't impress me
Keeping it on the down low, then I'll be impressed then
Don't even tell your damn self
It ain't nobody's business
What we do, where we go, how we come, where we been
