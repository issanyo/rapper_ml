And i ain't goin home until everythang gone it dont neva take long
I keep orders on my phone
Wit a sick click wit me wit a big clip wit me
Wit dat good white pretty big zip 650
Im da eat on da streets a beast on da beats
Da puzzle to the peice dey need to make dis industry complete
Ill run it so neat, so fresh, so clean
I can go on any street no vest wearin bling
Im trill young savage i do my thing straight no king no prince no queen
And imma leave it right dea
Wish a nigga get crunk
I ain't shootin no curves no slurs straight pumps

(Chorus)
