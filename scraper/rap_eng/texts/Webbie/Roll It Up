[Hook]
Break it down pass it round let it smoke dog
Make her go down make her choke like a whole pound
Of that kush it be sealed up before it touch down
It’s all on you and all I do
(Roll it up, light it up)
Got some gin and some juice
And we smokin on Snoop
(Roll it up, light it up)
Blunts fat like a log, hoes tell me I'm a dog
(Roll it up, light it up)
I keep money and in my paws of that marijuana dog
(Roll it up, light it up)
Smoke up, we smoke all up

[Verse 1]
I been smoking since the sixth grade kill it in the bathroom
Teacher wasn’t tripping she just put me out the classroom
We was smoking residue and whatever we had to
To get another bag of that gag and some fast food
Couldn’t roll the best blunts I ain’t go lie
But the clique wasn’t tripping long as we got high
Graduated to some papers and a few four fives
None of us crossed the stage but we still got by
Had to hustle had to grind turned a nickel to a dime
Now I keep it in the air by pound at a time
I fucks with a few niggas don’t smoke with new niggas
And I burn I’m that killer me and Snoop Dogg chillin

[Hook]
Break it down pass it round let it smoke dog
Make her go down make her choke like a whole pound
Of that kush it be sealed up before it touch down
It’s all on you and all I do
(Roll it up, light it up)
Got some gin and some juice
And we smokin on Snoop
(Roll it up, light it up)
Blunts fat like a log, hoes tell me I'm a dog
(Roll it up, light it up)
I keep money in my paws of that marijuana dog
(Roll it up, light it up)

[Verse 2]
Little did she know i had a big bag of dope
But I wouldn’t try to share it with no one
In the kitchen, in the kitchen
Only mission cooking fish and
Cause it takes one to know one
So grow one, off and running
Stunting, a villain and dealing the four [?]
The money life, dripping from the sky
Fucking with the fire and the fire got him hella high
Let it go, now pull it back
Put it in the air with the aphrodisiac
In the cadillac rollin with my nephew
Step to bless you, aww nigga F you
Blaze up

[Hook]
Break it down pass it round let it smoke dog
Make her go down make her choke like a whole pound
Of that kush it be sealed up before it touch down
It’s all on you and all I do
(Roll it up, light it up)
Got some gin and some juice
And we smokin on Snoop (say what)
(Roll it up, light it up)
You smoking on that motherfuckin Snoop Dogg
Blunts fat like a log, hoes tell me I'm a dog
(Roll it up, light it up) Yes sir, that's me baby
I keep money in my paws of that marijuana dog
(Roll it up, light it up)

[Bridge]

Nephew you know what it do
From the N.O to the L.B.C
It’s what we been knew
Yep, roll it up

[Hook]
Break it down pass it round let it smoke dog
Make her go down make her choke like a whole pound
Of that kush it be sealed up before it touch down
It’s all on you and all I do
(Roll it up, light it up)
Got some gin and some juice
And we smokin on Snoop

(Roll it up, light it up)
Blunts fat like a log, hoes tell me I'm a dog
