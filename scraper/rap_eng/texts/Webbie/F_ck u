Verse 3:
I'm chillin' up in Georgia with my intelligent lawyer chick
She got her own lil office
We be all up in her drawer with this
She say it be hard to get away from her dumb husband
Say she think she startin to love me
And i make her wanna divorce him
And it ain't about my fortune
And it ain't about my fame
I didn't even referee her i just let her run her game
I just play like a by leader
Told her she what i been needin' for completion
I don't need no other woman all i need is you
Said it like i meant it then i hit it like that shit was true (bang bang bang)
Get it from my uncles trill forever shout out to lil boosie
