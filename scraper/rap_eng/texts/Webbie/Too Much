You're too much, you're too much
You're too much, you're too much

I thought I'd came through later on when you're home alone
And you don't have nothing on, just your thong alone
We can open up some bottles, we can roll up a zone
Or we can get straight to the point and we can getting it on
She mad, she say I visit her wrong and every time she hit me up I never pick up the phone
I told her, 'Listen, baby, girl, I've been missing, you're gone
But 'on my agenda, I've been getting along'
You go to sleep in them expensive gowns
I must admit she really one of the baddest bitches around
I thought if she independent know how bitches get down
She probably is, I don't ever see no niggas around
Probably 'cause she done figured it out'the bullshit, know what niggas about
'get a job, just wanna sit in your home, I tell her I'm a different fella, come on, listen me out
You know the time pass when you're having fun or don't
Fine ass, you been tripping me off

She hotter than a devil, on another level
I ain't wanna sweat here, really all that I could tell her was
You're too much, you're too much
You're too much, you're too much
She hotter than a devil, on another level
I ain't wanna sweat here, really all that I could tell her was

You're too fine so every time you slide through
Everybody gotta look at least two times
I don't play crazy'playing hard to get but I'mma get mad due time
The lady got her own cheddar, she don't need mine
I don't need hers so don't matter, we both fine
I stand back and I look better from both sides
High born, bad bitch, we both fine
Now it ain't just for that ass kiss that does shine
Better cop a dime, as it is it's gonna be stroke time
Hit the club, ice up, white silk'when I spot her up in no time
She can bag it up like she ain't got no spine
Quite and leave a broke ass nigga like a clothes line
She don't want an old man, says she got her own self
'girl, you know you something else
On some whole other shit, way, way out of here
You ain't gotta say a thing, it's already clear

You're too much, you're too much
You're too much, you're too much

She hotter than a devil, on another level
I ain't wanna sweat here, really all that I could tell her was

I ain't gonna lie, you a bad bitch and you marry but I'm the savage
I talk a lot of shit but I can bag it, might get you whine first, I make you come first
I make you feel good when it don't feel right
And even though it's wrong, I make it feel right
And you ain't never cheated but you still might
I say we go and cop a firestorm and live life

She hotter than a devil, on another level
I ain't wanna sweat here, really all that I could tell her was
You're too much, you're too much
You're too much, you're too much
She hotter than a devil, on another level
I ain't wanna sweat here, really all that I could tell her was
You're too much, you're too much
You're too much, you're too much
