(feat. Big Head)

[Introduction: Webbie]
Trill ent Young Savage
If it don't make dolla's it don't make sense
I'm just doing what I do when I do what I do Nobody do it better nobody
If it ain't purple it ain't smoking right

[Verse 1:]
I don't know what's finna happen tomorrow
But Growing up in dem hoods
All a ni**a can do is hope it'll be good
Him, big head dats my thug [? ]
So where you art (I'm in da hood) just stay dere I'll through it
When I'm riding it's high 18 ft Or some hit with some heat
Told my peeps I'm a die in these streets
I'm a million dolla ni**a why am I in these streets?
I don't know ni**a shittt I got love in these streets
8th grade found a plug in em and I ain't turn back
Ain't no love in em thugs gonna have to learn dat
I'm a tell ya'll da real doe money what we here foe!
Cause say he was coming home Monday, dat was a year ago
Tell me stop I blow, My tolerance is real low
If it wasn't fo baby bopper I woulda died from pounds a some years ago
Young savage I be hearing you doe, You got some tigger in you doe
Nigga sounding like you on da cool but I don't know

[Chorus:]
I make it just so sick dat dey gotta (bite my shit)
Man I got so many hoes and bit*ches (like my dick)
Man I ain't neva gon stop it's just like pimpin (just like dis)
And get it (just like dis) and win it (jus like dis)
[x2]

[Verse 2:]
I ain't neva had shit but dis rap wish
Big whips but no money fo da chap stick
But I was real since a ni**a hit backflips
I'm real in thugin I don't need no practice
[? ]m Girls under the mattress
Start Fuckin a bitch look like a actress
I workin for da magnum stead of plastic
Everywhere I go I got hoes so attracted
Don't be hatin jus be brave and get yo ass whipped
I'm a bust him if his ass trip

[Chorus:]
I make it just so sick dat dey gotta (bite my shit)
Man I got so many hoes and bit*ches (like my dick)
Man I ain't neva gon stop it's just like pimpin (just like dis)
And get it (just like dis) and win it (jus like dis)
