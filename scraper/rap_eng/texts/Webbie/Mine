I can't eat unless it's mine
I on it, that bitch's mine
Please don't disrespect what's mine
You best have it on your mind

I've been doing this for some time
Put mine all on the line
Every time I get a dime
I fuck it like it's mine

That came from nothing, little mind
I'm through hustling, no crime
Came out hugging, 05
Really thugging, no lies

Stop talking, I'm riding on you walking
In the game, still balling
Clearly, I went through some losses
I can't complain. I'm breathing

So keep hating for no reason
Different spouses every week-end
Other houses every season
I probably take her home

And let her get her smurf on
The sweet's on, and I know
I still got shit to work on

But I'm gonna say this mine
I call my grand-ma' mine
I be with my mind to mind
Really, my ol'lady mine
They gon'talk, but I don't mind
Like I don't have no mind
Yeah, all my jury mine
Whole amnesia, blurry mind

But I'm gonna say this mine
I call my grand-ma' mine
I be with my mind to mind
Really, my ol'lady mine
They gon'talk, but I don't mind
Like I don't have no mind
Yeah, all my jury mine
Whole amnesia, blurry mind

And I sound like my mind
I got diamonds get you blind
Have I ever asked yu for a verse, no
Forget it, I don't mind
'cause I don't need your high life
True family, I've got mine
My whole ? getting you
Help me, no help you?! No, yes, I do
You fuck your wife for me
Friends wage their life for me
Offer all this shit for me
And the other half for Lil' P
Eh, no, yeah, my top of mind
I don't wait inside no line
They saw anybody cross the line?
I can say, no, that ain't mine!
I ain't selfish, I'm just keppling
I believe in devils
I know they'll take me away for ever
Ever ever
What you see here is mine
Savage life for life
And I don't have no time to waist time

My new Mercedes's mine
I call my grand-ma' mine
I be with my mind to mind
Really, my ol'lady mine
They gon'talk, but I don't mind
Like I don't have no mind
Yeah, all my jury mine
Whole amnesia, blurry mind

That's why all these dollars' mine
And all these bottles' mine
I'm a walking dollar sign?
I like my business fine
I got fire, kid, blaze
I got all my bills payed
Through these dollar dollar safes
It look like I got them made
I gotta go to see my all
I got a house that's not my home
And it's for my Libu 4
You look like you need a loan
I've got charters and lawyers
I'm working hard for my daughters
All my niggers keep throbbing
I swear this shit be like poison

My new Mercedes's mine
Your new old lady's mine
Yeah, don't disrespect my mind
I give a shout out for my grand-ma
You know I love you, mine
Gon'be a thriller, gonna do it
And I'mma make that mine
I'll take my toys, what is mine
Keep God on my side
And with that, be a man
You'll be fine

The resorts, keep 'em tight
Dimple soldiers, know it's right
Just a piece of my advice
Feel good for life

My new Mercedes's mine
I call my grand-ma' mine
I be with my mind to mind
Really, my ol'lady mine
They gon' talk, but I don't mind
Like I don't have no mind
Yeah, all my jury mine
Whole amnesia, blurry mind
