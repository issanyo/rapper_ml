[Verse 1]
Everybody that I have round me worth sum
Had a murk some & need church in em
I ain't looking for no love cause it hurt fuck it
I'll probably flirt or something take off your skirt or something
If I don't know you walk light around my turf
Cause you'll probably slip or stumble over a gun fight or somethin'
No discussion niggas bussing aiming for ya head
Qhat the fuck
Man my nigga dead
Kill em as soon as I see em up in broad day
Pissed off like I had a very hard day
Turn the other cheek
Swear that's what the lord say
Hard headed ni**as got to learn the HARD way

[Hook]
Who ya wit?
Who ya wit?
Who ya wit?...

[Verse 2]
You know, you bout it bout it then show me
Locked out and smoked out y'all know how I'm rollin'
Ask the streets nigga they ain't feelin' ole boy
My partner say when he get home he killin' ole boy
I told him watch it through the phone man just leave that alone
He say man soon as I get home bruh that nigga gone
You ain't gon' smoke chill and fuck a couple hoes first
Savage look I ain't even go change clothes first
Eye em down make sure i tell him he a hoe first
His nose first make em fall like his toes hurt
I can't trust ima bust till i can't bust
If you ain't with us then what the fuck

[Hook]
Who ya wit
Who ya wit
Who ya wit...

[Verse 3]
I heard somebody say they was lookin' for me
Man all that runnin' shit pussy to me
Man look all u gotta do is tell me where to meet you at
You need God I'ma send u where the preacher at
Savage life to the death
Oh they can't hear shit
I'm still here with the same people i came here with
And I'm with them to the dust through the cuts and the fuss
No matter how it go I'ma keep it 100 plus
I'm Snatching these hoes
Make sure they keep a crush
Tellin' me they love me but i know its really lust
So turn the speakers up
Cause yeah its really us
The trill fam baby we ain't never had a cut

[Hook]
Who ya wit
Who ya wit
Who ya wit...
