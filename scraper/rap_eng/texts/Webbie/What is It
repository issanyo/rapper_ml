[Hook 2x]
Is it my car, is it my clothes
That make these hoes want fuck fa sho
Is it my style, the way I roll
That make these haters want hate some mo

[Verse 1]
Is it that fifth that I drank
When I'm in my whip with the fresh ass paint
That make these hoes wanna look in my face
That make these niggas wanna be in my place
Or tell me is it my shows that cost 300
That make me have to go to everywhere but church with a gun
Would make a nigga wanna hate my mama son
Maybe it's my style, just the way I come
Or maybe it's these hoes that I done beats
Or maybe it's your sister or your niece
Or how I rock my bauds with no crease
Or how I'm just so throwed and off the leash
Or tell me is it these shoes on my feet
And how they matching my fits so perfectly
That make a hater wanna go up out they way on me
Nigga I don't even know you wanna hate on me

[Hook 2x]
Is it my car, is it my clothes
That make these hoes want fuck fa sho
Is it my style, the way I roll
That make these haters want hate some mo

[Verse 2]
Is it my bitch if it is which one
My lil' bitch up in the city or the one in the country
Or how a nigga so hot - number 1 in the country
Ever since I did it big, big money, big stuntin'
Or is my niggas big fam, Bun B
Yeah y'all don't like hearing me with UG Kings
Or tell me is it my looks that make your ho scream
And have her mouth all wet and wanna suck on me
Or tell me is that screen that she see inside
When I be high, rolling by that make her wanna ride
Or tell me is it my style, how I'm just so fly
How a nigga so wild plus I'm on right now
Tell me is it my hood, how that bitch roll
365 - 24 with them quarters and O's
Or how I holla at my people fo they get you some mo
Handling business with the beeper to avoid them folks

[Hook 2x]
Is it my car, is it my clothes
That make these hoes want fuck fa sho
Is it my style, the way I roll
That make these haters want hate some mo

[Verse 3]
Is it my cake or my bundles of crack
Or how I made this hit quick, Mannie Fresh on the track
Or is it the platinum plaque I'm about to snatch
Cause you know I signed a deal and it's my turn to act
Or what them big 24's on that brand new Lac
Or yo lil' dog ass ho took this dick from the back
Or my fire ass flow - niggas want my raps
What it is, I don't know that make 'em act like that
Probably because these lil' cats out here know I'm a dog
And the closet at the house starting to look like a mall
What it is, got 'em trippin' my expensive cologne
This XO, or the purple dro I blow by the zone
Or is it cause my nigga head ain't got too long
Yeah you when he get home it's gone really be on
Or is it the quarter sale - hit me now on the phone
Whats wrong, why this vibe that I'm feeling so strong

[Hook 2x]
Is it my car, is it my clothes
That make these hoes want fuck fa sho
Is it my style, the way I roll
That make these haters want hate some mo
