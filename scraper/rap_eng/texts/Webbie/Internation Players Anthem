I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Saying that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I see see every girl that I see see around town
I hate to see yall frown but I rather see her smile
Wetness all around me, true
But I'm no island
Penniless maybe
Makes no since, I know, crazy
Give up all this pussycat that's in my lap, no looking back
Space ships, don't come equip, with the rear view mirrors
They dip
As quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp
I'm Gladdis Night, soldier light
From the sun will not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a preemy out the womb
My partner yelling "too soon don't do it! Reconsider read some lither."
Sure you on the subject, You sure? Fuck it
You know we got ya back like chiroprac
Tick if that bitch do you dirty
We'll wash her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry
G'on to the alter
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught you
Keep ya heart 3 stacks, keep yo heart, aye
Keep yo heart 3 stacks, keep yo heart
Man these girls is smart 3 stacks these is smart
Play ya part

Nigga Pimp C taught me not to fuck without a rubber
Later on the sheets I nutted all over the cover
Diamonds on the dresser
Hit her with the pressure
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
You know me I fuck a forty thousand in the club
Fuckin up the game, bitch you gets no love
High to the sky blowing pounds of the pot
A thousand a pot I'm pulling Bentley's off the lot
I smash with a gray what
Bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose me
But they too scary
Rest in peace Pops
Trillest nigga ever buried
