I come up hard baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it sugar, playin' by the rules
I come up hard baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sugar, movin' down the line
I come up hard baby, but that's okay
'Cause trouble man, don't get in my way
I come up hard baby, I've been for real
Gonna keep movin', gonna go to town
I come up hard baby, I'm gettin' down
There's only three things that for sure
Taxes, death and trouble

This I know, baby
This I know, sugar
Girl, I ain't gon' let it sweat me, baby
Got me singin'
Yeah , yeah, whoa
I come up hard
I've had to fight
Take care of my business
With all my might
I come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over, and win again
I come up hard, but that's okay
'Cause trouble man
Don't get in my way
I know some places and I've seen some faces
I've got good connections they dig in my directions
What people say that's okay
They don't bother me

Ready to make it, don't fool with no women
Don't care 'bout no trouble got myself together
I feel a kind of protection is all around me
This I know baby
Girl, I ain't gonna let it sweat me, baby
I come up hard, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it sugar, playin' by the rules
I come up hard baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sugar
Movin' down the line
