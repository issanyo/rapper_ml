[Intro]
Na na na na na na na naaaa!
Sweet John
Savage life
Remember that, you already know

[Pre-Hook]
Beat it up for breakfast, plus dick you on a lunch date
Show up at yo job and fuck you on your lunch break
Dick you down for dinner, all you need is one plate
Got a man but just remember one thing

[Hook]
He don’t beat that pussy like I do, like i do and
He don’t treat that pussy like I do, like i do and
He don’t beat that pussy like I do, like i do and
He don’t treat that pussy like I do, like i do

[Verse 1]
Forget what happened in the past before what the future holds
Now I'ma beat that pussy hard stick it all up in your soul
You know how fast time pass I mean where you wanna go
Let me fulfill all your dreams I’m trying fill every hole
We bout to do this shit again
We all [?] this shit before
We all wait to [?] before
Caught up in the fast life ain’t got time to take it slow
You know all I know is smoke
Money cars clothes hoes
Think I’m a hoe boy you already know we can do it right now
Ahhh wow!
When she asked me for some pay i said naaa ahh
Trill fam niggas finna come now
So man look if you ain’t with us better run now
We wasted i’m wasting on her tongue now
Work her like i’m really tryna hurt her
She screaming wait big boy you got the biggest hot dick
She about to blow up like a bomb

[Pre-Hook]
Beat it up for breakfast, plus dick you on a lunch date
Show up at yo job and fuck you on your lunch break
Dick you down for dinner, all you need is one plate
Got a man but just remember one thing

[Hook]
He don’t beat that pussy like I do, like i do and
He don’t treat that pussy like I do, like I do and
He don’t beat that pussy like I do, like I do and
He don’t treat that pussy like I do, like I do

[Verse 2]
It beat her hard ass in the morning breakfast get retarded
Lunch dinner like a snack is gonna be good regardless
And if you ever see me with her that bitch gonna be flawless
You probably seen me with her once or i be switching up
And I love all ma bad bitches ain’t gonna even lie
But I ain’t loving these hoes so don’t even try
With the way that pussy sweat i call her hot sauce
And i ain’t gotta break a sweat to get in my thoughts
So what i’m saying girl is stop playing girl
Leave you that little boy alone get you a man girl
He’ll understand I’m a man and this a man’s world
If he a player better tell him we can do it right

Na na na na na naaa
