[Verse 1: Lil Phat]
Air Force Ones, I Need A Size 10 501's Levi's Stick In
My Levi's Be Dope, My G-Nikes Be Coke
Like Everywhere I Got, I'm Pulling All Yo Hoes
Tha Veddy Niggah Whilin I Be Shinin I Be Clean
I Be Fresh And I Be Dumb Like Everytime I Hit Da Scene
I'm Still In My Teens But My Whip A Hundred G's
Doin 200 From B.R. To New Orleans
Before I Was On Em, Ross Was Pluckin Levi's
I Saw Em With Em In Miami And Dey Caught My Eyes
Hit Tha Stuntin Like My Daddy In Da Bak Seat Of Da Phantom
Drivin My 80 In Tank Top And Da Bandana
Tell Em Take Me Through Da South Off Tha Window Hangin Out
Ohh There Go Stupid Let Me Hang All The Way Out
Tell Em Take Me Through Da South Off Tha Window Hangin Out
Ohh There Go Stupid Let Me Hang All The Way Out

[Chorus x2: Lil Phat]
