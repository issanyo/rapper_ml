[Intro]
Tryna use a rubber tonight
I'm in A-Town, tryna use a rubber tonight
All the way in California, tryna use a rubber tonight
Latex, safe sex, I'm using a rubber tonight

[Verse 1]
Independent with the but that I like
I'm finna hit her up and see if I can cuddle tonight
You need to leave that boy alone if he ain't cutting you right
Another bad bitch song, Savage Life on the mic
We drinking crissy tonight, we getting pissy tonight
We having fun we ain't thinking about no niggas tonight
Big money lifestyle so I like em big thick
I don't like lifestyles cause I got a big dick
Talking Magnum XL biggest one that you can get
Go back to the hotel then go through a whole pack
If you wanna bring your friends gone head they'll fit
I got  king size bed and a king size dick
You ain't tryna get up there and wobble that big ass on his knees nah strap it up
I heard that ho pussy been shooting green slime
Perky titties, bubble booty, tell her she ain't fine
Got these hoes hating on her she ain't even trying
Thsi drank done got me in the zone I ain't even lying
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump n' grind
She backed up, I strapped up left her tapped up, pulled my pants up then on to the next one

[Hook]
I'm in Nap Town, tryna use a rubber tonight
Up in Mississippi, tryna use a rubber tonight
I need a bad bitch
I'm tryna use a rubber tonight
Latex, safe sex, I'm using a rubber tonight
I'm up in Houston, tryna use a rubber tonight
Up in the N.Y., tryna use a rubber tonight
I'm in Chicago, tryna use a rubber tonight
Latex, safe sex, I'm using a rubber tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm in my own city tryna use a rubber tonight
Big money and bad bitches, I'm just loving my life
Naked head, never that, I don't like rolling the dice
I like rolling with my niggas on them 6s to pipe
Louder than a motherfucker, my shit sound like a bike
I make go vroom vroom, when I be at the light
My trunk go boom boom and every time I fuck
I don't use dead rubber cause I know its gone bust
I wanna see it from the back when it be leaking and stuff
Then I wanna grip up on your titties while I'm squeezing your but
Ramming your waist, chose a rubber, playing it safe
Take it out, I feel it coming, let me nut on your face
Money good, I'm tryna use a rubber tonight
Tell your old man, he don't want no trouble tonight
I love kids but I ain't tryna make a baby tonight
But I wanna fall up in some pussy and go crazy tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I told Phat I need a rubber mane, I'm bout to go in
He say "I just gave you a rubber", mane I need one again
He say that was the last one, you gotta use it again
Take it off and wash it off and dive back up in some skin
Then I look back at up my dawg and told him "Mane I don't know
Is that safe? Is you sho?" He say "I done did it before"
I need a rubber, I bust her with money he handcuff her
I done finally caught this ho on the free and I'm finna fuck her
I was in my Kia rental, she got him, he really love her
Waiting on her at the house, so fuck it, I had to truck her
I'm a dog, so you might catch me thugging it with my dawgs
In the mall, spending hundreds with guns tucked in our drawers
We ducked off, in a suite, with two hoes licking my balls
I let em lick one a piece, then send them bitches back home
Or back to the streets, or back to they mama house
Sweet Jones Jr., what these pussy niggas talking bout

[Hook]
