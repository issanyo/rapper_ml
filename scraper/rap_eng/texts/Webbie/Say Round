[Verse 1: Big Head]
Due to the situation politics and codes
Let the hoes move the loads, and watch y'all roads
Man the jokes and shit old and you real important
So no talkin' 'bout the murders money launder extortion
The feds they in the area they watchin' my home
Just waitin' on us to slip and get loose on the phone
Say Webbie I know that fetti got you with a fat belly
But your thinkin' cap gotta stay on and stay ready
The game ain't the same, I'm bobbin' and weavin'
Please explain why this snitch still breathin?
Say Boosie you know better than to fuck with that nigga
He ratted on Craig, Boo, Steel, and Avin Miller
We professionals now, young entrepreneurs
So you know them fuck feds out to do us
Conspiracy a motherfucka my nigga so walk light
And talk right cause one indictment get ya 20 to life

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
Hello hello hello hello
Say Big Head I gotta hitcha right back (One)
They got trackers on my Beamer and my Nextel tapped (My shit tapped!)
We got that syrup and that work man who tellin' that?
Switch that purple up to that orange now they sippin' that
Echos on my phone like a parrot on my fuckin' shoulder
Want somethin it's face to face, try somethin' it's K to K (booya!)
The white Jeep cross the street, that's them fuckin' Feds (That's the feds!)
"How you know?" Cause when I look at him he duck his head!
They want Ivyanna Tarlaysia and Tootie all scared
My family fuck around and lose me it's gon' be welfare
So lil' daddy I'mma hit you up later
They ride with LSU shirts on in a blue Navigator
They know I'm after this paper, so they after my ass
30 G's up in the airport, they call in the task
They say "You love to ride wit no legs" No I love to get head
"You gon' be dead just like Ivy" Fuck you Feds! Bitch!

[Verse 3: Webbie]
Say Savage you got work? Yeah white as your T-Shirt playa
Well I been hittin' ya phone all I'm gettin' is the voicemail
I got another number cat, you undercover rat
Playin' like that have a nigga doin' a hunnid flat
I'm constantly stackin' because I wanna live lavish mane
I'm good with this white because I know life's about havin' things
I got two bad bitches that handle business for Savage mane
They get off the plane and I pick 'em up by the baggage claim
Straight to the boulevard I work it and work it hard
Robbers and murderers I serve 'em straight through the burglar bars
I fuck with them Trill boys don't fuck with nobody else
Cause I know I'mma take my charge and I ain't gon' tell on myself
Ho niggas come to my door for the scope but ain't nothin' happenin'
Cause niggas a rat on ya up in court and don't even care
I'm the lil' nigga that'll make a hundred bricks dissapear
A motherfuckin' gangsta, hol' up
Hello?

[Verse 4: Foxx]
I can't talk now this ain't the time or the place
The block hot like grits, ain't tryna catch a case
My nigga just got ten in a for real way
And them bitches know who I am cause what my grill say
So meet me at the spot and we can run it face to face
You see this Cingular gon' have a nigga upstate
And if I'm upstate how the fuck I'mma make cake
Oh you ain't hung up yet you must be workin' for them snakes
You know every hood got snitches, bumpin' gums like bitches
So they won't have to live behind them fences
Sleepin' on hard bunks, pumpin' iron on them benches
Niggas tryin' to get with ya you gone hook or get ya issue
But keep it brief, them laws never go to sleep
If you want them M&M's meet me on ya momma street
Don't forget to keep your eyes open
That cable ain't hookin' nothin' up but cameras and they scopin'
