We still ridin' on chrome (Cause I'm on, wipe me down)
We still pullin' up (Cause I'm on, wipe me down)

[Verse 1: Foxx]
I pull up at the club VIP
Gas tank on E
But all drinks on me (wipe me down)
Fresh kicks, fresh white tall tee
Fresh NFL hat, fresh bauds with the crease (wipe me down)
Pussy niggas wanna hit me with they heat
Real recognize real
Real niggas gon' speak (wipe me down)
Jiggalatin' I been rolling bout a week
You can tell I got cake by the diamonds in my teeth (wipe me down)
Black shades so you know a nigga rolling
They ain't check me at the door
So ain't no telling what I'm holding (wipe me down)
Bad bitches they gon' bust it wide open
Niggas flashing they lil' bread
But I'm the nigga they approachin' (wipe me down)
Small niggas, tall figures
Y'all niggas, crowd niggas
We gon get mac elevens and dog niggas (wipe me down)
Y'all niggas call niggas but my niggas all killas
Get your issue and whoever fall with ya

B.O.O.S.I.E. B.A.D.A.Z.Z. that's me (wipe me down)
Redbones, caramels, all of 'em stop and stare
All of em try and steal my underwear (wipe me down)
I like to floss like Rick Ross
Got a hit called Set It Off
When I sing it everybody set it off (wipe me down)
Black mink
Damn don't play with me
I bust ya dome 8 whips on chrome
You can gon (wipe me down)
Fresh fade fresh J's on the corner playing spades
I'm an ordinary person but I'm paid (wipe me down)
Foxx flipping Webbie smokin' and we choking on a whole pound of purple
Famous like the Ninja Turtles (wipe me down)
Just left New York City
Hooked up with P. Diddy
Finna blow past 50 you gon' have (wipe me down)

[Verse 3: Webbie]
Hot drop, drop top, top drop
Hoes drop it like it's hot
Yeah nigga, I'm the shit (wipe me down)
You see this ice on my wrist
How it glis' soon as the light hit
You can't lie the ice sick (wipe me down)
Purple got me smelling funky
Red monkey 500 dollars on 'em
You ain't seen these yet (wipe me down)
Beating, you can hear me way around the corner
Paint wet with the 24's on 'em, that's a bet (wipe me down)
Ol ladies, baby mommas, few fiances
Nigga's wife, savage life
Who I'm gonna fuck next (wipe me down)
And I use the Lifestyle or the Magnum
Or the Trojan or go head and use the barrel of the tech (wipe me down)
Man this chain hit me for a couple grand
Oh no, I ain't complaining
Just watch how you wipe my chest (wipe me down)
A bad bitch wanted me to stay lil' longer
I'd'a  put that dick up on her
But I had a flight to catch (wipe me down)
