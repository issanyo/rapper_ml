[Verse]
You should know that I come through in the clutch
Ain't been no choke in him
The struggle, either worry or pray, don't do both of them
They'll question what you got in store then pop up at your openin'
Fingers broke on jumpers for tryin' to climb on the boat again
Still here my haters label me loser, feel like I'm 'posed to win
If I don't get it first time, scrap it, ain't no revocalin'
I always been somewhere in the picture, you wasn't focusin'
Questionin' my spot, you alone or somebody coachin' 'em
Clip your circle from start 'cause the other half is bluffin'
Bet they turn your back on your homie you need to ask for somethin'
Don't need 'navi vision to see the traffic comin'
Negativity is contagious, hope I don't catch it from 'em
Good at many things but mastered nothin'
I told my maker I'ma make it in our last discussion
Was given all that I needed how can I ask for somethin'
Dippin' and divin' out of corruption
I did everything I could plus extra, figured they can't complain
They see you as a friend or the F is for financial gain
Don't matter how sun shinin', always a chance for rain
Figured you would keep a open door then the cancer came
Sticky for sleep, Rosé champs for pain
We're all called by the evils, don't do the dance of shame
Check the masterpiece I'm makin' in my custom apron
Life is too short to be out here fakin'
Grownups held the panic in so we ain't recognize the pressure of the obstacles that come 'cause ain't no settlin' for less
You got to get up off your ass, creative energy's forever
Weather any storm that comes to keep the chemistry together
Used to dream about how I make you remember me forever
Then I made it.. somethin' to play, nothin' to play with
Nigga tell me ''shit don't look and sound the same
How I'ma notice you?
Yeah, everything got a lane but there ain't no quotables
I think its time to switch up a little, production overuse''
Fuck is goin' on, niggas fussin' over views
Envy from the flunkies 'cause its fluctuatin'
Tired of sufferin', poverty keeps you suffocatin'
I'll be damned if I fall it's too many busters waitin'
You don’t want to see me thrive in here too much, you hatin'
To me it's clear I got to find out who the fuck's debatin'
Tryin' to merge these dollars in the hustlers nation
Inspired by figments in my imagination
You slept on me, you played yourself, congratulations
Me and my alter ego the perfect collaboration
Should've gave my family more moments, I just had to waste 'em Life's a bitch and you die, why we paraphrasin'?
Schh.. Listen! niggas be out here rattle snakin'
They chasin' followers followed by aggravation
Signin' the fuck out, standin' ovation
