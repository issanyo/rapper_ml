Big plate, big dinner, bitch I'm a made nigga
Ballin' hobby, trust nobody, me and my gravedigga
(I'ma have it all, I'ma have it all, I'ma have it, I'ma have it all)
Cool nigga, smooth nigga, girl I ain't playin' withchya
Get lost or get the picture
Don't let the gate hit ya
(I'ma have it all, I'ma have it all, I'ma have it, I'ma have it all)

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Shorty psychic
See, we just met and she know how I like it
I piped it, told her I'm the one she should spend the night with
I hyped it, juiced her, Kama, Sutra, my timing's super
King, ruler, won't nobody do ya like I'ma do ya
Screw ya bring him to see ya [?] like the ladies too
Two different sets of hands, oops, look what you made me do
That body made for Blue, low down dog and player
That may be true, Mercedes Coupe, since 1982
G'd up, feet up, talkin' big and smokin' weed up
Right and left hand on the D cup, now lay down and put your knees up
Can you keep up? I raise my level
Pick up my pace, if you break down, I guess I gotta settle
Pick up your face
I ain't gon chase, them bitches chase me
All the way back to the crib, from AC to taste me
They on my shit, I'm 'bout my flip, know how to stock a grip
My life is real, ain't nothin' silver spoon or chocolate chip
'Bout time I hit

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Naw
Ain't no hello, be stiletto back to the fuckin' ghetto
Local nigga, foreign pedal, handle the fuckin' metal
Money's the devil, pussy follows right behind, I'm out my mind
Who want say it's not my time?
I'm 'bout my hustle, 'bout my grind
I'm so high, and I don't even know why I'm still here wasting time with you
You got to go ma, know I'm
Not them other niggas, that fall in love with bitches
See I'm a different kind, I'm out here gettin' mine
I've got a money smell, top down, no fuckin' L
Glock down, I'm smokin' big, trapped inside this fuckin' hell
You want all he got, Gucci, Prada, Chanel
Louis, Chloe and Fendi, bread and a two-door Bentley
My hood polluted, there's shootin', boostin' and prostitution
Ain't no snoozin', that brings losin', just keep the product moving
I wake up with my G, that's how it has to be
If I ain't mack on these bitches, then they be mackin' me
