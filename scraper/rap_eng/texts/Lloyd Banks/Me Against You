[Hook: Lloyd Banks] x2
G-Unit makes the crowd get live
So, put on your A-game
Crush the competition
Let the best man win
Cause if it's me against you
Toe to toe
Blow for blow
I can guarantee you gon' lose
We make the crowd get live
So, put on your A-game
Crush the competition
Let the best man win
Cause if it's me against you
Toe to toe
Blow for blow
I can guarantee you gon' lose

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Watch out I got my shoe strings tied
I'm wicked inside
You should see me when I'm flyin'
From the free throw line
We ain't on the playground
See there's rules to this game
Shake him with the crossover
Then I move through the lane
You lookin' at the clock
Boy I'm lookin' for the rock
Ain't no player who can stop
This killer jump shot
And i still got hops
So go on give me props
If you bring it in here
I bet you can't rock
