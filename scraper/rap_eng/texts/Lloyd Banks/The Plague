[Intro]
You rap to me?
You RAP to ME?
You address me in the form of rap

There ain't a MC that can see him
They take me out, see my ghost in the Colosseum
I bring you through doors while I'm proceedin'
Fog up the Deagan, major weed smoke, screamin'
I've been sent here, the style I'm kickin' next year
Few thousand on my sweat wear, meanwhile I never slept, yeah!
New island, i'm on jet gear
True, violent, you get left there
Or sour dreams, see my respect clear
Tossin' CD's, Frisbee the fresh pair
Million dollar mami, probably have her later
The killers on your hottie body, South Jamaica
Weed, shottys, 2 0 12, party like the mayor
You dummy's gave me a shot, now I'ma player
Play your cards right, you'll eat with the God
It's complicated, thousand features involved
They money hungry and my sneakers a prob'
Pin sprayin', on the beach with your broad
The slutty crew came
Each and every poppin'
And we keepin' them all
Hero in a hoodie, hard to dodge attention
The leader of your lynchin'
Don of the benches
Hard days spendin' every night like it's a party
Chip on my Fendi shoulder, take it out on everybody
Back off vacation and you're hella sloppy
Don't ever spar me, that's Grimm
Take out who led the army
King liftin' up the world, got your queen to spot me
You livin' shady, to see my vision you need Versace
I start my morning off with three Vanillas
They rollin' up for me, not even jealous
Rounds of energy
Son of a leaders merits
Tell them niggas I rule 'em, school 'em, they need the credits
Who knew that I'd be tendin', gem in a Yank' fitted
Got my first check, Usain Bolt to the bank with it
Shorty with me, Banks hit it
Drop split, plank visits
Backward you never go, rebel livin' to great limits
It's A.O.N, dawg, I gotta win
Time to bring this motherfucker down again
I see you up, yeah nigga, F.N.O
Gettin' faded everyday cause you never know
My name will live on I could never die
Southside niggas, got to let us by
Rich anyway, money by any means
Back to doing my thing
Signing the fuck out
Queens!
