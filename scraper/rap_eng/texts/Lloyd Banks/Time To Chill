Yeah see this right here
It's so real I see Everything clear

[Verse 1:Lloyd Banks]
They Probably Cut From The Same Cloth
If He Ain't Soft
You Know The Name The Boss
I'm High As a Cocaine Cost
Soap can't Wash The Pain Off
See Fate Is a Mothafucka, Brotha
You Can't Change Yours
He Won't Show You The Money Get The Chainsaw
And Keep Cuttin Shit Off until He Talk
I am One Of The Bosses Of New York
The Voices Of The People until I Walk
We All Know Life Is Bitch Yet I Thought
That It Will Get A little Better From The Hell I Caught
I Lost A Few Screws Can't You Tell I'm Short
From Shit To Property in LI Bought
Shoot Dice Like A Sport And Stunt Like My Time Ticking
Pour Out My Liquor For a Homicide Victim
If My Nigga Ride I'm Ride Wit Him
Blood, Sweat, & Tears done Fell Out Of
My System
Live Long That's The Message RIght
Well In The Hood Over 21 You Started Your 2nd Life
Lifes More Than Neck Of Ice
A Full Deck Of Price
But It Damn Sure Looks Nice (You Look Good)
I Always Had the Ethic Of a Winner
I Work Til' It Hurts Then I Murk On Spinners
I'll Gobble These Rap Niggas For Dinner
Bring Your Girlfriend Around Me I'm Goin' To Hit Her

[Hook:]
Time To Chill And Question What's Real
Reality Seems A Drift
That's Why I Walk Around Like These
Now It's 2006 More Cribs & More Whips
If you Hate Me Get Off My Dick
Everybody Got To Box That's Fits that's it

[Verse 2:]
Easy Deaths & Hard Times
It's Tough To Explain I Figure I'd Just Rhyme
It's All Fine And Fucked Up At The Same Time
I Feel Like They Dealt me a Card thar Ain't Mine
Man Fuck That Somebody Gotta Shuffle
I'm Thristy Sort Of Like The Slave Off The Buckle
My Attitude Is I Don't Really Care
Baltimore Born But I'm Good Everywhere
My Nigga Had Nothin' But Dreams
But The Block Got Him Before He Turned 13
Somebody Leaned Every Baby's First Scream
I've Called What I Seen You Know What I mean

[Hook]
