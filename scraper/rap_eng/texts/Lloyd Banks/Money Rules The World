[Verse 1:]
I ain't throwin' my pay away - the fuck wrong with you bitch, (bitch!)
Nigga money don't grow on trees - I work hard for this shit
You'll get lined up no day - use my head more then my dick!
Keep my bank roll on my mind, love my click, more then my chick! (whoo!)
Haters all over my shit! - Then I slide more then I slip!
Slip - IN and out then I dip (ugh!) - all I been about was my grip
Treat my dinner like it's my last - hoping the car don't crash! (why?)
Cause I'm high and drunk! - The wine and skunk - gots me off my a-ass. [rewind]

[Interlude: 50 Cent]
Ayo pull that back, man!
Ayo play that again man, youkno'msayin'?

[Kids ovation]

[Verse 1:]
I ain't throwin' my pay away - the fuck wrong with you bitch
Nigga money don't grow on trees - I work hard for this shit
You'll get lined up no day - use my head more then my dick!
Keep my bank roll on my mind, love my click, more then my chick!
Haters all over my shit! - Then I slide more then I slip!
Slip - IN and out then I dip, all I been about was my grip
Treat my dinner like it's my last - hoping the car don't crash
Cause I'm high and drunk! - The wine and skunk - gots me off my a-ass
Ask any motherfuckas you want - They know I'm hot, I control the block
And I hold the Glock! - Know just which words to use to get the hole pop
Lil' niggas want doe or not? - They think I think I'm I'll
I think they think the same. - Fake niggas can't keep it real
Soft niggas ganna wait their turn - a real G gonna skip the line
Push you in the back. - And don't really care how you react cause he grip the .9!
Nigga I'm living fine! - My car and my crib is mine!
Why should she have her piece? - I'm not the marriage kind!
