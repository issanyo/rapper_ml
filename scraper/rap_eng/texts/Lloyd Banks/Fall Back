[Hook 2x: Brandy]
Fall back...
I'm trying to breathe and you're killing me
Fall back...
I understand that you're feeling me
Fall back...
I ain't got a attitude
But I'mma flip if you don't give me room to move

[Verse 1: Fabolous]

I gotta stay on the move
So this cat got more spots than a leopard skin
The safe's in the ceiling where I stash drugs and weapons in
Nigga I'm just steppin' in...
Already got boxes full of money like that movie that Johnny Depp was in
I'd rather pull a gat than run
Cause what goes around comes around faster than a gatlin gun
These broke niggas think goin' to Manhattan's fun
I'm on the Punta Cana shore with a Latin one
That can suck a beach ball through a straw
Act like a chipmunk and put nuts in each one of her jaws
Homie, I'm just trying to teach yall how to score
It's easy for me to pull up each fall in azures
And my dope sends buyers from O.T
They heard I got the same shit that caused Len Bias to O.D
This the young nigga that inspire the O.G.'s
In that H-2 with thin tires and O.Z.'s
And yall got jewels but I doubt it's the same shine
Mine look like the sun and moon's out at the same time
Don't worry about the rumors that a broad dish
When I ride around with the same gun Travolta had in Swordfish
So fall back like you lost your balance
I don't want to toss with talons
But you keep stylin'
And I'mma have to let the 16 squirt
And make your white T look like a Miskene shirt nigga

[Verse 2: Brandy]

What the fuck?
Proper truck
7 jeans, white truck
Range Rover sitting on 2-3's
On the 745 on the 105
Ain't nobody in the ride but me
Can't say anything you want about my business
Better hold your tongue unless you witness
My life first hand
My joy, my pain
Not just my music, and my name

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]

You can bet your bottom dollar
If it's ever a room that I'm tied up in
That Im gonna throw bullets like Boomer Esiason
Give him a wound where his eye has been
And lift him off the ground like a hot air balloon when it's firin'
My game's smooth as Mariah's skin
But I'm popular
So I travel with the goons when I slide up in
I'm blamed for the heat round my way
I made it without a Making of the Band
Or a Freestyle Friday
Why you with him if your troops don't buck
I'm at the corner
Wrapping you in plastic like a Fruit Roll up
I get brain from every female
Like my past's intelligent
They're taking more nuts than the average elephant
They acting like they own slugs and armory
But if we bump heads
They'll be talking faster than Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
There's names you can call me
But "Broke" ain't one
I'm in the game for the O.J. run
My goal ain't done
Go in the house with your old gray gun
We got something big enough to be a court case son
And I've learned to overcome the new faces
I'm starting to heat up
So my dick get more tongue than shoelaces
You can catch me in the hood with a couple G's
And I'm bangin' things
High cause I go through more trees than Orangutans
You're going to make me go put the clip in and pop ya
You're horrible nigga
I'd rather sit through an opera
