[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Y'all know what it is
Another one of those G-Unit classics
Wooo!

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel ugly
'Cause I'm givin' my all to a celebrity
That doesn't even tell me he loves me
And I look like a clown when he's not around
'Cause of him the other girls tease me, but way more than others
I tell them I'm not like the others
But nobody believes me
So I don't think he claims me
I thought I was his baby

[Verse 1]
Ay look lady, you tryin' to drive a nigga crazy
Cause you been gettin' inside a nigga lately
And I ain't tryin' to flip, slip, get on some Ike Turner shit
And bust your muh'fuckin' lip
Be in the paper 'cause I'm popular and after that I'm gon' hate ya
I'll find ways to get ya, like fuckin' your sister
And you'll find out 'cause girls don't know how to whisper
She'll tell the whole town 'bout how the shit went down
Now, check it, if you can respect it, I can respect you
Respect to any nigga who check you
'Cause I ain't never made a promise, honest
You just take my words and flip 'em
Blame it on the herb in my system
Why don't you take your lazy ass in the kitchen
'Cause I been on tour all year and I ain't ate a damn thing different
And I ain't tryin' to hear your bitchin'
I keep tryin' to tell you the truth, but you're scared to listen

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel ugly
'Cause I'm givin' my all to a celebrity
That doesn't even tell me he loves me
And I look like a clown when he's not around
'Cause of him the other girls tease me, but way more than others
I tell them I'm not like the others
But nobody believes me
So I don't think he claims me
I thought I was his baby

[Verse 2]
If Banks had been in ya fiance's pants
I'd have that ass jumpin' up and down like Beyonc√©'s dance
I ain't never practiced romance
So if you ain't special, a candle light dinner from me's no chance
Now when you heard me tell you I love you, huh?
When I promise you shit that I'm gon' do, huh?
I ain't ya ordinary nigga that's gon' lie just to keep ya
'Cause I ain't with the bullshit neither
Listen, put yourself in my position, maybe then you'll see
'Cause you got insecurities 'cause I be on TV
But I'm the same OG, protege in your....
Now that I'm on, everybody acts like they know me
I need a homie, you know, someone that understands
'Cause I ain't tryin' to argue before Summer Jam
I'ma want her then, but it ain't always been this way
Remember back in the day?

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel ugly
'Cause I'm givin' my all to a celebrity
That doesn't even tell me he loves me
And I look like a clown when he's not around
'Cause of him the other girls tease me, but way more than others
I tell them I'm not like the others
But nobody believes me
So I don't think he claims me
I thought I was his baby

[Outro]
