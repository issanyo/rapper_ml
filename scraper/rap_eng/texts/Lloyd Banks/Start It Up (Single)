[Kanye West:]
What you gon do?*
It's GOOD Music and G-Unit
Ugh
Banks
Loso
[Swizz Beatz:]
Ladies and Gentleman
You know they made cause cause cause I'm hood rich
You never ever seen good trick
You want a problem
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Wait a minute
[Lloyd Banks:]
Big blue, cotton city shoe
Cotton candy coupe
Hard knock, orphan Annie loop
Off the stoop
Play with me, see what the screamy do
My canary shoe
High beems pointed right at you, peek-a-boo
Benji paper made me hater-proof
All your thing reduce
Menage a trois, purple haze and goose, got me loose
Kick my way in and now I got the juice, Gucci bubble boots
Thousand kicks couple hundred boots gettin flew
My top down, I'm flashing on em
I'm passing all them, pullover and hit the hazards on em
The [? ], wanna pay them dues, now it's back to ballin
The raps a boring dead man, I dip the casket for em
I'm back performing, I bag em
Break their back, don't call em
Look down on em like Dikembe, Patrick, Mourning
Cash is pourin'
Stunt stormin, go this out
Camera phones capture everything that pictures don't
[Swizz Beatz:]
You know they made cause cause cause I'm hood rich
You ain't never ever seen good trick
You want a problem
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Wait a minute
[repeated]
[Kanye West:]
We keep these G's in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I'm gon be at least an hour late
I'm so fresh I should be arrested
New Tody Chester with my [? ] on your chest bitch
She said "hey 'Ye"
I said "Yes Bitch"
Damn I'm only asking you a question
I met this milf at the allstar getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I'm a rockstar, huh, start it up
Start it up, huh, start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Don't take shots at us that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic'd it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I plutonic'd it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet go honour it
These ain't even real clothes homie I'm pyjama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I ain't paying tonite I'm only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said "it's free", I said WOWZER!

[Chorus]
[Swizz Beatz:]
Ninja, Kawasaki, Ducati, my old Harley
Rock the party
Move ya body
Wassup, wassup
Everybody
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Wait a minute
[Ryan Leslie:]
Let's get it started, get it started, get it started yeah yeh
Ladies and gentleman
[Fabolous:]
Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate
Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate!
Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait
Where's da dinner plates?
BMW, ten to 8, interstate 95, passenger
Baddest bitch in the states, half Spanish half trinidad
Complexion Henny state
Y'all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can't afford to be a minute late
It's time to make a movie let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning round the bezel that's tornado watch
My independant chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for chicken, I guess I place my cock
That soft as tater top, long, try me not
Under the wings, fried rice at the chinese spot
I hear 'em talking but they ain't really living it
Opinions are like assholes so who gives a shit

[Chorus]
