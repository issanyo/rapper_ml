[Intro]
Champagne and caviar
Champagne and caviar

[Verse 1]
You're sick of crying, heart broke, look what you get for trying
Rather have a friend now than be with a nigga lying
Now you feel alive, from the reason that things were dying
Value realized, you reached a new low, bring on the highs
Your last guy only put a ring on your eyes
Deading your checks, spending years in a disguise
Your future's fading, now your purpose is getting blurry
Feelings turn to fury, love shots fly
Hoping to bury any memories you did share
You seen all the signs but you would just sit there
Losing your whole mind by the fifth year
She's gone, out to perform hot shit in public
Uh, ran into Hefner, it feels wrong and she loves it
Difference is I don't know how to lie, your life's been one big alibi
I'm cold as ever, as advertised
You keep it real you cut the bullshit out, big bag of knives
Moving on while the scorn attack the prize

[Chorus]
A lot of shit comes with the finer things
Will you accept the bad intentions and the drama it brings?
(Champagne and caviar)
Can't satisfy you, you want everything
Fuck them other niggas give your all to a king
I had the dummies  on my line too long, now I'm gone
Bet they only come around when you on, same song
(Champagne and caviar)
They can fight over position 'cause I'ma still be missing
There's only dollar signs in my vision

[Verse 2]
Nigga broke you heart again, now it's 'fuck you' to all the men
Mind made up no argument, time ate up you oughta been
Clubbing, drunk and ordering, falling in with the regulars
Long as he's getting presidents, your guard's down now
Telling your friends you're happy, they say that they happy for you
On your new beginning, nothing from outta your past can spoil you
All you got is time, feel like you're running out it though
None of your hours slow, that curse is powerful
Make you psychotic
Guess some people need another half to make 'em whole
'Til separation takes it's toll
Can't let the moment replace the goal
Found but never own it, wearing two faces bold
So every now and then you end up packing, suitcase and roll
Been around a while now, seen 'em get frisbee'd often
You don't hear none of the wisdom I'm kicking, too busy talking
If our path supposed to cross then I'ma see you 'round
Word to the nigga trying to G you now
I'm taking off, of course

[Chorus]
A lot of shit comes with the finer things
Will you accept the bad intentions and the drama it brings?
(Champagne and caviar)
Can't satisfy you, you want everything
Fuck them other niggas give your all to a king
I had the dummies  on my line too long, now I'm gone
Bet they only come around when you on, same song
(Champagne and caviar)
They can fight over position 'cause I'ma still be missing
There's only dollar signs in my vision
