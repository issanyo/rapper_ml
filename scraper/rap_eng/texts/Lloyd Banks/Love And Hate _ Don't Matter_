[Verse 1: {​DJ Whoo Kid}​]
Uh! - Full speed ahead to the pounds
I daily double the dollar that's why I ain't been around. (ugh!)
Round here niggas wake up. Wake up! Cut the cake up! [police sirens]
Frontin'! - And get your face cut end tatted in permenanent make up. {​LET'S GO! }​
If they hit you in your "EN" tat' rather see niggas brake up ("AA-AA-AA-AA- Alchemist!")
No shotgun; I'll run over you with the same truck
Attire marked sweater cause it's The Unit forever
The kush match the chedder; and I'm on italian leather. {​Whooooooooooooooooo Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid!}​
Diamond and bring whoever, my moma done put together
A fucking masterpiece from back streets to foreign weather
Athletes don't ball better - +Top 5+ I said it!
My life's the shit! - All I hear is credit or debit
I inherit! (uh!) - The issues of the niggas I get bread with
Respect it! - Vice or versa - Not the type to be messed with
Check it I just want the check! - Bitch I ain't tryna cuddle
With ya I just want your neck - take what you can get! (hahahaha!) (ugh!)

[Chorus:]
Love or hate, it don't matter!
Matter fact I'm bigger than that - I'm flattered!
I've had it with these niggas. Automatic to these niggas. (uh!)
Alota shit been through here - but we have to be the realest. [shot]
Niggas feel this! - Queens the home of the cop killas (Queens!)
Gorillas - with hair, twin triggers and chinchillas! (uh!)
Backs back to back head crack top billas!
You niggas can't eat till we finished! (finished!) [police sirens]

[Verse 2:]
I don't ride spinners! - I pull up on steels cause confusion (hahh!)
A six will make 'em poke out they eyes - like Houston!
A far model coupen, I been everywhere that you been
Broke everybone of Cuban that heat will make you remove 'em! (whooo!) [shot]
You snoozin'! - I stay fully dressed - steady moving!
Dutches full of Mourn in my new pelle-pelle cruisin'. (ugh!)
He can jump him on a boat down, I don't know what the hell he proven
Pro'ly a coke or dope - or both? - Hard to choose one!
The ghetto targets you young massage and get you sprung
You ain't thinking bout new kicks - you want a new gun. (new gun!)
A reputation and armor chest!
And hope the shit you did don't come back, another Karma death!
Yes! (yes!) I'm smooth enough to charm a saint
I'm what these Frauds will ain't! - Man the shit that be on they arm be fake!
Fake niggas die slow as they should go!
They hate me in the industry, but love me in the hood though! (Sooooo?)

[Chorus:]
Love or hate, it don't matter!
Matter fact I'm bigger than that - I'm flattered!
I've had it with these niggas. Automatic to these niggas. (uh!)
Alota shit been through here - but we have to be the realest. [shot]
Niggas feel this! - Queens the home of the cop killas (Queens!)
Gorillas - with hair, twin triggers and chinchillas! (uh!)
Backs back to back head crack top billas!
You niggas won't eat till we finished! (finished!)

[Outro:]
Nigga we the realest. [scratching]
I think these dumb niggas forgot! [scratching]
Time to remind em

[Verse 3:]
We on it all day now so you don't wana play clown
My goons will spin the 'K round you'll run like a greyhound. (whooo!)
This is dedicated to niggas that stay down
In this cold world were theyll buck through a playground
Real niggas don't stay down, they bounce up!
Smoke ah ounce up do dirt and keep their mouth shut! (Ssssshh!)
We bring the club in fuck the house up
Somebody burnt the couch up now I'm kicking them out. FUCK! [gunshot] [beat stops] {​DAMN!}​
