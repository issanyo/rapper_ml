REST IN PEACE...
PAPA BANK$! GRANDMA BANK$!
DAMN!
Yeah! - Shouts to the ones that's real. - Shots for the ones that ain't
Stabs for the type that tell - dictate the next mans fate. (fate!)
As long as my legs stand straight - I'll be running to catch my cake. (cake!)
Bounty hunted and still get high. (hiigh.) - ride till the day I die (die!)
Sigh when the jake ride by - sprint when the jake car stop
Move too slow and you know where you're going a trip to the gate. - Bye-bye!
You think you got 8-9 lives? (lives?) You think you can walk in my shoes? (shoes?)
You're smoking entirely too much - going against me, you lose! (lose!)
What exactly does that prove? - Your bones ain't platinum, you bruise!
I hold the ratchet and tool. - Pop this bastard then bloom, (bloom!)
I cop it, crash it, get two; I stop and laugh at your crew! (crew!)
Then hop through the top, cause there's no top on top of that - I'm cool! (cool!)
And I ride with the Gat - rob who? I'm a problem in fact? - I'm two! (two!)
I'm so calm on the track, I'm smooth! Go anywhere the f*ck! - I choose! (YEAH!)
I ain't no normal nigga. - Damn, sure never been ordinary. (ordinary!)
Can't say the same for these other niggas - bunch of shit you done saw already (saw already!)
Armoured kit, and the doors heavy. - A nigga gun me, and it won't be there. (there!)
I move like, the room right - swear to god, only real niggas up in here! (YEAH!)
Money's my favourite smell! (uh-huuh!) Kush is my favourite color! (uh-huuh!)
I love her! - And we don't party ways, cause I'm a smuggler. (YEAH!)
Hustler! (YEAH!) - I keep my mind locked in on my guap and
I'm dime poppin' and car shoppin'. - Thin vesting and 9 Glockin'
I can't never see crime stopping! (why?) Too many niggas ain't got nothing! (right!)
Random bodies in sacks dumpin' (ugh!) most niggas wanna get a cocked something. (YEAH!)
That ain't you nigga, stop frontin'! - Cause I ain't never been no fool you got your tool
And I got mine too, that's'll turn you to - a f*cking pool
Life's so "Ooohh! " - Nothing new! F*ck with those that f*ck with you!
I'm comfortable and I'm up to TWO
Million more - niggas hating! I've been waiting and I've been patient
Would have flipped if I weren't caking. (YEAH!)
I'm a long way outta that basement (YEAH!)
In that hallway higher than Satan. (YEAH!)
I ain't fall out on the pavement. (YEAH!) - I'm a call out and replace him (YEAH!)
I'm a ball-out and disgrace him (YEAH!) - in a mall out on vacation. (UHH!)
I'm against whatever's against a G, this bitch industry ain't meant for me
It's full of girls! - And punk niggas! - That right there ain't the way to be!
F*ck the law! - I say it free. (say it free!) - Even when they free my niggas
WE - gonna be against the odds - dressed in expensive cars!
Yeah!
Beef starts!
These is BRAS!
My niggas get out the boards...
You ball after ball!
