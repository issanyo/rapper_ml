[Intro]
Yeah, see me, see me
(Whoo Kid)

[Verse 1: Kidd Kidd]
It all started with this bitch named Tina
Met her at La Marina
Didn't judge a book by the cover but it was easy to read her
See I'm too hood, she too diva, only give it when you eat her
Out to eat when you treat her
Bitch I ain't FEMA
The word on the street, she got that Aquifina
But the pussy wetter than Katrina, she's a keeper
But I don't need her
She ain't an IGer but she scrollin' through my pics
Checkin' every comment from a bitch
Glad she ain't leave one
You find a good one, keep her, that's what I was told
But every thing that glitters just ain't gold
She's a centerfold
Lookin' for a nigga with some bread to get a dinner roll
Just another actor looking for another role

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I need somebody that can relate to bein' from the street
She's gettin' naked on the walk-in I ain't come to speak
I think I found her, probably switch up in another week
I'm tryna hit the club, prolly never get no sleep
She done fell in love, I'm just tryna keep it cool
I hear you talkin' but nobody wanna be the fool
Million dollar nigga, had a dream and seen it through
Old bitches actin' different, everything is new

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
She told you what was gon' be there waitin' on you know she fakin'
She makin' moves, the baddest here, ain't near an overstatement
Can't hold no patience, R.I.P. you lost your girl to pimpin'
The one that used to hold you down, feels like your world is slippin'
She's over prison, wanna fly and see the world my nigga
Lettin' you hit her for the settlement insurance flipper
Free porn, I'm with her
Got an ass so fat look like it's custom
I always got somebody, it's hard to trust 'em
You put all that work in for nothin'
Nothin' beats success
You had players, now meet the best
Bout' three degrees in sex
So what's next? Blue dream and cheques
Don't let her get away, you sync' the steps
Got all the goods, you keep the rest
Plenty cheaters out here if you need a test

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I need somebody that can relate to bein' from the street
She's gettin' naked on the walk and I ain't come to speak
I think I found her, probably switch up in another week
I'm tryna hit the club, prolly never get no sleep
She done fell in love, I'm just tryna keep it cool
I hear you talkin' but nobody wanna be the fool
Million dollar nigga, had a dream and seen it through
Old bitches actin' different, everything is new

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
Yeah, it's about you
Yeah, bags from Barney's with no flaws
She prays like them saints on the church walls
Carry-on luggages, Mark Cross
And Valentino bags on Valentine's
She independent, baby girl got her own grind
She got morals, got a masters, and the whole nine
She playin' hard to get
Real hood but a classy chick
If her phone is face down she on some cheatin' shit
Watch these rap niggas get all up in her guts
European time, Eiffel Tower lightin' up
You on real nigga time so bitch hurry up
This a 216, get your ass in my truck

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I need somebody that can relate to bein' from the street
She's gettin' naked on the walk and I ain't come to speak
I think I found her, probably switch up in another week
I'm tryna hit the club, prolly never get no sleep
She done fell in love, I'm just tryna keep it cool
I hear you talkin' but nobody wanna be the fool
Million dollar nigga, had a dream and seen it through
Old bitches actin' different, everything is new
