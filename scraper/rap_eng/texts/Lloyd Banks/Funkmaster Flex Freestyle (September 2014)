Sometimes I wish 50 and Floyd talk
Sometimes I wish Biggie and Pac talk
I wish Tyson never bit Evander ear

And (?) go to Yale
I wish I could free all my homies out the jail
Wish I could bring all my dead homies back
Wish I had that Lambo truck, Bentley truck all black
Keep wishin cause it ain't come out yet
I wish I had my face on a private jet
