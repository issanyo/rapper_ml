[Hook]
Safe to say i don't know you but now I'ma never know you
Fuck your help, it's just another obstacle I'm stepping over
Every time I turn around it's something, I ain't ever sober
Ain't no coming back, you take it there once you bet it's over

[Verse 1]
You don't got me in your best interest it's screaming out your eyes
Princess cut deuces leaning out the ride
Look at your soundtrack, whole material I supplied
Jeopardize my kids meal, send them all on a doctor ride
We represent the minority, let's monopolize
Morning (Mourning) a million tears drop, dealt with too many chopper rides
Everybody for self, nobody chopping pies
Kuniva niggas lay down in a box of lies
Ignorant and fucked up, why would you want the old banks
That nigga there's a closed case, 20 years of my cold tapes
Bubbly cheers and gold plates.. bought the ugly stares and nose breaks
Room full of snakes, finally no space
Fake nigga with a fake page i'm on a ghost chase
God bless the child who hold his own and keep his folk straight
Grimey in a cold state, that's how it gotta be
Dominating finally, i'ma make you proud of me

[Hook]
Safe to say i don't know you but now I'ma never know you
Fuck your help it's just another obstacle I'm stepping over
Every time I turn around it's something I ain't ever sober
Ain't no coming back and take it there once you bet it's over

[Verse 2]
You all the way gone, incapable of change, why try?
Too busy stuck in the matrix, you die without WiFi
Just mind your business, witness turn a blind eye
Shit, who ain't packing kiss your burner bye bye
Your bridge is burning, not mine
I lost my partner to crime, wish i can go get you
Kick it with you one last time, snap a dope picture
Shit don't make no sense, hoping i crack the code quicker
My face a jewel don't let the platinum and gold trick you
The only role models on our side's the foul kind
They teach you all about crime, lucky if he get out fine
Most of my friends were outlined, or outlaws
Why would we care about yours ?
For bundles of joy, rip up your house floors
The victim line'll vouch for us
We on the strip with rocks and Glocks tours
Run from the force, know what they got for us
We all with it, hope your fitted don't get knocked off
Moment of silence for the wilders, you feel the block pause

[Hook]
Safe to say i don't know you but now I'ma never know you
Fuck your help it's just another obstacle I'm stepping over
Every time I turn around it's something I ain't ever sober
Ain't no coming back and take it there once you bet it's over
