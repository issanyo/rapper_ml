[Intro]
To the evil he shows no mercy, NO!
To the deceitful his blows are swift, YES!
But, to the pure in heart he is love, love brothers and sisters! He is our leader!

[50 Cent]
Money buys dignity nigga!
Poverty’s a crime!
Follow me!
If you gon' follow somebody, follow me…

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Im in the hood, niggas don’t see me, I be so low key
I’m where the dope at!
I make bigger moves for bigger bread, yeah!
Test me I shoot a nigga head, yeah!
Listen niggas don’t come round me
They done heard 'bout me
I’m where the dope at!
I make bigger moves for bigger bread, yeah!
Test me I shoot a nigga head, yeah!

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Shit is different now a nigga rich, I will get a nigga hit
You fuck with me, I get you killed, you think I won’t, I think I will
I blow a mil and get it back, yeah, nigga to beef with me you need a strap, yeah
Matter fact you gon’ need more than that, the shotty pop, the buck'll spray you
Your closest friend'll to you and tell you "get the fuck away"
You talk to me you watch your tone, nigga you cross the line and you’re on your own

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Bullet bounce attire, pistol buyer, frequent fire
No surrender, no retire, Imma ball out till I’m tired (getting stacks nigga!)
You like it buy it, if not then just keep it quiet
Half the niggas you admire probly wired (you're rat nigga!)
Gasoline, fire barbeque at liar, buy a mansion just to chill and while they fly I’m getting higher
Rolly drive, rosay drinker, think of don, think of me, you think of bread, lead, 100K arm

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
I’m a king, emperor, these rap niggas irrelevant
The Audemar is blacker than the president
I catch money in the booth goddammit
Sort of like Clark Kent in the Daily Planet
Drop head, pop lead outta car
These niggas better run like Usuan Bolt
I drop a bag, you get showered by hollow steel
Your mama tied up, tortured with a power drill

[Hook]
