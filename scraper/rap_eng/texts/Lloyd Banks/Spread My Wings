Intro: Look how.. All these niggas wanna come around.. But I ain't coming down.. Cause i'm so high (x2)

Hook: I got a skeleton of steel, not a bone for giving up
Gucci hand on the wheel, not a bolt that gives a fuck
Drinking heavy and smoking 'cause I don't know where i'm going
.44 when i'm rollin' I be damned if I get stuck
Bad luck to my traitors, let them die while I fly
Watch me spread my wings as I get high
Hover over my haters, write my name in the sky
I can't come back down there, i'm too fly

Verse 1:
I leave these hating bitches by the gas can
Batman, Batcave, assaulting battery when i'm in track rage
Black Beamer and i'm in the black, fuck you mean
Me popped up or locked up's a suckers dream
None underground nor mainstream but stuck between
Words back and forth with your bird cause I pluck the team
Heart to the neighborhood, hatred for the government
Cause politics is one big blanket they use to cover shit
My soul ain't for sellin' heaven seeks my wealth
Tell the pigs we said no thanks, we police ourself
If success is the Devil's secret, you can suck my dick and keep it
I change my hoes frequent, don't pillow talk to the precinct
Look, that brother shit is over, keep your rifle swingin' soldier
Niggas burn bridges and die tryin' to swim back over
Pardon my methods i'm old school and your weapons are pro tools, i'm checkin' expose you, broken neck for your whole crew

Hook: I got a skeleton of steel, not a bone for giving up
Gucci hand on the wheel, not a bolt that gives a fuck
Drinking heavy and smoking 'cause I don't know where i'm going
.44 when i'm rollin' I be damned if I get stuck
Bad luck to my traitors, let them die while I fly
Watch me spread my wings as I get high
Hover over my haters, write my name in the sky
I can't come back down there, i'm too fly

Verse 2:
Uh! I kick the flyest shit that's in the rap game
Jack chain, jackpot, pottin' Lamborghini's through the back blocks
Skip the pot holes, give c-notes to shorty snotnose, least I can do, I got those, peace out get off the block though
Caddy truckin', fatty fuckin', all I do is porn
Marry nuttin', 'ready tucked inside my uniform
Switchin' gears, would you put me down if you was on
And I ain't have a lick of talent, your caroly views are wrong
So much weed I roll it, vaporize and use the bong
Bright red bottoms when you spot him, and your shoes are worn
These pussy niggas poppin' shit, ain't even in the race
I been shelved two months well, what a confusing space
Catch me ridin' through my borough at a cruisin' pace
Fingers out the window, chuckin' deuces, groupies givin' chase
Nigga try to draw me, he get erased
Word to Boop, Eldorado and Ace!

Hook: I got a skeleton of steel, not a bone for giving up
Gucci hand on the wheel, not a bolt that gives a fuck
Drinking heavy and smoking cause I don't know where i'm going
.44 when i'm rollin' I be damned if I get stuck
Bad luck to my traitors, let them die while I fly
Watch me spread my wings as I get high
Hover over my haters, write my name in the sky
I can't come back down there, i'm too fly

Verse 3:
I smell like my logo, look like I got a deal
Fresh out of yo' hoe, 'nother vagina line and kill
Hand on the wheel, ain't no time to chill
Dolla dolla bill, still ride up and down the hill, rim inside the wheel
I'm good inside the P's, chain hits it black your eyes
White gold, platinum ride, showin' out magnified
Plenty met the Magnums, I see you on the lavish side
Braggin', money bags so big I gotta drag em' by
Stacks by the hundred, seven just this past July
Try me on the mic' and get beat like the Jackson 5
You don't love me when i'm here don't mourn me when i'm gone
I come back as my ghost and haunt you all day long
Southside 'til I go i'ma show my glow.. illest out the city you ain't already know
Pull everybody out the mall when he go, baller he show, Fendi, Bulberry flow, buried in gold, Uh! (woo!)

Hook: I got a skeleton of steel, not a bone for giving up
Gucci hand on the wheel, not a bolt that gives a fuck
Drinking heavy and smoking 'cause I don't know where i'm going
.44 when i'm rollin' I be damned if I get stuck
Bad luck to my traitors, let them die while I fly
Watch me spread my wings as I get high
Hover over my haters, write my name in the sky
I can't come back down there, i'm too fly
