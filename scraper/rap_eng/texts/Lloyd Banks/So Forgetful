[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Boy wonder, one summer I was stunting
Winter falls when I cake more, bag models and crush ‘em
I ain't never been a cuffa, my lifestyle is custom
Chromy Cartier Carrot glare keep me hustling
My lamborghini sunk in, dimes humpin in tight bikinis come when I’m out here doing something
I know it’s something for me, do you think its you?
Problem is I’m thinking her too, and your crew
A girl smooth, got a body like a spur do
And I wanna cruise, hit gears to make your soul move
I’m so cool, ice grills for my cold jewels
Make my own rules, baby I’ma finna rap in old school
She asked why should she, you think you special?
Hell fucking yeah, now come here, let me bless you
Hit yeah, no air hit you in the pretzel
And I don’t remember how I met you, so forgetful

[Hook: Ryan Leslie]
I deal with a lot of pretty girls
So forgive me if I don’t remember you
Yea, so forgive me girl I’m so forgetful
And there’s too many New York City girls
So forgive me if I don’t remember you
If I don’t remember you

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Wet spots on the mattress as champagne splashes
Designer glasses, a couple backstage passes and they fine ass's
Damn how did y'all get here? How are you getting home? ’Cause a nigga gone
Get dressed quick grab her ass grab my phone
Walking out alone, smelling like chronic bag cologne
Driving home still drunk hope they don’t pull me
Cause I’m riding with the bully and it's loaded fully, feel me?
Game tight girl I ain’t a rookie, hear me?
I love the chips, treat 'em like my family,
And we got a thing for the light, ball out, fall out
Do the same thing tonight, flash backs to ass claps
It’s going down long as she black jack
Weed up just to help me to snap back
The last text I got says "I missed you"
I must of missed something, so forgetful

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ryan Leslie]
Flights in planes, overseas, don't be mad, you know my steez
All at once I'll be gone, if you miss me, play this song
I'll do me, you do you
It was good girl, but we through for now
So I bet you I'll forget you
