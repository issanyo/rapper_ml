[Verse 1]
Angels raisin' up, demons fall when I move the pen
Lend me your ear, ya bleed a tear
Ain't no fouler story to win
Confidence rendered hardly and finally got no more room to sin
How brutal this movie been
Ball till my Judas' do me in
My sound's Peruvian
Big barrels mergin' addin' the Uzi in
Burn down the studio, high off the fumes again
Abuse the pens
Snuck out the noose again
Fuck off the tombs come in
Coupes'll spin
And loads of stupid shit
Sought out a few should win
Royal blooded bread to be crowned throne to live lone
Each poem leveled in stone
Beach bound better for zone
These clowns don't know no better
Rebound, strut up the drum
You ain't ridin'? Get out the car and take your bitch ass home
Sit ain't no mistake
You lift the burden rate as we regurgitate
Evil won't eat off the urban plate
I watch them serve the steak
Stupid niggas off the curb with hate
You have the nerve to break
Shoulda, coulda, woulda, been alive, got the word too late

[Hook]
You won't get nothin' you don't deserve, I had to work for that
King story they depend on me, there ain't no turnin' back
They gone do it all for attention, ain't got no words for that
Caught trippin', slippin' off point, fall in a murder trap
Money on my mind can't keep my mind off that
Ain't no turnin' back

[Verse 2]
Tip your fuckin' brim to the monument
Before I bomb you with
Land my hand grenade
Rocket launchers shit, my responsers flip
I'm prompt to hit your sponsorship
They want my mind to slip
Minus we'll grab some hostages
Rivals cut off the chopperless
Bring me accomplishments
You dummies lost somethin' in my expense
Belong beside the bench
My passport flipped in all continents
You couldn't buy suspense
The streets stay jumpin' ain't no time to flinch
Two times for optimists
Fresh shot of lint and a pot to piss
Fear the apocalypse
Everything's movin', won't stop the shit
Like I forgot my gift
I got 'em all wrapped
Few blocks of this
Layin' on the top convinced
Lower expectations and conversations about these pricks
Money droppin' out the six
Lost in the action
Refused then I make it happen
Back against the wall again, fast forwardin'
More than average then
This hip hop shit done got to
Where you rap to be popular
Feelin's flash in the promter
Gotcha where they want ya

[Hook]
You won't be nothin' you don't deserve, I had to work for that
King story they depend on me, there ain't no turnin' back
They gone do it all for attention, ain't got no words for that
Caught trippin', slippin' off point, fall in a murder trap
Money on my mind can't keep my mind off that
Ain't no turnin' back
