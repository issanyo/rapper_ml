We don’t got no worries nigga
Here you made it off the curb you richer
Fix ya, muthaphuckin face! It’s me again with the swagga
Bar gm get you dagger
Louis Vuitton back for stabbing
Usually armed, Cadillac'n
Cruelty long as I’m banging
Be too much nigga for massa
Painting my pain with desire
Hiding through liquor & laughter
Look miss I’m more then a rapper, come wrap your legs round a King
Married to rage & then rapture
Baby my name got a ring
A shooting star hit the ghetto, bury a G in his jewelry, my biggest groupie for company, my first CD & my hoodie
Don’t like me now, hate me later
Don’t let it turn into love
We shot the vein of the inner city, suburbia drug
Finally flossing, let em know it’s us
Rows of trucks
Og Kush & bows to crush
Most of us
Don’t know shit but the struggle
We hold a grudge
Hoes in lust
Got the flow by the nickel, reload and bust
Blown to dust
Bump into it won’t tickle
A opp step up we'll whip his ass
Postion we lifting with the kicks to last
Let us pick your cask'
Ain’t no slippin pass
Georgie’s on to strip his ass
Ran them bitches stranded from my pimpin' past
Tinted glass
Snitches yellin, no tellin I’m dipped in cash
You go to feel me! Flooded out canary!
Summon the wolves Halloween
Here’s my Hail Mary
Shout to those that hold their own way
Helping to bring the team back
Separate from the stagnant ones, it’ll just have to be that
Raising up my MC stats, thanks to Big L & G-Rap
Polly (politic) with the phenomenal
Eat, sleep & bleed tracks!
Facts!
