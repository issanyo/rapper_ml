It's that Coke nigga...
That raw and uncut cut nigga...
Yeah...
It's a Two G Thing...
Southside in the houseee...
Grimey nigga on deck, more sex, more money, more sket
We on it nigga, what I'm gon' buy next, more lane cars
White diamonds on my neck, take it you want it nigga...
Keep playin' 'round with the team I bet what goes around come and get ya
You won't live to play another nigga
Stupid, my heart don't pump a soft drop
Nigga run up on me wrong a nigga gon' get popped
Yeah, we throwin' money in the air
For niggas that ain't here, more power more fear
Yeah, we fully loaded everywhere
No pressure, no worries, no cares...
Pink champagne and blood spill as I count my next mill
Frauds ballin' out with counterfeits I counter that with real
D-O-Double L-A-R, S Class chrome wheel
Why you liffin' up your heel, fancy tire, smoke peel
Half of what you hear is real the other half just how they feel
How the f*ck a nigga know the street and hardly play the field
They sorry baby I don't need a army just the steel
Teal Lambo peel, sweep your barbie off her tail
I'm shinin' in near a town near you, y'nah how I do
In a Fourteen hundred dollar shoe, powder blue
I am great, how are you
G Unit Guerilla flow straight outta the zoo ain't no way outta the crew
It's darker on the other side and death around the corner
Ain't a single soul exempt, keep my vest on with my sonar
Louie V bajama, burn all kinds of marijuana
Life's a big bitch your honor can I deal with my own karma
Keep playin' 'round with the team I bet what goes around come and get ya
You won't live to play another nigga
Stupid, my heart don't pump a soft drop
Nigga run up on me wrong a nigga gon' get popped
Yeah, we throwin' money in the air
For them niggas that ain't here, more power more fear
Yeah, we fully loaded everywhere
No pressure, no worries, no cares...
Life is what you make it, make your money quiet, I don't diet
I just eat, get head and fall asleep
Different path same street
Pillows and buried niggas, niggas pop kiss then speak, bitches line 'em up sweet
Chickens call me cool, my niggas call me collect
I call it how I see it The Notorious Threat
Nigga I'm lappin', niggas joggin', while you bloggin'
Two million dollar home and you been late on your apartment, your rent I'm sparkin'
Moe' pissin', dirty nigga, call me "Mr. Make The Numbers Match"
Ain't nothin' wrong with my arithma
Tick my shit don't tock them temper tantrums get you trampled
They won't do me in the barbershop, my barber got the blam too
Sticky weed and grand crew, tipsy in the tan coupe
You can't wear that man shoe let's put 'em back on canned food
Nuttin' I can't do, ain't much I haven't seen
Who want his land blew, the f*ck is you nigga
Keep playin' 'round with the team I bet what goes around come and get ya
You won't live to play another nigga
Stupid, my heart don't pump a soft drop
Nigga run up on me wrong a nigga gon' get popped
Yeah, we throwin' money in the air
For them niggas that ain't here, more power more fear
Yeah, we fully loaded everywhere
No pressure, no worries, no cares...
I have dreams about the money
You haters can't do me nothin'...
I got so much money
I'll erase ya'll for frontin'...
I have dreams about the money
Niggas can't do me nothin'...
I got a whole bunch of money...
I'll erase ya'll for frontin'...
