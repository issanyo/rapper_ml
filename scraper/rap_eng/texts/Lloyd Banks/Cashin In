[Bridge]
Nigga ain't nuttin' but the toast for free
I'm back in the mix where I'm supposed to be
And I'mma make you notice me
It's time to bring the cash in
The humble life wasn't chose for me
I got so much more money to see
And I don't need you over me
We pull em and we pass em

[Hook:]
We pull em and we pass em (we pass em)
We pull em and we pass em (we pass em)
We pull em and we pass em (we pass em)
We pull em and we pass em (we pass em)

[Verse 1]
It's complicated, I'm hated
Badly underrated, drunk, faded, frustrated
Grab another payment
Take my life, play it x-rated
Every fucking day with something thick thighs
My favorite heart hard as the pavement
Do not spar with amazement, pop bottles and spray it
I'm top line entertainment, dot com for the flamers
I count this money they drain him, hot blonde in my aim
Can't a woman alive contain him, it's not part of my game
I remain, you think you ill, I'm insane, crack cocaine that won't change hall of fame
When I say fuck it, they in your pocket, you puppet, fucking up is not in the budget
Floors discovered, me on the other hand rugged, gold by the nugget
Shinin but they still see a nigga
I give a fuck though, smoking my weed and drinkin liquor
Where all my luck go, tell my Genie she need to see me
They own me something, fuck em all in graffiti

[Bridge]
Nigga ain't nuttin but the toast for free
I'm back in the mix where I'm supposed to be
And I'mma make you notice me
Its time to bring the cash in
They mumble life wasn't chose for me
I got so much more money to see
And I don't need you over me, we pullin and we passing

[Hook:]
We pull em and we pass em (we pass em)
We pull em and we pass em (we pass em)
We pull em and we pass em (we pass em)
We pull em and we pass em (we pass em)

[Verse 2]
Footrace to the title nigga, I smoke your idol
Try me is suicidal, dirty's how I do my rival
And you can get it too courtesy just for moving spiteful
Clashin is critical emergency let the burner bite you
That boy impeccable, certainly out the winner cirlcle
Show me respect, or it's curtains
Learn that my diners purple
Bentleys, Benzes, formin' a line with no rehearsal
Drugs syringes, never clean up to go commercial
Bury all ya beef today and regret it tomorrow
Throw like a 100 gs away bullet proofin the car
And I'mma make it even way bitch I shoot for the stars
Feel like I'm trapped in a yard, Mr. stupid with bars
Daily and back in charge give the studio scars
Jam packed in the garage. I'm the coolest by far
Hard to pin point what I'm doin to human. I'm strange
Fuck em all I dust through em, just cruisin in lanes

[Bridge]
Nigga ain't nuttin but the toast for free
I'm back in the mix where I'm supposed to be
And I'mma make you notice me
Its time to bring the cash in
They mumble life wasn't chose for me
I got so much more money to see
And I don't need you over me, we pullin and we passing

[Hook:]
We pull em and we pass em(we pass em)
We pull em and we pass em (we pass em)
We pull em and we pass em (we pass em)
We pull em and we pass em (we pass em)
