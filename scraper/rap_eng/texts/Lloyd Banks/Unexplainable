[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Here’s where I go in
Back on the dough route
More money to spend, watch how I show out
Lamborghini doors out, that’d bring the hoes out
Dollar signs brung in, thats what I know bout
Neck, wrist froze out, top fiver no doubt
Talk 'bout what you got now, old money don't count
Back with your cake out and quit runnin your mouth
It's something flammable, my hunger is unexplainable

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Cool people, Knievel in my alter-ego
Zero tolerance, we strapped wherever we go
Wife repo, about a mil and a half keyhole
Bite marks from you slugs on tracks and kilos
Three-notes got my p’s q’s in my jeans
G-g-gee whiz, my ride's like a superhero's
Four-five ceelo, look how good I reload
Right back at you bitch ass niggas abide the G code
Click-clack deep hole, the industry Debo
We built these niggas ground up
Why would they figure we fold?
Figure fours on the competition
I Yoke Em tell me you joking
My flow is like the levees open
Foreign trips, four to five zips, heavy smoking
??? tips, 45 clips, Chevy smoking
He put all he got into this I bet he make it
Ain't gotta give me shit, I'mma take it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Here's how I show out
Even though I rap I'm with niggas that move the blow out
Let him pull the dough out
You can make it rain but I'd rather make it snow out
Run up in your crib with the big .44 out
Here's how I show out
Watch when I show up getting chips off the strip with the piff and the blowup
I'mma kill the block and then leave when it slow up
Get your mind popped off before the sign that you throw up
I just want to lamp and see the weed plants grow up
Niggas get that money, legal or illegally
Bullets put these niggas right where they need to be
Bitches never leaving me, Porsche pull off easily
Back on the dough route, grams and the o's out
Ki and the pound wrapped, nigga where your pound at?
Top five in the booth, top five on the stoop
You can fuck around and I'll pop five in your coupe

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Getting money dances and 25 chances
My camp is crazy as the new Black Panthers
Brush toward the canvas as I stroke my ego
Rap Picasso with my eyes closed ???????
Spark Cohibas while I snicker at the non-believers
I break the heart in hoes, I gave my heart to sneakers
I owe my life to Jesus, put my faith in God
I got a thing for beaches, getting my favorite job
Pain happens, young scarred that's what made us hard
Money, drugs, guns ain't facade shorty play your part
I'm part of the lucky to lead a part
Living luxurious, lady layer that's my art

[Hook]
