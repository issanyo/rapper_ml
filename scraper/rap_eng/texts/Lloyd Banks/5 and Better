I keep somethin' bad, I'm supposed to
Hoppin' out with loafers on
Your chick's 44-inch hips, hold the toaster for 'em
My G ways got a (?)
You spend your days on a sofa, I'm car, jet and boatin' on 'em
I roll plenty deep
You get drunk, let the Henny speak
I get jumped, I'll let the semi leak
I'm very cheap, but I still fly every week
Get high everyday, marijuana heavyweight
Nigga I stunt (inhales)
And I ain't offbeat, I took a hit of the blunt
You know the, bigger the inside, the bigger the trunk
The bigger the problem, the bigger the pump
Get slumped, chump
We don't mix, you a shrimp to a soldier
Like oil and vinegar, or Batman and Joker
The new nine will poke ya
You pop your head out your pop, I pop in and out the bank
My bread out the box
I show up late, 80,000 dollar watch
You a hater, join the club
Shit done line around the block
I need houses by the dock, and a Bentley to flip flop
You know I was a (?) when you met me, bitch stop
I'll expose you, blow everything up
Tick tock, do you niggas like G-Money did to Chris Rock
Show up in the Martin, make ya bitch lip drop
Light the whole fuckin' park up, bottom my Zip Loc
You want zip off, young fly thing tuggin' my zipper
The stars came out tonight, but I'm the Big Dipper
Hundred bill tipper, real nigga, a steel gripper
Heel lifter
I'll lift your spirit outchya body
I'll be probably, shotty, every color (?) Maserati
Or Ducati, Bugatti, step lively you snotty
Arturo Gatti with the punch
Let 'em fly, hear the crunch
Bring 'em all out, they be my lunch
I buy thousand-dollar shoes, wear 'em once
I front, I came a long way from sharin' blunts
I'm smart, but that don't mean look to me for the answers
He can't wipe his own ass, leave him in pampers
These niggas ain't good rappers, they good dancers
This shit I know you can't learn on campus
Answers for bulletholes, chances and strip poles
Chick keep your lips closed, on anywhere the dick goes
I'm a walking compliment, you won't get those
All my niggas schizos, and tuckin' it for shit froze
Now watch how I switch flows
I bag your girl and make her tip-toe, all in and out the whip low
For dick bro
I ain't cuffin' a chick though
I'm here and there, air is clear
Know you're near up in the lair
Money to the ceiling, yeah
Until the day I return
I'm leaving you with another 50, enemies burned
