[Hook:]
I got my eye on the profit, I'mma get it how I got it
Get it how I live and you niggas can't stop it
Ain't a shade for my shine, so the haters can't block it
Better days on my mind, and paper is the topic
We don't care about no hoes dawg, y'all can take 'em wit'cha
See ya when I see ya, I ain't gon' miss ya
'Fore I tip a bitch I know I'mma throw it on the strippers
I already been rich, now I'm gon' get richer

[Verse 1:]
This is that motherfuckin music made for smokin
Bitch keep your mind on that money, don't get caught up in your emotions
I fuck her mouth until she chokin
And she ain't talkin back no more, I got her gone off that potion
She got, know I just point a finger and she pop top
All over the highway in my fly-ass Bentley drop, stop
You gettin outta line now, you don't know me miss
You just gave me head, you better blow me kiss
Uhh, I chuck her deuces with the froze-y wrist
"When you comin back in town?" Miss me with the nosy shit
Mary Jane the only chick that I get cozy with
Knockin 'em down, three at a time, posey shit
They been hatin on my hustle, I'm supposed to trip
45 my muscle as I touch you on a goalie tip
Need to call her, fuck her, let the homies hit
And it's M.O.B. for life, boy you know this shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
She gon' fuck me 'til I'm drained then I'm gone
You thinkin you gon' come up on the Bank, bitch you're wrong
You a punk, this ain't yo' song
Take it from me, them bitches there when you're there, there when you're gone
Uh, I'm gettin to it, not your ordinary rapper deal
The package pop, she gettin slipped the morning-after pill
Then I disappear, she probably snorin as I peel
Fame'll get you while you're layin up and that's what's real
Master when I'm smash her, got that mass appeal
Uh-uh we ain't slippin, niggas trippin so we packin steel
The weather breakin, I'mma push the Cadillac until
Magnum block me from the spill, boy that cat can kill
I give a fuck about a cop or catch an oil slick
I done made it out, I'mma go enjoy this shit
Hundred thousand in a drawer that make the lawyer flip
Few more just for ballin out thinkin 'bout what new toy to get, uhh

[Hook]
