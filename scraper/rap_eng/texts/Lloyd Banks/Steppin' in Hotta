[Beyonc√©:] (Chorus:)
Baby boy you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams
Baby boy not a day goes by
By, by, by, by

[Lloyd Banks:]
G-unit!
Banks

You selling half you soul with the kid and fuck
Walk around with my robe in the crib but
You gotta be able to hold on your lid and tuck
About anything that the both of us did and such, we both grown
When I create enough gossiping on my own time
The OG's thinking they hopping on a gold mine
I need you close to me
Is it a sign of it what this feelings suppose to be
That's constantly approaching me
And honestly we both can see
That ain't all about pussy cause I got bitches that'll fly across the coast for me
Banks is a mack, he's something like a pimp
Got the style, got the smile, got the look, got the limp
Only my wifey getting lobster and shrimp
And I ain't got one so there's another one playing shotgun
I need a chick that I'l take the heat when the cops come
I get ya out later on it won't be long

[Chorus]
