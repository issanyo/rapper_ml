[Verse 1: Lloyd banks]

Terror You'll Need Extra Stomachs
Americas Most Wanted
Blunted, Confronted By None
Hunnid To One
Dont no one care about no repercussion, come With The slum
Word to the mountain tops and fleas im crushin' hoods number 1
Counting me out already but i think i
Can overcome whatever obstacle in front me drink high, im sober some
Im nailing everything around here baby
No road to run, holes in your strategy
You fuckin crazy?, you drunk and numb?
I need my fantasies together
And elbow room like metta
Gotta make the shit go happen
Fuck a miracle, go getta
14k on my lo sweater, uh
Don't be mislead by trolling gangsta, should know better
[Bowls and cases], face vanilla
No vacations, cake forever
[Sucess replace my errors] [Stubborn still won't break ] vendetta
Suckas kneel and face beretta
Miss me with that disobeying
Im crispy bricks of paper
Trippy sticks and vapor, lick the tip
You major, hit me later

[Hook]
Never over never done
This game weighs a ton
Its out there, go get you some
Make sure they all know where you from
We represent the slum
Harsh blocks, go pick you one

[Verse 2: Loyd Banks]
Since my young years i been wreckin shit
Ain't know my own strength, my pencil split
All instrumentals sick, inf-red dot on a temple hit
Cool is my temperament, tour 10
Tempted on [?]
Tends to be tension with the kid
Fuck all the pretending shit
Bendin' these lines together left hand
Pardon my penmanship
Gotta work harder than the next man
Armed with a extra clip
Making my shipments before the jet land
Bombing consecutive, rig the election in my city section
Bring the neglected, I implement anxiety inside her world, numb to society
Poppin' these bottles and bottle girls
You want the life now, hypocrisy copy
My monologue
None of them goofy lines hot
Non-glocked and ya pockets small
You don't understand me now
Mind locked im not shocked at all
Bad news will stun ya family
Pine box you dont knock it off
I burn up all your memories
Time dropped and im not the cross
End up right back at the top at all costs

[Hook]
Never over never done
This game weighs a ton
Its out there, go get you some
Make sure they all know where you from
We represent the slum
Harsh blocks, go pick you one
