[Hook]
Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Weezy F matchin with Bird Baby
VRP's, SB's, matchin shirt, maybe
White T, Neck V, glasses are Versace
Married to the mob, but im a bachelor baby
Love is in the air, I put on a Gas Mask
I rather be there first, than the ass last
I'm a Gorilla, call me Sasquach
And I keep my army with me like M.A.S.H
Light up the purp, pass it like Steve Nash
Bitch your so hot I give yo ass a heat flash
Young Money boy, I'm on 03' cash
Such a CEO, like my homie D-Dash
Gas... we mash like Pac and the outlaws
And we stand-up, and try not to down-fall
Tryin' to reach my goal, like a round-ball
Freddy'll do anything for the crown y'all

I keep on looking for something I can't get

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holding back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dapper Don, Cap' of Queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'mma fucking G?
I'm all automatic when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'mma walking bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it live it always to the limit[x2]
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits you dig it?Â 
Me I'm from the street[x2]
We ain't nothing sweet[x2]
The home of the homies
There's a body every week[x2]
Now I don't hear the sirens
But they probably gonna creep[x2]
Plotting to pull me over
Plant the in my jeep
So I'll be skipping cities 7 states in a week
For the wolves follow rules
Don't get moved by the two's blood'll ooze on your shoes
Wait Control your hate, you ain't ridin' in them sixes
Cause you spendin all your on them bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They think they crazy
But they ain't crazy lets face it
Shit basically they just playin sick
They ain't shit they ain't sayin shit
Spray umh 50
A to K get in the way
I bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin mayhem
You stayin wit me
Don't let me lose you
I'm not tryin to confuse you
When I let lose wit this uzi
And just shoot through you Isuzu
You get the message
Am I gettin through to you
You know what's comin
You motherfuckers don't even know do you
Take some BIG and some PAC
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top
What the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers
Tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit
Like it or not
It's like a fight to the top
Just to see who die for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothin like survivng a shot
Y'all know what time it is
Soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats
Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was 80 seconds
Away from the towers
Them cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
It's Nuclear showers theres nothin spookier
You're now about to witness the power
