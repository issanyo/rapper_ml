[Movie Bites from "Full Metal Jacket (1987)", R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman speaks]
Because I am hard... you will not like me!
But the more you hate me, the more you'll learn!
I am hard, but I am fair!
And my orders are to weed out all non-hackers, who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved Corps
Do you maggots understand that? (SIR, YES SIR!)
Bullshit, I can't hear ya!
