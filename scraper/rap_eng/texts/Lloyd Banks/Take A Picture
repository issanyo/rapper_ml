[Lloyd Banks]
This here is a little more than a mixtape so maybe i'll perform it
Uh, the whip shine like there's baby oil on it
I honk the airhorn at them bitches in the street
Ayy, remember me, the on you called a creep
Now my weed so sweet, I hit it and fall asleep
Wake up, roll up again, I get it and bought it cheap
Now you showin off jewlery and couldn't afford to keep
And he won't show his face so ima hook him on the beat
Ima animal too, I put the hammer a do
Make you feel like you need one so I ran with it too
In blue, now all of a sudden I'm back and my shit buzzin
The broads the kids the bloods and the crips love em
'causein, we got the city on smash
When I'm at the stop like they put titties on the glass
I'm the leader of the class, the heat is in the stash
I don't read up on a pass, I dictate the future
Millenium boy, you just can't get rid of ya boy
I chuck em the deuce and get a new toy
These niggas better start actin right, I ain't rap too tight
I'll leave ya head red and white like a apple bite
Come nigga, I got a fat niggas appetite
Pass thru the traffic light, smash on the coppers light (voooom)
The punchline kid is back nigga, look what my punchlines did for rap
Inspired the new jacks that's why they sound like that
Where they chained down ear to the ground like that
The games in now, shot me cause he's the punk
I'm two niggas in one like shock g and humpty hump
Its on now, you got to pop me to shut me up
Slugs missed ya, we ain't mad at ya, boy he ducked
We can go hole for hole or cut for cut
It won't be the first time yall better toughen up
Radio is all messed up now what the fuck is that
It gave em all of the spins and got nothin back
Save ya self studio time and pump it back
I punch a car, you scream help when you see the sarg
I'll go upside ya head, you'll see a bunch of stars
And yellow moons, I'm ballin with a plus garage
I'm Hugh Heffner all over when it come to broads
Even the ones that don't fit in hump the cars(yeah)

I'm back, I can't wait to see you niggas in the street
I can't wait to see you niggas go to sleep
I can't wait to see you niggas 6 feet... Underground
For fuckin whit me now(blaaam!!)
