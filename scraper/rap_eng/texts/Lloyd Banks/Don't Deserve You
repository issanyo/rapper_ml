I think i love you
But don't let me get in the way (get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl
From doing your thing (doing ya thing)
Cuz i don't deserve you
I don't wanna hurt you
Played with your mind
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way (get in your way)
It ain't even the puss, i got your mind
Its usually a one way thing but babygirl got mine
Perfection is the formula when me and her combine
Like candy to the cornea ya finger lickin' fine
And in time im sure that i can please ya
Squeeze ya, need you like you need me and don't mislead you
Loves free, but treat it wrong and pay the price
Get down on one knee that bitch gon leave with half your life
Man believe me i ain't gon feed you bad advice
Look its easy so don't forget to strap up tight ride
I'd be selfish if i kept you so
I love you enough to let you go
Cause on the other hand i couldn't take it if i put all i got in you
And some one got you naked
You work hard for money
But its harder when you make it
These chicks coming fast
Heres your heart before i break it
I think i love you
Don't let me get in the way (get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl
From doing your thing (doing your thing)
Cuz i don't deserve you
I don't wanna hurt you
Played with your mind
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way
What type of nigga would i be to hold you up
You need someone to hold you down when ? your life fucked up
I gotta shake you out my system
Cuz with the fucking and kissing and all your emotions next to me
Puts me in a tough position
Baby what am i suppose to do ?
I can't control my actions when im close to you
You been away too long girl we overdue
Guess the cake ain't enough you wanna eat it too
See me and you have a magnet in between
That keeps pulling me closer
Im like an addict for your scream _________?___________
The baddest in the coast i got to have you like the green the swag is one ___?___
I gotta sex drive that won't allow me to relax
Bring on the next five look how they grindin' on my lap
Booty, breast, thighs keep your boy relapsin' back
And you deserve way more than that
Ill just fall back
I think i love you
Don't let me get in the way (get in you way)
Don't let me stop you girl
From doing your thing (doing your thing)
Cuz i don't deserve you
I don't wanna hurt you
Played with your mind
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way (get in your way)
