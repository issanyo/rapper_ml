[Chorus]
Now that I'm older
I learn to see shit for what it is dog
You live and you die, then it's over
Good to know ya
I'll tell ya family you went out like a soldier
And follow me, and you'll see
To survive this is how you gotta be
A little bit colder, a little bit colder

[Verse 1]
If you gon' put my name in ya verse, make sure it's with the greats
I do it for the half knots who ain't get the breaks
It's just as bad if you roll around with the snakes
I hock a loogie on ya, right in ya bitch's face
Holla at me if it's 'bout chips
Cause I'm 'bout trips, pea green pipin' in a white 6
Run along get ya ice fixed
'Cause mine's glowin', while ya most (?) stolen
I'm brilliant, every other bar is mind blowin'
And there's bulletproof (?) in every car I roll in
I think with the speed of a Cheetah
Around here ya need ya heater, ya enemies'll see ya, uh
I'll fuck her and duck her, you please and feed her
Til you find out is me and beat her, cause you neither or either
You gon' learn to follow suit
Or get a hollow coupe, you'll only be able to swallow soup

[Chorus]
Now that I'm older
I learn to see shit for what it is dog
You live and you die, then it's over
Good to know ya
I'll tell ya family you went out like a soldier
And follow me, and you'll see
To survive this is how you gotta be
A little bit colder, a little bit colder

[Verse 2]
He had the smile of a sinner, the neighbourhood (?) spinner
Headin' nowhere fast, then he passed
A head on collision, hit like a car crash
Bleedin' on the block, with weed all on his sock, uh
He usually had his heater on cock
And if somethin' popped off he would be there on the spot
And I miss him, weed blowin' in and out my system
Holdin' on my 9, I ain't tryin' to be a victim
Heavy on the jewels, so these fools wanna stick 'em
But my dude got the Uz', make 'em move when he's hittin'
This a man's world, and I don't move for a pigeon
He's pound for pound the best, rule's his division
Cross him, the shit can get ugly
I already made you like me, now I'ma make you love me
I got the mind of a old vet
And I ain't goin back and forth with you niggas cause ya no threat

[Chorus]
Now that I'm older
I learn to see shit for what it is dog
You live and you die, then it's over
Good to know ya
I'll tell ya family you went out like a soldier
And follow me, and you'll see
To survive this is how you gotta be
A little bit colder, a little bit colder

[Verse 3]
Yeah, to hell with a burglar, I won't Diddy 'em
I got a strap with snipe scope
With that you could hit the dot off a Indian
It's funny how they turn they backs on you
It's stings like ya ace boon coon rattin' on you
It's real, it's probably why I still
Abide by the drill, never ran, never will
My eyes are wide, another plan, another mill'
Another sport car with my emblem on the grill, and still
I find all ya barkin' absurd
They don't know you bitch, you can find a bigger heart in a bird
When I catch him, I don't Reebok boot the weirdo
He's either out his mind or some kind of a superhero
These niggas can't see me
Nah, I'm not the typical nigga ya seein' on the TV
Now I'm skiin' in a GT
They love me in the town, they OD off a GP

[Chorus]
Now that I'm older
I learn to see shit for what it is dog
You live and you die, then it's over
Good to know ya
I'll tell ya family you went out like a soldier
And follow me, and you'll see
To survive this is how you gotta be
A little bit colder, a little bit colder
