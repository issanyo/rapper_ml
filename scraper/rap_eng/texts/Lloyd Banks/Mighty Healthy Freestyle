[Intro]
You know who the fuck it is
2018
Two thousand make cream
At Your Request

[Verse: Lloyd Banks & Ghostface Killah]
Masked up on my last case
Figured no face, no karma
Throwin' salt at me
Prefer my shade by Dolce Gabbana
Rider but bet the dough get some kind of rotation out her
Stand for nothin' fall for anything, pride don't replace the dollar
Adversaries gettin' bent out of shape, and I'm a tip-top
Want this shit, got to fight to get on like Love & Hip Hop
Mary Jane'll tie me up, fell in love with the Ziploc
I done seen your true colors, for green niggas'll flip-flop
Hope you take your best shot followed by something tragic after
Sure you seasoned, I spit in your face like a battle rapper
Shit, I only hit the weed slow, came up a rabbit clapper
Prayed on the God glow and he gave it to me, tabernacle
Never really liked y'all there's hate you notes on my next fee
Baguette sleeve
Unloyal, my begging's my pet peeve
Time for me to jet, heavy time on the jet skis
The dopest supplier, you trippin' let the connect leave
Audacity dissin' veterans puttin' up tanking numbers
Ain't no deuce deuce in your boot with them fuckin' ankle huggers
When we hug these mics we get busy
I'm thinkin' "Who is he?"
A stupid motherfucker
Truck is moving, dumping free work all over to feed the customers
Settin' the soundtrack for the realer kind and greatest hustlers
Haters to fuel up the fire, doubters to act astounded
Smoke for the watchers, Gorilla Glue with the wax around it
Dollars to rev up the ops and ammo to back 'em down with
Double bottoms for ass kickins', the black and brown shits
Certifications debatable, take a fall stay quiet
Your fan base ainâ€™t gone save you, you hit the floor stage divin'
Fire trail from me flyin'
You takin' off? Brave pilot
You makin' moves? Stay silent
You cross the crew? Grazed eyelid
Don't box me in to your categories, I'm alien
On records I hear nothin' but fear in 'em
Break a chair in 'em
I see a nigga dye one more color I disappear again
Y'all breedin' bitches, my blade'll get a cesarean
I gave it everything I had, another high speed choice
Thinkin' "what more do you want from me?" in Tyrese voice
All we do is make it stack, the homicide green boys
Unnecessary altercations keep the concrete moist
I haymaker shit, disciplinary jab though
Limit edition lab coat, Louis Supreme collabo'

[Outro]
For every blow, depends on breath control
So it's the first thing you must learn
Fortunately it's easy
You'll soon learn
