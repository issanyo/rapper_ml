Mmm mmm

[Mya: Verse 1]
Yesterday was not a good day
I went to the Doctor to hear the news
He had the nerve to call me crazy, deranged
A victim of child abuse
Said somethin' was wrong with my head
Told me someone was messin' wit my mind
Said you gotta get out the situation girl
It's only a matter of time
And I knew he was right
One day I'm gonna wake up
And find the strength to leave your ass behind
Maybe if your people wasn't stacked
Or of the sex was wack
Or maybe if you was fat
But damn

[Chorus]
Why you gotta look so good
Damn you make it so hard to leave you
Why you gotta look so good
I don't want nobody else to have you
So why you gotta look so good (So good)
Cause I know you ain't' never gon treat me right
Why you gotta look so good
And I can't get no sleep at night
No, no

[Bridge]
Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm you look so good
Mmm mmm
Why you look so good

[Verse 2]
The flyest thing that I ever seen (Ever seen)
Lookin' like the cover to a magazine (To a magazine)
Remember the day that I met you (That I met you)
I knew right away I had to mess witchu you (I had to get wit you)
I had to get with you
All you do is sit and ruin your mouth (Run your mouth)
So sick and tied
I wanna put you out
See I fuss and fight you almost everynight (Night)
I keep packing my shit
But them my ass is tight
One day I'm gonna wake up
And find the strength to leave your ass behind
Boy I wish you wasn't quite so big
And didn't have sexy lips
Boy you know that shoulda shit

[Chorus]
Why you gotta look so good (Why you gotta look so good)
You make it so hard to leave you
Why you gotta look so good (Why you gotta look so good)
Don't want nobody else to have you
So why you gotta look so good (Why you gotta look so good)
I know you ain't' never gon treat me right
Why you gotta look so good
And I can't get no sleep at night
No, no

[Bridge]
Why you gotta look so good
No, why
Why you gotta look so damn good
Why you gotta look so good
Oh, ya makin' me sick
I can never say no to them lucious lips
Why you gotta look so good
You got a million chicks
And I don't know why I put up with ya shit
Why you gotta look so good
Why ya gotta look so good
It's so hard to leave you babe

[Lloyd Banks: Verse 1]
We both know
If you woulda put on some extra pounds
I would left a long time ago
But ya bank account is jumpin'
And ya neck got all kinda of glow
You know that every time you end up cryin I fold
And can't seem to make up a good enough reason to hit the road
Some reason I'm movin' backwards
When I try to stamp out
For every pair of pants I pack
You take a pair of pants out
It's a shame how ya female anatomy
Kepps on grabbin' me
Havin' me spendin' endless
Endless time with Toya and Natalie
I admit
Your body is one of the things that had to be
Havin' fallin' victim
And all of my niggas mad at me
I was taught
In every relationship there's a casualty
So I suggest you stop naggin' me
Cause I will not
Keep sittin' back puttin' up witcha shhh
And I will not, nope
Go back on my word as soon as you strip
And I will not, nope
Contradict myself
Oh look what happend
I forgot
Make sure you come back up in the same spot
(Just can't say goodbye)

[Hook]
Why you gotta look so good
No, no
Why you gotta look so good
I had to get witchu
Why you gotta look so good
Why you gotta look so good
Why you gotta look so good
Why you gotta look so good
