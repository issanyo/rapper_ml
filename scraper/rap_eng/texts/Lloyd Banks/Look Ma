[Intro]
Fuck with me, let me show you where Im comin from
The streets is crazy nigga, you gon need anotha gun

[Chorus]
Look Ma I made it, Im gettin money
Them haters hatin, they dont matter
Man fuck them all, I got to ball
Look how Im lookin, yo baby fresh
Check how I dress, heres two for you
No love for them, Im super cool

[Verse 1]
RIPs, RSVPs, mansions off CDs
GTs, TVs, surrounded by three P's
Paper power pussy
We fall off the map, bet I won't go back
To what they'd rather me be, casualty caught in the trap
I can't do that, I gotta be with it
I want it, see it, go out and get it
Huffin and puffin brings nothin fuck em
They done made my heart a blizzard
Money scent when I walk in
And my bitch just got the torch in
Better pop when hatin, no talkin
Escort him, to his mafuckin coffin
(Uh) That boy did awesome, he be flossin
Bag em and toss em, my wheels a fortune
On that potion, bet they won't come cross em
I horse em, Im ballin, nigga my skin made of Spalding
You [?] em, I bar in, I bust they ass till mornin

[Chorus]
Look Ma I made it, Im gettin money
Them haters hatin, they dont matter
Man fuck them all, I got to ball
Look how Im lookin, yo baby fresh
Check how I dress, heres two for you
No love for them, Im super cool

[Verse 2]
My car go, but I'd rather let them haters see me slow
Blue what up? Not a thing
Chasin dough, I got to go
We both know, you don't really like me so
You ain't got to front no more, nigga I'm so cold
You can go, die, won't nobody miss you so
Everybody knows you be hatin, but I'm cakin
No conversation, betta get up and get you some
Kinda clique you from, you're far too patient
Not mine, no time for wastin
Better fuck up the guap, shit they comin in like new dollars
Don't matter you stuck up or not
Nigga I ain't throwin my pay away, fuck wrong with you trick
But I get the same bitches home
Givin highway dome in my whip
We gon pick some and then switch
That one, this one, then I dip
Ridin big gun on my hip, sleep then wake up back on my shit

[Chorus]
Look Ma I made it, Im gettin money
Them haters hatin, they dont matter
Man fuck them all, I got to ball
Look how Im lookin, yo baby fresh
Check how I dress, heres two for you
No love for them, Im super cool

[Outro]
