[Intro:]
I don't know what the fuck going on
Uh! Halloween Havoc
Two

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, I let the hood take the most of me
Can't wait to make it out though this is destiny
Feel like something's protecting me
Still one of the best to be added onto the recipe
I'm humble, don't scheme, we ain't the ones to blow steam pressure for legacies
The bottom line is, always picture me in the rafters
Dodging the evil traps hoping the grip don't snatch us
Uh! Cities I've come to manage, need my name carved everywhere
Coolest engine on the planet
Makin' it rain underhanded
Here's the darker side
Put here to get larger as my heart divides
Crack the concrete parks cries, spark your rides
Park your eyes, your stories all been lies
Foreign rides, grip on my side
Don't like how they judge it then pour in lies
I am arguably the flow that fathered three
In charge of thee legion that MC hard has caught to be
Legends don't fall asleep
Born with a brick on me, haunted by history
Promised efficiency, my clique should be
Lift up all this heat, burns to the sixth degree

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah! Ain't nothing left to do but win
Back against the wall already make it you'd be cool again
The paper's were the rulers been
Shout out to the hood and all the real niggas tunin' in
Nowadays you won't know who's your friend
Separate me from what used to be, I got nothing to do with it
But got somethin' to prove again
Me against the globe sour blunt roll

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uh! Visions of me hangin', ridiculous imagination
Don't hold your breath, these money steps make me 6-8
When I awake there's record breakin'
Talk is hurt, land slide and then peasant shakin'
Feathers wavin' on my top ten picks
I pull the greatest out the pot
Blend six, system reloaded
Your behaviour says a lot, been flipped just to be noticed
Son delivers like the first time
Shout out the side that raised me winnin' cigars
That compliments stars, butt out the maybes
Panic raising normally, two wrongs would be just fitting
Mangle them majority, new swords with me just chillin'
In the next few years you hearin' classics out ya buildin'
All for the love of dope, liqueur, chronic
And when I hit the stu I fall in love again
Envision me strikin' it, doublin', writing them troublesome
Shot off right out the struggle son, know where I'm coming from
Green motive out the gate
Allstar day hammer at the game like Golden State

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah! Ain't nothing left to do but win
Back against the wall already make it you'd be cool again
The paper's were the rulers been
Shout out to the hood and all the real niggas tunin' in
Nowadays you won't know who's your friend
Separate me from what used to be, I got nothing to do with it
But got somethin' to prove again
Me against the globe sour blunt roll
