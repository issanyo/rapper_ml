Uh! {Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooo}
I had it up to hear for the year - you f*cked up now! {Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid! }
Shit'll tear for ya pair - I pull a truck up round!
And tear up the square - nigga whassup now!
I'm here and you scared - all you niggas weird!
Now how many album brought my CD kill
I'm ghetto! I'm trill! I'm a easy mill. (yeah!)
Years passed! - Niggas tryna be me still. (still...)
Went from watchin' TV to a TV deal. (deal...)
See me
Peel! Tye smoke in yo grill - chill! (chill...)
Rocks raised in a 3d field - I'll! (I'll...) ("DJ UK! ")
Now I play behind the GT wheel - still! (still...)
I grind like I'm runnin' out of time, (time...)
Now they on me and come up by the dime. (dime...)
Slim, thick, fine, Gabbana design! (design...)
Gettin' my whip washed while I'm on the recline. (recline...)
A quarter to walk in, another quarter to rhyme. (rhyme...)
Your time is so shorter than mine, (mine...)
Cause I get mine, whenever it's bread time! (time...)
He's a perpetrator! - I hurt the hater!
Do something real dumb now or hope it's worth it later! (whooo!)
This ain't my worst behavior
This is free and every verse is paper (yeah!) - I guarantee money knot!
This nigga got a real watch full of dummy rocks
Anybody that rock those, is a dummy! (Uuuuh!)
And I'm in a drop rose and it's sunny!
Rims is deep as the pot hole in the roll. (uh!) ("DJ UK!")
Arrogant since snot nose and it shows
I ain't havin' it! (nah!) - I'll getcha holes in ya clothes
The reign ain't over I got 4s to expose
My closet is the mall, that's why I'm f*ckin' ya hoes!
.357 with the Pinocchio-nose
Only as I hop out the rose...
