"19- 1970 Somethin'."

Yeah!
GGG-GGG! {"ROTTEN APPLE"...}
YEAH!
Uh-huh! {JULY!}
Yeah!
Yeahh

1970 Somethin' - my momz and my popz met (yeah!)
Shit was different and I ain' even drop yet. (uh!)
Years past with a birth of a lil' star (yeah!)
A product of the weed and a bar. (whooo!) {Whooooo!}
Predicted a bad seed by far (uh-huh!)
Now the kids run up and see my car. (yeah!)
I can probably make it fly if I try
Blowin' the lye in the sky when I'm high till I die
In the ride with a .9 on my side [gun cocks]
Let my tombstone read. - I try full of pride. (pride!)
I got a whole lotta dough to get (yeah!)
I am a roller shit! (yeah!) - Captain I control the ship. (uh!) {Whooo!}
A nigga flow like mine he stole this shit, (yeah!)
He sold a few records before he noticed it. (yeah!)
Ma, I can do this in my sleep (uh!)
I skip through the beat hand gripped on the heat. (damn!) [gunshot] {SHIT!}
I'm doin' all this for the niggas that passed
Ball out a tree everyday like it last
Cause bullets ain't got no names, jus' targets (yeah!)
They leave brains with stains on carpets. {SHADY! }
The drama gonna go down regardless
These niggas ready for the showdown they Heartless. (uh-huh!)
Uh - I murdered niggas from the intro [gunshot]
From the switch make the Six-Four Endo. {DAMN!} (whoo!)
Now it's 2006! (yeah!)
I got a brand new house in the cliffs
That's why I walk around in my slips
With a bitch! - I only keep her around for her lips

Yeah! {REEF GOTTA! }
"Rotten Apple"

"MO MONEY IN THE BANK... PART 4"!
