We don't need a videotape or a camera to make this ghetto love scene

[Verse 1:]
Was like a dream when I first met
Your face and your stature
The way you carry yourself
It really turned me on
Control myself, had me in the zone
Caught staring in your eyes
Feeling like when doves cry
And that smile on your face that you had for me
To let me know you couldn't wait to get next to me

[Chorus:]
Give you all of this (girl you know)
Nothing is better than (the way I do it)
Girl you know what it is (you know what it is)
The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive
Give you all of this (girl you know)
Nothing is better than (the way I do it)
Girl you know what it is (you know what it is)
The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive

[Verse 2:]
Paper, denim, Cris chillin (check)
Purple label, ice, glistenin
They say diamonds are a girls best friend
I can see it in your eyes that you're down to ride
The way you move your body made me want you more
I can envision me hitting it, that's what I'm getting that
That fire, up in here
Whoo!
Let me hit that, hit that, spit that
Wanna rush that, bust that, crush that
Oh I ain't playing no games wanna tear it out the frame
We can start in the Range

[Chorus:]
Give you all of this (girl you know)
Nothing is better than (the way I do it)
Girl you know what it is (you know what it is)
The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive
Give you all of this (girl you know)
Nothing is better than (the way I do it)
Girl you know what it is (you know what it is)
The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive

[Rap:]
You know the kid keep something in the whip
Green rock dripping off me I'm stuntin in my fit
They give me the same thing you handcuffin them to get
Cause I'm so fly
That's why its nothing to get lick
I'm a pride a good a hood, the pride of south side
This is a Lamborghini that's why your mouths wide
We can lamp in the villa my hands on the strilla
And you're bad enough to turn a jealous man to a killa
My lifestyles Cristal and chinchilla
Mansions, luxury cars and 4 wheelers
I can four weight anything except for my time
She came to give me that ass but I left with her mind
I'm on the hunt for the right one
Starting in the morning and ain't done till the night come
Either you're riding with me or in somebodys way
Cause all I need is a night and you gonna think about it every day

[Chorus:]
Give you all of this (girl you know)
Nothing is better than (the way I do it)
Girl you know what it is (you know what it is)
The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive
Give you all of this (girl you know)
Nothing is better than (the way I do it)
Girl you know what it is (you know what it is)
The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive
