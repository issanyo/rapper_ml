[Intro: Tony Yayo]
Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
New York, money make the world go round
L.A., money make the world go round
Midwest, money make the world go round
Down South, money make the world go round
Southside, money make the world go round

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Some people want nothin out of life
And some people want it all
Some people ain't livin life right
But fast money make God call
I'm prayin to the angels, but worship the devils
Yeah a nigga rich but I'm livin like a rebel
Ridin' with my strap on, foot on the pedal
Them silly beef raps, now they on another level, level
I grew up on a crop side, the New York Southside
Stayin alive was no jive
Standin on the strip you get stuck like Velcro
Jake jump out, you see heads and elbows
Run nigga, run nigga, here they come nigga
Throw that pack nigga, toss that trigger
Kid I'm still in the P's, girl I love the Audi
If yo' ass pregnant girl, leave the party
My stashbox so big, it could move the shotty
God it ain't my fault, if I shoot somebody
I ain't in it to lose, I'm in it to win
Sex, money, murder, take the safety off my sins (yeah!)

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
Money make the world go round, you better get it
Money cause hatred as soon as you get it
Money make whores, money cause wars
Money make the world go round so get yours
Money make the world go round, you better get it
Money cause hatred as soon as you get it
Money make whores, money cause wars
Money make the world go round so get yours

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, money make the world go round and I got her
Buckle down, do anything for the dollar
Enough bills'll make your blood spill
Kill for bread, anyone will from Queens to Gun Hill
I'm one man, but I own more than one steel
Shiny trey-pound, black 9-mil
Mink Gucci leather got me shoe crazy
Quarter mil' vehicle and I'm a oops baby
And if I'm wearin my chain it's .380
Like Fat Joe, nigga you crazy?
Man fuck friends, this T-dot-O-dot-S
Have it how you want, speed knot or pop chess
Police stompin' niggas by the twenty
And shootin' by the fifty, ain't a damn thing funny
Matter fact, man I'ma do anything for the dough
N.Y.'s finest with llamas and Mo'

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
Money make the world go round, you better get it
Money cause hatred as soon as you get it
Money make whores, money cause wars
Money make the world go round so get yours
Money make the world go round, you better get it
Money cause hatred as soon as you get it
Money make whores, money cause wars
Money make the world go round so get yours

[Bridge: Tony Yayo]
A-T-L, money make the world go round
Ca$hville, money make the world go round
N.C., money make the world go round
Bad News, money make the world go round

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
I love that money, I need that money
It gives me shelter, it's there when I'm hungry
It feeds my kids, it fills my fridge
It pays my bills and the mortgage on the crib
It keeps me icy, it make hoes like me
It gives me seats at the Garden next to Spike Lee
It made me rich, it made me change
I seen a lot of places and bought a lot of things
You got me haters, you got me drama
You paid for the lawyers, you paid for the llamas
You make niggas goners, you rule all the corners
When somebody dies, you gotta pay the mourners, mourners

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
Money make the world go round, you better get it
Money cause hatred as soon as you get it
Money make whores, money cause wars
Money make the world go round so get yours
Money make the world go round, you better get it
Money cause hatred as soon as you get it
Money make whores, money cause wars
Money make the world go round so get yours
