[Hook 2x - Young Buck (D-Tay)]
Why?
These Niggas Want Me Dead (Betta' Watch Yo Step)
Puttin' Prices On My Head (Cuz I Cock My Shit, And I Pop My Shit)
But I Ain't Gonna Change (I Don't Play That Shit)
G-Unit Do Ya' Thang

[Verse 1 - Young Buck]
Some say I'm crazy for signin with 50 Cent
Them same niggas wouldn't offer to give me shit
Niggas hate you when you rich, but love when you broke
I never knew I had so many enemies before
My arm's is open to anybody who want beef
I promise ya'll I won't sleep, till ya'll layin 6 Ft
G-Unit that's what it is, that's what it's gon' be
Benzino or the Source can't hold me
I been heavensent to put a End to this nonsence
The handle of this 4-5'll make him unconscious
Most of these rappers, throw bricks, and hide they head
Come to our shows, then hide behind they man, they homie
I understand I'm a target, I'm on top
But understand if you start it, I'm gon' pop
I'm not and artist, buck is a street pharmast
One of the smartest, that gon' get money regardless

[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks]
My eyes low, hydro' leakin' out that Tahoe
I know, G-Unit's them niggas I'm a ride fo'
Nah ho, I ain't stuntin', nothin'  that these niggas say
Fuck the rap, I can get ya' monkey ass hit today
Ain't nobody picked me up when I was pinned down
I'm double-checkin 'for I leave outta my crib now
Holdin' that 40 on me, sunk in the seat
Cause niggas feel comfortable when they get hit drunk with the heat
I'm ridin' round here dirty, cause they gunnin' for my top
I ain't duckin and dodgin, I'm only runnin from the cops
Spendin grand after grand, bought a hundred on my watch
Just got another buddy, and it holds a 100 shots
I never had a role model, cause he was in a box
So I'm up in the club with either a heater or an ox
Everyday there's another nigga bleedin on the block
But we ridin' with them burners on, even when it's hot

[Hook 2x - Young Buck (D-Tay)]

[Verse 3 - Young Buck]
You see these niggas get out the pen, and think it's good
Go get a pack, and come right back, to the same hood
They think these young niggas gonna post up, and let 'em get it
Ain't been home but 6 months, and got his wig splitted
Comitted to the block, guck these niggas, fuck the cops
Fuck these bitches, fuck ya' chain, fuck ya' car, fuck ya' watch
Ride and I die for mine, pop's, and I hide the nine
Swerving over these white lines, wonderin from the one time
Thug and I know I am, bird from a half a gram
Broke, so I sold dope, and I'd do it again
Don't blame that nigga for runnin up in my house, fool
Ain't no food in my daughter mouth, I'm goin out too
Just think about what your doin, cuz buddy, bullets burn
May god bless his ass, that was that nigga's turn
I'm not concerned with your death threats
You come down here with that shit, and get left wet
Muthafucka
