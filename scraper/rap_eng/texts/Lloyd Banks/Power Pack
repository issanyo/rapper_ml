[Hook:]
I'm one wandering free
Just.. living in a dream
Everyday that goes by
It's the same old shit
I'm like a captain on a ship
With no sudden cause
Only run on a power pack
Babbyyyy, yeaahhhh, yeahh...

[Verse 1:]
Uh
Thirty niggas outside, forty-fives 'round
Traffic died down, ain't nobody organized now
Just because we did it doesn't mean you can
Doesn't mean you can't, but there ain't no ink left in my stamp
Fuck the world I can't grow white sand with chronic glance
Smelling like two different perfumes, that bedroom shit
Genie grant me one wish,I wish to see my niggas
My pop and grandma, I got a million hugs to give her
My boy supposed to be in a league where doubles triple
But niggas slipped him a mickie, now he can't dribble
Little niggas don't exist, blame that on hollow tips
Everybody grown, Southside's the daily horrordome
'Fore my nigga passed
He gave me game gone
'Fore his baby came
Maybe he got caught up in the '80's chain
Don't light a candle for me, like they Glock cock
Everything in eye's view, bloody homicide
Ooh

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Yeah
Henny and haze, now I'm dazed
I'm more than ten year phase, fifteen to be exact, back to first page
Money power respect, that's what the verse say
Swagger style, word play, crocodile furs, hey
Fly since the third grade, you playing catch up
Check out my Louie bag, hat, wallet and the vest, what
Big jewelry neck truck
A Cadillac that caught your shorty with her dress up, I had to clap her
After all of that hating, the hood still waiting
Everybody debating, the spots mine for taking
Bullshit, I menage through
They get to share I get blunts rolled, massage too, party like the stars do
Rob who, I'm holding heat like Dre
Night day, in the 760, light grey
Behave the right way, this ain't the spot for play
Don't be stupid, I got arms like Dr. J, hey

[Hook:]
