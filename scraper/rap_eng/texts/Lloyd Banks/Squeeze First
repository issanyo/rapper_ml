Whoooooooooooooooooooooooo!
I'm a - squeeze first ask questions last
That's how most of these so called gangstas passed. {COME ON! }
So I'm a - squeeze first ask questions last
And if I pull it, I'm a pop it so stay out of my way. {DAMN! }
Cause I'm a - squeeze first
Ask questions last... (uh!)
I ain't the richest but I'm richer than y'all!
Shit! - Bank$ is like a young will Chamberlan - all I do is f*ck bitches and ball. (yeah!)
18 niggas'll splatter you for talkin' that shit
You might as well hire a doctor to walk around with. {Whoooooo! }
Nigga your own blood'll soak your clothes
And I ain't worried about you, comin' back cause you can't smell beef with a broken nose. (f*ck!)
From now on - keep your cars and your homes tinted (uh-huh!)
Your peice'll shine if you had some more stones in it. (ha!)
If you ain't dunkin' or dumpin' then go to hell home (uh-huh!)
Cause the only clip on your hip hold your cell phone. (OOOH!)
I know you're focused you've been writin'
But all your beggin' - is chewin'
{GOD-... } off my ear like Tyson. {DAMN! }
I need a bag big enough to get my mens straight
So I'm a need a O dog, and I ain't talkin' like Larenz Tate. (hm-hm!)
A OG told me to market with the block (right!)
He been around since they hit {Whoooooooooooooooooooooooo} Martin with the rock
{Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid! } Don't make me send niggas to your apartment with the Glock
(uh-huh!) They eat all your food up and stomp you in you're socks (uh!)
I got rocks and niggas can't afford to buy it
(uh!)
That's why I got beef bigger than Kelly Price before the diet. {HAHA! } (OOOOH!)
You ain't gonna stain up my sheets so I'm a chose the couch
And if you on your period you got to use your mouth. {Whoooooooo! }
Some remain and some switch when the hoes got us (uh-huh!)
That's why I know more tricks than the globe trotters. (uh-huh!)
We'll rush your studio maskin' our picture

Make you stutter (huh?) - and say your (uh!) verse (uh!) faster than Twista. {WHAT? }
You ain't headin' in here - cause when we in hotels
They got to lock the floor down like the presidents there. (get back!)
You would think givin' top is a problem
But my bitch can suck dick with braces on without poppin' the condom. (uh-huh!) {Whoooooo! }
All the groupies want to show they face
After the shows, they follow the cars longer than the O.J. chase
Squeeze first {GOD-... } ask questions last... {DAMN! }
Gangstas passed! {"MO MONEY... IN THE BANK... "}
Squeeze first ask questions last. {PART 2! }
That's how most of these so called gangstas passed. {LLOYD BANK$! }
"Mo Money In The Bank"! {ROOKIE OF THE YEAR! }
It's 2003!
{WHAT? }
