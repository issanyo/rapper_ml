[Verse 1]
Bar flipping for whoever will listen I been your favorite
Heard my first verse from hot 97 feel like I made it
Give up this shit and just scramble nights that I made it
Gave my better half to music still underappreciated
Overlooked this is somethin' that we created
Nigga will rather run from the culture yet come for the easy payment
Stuck with the clich√© got the belief to change it
Overshadow with the thought of you possibly being famous
Wanted never run from the cops and they brain [?]
Its so easy to forget sunny days the rain raised us
I felt some kind of therapy joinin' the cypher
Had to jot to keep my hands still made me strong as a writer
Flew past the stage as a hobby song of a lifer
Took undivided attention it's cool long as I like her
Somewhere down the line flirtin' turn into love
Out here waitin' for my turn to reap
Tournament for the thugs

[Hook]
We got all this history but you don't fuck with me like you used to do
Can't you tell they using you? It was just all beautiful
I heard you lost your love for the real hate to assume its true
I been front row at the funeral hopin' I catch your contact
Forever and beyond that, far away from the contract
Doubtful I'ma ever get my mind back

[Verse 2]
You no longer need what I'm bringin' that's what you're tellin' me
Turn your back on my wisdom for catchin' melodies
Lemme guess theres a line of rappers ahead of me
Planted my hood flag in the ground where they can never be
Bunch of crabs in the barrel pile on the jealousy
Further I got away found me stepping down from celebrity
You don't deserve hospitality be a casualty
Body strung up for cavalry knot right along with your battery
Too many lacking the knowledge fraudin' for salary
Took this shit in my own hands being all that I had to be
The game is muffled now need a moment of clarity
Your work is a reflection just leave it home, don't embarrass me
Born into hip hop you feel a bar set raise when my shit drops
Most dangerous drug right out the zip lock
Plug me into your system and get a lit block
Had to adapt to what it went through
Pistol on hip cocked

[Hook]
We got all this history but you don't fuck with me like you used to do
Can't you tell they using you? It was just all beautiful
I heard you lost your love for the real hate to assume its true
I been front row at the funeral hopin' I catch your contact
Forever and beyond that, far away from the contract
Don't feel I'ma ever get my mind back
