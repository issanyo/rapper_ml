[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I heard a lot of people trippin', know I owe em a sorry, they catch me slippin'
I hope the lord take over my body
Imma survivor, think i made that obvi'
Your favorite line be, i phase behind me
My malice off call for blazing tommy
Blue days behind me im [?]
Grimey is easy where i grew at
Flew back to get the money
Comfy in and out the country
Monthly making what you saving
Gave a million bars of madness
Phat asses on me shakin'
Break a brick off on these mothafuckas
10 times, shit dont trouble me
You come for me will make the headlines, word to my cadence and my infrared rhymes, infinite lines
Black mobile' darker tints on the sides
Won't sympathize with ya guilty eyes
Make believes and filthy lies
Watch me tilt the odds, front line
[?] killed ya pride, how does it feel to dive, drown in a pool of ya cool fool to be tryin' me, wreck-less menace to the society

[Hook]
I gotta feelin' they gone fall again
I wish the worse on all of them
Niggas wanna feel important
Let the news do a report on them
Cuz' they ain't gone stop that talkin'
Till somebody out there chalking them
24 drama sink that power take the hearts of men

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Southside against all of yall
100 bills on my calling card
Legendary underground, heavy P in my warmup god, ride or die you join the squad, squeeze on the industry
Kill the noise abroad, keys to the city
Breathe in my poison bars
I barely had a good match, match me with machines, im from the backstreet wit' the team, party islands i dream
My heart's in queens, way before teams, reebok and dreams i got my bounce back
Felt like im on springs, T. Parker rings
Uh!
Ready for war again, boot to your organ
Shoot through ya origin
Respect for my peers, new school moved all of them
Cheers, flew coupes through all of them years
Shittin' and party switchin'
Can't get no sleep my palms keep itchin' my anarchy vision
Why start the mission, let ya mark go missing
You out here blind, await ya dark collision
No passes given pay ya park commission
Soon to be outta the league
Cut the incompetent
Hating won't matter you can't stop the shit

[Hook]
I gotta feelin' they gone fall again
I wish the worse on all of them
Niggas wanna feel important
Let the news do a report on them
Cuz' they ain't gone stop that talkin
Till somebody out there chalking them
24 drama take that power sink the hearts of men
