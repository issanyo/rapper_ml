I like presidential cars, presidential bitches
Presidential Rollies, I’m a presidential nigga
My, my, my life different, my life different
My, my, my life different
And everything presidential

[Verse 1: Trav]
You’re fucking with a PM presidential nigga
Ho, never been a… a nigga, no
Bent the bitches nigga flow, probably in that fake or foe
Proud since a younger and I was busting trying to get the dough
Hold up… roll up, get fold up
..let go, it’s close to us
..dead life, any beat that camp right
Doing by the hundreds.. zooming on that turn pipe!
I earn stripes, you earn badges
Nerve on these faggots, South Side bulling like them average
You lock out, we lock in, what’s popping?
New York city keep it rocking

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
I handle my business like the oval office
Yeah, I’m still shitting, I’ll be over flossing
Dropping head rows on my way to Lamas
Presidential rally, big face Obama!
I had a dream, but rock on my time
Bitches on my back, cops on my life
..package, top of the line
I’m on your bitch brain, my car gone to mine
I blew the fuck up, like I stepped on a mine
… your ten millions, never slept with a dime
(You hear that?)
In my life I had some hoes on a mattress
Life’s a movie, so you just know the actors
I’m on a different lifestyle, no..
My niggas moved away to make your…
They call me Capo, el presidente
I’m in a coop with the roof…

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Fuck you on … I ain’t human
The flies dumb before me die, I play the new one
Niggas don’t want you to win, they’re probably loosing
My bitch a dime, till she snagging for my body movements
Send the keys to the county, and money by the rumours
..on their knees see me tutor
Relay on the rooger, play the V on…
Catching body after body, dead models in my future!
I’m the shit, look at my wit
There gonna be only Gs sliding with these niggas twist!
I’m back to flip, godfather where the half is it
I’m clapping cliques.. get my platinum fixed!
..half a million on my bag of tricks
Back to six… lean back I’m rich!
Class dismissed, missed the sixteen stacks..
…by the bone, poke our average this!
