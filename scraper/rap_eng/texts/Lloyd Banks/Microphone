One, One, two
PLK, One, Two
Uh, You know I O.D. on that Microphone
You need a bed and IV for that Microphone
Alien, no ID on that Microphone
Cool as RUN DMC on that Microphone
Corny niggas shouldn’t be on that Microphone
I style, Talk shit, Pee on that Microphone
I’m what they all wanna be on that Microphone
Play, it’s RIP on that Microphone, Killaa
You know my name nigga, it’s time to do what I do

Just cause I ain’t on the microphone with a hyper tone
Don’t mean that I won’t lit your dome with the rifle homz
I’m in all type of zones, your boy shining like my Chevy when the lights is on
Hammer and the pipes is chrome
My life’s a movie and my nights are flown
As far as the punch, I got it Mike Tyson sewn
White ice, I’m grown
Love it or hate it, high rated, appreciated it, like I snuck all the lifers home
They duck me like a poem, I flow a massacre
Bars ricochet and at whoever flowing after, uh
Play if you wanna, I’m smoking hot, neighbor to summer
Mercedes rubber and I stay with a gunner
Say what you wanna, your girl just made a date with the plumber
Bet I’m laying it if I gave her the number, the Boy Wonder
She jump whips, see me leaving in a mean BM
Said she wanna see me so I’m beamin’ her the BBM
You know how the evening end, fucking hard, breathing then
Shorty can’t believe that I’m leaving her cus she’s a 10
Then I breeze, the wind, bumping Bentley, Beamer, Benz
Cop will pull me over cause I’m clean and on gleaming rims
Microphone Killer, you know my name nigga
Murder one, how I do what I do

Uh, You know I O.D. on that Microphone
You need a bed and IV for that Microphone
Alien, no ID on that Microphone
Cool as RUN DMC on that Microphone
Corny niggas shouldn’t be on that Microphone
I style, Talk shit, Pee on that Microphone
I’m what they all wan’ be on that Microphone
Play, it’s RIP on that Microphone, Killaa
