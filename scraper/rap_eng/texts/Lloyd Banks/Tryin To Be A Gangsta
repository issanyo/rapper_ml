Pass that blunt man..

(Chorus X2)
Ya Jumpin outta character, tryin 2 be a gangsta
But u really a bitch ass nigga ain't ya
Keep talkin and Im a let the 40 spray paint ya
Everybody knows your a wanksta..

(Verse 1):
Thats right, put on the foot locker uniform
I'll fuck around and put a lump on yo forehead, you'll look like a unicorn,(WOO)
I never slip whether I got flip flop or sneakers on
Fame'll make a bitch smile, strip, drop and lose her thong
They ain't attracted 2 u
U tryin 2 floss in yo Platinum Fubu
Yo shits weak and ya tracks are do do
I got a lung like a chimney
The old heads dig me
I'll put a hungry head in ya kidney
My uncle smokin dat OOO wee
I tell him 2 chill but he steady trippin
Blinkin his eyes more than Eddy Griffin(YEA)
This nigga steady snitchin
Til we see em, leavin da crime scene wit a whole lot of spaghetti missin
We 2 hot 2 ignore us, the bitches adore us
They chew a nigga up on da tour bus
Go home and kiss u, hug u squeeze u
The whole time u thinkin its 'cause u diesel(YEA)

(Chorus X2)

(Verse 2):
These niggas want me wet like a grimlin
Shakin da timlin
When Im around, bitches start shakin and tremblin
Im like a Puerto Rican, Jamacian, and Indian
Trinidadian, Dominican, or Sinican
U won't believe what Im swimmin in
I smoke my Dro fresh outta da grinder, it look like a cinamon
I can do da job betta
These niggas crushed up in a Coop, likin tighter than a Bob Sleder
U a actor, better yet a actress
Start beef, and do a video pumpin ya black fist(YEA)
Dog Im not like a lot of heads
Trust me, I'll put a switchblade in yo nostrol like Radamez
And at the time a ladies man
Icy watch, Navy band, play me plam
My records should be 80 grand
Ain't a team out that can do it da way we can(YEA)
Chorus X 2
