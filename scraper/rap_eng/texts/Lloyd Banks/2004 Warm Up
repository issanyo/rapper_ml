[Intro]
Ay yo what's up you know who the fuck this is!
It's the kid Banks ya heard me?
The number 1 fuckin Draft Pick in any hood! G-G-G-G-UNIT!

[Verse 1]
Banks bout the bubble like crush grapes
I don't give a fuck weight, but bring me my cut laid in this ducktape
My heart's colder than upstate
So I ain't got time for relationships give me a slut date
I'm far from sweet but can't get enough cake
Nigga I'll put you on your ass like tough breaks
Bitch you could be rich, if you can spend babies
I disrespect niggas, call men ladies
Where I'm from the gun sound like M-80's
Timbs all year: Black, Brown and Gravy
Banks got a gun that'll back down the Navy
So if you owe me: Get smacked down or pay me
I'm honest it ain't no lies
Nigga I don't even need in restaurants if it ain't no fries
I throw combos: 6's, 4's, and 5's
Don't put your hand out, if it ain't for a five
These rap niggas following me like tour guides
Talking gangsta like they got more lives
I pound out pussy leave 'em with sore thighs
Nigga I been fucking with tits with before eyes
You might see me in the shit the store hides
I don't care I punch niggas with four eyes
Every Bar takes away a little more pride
I got something for big small and tall guys
We might pull up in big, small or tall rides
We might pull up and put a bullet in your ride
Niggas want it with Banks, even the whores tried
I put something in your gut through your door slide
Fuck a tux I never fall in Love with them clothes
I'm ghetto, Timbaland bubblegum soles
I done seen girls turning to double dumb hoes
Then they get pregnant, another one grows
Haters must wanna see the brother gun blow
Get at me the kid with the number 1 flow
If there's more than one ho, sit back and blow me
And argue over my balls like Shaq and Kobe
Ya'll know me, relax twist back the dro-y
Yack and moey, fuck around and yap your roley
Ya'll don't want problems, so you give me dap to show me
Nothing but cop lovers running with Axel Foley
Ya'll ain't got no aim, bunch of sloppy sprayers
Hitting up the wall more than hockey players
Niggas, thought I was sweet and jock me later
Get your own shit, why you wanna copy hater?
I'm a big dog, you puppy chow
Hoes wanna fuck me now 'cuz they hear my name like the Puffy trial
That nigga got a bad temper, plus he foul
Blowing dro, hand picked from a pluffy spout

[Outro]
Yeah, here we go!
That wasn't it Green I'm just playing
