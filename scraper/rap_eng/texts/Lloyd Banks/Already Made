[Verse 1]
Fifty two weeks I've been focused on the colour
Without the sight of it I suffer money green mofucker
Gotta separate my presence from the suckers
Can't be cracking under pressure up the effort it gets tougher
Gotta problem my bond is drama forever
I used to turn a blind eye to petty but now its all my pleasure
I gotta big old ego dominates whoever
Holdin on to guarantees I made in life my promise came together
Claim you love a nigga lock, well let me measure
Still gon be ontop of me knowing its hard times under the treasure
Ever second guessed the nigga lets remember
Spent all my broker days schooling, think I fall out that class never
Who gon love you better, who gon fuck you better huh?
She busy trying to be you why will I want be with her
We dun drink so much tonight it be a blur
Celebrating all winter drug dinner in the fur

[Chorus]
Salute to all my niggas in the grave
Nigga keep your favors we dont need them we already made
Never been a minus on my grade
All I see is dollars, hang the fuck up you ain't gettin paid
Line of foreigns pull up in the scene
Millionaires and you rather be famous, what the fuck you mean?
Winnin more help will your self esteem
M.O.B forever, nothing matters but the team

[Verse 2]
Nothin really matters but the money
Give my undivided attention, been consistent so they wanna gun me
Tap my signature around the country
Man killin niggas with this shit for years, guess they need it monthly
Hallelujah we dun made it out the sewer
Where's my seniorities, through all the hard times I maneuver
Keep a party poppin pocket full of mulla
Buck and chizzy [?] on a interstate dropping off your rumors
Millys for the static, winnings automatic dawg
You're fakin' in your forties I ain't for the back and forth
Niggas owe me something stackin' up the cost
Got the discipline of a worker and passion of a boss
Quiet baby lemme break you off the with aura
To be successful you gotta listen, it's gonna take some more though
When the shots go I gotta be the caller
Now it's to hell with the other bitches I got me a supporter

[Chorus]
Salute to all my niggas in the grave
Nigga keep your favors we dont need them we already made
Never been a minus on my grade
All I see is dollars, hang the fuck up you ain't gettin paid
Line of foreigns pull up in the scene
Millionaires and you rather be famous, what the fuck you mean?
Winnin more will help your self esteem
M.O.B forever, nothing matters but the team
