Hook: My blood rushin off 151 proof
High speed blowing weed out the sunroof
My car got navigation if u want too
Later I can come thru, and break it down till I touch that spot
U should hop up on it, baby my performance
Will make u gimme everything u got
I'I'm fresh of the corner
Shorty let me warn ya
I'm a put it on ya till you drop

I'm fresh off the block, what it do baby?
It's a new year and you can be my new lady
I got a reputation for representing
If sex was a weapon, I'm a fully loaded Heckler
Steppin, flossin, jewelry game awesome, frostin
Brighter then the lights on a Porcshe and they hatin'
But I don't pay 'em no mind
Cause what I got could turn a pig to a pork rind
They probably mad cause they rentin and I bought mine
And the truck sittin' higher then new york crime
The fans know what's up, the shortys show me love
They don't need an upper I'm they one and only drug

Babygirl u comin or not
If this was alcohol it'd be 100 a shot
Ever since the parkin' lot
I've been wantin to pop and if you knew my catalog
All the frontin would stop
I got us dyin out the rock, with our own lil spot
She's like a porno star, and shes on that cock
I got a senior out in college and a dome that's hot
She got energy I got night and morn' that twat
Like it or not, I'm not f*ckin with ya'll
I'll be damned to participate in somethin' this small
It's really nothin to ball
I got a couple to call
Three cousins from the bean and I'm f*ckin 'em all
