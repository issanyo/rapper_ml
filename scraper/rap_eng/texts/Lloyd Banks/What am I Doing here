[Intro: x2]
Nigga this where I'm from I ain't going nowhere
Niggas get gone every year don't care

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
There ain't a manual I wouldn't put together
Put your paper on it
Fuck with Hefner you could never
My flow is like the crack and boosting era
Take a couple of your favorites and patch the 2 together
Banks, exotic ranger cruising through Jacuzzi weather
Papa told me never sweat her let the porno movies get her
Quitter, cold niggas bust her ass then I pass
200 on the dash move fast hit the flash
Old soul my flows like a blast from the past
A rare case on ya last bit of cash
Daydreaming out the roof cause it's see through
Rolling up bopping to that h.n.I.c 2
These are medical weed blue
Hot mornings to sea blue a rap fiends needle
Nigga I see you, around about the same street
Pounding out the same freaks
I ain't trying ta make peace
Please

[Hook:]
This where I'm from I ain't going nowhere
Niggas get gone every year don't care
Uh this all I know where the fuck I'm gone go
Real nigga to the ground in death row

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, you unemployed boy hating ain't the average job
Heater in his eyes he be stiffer than the palace Guard
Plush palace with my mind on karats
College kid calculation with my arm on status
Hennessy fifths and chron chron habits, cause my life's lavish
Gucci shopping out in Paris all types of cabbage
Minute I land in NY I switch thoughts
Bitches know how I feel, not what chicks talk
Look a nigga lost his noodles in the spot I stand
Up close and personal pop pop blam
Nothing significant he's not my man
So it's off with the original plan
My ace nigga the swam
I hit the switch drop the lam shazaam
40 grand on my motherfucking hand God damn
And your man ain't your motherfucking man he ran
If he ran he banned x'd off from the plan

[Hook]
