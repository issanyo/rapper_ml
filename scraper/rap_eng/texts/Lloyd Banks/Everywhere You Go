[Intro]
I don't know what you want me to do?
Oh, oh I, I get it
You lookin' for a super nigga, huh?
Haha

[Chorus]
Uh, you're lookin' for somebody with some money
That'll fly you 'round the world
Getcha ev-ery-thing
Another prize you can show off like your pearls
Another mama done raised a material girl (girl)
You're searchin' for somebody people know
So you can get attention everywhere you go (uh huh)
Another baller you can show off to your friends (yeah)
'Cause I'm ridin' in the Benz
That's what you want (you want)

[Verse 1]
Uhh, yeah
I bet you if you let me I can help ya
See my way of thinkin', get ya thinkin', then ya scooped
Couple ticks later you'll be drinkin' in the coupe
Emailin' ya friends just 'cause he wheelin' the Benz
Is it 'cause of the name or the Sprewell in the rims?
You got ulterior motives, I can see that when you grin
I ain't him, matter a fact shorty, I ain't them
They ain't me, they ain't been
None of the places that I've been (woo!)
Look girl, I'm tryin' to win ha, how 'bout you?
You still dreamin' 'bout your dream house, how 'bout two? (two)
If you don't get the big picture you can hop out boo
I'm not just seein' eyeball, not here to see ya blue
And this ain't about no other females, just me and you
Be real, I'm seein' through
Everything you tryin' to do, so
If you the topic, you the one I'm tryin' to do fo'
Stop usin' me against me, find a new dough

[Chorus]
Uh, you're lookin' for somebody with some money
That'll fly you 'round the world
Getcha ev-ery-thing
Another prize you can show off like your pearls
Another mama done raised a material girl (girl)
You're searchin' for somebody people know
So you can get attention everywhere you go (uh huh)
Another baller you can show off to your friends (yeah)
'Cause I'm ridin' in the Benz
That's what you want (you want)

[Verse 2]
Uhh, I'm still gettin' them phone calls all times of day
Celebrity bitches is worse than the ones around the way (ha)
I'd rather come from the A, she's been around the K
Around the drug scene, niggas gimme fake pounds and hugs
Congratulations mami, you done found a thug
Bandana, diamond studs, man shuttin' down the club (wooo!)
I hand her the swisher 'cause she knows how to roll it
Keep her round my dice games
'Cause it's cee-lo when she throw it.. (cee-lo)
Ha, I think I found her, but I ain't gon' jump the gun
Hop the fence, I got a couple reasons in my defense
Look, I done hardly took a chick to the movies
Let alone plane trips and jacuzzis, you speedin' (speedin')
I need a reason to say them 3 words when I'm leavin'
Believin', you're mine to myself
Man, listen, you must thinkin' I'm lyin' for my health
Okay, it's time to put my attention in someone else, yeah

[Chorus]
Uh, you're lookin' for somebody with some money
That'll fly you 'round the world
Getcha ev-ery-thing
Another prize you can show off like your pearls
Another mama done raised a material girl (girl)
You're searchin' for somebody people know
So you can get attention everywhere you go (uh huh)
Another baller you can show off to your friends (yeah)
'Cause I'm ridin' in the Benz
That's what you want (you want)

[Outro]
That's what you want (you want)
Haha, but I can't be your super nigga (be your super nigga)
I can't be here, I can't be there (be there)
At the same time (same time)
Uh (uh)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
