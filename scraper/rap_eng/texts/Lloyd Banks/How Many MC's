Uh! All in your vocals, you've been worrying
A culture vulture premature whole nigga for burrying
Two new Colombians, you get to choose a flurry
When you're money thin your rep is fumbelin', here come my curry spin
Dragon in comparison, hip-hop on my tail
I took the wagon out to Madison, you bragin' 'bout your travelin'
Gangster's rapper hastlin', beg to be around me
Got a little problem askin', then they flip into their mask again
Call my number middle nowhere, won't get a bar
Rookie sneek around me, ain't shit tied word to J.R
You on that fake it till you make shit, can't relate so far
You little niggas get a bitch ass mark, face in cigar
Need that flow of century walk, smoke everybody
How many MC's? More bodies in amounts you never spent before
I ain't trustin' nothin', word to the weed I'm puffin'
I mink'd all up in hard times follow my sleeve or something
Haters louder than my sour stash
[Thorough blocks] redirect your coward ass
Trap you and squeeze your neck, the hourglass
Resolve will make you power last
God bless the child that has the sense to separate the fake
Now watch me shake the state
Watch your route, cop'a stop and shoot, young black out the coup
Hot pursuit, thirty Glock salute, flurry I come through
Tell impossible, I'm stoppin' through
Need my lines all back, homicide on track
Where your violence at? Silence that!
Purple haze, watch me murc the stage, form a circle, pray
Heard you say I ain't deserve my way, go back circle they
Choppers on, leave the vodka alone, cheese ontop your dome
Fuck ya mom, more than couple times be, bleed your phone
Comin' back for all y'all left for shit-list for my ghost nigga
Grimy company jewelerry liftin' you get close
[?] prolly shipment out the coast
Close to X'in' everybody, diamonds flick run out the coup, uh!
