[Hook]
Nigga take a good look at this
Princess cuts on my neck and my wrist
Them other niggas can't do it like this
I love my niggas I don't love no bitch
I get the pussy everywhere I go
And every nigga around me got dough
Give me a box of cigars and hydro
G-UNIT-CLICK-YOU-KNOW!!

[Verse 1]
I'm a show you niggas how to leave an impression my flow is amazin'
Male chauvinist, I belong with the cavemen
See most niggas round' here go in the pavement
That's why I smoke so much I don't know where today went
They fascinated by the way my show on the stage went
Bitch I'm a perfect way to blow an engagement
To stop me you gotta put teams and bounties on me
My money long, I need machines to count it for me
I'm glad, they want us dead
But keep runnin' ya mouth and go home with more slices than a bag a' Wonderbread
I'm America's nightmare: Young, black, and chipped up
Plannin' to put more than one plat-num hit up
Standin around where the bums at and gripped up
Layin in the town where they pump crack and cripped up
See everybody knows you stole that tone
Sold a bunch a' records now you scared to go back home (OOHH!!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You know the kid stay with his Nike's new, the throwback is light blue
Came out around the time, my grandmother graduated high school
Most these rap niggas softer than Ja Rule
And they've been in and out as many walkmans as I do
Take time, to figure out who's walkin' beside you
Cause this sonic can feel like a fork when inside you
You mad, cause ya bitch like us
And all of my records get thumbs up, like I'm ridin' by hitchikers
Stumblin' out the G4, cause that's how tha stars land
Shit I prolly been through more trees than Tarzan
On tha road, tha hoes take a look at tha cars and
It's back tha hotel: titties and bras man
Tha new "STRAP DON"
You might call me ignorant, but if you cow you belong in tha Phat Farm
When tha lights get bigger I act calm
Prolly cause Im a light skinned nigga with black arms (FUCKA!!)
