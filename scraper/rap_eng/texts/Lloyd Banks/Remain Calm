[Verse 1]
High definition, you can see the elevation
Clip'll push your shit up like a TD celebration
Humble beginnings lead to greedy separation
The ghetto will dig a plot for you, graffiti checks your name in
And force dependency, the less complainin'
Way they gangsta rep is changin', all in your mentions bangin'
Coffin' through your territory, emblem hangin'
Invaders get packed out, probably won't remember swingin'
I'm like a foot to the squeezer, takin' a suckers wind
Managed to punch for a decade, without punchin' in
Fourth quarters here, comin' through in the clutch again
Right hook on the busters chin, dizzy legs for bucklin'
I damn near copped the alphabet in buckles
The P-L-K, a-k-a, Malcolm X-tra hustle
Ain't no grease out the struggle
Success will silence the haters, it steam out the muzzles
Squeaky clean out the scuffle

[Hook]
Time will wait for no one, toughest thing is staying calm
Fact is closer you get to it, harder they gon' wish you harm
I'ma make sure all of ya'll remain alarmed
Wasn't shit when you was here, won't bother no one you gone
The hood don't got no targets, be a victim young or grown
And envy comes in disguise, just keep them niggas out your home
Gotta wake the fuck up, can't spend all your time stoned
Don't abandon your chrome, you're better standin' alone

[Verse 2]
Lately I been out it,  cause everything in the box go up
Niggas don't really want the collaboration, I wash 'em up
A darker side's much scarier, get your costume cut
Shit from the past hoverin' still, wish I could buy some luck
Bars pierce through BS, hollow tips through the politics
Headlocks and red dots, pile of kicks for your viral clip
Smack you off your shit, make your spinal slip
Celebrate with champagne, bottles tipped on your bottom chick
Protege's comin' at you with styles you lent them
Thousand verses, wouldn't had to diss a nigga for attention
You belong on a page of horrible mention
Wishin' bad on a rider, middle finger, start up the engine
Bet a Roley they watchin' me, your favorite rapper lost his timin'
Bling'll look good red, blood splatters across your diamonds
Rather underground, livin' in corporate dyin'
Stomp you on my way up, achin' in awkward silence

[Hook]
Time will wait for no one, toughest thing is staying calm
Fact is closer you get to it, harder they gon' wish you harm
I'ma make sure all of ya'll remain alarmed
Wasn't shit when you was here, won't bother no one you gone
The hood don't got no targets, be a victim young or grown
And envy comes in disguise, just keep them niggas out your home
Gotta wake the fuck up, can't spend all your time stoned
Don't abandon your chrome, you're better standin' alone
