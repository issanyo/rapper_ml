[Verse]
Under dog is cool, I’m used to being overlooked
Look at me now I’m filled with style, my blunt is rolled with Kush
Look bitch I’m ballin, ballin’
Chasin’ K’s like Reggie Bush
My haters hatin’ don’t know how inside the Bentley look
Five in the mornin’ recording
You think I slept all day
But I really ain't slept at all
I got bills that’s due, need checks today
Southside don’t play
Play around if you want, be another black body dumped
Duck down when you hear the sound
They got peace out here, but not the kind you want
Nigga R.I.P, march throught the club with no I.D
Make sure they put the pretty bitches round me
Tables of Bub’ and it’s all on me
Hoes show love in the V.I.P
Think about bread when you think about P
What I done did and how I OD
Chick ain't a muthaf-cking thing here free
Touch nothing you see
I ex’ing off the hoes quick as they come
Drinkin' heavy rollin’ up like I got an extra lung
Singin' Bentley, sippin’ harley pardon what I’ve become
Leakin’ bezey, reaper fetti, product of mama slum
These niggas ain't never did shit for me when I was starvin’ son
Just me against them, you remember that?
Thought you’d be glad, but you plottin' on when I’m endin' at
I don’t see no kind of friend in that
Fuck 'em all, go spend a stack
Yapping like a bitch don’t get more friend than that
This that no pretending rap
Y’all know how my engine at
Nine in front two ten’s in back
Running with that stack in his back
One in yo ad
I know I’m watched by an angel
Still feel her hugs and her kisses
On the phone with my grandma
Don’t give a fuck bout these bitches
Dont give a fuck bout they trophies
Or anything that they might owe me
I do this for you (you, you)
The only ones that really know me
Only ones that ain't disown me
I remember everything they said
Said I was dead, deaded all that
Sledgehammer right on your head
Live for the now, soo-woo to gone
Sucka niggas left red
No time for waiting rather get mine instead

[Hook]
I gettin’ money on a dime
Girl it’s my time
Go get that Love shit out your mind
You living blind
Can’t go for that will fall behind
I’m on the grind
Im hittin ‘em two at a time
Why would I decline
See you at the finish line
Line, line, line, line, line, line (x4)
