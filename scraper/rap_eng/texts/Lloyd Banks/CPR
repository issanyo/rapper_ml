[Intro]

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Too sharp to be in a bubble
Floating from all this bubbly
On contrary to what they may show
I know they love me
Love me now, 'fore you loving a memory
I miss my nigga Huey anyway
I'll leave today, if He sent for me
Apologies to those who feel the same when I go
And til that day I'm cocaine with the flow
These hoes came with the glow
I'm off the hook, they say my name on the road
My mind trained to get the doe like the brain on the ho
They gave me the crown and the town
Now I'm fucking on somebody Queen
In my big ass master bedroom, house divide the scream
Porno-star star in this movie, the perfect scene
Don't need ya mama, I just hit the purp and lean

[Hook]
Celebrating how we running through this money
I've worked too hard to win to let a nigga take it from me
Nah....Nah
They say the game dying
Yea?
Well this is CPR

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Still Chasing this dream, Grandma told me never give it up
Casualties and early bodies make a nigga tough
Made it out a pistol fire with my liver bust
Product of my era, pray to God the kids adjust
Depending on the crime, you'll get yourself a bigger cuff
Ready to Die how I get too it, early Big and Puff
I'm puffing like a king, life without a limit, plus
Princess diamonds on me compliment a nigga cuts
Scarred the fuck up but the karma wipe away the flaws
Everybody wanna ball, dont wanna pay the costs
I'm getting mine, concentrate on making yours
Finger on the button and I'm taking off

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd banks]
Foreign engine, hear my battle cry, my shadow fly
Black Prophet, couldn't spot it through the average eye
Stack a dollar, never satisfied
They say I ain't supposed to be shit
I'm like fuck them niggas, rather try
Brought up under a sadder sky
Fuck the peace, grab the pie
Trust them hoes the day that Static died? (unclear to me, sorry)
Now give me 5 on the tattered side
The people out here tattling
Putting you on an automatic ride
Blue suits, the foulest crew in town
It doesnt matter your talent
If you run away from them issues, you're down
I know a lot of niggas used to smile
They used to pain
Took too many losses to be losing now
Uh

[Hook]
