Yeah, im still getting money
Check me out yo

[Verse 1]
This is our City, Flow right out the hospital
VV'd up girl, don't let them guys trick you
Homie, that bracelet full of bogeys
I'm a bill away from mil, taking what these niggas owe me
Give me room, click clack motherfucker boom
Think he on my level must of ate a mushroom
Any superhero, Darth Vader plus Doom
Sweep them niggas four to zero, where’s my motherfuckin' broom
I ain't planting seeds, Unless they grow me marijuana
Run last like im fat, bomb first like Obama
Lacing up my Lous' watch me catch another Comma
I'm fucking her for free why invest in a vagina
I’m a cakin' ass nigga, pockets full of batter
Bitches in my business cause my pockets gettin' fatter
South Jamaica boys speed climbin' up the ladder
Success caught my eye, so now I got to have her

[Hook]
I put it down, They can vouch
Ask around, it’s on the house!
She like my style, what I’m about
I make her smile, I’m in her mouth!
Check me out, check me out
Check me out, check me out
Check me out, check me out
Check me out bitch!
Check me out, check me out
Check me out, check me out
Check me out, check me out
Check

[Verse 2]
I was born to be put on, fly since I was knee high
Stacks in my book bag thick as the book of Eli
I hear them niggas hating again, and I can see why
Im miles away from white tee fly, I might need bout
Four triple doubles cause my clothes go in the crowd
Fill the stadium wit loud put them hoes up in a cloud
Back block foul, and you take them hoes to chow
Shout out to my momma she done made a poster child
So much style I can lend you niggas some
Money longer than the list of shit you've never done
My shawty waist thin but her hips are hella dumb
My buzzin' got the bing, kick like a pellet gun
Car laid wit nilla, compartment full of rubbers
Im cold, ain't love sparkin' under covers no
New money, bills sharp enough to cut ya
Mad wheels gotta find somewhere to park this mother fucker

[Hook]
I put it down, make em' vouch
Pass ‘em around, it’s on the hosue!
She like my style, what I’m about
I make her smile, I’m in her mouth!
Check me out, check me out
Check me out, check me out
Check me out, check me out
Check me out bitch!
Check me out, check me out
Check me out, check me out
Check me out, check me out
