[Intro: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, we back
Southside on top, two G's up, Green Gang fame
This where my peddle drops, everything stops
Pretty glitter ring, watch
Hear me doin my thing, pops
Hah, hate my value like I'm hundred mill
Keep it trill all day
Clear the way, cause I come to kill

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Green
The next thing outta Queens, nothin' you have ever seen
I give a boy a bullet, take a bullet for my team
I ain't gon' be nothin', baby, I'mma be a king
Go how far I wanna go, time to do my thing
Yeah, I'mma do my thing, baby, watch me do my thing
They know I'm worth them M's, I'm still out here with my bling
Dirty than a motherfucker, ridin' with my thing
Cause that's what drama bring

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Gloomy evenings, movie screenings while I pass the block
R-I-P's in my skin, regular at the tattoo spot
You playin' Hard Rock, bet a mill and half you drop
I'm still shittin', the dealership is my bathroom stop
This ain't your average gwap, big drop, a bag you pop
Cause niggas don't congratulate me
They'd rather hate and mad you hot
Just be mad you not
Die fast, stab or shot
Rambo dagger, mag or Glock
Lambo swagger, flashing rocks
Ammo stack a platinum pot, guard it like a leprechaun
Louie V letters on sweaters, gettin' my checkers on
The streets crowned me
I smoke all day, sleep bounty
Heat 'round me, hold my toes
The thought of defeat hounds me

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Green
The next thing outta Queens, nothin' you have ever seen
I give a boy a bullet, take a bullet for my team
I ain't gon' be nothin', baby, I'mma be a king
Go how far I wanna go, time to do my thing
Yeah, I'mma do my thing, baby, watch me do my thing
They know I'm worth them M's, I'm still out here with my bling
Dirtier than a motherfucker, ridin' with my thing
Cause that's what drama bring

[Lloyd Banks]
Look at me now, look at me smile
Know you'd rather look at me down, well look at me ball
Bet these girls ain't looking at ya'll
Look at my broad, look at my car
Look at my crib, then look at my yard
Now look at my ring but watch your eyes
Look at my chain, you lookin' for God
Fuck these groupies, I work too hard
Bustin' my ass to stay, shits hard
Give up my last to feed the fam
Keepin' these bastards on they job
My brother's keeper, my passion for the dough is deeper
Chill all year, kill 'em fourth quarter with my buzzer beater (swish)
Look what my pen draw
Bitch with the wrist I'm Chris Paul
Millions by the four, piss poor; I'm on my sixth tour
Me and marijuana equals [??] horror
Catch me on the block tomorrow
Cop a car then pop my collar

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Green
The next thing outta Queens, nothin' you have ever seen
I give a boy a bullet, take a bullet for my team
I ain't gon' be nothin', baby, I'mma be a king
Go how far I wanna go, time to do my thing
Yeah, I'mma do my thing, baby, watch me do my thing
They know I'm worth them M's, I'm still out here with my bling
Dirty than a motherfucker, ridin' with my thing
Cause that's what drama bring
