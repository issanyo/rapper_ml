Glory, nobody got nothin' on me
End of story i'm out here till they call me
Got a bedroom full of shortys
And everyone of them with the glamour
Give me the gold
Fuck about a camera
Cannot be here hating
You want me dead
I hate to keep you waitin'
The heat I'm spreadin' got the street debatin'
The way we at we'll make them patient
All for the love of money makin'

[Hook]
You make a move I'll be makin' two
Kept on knocking now i'm breakin' through
Seen the snake in you
Hunnid blocks away if I should stray
Put my number away
Pray to God I live another day
Might not go that far
Maybe give or take I guess you gotta wait
Till then I'm getting at it
Shit, I feel If I can think it I should have it
You mad? I guess you gotta wait
Don't nothin' matter but dollar weight

[Verse 1]
Music been loosenin' all my screws
More so lock and loose
Hunger questioning got me confused
'Specially when dudes specialize in abuse
Told myself ill never relapse now I'm jeopardizing that truce
Been done grew up out of that box
Worldwide recognized for that booth
At least we made it huh? Fuck that I don't feel appreciated
Easy living don't exist internal shit increase these payments
This street nightclub in [?] get down on all three stages
Fuck these blogs and gossip pages
Take them back who wan' be famous?
Violate, try that here i'lll get you clipped
With evil dollars make your new name sleepy hollow
Nigga 3D TV Horror
Murdered artist keep me calmer
Father please let us get in
Isolate me from these suckers
Money leeches we call friends
Kiss the ass of my Benz
I done been to hell before ain't going back there again
Got an army gone from war another half in the pen
Ain't got no comma for no hoe
Ain't ever had to pretend
For living lavish we sin

[Hook]
You make a move I'll be makin' two
Kept on knocking now i'm breakin' through
Seen the snake in you
Hunnid blocks away if I should stray
Put my number away
Pray to God I live another day
Might not go that far
Maybe give or take I guess you gotta wait
Till then I'm getting at it
Shit, I feel If I can think it I should have it
You mad? I guess you gotta wait
Don't nothin' matter but dollar weight

[Verse 2]
You niggas make me sick to my stomach
I hope my payback bring sorrow
Live every night like my last can't get the day back tomorrow
Y'all satisfied with that thrash
Since i came out i ain't borrow
Flame out the back of the foreign
Sparring with 'zine out the styro'
It's only right I roam freely
New guys gotta play their position
Too hot to ever go freezy
Cruel times bring fatal collision
You guys got some kind of ego stupid audacity nigga
Repeat mistakes till your people slid down the casualty river
Shit ain't got no better either
Kids on my blocks pack a cannon
Stand on the corner [?]
Like dollar sign jackal lanterns
I need whats mine out the gutter
We ain't got no backup plan in the Southside
Motherfucker fuck what you heard no comparin' to me
PLK-ing illest shit out NYC
Fall when I get bored I ball till this shit up on her arm
You hoes gon' sleep till its too late wait calmly for the storm
25/8 always got my armor on

[Hook]
You make a move I'll be makin' two
Kept on knocking now i'm breakin' through
Seen the snake in you
Hunnid blocks away if I should stray
Put my number away
Pray to God I live another day
Might not go that far
Maybe give or take I guess you gotta wait
Till then I'm getting at it
Shit, I feel If I can think it I should have it
You mad? I guess you gotta wait
Don't nothin' matter but dollar weight
