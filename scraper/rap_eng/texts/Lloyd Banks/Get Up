50CENT!
Man I'm up in here do my thang, (GET UP!)
It's crazy in the club when I'm in there mayne. (GET UP!)
Trust me homie I'm not playin' (GET UP!) {"HALLOWEEN HAVOC"! }
Now get on the dance floor off the chain. - I say: "GET UP! " {COME ON! }
I came to bring me that "California Love"
And a lil' New York hatin', it's all of the above
I'm not playin', I'm sayin I'm off the chain {Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooo}
You niggas better follow the instructions. - I said: "GET UP! " {Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid! }
I ball till I fall - I stunt till I drop
I'm off the show room floor, not the used car lot
You buy a bottle! - I buy the bar!
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras
When I get in to it, I get iiiin to it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it. {LET'S GO! }
I make it rain (raaiin!), till the sun come out
A nigga playin' (playyiin'), we make the "Gunz Come Out" {DAMN! }
Noow - my question is who they gonna blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again?
Shit, shift now the game done change
Since Mike made "Thriller" and Prince made "Purple Rain"
I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And N.W.A made the WestCoast bang
Nah, it's just music! - Man, it's just music!
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it! {COME ON! }
I have the South warfare
I'm the reason everybody here
I say: "GET UP! "
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' {CAN'T FORGET... } I really don't care
I said: "GET UP! " {LIGHT THE BARBER! }
I want to see yo, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said: "GET UP! "
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands up in the air
I said: "GET UP! "
{COME ON! }
Girl, you look good, I want to know you better
You look good in them jeans and them red Steletos
You got a Bentley, Coop booty baby I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is when I'm inside
I'm a take you for a spin you know round and round {HAHA! }
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return if you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn I got money to burn
While the Gap Band play she dropped the bomb on me
It's up and down and up and down gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house {GOD-... }
Or 50 you should go home to see what that bitch 'bout! {DAMN! }
I found out she like it how I like it, huh?
Back it up, getcha some
I know how to get you sprung tune you up, use your tounge!
Under the hood, it's so good
She said: "It's so good! " Goddamn, "I'm So Hood"! - Nigga whattup?
I have the South warfare {CAN'T FORGET... }
I'm the reason everybody here, {SHAUN! }
I say: "GET UP! "
I make it hot, I make it hot in here {SHADYVILLE! }
Your feet hurtin' I really don't care
I said: "GET UP! "
I want to see yo, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said: "GET UP! "
I'm getting money man I really don't care {5 AND BETTER! }
Let me see you put your hands up in the air {VOLUME 2}
I said: "GET UP! "
