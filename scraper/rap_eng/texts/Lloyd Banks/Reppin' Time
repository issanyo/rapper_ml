[Intro: Lloyd Banks]
New York City
It's me
G-G-G-G-G G-unit

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Eh, You better watch your moves
Cause I am not your crew
I'm hoppin' through
Impossible to do what I can do
I found my meal ticket
Made it but I still kick it
Faded but I still notice the hate and learn to deal with it (fuck)
I'm on a level not everybody can get to
They've sent you, a pitbull
My beam red, my wrist blue (Uh)
What's up guy? I miss you (what up?)
And until the day I'm with you
I'ma go hard to convince you
And push on like a pimp do (yeah)
If it went down it was meant to (uh huh)
It'll drive you or prevent you
Me with a instrumental makes it sound so simple
I hold the city down
I'm ridin' with the milly round
Silly clown, I pull the Ferrar up and grill him down
And my ceilings round
30 feet off the ground
30 minutes from the slum
Run when you hear that sound (pow)
Man y'all done did it now
The hottest kid in town (yeah)
Right on your fucking heels (YEAH)
Run on and tuck your tails
You thinkin' couple dollars
I'm thinkin' couple mills
So my belt buckles froze
Man I just fuck these ho's
You see my hearts been cold
Since I was nine years old
Bold, yet underage
Mind on another page
Eyes red as my grades
Stumbling through a phase
Momma did all she could
Shit ain't do no good
See once your lines flat
There ain't no coming back
They don't really want no beef (Nah)
They just wanna rap
And that's my point exact
[?] just run and rat
And you'll be behind a cage
A number on a patch
Your destiny's been snatched
Apparently perhaps
I can make my mark with words
Remember me through raps
So when I walk up
They'll be all stuck
From the porshe up
What it cost? What
Zero in on my zero's and cough up

[Interlude: 50 Cent]
Go 'head, let it out
It's ok to look as stupid as you sound, clown

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I'm nothing like the ones you've heard
I came right off the curb
Made it big and that's deserved
You niggas got the nerve
I gave the streets heat
And delivered each week
The only way we sleep
Is six feet deep
Never bite the hand that feeds
Provides for your needs
We ride till we die
We die, pop and bleed
Until they cock and squeeze
I get the gwap with ease
G's turn to millions
Millions turn into properties
I'm on the road to riches
A row full of six's
I'm cold as the Pole
Won't fold for these bitches (NAW)
The flows brought the ho's
The ho's brought the shows
The show's brought the gwap
The gwap brought the drop
The drop brought the cops
The cops brought the cuffs
But I just bought the law
They'll get me out by four
Now holla at ya boy
Ballin', I get the bread
My weed is purple and my eyes is all red
