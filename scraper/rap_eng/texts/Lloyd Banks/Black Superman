Yeah! ("DJ Whoo Kid! ")
You nigga's know what time it is!
Money bring the hoes!
I always bring the flows. (come on!)
The foes bring out the foes. {Whoooooooooooooooooooo Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid! }
And it goes...
I'll get up In ya household
F*ck everything up a little bit them I'm out slow
And I ain't worried bout the noise, cause she out cold
And I'm 'bout dough! - The same nigga from the intro to outro;
Hoe! - Black Superman! - Chinchilla for a cape
G-4 when I sore - back an' forth the tour; ("DJ Whoo Kid! ")
Boy! - My reign Is sumthin you can't ignore
And after +The Rotten Apple+ you'll understand it more
I'm a G-Unit nigga, nigga you know what it is!
Queens/SouthSide representited!
And when it's all over, you'll remember what I did
Took a 16 and flipped it into a crib
The best puss' sing; can't you hear the chicks scream?
My sounds good as money. - I'm underground king! (KING!)
You can tell I'm doin' my thing by the ring
I get It how I spit it - that stop and stare gleam
I don't handcuff no bitch! (handcuff no bitch!)
I care about everything but that bitch! (but that bitch!)
You could tie her up and gunbutt that bitch! (gunbutt that bitch!)
It won't be no reward I don't love that bitch! (love that bitch!) - F*ck that bitch! (f*ck nigga!)
I chase the money. - The money bring the hoes! (bring the hoes!) {Whoooooooooooooooo}
I chase the money. - The money bring the hoes! (bring the hoes!) {Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid! }
I chase the money. - The money bring the hoes! (bring the hoes!)
