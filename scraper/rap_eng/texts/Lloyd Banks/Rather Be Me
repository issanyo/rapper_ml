The Unit
Yeah
There's a lotta things in this world you can be
But I hate to be you nigga
You're not true

[Verse 1:]
Uh...
All it is is murders and burglars around my way
Poverty society climbing up every day
Honesty inside of me probably be what I say
I stay here too long it'd probably come my way
Fiends don't wanna go and get clean they want that yay
Run up on my mansion you runnin' up on the K
Tangueray mixed with that henny and Alize
A hundred dollar bill though, petty, I'm 'bout my pay
Bitch niggas holla my name it's all hate
Money bags and finger pointin' is all it takes
One more step and your steppin' into your fate
Wake up 'fore you can't wake up, you had your wake
Ain't nobody better than Blue or what he do
Fifty put me here, who I'm supposed to listen to
These niggas is scared of The Unit I'm livin' proof
You ain't gotta like me or love me, I love you

[Hook:]
If you ever lived a life of a G
Or seen half of the things that my eyes seen
You be just like me
Then you be just like me nigga
If you ever lost something you loved
To a knife, a slug, or white drug
You be just like me
Then you be just like me nigga
But if I had a heart of a fool
Which gives you the audacity to turn on your crew
I be just like you
Then I be just like you nigga(A BIRD)
If nuttin' outta my mouth was true
And I ain't have a clue and a cowards point of view
I be just like you
And I don't wanna be you nigga

I rather be me

[Verse 2:]
New York City is shitty but all I know
There ain't no way to shake it it follows me where I go(go)
Find someone that doesn't acknowledge me for the flow
I can make another believer outta them yo
S-Five automobile that four do'
Boy it's jus' me and my toy, that fo' fo'
Rims pokin' outta my wheels as I peel
Ain't no use in givin' him grills you know the deal
Open up a can of whoop ass then hit the dash
Stick around and watch you take a loss as I laugh
Back on my grizzly who is he to come my way
Homie must be dizzy cause he can get done today
Beef is like a frizbee so throw it it's ok, stay
Low cause it can come back around any day, play
Games at your own risk cause I won't risk it all
Put my life in jeopardy just to ball...

[Hook:]

Some came some went
And this how I vent
