[Chorus]
I guess I'm supposed to be scared (Yeah)
Cause you got toast up in here (Uh-Uh)
Well nigga lets get one thing clear (Yeah)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)
Is it because I'm standin' with your bitch? (Bitch)
Or got all these stones on my wrists? (Bling!)
Don't think you're leavin' here with this (This)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)

[Verse 1]
I'm on another level when it comes to this, cats swung and missed
Strapped under this
Rap's hungriest, top soloist, hopped over this
Cheap imitations try, couldn't find an ice pop colder bitch (wooo!)
Wires get tap, your rep can't control the snitch
Which, means I'm in the BINGE if I throw 'em bricks
I dump karrots in the RING over flow the wrists
Man, I even bring the thing when I go to piss
Look, money ain't a THING thought I told them this
Yo ball big as Yao MING I'm a soldier miss (Yeah)
Only problem in hip hop is waitin'
Known when that butter, I make the strip pop like bacon
Hatin', so look sloppy so I stop get the rolly fitted
Got a fan base in the towns that think Kobe did it (Oh!)
Them dick riders on the block and they starvin'
Give me a year I'll be rockin' the Garden (Uh-Uh)
They'll still be in the bricks
Same bitch, same sloppy apartment (Damn)
Bubble gum on the top of your carpet
Food stains in your clothes
They can't catch him
Dude's changin' his flows more than his hoes (wooo!)
Just got a Range and a Rolls
And these hoes didn't always love me
I was pissin' them off (Uh-Uh)
Cause you got to fuck banks before you get to the boss (Uh-Uh)
Now I've moved up in rank, ice chips in the cross
To see me blow, is like vice grips on your balls (Whooo!)

[Chorus]
I guess I'm supposed to be scared (Yeah)
Cause you got toast up in here (Uh-Uh)
Well nigga lets get one thing clear (Yeah)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)
Is it because I'm standin' with your bitch? (Bitch)
Or got all these stones on my wrists? (Bling!)
Don't think you're leavin' here with this (This)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)

[Verse 2]
I was destined to swim backwards in cash
Since the day I was smacked in the ass (Yeah!)
Give me that blue kush in the booth and I'll be back in a flash
First week I'll be platinum and half
Going hard in the yard
Still hungry like I'm back in the draft
Same shitty attitude Cadillac in the stash (Uh-Uh)
It's the critically acclaimed, lyrically inclined (Yeah)
And I'm easily influenced, keep my name out your rhymes (Yeah)
Nowadays niggas tell, your own boss set you up (Uh-Uh)
Like Avon and Stringer Bell (Whooo!)
I'm from the ghetto like Akon so bring a L (Yeah)
You're worthless, like a weddin' ring in a cell
Hell all day I'm blowin' dope (Dope)
See the aroma on my coat?
It's stronger then second hand smoke
When I toke, I blow it in the sky for the slaughter (Uh-Uh)
For every mother and daughter that died in that water (Yeah)
For that little girl playin' outside when they caught her (Yeah)
But was suppose to hit the guys on the corner
I make the heads bop in the streets like speed bumps
Cause every bar hit ya, hard as a Muhammad Ali punch (Whooo!)
My bitch got an ass about as wide as a tree trunk
She hit once, Ithink about her for 3 months
Don't you know my nigga L pop off wigs?
Leave 'em in the grass and say hi to their kids (Yeah!)

[Chorus]
I guess I'm supposed to be scared (Yeah)
Cause you got toast up in here (Uh-Uh)
Well nigga lets get one thing clear (Yeah)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)
Is it because I'm standin' with your bitch? (Bitch)
Or got all these stones on my wrists? (Bling!)
Don't think you're leavin' here with this (This)
I don't leave the block without my Glock (Glock)

[Talking]
Yeah!
Your boy Banks nigga
Gangrene nigga
You know the team nigga
G-UNITTT!!!
Shady
It's over
Nothin' else wins!
