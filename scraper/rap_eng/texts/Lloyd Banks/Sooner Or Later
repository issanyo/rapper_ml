[Intro]
I know that sooner or later
I'm going, to meet my maker

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I never thought in the beginning I would see his fall in the end
Pay a man to paint pictures on the wall of my friends
1990s sins it was all for tha ends
Ends for the rims, rims for the Benz, Benz full of skins
'Fore you talk about money, make a mil first
You don't dig me, sig me, either kill me or get killed worse
Your song's in need of a real verse
Son of the man, God feel me like he feel church
And right after speech time, it's sparking the street crime
Niggas throwing anything at you, except a peace sign
Live by the gun, die by the gun
'Til my time come, I'mma spend time with your son
I can just see them sad when they remind you of them
Them would've did the same thing, We're confined to the slum and those that don't adapt are either blind, deaf or dumb
Spine of a squirrel, mind of a girl set to run

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Why run nigga?
It's gon' come nigga
But 'til the day it does
I'mma hold my shit down, take it in blood
Outsiders get no love

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Fishin' in a swamp in a desert, Lizard sweater
Half a billy in fives, 2 macs in da ride
They call him Coke-Komo, Co-signed by kings in the rich homo
Made me 3 mil in a month, Pockets mumped
Ferrari still by tha projects buildin', real dot tech ill
They dumb out wit uzi’s and wheels yo
Steak’ll take meetings, beefin' too much dough — the legion
Bat in my hand — the sweet eastern
Losing money fellas, we won’t have that, better grab that
Or don’t come back, or get clapped at
Me and my vixens in tha kitchen
One sucking dick — I paid to her ass shots and sent to the Brinxton
Dons eating calamari, coke in a lawry’s jar
Never broke, hardly rob, eat with the godly’s god
Get wit the gods or get wit the mob
From Shalom to queens, we wild wit the beams

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Don't blame me, blame Southside
That's what made me ma, crazy high
But I’ll spot a traitor out my lazy eye, ladies spy
I’m the one you wanna have that baby by — Maybe I'm
Better of alone, Keeps me in my zone
Nights roam, white patron, GT in my chrome
Alien phone home, ET in my throne
I achieved what they wanted, ease into they stomach
When you broke time slow, but ya weeks are numbered
And bad news keeps you weak and numb
Like when i lost my old man, Damn near threw up the whole weekend son
I shoulda listened, friends turned foe, was told so
The fo' fo' make a nigga run like Ocho - cinco
In my mink ho I'm a protege of pimpin'
Livin' for the sippin', now that they rolled away to Clinton
Marijuana shippin' Champagne lobster shrimpin'
Game trained not to listen, maintain pop the clip in

[Hook]
