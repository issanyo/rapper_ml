[Verse 1]
I’m ballin' like I used to
That dough coming bookoo
And my diamons coloured new blue
Got these bitches going' coocoo
Bag ‘em up when they chuchu
Amtrack on these hoes
Cheesing like the Packers
‘Cause I’m packing up these shows
How the fuck am I supposed to rememeber
Who I bone? Probably won’t
When you broke, bitches said you eat they smoke
Now they don’t, now they kneel
Kiss my feet or hit the street, how it feel?
I’m a real motherfucker, chasing a dollar bill
Drunk as fuck and I’m smoking
Trunk her up and I’m hoping
I can get her back to my room
With this video girl I’m pocking shit
I’m getting head right now
This supposed to be work?
I'm laughing hard at these chicks
That think they getting close to me, nope
They said, I ain't fucking with who? That’s supposed to be jokes
Still be three weeks, and three tweets
They get a whole of these quotes
Don’t know how the hell we floating
All I hope are these boats
Diving into my chevy ridin' round on the spokes

[Hook]
Hey, what you niggas know about this money
The kick, got it ready to go
Hundred miles an hour catch me running
Full speed ahead to the dough
I’ma get it, life without a limit
I just want to live it up
I got the hunger for more
I’ma get it, life without a limit
I just want to live it up

[Verse 2]
I’m stacking on these chips
Producer how I switch the kicks
I flip the whip I'm sicker than sick
I think somebody done slipped me a mick”
Marry come dance with me
You’re like my fantasy
I got all these questions girl
And you got the answer sheet
You know what dude didn't teach
‘Cause ain't no romancing me
The couple out the east
We got the chance to be
I’m out here hitting switches
Front street on the slum
I got a thousand bitches
But you can be the one
I’m put a whoop, you beat that pussy like a drum
‘Til you come ’til you done
Where you from, where you going
And you hit it from the back
Smack it ’til it’s red
Everyday I’m playing I went platinum in the bed
Bombay on my course, 5k on my coat
Five days in my city, that’s five days in her throat
Niggers know what happen just for talking sideways
And they won’t
Better of you don’t, take a hit of this dope

[Hook]
Hey, what you niggas know about this money
The kick, got it ready to go
Hundred miles an hour catch me running
Full speed ahead to the dough
I’ma get it, life without a limit
I just want to live it up
I got the hunger for more
I’ma get it, life without a limit
I just want to live it up
