[Dj Drama talking] :
Don't let em do it to you they'll make you miserable if you let em!

[Chorus] :
Uh!
All this shit don't really mean nothing my word is all I have
Baby we can reach the top if we don't let up off the gas
Keep it realer and then maybe we'll look back at it and laugh And correct all of the accidents that passed
I can promise you, you won't be miserable
Out there hoping that we don't when no idea where we goin
Them bitches pitiful
Yeah, fuck what they talking leave em right where they walked in
That shit gets critical
My word is all I have
Baby we can reach the top if we don't let up off the gas
Keep it realer and then maybe we'll look back at it and laugh And erase all of the problems that we had
I can promise you, you won't be miserable

[Verse 1] :
Long as im livin guaranteed for you i stretch for bars
Strong as my rhythm high vibrations get the mixin
Greatest song ever given
Love notes thrown in the sky for the haters forming consistence
Since i met you you been on one, fine snotty and colder
I ain't out the cloth your torn from, mind body and soul
Vow to always lead direction you go
Blind in your goal knowing if I'm up here you do the same thing dominant roll
And this connections no control only the chosen
You do better then the ones that came before flick is golden
Give it all to just repeat this life be damn i skip a moment
To the mind your like the illest drug define a rare component
You done gave a nigga your soul, won't mistreat or disown it
Could it be a better ending if finding someone to grow with
Dedicated to spoil thee with loyalty your actions fit the slogan I'm in the purest place I ever been immaculate explosion!

[Chorus 2] :
All this shit don't really mean nothing my word is all I have
Baby we can reach the top if we don't let up off the gas
Keep realer and then maybe we'll look back at it laugh
And correct all of the accidents that passed
I can promise you you won't be miserable
Out there hoping that we don't when no idea where we goin
Them bitches pitful
Yeah, fuck what they talking leave em right where they walked in
That shit gets critical
My word is all I have
Baby we can reach the top if we don't let up off the gas
Keep it realer and then maybe we'll look back at it and laugh
And erase all of the problems that we had i can promise you...

[Verse 2] :
You get that healing back when we touch
The realist rush trust will delete all of my fuck ups
Leaving your feelings crushed
Here's to never conceiling stuff
Absence and suffocating even when you drive me up walls passionate trouble making
Crasing burning from the speeding
Guarantees from the waiting long as you lose all that matters Won't alter the speculating
Here's to better days killin em walking no reservation
Two cheers for bitches envying talking with dedication Standing ovations for anybody holding it down I wish you Happiness and laughing trips miracles for your smile
The perfect antidote medicine when your round
And I'm your Glock shell your rock still veteran when in doubt
I need occasions for my damn self never been in the crowd
Even if we caught amnesia and met again it'd be wild
What better protection they let us in with the cal
What consistency got in store better wind in my child

[Chorus 3] :
All this shit don't really mean nothing my word is all I have
Baby we can reach the top if we don't let up off the gas
Keep realer and then maybe we'll look back at it laugh
And correct all of the accidents that passed
I can promise you, you won't be miserable
Out there hoping that we don't when no idea where we goin Them bitches pitful
Yeah fuck what they talking leave it right where they walked in That shit gets critical
My word is all I have
Baby we can reach the top if we don't let Up off the gas
Keep it realer and then maybe we'll look back at it and laugh
And erase all of the problems that we had
I can promise you you won't be miserable
