Whoo, yea, nigga ain't nothin changed, G-Unit's the motherfuckin gang
Yayo these niggas thought I was over
Like like a nigga fell off or something like, like
I don't get paid for this like like is you motherfuckin' stupid
Yea, I'm a show you niggas how to stack
I'm cakin' I get rid of you niggas by the pack
And I'd hate to come off like a sibliminal on a track
With the police listenin' yea, they watch us like that
So I stay on my one and two's
Even watch my numbers move
Why you think we in running shoes?
I ain't like them other dudes
I'm from Queens where fathers leave in vile
And daughters havin' babies cause they in style
We ain't have shit that's why don't smile
Neighborhoods fucked up that's why we all wild
Gutter just blew trial and L got 7 left
So I'm a stunt like hell, so I'm at heaven's steps
And 7 vest hammer proof vest in the sket
Niggas watchin' my brain 'cause they ain't make nothin' yet
I gotta little thin card when I go shop
I swipe it and then cop, then its right back to the block
Gotta swallow your pride, hide and ask him to stop
Got the vision of Rakim and the passion of Pac
I'll put 2 in a goon they'll handle triggers everyday
And they all yellow bucks, like the niggas in a grave
Ay blowing a O a day blowing the dro away
These niggas is little kids go in the stow and play
I get a girl a day, take all your fun away
So if you comin' to beef bring a loaded K
Yea, ya niggas know what it is man ain't shit changed man
Ya forgot, ya can't challenge me or something you bum ass
Niggas better stay as far away from me as possible man
I'm on that new shit on that bullshit man, straight up man
Fuck all the rap talk nigga you won't catch me at the motherfuckin'
Red I'm on a green carpet nigga
