[Verse 1]
You're feeling yourself, you're feeling me
The feeling is strong, it’s clear to see
Ain't no feeling like on top to me and pass down
Possibly, sit down drop the V
I’m tryna drop another one, shit I gotta see
Stuntin’ til the summer come, swagger by the tree
Jugglin' these questions, cause it’s puzzlin’ to me
That baby got a husband and she's riding round wit’ me
Fuck it, I’m just playing my part
I ain't tryna cuff it, can’t trust it
She ballin’ on a nigga budget, touch downs keep her there
Money's the subject
And I’m on another team, gotta love it
She probably try it on me, I wouldn't rug it
Southside stubborn, cold hearted in public
Living without a care, don’t care how you judge it
Tired of hearing what you going through
I does it

[Chorus]
Love shots
She’s firin’ the gun
Probably had a hundred niggas looking dumb
But I ain't the one
Nah, I ain't like them
Matter of fact, I went back on the road when I’m done
G’s up, hoes down
Get paper, smoke pounds
Fo' bitches, fo’ rounds
G’s up, hoes all the way down

[Verse 2]
Maybe I will, maybe I won’t
Maybe I’m better off if I don’t
None of that money is yours, baby, you’re broke
And when that bump sick, your soap back on the rope
Brand new task, cause she’s wonderful with her throat
Cash for the pope, she's coming up with the stroke
Shawty takin’ shots, I duck, dive and dodge
Always on the move girl, I work 5 jobs
I’m a go getter, fly nigga, flow spitter
Game owner, player and a coach hitter
Gold glitter and my CD dope
Lock me up to NYPD, won't probably wanna see me slip
Have a nigga baby, grimy on that greedy shit
Borderline crazy, crazy to not see the shit
Cold hearted, step into the freezer whip
Blue fuckin' Hef, no stress and the weed is lit

[Chorus]
Love shots
She’s firin’ the gun
Probably had a hundred niggas looking dumb
But I ain't the one
Nah, I ain't like them
Matter of fact, I went back on the road when I’m done
G’s up, hoes down
Get paper, smoke pounds
Fo' bitches, fo’ rounds
G’s up, hoes all the way down
