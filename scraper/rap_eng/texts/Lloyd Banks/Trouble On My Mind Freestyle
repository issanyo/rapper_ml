Screws all in the Bentley, get the doctor
Ain't no guarantee, don't trust her, got a pistol for a partner
The way I pop shit hits the competition like a choppa
Tell a bitch quick, don't listen to me, listen to your sponsor
Mr. Poppa in the car, the parking lot ain't far
Take her down to Hollywood, drop right on the star
Heart breaker motherfucker, every night is a scar
You niggas so far behind I can minus a bar
At the bomb of the market you a target
Self inflicted pain til I find someone to spar with
My style dip in caine thats why I come off as a martian
Got a shoe? red carpeted the apartment
My picture's next to cool, im running of an AC
48 hour maximum, she gone on day 3
Making more on an accident, im back in KC
Ain't a motherfucker matching, watch me stack in HD
