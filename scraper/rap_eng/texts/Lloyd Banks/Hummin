[Bobby V]
Can I get you in the bed?
Lay your pretty body on that bed
Girl I am gonna rub my fingers through your hair
And I am gonna kiss you on your neck (yes sir)
Then I am gonna take you out your dress
Then I am gonna move back the covers
Then I am gonna move back the sheets
Then I am gonna lick it
Then I am gonna kiss it
Then I am gonna let you back it up on me

[Bobby V - Chorus]
Girl, we're gonna be hummin'
It feels so good, don't stop
Girl we're gonna be hummin
Girl now let me go back on top, top, top, top
Sex so good when we make love
Girl you can't do nothing but harm
I've been waiting all day
Trying to get in those jeans girl
Ain't no need to run
I am gonna hear you say oooh oooh ooooh
I wanna hear you say oooh oooh ooooh

Round one round two
So many things I am gonna do to you
Now it's time to take it to the kitchen
Then I am gonna take you to the balcony
Then I am gonna take you to the stairs
Then I am gonna take you to the shower
Now pose take a pic let's make a flick
I love the way you back it up on me

[Bobby V - Chorus]
Girl, we're gonna be hummin'
It feels so good, don't stop
Girl we're gonna be hummin
Girl now let me get back on top, top, top, top

Sex so good when we make love
Girl you can't do nothing but harm
I've been waiting all day
Trying to get in those jeans girl
Ain't no need to run
I wannna hear you say oooh oooh ooooh
I wanna hear you say oooh oooh ooooh

[Lloyd Banks]
Six in the morning in the bedroom, performing
Rub her down get her warm and leave her pretty, scurrin
She ain't like the gold diggin ones that want me, I want her
She like the finer things, how ironic I'm a stunner
When im layin I'ma get her to the beach
Quiet sex she prolly sayin sweep the dick right off her feet
Now her hearts right in my hand n its hittin like the beat
Cop a condom, park the Lamb now shes workin on the street on the creep
Straight to the mansion now you naked lap dancing short breast legs crampin beat it up
No lampin she ain't always got the have things romantic she perfect
Think she get it in the strip club how she work it
No playin she gonna get out every drop
I'ma make her say my name put that pussy in the shop
Knock the bed right off the frame till she beggin don't stop
She will never be the same I'ma land her in her spot

[Bobby V - Chorus]
We're gonna be hummin'
It feels so good don't stop
Girl we're gonna be hummin
Girl now let me go back on top, top, top, top
Sex so good when we make love
We can't do nothing but harming
I've been waiting all day
Trying to get in those jeans girl
Ain't no need to run
I am gonna hear you say oooh aah ooooh
