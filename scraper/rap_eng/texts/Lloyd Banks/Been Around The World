This ya nigga Bodie...
Tellin' ya... my nigga, Bank$!
He got a punch! After an other punch, then an other punch, then a punch and an other punch!
Uh! {GOD-... }
Uh-huh! {DAMN! }
Yeah! {CAN'T FORGET... FREE'! }
I'm from the G- U-N-I-to-the-T
And I'm high off the drow teary eyed in the V
With my mind on the dough - nine on my knees. (knees.) {TONY... }
Stash in the car for the NYPD. {AKA... PAPI! }
They love me, they buy my CD
And it keeps me in a very fly GT
The insides leather. - The outsides PP!
Man I'm fly as ever - I pop crisp and eat free. {LLOYD BANK$! }
I've been around the world. - Flew home and went back
Blue guap up on! - Blue stones' my wrist wrap. (yeah!)
Brand new drop on, new chrome I sit back. (back!)
Two tone Mack, I'm two grown for this rap. (whooo!) {Whoooooo! }
You are now rockin' with the flyest
Your highness, my comeback records like Mariahs
I'm rhyme Hot97 radi-o {DAMN! }
Got a monico flow, your tiny bread petty
Boy!
Ugh! {CAN'T FORGET... }
G-Unit! {AXE! }
Yeah... {MY NIGGA KAM! }
"MO MONEY"... PART 4!
LLOYD BANK$... TAKIN' OVER!
REST IN PEACE... RUDE BOY!
