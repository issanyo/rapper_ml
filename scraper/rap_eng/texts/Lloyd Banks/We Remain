[Verse 1]
Yeah...
I wake up out my nightmare, hit the street and see my dream
Most the shit I love is lost through sickness or magazine, Queens
Cali green, clean, panoramic beam
Night-vision screen, helping me to see what can't be seen, mean
Foreign vehicle fiend, since nineteen
The kids see me and scream like I'm selling ice cream, dice king
Gangster till I'm walking with a walker
I turn a chick a stalker, rip all dignity off her
You'll see a flying saucer before you see another Banks
Kaiser Soze with the wordplay I'm everything that you ain't, uh
Chinchilla killer, nigga splash me with the paint, he stomped
Any club I'm in I'm calm, fuck the competition
Purple bottle pissin', getting top from who you kissin'
Listen I will not be locked down and you're in pussy prison
And if your living like I'm living then you live it up
Brand new car, ribboned up, treating life like we don't give a fuck

[Bridge]
Now what it is, staying sucker free tryna live
Kindness is, took for weakness, fuck 'em all, mind my biz
Trust no-one, just my sig, Cigarillo full of hello
Flyer foot, flyer pedal, on my way in out the ghetto

[Verse 2]
Chronic in the Fiji, in a brand new Lamborghini
When you see me it's a half a milli easy, rap need me
I'm so fly, I'm so greasy, and my arm and ears are freezy
Shorty smiling all cheesy, I get her outta her bikini
Easy, fallaci in the 'cuzzi
An inspiring actress dying to make a movie
Groovy, tooly, coochie, hitting til I'm woozy
Rubber-band man, out in Japan, diamonds and Gucci
Nigga sue me, see me when I see ya
When I shit it's diarrhea, f-follow the leader
Flip, I own a heater, I ain't for faking either
White on black Beemer, vehicle jungle fever
Give me a breather, back up off the boy a bit
That girl you with, broke her fucking neck when she saw the clique
Real baller shit, holiday stunin'
I start my engine with a button close my door with a button
Yeah...

[Bridge]
Paper stacking up so I don't need a thang
The streets are going dumb again, we to blame
Other crews come and go, we remain
You can see them other niggas, niggas can't see the game

[Outro]
Nah...
This that V5
Top five dead or alive
Uh... Yeah...
Southside I see you
Northside I see you
Up top I see you
Down south I see you
G-G-G-G-G-G-UNIT!
