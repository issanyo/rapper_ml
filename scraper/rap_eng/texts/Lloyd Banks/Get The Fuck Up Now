[Verse 1]
Banks is gettin' money, money ain't gettin' him
Him sittin' his whip on 23 inch rims
Why would I spend my money on tints
Cause I got my bombers hooded up in your lawndas
The cribs is bigger than my mama's
With that you can send your local high school or college
Your year is expired you should pay knowledge
A hood nigga way out in the bahamas
On tour so you probably won't find us
In your barber shop i got a barber with liners
Banks grew kinda hard with piranhas
My closet is the size of a clothing designator
You're now rockin' with New York City's finest
Shuttin' down the clubs a bunch of niggas went behind us
Now I'm dealin' with a bunch of prima donnas
Take 'em to the crib and have em bend over for recliners

[Chorus]
I need y'all to get the fuck up now
I know theirs gangstas in this town
So throw up your set, come to the front
Show me somethin' yeah that what i want
I need y'all to get the fuck up now
I know how y'all get down in this town
So lit up your weed,come to the front
Poke it out yeah that what i want

[Verse 2]
I'm fresh breast like million bucks
See my green chinchilla and my trillion cuts
Inspired by the niggas that i trust
So if you my shit then you should buy buck's
There alot of rappers let off steam
Cause I'm gettin' money and my jewelry all green
Some of the brightest shit you ever seen
My whole team so fresh and so clean
Down south where they sippin' on lean
Little aks stray hit you wit the beam
I'm a bachelor, I ain't lookin' for a queen
A Southside baller the "American Dream"
Bein' nosy will get you behind beams
So if ain't your beef try not to intervene
I got a pack of Mary Jane in my jean
If i blow it in the sky we will all be high

[Chorus]
I need y'all to get the fuck up now
I know theirs gangstas in this town
So throw up your set, come to the front
Show me somethin' yeah that what i want
I need y'all to get the fuck up now
I know how y'all get down in this town
So lit up your weed,come to the front
Poke it out yeah that what i want

[Verse 3]
I'm hot nigga the fools ain't the same
I'm speedin' you could fuck hoes in my lanes
I got a couple loose screw in my brain
I die on over this, I ain't goin' to move with my chain
You caught brick but who is to blame
Your fans turn their back now I'm you and it's a shame
I'm thinkin' about flyin' to Hawaii
Sippin' on colada, lyin' with a hottie
I'm up top drinkin', niggas in here schemin'
So I ain't leavin 'cause I'm here with my gat
Lay low for a second and get your attention
Now back on the bench and, I'm back
And your fan blades spinnin' on a Lac
And you can't see the side 'cause the window all black
I had respect but I take it all back
Cause you're celebrity wander around with a rat

[Chorus]
I need y'all to get the fuck up now
I know theirs gangstas in this town
So throw up your set, come to the front
Show me somethin' yeah that what i want
I need y'all to get the fuck up now
I know how y'all get down in this town
So lit up your weed,come to the front
Poke it out yeah that what i want
