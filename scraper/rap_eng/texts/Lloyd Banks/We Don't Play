Do the same thing, get the same results
Creeping like Batman, stronger than The Hulk
Running to the bank teller, dump it for the vault
On my town shit, Ben Affleck
Whole nigga cause most men just half-step
I ride hard motherfucka and I ain't crash yet
You don't know, or you do know
I'm like Mario Puzo with Cujo
You don't get it? I'm a prolific animal, every verse flammable
Weird like Murdoch, thinkin' like Hannibal
Man like Face but I'm wild like B.A
Bullets to your head when you talkin' to the D.A
Talking to the judge, and I be in the cab cause I think the car bugged
I don't play with hard luck
Killing your homeboy now you call it hard love
Treat you like a blunt how I'm getting you sparked up

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]

Nigga we don't play! We handle problems the worst way
We'll get you shot stabbed robbed on your birthday
Nigga you ain't got no business 'round here in the first place
Look at everybody chilling - well fuck that!
I'ma play the villain - fuck that! I'm here to make a killin'
All money's good money, weed and liquor stealin'
Small money, tall money, nigga we want it all
Left hand on the wheel, other hand on the draw

[Lloyd Banks]

Needle icepick through your writing hand
Heart like a rock, hard to drop like Spider-Man
Park your pretty cars up, hop inside the rider-van
Hunt ya like Worm for a couple hundred dollar fam
Drive of a street lord, knowledge of a college man
Almighty dollars get you dead, make your momma plan
Nothing like the sound of dough, I'ma make the commas dance
Numbers jump high, numb and drunk in my drama stance
The no fly zone, you don't get a city chance
Show up at your show, make you hoes piss your skinny pants
I'm with blammy so my haters can't stand me or jam me
I'm running niggas over like Brandy
Motherfuck a Grammy, give me weed and eye candy
Coca-Cola daughter, pussy from a very nice family
Won't last stepping in the street without the swammy
From Southside to Y.O., niggas die daily

[Hook]

[Styles P]

I'm hard in the problem like algebra
Only use the gun if it's a high enough caliber
You ain't a Dodge car then you ain't no Challenger
Play wit'cha life nigga but you ain't no gambler
Die any day of the week, go get a calendar
Harder than Russian roulette, nigga fuck a Gillette
I take a gun and put a Buck to your neck
Or a 50 to your grill, bring the blicky to the hill
These young niggas is buggin', tipsy off the pills
I bring the fire like a motherfuckin' Bic lighter
Paper shredder eraser to any sick writer
Ghost is the Apocalypse, hole in your esophagus
Runnin through the shit like a motherfucking rhinoceros
Nasty like a hippo is, show you what a sicko is
Barrel to your girl clit, bitch is you ticklish?
You gon' fuck around and get, burned like syphilis nigga

[Hook]
