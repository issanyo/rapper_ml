[Verse 1:]
Tag popper (yeah!) fresher than baby when I leave the spot
Glass shopper look around for hours and ain't even cop'. (whooo!)
You need to stop! - Shit, get low it's operation squeeze the block (yeah!)
You'll take a knee believe or not, can't wait to see they grieving stop. (yeah!)
Black lungs, shriveled liver ,hardly ever sobered up
Ride 'round with the top down, it's hot now, and I'm loaded up (what?)
I ain't no fucking daddy!
I ain't gon' hold 'em up
I'm frozen up and foes end up in bags for bodies close 'em up. (whoo!)
My hairs are grey, years went by my right guy ain't here today
Sick of momma crying Gucci wipe her tears away
The Uzi ride, I'm here to stay! Jacuzzi high if there's a way
I'm headed! - If you want it - come and get it! - You'll be moved today!
You's the prey! - Imsa boss, you'll be fucked up lose you play
Around you'll be found on the ground made a movie, hey! (hey!)
Louis slips and movie scripts. Oh, you high - usually bitch!
Princess cuts and boobies hit, my jewelry sick man you the shit
Future whips and Ruger clips they envy and I'm use to this (uh!)
Refuse to miss I cruise the bricks, my hats are four, my shoes are six
I bag ya girl and use her lips remove the bitch - who cool as this?
Scrambling maneuvering, my mans is on that stupid shit. (shit!)

Chorus:
(He know...) I got a stack! (He know...) - I'm 'bout that!
(He know...) This spot is mine (He know...) - I want it back! (I'm BACK!)
(He know...) I'm never scared (He know...) - I keep that Gat!
(He know...) I'm more prepared (He know...) - just how to act
(He know...) My hearts black (He know...) - I ain't the one!
(He know...) They got my back (He know...) - They'll leave him done
(He know...) When niggas come (He know...) - he better run!
(He know...) He on that bullshit (He know...) - Don't fuck with son! (He know...)

[Bridge:]
They gon' have to lay me before I lay them
I think I'm going crazy, oh they know
I walk around hazy, oh they know
A nigga try and play me, oh they know
