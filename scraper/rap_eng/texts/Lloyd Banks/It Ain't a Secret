[Hook]
Lately, I've been hearing a lot of things that I don't agree with
And it ain't a secret
Everybody know you puss, nigga
You ain't a gangsta' you a wuss
What makes ya feel comfortable enough to call my name out like ya know me?
Nigga, I ain't cha homie
I got a 4 pound on me
And you can have it

[Verse 1]
This here make ya piss in ya sweats
You know me. Mitchell and Ness, Smithin and Wess, Pistol and vest
I take ya life with a sound, I got the whistle of death
Ya boy flow put the Crystal in Meth
Take the listeners breath
You won't believe what they do for cock
I hit the telly thrash, and slide off before the rooster crock
Pour out some liquor for Big, let off 2 for Pac
Don't mingle around niggas, shoot off the roof a lot
Fuck rattin, every tooth is locked
And you co-operating, helping 'em damn near recruit the block
I'm blowing heavy on the sofa with the dessie
Just in case a nigga soft enough to slip through the crack
I'd rather throw some at you then get my shit blew back
This is hardcore pitbull rap right out the track
The hood a bring the bitch out for ya
Man, I get the Glock
My money flip like fish out water, yeah!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm staring to feel like I got it all sewn up
I helped raise a few of these niggas, now they think they all grown up
See these DVD G's is pissed off behind the scenes
Spoon fed niggas, clit soft as Lima beans
To be real, I dont know why I'm even trippin'
'cause we run this shit, like diarrhea drippin'
The breads long, the pipe big
So I'm comfortable enough to got to court in my PJ's like Mike did
I move around with the sket, the long Maglees
So chill, 'cause you can't block those wit Shaun Bradley
I'ma still be here when D-Block flops
I got more cash than them in my Reebok box
I brighten up the picture, I shine bright
Standing in my way is the only way to be in the lime light
I'm lazy when i hit and run
Which means you gon' get to cum, even if you dont get to come

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Niggas stiff when i pass
'Cause I'm on a spaceship on wheels
First to death, little dude couldn't slip on pills
And you a bitch, all you gotta do is slip on heels
Cheatin on me, 'cause the house on the cliff costs mills
I get the brush on ya, give the clique boys chills
Man, there won't be no more songs steak sauce spills
I get the bills, young black entrepre-nigga
Strapped with a vest armed with a trigga
I run and got a twin tag-along, the bitch is a quarter
I don't mind to split 'em up, blood's thicker than water
So I capture all the episodes on the camcorder
She lick it of her stomach, right after i blam on her
I turn the corner with the Mack Daddy lip
Supa fly, black Larry Flint in the bed
I thought about clapping Joe, but why clap him with the iron?
He one Big Mac away from dyin'

[Hook]

[Outro]
I got it on me nigga
Man fuck you niggas, fuck around and buck you niggas
Rap would be over
Man fuck you niggas, fuck around and cut you niggas
My career would be over
Man fuck you niggas, fuck around and buck you niggas
No more shows
Man fuck you niggas, fuck around and touch you niggas
And you'll tell
