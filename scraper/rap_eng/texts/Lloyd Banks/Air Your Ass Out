[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
We in the '64, air horn blowing at my enemies
Bulletproof cap, I ain't going out like Kennedy
50 got my fanbase growing out in Tennessee
I'm getting so much head it's drawing out my energy
I'm touring now, I need enough weed to pass around
Somewhere around a half a pound of that Manhattan brown
Bitch, I'm gonna sell records, I got a platinum sound
Ranned into half the town bandana wrapped around
Nah, we ain't got no manners
And as far as the clips you know how gorillas feel about bananas
Acknowledge whenever we round
And as far as bouncing back I'm like Ben Wallace on the rebound
You still spending 10 dollars on your weed, clown
You might lose your dick, it's all kind of disease now
They ain't OG's, they grumpy, old men
Riding 'round in a chunky old Benz, nigga, those ends
I'm not the type to fall in love, make your hoes friends
I turn a friend to a ho, spend all the dough
Niggas'll start fighting by the end of the show
I got 30 niggas on stage and 10 in the row, ya know

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Get ya gun, we gon' come for you, we'll lay ya ass out
The shells hit you knees, split ya, there's blood all on your couch
Didn't think niggas would really run up in your house
Hog tying ya mutherfucking kids and ya spouse
Bitch, give us the mutherfucking money and we out
This 45th shell'll tear a fucking hole in ya blouse
Waiting for me to have a change of heart, you assed out
Kill every motherfucker up in this bitch and stamp out
Nigga, this is pressure, punks respect pressure
Catch ya stunting in something I want and I'll get ya
Go 'head ride through ya strip in your Benz on chrome
See if I won't run up in your motherfucking home
They say money make the world go 'round
I've seen my knife work, I turn a clown smile to a frown
Squeeze and watch the barrel spin on the trey pound
I'm a G-Unit gorilla, niggas know how I get down
