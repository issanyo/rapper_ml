I’ve been doing me
Making the haters mad
Pop tags everyday
I am gonna show my ass
Photogenic swag
Get automatic cash
Big wheel on the front
200 on a dash
We’re running the streets
Tell the niggers hang it up
Diamonds on my neck
You see my niggers tatted up
Meet me in the club
Never catch me at the bar
Call a waitress
Tell her bring me the bar
Couple years OG gave me the word
Stop screwing birds start moving birds
So I put it down
I am the hottest in the hood
If you are looking for me
It ain't hard
I am in the hood

Chorus

I am the realest
I am the realest
If you are looking for that …
All these hoes up in here know im the realest
I am the realest
I am the realest
(repeat)

BANKS
You can meet me at the top
And every weekend spend
.. make my cd about to drop
Put your TV must have seen me on a block
I got south Jamaica shit with me
..put the strippers in the trunk
.. don’t tell them what I spend
..the clock is ticking
I am on my way
.. kusch you can smell it when I pass

Chorus

.. ain’t nobody winning
Somebody is losing like a mother fucker
.. smoking on .. sack the smell on my face
Heard your boys didn’t make it
You should never tried out
Getting money over here
..

Chorus
