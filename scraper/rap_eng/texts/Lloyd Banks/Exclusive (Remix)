[Intro: Avant]
We don't need a video tape or a camera to make this ghetto love scene

[Verse 1: Avant]
Was like a dream when I first met you, your face and your stature
The way you carry yourself, it really turn me on
You controlled myself, had me in a zone
Caught starin in your eyes, feelin like when doves cry
And the smile on your face that you had for me
And let me know you can't wait to get next to me

[Chorus: Avant]
(Givin you all of this) Girl you know
(Nothin is better than) The way I do it
(Girl you know what it is) You know what it is
(The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive)
(Givin you all of this) Girl you know
(Nothin is better than) The way I do it
(Girl you know what it is) Whoa oh oh
(The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive)

[Verse 2: Avant]
Paper denim crisp Timberlands (Check!)
Purple labeled ice glistenin (Yeah!)
(They say diamonds are a girl's best friend!)
I can see it in your eyes that you get down to ride
The way you move your body made me want you more
(I can and vision me, hittin it, that's what I'm, gettin at)
Like a fire, up in here (Woo!)
Let me hit that, get that, split that, wanna rush that, bless that, crush that
Oooh I ain't playin no games wanna tear it out the frame
We can start in the Range I'll be..

[Chorus: Avant]
(Givin you all of this) Girl you know
(Nothin is better than) The way I do it
(Girl you know what it is) You know, you know
(The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive)
(Givin you all of this) Girl you know
(Nothin is better than) The way I do it
(Girl you know what it is) Nothin is, better, better
(The whips, the chips, everything is exclusive)

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
You know the kid keep somethin in the whip (Uh Huh)
Green rocks drippin off of me I'm stuntin in my fit (Yeah)
They give me the same thing you handcuff 'em to get
Cause I'm so fly (Fly) That's why it's nothin to get licked (Woo!)
I'm the product of the hood the pride of Southside (Uh)
This is a Lamborghini that's why your mouth's wide (Yeah)
We could lamp in the villa (Uh Huh) My hands in the scrilla
And your bad enough to turn a jealous man to a killer (Yeah!)
My lifestyle, Cristal and Chinchilla (Uh)
Mansions, luxury cars and four wheelers (Yeah)
I can 'fore wait anything except for my time
She came to give me the ass but I left with her mind
I'm, on the hunt for the right one
Start in the mornin and ain't done till the night come
Either you ridin with me or in somebody's way
Cause all I need is a night (Yeah) And you 'gon think about it everyday I'm...

[Chorus: Avant]
(Givin you all of this) Girl you know
(Nothin is better than) The way I do it
(Girl you know what it is, the whips, the chips, everything is exclusive)
(Givin you all of this) Girl you kno
(Nothin is better than) The way I do it
(Girl you know what it is, the whips, the chips, everything is exclusive)
