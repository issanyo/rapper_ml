You need it, go get it
Seven days committed
You need it, go get it
Seven days committed, nigga
Make money, make money, make money
Make money, make money, make money
Make money, make money, make money
Make money, make money, make money

(Verse 1)
Make money, damn if they gon' take it from me
Super swag, bet I get ya naked, honey
You know my stump ground, South Jamaica, dummy
Ain't no comp round, six or seven acres counting
They mad I got in, never shoot or let me do
Body full of diamonds, hoppin' out the Bentley coupe
Crime high, I'm climbin', the other pockets empty crew
Niggas thought I died then, call me "Makaveli Blue"
Red and green stripes, diamond ear squares
Screaming twin pumps, right off the Lear stairs
I give a fuck about a bitch, you a "Care Bear"
Heart pumpin', anti-freeze as I stand here
Punch a cotto, nightclubs, bunch of photos
Run up on me like a dolo when I'm thumping dolo
Here's a no-no, bigger dollar signs than low-low
Twenty stacks off a Polo when I go on promo

[Hook:]
Make money, although it don't make me
It takes me somewhere you goin' need an AC
They chase me, cause my neck is clear as HD
You can't see, baby, I'm in money waist deep
You should fuck with me, I'mma be that nigga
How ya goin' start acting funny when I get bigger?
Fuck the awards, I'd rather buy me a Coupe
No thing needed, do it all for the loot
We here to make money
Make money, make money
Take money, take money, take money
Great money, in and out of state money
Weight money, Benjamin's straight money

(Verse 2)
Flat party, I'm steamrolling everybody
Maserati, riding is my kind of hobby
White Ferrari, player pressed for pussy, hardly
Ain't no probably, she leave I'mma get a doggy
Bank's AKA ya got nothing for me
Show me thirty, forty more emcees later they will bore me
Delivery semi auti, styles I'll never story
About a thousand they will call me I'mma different category
You playing big, riding round in your family crib
Look at your rib, rock boys understand the kid
We handle shit, play with me, get your candles lit, smoked
Ashes out the window of a brand new six
The hood behind me, move me, you and what army
Armed in Armani, Christian Dior whole army
You owe me sorry's, making money, living calmly
Nicki got me fucking Barbies, cousins and aunties

[Hook:]
Make money, although it don't make me
It takes me somewhere you goin' need an AC
They chase me, cause my neck is clear as HD
You can't see, baby I'm in money waist deep
You should fuck with me, I'mma be that nigga?
How ya goin' start acting funny when I get bigger
Fuck the awards, I'd rather buy me a coupe
No thing needed, do it all for the loot
We here to make money
Take money, make money
Take money, take money, take money
Great money, in and out of state money
Weight money, Benjamin's straight money

You need it, go get it
Seven days committed
You need it, go get it
Seven days committed, nigga
Make money, make money, make money
Make money, make money, make money
Make money, make money, make money
Make money, make money, make money
Yeah! If you ain't making no money, move on, nigga!
You taking up space!
Nigga! Two g's up! Southside on top!
Doe Pesci on the beat! Yeah!
You need it, go get it
Seven days committed
You need it, go get it
Seven days committed
Make money, make money, make money
Make money, make money, make money
Make money, make money, make money
Make money
You know!
