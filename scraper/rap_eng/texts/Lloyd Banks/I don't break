Intro: Wooo! Wooo!...
Yea-Yeah.. Queens
Yeaah.. Queens

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Fuck the limelight and the streamers
I influence the dreamers
Think like a genius
A wizard, like Arenas
Just me and my ninas
One shotgun
The other one's by the penis
Only balls come between us
There's a million fish in the water and i'm workin' the waves
Man my G will make a mermaid open her legs
And if hip hops dead i'm the shot cups
Clear like the system out the Phantom with the top cut
Pop what?
Pop up and get popped on
Kind of like hot corn
Bye don(by dawn), your block gone
A quarter mill to rock on
Heated seats i'm warm
I'm strong, rap don, icon, slash pipe bomb
To get my right hand back, I give my right arm
Gangstas don't mourn all night long
Right?, wrong!
Now the industry is shakey as ever
And everybody ass kissin' ain't makin' it better
Life's a bitch don't let her
Slow down your cheddar
You win some, you lose some go down? no never
Whatever
Ain't shit really changed niggas still actin'
If you really had that many bricks you'd be still trappin'
I must got dummy on my fitted
Man fuck a rap buddy any one of ya'll can get it
All money ain't good money but I want it
You can give me a blood diamond with blood on it
I'll wipe the blood off it
Clean it and cut it 'till it shine then floss it
I'm on my New York Shit
I was cool 'n somewhere down the line I lost it
Ain't have to raise my hand, they forced it

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Its six in the morning awoke by the sound of the pound
Something just went down
Its hot out there, its hot out there, yeah, yeah
My cell phones ringing
Cause the birds are singing
And the messages is filled with hate
But I won't break, I don't break, I don't break

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
You haters can't stand it
But I'm G Unit branded
Thats what I ride for, go in the can with
Don't run up on me with the Van Dam shit
All mean muggin' when you really a fan shit
I rather go out in a blaze your honor, fuck it
Bury me in a Benz with big rims
A pair of black Timbs and the Beverly Twins
Money, Mac-10 and the heaviest gem
In nineteen-eighty two I came through
Bird's eye view
In a Cortez shoe
South Side nigga, nigga who the fuck are you?
You in the wrong neighborhood theres nothin' I can do
Next time bring ya thing, matter fact bring troo
Niggas is old waitin' for dreams to come true
I lost half a crew 'fore I turned twenty-two
So I live life doin' whatever I wan' do.. Buu!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
My cell phones ringing
Cause the birds are singing
And the messages is filled with hate
But I won't break, I don't break, I don't break
Its six in the morning awoke by the sound of the pound
Something just went down
Its hot out there, its hot out there, yeah, yeah
