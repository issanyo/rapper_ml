[Verse 1] :

I've given my younger years to music but it was taking too much
Being every place in the world left me no space to do us
I know I ain't gonna turn or fold the biggest mistakes that you trust
Niggas done learn your way of pay and told em make a few bucks
Flippin through Benjamin's a decade more my thumbs went platinum
Never vacating on my pen loading my guns click packin
Envision the beauty for so hours my enemies can't see
Energy channeled through the gods nobody can't stamp me
The light that led we've been deceiving my discovery stalker
Could it be I'm too much a dreamer maybe I love a bit harder
Could of went diving out this morning, figured recoveries smarter
Part of my history forgives, the other half, see Karma
Are you my nigga? Would you rather see me fall or get bigger?
Funny how real feelings appear when you get all in your liquor
You turnin', memories burnin, lay along with the vermon Thought we'd see eye for eye for certain but guess I had the wrong person

[Chorus] :

In a land of bitten hands and drama open outside
Can I count on you to be by my side?
Would you ride?
Ain't no worry shit get all way blurry
I'll be your guide
The street done raised us up with too much pride
Its do or die
Anybody go against us, the box is up to the sky
Spending my better days high
Anything to make it by
Hundred balls of 145
And this revenge in my eyes
No regrets, no replies

[Verse 2] :

Its two in the morning and I'm lurking
Perfect setting for sketching
Exhibit the essence out my weapon
Second to known being here
Niggas been sleeping on me, haters never gon dream clear
Making these fans one hundreds, waving out that smoke screen, yeah
In a game of underachievers, always believed in myself
Cutting logos and moguls outta magazines on my shelf
In front the radio reciting, lightning struck same spot
Top of the writers chain, I'm rifle flame to cocaine blocks
You choose to chase me, paper trails'll lead to snake ass niggas
Inside of my enemies that's wishing R.I.P.s, no difference
Repeating your wrongs the fastest way to getcha box chose living
Chasing these silly girls your goal, the goal for them's gold digging
Instead of just tryna reach your net, you spent your life goaltending
Ending relationships from foolishness, your trife soul sinning
Dead in the middle of the horror square suffering sorriest and sorrow near and these bitch ass niggas they'll want you outta here

[Chorus X2] :

In a land of bitten hands and drama open outside
Can I count on you to be by my side?
Would you ride?
Ain't no worry shit get all way blurry
I'll be your guide
The street done raised us up with too much pride
Its do or die
Anybody go against us, the box is up to the sky
Spending my better days high
Anything to make it by
Hundred balls of 145
And this revenge in my eyes
No regrets, no replies
