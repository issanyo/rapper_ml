What up nigga?
I see you
In my sweat dreams
And when I wake up, I feel like shit

(Hook x2)
Woke up in the morning with my mind on the murder
Thinking about the get back, and pushing your shit back
Woke up in the morning with my mind on the murder
Mind on the 187

(Verse 1)
Yeah
Why death have to come get him? (why?)
We wasn't done wit 'im (nah)
Pinky rings made him shine when the sun hit 'im (ugh)
I got drunk with 'im, roll up my weed and hit the blunt with 'im
Came up in the same slum with 'im, hung with 'im
Damm, why he ain't have his gun with 'im
I know his personality would've done did 'im
We cut class with 'im (yeah)
Shot dice and got cash with 'im (yeah)
Broke laws and hauled ass with 'im (yeah!)
I'm riding dirty, yeah I'm illegal
Swat team vest on, chrome desert eagle
Fuck sending threats, I'll just see you when I see you
My soul senile, catch you clowns on the rebound
I hate you... It's time for you to hate me now
Catch a H boom somewhere and spin his V 'round
You know niggas do anything to be 'round
CLICK CLACK POW, now you mourn with me now

(Hook x2)

(Verse 2)
When I finally fall asleep, my dreams so sweet
Bunch of young ignorant muthafuckas in the street
Big world, a reality nobody wanna see
Either you rap, shoot, ball or sell D
It's hard to see tomorrow when you stuck on today
That BC bud and Hennessy will take ya troubles away (hey!)
Reminiscing on the pact we had
Whats mine is yours from my bitch down to a half a bag
Excuse me if I come off wrong
But I wish my enemies harm
You can slip away nice and calm
Right in your baby mom arms
Man, call Al Sharpton, get a lil press
Try to figure out what happened to that boy chest
The hood is a mess, nigga should've had his vest
Besides through his death I can get a lil rest
I'm angry and I...

(Hook x2)

(Verse 3)
I wake up out of cold sweats, my eyes red and my clothes wet
There's enemies still breathing, I can't go yet
How I'mma look your mama in the face and tell her?
"It was just the wrong time, right place"
Let her, know she got someone that she can call on
We talked about making a dig, now that's all gone
We go back so long, came up so fast
Not thinking about the future, just tonight's block bash
Until the day I end up dead
I'mma give em hell down here
I bring my thing everywhere
I come from where niggas don't care
Southside Jamaica, It's a do or die thing
Police ain't refereeing you in our ring
I hope wherever you are you're living like a king
Motherfuck a car, a broad, or the bling
I miss you and I...

(Hook x2)
