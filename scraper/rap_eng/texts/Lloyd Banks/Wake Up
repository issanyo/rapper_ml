[Hook]:
I'm getting to the money
The money nice to meet ya
They sleeping on me baby, time to make 'em a believer
All my women right, they run to me on sight
A hundred bottles of champagne, we popping those all night
Not to mention, I'm out here representing
I need pretty shit around me, put them models in my section
All my women right, they run to me on sight
A hundred bottles of champagne, we popping those all night

[Verse 1]:
My pockets swoll up
Haters done try stop me- no luck
I'm cocky- so what?
My life's like one big party rolled up
Look how I'm smoking
Shorty don't and she still choking
I'm talking potent. That secondhand got her open
I'm always frozen
Louis bags to put my clothes in
I'm back to posing. Make her woozie from my mac explosion
Traffic open, I'm running through my rack of Trojans
New money, new girls, even brought back my old one
The street crown I'm rocking, I'll beat down your top 10
Heat round, they watching how I rebound like Rodman
Out in Beantown I'm popping, 103,000 options
Put the weed down I put the hops in with the Queens style I'm boxed in

[Hook]

Savage with that hot flow, everything I do is macho
Walking around with that Yak on, still gotta get that yacht dough
She ain't hot, she got go. She going deep, Flacco
I'm too ready, pronto
These shoes heavy, potholes
I'm hanging out the window with my music up, rude as fuck
We don't play boy
You getting money? Get your shooters up
Everyday I'm moving up, liquor got me torn down
???
???

Fuck with baby, I got that dope you been needing
I got the soul you can feel, it's something you can believe in
I got a pretty selection, I switch 'em up by the seasons

[Hook]

Lloyd Banks' voice is way too raspy and difficult to understand; some of these are probably wrong
