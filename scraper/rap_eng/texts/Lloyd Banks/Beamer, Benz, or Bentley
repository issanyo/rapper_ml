[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
My jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
This scheming don't affect me

[Refrain: Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm so damn high
More than 500 horses when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get your whole damn crew

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Get in my Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, Beamer, Benz, or Bentley
Beat it I bet she let me, she been fiending since she met me
I'm the coolest shit especially when I throw on all my Gretzky
Got my Smith and Wessie to protect me so respect me
This is heavy new Bentley, color vanilla and cherry
Andretti-O Pirelli make a movie out the getty
Where my ring and my confetti, I'm Kobe Bryant ready
Pink Rose and chronic smelly while stumbling out the telly
I'm so fly, I'm so ferry and the way I flow is very
Ginsu or machete, way my pencil move is deadly
Platinum band, platinum bezzie, make a straight girl outta' lezzie
Magazine, mac, benzie keep my windows like the prezzie
Press a button then I'm stunting, my roof look like it's ducking
Meter go 200 something and my trunk do when it's bumping
I am not the one for jumping I will rachet out and stump him
Dump him, nigga you're better off dead, ya money red

[Refrain: Juelz Santana & Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm always high
Got your bitch waving at me when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
My jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley

This scheming don't affect me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Whether Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, I be movin', I be movin'
Making movies Tom Cruisin' if it's action then I'm shooting
Pockets fat, necks studded, boy my nickname should be Ruben
My Colombian connect told me the Mexicans have moved it
And he know just how I get it so we bout to introduce him
Got a girl named Cigar called her that cause she Cuban
Got a black chick that be boostin', got a white girl that be boofin'
Gotta watch her cause she use it but she fuck me like she stupid
And she always ready to give me that becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club ordered bottles see the sparks in the sky
Will have this whole bitch lookin like the 4th of July
But if you pussies get to fronting, and the pushing lead to shoving
We just bussing and we leaving like it's nothing
If it ain't the Gucci or the Louie then it's Polo or it's Rugby
And this bitch I brought with me, she be bagging bitches for me

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
My jeans are never empty, bitch
Beamer, Benz or Bentley

Beamer, Benz or Bentley
This scheming don't affect me

[Refrain: Juelz Santana & Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm so damn high
More than 500 horses when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, everything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get your whole damn crew

[Bridge: Lloyd Banks]
I got a girl named Kima and Kima like Christina
Baby three don't make a crowd it make a sex scene meaner
I just wanna get between her, turn her 'to a screamer
Then it's one, two, I'm through, see ya
I scoop her in my

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
