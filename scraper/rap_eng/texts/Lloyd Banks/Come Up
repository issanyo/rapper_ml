[Intro]
"And now for our feature presentation."

[Verse 1]
Uh, ain't no time for slippin, captain of this boat
You in that water you don't listen, cause I gotta get the dough
I got the mind to get to it, look how I bomb through my music
These old niggas must've forgot, they got Alzheimer's and stupid
I re-up, rhyme and recoup it, uhh, just look at my timing
And I been shinin' since Whoo Kid, uhh, nigga I'm grindin'
Mountain climbin' and I stay fresh
Dominate for business, now my name stretch
Same guy, grey sky, grade 9, great vest
Fuck it, roll up, that's the way I'm livin'
Sucker niggas baby-sittin for my favorite women
Pockets full of C-notes, memories full of I-O-U's
Lou' Vuitton peacoat, sleep with your entire crew
Blue, plug and leave 'em, that's just how I do
Masterpieces every time I drew, Jeffrey Dahmer you
Dining Room and diamond ear, Dinner still McDonald food
Boy don't bring the drama here, heat-seekers follow you
And you, and you

[Hook: repeat 2X]
It's about time a nigga come up, gritty for a lord
Ain't no runnin' out you run up, ain't nuttin treated small
Mine clockin' on the rundown, party 'til it's sun up
Foreign cars kitted - all these bitches gettin' in it

[Verse 2]
Uh, these niggas can't see me, motherfuckin' chief
Three different whores all in my teepee, which one am I gon' keep?
I got the blood of a playa, spend all the money you pay her
Got a mansion from music cause my flow nice as my neighbor
I hit the dope vein (dope vein) the "H.F.M." is flowin', goin Soul Train
(HAM) all on the track in my new rope chain
Bottles of that co-paign, model mami Coke frame
Twenty bands stuffed in Trues, icy wrist, nothing bruised
Every month another cruise, closet damn near closin in
80-90 something shoes, five colors of bud to choose
Big jewelry out in the open, so they wan' judge me
You know the verdict, young black with money so I'm some dummy
Racism, facets of what my grandma seen
Frontin down M.L.K., jammin' while you play that scheme
Smoke in Lamborghin's, South Jamaica man of cream
Style out here'll get you stomped, turn your head to trampoline
Mean!

[Hook]

[Outro]
"November finally finds me here
Just like the trees so cold and bare"
