[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
I'll put it on my life (I'll put it on my life)
I'll motha fuckin' take it there you leavin' out the world tonight
Murder will suffice (murder will suffice)
Live from the hood with nothin' nice shoulda thought twice
Follow no advice (follow no advice)
Around here you gotta make your own way roll the dice
Mind on the heist (mind on the heist)
Down to get it anyway everybody try

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
My sight set on a better me strugglin' to become it
Product fightin' out kitchin' rumblin' in the cupboard
No time to get caught up rather cut up with these hundreds
This is what papa done made me I was [?] than a stomach
Choppin' the wall feelin' my drug go into public
Don't believe in me today don't show up when I'm inducted
You be out here on your fuck shit why would I keep in touch with
If everything's that's keeping you down I feel discuss quick
Close to the edge anyway push me if you want
The 40 a soul snatcher grab a pussy like Trump
Got what you achievin' your life time in the month
Been holdin' back on a ton of shit right time in the dump
I get to blackin' when I want peers dreadin' my come back
Runnin' a nigga shoutin' obscenities [?] is on flat
Get your handle for one stack
[?] your hear your front crack stuck in the sky
All over dumb rap

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
I'll put it on my life (I'll put it on my life)
I'll motha fuckin' take it there you leavin' out the world tonight
Murder will suffice (murder will suffice)
Live from the hood with nothin' nice shoulda thought twice
Follow no advice (follow no advice)
Around here you gotta make your own way roll the dice
Mind on the heist (mind on the heist)
Down to get it anyway everybody try

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
When you been on my darker days I was strugglin'
You be poppin' up as soon as I pop lookin' for somethin'
Need a spray bottle to sanitize the huggin'
Prayin' to God he heal my head you was fantasizing concussions
Said I was in your best interests but wasn't
Now you caught in the vapors and my money fragrance I'm buzzin'
Cousin all I got is thuggin' these drugs and empty nights of clubbin'
Everything up front and direct ain't livin' righteous subbin'
I'm 50 grand through out and [?]
I had a band for every [?] built a prison bring the bricks to me
Ammo by the uzi I'm risky gamble black and choosy
Jury box commando switch the hand to rap and rubies
Step out the movie with shells and chronic smells
Every time I trap you gotta hit rewind shake bells
Fleece sweater my treasure swells
[?] rappin' you tick tockin'
Benjamin's till can't nothin' fit I need a fifth pocket

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
I'll put it on my life (I'll put it on my life)
I'll motha fuckin' take it there you leavin' out the world tonight
Murder will suffice (murder will suffice)
Live from the hood with nothin' nice shoulda thought twice
Follow no advice (follow no advice)
Around here you gotta make your own way roll the dice
Mind on the heist (mind on the heist)
Down to get it anyway everybody try
