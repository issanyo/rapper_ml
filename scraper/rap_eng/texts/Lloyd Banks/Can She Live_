[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Damn man, can she live?
Can she do the thing with the kid?
You tryna turn a ho to a housewife and she wanna go back to the crib
Damn man, is you mad? Tryna send that ass home in a cab?
That pussy worth your whole damn world, that must be the best one you ever had
You looking for a trick then you don’t want me
She tryna get paid and I fuck for free
You a bird nigga you paying her bills
Fucking with me, she lucky she chills

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Hold, hold up, stop, stop the press
Cut the back talk, drop hoes for less
You gonna stay in your line I won’t play with your mind
I’m all day on the grind, I won’t stress
Sexed out cause I’m fucking all night
Screwing all day, I’ma try these new moves on Shay
Tell her call her friend Chante
She gon' bring Kesha and we all gonna party my way
You lost her mind, she eyein' the click, we bond and shit
You know wine and shit, cause if I knew the things you know
You can bet my roll I'm gonna fire her quick
And that go for every nigga I know
G’s don’t follow
Weed got my eyes low
Make her ass feel real good today then leave her tomorrow

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Damn man, can she live?, can she do the thing with the kid
You tryna turn a ho to a housewife and she wanna go back to the crib
Damn man, is you mad? tryna send her ass home in a cab
That pussy worth your whole damn world, that must be the best one you ever had
You looking for a trick then you don’t want me
She tryna get paid and I fuck for free
You a bird nigga you paying her bills
Fucking with me, she lucky she chills

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Boy what’s up with that hate
Hating can’t fuck us up it’s too late
You working on nerves dog you won’t break
You can take all the time you want, she gon wait
You know anything goes when I get them in the game
I don’t know, prolly make a tape
Tape her ass up, make it shake
Put her pretty ass in the doggy bag make her play
4 bad red bones in a row
Bout my dog, I don’t love no ho
Pretty girls wanna be around my show
Nigga no means no cut it out let her go
Living fast, suck my dick slow
That head be the honor roll
Spending whole damn day watching me
That's why she never got time no more

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
