[Hook]
I hit the lick, I'm gone
It's hard enough just hanging on
In this game of the strong who play the pawn?
Swarming you on a day when it's calm
Remain alone
Blood, honor, and karma all part of my favourite songs
I've been down, too long
The only way to pay 'em back's to show 'em
I'ma show 'em all
They don't want me to go
But I'm going

[Verse]
There's a lot of ways to make it
And more ways to lose it
You gettin' to it? Then make it count
I got hallways of music
Big world raised a ruler
My boys knew it and they can vouche
Everybody chasing that money
As soon as it comes niggas act funny
What's the hatin' bout?
Same niggas holdin' ya baby, got the intentions so crazy
Tryin' to get in ya paper route
Ah, I bet the same bitch you trustin'
Got your name up for discussion
Ass bussin' to rock her world
She on the crowd tip
Chicken head and proud shit
Infatuated with foul shit
Diamonds, rocks and pearls, uh
He lost a homie to the same grind
Poison girls, sick to my stomach
Tryin' not to hurl , uh
We live the blood sport, it's game time
Fuck your hood, frame mine
L's get to rock the hood

[Hook]
I hit the lick, I'm gone
It's hard enough just hanging on
In this game of the strong who play the pawn?
Swarming you on a day when it's gone
Remain alone
Blood, honor, and karma what are my favourite songs
I've been down, too long
Only way to pay 'em back's to show 'em
I'ma show 'em all
They don't want me to go
But I'm going

[Verse]
Uh,gotta learn to handle the pressure
You let the industry stress you
You be pushed out before your time
Me, I love that, shout out the heckler
The "money bag collector", "flow-wrecker," with my war design
I ain't changed so where the love go
The hate in the streets too crowded, royal rumble
And I'ma see to it that all you crumble
Racks by the bundle relax while I son you
Big name, bigger tha bounty, The Walking Dead all around me
Change your ways, or be a grave
On chains, alert the county
The same dirt that found me
Still fucked up, repeated days
Cops 'round feel like they want me
Cause my pockets all chunky, money don't change your profile
So they sick, rather me junky
Bustin raps in my bunky, fuck 'em, see my coat, smile

(Hook)
I hit the lick, I'm gone
It's hard enough just hanging on
In this game of the strong who play the pawn?
Swarming you on a day when it's gone
Remain alone
Blood, honor, and karma what are my favourite songs
I've been down, too long
Only way to pay 'em backs to show 'em
I'ma show 'em all
They don't want me to go
But I'm going

(Outro)
I'ma show 'em all
They don't want me to go
But I'm going
