[Intro]
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I beg you write up your list
Break off the motherfuckers proper
Groupies siphoned from cliques
Nigga you always been a hopper
What you hope to turn into then turned on me with a shocker
Boy you've been growing your own bud, you took a swim in vodka
If I come back to this planet, I'll be fresher
Strong as Brock Lesnar
With an army of faithful followers, the shorty mind wrecker
Fuck 'em all and charge the corny con extra
And now you tight but let the .45 stretch us
Spending my mornings tribeca
I got the street shit down with the lock (?)
You're the receiver of 16 slip, crown me the opposite
Sway wait for a minute, finally I commit
He's somebody to cosign my records, gotta leave hostages
Mouth full of (?), flap of bodily consequence
Certain danger to be the remainder, probably hot defense
Bury the field up on rappers, follow me out the stench
Shame when you
The uncontainable product be (?)

[Hook]
That fucking round'll finish you
Trouble will come at you directly, out here ain't nothing subliminal
The aftermath is criminal
Just get your money, mind your business, you're talking more than the women do
Compensate for tough beginnings
I'm thinking S-Class, neck flash, best grass, and all year winning
Break the door and let my niggas get in
Something gotta give quick, living like it's no limits in him

[Verse 2]
Marijuana scholar, relax, can't take my love from 'em
Barbaric activity, we can bang over one color
Shorty spot the kid and went stiff, you think I stun gunned 'em
Pocket knife and load in my fist, take out the club rumbler
Marble ganja dressed past, perfect to split your brain over
Only right I test your glass, Rollie rocket flamethrower
Police out the plane close ya, throw me out the Range Rover
Lowkey I remain Cobra, won't leave out the game sober
Gotta be hands on with the paper, money counter pet peeve
Been everywhere at least twice, still landing back to Benz breeze
Rapping and quibbling to (?) 10 keys
My horror aura scares mic stylers and the MCs
I'm feasting lovely every night, you on a fast food budget
Body a rook and change your life, then you get tattoos of it
Finesse my album on the crack stoop blunted
And (?) my last few summers (?)

[Hook]
That fucking round'll finish you
Trouble will come at you directly, out here ain't nothing subliminal
The aftermath is criminal
Just get your money, mind your business, you're talking more than the women do
Compensate for tough beginnings
I'm thinking S-Class, neck flash, best grass, and all year winning
Break the door and let my niggas get in
Something gotta give quick, living like it's no limits in him
