[Chorus]
(The only thing I had)
My word, few niggas from the curb
That's all a family deserves
(You don't know the half)
The nerve to speak behalf a nigga
You don't know this, that, and third
(You can never last)
Walking in my motherfucking shoes, find your own path
(Give me mine in cash) you know
You overlooked nobody, back the fuck up real slow

[Verse 1]
Uh, losses just make it tougher survival made us
Catch you at the gates, cross my heart, hope to die with haters
Crew all kind of dangerous and nominators
Your rhyme courageous 'til your in between the hostage stages
Sharpen everything, I got a new box of razors
Metal out the ranges anybody gets the Glocks contagious
Don't lose your lid today, a violent giveaway
I'm built with under armor throw a shot it'll probably ricochet
Time to time the fuck out, call me a business play
Pussy comes with progress drop it watch the bitches stray
Venom shots for a block of vein how can I complain
Flashin knots profit not the same that's my pocket change
Mourning headed niggas drop your plane feel my rocket flame
Million I remain, pot of pain filled with rock cocaine
Bitch niggas spotted I got a spot to claim
Make it from the bottom you never look at the top the same

[Chorus]
(The only thing I had)
My word, few niggas from the curb
That's all a family deserves
(You don't know the half)
The nerve to speak behalf a nigga
You don't know this, that, and third
(You can never last)
Walking in my motherfucking shoes, find your own path
(Give me mine in cash) you know
You overlooked nobody, back the fuck up real slow

[Verse 2]
The sight of ass kissing I regurgitate
Wish I could X 'em all myself release the murder rate
The casualties deserve the fate, penalty disturb the gate
I'm strapped chilling blue steel, red beam, Cali green and The Purple Tape
Streets talk, I heard the hate
You wanna knock down what we built up
Weird squares can't eat off the circle plate
You stick around giving fake pounds, pretending type
Still count on the next man money and wouldn't spend it right
Mr. Wayne of the game, shine my emblem bright
Globe stomping grounds in my boots, Louie in the mics
They wanna box you out for winning
'Cause you don't yes man and views don't expand popular opinion
When you knocking on a million, everyone at your door
Hoping hands out, so they don't got petty crime anymore
I got bills that'll turn the blocks, every diamond's a score
Mattress covering C-notes, Desi', nine and the four

[Chorus]
(The only thing I had)
My word, few niggas from the curb
That's all a family deserves
(You don't know the half)
The nerve to speak behalf a nigga
You don't know this, that, and third
(You can never last)
Walking in my motherfucking shoes, find your own path
(Give me mine in cash) you know
You overlooked nobody, back the fuck up real slow
