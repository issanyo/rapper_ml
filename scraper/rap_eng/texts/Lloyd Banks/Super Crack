[Verse 1]
Tension in the spot now, South side in the house
Pretty fucking pops when I get topped right on the couch
Bitches eyes popping, cause I popped in unannounced
I am fresh from the dealer, We gonna inhale a whole ounce
Full accounts, pouring the King bubbly love me
Three at a time juggling, mink cover the snubbie
Diamond rings and blondie flings, I'm fly as Armani wings
Crack flow and I'm on that Marley Green, I'm Charlie Sheen, winning
Turn the VIP into sinnin', that last round got me spinning
But I wake up with these women, lingerie eating bombs away
Make up on the linen, 6 rounds, revolver day
Break her when I get in, Game spitter, my mind deep I take these bitches swimming
Fuck them love them forget them, let the naked pictures get them
Good chronic for hard living and exotic cars driven
Bar sitting, star shitting, when my album starts shipping

[Hook]
Trip on we ain’t tripping, So much money we tipping
Bitches and bottles popping, Boy left foot is forbidden
Benjamins with no limit, Spend them soon as we get them
Take them back to the future, it's feeling like the beginning
I'm back, back to the top with it, drop kidded
Ey' day on that bullshit, the block did it
Uhh, so I guess I owe you one, Now watch how I get some

[Verse 2]
Upgrading all gears, gearing up for the summer
Stalkers from the winter, Now tearing them up with the lumber
I wonder if I get that feeling before my numbers
Called for me to go under, through four seasons a stunta
No need for a pun, to create a hit, make it stick
Take the flick, front and flicking ashes off my favorite whip
Boom Bap from Bentleys making the neighbors sick
They rather me in a coffin, cuz I'm horsing shit
New year, I'mma bring it in like the old me
Frozie, rats by the shell where the hoes be
We drinking all night, reflect on it the morning after
Your girl of beauty, I met, charmed, and autographed her
The more the millions of dollars, the more the laughter
Four wheelers, Impalas, I'm balling past ya
Only himself can stop him, he got the town popping
Rubber band snapping, I land and hit the ground shopping

[Hook]
Trip on we ain’t tripping, So much money we tipping
Bitches and bottles popping, Boy left foot is forbidden
Benjamins when I'm in it, Spend them soon as we get them
Take them back to the future, its feeling like the beginning
I'm back, back to the top with it, drop kidded
Calm down that bullshit, the block did it
Uhh, so I guess I owe you one, Now watch how I get some
