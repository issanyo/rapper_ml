[Intro: Drake]
Valuable lesson man I had to grow up
I'll never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Chorus: Drake]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'll run my blade across a nigga ass (real quick)
I'm so for real I'm on some real, real nigga shit
You playing, boy, I'll get you hit (real quick)
You better hope the paramedics come (real quick)
Got me fucked up if you thinking it's different now a nigga rich
Before I get to cutting know you niggas better cut the shit
Boy, you gon have ya head popped, pull a trigger for me
And my little niggas trigger op like it's legal, homie
No gang when I bang, boy, I empty the clip
You run like a bitch, you ain't 'bout that shit
Hey, hey, hey, I'll catch you another day, day, day
It's the Unit back to the bullshit

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Nothing in life is out of bounds
AK hold about a hundred rounds
60 shots like KD at the Rucker's
Okay when I see you on respirators
Southside nigga 'til the day I'm gone
Indulge in the violence when the drama on
Yeah, these rap niggas lukewarm
I'm two sleeves of dope when the mic on

[Chorus: Drake]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
Don't Tweet me, see me when you see me
Down to make the news just to say that I'm on TV
This clip rated R, niggas PG
Them shells burn like a bootleg CD
Fuck love, I want the money
When you get too much of it they gon' say you acting funny
"Kidd, how you feel now that the Unit's back?"
Like a million bucks, motherfucker, do the math

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
Coldblooded, boy, my heart don't feel shit
Get with me, ask 50, I take the hit (real quick)
Balenciagas you could still get your ass kicked
Take a rapper nigga bitch and make a real flick
I know I'm different from what you usually been dealing with
Don't need a mic, give me some white to make a million with
Single burrough, 6 shots on the Brooklyn Bridge
I let the nigga Drake tell you what I just did

[Chorus: Drake]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

[Verse 5: Lloyd Banks]
Nigga, getting money new to you
I give a fuck if shit get ugly, it'll be a beautiful funeral
You fit the script I'm gon' assume it's true
Can't manuever through the street without a strategy
Ain't nobody to tutor you
And man was lucky Unit's through
You know why he floss
15 years switching dealers like casinos
And my goon'll clip you in the arm
I'm out the country every week and dumping ash on the Autobahn
Autopilot's always on, rather better living, I've been hallway torn
Greenbills calling me all day long, this is homocide
More tears in your mama eyes
More reasons to wake up, real niggas arrive

[Chorus: Drake]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
