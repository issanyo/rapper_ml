[Lloyd Banks]
Uh, most hated I don't give a fuck
They gon' give me all mine back
My awards, my applause
Gotta rule world mind track
Ya'll are just weed, I'm crack
Everything that breathe gets high
Where my money bitch I'm back
Run up with the shit you die
Ghetto with a trip you buy
New fit, too fly
Hot day, blue sky
Lifes a bitch, cute eyes
Pitty anyone who tries
Really only one like him
Never been the boy too dive
No telling where that ho might been
Marijuana out my skin
White Benz, white rims
Well I go hella hard in the paint
Like Shaq, like Tim
Enemies fall we ride
Street ties, heat nine
Ain't no time to slip, got to stay awake
Sleep die, V5
V12, you eat a nigga dust
Bust a nigga put em' on a track
I go, nitro, psycho, when a nigga rap
Other niggas turned they back
Sold their soul to rap, not me
I'm still throwing up my G-U-N-I-T
I be, where the money go
International ID
P dot L dot K AKA Ali
Gave you niggas everything I had
My style, my swag
Never meant for them to fuck it up
They did, my bad
