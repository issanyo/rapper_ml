[Intro: DJ Drama]
America 2016
So much shit that changed
But yet, so much stayed the same
They been killing us recently like they've been killing us for centuries
Whatever you believe in whatever you stand for
Now more than ever
Its time to give all or nothing

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
South Jamaica baby they made me to be the greatest
Serving a deed to my creators
Fresh off of my high haters
Its the King again magnum went chauffeured
Bragging and boasting coaching niggas on curriculum
Carry two don't be a victim son
Picture me rolling, catch niggas dissing me scold them
Told them I would be someone worth envy and pity no one
Meet the gritty spokesman serving his fix, my city's broken
Only the serious survive scattered times to busy joking
Ready for homicide you hop in the ride, news rims keep poking
Niggas got every crime to offer outside, crew sends emotion
You can take everything away but my pride
Cool wins I'm coasting
40 below you try approach him
Conscious ears and eyes open
I'm thinking of ways to get paid green face devotion
Niggas went all the way to pop to get hot
Replacing most of them
Winning and poverty ain't going nowhere freebasing roaches
Look at the compliments accomplished this year
Briefcases open

[Hook]
We the only ones I see winning something I want it bad
I put my motherfucking soul in it gave it all that I had
Ain't no waving white flags
That shit will get you dragged
I pledge allegiance to the g code, honor and money bags
We don made it up in class
To the riches from the rags
Trust nobody that ain't family they'll switch up on you fast
Future bright cuz of my past
The opps will never last
Live it up together failures not an option in my path

I'm the reason you don seen something
Every view out the backseat
Front line in the diamonds heart poking out my black T
Never mind my track feat
Why the fuck you think that we, can be on the same frequency
Shit I don't even speak for free
My level can't be played with senses of the betrayment
I don't know how the hell you rocking
Hopping fences sending me shade
Milly rock on my enemies' grave
Should have got rid of you back in the womb
Niggas will drop their rep for sex the passion of the coon
I'm just a wisher never chose the fame
Redirecting my pain
Write up the contract and I smoke these lames
Right how do they choke or change
My vocal lanes 30,000 feet up in the purple rain
You prosper bet your circle change the idiotic grips your name
Manipulation to work the same work for yours
Kick them down they close the doors
These pricks belong on circus floors
Jakes still watching, searching walls
Vacant blocks and urgent calls
Niggas had the nerve to brawl
Shots pop opposition crawls

[Hook]
We the only ones I see winning something I want it bad
I put my motherfucking soul in it gave it all that I had
Ain't no waving white flags
That shit will get you dragged
I pledge allegiance to the g code, honor and money bags
We don made it up in classs
To the riches from the rags
Trust nobody that ain't family they'll switch up on you fast
Future bright cuz of my past
The opps will never last
Live it up together failures not an option in my path
