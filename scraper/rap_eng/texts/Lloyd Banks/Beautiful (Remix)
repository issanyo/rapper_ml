[Chorus: Pharrell + Lloyd Banks & 50 Cent]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Youse a hood rat
I just want you to know
You get no dough

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I wonder why I captured her sight, it had to been the ice
Brown skin, eyes weird like Russell Simmon's wife
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout bustin' in her twice
Brown color, corn bread, best customer in sight, aw-ight
Her body tight, too tough not to look
Louis Vutton shoes, gettin' cuffed bout to book
Smiled up the room, a Colgate grin
Spurs throwback hat with the oak grey timbs, big cup full of Hennessy
Nah that bitch ain't my girl, just whenever I'm around she pretend to be
Look, I don't dance much (no)
I'm in the club with the toast
If you're wondering why I'm pulling my pants up
My nympho lives on the edge and watches the WNBA
Wears braids and headbands, she cute plus her brain's sick
And she don't flip when I look at another chick
Cause she's lookin' at the same bitch

[Chorus: Pharrell + Lloyd Banks & 50 Cent]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Youse a hood rat
I just want you to know
You get no dough

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Pharrell]
See, I just want you
To know that you are really special
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
See, I just want you
To know that you are really special
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg, (Pharrell)]
Snoop Dogg Clothing, that's what I'm groomed in
You got my pictures on the wall in your room, and
Girls be complaining you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you in
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue and
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
On the Eastside, that's the crew I choose
Nothing I do is new to you
I smack up the world if they rude to you
'Cause baby girl, you're so beautiful

[Chorus: Pharrell + Lloyd Banks & 50 Cent]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)
Youse a hood rat
I just want you to know
You get no dough
