See Nothing move but the mula, A bomb
I want my time to share my views with the jeweler
Gem star, cut off your tubes, who wants scuba
Dive in these waters piranha will chew through ya
Mike J straight to the lamb, skip the scooter
Boogie Night days, hood on, my hand lifting buddah
Just a life phase, no one on this world you can all freeze
Beat it with your small keys, I leave them when I cross seas
Dollars say whatever I want, I got the right to
I hear the talk, but bet they money coming on a cycle
Smack a hater with my off hand, cold as an orphan
Kill me, you got to kill the niggas holding up my coffin
And I'm flossing, Ain't no trappin me while theres abortions
Get up off him, and realize that we just talking
And my truck Benz, Camera Park lens with the stock rims
Hit the pedal with my dark Tims, make the car spin
We ain't never had shit so everyday a holiday
Hold them like a big truck, chains like I got away
Fuck them all all night, but they don't get the time of day
Big old diamonds out the plate, kill 'em I'm behind the K
Talon in the dream, I'm as real as they come
Don't care where they from, None them niggas ill as the son
I'm peeling for fun, Rapping sour feeling in some
They dealing with crumbs, my cult followings in the slums
I ain't a breath of fresh air, I'm a hammer to the solar plexus
Holding up the city, damn I need a shoulder stretch
Brick full of gold already, working on the boulder next
They awesome with the talking, Bin Laden when it happening
I'm swagging, big body dragon through Manhattan
Yeah I'm independent but I'm living like I'm platinum
What happened? Your people fabricating through your rapping
And I money bag draggin' player hater grab aspirin
You slacking, here's a heat streak you've never seen
Hating adds fuel to the fire, fool you the kerosine
Needle to my body, I'm forever Queens
Ghetto nigga, truth filled boots and my leather clean
Head in green; your meddling
My cheddar scream loud as a rape victim
I'm picking off your petty team
My style a loaded magazine, infrareded beam
Lean just a little to the left, just to check my fresh
