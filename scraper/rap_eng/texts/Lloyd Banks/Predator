The sky is gray
Its like this everyday
The town is full of predators
Dont turn into the prey
I Flip a million out of nothing
Make them feel a certain way
Hoping that this swisher
Puts me in a purple haze
I got my eyes on the money
The only reason I'm gonna keep goin'
And I am back in the zone and its funny
Chronic bag the cologne
Another half and I'm gone
Hope the shit in my pome
Don't become me

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Horses like the derby, how I'm on my pace
Speakers booming, trunk knocking like a room of apes
I'm spinning donuts, give me too much space
Like the abducted, how I do my tapes
Get on the gate, I want it all like Deebo
Million dollar people
He gonn' cry when I get in the car
Vroom Vroom, see you at the top
I'm always clubbing
I don't see you alot
In rocks, golden onyx
Bumblebee with the watch
Son be talking reckless, cause son gon' be with the cops
I got the one and two slot, you'll be number three when I stop
I got the bitches in shock, They going full above it, pussy popping
B. Hopkins, Go bar for bar whatever hook he dropping
She jocking, she in the car with me, she take me shopping
She tricking, heir to the corner cuz the hood be watching
They boxed in, with no option above to rob the most
Balling like a motherfucker, living out my fathers hopes

[Verse 2: Styles P]
All the folks used to think I was a piece of shit
Used to be crack money, then I got my sneakers
With my eyes on the prize, don't you even try to peek at it
I ain't just holding this gun, nigga I sleep with it
Northside, Eastside, Westside, Southside
Gangsta niggas will vouch on how I put it down, Outside
Now its room service for dinner
And I ain't in the telly, I'm at home, I'm a winner
You ain't Bruce Lee, and I ain't the dragon that will end up in your home
In an Audi wagon holding on the chrome
My niggas lift weight like its barbells
All I know is entrepreneurs, models, and cartels
Athletes, Actors, My niggas that will break your back in half
And leave you a card for a chiropractor
Me and Banks got our eyes on the banks
You fucking with the sharks, cmon and dive in the tank
Waddup

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
I'm the best thing God made after he made beats
I don't sleep, I'm going over my Hall of Fame speech
First off, I wanna thanks my fans, and thank my haters
And thanks their girls for wanting to give the gangstas favors
A baby born soft, we beat the candy out him
Lil man land on his pops, now that's a family problem
The summers gone, I still be kicking where it's sunny
Let my tombstone read: Gone, getting to the money
Let the bird get the crumb, Don't trick a panty or then diss him
Henessy to the ground, hope my enemies don't get none
Shooter in all black, but he speaking with the mac
You run up on me sideways, you'll be planking on your back
Benzes from the benches, Benjy Franklins all for rap
Cold grimmy bitches, which junks the cause of clap
Out the country, thousand pictures, then took them New York and back
Lashing out the competition, the shook them right off the map
