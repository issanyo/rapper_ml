[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr.]
The Negro masses all over began to re-evaluate themselves
And the Negro came to feel that he was somebody...
His religion revealed to him that God loved all of his children!

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, I pray to him jealous cause he watching over them
I don't pretend, wishing they lose, hoping I win
Took my fitted cause I'm driving with no top
Hotter than a motherfucker riding with my Glock
Knock-knock, who is it? A hollow tip visit
You talk it if you live it, if not get delivered
Niggas hearts going frigid, there's no remorse
Nigga, I'd be the last one to give it hit your ass off you pivot
Then you pass on the syrup, and welcome the chronic
They wondering where the real rap well I'm helping them find it
Blinded, criminal minded in poverty binded
? just to be where I come from - rewind it your dumb son
Stuck on slow, sit they'll you to sleep
These motherfuckers know the walls is playing for keeps
The wounded lay on the street, the goons is playing for keeps
Be rude to say it at least, we wanna piece, nigga

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
You ain't gotta like me but you feel me
If you riding with that milli
Big voice, bigger city
You silly if you looking round for pitty
But we grimey and gritty
Big voice, bigger city
Stunting so these niggas want to kill me
Ain't a damn thing pretty
Big voice, bigger city
You ain't gotta like me but you hear me
Dead broke or big willie
Big voice, bigger city

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Money don't make it easy, money make it harder
Get smart you can get it, but it don't make you smarter
The music stop moving, I'm a make them love a car or
On contrary to whatever you heard I am harder
Lyrically revolver, metaphoric father
Heading for the dust so I'm an incredible rider
An a bit of ?, meet Britney and Tanya
No breakfast in bed just the Ganja
I kinda miss the days, when we honored honor
Loyalty cause karma can be a baby mama
I been a G since ? maybe longer
Ain't no pictures of me, I bring you the drama
Llama on your bottom dollar no pain no holler
Leave the scene no cops, no collar
I'm a beast, the sickest shit spitting on the East
How I know? Walk around listen to the street nigga

[Hook]
