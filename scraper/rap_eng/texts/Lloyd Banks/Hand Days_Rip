Uh!
Kh, k-hm! {DAMN! }
People! (people...) {Whooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid! }
Haha!
This is real shit... (real shit...)
Ugh!
Are you a real nigga or real bitch? (real bitch...)
Ugh! (haha!)
Feel this! {DAMN! }
You wonder why my days hard? (why?)
I spent my mornin' at the graveyard. (uh!) crawled into this world gone walk away scared
Tattoos on my past views
I was told cash rules (haha!) get yours that smooth
Mash through! (whoo!) - I wasn't talk I comin' at you
Bred from a Puerto Rican lady and a black dude
And that dude - is why I'm me (yeah!)
Responsible (haha!) for every smile I see. (yeah!) {AMMO! }
Hue told me since a child I'd be (yeah!)
More than a regular boy and tha boy was he. (yeah!)
Right as ever I'm smart! I'm clever! (uh!)
He's good! (uh!) I'm better! (uh!) I'm hood - forever! (forever!)
My treasure value beyond measure
I stand out ain't gotta be all extra. (extra!)
Bank$ - the one you look small next to
Just like webster, run I'll catch ya!
If I ain't have all the money I'd ask betchya!
F*ck it! - Listen let all the water out your bucket
Furs and Specs when I flex
My swag, and steps extremely complex. (yes)
And ya'll just pecs you can't be the don next
The weight of that torch feels like arm reps. (reps!)
And I done heard it all now I'm gone bomb next
And f*ck all you niggas and don't take it outta context. (context!) {Whoooo! }
You gotta love a nigga loyal
When shit f*cked up he there for you
Now it's time to turn the heat up till it boil
And all you - a G (haha!) from the Sac to the soil!
{DAMN! }
