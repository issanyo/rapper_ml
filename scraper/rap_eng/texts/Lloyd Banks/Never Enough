We gripped up, nigga
Ain't no slippin' over here
Nigga!
Never have I ever will, you ever see another
Cold hearted muthaf*cker watch me as I make them suffer
Now watch me as I make them supper - they bullets ain't stop me
They made me tougher! (tougher!) - Built harder than Rocky - I ain't no sucker! (uh!)
Sucker fake clowns up in my face now with fake smiles
They diss you when you ain't round, they "Pom-poms" and hate now
It's strong arms and shake downs, cause they ain't got no spine
They're out they mind! (mind!) - Why you think I don't f*ck with them? - They're blind!
I'm 20-20! - Get with that funny money
Don't get back to lucky charms - for you die over something fake f*cking dummy
Dum-dums for them bums I come from
Where everybody want some - and niggas that's weak - end up a son's son! (uh!)
And we don't run from - nothing but 9-1-1!
Ate the f*ck up outta wolves - or become one. (become one!)
I'm soured up and hammered down, I'm the mouhf*ckin' man of town
And I ain't swam with nobody - cause back then you swam you, you drowned! (YEAH!)
They got me on the camera now, everybody's my family, waow! (waow!)
A bunch of money sucking leaches out for hammy downs
My older molers candy now, I pop up and they stand around
I'm hydraulic system up - we always got a squary round
Married women fear me now! - I jeapordize they're married vows
I switch cars every day - so I'm never bad with miles. (miles!)
I got styles and skin thicker than crocadiles
I'll bounty off ya bitch ass 30 thou' in my pocket now
Big money, small money, all money
All the money in the world ain't enough - my more money!
Big money, small money, all money
All the money in the world ain't enough - my more money!
Dummy!
{F*CK YOU LIGHT! }
That's it...
