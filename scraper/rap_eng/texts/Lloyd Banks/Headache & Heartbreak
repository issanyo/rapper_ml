[Intro]
(Authentic)

[Verse 1]
Flow dumb as the last nigga that got at me
Shot up with bags of D
Fresh out of LIU, welcome to Halloween Havoc 3
Turning my mileage in, your last time you're seeing me back for free
Blood in my writing pen, hype again, striking methodically
Honestly, can't nobody see me
I'm in stealth form, champion
Kept the belt on, bodies for trampling, never felt for 'em
I don't got the time to hate, let alone put the words together
At-ing niggas and never get at 'em, this is purging weather
Stack up on your surgeon cheddar
You're rat and reptilian merged together
Folks know the fire, penned in disturbing letter
Giants stomping holes in these tracks, keeping the road crumbling
Opps don't got no choice but falling back, uneasy souls hovering
Here's the soundtrack for the riders, progress keeps the loads coming
Dollars won't divide us, we're back to the gold thugging
Flaunting armor through your airwaves, drown 'em in stereo
Wonder what took so long to spot 'em, these clowns took over years ago

[Hook]
Think somewhere down the line, I lost my mind
Product of heartbreak and the neighborhood never been the remorseful kind
Won't see no handouts, you were forced to grind
Maybe you're better off staying away, you all will pay, you cross the don
Make one mistake they knock you off your dome
I'm thinking, cutting and suffering, family hoping that you come back home
Mad man at work, don't go disrupt his zone
You on the wrong side of town for bitching, you belong where the suckers roam

[Verse 2]
This time of year it's hard to sleep, better bullets and trucks of red
Competition uncomfortable, this the month I play pumpkin head
Field kicking this shit for years, hop off on your disgruntled leg
Any contact from these punches fell, victims and knuckles bled
They tell you foul shit about me, don't deliver it
Me on the other hand woulda got into it for hearing it
Formed in the room of trauma, no silence for this experiment
Hands of a super doctor, high tolerance, I ain't feeling shit
Anticipate reviews of my resume in the hottest summers
Look at what they push now, blooded gimmicks and one hit wonders
Perform in an empty stu', fendi crew with the gun slid under
Lightening to your family room, disrespecting the son of thunder
Been here overcompen' nigga
So for stomping daily, snap a monster picture
Blue and black from New York City's hardest hitter
Problem baby, born guerrilla
Panic charms a killer
Chipped shoulder for soldiers that took me for granted, bombs delivered

[Hook]
Think somewhere down the line, I lost my mind
Product of heartbreak and the neighborhood never been the remorseful kind
Won't see no handouts, you were forced to grind
Maybe you're better off staying away, you all will pay, you cross the don
Make one mistake they knock you off your throne
I'm thinking, cutting and suffering, family hoping that you come back home
That man at work, don't go disrupt his own
You on the wrong side of town for bitching, you belong with a sucker's wrong
