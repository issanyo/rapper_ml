[Verse 1 - Lloyd Banks]
Still building my fortress, I bet the outcome is gorgeous
Roses, daisys, orchards, tryna shape this crazy office
Sex scandals in my office
Privileges like the President
Destined to be enormous
Negligence in my residence
Count it out with my life
Kick ball with the evidence
Horror when I first started
Sig-Sauer with it ever since
Back in it from the future
Quick draw of my era it's
Absolutely mine, big fog in your heavens bitch
Hate in my area, spray, chloro-bacteria away
Fly out, my aerial great
But it get scarier, wait
Master, compare me to none
Stand him here, he my son
Like Godzilla when I come, damage here when I’m done
Heart beating from the drum, hammers hear on you some
Huh, motherfucking bum, wouldn’t spare you a crumb
Crumbling castle, why would a peasant be a hassle
More like a line-backer at you, bleeding tackle

[Hook]
We get into it
That's all we do
We gon get some more, that's mandatory too
Life is better rich, so I’mma go for broke
Man this shit gon sell itself, I got the dope
All that big shit talking means nothing till you do it, do it
Out the way, watch me get to it, to it, to it, to it

[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks]
Ammo in the car still, diamonds out the window
Giant, make a regular car look like a limo
I’m hood, so everything ain't all good
Caught in the middle, I should
Hold down my city how could
You fuck around with me? Why would
You seek attention? I’m like a lion out the fence when
I’m faced with tension, the audience just adds suspension
Get to it blind fold, mom I been this wild yo?
Trouble’s run up on you with your eyes closed
Broken heart, minds froze, fridges full of Rozay
Parking up the B-M, S-U-V'n when the snow lay
Shorty like to role-play, well I’mma play the pimp
I got that super-fly high shit, money made the limp
Dollar bill give me chills
Fat ass fills and model hills
And it’s real, I’m going in for the kill
Eyes on another mill, known for ripping down shit
Young Shaquille, southside deal with Sugar Hill
