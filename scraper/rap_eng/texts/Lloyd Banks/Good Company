I'm walkin' round with a tool! - Chinchillas and gator feet (ugh!)
Leather seats, I don't fear nothin' bring on whatever beef. (whatever!)
I'm on a level you will never reach! (reach!)
Every 16, my leverage peaks - I go to bed with' heats!

And I only like green faces - I'm a racist, let's take it back to the basics!

Miss it! - My heart so cold you'll catch a draft! (yeah!)
Ask the opposition 'bout him, they doubt him, the crowds crowd him (uh-huh!)
And my mixtapes are magic, patched together like an album! (yeah!)
I've been labeled since a child and I'm black, I'm wild and I'm violent
Won't crack a smile and I'm silent - while the stacks keep piling. (piliing!)
And as the world keep spinnin' I keep stylin'
On a far deep island, from a concrete ground and - I'm DROWNIN'!
{DAMN! }
