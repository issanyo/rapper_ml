[Lloyd Banks]
Uh, right back on my way
And thats on everything
Can't shit stop this

[Verse1: Lloyd Banks]
Stressing makes the time stretch
Its going fast as shit, finesse any contest
The pressure made me progress
Confess her crazy complex
24 max, maybe a blonde next
I get outta line play me my projects
God gave me these side steps
Look how im juke'n haters scrapping up they begging hands uh'
Blood on the blueprint
Flooded the city with exclusives
Puddles to pool quick, gutta's no cool kid
He's hittin'
Doubt em you stupid niggas tryna stop me prove it, wondering where the comp but im the realest at it
Hella punches i get my stomps in
Put me against ya top 10
Im top rope jumpin' something about the way im killing shit
Gettin' money's my function
[?] blunts in, fuck everybody but kin, my niggas and my real fans
That keep me in discussion
Sneak it in nobody tussling
You running your trap, probably be nothing
Bring ya niggas down too, comedy sunk in

[Hook]
Live forever go for somethin'
The fuck is time i knew these niggas all my life and i still dont trust em
The thought of ruling got my blood rushin'
I calm my nerves counting the paper, and brick weed crushin'
Is it the money or the fame you want?
You after light or you want everything you love right
Cuz' winners never gave it up
Around here everyday was tough
We toughed it out ears to the street
And you runnin' ya fuckin mouth

[Verse 2: Lloyd banks]
Dollas in my eyes again
And envy icing me, king know who you copying
Im climbing these stairs with rocky wind never to be dropped again
Scraps outta versace bin
You hoped for change and married her
She about to go lobby sin
Profit when im straight stretched out at the top again
Missing dime calls, way to pimpin' to lock em in, you used to have what it took, i think you losing it unanimous as usual
Couldn't see me on my human shit
Watch how my movement click
Been taking my time no room to slip
You talking dumb shit
I switch time zones before the rumor hit
Yall acting slow now, i own the block and dead it
From where they dont play fair
Pull arms out like Olynyk
Move on, your cycles ended
You boring my life is spending
Strong highlights the limit
Wrong you might diminish
These songs ignite the menace
Warm goodnight to end this
Them reminisce with all ya friends thats part of the red list

[Hook]
Live forever go for somethin'
The fuck is time i knew these niggas all my life and i still dont trust em
The thought of ruling got my blood rushin'
I calm my nerves counting the paper, and brick weed crushin'
Is it the money or the fame you want?
You after light or you want everything you love right
Cuz' winners never gave it up
Around here everyday was tough
We toughed it out ears to the street
And you runnin' ya fuckin mouth
