*Lyrics to be added*
[Hook]
Jealously forever shown, so I’ve been on my own
Everyday a episode, another one world of disown
I’m gone!

[Verse]
No where on my radar I been out the mix baby
Work hard you can play more I’m exotic trip crazy
Gossip is hard to stick to me, that’s how the bricks raise me
Might let this 40 fly out as long as the clip 80
One of the greatest of all time, heard it from slim shady
Ya pens lazy, shine harder the ghetto lens hazy
Congratulations to dropping, pick up a Benz maybe
What you done don’t matter these days
Honor depends lately, watch what you comment on
Plenty things you can bleed bout
Gangstas got me spooked now
Walking around wit they knees out
Groupie niggas sleeping ya life away on that dream couch, Wonder winners into them every thing in between counts
All the jewels im dropping find a quarter you’ll be wealthy
So many niggas switchin' might wind up takin' a selfie
You can kick a million 16s never makin' an LP
I'm the only one alive that's nice
So who I'ma get to help me

[Hook]
Jealously forever shown, so I’ve been on my own, everyday a episode, another one world of disown
I’m gone
Finer views and better stones
They won’t leave a nigga alone
Around the world my second home
Ain’t nobody calling my phone I’m gone!
