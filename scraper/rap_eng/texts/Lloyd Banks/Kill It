[Intro]
Girl you’re something special
I just wan the chance to get to know you better
Wine you and caress you
Spoil and impress you
Put you in my front seat
Take you home and sex you

[Hook]
I used to day dream about the green, now I got it
Fast cars, credit card, Louie wallet
The girl I’m with now is hot but you hotter
One look at you and I almost forgot her
She gon wanna kill me, cause I wanna kill it
Shawty let me get it, I’ma spend a weekend in it
Get one impression, swear I gotta kill it
Hour after hour girl, you gon need a minute

[Verse 1]
I’m into steady stuntin in my Phantom ghost
Brand new Louie, brand new outfit
And my brand new toast
Rep by the love get my cake and eat it
I want both
Im only here for the summer than I’m leaving out the coast
If we get close I’mma have to book another seat
Baby something sweet
Body you would love to keep
Been fucked to sleep
We can stay up, drink all this Rose up
Smoke my weed and kick it
That sex gobbled a day up
For me this girls a lay up
She knows I don’t need it
Difference is I want someone I could see me with
Could be our little secret
Not cause I’m ashamed but for all the nosey hoes
Infatuated with fame
Pussy’s my addiction, your’s is like cocaine
Girl let me light your life up
Put you on the game
I have you riding Bentley, put you off the train
Strike a pose, take aim knock the picture out the frame

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ugh, I had a shorty, but after fucking you, it’s over
I’m all wet, momma sitting on a super soaker
Ruin the sofa, I bend her over, bruise her coacha
Hell of a looker, somebody should give you a poster
Shes my holster, careful how you fools approach her
See we’re tight now and everyday we’re moving closer
When I’m with you is when I’m calm, baby you the bomb
Fat ass, fly shit on, Christian Louboutin
Cruise along beaches, Canary Island features
Lambourghini, Porches, gorgeous chrome sneakers
The gossip won’t reach us
We in another World, keep doing that, I won’t think bout another girl
Bad bitches fuck, come now is all I’ve done
1 million reasons why I ain't belong with them
We live with no worries and spend money for fun
Dodge, no flurries, lear jetting to the sun ???

[Hook]

[Outro]
You got it baby
Almost forget her…
