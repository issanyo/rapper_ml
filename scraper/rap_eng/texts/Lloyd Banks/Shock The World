[Verse 1]
They ain't did it how I do it, niggas got the nerve
Major digits through this music, new shit I deserve
Push myself off of the ledge, I think I got the urge
Finer things when I’m climbing, diamonds and furs
I keep it rugged, they love it, I’m always out in public
Boy you used to, you suspect and ballin’ on a budget
You a leecher, who does that, don’t go around the subject
Hit the bleachers, you been wack and you ain’t get no luck yet
Now you dissing or I’m tripping, cause muthafucker listen
Offend me with what your spitting I’ll be gone to the system
Get the fuck from round me I don’t know you, its tradition
I’m low like there’s a bounty on me, police started tripping

[Hook]
I’m making ‘em sick, you all know the remedy
Money over all, wish wrong on my enemy
I’m getting dough so the girls go to bed with me
Shawty got the plug now she goin' off my energy
Thats right, goin' off my energy
I’ma shock the World bet they all gon’ remember me
She goin’ off my energy
Goin’ off my energy

[Verse 2]
Uh, rose still bubbling, ball in every club I’m in
Electric when I’m walking through, come here let me plug you in
Multitask hustlin’ I’m goin’ for the double win
You’re falling off and fumbling
Heading right for trouble, man, I’m pimpin’, I’m poppin’
My Lawyer good as Cochran
If you listen and watch him you realise I drop him
Weed copping, I’m shopping so we all the bitches jocking
Man, I’m minking and crocking, he nervous when I’m dropping
Man I’ve been under dog for too long, its easier to do wrong
Cautious when I get my groove on, thats how they move on
A nigga catch ya slipping, you’ll be booked
Showing off on the internet with what he took, another jooks

[Hook]
