[Sample]
The saddest word I've ever heard is almost causing me...
That whatever you tried you didn't make it

[Verse]
Yeah, I'm back hater the wait is over, ya hate it don't ya?
Bet ya rather see me on a stretcher
Nevertheless I breathe easy, let the Lord bless ya
I'll open ya nose, I'm raw pepper
Ignore pressure, heffa
So think about it cause I'm with it, get it, got it good
Now get the fuck outta here, I'm for the hood
You should be on ya P's and Q's, niggas'll squeeze the Uz'
In broad day on ya boule' they don't believe in rules
You hear about it on ya evening news
Believe me dog a nigga'll get ya if he need the shoes
These little rap fucks are merely my pups
I sits 'em down on they ass
To let 'em know who's the boss, they bow they heads when I pass
I'm in a class of my only homie, the real niggas feel me, hear me
I'm iced the fuck out with my Rollie on me
And Tony told me, in due time they would know me
And it only took a year for him to show me
I'm back for my spot

[Outro]
Yeah, it feels good man
Diamond in the rough, product of the hood
Live how I wanna not how I should, nigga
50, what up?
I told you these niggas, they ain't fucking with me, man
Second time coming, yeah!
Just getting started baby, ha, yeah!
