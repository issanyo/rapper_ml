[Intro: Young Buck]
Hello? Hello?
Anybody know what G-Unit at?
50, where the fuck you at, nigga? (uh)

[Chorus: Young Buck & (Lloyd Banks)]
Somebody called and said the rap game needs us
(They talkin) Fuck it, they talked about Jesus
(Still hatin) Yeah, they hated on Jesus
(The real waitin) They talked about Jesus
This one here is for all non-believers
(They talkin) Fuck it, they talked about Jesus
(Still hatin) Yeah, they hated on Jesus
(The real waitin) You know they talked about Jesus

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
(Yeah!) I could care less 'bout a rapper and his entourage
I don't give a fuck about a Phantom, it's not in our garage
Quick to take a project bitch to a Travelodge
Fuck her to some Mary J. Blige, get out of dodge
Dirty nigga, but all my dope clean though
And I got fishscale for sale, fuck you mean hoe?
You niggas crack under pressure, Tim Tebow
The shots didn't hit, you was at the free throw
I let my heat go, pull up with my seat low
Girls smoking, I keep asking Banks "where the weed go?"
Still with the shit, still searching for a kilo
I'm the reason why these niggas peeping out their peephole (Hello?)

[Chorus: Young Buck & (Lloyd Banks)]
Somebody called and said the rap game needs us
(They talkin) Fuck it, they talked about Jesus
(Still hatin) Yeah, they hated on Jesus
(The real waitin) They talked about Jesus
This one here is for all non-believers
(They talkin) Fuck it, they talked about Jesus
(Still hatin) Yeah, they hated on Jesus
(The real waitin) You know they talked about Jesus

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, wouldn't dent a armor at them niggas all together (nah)
Louie summer sweater, Yankee on the sky-dweller
'gamo belt, fly fella, they think all of mines vanilla
Six or seven more flavors out in Vegas with weather
Light my kush up in the hall of fame (uh)
Cavemen, break out your ball and chain, I'll orchestrate the walk of shame
Your life's plain, escort me through here like the president
Royal room, you gotta tell the hoes what hotel I'm in
You never been, you out here regular, ain't got one Heckler
I ball consecutive, as long as they got neck to give
Salute you ever see me, I'm a vet
CD full of crack, easy with the grills, click clack

[Chorus: Young Buck & (Lloyd Banks)]
Somebody called and said the rap game needs us
(They talkin) Fuck it, they talked about Jesus
(Still hatin) Yeah, they hated on Jesus
(The real waitin) They talked about Jesus
This one here is for all non-believers
(They talkin) Fuck it, they talked about Jesus
(Still hatin) Yeah, they hated on Jesus
(The real waitin) You know they talked about Jesus

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
Yeah, fishscale paid the bill, I ain't never been broke
Arm ya, Adrien Broner on the ropes
I'm still at that Mickey D's off of Atlantic
My BK niggas, man, I feed 'em hammers
My connect only speaks Spanish
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, four bricks then vanish
Jump in the Martin Vanquish
Donald Sterling think he a slave master
Turn my Clippers jersey inside out
Feed niggas with long spoons running their mouth
Godfathers to the head, baseball bat, Mike Trout your legs
Overseas pussies, y'all loving thots
Been around the world, crime scene in a parking lot

[Chorus: Young Buck & (Lloyd Banks)]
Somebody called us and said the rap game needs us
(They talking) Fuck it, they talked about Jesus
(Still hating) Yeah, they hated on Jesus
(The real waiting) They talked about Jesus
This one here is for all non-believers
(They talking) Fuck it, they talked about Jesus
(Still hating) Yeah, they hated on Jesus
(The real waiting) You know they talked about Jesus
