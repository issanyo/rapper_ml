[Chorus]
Don't ever doubt my hunger
You'll never know the difference whether upper or my last number
I love to make you wonder
If you don't bring shit to the table we're done, the bums'll take you under
We come from nothing, they taught us from the playground
You fall, you don't stay down
The watchers got an appetite for winners, they after us all day now
Your trust is in the tre' pound

[Verse 1]
If you ain't dyin', it ain't urgent
I figured out your type for certain, the attention seeking type of person
A righteous man alike the verses
A fake is practicing now, sit in traps as he rehearses
Being loud where you low at defeats the purpose
A little wisdom, you can take it or leave it to each's hearses
Like the villain meets the circus, a masterpiece for purchase
Violate us you'll have room to relax beneath the surface
Knowing that bullshit gon' come back, timing your visits
Barely do the speed limit, young black, mindin' ya business
Think I'm being watched over or something, align my spirits
Know the Devil sent his demons as scouts, sometimes I hear it
Bet the trouble's just waiting, still play it cool
For the kids that might be listening to me, just stay in school
No compassion, cry a river to splash in, won't change the rules
Impossible to out run the reaper, your name is due

[Chorus]
Don't ever doubt my hunger
You'll never know the difference whether upper or my last number
I love to make you wonder
If you don't bring shit to the table we're done, the bums'll take you under
We come from nothing, they taught us from the playground
You fall, you don't stay down
The watchers got an appetite for winners that after us all day now
Your trust is in the tre' pound

[Verse 2]
Leaches take your kindness for weakness, deceit from no one
Get your money, live your life for your family should be your slogan
Holy year to get my mind clear, figured you'll leave a omen
Will'll bring me the Unthinkable, never believe it's broken
If I get out the bottom, I'll pull you up
To my people don't be worryin' 'bout me, my fully tucked
If it's your time there's no avoidin' it, anyone can get touched
If you gon' risk it make it count, why petty crime 'n in cuffs
Hope for beautiful dreams, popped up enemies and funeral screams
Hollows and odor make the musical clean
Murdered the booth at 15
Bloodied up audience, the usual scene
Logos for ornaments, amusement for kings
Don't got the temper to spare niggas you improvisin'
Easier to press hair triggers at niggas noggin'
Being online is a fee, you let the bitches log in
And they done left you on E, don't know who did the robbin'

[Chorus]
Don't ever doubt my hunger
You'll never know the difference whether upper or my last number
I love to make you wonder
If you don't bring shit to the table we're done, the bums'll take you under
We come from nothing, they taught us from the playground
You fall, you don't stay down
The watchers got an appetite for winners, they after us all day now
Your trust is in the tre' pound
