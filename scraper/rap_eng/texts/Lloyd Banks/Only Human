[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I stay where they all grimy, it's right by me
I will never ever put my armour down (no), they might try me
Man my niggas ain't catching breaks (nah), they catching bodies
Got a thing for setting shit straight, just out a hobby
I be on my 1 and 2's son, I don't who you got your news from, fucking with me, you goin' lose one
Dogs delusional, I'm not your usual, I am a cash cow, I'll turn you to a walking funeral
Now that's beautiful, can you picture that, that's a heavy load, ain't to many niggas lifting that (nah)
Those that switch sides, and shifting back, this is diffrent rap, THCï»¿ flow, with a fifth of yack
My crew packed, they ask me who to shoot
I tell 'em, any motherfucker too close to the coupe
Man I'm hot as Beirut, you colder than Alaska
All I do is pop through your HD plasma

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
I hear alot of threats, a whole lot of talking
But, the talk don't apply to me
Cause' they know, that I know
That everything alive can bleed
Ride with me
Mamma ain't raised no fool and
Mamma's man ain't raise no punk (Don't get slimed) (Don't get slimed)
Out here, don't nothing come free, gotta take everything you want

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Respect don't come easy, you got to earn it, learn it
Don't nobody get it breathin' that don't deserve it
It ain't always how you speak your mind, it's how you word it
Depending on who your speaking to, and how he heard it
Watch your base [? ] around the bread winner, it will get you murdered
Witnesses won't appear in court, an easy verdict
Niggas, snitches come in all colours and all ages
Old, young, red, black and caucasian
I'm blazin, certified funk off the skunk tree
Fifty G front me, I'll fly out the country
Rap cops want me, cause' my pockets all chunky
My belt's 500, and Jean's are Red Monkey
If I apply the pressure, you'll fall like a bean bag
I see like a catcher, and hold up a green rag
I pray to God, cause I know he looking over me
My family don't gotta need, that's how it suppose to be
High off purple trees, the henny make me Hercules
Penny's make dollars and dollars make it work for me
I'm meaner and I'm rock 'n' hoein', I'm clean and my pockets swollen
I'm leaning in somethin' foreign, supenas cannot control it
I gets it going, I'm certified, boneified, fuck boys fall back before it be homicide
I live my days like my last, cause I almost died, on the streets of south side

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
I hear alot of threats, a whole lot of talking
But, the talk don't apply to me
Cause' they know, that I know
That everything alive can bleed
Ride with me
Mamma ain't raised no fool
Mamma's man ain't raise no punk (Don't get slimed) (Don't get slimed)
Out here, don't nothing come free, gotta take everything you want
