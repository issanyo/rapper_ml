[Verse 1]
You gotta king a motherfucka
Royalty while my tomb awaits
Ghetto superhero spankin street sweeper broom and cape
So hope my fate dont lie on my mistakes
Compliment the misfortune, there ain't no such thing as a drama place
No bitch ass niggas at my wake, i wake up
Chase niggas up outta there bottom tier in my bake cup
Hooptie money comin in Hidin there in a freight truck
Punch niggas asleep still vladimir on the wake up
Endangered lyricist safer you take the rock route
Look how my wheels pop out, extravagance
Suspensions like a drop out
To battle poverty's humiliation pity wasted on potenital loss doubt and complacence
Rappers blood all on my apron, and splattered pride across
We gon celebrate with champagne burps and chronic coughs
Bet ya homies got a price and show they colours you should ask him sucker punches perfect timing like a government distraction

[Hook]
They say the goals impossible ima try
Ive been grinding too long and it's time to fly
Life without the opportunities,like he dies inside
Ima wind up taking it with me, never give up my fucking pride
Gotta watch out for the creep
Any night can be your last night, you can't afford to sleep
Otherwise they'll have you deep
I will not be like the last one insomniac we keep

[Verse 2]
Diamond flurries ice the tints
Counting my bad luck
Not a worry legends don't bleed they close back up
Ready tuck for you to see it
I got the armor boosters
My little nigga'll knock your block off body armor is useless
New outfit to shop, Ferrari cop,  to do list
Bring out a room for new friends, say goodbye to opportunists
Money ties without restraint, paper promiscuous
Hollows have you rollin' on the floor, make you look ticklish
Sleeping beauty woke for my charm, gave her my dick to kiss
Blue on purp ridiclious, clouding what your depiction is
Ya'll alive in 17 probably open in the broke awards, no applause
24 swords go in my vocal chords
Turn a super model spy stalker
Designer fly talker, rollin' a set, be a sky walker
Patient, nostril, ear and eye torture, south jamaicas don torture, mind your business duck the crime chalker


[Hook]
They say the goals impossible ima try
Ive been grinding to long in this ima [?]
Life without the opportunities,like he dies inside
Ima wind up taking it with me, never give up my fucking pride
Gotta watch out for the creep
Any night can be your last night, you can't afford to sleep
Otherwise they'll have you deep
I will not be like the last one insomniac we [?]

[Verse 3]
Wonder where my grindin went to
Punish niggas all summer, then
Picture me stumblin, your favourite rappers mumbiling
Jungle when in the 600, triple six roller
Full of mcying in the 3 bruce leafs my wrist colder
Loaders screaming as i whip around
Genius dumbin my shit down
Demons comin in chicks hound
They rather see you split crown
They want us in the blood shed bed drops in the ghettos pain
The man target terrorist pop calling the kettle names
The power in me is higher, give a fuck who understand you though
They ain't gonna give a nigga another they can't handle Run through millions like a 100 grand club, runners the summer jam
Am i my brothers creeper, like nino and duh duh man
Tragic to handle of a manic left for bastard
Video clips on club strips, tear drops in the casket
You gotta ride as hard interfere in hops and grabs it
Born a star, watch out for peers blockin the magic

[Hook]
They say the goals impossible ima try
Ive been grinding too long and it's time to fly
Life without the opportunities,like he dies inside
Ima wind up taking it with me, never give up my fucking pride
Gotta watch out for the creep
Any night can be your last night, you can't afford to sleep
Otherwise they'll have you deep
I will not be like the last one insomniac we keep
