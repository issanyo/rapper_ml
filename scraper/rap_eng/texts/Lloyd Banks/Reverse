[Verse 1]
They smilin' in your face
All the time wanting to take your place
Them backstabbers destined for mac splatters and satan shakes
Lost in the discipline that patience takes, they rather take yours
Repetitive stories of loyal dons attacked by they dawgs
This comes for times for circulation
Right hand smack niggas counter clockwise, reverse the hatin'
Intuition mixed in with my montage grimey debating
Up and personal, won't be no drive bys, fly goons that chase 'em
Big money will flip shit upside down, top form just pacin'
Your behaviour only bring crowds crying, you're due vacation
Shit talking never gets old, and you wanna race us
In a town of keen memory works against negotiations
Facial features on a fresh tee you test me
I get over it with weed and jet ski, make my respect be..
Motherfuckin' priority, hidin' duckin' you oughta be
Get you clipped for a quarter ki
Disrespect's an enormous fee

[Hook]
You decide to chill it gets real, hit you right where it hurts
Gotta be on point in the warfare can't put shit in reverse

[Verse 2]
Ever think about the place you gon end up in when you die
You coming back, or just peaceful eternal sentence to the sky
When you pay for all the crosses black smoke burning your eyes
Mindful of horrible memories enemies waving high
They want your people giving off weird energy major sign
Never appearances snuck right up on you figure the fame was fine
Being thirsty will have you leaking think chillings a waste of time
You discuss shame in the mirror predictable face of grime
Figure you get a little slack cause your spirtual case declined
You fucked up, ready for chemicals wishing you can change your mind
Niggas beefing giving away the location and you just followed em
They scheming and you helping 'em, where's your sense of survival been ?
Garage full of foreigns you'll never drive again
Youve been mourned a couple of mornings but they ain't losing no oxygen
Crying children and memorabilia for boxes, when your gone life just goes on rest and peace and so on

[Hook]
You decide to chill it gets real, hit you where it hurts
Gotta be on point in the warfare can't put shit in reverse
