[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo, what up, what's good?
Yeah, nigga, hold this money right here, yeah
We already got them mapped out, you know
Alright, don't even stress it
Niggas got mad coke inside the Luvs pampy
Luvs Pampers box, nigga
Them niggas is stupid

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
That nigga pussy doing pig latin, he can't come to the hood
Might kill him off top up in the Staten
Son think he better than niggas, I think his rebels is resentful
Tried to kill him in his rental
He had an Idi Amin approach, hitting the roach
Had a hunger face, he drove his moms Seven in the ocean
It's a wild cowboy sling heroin, who rock the dead arm
Knocked the DEA agent out his Cheron
All his Eli's, macheted up, stainless --
You never heard nothing, all you hear is the guns blaze
Rocking pastel blazers, with a shorty from Iceland
Who old dad put him up on rice and
Starving to make a wack debut, he came through the lobby
Three coacher Devilles with him, a whitey, it's pathetic
Ragged monkey face, faggot dead it
Coming through the stairs with blow in his mouth, desperate
Watching him looking stupid, son know we on foot patrol
Come through the hole, niggas is spooking
Seven hundred shots, all leather gloves, six thugs
Two had a mask on, he took 'em off what
We got you now, nigga, blowing you down, niggas is foul
This is trauma king, by any means, blaow
They pushed his face in, fell out his Saucony's, snatched his homeys
Took his Glock, you gon' be my tenderoni?

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uh!
Metal exchanges, the hood's the gun range
Everybody's a target depending on how you aim
Dice games and ice chains, pendant spelling your name
OG's setting the wrong example, tellin' the same
Look at Shorty Shitstain, grew up to be a fucking mess
Before his clique came, he bang and never tucked his chest
Closet full of them thangs, he caught the gun connect
Riding 'round with ''A'' and ''Lil' Nino'' and they want respect
Son cool, Nino want the show
Everybody know they straight shippin' hood bitches to the bungalow
Pillow talkin' let the birds hawk it
Chattin' bout what happened, and when and what they coming back in
Champagne slackin', traffickin' while they travel
Word got back the old time friends and snakes rattled
Two different 'burbans, but the one that dropped the birds got tailed.. Information for the ones that like to steal, got mailed
Pussy power made the plans sour
Apartment full of party powder, outside a stakeout for hours
Click clacks from big gats and rags
Soon as the door squeaks they runnin' up on the grass
Bang, flash! Shots ride on path of broken glass
Comedy laughs, while they haul ass with the bags
Legends in my hood played back, twin Benzes whippin' in black
And that was like the old Maybach
