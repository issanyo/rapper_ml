[Verse 1]
Middle fingers raising, here's to changing
Niggas real on occasion drag your name through the dirt
And send you arrangements
I'm in awe cause they shit is store drugs
And it's one hundred pills a cycle, maniac off four plugs
What don't kill you going to make you strong
No more taking back, no more slugs
Nigga will watch you grow up from diapers
This shit ain't all love
Still ain't a limit on clubs
Uglier days ahead, second coming of greatness
Dead - this shit feel like the first time
The flow that painted the basement red
Got these bitches banging like they active
Rules mingling backwards
Silk sheets, marriage, hanging over the mattress
I've been jumping borders, kicking this game
Shoebox stacked to ceilings
Bunch of quarters, pissing champagne
Blu popped a half million
Niggas talkin' shit with no name
Choose not to pass the feeling
Easy if I should clash with y'all
My freestyles make ya album small
Switch up every fucking day
New shit'll be out tomorrow
You should've new better
Exclusive nigga out for all

[Hook]
Living for the moment, don't get caught up in the light
Fuck they hype, wrong or right cause there ain't no chance tonight
Don't mind me, I'm on my flight
Thirty thousand up with the gold still on my sight
Niggas rather you buried, you know the type
Got to hope no better
Fuck all you niggas, and it's M.O.B forever
Ever have a hard time and you relate?
Dollar signs calling my mind until I'm straight

[Verse 2]
The point of no returning in rap, I'm close to that
A box of ammo in a dark room
Waiting, been holding back, woods burning
I curve the best of them
Right after the sex with them, they call
Mail a message when I'm entering the section
Next to me and no one, won't remove the iconic author
Dial like cable before they drop quick, groupies for body armor
Tour the world like Rihanna, leather pea coat
Trying to get into anything that's designer
If it's the east coast 'bama
I had a vision of precision, my decision is to be
More than they wrote me out, the phonies out to humiliate thee
Most underrated ever, hella shit free
There ain't a hater breathing never diss me
It won't matter, all through November
Get green style by window
My ambulance for instrumental
My darkest intro, could it all be so simple?
Single me out at the party
No confidence, two times defeat
I'm like Ghandi, love all the hate
I get to see you won't scar me

[Hook]
