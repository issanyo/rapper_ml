[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Back to edit the argument
Classic reminiscent new drive
Credit the talkers with, smash ya television crew lies
Add up the awkward shit
Maybe your the new me, who lied?
Fuck is my orchestra? Somebody pulling strings
New rings bring in the formula
Dont be the one that wish they prepared after the storm occur
Paris, London, China and more back to the corner store
Ain't really no boarders out here
Feels like corridor, the weak prey'd on
Extortion law, back n forth's still with my old mentality battling
Come up with something thats gone live long
Carry me staggering
New niggas gettin' outta line now
Battery added when shit hits the fan
That made me more stan
Never been accurate
Right a traffic in a dead jam sped on the average
Im half showman half savage
Head of the palace
Trader tricked then in my head club
Better the challenge
Lotta confusion brings a lil' balance

[Hook]
Ain't no guarantees you never know
Betta be ready, do it all now or get tore down, part of the show
You gotta stranger dedicated
Hoping to see ya drop
No different from ya last foe
They want your glow
All we know is the bottom minding my own, Probably off time zones
Imma get to whats waiting and bring home
Ain't settling either we out for more
Strapped how bout' yall
Problem solvers on call

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Colder the ghetto taught me get
[?] ground chip shoulder grimey new yorker shit
City outta order, exotic odor I brought
The zips, they give you money followed by problems that reinforce the fix
Torture shit, you want me forced commit
Feel like i stayed too long
Patience gone, borrowed lines still
Some in your favorite songs
Dream it, want it, you can go it
Long as your faith is strong
MC's dont want shit with me
Dont think my replacement spawned
[?] to chase the don
I had the style you took before the stats
Just can't go order that
Remember how you felt the first time round', Done brought it back
Dont wind up missing for the in crowd
Can you afford the crack
You'll snub a couple under 10 thou' now
No flaws in that
That pressure got you holding dear  life
Find out what tier you in
Dont go compare it when you ain't did shit but kneel again
Its scarier, endangered craft gone fast
You feel me then
Celebrating where we really been, uh

[Hook]
Ain't no guarantees you never know
Betta be ready, do it all now or get tore down, part of the show
You gotta stranger dedicated
Hoping to see ya drop
No different from ya last foe
They want your glow
All we know is the bottom minding my own, Probably off time zones
Imma get to whats waiting and bring home
Ain't settling either we out for more
Strapped how bout' yall
