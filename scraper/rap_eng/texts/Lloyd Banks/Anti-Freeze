[Verse 1: Maino]
Maino hustle hard, better pray to god
I swear to god, Lames better play they part
It's going down, I run this town
I’m here now, let’s get it!
Black flag, Black tee, shooters in a black truck
Diamonds on, getting money, haters on my right nut
Left arm automa bezzle look like falling stars
Fifty shot Calico, niggas better call on God
I'm the one they fear reason why they're running scared
Do it Mob style, bullet right behind his head
I declare I'm the king of Kings County
Stand up nigga why these haters can’t down me
Look around I round the town these other niggas clowns see
Go ahead let him talk slick I bet I make his mouth bleed
Homie we strong, these rap niggas peeons
They cuddle with the same bitches I pee on
Brick getters getting bread in rainy weather
My white girl savetta and it go panamera
I’m a don bitch miss me with that nonsense
.44 holster underneath my armpit
Fuck nigga the reason to love niggas
My last homie snaked me that's why I don't trust niggas
Straight to the devil is where I took them
Fuck what you heard I run Brooklyn

[Hook]
Cooler then antifreeze dammit these rappers be
The baddest thing happening since King had a dream
Cooler then antifreeze dammit these rappers be
The baddest thing happening since King had a dream

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Can;t stop too much cream veiw me on your movie screen
Got the sweater, got the hat, sneaker, and the Gucci jeans
Sicker than I used to be, time to get them used to Queens
Flawless bitches usually turn them all into super fiens
Mamy i’m the coolest from PYT's to cougars
The haters remorse they can D-I-E from rugers
Nigga say hello to Judahs, genius how I do this
Cleanest pictures standing out of Beemers with the blue wrist
Shorty keep my name low till my name, tell honey my angle
I'm touring and she taking off her leggings on the table
Pussy popping on the Skyp, crustin' on the phone
I’ma fuck her with my freestyle going off the dome
I got her smoking weed now, she’s glowing off patron
Kush cologne, weirdo when I push my poem, cripple chrome
In my Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island, Bronx, and Brooklyn zone
And I'm Nina packing, paper staking, bitch go get your own!
