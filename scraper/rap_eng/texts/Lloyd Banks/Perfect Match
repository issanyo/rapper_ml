[Intro:]
Who took to head that all hotties are hot?
I know, I know. I love this song...

[Lloyd Banks - Verse 1:]
Baby, the way my lust be goin'
You probably the right size
Big thighs, sick enough you make my blood pressure rise
With a body like that, you got the love exercise
When he couldn't over look you with a bomb in his eye
It might come surprise but don't confuse me with guys
I'm not here to provide, a few soon to be byes
I got a couple of ungrateful soon to be wives
I tell them a lot of things but they are usually lies
That is when I gotta talk to her all smooth when she usually cries
Cause she crazy I gotta keep her free from tools and the knives
I know it's open home but their nose open wide
Mad cause of enure theyself of those I describe
Complaining to their girlfriend, throwing the TV guide
But I'm not obligated, dedicate to surprise
I smoke more than average so you might see me high
I ain't never had shit, I got the right to be fly

[Hook:]
Let's go ridin' with the top down
Ladies feeling special
Maybe because I'm hot now (he hot now)
I can tell, when you actin' when you come through
A lil' when you're dancing makes everybody want you
Girl, you should be a model on a runway
My mama always warned me
I'd run into you one day (One day)
Before you leave home
Almost forgot to mention
You got my attention
We maybe we're a perfect match (I'm the first person to ya'll)

[Fabulous - Verse 2:]
So I can't stress any interest and anything less than a princess
Most cats, I guess they be impressed to chase any bird
That come out the mess in a thin dress
I saw that when you tall
Ain't no effort in blonde pretty heifers
And I got playmates now, porn in the Hefner pen
Fuck all night, and in the morning bring the breakfast in
Next time they see me, goin' grab a clef and then
Can't forget the foreigners of the heifalins
That clean thrill, with slick mouths, like floors of the Jefferson's
My girls are disciplined and trained to say thank you
I'm not the type to put a ball and chain on their ankle
After me, she know she got a brain that lay banks to
Cause they are no fun if homie can't have none
I'm fucking your girl so I don't need to have one
But if you wanna have one We can be your perfect match

[Hook:]
Let's go ridin' with the top down
Ladies feeling special
Maybe because I'm hot now (He hot now)
I can tell, when you actin' when you come through
A lil' when you're dancing makes everybody want you
Girl, you should be a model on a runway
My mama always warned me
I'd run into you one day (One day)
Before you leave home
I almost forgot to mention
You got my attention
We maybe we're a perfect match

[Lloyd Banks - Verse 3:]
You can get a writers apple out the batch
Look good in your grill, throwback and fitted hat
My OG got a kid, not a fact a few of em
I drop in, play a lil' play station 2 with them
Then I'm back to my mission cause I ain't movin' in
They seen a couple niggas before me
It ain't nothing new to them
I even got a hustler, she does the weed thing
With the hip pants low enough to see the G string
To sum it up, she a professional in the ring
Head thing, sick enough to make a grown man sing
Only problem that she gangsta and she like to swing
I gotta sit her down quickly, throw in a lil' 50
My nigga, down them hoes dollar chain
Them gold teeth, don't catch attention with that ass whip
I been around the world on my search
But now I'm ready to start from scratch
Cause we could get the perfect match

[Hook:]
Let's go ridin' with the top down

[Outro:]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh Yeah! (Yeah!), Yeah! (Yeah!)
This song... This song...
Who Kidd. What! What! What! What!
