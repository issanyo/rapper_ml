[Hook]
I'ma need a double, bring it on the double
A bottle each hand, I'm the fucking man
Cars double, broads double
And I don't have a girl, so I can't get in trouble
See I can do what, I can do whatever I want
Drink 'til I'm drunk and smoke my blunt
My baby outside you should hear my trunk
They gon' think about this stunt all month

[Verse 1]
Don't nobody see y'all because we are the best
The mighty mighty Unit, blue fitted, blue vest
Watch me get 'em, who's next? Who wanna be the one?
I'm shining royal diamonds in the nightclub with my gun
Back to the money twenty four hours committed
And I'm strapped like The Mummy, you a dummy you can get it
You ain't getting nothing from me, better get it how you live it
All my days is sunny, I stay out where you visit
Rich nigga I ain't had to think all day
Cash made, Ros√©, in my mink all day
I own VIP, have a drink on me
Girl we run this city that's how shit gon' be

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Shorty say I talk a lot of shit
I told her "Fuck talking, I can back it up quick"
She seen as I'm sitting in two hundred thousand whip
And I ain't never seen a vagina I couldn't hit
I roll up like a Marley in my brand new Klum Kardi's
Lamborghini, Ferrari, when I pull up at the party
She ain't usually snotty, now she showing off her body
Flaunting them while she walking and claim that's she's riding shotty
Moet, Henny, Bacardi, have ya chasin' everybody
Outside million four-wheeled Ducati
G's, check! Bentley! Jet!
Sour on deck! Frizzy! Neck baby!!!
