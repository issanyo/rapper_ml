[50 Cent]
Yeah, this somethin special y'know, somethin epic
Lloyd Banks, you know
Cause a nigga thuggin don't mean he don't
Don't wanna see you smile baby
[Intro: 50 Cent]
Wooo! he wanna be the reason you smile
He wanna be the reason you smi-ile
He wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
I'm gettin the feelin you wanna take revenge
From the conversations we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
That's why it's just me in my Mercedes Benz
It all depends, maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and relax in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts in tact
So everytime we seperate, somebody's marchin back
You're amazing in the sack
Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're black
God Bless whoever gave you all that
If you seen her from the back
You'd understand why this feel like that
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I ain't gotta say nothin, she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes
Up and down

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks] + (50 Cent)
Even though I'm not around, and you feelin down
Let the thought of me be ( be the reason you smile)
I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be ( be the reason you smile)
Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be ( the reason you smile)
We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be ( be the reason you smile)

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
The main reason I been lookin at you pitiful
What about the half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and took tip toed into a crib or two
I've come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky, cause I see niggas
When you tease 'em with your physical
She wanna rack up her brooms, I ain't got no more room left
Wild drama, section 8 princess
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed
Plus it's hard to communicate
Cause she don't speak-a no english
I been around the world state to state
But now I'm back bustin in your bathroom
Got you laughin in your shower cap, let's get it on
Cause I'm leavin in a hour flat but it don't matter she's mad
Even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And, I bet you I can make you smile

[Chorus] - 2X
