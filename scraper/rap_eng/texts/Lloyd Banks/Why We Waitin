[Intro]
There's somethin' special 'bout you, girl
'Cause you been on my mind all day
I ain't leavin' here without you, girl
So hurry up and say yes, and we'll be on our way

[Verse 1]
When I ride through the city
You're undeniable shape got my eyes on ya titties
I'm checkin' out ya tattoos, you got me breakin' the rules
You're just enough to make me confused
There's money spent on ya from ya head to ya shoes
And that ass'll put a smile on Scrooge, haha
I got broads that'll come here on the move
But to be honest, if you were mine we'd be somewhere on a cruise
I'm usually with the tools
'Cause niggas be hatin', you know how it is
Niggas waitin' to make ya move, shit
You from the projects, you know how it is
Know how hard it is to find you a wiz with a job and no kids
Girl, I work hard for these cribs
Every car in the garage, every jar in the fridge
Lend me ya hand to help you understand why I am what I am
But first turn around, goddamn (goddamn)

[Chorus]
From a conversation
I can feel ya pulse and ya heartbeat racin'
I'm tired of bein' patient
And if you feel the same way, tell me why are we waitin'?
There's somethin' special 'bout you, girl
'Cause you been on my mind all day
I ain't leavin' here without you, girl
So hurry up and say yes, and we'll be on our way

[Verse 2]
Lampin' in that GT Bent
And it be hard for you to forget the weeks we spent
Them episodes in the kitchen, breakin' the dishes
Sweatin', switchin' positions, head on head collisions
Them broken headboards, the sheets thrown on the floor
'Cause every time I stop, you keep yellin' for more
I'm stuck on ya figure
Try not to dig ya nails in me so hard
'Cause you keep puttin' cuts on a nigga
I'm hardly in the club, I party at home
A little haze and Bacardi limon to get you out of ya zone
But if you stay here we probably gon' bone
But the option is yours, black Barbie you grown
'Cause ya pants so tight, and ya shirt's so small
And even when I'm sittin' I'm still standin' tall
You're always at the mall, swipin' a card
You're damn near naked, that's why it stand so hard, uh

[Chorus]
From a conversation
I can feel ya pulse and ya heartbeat racin'
I'm tired of bein' patient
And if you feel the same way, tell me why are we waitin'?
There's somethin' special 'bout you, girl
'Cause you been on my mind all day
I ain't leavin' here without you, girl
So hurry up and say yes, and we'll be on our way
