[Intro: Announcer talks]
Mind stares of a million pairs of eyes...
Lookin' hard but won't realize, that they will never see!
The...

[Verse]
B-... A-... N-K-$!
S-K in the back of the truck. - Nigga what?
I'm remarkable! - Roll through the hood with' an arsenal
Lookin' for a bitch to put the sausage to
You niggas fallin' off! - I'm startin to feel like I'm responsible
Uuuuuuh! - The reason they won't respond to me!
Is all my niggas jump the gun?
You sneeze and they stompin' you
Back neck, knees and ya arms is too!
Ya album was a bad brick
Homeboy - I been hot since Freddy Krueger's last hit!
I'm incredible! - The one thing I won't ever do
Is slip up! - And tell you that these bitch niggas ahead of you
Real niggas, we don't want game tight
Bag a new bitch and fuck her the same night
I could take care of these niggas on my own
Patiently waitin for Yayo to come home!
Get the fuck out my way, I'm in the zone!
Muthafucka fist fight I hold the chrome

[Chorus:]
Bitch, SouthSide 'til the day I die
So you muthafuckas know where I'm from!
Niggas are jealous of the things I buy
So I gotta move around with my gun
If you don't smoke the kinda weed I smoke
Don't bring ya bullshit around me
I'm the number one nigga comin' out this year
So be satisfied with' 2 or 3

[Outro:]
Yeah!
Ya heard right nigga?
Can't none o' y'all niggs fuck with' the kid!
I don't give a fuck!
You get mad?
Feel bad?
Call my name pussy!
I ain't goin NOWHERE!
G-UUUNIT!
