[Verse 1 :LLoyd Banks]

Spendin' This Cake like im Hoopin' Im a Basket Case
Guardin' the Bank is a Long shot with Masking Tape
This my fuckin' Year Dog New Niggas gon' have to Wait
Bad Bitches and addresses, a bachelor's fate
My shades Seven, My Chain Dumb , My Jacket Eight
Racks on the peddle yellow Bezel cause it match the plates
Banks Stick and move Boy , you blockin like winky wright
Ill have her on the sink with a wink nigga you blink she pipe
Jewler Got my neck, Wrist, and pinky bright
Shorty you ain't thinkin' like im thinkin' you ain't thinkin' right
Picture Me summer time wheelin' chrome huntin' something pretty down with the killa dome
Different women every night but I'm still alone
I don't need the she-say fuckin' up my chillin' zone
Two doors and jewels Half a million shown
Get her in the villa and im feeling on her silicone
That girl ain't shit if he knew he probably split a bone
Married so she mops me off in the car when her nigga home
Wet and wild groupie lovin in the tub bent countin' so much money up I dun rubbed off a thumb print
I'm about a buck pimp soft leather tough bent im a trip to the movies every one in the club went
I'm cookin' up a plot to get the wuap
Brought my enterprise in the spot then set up shop

[Hook]
You niggas playin', I'm just sayin'
You ain't gonna get no help out here, you make the bed you lay in
Niggas try to push me out, I'ma make my way in
Sour D and Kush me out, here and I'm stayin'
You know there ain't nothin free; near then they payin'
You really shouldn't fuck with me, stare and he sprayin'
Misery loves company, we gon' put your name in
Once a snake, always fake, no explanin'

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Everybody’s petty for the fetty you get buried
Ain’t nobody worried we done been to hell and back
Boat, plane, helicopter, let my soul propel the track
Niggas talkin' hardly flossin' just a soldier sellin' packs
Cult full of lyricists killin' shit I’m the mastermind
‘99 prepared buzz here like I traveled back in time
Everybody rappin’ like they ridin' I’m the traffic bomb
Tick tick boom on you playa, lose your passing arm
Sought to pass when I beat her, I ain't greedy either
Cinemax, let the lil' homies DVD it
G’s by the 40 got ya shorty actin' naughty
League full of shooters that’s lookin' to score before me
Bitch you know I’m sporty, jewelry gaudy when you saw me
Only swim with the cap it ain’t mine take me to Maury
The goons got love for me poppin' stories out ya baldy
Vocals worth a mil', even more when you record me

[Hook]
You niggas playin', I'm just sayin'
You ain't gonna get no help out here, you make the bed you lay in
Niggas try to push me out, I'ma make my way in
Sour D and Kush me out, here and I'm stayin'
You know there ain't nothin free; near then they payin'
You really shouldn't fuck with me, stare and he sprayin'
Misery loves company, we gon' put your name in
Once a snake, always fake, no explanin'
