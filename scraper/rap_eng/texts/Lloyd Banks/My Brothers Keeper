2 G's Up, hold the spot down
Niggas turned they back on the click, we all we got now
My dedication solid as a rock now
Everybody standin' on top gettin' knocked down
BLAOW, how you like a nigga now?
Im stuntin' like a muh'fucka, wipe a nigga down
My style, gottem dumbin runnin' wild
Ridin' round town in a couple hundred thou

[verse 1]
Right back wit another one
Right back to my numbers son
I don't trust my kinfolk, it's like that where I'm comin' from
South Jamaica's number one, I'm semen and they bubble gum
Semen in ya baby mom, she havin undercover fun
Keep a pretty broad around, magnum when it come to them
Imagine what they do to roll, grabbin' and pursue the pole
Arrogant wit too much gold, actually ya puma old
Show me the money dog, Cuba Gooding Jr. roll
Movin' like a goonie so the jealousy don't move me much
Militant manuvering and buddha with the windows up
Foot on the pedal, heavy pushin' like they after me
Coulda' been dead already, He got another path for me
Niggas ain't half of me, they half lame, half hoe
It's big names in this rap game, they rats though
I'm bout cashflow, fuckin' and recording
It gets no flyer, thats like jumpin' over jordan

[verse 2]
See me wit the money, niggas need me in a hurry
I'm as grimey as it gets, and believe me they been worried
I'ma one man army, James Bond wit the bars
Wit collateral, I can change cars wit the stars
A phenomenon, first thing I did when I got the paper
Put my mama on, now I'm gone on Bahama lawn
I'm Montana strong, I did it, that's who
Get in my way, I'll crumble 'em word to my tattoos
Fuck authority, they want a nigga life stripped
Penitentiary vice grip, and hit wit the night stick
Stuck wit the ice pick, I'd rather have a nice flip
Saggin' out the white whip, Manhattan lights and nice shit
Braggin' rights and white chicks, havin' nice in-flight trips
Made a complete life switch, stumble onto the right pitch
Rounds on you, I made the PL Crown, remain the proud owner
Ya been dead *sniff*, foul odor

[verse 3]
Hop out in the ghetto, fingers rocked out wit the metal
Wit my angel, she spend all her time watchin' the devil
I'ma rebel, on foreign level, my flow is Jupiter
Thousands of times stupider, thousands outta the coupe for ya
Yea, all that soft shit in the toilet soon
I don't wanna collab, FUCK yall on auto-tune
All them niggas is fag, they swags got daughter to em
Tool em all up, have the doc push a mortar thru em
All ya days in the wind, homie we playin' to win
Praisin' and prayin' to Him, for the occasional sin
Go and lay with the Grim, real
I'm able to bend, steel make it able to sleep
Never stray from the street
I got a tiny sense of humor, trailer loada swag
Cabinets of cannabis, million dollar pad
See pressure turn kids into killers
Cuz they grew up wit losers, and wanna live like the winners

Style, and I'm done wit runnin' wild
