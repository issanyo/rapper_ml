Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or ugh..
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley, Bentley

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Shawty look at my Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Bentley, Benz or Beamer
The four door or the two seater
She’s all on me with no breather
My cologne's exotic reefer
And the chrome wheel is my sneakers
750 full body clap a plastic ke-ke-keep her
This is ether the brand new speaker
My girls a diva, me and lisa, Rosé and Keisha
Lets take things deeper, peddle pusher
Tire screaching you can’t ask girl to freeze her
He’s a pinky ring from freezing
And a hundred dollar season
New GT, millimeter. Get too close you’ll get my fever
Throw throw throw up as I roll up
Windows rolled up blowing reefer
Don’t compare me to no jacker I originate the flow
The flow is so unusual, nothing you have seen before

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Get in my Beamer, Benz or Bentley
My pockets never empty
I got dead animals on and every dead president with me
But I’m all about them Benjamins
All about them C-notes
Suck it til it’s dry, my pockets' got a deep throat
Always was a hustler, never was a fool
Always go that work but I never finished school
Honor roll lifestyle, nigga get your grades up
Highest in my class because I stayed down and blazed up
Graduated from the thousands to the milli’s
We drinking Conjure we graduated from the Henny
And now I got my night cap driving with my night shades
Call me a jerk but I ain't going through that tight phase
Clothes still baggy enough to let my nuts hang
Ludacris, I’m built Ford tough like a mustang
DTP I got my whole crew with me
Pull up on your bitch look her in the eye and then I say get in my...

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]

[Verse 3: The Dream]
Look at what I’m driving
Shorty you should be beside me
I’m gonna be your provider
I heard you a rider
Like a pony!
Tell me what you gon' do
Tell me what you want, boo
Hit the car lot, buy what we want to
Lloyd want to know what kind of car you choose
And after that I’mma drop a stack on them shoes
Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Gucci, Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Gucci, Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Gucci, Gucci, Prada, Fendi
Tell me, tell me what you want babe, tell me what you want babe

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
You know I keep the choppers in the cellar
There’s nothing you can tell us
If it ain the M its the GT or the CLS
You ain't got to see us, if we there you can inhale us
You either or niggas
You either broke or either jealous
Been a problem since niggas is rocking perry ellis
They really just don’t like us cause they wifeys wanna nail us
Just like we from Portland cause we blazing in their trailers
So we sharper than propellers
We sparking them vanillas
The Larkins and Barrettas, the narks is tryna get us
But we only getting chedder so we down for the whatever
The grass is even greener, the water’s even wetter
Maybach flying spur, new 7 even better

[Verse 5: Yo Gotti ]
I bought a set of twenties for my very first Benz
And then I left the club with my baby momma's friends
Back in '03 getting head behind ten
Club parking lot I never want this night to end
Mr. Cocaine got it, all I do is set trends
White on white Lambo with the fishscale fins
Yankee blue top, Yankee blue fitted
D on my block like I’m from New York city
If it ain't a Bentely it’s a beamer
Keep a chopper or a Nina
Keep a cutlass up a Chevy
Trunk sound like a arena
If it’s g-unit and it’s thug gang and Mr. Coca-ina
All the cars foreign cause they Bentley, Benz or Beamers

[Outro: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Bent, bent, be, Bently
