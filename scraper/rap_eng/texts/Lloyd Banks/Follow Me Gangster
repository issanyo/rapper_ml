[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, Sha, you're ready, drop that, Ferrari F50 style baby
I'ma show them how I do it, G Unit

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I keep hearing niggers' is happy, the D's come, niggers' with guns
When I'm out on bail, riding with some new ones
Big got hit in that passenger seat
Pac got hit in that passenger seat
Now I'm riding around in that passenger seat
Come near the whip, I'm blasting my heat
It don't take long for my juvenile delinquent thinking to sink in
The consequences mean nothing, them semi auto's is busting
Crack selling, predicate fellon, spit big words, but I can't spell them
Put a shot to your melon
That help your punk ass from telling
That I got that nine and that four four, the H2 on double four's
Bulletproof windows and doors, gangster, how about yours
'Southside' tatted on my back
My last gun shipment got the whole hood strapped
Now all I got is two three eighties' and a nine
Nigga, you can knock and tell the cops, but you're dying

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You can be a Blood or a Crip, nigga, bitch, follow me
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You can be a Blood or a Crip, nigga, bitch, follow me

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
I used to chill in the hood to support the fiends
But, now I'm eating caviare instead of pork and beans
I'm in the money green seven forty-five with seven shots in the four five
Y'all niggers' want to die
I've got a love affair with violence and guns
So this is for them gangsters', rep where you're from
When I got older, my heart turned colder
That's why the Mac react like a King Cobra
Now I'm jumping out of Rovers in Gucci loafers
Y'all niggers want to stun, I'll bury you cockroaches
Give me one year, in this industry
I'll buy enough guns to declare war on a small country

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You can be a Blood or a Crip, nigga, bitch, follow me
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You can be a Blood or a Crip, nigga, bitch, follow me

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Still walk around with the hammer boss, rope, and a cross
Hard times will make a little nigga hate Santa Claus
Your mileage is high, older than Diana Ross
I'm like a two thousand and three banana Porsche
I donâ€™t got to hire sluts, to get your tires cut
They on my dick because I make groupies set off a fire truck
My team in the cut, packing metal things
That's more foreign shooters than the Sacramento Kings
It's eight class karats in the border
I poke ho's in plastic to avoid a vaginal disorder
I'm a savage on your daughter, she ain't in the college dorm
Then I guess I'm squirting on the cabin that you bought her
I'm a heavy weed smoker so the average is a quarter
Brown coloured from shit he established in the water
You got Banks on your jersey, you're part of my fanbase
Just because you pour syrup on shit, don't make it pancakes

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You can be a Blood or a Crip, nigga, bitch, follow me
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You're thicker than water, ouch, twizzy wizzy wa
You can be a Blood or a Crip, nigga, bitch, follow me
