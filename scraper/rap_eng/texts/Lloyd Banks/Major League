[Hook]
There ain't no way out it baby, the streets been calling me lately
Infatuated with payment, the feeling made me go crazy
Avoid the fraudin' and phony
You meet your maker mistake me
Reflection of the pros that came before me, fuck you pay me, uh! Chronic by the cases, out here counting faces
Ducking, dodging cases, large amounts to faze us
Handing out the vapers with the cards they gave us
Bottom to the majors, made a job for haters

[Verse]
Uh!
They don't want no smoke, woulda been a problem already
And they don't want the underdog to get light, gotta go heavy
I'm fresh up out of a fewsome,  they bottom, losin' on entry
Lyrical bomb essentially, cookie smoke blot out the Benzie
Uh, I lose my mind too much resting, time's out went empty
I done bullied these niggas flows for protection, high-powered MC
Welcoming all competition, it compliments me
With practice, shout out to Century, started my rhyming frenzy
A bill and he wipe the hate gone, chillin', feet up like Draymond
You put in that work you stay long, Warrior's my parade song
Call in your props, your fame's gone
You were raised wrong
I done lost my marbles, traveled back to space for 'em
Heavenly mind in tape form
For the love of the evil dollar, I need to holla
Life's a heffa, i'm dreamin' bout her, new schemes of horror
Seperate from a team of power, blue dream and sour
Here's to the greenest hour, my verse is a M16s a shower
Fuck you gon' hold up the leanin' tower, I beam and pow ya
None of you punks gon' stop the show, block moves like Hakeem around ya
OGs stuck on gorilla glue, I remix the smoke
Push my hand in a cino, pulled a 100 grand and hit them folks
Line ups'll cut all the bullshit out, keep the clippers close
Land of the broken borrowers, niggas stealin' my shit the most
Her dude lame, and I'm rippin' through walls like Andy Dufresne
Thoughts of a missing screw brain
I'm Bruce Wayne
Callin' me get ya boo flamed
I don't care how trends change, still rock a loose qiang
Boredom on top the food chain
Fall on the spot Ka-Boom range
Same energy different coast
Decades now in designer, I'm ditchin' clothes
Poppin' skill, 'nuff bottles to swim in
I've been ridin' since window rolls
Jointed rings and timbo soles
Call your king, my intro's gold
Heart of me's never been so cold
Gossip's a bitches role, man to move 'round in silence
Planting feet on rappers neck still, mannequin challenge balance
I'm damagin', silence talent
Amatuers round astounding
Think your anchor, which one of you ship handlers 'bout 'bout it
New LP, I'll bring the glory back and neutralize the corny rappin'
Cruisin', over lappin', discography kept the shawtys mackin'
Discipline the wrong reaction, leave here in a sporty casket
Niggas only cool in this era, back then they all be average
