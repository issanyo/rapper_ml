[Intro]
Uh, yeah yeah, I like the way that sound
Nanananana noooow

[Hook]
Nigga do you got a death wish?
Cause comin' out your mouth like that is gonna get you laid out
So respect this.. tuck your necklace, ya fuck around and get found
Cause it's noooo love, hooold up, there's noooo luck when they rooooll up
You be laid down, blood on the ground
Ya run like a bitch, when ya boys ain't around

[Verse One]
Aye, if lately you been poppin' shit
Then you should press skip
Cause this is why I flip
You're now part of a hit
Ya dicks, since back then gettin' props was a thing to do
So everybody wanna box with the kangaroo
Like fat boy and the LOX just to name a few
Ya told a story to the cops when they came to you
Niggas built the green rocks so I changed to blue
Lock box in the drops and the rangers too
I know your wife don't make me pipe her
And break up a happy home cause she thinks I'll like her
These niggas been around since Biggie and ain't blow yet
Damn, how many chances ya think you gon' get?
Cause I remember when they suits were shiny
Now they in army fatigues, boots and grimy
My back's to the wind and my troops behind me
And if I get jiggy the suit's Armani

[Hook]
Nigga do you got a death wish?
Cause comin' out your mouth like that is gonna get you laid out
So respect this.. tuck your necklace, ya fuck around and get found
Cause it's noooo love, hooold up, there's noooo luck when they rooooll up
You be laid down, blood on the ground
Ya run like a bitch, when ya boys ain't around

[Verse Two]
Aye, when you think of the city, you think about the Unit
The team, some of the realest niggas to do it
The drama don't move me so I call troops
I rather snuff ya, tryna knock an eyeball loose
Won't you save me the trouble, get real bent
Slip on the steps and break ya own fuckin' neck
These are shocking words, from a punk ass nigga
Tell me to tell fifty, wassup ass nigga?
Got the Hunger For More in his truck ass nigga
Short so they used to take his bus pass nigga
I send 'em to find ya, high of the ganja
They'll turn the Marriott into hotel Rwanda
I can tell that there was niggas that used to smack you
Cause we don't ask why, we ask who
I'm done sparring, it's over, I'm through
Only reason you don't like it is cause it's 'bout you

[Hook]
