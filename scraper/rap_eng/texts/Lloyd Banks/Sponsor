[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Shawty see the colors all the colors in my chain
Shawty see the diamonds all the diamonds in my ring
I could get you I could get you get you anything
Cha-ching, money ain't a thing
Gucci, Gucci, I can be the co-pilot you could do the driving
You could be the star baby I could be your stylist
No my name ain't Gilligan but let's go to an island
First I'll make you smile but I'd rather buy you diamonds
And if I'm far away from you the ring will be reminder
That nobody can do the things I do I'll treat you kindly
And I ain't trying to flatter you but I think you're the finest
Damn you getting thick I hope you don't go on a diet
I done bought you some glasses cause tonight I will be blinded
Watch, chain, ring, earings and they shinning
Gucci Mane yeah baby but you can call me Ices
So tell your ex to hate on me I don't want him to like me
