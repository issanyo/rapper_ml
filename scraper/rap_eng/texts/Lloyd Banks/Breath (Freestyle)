Your boy sick
So move or the germ might touch ya
I'm at the rucker, burning them trees up like Usher
When I teach you how to rap fam
I'm in that black and
My ear-rings are Canaries the size of Pacman
Who gives a fuck if you sour boy
Cuz my doors got the windows from the 24-Hour store
I'm on the verge of flippin
Lord send me a sign, before I empty this nine, and leave the boy drippin
Me and 50 like Michael and Pippin
Ryu or Ken, whoever you send, I'ma rip em'
I had to lead society, mainly wit my system
Run and put em' in the trunk, like a kidnapper victim
I pop up till there pushin me harder
My associates got interior motives like bush and his father
I figure, I rather play wit these lames before i pass
Build a ball-court, go buy Bentleys to go to crash
I'm headed towards my prime
Wit metaphors and lines
And I compliment my momma wit pedicures and wine
I'm line for line, the rap Einstein
Pound for pound
Tyson a.k.a Icing
Left it for the record
I ain't sleepin for a second
So even if im naked theres tool under the pillow
I'm ballin so the view of the pool is from the window
I'ma smoker, so believe were the niggas wit the Indo
An angels nightmare, freddy kruegar to a bimbo
A dead beat to ur daughter
I'll fuck her and won't support her
I'm mashing on the pedal
Smile from ear to ear
Middle finger in the air
Hopin I catch her eye
Keep rydin behind your tints fuck
Niggas don't know no better
They'll rob you for the rhinestones in your pimp cup
They goin off what we say
Niggas is runnin over my bars, faster than Jamaicans in a relay
I'm blowin the Kush, driving lazy in the lane
Yelling money ain't a thang
Like Jay-Z and Jermaine
And ill leave you on a chain
Like Brady wit the aim
I'm the same
Whether the Mercedes or the train
And I may be on a plane
By the end of the night
But it's aight
Tho, I might go
I'm rich off a Mic Hoe
My stamina's low
X-Rated is my type so
I keep the crib packed in, no telling where it might go
Living room, dining room, bedroom, bathroom
Upstairs, nuts smeared all over your Sasoon
Ya im on that fly shit
That Southside shit
That I'ma sit on at least ten million before i die shit
I'm from the block where the heafers be
To doing shows out in Kingston when they rocking where your peppers see
And being gangsta ain't enough
A lil' nigga that's stuntin will put a killa in a box like Chucky
CHEAH!
