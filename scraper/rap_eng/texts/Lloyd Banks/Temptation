[Intro]
Yeah, that's it
17, loaded clip
Got anything you fuck with, I'm the shit right out the zip, uh
I'll be chilling hardly make it hard for you forget

[Verse 1]
The little rap feuds petty
Hand on the wheel, shoe steady
Talk with the crooks, new celly
I like my kush blueberry
I'm lightening, hooks, proof deadly
Excited looks, crews envy
Making your moves don't play me close might be a juxs too friendly
Line up the babies and all the smother the culture vultures
Plenty paper for all when I get the bogus over
Electrifying desires severely vault the soldier
You gon' need a kin you cross him, foolery results in coma
Running the pack on my solo, usually poor controller
You kidding me, dope epitome call my sculpture colder
Drugs been a blur, if I could only relive the moment sober
Diamonds and fur, my whole life I'm a set and stoner
Shine I concur, send my obstacle I'm steppin over
Grind I prefer, by the throne right by my first diploma
Shoutouts to Kur, you gotta a lot of stupid questions don't ya
Slid my LP on niggas make me a poster, uh

[Chorus]
Tempted by the fast life
Shook the ave twice
In it for the long run, fake love ain't gon' last right
Your drifted slowly and beginning business owe me
Where the loser leaves they legacy
The winner takes the trophy, uh
Oh now you want the fast life
Trips to paradise, this shit ain't gon' just fall on you
Hope you getting your cash right
Line your movement, do your shit you gotta prove it
You don’t know what the fuck it took to get here, how I'ma lose it

[Verse 2]
You ain't moving like a street nigga, be in your phone
The industry's energy's dead to me rather leave it alone
Lovely dreams are heat spraying, you speak cologne
Anything that you can't leave, leave it outta there leave it home
I left a mark on my entrance
Didn't event know this shit dancing by land mines
Should be minding your business
A request for more wishes, down on my wish list
Fucking shit up ridiculous, deep pockets and lit wrist
Born over a chump automatically raised badly
Gotta be fighting all the hood boys, maggie like trey daddy
Figured stupidy from those that came at me
Bitch I'm frozen, chain classy, clips of purple planes pass me
Knock 'em out send 'em off to the same taxi
Sneakers smoke on all the track, the feedback is you can't catch me
You don't think they gon' want it with you exactly
'nap an MC out the city and let him out on the back streets

[Chorus]
Tempted by the fast life
Shook the ave twice
In it for the long run, fake love ain't gon' last right
Your drifted slowly and beginning business owe me
Where the loser leaves they legacy
The winner takes the trophy, uh
Oh now you want the fast life
Trips to paradise, this shit ain't gon' just fall on you
Hope you getting your cash right
Line your movement, do your shit you gotta prove it
You don’t know what the fuck it took to get here, how I'ma lose it
