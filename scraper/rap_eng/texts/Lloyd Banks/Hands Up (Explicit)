Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
P-put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
P-put 'em up
Hands up, shorty when you party with me
We goin' way past quarter to three
(I said hands up)
I'm good in the V.I.P
I got my hammer right here with me
(I said hands up)
You know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jooks
(I said hands up)
Everything ain't cruise to fame
This shit ain't sweet as it looks
(I said hands up)
You know I'm puttin' something on me right before I leave outta the car
(Put 'em up, put 'em, put 'em up, we came to party)
You go tough talkin' at me you gon' leave outta the club with a scar
(Put 'em up, put 'em, put 'em up, we came to party)
We pop bottles like it's all free fo' I leave I'ma buy out the bar
(Put 'em up, put 'em, put 'em up, we came to party)
You can order what you want, it's on me I'm a G take a look at star
(Put 'em up, put 'em, put 'em up, we came to party)
It feels so good to live sucker free
I'm soakin' it all up while your girl suckin' me
It mean the world to her, it's nothing but a nut to me
Look miss, get a grip and let a motherfucker be
I'm a rap star who wants to be ridin' around in that car
Two in the front and the back got the plasma
This ain't a free ride you gotta have the gas ma
I wouldn't buy a chick a pump that got asthma
And I'm busy so I move a bit faster
You can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya
I'm a bastard
Damn near showin' his hand over the plastic
'Cause they wanna see your man go in the casket
Rule number one, keep your gun and get your ass hit, that's it
Lights off and your body's stiff
By the same niggas you used to party with
Hands up, shorty when you party with me
We goin' way past quarter to three
(I said hands up)
I'm good in the V.I.P
I got my hammer right here with me
(I said hands up)
You know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jooks
(I said hands up)
Everything ain't cruise to fame

I cruise through the strip, 22's on the whip
New rule: gonna hit thousand dollar outfit
Never snooze never slip, follow rules or get whip
Nigga move or get hit, I don't care who's on the strip
It ain't only the Ferrari now the jewels got him sick
Now it's 2006 I need a new bottom miss
It's aight they can talk I'm amused by them pricks
I'm the news out the bricks nigga who's hot as this
I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed
I ain't a cuddler I fuck the drool outta chick
My niggas ice grill but it ain't the same
They don't see the faces they just see the chains
Like Ooo when you get 'em they don't know you with me
They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me
This is regular shit the erryday mentality
They charged up don't make me put in the battery
Hands up, shorty when you party with me
We goin' way past quarter to three
(I said hands up)
I'm good in the V.I.P
I got my hammer right here with me
(I said hands up)
You know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jooks

Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
P-put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
P-put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
P-put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
P-put 'em up
