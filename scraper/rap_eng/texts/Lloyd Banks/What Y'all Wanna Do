What y'all wanna to do
What y'all wanna to do nothin
I'm rite in front of u frontin'
U kno how tha ballas do
I'm stuntin'
It's nothin
Now I'm goin 2 leave alone the neighborhood needs me
Been hot on tha record makin look easy
Anotha cd u take as a freebie
I'm chasin the numba one place on your t.v
Who known 4 takin somethin' & makin' freezin'
Come close I'm goin 2 be up in the post
To make a long story short big story about me & toast
I'll turn your emcee to a ghost throwin' dirt in my name
Tie him up & keep feedin' him soap
Be scareful NYPD want your throat
Any nigga with eyes can see he a joke
And he goin' 2 hang himself all he needs a rope
We ain't have shit but nine militers & hope
The stress of bein' broke turns weed into smoke
And I fear no man if he breathe he can choke
I'm hot from the trops through the barbershops
I move units from the towers through the mom & pops
Hobbs blue, green, & white diamond blocks
Makin' him sick like the feelin wen the condom pops
Eight 8's T.V.'s all kind of drops
No stress I'm come home best
Eskimo flow bring the doe slow is a no show
U know the fo' go everywhere I'm solo
Bout to hit the industry with a low blow
Playin hatin on me it's a "no no"
Step up or get stepped on
Matter fact step through your whole rep gone
Niggas walk around lik they have teflon
He ain't even carry and they all wet bomb
Out here u do the creep or get crept on
I'm gone
Yeah boy
U thought fukin things changed nigga
We run this man
Y'all niggas get the fuk out the way man
