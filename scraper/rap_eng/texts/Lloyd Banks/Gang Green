[Lloyd Banks:]
Its Blue Hefner
Gang Green
Ya'll can catch me on the Anger Management Tour
You know where the big money at

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I ain't the iciest nigga livin' but I'm a few stones closer
Hoppin' out my blue foam Rover
Feed my pit flock down on the two tone sofa

[Lloyd Banks:]
Its Blue Hefner
Gang Green
Ya'll can catch me on the Anger Management Tour
You know where the big money at

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I ain't the iciest nigga livin' but I'm a few stones closer
Hoppin' out my blue foam Rover
Feed my pit flock down on the two tone sofa
Decock my two tone toaster
I'm cakin' up
I can get a whip a week
And my momma ain't gotta lift her feet
She in the Jeep with a Swisha Sweet
I'm on the beach with a stripper freak
After the weed and the liqour meet
She will be lickin' me
And I don't trip won't freeze her with Tiffany
So if shes iced out its some gees she ain't get from me
My hands on your lady and
The only reason I ain't go to SummerJam is cause I'm banned from the stadium
Ten room mansion my lands a paladium
Creep in my yard its a can in your cranium
I'm famous and still ridin' around with a trigger
I'm a certified, bonafide entrepenigga
