[Verse 1]
Loud pack in the back, no sneaking past I’m warrant hot
Put everything in my rack,sneaker stacks in an orange box
Now she want me on the spot, I’m in there no alarm clock
Sprung her now she on the dock ,I bend her till it’s 4 o clock
A million and one more weirdos, they don't get no run around here though
I been loading this gun all year, so when it unloads
It might leave an air hole, pay your rank about 0
Major Bank on my ear lobe, That mean Gs up, hoes down
And play ga-ga-game of my heroes
Catch me out , chasing them zeroes
Zoo keeper I'm Furred up, new speakers I’m turned up
Due to reefer I burned up
Drinking like it’s my first cup
I ram that cat to a 90, Bitch Huh? Eat What?
I'll leave that to the zombies
Bet these thirsty rats wanna line me
Big old rat when you find me
Clean my wheel make everything shiny
I get back when the clock is timing, shit
Whoever thought we'd get this far?
This for those that died to soon
Purple weed around the room
R I P to Sha Da Goon

[Hook]
I bring the crowd around this bitch
I’m making this money
I'm rocking Thousand Dollar kicks
More drugs,more honeys
I need a lot of kind of piff
And I make it or love it
You’re supposed to pop off
You can’t get nothing from me
Hey,hey, I want it now, I want it now
Grab your shit and tell your girl it’s going down
I want it now, I want it now
Dope sex, more checks, yo neck, going down

[Verse 2]
Look, don't get on my shit list
I give all of y’all the business
Let your #1 fan be the witness
Is this #1 champ for the bitches
You lucky to be my apprentice
Ball so hard, got a slipped Disk
I’m whatever lobsters shrimp is
And I'm ringed up like the Olympics
Man, I'm making it rain by the inches
You dumb as hell, you claim to be
Means more than water
For being part of my famous team
Ring shatter hop on a desk
She said, I ain’t never come that fast
I said, I ain’t never done that either
If she only knew about my past
My bars are stupid-up, too bright, can't dumb it down
Riding round with my bulldog ,my new pup
All summer now, just had a day dream about last night
Had him scream in his sleep in a cat’s sight
Any girl any good get my wood
She front on me ,she ain't wrapped right
Hit a nigga for me with a flashlight
In the day time, and the neck tight
All it happens, nigga it’s crackin’
With a rock and a crack pipe
Shawty suck my dick , take a pic
Show and tell and go to hell
Fourteen carat, balling habit
Goldie ways, go Chanel

[Hook]
