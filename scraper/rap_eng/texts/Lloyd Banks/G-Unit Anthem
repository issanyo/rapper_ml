In my hood you get no points for your jumpshot
As soon as the sun rise, we back on the block
This stress got me feelin like an old man
So I stay on point for that red and gold van
It's the free lance performer YaYo be a pro
And the flows been hot, since G.I. Joe
Yo my rhymes have you nodding, like Raw in the Street
So freaks gimme ass like toilet seats
Get at me, you really think you holding big daddy?
So where's your in door courts, and bowling ally?
I got heart like a hoover crip
But bust slugs like an EngleWood Blood
I mengle wit thugs, my singles don't budge
Import, export get rid of tha drugs
Still pack my Dope up witta mass of some gloves
I use to have 8-balls in my 8-Ball jacket
Now I dawg lex coops, like Luke in Dukes of Hazard

I put carpet Burns on these Waxters these days
Till they need bandages on they knees like Pat Ewings Legs
I'm always wit the biscut
Only way I get blue balls is if a bitch had blue lipstick
You broke rob more blocks
You ain't gotta know how to break dance
To whind up on a card board box
I'm Gucci down to my sock, groupies houndin' da spot
Different format, keep groupies round for tha cops
She'll be down for tha watch, I ain't generous or courtieous
I'm running from a dirty bitch, nigga you thirty-six
Ya'll don't want it with tha kid at all
Same shit, bigger bathrooms my niggas brall
When we come after you, it ain't no graze shots
This nigga leave a hle in ya chest bigger than Flava-Flave clock
You pussy, I think even Pac can smell this shit
'Cause on the inside you softer than a mozerella stick, bitch

I'm the leader of the New School now nigga wut
I got a 4-4 bulldog, I'll tear yo bitch ass up
I pop-off nigga front, I'll put my knife in yo gut
Have you in I.C.U screaming ah, I'm cut
I go rawo, rawo, like a dungeon dragon
But I keep my pistol on me so my pants ain't sagging
Every time I'm in the house, niggas grill a nigga
But they feel a nigga, I kill a nigga wut
Excuse me, shorty, better stay in ya lane
Before I send one of my soldiers to blow out your brain
I'm da General wut, you solute me
You's a dead man if you attempt to shoot me
I done lost some of my brain watchin' military flicks
Got the whole G-Unit on some Military shit
