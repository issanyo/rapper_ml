[Verse 1]
Yeah, money knots from block ties, in the slums I'm favorite
Going over dumb heads, top five is an understatement
Antagonized 'til the animal out, no one can tame it
Whatever I don't live long enough to fix my son'll change it
Murdered every club you name it, tilt, flipped it and rearranged it
Married hustle, still celebrate the engagement
God's laughing at plans, won't take for granted the second hand
You wouldn't understand, your Yacht-Master never left the land
Take care your fam, we equal, don't see you no lesser man
No love for the weak side, dropping Fritos and extras, damn
That disrespect shit don't fly, G-code we check the land
No profit to be made won't comply, C-notes protect the plan
Soldiers with the same goal, poverty help connect the clan
All in the even playing field, find a ki and to stretch it, man
There's madness to my method, yo' ass is gon' respect it
Hit the masses, tip the record
They'll be running out of gas any second

[Chorus]
Same problems, different day (day)
Feels like the clock's working against a nigga
Ain't no time to drift away
Toys'll make the bitches play (play)
I switch my shit up for nobody
Doubters always gon' to have shit to say
Another K, another homi (homi)
I think I had an outer body, toast the illest shit you ever seen
If you dumb enough to try me (try me)
I put them numbers on you, you be having a forever dream

[Verse 2]
Uh, niggas got my name all in the talks again, you know he buzzing
Anything I ever did, I want it too, you owe me nothing
Gotta watch for enemies, top of the police dumping
Niggas that claimed to have my back then
Confidence told me fuck 'em
Very seldom seen in the mix, then we got the 30 with us
Hung on me for so long, what a feeling to curve these bitches
Kick my habits out, clear-minded, no blurry business
Haters see me up again, tears dropping with Curry quickness
Pardon my stance, I been pissing champs
Jeweler got my wrist advanced
Preachers no chance, help the consistent camp
I made a way for these niggas, peep my commission dance
I watched destiny slip through hands
Genius unnoticed by simple fans
Pictures flipping, don't care for the politics they watch
Funny how years ago Trump was giving me mixtape drops
Little crosses and a big face watch, pay the God I lift they stock Beggars 'round in the event the shit may pop

[Chorus]
Same problems, different day (day)
Feels like the clock's working against a nigga
Ain't no time to drift away
Toys'll make the bitches play (play)
I switch my shit up for nobody
Doubters always gon' to have shit to say
Another K, another homi (homi)
I think I had an outer body, toast the illest shit you ever seen
If you dumb enough to try me (try me)
I put them numbers on you, you be having a forever dream
