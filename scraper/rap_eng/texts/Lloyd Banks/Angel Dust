[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Feel the rush from this dust
Nigga this corner's us
(that's why nobody fucks with you)
Fuck the cops and their cuffs
In the ruger we trust
(and ain't no man above the crew)
Im countin' This dough before and after these shows
(Thats what im accustomed to)
You follow the code, loyal ‘till you’re down in a hole
(the only one they should trust is you)

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Aye!
Mind you fucking business
Don't get poked poking your nose in
I'm blowing up, rock's illuminate
From my explosion
Im the sho-gun! Sho nuff
Suck a clip bow down to no one! You know us, So Cut the shit
I'll cut yo penny pinchin' lifespan
No sleep losing anotha henny sippin night fam
So Keep it movin, diamonds blinding mr. iceman
He reach Aruba Make a movie out this nice lamb
Hannibal movements
I Ha Ha Harr I'll let the drummer do a number on you
Horrible photo how the flow go make the homi's jump
Another title for stripping equip Gennady’s punch
Crush the competition how im hittin like a shotty dump
Thank you's comin' low haters hollerin that's consistency
Waste of argument, paper following cracking history
Timing prominent now im bombing shit back convincingly
Every album gone miserable, terrifying mystery, uh

Feel the rush from this dust
Nigga this corner's us
(that's why nobody fucks with you)
Fuck the cops and their cuffs
In the ruger we trust
(and ain't no man above the crew)
Im countin' This dough before and after they chose
(Thats what im accustomed to)
You follow the codes or they take you down in the hole
(the only one they should trust is you)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]

My Tippin' hand is excellent bout 70 rhymes per record and my wordplay can be magic heavenly styles you should mess with
