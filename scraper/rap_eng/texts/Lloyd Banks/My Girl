[Intro: Otis Redding sample]
"I guess you will say
Ooh, "What can make me feel this way?"
It's my girl, my girl, my girl"

[Intro]
Hahahahaha, goddaaamnnn!!!
You can't be serious, man
Don't call my motherfuckin' phone over no bitch, man
Man, I, I think I'ma fuck around
And get killed by one of these niggas
Pussy's some serious shit, man
Nigga ready to MURDER over that shit, hahaha

[Chorus]
That girl ain't your girlfriend
She does the same things for me
It's plain to see
That she ain't who she claims to be
But you can keep trustin' her
'Cause I'm just fuckin' her
Look, that girl ain't your girlfriend, nigga
That girl ain't your girlfriend, nigga
That girl ain't your girl
Nigga you should see the way she smiles at me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, uh
I ain't never been a trick, so I don't offer 'em much
Most of these bad bitches won't walk with a crutch
And they dyin' to get out of New York in a rush
You got big dreams, you're just talkin' too much, so hush
Let's hop in the truck, and swing a ep'
After this, you gon' need a blunt, a cigarette, yep
I know they want see a nigga sweat
But I ain't tryin' to turn in my playa card just yet
I think about it in the jet
You ain't shit, but you hollerin' respect
That's why you feel neglect
I'm focused, 'cause that's how you get the check
Don't trip over your chick, that's how you get the TEC
Be easy, nigga, what the fuck you expect?
I'm a celebrity with diamonds all over my neck, uh
I'm on the road with a flawless rep
Nigga don't make me make your broad my pet, 'cause

[Chorus]
That girl ain't your girlfriend
She does the same things for me
It's plain to see
That she ain't who she claims to be
But you can keep trustin' her
'Cause I'm just fuckin' her
Look, that girl ain't your girlfriend, nigga
That girl ain't your girlfriend, nigga
That girl ain't your girl
Nigga you should see the way she smiles at me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh
There ain't nothin' like a chick from the gutter
A bitch comin' out her face, you gon' whip her and cut her
She think niggas ain't shit 'cause she live with her brother
But she's doin' the same thing, just undercover
Nigga, what makes you so special?
She's puttin' on that innocent act to impress you
Another nigga prolly got the hoe in a pretzel
And you only gon' find out if she lets you
Man, the right bitch'll have a nigga stressed out
Ringin' her cell phone as soon as she steps out
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the ex in the cut
She's drivin' your car to go pick the next nigga up
If you knew someone was gettin' the ass you're in love with
You'll prolly spaz and whoop her ass in public
You spend time with 'em, but you don't really know 'em
Man, I only trust a bitch far as I can throw 'em, 'cause

[Chorus]
That girl ain't your girlfriend
She does the same things for me
It's plain to see
That she ain't who she claims to be
But you can keep trustin' her
'Cause I'm just fuckin' her
Look, that girl ain't your girlfriend, nigga
That girl ain't your girlfriend, nigga
That girl ain't your girl
Nigga you should see the way she smiles at me
