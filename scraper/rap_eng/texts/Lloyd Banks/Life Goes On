[Intro]
Yeaaaa
We had it up too here, dear
Disappear, ya hear

[Verse 1]
Money makes the world go round
Pussy I'll make it all fall down
Faster than an AK don't fuck around
Or air out your laundry in the same town
I know it niggas going through this shit right now
Keep your head, hands and ya feet above ground
If you can't trust a hoe don't bring her round
Leave her where you beat her, she'll line ya
Only see her when she eat her
And I ain't saying all of 'em want it
I know a few real one's that keep it 100
Like a my hood love she even get blunted
We get high together and I put it in her stomach
We don't even argue she know I work hard
Her relationships a full time job
I'd rather be cool than borrow her credit card
And if she wanna go wrong I'ma let her, God

[Hook]
Life goes on
Another day another night I'm gone
What can't kill ya only makes you strong
Strong enough to make it through a female storm
Scarred so hard that she wanna do wrong
Car key ya paint job trigger the alarm
Cuddle blow your shit make you put her in a song
Now you probably tryna figure out what went wrong
But I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Right hands in ya pants left hand on the wheel
You ain't fucked in a while at least that's how it feel
Baby, I can get your fountain to spill
All down that mountain when we out in Brazil
I count blessings everytime I'm counting a mill
For that I hit ya fitted cap through ya windshield
Man pussy I'll bring ya in and take ya out quicker
Home invasions that ain't ya house slippers
I love women, but I hate bitches
All they wanna do is get drunk and take pictures
As God as my witness violate me there will be no forgiveness
Your on my shit list, ma
This ain't a hobby it's big business
Party like it's 2010 on switches
That means more champagne, more kisses
Iced out wristests and gourmet dishes

[Hook]

[Outro]
You funky bitch
Hahaha
Uhhhh ya last straw, ya heard
Stop calling my phone man
Fucking up the time for the real ones
Go get a job or something, bird
I hope I see you soon
So I can kick you in ya ass
Haha
Uhhh
