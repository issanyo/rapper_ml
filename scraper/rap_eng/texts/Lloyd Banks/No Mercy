I know the one nigga' two nigga', three niggas think they can see me
But I could name my competition on my pinkies. (uh-huh!)
The rookie of the year (uh!) - so don't come at me
You lookin' at the quickest way {MONEY... } to fuck up your carrier! {IN THE BANK! }
Yeah! - You only aggravating my ear
Addin' fuel to the fire, scattered views of a lair
It's not the statements, it's the egos I admire
Me and money go together like mosquitoes in a tire. (uh-huh!)
I'm waiting on the day to see you freeload and expire (uh-huh!)
I wear my outfits once your reloadin' your dryer
I got enough to last me, {   ?   ) and get higher
I can picture of little change up, play C-note 'till I tire
Got the eye of the tiger, patients of a sniper, (uh-huh!) [shot]
Heart of a Gorilla hustle harder for the scrilla'
Plus I know I'm a make it longer regardless cause I'm realer
Spent the early days of my childhood around a killa! Nigga!

[Outro:]
Yeah!
Lloyd Banks!
G-UNIT. In 2003!
