(1st Verse)
All I do is visit, yeah, I’m just stopping through
I don’t do the trickin’, if she there she copping, too
Told her I’m forever poppin, only right I’m poppin you
We ain’t schemin, pull a weaver while I’m speedin — it’s kinda cool
When I heat up I’m more demon, who you niggas tryna fool?
Got a herringbone that's freezin' bitches drippin diamond drool
Shorty think her shit the bomb, well my shit atomic, too
Every fit’s a body, check my new designer crew
You know it ain’t no holdin' Banks, I’m cooling throwing franks
Way too many bitches in here, ain’t no room for all the hate
Ain’t no telling how I do you, another room, a different state
Baby take my joint and junior? I refuse and hit the gate
Hefner got 'em A-Z, it’s full of VVS’s
All your sins crawling, your pimp calling, don’t need a reference
Gave ‘em fair warning this morning, lucky they catch us
Stable on my checklist: young, able and reckless

(Hook)
Can’t be bottled, all I know is this
All I know is money bring you haters and they piss
And I’m laughing, thank God, I gotta take the risk
Risk it all just to ball, all models on my list
We ain’t come to talk, we gonna get it on
I’mma switch — I don’t stress a broad
Keep it cool and calm on a bitch
Then I’m stepping off, stepping off
Time you get the rest involved
Yeah, let’s get the rest involved

(2nd Verse)
I’m the man, but you know that, though
Wife ain’t in my plans, let me hold that ho
I spent a Rolex on your body, let me see it
Every beat I catch a Homi, RIP it
Telly through the weekend, another break, the family secret
Like my green reekin, like the bitches that I be with
I’m like Edward with the cut, and now they messy from my remix
Thousands on the bus, thousands quickies in arenas
If I’m up in the club, then I’m Louied up, Gucci-starred down
Get your start down, all these girl, homie, they wanna touch it
Bring the cars around, making more money in my section than at the bar, clown
Ain’t nobody born with a bar code, they ours now
God’s favorite, fuck, I’m underrated
Like Kyrie with the rocks, I give her one a day then
Time to do these niggas fouler, every summer’s favorite
My cup overflows with power, I become amazing

(Hook)
Can’t be bottled, all I know is this
All I know is money bring you haters and they piss
And I’m laughing, thank God, I gotta take the risk
Risk it all just to ball, all models on my list
We ain’t come to talk, we gonna get it on
I’mma switch, switch, I don’t stress, I’m raw
Keep it cool and calm all of this dish
Then I’m stepping off, stepping off
Time you get the rest involved
Yeah, let’s get the rest involved
