[Verse]
Far from the typical, won't produce the regular rap fan
Head trauma the drama, big dawg gon' need a cat scan
Tuesdays are full of new albums to feed my trash can
Jenga killer, push you out your spot, fuck up your stack plan
Ain't a motherfucker breathin' equipped, sick verse fatality
I don't even know who's killin' this shit, split personalities
Mercy on the jersey that built the nerve up to battle me
The smell of burned rubber and fear on your road to agony
Sleeping's a guarantee, never been safe to stay in there
Run in your crib with hammers up, lay you down like baby hair
Got my Magnificent posture from a Mercedes chair
Latest gear, rude awakenings being couragous here
Niggas shootin' at the kid, watch 'em miss on a day to day
Shit I'm fly as ever, need my statue at JFK
Darts been goin' over heads still, slow down my play by play
Sittin' on ammunition, really just a grenade away
Searching 5 star spots, breaking my top rhyming
You steal off the table get eyes black as your sock bottom
Only helping me out throwin' stones, I'm rock climbin'
Killin' underground Power 105'n and Hot9 'em
Don't know what the fuck you put in that pendant, it's not diamonds
Fraudin' fuckin' up the game, visualizing you drop dying
Somewhere along the way they switched the agenda, who gave the junkies power?
Paper cuts from counting this money, don't trust a money counter
Gotta be the drugs, your favourite celebrity's cutting powder
Popularity's a skeezer, never gave a fuck about her
The God's been hunting, you tryin' to serve your subpoena
Still can punch you and I rhyme like Floyd Mayweather Sr
Being famous ain't gon' legend you
Ignore the fame they feed you
Weirdo niggas took the game again, I overcame the seizure
Ran my pen out on the regular, the normal train procedure
Cross the finish line my muh'fucking self in this game of features
From the slum to the Bahamas, they'll have to fil√©t mignon us
Went from running with the Kings to a king like Isaiah Thomas
Really how you threw it down, we all go to the same designers
Ain't no shoes on in here anyway, tell 'em cocaine align us
I'm as great as the niggas you pedestal and your flows tangled
Lay you out of winters cold, grown man makin' snow angels
Evil sparkles too, don't let the glitter and gold change you
Prophet in my best shot, superstar on my worst angle
