[Intro]
Yeah!
We back
It's a true G thing boy (haha)
It don't stop
I feel bangin' ever
My car go up and down
My shoes' $1,400
Go run it

[Verse 1]
Uh!
My rap's like crack, my 'lac's night black
My strap's right here, don't get yo ass clapped
Wheels on the chairs, a crippled ass bat
You see the clouds in the sky? I put you passed that
I'm drunk and I'm blunted, my jeans 900, my green 550
You name it, I've done it
I'm cooler than a fridge, my Jeweller's on his biz'
Bandanna bid, bitches droolin' on the kid
I'm self Jamacain bred, on a paper bed
You put niggas to sleep, my lines wake the dead
My women don't argue, they just shake their head
Cook butt-ass naked, and they breaking bread
Henny and hit no mix, my last fix
Now it's '09, we've been on top last 6
Call the coroner, let him know we got a lot of stops
Nigga touch me, better be with a lot of shots

[Hook]
You can keep the fame, I ain't came for that
You can find me wherever the money at
In a Maybach, in my Yank' hat
Watch the way you talk, don't get yo face cracked
I'm throwin' [?] around, 'cause my people on
Shawty eye-ballin' me, I'ma take her home
And when it's all set and done, I'ma take the throne
Street callin' me, I can't leave the game alone

[Verse 2]
If you look at the television, you looking for [?]
'Cause radio don't play nothin' but popcorn
It's fucked up, Big L, Biggie, and Pac gone
Every other video of [?] on
Fuck a "Beef Juice", we don't make up nigga
We ain't cool, if I ain't ever cake up with ya
I'm a Mack, you should take my picture
And I prolly [?] same bitch that lay down with you
I seen a lot so I can tell a hater fast
And I hope they all fall down an elevator shaft
I'm in a whole another class, no question
Top 5 alive, there's no guessin'
Every nigga round me trilla, there's no yes men
The rap game ain't real, it's all wrestling
Car dealer, I line 'em up nice
And I can bring my jewellery out if there's not enough lights

[Hook]
You can keep the fame, I ain't came for that
You can find me wherever the money at
In a Maybach, in my Yank' hat
Watch the way you talk, don't get yo face cracked
I'm throwin' [?] around, 'cause my people on
Shawty eye-ballin' me, I'ma take her home
And when it's all set and done, I'ma take the throne
Street callin' me, I can't leave the game alone

[Outro]
Yeah
That's it, that's all
[?]
I got the ball, [?] all of yall
Boy stop, you damn [?]
I'm way up with it, deal with it
Yeah
South side stand up! We gettin' money
North side stand up! We gettin' money
East side stand up
West side stand up
What??
