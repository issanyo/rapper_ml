[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
L - Banks baby balla’ of the year
Got about nine, ten dimes, and all of ‘em ‘iz here
It don’t matter, cuz before the night is done I disappear
Tell my new one I’m leavin outta’ the side
Meet me there
Yeah
Weed and bottles everywhere
Metal fulla’ hollows
I don’t mind a petty stare
I don’t need a favor
Baby, I’m a millionaire
Got a show hopping out of the lair in Tanzania
You ain’t gettin’ nuthin’
You ain’t gettin’money
Money make a mack more
More Henney more honeys
Hunned’ dolla’ billz, fifty dolla’ billz, keep the 20’s
Dummy, I’ma’ go-getta’, bitter, old ni$$a, spitter
Gold-digger, couldn’t dig ya’self a chip
Dig ya’self a hole, told ‘em I was cold from the rip
Zero zero man, need more of those in my shi!
Hoes in my whip, Mo’(et) till I’m sick
I’m rich!

[Hook: Lloyd] (Lloyd Banks)
Ladies, they love me
They’ eyes are on my money
They pay me and I stunt
And I can have any girl I want

I got ‘em like!

Go shawty go shawty go
Go shawty go shawty go

I, I got ‘em like!

Go shawty go shawty go
Go, go, go, go!

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks] (Lloyd)
Uh
Black Beamer, blue Benz, red Bentley
Audemar's sporter y'all
All of y'all petty
Heavy metal hangin’
Chain danglin’ on me while I’m boppin’
I can, see the whole crowd watchin’ while we rockin’
Coppin’, bottle-poppin’
Pop a cork like a sport
Hit a hater in the nose when I open my rosé
“LV”s and “G”’s all over my clothes
Bank rolls everywhere Banks goes
She ain’t yours
As far as flows, mine’s like an automatic
Mack 11 or dumb dumb’ll quiet all the static
I gotta’ habit
I’m fuckin’ like an addict
Area code scattered from the way I work magic
So tragic
Nigga run up on me wrong
Grown ass whippin bout 2:30 in the morn'
Cases of white brown and bottles of the Don
The chrome, chron', and girls on my arm
It's on!

[Hook: Lloyd] (Lloyd Banks)
Ladies, they love me
They’ eyes are on my money
They pay me and I stunt
And I can have any girl I want

I got ‘em like!

Go shawty go shawty go
Go shawty go shawty go

I, I got ‘em like!

Go shawty go shawty go
Go, go, go, go!

[Bridge: Lloyd]
Go shawty
Lemme’ see you go shawty
Show me all the things you do wit’ yo’ body
Baby this is yo’ party
Come and get this dough from me
Shawty!

[Hook: Lloyd] (Lloyd Banks)
Ladies, they love me
They’ eyes are on my money
They pay me and I stunt
And I can have any girl I want

I got ‘em like!

Go shawty go shawty go
Go shawty go shawty go

I, I got ‘em like!

Go shawty go shawty go
Go, go, go, go!

[Outro: Lloyd Banks]
Shawty got a thang for me
She wanna’ put that thang on me
Show me what you got girl
Dough, I got a lot girl

Shawty won’t you go?
Go oh ohhhh
Shawty goo ohh ohhh
Goo oohhh yeh yehhh!
