[Young Jeezy]
Yeah
So what you gon' do? (TNG ain't nothin')
When they see TNG doin' it (Gettin' low) (Strapped up in this ma-fucka!)
You understand me?
Ha (You know what it is)
Better get low, nigga!

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I'm just chillin' in that Phantom bumpin' that Yo Gotti
He's the boss of the town, call him young John Gotti
Sittin' down with the plug, 'bout to order up some tacos
Talkin' velveeta hella chips, nachos
And you really gettin' money, say cheese in this ma-fucka
Bitches on your dog like fleas in this ma-fucka
So many chains might freeze in this ma-fucka
Walked past a bitch like breeze in this ma-fucka
Black and gold stones, Drew Brees in this ma-fucka
Don't make me start talking quarter keys in this ma-fucka
Shell cases, night vision, ain't nothing stupider
Clips filled up, outta space (space), Jupiter
Don't make me start it up like a new Kawasaki
Drop me, hit ya in ya face, you'll be chicken teriyaki
While I'm on that new thug passion, that Belvedere and Saki
Chopping bricks with some chop sticks (chop sticks), I told you I got this

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
You know they mad cause cause cause I’m hood rich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good trick
You want a problem?
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)

You know they mad cause cause cause I’m hood rich
You never ever ever seen a nigga good trick
You want a problem?
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Wait a minute

[Lloyd Banks]
I'm who they be, Chronic by the P, living comfortably
Come with me, round and some would see why they fuck with me
Bentley's pulling up in three, multi-colored fleet
Y'all sour me, my summer's sweet, kiss my mother feet
Hate just makes chop 'em as they creek, life forever sweet
Life's a gamble and I play for keeps in these streets, uh
Magnificant flow or magnifique, Rookie have a seat
Them lil nigga just my parakeets, smacking masterpiece
My life is good, my bitches bad
I'm switching pads, changing watches in my christmas bag
I got the gift of gab, talked my way in and took some ass
Whips and cash, come through half stepping and then get whipped in half
Southside's my heart, too hard to forget the past
Lost too many niggas to the dirt, keep the liquor stashed
My flows off the ropes, uppercuts, stick to jabs
Shorty wanna grab, catch a couple nuts, hit the cab

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
We keep these G’s in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an altoid case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I’ma be at least about a hour late
I’m so fresh, bitch, I should be arrested
New Cody Chesnutt with my nuts on your chest, bitch
She said “Hey ‘Ye”
I said “Yes, biiiiitch”
"Damn, I’m only asking you a question"
I met this milf at the allstar getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I’m a rockstar, huh, start it up
Start it up, huh, start it up
So popular, you should get a shot of us
Niggas don’t take shots at us, that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic’d it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I platonic’d it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon' honor it
These ain't even real clothes, homie I’m pyjama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I ain't paying tonight I’m only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said “It’s free”, I said "WOWZERS!"

[Hook]

[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
Ninja (ninja), Kawasaki (Kawasaki), Ducati (Ducati), my old Harley (my old Harley)
Rock the party, (rock the party)
Move your body, (move your body)
Wassup, (wassup)
Everybody, (everybody)
Start it up (vroom, vroom) (uh-huh)
Start it up (vroom, vroom) (uh-huh)
Start it up (vroom, vroom) (uh-huh)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)

[Ryan Leslie]
Lets get it started, get it started, get it started yeah yeah

[Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and gentlemen!

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate
Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate
Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait
Where’s the dinner plates?
BMW, ten to 8, Interstate 95, passenger
Baddest bitch in the state, half Spanish half Trinidad
Complexion Henny straight
Y’all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can’t afford to be a minute late
It’s time to make a movie let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning 'round the bezel that's tornado watch
My independent chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for dick, I guess her plate's my crotch
Y'all soft as tater tot, little niggas try me not
Under the wings, fried rice at the Chinese spot
I hear ‘em talking it but ain't really living it
Opinions are like assholes, so who gives a shit

[Hook]

[Swizz Beatz]
Wait a minute... (echos)
