[Chorus]
(Everybody I know) is waitin to stumble onto somethin'
A few niggas'll settle for nothin'
(But I'm gettin' mine though)
Slippin' around here is risky
Especially if you gettin' it they hate on you quickly
(And I know) that I should hit the top
'Cause I been sittin' back watchin' this bullshit pop
When these hoes see a nigga gettin' paid they wanna holla
Another day, another dollar

[Verse 1]
I'm hooked to the smell of the slum of the Southside city streets
The crookest beefs is outside, (?) sleeps
Old ladies open they mouths wide in disbelief
Little niggas wavin' they middle fingers to diss police
The block bums got diseases and missin' teeth
And the heat's off, so they freeze (?)
My poor man sore guide where they go to war, right
The same shit the media glorified
I'm on my way to PA, weeded before the ride
And do my little thing then I'm gone, with me a whore'll slide
Check out my catalog
You gettin' bread, it don't matter dog
I slide through with a better broad
City expect that of me
I'm hot, so they wanna let the (?) splatter me
I'm tryin' to do five, think of the cheque that'll be
Banks don't walk, I let the jet carry me, yeah

[Chorus]
(Everybody I know) is waitin to stumble onto somethin'
A few niggas'll settle for nothin'
(But I'm gettin' mine though)
Slippin' around here is risky
Especially if you gettin' it they hate on you quickly
(And I know) that I should hit the top
'Cause I been sittin' back watchin' this bullshit pop
When these hoes see a nigga gettin' paid they wanna holla
Another day, another dollar

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it ain't nothin' like a hot summer day
Especially if you on the block in a drop with trey
The flow'll get you open like a shot from K
I am not wanna play, I am a shotgun away
Okay, you sound sound's like you got it from me
Lloyd Banks a.k.a. rubberband around a lot of money
Yeah, the same nigga from the (?)
But nigga don't get it twisted, I got my mama on
I ain't tryin' to kick knowledge, I'm tryin' to get dollars
Whip polished, but they keep bringin' the shit out us
I know dude don't think he me
How can he, put on the same shoes as a G?
You should recongize who's ya boss, before you run off
Bitin' the same hand that put food in yours
Now I floss in a European whip
There's a gun in the hand of everyone you see me with, shit

[Chorus]
(Everybody I know) is waitin to stumble onto somethin'
A few niggas'll settle for nothin'
(But I'm gettin' mine though)
Slippin' around here is risky
Especially if you gettin' it they hate on you quickly
(And I know) that I should hit the top
'Cause I been sittin' back watchin' this bullshit pop
When these hoes see a nigga gettin' paid they wanna holla
Another day, another dollar
