[Verse 1]
My haters came with cable change my lanes to flame the summer
Remain the same's my claim to fame that fakin' takes you under
We ain't the same I paint the game with swagger, drum packer Relate to pain, congrats' you made it out the slums after
Family by me only hope the phony learn disown me
Can count on what you want, then get your turn you burn your homie
VS stones show me when your hot your never lonely
Show me happiness without it then, my bag equips the power pen
Banks back snappin', uh
Without the appin'
I'm a dance away from trappin'
And still going to sleep g-stackin'
I reek of alley walls, cash calls
Feet up and Cali' coughs.. Run what? Don't make me laugh my Bally's off
Salvatore taller, kickin' off the heels of drama
Fabric all timer, million in the mericana
They done put me on Giuseppe let me in Balenciaga
Now i'm marathon don in to the power
The commas

[Hook]
They waitin' on a fix
Watch me fix 'em all
I put my blood sweat & tears in this and risk just the ball
These fakers always switch
Fix and get ya call
I'm in the ghetto where you gotta act, you outta here you stall
Erase the corny shit
Separate me now
Keep the business out the crowd, get the pie, break it down Ovations all we get
Second place is foul
We came all this way, ain't no room for hesitation now


[Verse 2]
Yo! Stories to be sold not told
Back out my face with cameras
Nine's like my weakest bitch, pump like Jamaican dancers
Take a break from time to time, where punks like to take advantage
Empty out your mind for mine, drunk nights and Vegas chances More great advances latest answers to your rap quiz
Got hustled by the Mac clips, rap trips to saks fifth
Sat in the best seats of your life, 10 rows behind me
Hit man, switch hands, click bam, bend flows for hommi'
My marksman hobby on a buck, Bent', Rose Bugatti
Ferrari scent and money spent, men codes abidin'
Collision records when I pick, dent hoes decidin'
Mercedes pilin' made the hood go crazy bout 'em
Amateurs rappin' they heart out
Really ain't sayin' shit though
I'm the one that's bombin' sicko
A hundred times official
Empty stomach, crime is simple
I Ginsu'd out the margin
You starvin' early morning bloggin', foreign car and Audemarin
Uh!
