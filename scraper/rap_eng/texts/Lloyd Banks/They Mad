[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Bad man I been a stand up nigga
If you ain't bout no money then I can't fuck with ya
Niagra with the flow, it don't matter where I go
Got the magnum when I roll,it grab a nigga soul
You don't have any control, all my tragaties can go
He just mad he didn't blow, Im glad I'm deep in dough
I don't flatter no hoe, I bag it then go
Should I wrap it or let it grow
Cuz I'm already grown
Weed addict full blown and in cronic colone
And a pint of patron will get me right in my zone
Get it, got it, I'm gone! tommrow I'm home
Got her number out my phone tell her don't come along

[Chorus]
They mad I did it, but that come with it
I fine with my nine
You front you'll get it
Got a perfect flow, the first one with it
Watch the lambo roll, and it's so kitted
They wanna be like me, cause I'm all I see
Your girlfriend likes me, she wanna one night me
If theres something on my white tee, I;ll bury your nikeys
Your destiny might be. PON BOX NIGGA

[Verse 2:Lloyd Banks]
Please little nigga, you flie little nigga
I cock-squeeze little nigga
You drop and bleed little nigga
Breathing quicker, hoffing and puffin for air
We got ammo by the tub and it's nothing to spare
Niggas acting all rough and tough but they scared
Weird, the unprepared, get flared and wheel chaired
I can't complain I'm winning
Getting my dick sucked by four different women
And the champagne got the whole room spinning
And by the end I won't remember the begining
My rims ain't spinning, except for when I move
Black chrome 22's that's grown man shoes

[Chorus]
They mad I did it, but that come with it
I fine with my nine
You front you'll get it
Got a perfect flow, the first one with it
Watch the lambo roll, and it's so kitted
They wanna be like me, cause I'm all I see
Your girlfriend likes me, she wanna one night me
If theres something on my white tee, I;ll bury your nikeys
Your destiny might be. PON BOX NIGGA
