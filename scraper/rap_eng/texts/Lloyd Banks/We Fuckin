[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Ten years later tens feel like change
Take cover muthafuckers gon' feel my rage
Shit im droppin all this heavy
Bought a real life plane
In 50 cities, bet they get the steel like james
I get silly, everything cool calm I'm witty
Mean a knock half off coupon ya feel me?
These bitches on call they could have a ball
Ego so tall make my haters look small
Teterboro boy, truckin' when the snow fall
He's no lover boy, fuck em' till they toes curl
Got your lady robbed, but you can have her back
She ain't' got no job and I won't have her back
Euro keying (Euro King), European (you're a peon), in my habitat. Catch a contact steaming on that magic pack
This the coolest nigga breathing, not the average rap
Money stacks thirty evenings, back to back!

[HOOK]
Let the reign begin, we came here to spin
And im riding benz, you can bring your friends
Here we go again, I just met shorty tonight and we fuckin'
I dont even know her name but her body off the chain
And im trying to show her something
Imma' end this champaign and throw all this money up in the sky like its nothing

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Theres a master mind behind these eyes. Sure thing, knew i'd make it back in 95'
94' 93' maybe 92' nigga we ain't even, you couldn't tie my shoe
Frozen neck, fuck you expect I'm from guy brew
Loaded neck, no respect for the rival crew
Times is hard and you strugglin' nothing I can do
Survivin' gettin' slobbered by somebody's boo
You couldn't leave me, I switch gears easy
My chick look like a model and your bitch hair peasy
I dont plan on falling back, you got to sit still to see me
Options in every city, in case a chick try to tease me
Im killing in the worst way, drilling on the first day
Mami said she shoot, imma' hit it till she squirt (hey!)
Since my first days, Polo what my shirt says
Now look at all this cake, its starting to feel like my birthday

[HOOK]
