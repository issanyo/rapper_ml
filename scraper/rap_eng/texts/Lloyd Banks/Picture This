[Hook]
Can you picture another girl to hit or ride with you?
I get around, I'll probably never tell you how I miss you
The hair on top of her on a fly nigga
You're here now, right, wrong, at it all night long

[Verse 1]
Baby picture me and you without the status
None of these losers had they turn, but only focus on what matters
Mac-11 when my leg in, fuck my angel back to heaven
Dime easily, that attitude gon' make me add a seven
Livin' like what I rap 'bout on the regular
Baby you made me tap out, you a legend
I pray I live a lifestyle like this forever
So every hour, every minute, every second
I'm dime stretchin', murdered by her mid section
Caramelized in complexion and I'm Dougie when I'm sexin'
Breathe baby, you gon' love me in a second
Enter my beautiful world where the ugly ain’t accepted
Your sex is like a weapon, you snub me when you love me
This shit gon' take some time, I'll love you for your effort
Heartbreaker and I probably broke a record
Lookin' for someone that wanna party and forget it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Woke up in the morning in the middle again
Cell phone vids and pics of me you and your friend
Can’t go to sleep without a ten, it ain't a rumor, it's him
You hear things like murder screams out the room when I’m in
I’m in the pussy so deep I feel her heartbeat
Room 210 not a menage suite, my name's in the concrete
Brought back the bottles and the zip, now we drunk and high
Couple models, that's eight lips, I think I touched the sky
That's for all the ones that used to front
You'll be luck if I venture back, I've got to peep and break 'em off
I've got my PYTs on tape, tapin' my fingers up
Upstairs shit can get real - told your woman such
All I hear is slow down, that’s when I speed up
Tag teamin' Sabrina, me and Maria
I got a lock on her mind, don’t try to free her
Hold on to that 'til next, I’ll see ya when I see ya

[Hook]
