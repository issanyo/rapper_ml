[Verse 1]
Why would I be shocked I planned it, Ima make it congratulate me
Lately ive been strapped tell by your dap, you moving shakey
Trace me can't draw me
Your friends will pick you up when your down, you made your plans surely
Do me a favour don’t visit, can't understand corny, call me I won't be picking up
The foulest plan for me, forty will shift a nigga luck
I love the hating phony, made lonely won't give a fuck
One of mistakes controls me, chains on me im living truck
[?] loui camo
Never ran out much lames, usually ammo grains, smooth as piano
When im getting doper, I owe that too higher power
I will [?] the same remain, get your name the tower
Pile of best of them, I leave them questioning
23 years season steppin in, my heffin got me fist full of rings
It don’t matter you really live it you live with what it brings
The boys won't be around a couple years, get with the kings

[Hook]
If my better days skip me, and everything should fall
Gotta charge it it to the game get it back stand tall
Im reloaded to the top, one for all of yall
My condolence, is where you put my back against the wall
Nigga you ain't never like me then, you ain't gotta like me now
Never turn my lighting down, victory I like the sound
Did it turn my life around

[Verse 2]
I give a fuck whos turn it is, im eternal
Can't jump in my journey, body count in my journal
I heard I died again, from a nigga that never lived
I get excited when you questioned all that I did
Did me a major got the squares out, im here now
Be patient in a stare down, my stations clear now
But theres still frowns
Im here bound, going to the game back down to earth
Too many step direct the aim at the turf
Gave em an act to follow, simple when all the style in me
Tables or magnum bottoms, put a 10 on reality
My nigga don’t be the next be the last
See everything half full
Don’t let em empty your glass see
Nobody gon let shit ride, on this side, that new York city big pride
Fuck matters more than the crib right?
If things go how planned we die together
And in the mean time they can target out on whoever

[Hook]
If my better days skip me, and everything should fall
Gotta charge it it to the game get it back stand tall
Im reloaded to the top, one for all of yall
My condolence, is where you put my back against the wall
Nigga you ain't never like me then, you ain't gotta like me now
Never turn my lighting down, victory I like the sound
Did it turn my life around
