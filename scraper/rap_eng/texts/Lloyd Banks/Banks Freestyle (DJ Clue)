[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]

Man, ya all know my name
B-A-N-K, Dollar sign, click-clack
The young gorilla out the clicks back
G-Unit's runnin' this shh..PAP!
As a matter of fact, its more then rap
You better stay with your gat (AHH)
These...white and black
How you feel about that?
I'm too familiar where I'm at
Can't run around with no rat
Whenever I sex I'm strapped
And stay away from the clack
You know the clack, you get from rollin' round in the set
I be slipping' niggas stuck in the trap
Runnin' and duckin' the MAC
Nigs..Niggas must be touching' that crack (Yup)
And I'm flossin' every chance that I get
Walk around with your advance on my neck
Im demandin' respect!
I hop out the coup, land in the jet
Hoes can't keep they hands off my sweats, G-UNIT!

[50 Cent]

(HAHA! I walk around with your advance on my neck)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]

Tired of waiting
These industry niggas starting to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts
While stompin' em out ya mans
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you grew up
Pull a shotgun up out the van and
They see me pop up all icy cause I could
But you been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood
Cause when you paranoid, its hard to make a song
How you want it with me?
Half of ya artists got make up on
Every night...you on ya knees taking taking prayer pictures
And you ain't even get shot yet
You scared bitches
You don't know nothing 'bout what pain is sucker
I'll put your team underground like a train conductor
