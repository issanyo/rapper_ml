[Verse]
Yeah, one two, one two
Allow me to show you how I do
Shouts to Jamaica, guy I brew
My nigga HP, he not like you
Man, fuck your problems, I got mine too
Black cloud out, but I shine through
Probably been through what you been through times two
These little ass niggas can't fit my shoe
Miss Lloyd had a very big heart
It leaked into everyone I knew from the start
I had a good life, she played a big part
She was my light, now everything's dark
Man, I loved that woman more than I loved living
Never care what she got, she was too busy giving
She told me, "be strong", but I cried like a boy
It'll never be the same, an unfilled void
Brain full of clouds, blame it on the sou
Can't think straight, I'm rolling every hour
Loyalty and honor, money and the power
Be a real nigga, taught that as a toddler
Diamond Impala, my Chevy on a slant
Kinda like my eyes, I'm heavy on the plant
D's on a hater, Pirelli's on a tramp
The man of the town, you can tell he got a stamp
Trust nobody, blame it on the gene
The DNA data  and the cop killa Queens
Rocks for the fiends on the on the blocks full of dreams
All day scrambling and hot bull of strings
