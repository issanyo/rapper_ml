[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
You'll never find another nigga with a flow like this
I got 99 lines to break a ho down with
A red beam in the club'll make the whole crowd shit
I got the grizzlys on me like Stronoun Swift
40 blue vest on me cause I took some once
Round here its like that even the shook ones dump
Bandana on my neck in case I do something dumb
Cause a motherfucker will tell the blue where I'm from
When I slide through the spot hoes huggin' and stare
Rocks glare
Like I got a lightning bulb in my ear
I got a zip of that Gueedo bud
And the fifth that'll drop a mean old slug
Directly in ya sunroof you'll see no blood
Just a big bright light like you've been hit by Mike
If I see something I like
I'm a get about three
Cause if it ain't about money then it ain't about me

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Nigga you should move the way that we move
Keep ya pistol on you everywhere you ride
The sooner you realize the sooner you'll see
You don't wanna bump into a nigga like me
Maybe you should roll the way that we roll
Keep ya gun on ya everywhere you go
The sooner you realize the sooner you'll see
You don't wanna bump into a nigga like me

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
These niggas all grown up and they still frontin'
Which means every nigga with a tear drop ain't kill something
The system in the trunk got the track and the grill thumpin'
Yayo on my right I'm in the back of the wheel stuntin'
Bitches know I'm only tryin to fuck and they still jumpin'
Niggas know I got the 40 on me and will dump 'em
I'm probably 'gon retire on pay day with two cribs
The same all from the Kay Slays and Whoo Kids
You wanna know I bring AKs where you live
One in ya stomach'll vacate a few ribs
Dog I'm focused so even if I slip off beat I'm right back on before ya notice
Niggas is broke
We pass 'em in the big body Rovers
Rap fiends my sixteens is Coke for ya noses
I don't argue with bitches that only adds me stress
I toss a bitch out the mansion like she Jazzy Jeff

[Hook]
