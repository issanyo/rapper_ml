[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If y'all niggas need straps, then get at me
I'm the plug
Well, if you need that, then get at me
I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, man get at me
I'm the plug
Holla when you need it; my price you can't beat it
If y'all niggas need straps, then get at me
I'm the plug
Well, if you need that, then get at me
I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, man get at me
I'm the plug
Holla when you need it; my price you can't beat it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
We move the work like it's water
Stuff a quarter in your daughter
Cash flow like the Nile
I mean like right across the border
You got to get it, I got it
If I ain't got it, I get it
Fill your spot up with product
I got the straps for your hitters
Look here, my price is my price
Fuck is ya estimate nigga
Youâ€™re assed out if I pull it out cause I'm blastin' it
Figure you bite the bullet, I bang it
Get to bustin', it's nothin'
Wave it, blaze it
Hit the bullseye, I don't graze shit

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
AP around me lately, C-notes serenade me
The smell made me crazy
Product of the Eighties
Numero uno
I'm out a legendary group hoe
My soul's too cold
They blockin' me, I found a loophole
I'm new gold
I got a couple dimes from Panama
I make a little girl out an amazon
Run on me, I'm squeezin' like an anacon'
Then I'm gone, years from now I bet my power steer my lawn

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If y'all niggas need straps, then get at me
I'm the plug
Well, if you need that, then get at me
I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, man get at me
I'm the plug
Holla when you need it; my price you can't beat it
If y'all niggas need straps, then get at me
I'm the plug
Well, if you need that, then get at me
I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, man get at me
I'm the plug
Holla when you need it; my price you can't beat it

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
I believe I was born to ball
Penetrate the pussy, unless it smell like old tennis balls
I'm a rapper; I got a problem being punctual
A mill at 26 these other rappers, man, they got the gall
To even think they on my level
Sports-Illustrated model all in my condo
Ice in the pot
In the trap, I'm Sir Mix-a-Lot
'Bout to spend a mill on a car lot

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
Streets dried up
Get tied up for small packs
Niggas workin'
Phone wired up, don't call back
I'm a surgeon; I put shit back together
I determined to bring my black MAC wherever
Niggas lurkin'; this ain't the place to be
Fuck a hit
Niggas'll blow up your face for free
Sunday sermon, preacher keep on facin' me
It's like every word he sayin' just relates to me

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If y'all niggas need straps, then get at me
I'm the plug
Well, if you need that, then get at me
I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, man get at me
I'm the plug
Holla when you need it; my price you can't beat it
If y'all niggas need straps, then get at me
I'm the plug
Well, if you need that, then get at me
I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, man get at me
I'm the plug
Holla when you need it; my price you can't beat it

[Verse 5: Kidd Kidd]
G-Unit gorilla
Cocaine car wheeler
50 grand cash to the car dealer
Bragging on what you bought get you raw quicker
Tap you on the shoulder like take this walk, nigga
I fought every tall nigga
Short temper
Tougher than leather cut from a different cloth, nigga
You ain't a boss you can afford to pay the costs, nigga
Get caught, I was taught to never talk nigga

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If y'all niggas need straps, then get at me
I'm the plug
Well, if you need that, then get at me
I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, man get at me
I'm the plug
Holla when you need it; my price you can't beat it
If y'all niggas need straps, then get at me
I'm the plug
Well, if you need that, then get at me
I'm the plug
Dope, coke, crack, man get at me
I'm the plug
Holla when you need it; my price you can't beat it
