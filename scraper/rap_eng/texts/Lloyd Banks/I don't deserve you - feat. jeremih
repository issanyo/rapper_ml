I think I love you
Don't let me get in the way
Don't let me stop you, girl
From doing your thing
'Cause I don't deserve you, no
I don't wanna hurt you, play with your mind
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way
It ain't even the puss', I got your mind
It's usually a one way thing but baby girl got mine
Perfection is the formula when me and her combine
Like candy to the corn, and yeah, you're finger-lickin' fine
In due time I'm sure that I can please ya, squeeze ya, weak-knees ya
Need you like you need me and don't mislead you
Love's free, but treat it wrong and pay the price
Get down on one knee, that bitch gon' leave with half your life
Man, believe me, I ain't gon' feed you bad advice
Slipping's easy, so don't forget to strap up tight
Ride, I'd be selfish if I kept you so, so
I love you enough to let you go
'Cause on the other hand, I couldn't take it if I
Put all I got in you and someone got you naked
You work hard for money but it's harder when you make it
These chicks coming fast, here's your heart 'fore I break it
I think I love you
Don't let me get in the way
Don't let me stop you, girl
From doing your thing
'Cause I don't deserve you, no
I don't wanna hurt you, play with your mind
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way
What type of nigga would I be to hold you up?
You need someone to hold you down and wreck your life, fucked up
I gotta shake you out my system, 'cause with the fucking and kissing
And all your emotions next to me puts me in a tough position
Baby, what am I suppose to do?
I can't control my actions when I'm close to you
We been away too long where we overdue
I guess the cake ain't enough, you wanna eat it too
See me and you have a magnet in between that keeps pulling me closer
I'm like an addict for your scream, your fully loaded torso
Automatic with the beam, the baddest on the coast
I got to have you like the green, your swag is more than most
I gotta sex drive that won't allow me to relax
Bring on the next five, look how they grind on my lap
Booty, breast, thighs keep your boy relapsin' back
And you deserve way more than that, I'll just fall back
I think I love you
Don't let me get in the way
Don't let me stop you, girl
From doing your thing
'Cause I don't deserve you, no
I don't wanna hurt you, play with your mind
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way
I been thinkin' for long time that
Wishing you were just all mine but
Maybe this is the wrong time
That I deserve you, I don't deserve you
I been thinkin' for long time that
Wishing you were just all mine but
Maybe this is the wrong time
That I deserve you, I don't deserve you
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve you
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve you
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve you
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve you
