[Verse 1]
Yo, a cloud of jealousy coming I know the smell
I know the money mixed with honey and hell
Tell 'em I meant it
Professional kill, terror connected
Bad weather accepted, a reflection of pain
Pay me in paper, stadium shaker, shady and major
81 flavor, blade tip came with the laser
Made my intro they've been on me since
Spotted childhood faces in my audience
Recognized by those that never saw me
It's amazing, how fast you changing, your mass is fading
You pass the blame when.. you hit the bottom, fame forgotten
Food for thought ain't enough, your brain is rotten
You praise watching
And the backstabbing became a option
And I'm still popping
My bold predictions came to play, from all the thinkin' bout' the hope n' bout the wish 'n bout a way.. out the struggle
Keep moving subtle
You win, they hate you
You lose, they love you
That made me leave the room a puddle

[Chorus]
You can't leave me here alone, I'd rather go together
The sight of you alone it get me through the bad weather
We compatible forever
My way out of the struggle
Walking the way that only lead the trouble
Damn, you made me love you
Without you by my side I feel like everything would crumble
Stand up nigga, you the only one I run to
You pierced a motherfucker like the gun do

[Verse 2]
Evil lurking in and out of you stare, I've seen it notice
I think it hates me, gradually takes me out of focus
You're the dopest, romantic hopeless, no one can coach this
Particular, but not the typical
She's moving closer, damn I'm slipping
You made it crystal clear you want commitment
That's just greedy, came back to see if im still who you missing
Kept it real for so long I need [only right] I have a lady
That lies around me, walk on top me, talk about me crazy
Yeah, play me I was stupid too
Cause everybody plays the fool twice
I gave a new life then blew my cool
People change carry them don't kill you walking the [?]
Eliminate the expectations, disappointment will follow
Your loves hollow
No problem which'll hope to catch a smile
Promise to make no promises i only let you down, cupids foul
Hit a nigga with the stupid arrow (ale)
Decade of backstabbing behavior I'm used to now

[Hook]
You can't leave me here alone, id rather go together
The side of you alone it get me through the bad weather
We compatible forever
My way out of the struggle
Walking the way that only lead the trouble
Damn, you made me love you
Without you by my side i feel like everything would crumble
Stand up nigga, you the only one i run to
You pierced a motherfucker like the gun do
