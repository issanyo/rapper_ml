It's time for nigga's sync', these duds got the trap clogged
I'm in the chronic cloud, trading bars with the rap Gods
Assault and battery 'cause your back charged
Reach until you get ran over, by the Mac truck
Movie I be Goldy, only nigga in the top five holdin' two slots, the new me and the old me
New-schoolers leave here slowly, uncozy and your mind petty
Rewind that, 'cause I been shinin' like Mulberry
Nigga' please, my arctic aura make your CD's freeze, I bought the bottles in your TBT's
Like a planet came back, they said I couldn't
Devil wanna' trap the hoodlum', hundred young blacks a good win
Game time, front row seat 'n your nose bleedin'
You outa' line, holdin' your dome, the souls leavin'
All the extra flows left home, it's pro season
A hundred parties standin' in line, your hoes freezin'
Wait?
Pictures of your bill, still skippin' on your bills, always scam and never tip, a hater's story for real
Got the plug to link me everywhere, the cush and bread remedy
Fifteen years countin' money, cut me, bled Hennessy
Victory go good with me, ya'll ain't got no chemistry
You ain't got no business here, you ain't never been no where
Demo out the window, here! .. You nigga's usually miss
Head crack, four, five trips off the Louis kicks

Yea! Better recognize btich!

The ratings ain't accurate
They owe me accolades
You got through by accident, bitch ass nigga's be passionate
Picture you passin' me
I'm out the galaxy
Glaciers make your lady gallivant, different salary
Eye of Blue, clarity
Send a block a Tylenol for all the niggas mad at me, just forward me the casualty
You born to be an average seed, I think I been there twice
Shawty keep it real with the realest nigga in your life
Homie curved you up, actin' stupid, knocked you down
Air-heads, slay him, that's a alley-oop from outa' bounds
Homi's a monogamy
Then flee the town, build my colony, hoes in the comradery, you down?
Send me coppin' to the top again
You use your oxygen for gossipin'
Refuse to chat, let's take the consequence
Suicidal I'm convinced
Gotta' remove a lot of compliments
Shout out to Blue and I've been rockin' since

Yea! CC3 on the way
Two G's up!
