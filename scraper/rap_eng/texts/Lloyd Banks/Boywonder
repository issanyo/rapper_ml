Again

[Verse]
Now they call me Boywonder, but I'm better known as Banks
Got a nine-millimeter; I'll put nine in your tank
You think that I'm a slip
Nigga, hop up off my dick
And the things'll B-A-N-G
So, please don't envy
Niggas get paranoid whenever I come to town
The one your girls fuckin' whenever you're not around
You clown
They feel my sound
And they hear me when I spit
How my jewelry got baguettes and canaries in every chip, dick
Fuck pol'; you can't scare me on a trip
My jet skis ridin' in Miami with a chick that's thick
A hollow tip could turn ya man into a bitch
Have him hidin' in the closet by the Spaniards and the fish
And I know I'm gettin' money, but I plan on gettin' rich
See I come from the gutter where there's cameras in the bricks
You should see how I'm sick when I'm ridin' through the hood
You're tired of being broke and mad that I'm doin' good
The police's daydreamin' of havin' me on that hood
Harrassin' me for I.D. and naggin' me 'cause they could
But I'm still blowin' wood
And grabbin' it out the jar
I'm a G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R
