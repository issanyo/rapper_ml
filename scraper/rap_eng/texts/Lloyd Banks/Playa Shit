You should hear all the bullshit they try to shoot me (uh-huh!)
Just cause I'm in the hotel lobby don't mean I'm a groupie. {NON STOP! }
Look shorty I could care less (less!); and you could always go home
There's other females in the hallways to bone
Be the same one that's always alone - while her friends gettin' dunn an' dirty
Down in room 130 - nut on her son's Jersey
I'm dunn, miss! - And the flick of one wrist
Then they go back home to they boyfriends and tongue kiss. {COME ON!}
I neva had a wifey! (no!) But that don't mean I'm lookin'
I woulda been left my OG, but I needa cookin'
Cause I been stuck on the road! - Every day KFC
As soon as I'm done; she on her knees A.S.A.P. {Whooooooo! }
I pro'lly neva change! (no!) - Bank$ is a gigalo! (no!)
Save the fussin' fer Justin! - You can "Cry A River" ho. (ho!)

[Outro 1:]
You know you can't expect me to be a nice guy... all the time. {HAHA!}
You know what grandma ma always used to tell me when I was younger
"Baby the only thing open after 3 o'clock... is legs and fast food."
