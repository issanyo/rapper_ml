(Hook)

Girl don't let them hoes in the way it only make they day you fuck around & don't stay let's play
I think we owe it to em
Fuck the shit they talking what we got won't stop
I hope the fucking takes the problems away you be bugging if you give them any time of your day don't stray
I think we owe it to em
Block out all the bullshit we go right to the top

(1st Verse)

You keep giving me warnings of dipping but never do so
I'd hunt your mothafucking ass down where would you go
You forgot you were dimming gave you a new glow
It was up to you must spend my day ducking im down to shoot tho
Drama comes with everything trying to kick my medicine Dodging what the petty bring way too much adrenaline
I'm guaranteed to handle your fix shoot up this heroine
Stronger than my last time time high man called a veteran
Waiting on me hopefully you was supposed to be close to me Around the corner putting my effort in I don't work for free
I speed there over minor shit feels like an emergency
Know what the fuck it is now who want to deal with uncertainty
Sour dreams are murking me cowards won't show no mercy too
You'll never have a seat here it's business never personal
Broke my way out the block spell made it out of a curse or 2
Nerve of these niggas looking something & never spoke for you

(Hook)

Girl don't let them hoes in the way it only make they day you fuck around & don't stay let's play
I think we owe it to em
Fuck the shit they talking what we got won't stop
I hope the fucking takes the problems away you be bugging if you give them any time of your day don't stray
I think we owe it to em
Block out all the bullshit we go right to the top

(2nd Verse)

It's hard for me to focus your stressing me to the limit
At least till I fuck your brains out turn on your spirit
Cause your attitude been draining me thin now when I'm near it
More than handfuls to bare it you one of one no way to compare it
Maybe if you put in your effort we could break a record even through separation manage to stay connected
I know just how to hook you new ways perfected
Open window to look through make sure you remain respected
I got chronic by the book bag bottles that you can't take no more
Trying to get to the top come on stalling ain't got the patience for
Never really went anywhere now we on a vacation tour
Ghost shop till you drop now Benjamins help you rape the store
You don't got to worry to make it right I will break the law
Blast away your whole life foreign key in the spaceship door
Rolling out to the penthouse made it up from the basement floor
Living like they would like to gets you hate galore

(Hook)

Girl don't let them hoes in the way it only make they day you fuck around & don't stay let's play
I think we owe it to em
Fuck the shit they talking what we got won't stop
I hope the fucking takes the problems away you be bugging if you give them any time of your day don't stray
I think we owe it to em
Block out all the bullshit we go right to the top
