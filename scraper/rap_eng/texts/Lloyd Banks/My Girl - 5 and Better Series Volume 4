[Otis Redding:]
"I guess you will say
Ooh, "What can make me feel this way?"
It's my girl, my girl, my girl"

[Intro: Lloyd Banks]
Hahahahah Godddddd Damnnnn
You can't be serious, man
Don't call my motherf*cking phone over no b*tch, man
Man, I-I think Imma f*ck around and get killed by one of these n*ggas
Pussy is some serious sh*t, man
N*gga ready to murder over that sh*t
Hahaaaa

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
That girl ain't your girlfriend
She does the same things to me
It's plain to see
That she ain't who she claims to be
But you can keep trusting her, 'cause I'm just f*ckin' her
That girl ain't your girlfriend, n*gga
That girl ain't your girlfriend, n*gga
That girl ain't your girl
N*gga, you should see the way she smiles at me

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I ain't never been a trick
So I don't offer her much
Most of these bad b*tches won't walk with a crutch
And they dyin' to get out of New York in a rush
You got big dreams you just talking too much so hush
Let's hop in the truck and swing an ep'
After this
You gon' need a blunt or cigarette (yup)
I know they wanna see a n*gga sweat
But I ain't tryna turn in my player card just yet
I think about it in the jet
You ain't sh*t but you hollering respect
That's why you feel neglect
I'm focused
"Cause that's how you get the check
Don't trip over your chick That's how you get the tech
Be easy, n*gga
The f*ck you expect?
I'm a celebrity with diamonds all over my neck
I'm on the road with a flawless rep
N*gga don't make me make your broad my pet
'Cause

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
That girl ain't your girlfriend

That girl ain't your girlfriend, n*gga
That girl ain't your girl
N*gga, you should see the way she smiles at me

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, uh
There ain't nothing like a chick from the gutter
A b*tch coming at her face she gon' whip her and cut her
She think n*ggas ain't sh*t 'cause she live with her brother
But she's doing the same thing just undercover
N*gga, what makes you so special?
She putting on that innocent act to impress you
Another n*gga probably got the hoe in a pretzel
And you only gon' find out if she let you
Man
The right b*tch will have a n*gga stressed out
Ringing her cellphone as soon as she steps out
You ain't thinking about the ex in the cut
She driving your car to go pick the next n*gga up
If you know some n*gga is getting the ass you in love with
You probably spazz and whip her ass in public
You spend time with 'em but you don't really know 'em
Man I only trust a b*tch as far as i can throw 'em
