(Drama Intro)
All or Nothing
Please don't let them turn this country into the purge
So we could all live it up for the rest of our lives
As usual, Banks with the wise words
And like that..

[Verse 1]
I rather chop mine up for solo than eat off a shady plate
My wisdom potent enough for two juniors
My babies babies straight
Trust no body on my plates me and my crazy steaks
Celebrating I'd rather blow my candles out Mercedes cake
This for my doubters gave me hate
Second guessing I caned them down 10 toes
Niggas you thought was fly I had to lend clothes
Called it a day I'm blowing Cadillac and Porsche, Benz, Rolls
Pause in my favorite moments
Getting money turns friends foes
Lied in your face red nose
Trouble they near you cut my ties wide
Niggas rather support the unfamiliar
Armored wearer gun concealer
Catch you slipping you breathe wrong
Dough beginner, you got to bend hundreds to put the sleeves on
Insults ain't even on best, sneak dissing the flow god
I clean out all these new niggas, remixing my old bars
Timing is a big plus, streets missing me so far
Dragging them by their feet, added to my mystique

[Hook]
I got my ears all on the street
The strong appraise the weak
I always got the time to take it there
Most will face defeat
Schemers out here on the creek
Waiting for you to sleep
Everybody bought a dollar the price of life is cheap
If you been the places I've been
You know a thing about survivin'
Keep it on cos niggas recognizin'
You prosper from the strivin'
They want you down when you risin'
But I ain't with the duckin' or the dodgin'
The devil sneaking 5s in
They rob still cheat and lie when, you get on they gon seek Providing I'm mobbing
I'm ready for the problem, riding
Window open up for enterprising

[Verse 2]
I had the closest ones that love me took from me
That hurt my heart
Scarred the boy in me
Now pains here hoping we grow apart
The ghetto gruesome after dark
The ghouls let vials loose in the park
''Hey, the smart gon' stop us there, careful how you choose your remarks!''
I'm back killin' 'em, approach the studio the track shiverin'
My ancient jewelry glow subtracts middlemen
Rings up to the sky 'cause they wanna full clip your health
Crooked copper want my ID, got' reach for that shit yourself
More than 15 years of shinin', dip my microphone in diamonds
I'm in 'lex McQueen linen, linin' these Mc's up
Home where the demons ride November
Politics disguise agenda
End of the world as we know it
Poet pen what I remember
Sense temptation I U-turn her
Concerned that they might switch
Bullets for my ghost, pillow covered burner like quick
Rigged soles under my Louis loafs, 'cause slippin's detrimental
Met you niggas with my grip on
Fake love always sits wrong

[Hook]
I got my ears all on the street
The strong appraise the weak
I always got the time to take it there
Most will face defeat
Schemers out here on the creek
Waiting for you to sleep
Everybody bought a dollar the price of life is cheap
If you been the places I've been
You know a thing about survivin'
Keep it on cos niggas recognizin'
You prosper from the strivin'
They want you down when you risin'
But I ain't with the duckin' or the dodgin'
The devil sneaking 5s in
They rob still cheat and lie when, you get on they gon seek Providing I'm mobbing
I'm ready for the problem, riding
Window open up for enterprising
