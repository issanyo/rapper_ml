Yeah! - Throw up your double G's, they don't want no trouble please
Tooly in my dungaree's, I'm moody when it come to cheese
Puttin' up the summer keys to cop another couple V's
Category comfort. - Puffin' on different color trees
Hammers with the rubber sleeves, scramble when you come from Queens
Gamble till you ass bet. - Assets and bundle dreams!
Swag probably? Cavale? I'm all about a Benji
Billion Dollar day dreams - girls flockin' a frenzy
In my Bentley! - The gold digger see me and see Fendi;
Blue? - I see through 'em, I'm a gone - like a Hemmy!
Remy Martin with the Coke, got me on a slippery slope
Respect me cause if you don't, I won't help him. - He'll be smoked!
Catch me somewhere on the boat, yellow gold canary rope
Stretchin' out your shorty puss' pokin' out your shorty throat
I'm a fiend for success, yes! An addict for the wealth
Save a nigga the jailtime you bought a 'matic yourself

Momma's diamond, I flew from the stoop to the shelf
Now it's everythin designer Louis shoes and I felt
One of my homies told me he ain't really stressin' if he live a lot
A couple weeks later - he's government candlelit the block
Little niggas pitchin' rock. - And their little sister hot!
Cause it ain't no "Mr. Home" - public assistance drop!
I'm walkin' anywhere, pick a spot, I be there
Nigga reconcile the mommies won't slide me in
Cartridges and Cardier. - It ain't cool to party here
You gon' need a army Tommy-gun - and survival gear
Hate me? - I don't care! Catch me at the bank, (uh!)
Presidential roll up especially out the tank!
Niggas hoppin' hood to hood they ain' even in one set
I spot a cow from a mile, I ain't missed one yet! - Yep!
