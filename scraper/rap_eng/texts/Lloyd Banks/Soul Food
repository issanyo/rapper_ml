[Verse]
You should know that I come thru in the clutch
Ain't been no choking them
The struggle either worry or pray
Don't do both of them
They'll question what you got in stored then pop up at your opening
Fingers broke on jumpers for trying to climb on the boat again
Still hear my haters label me loser feel like I'm suppose to win
If I don't get it first time scrapping ain't no re vocaling
I always been somewhere in the picture you wasn't focusing
Questioning my spot you alone and somebody coaching them
Clip your circle from start cause the other half was bluffing
Bet they turn they back on you only when you need to ask for something
You need every vision to see the traffic coming
Negativity is contagious hope I don't catch it from em
Good at many things but mastered nothing
I told my maker I'ma make it in our last discussion
Been given all that I needed how can I ask for something
Dipping and diving out of corruption
I did everything I could plus extra figured they can’t complain
They see you as a friend or the F is for financial gain
Don't matter how sun shining always a chance for rain
Figured you would keep a open door then the cancer came
Sticky for sleep rose champs for pain
We all called by the evils don't do the dance of shame
Check the masterpiece I’m making in my custom apron
Life is too short to be out here faking
Grownups held the panicking so we ain't recognize the pressure of the obstacles that come cause there ain't settling for less
You got to get up off your ass create advantages forever
Whether any storm that comes can you keep the chemistry together
You should dream about how I make you remember me forever Then I made it, something to play nothing to play with
Nigga tell me shit don't look n sound the same how I'ma notice you Yea everything got a lane but their ain't no quotables
I think its time to switch up a lil production over used
Fuck is going on niggas fussing over views
Envy from the flunk cause its fluctuating
Tired of suffering poverty keeps us suffocating
I'll be damned if I fall its too many busters waiting
They don’t want to see me thriving hear too much you hating
To me its clear I got to find out who the fucks debating
Trying to merge these dollars in the hustlers nation
Inspired by figments of my imagination
You slept on me you played yourself congratulations
Me and my alter ego the perfect collaboration
Should've gave my family more moments I just had to waste em Life's a bitch and you die while we paraphrasing
Shh listen niggas be out here rattle snaking
They chasing followers followed by aggravation
Signing the fuck out standing ovation
