They kind, talk shit to you and sue you
Don't let them fool you, boxed in results of beating 'em brutal
Nigga I ain't the new you! I'm the first me!
Unrated version in a armored suburban
And the picture lights curving ain't nothin for certain
Close friends be turning Fuck it! Close his curtain
It's darker on the other side
God let my number slide, hot since Benz's was bubble eyed
Only green matters besides that, I'm color blind
Duckin' 21 jump street undercover time
Catch me in the street one deep handle rubber nine
Niggas yappin off bout mine, another trouble sign
Pricks handin out tips on me and my click
Private investigating on that CSI shit
Keep your mind quick and your dirt low, people gossip
Single than a muh-fucka! you ain't sleep with my chick
Ain't shit changed boy, same click same Lloyd
Same phenominal flow that got the game noise
Still got the flamer to bend ya control your anger
Nigga won't come out no more like Kramer!
Danger, mayhem, murder mishaps and clicks clacks
Surgery through six packs, beef all over this rap
I'll get you gift wrapped Send your ass back!
Family and friends tighter than my last track
Hollow-tips and politics heading into November
Bottles sipped to model chicks shit that I don't remember!
I'm a lender, and your a borrower, a fucking pretender
I'm on it every month now see you niggas December, Remember!
