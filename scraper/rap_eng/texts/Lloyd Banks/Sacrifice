[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
My logo’s been my slogan solo’s better for me movin'
Niggas chatter more than females these days, take down your movement
This illusion got your family choosin', demand a redo
Funny the hand that stabbed you be the one you used to feed too
Should've caught the preview out there puttin' on for people
Life's a trip without the needle, insane that's how this fame'll leave you
Thought I was sleepin, now it's bangin' out these dangerous sequels
Smile about a blue moon, style like a stainless eagle
Ain't no use for excuses, know where complainin' leaves you
Bet they trade it all in for the sake of entertainin' people
Everybody co-signin' that? I guess it's fakin' season
Even when you get it, shit's hard, you got to shake the key in
This centuries rhyme bully, don't tempt me buy jewellery
Them Bentley rides pull me, over empty minds fully
Bloated, decoded, gotta' question them niggas you role with
Super slow ass niggas, get on my old shit

[Hook]
I waited for it all my life
Don't think about it, role the mother fuckin' dice
The price of sacrifice
Cause all the glitter's over-hyped
Nobody there tomorrow if it's all gone tonight
The doubtin' makes the battle right
I bet it all, they waitin' for you take your fall
Envy got an appetite
And I got a thing for heights
I'm gonna' come back and do it twice

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Uh! Certified from the curtain rise, murder verbalized
Purple eyes, heat the beginners lift up your first disguise
Your heart ain't even half way in it, you're just a poster striver
A hundred in this cash race tinted, just put me close to God
Just stay back with your facade, you got me almost, no cigar
Who's coachin' y'all?  Cloud of cannabis open the car
Too busy shinin' my own star, only been making money
I dun' got used to your switchin', I need you hating on me
Aroma like the grower, you should'a' known your boy was colder Smoother days are closer, vow to make my new one doper
You just been a holster, now you makin' moves
You're supposed to cherish everything now
No guarantee to do it over
Pardon the view, I'm global, then go review the total
Top of my mo'fuckin' game and I ain't doin' promo
Photo's and I need every new fit, polo's a hobby
Killin' consistent, and you went forgot me

[Hook]
I waited for it all my life
Don't think about it, role the mother fuckin' dice
The price of sacrifice
Cause all the glitter's over-hyped
Nobody there tomorrow if it's all gone tonight
The doubtin' makes the battle right
I bet it all, they waitin' for you take your fall
Envy got an appetite
And I got a thing for heights
I'm gonna' come back and do it twice
