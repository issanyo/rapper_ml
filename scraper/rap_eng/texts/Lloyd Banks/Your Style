[Intro: Troy Ave]
See, now I went to the club and I ran into this girl
And she was telling bout how she feel and everything
Her name was New York
But she said, "Troy listen"

[Pre-Chorus: Troy Ave]
She said yo' new shit pumpin'; you make us so proud
We’ve been wantin something this good for a while
But I’m not fooled by both them dimples on yo' face
Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
She like my style; she like my flows
It ain’t no chuck involved; she knows
I came so far from dealin' blow
Been on my grind, and now it shows
Ain’t nobody 'round who sound like this
We ain’t the same; they rode that dick
Fuck them lames; get down with this
Pop Champagne; girl shake yo' hips

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Wife beater with the cake
She got the long hair - ain’t nothing fake
All blue thong with the stars on it
Layin' in my bed and she all on it
Rewind back, before I grind the cat
Two steppi'n in the club with my dogs all strapped
There for dough, playin' with the bitches
A flashy young nigga before we took the pictures
I can take ya number, can’t be ya man
But you can act like it in ya Instagram
I like flippin' grams and you like me
And if you into getting money, baby you like me
Come on, I’m out here; sound the alarm
I heard one good girl is worth a thousand whores
One good song is worth a thousand tours
So before I leave, proceed wit' yo' boy

[Pre-Chorus: Troy Ave]
She said yo' new shit pumpin'; you make us so proud
We’ve been wantin something this good for a while
But I’m not fooled by both them dimples on yo' face
Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
She like my style; she like my flows
It ain’t no chuck involved; she knows
I came so far from dealin' blow
Been on my grind, and now it shows
Ain’t nobody 'round who sound like this
We ain’t the same; they rode that dick
Fuck them lames; get down with this
Pop Champagne; girl shake yo' hips

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Shorty got a thing for me; it’s only right I slide with her
Spoil with money ice, and there was G’s there sayin'
Poppin' like I’m celebratin'; spend a week in the pane
Next two cities, I’m a sleep on the plane
One time for keeping it real
Still in yo' heart where you stay
Liftin' yo' feet up, like the marksman I aim to leave 'em
Sometimes for all these non-believers; now we even
I think your run is a public of line up out of the seasons
You’re beside me for a reason
Come check the breeze out with the flyest nigga breathing
Everything here is mine for keeping
I see you’re reaching
You want that vibe back
Bodies on my NY hat, gotta be in my Palm rap still
Catch a contact, chill
Gather yo mind back
We in from the gutter baby, hard to out shine that
New faces every morning, I recover
Feeling like we never knew each other

[Pre-Chorus: Troy Ave]
She said yo' new shit pumpin'; you make us so proud
We’ve been wantin something this good for a while
But I’m not fooled by both them dimples on yo' face
Cause when we danced, I felt that fifth all on yo waist
And you know

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
She like my style; she like my flows
It ain’t no chuck involved; she knows
I came so far from dealin' blow
Been on my grind, and now it shows
Ain’t nobody 'round who sound like this
We ain’t the same; they rode that dick
Fuck them lames; get down with this
Pop Champagne; girl shake yo' hips
