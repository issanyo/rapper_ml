[Intro]

See they ain't fooling nobody
I know they be talking the same ole' shit I be talking
See y’all won't let me do no shit like that
See I gotta put a little cursive in my shit or y’all won't even buy it
Do to the fact that therefore some people...

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I feel like I’m enough to go around
So I’m in and out them twins
In my big boy truck
Younger than the rims
I welcome the wealth but it come with sins
Niggas turn they backs on him
Now their stomachs thin
Pound, Yen stacks on ten
Whopper turned into the Macs With the Rach on him
My temper lost, figured I make it back off then
Look at the Cross exhaust of the Lac gold rim
I get it in
Shorty say she love the way my swaggers
And my lifestyle unlike the ordinary rapper
All this shit is really his
And he really got the cig
Next thing I knew I had both my titties round his dick (shiiiittt)
You know I beat her like a thief
White beamer by the beach
Wife beater and my sneaks
Non-belief is in grief
Silence your beef
You can have it anyway you want
Come violence or peace

[Bridge: (Lloyd Banks)]
Them same ones that be talking bout im dirty
Be buying my shit and hiding it
(P dot L dot K)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Microphone check one, two
Line a crew up
Give me a crew, I’ll run through
I ain’t a motherfucking ?
Kung-fu won't matter when that ratter go boom
Where I go the chatter go too
I’m part of the industry that I won’t do
Matter fact it’s washed up
Y’all can have it back, magnum wrapped
Yeah I’m stuck to the street, I rather that
Whips shittin' back to back
They need a shovel truck
Been doing my thing
Still sound like you coming up
Same state, different slut
Niggas complaining
You know I don’t give a fuck
You know I don’t lift a buck
Not even that ? sick when I bent
Rainman I make it shower like Kemp
Hit the casino with tall G’zz
And I be out by the palm trees while you wearing long sleeves

[Outro: (Lloyd Banks)]
I do not resent that I’ll take the sales anyway you wanna give them to me
(I'll see you at the top nigga)
But I thought it wasn’t fair to the people
(G-unit till I drop nigga)
(Two G’zz up)
(Southside)
(We in here)
(Or here)
