I've had it for the last time
You're actions got me hot as my last rhyme
You're options will either get put out greenwich or as fine
Fine just ain't gon cut it
Drama is what you're in love with
You're one of them bitches you run with
Lately I'm feeling smothered
(?) conceited with cover girl motives
I gotta rise above it
You think them models loving me
I'm thinking bout dozen, doesn't really matter what you say
Sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon be splitting, you don't think I mean it
Meant it, everything I got, fuck you
Ain't no secret no apologies you keep it
Now that I'm doing my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy who needs it
Every rumour you hear you go believe it
Point out the times you've seen it
You stabbed me should linked it
Revenge is mine, i need it, need a way out
It's my fucking life, let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought (?) ain't that easy
Bet you thought I need you a million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you
Ain't no freebies get your coat and go
The female pinnochio, money hungry, hopeless hoe
You fucking with my focus so
Go back to that trunk that played the role before
Love is like a cancer when you don't let go
I'mma blow fo 'sho
Unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I don't need you sinking us
I hope you float, lying through my teeth I hope you don't
(drown, drown)
Now the sound of every (?)
Bottles pop out while he smoke
Hit me pride that we broke
Let them girls crowding me go
If they got something to show
Let em show me how I love, I'm never lonely
Never even left a scar
You fell hard, I'm laughing
Ha ha ha ha ha
Tyre smoke fancy car
Nothing is what we are
No beginning no tomorrow
Cause I'm moving on, don't worry about me
Cause I'm gon be aight without you, you'll see
There ain't no-one on this Earth I'd much rather be cause God-dammit
I'm glad that I'm me
I said if you could be where I'm at (bye bye)
You'd wanna be you too
(I'm living without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you'd be in as good a mood as I am
But you don't so you just feel like you
I'm moving on, don't worry about me
Cause I'm gon be just fine without you, you'll see
There ain't no-one on this Earth right now I'd rmuch rather be
Cause God-dammit I'm glad that I'm me
I said if you could be where I'm at (bye bye)
You'd wanna be you too
(I'm living without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you'd be in as good a mood as I am
But you don't so you just feel like you
I said if you could be where I'm at (bye bye)
You'd wanna be you too
(I'm living without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you'd be in as good a mood as I am
But you don't so you just feel like you
...the relationship, ships sink
You know it's love as soon as you fall in it
Cause shit stinks
And it feels like every time I fucking do I get jinxed
Cupid must have put a curse on me
6 weeks went by and we only spoke twice
I'm sitting in your driveway calling you from the car
Suffice I think its safe to say your not at home
I'm calling your cell phone, you answer
But I can tell though you're not alone
How was I to know, it should have been time to go a long time ago
I kept holding on
Its comical when I think back now I couldn't get the hint
You feel the draft...
