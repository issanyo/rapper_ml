[Intro]
Yeah--Oh yeah!
You mothafuckas riding with me? Oh yeah
They know I got that iron with me. Oh yeah

[Hook]
This shit is for my block, my hood, my set, my city
The Kings, the Bloods, the Crips, they with me
The divas, the bitches, the dimes, The deuces
My set-a-nigga-up hoes, the strippers, the boosters
The snatchings, kidnappings, it happens
So often. The murders, the burglars
Be careful where your walkin'
The East, the West, the North, the South
Stay on point 'cause niggas will run up in your house

[Verse 1]
Boy ima 6 figga nigga doing what I gotta do
Wave cap, gray black, Maybach powder blue
Bitch go get my money--make daddy proud of you
Look at them bitches stand, they probably sour too
Bitch you know how we do, G4s, Bentley Coupes
Riding round town. Buck, Snoop, countin' up my loot
I'm from the Eastcoast but I be out west
Tank top, Cali bud, all day around breast
Give me a couple minutes I be all in they mind
And not just one or two, three or four at a time
I'll be all in her spine, if your daughter's a dime
Meet her at eight and I'll be gone by a quarter to nine

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 2]
Niggas be hatin' on me baby, so I keep a hot one
.44, .45, Mac-10 and shotgun
Get tha f**k out of here, or catch a hot one
You can stunt all you want, but not on my block son
See when the cops come, niggas sprint, hop, run
Get caught, don't talk, learn to keep a locked tongue
I'm from the southside, but I be up north
Disrespect me get your head blown the f**k off
Nigga's is butt soft, I don't pay 'em no mind
You Just another bitch with my name in your rhyme
You'll need your sunglasses on the way that I shine
You don't want me flaming that 9(mm)

[Hook]
