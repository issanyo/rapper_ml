[Hook]:
Anywhere it's going down, tell 'em we popping up
And we taking all these bitches popping bub
Then we taking all these bitches out the club
It's early in the morning and I'm tryna fuck

[Verse 1]:
Super booty game spitter, she popping, I'm ok with her
This ain't no mistake nigga
Big gold rings on eight fingers
Rue the truth, I'm ho proof
Mixtape Zeus, the big Jes√∫s
Twenty-Four hours of sex and sour, then my flows on a six day cruise
Getting better everyday, can't lose
Cool sweater, I'm a good thread fool
Hit em then I go, I'm rude, swimming in the dough like Scrooge
I Should of been a pilot bruh, should of been blew a long time ago
Now let's make these commas grow, my chick got that Saint Thomas glow
I lift her all weekend, Three black days in the bat cave
A few bad hoes that sing background, I menage they asses backstage
Catch a ride on my rap wave, surfs up, make my verse down
Mermaids on my days off, money made my first smile

[Hook]:
Anywhere it's going down, we popping up
And we taking all these bitches popping bub
Then we taking all these bitches out the club
It's early in the morning and I'm tryna fuck

[Bridge]:
Shawty, If you're boring then you got to go
Every night performing, now let's
Start the show
Twenty woman on me in my limousine
Telling me they want it
Cause I'm getting green

[Verse 2]:
Leader of the new school, I'm About My Bread Academy
Top notch hoes wanna marry me, my foes want my head on a cavalry
We out here living like savages, in a battlefield, no battery
I kick these sixteens sitting down, these lil niggas ain't half of me
Back in the same lane actually, my appetites on accolades
All these fat-ass silhouettes, I spot em through my mackin shades
All I take is good food trips, bitches call me Ruth's Chris
Dishes on my new wheels, pitches in my new fits
Damn sure ain't Three, Four, Five, so who's in your top Two miss?
I'm the one they biting from, I put that on my blue pits
Ain't no prob, I do this, number one spot on the cool list
Don't doubt me that's foolish, I burn down these computers, Uh!

[Hook]:
Anywhere it's going down, we popping up
And we taking all these bitches popping bub
Then we taking all these bitches out the club
It's early in the morning and I'm tryna fuck

[Bridge]:
Shawty, If you're boring then you got to go
Every night performing, now let's start the show
Twenty woman on me in my limousine
Telling me they want it cause I'm getting green
