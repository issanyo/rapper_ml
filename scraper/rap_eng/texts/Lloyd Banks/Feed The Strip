[Verse One]
Never going to be peace for the chosen
I'm hearing voices, let machine noise lure me to it
Don't like my choices, if I could I'd get ya
To see the picture, you're sinking quicker
You need me with ya, green chasing bikini ripper
Victims every week, mr prezi suite
Heavy desi heat, mixing in with cutthroat (?)
Guess I was losing it to think I'm special, street brought me back
I block the fuck out on the world again, shitting all through the map
Envy's killing happy, exactly why I walk alone
Inside the character from young, still in the man when you're grown
Home to the bravest living, no favoritism in this dangerous living
Niggas switch up every day, play your position
This is only for the culture, the kush will keep my shit on ultra
Helping the bums with hurling, like I'm supposed to
Close to rolling everybody over, feel like I'm coasting
Shooting the breeze in, you niggas stuck in slow motion

[Hook]
The streets'll take you any day, they don't love you
Young man, no plan, caught up in the struggle
Fuck 'em, they don't understand I ain't thinking of you
Keep your shit, it's so many ways to get the trouble
Feed The Strip
Today I'm cold as ever, revenge took a hold of me
And wants me do 'em better, problem of my era
Everybody chasing the peace, put it together

[Verse Two]
Yo, my mind hit millions on, it made me major, 80's neighbor
Make a deal with me in time, don't like me now, hate me later
You got a too shady nature, screwfacing ain't ya
I'm blue, raising paper, too much for all ya throw me a few names I break 'em
I know the BS wants my company
All these fake niggas amongst me
Lucky me to have support I guess, embrace that comfy
You got a destiny in hell, trey shells and LOLs
State bells, I'm international, that grind takes twelve
Designer lines, great shelves, a box of Dom ?
I sold for every one of us, slow down and humble yourself
I visioned triumph near, clips of bottle glear, this the tyrant, yeah
Fire stare, rip through riot gear, grip new iron here
Glowing out my writing chair, went all way out my mind first
I hope a traitor dies a thousand deaths and every times worse
I miss my people, time hurts, I see you smiling at my concerts
Still making niggas rewind, eye on the work

[Hook]
The streets'll take you any day, they don't love you
Young man, no plan, caught up in the struggle
Fuck 'em, they don't understand I ain't thinking of you
Keep your shit, it's so many ways to get the trouble
Feed The Strip
Today I'm cold as ever, revenge took a hold of me
And wants me do 'em better, problem of my era
Everybody's chasing the peace, put it together
