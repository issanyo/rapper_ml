[Intro: 50 Cent]
50. Believe me, it's easy. We number one effortlessly. This is the Unit

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Pussy nigga come around me movin'
I'll put a hollow through him (hollow through him)
I'll leave your body oozin'
I don't know who confused him (who confused him)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
From PR to DR, niggas know who we are
They know how we do it, it's the motherfucking Unit
Push the rock, move the yayo, stack paper like lego
Rap tornado, yeah, we fuck with Tego
He don't even speak Spanish, he a fraud
Joe really don't want drama, he a broad, see that cannon, oh Lord
That nigga get to talking to God
Like father forgive me for my sins and forgive me for my friends
If you give me one more chance I will not do this again
Why 50 never lose, man? He always wins
It's cause the block love us, you cocksucker
I got your number, this could be your last summer

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Pussy nigga come around me movin'
I'll put a hollow through him (hollow through him)
I'll leave your body oozin'
I don't know who confused him (who confused him)

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
Passport's stamped up, money mesmerizing
Tropic horizon, juicy socializing
Oochie girl coniving, but Gucci girl poppin'
Chloe bag, Chloe boots down to the stockings
I catch extras with extra toppings
Hunnid E-X, 50 dropped the top in
Ain't no stoppin, G-Unit poppin'
Audi R8, jake cannot stop him (break it down now)
Joe ain't poppin', Khaled ain't poppin'
Fans see them and they not stoppin '
Fans see me when I'm hurr mate shoppin'
Gucci shoppin', tags is poppin'

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Pussy nigga come around me movin'
I'll put a hollow through him (hollow through him)
I'll leave your body oozin'
I don't know who confused him (who confused him)

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
You could take your white flag and stick it, I'm different
Which means a nigga diss me we can't kick it
Matter of fact, a nigga diss me he diss himself
I'm papa, I'll whoop these niggas, pick a belt
A clown won't bump heads with me, Hulk Hogan bold
I'll crush you like bugs on a open road
Another sixteen bars, another overload
It's hot out, and none of my shoes are open toes
You see a lot of bling on stage, it's probably mine
I got four rings on me like the Audi sign
I take the elevator down, make the lobby shine
A nigga try to take what's mine, nigga, shotty time

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Pussy nigga come around me movin'
I'll put a hollow through him (hollow through him)
I'll leave your body oozin'
I don't know who confused him (who confused him)

[Outro: 50 Cent]
That nigga's a rat, son. You heard that nigga? He's like, "the truth won't come out". Donnie Brasco-ass nigga, man. You know who the fuck he is, man. He gonna be like, "yo, Macho! They got us, come out from behind the car. Come on, man, they got us". Niggas sweet, man. The fuck is these niggas from? They make the Bronx look bad
