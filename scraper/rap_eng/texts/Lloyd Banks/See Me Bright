[Verse 1]
Illest nigga doin it i gotta b em
If i could see em
BM parked outside tha colliseum
Collosal catalog
Carats 'll give u cataracts
Critic, i dont land in the category of average rap
Or average topic, i pop it
Damage is catastrophic
Boy u could never touch me
You think i had a hostage
You thinkin trophies
I break em
Im thinkn cash boxes
When u win, time flys
Platinum fast watches
I just... Broke out tha air wit my chest
I gotta get mine, ain't got no time
Ain't scared to go but not yet
I won't sweat
Leer jet take me everywhere in shorter time
Hustle so my daughter fine
Son thats happy all tha time
Execute enormous grind
The industry's my toilet bowl
Water flow
Dump a load of shit off at ya office yo
The wheel of fortune slow
Imma spin that bitch off
Bet my mansion imma get mine
My nigga get yours

[Hook]
Cross me, ya gettn high
Ya options are live or die
Close ya eyes, dont cry
I murder for my nigga I
Throw it in these niggas face
They don't wanna see me shine
I'mma make em see me bright
Frontin in that DB9
They gon give me all thats mine
Anything come less is crime
Fuck everything but tha dough
Im stronger than my second time
They tha type to go run
Shorty im tha wrecking kind
Balling till its all done
Bet they gon respect a don....
I handle all these niggas 1 at a time

[Verse 2]
Failure can only break u if ya blind to it
I rise above tha shit
Now watch me as i climb thro it
My lifes a struggle
And my minds music
My motto ain't no mystery
You topping mine, prove it
Hope i dont lose it
That'll mean mama raised a loser
And im a winner
Drugs for dinner
Haze abuser
And im tha ruler
I'll make ya bottom girl a chooser
She used to think u were cool
Too bad im cooler. (Ughh)
Two coupes, couple guns
Gucci buckle hun
Blow ya breath on these dice
Pray to god my number come
Where my opponents
My flow is colder than tha homeless
This microphone is
Only controlled with my aromas
I wish my foes comas
Buried upside down
Lets make em all donors
Hungry's how tha fuck i sound
You kissing butt, die now
Thats what tha pussies do
All my niggas angry
And it urks us just to look at u

[Hook]
Cross me, ya gettn high
Ya options are live or die
Close ya eyes, dont cry
I murder for my nigga I
Throw it in these niggas face
They dont wanna see me shine
Imma make em see me bright
Frontin in that DB9
They gon give me all thats mine
Anything come less is crime
Fuck everything but tha dough
Im stronger than my second time
They tha type to go run
Shorty im tha wrecking kind
Balling till its all done
Bet they gon respect a don....
I handle all these niggas 1 at a time

[Verse 3]
Real dont recognize real cuz i done made mistakes
Put my trust in these niggas
Let these cowards in my place
Smoked and shared laughs
Ate big dinners off my plates
Just to diss me on tha record
Now im shittin on they face (poop)
We're not at all alike
Banko from outer space duke
I even own a spaceship
Platinum wit a grain coupe
Trap me, pull it, aim, shoot
That'll get me madd juice
Yayo got tha whoppa
It spit longer than papoose
G-Unit nigga
Jamaica baby
Jet to tha jam
Jumpoff, jog to tha dressing room to get jumped
U send em all

[Hook]
Cross me, ya gettn high
Ya options are live or die
Close ya eyes, dont cry
I murder for my nigga I
Throw it in these niggas face
They dont wanna see me shine
Imma make em see me bright
Frontin in that DB9
They gon give me all thats mine
Anything come less is crime
Fuck everything but tha dough
Im stronger than my second time
They tha type to go run
Shorty im tha wrecking kind
Balling till its all done
Bet they gon respect a don....
I handle all these niggas 1 at a time
