[Lloyd Banks]
Guess who's back, motherfucker, G U-N-I-T
There's a lot of looming that's comin' blow all of them enemies
The top gunner, the boy wonder, [?]

You niggas heard of what I keep on my wrists
This rap shit made me lazy, I smoke a blunt, get some head
Fall asleep on a bitch, you can back your [?]
I'm number one in the drafts, just ask, you lookin' at the rap LeBron James
I'm like a breath of fresh air, a hope for the future
[We got land?] So I be lookin' at the scope when I shoot ya
There's a couple niggas emulatin' me but they both clones
My air reigns reflect more cars than smoke cones
Smoke cones? Or make a resum√©, stop wastin' your time makin' them records the radio'll never play
I give them my speakers, green, blue, red, grey
Then buy a couple cones, sing, do never say
I laugh when I see your sales, Yayo got a bigger buzz than you on the streets, and he in jail
The room's full of females, waitin' they verse to go hatch
I fuck my bitch with a condom and a birth control patch
