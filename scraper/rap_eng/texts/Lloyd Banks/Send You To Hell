[50 cent]
Yea man niggas know what it is man niggas know there ain't nothing better than this right here man G-Unit man, fuck is the matter with these niggas man

[Hook]
We from the the bottom
We done came up but the money ain't change us
You trying to come up how the fuck can you blame us
Niggas tryin to front so I walk with a stainless
Motherfuckers I'll send you to hell

[Loyd Banks]
I'm flying out the country ain't no tellin when I'm gonna be back
To be honest half these artist never gonna see that
I keep my bad habits away from where I'm gonna eat at
Before I sit up for a bitch I'll lose one knee cap
I paid a visit to father time but he flung me back
Shot to these reasonable one's with the guns we pack
Live for the dollar and grateful for every one we stack
Mind of a man with no sleep my dogs run feedback
Don't scheme at the rocks on hand before your mama sees us
Seed in the bag like a popcorn man
The one's we pack is not gonna jam
If we squeeze of the block go scram
Boiled eggs is all I had damn
A replica of my senior cause you'll remember me
My grandfather still smoking weed and he's 70
My blood rushing of this Hennessy
Walking out the door with a felony
Check check out my melody
Nigga
