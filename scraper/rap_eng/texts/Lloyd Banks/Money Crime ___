[Verse 1]
Cheffin' up continuous, rapper raps in my melting pot
Injuries consecutive, snappin' necks 'cause I'm felt a lot
Mix me in with the great names, weirdo ones on the shelf to rot
Bread in a box is hot when no card swaps, we were dealt the block
I'm rollin'
This emcee's chosen, your end piece open
Always cookin', look at the Ben's he's smokin'
Cement me topin'
Broken from foul disappointments since youth
Our only choice is fixed truth
Listen, my voice will hit roofs, record in a bulletproof booth
Birds in your movement soon as you pull a few coupes
Turn to snotty, your stuck-up, tight as group loose
A shotty to your deuce deuce
Back on my worst behavior, the don who raised ya
Hopin' a legend takes a shot at me, bet my response is greater
Somebody quote me, I'll be back for the trophy, beyond creative
None of them really how they making it seem, peons persuasive
Bet on your life you witnessed something this cool, freons and tanks
If I get to blackin', foul reaction
You're boring really, the crowds relaxin'

[Chorus]
Counted a nigga out, but you fucked up and got a survivor
It takes a check to go to war, let's take it dollar for dollar
We strategize with discipline, won’t break the mind of a rider
Giant in the game of little niggas, watch me fucking tower
Money, crime and sex, time to stretch on a private jet
Hundred thousand neck, hail the vets, give me my respect
Stumbling out the 'jects, headed to the top's what I expect
Put that on the set, stomp competition for rep

[Verse 2]
Here’s your overdose of reality
The ghetto made me sharp, carved my anatomy
Gem star to your writing arm, what a tragedy
Stronger I get to break from these demons
Harder they grabbin' me
Battlin' with the powers that be, bomb in a traffic free
Terrorize your rap entry, sing along with catastrophe
Niggas never been half of me, I split apart they lackin' G
Hoopties out of my fucking lane
Wanted timer designer his buckle frames
Not many can hang, maybe a couple names
Pencil me married to clarity, check my knuckle game
Bars climb through hard times, coming in clutch, my crutch is pain
Cancerous critics done tampered with it, no fucks remain
Fuck 'em all with a passion, I’m classic, CD deluxe and frame
I’m living
My flow is like a S6 with the kit in
World in my palms, two decades too long, juggling women
Got stones jumpin' in rhythm
Ice package, my wrist rocky
Spotlight in my ear, qiang hittin' like Big Papi

[Chorus]
Counted a nigga out, but you fucked up and got a survivor
It takes a check to go to war, let's take it dollar for dollar
We strategize with discipline, won’t break the mind of a rider
Giant in the game of little niggas, watch me fucking tower
Money, crime and sex, time to stretch on a private jet
Hundred thousand neck, hail the vets, give me my respect
Stumbling out the 'jects, headed to the top's what I expect
Put that on the set, stomp competition for rep
