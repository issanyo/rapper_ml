Uh-huh! Haha! {Whoooooooooooooo Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid! }
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire 'cause Shady said so! (HERE WE GO!) {WHAT? }
I'm on fire!
Everybody's
In a rush try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone (RIGHT!)
I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me - I'm better off jus' left alone
And I ain't even tryna go there with' record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself. (YEAH!)
Say: "What up? " - Keep steppin', and just rap D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail {HAHA! }
And livin' wreckless. - But if you go check my belt
You may see something else I used to protect myself (YEAH!)
A Vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you {Whoooooooo! }
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line (UH-HUH!)
But this motherf*cker Ja musta lost his mind. (WOOOO!)
That X! - Got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? - X, Luther, 'Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' the same song, RECYCLED!
We'd all much rather get along and fight you
Me and Hailie danced to your songs - we liked you!
And you don't really wanna step inside no Mic booth (UH-HUH!)
C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to - with syllable after
Syllable I just slap ya
Killin' you fasta
Than you poppin' pill afta little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on! - But if you want it you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with' any motherf*cker that wants to! (WHOOOO!)
So what's the, deal where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like: "Ja what up dawg? "
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with' all your men - we coulda solved this then. (OOOH!)
I'm a grown man dawg come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be. - Come on!
I - know - you don't want it with me
You - know - you don't want it with me. (YOU DON'T WANT IT WITH ME!)
