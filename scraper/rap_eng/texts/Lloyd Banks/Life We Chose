[Verse 1: Havoc]
Got these cowards out plotting on me, red dotting for me
Blast 'em with the clapper, know I keep the ratchet on me
All that beefing shit is corny, nigga, faker than the Twitter beef
Your girl wants something realer so she's in my sheets
And I don't blame her, she rather be around this paper
Every move made is major, fuck a crib we buying acres
ODing off of life is where the high can take us
Sky's the limit, up above and way beyond you haters
I'm coming at your head better duck
Out from under bushes like, "surprise, remember us?"
My music is the most ominous shit you'll ever bump
Niggas wanna meet their maker I'm just here to hook it up
And when you get there just be sure to send him my regards
Lord forgive me for this shit these niggas got me on
I'm trying hard, so very hard
I pull you into beef that you can never squash

[Hook x2: Havoc]
This the life we chose, dealing with the life we chose
It's a cold world homie and it's only getting colder
Motherfuckers get their whole life froze

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
This ghetto giving out scars, we'll run the world in a year
I only figured out a plan and switched it, life sucked
Felt like I was tortured, every day we had to climb through the dirt
Hell if I forfeit
Been around the world and back again, nigga, check out the portrait
No more selling me short shit, my will so strong
For my soul, if you came across it, time to reclaim my fortune
Big fleet, line up the horses, gotta stay on my feet
Fuck running, down with the fortress, M-O-B 'til I sleep, nigga
South Jamaica is my drive, watch your fucking own back
That's what it takes to stay alive
If fiends wild, I've got the crystal shiny with me now
A thousand and more styles, mine's like a clip of rounds
Watch for the shifty smiles, just push the bar higher
Done lifted the crowd
Building on tilt, fill up this bitch with loud
A temper on me and that click-and-pow
Holding on to all these memories
I've got to think about them just to smile

[Hook x4]
