Oh oh oh
This for all that niggas
Who is livin the slaughter life
Passin crack in the corners
Runnin of the cops everyday
Winnin a few Gs
But you still want to live that

Oh lets start this shit...
Everyday in the cornah
With only 15 years oldah
Passin crack
Until the late night
Cops walkin and seen me all the time
But what i can do?
Is what a street fool can do
Fuck the school
I want yo break all the ruls
Cops runnin and screamin: Stop that fool!

Im tellin you what i was doing
Now you see me chillin with an uzi
Everynight eatin pussys
Doing my duddys
Watches   from Gucci
Known like Luci
Yeah cuz ima Demon
Named Cimeries rollin in rhynos
Fuckin bitches with the same body like Bambino
I can do it cuz ima fino

Is the Black Panther
I was passin crack for masters
Now you see me in crips fuckin bitches very faster
Im not a liar
Ask about me on the calles
And they going to say dont fuck with that kaze
Niggas who rather
To fuck with the Panther
But i dont matter
I kill em with the 9
While im drinking wine
I dont have time
So start to shoot and also to cry
And the Prince will fuck you up
Yao!

Is what the underground bringing
And this is only the begining
Why are you thinkin you can be a B.G?
Fuckin kittie
You are talkin with a Genius
The mentality of a meaness
Is rhymin very cleaness
And sickness
Now im hanging with ritches
Fuckin bitches
My rhymes will be clitches
Ending business
Transformin in a killest
The way of an Ugliest
Money hungriest
Now ima success
My arm with a Rolex
A lot of knowledge
Buenas Noches
I can see your family in coches
The Panther does nt have roches
Better run and dont fuck with this monster
