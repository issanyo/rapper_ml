[Verse: 6ix9ine]
Hit you with the Trey, bitch
Gang, bitch, gon' spray shit
I spray shit, don't say shit
My main bitch you can't be
No, don't stop, make the poles cap
I be on the block with the whole ave
Sayin' shit, but it don't matter
And this big phat on my wrist, bladder
I got the gun with the beam on it
Shoulda sold out, had to leave on it
Scum in the cut, put the team on it
Shorty in the cut, had to team on it

Apeshit! Apeshit! Apeshit!
Apeshit! Apeshit! Apeshit!
Apeshit! Apeshit! Apeshit!
Apeshit! Apeshit! Apeshit!
Apeshit! Apeshit! Apeshit!

Ape, ape, ape, ape (let's go)
Ape, ape, ape, ape (let's go)
Ape, ape, ape, ape (let's go!)
