[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Niggas ain't scum
Four fifth through the drum
You only got that for fun
All of that fronting for what?
I might pull up in a Lamb
Run up on your mans
Pop a nigga like a Xan
When I run up with my clan
Niggas know me, 4 5 6, stay it
Aim at your motherfucking fitted
Nigga, we with it
30 cli in the smith
Knock the nigga off his pivot
Watch your eyes fake the dump
When this gun fucking buck
Concrete shoes and all
Body lay under the tongue
Yeah, we rep that fucking six
But I finger fuck that nine
They throw dirt all on my name
Spell TEKASHI69
Went to jail, spent the case
Nigga, I ain't doing time
Feel whole weight, in my set
We held 30, free the 9 (squad)

[Hook: 6ix9ine]
Niggas don't want no smoke
See them, they choke
Buck 50 through his nose
Then I take a nigga bitch
Head to the trap, all my niggas giving gold
All my niggas trained to go
Upping the pole, TTG, we let it go
Whack a nigga like a mole
40 CAL through his soul
Then we hit the road

[Verse 2: Hudson Flo]
You don't really want no smoke
You don't really got no hope
Boy, you know I got that pole
Everyday and I know
Everyday it's a go
You don't really want no war
Better double lock your door
When you come knock with force
Knocking you off your horse
Then run out and hop the porch
Won't peep no more
.38 baby, .38 raised me
But I won't let my .38 change me
Gotta come up, won't sleep 'till I make it
Gotta get out, I'm stuck in the Matrix
It's time I change up your thought
Better think fast, I'm aiming the torch
Ain't taking a loss, I'm making a cross
I'm taking it all, so take it no more
The way I move like Mike in his prime
Rise up and I'm taking what's mine
I move to the left, I move to the right
I step back and I shoot out your light
And thank you for days and thank you for weeks
Thinking it's sweet, I'll shoot up your street
Been praying a lot, but I don't really know if I'm praying to God
But the praying don't stop
Don't have dreams, I have nightmares
Said I don't sleep, so I won't leave
I pull it out, I don't fight fair
Said I won't leave, so bitch hold these
