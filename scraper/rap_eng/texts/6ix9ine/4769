[Intro: Dirty Sanchez]
I need a bitch that's dirty like me, dirty like me
I need a bitch that's dirty like me, dirty like me
I need a bitch that's dirty like me, dirty like me
I said I need a bitch that's dirty like me, me
Scum

[Verse 1: Dirty Sanchez]
Got a couple niggas that'll kill a couple niggas
Really wanna try, really catch him in the ceiling
Getting high with your bitch, plotting on a milli'
47 reptilian, reptilian
For my nigga winners, or my nigga hundreds
All my niggas hundreds in the winter while they winning
Like Ken, nigga, no days off
I'll give you a verse, but I'll have to charge
Hand me the ball, ain't no king of discord
Living off beginning, now I made it to sport
Nigga bitch at the airport, leave your demons at the door
Homie, if not, I'ma send my homie Saw
Brand new hole up a in this bitch
Brand new zone up a in this bitch
I call the doors on in the corner, the cut
And get an ush, and a weed, no angel dust
I been ashing on angels, ain't no one above us
Ain't no nigga that I trust, ain't gettin' me fucked up
Bitches wanna fuck, yeah, yeah, go nuts
So tell me what my game, why these bitches love us
47 lifestyle, Scum Gang 69
Young niggas hella fly
Young niggas trap or die

[Pre-Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I need a dirty, dirty hoe in this motherfucker
I need a dirty, dirty hoe in this motherfucker
I need a dirty, dirty hoe in this motherfucker
'Cause I'm a dirty fuckin' Scum in this motherfucker

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me
Scum like me, Scum like me, Scum like me, Scum like me
Dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me
Scum like me, Scum like me, dirty, fuckin', Scum, bitch!

[Verse 2: JAB]
Dirty bitch that speaks it, Victoria Secret of pink fresh
King Slut plus incense, yo' pussy tingling, sixth sense
Scratching my back, left imprints
She fired up like my engines
Give me head in the whip, I don't need no tints
Sleep in my crib, better pay that rent
Super head, leave me in nasty, smack 'em, they nasty
Voice is raspy after what it done been through
Dirty sandwich is into sex on the beach
Sparking the light of the candle
We both just bust our nuts
And synchronize, 47 and 69
Screamin'

[Pre-Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I need a dirty, dirty hoe in this motherfucker
I need a dirty, dirty hoe in this motherfucker
I need a dirty, dirty hoe in this motherfucker
'Cause I'm a dirty fuckin' Scum in this motherfucker

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me
Scum like me, Scum like me, Scum like me, Scum like me
Dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me
Scum like me, Scum like me, dirty, fuckin', Scum, bitch!

[Verse 3: 6ix9ine]
Now go and pop that pussy for a Scum nigga
Off a perc, puffing on a blunt, drinking dumb liquor
Bust it open, bring it back, eat her with my golds in
Grab her ass, she kiss my neck, damn her pussy soakin'
You know I'm that nigga, hoe, fuck them other niggas, hoe
Other niggas chasing bitches, Wallah only chasing dough
Bitch ass, you gon' suck dick
She say "yeah, yeah, heard that before"
Big chains when my frost shine
She say "yeah, yeah, heard that before"
Flexing to these bitches, got 'em in they feelings
If she tell me I ain't hitting, then we never chilling
Flexing to these bitches, got 'em in they feelings
I bust a nut up in the ass, told her want my children! (Squad)

[Pre-Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I need a dirty, dirty hoe in this motherfucker
I need a dirty, dirty hoe in this motherfucker
I need a dirty, dirty hoe in this motherfucker
'Cause I'm a dirty fuckin' Scum in this motherfucker

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me
Scum like me, Scum like me, Scum like me, Scum like me
Dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me, dirty like me
Scum like me, Scum like me, dirty, fuckin', Scum, bitch!
