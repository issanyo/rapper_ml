[Intro: 6ix9ine]
Sticksonthebeat
Got me, got me a Rolex
(You can't even afford that)
Got me, got it, oh
(Take off your headphones)
Got it, got it, uh
(Shit, you know)
Got it, got it, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Came up blood gang, 30 bang
Scum Gang, big choppa, big thang
Let your nuts hang
Who they? Don't say
BBA change your mood, aye, anyday
Got it, got it, cookin' up, speed it up
Double cup, Xanny cup, booted up
Mollied up, molly up, break it up
Cop it, then I serve it up, get it up
Got it, got it

[Verse: PACkmaN]
Count it and I count it, then I bring it right back
I was just getting money, posted in the trap
Told my nigga, had to go and cop a new whip
I went in, had to drop the top on my shit
Bought me a Benz, that's a new MayBach, eh
I was getting money, now it’s time for payback
All you niggas hating, I was on the come-up
I had to get the bands, had to run them shits up
And now I’m doing good, now I made it out the hood
Everything I roll up is only Backwoods
Only OG, man, I’m smoking out the pound
I keep a lot of work, enough to make your city drown
(They call me PACk!)

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Came up blood gang, 30 bang
Scum Gang, big choppa, big thang
Let your nuts hang
Who they? Don't say
BBA change your mood, aye, anyday
Got it, got it, cookin' up, speed it up
Double cup, Xanny cup, booted up
Mollied up, molly up, break it up
Cop it, then I serve it up, get it up
Got it, got it

[Outro: 6ix9ine]
Got it, got it
Ayy, ayy
Got it, got it
Ayy
Billy that, Billy up, Billy that, Billy Up, Billy niggas
Got it, got it
Ayy, ayy
