[Intro: Trippie Redd]
Ayy, Big 14 bitch
Yuh, ayy
Woah, saucin', yeaaah, aight
Huh, ayy

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
1400, bitch, you know I tote a pole
With 6ix9ine, bitch, you know we tote them poles
Tote a pole, tote a pole, tote a pole
You talk down, we gon' let that shit go (grrat!)
Let it blow, let it blow, let it blow
Got the scope, got the scope, got the scope
.223's and I put 'em to your nose (to your nose)
Let it go, bitch, we let that shit go

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, and send shots off at your dome (At your dome bitch)
Pussy boy, we'll pull up at your home (At your home)
You're home alone, home alone, home alone
Hit your chromosome, bitch, chromosome, uh
Balling White Iverson, talking Post Malone
Haha, yeah, 14, yeah, 14, yeah, aye, uh
Tote a pole, tote a pole, tote a pole
Let it go, let it go, let it go
(Tote a pole, ah! Woo-woo!)

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine & Trippie Redd]
I'm toting big shit (Big shit)
Get your wig split (Wig split, yeah)
.45, call that the big bitch (Big stick)
We don't miss shit (Miss shit)
Get your ribs hit (Ribs hit)
Hollow tips, hit you with a crosshair (Yeah)
Drum on the gun, that's a pump with a red beam
Catch him in the bed, while he sleep, that's a wet dream
(That's a wet dream, haha)
Nigga try to test me
Close range headshots, fuck where the vest be
If a nigga try to test me, I off him (Off him)
Put a hole in his head, he a dolphin (You a dolphin)
Pull up on a nigga, you donâ€™t want it (That's that duppy shit)
Pull up with the Glocks, you won't want it (brrrah!)
I'll leave a nigga flat, no warning
Scum Gang, bitch, we on it, you don't want it (ooh, ooh)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
1400, bitch, you know I tote a pole
With 6ix9ine, bitch, you know we tote them poles
Tote a pole, tote a pole, tote a pole
You talk down, we gon' let that shit go (grrrat!)
Let it blow, let it blow, let it blow (let that bitch go)
Got the scope, got the scope, got the scope
.223's and I put 'em to your nose (to your nose)
Let it go, bitch, we let that shit go
