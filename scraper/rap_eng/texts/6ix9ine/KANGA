[Intro]
M-M-M-Murda

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
She want me, I ain't want her, ooh
She want me to be her boo
You so silly, don't get it confused
Now turn around, drop it low, pick it up, ooh
Big bank, we gettin' paid over here
Broke niggas, go stand over there
Fake ass hoes, go meet 'em over there
Little booties, they matter over here
Now stop

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Wait a minute, now I'm back at it
Back at it like a mothafuckin' crack addict
Sex addict, I'm a mothafuckin' sex addict
Hit shorty from the back, got her back crackin'
Back crackin', b-back crackin'
I love ho bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
Yeah, I like to fuck hoes, I got a fuckin' problem
Bang, bang, bang and a chicken wing, bitch
Yeah, I know you love how I put it down, bitch
Drop down and pick your weave up, girl
Drop down and get your Eagle on, girl
Head downtown and pick the eaters up, girl
You know them chicken-heads eat it up, girl

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
She want me, I ain't want her, ooh
She want me to be her boo
You so silly, don't get it confused
Now turn around, drop it low, pick it up, ooh
Big bank, we gettin' paid over here
Broke niggas, go stand over there
Fake ass hoes, go meet 'em over there
Little booties, they matter over here

[Verse 2: Kanye West, 6ix9ine]
That pussy get wetter than yours
That head is better than yours
I flew her out so I could fuck on tour
Flew her back 'cause my girlfriend saw her
They tried to say I wasn't black no more
About as black as Macklemore
They don't like me 'cause I'm Mexican
Sent me back, now I'm back again
Uh, just bought a piece of Fashion Nova
Your girlfriend look like a ogre
Nigga, fat bitches need love too
My fault, Ye, I wasn't sober
Who the fuck gon' listen to Ebro? (Ebro)
All these niggas so emo
Fuck that nigga, I'm the mothafuckin' shit
Another old nigga on a young nigga dick
N-N-Niggas tried to say that I was canceled (Canceled)
When I asked them questions, couldn't answer
How Ye? How Ye? How, Sway? Nigga it's fucking-

[Interlude: TrifeDrew]
Yo, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, woah, woah, woah
You cannot say that, bro, c'mon

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
She want me, I ain't want her, ooh
She want me to be her boo
You so silly, don't get it confused
Now turn around, drop it low, pick it up, ooh
Big bank, we gettin' paid over here
Broke niggas, go stand over there
Fake ass hoes, go meet 'em over there
Little booties, they matter over here
Now stop
