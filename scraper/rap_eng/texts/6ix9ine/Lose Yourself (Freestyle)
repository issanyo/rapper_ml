[Intro: Shotti3]
Aw, shit
Nah, don't do this shit, blood, don't do it to him
You sure you want to do some shit like this?
Now nigga, you know you going to get burnt or something
Bro, you can't do it, you can't do it
Just let it go
Ah shit, snap

[Verse: 6ix9ine]
You thought right when you ain't diss me
I'm a lyrical legend, I know they miss me
All you mumble rap kids, colorful hair
Can't compare to the lyrical phenomenon that's right here
Mars, Jupiter, Venus, origins and oranges combine: solar eclipse
Your mind is a eclipse of the origin, then, I, hah
