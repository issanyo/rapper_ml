[Intro: 6ix9ine]
Niggas iffy, uh, Blicky got the stiffy, uh
Got the blicky, uh, drum, it holds fifty, uh
Scum Gang!

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Pop these niggas like a wheelie, nigga, you a silly nigga
In the hood with them billy niggas and them Hoover niggas
You run up and they shootin' niggas, we ain't hoopin', nigga
Yo KB, you a loser, nigga, up that Uzi, nigga
On the stoop, crills in my drawers, your girl on my phone
She wanna fuck, but keep her clothes on, I only want the jaw
Man that's really all I use her for as I kick her out the door
I don't want her, you can keep the whore, she fiendin' for some more
In New York my niggas don't Milly Rock, my niggas money bop
Blow a case, a nigga throwin' shots, I run 'em off they block
Quarter milli in the stash box, I grinded for my spot
Niggas talkin' 'bout that cash but my bag worth alot
I don't fuck with no old hoes, only new hoes
Put my dick in her backbone, I pass her to my bro
I don't love her, that's a sad ho, she a bad ho
I'ma fuck her, then I dash home, to the cash ho

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that niggas bitch (Offset)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Diamonds hittin' (hittin'), when a boss talk, bitch, listen, huh (hey, hey)
We get yo' biscuit, huh (biscuits), I sic all my dogs, they vicious, huh (grr)
Fuck these bitches, huh, had to run out the bag in the kitchen, huh
My nigga on stick shift (stick shift), get Earl off nigga on some real shit, huh
Blow up the NAWF (NAWF), it's all in the jaw (it's all in the jaw)
Let me see my opp, ooh, 30 on my Glock
Plug 'em like a sock, trap out the pot (trap out)
Carbon grip the cartridge (car, brr), trap whip the marks (hey)
My rock a milli (milli), I take care a village (village)
My bitch the realest (realest), Wraith cost half a mili (Wraith)
Hermes belt lizard (lizard), my bitch blooded like Clifford
Lambo speed shiftin' (Lambo), get shot in your back like Ricky (bah)
Glock .40 give you a hickey, smokin' on cook like a hippy
She smoke on the dope on a visit, we haul it up first then we blitzin' (blitz)
R.I.P. to Pistol (Pistol), get whacked off when I whistle
You got caught down back, you a victim
Niggas ain't showin' no sympathy
Better think twice before you start dissin' me

[Verse 3: 6ix9ine]
Niggas iffy, uh, Blicky got the stiffy, uh
Got the blicky, uh, drum it holds fifty, uh
Move milli', all my niggas on fifty, uh
Talk down, pew pew pew, you silly, uh
Hit a stain, fifty bands, all hunnids
Spinning through ya block like a pop shove-it
Shoot at me I'm shooting back, I'm getting buckets
I ain't wanna take his life but nigga, fuck it

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch
I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch

[Outro]
Scum Gang!
