[Chorus: 6ix9ine & Hudson Flo]
I'm breaking it down (Stupid!)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (Yeah)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold (You fucking dummy)
You know we ain't making a sound (What)
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow (Blaow!) I'm making it blaow (Nlaow!)
I'm breaking it down (What)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (What)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold
You know we ain't making a sound (Big stupid)
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow (Blaow!) I'm making it blaow (Blaow, what?)

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Wish I could bring Pun back, blaow, nigga, run that
'Til they let Rowdy out, we gon' let these semis out
Wish I could bring Stacks back, Chad, let the MAC clap
'Til they free Biggavel, gotta give you niggas hell
Blicky make the nigga yell, beam hit his knees
Made him scream, when that nigga fell, shootout with the law
Or the morgue 'fore I sit in jail, niggas say they love me
I can see it in these niggas eyes, they don't wish me well
I don't need their company, they smilin' when a nigga fell
Seein' that I'm poppin', then the shotgun, like the third round
Order stitches for these snitches, dead men tell no tales
Diggin' ditches for these niggas, toss 'em in, so well
Drive-by, leave him in the street, nigga, road kill
HBA, gold fronts, let me guess, "So trill"?
Nigga, this is New York, make the wrong move
And the goons let the tool spark, work hard and move salt
8 Ball like pool holes, cracked like the pavement
Diesel like the gas station, trap out the basement
Blow in the Pyrex, mask on our faces
Let 'em act sketch, but this lead will erase 'em, on gang

[Chorus: 6ix9ine & Hudson Flo]
I'm breaking it down (Stupid!)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (Yeah)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold (You fucking dummy)
You know we ain't making a sound (What)
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow (Blaow!) I'm making it blaow (Nlaow!)
I'm breaking it down (What)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (What)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold
You know we ain't making a sound (Big stupid)
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow (Blaow!) I'm making it blaow (Blaow, what?)

[Verse 2: Hudson Flo]
Creeping through the darkness
Better think smart, kid
I'm finna spark shit
I'm creeping through the darkness
Like a demon inside of a mosh pit (what?)
I could never go back, I'm too deep in
Tweaking, solo marine
Put a bullet to your pillow, you sleep
Security breach, paranoid fingers get bleached (yeah)
Nightmares, I'm not dreaming, I feel like a demon
These motherfucking think I'm cold
I just sit back, light up a backwood
But that's after I run up and kick in your door
It's a go, I don't have a choice, compelled to
The struggling pain, yeah that's what they made
Now let me show what I'm propelled to
Satan said sorry, we even withheld you
Had to link up with 6ix9ine
Heard a voice speak from a dump room
Said "6ix9ine" about six times
Then the candle went out and the horror went through

[Chorus: 6ix9ine & Hudson Flo]
I'm breaking it down (Stupid!)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (Yeah)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold (You fucking dummy)
You know we ain't making a sound (What)
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow (Blaow!) I'm making it blaow (Nlaow!)
I'm breaking it down (What)
A scam, I heard that boy running around with the packs
So I'm taking him down (What)
Oh my gosh, they live by the cold
You know we ain't making a sound (Big stupid)
You thinking about playing around with my respect
I'm making it blaow (Blaow!) I'm making it blaow (Blaow, what?)
