[Verse 1: Supa Wave]
Bitch I came to shine, got it out the sky
Hoppin' out the ride, bitches sniffin' Calvin Klein
Taking ninety nine, on that nine-trey's line
Yeah I'm with my slime, niggas Billy crime
They gon' kill you over rhymes, I'ma smack you out your mind

[Chorus: Supa Wave]
It's the Scum, nigga, fuck it, it's the Wave, nigga (Scum!)
It's the Scum, nigga, fuck it, it's the Wave, nigga (Scum!)
Scum, nigga, Scum, nigga, Scum, nigga
Wave, nigga (ice), Wave, nigga, Wave nigga (TR3Y!)

[Verse 2: Supa Wave]
It's the Scum, nigga, fuck it, it's the wave
Put the K to your brain, let it bang
40 cal, 50 cal, we gon' pull up with them thangs
Ain't no aiming for no legs, they gon' make your life change
And truth be finessing, fuck where you stressing
Reaching for the weapon, for teaching them a lesson
Preacher for the pleasant, leave him in the stretcher
For fiction, I'm fixin' I'm really 'bout action
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)
Fifth on his lip, give him carmax and wax (woo, yuh!)
6ix9ine is the funk if he ask me to blast

[Verse 3: 6ix9ine]
Pump to his chest, 40 in the TEC, run up, leave him wet
His bitch gave me neck, sipping on that Tech
Keep that chrome on my side, split his head wide
On that type of time, niggas down to ride, I ain't gotta lie
You would think your bitch love me, way she calling my phone
She keep blowing up my shit, I told her "Leave me alone"
This bitch wanted me to fuck, I only wanted the dome
Heard there's niggas talking shit, but they don't want no smoke
When I get that fucking mop, it's a different approach
Niggas think that they a giant, but they really a roach
Niggas choke, when it blow, big pole, with a scope
No reload, watch him fall, 40 blow him down the road, gang
