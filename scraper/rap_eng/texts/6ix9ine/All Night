[Hook: Schlosser]
I'm alright (-right), go all night (night)
Robitussin got my head feeling so light (light)
You ain't tryna fight (fight), Luger press tight (tight)
Catch an opp, that's a dead man on sight (sight)
I'm alright (-right), go all night (night)
Robitussin got my head feeling so light (light)
You ain't tryna fight (fight), Luger press tight (tight)
Catch an opp, that's a dead man on sight (sight)

[Verse: Schlosser]
This rapping shit, I do it easy like a free-throw
He said he know it's fashion, what the fuck do he know?
I'm the fucking man (I'm the man), I got lots of bitches (aye)
When she saw my grills (aye), that bitch started strippin' (aye)
I ain't talking 'bout no shit that I ain't even living (woo)
But if a nigga talk shit, I'll hit him with the Smith then
I do him dirty (buck, buck, buck)
I never gave a fuck (buck, buck, buck)
He should've kept his mouth closed, now he lost his tongue
Blam, blam, blam, yeah, and I'm still fucking doing drugs
All the bad bitches go on show me love (aye)
Yeah, I'm still fucking doing drugs
All the fuckin' bad bitches go and show me love
