[Chorus]
I'll be on the block on the regular
With my niggas bustin' at the cops, on the regular
Bitches suckin' dick, givin' top, on the regular
Catch me water whippin' straight drop, on the regular
Yeah you know I run up with the shit on the regular
Bare-faced, I'ma hit a lick, on the regular
Posted with the drop, gun cocked, on the regular
Yeah I'm 6ix9ine with the nine, on the regular

[Verse]
Niggas want war, yeah, kick the door, yeah
Run up, break your jaw, yeah, get it on, yeah
I'ma hit a stain, yeah, broad day, yeah
Niggas act fake, yeah, catch a fade, yeah
Niggas said I changed, yeah, made some changes, yeah
I could never change, yeah, stay the same, yeah
I'm still in the hood, yeah, busting juggs, yeah
Puffing on a Wood, yeah, smoking good, yeah
Shorty want a pic, yeah, that ain't shit, yeah
Told her do a trick, yeah, on the dick, yeah
Bust her whole shit, yeah, in her ribs, yeah
Leave her with my kids, yeah, on her lips, yeah
Skrrt off in the Benz, yeah, doing tricks, yeah
Two hundred on the dash, yeah, tell the cashier
They want me, I don't lack, yeah, got my gat, yeah
Talk hot on getting whacked, yeah, body bag, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll be on the block on the regular
With my niggas bustin' at the cops, on the regular
Bitches suckin' dick, givin' top, on the regular
Catch me water whippin' straight drop, on the regular
Yeah you know I run up with the shit on the regular
Bare-faced, I'ma hit a lick, on the regular
Posted with the drop, gun cocked, on the regular
Yeah I'm 6ix9ine with the nine, on the regular
