[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Rocket, where these niggas at? I'm in the V with the tints
Got the FN on my body and the clip full of hollow tips
Niggas say they gon' rob me and they still ain't do shit
Catch him slipping in a lobby, leave his body in the ditch, boy
I'm in the west, boy, Rocket got the TEC, boy
Them other mop niggas, leave them niggas wet, boy
One day I'll bang 'em, that Glock'll rearrange ya
That stainless, I say no, go around and get your flame ducked
I'm on the same slump, fucking with the same plug
Boolin' with my same Bloods, coolin' with the same Cuz
Where these niggas at, where the fuck these niggas at?
We gon' pull up, big bodies, with the glizzys in the back
I got Rugers and the MACs, punk, leave a nigga flat
Talkin' hot, we spin the block
We gon' leave him where he at, nigga
