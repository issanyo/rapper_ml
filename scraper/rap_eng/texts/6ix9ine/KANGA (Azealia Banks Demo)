[Intro: 6ix9ine]
These lil booties, they ain't matter over here
Now stop!

[Verse: Azealia Banks]
Old money sitting on top of new money
Shoe money stacked in the case and it's Lou, honey
Designer prints imported, I got it flew to me
Dubai, sipping on yachts, my niggas cruise for me
Designer tripping, this is Vivienne Westwood
The best of Versace shades, all signed in checkbooks
Chanel printed on my shirt, how my chest look?
I stunted on these bitches now I wonder how my ex look
Oh shit, a bad bitch over here
I'm getting dough bitch
You mad, leave it over there
The mer-queen came for the swim
These bitches mad wishing falls
But I'm leaving with wins, oh shit
And I see these bitches tryna get political
I slaughter these bitches
Y'all already seen what the chickens do
Hunnid bands, hunnid bands, hunnid bands
Run and dig it up, nigga, do the money dance
I'm iced out, jewels from Geneva
Bad bitch on the scene they be having to seen her, uh
I'm with Ye, then it's fucking TR3YWAY
Running shit up, counting money like it's payday
