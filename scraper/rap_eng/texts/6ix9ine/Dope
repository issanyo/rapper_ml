[Intro: PashaPG and 6ix9ine]
There's a lot of haters out here
So we gotta let 'em know what's up
They already know what's up!
Scum Gang, TR3YWAY, you don't want it!

[Verse 1: PashaPG]
I don't care what they sayin', 'cause you know I'm dope (Dope)
Got these bitches on my dick, 'cause you know I'm dope (Dope)
They used to talk shit, now they try to be my dogs
Try to be cool and shit, I would be like "nope!"
Cop-Cop-Cop the bands
Everybody on my block really was like "Woah"
And my Facebook got like 50,000 pokes
Got the city on my back, 'cause you know I'm dope
Thick bitch swallow dick, you know what's low
She said she like my swag and she like my flow
And tonight she would love to try my rope
I'm like "Damn girl, I see you really want that woke"
Now she don't talk much, all she do is blow, um
That's right, going hard, got money, got swag
Got hunnies, do your thing, if you feel like you running
Be official, be so beneficial
Hold your position, you can't do it?
I'm like "Fuck it, I'll just stay official", uh

[Hook: PashaPG]
I don't care what they're sayin', 'cause you know I'm dope (Dope)
Got the shakes in my hat, 'cause you know I'm dope (Dope)
They used to talk shit, now they try to be my dogs
Try to be cool and shit, I would be like "nope!" (N-Nope)
I don't care what they're sayin', 'cause you know I'm dope (Dope)
Got the shakes in my hat, 'cause you know I'm dope (Dope)
They used to talk shit, now they try to be my dogs
Try to be cool and shit, I would be like "nope!" (N-Nope)

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Talk to me nice or don't talk at all
Shotti3 got a two, and it's busting off
Got the pump and all, this shit jumping off
Look to a trip, turn 'em all
Thirty clips, extendos, nigga
Shooters all go off the wind blow, nigga
We don't miss lil' nigga, you hit lil' nigga
Ride on god and my chick gon’ get ya
One in your head, you in your bed
We in your crib, you X'd out
Two in your head, your boo in your bed
Don’t wanna touch this wet blouse
Talk to the feds, I call up cadet
I throw him a Sharpie, he wire your mouth
Always in depth, I go get home
I go in the trunk, get them TECs out

[Hook: PashaPG]
I don't care what they're sayin', 'cause you know I'm dope (Dope)
Got the shakes in my hat, 'cause you know I'm dope (Dope)
They used to talk shit, now they try to be my dogs
Try to be cool and shit, I would be like "nope!" (N-Nope)
I don't care what they're sayin', 'cause you know I'm dope (Dope)
Got the shakes in my hat, 'cause you know I'm dope (Dope)
They used to talk shit, now they try to be my dogs
Try to be cool and shit, I would be like "nope!" (N-Nope)
