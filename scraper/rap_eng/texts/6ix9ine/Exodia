[Hook: 6ix9ine & J $tash]
It's that Titanic, iceberg, bitch, I'm fucking sinking
It's that Titanic, iceberg, I'm over-fucking-thinking, yeah
Titanic, iceberg, bitch, I'm fucking sinking

[Verse 1: J $tash]
Hold up, riding with the two Glocks
Who hot? You not, hoes call me 2Pac
Titanic on my left wrist, cost me two block
J $tash, chain splash, red, yellow, blue watch
Mind you a flip, tell a bitch through a tube sock
Truck, get up front, no top when I do drop
Rolling up a blunt, take a puff, getting too high
Two white girls on my dick, gettin' creampied
Uh, shit get nasty, Susie, Tanya Leslie, Ashley
Uh, bitch, come catch me, Louie, Gucci, Fendi, flashy
Eh, bitch, you ashy, can't talk to me, bitch, you trashy
Uh, keep it classy, got me a new bitch, look like Ashley

[Hook: Xen Black]
It's that Titanic, iceberg, bitch, I'm fucking sinking
It's that Titanic, iceberg, I'm over-fucking-thinking, yeah
Titanic, iceberg, bitch, I'm fucking sinking
It's that Titanic, iceberg, I'm over-fucking-thinking, yeah

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Run it, run it, run it (run it), gun it, gun it, gun it (gun it)
Taking souls, digging holes, pulling triggers, yeah, we busting
Watch your eyes fake the dump, when this gun fuckin' buck
Concrete shoes and all, body lay under the tongue
Run dead on a nigga on the back block
Closed door jig, get ya head popped
Straight drop, 40 CAL flip him like a laptop
Red beam on the gun, sound like cyclops
Bitch, what the fuck is you thinking?
Bitch, what the fuck is you thinking?
Bitch, what the fuck is you thinking?
All of my niggas gon' spray it
