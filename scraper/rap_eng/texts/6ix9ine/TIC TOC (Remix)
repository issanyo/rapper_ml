[Intro]
Yung Lan on the track

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Okay, tick tock, Audemars wrist watch
I keep a stick, I keep a big Glock
You get hit, I do not miss shots
I keep a stick, I tell her, "Kick rocks"
Okay, get rocks, wrist go drip, drop
I do not kiss, you making shit hot
You think I'm dumb, I ain't no kid
Thought you was in love
You ain't my bitch, nah

[Verse: AYLEK$]
Aye-aye, AYLEK$!
Your vision division, can't fit in my time frame
Connecting the dots comparing our dreams
We just say the same thing
Now I'm chasing a bag, and I'm blowing the stacks
Get it back on the same day
No bullshit on my jack, rubber blow in the back
Can you fuck her the same day?
Tell me, how many bands is you really finna spend right now?
If you really wanna dance, you gon' use no hands
And just shake that upside down
Got a little big booty, bitch, her kitty cat go meow
Got a little AYLEK$ switch, they really wanna put me down

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Okay, tick tock, Audemars wrist watch
I keep a stick, I keep a big Glock
You get hit, I do not miss shots
I keep a stick, I tell her, "Kick rocks"
Okay, get rocks, wrist go drip, drop
I do not kiss, you making shit hot
You think I'm dumb, I ain't no kid
Thought you was in love
You ain't my bitch, nah
