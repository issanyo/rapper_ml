[Intro]
Wish you never done that
Wish you never brought that
Wish you never wore that
Wish I could bring South back
Wish you never brought that
Wish you never wore that
Wish I could bring South back

[Hook]
Wish you never done that, I come back
Wish you never brought that, I bust back
Wish you never wore that, so run that
Wish I could bring South back, I love Stat
Wish you never done that, I come back
Wish you never brought that, I bust back
Wish you never wore that, so run that
Wish I could bring South back, I love Stat

[Verse]
Wish I could bring Pun back, blaow, nigga, run that
'Til they let Rowdy out, we gon' let these Hollows out
Wish I could bring Stacks back, Kyle, let the MAC clap
'Til they free Biggavel, gotta give you niggas hell
Blicky make that nigga yell, beam hit his knees
Made him scream, when that nigga fell, shootout with the law
Or the morgue 'fore I sit in jail, niggas say they love me
But I can see it in these niggas eyes, they don't wish me well
I don't need their company, they smilin' when a nigga fell
Seein' that I'm poppin', then the shotgun, like the third round
Order stitches for these snitches, dead men tell no tales
Diggin' ditches for these niggas, toss 'em in, so well
Drive-by, leave him in the street, nigga, road kill
HBA, gold frost, let me guess, "So trill"?
Nigga, this is New York, make the wrong move
And the goons let the tools bark, so work hard and move salt

[Hook]
Wish you never done that, I come back
Wish you never brought that, I bust back
Wish you never wore that, so run that
Wish I could bring South back, I love Stat
Wish you never done that, I come back
Wish you never brought that, I bust back
Wish you never wore that, so run that
Wish I could bring South back, I love Stat
