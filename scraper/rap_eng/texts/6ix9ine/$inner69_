Lyrics from snippet

[Verse 1: SosMula]
Thot-like bitch had a 2Pac bullet
Wrist froze nigga with guwop stomach
Spin through your block with the uwop bustin'
Rich through the east, like, who block running?
Clap more guns, then we carry more bricks
Rims so heavy, I'ma need a forklift
Pull up in a 'Rari, nigga, with them doors lift
Knife on my AK, like a swordfish
What happened to you?
Laughing at you for havin' to shoot
Swell off and take off a fraction of you
Night full of views
Mad that your boo blew her back in the coupe
I was 16, sellin' crack by the school
Needing the cash, or the racks, all them blue
Look in the middle, who nicer to you?
Biting my style like Tyson would do

[Chorus: ZillaKami]
Sawed off in the cut
Gettin' numb, what the fuck?
We don't duck, bitch, what's up?
We don't duck, bitch, what's up?
I'm the dog, I ain't change
Empty it out, they clear the way
Empty it out, they gotta pray
Exit out, stick to the prey

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Boy, fuck you thought?
Nigga my hands don't talk, nigga my bite don't bark
Fuck you thought? Nigga you ain't no star
You slide up, get lock jaw
I came to the block, I paid for the Glock
Gunshot, gunshot, one time, one time
I paid for the rocks, I stuffed the socks
One sale, one sale, top notch, top notch
I run up on nigga, go ape on a nigga
No face, no chase, no trace on a nigga
License place ain't facing the nigga
Never ever will I catch a fade from a nigga

[Chorus: ZillaKami]
Sawed off in the cut
Gettin' numb, what the fuck?
We don't duck, bitch, what's up?
We don't duck, bitch, what's up?
I'm the dog, I ain't change
Empty it out, they clear the way
Empty it out, they gotta pray
Exit out, stick to the prey
