[Hook: Xen Black]
Aye, Titanic, iceberg, bitch, I'm fucking sinking
It's the Titanic, iceberg, I'm over-fucking-thinking, yeah
Titanic, iceberg, bitch, I'm fucking sinking
It's the Titanic, iceberg, I'm over-fucking-thinking, yeah

[Verse 1: Xen Black]
Loner a stroller, night time walker
Skrrt Cobain, like Kurt night Crawler
Folding her over like rolling a boulder
You rolling a blunt and I'm rolling her over
Shoulders is colder, feeling un-sober
Falling over like Xen is too sloppy
The gritty, the grimey, mighty I'm morphing
Like ooze to ivan, said fuck it I'm wildin'
I don't wanna feel shit, blade with the quick-flip
Gone with the quickness, I been disturbed
Bitch I'm down with the sickness, down with the sixes
Triple I rip shit, rest you in pieces
Skin gon' rip sick, body bag gone zip
Pulling out the Tommy, someone call Dr.Lipschitz
Suck a dick, dipshit, getting your wrist slit
If you're a witness, bitches, what?

[Hook: Xen Black]
Titanic, iceberg, bitch, I'm fucking sinking
It's the Titanic, iceberg, I'm over-fucking-thinking, yeah
Titanic, iceberg, bitch, I'm fucking sinking
It's the Titanic, iceberg, I'm over-fucking-thinking, yeah

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Run it, run it, run it (run it), gun it, gun it, gun it (gun it)
Taking souls, digging holes, pulling triggers, yeah, we busting
Watch your eyes fake the dump, when this gun fuckin' buck
Concrete shoes and all, body lay under the tongue
Run dead on a nigga on the back block
Closed door jig, get ya head popped, straight drop
40 CAL flip him like a laptop
Red beam on the gun, sound like cyclops
Bitch, what the fuck is you thinking? (thinking)
Bitch, what the fuck is you thinking? (thinking)
Bitch, what the fuck is you thinking? (thinking)
All of my niggas gon' spray it

[Hook: Xen Black]
Aye, Titanic, iceberg, bitch, I'm fucking sinking
It's the Titanic, iceberg, I'm over-fucking-thinking, yeah
Titanic, iceberg, bitch, I'm fucking sinking
It's the Titanic, iceberg, I'm over-fucking-thinking, yeah
