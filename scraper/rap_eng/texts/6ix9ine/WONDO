Scott Storch

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Shorty, don't clap-back on the dick (On the dick, hey!)
Don’t clap-back on the dick (On the dick)
Bitch, when I hit that, do a split (Hey!)
When I hit that, do a trick
Shorty, don't clap-back on the dick (On the dick, hey!)
Don't clap-back on the dick (On the dick)
Bitch, when I hit that, do a split (Hey)
When I hit that, do a trick

[Verse: 6ix9ine]
Know I keep a tool on me
I come in the room, I might have to move on ’em
Scope with a zoom, fuck around and boom, homie
I stay with a broom on me, better move, homie
'Fore you in a tomb, on me
We gon' bring the MACs out, we back out and spazz out
Yeah that's a blackout, get dragged out and packed out
Yeah, my trap house, I call it the black house
We move the packs out, we gon' blow the mags out

[Bridge: TrifeDrew]
All in, anybody that'll do it (Hey!)
Everybody in the party getting stupid (Hey!)
All these thotties in the party, I ain't choosing (Hey!)
I'm off the Henny and the chuck, I might lose it (Hey!)

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Shorty, don’t clap-back on the dick (On the dick, hey!)
Don’t clap-back on the dick (On the dick)
Bitch, when I hit that, do a split (Hey!)
When I hit that, do a trick
Shorty, don't clap-back on the dick (On the dick, hey!)
Don’t clap-back on the dick (On the dick)
Bitch, when I hit that, do a split (Hey)
When I hit that, do a trick

[Outro: TrifeDrew]
