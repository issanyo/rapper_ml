[Intro]
Yung Lan on the track

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Okay, tick tock, Audemars wrist watch
I keep a stick, I keep a big Glock
You get hit, I do not miss shots
I keep a stick, I tell her, "Kick rocks"
Okay, get rocks, wrist go drip, drop
I do not kiss, you making shit hot
You think I'm dumb, I ain't no kid
Thought you was in love
You ain't my bitch, nah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
She on my drip drop
She ain't never went both ways, but I made them lip lock
Left her at the condo for days, she was at the tip top
Might as well throw away the key, I got the streets locked
I been drinkin' all this lean, I know I need to stop
Hoppin' out of stolen cars, and we shoot chops at opps
Two flooded out Rolexes, they don't tick or tock
Lemme catch your lil' shorty, she gettin' picked apart
Everything up to par

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
I got them big rocks in my ear, nuggets
I got my whole team flooded
Saks Off Fifth, I'm with your bitch
She buying everything I wanted
She fly me out to Waikiki
LV all on her bikini
Take her money, go Houdini
I call her when I want eat-eat
On my feet, you see them CC's
Neck and ears, you see them VV's
On my jeans, you see them GG's
Treat that bitch like she a fefe
Big body Benz, that's beep-beep
Hit it in the back of the Jeep-Jeep
That bitch know she a freak-freak
And the pussy staying on leak-leak

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
Okay, tick tock, Audemars wrist watch
I keep a stick, I keep a big Glock
You get hit, I do not miss shots
I keep a stick, I tell her, "Kick rocks"
Okay, get rocks, wrist go drip, drop
I do not kiss, you making shit hot
You think I'm dumb, I ain't no kid
Thought you was in love
You ain't my bitch, nah
