[Intro]
This is a Jaasu Production

[Hook: WILLY BLANCØ]
I'm working harder than I ever did before
You could just go, 'cause I'ma just blow
I said I'm just tryna flex, man, I'm just tryna ball
If it ain't about money then I won't pick up the call
I'm working harder than I ever did before
You could just go, 'cause I'ma just glow
I said I'm just tryna flex, man, I'm just tryna ball
If it ain't about money then I won't pick up the call

[Verse 1: WILLY BLANCØ]
It's all about the money, it's all about the cash
Got a lot of racks, I need to make this money fast
The difference between me and you is you ain't lax
The difference between me and you is that I'm tryna last
Made about 10 Gs, same thing, you know I'ma blow it
Stacks in my Tommy drawers, you know I'ma show it
Got a bad bitch and she flyer than a Boeing
Took her to my room and we sip on that purple potion
I don't like no game shit so you can take a notion
I don't hang with no one who ain't cool with money blowing
Skrt, skrt, hold up, hold up, everyday I'm blowing
And you know that I'm on my Samsung and I'm motorolling
And you know I got hang-ons and your life they gon' be towing
And you know when my phone go (*beep*) my shooters gon' be going
Not afraid to take a life for me and all my homies
720, bang bang, make sure you fucking know me
