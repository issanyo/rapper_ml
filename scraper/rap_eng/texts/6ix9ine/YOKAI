[Intro]
Scum Gang!

[Hook: 6ix9ine]
For my cold killers, for my soul lifters
Body bag fillers, for my go-getters
Trey-eight gripper, dope brick flipper
Bad bitch hitter, foreign drop whipper
For my cold killers, for my soul lifters
Body bag fillers, for my go-getters
Trey-eight gripper, dope brick flipper
Bad bitch hitter, foreign drop whipper

[Bridge: 6ix9ine & ZillaKami]
Maniac, all black
Click clack, fall back
Take ya bitch, dog that
Flip switch, roach trap
Dead case, solve that
Gun clap, high hat
Click clack, absolve that
Boy, brrat, boy, brrat

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Pistol to ya melon, quit that yellin', I'ma count to 3
Lowin' on the block, with my Scums all surrounding me
Still up in the trap, where the hustlers and the addicts be
Popping shit'll get you split, turn this to a tragedy
Beat you to a pulp, with a sock full of batteries
Shottie to ya dome, make your ass defy gravity
Fucking bitches, Sake sipping, nigga had to quit the lean
Young scummy money gang, Scum Gang, Medell√≠n

[Verse 2: ZillaKami & 6ix9ine]
Ruger spit
Pop ya back, I came up in the game, who's really doing it?
Pop ya back, I came up in the game, who's really shooting it?
Move the split, split the spliff, release the pits
Screaming "honey, get the kids"
Screaming "homie, jump the fence"
Purge the yay', ball of eight, have 'em twisting, turning ways
Purge the yay', ball of eight, flip it, double up the pay
Okay, now, Chad did acid once and now he be hearing voices
I had to link with 6ix9ine because the beefing was pointless
Was closing curtains in the hearses
While y'all boys was wearing purses
Servin' service, swervin' in suburbans
Rims scraping the surface
Put him in a coffin, toss him
Smother him, cover him
Dirt bed, "Dead" white shirt said
Muzzle him, put him in the linen hammer and bang
'Til my body break the chains, it's Scum to the Gang
(Squad)

For my cold killers, for my soul lifters

Trey-eight gripper, dope brick flipper
