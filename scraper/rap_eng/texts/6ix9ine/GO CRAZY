[Hook: 6ix9ine]
Throw the roll, fingers up, pistols getting finger fucked
Nigga try to act tough, hit him with the Mac Truck
Body bag, zip him up, 40 clip, rip him up
Other side, they ain't tough, our side fuck it up

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Niggas my gang, when the thing go bang
Roll the window down, let me do my thang
I go insane, hit him in his brain, that boy is stained
Y'ada niggas bluff, y'all niggas ain't tough
I know some Bloods, they wet you up
That's just because, boy fuck you thought?
Nigga my hands don't talk, nigga my bite don't bark
Fuck you thought? Nigga you ain't no star
You slide up, get lock jaw
I came to the block, I paid for the Glock
Gunshot, gunshot, one time, one time
I paid for the rocks, I stuffed the socks
One sale, one sale, top notch, top notch
I run up on nigga, go ape on a nigga
No face, no chase, no trace on a nigga
License place ain't facing the nigga
Never ever will I catch a fade from a nigga
Boy, fuck you thought? My squad go crazy
Try and put us in cages, can't contain us
My block go crazy, my squad go crazy
(Squad)

[Verse 2: Hudson Flo]
But I got that juice (huh!), and I got that sauce (huh!)
My squad go crazy, ain't scared to shoot (boom!)
What the fuck you thought? (what!)
If you on that stoop, you droppin' Ks (ah)
And you take a loss, let me call my troops
Oh, you think you warrin'? (what)
We'll take you off, yeah them things get tossed (rrah)
Catch me I'm whipping I'm spinning the block
Catch him in the shoulder, I'm spinning an opp (let's get it)
Nowadays we sending a lot, prollywhy my gang winning the pot
Gotta take risks, you know they say crime pays
I'm trying to paid like nine ways and I'll find ways
When it's time it's time, can't time fade (nope)
But I gotta keep moving (what), these boys steady looking close
While I'm looking for her, pull up on the block (woo!)
Hopped out at the bodega, they lookin' hard
I'm looking fly like I took their card (ah)
Hopped out, then they took it all
But none of my shit, only thing he took
Was a clip that he took at heart
