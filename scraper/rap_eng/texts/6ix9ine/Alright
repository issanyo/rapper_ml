[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Niggas want war, yeah, kick the door, yeah
Run up, break your jaw, yeah, get it on, yeah
I'ma hit a stain, yeah, broad day, yeah
Niggas act fake, yeah, catch a fade, yeah
Niggas said I changed, yeah, made some change, yeah
I could never change, yeah, still the same, yeah
I'm still in the hood, yeah, busting juggs, yeah
Puffing on a Wood, yeah, smoking good, yeah
Shorty want a pic, yeah, that ain't shit, yeah
Told her do a trick, yeah, on the dick, yeah
Bust her whole shit, yeah, in her ribs, yeah
Leave her with my kids, yeah, on her lips, yeah
Skrrt off in the Benz, yeah, doing tricks, yeah
Two hundred on the dash, yeah, tell the cashier
They want me, I don't lack, yeah, got my gat, yeah
Talk hot on getting whacked, yeah, body bag, yeah

[Chorus: BlitzedOffLeah]
I want your drugs not your love, is that alright?
What she whips and won't you tell me what you like?
We can just light up an L and smoke all night
I'ma do you right, baby, so hold on tight
I want your drugs not your love, is that alright?
What she whips and won't you tell me what you like?
We can just light up an L and smoke all night
I'ma do you right, baby, so hold on tight

[Verse 2: Warhol.ss]
Hol' up, ayy, yeah, shawty, how you do it?
Pinky ring clean and that boy actin' foolish, uh
Why you looking at my neck? Uh, chain iced up
Aye, aye, stepping up on why they say I'm fly as fuck
Aye, yuh, niggas can't fuck with the kid though
Raw stepping in, diamonds shining like a rainbow
Ooh, aye, shorty want, I'ma paint her face though
Paint her face, though, feel like Picasso
And no bravado, and no Fusaro
Coming in here, coming in here, dump the bankroll, uh
Got the bankroll, uh, 'cause I do these shows, uh
And I count that guap, uh, and I fuck these hoes

[Chorus: BlitzedOffLeah]
I want your drugs not your love, is that alright?
What she whips and won't you tell me what you like?
We can just light up an L and smoke all night
I'ma do you right, baby, so hold on tight
I want your drugs not your love, is that alright?
What she whips and won't you tell me what you like?
We can just light up an L and smoke all night
I'ma do you right, baby, so hold on tight
