[Intro: 6ix9ine & Gringo]
Yeah, straight mob ties, five brothers, SLS
TR3YWAY shit, east side, yuh
Goldfinger, oh-oh (Scum Gang!)
Gigi, yuh
Gigi, what?
Gigi, yeah, uh
Ay, ay, ay
Yo, Gringo, let that shit breathe!

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Wish I could bring Pun back, blaow, nigga, run that
'Til they let Remmy out, we gon' let these semis out
Wish I could bring Stacks back, Chad, let the MAC clap
'Til they free Biggavel, gotta give you niggas hell
Blicky make that nigga yell, beam hit his knees
Made him scream, when that nigga fell, shootout with the law
Or the morgue  'fore I sit in jail, niggas say they love me
I can see it in these niggas eyes, they don't wish me well
I don't need their company, they smilin' when a nigga fell
Seein' that I'm poppin', then the shotgun, like the third round
Order stitches for these snitches, dead men tell no tales
Diggin' ditches for these niggas, toss 'em in, so well
Drive-by, leave him in the street, nigga, road kill
HBA, gold fronts, let me guess, "So trill"?
Nigga, this is New York, make the wrong move
And the goons let the tool spark, work hard and move salt
8 Ball like pool holes, cracked like the pavement
Diesel like the gas station, trap out the basement
Blow in the Pyrex, mask on our faces
Let 'em act sketch, but this lead will erase 'em, on gang
