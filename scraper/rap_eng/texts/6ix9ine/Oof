[Chorus: Spoken Arcane & 6ix9ine]
Lean up on my roof (skah)
Gold up in my tooth (what?!)
Cop another coupe (skrt!)
Felon on the loose
Lean up on my roof (brrt!)
Gold up in my tooth
Cop-Cop-Cop another coupe (alright)
Felon on the loose (eh)

[Verse 1: 6ix9ine]
Quali' or the tech (ah)

Riding with that vest (brrt)
Hit you in your chest (ka-ka-ka-kaka)

That bitch she's so wet (she wet)
Finesse her out a check (gimme that, gimme that)

[Chorus: Spoken Arcane & 6ix9ine]
Lean up on my roof (skah)

Gold up in my tooth
Cop-Cop-Cop another coupe (alright)
Felon on the loose (eh)

[Verse 2: Spoken Arcane]
Fuck you talkin' 'bout?
I been out my town
Making all these sounds
Yeah, I got it from the underground
Pumpin' round after round
Yeah, I'm hitting no rebounds
Fuck you mean? Yeah, I got it
Motherfucker, look around
Finna get it back, move around the map
Yeah I make it flip, never looking back
I been out my vibe, never gonna  die
Let the tires slide, I'm down to fuckin' ride
Been out here with the same old thing
Pop that back and I let that bang
Grab that chalk and I make that lane
Roll my woods with that platinum flame
Think about what I wanted now
Ain't going down I'm coming up
We pulling up, you know what's up
Catch up, don't give a fuck

[Chorus: Spoken Arcane & 6ix9ine]
Lean up on my roof (skah)
Gold up in my tooth (what?!)
Cop another coupe (skrt!)
Felon on the loose
Lean up on my roof (brrt!)
Gold up in my tooth
Cop-Cop-Cop another coupe (alright)
Felon on the loose (eh)
