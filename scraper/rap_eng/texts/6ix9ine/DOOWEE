Scum Gang!

[Verse]
Gun to his head like Kenzo, uh
Can't get too comfy ya kinfolk, uh
I don't got the mop, I got the supersoaker, uh
Make a nigga run, Usain Bolt, uh (bah)

Clip lookin' like Mandingo, uh
Wet his ass up, no homo, uh
Made a nigga wish he had a raincoat, uh
If you up to something, we gon' get to bustin'
My niggas for nothing, shoot you and your cousin
We could get to thumpin', not for the discussion
On the block drummin', shoot you in your stomach
Scum Gang bloody, Scum Gang cousins
Throw it up nigga, show 'em how we comin'
All my niggas rugged, all my niggas thuggin'
Totin' pistol, buggin', this is how we comin'
Don't-Don't be on my block jackin' no foo' shit
You gon' get buck fifty in ya face, call me split
I don't fuck with bitch niggas, way my round, nigga, dip
I don't fuck with broke bitches, way my round, bitch, dip
