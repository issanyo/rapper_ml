[Intro: Armoo & 6ix9ine]
6ix9ine, we gonna make these haters burn
You know that shit, back in the store
Get your money up, not your funny up, you on?

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
My niggas got a streetsweeper, air the whole block out
I'll fuck around and blow the whole stock out
Real street nigga, we gon’ fuck around and pop out
See them black trucks? We gon' hop out (Hop out)
We gon' bend your block and we gon’ spin again (Spin again)
We ain't hit his head, so we gon' spin again (Spin again)
If she wanna fuck, she gotta bring a friend
That bitch, she a 5, but off Henny, she a 10

[Verse 1: Armoo]
Nobody can touch my clique
All these other rappers, suck my dick
My pockets thicker than your filled up lips
And my homies be shooting you if you keep talk shit
I told you, no respect
Just fill my pockets with stacks
I'ma getting loads up
Guns ready, load up
Netherlands I blow up
I ain't working with you punk ass rappers no more (No)
This is my glow up, homie (Bitch)

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
My niggas got a streetsweeper, air the whole block out
I'll fuck around and blow the whole stock out
Real street nigga, we gon' fuck around and pop out
See them black trucks? We gon' hop out (Hop out)
We gon’ bend your block and we gon’ spin again (Spin again)
We ain't hit his head, so we gon’ spin again (Spin again)
If she wanna fuck, she gotta bring a friend
That bitch, she a 5, but off Henny, she a 10

[Verse 2: 6ix9ine & Armoo]
Armoo got the shotty to your body
6ix9ine, we're ready for everybody
We gon' fucking slide on these niggas
We don't even think about pulling the trigger, ah!
We gon’ make sure we leave these fuck niggas dead
Load the clip up then fill 'em up with lead
Forty got a whole lot of kickback
Click, clack, run up and make ya shit pack

[Chorus: 6ix9ine]
My niggas got a streetsweeper, air the whole block out
I'll fuck around and blow the whole stock out
Real street nigga, we gon' fuck around and pop out
See them black trucks? We gon' hop out (Hop out)
We gon' bend your block and we gon' spin again (Spin again)
We ain't hit his head, so we gon' spin again (Spin again)
If she wanna fuck, she gotta bring a friend
That bitch, she a 5, but off Henny, she a 10
