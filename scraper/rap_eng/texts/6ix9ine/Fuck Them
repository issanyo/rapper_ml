[Verse 2: 6ix9ine]
Bitch, you got me fucked up
Bitch, you got it fucked up
Bitch nigga, pull up
Bitch nigga, what's up? (what's up?)
Niggas don't want no smoke
See them, they choke
Buck 50 through his nose
Then I take a nigga bitch
Head to the trap, all my niggas giving gold
All my niggas trained to go
Upping the pole, TTG, we let it go
Whack a nigga like a mole
40 CAL through his soul
Then we hit the road
Down when he see me
Run down when he see me
Off the pump or the semi
Nigga better bust rounds when he see me
Bust rounds when he see me
Spin the block with the glizzy
All opps gon' drop when they see me
Gon' drop when they see me (what's up?)
Duct tape on his mouth
Boy, he won't make a sound when he see me
Make a sound when he see me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! What's up?)
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But this MAC-11 take his soul
Gag his tongue, burn the pride
They don't know, they learn tonight
Tie him up, pour some gasoline on him, light him up
Five Xan' bars with the lean got me high as fuck

[Pre-Hook: Moe Dollaz]
I flam it, I blam, it I spam it, I jam it

[Hook: Moe Dollaz]
Fucked up, fucked up, fucked up, fucked up
Fucked up, fucked up, guess you got a nigga
Fucked up, fucked up, fucked up, fucked up
Fucked up, fucked up, yeah you got a nigga

[Outro: 6ix9ine]
Sixth-House, they got you fucked up
What's up?
