[Intro]
Scum Gang
GHXST
Yo 6ix9ine, talk your shit bro
Niggas don't want no part
It's rundown season, hold it down
It's only the squad

[Chorus]
They say when they see me they gon' wet me
Still ain't wet shit (they ain't wet shit)
They say when they see me they gon' test me
Still ain't said shit (they ain't said shit)
They said when they see me they gon' rob me
Still ain't took shit (they ain't rob shit)
They said when they see me I'ma run
I don't duck bitch (we don't duck)

[Verse 1]
All that talking, boy, stop (boy stop)
Heard you dancing, boy, stop (boy stop)
Need a lesson, boy, stop (boy stop)
Ain't no missing, boy, stop (boy stop)
With that popping, boy, stop (boy stop)
I know what's cracking, boy, stop (boy stop)
What you jacking? Boy, stop (boy stop)
What you saying? Boy, stop (boy stop)
All that talking that you doing gon' get your boy shot (grrah, grrah)
All them hollows in his chest gon' make his heart stop (blaow)
With that 30 in your face, like, "what's in your spot?" (grr, grr)
Run that bitch, run that cash, fuck with us, you cannot (fucker, fucker)

[Chorus]
They say when they see me they gon' wet me
Still ain't wet shit (they ain't wet shit)
They say when they see me they gon' test me
Still ain't said shit (they ain't said shit)
They said when they see me they gon' rob me
Still ain't took shit (they ain't rob shit)
They said when they see me I'ma run
I don't duck bitch (we don't duck)

[Verse 2]
You don't know what it is, B.O.T.S.O
You don't know what it is, facing fifty 'front the judge
You don't know what it is when you bet 100k
What it is, stickin' up commands on the fuckin' tear (stick it up!)
This jail shit'll show you
Who's a fraud, who a fake (for real)
Who's just talkin' just to talk
Who's just hatin' just to hate (for real)
Do my thang, I'm a real individual (for real)
Fuck a fraud nigga who's goal is try to swindle you (fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em)
Goons all around me, killers all around me (squad, squad)
Snitches get from 'round me, get that 40 on me (clip, blaow)
Goons all around me, killers all around me (squad, squad)
Snitches get from 'round me, get that 40 on me (clip, blaow)
Yeah we rolling T-T-T (got the gat)
And I keep it E-B-E (got the gat)
Shout Y-G-C
On my block, banging N-D-G (squad)
Yeah we jackin' E-B-K (got the gat)
No man is G-B-G (got the gat)
Y-S and D-O-D
Gang signs all L-O-D (got the gat)

[Chorus]
They say when they see me they gon' wet me
Still ain't wet shit (they ain't wet shit)
They say when they see me they gon' test me
Still ain't said shit (they ain't said shit)
They said when they see me they gon' rob me
Still ain't took shit (they ain't rob shit)
They said when they see me I'ma run
I don't duck bitch (we don't duck, nigga)
