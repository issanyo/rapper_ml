[Verse 2]
Boy you know you ain't thuggin', nigga
You ain't really on nothin', nigga
You don't want no trouble, nigga, you a fumble, nigga
You don't want it with my Harlem, nigga
Under pressure, you'll crumble, nigga, quit frontin', nigga
Boy you need to be humble, nigga, ten toes, I don't stumble, nigga
Double-double nigga, ten shots, ten clips, one clip
I don't got no jumper nigga, man, I swear this shit no fair
You don't wanna end up in the crosshairs
Leave a nigga froze up in his Moncler
ACOG on his mug make 'em more clear
And I swear that the niggas deserve it, uh
Niggas they snakes, they serpents, uh
They pussy and that is my verdict, uh
Retaliate then we burnin' 'em
I bust and I know that I'm hurtin' 'em
She suckin' him off the Percy, uh
She love me, she say I'm so perfect, uh
That's your bitch, she suckin' my posse up
We squaded, we lookin' like a mafia
I'm booted, I popped me a molly, uh
I'm geekin', I'm rowdy, I'm fired up
I wish a little nigga would try and run up, bang!
