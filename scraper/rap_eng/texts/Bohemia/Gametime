[Verse 1: Bohemia]
Game time vajjay bass line
Tandrust likhari sare par likhe sick crime KDM
Mixtape jive criminals
Saare katthay hoke kam karan chale bina crime
Good luck!
Ik toh ek, khatarnak shuqs
Ik te nayi mainu saareyan te shuq
Kise ik di kive karan tareef
Munde naal mere jerhe saare char so bees

[Verse 2: J.Hind]
Ah chal, I'm a char so bees
Top of the food chain char so fees (That's right!)
Eating char so bees
Pissin' on your pants, takin' char so leaks
Been in the game
Since the gas tank was on khali
Act up and get it up, happy Diwali! (Brrr!)
Wake me for my nana
Was the king of qavaali
I was in my ga.. Kali denali!

[Verse 3: Shaxe Oriah]
They keep on bumpin'
Bumpin' my song, my song
I am off that Cali confidential
Chakde tu meri jaan, tu meri jaan ahh!
KDM double back gun
Yo bhi ton gang bang, if you don't get right
Mere jaisa duniya mein koi rap nai
Kar payega sherni ka puttar hoga

[Verse 4: Pardhaan]
Huaa game time on
Check karo meri tone
Kafi gusse mein hun
Duniya wale huay maun
Volume one, KDM mixtape
Desi Hip-Hop ke Avengers
Panga le ga kaun?
Hum kandi chhorhe, saare chaurhay hore
Daurha dainge thare saare dimag ke ghode
Jinke ghutno mein akal thi
Wo main saare thode
Thok dainge maar kalam ke hathode

[Verse 5: Haji Springer]
(Springer!)
Char so ghorhe
Brand new bass
And I feelin' like a winner
'Cause you know I always win, uh! (Win, uh!)
You know I am with the KDM uh!
You know we gettin' the money, no ATM huh?
So stay the fuck up out my way
Well make my day
My young goons will slay the K
And we prolly gon' to fade away
Who gives a fuck what the haters say?

[Verse 6: Raxstar]
Bitch! It's safe to say you ain't the same
Since you couldn't cut it like a blunt razor blade
I got enough on my plate
I don't need your portion
Make way for the apocalyptic horsemen
Cream of the crop jive dudh malai da
Everybody hungry pukh nalo kai da
We don't pay for nothin' now
Muft sannu chayida
Way too many bars
Naiyo hook sannu chayida

[Verse 7: 3AM Sukhi]
Hi hater took a brief hiatus
Briefcase full of money
Yes sir, I chief I vapours
Violators get fucked like vibrators
Its the KDM gang, we high like skyscrapers
Selfish people takin' selfies self-explanatory
Don't explain it to me, save that shit for Morrie
Hobby why you, actin' like your rap is nice?
Here's some advice man take your life, its KDM

[Verse 8: Young Desi]
Dudh chakeya glass utto payi Sprite
Utto sutya main lakk uttey pit aala powder
Uncle, chachi sarai tabbar
KDM mixtape sunda fuffarh
Lo ji doston, bazurgo, niyaneyo, seyaneyo
Young Desi, zara na nu pechanaeyo
Lo ji zindgi to tang firray chakeya qalam
Jive mast malang
Utton Lahore da rihaishi
Putt tharki pedaishi
Naale karda aiyashi
Putt paavin na tu neshi
Bakki sidhi-sidhi gal dassan jaan da ni sanu
Jerha khasma nu khavay
Ja dur fittemuh tera

[Verse 9: Gangis Khan]
My life's dirty like Mumbai streets
You could die please, don't push my keys
You wanna get nuts? Go ahead try these
Gangeezy to the grease, you know 'bout me
We rockin' bells, and we poppin' shells
I'm so hot what I drop till I say "What's up?!"
See me, I'm from a block that's as hard as hell
But when you see me in the flesh, it ain't hard to tell
(Its the KDM mixtape)

[Verse 10: Deep Jandu (x2)]
Munde naal saare char so bees
Karde nahio kise di rees
Check kar le speed
Gaane aun repeat
Munde hoge na faqir
Hun sarhde shareek

Munde naal saare char so bees
Dekhon behke khich de neet
Tole sirre da aa deed
Jitthay jaan hundi heat
Rakhi kali ae dunali vich
Vajjdi aa beat

[Outro (x4)]
Char so bees
