I want it right now
Girl take off take off
Keep on your hands
I want it right now
I'll be feeling your touch
I'm tryin' to f***ck..

I'll be wannin' you so bad
When you walk through the door
Right now I'm feeling that I'm feeling that
Never felt before
I can take you to the moon if you ready to go (go..)

Shanshah galiyo main raaj
Badshah mere sir pe taaj
Raja sari duniyan dikhaun tuje
Aaja mere piche log lage
Main jaun kaha tuje leke sath
USA se leke India dete hath tera dunga sath
Tuje milna nhi mere sa mere baad

Nachegay sari raat dance floor denge tod
Roke kiski mazaal main tera tu meri dil ki chor
Yaha dusman bahut dost kam
Mujh sa kaun kisme dum
Forget the rest i'm the one
And i ain't got time to tryin'

I want it right now (aaja mere sath sari raat)
I want it right now (aaja mere sath behishab)

Step in the building ya they know my name
Got couple of girls hangin' from my chain'
Tell me where you wanna go from here
I tell you what you wanna here
Are you ready..
Now show me what it do
Don't tell me what it does't
I'll be buzzin' up in the club meeting my cousin
That's how life starts
I need it right now

I want it right now (aaja mere sath sari raat)
I want it right now (aaja mere sath behishab)

3.. 3.. 3 in the mornin'
Party just started and she on in
I don't care just the liquor pourin'
Watchin' you with somebody
1000$ to get some water
Mention how much we spend on bottles
Live for today and... tomorrow
Live for today and... tomorrow

I want it right now

I want it right now (aaja mere sath sari raat)
I want it right now (aaja mere sath behishab)
