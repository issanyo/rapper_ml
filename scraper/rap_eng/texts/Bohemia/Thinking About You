Verse 1:
Who am I doesn't matter anyway
When i saw you walking through
Couldn't take my eyes away
Wondering if you think me
Time keeps on ti-ti-cking slowly
I need you right away

Pre-chorus:
Youre the one I've been looking for
Your the one , your the one I've been searching for
I Just dont know anymore
What to do cause of you im all alone

Chorus:
I can't stop thinking about you, thinking about you, thinking about you
I can't stop thinking about you, thinking about you, thinking about you

Verse 2:
You got me weak am falling, I can't breath
You do this everyday
Still I dont know your name
Its hard to breathe dont know what's wrong with me
Got a new habit and I gotta have it
Cause your my Ecstacy

Pre-chorus:
You're the one I've been looking for
You're the one, you're the one I've been searching for
I Just dont know anymore
What to do cause of you im all alone


Khayalan ch main rakhda khayal tera
Khair teri manga
Bhije na kadi koyi baal tera
Jadon di tere naal ladiyan akhiyan
Duniya kamaal lage mainu bebe, kamaal tera
Jawaban vich ghummeya sawal tera
Hunn vair duniya naal rakhan main ban ke yaar tera
Mainu tere pyar ch je jag maar dena
Jind ik hor rab ton udhaar laike vapas aaja
Mere naal lade jehda yaad rakhe
Kadam koyi meri jagah jehda mere baad rakhe
Sanam koyi tera meri jagah mere baad bane
Kissa mera tera
Teri akhiyan ch raaz bane

Geet sadda sukhan wala jadhon dukhi raat bane
Kasam tainu, tera mera kadi na mazak bane
Bhawein gal-baat na bane
Par gal-baat kithon bane
Jadon kadi saddi mulakat hi na bane
Teri yaad nu hun meri fariyad
Ho oh kinni der baad
Jivein kadi mainu kalle oh na chhade

Tere baad main lagda abaad
Par andron barbaad
Par lokan agge athru ni kadde
Din raat tera hi deedar
Main akhiyan jhukawan ya uthawan
Dekha sajje, dekha khabbe
Manni haar ve mere vass ton bahar
Ve koyi mainu bachaye
Ve tainu mere yaadan vichon kadde

Chorus:
I can't stop thinking about you
Thinking about you, thinking about you
I can't stop thinking about you
Thinking about you
Thinking about you

Bridge:
Din ho ya raat, Khayalon mein tum ho
Ab ek hi Umeed, Hai is dil ko

Chorus:
I can't stop thinking about you, thinking about you (Can't stop)
Thinking about you, Thinking about you, (No I Can't)
Can't stop thinking about you, thinking about you, thinking about you
Can't stop thinking about you, thinking about you, thinking about you
I can't stop yeah, thinking, thinking about you I can't Stop
