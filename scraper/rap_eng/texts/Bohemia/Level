[Verse 1][Sunnyboy]
Now We Don't Understand,
What You Are Talkin',
Your Models Were Just Go Ahead,
Keep Walkin'
Your Bank Accout Is,
Sittin' In My Pocket,
Your Girl Wanna Go Shopping,
As Imma A Boss, Count And Clocking,
Wo..
I'm All About My Money,
You Know, Thats A Fact,
I'm Super Turned Up,
Just Killed The Bottle Of Black,
Everytime I Come Around,
You Know I Make It Crack,
And If I Said It, Then I Mean It,
I Don't Take It Back,

[Bridge][Sunnyboy]
You ain't on my level
No you never not (never not)

No you never not (never not)
You ain't on my level
No you never not (never not)
You ain't on my level
You ain't on my level

[Chorus][Sunnyboy]
You ain't on my level

[Verse 2][Sunnyboy]
Nah! you ain't on my level
No you never will be
So.. so many people lovely,
Couple of haters wanna kill me
But it don't really matter
Cause imma still get this money
Just gotta call from
my fame and motherland
And they sayin' streets fillin' me
I did it I came in the game
And Shaded, they lovin' me now
(lovin' me now)
The sameone said I won't be sh*t
All tryna' huggin' me now
(huggin' me now)
I told all my real ones
When I go big imma open the door
(open the door)
Just smoke the whole pack
And I feelin' so good
I think I need some more (yeah..)

[Bridge][Sunnyboy]

[Verse 3][Bohemia]
Aapan roof top, top floor
Man of the match, top score

Jiven rogers de shot 2
One night stand ch notaan di thaddiyan
Meri rubberband ch karli,

Asi space ship chi galaxy paar vairi saday jevain galiyan chi paidal

Tuc ayda da time ni kadi waikh pao gay pavain karlo time travel
