[Verse 1 : Bohemia]
Shatranj meri chaal
Sat rang bemisaal
Jiven jang hathiyaar
Jiven jal de cigar
Jiven raaj mera ajje vi
Sir te peya taaj mera
Dava naal hona nahi ilaaj mera
Jaddo chalda main baazi
Kara kudiyan nu raazi
Ca-Cali to leke jithw takk desiyan di abaadi
Mere vairi metho sadan
Mere yaar mere aadi
Mere pishe gallan karan
Mere naal mere saathi

Brand new swag
Naal betha drop top Jag ch mai
Po-Po di mere te akh
Menu karan challe kaid
Mere (hath) hath ch cigar
Kara roz navi kudia nu pyaar
Haji Bohemia hun kehda saade vaste tyaar

[Pre-Hook : Panda]
Oh shit ! I didn't come up with a brand new Swag
Oh shit ! I didn't come up with a brand new Swag

[Hook : Panda]
Brand new every day swag (damnit!)
Brand new every day swag (damnit!)
Brand new every day swag (damnit!)
Brand new every day swag (d..d..damnit!)

[Verse 2; Haji Springer]
I got Unbelievable swag you know Mr. Haji
If I come to the party I'm leaving with m√©nage (hello)
I got couple of cars
I can take some girls in (po-po-oh!)
My chains all over your girlies
Man, I think she wants to suck it
And I'm never getting pump
But I stay with Ashton Kutcher
See I'm a late knight Rider
You can call me Ashton Kush-er
So many hundred dollar bills
They coming out of my jeans
Everyday so many boppers wanna join the team
So clean new Benz, so fucking extravaganza
Buddy, we'd (we sh-) we should be handin' out pampers
Ass blowing Panda gonna put your hands up
Oh you want that Swag?
I don't come with that answer

[Pre Hook : Panda}
Oh Shit! I didn't come with brand new swag
Oh shit! I didn't come with brand new swag

{Hook : Panda]
Brand new every day swag (damnit!)
Brand new every day swag (damnit!)
Brand new every day swag (damnit!)
Brand new every day swag (d.. d... damnit!)
