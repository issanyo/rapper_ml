[Canibus]
The black Pope fastens the rope, slashes the GOAT
Drinks animal blood from my black bowl then lash from the throat
Remove stash from the coke, laugh, joke, smoke, pass the dro
The fastest will be the last to go
Sky watches record the speech of the jaguar priest
Rain wizards who control the rainforest beast
Bars, give me more of them, the mad warrior, Ad nauseam
Canibus, listen to them calling him
Rapid fire some lyrics like Big Pun spitting
Like the time I sat there and watched him eat eight chickens
I'm the sickest linguistically, illicit lyrical misfit, in the business
Still ripping, motherfucker listen
Microphone spray, no delay, home and away
I told them yesterday, "No way", I told them today
I heard them say, "The flow is exact, so is the track"
It ain't where you from, it's where you at so why you going back?
Ever since 'HRSMN Talk', I stomp emcees for sport
I rip 'em apart and never been caught
Intelligent thought, aaah, like Masterpiece nigga
Massacre niggas, Mr Masterpiece with the triggers
You can fly away but I'ma get ya, the dogs gonna fetch ya
The Horse gonna put you on the stretcher
Capital letter, H-R-S-M-N
We did it before and now we the best again
