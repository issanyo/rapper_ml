[Intro]
Nigga, eat these nuts
Yeah, know what I'm saying?
Death Row in the motherfucking house
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Rat-tat-tat-tat late at night with my gat
On the streets of LA
Wondering where the pussy at
Straight player, looking for a ho
Hanging out, rolling in my '64
16 switches for the niggas in my hood
17 shells so I make it understood
Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut
You come outside, nigga you getting fucked up
I done told you, creep, creep you best move
Like Luther Vandross, I'm fucking up the west coast
I'm right back up in you when you nut
1-2-3, nothing from the D-R-E but
This is for the hoes that I used to know
When I didn't have my '64 and a lot of dough
I keep it like this and like that and I-

[Hook: Dr. Dre (Snoop Dogg and RBX)]
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, and I
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)
Rat-tat-tat-tat tat ta tat like that, and I
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)
(Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back)

[Verse 2]
Hocus-pocus, here comes the loc'est
Nigga that you know, on Death Row
Dre, the motherfucking docta'
Yeah, with the shit that'll rock ya'
Stop ya', right in your tracks
If you dig 'em, you dug 'em and dig 'em good for a smack, black
Back to the hood, nigga
Where my homies on the corner throwing it up and don't give a fuck
About a cracker jacker with a bag of white
Motherfuckers (?) now I'mma smack 'em
With the grip of that gansta shit
That be humping and bumping Compton
The city I'm from, you can't get none
Try to step up and you'll get done, diddy-done
One fool tried to get with me
He wasn't shit to me
So I had to let Nina go
Ratta tat tat, ta tat tat tat tat
Yeah, niggas better recognize
You ever had a TEC-9 in the middle of your eyes?
I keep it like this and like that and I-

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Creepin' and peepin' and I can get with these
The chronic, slangin' fat ki's from my block
And it don't stop
Tell me where ya wanna go
To the strip
Or take a trip bawlin' with the row
My shit off in ya system attacks
Endo smoke in ya lungs, like that
You get lifted, calm, and if it's da bomb
Taken away like Calgon on Vietnam
California, back and on a mission, makin' a point
Ain't no fuckin' competition
They wishin' but run up on reality
CPT, CAL my locality
It's strange how I re-arrange and change the business
By droppin' shit like this
Dope, niggas can't cope with the real
I peal, penitentiaries still, when I kill

[Hook]
