All my niggas won't you dip with me
All my bitches won't you dip with me
Everybody won't you dip with me
All my bitches won't you dip with me
All my niggas won't you dip with me
All my bitches won't you dip with me
Everybody won't you dip with me
All my bitches won't you dip with meeeee

MCs i assassinate
Don't play no games
Don't procrastonate
Got my homeboy slip
Playing rubber with tha clip
Ready to slap a bitch and
Poppin off at the lip
What you want somethin
Get my gauge and pop somethin
Quick to pull out
Pop and i pop somethin

Wanna know about tha gang
Actin like yall niggas ain't really knew our name
Nigga you see we gangstaz

Gettin niggas through tha dark 'n all
See 'em all runnin through tha park 'n all
Give a f**k homeboy coz we sparks it off
I'm a raw dogg assassin from tha DPG
And i be one of tha freshest and dopest MC
When you catch us in tha cut
And you lookin like what
Best believe it be Daz and that nigga kurupt
We got it all locked down
Coz you ain't hittin no more
Washed up what tha f**k
You ain't eatin no more
The radical traumatical assassin
Got his ass kicked
The motherf**kin bastard stretched like elastic
Now you bein' a hazard
Two gats tha game
Ran slap dead into a train motherf**ker
And gettin bitches like an everyday thang
D O double G
P O U N D it's tha gang

(chorus)
All my niggas won't you dip with me
All my bitchez won't you dip with me
Everybody won't you dip with me
All my bitches won't you dip with me
All my niggas won't you dip with me
All my bitches won't you dip with me
Everybody won't you dip with me
All my bitchez won't you dip with me

(Kurupt)
Skedaddle
MCs on these terrains
Terrorist pterodactyl overlooking tha plains
Off of propane flames
Stickin niggas
Perapeutic poetical and therapeutic
MCs pulverised punished and executed
Don't say i shoot
Homeboy shoot it
Y'up against a grizzly
'cause McKenzie
I'm on a frenzy
Ain't nothin fun and friendly
I'm headin to where you're friends be
Yeah motherf**ker
Ya wanna bust it in off ya head motherf**ker
Ya heard what i said motherf**ker
Yeah Kurupt what tha f**k
Kidnap and abduct (check it out)
Niggas like you don't make it over hear
Where it's all about your heart and tha clothes you wear
I moved out this bitch at tha age of 16
Got my first M16 at 18
First thing i knew was 11-8 gangstaz
And don't you know 'bout tha 6-0's
Y'ever got quoted?
Well i did nigga put it on bark and heart foam
In this land we in homie it's all about stripes
That fool thinkin a nigga settle down
With kids and a wife
F**k a bitch homie
My homeboy I warn you
You can't be goin on to California
They'll call tha cops on ya
Born in tha illy philly philadel' (shh)
Went from shell toe and deeps
To heat and canded shell
Went from rhyming on tha block
To mini-macs and nots
To max tha tops mini-mac 11s and Glocks
Motherf**k wit me

(chorus)
(RBX)
Ha ha ha ha
Dip with me into a world full of gang bang and dope
Sales
Where niggas get they cap pushed back
To tha fact common as a cold
Anyone contesting will catch the grand reprisal
Murder
No mercy
No remorse
Anybody killa
All day everyday without delay
Red or blue
It don't matter
When tha hot blood splatter
People see more
For you filled with gray matter
Brainwaves everyway
We murder and end things
And recognise that we come again and again and again
Energize in tha spot like a duracell bunny
Hop to this
Hear me now
Continue to ride
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
How you say ride
Ride with us indeed
Or get murdered
