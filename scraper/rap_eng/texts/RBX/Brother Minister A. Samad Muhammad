[Brother Minister A. Samad Muhammad]
Black men, you must make a decision; and black women, you must make a decision. And there's only two decisions. Either you choose life, or you choose death. Either you choose life, or you choose death. Based on the decision that you make, God has come and offered you life. Your enemy can only offer you death.If you choose to stay with your enemy, you choose death. If you choose to leave the enemy and strike out into the unknown, into the unknown, into the unknown
