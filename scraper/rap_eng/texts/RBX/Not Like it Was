* Snoop Dogg, Soopafly, E. White & RBX

Tell it like it is, is
And not like it was

[Chorus]
Telling it like it is, is
And not like it was
Telling it like it is, is
And not like it was

[Snoop Dogg]
I give a pound to my man with my right hand
I roll a blunt with my left hand
Give it to the best man
Testing, testing one-two
Do you hear what I'm talkin' bout
Am I comin' through (come on)
Big Snoopy sky sushi
Don't fuck wit' a broad
Unless she kickin' in the koochie
Like the big homie Moochie
He say sport Snoop Dogg Clothing
Fuck Gucci
I gotta keep it true see
A lotta niggas talk shit but won't do shit to me
Catch me on the streets
Or catch me in the club
Or catch me on the screen
Or catch me if you can
Or catch me wit' a hundred thousand in my hand
Catch me chillin' in a C-boy stance
Or hangin' in the hood doin' a C-Walk dance

[Chorus]
Telling it like it is, is
And not like it was
Telling it like it is, is
And not like it was

[Soopafly]
Yeah, uh huh
C'mon
Yeah
Well okay
Now let me break it down for ya
Tell ya how it went
I'ma really tell ya why these bitches ain't shit
I let a hoe get close and didn't watch close
All up in my house though
I was diggin' out, yeah
Baby wanted to feel with Soopa really all about (hm)
How I'm livin' good and other niggas in a drought (hm)
How I got these niggas feelin' like they wanna shout (hm)
How I get my cap out my six-four, bounce
How I'm fresh, clean with eleven hoes on my team
Runnin' they thoughts and runnin' most of they dreams
Sometimes call me daddy
Sometimes king
Hold my thing
Don't fuck wit' my rings
Keep my makeup off them jeans

[Chorus]
Telling it like it is, is
And not like it was

[E. White]
I stay holdin' my nuts in
Runnin' my trap in
Showin' these sluts whats happening
Oh yeah I used to get wet up
Throw a set up
Act loud all night wouldn't shut up
But I'm high with the Dogg, nigga what up
And that's the homie Soopafly muthafucker
Somethin' I been wantin' to say to y'all niggas
That's speak on me and the homies that roll wit' us
Some real hard hitters
We live in churches and so we keep God wit' us
We got the narrator R wit' us
And the home boy Kokane oh boy it's on again, come on

[Chorus]
Telling it like it is, is
And not like it was
Telling it like it is, is
And not like it was

[RBX]
Narrator hit 'em wit the flash blood flow
Bitch nigga drown in the undertow
We chop the spot like thunder though
Bitch niggas step in will blunder bro
Let me tell y'all how it really is
X down with Snoop it ain't no quiz
From me Aaliyah mo' thicker than water
Once missiles are launched mo' quicker the slaughter
Bloody murder
Got to do it, strike back with a vengeance, thought y'all knew it
In the past tense, done did it
Catch you slip in the club you done shit it
Admit it, we blaze a trail
Without us on your team you'll fail
Me 'n' Soopa doop, my nigga E-White
Wit Kokane 'n' Snoop
Bitches jock all night
We gang-bang

[Chorus]
Telling it like it is, is
And not like it was
Telling it like it is, is
And not like it was
