[Intro: RBX + Woman]
All units: code four. Suspect's wearing a black leather jacket, black boots, carrying a nunchuck—with a possible gun
Boom, nigga! Right back at ya
What the fuck you thought, nigga?
Come to Long Beach and get yo' motherfuckin ass caught
Put in the crosshair, and that's for real, nigga
And that's how we do shit, nigga
You better, ask some-motherfucking-body

[Hook]
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
As night prepares yo' mind to sleep
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
You in a chronic haze and fall asleep
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
And when you wake up you don't know where you at
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
Uh-huh.. this is Long Beach (MUR-DER)

[Verse]
Now let's get down to the nitty gritty
Mood is shitty, no pity
Long Beach is the city
Since I'm from Long Beach, I got to put in work
And no, this ain't Compton and Long Beach together;
Strictly Long Beach
Listen to me preach
Anybody killa? Mass murder! (Bombs Detonate)
That was the sound of my double-barreled shotgun
And there is no place to run
So if you're thinkin' 'bout comin' to Long Beach
Chip in, bullets will be zippin'
Zappin', bodies collapsin'
Killa beats; then I put the raps in
It's on, it's on, it's on, and
We can bust a cap 'til the break of dawn
So, now that you heard the warning
I welcome you with open arms
Open fire arms (Gunshots)
And we don't give a fuck about cars with alarms
It's a jack move, nigga, give it up, is you crazy?
Glock .40 pointed to your head
Boom, now another nigga's dead
Bloody murder

[Hook]
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
Murder
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
Bloody murder
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
Murder
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
Bloody murder
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
Murder
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
Bloody murder
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
Murder
Slip into some fucked up shit with me
Bloody murder

[Outro: Police Officers]
