My brothers, my brothers
My god, my god

[Verse 1: RBX]
The united new front
But the madness staff
And I am the narrator
Reality born X
Laying in a field baffled and perplexed
Once again the power of the X
Wondering will this war come before I am ready?
It is time load the weapon
This is the doormat to the funky format
Now step in, slam the door, hit the lock
Let me manifest the words of a rock
It's not Gibraltar
Step to this you will falter
I stand on the alter
Bringing my, slinging my, stingin' my [?]
When I'm runnin' my fly words of wisdom
That your mental capacity might not capacitate
One, one is the sun
The sun is the black man
He is I, I am him
Them, them witches they tried to stand in my way
Malik load the AK
Another clip is empty, quickly [?]
Word to brother
He hand me another
Meanwhile, the helicopters hover
Devils shoot around, down I duck, then Malik is dropped
King is gone
Word is bond no time to mourn, I move on
Mission, not to get torn
Then, I am also hit
In the distance, they have a bodybag
Hell no G, I can't go that route
I'll fight the pain
'Cause I can't sell the hell out
But war is on
So I lick my wounds and step, my mouth is bloody
'Cause my wounds were open wide
But my mental helps me keep stride
3, 4, 3, 4
Suddenly the sounds of gun roar
The allies, some break in the sun
Devils [?], you can't run from armageddon

[Hook]
We gotta go
Back to Akebulan
We gotta get
Back to Akebulan
We're on our way
Back to Akebulan
Our people made
Back to Ganjah K

[Verse 2: Ganjah K]
Behead the [?] with guillotines
Machine guns for the [?]
Welcome to the scene
Pandamonia' in Babalonia
Blacks reign supreme, I mean
Knowing it's [?]
Niggas finally became a team
