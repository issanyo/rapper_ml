(Ready, ready now)

[Hook: Bishop Lamont]
Nigga, we born
Then nigga, we die
Whatever happens in between is up to you and I
I can't tell you what heaven is like
'Cause all I know is it's been hell to live this fuckin' life

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 1: Bishop Lamont]
You gassed up [?]
It's very flammable, especially when one spark is all it takes
For heaven's sakes
When more niggas learn
Hopefully sooner than [?]
And with the word God select [?]
But it's really hard to see when you live perpetual night
And when that Bible's too thick
But that money roll is thicker
To pass on that you'd be a stupid ass nigga
But what you did to get that makes you a stupid ass nigga
Guess we damned if we do
Double-damned if we don't
Remember there's always a nigga that will
When yo' ass won't
Believe me
[?]

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
We was all born dyin'
Born alone, die alone
I'm home sweet home in my catacomb
When I die turn your lighters on
I make a loudmouth tone turn softer than a xylophone
Yeah, bust it open bitch, daddy home
[?] zip lines, duct tape, chloroform
Classically trained in the art of war
Then I bang a whore in a figure four
[?] endorphins
[?]
I turn you to a headless horseman, I'm priceless
Some niggas turn to Christ when they facing crisis
I ain't afraid of death, live it until I'm lifeless, yeah

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: RBX]
Crazy how life seems to bleed into death
Like graffiti on the wall that you read like [?]
Helter skelter, catch wreck like [?]
[?]
[?] screamin' "I hate that muthafucka"
But the [?] right past the sucka
Thief in the night might be the shadow taker
A glimpse of the sun brings off the widowmaker
I hear them little baboons throwin' they little turds
But I move right past it
Don't give 'em the words
Silence is golden
[?]
Like a Hitchcock movie
[?]

[Hook x2]

Eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
How you live and die
That's up to you

Eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
How you live and die
That's up to you

Live by the sword
Die by the sword
Live by the gun
Die by the gun

And as I
Walk the valleys
In shadows of death
I shall fear no evil... none
[?]
And there you have it
Life... or death
Which do you choose?
(Laughter)
