Brothers and Sisters
We are in the final days
And we must have black unity now or else

In the distance echoing
Horns from the freedom train starting to blow
The door moves slow
With a quickness dash to get your mental
Now I'm dashing, clashing with the thoughts
I used to have. It's time for math
Lets add and divide to get the ones that glide
Now it's time to subtract
I pledge allegiance to only the black
Take me to war for that
Remember it's God you'll be fighting
I am light with words my third eye spread wings
To fly like birds
That's when I spotted your plan
Remember I am black man, the first man
And sooner than later I shall be the last
I will survive your blast
My mental when walk when your physical's ash
I am Sun

Lords of Light!
There was an eclipse of the sun
This eclipse was unlike any other
It rained but the ground was not wet
The very next day the sun does not set
Crash! now there's blood on the moon
Flash! the first seal came soon
I step onto my patio to view the glare
And the air was of a lukewarm texture
I am calm, there's no time to be tense
To be reflective prepare
To get back to the essense
Suddenly I am greeted by a hand
It is Malcolm X the X is now known
I am walked with then I am shown
It is time, now I see the light on the chrome
And I don't need no sunglasses
No more lessons and no more classes I'm there
You had best prepare for the coming of all
When the smoke clears I'll stand tall
Look at you devil now you're sweating
I'm telling you, you can't run
From the hand of Armageddon

So now you dare to harm my physical
With your chemical warfare
The beast don't care
That's why he eats his pig steak rare
So he can taste the blood
Like a bitch trying to feast on a plug
Get ready to attack
No sweating as we march to armageddon
March! all the black hut-2-3-4
March! all the black hut-2-3-4
March! for the time is now
Sooner than later the devil shall bow
I will witness this
Red black and green with a tight fist
I dream of the day when all the blacks
Sit down to chill and unite as one
