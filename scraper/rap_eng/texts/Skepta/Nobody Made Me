[Verse 1]
See I used to think like you
So to diss you wouldn't be fair
But at the same time if I listen
To what you tell me I wouldn't be here
Shit turns to gold when I touch it
So me looking at YouTube comments is counter-productive
Cos none of that criticism is constructive
So I switch off the Mac like fuck this
You're never gonna see me switching
Another Twitter account with no pic
10 followers, following everybody he's dissing
I found myself now I'm missing
They love the grime flow I'm spitting
I took it to the chart now they're listening
I can't wait till I'm on tour I'm itching
Make some noise
Somebody tell Will Smith I am legend
What d'ya know about looking in the fridge
And all you can see is a white light like heaven
When I was young I used to beg mum for some money to buy a birthday present
And now parents want to book me for a sweet 16
I'm a birthday present

[Hook]
They didn't want to rate me
But all my supporters came together and saved me
Tears in my eyes
Head high, pointing to the sky
Screaming nobody made me, nobody made me

[Verse 2]
Put your hands in the air
For the grime MC of the year
Some say I came out of nowhere
Little d'they know it's been a four year nightmare
Running around with no runner
Had to pay for my own radio plugger
Watched everybody eating
While I sat there with no bread, no butter
I told myself I gotta do this
Whatever the weather I get through this
Long as I keep making the hits
My distributors gotta move them units
So I never gave up hoping, naa
Forget crying and sulking
They said I was too grimey
Now me and P. Diddy
On the iChat laughing and joking
Make some noise
And I hope all you A and R's heard that
I got so much more that I wanna say
But I'm looking forward I can't turn back
Remember it's Boy Better Know all year
From October to September
We built this ourselves
So the only man that can ever knock me down is Skepta

[Hook]
