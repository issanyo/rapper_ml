[Intro: Drake, Skepta & Lil Juice]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!
Yeah, yeah (ooh)
BBK, OTB, OVO 2018

[Chorus 1: Skepta]
Two skengs in the ride, stay alive, stay alive
This ain't fucking halftime, why these niggas switchin' sides
Oh well, shit happens, life's a bitch and then you die
Every day these french fries talkin' like they're supersize
You lookin' into my eyes and I can see you're horrified
'Cause no we do not mind commiting homicide
You disrespect my niggas that's when I put my job aside
Don't talk about pulling triggers, you pussy holes ain't qualified

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Yeah, I put my life on the line, man
See I gotta die man, don't you even try, man
Enemies gon' bleed, once I let these bullets fly, man
Mama's gonna cry, man, I like to get motherfuckin' high
Man, you're not the guy, man
See me runnin' around the stage draggin' around a mic stand
Shout my nigga Greatness Dex, that's my fucking right hand
Thousand diamonds in my mouth, I'm the fucking Iceman
And you know I came in with the shhh!

[Chorus 2: Skepta]
Lukey World, free the guys, stay alive, stay alive
This ain't fucking halftime, why these niggas switchin' sides
Oh well, shit happens, life's a bitch and then you die
Every day these french fries talkin' like they supersize
You lookin' into my eyes and I can see you're horrified
'Cause no we do not mind committing homicide
You disrespect my niggas that's when I put my job aside
Don't talk about pulling triggers, you pussy holes ain't qualified

[Verse 2: Suspect]
Who's that nigga? (hey) Wooly Road hitters
Smoke on deck, heat on simmer
Ay, stay alive, stay alive (stay alive)
Stick on me right now, Skep I lie?
Think I'm just a rapper, they like "Suspect is the guy"
'Cause they won't be expectin' it when we make gutter slide
Catch you pussy niggas by surprise
Niggas talkin' wet, now the wet is in his eye
Who am I? I get around, man, sicko with the pow, man
Reppin' for the South but, Wooly hood, my town man
Know how man get down, man
Hey, I built this shit right off the ground, man

[Chorus 1: Skepta]
Two skengs in the ride, stay alive, stay alive
This ain't fucking halftime, why these niggas switchin' sides
Oh well, shit happens, life's a bitch and then you die
Every day these french fries talkin' like they supersize
You lookin' into my eyes and I can see you're horrified
'Cause no we do not mind committing homicide
You disrespect my niggas that's when I put my job aside
Don't talk about pulling triggers, you pussy hoes ain't qualified
