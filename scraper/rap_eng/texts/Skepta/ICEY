[Verse 1: Skepta]
You see us in the streets
My ears are burning, I hear you talking your greaze
BB got the lemon, you don't want him to squeeze
[?] got the lemons, mixing it with the cheese
Stupid fucking laws, got me thinking evil
Somebody pass me the raws, let me smoke this sour diesel
Ain't making no tax on it so they say it's illegal
But still they're serving alcohol and it's killing all these people
Still

[Hook]
Me and my gang stay icey, super gassed
Always got a bag full of weed, plastic cup full of yak
I tell a man don't look no further boy better know where the talent's at
Trying to get the championship belt off yardy, pussyhole good luck with that
Cause

[Bridge]
Me and my gang stay icey
Me and my gang stay icey

[Verse 2: Skepta]
They say I'm the truth
I don't wanna talk to police so I don't roll with any dickhead youts
Can't open the glove compartment got a bag full about 14 zoots
Can't open the Charlie Sloth cause Lukey's got that fire in the booth
But we ain't tryna cause no trouble, ain't tryna commit no crimes
I told her if you wanna see a sick show better come see one of mine
As soon as I drop Ace Hood Flow everybody knows it's moshpit time
Feds didn't want to let me in the O2 so I told Megaman yo fuck this swine

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Skepta]
24/7 I'm with my people
Screaming good over evil
Ain't no tag alongs in my car only my everyday Gs in the vehicle
Everybody swag on a million
I'm killing 'em
Still stopping in the street to take selfies with civilians
They love me like Kate loves William
Niggas on the other side acting bad, I'm high listening to MJ in the limo
Tell a man go on then call your dad, cause I know your dad Will S like Willow
[?] give [?] the vodka watch that creep on a man just like a black widow
It's 4.a.m still out trying to see my pillow

[Hook]
