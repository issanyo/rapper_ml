[Intro]
Right now we're on the streets
Hold tight Angry, hold tight Ramboss
Hold tight Azzy, hold tight Jammer
Hold tight Jme, Wiley, the whole family tree
Bang out

[Verse 1]
It's a well known fact that I've got sick flows
When I come around, everybody knows
Index finger under my nose, when I MC my eyes automatically close
And I wear clean clothes
If I see a camera, do a little pose
Flows, I must be the master of those
So my lyricbook never gets seen like toes
Every two weeks, my hair gets knotty
Might see me in the barbers in Totty
It's Skepta the African hottie
They don't wanna see me switch and turn back into Scotty
With the scores and the shotty
Bullets start singing just like Pavarotti
I love Ja but I ain't Irv Gotti
Yeah I love Ja but I ain't Irv Gotti

[Chorus]
You're not a bad boy in your ends
I keep on telling them over and over again
If I draw for the new skeng
I'll make the top shotter in your ends look like a speng
You're not a bad boy in your ends
I keep on telling them over and over again
If I draw for the new skeng
I'll make the top shotter in your ends look like a speng

[Verse 2]
I've got big tunes, got big bars
Got better bars than your favourite stars
I heard man saying "Go on then" in cars
You little eediat I got bars
Make Nigerians proud of their tribal scars
My bars make you push up your chest like bras
Your bars could never test my bars
New bars, war bars or your old bars
Listen and learn, I predicted I would be a big MC by end of school term
I'm a big bird, you're just a worm
You don't wanna receive third degree burns
When I buss gun everybody spread like germ
Bullets will burn your forehead like a perm
Fuck jailhouse I don't wanna go there
I got a big boy solicitor, case is adjourned

[Chorus]
You're not a bad boy in your ends
I keep on telling them over and over again
If I draw for the new skeng
I'll make the top shotter in your ends look like a speng
You're not a bad boy in your ends
I keep on telling them over and over again
If I draw for the new skeng
I'll make the top shotter in your ends look like a speng

[Verse 3]
Don't talk to me about karate
I will come to your birthday party
Shank anyone I see taking Charlie
Onto the beef like a soldier from the Iraqi, I'm with the Roll Deep army
My name's Skepta, but when I see them pub guys they try call me Darkie
But I fight for my right like Marcus Garvey
Because I wanna make P's like Diddy
So don't come around acting silly
Cause when you see me drawing for the 9 milli
I'll make a man say "Ohhh my diddy!"
You'll get smoked like Philly
Think that you're big but you're just a likkle willy
I load magazines like Chantelle Fiddy
Yeaahhh, ohh my diddy

[Chorus x2]
You're not a bad boy in your ends
I keep on telling them over and over again
If I draw for the new skeng
I'll make the top shotter in your ends look like a speng
You're not a bad boy in your ends
I keep on telling them over and over again
If I draw for the new skeng
I'll make the top shotter in your ends look like a speng
