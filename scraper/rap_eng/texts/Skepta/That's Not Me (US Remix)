[Intro: Skepta]
What do you mean, what do you mean?
Yeah, Skepta
One line flows yeah I got some of those
Easy!
Nah!

[Hook: Skepta]
Nah, that's not me
Act like a wasteman? That's not me
Sex any girl? Nah that's not me
Lips any girl? Nah that's not me
Yeah, I used to wear Gucci
Put it all in the bin cause that's not me
True, I used to look like you
But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me

[Verse 1: Skepta]
It's the return of the mack
I'm still alive just like 2Pac
Girls in the front row, girls in the back
Spit one lyric everybody's like brap
Flashback to the cold nights in the trap
Now I'm in a new whip counting the big stack
Yellow-gold chains and the diamonds are black
Jack me? Nah you don't wanna do that
Anytime you see me wearing a glove
Boy Better Know I ain't coming to fight like Jet Li
Spray this till the clip is empty
I know you get what I'm saying, get me?
Love for the Gs in the ends
We don't love no girls in the ends
Last time I fell in love with a sket
But trust me, I will never do that again

[Hook: Skepta]
Nah, that's not me
Act like a wasteman? That's not me
Sex any girl? Nah that's not me
Lips any girl? Nah that's not me
Yeah, I used to wear LV
Put it all in the bin cause that's not me
True, I used to look like you
But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me

[Verse 2: Wiki]
That club shit, that's not me
Four pack dutches that's not me
Wanna war right now 'til I run up with a P
Old pound nigga gonna kill a MC
All whackjobs, see
[???]
Gonna jack with a Mac you see
Y'all cats can't scat with me
Gotta pass they ass with me
The rats in you ain't scratching me
Touching me
Passin' me
I remember throwing smoke bombs at Fashion Week
Act like a wasteman, yeah, that's me
Get bugged out to the point I can't see
I can't stand, IC3, IC4
I see you're a whore
That's not me
Moms, you don't need to fix my teeth
'Cus my bitch love me just the way that I am right now
So nah, nah, that's not me
Cool guy shit, nah, that's not me
Too live shit, yeah yeah, that's me
Who shot ya, nah that's not me
Smoke 'til the day end just to get me free

[Hook: Skepta]
Nah, that's not me
Act like a wasteman? That's not me
Sex any girl? Nah that's not me
Lips any girl? Nah that's not me
Yeah, I used to wear Gucci
Put it all in the bin cause that's not me
True, I used to look like you
But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me
