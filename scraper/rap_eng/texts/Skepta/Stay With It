[Chorus: Skepta] x2
I stay with it
Too many pussyholes carrying weapons
I'm so icy, man wanna pree me 24/7
Man have got Megaman queffers
Man'll get dropped in 21 seconds
Still I got tings in the whip like
When will I ever learn my lesson
Stay with it

[Verse 1: Shailan]
You know I stay with it
So you better not be trippin'
From a young age been different
Tunnel vision on my mission
Sk's when I'm steppin
Meridian's what I'm reppin'
My nigga Lukey told me no doubt one day you'll get it (Lukey World)
All this pain
Been fuckin with my brain
Open up my third eye
I don't know why we're not the same
Tryna jump on my wave
You might sink just like a drain
Moving fake, big mistake
That's how niggas get erased

[Chorus: Skepta] x2
I stay with it
Too many pussyholes carrying weapons
I'm so icy, man wanna pree me 24/7
Man have got Megaman queffers
Man'll get dropped in 21 seconds
Still I got tings in the whip like
When will I ever learn my lesson
Stay with it

[Verse 2: Suspect]
Too many pussies carrying weapons (Too many pussies)
Too many neeks talking reckless
I hope they projected all them stretchers
Hella stitches and dentures
Fucking with we
Pussy gon' learn some lessons (Ay)
That's why they had to let me out the damn box
For the trap boys, I'm the mascot
Two waps, one Glock what you know about banging?
Man so active, by mistake they found a pair of latex in the glove box
We're just pulling up to Lovebox

[Chorus: Skepta] x2
I stay with it
Too many pussyholes carrying weapons
I'm so icy, man wanna pree me 24/7
Man have got Megaman queffers
Man'll get dropped in 21 seconds
Still I got tings in the whip like
When will I ever learn my lesson
Stay with it

[Skepta]
All this love and money, man's shining
Lukey World, I've been grinding
Spittin my lyrics, I've been writing
And I don't act my age, I'm on a hype ting (Greaze)
And on the dance floor we ain't hiding
Walk on water, man's gliding
Like R. Kelly, man's flying
Don Julio with some ice in
Tell the bouncers to 'low me
I bought mum and dad a house each
I got black diamonds in my mouthpiece
Might see my niggas on South Beach
With some model tings and some loud weed
And I keep them problem solvers around me

[Chorus: Skepta] x2
I stay with it
Too many pussyholes carrying weapons
I'm so icy, man wanna pree me 24/7
Man have got Megaman queffers
Man'll get dropped in 21 seconds
Still I got tings in the whip like
When will I ever learn my lesson
Stay with it
