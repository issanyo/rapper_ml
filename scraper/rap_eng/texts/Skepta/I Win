(Go on then, go on then)
(Pow, Pow)
I win, don't want to see me shining, I win
You don't want it on a mic ting, I win
Your girl watching my ting, I win
Everyday I go in, I win
See the diamond in my ring, I win
That's a diamond for a king
Don't know why MCs want to try a ting
When you know all you're gonna get is a murking

[Verse 1: Lethal Bizzle]
Yo, yo, it's all switched up now
The real dons are the main fixture, wow
Soon as you hear "It's Lethal da Bizzle records"
Next thing you know you're gonna hear is "Pow"
Manna kings, and you know we don't follow
Someone touch our ting, nah don't bother
Yeah I'm a scholar, X3 shotter
Man's been winning since ching chang walla
Yeah, now we step it up another gear
Still hungry like it was the first year
Sixteen, I was off the hook this year
Doing in artists, really, 'cause I had no fear
Look, can you keep up? (keep up?)
Still, riddims gonna get beat up (beat up)
No time to put your feet up (feet up)
You hesitate, us man'a clean up

[Verse 2: Skepta]
What have you actually done?
Apart from be forced to sell drugs and hold a gun
Now you're talking like it's fun
Said that you've made it, blud let me ask your mum
Chasing dough, that's why you get none
You man are washed up, that's why you get spun
Mumsy said she's done having kids
She see me on TV, now she want a next son
But she knows that I'm gonna be who I wanna be
See me online, like they wanna follow me
Sippin' Champagne, sitting in economy
'Cause I'm always in the sky, no astronomy (nice)
That's why them man are upset
See your wifey, now she wanna undress
I'm a different breed, say it how it is 'til death
And we are the last ones left

[Hook: Skepta & Lethal Bizzle]
I win, don't want to see me shining, I win

[Verse 3: Skepta & Lethal Bizzle]
(Yeah, ah)
Yeah, yeah man are first place, no less
I aim for the head while you aim for the chest
One, two, one, two showerman man a pass through
Ten reloads man are spraying on the set
Like 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6
How you gonna catch me while I'm in Heathrow?
See your girl, yeah she give me deep throat
Pull up in your ends like I was Deebo
(Greaze!)

[Interlude]
