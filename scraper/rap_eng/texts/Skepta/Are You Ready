[Verse 1: Skepta]
Hmm, wow, yeah...always ready
The black Nigerian's way to heavy
Every time I open my mouth look
I say a lyric and another MC gets buried
Yeah 6 feet under
Leave a hole in your jumper
When the big skeng rings out like a private number
Ring ring, talk to the answer machine
Yo Frisco pass the machine
I just wanna do my part for the scene
I'm a big man but they wanna see me act like I'm 15
Na fam it's a big man ting so please stop watching the whip man's in
I don't wanna be no funky house DJ
But they got me on a wig man ting

[Hook: Wiley]
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
I seen so much now I don't give a monkeys
Swing from tree to tree just like monkeys

[Verse 2: Skepta]
So man wanna war me, record me
Lights camera action
Who produces anthem after anthem? (Me)
Skepta, The Microphone Champion
Some people can't see that you can't win a lyrical war with me
So I'm gonna call this one Lord of the Mics, Part 3
And murder another 25 MCs
So dig me a larger grave
Spray my ting like aftershave
It's gonna be a par today
When your heartbeat stops and you pass away
Trust me it's all easy to me
I'm champagne, you're Lambrini to me
Dunno why you're talking greazy to me
When I'm Rodney Price, you're Beenie to me

[Hook: Wiley]
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
I seen so much now I don't give a monkeys
Swing from tree to tree just like monkeys

[Verse 3: Skepta]
They wanna run it up
But like Armour said
It's nothing leave them
Bare skeng talk I can't believe them
Red and white R6 I'll leave them
Ed Hardy glasses I can't see them
So why you talking like you can't die
One bullet in each lung breath then
See your sounding weezy
And I heard your CD
You and your mandem are talking greezy
I just tell a man like D-E-E
Come On Come On
Do you really think I give 2 shits if you're greezy?
I don't think so
You man ain't seen greezy yet
All my mandem pop it off
Your man will fly off into the sky like easyJet

[Hook: Wiley]
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
You can't threaten me with no badman talk I'm not scared sorry man
I seen so much now I don't give a monkeys
Swing from tree to tree just like monkeys
