[Chorus: Esco]
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man, man
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars, two cars
Two straps, two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man, man
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars, two cars
Two straps, two straps

[Verse 1: Skepta]
First of all rest in peace Esco
Sitting here with my head in my hands thinking to myself where do all the dead go
We gotta go anytime, God says so
'Till then I'ma get this paper, look after my fam no time for a hater
Little bit of Hennessy with a chaser, pour a little for my G's in the graveyard
I'm tipsy and now I'm off to do a show, at a club in an area that I don't really know
Phoned my G like, 'Wagwan yo?'
Two cars, both with two straps let's go
When I roll out, gotta roll out properly
Too many man wanna get a stripe off me
But I move too digital, dem niggas move sideways like quarter past three

[Chorus: Esco]
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man, man
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars, two cars
Two straps, two straps

[Verse 2: Chronik]
Two cars, roll with two man with two straps
Athletes run, we shoot bats
Man can't look over the boot of the car, I shoot hats
You're just there at your window dancing, I shoot flats
Back the MAC, blud move back
Blud aim fire, I don't know about talk
He was my friend from school, I don't know about four
Cuh when I roll with the darg, no leash, no muzzle
Burst you in your face, who wants trouble?

[Chorus: Esco]
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man, man
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars, two cars
Two straps, two straps

[Verse 3: D Double E]
That's the risk that I'm willing to take, driving late when I'm carrying weight
That's the risk that I'm willing to take, I will draw for the leng to defend my mate
Draw for the leng to defend my friend, (buss it!) Just tell me when (buss it!)
Don't have to tell me again, I don't need ten men the beef will get end with the leng
Make the news at ten, when it comes to the beef I'm ready to defend
If it come down to it, I don't want to but I will go through it
If the mandem push me to do it then
Headtop blud, I'll put a bullet straight through it cause I'm on this ting blud
What you never knew it? On this ting blud, what you never knew it?
I will pursue it

[Chorus: Esco]
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man, man
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars, two cars
Two straps, two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man, man
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars both with two man with two straps
Two cars, two cars
Two straps, two straps
