[Verse 1: Frisco]
Boy Better Know we got the place in a frenzy
You coming against my team is long and it don't make sense like a friendly
So I done a guy quick like out in a Henry

Yeah I got nought point four for a twenty
And I'm back in the lab, what'd you know about rinsing straps till the whole clips empty
I know nuff man wanna exempt me
But you cannot prevent me
I ain't going nowhere so you better accept me

[Chorus: Skepta & Frisco]
Yo I dare one of these MCs try chat to me bad

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Boy Better Know, it's money making season
Book a flight to New York for no reason
Niggas wanna buy a CD, I'm selling it
Go to the radio, give out the phone line number
Niggas in Brooklyn are bellin' it
The grime sound, I'm spreading it
I know I've got a big head in it
You better mind I don't come to your show and Hot 97 it
We can do it London stylie and Rinse it
Fuck it we can FM 96.6 it
Maximum don't mix it
I wanna break them up so bad not even Jimmy could fix it
So you can stir it and whisk it
I'll start spitting out fire like a .38 biscuit
I don't know why they wanna try clash this showerman, not even Rooney would risk it

[Chorus: Skepta & Frisco]
So I dare one of these MCs try chat to me bad
And get Boy Better Know mad
Yeah I'm old school like bumping a cab

Yo I dare one of these MCs try chat to me bad
And get Boy Better Know mad
Yeah I'm old school like bumping a cab
I can easily make a good day turn bad

[Verse 3: Frisco]
What's wrong with this yute, it's on for this yute
Diss me now it's all long for this yute
I ain't gonna blaze him, you won't be able to save him when I drop a bomb on this yute
So carry on talking
You're a prick I ain't seen you win the [?] once with a drive-in, ridin' or walking
Stop stalling
Can't you see that you're already falling, I put my all in
Everybody knows that I've been a skeng MC from morning
Send for your best mic man I will lick that down just call him
Frisco's on a mad one, 45s you ain't had one
What you know about Sidewinder sanctuary letting off bare shots with a handgun
9 mill you ain't banged one

[Chorus: Skepta & Frisco]
Yo I dare one of these MCs try chat to me bad
And get Boy Better Know mad
Yeah I'm old school like bumping a cab
I can easily make a good day turn bad
So I dare one of these MCs try chat to me bad
And get Boy Better Know mad
Yeah I'm old school like bumping a cab
I can easily make a good day turn bad

Yo I dare one of these MCs try chat to me bad
And get Boy Better Know mad
Yeah I'm old school like bumping a cab
I can easily make a good day turn bad
So I dare one of these MCs try chat to me bad
And get Boy Better Know mad
Yeah I'm old school like bumping a cab
I can easily make a good day turn bad

[Outro: Frisco]
