[Verse 1]
I would hate me too
If I had the same MySpace views as you
If I saw Skepta go from sitting on the wall
To sitting in a white V6 coupe
I think I'm the best and I call it competitve confidence, not vanity
It's not my fault them man have got a childish mentality
And they don't know how to make a tune for the mainstream, radio, road man
And the stageshow at the same time
Watch what Too Many Man and Sunglasses at Night do in two double o nine
Let me tell you why I'm the king of grime
You write a hundred million different flows
I write that classical line to last me my whole life time

[Bridge]
No chorus, get me, this one's a zoners
Looking out the window, appreciating being Joseph
And as long as I'm me and you're you..
I'm the best

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't like me either
If I had a flow like yours that left no space for a breather
Then Skepta comes around
With a flow that breaks down
More times then a P reg Vauxhall Tigra
Too book Skepta ain't getting no cheaper
But promoters still want me to feature
Your sitting at home telling yourself the shit weed your smoking is a creeper
It's not creeping
Stop lying to yourself fam you might as well have bought shisha
I'm too real, nobody realer
Too deep, nobody deeper
Flow like Gus, call me the street sweeper

[Bridge]
Danger, madness, all my Boy Better Know family
Do your stuff, don't watch no face
You get me? More money more haters
Everyone's talking, talking, talking
Ah Rolex Sweep, Sunglasses at Night
Them man ain't real, that's a joke ting cuz
Man has never been bad up in the music ting
Them man come out their yard
Put their hoods on, sit behind tinted windows
Call themself road-man
Imagine if I gave them my face for one day
Shit their-self, wouldn't even come out their yard

[Verse 3]
About victim
You think I rap way too fast and you're thinking this grime ting ain't the in ting
But you know what, I hear that killer
But don't mistake me for that nigga
I get mad when I think this ting got me spitting with people like Boya and Saskilla
Look right, It's not what it looks like
I stay with gang live a good life
I used to shot grams on a push bike
But I wasn't a brand name like Suge Knight
I took time I kept a low profile
I had the food that make that cats go wild
Before music I had a booming line
Blud, ask T-Mobile
