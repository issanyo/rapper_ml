[Intro]
Mental, Yeah, Skepta
Big up my nigga Jaykae, Daps, Choppa, Tempa, Depzman, Sox and all the Birmingham G's
Ayy

[Verse 1: Skepta]
I'mma be straight up like let's talk about Lord of the Mics, yeah that was heavy blood
Can't believe I repeated a lyric and Devilman didn't say "said that already blood"
Why you repeating it, I woulda' been finished, out of all my lyrics I spat that twice
Anyway fuck that, talk about me you better hashtag grime
Crowd went mad when I spat that rhyme, everybody went mad when I spat that rhyme
Turned up late, black man time, all black suit and it's Batman time
Think that you're me but you're not that guy, vintage shirt but you're not that fly
Feds seen me on the TV and they're like "Can't believe we never stopped that guy"
2005 when I first shot that 9, I didn't see where the bullet went, but all I know it made my arm go flyin'
Looked at Solo, this guy's shooting and laughing at the same time
I said Solo fam, I won't lie
We ain't gonna buss in this ting if 24/7 us man are on crime
Now I don't need a label budget, no publicity stunts
Number 1 album, entry of the week, never went on the radio once
You better go and get Blacklisted, I tell an MC please don't get it twisted
If I don't call you fam then you better know that it's straight business

[Hook]
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
No bullshit, no lies, its the remix, straight up
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
No bullshit, no lies, its the remix, straight up
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
No bullshit, no lies, its the remix, straight up
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
No bullshit, no lies, its the remix, straight up

[Verse 2: Skepta]
If I was Christian, I would put my hand on the bible
But still on my unborn child, I'mma be straight up like it says in the title
I'mma tell 'em all straight I don't care what big chain you're buying
Don't care what you say, you're lying
I've come to expose, Imma die trying
So if I ain't breaking the record, I'm breaking the vinyl
Let me see if you're really a man,never been to your bredrin's grave
Seen big man cry with his knees in the sand
That's why when them man spit blood, I ain't feelin' a man
Light a big spliff for my G's in the can
Wifey wants to know where I am
Tell her that Iâ€™m with Jaykae smoking Tangerine Dream in Dam
Pull the cheese out, pull it all out
Man are living the dream fuck going back to the trap
I don't wanna pull the 8 ball out
Sellotape on the tonitas (why?) so the batteries don't fall out (mental) Wrappin' up scores thinking about which pussy'oles name do I wanna call out, kill a couple MC's, Man are on tour now
And the crowd is loud as a bitch, I swear this year man smoked over a thousand spliffs
Picked up an ounce of the piff, this spliff I'm smoking was like a baseball bat, now it's shorter than an album skit
And alot of these pricks ain't doing anything for the mandem, that's why they ain't allowed in the bits

[Hook]
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
No bullshit, no lies, its the remix, straight up
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
No bullshit, no lies, its the remix, straight up
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
No bullshit, no lies, its the remix, straight up
Straight up, straight up, straight up, straight up
No bullshit, no lies, its the remix, straight up
