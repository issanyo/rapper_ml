[Verse 2 - JME]

Make me laugh, if you want a t-shirt bruv just ask
If I see any more boy better garms
Ill put on my V for Vendetta mask
And come to your shop and start wrapping up fast
Girl better blow ain't in my class
What, do you think I make t-shirts for these little stupid ragged hoes with no
What you wearing that t-shirt for, tramp
You can get three for a score
At Wembley market you can get four
Some people in girl better blow t-shirts wanna picture
But Iâ€™m too raw
Sorry, no! Your t-shirts poor
Bruv, everybody knows you don't get saw

[Verse 3 - Skepta]

Skepta, Skepta, I wear my own t-shirts
Girls see me in the party and flirt
But I don't tell them 'Shut yer mout'
I tell them 'Well done you found a diamond in the dirt'
Boy Better Know t-shirts, that's my thing
I've got a black one of these, white writing
White one of these with red writing, it's at my house
But you can have this one if you come back to the hotel
Lethal said he's got tees as well
Told him 'Shut your mout, they won't sell
You can't school me about T-shirt P's'
Oi JME, wahgwan for the summer collection?
Boy Better Know tees
I just saw some G-Star RAW tops, they look kinda greaze
Gotta put these other designers on freeze

[Verse 4 - Frisco]

Come to the lab and you can see what's cooking G
You'll see I'm a skeng, I got the peng
That's why the promoters are booking me
Been cold from ages and when it comes to bars I got pages
So any one of these yout think they can take out Fris let a bigger man chat to me then
It's not just hype man I'm actually peng
Pass the pad and I will slap with pen
This year I went Napa on good boy flex
So I wouldn't go back to the pen
I went back to the lab I came back with the peng
I took the peng straight back to the ends
Trust me I'm doing this ting
Manna lyrical skeng gargon to the end

[Verse 5 - Skepta]

I'm the king of grime and I will be for a very long time..
Wow, I'm the king of grime and I will be for a very long time
Cause I go to the rave get a rewind and the second line never sounded like the first line
Wow, I'm the king of grime and I will be for a very long time
Cause I go to the rave get a rewind and the second line never sounded like the first line
There's no introduction needed, I'm disgusting
And I'm even schooling Justin
What, he got rude so I cussed him
He should have noticed, there ain't no schooling Junior, there ain't no schooling Joseph
I'm ready for the war like Rodney and Moses
All I need is one sixteen bar, one black car, one casket and some roses
King of grime and I will be for a very long time
Go to the rave get a rewind and the second line never sounded like the first line
Wow, I'm the king of grime and I will be for a very long time
Cause I go to the rave get a rewind and the second line never sounded like the first line

[Verse 6 - JME]

If I get, if I get, if I get famous, you'll still see me
I go forward right by 3 3 3
I'm Jamie, don't watch J M E
I do what I want, I'm free free free
Wiley's my bredrin, he's got an album
Gave it to me for free free free
Put it in my PC, track 16
When it got to 3 3 3
I got my lyric book, started barsing
Rhythm set my mind free free free
I'm writing alot, unlikely to stop
Look at the clock blud, 3 3 3
Gonna write more, that's what I'm here for
Give it to you lot for free free free
I'm an angel, I cut the devil in half
I cut him down to 3 3 3

[Verse 7 - Skepta]

Ok, when I said that I would be a king
Man thought I lied, man thought I lied
I said man thought I lied
When I said that I would be a big MC by end of school term
Man thought that I lied
I'm chatting to some girls outside
Screwfacing a couple boys outside
No I didn't have to skeng on me but could have got
A little kick outside
Chatting to the girls outside
I'm chatting to a couple girls outside and when I said that I would be a big MC by end of school term

[Verse 8 - Frisco]

I said man better cool, relax and just chill out
Everybody knows when big Frisco touch the microphone it's big bars that'll spill out
I've been here from day and I'm still out
You're not big out, flows will get kill out
I'm still waiting for Ace and Vis to holla at the kid to feature on Ill Out
It's all good like I said just chill out
Ca when i'm raving, i'm champagneing
Man will bop to the bar, easy i'll pop a bill out
When I see a night out the bunch I stick out
You know Boy Better Know is the best thing out
You best wing out, when I start bring out
The big boy move, the tunes will get fill out
Stand there and watch your rave get dig out
I spit fire that'll burn mans wig out

[Verse 9 - JME]

Keep hating me because the man at HMV knows JME
I said 'mixtape, mixtape, mixtape'
Yeah you know what I'm talking about, I'm a pisstake
I put out four per annum
While you stay home and watch channel
You watch I'll drop t-shirts and I'm, using them to promote my boys and my bro
Also known as Boy Better Know
Don't know why I told you, you already know
You know them way, you can get fake T's off eBay
Let me explain
Girl Better Blow, Girl Better Know, Girl Better Show
They're all fake
Boy Better Know, if you got them T-shirts right there, you're on your own
I do a lot like ACME
My brain is like an everything factory
I don't beef or clash with anyone
I'm cool so everyone backs me
Sometimes people try to verbally attack me
I spot them like lyrical acne
Then I warrior charge like Scratchy
Yeyeyeyeyeyoyoyoyo
I've got a low battery
I don't care, my bars are catchy
Badman in London like Apache
Serious badman in Napah, jump off the plane, jump in the taxi
Yasoo, rudeboy take me to Napah, Creeks and Daxi
Serious!
