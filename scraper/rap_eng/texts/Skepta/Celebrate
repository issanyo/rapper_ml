[Intro: Skepta]
Skepta, Roll Deep, yeah
E16, N17, E3, SW9, E14, N13
We do this ting
Rules and regulations

[Verse 1: Scratchy]
I've been a scholar since ching chang walla
Real life, not no sci-fi horror
Walk by today, drive-by tomorrow
Talk out, get blazed, why do you bother?
You've been wally since Tim Tam Tommy
Go raves, get paid, but they don't wanna do it proper
Rep my crew Roll Deep, since Ip Dip Do, and I always have something to offer
Brand new clobber, paid top dollar, plus I, ain't no shotter or robber
If you thinking of trying a ting then don't bother, get smacked up today, get smacked up tomorrow
If you wanna take the piss then you're gonna, hear something else holla
See that girl over there, she's mine, I'm on her, so family don't bother

[Hook]
Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the Roll Deep crew, no long ting we regulate that
Non-stop gash, penetrate that, the album went silver, celebrate that
Anybody get rude to the Roll Deep crew, no long ting we regulate that

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yo, my name is Skepta, I'm in Roll Deep but I live in North London so sometimes I don't see them
More time I see Wiley and Max, check Trim, Danny and Scratch, Flow Dan and Karnage on the weekend
Roachee's in jail my nigga, that's why I'm tellin' boydem to free dem
Some man don't know that I'm in Roll Deep, 'cause they never heard me on In At The Deep End
I rep Roll Deep but I'm not from E3
Don't hate me 'cause you see me on the TV
Talk about what you gonna do when you see me
And when you see me you say Skepta, wargwan, easy
That's how I know you ain't greezy
I lick a shot and disappear like a genie
Everybody in the country knows me
I'm a soul survivor like Young Jeezy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Flowdan]
Ok, I don't know what them man are on
Us man are gone, done with the old arguments, had to move on
Dem man are hiding, let them carry on
The studios' built, now nuff more songs
Non stop bars, non stop beats, non stop heat I mean non stop bombs
Non stop cash when I got my gat, too many can't flock that
Become a non stop gonner
I mean non stop acting, non stop tactics, man I practice on your spastics
See, say I topple and iron like lying in a Zion
Check that, deep, dem man are French plastic
Biggin em again them man are just matchsticks
I ain't playin games, them are not match-fit
Although they chat shit, we've been doin dis ting and you can't chuck a ting from this

[Verse 4: Jet Li]
Yeah man
Look, all I wanna do is celebrate, play nice games like chess; checkmate
Separate the rude from the fake, are you one of them?
Real recognize real game that's the bullet and Jet Le that's me I boogie
Come to the dance in a blacked out hoody, leave out the dance with a girl in a mini
When I get come home gonna show her my buddy
Money, funny how it changes the plot, new face on the block, yeah that's a lot
Take times so you take times say please, this country's system ain't designed for me
So I gotta move up how I move off, been through the hard times Heart ache off
Jet be humble but Jet was quick
Celebrate life cause I've only seen a bit
