It's me yo
See me on the TV yo
I know you hear me on the radio
Skepta, I make the crowd go crazy yo
Come again
It's me yo
And I came to party so
Boy Better Know

[Hook x2]
I wanna rock right now
I'm Skepta and I came to get down
I am internationally known
And I'm known to rock a microphone
So let's go, yo

Skepta never stops
I'm number one, yes I'm top of the pops
Greatest hits, yes I make lots and I've got another remix locked in the box
Woo woo, that's the sound of the cops
And I bought so much shopping I killed the shops
Now I'm locked, Ed Hardy down to my socks
Rings and watch all filled with rocks, ow!
S to the K, E to the P, T to the A
Everybody say "Skepta"
Let me hear you say "Skepta"
Come again
S to the K, E to the P, T to the A
Everybody say "Skepta"
Let me hear you say "Skepta"

[Hook x2]

Everybody get ready
I used to want girls, now I've got too many
My album's out now, it's way too heavy
More money, more paper and more belly
Ring ring, that's the sound of the celly
Skepta - I just saw you on the telly
Of course you saw me, everybody said I was dead but I'm still alive like Makaveli
S to the K, E to the P, T to the A
Everybody say "Skepta"
Let me hear you say "Skepta"
Come again
S to the K, E to the P, T to the A
Everybody say "Skepta"
Let me hear you say "Skepta"

[Hook x2]
