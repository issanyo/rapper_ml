It's summertime, so imma be spitting them fire and summer rhymes
So hot you can't touch it like Busta Rhymes
It's fucked when I bust a rhyme, they're so fresh I could've customised
I spit nobody wants to bust a line, 'cause I know man that would bust a nine
And I ain't bluffing or nothing I might just pull up with a bagga man that will drag a man, bin bag a man
In Meridian I roll with the bad boys, Gemini, Marley, K, Skepta and Jme
Outlaw, Albie, CB and the triplets, there's just too much to name b
It's that boy from back in the day, try come against and you'll get a smack in your face
I ain't even got a Mac on my waist, I beef for a second then I'm back in the place

Standard procedures
That's what I said on the tune, in the old school back in the day
But back then, nobody knew, I'll get kick out the estate
But you can't shut me up I ain't dumb, I make tunes everybody likes
Yeah, J-m-e, Boy Better Know that I still pick up the mic
Everybody knows that we take the piss
Boy Better Know we're born to do this
From back in the day I used to say, I've got an angry thirst to quench
In the old school back then, cotch in my yard and spray, everyday
On Fruit Loops, 1.4, me Gemini and Albo Outlaw
