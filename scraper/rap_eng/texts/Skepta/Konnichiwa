[Intro: Fifi Rong]
Lookin' for me?
Konnichiwa
Lookin' for me?
Konnichiwa
Lookin' for me?
Konnichiwa
Konnichiwa

[Hook: Skepta]
By now you should know I hate waitin'
I got no patience
Right now man are tryna get out the matrix
Far from the agents
Tryna stay far from the devil in the red dress
Far from the paigons
Only time man are gonna see me again
Is if I share location

[Verse: Skepta]
Cause when you are talkin' 'bout me online
I was down in the basement
Ex girl said that I'm never at home
So she found a replacement
Said, "You was on the road
But I never seen you when I was out on the pavement"
The police wanna set me up
They wanna take me down to the station
But I can't complain
Soon as I get bored, I jump on the plane
Nothin' ain't changed
Boy better know a man went to the BRITs on a train
Think it's a game
Man shutdown Wireless, then I walked home in the rain
Then we took it back to Africa
Ask Wizkid, I can't explain
Never knew that I was gonna pop
Pop like 5th of November
Tell the President we ain't forgot
Tell the Prime Minister we still remember
Man don't care what colour or gender
Nobody's votin' for your corrupted agenda
Fix up, look sharp when I enter
And talk with respect when you discuss me
A lot of these MCs disgust me
Real talk, you ain't best MC in the country
And if you don't like it then fuck me
Not literally, but fuck me
How many more MCs do I kill
'Till they Realize there's nobody above me?
I killed every song that I touched
And I turned into MC Hammer, they can't touch me
I be killin' it, over 10 years on the road
That's a permanent mark, they can't smudge me
Teachers used to diss me
Now when I touch the road I make history
Tried to assassinate me, but they missed me
You could never blacklist me
Nah, last year man lost a yute and my heart turned cold
Dem man lost Lukey and my heart just froze
Cause when the casket get closed
I'm like really what's the use of these cars and clothes?
If man don't wanna switch up, I'ma go hard on my own

[Hook: Skepta]
By now you should know I hate waitin'
I got no patience
Right now man are tryna get out the matrix
Far from the agents
Tryna stay far from the devil in the red dress
Far from the pagans
Only time man are gonna see me again
Is if I share location
