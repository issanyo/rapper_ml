[Verse 1: Dappy]
Yo I am a rapper slash nang singer song writer
From when i was a younger even up to this day
Man trying to drag me under
What a bumba you know that you can find me i never change my number
I don't mind if these private callers wanna carry on blinging off my line
I'm happy to remind that if there gal
Was to see me on there one's they
Would wanna bang me or give me the shines
I'm a Dappa X white gold chain ripper
Crack pusher man if it need be
Last man to pull his hands on my chain
Found himself in a scarred.. oil greazy (Ni)

[Verse 3: Fazer]
Wait til you see what I end up with (Mills)
Momma didn't raise no dumb kid
Came from the dirt and licking man's merc
But now in a bema one series turbs
Money, money makes the world go round
The same way the money makes the girls go down
Blatantly killin dem
No more playing man a hundred pound
Straight ten grand minimum

[Tulisa]
My car, my house, my bills
These bitches know the deal (Tell em T)
Cause they're all paid by me
I got my own money and i ain't looking for no footballers
So if you wanna bring it to me
Let's take it back
I will defeat you

[Hook: Dappy]
Bun your cheap talk (pop, pop)
