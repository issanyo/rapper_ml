Jammer

[Skepta]
Living a dream Boy better know

What's the word on the streets
Baby mum got beat Now man are in beef
Me and my G's
Everybody got P's Everybody got weed
Different types
Some manna got Tye Some manna got cheese
Violate me somebody's gonna die
Everybody better leave A.S.A.P
When u see my G's you better show respect
Talking guns but when the beef kicked off manna phoning feds
Talking fans u got a stolen ped petrol on the red
Talking mum's one phone call and you're dead
You get a hole in your head, Fuck that
Manna got girls in the truck and they all wanna fuck
And I was like cuz if u don't wanna suck u better jump on the bus
Don't get rude stop winding me up cos I don't wanna cuss
And if I get mad that's a mental case that I ain't gonna buss
Back to the room like legend of goon
Wrestling with the belt took her for a jeans
I was gonna get her wet but she did it herself
Put in that work now she smoking the 'grette manna covered in sweat
Put on my shit murkle's coming in next I don't wanna cuddle in bed
Mental

Chorus (2x) [Lay-Z]
We live that fast life
Don't blink twice
Lustful advice
So many memories follow me

[Jammer]
I got niggas on beef and I got niggas on war
That's why u watching me for
I got girls on sex and I got girls on jaw
That's why she holla'd him for I'm a business man
So mind your business man 48 hours of law
I'mma hit this fam then I split this fam
Manna good lift in 'Dam and I get my bars
When the rave is ram and I say murkleman
It's all boy better know and they ain't part of the team
So they can't role with the fam Us manna got jewels
Yeah us manna go ham girls want the bread and jam
And I bring in the bacon but I don't fuck with the pig suttin like a muslim man
I got a bad attitude and I got a friend that's rude
That we never met the back of the hand on the back with the ban
And I got a friend like stan and I got weed like 'Dam smoke it by the gram
And I got a tune with Gritz and I got a link with sam
Manna living the dream us man are making cream but not from the back of the van
Man I'm back with the smash now manna back with the plus
Take man back to the past manna back to the future laptop and a computer
And a couple 16 bars tell a man don't ask
Manna done it gloves and a mask manna got the tool in the back
Don't talk to me bad see when you're talking to me you better talk in the pooch to your dad

Chorus (2x)
