[Intro: Shorty]
Yeah
I got gas
Like I'm ridin' L.A. with some lowriders in 1999, geez, yeah

[Verse 1: Shorty]
Everything's the way that it's meant to be
You can go away with your jealousy
I don't roll with no fakes, no celebrities
If we don't talk no more, then you're dead to me
Yeah it was meant to be, yo check the chemistry
I rep BBK to the death of me
They don't know where they're headin' G
They got the wrong mind frame, wrong energy

[Hook: Shorty]
It was meant to be, it was meant to be
They ain't seen nothin' like this in centuries
Yeah it was meant to be, it was meant to be
If we don't talk no more, then you're dead to me
It was meant to be, it was meant to be
It was meant to be, it was meant to be
It was meant to be, it was meant to be
If we don't talk no more, then you're dead to me

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah, you see the chemistry, you see the science
The BBK alliance, we're really out here duckin' from the sirens
Hyenas get eaten by the lions
You little niggas need to know you're fuckin' with some giants
Yeah, menace to society is what they kicked me out for
Weapon in my right hand, smokin' weed southpaw
Fuck the police, I'm an outlaw, blood I'm Makaveli
38 for them lightweights, they're talkin' like they're heavy

[Hook: Shorty]
It was meant to be, it was meant to be
They ain't seen nothin' like this in centuries
Yeah it was meant to be, it was meant to be
If we don't talk no more, then you're dead to me
It was meant to be, it was meant to be
It was meant to be, it was meant to be
It was meant to be, it was meant to be
If we don't talk no more, then you're dead to me
