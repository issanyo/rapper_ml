[Intro]

[Hook 1]
That's not me
Act like a wasteman? That's not me
Sex any girl? Nah that's not me
Lips any girl? Nah that's not me
Yeah, I used to wear Gucci
I put it all in the bin cause that's not me
True, I used to look like you
But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me

[Verse 1]
It's the return of the mack
I'm still alive just like 2Pac
Girls in the front row, girls in the back
Spit one lyric, everybody's like brap
Flashback to the cold nights in the trap
Now I'm in a new whip, counting a big stack
Yellow-gold chain and the diamonds are black
Jack me? Nah, you don't wanna do that
Somebody's gotta get murked
Counted to ten, but that didn't work
Spoke to my mum but that didn't work
Fuck this shit, I'm putting in work
Switched them plates, man are going on the grind
Black bally on and I look like a fly
Give Mumzy a kiss, tell her you'll be home soon
Come to the gates, somebody's gonna die

[Hook 2]
That's not me
Act like a wasteman? That's not me
Sex any girl? Nah that's not me
Lips any girl? Nah that's not me
Yeah, I used to wear LV
Put it all in the bin cause that's not me
True, I used to look like you
But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me

[Verse 2]
My eyebrows join in the middle
So nobody trusts me
They call me the exorcist
So when I do my ting, don't touch me
White girl in her bed with a cross in her hand
Screaming "Jesus, fuck me"
But I came with a blade and a teflon vest
So I don't give a monkey's
I stepped in with an outfit from Italy
You can't miss me, sexy
I might just dare Rihanna to kiss me
2009 in a Jeremy Scott outfit
Everybody wanna diss me
Now everybody's on this fashion shit
Well let me see your ID, let me see your swag history
They love me like Elvis Presley

[Hook 1]

[Outro]
Sexy, SK, deviation, Benji B, Flat White
Icy, yeah
