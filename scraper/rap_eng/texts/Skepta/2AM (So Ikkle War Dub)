Jammz already dead, now I haffi kill So Large
Think say he bad cause him shout but me shout louder
Christmas Day, his grandma did kick him out her yard
Cause his nostrils were full of powder
Eskimo Dance, Boiler Room
He tried holla at me on a mutual yardman ting
Tryna shake big man's hand for more than five seconds
Batty man, I ain't inna dem tings
He can get drag out his car, run away
And left out on Roman screaming "help"
How can I take a man serious
When he wear onion rings for a belt?
Man ah talk all this grease
When he see the eye of the dog, man, he melts
Belly get bubble up like Alka-Seltzer
He don't want no trouble cuh I'm smart like girl
So Ikkle cuh he's not large, give him two bags
And he will take your gun charge to the farrda
Teaching him how fi inform
And his police friend dem get rid of firearm
"But mi tek life", well, mi tek life too
So who you gonna hide under?
Talking 'bout next man bussing on next man's face
Yo, wah di bumba?
Dem kind of funny man tings, we do not condone
Same size as 8210 phone
Kick off your head, man ah liff up that
Your gyal said he can't even liff her back
Ikkle man, he can't liff up jack
Said I never got the call back
But we was in the rave, you was talking 'bout guys like you
Don't be doing no grime beef
Go after the man that kidnapped you
Ghetts was happy that he didn't bet
Cuh his money would've got tek
Bull in a china shop? Nah, we call that beef on a plate
Shank up steak
Tinchy and Danger said you're the reason they don't wanna spray
All this E300, Shower Hamlets
You're a little boy with a beard that sits down and baids
Capo killed you, now Jammz, your mate
Couldn't do what you did, dead same way
EastEnder, well you're Dirty Den
Cuh you did dead already, now you're dead again
I've spent your whole life expense on my friends
You spent your re-up money on one tenth
You spent a half a box on two skengs
You don't wanna see me in Bow at 2AM
That's a leprechaun dead at 2AM
Mini Me dead at 2AM
Dwarf and midget headback all spread at 2AM
Papa Smurf dead at 2AM
Wee man dead at 2AM
Beetle juice dead at 2AM
One of my likkle brother friend dem dead at 2AM
Beg off Grim? I didn't ever beg him
He was some mad guy FT styley
And me and MIK are the most copied MCs
After Dizzee Ras, Skepta and Wiley
That ain't no lie, G
"Bet you thought I was gonna say"
"I don't wanna hear no one talking about"
They're all behind me
You're dibby and tiny
Running off a next man's limey
I bill my own and so the money piling
Taking his auntie shopping
Like say I won't lick down Eileen
Mad Max, I mean
Aim it down low, then sky beam
Headshot, Yoda dead at 2AM
R2-D2 dead at 2AM
Little dinosaur called Gon from the third Tekken
Dead at 2AM
Ride out with my gunman friend
Smash man's head off the wheel
Mercedes logo on his forehead
Just like Moschino tattoo
Burst his head, now he's leaking ragu
Always tearing at his mic like a baboon
Can't take dem boy serious, dem man are buffoon
Hating on Rocks cause he's humble
But Mad Max held mi strap cuh mi deya inna jungle
Jook man's dread till it's dread, then slump you
You're the dibby Chinese man, Mr Chin ah get licked down
In Shottas, just like Max, done him
Had to send back cuh Caps bun him
With all facts, his tracks? Rubbish
I just bought a Zara top
I wanna see something run through it by the end of 2016
So Large Muslim but not on deen
Then we brought gammon in on Christmas Eve
And I don't even wanna talk about that little half-breed
Said he clapped hands but I clapped him in the cheek
And his likkle bredrins always smiling
But dem man passed through and he was hiding
Man ah light up everyone just like Heidi
If it ain't Grimsom then fuck that team
That ain't my team, Tizzy Gang's my team
You've got inheritance from your dad
You ain't ever been grinding
So Large, you DMed AJ Trace for a feature
And got aired, stop hyping
Wasteman, yeah
Everybody dead at 2AM
Big bike or ped at 2AM
Man ah liff off his head at 2AM
Cotch at his gates at 2AM
With some of my mates at 2AM
Feds got a call at 3AM
But we burnt everything at 2:55AM
Ergh
Two man dead in the war
Two man dead in the war
Now I wanna kill some more
I said now I wanna kill some more
Two man dead in the war
Two man dead in the war
Now I wanna kill some more
I said now I wanna kill some more
Oompa Loompa dead at 2AM
