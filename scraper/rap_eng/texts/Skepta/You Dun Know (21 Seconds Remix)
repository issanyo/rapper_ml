[Intro: Skepta]
Yo
Who is it?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Skepta]
I'm the thug of the family, who could I be?
S to the K to the E, that's me
Lyrically bury any MC, that's me
When you see me and P-O-double-T, that's a lot of things
I'm a little shit like Lady Sovereign
New freestyle, free Reggie, free a lot of things
I'm married to the game, but I ain't got a ring
So we can have a clash, and you can
Say what you want, say what you like
You can say a lot of things
But you can't say "suck your mum" though
I checked out the situation like Columbo
Can't be on this Uzi ting, cuz, I'm on a music ting
But I used to have a gun though
You won't ever hear me say I'm North London's leader
But I'm cool in my big Timb
When man see me, they say "wah gwan sho, you dun know"

[Chorus: Skepta]
You dun know
You, you dun know
Boy Better Know, we run the show
And if you don't know, please let me know, please let me know
You dun know
You, you dun know
Boy Better Know, we run the show
And if you don't know, please let me know, please let me know

[Verse 2: Flowdan]
You dun know how it go
Blacked-out shades, black from head to toe
Do it for the ladies, I do it for the dough
You can't surround man about wah gwan flow
I roll with the Shadow Demon and you know
You can't ever go in the ZIP, you don't know?
Didn't see me on the video? Oh no
I was doing the open show-show
I've got a whole heap of different gyal dem on the go
Gyal ah MySpace me from Tokyo
I'm bad to the bone, they won't leave me alone
She said "konnichiwa", said "you dun know"
Sho-sho ting all over the globe
It's a UK ting, forget your postcode
You dun know how it goes
I don't need to say much, I just say "ayo"

[Chorus: Skepta]
You dun know
You, you dun know
Boy Better Know, we run the show
And if you don't know, please let me know, please let me know
You dun know
You, you dun know
Boy Better Know, we run the show
And if you don't know, please let me know, please let me know

[Verse 3: Killa P]
It ain't nuttin' fi di Killaman fi make you say "you dun know"
On the roadside where dem ah run go
But I thought that the shotta dem would [?]
Beat dem like bongo drum, they beat congo
Roll Deep's finest, call me Your Highness
Kneel down and kiss the ring
Never-ever you try fi diss di king
Flowdan, Skepta and Killaman in the ring
Got the game locked and you can't do a ting
Mandem can't make a swing
But in the music ting? I swear down, my brudda
We're still doing this ting, ting
There ain't nuttin' to it, so watch how we do it
Four-fifth, dun know, we never two-two it
So know what you're doing when badman's slewing
Some bwoy tried fi hype up but nobody knew him

[Chorus: Skepta]
You dun know
You, you dun know
Boy Better Know, we run the show
And if you don't know, please let me know, please let me know
You dun know
You, you dun know
Boy Better Know, we run the show
And if you don't know, please let me know, please let me know

You dun know
You, you dun know
Boy Better Know, we run the show
And if you don't know, please let me know, please let me know
You dun know
You, you dun know
Boy Better Know, we run the show
And if you don't know, please let me know, please let me know
