[Intro]
Yo
You poomplex

[Verse 1]
I'm clocking them fake rappers
Eating oxygen cakes
Go home, listen to Boy Better Know
I sold more than the box of 'em mate
But if you're on my side
Chill, relax and enjoy the ride
I'm not a one-hit wonder boy
Trust me, I make music all the time
Someone's mouth needs shutting today
Everybody's got something to say
If I quit this music to my road
Half of you guys will have nothing to play
See I hear this stuff all the time
You think you can write bars like mine
Look in your lyric books and you'll find
3.14159

[Verse 2]
I only make bad boy tunes
So when there's all five man in the room
All communication stops
Cause if you don't hear me, then you're doomed
You can't test me, you might be a pro
I don't care, I'm mightier so
When you see my mix album on the shelves, cop that
It's a deal like Ikea
On the Boy Better Know CD, you'll get
Bare tunes from Jme, you best
Play my tunes at full volumes and shout
Shh hut yuh muh, rudeboy, poomplex, dickhead
You know I'm the best
Your favourite MC, there's no contest
Musically I'm ahead of the rest
Poomplex

[Verse 3]
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Turn them, shh hut yuh muh, there's no
Rudeboy, wipe your lips, wipe your squalms
I've got my own tees
Man see me and think I got P's
Tell them, eyo fam, you know me
Still hustling for my food to eat
I only go pubs, to play pool and that's if its a must
Plus if I can't get into the pool club
If not then I'll go make a dub
I don't do collabs
Hold me down like I've got flab
But I'm slipping, washboard abs
Breeze right through the track
Are you mad?
