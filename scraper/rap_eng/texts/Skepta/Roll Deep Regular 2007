[Pre-Chorus: Flowdan]
We roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Roll Deep

[Chorus: Flowdan & Skepta]
If I roll deep (roll deep with my crew)
If I eat food (eat food with my crew)
If I smoke weed (smoke weed with my crew)
How about you? How about your crew?
If I roll deep (roll deep with my crew)
If I eat food (eat food with my crew)
If I smoke weed (smoke weed with my crew)
How about you? How about your crew?

[Verse 1: Scratchy]
Roll on me or roll on Roll Deep
We roll deep regular
No, we're never inna no long ting
Had enough, that's it, now we're going on terrible
We're the wickedest ting
Who talk on the road? Bounce, I'm shangooli
You know me, I'm a creeper
Best in the game, it was bait that we would roll deeper
Pattern you or them or anyone else
Who's known or big in your ends
No skengs, paper and pens
Badmen, no spengs, no chickens or hens
Diamonds and gems, turn the grime hyper than dem
We jump tunes on your head
We roll deep on the regs
You won't get more response than B-U-N

[Verse 2: Flowdan]
Yo, what them ah go do when Flowdan get through?
Bumbahole ah get vex, true, dem can't get through
Me get double dark up on any corner
You can't say we don't rip through [?] avenue
We roll deep regular and we roll on you
For letting bad mind put a hold on you
These guys are not serious, they're like Looney Tunes
Tunes for the gyal dem and the showerman
That's why them can't test I and I
Cash money bank up till the day that I die
You've got food, drink, money on the table
And a whole label, dem man are pie
Ghetto superstar, business owner
Straight fast lane, forget the hard shoulder
Deep roller, double deep roller
[?] then it's over

[Chorus: Flowdan & Skepta]
If I roll deep (roll deep with my crew)
If I eat food (eat food with my crew)
If I smoke weed (smoke weed with my crew)
How about you? How about your crew?
If I roll deep (roll deep with my crew)
If I eat food (eat food with my crew)
If I smoke weed (smoke weed with my crew)
How about you? How about your crew?

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Skepta, I roll deep on the regular
Big [?] seven-seat on the regular
Boy Better Know T-shirt on the regular
Girl better know I flirt on the regular
Go on then, wah gwan?
When I'm in the dance, everybody knows wah gwan
See a couple badman in the centre, wah gwan?
And I heard that you're looking for Skepta, wah gwan?
Wah gwan? Wah gwan? Wah gwan? Wah gwan though?
Say you've got a big strap, look at your arm though
Say you've got money but you ain't got a car though
Think you're a big time shotta but you can't move a half O
You're a good MC, but I'm a star though
You're OK but you won't go far though
Clash me, I won't have a bar though
Could've been in Sidewinder or Cargo

[Verse 4: Riko]
Me and my crew, we roll deep regular
Travel the world, we smoke weed together
I'm with Danny Weed and Target in the hot seat
Yeah, you know we're gonna back Heartbeat forever
Ready for the war and beef whenever
And my darg dem flex like some real terrier
Roll Deep, we're like the top team
In the Premiership, La Liga or Serie A
Nothing in common, not a bit similar
And for my crew, you're not a bit ready for
You end up inna war with my crew
You buck up lyrics and dead, that's a real dilemma
I'm real with my friends like David Trimmer
My flow's tight, yours is kind of slimmer
Kind of marga, I am the farda
Babylon get burn up like-a lava

[Chorus: Flowdan & Skepta]
If I roll deep (roll deep with my crew)
If I eat food (eat food with my crew)
If I smoke weed (smoke weed with my crew)
How about you? How about your crew?
If I roll deep (roll deep with my crew)
If I eat food (eat food with my crew)
If I smoke weed (smoke weed with my crew)
How about you? How about your crew?

[Verse 5: Breeze]
Yeah, it's R2-D2
Me and C-3PO will out-team you
Ride through the war till the tints turn see-through
I can see you ducking like the beat don't see you
I roll deep 'cause I have to
I'm on [?] and Matthew
I roll deep on the regular
Bill her in the mirror, see me chatting on the cellular
I roll deep on the regs
Leave out with at least three Zs
[?] feds
Got twelve Qs down my left trouser leg
I'm a gooner, I roll with the reds
Clean up if I had a dad like Fred's
Car like Dean and a drum like Chev's
Got a basket but not enough eggs

[Verse 6: Jet Le]
Entourage roll deeper, slow movers get a sleeper
My real movers stay street
Creep, never get lifted off your back feet
I've been in this for a minute with the technique
First line better be a big line
'Cause getting the clique, we represent with the rhyme
From the East side with the West side providers
South side gliders and North side riders
So now, Jet in the team, we get darker
No long ting, backstabbers get sparked
In it from the go so I've gotta leave a mark
Hunger, thinking of P? The game starts
Regulate from the corner, the road sweeper
Hot like a heater, charge him like a meter
Back on the grind, packed heat, the grime reaper
Ain't got nuttin' pon me, the life cheater

[Chorus: Flowdan & Skepta]
If I roll deep (roll deep with my crew)
If I eat food (eat food with my crew)
If I smoke weed (smoke weed with my crew)
How about you? How about your crew?
If I roll deep (roll deep with my crew)
If I eat food (eat food with my crew)
If I smoke weed (smoke weed with my crew)
How about you? How about your crew?

[Pre-Chorus: Flowdan]
We roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Rah, we roll deep regular
Roll Deep

[Chorus: Flowdan & Skepta]
If I roll deep (roll deep with my crew)
If I eat food (eat food with my crew)
If I smoke weed (smoke weed with my crew)
How about you? How about your crew?
If I roll deep (roll deep with my crew)
If I eat food (eat food with my crew)
If I smoke weed (smoke weed with my crew)
How about you? How about your crew?
