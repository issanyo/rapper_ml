[Hook X2]
It's the simple life that I'm dreaming of
It's the simple life that I'm dreaming of
No more sleepless nights looking for the way to survive
But I simply can't afford to change it up, change it up

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Listen
Yeah, when I came in the game I kept my eyes wide open like fish in the sea
I'm done smiling with people I don't like in places I don't wanna be
She told me it's just a little bit of powder so I look better in HD
I saw the video, I had so much make-up I didn't even look like me
So now it's just me, myself and the camera, 1080p
She saw the video fullscreen on YouTube, now she wants to fuck with a G
Told me she'd come into my house in a long coat with nothing underneath
I would love you more if you brought me a packet of Rizla and something to eat
Please, keep it simple don't act like a leech
I don't wanna hear your "I'm not a groupie, tell me your real name" speech
My real name is Skepta and I do this for my niggas that breach
I do this for the girl with green eyes sunbathing topless on a beach
I tell an A&R come check me if you wanna talk about making an anthem
You wanna talk label politics, go and check David Cameron
Cause if success is judged by chart positions and riches
I'll put the mic down and leave my legacy to reign on all these bitches

[Hook]
I love you so much sometimes I can't breathe
But I still find that standing here watching you leave
I know you want excitement and life on the edge
And I lived like that for so long that it fucked with my head
It's the simple life that I'm dreaming of
It's the simple life that I'm dreaming of
No more sleepless nights looking for the way to survive
But I simply can't afford to change it up, change it up
