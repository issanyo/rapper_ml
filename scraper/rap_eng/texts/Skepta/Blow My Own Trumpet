[Intro]
Skepta
Some call me big headed
I say thank you very much
Doin' it again.com
Big man ting

[Verse 1]
My teacher used to call me stupid
And I was like how can i be stupid?
I got my walkman in my top pocket
My headphone goin' into my blazer sleeve
You think I'm resting my head on my hand
Nah fam, I'm listening to music
But you never knew what I was doing
'Cause I'm on the ball like Patrick Ewing
You better not get up your chair
'Cause when you come back you'll be sitting in the gum I'm chewing
I kept acting a fool 'till I left school
With one GCSE, screwing
Hit the road, sold drugs
Made music, got a little buzz
Then left the road for my supporters that showed me love

[Hook]
'Cause I was on the streets
Could've been locked up by police
Could've ended up dead
But I found a new hustle
Yeah man, I still juggle
But I ain't no clown
So like it or lump it, I'm on the road to a million pound
And I've got every right to blow my own trumpet
I've got every right to blow my own trumpet, Jeezy

[Verse 2]
Alright, alright back to the future
No Michael J. Fox, just Junior
AKA Joseph Adenuga, left school with one GCSE
Sell raising flour, two eggs and a ruler
I went home straight to the computer
My mum told me to turn it down
A couple years later I'm in the jeweller
Picking up shit I only dreamt about being able to afford
I bought my dad a brand new car
Straight off the showroom floor, no it weren't a Porsche
But it meant the same thing to him
Stop smiling dad, jump in the thing
Emotional shit, I wanna cry
My eyes tingling

[Hook]
'Cause I was on the streets
Could've been locked up by police
Could've ended up dead
But I found a new hustle
Yeah man, I still juggle
But I ain't no clown
So like it or lump it, I'm on the road to a million pound
And I've got every right to blow my own trumpet
I've got every right to blow my own trumpet, Jeezy
Boy Better Know

[Verse 3]
They wanna know how I'm on a way to a mill
But still, I keep it so real
Ok I'm ready to answer the question
No deal
Just me and Sam that's a good team
Right now I'm living the hood dream
Me, Ghetts, Giggs and C
Repping the UK at the BET
And Tinchy Stryder once told me
"Skepta play the game but break the rules
Even if it's a fistfight take a tool
Even if it's a one for person take it all"
'Cause no one's praising Boy Better Know for getting off the ground
So I ain't jumping off my high horse anytime soon 'cause it's just too far down

[Outro]
'Cause I was on the streets
Could've been locked up by police
Could've ended up dead
But I found a new hustle
Yeah man, I still juggle
But I ain't no clown
So like it or lump it, I'm on the road to a million pound
And I've got every right to blow my own trumpet
Sick in the head, Boy Better Know
I said I've got every right to blow my own trumpet, Jeezy
Free all my dons, from the bighouse
Got every right to blow my own trumpet
Boy Better Know, Ruff Sqwad, Movement, SN1, Bloodline, Meridian, Roll Deep, Alwayz Recordings
Successful hood brothers
You've got every right to blow your own trumpet
I can't tell you nothing
Skeppy, Doin' It Again.com, respect
