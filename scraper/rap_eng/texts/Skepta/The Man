[Chorus]
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man

[Verse 1: Skepta]
I don’t care what the weatherman says, when I step into the party I make it rain
We’re living in a jungle, when I come through, Tarzan better look after Jane
She wants me to go into the tunnel I told her jump on the train
Now she got my number stored in her phone book under a secret name
When it comes to ladies
Freddy Krueger knows I'm a nightmare cuz
Sitting in the passenger side of my best friend's ride and I still get love
So you better look after your wifey for the sake of your kids
You're talking shit about anaconda
But you don’t know where your girl’s G-spot is?

[Verse 2: G FrSH]
I got more bitches on the guest list
But because of this gold Rolex's
Feeling like I'm Professor X, bitch
The way I turn these man into exes
Cah it's marvellous how I
Chicks on chicks come out expect him
So like Houston, you'll have a problem
If you ever took a look at her text's
You're riding round in some polo
I come through and rob that pussy
I beat it up and I leave it
Don't judge judges, blame my jury
I've lost too much on courting
Got no time for talking
Yeah hide your wives and daughters
I run through these hoes like water nigga

[Chorus]
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man

[Bridge]
Nicca!
She say she got a boyfriend (what she say?)
She say she got a boyfriend (what she say?)
She say she got a boyfriend (oh)
She say she have a man

[Verse 3: Skepta]
At first she had her boyfriend on her screen saver
Now she’s changed it to a sunset
I can tell that she wants to go back
But the champagne ain't done yet
Who’s that fighting over there?
Is that B.B.R? One sec *kisses teeth* (awoh?)
She say she don’t like this party, let’s go back and watch a D.V.D
Went back to my room took out Jake the snake then I put her in a D.D.T
Then I said please tie this ball in your mouth and put on that P.V.C
She called me a prick but I still stuck it in 6 times like a B.C.G

[Verse 4: G-FrSH]
Treat your girl like a celeb
But she treat you like a groupie
While I treat her like a fan
So she spinning round and blowing on me while I hold the cam
For my bread she's going HAM
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
Cah man I'm so G'd up
She can be a trick nigga I won't treat her
A man really try to claim pussy
I don’t give a damn if that’s your beaver
If I like like I can beat her
Then turn her right like Tina
Cah what’s love got to do with it
When a new Jaguar meets a cheetah nigga?

[Chorus]
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man
She says she got a boyfriend but now she wants the man

[Bridge]
Nicca!
She say she got a boyfriend (what she say?)
She say she got a boyfriend (what she say?)
She say she got a boyfriend (oh)
She say she have a man
