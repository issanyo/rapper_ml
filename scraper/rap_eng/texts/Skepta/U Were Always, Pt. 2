[Verse 1: Skepta]
Told me that you were at home sleepin' (liar!)
So many times you took me for a fool
Really you were goin' out late in the evenin' (slag!)
In the club bang on the lash you were cheatin', up and down
All them Victoria Secrets that you were keepin'
That's not love, that's breakin' the rules
You think I'd never see those things you were tweetin'
Cut so deep, man couldn't stop bleedin' (check this!)
I was out there tryna get that house, on the grind
All I asked for was a, "Well done, Junior!"
Give my love to the boys, real shit
Instead you wanna argue and make up noise
Shit so fucked up, look at us now, fucked up
No nice words comin' out of your mouth
We get drunk and then we say it's over
Then, we get back together when we get sober
I don't what's true anymore
We're just goin' around in circles now

[Hook: Belly]
I remember the times when I called you my queen and my wifey to be
But somehow I'm always in the wrong, so I guess it ain't you, it's me
All the fights and the hype got a G stressed out but I can't lose sleep
But this time I know that's it's over, bare more tings in the sea
I remember the times when I called you my queen and my wifey to be
But somehow I'm always in the wrong, so I guess it ain't you, it's me
All the fights and the hype got a G stressed out but I can't lose sleep
But this time I know that's it's over, bare more tings in the sea

[Verse 2: Wiley]
If I told you before still would've got mad though (crazy ting)
I know you don't want drama, you don't want aggro
I still can't work out why you would cause a big scene in Nando's
We had a good ting goin' on but that's how that goes
I was drawin' away, in your house I didn't want to stay
Don't know when I woke up, I felt guilty for the whole day
Too many women on my mind, too many swimmin' in my mind
Now I'm out of control, I've been steppin' out of line
Yeah, she was a fling so it weren't nothin' major, it was just vibes
When I roll with her, she's got me in a natural high, no lie
And the time we spent was so great, I don't wanna blag
I'm thinkin' different now, babe, I don't wanna try
I wanna move on 'cause I want a fresh vibe in the future
I pick up on what's goin' on, trust, I'm not a snoozer
I know you heard I was spendin' bare time in the boozer
I know the ting we had was cool, but this tings much cooler
Ice!
