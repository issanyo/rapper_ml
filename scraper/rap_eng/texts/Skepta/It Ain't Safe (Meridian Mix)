[Verse 1: Bossman Birdie]
Boss Birds, I was in the trap writing gold dust
Zoned out, painting pictures but with no brush
All roads to my destiny start with pound signs
Getting money by any means, that was our lives
Shimmy ya, shimmy shimmy yay, ODB
That's what it's like when a nigga owed me P
Used to be in the kitchen, big man weight
Flipping that dough, like we frying up pancakes

[Verse 2: Paper Pabs]
I can never leave the streets cuh it's in my heart and soul
Just for playing, have you laying in the church, your heart, it go
Slurred speech, when I speak, so they think I sound lean
Alpine in my Alpino, pumping Al Green, old school
I was dying, all I had was two fiends
Hands dirty but my shoes clean, I had two dreams
Two chicks in my crib, check the camera's on, record
I ain't gonna stab 'em but tonight these bitches getting bored

[Verse 3: Skepta]
The crack I sold had them buzzing on the road
Crack residue in the buttons on my phone
Black leather boots when I run into your home
Ring ring pussy, it's your mummy on the phone
Yo Bossy, remember the first tool we ever had?
Rusty .38, came in a Gucci bag
Made a promise to Jesus that I would stop it when I blow
Now I'm in Brooklyn, they're going crazy at my show
