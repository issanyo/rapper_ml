Whenever you feel like letting go
And you've got your back against the wall
Hold on, hold on, cause you're undefeatable
First place, never settle for less
What's the point in trying if you ain't trying your best
They wanna see me six feet under but I'm watching my steps
Now everybody watching me like Jay-Z watches the Nets
Don't see myself on a skateboard but I stay on my grind
Aiming for the top and I won't stop till I cross that finish line
I see it like the deaf, I listen like the blind
So if I can't hear them scheming I still see the signs
I never count the days I make the days count
They wanna take my crown so I swim when they wanna see me drown
Smile when they wanna see me frown, stand up when they wanna see me down
New and improved attitude you don't wanna see me now
They said I can't do it but I did it
Now they love me all over the world
Cause they say that my style is so prolific
If I said it I live it, the black Scott diss it
Fresh haircut and a brand new suit lift up the trophy and kiss it
Whenever you feel like letting go
And you've got your back against the wall
Hold on, just hold on
Cause you're gonna take a few low blows
And I know you feel those broken bones
Just hold on, just hold on
Cause you're undefeatable
Tell the paparazzi I'm going in tonight
And if anybody wanna stop me, you're gonna need some kryptonite
I don't wanna sound impolite, but I been sitting here waiting my turn
So if you still don't know what a boy better know better watch and learn
I let my left foot rest on the side only my right foot's touching the pedal
Losing is not an option so I know that I've gotta come with something special
I'm a winner JME on my neck that's my gold medal
I was underground now it's time to take this s*** to another level
I never count the days I make the days count
They wanna take my crown so I swim when they wanna see me drown
Smile when they wanna see me frown, stand up when they wanna see me down
New and improved attitude you don't wanna see me now
I got nothing to prove I sit back looking at the game
From a birds eye view then I make my move
Never take my foot off the gas, I'ma go hard till I blow that fuse
Cause the moment you feel like giving up that's the moment you lose
Whenever you feel like letting go
And you've got your back against the wall
Hold on, just hold on
Cause you're gonna take a few low blows
And I know you feel those broken bones
Just hold on, just hold on
Cause you're undefeatable
You are undefeatable [x2]
