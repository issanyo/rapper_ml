[Hook]
But you just wanna stay in your house
Your very big house in the country
You don't wanna come out your house
Your very big house in the country
Wiley you just wanna stay in your house
Your very big house in the country
You don't wanna come out your house
Your very big house in the country

[Verse 1]
Yo zip it up. How can you be a king when you roll through anywhere
Wiley you don't roll through anywhere
I go anywhere blood I'm never scared
You said you rep E.3 but you're never there
So lemme murk this guy
It's all in your name fam I don't need to try
I take away the W, I take away the Y
Fix up the other letters all you do is just lie
Yo zip it up. How can you be a king when you roll through anywhere
Wiley you don't roll through anywhere
I go anywhere blood I'm never scared
You said you rep E.3 but you're never there
So lemme murk this guy
It's all in your name fam I don't need to try
I take away the W, I take away the Y
Fix up the other letters all you do is just lie

[Verse 2]
Chat shit talking like Barnets a joke
I got some Barnet guys moving keys of coke
Got some niggers on Dollis Valley that ain't scared to poke
Christmas eve running riot outside the Hadley Oaks, Madness
Wiley you need to chill ask anyone around me if I keep it real
And God knows if I ever made a mil
I'll still be doing shows in my hood for a bill

[Hook]
But you just wanna stay in your house
Your very big house in the country
You don't wanna come out your house
Your very big house in the country
Wiley you just wanna stay in your house
Your very big house in the country
You don't wanna come out your house
Your very big house in the country

[Verse 3]
Listen yo, Wiley I swear you're Boy Better Know
But I can't see your face when we do a show
Last time you came London was ages ago now you need a tom-tom just to get around Bow
You can't chat about Barnet zip it up
Pass me the north-side flag let me lift it up
Wiley you dropped yours fam pick it up
Must've been gassed up when you wrote zip it up
Back to reality you're living with the aliens
I don't know what made you think it was moist TV
It's the greaziest block in the former radius
Blood I got the voice that everybody listens to
When I'm talking and nobody's gonna zip it up when you walk in
You own 2 cars you own a bike
But you're still home alone like Macaulay Culkin

[Hook]
But you just wanna stay in your house
Your very big house in the country
You don't wanna come out your house
Your very big house in the country
Wiley you just wanna stay in your house
Your very big house in the country
You don't wanna come out your house
Your very big house in the country
