[Intro: D Double E]
I'm way too nang
Me and the beat go hand in hand
Shower man down with the mic in hand
Game of cards, got the best hand
Zoot in the hand as soon as I land
You can't tell me about smoking (bang)
All the promoters smoke with man
I've got the method man like Wu-Tang

[Verse 1: D Double E]
Come with the what, what? Come with the bang
Them man are what, what? Them man are prang
Lyrical lyrical Dan Gorgan
None of them man could ever test man
Not talking a wedding but I'm the best man
Soon as I touch the microphone, skank
You can't do what I can
Nah, you can't do what I... (ooh ooh)

[Hook: D Double E]
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I... (ooh ooh)
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I... (ooh ooh)
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I can
'Cause I step on the microphone, step on the microphone, step on the microphone

[Verse 2: Skepta and  D Double E ]
Yeah, Skepta and DEE, that's taking the piss
My album came out, community service got breached, days of school got missed
Feds want to know, "Who's this?" (ice)
Fifty racks in the contract and I had to give that a miss
Mum told me stay away from the witch
It's my world and I say who exists
So you better know man are expelled like  bang
You had a Glock and you still got  prang
That's what you get when you act like a  pagan
You can never diss  man
I'm a real devilish  man
100 so you best  understand
I'm a true African, covered in gold, getting paid like...  (ooh ooh)

[Hook: D Double E]
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I... (ooh ooh)
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I... (ooh ooh)
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I can
'Cause I step on the microphone, step on the microphone, step on the microphone

[Bridge: D Double E]
I'm a CEO, lyrical P-R-O (yeah)
Anywhere I go, fuck up the show
Smoking chro', counting dough
Always staying low from po po

[Verse 3: D Double E]
You're way too dumb
This MC is gonna get bunned
Washing line, he's going to get hung
Linford Christie, you better run
I am the original Dan Gorgon
I weigh more than a kilo, more than a tonne
If you don't know better ask someone
In the lyrical war, gonna need someone
'Cause I come with the, what, what?
Come with the what what? Come with the bang
Them man are what what? Them man are prang
Lyrical lyrical Dan Gorgan
None of them man could ever test man
Not talking a wedding but I'm the best man
Soon as I touch the microphone, skank
You can't do what I can
Nah, you can't do what I... (ooh ooh)

[Hook: D Double E]
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I... (ooh ooh)
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I... (ooh ooh)
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I can
'Cause I step on the microphone, step on the microphone, step on the microphone

[Bridge: D Double E]
I'm a CEO, lyrical P-R-O
Anywhere I go, fuck up the show
Smoking chro', counting dough
Staying low from po po

[Outro: D Double E]
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I...
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I...
Do what I can? Nah, you can't do what I...
'Cause I step on the microphone, step on the microphone, step on the microphone
