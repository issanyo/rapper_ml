[Hook: Frisco, Skepta, DJ Whoo Kid]
Whoever said money won't change you
Tell 'em from me that's a blatant lie
I ain't gonna lie, 'course it will change you (Skepta)
Just don't sell out your soul for a price
Don’t lose yourself, I ain't gotta prove myself to no-one, Frisco's certified
More time over my side or your side (Whoo)
Before you can draw yours I'm a draw mine (Kid) (Frisco)
I don't care if you're with four guys
You can bring more guys, more for the .45 (Bring 'em all)
Frisco hold the road like a four four drive
You don’t wanna get a box in your jaw side (Trust)
Vibe can’t die I’mma keep it alive
While I'm alive I'mma keep keeping the vibe
And as long as I got the mic in my right hand I’mma keep on keeping it live (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Skepta]
When you're looking at Skepta, you're looking at the Canary Wharf and the Gherkin
They better mention me when they're talking about London, nigga I'm murking
Sitting in my bedroom, smoking so much weed that my chest is hurting
On a porno website watching a sexy Latina squirting (Whoo!)
How can a man owe me money, but when I call him he don't answer my calls?
No less than Section 18 when I catch them fools
I don't care if he's got a screw loose, 'cause that nigga ain't got no tools
I don't care if he's got a baseball bat, that pussy ain't got no balls
You can't educate me about bagging up food, I'm an old school drug dealer
I walk to the shop in the pouring rain for clingfilm and a Ribena
Took the ball from one ends to another like Maradona at Argentina
I used to fuck with the light more than the dark fam, I had jungle fever
Nowadays I got so many ladies, in a million different complexions
Like Tinie when it comes to G-Shocks, I got a crazy dumb collection
New trainers in my house that I ain't worn since Obama won the election
My flow's so sick MCs trying to find our how I caught the infection

Whoever said money won't change you
Tell 'em from me that's a blatant lie
I ain't gonna lie, 'course it will change you
Just don't sell out your soul for a price (Talk to them)
Don’t lose yourself, I ain't gotta prove myself to no-one, Frisco's certified (No one)
More time over my side or your side
Before you can draw yours I'm a draw mine (Frisco)
I don't care if you're with four guys
You can bring more guys, more for the .45
Frisco hold the road like a four four drive (Can't forget, Shorty)
You don’t wanna get a box in your jaw side
Vibe can’t die I’mma keep it alive
While I'm alive I'mma keep keeping the vibe (Grime can't die)
And as long as I got the mic in my right hand I’mma keep on keeping it live (Skepta) (Whoo Kid!)

[Verse 2: Skepta]
My name rings bells in the UK, trust me, I make them jingle
But they love me all over the world, cause they say my style is so bilingual
I told them already I'm a star and I don't need a label to make me twinkle
Glinting relentless, thinking "where the fuck are the fans that bought the single?!"
Knock-knock, who's there? "Nigga It's", "Nigga It's" who? "Nigga It's Karma"
My mum told me if anybody punches me in the face, punch them back harder!
Last October I got caught on camera with no balaclava
Now community service are trying to turn Skepta into a gardener (Whoo!)
The women at probation wanna know why I see life in one dimension
I'm just trying to be a good man, living in a world full of bad intentions
I pick up the phone and I check my Twitter page
I see the devil in my mentions
I tried to phone God but it's like my nigga ain't got no reception
I really feel like letting some skeletons out the wardrobe, can I get a witness?
I want to say so much but I know business is business
And now that I'm on a playlist, I'm not trying to get put back on the hitlist
Back in the streets of North London, dipping in and out of tea with a biscuit
Frisco

Before you can draw yours I'm a draw mine (Check)
I don't care if you're with four guys (four guys)
You can bring more guys (more guys), more for the .45 (.45)
Frisco hold the road like a four four drive (four four drive)
You don’t wanna get a box in your jaw side (jaw side)
Vibe can’t die I’mma keep it alive
While I'm alive I'mma keep keeping the vibe (Boy Better Know)
And as long as I got the mic in my right hand I’mma keep on keeping it live
