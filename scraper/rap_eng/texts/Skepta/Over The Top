[Verse 1:]
I want 100%, not 50/50
I get money, but my name ain't 50
Went to the Lloyd bank, took out a Young Buck
Brown, purple, pinky
Then I put pink stones in the pinky
Bought an R6 and a motorbike jacket to make sure I minimise any injury
Come follow me
A lot of money's exchanging hands
They wanna know Boy Better Know plans
I told them smell this, can you smell that?
Mmm, grands, these other guys ain't got no fans
Wait 'til Jme's CD lands
Come follow me

[Hook]
I wanna make more than a hundred
I wanna make more than a thousand
I wanna make more than a mil
So I keep counting bills
One, two, three, four
Fold one over the top, more
One, two, three, four
Fold one over the top, more

[Verse 2:]
I was frivolous, but now I'm a saver
I'm a hustler by nature
I can sell bread to a baker
Sell a fence to my next door neighbour
I wanna buy a [?] with a laser cause I'm famous, but I'm still a raver
Girls see me in the club, they're like "he ain't got one bottle of champagne"
"He's got two!"
I'm like "Babe
That's how we do!"
Your man can't do it like me
No I ain't Lethal da B
You better ask someone quickly cause
Come follow me

[Hook]
I wanna make more than a hundred
I wanna make more than a thousand
I wanna make more than a mil
So I keep counting bills
One, two, three, four
Fold one over the top, more
One, two, three, four
Fold one over the top, more

[Verse 3:]
I make money, but I don't work in a mint
Brown, purple, pink
The queen looks pretty in pink
These other MCs are skint
I'm looking a black BM limousine tint
I don't want nobody to see me
Unless I'm on TV
Come follow me
Jack and stack, I've done that
The grime scene I run that
One thousand pounds for me, Max and J - bun that
More money, more paper
I want vehicles and mortgages
These other man don't know what ballin' is
Come follow me

[Hook]
I wanna make more than a hundred
I wanna make more than a thousand
I wanna make more than a mil
So I keep counting bills
One, two, three, four
Fold one over the top, more
One, two, three, four
Fold one over the top, more
