I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying

[Verse 1]
Might think I'm mad but I'm saying no
Personality colorful like a rainbow
Girls checking me out cause I'm a hot boy
Said they want to see me out stage show
Can't believe I'm here in the mainstream
It's not a daydream, I run the A-Team
A-listed, they missed it, yeah yeah, I get playlisted
I'm in the city like double yellow lines
If you pay a fine late you'll be doubling a fine
I'm gettin' money but I'm double in my mind
When I wasn't gettin' it I would double up on the crime
But now it's all good, I'm on a path with it
Do a song, have a joke, have a laugh with it
I ain't out here saying what its gonna be
No way cause I'm back where I wanna be (back!)

[Hook]
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be—

[Verse 2]
Heatwave [?], I'm mentally ill
Life it looks good but its all uphill
Till you get a brainwave and you forget the meal
Forget the deals but remember bills
And it's all in the sky like a parachute
I had a good heart when I never had a yout
So when I had another yout and I was like oh god
Got to work hard off for this other yout
That's why I did turn up to the cover shoots
Open minded taken advice from a stylist
She was like "have a look, here try this"
I just cycle through, like a cyclist
Played the system, gained the wisdom
Target the fans, I don't miss them
I ain't out here saying what its gonna be
No way cause I'm back where I wanna be

[Hook]
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be—

[Bridge]
Anytime I get on a riddim I'm gonna kill it
You could put me in a race and I bet you
I'm gonna win it, win it
I bet you I'm gonna win it
You could put me in a race and I bet you
I'm gonna win it
Anytime I get on a riddim I'm gonna kill it
You could put me in a race and I bet you
I'm gonna win it, win it
I bet you I'm gonna win it
You could put me in a race and I bet you
I'm gonna win it

[Verse 3]
Winning is a state of mind I love winning
Don't take a look on the beach I love women
So many walking around the clubs filling
So many pics are taken when I'm chillin'
Can't do it all but still I gotta try
This the life I chose, the life I'm living
I ain't out here saying what its gonna be
No way cause I'm back where I wanna be

[Hook]
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
I'm back where I wanna be, flying
