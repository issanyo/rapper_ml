[Intro: Skepta]
That's where we are right now, fam and that
Everyone in the crew is just like, tunnel vision
It's family, it's what we care about or nothing
Like literally, there is no money that record labels can offer us no more, it's dead
It's just, there's no point

[Hook: Wiley]
I've achieved tings I was dreamin' of
Step on the stage, start reelin' off
Yo, when I'm goin', better see me off
Well, not everybody's gonna be the boss
If you look into my face, gonna see a boss
If you look into the crowd, you will see a mosh
Do my ting like Marley and Peter Tosh
It's Eskiboy in your speakerbox

[Verse 1: Wiley]
I know my name's bigger than I make out
I used to push buj with the flake out
We had the first 110s that ever came out
I would book a New York flight, get the plane out
Wanna get my name out, we ain't got the same clout
Went through a bag of shit that they're payin' out
I had my watch and my bracelet and chains out
Realised that's dead, right then is when had to get my brain out
We ain't on the same shit
I'm tellin' everyone, we don't shot the same brick
You got the pellets, I'm a grime kid
Face it, the pavement knows me, basically, everythin' I know it showed me
Blud we ain't from the same strip
On my strip nah look get a face-lift
Drugs on the staircase, drugs in the bait lift, every day I weight lift
Cops and robbers wanna take it, I hate it

[Hook: Wiley]
I've achieved tings I was dreamin' of
Step on the stage, start reelin' off
Yo, when I'm goin', better see me off
Well, not everybody's gonna be the boss
If you look into my face, gonna see a boss
If you look into the crowd, you will see a mosh
Do my ting like Marley and Peter Tosh
It's Eskiboy in your speakerbox

[Verse 2: Wiley]
Made my street money, then I done a Phaze One
Me and Danny S. decide to make one
Club banger, street banger on the stations
Gettin' played every day it's in heavier rotation
I'm nationwide by now, people see the energy and take some
Stars in the sky yeah I made some
But how could I be here without
Biggin' up Maxwell and Luke and Jason
Yo, hear me on the sets 'cause I grace 'em
Me and Dizzee made it an occupation
Came from a council estate, I know 'em all, you can name 'em
I was outside in the cold it was rainin'
Standin' on stairs chattin' shit about the pagans
Nuttin' don't phase us, nuttin' don't phase 'em
You got a top boy on your side? Nobody rates him
I'm chillin' like

[Hook: Wiley]
I've achieved tings I was dreamin' of
Step on the stage, start reelin' off
Yo, when I'm goin', better see me off
Well, not everybody's gonna be the boss
If you look into my face, gonna see a boss
If you look into the crowd, you will see a mosh
Do my ting like Marley and Peter Tosh
It's Eskiboy in your speakerbox
I've achieved tings I was dreamin' of
Step on the stage, start reelin' off
Yo, when I'm goin', better see me off
Well, not everybody's gonna be the boss
If you look into my face, gonna see a boss
If you look into the crowd, you will see a mosh
Do my ting like Marley and Peter Tosh
It's Eskiboy in your speakerbox

[Verse 3: Wiley]
De wole ah wan', can't test when I wile out
I ain't gotta have a gang when I ride out
I just get my mind right then I slide out
'Cause if you're bait, one don will talk and everybody's gonna find out
I can bring a style out
Showcase the style, I put a vibe out
Pass me the water, I got a dry mouth
After that I spray a couple fire bars, make a shook spitter hide out
They ain't got the same drive
Do my ting at night or in the day time
Don't matter what time it is, I make time
And I have a Haze time and a break time
In a dance gyal a wine up your waistline
Everybody goin' mad to the bassline
Sippin' on a one drink at the same time
I power up around April and May times then I have a great time

[Hook: Wiley]
I've achieved tings I was dreamin' of
Step on the stage, start reelin' off
Yo, when I'm goin', better see me off
Well, not everybody's gonna be the boss
If you look into my face, gonna see a boss
If you look into the crowd, you will see a mosh
Do my ting like Marley and Peter Tosh
It's Eskiboy in your speakerbox
I've achieved tings I was dreamin' of
Step on the stage, start reelin' off
Yo, when I'm goin', better see me off
Well, not everybody's gonna be the boss
If you look into my face, gonna see a boss
If you look into the crowd, you will see a mosh
Do my ting like Marley and Peter Tosh
It's Eskiboy in your speakerbox

[Outro: Skepta]
There's no point in sayin' these numbers to us anymore because we've seen them, yeah
So now everyone's head's on, puttin' this thing on the map in a way that all the kids of today never have to go through what we went through
