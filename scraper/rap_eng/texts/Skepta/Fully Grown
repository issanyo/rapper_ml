[Verse 1: Frisco]
I'm a fully grown man, no, I ain't no teen
Love a bit of her but I ain't no fiend
'Nough of these guys ain't seen what I seen
Ain't been through what I been through, what you mean?
Say fuck that, ain't got a G for my T
'Nough of these guys ain't been where I been
None of these guys can't go where I go
None of them can't educate me about dough
You can't educate me about bagging up food
Ssh hut yuh muh and don't get rude
None of these youts ain't on what I'm on
But it's more than long if I'm in a bad mood
Like hey chum, big, give me space, give me room
Big Frisco, I've never been a waste on a tune
If we're on the same riddim when I make bars spitting
Then it's best you know your place on the tune

[Hook: Skepta]
I'm a fully grown man, I ain't no teen
These MCs ain't seen what I seen
You can't educate big man about street
Nah rudeboy, what you mean? What you mean?
I'm a fully grown man, I ain't no teen
These MCs ain't seen what I seen
You can't educate big man about street
Nah rudeboy, what you mean? What you mean?

[Verse 2: Frisco]
I'm a fully grown man, no, I ain't no yout
None of these guys can't do what I do
None of these guys can't shot what I shoot
None of them can't ever move food that I move
Bare big man know [?] in my crew
Step back cause I've got 9 in my 2
And you think that you're hard
When you know that you couldn't walk a yard
Not just a mile in my shoe
Look, most of the man dem shot 'caine
And pop shots to leave you in a box like Blaine
I come to bring back hype in the game
I'm a badboy, I got bare stripes to my name
Slowly but surely, I'm rising to fame
'Nough of these guys will lose their mind for the fame
I grind for my name, I know it sounds a little bit insane
But I'll die for my chain

[Hook: Skepta]
I'm a fully grown man, I ain't no teen
These MCs ain't seen what I seen
You can't educate big man about street
Nah rudeboy, what you mean? What you mean?
I'm a fully grown man, I ain't no teen
These MCs ain't seen what I seen
You can't educate big man about street
Nah rudeboy, what you mean? What you mean?

[Verse 3: Frisco]
I'm a fully grown man, you're just a likkle lad
You don't want Fris to flip and then get a little mad
You ain't had gash that I've had
Not one of them pose a threat, they ain't bad
What you know about setting up shop? You ain't bad
What you know about letting off shots? You ain't bad
And all that big talking you're talking
Ain't good cause I know [?] you ain't bad
I'm a fully grown man, you're just a likkle fam
Been a G from the start, not long [?]
Know yourself, control yourself
Get a hold and show some respect for your dad
Guess you can say I've got the gift of the gab
Make a guy know that he's gotta strip for the strap
Click to the clack, and when you hear the sound
You get down cause I'm sick with a strap

[Hook: Skepta]
I'm a fully grown man, I ain't no teen
These MCs ain't seen what I seen
You can't educate big man about street
Nah rudeboy, what you mean? What you mean?
I'm a fully grown man, I ain't no teen
These MCs ain't seen what I seen
You can't educate big man about street
Nah rudeboy, what you mean? What you mean?
