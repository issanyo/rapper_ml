Gang
You know what fuckin' time it is you pussies

[Hook: Skepta & SmokeDawg]
Nigga where's my money, where's my Ps?
Gang gang
You know I'm flying overseas
Gang gang
They see the diamonds and they freeze
Yeah, ten gunshots and then we leave
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck
I'm overseas, out on London
Overseas, in the six
Yeah, you know I'm flying overseas, gang
They see the diamonds and they freeze, bling
Yeah, ten gunshots and then we leave
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck
I'm overseas

[Verse 1: SmokeDawg]
I took over the city, I got UK fuckin' with me (gang)
Somethin' in the back for all these niggas tryna kill me
Nothin' but the door for all these bitches tryna diss me
Left her in the rain, I treat that bitch like she was Missy (fuck her)
I need the Ps, told 'em I need the Ps, I need the Ps
Flyin' overseas you know I brought the team (I brought the gang)
Told Skepta line the peng tings all on their knees
Ten shots then we leave, you know we gotta [?]
I don't ever slip, my nigga keeps it on his hip
I'm not hard to find, I did a show up on their strip
Different moves, I be makin' different flips (different flips)
On a mission, I got niggas trippin' bricks

[Hook: Skepta & SmokeDawg]
Nigga where's my money, where's my Ps?
Gang gang
You know I'm flying overseas
Gang gang
They see the diamonds and they freeze
Yeah, ten gunshots and then we leave
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck
I'm overseas, out on London
Overseas, in the six
Yeah, you know I'm flying overseas, gang
They see the diamonds and they freeze, bling
Yeah, ten gunshots and then we leave
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck, buck
I'm overseas

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Hush, hush, you don't wanna get touched
These kids ain't askin' much, I said hundred pounds
He said come then, now, gun them down
Back of the whip, that's where your son gets found
Them man are overseas, niggas know it's me
Man don't care if you got shooters, pussy, so have we
Man, I've got myself, fuck the lottery
Had my life planned out first time I played Monopoly
Yeah, it was either music or the cocaine (cocaine)
Chose my way, now I'm in my own lane (own lane)
Jump online, search my own name
And I got the pengest tings on my soul train (sexy)

[Hook: Skepta & SmokeDawg]
