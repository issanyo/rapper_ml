[Pre-Hook]
Lot of my partners dead and gone (Shit)
I got to pay my partners bond (Shit)
On top of that got child support
Where were you when I had hopped up out that porch?

[Hook] x2
Ok, I see no evil
I hear no evil
I see no evil
Hear no evil

[Verse 1: Skepta]
They said it's beef but that don't get to me
Just jumped on a plane again I'm reading vegan recipes
Doctor Skepta, man I got them remedies
But unfortunately you got to see a specialist for that jealousy
With this prescription that says your life sucks
Two shots to the face will clear that right up
Pussy, who you trying to size up?
You must not know me or you've been smoking on that white stuff
You don't want to see no blood
You don't want to see no flesh
You don't want to see no animals
You don't want to see no pets
Man I got them cats that'll creep in your house when you're in your bed
Man I got them dogs that'll put 16 teeth in your leg
Pussy

[Verse 2: Key!]
Ba-ba-ba
I hear gunshots all the time
Ba-ba-ba
Who fucking died, across my mind
Ay something going wrong
I gone feel I'm out my zone
Damn, I gotta get geeked up today
Damn, can't let them haters get in my way
Damn, I put the .45 in your face
Bwa, cause I ain't get [nothin to eat today]
Ah, shit fucked up in your shit
A type of baller nigga everyday I'm fucking seeing that
No disrespect but I had feel like Mike Brown
Nigga want to lay me down
Police lay me down
