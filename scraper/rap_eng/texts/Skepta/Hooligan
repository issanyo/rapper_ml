[Chorus]
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
It's Big Hooligan (It's Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand

[Verse 1]
I stand out in a crowd, yo, rah, that guy's loud
That's not allowed, 16 bars make my peoples proud
H ain't sweet, he's very bitter
Don't wanna see me behind the trigger
Street Crime UK, you get the picture
After the paper, tryna get richer
You get shook at night, me, I, look for a fight
Dem man there all hooked on the white
Can't come near me get out of my sight
I step out of the light, [?] are you alright
Dem man they like to talk and hype
Hm, I can see he's not right

[Chorus]
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
It's Big Hooligan (It's Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand

[Verse 2]
If I weren't here, how would he manage
Big time animal, man turned savage
Yo hustler, pick up the package
I ain't gonna kill or cause any damage
H is ruthless, H is reckless
Take off your chain, take off your necklace
Day's just started that's like breakfast
Can't stop moving, I feel restless
Cat for the cake, can't trust a rat or snake
Them man there get capped with the 8
No long, seriously slapped in the face
Don't want that on your plate, swear
You'll get left in a state
So impatient never gonna wait, never on time always late

[Chorus]
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
It's Big Hooligan (It's Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand

[Verse 3]
Hooligan, Hooligan, combat attack
Hooligan, Hooligan, H is back
Man wanna act like they live in Iraq
16 bars will die on a track
Hooligan, Hooligan, victim attacked
Old school rob man head get whacked
Can't get robbed, can't get jacked
Can't get fired, can't get sacked
That's fantastic, them MCs, they're all plastic
Open the coffin, open the casket
Stupid idiot spastic
Hooligan, Hooligan, H on a set
Hooligan, Hooligan, H is a vet
And I'm always seen as a threat
One of those people, you can't forget

[Chorus]
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
It's Big Hooligan (It's Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand
