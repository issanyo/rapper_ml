[Hook]
Studio takes all my time
Studio takes all my time
I'm putting in the work on the grind
Got music money on my mind
And we live the dream every night
Sipping champagne on a night flight
Can't even wipe the sleep out my eye
And I ain't tryna stop till I die

[Hook]
Studio takes all my time
Studio takes all my time
I'm putting in the work on the grind
Got music money on my mind
And we live the dream every night
Sipping champagne on a night flight
Can't even wipe the sleep out my eye
And I ain't tryna stop till I die
