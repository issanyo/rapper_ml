[Hook]
Good lookin', so refined
Say wouldn’t you like to know whats going on in my mind?
So let me get right to the point
I don’t pop my cork for every guy I see
Hey big spender
Spend, a little time with me

[Verse 1: Skepta]
If
Happiness is the only thing that money can't buy then there ain't much you can buy me
I'll be chilling in a French hotel smoking a big spliff, just waiting to whitey
Downstairs for dinner with a princess
Celebrities sitting beside me
This à la carte meal tastes so nice
Fucking hell, this shit's tiny
The sleeve on my shirt sits above my Rolex ever so slightly
The light hits the chandelier, hits the 18k, that's ever so shiny
Diamonds same colour as Bushkin
And my chain same colour as Mighty
Tell Flocka to tell Shawty Lo to tell Gucci Mane that I'm so icey
Connoisseur status, I still drink 'til the glass is empty
Tell the waiter I wanna taste some rosé, I'm looking for something zesty
Then I say grace, tell God to bless the food first cause he already blessed me
Looking at the price on the menu, to me now's a distant memory

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
This here is Givenchy, 900 dollar jeans homie
All these girls be raunchy, like let me see your peen homie
She tryna cause a scene, but I'm in Paris with my team
Walking slow like I'm on lean, damn a nigga jewelry look so clean
I occasionally ball in Lanvin, I ain't talking 'bout Jim Jones
Nigga, I'm talking 'bout hooping up, expensive shirt, breaking bones
Fuck yo Rolex, roll up homie, roll that kush, blow that homie
Oh stop that, the po-po on me, uh, shit.. out the window
We just getting saucy in Aussie, we bossy
Tryna bring back the term bling bling cause we flossy
You brought snapbacks back, well that's a cool accomplishment
I'm on the other side, on another globe on conference

[Verse 3: Theophilus London]
Fuck that
Home boy, I'm never home, I'm not even in my continent
In a town, I can't pronounce this shit, this is more than confidence
Fuck your continental breakfast, you incompetent
My nickname International, my accent changed by accident
It's Soho House put your phone away, I don't give a fuck who ya protege
I'm from Brooklyn, I fuck with Jay, time to time, I chill with 'Ye
Fans don't mosh, nigga they pause, bitches so fly like "Oh, my gosh"
Yeah, we selling out girls, girls, money yelling out
They planking cause they bored
Nigga need a new hobby, need a new body
You the biter, you the new hottie, you a stylist, wait in my lobby
Nigga dance like Bobby, tryna get like 2 cribs for my mommy
That ain't guac, bitch that's wasabi, tell Rich I'm the face of Tommy
