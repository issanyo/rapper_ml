[Intro: Trigga]
A likkle darker

[Verse 1]
Microphone check, 5, 4, 3-2-1
Keep dancing til' the party's done
I ain't come here to hurt anyone
I don't wanna hear no talk about gun
The only thing I wanna pop is champagne
Until my face is feelin' numb
See two mandem, wagwan don?
Check out the buff ting with a big bum
Me and the mandem we look daps
Black, hood, jeans and caps
I ain't come hear to lick no chaps
I don't wanna hear no talk about straps
The only thing I wanna pop is champagne
Until I collapse
I got drink yeah, man I got food
Come check me for the barley wraps

[Bridge: Skepta]
I heard you were looking for me
You don't need glasses, if you're looking for me
You don't need binoculars, if you're looking for me
You don't need to look far, if you're looking for me
I'm standing

[Chorus: Trigga]
In a corner, in a, in a corner
Some a dem or all dem, a guy dem a gwarn like dem a danger
In a corner, in a, in a corner
Some a dem or all dem, a guy dem a gwarn like dem a gangster
In a corner, in a, in a corner
Some a dem or all dem, a guy dem a gwarn like dem a danger
In a corner, in a, in a corner
Some a dem or all dem, a guy dem a gwarn like dem a gangster

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yes, yes, yes Trigga
Very, very, terror dome
I ain't come here to lick no phone
I don't wanna hear no talk about chrome
Only thing I wanna pop is champagne
Until it's time to go home
I'm lean, I'm in my own zone
Skankin', bubbling like foam
Bouncin', like Snoop Dogg's car
Dancin', oh shit, rah
Couple more mandem, wagwan don?
I don't wanna hear no talk about mash
Only thing I wanna pop is champagne
Until I run out of cash
"Yo, Sam, lend me a G"
You dunno the MySpace, forward slash

[Bridge: Skepta]
I heard you were looking for me
You don't need glasses, if you're looking for me
You don't need binoculars, if you're looking for me
You don't need to look far, if you're looking for me
I'm standing

[Chorus: Trigga]
In a corner, in a, in a corner
Some a dem or all dem, a guy dem a gwarn like dem a danger
In a corner, in a, in a corner
Some a dem or all dem, a guy dem a gwarn like dem a gangster
In a corner, in a, in a corner
Some a dem or all dem, a guy dem a gwarn like dem a danger
In a corner, in a, in a corner
Some a dem or all dem, a guy dem a gwarn like dem a gangster

[Verse 3: Skepta, Spyda & Bassmanâ€‹]
Well if you know Trigga, then you'll know Skepta
I'm the newest Shadow Demon Coalition soldier
NASA, NASA, NASA, rocket launcher
I'm double dark, triple heavy like Bass are
Them can't see we face, balaclava
Them can't see we face through balaclava
A four and a nine, dressed up in a parka
Say what dem call me? Black tarantula
Dirty astronaut, fly rocket super
Big money sound, sterling paper
Gold teeth dan gargan like Mr Ninja
No skin teeth when we're in a corner
NASA, NASA
Yes

[Outro: Trigga]
A likkle darker, yes, a likkle heavier
A likkle darker, yes, a likkle heavier
A likkle darker, yes, a likkle heavier
A likkle darker, yes, a likkle heavier
A likkle darker, yes, a likkle heavier
A likkle darker, yes, a likkle heavier
A likkle darker, yes, a likkle heavier
A likkle darker, yes, a likkle heavier
A likkle darker, yes, a likkle heavier
