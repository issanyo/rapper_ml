[Intro: Dizzee Rascal and Skepta]
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, shhhhhit
Yeah, yeah
Raskit and Skepta
Yutes in the end tryna get that cash
Yeah, goin' on dirty, goin' on stank

[Chorus: Skepta]
You throw a penny up the wall, pick the money up off the floor
You grip it, you flip it, tell the plug you need some more
Second time tonight, tell him you need a better price
He said the weight is heavy, tell him you need the exercise
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right (greaze)
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Hey, stop that, start that, get that (what?)
No, we ain't ducking no get back, it's Rascal and Skeppy
With something peppery for your headback
Ain't no disrespect better dead that
Come through stuntin' in somethin' all jet black
Mandem hustlin', crumblin', rollin' and bunnin' that jetpack
Stumblin, lungs are lookin' all jet black
Old school east side brother I rep that
You go check that you'll get your neck snapped
All of them setbacks
Kept me on the tip of my creps and I can't forget that
Forget my cheque and you will regret that
I get the cheque and they can't affect that
You better check that, this all correct up get that cheque back

[Chorus: Skepta]
You throw a penny up the wall, pick the money up off the floor
You grip it, you flip it, tell the plug you need some more
Second time tonight, tell him you need a better price
He said the weight is heavy, tell him you need the exercise
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right (greaze)
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Go on then, go on then, we don't play (nah)
It's Skeppy and Raskit back with a brand new track yeah the London wave (smoke)
Everyday man follow me surfin' online tryna catch the wave (the wave)
Get baptised, make your whole crew capsize
Been bullying crews for days (greaze)
Tell that pussyhole stop talking rubbish
Man came in with the thuggish ruggish (greaze)
You cannot talk about the roads to a guy that's fuckin' done it (done it, done it)
Yeah, running around the street with a balley for the money
Baby fathers got the yutes with the swammy in the buggy (woah)

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
I'm the alpha omega, please, take what's older I slay you freeze
Lay you out where you stay that's greaze
I don't ramp I don't play and I do not bend
And I do not sway with ease, they can't sway me away from Ps
I want all of the smoke I'm wheezy and I smoked about 1000 trees
Breathe easy you know my steez, E3 and Meridian Gs
Way I move so ghost I'm local but I'm thinkin' I'm overseas
Trying to seize some vitamin D, dotting the Is and crossing the Ts
You're a joker you can't be serious if you say you aren't from my trees

[Chorus: Skepta]
You throw a penny up the wall, pick the money up off the floor
You grip it, you flip it, tell the plug you need some more
Second time tonight, tell him you need a better price
He said the weight is heavy, tell him you need the exercise
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right
My money right, wait 'til I get my money right

[Outro: Dizzee Rascal & Skepta]
Ha-ha, just like that
They never saw it coming
We don't talk for the sake of talkin', we just get it done
Beats to the end, tryna get that cash
East, North, South, West, big up your chest
Goin' on dirty, goin' on stank
