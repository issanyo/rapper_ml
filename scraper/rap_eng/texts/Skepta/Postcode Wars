[Intro]
Skepta
Let's go
You know what I don't even wanna preach but
We've got a big problem in London
All this North, East, South, West
Segregation
It's childish, it's petty
Skepta
Right now I'm addressing the situation
What is it really about?
Postcode Wars

[Verse 1]
I've got business in West, ACs in South
Tools in North, food in the East
How am I gonna make money if I've got beef
All these postcode gang wars are just a joke
Tryna act like Carl Johnson and Big Smoke
'Til you end up in jail, like O.G Loc
'Cause everybody wants their crew to have the juice
'Til your friend dies and you're pouring out juice
North, East, South, West, everybody's from London it's all bless
And I'll tell you what really gets me vex
When I see guys everyday on some screwface flex
Trying their best to look annoyed
Why spend 80% of your day staring at boys
'Cause I ain't never heard of hate at first sight
But try and fight me and that will be your worst fight

[Chorus]
Stop, look, listen to me
'Cause this is as easy as crossing the road
Stop, look, listen to me
I don't really care about your postcode
Stop, look, listen to me
Your postcode makes no difference to me
North, East, South, West
Everybody's from London it's all bless

[Verse 2]
I ain't looking for any new friends
I know the top boys in all of the ends
The olders should know better
Why you screaming out your postcode like you want to live there forever
The housing kicked me out my estate
Bossman's in the big house, the ends don't care
Man wanna bring armshouse to my front door
It's not even safe in Chick King anymore
When you see me, say what you want, tell the truth
'Cause I wouldn't lie to you, but why do you wanna see my [?]
Especially when Meridian helped to put North on the map
Where's the love? I'm not in the Black Eyed Peas
But I know we were all brought up on black eye peas
Rice, chicken, okra, plantain and dumpling
If you don't care about that, do me something

[Chorus]
Stop, look, listen to me
'Cause this is as easy as crossing the road
Stop, look, listen to me
I don't really care about your postcode
Stop, look, listen to me
Your postcode makes no difference to me
North, East, South, West
Everybody's from London it's all bless

[Verse 3]
London is so small and so much beef is in it
The ends that you're repping I'll drive there in 10 minutes
This ain't America
Blud there's enough war in Iraq, stop the black on black
Your dad moved here to get a job, meet a wife
Have children, buy a house & make a life
Now you wanna start throwing up signs
Twisting up your fingers until you get arthritis
I've come through to educate the artists
Put it on your PC, save it on your floppy
Next time you see my album at the market
Tell the African man to save you a copy
Just because your postcode begins with an S
And my one begins with an N that's bless
Make sure you hail me up
You didn't choose to live there the council put your mum in that area

[Chorus]
Stop, look, listen to me
'Cause this is as easy as crossing the road
Stop, look, listen to me
I don't really care about your postcode
Stop, look, listen to me
Your postcode makes no difference to me
North, East, South, West
Everybody's from London it's all bless

[Chorus]
Stop, look, listen to me
'Cause this is as easy as crossing the road
Stop, look, listen to me
I don't really care about your postcode
Stop, look, listen to me
Your postcode makes no difference to me
North, East, South, West
Everybody's from London it's all bless

[Outro]
It's all, it's all
Bless
Hold tight the North London massive
Big up the South London massive
East London, West London
It's all London man, L-D-N, represent
London
Go on then, go on then
