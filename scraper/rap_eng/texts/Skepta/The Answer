[Intro: Skepta]
(I cannot deal with the jealousy)

[Chorus]
Something tells me
You're the answer to my gluttony
Something makes me
Wanna lock you up, throw away the key
Something tells me
You’re the answer to my gluttony
Something makes me
Wanna lock you up, throw away the key

[Verse 1: Skepta]
She knew what I was like when she met me (sexy)
Now she wanna lock me up, tryna arrest me
If I even stand next to a girl and she see what she text me
Nah, not me, I'm on a different energy
Swipe and delete that memory
It's clear to see I’m living my life, I'm doing me
(I cannot deal with the jealousy)
Putting in work, I ain't chilling in the bits
Champagne lifestyle, doin' up Ritz
Had to put a stop to the bickering shit
Now look who's got their knickers in a twist
You really thought you could better me
I'll make sure you remember me
Shake my head at how you went from a friend to a enemy
(I cannot deal with the jealousy)

[Chorus]
Something tells me
You're the answer to my gluttony
Something makes me
Wanna lock you up, throw away the key
Something tells me
You're the answer to my gluttony
Something makes me
Wanna lock you up, throw away the key

[Verse 2: Skepta & Daisy Maybe]
I already told you you were the one
I really don’t know why you wanna stunt
Got family getting involved
Relationship goals got you on your ones
But you know I still show out
That’s why the show's still sold out
See the queue at the front?
My nigga Rick put a Q in the blunt
Said "Skepta, should go to the stu for a month and kill"

Gone for two November
When you don’t get your way
So I stay out the same and chill then
I don't want no pressure
Pheromones they took the cage
So I fall down the rabbit hole again

[Outro]
Something tells me
You're the answer to my gluttony
Something makes me
Wanna lock you up, throw away the key
You're the answer, you’re the answer
Something makes me
You're the answer, you're the answer
Some
Something tells me
You're the answer to my gluttony
Something makes me
Wanna lock you up, throw away the key
Something tells me
You're the answer to my gluttony
Something makes me
Wanna lock you up, throw away the key
