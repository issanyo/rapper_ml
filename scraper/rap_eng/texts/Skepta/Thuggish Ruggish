[Verse 1: Ghetts]
Fuck who you are (pussy)
I've got a knife that'll run through your heart
All dem boy there kiss batty (bredders)
I never put a tongue to an arse (not me)
[?] come to the car
Fuck that, machete, cut you in half (ding)
You little cunt, you was soft
Blud, are you dumb? Blud, are you daft?
I could turn my man's blood to a bath
My nigga told me to tell you
If that's all your mandem he saw in your latest video
Stop all the acting, ain't one of you hard (every one of you)
Suck your mudda, you fraud (every one of you)
And man said "don't do a version of this"
When I asked him why, he said (why?)
"Cause D Double's too hard"

[Pre-Hook: Ghetts]
Head get mangled and dangled to the side
Just like I wear my Kangol
Long shotty in my hand come to my ankles
Yo, man have got plans that I can't cancel
Man have got straps that I can't handle
Man have got man that are part animal
So nah, you can't think man are cool
Cuh man a man are mad and radical

[Hook: Ghetts]
Oh
You know you done fucked up
You're like Caine in that interview room
You know you done fucked up
I said oh
You know you done fucked up
You're like Caine in that interview room
You know you done fucked up

[Verse 2: So Large]
Cuh you see mi... can't go jail again
Big V6, can't move like a snail again
Can't forget the last time I got taken in
Didn't take me long to push weight again
Bare man wait for my reign to end
Think I'm 'fraid of them? Think I'm 'fraid of them?
Stay round a couple young gunners like Chamberlain
Put in work for cheap like Romanians
Can't play with them, papers wafer thin
Left the wah? Tek the wah?
Got me sounding like Wayne and them
Can't left the cash money like Drake and them
If I give my shooter the green light
Better hope they change again
Death or anaconda, don't take me
Picture me rolling in my Mercedes

[Pre-Hook: Ghetts]
Head get mangled and dangled to the side
Just like I wear my Kangol
Long shotty in my hand come to my ankles
Yo, man have got plans that I can't cancel
Man have got straps that I can't handle
Man have got man that are part animal
So nah, you can't think man are cool
Cuh man a man are mad and radical

[Hook: Ghetts]
Oh
You know you done fucked up
You're like Caine in that interview room
You know you done fucked up
I said oh
You know you done fucked up
You're like Caine in that interview room
You know you done fucked up

[Verse 3: Rival]
(Headshot!) Check this, motherfuckers
I'm going on like a nutter
I ain't tryna shut down im telling man shut up
16's slump mugs
What the fuck's up?
This strap is not smart
That's what I call a dum dum
Head get mangled and dangled
But come around my way, man are getting punched up
Cause I know you think you're hench
But I'll bad up every one of you numb nuts
We can get it swinging like nunchuks
Man are getting put down for man tryna come up
Fuck thuggish, I'm going on ruggish
"Crudd Central" in effect for you dumb fucks
Strap, plus your head
Dividing your mind, your death's what I sum up

[Pre-Hook: Ghetts]
Head get mangled and dangled to the side
Just like I wear my Kangol
Long shotty in my hand come to my ankles
Yo, man have got plans that I can't cancel
Man have got straps that I can't handle
Man have got man that are part animal
So nah, you can't think man are cool
Cuh manaman are mad and radical

[Hook: Ghetts]
