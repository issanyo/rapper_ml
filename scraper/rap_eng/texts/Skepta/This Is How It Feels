[Verse 1: Skepta]
You see, the zone that I'm in when I'm writing my lyrics
Will make a dog bark, I'm surrounded by spirits
And I'm in the chart for a minute
But the way the game's set up, I know I'm not supposed to be in it
But I'mma kill it, no matter
Your CD was a joke like Fonejacker
Vegetarian breakfast, not one banger
Didn't wanna let me into the game at first, so I put my arm through the letterbox
And opened the door with a coathanger
Now they can't ignore me
This is real life, not a fictional story
This is how it feels when you've got a flow like mine
I say the first line, the crowd say the rest of it for me
Trust, I'm a lot more than a little bit
Fully-equipped to murder a hypocrite
Now man are like "Skepta, you're killing it"
Recycle the flow, can't get rid of it
And I keep it real, so when the shit hits the fan
The real fans don't give a shit, bitch

[Hook: Joe Grind]
This is how it feels
When you've got a flow that can make a whole mill
And it makes the world feel hype
But to you, it's not a big deal
This is how it feels
When you've got a flow that can make a whole mill
And it makes the world feel hype
But to you, it's not a big deal

[Verse 2: Joe Grind]
Woke up, washed, put my shoes on
Hit the cash point, where's the loot gone?
Must be on the other cards
Whatever you think, add a few on
Skeps told me "haunt this, make these fuckers scream, Joe"
If you've got it, flaunt it, let these bitch niggas know
You get a penny for your thoughts
I put my thoughts on paper, I make retard dough
My team's out of this world, no spaceship
We've worked damn hard, no one's gonna take this
You should've seen them niggas' faces
When we marched in like the saints did
A lot of people hate this
We've made faces, green face paint shit
Oh
This is how it feels when you've made it

[Hook: Joe Grind]
This is how it feels
When you've got a flow that can make a whole mill
And it makes the world feel hype
But to you, it's not a big deal
This is how it feels
When you've got a flow that can make a whole mill
And it makes the world feel hype
But to you, it's not a big deal
