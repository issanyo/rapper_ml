[Chorus: Ambush X Chip]
Yo
Grew up on a dumb estate
Buzzworl' that's a jumpy place
Everybody getting white boy wasted
Right now I can't feel my face
Two chicks in the back just waiting
Tryna act like they don't wan wait
Slowdown babygirl it's late
I can't drive in this state
And I don't wanna crash this rental
Cah the depo looking all cray
And your girlfriend looking like cake
Looking like crème brûlée
And the next one looking like choc soufflé (Sweet one)
And we done a lot today
We were chilling on the block today

[Verse 1: Chip]
Bare niggas want a verse from me (who am I?)
What's my name? C-H-I-P
C's up like I'm from C town (C's up)
Buzworl Ambush a MC
I went school in T
Late nights we sneak to bae's in Wood Green
Hoodie up, hat low on a W3
No beef but affiliations get peak (maud)
Not standing with 30 g's (facts)
Cuban on me like 30 gs
Just me, tush money and teeth
That's kush and money and teeth
3 lions, fuck 30 sheep
But I ain't with the violent raps
Niggas talk .44's, gassed in a 4 door
Strip you with a violent chat (lyin')
I ain't gotta buy no waps
My nigga said "Chippy we got you"
God said "sky dem tracks"
5 MCs on my jacks
I'll spin 'em like Michael Jacks
Please don't forget these facts (never)
I let it clap no cap (booom)

[Chorus: Ambush X Chip]
Yo
Grew up on a dumb estate
Buzzworl' that's a jumpy place
Got my cally in my zoot, I'm wasted
Right now I can't feel my face
Two chicks in the back just waiting
Tryna act like they don't wan wait
Slow down babygirl it's late
I can't drive in this state
And I don't wanna crash this rental
Cah the depo looking all cray
And your girlfriend looking like cake
Looking like crème brûlée
And the next one looking like choc soufflé (Sweet one)
And we done a lot today
We were chilling on the block today

[Verse 2: Skepta]
All of this ice on me
Still man I got no chill
I was on the Billboard chart last week
Look this week, and I'm on there still
I see the niggas in the back just hating
Tryna act like they keep it real
Move to the rich part, oh your baiding
Catch man slippin' on Primrose Hill
Better put respect on my name when you speak it
I said Lukey World and I mean it
If it don't make sense then I leave it
Texting me bullshit, den I just swipe and delete it
Texting me bullshit, den I just swipe and delete it
Millions on the table, tryna get paid
Na, I ain't tryna catch no case
That's why the shooters got no face
And the Lyca's got no trace
The Prada's got no lace
And you haters got no taste
Meridian t'ug 'til I'm old and grey

[Chorus: Ambush]
Yo
Grew up on a dumb estate
Buzzworl' that's a jumpy place
Everybody getting white boy wasted
Right now I can't feel my face
Two chicks in the back just waiting
Tryna act like they don't wan wait
Slowdown babygirl it's late
I can't drive in this state
And I don't wanna crash this rental
Cah the depo looking all cray
And your girlfriend looking like cake
Looking like crème brûlée
And the next one looking like choc soufflé (Sweet one)
And we done a lot today
We were chilling on the block today

[Verse 3: Ambush]
Ayy, shit den
Remember I was trapping out a Citroen
Labels tryna offer man brick money
Must have thought we ain't got bricks den
Try take badman for children
Try take badman for kids den
Got the juice from Skepta
Had to get the munk from Chip den
You're a prick now, and you was a prick den
Dis year I'm bussin' all the mandem
Next year money and chicks den
Took Neenz and Lavish and Dots
And the whole hood miss dem
They took Neenz and Lavish and Dots
And the whole hood miss dem
Why you think there's so much yack in the system?
Henny and the mally, man mix dem
Put the crème brûlée on a choc soufflé
I'm the man in the middle, man mix dem (twist dem)
I don't wanna crash dis big ting (Cah the depo looking all cray)
But I'm tryna smash dis thick ting

[Chorus: Ambush]
Yo
Grew up on a dumb estate
Buzzworl' that's a jumpy place
Everybody getting white boy wasted
Right now I can't feel my face
Two chicks in the back just waiting
Tryna act like they don't wan wait
Slowdown babygirl it's late
I can't drive in this state
And I don't wanna crash this rental
Cah the depo looking all cray
And your girlfriend looking like cake
Looking like crème brûlée
And the next one looking like choc soufflé (Sweet one)
And we done a lot today
We were chilling on the block today
