[Hook: Skepta (x2)]
See the money on my mind, that's way too much (way too much)
Way too much
See the drink in my cup, that's way too much
Way too much
See the girl on my left, that's way too much
(Way too much)
Big Fekky and Skepta, what the fuck are they gonna say to us?
Way too much

[Verse 1: Fekky]
I'm still drunk off that bubbly
I'm still here, saying "come on then, touch me"
Tell your girlfriend to stay up out my DMs
Might catch me in the BM with your B-itch
You know me, I'm doing alright, me, I'm doing alright
I can do it all night, do it in black, do it in white
Cause it's way too much, I can't say too much
But the chain on my neck weigh too much
Way too nuts, shut up

[Hook: Skepta (x2)]
See the money on my mind, that's way too much
Way too much
See the drink in my cup, that's way too much
Way too much
See the girl on my left, that's way too much
(Way too much)
Big Fekky and Skepta, what the fuck are they gonna say to us?
Way too much

[Verse 2: Fekky]
Me and my brothers get wavy, way too much
Can't wait 'til the day 'til I sit here and say we made it, way too much
One more bottle, I'mma drop my brother, I'm faded, I'm faded
Think you can leave your girl round us, you're crazy, way too much
Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bang
My friend, been Fekky from way back when
I was out here repping my ends, and you was in bed by ten
You see now, they're just hating, way too much
Pay 50 for the coupe, way too much

[Bridge: Fekky]
I'm doing alright me, I'm doing alright
I can do it all night, do it in black, do it in white
Cause it's way too much, I can't say too much
But the chain on my neck weigh too much
It's way too much, shut up

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Me and my Gs get purse
See me in the club, all the girls on me
Don't give a shit what a man's worth
Don't give a shit if your girl's nails on fleek
Don't give a fuck about your voodoo curse
God bless me, you can't put your spells on me
Fekky said he wanted a verse
I said "don't put anybody else on, please"
Cause big man ting
Nowadays is death by association
Every day I pray to the most high
Them man are following Satan
Man are working with some different energies
Everybody knows, it's blatant
Ask Julie, ask Jason
Or Jme, them man ain't adjacent
I go way-way back
Something like Microsoft
But sometimes, see this internet war?
Fam, I swear down I'm so lost
But I stay lost in my own mind
So there won't be a day when I go off
If man are talking too much shit, fam
I switch the iPhone off

[Hook: Skepta]
