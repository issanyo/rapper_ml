[Intro: Producer Tag, LD & Skepta]
The amount of money I'm gonna be making would hurt your parent's feelings. Remember the class where I taught you all how to make it rain? That's what I'm going to be doing, every single night
Big business
Greaze!

[Hook: Skepta & LD]
The price just went up in the brand new whip, got the neighbours watching (Ay, ay, ay)
Trying to get paid, get gwop in
Man talk shit, now the mandem is on him (On him)
He was out champagne popping
Don't ask me, I don't know who got him (No)
Everyday man scream peace and love
But God knows that the beef ain't stopping (All'a 'dat)
The price just went up in the brand new whip, got the neighbours watching
Trying to get paid, get gwop in
Man talk shit, now the mandem's on him (Ay, ay)
He was out champagne popping
Don't ask me, I don't know who got him (Ay, ay)
Everyday man scream peace and love
But God knows that the beef ain't stopping (Hmm, hmm)

[Verse 1: LD]
When you mention me (L)
Better mention real
Mention the fact that I shell down shows with gang and I'm out here still (Drilling)
Mention the fact I could rise up 100k, no major deal (Indeed)
Better put me down as king or governor, any time you mention drill (Hm)
More time I should have been at home billing it (Ay, ay)
But I was outside drilling it (Bow!)
I've come a long way from the days I was brucking down Zs, sitting down clinging it (Uh-huh)
Stage shows, I'm bringing it
Award shows, I'm bringing it
Any mash, I'm filling it
Any whip, I'm whizzing it
You know bro's linging it
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
What do you mean, you fool?
How you diss L and think every 'ting's cool? (Huh?)
I done burst man, I flew birds when you were chatting shit with your friends in school
I know mental; that's K
So I get why these niggas all hiding their jewels
It's all risky trying to bring drillers to a show
Got a toolbox with tools (Hmm)
It's all ments if this whip gets pulled (Fuck)

[Verse 2: Skepta]
This ain't a freestyle, this is expensive talk (Hmm)
Back then eighteen-pound-forty, yes, I was taking shorts
Now you want the SK air better jump on eBay, that's an expensive walk (Six, six)
Pulled up to the after party looking like I just stepped in sauce
And they can't keep up, man it just won't last
Man diss me and I think it's funny 'cause I'm printing money when I spit these bars
Better get a new plan, better think it fast
Put badness in the past
But if I make corn fly
Better know my corn flyâ€”business class
Next year it's about cribs and cars
I tell 'em, "Don't watch my chain"
Try take this and I'll take your soul
I don't even watch the games
My young niggas phone me like, "It's a goal"
SK level means they already know wagwan
Murder anything moving when I got the mic in my palm
What do you mean who's on the beat motherfucker?
That's Carns
