[Verse 1: Skepta]
You see the four best crews in the game I'm in them
If you don't like me do something then
10 minute screw faces I ain't in them
I want paper; divi divi wages I ain't in them
My crew put five Â£20 notes in a roulette machine and spin them
Anybody get rude I'll clench my fist and chin them
Forget a mash, Forget a clash, they're trash; I'll bin them
I don't wanna lyrical swing, I will physically swing them
That's why I haven't clashed anybody since "long son den some win seng"
If I hear man say my name I'll ring them
If I hear any skeng talk on my 3310 I'll find out where they are and link them
Headlock power-drive and pin them

[Hook: Skepta]
I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see
I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see

[Verse 2: Skepta]
More, more, more money more paper more, more money more paper
I wanna see more dough then a baker
Run tings like Ninjaman and Kartel in jamaica, promoters pay me nuff paper
You know me man, the only man who could ever give me a bill is a waiter
Skepta heavy, heavy like pacer, I like the way things are going now
I gotta start collecting the dough in
I used to only get bookings in the UK now
Me and my crews boarding the 747 Boeing
I gotta get that dollar get that euro get that yen
Come back to England fit that again
I repeat fit that again!

[Hook: Skepta]
I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see
I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see

[Verse 3: Jammer]
I work hard everyday, I won't stop grime until everything's kosher
Until I got the house on the hill that looks like the one on the holiday brochure
I want power but it can't be solar, I've always wanted to be a high roller
When I was young I had to get Nike I couldn't get Gola
I had name brands when I was on my stroller
I'm a big man now so I want a bow tie and a bowler
Forget Ps like Diddy, I wanna make Ps just like Coca-Cola
For the big house in Angola, and the big Range Rover
And the P's legit so it don't really matter if police wanna come an try pull man over

[Hook: Skepta]
I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see
I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see
