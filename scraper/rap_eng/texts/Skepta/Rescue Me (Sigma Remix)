I've been breaking it down for you baby
Running around,I can't see no love for me
Somebody rescue me
I'm the king of the town mr crazy
Creating a sound still no love for me
Somebody rescue me,just rescue me
Meee
They call me S K EPTA before i start i just wanna say
Boy you better know what i mean
I've got bumblebees tryin to figure out how i got this buzz
All I want is a kiss and a hug
But somebody told specsavers i can't see no love
Days,Months years
Blood,sweat,tears I walk the streets of london facing my fears
Everyday's like truth or dare,so spin that bottle
Beacuse if it lands on me imma stay true to my word
And i don't want anymore respect than i deserve
Well i've been braking it down for you baby
Running around,l can't see no love for me
Somebody rescue me
I'm the king of the town mr crazy
Creating a sound,still no love for me
Somebody rescue me,just rescue me
Rescue meeee
Juss,no ceiling,i walk all over the beat no floors
She says i love you loads,i say i love you more
They say i've changed,i say i'm changin
I left the wrong girl,got a lady i dont get no thanks
No round of applause
But i keep on trying i'm upset but i keep on sighing
When i get knocked out,i get back on my own two feet
I keep on fighting,i sacrifised gravity so i could live my dream
Because reality is far from the place i'd like to be
Well i've been braking it down for you baby
Running around,l can't see no love for me
Somebody rescue me
I'm the king of the town mr crazy
Creating a sound,still no love for me
Somebody rescue me,just rescue me
