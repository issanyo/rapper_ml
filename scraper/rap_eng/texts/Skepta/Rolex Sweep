[Intro]
One, two, three
Count with me, count with me
Count with me, count with me

[Hook]
Count with me
One glass of champagne for me
Two glass of champagne for you
Three, Now do the Rolex Sweep
Do the Rolex Sweep [x4]

[Bridge]
I told her to drink up
Select and play the song that I asked for
If you want to link up
Then you can meet me on the dance floor
50 Cent can't dance like me
Soulja Boy can't dance like me
Michael Jackson can't dance like me
No, so

[Hook] (x2)
Count with me
One glass of champagne for me
Two glass of champagne for you
Three, Now do the Rolex Sweep
Do the Rolex Sweep [x4]

[Bridge]
I told her to drink up
Select and play the song that I asked for
If you want to link up
Then you can meet me on the dance floor
50 Cent can't dance like me
Soulja Boy can't dance like me
Michael Jackson can't dance like me
No, so

[Hook] (x2)
Count with me
One glass of champagne for me
Two glass of champagne for you
Three, Now do the Rolex Sweep
Do the Rolex Sweep [x4]

[Bridge]
Only got one bottle when I walked through the door
1 o'clock and I bought one more
2 o'clock I'm in the corner skanking
2:30 I pulled one more

[Hook] (x2)
Count with me
One glass of champagne for me
Two glass of champagne for you
Three, Now do the Rolex Sweep
Do the Rolex Sweep [x4]
