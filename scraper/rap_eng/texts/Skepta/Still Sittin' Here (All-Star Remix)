[Hook: Fekky]
I'm just sitting here
Doing what I do (shut up)
Smoking on a big fat zoot
I heard they wanna make a move (come on den)
You must be blood
I've got that ting and it goes bang
Bu bu bang bang bang
Bu bu bang bang bang

[Verse 1: Meridian Dan]
Cause I'm sitting here, fam, where you sitting?
There's no way that I can stop spitting
On my downfall man keep wishing
And I don't wanna make any man go missing
I'm still sitting here
Doing what I do
Can't catch me on the high roads tripping
Rudeboy ting, I'm German Whipping

[Verse 2: Tempa T]
Provoking the war, provoking the war
But when it gets peak, they don't really want beef
Man wanna set up on street with his nine
When he gets slapped, he's calling police
They ain't making no noise
"I was just sittin' here", not gonna take that
They ain't making no noise
When I boy off the ting, boy boy boy boy boy boy
They ain't making no noise (BOY!)
They ain't making no noise (BOY!)
They ain't making no noise

[Verse 3: Skepta]
I've been sitting here before my name was Skepta
Before I got signed to the label
Man said they're still sitting here
Them man must be sitting on a different table
Any song that I'm on, that bangs
And my bars kick just like Liu Kang
Anytime you see the king's crown on my head
Look with your eyes and not with your hands

[Verse 4: Jammer]
Tell a pussyhole I'm on a million
Been doing this since Palace Pavilion
Sets with Eskiboy and Dizzee on
D Double E, Kano on the sticky joint
Tell 'em reload den da da diddy ba
Because the mandem are murking
Me and my Gs and we're out here doing this ting
Still sitting here, everything's live O

[Verse 5: D Double E]
Oh my
Bluku bluku
Ain't got time for law and order
Listen clear and follow my order
Lick a man down and then cross the border
All my man dem are well out of order
All my man dem are ill and gully
Body get left at the bottom of the gully
Man will get wrapped up like mummy
Even mami

[Hook: Fekky]
I'm just sitting here
Doing what I do (shut up)
Smoking on a big fat zoot
I heard they wanna make a move (come on den)
You must be blood
I've got that ting and it goes bang
Bu bu bang bang bang
Bu bu bang bang bang

[Verse 6: Jme]
Man's sitting in the exact same seat
That I sat in when I said "shut ya mout"
In '06, when I touch mic
They're like "oh shit", raw
You can't make Ps if you spit so poor
Like bare dead MCs back in '04
Where are they now? Ask Terminator
"They're not around no more"

[Verse 7: Chip]
Yeah, they're not around no more
They're clapped off, no round of applause
Everybody gets runs in the game
I don't know how to hate, let a nigga have yours
It's a new day, I'm in a new place
Can't win today's race with yesterday's awards
You don't really want Chipmunk back on this ting
I'll smash my plaques on the floor
Like 'fuck the fame'
Take note, you can't keep the change
Kill man off in like 16
Fool like that for your numbers game, oi, what you saying?
You ain't been the grime scene saviour or the Boy In Da Corner
So what do you call it, what do we call ya?
Sittin' here on the "Sittin' Here" remix though
I'm getting back to the lab, Frisco

[Verse 8: Frisco]
I'm untrue like ya dun know
Man have upped the ting dem by the tonne-load
No roadrunner but I run road, I'm just sittin' here
Niggas don't wanna get silly here
Me, I'm out here like a traffic warden
Moncler top with the matching Jordans
For boredom I kill MCs for media
You man give me joke like an Inbetweener

[Verse 9: Tinchy Stryder]
Yo Fekky, I need more
I need more than an eight, give me eight more
I'm like an automatic gun with rounds
While dem man are jamming like a rebore
In fact, I'm a liar, the king eight-liner
From tings in boots to the gun fingers
To the Stryder, Stryder, who's that Stryder?
Spray ill, sick as saliva

[Verse 10: Kano]
Fuck your Prada and Margiela
I'm old school like sarsaparilla
Gucci loafers with no socks
No typo but that's mark error
I break down features, a bar legend
Pissing on beats, I'll R Kell-em
In MC terms, I'm R9
But hold tight to all of them R7s

[Hook 2: Fekky & Kano]
I'm just sitting here
In your bitch's Mini Coop'
She's sitting on this big bamboo
Rolled up on her BF like "fam"
You must be blood
I've got that ting and it goes bang
Bu bu bang bang bang
Bu bu bang bang bang

[Verse 11: Kano]
My new flow
You might see my face on the television
Or in a bait rave with Ace bottles spinning
And I came with my A game, no date but it's dinner
Fekky gave me an eight and I ate up the riddim
