[Hook 1: Footsie]
Somebody told me the game was dying
Somebody told me the game was drying up
And they want one big bag of grease
When it comes to the Generals, straight bag of grease
And you dun know we're doing it straight from East
Somebody told me the game was dying
Somebody told me the game was drying up
And they want one big bag of grease
When it comes to the Generals, straight bag of grease
And you dun know we're doing it straight from East

[Verse 1: D Double E]
Somebody told me the game was dying
Somebody said that it's drying out
Don't know 'bout you man, man are flying out
Don't know 'bout you man, man have got bookings
Newham Generals, we get a look-in
Everyting's nice just like my granny cooking
Bag of good food on the table
[?] able
Cuh man are the deepest camp when it comes to performing
We don't ramp, every minute, man are touring
Us man are live and dem man are boring
With the effort, blud, we put more in
That's why all the neighbours are encoring
That's why all the ravers, they're imploring
Come to the show, blud, it's far from boring
You man are deadout

[Hook 2: Footsie]
Somebody told me the game was dying
Somebody told me the game was drying up
And they want one big bag of grease
So I phoned my greasiest link in North
Skepta from BBK, of course

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Even though I've been away for a hot minute
"What'd you mean, you fool?" is still a hot lyric
I rep my team all day so even if the belt's Gucci
You know what I drop with it
I took my grime flow, went pop with it
And I'mma go straight to the top with it
But Footsie sent the beat, told me to murk it
So there's no way I will not kill it
I see a lot of man moving like they just ate spinach
Me? I make beats and write lyrics
But when it kicks off, I'm in the front row
Like I bought the most expensive ticket
I've got niggas in the hood on my phone like
"Don't watch that, Skepta, let me kill him"
They can't wait to come out, put my hands on my belly
And I swear you'll feel them kicking

[Hook 1: Footsie]
Somebody told me the game was dying
Somebody told me the game was drying up
And they want one big bag of grease
When it comes to the Generals, straight bag of grease
And you dun know we're doing it straight from East
(Dun know the dun know)

[Verse 3: Footsie]
Somebody told me the game was dying
I said "nah, blud, you've gotta be lying
These UK artists, they just ain't trying"
What CDs has he been buying?
Wipe your tears, son, stop crying
I'm bringing the UK back
I'll carry the whole scene on my back
Dem man are, dem man are, dem man are hard
Yeah, the Generals are back in the place
Act up and you will get a smack in your face
And put straight back in your place
Yeah, I was chilling before
When I said "fuck that" and jumped back in the race
Now look, now I'm back in your face
I'll take my place at the front of the race
(Cause I was in this rave one time and...)

[Hook 1: Footsie]
Somebody told me the game was dying
Somebody told me the game was drying up
And they want one big bag of grease
When it comes to the Generals, straight bag of grease
And you dun know we're doing it straight from East
