[Chorus 1]
It's all sticks and stones
Yeah, it's all sticks and stones
It's all sticks and stones
You better bring some sticks and stones
Yo, it's all sticks and stones
You better bring some sticks and stones
If I punch man in the face I'll make your lip lean to the left like Sylvester Stallone

[Verse 1]
Words can't hurt me, forget the Chinese whispers
Skepta's back with a brand-new banger for the listeners
Mandem hate 'cause the ladies wanna take pictures
I go hard from New Years Day to Christmas
Niggas in jail go mad for my scriptures
Sticks and stones
Man already know about me, I'm the one man soldier
Sticks and stones
You don't want beef, you want a vegetable samosa
Sticks and stones
I'll run through the strip like the race was over
No long ting when the war gets colder
I jump in like 50 in Angola

[Chorus 2]
You get me, it's all sticks and stones
You better bring some sticks and stones
If I punch man in the face I'll make your lip lean to the left like Sylvester Stallone
Yeah, it's all sticks and stones
You better bring some sticks and stones
If I punch man in the face I'll make your lip lean to the left like Sylvester Stallone

[Verse 2]
Any time I spit a bar, I make the DJ wheel it
Now that I've got a little limelight, man wanna steal it
Better talk to the guy you thought you could jack me with
Anybody threaten my life, I'll beat him
With the same hand that I Rolex sweep with
Sticks and stones
See me in the white 350, man wanna hate me
Sticks and stones
I'm never on the hype, but I'll do a 30 for Jamie
Sticks and stones
Turn man into a ghost like Patrick Swayze
I just wanna make more money go crazy
But man wanna see me in the Old Bailey

[Chorus 2]
You get me, it's all sticks and stones
You better bring some sticks and stones
If I punch man in the face I'll make your lip lean to the left like Sylvester Stallone
Yeah, it's all sticks and stones
You better bring some sticks and stones
If I punch man in the face I'll make your lip lean to the left like Sylvester Stallone

[Verse 3]
Too many MCs run around, talking reckless
Bad thoughts in my head, now I can't sleep, I'm restless
Never see me roll in a 20 man gang of pretenders
Skepta, I'm on some one-man ventures
Them man have got fake beef like wrestlers
Sticks and stones
Never catch me off guard, you better do your squeezes
Sticks and stones
Die hard like a soldier, no sorry, no pleading
Sticks and stones
No wasteman's gonna stop my crew from eating
In the morning, afternoon and evening
I rep Boy Better Know 'till I stop breathing

[Chorus 3]
You get me, it's all sticks and stones
You better bring some sticks and stones
If I punch man in the face I'll make your lip lean to the left like Sylvester Stallone
Yeah, it's all sticks and stones
You better bring some sticks and stones
If I punch man in the face I'll make your lip lean to the left like Sylvester Stallone

You get me, it's all sticks and stones
You better bring some sticks and stones
If I punch man in the face I'll make your lip lean to the left like Sylvester Stallone
Yeah, it's all sticks and stones
You better bring some sticks and stones
You don't want me to start rinsing it
Like I just got let out the mental home

[Outro]
Danger, tell these babies there's no space in the manger
Skepta
Sticks and stones break bones, words can't do nothing
Sticks and stones
Microphone Champion Skepta
Sticks and stones
2000 and everything
Sticks and stones
Straight, Boy Better Know
All day long, til my heart stops beating, go on then!
