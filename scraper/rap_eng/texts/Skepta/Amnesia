[Hook]
Somebody remind me what happened last night
Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means, feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this amnesia

[Verse 1]
Last night was sick, oh, what a city
I lost my phone though, oh what a pity
When I woke up I found a note that said "Sorry I had to go, ILY"
I looked around: this can't be real, cause I don't recognize this
Then I saw the mini-bar and I was like "Rarr, somebody terrorized it"
Not even a bottle of water
Make it worse, this room is hotter than a sauna
So I jumped up, got ready
Went downstairs to the hotel lobby
Man are like swear down you're a mad man skeppy, I must have had one too many
Cause I can't remember anything after the two Jaegermeisters and a bottle of Henny

[Hook]
Somebody remind me what happened last night
Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means, feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this amnesia
Who you trying to diss? Who did you fight?
Who did you kiss? Who did you dance with?
Who did you lipse?
Aw man, you were a myth

[Verse 2]
I remember walking in, blinded by the lights
Look left, look right
Saw 2 men that I don't like
But I already lit up the room when I walked in
No need for fireworks tonight unless it's on the side of a bottle
And I'm only here for one night on a high, so I'm trying to find me a model
We circled the party once, nothing
Twice, dead
Third time around I saw a girl that I wanna tuck into bed
Two minutes later, I'm at the bar
Doing shots of Jaeger
That's when I blacked out, anything after that's all a myth
Like Noriega, major

[Hook]
Somebody remind me what happened last night
Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means, feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this amnesia
Who you trying to diss? Who did you fight?
Who did you kiss? Who did you dance with?
Who did you lipse?
Aw man, you were a myth

[Bridge]
Had one drink, two drink, three drink, four, had one too many, now you're laying on the floor
Had one drink, two drink, three drink, four, had one too many, now you're laying on the floor
You lost your phone
You lost your friends
Now here comes that classic line - I'm never drinking again
Thought you were casually drinking
But you were actually binging
Woke up somewhere you've never been to in your whole life
And now you're thinking

[Hook]
Somebody remind me what happened last night
Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means, feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this amnesia

Somebody remind me what happened last night
Cause I can't remember a thing
This must be what it means, feel like I've been in a sleeper
I think they call this amnesia
