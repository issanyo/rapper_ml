[Intro: Skepta & D Double E]
Yeah
Before we even start
Rest in peace any OGz, Boy Better Know
Let's go
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Carry heavy leng that will leave big scars
Carry heavy leng that will leave big scars
Trust, yeah, Boy Better Know, OGz, Skepta
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Blacks, P Money, Been There Done That
Listen

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Yeah, come lemme go let me start off
Boy Better Know that's the team I'm part of
Us man have fun over here
You man are still working your ass off
The Tom-Tom said I'm getting to my destination in 4 hours
I said "Tom-Tom, look at my car, calculate that again then, take half off"
'Cause the cars way too much
I breeze off with the lightest touch
A pedal for the brake, pedal for the accelerator
But no pedal for the clutch
Tiptronic and auto cuz, I get more money, I get more stuff
But them MCs are like having sex when I'm drunk (wow), they're never gonna buss
We get paid that's why them man wanna hate on Boy Better Know and OGz
I'm blessed that my creps ain't holey
I'm focused, yeah you know me
I don't play games, fly with the big names in big planes
Carry heavy leng that will leave big stains
So remember, under your skin there's bones and veins

[Hook: D Double E]
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Carry heavy leng that will leave big scars
Carry heavy leng that will leave big scars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Carry heavy leng that will leave big scars
Carry heavy leng that will leave big scars

[Verse 2: Blacks]
I won't stop 'till my cats ballin'
Feel sick right down to my organs
Last year I know [?] man merked it
Me, P Money, Little Dee (Perfect)
Us man have this ting on smash
Them man there was just talking trash
Fans said I spit big bars I'm a madness
I'll laugh in the rave like Badness
Any violation aka pars
Phone up Smiley ask for the star
Man's just tryna keep this humble
Grime's like one big jungle
Man move like angry lions
I'll kill any crew what [?] they're flyin'
I've got nothing to prove
Man know what it is

[Hook: D Double E]
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Carry heavy leng that will leave big scars
Carry heavy leng that will leave big scars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Spit big bars, roll with the big stars in big cars
Carry heavy leng that will leave big scars
Carry heavy leng that will leave big scars

[Verse 3: P Money]
I spit big bars, par with the big stars in big cars
That will rip with mad force
[?] got the car moving like it's a black Porsche
Driving so fast the car looks blurry
Nobody can tell if there's back doors
I'm in the car where heaters are (Blud!)
Them man are out in the cold in the train station being told they gotta change platform
Don't think your hot 'cause your hat's warm
It's not only the car that's full of petrol
This guy next to me is a big star
He's leaded not unleaded, he's mental
Now you know what I draw for in case you thought it was a pull in the zoot or a pencil
I write mine them [?] (Teeth!)
That's why my problem's dental
