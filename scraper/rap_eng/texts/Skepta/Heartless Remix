(Hook)

You know me I'm super cool
But nobody can take me for a fool
Cause when I start loading up my tool it's where you ask
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?

(Verse 1)

Yo yo why would you do that?
It like you want another Biggie and 2 pac sinario
I thought you knew that
Skepta I get Heartless like Bushkin and Mighty Mo
I'm 26 now
I'm partying with some porn star chicks now now
After I give her my kit kat chunky she's asking me and Ez for the twix now
See I came from the block like Jenny Lopez
And now my whole family have got no stress
I love cruising in my 350z
If it's a drive by pass me the moped

(Hook)

(Verse 2)

Boy better know that's my clique
I know my team are getting paid and you don't like
I used to show off with pinky notes now I just take my card out and I swipe it
Ain't got time for no beef with no children
Talking to the champion like I was Paris Hilton
You better know I'm a Tottenham simple soldier big up Mr. Wilson
Round here we don't like you
Switch off that MC put on my tune
And if I don't listen to your shit lyrics
Then how the fuck did I bite you?

(Hook)

You know me I'm super cool
But nobody can take me for a fool
Cause when I start loading up my tool it's where you are
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
Boy Better Know
How could you be so heartless?
