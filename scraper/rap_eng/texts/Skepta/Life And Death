[Hook: Big H]
Life and Death
Back, forward, right and left
Your time to die I guess
Off point soldier, die in your vest
Life and Death
Back, forward, right and left
Your time to die I guess
Off point soldier, die in your vest
Life and Death
Back, forward, right and left
Life and Death
Back, forward, right and left
This one's Life and Death
Back, forward, right and left
Back, forward, right and left
This one's Life and Death

[Verse 1: Big H]

Wicked deep H trust
I come through with the eight in a rush
Won't see me ever wait for the bus
Get merked, try take my stuff
Already told them I've had enough
£17.50 that's not enough
Them kind of cats disappear in the dust
Bloodline family tear and crush
Big explosion, Fire and Smoke
Can't test H you will die and choke
Them MCs smile and joke
That's why he can't write what I wrote
You will die for a note
No joke, no job, knife in the throat
Man want to talk all hype in my bolt
H corporation had them with rope
This ain't commercial, this ain't catchy
Hold tight Indians, big up iraqis
So far ahead they can't match me
This one's violent, itchy and scratchy
Don't be afraid, ain't got my cache then manna get weighed
Won't see H with a skin and fade
This one, this one's not arcade

[Verse 2: Skepta]
I roll with the soldiers but it's not Kuwait
Manna got nines and eights
Little bit of Merdian Estate
Little bit of love, little bit of hate
Little bit of treble and bass
Little bit of Skeppy and H
Better mind what you say in the interview room when they press record on the tape
Feds wanna know where the mandem live
So I moved out of my mumzy's crib
Got a new phone, got a new chip
Got a new haircut, got a new whip
Let a pussyhole try take this
Ten blacked out niggas in a lift
Yes I'm a one man soldier but I've got a big family like Patel and Smith
MCs diss me I make them history
100% not 50:50
I still kill but my name ain't 50
This one's violent, Ren and Stimpy
This one's ugly, Heather and Minty
Yeah, stinky
I stay true to my history so I might pass you nyabinghi

[Verse 3: Bossman Birdie]
How you going to cut me out of the game?
I am the picture, I am the frame
Talk right when you spit my name
A to the K that will split your brain
Skeng in the dance, skeng in the place
Skeng on my back, skeng on my waist
Skeng over beat, skeng over a bass
Talk too much I put a skeng in your face
Talk about dough and they don't get money
See me down at Westwood believe I'm gully
£100 T Shirts, nothing ain't funny
Elvis, Jesus, covering my tummy
Covering my shoulders, covering my back
My proceeds didn't come from rap
My proceeds just there all wrapped
Every day I'm hustling, yeah that's fact
Told them no consent
Lock off the dance with coke on tent
Bossman, H, Prez T, Pablo
Them Bloodline niggas show no respect
Man claim they're holding Tecs
Them man there they got holes in creps
Come around me with some badboy talk
And they're running round town on stolen peds
