[Intro: Frisco]
Oi rudey
Oi rudeboy
Oi, oi we don't believe you fam
No one believes you cuz
It's Big Fris, Skepta
Back 2 Da Lab Volume One (yo cuz)
And all the long talking's done
Oi rudeboy

[Verse 1: Skepta]
When I MC I spit fact not fiction
Kill off any wasteman no restriction
So if the bar sounds like it's for you
That's because you fit in the wasteman description
I can walk on foot from shanktown to black boy lane
Everybody stays safe man
I'm not a top mash I ain't blazed man
But I'm a skeng daddy for them wasteman
So keep bussing your sly little jokes
You must think I ain't onto the madness
Sorry mum pardon my language
But this guy needs to eat one pussyclart gunshot sandwich
Done a MC quick
Can't compare their crew to my clique
When I make a tune it's totally sick
How can I clash this up and coming piece of shit
You think you're the best I'm better
You're just a qualified MC bredder
Your flows are stolen
That's why mine are fresher word for word letter by letter
T H E S E M C S, chat a lot of BS
Oh yeah PS he said that he'll spray anybody in the face
While you and I know he's talking about CS

[Chorus: Frisco]
Oi rudeboy. stop talking we don't believe you, stop talking
Oi rudeboy. stop talking we don't believe you, stop talking
Oi rudeboy, stop talking we don't believe you, stop talking
Oi rudeboy, stop talking we don't believe you, stop talking
Oi rudeboy

[Verse 2: Frisco]
And you can't fuck with the team
Nah blud kill a guy with a sixteen
'Nuff big bars plenty in my team
Cuz there's bare showerman MCs in my team
So sekkle down you ain't got anything on my team
Think you're bad say something on my team
Look you'll get something in your beam
Never once seen your face in N15
So cool off and pop the tool off
Take the jewel off and laugh in your face
You don't wanna see me get dark in the place
I'm with man that will make shots spark in the place
Man better cool better calm in the place
Diss me and you won't get far in the race
Frisco's a fully grown man
You're just a likkle waste
I will box MCs in the face
Man better cool better calm better chill
I don't wanna slap an MC in the face
But you will get a back hand in the grill
I'm a big boy you're a likkle man still
So allow all the tough talk that's not you
My mans a bad boy that's not true
Don't fool me not one bit
We ain't amused stop chatting to the boys in blue

[Chorus: Frisco]
Oi rudeboy. stop talking we don't believe you, stop talking
Oi rudeboy. stop talking we don't believe you, stop talking
Oi rudeboy, stop talking we don't believe you, stop talking
Oi rudeboy, stop talking we don't believe you, stop talking
Oi rudeboy
