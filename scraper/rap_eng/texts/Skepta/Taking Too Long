[Hook]
Don't get carried away with me
Cause I don't care if you want me baby
Don't get me wrong cause you got it goin on
But you taking too long

[Verse 1]
I'm a 100%, no I'm not a zero
Beyonce knows I've got such a big ego
But you ain't feelin me, so
Let me switch off the mac
Cause I keep tweeting but you ain't tweeting me back
And I don't wanna act totally crazy
So hasta la vista baby
How can I be big like benny and you trynna make me feel small like ten
I must've been a fool back then
But you know what, I don't wanna be your friend
Let alone your partner, I just hope that you don't believe in karma
Cause it will come back ten times harder
Truss me

[Hook X2]
Don't get carried away with me
Cause I don't care if you want me baby
Don't get me wrong cause you got it goin on
But you taking too long, you're taking too long

[Verse 2]
I made one call, sent one text, no reply no stress
My phone asked me if I'm sure I want to delete the number, yes
No further questions, I don't wanna read a statement
It's blatant, my name ain't Adele so why am I chasing pavements
Took me for granted, thought I was talking the hardest
She's like a internet gangster, she don't wanna show love to the artist
I just hope that you don't believe in karma
Cause it will come back ten times harder
Truss mee

[Bridge]
Don't you forget about me
And you'll see I could be all you need
Oh I'm through, I'm through with chasing you
This is over, this is over

[Hook X4]
Don't get carried away with me
Cause I don't care if you want me baby
Don't get me wrong cause you got it goin on
But you taking too long, you're taking too long
