Selecta, mix it up now with the fader

[Verse 1: Jammer]
I'm a big man but I'm not 40
Yo, watch me get naughty
Murkle Man, that's what they call me
Brought myself in, nobody brought me
I'm a big man but I'm not 40
Yo, watch me get naughty
Murkle Man, that's what they call me
Brought myself in, nobody brought me

[Verse 2: Jme]
Yo, guess what
Bare man fi get the elbow drop
Ballhead, canerow or French crop
Durag, afro or high top
Serious, guess what
Bare man fi get the elbow drop
Ballhead, canerow or French crop
Durag, afro or high top

Clack, clack, what? Clack clack

Mandem are Jack [?] and I'm ripper
Flowing and going and getting bigger and bigger
And I pull the trigger [?]

[Verse 4: Scratchy]
B-U-N
Lyrics to lyrics, you get B-U-N
Back to back, you get B-U-N
Face to face, you get B-U-N
Switch it up? Aight then, B-U-N again
Dun your dance, it's B-U-N again
Lord of the Mics 3, 4, 5, 6
7, 8, 9, 10, get B-U-N again

[Verse 5: Lay-Z]
OK, your bars are dead, your flow's dead
Your creps are dead, your clothes are dead
Your girl's dead, your hairline's dead
Go to your barber and tell him what I said
Go to your dad, tell him what I said
Make him look at this waste MC that he bred
About you wanna stand up inna war
Lay-Z, I paint the whole town red

[Verse 6: Sox]
Winning and chilling
All day, every day, chilling and winning
Spend weekends with different women
I make P from spitting these lyrics on riddims
Fly like a G6, hype on the remix
Us man are making a killing
I do nothing but winning and chilling
All day, every day, chilling and winning

[Verse 7: Flowdan]
Dem bwoy ah go die
On a long ting, no lie
No more Mr Nice Guy, why?
[?] thought man was a nice man
So they come and take liberties with Flowdan
Dem never know man was a smart man
Couple grand, that makes you a dead man
One phone call will send for the iceman
He will freeze and no names get mentioned
