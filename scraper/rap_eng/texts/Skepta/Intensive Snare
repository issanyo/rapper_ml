[Intro]
Go on then
Lighter
Are ya stupid!
Skepta and, and, Forward
Skepta
It's not you it's me
Plasticman
Are ya stupid?
Blud
Are you stupid in the nose, bassline in ya nostril
Some chestplate business
More than grime
Rock ya headtop
Bassline
Meridian
Ok, FORWARD!
Go on then, go on then

[Chorus]
Lemme see ya lighters in the air
Are you stupid in the face?
Check the intensive snare
The hi-hats, treble and bass
Lemme see ya lighters in the air
Are you stupid in the face?
Check the intensive snare
The hi-hats, treble and bass

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna keep spittin' 'til Geeneus kicks me off Rinse
Might see me with the east side prince
Might see me in a blue car with tints
Might see this monkey in the Ghetto
With no Trim, taking out the garbage
If I hear ya chat greeze
I'll come to your ends and cause Maximum Karnage
Boy Better Know this, my name's Joseph
My name's Skepta, my name's Junior
See in school man I used to hit boys with a ruler
The English teacher tried make me hoover
But I'm a badboy from Nigeria
Not St. Lucia
Joseph Junior Adenuga
Big lips, African hooter
Go on then, go on then

[Chorus]
Lemme see ya lighters in the air
Are you stupid in the face?
Check the intensive snare
The hi-hats, treble and bass
Lemme see ya lighters in the air
Are you stupid in the face?
Check the intensive snare
The hi-hats, treble and bass

[Verse 2]
The level I'm on they wanna reach this
'Cause when I touch mic I'm the deepest
I'm the strongest, you're the weakest
I'm on the A-list
You're still strugglin' to get up on the C-list
I'll chop an MC into pieces
I'm a badman, you're a penis
And your whole crew stink like faeces
But now check the remix
You see the level I'm on they wanna be on
Cos I'm a star and I shine like neon
Lyrically gun a man down like Leon
And you're a wasteman
So there's a lot of things we can't agree on
You got a big tune, put me on
I'm on a badman ting, what's he on?
Drive to your house in a Ford Orion
Draw for the tool
Go on then, go on then, go on then

[Chorus]
Lemme see ya lighters in the air
Are you stupid in the face?
Check the intensive snare
The hi-hats, treble and bass
Lemme see ya lighters in the air
Are you stupid in the face?
Check the intensive snare
The hi-hats, treble and bass

[Bridge]
Skepta, Plasticman
More than grime
The hi-hats treble and bass
Hold tight all the crew who know 'bout up in the air
Skepta, picky afro
But you know what?

[Verse 3]
If you paid your money to see me slew
Get a refund and drive home safely
Or shut ya mouth and stop cryin' like a baby
Want me to keep on slewin' MCs 'til I'm 80
Nah, please don't hate me
I'm still gonna say "Draw for the tool"
"What'ya mean you fool", "take off my jacket"
"God forgive me" you know all of the classics
Cos when you compare my bars to a mash
I spray like a MAC10, not a deuce deuce
I made that boy there beg for a truce
He wanted to clash me until I started hurlin' abuse
And then he realised there's no use
He just hung himself with his own noose
I hold the power like Zeus
And when I touch mic in the dance all hell breaks loose
Go on then

[Chorus] (x3)
Lemme see ya lighters in the air
Are you stupid in the face?
Check the intensive snare
The hi-hats, treble and bass
Lemme see ya lighters in the air
Are you stupid in the face?
Check the intensive snare
The hi-hats, treble and bass
