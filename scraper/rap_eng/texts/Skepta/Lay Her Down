Beres Hammond?, let's check out something fresh. Homegrown talent by the name of Skepta, this is called "Lay Her Down" and I'm feeling it, it's big, let's go

[Verse 1]
You’re telling people you don’t like me
Real killers never make a sound
All my niggas beside me
Shoot that motherfucker down
This pretty lady said she likes me
But she heard I get around
So when I see her
I swear to Jesus, I'm a lay her down

[Hook]
I'm a lay her down, lay her down
I'm a lay her down, lay her down
I'm a lay her down, lay her down
I'm a lay her down, lay her down
