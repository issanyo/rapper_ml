[Verse]
They wanna know my name? OK
Let me introduce myself
I'm PK and I've got a bait face
But nobody really knows me well
I'm a different type of don, you can tell
Won't back down and I will not fail
Grinding everyday feels like hell
But I know one day, that'll pay me well
So I jump on the riddim and I murk it well
140BPM, I excel, got
Nuttin' to lose, yeah, who wanna clash this dude? Yeah
Call me the boogeyman, scaring youts, yeah
Worst nightmare on the track or the tune, yeah
Tings get sticky like nursery glue
Have an MC running like Scooby Doo
Now man are asking "where are you?"
Ayy, what, you think you're the realest of dudes
Just 'cause you shot some food?
Dem man are shook, they're moving like Scooby Doo cartoons
Who would have thought that dem man are Puss in Boots?
I would, fam, I can smell that poo
How can your girl be braver than you?
That cheeky girl, she sends me nudes
She got the fat backs but I like them boobs
She got the tattoo on her ankle
Know what you're thinking, PK's rude
The Mexican lad, the Mexican dude
I'll wrap man señorita smooth, oi, what can I do?
Quick ting, mad ting, man have gotta move
If you've got a problem, know where to find man
Frontline, chef up your belly like stew, like
Little PK and I'm out on the road
I'm just tryna find my way back home
On my way home from a great show
Leng down shows, I'm a P-R-O
Man wanna war like GI Joe?
OK, let me murk man with the yosho
Tell your boy don't get involved cuh
That's not wise or sensible
Yeah, that'll be a problem that you can't solve
Or I'll twist man up like Kurt Angle and you
Can't stand up cuh your ankle's broke, I'm a
Dangerous bloke, better mind how you talk
Keep the backchat to a minimal
'Cause I send MCs to the Holy Grail
Tings get hot like Hell in the Cell
'Cause I can't let an MC take my belt
You know me, PK, little IC3
Dem feds dere still wanna nick me, but
I will never let these jakes catch me 'cause I
Move like a fox in the night, I creep, when I
See police, I'm off on my feet, they wanna
Google man and try to search me and
Lock man up like a can of baked beans
'Cause the pagan IB snitched on me
Can't trust anyone these days on the streets
Dem man dere will snitch for the Ps and
Next ting you know, you'll be in the bully van and the
Crown Court but I'm not guilty
So fuck the jury, I just wanna be free
I just wanna make Ps with all my Gs
So when I'm on the road, I know the undies
So I tell dem kids get away from me like
When I'm on the show, bun down the show
Everybody get down when I yosho
Gyal dem are skanking when I yosho
Mandem are waving when I yosho like
When I'm on the show, bun down the show
Everybody get down when I yosho
Gyal dem are skanking when I yosho
Mandem are waving when I yosho like
Camden back roads where you don't go
'Cause the mandem are anti, very loco
Got a hot head, out for the bread and dough
Snatch your necklace, take that gold
Won't let that go, in the C-A-M, we keep it sho
Tings go down like a slippery slope, don't
Get me cross like tic-tac-toe
Man can't roll on me, he'll get smoked
Turn man's head into beans on toast
Scramble your egg, man ah fry that yolk
You should know my flow is cold
So cold, man ah call this flow Moscow
So man better wear their warmest coat
Cuh it might just snow when I enter the show and get a reload
Man can't come against King Yosho like
Left foot, right foot, man are from the C-A-M
Shoot from the middle like C-A-M
D-E-N, that's my ends
Know when I'm on the ball, I was like
Left foot, right foot, man are from the C-A-M
Shoot from the middle like C-A-M
D-E-N, that's my ends
Know when I'm on the ball
These MCs are pars, can't chief me up
Not on the hairs of my billy goat gruff
IC3, I'm a little bit rough
Camden don from the North West slums
Camden's known for the dodgiest stuff
Where the mandem move like the wickedest goths
Come to the blocks and you'll see wah gwan
Slice and dice right into your guts, yuck
Now you've got a holey top
Now you've gotta go and pray to the gods
Tings get tense like sweaty bums
Alibi if they ask: I was at my mum's
I've gotta leave this road ting alone
'Cause I don't wanna end up stuck in the slums
I just wanna make bare Ps and funds
Make- with the- and have some fun
