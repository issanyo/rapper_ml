Work every day 'til me meet ends

I know there's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times

[Verse 1: Skepta]
I just spent four nights in the trap
Tryna get racks on racks
More than a hundred missed calls
And I didn't call one of them back
Now I'm in the club with the gang
And we're all dressed in black
The traphouse closed for the weekend
Man are gonna be right back
Thought it was all about fame
Don't hide your feelings when you see me on stage
I got a first class ticket to the top
And no, you can't stop that plane
It's the Boy Better Know campaign
Every day we pop champagne
Celebrate life like Christmas Day
Don't care about what a man's saying

[Pre-Hook: Popcaan]
Work every day 'til me meet ends
Haffi tun it up pon weekends
Buss a toast, be a real friend
Tell me weh yuh drinking, cah
Work every day 'til me meet ends
Haffi tun it up pon weekends
Buss a toast, be a real friend
Tell me weh yuh drinking, cah

[Hook: The Persuasions]
I know there's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good
I know there's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good

[Verse 2: Frisco]
No more bills on my conscience
Man have been puttin' in work constant
Celebratin' life with my dargs dem
We've been having us a real nigga conference
Laughin' and jokin', smokin' the highest grade
I stay clean in the baddest apparel
Tryna stay far from the crab in the barrel
If I make it rain, you will need more than a flannel
Call off, I don't wanna pop a tool off and tell a hater goodbye
Look at my mum, she's smilin', my team's flyin'
So right now, it's good times
Two middle fingers up to those
That told me that I shouldn't chase my dream
But now man are shinin', you're silent
My man ain't sayin' nothin', he's Mr. Bean, it's all good though

[Pre-Hook: Popcaan]
Work every day 'til me meet ends
Haffi tun it up pon weekends

Work every day 'til me meet ends

I know there's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good
I know there's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good times
There's gonna be good

[Verse 3: Skepta + Frisco]
Yeah yeah, you know that it's OTF
Me and the mandem, and the ladies too
Tonight's gonna be a movie, better bring Martin Scorsese through
I'm wavy, who's gonna try, but your late-arse sentence
Get restored back to your factory settings
Man's never been in London when it's shutdown
She's gonna lose her mind when I touchdown
Cause by the way my tracksuit droppin'
She can see that I just went shoppin'
Them niggas don't like us around here
Tell the security I'm bringin' my whole block in
Raise your glass to my team for blazin' up the scene, and we ain't plannin' on stoppin'
Tell the bar owner it's time for a lock-in
And we ain't goin' home 'til the law comes knockin'

[Pre-Hook: Popcaan]
