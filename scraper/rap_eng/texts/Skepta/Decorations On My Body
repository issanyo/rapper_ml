They say they like my ink, I say that I’m flattered
They ask me where I been, I say I been getting tatted
They say they like my ink, I say that I’m flattered
They ask me where I been, I say I been getting tatted
I been getting tatted on the regular
Decorations on my body I can't get enough
Fuck a sleeve, I need me a jumper
I ain't gonna stop till I'm covered up

[Verse 1: Skepta]
23 hours on my left arm
19 hours on right my arm
42 hours on my torso, my nigga I'm calm
Tell the police, "Come get me". Nigga, it's Grevious Bodily Harm
Mum said, "What 'bout when you wanna get a nine to five?", I told her, "I made it"
In a white vest screaming get ink now before you die naked
They say no alcohol before you get a tattoo, but I'm intoxicated
Back in a tattoo chair, touching up a tat that looks kind of faded
Now I’m in bed with the wife
And all I can think about is
How much I’m in love with the needle
Funny noises at night in my house
And it sounds like Resident Evil
New tattoo on my chest, so when I wear V-necks I rep my people
I'm a true Nigerian, let me put some more Bapanthen on my eagle
London city on my belly I’m facing my fears
24-7, I’m getting inked up
Them niggas are thinkin' up ideas
I’ma take this pain, until I pass out or I shed some tears
Doing it then , doing it now, doing it again
I'll be doing it for years
Sexy! Yeah!

They say they like my ink, I say that I’m flattered
They ask me where I been, I say I been getting tatted
They say they like my ink, I say that I’m flattered
They ask me where I been, I say I been getting tatted
I been getting tatted on the regular
Decorations on my body I can't get enough
Fuck a sleeve, I need me a jumper
I ain't gonna stop till I'm covered up

[Verse 2: Chip]
Always on time, you see the clock on my chest
Three quarter length shorts, see the tat on my leg
Check my ink game, none of my ink sprays
Niggas heard about rakky, they want to connect
Man, I run shit, you can call me in(k) charge
Girls gassed off my skin, I call it in(k) charm
Influential, Sonny? I'm that guy
And your chick's got tats just to match mine!
Independent paper, yellow drain down rounds
Counting grands with them same hands now!
The right says believe, left says achieve
That’s why these niggas got their hands out
Tats by the hour, no slow thing
You got one tat? That’s a joke thing
I wanted new ink so I asked my income
She said "Chip, you're okay, go and get that ink done"

[Hook: Shalo]
They say they like my ink, I say that I’m flattered
They ask me where I been, I say I been getting tatted
They say they like my ink, I say that I’m flattered
They ask me where I been, I say I been getting tatted
I been getting tatted on the regular
Decorations on my body I can't get enough
Fuck a sleeve, I need me a jumper
I ain't gonna stop till I'm covered up
