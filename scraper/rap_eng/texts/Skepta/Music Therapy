[Intro: Gunna Dee]
Yeah
Gunna!

[Verse 1: Gunna Dee]
Music's my medication when I meditate (Yeah)
Celebrating that I'm still, here to celebrate
Its hard giving love, when you're living rough
Its like you can never give enough for them to never hate (Nah)
Niggas ungrateful
Give a nigga a plate, niggas still hate seeing your plate full (Yeah)
Niggas are hateful, but when your pockets full them same niggas wanna stay cool
You can stay cool in the freezer (Yeah)
Got killers with no visa
Niggas pray to jesus when they end up where my g's are
Little nerds wanna beef hood
Click of the mac, leave your back looking see-through
I ain't got no feelings, fuck how that nigga there feels (Yeah)
I'll have that nigga holding slugs like Bear Grylls
In my hood there's no smiles (Nah)
No smiles cause of rare meals (Yeah)
I'm in the hood, but the hood ain't where my plans are (Nah)
Big plans where my fans are
I've seen pussy niggas dying over petty shit (Yeah)
Cause in my hood disrespect is like cancer
Fuck a diss song, we've got guns that piss long (Yeah)
They'll be pissed your gone, when you get pissed on
Pussy niggas get pissed on
Piss my niggas off the pistols, where they piss from

[Chorus: Gunna Dee (Skepta)]
Smoking on that loud
Music is my therapy (Therapy)
Smoking on that ahhh
Sipping on that hennessy (Hennessy)
Smoking on that loud
Music is my therapy (Therapy)
Yeah
Smoking on that
Yeah
Sipping on that hennessy (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Skepta]
We ain't watching any police
Me and all my niggas we get plenty of p's (Uh Huh)
30 for the hennessy, 20 for the cheese
Got the cigarette, the rizla man are ready to breeze (Ayy)
On the motorway all them niggas play is Skeppy and Gunna (Yeah)
Another 100 grand and I'm ready for summer (Sexy)
I tell em' jump in the pool if your watch is real
I could swim 100 lengths my shit would be working still (Aha!)
I came in the game with the 8 ball, Â£400 and my tanita's (Ayy)
My line went dead, told myself I gotta get them features
Now you turn on the radio, its my voice you hear in the speakers
I feel to go to my old school, and say suck your mum to all of the teachers (Mental)
Wait!, I think that's weed on the phone let me grab my charger
Told the weed when you talk to me, talk to me like you talk to the headmaster
But this weed just started schooling me and I was so obedient
I wish Bob Marley was alive, I just wanna share this experience

[Chorus: Gunna Dee]
Smoking on that loud
Music is my therapy (Therapy)
Smoking on that ahhh
Sipping on that hennessy (Hennessy)
Smoking on that loud
Music is my therapy (Therapy)
Smoking on that
Sipping on that hennessy (Hennessy) x 5
