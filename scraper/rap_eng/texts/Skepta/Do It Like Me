[Intro]
Fuck Skepta
Fuck Skepta
Fuck Skepta
Let me hear you say fuck Skepta
Fuck Skepta
Fuck Skepta
Fuck Skepta
Fuck Skepta

[Verse 1]
He sold out
I sold out, yeah
There weren't one ticket left, not even a chair
I should send you a postcard, I wish you were here
I wish you could see, I wish you could hear
I make 'em scream
When I come through with the rest of the team
I get it popping mainstream, still I'm the best in the scene
So I can understand why everybody wants to do it like me
No you don't do it like me
Nah, no, we ain't the same
You're never gonna do it, I'm doin' it again
Boy Better Know, we're moving too fast
You better move into a different lane
Oh what a shame
They though I weren't gonna bust, then I came
Took off the condom, made it rain
Left my stain all over the game
And these wannabes wanna be me
They disrespect me then they beg me for a retweet
Then we see, them on the camera, walking, talking try'na do it like me
No you don't do it like me

[Hook x2]
I know a lot of man that think they do it like me
I know a lot of man that think they do it like me
They really, really, really think they do it like me
But they don't do it like me

[Verse 2]
You call it money, I call it a piece of paper
You think I'm a human being, nah man I'm a freak of nature
Skepta, I've got the UK buzzing like a vibrator
Now my paper's looking higher than a sky scraper
Chipmunk told me don't watch no face
So I never leave home without my pencil case
24/7, I stay with my eraser
Put it up in the sky, nice and high, wave it side to side
Screaming rub 'em out, rub 'em out
Goodbye hater
See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya
Fuck your mixtape, I don't wanna feature
Couldn't give a shit about your album either
I don't wanna hear you come out the speaker, no
You ain't been to a show until you been to my show
If you're looking for some action, man, I'm G.I Joe
I'm killing it, that's why them man are switching
They threw some dead punches, but I'm still alive and kicking
There's too many cooks in the kitchen, been tryna do it like me
No, you don't do it like me

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Guess who's in the city, it's going off
They know I got money, but I ain't showing off
I drop it like it's hot
Fuck how much dough it costs
We're blowing up
But you man are blowing off
Blad, you're blowing out
You told Logan your mix CD was finished
But you're constipated, your shit ain't coming out
Man know I've got sick beats, and crazy vocals
MCs don't wanna see me on the scene, I take it old school like
Nah rude boy, what d'ya mean, what d'ya mean, what d'ya mean you fool
Go on then, go on then, draw for the tool
Think that you're hard but you're soft like wool
I will lick a man in the jaw side with a stool
I'm a real bad boy but I still look cool
White gold chains and an iced out jewel
But they can't jack me because I'm not Ja Rule
Nah rude boy what d'ya mean, what d'ya mean?
I was born on September the 19th, don't care about February 14th
Pay me for my 16th before I start acting like it's Friday the 13th
With two black gloves and balaclava
CS gas and a meat cleaver
Pay me for my half hour
Before I start chopping off heads like King Arthur

[Interlude]
People here are starting to hail you as the king of grime, because you're the one person that has, stuck by this genre of music
I'm the, I'm the guy that really loves this music, I love grime bruvva
If there was a room, you get me, and a microphone and a PC lock me in there
I'm coming out with tunes, oh yeah maybe years old, yeah
But there ain't no-one else that does it like me

[Hook x2]
