[Hook]
Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Everything feels like touchdown on a rainy day
Part time love is the life 'round here
We're never done
Every--every---
Now weâ€™re at square one

[Verse 1]
Really I should be in the studio
But I'm in the club all the time
If you ever saw the way these girls dance on me, you would of put it on Vine
Both hands on the deck, she wants to give me that re-rewind
I said "yeah man, I'm feeling the "Pour It Up" video, but it ain't nasty as mine"
I don't wanna go private room, temperature's kinda high, I need to change climates soon
I'm going outside, I hope you don't think I'm trying to be rude
By the way you look nice, but I know you've got a name that you use in the night and a name for everyday life
So I've gotta ask you twice

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They ask me "how's life?"
TBH I'm sick of it - contradictions and hypocrites
Vegetarian, but I've got leather all in my kicks
Fucking hell, I think too much shit
Spit my verse first then tell a man "finish it"
Violent hoodie with my heart on my sleeve, I ain't gonna let nobody Kendrick me
Cause if you look inside of my soul, you can find pain
But there isn't anyone that I blame
Except myself and my name
I've got the girl of my dreams in front of me, but I'm a victim to this fame
Smoking weed, chest's hurting me, but I'm addicted to Miss Jane

[Hook]

[Bridge (x6)]
Touchdown, touchdown
Back to square one
