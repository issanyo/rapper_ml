[Intro: Blood Orange]
Racing down Ilford Lane going home
Thinking about should I try to fake a fall
You seem to think that you're all alone
And nothing ever could change it all
Think about the words that you said

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Yeah, silence on my estate
Cassette player chewed up my cassette tape
Blisters from the control pad
Cause I was on the Mega Drive more time

[Chorus: Skepta]
If you're feeling me put your Pinot Grigio high
This ones for my G's in the North side (Racing down Ilford Lane going home)
All my G's on the East side
This one for my G's in the West side (Thinking about should I try to fake a fall)
My G's on the South side

[Verse 2: Skepta]
The late king Michael Jackson doing the moonwalk on the telly
And I was like "who's bad?"
Sitting there smoking, sipping MD 20/20
Thinking I was the man
Mum's upset because I haven't given her a penny
But I just got a 20 bag
Mum don't stress, you know I told you already
I'mma do it for you and dad
So I was out on the grind
On the 279, trying to show my songs to the world
Inspired by the streets
Fell in love with the beats, I never had time for a girl
I never really cared about a hair cut
I was in the club doing the 2-step
Wishing it was me on the decks
Wanted to do it for the love, it took some
Perseverance and discipline
Couldn't wait to get the whole world listening
I remember when I first went radio
I couldn't believe it was in the kitchen
Your mixing and reality kicks in
Smoking to calm my nerves and settle me down
It feels like I'm in a crystal maze
Somebody give Richard crystal and get me out
In 1 mile I've seen 2 fights
Blue tape, blue lights
Single mom struggling with the push chair?
She had a bad mouth but she had good hair
Stole a phone in the shop getting looked at
Barbershop, hairline's getting pushed back
Guys looking at me like they wanna fight me
Just another day on the high street
Yeah, and now I'm back on the estate
My CD keeps skipping when I press play
Four memory cards full of music
Cause I was on the PlayStation more time

[Chorus]
