[Intro]
He wanna know who, it's Sharky Major
I grind hard for the yakhi paper
Should know 'bout me from back in the day
When I used to spray with today's stars on Déjà
There ain't nobody greater
Yeah

[Hook]
When Shark attacks, they can't react
Heartbeats increase and it becomes hard to relax
I'll forever stay large
Different class, in fact, for the bars
When Shark attacks, they can't react
Control the mic like a spitter in charge
Me, I'm not any one of these dargs
Some ah talk hard when they are nothing but soft

[Bridge]
Darg, the ocean ain't big enough for two of us
Yeah, it's Jerome on my own, my ting, I do it, love
Paper-pursuing, ask certain man what they're doing
They'll say nothing, I'm on the property ladder and moving up

[Verse 1]
Yeah, this game, I'm still a star in
I went years without barring
Still stand strong in the square with any of these MC brehs
He wants to stay clear
He's bars king when he ain't near and I'm laughing
Like haha, oh please, his flows ain't enchanted
'Nuff MCs chat a whole bag of greaze
But what they release still needs enhancing
Man are hungry for the beats, I'm starving
Just like I did two weeks of fasting
And you know say I do eat, man are true beast
You can ask him
I'm unique, different category I'm classed in
Technically outclassed him
Boss like Rick Ross while they bitch a lot like secretaries
Me, I ain't begging 'em, please
I'm advanced and ahead of their league, I get MCs
One phone call if it's a lone shark ting
I roll call young gunner or old school
Don't tek man for no fool
Might see my chrome blasting
Cross the line, there's no rules, no talking
No question-asking
The roads ain't sweet and nuttin' ain't free
Like being in a city with parking

[Hook]
When Shark attacks, they can't react
Heartbeats increase and it becomes hard to relax
I'll forever stay large
Different class, in fact, for the bars
When Shark attacks, they can't react
Control the mic like a spitter in charge
Me, I'm not any one of these dargs
Some ah talk hard when they are nothing but soft

[Bridge]
Darg, the ocean ain't big enough for two of us
Yeah, it's Jerome on my own, my ting, I do it, love
Paper-pursuing, ask certain man what they're doing
They'll say nothing, I'm on the property ladder and moving up

[Verse 2]
So I back the flow up, governor for the show
If you want, we can bet, double up for your dough
If you're doubting Jerome and the way that I'm sounding
Like this scene I ain't renowned in
That night, your Ps will get the rounds in
You're not that guy, on a mad hype
On the track, why? To me, that's a clown ting
Chuck it with me, most definitely get spun
I heard your talk 'bout you move with the whole heat
But there won't be nobody, no OG
Phoning me up like "bro, you should allow them"
Lyrically, I'm expounding
This ain't your scene, leave these surroundings
Too many MCs screaming and shouting horribly
No quality, it bothers me
Cause they talk like they're in the league of the crowned kings
Squash that, it's Major
One of the grime scene greatest
Might think I flopped cause I fell off the radars
I was on top of getting my papers
Raised the stakes, now I take lots of weighters
Ain't a baiders but I've got
A whole wardrobe full of [?] trainers
And I live life like I'm famous
Might book a flight out to Vegas

[Hook]
When Shark attacks, they can't react
Heartbeats increase and it becomes hard to relax
I'll forever stay large
Different class, in fact, for the bars
When Shark attacks, they can't react
Control the mic like a spitter in charge
Me, I'm not any one of these dargs
Some ah talk hard when they are nothing but soft

[Bridge]
Darg, the ocean ain't big enough for two of us
Yeah, it's Jerome on my own, my ting, I do it, love
Paper-pursuing, ask certain man what they're doing
They'll say nothing, I'm on the property ladder and moving up

[Bridge]
Darg, the ocean ain't big enough for two of us
Yeah, it's Jerome on my own, my ting, I do it, love
Paper-pursuing, ask certain man what they're doing
They'll say nothing, I'm on the property ladder and moving up

[Outro]
Over here, it's Sharky Major
I grind hard for the yaki paper
Should know 'bout me from back in the day
When I used to spray with today's stars on Déjà
It's Sharky Major
I grind hard for the yaki paper
Should know 'bout me from back in the day
When I used to spray with today's stars on Déjà
I swear it's too easy
Shark Major
You know
Skeppy on the beat
