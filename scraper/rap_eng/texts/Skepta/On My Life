[Intro: Konan & Skepta]
They don't want no smoke
They don't want no smoke
They don't want no smoke
They don't want no smoke (Greeze!)

[Verse 1: Krept]
My akhiâ€™s on alert, savage ain't the word
Twenty niggas deep, man ain't getting searched
Acting like a bitch, panties and a skirt
I beg you suck your mum, you prick, and go and mash your work
Chatting in your verse, you rappers got a nerve
Knocking niggas out, man are on the verge
I know you seen the whips, call me Matt when I skrrt
Bitch, what you doing? Get your hand off the Merc
Whole end's screaming free TK
Man was really in the ends where the Gs stay
Had Amazon while she was surfing eBay
Boy, boy, shot sounded like a replay
Better call me Matt now
I'm like vroom, whip's worth like a flat now
They're like hmm, clap nigga with the plaits, how?
Check my Snap and zoom, that's your Mrs in the background, pussy

[Chorus]
On my life, they don't want no smoke (behave)
They don't want no smoke (pussy)
They don't want no smoke (ba-boom)
They don't want no smoke (greaze)
On my life, they don't want no smoke (skrr-skrr)
They don't want no smoke (ayy)
They don't want no smoke
They don't want no smoke

[Verse 2: Konan]
They can't cope, they don't want no smoke
Catch him on the road, be like "fam, I ain't involved"
Comfy on my own
Looking at my watches like "I could've bought a home"
Free the mandem, sipping Magnum
In the dance with a big spliff, Buju Banton
Fuckboys throwing tantrums, on my Samson
Not my fault that your babymum thinks I'm handsome
On a stage with a hundred man, better understand
Tryna book us for your festival? That's a hundred grand
Niggas think they're in wonderland with a couple fans
Till we have you in your Air Max doing the running man
Buss your head with an E&J, now I can see your brain
Had this nitty on my Penge line, looked like Peter Kay
I brought weed with my EMA, fuck Theresa May
I brought weed with my EMA, fuck Theresa May (kaboom)

[Chorus]
On my life, they don't want no smoke (behave)
They don't want no smoke (pussy)
They don't want no smoke (ba-boom)
They don't want no smoke (greaze)
On my life, they don't want no smoke (skrr-skrr)
They don't want no smoke (ayy)
They don't want no smoke (greaze)
They don't want no smoke

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Yeah, I talk to dead people on a daily basis
Everyday I look around, same familiar faces
Multicultural gang, million races
Fuck mid Brexit, them niggas is racist
I bought my dad a house, that's what niggas do
Mum got jealous so I got her one too
Told that boy I don't wanna kick it, I don't wanna learn kung fu
But if your girlfriend texts me, I'ma tell her come through
Give her that anaconda, I'ma give her that Jake the snake
Put her to sleep, in the morning, give her that wake and bake
Think you're a big boy now? You stay up late?
I was in the lion's den when you was playing Snake
Such a fucking snake, you love to hate
I still have my asthma pump, and I ain't never tucked my chain
This a one-of-one, custom-made
Mum says I've gone crazy, I'm just stuck in my ways

[Chorus]
On my life, they don't want no smoke (behave)
They don't want no smoke (pussy)
They don't want no smoke (ba-boom)
They don't want no smoke (greaze)
On my life, they don't want no smoke (skrr-skrr)
They don't want no smoke (ayy)
They don't want no smoke
They don't want no smoke
