[Verse 1: Stefflon Don]
So this likkle brudda wanna be the man
Sliding in my DM's on Instagram
I don't know if he know who the fuck I am
But somebody best tell him who the fuck I am
She's Stefflon Don, 5'5"
Big tits, brown eyes
See them dick pics? She ain't really 'bout that life
She'll gun buck your mum then slap your wife
Oh, I got bruddas waiting at the door
Couple more bruddas down the road on the floor
Oh, pussy getting double encores
This pussy ain't never been on tour
Still pussy get wetter than a seashore
Diced pineapples make him wanna eat more
Fuckin' up some commas in pyjamas if a bredda bring the drama, I'ma bring the llama, do it like Obama

[Chorus]

Ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling

I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
Ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
Ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling
I want you to play with my

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah
Me and my girl in matching hoodies, that's autumn winter
She don't wanna build and link up
Nah, she's is not inna that mix up
Them artist could not draw this picture
Sex so good, I forgot to eat
Sex so good, I forgot to sleep
This is my princess, this ain't a bitch
Your ting needs to put on the leash
Don't put me in that competition
Man, like me, I'm in pole position
Walked in a dance like spot, the difference
Gold chain looking like a pot to piss in
We nearly went separate ways
But I made a grown decision
We let bygones be bygones
We do not go to vision

[Chorus: Stefflon Don]
Ding-a-ling
(Nuff man wan' me fi ride me 'pon the ting)
Ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling

I want you to play with my ding-a-ling
('Cause you ain't the bitch, you da Don Dada)
Ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling

I want you to play with my
