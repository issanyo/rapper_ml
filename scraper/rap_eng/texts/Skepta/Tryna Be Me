[Intro: Playboi Carti]
I ain't worried 'bout no bitch
I just want some sex, I just want some sex, honestly
You know what I'm saying?

I might be in Toronto next week, I'm all-over the place bitch
Ayy, Cash Carti, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Money bags (I can't serve you)
Money bags (I can't serve you)
Money bags (I can't serve you)
Money bags (I can't serve you)

[Refrain: Playboi Carti]
Young niggas tryna be me
Young niggas tryna be me

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I ain't worried 'bout no bitch, I just want some sex
I ain't worried 'bout these niggas, I just need a check, aye
My babymama say I'm up, I told that bitch I'm next, aye
Banging with my brothers, aye, banging with no others, aye
I bust that pussy down and I pass it to my brother, aye
Yeah, aye, it was just the other day
Walgreens in the flat, tryna bring some back
Front porch with straps, you ain't from the fucking trap

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Aye, I can't serve you I can't serve you was on the corner trippin'
I can't serve you, my young niggas on the come-up, aye
Alexander McQueen, boy I tuck it in my vest
Young Carti been ballin', bitch, nothin' but net
Bad bitch she came over, she came, yeah
Bad bitch she came over, gave a young nigga neck (I got it)
Took his bitch to my crib, yeah that hoe so impressed
And I start pourin', and I start pourin'
Then I start pourin', that bitch started to undress
And you know this ice, and you know this ice
Boy you know this ice around my neck, I don't wanna speak
Boy you know I keep a fucking Tec, boy, talk is cheap
Boy I keep that on the seat, foreign drive by, sheesh
Now them boys hatin' boy, I don't fuck with pussy boys
Aye, aye, aye
Probably catch me in a foreign, going to where the money going

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I ain't worried 'bout no bitch, I just want some sex
I ain't worried 'bout these niggas, I just need a check, aye
My babymama say I'm up, I told that bitch I'm next, aye
Banging with my brothers, aye, banging with no others, aye
I bust that pussy down and I pass it to my brother, aye
Yeah, aye, it was just the other day
Walgreens in the flat, tryna bring some back
Front porch with straps, you ain't from the fucking trap
Walgreens in the flat, tryna bring some back
Front porch with straps, you ain't from the fucking trap

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Aye, aye
We never see these pussy hoes, only see these checks
Say you getting stacks, but most of your Gs in debt
I see your bitch checking out your clothes
And I don't think she's impressed
Oh, what this tee right here?
Nah, they ain't released this yet
But that's a mad ting right here
I'm killing these niggas bring some flowers
Nah this ain't a regular pack
I'm smoking some different powers
Niggas in that cellular antics
You working with some different powers
Put your girl in a single mattress
On my dick for hours
I told her wait, one sec get off me
Your hands are way too low, nah you ain't doing it properly
Fuck this bullshit, let's get back to the money scheme
Feel like I'ma die soon, man I keep getting funny dreams
Told your baby mama to hide the weapon in the buggy, please
That's my nigga with the dreads and the dungarees
Pull up to the show with a hundred Gs
Got niggas buzzin' like some bumble bees
They never trouble me, nah
I ain't worried bout no bitch

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I ain't worried 'bout no bitch, I just want some sex
I ain't worried 'bout these niggas, I just need a check, aye
My babymama say I'm up, I told that bitch I'm next, aye
Banging with my brothers, aye, banging with no others, aye
I bust that pussy down and I pass it to my brother, aye
Yeah, aye, it was just the other day
Walgreens in the flat, tryna bring some back
Front porch with straps, you ain't from the fucking trap
Walgreens in the flat, tryna bring some back
Front porch with straps, you ain't from the fucking trap

[Outro: Playboi Carti]
It was the other day, it was the other day
It was the other day, damn, yeah, uh, yeah
I ain't worried, yeah, uh, how could I worry, yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't worried, yeah yeah. hold on
(Walgreens in the flat, tryna bring some back
Front porch with straps, you ain't from the fucking trap)
