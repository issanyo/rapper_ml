You're telling people you don't like me
We don't kill this, never make a sound
All money get beside me
Shoot that motherfucker down
It's 30 ladies and she likes me
But she love that beating around
So when I see her
I swear to Jesus

I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her

Don't need to say you love me 10 times
I can feel it in the air
I just wanna be yours every night
And you can be my Jesse well
Dreams of this queen inside my bedroom
Wearing nothing but a crown
Oh when I see her
I swear to Jesus

I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her

Uh, get fresh then I step back
Beat the red button crip yea
So many girls around, yell around
You with a fuck, it was queue profound
Down down down down down I lay er
If my girl a Buffy then I slay er
And if the judge, girl my dick like KT
Purvey then they after John Layer
I sweat to Jesus, no pieces
I cut to bullshit, no pieces
We're both finna whistle and flip this now
Fuck yo, but kinda risich
Young and so now we in the set
Got the man them on deck
Put the gyal to move here
AMG livin, cruise damage on the M
One when I come vrum vrum

I'mma lay her down
I just wanna feel her skin
Against mine
If it's the last thing I do
I swear toâ€¦ I swear to Jesus

I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her down, lay her down
I'mma lay her

I sweat to
I sweat to
Yea, I sweat to Jesus
I'mma lay her down
