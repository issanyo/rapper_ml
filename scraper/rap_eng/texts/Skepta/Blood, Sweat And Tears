[Hook 1]
What did Bob Marley sing for
What did Rosa Parks fight for
If we're gonna kill each other anyway
If we're gonna kill each other anyway

[Verse 1 : Skepta]
'Cause if Martin Luther King saw Vybz Kartel hit Ninja at Sting he would've told Adams to lock up the whole ting
'Cause if you wanna sing then sing
But if you wanna be some Rocky Balboa then put on your boxing gloves and jump in the boxing ring
Exactly, that's what I thought
You're not a Mike Tyson, you're more like a Don King blud
We need to stop all the fighting, stop the stabbing
Stop the shooting, guns
Everyday mums are losing sons
14 year old kids are bagging up Q's and crumbs
And I don't think Mr Wilberforce would've killed a North man cause he was from East
Start looking at each other as brothers
Stick together, increase the peace

[Hook 2]
What did Bob Marley sing for
What did Rosa Parks fight for
If we're gonna kill each other anyway
If we're gonna kill each other anyway
Tell me what did Haile Selassie preach for
What did Malcolm X die for
If we're gonna kill each other anyway
If we're gonna kill each other anyway

[Verse 2 : Shorty]
It's like these guys play too much xbox
Shooting guys in the headtops
Think that I sound like a fed boss
But I'm sick of the gun talk, get lost
I'm not telling you how to live life though
Just put down your gun and your knife bro
Taking a next man's life ain't blessed and 25 years in the cells not live fool
I know life's not easy, so why you making it harder
Once you die there ain't no after
Life's not a ITV drama
You might think I sound like a preacher
Nah Shorty's more like a teacher
So rudeboy put down your guns and think with your brain and not with your heater

[Hook 2]
What did Bob Marley sing for
What did Rosa Parks fight for
If we're gonna kill each other anyway
If we're gonna kill each other anyway
Tell me what did Haile Selassie preach for
What did Malcolm X die for
If we're gonna kill each other anyway
If we're gonna kill each other anyway

[Verse 3 : JME]
People must think it's funny
The youth of today handling firearms like it's nothing
Taking lives, over drugs and money
Back when I was a kid all I wanted was Scalextric
But all these millennium kids wanna take your life cause you're from next bits
What happened to playing pogs and marbles and conkers
There's a new game they play now, and it's called go bonkers
That's what the adults call it, but we ain't saying it right
'Cause the kids got a better name for it, and they call it life

[Hook 2]
What did Bob Marley sing for
What did Rosa Parks fight for
If we gonna kill each other anyway
If we gonna kill each other anyway
Tell me what did Haile Selassie preach for
What did Malcolm X die for
If we're gonna kill each other anyway
If we're gonna kill each other anyway
