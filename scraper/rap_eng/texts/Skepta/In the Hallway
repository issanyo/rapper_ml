[Hook: Tre Mission]
You see me with some trapping ass niggas
I be with some trapping ass niggas
This is for my trapping ass niggas
They just tryna get this money all day, choppers in the hallway
I'm talking trapping ass niggas
I be with some trapping ass niggas
This is for my trapping ass niggas
They just tryna get this money all day, choppers in the hallway
Trapping ass niggas

[Verse 1: Tre Mission]
It's the life that we chose
I did a good job when it came to concealing my pain
But it's likely it shows
Trust me, I know what it's like being broke
Niggas hate, so they wanna fight me and throw
Shots online cause I'm hot online
Till I pull up on a nigga that's not online
If he's not one of mine, he's likely at fault
Living as a young black boy in the system
They tried to lead me to Christ but I dissed him
He was too distant, I couldn't relate to his pigment
But I still soaked in the wisdom
My niggas been through it all, where's his been?
Stole a connect from a has-been
Just tryna get to a ki like an admin
[?] back beans like popping an apsirin
Trust me, there's no stopping the trapping
If money is a common attraction
Let it go around, can't stop the reaction
I just wanna be on top of the fraction
Living so fast, if I stop, then I'm crashing
Hmm, one more time
I just wanna be on top of the fraction
Living so fast, if I stop, then I'm crashing

[Verse 2: Tre Mission]
That's what I came up with
I've got friends that came up quick
Some of them fell, but they came up rich
If you ask anybody on the strip, they'll tell you
A few had a plan that fell through
They pressed triggers but they've taken the L too
Stand right next to the grocery and sell food
Imagine the irony
As you banter and trade for the ivory
I was wondering deeply what I could be
If I had crack dealer inside of me
I never knew my dad, but he knew this life
Either way, he'd still take pride in me
He told me to watch my friends
But I told him "it's cool, they'll ride for me"
No lie, me and my niggas, we've been getting so high
Still on point, gotta keep a close eye
Couple of 'em got it but you wouldn't guess which
We don't want no problems but we keep it close by
If money is a common attraction
Let it go around, can't stop the reaction
I just wanna be on top of the fraction
Living so fast, if I stop, then I'm crashing

[Verse 3: Skepta]
While these niggas talk shit, me and my team working
I tell my G "turn off the TV, I don't wanna see Miley twerking"
You smell that dro? Was it tickling your nose? Yeah, man, that's my weed burning
You feeling the wave? Well, you like what you see and man, that's my team surfing
Spent years in T tryna stay away from feds and the DVLA
Forget the Hollywood dream, now I jump in the Benz if I wanna see LA
Told Mummy that I'm gonna be OK, leaving in peace, can't thank God enough
Now they're telling me that they want the old Skepta
Fuck the old Skepta, he shouts too much
And he can't write better than the new me
Niggas talk shit, but they never knew me
Look at all the bullshit I've been through, G
So-called beef but they never shoot me
A million girls in the venue to see
But I step into the club and man turn groupie
You didn't wanna fight me like you said in your tweets
Now you've seen me with
