[Hook x2]
I'm B.I.G
Man wanna screw me because I MC
If you ever saw what the skeng done to the tree
You definitely wouldn't be looking at me
Madness

[Verse 1: Skepta]
One two three four
You man better jam like a rebore
You will get left on the concrete floor
All you be hearing is ne-nor ne-nor
It's not a joke
No Eddie Murphy Raw
You must've been smoking on that P4
Cause if you ever saw what we saw
You wouldn't look me up and down like a see-saw
Check it out Azzi
Test it out Solo
Test it out KJ
Test it out
I know it's working proper now
So it's not a joke when I take it out
Pull it out, shot one of my eyes and press it out
No practice
But every time I spit a verse and an ad-lib
My names on everybody's lips like ChapStick
Me, D and P stick
With the metal like a magnet it's a madness

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Dubz]
If you saw what the .4 done to the car door
You wouldn't be acting hardcore, trust me
I've got a big 45 that's rusty
I got it from my OG who loves me
I beat it at the youts that rush me
You could call me Bumpy, cause I bump Ps
And I get my knock on like rugby
And my swaggers insane, you're dusty
You lot are dutty
You dress all the same
Skepta Ed Hardy all the way
You see Dubz in Christian Audigier
I'm on the block where the ballers stay
You're at home watching porn, you're gay
I let the champagne pour
Your gang make money but my gang make more
That's why we're on a champagne tour

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Paper Pablo]
You know I buy Glocks and I grind rocks
When I'm go on street when I go inside the shops
Fresh to the feet you can see designer socks
Buy Gucci creps, these niggas buy Shocks
If this was Belly then I would be Ox
My pape's long like Big H locks
Yeah you know a nigga top notch
When I drawed for the skeng shit you went and got cops
These niggas call CrimeStoppers
No days off, we full time shotters
I'm on the block like shub
That watch looks good next time Globetrotters
You know I'm P.A.V
Girls wanna screw me because I make P
She's sipping on MD plus she on an E
But me? Just Dom P, champers
