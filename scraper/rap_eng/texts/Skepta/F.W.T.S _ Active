[Part 1: "F.W.T.S" produced by ADP]

[Hook: Konan]
Don't know my name? Ask your girl
Came from the ground up, hell
If they really got a problem, tell em oh well
Stressed out over their hating? Well, we ain't got a care in the world
Cause we don't give a fuck what they say, fuck what they say
Nigga, we don't give a fuck what they say, fuck what they say
Nigga, we don't give a fuck what they say, fuck what they say
Nigga, we don't give a fuck what they say, fuck what they say
Nigga, we don't give a fuck what they say

[Verse 1: Krept]
Police stopped me, asked to search my whip
Said if you ain't got no grounds, you ain't searching shit
Tell a nigga buy some bottles, they'll be under pressure
I'd buy a bottle but the way my bank account's set up
Better watch your words, darg
Catch you slipping, cameras out like Worldstar
Two whips, BM and a Merc, darg
I just fucked your BM in a Merc, darg

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Konan]
I crashed an Astra for banter
I treat whips like Nascar
Now restaurants wanna give me black cards
Cause a brudda blowing up, allahu akbar
When it's time for the nookie
Tell her I don't like when it's bushy
Like the old guy in a hoodie
I fuck her right in the pussy
Ganja in my system
Show me your tits, then
I tell her jump in the Merc
You ain't gotta go west end to see the Big Benz
You know what we came for
Splash cash, then we make more
Money talks, I ain't gotta say more
Tell em I'm active, you know what A's for

[Hook]

[Part 2: "Active" produced by ADP]

[Verse: Skepta]
Yeah, when the sun goes in, that's when I step out, never really see me in the daytime
Step into the club, all these girls wanna do is tell me what they heard on the grapevine
You don't need to know my real name yet bitch, you don't even know me, take time
I told her "If you wanna be my wife, better show me your pussy on Facetime"
I don't link them skets, but I got a couple buff tings that I'd like to smash
Got your girl in my bedroom, all she's wearing is lip gloss and my Nike hat
I told her to forget about the rest
I'mma read you a book that I wrote called how to sex
But before we get started, I'ma read you the alphabet
Like

[Hook: Konan]
You see A, that's for active
Had your bae on my mattress
You see A, that's for active
Had your bae on my mattress

[Refrain]
A's for active, A's for active
A's for active, A's for active
You see A, that's for active
A's for active, A's for active
A's for active (icy)
