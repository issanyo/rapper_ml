[Hook: Jay Sean]
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
I can't take no more of this (girl)
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
Asking if you'll still let me in
Won't you stay, won't you stay?

[Verse 1: Frisco]
Hear what I'm saying, yeah, ask her one more time
If she's stayin' then stay, if she goin' go
Fighting, arguing, hyping, no
That's all long like going go
Forget the knock, knock, knocking
Making a scene all neighbours are clockin'
You need to take control make her know
If she don't open up the door you're bopping
Honestly, if she ain't on it then long it
Make her know who the is boss like [?]
Come like she don't know man's presidential
She must want man to run off like Sonic
The likkle man hyping and fighting is long
Make her know from now that you just ain't on it
Tell her, don't get it wrong, just try get along
If not bounce to your show in Norwich

[Hook: Jay Sean]
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
I can't take no more of this (girl)
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
Asking if you'll still let me in
Won't you stay, won't you stay?

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yo, you need to start acting colder
For no reason, she's giving you the cold shoulder
But when you don't answer the door
She starts investigating' like Scully and Mulder
If she said it's over then it's over
Tell her she's lucky like a four leaf clover
But you keep on ringing her Nokia
Worst thing 'bout it, she's on Voda
Don't call her, don't ring back
Get your car and your diamond ring back
Look how many songs you've sang for the girl
And she can't book studio time and sing back, leave her
Get your old ting back
I don't know why you even started to link that
You need to listen to me Jammer, Chips and Fris
Forget the beef, allow the Big Mac

[Hook: Jay Sean]
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
I can't take no more of this (girl)
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
Asking if you'll still let me in
Won't you stay, won't you stay?

[Verse 3: Chip]
If she's saying she don't wanna stay no more
Creep downstairs lock the door
You can't have it but don't panic
Two days alone she won't manage
Yo, wha gwarn for girls these days
Like say we can't get girls these days
One likkle passa, two likkle problems
Third time 'round you have to beg them to stay, no
You need to 'low it
Remind her who wears the trousers
These women forgetting their roles
Tell her I said know your role and pose
She sees the reaction when you do shows
Females flexing like their brainless
Fam, its' not like your nameless
P.S. do not forget you're famous

[Hook: Jay Sean]
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
I can't take no more of this (girl)
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
Asking if you'll still let me in
Won't you stay, won't you stay?

[Verse 4: Jammer]
Yo
Why do girls always wanna talk about leaving?
She says, she's gone again
And this time she's gone much further than Ealing
Don't watch that she'll be gone by the evening
Don't hold your breath cause you might stop breathing
And if she's part of the plan, then what you achieving
Girls only leave cause they can't take deceiving
After she's got what she wants and she packs up her bags
And opens the door and talks about breezin'
That's why I'm colder at the door, girls wanna war like freezing
Get that cash money, get them G's in
Get you cars dry know what you're dealing
Don't try to propose when you're kneeling
Cause your heart will need a lot more than healing

[Hook: Jay Sean x2]
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
I can't take no more of this (girl)
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
Asking if you'll still let me in
Won't you stay, won't you stay?
