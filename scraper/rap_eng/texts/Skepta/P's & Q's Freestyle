Money with the gang, we get girls with the gang
I eat food with the gang
I talk slang to the feds
Can't work out what I just said to a man
Told me he was a big fan but the first thing he said
When he saw me was "can I get a pic for the 'Gram?"
I was like "nah, sorry man"
"I only socialise with the crew and the gang"
They wanna see me drown
Tryna hold the mandem down
Cause I shutdown Shoreditch car park
And I got bars like Camden Town
Out there tryna survive on the streets
Trying not to get killed by the police
And I'll be schooling MCs
Nobody leaves till half past three
This year, I'mma teach them a lesson
Told Jess don't reply to those emails
Nah, I don't wanna do no sessions
It's like them man have got an obsession
With my style of expression
But in public, never hear my name mentioned
Catch them at the nightclub entrance
Always seeking attention
But I be inside, tryna get burst
Looking all cool like Herc
Dressed like I just came from PE
You're dressed like you've just come from church
Better do your research
You don't wanna hear my verse come after your verse
MCs act brand new
Cause they've got a little money in their purse
So you've had a good solo career?
Had a few big songs over the years?
Back then, you was a real top boy
But right now, fam, nobody cares
Walked in the club, everybody's like "who is he?"
"Why is he walking around with security?"
You know the postcode, when you're talking road
Better know that I speak that fluently
I get money with the gang, I get girls with the gang
I eat food with the gang
I talk slang to the feds
Can't work out what I just said to a man
Told me he was a big fan but the first thing he said
When he saw me was "can I get a pic for the 'Gram?"
I was like "nah, sorry man"
"I only socialise with the crew and the gang"
