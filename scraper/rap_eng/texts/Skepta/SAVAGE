[INTRO XTRA SAUCE]
Hop in the Bentley (skrrt)
Drivin it with me (aye)
Bruce Lee yeah kickin with me (yeah)


[Chorus XTRA SAUCE]
I'm so savage, if I'm called out I call in. Skepta, from London. My GPS say I'm brought in, so fire, a fire truck have to come in. I'm so savage, if I'm called out I call in. Skepta, from London. My GPS say I'm brought in, so fire, a fire truck have to come in
I'm so savage, if I'm called out I call in. Skepta, from London. My GPS say I'm brought in, so fire, a fire truck have to come in



[VERSE 1 XTRA SAUCE]
My milly rock so fresh, when I hit them folks look like I'm gettin cash
Aye
Picking up where I left I won't even have to let go. Why you so cold bro? So cold it's about to snow. If we on a boat then y'all know I row
Aye
Aye
Looks like Xtra Sauce coming out with another song, teamed up with Skepta. Never texted me back like, "What Bruh?"



[Chorus XTRA SAUCE]
I'm so savage, if I'm called out I call in. Skepta, from London. My GPS say I'm brought in, so fire, a fire truck have to come in. I'm so savage, if I'm called out I call in. Skepta, from London. My GPS say I'm brought in, so fire, a fire truck have to come in
I'm so savage, if I'm called out I call in. Skepta, from London. My GPS say I'm brought in, so fire, a fire truck have to come in



[VERSE 2 XTRA SAUCE]
I'm savage, I'm savage, I'm savage, I'm savage, I'm savage, I'm savage, but I'm not 21 (NOPE) I'm savage, I'm savage, I'm savage, I'm savage, I'm savage, I'm savage,  but I'm not 21 (NOPE)



[OUTRO XTRA SAUCE]
Yeah
Ooh Xtra Sauce!
