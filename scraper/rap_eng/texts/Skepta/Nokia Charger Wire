[Intro]
Skepta, Original, African, Zulu Cemetery Warrior
Joseph, Boy Better Know

[Hook]
These MCs, they try to disrespect my empire
So I hit the road, to check a skeng supplier
Give me a skeng that can start a fire
I want a skeng that's long, like my Nokia charger wire
These MCs, they try to disrespect my empire
So I hit the road to check a skeng supplier
Give me a skeng that can start a fire
I want a skeng that's long, like my Nokia charger wire

[Verse 1]
Testing it
Yeah, check one two, testing it
King of grime, yes, I'm the best in it
But some man ain't respecting it
Well, if you don't agree with me then
We can start 50 and Kanye Westin' it
I win any MC contest, innit
I really put eight MC's to rest, innit
Yeah, them man get vexed, innit
Cause I got your girlfriend undressed, innit
She was 34 double D, breasting it
Missionary and doggy style, flexing it
But true say, I was safe sexing it
The boyfriend started sending threats, innit
So I jumped in the passenger seat, one glove
One gun, start bulletproof vestin' it

[Verse 2]
I'm a cemetery warrior, but I'm not yardie
Don't talk to me about karate
More time, you will see me in a party
Drinking a champs, in an Ed Hardy
No guy could ever take my car key, or my bike key
I want a skeng that's big and tall like DJ Big Mikee
So trust me, you don't want me to get ugly
Flowdan is my uncle
If you don't like it, come out the country
Boy Better Know any violations get dealt with abruptly
The last time I drawed my machine out
Tony Blair started phoning my Mumsie
I told Mumsie to hang up
I told 'em already they can't bad badman up
I said sit down, who said stand up?
Stay there, who said come here?
You think I don't know that pussyholes don't like me?
But it's okay 'cause they can't buss gun here
That's why the gun talk goes into one ear
Then it comes out of the other one
Fuck Girl Better Blow and the other one
Boy Better Know, that's the label
Me, Fris, Shorty, Wiley, Sam, Max and my brother run

[Hook]
These MCs, they try to disrespect my empire
