Yeah, It's Tune Of The Month, Is He Dumb, I Don't Care, How Long He Put It Out. I'm Riding It
Yeah, Skepta. Send It Out To Rebound X, Nothing Long
Yo

[Skepta:]
You See The Top Four Crews In The Game I'm In Them
If You Don't Like Me, Do Something Then
Too Many Screwfaces, I Ain't In Them
I Want Paper, Dibby Dibby Wages I Ain't In Them
My Crew Put 5 20 Pound Notes In A Roulette Machine And Spin Them
Anybody Get Rude, I Clench My Fist And Chin Them
Forget A Mash, Forget A Clash
They're Trash, I'll Bin Them
I Don't Wanna Lyrical Swing, I Will Physically Swing Them
That's Why I Haven't Clashed Anybody Since Long, So Then So Win Some
If I Hear Man Say My Name, I'll Ring Them
If I Hear Any Guntalk On My 3310
Find Out Where They Are And Link Them
Headlock, Powerdrive Then Pin Them

[JME:]
I Don't Know Where You Think You're Going With Them One, Two Likkle Bars
Deadout
Clash Me, You'll Get A Par
You Know Ma Face, Jamie Adenuga
I Don't Care What Madderman Thinks
I Heard You're Mixtape And It Stinks
How You Perform When Your Onstage
Smells Exactly Like Your Mixtape
When I Spray, Everyone Gets Haps
Jumping Around, Shouting BRAP BRAP
Doing Bare Tings Wid Their Hands
That's How You Know Mans Got BARE Fans
You Ain't Got Anyone But Cats
About You Got Bedrins And That
Don't Try A Ting, Man Ain't A Ediot
Tell You To Shh Hut Yuh Muh, Derkhead

[Skepta:]
Joseph, But I'm Not You Average Joe Though
I Will Murk Your Whole Team On A Solo
Cause I'm Massive In The Game, You're A Midget In This Game
I'm Like Pizza Hut, You're Like Pizza Go-Go
Me Wife A Hoe, That's A No No
Never Give No Girl Ma Last Rolo
Cause I'm Still Getting Thoughts Of Ma Girl Going Up And Down On Her Ex Man Like A Yo-Yo
But Forget That, I'm Skepta, Take A Photo
Black T-Shirt, Boy Better Know Logo
Man Know, I'm Still In The Bits, So When They See Me They Say "Wagwan, Show Show"
Gun Traffic, But I Don't Go Flow
I Just Come Of Ma 2 Year Ban, I'm Still Bussing Off Illegal Youies In Front Of The Po-Po
Red Light, But I Still Go Though
Go On Then

[JME:]
Jamie And I Get Deep On The Dubz
Vocals Never Sound Weak On The Dubz
Man Said They Wanna Hear Me Dubz On The Dubz
I Can Spit Fast Like D Dubz On The Dubz, D Dubz D D
Like If Your Mum's On The Dubz
Clubs See Cheese, Like Subz On The Dubz
Hear My Voice In A Club On The Dubz
Drop Like A Guy In The Pub On The Dance
Jamie And I Get Deep On The Dubz
Vocals Never Sound Weak On The Dubz
Man Said They Wanna Hear Me Dubz On The Dubz
I Can Spit Fast Like D Dubz On The Dubz, D Dubz D D
Like If Your Mum's On The Dubz
Clubs See Cheese, Like Subz On The Dubz
Hear My Voice In A Club On The Dubz
Drop Like A Guy In The Pub On The Dance

[Skepta:]
I Know You Wrote That Lyric For Me And JME, So Don't Even Bother Explaining It
Your Guntalk, I'm Not Entertaining It
I Show Love But Your Not Embracing It
Stop Talking Like Your Voice Has Bass In It
I've Got The Title And None Of You Are Taking It
You'll Get An Action Replay Lord Of The Mics 2, If You Write A Bar Wid Ma Name In It
I'm The Best, There's No Escaping It
When I'm On The Radio, Man Are Taping It
I'm a Keep Spitting Till I Get A House And A Car Wid A BassBox And A Face In It
You Man Have Been On The Road For Too Long, Stop Spending Your Money, Start Saving
You're Getting Old Now, You Never Used To Have A Beard, Now You're Shaving
Use Your Head, You've Got A Brain

[JME:]
Dickhead, Waisman, Poomplex
Don't Know What You're Thinking, But It's Not Me And You Spitting In The Same Roomflex
When I Enter, You Exit Ca
You Said Shit Bout Me And Skepta
Now Shit Can't Be Perfect Ca
You Let The Situation Get Commmplex
When I'm In The Bitz
You're Diaphragm, Sucks In A Bit
I Bring The Pressure, I Make The Hits
Skepta Made Six MC's Quit
That's Right, Next MC's Can't Test Me
Skepta, H, Bossman And Prez T
You Know I Come With Every
Catch Me In Sidewinder, Eski

[Skepta:]
I Go To Many Different Dances
Some Of Them Are Not Safe, But I Take Chances
I Got Friends In Different Endz
That's Why My Family Tree Has So Many Branches
I'm A Big Artist And I Know My Name's Is On Your Tongue Like Shoelaces
That's You See Me Surfing The Net, Looking At These Fake Gangsters MySpace's
I'm On This Ting, Remember Their Faces
Look At Their Top Friends, Clock Their Faces
The Way These Black Man Hate Me, Cause I'm A Black MC, You Would Thought They Were Racist
I Don't Talk Greeze On A Regular Basis
But I Used To Roll With The Ball And The Cue Like Steve Davis
And You Won't Ever Hear Me Boasting About Any Likkle Babylon Chases

[JME:]
Or Any Rave, When I Come Around
Everybody Knows, What's Going Down
I'm On This Ting, Look At Ma Face
DON'T GET RUDE! Know Your Place
Drink Your Drink Or Just Blaze Your Zoot
Pretend You're On The Phone If You Need To
Can't Jack Me, Can't Rob Me, Can't Screw
Cause I'm A Badboy Just Like You
I Don't Think He Heard What I Said
This MC Ain't Heard What I Said
Skepta, He Ain't Hear What I Said
If He Can't Hear, He'll Feel Instead
I Don't Think He Heard What I Said
This MC Ain't Heard What I Said
Skepta, He Ain't Hear What I Said
If He Can't Hear, He'll Feel Instead
