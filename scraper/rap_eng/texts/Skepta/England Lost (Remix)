[Intro: Mick Jagger]
Lost, lost, lost, lost

[Chorus: Mick Jagger]
I went to see England, but England's lost
I went to see England, but England's lost

[Verse 1: Mick Jagger]
And everyone said we were all ripped off
I went to see England, but England lost
Lost, lost, lost
It wasn't much fun standin' in the rain
And we all yelled loud and we all complained
Wasn't much of a game
I got soaked
Didn't look home anyway

[Chorus: Mick Jagger]
I went to see England, but England's lost
I went in the back, but they said, "Piss off"
I went to see England, but England's lost
I went to see England, but England...
I went to see...
I went...
I...

[Verse 2: Mick Jagger]
I lost a blunt, think I lost the pint
She can go home and smoke a joint, anyway
Do you wanna go?
I went to find England, it wasn't there
I went to find England, it wasn't there
I think I lost it in the back of my chair
I think I'm losing my imagination
I'm tired of talking about immigration
You can't get in and you can't get out
I guess that's what we're all about

[Verse 3: Skepta]
True, preach
It's a déjà vu, I've seen it all before
Different season, same score
Everybody wants your head on a spike
But they were singin' your praises a day before
No new faces allowed in
They said it's gettin' overcrowded
They're still fightin' over houses
So I just pick it up, put it down and leave it where I found it
Feel like Macaulay Culkin, I'm home alone
Come to my window and throw a stone
Because I never wanna talk on the phone
Same problems, growin' up in the danger zone
Nothing's changed, same story
Same dirty stains on your dirty laundry
Keep it in the streets, doin' all the work
And the men in the suits takin' all the coin

[Chorus: Mick Jagger]
I went to find England, but...
I went to find England, but...
I went to find England, but...
I went to find England, but England's lost

[Bridge: Mick Jagger]
Lost, lost, lost, lost
Lost, lost, lost, lost

[Verse 4: Mick Jagger]
Had a girl in Lisbon, a girl in Rome
Now I'll have to stay at home
So lock the shallows, bolt the doors
Nothing's gonna be like Singapore
Don't know what's home
Lost, lost, lost, lost
They didn't turn up, the comments complain
No real person is matching their shame
They're much too young and much too hold
Growing much too hot and much too cold
That's what I thought

[Chorus: Mick Jagger]
I went to find England
I went to find England
I went to find England
I went to find England, but England's lost
