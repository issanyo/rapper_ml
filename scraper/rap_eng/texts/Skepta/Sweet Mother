[Hook X4]
Sweet mother I no go forget you
For the suffer wey you suffer for me

[Verse 1]
Mom, mom, mom you know you're my number one
Mom you know you're my number one
And I know actions speak louder than words too but I'm telling you now I love you mom
I love you mom
For all the big things and all the little little stuff you've done
And I know actions speak loud, but they can't speak louder than the crowd
When I say you will get an action replay and a rollin' with the nines if you get rude to my mumsie
I'm a nice guy but I can get ugly
I'm a grime guy bit I can get funky
And me without mom is like cornflakes without the milk
I love my mom like garnet silk
But I don't wanna get locked up like shine
So God forgive me If I bust my (nine)

[Hook X2]
Sweet mother I no go forget you
For the suffer wey you suffer for me

[Verse 2]
Listen to this mum
This songs worth much more than a kiss mum
Worth more than a bracelet on the wrist mum
And you know me dad, I'm your first son
And I will never let nobody diss mum
I don't know another love like this mum
How can your love make me happy as Larry
But still sometimes make cry like ...? mum
Mom Better Know that I will always take care of two younger brothers and my sis mum
I know we argue, but it's all crisp mum
Me and JME are like ace and vis mum
It's okay leave that sit down
You just made it through let me wash up the dish mum
You deserve it, you gave birth to two of the biggest grime artist in the bizz mum

[Hook X2]
Sweet mother I no go forget you
For the suffer wey you suffer for me

[Verse 3]
I love you mom, it's the deepest love
The deepest feeling
And if you love your mum
Let me see your middle finger and index finger touching the ceiling
And say 'BRRAP' 'BRRAP'
Cause if it wasn't for your mum you wouldn't be breathing
And I know I don't normally MC like this
But you know what it's not a MC ting
I'm not a ...? son
That's not me don
I love my sweet mum
She brought me up properly
She never let me come home at all hours of the evening
Cause when I was bad, she made me stand in the corner
And put my hands up
It was either that or get a beating

[Hook X2]
Sweet mother I no go forget you
For the suffer wey you suffer for me

[Outro]
I love you mum
It's not just mother day
Not just on your birthday, everyday
I love you, this one's for you
Actually mum, can I borrow phone cah
Let me phone up nan and grandad and let them know that two of their grandsons are in the big money sound
Cuz grandma and grandad...better know
