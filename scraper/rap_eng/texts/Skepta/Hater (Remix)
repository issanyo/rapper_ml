Whoa Kenny

[Verse 1: KEY!]
Jaw locked up like I'm sixth floor locked up (Yeah)
Rocky do the Raf, hey, I'm twin Glocked up
In my bitches' bags, huh, they hold felonies
Y'all ain't get no money, hah, that's what you tellin' me
Man, I hopped up out this Earth and turned into a star (Okay)
Baby girl, forgot you like I ate a Xanax bar (Okay)
Niggas groupie too, they wanna hang for no reason (Whoa)
Nigga, you ain't my day one (Ayy)
Spent your advance on Saint Laurent (Whoa)
I get high then tend to my motherfuckin' responsibilities (You dig?)
I'm an ape, babe, hah
No this ain't Bape, babe (You dig?)
Let it rip like Beyblade (You dig?)
Give me tongue and neck, babe (Whoa)

Saw you in the flesh, poor excuse for a man
