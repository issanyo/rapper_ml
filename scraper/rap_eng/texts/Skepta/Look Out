[Intro]
Yeah, done know...Giggs, Skeps
Browse it, Boom Productions
SN1, Boy Better Know
Ahhhh, look out you bastards...haha

[Verse 1: Giggs]
SN1 on my tee again, my black trousers D&G again
Looking like a G again
That's right it's me again
My big .45's gotta flea in 'em
Think I've only got one Mac, got three of em
Then you won't see me again
Time to get the white in and the B again
Just got some high grades from Vesra
I'm a real G so I gotta little extra
I like hot girls cause I'm extra
Thought about my lighty then I text her
Impressed her, thinks I'm on shit cause I'm doing it with Skepta
Take off your whole head top, Hannibal Lecter
Black director, shoot up shit then I cut in the Vectra
Orange bud weed lookin nectar
Strap a big boy spliff sotum nester
Had to breeze up to Chester
Got a new flake link, gotta tester
Ooohh...potent white girl, so I pressed her
Hugh Hefner, pitch niggers like Scarface did Hector
Breeze in there like car chase with feds cah it's looking like them Jakes wanna get us
I'm the best cause I ain't in the rap game were the best bruv
We got the best slugs, so come against us

[Hook: Giggs x2]
This is the hard shit
Makes you wanna lick out a cartridge
Look out you bastards
We push out the hard shit

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Now this might sound a bit cheeky but I don't even try fam I make it look easy, naturally greazy
Me and Giggs run up and take all the gold coins like Mario and Luigi
You wanna say something, say it when you see me
Don't phone me, save your credit
Cause if you can't tell me what happens after you die I don't wanna hear it
You ain't half a gangster, nowhere near it
Meridian, that's my murdering force
Giggs beat the skeng in South, I heard it in North
And hate me; Boy Better Know t-shirts and SN1 wear for the whole world to endorse, course
North's up in this bitch
I don't know what you heard but you can't take the piss
If you saw what the kick back done to my wrist
You would have never put my name on your murder list
Fam if you interrupt the vibe that I'm in then I ride ride ride with my ting
So fuck them niggers, everyday I'm surrounded by killers, like I was on a lifers wing
See I'm a cool brudda with a heart of the wickedest
Violate me I squeeze this 'til it finishes
Then I switch clips like Hollowman switches chicks
Rinse the machine like boom bye bye, I call that Buju Banton
Light up your head like a lantern
Boy Better Know standard
"Look Out", that's the anthem
Ask all the mandem, out here in the grime scene I'm a champion
Until I get a mansion, I'mma keep murdering spitters at random

[Hook: Giggs x2]

[Outro: Giggs]
Haha, what they gonna say now?
How can you have a hit yet?
2 BET nominees on one track
We can write at home, but we wanna write in the studio and make it look good
SN1, Boy Better Know, done know
