[Chorus: Skepta]
We were chillin'
Then we had sex
In the kitchen
In the shower
In my bed
On the couch
In other words we had sex all over the house
All over the house
All over the house
In other words we had sex all over the house
All over the house
All over the house (Wow)
In other words we had sex all over the house (Skepta)

[Verse 1: Skepta]
She came closer
I popped up like bread in a toaster
Alright, alright, foreplay's over
I stuck her up on the wall like a poster
Then I told her
Let me show you something you won't forget
Just hold me around my neck
And let me pick you up by the legs
She said, "Junior, don't drop me"
I said, "Baby I do this properly
Just kiss me
Close your eyes, hold on tight, now the rest is history"
Now I got princess open, like a birthday card
The way I'm gonna show her around the house, you would've thought I was tryna sell her the yard, smooth

[Chorus: Skepta & Majestic]
We were chillin'
Then we had sex
In the kitchen
In the shower
In my bed
On the couch
In other words we had sex all over the house
All over the house
All over the house (Yeah)
In other words we had sex all over the house (The bedroom)
All over the house (The shower)
All over the house (I ain't got no time for the bedroom)
In other words we had sex all over the house

[Verse 2: Majestic]
She's giving me 'come to bed' eyes
I need to, come correct, why?
She loves my, XL size
I wanna be, between those thighs
All over the house
Front room she opened the blouse
Had a body like wow
No time for the bedroom I had to act now
And I was like, "Hey pretty missy
The way you're looking is oh so pretty
To lose this moment would be a pity"
But this ain't sex ain't city
This is sex in the kitchen
This is sex on the floor
Animalistic, going on all fours
Working the house but this ain't a chore, smooth

[Chorus: Skepta & Shorty]
We were chillin'
Then we had sex
In the kitchen
In the shower
In my bed
On the couch
In other words we had sex all over the house
All over the house
All over the house
In other words we had sex all over the house (All over the house)
All over the house (All over the house)
All over the house
In other words we had sex all over the house

[Verse 3: Shorty]
She hadn't seen me in ages
I came in gave her a kiss on the lips, took off my rucksack and my trainers
Let me flick forward a couple pages
Then it all started
1 word, outrageous
In and out like CD changes
Our bodies exchanging flavours
I put her on a table
Moved all the papers
Her legs high up in the air
Non stop like bassline ravers
Then we went to the bedroom
On the floor, move the straighteners
The way we were all over the house
You would've thought we were painters, smooth

[Chorus: Skepta]
We were chillin'
Then we had sex
In the kitchen
In the shower
In my bed
On the couch
In other words we had sex all over the house
All over the house
All over the house
In other words we had sex all over the house
All over the house
All over the house
In other words we had sex all over the house

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 2: Skepta]
In other words we had sex all over the house
All over the house
All over the house
In other words we had sex all over the house
All over the house
All over the house
In other words we had sex all over the house
All over the house
All over the house
In other words we had sex all over the house
All over the house
All over the house
In other words we had sex all over the house
