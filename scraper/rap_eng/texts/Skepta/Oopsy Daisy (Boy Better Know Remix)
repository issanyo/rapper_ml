[Verse 1: Skepta]
Yo, I'm leaving, you ain't gotta tell me twice
I'm gone, I'm nice
This weren't gonna work anyway
With your wasted chicken and your wasted rice
Trust me, it's all gone Pete Tong
I don't wanna try no more, it's long
And I told you already on the Jay Sean song
As soon as you tell me to go, then I'm gone
Alright then?
It's gonna be a mad ting
I don't think you realise what's happening
You're gonna cry so send for the napkin
I don't wanna see you again
More fish in the sea, I'm a G to the N
And whoever taught you how to cook chicken and rice
Tell them teach you again

[Hook: Ms D]
Oopsy daisy, I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out, baby, I'll understand
Cause all I'll do is hurt you again
Oopsy daisy, I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out, baby, I'll understand
Cause all I'll do is hurt you again

[Verse 2: Jme]
You always cry over spilt milk
Even when you're spilling it
What relatinship? You're killing it
Oopsy daisy, idiot
Ask me to leave one more time, go on
Cause you know I will, init?
There's gonna be a cold space
In the bed next to you, no one's filling it
See, we all make mistakes
But now, who's gonna take my place?
Out of a million durag-wearing guys
You can't mistake my face
If it still ain't sunk in, then
I'm gonna have to keep saying it
Listen, you've made your bed
So now, you've gotta lay in it

[Bridge: Ms D]
I'm a walking disaster
Don't wanna hurt you, that's why you got to go
Destruction like fire, all around you
That's why you got to go, oh

[Verse 3: Chip]
(Yeah, Chipmunk, let me go)
Yeah, it's remix, murder, hun
I'm a remix murderer
I see you're on a leaving tip
Maybe it's because I blew up too quick
But you can't get used to the fame (why not?)
Too many girls calling my name (I know)
You see the effects of the chain? (ice)
It's all just part of the game
Bun it, I'm going harder it
Without me, it's walking disaster
About Jimmy Choo, Jimmy who?
PS, no more Prada
You can't hurt the unhurtable
Unemployed, it can't work at all
Therefore, it's over
Honey, Chip's off your shoulder

[Hook: Ms D]
Oopsy daisy, I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out, baby, I'll understand
Cause all I'll do is hurt you again
Oopsy daisy, I hurt you again
Crushed your heart in the palm of my hands
If you walk out, baby, I'll understand
Cause all I'll do is hurt you again
