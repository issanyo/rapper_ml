[Hook: Frisco]
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord, I'm a
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord
It's the remix so you know that
I had to call for a couple of the other grime lords

[Verse 1: Frisco]
And I'm back like a spine cord
The remix, I'm a grime lord
Dem man are cyborg, me, I'm everywhere
Might see me in Amsterdam, not Feyenoord
Simple, I don't take bad up
Name an MC that tried it and didn't get had up
Them man are moving digital
You're a crumb, you can still get bagged up
Hands up when I come through, nigga, stand up
I'm a G to the R-I-M-E
Hello, are these MCs? Ain't ready
So mind how you address me
Cuh the man dem around me don't take kindly
To man acting like the He-Man
Out to my dogs in the can [?]
Ain't none of them geez can see man

[Hook: Frisco]
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord, I'm a
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord
It's the remix so you know that
I had to call for a couple of the other grime lords

[Verse 2: Skepta]
You can find me right here sitting in my chair
With a big bag of herbs and a tea
Looking at all these fake versions of me
Keeping it G, representing the three words on my tee
Grime, I'm made for that
Say what I mean so I don't take it back
And if you think you're an OG cause you're making a little P
I'll make an MC fade to black
Lyrically I don't fear these clowns
And if you wanna get physical, I'll kick a man to the ground
You ain't done jack shit for grime
You're just standing around
Clutching at straws, twiddling thumbs
So when you get the mic, rudeboy, just hurry up
Spit your shit lyric and done
Praise the lord like the vicar and nun

[Hook: Frisco]
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord, I'm a
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord
It's the remix so you know that
I had to call for a couple of the other grime lords

[Verse 3: Lethal Bizzle]
Man are grime lord, you're a grime Ford, man are ninja
Blacked out with the five-door, had an R6
Man are putting out vinyl 10 years in
Still moving like rhinos, raging bulls
You manamanaman are arseholes
You ain't no Frisco, Bizzle or Rascals
Or no Wileys, manaman respected highly
Kings of the ting, don't try me
Manaman are hungry, starving, manaman are hungry, Marvin
You man are jarring
Talking about no Ps in grime
When it bought me a 500 house and a great big garden
Boy Better Know [?] run the scene
Leave it if you ain't cool with the team
Dench, couple man try intervene
But 2 2, you man are parring the scene

[Hook: Frisco]
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord, I'm a
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord
It's the remix so you know that
I had to call for a couple of the other grime lords

[Verse 4: Ghetts]
I've been relevant so many years
I can now see I ain't gonna die, I'm immortal
Not one lyric of mine defines normal
Whenever I finish a line, I'm like ooh
Also that my rhyming is awesome
Man could never tell me about 140BPM
Grime's in my organs
Even when I'm tired of recording
I've got a late night every night
Still gonna get up when it's 5 in the morning
I be the grime lord
G's been about so long
Man are calling the title extortion
I ain't gotta ride in the morning
My flow's so quick
My only rival'll be the guy in the auction
I'm from the grime scene, nobody ever cared for us
Survivor of the orphans

[Hook: Frisco]
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord, I'm a
I'm a grime lord, I'm a grime lord
As I told you before, I'm a, I'm a grime lord
It's the remix so you know that
I had to call for a couple of the other grime lords
