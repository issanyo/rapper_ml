Blade in the grass like rambo
Orange socks know that you can get tangoed
New girls got a new tan colour mango
You ain't ever trapped in a bando
Or got a comb for your afro
Work like a slave got my own chain like jango
My haters are lower then ankles more handcuff on my hands like bangles
Restriced so they can't see from dese angles
When you got a soul that deeper then anvils
Know how many hoes that ran thru your in love your a dam fool
Mandem battred your damsel
Attiude i got handful flows on lock like a strangle
Conclusion dying to jump like tadpoles
Know i dont play with little girls like ragdolls
Master mind bars that are flyer than flagpoles


London uk my nation
Nothing but pirate radio
Growing uo they was hating on nathan
Just made my made gear solid like raiden
Biggest artist in my ends ok then
I wasn't chosen i got to the doors and they close them all of there blueprint stolen
Spat so hard till my tonsalls swollen didn't sleep till my eyes didn't open
Gota get my team inside like a trojan
Couple weed bags for the mandem to took
Scars cover my body like a token
Niggas know my name and my conpany slogan
Felling presidental every time that i flow on
Friday turn up hotter than a oven


Animals talk and im speaking in falcon
Wonder how i move in this motion
The saga countines live of a block thats colder than igloos
Surive in the winter like penguins
Know i dont play with that dough like pingo
I know you know wolf won't run out of bars
Cause i got wraps like hindus
Haile rated so she knows what im in2
I won't stop spinning jay amo and big zuu
Got a couple reloads and you got a new for your self thats lovely
Bush main roads with my dons and we hungry
Out here still selling bits on gumtree
I wasn't on the line up i wasn't in the country
2 2 bars thats a ki kat chunky
Hope that bar gave big zuu the munches
Put man thru a table like dudely
Oh happy days im cooler than fonzie


Push my bottoms


Grew my hair our like ken did outskool afro wild like hendricks
No media werewolf's in the west coast like kendricks
Respect it
Respect it or not i ain't ever goner beg for your friendship
Your team get taken for mugs like lemsip
Stand my ground and my shoes are expensive
No media my histroy in grime is extensive
She feels me cause i can turn on her senses
Know that you feel me deep down like appendix
My run down the track is electric
Wanna judge my appearance i am eccentric
16 bars in the clip are extend it
In studio hear a beat and select it
