Verse 1 (Jammer)

You better know what's crackin'
When I touch the mic it's a straight up Jack 'em
Straight up, pull up, as soon as i pull up, jump out the whip cameras start flashin'
So many girls keep [?]
Fam keep snappin' until their cameras are full up
Boy better know if boy better know's in bill better know that your dance is full up
Paper, [?]

But i just want what my niggas say that i'm takin' back

I'll make your mum dance and my name is Jack

(Chorus)
When we get to the dances mayhem
I got so much bars i can't wait to get on the stage and spray dem

Verse 3 (Skepta)
No pen, no paper

Boy Better Know listen

When i come through it's a madness
I got a VIP band on my wrist
The mandem want me to sign their creps
The gyal-dem want me to sign their tits
Everybody's asking me where's Merkel
Everybody asking me where's Fris
Anytime them two are together you've got to let them park the whip and finish the spliff
Me and my mandem are always tourin'
Again with 25 man let 'em all in
Security, let 'em all in
Grab the mic then Frisco said
'i come through like what is it on'
The crowd said the rest of the bar for him
So when i'm at the bar makin' it rain
I'm makin' it back that's what ypou call ballin'

(Chorus)
When we get to the dances mayhem
I got so much bars i can't wait to get on the stage and spray dem
Anytime that you see me Skeppy and Jammer
Just know that you're looking at made men
We can do this anytime, anyplace it's up to you just say when [x4]
