[Chorus]
They try to disrespect me
When they're online especially
But everyting cool when they check me
Because I'm so cool and deadly
See, I had to realise slowly
That nobody actually knows me
Yeah, man, I've got fifteen different iPhones
But I am so not phoney
They try to disrespect me
When they're online especially
But everyting cool when they check me
Because I'm so cool and deadly
See, I had to realise slowly
That nobody actually knows me
Yeah, man, I've got fifteen different iPhones
But I am so not phoney

[Verse 1]
See them online, they're vexing
They see the shirt I'm flexing
They see my spliff get larger
They see the girl I'm sexing
I'm a Nigerian eagle
In London smoking illegal
Nah, we are so not equal
Them man are cloning people
Anything I do, they bite
How do you sleep at night?
Is it codeine and Sprite?
I switch up the steez on guys
I stand up in the rain, I'm dancing
Then I look at the game, start laughing
It's not a joke, though, got the fakes in a chokehold
I'd love to see them gasping

[Chorus]
'Cause they try to disrespect me
When they're online especially
But everyting cool when they check me
Because I'm so cool and deadly
See, I had to realise slowly
That nobody actually knows me
Yeah, man, I've got fifteen different iPhones
But I am so not phoney

[Bridge]
Everyday I'm shitting and I'm pissing on this hypocrisy
Everyday I'm shitting and I'm pissing on this hypocrisy
Everyday I'm shitting and I'm pissing on this hypocrisy
It's that uncontrollable demon they didn't wanna see
Greaze!

[Verse 2]
I declined some amazing dinners
And I'm still blazing Rizlas
I wanted to make some changes
I was not taking pictures
Now look at the labels dying
Nobody else is signing
We know the truth they're hiding
See, the plaques on my wall just shining
And I've already seen my death
We were the last ones left
I saw the whole hood get gassed
I had to hold my breath
I was a young black yout
The teacher took my zoots
They tried to show man Roots
They tried to send man loops
Now you have to respect it
I've been around the world, I'm tried and tested
Getting back money that I invested
Don't know about me? Get connected
No, I don't do that conscious rap, but
Man still know about Wretch and Kendrick
Top five niggas, don't get offended
Murdered the beat, no, it ain't attempted
I meant it
And I'm still top three selected
They never showed me the guest list
Nah, we just walked in the exit
Just came back from the Ivors
And look at what we collected
The MBE got rejected
I'm not tryna be accepted

[Chorus]
They try to disrespect me
When they're online especially
But everyting cool when they check me
Because I'm so cool and deadly
See, I had to realise slowly
That nobody actually knows me
Yeah, man, I've got fifteen different iPhones
But I am so not phoney
They try to disrespect me
When they're online especially
But everyting cool when they check me
Because I'm so cool and deadly
See, I had to realise slowly
That nobody actually knows me
Yeah, man, I've got fifteen different iPhones
But I am so not phoney

[Bridge]
Everyday I'm shitting and I'm pissing on this hypocrisy
Everyday I'm shitting and I'm pissing on this hypocrisy
Everyday I'm shitting and I'm pissing on this hypocrisy
It's that uncontrollable demon they didn't wanna see
Greaze!
