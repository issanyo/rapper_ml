[Hook: Toro Y Moi]
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
If you ain't up on my level, disappear, please don't reply, bye

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Most of the time I'm calm
But right now I got a devil in my palm
I know I said that I wear sunglasses at night
But tonight I need to see where I'm goin'
Wanna see somebody drop to the ground
No civilians, no doctors around
Who said life is priceless?
So far your life cost me a pound
One phone call and a 10p text
All of my man, dem link up quick
We don't care what ends he reps
When I said it, should've known it wasn't any old rhyme
Got a couple killers that are never online
Might seen a shadow in a video of mine
Standin' behind the camera with the director
Ready to shoot an MC one time

[Hook: Toro Y Moi]
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
If you ain't up on my level, disappear, please don't reply, bye

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Somebody's gonna get murked
Spoke to my mum 'bout that there work
Counted to 10 but that didn't work
Fuck this shit, man I'm puttin' in work
Switch them plates, man I'm goin' on a ride
Black Bally on and I look like a fly
Give mumsy a kiss, tell her you'll be home soon
Come to the gate when I pull up on the drive
I don't care if it's rainin' or not
We get chased by feds
Everybody in the car better know that I'm failin' to stop
Cause like Luis Suarez, these police love takin' a shot
Bitin' enemy violatin' the squad
So fuck my albums, fuck all my mixtapes in the shop
Real Gs don't procrastinate on the job

[Hook: Toro Y Moi]
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
I be flying high, shawty, I be flying high
If you ain't up on my level, disappear, please don't reply, bye

[Outro: Skepta]
Danger, tell these babies there's no space in the manger
Anybody get rude, I'll send for the head top, rearrange yah
