[Bridge - Skepta]
Out on the streets in the 90's
Never had enough money for an ice cream
Niggas on the other side wanna fight me
All the chicks in the hood wanna wife me
Black chicks, white chicks and the lighties
On the stairs in the flats getting grimey
See a nigga in my hood looking icy
Quick jack move, now the feds wanna find me

[Verse 1: Megaman]
Ho, yeah, yo Skep, dee give me another R
They never see it coming, they're having a laugh
And now our team's got more niggas with more class
So we need to keep the scene on par
So listen when we say we're in a bit of demand
Been here living already, we don't need to get a pass
We don't talk the dream, we take part
How ya mean, how ya mean, we're taking it too far

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah, Mega, we're taking it too far
Forget a sixteen, I kill it in two bars
Forget all the money, forget all the new cars
You put that all aside and you're looking at two stars
Oh shit, I pull out my camera
Tell man "hold this", two middle fingers up to the feds
Tell him that it's Dwayne and Joseph
You're fucking with underdog psychosis, ey!

[Hook: Megaman & Misha B]
Ah, if you wanna go deeper than this
Nah, they ain't getting no deeper than this
Got North, East, West and South eating
Boy Better Know and So Solid: we begin things
We begin things, we begin things
We begin things, we begin things
Ah, if you wanna go deeper than this
Nah, they ain't getting no deeper than this
Got North, East, West and South eating
Boy Better Know and So Solid: we begin things
We begin things, we begin things
We begin things, we begin things

[Verse 2: Megaman]
True, say the label, that's madness
Yeah Skeppy, they wanna draw for the madness
I'mma free, how can they say that I'm still on the gangland ting
Surrounded by young G's that bang them thing
I'm a cool breeze, I'm relaxing
Surrounded by who's into big banking
Yeah, I was thug spitting then all packed in
Then recovered the third year like "oh that's him"
"Oh that's him, oh that's him
He's the new in thing, oh that's a win"
We came for the pound, my boys are all in
And the girls wanna shout like "we's a ballin'"
I know you're pretty though
But if I can't figure you out please [?] you gotta go
Oi, over there
Please, I'm skanking with all my G's

[Verse 3: Skepta]
I pull up in the all black tee
My niggas and pretty women is all I see
In the club we celebrating, pop champagne
So I told her to step steady, the floor might be
A little slippery, but we never came here to model
So tell the waiter to bring ten more bottles
I drink that, jump in the car
Put the pedal to the metal, full throttle like woah
Love for my G's on the road like woah
N17 post code like woah
See me on the telly and the video like woah
I keep telling them that I'm gonna blow like woah
Don't understand why they wanna hate on a G
Man I've been killing it since double 0 three
Now they wanna be in the same position as me
And I'm like
