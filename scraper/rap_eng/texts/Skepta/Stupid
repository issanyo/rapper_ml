[Intro: Jammer & Skepta]
Yo, oi, oi (Oi)
Yo, yo, oi soundboy (Nah who, who is it?)
Are you stupid? (Who, oi)
Are you dumb? (Oi, soundboy)
Last soundboy that got stupid, left in a body-bag, stupid (Nah, nah, who is it)

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?
It's not you, it's me
Can't diss a man in my family tree
You'll get shanked in the chest with my front door key
Boxed in the face with my back door key
Draw for the leng, kill a MC
I've got a black ski-mask but I don't ski
And if you diss Wiley or Jme
I will come to your set like - "What soundboy? Who is it? Who is it?"
Everybody gets sprayed
I'm a hit-man but I don't get paid
Two bullets in a wastemans' skin-fade
Leave red stains on his clothes like cherryade
Brand new duppies have to get made
Make your head-top explode like grenade
If you wanna draw for the blade, I'll be like - "What soundboy? Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?"

[Hook: Wiley & Skepta]
Oi, stupid
You don't want to come here and get stupid
The last soundboy that tried to get stupid, left in a body-bag, stupid
That's what he got for being stupid
Oi, stupid
You don't want to come here and get stupid
The last soundboy that tried to get stupid, left in a body-bag, stupid
That's what he got for being stupid

[Verse 2: Wiley]
MCs don't like it when I do war
They want to be famous, no more war
I'm already famous so I do war
I do a road-tour promoting my war
If you don't like war, don't listen to the war
Don't get involved in the bumbaclart war
MCs travel the road and keep quiet
When the come across me they think that they're raw
I'm raw, you can't see me anymore
Everyday I live, I stay low to the floor
Before, you wanna test my crew, you better be sure
Ready for us to blow up your sector
Them boy ain't ready for the war, we draw the chainsaw, in a lyrical war
I bet you never knew I had the keys to the door
Some wife will get blazed with a 4x4

[Hook: Wiley & Skepta]
Oi, stupid
You don't want to come here and get stupid
The last soundboy that tried to get stupid, left in a body-bag, stupid
That's what he got for being stupid
Oi, stupid
You don't want to come here and get stupid
The last soundboy that tried to get stupid, left in a body-bag, stupid
That's what he got for being stupid

[Verse 3: Skepta & Wiley]
They couldn't test me or Wiley
Never been air on the roads, man are rated highly
Draw for the shank give an MC a smiley
You know me - it's D.T.I style
The Eskiboy's bassline used to be glidey
Now he's got a new style-y, it's tidy
My name's Junior, his name's Kylea
We make the big mic-men look tiny (Eskiboy)
You can't test me or Skepta
Come to your ends like Achilles and take out Hector
Do you even know the meaning of war?
Try clash me you get carried out on a stretcher
I wear Nike, don't wear Acupunctures or Sketchers
I'm known for blowing up sectors
I went college but I didn't turn up to no lectures
I'll still make it I bet ya

[Hook: Wiley & Skepta]
Oi, stupid
You don't want to come here and get stupid
The last soundboy that tried to get stupid, left in a body-bag, stupid
That's what he got for being stupid
Oi, stupid
You don't want to come here and get stupid
The last soundboy that tried to get stupid, left in a body-bag, stupid
That's what he got for being stupid
