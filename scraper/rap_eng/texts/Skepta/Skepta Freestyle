I feel sorry for Skepta
That guy never used to sound like Skepta
Now that guy sounds like Skepta so much
He would've though that guy was Skepta

[Verse 1]
I got my own flow I don't wanna swap
Thanks for the offer but cool I'm fine
You can't fink of a new flow
So you play my CD looking to mirror at mine
You run around talking like you invented the flow
But you know that it's mine
Inposession of my flow with intend to supply
Is a treacherous crime
But I don't wanna talk to police
I'm not a snitch, I don't wanna press charges
Imma pop 10 viagra pills and show these pussios
That I'm the hardest
Show these copycat MC's
Why their CD's ain't selling in the market
Put my old flow under the carpet
Went back to the drawing board then I came around
With a flow that i broke down
More times than a P Reg Vauxhall Tigra
Now you can show me a grime beat
Show me a rap beat, nigga I'll feature
Imma jump on the track
And I can bring more vibes than a kid to a teacher
Not turn a creature like Chipmunk in a league of my own
24/7 I'm putting in work while them man are sitting at home
Spit into my mouth gets dry and my lipstick together
Like Kreps and Kon
Yeah, I got my own flow
Don't wanna swap, don't wanna lend, don't wanna loan
Skepta I'm in my own zone
