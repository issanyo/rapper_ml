[Verse 7: Bear Man]
Let's go! Yeah man, I'm Bear Man
Who's saying that I can't take bare man?!
Tell me have you see the size of my bare hands?
It's a 20 centimetre span
Let's go! Yeah man, I'm Bear Man
Who's saying that I can't take bare man?!
Tell me have you see the size of my bare hands?

[Verse 8: Trim]
Yeah it's Trim
Never wanna trim, never gonna trim, never on a trim
And I've always got a trim or canerow
And some chicks like bros with no afro but I keep it real like feds in plain clothes, hate those
Any boy test, get froze in a positional pose I ain't jokin' G
Try trim
I’m proud of my trim and my origin if you hit you won’t win
