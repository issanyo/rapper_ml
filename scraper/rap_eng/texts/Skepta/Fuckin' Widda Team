[Intro]
Shut ya mout'
Joseph Junior Adenuga
'Old tight Kane
Skepta on the microphone
Oi Dan Stacey holla at me I know you can see me
Yo

[Verse 1]
I used to put thirteen scores in my mouth and start choppin' up a next ounce with H
Can't chat to Meridian about weight
You man wouldn't even know what to do with an eighth
You bought an eight ball on the 24th and you're still tryna move it on the 8th
Them boys don't know about Tanitas with the batteries held in with sellotape
You would've thought you was looking at a date of birth when I put my food on the scales
When I get shift I start biting my nails
Never ever been an informer never told tales
I roll with four black males
Feds better lock us in separate jails
Dizzee Rascal should've phoned my phone 'cause we regulate all the class A sales

[Hook]
It's Skepta
You might see me in a Vectra, rollin' with some deep MC's
So it don't make sense you
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)
I will spray any man in a clash and spray any man with a mash
So it don't make sense you
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)
But God forgive me if I bust my Nine
I don't wanna get locked up like Shyne
But that's what you get when you're
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)
I said God forgive me if I bust my Nine
I don't wanna get locked up like Shyne
But that's what you get when you're
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)

[Verse 2]
Right about now Bossman's in jail, so I'm gonna speak on Merrick's behalf
Murder charge ain't a joke and laugh
You think that you're shower but you can't even jump in the bath
I know the skengman that do obia, voodoo and witchcraft
Roll with the nine month old baby so they can pull out the mash from the Winnie the Pooh scarf
Anytime you see me wearing a glove, Boy Better Know I got the gun in my boxers
I don't wanna send an MC to the doctors
I just wanna win a MOBO then go for the Oscars
There's only one Skepta so I gotta lick down any imposters
Lick off ya head like Guiness and Fosters
Can't take wicked man for Pocahontas

[Hook]
It's Skepta
You might see me in a Vectra, rollin' with some deep MC's
So it don't make sense you
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)
I will spray any man in a clash and spray any man with a mash
So it don't make sense you
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)
But God forgive me if I bust my Nine
I don't wanna get locked up like Shyne
But that's what you get when you're
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)
I said God forgive me if I bust my Nine
I don't wanna get locked up like Shyne
But that's what you get when you're
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)

[Verse 3]
Oi Skepta, 'why you murking so many MC's?', that's the word on the road
I know skengman in my postcode that'll sniff two lines and go into devilish mode
Shoot you in the face then skid around the corner, like Yoshi and Toad
So for your own good, trust me, you don't wanna see man on your road
You don't wanna see me on the scene
Last thing you hear is a bang and a scream
Bare mashman want me on their team
Cos they know from I lick shots heads are coming off clean
I'll put a bullet in your bean
Bullet in your canerow, bullet in your lean
Put on the safety and switch off the beam
Wipe your blood off my techno marine

[Hook]
It's Skepta
You might see me in a Vectra, rollin' with some deep MC's
So it don't make sense you
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)
I will spray any man in a clash and spray any man with a mash
So it don't make sense you
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)
But God forgive me if I bust my Nine
I don't wanna get locked up like Shyne
But that's what you get when you're
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)
I said God forgive me if I bust my Nine
I don't wanna get locked up like Shyne
But that's what you get when you're
(Fuckin' widda team, you're fuckin' widda team)
