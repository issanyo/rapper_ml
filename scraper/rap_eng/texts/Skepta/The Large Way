[Intro:] (President T)
Yeah, last time
Back Inna My Face volume one
Going out to Skepta, going out to Meridian, Spider, and it's larger than large
Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Tottenham
The Large Way

[Verse 1:] (President T)
Ok, ok, ok then
I know the names of all these swag MCs but unlike Skepta, I ain't gonna say them
Try that badboy shit on me
Cuz they all know, I ain't long I'll spray them
And these tunes, I don't know a single DJ that will play them
Put grime to one side, bills - still got to pay them
I know serious names but I'd have a 10 grand hit on my head if I ever say them
"Say them what?" Cuz I mean say them names
All this talk about fire at my button, but I can't see no flames
True say I'm an MC, but I don't mean that I play childish games

[Hook:] (President T)
Wanna clash President? It's live
Wanna clash Skepta? It's live
Ok ok then, do it the large way
Wanna clash President? It's live
Wanna clash Skepta? It's live
Ok ok then, do it the large way

[Verse 2:] (Skepta)
Yo yo yo
Long ting, quick ting, ASAP
Send for my big ting, ASAP
Forget a phone call man, ASAP
You're just a small man, dun you ASAP
Taser, ASAP
Brand new 9 volt battery, shock you ASAP
So if you're gonna move to me, move to me ASAP
What? Who me? Skepta scared of who?
I'm not scared of him or his crew
I heard that he stabbed man, but I never cared
He's got a shank - so what, am I supposed to be scared?
Everyday I hear another MC chat about tools they use
But I never see them on Murder Blues, the newspapers, Crimewatch, or BBC News.

[Hook:](President T)
Wanna clash President? It's live
Wanna clash Skepta? It's live
Ok ok then, do it the large way
Wanna clash President? It's live
Wanna clash Skepta? It's live
Ok ok then, do it the large way

[Verse 3:] (President T)
Back Inna My Face? I can't believe he has come back inna my face
Cuz if I ever told you the case
You'd say "President, why d'you put a MAC to his face?"
Little bit of beef, and he wants to go put a MAC to your face
But if I ever showed you his dump of a space
It's so messy that you wouldn't see an inch of space
Why you gotta do it, cuz I've done it already?
All these guys wanna go war, blud they ain't ready
I know guys from countries where you get shot, if you get caught watching the telly
Boy better know I'm from the country, but I ain't Nelly
Lucky that he didn't get a hole in the belly

[Hook:](President T)
Wanna clash President? It's live
Wanna clash Skepta? It's live
Ok ok then, do it the large way
Wanna clash President? It's live
Wanna clash Skepta? It's live
Ok ok then, do it the large way
