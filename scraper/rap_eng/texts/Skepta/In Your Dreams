[Verse 1: Blade Brown]
Let me break it down to them why we ain't in the same bracket
I'm controlling flake traffic, worker's on his 8th packet
(Now what you say Blade?) I said the worker's on his 8th packet
That's why I got those crazy garms brudda, no straitjacket
Me and Skepta we were moving wreckless in Alto
Throwing money, popping bottles, feeling like Alpo
Trust me the South know, it's real when the kid speak
Ask around, dig deep
Bare food, big heat
Fam it's only midweek, I'm a couple gibs deep
Yeah I think I'm Blade Brown, I don't know know no Big Meech
I ain't got a problem with war, I kinda dig beef
You can try and run the firearm's got a big reach
And if that brudda's trapping then he's playing me still
Weighing b deals, yay and e pills
They say that he real cos he say what he feels
I spent Merc S AMG wheels

[Hook: Youngs Teflon]
They don't wanna see us on the scene
I know they pissed off when they see us on the screen
Cah they'd rather see us with the fiends
So I tell em close your eyes and see us in your dreams
(Now what you say youngs) See us in your dreams
New year new money, tryna get it clean
See us in your dreams, see us in your dreams
Close your eyes and see us in your dreams

[Verse 2: Skepta]
They say my eyebrows join in the middle so nobody trust me
They call me the exorcist so when I do my ting don't touch me
White girl in the bed with a cross in her hand screaming Jesus fuck me
But I came with a blade and a teflon vest so I don't give a monkeys
Your girl saw the Moncler gilet and thought I was wearing body armour
28 man's wifeys in my phoneline, somebody pass me a charger
Too many wannabe kings wanna sit in my chair but I'm not a barber
Better take some viagra, wait 20 minutes, then come back harder
I paid the cost to be the boss and that's why I got 5 stars on my shoulders
It's gone past the days when lil Skepta was scared of the olders
Man said he's gonna hit me in the head with a bat, man they're some jokers
The only time them man see more than a grand is
When they get a Christmas bonus
Now they wanna hate on me cos they heard I live young rich and wreckless
You're looking at a brand new two door coupe
When you look at my ring and my necklace
See me on tv no less than 5 times a week but this ain't eastenders
You run around talking like u invented the flow but you know that it's Skepta's
Tef
