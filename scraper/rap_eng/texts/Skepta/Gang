[Intro]
Toddla T on the ones and twos
Yeah

[Chorus]
Man get money with the gang, man get girls with the gang
Man eat food with the gang
Man talk slang so the feds
Can't work out what I just said to a man
Told me you was a big fan, but the first thing
You said when you saw me is "can I get a pic for the gram?"
I’m like "nah, sorry man"
I only socialise with the crew and the gang

[Verse 1]
I woke up at seven in the morning
Checked my iPhone
There's some new software that needs installing
But fuck that, that shit's boring
Four missed calls, Jme’s been calling
Check the messages, Frisco says "wah gwan, G?
The mandem wanna go paintballing"
My ex girl sent me an angry drunk text
And the spelling was appalling
Dead girls saying that they wanna fuck
Even though I used to be nasty like Stormin
Nowadays skets ain't allowed in the room
Tell a girl "bring a couple friends for my goons"
Bun a couple spliff and bill two tunes
Supreme that ain't even out yet, now the girls
Wanna hang around and get high off the fumes

[Chorus]
Man get money with the gang, man get girls with the gang
Man eat food with the gang
Man talk slang so the feds
Can't work out what I just said to a man
Told me you was a big fan, but the first thing
You said when you saw me is "can I get a pic for the gram?"
I'm like "nah, sorry man"
I only socialise with the crew and the gang
