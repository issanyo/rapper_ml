[Hook: Jme]
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms
(I tell dem shut their mout, there's no, because)

[Verse 1: Wiley]
Yo, I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms
When I roll through the end, niggas ring the alarm
I don't like hype and I try and stay calm but
Ain't gonna work cause I'm a street star
When I get a 9 bar, I've gotta move that fast
And you can't say Wiley won't last
More than a blast from the past, I'm sharp because I practice
Jack, you don't really want no arms
Cause I'm your favourite MC, that's why I laugh and
None of your crew can't travel my path
See me on my own, I've got more than half
But I can't take part if I'm too outnumbered
It ain't fair, still, I don't care
I'm eating chicken korma, pilau and naan

[Hook: Jme]
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms
(Listen, shut your mout, there's no)

[Verse 2: Wiley]
Yo, yeah, because we make the hype tracks
Spitters in the game wanna roll with me or
Go against me or try not to pay me
What they owe me or I'm gonna have to hit the road
Smash up your black MG or
You don't wanna get robbed for a ki or
A half box, 9 litre or half [?]
The goons on the door, they par with me or
You? Nah, they par with me or
Other rudeboys from around E3 or
Other rudeboys from E5, E8, E15 and E13 or
N13 or W3 or SW9 and SE3 or
The way I get down on the track's too real
You're looking for the top boy? Yeah, that's me or

[Hook: Jme]
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms
(Listen, shut your mout, there's no)

[Verse 3: Wiley]
Yo, and your girl smells choong when she wears Dior
Speak if you've got a problem with me or
Forever hold your peace and go and drink tea or
Watch me, I'll piss on your family tree or
Spit on the door, let 'em know that it's me or
I'll egg your windows, laugh with me or
Keep a straight face, stand stiff in the place
Can't take my place, not two or three or
I'm number one, you say you can't see or
Might you be lying? Cause he or she saw
No other challengers making P or
Making up ground in the game like we are
I'm a changed character, ain't the same calibre
Don't need a manager, stick with me or
Travel your own path, what am I doing?
Don't ask, I'm perfecting my craft to the T or
Something like that

[Hook: Jme] (x2)
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
I wear my own garms
Man see me on road and want arms
Tell dem shut your mout, there's no qualms
