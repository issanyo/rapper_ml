[Intro: Malcolm X]
No, I don't worry
I tell you
I'm a man who believes that I died 20 years ago
And I live like a man who is dead already
I have no fear whatsoever of anybody or anything

[Hook]
We don't need no security
Stones in my jewellery, what can they do to me?
You murder me, I will live for eternity
If I survive then I'm comin' for you personally
You heard of me
We don't need no security
Stones in my jewellery, what can they do to me?
You murder me, I will live for eternity
If I survive then I'm comin' for you personally

[Verse 1]
Down the fucking drain
Fake celebrities, I will not entertain
No similarities, definitely not the same
Them insecurities, got jealousy on the brain
Dare to go to war with me, then my people bring pain
And I can do it story mode, beginner or insane
Shottys for the back blocks or a spinner for the mains
You're lookin' at your reflection, you hate what you became
That selfish energy, a cranberry stain
Sitting inside my house with a candle and a flame
Working voodoo on you pussies trying to throw faeces on my name
I saw the bigger picture, put 'em all in my frame
To see they're very weak, these guys are super lame
I see you pushing weights, oh, now you're doing gains?
But before the creatine, you was tucking in all your chains
See them at the fashion shows, never see them on the train
I keep the voodoo with me, I suggest you do the same

[Hook]
We don't need no security
Stones in my jewellery, what can they do to me?
You murder me, I will live for eternity
If I survive then I'm comin' for you personally
You heard of me
We don't need no security
Stones in my jewellery, what can they do to me?
You murder me, I will live for eternity
If I survive then I'm comin' for you personally

[Verse 2]
They can see that I'm the one
So they hate
They don't wanna see me shut it down
But I'm on the case
My enemies, they congregate
And they go on dates
Talk about me over food and wine
The fucking snakes
Phoned the paparazzi on yourselves
Man, I thought you were famous
Told them exactly where to find you
Tryna get in the papers
I went out to the village
And I said my prayers
Now I have to wear my shades
Don't wanna scare the neighbours
That's why I see no competition
You might see me whizzing by
Yeah, man, I'm on a mission
And I just put the fisheye
On my tunnel vision
See no evil, hear no evil
Man, I refuse to listen
There he goes
The X-rated
At the awards, intoxicated
The most nominated
And the dress code is understated
Tell Mum I made it
Tell my dad I'll be OK
None of these fools are like your baby boy
In any way, greaze

[Hook]
We don't need no security
Stones in my jewellery, what can they do to me?
You murder me, I will live for eternity
If I survive then I'm comin' for you personally
You heard of me
We don't need no security
Stones in my jewellery, what can they do to me?
You murder me, I will live for eternity
If I survive then I'm comin' for you personally, greaze
