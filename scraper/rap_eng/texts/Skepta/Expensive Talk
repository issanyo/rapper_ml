[Verse 1 : Skepta]
I just got back off my UK tour
Sold it out in a month, now the people are telling me they want some more
Logan came with that exclusive grime you ain't heard before
Then me, P Money and Dirty came and turned it into a nuclear war
After the show jump on the tour bus, a little bit of brandy, a little bit of green
My life is like a movie and any place I go I'm making a scene
It's so funny how them man are so moist but they ain't got cream
That's why I keep on grinding until my pockets are fatter than Cee Lo Green
Now I'm back in the hood surrounded by fake people I can't trust
Wake up in the morning pissed off wishing I was back on the bus
I tell these fake Gs come and test a mainstream MC and see if I don't bust
I'll come to your block and squeeze on your spot until I see pus
Too many little men wanna be the big bad boss but my niggas do the firing
They wanna put the heat to my tee but my niggas do the ironing
Police don't wanna see another black man in the chart but I keep on climbing
Ten million views on WorldStarHipHop, nigga I'm smiling
That's me in Miami on Ocean driving a drop-top Mustang
Dressed in black smoking the green, drinking the purple I'm the murkle man
Laughing all the way to the bank, when I got there, took out two and a half grand
Yellow bandana around the queen's head fam this is the money gang
See I was that guy on Deja 9 2 3 mixing on the roof
Only North London team on the station moving loose
I put my bag down took out my CDs and picked up my juice
Took the scores out my mouth but I had a bit of cling film stuck in my tooth
Fast forward to two-0 double-uno, I'm still in the game
Top 20 album ended a year I'll be doing it again
And if you think them man over there are fly then I must have missed the plane
Duty free, Sunglasses Hut getting some new Versace frames
I pray for a safe journey then I let nature take it's course
My passport wanted a new tattoo so I booked a flight to New York
Me and my niggas in Philippe Chow's getting busy with a knife and fork
Gotta meet some chicks on 65th so fuck driving, we might as well walk
This ain't a freestyle, this is expensive talk (go on then!)
I said this ain't a freestyle, this is expensive talk

[Outro: Whoo Kid]
Can't forget, free Solo 45
