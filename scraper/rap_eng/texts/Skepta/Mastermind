[Chorus: Etta Bond & Skepta]
You're there every time I close my eyes
Dancing in the shadows, playing with the light
I call it mastermind (sexy)
Do it to me
Inside my head
Every time I breath in (ayy)
Every time I breathe in (ayy)
Every time I breathe in

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Paralyzed on this green, now I feel like a garden gnome
Suffering from cannabis psychosis, I'm in a crazy zone
I just called the police and I shouted "Solo's home"
Blame that on the 22,000 voices in my millenium dome (mental)
Celebrity ladies, calling me daily, but I don't answer the phone
She thinks I'm gonna buy her a diamond, she better go to Sierra Leone
I'll be sitting at home, drinking this Patr√≥n until I get a kidney stone
M.O.B. 'til I D.I.E., these bitches can suck my bone (icy)

[Chorus: Etta Bond & Skepta]
You're there every time I close my eyes
Dancing in the shadows, playing with the light
I call it mastermind (sexy)
Do it to me
Inside my head
Every time I breath in (ayy)
Every time I breathe in (ayy)
Every time I breathe in

[Verse 2: Skepta]
One sheet of the Rizla is all I need
Break off a little chip of cigarette and mix it all up with the weed (mmm)
Now I can't remember what we're smoking, is it the OG Kush or the cheese?
All I know is it feels like the room's spinning round at phenomenal speed (mental)
When we talk pussies don't answer back cause we're some rhetorical Gs
I've got niggas on standby waiting to make somebody bleed (bo bo bo bo)
Man try take me for a lemon, I'mma tell them I dare you to squeeze
Next time you see me and my gang, man won't be wearing Boy Better Know tees

[Chorus: Etta Bond & Skepta]
You're there every time I close my eyes
Dancing in the shadows, playing with the light
I call it mastermind (sexy)
Do it to me
Inside my head
Every time I breath in (ayy)
Every time I breathe in (ayy)
Every time I breathe in
