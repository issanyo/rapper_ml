[Verse 1: Skepta]
All my old school teachers wanna beg friend with Joseph
I get dough, bread, Hovis
Me and my paper stick together
Like Sticha and Otis
Girl better know, boy better know this
Bought an R6, got chased by the boy dem and got shift
Then I got a fine and 6 month driving ban so I sold it
I'm on the Tottenham team like Lennon
Meridian Walk, N17
Your mandem turned bad in '07
Wait, can you smell that?
What's that, cheese or lemon?
Wrap that up like a christmas present
Pablo, pass me the ting
I'll shoot from anywhere like David Beckham

[Hook: Paper Pablo]
You must be smoking the rocks
I'll open you up
When I'm holding the Glock
I'll take it over the top
You must be smoking the rocks
I'll open you up
When I'm holding the Glock
I'll take it over the top

[Verse 2: Bossman Birdie]
I make paper
Diss me, I'll put your face in the paper
Ask Skeps, ask Hater
They'll tell you "Bossman, he's a baider"
I carry more weight than a waiter
In my hooded Stone Island blazer
Don't tell me about skeng
'Cause on my gun, I carry laser
I'm hard when I spray
These man couldn't live half what I say
If I showed you what the skeng done to his head
The judge would've gave me life that day
Can't stop now, it's too late
I'm infamous, face is bait
Hold tight Junior, shout out Drake
One gunshot, Meridian estate

[Hook: Paper Pablo]
You must be smoking the rocks
I'll open you up
When I'm holding the Glock
I'll take it over the top
You must be smoking the rocks
I'll open you up
When I'm holding the Glock
I'll take it over the top

[Verse 3: Big H]
Back to the jungle, back to my roots
Tell Pablo strap up the zoots
Call up the soldiers, bring out the troops
Just like Stryder, tings in boots
Man all a handstand, jump through hoops
I don't wanna hear about abandon group
18 shots that will take off roots
Hold tight the olders, big up the youts
Can't ask me why I look vexed
It's not Wretch, it's not Ghetts
It's not Jay-Z or DMX
Spray up the place and ask who's next
Send for your armour, put on your vest
That don't matter, I will step in your chest
18 shots leave a man in a mess
H corporation, you know the rest

[Hook: Paper Pablo]
You must be smoking the rocks
I'll open you up
When I'm holding the Glock
I'll take it over the top
You must be smoking the rocks
I'll open you up
When I'm holding the Glock
I'll take it over the top

You must be smoking the rocks
I'll open you up
When I'm holding the Glock
I'll take it over the top
You must be smoking the rocks
I'll open you up
When I'm holding the Glock
I'll take it over the top
