[Intro: Skepta & a Waiter]
You alright there mate, ready to order?
Yeah, can I have um, can I have a hot choc-, nah actually can I have a tea yeah, please
And um, a English breakfast
Full English? Bacon? Sausages?
Nah, nah, nah, no pork, no pork, nah I don't want no pork

[Verse 1]
This little piggy thinks I don't wanna ring him
Cause I got beats I don't wanna give him
Boy Better Know makin' a killin'
So I don't wanna step up in a riddim with him
Life used to be hard but now I can't lie man are sitting in my front room just chilling
Everybody laughing, smiling, grinning
Dem man are losing, us man are winning
This little piggy think that I weren't robbing
That I never had food and I weren't shottin'
Alright let's get this ting poppin'
One gun, one bullet and I put him on it
Life used to be hard but now I can't lie man are like, "Wagwarn, let's go shopping"
Boy Better Know still chart topping
Forget a red light, manaman ain't stoppin'

[Hook]
I want a english breakfast
Pass me a knife and a fork
One tea, one hash brown baked beans and eggs
But I don't wanna see no pork
I want a english breakfast
Pass me a knife and a fork
One tea, one hash brown baked beans and eggs
But I don't wanna see no pork

[Verse 2]
This little piggy think's he's scary
I told him not a lot of things scare me
I'm in the mirror screaming Bloody Mary
With all the bloody mandem right near me
My man are united like Giggs, I will never leave my young gunners like Thierry
Wow, that metaphor's scary
Let me say that again, listen up
I said my man are united like Giggs, I will never leave my young gunners like Thierry
Sometimes I think man don't hear me
Since early number 1, sincerely
Lyrically, there's nobody near me
I'm a beast, look at my arms, they're hairy
In a party I spit loud and clearly
It goes off, trust me the flow's dairy

[Hook]
I want a english breakfast
Pass me a knife and a fork
One tea, one hash brown baked beans and eggs
But I don't wanna see no pork
I want a english breakfast
Pass me a knife and a fork
One tea, one hash brown baked beans and eggs
But I don't wanna see no pork

[Verse 3]
This little piggy thinks that I like him
That I listen to his songs and I bite him
Somebody better advise him, stop piping the white ting on a hype ting
I don't what makes them think I think about their shit bars when I'm writing
You man over there ain't vibsing
You do your ting, I do my ting
This little piggy thinks that he's on it
'Cause he got a CD full of grease on it
He's not a badboy, I'll put P's on it
Every last penny in my LV wallet
I love my hood 'till I stop breathing but sitting in the hood don't make me profit
A lot of these MC's make me vomit
Talk about real but you're far from it

[Hook]
I want a english breakfast
Pass me a knife and a fork
One tea, one hash brown baked beans and eggs
But I don't wanna see no pork
I want a english breakfast
Pass me a knife and a fork
One tea, one hash brown baked beans and eggs
But I don't wanna see no pork

I want a english breakfast (Skepta)
Pass me a knife and a fork (Boy Better Know)
One tea, one hash brown baked beans and eggs
But I don't wanna see no pork (doinitagain.com)
I want a english breakfast
Pass me a knife and a fork (Yeah)
One tea, one hash brown baked beans and eggs
But I don't wanna see no pork
Boy Better Know
