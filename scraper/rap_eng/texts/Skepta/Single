[Intro]
And this tune is for all the single ladies
We just wanna know
Are you gonna take us home tonight
Can you take us home please
We'll be out in the morning
I swear

[Verse 1]
It's Friday night, time to get dressed
Raving time, just to impress
Make sure your hair don't look like a mess
Got a little spray, gotta stay fresh
Bad to the bone
If you ain't got a haircut, draw for your afro comb
Got you car keys and your mobile phone
That's how you get girls to take you home
Just because the lady looks cute
She took more phone numbers than the loot
So before you knock boots
Make sure you put on your hat with your birthday suit
She wants you to come around and stay
She said a one night stand's okay
I'd say what Clint Eastwood would say
"Go ahead, make my day"

[Hook x2]
If you're single, then mingle
If he's buff, put his number inside your mobile phone
If you wanna take him home
Go one then, go one then

[Verse 2]
Some girls wear pink, some wear brown
Some wear more makeup than a clown
But before you start looking around
Cloak room time, draw for the pound
Put in your coat, look for the ladies
Single ladies, one's with Bailey's
White, black, I don't really care
Long as you were born in the early 80's
Just because the lady looks cute
She took more phone numbers than the loot
So before you knock boots
Make sure you put on your hat with your birthday suit
All these questions hurting my head
She want's to know if I'm live or dead
So I said what Shabba Ranks said
"I am bad, mad and wicked in a bed"

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I don't understand why every girl
Thinks a one night stand is the end of the world
I ain't asking for your hand in marriage
I just want a ride in your horse and carriage
That was a disrespect, I apologise, I don't mean to be cruel
But what do you expect when you come to the rave with four footballs
Just because the lady looks cute
She took more phone numbers than the loot
So before you knock boots
Make sure you put on your hat with your birthday suit
I ain't gonna run back and tell my whole crew
I'm a big man, I'm 22
We'll do what Ja Rule and Christina do
"Anything we do is between me and you"

[Hook x4]

[Outro]
Go on then, go on then
Yeah if you're single just mingle man
If you find a buff boy
Put his number in your mobile phone
And if you wanna take him home after that
Take him home
Kick him out in the morning
Back to normal life innit
Until next Friday
