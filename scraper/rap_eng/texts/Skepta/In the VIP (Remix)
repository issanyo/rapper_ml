(Your name's not Dan, you're not coming in)

[Intro: Majestic]
They don't wanna let me in
So I brought a few friends that could get me in
Skepta, B Live, Shorty, Jme
We run the whole club like they're paying me
Come on girls, say there's all the man dem
The famous guy and microphone champion
Now give me two sips of the champs
Audi's outside, don't care about clamps

[Hook: Majestic]
In the VIP
In the VIP
In the VIP (in the VIP)
In the VIP
Flash up your phone in the VIP
Raise your glass in the VIP
Put your hands up in the VIP
In the VIP (in the VIP)

[Verse 1: B Live]
I walked to the door, look, I MC
I'm going into the VIP
Send me the waitress, order the champagne
Paid her a bill and a T-I-P
Now I am lean
So I gave her a T-I-P
I said "send them girls over here for me
Majestic and Shorty and Jme"
I'm like a 16 B-I-T
Plus she got them T-I-Ts
But when she saw Skeppy, she left man
She told me all she wants is a P-I-C
Uh, but that's an L-I-E
All she wants is D-I-C-K
But that's all good
I'm in the VI-, I'm in the VIP-P

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yo, me and B came in the Audi to the venue
Walked in, picked up the menu
Said to the waitress "give me them two"
Then I said "B Live, look at them two"
Called one over, B Live looked straight through her
Said he already done a madness to her
But I don't give a shit about that, mate
Come to my house, beware of the flatmate

[Verse 3]
Skeppy, we can't get to the flat, mate
Look at the Audi, we got a flat, mate
The rear wheel is as flat as a pancake
And the backside of my one is a flat rate
So it's a pat on the back, mate
And I got a backpack full of straps, mate
So when she's playing the hard part
Know she be sniffing that shit like an aardvark

[Verse 4: Shorty]
I'm in the VIP and I feel like a champion
You can't stand here if you're not man dem
Girls crowding me cause I'm handsome
They like how I said BBK
I'm on a vibezing ting, you know how I play
We party like it's our last day
Might see me in the VIP
In plain clothes but I ain't CID

[Verse 5: Jme]
It's me in the VIP
Same tee I wore on SB.TV
Spend P stupid like I've done an AC
I've got a Macy Gray afro, crazy
I'm holding car keys, not champs
Bouncers are staring at me like zamps
Before you trouble me, understand
Man are badman, don't need no wristband

[Verse 6: Jammer]
Cuh man are bigger than big, man are BIG
Just Cavalli, D&G
Fresh to death, yeah, me and C
C Gritz is my D-O-G
We get girls, hotel ting, cuz, no B&B
On the track I see in 3
Gritz woke up in the A&E
The last time we was in the VIP

[Verse 7: C Gritz]
I just left my G-I-G
Blew up the place like TNT
Dances, they want VIP
Like a fat kid crying for a P-I-E
I'm so drunk, acting like a D-I-V
Went to the bar, said "give me an E-N-G"
Party animal till I D-I-E
I'm that prince, that [?]
