[Intro: Skepta, Drake & (Idris Elba)]
Yo, man's never seen Idris in the studio when it's shutdown
Truss mi daddi
Hold tight Skept, hold tight the crew, hold tight, (7 Wallace)

[Verse 1: Idris Elba]
I've been shut down, got up again, swear man ah na sufferin'
No opinions out your mans and them, gone, clear, vanishing
Apocalypse, been cancelling
Wallace Road, I've been smashin' them
Now I'm on a remix, said it's shutdown
And I got you looking at the world, bafflin'
It's ok cause I'm acting like I'm rapping, but I'm slapping
My dick into them faces of them haters while I'm cashin' in
Super friends, down with them, I'm here with that new sound
I'm here to shut you down, run your mouth and go tell a friend
See that Wire? Shut it down, ain't nobody else selling brown
Ain't nobody else Stringer Bell, boy from the East End did well, man
You see Mandela, man a shut it down, ain't nobody else touchin' that
Ain't nobody tryna fuck with Denz, this my time on the new gents
Ya'll need a score
I ain't sittin' on the bench, I ain't second in command, nah man I'm knocking down them doors
I ain't livin' on the fence, I ain't runnin' up my gums, now man I'm runnin' up my draws
And I murdered ya, Luther
Have you heard 'bout that rumour yeah?
(Truss me daddi) Shutdown

[Hook: Skepta]
When it's Shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah, take time if a man wanna try me, no time
Usain Bolt when I run up on stage
I pick up the mic and it's reload time
Don't know your songs but they know mine
That's why I got gigs just like Joe Grind
After the show I be rolling mine
Don't care bout the no smoking sign
They try to steal my vision
This ain't a culture, it's my religion
God knows I don't wanna go prison
But if a man wanna try me, trust me listen
Me and my G's ain't scared of police
We don't listen to no politician
Everybody on the same mission
We don't care about your -ism and -cisms
Cause it's

[Hook]

[Skit]
A bunch of young men all dressed in black dancing extremely aggressively on stage, it made me feel so intimidated and it's just not what I expect to see on prime time TV

[Verse 3: Skepta]
I'm in a different class
When I get through I'mma bring my dargs
2 by 2, man a walk on the ark
Sittin' at the front, it's like Rosa Parks
Trust me, you don't wanna see me get dark
Upset cause man are way up right now
And the shit happened all so fast
I was in Paris, shut down l'Arc
New York, shut down Central Park
Talk about London, yo Frisco where shall I start?
Walked in, spat ten 16 bars
And each and every one of them came from the heart
None of my lyrics are stolen
"Go on then, go on then", that's my slogan
Wanna know how I did it with no label
No A-list songs, and I told them
Blud, I just

[Hook: Skepta]

[Outro: Drake]
Link up Daddy
All right
Yo tomorrow I'm gonna come scoop you, we'll go to Biz's
Yeah for sure
All right
Dun know
