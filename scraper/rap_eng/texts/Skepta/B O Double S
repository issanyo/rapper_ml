[Hook: Jewels & Skepta]
B O double S, yes
A shoulder you can lean on
A business man with a business plan
And I'mma put my whole team on
I walk like a boss, I talk like a boss
I play my position, of course I'm a boss
I walk like a boss, I talk like a boss
And I'mma put my whole team on

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Let's get gully
Me and my niggas, we're all lovey dovey
I'm laughin' all the way to the bank cause it's funny
The cashier sings my songs when she counts my money
I took out a grand, it had a red band
Tied around the queen's head like a blood's bandana
I ain't got a chain like Juelz Santana
But these girls are pulling on me like a Christmas cracker
Fuck swagger, famalam, I'm hard
I should be a drug dealer with these bars
I already told 'em it's 2000-and-ours
My shit so heavy, the toilet water splashin' on my arse
I make the coldest lady melt
Under my collar's where I wear my belt
I ain't lookin' any ratings from anybody else
I'm a straight wanker, I'm feelin' myself, alright then

[Hook: Jewels & Skepta]
B O double S, yes
A shoulder you can lean on
A business man with a business plan
And I'mma put my whole team on
I walk like a boss, I talk like a boss
I play my position, of course I'm a boss
I walk like a boss, I talk like a boss
And I'mma put my whole team on

[Verse 2: Fem Fel]
North to the 'Nam
They hate cause I've always got something on my arm
It's bait that my goonbags roll with the star
Stop acting like you really want something in the car
Wasteman
Counting money all day, I went bed late
Food circulating online like a sextape
Let me explain
I've seen more bones than an X-ray
Nightclub queue for what?
I'm a boss so I only use queues to pot
Few close calls tryna lose the cops
Got niggas still saying that I'm due to flop, um
Rolling in the super [?]
No need for a ki and I ain't used the clock
No need for the Ps? You must be mad
Got my French chain swinging like a boxing bag
Felon

[Hook: Jewels & Skepta]
B O double S, yes
A shoulder you can lean on
A business man with a business plan
And I'mma put my whole team on
I walk like a boss, I talk like a boss
I play my position, of course I'm a boss
I walk like a boss, I talk like a boss
And I'mma put my whole team on

[Verse 3: Skepta & Fem Fel]
Yeah, I don't care what it costs
I'm bringing all the mandem so we can all floss
Keep showing off, thinking you're the boss
Until the taxman gets you in a headlock
And now you can't breathe, you're gasping for breath
Or screaming Tottenham, Pecknam to the death
If I get it for me, then I get it for the rest
See me at the bar pulling out cards like a ref, yes
See, we all about 'Lizabeth, straight paper boys
We rob, get it in daily, and waste the coins
These rappers just make a noise
And roll with the white girl like the Fazer boy
Couple niggas still screwing me
But I frown on you pricks like truancy
Jewels, let 'em hear the hook
And let 'em know who the boss cuh these brehs are shook, uh

[Hook: Jewels & Skepta]
B O double S, yes
A shoulder you can lean on
A business man with a business plan
And I'mma put my whole team on
I walk like a boss, I talk like a boss
I play my position, of course I'm a boss
I walk like a boss, I talk like a boss
And I'mma put my whole team on

[Hook: Jewels & Skepta]
B O double S, yes
A shoulder you can lean on
A business man with a business plan
And I'mma put my whole team on
I walk like a boss, I talk like a boss
I play my position, of course I'm a boss
I walk like a boss, I talk like a boss
And I'mma put my whole team on
