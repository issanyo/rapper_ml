[Verse 1]
Like one two three four
Four one over the top more
Listen
They call me S.K.E.P.P.Y
I got the whole game open
Niggas in jail listening to Logan
Dwight just had a free
Came home looking like the black version of Hulk Hogan
Now us man are moving smoothly
You man are still moving bookey
Triplets, Junior and Lukey
Keeping it real cause this ain't a movie
They wanna know why I'm always angry
Why I need a machine like a factory
I tell them watch this
Can you see that?
Exactly
I can't make nobody jack me
I make a man run around like an athlete
Meridian, come follow me

[Hook]
Me and my mandem are making paper we don't care about you
Wanna kill him better kill me too
It's so easy like two plus two
Me and my mandem are making paper we don't care about you
Wanna kill him better kill me too
It's so easy like two plus two

[Verse 2]
I told them when I get started I won't stop
I cleaned up with a broom and a mop
Now I got IBS on my intestine feeling like it's tied in a knot
It must be all the champagne
I'm a dan like Mark Anzaine
Heavy weight champion so you know I had to get Frank Warren on my album campaign
A lot of moneys exchanged in accounts
Stupid amounts
All your cheques are like a basketball
They bounce
You man are air like Michael Jordan
Better still you man are like Rodman
Big shout to my niggas in Tottenham
That love me like they love Game in Compton

[Hook]
Me and my mandem are making paper we don't care about you
Wanna kill him better kill me too
It's so easy like two plus two
Me and my mandem are making paper we don't care about you
Wanna kill him better kill me too
It's so easy like two plus two

[Verse 3]
I already told them Meridian are gonna last longer
But you thought your team was stronger
So I gotta start slapping MC's in the face
E.Honda
Its the return of the monster
Boy Better Know is the team I sponsor
Them MC's won't last in a war
Better put more nail varnish on your conker
Caution
It's a North London extortion
I put a 2 inch hole in the organ
Get away quicker than Flash Gordon
Chipmunk in my CD Walkman
I been doing this since Adidas Torsion
Still sitting here thinking what would it be like if she never had the abortion

[Hook]
Me and my mandem are making paper we don't care about you
Wanna kill him better kill me too
It's so easy like two plus two
Me and my mandem are making paper we don't care about you
Wanna kill him better kill me too
It's so easy like two plus two

Me and my mandem are making paper we don't care about you
Wanna kill him better kill me too
It's so easy like two plus two
Me and my mandem are making paper we don't care about you
Wanna kill him better kill me too
It's so easy like two plus two
