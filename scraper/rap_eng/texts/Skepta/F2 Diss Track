(Intro: Both)
Yes, Stephen
And Big Poppa Smith
Did you get me JME?
Nah, he's busy lad
Never mind
This one goes out to the Hungry Professor
The Man. The Myth. The Legend

(Verse 1: Stephen Tries)
Nah, that’s not me
Act like a wetwipe in your Audi
Injured again? Yeah that's Billy
Lose to XO (at Wembley)
Yeah, I used to wear your tee
Put it all in the bin cause I'm not 13 (True)
I used to like the F2
But stop saying ’swaz'
You're nearly 40
It's the return of the Max
0161 written on my back
Loz in defence and Brian in attack
One nil up everybody's like (CLAP)
Flashback to the group stage, what a laugh
Blaming the refs, you don't wanna show that
Lost to the team in white and black
Score a screamer, the crowd goes... (twat)
Anytime we see Jez take a shot
Boy better know it's landing up in row G
Only score when the goal is empty
Forget Messi, more like Hesky
Don't have tears when it ends
Celebrating when you lose on pens
Last time was boys versus men
And trust me we’re gonna do it again

(Chorus: Stephen Tries)
Nah, that’s not me
Act like a wetwipe in your Audi
Injured again? Yeah that's Billy
Fucked it up, on BGT
Yeah, I used to rate your team
Until it became Love Island FC
True, I used to love the F2
But acting like divas, that’s not me
