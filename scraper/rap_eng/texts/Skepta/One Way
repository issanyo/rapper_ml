[Chorus: Suspect]
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Road rage like "you what, mate?"
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Road rage like "you what, mate?"

[Verse 1: Suspect]
Ayy, ayy, wrong way down a one-way
Niggas grew up the wrong way
Only showed us that trap pays
All we knew was that gunplay
Partying on a Sunday
On the strip moving mad bait
Oh shit, there's the squal√©
Wrong way down a one-way
Never knew a nigga had dreams, though
True say I did it with ease, though
I remember times no one would fucking listen
Had to get myself up and out the kitchen
No more Pyrex vision now
More like cheques and we're skipping clouds
At this rate, little man'll never have to worry
About his pops, I'll be sitting down

[Chorus: Suspect]
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Road rage like "you what, mate?"
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Road rage like "you what?", like "you what?"

[Verse 2: Jesse James Solomon]
I'm baking off with the bacons-ns
I don't deal with no pagans-ns
Wooly road where they made me in
I broke out, no more breaking in
I'm in the background, blending in
Shades on and a vengeance grin
With my goonies, all gremlined off
Remember us from that bendy bus?
These niggas wanna act all tough
Remember when we used to send them shop
Wrong way down the one-way
They look at us and think "one day"
Packed off on a Sunday
I'm baking off with a one bae
I said I'm baking off w-, baking
I said I'm baking off with a one bae

[Chorus: Suspect & Skepta]
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Road rage like "you what, mate?"
Wrong way down a one-way (wrong way)
Wrong way down a one-way (wrong way)
Wrong way down a one-way (greaze)
Road rage like "you what, mate?" (yeah)

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Drive-by and I'm speeding
Lights shine on the ceiling (sexy)
Forgot to have dinner this evening
'Cause time flies when you're eating (true)
Must be the books that you're reading
The idolising and preaching (shh)
Women's world, we don't watch niggas (nah)
Soon as I get the money, I'm leaving (greaze)
Champagne on my SKs (spills)
Zoot in the mouth when I'm pouring
Tryna stay awake till the morning (yeah)
'Cause going to sleep is just boring (yeah)
Was a young boy when I stopped caring
Them times when I had Dipset blaring
Dad told me not to get two earrings (shing)
Man, I'm so hard of hearing (icy)

[Chorus: Suspect & Jesse James Solomon]
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Road rage like "you what, mate?"
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
Wrong way down a one-way
I said I'm baking off, I said I'm baking off
