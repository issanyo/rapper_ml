[Intro]
Greatness
Know your surname
La musica de Harry Fraud
Greaze

[Verse]
Who are they? I don't know them, sittin' there with their cameras open
Takin' sneaky pics like paparazzi, they can't wait to upload them
They're dyin' to post them (mental)
I catch 'em filming, I expose 'em, don't play with my emotions
More THC, more serotonin, more THC, more serotonin
This ain't a flow that is normally chosen
Still I get dark and turn into the Omen
Niggas say they got guns but don't know how to load them
I talk to the shooter on text I never ever ever phone him

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah
Who gon' beef with me?
How dare you have beef with me
Greaze

[Outro]
...Alone in that darkness
Slowly, daylight crept in through the bandages and I can see
But something else had changed inside me
