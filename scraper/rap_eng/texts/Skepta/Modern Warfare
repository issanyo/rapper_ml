[Verse 1: B Live]
If a man try diss me, off with his head
Off with his kneecaps, off with his legs
Man said warfare
So I called up D Double E, Footsie and Skeps
Dem man are chat 'bout dem man's business
Like dem manaman are manaman's skets
But forget the whispers
When it's silent, you'll hear the squeeze of the trigger
Silence, when I beat on the silencer
Silence MCs when I speak on a Silencer beat
Only where the wildest compete
Don't try me, you can't murk me though, cuz
You should've got out early and rush
Cause I pre-ejaculate
In the beef and I pull out early and buss

[Verse 2: D Double E]
It smelly a bit warry, blud
I heard you wanna bore me, blud
What happened when you saw me, blud?
It was a whole different story, blud
Cause you didn't wanna war, you ignored me, blud
What happened to the plan you had for me, blud?
All that talk about boring
You're gonna be the one that's boring, blud
Do you really wanna see it get gory, blud?
I've heard all these different stories, blud
You're too late for sorry
Get found in the back of the lorry
So 'llow the talk show, it ain't Maury
You can't hold me back from glory, blud
If I was you, I'd worry
And make a move somewhere down Surrey

[Hook: Spyda]
Di war start and feelings are carried
Nobody want fi say that dem sorry
Nobody nuh talk, no one never hear
Cuh dis one ah modernised warfare
Di war start and feelings are carried
Nobody want fi say that dem sorry
Nobody nuh talk, no one never hear
Cuh dis one ah modernised warfare

[Verse 3: Skepta]
If it's lyrical warfare, I'm ready for this
I'll put a big advert on the telly for this
This one's grimy, call Teddy for this
Get a camera, this one's gonna be one to remember
I roll with the gunners like Arsene Wenger
Light this up like the 5th of November
Trust me, it's a Guy Fawkes ting
Man better take cover when I walk in
They wanna diss me cause I'm on tour
Think that I can't see shit, but I saw
If I told my nigga in the hood to bring a ting
Boy Better Know it's not gonna be a rebore
99%, it's an auto
So you better respect your torso
Put a parting in your head like cornrow
We don't wanna hear you no more, so shut up

[Verse 4: Footsie]
Shh, don't say nuttin'
Dem man are fronting, you don't spray nuttin'
If the feds come around here asking questions
Shh, we don't say nuttin'
We don't say nought
When the war's on, mandem are warring out
When the war's on, man ah war all day long
I'm a general, know that my army's strong
Bare soldiers
Youngers, olders
Males, females
Drugs, retail
Small bits, wholesale
Straight cash, no bell
Food's fresh, not stale
And if I get locked, no bail

[Hook: Spyda]
Di war start and feelings are carried
Nobody want fi say that dem sorry
Nobody nuh talk, no one never hear
Cuh dis one ah modernised warfare
Di war start and feelings are carried
Nobody want fi say that dem sorry
Nobody nuh talk, no one never hear
Cuh dis one ah modernised warfare
