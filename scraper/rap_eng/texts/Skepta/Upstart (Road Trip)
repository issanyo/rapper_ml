[Intro: Skepta]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Yeah, I'm on my own, Macaulay Culkin, home alone
I can't find my spaceship
No escape, everyday I be in your face
Better hit the kill switch
I see it in your eyes, don't lie, you're scared to die
You're looking frantic
I heard it's kicking off, fuck 'em all, I'm switching off
Can't take this fake shit

[Chorus: Skepta]
'Cause I'm an upstart
I'm feeling uptight
Road trip
Gang shit
The streets are ours tonight

[Verse 2: Skepta]
You've blown a fuse, broke a hammer
Lost the screws, I have to fix this
I'm on the edge, monsters underneath the bed
We do the night shift

[Chorus 2: Skepta]
'Cause I'm an upstart
And I'm not paranoid
I'm an upstart
I'm not your android

[Bridge: Skepta]
What'd you mean, turn it down?
Say that again, I'mma burn this down
Rest in peace to the man that falls off next
And I ain't scared of the wall of death
'Cause Satan knows
When it comes to Judgement Day
I'mma trick him up and rip all his clothes
Beat him up and take all his hoes

[Chorus 3: Skepta]
'Cause I'm an upstart
I'm an up-start
Active boys
I'm not your android
I'm an upstart
Self-made
Nothing like you, free man
Greaze
