[Intro: Skepta]
SK, easy
AR15, N17
Meridian Walk
Straight out the T-O-T
Icy

[Verse 1: Skepta]
I used to smile in pictures, but the ends changed me
Dad told me protect Jason, protect Julie and protect Jamie
Remember I first bought my strap
I was lookin' in the mirror and I went crazy
I never knew Posty, didn't wanna freestyle
Them times it was Skeng Daily
I had 13 scores in my mouth, ridin' from house to house
You would've thought I was a courier
So much money on the microwave
The shit looks like a photocopier
And I could probably make another score
With the crack residue in the buttons of the Nokia
Prayin' to God, please show me the light
Cause the trap house looks like Hollister

[Hook: Skepta]
I spoke to my mumsy on the weekend
Told her I'm gonna be a G to the end
But this time, man are doin' it legal
The police can't see me again
They can't see me again
They can't see me again
They can't see me again
Nah, they can't see me again
Spoke to my mumsy on the weekend
Told her I'm gonna be a G to the end
But this time, man are doin' it legal
The police can't see me again
They can't see me again
They can't see me again
They can't see me again
Nah, they can't see me again

[Verse 2: Bashy]
It's me again
Yeah I'm gone again so they can't see me again
Never go where them Pagans go
You won't see me with them
It's no new friends, no new friends
No new friends, no, no, no
Cause where I'm from, bruv, it ain't a joke
Mans are takin' off heads like it's Game of Thrones
This year, it's fuck everybody
Anybody's gettin' bodied
Nobody helped me... nobody, nobody
Cause when you're not hot, everybody's movin' dodgy
Now they gotta recognise
10 years later, later!
Ever since Sega, I had a mega drive
Fuck all the gas, I'm just tryna be peaceful
I ain't in the street or industry, I'm at home with my peoples
I used to be a wretch, shout out 32
Could've been dead, all the shit that I've been through
Now my legal hustle's so sick, you could say it's illegal

[Hook: Skepta]
I spoke to my mumsy on the weekend
Told her I'm gonna be a G to the end
But this time, man are doin' it legal
The police can't see me again
They can't see me again
They can't see me again
They can't see me again
Nah, they can't see me again
Spoke to my mumsy on the weekend
Told her I'm gonna be a G to the end
But this time, man are doin' it legal
The police can't see me again
They can't see me again
They can't see me again
They can't see me again
Nah, they can't see me again

[Verse 3: Kano]
Tell a soundboy wheel it again, then leave in the Benz
Why would I wanna open a box, and play Deal or No Deal in the ends?
Tell a hater I'm on a TV again
And through the ad break, might see me again
SMS, BB, begfriend, I must look like Phoebe to them
You'll get deleted, back out my [?]
Been about this since [?], my don
Linked up with the Tottenham squad
Tell Daniel Levy I need that
Adi money and I want it weekly
World class, check a man's CV
Catalogue, check a man's PC
Tickets, them likkle PG's
Parental guidance, run from the sirens
Come from the pirates, dun know the islands
Paid me in fivers, now it's a minor
Transferrin' wires before I see pilots
Pack couple tees and a vest, cup of tea and some eggs
And I text my mumsy when I landed
Told her I'm gonna be a G to the death

[Hook: Skepta]
I spoke to my mumsy on the weekend

They can't see me again
Nah, they can't see me again
