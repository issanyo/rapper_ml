[Intro: Fury]
Yeah Plasticman on the buttons right now, the all-stars;
JME, SERIOUS
Tinchy Stryder, yeah I'm back you know
Skepta, Shut Ya Mouth
And myself Fury, Listen up, take it all in

[Verse 1: Jme]
I will make all your bredrin say, "Ohhhh shit" when they hear my lyrics
He's like "Jme's nang did you hear what he said you get me fam, hey blud listen to this!"
And he'll show all his bredrin and that, and they'll be like "rahhhhted cuz I never knew he said that!"

[Verse 2: Tinchy Stryder]
Look I put the work in, I stop the flows I'm blazin' or jerkin'
Non-stop though I'm raging straight breaking Stryds I'm pullin' em off
I'm straight murkin' I'm so certain
On straps and flows on a daily mainly 30 tunes on a daily
I'm back on U TV if you don't know [?]

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Yo anytime you see me wearin' a glove, boy better know I've got a gun in my boxers
I don't wanna send an MC to the doctors, I just wanna win a MOBO then go for the Oscars
There's only one Skepta so I gotta link down any impostors, lick off your head like innocent fosters
Can't take skengman for Pocahontas

[Verse 4: Fury]
[?]
But don;t get twisted, girls will get lifted and taken out of the ground
It's only a matter of time cause I roll like a 38 I have a dirty date
My flow's overweight I can't back cause I spray like a 38 I don't hesitate

[Verse 5: Jme]
Blud, that's easy, writing them bars is nothing, I write them bars with ease
And that's why I've got enough of them, you don't know what's in them like ease
You listen properly and enough of them will back for you so easily, and that's why you can't get enough of them

[Verse 6: Tinchy Stryder]
I'm Stryds I'm back I pack flows and I pick more rhymes I spit I leave MC's real sort
I can't I won't jam like a rebore I'll still pack flows like heat so I'll squeeze off
When I enter the rave some deep sort mark for the doors in the rave like I want war
They can't see me man it's like beef war, been through ups and downs like a seesaw

[Verse 7: Skepta]
Oi Skepta why you murkin' so many man? That's the word on the road
I know wicked man in my postcode that will sniff two lines and go into devilish mode
Shoot you in the face then skid round the corner like yoshi and toad, so for your own good
Trust me you don't wanna see man on your road

[Verse 8: Fury]
I stepped in the game for my chore, I've seen messed up things but I trust in the Lord
Bars are my witness a knife is my sword, can't stop spitting till I sekkle the score
Sekkle your jaw spitting one four in war, spit a metal four with force
Spit a better four of course spit another metaphor better turn what I done before

[Verse 9: Jme]
Alright rudeboy, you think you're big see, I can tell you think you're big cause
When you talk you're in some mood, like you're super, you're too rude
Enough of these guys, i've got shit to prove, all this arrogant shit just move
You think you're big see you run up your mouth, I know you ain't big, come to my house

[Verse 10: Tinchy Stryder]
You won't see me downin' beers I'm a Lord of the Mics too clash in 'ere
I'm not one to be dashing chairs when the beef is on
Tempers flare I'm ripping on the riddim still changing gears
Who's next to my face in here Stryder man I'm still raisin' hairs
Soundboys know I'm frightenin' here

[Verse 11: Skepta]
Right about now Bossman's in jail, I'm gonna speak on Merrick's behalf, murder charge ain't a joke and laugh
Think that you're shower but you can't even jump in the bath
I know the skengman that do Opia voodoo and witchcraft
Roll with a 10 month old baby so they can bring out the mash and need a blue scarf

[Verse 12: Fury]
You pricks won't hit the Richter scale, I predict that you pricks will fail
I predict my LP will sell, run your mouth and Fury brings hell
You pricks won't hit the Richter scale, I predict that you pricks will fail
I predict my LP will sell, run your mouth and Fury brings hell

[Verse 13: Jme]
Come to my door, and you'll see I don't care what anybody says I'm me
I don't change from Jamie to Jme, it's all the same, it's nothing to me
But you change, you go wild, how old are you, you act like a child
Chat bare shit and you act all dumb, I know that's not how you chat to your mum

[Verse 14: Tinchy Stryder]
And I know myself and I'm not on the roof but, life ain't great so I max in loops
I feel to lose my corner I boy in, get ruthless like one of them coups
Man better know I'm in the [?] ... I'm talkin' loose
Take couple draw [?] so I kick back and scheme on the dude

[Verse 15: Skepta]
Last thing you hear is a bang and a scream
Bare mash man want me on their team cause they know from I lick shots heads are coming off clean
I'll put a bullet in your bean, bullet in your cainrow, bullet in your lean
Put on the safety and switch off the bean
Wipe your blood off my Technomarine
Whaddya mean

[Verse 16: Fury]
New bar tippin' MC's with new scars, new flows hittin' MC's with killer blows, new rhymes rippin' MC's with no time
New Fury but I'm twice as angry
New bar tippin' MC's with new scars, new flows hittin' MC's with killer blows, new rhymes rippin' MC's with no time
New Fury but I'm twice as twice as

[Verse 17: Jme]
Alright rudeboy, allow the hype, you're chattin' shit, put down the mic
See in two years you're gonna pull out the pipe, send for the rocks pull out the light
If I was you I'd sit down tonight, read them bars you decide to write
And think carefully before I put my dutty lips around the mic
