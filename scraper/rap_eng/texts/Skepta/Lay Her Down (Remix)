[Verse 1: Skepta]
You’re telling people you don’t like me
Real killers never make a sound
All my niggas beside me
Shoot that motherfucker down
This pretty lady said she likes me
But she heard I get around
So when I see her
I swear to Jesus, I'm a lay her down

[Hook: Skepta]
I'm a lay her down, lay her down
I'm a lay her down, lay her down
I'm a lay her down, lay her down
I'm a lay her down, lay her down

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Don’t need to say you love me 10 times
I can feel it in the air
I just wanna be your Dev Hynes
And you can be my Jessie Ware
Dreams of this queen inside my bedroom
Wearing nothing but a crown
Oh when I see her
I swear to Jesus, I'm a lay her down

[Hook: Skepta]

[Verse 3: Kano]
Uh, get fresh then I step out
Dig the red bottom crep out
So many girls around
You would've thought that it was Hugh Hef now
Down down down down down I lay-er
If a gyal look buff, then I slay-er
And if the jugs dem are big like Katy
Perry then me haffi John Mayer
I swear to Jesus, no pieces
I copped a Porsche, no leases
We both hear whistles and flutes now
Fuck yo [?]
London to Manny in a sec
Got the mandem on deck
Got the gyaldem all wet
AMG livin', cause damage on the M
One when I come vrum vrum

[Bridge: Skepta]
I'mma lay her down
I just wanna feel your skin
Against mine
If it's the last thing I do
I swear to...I swear to Jesus

[Hook: Skepta]

[Outro: Skepta]
I swear to...
I swear to...
Yeah, I swear to Jesus
I’m a lay her down
