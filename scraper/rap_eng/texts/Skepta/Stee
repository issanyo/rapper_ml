Don’t know me, better get to know me
Give you burns just like its sunny (yo)
But the creativity, with the betta me
Better flow than the fella Kobe
Save a brother like the ay-ay-ay
But his shoes are on layaway
At the Walmart, ain't got shit to say
She slept over, but she shouldn't stay, anyway (yeah)

STEE

I wish they'd arrest my homie
Bad vibes, keep a pocket on me
Is it jealousy? Do you envy me?
Do you want to be
Like a real G
Wild, crazy and free
It's a tough life so remember me
Especially all my enemies

STEE

Gotta keep the weapon on me
Got the spice like a pepperoni
Walk into my great place (cozy)
Don't try to carry me
With your sympathy
You don't know me
So why you telling me
The way its gotta be
You don't know shit
I'm just too good lyrically

On my pokemon shit

Don't fight me over 20 racks really thats sneaker money
Don't fuck around, i won't get your money
Perhaps it's just a fantasy, you and me
Drop a track and blow up like that boy gravy
Say a couple payers like im Farrakhan
Got God on my side, like a catholic preacher
Girl I wanna meet ya
Watch a real man beat ya

STEE

My stee is too good for you
Kill a man, cook him into stew
Cannibalistic, call me sadistic
I’m futuristic, non-realistic
Call me a mystic, artistic
I can see you hopping up onto this dick

STEE

Good stee like a hundred villians
Good stee like a hundred millions
Good stee like my legacy
So what you telling me?
Im the king here, crown me
And my time here is done, so sue me

Block that account it’s a catfish
