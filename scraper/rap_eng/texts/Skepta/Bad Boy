[Pre-Hook]
She told me that I talk nonsense
She said I never boost her confidence
She came home wearing a brand new dress
But I never gave her a compliment
No emotion, no attention
She wants me to pop the question
But I never said a word
Not even a mention

[Hook]
That's why they call me a bad boy
They call me a bad boy
They call me a bad
They call me a bad
They call me a bad
They call me a bad
They call me a bad boy

[Verse 1]
I know she knows, I know she ain't the one
She calls me every name under the sun
Wasteman, lazy
She's mad, she's crazy
She ain't the girl that you wanna lie to
But like a fool one day I still tried to
Like I never forgot your birthday
I was just trying to surprise you

[Pre-Hook]

[Bridge]
That's why they call me a bad boy
They call me a bad boy

[Verse 2]
I know you're buff, I know you're pretty
But listen up, honey, I'm not Billy
You're too deep in love
You need to jump out the water like Free Willy
Cause all you do is just moan and complain
It was all good when your friend came
But any time my friends wanna come around
You start going insane in the membrane

[Pre-Hook]

[Outro]
That's why they call me a bad boy
They call me a bad boy
They call me a bad [x8]
That's why they call me a bad boy
They call me a bad [x8]
That's why they call me a bad boy
