Everybody dance now!

[Verse 1]
Ugh
Black snapback, black beanie
And my chain so bright, they can see me
I do it how they see me do it on the TV
But you’re just ain't looking the same on 3D
You’re living a lie, I’m living a dream
Table full of champagnes, chillin’ with the queen
Razor sharp blade, I’m a guillotine
Soon as I get ahead, I’m bringin’ the team
BBK, I’m bringing the team
Hundred percent UK, we’re killing the scene
Now they hooked on the sound like it’s nicotine
Got their arms stretch out like a limousine
I got my shades on, tell ‘em I still see ‘em
Tell ‘em my haters, I wouldn’t want to beat ‘em
My team’s strong like the bricks in the colliseum

[Hook]
Yeah
So let’s make peace not war
I see girls from all over the world on the floor
Tell the DJ, replay, give me more
(DJ replay give me more)
So let’s make peace not war
I see girls from all over the world on the floor
Tell the DJ, replay, give me more

Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now

It’s cold outside
It’s burning up in the club
I know you’re feeling the heat
I know you feel the love

Everybody dance now

[Verse 2]
Huh
Bad karaoke and good melodies
Bad hangovers and good memories
But right now Ima do it how I say I do it
Ima jump that hurdle when I get to it
I’m looking at her looking at me
I’m the gingerbread man, come and catch me
Talk of the town, you could be my TT
A housemate in my celebrity BB
You’re looking like a star, wheres your manager?
10 out of 10 from the front now back it up
These other guys just ain't just got the stamina
Me, I rock and roll like Noel Gallagher
So why they hatin’ on the king for, huh
So why they hatin’ on the king for
I’m just living my life better live yours

[Hook]
Yeah
So let’s make peace not war
I see girls from all over the world on the floor
Tell the DJ, replay, give me more
(DJ replay give me more)
So let’s make peace not war
I see girls from all over the world on the floor
Tell the DJ, replay, give me more

Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now

It’s cold outside
It’s burning up in the club
I know you’re feeling the heat
I know you feel the love

Everybody dance now
