[Intro: Skepta]
I feel like, at one stage when Giggs came out
It was like, everyone wanted to be a road rapper for a second
You get what I’m saying? I feel like he really changed the mood

But the thing I like about Giggs
Is some people will call him a Grime artist
Like, I’ve seen on my Twitter someone will say
"Oh, my Top Three Grime emcees are Dizzee Rascal, Giggs, and like…"

[Verse 1: Skepta]
S... K... E.PTA
Before I start I just wanna say
Boy Better Know all day
I got bumble bee's tryin’ to figure out how I got this buzz
All I want is a kiss and a hug but somebody told Specsavers I still can't see no love

Days, month, years, blood, sweat, tears
I walk the streets of London facing my fears
And everyday’s like truth or dare
So spin that bottle
‘cause if it lands on me, I'ma stay true to my word
I don't want anymore respect than I deserve

[Bridge: Hattie Collins & Skepta]
I never see you comment on people like Drake

(I used to, I used to
I don’t wanna be up here on some self-righteous shit
I used to, bruv. I was lost, bro
I was in a place, where, I grew up in London
And I was aspiring to America and shit like that
You’re working with the wrong energies, you get what I’m saying?
And ever since I stopped, like that whole of moving
I just started to prosper.)

[Verse 2: Skepta]
No ceilings, no doors, I walk all over the beat, no floors
I tell a hater I love you loads, tell a supporter I love you more
And they say I've changed, I say I'm making a change
I left the road, made a brand new lane
Still I get no thank you, no round of applause
So I keep on driving, I'm upset but I keep on smiling
And when I get knocked down, I get back on my two feet and I keep on fighting
I sacrificed all privacy so I can live my dream what a irony
‘cause now my reality is far from the place I would like to be

[Hook: Agent X]
Well I been breaking it down for you baby
Been running around, I can't see no love for me
Somebody rescue me
I'm the king of the town Mr crazy
Creating the sound, there's still no love for me
Somebody rescue me
Just rescue me

[Outro: Millie Jackson]
And I, don’t love you any longer
Everyday I’m getting stronger
