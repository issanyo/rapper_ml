[Hook: Big H]

Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
It's Big Hooligan (It's Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
It's Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand

[Verse 1: Big H]
Hooligan, Hooligan, combat attack
Hooligan, Hooligan, H is back
Man wanna act like they live in Iraq
16 bars will die on a track
Hooligan, Hooligan, victim attacked
Old school rob man head get whacked
Can't get robbed, can't get jacked
Can't get fired, can't get sacked
That's fantastic, them MCs, they're all plastic
Open the coffin, open the casket
Stupid idiot spastic
Hooligan, Hooligan, H on a set
Hooligan, Hooligan, H is a vet
And I'm always seen as a threat
One of those people, you can't forget

[Hook: Bossman Birdie]

Big Bossman (Big  Bossman)
Big Bossman (Big Bossman)
Skeng in my hand (Skeng in my hand)
I've got the skeng in my hand (Skeng in my hand)
It's Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Skeng in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Big Bossman (Big Bossman)
I've got the skeng in my hand

[Verse 2: Bossman Birdie]

Boss, boss, boss, boss blessed in charge
Hope I've bossed that attempted charge
I'm a full old, you're a little half
Thought they were ready, they ain't half
Can't school me cos you ain't in me class
So far gone, call me the past
Been there, done that, I've bought the mask
I've bought the mask, I've bust that charge
Bossy, I move the grams
Violate me, I'll shoot your gran
When I arrive, call in a hand
Don't want to see me with a big group of man
President, Bossy, Big Hooligan
Been on the road since before your crew began
Stay here thinking you're superman
Bloodline bailiffs will truly bang

[Hook: President T]

T on the wing (T on the wing)
T on the wing (T on the wing)
Kill Off Killy!
That's what I sing
T on the wing (T on the wing)
T on the wing (T on the wing)
Kill Off Killy!
That's what I sing

[Verse 3: President T]

Stranger Returns, I said Stranger Returns
Not just any old stranger, stranger that earns
Lyrically burns
Burying clans, me and H take it in turns
That's what it takes to be first
Guvnor, I can hear deadout lyrics
In this game it often occurs
Prez, you're like Man Utd, Villa and Spurs
Parts of the country, all in one
Why don't you call in son?
Even my neighbour's like,
"Who wants it, anyone? You can bring any stick, any gun
Any blade, any one. Any one, any gun,
Uncle, aunt, any dad, any mum"

[Hook: Big H]

Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
It's Big Hooligan (It's Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
It's Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand (Mic in my hand)
Big Hooligan (Big Hooligan)
Mic in my hand
