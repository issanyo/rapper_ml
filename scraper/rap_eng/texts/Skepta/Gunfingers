[Hook: P Money]
Yo, you might see gunfingers
When I come in the place they're like
Yo, you might see gunfingers
When I come in the place they're like
Tell em' don't go down there
Go round there you'll hear...
Tell em' don't come round ere'
Come round ere' you'll hear...

[Verse 1: P Money]
Yo, you might see gunfingers
When I come in the place like bap bap
Remember those days 20 man in a rave
And another 20 getting through the back back
No one here kicks ball for the England team
But everybody's got caps caps
Some of these bad boys ain't here to rave
You will not find them in no snapchats
Nah but you can find them in the back
Gunfinger left hand right hand yak
Man's on the stage front door's for the yats
Shutdown mode reloads are on tap
Big crowd reaction whenever I chat
Run to the deck, pull it back back
Peak, I don't know why she's on that
I guess P Money's just got it like that cos

[Hook: P Money]
Yo, you might see gunfingers
When I come in the place they're like
Yo, you might see gunfingers
When I come in the place they're like
Tell em' don't go down there
Go round there you'll hear...
Tell em' don't come round ere'
Come round ere' you'll hear...

[Verse 2: Jme]
You might see on my road in a P90
Or leng online with a P90
You could ask P 'bout me
Man get burst like rapid photography
It's mad on stage
Security wanna vibes and rave
Hand on my shoulder, gunfingers on the other hand
And a big smile on their face
Fam, 'llow it, if I ever get
Another touch of the mic then it's curtains
Ah fam, 'llow it, pull up in a Merc
But hop on the mic, you're not merking
Ah fam, 'llow it, man ain't ever gonna
Race certain man and I'm certain
So fam, 'llow it, tell a man already
In the haunted house, it ain't working

[Hook: P Money]
Yo, you might see gunfingers
When I come in the place they're like
Yo, you might see gunfingers
When I come in the place they're like
Tell em' don't go down there
Go round there you'll hear...
Tell em' don't come round ere'
Come round ere' you'll hear...

[Verse 3: Wiley]
Came in the game with a tenner for the subs
Now I'm running the game just like Jay-Z
If you ain't got a real drive or a love for the money
Then I'm sure you're gonna hate me
If I'm in the summer that water, dry mouth
That is gonna dehydrate me
Man wanna control my music career
But none of them man there don't pay me
Jump off a cliff and I land on my feet
Cause I'm busting a cape just like Batman
If yellow dots mean points
Then I'm snapping them up just like Pacman
Living in number 10 Downing Street
You will never see a...
Blud, I eat so much food right now
Should be looking like a...

[Hook: P Money]
Yo, you might see gunfingers
When I come in the place they're like
Yo, you might see gunfingers
When I come in the place they're like
Tell em' don't go down there
Go round there you'll hear...
Tell em' don't come round ere'
Come round ere' you'll hear...
Yo, you might see gunfingers
When I come in the place they're like
Yo, you might see gunfingers
When I come in the place they're like
Tell em' don't go down there
Go round there you'll hear...
Tell em' don't come round ere'
Come round ere' you'll hear...
