[Intro]
Whenever you feel like letting go
And you’ve got your back against the wall
Hold on, hold on
Cause you are undefeatable

[Verse 1]
First place, never settle for less
What’s the point in trying if you ain’t trying your best?
They wanna see me six feet under but I’m watching my steps
Now everybody watching me like Jay Z watches the Nets
Don’t see myself on a skateboard but I stay on my grind
Aiming for the top and I won’t stop till I cross that finish line
I see it like the deaf, I listen like the blind
So if I can’t hear them scheming I still see the signs
I never count the days, I make the days count
They wanna take my crown so I swim when they wanna see me drown
Smile when they wanna see me frown, stand up when they wanna see me down
New and improved attitude, you don’t wanna see me now
They said I can’t do it but I did it
Now they love me all over the world cause they sat my style is so prolific
If I said it I live it, the black Scott Disick
Fresh haircut and a brand new suit, lift up the trophy and kiss it

[Hook]
Whenever you feel like letting go, and you’ve got your back against the wall
Hold on, just hold on
Cause you're gonna take a few low blows, and I know you feel those broken bones
Just hold on, just hold on cause you are undefeatable

[Verse 2]
Tell the papparazi I’m going in tonight
And if anybody wanna stop me, they're gonna need some Kryptonite
I don’t want to sound impolite, but I been sitting here waiting my turn
So if you still don’t know what a boy better know, better watch and learn
I let my left foot rest on the side, only my right foot's touching the pedal
Losing is not an option so I know I’ve got to come with something special
I’m a winner, Jme on my neck, that’s my gold medal
I was underground, now it’s time to take this shit to another level
I never count the days, I make the days count
They wanna take my crown so I swim when they wanna see me drown
Smile when they wanna see me frown, stand up when they wanna see me down
New and improved attitude, you don’t wanna see me now
I got nothing to prove I sit back looking at the game from a bird's eye view then I make my move
Never take my foot off the gas, I’mma go hard till I blow that fuse
Cause the moment you feel like giving up that’s the moment you lose

[Hook]
