[Hook : Wizzy Wow]
Went from a nuttin to a something
Now I'm getting money with my brothers and my cousins
Went from a nuttin to a something
Now I'm getting money with my brothers and my cousins
Selling out shows, getting these O's
I be selling out shows, getting these O's
I be selling out shows, getting these O's
I be selling out shows, getting these O's

[Verse 1 : Skepta]
They say one thing about music
When it hits you feel no pain
But if I make this beat and sing
Something's gonna get stuck in your brain
Haters better get an umbrella
Cause when I'm in the place I make it rain
50 diamonds in my pinky, 1000 diamonds in my chains
It's a public service announcment
Pass me the mic let me do my speech
My mandem know if there's enough to go round
Everybody's gonna get one each
I know you saw us since ...?
Bottles of champagne on the beach
Had to fly back cause I got 10 hours of community service
I don't wanna breach
God gave me a mouth as long as it's working
I'm gonna keep making noise
Cause I'm on the grime scene
Getting black man paper, yeah I got the voice
I could've been dead or in jail
But deep down i know I made the right choice
I never thought I would see so many numbers
On the right side of the decimal point
Major

[Verse 2 : Skepta]
I be selling out shows, getting these O's
Now I'm in a place in the world where
Mandem can't afford to go
I told em how to make it fast
But it's like dem man wanna make it slow
I do it, I didn't wanna do it
Now they wanna try do it but I'm telling them no
Even when I'm in my grave I be getting that money
Hustling in peace
But while I'm alive I be getting that money in north
That money in east
That money in west, that money in south
Got me grinning my teeth
Feel like smoking again so I called Footsie
And got me a bag of grease
Look at all these ladies emergency breaking
So I can feel their bumpers
I'm trynna work out at the iPhone's manager
To remember all these numbers
I think back when I was young
I used to dream about wearing versace jumpers
Now I'm sitting on a tour bus looking
At the que to my show and it's humongous
Skepta!!!
