[Intro: JME]
Oh my days, oh my gosh [x8]

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Here we go again
I got locked up by the po po again
I've been in here since half past ten
It's half past two now when's all this gonna end
I only had one phonecall so I used it
To call my best friend
I told him get all the stuff out the house
Before the po po come searching the prem
The fed keeps looking at me through the flap
Blad, go check somebody else
He took my shoelaces n took my belt
Look we both know there's no way I can hang myself
One minute I saw blue lights
The next minute I'm getting read my rights
Officer the cuffs are way too tight
Your taking the piss out my life
It's a hype

[Hook: Skepta]
When I woke up this morning
I never thought I'd be sitting in a cell
On a blue mat no blanket yawning
Hoping that I get bail
Mum said that I gotta change my ways
But I'm a typical man, wanna be a boss
But then I got shift like oh my days
Now I'm sitting in the cell, like oh my gosh

[Bridge: JME]
Oh my days, oh my gosh [x8]

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Nah, no I don't wanna cup of tea
Just press R-E-C-O-R-D
My name's Joe all I just wanna say N-O
C-O double M E-N-T
Only thing I know about is me
Chat about next man I can't hear or see
Never talk on behalf of my co - d
And I don't want a quiet word with a PC
I don't wanna cigarette no I don't smoke
And I definitely don't wanna bust no joke
I know blacks, but I don't know brown
And I don't like fizzy drinks, I don't know about no coke
One minute I saw blue lights
The next minute I'm getting read my rights
Officer the cuffs are way too tight
You're taking the piss out my life
It's a hype
