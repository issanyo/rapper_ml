[Verse 1: Skepta]
Too many wannabe badboys flexin' like they're so rowdy
Look a badboy straight in the face, tell him I'm a real bad boy, fuck Mike Lowery
I don't take disrespect, neither do the guys that are standing around me
I do it how they didn't wanna do it now they wanna try an do it but I'm telling them 'llow me
When I shut one eye and aim, I hit the target
Ben Cook now sitting at home now try'na work out how he fucked up his artist
If the game was a tray full of ice cubes then I'll be the coldest and the hardest
The last MC that dissed me, blood on the ceiling, blood on the carpet
See I've got more heart than Tony Hawks but when I'm riding, I ain't ramping
I'm ready for all out war, them man are lying on the floor camping
Man in my hood said keep it professional, Skepta, forget the mad ting
I just say Candyman five times in the mirror but nothing ain't happening
When I say that I stick it in the pussy'ole, cuz it ain't no sexual innuendo
I been producing since Mario Paint on the Super Nintendo
So if a man wants to violate me I will make this beat at the fastest tempo
Kill another MC then go Spain and change my name to Lorenzo
There ain't no clowns 'round here, wanna find one, go to the circus
Fuck a suspended sentence, I'll re-offend if I ever get nervous
I say what I mean, mean what I say, so when I say it I'm saying it on purpose
I tell a man that wants to rob me don't bother coming if you ain't got burners
I gave up smoking and then I got stressed out, told KJ get the weed in
Lying in bed paranoid thoughts in my head, staring at the ceiling
100 nightmares in my brain clearly try'na stop me sleeping
1000 diamonds in my chain, and it's hurting a lot of mans feelings
You wanna know why they call me Guy Fawkes in the club, just look at my table
Now they wanna know what Skepta's worth, they wish they knew my appraisal
Black carbon fibre on the roof of the white Audi, I'm so interracial
I start with a little bit of foreplay, have sex, then finish off with a facial
When it comes to the bedroom ladies better know I'm so X-rated
I met her on Monday, made love on the same day cause I ain't Craig David
Big high grade spliff, Courvoursier and Gold, nigga I'm so wasted
I can't drive like this but it's okay cause Jamie's driving a spaceship
Boy Better Know
