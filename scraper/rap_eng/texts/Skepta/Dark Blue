[Hook]
Ride fast in the dark blue
Still hit the gas like I used to
Got a new girl with a new crew
Still fuck with me like she used to
Cause I ride fast in the dark blue
Still hit the gas like I used to
Got a new girl with a new crew
She don't fuck with me like she used to

[Verse 1]
Drinking too much
Fuck around and this my third cup
I got her in her feels
She crying to me trying to tell me that it's real
She know I don't give a fuck
Got so many girls I should have a truck
So I could drop some bitches off
Don't ask me how I got 'em or how it goes

[Hook]
Ride fast in the dark blue
Still hit the gas like I used to
Got a new girl with a new crew
Still fuck with me like she used to
Cause I ride fast in the dark blue
Still hit the gas like I used to
Got a new girl with a new crew
She don't fuck with me like she used to

[Verse 2]
Now tell me what you want
Been giving it to you girl for so long
I'm really tryna fuck
Every time I see you thinking bout us
Like tell me how you feel
Do you want me right now and right here
Cause I give you all I got
Even take some time to stir the pot

[Hook]
Ride fast in the dark blue
Still hit the gas like I used to
Got a new girl with a new crew
Still fuck with me like she used to
Cause I ride fast in the dark blue
Still hit the gas like I used to
Got a new girl with a new crew
She don't fuck with me like she used to

[Outro Hook]
Ride fast, dark blue
Still hit the gas like I used to
Got a new girl with a new crew
Still fuck with me like she used to
Cause I ride fast, I ride fast
Cause I ride fast, I ride fast
Still fuck with me like she used to
Ride fast in the dark blue
New girl, new crew
She don't fuck with me like she used to
