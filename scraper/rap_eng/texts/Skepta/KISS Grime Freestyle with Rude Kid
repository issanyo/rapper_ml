And I can't burn man but the gas can that's CS, now you can't see S
If you wanna VS P, you'll get touched like a Gameboy DS
I, ain't got a BM, but I'll still pipe out your BM
I'll give her the biscuit, BM
I might jump in the war me and myself there's no third eye like Tien
Next one I might lift man out of his TN's, so quick you won't see it
Roll to the rave with no plus 1, still bring three in
See which girls wan pum pum freein', oh yeah
Man can't send for my G's that's a straight up African pair of beatings
Said he's gonna press like apps on an S3, kick in the ballbags, don't get testy
Said he's gonna press like apps on an S3, kick in the ballbags, don't get hold on (testy)
Said he's gonna press like apps on an S3, kick in the ballbags, don't get testy
Said he's gonna press like apps on a hold on (S3), said he's gonna press like apps on a wait
Said he's gonna press like apps on an S3, kick in the ballbags, don't get testy
Got no dough when you're in your twenties
North West don, spent days by the chip shop
Swear them man used to eat Sam's not Wendy's
Gyal with a slim back, chest all hefty
Not wife but you shoulda saw what she sent me
Still peng tings I get plenty
Can't believe them gun chat on a set
Said he shoots like a Lex but he looks like a Lexi
Me nuh inna nuttin' with triangle don but
I'll flatline a man like a set piece
I've got so many levels I move recky
Don't tempt me I'll leave your chest empty
You don't trap you're trendy
Said she wanna eff me as soon as she met me, I was like

Got a new jersey, don't say Dudek

I'll make an MC sweat like shirt, I'll make an MC sweat like his name was Earl
Fuck a sweatshirt call it a crewneck, cah your girl will give the whole crew neck
African Zulu Warrior but you can still get a German Suplex
Royal Rumble I'll be like "who's next", them man are useless, Strally is ruthless
Send an MC to the skies and roof them, roofing MCs like Roofie
MCs get downed like a shot, Strally's got a hangover too then
L Strally's got new flows like Nike, got new creps
But I never went Nike Town, stomping I'll make a MC lie down
On the floor with his back up like iCloud, didn't backup like iCloud
So he got boxed like storage, 123, give man a time-out
Or we can do a countdown, if he was on a TV series with me
Celebrate jungle, get them guys out, come against me that's a Total Wipeout (*Reload*)

Head all bent to the side like D Double E's kangol
You got your body chopped
From the neck to the ankles
You don't want to get every ligament in your body dismantled

Man can get waxed like candles
Different angles, P, tryna get a bank-full
Nah you could never clash I, I

[Lyrical Strally - 28:11]
Yo, yo, it's the um to the voo boo
African Zulu, don't do voodoo
If you want energy, I'm the plug
Call me Lulu, come like a fitness guru
Red devil but I don't bang suwu
Diss man think I won't clock you must've gone cuckoo
Said you must have a screw loose, and your girlfriend's loose too

[PK - 28:25]
I say to myself sometimes "like rah, let me think of another fantastic bar"

[Saint P - 28:38]
Ayy, you must have meant sex in the soil
When you said that you've done'd her
Your girl says that I'm childish, calling me a cunt
But it's all fun, make sure that I beat the cunt first
He said, she said, eff that, bun him, bun her
Kill him with one verse and one herb
My little white girl with the bumper
Thought she can handle the heat now she's sunburnt

[L Strally - 28:52]
Yo, you wanna war with Strally
Salty fish you're not my ackee

Call man Colonel's, you're not Gaddafi
