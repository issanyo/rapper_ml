[Verse 1]
Listen to my emotions I'm letting out
She came in a taxi I'm watching her as shes getting out
It's that pretty face and the sexy body that I'm checking out
And I nearly died when I saw them Ed Hardy shoes stepping out
You know how much work I put into get this princess to my place
We can take It fast take it slow princess this ain't a race
Kiss my neck kiss my chest and kiss below my waist
What happens in the bedroom stays in the bedroom I ain't watching face

[Hook] x8
You're doing a madness to my head

[Verse 2]
I ain't playing with you this ain't no game
We can look at each other in the mirror who said that we can't be vain
Then I turn you round pick you up so you can see my name
I'm looking in your eyes so deep I think I see your brain
Your sexy voice sounds sweet to the ear like a song Bob Marley sang
I wanna throw you in a ring give you a body drop and a power slam
The way I start whistling in the bedroom just call me Macho Man
Or call me Junior call me Joseph or Ed Hardy Dan

[Hook] x8
You're doing a madness to my head

[Verse 3]
We ain't together so there's no breaking up
And it don't look like were gonna argue so there's no making up
I can tell that I'm doing the right thing by the way shes shaking up
And I swear princess if this is a dream then I ain't waking up because...

[Hook] x8
You're doing a madness to my head
