[Pre-Chorus: Murkage Dave]
Bro I got a peng ting in every country
Text her when I land and she come and get me
Driving to the show
Pattern up the week
Blud it’s people like her
I was out in Paris when she came and met me
Took time off of work
Got me cut a spare key
She don’t wear much make-up
But still looks buff
Man it’s people like her

[Chorus: Murkage Dave]
And i’m back to the bits
And i’m back to the ends
Show love to my friends
Put food on the table
And i’m glad that i’m able

And i’m back to the bits
And i’m back to the ends
Show love to my friends
Put food on the table
And i’m glad that i’m able

[Verse 1: Jaykae]
Yeah i’m glad that i’m able
I ain’t gotta shot no abel
I ain’t got signed to a label
I can put food on the table
It was’t always like this i’m praying to day man im grateful
I can catch a flight catch a tan
Just to put a mic in my hand, yo im liking the plan
She wants to see me know we can all to buys on the land
Yeah man do bits
Man make hits
See me on the strip and I wanna take pics
Comin' for the mobos comin' for the brits
And you won’t prospire if you don’t take risks
See me at the studio putting in shifts
Shaking it bits ain’t calling it quits
Yeah I got a family that I provide for
Still tryna' move my mum out the bits

[Post Verse: Jaykae]
Cos' i’m back to the bits
Back to the block
Come a long way from putting cash in my sock
Yeah used to put my money in a shoebox
Now it’s in the bank and they're taxing the lot
Trust me I ain’t gotta graft on the block
Trust me I ain’t gotta do nothing hot
Yeah man I had it on lock before I got locked
Now ave' a look who’s at the top

[Pre-Chorus: Murkage Dave]
Bro I got a peng ting in every country

Driving to the show

Blud it’s people like her

Took time off of work
Got me cut a spare key
She don’t wear much make-up
But still looks buff
Man it’s people like her

[Hook x2: Murkage Dave]
And i’m back to the bits
And i’m back to the ends
Show love to my friends
Put food on the table

[Verse 2: Jaykae]
Yo im glad that ive been through bad times
Look close you can see it in a mans eyes
Blud it made me the man that I am now
You have to deal with things cause thats life
Ya better think twice, can't act twice
Yeah i must have been a don in my past life
Now im throwing down money on my own yard
I ain't in the ends throwin' up gang signs
Yeah trust me i might say bonjour when im on tour
Man a got fly kicks like jean claude
Brum town captin up in this bitch and the flight won't take off till i'm on board
Only got real friends not one fraud
Stand up guy can i get an encore
Am tryna' see things from the top floor
Ain't got no time for one more

[Post Verse: Jaykae]
Cos' i’m back to the bits

Trust me I ain't gotta do nothing hot
Yeah man I had it on lock before I got locked
