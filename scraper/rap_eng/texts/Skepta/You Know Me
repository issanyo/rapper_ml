[Hook]
Chilling in the club minding my own business
Me and my black mates and some white niggers
All of my people in the streets like Mike Skinners
We are spraying champagne looking like winners
Had this Jamaican girl rubbing on my thigh I told her
She's fucking with the greatest rapper alive she gave me the heisman I said I was a pop star
If you know me eh, a wat da bloodclart if you know me eh eh you know me
If you know me eh eh you know me
If you know me eh eh you know me
If you know me eh, a wat da bloodclart
If you know me eh eh you know me
If you know me eh eh you know me
If you know me eh eh you know me
If you know me eh, a wat da bloodclart

[Verse 1]
I walk into the club like I work here
I came fashionably late you were the first here
They say Penn & Teller are making my clothes now
Got my jacket it might disappear if I put it down
Niggers telling me they love the way I put it down
100% UK hit them with the pound
Officer Leng dont wanna see me in town
21st century king sitting with a crown
21st century king sitting on a throne
She gave me brains skeet skeet on the collar bone
When I whisper in her ear do it mono tone
I do it in 3D do it on the phone
I call her wham bam she call me quick ting
She don't even get to see the tattoos on my skin
I pull it out put it on and then I put it in
I pull it out take it off put it in the bin

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Coffee Patrón, tastes so delicious
Got no feeling in my face like Joan Rivers
Devil in my cup praying for forgiveness ..
But don't try this at home this ain't for beginners
It’s a déjà vu I've seen it all before
People on the chairs money on the floor
Bitches on heat 20 on the door
So I don't know what are these niggers are watching me for
Aw, must be the chain it's a mad one
Everybody runs Stewie got a gun said she is ready to go
She wants me to come but I've already beat, give the drummer some
Pull out the stick ram pa pa pam
Now she's blowing on the pipe like it's bubble gum
I got a badder bitch that I've got my eyes on
But the party ain't done until they *turn* the lights on

[Hook]
