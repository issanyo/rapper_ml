[Intro]
Shh hut yuh muh
Joseph Junior Adenuga
Old tight Kane
Skepta on the microphone
Oi Dan Stacey, I know you can see me
Yo

[Verse 1: Skepta]
I used to put 13 scores in my mouth, & start chopping up a next ounce with H
Can't chat to Meridian about weight, u man wouldn’t even know what to do with an 8
You say you’re balling on the 24, you’re still tryna move it on the 8th
Them boys don’t know 'bout Tanitas with the batteries held in with Sellotape
You would’ve thought you were looking at your date of birth when I put my food on the scales
When I get shift I start biting my nails
Never ever been an informer, never told tales
I roll with 4 black males, feds better lock us in separate jails
Dizzee Rascal should’ve phoned my phone 'cause we regulate all the class A sales

[Verse 2: Kano]
My flow’s still big, realness, nigga wheel this, bloodclart track 'cause niggas feel this
No matter how big though niggas will diss, even though I caught this lyric illness
Colder than flu you say you married the game that’s why it sounds like this was borrowed & blue
Mix old & new, make hit minder but one priority that the kids know the truth
They know it's who? K to the fuckin' A with the flow ain't nobody touching
We seen your videos know that you’re nothing, nuff man, champagne, nobody bussin
We locked the game u can't get a touch in, nigga I'm like Mourinho sub him
Track murderer before Rihanna and I made mic check before Santana
Presidential flow, badder than Bush, out with the brap in widda zoop zoop
Fuck boundaries they’re bound to be pushed, the calm before the storm nigga though shush
Shush, it's all so quiet fuck that shit I predict a riot, 'cause I'm still on the grind of writers so ring the alarm the other sound that's dying
I put in my work you're skiving, I chipped in you're still arriving
I'm nice and you're surviving, you ain't sold no record you're lying
And for the record, still got the mixtape shit on lock too and I'm 'pon lock too
That's 21 if you didn't know it, yeah that's 32 & I'm still going
From bar 1 I said reload it but it took 4 bars for you to notice
Hit 8 bars I was like hold this, way too bonkers that's what the flow is
And I never wrote a 16 so quick, 24 more you ain't fuckin' widda team
That's how I know I'm so sick, 40 bars u ain't fuckin' with me

[Verse 3: Ghetts]
I'm analysing the game and its time in a lane, I'm expensive like hiring a plane
I got the fire in my veins, I'm setting the scene alight, no point getting your team to fight
I don't wanna end up getting a 3-5, I ain't letting your team survive niggas ain't threatening me I'm nice
I don't wanna settle the beef I'm hype, on a level I'm T for Strydes
Come widda kettle and heat a guy, so don't fuck widda team you ain't cut for the scene
Duck when I buss, yeah I fuck with machines and the butterfly knife might butterfly guys
Off in the gutter so fuck a nice life so fuck widda team and your mother might die
You ain't a nutter like I, you're a sucker why try

[Verse 4: Skepta]
If you wanna fuck widda team we can Rinse it we can even Heat FM 96.6 it
Oi Maximum don't mix it, I wanna fuck him up so bad not even Jimmy could fix it
Go on then, stir it and whisk it
I start spitting out fire like a .38 biscuit
Dunno why these man are fuckin' widda team when not even Rooney would risk it
Go on then spit a 32 bar lyric, I'll rustle up an 8 bar lyric, to dun your lyric
If it's a lyrical war then I'm in it
After I win it, lift up the trophy & kiss it
Anytime you want a rematch come to the studio opposite Dexplicit
Don't wanna fuck widda team don't give it
I'll make the biggest mic man look like a midget

[Hook: Scorcher, Wiley, Ghetts, Skepta]
Don't get big for your boots and come with a clique full of youts
Man I'll roll up pistols and shoot and then start (Fuckin' widda team)
I can hear him still I don't fear him, I'm standing near him Wiley's with Sheeren it don't make sense him (Fuckin' widda team)
Ever since I was a kid kid kid I'll flip the script prick how a ninja would slip in the bits there's no way you're (Fuckin' widda team)
And it's Skepta, pardon my language but this guy needs to eat one pussyclart gunshot sandwich, why is he (Fuckin' widda team)

[Verse 5: Scorcher]
What so what, you wanna fuck widda team then buck your machine 'cause if i see you on a normal day man
I'll cut thru the jumper and jeans and dig out a lump of your spleen in front of your team
I ain't gotta buck widda bean, I got a flick knife I'll stick guys
When you let off your .38 six times and hit nothing
I'll spin back around and cut through six guys
I've done this once before, I've been involved in guns & war
So listen to K don't fuck widda team, 'cause I'm so sure i'll buck the 4
And let off the pistol in broad daylight when it's crystal like I'm above the law
So go ahead start (Fuckin' widda team)

[Verse 6: Wiley]
Yo, forget fuckin' widda team, don't chuck it widda team
I'm too big, they can't lock him in the scene
I won't get bumped, try knock him in the scene
Think the kid's off guard, lean on green
I'm so controversial, strong not weak so its on, who's on?
The remix that u try and make a better tune in
I'm superhuman, think that I'm a loser
You keep fuckin' widda team then you're gonna be the human losing
I'm an intruder, I'm intruding
When nIggas came to the game I was moving
6 years later Wiley's still moving
Tell me who's weighty, wanna out date me?
When I'm on form no top boy's cruising
See a spot in the ranks and you move in, me I got a spot in the ranks I ain't moving

[Hook: Scorcher, Wiley, Ghetts, Skepta]
Don't get big for your boots and come with a clique full of youts
Man I'll roll up pistols and shoot and then start (Fuckin' widda team)
I can hear him still I don't fear him, I'm standing near him Wiley's with Sheeren it don't make sense him (Fuckin' widda team)
Ever since I was a kid kid kid I'll flip the script prick how a ninja would slip in the bits there's no way you're (Fuckin' widda team)
And it's Skepta, pardon my language but this guy needs to eat one pussyclart gunshot sandwich, why is he (Fuckin' widda team)

[Outro]
(Fuckin' widda team)
