(Intro: Skepta)
G-r-r-r-eease

(Hook: Lancey Foux)
Duckin' from the menacin'
Somethin' in me boostin' my adrenaline
Got a devil at my door can't let him in
Got the world in my hand my fingers pedellin' Medellín
When I walk in these girls gonna compete like it's a pageant
The ADHD whip the engine throwin' a tantrum
Duckin' from the menacin'
Somethin' in me boostin' my adrenaline

(1st Verse: Lancey Foux)
Electric
Took a right, cause I saw the stop check
I'm ready to die but I ain't no tourist just yet
Hot pink I dyed already and braided myself at the front
I was born in '95 see in my coupe Jacksonville loft
Forever money in my book I got a knot in my cloth
We didn't listen to navigation we at north getting lost
Hmm..life is a game I think Skep is the final boss
I was afraid of the pain but the changes made me strong

(Hook: Lancey Foux)
Duckin' from the menacin'
Somethin' in me boostin' my adrenaline
Got a devil at my door can't let him in
Got the world in my hand my fingers pedellin' Medellín
When I walk in these girls gonna compete like it's a pageant
The ADHD whip the engine throwin' a tantrum
Duckin' from the menacin'
Somethin' in me boostin' my adrenaline

(2nd Verse: Skepta)
True stories
I was trapped in a trap house
I think I just saw a mouse (huh?)
And I fell asleep with the scores in my mouth (what?!)
And of course I'm spitting crack what you talkin' about (shine!)
Mr. Adenuga I was born with the clout
Bloody walk any time I'm steppin' out
Money talks runnin' up and I'm gettin' down
I was just talking to this model and she says she's reppin south
Me? Reppin north
She wanna kiss me she wanna fuck me in the Porsche
I told her you're gonna miss me better keep me in your thoughts
I left my ex cause I ain't really into loss (wow)
Skinny legs I ain't really into shorts
I step in the party see the swag they feel the force (bow!)
Told the fake ballers me and Lancey on the court (g-r-r-ee!)
The feds looking for me I tell 'em follow the sauce

(Hook: Lancey Foux)
Duckin' from the menacin'

When I walk in these girls gonna compete like it's a pageant
The ADHD whip the engine throwin' a tantrum
Duckin' from the menacin'
Somethin' in me boostin' my adrenaline
