[Intro: Frisco]
"Yo, yo, Big Fris"
And everyone keeps on asking me "what happened in Napa bruv man, ahh I heard you man were in dramas over there what happened? I was hearing all sorts bruv I'm hearing it weren't anything good"
Well you know what I'm just gonna lay it down now innit and let you know what really happened
Yeah it weren't good man it weren't good man trust me
If you ever go abroad, just know yourself

[Verse 1: Frisco]
Everybody keeps asking "what happened in Napa?"
So I'm gonna break down what happened in Naps
Imma draw the picture but not with a pencil
It was me, Skeps, Jabo and Denzel
Jme and Maximum
Who was in club Ice and the vibes were nice
We had bags of 'em
Bottles of Sambuca and Henny
Came through smacked up the dance on a [?]
Now I'm outside back 'cus I can't find Skeppy
And one pricks on his squad
Riding up and down infront of guy showing off
Throwing on big like his name was Boss
Nearly hit my bike so I told him to mind out
That's when I got to find out
This guy must be mad and he thinks that he's bad
He started to get hype and wile out

[Bridge 1: Skepta, [?]]
Oi Skepta man I swear Frisco's trying to move to that guy man
[?], oi Parky's an eediat bruv
Oi can we stamp him out man, fuck the long ting blud man
Nah man he's an eediat don't watch that I ain't fighting him bruv
He's got a little chap still, I I will take dat blud

[Verse 2: Frisco]
So I parked up the ped
Analyse the situation and get things clear in my head
I don't wanna see nobodies blood shed but my man deserves a pump in his head
So I'm like "rudeboy look, hear what I'm saying, I'm not here for the war but, mind what you're saying"
Then he said, "rudeboy I don't care what you're saying, I'm here I ain't going nowhere I'm staying"
"So you're a badboy alright then"
"Blud I don't care where you're from I don't care what you're on where I come from, I'll tump up man then I'm gone"
Told him to suck out his mum no long
Then from behind he tried to take a cheap shot blow
Hurry up hid with the big shot
Now it's all long 'cus your nose is broken, soaked in blood with your face all open

[Bridge 2: Frisco, Skepta]
See, that's what happens blud
Suck your mum
Oi blud can we get out of here (fucking pussy), oi Skepta get off him now get off him
Oi he's got Chaps, I'm gonna I'm taking his Chaps, nah fuck that fuck that
Oi [?] let's get out of here man

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Should've got a couple slaps
I dunno what made me take his Chaps
Next time I'll drink a soft drink instead 'cus the Hennessy and Sambuca go straight to my head
I went jail
Thought I was dead
Cockroaches walking on my bed
I was paying for a parked off ped
Boy better know I'm lucky to get bail
I was looking at a 3 year sentence in jail
24 hour banger, never got mail
I was munching tuna, cucumber and tomato
Mini wrap mini cater like Desperado
Big up Saskilla and Boya
Hold tight Frisco's lawyer
We can't go jail, we're the kings of grime
That's how it's gonna be for a very long time
'Cause we go to the rave, get a rewind and the second line never sounded like the first line
Nasa

[Bridge 3: Frisco]
Trust me
And now it's long cah
Man gets shift the next day you get me
Now man's in jail like
On robbery and GBH charges it's mad
One minute, man's riding up and down on peds, living it large
Now I'm in jail bruv
And you know what the worst ting is?
Guess who I buck up in there bruv
Ahh it's mad
Oi Trim man what happened man
Ahh fuck

[Verse 4: Trim]
Yo let me tell you the lowdown again
See Flowdan and dem?
I'm on a different program to dem
So when Marcus is shouting "Roll Deep smokes pengï»¿"
I'm on a ting where I'm shouting suck your mum times 10
Yeah, suck your mum times 10
If girls love N.A.S.T.Y, they have to love Trim and Johnny Skeng
But anyway, we're in Aiya Napa Greece
And Marcus' baby mum is from the ends
Their crews dead out we're not friends
We ain't even [?]
AB's already put Marcus in a headlock
Tried to pop his eye out of his head
And I'm hearing Fris, Jaybo and Skepta are in pen
Rico lost some P's in the airport so he ain't on this ting again
And then there was 6, plus Rico's friend
And I say Rico's friend 'cause if Kerry was on the back of Rico's ped instead of Scratchy's
He might not have looked into thin air when it was time to back it
Now I got man at my door chatting shit
Like Scratchy been stabbed and we don't know where he is
So I'm like [?], let's try and find Scratch and this Marcus prick
But we went down to that side, guess who I see?
Who? His missus
Who was targeting Danny Weed
Before I could speak, I'm hearing "we're trying to sort it, keep him away from me"
I'm like where's Scratchy D

[Outro: Trim, Frisco]
Actually don't even answer
Listen
Bare things are gonna on right now
It's..it's still last night as well
Everyone's drunk, it's a hype
Everyone's outside the hotel
It's a bagga noise
There's an audience
I just got caught up in it, quickly
Ahhh she was in my face for ages, I...couldn't hold back no longer
But yeah man, they got me chiffed
Marcus and his missus, they got me arrested
My passport got took off of me because of them
Fucking cunt
I'll catch you, watch
Pussy
Suck something
But yeah
Man not in Aiya Napa now whilst everyone's going home
10 weeks down the line
I'm still trying to get my passport back
Charges were...punched...girl in the face
That's all I could understand more time
"You hit girl"
She's from the ends, she speaks Greek, so I got chiffed
Me and Frisc
Ah fam, long ting
Trust me
It's long fam
Alright this ain't the place to be man, trust me
When you go on holiday you need to know yourself though trust me, you do
You get me like, liqueur will go to your head and make you do some stuff but, you get me
Just hold it down man cah, you will end up, in the bin
You get me?
So now man go court, you get me?
Man catch a squeeze, man get a fine, you get me?
Man's outta there now bruv
And man don't wanna go through it again fam so
You have to learn your lessons you get me
Big up Skepta big up J World big up Trim
You get me?
Yeah man, 2006
