[Intro]
Skepta, Microphone champion
This ain't no subliminal, it's a statement
King of Grime

[Verse 1]
Some mannas don't like me cause I say I'm the king of grime
But time after time I show man I will never let no man diss the program
Over and over again I prove that any radio-show, any DVD, any stage-show man
Put me up against gimmicks, sound effects or skippy flow man
Don't think that you're cold, cause you're not ready for the snow man
You don't want drama trust me I can get hot like lava
So on point in the war, government wanna find out if I've been chatting to Osama
Skepta the K I N G man's start panicking when I MC
Yeah, J A rules, but it's Boy Better Know, it's not Murder I N C

[Hook]
WOW, I'm the king of grime and I will be for a very long time
Cause I go to the rave get a rewind and the second line never sounded like the first line
WOW, I'm the king of grime and I will be for a very long time
Cause I go to the rave get a rewind and the second line never sounded like the first line

[Verse 2]
Now I don't MC I just think out loud
But you can call me MC of all time
Better still call me the king of grime
Better still call me licence to kill
Promoters are booking you man for a bill
I get a G, still I ain't had one deal
I get to the rave within the first five minutes
I already get one wheel
Then I get two wheels it's a bicycle
Then I get three wheels it's a tricycle
Then I get four wheels it's a car, you can't even get a unicycle
It's a par, so you better stop spitting
Forget a freestyle, man I spit a pre-written
You listening to the best spitter in Britain
I repeat, best spitter in Britain

[Hook]
WOW, I'm the king of grime and I will be for a very long time
Cause I go to the rave get a rewind and the second line never sounded like the first line
WOW, I'm the king of grime and I will be for a very long time
Cause I go to the rave get a rewind and the second line never sounded like the first line

[Verse 3]
So which one of you lot wanna wanna run up in a war
That you're not ready for
I killed eight man, I wanna bury more
We can do it in a Sidewinder, Eskimo or Rinse
I am the king you're not even a prince
I told him to put a little gum on his tongue to test it
But he put the whole eighth on, I think that's why he's been lean ever since
I think that's why his live show is a shambles
Don't wear shorts if you got dry ankles
Don't take pics if you got dry lips
I thought that you knew that
You can't do that
Like trying to put custard on chips
I've been killing MCs
Before I started watching ninja man YouTube clips
I'm ready for the war like Bloods and Crips

[Hook][x2]
WOW, I'm the king of grime and I will be for a very long time
Cause I go to the rave get a rewind and the second line never sounded like the first line
WOW, I'm the king of grime and I will be for a very long time
Cause I go to the rave get a rewind and the second line never sounded like the first line

[Outro]
Wow
Skepta, Microphone Champion
The King of Grime
Grime
That's how the cookie crumbles in Grime
That's how the cookie crumbles in Grime
