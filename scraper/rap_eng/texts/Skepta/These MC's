[Intro - Kano]

I'm kicking back sipping my brandy and Baileys
On fire like Weezy F daily
Touch mic no if, buts or maybes
(Boy Better Know)
Make the fucking crowd go crazy

[Verse 1 - Kano]

Look at my face, am I bothered?
Spray so fucked I'm just being honest
I don't even wanna speak on it but before you say my name, sleep on it
I be in the dance with class, drink my own drink, wear my own garms
Party like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
That's a real rockstar

[Hook]
(Skepta)
Them boys ain't bad like me, I got my flow locked down to a T
Take a little look around and you'll see that a lot these MC's can't MC
(Kano)
Yeah, yeah them boys can't bad like me, from the USA back to London T
Turn on the TV and you'll see that a lot of these MC's can't MC

[Bridge - Kano]

I check the radio and all I hear is loads of little yout' MC's over the microphone
They ain't built like me, they carry lyric books but they can't MC

[Verse 2 - Kano]

When I hit the road I get the show, so live-o when I spit the flow
I'm in the zone, deeper lyrics one four zero beats per minute
Them boy can't bad like I, lyric dem a fly high high to the sky
Don't be surprised when you ask me the price 'cause I'm extortionate like Toni & Guy
Them boy can't good like we, Boy Better Know it's the boys let alone
They flow straight, touch mic and set a tone
It's K-A, honey I'm home
I do my ting get the money and go
Never see them look bummy and broke
Them can't look nice like we cause a lot of these MC's can't MC

[Hook]
(Skepta)
Them boys ain't bad like me, I got my flow locked down to a T
Take a little look around and you'll see that a lot these MC's can't MC
(Kano)
Yeah, yeah them boys can't bad like me, from the USA back to London T
Turn on the TV and you'll see that a lot of these MC's can't MC

[Verse 3 - Skepta]
(Boy Better Know)
They ain't ready for this combination, we're suttin like Freddy and Jason
Better still he's Kano, so today I'm Raiden
You can never clash me with a brain the same size as a raisin
And if you can't MC, produce and mix.. Then I don't wanna hear your name in the king of grime conversation
You can't catch me I'm too quick off the mark
Think that I'm speaking for both of us when I say Lord Of The Mics was a walk in the park
Performing used to be a skill now I call it an art
Yeah we run London town, when I pick up the mic I bun London down
Promoters pay me half of the door money, them man are getting booked for a hundred pound

[Hook]
(Skepta)
Them boys ain't bad like me, I got my flow locked down to a T
