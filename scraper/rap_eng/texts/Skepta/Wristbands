[Verse 1: Bossman Birdie]
Bossman
They don't want beef, they want horse
All that bad boy talk is false
Mention trap life in them bars
Believe that I am the source
Used to run these streets with heat
No I ain't talking 'bout Olympic torch
These MC's all think they're live
Then I come through and make everyone a corpse
They don't want beef, nah they want peace
Man better pray to the Jesus piece
Before you mention me in a verse
I beg you order the wreath
Order the church
I'm telling you order the priest
I didn't come here to cause no grief
But I will make your whole team grieve

[Hook: Skepta, (Bossman Birdie) & Meridian Dan] (x2)
Got G's in Junction been showing me love before I had my deal
(Got a mate in Hackney that'll ride for me and he won't even ask for a bill)
Fam I got a sexy ting that lives on an estate in Brixton Hill
100 wristbands around my wrist, I go anywhere I feel

[Verse 2: Meridian Dan]
Got brothers on the road and they're not from my mum
But family, I got bare brothers
You tell me, do I look like a mad man?
I know so much man that are nutters
I'm living in London and all of the real dons know that I keep it trill
Come through big, R6 one wheel
The young youths call me the big man still
And back in the war field, I did a marathon
Man talk high so I let them carry on
Man can't roll with a tag-along
They talk hype then run to the Babylon
100 wristbands around the wrist
Hundred dons from around the bits
Grew up with grime now I wanna know glitz
I know too many man that are skitz

[Verse 3: Skepta]
Let me school this child
I was on the roadside putting in miles
Still on the roadside putting in miles
On your block in a new car, whippin' in style
Don't ask me what I'm doing round 'ere
With your bad breath, what you chewing round here? (wow)
If you don't wanna get a slap, you better talk to your boss
And mind who you're screwing round here (i-i-ice)
God knows I don't wanna switch
But he invented so many pricks
Look into my eyes, you know what it is
I'm not a target, bill your spliff
And tell Michelle that I'm sitting outside (sex)
Move to the side of the ride
We're not called Boy Better Know no more
We're called Everybody Better Know Worldwide

[Outro]
100 wristbands around my wrist, I go anywhere I feel
100 wristbands around my wrist, I go anywhere I feel
100 wristbands around my wrist, I go anywhere I feel
100 wristbands around my wrist, I go anywhere I feel
