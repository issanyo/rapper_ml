[Verse 1: Skepta]
Is it the champagne dance (No)
This is the champagne talk
Pop goes the cork the champagne pours
Stop hold the thought wait pause
I see a girl in the distance making me weak like a premature infant
If she ever knew how much I wanna get my hands on her she would have thought I was O.J. Simpson
But I gotta take my time (yes) fink of the perfect rhyme
At the same time I don't wanna loose this race cause I see a lot of man on the startin line
Wanna be the first man on the finishin line
But you know what she's so hot I'll be more than happy to take it s-slow cause

[Hook: Jay Sean]
I'm not in a rush rush rush rush
Cause she lookin so lush lush slow down
I'm not in a rush rush rush rush
Cause she lookin so lush lush so slow it down. I'm not in a rush

[Verse 2: Skepta]
This ain't the drink talkin here
But ever since I walked in here I've been investigating you like inspector Morse in here
Your the kind of girl I would wife got me thinkin what the babies would look like
Then a think twice like slow down Joseph what I really wanna know is
1. what you drinkin?
2. what you thinkin?
3. who you linkin?
Cause I hope he's not here that's a beautiful face you got there
And you know what your so hot I'll be more than happy to take it s-slow cause

[Extended Hook: Jay Sean]
I'm not in a rush, rush, rush, rush
Cause she lookin so lush, lush, s-slow down
I'm not in a rush, rush, rush, rush
Cause she lookin so lush, lush, so slow it down
I'm not in a rush rush, rush, rush
Cause she lookin so lush, lush, s-slow down
I'm not in a rush, rush, rush, rush
Cause she lookin so lush, lush, so slow it down
I'm not in a rush, I'm not in a rush
I'm not in a rush, rush, rush, rush
(Baby, slow down)
Cause she lookin so lush, lush, s-slow down
(You're so fine)
I'm not in a rush, rush, rush, rush
(Baby, I'm not in a rush)
Cause she lookin so lush, lush, so slow it down (Oh!)
I'm not in a rush, rush, rush, rush
(Cause, girl, you're looking so damn fine)
Cause she lookin so lush, lush, s-slow down
(Can we just take our time?)
I'm not in a rush, rush, rush, rush
(We ain't gotta go nowhere)
Cause she lookin so lush, lush, so slow it down
I'm not in a rush
