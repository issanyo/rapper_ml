[Intro]
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, Skepta, violets are blue
I wear my sunglasses at night
And girl better know, I got my eyes on you
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you

[Verse]
I wear my own glasses
Man see me outside I want passes
But if your name ain't down
You ain't coming in
There's no two ways about it (nah)
Roses are red, violets are blue
Can you see me? Cause I can see you
I don't want a table, look at the view
It's my party look at the queue
Put your sunglasses on
Dance with me to my sunglasses song
I'm too extra, girls say Skepta
Tell me where you get your glasses from, please?
Gabby knows [?], Gabby knows me
Pull up outside with JME
A T-I-P for the VIP
Cause we ain't leaving till half past three

[Hook x4]
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you

I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you

Can't see
Can't see anything
Can't see a thing

I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you
I wear my sunglasses at night
Roses are red, violets are blue
You know I got my eyes on you
