[Verse 1: Flowdan]
Yo, flowing pon microphone is a minor

But likkle soundboy nuh ah go like this one

[Chorus: Nasty Jack]
The badboy's in town, the big money sound
In a soundclash we leave duppies flying around
The badboy's in town, the big money sound
In a soundclash we leave duppies flying around

[Verse 2: Teddy Bruckshot]
Yo, if me go ah dance, it ain't nuttin' but hypeness
Lyric dem me start got big tings and priceless
No nyam pork cuh you know say me righteous
Bwoy cyaan chat to me cuh me fearless
Say you have a gun but me couldn't care less
Cuh when me go ah dance, me have me ratchet and piere cess
Piere high grade, that's for relieving piere stress
Piere gyal me have so you know me have piere sex
Used to go bun down Stourbridge Complex
Been around since you heard [?]
When you first heard Sky just play two decks
Murder soundboy so tell me who's next
Strictly dubplate, me nuh mek no test press
If me eat food then me go down the West Best
That's just the way Teddy Bruckshot will flex
Bun soundboy and leave them to rest

[Chorus: Nasty Jack]
The badboy's in town, the big money sound
In a soundclash we leave duppies flying around
The badboy's in town, the big money sound
In a soundclash we leave duppies flying around

[Verse 3: Skepta]
They wanna run it up, but like Armour said
It's nothing, leave them
Bare skeng talk, I can't believe them
Red and white R6, leave them
D&G glasses, I can't see them
Why you talking like you can't die?
One bullet in each lung, breathe them
You see, you're sounding wheezy
You see, I heard your CD
You and your mandem are talking greazy
I just tell a man like D-E-E
"Come on, come on"
Do you really think
I give two shits if you're greazy?
I don't think so
You man ain't seen greazy yet
When my mandem pop it off
Your marrow will fly
Into the sky like EasyJet

[Chorus: Nasty Jack]
The badboy's in town, the big money sound
In a soundclash we leave duppies flying around
The badboy's in town, the big money sound
In a soundclash we leave duppies flying around

[Verse 4: Nasty Jack]
In a soundclash, fassyhole, me run that
Any sound system test, me dun dat
Anytime me come stage show, me bun that
On microphone like dat ah me gun dat
Shadow Demon, dem ah call me Black Cat
Semi-automatical flows, me strap dat
And me buss me ting for sure, me MAC that
Let off some bloodclart bomb like Baghdad
Give dem thump and kick like Van Damme
Jack Nasty, you know me roll with badman
I will light dem up and gas man
Bun up the fassy, they can't clash man
Jack man, you don't wana get me mad, man
Come to the dance on my own with mash, man
Light up the dance, me have fight fi cash, man
After the clash, dem ah call it ash, man

[Chorus: Nasty Jack]
The badboy's in town, the big money sound
In a soundclash we leave duppies flying around
The badboy's in town, the big money sound
In a soundclash we leave duppies flying around
