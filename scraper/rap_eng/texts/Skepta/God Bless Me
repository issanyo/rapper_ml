[Verse 1: Wiki]
Most of your girls don't get me
But the ones that do they don't forget me
I become they world and they let me
Do whatever, rather kiss but the booty rather tempting
I gotta get it girl now there's loogies on the bed sheet
You know that your a beauty, only thing that stress me
Got a perfect smile but it ain't looking too good empty
Trying to impress me to F me
And I'll impress you, and F you
Sit up on my face put that pussy on a pedestal

[Hook: Wiki]
As you can see god bless me
When I cop tree, the god bless me
When I sneeze god bless me
Make em say cheese, I'm next B
As you can see god bless me
When I cop tree god bless me
When I smoke tree god bless me
When I sneeze god bless me
(I don't understand)

[Verse 2: Sporting Life]
As you can see, god bless me
With ability to use a S.P
Now I'm nominated for a ESPY
Still I feel some people don't get me
When I'm out in London know they get me
Why you looking crunchy?, call you Nestl√©
I was walking to the deli when she met me
Imma send her to the deli when she bless me
But don't stress me, I bless you
I be dropping jewels, have you finish all your vegetables
30 thousand feet god damn that's incredible
Hope I'm blessed with some food that is edible
Before I eat I count my blessings

[Verse 3:  Skepta]
You see the devil tried to get me
Tried to push my buttons, tried to press me
Tried to catch me with a blade but I ain't Wesley
As you can see, the god bless me
No Pepsi, no Coca Cola in my Hennessy
Man in Tennessee and Oklahoma, yeah, they're reppin' me
Wiki, I'm in Chinatown, come and get me
Let's go uptown, them Spanish tings are kinda sexy
Skeppy, I'mma pull to your house
With my weed concealed, ringing off the bell
On the couch, told her keep it real
Man don't kiss and tell
In her mouth, now she's telling man
That she knows my peoples
I said wow, don't say tings like that
You know that's illegal
She don't get me
They don't forget me
They really tried to bet me
I put 100 on it, don't upset me, aye

[Verse 4:  Wiki]
I'm gonna lick her, sip fifths of the liquor
It make me shiver, but my chest stick don't impress her
She rub it in, she love the texture, leave me on a stretcher
After she dome me then she hold me down through all the pressure
And I protect her ya'll ain't even know the measures
That I will go I climb a mountain just to know she better
But that's whatever, dick her down, get my bread up
But most times I'm feeling blessed up
Not to mentioned,  got alot of tree right on the dresser
She roll it up for me, you know that she got love for me
You know that she got love for me
She roll it up for me, you know that she got love for me
