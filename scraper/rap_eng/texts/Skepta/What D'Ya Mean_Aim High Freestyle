[Intro]
Yeah, I'm gunna speak on Merrick's behalf
Murder charge ain't a joke and laugh
You think that you're shower but you can't even jump in the bath
I know the skengman that do obeah, voodoo and witchcraft
Roll with a 9 month old baby so they can bring out the mash in a Winnie da Pooh scarf

Aim High business, Skepta
Big up Target
Aim High 3
Nothing long
I say what I want, do what I want
Don't chat to me
Shut your mouth

[Verse 1]
My bredrin got the connect to the MAC
The connects' talking a thousand 3
I'm just about two bills short of a g
Couple more big PAs and hopefully that's me
Wait hold on let me see
I could do something smart with the P
Might buy 7 8 balls of the B
Flip that and buy a brand new TT
Then I might sign up to the gym because I've heard man are
Looking for me and my mates
After I'm done pumping the weights
Gonna buy a stab-proof vest and put in the plates
I've got so many stars and stripes man, I'm looking to move to the states
Every complement my head inflates
Yeah I Roll Deep but I don't wear skates

[Hook]
What d'y mean, what d'y mean, what d'y mean, what d'y mean, you fool
Go on then, go on then, draw for the tool
Think that you're hard but you're soft like wool
Lick a man in the jaw side with a stool
I'm a real bad man but I still look cool
White gold chain and an iced out jewel
But they couldn't jack me because I'm not Ja Rule
Nah rude boy what d'ya mean, what d'ya mean?

[Verse 2]
Yo, keep dissing me, Richard and Javan
Really and truly that was the whole plan
Knew if I dissed one man, I will get your whole crew, saying my whole name while I finish the album
So now I owe you one that's a third of my adverting done
But I heard a couple man dissing my Mum, so God forgive me if I bust my gun
God forgive me if I bust my 9
God forgive me if I bust my 9
I don't want to get locked up like Shyne
If you diss my Mum then you crossed my line
God forgive me if I bust my 9
God forgive me if I bust my 9
I don't want to get locked up like Shyne
But if you diss my Mum then you know [?]

[Hook]
What d'y mean, what d'y mean, what d'y mean, what d'y mean, you fool
Go on then, go on then, draw for the tool
Think that you're hard but you're soft like wool
Lick a man in the jaw side with a stool
I'm a real bad man but I still look cool
White gold chain and an iced out jewel
But they can't jack me because I'm not Ja Rule
Nah rude boy what d'ya mean, what d'ya mean?

What d'y mean, what d'y mean, what d'y mean, what d'y mean, you fool
Go on then, go on then, draw for the tool
Think that you're hard but you're soft like wool
Lick a man in the jaw side with a stool
I'm a real bad man but I still look cool
White gold chain and an iced out jewel
But they can't jack me because I'm not Ja Rule
Nah rude boy what d'ya mean?
