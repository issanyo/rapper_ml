[Verse 1]
You can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread man
Rolling with a mic in my left hand
Diss me, you're a walking dead man
Could have been Bruce Lee, could have been Jackie Chan
I'm Karate Kid, send for the head band
This year I'm not playing with a man
Pause, I'm not staying with a man, I'm gone
I'm not spraying with a man that's never produced a beat, never had decks
Chatting 'bout I'm not the king of the flex
It's like them man are so obsessed
Watching me like I'm wearing a pink dress
I'm Bowser, them man are like Princess
Stole my flow, but they won't confess
Everything cool though blud, no stress
But next time you're looking at your PRS
Just know

[Hook]
You're never gonna be like Skepta
Nobody ain't matching me
You're never gonna be like Skepta
Nobody ain't matching me
Ner ner ner ner ner, ner ner ner ner ner
Ner ner ner ner ner, ner ner ner ner ner

[Verse 2]
Yo, they said I've got a basic flow
No, I've got an amazing show
Halifax know that I'm making dough
Changing money, Gatwick and Heathrow
Black rims on the white 350
When I drive over the bumps, I've gotta go slow
Cause my car's way too low
Try take mine and the gunshots blow
You said you was ready for the war
When it kicked off, you were standing where the feds were
No fed can make me say "yes sir"
I rep Boy Better Know and I ain't looking for a transfer
You thought you was on a hype ting?
You ain't met my little bro killer here
Like my older bro Ky I'm a ninja
Skepta, Boy Better Know entrepreneur

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So which one of you lot wanna get burned like the bottom of the soup pot
Like Jermaine Neblett I'm too hot
See the arms race, boy over there with the gloves on
He's rolling with a Bulldog
So keep thinking that my crew's soft
It's my house, take your shoes off
[?] when I'm moving, just move off
Rudeboy come out the yard
Skepta, I can't run out of bars
And if sky's the limit, I'm heading for the stars
Back to the future, spaceship cars
Now all the family's eating
I won't sign another deal so fast
Man are looking for the big boy contract
Them man are happy with five day pass

[Hook x2]
