[Hook: Frisco]
My girlfriend's getting on my nerves
The arguments are hurting my head
So I ring up the mandem ASAP
Cause I heard there's a rave in west
Raving tonight, man's raving tonight
Raving tonight, I'm going raving tonight
Raving tonight, man's raving tonight
Raving tonight, I'm going raving tonight

[Verse 1: Frisco]
Yo
I tell my girl straight like Kendrick
Please stop killing my vibe off
Right now I've got the type of domestics
I will jump in my car then drive off
I'm not saying I wanna take time off
I've never been a stranger to hard work
But you're getting on my last nerve
You wanna argue with me cuh you can't get the last word?
That's so dead
Best ting I fall back instead
I don't want to say something I'll later regret
So I put on my chain and my crep and I'm gone again
The arguments are making me vexed
You carry on when it's done like a outtake
Now I'm out frass in a house rave
This one night you pissed me off
So I ain't coming home til I see sunlight

[Hook: Frisco] (x2)
My girlfriend's getting on my nerves
The arguments are hurting my head
So I ring up the mandem ASAP
Cause I heard there's a rave in west
Raving tonight, man's raving tonight
Raving tonight, I'm going raving tonight
Raving tonight, man's raving tonight
Raving tonight, I'm going raving tonight

[Verse 2: Skepta]
I don't know if it's something I did
I don't know if it's something I said
But this girl is like a shit barber
Always trying to fuck with my head
I told her to leave it and put the problems under the bed
Keep the shouting levels under the red
But she don't want to hear so the next name I call her ain't going to be one to forget
Get dressed, call Shorty
Phone EZ, pick up my door key
Or the next time any of my niggas see me
I'll be sitting on the stage with Maury
Now I'm in the VIP with a band on my wrist
Popping a bottle of Cris
Want to know what I'm celebrating? I'll tell them this
I'm on my 'hate my girlfriend' shit

[Hook: Frisco] (x2)
My girlfriend's getting on my nerves
The arguments are hurting my head
So I ring up the mandem ASAP
Cause I heard there's a rave in west
Raving tonight, man's raving tonight
Raving tonight, I'm going raving tonight
Raving tonight, man's raving tonight
Raving tonight, I'm going raving tonight

[Verse 3: Wiley]
If I walk out now like I wanna do
The argument won't be over
But I can't take it so I pick up my keys
And put my coat over my shoulder
When me and her clash in the hallway
We'll say enough stuff to last us all day
But not this time, I'm switching off
Turn the bitching off, that's it, I'm slipping off
Then I switch back into my night
Cause her right ain't the same as my right
And we can be wrong but it won't get solved
Before I hit the bar and take flight
She's still in my mind, I'm an idiot though
Cause I got gyal in the dark peeping though
Then I, then I started thinking
Is she the one that I wanna be with though?

My girlfriend's getting on my nerves
The arguments are hurting my head
So I ring up the mandem ASAP
Cause I heard there's a rave in west
Raving tonight, man's raving tonight
Raving tonight, I'm going raving tonight
Raving tonight, man's raving tonight
Raving tonight, I'm going raving tonight
