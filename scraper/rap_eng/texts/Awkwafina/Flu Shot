Verse 1:
Ayo today I woke up and looked at my calendar
To see wassup? for the month of December
Oh shit, it's the 5th, time for my favorite spot
It's time to get me a motherfuckin' flu shot

Chorus:
Yeah, yo I'mma get a flu shot
Hey, you coughin', but guess what? I'm not
Why? Cuz I got me a flu shot
That's right, I got me a motherfuckin' flu shot

Verse 2:
Pulled up to the lot in my big Escalade
Pulled out my coupons cuz I get shots prepaid
Sit on the line for about an hour
Then felt a little hungry and I picked up some chowder
Oh hell no!
The chowder was Manhattan, not New England
So I pulled out my musket til the bullets started sprinklin'

Chorus:
Yeah
I'mma get a flu shot
Hey, you sneezin' but guess what? I'm not
Why? Cuz I got me a flu shot
That's right, I got me a motherfuckin' flu shot

Verse 3:
After I start shootin', everyone ran away
So I was the only one gettin' a flu shot that day
I stepped up to the counter and I said
"Hi, how are you? I came to get shot up, you know the one for the flu?"

Chorus:
Yeah
Yo I'mma get a flu shot
Hey you all bloated and nasty and I'm not
Why? Cuz I got me a flu shot
That's right, I got me a motherfuckin' flu shot

Verse 4:
She sat me down before she shot me up
I threw my hair back because I love that stuff
Said "We done now, you can put yo pants back on"
And I said "Thank you miss I-"

I don't really know why I had to take my my pants off
Actually, actually looking back, I was completely naked
