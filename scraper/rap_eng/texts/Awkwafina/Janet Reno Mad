Janet Reno mad
Janet, Janet Reno mad
Janet Reno mad
Cause I shot her in my rap hooks
X3
I stay gettin' cake (whaddup shawty) x8

(chorus)
On your mark bitches
I wanna see em work
All these haters getting mad
Cause I make their girls squirt
Like how she does that
It’s kinda magical
And she call queens smoking weed in the vehicle

[Verse 1: Awkwafina]

But then I roll up
With my swagger but
I’m like Amanda Bynes in that
I don’t give a fuck
I watch A League of Their Own
On laser disk
Guarding my gold from the biters and the plagiarists
Guarding my gold from the biters and the plagiarists
Seems like yesterday was eatin' bacon mac and cheeses
Nice at rollin' blunts because I’m good at folding creases
KCF ain't like me cause I didn’t find Jesus
But I still got freshman Friday
From them scary ass Korean girls
Now I’m showing up at yet another brunch shitshow
Then I shop for things I can’t afford like a millennial
Going home, getting stoned, staring at my macbook
Janet Reno mad cause I shot her in my rap hooks

Whaddup shawty
I stay gettin' cake

(chorus)

[Verse 2: Awkwafina]

Look dad I passed bar, SATS, LSATS
I know you disapproved of my relationship with rap but
That’s still leavin’ me broke
But at the very least not sad
There's a bunch of other shit I could be doing that involves vag
Walnut farmer, areola model, cat or dog walker, reverend Al Sharpton
Cause I believe in karma
While I’m eating shawarma

That some of us are meant to be named after water
That some of us are meant to be named after water

(chorus)
