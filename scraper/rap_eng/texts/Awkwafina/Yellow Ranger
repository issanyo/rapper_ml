Faux thugging
Killa queens loving
You with that bitch look like Pooh Bear's cousin
Block hugging
Bitches liking danger
Saber Tooth Tiger
I'm a ma'fucking Yellow Ranger
And Awkwafina just a ratchet ho
Instagramming kitties, topping swag up on that FroYo
Deez make us out of space
Dollars never saving face
Roll up with these chicken heads
Acting like we own the place
Yo
And I bring that yellow to the rap game
High with these little eyes, Po can't tell if I'm blazed
Shout out to Greenpoint, Kielbasa in the oven
Greenpoint where all the bitches look like Lena Dunham but
Direct deposit that heat up in your inbox
9-to-5 office thighs, scanning on the xerox
But I got some time for a bagel and a muffin
Team, moving forward damn these bitches can't say nothing
But I got this all up on my LinkedIn
Proficient in spitting, turning red when I'm drinking
Emancipating pussy like I was Abe Lincoln
Squirting out that Kool-Aid til all these ratchets sinking, sinking
