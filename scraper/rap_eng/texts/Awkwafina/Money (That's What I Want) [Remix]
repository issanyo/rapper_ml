[Intro: Awkwafina]
(Hey!)
Money, money, I’m in love with money
(Hey!)
Hundreds, hundreds, all I want is hundreds
(Hey!)
Money, money, I’m in love with money
(Hey!)
Hundreds, hundreds, all I want is hundreds
(What?)
Money, money, gotta have the money
(Hey!)
Throw some mo’ in the air, keep it comin’

[Chorus: Cheryl K]
The best things in life are free
But you can give 'em to the birds and bees
I need money
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)

You're love gives me such a thrill
But you're lovin' don't pay my bills
Now give me money
I need money
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
That's what I want
(That's what I want)

[Verse 1: Awkwafina]
Another day, another dollar
Got some money, you can holla’
Want the commas, not the drama
Need a Messi for my mama
Pool full of money
I'ma make it splash
Hundreds in a bag, singles in the trash
All I see is gold, stuck to my nash
A moon made of cheese wouldn’t be enough cash
All yo money faker than some imitation crab meat
Faces on my paper always frownin’
I got mad G’s

[Chorus: Cheryl K]
Oh, Money
(That's what I want)
A lot of money
(That's what I want)
Oh, a lot of money
(That's what I want)

A lot of money
(That's what I want)
That’s what I want
(That's what I want)
That’s what I want
(That's what I want)

[Chorus: Cheryl K]
美好的事情都不挑
请你帮我把这些都甩掉
我需要钱
(就是我想要)
就是我想要
(就是我想要)
就是我想要
(就是我想要)
就是我想要的
(我需要钱)

你的爱让我怕人嫌多
你的爱无法为我满足
我需要钱
就是我想
就是我想
就是我想要的
