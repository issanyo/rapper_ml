Damn, us bitches trynna get work
Midi-mapping kicks, yo, trynna get dirt
Midi-mapping hats, yo, trynna get cake
Waitin' on a dub cause the weed man's late
You know, I throw hard in a motherfucker
It's like that, go hard up in a motherfucker
And now my tracks gettin' played up in the club
That ketamine's lean but it's better than drugs (what?)
Yo, I'm trynna move this brand
Trynna get up until it's cranking like Petland
We seen a drought, now we're wading through the wetlands
I could be the gold chick, I could be the Yes Man

(chorus)
But I think I catch a Law and Order marathon
Send a couple texts, put a motherfucking Snuggie on
I'm sorry Mama, that I am not a doctor
That I rap about the vag and I smoke marijuana-juana
I'm sorry Mama, that I am not a doctor
That I'm talkin' that shit when I smoke marijuana-juana
M-marijuana-juana'
M-marijuana-juana
M-marijuana-juana

I guess you win some and lose some
But my fortune cookies have always read true, son
I got a mouth from the motherfucking west
An involuntary underdog, motherfucking METS
And all these sneak bitches hop up on the train
They squirt when I spit, so yea I make it rain
They scream when I hit, I know exactly what they're saying
I love Awkwafina just like Gucci Gucci Mane does

(chorus)
But I think I catch a Law and Order marathon
Send a couple texts, put a motherfucking Snuggie on
I'm sorry Mama, that I am not a doctor
That I rap about the vag and I smoke marijuana-juana
I'm sorry Mama, that I am not a doctor
That I'm talkin' that shit when I smoke marijuana-juana
M-marijuana-juana'
M-marijuana-juana
M-marijuana-juana
