Verse 1:
I can hear your heartbeat
Sound like a fart on a car seat
And I can read your mind
You wanna fall in love and eat pizza all the time
God damn you luxurious
Prolly make these other girls furious
And I'm curious, you know 'bout me?
Ugly mufucka but I'm kawaii (yeah)

Sanrio gang
Roll that Keroppi, you can tell by the slang
Ain't shit cute when we talkin' bout loot
Trying to get bills like Badtz Maru
These other dudes? Trying to be the man
They too tacky like Lisa Frank
This for the women in the spot with good taste
In kicks or the heels, I'll knot your shoelace
Let's knock boots to 2pac and New Age
When my balls drop p-p-pop the bubbl√©
Rap game can't box me in
I wanna star on a soap on Oxygen
Let the tears roll down ya cheek
When you see Rekstizzy walk down the street
That's just how I be, Ugly mufucka but I'm Kawaii

Prechorus:
Mirror mirror on the wall
Don't say nothing at all
I look good, feel better
I gotta ask, just for the record
How i look, I look good?
Would you wanna fuck me if you could?
How I look, I look bad?
I'll be the best you ever had

Chorus:
How I look?
You's an ugly mufucka but you kawaii
How I look?
I ain't gonna lie you making my nose bleed

Verse 2:
Ay, Hello Kitty where that mouth at?
Face hella pretty, what's around back?
Lady in the street but as a house cat
She a freak, yeah, teeth is a mouse trap
This just a lollipop tune
If somebody get stomped, just party on dude
They'll prolly pop molly and apologize soon
Potty mouths get mollywopped do not parlez vous
But let's talk about you
You a star, young sailor moon
I see the way your whole outfit glow
Don't hesitate to levitate up out them clothes
You see the tears roll down my cheek
When you pop that pussy to the beat
Uh, it's just how I be - ugly mufucka but I'm kawaii

Prechorus:
Mirror mirror on the wall
Don't say nothing at all
I look good, feel better
I gotta ask, just for the record
How i look, I look good?
Would you wanna fuck me if you could?
How I look, I look bad?
I'll be the best you ever had

Chorus:
How I look?
You's an ugly mufucka but you kawaii
How I look?
I ain't gonna lie you making my nose bleed
