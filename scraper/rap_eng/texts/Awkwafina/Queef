[Hook]
Queefing like a G, bitch
Queefing like a G, bitch
Queefing like a G
Queefing like, queefing like like a G

[Verse 1]
I queefs in the morning and I queefs in the night
I went to Benihana and I queefed on sight
I queefs in the trap, queef queefs in the trap
People at the club stare when I'm queefing like that
I don't give a fuck man
All up on the bus man
Queefing lacks treble but the bass is turnt up man
Queef across America, pledge of allegiance
Queefing so bold and they all in agreement

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm F. Scott Queefsgerald
Gatsby of the queef game
Wuthering queefs, cos I'm queefing like a BrontÃ«
I queef out the chorus of Don't Stop Believing
So I can hit an El while these white girls singing
I queef on the B train
Queef on the E train
Chilling at Nassau waiting for the G train
80 minutes later, waiting for the G train
90 minutes later, waiting for the G train
(Waiting for the G train)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm Vin Diesel of the fast and the queefiest
Tokyo Drift, and mine is the breeziest
Queefenor Roosevelt, fireside queefing
Gotta queef soft when my roommates sleeping
I queef on your sister and I queef on your cousin
Then I show your granddad a little queef loving
I queef on your Jerk Seitan, cuz I'm Kobe
Queefing Han Solo
Queefy Wan Kenobi
