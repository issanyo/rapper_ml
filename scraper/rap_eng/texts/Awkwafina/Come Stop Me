[Verse 1: Awkwafina]
Yo it’s that hot shrimp, in yo face, call that shit hibachi
I don’t even need words, koyaanisqatsi
When it come to skin, bitch I’m thick like congee
How I run the game with a dick like Fonzie
And all these chickens on me, Joanies on the Chachi
Hoes on a mission but they can’t afford the Caché
You know I’m tryna holler in a whip, so swampy
You know I’m tryna holler in that whip come stop me

[Chorus]
Watch me
You know I’m tryna holler in that whip come stop me
Come stop me (X4)

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
I’m on that Real Time, Bill Maher, ballin' like the Romneys
Sweater game tight like I’m rolling with the Cosbys
Me and Awkwafina making bread like banh mi
If we have a baby then we namin’ it Dasani
Try me, (Come on, try me), here’s Johnny
New socks every day, fuck doing laundry
Chucks from the swap meet, cups of Don P
Win some dime pieces, gettin’ drunk as my auntie

[Chorus]
Watch me
You know I’m tryna holler in that whip come stop me
Come stop me (X4)
