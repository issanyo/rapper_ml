[Intro]
Oh my god
Do not look, but that guy has a crack pipe and it's out right now
He's beckoning toward us
Don't drop the subway map, bitch
If you drop the subway map, we're never gonna get outta Queens

[Verse 1: Awkwafina]
What's poppin' in the BK, Prospect Expressway
Fuck that museum shit unless it's first Saturday
Bitches be in Bushwick, they all live in Bushwick
They all love Bushwick but I say "FUCK DAT SHIT"
Pull over by the Burg
Hipster pussy market
Feelin' on these vegans despite the smell of armpits
The skinny ones are artists, it's obvious they starving
Your shit art don't pay bills it eats Ramen

[Hook]
New York City Bitch, that's where I come from
Not where I moved to on Mom and Dad's trust fund
New York City bitch, that's how I'm rolling
You out-of-state fakes get your iPad stolen

[Verse 2: Awkwafina]
What exactly is in Red Hook, aside from Ikea
Can I take a train there? No idea
Traffic on Atlantic, bitches stay alien
Yo peep that mess Jay-Z call a stadium
Uptown bro-fest, 20-something douchebags
"Let's get a pint bro, yo where the skanks at?"
East Village poppin', college kids coppin'
Drank too much now the IVs droppin'
West Fourth pizza, stop in front of Joe's
Chillin' with the lezzies outside of the Cubbyhole
Ave of the Americas, driving in the bike lane
Sloppy ass bitches coming out of the PATH train
Bitch, where your pants at? It's 25 degrees out
You eatin' nachos on the block with your pussy out
Queensbridge Projects, Long Island City
Forest motherfuckin' Hills, bitch, get shitty

[Hook]
New York City Bitch, that's where I come from
Not where I moved to on Mom and Dad's trust fund
New York City bitch, that's how I'm rolling
You out-of-state fakes get your iPad stolen

[Verse 3: Awkwafina]
No I'm not from Flushing, I wonder why you think that
Citi Field, bitch, where the overpriced drinks at
What's poppin' in the Bronx, Third Avenue Bridge
All the tranny hookers on the point get it in
Blunts in the whip, now we got the munchies
I wonder if the corner store still sell loosies

[Hook]
New York City Bitch, that's where I come from
Not where I moved to on Mom and Dad's trust fund
New York City bitch, that's how I'm rolling
You out-of-state fakes get your iPad stolen

[Outro]
Bitch
Oh my god, oh my god. Wait, here's...
Okay, okay. To your right, there's this Asian girl. She has two live chickens in cages. She just punched a man for a subway seat, and she is coming toward u---This is Awkwafina, bitch. I just stole yo iPad and now imma sell it to buy more live chickens
