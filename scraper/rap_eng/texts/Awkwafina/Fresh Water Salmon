(That's it
That's that smooth shit though
You know how it is
Yes)

Uh, shut a hater mouth
Plug it with a tampon
So all my haters sleep
With a fuckin' lamp on
I slap a ratchet with a
Palm full of talcum
Cause I'm just a ratchet straight
Schemin' like Plankton

All up in the whip
Ghost ride like a drifter
Girl is a walrus
She a shape-shifter
Yeah I got that shake
Pour it down in the sifter
Tia and Tamera
God damn, god sisters

[Hook x2]

Yo when I spit, they squirt
When I spit, they squirt and
Awkwafina make it wet
All they haters hurtin'

Bitch I'm a flame thrower
You can call me Charizard
All these trainers trying to
Catch me in they Pokeball
My hurricane punch
Now all these bitches done
I rock a solar beam
Fuck your water gun

I'm in that Nissan
Nah I ain't gotta Aston
I fuck with old shit
Yeah, you can call me Ashton
I slap a ratchet with a
Fresh water salmon
This is for my ratchets straight
Schemin' like Plankton

[Hook x2]

All them haters hurtin (x4)
