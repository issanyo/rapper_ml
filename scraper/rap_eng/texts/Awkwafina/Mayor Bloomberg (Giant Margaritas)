Okay cause when we trynna ball out
Big size
Ass up
Snake eyes
Please don’t take my freedom
My giant margarita

Or maybe imma dream
About an eighty-ounce Zima
Or maybe imma Queens up
With hookah and some beasters

Remember menthols?
Cop them with a fake, though
Counting out my quarters so I can buy some papes, though
This is for my corner store
[?] and [?]
This is for my SUNY bitches’
Wine in a box

I ain’t trynna go to MoMA
I’m trynna drink mimosas
Ain’t trynna join that book club
But trynna use a coaster

Friday night
Shitfaced
Out of sake
Falling over
Friday night
Shithouse
Giant margarita rolling

[Spoken Interlude: Awkwafina]
You know, the thing with me is that I was born with a second vestigial gooch
To have that burden
In a—in a spiritual way
In a philosophical way
In just a physiological—like walking around—
They would call me double-gooch
Loads of gooch
Having a second vestigial gooch actually solidified my identity more, as, as you know
Asian
Female
Second-gooch

[Verse 2: Awkwafina]
Yeah
Tryna shake my ass
To some Neptunes
Wake up in the morning
In the Applebee’s restroom

Damn, I’m in it
Swag’s revolution-al
That’s why Albany called your ban
Unconstitutional
