[Hook]
I could be your Peggy
I could, I could be your Peggy
(x2)

If you be my Al Bundy
If you be my Al Bundy, be my Al Bundy
If you be my Al Bundy

[Verse 1]
You got Capri Sun
Mix it in with some Stolis
Can you really blow smoke O’s?
Can you show me?
I’m just trying to get to know ya
You’ll get to know me
Driving in a Maxima
Playing Bon Jovi, eh

I think you’re funny
Lie down in your pink shades
And yes I wanna be your Bonnie,
Patti Mayonnaise
‘Cause I can see us passing all of our days
Watching Netflix, listening to shoegaze, righ?

No, I never get it wrong
All my friends see how the man got me on
Waiting for the texts, wait, waiting for the call
Clarissa can’t explain how my shit’s fucked up

[Hook]
But I could be your Peggy
I could, I could be your Peggy
I could be your Peggy
I could, I could be your Peggy

If you be my Al Bundy
If you be my Al Bundy, be my Al Bundy
If you be my Al Bundy

[Verse 2]
Afterschool, I used to watch you play handball
Your Power Rangers cards,
Your Stretch Armstrong
You won’t admit it, but I know you watched Spongebob
After getting blazed in your car,
Your mom’s car

But damn I’ve never been so sprung
A-sipping on Stoli and Capris Sun
Twelve-steps boy better than drugs
I sniff you off a stick, and shoot you up

[Hook]
But I could be your Peggy
I could, I could be your Peggy
I could be your Peggy
I could, I could be your Peggy

If you be my Al Bundy
If you be my Al Bundy (yo), be my Al Bundy
If you be my Al Bundy
