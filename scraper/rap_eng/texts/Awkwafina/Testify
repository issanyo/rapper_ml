Verse 1:
Young Fina
Slanty eyed dreamer
Fuck a 9 to 5
I was born to be a leader
Driving on Kissena
Cool and calm demeanor
Faith healer waiting on a weed dealer, free wheelin'
And I know I probably started late
You know I didn't hit the game 'til 2008
But I've been writing these rhymes on the 7 train
Puttin in times, blowing minds, don't hesitate

Chorus:
Outside city vibes
Queens is a trek, so
None of my city friends have visited yet
But it's alright, I don't mind, give it time
Imma make the city so proud
Let me testify this
Let me testify this
Ain't gotta justify shit
I'm that chick
Yo
Imma make this city so proud
Let me testify

Verse 2:
Not a happy camper when I'm stepping off a weight scale
Cons of being famous is a constant flow of hate mail
Think I'll call an Uber, breaking bank at the bake sale
Fake it 'til you make it, they don't need to know the details

Chorus:
Outside city vibes
Queens is a trek
So none of my city friends have visited yet
But it's alright, I don't mind, give it time
Imma make the city so proud
Let me testify this
Let me testify this
Ain't gotta justify shit
I'm that chick
Yo
Imma make this city so proud
Let me testify this
Let me testify this
Ain't gotta justify shit
Im that chick
Yo
Imma make this city so proud
Let me testify
Testify
Testify this
Let me testify this
Imma make this city so proud
Let me testify
Testify
Testify this
Imma make this city so proud
Let me testify
