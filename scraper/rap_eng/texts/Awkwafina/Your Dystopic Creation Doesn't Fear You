[Rap: Awkwafina]
Rats!
Rascals
Rats!
Rascals
Ay, Rats!
Rascals
Rats!
Rascals
Hey El Paso
Better keep em on a lasso
In a rent control castle
Summer heat while the street teems assholes
Ay
And I been getting like a hot mess
Hella rare like Loch Ness
Juz pennies in the pockets
Not green but I’m smokin like a botanist
Ay, say Rats

[Chorus: Satomi Matsuzaki]
I’ve been in your cage 400 days, so why would I listen when you say, “worry worry baby?“
I’ve been in your cage 400 days, so why would I listen when you say, “worry worry baby?“

Low low low low!

[Chorus: Satomi Matsuzaki]
I taught you to dance 400 ways, so why would I listen when you say, "worry worry baby?”
