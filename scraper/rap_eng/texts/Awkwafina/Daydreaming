[Verse 1]
Kevin Bacon, why you hatin'?
I just want to make our bodies adjacent
In the back seat of a Subaru
Wining and dining at the Tellers' barbecue
And you can act out scenes from the Hollow Man
I could get Footloose all up in my Netherlands
Fuck Neve Campbell and Denise Richards
Though you can throw Matt Dillon into the picture

[Chorus]
I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?
Yo, I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?

[Verse 2]
Chris Christie, you's a man beast
I love it when you yelling at me on the TV
With yo white shirt,  is that a taco stain?
I'll give you cookies if you promise that I'll get laid
Bitch show me the world, or just Jersey
We could make Teaneck so dirty
And I don't blame you, for the Bridgegate
Cause you are still the governor of my mid-range

[Chorus]
I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?
Yo, I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?

[Verse 3]
Yo Sinbad, where you been at?
I wrote you messages I even sent a sext fax
I want to hold you in a hot tub
Tell you my fears while you givin' me a back rub
I wouldn't throw a fit, if you was my house guest
Just know that I will put that D on house arrest
In a different world, we will be lovers
We could have a foursome with Urkel and Sally Struthers

[Chorus]
I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?
Yo, I'm day dreaming 'bout a man like that
What I would do with a man like that?
