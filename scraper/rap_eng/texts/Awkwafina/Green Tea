Intro: Margaret Cho
With every pussy
A pair of shoes will go to a child in need

Verse 1: Awkwafina
Yeah
Flip a stereotype
How an Asian bitch got concubines?
Turn a grown man to a bashful bride
With a vag that will leave him immobilized
But 'fina wasn't born with the gas
As a matter of fact, I was born with a rash
As a matter of fact, got a concave ass
Still the hoes line up like a paragraph

Hook: Awkafina and Margaret
Yellow bitches in the driver's seat (x3)
Bitch drive that Corolla right into the streets
Yellow bitches in the driver's seat (x3)
Bitch drive that Corolla right into the streets
We got that bomb pussy
That Long Duk Dong pussy
Make you call your mom pussy
Get a pair of TOMS pussy
Got that Soon Yi pussy
Be all you want to be pussy
That Giving Tree pussy
You belong to me pussy

Verse 2: Margaret Cho
Hello, this is taste of jasmine
Never been, never will be a has-been
Rub it, you'll feel like Aladdin
I'll dish it cause I might be into casting

Verse 3: Awkwafina
Us yellow bitches livin' fancy gettin' beef like Kobe
Us yellow bitches datin' white boys that look just like Moby
Us yellow bitches eatin' fruits and shit at karaoke
Pull up in a second hand Mazda
Pull up in a Hyundai Elantra

[Outra Awkwafina (Margaret Cho)]:
(Came out my belly with a suture
Awkwafina is the future)
Aw thank you that's so sweet
Thank you Margaret
Margaret?
(Hello
Every pussy
A pair of shoes will go to a child in need)
Why would you-
Why the accent? Ok
(With every pussy
A pair of shoes will go to a child in need)
I feel like we didn't necessarily agree to that
I don't think we have to
(Hello?)
Ok. Hi. Hi yes
(How come you never call me?)
I think the accent is unnecessary
(How come you never call me?
Finally
Call me
