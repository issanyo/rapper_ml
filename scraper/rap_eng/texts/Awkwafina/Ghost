[Verse 1]
Got a hipster man on a Vespa
He a vegan so we always eatin' chestnuts (chestnuts)
And he brewin' kombucha in a bathtub (back up)
Film school SUNY but he graduated bankrupt
Yeah I’m his number one fan though
Drop it down
Serenade me on a banjo
Body fit like his daddy was a Brando
Know his daddy rich, why he livin' in a van though?
Got another dude, think he a bro though
So I'ma let him do all that he Pinot
Penn State grad and he loves Scarface
Fine ass sucka' love talkin' 'bout his car make
But I ain’t flinch at his CV stats
'Cause the man ate poop when he pledged a frat
And the man's explaining what's this and that
Meanwhile I’m like “Can you shut the fuck up, Steve?”

[Chorus]
Yeah
I don't know about that
Had to go bro, sorry I ain’t even text back, yeah
Nah nah I don't know about that man
Nah nah i dunno about that
Had to ghost
Break it off (x3)
Had to ghost
Break it off (x3)
Had to ghost
Break it off (x3)
Had to ghost ghost ghost ghost
Break it off (x3)

[Verse 2]
Got a Fairfax, hypebeast Ye lover
Loves Drake, Big Sean, and Don Glover
Camped out three nights for the new Supreme
And when he falls asleep he got Yeezy dreams but
Mothafucka, like, why you got a vape though
Rockin' Vans and you don’t even skate tho
Keith Ape and it's cool to rock Bape now
Now Jump Man's dabbin' in the OVO goose down
And I feel for the bitches
Strong ass, independent, fly ass bitches
Guess all the motherfuckas lied to us bitches
'Cause the life is an ocean they still gon’ swim as fishes

[Chorus]
Yeah
I don't know about that
Had to go bro, sorry I ain’t even text back, yeah
Nah nah I don't know about that man
Nah nah i dunno about that
Had to ghost
Break it off (x3)
Had to ghost
Break it off (x3)
Had to ghost
Break it off (x3)
Had to ghost ghost ghost ghost
Break it off (x3)
