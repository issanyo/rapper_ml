[Intro: Justin Vernon]
Oooo, hmhm
Ooo, oooo
Oooo, one morning, yeah

[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
Give it a body
Wanna talk to it
And you will move your heart from space
Just to be a body
Wanna talk to me
And I want to walk over to the open space

[Verse 2: Francis and the Lights]
They don't know who that du-, du-
They don't know
They don't know who that du-
They don't know

[Outro: Francis and the Lights]
It was just for fun
It was just for us
