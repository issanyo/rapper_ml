I like girls oh they always look so good to me
I like girls even though they tease and torture me
I like girls I could never choose just one
That would ruin all the fun,oh ooh I like girls
Oh, oooh, I like girls

Now listen
I like girls in the summer
Girls in the fall
Girls all year I wish I could have them all

Girls from other countries with crazy names
I love it when they tell me, "papi no ingles"
Oh,oooh, oh oooh
Come a little closer
Oh,oooh, oh oooh


I like girls oh they always look so good to me
I like girls even though they tease and torture me
I like girls I could never choose just one
That would ruin all the fun oh, oooh I like girls
Oh, oooh I like girls

I like girls all colours
I ain't got a type
Girls who drink bud and Smirnoff ice
Girls with big booties
Girls in tight jeans
Girls who wanna lay around and watch TV

Oh,oooh, oh oooh
Come a little closer
Oh,oooh, oh oooh

Listen
I like girls oh they always look so good to me
I like girls even though they tease and torture me
I like girls I could never choose just one
That would ruin all the fun, oh oooh I like girls
Oh oooh I like girls

I like girls oh they always look so good to me
I like girls even though they tease and torture me
I like girls I could never choose just one
That would ruin all the fun I like girls
I like girls
I like girls
