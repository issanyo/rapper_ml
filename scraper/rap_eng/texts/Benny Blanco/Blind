[Verse 1]
I think you got the best of me
You're sleeping with the enemy
You left me all alone, alone, alone, alone
The beat drops, I'm solo
My heart stops, I already know
You left me all alone, alone, alone, alone

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of the mess you made me
You're never gonna catch me cry
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me 'til the day you die
Without me, you're nothing
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me 'til the day you die

[Verse 2]
I've let go, finally over you
This drama that you put me through
I'm better all alone, alone, alone, alone
The beat drops, you're solo
It's last call, and it's gotten old
Now look who's all all alone, alone, alone, alone

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of the mess you made me
You're never gonna catch me cry
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me 'til the day you die
Without me, you're nothing
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me 'til the day you die

[Bridge]
I trusted you, you were the first
Then you lied and it gets worse
You broke me down
Now, just look around
Who's all alone?
Who's all alone now?

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of the mess you made me
You're never gonna catch me cry
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me 'til the day you die
Without me, you're nothing
You must be blind if you can't see
You'll miss me 'til the day you die
