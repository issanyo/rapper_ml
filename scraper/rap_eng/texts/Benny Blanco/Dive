[Verse 1]
Maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
I can live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks in the lake

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Verse 2]
You're a mystery
You're a mystery
I've travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
What's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
I can live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

[Outro]
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
