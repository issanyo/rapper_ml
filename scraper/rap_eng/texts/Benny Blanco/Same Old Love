[Verse 1]
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
And I'm not one to forget, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe, I can't believe it
You left in peace, you left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, and I'm on my knees
Right now

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, and my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

[Verse 2]
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
You know
So don't you try and change your mind
'Cause I won't be changing too, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, you left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, and I'm on my knees
Right now

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, and my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

[Bridge]
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that same old love
I'm so sick of that

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Love, love, that same old love, that same old love
