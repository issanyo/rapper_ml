[Intro: Sean Foreman & Kid Cudi]
Black dress (yeah) with the tights (uh) underneath (yeah...)

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I’ve been feeling some type of way about her
Wanna wife her, borderline I don’t really like her
‘Cause she like to play around and she know she got it
In turn and make a kid not really want it
A bad bitch who know she a bad bitch
Worst type in the world if you ask me
Shit, worst thing in the world is emotions
So I’m sitting here trying to go through the motion
Get along but it would be better if we boned
You don’t understand, I don’t need you honey
I beat my dick like it owe me money
She get around, probably fuck yo homie
She text me, then she probably gonna text Drake
‘Cause it be the ones, man, with the pretty face
I guess it be the Moon Man who cracked the case

[Chorus: Nathaniel Motte & Sean Foreman]
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
Xs on the back of your hands
Washed them in the bathroom to drink like the bands
And the setlist (setlist) you stole off the stage
Has red and purple lipstick all over the page
Br—br—br—bruises cover your arms
Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm
And the best is (best is), no one knows who you are
Just another girl alone at the bar

[Chorus: Nathaniel Motte & Sean Foreman]
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me

[Bridge: Nathaniel Motte & Sean Foreman]
Shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips

[Interlude: Kid Cudi]
Hey, hater
Sign language
Middle finger
Middle finger
Let me tell you now
Inter-galactical
I see you rockin wit, oh
I see them 3-O folk

[Chorus: Nathaniel Motte & Sean Foreman]
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me
