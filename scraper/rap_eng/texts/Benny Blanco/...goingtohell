[Verse 1 - Miguel]
Are you afraid of me?
Because I'm afraid of you
Cause I'm afraid of what this could mean
And I'm afraid of what this could do

[Chorus - Miguel]
Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you
With you, with you, with you
I don't care, I'm in love, in love

[Refrain - Miguel]
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner

[Verse 2- Miguel]
These bittersweet notions of forever
Blossom and find me in my dreams
If we should die, I hope we die together
If not, at least I'll know just where we'll be

[Chorus - Miguel]
Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you
With you, with you, with you
I don't care, I'm in love, in love

[Refrain - Miguel]
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus - Miguel]
Going to hell, I know, I know
I don't care, I'm in love
I'm going to hell with you  (Only you can save me I'm a sinner)
With you, with you, with you (Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner)
I don't care, I'm in love, in love (Only you can save me I'm a sinner) (Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner)

[Refrain]
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner
Only you can save me I'm a sinner
Save me I'm, save me I'm a sinner, baby
