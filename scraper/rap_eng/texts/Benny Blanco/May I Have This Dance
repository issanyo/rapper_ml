[Verse 1]
In the ground, we bury
The seeds of a pear tree
All the things, we carried
Now we're down to our bare feet

[Chorus]
May I have this dance?
To make it up to you
Can I say something crazy?
I love you
Give me both your hands
To make it up to you
Let me spin and excite you

[Verse 2]
We are bound to inherit
(Ooooooooooooh)
The sins of our parents
(Ooooooooooooh)
And all of the people we passed through
(Ooooooooooooh)
Now we're down to the last two

[Chorus]
May I have this dance?
To make it up to you
Can I say something crazy?
I love you
Give me both your hands
To make it up to you
Let me spin and excite you

[Bridge]
To make it up to you
Dance
To make it up to you
Ooooooooooooh

[Chorus]
May I have this dance?
To make it up to you
(Can I say something crazy?)
Can I say something crazy?
I love you
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
|To make it up to you|
Give me one more
Let me spin and excite you

[Outro]
To make it up to you
Never gonna stay
Can I say something crazy?
I love you
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
|To make it up to you|
Give me one more
Let me spin and excite you
