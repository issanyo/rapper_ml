[Intro]
I.........I................
Never meant to break my own promises
Never meant to break my own promises
(Promises, these promises, promises, these promises)

[Verse 1]
Again with excuses and generally wastin' my time
Not findin' solutions, just seekin' my peace of mind
No hocus or pocus, my focus is drunk on the floor
And mumbling something about, "one more!"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm fallin' across the line
Keep punchin' pedals at the amber lights
And I cross my heart and hope to die
Unless I happen to lie, I

[Chorus]
Never meant to break my own promises
Never meant to break my own promises
Oh, one more night, I said it the last time
This is the last time, I'll say it a million more
Never meant to my break my own promises
Break my own promises
(Promises, these promises, promises, these promises)

[Verse 2]
I said I was tryin', I really was drivin' the coast
The fight or the flight, well, I side with the latter most
It almost is laughable, but when I chuckle, I choke
Can't get the words out my throat, oh, one more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Is that my lion's pride?
I meet my mountain then I run and hide
And I cross my heart and hope to die
Unless I happen to lie, I

[Chorus]
Never meant to break my own promises
Never meant to break my own promises
Oh, one more night, I said it the last time
This is the last time, I'll say it a million more
Never meant to my break my own promises
Break my own promises
(Promises, these promises, promises, these promises)
