We've been here before
I'm done losin' hope
Of all the bad boys
You're badder than most
And I couldn't see all your flaws
Below your charms
And you cannot see all my scars
Your love has caused

See I will get over you
You're not the man I once knew
You've taken the best of me
Left me with nothing new
See I will get over you

I'm takin' that chance
And I'm breakin' free
You've hid me away
Now I can't find me
And I couldn't see all your flaws
Below your charms
And you cannot see all my scars
Your love has caused

See I will get over you
You're not the man I once knew
You've taken the best of me
Left me with nothing new
See I will get over you

I cut these ties
We say goodbyes
To Love you not would be a lie
Now Go and find another mind
To stain the way that you did to mine
That you did to mine
That you did to mine
That you did to mine
That you did to mine

See I will get over you
You're not the man I once knew
You've taken the best of me
Left me with nothing new
See I will get over you
