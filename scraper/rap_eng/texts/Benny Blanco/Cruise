[Verse 1]
(And they may say it's not for children)
Of course it is
(And they may say it's not for you)
It's for you
(In a short while we'll be riding in cars that drive themselves)

[Chorus]
And we'll all just cruise
(Can we just cruise?)
([?])
And we'll all just (cruise)

[Verse 2]
We're climbing over the consoles in our sleep
We're marveling at how far the seat's go back
In a short while we'll be guided by stars that guide themselves
(I'm losing you)
It'll be so safe and so helpful

[Chorus]
And we'll all just cruise
(Can we just cruise?)
([?])
And we'll all just (cruise)

[Outro]
In its, in its own world now
