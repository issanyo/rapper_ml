Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Lose control
Collision course
With you, my love
Call 9-1-1

[Pre-Chorus]
So roll the dice
Get lucky tonight
I know you're holding back
No more hesitation

[Chorus]
Just come on
I want your naked love
So don't you dress it up tonight
Come on
You know your naked love
Is what I'm dreaming of tonight

[Chorus 1]
Ohhh-oh-oh
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohhh-oh-oh
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Take it off
And try me on
The hottest threads
You've ever worn

[Pre-Chorus]
So roll the dice
Get lucky tonight
I know you're holding back
No more hesitation

[Chorus]
Just come on
I want your naked love
So don't you dress it up tonight
Come on
You know your naked love
Is what I'm dreaming of tonight

[Chorus 1]
Ohhh-oh-oh
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohhh-oh-oh
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Just come on
I want your naked love
So don't you dress it up tonight
Come on
You know your naked love
Is what I'm dreaming of tonight

[Chorus 1]
Ohhh-oh-oh
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohhh-oh-oh
Whoa-ohhh-ohhh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
