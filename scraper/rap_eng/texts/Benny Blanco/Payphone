[Intro: Gianni]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

[Verse 1: Gianni]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in that time that you wasted
All of our bridges burnt down

[Pre-Hook: Gianni]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus: Gianni & Marshall]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, yeah

[Verse 2: Gianni & Gianni and Sarah]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burnt down

[Pre-Hook: Gianni, Marshall, & Sarah]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus: Gianni, Marshall, & Sarah]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Verse 3: Sarah]
Man, fuck that shit
I'm pretty sure that payphones don't even exist
When I was trying to call home
You were leaving me alone in bliss
You should change the words in this song
Let these people know all the shit you did wrong
Listen, boy, I ain't gonna answer the phone
So you can leave a message after the tone
Beeeeeeep

[Chorus: Gianni & Gianni, Marshall, and Sarah]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone
