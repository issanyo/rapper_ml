[Chorus]
Lights flashing in my eyes
As I look up at the sky
There was no time to say goodbye
All the lights were flashing in my eyes

[Verse 1]
I know it seems ridiculous
Cause I never believed in this
Something was taking over me
This wasn't the place I wanna be

[Verse 2]
I felt a shatter from the crash
Didn't know it happened all so fast
I was stuck in a frozen state
Never thought that this would be my fate

[Chorus]
Lights flashing in my eyes
As I look up at the sky
There was no time to say goodbye
All the lights were flashing in my eyes

[Verse 3]
Whatever did you want from me
Let me go I'll tell you everything
Just wanna go back to my life
Won't tell a soul about the flight

[Verse 4]
How long is this supposed to last
I see stars shining through the glass
Looks like I won't be home today
Won't make my anniversary

[Chorus
Lights flashing in my eyes
As I look up at the sky
There was no time to say goodbye
All the lights were flashing in my eyes

[Bridge]
In the wrong place and in the wrong time
And now that I'm trapped you look in my mind
You do what you want, you see what you like
Feeling so lost, nothing in sight
I don't wanna stare another moment in your eyes
Never know what it was like to look down at the sky (I'm saying)

[Chorus]
Lights flashing in my eyes
As I look up at the sky
There was no time to say goodbye
All the lights were flashing in my eyes
