[Verse 1]
Say you love me to my face
I need it more than your embrace
Say you want me, that's all it takes
Hearts get torn from your mistakes

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
Babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's flown away

[Verse 2]
Just say you love me, just for today
Don't give me time
'Cause that's not the same
I wanna feel burning flames when you say my name
I wanna feel passion flow into my bones like blood through my veins

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
Babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's flown away

[Bridge]
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
Oh, but all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
Oh, babe, it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's flown away

[Outro]
Just say you love me
