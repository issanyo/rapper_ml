[Verse 1]
Always running from what feels right
Too fast and I didn't know
Then I'm in a toast daylight
You're here, no way to let go
Don't look back when you're holding me
Cause I know what this love was meant to be

[Chorus]
One day, we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms
We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever
Cause we'll wake up together

[Verse 2]
I got something and it feels right
What I needed to be, can't control what you feel for me
I was watching you the whole night
I can never explain how the magic was made
Don't look back when you're holding me
Cause I know what this love was meant to be

[Chorus]
One day, we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms
We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever
Cause we'll wake up together

[Breakdown]
One day you won't wanna go home
And it feels so good in my arms
You won't wanna go home
Cause we wake up together
