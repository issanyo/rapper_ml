[Verse 1]
I had a dream the other night
About how we only get one life
Woke me up right after two
Stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn't lose my mind
And I had the week that came from hell
And yes, I know that you can tell
But you're like the net under the ledge
When I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we're only here once I wanna live with

[Chorus]
You've got something I need
In this world full of people there's one loving me
And if we're only here once, I wanna live with you
You've got something I need
In this world full of people, there's one loving me
And if we're only here once, I wanna live with you

[Verse 2]
Last night I think I drank too much
Call it our temporary crutch
With broken words I've tried to say
Honey don't you be afraid
If we've got nothing, we got us

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we're only here once I wanna live with

[Chorus]
You've got something I need
In this world full of people there's one loving me
And if we're only here once, I wanna live with you

[Bridge]
I know that we're not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it
To this time, this time, now
You've got something I need
In this world full of people, there's one loving me
And if we're only here once, I wanna live with you

[Chorus]
You've got something I need
In this world full of people there's one loving me
And if we're only here once, I wanna live with you
You've got something I need
In this world full of people, there's one loving me
And if we're only here once, I wanna live with you
And if we're only here once, I wanna live with
And if we're only here once, I wanna live with you
