[Intro: Ke$ha]
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Just wild in, shades on my face
Eyes on my kicks, lights on my face
Speakers gon' blow, speakers got bass
Bottles on ice, haters gon' hate
Bobby don't care, Bobby's so straight
Bobby from the hood, so Bobby don't play
Bobby burn good
What they prolly gon' say
Sicker than the stuff like ravioli
So bon appetite, Just got a zipper
Blow like a missile, White clef kush
I've been goin' til November
Where the grand gripper?
Word to my dealer
You better remember
I'm from the city where the shorty's and players live
Nice stars out at the ATL
And prolly won't end til 8am
Yeah, I'm an ATLien
An extraterrestrial, obsessed with the vegetable
Up in the air with no parachute
I ain't contested the best in the area
Even the vision impaired, one can tell
That you can see where I'm coming from
And leave all when I'm done
Hater miss me with a bunch of joke
Cause this place's about to blow
I can push stroke here
And ninety feet like a bungee jump
Let's go!

[Interlude: Ke$ha]
We are taking over
Dance

[Verse 2: Ke$ha]
Back door cracked, we don't need a key
We get in for free
No VIP sleaze
Drink that Kool-Aid, follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're coming with me

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ke$ha]
It's time to kill the lights and shut the DJ down
(This place about to)
Tonight we're taking over, no one's getting out

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to

[Verse 3: Ke$ha]
Now what? (What)
We're taking control
We get what we want
We do what you don't
Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored, ha!

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ke$ha]
It's time to lose your mind and let the crazy out
(This place about to)
Tonight we're takin' names, 'cause we don't mess around

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to

[Bridge: Ke$ha]
Go-go-go-go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes
Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes

[Interlude]
We are taking over
Get used to it, okay?

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to
