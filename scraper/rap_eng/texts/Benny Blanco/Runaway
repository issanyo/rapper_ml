[Intro]
If it takes two, I'm betting on you
To hold me tight when tides are high
What'll you do? I'm waiting on you
To dry these tears you made me cry

[Verse 1]
Feet colder than the snow that choked the city
My wings too wild to clip and cage around me
So maybe I'm "selfish" for being an actor
Pretending to gather when I am the hunter
Or maybe Iâ€™m wicked, an Eve to the apple
Or maybe I'm hungry for more than I've got
All I know is that I've got to

[Chorus]
Runaway (run, run, run)
Runaway (run, run, run)
Runaway (run, run, run)
Runaway (oh!)

[Verse 2]
They tell me temper, temper, little lady
Better bite that tongue, it is not becoming
My blood boils rapids to break the levy
Yeah, let it keep on running, running
And maybe I'm crazy for claiming my freedom
For loving and leaving, a sick little heathen
It could be so simple, a prick and a thimble
Equipped with a map and a guide to decide
All I know is that I've got to

[Chorus]
Runaway (run, run, run)
Runaway (run, run, run)
Runaway (run, run, run)
Runaway (oh!)

[Bridge]
No, you don't know me
And I don't know myself
You better lose me now
Before I lose myself
No, you don't love me
And I don't love myself
You better lose me now
Before I lose myself

[Interlude]
(Run, run, run, run, run...)
