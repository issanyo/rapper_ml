[Verse 1: Christina] [Cold Water]
Everybody gets lost sometimes, you know?
That's how we learn and how we grow
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

[Pre-Chorus 1: Lauren] [Let Me Love You]
You go through the darkest of days
Heavens a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a heck of a ride driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

[Chorus 1: Lisa] [Cold Water]
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[Verse 2: Amy] [Let Me Love You]
I used to believe
That we were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Selling a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
On a miracle

[Pre-Chorus 2: Dani] [Cold Water]
And if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us to different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know, I won't let go

[Chorus 2: Lauren] [Let Me Love You]
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you

[Bridge: Katherine] [Cold Water]
So, come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope someoneâ€™s gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know; you won't let go

[Chorus - [Cold Water], (Let Me Love You)]
(Lauren)
Don't you give up, nah nah nah
I won't give up, nah nah nah
[Lisa]
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go, I'll be your lifeline tonight
[Christina]
I won't let go
(Dani)
So don't give up, nah nah nah
[Christina]
I won't let go
(Dani)
So don't you give up, nah nah nah
[Christina]
I won't let go
