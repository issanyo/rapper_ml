[Verse 1]
Everything outside is grey and lonely
Spark electricity in our city, yeah
Let's light it up
Falling under pressure, I can feel the butterflies
Oh, you blow smoke inside my mouth
You light me up

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can be your work of art for life
You just show me what you want tonight

[Chorus]
So together we can breathe
I wanna give you all of me
Open up your eyes and love me, love me, love me
When I'm falling to my knees
I wanna give you all of me
You know how to take care of me, of me, of me
Together we can breathe
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Love me, love me
Together we can breathe
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Love me, love me

[Verse 2]
Addicted to the colors that you're using on me
Clouds above my head are beautiful and red
Blow it up
It's crystal clear with you, nothing's a blur
Just inhale me into your world
And blow it up

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can be your work of art for life
You just show me what you want for life

[Chorus]
So together we can breathe
I wanna give you all of me
Open up your eyes and love me, love me, love me
When I'm falling to my knees
I wanna give you all of me
You know how to take care of me, of me, of me
Together we can breathe
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Love me, love me
Together we can breathe
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Love me, love me

[Bridge]
Together we can breathe
In and out, it's all I need
To taste the sweet
To feel complete, woah
In and out, it's all I need
To breathe, to breathe
We can breathe, oh

[Chorus]
I wanna give you all of me
Open up your eyes and love me, love me, love me
When I'm falling to my knees
I wanna give you all of me
You know how to take care of me, of me, of me
So together we can breathe
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
You love me, you love me
So together we can breathe, oh yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
You love me, you love me
So together we can breathe
