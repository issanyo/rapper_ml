Hittin' on me, boy

D-I-N-O-S-A you are a dinosaur
A D-I-N-O-S-A you are a dinosaur
An O-L-D M-A-N, you're an old man
Hittin' on me, boy, you need a CAT scan

Old man, why are you starin' at me?
Mack on me and my friend, it's kinda creepy
You should be prowlin' around the old folk's home
Come on, brother, leave us alone

At first I thought that it was kinda funny
That you're the age of my grandpa, pappy
But for real, I know you got lots of money
But I still won't get down with you, honey

D-I-N-O-S-A you are a dinosaur
A D-I-N-O-S-A you are a dinosaur
An O-L-D M-A-N, you're an old man
Hittin' on me, boy, you need a CAT scan

Not long 'til you're a senior citizen
And you can strut around with that sexy bag of oxygen
Honey, your toupee is fallin' to your left side
Get up and go, brother, save yourself a little pride

You sit down,, buy me a martini
Won't go away, my hints aren't sinking
"Hey," you say, "wanna come with me?"
I'm about to barf, seriously

Hey, buddy, are those teeth real?
Yeah, how many times have you been married?
Seriously, I mean are you wearing your diapers?
Kesh, they're called Depends
Honey, it's bingo night, you're missing bingo night
Well, Kesh, it's not even that, it's past his bedtime anyway
He needs to go home and get tucked in
And take his teeth out and take all those pills
Totally, I mean what skeezy old guy just hangs around a bar
And hits on cute young girls, anyway?
He must have amnesia and lost his way and somehow wandered in here
Aw, he must think that, like, we're his grandkids
No, no sir, no we're not
Bingo night's that way
Turn around, okay
No skeezy old guys for us
Thank you, thanks, have a good night
Have a good night, buddy, see ya

D-I-N-O-S-A you are a dinosaur
A D-I-N-O-S-A you are a dinosaur
An O-L-D M-A-N, you're an old man
Hitting on me, boy, you need a CAT scan

D-I-N-O-S-A you are a dinosaur
A D-I-N-O-S-A you are a dinosaur
An O-L-D M-A-N, you're just an old man
Hittin' on me boy
