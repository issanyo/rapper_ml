[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I got room in the back seat
If you really wanna get freaky
You already know I don't care
We can do it anywhere like 1-12
Still sitting in the valet
Skip all of the foreplay
I'm fiending for it, I need a fix
I got a problem, I'm addicted (oh yeah)

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
And you don't judge me
'Cause if you did baby, I would judge you too
And no one rides me the way you do
You remind me of my coupe
'Cause I got issues and you got 'em too
So give em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Different positions all around the room
I know I try to keep my cool but I'ma lose
'Cause I got issues and I wanna have sex every time that I see you

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I see you working (oh yeah)
Know just how to drop low-key
Bring it back up, whine slow (ooh)
You're perfect, your body's perfect
So glad that you came through
It ain't a position you can't do (hey)

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
And you don't judge me
'Cause if you did baby, I would judge you too
And no one rides me the way you do
You remind me of my coupe
'Cause I got issue and you got em too
So give me all of yours and I'll give mine to you
Different positions all around the room
I know I try to keep my cool but I'ma lose
'Cause I got issues and I wanna have sex every time that I see you

[Bridge: Kid Ink]
Just trust me, ain't nobody gonna come into this room
Drop them panties down, and hop upon me
She got them moves, Janet Jackson with them moves

[Chorus: Julia Michaels]
'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory, of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you
