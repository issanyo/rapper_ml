[Verse 1]
You cast a spell on me
I was broken by the breeze
And runnin' from the ones behind me
Just in it for the game
A wild thing to tame
But you took my hand and ran beside me

[Chorus]
I'm slippin' up under my feet
Hallelujah, believe
Hear my heart beat major keys
Nothin' competes
When love is free

[Verse 2]
My compass may be broke
But you follow where I go
And you never really seem to mind it
Sun, stare it in the eye
Now, I'm blinded by the light
But seein' you with eyes wide open

[Chorus]
I'm slippin' up under my feet
Hallelujah, believe
Hear my heart beat major keys
Nothin' competes
When love is free

[Bridge]
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball when we're together
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball when we're together
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball when we're together
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball when we're together
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball when we're together
Not a ball or a chain, just a ball, just a ball, ball

[Outro]
When love is free
