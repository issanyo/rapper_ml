[Hook]
Work hard, play hard (x4)
Work (x8)

[Verse 1]
What do you know rockin'?
Pound you with the knowledge
Rattle with my capital
Swear I went to college
Swear I went uni
Swear I wen't to state
Let the tunes beat
Linguini on my plate
Keep my mouth shut
Never ever say
Keep you confused
And wondering bout my game
My flame, I stay my flow is straight
I aim, to play
I kill it when I hit em
With the little bit of venom from
My fangs
You try to slide, but careen and collide with
My train
My music strange
I keep my flow gold
That spice old
That spring cold
My necklace sold
I reap the souls
I reap the deals
I keep it real
I need the feel
I need the rush
I need the love
I feel spent
Can't pay rent
I need cash
I need cents
I'll save up
It'll waste us
I wish I
Could save us
But I can't and
We'll deal with this
Pass that bridge when
We come to it
Till then I keep these beats fit

[Hook (x2)]
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
The quicker you here, the faster you go
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..

[Verse 2]
I work hard for a dollar and I keep the change
I got heart, but I'm more costly than all the bills I pay
And that's a lot, I got it shocked up in my socket
Gotta get it, gotta lock it, in to rock it, better stock it
See I'm Narrasistic
Hard to grip
The mic when I am on a roll
I'm ill, you see
I'm killing trolls
I hang them up on wooden polls
Parade around the bar and know
I'm coming for you idiots
Just for the lines you straight up stole!
