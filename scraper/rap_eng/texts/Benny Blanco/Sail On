[Verse 1]
I took your hand and held it in my clutch
But it was never mine to hold
You're loving something of a Midas touch
The ones you need, you turn to stone

[Chorus]
Well, sail on
Sail on 'till you're gone
And then some
With all your broken pieces, pieces
Well, sail on
Sail on 'till you're gone
And then some
With all your broken pieces, pieces

[Verse 2]
And now you're spewing out those lonely lies
You say you've changed it all around
But you'll be gone again
When the winds blow, oh sailor
Another state to claim with your flag upon the ground

[Chorus]
Well, sail on
Sail on 'till you're gone
And then some
With all your broken pieces, pieces
Well, sail on
Sail on 'till you're gone
And then some
With all your broken pieces, pieces

[Bridge]
We'll shatter the light, and let it go
Whatever time it'll take to break it
Burning out bright
And sounding the sirens

[Breakdown/Outro]
Sail on, sail on, sail on
Sail on, sail on, sail on...
