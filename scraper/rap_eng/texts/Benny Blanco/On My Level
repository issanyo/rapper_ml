Champagne pourin'
Big joint smokin'
Bombay sippin'
No blunt smoking
Bad boy gettin'
Fit and he got some friends with him
Pourin' shots of liquor
'Cause I'm drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in my pictures
Marijuana loud, boys follow like twitter
Bitch, I know you a hater
Don't rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper
High as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passing through
Rollin' doobies up, ya man who we pass 'em to
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool
That's what I have to do

See after drinking champagne all night
Never worry bout a damn thing, y'all might
Bruv I'm on my level, yeah
I'm on my level, yeah
I'm on my level, yeah
I'm on my level, yeah
So let me take one shot to the brain
And order three more shots
I'm going in, bruv
I'm on my level, yeah
I'm on my level, yeah
I'm on my level, yeah
I'm on my level, yeah
