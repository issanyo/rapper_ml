[Intro]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 1]
You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch
I would know
And you overthink, always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Verse 2]
We used to be just like twins
So in sync
The same energy, now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing, now you're plain boring
I should know that you're not gonna change

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Breakdown]
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down

[Chorus]
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really want to stay, no
(You) But you don't really want to go, oh
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
