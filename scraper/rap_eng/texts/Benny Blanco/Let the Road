Let the road take you home and the sun catch your eye
If you don't belong (don't belong) and the world feels too strong
And you're scared of the darkness to come
Oh, hold on, oh, hold on cause love will show all the ways


When the road seems long, let the voices drive you on
Every turn that you make brings you back around
All the chances you make on this battleground
The road will take you home

When it feels like your climbing a mountain
Gravity's pulling you down i know its not easy
Oh, i know its not easy
But just when you're ready to stop, think how it feels at the top
The sun disappears, your the light even in the darkest nights
Because the stars were meant to shine, they shine

When the road seems long (and you can't find your way)
Let the voices drive you on (can you hear what they say)
Every turn that you make brings you back around
All the chances you take on this battleground

The road will take you home
Know the road will take you home
The road will take you home
