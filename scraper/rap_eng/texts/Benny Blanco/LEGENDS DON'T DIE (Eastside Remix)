[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Jxckal remix

[Hook]
Shotgun in the whip, let it, ghost ride
Head out the window screaming, fuck life
Bumping X cos legends don't die
Told you that all my idols is ghosts right?
Shotgun in the whip, let it, ghost ride
Head out the window screaming, fuck life
Bumping X cos legends don't die
Told you that all my idols is ghosts right?

[Verse 1]
My girl wanna talk I got no time
Tryin get out of my mind
Every song I touch is a gold mine
But every person in my life is broke I'm
Sick of the reputation
When I talk about my feelings then I'm faking
Ever since you made these songs you been changing
The only one who understands is vacant

[Hook]
Shotgun in the whip, let it, ghost ride
Head out the window screaming, fuck life
Bumping X cos legends don't die
Told you that all my idols is ghosts right?
Shotgun in the whip, let it, ghost ride
Head out the window screaming, fuck life
Bumping X cos legends don't die
Told you that all my idols is ghosts right?

[Verse 2]
People love the music not the man
Art from the artist is hard to understand
Keep judging the boy cos they don't see the plan
They all think I can't even when they say I can
And I been lying to myself
Say I'm doing good but I ain't feeling well
Yeah I hit the gym but I fuck my mental health
Idols that have passed the only ones that help

[Hook]
Shotgun in the whip, let it, ghost ride
Head out the window screaming, fuck life
Bumping X cos legends don't die
Told you that all my idols is ghosts right?
Shotgun in the whip, let it, ghost ride
Head out the window screaming, fuck life
Bumping X cos legends don't die
Told you that all my idols is ghosts right?

[Verse 3]
So I say RIP to X
RIP to Chester
Legends in my head
Curt Cobain I been living on the edge
Bumping Ed Sheeran still singing I'm a mess
And I ain't know what you expect
Every song I been honest since stepping off the bench
Feel the weight on my shoulders I carry every step
No comparison, nah I ain't nothing like the rest
This city look colder in the summer
Kids gets shanked for they shoes, they ain't running
And all over the news is discussion
Of how Trumps tweet was stupid or something, fuck

[Hook]
Shotgun in the whip, let it, ghost ride
Head out the window screaming, fuck life
Bumping X cos legends don't die
Told you that all my idols is ghosts right?
Shotgun in the whip, let it, ghost ride
Head out the window screaming, fuck life
Bumping X cos legends don't die
Told you that all my idols is ghosts right?
