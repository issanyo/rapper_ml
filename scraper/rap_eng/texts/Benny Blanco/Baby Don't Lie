[Intro]
Uh huh
Here we go

[Verse 1]
We been walking down this road for some time
And you love, and you love me good, no lie
But there's somethin' behind those eyes, those eyes
That you can't, that you can't disguise, disguise

[Chorus]
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I don't wanna cry no longer
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I'mma need a love that's stronger
Until you know, until you know, until you know why, know why
If we ever give up, then we're gonna die
Look me in the eye
Baby don't lie
Baby don't lie

[Verse 2]
We been walkin' down this road for some time
And you love, and you love me good, no lie
But there's something behind those eyes, those eyes
That you can't, that you can't disguise, disguise

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby tell me there's nothing below
Baby tell me there's nothing below
Here we, here we
Come on

[Chorus]
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I don't wanna cry no longer
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I'mma need a love that's stronger
Until you know, until you know, until you know why, know why
If we ever give up, then we're gonna die
Look me in the eye
Baby don't lie
Baby don't lie

[Bridge]
Whatcha hiding boy
Whatcha hiding boy
I can tell whatcha been hiding boy
And you can tell me if I'm getting warm
Am I getting warm?
Am I getting warm?
Am I getting warm?
And you can tell me if I'm getting warm

[Chorus]
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I don't wanna cry no longer
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie
I'mma need a love that's stronger
Until you know, until you know, until you know why, know why
If we ever give up, then we're gonna die
Look me in the eye
Baby don't lie
Baby don't lie
