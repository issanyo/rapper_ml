[Bridge: Sean Foreman & Ke$ha]
My first kiss went a little like this
And twist and twist
Well, my first kiss went a little like this
And twist and twist

[Verse 1: Sean Foreman]
I said no more teachers and no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers, hoping that nobody looks
Lips like liquorice, tongue like candy
Excuse me miss, but can I get you out your panties?

[Pre-Chorus: Nathaniel Motte]
In the back of the car, on the way to the bar
I got you on my lips (I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs with my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

[Chorus: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....
Ooooooh...
She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....
Ooooooh...

[Pre-Verse: Ke$ha]
My first kiss went a little like this

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman]
I said no more sailors and no more soldiers
With your name in a heart tattooed upon their shoulders
Kisses like whiskey, it gets me drunk
And I wake up in the morning with the taste of your tongue

[Pre-Chorus: Nathaniel Motte]
In the back of the car, on the way to the bar
I got you on my lips (I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs with my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

[Chorus: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....
Ooooooh...
She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way you know that I'd make her say
Ooooooh....
Ooooooh...

[Bridge: Sean Foreman & Ke$ha]
My first kiss went a little like this
And twist and twist
Well, my first kiss went a little like this
And twist and twist

[Build: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
[She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way you know that I'd make her say
