[Verse 1]
No one can tell me
That you were right for me girl
You coulda told me
To run a lap around the world

[Pre-Chorus]
All that time I was hypnotized
While you uh behind my back
Now my mind keeps me up all night
Why'd you have to say bye like that?

[Hook]
I shoulda cheated on you (ah-ooh)
I was everything you wanted and more
I shoulda cheated on you (ah-ooh)
Nobody told me I was dating a whore
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated

[Verse 2]
My friends shoulda told me
You weren't the one for me girl (you weren't the one for me girl)
Cause you almost sold me
I bought a rock for you girl (I bought a rock)

[Pre-Chorus]
All that time I was hypnotized
While you uh behind my back
Now my mind keeps me up all night
Why'd you have to say bye like that?

[Hook]
I shoulda cheated on you (ah-ooh)
I was everything you wanted and more
I shoulda cheated on you (ah-ooh)
Nobody told me I was dating a whore
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated (ah-ooh)

[Bridge]
Liar, liar, hey girl
You gon' tell all your friends
That I'm talking about you
I'm talking about you
You gon' tell, you gon' tell
All your friends
That I'm talking about you
I'm talking about you
I'm talking about you

This song is for you

[Hook]
I shoulda cheated on you
I was everything you wanted and more
I shoulda cheated on you
Nobody told me I was dating a whore
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated on you
