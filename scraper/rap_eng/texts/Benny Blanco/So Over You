[Intro]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?

[Verse 1]
Just a little girl on the TV screen
Stuck inside a silver cage
Body tangled up in chains
I'm looking for the light in the misery
All this love is doomed to pain
Everyday, I feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
My tears, they cried like a waterfall in the light
My roses don't bloom since you left me blue
You've got to stop
Tryna mess around with my heart
It's true, I'm through, flying with you

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
I promise, baby, that you will never forget me

[Verse 2]
Tryna fly away, tryna spread my wings
Soaring like a golden bird
Blocking out the things I heard
97 girls on your cameraphone
Secrets kinda suck to burn
Wish I coulda heard it from you first (ha ha ha ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
My tears, they cried like a waterfall in the light
My roses don't bloom since you left me blue
You've got to stop
Tryna mess around with my heart
It's true, I'm through, flying with you

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
I promise, baby, that you will never forget me

[Bridge]
Saw you at the party with everybody
You look so lonely when you're on your own
I know we both remember hanging together
We were so happy
Now we're moving on

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
I promise, baby, that you will never forget me

[Outro]
Saw you at the party with everybody
You look so lonely when you're on your own
