[Intro] (x2)
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love

[Verse 1]
Took the plane at five
Flew across the world, I'm the other girl
The one who's in your head
Laid there by your side
In the city nights, naked in the lights
Hiding secrets in your bed

[Chorus]
Coz we tried to turn around, but we can't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind
Push restart, press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love

[Verse 2]
Lost inside the line
Stare across the room, almost fallin' through
Never make the same mistake
Harder every time
Wish we could be true, always wantin' you
We gotta stay a mystery
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
(Coz we)
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
(Coz we)
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
(Coz we)
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love...
