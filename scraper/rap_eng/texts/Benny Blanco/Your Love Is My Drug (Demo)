Maybe I need some rehab or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession, I'm seein' it in my dreams
I'm lookin' down every alley, I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin', hittin' my head against the wall

What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Mom's tellin' me I should think twice
But left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgement's gettin' kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a love sick crackhead

What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave
Hey so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum
Is my love your drug
Your drug
Huh, your drug
Huh, your drug
Is my love your drug

Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Hey, hey, so
Your love, your love, your love, your love is my drug
I like your beard
