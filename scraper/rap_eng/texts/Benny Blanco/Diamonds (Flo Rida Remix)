[Intro: Flo Rida]
Flo Rida (Flo Rida)
Bad girl Ri-Ri (Rihanna)
Diamonds remix (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
That VBS stone that flawless rock
Invisible Swiss scaterred all in my watch. (Watch)
I’m looking for a girl to watch his princes cuss (Cuss)
In the nation so she already know what’s up! (What’s up)

Diamonds in the sky shine all bright (Bright)
She’s as peace in the club
Shine all night (Night)
I’m guessing Barbados
Colours in the rings
I flow, she sings

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
Baby you’re a diamond
Shining
No silver in the lining
I am
Well I am
I’m a man on assignment

For you I know you can handle the sky-y
Hope you can manage to handle a Rida
Diamonds baby diamonds, no blows
Lights camera action shows blondes

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Find light in he beauiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We’re like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I’m alive
We’re like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Hook: Rihanna]
I knew that we’d become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sigh I left the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

[Hook]
So shine bright, tonight you and I
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Post-Hook]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we’ll never die
We’re like diamonds in the sky

You’re a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I’m alive
We’re like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Hook: Rihanna]
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
