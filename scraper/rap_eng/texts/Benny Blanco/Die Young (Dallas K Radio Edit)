[Intro]
Die young

[Chorus]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
(We're gonna die young)
Die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
