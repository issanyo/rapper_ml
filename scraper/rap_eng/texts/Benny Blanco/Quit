[Verse 1]
You sit battling the devil you know
And I don't disagree
No, I don't see the harm
They say: "You're crazy, just leave him he'll suffocate you,"
But I wanna be in your arms

[Verse 2]
They say: "No, don't pick up the phone, let them think there's nobody home."
But I'm under your spell
Cause when you call my heart starts to grow
I always want more, It's my heaven, my hell

[Pre-Chorus]
But here in deep inside lives a voice, a voice so quiet
But I can hear the voice when your heartbeat's next to mine

[Chorus]
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
