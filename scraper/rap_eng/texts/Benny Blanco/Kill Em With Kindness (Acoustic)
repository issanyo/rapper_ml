[Verse 1]
The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
See we don’t have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with

[Chorus]
And kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead now

[Verse 2]
We’re running out of time, chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
There's always somebody
You’re willing to fight to be right

[Pre-Chorus]
Your lies are bullets, your mouth's a gun
No war in anger was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

[Chorus]
Please, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead now

[Pre-Chorus]
Your lies are bullets, your mouth's a gun
No war in anger was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Why can't we stop fighting?

[Chorus]
And kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead now
