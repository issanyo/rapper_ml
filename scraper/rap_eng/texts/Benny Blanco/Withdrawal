[Verse 1]
These walls around me start to bend
And I'm with her again
Intoxication
This is intoxication

I'm swerving down this road, my friend
Tell me, where does it end
Intoxication
This is intoxication

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been feeling low (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
And I got to know (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Can you pick me up (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Cause it's oh so hard

[Chorus]
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
And it's oh so hard

I'm waiting on your phone call, baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
And it's oh so hard

[Verse 2]
The smoke is flowing like her hair
Breathe it in if you dare
Intoxication
This is intoxication

I'm going down just like a pill
And I'm getting my fill
Because I hate to waste them
Intoxication

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been feeling low (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
And I got to know (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Can you pick me up (hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Cause it's oh so hard

[Chorus]
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
And it's oh so hard

I'm waiting on your phone call, baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
And it's oh so hard

[Bridge]
Shake, shake, sha-shaking
You got me
Shake, shake, sha-shaking, yeah
Shake, shake, sha-shaking
You got me
Shake, shake, sha-shaking

[Chorus]
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
And it's oh so hard

I'm waiting on your phone call, baby
I gotta know if you're gonna save me
I'm shaking from the withdrawal, baby
And it's oh so hard
