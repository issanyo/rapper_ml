[Intro: Rihanna & (Eve)]
Shine bright like a diamond
(C'mon)
Shine bright like a diamond
(Yeah)

[Verse 1: Eve]
AYo
You glisten so beautiful, priceless
Listen to me, I need you to know (know)
How you can change my whole world
New life, new love, I'm a new girl (new girl)
Guess you did what they coudn't
Stayed when I pushed away and they wouldn't
Said "trust" and I thought I shouldn't
Carved your initials in my heart like wood and (and)
Now I'm floating through air
Brightest in the whole sky, we both there (there)
Freedom in the universe, now it's so clear (clear)
I waited a lifetime, now you right here (right here)
And I'm never gonna give it up
Shinning like a million spot lights, live it up
Blinding, diamonds, forever that's us
And I can never get enough
Yup

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

[Chorus: Rihanna]
So shine bright, tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye
So alive
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

[Chorus: Rihanna]
So shine bright, tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye
So alive
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

[Chorus: Rihanna]
So shine bright, tonight
You and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye
So alive
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky

[Outro: Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Oh-oh, yeah
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
