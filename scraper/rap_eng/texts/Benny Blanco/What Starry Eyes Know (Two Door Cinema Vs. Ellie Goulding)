[Chorus]
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone

[Verse 1]
Handle bars, and then I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one

[Pre]
Next thing we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning
Hit me with lightning,  hit me with lightning
Hit me with lightning, hit me with lightning

[Chorus]
I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

[Verse 2]
So we burst into colours, colours and carousels
Fall head first like paper planes in playground games

[Pre]
Next thing we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning
Hit me with lightning,  hit me with lightning
Hit me with lightning, hit me with lightning

[Chorus]
I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

[Breakdown]

[Chorus]
I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time
