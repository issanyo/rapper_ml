[Verse 1]
Yo, dreams we all have em
Wake up in the morning
Still in my pijamas
Roll up to the game
Hotter than the sauna
I was maybe

Focused to the bone
Thought I use some
Had a few phases
Scrappin up my past
I got different things to make
Got my squad in this in this huddle man these haters bout to struggle

[Hook]
I got all the time that I need, ya, ya
Listing to Panda got me beep, ya, ya, ya
Pencil in my hand, I'm the man, ya, ya, ya
Red and green, number nineteen, ya, ya, ya

[Verse 2]
I'm going to the life that I dreamed up for myself
It's been a long road, a long fight that's taken toll on my health
People try to stop me
People stop and stare
People don't really see we should all follow dreams that's fair

Dreams, dreams, dreams, yeah
They are good for your heart
The more that you love it
The sooner you'll start it
Ain't never gonna stop me from making this art
I gotta be on point, like I'm a dart

[Verse 3]
Ultra light beams
Seven inch inseam
They call us magic because we are a dream team
They call us lactose cause we are a cream team
We wearin' short shorts that'll make our knees seen
Breathing in and out we havin dreams in large amounts
We love our friends and we love our spouse
We full a' dreams and we don't run out

[Chorus]
I've got a power in me
Stronger than electricity
I gotta dream in me
That I'm gonna achieve
My momma told me
In what to believe
They wanna stop me
In what I believe

[Verse 4]
Haters gonna hate
And Lovers gonna love
Ignoring what they say
And what they deprive me of
I fly past you like I'm dove
I'm just doing me
That's what I love

[Chorus x3]
I've got a power in me
Stronger than electricity
I gotta dream in me
That I'm gonna achieve
My momma told me
In what to believe
They wanna stop me
In what I believe
