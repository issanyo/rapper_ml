[Verse 1]
All the times that you rained on my parade
All the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh boy, for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

[Pre-Chorus]
But you still hit my phone up, phone up, phone up
You still hit my phone up, phone up, phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on, movin' on, movin' on
And I think it should be somethin'
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I know, I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna hold back, hold back, hold back
Maybe you should know that, know that, know that
I don't wanna hold back, hold back, hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I know, I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

[Bridge]
Sleeping on my own
Sleeping on my own
Sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Outro]
You should go and love yourself
