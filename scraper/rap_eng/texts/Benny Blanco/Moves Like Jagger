[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars, if it feels right
Then aim for my heart, if you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now we're naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them mooooooves like Jagger
I don't needa try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moooooooves like Jagger

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Baby, it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car, you can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And it goes like this

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Christina Aguilera]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them mooooooves like Jagger
I don't needa try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moooooooves like Jagger
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera & Adam Levine]
You wanna know, how to make me smile?
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right, yeah
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
And it goes like this

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them mooooooves like Jagger
I don't needa try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moooooooves like Jagger
