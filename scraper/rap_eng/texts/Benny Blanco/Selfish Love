[Verse 1]
Baby let's be honest about this
There's only room for one in your heart
So tell me darlin', why are we like this?
I must admit that I kind of like it

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you're acting sweet
I know what that means
All these games we play
Always end the same

[Chorus]
Selfish love, why do I do these things?
I break you down, just to get my way
Selfish love, darlin' you do it too
You tell me lies and I bend the truth
And I, I know
That I can't get enough
Selfish love

[Verse 2]
Baby now it feels like we're dancing
Dodging bullets, now ain't that romantic?
Take what I want, but you want me to take it
I only give love when I want to make it

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you're acting sweet
I know what that means
All these games we play
Always end the same

[Chorus]
Selfish love, why do I do these things?
I break you down, just to get my way
Selfish love, darlin' you do it too
You tell me lies and I bend the truth
And I, I know
That I can't get enough
Selfish love
Selfish love
Selfish love

[Bridge]
Oh, you're acting sweet
And I know what that means
Selfish love
Oh, you're acting sweet
And I know what means

[Outro]
Selfish love
Selfish love
Selfish love
Selfish love

Selfish love
Selfish love
Selfish love
Selfish love
