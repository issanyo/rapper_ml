[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Verse 1: Ke$ha]
I see ya in the club showing Ke$ha love
Ain't trippin' on them bitches that be hatin'
Catch a dub, chuck a deuces
Y'all hatin's useless, it's such a nuisance
Y'all chickens keep your two cents
And keep your dollars, keep your loot, I'm fresher than that Gucci
Them boys, they want my coochie, I say "Nope, I'm no hoochie"
Your homegirl hatin', I say "Who she?"
Ke$ha don't give two fucks, I came to start the ruckus
And ya wanna party with us cause we crazy motherfuckas

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
I'm buzzin' off these bubbles, I sip and then I guzzle
I'm the nigga that says mazel tov, I bring the trouble
If they don't have no alcohol, then I'm gonna smuggle
Some Ros√©, Chandon, drink 'til I see double
She put boobies in my face, and now I'm really seeing doubles
I took her to my place to blast off like a shuttle, wait
Kissing while we talkin', so I'm speaking with a mumble
Ehbludebleebudebuebludebiblumble

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Bridge: Ke$ha]
This is all we've got and then it's gone
You call us the crazy ones
But we gon' keep on dancing till the dawn
Cause you know the party never ends
And tomorrow we gonna do it again
We the ones that play hard
We live hard, we love hard
We light up the dark

[Chorus: Ke$ha]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people
