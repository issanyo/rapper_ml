Brittany with the Cheerios:
D-I-N-O-S-A, you are a dinosaur
D-I-N-O-S-A, you are a dinosaur
O-L-D-M-A-N, you're just an old man
Hitting on me, what? You need a CAT scan

The Cheerios:
Hahahahahahaha...

Brittany (with The Cheerios):
(Old man), why are you starin' at me?
Mack on me and my friends (it's kinda creepy)
You should be prowling around the old folks' home (The Cheerios: Oh!)
Come on, dude, (leave us alone)
At first we thought that it was kind of ill when
We saw that you were like a billion
And still out tryin' to make a killin'

Brittany with the Cheerios:
Get back to the museum

D-I-N-O-S-A, you are a dinosaur
D-I-N-O-S-A, you are a dinosaur
O-L-D-M-A-N, you're just an old man
Hitting on me, WHAT? You need a CAT scan

Brittany (with The Cheerios):
Hey, dinosaur, baby you're prehistoric
Hey, dinosaur, (That's what you are, ha!)
Hey, carnivore
You want my meat
I know it, hey, dinosaur
(That's what you are, ha!)

Brittany:
Yeah, you're pretty old

The Cheerios:
Hahahahahahaha... (Brittany: Hahaha...)

Brittany (with the Cheerios):
Not long (The Cheerios: Nanana) 'til you're a senior citizen
And you can strut around with that (sexy) tank of oxygen
(Honey), your toupee is falling to your left side

Brittany with the Cheerios:
Get up and go, bro, oh wait

Brittany (with the Cheerios):
You're fossilized, (ha!)
You sit down, buy me a martini
Won't (go away), my hints aren't sinking

Brittany (The Cheerios):
("Hey"), you say, ("Wanna come with me?")

Brittany with the Cheerios:
I'm about to barf, seriously? (The Cheerios: seriously!)

D-I-N-O-S-A, you are a dinosaur
D-I-N-O-S-A, you are a dinosaur
O-L-D M-A-N, you're just an old man
Hitting on me, what? You need a CAT scan

Brittany (with The Cheerios):
Hey, dinosaur, baby you're prehistoric
Hey, dinosaur, (That's what you are, ha!)
Hey, carnivore
You want my meat
I know it, hey, dinosaur
(That's what you are, ha!)

Hey, dinosaur, baby you're prehistoric
Hey, dinosaur, (That's what you are, ha!)
Hey, carnivore
You want my meat
I know it, hey, dinosaur
(That's what you are, ha!)

Brittany with the Cheerios:
D-I-N-O-S-A, you are a dinosaur
D-I-N-O-S-A that's what you are, ha!
D-I-N-O-S-A, you are a dinosaur
D-I-N-O-S-A that's what you are, ha!
