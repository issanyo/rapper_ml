[Verse 1]
Swimming pool, limousines (c'mon, let's do it)
C'mon, let's cause a scene (c'mon, let's do it)
Cigar in the caviar (c'mon, let's do it)
Pissing in the Dom Perignon (c'mon, let's do it now)
C'mon, let's do it
We gonna do it now
C'mon, on let's do it
C'mon, on let's do this!

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh
There's a party at a rich dude's house
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh
There's a party at a rich dude's house
If you wanna go, then you know
We're gonna fight 'til we do it right
So let's, whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh
Tonight

[Interlude]
De-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Da-nah-nah-nah-nah!

[Verse 2]
No, we're not on the list (c'mon, let's do it)
No, we don't give a shit (c'mon, let's do it)
Dance 'til your pants come off (c'mon, get naked)
Party 'til the break of dawn (c'mon, let's do it now)
C'mon, let's do it (c'mon, c'mon)
C'mon, let's do this!

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh
There's a party at a rich dude's house
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh
There's a party at a rich dude's house
If you wanna go, then you know
We're gonna fight 'til we do it right
So let's, whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh
Tonight

[Bridge]
Wake up in the front yard, we don't care
Wine stain on the sofa, we don't care
I threw up in the closet, but I don't care
'Cause we're young and we're broke
And I can't find my coat
And the sun is coming up
And oh my God, I think I'm still drunk

[Break]
Whew!
Where's my coat?
Where?!

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh
There's a party at a rich dude's house
Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh
There's a party at a rich dude's house
If you wanna go, then you know
We're gonna fight 'til we do it right
So let's, whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh
Tonight
