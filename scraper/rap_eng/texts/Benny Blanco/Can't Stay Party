[Verse 1]
Baby's saying "Come on, take me out"
Didn't know what to think about it
Come on, she said, take me out
And oh we go through it
Through all this pain, temptation sang
Don't do the thing in your heart
Now I'm looking for, looking for another one
So I assume from the start

[Chorus]
Hey, what are we gonna do?
Hey, can't stay for another one
Can't stay for another one
Can't stay for another one
Can't stay for it, can't wait for it
Okay just another one

[Verse 2]
Compensating everybody out there
And how they think about things
That everybody knows isn't true
Well look at this young man
Gonna make his year
You're gonna make his year
Do you know what to do?

[Chorus]
Hey, what are we gonna do?
Hey, you wanna party
Hey, what are we supposed to do?
Hey, can't stay for another one
Can't stay for another one
Can't stay for another one
Can't stay for it, can't wait for it
Okay just another one
