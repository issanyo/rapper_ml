[Chorus]
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's time to kill the lights and shut the DJ down
Tonight we're taking over, no one's getting out

[Chorus]
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow

[Verse 1]
Back door cracked, we don't need a key
We get in for free
No VIP sleaze
Drink that Kool-Aid, follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're coming with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's time to lose your mind and let the crazy out
(This place about to)
Tonight we're takin' names, 'cause we don't mess around
Dance

[Chorus]
This place about to
This place about to
This place about to
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Bridge]
Go-go-go-go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes
Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes

[Interlude]
We are taking over
Get used to it, okay?

[Chorus]
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow
Blow

[Outro]
Blow
