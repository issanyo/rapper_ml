[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying, on my own well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I've been movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, baby you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's goin' on
And now I know, I should be sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I've been movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, baby you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's goin' on
And now I know, I should be sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da da-da, da-da da
Da-da da-da, da-da da
Da-da da-da, da-da, da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da, da-da da
Da-da da-da, da-da da
Da-da da-da, da-da da-da da

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Then baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
