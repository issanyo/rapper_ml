[Verse 1]
And now I see technicolor
A movie script lover
You chase me while I play the clown, oh
But then you know, oh

[Verse 2]
I tend to stack the deck with wild cards
You're betting all you got on a broken heart
I say don't, oh
But now you know, oh

[Chorus]
So I curse my stars for a fair game
While you nurse my scars and the old flame
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for
You, you, I'm a f-, you, you, I'm a f-
If I let you down like I tend to
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool

[Verse 3]
And now I see shades of roses
Your love, I suppose, is an ocean
The ebb and the flow, oh
An undertow, oh

[Verse 4]
But I can feel the rogue inside my veins
The waves that crash the castle we made of sand
Oh, I ho-ope
It doesn't show, oh

[Chorus]
So I curse my stars for a fair game
While you nurse my scars and the old flame
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for
You, you, I'm a f-, you, you, I'm a f-
If I let you down like I tend to
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool

[Bridge]
Old dog, new treat, a shorter leash
I cannot breathe, I lock the door
You flood the gate, tick, tick, too late
But still, you know, I'm a fool for-
Oh-oh, you-oh, you
I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for
I'm a fool for
You

[Outro]
I'm a f-
(You, you)
I'm a f-
(You, you)
I'm a f-
(You, you)
I'm a f-
(You, you)
I'm a f-
(You, you)
I'm a f-
(You, you)
I'm a f-
(You, you)
