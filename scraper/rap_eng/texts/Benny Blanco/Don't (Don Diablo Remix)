Ah- la-la-la-la-la
I met this girl, i late last year
She said dont you worry if I disappear
I told her Im not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend
Thinking that the trouble would wait
But then, I jump right in a week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause
Until the moment was right
I went away for months
Until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We´ll be in between the sheets until the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should´ve just said
Shes singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
For a couple weeks i
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I dont want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what its about
But maybe well go together and just figure it out
Id rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane or well be missing it now
Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out
When she was kissing him How?!
I was confused about
She should figure it out while Im sat here singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
*Knock, knock, knock* on my hotel door
I dont even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed thats all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun
And I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize
What you wanted
Its a bit too much, too late if Im honest
All this time God knows Im singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
