[Verse 1]
Break down
Break down
Break down
I was scared to death I was losing my mind
Break down
I couldn’t close my eyes I was pacing all night
Oh no, I think I found the light at the end of the tunnel
And my doubts
I couldn’t find the truth I was going under

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won’t hide inside
I gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out
Lonely inside and light the fuse
Light it now, light it now, light it now

[Chorus]
And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I’ll fly like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball

[Verse 2]
Freedom
I let go of fear and the peace came quickly
Freedom
I was in the dark and then it hit me
I chose suffering and pain in the falling rain
I know, I gotta get out into the world again

[Pre-Chorus]
But I won’t hide inside
I gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out
Lonely inside and light the fuse
Light it now, light it now, light it now

[Chorus]
And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I’ll fly like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball

[Bridge]
Break down
I was scared to death I was losing my mind
Break it down
I gotta get out into the world again

[Chorus]
And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I’ll fly like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball

[Outro]
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball
