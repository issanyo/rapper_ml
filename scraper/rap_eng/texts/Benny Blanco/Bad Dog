[Verse 1]
I just found out that I'm fuckin' with a bad dog
But the beast in me, she know how to train a bad dog (Woof!)
Like a bad dog, sit and be a good dog
Or Imma put you down (Bang, bang)
Like a bad dog

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm breathin' on your skin
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
You feel me closin' in
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh-

[Chorus]
You're just an animal that I caught
And you know I'm yours so rip my clothes off
And it's like oh, oh
And then we oh, oh
Just come inside my cage, you bad dog
You're just an animal that I caught
And you know I'm yours so rip my clothes off
And it's like oh, oh
And then we oh, oh
Just come inside my cage, you bad dog

[Verse 2]
Keep you on a leash, tie you up like a bad dog
Taste me on your teeth when you bite like a bad dog (Woof!)
Like a bad dog
Beg and be a good dog
Or Imma put you down (Bang, bang)
Like a mad dog

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm breathin' on your skin
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
You feel me closin' in
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
You're just an animal that I caught
And you know I'm yours so rip my clothes off
And it's like oh, oh
And then we oh, oh
Just come inside my cage, you bad dog
You're just an animal that I caught
And you know I'm yours so rip my clothes off
And it's like oh, oh
And then we oh, oh
Just come inside my cage, you bad dog

[Bridge]
Revenge is sweet like licorice
I poison you with just a kiss
A kiss, a kiss
You're just an animal that I caught
Your hands are tied, I got my wish
So say a prayer 'cause this is it
Is it, is it

[Chorus]
You're just an animal that I caught
And you know I'm yours so rip my clothes off
And it's like oh, oh
And then we oh, oh
Just come inside my cage, you bad dog
You're just an animal that I caught
And you know I'm yours so rip my clothes off
And it's like oh, oh
And then we oh, oh
Just come inside my cage, you bad dog
