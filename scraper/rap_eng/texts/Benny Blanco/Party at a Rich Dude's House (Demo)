Swimmin' pool limousine
Come on let's do it
Come on let's cause a scene
Come on let's do it
Cigar in the caviar
Come on let's do it
Pissin' in the Dom PÃ©rignon
Come on let's do it now
Come on let's do it
We gotta do it now
Come on let's do it
C'mon let's do this

Whoa there's a party at a rich dude's house
Whoa there's a party at a rich dude's house
If you wanna go
Then you know
We're gonna fight
'Til we do it right
So let's whoa tonight

De nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
De nah, nah, nah, nah

No we're not on the list
Come on let's do it
No we don't give a shit
Come on let's do it
Dance 'til your pants come off
Come on get naked
Party 'til the break of dawn
Come on let's do it now
Come on let's do it
Come on let's do this

Whoa there's a party at a rich dude's house
Whoa there's a party at a rich dude's house
If you wanna go
Then you know
We're gonna fight
'Til we do it right
So let's whoa tonight

Wake up in the front yard we don't care
Wine stain on the sofa we don't care
I threw up in the closet but I don't care
'Cause we're young and we're broke
And I can't find my coat
And the sun is comin' up
And oh my God I think I'm still fucked up (where's my coat)

There's a party at a rich dude's house
There's a party at a rich dude's house
If you wanna go
Then you know
We're gonna fight
'Til we do it right
So let's whoa

There's a party at a rich dude's house
Whoa there's a party at a rich dude's house
If you wanna go
Then you know
We're gonna fight
'Til we do it right
So let's whoa tonight
