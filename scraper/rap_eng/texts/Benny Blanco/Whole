[Intro]
Whole, whole, whole, whole

[Verse 1]
When you wake up and you find that I'm not there
Cry for me
Put on your makeup and just let down your hair
Don't lose sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you said we're fine, but I'm not sold
You try to take two halves and make them whole

[Chorus]
And make them whole
And make them whole
And make them whole
And make them whole
And make them whole

[Bridge]
Make them whole, make them whole

[Verse 2]
When I wake up and I reach across the bed
You're not there
Tried to save us, but no one ever said
Love was fair

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you said we're fine, but I'm not sold
You try to take two halves and make them whole

[Chorus]
And make them whole
And make them whole
And make them whole
And make them whole
And make them whole

[Verse 3]
I know you say you're fine, but I'm not here to say goodbye
I'm sick of wastin' all this time when we both know, yeah
Life can move so fast I know we run in different paths
But can we try to take two halves and make them whole?

[Chorus]
And make them whole
And make them whole
And make them whole
And make them whole
And make them whole
