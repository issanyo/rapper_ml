[Chorus]
Diamonds 'round my neck, they just got bigger
I'ma need two lanes, my whip just got bigger
Shawty hit my line, I pull up, come and get her
She just wanna kick it with a nigga
Lately I've been stackin' up them figures
She see that my pockets gettin' bigger
Fuckin' on your bitch, she say I'm bigger
Rollin' out an ounce, my Backwood bigger

[Verse 1]
You go big, we go bigger, yeah
Fuckin' that bitch on the first night, she wanna see how I live
She wanna come to the crib, you cannot hang with the big dawgs
Gang, gang, gang, gang, spend me a check when I'm pissed off
Money comin' in, I'm walkin' with ten
Skrrt off in the Benz, you can bring a friend
That's a triple threat, sit back, collect check
Double cup of Tech, my bitch love to flex

[Chorus]
Diamonds 'round my neck, they just got bigger
I'ma need two lanes, my whip just got bigger
Shawty hit my line, I pull up, come and get her
She just wanna kick it with a nigga
Lately I've been stackin' up them figures
She see that my pockets gettin' bigger
Fuckin' on your bitch, she say I'm bigger
Rollin' out an ounce, my Backwood bigger (drip!)

[Verse 2]
Everything I do get bigger, I see cameras everywhere
When I'm in L.A., lot of OG in the air
New Balenciagas, every color, every pair
Diamonds shine, chandelier, you can't help but stare
I done spent a cool 100 just to dress up in the latest
Pull up on my ex bitch, make her swallow all my babies
It feel amazin', then I get back to the basics, yeah
In love with faces so them Benjamins I'm chasin'

[Chorus]
Diamonds 'round my neck, they just got bigger
I'ma need two lanes, my whip just got bigger
Shawty hit my line, I pull up, come and get her
She just wanna kick it with a nigga
Lately I've been stackin' up them figures
She see that my pockets gettin' bigger
Fuckin' on your bitch, she say I'm bigger
Rollin' out an ounce, my Backwood bigger
