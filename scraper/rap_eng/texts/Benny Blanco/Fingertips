We were running from the waves on the shallows
Trying to keep ourselves alone and out of sight
All right, all right, all right
You were talking about the night when I cashed out
Traded glances as I stole your lovers light
All right, all right, all right
Thatâ€™s how I recall it and you were like

I remember it, it was a night just like this
One of those moments that just slip
But you just feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah
And I remember it, it was a late summer bliss
One of those moments that just slip
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah

And I remember you, you were first on my list
One of those moments that just slip
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah
I remember us, you were a late summer bliss
One of those moments that just slips
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah

We were drinking from the same old glasses
That we borrowed from my roommate down the hall, hall, hall
Down the hall and you were like
I remember it, it was a night just like this
One of those moments that just slip
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah
And I remember it, it was a late summer bliss
One of those moments that just slip
But you feel it from your heart to your fingertips, yeah
