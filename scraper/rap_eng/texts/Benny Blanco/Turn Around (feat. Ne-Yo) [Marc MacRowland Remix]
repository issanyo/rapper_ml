Turn around, open your eyes, look at me now
Turn around, girl, I've got you, we won't fall down
Yeah, we can see forever from up here, here
So long as we're together have no fear, no fear

So turn around, floating so high
Up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now, listen, baby

Turn around, floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now
Turn around, turn around

Turn around, outer space, we can go there now, yeah, ooh
Turn around, there's no limit to what we've found, ooh, yeah
Music up, I wanna feel it all and baby, we'll stay up
'Cause there's no way for us to fall, to fall

So turn around, floating so high
Up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now, listen, baby

Turn around, floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now
Turn around, turn around

Ooh, baby, we're so high now
Tell our worries and our pain goodbye now
Our home is the sky now, oh, yeah, sing it with me
We're coming down, down, down

So turn around, floating so high
Up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now, listen, baby

Turn around, floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now
Turn around, turn around, turn around, nothing can stop us now
