[Intro]
Hard, hard, hard, hard...
Tonight we’re going hard...
We are who we are
We’re dancing like we’re dumb...

[Chorus]
Tonight we’re going hard
Just like the world is ours
We’re tearing it apart
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
We’re dancing like we’re dumb
Our bodies go numb
We’ll be forever young
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are

[Verse 1]
Hot and dangerous
If you’re one of us, then roll with us
'Cause we make the hipsters fall in love
When we’ve got our hot-pants on and up
And yes, of course we does
We’re running this town just like a club
And no, you don’t wanna mess with us
Got Jesus on my necklace

[Pre-Chorus]
Got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexy-fied
So let’s go, oh-oh
Let’s go!

[Chorus]
Tonight we’re going hard
Just like the world is ours
We’re tearing it apart
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
We’re dancing like we’re dumb
Our bodies go numb
We’ll be forever young
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are

[Verse 2]
DJ, turn it up
It’s about damn time to live it up
I’m so sick of being so serious
It’s making my brain delirious
I’m just talking truth
I’m telling you ’bout the shit we do
We’re selling our clothes, sleeping in cars
Dressing it down, hitting on dudes
Hard

[Pre-Chorus]
Got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexy-fied
So let’s go, oh-oh
Let’s go!

[Chorus]
Tonight we’re going hard
Just like the world is ours
We’re tearing it apart
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
We’re dancing like we’re dumb
Our bodies go numb
We’ll be forever young
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are

[Breakdown]
DJ, turn it up
DJ, turn it up
DJ, turn it up
DJ, turn it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexy-fied
So let’s go, oh-oh
Let’s go!

[Chorus]
Tonight we’re going hard
Just like the world is ours
We’re tearing it apart
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
We’re dancing like we’re dumb
Our bodies go numb
We’ll be forever young
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
