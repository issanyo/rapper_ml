[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
Oh boy, I'ma have to call them boys on you
Oh damn, oh damn, I'ma have to call that man on you
Something, something, something must be really wrong with you
Why can't you just tell the fuckin' truth now?
Yes your mama did, she raised a fool, wow
What the fuck did you learn in that schoolhouse?
Chasing girls to chasin' thrills
Takin' pills in the hills, Slauson Hills, Overhills might get you killed
And I won't come 'round them parts no more
Do not run your mouth no more
I can't protect you no more
It's out of my hands for sure

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
You should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Oh, you should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Oh

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
Okay, now you wanna say all that I done to ya
You knew all along that I wasn't the one for you
So let's stop pretending like we were in love
We never shared anything but the drugs
We were both numb, never had anything real between us
You really must
Be smoking that crazy shit, in my city talkin' crazy shit
But you ain't know I'm a crazy bitch
And tell your lawyer that I ain't paying shit
Maybe you should chill, really in your feels
My bros really in the field
Neighborhood is really real and they don't play that here
You shouldn't say that here
You should've made it clear, my dear
You should've called me

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
You should've called me
Why you never call me?
Why you never call me?
Ohh, you should've called me
Why you never call me?
Oh
You, you, you, you
You should've called me
You, you, you, you
Oh, oh
You, you, you, you
You should've called me
You, you, you, you

[Verse 3: YG]
Nigga, don't play
Nigga, nigga, nigga don't play
Nigga, go brazy for tonight
Rob dirty with the .30 for tonight
Pull up on your ass like, hey
Fuck life, catch a case
Suu whoop this, suu whoop that
Nigga, nigga, this Blood Gang, ayy
And when you call her, call her
No, bitch, that's out (that's out)
You callin' lawyers, that's snitch shit, mm-mm, that's out
I'm a L.A. nigga, we do everything for the clout
So we ain't got no problem pullin' up suckin' yo' ass out
6-4 bounce, the flag hang out
Drink a whole fif', smoke a whole ounze
Lookin' like Stacy, off the wood when it's a drought
Thinkin' YG gon' slide, no doubt
I ain't in the middle of no pickin' pussy
But she callin' me 'cause you callin' her
I got shit to do and you workin' her nerve
You tryna get her back 'cause you fuckin' hurt

[Outro: Jhené Aiko & YG]
You, you, you, you
You should've called me
It's over brodie
Sometimes you gotta let shit go
You know on the west side that's how it go
Cry me a river
You, you, you, you
And you know she raisin' a daughter so she gotta get smarter
That's when relationship gets harder, nigga
You, you, you, you
You should've called me
You, you, you, you
