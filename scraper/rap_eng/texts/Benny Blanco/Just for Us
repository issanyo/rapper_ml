[Intro: Francis and the Lights]
My, my, my

[Verse 1: Francis and the Lights]
Someone wanna take you home
Don't let 'em
Even when you're on your own
Everyone's watching
They don't run your life
They don't understand what's good for you
I know you're not scared
That everyone's watching

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
It was just for us
It was just for us

[Verse 2: Francis and the Lights]
Someone wanna run their mouth
Just let 'em
Even though I'm not alone
You're still next to me
They don't run your life
They don't understand what's good for me
I don't feel that bad
If anyone's asking

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
It was just for us
It was just for us

[Verse 3: Francis and the Lights]
When I see you out
And you catch my eye
I wanna look away
But I don't wanna lie
Even though I couldn't explain even if I tried
It was just, it was

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
It was just for us
It was just for us
