[Verse 1]
I'm a red and fragile rose
Won't grow in the dark alone
Take me there 'cause I need to find the light
I hate that I'm scared of this
But you believe, so I'll take the risk
Hold me and tell me I'm alright

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now I'm falling down
You lift me up to the clouds
Yes, I'm falling down
You lift me up, yeah

[Chorus]
You make my hands shake
I watch the glass break
Around my guarded heart tonight
This ain't no mistake
You make my earth quake
You feel like thunder in the sky
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh)
Thunder, thunder, thunder
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh-oh-oh)
You feel like thunder in the sky

[Verse 2]
Broke free, saw an open road
Footsteps lead me to your soul
Now I run with a home to go to
Never thought I'd be this happy
If you're asking, yes, you have me
How you changed my thoughts, you'll never know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So when you're falling down
I'll lift you up to the clouds
Yes, when you're falling down
I'll lift you up, yeah

[Chorus]
You make my hands shake
I watch the glass break
Around my guarded heart tonight
This ain't no mistake
You make my earth quake
You feel like thunder in the sky
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh)
Thunder, thunder, thunder
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh-oh-oh)
You feel like thunder in the sky

[Bridge]
I was broken and starting to think that I should be ashamed
Trembling and nervous, and naked, feeling afraid
Then you came and told me and showed me to fight through the rain
Fight through the rain, to fight through the rain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You make my hands shake (yeah)
I watch the glass break
Around my guarded heart tonight (around my guarded heart tonight)
This ain't no mistake (hey)
You make my earth quake (you make my earth quake)
You feel like thunder in the sky (oh-oh-oh)
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh)
Thunder, thunder, thunder
Like thunder, thunder, thunder (oh-oh-oh-oh)
You feel like thunder in the sky
