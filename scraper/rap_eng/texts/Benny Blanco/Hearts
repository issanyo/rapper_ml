[Verse 1]
Put on a brave face
Act like an earthquake didn't come right in and tear it up
And everything we've built inside this beautiful and safe space
Here in this room where you should be
I'm losing sight of you
A stranger simply passing through again, again, again

[Chorus]
Hearts aren't supposed to hurt like that
They're not supposed to break so fast
They say that time's a healer
How long's this burn supposed to last?

[Verse 2]
Too proud to say it, and I let you leave straight out of spite
And now I'm missing you, sometimes I wish you miss me too
Maybe you do, I'm hoping, but you're too proud to say it too
Maybe I've just been dreaming, dreaming that you'll come right back again, again, again

[Chorus]
Hearts aren't supposed to hurt like that
They're not supposed to break so fast
They say that time's a healer
How long's this burn supposed to last?

[Bridge]
If I could ask a smoking gun, how it feels to hurt someone
I would just ask you
If I could ask someone I love, how it feels to lose someone
I would just ask you
If I could ask a smoking gun, how it feels to hurt someone
I would just ask you
If I could ask someone I love, how it feels to lose someone
I would just ask you

[Chorus]
Hearts aren't supposed to hurt like that
They're not supposed to break so fast
They say that time's a healer
How long's this burn supposed to last?
Hearts aren't supposed to hurt like that
They're not supposed to break so fast
They say that time's a healer
How long's this burn supposed to last?
