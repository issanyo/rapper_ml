[Pre-Chorus]
Let the night come
Dim the lights some
Whisky lemon
Let the time go

[Chorus]
Way slow
Let the records play low
Like the sun goes way low
Lay me down, love
Lay low, oh
Stay low

[Refrain]
Stay low, stay low
Stay low, stay low

[Verse]
Slow day but I passed the time
Coffee and a half a pack
Said I'm thinking about you and I
Took a while but you hit me back
And you know
I get so sick of the telephone
I'll grind, you grind
And then I'll take you home
Tell me if your day was rough
And then you let me make it right
King sized passenger side
Let's ride
Hmm

[Refrain]
Stay low, stay low
Stay low, stay low

Whoah whoah whoah whoah

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the night come
Dim the lights some
Whisky lemon
Let the time go

[Chorus]
Way slow
Let the records play low
Like the sun goes way low
Lay me down, love
Lay low, oh
Stay low

[Refrain]
Stay low, stay low
Stay low, stay low

[Outro]
Slow day but I passed the time
Coffee and a half a pack
Said I'm thinking about you and I
Took a while but you hittin' me back
And you know
And you know
And you know whoo whoo whoo
Stay low
