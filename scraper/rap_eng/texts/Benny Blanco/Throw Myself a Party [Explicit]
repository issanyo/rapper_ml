[Intro: Starrah]
Sip, sip, sip, sip
Yeah, grab my bottle take a big sip (grab my bottle take a big sip)
Sip, sip, sip, sip
Yeah, grab my bottle take a big sip

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Starrah]
I just wanna get drunk, and throw myself a party
I been jugging for some months, tryna throw myself a party
Roll my green up with some blunts, and throw myself a party
Bad bitches turning up, time to throw myself a party
I been working hard, now it's time to go in
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party
Young and livin' large, baby, yeah you know it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz
Another party, 'nother Ferrari
I stretch the truth, like Pilates (true)
See, all of my hoes exotic
None of yo hoes invited
When I meet in her in the lobby, if she ain't fuckin' I leave her in the lobby (yeah)
I fuck the bitch if she pigeon-toed
Usin' my belt for a mistletoe
I used to bet on the telephone
I done made love in the vehicle
This right here, this is yo anthem
Throw a party in the mansion
Throw a party in the trap house
Drink somethin' then pass out
2 Chainz, true

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Starrah]
I just wanna get drunk, and throw myself a party
I been jugging for some months, tryna throw myself a party
Roll my green up with some blunts, and throw myself a party
Bad bitches turning up, time to throw myself a party
I been working hard, now it's time to go in
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party
Young and livin' large, baby, yeah you know it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party

[Verse 2: Starrah]
Twelve months straight, no sleep
Sippin' lean, still no sleep
Party hard till the sun creep
Makin' money, niggas don't sleep
Turn yo bitch into a super freak
Said she only had one drink
Blow her line up, she gon' let the phone ring, ring, ring, ring
(yeah) Callin' all her friends, they want' get it in
Tell em' it's about to get lit, yeah they know it's 'bout to get lit
Twenty bitches on the hit list
I want all her friends, down to get it in
Yeah they know it's 'bout to get lit
Yeah they know it's 'bout to get lit
Grab my bottle take a big sip

[Bridge: Starrah]
Sip, sip, sip, sip
Yeah, grab my bottle take a big sip

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Starrah]
I just wanna get drunk, and throw myself a party
I been jugging for some months, tryna throw myself a party
Roll my green up with some blunts, and throw myself a party
Bad bitches turning up, time to throw myself a party
I been working hard, now it's time to go in
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party
Young and livin' large, baby, yeah you know it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
So tell me am I wrong?
'Cause I think every girl in here just wanna fuck me
Off Patron, spilling what I'm sipping on these Balmain jeans
Maybe we should have a party like where the fuck my bitches tonight?
And where the fuck my liquor tonight?
Tell the waitress "we ain't tippin' 'less she get it right"
So get the liquor, come here shorty
I just wanna get drunk

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Starrah]
I just wanna get drunk, and throw myself a party
I been jugging for some months, tryna throw myself a party
Roll my green up with some blunts, and throw myself a party
Bad bitches turning up, time to throw myself a party
I been working hard, now it's time to go in
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party
Young and livin' large, baby, yeah you know it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party
