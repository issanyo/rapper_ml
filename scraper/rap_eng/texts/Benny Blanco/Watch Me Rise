[Verse 1]
When it's cold out, when the night is still
And you're standing alone
I'll be racing when the lights go out
And you're losing control
Higher, higher, higher we go
Tell me, tell me we're close enough to touch the Sun, the Sun
Higher, higher, higher we go
Tell me, tell me the journey's only just begun, begun

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm still standing, I-I-I-I'm still climbing
Even when the rest are falling, the rest are falling
The rest are falling
I-I-I-I'm still standing, I-I-I-I'm still climbing
Even when the best are falling, the best are falling
The best are falling
You say, say my name
Cause once I get my head above the clouds
I'm never coming down
Say, say my name
Cause once I get my head above the cloudy skies
Watch me rise
Watch me rise

[Verse 2]
Now paranoia's setting in and I'm falling from these stars again
While every part of me screams, "hold on"
Cause if you can't learn to bend then you break
Oh my God, how long does it take?
Every lesson we learned took so long
But it made us strong

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm still standing, I-I-I-I'm still climbing
Even when the rest are falling, the rest are falling
The rest are falling
I-I-I-I'm still standing, I-I-I-I'm still climbing
Even when the best are falling, the best are falling
The best are falling
You say, say my name
Cause once I get my head above the clouds
I'm never coming down
Say, say my name
Cause once I get my head above the cloudy skies
Watch me rise
Above the cloudy skies
Watch me rise
Above the cloudy skies
Watch me rise
Above the cloudy skies
Watch me rise

[Bridge]
Higher, higher, higher we go
Right into the fire we go

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I'm still standing, I-I-I-I'm still climbing
Even when the rest are falling, the rest are falling
The rest are falling
I-I-I-I'm still standing, I-I-I-I'm still climbing
Even when the best are falling, the best are falling
The best are falling
You say, say my name
Cause once I get my head above the clouds
I'm never coming down
Say, say my name
Cause once I get my head above the cloudy skies
Watch me rise
