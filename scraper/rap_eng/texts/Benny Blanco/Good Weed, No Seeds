[Verse 1: Young Korgy]
I’m smoking hella dank, it ain’t got no seeds in it
It’s pretty, full of colors and it’s giving me clear vision
Stony, got the munchies and I’ve got me a clear mission
It’s time to load another bowl, that ashy taste is ichor
I blame it on the sticky green, it’s something like my trigger
When it comes to the marijuana, man I’m always bossing
Hit that bong, go hard, Charles Bronson
I’m a big, fat rapper like Action Bronson
Call me Captain Awesome when the plants-a-blossom
White Widow, crossbreed, Blueberry Kush
Let it grow, let it go, got a Doomberry bush
Take a bong hit, hear the onomatopoeia
Now you got that burning bush something like it’s gonorrhea
In love with lady Mary Jane, now it’s time to see her
Smoking ‘til I’m stupid, I’m toking ‘til I’m lucid
I don’t give a fuck, motherfucker I do this!

[Hook: Young Korgy & Temptationz]
The more that you smoke, the better it gets
You can’t overdose, so keep ripping that shit
The longer you hold it in, the higher you get
That’s why my clique be smoking on that dank everyday (x2)
Good weed, no seeds (x4)
Smoke (x7)

[Verse 2: Temptationz]
Kush come from Greensboro, North Carolina, where I’m from
Where they pack bowls, but we keep a ton of ‘em
We staying lifted with the clouds, like Red Tails and we in the hail
That sticky got me coughing, more green than Magic Johnson
Weed got me on one, like where the fuck does it come from?
My nickname Dr. Greenthumb, that shit we on make your tongue numb
Got that BC Bud, all the way to Cali Chronic
You may think you’re high, but we on another planet

[Hook]
The more that you smoke, the better it gets
You can’t overdose, so keep ripping that shit
The longer you hold it in, the higher you get
That’s why my clique be smoking on that dank everyday (x2)

[Verse 3: KBM]
Bong rips, blowing O's
French inhale, that's all I know
I smoke that good, we pass the chronic
I'm super high, feeling super sonic
I'm feeling good, you feel it too?
We gotta go, bruh, and get some food
And roll another one while we in the car
We smoke the best... by far...
