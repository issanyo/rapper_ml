[Verse 1]
I'm at the late night function
Real late, but it's still poppin'
Young, rich and I still got it
You look like I should holla

[Pre-Chorus]
Who did you come here with?
You look like you's a option
Who did you come here with?
I want you around but I know
You don't need no one
Ooh, I know that you don't need no one
Oh, let me be the one
'Cause I know that you don't need no one
But I don't see no one but you

[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes off you
And I know you see it
It ain't a lie, it's true
'Cause I'm hypnotized by you
Can't keep my eyes off you
Can you keep a secret?
It ain't a lie, it's true
'Cause I'm hypnotized by you
'Cause I'm hypnotized by you

[Verse 2]
I pull up to the function
See you and I'm still waitin'
It's time I walk up on you
Hey, hello, what's your name?

[Pre-Chorus]
And who did you come here with?
You look like you's a option
Who did you come here with?
I want you around but I know
You don't need no one
Ooh, I know that you don't need no one
Oh, let me be the one
'Cause I know that you don't need no one
But I don't see no one but you

[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes off you
And I know you see it
It ain't a lie, it's true
'Cause I'm hypnotized by you
Can't keep my eyes off you
Can you keep a secret?
It ain't a lie, it's true
'Cause I'm hypnotized by you
'Cause I'm hypnotized by you

[Bridge]
Can't keep my eyes off you
Can't keep my eyes off you
It's true, it's true
And it's true, yeah
You know why it's true

[Outro]
Can't keep my eyes off you
It ain't a lie, it's true
'Cause I'm hypnotized by you
Can't keep my eyes off you
It ain't a lie, it's true
'Cause I'm hypnotized by you
