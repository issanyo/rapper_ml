[Verse 1]
I've been living with devils and angels
Angels, angels
Realize you and I are in the same boat
Same boat, yeah
Kills me how you love me, then you cut me down
I'll do the same
We been living like angels and devils
Devils

[Chorus]
I'm loving the pain
I never wanna live without it
So why do I try?
You drive me insane
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder
So why do I try?
You got me like na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Break]
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 2]
You and I redefine being love sick
Love sick, love sick
Through it all, you could still make my heart skip
Heart skip, yeah
Even when you're yelling at me, I still think you're beautiful
Through it all, you could still make my heart skip
Heart skip

[Chorus]
I'm loving the pain
I never wanna live without it
So why do I try?
You drive me insane
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder
So why do I try?
You got me like na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Bridge]
Ooh, baby, look at us
We been living like angels, living like devils
Ooh, baby, look at us
We been loving like angels, loving like devils
Ooh, baby, look at us
We been living like angels, living like devils
Ooh, baby, look at us
We been loving like angels, loving like devils
Ooh, baby, look

[Chorus]
I'm loving the pain
I never wanna live without it
So why do I try?
You drive me insane
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder
So why do I try?
You got me like na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
