[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Boy, so what's been on your mind?
For me, it's just you all the time
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I
We'll be alright
'Cause here, we get to take our time
You, you're finer than some wine
We don't need to go nowhere tonight
It's you and I
We'll be alright

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
I'll give you everything
I'll give you everything
You don't owe me anything
So when you're ready, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And then I'm like, "oh", your love
My, my, my, my, my
And then I'm like, "oh", yeah yeah
'Cause you're what I adore

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
After that
When you catch your breath
You look at me and say
"Love, are you real?"
Just don't pretend you're just a friend, boy

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
I'll give you everything
I'll give you everything
You don't owe me anything
So when you're ready, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And then I'm like, "oh", your love
My, my, my, my, my
And then I'm like, "oh", yeah yeah
'Cause you're what I adore

[Bridge]
Just don't pretend you're just a friend
Don't pretend you're just a friend
Don't pretend you're just a friend
Don't pretend you're just a friend, boy

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my
You got me screaming
My, my, my, ma-ma, my, my

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And then I'm like, "oh", your love
My, my, my, my, my
And then I'm like, "oh", yeah yeah
'Cause you're what I adore
