[Verse 1]
Did I wake you?
Were you sleeping?
Were you still in the bed, or is a nightmare keeping you up instead?
Poor baby, are you feeling guilty for what you did?
If you think you're hurting, you ain't seen nothing yet

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it really worth it?
Was she everything that you were looking for to feel like a man?
I hope you know that you can't come back
'Cause all we had is broken like shattered glass

[Chorus]
You're gonna see me in your dreams tonight
My face is gonna haunt you all the time
I promise that you gon' want me back
When your world falls apart, like shattered glass
Glass, glass, glass

[Verse 2]
Are you having trouble focusing throughout the day?
Do you find yourself still calling my name?
Do you wish you could rewind time and take it back?
I bet you realize that she ain't half the woman I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it really worth it?
Was she everything that you were looking for to feel like a man?
I hope you know that you can't come back
'Cause all we had is broken like shattered glass

[Chorus]
You're gonna see me in your dreams tonight
My face is gonna haunt you all the time
I promise that you gon' want me back
When your world falls apart, like shattered glass
Glass, glass, glass, glass, glass, glass
