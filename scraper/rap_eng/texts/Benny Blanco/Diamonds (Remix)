[VERSE 1]
Im feeling these emotions
Im tripping like some kinda way
Im feeling so distracted
Don't really know what I should say
While were chillin' sitting in the back, in the back
Of your daddy's cadillac, cadillac
And its messing me up inside my head, inside my head

[PRE]
Cause I can't stop thinking bout you everyday
Everything you do has me spinning like a record play-
You're undeniable
And I hope your thinking bout me everyday
Everything I do has you feeling high fly away
So uncontrollable

[CHOURS]
So shine bright tonight, you and I
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[VERSE 2]
I love you, I need you, I miss you and now I cannot breathe
Scared that the universe will tell you to run away
And I know that you feel the same, and I know that its a winning game
Cause my heart won't stop it keeps beating out heart won't stop it keeps beating
I know that you feel the same, and I know that its a winning game

[PRE]
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the light inside of you

[CHOURS]
So shine bright tonight, you and I
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
