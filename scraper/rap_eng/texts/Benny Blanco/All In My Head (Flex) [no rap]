[Chorus: Dinah]
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head

[Verse: Ally]
Curtains like waves closing in all around us
Dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us
So tongue in cheek when we're laying on roses
But you're touching my skin and you're leaving me hopeless

[Interlude: Lauren]
I wanna feel you un-, feel you under my body
I wanna feel you un-, feel you un-

[Chorus: Dinah & Normani]
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head, yeah

[Verse: Camila]
Curtains like waves closing in all around us, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us, no, no
So tongue in cheek when we're laying on roses
But you're touching my skin and you're leaving me hopeless

[Interlude: Lauren]
I wanna feel you un-, feel you under my body
I wanna feel you un-, feel you un-

[Chorus: Dinah & Normani]
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head, yeah

[Interlude: Lauren]
I wanna feel you un-, feel you under my body
I wanna feel you un-, feel you un-

[Chorus: Dinah & Normani]
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head
Flex, time to impress
Come and climb in my bed
Don't be shy, do your thing
It's all in my head, yeah

[Outro: Normani & Dinah]
Hey, it's all in my head
It's all in my head yeah
It's all in my head yeah
It's all in my head
