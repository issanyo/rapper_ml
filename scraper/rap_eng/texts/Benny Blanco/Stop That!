[Verse 1:  Michael Angelakos]
When your call comes crashing and I feel alone
It’s a rush then you bring it full stop
Well I never seem to ask
And you never seem to wonder
If it ever seems to be what it’s not

And at the break of dawn, all I do if I’m alone
As the sun eats away all this rot
It’s the shifting of the hands, it’s the shifting of the cards
Just to feel it in your hands while it’s hot

[Pre-Chorus]
And she goes... and she goes... and it goes

[Chorus]
I’m sorry honey, I’ll stop that, stop that
I’m sorry honey, I’ll stop that, stop that

[Verse 2:  Michael Angelakos]
Till the air feels chilly
And your love comes filling right up until it touches the brim
Well the others in the corner keep on blowing it over
Yeah, we’re dancing till we’re in a full spin

Well, if I take just a minute just to feel like we’re in it
For the reasons that I know that we're not
Then the room goes quiet, no I can’t really buy it
Since you’ve taken all the baggage I’ve got

[Pre-Chorus]
And she goes... and she goes... and it goes

[Chorus]
I’m sorry honey, I’ll stop that, stop that
I’m sorry honey, I’ll stop that, stop that

[Verse 3: Ryn Weaver]
You’re like a twist and a turning
I don’t know if you’re learning
What the others seem to think that you’ve got

You got the odds up against you
Stacking high as they can get to
And the room’s so unbearably hot

Well if my love’s just a pill that you popped to make you feel
Like there’s nothing that you have to run from

I take away your self pity and the rush of the city
And we’re off until you’re begging me to come

[Pre-Chorus Variation]
And it goes on, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
And it goes

[Bridge:  Michael Angelakos]
How many times do I have to say I’m sorry, how many times does it take
How many times does it take to get it right, how many times until I break
And it goes

[Chorus]
I’m sorry honey, I’ll stop that, stop that
I’m sorry honey, I’ll stop that, stop that
