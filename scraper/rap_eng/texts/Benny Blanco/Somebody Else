Yeah
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1]
It feels a way I can't explain so hold me babe
I know you can't stay too long yeah, yeah
And every melody has a way of reminding me
Of one of your favorite songs

[Pre-Hook]
And I know we can’t turn back time
I know we can’t right those wrongs
But at least inside my mind
(But at least inside my mind, oh yeah, yeah)
It doesn't seem like you’re gone (gone)

[Hook]
Even though I know you’re too busy
Loving somebody else
And you’re a million miles past gone
I wish my bed was warm
But you’re loving somebody else
You can hear my heart say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
While you're loving somebody else
(While you're loving sombebody else)
You can hear my heart say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
Cause you’re loving somebody else
(Somebody else)

[Verse 2]
When I see your face I start to break
I love you babe, it’s hard to keep staying strong
Yeah, right right
Cause it takes strength to keep from crying
Wish I knew how to not hold on

[Pre-Hook]
And I know we can’t turn back time
(Can't turn back time no, no)
I know we can’t right those wrongs
But at least inside my mind
(At least inside my mind, oh yeah)
It doesn't seem like you’re gone (gone)

[Hook]
Even though I know you’re too busy, yeaaaah
Loving somebody else (loving somebody else)
And you’re a million miles past gone
I wish my bed was warm
But you’re loving somebody else
Oooooh baby
You can hear my heart say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
While you’re loving somebody else (loving somebody else
(Cause you're loving somebody else)
You can hear my heart say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
I can't think cause you're loving somebody else

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you say I treat you like your ex did
So you screaming eff this, speeding to the exit
They say love is like chess, well
I was playing checkers and you was playing Tetris
Complicated on way too many levels
Too many skeletons in my closet, too many devils
Too many elephants in the room
I need a shovel to maneuver through the manure, all we do is a settle
Arguments about, all my whereabouts
All the girls I was with, are the reasons that I’ma be without
But I'm honest enough to admit, I shoulda honoured your bluff
The material stuff was hardly enough
Now when I call, it’s like I'm calling for what?
Now I know why I shoulda bought me a tux

Ooooooh
Ooooooh
Ooooooh

[Hook]
Even though I know you’re too busy yeaah
Loving somebody else (loving somebody else)
And you’re a million miles past gone
I wish my bed was warm
But you’re loving somebody else
(Loving somebody else)
You can hear my heart say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
While you're loving somebody else
(While you're loving somebody else)
You can hear my heart say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
Say (oh oh oh)
Cause you’re loving somebody else
(Somebody else)
