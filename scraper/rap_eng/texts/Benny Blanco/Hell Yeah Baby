[Intro]
Oh, boy
They try to shout
They hoot and hollar when they can
They see me out
Too bad I'm leavin' with my...

[Verse 1]
Hey, yeah, ha!
Pull up, pull up
Bass in the trunk
Valet gon' pick up, pick up
Turn out to ten, freakin' weekend
Been a minute, but I'm at it again

[Pre-Chorus v1]
Quick, snap a pic, then go
I'm already late but I take it slow
Gotta start a new trend, snapback, rubber band
Oh damn it's my song on the stereo
And it goes like...

[Chorus]
Na na na na na na na
I'm lookin' to lose control
Na na na na na na na
He said "girl can I take you home?"
And I was like
Ha ha, Hell yeah baby
Ha ha, Hell yeah Baby
Ha ha, Hell yeah baby
Ha ha, Let's go

[Verse 2]
Pull up, pull up
Don't give a what
My girls gon' switch up, switch up
Look at the crowd, take off the crown
Don't matter gon' get down, get down
Watchin' the girls get low
Lookin' like a rose up against that wall
Yeah, did it before, kicked down that door
Now you ain't gotta wait, here's a little bit more
And it goes like...

[Chorus]
Na na na na na na na
I'm lookin' to lose control
Na na na na na na na
He said "girl can I take you home?"
And I was like
Ha ha, Hell yeah baby
Ha ha, Hell yeah Baby
Ha ha, Hell yeah baby
Ha ha, Let's go

[Bridge]
Oh boy, they try to shout
They hoot and holler when they can
They see me out
Too bad I'm leaving with my...
My man, man
But if you ain't got one
Take a stand, stand
All my girls in the spot
It's your jam jam
But if you got a ring on it wave your hand, hand
Like a boss, Like a boss, Like a boss
Like a boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss

[Chorus]
Na na na na na na na
I'm lookin' to lose control
Na na na na na na na
He said "girl can I take you home?"
And I was like
Ha ha, Hell yeah baby
Ha ha, Hell yeah Baby
Ha ha, Hell yeah baby
Ha ha, Let's go
Ha ha, Hell yeah baby
Ha ha, Hell yeah Baby
Ha ha, Hell yeah baby
Ha ha, Let's go
Like a boss
(Hell yeah baby, Hell yeah baby, Hell yeah baby, Let's go)
