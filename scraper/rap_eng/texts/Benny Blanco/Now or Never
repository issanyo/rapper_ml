[Verse 1]
I don't wanna fight right now
I know you're always right
I know I need you 'round with me
But nobody waitin' 'round with me
Been through the ups
And the downs with me
Got a whole lot of love
But don't wanna spread it 'round with me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Never pick up, never call me
We're runnin' out of time
Never pick up when you want me
Gotta draw a line
I've done enough talking
Need to know that you're mine
We've done enough talking

[Chorus 1]
Gonna love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never
I want you to hold me down, down, down, down, down, down
Down forever
I want you around
Around, around forever
Want you to love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never

[Verse 2]
So I'm turnin' down the light right now
Callin' it a night
Wishin' you were with me
Being in a different town with me
We've been through it all
But you won't spit it out for me
Like talkin' to a wall
You won't tear it down for me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You never pick up, never call me
We're runnin' out of time
Never pick up when you want me
Startin' to draw the line
We've done enough talking
Need to know that you're mine
Done enough talking

[Chorus 1]
Gonna love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never
I want you to hold me down, down, down, down, down, down
Down forever
I want you around
Around, around forever
Want you to love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never

[Bridge]
Now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now

[Chorus 2]
Gonna hold me down, down, down, down, down, down
Down forever
I want you to hold me down, down, down, down, down, down
Down forever
I want you around
Around, around forever
Want you to love me now, now, now, now, now, now
Now or never

[Outro]
Mmm
Now or never
