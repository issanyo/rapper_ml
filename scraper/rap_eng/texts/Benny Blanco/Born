[Chorus]
I was born, born to love you
I was born, born to love you

[Verse 1]
Bust through the door said, "What’s your name"
Looking for somebody and you match the shame
Now don’t lie
Don't lie
You’ve seen the television and you know what’s up
The world's going crazy and you’re mighty stuck
So don’t lie
So don’t lie

[Pre-Chorus]
I said here that’s where I’ll be living until my times up
Yeah found someone to keep my head up
Yeah, trading darkness for the dawn

[Chorus]
I was born, born to love you
I was born, born to love you

[Verse 2]
Lost in stars since she was a girl
She dreamt of a place of a better world
It felt like sunlight
Tired of the days living in the dark
She ran to the place where the wild things are
It felt right
Cause it felt right

[Pre-Chorus]
She said here is where I’ll be living until my times up, yeah
Found my people now I’m made up
Always dark before the dawn
Always dark before the dawn

[Chorus]
I was born, born to love you
I was born, born to love you

[Outro]
I said here is where I’ll be living until my time's up
I said here I found my people now I’m made up, yeah
I was born (I was born in the city, born and raised) to love you
I was born (I was born in the city all my friends are here)
I was born (I was born in the city, born and raised)
(I was born in the city, all my friends are here)
I was born (I was born inside) to love you
No woo I woo I…
