[Verse 1]
Stepping over cracks in the pavement
Another night of being wasted
Staring at your name, staring at your name
I think you're hanging out somewhere downtown
I wonder who you dancing with now
Are you doing the same? Are you doing the same?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Close my eyes, and we're still naked
But then I see that my clock is changing
It's just another night on the other side

[Chorus]
Oh woah, oh woah woah
It's just another night on the other side
Oh woah, oh woah woah
It's just another night on the other side
On the other side

[Verse 2]
Hiding underground with the cool kids
I just choose to not wanna choose this
We're living different lives, we're living different lives

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's gonna be a way between us
Tearing down the walls of secrets
It's just another night on the other side

[Chorus]
Oh woah, oh woah woah
It's just another night on the other side
Oh woah, oh woah woah
It's just another night on the other side
On the other side

[Bridge]
Nothing's gonna keep us hostage
I don't wanna think, just stop this tonight
Baby don't you think we lost it
Just come to me, yeah

[Chorus]
There's gotta be a way between us
Tearing down our walls of secrets
It's just another night on the other side
