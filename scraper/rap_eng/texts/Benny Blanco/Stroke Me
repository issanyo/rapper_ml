Stroke me, stroke me
It's as easy as one, two, three
Stroke me, stroke me
I'll touch you if you touch me

Grab a hold of my johnson, I want some
Put away that fake I.D. from Wisconsin
If you're over eighteen then it's on
I don't give a shit if you live with your mom
I know you heard 'bout me
Mickey Avalon, rap's Ron Jeremy
Don't talk, drop to your knees
And I'll show you what the fuck I mean

Hey little lady, don't you say maybe
You and I could leave right now, (now)
Let's get naked, shake your moneymaker
Baby I'm a show you how to

Stroke me, stroke me, (How to stroke me)
It's as easy as one, two, three
Stroke me, stroke me
I'll touch you if you touch me

Let me take you back to my stabbin' cabin, (ooh,)
Betamax roll with the action
Pornographic passion
Californication bastard
Cassius Clay when I'm jabbin punani
Like Cunanan in Versace mansion
Baby let's get naughty
Shake your body

Hey little lady, don't you say maybe
You and I could leave right now, (now)
Let's get naked, shake your moneymaker
Baby I'm a show you how to

Stroke me, stroke me, (How to stroke me)
It's as easy as one, two, three
Stroke me, stroke me, (How to stroke me)
I'll touch you if you touch me

Touch, t-t-t-touch me
Touch, t-t-t-touch me

I've got a lot of lead in my zeppelin
So step in to climb my stairway to heaven
I'm rocking electric, (I'm rocking electric)
Talk talk to me sexy
Leslie don't mind when I call her Lindsay
Blowhan, slow down before you hit me
Let me get a look at the goods
She said that she wouldn't but I knew that she would

Hey little lady, don't you say maybe
You and I could leave right now, (now)
Let's get naked, shake your moneymaker
Baby I'm a show you how to

Stroke me, stroke me, (How to stroke me)
It's as easy as one, two, three
Stroke me, stroke me, (How to stroke me)
I'll touch you if you touch me

Stroke me, stroke me, (How to stroke me)
It's as easy as one, two, three
Stroke me, stroke me, (How to stroke me)
I'll touch you if you touch me
