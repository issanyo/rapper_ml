[Verse 1]
Just a little girl on a TV screen
Stuck inside a silver cage
Body tangled up in chains
Looking for the light in the misery
Trapped behind the windowpane
Everyday I feel the same
Close to giving up, giving everything
Struggling for air, I'm blue
Fucking with my head, confused
Sick and tired of drinking your sympathy
Fighting back, not gonna lose
It's true, I'm through, flying with you

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Promise, baby, that you will never forget me

[Verse 2]
Breaking down the doors, I'm invincible
See if you could stop me now
Super heroine, no doubt
Treating me like I was invisible
Thought that you could shut my mouth
But now I'm gonna burn you out

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Promise, baby, that you will never forget me

[Bridge]
I want to get out of here
I want to get out of here
We're breaking up, I'm breaking down (Woah-oh-oh)
I want to get out of here
I want to get out of here
I'm moving on, we're over now, over now (Oh!)

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Promise, baby, that you will never forget me
