[Verse 1]
I don’t wanna be a billionaire, who fucking cares?
Hide behind their cars and what they wear
And I heard that being filthy rich ain’t what it seems
Money can’t buy all the things I’ve seen

[Chorus]
Oh every time I close my eyes
I dream of what it must be like
To have the dollar rule your life
Oh I, I swear the only love affair is to be a billionaire

[Verse 2]
It’s a rich man’s story, twenty four years old
Putting daddy’s money inside of his nose
Oh he’s so damn lonely and his heart is cold
Even in fur coats, he drips with icy snow
It’s so dumb, dumb de-dumb-dumb, dumb, dumb
He’s so dumb, dumb de-dumb-dumb, dumb, dumb

[Chorus]
Oh every time I close my eyes
I dream of what it must be like
To have the dollar rule your life
Oh I, I swear the only love affair is to be a billionaire

[Verse 3]
Just a rich girl baby and she’s lost her soul
If you seen her lately, you wouldn’t even know
She got nip tuck, crazy, now she’s skin and bones
And the world’s so fake, she likes to call her own
It’s so dumb, dumb de-dumb-dumb, dumb, dumb
She’s so dumb, dumb de-dumb-dumb, dumb, dumb

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna be a billionaire, who fucking cares?
Hide behind their cars and what they wear
And I heard that being filthy rich ain’t what it seems
Money can’t buy all the things I’ve seen

[Chorus]
Oh every time I close my eyes
I dream of what it must be like
To have the dollar rule your life
Oh I, I swear the only love affair is to be a billionaire

[Outro]
I don’t wanna be a billionaire, who fucking cares?
