[Verse 1]
Here we go
Welcome to my funeral
Without you, I don't even have a pulse
All alone, it's dark and cold
With every move, I die
Here I go
This is my confessional
A lost cause
Nobody can save my soul
I am so delusional
With every move, I die

[Pre-Chorus]
I have destroyed our love, it's gone
Payback's a bitch
It's all my fault

[Chorus]
I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing it
With every move, I die
I'm faded, I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing it
With every move, I die

[Verse 2]
When did I become such a hypocrite?
Double life
Lies that you caught me in
Trust me, I'm paying for it
With every move, I die
On the floor, I'm just a zombie
Who I am is not who I wanna be
I'm such a tragedy
With every move, I die

[Pre-Chorus]
I have destroyed our love, it's gone
Payback's a bitch
It's all my fault

[Chorus]
I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing it
With every move, I die
I'm faded, I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing it
With every move, I die

[Bridge]
This is it, and now you're really gone this time
Never once thought I'd be in pieces left behind

[Chorus]
I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
Just fighting to get through the night
I'm losing it
With every move, I die
I'm faded, I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing it
With every move, I die
