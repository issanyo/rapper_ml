[Verse 1]
Runnin' through the jungle
Got me trippin', tearin' straight through the sky
I never really found what I was lookin' for
Until you and I, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you are the lightnin', I am the storm
Caught in the rain, your heart got torn
Making an earthquake, it's hard to ignore
Still you love me more and more

[Chorus]
I know that I'm hard to love
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better
But the ride is worth the rush
When we're together, when we're together
And it hurts to know I hurt you so
Been down this road, let's turn it back around
You say you're fine, I know you lie
You'll make this right
We'll turn it back around, and I'll try
Yeah, I'll try

[Verse 2]
Matches to the map
I kept it burnin', now there's smoke in my eyes
I never meant to hurt you
Flip the hourglass, and try to rewind, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm a volcano, and you are the cold
Under the ocean, blue and gold
Givin' you roses, your blood on the thorns
Makes you love me more and more

[Chorus]
I know that I'm hard to love
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better
But the ride is worth the rush
When we're together, when we're together
And it hurts to know I hurt you so
Been down this road, let's turn it back around
You say you're fine, I know you lie
You'll make this right
We'll turn it back around, I'll try
Yeah, I'll try
I'll try
Yeah, I'll try
I'll try

[Bridge]
I might speak before I think
I might jump straight through the fire
And you might think I'm crazy
But I'm crazy for you
When I look in your eyes
I know it's my fault that you don't trust me
But you've got to trust me
When I tell you you, I'll try (try, try, try)
I'll try (try, try, try)
I'll try (try, try, try)
I'll try (try, try, try)

[Chorus]
I know that I'm hard to love
I'm gettin' better, I'm gettin' better
But the ride is worth the rush
When we're together, when we're together
And it hurts to know I hurt you so
Been down this road, let's turn it back around
You say you're fine, I know you lie
You'll make this right
We'll turn it back around, I'll try
Yeah, I'll try
I'll try
Yeah, I'll try
I'll try

[Outro]
Give me one more chance
