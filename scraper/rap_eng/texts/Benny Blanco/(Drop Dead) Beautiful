[Verse 1]
Diamond, diamond, shining, shining
Ooh girl, you so fine
Gotta be the finest thing that I've seen in my life
I will pay whatever just to get a better view
And if you like the way I'm talking come and be my boo

[Pre-Hook]
Be my boo, be my boo
Be my sweetie, be my honey tonight
Be my boo, be my boo
Be my sweetie, be my honey tonight

[Hook]
Cause you're beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
You're some kind of fine

[Chorus]
Girl, you know you're beautiful
I know you've heard it before
Girl, I know you broke the mold
These girls can't even come close
These girls can't even come close
You're some kind of fine

[Verse 2]
Your booty blinding with my shade to cover up my eyes
Whoever said that beauty on the inside is a liar
'Cause what I'm staring at right now will make a grown man cry
From the way you girls are looking at me it must be cold outside

[Pre-Hook]
Be my boo, be my boo
Be my sweetie, be my honey tonight
Be my boo, be my boo
Be my sweetie, be my honey tonight

[Hook]
Cause you're beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
You're some kind of fine

[Chorus]
Girl, you know you're beautiful
I know you've heard it before
Girl, I know you broke the mold
These girls can't even come close
These girls can't even come close
You're some kind of fine

[Bridge x2]
Girl girl
Look at you
I wanna get, get, get next to you
Girl girl
Look at you
I wanna get, get, get next to you

[Hook]
Cause you're beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
Beautiful (drop dead)
You're some kind of fine

[Chorus]
Girl, you know you're beautiful
I know you've heard it before
Girl, I know you broke the mold
These girls can't even come close
These girls can't even come close
You're some kind of fine
