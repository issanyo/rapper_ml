[Verse 1]
Hot and dangerous
If you’re one of us, then roll with us
‘Cause we make the hipsters fall in love
And we’ve got hot-pants on and up
And yes of course we does
We’re running this town just like a club
And no, you don’t wanna mess with us
Got Jesus on my necklace

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexy-fied
So let’s go-o-o

[Chorus 1]
Tonight we’re going hard-hard-hard
Just like the world is ours-ours-ours
We’re tearin’ it apart-part-part
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
We’re dancing like we’re dumb-dumb-dumb
Our bodies going numb-numb-numb
We’ll be forever young-young-young
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are

[Verse 2]
DJ turn it up
It’s about damn time to live it up
I’m so sick of being so serious
It’s making my brain delirious
I’m just talkin’ truth
I’m telling you ’bout the shit we do
We’re sellin’ our clothes, sleepin’ in cars
Dressin’ it down, hittin’ on dudes (HARD!)

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Looking sick and sexy-fied
So let’s go-o-o

[Chorus 2]
Tonight we’re going hard-hard-hard
Just like the world is ours-ours-ours
We’re tearin’ it apart-part-part
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are

Tonight we’re going hard-hard-hard
Just like the world is ours-ours-ours
We’re tearin’ it apart-part-part
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are

[Bridge]
DJ turn it up
And turn it up
And turn it up
And turn it up

[Breakdown]
OW!

[Chorus 2]
Tonight we’re going hard-hard-hard
Just like the world is ours-ours-ours
We’re tearin’ it apart-part-part
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are

Tonight we’re going hard-hard-hard
Just like the world is ours-ours-ours
We’re tearin’ it apart-part-part
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
