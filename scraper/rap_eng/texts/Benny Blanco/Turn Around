[Verse 1: Conor Maynard]
Turn around, open your eyes
Look at me now
Turn around, girl I've got you
We won't fall down
We can see, forever from up here
So long as we're together
Have no fear, no fear

[Hook: Conor Maynard]
So turn around
Floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now
So baby turn around
Floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now
Turn around

[Post-Chorus: Conor Maynard]
Turn around

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
Turn around, outer space
We can go there now, yeah
Ooh, turn around
There's no limit to what we found
Music oh, I wanna feel it all, yeah
And baby, we'll stay up
'Cause there's no way for us to fall, to fall

[Hook: Conor Maynard]
So turn around
Floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now
So baby turn around
Floating so high up off the ground
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now
Turn around

[Bridge: Conor Maynard, Ne-Yo & Both]
Oh, baby, we're so high now
Oh, tell our worries and our pain goodbye now
Oh-oh, ay, ay
Our home is the sky now
Oh, yeah, say we're never coming down, down, down
Oh woah

[Hook: Conor Maynard & (Ne-Yo)]
So turn around
Floating so high up off the ground (of the ground)
Floating so high, turn around (turn around)
Together nothing can stop us now (baby, nothing can stop us)
So baby turn around (oh-oh)
Floating so high up off the ground (oh, woah)
Floating so high, turn around
Together nothing can stop us now (together, now)
Turn around

[Outro: Conor Maynard]
Turn around (ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Turn around (ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Turn around (ooh, ah, ooh, ah)
Nothing can stop us now
