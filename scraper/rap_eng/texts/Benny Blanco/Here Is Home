[Verse 1]
I can't hold it, but I feel it in my bones
Throwin' roses with my faith in skipping stones
Everybody knows every single soul's looking for heaven
Chase the greener road, everybody roams, but you

[Chorus]
Cause when the rain falls or the river's dry running
You can fall into my arms
And if we're still living when the Earth stops spinning
You can fall into my arms
Singin' ooh, even if you stay or if you go
Singin' ooh, oh, I know you know that here is home
Yes, I know you know that here is home

[Verse 2]
I'll be walking slowly while the seasons come and go
No, I won't be lonely even when I'm all alone
And calling your name, and counting the days
Because everybody knows, every single soul's looking for heaven
Chase the greener road, everybody roams, but you

[Chorus]
Cause when the rain falls or the river's dry running
You can fall into my arms
And if we're still living when the Earth stops spinning
You can fall into my arms
Singin' ooh, even if you stay or if you go
Singin' ooh, oh, I know you know that here is home
Yes, I know you know that here is home

[Bridge]
Cause you know that I'm not worried about
Oh, where you go, baby, go live it up
Now, I'm not worried about
Oh, where you go, baby, go live it up
No, I don't know who you know, but I know we're enough

[Chorus]
When the rain falls or the river's dry running
You can fall into my arms
And if we're still living when the Earth stops spinning
You can fall into my arms
Singin' ooh, even if you stay or if you go
Singin' ooh, oh, I know you know that here is home
Yes, I know you know that here is home

[Outro]
If it takes two, I'm betting on you
To hold me tight when tides are high
What'll you do? I'm waiting on you
To dry these tears you made me cry
