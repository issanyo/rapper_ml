[Verse 1]
My girl might leave me if she hears about this
LA confidential, LA confidential
I hope she never has to hear about this
LA confidential, no

[Chorus]
'Cause you know I got somebody
So I can't fuck with just anybody
But sometimes I get lonely, I get lonely
So let me keep it down with you, down with you
Can you keep it down with me, down with me?
When I get lonely, I get lonely

[Post-Chorus]
Now and again, and again, and again, and again
Now and again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 2]
I hope you don't expect to be my girlfriend
LA confidential, LA confidential
'Cause I think you know I'd never leave my girlfriend
LA confidential, that's right

[Chorus]
'Cause you know I got somebody
So I can't fuck with just anybody
But sometimes I get lonely, I get lonely
So let me keep it down with you, down with you
Can you keep it down with me, down with me?
When I get lonely, I get lonely

[Post-Chorus]
Now and again, and again, and again, and again
Now and again, and again, and again, and again, yeah

[Bridge]
I hope you don't expect to be my girlfriend
'Cause I think you know I'd never leave my girlfriend

[Chorus]
'Cause you know I got somebody
So I can't fuck with just anybody
But sometimes I get lonely, I get lonely
So let me keep it down with you, down with you
Can you keep it down with me, down with me?
When I get lonely, I get lonely

[Post-Chorus]
Now and again, and again, and again, and again
Now and again, and again, and again, and again, yeah
