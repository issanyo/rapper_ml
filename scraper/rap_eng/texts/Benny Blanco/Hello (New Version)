[Intro]
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Hello mother, can you hear me now?
Hello papa, do I make you proud?
Am I everything you thought I'd be?
Hello brother, know you'll be a star
Hello sisters, I keep you on my arm
Because you're everything I thought you'd be

[Pre]
They said I'm a dreamer, but my eyes ain't closed
They said I will fall down, but my wings ain't broke
They said I won't make it, but now I'm on top
Before I was mute, but now I speak up, speak up

[Chorus]
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh oh oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Sorry old me, but I gotta leave
City of dreams is where you'll find me
Now I'm everything I want to be

[Pre]
They said I'm a dreamer, but my eyes ain't closed
They said I will fall down, but my wings ain't broke
They said I won't make it, but now I'm on top
Before I was mute, but now I speak up, speak up

[Chorus]
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh oh oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh
Hello, Hello, oh oh oh
