A friend indeed, come build me up
Come share your light, it makes me shine
You get the message, don't you ever forget it
Let's laugh and cry, until we die

If it wasn't for you, I'd be alone
If it wasn't for you, I'd be on my own
Don't wait 'til I do wrong
Don't wait 'til I put up a fight
You won my heart, without a question
Don't wait for life

I care for you, I talk to you
In my deepest dreams, I'm fortunate
We got a friendship, no one can contest it
And not to mention, I respect you with my all

Not a thing in the world could get between what we share
No matter where you at, no worry I'll be there
No one's got your back like I do
Even when the business ain't going well, we still cool
When I shine, you shine, always on your side
All my life you'll have what's mine
Mark my word, we gon' be alright
My brother, my sister we gon' be just fine

Don't wait 'til I... (do wrong)
Don't wait 'til I... (put up a fight)
You won my heart
Without a question
Don't wait for life
