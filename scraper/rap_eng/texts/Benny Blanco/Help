[Verse 1]
Open your eyes
Count your lucky stars that we’re even alive
Cause I feel like half the world lives in denial
When the other side can’t even survive, can’t even survive

[Pre]
One two, looking through life in someone else’s shoes
Three, four, eyes are sore, every day we see a war
Five, six, I admit sometimes I just wanna quit
But I got a question for you…

[Chorus]
Can we spread love tonight?
Oh woah woah, baby help me, help me
Can we try to make it right?
Oh woah woah, baby help me, help me
Cause I can’t do it on my own
No I can’t do it all alone
Can we spread love tonight?
Oh woah woah, baby help me, help me

[Verse 2]
Kids they learn how to be from what they see inside the media
Cause a child is an open wound before the hurt
And don’t stop to listen to their words, to their words

[Pre]
One two, looking through life in someone else’s shoes
Three, four, eyes are sore, every day we see a war
Five, six, I admit sometimes I just wanna quit
But I got a question for you…

[Chorus]
Can we spread love tonight?
Oh woah woah, baby help me, help me
Can we try to make it right?
Oh woah woah, baby help me, help me
Cause I can’t do it on my own
No I can’t do it all alone
Can we spread love tonight?
Oh woah woah, baby help me, help me

[Bridge]
Is anybody out there in love? (Is anybody out there in love?)
Is anybody feeling like us? (Is anybody feeling like us?)
Cause sometimes I need a shoulder, I think I need one now
The world is getting colder, so wrap your arms around each other
Be my lover, come here I’ll show you how
We just need one another, so let’s just hold it down

[Chorus]
Can we spread love tonight?
Oh woah woah, baby help me, help me
Can we try to make it right?
Oh woah woah, baby help me, help me
Cause I can’t do it on my own
No I can’t do it all alone
Can we spread love tonight?
Oh woah woah, baby help me, help me
