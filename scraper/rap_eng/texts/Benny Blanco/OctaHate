[Intro]
Watch it, watch it
Watch it, watch it

[Verse 1]
Lost in the cracks of the landslide
You saw me slipping on my blind side
I'm feeling lost, feeling tongue-tied
And now I'm frozen in your headlights

[Verse 2]
Deep in the haze of your love high
I used to soar on the live wire
I'm coming down from your supply
And I don't know if you can make right

[Chorus]
I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you baby
Earth keeps shaking all around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

[Interlude]
Watch it, watch it

[Verse 3]
Shot through the cracks of the earthquake
My body's moving into retrograde
I'm feeling loose, feeling untamed
And you're the dynamite in my chains

[Verse 4]
Deep in the trench of the crossfire
You shot me down from the live wire
Tossed to the loss in your love game
You beat me cheating and now I can't play

[Chorus]
I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you baby
Earth keeps shaking all around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

[Bridge]
Hit the ground running up from you
Baby, you know I don't want to, no, I want you
But there's nothing left to say
Lost in the riddle you gave me
Caught in the middle, you played me
I see so plainly, but there's nothing left to say
I should have known, I should have known
Known, no, no-no-no-no...

[Chorus]
I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it
Can't believe I went and lost you baby
Earth keeps shaking all around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

[Interlude]
(Ahh, all around)
(Ahh, all around)

[Outro]
Watch it, watch it
Watch it, watch it
