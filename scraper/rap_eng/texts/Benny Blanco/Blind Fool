[Verse 1]
I'm a blind fool
Wandering downtown looking for your car
Gotta find you
Still smell you close, no, you can't be far

And I try, too
Been a couple weeks waiting for your call
I'm a blind fool
Bottom of a bottle never felt so hard

[Pre-Chorus]
One more time, the blame's on me (and I know)
Two times, the shame's on me (even more)
Three times, I'm on my knees
Begging you for mercy
Begging you for mercy, please

Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

[Chorus]
My heart's holding on for life
This time I'm putting on the night
Have I lost my mind?
Bless my soul, and I'm at your door again
My heart's holding on for life

(My heart's holding on for life)

[Verse 2]
Help me, baby
I got some issues that I should address, get off my chest
So call me crazy
But lately I've been cleaning up my mess, I confess

I'm a blind fool
Wandering downtown looking for your car
Gotta find you
Still smell you close, no, you can't be far

[Pre-Chorus]
One time, the blame's on me (and I know)
Two times, the shame's on me (even more)
Three times, I'm on my knees
Begging you for mercy
Begging you for mercy, please
Oh, c'mon!

[Chorus]
My heart's holding on for life
This time I'm putting on the night
Have I lost my mind?
Bless my soul, and I'm at your door again
My heart's holding on for life

My heart's holding on for life
My heart's holding on

[Bridge]
I'm a blind fool
Gotta find you

[Chorus]
My heart's holding on for life (gotta find you)
This time I'm putting on the night (I'm a blind fool)
Have I lost my mind?
Bless my soul, and I'm at your door again (gotta find you)
My heart's holding on for life
