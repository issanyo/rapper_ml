[Verse 1]
Can you tell me, who called a race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time?
But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just canâ€™t push rewind

[Chorus]
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

[Verse 2]
Do you ever think that, we're just chasing our tails?
Like life is one big fast treadmill
And we pop what is prescribed
If it gets us first prize
But you know who I, who I think will win
Are the ones that let love in
Are the ones that take the time

[Chorus]
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

[Bridge]
Be here with me now
Be here with me now
'Cause the future is right now, right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now, I'm in front of you
Baby, don't blink and miss this moment

[Chorus]
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now
