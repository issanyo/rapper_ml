[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm wrong, you decide
Should've been strong, yeah, I lied
Nobody gets me like you
Couldn't keep hold of you then
How could I know what you meant?
There was nothing to compare to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's a mountain between us
But there's one thing I'm sure of
That I know how I feel about you

[Chorus]
Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

[Verse 2]
All that it takes, one more chance
Don't let our last kiss be our last
I'm out of my mind just to show you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know everything changes
I don't care where it takes us
'Cause I know how I feel about you

[Chorus]
Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

[Bridge]
Not a day, pass me by
Not a day, pass me by
When I don't think about you
And there's no moving on
'Cause I know you're the one
And I can't be without you

[Chorus]
Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

[Chorus]
Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

[Outro]
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now
But I know how I feel about you now
Yeah, I know how I feel about you now
