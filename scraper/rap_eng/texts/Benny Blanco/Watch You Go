[Verse 1]
I'm seeing brake lights
That means he's leaving me again
But this is like the eight time
I guess I'll see him in the morning
Cause he'll come back, he always does
And then we fight and then we fuss again
Back to the beginning

[Chorus]
But we seem to make up every time (every time)
But when we don't break up the fault is mine (fault is mine)
But before we fall out again
There's something you should know
I hate to see you leave
But I love, to watch you go (go, go)
Love to watch you go (go, go)

[Verse 1]
I'm seeing daylight, and I'm still alone in my bed
Something ain't right, so should I go to him instead?
I messed up this time, I always do
And then we fight and then we're through again
Back to the beginning

[Chorus]
But we seem to make up every time (every time)
But when we don't break up the fault is mine (fault is mine)
But before we fall out again
There's something you should know
I hate to see you leave
But I love, to watch you go (go, go)
Love to watch you go (go, go)

[Bridge]
Who's gonna help me save us?
He made us, want again
Will he take me back this time?
After what I did
He has no idea
Why he should spend one more night here
It's over, again, again

[Chorus]
But we seem to make up every time (every time)
But when we don't break up the fault is mine (fault is mine)
But before we fall out again
There's something you should know
I hate to see you leave
But I love, to watch you go (go, go)
But we seem to make up every time (every time)
But when we don't break up the fault is mine (fault is mine)
But before we fall out again
There's something you should know
I hate to see you leave
But I love, to watch you go (go, go)
Love to watch you go (go, go)
