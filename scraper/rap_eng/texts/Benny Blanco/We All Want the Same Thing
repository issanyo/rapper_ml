(Chorus)
So take my hand and make me it easy for me
Cause it's been hard enough just watching you tonight
I don't wanna hear your reasons, baby
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing
So take my hand and make me it easy for me
Cause it's been hard enough just watching you tonight
I don't wanna hear your reasons, baby
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing

(Verse 1)
I gotta know, girl, what's your name?
You got me wrapped up tight around your finger
I chase you down, you disappear
Wish you could tell me what I wanna hear

(Pre-Chorus)
And all I wanna hear is you wanna get down
Now I want you to prove it right here on the couch, yeah
All I wanna do is get you to myself, get, get you to myself
Can't have nobody else, else

(Chorus)
So take my hand and make me it easy for me
Cause it's been hard enough just watching you tonight
I don't wanna hear your reasons, baby
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing
So take my hand and make me it easy for me
Cause it's been hard enough just watching you tonight
I don't wanna hear your reasons, baby
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing

(Verse 2)
I only got myself to blame
You got me trapped like love is just a game
I run around, you reappear
Wish you could tell me what I wanna hear

(Pre-Chorus)
And all I wanna hear is you wanna get down
Now I want you to prove it right here on the couch, oh
All I wanna do is get you to myself, get, get you to myself
Can't have nobody else, else

(Chorus)
So take my hand and make me it easy for me
Cause it's been hard enough just watching you tonight
I don't wanna hear your reasons, baby
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing
So take my hand and make me it easy for me
Cause it's been hard enough just watching you tonight
I don't wanna hear your reasons, baby
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing

(Bridge)
Ooh, when you move like that I suffer, baby
You got a hold on me that I can't deny
Ooh, come on don't let go, get to know me, baby
Get to know me baby
Get to know me baby

(Chorus)
So take my hand and make me it easy for me
Cause it's been hard enough just watching you tonight
I don't wanna hear your reasons, baby
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing
So take my hand and make me it easy for me
Cause it's been hard enough just watching you tonight
I don't wanna hear your reasons, baby
We all want the same thing, we all want the same thing
