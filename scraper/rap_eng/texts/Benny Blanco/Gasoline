[Intro]
Oh, ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You're so bright, like a dream
You burn up everything
We might make a scene
Ignite gasoline

[Pre-Chorus]
When the music goes up and the sun goes down
Lightning strikes and I'm on the ground
Only one that I want around, is you
Yeah

[Chorus]
Spark and it's like gasoline
I start burning like a machine
My heart only runs on supreme
So hot, give me your gasoline, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You set me on fire, you set me on fire
You set me on fire, yeah
You set me on fire, you set me on fire
You set me on fire, yeah

[Verse 2]
Heat wave on the floor
Escape, exit door
Your touch, burning me
It's too much, gasoline

[Pre-Chorus]
When the music goes up and the sun goes down
Lightning strikes and I'm on the ground
Only one that I want around, is you
Yeah

[Chorus]
Spark and it's like gasoline
I start burning like a machine
My heart only runs on supreme
So hot, give me your gasoline, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You set me on fire, you set me on fire
You set me on fire, yeah
You set me on fire, you set me on fire
You set me on fire, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, damn boy
What you do to me? Yeah
You set me on fire! Yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Spark and it's like gasoline
I start burning like a machine
My heart only runs on supreme
So hot, give me your gasoline, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You set me on fire, you set me on fire
You set me on fire, yeah
You set me on fire, you set me on fire
You set me on fire (it's hot in here), yeah
