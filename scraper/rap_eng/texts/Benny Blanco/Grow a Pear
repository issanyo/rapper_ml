[Verse 1]
Last night I had enough of you, I put on the brakes
And I could tell you took it hard, it was all over your face
That you were slipping and flipping
But here is the sitch
I signed up for a man, but you are just a bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
You should know that I love you a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag'

[Chorus]
When we fell in love, you made my heart drop
Then you had me thinking 'bout you non-stop
But you cry 'bout this and whine about that
When you grow a pair, you can call me back
Yeah, I think you're hot, I think you're alright
But you're acting like a chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not, just like that
When you grow a pair, you can call me back

[Verse 2]
When I first met you; panties dropping
Everytime I saw you, it was on, and
One day you asked if we could just talk
And that's the reason why I'm walking
If I am honest, I'm just not hooked on your phonics
I'm not tryin to be rude or crude
I just wanted one thing from you and you got confused

[Pre-Chorus]
You should know that I love you a lot
But I just can't date a dude with a vag'

[Chorus]
When we fell in love, you made my heart drop
Then you had me thinking 'bout you non-stop
But you cry 'bout this and whine about that
When you grow a pair, you can call me back
Yeah, I think you're hot, I think you're alright
But you're acting like a chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not, just like that
When you grow a pair, you can call me back

[Breakdown]
When you grow a pair, you can call me back
When you grow a pair, you can call me back
Grow a pair, you can call me back
When you grow a pair, you can call me back

[Bridge]
Oh, grow a pair
You can call me back
And no, I don't want to see your mangina
When you grow a pair, you can call me back

[Chorus]
When we fell in love, you made my heart drop
Then you had me thinking 'bout you non-stop
But you cry 'bout this and whine about that
When you grow a pair, you can call me back
Yeah, I think you're hot, I think you're alright
But you're acting like a chick all the time
You were cool and now you're not, just like that
When you grow a pair, you can call me back
