[Verse 1]
Back door cracked, we don't need a key
We get in for free
No VIP sleaze
Drink that Kool-Aid, follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're coming with me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's time to kill the lights and shut the DJ down
Tonight we're taking over, no one's getting out

[Chorus]
This place about to blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Now what?
We're taking control
We get what we want
We do what you don't
Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time to lose your mind and let the crazy out
Tonight we're taking names, 'cause we don't fuck around

[Chorus]
This place about to blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-oh
Blowâ€“oh-oh
This place about to blow-oh-oh-oh
This place about to blow
This place about to blow
Oh, this place about to blow
