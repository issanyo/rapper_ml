[Chorus]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone, yeah
But while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young

[Verse 1]
Hearts, out our minds
Running 'til we outta time
Wild childs, looking good
Living hard just like we should
Don't care who's watching when we tearing it up
That magic that we got, nobody can touch

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking for some trouble tonight
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side
Like it's the last night of our lives
We'll keep dancing 'til we die

[Chorus]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone, yeah
While you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young, yeah
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young...

[Verse 2]
Punks taking shots
Stripping down to dirty socks
Music up, getting hot
Kiss me, give me all you've got
It's pretty obvious that you got a crush
That magic in yo' pants, it's making me blush

[Pre-Chorus]
Looking for some trouble tonight
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side
Like it's the last night of our lives
We'll keep dancing 'til we die

[Chorus]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone, yeah
While you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young, yeah
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young, yeah

[Outro]
We're gonna die
Let's make the most of the night, like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
