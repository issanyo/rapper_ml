[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Last night I let the party get the best of me
Waking up in the morning, two hoes laying next to me
Plus I heard an officer arrested me
Good weed and cold drinks
That's the motherfucking recipe
Nigga and we roll deep, so deep
It's going down in this bitch; concrete
We gon' party all night, no sleep
Tell the owner them is all my guys
So tonight everything is on me

[Pre-Hook 1: Wiz Khalifa]
The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high we don't see the whole suite
Then fly to a level where you gon' need your own key
T—G—O—D

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
No job and no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No job and no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Leaving from the club, now she wanna stay with us
Came to spend it all, don't care what I'm paying for
Used to be too young, now I'm out here buying the bar
Every time I look up, it's another red cup
Bunch of niggas in the game, but they ain't playin' wit us
They ain’t paying enough
Man, them niggas ain't ballin'
They just laying it up
Saying they does
I'm just rolling hella weed up
While on my way to the club
I had to wait at the club
But now I don't
Cause everything is on me

[Pre-Hook 2: Wiz Khalifa]
The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high we see the whole street
We fly, I mean so fly we need a whole wing
T—G—O—D

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
No job and no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No job and no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]

Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
