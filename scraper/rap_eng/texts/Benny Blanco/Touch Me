[Intro]
If you like my body
Touch me, touch me, touch me, ta-touch me
Touch me, touch me, touch me, ta-touch me
Touch me, touch me, touch me, ta-touch me
[Flo Rida]

[Verse 1]
Hey I like it when you tellin' me to keep in touch
All over your body rub it like good luck
Never stand up shawty keep me doin' too much
Hands where they oughtta be unleash that stunt
And no apology so please don't fuss
Quicksand quality, its goin' down pretty ruff
Brand new ... all about that rush
Keep tellin me to fill it, its just my luck
Imma help you make that movie
Get on my top cause' I like my duty
Get it involved nevermind the goopies
She a dawg so I let her be snoopy
Round of applause make it drop like a oozie
...cute like suzy
Send her to the top with a coofie
You momma just gave me a call I hear you I heard you say

[Hook]
Touch me baby, touch me all night long
Touch me baby, ya

[Verse 2]
I'm into that talk
I'm into that walk
I got a thing for them dollars an its all my fault
Let ma second head tell it ima break you off
Tell 'em I said they got a whole lotta balls
I wonna go hard, Shawty give us that stuff
...balls
I'm gunna rump and a bump and a stomp for them calls
I'm gunna hump automatic from the window to the wall
Yea I'm wonna get it right wid you all ready
Pull it down ... yea c'mon lady
... gotta fetish
...grown man wid it baby
All out to the spot like its on freddy
Understand I do it big for the gwop baby
When a momma feelin hot take her to the tele
I don't like 'em scary like the girls who whip my silly like

[Hook]
Touch me baby, touch me all night long
Touch me baby, ya

[Bridge]
I like you sexy
I want you next to me
Lets be the legacy
Got me feelin like XTC
And a little bit of jelousy
Its all about your melody
Right where I care to be
Shawty thats definately a fellony
Want me to touch you thats cool
I spend my paper on you
And pick you up in my coupe
And make it do what it do
Shawty don't get it confused
You sure that we can get loose
All out I'm breaking the rules
Go hard, I like when you said

[Hook]
Touch me, touch me, touch me, ta-touch me
Touch me, touch me, touch me, ta-touch me

[Outro]
Touch me baby touch me all night long
Touch me baby, ya
