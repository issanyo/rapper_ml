[Pre-Chorus: MØ]
I know, I know
I know, I know
You'll never be mine
I know, I know
I know, I know, yeah
You'll never be mine

[Chorus: MØ]
I like the way your body moving
I like the way you spread confusion
I like the way my heart is booming
On and on, you'll never be mine

[Chorus: MØ]
I like the way your body moving
I like the way you spread confusion
I like the way my heart is booming
On and on, you'll never be mine

[Post-Chorus: MØ]
You'll never be mine

[Verse 1: MØ]
I'll be waiting
I'll be, I'll be
I'll be waiting
No, you'll never be mine

[Pre-Chorus: MØ]
I know, I know
I know, I know
You'll never be mine
I know, I know
I know, I know, yeah
You'll never be mine

[Chorus: MØ]
Yeah, I like the way your body moving
I like the way you spread confusion
I like the way my heart is booming
On and on, you'll never be mine

[Post-Chorus: MØ]
You'll never be mine
No, you'll never be mine

[Chorus: MØ]
I like the way your body moving
I like the way you spread confusion
I like the way my heart is booming
On and on, and on and on

[Outro: MØ & SOPHIE]
And on and on
And on and on
And on and on
Oh yeah, you'll never be mine
And on and on
And on and on
And on and on
And on and on
