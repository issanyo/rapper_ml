[Verse 1]
Raindrops on her cheek, but the sky is dry
School uniform is torn, but she won't say why
Now Alice are you ok?
Are you sure that you're fine?
Is there something you're tryna hide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Girls and boys alike
Time to end this fight
Before it's too late

[Chorus]
Now you just gotta know I'm here for you
And i will fight until i'm black and blue
'Cause sticks and stone may break my bones
But it's all worth while if I've got you
Because i'm here for you, for you, for you
Because i'm her for you, for you, y-y-you
Because i'm here for you

[Verse 2]
Daydreamin' out the window
Prayin' for help
Too young to talk but he knows a leather belt
No Sonny, is not okay
'Cause i heard his cry
And his Daddy still denies

[Pre-Chorus]
Girls and boys alike
Time to end this fight
Before it's too late

[Chorus]
Now you just gotta know i'm here for you
And i will fight until I'm black and blue
'Cause sticks and stone may break my bones
But it's all worth while if I've got you
Because i'm here for you, for you, for you
Because i'm her for you, for you, y-y-you
Because i'm here for you

[Bridge]
'Cause I am just like you but I got away
These bruises make me who I am today
And no I'm not okay
I'm just great
Pamela's by my side
Thank you Mr. Wade

[Outro]
And you just gotta know I'm here for you (you, you, you, you)
And i will fight until I'm black and blue (blue, blue, blue blue)
'Cause sticks and stones may break my bones
But It's all worth while if I've got you
