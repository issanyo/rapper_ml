[Verse 1]
If I had a free spirit
You would probably appreciate it
That day we bonded like Chemical Brothers
I was gonna be a pop star
You wrote it on your wall
Little did I know, did I know

[Pre-Bridge]
There's a piece of my heart for you
There's a piece of my heart for you
The pain isn't nothing, though, I felt it
There's a piece of my heart for you
There's a piece of my heart for you
I broke it in two for you, you can have it

[Bridge]
Don't call me a friend, ayy
Don't call me a friend, yeah
Don't call me a friend, ayy yeah
You know it's more than that
It's more than that

[Verse 2]
I'm still figuring out, how you tryna come across
I don't got time for that
Ah, now you wanna break something, uh

[Chorus]
Break my heart (Ahh)
Break my heart (Ahh)

[Verse 3]
And I know, 'cause I saw
That's how this goes, ain't it?
Ain't it kinda fucked up? Ah, yeah
When I think about it, when I think about it
When I, when I, when I, I got friends
[?]
I know you wanna break something

[Chorus]
Break my heart (Ahh)
Break my heart (Ahh)
(Ah nah, I can't give up
Ah yeah)

[Monologue]
So I gave him an ultimatum, and I said, "I can't just keep living and moving with you all over the United States without a commitment." There's no certainty, you know, of a future, and I wanted to have children, and that was important to me, so, we got married. I'm not sure, I think I would've waited to find... I probably would've held out longer to get married 'cause I, I just, I don't know. You never really know for sure, but I had serious doubts when I got married, and I, I should've listened to my heart more. 'Cause when you're young, you're idealistic, and you think your love is gonna change a person, but it really doesn't. They are who they are. Think it might make slight modifications, but they basically are who they are and who you see and who you feel that they are. So be cautious when you're searching, and don't just give your love away.
