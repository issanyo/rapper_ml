[Verse 1]
Can I hit you later?
'Cause this my jam
Rolling in my beat up gold Trans Am
Sorry, I can't hear you
And I got plans
You won't get me naked
You had your chance

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I said I wouldn't talk about you publicly, but
That was before I caught you lying and cheating on me, slut
I was down for you hardcore
While you were out trying to score
Found out you're full of it
I'm over it
So suck my dick

[Chorus]
I heard our song on the radio
And I'd see your face everywhere I go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you, thinking of you
But now my song's on the radio
And you see my face everywhere you go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you, thinking of you

[Verse 2]
So I got your message
Are you having fun with your fugly girlfriend?
Yeah, I moved on
Can I hit you later?
Gotta get to stage
In a brand new city, getting laid

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I said I wouldn't talk about you publicly, but
That was before I caught you lying and cheating on me, slut
I was down for you hardcore
While you were out trying to score
Found out you're full of it
I'm over it
So suck my dick

[Chorus]
I heard our song on the radio
And I'd see your face everywhere I go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you, thinking of you
But now my song's on the radio
And you see my face everywhere you go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you, thinking of you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I heard our song on the radio
And I'd see your face everywhere I go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you, thinking of you
But now my song's on the radio
And you see my face everywhere you go
I thought I'd call just to let you know
I've been thinking of you, thinking of you

[Outro]
