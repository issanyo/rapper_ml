[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
Too much ice around my neck, it got me paranoid
My main bitch just met my ex, it got me paranoid
I'm the iPhone and your new nigga the Android
I just came in for the check then hit the airport
Hop out fly as hell like the air force (Air Force One)
My pockets look like they poppin' steroids (yeah yeah)
Take your bitch, go shoppin', we at the Chanel store
I just spent so many racks it made her paranoid

[Verse 1: Trill Sammy]
Had to pour me up a cup 'cause I was paranoid
Double stuff my Backwood up, I need a damn torch
VVS's dancing like they hit the dance floor
I just tap the gas, two hundred on the dashboard, it got me paranoid
I think I'm getting too paid
What can I buy today?
Bet me some racks on 2K
My bitch she bad, she slay
Always callin' from anonymous numbers
But still won't reply to the bitch
Stack the cash up and just keep it a hundred
You niggas not made for this shit

[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
Too much ice around my neck, it got me paranoid
My main bitch just met my ex, it got me paranoid
I'm the iPhone and your new nigga the Android
I just came in for the check then hit the airport
Hop out fly as hell like the air force (Air Force One)
My pockets look like they poppin' steroids (yeah yeah)
Take your bitch, go shoppin', we at the Chanel store
I just spent so many racks it made her paranoid

[Verse 2: Trill Sammy]
I can't trust a soul, I'm too paranoid
Who that at the door? I'm too paranoid
Thirty thousand on the watch is what I paid for it
Still got kicks around the crib that I need space for
Pull up valet, open the door
Fuck with shawty on the low
I smoke a whole OZ right now
Yeah, I think I need more
I think I'm too paranoid, still got problems that I'm tryna avoid
New designer shit, I ain't even wore it
Want the blue face hundreds of course

[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
Too much ice around my neck, it got me paranoid
My main bitch just met my ex, it got me paranoid
I'm the iPhone and your new nigga the Android
I just came in for the check then hit the airport
Hop out fly as hell like the air force (Air Force One)
My pockets look like they poppin' steroids (yeah yeah)
Take your bitch, go shoppin', we at the Chanel store
I just spent so many racks it made her paranoid

[Verse 3: J.I.D.]
Lil forty on me now 'cause I be paranoid
I smell bitch niggas, it's a sickness, the shit's airborne
I take niggas to school so grab a seat, have a chair boy
Run my bands or you can meet the snare, lookey here
I swung a brass war
Hop, jump, skipped into clairvoyant attempt
To snatch a bag or snatch a bitch, I got a batch
A rocket ship right to the top
A rocket dick right to your box
I'm poppin' shit, shit poppin' lip
Leave that bitch sloppy wet

[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
Too much ice around my neck, it got me paranoid
My main bitch just met my ex, it got me paranoid
I'm the iPhone and your new nigga the Android
I just came in for the check then hit the airport
