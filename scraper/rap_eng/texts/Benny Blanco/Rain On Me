[Verse 1]
Hello, you
Can you hear me when I'm speaking?
Is it true
Or am I sleeping too?
Now where are you?
I set this table out for two
So get your head out of the clouds

[Chorus]
Ahhh ah ah, ahhh ah ah, ahhh ah ah
Rain on me, rain on me
'Cause when I'm all cloud, need a storm
Come on!
So rain on me, yeah, rain on me

[Verse 2]
Hello, you
I'm still speaking to you
Can't say goodbye, oh I
Am waiting by the phone
If we argued a little later
If we kissed a little longer
Would your head be out of the clouds?

[Chorus]
Ahhh ah ah, ahhh ah ah, ahhh ah ah
Rain on me, rain on me
'Cause when I'm all cloud, need a storm
Come on!
So rain on me, yeah, rain on me

[Bridge]
Ai-ah ai-ah rain
Ai-ah an' a rain
Oh dubba dubba rain
Rain!
Uh da-da-da rain
Ooh rain
Eh eh eh eh

[Chorus]
Ahhh ah ah, ahhh ah ah, ahhh ah ah
Rain on me, rain on me
'Cause when I'm all cloud, need a storm
Come on!
So rain on me, yeah, rain on me
