[Verse 1]
French finger tips, red lips
Bitch is dangerous
Cotton candy kiss
Can't wait for my sugar rush

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take it no more
I've got to have more tonight
This feeling so strong
I'm putting you on tonight
Alright, let's go

[Chorus]
Baby, take a seat
Eyes on me, this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me, baby, let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather

[Verse 2]
Heels six-inch
Makes a boy wanna bite his lip
Look, but don't touch
Unless you wanna lose your innocence

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't take it no more
I've got to have more tonight
This feeling so strong
I'm putting you on tonight
Let's go

[Chorus]
Baby, take a seat
Eyes on me, this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me, baby, let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather

[Bridge]
Leather, leather, leather, leather, leather
Lace and leather, lace and leather
Leather, leather, leather, leather, leather
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, take a seat
Eyes on me, this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me, baby, let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather
Baby, take a seat
Eyes on me, this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me, baby, let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather
