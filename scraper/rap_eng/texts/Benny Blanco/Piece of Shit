[Verse 1]
Do you think I'm skinny
Or should I lose a few?
You told me to stop eating
Now am I good enough for you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your mouth is a gun
It shoots me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground

Got my dignity
Pull the bullet out
But I pick myself up
Now watch me turn around

[Chorus]
'Cause I think you're the one with issues
I'm not your Barbie, you're so superficial
Yes, you are, over and over again
You're just a piece of shit to me

[Verse 2]
Do you like my boobies?
Would you rather they were huge?
You told me you like porn stars
So I guess that means we're through

[Pre-Chorus]
Your mouth is a gun
It shoots me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground

Got my dignity
Pull the bullet out
But I pick myself up
Now watch me turn around

[Chorus]
'Cause I think you're the one with issues
I'm not your Barbie, you're so superficial
Yes, you are, over and over again
You're just a piece of shit to me

[Bridge]
Oh, ah, yeah yeah, ha ha
You're just a piece of shit to me
Oh, na-na-na, yeah me

Because I think you're the one with issues
I'm not your Barbie, you're so superficial
Oooh, over and over again
You're just a piece of shit to me, to me
You're just a piece of shit to me, oooh
