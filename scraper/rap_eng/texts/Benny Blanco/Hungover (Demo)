And now the sun is rising
Now the long walk back home
There's just so many faces
But no one I need to know

In the dark I can fight it
I fake 'til I'm numb
But in the bright light
I taste you on my tongue

Now the party's over and everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter or am I just hungover you
Or am I just hungover

Even my dirty laundry
Everything just smells like you
And now my head is throbbing
Every song is out of tune just like you

In the dark I can fight it
'Til it disappears
But in the daylight
I taste you in my tears

Now the party's over and everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter or am I just hungover you

Now I've got myself
Lookin' like a mess
Standing alone here at the end
Try to pretend but no
I put up my fight
But this is it this time
'Cause I'm here at the end
Try to pretend
I'm here at the end
Try to pretend and oh oh

And now the party's over and everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter or am I just hungover you

Now the party's over and everybody's gone
I'm left here with myself and I wonder what went wrong
And now my heart is broken like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter or am I just hungover you
Or am I just hungover
