[Verse 1]
Whose fault is this
That I'm crazy about you?
You are in every single dream
And I'm thinking about you

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna do, do, do me right
Do, do, do, do, do
If you wanna leave it all tonight
Do, do, do, do, do

[Chorus]
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne

[Verse 2]
I count every kiss
Till I'm finally sleeping
This love supreme
That's why I'll always give in

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna do, do, do me right
Do, do, do, do, do
If you wanna leave it all tonight
Do, do, do, do, do

[Chorus]
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne

[Bridge]
All I want is your love
Don't give in
All I want is your love
Don't give in
All I want is your love
Don't give in
All I want is your
All I want is your

[Chorus]
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne
When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne

[Outro]
And I won't be mad, I won't be mad
Champagne kisses
And I won't be mad, I won't be mad
Champagne kisses
