[Verse 1]
I see rainbows everywhere
When we get those
I'm like yeah yeah yeah
From my heart flood in the air-air-air
When my world slows

[Pre-Chorus]
La ra da ra di dum
At the tip of my tongue
You just got me numb
La ra da ra di dum
Bucket wrap the [?]
After be my sweet [?]

[Chorus]
Cause it's you and I and we just don't stop
Cause it's on tonight, let the moonlight drop
They call me insane because in my brain
All i see is rainbows
And it's feels right when the music plays
And I come alive like a brand new day
They call me insane because in my brain
All i see is rainbows

[Verse 2]
Rainbows, shooting star-ar-ar
And we don't know where we are-are-are
Us together so it [?]

[Pre-Chorus]
La ra da ra di dum
At the tip of my tongue
You just got me numb
La ra da ra di dum
Bucket wrap the [?]
After be my sweet [?]

[Chorus]
Cause it's you and I and we just don't stop
Cause it's on tonight, let the moonlight drop
They call me insane because in my brain
All i see is rainbows
And it's feels right when the music plays
And I come alive like a brand new day
They call me insane because in my brain
All i see is rainbows

[Chorus]
You and I and we just don't stop
Cause it's on tonight, let the moonlight drop
They call me insane because in my brain
All i see is rainbows
And it's feels right when the music plays
And I come alive like a brand new day
They call me insane because in my brain
All i see is rainbows
