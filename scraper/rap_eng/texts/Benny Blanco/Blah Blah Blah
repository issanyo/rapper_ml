[Intro: Kesha]
Badda-da-dah, badda-da-bah-bah
Coming out'cha mouth with'cha blah, blah, blah
Zip your lip like a padlock
And meet me in the back with the Jack at the jukebox
I don't really care where you live at
Just turn around boy, let me hit that
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat
Just show me where your dick's at

[Pre-Chorus: Kesha]
Music's up
Listen hot stuff, I'm in love with this song
So just hush
Baby, shut up
Heard enough

[Chorus: Kesha]
Stop ta-ta-talking that blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car-ar-ar
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

[Verse 1: Kesha]
Boy, c'mon and get my rocks off
Come put a little love in my glove box
Wanna dance, with no pants on?
Meet me in the back with the Jack at the jukebox
So cut to the chase, kid
'Cause I know you don't care what my middle name is
I wanna be naked and you're wasted

[Pre-Chorus: Kesha]
Music's up
Listen hot stuff, I'm in love with this song
So just hush
Baby, shut up
Heard enough

[Chorus: Kesha]
Stop ta-ta-talking that blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car-ar-ar
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

[Bridge: 3OH!3]
You be delaying, you always saying some ​shit
You say I'm playin', I'm never layin' the dick
Saying, "Blah, blah, blah."
'Cause I don't care who you are in this bar
It only matters who I is

[Chorus: Kesha]
Stop ta-ta-talking that blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car-ar-ar
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car-ar-ar
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

[Outro: Kesha]
Oh
Blah blah blah
Stop talking
Stop ta-ta-talking that
