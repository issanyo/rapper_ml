Who's fault is this
That I'm crazy about you
You are in every single dream
And I'm thinking about you

If you wanna do, do, do me right
Do, do, do, do, do
If you wanna leave it all tonight
Do, do, do, do, do

I count every kiss
Till I'm finally sleeping
This love supreme
That's why I'll always give in

If you wanna do, do, do me right
Do, do, do, do, do
If you wanna leave it all tonight
Do, do, do, do, do

When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne

When there's nothing left
Except you and this
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne

Do, do, do, do, do...

Do me right

Do, do, do, do, do...

And I won't be mad
I won't be mad
Champagne kisses
And I won't be mad
I won't be mad
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses

(Do, do, do, do, do...)

And I won't be mad
I won't be mad
Champagne kisses
And I won't be mad
I won't be mad
Champagne kisses
(Do, do, do, do, do...)
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses
Champagne kisses...

(Don't give in, all I want is your love... )

Do me right

Do, do, do, do, do...

Do, do, do, do, do...

Do, do, do, do, do...

Do me right

Do, do, do, do, do

(Don't give in, all I want is your love... )
