[Verse 1]
You can say it all
And I can bite my tongue
Cause it would take all week
To tell you where I'm from
I know what your about
Why don't you close your mouth?
And step right over here
So we can dance this out

[Pre-Chorus]
These lazy days are way too long
Like razor blades, under your tongue
And the city lights, will burn you down
Or build you up, high above the ground

[Chorus]
High above the ground, high above the ground
High above the ground

[Verse 2]
The club is getting dark
And I can feel the heat
I set my hands right down
To right below your knees
If this is all there is
Then this is all there can be
Cause I don't see no road
That leads to you, and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Paved the way on empty roads
Into a grave gold headstone
And the path you take might be your own
But tonight, you walk on streets of gold

[Chorus]
Walk on streets of gold, you walk on streets of gold

[Bridge]
Where did you go? When the sun rose
Now I know, how to get off these dirt roads
To find these streets of gold
Where did you go? When the sun rose
Now I know how to get off these dirt roads
To find these streets of gold

[Chorus]
Walk on streets of gold, you walk on streets of gold
Walk on streets of gold, you walk on streets of gold
You walk on streets of gold
Walk on streets of gold
