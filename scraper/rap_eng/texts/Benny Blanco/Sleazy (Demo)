I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don’t need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

Get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy
Get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy
I’ma get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy
I'ma get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy

I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin’ like diamonds
Lookin’ like diamonds

You can't imagine the immensity of the fuck I’m not giving
About your money my servants and the mansion you live in
I don't wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just grab a bottle some boys and let's take it back to my basement

And get sleazy
Sick of all your lines so cheesy
Sorry daddy but I’m not that easy
I'm not gonna sit here while you circle-jerk-it and work it
I'ma take it back to where my man and my girls is

Sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy
'Cause I'ma get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy, get sleazy
'Cause I'ma get

I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so phat gonna make me come
All over your face
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so phat gonna make me come
All over your face

I don't mean to critique on your seduction technique
But but but your money's not impressin' me it's kinda weak
That that that you really think you're gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off by showing me the dollars in your drop-box

Me and all my friends we don't buy bottles we bring 'em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave 'em
And I don't care if you stare when you call us scummy
'Cause we ain't after your affection and sure as hell not your money honey

I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

I don't need you or your brand new Benz
Or your bougie friends
I don't need love lookin' like diamonds
Lookin' like diamonds

Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so phat gonna make me come
All over your face
Rat-a-tat-tat on your dum-dum drum
The beat's so phat gonna make me come
All over your face
