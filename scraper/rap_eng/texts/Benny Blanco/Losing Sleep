[Verse:]
It’s 3 AM, I’m calling in to tell you that without you here
I’m losing sleep
I’m losing sleep
Nervous, I’m around these lonely eyes, that’s leaving me filled with fear
I’m losing sleep
I’m losing sleep

[Pre-Chorus:1]
And I know what it's like
To be a child scared of the night

[Chorus:1]
Please don’t stop loving me, loving me
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Wanting me, wanting me like you do
Please don’t stop caring now, caring now
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Caring now, caring now like you do

[Verse:2]
I know you have to work out there, it’s for the best, but can’t you see?
I’m losing sleep
I’m losing sleep
Remember telling you to go, you’ve always done what’s good for me
I’m losing sleep
I’m losing sleep

[Pre-Chorus:2]
And I know what it's like
To be a child scared, so scared of the night

[Chorus:1]

[Break]
Running from the dark but I just can’t hide
Dreading sundown, yeah I’m dreading the night
Need you back here ‘cause it feels so wrong yeah

[Chorus:2]
Oh please don’t stop loving me, loving me
Whoa ooh ooh no no Whoa ooh ooh ooh ohh
Loving me, loving me like you do
Darling no oh oh oh
Please don’t stop caring now, caring now
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Caring now, caring now
(no oh ooh)

Please don’t stop loving me, loving me
No no no no no no no no
Wanting me, wanting me like you do

It’s 3 AM, I’m calling in to tell you that without you here
I’m losing sleep
I’m losing sleep
