[Verse 1]
I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
When you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasted my nights
Turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy-ever-after did exist
Then I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song and I'll be sick
And I'll be sick

[Verse 2]
You turned your back on tomorrow
And you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasted my nights
Turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?
If happy-ever-after did exist
Then I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song and I'll be sick
And I'll be sick

If happy-ever-after did exist
Then I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song and I'll be sick
And I'll be sick
