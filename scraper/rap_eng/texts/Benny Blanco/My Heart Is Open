[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I know you're scared, ooh, I can feel it
It's in the air, I know you feel that too
But take a chance on me, you won't regret it, no
One more 'no' and I'll believe you
I'll walk away and I will leave you be
And that's the last time you'll say no, say no to me

[Pre-Chorus 1: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
It won't take me long to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Gwen Stefani]
You don't ever say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Cause my heart is open
Now you gotta say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
It's just a moment, go and seize it
Don't be afraid to give your heart to me
And if you do, I know that I won't let you down, no
Yeah, so hand it over, trust me with your love
I'll do anything you want me to
'Cause I can't breathe until I see your face

[Pre-Chorus 2: Gwen Stefani & Adam Levine]
Ooh, and I don't need time to find another lover, but I want you
I can't spend another minute getting over loving you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Gwen Stefani]
You don't ever say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Cause my heart is open
Now you gotta say, yeah
Let me hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say, yeah
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Wanna hear you say
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
