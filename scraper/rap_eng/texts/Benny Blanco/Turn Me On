[Chorus]
Come and hold me
Wrap your arms 'round my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
Let me hold you
Wrap my arms all around you
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on

[Verse 1]
It's something about you I can't explain
When you around me, I can't contain myself
I don't know how you got the best of me
I want your loving like everyday
Uh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, come a little closer on my body
'Cause you know what I want
And baby, if I tell you "come over"
Get it popping
You know what I want

[Chorus]
Come and hold me
Wrap your arms 'round my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
Let me hold you
Wrap my arms all around you
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on

[Verse 2]
Once you latch on, baby, don't let go
We might never get the chance alone again
Promise you won't let nobody know
The things we do when the doors are closed
Uh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, come a little closer on my body (on my body)
'Cause you know what I want (yeah, yeah)
And baby, if I tell you "come over"
Get it popping (get it popping)
You know what I want

[Chorus]
Come and hold me
Wrap your arms 'round my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
Let me hold you
Wrap my arms all around you
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on (turn me on)

[Bridge]
Hold my body, hold my body (hey)
When you hold my body (yeah), you turn me on
When you hold my body, hold my body
When you hold my body, you turn me on

[Chorus]
Come and hold me
Wrap your arms 'round my body (body, yeah)
You got me going crazy (crazy)
You turn me on, turn me on (oh, oh)
Let me hold you
Wrap my arms all around you
You got me going crazy (you got me going crazy, yeah)
You turn me on, turn me on
Come and hold me
Wrap your arms 'round my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
Let me hold you
Wrap my arms all around you
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
