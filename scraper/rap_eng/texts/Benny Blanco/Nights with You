[Verse 1]
Girl, you're gorgeous
Even though you might not always feel like it, but you are, mmm
And you're worth it (Yeah)
I assure you I will dye my hair in crazy colors
Just to make you smile

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll take you out tonight
(Throw away your phone)
Don't care about your boyfriend waking up alone
I'll take you out tonight
(Leave it all at home)
Don't care about your boyfriend waking up alone
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I just wanna spend the nights with you
Do it like your mother said not to do
Every time I hear the phone ring
I feel the same thing, I feel the same thing, uh
I just wanna spend the nights with you
With you, with you, with you

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Hey)
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Lose attention
Even though the world is mad
And you feel out of control, uh
But you're the best thing
When you let it off, like bang your head
And put your hands up in the air, oh babe

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll take you out tonight
(Throw away your phone)
Don't care about your boyfriend waking up alone (No)
I'll take you out tonight
(Leave it all at home)
Don't care about your boyfriend waking up alone
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I just wanna spend the nights with you
Do it like your mother said not to do, uh
Every time I hear the phone ring
I feel the same thing, I feel the same thing, uh
I just wanna spend the nights with you
Oh, with you, with you, with you

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
(I just wanna spend the nights with you)
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Hey)
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
(I just wanna spend the nights with you)
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Hey)
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Hey)
