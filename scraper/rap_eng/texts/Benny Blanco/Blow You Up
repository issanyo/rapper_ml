[Verse 1: AlunaGeorge]
No indication
Of what lies in your dark side
You got no vindication
Cause you won’t keep yourself in line

[Pre-Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
I just wanna blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
Blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
I wanna blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
Blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up

[Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up, it’s on
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up, it’s on
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up, it’s on
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up

[Verse 2: AlunaGeorge]
You’re sick and catch me
By surprise, when I’m not so wise
Then I will get you, and show them
All that you’ve been hiding

[Pre-Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
I just wanna blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
Blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
I wanna blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
Blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up

[Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up, it’s on
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up, it’s on
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up, it’s on
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
(Run tune, my lord)

[Bridge: AlunaGeorge]
I just wanna blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
Blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
I wanna blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
Blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up

[Pre-Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
I just wanna blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
Blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
I wanna blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up
Blow you up, break you up
Smash you up, so I can wake you up

[Chorus: AlunaGeorge]
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up, it’s on
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up, it’s on
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up, it’s on
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
Blow you up, blow you up, blow you up
