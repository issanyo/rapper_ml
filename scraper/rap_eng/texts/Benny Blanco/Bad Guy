[Verse 1]
Spent so long just waiting for you here
To chew me up and spit me out and leave me alone
Took me even longer just to heal
Me, myself and nobody else, well I'll be gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the tables turn
You're missing me
You taught me how to hurt
He's kissing me
Beware, the bridge you burnt
Will running back to me, yeah

[Chorus]
I can be the one to keep you up at night
Tell me how it feels from the other side
I'll be on my own doin' what I like
God, it feels so good to be the bad guy
Be the bad guy

[Instrumental Break]

Be the bad guy
Be the bad guy

[Verse 2]
You were always standing in the way
Trip me up to keep me down and leave me alone
There're no excuse left to make
Me, myself and nobody else, I'm on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the tables turn
You're missing me
You taught me how to hurt
He's kissing me
Beware, the bridge you burnt
Will running back to me, yeah

[Chorus]
I can be the one to keep you up at night
Tell me how it feels from the other side
I'll be on my own doin' what I like
God, it feels so good to be the bad guy
Be the bad guy

[Instrumental Break]

Be the bad guy
Be the bad guy

[Outro]
I'll be on my own doin' what I like
I'll be on my own doin' what I like
I'll be on my own doin' what I like
God, it feels so good to be the bad guy
Be the bad guy
