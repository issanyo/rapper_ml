[Intro]
Tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe
Tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe

[Verse 1]
Here we are, getting close
Where this goes? no one knows
Don't be mad, we just met
[?]

[Pre-Chorus]
We can dance all night
And you can pick the song
I'll jump around to whatever's on the stereo
But when the lights go down and the music's gone
You take it slow round my heart you got to tip toe

[Chorus]
Please, please, please let me be gentle
If you want to go round my heart you got to tip toe
Please, please, please let me be careful
If you want to go round my heart you got to tip toe

[Post-Chorus]
Oh whoah you got to tip toe
Round my heart you got to tip toe
Oh whoah you got to tip toe
Round my heart you got to tip toe

[Verse 2]
You're not him, i'm not her
But we lived and we learn
Make it worse, break the way
Maybe trust everything you say

[Pre-Chorus]
We can dance all night
You can pick the song
I'll jump around to whatever's on the stereo
But when the lights go down and the music's gone
Take it slow round my heart you got to tip toe

[Chorus]
Please, please, please let me be gentle
If you want to go round my heart you got to tip toe
Please, please, please let me be careful
If you want to go round my heart you got to tip toe

[Bridge]
Tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe
(Oh whoah you got to tip toe)
Tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip toe
(Round my heart you got to tip toe)

[Outro]
Tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip tip toe, tip toe
Tip toe, tip tip toe, tip toe, tip toe
Tip tip toe, tip toe, tip toe, tip
Toe
