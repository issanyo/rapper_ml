[Verse 1]
Tell me what does it take to make good now
How many years do you wait?
Oh, and now all of the clouds are combining
The flickering light's just a flame
Oh but yeah, I'm so tired
I've been away for so many years
But I guess I'll just wait a bit longer
I'll stay 'til they open the gates

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life I stay here waiting
Every new year, always making me
Feel as though there's nothing up there but
One day you came out of nowhere

[Chorus]
1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart then you appeared
Dropped from the heavens, they call me a dreamer
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here
Lifted off the ground
I took your hands and pulled you down
Because 1985 was a good year
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here

[Verse 2]
Oh well, how many years has it been now?
How many days went to waste?
Now the rain and the thunder are clashing
The Sun's got a smile 'cross the face
Oh, but yeah I'm so tired
I fight so hard and come back beaten
Beacon, burn through it brightly
Soared through a sliver of space

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]
All my life I stay here waiting
Every new year, always making me
Feel as though there's nothing up there but
One day you came out of nowhere
1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart then you appeared
Dropped from the heavens, they call me a dreamer
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here
Lifted off the ground
I took your hands and pulled you down
Because 1985 was a good year
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here

[Bridge]
Lifted up
Lift us back to the sky and the world above
Lifted up
Lifted up

[Chorus]
1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart then you appeared
Dropped from the heavens, they call me a dreamer
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here
Lifted off the ground
I took your hands and pulled you down
Because 1985 was a good year
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here
