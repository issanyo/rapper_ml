[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Toned, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
(Uh!) The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie
Katy, my lady (Yeah?)
Lookie here, baby (Uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representing California (Ooh ooh)
West coast

[Hook: Katy Perry & (Snoop Dogg)]
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, uh huh
(West coast)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Hook: Katy Perry]
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, uh huh
Uhh
Yeah, uh huh
Yeah, hey

[Chorus: Katy Perry & (Snoop Dogg)]
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Now put your hands up [x5]
Now put your hands up, hands up, hands up....
(West coast)
