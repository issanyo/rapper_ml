Wake up in the morning, feelin' like P. Diddy
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back

I'm talking pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowing up our phones, phones
Trying to get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh

I'm talking about everybody getting crunk, crunk
Boys trying to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

Now the party don't start till I walk in

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight

Tik tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh
