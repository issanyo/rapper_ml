Honey, don't waste your time
I know you love, get to the back of the line
Honey, don't make me say it again
Cause I'm gonna count to one and count to two, one, two
Imma chew you up and spit you out and blow your house down, I'll blow your house down, I'll blow your house down
Imma chew you up and spit you out and blow your house down, I'll blow your house down, I'll blow your house down

Honey, you know I never let you (uh)
That makes you love me a little bit more
Honey, don't make me say it again
Cause I'm gonna count to one and count to two, one, two
Imma chew you up and spit you out and blow your house down, I'll blow your house down, I'll blow your house down
Imma chew you up and spit you out and blow your house down, I'll blow your house down, I'll blow your house down

Well, the first little boy thought that he was the shit
And the second boy tried to sneak me a kiss
And the third little boy, he just bought me a drink
And they all went home alone, all went home alone, and they all went home alone, and they all went home alone, and they all went home alone

Imma chew you up and spit you out and blow your house down, I'll blow your house down, I'll blow your house down
Imma chew you up and spit you out and blow your house down, I'll blow your house down, I'll blow your house down

Imma chew you up and spit you out and blow your house down, I'll blow your house down, I'll blow your house down
Imma chew you up and spit you out and blow your house down, I'll blow your house down, I'll blow your house down
