You plus me
That's all we need
Baby, you plus me
That's all we need
So just let yourself go
Into that place we know
Everything moves slow
Until we lose control
Now can you feel that heat
When our bodies meet
Oh it's like chemistry
Baby, it's you plus me

You plus me, you plus me, you plus me, you plus me
You plus me, you plus me, you plus me, you plus me

You plus me
That's all we need
Baby, you plus me
That's all we need
So just let yourself go
Into that place we know
Everything moves slow
Until we lose control
Now can you feel that heat
When our bodies meet
Oh it's like chemistry
Baby, it's you plus me

(What)

You plus me, you plus me
You plus me, you plus me
You plus me, you plus me
You plus me, you plus me

You plus me
That's all we need
Baby, you plus me
That's all we need
So just let yourself go
Into that place we know
Everything moves slow
Until we lose control
Now can you feel that heat
When our bodies meet
Oh it's like chemistry
Baby, it's you plus me
