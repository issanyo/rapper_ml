[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
I forgot the feeling
The feeling of being alone but not lonely
I guess when you touch me
My fears and my secrets belong to you only
Close the door behind you
Just let me love you, just go with you, hold you
My mind stays on you
So does my body, let me show you

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
But I wanna come through
And I wanna need you
Could you be my muse?
Lately all I think about is you
And I'm never sick about it

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
This love's incredible-credible
Have a little mercy on me, baby, you got me
Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love-ove
It's incredible-credible
Have a little mercy on me, baby, you got me
Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love-ove

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
I know you've been hurt
By the way that you look away
From me too early
You don't like to talk about it
And that's fine, I get it
So don't worry

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
But I wanna come through
And I wanna need you
Could you be my muse?
Lately all I think about is you
I'm never sick about it

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
This love's incredible-credible
Have a little mercy on me, baby, you got me
Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love-ove
It's incredible-credible
Have a little mercy on me, baby, you got me
Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love-ove

[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love
Wanting more, wanting more
Of your love
This love
Wanting more, wanting more
Love Incredi-ble

[Outro]
Your love
Your love
Love Incredi-ble
Your love
Your love
Love
