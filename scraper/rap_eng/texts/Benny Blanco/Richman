[Intro: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
I mean what can I say?
Pretty babies in the backseat singin’ to you
Hey DJ, won’t you play that song for me?
And my hom—and my homies all singing to it
3OH... 3OH!3

[Verse 1: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
I ain’t callin’ for a close-up
No clubs, no cars
Bitches with the nose jobs
No dubs, no stars
I’ma do it how I always have
Whiskey in a 40 bag
Pissin’ in the alleyway
Out back of where the party’s at
I’ma spend it on a new whip
New hat, new kicks
Bitches with the huge tits
New gat, new slips
I’ma do it how I always do
Sleep until the break of noon
Wakin’ up just to make it through
Another night of shakin’ you

[Chorus: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
I mean what can I say?
Pretty babies in the backseat singin’ to you
Hey DJ, won’t you play that song for me?
And turn it up on your radio
I got 200 seconds and I'm ready to go
I mean what can I say?
Pretty babies in the backseat singin' to you
Hey DJ, won’t you play that song for me?
And turn it up on your radio
I got 200 seconds and I’m ready to go

[Verse 2: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
I ain’t signing on a new lease
No cooks, no keys
Models with the nose bleeds
White lace, gold beads
I’ma run it like a marathon
Party ‘til I’m 50
Wake up on my parent’s lawn
Them cops still out to get me
And I ain’t sippin’ on a mixed drink
Pinkie out, lips pink
Talking to a rich skank
Filled up like a sperm bank
I’ma go where I always go
Drinks are on the house
Whiskey’s on the rocks
While your sister’s on my mouth

[Chorus: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
I mean what can I say?
Pretty babies in the backseat singin’ to you
Hey DJ, won’t you play that song for me?
And turn it up on your radio
I got 200 seconds and I'm ready to go
I mean what can I say?
Pretty babies in the backseat singin' to you
Hey DJ, won’t you play that song for me?
And turn it up on your radio
I got 200 seconds and I’m ready to go

[Bridge: Nathaniel Motte]
And if I was a rich man
I’d never been to sea
Could I take you anyways
Or would you come with me, baby?
And if I was a sick man
I’d never meant to be
Would you love me anyways
And would you marry me?

[Chorus: Sean Foreman & Nathaniel Motte]
I mean what can I say?
Pretty babies in the backseat singin’ to you
Hey DJ, won’t you play that song for me?
And turn it up on your radio
I got 200 seconds and I'm ready to go
I mean what can I say?
Pretty babies in the backseat singin' to you
Hey DJ, won’t you play that song for me?
And turn it up on your radio
I got 200 seconds and I’m ready to go
I mean what can I say?
Pretty babies in the backseat singin’ to you
Hey DJ, won’t you play that song for me?
And turn it up on your radio
I got 200 seconds and I'm ready to go
I mean what can I say?
Pretty babies in the backseat singin' to you
Hey DJ, won’t you play that song for me?
And turn it up on your radio
I got 200 seconds and I’m ready to go
