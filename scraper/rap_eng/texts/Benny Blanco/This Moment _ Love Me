Part I: This Moment

[Verse 1]
Can you tell me, who called a race?
Can anyone stay in one place?
And when you get to the finish line
Will you wish for more time?
But see, one day
One day you will
But maybe one day you will find
That you just can’t push rewind

[Chorus]
All we have is this moment
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

[Bridge]
Be here with me now
'Cause the future is right now, right in front on you
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do
Our future is right now, I'm in front of you
Baby, don't blink and miss this moment

[Chorus]
Tomorrow's unspoken
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
All we have is this moment
To put a love into motion
Yesterday is history
So why don't you be here with me?
Be here with me now

Part II: Love Me

[Verse 1]
I lost myself in fear of losing you
I wish I didn’t do, but I did
I lost my own, my own identity
Forgot that you picked me for me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But now, I don’t negotiate with insecurities
They always seem to get the best of me
I found I had to love myself the way I wanted you to
Love me

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I’m gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself the way I want you to love me

[Bridge]
No more standing in my own way
(Let's get deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way
(The way I want you to love me)
No more standing in my own way
(Let's get deeper, let's get closer)
No more standing in my own way
(The way I want you to love me)

[Chorus]
No more second-guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I’m gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
No more second-guessing
No, there’s no more questioning
I’ll be the one defining who I’m gonna be
No concealing feelings
Or changing seasonally
I’m gonna love myself the way I want you to love me
