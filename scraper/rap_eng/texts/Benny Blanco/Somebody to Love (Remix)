[Verse 1: Usher]
For you, I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, it's time to sink or swim
Watch them play for you
For you I'd be running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
I don't need a whole lot, but coming from you, I admit I'd Rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

[Chorus: Usher]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love, girl
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I, I need somebody
I need somebody, I, I need somebody to love

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Every day, I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds
Smile for me
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime
Step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I don't need a whole lot, but coming from you, I admit I'd rather give you the world or you can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

[Chorus: Usher]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love, girl
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love (I need somebody, I, I need somebody)
I don't need too much, just somebody to love, girl
Somebody to love (I need somebody, I I need somebody)
I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love

[Bridge: Usher with Justin Bieber]
And you can have it all, anything you want
I can bring, give you the finer things, girl
But what I really want, I can't find
'Cause money can't find me
Somebody to love
Find me somebody to love, oh

[Chorus: Usher]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love, girl
Somebody to love, I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love (I need somebody, I, I need somebody)
I don't need too much, just somebody to love, girl
Somebody to love (I need somebody, I I need somebody)
I don't need nothing else
I promise, girl, I swear, I just need somebody to love

[Outro: Usher & Justin Bieber]
I need somebody, I need somebody
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody to love
Need somebody to love
I just need somebody to love
