(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
All I want are hooks to hang your flowers from
And paper to write letters on
Cause you're all I'll ever...

[Chorus]
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have (it's all I'll ever)

[Verse 2]
When we wake up you engulf me in your love
Waking up is always tough, it's all I'll ever...

[Chorus]
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have (it's all I'll ever)

[Verse 3]
And all you need
Is someone who sees what you can't see
The things you'll never think you'll be
That's all I'll ever...

[Chorus]
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have (it's all I'll ever)

[Bridge]
I get the notion that I'm almost there
I get the notion that we're getting closer
And with one motion it could all go wrong
If I'm emotional I'll ruin it all
And the roof will cave in and fall to the ground
And I'll keep on trying though I could never let you down, no I
It's all I'll ever...

[Chorus]
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have (it's all I'll ever)

[Chorus]
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have, it's all I'll ever
Have (it's all I'll ever)

[Outro]
I promise this
After each moment, just a kiss
On your cheek or on your lips
That's all we'll ever have
