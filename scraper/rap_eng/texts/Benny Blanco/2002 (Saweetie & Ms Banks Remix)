[Verse 1: Saweetie]
Ooh, I think they like me
Icy on a white tee
I swear, I surf
(You) couldn't wife me
Baby hairs laid, baby fat and some Nike's
Wanna be my lover, then you gotta keep it spicy
Smile for me daddy, 'cause I wanna see your grill
Ain't no brother boo's here, no, I like 'em hella real
I'm the number one stunna, wha-wha-wha-what?
I'm a big timer bitch, I run the bill up
(Icy)

[Verse 2 : Anne-Marie]
I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)
Uh, we were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods (Hey)
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs

[Verse 3: Ms Banks]
Hey ma (wassup?)
It's right (alright)
Decide, we can do it tonight
Reminisce till it's light
No, you're feeling me right
We used to  be on a high
You never had the time
We was rushing to grow but finding out, yeah
Uh huh, spending your money
Just to build your credit (ok)
Always in me is the older life of stealing
My overtime is revealing
Now we're just always dreaming of

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh, ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 4 : Ms Banks]
I mean I was so young
And you was so sprung
Sippin' on capri-sun
Like it was white rum
Could never get enough
And I needed your love
Man, you were so tough
Used to play Five [?]
We used to sing 'My Neck, My Back'
But we was too young to be singing that
If my mum heard
Would've beat me for that
Never even had a back
It was my fave track
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh, ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh, ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh, ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh, ooh
On the day we fell in love, love, love
