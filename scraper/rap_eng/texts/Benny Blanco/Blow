[Intro]
Dance

[Verse 1]
Back door cracked, we don't need a key
We get in for free
No VIP sleaze
Drink that Kool-Aid, follow my lead
Now you're one of us
You're coming with me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's time to kill the lights and shut the DJ down
(This place about to)
Tonight we're taking over, no one's getting out

[Chorus]
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to

[Verse 2]
Now what?  (What)
We're taking control
We get what we want
We do what you don't
Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's time to lose your mind and let the crazy out
(This place about to)
Tonight we're takin' names, 'cause we don't mess around

[Chorus]
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to

[Bridge]
Go-go-go-go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes
Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes

[Interlude]
We are taking over
Get used to it, okay?

[Chorus]
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Blow (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
This place about to blow
