[Chorus]
This summer, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
This summer, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
This summer, I'm doin' me

[Verse 2]
Call me Neon cos I shine like day glow
I'll be lighting up the sky tonight
What I told you, I could F U Betta
Peace to both of you, now it's my time
I go to London, to Paris, New York and Miami
My heart has recovered now life is a party
Not looking for no one cos I am my own woman

[Chorus]
This summer, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
This summer, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
This summer, I'm doin' me
