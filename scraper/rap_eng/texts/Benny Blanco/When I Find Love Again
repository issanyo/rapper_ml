[Verse 1]
Hey oh, where can I go
When all the roads I take they never lead me home
Hey oh, I miss you so
But I'm used to seeing people come and go

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I've made mistakes
Next time, I swear I'll change

[Chorus]
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll be much better than the man I used to be
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll have a better plan for us

[Verse 2]
Hey oh, I'm not ashamed
Cause everybody has a heart that's meant to break
Hey oh, don't be afraid
Ð¡ause you're only get stronger from the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I've made mistakes
Next time, I swear I'll change

[Chorus 2]
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll be much better than the man I used to be
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll have a better plan for us
Yeah, you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I've made mistakes
Next time, I swear I'll change

[Chorus 2]
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll be much better than the man I used to be
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll have a better plan for us
Yeah, you and me

[Chorus]
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll be much better than the man I used to be
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll have a better plan for us

[Chorus]
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll be much better than the man I used to be
When I find love again, when I find love again
I'll have a better plan for us
