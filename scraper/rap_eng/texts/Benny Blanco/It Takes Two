[Verse 1]
Is Mercury in retrograde?
Or is that the excuse that I've always made?
'Cause I want to blame you
But I can only blame myself
Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus
Or call you crazy, while filling my cup
I say these things to hurt you
But I only hurt myself

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I can only take responsibility for me

[Chorus]
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry"

[Verse 2]
I've faced my demons, yeah, I paid my dues
I had to grow up, I wish you could too
I wanted to save you
But I can only save myself

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I can only be the change I want to see
Yeah, to see

[Chorus]
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry"

[Bridge]
I point my finger but it does me no good
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth, yeah
Why are these lessons always learned the hard way?
Is it too late to change?

[Chorus]
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just you
I can't keep ignoring
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah
It takes two
Two sides to every story
Not just me
You can't keep ignoring
But let me be first, baby, to say "I'm sorry"
