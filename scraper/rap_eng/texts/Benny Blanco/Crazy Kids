[Chorus]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Verse 1]
I see ya in the club showing Ke$ha love
Ain't trippin' on them bitches that be hatin'
Catch a dub, chuck a deuces
Y'all hatin's useless
It's such a nuisance
Y'all chickens keep your two cents
And keep your dollars, keep your loot
I'm fresher than that Gucci
Them boys, they want my coochie
I say "Nope, I'm no hoochie"
Your homegirl hatin'
I say "Who she?"
Ke$ha don't give two fucks
I came to start the ruckus
And ya wanna party with us
Cause we crazy motherfuckas

[Chorus]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Verse 2]
You see us in the place tripping off the bass
D-D-DJ rock a beat, make the fucker shake
Like an earthquake, like an earthquake
Booty pop
All my shorties on the dance floor
Make your heart stop
Stop your cardiac, sipping Cognac in the back
Th-they ch-chasing my kitty cat
They know my zodiac, I'm no virgin or no Virgo
I'm crazy, that's my word though
It's Ke$ha in the casa
Baby, let-let's make it loco

[Chorus]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people

[Bridge]
This is all we've got and then it's gone
You call us the crazy ones
But we gon' keep on dancing 'til the dawn
'Cause you know the party never ends
And tomorrow we gonna do it again
We the ones that play hard, we live hard
We love hard, we light up the dark

[Chorus]
Hello, wherever you are
Are you dancing on the dance floor or drinking by the bar?
Tonight we do it big and shine like stars
And we don't give a fuck 'cause that's just who we are
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
Them crazy, them crazy kids
And we are, we are, we are, we are, we are the crazy kids
We are the, we are the crazy people
