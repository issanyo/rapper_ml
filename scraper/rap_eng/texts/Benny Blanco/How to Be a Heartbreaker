Rule number one
Is that you gotta have fun
But baby when you're done
You gotta be the first to run

Rule number two
Just don't get attached to
Somebody you could lose
So le-let me tell you

This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing I lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing I lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you

Rule number three
Wear your heart on your cheek
But never on your sleeve
UnIess you wanna taste defeat

Rule number four
Gotta be looking pure
Kiss him goodbye at the door
And leave him wanting more, more

This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing I lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing I lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
Cause I lo-lo-love you

[RACHEL]
Girls, we do, whatever it will take
'Cause girls don't want
We don't want our hearts to break in two
So it's better to be fake

[BRODY & RACHEL]
Can't risk losing in love again, ba-abe

This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing I lo-lo-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger
A player, singing I lo-lo-love you

Ooooooo, ooooooo, ooooooo
Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you

[RACHEL]
At least I think I do
