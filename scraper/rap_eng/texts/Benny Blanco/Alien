[Verse 1]
I see you looking right through me
Like you think you knew me
But you don't have word to say, word to say
If this [?] paper and you might just hate her
But that would be a mistake, a mistake
Would you do me a favor and just be a neighbour
I'm tired of feeling like i'm from another world

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all of this distance has got me in prison oh

[Chorus]
I feel like an alien
Feeling like an alien
I can go insane
I'm not the only one, i'm not the only one
Who feels like an alien
Feeling like an alien
I can go insane
I'm not the only one, i'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
Have you ever wished for something and left out for being
Just who you wanna be, wanna be
Have you ever been so lonely like you were the only
One who you'd ever need, ever need
Yeah it seems like insanity but now it's reality
And so you see that you are really just like me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause all of this distance has got me in prison oh

[Chorus]
I feel like an alien
Feeling like an alien
I can go insane
I'm not the only one, i'm not the only one
Who feels like an alien
Feeling like an alien
I can go insane
I'm not the only one, i'm not the only one

[Bridge]
If they keep on tryin to bring us down just be you
Even in the dark without no stars I see you
If they keep on tryin to bring us down just be you
Even in the dark without no stars I see you
If they keep on tryin to bring us down just be you

[Chorus]
I feel like an alien
Feeling like an alien
I can go insane
I'm not the only one, i'm not the only one
Who feels like an alien
Feeling like an alien
I can go insane
I'm not the only one, i'm not the only one
