[Intro: The Weeknd & (Cashmere Cat)]
So long, I've lost a friend (chill)
So long, I've lost a friend (chill)
So long, I've lost a friend (chill)
So long, I've lost a friend (chill)
So long, I've lost a friend (chill)
So long, I've lost a friend (yeah)
So long, I've lost a friend (chill)
So long, I've lost a friend

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Hold your body, every night
Hold your body (chill)
Hold your body, every night
Hold your body all night (chill)
Hold the waist, give the brain for like half a day
Till she motionless, till she motionless
Wipe the sweat, kiss the chest, cause she's not the same
And you touch, you, babe

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Till you're motionless
And your body gettin' numb from the sex and the rum
Till she motionless
You just wanna be with me
Till you're motionless
And your body get numb, you just wanna be touched
Till you're motionless, till you're motionless

[Outro: Cashmere Cat & The Weeknd]
Chill
Chill
Chill
Chill
Chill
Chill
Chill
