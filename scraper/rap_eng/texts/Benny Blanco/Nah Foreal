[Intro]
Ayy, yeah, ew
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Nah for real, fuck how a broke nigga feel
Nah for real, she tryna live for the thrill
Nah for real, she comin' straight out the hills, yeah
Nah for real, pour up a cup 'til it spill

[Verse]
Go get a bag, run it up
Don't got no time for a slut
Smoking and drinking too much
Backwoods for breakfast and lunch
I do this shit on the regular
Want the OG, not the regular
Don't want that bitch if she regular
Treat the Hi-Tech like it's medicine
Check out the Rollie, it's president
Still for the bitches, you celibate
You not the plug, boy you selling it
You not the plug (for real)
Walk in the club and spent a dub, come from the mud
Came out the mud, step in the crib, Bape on the rug

[Chorus]
Nah for real, fuck how a broke nigga feel
Nah for real, she tryna live for the thrill
Nah for real, she comin' straight out the hills, yeah
Nah for real, pour up a cup 'til it spill
