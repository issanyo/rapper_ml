[Verse 1]
Yeah, you gotta let it go 'cause we're losing grip now
It's about to go down
Would you let me talk to you?
You gotta let me know
'Cause I'm on the edge now of a nervous breakdown
'Cause I can't get through to you, you

[Chorus]
I got my hands up, screaming
Got my hands up, screaming
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot

[Verse 2]
You never let me go
Got me chained to your touch, like a slave for your love
I'm ashamed to say it's true, oh
Afraid to let you go, cause without you, I'm lost
And not matter the cost, I'll be standing next to you, oh

[Chorus]
I got my hands up, screaming
Got my hands up, screaming
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot

[Bridge]
My back's against the wall tonight
So go ahead pull the trigger, shoot the lights off
Go ahead, pull the trigger, shoot the lights off
I see the fear that's in your eyes
So go ahead, pull the trigger, shoot the lights off
Go ahead, pull the trigger, shoot

[Chorus]
I got my hands up, screaming
Got my hands up, screaming
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby, don't shoot
