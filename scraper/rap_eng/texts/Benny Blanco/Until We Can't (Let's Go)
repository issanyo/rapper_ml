[Verse 1]
How much can we take before we both break down?
The confines of these rooms, yeah they get you too
Lying in our bed while tossing and turning
And it wakes you up, it puts you in the mood
But that's alright cause
We both know what the other wants
And it goes to show why we're not alone
And still we're here in this God forsaken place
I can hear what you're saying, I can see it on your face

[Chorus]
So let's go, let's go 'til we can't anymore
Let's go 'til we can't
Let's go, let's go 'til we fall to the floor
Let's go 'til we can't
Somebody else told me something about
Where you live can cause you suffering
Guess that's something else that's wrong with our room
With the walls colliding
Someone said stop hesitating
We both know we're suffocating
Let's go out and find ourselves a home
And find ourselves a home

[Verse 2]
Honey please, you don't need to tell me
What we need, yeah we both know that
Our bedroom floor with our clothes strewn all about
Yeah we're stuffed in here together begging for a new way out

[Chorus]
So let's go, let's go 'til we can't anymore
Let's go 'til we can't
Let's go, let's go 'til we fall to the floor
Let's go 'til we can't
Somebody else told me something about
Where you live can cause you suffering
Guess that's something else that's wrong with our room
With the walls colliding
Someone said stop hesitating
We both know we're suffocating
Let's go out and find ourselves a home
And find ourselves a home

[Bridge]
We can barely speak, we can barely sleep
Now we'll even barely take the time, take the time to try
Try to make this living hell, break this barren shell
Shell it out for something better than we'd think and better than we'd ever dream

[Chorus]
So let's go, let's go 'til we can't anymore
Let's go 'til we can't
Let's go, let's go 'til we fall to the floor
Let's go 'til we can't
Somebody else told me something about
Where you live can cause you suffering
Guess that's something else that's wrong with our room
With the walls colliding
Someone said stop hesitating
We both know we're suffocating
Let's go out and find ourselves a home
And find ourselves a home
