[Verse 1]
There is no God
There are no rules
But I wish there was something that I could do

[Chorus]
No, you'll never go back in...time
Why you think so?
No, you'll never go back in...time
And you can't see the future
You could come back home

[Verse 2]
I see a vision of us two
You're taking pictures and I'm in the pool

[Chorus]
No, you'll never go back in...time
Why you think so?
No, you'll never go
And you can't see the future
You could come back

[Outro]
No, you'll never go back
No, you'll never go back in...time
