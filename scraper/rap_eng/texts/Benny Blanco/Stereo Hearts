[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artefacts

[Pre-Chorus 1: Travie McCoy]
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no— (Yeah)
Oh—ote (Yeah, yeah, come on)
Make me your radio (Uh-uh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
Oh, oh oh-oh, oh
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo
Let's go!

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travie McCoy]
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close (Listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh)
Make me your radio (Come on)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo (Sing along like)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (Yeah, yeah, come on)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh, oh)
Make me your radio (Ah-huh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[Outro: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Haha)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh
Oh oh oh-oh (To my stereo) (Let's go)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh
Oh, oh-oh (It's your boy, Travie)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh
(Gym Class Heroes, baby) Just sing along to my stereo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
