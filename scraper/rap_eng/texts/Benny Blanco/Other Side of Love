Baby you don't have to keep looking through my phone
If something's going on girl you'd already know
We can't even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here....baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here? baby, I gotta know

Hey baby girl longevity
It's a thing that you get with love, trust and good livity
So listen me and just believe
And let us stop going on like we are enemy
Cause most definite without you in my life
Girl it would desperate cause I can't forget
All the times when you had my back

Gal you give me many strength 100%
So I represent, and you represent

Gal you heaven sent, have ma first baby
I told you girl when you first met me
It's a crazy world, nothing come free

Baby, you don't have to keep looking through my phone
If something's going on, girl you'd already know
We can't even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here? baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here? baby, I gotta know

Girl I remember when you first gave it up
And we began to first live it up
I'll steer it up, I'll gear it up
We came to love with no fear in us
But now you ain't seeing it clear enough

And tell me you want me to swear

I told you girl, when you first met me
It's a crazy world, nothing come free

How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here? baby, I gotta know
