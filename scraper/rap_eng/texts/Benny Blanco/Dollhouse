[Verse 1]
I'm just a girl and you're just a boy
This is my heart, it's not a toy
So what's with you playing with my mind?
We used to be cool, this used to be love
Now it's become something like a job
Like it or not
Maybe things were changing right before out eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to be your picture-perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Tryna control me like some kind of Barbie
But that just ain't me

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
You're way too old to be
Putting me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
No, I could never be
Stuck living like this
Behind these four walls
'Cause I ain't a doll

[Verse 2]
You call the shots right down to my shoes
I liked what you liked 'cause you told me to
And I don't think that you could even tell
I fell out of love, but it never showed
I gave up on us so long ago
But you'll never know
Baby, don't pretend like you know me so well

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried to be your picture-perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Tryna control me like some kind of Barbie
But that just ain't me

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'm not a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
You're way too old to be
Putting me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
No, I could never be
Stuck living like this
Behind these four walls
'Cause I ain't a doll

[Bridge]
I'll never be made of plastic
So glad that my heart's elastic
No matter what you do, I'll bounce back off of you
Cut me, but I'm not bleeding

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I tried to be your picture-perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Tryna control me like some kind of Barbie
But that just ain't me

[Chorus 2]
I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
You're way too old to be
Putting me down like this
And playing around like this
I ain't a doll, this ain't a dollhouse
No, I could never be
Stuck living like this
Behind these four walls
'Cause I ain't a doll

[Outro]
And I come with imperfections
Epitome of perfection
If you can't understand loving the way I am
Then you're no good for me, so glad I kept my receipt
