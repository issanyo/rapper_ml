[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
And you say that I'm the devil you know
And I don't disagree, no, I don't see the harm
They say, "You crazy, just leave him, he'll suffocate you"
But I wanna be in your arms

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
They say, "No, don't pick up the phone, let them think there's nobody home"
But I'm under your spell
'Cause when you call my heart starts to roll
I always want more
It's my heaven, my hell

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
We're heading deep
Inside lives a voice, a voice so quiet
But I can't hear that voice when your heart beats next to mine

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande]
When you said, "Baby, I just want you to lay me down and we'll fuck the pain away"
'Cause skin on skin, I feel nothing but the burning of desire
And that's just foreplay

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
We're heading deep
Inside lives a voice, a voice, so quiet
But I can't hear that voice when your heart beats next to mine

[Break: Ariana Grande]
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
I can't quit you
