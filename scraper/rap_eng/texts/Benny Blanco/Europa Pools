[Intro]

[Verse 1: Kacy Hill]
With you here, I am home
But here won't last too long
The hardest love is when you're gone, no
With you here, I am home
But here won't last too long
The hardest love is when you're gone, no

[Verse 2: Kacy Hill]
Tell me everythingâ€™s in you baby
And all your welcoming words never phase me
Keep running back to the last time
Your hazy, welcoming eyes were my safety
Tell me everything that you gave me
Till swooning blankets of stars take your way from me
Keep running back to the last time
Your hazy welcoming eyes were my safety
