[Verse 1]
There is the sun that I belong to
There hangs a light that comes and shines upon you
Bear off the warmth, Bear off reminders of youth
Oh we can't stay here
Tear down the moon and all its mockery
There is the sun that takes away our money
The night is deafening and brings on defeat
No we can't stay here, no I can't stay here
No I can't stay here

[Chorus]
Someone told me that I've run too far away, away
Someone told me I should just give in and stay, and stay
Oh come and celebrate, we're dancing on the grave
Of the nights we couldn't sleep, or I can't stay here

[Verse 2]
Don't steal away all of her beauty
Take down the darkness bruising both of your knees
It better overwhelm the heart with the heat
Or I can't stay here, no we can't stay here
No I can't stay here

[Chorus]
Someone hold me as I turn the night away, away
Someone hold me to the ultraviolet rays, arrays
Oh come and celebrate, yeah we're dancing on the grave
Of the nights we couldn't sleep, or I can't stay here
No I can't stay here, no I can't stay here
