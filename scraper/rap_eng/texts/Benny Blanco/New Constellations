[Verse 1]
I can only imagine the day that they said
"No, the world isn't flat, it's a circle instead
You can ride to wherever you want to now"
And those dizzy stargazers who dreamed of the black
Kept their heads in the clouds and they never looked back
They kept wandering and never did they look down

[Chorus 1]
Charting Neptune by the fire of the Sun
Kept looking for new constellations, new constellations

[Verse 2]
There's no walls and no ceilings as far as I know
Just the echoes of scars and the unbeaten road
Trip the gun on cautions that I've been sold
Cause it's hard to believe that it's wrong to want more
Than the truest of blue and a love like a roar
I will run to wherever I want to go, oh

[Chorus 2]
Charting Neptune by the fire of the Sun
I'm looking for new constellations, new constellations

[Verse 3]
So keep callin' me crazy cause I never learned
You should stop loving fire because you got burned
Now it feels like I'm living some sick déjà vu
Like the answers were there when I stared into you

[Chorus 3]
Child of Neptune, I'm the daughter of the Sun
Keep showing me new constellations, new constellations

[Bridge]
You can run
You can run
You can run if you want to
If you want to, you know
You can run
You can run
You can run if you want to
If you want to, you know
You can run
You can run
You can run if you want to
If you want to, you know
You can run
You can run
You can run if you want to
If you want to, you know

[Outro]
If there's more
If there's more
What if there's more?
What if there's more?
What if there's just a little bit more?
What if there's more? What if there's more?
