For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You thing you broke my heart
Oh girl, for goodness sake
You think i'm crying, on my own, well, i ain't
And i didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't wanna anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I've been moving on
And I think you should be something I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mom don't like you and she likes everyone
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
And I've never like to admit that I was wrong
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good

And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that i'm still holding on to something
You should go and love yourself
Say you'll never let me go

Taking it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone
But then his hands roamed
I turned him to gold and it took him higher
Oh, I'll be your daydream
I'll be your favourite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life
I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go

Cause if you like
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time
You look that much
Only we knew hideaway
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that i'm still holding on to something
(We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway)
You should go and love yourself

Remember when we hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in the Hospital room
You start crying, baby i did too
When the Sun came up I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said I'm setting you free
The monsters turned out to be just trees
And the Sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet, good

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that i'm still holding on to something

Cause if you like
(Deep in my bones, I can feel you, Take me back to a time)
You look that much
(Only we knew hideaway)
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that i'm still holding on to something
(We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway)
You should go and love yourself
Say you'll never let me go

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that i'm still holding on to something
You should go and love yourself
