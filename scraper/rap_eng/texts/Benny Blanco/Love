[Verse 1]
Look at you kids with your vintage music
Coming through satellites while we're cruising
You're part of the past
But now you're the future
Signal's crossing
Can get confusing

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy
Crazy, crazy, sometimes
It's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus]
You get ready
You get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work, or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter
'Cause it's enough to be young and in love
To be young and in love

[Verse 2]
Look at you kids
You know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse it

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy
Crazy, crazy, I know
It's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus]
You get ready
You get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work, or the coffee shop
It don't matter
Because it's enough to be young and in love
To be young and in love

[Bridge]
Don't worry, baby
Don't worry, baby

[Chorus]
I get ready
I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love
I'm young and in love
