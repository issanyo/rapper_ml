[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
Yeah, feel better (ayy)
Drinkin' Henny out the bottle (woo, ayy, yah)
I just fucked your bitch, it made me feel better (ayy)
Woke up right next to a model (damn, woo, ooh)
I just left the bank, it made me feel better (yeah)
Hi-Tech red, my cup dirty (mud, yeah)
Popped two 'Xans ('Xans), got me slurry (got me slurry)
Wake up and get that cash, I'm up early (I'm up early)
When I put this ice on, it make me feel better (ayy)

[Verse 1: Trill Sammy]
Diamonds Aquafina, look like water (bitch, drip, drip, drip)
[?], Gucci on my collar (bitch, Gucci)
I just want the blue face huniids an' I still won't call her (yeah, hmm)
Boujee lil' bitch around me, hope it ain't your daughter (ayy, yah)
I be hitting up the bank regularly (regularly)
I got bitches in Beverly (Hills)
Kicked us out the hotel (yeah), till' we smokin' to heavily (okay)
I count that cash, make me feel better (cash)
Diamonds on me change the weather (drip, drip)
Livin' life like Hugh Hefner (Trill)

[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
Yeah, feel better (ayy)
Drinkin' Henny out the bottle (woo, ayy, yah)
I just fucked your bitch, it made me feel better (ayy)
Woke up right next to a model (damn, woo, ooh)
I just left the bank, it made me feel better (yeah)
Hi-Tech red, my cup dirty (mud, yeah)
Popped two 'Xans ('Xans), got me slurry (got me slurry)
Wake up and get that cash, I'm up early (I'm up early)
When I put this ice on, it make me feel better (ayy)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Boy you come fuck with me any day, every day
I'm eatin' good like a heavy-weight (niggas can't fuck with me)
Get left behind on that pussy chase
I chase the bank like it's tryna escape (I run it up)
Bitch, I ain't good I’m great
I go to sleep with a smile on my face (Jxm)
We drinkin’ Henny, not Ace
Bartender bring me a whole ‘nother case, uh
Roll up a wood, we smokin' good, ayy, yuh, gelato (gelato)
Soon as I hop out the Bent', I'ma run up a check
An' these bitches gon' follow (they gon' follow)
Pop the rockstar pill damn, it made me go harder (it made me go harder)
Real VVS's gotta be flawless, uh, clearer than water (Jxm)

[Chorus: Trill Sammy]
Yeah, feel better (ayy)
Drinkin' Henny out the bottle (woo, ayy, yah)
I just fucked your bitch, it made me feel better (ayy)
Woke up right next to a model (damn, woo, ooh)
I just left the bank, it made me feel better (yeah)
Hi-Tech red, my cup dirty (mud, yeah)
Popped two 'Xans ('Xans), got me slurry (got me slurry)
Wake up and get that cash, I'm up early (I'm up early)
When I put this ice on, it made me feel better (ayy)
