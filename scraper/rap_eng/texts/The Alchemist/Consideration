My 1st Chemistry Set
Blocks, Chemist
Cook up
Yeah
Finished with this last hundred thou' through the money counter
Movin' the bag and I'm runnin' out in record timin'
Geneva band bright, with excessive diamonds
All you can move is puppy chow and New England clam chowder
You mismatchin' designers, I'm ? and the powder
And V12's and problems, and I ain't have a license
As I multiply and divide addin' money
I never paid attention in class except for math and science
Live in the lap of lux, smokin' on Cali's finest
These niggas so puss you'd have thought that they had vaginas
That's why we clap 'em up, ten packs, bloodclot 'em
I got ninety nine problems and a brick ain't one
I got thirty five shots, yeah the clip that dumb
And my handgun it look retarded as a chopper
We built this from the ground up, started from the bottom
It's Concreatures, game time, money ain't a problem

Pocket full of stacks
I had to take into consideration
That when you gettin' money, ain't no limitation
To what niggas'll do to get they hands on this paper (better tell 'em)
Have my critters come and lay down that demonstration
187
Cause niggas hate it when you get they bitches naked (bold)
And your chain made out of a bunch of tennis bracelets (cold)
And your closet full of fresh, put one in the sky (do it)
We're talking nothing but the best that money can buy

I got real expensive taste and I live an extravagant lifestyle
My left pocket: six G's, the other one: ten bands
And my watch on Swizz Beatz: I'm the one man band man
Four in my right palm, two in my left hand
In the back of the club doin' the band dance
All around the board, I was born in the USA
Guess you could say this an American Band Stand
Three hundred eighties got my man jammed
Now it's meet me at the Little Caesars my baby
I got them pan pans
Half assed think you slick, with a bag full of tricks
While you try'na penny pinch, I'm try'na cram jam
Twenty two grand in my True Religion brand pants
I sold a hundred grams, that's another ten bands
Put a one on it, that's an extra ten grams
I cook so much dope, I need two wristbands
And I ball so hard, I need a headband
It's Concreatures till I'm dead or in the fed pen
