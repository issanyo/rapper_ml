From the beak to the pebble to the water
In the street where the devil seems to wander

I do this for the amputated children
Lives settled by a manufactured building

I honestly can't stand what we're dealing/
Eyes on the grounds and i put my hands to the ceiling/

Almost all of the time i write all of my rhyme
I feel the rush and the riseand it touches my mind
As i blow kush to the sky and i say fuck the refine
I got a buck in my hand and it stay clutch by my side


Before the wikipedia mania
The media taking ya feet from the area

Leave ya peeps in hysteria
The fever scaring ya
Like measles and malaria

Rarely playing ya/ insane what i'm making ya/
In a phase where im taking a blade straight to the trachea/
Straight up i really kinda wish this was all made up/
Maybe it would be when i finally decide to wake up
