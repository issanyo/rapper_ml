Winsome portrayal sparked some intrigue and had it not
I would have pushed it toward your whole lot via blitzkrieg
The reticence is alarming thanks to armchair therapy
The fear and feeling of misunderstanding really sickens me
Tenant at the art house. Behind in my payments
The first of the month is approaching and every day since
I add another notch up on my wall
The tally marks evolved into a renascence type painting which I would at marvel at intently
Cannot decide if I should present these
Acute minds claim genius while I say it's elementary
There is treachery involved but you cannot trek without
The notion that everybody has 2 sides but they don’t show it
Throw me roses like i'm Morrissey
I stage dive to the floor to sleep
The more I hear and more I see appears to have turned touristy
The torment isn't forcibly inflicted, but it’s sure to be
In time if you hang on to that burden like it was normal
See I dug this one girl who was super into science
While I was more into defiance and the rebel alliance
Maybe that is why she fed our correspondence cyanide
While I was left wide-eyed still waiting for her
Outer space is preferred while I'm determined to reach
At least one thing to be proud of out of thousands of schemes
For times sake I hope I'm shouting loud of enough to be seen
Coz when you're only wavelengths you don't exist, capiche?
