[Verse 1]
I was like twelve when I took that inhale
I didn't know how to feel I was just digging your smell
I don't know what you did but fuck it, you did it well
Cause like ten years fell and I'm still under your spell
I even share you with my friends
Yeah its weird but you're an oppurtunist
Baby girl, me an you, we're a fucking unit
You're my boo so when I pass you excuse the rudeness
I know you're coming back, thats how we usually do it
I know you've been around forever but fuck it, I still love you
I'mma stand up for you when I'm square
Niggas judging you, you be here. Why I need you?
Cause you understand the hustle
All I ever want to see, I let nothing stand above you
How can I repay you for feeling so priceless?
Damn, you got me feeling like this
I'm going to spend it all on you, fuck the prices
And never ever leave you for that white bitch

[Hook x4]
Its just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch
Just me and my bitch

[Verse 2]
Baby we have a bond that is not to be broken
And even though our relationship status is so open
Girl without you I'm alone, when I got you I can focus
That's why each and every day, every hour I'm smoking
Lifting from my misery and drifting in my memories
They told me I should leave you but I knew that we were meant to be
I see you in my tendencies, THC the chemistry
I've been around the world and there is where you've been for me
If I could marry, it would be my honor
Forever me and you, Doms and marijuana
My loyalty for you has never been a problem
Cause you were even down when I hid you from my mama
You mean everything to me, if you leave I'll be the saddest
Even if the feds say that you illegal, I'mma have it
I'm gonna let your love burn, cause I need it, I'm an addict
I might just even get you tatted

[Hook x4]
