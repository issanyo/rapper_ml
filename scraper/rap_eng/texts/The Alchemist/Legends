[Hook 2X]
Gangsters don't die, we just turn to legends
All we go through is hell, what the fuck is a heaven
We live fast and stall death long as possible
Get our cash in, put threats in the hospital

[Verse 1]
Young P, When I was 13 I had dreams
To do what LL did and Run DMC
Dirty little fuck, learnin how to aim my P
Older niggas in the hood used to try to dub me
Til pops gave me a knife, told me handle my things
And if not, when I came back, he would handle me
I put my first little bit of fair niggas, I was gassed
Started hangin with the others that was on the same shit
Had my first taste of gunfire early in my years
Gang fights, we was jumpin niggas we was just kids
Takin coats off of victims, watches off of peoples wrists
Shootin in the air, party, turnin aimin for ya head
And that's young bloods and lue, youngs guns from back then
Grew up to be raps most infamous click
Most thugs we grew up wit, proud that we did it
And naturally, we got others that wanna see us hit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Capital P, when I was 13 I had dreams
Now I'm all grown up and livin out my dreams
And my pops ain't here now that nigga deceased
And that bein said, how you gonna son me
Niggas body J&J right there in Queens
Goes to show, there's no respect for the O.G.'s
Niggas talkin real tough like I'm N-E-X-T
Like I give a fuck about shootin up ya peeps
Bout gettin hit, bout to show you niggas how to bleed
Got guns in different states, you can't catch me sleep
Put bullets in ya heart, bullets all up in the meat
That's right behind the forehead bone you pled Z's
When it's on and poppin, you be beggin I stop it
You be beggin for your life, 'fore that head shot stop it
Rappers lovin my spit, fans lovin my shit
And then you got those, that wanna see me hit

[Hook]
