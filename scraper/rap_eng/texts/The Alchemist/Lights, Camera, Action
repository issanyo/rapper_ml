[Intro]
Wake yo’ ass up, nigga

[Hook]
Lights, camera, action (YOU’RE ON!)
Come on, floss for ‘em, daddy (Y-Y-YOU’RE ON!)
Come on, ice, platinum (Y-Y-YOU’RE ON!)
Single drop, I won’t flop (Y-Y-YOU’RE GONE!)

[Refrain]
Where M.O.P. at? Come on
Where M.O.P. at? Come on
Fuck that, keep it gutter
Where M.O.P. at? Come on
Where M.O.P. at? Come on
We right here, still breezy, still rugged, we ain’t leavin’
Holla “HOLLA!” when you see me

[Lil’ Fame]
I’m here to address all speculations
Now y’all muthafuckas got the game fucked up
I ain’t asking for no explanations
Now y’all muthafuckas got the game fucked up, go
It’s the legendary MO-P’s, unleashed killa
Tell whoever don’t like it, go suck them uddas
I live a hard knock, hard block life, duke, what up
God come first and my gun come second
And, and that bitch is right here with me
Don’t make me curse your ass out on my record like 50
(We’ll stomp the shit out ya) Nigga, my whole team’s with me
Big dreams with me, marksmen with me
Fuck the bullshit you yappin’ about
I’ll fuck around and put a hole in your head about as big as your mouth
So you might wanna think twice about your kid and your spouse
Take your punk ass back in the house (The gig is up)

[Hook]
Lights, camera, action (YOU’RE ON!)
Come on, floss for ‘em, daddy (Y-Y-YOU’RE ON!)
Come on, ice, platinum (Y-Y-YOU’RE ON!)
Single drop, I won’t flop (Y-Y-YOU’RE GONE!)

[Refrain]
Where M.O.P. at? Come on
Where M.O.P. at? Come on
Fuck that, keep it gutter
Where M.O.P. at? Come on
Where M.O.P. at? Come on
We right here, still breezy, still rugged, we ain’t leavin’
Holla “HOLLA!” when you see me
