Ayo this a DJ Stevie Steve exclusive

[Hook: Your Old Droog]
She's a hip-hop head
She's a hip-hop head
Hip-hop head
She's a hip-hop head
Hip-hop head
She's a hip-hop head
Hip-hop head
She gives hip-hop head

[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
I met her up at Santos, wearing that groupie uniform
The place packed, A$AP was scheduled to perform
Ya boy A-Trak and Plain Pat were spinnin' on the wheels
But I had to take my time before I went in for the kill
Club was smokey, low-key I played the bar
Still tuned in to my scuzzbucket radar
Find a young freak, who loves and hip-hop
And is just as passionate about giving whipwop
We fake-dance, ya man was spinnin' all the jams
A good DJ is one thats gets y'all to the yams
Cause you know that rap and hoes got a strong bond
Nearly lost her mind when they threw her song on
Midway through the sesh she long gone
Intoxicated, she still couldn't slob the dong wrong
Shit could never be whack with said broad
You could tell her top fire just from how her head nod

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Ayo I met her at a rap show, unfortunately underground
There was no girls, she was the only one around
Got so tight when they threw that Drake on
So all night we built on how we loved Raekwon
Ghostface, Premier, references had me stupefied
Like you 25, how the fuck you know 'bout Do or Die
Ayayay! On Tumblr postin' flicks of MF DOOM
Like my west coast bitch with Pac posters in her room
I went in her room and ate, then I ruminate, wait
Genuine concern if she got the burn, yearn
Either way I pulled up a seat, started to learn
'Til the night took a dark turn
When her makeup diminished
Lookin' older by the minute
But I still with it, shitted, son I hit it
From the back first
Then she got on top (and did what?)
And started spittin' Inspectah Deck's Triumph verse
She's a hip-hop head

[Bridge: Your Old Droog]
Shorties who are fans of J. Dilla, yeah they take the dillz
If she mess with Tip then she'll let you stick the tip
If she like Twista, you can twist her
On that Kweli shit, you can prolly hit
Fuck with Bun B, then she givin' up the buns, B
Shorties who are fans of J. Dilla, yeah they take the dillz
If she mess with Tip then she'll let you stick the tip
If she like Twista, you can twist her
On that Kweli shit, you can prolly hit
Fuck with Bun B, then she givin' up the buns, B

[Outro: Your Old Droog]
She's a hip-hop head
She's a hip-hop head
Hip-hop head
She's a hip-hop head
