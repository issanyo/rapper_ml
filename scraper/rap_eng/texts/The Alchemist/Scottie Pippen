[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Showin' no signs of letting up
Still kick you in the head like I think
You on the verge of gettin' up
No mercy, Cobra Kai, Cobra Commander
Deadly venom-spittin', niggas just a salamander
I'm livin' the life worthy of capturing on camera, documented
How one of the last lives ones did it
How I rolled up in the drop, how I rolled up that sticky
How I rolled with the women, elegant player, no simpin'
How I fucked them to sleep
How I rolled up out the building when I was finished
Keep it G
Them niggas not original, they motherfuckin' House of Mirrors
Not quite the image
I'm on that Popeye spinach, Mama mai-tai sippin'
She loves a square nigga
But now she tryin' somethin' different
Windy City Bulls Mitchell & Ness wool jackets
Some sweats and Scottie Pippens
My description, high off that fuzzy green prescription
Lyin' if I sayin' that I isn't
If you lookin' for that nigga: I is him
All eyes in this direction, a burden and a blessing

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Reporting live from the devil's palace
Breakfast, had two titties, two blunts and a turkey bacon sandwich
Two seasoned eggs and grape jelly
My hoes stay ready pop that pussy
Then pulled off in my Pontiac on Pirellis, '82 edition
Spotless Bonnie squattin' on sixes
Rather be countin' stacks than stuck in the county
Washin' the dishes or washin' drawers in the pen
Got two zones of soft and some Hen'
I had go pay the correct correctional officer to walk 'em in
Bail money on deck come at my neck
Bless that boy cause that same place him test is where he slept
I issue eternal rest, sign up and be a subscriber
The price of life got so high that I must make sure I stay higher
Stay with the purp out of pizo stay smackin' these geekers needles
Stay runnin' the rock just like I play quarterback for the Eagles
Randall, Donovan, to Michael
'Fore I picked up this mic I was hittin' licks with some Lords
And did dirt with plenty disciples
I'm gang-bangin' affiliated, federal investigated
Self-educated all my co-conspirators catchin' cases
I dropped straight outta college and I majored in home invasion
Believe I got the balls to clear up all of my altercations
Leave faces with alterations, the closed casket console
Tryna make a million dollars, fuck a million downloads
But if that equal the same, snatch it up and give me my change
I made a lane up in this game so niggas goinâ€™ remember the name
Gangsta Gibbs ho, two bitches cooking in the crib ho
Still push a bucket, but I ride it like a Benz ho
Tryna find a bridge ho, to slangin' raps, from slangin' weight
Said the Fred the new age Brad, bitch just call me baby face
