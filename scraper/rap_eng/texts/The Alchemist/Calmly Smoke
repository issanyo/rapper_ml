[Verse 1: The Alchemist]
I wanna smoke 'til my brain is numb
'Til I can't feel nothing and the pain is done
Take the good with the bad, that's how the game is won
'Cause the sun only comes out when the rain is done
And when I exhale the smoke I let the problems float
When I blow out a cloud I let the drama go
All the bullshit, the issues, all the gossip goes
All the rumors, all the whispers, all the talk just goes
All this money in my pocket and I still feel broke
I let go of all the nonsense and I calmly smoke
There's nothing that can make me angry
So take it up with God, that's the way that he made me
Or take it up with pops, that's the way that he raised me
Or blame it on the game for the way that it paid me
Then blame it on the money for the way that it changed me
And blame it on my lifestyle and say that I'm crazy
And blame it on the {*hitting herb sound*} trying to say that I'm lazy
There's nothing that you can say that's makin' or breakin' me
And when I blow the smoke out it takes all the problems away from me
Let go of all the nonsense and I calmly smoke

[Verse 2: Evidence]
I want to smoke so my eyes can bleed
So they don't see my pain, they just think its weed
Use the trees so they don't see my game, they just think I'm green
Inhale deep, my problems shrink away
God forgive my sins, tomorrow's a new day
It's like the smoke is novacaine easin' my brain
From the world going on outside, I stay sane
(Way out) I don't smoke to forget
Before I hit this, hold my head, God bless the dead
And I don't hold regrets
After I hit this, I don't listen, fuck what you said!
You know greed was never part of my weed plan
It's fire, blame the lah for murder he wrote
I let go of all the nonsense and calmly smoke

[Verse 3: Styles P]
I take long tokes, c'mon folks
Ain't nothin' in the world like strong smoke
We only blowing green shit, at least we ain't on coke
You would know what I mean if you was born broke
Raised in the ghetto where there's nothing but torn folks
What, torn house, torn heart, torn clothes
I just blew four, got another four rolled
Will I die today? Shit, only Lord knows
So I exhale, inhale again, did it for my little man
'Cause he's in jail again, need bail again
Gotta get rid of this shitty feeling
Alchemist, get your nigga higher than a New York City building
(Roll another one, and another one)
Sour diesel haze, kush mixed with the bubble gum, call it troublesome
'Cause the only thing that calm the Ghost
Is a deep beat, zone out and calmly smoke
