YO!
YO!
This is the Formula of the Ranger Shoalin'!
NnnNah-nah-Nah (Nah-nah-Nah)   (3x)
Nod ya head
Yes yes yes yes y'all!


Hiking in the mountains
With my Camelback
Ranger hitting low kicks in sunset
Could be my aura or the silhouette
You can END this call
But I ain’t finished it
Find a Layer of yourself
In the vision quest

You see my ego
Or my visions yet?
I’m all ears like
Da audio check

What’s influence
If you dont use it?
Spit that real
Then we can start a movement
Shift that mindset
For the Amusement
And Up and down we go
Rhetorician...
Booming out your stereo

Black and yellow like
Here we go
Bus 36’in
Runnin around you
Like Merry go

32 magic shit
Bars clipping fairies doee
Dusting the bleachers
Star seeking
Like Jerry Jones

Duece Duece
Emmit smith
Setting records doe
93, 94ooo

Ain’t crippin
Like I’m on death row
Spittin real
So all my ppls
Feel me tho

Yo momma like me in that video
She said..
I used to feed that Nigga cereal


Reeese my piece
Sheesh louise..
Sheesh Louish
Hey...

Got the Cool Asian... like General T'sos
Starting movements
Everywhere we go
Knowledge leakin' from your stereo
Fear is
Trying to figure out
How to scare me tho!

Bars goin through the Heat Check
Rhetorician cool ranch
Sprinkler system
Making yo feet wet
Baby...
You got sit on the floor..
You making my seats wet
Keep it comin’
Consistency
Reminding them of Keith sweat

This that.. Soul flow
Emotions up and down
Like yo yos

Wide eyed..
Like you seein this on the go pro..
Action shot..
34 I’m like Bo knows

Whoaa...
Sliding into second base..
Erasing time on my elbows
The Flow so cold..
This the day that hell froze

Thermometer drippin mercury
3rd planet from the sun

This knowledge is the diversity
I should partied less
At the university

The Comm courses still got to me
Lucy opened..
A part of me
I thought 'create your own cool.'
And now it’s the art of me
Gospel of Hip-Hop
Pumping through my arteries
Da Steelers starter... sweet burgh Departer

Undercover. Like matt Damon
Haunt you like wes craven
Baby face!
They won’t let me in the bar with my beard shaven

Rhetorician dope..
Dey calling this the Verbal Haven
Knoweledge got pencils shaven

You the low 5 like the South Haven
Too slow

Pin point the knowledge like longitude and latitude
Is wealth a figment of my attitude?
Cube raging come back...
I'm just that Nigga with that attitude!
