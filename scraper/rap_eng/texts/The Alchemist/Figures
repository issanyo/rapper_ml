[Verse 1: Cash Nelly]
I hit my nigga Fat Kitty For a package of the scubes
You gets 1 for the 3 I gets 4 for the 2
That's Mathematics love Lo fronted me a nug
I could make your mom's salary in a week selling drugs
But i'm smooth fam  I'd rather do this rap shit
If the money come short second option is that crack tip
I'm watching Belly slumped, blazing Dro in the palace
I let the money tell where i stay fuck an Atlas
I'm in my Yairon whip that's the Mercury
These hoes on that Trixie tip they keep lurking me
I'm cracking telephones and cracking cards it's a purgery
Headband from Switzerland, My jersey say Germany
Slicing competition like I'm licensed for surgery
Main reason why these pussy niggas wanna murder me
But i still run up in yo shit, like it was a burglary
I let my girl gargle me, these other hoes is trickery
DirtyMobb niggas on a come up, Art Boy Billionaires
Better get your funds up, fuck last place cause right now
We the runners up, Mini Hulk Hogan niggas swear they all tough bruh
