Human beings congregate
Difference within this race
Take control to rule the world
Slowly as our fate unfurls
Human beings segregate
Self destruction is our fate
Destroy each other for control
Naturally destructive souls
Hear the call of warring tribes
See eventual demise
Tear humanity apart
Die and heal our mothers heart
We live, we breathe, we hear we see
Humanity
We tear ourselves apart, total insanity
We live, we breathe, we hear we see
Humanity
We tear ourselves apart, total insanity
The warring tribes, and our demise
A tragedy
Is there a purpose to life?
Have we reached, our evolutionary peak?
Can we create a world that we will seek to find?
Evolution within our minds eye
From devolution we die
