[Intro]
Uh yeah, we up
Machine gun music
They saying, "Body, where the fuck you been at?"
I been busy, planning your funeral
Yours truly, God's favorite

[Verse 1]
All my wrongs got me living so right
Lost so much but never been a loser
I'm who I always wanted to be when I grew up
Sometimes I gotta stand back, look in the mirror
And I stand back and look in amazement
My God, what the fuck I done did

[Refrain]
Uh, Homicide!

[Verse 2]
4:80 in the morning
I'm with your bitch on the strip
They like "Body, what the fuck is you doing?"
I'm trying to start a family
You never spent six months straight in a staircase
Uh, I forgot what I looked like
Just make sure they play my documentary on Telemundo

[Refrain]
Homicide!

[Outro]
Yeah, Big motherfucking you know who!
