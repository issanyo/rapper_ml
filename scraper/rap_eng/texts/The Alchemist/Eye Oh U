[Verse 1: VerseBorn]

High as Pluto vibing out to Blue notes-
Still flipping ILL shit - diarrhea judo
I could lean a sumo with this heavy hitting rhythm
Off with his head If the bread is missing

You couldn't phase em wit the best inventions
Even in ya wildest dreams I'm in the best condition
Correct decisions inspecting a spectacled vision
Of was once unsteady now ahead of my missions

Getting it in remy and henny and trees to boot
Tell the truth if you sick- then he's the flu
The reason dudes hand cuffin chick-a-boos
When we step up in the club guess what-  got a reason to

I be breezin thru wit my eastern euro-
Bombshell no alarm bells keep it thorough
In and out on the double double but hold the onion
Animal style on stage get paid while the motors running

[Hook: VerseBorn]

Never known for bluffing
Throw a bow I'll unload ya stuffing
Catch a fade like  I owe u something
Respect the name nigga

Never known for bluffing
Throw a bow I'll unload ya stuffing
Catch a fade like  I owe u something
Respect the name nigga

[Verse 2: Dre Dub]

Respect the name cuz the name is Dre (Respect the name)
Stay in ya lane I get close mufukas start doin they thang
I got to hit up the homie get that QP
Roll up a box of 60- Swisher Sweets

Ima bout to cop it like it ain't nothing
Put it in my trunk man im stuffing
And get to rolling Dre get to going
With the blueberry and its scary when they hoeing

And they know just how we doin it man we gon kill em
DyVerse Productions what it does than hurry up and does this
I got the spider chillin wit me on scene man we all getting gritty
So heavy got them swish bangs and im ready (he ready tho)

Get on the track its just like that
A slow beat but I usually go fast

[Hook: VerseBorn]

Never known for bluffing
Throw a bow I'll unload ya stuffing
Catch a fade like  I owe u something
Respect the name nigga

Never known for bluffing
Throw a bow I'll unload ya stuffing

[Verse 3: K-Rekk]

This weed will get you disabled i think im on the payroll
Which means if you around me you gon stay mellow hello

Too many snitches too many fairytales

Bounce back like i never left the stuff K-Rekk San Mateo
