Contumacious little boy who second guessed perception
For the finite worlds alluring when overrun with deception
All I see are these egregious sights of fabricated pleasures
As a realist I can't help it for I'm treated like a leper
My apologies' perplexing with my lexicon in question
Explanations tend to mess it up instead of easing tension
Lesson learned for when the next one ever comes into my head space
You're special. I wonder if you're real in three dimensions
It's a feeding frenzy for those starving for a hint of meaning
In this sphere that takes a rocket ship to break on through it's ceiling
Kneeling down before an anthem sung by millions of people
From one nation, under guise that every citizen is equal

I am so afraid to put my trust in a promise
Every promise ever made it must be backed by trust
Colors will get shown like rainbows when someone up and
Goes back on their word to further show that I won't trust them

Remember me with fondness even if I leave the seat up
Problematic? My response will be an onomatopoeia
Time could be a little kinder but I find that in the briefing
If it waits for no man, don't expect me to wait either
The days that fall behind me are too numbered for my liking
Uninvited as they come the rates of them continue spiking
It goes 'go to bed', 'wake up low', 'tell myself to take it slow'
Then make up an excuse to why I did not break the ratio
Of more than common daily woes that act like they're convenient
Here's a shout out to those not afraid to die but do not mean it
