[Verse 1]
Yeah
It's Bam Bam
You know I'm back
It's me, it's me
Flushing
I sell coke, walk with a cane
Flex the green Porsche in the rain
Catch me at the mall with your dame
But nah, I ain't buying shit, she's tricking
Five pairs of all-white Airs and some Scottie Pippens
Bitches be basic and they ain't shit
At least I'm famous and I ain't shit
Well, my mother loves me, I'm her baby
We still drive each other crazy
Now my man needs a liver, bought it off of eBay
We started snorting Pepsi, now we got a fiend's face
I prey game before the pregame
I let my chicken go, give her free range
This is Jericho not Jerry curl
Put the pedal to the medal, make the Chevy twerve
Peace to my man Sean Astin
I put a 100K on Army versus Ball State
You know I does it
It's me
