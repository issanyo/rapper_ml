[Verse 1: Third Eye]
Ima fiend so if I need some weed I hit up Kush
Roll a B. Is that blue dream? oh shit my g Good looks !
Throw them seeds out, if I see that shit then bro I'm good
Dopamine, I need my fix a little kosher kush
A Brittle Blunt the type of shit that me smoke them woods
Middle man don't need yo ass just get that understood
And if I bus' on every bust down living in my hood
Then they won't trust my ass I probably wouldn't get no looks
Couple birdies on the perch
Plus a birdie on the porch
Bet we smoking after work
Only certain 'bout the verse
I love my woman cause she's puts in hella work
I love my girl and how she grounds me with this earth
And if you thirsty step in line hoe cause she's first
Sometimes my girl can get can Aggressive but she twerks
And Every time she to try to skirt
Get Triple doubles "at the court"
Kunta Kinte fought the worst
I been priveleged since my birth
Know I'm skill is hella light
I don't fit it in the burbs
Young bastard from the city
Went astral with the physics
Now cats won't get offended
From the fact the I been sinnin'
Am i Muslim Buddhist Christian
Fuck descriptions I'm just different
I believe that we all gods , gotta live , Don't got no probs
Call me Chris don't call me odd
Ever since I Been the bomb
I'm just tryna do my job
Look within and never stop
I'm not tryna sin, I'm just tryna do my job
I'm not tryna sin, I'm just tryna do my job
My sister thinks I'm just kid , that bitch could fucking rot
But I don't harbor hate , I told her to her dumb ass face
I clocked in every day
I had a change of taste
Weeks passed in school
"I'm bored that's lame"
A Wheat snack or two
Im sure I'd be straight
She's not a doctor but she gives it to me straight
I'm not a talker but I have lots to say
I message brethren saying
What we on today
WEED, ACID, SHROOMS
What more to say?
And with the blood moon up above
Here comes my fate...
Me, madlib, doom
So keep yo ass In tune
When my solar plexus straight perplexes all these foools
She does her drugs the way I eat my food
That's with a spoon
A Bowl of milk and sugar, With some toons
Beside the tube
I like to sit too close ,I just enjoy the views
She love to kiss the way I like to fuck
Dats in the nude
What's happening in the news?
A Missing cat or two ?
Another trump cartoon
I'm not a dumb bafoon
I light the doobie , if you do flinch then you not immune
I keep it Lucid , just like Luda I'ma act a fool
I making music , that confuse you , make you shoot up school
​
[Verse 2: Charles Moonshine]
Now I done took a lot of things
Some shit I’ll never accept
I'm pretty horny just to go but won’t get sexual death
You don’t think you can leave the coke
Just need some pep in ya step. (Fuck yo insecurities)
Better feel like your the best of the best
I live inside my head
That’s why Im always acceptin' neglect
You make it up to me by cleaning up my mess off ya breast
Was cornered with love,  in the end was only left with respect
But on her wedding day she’ll pull-up to my address in a dress
(So now you know)
Winter ain’t the only reason why my toes be cold as ice
Crazy bitches is the only bitches that I know in life..
I threw my shot
She returned the flavor with a throwing knife
My lack of confidence is the only reason I’m alone at night...
They wanna go to a house party but
I'ma stay home tonight
Fire up sip some Dick Gregory & watch some dolemite
I can lose my mind so I make sure my head is sowed on right
Recognize that I’m still real & all these niggas just prototypes
(hold on tight)
You ain’t hard workin cause you makin music
The shit u make is not that great somebody in the first grade could do it
Music's is truly an occupation
Nobody makes it case they feel it 
Now being a prostitute is being put into the brains of children
That’s the sickness in disguise, I’m a witness no surprise
Strappin up for war before I’m ever snitching on the guys
(Hi I’m Chucky)
And I’m always mentioning my bride
When I bite her I can see the animal characteristics in her eyes
Damn, but now u different, why u actin funny
Told her to eat a dick she ain’t herself when she hungry
I was the right one so confused on why u left
Don’t let her fool you dog Im the realest she ever met
Ha! and Ill rob you for them golden chains with a spear possessed by the spirits of Goldberg & Roman Reigns
Then I’ll forget the world once I’m in my low-low
GVO pack peace signs & wolverines the logo
Yeah...
