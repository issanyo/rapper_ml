I’ve got Jesus

Some say life is…just one big crisis

[Richard Pryor]
What? Don’t start no shit now…
And dudes…(You crazy!)…Huh?...(You crazy!) Yeah

I’ve got Jesus

You are never left alone (The Lord is our savior)
Remember, you are never left alone

I don’t know a whole lot but I know that’s the truth
