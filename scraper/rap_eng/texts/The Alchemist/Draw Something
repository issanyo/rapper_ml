[Intro]
"Picasso once said there are no child prodigies in painting
There may be in music, but not in painting"
"How old were you when you started painting?"
"I was 13 when I started
I got inspired to start painting when I drew my first piece
And saw that God had given me a talent
So, umm I knew when God gives you a talent, you should use it"


[Verse 1: Alchemist]
Uh, no boundaries at all
I sketch, take ten steps, allow me to draw
My paintbrush dance on the canvas without a flaw
Big wolf live in a village made out of straw
I'm a known arson, fire marksmen
Flaming target
Disappear in the dark, I'm fly like Aladdin's carpet
God willing, I'ma kill 'em
Smoke drifting out the chillum
Guts spilling, medical requests I'ma fill 'em
It's the man you aren't
Bang on pots and pans til the jam gets started
The paper's riddled with little pellets, the past ??
Overflows over the limit, they can't guard it
I step off the cliff and blast off into orbit (I'm outta here)
And spark like a torch, the money fallin' out the orifice
No curriculum, that's par for the courses
Startin' the horses
Hand on the table right where the fork is

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Yo, we go off when we go on to get started
Funny how I'm typing just a little bit further
Or is it farther, I never could decipher
Consider me an author, who wrote it at his highest
Games change, lanes change, same gang approaches
Watch the floor hit the lights out, avoid the roaches
Wipe the whole slate clean, that's what I hear the most
The coast is clear from the clearest coast
A dreamer does well under the rays of the sun
In the city that we dwell, it's like a ray from a gun
It's like a beam from an ??, it's like an after effect
So if they pull a strap it's like a Jack in a deck
Out the box, out the crews it flocks
Emcees are jumpin' out shoes, let 'em keep the socks
I got heart, and I exercise
There's no telling when I'll ever settle
So set a time

[Verse 3: Oh No]
I keep a gallery of art, a store's full of the crates
I gotta art of masterpiece, DiVinci's locked in the safe
I keep a place for the liquor on hold, take a shot of this
Shitty bottle while I could pose in an apocalypse
Mad cause I'm on my biz while they catchin' vapors
You're better off pulling the tree, tryna stretch paper
I draw threats like Marvel to the sketch paper
Risk-taker, suplex tracks and no neck breaker
Digital art, graduated from analogue
I got teachers framing my catalogue in the campus hall
Everything I draw is on some raw-raw, cat is raw
Like that is all, numbing your grill like it was Ambesol
Now, where the aerosal (shh), paint a picture
Then turn the cameras on and brush in another adventure
Fly overseas and make skrilla from these written scriptures
Rolling with the Step Brothers, draw somethin', niggas

[Outro]
"And as he continues to knock masterpieces like these out in just an hour
He'll soon be moving beyond this Northbrook art gallery
And on to bigger things
"It's finished"
"There's no education, no understanding of art history
Or of art movements, no intimidation
And here she is completely and utterly innocent
With an innocent eye, almost
Coming to a canvas"
"It's truly from inside"
"She's painting at a level that master's don't attain
For 30, 40, 50 years...and yet she's 10"
