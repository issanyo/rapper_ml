[Verse:]
He may not come when you want him to
The Christ
What’s happening
I come in the name of jesus by the power of [?]
Who name you coming in
And by who power
Is what?
It’s the spirit of God
See the spirit of God is omnipotent
And it works on you, it’ll works on your ass I can be far far away
Cause it’s considered constant
You know
Anybody, anybody who’s listening
Goddamn my ass kissing
No matter how you come with me
If you down with doing what i’m talking bout doing
The father lives in the wind
You down with that
You ain't down with that
Shut your Goddamn ass up
