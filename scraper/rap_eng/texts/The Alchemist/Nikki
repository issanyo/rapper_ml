My criminal style is wow
Well some of these base heads want shameless
Promotion to make me gain on this intro fuck production

Who cares its not that intense I been here
I settled earth & somebody covered it like a dance
Grandma says the new vs made further riots
32 clowns 25 stans 1mil attempts, suffocated underground just to bleed from the air
One metal chain
Mostly married to my heart is a cross
Twilight, Devils reject species Nikki take breath
Feature released in discretion prints paper straight from the mint/ what more can you ask for in a world of deceit and revenge?
I don’t know
Tell em to play this new dumb shit
Look at Kella glow

You took hella long

I was anonymous there
I put all of these tracks into your head I went to prison in there
I was a drummer in there
I’m in the bread lane
Lonely on the airplane
Never listen to what they said
No one was able to get it until then
Take me there Take me here
You tryna hold my hand
Always wanna strangle strangle the wrist
Blame me on this triangle triangle next
Upset and danger dangerous
