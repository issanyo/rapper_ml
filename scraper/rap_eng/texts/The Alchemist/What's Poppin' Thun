[Prodigy] What's poppin thun {*4X*}

[Hook: repeat "What's poppin thun" start of each line]
... nuttin but that brand new shit
... nuttin but that cash on the bed
... it's nuttin but that food, that bread
... nuttin but my gun on your head

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Smoke game Cambodian, doly in the Benz
Turnin up the sounds of 2006
This the future of rap, I'll give you a glimpse of this
So you can be ahead of the game, and impress your friends
Bumpy Johnson and Dutch Schultz, we blowin up hoods
This is theme music my nig, you wake up to it
Get dressed, throw on your gun and Jacob to it
Ladies throw on they pumps and makeup to it
You can grill all you want...
But when that light turn green, I'mma go from 0 to 60
In like 3.9, my thun told me shine baby shine
So I get it like I'm out of my mind
Man I did that already, I'm ahead of my time
I'm on some new shit now, if it ain't money I ain't budgin
Cause my hammer do the buckin {*blam*} over dumb shit
I gotta move right niggas want it with the kid
You can't touch me boy my roots is too thick
And run deep in the dirt, I'll give you the business
Well my crib say "Welcome" on the mat
So you can lay in the bushes, 'til your feet drenched
But you gon' have a hard time tryin to find which one I'm in
And which state I'm in, P the fuckin rocket man
Don't matter it's the hot shit, for that moment
P shit is timeless, he keep goin
