I feel like this is just a means to an end
Does it hold any meaning as I reach the end?
Lost to memory, final reality
When I'm awake or asleep both are all but a dream
Finality of this life is something certain for me
Lost to memory, final reality
Sifting fragments of time, drifting, falling away
Sense of finality, fate is dawning on me
What is the purpose of death, live, learn, die then forget?
Feel I'm lying awake, only sleep when I'm dead
Lost to memory, final reality
Compressed memories
I'm temporary, unable to contain
Like Epsilon, my finality is pointing out the way
What have I learned?
What will I forget?
Monumental rhythm of life is pounding out the beat of the dead
But might it all end, without a meaning?
Lost to memory, final reality
Speed Of Life
Each day grows quicker as I breathe
Or is it that every year seems to get shorter?
Racing at the speed of life
So much to do, so little time
I don't want to win this race
Heading swiftly to my grave
Epidermis showing signs of natural decay from living my life
No way to slow the hands of time
Of this I am sure you live, then you die
From infancy to my old age
Another day of life
Another turn of the page
Racing at the speed of life
So much to do, so little time
Heading swiftly to my grave
Is it only me, is it all in my head?
Rather a fight to ascend than an easy descent
Do you ever get the feeling you're in some sort of race?
Each day has more to offer, there's just no time to play
One mine I'm a child, the next I am a man
And fate, it pushes my life, the fastest speed it can
