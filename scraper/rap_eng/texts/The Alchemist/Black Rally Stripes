[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
I assume that you brought your lighters
Yeah
Lemme out right here

[Verse 1]
Shit like stove top stuffing
Stirring the mother fucking pot full of money
Alchemist left the oven on for me
Coke not bubbling
Crack is not coming
Up to the top
Forming what they're looking for
Niggas like zombies
Waiting on me to
Release another batch
That itch you got to scratch
I know what you like
And bitch I got a case of that
Wait
Split bumper Z28, great
Black rally stripes
Parked outside my homies motorbike
My office where we talking
My office where them sharks swim
My office where we laughed off your offers
They wasn't plausible
What was they doing for us
Remain focused through all the smoking
Acting like my ribs showing
I want more than my potion
Coming for your shit because you on some ho shit homie

[Hook]
Ride out, roll another one
We gonna stay outside till them fucking helicopters come
I learnt that from a Cali cousin
I got my first set of Dayton's from him
Now I'm skating on them
In New Orleans
Thinking about major money
Safe money, escape money
Big weight money
Diamond heist in broad day
Walk away from it
Huh

[Verse 2]
What made you think you could set foot
Up on the set and not get cooked
Met with a crooked look
Victim of a jux, bad bitches took
Full advantage of this bastard
Sent him home shook
Without his rolex
He was just trying to get some nook
Man
Bourbon Street secrets and scams
Shit get deeper
The more you know
You probably wish you didn't know
My lowrider clean as liquid detergent so
13's swerving on purpose
Got your bitch nervous but she learning
If its risky than its probably worth it
I worked for this position, I earned it
So now I don't even mention the permits

[Hook]
Ride out, roll another one
We gonna stay outside till them fucking helicopters come
I learnt that from a Cali cousin
I got my first set of Dayton's from him
Now I'm skating on them
In New Orleans
Thinking about major money
Safe money, escape money
Big weight money
Diamond heist in broad day
Walk away from it
Huh
