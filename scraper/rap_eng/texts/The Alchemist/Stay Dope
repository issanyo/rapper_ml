[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Numb off of thirty milligrams of something strong
Smoking on something feeling like I hit the fucking bong
I am the shit, what you thought was fucking wrong
Raise a hand at me, you gon' lose a fucking arm
He upset cause my music is fucking bomb
And my face make shortie turn fucking on
Stay calm and get some
Or you could get dumb, yeah go and get guns
And I'mma be right here for when you get back
And you gon' get a standing ovation, get clapped
Yeah, he deserve an encore
And why not? These niggas acting like they want more
See they want me to be the bad guy
Robin Hood green I'm Peter Pan fly
Stop pulling on my wings, I'm trying to get high
Just do your little thing, I'll be out here doing mine

[Hook]
Getting doper by the day, get the fuck up out the way
When you see a real nigga like me (stay fly)
While you stuck on that craze I be on another page
I'll be on another wave (motherfuckers, they blind)
But I'mma stay dope
Hey, I stay dope
Yeah, I stay dope

[Verse 2]
Ok PCP
A strap, 400 pills and fake ID
Yeah I'm hotter than hellfire, I embrace violence
Give me a hug, come and get your face wired in
I get money on the bar
Apostrophe S, super fresh, triple X
Think before you move on that nigga, he a mess
He'll move before he think on you niggas, EMS
Smoking that god bless, getting lifted
High technology, I'm real nifty
Keep a little box stashed in the Hybrid
She want a roll, I bring her ho-ass to my crib
She love a hood nigga getting money, she ain't fucking with no marks
And we could do it very well, 24 hours go hard

[Hook]
