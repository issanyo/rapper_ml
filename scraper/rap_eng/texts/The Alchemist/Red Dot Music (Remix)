Yo, got my whisky with honey?
My flow more bourbon than most of you urban cats
Riding the suburban with my red and black lumberjack
You feel it?

[Verse: Y-Kay]
I’m on the shit as if I was the greatest
I’m the latest, brand new with a team of terminators
You didn’t like me now you do; they all suffer from vapors
I’m going major with no major, still after the paper
I'm smokin purple like i really do root for the lakers
You see me balling hard but I'm really aiming for acres
I go hard for my joints but thanks I don’t need no favors
The only time you could see me will probably be later
Cause when I bust my 16s you know  it's prolly laser
I’m no savior; I'm captain faded just a darker Vader
Crushing information and I overdose on the data
My grandma looking down as I look up right at my maker
I been to hell and back so I don’t really hear the haters
I’m on a mission to make it, while she licking the favor
I can’t trust nobody around me not even my neighbor
My mind racing too fast for these fools i'm not on the radar

Flowing hot as wasabi
She calls me papi
Poppin pills in the lobby
Probably pissing the posse
And yeah I'm too bossy, bitch get off me
My dick too costly, i'm foul,  she's saucy
She saying, Y-Kay chill, why you cocky?
I ain't respond I'm fried, looking for my car keys
Ohh please
Got the instinct in my soul to go free
Feel the breeze, I'm in the lead
I cook it like it's crack, watch me pull my sleeves up
Hennessy in any season, thank god for  breathing
I need some more time, I been slacking beforehand
I tell her use that mouth before hands, it's important
I been crafting this soul plan, ever since you heard me say, fuck around with the flow fam
Sophisticated
I think rap genius can get me famous
Yo son, I been writing pages
Make a book about these dire ages
I'm dying ageless
Cause my shit live forever like the mayans' greatest
The administration is defying races
And all you had to do is define these races
And i'ma come first in all these races
Exclusive to green you can call me racist
Face it
You can’t comprehend my logic’s basics
Like I believe in god, and i'm tryna embrace it
Still understanding religion in this world of matrix
You all know what’s right, based on what is stated
Even socrates asked questions
I am in a dream like mission
They perceive me like i'm different
I'm on a drive just listen

On my mom i'm sicker
On my vibe i'm living
Don’t go hide just spit it
If you alive then get it
My fewer rhymes acidic
Got witnesses in the civic
I'm pushing out passing limits
Your missus is in her feelings
Even you can go feel it
Them couple bars in the cellar
Them couple rappers are iller
L.O.T we in the building
Potential stars, i'm a killer
With realer errors
Don't need a mirror
I am all flawed, except my margiela


[Hook: Y-Kay]
It must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
Cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth
Just for that sizzle, Gore-Tex in case of drizzle

It must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They looking down, keeping watch 'til I'm dead
So how'd I get this red dot on my head?


[Bridge: Mac Miller]
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
I said it must be the drugs, I said it must be the drugs
