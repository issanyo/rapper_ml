[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Since I was at Kingsborough
Pea coat, black coffee, doing these things thorough
Not far from our borough
I ain't smoking Marlboros
But sometimes I buy a loose in the ghetto
They got Mavericks, Dunhills, Benson and Hedges
American Spirits, Parliaments
But nah, instead I'mma cop the Winston Reds
Those who said there was a ceiling to my shit
Never knew I had stories
That's top of the building, top billing I'll perform these
Gated homes, gated kicks, closet filled with Mauris
And it's no longer stressful, do this with more ease
Save the tension for the juvies
I'mma prove these cowards wrong
Already did it, now we're on
And I've been popping stop before Pathmark turned to Stop & Shop
My mind vexed, these hoods changing is a trip
Remember Franklin Ave was nothing but crips fighting
Now Crest ain't the only ones with whitening strips
At a party you would feel like it could pop at any minute
Now they bump into you and say "sorry" like they meant it
Could tell their mothers really used to coddle
While YOD'll go to the spot with a open bar and still boost a bottle
Not even proud, it's just truth son
Uncouth, since a youth copped the hun' proof
You show your hub proof to prove that you ain't cheatin'
Sending screenshots
That's a clean shot
I'm getting bread in more than three ways with mean spots
Pull some cake out, you ain't gotta go to VA to see knots
Stay taking the N train to Canal Street
Years ago I would've killed to get an Al' beat
I just wrote to one for a year
Won't put it out 'til it's some shit we really want to hear

[Smoke break: Your Old Droog]
Yo hold up, hold up, hold up. Give me a second man, this smoking shit's really messing with my breath control. Uh-huh. Yo, matter of fact lemme go outside real quick, I'mma smoke this cigarette. It's my last one - I swear to god, and I'mma quit
Yo, word to me

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
I went from welfare to wealth errywhere
I'm that dude tattooed on a heifer's derriere
Had nothing to wear
Now your Droog dresses very sharp with the necessary flair
Hated having no money, used to grind my gears
And when I'd grind, my gear stayed bummy
Hear growls from my tummy
Folks would say nothing to me
If they did, it was something scummy
Usually out a fast car passing by
Middle fingers as the train'd pull away
Tell the truth, I'd take that - least of my problems on a painful day
But still, the sun rises in the east
And it's no surprises, I'm been a beast
My Dominican [?] finaliste
Got a brand new ride she finna lease
Just came off a tour in Greece, war and peace, uh
Now we back up in Hell's Kitchen
Talking to myself, twitchin', making these sales, pitchin'
Come to the spot
It's like Redman - MTV Cribs with the bell missin'
Chug copious amounts of ale, pissin'
Keep neighbors up at night 'cause of the television
Wonder what they hearin'
That's old C-SPAN 3 R. J. Reynolds tobacco hearings
Like I'm back up at Kingsborough
Pea coat, black coffee, doing these things thorough
Not far from our borough
I ain't smoking Marlboros
But sometimes I buy a loose in the ghetto
They got Mavericks, Dunhills, Benson and Hedges
American Spirits, Parliaments
But nah, instead I'mma cop the Winston Reds

[Verse 3: Your Old Droog]
I stay[?]
And my phone holds everyone, from Taye Diggs
To FKA Twigs
Backstage swigging hot green tea with a lemon twist
Old Droog is a feminist
All up in the McGraw-Hill building [?]
In a few years I'mma be where Em is
Shaking off the PTSD tremors
YOD and the 'Chemist, what's the premise
They still don't get the enigma yet
You herbs are the type to do Lucky Cigarettes
When I sell 'em only time I flip 'em
Reflect back on when we used to dip 'em (when we used to dip 'em)
How you think I got the twitch
Back in high school I used to bum bogues off a pregnant bitch
Fuck you thought?
I cop Too $hort and throw one out for Lil' Newport
Make a stack and put that bread away
You drop cheddar on your bae
With me all she get is Cheddar Bay
If she's lucky, that Chucky-Bride-in-the-face-ass
Might get some Kentucky Fried
Kennedy's or Crown
Stay away from these frenemies and clowns
Vultures and hounds
I'm not them, see I really hold my culture down
I once saw a DOOM mask in a ultrasound
Living by the same principles my OG tried to instill
I'm going in, still
Content is like Half A Mil's
What else I'm gon' rap about? Green grass and daffodils?
Sell your mother krills
Might call her over for some New York Undercover and chill
I'm like the light-skin Malik Yoba
Relapsing on my second week sober
Spit real phlegmy
Sipping Remy, leave the Ace of Spades to Lemmy
Motorboat hoes to motorhead
Say some shit, bitches be like "go to bed"
Nah, I sleep when I'm tired
A gentlemen during interviews - and a creep when I'm hired
Rarely get inspired
'Cause rap now is tired
Smoking Winstons, looking at ...
