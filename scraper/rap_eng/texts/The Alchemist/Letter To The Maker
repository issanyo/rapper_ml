(Hook)

I look at god he's staring right back
I ask him if I'm on the right track..
Cause all I wanna do is write raps..
And when he writes back... I kinda like that

So I'm doing shit an angel do
Doing shit an angel do

So I'm doing shit an angel do
Doing shit an angel do

(Verse One)

I keep my head up through everything.. i promise you it only makes me stronger/
Any obstacle in front of me it only takes me longer but i reach the destination/
Jun!or mother fucker repping Vegas LOUD MiLiTiA don’t forget the exclamation/

See i came up.. slanged bud spit a lotta flame but i didn’t get the play to be real its a shame cause
My bros here.. Sometimes I wonder if my bros hear, or if they play it once because they don’t care/

And as i look around i start to see a lot and notice more
So if your not down Ive got to toss you overboard/
My homies always bored.. same shit different year/
Im on my david blaine shit had to disappear/

Take a plane shit had to get up on my own two..
And i don’t owe you a minute of my time/
Im tryna get on stage you keep sitting in the line/
The old me was killed.. Did I commit the crime?
June

(Hook)

I look at god he's staring right back
I ask him if I'm on the right track..
Cause all I wanna do is write raps..
He doesn’t write back and I don’t really like that

So Im doing shit a demon do
Doing shit a demon do

I said Im doing shit a demon do
Doin shit a demon do

Im fed the fuck up with everything, hard to make it far when only peddling/
Sick to my stomach never settling/ means I’m shitting on the competition so steadily/
Also metaphorical i stay away from wedding rings/

I’m drinking henne heavily, don’t recall whats said to me/
Im trapped in my own mind its honestly a hell to me/
And as i look around i only see the things i want to/
I got a good girl around but i want two/ selfish right?

I’m up alone in the dead of night.. gotta get it right with these verses or I’m selling pies/
Gotta write with a purpose or I’m telling lies.. this is life is it worth it? I’m just getting by

And if i went to school I would get an A. I’m schooling dudes and getting paid/
Went from struggling, to hustling then i started getting laid/
Asked god for forgiveness didn’t have shit to say/
So I got no religion you can save it for a different day/

PRAY!
