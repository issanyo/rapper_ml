[Verse One: Bun B]
Say! I'm a trill ass nigga, wait let me define
I'm down for my issue with that bread on my mine
I'm built for that big boy shit like Depends
And outside of the fam, we ain't got no friends
I got a couple priors a couple pendin
We know you ain't a gangsta ho so stop pretendin
I checked your resume it don't compute
If ya bought this and sold that where's ya loot?
I know you don't wanna compare ya hustle game with me
Your cards two years old and your chain is three
Bitch you can't hang with me, and it's plain as day
Your niggas ain't got it in 'em then swing this way
Your reputation is built on bullshit
So the four fifth I pull quick and give you the full clip
I didn't want to but I had to do it
Since I did it for the hood I was glad to do it, nigga!!!!

With two big flippers and some gowns and some slippers
Hot metal like the weather more clips than the Clippers

[Verse Three: Lil' Boosie]
Look! Some say I talk alot of shit well I was raised wrong
Coke dealers who got tired of bein broke niggas
I'm walkin outside with the four five yeah!
I can't be scared drinkin purple to the head
Permit the scene yeah we leanin in that boot nigga
Heroin got niggas gone so we shoot quicker
They call us country cause we thuggin in a small county
City folk they ain't grateul for their good surroundings
I run that shit that make the real nigga stand up
It's Boosie Bad Azz trap like and what!!
Asylum signed me, now a nigga find me
On B.E.T. with W-E-E-D
I.E. Ninety eight, I'm an underground hard hitter
How you spit how you spit it? God nigga
Kay Slay I'm underrated and I promise you
I'm fittin to hit the rap game and this what I'm a do
Fuck I don't love like Rosa Parks hit the bus
Niggas in the south spittin but them niggas ain't us (THEY AIN'T US!!!)
We drank tusk, smoke purp with the DipSet
Grip teks, and hit niggas in they flippin neck
All I want is my respect, I ain't 'gon say nothin else
I'm a let the case rest Boosie Bad Azz!!!!!!!!
