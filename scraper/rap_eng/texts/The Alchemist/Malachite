[Chorus: D0mane]
Stoned off this Malachite, I can't never undermine
Put my heart, in this art
Trying to break the paradigm
My niggas all spark, and we all in our prime
My niggas all spark, and we all in our prime
X2

[Verse 1: D0mane]
Stoned off this Malachite, yeah i think I lost my Mind
You said what? Nigga colder than I?
That's a lie
Raise my hand and grab the mic right before testify
My, lyric intrinsic I ain't got, to justify
(Nigga)D to O, my range, clearly defined
Silk lines, catch a good vibe like Marky Mark
Pulled her strings like a harp, now its time to depart
Every that girl been with me, end up in the Psych ward
I get stoned, no Crystal therapy
A rock is just rock, no matter the rarity
Tryna' make  convo' so she Ask me whats my goals
Staring at her thighs, say the eyes is mirrors to soul
Then i Told her that I dig deep like zero in hole
Ask a caveman, how long a nigga been cold
Hit the kush 2 times, let my mind recombine
Fuck tying, I'm in my prime, I won't lie, life ain't got no overtime

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: D0mane]
This a whole new strain, what you feeling in ya brain
DMT, pumping through  ya system like bane
Could never the Life that they, tried to  ingrained
Tryna' pass me that blue pill, but I think i will abstain
See my niggas all spark, like what's in Optimus
And when I say we in our prime, I ain't being a optimist
Fuck a target audience, i Never miss
Stay on that bullseye, ares or Taurus rolling-out tight optics, look like Tokyo drift
Peak this, so high looking down on Everest
All my foes fulla' woe, cause they heard that do's back
Clutching onto that branch, like Yasir Arafat
Digital, Mind trip, more like a transplant
A scanner,darkly,feel like substance D
Look here:Another abductee, ended up emcee
See, Long as I breath, it's the green, you can keep the debris

[Chorus]
