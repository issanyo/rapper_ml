[Chorus]
I'm floating away without leaving the ground, ground
They asking me what's it like up there? I tell 'em I ain't coming down
I'm tryna stay up and I don't wanna touch down, down
They asking me what's it like up there? I tell 'em I ain't coming down
No no, I ain't coming down, no no, I ain't coming down
No no, I ain't coming down, I ain't coming down

[Verse 1]
Now that my vision's more clearer
This is for the hate on Royce in Detroit era
I know y'all had a good time but that was your time
But that was your error, now look at you and look at me
Compare us, you can do it easily
This ain't when Royce was looking stupid on that beef DVD? Uh-huh
Shout out my niggas D-Twizzy, I'll admit when I was wrong
I remember thinking and I should probably hit my nigga Von
You talking shit about me at your barbershop? You obviously politicing wrong
Niggas need to stop PMSing
I hope y'all barbers give your ass the same hairline as me and DMXâ€™s
I wait from wishing Trick-Trick was gone
For picking which bitch that wishing I could TwitPic my home
And as far my nigga Trick before we was brothers
I think we really just need to get to know each other, I'm off

[Chorus]
I'm floating away without leaving the ground, ground
They asking me what's it like up there? I tell 'em I ain't coming down
I'm tryna stay up and I don't wanna touch down, down
They asking me what's it like up there? I tell 'em I ain't coming down
No no, I ain't coming down, no no, I ain't coming down
No no, I ain't coming down, I ain't coming down

[Verse 2]
I gotta say this shit one time
When have you ever known me to get in the way of one's grind?
Cause even when that dark cloud hovered above me
I went from signed to unsigned, then I found my own sunshine
Now let me say this shit one more time
When have you ever known me to get in the way of your grind?
Can you find one hip hop listener around the globe
Who don't know that Nickel Nine is from Motown?
These cats say, "He's whack
He ain't even from the D so why he got that D tat?"
Then their friends run to me like my friends
"Saw you cyphering on BET but he ain't like it cause you ain't have no D hat"
Make up your mind you whining niggas
Ryan in business schools to talk, bought shoes for shawties
Bought coats for the kids while you niggas choose to floss
And y'all wanna nail who to the cross? Y'all niggas soft, I'm up

[Chorus]
I'm floating away without leaving the ground, ground
They asking me what's it like up there? I tell 'em I ain't coming down
I'm tryna stay up and I don't wanna touch down, down
They asking me what's it like up there? I tell 'em I ain't coming down
No no, I ain't coming down, no no, I ain't coming down
No no, I ain't coming down, I ain't coming down
