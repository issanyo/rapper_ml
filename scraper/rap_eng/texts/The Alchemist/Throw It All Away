[Chorus]
I got some money, I'mma blow it all today
They say 'Michael, don't throw it all away'
And my reply was 'There's more on the way'
When I said it, I was walking in the rain

[Verse 1]
I did a show in Chicago on the first
Now I'm back in LA like Chicago and First
No son but I fathered this verse
That's all I'm probably worth
And I'm from sunny CA to reign on all of this earth
Rainy terrain, receive the God sent messages
We know the answer, but dance around what the question is
(What is it?) It's back to who's on first
It's my dog
It's his tail
It's the chase
It's the search
It's the ignorance that causes all the bliss in my surroundings
Cause dealing with reality's like drawing out your boundaries
And I refuse to be referred as less than a creative
So catch me when I'm live in town as I've been demonstrating
That I could find my greatness in the waking of my absence
And absolutely kill it when they're dealing out these bad hands
A player plays what a player's dealt
And carries baggage like conveyor belts
And never fucking saves his wealth

[Chorus]
I got some money, I'mma blow it all today
They say 'Michael, don't throw it all away'
And my reply was 'There's more on the way'
When I said it, I was walking in the rain

[Verse 2]
I write to Alchemist 'cause others don't inspire me
I got my people and they got my back entirely
I kill with Iriscience on the side of me
By myself, I lay 'em out and iron out the irony (Flat)
What a long winding road it's been
With no sign of slowing up around its turns and bends
How many have friends that ain't foes within?
Dirty laundry in the wash, but them clothes don't spin
I mean, really, I kill two birds with one bullet
The target's when I line it up, the trigger's when I pull it
Out the gate, a bit late, but the champ is back
I need a third hand to wear my rings and hold plaques
I hit the track like the run is new
Hands high like a stick-up, Killer Michael running jewels
It's true, the eyes slanted, my fam rock the planet
Don't take fans for granted like the money is due

[Chorus]
Got some money, I'mma blow it all today
They say 'Michael, don't throw it all away'
And my reply was 'There's more on the way'
When I said it, I was walking in the rain
(What is it?)
Got some money, I'mma blow it all today
They say 'Michael, don't throw it all away'
And my reply was 'There's more on the way'
When I said it, I was walking in the rain
