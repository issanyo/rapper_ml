[Verse 1]

The lone ranger at the bodega, attack you with a cloak and dagger
Prey on your prayers, while you in the closet like a coat hanger
I’m serving these haters but I am no waiter
You say I’m mad in the head I’m supplying the anger
And I talk about death, because we are no strangers
I got a contract with the devil signed wit blood on the paper
Turned into ashes popping off candy rappers now and later
Have u breathing heavier then an asthmatic Darth Vada
Born in the boom bap
In the darkside there’s no chance of turning back
That’s like saying I don’t spit crack or there’s no cursing in rap
I’ll use your body for target practice, all army tactics
Then dismember your crew and stick em all in my mattress
Now who u who sleeping on
I got freak bitches like Nia Long showing thong
Who suck me off while the TV on
I stay guarded by castle walls since the days of Babylon
You act out your wealth stunting, I'll smack your mouth like Paquao for nothing
From the park bench, to becoming a myth like Lochness
I stay rooted in darkness with the tools of a locksmith
On my conquest, to the top of the rosters
U imposters act friendly but really envy my saga. The lone ranger. (He's back)

[Hook x2]
The lone ranger's back in town, I'm never backing down
I don’t ask questions I just blast it out
You feeling lucky? better reconsider
My trigger finger neva misses
Steal your Mrs., than I'll leave you fishing in the river

[Verse 2]

Step to the slaughterhouse, where it get nasty like raw meat
I turn rappers to vegans after me they don’t want beef
Serving revenge for you to eat, Miami boy because I stay with the heat
You had your mouth on the curb, but never tasted the street
Fucking wit my team and you’ll be resting in pieces
So stop fronting that mean image, your mom tells me u need Jesus
So your street dreams is a joke, hate me but you need me like a stream to a boat
I’ll leave you drowning undersea with no hope
I spit battle raps that cut under your skin like massive axes
I’m fucking the world off it’s axis until it falls into the blackness
Believe me this town ain’t big enough for the both of us
(But I can hold mics too)
Bitch you couldn’t even hold my nuts
I’ll put the Colt 45 to your head give you a fresh cut, have you spitting out wet guts
Then roast you over a fire like a chestnut
My squadron will get you caught up with a fistful of dollars
It’ll take a nation of millions to stop us but I’m still going out swinging regardless
You can’t weight me down I’m the underdog, heavyweight
Blowing pounds, round for round I’ll have your eyes shut make you meditate
Getting no love, besos or denero I have you killed for three pesos
The flow be ova your head like halos now you dead

[Hook]
