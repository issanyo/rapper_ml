[Verse 1]
Yo I grew up in Mid-City near World on Wheels
After Reaganomics crack came and more blood spill
I gotta tell shorties now I don't pop pills
The only ecstacy I fuck with rolls with Jalil
No grip, straight line rhymes
Like the grand concourse on 149
In LA the riders ridge was Fairfax and Olympic ???
On the block the Ethiopians kick it (salaam)
You'll learn Angel City'll test you
I move through giving respect where respect's due
Ducking these cops who say they serve to protect you
And handlin my biz so I ain't tryin to impress you
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
It's Alchemist with Dilated, that's family

[Hook]
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real fiends cop two each
The game is keeping dope in the streets
So look the world on wheels
Still a couple lessons I can teach
How the real heads rock real beats
Bangin out the illest rides on the streets
Look at the world on wheels

[Verse 2]
Peace King, peace haki, peace queen
I only leave em in pieces if they step in the ring
They're fumbling and wondering what weapon to bring
I'm like Ice-T, I know my lethal weapon'll swing
Stop the presses, block the doors
Cops oppress us, watch the wolves
But all the friendly fire is worse than oppression
Pressure more stressin is poured in dead presidents
(Rakaa) Fights for your rights is my pleasure
But suckers swing rulers like swords that try to measure
While Slick Rick the ruler's at war with INS yo
I hope the young fly their best yo
Hip-hop desert again, it's like Busy Bee's buzzin again
My patience is thin though
I ventilate em like I cracked the window and air it out like a Hail Mary to
The end zone

[Hook]

When I'm all out, I cause panic (peace summits)
When I move stealth (it's mysteries and who-done-its)
I made mental notes of who's fam and who frontin
Mental notes of who ran shit and who runnin
It's mind over matter, crew over money
I do strategy, I don't act sporadically
I contemplate, cat I move mathematically
Create to devastate crew, that's family

[Hook]
