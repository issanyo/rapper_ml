[Verse One: Twin Gambino]
It's the B-I-G, T-W-I-N-S - and Queensbridge is where we rep
For holding techs, mack nine, four pounds and shotties
You don't wanna get bodied so fix your face
Before I air that ass out, go to court and beat the case
It's real like that, I have no feelings inside
Maybe cause my twin brother died in front of my eyes
And it hurt 'til this day like a pain in my chest
That's why I stay vexed, in the hood sippin on Vex
Wishin I could get a check instead of robbin somethin all the time
It's about crime, but we gotta give it up
Before they put me behind bars with no parole
I love old gold too much, I gotta stay on
Plus the orgies and shorties be blessin me all day
Even at a buffet they do what I say
We gon' start from the ground 'til we rise to the top
If not dunn, we gon' run up in these thangs with the Glock
And pop, anybody jump in my way
'Cause Gambino don't play when it come to the cake

[Verse Two: Twin Gambino]
Fuck life, that's how I feel when a nigga tryna front
You get laid down with the double-barreled pump, you chump
Serve months, what you want I'm right here
I'm a grimy ass nigga that love to drink beers, for years
I been tryna wipe the tears
Take one step at a time 'til the top of the stairs
Y'all niggas scared, 'cause the Grimy One always come prepared
With two guns blazin, no matter the year
Chill at your moms funeral and body you there
We don't care, my goal is to get the chair
I did so much shit, I'm surprised I'm here
We don't fear, we don't care, we right here
