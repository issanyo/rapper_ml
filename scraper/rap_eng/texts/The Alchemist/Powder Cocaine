[Chorus: Catero]
These voices inside of my mind they will try
To drive me insane
But everything's fine if I try to remain
Like powder cocaine

[Verse 1: Evidence]
I be fine like powder cocaine
And that's a hell of a drug, and that's a hell of a saying
They need elephant trunks to get it off of the plate
I wanna better myself, they wanna dwell in the pain
I wanna better my health, no umbrella for rain
And that's a hell of a bug, I wanna live in my dreams
Got an ocean in mind, they wanna settle for streams
I wanna settle for more
I wanna get knocked down so I could settle the score
Better than before as if that was possible
To shake the demons of my mother in the hospital
Drove to a mansion and wrote this shit in front of it
'Cause everybody covets the comfort of us becoming it (rich)
And that's a hell of a drug, I caught a hell of a dream
Caught a hell of a bug, fuck irrelevant things
I've been moving at the speed of my life
Ignorant to the price, I be fine like powder cocaine

[Chorus: Catero]
These voices inside of my mind they will try
To drive me insane
But everything's fine if I try to remain
Like powder cocaine

[Verse 2: Slug]
I never boarded your plane, but I crossed your border
Got a pocket of nails and we can prop these boards up
I caught a fish this big like I would die for your sins
If it would cure my boredom
I want knowledge of self and also everything else
But the gravity helps, yeah, reality's real
When I finally fell, I told my family
"Well, when a battery dies it goes to battery hell"
Bent, intent, inflict a dent in the cement
Magnificent, brag like Sisyphus
Boast like the host with the most upvotes
I bought a spot in coach but got the bump-up hopes
It goes fine like the spot on my brain
Put my nose in the book, from the top of the chain
You stood over to look like dinner and it's not a complaint
But I'm almost halfway out of the rain (I'm fine)

[Chorus: Catero]
These voices inside of my mind they will try
To drive me insane
But everything's fine if I try to remain
Like powder cocaine
These voices inside of my mind they will try
To drive me insane
But everything's fine if I try to remain
Like powder cocaine
