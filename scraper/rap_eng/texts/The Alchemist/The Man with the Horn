[Intro]

[Verse 1: Alchemist]
Stumbled out the bar, vision blurry
Humphrey Bogart face underneath the brim of my derby
Button the pea coat, [?]
Head spinning made me spit up the Bourbon
Nauseous from the gutters steaming
All I see is titty bar signs buzzing and headlights beaming
Closing hours at the jazz club
Seats on the table, the waiter's sweeping
I'm just a creep in the city that's full of roaches and junkies that's never sleeping
Heart is cold, my pockets broken
Now I'm frozen and stoned with no emotion
Another bum riding the train without a token
Digging in my pocket, coming up empty
Limousines splash puddles and drench me, damn

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Oh No]
Walk in the club right when the party's done
I see smut and filth on the ground with gum
It's looking like a scene out of Old Vegas
Night time and the jazz jukebox is playing
I'm chilling waiting for the club owner
Pouring shots of tequila until that liquor start pouring over
To get a light buzz, the black light's plugged
Bartender counting the money and licking her thumbs
See I'm dirty but that there's a dirty foul mouth
Pour another shot to rinse it off clean and kill that foul out
Just a couple of nobodies with no bodies
She off of that old molly and drunk probably
Still waiting to be paid
Like a drunken drummer that don't know how to behave
(Some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets)
And then we come back in a new wave

[Interlude 2]
