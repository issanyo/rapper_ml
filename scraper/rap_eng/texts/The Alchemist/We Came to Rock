[Intro: Mickey Avalon & Andre Legacy]
Yo, whenever you're ready
[?] (Dyslexic)
Make it hot ([?])
We came to rock ([?])
And we can't be stopped

[Verse 1: Dirt Nasty]
Sunset Strip, high as shit
Lipstick dick, like Nikki Sixx

[Mickey Avalon]
Picture this is '86, and (I wanna rock!)
Like Twisted Sis'

[Andre Legacy]
Listen, bitch. Dyslexic is
In the mosh pit on some hashish shit

[Dirt Nasty]
West Coast kids straight rock the beat
And we back in Mayte, Tommy Lee

[Mickey Avalon]
Hey, Pamela... Pantera's manager
Who's got the drugs, the judge or the janitor?

[Andre Legacy]
We are the World, let's reunite America
Afrika Bambaataa meets Metallica

[Dirt Nasty]
No guns, no roses
Couple troubled hoes toasting champagne with Moses

[Mickey Avalon]
If you wanna know the cats who wrote this
Mickey, Andre, and Dirt Nasty, the dopest

[Chorus: Dirt Nasty, Mickey Avalon, & Andre Legacy]
We came to rock
Make it hot
'Cause we can't be stopped, and
We came to rock
Make it hot
'Cause we can't be stopped

[Verse 2: Dirt Nasty]
I walked in the party butt naked
Playing air guitar like I was Eddie Van Halen

[Mickey Avalon]
Hailing from part unknown
Avalon, 5'10", all skin and bones

[Andre Legacy]
I've known to rock the Terrordome
Like Chuck D or Axl Rose

[Dirty Nasty]
What's that taste in the back of my throat
Is it E, K, G or the O's?

[Mickey Avalon]
Choke the chicken while I chew the cat
My baby likes to shave it, but it just grew back

[Andre Legacy]
Who's that dude bumpin' Slayer
In a pumpkin-orange Buick LeSabre?

[Chorus: Dirt Nasty, Mickey Avalon, & Andre Legacy]
We came to rock
Make it hot
'Cause we can't be stopped, and
We came to rock
Make it hot
'Cause we can't be stopped

[Verse 3: Dirt Nasty]
Knocked out with my cock out
In the back of the cop car in front of your momma's house

[Mickey Avalon]
Is it Mickey Mantle or Mickey Mouse?
It's Mickey Avalon, slip a Mickey in my mouth

[Andre Legacy]
It's about to get crazy
'Cause my pagan girl gon' sacrifice a baby

[Dirt Nasty]
Front row at the Maiden concert
Bigger dick than the Eddie monster

[Mickey Avalon]
I got a whole lot of nothin' but I own the world
I do a whole lot of fuckin' but my toes don't hurt

[Andre Legacy]
Girl, sorry I didn't call
I fell asleep watching Hairbangers Ball

[Chorus: Dirt Nasty, Mickey Avalon, & Andre Legacy]
We came to rock
Make it hot
'Cause we can't be stopped, and
We came to rock
Make it hot
'Cause we can't be stopped
