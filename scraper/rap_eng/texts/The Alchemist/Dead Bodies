[Intro]
(Sample)
We out in this.. pen game'll blow that bitch up
From the world's most infamous, first Infantry
Game: Yo Alchemist, this shit raw like fresh beef nigga
We boyz 'n the hood, wanna see a dead body?

[Verse 1: The Game]
Sittin' in a lowrider, with murder on my mind
Cause' I had too many dead homies in my lifetime
That's why I ride with a nine and them hollow tips
Lift niggas like a chrome hydraulic switch
With a hood rat in the car that swallow dick
So good that I got P on that 6-4 Impala shit
She from Compton just like me
Caramel with extensions just like Eve
She wanna go to a Knicks game, sit next to Spike Lee
We''ll do the right thing, blow a nigga out his Nikes
She married to The Game, thatss wifey
Ask Gotti get them blood stains out your white-T
P in the backseat finger fuckin' her girlfriend
That'll put a golf ball hole in your right cheek
Start trippin over colors like Ice-T
And you can watch your life slip away through an I.V

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
We out in Cali, P and Game straight blow that bitch up
We out in New York, P and Game'll blow that bitch up
You can't stop us, we gettin' this money its not bangin'
You can't pull that shit this way, we head bangin'
With them Glocks and them oo-ops
Me and my fools shoot, why you tryin' to do that
I suggest you do not
My chain is hot, what's more hot than that
That's how I murda' music, that's why your broads on my back
Got two birds on my shoulders, they all over me
And ready to fuck Game and whoever else roll with me
My presence is strong, I have a bitch seein' dollar
Signs spots stare at me too long
Have you seein' that white light you come at me wrong
Or any one of my dogs, I'll be settin' it off
You was raised on beef and live real drama
Don't let the coupes twist you, we lettin' o's off

(*A-A-A-A-A-Alchemist*)
Prodigy: We out in this. P and Game, we'll blow that bitch up
(Queensbridge)
Game: P and Game rollin' the Dutch
(From the world's most infamous, first Infantry)
P and Game straight blow that bitch up, mixed with the A-L-C
(Alchemist 'been my nephew for a minute)
(Mobb Deep and all that)
Prodigy: N-Y-C to L.A. we do our sweep

[Verse 3: The Game]
We out in Compton, P and Game lacin' Chucks
We out in Q-B, P and Game rollin' a Dutch
Dumpin' ashes out the windshield
Haze got my head spinnin' like them 24-inch wheels
Ridin' to Suga' Hill bangin' Shook Ones
On the west side highway, hand on the steel
If I like your chain then blood spill'
Cause' I ain't get a million dollars when I signed my deal

[Verse 4: Prodigy]
Nigga I'll tie your wife to a chair and blow that bitch up
You better fire-proof your crib, I'll blow that shit up
I'm all about this crime for real, this rap shit is luck
Try to score points on me, I'll fasten you up
In that smelly proof bag, real-real fast
Shoot the deuce under my arm, I'm real-real slick
Can't put a tail on me, I drive too fast
Can't put tag on me, I smoke people' ass

[Verse 5: The Game]
If you 'from the west side, nigga throw that shit up
If you 'bang to east side, nigga throw that shit up
I ain't trying to be in The Source or Double XL
I'm just trying to fuck Trina cause' Dre said sex sells
And it was either this or jail
Imagine trying to fit birds in a Honda Accel
And they caught on the Fed-Ex mail
So we stopped doin' business and chirpin' on Nextels we gangstas

[Verse 6: Prodigy]
I fold people in half, I tore people' ass
But they still wanna ride out as long as we see death
I get money, and I don't need your help or friendship
But love, I'mma survive just how I 'been
I'mma stay alive 'till the day I die
But right now I'm healthy, niggas better get up off my
A bitch is nuttin' we easily fuck it
And we posessed by the cash and these guns we bustin'

(*A-A-A-A-A-Alchemist*)
Prodigy: We out in this. P and Game, we'll blow that bitch up
(Queensbridge)
Game: Ain't nobody fucking with us
(From the world's most infamous, first Infantry)
Game: G-UNIT, mixed with the A-L-C
(Alchemist 'been my nephew for a minute)
(Mobb Deep and all that)
