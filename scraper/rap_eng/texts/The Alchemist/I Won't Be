[Refrain]
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up, uhh! (yeah)
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up, uhh! (yeah)
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up, uhh! (yeah)
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up, uhh! (yeah)

[Chorus]
If I ain't never been beat by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been dissed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been robbed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been killed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been beat by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been dissed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been robbed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't keepin it real wit niggas, I won't win

[Verse 1]
Defeat glory, rather it's deep stories or helluva quotes
Never below, better than dope, off to the side
Watchin' you play games like the veteran coach
If what you spit off the top's never been wrote
Then why you all punchlines, you tellin' a joke?
I'm never right, you'll forever be the best
I'll never be less than the best
Physically Christ, you guessed cuz never it's like
Equivalent to forever twice
The exception to the word perfection
I'll never be broke, if I ain't sellin' you rap, I'm sellin' you coke
Just when you thought I couldn't get better, I spoke
And sendin you back to the lab
What would you equal after the math, I'm tellin' results
I'm bad as they come, time flys, I'm havin' some fun
The second I spoke, the battle is won, what

[Chorus]
If I ain't never been beat by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been dissed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been robbed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been killed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been beat by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been dissed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been robbed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't keepin' it real wit' niggas, I won't make it

[Verse 2]
I'll be hated, takin' rap to where it's never been taken
Say "never say never" but never's forever mistaken
I'm hopin to change my name, get spoken in vain
Niggas is broke in the game, still hopin' for change
You ain't feelin' me, you feelin' energy
Instantly sent
Lettin' you know I'm the epitome of what the shit'll be
Hater-proof resistant, say the truth
Ain't nobody like mines, you try to bite mines and break a tooth
We stay on the outside the chalk lines
Leavin you inside outlined, try to doubt mines and you can die
Just think if the game had no Royce
It be niggas wit fame and fans that should hate him but have no choice
I'm blowin' so much I'm glowin'
All throughout my camp is showin'
They all my niggas that I trust cuz' I know em
We movin' toward the cheddar, the more the better
So when you say "never" make sure it's forever, (what)

[Chorus]
If I ain't never been beat by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been dissed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been robbed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been killed by niggas, I won't be

If I ain't never been beat by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been dissed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been robbed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been killed by niggas, I won't be

If I ain't never been beat by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been dissed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been robbed by niggas, I won't be
If I ain't never been killed by niggas, I won't be

[Refrain Outro]
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up, uhh! (yeah)
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up, uhh! (yeah)
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up, uhh! (yeah)
