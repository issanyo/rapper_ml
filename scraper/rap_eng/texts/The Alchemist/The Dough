Intro: Yeah yeah...
You know we always gonna come through
Not playing no games or whatever
Yeah yeah, that's right

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo I'm up 4 in the morning making some new shit
I just keep going and going when everybody quit
I don't stop I'm a fiend, way more than Rakim
It's not the mic that I like, it's the song when it's finished
Niggas can't seem to rock it, but I be in the pocket
Your rap doesn't flow with the beat, you need to stop it
They buying into my story because my shit real
You never do what you say, that's why you don't sell
I ain't beefing on a record, somebody gonna die
And you can beef about it when you read about in the Times
Ain't no bullshitting nigga I'm a rare species
Every ten years they make a nigga like P'

[Hook]
Imma slow it down, so you can hear me out
And really really listen and see what I'm about
You feel me on the right, you feel my on the left
They feel me in the back...
It's all about the dough, that's how we stay alive
I like to see you try to eat and you ain't got a dime
It's all about the dough, that's how we stay alive
I like to see you try to eat and you ain't got a dime

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
All I do is wake up and make hits
At 15 I mastered the 16 bars, with some henny and a spliff
Now you can't tell me shit
Give me one hour with a dope ass beat, and I'll show you how to spit
You ain't got no war stories, nigga you ain't got shit
Because we ain't trying to hear your little songs for the chicks
And that bitch want it hard not a RnB thug
She like it real rough, nigga you the sweet stuff
Ha, cream puff nigga, I need you
So they can tell the difference between me and you
Yo I wake up every morning and I write a new smash
I don't do this for the radio I do this for the fans
Do it for the block
This is for my niggas that's locked up in a box
In the maxi max, that's the penitentiary
My pen will never cease
Shit my pops gave ten years, to the federales
From Georgia to Cali, He broke out of L.A County
With the cuffs on, my pops was rowdy
Then caught him out in San Jose, you know the bounties
If you can see me now, living like the sallies

[Hook]

Outro:
Yo we gonna get this money real quick
Fuck what you talking about...
