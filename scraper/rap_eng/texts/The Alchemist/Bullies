(chorus Therapytherapper)
You thought you had problems bigger than any boy
Dude you must be on steroids
When i see you in the streets you gonna get hit
Kick you on the ground then i spit
Ill teach you a lesson for what youve done
Your not better than anyone
We are all different in our own way
If you try your shit again ill have to spray
Fuck with me youll also have to fuck with bully j
Just stop your shit and say okay
You hit another kid youll permanently lay
All you bullys we will have to discuss
There will still be hope for all of us
(Verse 1 Bully'J)
Yeah
Tired of how you bully these kids
Just for stupid little bids
That you do to get more popular
I was one of those kids once, push and pulled
By you mother fuckers who were trying to mold me into someone i wasn’t
I was sent to the hospital all black and blue
Covered in mil doo
Because i was jumped and thrown in the dirt
And no matter how hurt i was you didn't care
You jumped me, here, their, everywhere
Telling me i needed to learn a lesson
Bitch fuck anger management, i needed a therapy session
Because i went to school one day and saw you two
My eyes were black and blue
And when i made eye contact with you
You ran to the otherside of the hall
Just to throw me into the locker, but that wasn't all
People saw what you did and started a brawl
That night i went home, crying all night
Cause my parents were right
I needed to stand up for myself and be a man
When i got knocked down i need to stand
Man up and fight
And sometimes when life bites
Knock its teeth down its throat
Because i”ve  been thrown off the boat
To many times for it to happen again
You’re the reason i spill my heart through this pen
Because of you i'll never be myself again
So when i went to school i walked right up to them and knocked both of them out, and then
While they were down i yelled FUCK YOU! And walked away
Now everyday bully's leave me alone
Cause they know, i will break everyone of their bones
My fists are all bone, feel like stones
Now i defend anyone from bully's cause of what they did to me
Because what they do is wrong
Something no kid should go through
But i do have to thank you
If it wasn't for you i wouldn't be who i am now
So everyone better take a bow
Because Bully J just stepped into town
Looking for all the bully's to take them down
I don't have much more to say
Other than who thought i”d be like them anyway
Well i am and my name is Bully J
( chorus Therapytherapper)
You thought you had problems bigger than any boy
Dude you must be on steroids

Kick you on the ground then i spit
Ill teach you a lesson for what you’ve done

If you try your shit again i’ll have to spray
Fuck with me you'll also have to fuck with bully j
Just stop your shit and say okay
You hit another kid you’ll permanently lay
All you bullys we will have to discuss
There will be hope still for all of us
(Verse 2 Bully J)
I swear you just bully for fun
Im sick of it im done
Everyday these kids you bully invision
You getting involved on a 10 car collision
To get you off their case for just one day
For that i have so much to say
But let me make this long story short
I still remember being bullied
Day after day it was like a never ending spiral
You would put videos of me on youtube and they went viral
Now i feel bad for what these kids have to go through
Because of you they don't know what to do
Other then suicide, now they're killing themselves because of you
Feel bad yet? Guess not
Your lucky we never met
Cause your damn straight it won't be pretty
I’m sick and tired of your petty drama and bullshit
Cause you still won't admit
That everything you do is wrong
Cause you think it's right
Im gonna laugh when you fuck with the wrong dude and get shot on sight
Because it's what you deserve
I will always put my foot down and stand up for what's right
And i believe you need to stop acting like a bully
Cause you can't push or pull me
Im like a brick wall,  just something you can't get through
And when you try it just hurts you cause their is nothing you can do
You fuck with me you fuck with all of us included
I know something about you everyone should know
You may bully people but  when you pick a fight your a no show
Its like your a gun with no ammo
Your intimidating on the outside but you have nothing on the inside
(haha) ha thats funny, also how can you be rich if you have no money
Your right to you nothing can compare
But what do i care
Your just a scum in this deep dark volcanic pit of despair
Rotting away
Day after day
Until this mother fucker erupts and it lights up this place
Like fireworks on the 4th of july
Your a living lie
My name is bully-J
So if you got something to say say it to my face
Cause no matter what you do
Ill be the one walking out of this place not you
