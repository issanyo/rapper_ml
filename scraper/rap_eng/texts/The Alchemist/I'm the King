[Intro]
What, 5'9", I'm the King
What, yeah, what, yo

[Chorus]
I'mma rhyme 'til I can't rhyme no more
Burn 'til I can't burn no more
Shine 'til there's no shine no more
'til the Earth can't turn no more
Until I'm 5'9" no more, I'm the king

I'mma rhyme 'til I can't rhyme no more
Burn 'til I can't burn no more
Shine 'til there's no shine no more
'til the Earth can't turn no more
Until I'm 5'9" no more, I'm the king

[Verse 1]
Y'all niggas is real cocky on the street 'til I drop you on ya knees
Knock you on ya feet, I'm like Rocky on the reach
I rain while you hope to sustain dope in this game
Somethin' you can't stop, you can only hope to contain
I can aim so I blaze my tool
I got a name from usin' pocket change to pay my dues, niggas know
I'm sharp as a shank and about as soft as you think
I'm hangin from the cross of your link, you get offered a drink and
Niggas is fast learners, you're only as hot
As the back burner from mad rappers and clap burners
Talk to the foot thinkin' you real
I'm starin' at the face of ya bill forgettin' how George Washington looks
You came to box a nigga that's flat out dirty
Just name the spot and I'll be there a half hour early
I write for the purpose to express a view
A nigga that's wack? You a nigga that I don't like as a person

[Chorus]
I'mma rhyme 'til I can't rhyme no more
Burn 'til I can't burn no more
Shine 'til there's no shine no more
'til the Earth can't turn no more
Until I'm 5'9" no more, I'm the king

I'mma rhyme 'til I can't rhyme no more
Burn 'til I can't burn no more
Shine 'til there's no shine no more
'til the Earth can't turn no more
Until I'm 5'9" no more, I'm the king

[Verse 2]
I'm in shape to give you a quick whoopin', hard asshole in the wall
Frownin' up, niggas thinkin' you sick cause you sick lookin', I'm heated
And I'mma go to trial blowin' my triggers
Y'all niggas ain't rough, you need to smile more in ya pictures
Split somebody, and serve the nigga whose style you bit
That bit like ten niggas that bit somebody
Top of the world, all that's around you is beneath me
Me learnin' from your mistakes is the only way you can teach me
More thunder, cockin' big heat
So undergrounds niggas wit' beef can get more under, 6 feet
Man ya missles, I plan to diss you
Unleash wit' about 30 punches before the first lands and hits you
Niggas I doubt y'all cause I'm an outlaw
Right-handed, built with a left that can out arm wrestle a southpaw
Gun shine bright, y'all niggas? Y'all need to rhyme like 5'9"
Unsigned with hype, King

[Chorus]
I'mma rhyme 'til I can't rhyme no more
Burn 'til I can't burn no more
Shine 'til there's no shine no more
'til the Earth can't turn no more
Until I'm 5'9" no more, I'm the king

I'mma rhyme 'til I can't rhyme no more
Burn 'til I can't burn no more
Shine 'til there's no shine no more
'til the Earth can't turn no more
Until I'm 5'9" no more, I'm the king

[Outro]
I'm the king (On the microphone)
I'm the king (No, no I ain't jokin')
I'm the king (That's in command, that's in command)
I'm the king (On the microphone)
I'm the king (The funk rhymin' master)
I'm the king (That's in command, that's in command)
I'm the king
