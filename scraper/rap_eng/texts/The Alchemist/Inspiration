[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Lemme out right here
Uh
Inspiration was all within the crates waiting
For the homie to rediscover, reshape it
I maybe smoked a half a fatty while he made it
Crafted by the masters
The coupe ensues additional chapters
Honda Prelude, super-tuned fast one
Driven by a lady assassin
Scaling the walls of your mansion
You was just lamping
Never imagining some shit like this could transpire
You had the juice but now its expired
The streets is tired
That work done been stepped on too many times
You tried to stretch it too far
You done crossed the line
Now your name is mud in the streets
The fiends won't buy
They walk on by while I'm

[Hook: Curren$y]
Cooler than a polar bear's toenails
Oh hell there he go again
Talking that shit that leave a sucka nigga
Going home without his bitch
Spitta nigga all about his scritch
Got a plan to get rich

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Come through smelling like a zip
Flicking a 93 octane lit
I understand
That some of the folks is buying regular gas
Some riding trophy cars some was driving trash
Me, myself I'm
Top shelf high
Anything else would be uncivilized
That sucka shit is to be redirected
Corrected or chastised
Don't kill yourself trying to live that Jet Life
Poof
Put that in the uzi combine
In my Ferrari dodging crossfire
Trying not to be killed by niggas from the other side
Or the one time
That's how I survive
Nigga I'm

[Hook: Curren$y]
Cooler than a polar bear's toenails
Oh hell there he go again
Talking that shit that leave a sucka nigga
Going home without his bitch
Spitta nigga all about his scritch
Got a plan to get rich
Cooler than a polar bear's toenails
Oh hell there he go again
Talking that shit that leave a sucka nigga
Going home without his bitch
Spitta nigga all about his scritch
Got a plan to get rich

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
They did him greasy like
Brown bags of fried fish
Bring me your nose bitch
Try this
Every lion needs a lioness
I admit I'm high as shit
I'm at peace with my environment
Chollo lowriders
Ladies designed in the candy
Skulls and knives, fire, golden eyes
A Korean stock broker
Shit that wasn't no disguise
Split his wig
Throw him to the pigs
Discuss murder over cured Italian meat
Jimmy shot Johnny in the park over a Jew broad
Facing the wheel, Frankie Vallie still playing though
I'm saying though
Why the Asian shooter always got blonde hair
You rock designer jeans dog
With the ass cut out
Exotic rap pants
I make the mac 10 tap dance
Shit
