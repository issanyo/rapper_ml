Verse: Napoleon da Legend

Glorious path warriors clash it's a laborious task hordes of
Fans swarm asking us for autographs
How long the tour last? upgrade the boarding pass
Corporate logos on our jackets
For enormous cash I saved the raw
For last format raps is automatic
Hit the Tarmac and get savage
Black sabbath y'all cats lack savvy
She wanted a sugar daddy sitting on my lap with a phatty
My skin was made of Cadillac fabric check my
Posture hop on a chopper bypass the traffic
Fly ass maverick not Novinsky I'm art like Davinci
Iplay this game Mike Krzyzewski  no weapons form
Against me shall prosper
See it I'm Lionel Messi I'm God in Argentina
Partially in a league of my own rock coliseum sharply catch the victory like Jordan versus team Barkley
Veggie burgers garnished with some green parsley
I say regular shit and make it seem godly
I'm Capcom, Konami, fold u like origami never eat salami I'm raw fish and wasabi When I spit philosophies they tell me not leave
My pedagogy is uncut like pornography
I got the logic of Cockran without a law degree
It's hard for me to stay modest so gotta pardon me
This is artistry genuine article over beats bust your
Whole brain particle open when I release
Socialize with ease scuba dive
Sight-seeing in Aruba overnight with a freak
Never plan it back in the day u would get reprimanded
I was on Mount Sinai writing Ten Commandments
I'm a philanthropist giving y’all my riches black listed
At the gate knocked the doors off hinges
Not to mention they want us being smart
It's a cul-de-sack making dough like Goldman Sacks
Holding my sack
By all means like Malcom said
I vouch for the dead P.M.S. chick
Got wet the couch is red
I'm Z dragon having a ball hacksaw Jim Duggan with a big budget packing tomorrow my flight leaves polite steez bipolar rhymes schemes with speed sicker than E. coli beef verbal Pilates it's color purple in the
Lobby bust in a concentration camp murdering a nazi
Concentrate more relax like the hair on prince Dajour chilling in a mansion with a kings decor
No court dates we just play golf chicks they applause
Hit jumpers more clutch then Reggie in the playoffs
Navigating thru this chaos I learn that after
The grief life can have u look back at a masterpiece
The Past and the futures an illusion actually the presents
Is where it's at there's no place I rather b
Absolutely six pack abs with the muesli rocking
Blue jeans in the jungle like Moogli
Nothing y'all say move me I’m like Bruce Lee
In a temple off the mental compliments of yours truly
