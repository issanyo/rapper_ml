[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Rappers act tough and I call they little bluffs
And the truth comes out, you niggas ain't doing nothing
They huff and they puff and be acting all rough
When the camera on, on the internet stunting
I got the internet buzzing, the hood buzzing
Gangstas and wannabe gangstas all loving
To speak my name, shit on my name, they touching
Any nigga threatening P, you bugging
I got a thousand soldier, we dumbing
Catch P all by himself, I got something
Then puncture your flesh my blade, I'm gunning
Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan above it
To the right, to the left
Don't matter to me, I strike you to death
The only hip hop head to keep it so fresh
Got my style preserved like cans on the shelf

[Hook]
I expire these liars, move on me, get killed
Dude only mad because he want to be like the real
H-A-V-O-C, Prodigy, Mobb Deep, retweet that
Pussy, you sweet like bear meat
I expire these liars, move on me, get killed
Dude only mad because he want to be like the real
H-A-V-O-C, Prodigy, Mobb Deep, retweet that
Pussy, you sweet like bear meat
Sweet like bear meat
Pussy, you sweet like bear meat

[Verse 2]
Thugs act up when P's songs is bumping
They get all hype and want to fight, start thumping
Resisting arrest, the riot squad is coming
We tear up clubs and big bouncers get dufted
You pull out too close, your hammer get tooken
You better start shooting from over there
Look man you crazy, we crazy, so you ain't saying nothing
Just shut the fuck up, fall back or start thumping
Can't come around no more, your mouth running
Sprints through New York like that marathon Puff did
I don't rap your life, your shit corny
Your a bum, I'm a king, kneel before me
And kiss the tat on my hand, yeah that's my shit
I cut that placa off your thumb, respect my shit
You niggas jealous of P, their eyes tell it
I read body language, I'm so fucking dangerous

[Hook]
