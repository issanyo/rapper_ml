[Verse 1: Stylistik]

Ayo it kills me whenever I'm away from my studio
And my soul is itching to get a hold of some audio
For me to devour feeding the beast that's within
Waiting to wrestle with beats and all of my lyrics pin
As what I brew in the lab with my crew
Or rather should I say kitchen smells like a hell of a stew
Which is bound to get you jumping outta ya seat
After one taste of it there's no denying the heat
That I'm packing and letting loose at all of you kats
I'm the dog that's blown a fuse killing those that eat rats
And even those that don't for I don't discriminate
Care to obstruct my scope I pull and eliminate
Without even blinking if you stand in the way of me and my vision and this mission
They call impossible yet I won't listen
As the impossible I'll do and only break a sweat or two

[Chorus x2]

It's understandable
How I got them tripping looking like they animals
So irrational
Cause When I spill passion man it's magical
I be dying to write so you know it's incredible

[2nd Verse]

Dammit it kills me whenever I don't get to write
In order to release my thoughts that haunt me at night
Inspired by ghosts of my creativity
Which stay inside my head and beside my bed
Constantly making noise so that I don't get any sleep
For they want me writing a song inside of counting some sheep
That I imagine but only amount to nothing
Unlike these words I express that account for something
Being my life which I will paint whichever way I like
Using music as the brush I see a future that's bright
A future I will get to live and enjoy all I've sown
With those that sat through the time for me to have blown
Which will be crazy for I will only prove to be prophetic
In all that I speak when most thought I'd become pathetic
And not beat the odds against me they set
The referee was bought against me they bet

[Chorus]
