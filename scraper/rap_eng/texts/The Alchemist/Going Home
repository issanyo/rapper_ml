[Verse 1:]
Cause everybody’s asking for blood
Reverend King gonna take them all down to the Mississippi
And baptise them in the mud (repeat echo)
Like I said I come in the name of Jesus by the power of all that’s here

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus:][x2]
There’s a storm cloud rising
Yes, Storm

[Outro:]
Well my burdens done got headed
I wanna go home
