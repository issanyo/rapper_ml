I won't look the other way for anyone but me
And that's the only way it's ever gonna be
Cause wounds don't heal with time
They only turn to scars
A little down the line

No one but me gets out
Trust me
No one but me is gonna make it alive this time

I won't spend another day with anyone but me
It's just the way I have it worked out in my head
Cause I know the only way to go
And rid myself of this hell is when I'm dead

No one but me gets out
Trust me
No one but me is gonna make it alive this time
