[Sean Price]
P!
Sean Price
Beef Lo-Mein with the grain, the long rice
Weed smoke, slang and you lames is so right
To make fun of you like fuck you in plain sight
Daytime used to plot schemes for the night prowl
Gauge cocked, cream shot three in the nightgown
Spray 19 at the pig who popped Mike Brown
Blaze might sting, you might scream nigga, pipe down
Shhh, quiet on the set
No dogs allowed, POW, fire on a pet
True talk nigga, watch the last become first like a New York Knickerbocker
Sean sparks like John Starks
Nah, Sean ball like John Wall
Don't catch a Washington Bullet
Finger on the trigger, nigga
Now watch me just pull it
P!

[Illa Ghee]
Grand Theft Auto animal, arch nemesis
Illa Ghee speaks latitudes and kill witnesses
Mr. Murder Avenue rap until you picture it
Piss poor writing with a pissed off penmanship
Original war, metaphors are cold syphilis
Grip a 4-4, figure four the floor pyramids
Rip you in the jaw, spit extension cord syllabus
Rape you with a saw, sex, intercourse, incubus
Illa!
I'm like murder in the mezzanine
Anti-hestamine, black apocalyptic listerine
It's on fire? Then Illa lit a match to it
The five niggas in the party you know act ruthless
At this point, I write don't know how to act music
Intelligent drama for those who wanna act stupid
I fucked up somewhere down the line
But I keep a tre pound, 4-5th and a nine
Illa!
