If I had a tumor I’d name it after you
Chained to the pain and I’m sniffing all the glue
Don’t jump now c’mon little peggy sue
Christmas in June, fish myself out with the spoon
I’m on ice, skipping moons cross the endless river
Must be nice to not worry for the giver
Big dipper in the honey
Whisper to the money as it slips
Loosen your grip the cold won’t harm you
Working at the yarn barn for far too many years
Poke my eyes till I see it clear
Can a beer on the pole
I hope she hears my soul
Clearly it’s gold, I fear no man
So you can sue me with that bologna
You don’t know me homey, I don’t even know me
Ain’t got piss for a pot
I’m ripping shop every other day
You know what they say
I got the Crunk juice, now the drunk news
Front page blues
My imaginary friends can get with your imaginary friends
We can be friends but only on the weekends
Cos you’re an ugly winner
I’m the funky sinner
Do what you do now baby glue
Wavy Gravy in yah shoe
Knock em out the box car
Kill myself like a rockstar
It’s dark and hell is close but heaven’s not far
Unlock the bars, back to sleeping in a jar
Hide me under your bed or in the stall
I go home and bang my head against the wall
Pink Floyd the Barber
Darko the Martyr
I got the starter jacket
And the wallabies
Saw jesus spamming accounts asking follow me
I never heard the Joshua tree speak to me
I think it’s mute
I’m pudgy but she still thinks it’s cute
Dug me out the abyss
In little china with the duck in my fist
Tried to buy a meal with my tape but they say it’s no good
I want a deal got no time to waste in the hood
I’m Jack’s raging bile
Come in stay for a while
