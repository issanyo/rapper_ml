[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
I spit that murder, murder, murderous shit
That vocal venom, dopest rhythm
You can prolly hit the Kurt with this shit
Ain't no money in the hood [?] with the shit
And cut the middle man out, he ain't deserving the split
We get the cream with the people, divide the shit equal
Fuck the [Eagles?]
We gon' stack this paper for our sequel
That's a bar, drop a quick gem for the people
I'm a star, spitting hot lava [?] lethal

[Hook: A$AP Twelvyy & Da$H]
Money be my motivation
(I'mma get it with no hesitation)
Marijuana got me levitated
(In a rush, a nigga never patient)

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Floor at the Garden, on the arm a young Dolly Parton
So close to the game I can smell that Spike farted
Got me nauseous, my clothes smell like a cigar
Then this European bitch, she smoke a carton, uh
I beg your pardon, I'm in the drop like I'm crock of the tubs
Snuff a nigga at the Cotton Club
Popped a bar and raise a toast to the success that I'm reaching
End of the night, I'm probably fucking wreaking
Touch my cheddar, then I'm fucking squeezing
Primal instinct, I think quick
Small pond, I'm the big fish
The people watch me like I'm Big Ben
Catch me fencing out in England
Protection held on by the henchmen
They call attention when it blast
Then comes the bastard in the casket
Fight over crumbs, I want the basket
Top of Mount Olympus where I'm crafted
The slaves don't talk amongst the masters

[Hook: A$AP Twelvyy & Da$H]
Money be my motivation
(I'ma get it with no hesitation)
Marijuana got me levitated
(In a rush, a nigga never patient)

[Verse 3: AZ]
Truth be told
Gucci clothes
Soft leather Sake sippin'
Sushi rolls could never not be slippin'
No groupie hoes
I Ghadafi different, no kufi though
Uzi flow
Flawless, go foolio
Gorgeous gift of gab, I'm used to dough
I'm all this
Haters can't lie on me
Labels can't sign me
No joke, east coast, kill 'em calmly
Weed smoke, seein' those streets remind me
This motivation been gettin' since the 90s
Mansions need maintenance
I'm handsome, need patience
The truest jewelers, cash rules, I'm from the basement
Started out a student
Easily influenced
Stranded, stuck till I was handed over blueprints
Vanished, bounced back, balancin' out my movements
Smooth shit just like the murderers moved with

[Hook: A$AP Twelvyy & Da$H]
Money be my motivation
(I'ma get it with no hesitation)
Marijuana got me levitated
(In a rush, a nigga never patient)
