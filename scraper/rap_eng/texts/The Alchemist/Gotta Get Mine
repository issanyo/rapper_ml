[Hook]
If I can't eat man if I can't shine
Its just a matter of time
Before I back out runnin round wit my nine (its fucked up)
Cuz I GOTTA GET MINE

[Verse]
You know how drought feel, fiends around niggas ain't got work
Stains from my roaches, grape drink on my t-shirt
Blowin' whites back and forth, beef boy was on the block
Niggas watchin' bootleg flicks in the barber shop
Tony he was up in it, talkin 'bout dis and dat
Sayin niggas owe him money they gon' pay him or get clapped
Man when it come to the bread niggas know what im about
Nigga owe me 7 grams I'm tryna air his ass out
Call the connect four times this nigga ain't callin' back
All of sudden hes pumpin' now dat niggas ain't got crack
Banks in the projects fuckin wit' bitches that fuck bitches
Tryna get by her to give her sumthin' in her momma kitchen
This rap shit just came to me son its like I be havin visions
After being shot the fuck up I make better decisions
I sat-back taught my soldiers how to re-act
El took my trey pound and blew blacks heart out his back
The beef don't mean nuttin' to me son I'm always in drama
Shit I say in my rap is real I put that on my momma
Say a prey before I sleep, lord bless me wit sum cake
And if I die before I wake I pray the lord my soul he take

[Hook]
If I can't eat man if I can't shine
Its just a matter of time
Before I back out runnin round wit my nine (its fucked up)
Cuz I GOTTA GET MINE
