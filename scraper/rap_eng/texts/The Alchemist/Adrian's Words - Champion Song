[Dialogue from Rocky III]
...and because of that, Mickey ain't here no more...

You didn't push him into anything
He was a grown man and he did what he had to do
You have no right to feel guilty for what happened, you don't
You're a champion and you did what you're expected to do
And you did what I and everybody else thought you should do

And you wanna tell me that those fights weren't real, that you were carried?
Well, I don't believe it

It doesn't matter what I believe because you're the one that's got to carry that fear around inside you

Afraid that everybody's gonna take things away

None of it's true...it doesn't matter if I do
It doesn't matter because you're the one that's gotta settle it
Get rid of it!

Because when all the smoke is cleared, and everyone's through chanting your name
It's just gonna be us
It's just gonna be us
It's just gonna be us
