[Verse 1]
Trendsetter, I’ve been better with impecca-
Ble flows, I be bench pressin’, chin checkin’
My foes, they not impressive, Smith & Wesson how I unload
They shouldn’t question this kid’s method
The Capital F, I done rapped with the best
Check out my aura, my swagger sharp as a dagger, yes
You Hatton, I’m Mayweather; with rappin’, I’m way better
Keep yappin’, nigga, and see what happen
Picture this be at Futurama, tri-optic, third eye knowledge shit
Scholars woulda swore I went to college
A million styles and runnin’, profile, I’m stuntin’
Freestylin’ at the barbershop when I was a youngin’
Not nostalgic for me, spittin’ darts was child play
Mild-mannered before I had a world-renown name
Now, they like, “’Shawn, could you give us a bar? You’re our hero”
That hit my heart—how could I say nah? Let’s move on…
Let’s move on, check it out

[Verse 2]
If I should ever diminish, hope my soul gets replenished
Like an inmate, how I put so much time on my sentence
Hollywood swingin’ and still my mind’s in the trenches
Grindin’ instead of reclinin’, never crawl when I’m climbin’
Elevatin’ my intellect to a new plateau
Rap slow, so you could comprehend what the mack spoke
My dialect, that of a nigga on the corner spittin’ venom
To anybody who listen, a performer
Who dabbled in the street life, took it past California
Capitalized, made a killing off my recordings
Catalog almost consist of a hundred thousand bars
Y’all still catchin’ up, I see why y’all mad at ‘Shawn
And for the record, was never aiming at Nitty
And without the ‘F’, you couldn’t spell the name of my city
It’s gon’ be a lot colder this October, I’m brainstorming
Nigga, your reign on the top’s over
I got it sewn
Uh, I got it sewn, yeah

[Verse 3]
This be that rhythmatic, uncut for all the addicts
Classic shit for no particular demographic
Universal massacre, writing lyrics with a dagger
I’m relaxed, prioritizing, focusing on what matters
I hit ‘em like Democrats, hit Obama with the blame
Leave it looking like they hit the projects with a crane
I hit ‘em like Zab Judah, inspire to stack moolah
Be one of rap’s rulers, me and my staff movin’
No matter who engineer, just loop it, I’ll rap to it
Chop it, bag it, distribute it, it’s crack music
Not a boy in a box but a king on the chessboard
I run the game, and my queen the most valuable
Almost on album two, ain’t even dropped the first
And already I traveled half of the Earth
I lock the verse then I’m clockin’ out, back to the crib
Can tell I’m eatin’ by this fat on my rib, it’s what it is
