[Intro]
Good evening ladies and gentlemen
I'm your emcee for the evening
For your listening pleasure
The very beautiful

[Verse 1]
Pretty thug fucka, Queens what I'm reppin'
Tell them pussy niggas that I squeeze my weapon
Disrespect my bitch, last thing you remembering
Disrespect me, I erase your memory
My blood's so icy
You just a savage there ain't a nigga like me
Real mob nigga you don't wanna invite me
Cause you know it'd be a gang fight
Come clean I will spank every nigga in your set
Gun claps to the buttocks your new shit
R.I.P. Crazy, M.O.P. baby
Mash any nigga out when he try to play me
Okay he
Not the one for the jokes
And y'all fools funny as fuck so here we go
Keeps me on my BS looking like a fetus
Time I'm done with you, now your bitch on my penis
You never had a hardcore life
You rap really good cause you jack every line I write
I give you a hardcore right
And uplift your jaw, I'm raw like tar tar
I rather be feared than loved
I try to show love but niggas act tough, fuck 'em
Okay you win an Emmy and a Oscar
Okay I see you just an imposter

[Interlude]
Never forget (What else)
When it rains, niggas get wet
(for your listening pleasure, the very beautiful)

[Verse 2]
Pretty thug fucker, Queens' what I'm repping
Tell them pussy niggas that I squeeze my weapon
Disrespect my beats, last thing you remembering
Disrespect me, I erase your memory
I got slush blood I'm icy
My reaction is vicious, you not like me
They never wanna invite me
Cause they know my M.O. family, bitch please
I will drag every nigga in your squad
All over the concrete, show you how to brawl
You donkey of the evening, Charlamagne the god
Put you on the radio now you could tell 'em off
And brag to the world how you got your face beat
It's no makeup, you wake up with no teeth
And a long zipper straight across your cheeks
You soft like a Drake song, it's banana clip P

[Outro]
For your listening pleasure
The very beautiful
