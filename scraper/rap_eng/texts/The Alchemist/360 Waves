[Planet Asia]
Henchman hobby, machine gun rap
Ménage, casino stacks like Nino’s back in the projects
Practice perfection what I was taught
By the OG’s – the reason for me getting back to my lessons
We’re still thuggin though, we keepin it rugged beloved
I got your budget in my luggage, couple of clips, bolt cutters
Fuckin with zips, eigths and quarters, place your order
With the Warner Brothers supporters, snort up
It’s on us, on the house, line for line your mind getting blown out
My Durag Dynasty niggas throw down
Move G, rock a wave cap just like a kufi in Mecca
Rocket launcher cop cars to send a message
Militant mind, direction design
Who was signed connecting, had to tell your wifey don’t ever cook me swine for breakfast
The best is when the line is tested
I got your mind arrested, paying attention to the final second
Time to climax, a style like this
You couldn’t find with a finance assignment to a siren

[TriState]
Check it
Egyptian cloth, solid gold cross
Tabernacle talk low and behold when shells bark leave you bitten
Snoopin in the garden of the hidden false prophets
Plagiarize lines of my rhythm, divine design
Draped in the flyest vines, you niggas are blind
Can’t see me with the rhymes, it’s the massacre
Zulu passenger out of Africa, armed and deadly
Put a hit on your ambassador, toss confetti
Tip fluid out the chalice, I’m Calvin Broadus
Who can do it more malice, I splatter your cabbage
Side dish with your cold grits
You ain’t playin with a full deck go fish
Fradulent fake, felonious funk
I’m the shit with the pistol grip, ready to dunk
On your porto potty, sorta Gotti’s, acting hard body
But you really paper thin like origami
My aura Gandhi, Mr. Mandela
Malachi, Clarence X, sayonera

[Killer Ben]
Jim Jones, Charles Manson
Bruce Wayne mansion
Shawshank Redeption passion
Meyer Lansky lyric rations, antsy
My affliction addiction to cats spazzin'
And to the rim tears tatted
Word has it that I move with a ratchet
Flavor coke packet
Kill niggas in my bubblegoose Tiger Woods jacket
Got a bad habit of drinkin'
Then I put the fabric softener in the dry spin cycle
Your son's shrinkin'
?? red snapple master
Hot as fish grease
Louisiana hot sauce with fly turkish links
Niggas funny, hot dogs like pink
Standin' in line waitin' for judgement
Like burnt credit cards you get denied, nothin'
IRS duckin', got chickenheads cluckin' in the bathroom
Nostrils all dusted, lustin'
It's like I'm goin' bowling
I knock a couple queens down
But every time that I strike
Another lane opens

[Planet Asia]
This the best shit you heard in your life
We the illest out on the grind earnin' our stripes
Watch us breed like the species
And show the rest of the world that ain't nobody fuckin' wit' DRDC
It's just a theme for my G's doin' sets of ten
And from the womb it's a must to gain respect to win
Or maybe check a chin, to run wit' us you need extra skin
Cause I'm rollin' wit' the best of them
GCM USA, we everywhere like Mexicans
I'm try'na get another check again, you feel me?
That's hella guap, and you's a fucking lame
So go do what you best do, tell a cop
As my blackberry teleprops
It's like sellin' rocks
Sittin' back lookin' at all the bread I got
It's just a one off we did loosely
But that's the best shit to the point like designated pussy
I'm home ho, and I don't like shit bitch
Frontin' on the God and ridin' any other dick is a no no
My gun hold a drum roll for fingas that gung ho
Ya done know, ain't nothin' sweet when the cake funnel

[TriState]
Read the resumé
Rap sheet violent
I'll outrap you any day
Rappers need guidance
Papercut criminals can't copy the general
With minimal subliminals
Tomahawk your Seminole
It's hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full time job
But keep it real nigga
Most of y'all field niggas
Figure skatin' on a thin sheet
Grim reap, scars from the glacier only penetrate skin deep
Gut wrenchin', pulp fiction
Mind bendin', spine twistin'
Smut chickens
Yes the colonel from Kentucky with the derby brim
Lane switchin', still pimpin' out the dirty Benz
Bone collector, sound selector
Style finesser, build with the astro projectors
Known astrologists, meteorologists
Follow the novelist but can't clone my accomplishments
Complimented by accomplices, pompousness
We out do you with the confidence
I'm confident

[Killer Ben]
Mass destruction
Sarin nerve gas, bodily function
Blast, clutchin', comatose, overdosin'
Zippin' bodybags, iron flag
Flavor durag, decible dungeon
Break Bolivian crack mix
Sell it for buck a half for starters
To baptize lyrics in brown waters
Close quarters, chip off blocks
Cash out corners, tip off cops
Shots won't mourn ya
Slip off the watch, the rings and the necklace
Follow my orders
I don't think my niggas really supposed to fire head up
Spark lead up, it could be a set up
Close your eyes and get blindfold
With the shuffle hold in the deck
When the dealer calls out aces are low
Jokers are high, smokers still buy
Bullets still fly, why ask why
Stressin' too much is suicide
Vibe cyanide, mescaline mind
Iodine line
Masonic symbol on my cloak and dagger rhyme
I'm
