Showing no signs of letting up
Still kick you in the head like I think
You on the verge of getting up
No mercy, Cobra Kai, Cobra commando
Deadly venom spitting, niggas just a salamander
I'm living the life worthy capturing on camera, documented
How one of the last lives was deaded
How I rolled up in the drop, how I rolled up that sticky
How I rolled with them women, elegant player, no sippin'
How I f*ck them to sleep?
How I woke up out the building when I was finished
Keep it G, them niggas not original they muthafucking house of mirrors
Not quite the image, I'm on that Popeye spinach
Mama mai-tai sippin, she loves a square nigga
But now she trying something different
Windy City Bulls, mention the Nets, wool jackets and sweats, Scottie Pippens
My description, high of that fuzzy green prescription
Lying if I said that I isn't
If you looking for that nigga: I is him
All eyes in this direction, a burden and a blessing

Reporting live from the devil's pad

Breakfast here: two titties, two plus and a turkey bacon sandwich
2 seeds with eggs and bread jelly
My hoes they rarely pop that pussy
They put off in my Pontiac on Pirellis '82 edition
Spotters body squatting on sixes?
Rather be counting stacks than stuck in the county, washing the dishes
Or washing drawers in the pen ?
I had to go pay the correct correctional officer to walk him in
Bail money on debt, come at my neck
Plus that boy cause that same place where him ? where he slept
I issue eternal rest, sign up and be a subscriber
The price of life that's so high that I must make sure I stay higher
Stay with the purp out of piso?
Smacking as deep as needles
They run in the rock just like I play quarterback for the eagles
Rando donovan in the mic a
'Fore I picked up this mic I was hitting licks
Did dirt with plenty disciples
I'm gang bang affiliated, federal investigated, self educated
All my co-conspirators catching cases
I got straight out of college and I made it at home ?
But believe I got the balls to clear up all of my altercations
Leave faces with operations, closed casket console
Tryna make million dollars, fuck a million downloads
But if that equal the same, smash it up and give me my change
I made a lane up in this game so niggas goin' remember the name
Gangsta Gibbs ho, two bitches cooking in the crib hoe
Still push a bucket but I ride it like a Benz hoe
Tryna find a bridge ho, to slanging raps, from slanging weight
Said the Fred the new age ? call me baby face
