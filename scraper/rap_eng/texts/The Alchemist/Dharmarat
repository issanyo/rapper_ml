Why do i feel how i feel?
Why do i feel nothing that you drop, ain't get me in my feels
Why these raps gotta rhyme when poetry don't have no rules
Why do i feel how i feel when i see you with good news
The fuck? used to fuck around with uncles drugs
Snorting up some white powder i ain't have no clue what it was
Shit would fuck me up now i ain't taking up no dust
I'm just leaving you in mine, how i look from behind huh?
Dropped times, d5, vsb, fuck with me
No one got the drive to be up in my fuckin league
Gotta say that cos i hate myself low key
If she ever left me think i won't be, never mind
I just miss her she in fiji, can't wait till she leaving
Miss my cousin too i think i needa cop a ouija
Board/bored im at home got no friends that wanna kick it
Except ones who live in city so that ain't about u nicolas
No shots, hate drinkin sittin sinkin in my thoughts
Tryna get poppin, make my weekends eventful
Sittin here ain't feelin special but i outdid alla you
Act like you are next to drop but never follow thru
See me off a lot of brews smiling never talkin to u
I am alright but you can still cop a deuce deuce

Lets talk fear, fear of what the fuck i'm bout to say next
Fear of seeing my hand go to mommas with a blank cheque
Fear, fear of consequences that my words bring
Fear of helping myself while you're hurting
