[Verse 1]
I don't want to dougie, I just want money
Studied under the understudy the one-twenty
Young dummies can't spar
No life, my flow tight, like your pants are
You don't got a chance, Pa, Ansaar community
Malachi York fricasse, yo fuck a eulogy
Fuck jewelry; what jewelry
I took this from another rapper
Slapped him with the toolie, G
Cornball rappers, I see you on BET
Relieved of their jewelry, interview Beef DVD
P TNT, the flow dynamite
Niggas so-so, bozos ain't rhyming right
I hit a line of white, I smoke a dub of green
Niggas call it purple, what the fuck you mean
Fuck a fistfight, I'm gunning you rappers
I don't give a fuck about none of y'all rappers
Fifth spray shit, the piff stay lit
My bitch stay dipped with the Richard Bey tits
Niggas say shit, they say it ain't shit
Shut the fuck up nigga I'm nothing to play with, P
I bust heaters at your whole damn clique, blaow
Sean Price, the leader of Boot Camp Clik now
Admire the admirable animal rap
Smack the shit out of a nigga and hand him his hat
Banging on wax, niggas don't bang in the street
Banging online, niggas don't bang in the street
Playing for keeps, keep playing
I slam your ass on your face til your fucking teeth breaking
P, the jerk that retired, I'm nice so I'm back niggas
Smack earth, wind, fire, and ice out that nigga
Rap niggas, I doubt if there's
Nigga doing it like me, fuck outta here, P
