Eight thousand degrees
Now I'm talking Fahrenheit
Core power
Just feeling it
That shit is like pristine
I got the insight
Many want to bite off microphones
Yo but I come down with
Different kind of poems than that today
We display
Hella innovative
Hella creative
This is hella elevated
I feel the soul in this
Feel the flow in this
They call me eggroll of soul
Back in the day kid
Because I'm Chinese and Asian
With the vocal devastation
Yo but I got poetic persuasions
For all my people of different races
And this ain't about race yall it's about culture
A little deeper than that

Crucial relevance
We got the crucial relevance
We got the crucial relevance
We got the crucial relevance
We got the crucial relevance

DJ Surface in the place
He's cutting know what I'm saying
