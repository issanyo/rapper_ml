[Hook 1: Rakaa Iriscience (Evidence)]
The strong prey upon the weak
This is where I learned to stand on my own feet
So much I see
(On the streets of Venice Beach is where I cut my teeth)
So much I see
(On the streets of Venice Beach is where I cut my teeth)
So much I see
Cut my teeth

[Verse 1: Evidence]
I remember how it all began
I used to switch graffiti tips on cans with both hands
No chance, I knew they couldn't stop this rush
Our bus bench was a stop, and they ain't stopping the bus
I caught the fever, at sixteen I copped a beater
Now it's me against the world, sit in my own two-seater
I drove slow on roads that lead freedom
What I believe in, known that I'd be leaving
Let me in jump up the timeline to currents events
I went around the world twice on award tours, it never ends
Mike Will did, but others didn't make it
Others still hungry, so the others gonna take it
Shit is basic when you put it in the pot and let it simmer
Like the sun been setting later in the summer than the winter shit
Where I'm from I keep the oven sizzling
I cut my teeth at Venice Beach then hit my peoples with some of the wisdom

[Hook 2: Rakaa Iriscience]
The strong prey upon the weak
This is where I learned to stand on my own feet
So much I see
On these mid city streets is where I cut my teeth
So much I see
On these mid city streets is where I cut my teeth
So much I see
Cut my teeth

[Verse 2: Rakaa Iriscience]
I learned a nickel cost more than a dime before I learned to rhyme
Crenshaw and Venice, St. Charles is more specific
Then Pico and Fairfax, the Ethiopian district
Everything changes, noticing both of them look different
I can think back though life goes on so keep living
Didn't step to OG's on the block to seek wisdom
Or I'd be cripping, but they teach the street systems
Street soldiers and street politicians, I'd keep listening
Smoking in the homey's rental, blazing instrumentals
Something like a steel elephant trunk came through the window
Eyes traced the barrel to a friendly face (caught you slipping)
Broke the blunt, gave us back the lit half and kept dipping
Had that beach cruiser whipping, then stopped, he turned around
Came back and told me, "It's a war zone, go home
Draw something, matter of fact, write something raw for me
Call you tomorrow," that was the last time that I saw him
But I took it as a sign, standing at the crossroads
I saw a different world was mine, it was with me all the time
Appreciative, never satisfied, inspired to climb
Eyes wide, mid city lit that fire inside

[Hook 3: Rakaa Iriscience (Evidence)]
The strong prey upon the weak
This is where I learned to stand on my own feet
So much I see
(On the streets of Venice Beach is where I cut my teeth)
So much I see
On these mid city streets is where I cut my teeth
So much I see
Cut my teeth
