[Intro]
Nigga's so fucking stoned
Can't smoke weed to it, I don't wanna listen to it
Yeah
Started this shit in '97 nigga, Pittsburgh
Real niggas who like real rap
Born in 1987

[Verse 1]
Damn I don't want no trouble
I just wanna kick back with my Taylors on
Smoke my weed, live life like a player
Learn the game, man there's levels to this shit
Angels and all kinds of devils
Fighting and scratching to bring you down
When you gone want you back around
In my '62 'cause I love the sounds
Remember copping navies now we rolling up from pounds
Regular weed, now it's loud
No bullshit I do this shit for my child

[Chorus]
All this weed rolled up now we got the lights low
Champagne popping off, living good like we supposed to
Tell your girlfriends they can leave, you ain't ready to go
You can think what you want but now you know

[Verse 2]
Hopping out the flight
Tryna find what bad one I'ma scoop tonight
I really live the dream so I'm getting in between
Money over everything
Whatever's best for my team
We travel all over the world
Not at all sober
Know some bad bitches, call 'em
My niggas actually balling
And we all do it naturally
Rich and famous and glad to be here
It's all part of the plan
For us to get ours and you get yours
Bouncing up the street in a '64
Smoking weed thanking God that things ain't how they used to be
You smell it, you ain't smoking it
Lost a pack on the road, hope they ain't opened it
We film movies like Universal Studios
Six rolled, four smoked, two to go
Y'all niggas know what the fuck it is, man

[Chorus]
All this weed rolled up now we got the lights low
Champagne popping off, living good like we supposed to
Tell your girlfriends they can leave, you ain't ready to go
You can think what you want but now you know

[Outro]
This shit ain't never gon' stop
[?] on them boards
Alchemist on the beat
KK in a Raw cone
Excuse me, I rolled this J
Khalifa papers
[?] in the booth
