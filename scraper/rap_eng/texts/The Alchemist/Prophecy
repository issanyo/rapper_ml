[Verse 1]
As heavy as Heaven, I'm working like 7-Eleven
And my thoughts getting hectic, in need of a blunt and Excedrin
Niggas gon' hate, but it's only nature, so fuck it, I let 'em
Shit, I'm just focused on the goal, cause I know where I'm headed
If I can help it I'mma die a legend
Live a wild life, die hard, and let my children tell it
Shit, I'm closer to my dreams, bruh, I can even smell it
So close sometimes I even notice that my friends are jealous
Whoever knew it'd be this hard, breaking in on this rap shit
Left college to try to feed mama so I can't quit
In the midst of these niggas just flaking like they dandruff
I'm a real nigga, break again and check my stance, bitch
Pinky ring blinging, I got the juice now
Ball in my court so sport's playing the truth now
Let a nigga loose, now you fools saying he too wild
I'm the new child who turning booths into Nuketown
This is prophecy, nigga

[Verse 2]
You determine what your future holds
So get up off that bullshit you niggas on, make a hustle, get this dough
I knew ten years ago this nigga's flow was meant to blow
Now I'm in my zone and you niggas slow, I'm shifting go
I'm never looking back, in fact, I'm drifting on a different road
Still sticking to the script, you niggas will never get my soul
I don't make records for radio play, nigga, no
But still the inspiration for niggas who ever lived it, bro
You can make it, nigga, just get your mind right
Get your grind tight and attack whenever the time's right
Even non-patients still blinded by the limelight
Waiting for the moments I been hoping like my whole life
I'm riding, nigga, 'til the world ends
With a gang of kush and my favorite girlfriend
Days are seeming like I'm caught up in a whirlwind
I'm putting work in and I ain't even catch my first win
