With vernacular power, I devour cowards like chowder
Saying they still love H.E.R. when they're better off without her
Weak rhymes, no flow; there's no way you'll ever pull her
Because when I spit, the strongest bar will pierce your medulla
Oblongata, there's none hotter, not even Nevada
Poetic like Espada with the mic as my espada
Cease fire, these rhymes burn like a grease fire
Get schooled, and I'll find a way to fix that 'D-minus'
You're below average, crush you lyrically; no challenge
I'm savage like Lil Uzi, with bullets aimed at your cabbage
I'm a heel like a wrestler, you're a heel like Achilles'
Smoke you like phillies, I give emcees the willies
When I rhyme, I destroy whatever is a travesty
Of this savagery I naturally spit masterly
I'm Dastardly like Speed Racer, number one track lacer
Me without hip-hop is like vodka without chaser
Blaze the mic solidly, no time for colloquy
Cause I'd rather skip that and go straight to kicking philosophy
About these new dudes that can't possibly spit as hot as me
Their flow is comedy, could barely match the great Prodigy
Rest in peace, sickle cell had got the best of thee
May your infamous legacy live on endlessly
Now I continue to keep you stuck off the realness
So feel this illness that leaves emcess in stillness
