[Intro: Prodigy, Alchemist]
Uh, ALC out this motherfucker
(A-A-A-A-Alchemist)
K-Keep the pen moving

[Chorus: The Alchemist & Sample]
That's that, that’s that I don't even think just write..
That's that, tell you somethin’, eyo listen

[Verse 1: Alchemist]
Eyo, hard work pays off so I take them days off
My phone out of control so the ringer stays off
In the lab cookin' a batch I'm just trying to cake off
Got these dudes watchin' my moves I'm just tryin' to shake off
Separate the real from the fake I'm just tryin' to break off
We’ll be in front of the whole world, and watch me take off
Made a name, rate the game now watch how we make off
Spit the loot up with the troops, watch how we break off
You ain’t cut from the same cloth, I cut a snake off
I get my weight off, many different plates that I ate off
Yeah, some are foul trying to imitate the style but they're way off
I’m a workaholic, rapping's what I'm makin' my pay off
Except I never get, laid off or take days off
Machines never turn off, switches don’t even say off
Been hearin' all the talkin' but my hair's get gray off
So I focus on the path that I'm barkin' and don't stray off

[Bridge: Prodigy]
You got me talkin' like an alien-s
Like we don't pop it off everytime
Must be out your fuckin' mind, nigga ain't rule the Grammy
And all these niggas's bitch
Plus all lost their fuckin' sense, I put 'em to bed
In broad daylight gangster, rockabye kid
Got your motherfuckin' head
Bust it low, some motherfucker head

[Chorus: The Alchemist & Sample]
That's that, I don't know nothing about Alchemist
(A-A-A-A-Alchemist)
K-Keep the pen moving
That's that, that's that
That's that, I don't even think just write..
That's that, that's that
(Check, who is it)

[Verse 2: Havoc]
It's the H dolo, same position all up in my photo
Jail pose, like being ankle tossed the floor, this ain't old
We thug clubs gettin' them hoes drunk
My home wished that in the air, we got them things in
Somethin' pop off, with the crew we finish them
I throw it back Long Island, ice tea sippin'
Bartender on my dick your drink's a little stressin'
See my niggas wilding, I tell them slow down dippin'
Keep my demeanor and you will see a difference
Niggas act up then and become bitches, grab your lipsticks
Don't do it to your self I'll have you them missing them summers
Like Jay-Z had by, I rode with nothing but gunners
Y'all feel this shit, go get the plummer
Strikes snapping from me you ain't no general thunn
Yeah yeah but I know where this thing from
How I first came in the game and got that bread son

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
You got me talkin' like an alien-s
Like we don't pop it off everytime
Must be out your fuckin' mind, nigga ain't rule the Grammy
And all these niggas's bitch
Plus all lost their fuckin' sense, I put 'em to bed
In broad daylight gangster, rockabye kid
Got your motherfuckin' head
Bust it low, some motherfucker head

[Outro: Havoc]
Yeah, uh-huh I feel this one right here
Who is it? It's about to get real hot
If it ain't hot already, yeah, fuck outta' here
