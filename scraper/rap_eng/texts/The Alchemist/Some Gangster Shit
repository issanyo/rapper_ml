Give me some of that ol' gangsta ass shit, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Fabolous]
Looks like your memory need refreshin'
You couldn't do me if you were doing an impression (Nah)
Maybe I should just press charges for swagger theft
You faggots deaf, if you can't hear, I'm hot as dragon's breath (Yes)
Nah, I'm past hot, I'm the sun's mascot
When stacks on deck, I'm at your neck like an ascot
It's Loso, she all ready knows so
I said 'OK, good, tell that other hoe so'
I say 'Wassup son, you wassup son
They say your swagger's on Viagra, keep it up, son'
Ballin' is key, we start the engine with buttons
This player be limpin', call it injury struttin'
These Cardi lenses is somethin', get in this Benz and quit frontin'
I ain't gettin' no younger, bitch, I ain't Benjamin Button
Whatever you like playin', I ain't stingy with nuttin'
So I could dollar tip ya, or either hollow tip ya, let me know...
