(Chorus)
Should have called, would have fallen
Wooden, putting goods in shawls
Walking with a hood in fall
Tend to always look appalled
Funnier than all you
Vision in a brawl hue
Raw dude, lyrics befall fools

(Verse)

I’m a fan of tunes,not fan of you
Got a panoramic view of your grandma’s room
None of you rappers can manage shoes as
Big as me, too tall to extend my hand to you

Little league, fiddle with riddles, drinking griddle grease
Shittle on you little kiddle, brittle til you get all weak
Lazily placed debris scattered on the asphalt
Macking all the bad and spit attacking with a flag pole

Ask anybody and they tell you that my flow favored
Mindless violence is a no brainer, no savior
No player stacks up to my gold chainer
Bone craver, eating the leftovers of a tome’s layers

I’m a known assassin, born in a family of dome smashing
Stone cold savage animals who prey on lone maggots
Don’t catch a wiff, my body excrete poison crafted mist
Anyone in my vicinity bound to hack up ribs

Mad props, all your tracks sound like dad rock
Your music would be easier to get into with a padlock
Open the crock slap in a packet of crab sauce
Classy as jazz songs in the backwoods of bad slums

Watch as the crow contorts
Feathers and tissues scattered in the grove I guard and I got no remorse
I’m an open book, my forked tongue is the glossary
Turn the page and my skin is torn from up off of me

The chosen one, midichlorians at an absurd stat
And I don’t even fucking care if it makes you nerds mad
My version of camping is taking a dirt nap
I’m swerving at families who safe from the germs past

Been curb stomping and word flaunting for decades
Word, cock it, I earn profit and burn pockets that decayed
Goofy rappers talk ‘about being underground, I’m sick of it
Anonymous is written on my fucking birth certificate

You better not mess, lobster
I’m the lochness monster, and I’m finna clock pac esque toddler
No hope, so many hella shiny things I want
No hope, so many hella shiny things I’ll never get

Sneak past high security cameras with a feather step
Better yet I’ll set a bomb charge near the denizens
You get it yet?  Nobody can escape my unyielding wrath
Stealing cash from touchy feely cats who really ass

(Chorus)
Should have called, would have fallen
Wooden, putting goods in shawls
Walking with a hood in fall
Tend to always look appalled
Funnier than all you
Vision in a brawl hue
Raw dude, lyrics befall fools
