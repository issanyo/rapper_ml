Yo, Quit contemplation, I see the beat and fuck it up
You'd probably bust a nut conversating with a stupid slut
Lose a fuck, being uptight like dykes you'll never loosen up
I smoke the loosest stuff, but it's no fish, go fish
I spit the dopest, tryna put me out like roaches but I keep floating
Sparked up, while they still soaking wet
I keep a tech in the skill right above my neck
So technical the simple minded respect, dissect the brain
Leave none sane, I'm ill unframed in a real young lane
I steer dizzy off the liquor, morris coding ya bitch
Deciphering my mind? you'll find 666
With a blistered wrist, dawg i spit sick shit and infecting every virgin who lick my tip
I'm a sick mouth prick, but that ain't it, I'm a little more than it seems..
Like reality, but I live my own dream
