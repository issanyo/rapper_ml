[Intro: 38 Spesh]
Yo yo yo, huh
Told these niggas man
I ain't motherfuckin' playin' man, nah I'm sayin'? Right
Let's go, Trust nigga
Huh, right, let's go

[Verse 1: 38 Spesh]
Ayo, my closet filled with mostly furs
And all the guns I collected prayin' one day we hopefully purge
My shooters is real low preserved, could go for nerds
Wolves in sheep clothin', they roll in herds
From the dirt, so we chose to splurge
I'm most concerned with gettin' money, fuckin' bitches and smokin' herb
This for my niggas that open birds and choke the curb
Them the niggas that know my verses is spoken word
When I speak it's mostly verbs
I call shots and they listen, I'm seldom seen but mostly heard
Seen niggas catch cases over words
I ain't braggin' or boastin', I'm only approachin' who I'm supposed to serve
Shittin' like it's a bowl of turds
I left the whip fishbowl, that's just to get on ya homie nerves
Niggas actin' like I don't deserve
The Benz sign hangin' over the door like it say don't disturb, trust

[Verse 2: Ransom]
Buried in gold like a Pharaoh from Egypt, battle strategic
Leave ya parents and fetus paraplegic
In agreeance with elitist while talkin' ballots and secrets
Mystifyin' like a gypsy who read a tarot to speak with
And if you married the street shit, I'm forced to shoot ya
I let it ring from one knee, I'm proposin' niggas divorce the future
All you think about is the whores and hookah
The scene ugly but I came back clean, nigga, I brought the lufra
Game nice, I was born with the vocals cords of Luther
Back when I was poor and couldn't afford the boosters
Now I'm arrivin' in elegant fabrics
Buck on the dash, shorty showin' no class how she yellin' in traffic
Criminal minds and felony tactics, many theatrics
Penalties graphic, I tend to be accurate
I'm trainin' mics like Cus D'Amato while fuckin' models
Stuffin' hollows and blowin Dracos, labeled the Russian Drago
