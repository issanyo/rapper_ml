[Intro]
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ahh-ow!
Cha cha cha
Cha cha cha

[Verse 1]
O Holy motor
What's sort of magic be this
I'm just a hot flash
I'm just a wind in the mist
Speedlines
Got your head in a twist
I made a motion
What kind of magic is this

[Verse 2]
You think you're hot shit
You're just a name on a list
I crossed you out kid
I did it quick as a whip
You're gone
All at the flick of a wrist
I made a motion
And you don't even exist

[Chorus]
Can't believe you got the nerve to come after me
Coming fast, but I'm cruising at hyperspeed
Million miles, milisecond, the fastest, see
It's all part of my miracle masterpiece
You got the gall, you got the nerve to come after me
Coming fast, but I'm burning at hyperspeed
Million miles, milisecond, the fastest, see
It's all part of my miracle masterpiece

[Verse 3]
Another sucker, another buzz
But I ain't nowhere, I never was
Speedlines, speedlines
Speedlines, speedlines

[Verse 2]
You think you're hot shit
You're just a name on a list
I crossed you out kid
I did it quick as a whip
You're gone
All at the flick of a wrist
I made a motion
And you don't even exist

[Chorus]
Can't believe you got the nerve to come after me
Coming fast, but I'm cruising at hyperspeed
Million miles, milisecond, the fastest, see
It's all part of my miracle masterpiece
You got the gall, you got the nerve to come after me
Coming fast, but I'm burning at hyperspeed
Million miles, milisecond, the fastest, see
It's all part of my miracle masterpiece

[Bridge]
I made a motion
(Motion)
I'm just a line in the mist
I'm just a phantom
(Phantom)
And you don't even exist

Cha cha cha

[Verse 4]
There's my name in your mouth, and my dust in your lungs
Speedlines got the prize 'fore you even begun
There's my dust in your lungs, and my name in your mouth
Speedlines, full tale, yeah we're turning it out

[Chorus]
Can't believe you got the nerve to come after me
Coming fast, but I'm cruising at hyperspeed
Million miles, milisecond, the fastest, see
It's all part of my miracle masterpiece
You got the gall, you got the nerve to come after me
Coming fast, but I'm burning at hyperspeed
Million miles, milisecond, the fastest, see
It's all part of my miracle masterpiece

[Verse 5]
There's my name in your mouth, and my dust in your lungs
(Coming fast, but I'm cruising at hyperspeed)
Speedlines, question mark on the tip of your tongue
(It's all part of my miracle masterpiece)
There's my dust in your lungs, and my name in your mouth
(Coming fast, but I'm burning at hyperspeed)
Speedlines, full tale, yeah we're turning it out
(It's all part of my miracle masterpiece)
