[Hook]
It's the start of the ending
I'm departing but sending
This message out, the sket is out
You a target that's trembling

[Verse 1]
It goes, Hanna Barbara barbarian
Bars better than yours
And your entourage, pa, Sean bury 'em
You know how the shit go
No disco, Sisqo, or calypso
Blow piff, four-fifth, smoke mixed with indo
East African beast battering Chief Kimbo
Barefooted, stepping on hot coal
Shaka Zulu, spear chucking
You front and I'mma shoot you
Hardcore rap at its worst
Move from the morgue truck to the back of the hearse
Move from the back of the hearse to back in the dirt
Change clothes, put a pack on his turf, move on
Do Sean
Can't be me, motherfucker, your shoes wrong
Boot Camp for life, B
Nine times out of ten, you can catch me in Nikes

[Hook]
It's the start of the ending
I'm departing but sending
This kite out, it's lights out
You are marked with an emblem

It's the start of the ending
I'm departing but sending
This message out, the sket is out
You a target that's trembling
