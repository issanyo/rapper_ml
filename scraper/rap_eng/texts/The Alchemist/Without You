( verse 1)
I'm sorry about everytime i made you hurt instead of laugh
You don’t know how horrible i feel i just want to be cut in half
Cause your the last thing i ever want to lose
Nothing could ever replace you not even a luxury cruise
If you leave i'll probably go A Wall and end up on the nightly news
Cause  i cry everytime i think of you
Cause i don’t want this to be goodbye
I know that every argument we had was my fault and you were right
Everything was my fault, i just wish i had one more chance to hold you tight
And tell you i love you and there's nothing to be scared of or fright
What i did was wrong and being honest i cry every night
Because everytime i see you i burst into tears on sight
And i just want to go to my room and hide
Because without you i don't have nothing not even my pride
I know you want your space but i am writing you this song
To tell you i know i was wrong
And i'm sorry for letting you down
With you i feel like a prince waiting for his crown
But without you i feel like a hobo headed to town
With a shopping cart full of belongings
Those belongs were everything i did wrong to you
You can hangout with anyone you want even if its a guy
Cause i know you wouldn't go with him, you can’t be buyed
You are hard to earn, you could do better but i love you
And i'm stuck to you like glue
I love everything about you old or new
I felt that spark everytime we kissed
If you leave you will always be missed
And i don’t talk to my ex cause your all i want
Why would i do something like that and pull that stunt
I'm sorry i have been blunt and took me so long to notice
That you don’t know how much you appreciate something until it's gone, which is this
I remember when we first started talking
You were wearing a black shirt with blue jeans, to me you were stunning
And i couldn't think of the words to say so i ended up running
To where i came from cause i thought this would never be
Because i thought you thought i was ugly
And thought you hated me
Until the end of 8th grade happened and a kid did something very bad
And it made you so sad
And made me pissed off and mad
But i helped you through it and promised i would never leave
Even if i was 80 and could only knit and weave
Without you i grieve
And wish that you would come back
Cause without you i feel like i'm on a torture rack
Cause my emotions are being burned and there's nothing i can do
Except run back to you
Begging for forgiveness, you are everything to me and something god bestowed
Without you i'm going down a long road
Wishing i could do something to have you back cause it's you and god i owe
An apology to
Kirsten you are my life and i love you
Without you i don't know how im gonna make it through
Again i know you want space but this shit hurts without you, to get you back i’ll do anything
I will get down on one leg
And beg
For you to come back with me, cause without you i feel like im seeing red
Finding my bullets made of led
Until i can finally put the 45 to my head
And you know what happens next, no i'm not gonna kill myself because of me and you
I am just trying to get my point through
It was just an expression don't worry, but i really need a genie
A lot of kids use them for a bigger weenie
Cause they don't have one, but i need a genie to make one wish
No its not to get better at rap and take over the dish
The wish is for me to have at least 5 minutes to tell you how i feel
And tell you my love for you is real
And without you i cannot get by
And without you i would rather die
( chorus)
So i better stop and say my grace
And  hope that i can win this race
Cause without you i just may
Miss you day after day
1 more time
I better stop and say my grace
And i hope i can win this race
Cause without you i just may
Miss you day after day
(verse 2)
I love you that will never change, i think about you everyday
And i'm sorry i couldn’t pull myself up and think of the right words to say
But let me tell you their is no motherfuckin way
Imma let you walk away
Your like a stingray
I'm shocked by everything you do even this, your the only one who can change me like clay
Which is what your doing so that's why i wrote this verse to lay
You can see right through me and your the only one who can do that
But the only thing you can’t see is my heart was wrestled to the mat
Held down and pinned 1-2-3
Now i'm giving my stuff away for free
Wait i don’t have anything else, only you
That's why i can’t get through
Your not like most
Your different and i love it, just not when you yell cause thats a hard roast
Your favorite color is maroon, and you love spiderman
But now that you're gone in this marathon i walked never ran
You leaving hit me hard like i was smacked with a pan
Right in the face
And my emotions kicked my ass all over the place
But i still have stuff to say to you
Just me not me and my crew
This is just me and you
There was something i never got to do
I just want to hold your hand and make you feel like the only girl that you knew
Babe now i realize i was wrong and you were right
I always over react and i know now, i found something out last night
Laying in bed knowing that you are gone, now its me in fright
I hope and pray for you to come back and stay
Cause just think of how you left, look at that way
We were in our relationship going at our own pace
Then next second we are in a room in an argument which made my heart race
Then you said you wanted space
And that made my heart drop and it felt like a cold heart punch in the face
I was a mess all over the place
With tears like a rainstorm running down my face
Just to have you back i will rip up my rap contract
Just to get you back and that's a fact
I remember all of our good times
And while my career slowly climbs
I could make those good times into a song with a thousand rhymes
So am i telling you anything new
Cause i know you think this relationship is through
But i ain't even close to being done
Do you remember we went to the movies and watched the nun?
To be honest i was so scared i wanted to run
But you went in my arms and put your head on my chest
And we kissed, and you stayed on me like you were a bird on a nest
And you told me i wasn't like the rest
I know you remember that, but without you i'm a wet fuse
Getting ready to explode and get put on the news
(chorus)
So i better say my grace
And hope i can win this race
Cause without you i may
Miss you day after day
1 more time
So i better say my grace
And hope i can win this race
Cause without you i just may
Miss you day after day
( verse 3)
I know i need to change
But telling you that is like shooting a deer at long range
It's hard to do
Because i can’t ever talk to you
Cause your always getting mad
Which always makes me sad
Maybe this relationship was never meant to be
And maybe we both should just be set free
But baby i miss you more than anyone or anything
I never told you this but your anniversary present was a ring
To prove to everyone you aren't for sale cause your mine
And you will always have me with you so when stuff goes wrong everything will be fine
And in your mind it will never be thunder and lightning cause it will only be sunshine
Remember how i said i'm sorry i couldn’t find the right words to say
Well, i just found them so i put them in another verse to lay
I love you and your all i want
But you're obviously blunt
Cause you can’t see what i see
Instead you spend your time being pissed at me
For stuff your confused about
Because of you i can’t amount
But no matter how much i love you you really don’t know what your talking about
I’ve been called a rubber band man
But everytime you yelled i couldn’t snapback
No matter what i will do anything to get you back
Cause i grew the nutsack
To stand on my own 2 feet and take control of my life
And will avert every road block and steer my life back on track no matter the strigph
And one day hopefully will make you my wife
And even if you don’t want to get back together i will still always be here for you
And will fight for you which is something you always knew
And no matter how much i can’t get through
I’ll just look at you
And you’ll always push me through
And kirsten one more time i will always love you and hope you come to your senses
And come back before your love for me rinses
Off and you find somebody new
And if you do, i'll be the way i am struggling to get through
Without you
I love you
