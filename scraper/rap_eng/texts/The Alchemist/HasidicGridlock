[Verse]
Got Purpose in a worthless universe
I'm cursed with being conceited
Smoke seeping Indian Seated
Schemes got me pacing back, forth and in circles
Could swear the tracks in the sand my Vans is dragging esoteric
Still sye my Sprites Amethyst
Spike my lines with Kool-Aid Electric
I pen with a purpose
Word contort until it's perfect
Hearse these verses
It's worth it
Could give a shit concerning earnings
Murder no mery, certain
Ho, did you eye my surname
Furher, your bitch wanna service the serpent
Swalloship, I encourage her learning
Whether she on or off the bourbon
Ain't even coerecive
Come get your girl, told her 'slow ya roll'
Best for us both, hope she don't choke up off this lamppost
In the throes of my shit
Just a toking omen, not performing
Loud strains got me scatter-brained and dormant
Soul distorted
Calm important
Leaves and frond imported, foreign
Wisdom in accordane
Hit the ground with the fugitive sprint up off porches

[Hook]
Keep The Blunt Lit
Bitch I'm prodigious
While you ball up fist
I'm taded up in my abyss
Keep the Blunt lit
Bitch I'm Prodigious
While you ball up fist
I'm taded up in my abyss
Bitch
