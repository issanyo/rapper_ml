[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Busters, I'm like Pac in Poetic Justice
Getting with the gluttony thanks to [?]
Walking off with shorty, she's sporting mom jeans
I've been that GED cat smashing prom queens
Cause that's the prime rib
Prime time to get in them ribs
I'm always in a dime's crib
Straight slay 'em when I bring my A game
It's funny how through the years we get older
But their ages stay the same, like I'm seventeen
Young, fresh, and green
Says the fiend who camped out in [?]
For kicks? Nah, just did it for kicks
You know to get my rocks off, take my socks off
Brunch with Droog, there's no emotions, just the aroma of bromhidrosis
When I brought home the hostess
Reverse Bill Cosby a hoe
After sex, she the comatosest
Blow your [?]

[Verse 2: Oh No]
All I do is serve kitchen nightmares
At restaurant like I'm cooking crack
Over a dirty ass stove wearing a crooked hat
Now look at that, sauteing the fat for the flavor
I cut the beef out with a knife sharp as a razor
It never took three judges to see that I'm the master chef
I rock a filet, the chicken's breast
I leave the pickin's for left
But I'm sick in the head so I might snatch up the rest, no rest
I bring 'em down home until the [?] leaves
Give me some dome before my needs leave
Them birds now knee deep, I am a repeat offender
I'm feeding them chocolate to make it easy
Bam! I'm on my Emeril Lagasse, and Bobby Flay
Challenging Rachel Ray, Coolio, and Flava Flav
In the backyard barbecue getting paid
Tarnish the pot with some Tanqueray
Ay...Doc No

[Verse 3: Alchemist]
Swimming in a bucket of Jenkem
Over the stove while I'm sizzling my cuts of the steak-um
Rubbing my belly like a pig but I don't fuck with the bacon
Steamrolled all over your face and leave it stuck to the pavement
Monologue Dr Zhivag' smoking dust in the basement
I'll scrape the razor
Split 'em open, discover blunts with the grape flavor
Heart pump cinnamon
You struggle with the rhythm get him a pace maker
Need I consume more than foul glutton
Snitch a kid on a whip, look like the ground hugging
The 40 cal cutting fingers on the ready to blow shit up now button
There go the crowd ducking
Walking with my hand like I'm controlling clown puppets
Gold minded digging through dirt, we found nuggets in the soil, the rubble
Then boil the foil until it bubble
Through the Toyota truck in the shuffle

[Verse 4: Fashawn]
My flow's a fiasco over a loop
Slave to the drum, holding on my noose
Shoot the soldier out his boots
They should've told you I was the truth
Goose, concealing a toaster until I shoot like
Caine in Menace, herringbone chain hang ridiculous
Bang like my days is limited
It's the same demented deranged degenerate
Inflict pain, my game is venomous
Spit out flames 'til your frame diminish
Now you holey/holy as a page of Leviticus
Niggas grind day to day for dividends
Time glutton overweight from getting it
Overseas, out of town, out of state, I'm pitching
Thought it was a roach problem how I raid the kitchen
Paid my dues, everybody paid admission
Raise the stakes, you raise suspicion
Motherfucker

[Outro: DJ Romes]
"No one can do it better"
"Gotta eat" "Bring it to 'em raw"
"Made him eat shit"
"Just don't give a..."
"Serve 'em up like gourmet dinners"
"Eat 'em up"
"Spread it out like Grey Poupon"
"Here's a ice cream cone, honey, take a lick"
"Until then, keep eating and swallowing"
"Yo, I know the perfect meal for you"
"Bite it"
