[Verse 2: Jxylen]
These death notes I wrote to damage to victims so vicious, I hope they listen so sick I need a christening tell Christ I'll send him misfits I did this, I no my minds gone I did this damn song kill niggas
To show that I'm raw, ripping tracks to tame faggots that be on my balls, and I'm so appalled no pistols whips just atom bombs, that's all equipped don't miss it Ted Bundy to all you   bitches that's on my hit-list I hinted
You pussy rappers being sensitive sentences damage you at a distance I did this on purpose, to show for certain that your rhymes and life is just as worthless, a vulture my mind Is vulgar victorious in this culture I'm gorgeous I told you fool don't fuck with me, I proceed kill niggas with CD's and mainstream
You can't see me Stevie wonder I hope you feel me, I shit feces tendencies to kill a mc, again my mind is racing I can't tame it the bass it hits the crowd goes crazy, I'm crazy I'll kill a nigga, bitch, baby
