[Verse 1]
Course he coming with the force
Enough to tear down doors
Kick you off the high horse
Fucks remorse
In some low chucks oh shucks
It's to yuck
Make the gutter blush
Flow tight as tights
On a thick bitch peep
Who it is
Locally known as low-key
More green than your grocery
Who the fuck you supposed to be
Another clone to me
The best yellow toned
On the microphone
Pissing off blacks and whites
More lines then crack head appetite
Rappers run it on a treadmill
I'ma show you how the ink feel
When I click in the pen it's the end
Break my leg turn the cast turn to peg
Pray I pump blood at 28
Dope enough to make the club
Quiet the quiet kid so who is this
How does he steer his lips in that gear
Sharp enough to pierce ears
Shoulder to cold your tears froze
Pass all tests like I jogged past Jhonny's crib
And blowing till he televised on TV
Surrounded by some CT's
The type to smack up MC's
Till EM sees another non-dark
Making a fucking spark
Did you see that new skrt parked?
At the new park gonna be gone after dark
I act good in the outside
But really good in the inside nice try
I ride waves only the best tides
Looking for a fuck to give like an ex-celibate
Light up another camel and start bumpin this
