[Intro: Max B]
Summertime shit here man
Let's do it, uh

[Chorus: Max B]
I was doing crime, barely getting by
And a nigga was always stressing
We was doing time, mama getting high
A nigga life is so depressing
Now we in need, rolling overseas
And I hope this tree don't get us arrested
We getting right, living out our life
And the music getting so refreshing

[Verse 1: Max B]
I keep the millionaires feasting
And the engineers beasting
Like Biggavel, where the fuck you been?
I can serenade in streets in my plus new Benz
Spreads the walls out let me come through them
Mama, the boy don't go cause he's thirty
He look about 21 but he at least thirty
Anything I want I can get when I need it
Chickens love slurping on my dick come and beat it
Left home without that toasty
Almost caught a slug
Go get ya camera come and quote a thug
Moms came the cops and I sold her drugs
Coke  in a cookie jar, it fizzle up something like soda does
Picture rap game without Biggavel
You fucks couldn't make it
You hot bitch come and get naked
Look like you spent a couple a bucks for his bracelet
Sizzurp in the Grand crew straight let me chase it

[Chorus: Max B]
I was doing crime, barely getting by
And a nigga was always stressing
We was doing time, mama getting high
A nigga life is so depressing
Now we in need, rolling overseas
And I hope this tree don't get us arrested
We getting right, living out our life
And the music getting so refreshing

[Verse 2: Mel Matrix]
I came along way from posting the hallway
Smoking purple while they pushing that raw yay
Mommy beefing about my cutting cards
While I am at my main crib steady cutting up the half
The D's already know my face
Cause since young comrade I've been caught my case
Back and forth to family court
And in the same court is where my family fought
Mommy screaming don't snatch my son away
But I'm thinking to myself they try snatch my guns away
Now I am off to juvie hall
But I'm built for this shit so a nigga having a ball
Got potential in this motherfucker
Eat a nigga food and wreck his dentals in this motherfucker
A nigga known for doing what he do
So when he mention my name
Niggas ain't have to say who

[Chorus: Max B]
I was doing crime, barely getting by
And a nigga was always stressing
We was doing time, mama getting high
A nigga life is so depressing
Now we in need, rolling overseas
And I hope this tree don't get us arrested
We getting right, living out our life
And the music getting so refreshing

[Verse 3: Stack Bundles]
I ain't shit
But mama first one
Poppa worst one
Had to walk the straight line
Tryna go to work from
Had a little 9 to 5
But that shit ain't work long
Needed a shortcut, had to get my money longer
A hustler was born, Rayquon was his first name
But was at a stop, whenever that first came (then what)
Then the third came (then what)
Til them birds came (damn)
Pop my cherry no longer a virg-in
Wanted to be like pops but was none of his faults
Go as hard he did and never get caught (haaaan)
I was successful, ask about them
Far Rock niggas couldn't fill them apple bags without them
Never sold a rock in my life with these hands
See it's trap records if they pull up their sleeves fam
The name Bundles
And not by coincidence
I had the trap for the scraps I'm getting in (chee)

[Chorus: Max B]
I was doing crime, barely getting by
And a nigga was always stressing
We was doing time, mama getting high
A nigga life is so depressing
Now we in need, rolling overseas
And I hope this tree don't get us arrested
We getting right, living out our life
And the music getting so refreshing
