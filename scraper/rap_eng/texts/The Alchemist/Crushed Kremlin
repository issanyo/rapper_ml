[Verse 1: Meyhem Lauren]
Steak and peppers, 4X Polo leathers
We bag bird bitches ruffle feathers, let 'em dead us
We ain't want 'em anyway, that's the game plan
Switch 'em up with Bronsinelli, that's my main man
Move vigorous, sharp smooth scissorish
Sipping on the VSOP ock, smooth privilege
QU lineage, see through fake images
I do this winning shit my progress is limitless
Incinerate dreams just by living
Pass the mothafuckin' gravy, everyday is Thanksgiving
Skanks driven quite often in my ride
Got a good girl on lock but keep some bad ones on the side
Stuck in my ways, hustling for days
Don't give a fuck about a war let's start chucking grenades
I got bags under my eyes, keep 'em tucked under shades
Gold chains and brand names keep 'em stuck in a daze, I'm out
