Yeah yeah yeah okay
I intro the other side of the hundo
Look out for me at the outro giving counsel
And wandered down a mountain with a mouthful of powerful symbols
The spit to shower the sinful
To make the powerful simple
And chained and collared the cowards to build a tower for kinfolk
Oh shit is that the cycle?
Is that the never-ending spiral that oscillate 'tween deceitful and disciple?
It seems that I cracked the cipher 'tween the peaceful and the psycho
As sure as the pendulum swinging
I exit the telephone booth with my em-b-lem blinging
And everything got a ring to it
And way more likely to ig you than getting into it
Meanwhile i be building a igloo like I'm a inuit
Here's your golden ticket to catch my solo at the symphony of the infinite
Forgive but not forget
To tighten up the grip
And live without regret
Yep

Bad folks try to spook em like oops spagett
They been plotting on a coo, but can't coo percent
Stay gunning for the brothers like Koopa's camp
Ride a wolf into battle then ring the mech mech
Pull up hop in the chest and I flee the set
To your man dem take turn you to eager fam
Took a trip to visit my ego he told me y'all changed
We spoke of where I was headed and from where he came
But each inners only beginning what will end the same scene
Good deeds done under liege of evil man
The spook will sat by the suit and co-deed his plan
The ma ma Malcolms ma Martins and Smileys selling the portraits
Ignore that call on the web via rap and spin
Can happen quicker than you quit what's happenin'
That ebb and flow ain't no hold that's a fact my friend
It all comes backs where it started that pendulum swing
SWING

Actually, I think you'll be surprised, because there are more sort of things that go though periodic motion than you realize, because that's what a pendulum does right?

The marvelous property of the pendulum is that is makes all of its vibrations, large or small, in equal times

Fallen leads to the snow
Well here's to the learn
Learn leads to the know
Know leads to the unknown
That takes you back to the growth
War leads to more war
Peace peace to the peace
Day turns into night
Night turns every peace
Snow is to the shallows
Shallows made for the growth
Growth is for the fallen
Falling leads to the snow
Grow leads to the mire
Mire leads to the know
Know produce the unknown
That takes you back to the grow
War leads to more war
Peace peace for the peace
Day turns into night
Rinse, rather, repeat
