I was right there, I was right there. Now see, these places that are really, really filthy and really hard to find. Right there in that corner
That's not even a cleaning issue, that's a, that's a "I don't care" issue. God knows what's growing behind there. It's some really nasty, disgusting filth. It's been explained to me several times that I need to understand how filthy this is. This is the area that you would stand. Then you would come over here, you know, might get herpes or syphilis or God knows what growing in there. Take home that, spread in your house, spread with your family, share with your friends [?]
