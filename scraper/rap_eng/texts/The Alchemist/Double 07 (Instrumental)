You should be rolling up by now

Shelter from the rain in a parked car
Chopping game, modifying my slangs
Fog lights in the grill, in the grill whipping the 96 [?]
[?]
My independence remain cause I ain't working for the radio station like Martin Payne
I grind and maintain my peace of mind almost lost it once on the line
Too see that I found it just in time, a mercenary killer
Paid for bringing death to these wack niggas
You call them raps that's why them labels never called you back
Pimpin, yea jack, spitta snap, long flight, turbulence bad
Baggage claim tags car service rolling grass Double 07
But I ain't talking agents, 2 ounces and 7 grams my nigga we still blazing
You uneasy in my presence, dumb questions, dumb statements
I'm on a whole other level roof terrace you the basement
Couldn't gain possession them haters couldn't take it
Can't see me unless you sleeping nigga Freddy vs Jason
Snoozing on a JET movement, the worst nightmare in the making
