[Eminem]
Yo blast me off, Tim, blast me off, son
Blastin' off right now son

PART ONE

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wasn't born mean, I was pushed to treachery
I walk the streets looking for some puss to fetch me
I'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't gimme Kim, things could get messy
So pass that ass to me let me squish the left cheek
And press against the right one till it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods, the MC
With the Christopher Reeve beef
We started out on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg made outta wood
I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood, I'm chillin' with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like Jell-O
I'm like hello to a cute little dyke on the mic
I'm kinda like Iron Mike 'cause I bite earlobes

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
See I'm the first one to class and the last to leave
I mean the first one to leave outta class, believe
That I'm a mailbox pimp in my heart till I die
Even after I’m all gone and my ashes fried
Went from an ashy guy class clown as high
To a grown ass man stacking pa-per
Runyon Ave.'s the clique , D12's the game
We've been spitting this (shit)
Since we were little bébés
Gaga goo goo nana, nadi do do never
Word to my homie Em, I'm just too too clever
A 4-5 shot and leave a nigga's face  lop-sided
The kick from the barrel make you think I'm cock-eyed it
When I bust it out off in the crowd, you start diving
Greg Louganis went over the bar I ain't lying
Hot Iron lethals not defying a soldier
Runyon Ave. soldier equals death when it's over
It's none colder than (a nigga) understand the struggle
Apply the street-muscle we've been had to hustle
We've been had to hustle, we've been had to muscle
Apply the street hustle, we've been had to hustle

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Aight, aight
Me and Westwood blastin' off, jackin' off
In a pair of acid washed bumpin' Asher Roth
Cruisin Gratiot til I damn near crash the car
Tryna smash 'em off in the dash, hit the overpass, went off
Over the bridge into oncoming traffic
Caused a massive forty-two car pile-up, not a scratch at all
Hopped up holding an axe and saw
Jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tabasco sauce
Spitting flames, kickin' fire out your ass you little bastard
You can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdrawal
Dick so big it's like elastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of Plastic Man with a drastic force
And went spastic, put my penis on classic sports

PART TWO

[Eminem]
Once again it's the sinister, cynical, minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administer of the pain, just finished, huffing the paint
And muffled the fumes like it was nothing because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he spray, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares making the hairs
All on the back of your neck stand
Like Dracula yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yah, Angela so I command you to start dancing
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, ya gangsta, my ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facing a task greater, he's chasing your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table
I'm checking the exposure, a full dose of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off overdosing
Windows opening-shutting, doors opening-closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and Codeine
I was only supposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink frozen
Myself, self-loathing, 'cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think this will make everything rosey
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in, I'm yodelling
Rosey, won't you come out to play
A nuisance, wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put neurofens in my syrup and stirred em
You never heard him like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies 'cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events and then he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured em into the building and killed em
Buried em in the mulch and mildew and he will
Do what he feels and still can spin
Straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol - three pills, the Real Slim
Shady's entered the building
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and
Tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid
He's ill wit it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, MC's
Will get fricasseed on the grill then

PART THREE

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You wanna start with the hook first
You wanna start with the...oh
I have no idea what I'm doing, I have no idea what I'm doing, but
Everybody get up, sit up Christopher
They're miserable without you, Superman is a-
Live and he's flowin' like the Mystic River
Girl, don't act like you've never been kissed before
One, two, three, four, five, six, this uh
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody ever find me? I disa-
-ppeared, I was hiding in Freeway's beard, just a
Hop, skip and a jump from my skin gushing
Nails into my face that I been pushing
Hellraiser, my face is my pin cushion
It's like when I'm on the mic I can squish a
Sucker like a vice grip, my pen put you
In the slaughterhouse 'cause your style's been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on, my brains on
Hyperdrive, someone put the brakes on

[Hook: Eminem and Mr. Porter]
Here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
Now here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
I got it figured out now nigga, see
My mind's right, money right
Can't nobody stoppin' how I get it
In hindsight I never shoulda left where  I was livin'
I probably wouldn't be getting pressed by all these women
But then again I wouldn't 'a met the ones that I was diggin'
So now I like to look and talk a lot like
She like Lil Kim and Kim and Serena Williams
Just like my [ ] I'm a regular Charles Dickens
Bitch call me talking about she pregnant
She crazy so I [ ] that ho and left baby
I won't never trust her no shit
Even if she specialize in mouth massaging my testicles
I never trust her, a ho, I, even on the first date
She's basically getting her mouth raped
Then turn around and ask me for a kiss
"No bitch I'm straight"
I've never really been concerned with how my own dick taste

I think I'm about slip on my swag juice, swag juice
I think I'm about to slip on your swag juice

[Eminem]

Oh no! Don't slip on your swag juice!

[Mr. Porter]

Yeah, yeah, I think I'm 'bout to slip on my swag juice!

[Hook: Eminem and Mr. Porter]
So here's a smidge and a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to figit with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice.  Aright

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Slim is in the house, simmer down there sister
Bound to get you dizzy 'cause he gets as busy as a
Bee baby you could throw a Frisbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he, he's a wizard
Standing in the disco with a disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquick, is it
Now baby don't forget to bring your lipstick witcha
I want the kiss before I blow this bitch to smitha-
Reens, get the guillotines, this is a situ-
Ation that's critical as Dre spins his, uh
Turn tables and he cuts the record like a scissor
Checka-chicky-checka-chicky-checka-checka-chicka
We'll wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just to make a little breakfast and it's six o-
Clock in the morning unless you want to get some dessert

[Hook: Eminem and Mr. Porter]
Here's a smidge and a midget to get your Bridgets, digit
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I said, here's a smidge and a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag, my swag juice

[Epilogue: Eminem]
Ayo, just so everybody knows, that was a hook we made on the way to the radio station and we were trying to get it right;
So we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever;
But, this is what we were trying to like work out before we came here. Especially for Westwood, man! ESPECIALLY for you homie!
