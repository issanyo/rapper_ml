[Verse 1: Boldy James]

I nicknamed everythang; Nicknamed Moochie
My dank Mary Jane and my big chain juley
A deuce is a split, a baby is stuey
A kilo is a Brick, a quarter is a cutie
If you telling, you a Snitch, County is the Skidooski
A Sentence is a bit, and Prison is the Hoopski
A Shooter is a Goonie, Flick is a whole clip
On some Motion Picture shit, take you to see a Movie
A Square is a Loosey, a Pistol is a Throwaway
On a good day, ay, you can call me Juicy J
You a fake nigga, U.S.P.A. Polo with two men on a horse
That mean you niggas gay
I call my wife Sunshine cuz when I'm feeling gray
Like my son eyes, She always brighten up my day
I'm from the darkside; I call it The Dead Giveaway
Gotta be alert at all times, Triple A

[Hook: Boldy James]
Nicknamed Moochie. Nicknamed Moochie
I nicknamed everythang, nicknamed Moochie

(Yo, Check me out)

[Verse 2: Boldy James]

Me, I'm a Concreature, I call guns Heaters
AK is the Chopper, I call my nine "Nina"
And my Glock, E-40 and the Click
Errol Flynn'in in the spot, like Detroit, we in this bitch
What up tho? Going hand to hand is hustlin'
And of course, a Grand is a Band of Brothers
I call acting brand new 'Frontin'', bitch please
Really, all i need is pussy, weed, liquor, brand new money
And my Revolver. Call it my Mag
If a bitch still walkin', i call her a Strag
When i got the bird in, they callin 'em slabs
When i got the work in, I call it the bag?
Shit niggas stole from me, they callin' it 'Swag'
That's a different kinda person, we call 'em a fag
I Fucked my Money Up, spent all of my cash
At the bar still splurging, they call it a Tab
