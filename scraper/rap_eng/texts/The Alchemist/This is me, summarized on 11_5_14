I’m not a misogynist; I am pro-Gamer Gate
I am pro-feminist, Tumblr needs to fade away
I’m a skateboarder on a Nascar straightaway
I don’t have a lane, so I’ll get down and pave a way
I’m a virgin that will approach sex mechanically ‘cause when I get passionate, the world can never handle me
Get your nut; I’ma save mine ‘til the winter
I’m a stage five pro, clinging to the title “beginner”
Yes, I’m a master, I don’t wanna to prove it
I reluctantly act stupid, I don’t make black music
I’m not Mike Brown, I’m no less susceptible
I’m not Raven-Symone; I loiter in your vestibule
Non-threatening songs blaring out of my Beats
Crushing on white girls while enjoying Keke Palmer’s leaked nudes
I am not a sweet dude, I am not a monster
I’m a grey blob that may or may not have a sponsor
God-fearing agnostic in an ideology mosh pit
Ahh shit; I’m a rapper… with a conscious
