(Voice singing) "Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang."

[Big Noyd: Verse 1]

Alchemist, This is it kid !
Yo , they can't fuck with the boy Noyd
I'm ill, i'm to real, they don't know what beef is
These niggas better chill. See, i'm cool
Unless I had to merk somethin',then thats
When I (Shoot em' up),and murder them man
I shut they eyelids from violence
Nigga you see you wylin
Your team against, My team
It ain't no challenge
Niggas know we mobbin'
Rollin' in thousands
Man we would ( Shoot em' up )
And leave they ass silent
The word , you the herb niggas clownin'
Polishin' they knuckle game, bashin' your mouth in
Thought you was thuggin'  but now nigga you front-ing, screamin',You were donned all along , this nigga not a thing
It's on now , see his ass in the street,out come the guns
Know the thuns , man we gotta eat. QB nigga
An we don't give A fuck who want beef
We don't care about your car nigga,see we got heat
We don't care about your broads nigga,see we love the street
Front, Get your ass lumped, nigga-- it be our treat
G'head we don't front in them streets
When it come to that beef,You know we ( Shoot em' up )
An leave em' dead on the concrete
Need more heat for more beef , more thuns
We more deep, More guns, on more streets
The beef on- it's no sleep, Just more heat for police
Check the guns we squeezin'  when we (Shoot em' up)
We leave em' buried in a three piece suit
Come on duke , you know my gun shoot
Niggas know my name
Niggas know my gun bang-bang
Niggas know what time it is
Niggas know my style kid
Niggas know I rep the bridge..

[Big Noyd: Hook]

C'mon!
Niggas screaming they hood
But out side of they hood they nothin'
Niggas never (Bang Bang)--
Nah, niggas screaming they hood
I run up in they hood and (Shoot em' up)
An this is how we do it man
Niggas screaming they hood, but outside of
They hood they nothin', niggas never (Bang Bang)
Niggas screaming they hood- I run up in they hood
An (sound of gun cocked, and shots being fired)
Bang , Bang


[Big Noyd: Verse 2]

Ayo,niggas don't want it, If they want it then they get it
See I talk cause I live it & I walk with a mean limp
Know what I mean king? the thing on my hip, gotta mean
Kick- An I don't be without it. Look- I'm the next best
Gat slangin, rap singin' nigga outta Queensbridge, an I
Don't be playin with dem meanors.I'm more into drama-bringin
Have you in dirt while your mama in church with her choir singin
Step out your zone you get blown open leakin'
Nigga I'm terror like a squad full of Puerto Ricans
Insomniac with drama nigga , there's no sleeping
I got nickel plated revolvers for that reason
See-- I been puffin' blunts and I'm high
But bet I'm on point, boy, i'll punch you in yo eye
Cause every time they tell me put my gun away
I tell em- '"yeah right" Boy , I'll (shoot em' up)
Cause I ain't tryna fight, an I ain't dyin' tonight
I'm trying to scoop me some boots,an wear em out until
They worn out, that's right,and anything else is just uncivilized
I (shoot em' up) trying to couple up with the cutie pies
