Lose your life

Yeah, what up? Snoopie D-O Dub
West coast kings, what's up, Alchemist?
I wanna holla real quick, man
'Cause see a lota these niggas got the game
Fucked up, man, they don't know, man
It's real seriously, it's heavy out in those streets, man
You could lose your like that

You wanna lose your life
Play me, got a pocket and mah cock it and you might
You wanna lose your life
Niggas getting dropped and popped on the block every night

You wanna lose your life
Money is the key in the street life
You wanna lose your life
Walking 'round gang banging betta keep that thang hanging

20 lil missiles in the clip of the 5-7
I'm like navigation if you trying to find heaven
You already know I'm a rare breed
Sitting on a nice amount of acres and square feet

Yeah, see even the best die respect my
Colombian neck tie, you just can't pass death by
You can be homie 'cause neutral god body, neita, king Zulu

One thing about death it ain't gonna fool you
No reason to lie for nothing to prove too
Why you still here? Though the devil will use you
Closed casket is how I know the bullets abused you

Even though I'm a boss I like to eat food too
Spray a nigga block up when I'm in the mood too
Blow a blunt get a drink whatever soothes you
'Cause if it ain't the street the system will lose you

You wanna lose your life
Play me got a pocket and mah cock it and you might
You wanna lose your life
Niggas getting dropped and popped on the block every nightt

You wanna lose your life
Money is the key in the street life
You wanna lose your life
Walking 'round gang banging betta keep that thang hanging

Homie, listen to the flow let it take you where you're going
Billy Jean step over the track till it's glowing
You thinking I'm the O N E metaphors are no win
Avalanche P pushed powder till you snowed in

Open sesame unveil the recipe cocaine cook up, heroin and ecstasy
Got me locked in the coupe like the lambos arresting me
Gun play necessity war fare, none spared
Duffel bag money ain't all there we sick 'em all morning victim

He who test P just begging for the death walk with devilish me
Sit back kick back knowing that there's none hotter
Graduated from a drug dealer's alma-mater
Magna cum lauder, the kitchen I'm so jada
You niggas got no worries, hakuna matata

You wanna lose your life
Play me got a pocket and mah cock it and you might
You wanna lose your life
Niggas getting dropped and popped on the block every night

You wanna lose your life
Money is the key in the street life
You wanna lose your life
Walking 'round gang banging betta keep that thang hanging

[Incomprehensible]
Niggas getting dropped and popped on the block every night
Chemical warfare
