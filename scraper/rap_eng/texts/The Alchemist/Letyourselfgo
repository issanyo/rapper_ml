[Intro: Evidence]
Oh no
{A-A-A-Al-Al-Al-Al-Alchemist}
You gotta let this breathe for a minute
Just let it breathe

[Verse 1: Evidence]
There's a reason why my friends did cocaine
I sat home at night tryna get my beats pro game
Slow and low, what happened was this
I stayed on my grind
And everything else became last on my list
Let my birds go, go 'head, fly away
The ones that don't come back ain't meant to be caged
It's a brand new day, I'm a brand new me
Change the number on my cell and on a brand new street
I don't wanna keep in touch, I just wanna start fresh
And ain't afraid to die but still got a little left to give
This, Evidence Alchemist hits
Live and direct, no price tag could cover the trip
Shit is the truth and this is undisputable proof
So understand where we stand in negotiating loot
Right now you got the two best chefs who got the recipe
This the main course, the weed sold separately

[Hook: Phonte]
Ayo, I'm all about elevating
I'm on the grind tryin' to get mine instead of waiting
So why you hesitating?
Letyourselfgo, letyourselfgo
Letyourselfgo, letyourselfgo
If you ain't got a plan, then you are not a man
If you ain't hustling then we gon' have a problem, fam
Letyourselfgo, letyourselfgo
Letyourselfgo, letyourselfgo

[Verse 2: The Alchemist]
It's the rhythm jackin', honey slappin', long money bums
I come from Cali 'cause that's where I'm from
It's the pocket, I'm sitting on top of the snare drum
Full circle, now I'm right back to square one
Some rappers had the game in a smash now they're done
It's crazy how they go just as fast as they come
We were little kids, writing raps, just tryna have fun
Kickin' punchlines and banging on the table at lunchtime
Now it's the field of rap that got us all on the frontline
Used to get butterflies in my stomach before showtime
But now I just stand and deliver it
'Cause Beni said always make better and bigger shit (ABB)
I'm just perfecting it, I'm not the one who invented it
All this money I'm spending it, not the person who printed it
The money never motivate, it's just an incent-ti-tive
You trying to get it like that, your options are limited

[Hook: Phonte]
Ayo, I'm all about elevating
I'm on the grind tryin' to get mine instead of waiting
So why you hesitating?
Letyourselfgo, letyourselfgo
Letyourselfgo, letyourselfgo
If you ain't got a plan, then you are not a man
It's Evidence, ALC, we got a problem, fam
Letyourselfgo, letyourselfgo
Letyourselfgo, letyourselfgo

[Outro: Evidence + Phonte]
Uh, Phontiga, Evidence, and ALC, most definitely
We keep it We keep it, we run it, we run it
We do it, we do it, we gun it, we gun it
My nigga Evidence, what up?
What up, what up? It's the Weatherman, landing in your area
Who said it doesn't rain in Southern California, man? They crazy
Staying on my grind
