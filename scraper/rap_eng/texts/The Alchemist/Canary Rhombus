[Intro: Hus Kingpin]
You had to do coke with me
Wavo

[Verse 1: Hus Kingpin]
My gun sharp it shoot like Bret Hart
It's Wavo the wave goat
A flash back to my mink
Wavy as cocaine drip
On my sabbatical I wrote this off two acid tablets
I need Hennessy not Codeine
Talk cheese I shred Gouda
Chinese algebra my alpha
And Angola
I need a bitch from Ghana, Trinidadian bitch that cook Channa
I like a little Chamomile in my ? tea
Y'all niggas Usher with the fat bitch she humpty
It's Mach-Hommy and Lord Wavy
Xan sex off a crushed Xanax
This is stellar's working
Your bitch pussy squirt like stars merchant
It's Wavo, I'm just swerving
When I drop my new shit it's Broadway curtains
Waved up on La Brea
Fly Braveheart wave art

Yeah everything wavy son
Everything palm trees everything Parmesan
It's Mach-Homicide and Lord Wavy

[Verse 2: Mach-Hommy]
We out here niggas is in the mirror
Fuck you twistin' up your face for sit still
Jump in the chair
I can make a nigga play or just chill, like sincere
Listen my nigga here
Maybe I oughta disappear
Get rid of that thing thing
D's gonna want to talk if that nigga live
Maybe I saw it in a flick
You ain't never been blamed for a chainsaw choppin'
I wasn't even there
I was way over town
Eating Kung-Pao lotus root go ahead hold it down
I'm a shred on the ground
Where I'm from might throw you for a loop
Prayers on the loud
I got ten on the loud
On some Wolf Gang Kill Them All shit
Dead on arrival
I got hands on the bible
Amadeus with the keys sound like
[They?] dance when I hobble

[Outro: Mach-Hommy]
Canary in the mind
Canary in the mind
If it goes in yellow and when it comes out black
You know it's buried in the mind
Canary in the mind
Canary in the mind
If it goes in yellow and when it comes out black
You know it's buried in the mind
Canary in the mind
