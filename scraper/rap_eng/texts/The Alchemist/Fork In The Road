(Verse 1)
They say I'm an asshole... I guess they kinda right
Only bad things seem to happen when you try do right
Maybe you sleepin, gotta hurt you for a sign of life
I'd slap the shit out you but I'm busy here trying to write

The only reason I'd been fiending for that china white
Is I'm hungry, I shouldn't even be eatin' at this time of night
I'm being honest, he is pompous but he shine the light
Everyone is scared of the truth, but what you trying to hide

Budget is off, and suffered a loss
Anything can be a write off, Its company cost
How you build a foundation when the structure is off
Bring in people who won't say nothing when something is wrong

Tryin to win is useless, showing liars what the truth is
Its all about perspective plus your mind is rendered useless
I short cuircuit, I'm wired to get the booth lit
It's poppin like a loose hip and they dying to see me lose this

Hook X 2:
I hate battle theres noone to compete with
I hate life, so many had it stolen from beneath them
And most listeners are only into free shit
I guess the fork in the road is what im sposed to eat it

(Verse 2)
It means less when I write it on paper
A little more when I say it, it make perpect sense later
I ain't sayin' that I'm Nostradamus, or the next Dali Lama
Or it was written with nas's consicence, on some I am God shit

They thinking violent options
Try and rob em, try and pop em
Too high to stop em, afterlife be in a flying coffin'

Listeners are fiends, and they fixin for a new fix
Should be rich by now and sittin in a huge whip
Blue '6-4 like Eazy - E , Ruthless (roofless)
Enough loot to alter the future on my Suge shit

You watch your back, even wit people that crew with
Say the truth just for kicks they just walk away if shoe fits
Getting confused like a slave on a cruise ship
The icing on the cake is that you think that it's a cool whip
