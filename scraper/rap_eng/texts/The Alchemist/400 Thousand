[Verse 1]
You can't have no friends in real life
When all you do is bag up grams and sell white
Gotta find some way to stash these bands
And hide this cash
If they trip over my stash they set for life
I recognize it's hard to get it and keep it
Easy to jeopardize
Risk ain't worth the reward, pay it no never mind
Take it in stride and if worse comes to worst
You always board your first, never your second mind
Mind your business and never mix business with friendship
Cause friends be the ones in the end when it's all said and done
Who can you call? Who can you run to?
Will they come through on the humble?
Or will they drop the ball and fumble
I wouldn't be surprised
I've seen it all out my own two eyes
Before he died my uncle
Said, "if you let it slide it'll come back to haunt you"

400 thousand
I got all of this money and can't trust a soul to help me count this
400 thousand
Now the kush and the bricks got me pushing whips that ain't even out yet
400 thousand
Know how you know you getting money when you spend a thousand dollars on an outfit
400 thousand
I got all of this money and can't trust a soul to help me count this
400 thousand

[Verse 2]
My son asked what's the most money I ever counted
I told him 'bout $460,000
All dope money from whipping ounces
Slow rolling them snow bunnies in Clinton Township
The bastards tried to give me 'bout six
For transacting them graham crackers of that brown shit
Had me surrounded
They jammed traffic, the vans in back of them Crown Vics
But they never found shit
During the fed run-ins, out in southwest
Used to have to get plugged into the outlet
Bagging up in the house, stressed, ask Justin
Man, I used to have nothing, but now I'm rich
No more out of town trips, jumping on the road
No change of clothes, same old outfit
In the natty we hit the outlet
What I blew on vintage True Religion denim could've bought a couch set

[Hook]
