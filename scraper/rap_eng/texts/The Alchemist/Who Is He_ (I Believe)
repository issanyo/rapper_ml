[Verse:]
The reason you lift your hands is because you already believe
You’re saying “I believe” [x2]
Everybody’s got to know who Jesus is
Who Jesus is
Everybody’s got to know (they’re crying)
Who Jesus is
Don’t you think they ought to know?
Who Jesus is
The thing that holds me back
The thing that holds me back from making a real connection to Jesus Christ
Is all the questions I have about the guy
I’m young, most of my life is still ahead of me
If I make Jesus everything in my life
It’d be like giving him a…a blank cheque
I’d like to see it filled in first
I mean… I think I can change it
The reason you lift your head is because you already believe
You’re saying I believe, you know
And we’re just giving you the opportunity to confess
And before a man who sees you a little guy in the back
Little guy, i mean not a midget he’s a, he’s a child
I mean… I wouldn’t want anyone to think I was offending a midget
