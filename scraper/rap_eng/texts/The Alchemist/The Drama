Fuck you thought?
Fuck ya'll thought?

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Ayo, first off, fuck these niggas that think it's sweet
I fucked their bitches, it's P
You know that nigga, that spit that Mobb Deep, gangsta shit
Got all kinds of beef, niggas want me hit
But it's not going down like that, because I
Can't let it go, won't let it, no
Guns I let them blow, niggas get fold
It's like clockwork, schooling these niggas how the Glocks work
Show no fear, protect my wig, it's like field day
I'm planting my flag
Can't stop, P once he squeezing that Mac
Can't stop death, there's no coming back
But I respect your hustle dunn you tried your best
But for right, now, in pieces you will rest

[Hook x2]
The drama, we with that dig
The drama, we bury that shit
The drama, with me it's crazy guns pop, dunns drop
Razor chops, basically

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Basically it's no comp, niggas get stomped out
So ill, your blood fuck my sneakers up dunn
Ew, fuck them shits, I'll buy some new kicks
You need a new face though
Ya'll know the ratio, when it comes to that thumping
Ya'll niggas losing every round though
That's right, and I don't stop until them si-reens
Be screaming up the blocks, and I murk off
I'm outta here dunn
I'm choking off green, you chocking on blood
I'm sitting back, leaning, you laying down fucked up
Tough luck, and if you come it be worse
And I don't lie, well tell stories
When the truth gonna reveal itself eventually, they'll test me
Let's , see, how many lits for gun it'll be

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Ayo, niggas hating, me
Because I blatantly don't give, a fuck
Dunn my shit is major league
You can't fake P, I'm a motherfucking menace
Your woman got eyes for me, she getting with it
She threw it at me, so I hit it
She gets wet, like the pool when I'm in it
And I dive all in it, know you hate to hear that
Hurts dwelling on that, and now you want to flip

[Verse 4: Twin Gambino]
You talk alot of, shit
Niggas don't want it with this four, fifth
I got an extra clip for your man, so he ran
Top speed into a pole, and broke his nose
Niggas be shook like that
Because you know the history of the first infantry
How we used wet the spot with the black fully
As a youngin', a bully
Niggas didn't want it, we stay blunted
Eyes, the color of blood
We got respect in the hood, that's why the wolves show us love
We bugged, a little bit, when it's on and shit
Rest in peace to my niggas that be talking shit
Word up...
