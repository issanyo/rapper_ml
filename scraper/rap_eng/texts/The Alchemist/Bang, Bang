[Intro]
Bang, bang, nigga, fuck that
I know niggas ain't poppin' shit
Word up, 101, whatever, I'll fuck these niggas up
Put the guns down, this is Jada
Whatever niggas want do, J-A-D-A
Y'all 'ready know, LOX, what, nigga?

[Hook]
We gon' thug this shit out, we gon' thug this shit out
And say, 'Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang'

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah, throw your sets up, niggas, bang, bang
Gangbang, whatever you got to to maintain
Real talk, reason they lovin' me ain't changed
It's like stickin' a pit bull on a Great Dane
Besides walkin' 'round here shooky, you straight lane
Good dope got fiends lookin' for straight veins
The fire in my eye, you lookin' at straight flames
What you feelin' is that guilt, it ain't shame
Servin' niggas just ain't built to take pain
It take a certain special skill to bang, bang
Yeah, I could stand there and just look at your brains hang
We're from a different world, my nigga, the Dwayne Wayne
We in the same race, not in the same lane
It's all the same base, was hoppin' the same train
Used the same plates for choppin' the same 'caine
Yeah, no security, I'm poppin' the thang-thang
When are you gonna realize he's not playin'?
With extortion, dudes got killed, they stopped payin'
Stay low-key firin', don't stop sprayin'
Niggas is eyeballin' now and they stop weighin'
All I know is, have that money by the A.M
Or else they gon' hit him soon as I okay him
Yeah, I'm still killin' these bitches, I O. J. 'em
Shout the rock, see gutter, the whole (-)
I'm always gone, at shows I'm not stayin'
I'm one of the elite, that goes without sayin'
I'm on a roll, doin' shows or I'm layin'
We don't love them hoes, we Bombay 'em
Show me the target, set it, I'm aimin'
Whatever the odds are, bet it, I'm gamin'
Yeah, shittin' on all these niggas, I'm not strainin'
Know how it feels to get wet without rainin'
Nobody loves you yet, you're not Raymond
The lion inside me, yes, I tamed him
I took the other route, I bring the gang to your mother house
Bang, bang, we gon' thug it out
