[Prevail]
I'm posted in the brightest colors available
A bright neon sign that says all MC's alienable
My shiftings is unscalable
Take key to the contouring shape of the dagger in my cape
Four fifty one, right hand circle and circle weight
I be ablaze to take position as a leader of the mission
To expose the fall the handplay of filthy composed magicians
There's been objectings to the way that I present my name's sake
Too broad for some horizons when I rise like landscape

(Chorus)
[Madchild]
Follow my lead and walk towards the light
It is I who encompasses doom consuming fright
[Prevail]
I'm bad, my nickname is a circuit breaker
Eating up the world acre by acre

[Madchild]
Rock star reflections scalping a diamond destiny
Dynasty of the slanted crushed black velvet and safire
Psycho circuits of carnage that's unbelievably evil
Blood trickling temper of pure golden retriever
I'm inspired by the sun, envision orange and purple
Mental games of enslavement strengthen the sacred circle
And lengthen mystic adventure, I ride path of destruction
Mysterious elves now cringed of my introduction
I'm Madchild new king of scalp crushing confusion
Demons dress to kill but it's an optical illusion
This is an invasion of purified creation
I'm star gazing blazing infernal of fear
In the third dimension among the living it's quite clear
(Which way did he go?) I'm right here
Master of my universe gaurdian of our galaxy
The fallacy annihilates It's I of course
I'll rip, with the hippest trip wire force
Twentieth century trojans in an iron horse
I endorse myself as a dope product don't get caught up
In the web, of the wicked killer spider you'll get swallowed

(Repeat chorus) 2X

[Prevail]
Imagine the venom in my jaw
When it drives your body into recall
Cause sooner or later then hangman will call
And I'll be right there with him, black suit and all
So you made ?humafisto? and hexagons a crystal
When he arrives at your doorstep with money by the fistful

(Repeat chorus) 2X
