Yeah, hey, looka here
Let’s be getting’ ready to get down
With some business

Verse 1
First I grab a number 2
And then I hit the loose leaf
If you got beef with my crew

(??) a couple (dogs? Docs?) for protection
Intersection  of the friends psych-a-men
Still flexin’ my bicep

So why step
If you ain’t legitski
Then my car (???)
Park that shit

(???) left foot
The six to the third degree
That’s word have you heard of me?

I don’t pack no steel just to play the road
But I’ll be paying a toll, so the steel steal my soul
Yo that’s just like repasta riss
So when them Hostages, take my train rearrange, get cained

So I never get a half step
Or gain territory just to ruin my rep
Crept once but now I gotta stand up
Drop my rhyme book your silly crick & put your hands up



Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick em up

Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick em up

Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick em up

Run your park because you can’t run quick enough


Put your hands up reach for the sky
On the field with the whooligan skill
I got mad style, I get buck wild
On the DL with the low profile

Swing as I just do my thing
Dip dap the clash when the bell ring
Don’t got a gang but I got my crew
What you wanna do if you wanna to step to

The whooliganz step aside as I kick it
One of these other skills is the ticket
I think I’m going mad
Coulda been bad
With the rough time I’ve had

Pants are sagging
Everyone’s ragging
But I got (???)
If you think I’m lagging

Got a stand up when I roll with the vodka
Reach for the sky and put your hands up

Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick em up

Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick em up

Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick em up

Run your park because you can’t run quick enough

Just throw your hands in the air
Just throw your hands in the air
Just throw your hands in the air
Just throw your hands in the air

Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Give me all your money

When I get scandalous
I handle this situation
By placing my trusty pal
Trust me now we out to hear the new beat
Conmmensce the greetings and let the meetings be brief
Then I hop back in an automobile
Hide my steel because I got a raw deal
Nowadays I gotta be hard and I don’t wanna be
Tell you how it’s gotta be

Ain't no fuss so just listen
Check out my pearly whites glisten
Cause you tickle me pink
With your half assed mission
Wishin’ a part from a star in particularly, a idol
Eliminating fame from your title
I write a line, insult your whole game plan
Case your main plan is like unsatisfactory
One that is fact that remain
Is just a replica to real
And put your hands up on the steel

Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick ‘em up

Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick ‘em up

Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick ‘em up

Run your park because you didn’t run quick enough


Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick em up

Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick em up

Put your hands up
Put ‘em up stick em up

Run your park because you didn’t run quick enough
