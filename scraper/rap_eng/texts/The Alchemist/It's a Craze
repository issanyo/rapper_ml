"Everybody love it, it's a craze"
"Everybody love it..."

[Verse 1: Havoc]
That real street shit when it's from the heart
Don't be going talking out your ass, you'll get torn apart
Separated like a foster kid, metal will spark
People tell the difference from our styles like fine art
Never share my plans with a hoe, know how bitches talk
Where we digging your grave, body surrounded by white chalk
Get a load of these cowards, you know he frontin'
While his heart is smaller then the 50 bags that we dumping
And vanilla dutch is my click, ain't nothing to fuck with
My pipe remind these bitches of guns that I be busting
Lay 'em out, sippin' the Stout, swallowing V is nothing
I'm a G but with an O in the front, I ain't a youngin'
I'm a grown ass man, the pound is like a pops
Grounding you little fucks, wetting your Tonka truck
You better get armored up; if it's drama, we follow up
Me without the guns? You crazier than a jar of dust, muthafuckas

"It's a craze...everybody love it..."

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Ayo, It's like a fresh air, just take it all in
God damn, it feel good when I hear this shit
Reminds me of my gun, reminds me of death
Just when you think everything's good, that's when everything flips
Bullets take a second hit, it happened so quick
And everything stops right there ... that's it
All we know it's the sad parts and foul endings
We ain't planning on living long, just getting long money while we living
Looks like it's getting hot now, fellows
Time to step it up a few more notches with our self, meaning
It's no playing at all, it's no sleep
It's not a song we can't top, it's not a problem for us to do these
It be all stuck tryna squeeze
Their brain but they still can't fuck with Mobb Deep
(Yo, what's the word?) You ain't heard, we done blasted off
Now they got a crush on us, they don't like it, they false
