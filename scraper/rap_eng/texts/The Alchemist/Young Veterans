(P talking w/ a friend)

*P starts rapping at 1:03

[Prodigy]
Yeah
Don't try that with P, nah give ya'self a break
You're f'ing with the wrong nigga, do ya'self a favor
Back up offa me lil nigga real fast
Or just like that you'll be pushing up grass
You're a plant fool; I'll put your flesh in the dirt
I tried to be polite, but you wanna be a jerk
Tried to prove a point; the only thing that you proved
Is people get killed simply for being rude
You thought you was the man, turned out to be a chump
You thought something sweet, believe Jay[Z] if you want
Ga'head believe Nas or whoever you choose
You come on over here and you gon' see the truth
It's nothing out the ordinary, this is what we do
My team's so strong, I feel sorry for you
These rappers is pissed off, they're not being felt
They get record deals but their albums get shelved
While I'm...

(Chorus) Prodigy X2
Heavy on the dimers and heavy on the smoke
Pockets full of hundreds, doing hundreds in the post
GT Carrera nigga daring nigga front
Fucking with these young veterans you'll get done

[Prodigy]
We're heavy on the dimers and heavy on the smoke
Pockets full of hundreds, doing hundreds in the post
GT Carrera nigga daring nigga front
Fucking with these young veterans you'll get done
I'll react like a Terminator nigga what?
Won't stop coming till I know a nigga done
Rikers all good, it made me a millionaire
Or when it come time to squeeze yogi, we don't care
Now we thirty-thou feet in the air
Getting head from a pretty face who ain't scared
To fuck with these Gs and she's happy that she did
Cause we turned out to be that shit that she felt
Baby on the real, all these lame niggas now the deal
My dudes give out the wounds that never heal
On the real, all these lame niggas now the deal
My dudes give out the wounds that never heal

(Chorus) Prodigy X2

[Prodigy]
Don't be mad at me, be made at ya'self
For being so garbage you need to be killed
For putting out bullshit like it's all a joke
Cause you're from the hood don't mean your shit's dope
Just cause you got bodies don't mean you're gon' gold
Like just because you're black don't mean you got soul
Niggas coming home from doing wild time
Talk about P - "Yo P I could rhyme"
50 Cent did it; I could do this shit too
But you're not 50, he individual
And you're not H and you're definitely not P
What would make you think it's so easy to be?
I've been doing this since I was a Rugrat
I'm gifted; I'm blessed with talents you can't match
Stop dreaming, wake up and smell the Kush
You better than P? Nah you wish!!!

(Chorus) Prodigy X2
