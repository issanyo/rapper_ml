[Hook]
It goes one for the doe two for the hoes
Nigga if you feel it how I feel it then
You need to go get it
We gon' ride it from the bottom till we sitting on the ceiling
Pop bottle after bottle to intensify the feelin'
We winning

[Verse 1]
My niggas illin we knew from the beginning
We would kill it
From penny pinching to Vegas city sinning
Went from chilling in Syd's crib to first cabin tripping
Hittin bad bitches, too far to even catch feelings
Bitch I'm back wit it
Success make these bitches act different
Mad bitches chasin them model hoes and actresses
And if anybody ask we livin fast on the dash
Tryna blow up so fuck if a nigga crash
Click the ash, bitch we gettin blazed
Feelin' like it's seventh grade
Sippin' champagne for the moments that we couldn't save
Feel like my reign is only days away
So make a toast and lets celebrate to the paper chase

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
For the rush, it's for the dream, it's for the feeling, it's for the moment
It's for the victory; the reason I leave mess of my opponents
It's for the hustle
And the grind and all the hours you ain't notice
We be workin' so hard and we be feelin' like we owed this
It's for the moment, bitch we own shit
That's why we drinkin' and we smokin' tryna slow shit
Happy while we got it, cause the only thing we really know is
Right now, we the focus
When your days become your dreams and your dreams become reality
Sleep is obsolete because your mind is working rapidly
When people who laugh taking success as a causality
When you get that feeling like your vision is in fact in reach
I wish that feeling to all my bitches and all my niggas
I hope you realize our path; it may be walking with us
May all your pain be champagne, we all could live up
So when I roll up to celebrate you should spark it with us

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
I bust mine for real, see this for real
It's not a fluke, I really shoot
Don't give a fuck, I ain't no nice guy or nothin'
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm nice to the bitches, not no nigga
Nigga come around me, you get hurt, anything can happen to you
You know what I'm sayin'?
