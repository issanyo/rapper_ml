Yo this beat is nice man

[Verse 1]
Isolating myself like a fridge
Needing things to fill me up
Seeing opportunities that connect a bridge
Only having figments of imagination
Holding on i’m aligning my intuition
Not criticizing my psyche
Not attaching the shit that psyche me
Venturing through books, absorbing
Writing memories in ink
Like i said before no mo critique
From me rather a darkness forming
My memories becoming fragmentations
My own negativity bringing me down
My sorrows that internally making me drown
Sketching images in the brain
Just hoping that shit won’t be twirling like a hurricane

{Hook]
(*smoke break*)
Venturing through with the crew
At night or day at 2
What u gotta do
Within the fields of grass
Boy, give me sum to pass
Out of my view
Venturing through
Venturing through
Venturing through
Aw shit they coming fo us boy

[Verse 2]
What i gotta expect
I don't even know the type of suspense
Getting things outta my conscience
Hanging with the homies through the road
Detailing life stories to each other
Feelin like we each our own brother
Oh wait i'm psychotic
Meaning i never had that plutonic
Like constructing a hole in my skull
I think my life is pretty dull
Only glimpses of my world that unfold
Writing in ink making it difficult for a lefty
Smudging every ideas that shows u a way
The client pissed won't even try to pay
Painting memories the ways to create
Lost communication that people fixate, fixate

{Hook]
(*smoke break*)
Venturing through only u
At night or day at 2
What u gotta do
Within the field of grass
Giving myself sum to pass
Out of my view
Venturing through
Venturing through
Venturing through
Ay boy give me that blunt, I want something to pass my view boy

Naw, bruh you just a figment of my imagination, just...driving alone... i don't know, just me and my demon in my brain
