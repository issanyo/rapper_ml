[The Alchemist]
Now that I’m on
I don’t know why they wanna hate me, man
I pull up, roll that window down, say ‘What’s up’ to my kinfolk
Yeah—What’s up, kinfolk?
See, now, now that I’m on, it’s real lonely
They say it’s lonely at the top, but it’s real crowded at the bottom
So I what I want you do is just roll up that reefer if you got it
And just smoke it…yeah
