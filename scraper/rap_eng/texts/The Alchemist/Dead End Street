Shh. Woo. Buc 5'9.

Hook:
Walkin' down a dead end street
I saw you walkin' down a dead end street
You can't cross me
Walkin' down a dead end street
I saw you walkin' down a dead end street
Fuckin' wit me
Walkin' down a dead end street
I saw you walkin' down a dead end street
Killin' tonight

Verse 1:
"It's not necessary to lay a foul tongue on me, my friend."
That only leads to dead ends. Tu' comprende, comprehend?
I'm a human warhead
Please mercy, you know better
Fuck the Khan with the knowledge of wealth that I'ma shed
"Break bread, death breeds money.", Bucfusius said
But I ain't gonna die alone. I put somebody to bed
I ain't Sylvester, but I'm still a looooone young Judge Dread
And to the streets I plead:
Down with the hardest of heads
Call me, 'Bucky The Kid' or 'Buctradamus'
'King Buc', for short or 'King Buc and Common'
Campaign bucanomics
Sucka free street movement are bionic
High power, supersonic, movin' faster than comets
Indian hit Dr. Shaman worth my weight in the diamonds
Plus I'll make you die, man

Hook

Verse 2:
I leave trails of bullet shells
Like Hansel & Gretel
Did with the bread
But except instead
To get home I follow the path of the dead
Puttin' lt back together like Smooth B & Ray
Retarded kids are smarter, kid. I'm sick in the head
Christopher Reevein' niggas was the way I was bred (he he)
Slidin' on fools like Jamaican bobsleds
Make rastas dread
Grab heat from tool shed
And these are the straps that I manifest
I'm waitin' to catch wreck on all you fuckheads
Mission's at the continent
With the usual suspects that you can't neglect
Get real with or play chess
I take showers in my pants, more luck than Irish
Why you jam like tecs?
I'm taxin' like the IRS
Signin' out, Buc, but again: adios, god bless
MC's was a better remake

Hook
Killin' technology
I call lt bucnology
