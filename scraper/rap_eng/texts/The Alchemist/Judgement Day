[Verse:]
Ohhh… what you may think
A feeling you can’t escape
His eye is on every place
You might as well give up your sins
And let Christ live within
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooo
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooo
Judgement Day
Oh it ain’t far away
Give up your sins (give up your sins)
Ooo (x4)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Won’t you let Christ in within
