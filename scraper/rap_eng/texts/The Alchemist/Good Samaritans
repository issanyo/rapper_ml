[Verse 1: Jonwayne]
Ever since my birth had my heels up in the dirt
Yet these bitches wipe me down like I'm ketchup on their shirt
Veterans on the corner slipping [?] sipping [?]
Got some nerve to claim that ypu can't fuck with Jonny written word
If you want to do it has to have my signature
I've been skating on the paper since I learn to write in cursive
You a lost thug putting mustard on a turnip
Tryna toss some butt up in the middle of a circus
Tryna sing a tune but I'm turning all your circuits
If you wanna test then claim the flow is not perfect
You can sip your fucking tea and mind your business like Kermit
Swear to God I got my holy fuck permit
I'm the only rapper that can make 'em duck nervous
I'm a wild ass goose getting loose upon you vermin
Mind was so fucked I was losing all my virgins
72 bitches in my closet just twerking
If there is a hell then the Devil has the number to my cell
Hit me if you want to feel unwell
Or hit me if you want to feel the bottom of a well
You see Lucifer is afraid of me dragging them down aswell
It's a good samaritan flow
Letting narratives go until the cows are coming home from my shows

[Verse 2: Samiyam]
Everything I said I'd do is now validated
Go ahead say I'm a fool until your blue my moves are smooth and calculated
Look at my plate, you hate to see the food but you salivated
Off a yacht I'm diving naked while your signing affidavit
And everything you claim is exaggerated
You look as bad today but with everything you say it's exacerbated
From the bullshit I graduated
You looked emasculated when your girl saw my portrait and masturbated
Haha, I'm the truth I'm never wrong
But sometimes I'm smarter than I give myself credit for
Concerned with reality so much I forget the law
There's money being made I got to get involved, give it to me
