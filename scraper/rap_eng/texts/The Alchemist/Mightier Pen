[Hook: Prodigy]
These people start with me then they get mad when I flip out
I kill my adversaries, my enemies, my competition
These people start with me then they get mad when I flip out
I kill my adversaries, my enemies, my competition

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yeah, yo, yo
By the stroke of my hand, words out my pen
You really want this war? Cool let's begin
I'm more raw than beef with blood still drippin'
More cool than A/C, my religion
Is Mobb Deep rap music
You speak blasphemy, you badmouthing P
It be nothing but pain in your future, and fear of death
Every step you take cautious, you never know when
A strike from my hand gon' land on your head, get the
Get the message, You heard what I said
Ventriloquist when I send a few soldiers
Niggas tryin' to force me to be pussy
Niggas tryin' to force me to be scared
I'm too cold blooded, and so not having that
His excuse was he was unaware
Now he crying in my motherfucking ears

[Hook: Prodigy]
These people start with me then they get mad when I flip out
I kill my adversaries, my enemies, my competition
These people start with me then they get mad when I flip out
I kill my adversaries, my enemies, my competition

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
I got the mightier pen, your sword is rusty
Old ass niggas can't keep up with me
A lot of these new niggas raps is musky
Stink like hot garbage, and y'all supposed to be
Hip-hop's new generation
I'm still waiting for some bars, have me saying
Oh my effing G, Prodigy rap rings round every MC
The gangstas be loving him, the killers in the hood, nah
They don't want none of him, cause they know he one of them
But you want to bring the bullshit this way
Your lifetime on earth will be a short stay
Why people want to start with me a  nd get mad when I flip on them
'Till the cops when I spit on 'em, yeah I shit on 'em
You supposed to be gangsta, nigga you a femme
Fatale, let me put this pistol down
Before I spit on this ug' ass women and child
I'm not that nigga who you want me to be, I'm a bad boy nigga (you'll see, you'll see, you'll see)

[Hook: Prodigy]
These people start with me then they get mad when I flip out
I kill my adversaries, my enemies, my competition
These people start with me then they get mad when I flip out
I kill my adversaries, my enemies, my competition
