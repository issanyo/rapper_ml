White carpet in my Scarface house
No undergarments on my Scarface spouse
My Elvira twisting that reefer and delivering that dough
To the front door like a pizza carryin
Her own weight financially, she don't need me
She just in love with a real nigga, continuously weeded
At my undisclosed location
Reading up on V-12 engines
And the greatest strains this season
And I grind for that very reason
The toxic air that I'm breathing leave the average man weakened
Watermarks still on the houses as I drive by em
Crack the sunroof, let a cloud out it. Trill shit
Next time I vacate, I'm bringing all my cars on the plane with me
We gon' show our folks how to make them millions
Grappling hooks, scaling the building
Rap with no hooks, I'm high how is you feelin
Captain Hook whilin' and sailin'
Though no stealin'
That shit hurt, I know the feeling
These niggas'll borrow your style like
You wasn't about to do nothing with it
That's why I only kick it with real niggas like Dom Kennedy
And people I ain't got to name cause they was probably here
Getting high with me
If y'all don't know where to put it at, don't ride with it
Cause theyâ€™ll try to lose you in the system for some weed in my city
In the hood, ain't no love or no pity
Looking for charity? That dog don't hunt, don't come in the woods with it
