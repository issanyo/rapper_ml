[Verse 1: Chuuwee]
My barbershop rhyming
Quest told him what's a goon to a grown man
Tell Houston we've got a problem
We have lift off so tell 'em that I don't want to land
High as fuck I said it before
I came to bring the pain hardcore
You Aries Spears, I'm Aries the god of war
Better be G—çs in my palm when I perform
Keep calm under pressure if you don't give us alarm
Then a bunch of killer bees going to swarm like a swat team
Game cold I heard just like a iceberg
Niggas try me I turn 'em Rodney, hockey
Get beat down, do you got me?
Sock it to niggas like a bopper, boxer, Ali
No nigga tops me, I place tips
On whoever try to stop me, a net never caught me
Get 'em drunk nigga, sloppy
A nigga pop me then I'll be a new Pac, Veli, Maki
Me and my team moving at mach speeds
You twenty per hour and I's mach-3
Copy cats be trying to jock me and mock me
Label booked my flight, yours was not free
Oxycontin got me
Yelling out ollie-ollie oxen free, she yell papi
Yeah, yeah nigga who got beef?
I bust raps like I chop trees
I chop trees then re-up and re-cop seeds
Green thumb then I take it back to the block streets
And niggas lift off
C-section niggas probably pissed off
Better cut your bitch dog
