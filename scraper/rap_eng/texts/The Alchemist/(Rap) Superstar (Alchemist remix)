No matter what you just been through, this gotta be right. You gotta approach people, you gotta be on the up and up, everything's gotta be all good. When you see somebody, slap hands wit 'em, you know what I'm sayin'? Give 'em a pound of whatever it is, you know but you always gotta act like ain't ____ wrong. You know, when there might be twenty-million things wrong wit you but they don't know that. They just see, you know, what they see and if, if you refuse 'em an autograph, "Oh Eminem is a _____, he's a ______, well yo ____ you then

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
Your big house, five cars
You're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

I remember the days when I was a young kid, growin' up
Lookin' in the mirror, dreamin' about blowin' up

The rock crowds, make money
Chill with the honeys
Sign autographs or whatever the people want from me
S____ funny

How impossible dreams manifest
And the games that be comin' with it, nevertheless

You gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know

About the blood sweat and tears
And losin' some of your peers

And losin' some of yourself through the years past, gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy

Egomaniac in the brainiac
Don't know how to act
___t's deep, 48 tracks
Studio gangsta max

Signed the deal thinks he's gonna make a mil
But never will 'til he crosses over, still

Fillin' your head with fantasies
Come with me
Show the sacrifice it takes to make the cheese

You wanna be a rap superstar, in the biz
And take ____ from people who don't know what it is

I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high and some can't pay the way

Feel trapped in what you rappin' about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout

What route you took started collapsin'

No fans, no fame
No respect, no change
No women and everybody _____ on your name

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
Your big house, five cars
You're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
Your big house, five cars
You're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

When you sign to a record label, you don't know you sign your life over and these white boys don't care about you 'cause the minute you fall off they'll find another Noreaga and they'll find another Capone-N-Noreaga and they'll find another B-Real so you need to just keep, stack your chips up, do what you gotta do while you hot and mother ______ get out the game just just like the drug game it's even worse because in the drug game if somebody jerk you, you can _____ 'em and __ll 'em and if you in this game if somebody jerk you, you gotta be humble

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
Your big house, five cars
You're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
Your big house, five cars
You're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly

My own son don't know me
I'm chillin' in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm with my holmies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or video's gonna show me
No love, they're phony
Gotta hit the road solely
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the middle like mony
And the press say that
My own people disown me
And the best way back

Is to keep your head straight, never inflate the cranium
You're too worried about them honeys at the Peladium

Who just wanna cling on, swing on
And so on, go on, fall off, the hoes roll on

To the next rap superstar, with no shame
Give him a year and they'll be right out the game

The same as the last one who came before him
Gained fame started gettin' ignored, I warned him
Assured him

This ain't easy
Take it from Reazy
Sleazy people wanna be so cheesy
They're ______ evil

So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
Your big house, five cars
You're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
Your big house, five cars
You're in charge
Comin' up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
