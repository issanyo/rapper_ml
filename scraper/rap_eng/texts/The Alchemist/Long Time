[Intro]
[?] , Amen
Aye yo, amen
Yo

[Verse 1]
My transformative years was a blur
Statues on the dashboard of a Benz in the dirt
Lookin' hurt
United States embark on the cargo we look tomorrow
Fast forward with friends in the spur gettin' served
That probably would depends on if it's worth a nigga syrup
Crack daughter want the [?] purchasing the Nerf
[?] in her orange fresh squeeze murdering the fur
Sweet [?] stood on that heat burgers on the grill
Deep in the bullshit
It's nothin' you could spit I'm legit
Cops got the fifth I beat the federal charge quick
I'm not the stiff
Wavy steez's with raw, shit, I get the job did
You niggas is horse shit, we on shit
Regardless fuck what the moral is
I got the [?]
You don't hear me though
Used to see that bitch directly right beside him
So she probably wasn't really broke
I hear she making videos (videos)

[Verse 2]
That nigga [?] buzz me into the building
He used to spray the 'piff with cocaine water that was the feeling
Now if you don't know no better my other nigga pack was shakey
But that coat Rosetta speaking Spanish
Babies down the hill, selling them oxtails for dollar bills
You think that Black and Mild was something that was not a real
Buzzo keep fuckin' 'bout the jail
He messin' up the snatch, facts
Yo Black I think we got appealed
Walkin' for Morris
You and your [?] Maplewood and [?] and [?]
Wollies leaning like they percocets
You niggas surf the net
Hop off the wave before you hurt your head
My fall popped off the K you niggas turned burlesque
We surfaced
Got niggas coming out of coogis in checkers parking lot
My niggas shirtless
We merciless
From [?] all the way to Main street get your tape leaked
Infer the rest
I'm just a [?] viking
Watch me cross the seven seas on my feet
Ain't another jailbird like him (not the same)
You wanted beef we brought bison
Dyke men
(You don't want no smoke)
(You don't want no smoke, no sauce)
(You don't want no sauce)
(Y'all don't like that?)

[Outro]
Ever since
From long time
Long time, long time
Pack the mac and [?] actin practice my own shot
Won't stop, won't stop

S65 we don't die, multiply
