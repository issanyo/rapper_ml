[Verse 1:]
Won’t you praise my Jesus
Praise the name of Jesus
Won’t you praise my Jesus
Praise ye the Lord

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus:]
We’ve got a job to do
And we’ve got a job to do
Judgement Day is soon upon us
Soon upon us [x2]

[Chorus:]
And we’ve got a job to do [x2]
Judgement Day is soon upon us
Mmmhm upon us (x7 to fade)
