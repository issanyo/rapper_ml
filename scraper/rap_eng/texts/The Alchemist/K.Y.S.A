[Verse 1]
Air never ever seemed so far away
I'm in the eye of a hurricane, I, and I tried
Death never ever seemed so touchable
I'm a dart caught in your cables, I, and I tried

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive

[Verse 2]
So babe, where you wanna hide your face tonight
In a hall I walk into the bright light, does that help?
So save me, cause you know that’s not the end of us
I’ll be runnin' till you get it right
Impossible, impossible, impossible

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
