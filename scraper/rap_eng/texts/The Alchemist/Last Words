[Intro: Prodigy]
This is it, here, end of the road
No more, no more suffering, no more tears
No more ghosts, souls

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
To my family, hope hearing this in good health
Forgive me, for not being there to be the father of the house
Daddy was inolved with lots of shit
And the truth is, it wasn't always like this
I used to be an innocent, lil' momma's boy
Hung around the wrong crowd, sided with the wrong boys
Got involved with the mega games, extortion and more
Did crime, fed time shit and never got caught, cause
DA's bought the supreme court couldn't touch me
I'm riding above the law but
Time passes and, people grow
And things change when that flow became smarter
Wiser and learning how to apply my strength
Gettin' power, earnin' strikes through my actions then
Money came easy, problem was how to spend it
Stacey Adams shoes, jewelry out the planet
Droppin' house money on cars, buildin' the money on cribs
But haunted by the ghosts of the things I did

[Outro: Kokane]
Before I go to my, final resting place
I will write a letter, they're coming for me
Why the hell I was even here
Going, alone
