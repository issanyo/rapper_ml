[Verse 1: ZAVAGE]
The story of a family man of no relation
Reigns over the underworld, no precipitation
Bonds in the fall with men stone cold as the winter
Had his thanksgiving dinner with contract killers
His only goal, was to go and make his son live successful
Cuz if he lived like him his life would be so regretful
So he had to make the money to protect his investment
Started moving bricks again before he was selling weapons
Them drugs fiends hungry, don't bite the hand that feed you
But something bout moving ki's made his soul feel evil
Then my cousin got hooked and it wasn't on purpose
That look in the boys eyes made him seem so worthless
I had invited him over, keep him away from that struggle
Ain't talking vonage, but the devil had that boy in a bundle
Said "Nick when you grow up man what do u aspire to be?"
He said "another dead dread head is all I see for me"
I told him, keep ya head up and stay out of trouble
Come back to the dmv and I'll give u a triple double
He confessed, & told me Costello was his connect
And he ain't pay him yet so he would come for his neck
So I called up uncle C and said I would give him the payment
Last thing I need is his body all on the pavement
Now in the middle of it, I felt like he was in danger
The only others that was hip was Mike, Makayla, & Tejah
Then a few months later, lack of ki's had made him sick
So I crept in C's crib and Walked out with a brick
Before I knew it, he was in the hospital overdosing
Before it ended, they told me he was comatose for the moment

[Hook 2x: ZAVAGE]
Uh, real deal mob fiction
Movies & music that mix to my addiction
La famila is everything, but what if yo real family get mixed up into all them thangs

[Verse 2: ZAVAGE]
Got a call in school , moms was like bad news
Nick woke up early and ran away around noon
Hospital staff still can't locate, but keep him in ya prayers boy I'll bet you he'll be okay
My own fam tried to cross me on the low low
Cuz now I'm stuck working off a debt for Costello
He was finna' take him out, no dinner date
And settle business you know, the old fashion way
But instead I begged now I'm working by the bay
You know the Chesapeake moving cargo on the weekdays
Told momma I was doing service hours
Don't do reports no Matt Lauers, Uh
Last box of the day, i'm moving it to a truck that he kept in the back way
It was different from the others, never asked questions
Drop the box, broke the locket, I seen the smith & Wesson
Look in the crate picked up the lobster, Mac 11 laid inside , I had to stop bruh
You know them days like this put fear in Ya, fixing up the mess like a school cafeteria
Can't sleep, like I'm Trynna dodge Kruger , don't be a loser
Maybe I should go and cop a ruger
Handle business, this way me & Nick don't get finished
Nah man forget that, these are made men I'll end up like tic tack
Toe in a row crossed out in a chalk line
Momma crying, lil zavage victim of a homicide
Can't have that , that ain't a smart move
Lil brother see me on tv like his cartoons
So I kicked it at the crib for a minute got my mind right
And I really started thinking different
Wasn't finna run out like the ending of a time limit
So I hit up the bay acting like I never even did it
That morning Costello called me to his office
Felt like he was calling me to my coffin
But you know how bosses be , but he acknowledged me
In a way that to me almost felt fatherly
Said "hey kid don't get tense I know what happened dude"
Slide me about like 5 dubs and said "I'm proud of you"
Said "you staid true, learned something that I never even taught you
A part of this thing of ours yo,  a true virtue
Omert√† can never be purchased
Loyalty is everything , But you can't keep holding what's gonna hurt you"

[Verse 3: ZAVAGE]
Man me and my cousin was always side by side
He had kept the dog, I was the blind guy
Without him all I could see was the green made at least 2 g's
See money was my friend these days and we'ld bond like James
But hey things change I'm moving up anyways
Working at the bay prolly shipping ak's and dope but that's the cost
But honestly I never really know
I hear that voice from uncle c you know and all his scheming
Why he trusted me sometimes I never knew the reason
Different seasons, I was doing favors meeting strange folks
Men in flashy suits and handing out envelopes
Had me running errands, wasn't even pushing boxes tho
Felt like Christopher you know with my uncle soprano
Except it all flipped so quick in a split
When Nick typed my digits and texted me this, he did it real quick
"Meet me by Laurel lakes get a ride however ok , tell yo parents anything go head' say it's a double date just meet me
I really need ya help b and you know how these things be"
So I meet him by ledos pizza, had little chin hairs, for a minute, all I could do was stare
Look at my cousin ,my first homie coked up on the corner looking lonely
We used to dodge rain drops, and do the impossible but know
I don't know how we supposed to climb this obstacle
He said "I hear you in with Costello yo is it true?"
Said "don't even trip man just know I looked out for you."
In his I saw eyes paranoia, he forgot we was boys and the drugs was just destroying that loyalty that I knew he had for me
Passed him a Hundo and said "Yo I hope God bless"
Gave him a hug and I felt the wire tapped to his chest
Like dang (beat) Now I'm really tripping
Who knew the one I looked up to was actually snitching
Said "I just wanted to see ya know, how you doing kid
I already talked to Costello, it's water under the bridge."
Burt I know C don't ride like that
I seen him go and shoot at the same people that he'd pat on the back
So I dapped up Nick real quick and started to dip
Then on my way to the crib a car pulled up, I recognized it
From the outside, It was Costello's ride
He said "hop in young one we need to talk aight"
And there I was, like cake batter caught up in the mix
Then we drove to a restaurant off I-96
That night left me with murder contemplation
Let me play for y'all the rest of that dinner conversation
Hold up
