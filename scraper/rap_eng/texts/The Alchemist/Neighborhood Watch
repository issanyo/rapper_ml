[Intro: Evidence] + (Iriscience)
The neighborhood watch (Is jewels and spots)
It's mine and yours (Let's guard the block)
This ain't the cops (It's the neighborhood watch)
It's mine and yours

[Verse 1: Evidence]
When I was young the neighborhood watched
Us get down on a cardboard box in vacant lots
Well down on Venice Beach, you had to jet before dark
The freaks come out at night to spark
Write with my right, bat with my left hand
Hearing of a blind cat, vision of a deaf man
Breath through my eyelids, my flow keeps my teeth white
Half B-boy, half Z-boy, the street lights watch
The neighborhood watch it is jewels and spots
It's mine and yours, Let's guard the block
This ain't the cops, It's the neighborhood watch
It's mine and yours, Let's guard the block

[Verse 2: Iriscience]
Watch your colours and watch your slang
Watch how your fingers twist and change
Alot of cats out here ain't playin'
Alot of cats here still can't bang
Me? I don't bang, I rock the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminding me I should rhyme
And not floss but invest in mine
And hope it never comes to the best in nine
But hey, the neighborhood watch guard the block
Watch for criminals and watch for cops
It ain't gon' stop, it's the neighborhood watch
Watch for criminals and watch for cops

[Hook: scratched by DJ Babu]
Neighborhood watch (x4)

[Evidence]
Protect your own, protect your home
Respect the hustle and set the tone
Entertain but drop gems mostly
Like, don't covet your neighbour but watch him closely

[Iriscience]
Closed circuit, checking the street
Between blessing the beat and stressing to eat
Between my first breath and resting in peace
Between keeping the peace and arresting police

[Evidence]
The eyes have it, once again it's your Peoples
Blacked out your tinted windows, we still see you
The streets is breathing, the streets is watching
The streets start trends and end them - be cautious

[Iriscience]
Black Panthers, Brown Berets
We watched the watchers and found a way
I see it all like a fly on the wall
And thats real gay, so keep your eye on the ball

[Evidence]
The neighborhood watch is jewels and spots
It's mine and yours, let's guard the block
This ain't the cops, It's the neighborhood watch
It's mine and yours, let's guard the block

[Iriscience]
The neighborhood watch, guard the block
Watch for criminals and watch for cops
It ain't gon' stop, it's the neighborhood watch
Watch for criminals and watch for cops
