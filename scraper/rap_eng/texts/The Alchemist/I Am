Yo; I'm a snare, I'm a drum, don't care where you're from
Started in the parks, now look what I've become
I'm a loud mic, I'm the ("emcee) down right
I'm the one to get the crowd hyped
I've been sampling Michael and Lionel
I'm rap music, twelve inches pressed up on vinyl
Nowadays I'mma rare song; I'm white boys
With backpacks and hats who wear they hair long
I'm in every ghetto (every) worldwide, never settle (never)
I'm even heavymetal with the devil (ha ha ha)
I'm ill rhymes and dope beats
Starter hats, fat laces, rope chains, and gold teeth
I'm graffiti, you wanna be me
I'm rich, but mainly the needy trust that, believe me
I'mma never switch spots (never) I'm Kool Herc
Run-D.M.C., Rakim, I'm hip-hop

[Hook: scratches]
"I'm hip-hop, so check it out"
"To the hiddip, the hop, you don't stop"
"I am" "hip-hop" "so check it out"
"Cause who I'm talkin 'bout y'all is" "hip, hop"

Yo, aiyyo I'm in BK when I write this poem
I'm two turntables and a microphone
Yo the feelin you get when you hear an ill line
The pad you scribble your rhyme into to kill time
I guess I'm kind of Summer Jam
I'm the larger rap than Kid 'N Play and the Running Man
Nowadays everyone wanna be this
From, MY, A-DIDAS!
Shell toes, I'm Luda throwin elbows
How you wear your pants, where you rock a cell phone
I'm battlin for hardcore props
I'm breakdancin daily on a cardboard box
What other flavor could, have kids pumpin
N.W.A. in an all white neighborhood?
I'm hot, when you kids not
I'm Big, L, Pun, Notorious, I'm hip-hop

[Hook: scratches]
"I'm hip-hop, so check it out"
"To the hiddip, the hop, you don't stop"
"I am" "hip-hop" "so check it out"
"It ain't nuttin like hip-hop"

Yo, I'm Slick Rick's stories, lots to tell
I'm the greatest of all time, yeah I +Rocked the Bells+
Sometimes I fool you (ha ha) cause in ninety-two
I had y'all rockin Cross Colours and FUBU
Maybe I start a couple brawls with the cops (yup!)
I'm everywhere now, but I was born in the Bronx (B-X~!)
They made me ice and bling (made it)
It seems no one's Spike Lee'n and +Doin the Right Thing+
Went from Jheri curls to flat tops the steezes
Then Reebook pump sneakers to beepers
And I never care about who's on top
I'm Ralph McDaniels and Video Music Box
I'm hype, chill, dope, fly, fresh, ill
Fat, bangin (what?) and hot to death
Aiyyo, I'm known to rip spots (rip 'em)
I'm Melle Mel, G. Rap and Grandmaster Flash, I'm hip-hop

[Hook: scratches]
"Check it out" "I am" "hip-hop"
"To the hiddip, the hop, you don't stop"
"Hip-hop culture, something you live"
"I came here to represent my people" "check it out"
"Hip-Hop" {*repeated*}
