[Verse 1]
One time for the kids with no parents at home
Two times for single mothers raising ‘em on they own
Daddy in jail, they already expected to fail
Get locked, another story to tell
Where I come from, you either hustle or you starve, slang or play ball
If not, then get a job
I hear a lot of brothers complain, but see, life is what you make it
So I hopped on a plane
And followed my dreams, left the world that I knew
From a bird’s’ eye view, I peeped it: all the shit I been through
Would break the average man down but I’m still here
I went from rhyming on the corner, turned it to a career
I went from a group home to Michael Peretta’s house
I’m thinkin’ ‘bout: What if I had taken the other route?
I’d probably be another name on a wall
Or a face on a shirt if I wasn’t lacing this verse
But who knows…this is my world

[Chorus]
It’s your world…where are you?
Would you share it…if it was cool?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, maintain, persevere by any means
If you sleep, how you gonna live out your every dream?
Game from an OG passed down to me
So I’m up when everybody in the town’s asleep
Still tryna hold on and survivin’ peers
Too many R.I.P.’s, empty bottles of beer
See, I come from a small town
And, oh, you ain’t know, this is how we get down
Burner in the pea coat, preferably Desert Eagles
Let off and reload, get ready for the sequel
It happens every night, we from ‘round here, so we know
Niggas hearts and half as big as they ego
No job so, how we ‘posed to provide the honest way?
Look his son in his eyes, he need pay
Despite the lack of funds, he tells him it’ll be okay
They cuttin’ off welfare any day
Welcome to my world

[Chorus]
It’s your world…where are you?
Would you share it…if it was cool?

[Outro dialogue]
This was, like, way before records were, I mean, even thought about being made
There was no such thing as a recording artist, rapper on a record, so to speak, you know
(What do you have on now?)
This was a real popular record, you know, in its time
And at this point here, it still is
I would just try to, like, take it apart and put together again
