[Intro: LNDN DRGS]
Steppin
Cool as can be, it's...
(I’m steppin out)
When nothing more is shaking
And while the brakes ain't braking
That's when the feelin takes me..

[Verise 1: Jay Worthy]
Steppin out bread Cortez, I’m out the house
Double click unlock the rental, know what I'm about
Hit Crenshaw and take that mothafucka down
Bangin OD, smokin' OG, took the hood up proud
By my lonely I can't even trust the homies
They'll have you in a twist, don't you know them niggas phoney
Said my niggas from the go, Circle smaller than a Roley
Face glistenin' on my wrist, thought they told you life's a bitch
Only realest in my click, all my niggas lookin’ rich
But we done came from the times, didn’t have a pot to piss
Now I pull up in that 6, Couple homies off the mix
Tall dre serve on?, they be yellin' that’s it!
Step into the function, tryin' to knock a niggas bitch

[Hook]
Ready to take some chances
Steady, no backward dances
Shine up my shoes for dancing
Saying goodbye to Mr...
{I'm steppin' out}

[Verse 2: $ha Hef]
In the kitchen, 2 steppin with the 12 gauge
I kept me 2 weapons since the 12th grade
In and out the church, but was hell raised
Bullets burn like hell, when the shells graze
Fly whoopin’, All white 5 coupin'
4-5 on me, got the 5 guys slidin' through it
Black 9 match the black 9-5 how I shoot it?
5-5 9 hoes clockin', ask me how do I do it?
Really limpin', I been turnin bitches since Helly-Hansens
Diamonds in the friend been hittin, look like they belly dancin'
Naw, I ain't focus in the coke drought
Baggin' zips up in the smoke house
I'm tryin to turn this smoke to a boat house
All that dope, I can probably turn the Pope out

[Hook]
Ready to take some chances
Steady, no backward dances
Shine up my shoes for dancing
Saying goodbye to Mr...
{I'm steppin' out}
