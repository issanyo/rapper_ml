[Napoleon Da Legend verse]

Hey yo dinner is served time to eat Po
Sting em with the venom and crack em in they ego
Moves I never telegraph hook me to a polygraph
That’s a green light for every single paragraph
I tend to grab attention like Teddy Pendergrass
Been killing it and that’s been a fact
I been a dad without a biological seed
Shining despite the obstacles from diabolical breeds
I’m Godspeed lock me in don’t box me in
My toxic pen increase the flow of oxygen
Inside ya cells and molecules cause these slots is slim
To Pac’s chagrin he died and y’all dropped the clip
Rasta grit apocalypse more knots to grip
This ain’t Medina you can steal this we won’t chop ya wrist
Middle of Medina spittin growing crops from bricks
My mindstate is money making when I cross the bridge
Corny artists disrespecting they brain
Calling themselves recording artist
Like it’s one of the same "no it’s not"
That’s artificial Botox chip of the old box
Knock the chip off of ya shoulder Mr. Robot slash
Same emotion when ya phone got snatched
Wave riding cruising on they lil boat got gassed
This is counter culture, put against over the counter culture
Flatbush and nostrand corners eastern and Saratoga
A pack of Funyuns with a peach flavor Arizona
I mix it with a little vodka and it got me zoning
This ain’t fluff we ain’t cut from the same stuff
Let a 3 fly at the buzzer chump, games up!
U working on ya fantasy bracket I’m changing tax brackets
Staying away from the Jake snakes and backstabbers
This mathematics back to when the fact mattered
Throw my body out the window hear the glass scattered
