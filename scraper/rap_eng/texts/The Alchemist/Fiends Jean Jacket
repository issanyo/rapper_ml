[Verse 1]
I make the bread like my grandmother
Ran numbers, tan butters, shooters, hustlers and gram cutters
Silk short, three-quarter V cream
Sing a sad song it's the corner fiend theme
Jean jacket bleach white, peach tight, clean Nikes
Three strikes trynna reach heights
Shorty make a mean rice, dress nice, live esteem lives
Suede foot push a green five, smoke the medicine
Got some family on the run like Terry Pendleton
Braveheart shit, you fuck around end up in the graveyard dick
While you see me sipping whiskey in a stage car kid
Yeah, pump Reebok, game like Vlade Divac
TonI Kukoc, I'm 'bout to cop a few boats
Orange juice, toast, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes
Smoke the ?, bitch

[Hook]
I want the marble to the door, linen to the ankle
Basket woven loafs, hoes for sowing oats
The leather jacket with the waist belt, money buried in the lake
Somebody pray for me for heaven's sake

I got the shorty drawing me a bath
I got the North American elk in the oven
It's behind the oven door, what more can I ask for right now but drugs?

[Verse 2]
Heavy body - Gerrit Badenhorst, banana porsche
Manhattan lofts, I'm rugged but the fabric soft
Queens borough you can hear them letting hammers off
Overseas I'm David Hasselhoff
Airport to the whore spot
Whip the sport drop
Little dad got soul like the Four Tops
Hop out scoop your bitch like a shortstop
The Realest playing out the speakers, and the door knock
Fuck her throat 'til she vomit
Now she in the kitchen making omelets
Weed blue hair like Sonic
My kids' feet Louie Vutton-ed it
Shooting through the air like a comet
My father drinking gin and tonic
Cashmere a neck, beard red, deer head
When I speak it's to the point just like a spearhead
Dead bears lay on mahogany floors
Tables in glass, nowadays I'm asian in math, pussy

[Hook]
