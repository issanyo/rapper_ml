[Intro: The Alchemist]
ALC and the S-E-double B…
Just pay attention real quick…(Let’s go)

[Verse: The Alchemist]
I feel like P-A-C, All Eyez is On Me
Like D.O.C. when he met the D-R-E
The top prospect stepping through the NYC
Said these streets give a fuck about the NYP
D Blues, making moves like the Running Man, I’ll stay on my twos
‘Cause if I get caught, I’m making the news
Let the people talk about me all that they want to
All they gotta do is spell my name right and I’m cool
Like the summer breeze soak in the coupe
The vultures on the prowl looking for something to scoop
Diggin’ in the crates for something to loop
That’s how I bag all the broads, ‘cause I ain’t got nothin’ to prove
Now I’m back up in the booth corrupting the youth
Update the youngin’s, I keep them up in the loop
I’m an outcast, so I don’t keep up with the group
Drink like an Alkaholik, smoke like my cousin Snoop

[Prodigy] “I don’t play, I stay, I’m going for mine”
[Cassidy] “They hatin’ ‘cause I’m on the grind”
“I’ve seen niggas come and go, but I’m a stayer”
“Won’t stop”

[Prodigy] “I don’t play, I stay, I’m going for mine”
[Cassidy] “They hatin’ ‘cause I’m on the grind”
“I’ve seen niggas come and go, but I’m a stayer”
[Noreaga] “You ain’t ready yet, slow down…”
[Jadakiss] “Pay attention”
