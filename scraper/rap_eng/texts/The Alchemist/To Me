[Verse:]
Oooh
(And I want to tell you about another place)
To meeee
(that I call hell)
To meeeee
(You can go there also)
To meeee
(That’s right)
To meee
To meee
(And I don’t care I’m thinking about heaven)
To mee
(preaching about golden streets)
To meee
(And there will be no strife there…there will be no...)
