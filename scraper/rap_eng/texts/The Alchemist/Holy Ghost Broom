[Verse:]
The cod that connect the [?] to the straw is the  holy ghost
The cords is the [?] and the straw is the membership
Now i’m gonna get started here a minute
In just a little while it’ll all be over
In just a little while we’ll be free
In just a little while my Jesus is coming back
And his sweet, sweet face we’ll see
We’ll be with Jesus
He’s our lord
He’s coming back[x3]
He’s coming back for me
If you don’t wanna walk in the sheep's mess
Stay in front of em
In just a little while[x6]
