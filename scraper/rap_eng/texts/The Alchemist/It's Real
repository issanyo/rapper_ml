[Intro]
DZA
It's real
It's real
Right

[Verse 1]
Really miss what's really hood
Boss nigga big money fuck that little [?]
Long flight touchdown got me a little jugg
Bad bitch cook meal a nigga living good
Haters try to breath it
Light on me I'mma shine like 3m
The end I'm in the suite like Al Capone
High as fuck cowering the air like a drone
Me and my girl, fly as fuck snapshot the world
Go the best view of life, on top of the globe
In my bucket hat and my robe

[Hook]
Something 'bout the way you make me feel, it's real
When I shine you shine, it's real
When I shine you shine, it's real
When I shine you shine
Something 'bout the way roll a kill, it's real
When I shine you shine, it's real
When I shine you shine

[Verse 2]
Really miss what's really good
Turn down saying you wouldn't but you really would
Educated, great speaker still keep it hood
Small waist, fat ass, they wonder how you do it
Down chick she's a lot of things
Spontaneous freaking off fondlin'
Been around the world lot of bad bitches I done seen
Beautiful, never did bundles those are mama jeans
Go with the God he's a safe bet
Good look all them other niggas basic
Smiling at my phone got a great text
Bring latex, fliest nigga since Ma$e left

[Hook]
Something 'bout the way you make me feel, it's real
When I shine you shine, it's real
When I shine you shine, it's real
When I shine you shine
Something 'bout the way roll a kill, it's real
When I shine you shine, it's real
When I shine you shine
When I shine you shine
When I shine you shine
When I shine you shine
When I shine you shine
