[Verse 1: Rakaa]
Look out, watch it, approach with caution
The A-L-C spins like the chrome revolvin’
Bang out, ventilate, air your brain out
While your girl hit the front row to call my name out
It’s the California golden state sunshine glarin’ on ya
Back from Amsterdam thinking kush is more than marijuana
Pure Americana, we’re election victims
Only athletes and hustlers know the metric system
I’m touched, son of a reverend
I send the tithe, play the round, but I don’t hustle heaven
Military hood rhymes like the mic’s a weapon
Militant good times like Michael Evans
Dilated Rakaa rocks the crown of thorns properly
Wear it as a badge of honor, tell ‘em there’s no stopping me
Keep your ojos peeled or the rojo spills
I don’t bang, but I’m loco still

[Verse 2: Fashawn]
I’m a keep doing what I’m doing till you’re done with me
Till it ain’t fun to me
Exposed like somebody unzipped me
It’s going down like rum, whiskey
I puff sticky, like my hundreds and my ones crispy
Just a poet under pressure, only turned him to a diamond
Digging for gold far from a minor, now I’m a grown up
Some think I’m a loner, but for those who know
I roll deep as the Atlantic Ocean with a band of soldiers
Cockin’ they cannons, we rollin’, roll up a gram of that doja
We expandin’, controlling Los Angeles like we own it
Don’t be fooled by the lights, never seen Paradise
More like a pair of dice
Shit, I’m gambling my life away
Hustling, scrambling, damn it I could die today
Immortalized through the rhyme, C-A state of mind
Wish they had a flavor like mine, just the way I was designed

[Verse 3: Evidence]
It’s time to pay the piper, I don’t calm down, I’m hyper
Vent this, Lord forgive those that trespass against us
I don’t trust, I’m never left defenseless
Talking to a brick wall, dawg, fuck friendship
I mean, nowadays it’s all one and the same
Most fronting really only out for your fame
Most dawgs involved for their interest
I just met you, it’s just business
Game recognize game since day one
A-L-C move to the beat of the same drum
E-V stick the topic of discussion
I heard if they smile too much, don’t trust ‘em
Turn the other cheek, my mom say
I pay homage to your diss like Carlito Brigante
Benny Blanco’s back, I be the last to laugh
Look out, if it looks too good, it’s a trap

[Verse 4: Defari]
Aces high, my face is painless
The barrel’s stainless, the handle’s plastic
The weed I bags, oops, I mean contain it
The Porsche, of course I press, I fast lane it
Impress through the city of the West that made me
U.C.L.A. baby, Los Angeles gave me
This unique style, many unfit to imitate
Defari, the name mean top legitimate
I mean legitimate, I’m full-time with benefits
You’re just a little kid, you’re pissing your parents off
See, you the type to pop a case of no way
We the type to pop a case of rosé
No way can you fuck with us on no day
Viva la cannabis, yes, let’s blow away
I know a chemist whose beats punch holes like the dentist
He also from the town where they with the business

[Sample]
You know as an artist I’ve been able to travel around L.A. and learn from different artists, not just people from where I came from, but people from the west side of L.A., eastside, the north and the south. Some of them guys are still painting, some of ‘em not. Like some of them, they got older. I guess they moved on to different things, but you still have some people that were like real good, but—L.A. have a lot of good people from all over
