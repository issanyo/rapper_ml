[Intro]

And now...
Coming to the stage...

[Verse 1]

Smooth but rugged display and grate the face up
Like Big Daddy Kane, shirt is getting laced up
Pasty make-up laying in a box wet
Me and my people stick together like a box set
Make your bitch lift her leg up like a Rockette
Dive in, get my cock wet
Dive out, for a hot sec
Do a spinning back flip off the top step (Yea, we doing wild gymnastics)
Grip oak wheel, Ten stacks make the coach squeal
Laid back eating smoked veal
Got a young gun, all he do is hold steel
All these hoes want to suck me because I'm so real
And I'm so ill
Lay with hoes from Brazil
The wine spill on the Bonneville
No chain and my mama real
I'm folding your chest, I'm boldly to bless
A class of my own and now a days I'm speaking Spanish in Rome
My bitches gorgeous like a classical poem
Don't get caught up in the tactical zone
Leave you sleeping with the Mackerel

[Hook]

Champagne spilling down the glass because we made it
I know you muthafuckas hate it
Don't judge me bitch because I faded
I'm only trying to fuck some hoes

[Verse 2]

Back to me, you only half a G
I'm in Miami fucking hoes with Mark Anthony
Lobster Cantonese
She had a pussy that was fishy like the Bering Sea (you know I ate it though)
When you see me, star fillet the meat
Move so much work got A.D.D
And it's ABC, shifting BMW from 1983
With a Haitian freak

[Big Body Bes Interlude]

Hallelujah
It's me Big muthafuckin' Body, man
I'm out here in muthafuckin' Cali... the state
And I'm out here living wild and I got a situation, man
I's want muthafuckas to stop coming up to me talking about
"I rap, yo. I rap, Big Body, yo. I rap."
Muthafucka, go wrap the belt around your neck, man (Muthafucka)
Go fuck your father (Suffocate your dick)

[Verse 3]

Bong Bong, muthafucka analyze the resume
Babble on has never been a friendly way
I'm knocking 'em out and then I'm running
To the mountains
Crib with the fountain, that's where my son is
He getting head laying in his bed
In a robe, turkey in the stove
Raise your hand if you trying to talk, the llama spark
Find your father's testicles out in Highland park

[Hook]

Champagne spilling down the glass because we made it
I know you muthafuckas hate it
Don't judge me bitch because I faded
I'm only trying to fuck some hoes
