[Verse 1: Big Twinz]
Time's flying and I'm not getting younger
The best days of my life is like '91
On the run as a juvenile living wild
Profile on the hill with them cinder blocks
Pitch game on point just like the White Sox
I'm a thug for life and I won't stop
What up, ops? You holding down north click
Gotta guy Sactown getting more rich
Life's a bitch but I'm a fucking raw dog
When it comes to beef I'm going overboard
I got grenades, shotguns and two nines
The world is mine, that's how I feel inside
Spit bars so I can get my rent paid
You gotta love it, we higher than a jet plane
Fly as fuck laced up in war gear
QB tatted on me, we all here
Sip beers, put fear in everyone
I know I did shit that you never done
Caught jux, robbed stores and all that
I'm not proud about it, dun, I need a cash
