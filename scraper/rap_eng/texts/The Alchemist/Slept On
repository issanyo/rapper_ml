Hey yo, my flow burns so hot
I cook like the coca
Boil-over scorch
Every soldier on your frontline
I'm wicked with the rapping
The sickest nigga on the drop
To bitches I'm attractive
I make that pussyhole numb
I'm good with shit man
Listen to the shit I say
It's PÃ©rignon the don, I pop like the bubbly
When I was doing bad, you people was all laughs
Assholes, jock off, kiss my whole ass
Mobocracy, live by mob rules
If niggas don't humble they self we eat food
Who possibly, could stop me, I ask
Perhaps niggas not knowing I be going ham
Mobb deep coming, put your woman in the stash
Hit a lick, whenever I speak it's straight cash
Hustle harder, go harder I must
450 km's on the gas

They call me big time, big beats
Big raps, I get big cheese
Little rappers, they get stepped on
They dreams get crushed, I'm not to be slept on
I'm not to be slept on
Keep dreaming, I'm not to be slept on

450 kilometers on the gas
Got a bad ass riddin shot gun on my left
Feeling like Bonnie and Clyde
Mallory and Mickey, she giving nigga top
Like she tryna giving hicky
She handing me the pussy like she handing me the blicky
Right before you curled up, on you curb sticky
And it's cl floated on smooth like the frisby
Man, what y'all niggas wanna do, you can't really
The boys get up but the land get bizy
Infamous empire state boy you top tippy
The tippy top spot yo we knocked u out yo supremes
Bright lights, dark streets, welcome to my city
The capital fashion girl we get spiffy
Fitted Mobb hats counting money like the machine
Niggas start shit we resort to heavy metal
450 kilometers on a pedal
They wanna catch me slip I move too fast
Internas P, check the numbers on the dash

They call me big time, big beats
Big raps, I get big cheese
Little rappers, they get stepped on
They dreams get crushed, I'm not to be slept on
I'm not to be slept on
Keep dreaming, I'm not to be slept on
