[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
It's like divin' out the plane
Once that music hit our veins
Tears of Rose Champagne
Mascara telling her tale
Revealin' her pain
She smilin' at the same time
She so high
We could live forever tonight
They'll never catch us, we'll never die
If you ain't scared to fly, it's rainin' outside
Ralph Lauren, duck boots, will suffice, slidin' high
Anita Baker serenaded my drive
Counted my first million dollars and I couldn't blink my eyes
Nowadays I'm used to it, I be smokin' while I do it
Crops is poppin' 'cause I grew it
On the flight, and I mack the stewardess
Writin' the truest 'cause I actually do this shit
Who it is

[Interlude]
You take some, you leave some . You never take it all
And what you get
They won't even want to get you
Police warrant, but guys get paid to shelf here
Everybody wants to get it, too
But if we do get a lot, no matter what, show you what you got to lose

[Intro 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Know what I'm sayin'
Can't drink, I'm just gone dribble on this muh fucka right quick
Ya dig?

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Ay yo, Bentley leather seats ready red
I do it like a Jill
She don't think the sex come with head?
I dodge a bitch like Neo
Pussy you ain't thuggin', you Huxtable nigga, you a Theo
Pyrex vision, pot got me pipin' hot, nigga, Tapatio
Me and Diego move like Frankie White and Cease-A-Leo
It's more than just twistin' your fingers up, and you deep with us
You ain't eat with us, you ain't sleep with us
Must of shot .223 with us
Pack ran outta Ack, nigga
You ain't never fiend for that lean with us
It was stomach aches, heartbreaks
Warrants off of missed court dates
Eviction notice, 'bout to call the county
Sent the rent about a million months late
White shit, now that's the type shit
That put a nigga in a murder mindstate
Roll a blunt and lace it with the girl
Got a nigga zooted in another world
Got the Toni Tone on the desktop like a Mac Pro
Mom and pop ain't really have the job to get me Lego blocks
So, I stacked dough
I went to my nigga Mac house and seen a one hundred thousand on the trap flo'
Got the strippers in here bustin' packs down, blow her back down
She a trap hoe
Got the shooters at the front and back do
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
