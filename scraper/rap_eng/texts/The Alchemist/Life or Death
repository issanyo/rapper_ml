Verse 1:
Hallucinates about a better life inhaling substances
His mother’s husband is abusive, he chooses evil accomplices
Syringe scattered floor in a broken bedroom
He wakes up chokin’ he loses hope he knows he'll be dead soon
Lucky to live to see another red moon
But he's ready as he moves to meth he knows that each breath will be deadly
The paranoia deepens, every sleep ends in nightmares
Freddy Krueger maneuvers he wonders how his life spares
Close calls, awaits the day he overdoses and falls
Suicide notes fill the walls when the thrill of drugs stalls
His mother and sister insisted he’s persistently twisted
He's pissed so his wrists are in slits the curtains miserably lifted
And on the stage is a teenager filled with rage to slaughter
All the figures he has but never had one thats a father
He's reaching his final destination destined for disaster
These wounds can’t be plastered and the next morning he was captured

Chorus: (Rakim)
Through my travels, i've tried to take righteous steps
Because right or left could mean life or death (x4)

Verse 2:
His common sense resents the present tense ran by dead presidents
He knows that heavens dense so he follows his evil precedence
The roof over his lucifer head is proof of his dread
He loots for his bread because the truth in hims dead
Addiction with a dictionary it distracts him from crimes
Relaxing he rhymes sits back spits facts sick acts from his mind
Begins to bleed and twitch he needs a fix
Greed conflicts his lethal tricks
Weetabix doesn't treat his evil ticks like his needle sticks
Intoxicated by a box of hatred his location slips
Bad relationships get Malaysian trips
His nose disclosed caucasian slips
His Potent Potential is stolen quoting the devil
Loading a level of lead loathing the life that he wrestles
Builds an urgency for an emergency exit
His life drifts away lips decay from the next hit
He was spitting propane but simultaneously sniffing cocaine
Stuck in two lines two minds eventually it broke his brain

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
Sinned a bit with groups of syndicates at adolesence
Adult lessons answer baffled questions, confessions to chapel reverends
Forgiven by god, but felt plunged in purgatory
Another murder story disturbed by words of gory
Friends with straight demons demonstratin trapped worlds
The soul they lived in was backwards as they began to act worse
The first to leave the blocks at speed
Became a cop in need to stop the greed
Pistol deaths, crystal meth and blocks of weed
Tired of wired shoelaces liars look with two faces
Contemplates retirement cause he inspires few changes
Thugs are unpredictable, quick to pull this life is cyclical
Lack of educated minds committing crimes are sick of school
Patrols the neighbourhood like a traitor would in a garda car
His friends grew far apart they dont understand his scars at heart
Laughed at his predicitions of convictions and death ends
Then came a case involving both of his best friends

(Chorus)
