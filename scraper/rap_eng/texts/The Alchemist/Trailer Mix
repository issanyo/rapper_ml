[TriState]
Willing these thoughts
Melodic art, darts counterpart shark
Fancy footwork frolic with funny old farts
Frylock snap, Kodak your Kojak crap
Cup spilleth over cognac rap
Slug pimpish, twistin' around to crack your princess
From a distance, alchemy reeks from my existence
Scientific tantra, blow a tantrum if she blowin' cancer
Only blow on this dick, I'm Jojo Dancer
Fire Pryor, higher sire in the fly attire
I desire something foreign color apple cider
Radiation botanics, chronic seeds planted
Aviation mechanics, I keep it fly granted
Embroidery boat coat, leather moccasins
Toast on account of this dope, Johnnie Cochrans
Mouthpiece talk a nigga out a roadster
Got bricks, couldn't throw a P in the ocean

[Killer Ben]
Master verb vertical
Circle slayer reversible
Purposeful all merciful
Tour surgical cervical
Pussycat, convertible top
Turn 'em a murderful
Telegraphic returnable
Debt sin is discernible
All it took was the nerve of you
Call niggas is Colonel
Kentucky Fried, Disco Inferno
Season the server
Buggy eye Benz rims
With fins ???
Sparkin' hymns
Black Moses gunnin' at your camera lens
Frostbit criminal sparkle
Butane flamin' charcoal
Live at the barbecue
Christian brothers to gargle
Far from awful to the fullest intensity
Bullets propensity
Aimin' for the dynamite density
Strikin' convincingly
With infamy, rotisserie dialogue differently
?? kissin' me in order to short circuit my memory
History tells me I'm graded the star's moon
Even man first element swallowed the dog diagram

[Phil da Agony]
My flow water like the aqueduct
See a lot of rappers comin' up and half of 'em suck
Stretchin' weed like laffy taffy
I'm like B.I.G. went from ashy to classy
Just pass me the dope chee'
I'mma burn a Backwood down to a roach leaf
Careful how you approach me
Might pull the wool over your sheep like Bow Peep
Creep like the Reaper do
Fillin' in the blank teachin' y'all how to substitute
Fuckin' with the class clown
Always doin' stupid shit sit your monkey ass down
Homeboy you embarassin' us
Diamond David Donahue on the cuff
Diamond in the ruff, plus
My nails' buff like Puff
You ain't heard of us? Tough!
You was outta touch

[Planet Asia]
Vagina ??
Remote control rune knowledge with nanu nanu
I pop a bottle with marijuana to solve my problems
The journal is paranormal nothin' is formal
These degrees is black Jesus in a pair of Jordans
Rewind this as I draw you up into fine mist
Durag Dynasty click
Block celly, pot belly boy
Gazelli frame, difficult thought bars
The block star, Beverly Hills King
Big screen machine gun 'gang
Sixteens for the cream I arrange
Middle of a war lean with a gauge
Half a brain shit, chemical balance
Kurt Kobain spit, ice cream banana clip
Examine it, he handle his
Demonstrate dope front of the camera lens
Distribution is blown from home team advantages
My narratives got me booked and countin' these asparagus
There's a difference between a full course and trailer mix
