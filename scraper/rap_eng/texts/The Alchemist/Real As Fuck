[Verse 1]
Hey you better watch your step
Put a hault in your quadricep
These killers are breathing a God-less breath
Or it feels like it
Cause you know how God is everything
It kinda hard to concentrate on that when you hear metal sing
Dont revel in medellin
Not really medicine
Deadly projections
Put plummets in your investments
I ain't catholic but i know the gripes with confession
I earned my stripes with some lessons
Via bouts of depression
I keep it low-key
I want to keep the power like Loki
Don't want to fuck up the vibes
I feel the good and its present
Dont be too low for the high
I blow smoke at these guys
But i use as a flashbang
To conceal weapons inside this rat race
Just incase it gets strange
Dont handle beef like your momma does
Thats is a mistake
Get chopped up like chefs salad
Yo how is that cleft palate
And hows that balance looking
After central booking
Im brooklyn as fuck
That sound kinda cliche
Rapper these days
Be more cheesy than
Philly cheesesteak
But you can be the cattle in this barbeque
Get left stiff in your poses, frozen like barbies do

[Hook]
Real as fuck
I can't stress it enough
I see that standards
Can't best them enough
Yall niggas acting so tough
Just keep real as fuck
Keep making your bucks
But keep faking for what?

[Verse 2]
There's some homeless niggas out there that are better songwriters
Give them some time in the booth, and they'll spit some Al-Qaeda
I'm so lit, I'm a born lighter
Bitch I'm a bonfire
Any niggas that hated on me
I'm making them all liars
These niggas look more stupid than Laura Ingraham
This a mismatch, click clack, u won't even hear the blam
For every plumber out there theres a Mario
Real cowboys bleed inside the barrio
You niggas are dickheaded
I got green like lettuce
Lettuce pray that your brain salad
Dont end up mourned on a ballad
Keep faking
You fans gonna leave
Like pedals when you rake in
What a fall demonstration
You a wall like berlin
Imma collapse ya
Imma a magician like Merlin
You better sit back bitch
Cuz this is that that attack

[Hook]
Real as fuck
I can't stress it enough
I see that standards
Can't best them enough
Yall niggas acting so tough
Just keep real as fuck
Keep making your bucks
But keep faking for what?
