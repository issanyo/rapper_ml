[Verse 1: Fashawn]
Trying to see millions in profits
And still be philanthropic
Drilling a Brazilian, as I chill in the tropics
Rockin', like I know Bob Dylan is watchin'
Acid tab for Jimi and Janis Joplin
Hard to get rid of me
I'm like herpes
Known to never show the mic mercy
I gave them content
They wanted controversy
Well, here you have it
Gladly causing the static
Equipped with a big dick
Clip for my automatic
Since back when gangsters still called guns ratchets
I personify a figure you idolize
Rimming in all flavors like HÃ¤agen-Dazs
Beggin' to give me top
Never been on a yacht
I left from right on the dock
Fuck yourself with a flesh light
I'm the reason jaguar made an F-type
It's Shawn

[Verse 2: Evidence]
A different wave on the same boat
Did not invent the storm
I just wore the biggest rain coat
Known to let pain go
Known for never same flow
I'm solvin' problems
I'll send the goons and goblins
Never involve a novice
Only time will tell
Only time a watch
Time will clock when confiding to this writer's block
Roll out the carpet red
Arrive like they knew of us
I'm solo in the diamond
Driving like there's two of us
Cause we ain't peace, don't mean it's war
Cause we underground, don't mean we poor
I pose a threat to any beat I'm taking serious
The words passed the margin, delivered with a period
Maybe paranoid, maybe Paris in the staircase
Floating on the high-end foreign airspace
I lift my mind to a rare place
A rare pace between the tortoise and the hare race

[Verse 3: Fashawn]
Straight up out of the gutter I rose
Ducking from po's
Chickenheads clucking when they see the duckets I gross
I'm rugged
Guzzling more
Bundle of dro
More product in production so the customers know I been pumpin
Bare face so you seeing Santiago
You can say I run my cartel like El Chapo
Don't papi look proper in the three-piece?
Stones in my cuff-links, kept the socks knee-length
I'm a menace with a ministry
Crawl through Venice like a centipede, I did indeed
I'm Pistol Pete when a pen in reach
It ain't all about the Benjamins, I been a beast
Never missing a beat, I'm in it too deep, filthy
Grizz is a thief, mission complete, I'm guilty
Of stealing the show
Realest to blow
When I die is the die I'll be done, dealing this dope
