[Verse 1:]
I ain't playing with you ass
Don’t call up and play with me

Even if I lose[x2]
We all know that Jesus should be everything
Even if I lose[x2]
How can we resolve this conflict
Even if I lose[x3]

[Chorus:]
I’ll make my own decisions
Even if I lose[x2]
The Christ
Even if I lose[x3]

[Chorus:]
I’ll make my own decisions
Even if I lose
