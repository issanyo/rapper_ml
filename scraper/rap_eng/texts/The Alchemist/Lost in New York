[Intro]
("All the animals come out at night
Whores, skunk, pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies
Sick
Someday a real rain’ll come and wash all this scum off the streets")

[Verse]
Hop off the plane, hit the baggage claim
JFK from LAX, watch the time change
A few hours, I’m half-sleep, feeling scatter-
Brained, bones aching, I need to stretch, hop the L
Train to the city, I heard the Chemist cooking up in the lab
Got approached by some niggas who be stickin’ up cabs
Said, “Ayo, where you from? Never seen you around”
I reply, “California, on my way uptown”
Somehow I wind up in the wrong borough
Surrounded by seven goons and they all thorough
One had a gat and he cocked it
Two was pattin’ my pockets
The other four sat back watchin’
Same night, met a chick in Lefrak City  with fat titties
Drove a nigga through Queens, we blew a pack of Phillies
Told her, “I’m trying to get to Hell’s Kitchen”
Told me she ain’t even from New York
Just on a visit, my head’s spinnin’
Need to sit and relax, take a sip of some ‘gnac
For a minute before a nigga collapse—made a call
With a couple of coins I had left, my Blackberry and wallet gone
Now I’m vexed—what the fuck?
How I end up in the Boogie Down BX, wanderin’ ‘round
Outta bounds, watch your step
I thought I heard a gunshot ring from the back of the ‘jects
Now I’m thinking: Will I even make it back to the West?
God-willing, I don’t get stuck in this maze of large buildings
A thousand feet tall in this field with odd tenants
Somehow I gather up enough change
To hop back on the train, almost forgot why I came
Take a look at my watch, it’s a quarter to 12
What a night, what a city, ‘nother story to tell
