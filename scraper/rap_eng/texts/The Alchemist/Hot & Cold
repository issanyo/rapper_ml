[Verse 1: Evidence]
Hot's a hundred degrees and hotter
Hot is stuck 0n rooftops in N.O. four days with no water
Hot's a sold out tour, #1 on Billboard
Hot could be that watch you didn't buy from the store
You ain't cold if you got no mack and step in the spot
And still leave with a girl who drop it like it's hot
Certain words flip, I'm on a roll...
If the cops watch you move bricks you hot, if you shoot bricks you cold
Cold is can't get arrested, cold's alone gettin' old
Cold is too much product on the shelf, nothin' sold
(Sometimes) cats are froze so cold they can't melt
Trust me, bein' cold's a cold hand to be dealt

[Verse 2: The Alchemist]
Yo I'm hot like the beats, heart cold like the streets
Hot headed so I never get caught with cold feet
Hot is brand-new Benz's, hot is runnin' from detectives
In the projects, hoppin' over fences and benches
Hot is camera flashin', hot is paparazzi snappin'
Hotter than a chain a motherfucker got from snatchin'
I never freeze when I'm in action
Cause if I cool off and hit a cold streak then I'll be a wrap then
Cold blooded ice in my veins, fuck the fame
Only cold stares, cold shoulders in this cold game
Gave me frostbite, I'm numb, I don't feel any pain
It's a cold world, I'm frigid, I don't feel any shame

[Hook]
You either hot, hot, hot
Or you're not, not, not
(What's our motherfuckin' names?
Better get it right, people better get it right)
"Evidence and Alchemist", "keep it hot"
You either hot, hot, hot
"Like the sun burn, burnin' down the block"
Or you're not, not, not
"It's so cold", "I'll leave em froze like ice"
"Hotter than lava", "colder than ever"
"Evidence and Alchemist"

[Verse 3: Evidence]
Cold's when the thrill is gone, cold's the good die young
Cold's the villian, cold's how wanted the cold chillin'
Cold's no love at the door, turned away when you roll up
In the cold, cold is no money for cold cuts
Hot and cold, that's opposite extremes
I think, which way is worse? Burn to death or freeze?
Hot's when you sellin' units, strictly word of mouth
We from the bottom of Cali, that's why the birds fly South
For the winter, copped a new crib, studio built in
It's hot, hot is not Paris Hilton
Tryin' to breathe, a cold world, inhale each breath
Still the sun can't chill but everyday the West sets

[Verse 4: The Alchemist]
Now who's the hot shot, up in the hot spot
With a big knot from sellin' hot rocks, duckin' cops on hot blocks
It's hot so you roll in that drop-top
The feds hot on your case, they run up in your place no knock-knock
Word on the street's somebody must have turned up the heat
Now you headed for that white cell and that cold white sheet
Better stay cool as a fan when that man say freeze
Or get your dome cracked, knocked out cold and need a Colpac
It's cold hard facts, I'm on the case like Kojak
Cold as a bitch that got a pretty face with no back
It's cold out, breath like a smoke cloud when I blow that
When I finish rap I'm quittin' cold turkey so quote that

[Hook]
You either hot, hot, hot
Or you're not, not, not
(What's our motherfuckin' names?
Better get it right, people better get it right)
"Evidence and Alchemist", "keep it hot"
You either hot, hot, hot
"Like the sun burn, burnin' down your block"
Or you're not, not, not
"It's so cold", "I'll leave em froze like ice"
"Hotter than lava", "colder than ever"
"Evidence and Alchemist", "turnin' up the temperature"
