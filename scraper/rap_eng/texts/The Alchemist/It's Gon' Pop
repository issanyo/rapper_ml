[Verse 1: Evidence]
Went from Bourne Identity to Bourne Supremacy
These cats are little ornaments that fall off eventually
Good or bad, every time I rhyme, they wanna mention me
Thorns in my side are just pricks, a waste of energy
Call me what you want, ain’t phased by my title
Believe a notebook, I’ll lie on any Bible
I’m gassed by the game, never starstruck from stardom
Went uptown and found Heaven up in Harlem
In NY but in the L.A. zone
Still wherever I roam remain L.A.’s own
Peace to Madlib, Wildchild, DJ Romes
Got my clothes and loot packed up ready to go
This blackout, never back out type anthems
We blam them, the logo’s for life, understand ‘em
We stay at this, it’s target practice
Judge the cover and the book, motherfucker, it’s the total package

[Verse 2: Joe Scudda]
I’m ‘bout to give them the best of me
But you ain’t seen nothin’, y’all don’t wanna see the rest of me
Homeboy, I got the recipe on lock next to me
I’m the future, what they sayin’ the best could be
But it’s best to be cool with me
Y’all don’t wanna really fool with me
Yeah, you better off acting like you used to go to school with me
‘Cause you a square like them cubes in the cooler be
As I said, I ain’t even reach my full potential
Still I stepped in the game with full credentials
Stars on the collar, stripes on the sleeves
Remember when I used to spend nights in the breeze
Sleeping in the car, speaking into bars
Joe got right so now I’m weakening your odds
Y’all dudes lames and names equal out to frauds
Y’all ain’t men, you bitch, better get your bras
So you could hate, I really ain’t concerned
Say what you want—when will you motherfuckers learn?
I don’t listen to shit that they tell me
Got the Evidence, Joe fucks with the ALC

[Verse 3: The Alchemist]
Yeah, I put the stamp on it
Got the game in a lock, I put the clamp on it
I’m going straight to the top, I’ll bet your camp on it
Put grands on it, then proceed with the plans on it
Any cash to snatch, you know that my hands on it
The fans want it, any stage, I’ll stand on it and jam on it
Yeah, just me and my man on it, no band on it
Jump in the crowd and I land on it
Signature style, I’m burning my brand on it
The way I cook a track and dance on it
You don’t wanna chance on it
Make a move or make an advance on it
Don’t plan on it, I cancel it, and leave you to handle it
You like my style, I see done ran with it, I’m the man with it
I don’t break the beat down, I fuckin’ dismantle it
I savage it, damage it, bruise it and bandage it
I shit on it, piss on it, stomp on it, stand on it

[KRS-ONE] “Well, let me respond
What I wanna do is jump across the table and beat your fuckin’ ass
That’s what I wanna do
That’s what I’m about
So what’s up?”
