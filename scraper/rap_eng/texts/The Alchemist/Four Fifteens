[Intro: Jay Worthy]
Yeah, niggas already know what it is
Big motherfucking Worthy, yeah
This shit real
One time for my nigga Yams

[Verse 1: Jay Worthy]
Raised by niggas who was major in the 80's
Brought us up brazy, [?] babies
Taught me what I know and now I let these hoes pay me
Hopping out the 'cedes, pull up know we gang deep
Hanging out with some crips but all them niggas know I gang P's
Thugging under palm tress, my bitch resemble Blondie
And I'm like fab5 top had [?] meet
Take her out the function, niggas order but they not me
A real pimp, some hoes just won't deal with
Break her til she broken and then I fix her up and still get
Money out that pussy, now that's what I call a real bitch
[?] poolside make me feel rich
