[Verse 1: Sus Boy 3000 (pizza boy.)]
It ain’t death and taxes, it’s stress and sadness
Discard your totem, better invest in talismans
Evil up here, horror clips on loop
So push ya’ tee up, show some heart; you gon’ see where that malice is
I am what I say, I mirror my tongue
I’m Kobe or sum’n; you think that you can hold me, you’re wrong
You think you know me, you wrong; your shit can only go wrong
Drop you in the middle of the night just like an OVO song
I ain’t playin’; update your fuckin’ Flash plugin or somethin’
Just understand that I ain’t dealin’ with no fuckin’ assumptions
I give you me, up close; personal pan pizza
Kool-Aid on the side when I burst through your damn speaker
OH YEAH! … Bitch
Breakin’ the walls down
Chris Jericho; Lionsault; these falls count anywhere
You’re plenty scared
Run up on you in a Denny’s chair
I’ll kill you in any booth; ain’t no kisses there

[Verse 2: Big Sus Boi (Shampoo Papi)]
Sus Boyz like Trading Places
Now stand back and catch my amazing graces
Too bad like a dog that's racist
Too Sus 4 TV like Amazing Race is
Taste it, savor it
Choco Taco, ooooh my favorite
Big Sus, who the fuck you playin' with?
Hungry like the wolf or a fuckin' vagrant
