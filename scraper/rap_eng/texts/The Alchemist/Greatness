[Hollow Da Don]
Bullets whiz by, arms clip, hit thighs
Think this a picnic then get your ribs fried
Bullet this wide… gun this size…
Get chest Tietze:d… with a TEC-9…
Why are you a issue that I wanna push
When I got choices like Master or Bubba kush
You can smell it hard through the whole room
It's like a cartoon: you can see the whole fume
Car go vroom… star go zoom…
What stop is next? Well far go noon
In you're home by two, give a hard cock
She treat the balls like Halls: that's cough drops
New years she lick the balls when the ball drop
Then cook pork chop (where?) in YOUR pot!
All Glocks, 4's pop, boss stop
Nigga you ain't got a gun like a mall cop
They all stop, try to get photos
In the jig Polo, the big logo
I'm the bomb, and the pin is out
Killed 'em at the In-N-Out, nigga I was in and out
