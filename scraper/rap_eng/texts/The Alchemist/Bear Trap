The merriment of others had me fucking salivating
Case and point being that joy was so close that I can taste it
Call me Pavlov, dog. I tried to pass along the missing link
But failed for I fell victim to his classical conditioning
Recently I feel my foot is stuck in a bear trap where I gnawed my paw off for freedom out of despair that if the hunters come and find me, they will harvest my guts
Now I have phantom limb syndrome after giving out trust
It's just another lonely day at the races
Where I shout until I'm hoarse into a mic with no cables
To the light with those angels where the tunnel-visions painful
And the focus won't break on this child whose gone wayward
And we have gangster rap to thank for that. Been damned since the days I was playing in pampers
Leaving chance to dice rolls, When I shake them, get amped up
And with patience I don't have none like sway with answers
It goes ring around the Rosie. Pocket full of pose. Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I got beaucoup trust issues and a flask for love
But listen and drink it in before you're quick to pass judgement

Begrudgingly I aim toward satisfaction if it kills me
Under molten rocks I've lifted to find emptiness a plenty
Then a friend told me that my rain cloud is temporary
For her words are my preserver which float me above the cemetery
Moonwalk past contemporaries without waving
Paving ways to use for later exclusively as a save point
Esteem redeems drawbacks so long that it is high enough
Dreams where teeth fall out leave cold sweats when eyes are shut
Minor scuffle or a war. Be mindful what you're fighting for
The spectrum begs the question "is the altercation affordable?"
Battle price tags can vary though they may not seem it
What you came in with likely won't be what you will leave with
