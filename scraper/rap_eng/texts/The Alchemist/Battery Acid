[Intro]
Aye, Kiss! Man, come holler at me
I'mma rip your track one time, man
Ain't nobody fucking with me

[Verse 1]
Smoke a bitch nigga, light him up with the same gat
I flame back, leave him right there on the race track
I'm on the same track mind state, where my frame at
Nigga wanna ride but I told him to lay back
I'mma knock his head off, dumping the lead off
I'mma pull his cap like he taking the tag off
What a nigga want, money or pussy?
But, you already pussy with a little bit of money
Bulletproof with the rap, you ain't taking it from me
Rob suckers in the hood, gimme all of your money
Broke rap nigga, ain't shit funny
See straight at the top, I be off that dope
Get dope off the boat, still push them notes
Got crack in the soap, pull it up like ropes
You don't gotta sing a note to understand my vibe
I ride up with them killers with them all chrome nines
My gun like a shoe cause I stay with mines
Blew his head out his ass, don't waste my time
Looking all over my shoulders while I slang these boulders
In my hand like controllers, still control it
Tell 'em send it right there at a moments notice
See you bitches choose up, don't forget who chosen
I just let 'em sit back and realize I'm God
I bag zips up, start to feel like Shyne
I ain't one of them niggas that be out here lying
You faking like a jail nigga
Tell in the cell, what he did on the outside trail
Real niggas don't snitch, man, we just post bail
Don't go to jail, cause that's way too stupid
Niggas move foolish, teenage clueless
I understand why you spend all your money at jewelers
You face game trying to look it up like the super
Clean, I'm on the computer, got dope stuffed in the computer
Like I'm a mac sitting on the back, don't trip, two gats, hah, lay 'em flat
BasedWorld, nigga. I ain't got time to player hate
I used to sell bus passes and tote guns
That was covered in acid, my whole gun steel but the scope is plastic
Shoot up in the crowd, man. I'll leave 'em tragic

[Outro]
Lil' B, aye, this Illusions Of Grandeur part 2, ya feel me
I'm talking about, you know, if you ain't fucking with that real shit then man, fuck it
You know, like, niggas going down in history, man
If you ain't fucking with history, I don't know what you talking about
Lil' B, man. BasedWorld, we keep this shit rocking till the end
Yeah, man, this based for life
Aye, Kiss, I see you, man
What it do?
