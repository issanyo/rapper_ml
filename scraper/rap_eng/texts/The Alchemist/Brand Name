(Top to bottom)
Fly shit

[Verse 1]
Midnight oil burning
Bouillabasse with London Broil stirring
Making all the lawyers nervous
You fake like soy burgers
You was hating on the lord weren't you, waiting on a short circuit
You played your hand too quick did you
Could've made a couple grand a hundred gram but you a bitch nigga
They say my shit too hard school
It's the type of shit you do at least a thousand dips up in the yard to
Back in the county on some fuck shit
Fucking with you next thing I knew shit was cracking and now we on a bus trip
I need the diabetic trays with the orange
Got the hypertension trays for the tre-8 in the morning
Three peanut butters for a bump of chips
I know you niggas seek love that's common sense
My tolerance is high for price
Not offended by what you pied pipe
My mind on the slice wild life
You got your rhymes on the mic
I got my classmates doing time, 25 double life
Parasites be trying to slide up on your boy
That's why I'ma need that 85 Bombardier vibe on the flight
The flight attendant suck dick
The flight attendant got a fat ass
The flight attendant fuck chicks

[Hook]
Brand name fire
Brand name safe
Brand name star
Brand name space
Brand name
Brand name with the car
Brand name place
Brand name car, black car
Brand name AK
Brand name with the broads
Brand name place
Brand name gods
Brand name gods

[Verse 2]
Bushmaster muzzle break
Wilson suppressor your du-rag
You push back your other face
Snatch some bullets out the rubbermaid
18 gallons of blue tang, your crew had to andale
Watchale way
We be the drug war veterans too
Salute, that's what brothers say
That's why I had to look the other way
Fuck a Tony Montana, I'm the other way
Just like Sosa
Throwing feds off of helicopters for my culture
I was just chest-naked in the trap
Breaking down molder in the bathtub, relax
Haiti flag on my face
Two cannons on the flag on my face
One drum on the flag on my face
36 dums on the flag on my face
Fuck out my face
