Verse 1 (Generale Q and Loe Pesci back and forth)

Pesci can't believe I'm a threat to these rappin tricks
I herd your doing a mixtape with the alchemist
He knows you from your battle shit, yeah he does but i jacked the shit
How you mean, you ain't chopped, screwed and resampled it ?

Actually, happened is ...yeah yeah you talk a lotta shit
Who's hosting this tape, Can you even afford a drop from him?
Nah im just jackin for beats I let the sampler sit
I tweeted ALC for a drop but he ain't answer yet

Noticed you were missing the touch of a woman's vision
The ones that have a hit, all swear to god that they how baddest bitch`
You switch like them, you show your ass and tits
Rappin bout sex is the the kind of thing the masses dig

Why's it gotta come to that? I'll turn this into battle rap
Hit with you some punches & kicks with the fitted hats to match
I love this bitch...save your fantasies for another chick
You ain't touchin this, (I discovered you) you ain't discovered shit!

First off Im the one who's trying to get us fucking rich
And shut up bitch if I made a move you'd have loved the shit
Who you callin bitch? (you) lets get in the boxing ring
Youd be like nah let's settle a peace offering

I ain't apologizing when it comes monetizing
You tired of 9 to 5'ing rather make them dollars rhyming, right?
25/8 till the finish line mate, Combat boots
And jacket 22 to your face

Stop switchin subjects, got no budget and sex sells
Extentions and french nails = cover of XXL
You should fuck with your friends help
Go get us some profit, next time you spit bars
It better be some Nicki Minaj shit

Hook X 2:
Who are you to be giving me industry lessons b?
You really there mentally or simply obsessed with me ?
This studio's expensive, if you splitting the rent with me
You can sit here and lecture me bout artistic integrity
