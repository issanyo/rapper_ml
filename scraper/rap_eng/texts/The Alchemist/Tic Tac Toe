[Verse One: Danimal Lector]

I run this shit, yo, so hit the road
I'm sittin' low, slurpin' on that sizzurp, ho
Switch up with the pick 'n roll
You little trolls
I'm a wizard with my grip on the globe
I can switch from slow, to ridiculous flow
In an instance, bro, easier than Tic, Tac, Toe
It's more like, click, clack, "Nooo!"
I got a big bag of dro
Some zigzags to roll, and a six pack, lets go
Time to kick ass, I know
I'm ready for it, definitely bored with
What I'm hearin', your best recording's
Less important than my next dentist appointment
I reckon you best stop messin' with the nest of this hornet
Or I'll be collecting your organs, like Dexter Morgan
Or send them to Oregon, or somewhere else that's foreign
I've been drinkin' more again
But bein' weird is kinda normal, man
I'm sort of an alien, born with a cranium
Full of an assortment of insane thoughts, kind of hard containing them
My wife's been complaining I'm too weird
Why?
Cause I'm drinkin' a root beer, with a fuckin' huge beard
Aww shoot, dear
I'mma go do a number two and write my name on this new mirror, with the poop smear
You're dull as used shears, you ain't makin' the fuckin' cut
Knife in my grip, I'm like "Might I assist? Wassup, wassup?"
Drunk as fuck, giving tummy tucks
Minus the part where I put you back together, you must be nuts
I'mma eat your guts for lunch
As I puff a blunt, you're such a dunce
I'mma uppercut your mother in the cunt
With this rusty gun, and bust it when she cums
Sounds disgusting but, fun
Troublesome since I was young
For a couple months I was good, only once and I was one
I said fuck it son, cause life's shorter than Danny Devito
The Danimal we know? Straight wildcat like Teebow

[Verse Two: Tantrum]

This ain't new to a trained student
A crazed lunacy, straight ruthless
I make moves of deranged cruelty
With great fluency
When it's time to arrange eulegies
You'll be prayin' to not be in the same room as me
My heart isn't cold, it's cryogenic
Tryna' step with a violent threat's
Like givin' a Burn Notice to Michael Westen
The kind of vengence that fights ahead till your life has ended
With any kind of weapon, from striking methods
To pyrotechnics
You won't last, I'm beatin' your troops with tactical schemes
I maneuver you, passin' right through your clavicle, seekin'
My crew to battle's like dealin' with supernatural
Creatures with moving mandibles, feasting on human cannibals
That means I'm above the top of the food chain
Touch my comfortable spots is what you're not gonna do, mayne
I don't care about a lucky shot at a huge name
I just kick ass then brush the blood off of my shoe strings
