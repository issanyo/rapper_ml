[Intro]

[Hook]
I'm hazardous
Homie, we don't play around
I'm hazardous
I don't fuck around, do what I tell ya
I'm hazardous
Crazy, violent, times of the...
I'm hazardous
Homie, we don't play around

[Verse 1: Oh No]
I'm in your vision, I'm the first stop giving you intuition, listen
I'm the premonition, enter your system
Fission, I'm in your bloodstream
I'm in the kitchen, chillin', I'm like a thug's dream
Massive addiction, power me is convicious
For the cream, I seem to be always in conditions
Going deep is religion, my rituals and traditions
Homie, I'm just a menace, get written for a sentence
From all the judges and cynics
Find me up in the back of the club in the drug appendix
Only here for the lifted
In the air that you're sniffin', smoke and inhale the difference
I'm the pill that they popping, that needle injecting sickness
Feel the fire I harness
I burn your soul with that pure, ready to harvest
I'm the proof in the product
Study by green professor so I enter the college and slums
And where the garbage is, point me to where the target is
You'll feel marvelous

[Hook]
I'm hazardous
Homie, we don't play around
I'm hazardous
I don't fuck around, do what I tell ya
I'm hazardous
Crazy, violent, times of the...
I'm hazardous
Homie, we don't play around

[Verse 2: Alchemist]
It's the Toxic Avenger
Body parts shredded in a Cuisinart blender
Seasoned art vendor, build a beat, it parts Jenga
You sick turpentine and keep his feet on a credenza
Sunday morning funnies with a bowl full of Frankenberries
Dope engine, dirty syringe all in your capillaries
I am a magician, I am Amazing Larry
I made a steak from your heart, it tasted of cake and berry
(Ooh, that's sweet!) Hurt my teeth, now I got cavities
Cut open the Duracell, sip the juice straight out of the battery
Feed me beats, your boy lost his marbles
Mr. Cheeks Jamaican dance on a face with the cleats
Jacket made of flesh, got the blood on my leather Chuckers
(Ahem) Clear my throat then I spit the phlegm in the muckus
Turn a party to ruckus
Limbs that been severed, they get discarded, a buck is
Split apart all the ducats
What!

[Hook]
I'm hazardous
Homie, we don't play around
I'm hazardous
I don't fuck around, do what I tell ya
I'm hazardous
Crazy, violent, times of the...
I'm hazardous
Homie, we don't play around
