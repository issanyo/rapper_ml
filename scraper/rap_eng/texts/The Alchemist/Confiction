(Verse 1)
The blind now have sight
The deaf could speak
The truth turns the outspoken people to meek
Conflictions with my belief
The reason I'm losing sleep
Was cautious to speak my peace
Cause you sow what you reap
No longer a sheep Third eye wide open
No more sitting wishing hopin
And tossin and turnin
Brain cell burning and evil thoughts lurkin
I can't sit through a sermon
Would I still exist if Mary would've stayed a virgin
Confliction, not to mention contradiction
Knowledge brings power and addiction
The absolute truths horrific
It could all be so simple but its complex
Could've been a scientist
You'll agree just analyze this
Ignorance is bliss until you fall in that abyss
And mother nature start to hate you cause you called life a bitch
Sight the myths, they the ones who powerless
Millions made in the church, but they told me god's a gift
(Don't lose em)
If yo raps sick my shit cancer
Scared cause you don't have the answers
The street lights fire dancin'
We inside hell's mansion
I'm surrounded by the brain dead
Talking to brick walls
From the bank of knowledge I made withdrawals
Hard to be sure until I see him come to me on sandy shores
Arms stretched walking on water, Heavenly father
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge

(Verse 2)
Air polluted with religious confusion
Search for solution theories no longer unproven
But ya'll won't listen if I speak on the movement
You continue to be foolish
Your life gone end at your eulogy
Serve white for whitey all your life give you cell as gratuity
OG you'll never be
You see 18 the age Trayvon ain't make it to see
It could've been you, It could've been me
Threats in pursuit, Hands up and still shootin
Feel like Huey Newton, Hope I'm heard from Hong Kong to Houston
I just want one listen, You don't know fact from fantasy
I'm confusing fiction
