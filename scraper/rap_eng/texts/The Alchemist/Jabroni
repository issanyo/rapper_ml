[Intro]

[Hook: Quavo]
I growed up lookin' up to wrestlin'
I found it was fake and started hustlin'
Momma told me if you put the muscle in
You gon' make a lot of fuckin' millions
Call it M&Ms, M&M, M&Ms, M&M
You gon' make a lot of fuckin' millions
Call it M&Ms, M&M

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Chinchilla on, it's a hundred degrees
All this ice on, body on freeze
Came up runnin' from the police
Now I got the M&Ms, I tell the pig freeze
Remember bad bitches used to want me spendin' cheese
Now I'm on TV, I get the pussy just for free
And I like my money straight no perm just for me
If you try to catch up with me, yeah I'm out your league
Went and copped the Lambo just for the speed
I took your hoe and had to put her on her knees
Row your boat, her mouth is water like the sea
The pussy got me sea-sick, I need some Dramamine

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset, my dreams was drivin' the Phantom
In reality I was just trappin'
All the robberies and the kidnappin'
It's a dirty game, you need a napkin
When you got millions, they'll try to assassin
When it come to music, got a passion
We legendary, not the average
Takeoff

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
All of my niggas had dreams, I put on my Louboutin, in red carpet scene
On the block, tryna' make some work, had to sort the fiend
Had to pick the pot, Billie Jean
I was a regular nigga, now people call me a celebrity nigga
Walkin' around with the M&M, M&M niggas
They call me a decimal nigga
Feeling like Peter Piper walkin' around with 'em peppers
I might go and pet me a nigga
Pull up in the Bentley with bulletproof windows
Migos sellin' out the Staples center

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
My homies told me stop being modest and stunt a lil'
Cause most of these rappers just rap, and they never touch a mil
I'm just being honest, cuz God, he done made us prophets
To profit, no other option, my pockets is on Uncle Phil
Bitches audition for me, I keep her runnin' drills
Ain't no controllin' these hoes, the dome is mentally ill
Death to the enemy, ain't no rest til the death of me
Got it locked, penitentiary
Money mountains, Beverly Hills
Woah, it's Mac of all trades
Anything you all need shit I have it all day
It's big cash small change, goin' fast in all lanes
They was sleepin' on me, but I got 'em Adderall wake now
There's no denying me, bonified fire every time I speak the champ
One man dynasty, walk
Why you so sensitive, feminine
I've arrived, let me in motherfucker
Gotdamn

[Hook: Quavo]
I growed up lookin' up to wrestlin'
I found it was fake and started hustlin'
Momma told me if you put the muscle in
You gonna make a lot of fuckin' millions
Call it M&Ms, M&M, M&Ms, M&M
You gonna make a lot of fuckin' millions
Call it M&Ms, M&M
