[Verse 1: K-Mars]
Whenever i feel broken
I pick myself up and remember i was chosen
To be here
Yall need me in the game like a motherfucking token
Soul so golden
No dope smoking
Keep mind open
These rich fucks got karats/carrots but they still blind
Gone through so much and im still fine
See colors as i listen to this instrumental
Yea i was born to be trippy
But i was never born to be tripping
Dont you think they should make an astral being emoji
Oh sorry that was my mind rambling again homie
Nevermind ima keep going
Happy with the views i get even though im not famous
At least im on somebodys playlist
I dont go with the system like a fucking game disc
Dont feel our societies lawmakers
The truth is a knife and the lies a jawbreaker x2

[Chorus]
Said it ain't any drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
Looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
They up above keeping watch till im dead so howd i get this red dot on my head
So howd i get this red dot on my head
