I heard a chant we going back home the other day

Happiness is something you can’t buy
Real true love can… (Repeated)

Real peace one day I’m sure you’ll find

Oh yeah

Real true love can… (Repeated)

Real peace one day I’m sure you’ll find
Joy, you can get it, boy, anytime

Real true love can… (Repeated)

You can find it if you… (Repeated)
You can find it if you try

Real true love can… (Repeated)

Amen
