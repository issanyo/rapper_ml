[Verse 1: Havoc]
Around my way the shots sound like [drum sound]
Shots sound like the drum roll, them streets is dumb cold
Even in the summer though
Niggas can't handle the truth or they don't wanna know
The shit is gory close your eyes pussy
My history documented, kept a nine in my hoodie
Graduated to the fully, we was goodie
It was money over nookie, that went without saying
Mommy never let us leave the crib without praying
But y'all playing, your verse wasn't worth the paper
That it was written on, the fuck is you saying
Not much, let me have to get the ducktape
Fuck the world, I'm out here try to make another race
Whatever happen gonna happen, we just living life
Amongst the walking dead, looking like they died twice
I kept it hood like the fried rice
Too dark to get a tan from the limelight
It don't effect shit bitch but the pockets getting bigger
Hoes getting thicker, pour mo' liquor, roll more trees up
I'm about to go in, watch a nigga roll the sleeves up

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Anybody disrespect Hav or P
Get their head cracked open like a coconut, seen
Get your dome sprayed up like Coconut Sheen
At the barbershop, line niggas up nice and neat
Get splashed open down to the white meat
Down to your jawbone, break my razor in your cheek
I rap awfully good but when it comes to beef
I leave you on that New York strip real saucy
This is bloody sport hiphop, no nursery rhymes
And when P arrives on the set it's burglary time
Understandable smooth shit murderers kill for
We dropouts who took life and shaped it how we want
I mold this bitch into a success story
Protected by the power of God, I stand before Thee
Now who wanna rhyme, who wanna challenge the man
That rock that bandana rap like Gangland
