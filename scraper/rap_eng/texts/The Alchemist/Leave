I would leave, I would leave
If I could I would [x4]

I'm grinding my teeth
Through my face
It's a hell hole

Stumble through the streets
In my head it's a hell hole

I would leave, I would leave
If I could I would [x4]

She's drunk and she's cheap
In this place it's a hell hole

A liar and a thief
In this place it's a hell hole

I would leave, I would leave
If I could I would [x4]

I would leave, I would leave
If I could I would [x4]
