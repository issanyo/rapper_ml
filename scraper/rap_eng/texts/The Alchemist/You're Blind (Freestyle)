[Verse 1:]

Everybody shootin' guns
So where the bodies at?
Everybody out [?] niggas
So where the [?] at?
Somebody lied
Lot's of chain's
Snatched in the city last year
But ain't nobody die
Lot of drugs sold in the city last
Year, I be floating round here
You ain't seen a rapper with a
[?]
I say I got [?]
Everybody sellin' bricks
I just settle for the lah
On top of the game, [?]
[?] off to the trap with
[?]
I hustle for survival
You just out for the play dough
I make more (why?)
Because I'm in it to win it
[?]
[?]
Bitch to fuck my brother, she
Wit' it then she get done
I spend just as it comes
(thats fast as a muthafucker)
Young'in copped a bag
Like a muthafucker

Hard [?]

Attached to a tech

You're Blind, You're Blind
