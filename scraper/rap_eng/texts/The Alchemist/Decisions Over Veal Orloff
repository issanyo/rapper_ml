[Method Man and Redman Sample]
...and have a blast, ayo

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
It be that Queens kid with the face of Jim "The Anvil" Neidhart
I play the part, smoke the white shark
My mind sharp like a shape up from Dominican's
There's no confession, when I'm sinning fucking cinnamon women
Rocking double colour linen from the beginning
I see a lot of youth's pretending, better watch who you be befriending
My shit's profound, I shoot the pistol with the whistle sound
And catch the shell before it hit the ground
Then peel off just like the skin of the pepper
Or the jacket that I'm rocking, cause I'm twisted in leather
Don't get it twisted, keep the biscuits hot, chickens and cheddar
Getting fly just like the shit with the feathers
You could be laying face down if you so choose
I leave you covered in the blanket, man, you old news
I'm from the place where kids'll shank you for some cold shoes
Half out the pocket with the hanky on the boat cruise, it's me
