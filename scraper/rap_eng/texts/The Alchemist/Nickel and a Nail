[Intro]
This is one of those ones, you heard
Alchemist, what the fuck is the deal
It's that gutta gutta gutta gutta shit nigga
(Yea Twin I see you) With my little dirty niggas

[Prodigy]
That nigga P is thug enough to rep QB from Long Island
Hempstead niggas thug their way to the top
Man as a young gun I was like they can't stop me
Now I'm all grown obviously they ain't stop me (Nope)
Tried my hands at drug that shit wasn't for me (Uh)
Compared to these royalties that shit is like chicken feed
Some chose ballin', music was my callin'
As long as it sounds gutta you hear me all along
What most make in a year, I get off one song
And that shit is not fair to you, but fuck y'all
Man I'm still comin' up on that rough side, that tough side
Nuttin' was handed to me, I had to go for mine
My shit is hard earn, you stumbled onto shine
We built this from the dirt, you copy off mine
Once again it's the homey that thug rhymes and kill beats
Niggas is burnt, they runnin' out lines

[Interlude]
Ha-ha-ha, nah nigga don't ask me for shit
Nigga don't come up to me (The fully loaded .25)
(With one extra bullet on the side)
You don't want what I got in my pocket nigga
Do you really want this? Do you really want this?
I got somethin' for you, come here, check it out
(The fully loaded .25, with one extra bullet on the side)

[Prodigy]
That nigga P bug enough to bring my gun, where's that wildin'
It's too much cops there, chill P you wildin'
Fuck that I've been too much to start calmin'
Down now seen too much to start fallin'
Off my gun game, niggas is retarded
Won't catch P, bucket, naked, without my pistola (Nope)
Like Adam in the garden, it's beast out in the field
And apples ain't shit when you're starvin'
Time for me to run 'em up, pardon
I'm overly aggressive with life, you too soft man
I'm doin' what I does best, you try to block me
You'll get knocked down try to stand where I rock please
Don't force to pop these shots in your frame
Leave you blood clots in the brain
And that's not suppose to bleed
How you gon' pull through with them hoes and your bee
(Nah, he's not gon' make it)

[Interlude]
The fully loaded .25 (Uh-huh, you see me nigga)
With one extra bullet on the side (You see me nigga, what nigga?, what?)
The fully loaded .25, (Want that?) with one extra bullet on the side (You
Could have it)
All I got in my pocket -- is a nickel and a nail (What else?)
The fully loaded .25, with one extra bullet on the side (Uh-huh)
All I got in my pocket, (What's that?) is a nickel and a nail
(And what's that?) The fully loaded .25, with one extra bullet on the side
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, nickel plated .25)
