Upside down shots, do the strikeout game
Now let me explain to you what strikeout is:
Take a hit of the weed, inhale it, hold it, chug your whole beer, then take a shot of some vodka or some Bacardi, Henny or whatever
Then you blow the smoke out
Now I am not the drinking champion when it comes to that
My boy Jason took my title
[ad-lib: N.O.R.E.] In the strikeout game
And he's well-deserved because he had to go to the hospital that night
[?]
Rest in peace Jason
