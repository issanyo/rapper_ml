[Verse 1: Conway]
Ayo, started with a quarter two weeks later copped four Os
Diamonds G bundle, every day before the store close
(Just) pray I find a connect to import those
Bricks of pure snow
Straight from the cartel, Lord knows
Send over a thousand birds
You in the station, writing statements 'til you outta words
Gave 'em the whole run down
On the pussy niggas that we gunned down
Lord please forgive this fuck nigga somehow
He knows not what he do but I'ma give 'em the drum now
Most you niggas done now, washed up
Tellin' stories how you used to get money but you a bum now

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, three stamps get you a soda
Same chef in the mess hall used to chef up the yola
CLS's in every color
I crashed the money blue joint and copped three others
My magazine on fleek, 60' rounds lift him off his feet
My hightops got red soles, dome shot leave your head blown
Mac-10 or the Mac-11
Doctor stressin' tryna put you back together
So many 12/12 ends I can sell crack's forever
Hand to hand for new Margiela
Walking over bodies, I'm godly
The Ace of Spades sipper in the pissy lobby
