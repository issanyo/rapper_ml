[Verse]
Profoundly Speak through clouds of weed
My element gold, Mastered Alchemy
Drastic habit for knapsack raps, assure you my head ain't That Kinda Jagged
Candid African Rhyme Javelin
Savage cannabis ashing
Thanks to Alan now they blasted
You need good luck If you placid
Overlap what you ran, bitch
Don't share a level, get it how you living
Studious to crucial lessons, Lemons don't see medals, it's a given
Don't talk unless I get commission
See everything triple twenty vision
And don't love these bitches
Renounce the fiction, hoard the figures, fuck a limit
Couple pearls of wisdom
Better look and listen, pick my diction like my women
Fuckboy hunter, Lucius Landa prowl
They drown in shit they watered down and soon they'll quit kicking
When a lord reigns it's purple pouring
Smoke a wreath, call the fucking florist
Me and my demons we stopped warring
Now me and losing is discordant

[Hook]
When I drop, ascend
Put in context
I'm just complex
And I'm still fucking young, Prom sex
When I drop, ascend
Put in context
I'm just complex
And I'm still fucking young, Prom sex

[Outro]
Fuck an up next
Fuck Practice, I don't double check, bitch
