Fuck

My high ass squished the woods man i bet i would
I bet i turn these raps , backs n facts into racks
I might double back just for the sake of the attack
And i might bun a Q to shed a tear for my past
Reminisce on what ain't last and say thanks for what i had
Yo this life is like a race i built my future off of who i passed
Nowadays i'll grab a O for me , though i'd rather see a P , but y'all still sharing Qs in them swisher sweets
So second thought i'm happy and i'm highed up and i'm laughing
If i ain't tell you where i get it then just quit askin'
Hate to not be poppin' they begging just for attention
I'd kill for first place y'all get the honourable mention
Slipstreaming through dimensions i don't need affection you fall flat just like a bungee jumper jumpin' with no tension
Skydiver with no lesson, no parachute no protection
Don't get to second guessing he could be pressing at yo section
And that's no speaking in my session you might interrupt a blessing
You don't stop a doctor on the job but what's yo question
How i do it, abuse it, i kill it but make calm music
Y'all got that con music cause you stealin' influence
Cause you stealin' influence
Bet you stole that surfboard that you ride the wave with
I make lame muhfuckas walk the plank on my ship
Go take a dip sleep with fish no beastiality in this bitch
What i am to rap is what a blue rag is to a crip
Chips to dip, straws to sip, and gold chains to a fit
I could micromanage the whole game just with some tips
Now who really got the drank up in the city cause i'm feelin' sick *cough*
