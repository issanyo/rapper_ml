[Bridge: Evidence]
From the time I ride out until the time I’m home
I pray for a safe travel, God, while I’m gone

[Verse 1: Rakaa]
Overstanders vs. overseers
Overseas or over here
Classic overachiever holding class for non-believers
Hold your pass at will call, biggest giants will fall
Lightning bolt your ear like LT but this ain’t football
Mid-city magic, it's parades after the rat race
Wreck the grand marshals, buffet until they stack plates
Sparking martial arts, heavy metal on the podium
Head spinning like Caesar, no cardboard or linoleum
Breaking history out the freezer, finding future where the seeds are
Roll with Jesus types knowing these lights can cause a seizure
Downtown Skyline 'til the plates shifted
Big brain-teaser scriptures moving major motion pictures
Put the night to sleep then I rise and wake the morning up
Study the Queen Calafia, California
Sprinkle holy water, blessed oil anointed, some rap to spit
Some would say a circle is pointless

[Hook: Rakaa]
Live from LA River Drive
Where some are happy enough to know they're getting by
Where some are at their lowest when they're getting high
Where others try to wake them up and open up their eyes
Where the cold streets are warming up
Put the night to sleep, when I rise wake the morning up
(Put the night to sleep, when I rise wake the morning up)

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Evidence]
They watch our moves, every step becomes the cinema
With cameras in the street lights, the city life I live it up
Only my notable moments are here for quoting
The rest are over
Gone With The Wind, it’s like the cold is blowing
But fuck it, the pen's in motion like my Venice Ocean
Like my city done switched up but I'm still devoted
I ride the coping out, my reputations spoke about
A Westsider killing 'til I'm paid in full and bills are folded
Damn, it's nothing new like, this the cutting room floor?
Picking up a scrap or two less and break the rules more
So who’s up for being up to something?
Used to being nothing
Used to be confused
But ain’t no future in yo' frontin’
Times is hard as fuck
Like back then when the carter struck
I'm talking new Jack
And not a new rap or some artist, look
I been different from the coast of the Pacific
The shit is scripted
Just directors with a vision

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Sick Jacken]
Every morning that I get up
Wake up thankful that I wasn’t set up
Blessed with another day so I bow my head and shut up
Cause anything can happen on the streets
It don’t mean I’m out of reach cause I’m rapping over beats
Ask B.I.G., ask Pac, ask pigs, ask blocks
Disrespect, ass drop
It don’t matter if you have props, enemies I have not
So I don’t gotta deal with this
Been able to avoid the drama cause I kept it real with it
Disregard the negative cause all that shit is relative
Sedative with Dilated, Alchemist is editing
Rep Los evidently, it’s good to be home
A microphone, some moonshine, and I’m in the zone, it's on
Concrete and palm tree, constantly we're off beat
Everything I saw today determines how the song be
All around the world with this so you can say you saw me
And if you didn’t know, Double-S got an army like that

[Hook]
