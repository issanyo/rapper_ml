A new millennium group a revived last battalion


Destroying rappers at God speed no emcee can't top me in this city sentences predict the future the verdict is clear to see that I breathe this penmanship, a pencil thats lyrical, blessings
I blessed this city with just my presence united many savages hazardous energy
Raw density, and that's including me, predict the future vividly like Nostradamus reincarnated nastradomus a don prominent and still be monstrous power level skyrocketed, over 9000 super saiyan    insanity, God level what i planed to see, I feast off enemies like alucard. son
My past is what scarred from, made me rawer, same bitches stay on my balls son, sick like aids I need medical aid because I lost it fraudulent with beat and rhymes I'll be devine, have niggas read my lines like bible verses in my prime, I'll take the time I'll blow and bust up just like cum, you bitches all my sons
I'm kidding stop the bitching no disses a vision, no one listened now witness it,  I flipped the script tales from the crypt, I resurrect this present of hip hop all just with my wrist, I'm ripping shit until I sprain it my victims remain nameless I'm saying so stop hating or you'll end up like my patients I'm vacant

I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
