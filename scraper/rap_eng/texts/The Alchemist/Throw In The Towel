[Intro: Havoc]
Ah, yeah
I got that H on my chest

[Verse 1: Havoc]
I'm doing my 1,2 and giving ya niggas no chance to squeeze
I'm putting the drop on 'em and burn 'em in all degrees
They falling like autumn leaves, I'm rolling up on my sleeves
It's over, just take a kneel, who the fuck you supposed to be? I'm a threat, I'm a threat
I got 'em so tight I can see their heart beating through their chest
I'm a monster, every mountain climbed, I done conquered
Fuck about your jewelry unless it's all Tonka
I smell like a bakery, all bread, no pastry
If it's never making cake for me, no risk, no reward
Your bitch like a ornament, she hanging from my balls
Nigga do his number, all a sudden it's my fault
Y'all still on the runway, no lift off
We in the air, y'all pissed off
You don't want our paths to ever criss cross
Cause like a dinner plate, the guns is nicked off

[Hook: Havoc]
My nigga it's over, you can throw in the towel
I know you hear the growls, I know you hear the growl
The more money made, the guns just got louder
I'm aiming for the power, their faces got sour
I'm screaming from the tower momma love I made it
Momma love I made it
I'm screaming from the tower momma love I made it
Momma love I made it

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Yeah, you just a temporary fix
Every rhyme that I spit on some legendary shit
Hold my dick on stage, then hit the crib
Bless every room with the tree smoke like it was sage
Heart full of rage, only way you in my circle, we gotta be on the same page
If not, got to throw you in the pit
Had a lot of fake friends, son I been over this
Like beating a dead horse, it's the same old shit
Y'all halfway, I'm letting off the whole damn clip
Anybody in my way getting steamrolled
Flattened, H.A.V. done reload
Keep firing, y'all need more people, y'all niggas all lying
Y'all jumping out the pan, to the motherfucking fire
It's down to the wire, your shit sounds tired

[Hook: Havoc]
My nigga it's over, you can throw in the towel
I know you hear the growls, I know you hear the growl
The more money made, the guns just got louder
I'm aiming for the power, their faces got sour
I'm screaming from the tower momma love I made it
Momma love I made it
I'm screaming from the tower momma love I made it
Momma love I made it
