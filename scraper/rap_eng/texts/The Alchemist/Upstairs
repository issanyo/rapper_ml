[Verse 1: Rakaa]
Yeah
I seemed to drive you crazy, memories are hazy
Physcians sling prescriptions cause they're greedy and they're lazy
Now our roles switched, heart breaking as it is
We both miss who we were, frustrated how we live
I admit at times, I can't help but feel ashamed
For the fury and the tone of the truth I spit in flames
Venting in infernal fires, hard to keep contained
You brought lights into the world, out the ash the phoenix came
Love that came from war, change your language and your name
Then came the disrespect of your brain and your frame
A outsider, living in a land so strange
But I know for a fact you have the strength to beat the pain
Whispered you were sorry, I found you that way
How far away the siren sounded that day
Violence in my chest, pulse banging in my ears
Percussion of the Calvary, running up the stairs
Confused you with every question
They looked at you with judgement, like maybe she learned her lesson
Then the oxygen mask, then the field testing
All of us were on our knees but I was praying for a blessing
They asked for your language and name
Then came the disrespect of your brain and your frame
Didn't even try to hide contempt, with no concern
They snatched you off the carpet, then strapped you to the gurney
Scared, embarrassed, then mad
Please be careful, YO BE CAUTIOUS
Of Fairfax traffic, block to Pico
I floated back upstairs, feeling nauseous
Thinking back to the farm where demons can never follow
O'ahu near Honolulu, Bawa manalo
Amai iki but really Aloha and mahalo
Nuiloa ukuloa, I could inherit some of your sorrow
I can't sleep either
Dreams too extreme
Eye lids, eyes closed, IMAX movie screen
If I did drift off, my body would do this thing
Where I'd get stuck with my mind away but couldn't move a screen
Stream of consciousness running through the L.A. Zoo
I also understood more about you then you knew
After decades, a part of you were still a child confused
That barely made it out a makeshift home and so without her shoes
You saw a party turn into a riot for my crew
And smiled when the crowd went wild for Babu
Pride was in your eyes but really I was proud of you
When you made it upstairs, center table, House of Blues
From the Far East to South Central, California
To the castle off of Crenshaw by the palm trees on Victoria
Darkness to the dawn more chapters to the story
You're a blessing, not a burden
I love you
Cause you're a warrior
