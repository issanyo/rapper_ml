[Verse 1: Evidence]
If I never started 'til now, then this would be a great time
To run back to first, to the last, to retrace lines
And at the same time, pace myself, the marathon runner
Underneath your feet the ground out from under
I’m restricted from any rules or boundaries
And if they try to bounty me, I counter 'til they out of reach
I don’t lose, I win, so let the record spin
Let the record state who I don’t recommend
My people been here so I don’t state the obvious
I overstay my welcome and probably killed the ambiance
Fuckin’ up the promenades at any events
I rock the poker face, hold it up, and close it intense
I’m over the fence, I never look back to catch feelings
Never caught it hanging in my many dealings
I kept their hands up to many ceilings
Playin’ for pennies, I made many millions

[Hook: Psycho Les]
Let me remind y’all, all my little sons
And for y’all haters, two big middle ones
Y'all ain't fuckin’ with us; two big metal ones
You poppin’ shit? Two big metal ones

[Verse 2: Psycho Les]
Ayo, suckas wanna play me like a breakbeat
Spinning on the Technic, I had to take a leak
When I speak, you don’t speak (shut up), you just tweak
Like a cokehead, broke with no bread
Tryna sell me a broke moped
You could go 'head with that
Tell Dr. Phil 'you gots to chill'
Every minute of the time is a dollar bill
And I ain’t gonna stop 'til I got a mil
By the way, your shit is so boring
I started snoring...while you were recording
I woke up and went and bought the new Jordans
Oh, it’s funky-fresh, overseas tourin’
Drop a beat and make you shake your backbone
Get the money and take it back home
It pays the bills, it pays the rent
And when we perform it’s the main event

[Hook: Psycho Les]
Let me remind y’all, all my little sons
And for y’all haters, two big middle ones
Y'all ain't fuckin’ with us; two big metal ones
You poppin’ shit? Two big metal ones

[Verse 3: The Alchemist]
Stare at a G, it’s what it be, mami
Push an obese body, smoother than spreading butter on a bialy
Or burning lemonade haze, call it Chi Ali
I’m filthy, I take a shit and wipe with a Versace
Fuck the fashion
I swing the ax like I’m chopping wood for a cabin
The world is mine for the grabbin’
Polyester jacket with the dragon embroidery
I float like a rubber duck with mad buoyancy
Suicidal tendency, how dare you direct your pen at me
I am devastated, I am appalled
Umbrella’s made from the wings of a raptor, the pants crawl
The lizard slippers, the gecko, the eagle jacket is bald
Rare species outfit, you ain’t about shit
Van Damme, karate kick your face and leave your mouth split
Blow like a bucket of cow shit
With the plastique, God forbid we ever meet on a back street
Du-rag look like a black sheep

[Hook: Psycho Les]
Let me remind y’all, all my little sons
And for y’all haters, two big middle ones
Y'all ain't fuckin’ with us; two big metal ones
You poppin’ shit? Two big metal ones
