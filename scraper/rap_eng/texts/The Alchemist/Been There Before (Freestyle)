[Intro]
Ay
I'm tryna tell ya, i been there before
Can ya feel me

[Verse]
I know how it feels when you deep in love
And the one you love ain't as real as they seem bruh

They say they love you, but then they turn back on ya
Point the finger at ya sit back and then laugh homie

And even though you keepin' it real and keepin' it true
Even folks on your team, speaking evil of you

And now you sitting meditating and constantly contemplating
Why in your life does it seem you only see constant hatred

Tryna figure why is it the ones you love and hold close
Eat you up and spit you out and then leave you in the cold

They leave you hanging like a rag on a clothesline post
Then they knock you down with the quickness like you got clothes-lined yo

It seems no matter what you doing all you gaining is pain
So you figured man just forget it, I'll get use to it man

Cause it seems you'll never enjoy what other people enjoy
True love from the ones whom you love and adore

You tired of dealing with homies who seem real but really fraud
And taking chances with dames who you later learn just play with hearts

You feel like you can't make it and tell the Lord you can't take it
But it feels like He ain't even listening so you retracting your statement

I know the pain that you feel, I know the hurt that you have
I know you think the good times you've already had is all that you'll ever have

And when folks try to motivate you, you close your ears and your mind
Cause it seems they saying the same thing every time

But don't let those who hate you, belittle you man
You can make it and I know it cause I been there man

[Outro]
Ay, doing this to let you know...
I been there before....

I been there before.....
