[Verse 1]
It’s all about respect and pussy
Cash is tertiary, laugh with the mercenaries left ‘em bookies
Thought they was raw, so we left ‘em cooking
Michelin stars for cheffing, target testing where my weapon pushing
Water whip it like a whirlpool
My nigga how the fuck you mentioning shit up out the Red Room?
Heirloom tomato sauce fish, that’s that jail food
Devils and Angels don’t mix, that’s that fail proof
You never put 17’s on a Civic
Niggas never tried to kill you for a V or digit
Get shot for half an ounce in Vailsburg, or cop the chrome
Pop a loudmouth, pinch off ya block and sell work
Where I'm from a 9 to 5 is not much
Regret no homicide or you’ll die brushed
My wallets got fucked
Bounce up
Like my nigga Eric Buller
They give you 31 years for nothin’ like my nigga Eric Buller

(It’s all about respect and pussy)
(Cash is tertiary, pussy secondary)

[Verse 2]
This is Scott wave, dirty Carhartt wave, you're not saved
Jesus don’t love you, Hommy rub you in the wrong way
Say, you niggas is inside, we improv
Bet your little monkey ass sigh when your friends die, bye
Set off a chain of events, hop off the bench then, Detlef Shrempf
Six man with the end, I'm him
Dish pans with the wrist I win
You won’t know when
All you gon' hear is bang when I go in
(It’s different)

[Verse 3]
He went from flipping big bags of bleach, the shop with Big Sherl
The 50 shot top, load the yoppas with the magazines curled
Multi methamphetamine pills
He took the boat ride, got the pigeon with the bitter green stills
Scripts get filled in the ville, you get chills
Python boots on the feel
Lou got woo with the Krug with the steel
That nigga Boots get food in the mail
Y’all niggas is cute, we shooting then we hooping for real
The Dragon and Medusa
I had the Ruger matte ill
Versace belt deadstock self includes the entails
