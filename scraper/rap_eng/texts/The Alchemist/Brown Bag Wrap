[Verse 1]
Inhale the mystical, the blue shit
See me on the stoop shit, act stupid at the park the ball get roofed
Baby see the cops, the drugs she boofed it
Foie gras at every meal, that means I triple goosed it
Soon to see me in the coupe kid
Bust a nut produce an athlete or a doctor
Singer or a dancer, blunt is filled with cancer
Shorty think I’m handsome, but she don’t know the half
I’m holding up for ransom, still rock the Helly Hansen
Gortex boot, enter the vortex boo, I’ll give you raw sex
You’ll awake next to the horse head, true
Drove the Corvette, she snort that, her corset blue
I’m the enforcer, six of my mans got to toss that too

[Chorus]
Smoke a 50 bag, and do the dippies on the gypsy cab
In '95, rock the same shits that Griffey had
I spit the shit to make a bitch that say she Christian gag
Like the youngins say, motherfucker this is swag
Brown bag wrap the beverage in the street, to hide it from the heat
Half a lion on my feet, well now you see me down under diving by the reef
The Wagyu domesticated, wilding with the creeps

[Verse 2]
The floor is marble, flow inside the foyer
Shout out to the lawyer, far from goyim
Like a London broil, pull the cannon let the slugs destroy ya
Always fighting with my baby mama, love you Toya
Pearl white Boston coach, that’s a classy toy
Take your bitch and tag team her, Nasty Boys
I’m from the armpit, the stinky part, smelly like a pinky fart
In the water biting bitches, kinky shark
I got the doobie rolled, hash brown like a booty hole
Watching Oklahoma City at the studio
The barber spent an hour just on my shape-up, get your weight up
540 flying like a grey duck

[Chorus]
Smoke a 50 bag, and do the dippies on the gypsy cab
In '95, rock the same shits that Griffey had
I spit the shit to make a bitch that say she Christian gag
Like the youngins say, motherfucker this is swag
Brown bag wrap the beverage in the street, to hide it from the heat
Half a lion on my feet, well now you see me down under diving by the reef
The Wagyu domesticated, wilding with the creeps
