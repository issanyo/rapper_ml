[Hook]
In your gods, you got faith
Please don't talk about losses with us like we know how does that taste
Please don't lie to my face
I can feel a lot of energy around y'all
So please don't die, do not waste it
You no high, you guys basic
Please don't lie to my face...

[Verse 1]
We ain't gonna rest now
Fuck how hard a man's task is
There's plenty of room in a casket
So we ain't gonna rest now
And we ain't gonna slow down
Appetite for destruction, that's nutrition
How my brotha raised me, if a nigga wanna get it, gotta ban a lazy attitude, mothafucka
Ehhhhhhouiiiiiiiiii
All these rappers are my kids, feelin' like a Black Ewing
Steal the crown just like a bandit
Ain't no newcomer, understand it
I'll be conquesting all the land, it's not even that hard to get, I'm the biggest layer on the canvas, fucking all your standards
You don't even the fuck this man is, he don't miss, he sippin to your losses like his second name was Memphis
Crossing over all your niggas like NCIS
Your roles models are I, myself and me I guess
Turn your backs to your roots
Throwing all your fake facts to the youth
Claiming that you're stack, that? need a proof
I X I we the highest squad we high as sky, you ain't fuckin' with the gang gang
Or the clique clique, bout to throw a wack wordplay, if you play with the clique, they gon' flip, that's a gang bang (that was shit..)

[Hook]
In your gods, you got faith
Please don't talk about losses with us like we know how does that taste
Please don't lie to my face
I can feel a lot of energy around y'all
So please don't die, do not waste it
You no high, you guys basic, yah
Please don't lie to my face..

[Verse 2]
I feel like God will give it cause I asked for it
A million of locations on the dashboard
I'm eating competition all around the globe, merging food stamps just to keep a pretty passport
That's delivered by the power and the juice
No I don't really think I need an escort
No I don't really think I need some burdens, all these humans all around, I'm still gonna get the best score
Killed the game, I admit it, no effort
All your lies never gonna last forever
Your whole life is banter, man I'm staying higher, never land, guess I have to change my name to Connolly yeah...
