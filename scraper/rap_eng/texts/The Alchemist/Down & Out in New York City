(Sample from Down and Out in New York City)

[Verse 1: James Brown]
I was born in New York City on a Monday
Seems I was out shinin' shoes by Tuesday noon
All the fat cats, in the bad hats doin' me a real big favor
You got the fat cats, in the bad hats layin' it on real good
When you're down and out in New York City
I said I'm never never never never gonna get that way again, ooh
