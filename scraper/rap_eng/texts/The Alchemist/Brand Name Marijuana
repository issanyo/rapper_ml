[Hook]
Gangster level, take the stones out your bezel (what)
Shank the devil, Gucci sneakers on the pedal (what)
Loud bass light treble, heavy metal, no guitar
Forever been a rebel, never settle
Mosh pit shit when I spit, it’s still rap though
Same type of rush when my gat blow, waddup though
G shit, all my niggas did it, don’t count cash before you get it
On the day before you live it

[Verse 1]
Back to the basics, Cris cases, big faces
Servants ride dick, my side chick’s a thick waitress
Rotating Breitlings on a day to day basis
Everybody gotta go but I can never die tasteless
Abrasive green sneakers red laces, fuck cages
See niggas buck gauges, rocking Nikes with state bracelets, what
It’s too much drama in this world that we know
Sold drugs for 10 years but you got nothing to show
I’ll never be that (never)
Catch me where the money and the weed at
Blocks with Glocks pop and stripper bitches getting skied at
It’s sorta like my life’s an after hours party (sorta)
We used to roll together, now my niggas speaking hardly (fucked up)
As we gettin older, some of us be getting dumber
Maliciousness and jealousy, don’t guide your thoughts with hunger
Fuck around and get left on a back street
You pussy niggas faker than rap beef, waddup though

[Hook]
Gangster level, take the stones out your bezel (what)
Shake the devil, Gucci sneakers on the pedal (what)
Loud bass light treble, heavy metal, no guitar
Forever been a rebel, never settle
Mosh pit shit when I spit, it’s still rap though
Same type of rush when my gat blow, waddup though
G shit, all my niggas did it, don’t count cash before you get it
On the day before you live it

[Verse 2]
Rap apostle, eat falafel in the brothel (what)
Behaviour wasn't docile, never gossip, that’s the gospel (what)
Brutally honest, kicking shit that you could bop to
Prisoners of character, your reputation locked you
Niggas is too scared to hustle but they too cool to work
So they walk around broke like a motherfucking jerk
All I know is hard work, money, and dedication
I come from Queens providing fiends with basic medication
Hustling and scuffling definitely part of my education
Shrewd lavish pescatarian with food habits
Fresh water fish gets placed on top of nude cabbage
True savage, you average, dad we superior
Old crime stories decorated my interior
Keep it live though, it’s all about survival, fuck the 5-0
Provide blow, eating fra diavlo, rocking fly lo, my bio, Laurenovich waddup though

[Hook]
Gangster level, take the stones out your bezel (what)
Shake the devil, Gucci sneakers on the pedal (what)
Loud bass light treble, heavy metal, no guitar
Forever been a rebel, never settle
Mosh pit shit when I spit, it’s still rap though
Same type of rush when my gat blow, waddup though
G shit, all my niggas did it, don’t count cash before you get it
On the day before you live it
