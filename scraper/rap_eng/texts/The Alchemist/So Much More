[Sample]
"I wanna be more and more and more
So much more more more more more
So much-"

[Intro]
Shit says Japan, France, Austria, Switzerland, Philippines, Germany
Uh the other side say
U.S.A. what’s that- Great Britain, Norway, Canada, Sweden, Korea and that shit say on the back all the time
That shit say World Tour, on the back

[Verse 1]
Yo
We had to bear crawl from Hell we never heard of you
That’s what we on as far as I could tell
You might as well be cervical
Wally’s was burgundy
It hurt to see you rock the China Coogi
I rock the Australian shit assertively (come on man)
Only time we Gucci when you dead and when I’m flourishing
Everything, crisp when I finesse with all currency, thoroughly
No money no honey man, you know

[Verse 2]
Khloe heart teared on OG Bobby Johnson face Courvoisier
Dumyelle, Griselda führer rob for Maison Margiel-
Con Air, whoever thought one day it’s sectarian, I’m there
Whoever brought the statement stake you, god damn
Y'all been the weightless, not to bake to shake that I’m in
Lozenge, and throw a ace of spade when break the broad in
Amen
Nimrod ting, only
Still

[Verse 3]
I thought you knew that rotten fruit was like the sweetest
You thought these boots was rockable, but this incomparable
We volatile, we not va-ginas (we not vaginas)
We copped the beamer
So fuck your Lex, Cooper S fever
We come to get through with less features (big time)
Get ethered, Swiss cheese the whip, the crot with tall being
No frequency without the all seeing (uh huh)
She Korean, mixed with moumoune
She beg for me to stick my dick inside her, life the webos
I might raw dog
I heard she burning like Charizard
She shot the boy squirtle at the plaza (plaza)

My lil homie Doe got shot up in the Benz like Pac and Eric Buller doin' 31 years, what kind of friends I got?
L shot his baby moms’ in the face
My cousin Ted had so many
I think the stars lit his way
Fuck
