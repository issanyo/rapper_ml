[Verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]
I spill like petroleum boats opium blow
My slogan overdose emotions like emoji in phones
Napoleon quotes on podiums spoke sold out show
Can make a sniper rifle fold out of my wallet and go
It's a wrap's been a fact finna smack the benefactor
Send it back with the cash in the package and then I tap ya
North east south east got mouths to feed
Avoid unnecessary beef that's more cow to breed
Nobody else looking out for me looking for Houses to purchase
Without a care in the world u got a 1000 nurses
Mountains worth of hearses Berkshire Hathaway
Shots fire birds fly away it's my way or the highway
John woo scene Mujahdeen self-confidence of two Ali's
My will power made me who I am that's a black eye pea
Catch more than just a black eye when fucking with me
Buckets seat up in the vee I don't hustle for free
U begging labels for a push I can unplug ya machine
Don't be caught sleep  shit can be costly
Closing deals behind the scenes  catch games on the floor seat
Sp 500 close a 500 thou fly to London Without funding doing loud numbers
You threw the towel fronting I dropped a song got the Dow jumping
Teachers said I would amount to nothing

[Verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend]
Nobody love u until everybody love u
When they making money off u everybody love u
F' u ain't making no numbers in this world kick rocks
U know u buzzing when these chicks start blowing up ya inbox
Till they start calling you for favors and verses
People in and out ya crib now the neighbors is nervous
Fake pages and impersonators trolling u out
The music biz was doing bad I sold em dope in a drought
Looking happy when u see me what u joking about
Baby here's something for u to suck love open ya mouth
Interviews with stupid questions like how u got into rap
Everybody's into rap so why u asking me that
The money changer with one in the chamber my stomach
Grumbling from hunger pains  case u wondering
Case u wonder bout the passion in the bars that say
It's part of me I put my heart inside the cards that I play
Didn't graduate from Harvard or Yale but still I talk well
And I keep talking my talk long my talk sell
I “lol” to the bank making deposits
Extorting corporations for bank shaking they pockets
Clock it I'm a hotter than a terrorist watch list
Cash flow is emirate Arabic logic
A dream that's American moved from Maryland up to
Brooklyn then I made it must mean I'm something special then
