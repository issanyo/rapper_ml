Verse 1:
Once I got my first job I was geeked up
Working 12 hr shifts, I couldn't keep up
I don't want no day job, I want this job
No down payments, just sound payments
New speakers I took it from my momma's room
I love music, I don't love these prostitutes
Men this college life, it's really just a substitute
What I hide behind this smile, men its nothing slime
They be yelling JB, yea he running life
2 fingers to the sky, PAC, Thug life
It took me 18 years, I got my first dome
I thank God I was raised in a good home
I was just a virgin then but it was all good
I didn't need nona that, I was knocking wood
Remember when I rock the durags, fake chains
Now I'm rocking button downs, look how things change
Celtics SnapBack on, like I'm Danny Ainge
Pimp My Ride, new chrome wheels candy paint
And we here!

Hook:
Ain't no body fucking with my entourage
I buy real flowers, these dudes getting prom corsage

Men these dudes really getting on my nerves
I'm getting better now, only I deserve

I'm bout to blow up quick, I got the urge
Please don't I-block my shot, no serge

Ain't no body fucking with my entourage
I buy real flowers, these dudes getting prom corsage

I got the Internet going crazy
Men these new cat JB, he wavy

Verse 2:
I been rapping for 14 years, I want success
JB at his Best, Look how I progressed
I apologize for anything I sold you in the past
Do yourself a favor and throw that in the trash
This that good shit I'm spitting now
Sound so prolific now
Couldn't put the mic down
Beat it up, Ike now
You could ask my assistant
I've always been persistent
Over a 1,000 rap books, homie I've been missing
Now I put it on my iPhone, call me the technician
Magic music making, Call me the magician
King James baby, I'm back on a mission
Tryna get that 3 peat, haters stay wishing
On my downfall, but I could tell y'all
I ain't going down like that
And we here

Hook:
Ain't no body fucking with my entourage
I buy real flowers, these dudes getting prom corsage

Men these dudes really getting on my nerves
I'm getting better now, only I deserve

I'm bout to blow up quick, I got the urge
Please don't I-block my shine, no serge

Ain't no body fucking with my entourage
I buy real flowers, these dudes getting prom corsage

I got the Internet going crazy
Men these new cat JB, he wavy

Verse 3:
From G's to Gentleman, that rapper Riff Raff
I can't believe he got a deal, men so whack
That's what the haters say
But you just gotta give respect where it's due? And I do
All these rappers paved my way, And I back in the stu
Laughing straight to the bank, Haw Haw Haw Haw (voice memo)
Hottest MC in the game, Kendrick Lamar
I'm up in my room, that's gotta be me someday
50 Cent my favorite rapper, Get Rich all day
Me Zainab and Mariam we was in my parents room
Watching Bet Videos, now I'm in the Studio
Chingy Right Thurr, men I was right therr
I was jamming like no other, religious like my brother
And we here

Hook:
Ain't no body fucking with my entourage
