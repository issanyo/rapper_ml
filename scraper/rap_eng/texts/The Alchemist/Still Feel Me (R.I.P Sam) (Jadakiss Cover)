(Intro)

Yo R.I.P Sam you ain't die for no reason

Linden , Farmers , Murdock..... 200


(Verse)

It's been two years my brother
Since we lost ya
Who knew petty beef in the streets
Was gonna cost ya
3-20 a week before my b-day
When I saw that body bag I cried in the worst way
He was from Brooklyn
Always stayed in Queens
Fresh Jay's , Yankee brim , Tavernitti jeans
He was a good dude
Always liked to party
Remember that summer
You was drunk pissy off Bacardi
You and Rob go back like Atari
Met you in 07 when I rocked Ed Hardy
Justin parties LMF did it up
Yall graduated school and the whole group split up
Meelz and Kay cooling
Yusef still hopping
Rob still trooping
You know 116 still su-woo-ping
Don got older
Little hair on his chest
D-Rod got a job He's a Bronx EMS
The hood got hood after Hamo got shot
He could of lived if the cops let him leave the block
They got it out for us
Ima make it out for us
Road to the riches no GPS the route is tough
Now a days I just stay to myself
Focus on my goals , music money and health

I'm gone....

(Outro)

Thats why y'all gotta still feel me. Yo Rob whats good Meelz Kay Yusef whats up we still here. We gone make it for Sam
