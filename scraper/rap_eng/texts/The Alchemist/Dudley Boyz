[Intro: Action Bronson​​]
Bam Bam!
Queens, it's me

[Verse 1: Action Bronson​​]
I peel steel shit like string cheese
River Monsters playing on the big screen
I've been flickin' knifes since I was 15
I'm just a kid from Queens, nothing don't mean shit to me
Victory, my life is like a breakfast at Tiffany's
M5 sounding like a symphony
These people jealous cause no motherfucka sick as me
I bag 330, 40 home runs, 137 RBIs, 50 stolen bases
Hold this face lift
I should have bought a bracelet
I guess I'm old, impatient
Time is of the essence shorty face it
I all-suede everything, spaceship
Put your pussy right here so I can taste it

[Verse 2: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, shot him so quick I forgot to put my gloves on
Bullets soundin' like our love song
Roll him in the Persian rug
Soon as the buckshots hit 'em he started coughin' blood
Neighborhood tracksuits, but you ain't ran shit
Pistol whip him so hard, fucked up his dandruff
Kicks too plush, the Public School's nubuck
Grenade launcher lookin' like Manute Bol
Searchin' for loopholes
Fell asleep in the law library
Me and LaRusso
Get the knives from Julio
Buck the nigga if he move once
Black still in the hole he got 14 months
Work from the DR she stuck it in her cunt
We back, flip 1000 packs, relax
Last Kwanza we bought each other Jags
Mines was all glass, skrrrrrrrrr!
