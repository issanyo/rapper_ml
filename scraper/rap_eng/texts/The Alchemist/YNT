[Hook: Prodigy]
Got 16 on the hip
Pretty little things in the whip
'Bout to take a ride, get lit
Episodes of some young hustlas, we thuggin'

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Get it higher 'til my head pop
I keep my soul deadstock
Never bought, often imitated, life is still a bitch
You gotta strip her naked
Do more than just give and takin'
They send me haters, I exhibit patience
Smokin' reverations, act a donkey off my 40 acres
Snortin' life into my worries, numb their faces
That's your dream, you better fuckin' chase it
Passed the fuckin' phase
I'm stuck and at the almost made it
Still confident but never been a favorite
Those Complex Mags say that I'm underrated
I take it, and try to make it into ambition
My new position
Is in my view with each of you that listens
See my vision turned to fruition
Say my name, I'm overdue for mentions

[Hook: Prodigy]

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Nigga if you ain't ready to make a body drop
Then get out the car Trey, you don't need to ride
I'mma find these niggas and take 'em real far
Deep space, they be sleep for a while, dig it
Henny remix, a pinch of MDMA
Nigga came in saucy, left out shitty
Cause I brought the 3-5 out the house with me
At the periodic table, countin' Benji's
Nobody talkin' to me, nobody takin' pictures
You a fan? Name a song on my new album
And buy my shit, you dummy motherfucker
I'm not these other niggas, a mandatory rap listen
Got mami with the gun up there
In pussy wrapped up with saran wrap
Clap through then I boogie to the next episode
Like my nigga Nate Dogg
Through a 40 bottle in the air, then break y'all

[Hook: Prodigy x2]
