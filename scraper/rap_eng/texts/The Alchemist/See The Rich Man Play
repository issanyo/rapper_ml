[Verse 1: Alchemist]
Scheming on a watch
Dreaming on a yacht
Background sounds of ones jingling from out the slot
Thinking on a plot
Drown my face until the bar close
Two months late on the rent plus the car note
We all purchase
Man without a purpose
Wood circle wrapped in velvet
While I watch the chips slide across the surface
Cards on the table watch the facial expressions
Turning nervous
...All I want is a taste
Got dealt a nine and doubled down
All I need is an Ace
Seem like the bottom of the bucket is my home base
Born to lose while I watch the work circling the room
Bitches pass, I get a whiff of the perfume
It's like I'm laying with my back on the street
A little money get me back on my feet
Sit at the table put me back on my seat
Digging in my pocket all I felt was my jeans

[Verse 2: Evidence]
How I paint it
Dim light, dark pic
I was slumming and my love is tainted
The edge is rough and covered up when I frame it
Base it I called it dream and others chase it
Its a pine box and nine lives crossed up like weed strands
Crossed like cross hairs
Cost, his keys paid
Special ops on the scene he's a bee ?
Attach the honey keep my money in the briefcase
With not a comp for me that's nothing when Im easing to get lost
The seasons nothing when I'm feeling grim
Peep as they dealing him
Knowing I am not yet boss
It's a ceiling I do not get
Often when it adds up
Coughing when they roll the dice
? I am bad luck
In Vegas too playing Miles Davis Bitches Brew
Same day but the wish is new

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Life of a gambler
I play my hand with candor
Tip the vic dancer
Lit the cancer
Kiss the tarantula
Switch the pamper
It's banter
Glitz and glamour
Whip the Fisker
No need to shift the Phantom
The tandem
Male enhancement
The sex is tantric
Perfect the gambit
Protect the King
Play the harem
It's heaven
Roll the seven with discretion
Impressive
The necklace
Make the peasant toss the lettuce with the French Dressing
(I walked in the Casino)
To add the jet to the collection
Fresh glass of nectar the refreshment
Popped a mescaline in like a breath mint
Benevolence
Diamond elements
Million dollar rhetoric
Remy Martin spill on the carpet
Twist pelicans in crisp garments
Triple lemons, Prince charming
The fire army discharges
I pay the lawyer, beat the charges
The energy is harnessed
Regardless
