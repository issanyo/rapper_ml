No one truly understands the way my mind works
Mental case inside it is nice to rhyme nice words
Observe the mind of a man
He's to execute the final plan
Of my life before my fucking mind bursts
Now I get why I can't put my head against the pillow
Less to write a little with her with the rhyme first
I see this blind birds with absolutely no direction
I try to teach 'em something standing at the intersection
Cuz If you don't choose your POV wisely
Your life can get corked upon like Paige Ivy
So don't grime me yet
Though I'm not infected
She might be so I'm going and protect it
I suspected that bitch from the start
Or is it just a draw that makes me sure she's a fucking tard
Paranoia secured it makes me fucking dark
I feel I have the right to blow her fucking brains apart
But I straight my stones
Seems every time I got to do this little dance
And the voice in my head keeps telling me "No"
But a building of a zoot, yeah it's killing up my soul
Ain't so serious but it's no joke
Don't get delirious so you might see your mind blow
See this fine flow?
It's what keeps me on the right side o' the line
The bright side o' the mind
So spin left to decide then you'll be losing that loss
With the sanity that you thought you had left in your mind
Fuck the let out
Pump your head full of rhymes
And see the birds splurt on the pavement behind you
The frequence lad, knows what the spray that will blind you
Fuck the repairs blud, see I was born fine tuned
So I write tunes
Like a beatbox
Set to pump you full of bars when the beat drops
I'm like disease what's to make you see next shit
Next time you try take me blud you'll respect it
Watch the red shit, explode
When my head split
Finally the mind of this man will be rested
