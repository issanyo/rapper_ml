[Intro: Roc Marciano]
Yeah, motherfuckers
Praise him
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Marc, niggas
Uh, yeah, uh, A-L-C
Yeah, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Posted up, gettin' my mack on, Jimmy Crack Corn
Sean packed the .38 long, John Gotti, Dapper Don font
My name was written in, it glisten in the dark
You got a Haagen Dazs heart, this is modern art
A start could run you a body part, Maseratis is parked
Five chains like Mardi Gras, spark
Beef never gets squashed, firearms pop
Why not shop? Rub fly vagina like Icy Hot
And hoard 90 in a Nike box
Arms in cardigans, parkas is like margarine
Revolvers is tucked in the Starter kit
I call it self-glorification
When the Porsche is escapin', euphoria's tasted
Words from my lips is permanent bliss
Superbness, you can't learn this with a internship
Experience, you nothin' to be taken serious
Display the .38 mysterious
The jewelry is luxurious, period
The position niggas is in, I pity it
About to take over this whole shit
Hoes ride dick like Pogo stick
Laughin' as I advertise fabulous rhymes
All that vernacular is fly
Caught your eye with just one try

[Interlude: Roc Marciano]
Marcberg
Phlaw!
Yeah, uh

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Wave the flag, surrender, your limbs is dismembered
Young tenders want to live with a emperor
Real nigga temple, swimmin' in placenta
Back sent you, for comin' out your face like a denture
I might be the best, Your wife by me'll be caressed
Your honey like bees in a nest
Get money right, scheme with a pen
The dream is bein' lived, believe me it is
Been to the mountain top, higher than highs
Falcon fly, that's around a thousand dollar fine
That kind of guy don't qualify to reside beside I
In the 745, I (Wooh!)
Bye-bye spy, nines light the sky like fireflies
The nigga that your child idolize
The title is mines, go find a cycle to ride
Before I put the knife inside your izod
Sucker! Nigga!

[Outro: Roc Marciano]
Yo, yo
Check this shit out, word up
This shit is effective, nigga, word up
Get results, nigga, immediately
