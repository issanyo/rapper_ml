[Intro]
He pretty much lays it out
He was a killer, he was a hired killer for Griselda
Uh, that eliminated people that were involved in the drug business
Yeah, yeah
Uh, agh
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Chorus]
We got the drop on you and you ain't even know (you ain't know, nigga)
Them shooters they follow you anywhere you go (they lurkin')
Them niggas in your bushes now, they give out wig shots (boom, boom)
They got the drop on you and you ain't even know (hahahahaha)
Yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (run down on 'em niggas)
Yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (hit all them niggas too, nigga)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (I don't give a fuck who outside, nigga)
Yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (brr)

[Verse 1]
Niggas thought the shit was sweet, I'ma make you fuck niggas know me
Talkin' like you a killer, well, motherfucker, come show me
I already sent the youngin through there bustin' his .40
Nigga shot up your whole block and he hit one of your homies
Nigga, we already know you pussy, you cover your Rollie
And you tuck in your chain
You's a fuck nigga, should've stayed in a fuck nigga lane
A lil' dread head nigga come in bustin' your brain
Lil' homie fuckin' insane, whoa
I got him and his homies in your bushes now
Sniffin' grams to stay up so he can put you down
Homemade ski mask on, pull it down
Silencer on, and neighbors couldn't hear a bullet sound

[Chorus]
We got the drop on you and you ain't even know (you ain't know, nigga)
Them shooters they follow you everywhere you go (they lurkin')
Them niggas in your bushes now, they give out wig shots (boom, boom)
They got the drop on you and you ain't even know (hahahahaha)
Yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (run down on 'em niggas)
Yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (hit all them niggas too, nigga)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (I don't give a fuck who outside, nigga)
Yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (brr)

[Verse 2]
Bitch, you was not official, so now we gotta get you
You better pray to God, he with you when that chopper hit you
That chopper pop and flip you
50 round clips in them sticks, boy, that's a lot of missiles
Yeah, that's a lot of missiles
Smokin' one with my young boy while I plot to get you
Tried to give him the .40, he said he wanna pop the stick too
Every night is gunfire, guns fire
Shootin' 'til my gun tire, momma was a jum buyer
Back in jail, out of jail, nigga, I got dumb priors
Drive-bys in that buick, low air in front tire
Hood I'm from made us killers, pussy nigga come try us
Now I know where you been hidin'
So, we gon' come find you, my nigga, ah

[Chorus]
We got the drop on you and you ain't even know (you ain't know, nigga)
Them shooters they follow you anywhere you go (they lurkin')
Them niggas in your bushes now, they give out wig shots (boom, boom)
They got the drop on you and you ain't even know (hahahahaha)
Yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (run down on 'em niggas)
Yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (hit all them niggas too, nigga)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (I don't give a fuck who outside, nigga)
Yeah, yeah, run down on 'em (brr)

[Outro]
Ha, yeah
Ayo, ayo, look at these niggas' face man
Ayo, these weird niggas, yo, they scared right now
You know what I mean? Shit is spooky, nigga
Uh, niggas know street shit when they see it
When they hear it, nigga
But don't get it twisted, nigga, think it's just rap, nigga
That's a fact, nigga, in real life, I'll knock you the fuck out, nigga
Hahaha, hat's my word, nigga, and you know my gun work, nigga
However you wanna do it, however you wanna play it, pussy
