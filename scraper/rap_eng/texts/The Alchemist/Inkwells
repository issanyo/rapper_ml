The machine reekin' fluid like they pissed in the pistons
Man there's bullshit everywhere the mission's to miss it
I put it past me, I'm whatever form they can cast me
I make it, when I make it, when I do, I make it nasty
Pass me, never that, I'm hoggin' up several lanes
Gravitized crazy you can feel the air pressure change
It's twenty-double-x guess the timing doesn't matter
Mindset is black and white does it rhyme and does it splatter
I'm chugging beers to get a buzz, no-one loves me
I'm the one you skip to catch the newest vid on Buzzfeed
Internet culture, get it drippin like it's diprevan
Rappers tryna flex come up short as your attention span
I'm twenty-six for like 20 more hours
The style dirty I need 20 more showers
The shit Ferarri, you like 20 horsepower
I broke the scouter, I got plenty more power
You city slickers gettin' bitter at the country boy
Face a cracker's barrel make you eat it like it's crunchy, boy
I gets reckless off the Henny and coke
I cut weed out my diet but got plenty of smoke with soot
Nice one, Ricegum, something corny though
Used to wake up with a blunt gettin' early morning throw
Now i wake up when the sun down, I'm a creature homie
Say you sellin' out the show, buddy i dont need bologna
Goons look like Frieza's cronies, Zarbon's, fargone
Stereo on Ice Cube, mob lynch, Marshawn
Lookin' like a martian, terrestrial extra
Your style don't drip  you got her wet as a desert
You little clowns simmer down get from round me hoe
You pimp a sound, get it down, then around we go
Shit's derivative as fuck, but shit, do it for the clout
Don't watch a gift horse while you screw it in the mouth
It's pathetic, ill school you on the craft and the ethics
The shit could print money got the passion to press it
I'm the past and the present, i am everything you wanna be
Got your hand out, lesson one, hoe: ain't nothin' free
I'm out here trappin like a bitch
And I ain't gonna stop till these rims 26
We make good music y'all ain't fuckin' with my clique
Life a bitch, throw a rack and make her strip
Never trust her, we the best out no discussion
I'm bustin', here's every fuck you that I can muster
