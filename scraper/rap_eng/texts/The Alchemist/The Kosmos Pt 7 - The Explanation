[Narrator]
On a trip to Moscow, in his apartment, in the capital...

[Interviewer]
How much of that experience do you recall, can you describe to me?

[Verse 1: eXquire]
Sweaty as fuck after my show, backstage, met three bitches
Video vixens, they ran up on me grabbin at my zipper
Asses out straight stuntin, thick like they only ate muffins
I smashed two and Dallas, grabbed the other one
Pillow talk cuddlin, underneath the sweaty comforter
One got her tongue in my ear the others massaging my nuts
When suddenly I hear this beeping noise coming from her bra
A walkie-talkie sound, she responds like, "We're ready boys"
The bed we're laying in starts to glow, I blink
We're teleported to a place where everything is awkward shaped
I mean the suns blue, the snows hot, the trees glow in the dark
A light stares right through you and hears your ultimate thoughts
It's weird I tried to stand and got woozy
Next thing I know this stripper broad is tied to me
Held captive by a race of strange beetle-like creatures
A gold one arose and said "Take him to the leader"
They marched us through the whole village like a prize catch
The natives snapped pictures and threw confetti at us
Soaked pinata, they dropped to our knees at the altar
Shadow a came up from the throne and walked forward
It was the beetle oracle her body sparkled
She carried a wooden totem that flickered like a light-strobe
Placed it round my neck, jammed her antennas in my head
And entered in my brain and planted thoughts where cells were dead and said:

[Beetle Oracle]
Remember that nigga from the hill
Up in Brownsville that you used to chill with
Fuck hoes and trade games with?

[eXquire]
Yeah my nigga dolt from the plazas
But fuck that nigga he's a traitor and a little bitch

[Beetle Oracle]
I didn't mean him, confused him with the snake-race
Out of Quadron 10, they want to use our land for digging
And they're gonna blow us up like nitro
We summoned you here so you could lead us in battle

[Outro]
I was taken, by my apartment, in Moscow, to this spaceship and we went to...
