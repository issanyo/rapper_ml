[Dialogue from Rocky IV]
“My husband and I thank you for coming to our training quarters today”

“What does all this do to enhance performance?”

“It makes a man a better man...
A great athlete a super athlete by harnessing all his strength…
We wish to educate your country”

“There have been rumors of blood doping and widespread distribution of anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union. Has Drago partaken in any such experiments?”

“No, no, Ivan is naturally trained”
