[Intro: Documentary & Curren$y]
The white girl is Donna, another prostitute
In five years she has had five pimps
She now operates without one
I'm makin' good around love affair, and I done
Employ 'em for love affair
That's what they love, like
Everybody wants love (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And a pimp isn't going to go like that
As soon as another younger, cuter girl comes along that can make more money
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, dada-da, dada-da, dada-da, dada, da)
I'm going after her
I can't stand
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, white and yellow Airmax as I step out my Lac
Plus I smell like a pack, little cologne mixed with that
My partners always strapped, I don't be on all that
They be wherever I'm at because they know how y'all act
I pulled up in a what's this, I came out in a what's that
A little switch up move and that's a stunt double pack
They talk but never attack, I walk with God I'm relaxed
I got a Rollie collection, you duckin' bill collectors
(Gone take you to that next level)
You niggas always stressin'
I'm in a suite in a Westin in a notebook sketchin'
New designs for the season, fashion week we gonna sneak 'em
Yeah

[Interlude: Curren$y]
Dada-da, dada-da, dada
Dada-da, dada-da, dada
Dada-da, dada-da, dada

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, yeah
Rockin' Virgil Airmax, Off-White cook crack
I got the razor blade and clippers you get your shit pushed back
I turned some shit into sugarcane a nigga couldn't look back
I can't evade these gangsta ways, I guess the hood did that
One pair of shoes now I got everything to lose
Virginia street blues
Your credit score fucked up in the set, ain't paid your street dues
Pussy ass nigga
Runnin' around with a motherfuckin' pack like you ain't
Like you did that shit before the Kane nigga, Kane train bitch
You niggas always stressin', I'm at a suite at the Westin
Fucked at the Waldorf Astoria with Alicia and Gloria
I promise every bitch I fucked in 2018 was a foreigner
Dead homies in my wall, I zip 'em up like the coroner
And you can passport stamp it, Usain or black Maybach it
But I still twist up in that Chevy or that Lac god damn it
And you can passport stamp it, Usain or black Maybach it
But I still twist up in that Chevy or that Lac god damn it
It's Gangsta Kane
