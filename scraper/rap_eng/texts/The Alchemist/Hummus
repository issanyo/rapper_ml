[Intro]

[Verse 1: Samiyam]
Uh, My Campaign's got me drinking champagne on an Airplane
Your plans change mine stayin' the same
Put the fan to the flame, throw a rack of lamb on the range
It was raised on open land not the cage
You grow funny over pocket change we're not the same
I throw money like the paper at the stock exchange
You got pasta for brains if I got to explain my greatness
Check my face it goes without even sayin'
Life is not a fair game, obstacles slain for profit and gain
I relaxed while the lobster felt pain
Luxury shirt, watch and a chain, I'm blowin' smoke out the window
While I change to the opposite lane I'm sayin

[Hook]
Accelerate, I made moves some will never make
Put the pedal down and never wait
Wait-Celebrate everyday but don't hesitate
Separate from Bullshit and get it straight

[Verse 2: The Alchemist]
Empty the cartridge out and pop another clip inside
Pull up to the party and park the whip inside
Do-rag capes double as a slip-n-slide
Studyin' tryin' to emulate the way the Tims is tied
So gracefully I cut the way the gems applied
Dive off the stage, landed on the crowd
Deliver my bars, aim for the stars and landed on a cloud
Eskimo jacket draggin' on the ground
Try to reach I cut off ya fingers for grabbin' on the crown
This the life we chose, can't switch or change up it
Take advantage of the label, rape the budget
Rock a hat made from an actual bucket
Soup kitchen, serving plate to the public
Burn the bottom of the biscuit every time I bake a muffin
Play the numbers composition smoother than David Ruffin
Pure Alchemy, the way the music is made of nothing
Gators are crushin', hands dirty from all the paper touchin'
Suede Tux, his hair and bold chains display the nuggets

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Samiyam]
Hold me dearly - in Tokyo they feel me
So I spoke clearly and asked for onigiri
Enough smoke to really blow through the ceiling like Tom & Jerry
Success takes time and it varies
(It isn't always that bad) There's two sides to every story
I take Bourbon straight or with lime and a cherry
Of my environment I'm wary, I smile but take to mind any sign that's apparent
Because the people by your side could be wearing
A sheep's clothing, but what's inside is a ferret
(Fucking Weasels) Rat, lemming, hyena or parrot
Inhale spliff, clear my mind, recline on the terrace
I felt inclined to inscribe and prepare this
So here it is - I'm tryin' to stack dough in myriads
Travel the globe, gain experience
Then scrawl my own name on the wall in a pyramid
The girl said I taste like a Spearmint
I picked up the ink to pen the thoughts that I see in grid

[Hook]
