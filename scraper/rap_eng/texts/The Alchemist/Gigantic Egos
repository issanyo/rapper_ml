[Napoleon Da Legend verse]
I feel rejuvenated soup and potatoes moving up the table fresh cream pies shooting up her naval
We Televised thru cable still liable to slay you
These lines fatal I can make a live wire stable
Survived the cradle turned into a live volcano crater
The games soft that’s what happens when u enables betas
I’m just a paper maker my music don’t label cater
Curse impersonators urban legend I’m a fable breaker
These women chase me like I play for the Lakers
Only on PlayStation, the first rapper on a paid vacation
Faithful to the game you hateful when u see us win
Like Kane and Abel, the expression on ya face betrays you
You outdated, I’m a cross between Styles P and Miles Davis
Went overseas without a touring agent
Like Dalhseim across the room slap you
When I die they’ll take my body make a tomb statue
Keep ya opinions for birds bitch who asks you
Get a new asshole already blew passed you
In a time capsule landed up at White Castle
Scholars studying my paragraphs like Matthew
You got gassed cause they throw a couple likes at chu?
That foul energy u give we throw it back at chu
Plus ya album was wack we want our money back
It’s over dummy we back

[Napoleon Da Legend Chorus]
We walking thru the gate like two titans
Sprinkle a little ignorance but not too righteous
2 dollars bills gets you two pizza slices
So pay attention I shoot a missile thru ya iris
[Rasheed Chappell Chorus]
We walking thru the gate like two titans
Sprinkle a little ignorance but not too righteous
2 dollars short will give your face 2 slices
So pay attention I bring the real to your iris

[Rasheed Chappell Verse]
A yo
I'm Black Gold
A ray of light in this black hole
And on the track
I lay my life like i'm RAMO
This world is ice cold
You niggas lack code
Back against the wall
I can do this with my eyes closed
Or a blindfold
I let the dice roll
And if the beat-nuts
More or Les I'm Psycho
It's money pussy & hydro
I stand alone I iso
There's not a nigga that I owe
To every nigga that I know
I'm like a raisin in the sun
Daddy was a solider
And he raised me like a gun
I'm fully loaded
With no safety and hair trigger
The 80's made me a crack baby
Don't fear niggas
When money talk
Don't hear niggas
I paint a picture so vivid
It's like you here with us
You hear the lord
Thru the aux chord
No collect it's direct
When the lord call
No corner pockets
On corner pockets we 8 ball
Don't take short
We take yours
Then take off
Then God bless
You listening to God's best
I was raised with the sinners
Around the Godless
But I'm a leave with the crown
Nigga regardless
Yes

[Napoleon Da Legend Chorus]
We walking thru the gate like two titans

[Rasheed Chappell Chorus]
We walking thru the gate like two titans
Sprinkle a little ignorance but not too righteous
2 dollars short will give your face 2 slices
So pay attention I bring the real to your iris
