"The last line of defense"

[Evidence]
Feel the pressure...
Yo you better plan ahead, gather your thoughts
I'm not gonna be the one wit no chair when the music stops
The Orange Agent, has just moved to your block
And gone headhunting, blame Herbie Hancock
Hard to get at, yo vocally serious
Never stress myself out, treat songs like interludes
Drum patterns are primative
Evidence, the derivitive
Of what the late '80s and early '90s had to give
Dilated Peoples, far from tentative
Caress this microphone, stay home and take your sedative
Yo I know our Platform is built on strong foundation
My Last Line of Defense, I keep a ace in the hole
On patrol, so balanced with no topic
The Weatherman lands at high noon, ready to drop shit
Could freestyle better or maybe rap faster
But soundclash wit us (Don't do that)
You flirt with disaster

(Back up in it)
The Sagittarius with flows in various
Types of pipes, and green to keep me hype
At thirty-thousand feet, yo my heart starts poundin
So I rarely fly, intentional grounding
Make my rounds to towns, kill em in order
I'm equipped to blow shows and turn kids out wit corners
(With ease) I flow slow like growth on palm trees
And set trends more than femmes could split ends
I'm makin power moves
In fact, as I speak now
Do my best to re-enforce the motto "Milk the cow"
Make that dough for too many's the main concern
I say make the right music, then your money's earned
Share the wealth with Babu and Iriscience
My death might be a tragedy, my life will be a triumph
Go focus on the star, the man who won the Heisman
Trophy would be broken, forget it, credit the linesman

"Evidence of the war"
"Don't ever lose sight of this fact"
The last line of defense
"When it comes to blood and rap, it's lyrical combat"
The last line of defense
"Evidence" "Don't ever lose sight of this fact"
The last line of defense
"When it comes to blood and rap, it's lyrical combat"
The last line of defense

Yo critique my mic techniques live, I carthage this
You didn't think I had what it takes in my esophagus?
A cat like you, yo your show sounds hot for real
Of course it does, standin still
Yo I dig your little pace, you're walkin forth at best
At that rate, on tour dates, I hope you never run outta breath
I'm Evidence, Mike Peretta, head commander
Both of my names like Gary Shandling's Larry Sanders
When I say now, this will take out in an instant
Wherever I go, my caravan goes/Gogh's like Vincent
But Ev at Princeton, they won't follow good
So I shock this microphone and split a tree trunk to hollow wood
The last line of defense, set your prescedence
Set your standard, make it known you own your throne
Yo, the last is when you hit em just enough to leave a gash
In time, the wound will heal, rest assure they'll make it known
Who threw the heat and felt the blast
Who gave the answers and what questions are asked
Are your favorite artists boring you? That shit don't make sense
Call Evidence The Last Line Of Defense
