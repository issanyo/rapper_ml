[Verse 1: Evidence]
I take chances, slow flow with no visa
I herd plants, don't grow for no people
I ran the animals over incidentally
Heavenly words, spit codes over chemistry
I'm alone in a world full of broken homes
Break beats and broken sound barrier cones
She just married the mob, then got buried alone
Body singing like canaries to the phantom of O...

[Verse 2: Alchemist]
I step into the dance with a spliff, a sensei
Get down with the sounds from the A.L.C
Big brolick, ropes, chains and Tashini suits
E.K.'s Gazelli frames, British knights and suits
Like the crest vest, and I'm a definition of deaf
Out of sight, dynamite, fake right and go left
Serving it raw: no stretch, go underwater: no breath
No mouthpiece, I speak for myself, no rep
Full publicity, my zero-to-sixty is risky
And the flow brings me more dough than creamy crispies
When it's fresh out the oven I'm dumbing, pealing hundreds
Off my knot, like peeling the skin off of an onion
So RAR-RAR like a dragon dungeon
Change your shitty drawers cause your pants got dumped in
Marijuana spliffs give me bursts of energy...

[Verse 3: Evidence]
Tone-deaf flows steal chicks, sweat the melody
My celery, green weed is the better clover
Even if I'm over the bridge, the bridge is never over
"Watch the rain" Mr. Weather told you
Get you leathers and your umbrellas whenever I'm never sober
Through a verse, it's hell on Earth and never colder
I got momentum from the propellers, salute me soldier
We stay relevant through new blood, a little older
A little wiser a little bolder (so?)
Unfold the red carpet cause I'm kicking this
Half the rappers platinum?! This shit's ridiculous
Excuse my French but I sat too many years on the bench
I'm not venting, spit each word meticulous
