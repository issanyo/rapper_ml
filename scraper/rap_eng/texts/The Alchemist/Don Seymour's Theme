[Verse 1: Midaz]
Pick your poison, a pen and paper are pointing at ya
You can bring your boys in and I'll implore 'em avoid the capture
Voice the rapture rapper create the crying that's after laughter
After dying at the hands and the feet of velociraptors
(Slacker) Open the book at the second chapter
Replace the first with the verse that I wrote with the tips of daggers
(Cracker) We can converse but the mix that matters
Between us is asinine, it's the fast design of a master crafter
Encode cryptures that can't be broken easy
It's part of the make up of Midaz so if you hope to be me
Negativo, never recorded on your TV's tivo
No homo, french kiss the beat and thought I'm speaking Creole

[Hook]
What I say is keying knives to keyholes
So we connect connects to intercept between the G code
Throw up your set again, I administer medicine
As a miniature sedatives take a minute to settle in

[Verse 2]
Repetitive peddling of your armories
Honestly probably the fucking reason faggots never win
Stop me if you've heard this one previous
There's no such thing as smart magic that be Genie Us
I usually plan my weekends to cleavage touch
Weekdays if I feel? Jack son genie bust
Clap son, feed him love, black sun, eclipse
You not growing up's why I'm ashamed of you, Cleveland's son
Jesus, he Damian, demon son
Flaming and I tel him go lick, Greenie son
Aiming at niggas sayings with cadence, kicked out of parties
Of niggas who's famous for not condoning their fakeness
Villainous calisthenics Alan the Chemist
Fitting lyrics Alan Wrench fitting right in the plan to fit in
(Get it?) Kicking these niggas off their pedestal
Making so when they say that they kick shit they peddle stool
Shit, I'm a killer without a life now
Smelly beer belly drinking Miller Lite for the lifestyle
More exciting than the writings of vikings
I'm your nightkin and with the Alchemist we back for license
