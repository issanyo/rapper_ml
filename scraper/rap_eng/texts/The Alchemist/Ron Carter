[Verse 1: Evidence]
I chuck a penny at a problem
I throw a rock at a glass house
A little famous when I mash out
A little crazy when they didn't pay me
A little hazy, the haze was 80s
City was wild and the world didn't matter cause the city was ours
Yep, yep the world is yours
The best view of the world's on tour
Less is more is bullshit
Invest in war with full clips
I'm like a pure Pit locked to the bone
Locked to these beats and bleeding locked to this poem
Beat knocks, still nobody is home
Birds flock like I got crumbs to throw 'em
3-D glasses, watching the throne
Maybe that or watching Moses Malone
Enjoy the high til the moment is gone
A moment later like the fire to the bong
I'm stepping out tonight and never coming home

[Verse 2: The Alchemist]
Stay brillo, skin thicker than an amarillo
My initials stitched on the pillow
Package vanilla, rap killer
Creep like a black widow
Show you how to make a stack triple
On the double, from out the duffle, let off a couple
Dynamite explodes and I emerge from out the rubble
Stampede, get caught in the shuffle
Soft like you never felt trouble
I'm holding weight like a belt buckle
Demolition, dig dirt with the shovel
While I'm putting work in the oven
Like paddycake, feed him to the lions, Gladiate
Heart speed's at a dramatic rate
My words are cocaine strictly
Roll up a crisp hundred dollar bill and sniff me
I'm Gretzky, hands shaking when I hold the pen like epilepsy
Get away with criminal activity
Scotty free, til they arrest me
Push the limit when they press me
Respect, say my name correctly when you address me
Take a seat, you don't impress me

[Both]
I'm thinking like...power hook
Humungous

Hey Alchemisto, you think you're slick
You put drugs in my pistol when I went sick
But if I happen to die because of your drug
I'm putting in your puno, a .38 slug
Me and him, your uncle and your homie's friend
Rollin' down the street on rims
Don't separate weed from stems
Ron Carter is in the place
Ron Carter, he's on the base
Ron Carter
