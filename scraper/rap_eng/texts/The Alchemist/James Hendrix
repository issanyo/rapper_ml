[Intro]
"What if uh, C-A-T really spelled 'dog'?"
"Uhh.. that's heavy!"

[Hook: Evidence]
Uh, I'm commission-driven, so pay up
I ain't fuckin up these Dunks or these lay-ups
..And if you see me wearin make-up
The same day you saw Jimi Hendrix wake up
So those that give a fuck, I apologize
Know my heart is here, never compromised
Those in attendance, I wanna thank ya
And wish this night all night, throw in the anchor

("AS WE PROCEED..." <- Puff Daddy)

[Verse One: The Alchemist]
...No introduction
Metal tips through hard hats, I'm into construction
Tip the bucket, rhythm rugged, I'm into corrupt shit
Big budget stay dipped like a Chicken McNugget
(F'real) Excellence is what you should expect
Runnin without a breath (what) I'm comin out of left (yeah)
Uncut like dope without a step
No +Brother+ without the +Step+, no show without the bread
My words surf crowds, go over your head
Took a rhythm, push 'em over the ledge
I'm criminal, my feet wet (uh), I'm drippin with technique sweat
(+Sweatin my Technique+) No more than a minute to make the beat stretch
Pardon the way that I speak French, gunnin from out a deep trench
(AH!) Write my name on a street bench in cursive
Permanent ink my verses, beatdown person
Finish I'll bring down curtains
Navigatin my Surburban Expedition, Excursion
No lithograph, I'm the original version
Money duffle bag'll fit a person, punch the clock put the work in
Earth spin on my finger like Julius Erving

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Evidence]
I shine (I shine) I glow, motherfucker
Never doubt one second of Evidence
State-wide, world-wide, consecutive elegance
No weak shit since the first song on Weatherman
It's called "I Know" (I know!), total control, pressure made
Bling diamonds in the rough, mix created from coal (whoa)
My rhyme is a sign and letters are tolls
No pen, dip my hand in the ink and let it go
(+Letyourselfgo+) Touch a lot of reefer
No I don't spit no bullshit raps on wax, I touch a lot of people
I touch a lot of needles, no I don't leak dope in my veins
I got the psyche of created evil
Believe you me, cousin is pain
Got a brother name karma, father insane (HA~!)
Related to sin and sin's met Cain
Raising cats and dogs when Allah says rain
("AS WE PROCEED..." <- Puff Daddy)
No game, it's Mos Def +Mathematics+
Life is tragic, addin it up is more dramatic
Except StepBrothers back at it
For the very first time, center stage it's automatic

[Hook]

"AS WE PROCEED..."

"In Olde England, they had hang roofs on their houses and the cats and dogs once leaped on the roof
When it rained, the roofs got slippery and the cats and dogs would slide off of the roofs
Therefore, it was raining cats and dogs"
