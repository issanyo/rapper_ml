In the early day, a DJ used to play a record, like, from start to finish
Like, you know, which I felt that kind of boring to look at or even to listen to
So what I would do is pick the most climactic part or the strongest part
The funkiest part of the records and just continuously repeat that part over and over again
Repeat that part over and over again (Repeat 6X)

(“Can you dig it?”)
