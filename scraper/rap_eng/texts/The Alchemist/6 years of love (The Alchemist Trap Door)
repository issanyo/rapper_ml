(Hook)
I will always love you
Tell me will you ever love me
2 love birds sitting on a tree
Tell me if we can be the power couple of the world
I missed it when you were my girl x2

(Verse: 1)
Whoâ€™s the sad kid
Always did what dad did
Cheating on his women
He was never winning
Searching for beginnings
Notice it was done for
They calling my lover a dumb whore
I don't like it i always try to fight it
Copped my life off of craigslist
All my life I've been waiting
They placed me on the listing
Drugs thrown i'm resisting
Put me in a choke hold
I loved her ever since i was like 12 years old
It doesn't fit
Man i'm singing as i sit
Words that Chris can spit
Isn't legitimate
Our love does it exist
I still love you but you don't care
I like seeing you in your underwear
Look i know you care
You like it when i stare
Playing with your hair
Tell me is it fair
You left me for a faggot
And when you break up you don't give me the extra chance that you always talking about
Babe please let me hold your hand
I know you miss me too

(Hook)
I will always love you
Tell me will you ever love me
2 love birds sitting on a tree
Tell me if we can be the power couple of the world
I missed it when you were my girl x2
