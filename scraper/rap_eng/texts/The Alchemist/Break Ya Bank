[Intro]
Got my warmup in.. The money, fuck what you say life is all about the money
All about the money, UH
Dolla dolla bills life is all about the money
Fuck what you say life is all about the money
I'm a good guy but I'll kill you for the money
Living for the money

[Verse 1]
Kiss me I’m Irish, damn right I got luck
My crew could rob you then still prove it’s not us
Man when this shit drop, I might get shot up
This is me knowingly blowing my spot up
I'm cold as ice, damn right I’m that cool
Those hungry nights made me hunt like a cat do
I was a good guy, now I’m the bad dude
I don’t want to rob you but will if I have to
If my stash is low, then heres what it comes to
You got some money then my boys'll come through
I don't say no names, I don’t say I love you
I look like that nice boy but think like a thug do
And you trynna save me’s like a dude trynna wife a thottie
My innocence was murdered you won't ever find the body
Yeah I’m broke boy you better stop reminding bobby
I'ma shoot up Bilderberg and loot the Illuminati
A young crazy muhfucka I'ma ride or die
Swear that I was this close to holding up my nine to five
The music biz taking money like the government
And plus bussing tables ain't cutting it, So im about to

[Hook]
Break ya bank
Money be on my mind
A muthafucka mobbing out
Sounding like, I be robbing dough, I be, I be robbing dough, I'ma (X2)
I be robbing dough, I be, I be robbing dough (X4)

[Verse 2]
Woah, this kid is out of control
Must be the drugs, the yayo got me out of it bro
I'm fucking buzzed! Another bag is 'bout to be rolled
Ay Fuck the fuzz, I'm married to the game it can't get annulled
Ay what you know about my life hoe? I never sleep at night hoe
You might be tough, but you don't want to feel this knife poke
Fuck conspiracies, this is real life hoe
But if I need a sacrifice then I'ma end your life slow
Cause I don't think you understand the pain I feel
You haters make me want to go and grab the stainless steal
Get my cheese up, trying to attain a deal
It turn these rappers fake, HeebzStreet remaining real
Bobby so gone, like Monica Brown
Living like Aleister Crowley, don't see me in Hollister now
Fuck boy I grew up, into a screw up
Still one day this rapping gon' pay, but for now i'm 'bout to

[Hook]
