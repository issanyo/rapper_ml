Hook X 2:
It's like one girl broke your heart and now you hate women
So now you playin' games with 'em and you stay pimpin'
Wait 'till they find out you hate bitches, play bitches..
These the bitches that's mad we even say "bitches"

(Verse 1)
I ain't saying I rape bitches, but I've raped bitches
Nah, I'm just playin' bitches, just wanted to say "bitches"
Bitches, so inconsiderate and play victims
Picking up a handicap bitch'; I keep the Range risen

Repeat our age difference, now keep the same distance
I stay chasin deranged women, with that hate in 'em
Same difference, ex bitches was way different..
She was dark, remind you of her, so now it's race driven

Dont chase women, I'm painstriken; I stay drinking
She say she keeping you close, but she stay distant..
Back I stay thinking, slang I stay spittin'
From a faint distance, no expression like my face missing

Da Vincy/Einstein; brains of the century..
Another reason I'd pay to have her erased from my memory
Forget the damn past, a la "Men In Black" flash
Cut that ass off; the one you can never have back (Get it?)
