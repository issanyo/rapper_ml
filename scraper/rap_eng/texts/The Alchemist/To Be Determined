[Evidence Talking]
Where I’m from they say the sun shine all the time
I keep seeing rain… yeah

[Evidence: Verse 1]
Uh, squeezing blood from a rock
Making something out nothing, that’s something I got
That’s one thing I had, while the others didn’t get it
They was chasin the world I brought it right to my block
Brought it back to the (uff?)
Stay reppin my coast… poof, I was blowin the spot
Without knowin or not, not knowing a thing
Trying to prove to most, made it open my lane
I found my slot, they went right, E-V went left
So Common, one day it’ll all make sense
Soundbombin’; no way we’ll all make ends
Survival of the fit, a few win, but most quit
Or fend for themselves so here’s to good health
Here’s to drama, two up and one of ‘em fell
"Hear, hear", to that, this is for my LA Cats
And Dogs who never left to the world, “We Back” *C’mon

Hook Aloe Black
Sometimes I ask myself, “Why would I need anyone else?”
To Be Determined
To make it through this life… when everything’s a brand new (vibe?)
I had struggles in every single muscle, always on the hustle and I know… and I know I can’t make it, on my own

[Elzhi: Verse 2]

Had visions of being caked up
On the island while the weather’s freezing
Whether he's in the French Caribbean
Swimming with amphibians
Or in Hawaii blowing Maui Wowie, life is good
I dodge bullet grazes
Slash the nights that coulda ended my existence
For instance, through the persistence, the distance
We formed a number of statistics
Once a lot smaller looking up to Shot-callers, not ballers
We never grew up just got taller
Trying to find freedom in a trap
Hungry for success they eat up
There’s food for thought I feed ‘em in a w“Rap”
I’m taking trips to France
Make it rain where the strippers dance, dance
Sip in hand, grippin my money clips in hands
It was hell, I thought I saw demons hiding in lost souls
Straight out the evil books inside of my far scrolls
They say you should toss goals, throw away your dreams
That nothing go the way it seems, It’s done or
You feelin unsure, but that’s what this one’s for

Chorus: [Once]

[Aloe Blacc: Verse 3]
Push as hard as you want, against the wall bro
Push the wall, knew they be looking for you like Waldo
Times was harder than before, when it was fun and games
When we was just spittin rhymes trying to get a bigger name
Now car notes involved and bills require grindin’
Who’d ever thought that Aloe Blacc get back to rhymin’
Street philosophers could theorize, “it’s all timin’”
Economist would say, “It’s kinda rough to find a diamond”
And all the simple lining in the clouds couldn’t change
The simple fact that it pours when it rains
All more of the same
And my score in the game, let it reflect
That I earn every little bit of respect I get

[Aloe Blacc Singing]
Oh, it’s time, get up off the wall cross that line
My momma told me that every flower needs rain shower
Like it need sunshine
I know I can make it, you know you can make it, We can make it
If you get on yo Grind…
