[Verse 1]
Word to Will, buried in his Fila suit and heavy chain
I wanna be iced-up, nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everythang
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose drawers
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under my bed, mask and a flashlight
Livin' my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mommy told me from weed I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack-on?
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Boppin' to the Supremes, smokin' joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want

[Hook 1]
{Repeated in the background: "I did it my way"}
From crumbs and roaches and rats
Converted in from hustlin' to raps
From break dancin', back spins on the cardboard
To bullet-proof Bentley's, gats in the car door
Never gave a fuck what nobody said
They hoped that I failed and wished I was dead
If I fuck up, it falls on me
I lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat

[Verse 2]
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Jacuzzi's, Gucci soap, throwin' cash in the air
Though I still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get what I got
They think it's a lot; in the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, comin' if you ruthless or not
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder 'til I seen my man get popped
No blood soakin', layin' there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was lookin' right through me, yo, starin' beyond
I wonder what he saw: the limos, movies and tours?
Did he die in vain or represent for the cause?
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game; y'all can't relate, fuck y'all (Ill Will)

[Hook 2]
{Repeated in the background: "I did it my way"}
Converted in from hustlin' to raps
I call it how I see it, niggas
If you don’t like it – so be it, niggas
I make my own rules, I do my own plans
Gangstas do what they want, suckas do what they can't
Takin' sacrifices, kid
You only gettin' one life to live

[Verse 3]
Hoes in my focus slow me
Roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies
Scoldin' my foes who phony
From blocks where coke could feed you
And cops is over-evil
They know some people
Who tell on felons who sold some diesel
Heroin and blow, it ruins minds
Knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big-time
In just two years, their crew disappear
Snitches and bitches smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminisce and remember
Sittin' on wood benches gave me splinters
Just a baby nigga thankful
When them killas came through, guns out, movin'
I thank the ones who said
"Shorty, go home!", we about to be shootin'

[Hook 1]
{Repeated in the background: "I did it my way"}
