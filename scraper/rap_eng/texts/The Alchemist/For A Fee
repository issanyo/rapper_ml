[Intro]
It’s the Yellow-Face
Oh and this is produced by the (Alchemist)
SAS ALC business

[Hook]
(What do we get for ten dollars?)
A little weed, little speed
From me for a fee
You can have (anything you want.)

[Verse 1]
Here we go again friends, it’s the Yellow Face
In and out of town with a case of the Shake and Bake
Hey young world, it’s been awhile
I know I left the streets to the fruitcakes and fragile
Little grown-ass kid makes a mad child, who don’t want to grow up
Gangster gone wild
Hollywood, Hollowing niggas get punkin’ ass, they get nervous
When they see scenes of blue and red
Instead of server shooting [?] serve, words tear
Through the soul subconscious, quite clear
So I smoke on that fine, toke, eyes tear
Long Ranger holding that [?], my dear

[Hook]
(What do we get for ten dollars?)
A little weed, little speed
From me for a fee
You can have (anything you want.)

[Verse 2]
Bloody valentine [?] and lines
Rocky mountain horror picture show probably at nine
Niggas fighting in the lobby over seconds a shine
A disgrace to their mothers design
I guess their fathers neglect is the reason for your lack of respect, and I bet
You said things you won’t live to regret
All that frontin’ at the function for nothin’
You could have had
(Anything you want.)
Early morning coffee for all us
Now you eating lunch through a straw for like four months
Line ‘em up
Ducks fall down like dominos
Fighting on stage but don’t stop the show
‘Cause they want to know

[Hook]
(What do we get for ten dollars?)
A little weed, little speed
From me for a fee
You can have (anything you want.)
