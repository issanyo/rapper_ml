[Verse 1: AG Da Coroner]
Balboa fighting in the last round, tap glove
Sudden death, over time shit, no coming back cuz
Sniffing on the powdered dust, eyes wide, make sure
Your shoes tied, we're running from the reaper in a homicide
Street's Disciple, legendary Nas shit
Chopper down, move quick hop out the cockpit
Snakes on the plane, hold guns, they on some cop shit
Too late to make friends, son is obnoxious
Respect taken if niggas don't wanna give it
I close my ears to stories if you ain't live it
Half these niggas in the game cast reflections
Of Pinocchio, halfway thugs 'til we address 'em though
The weak shall perish when walking amongst the realness
I wrote this straight from the heart, so you should feel this
Lie detectors on Maury couldn't reveal this

[Verse 2]
Who's the father? Many of us busted off
Hot dogs in her face, she wiped the mustard off
LES for a leather, the shit was butter soft
Dome in the stadium, quit because she love to boss
I'm an outdoor speech giver, the podium killer
Nobody realer but God and that's my nigga
I walk with angels and toast with demons
Two sides to the Gemini mind for different reasons
I was born in the middle when nature was switching seasons
Bang, zoom to the moon, you chilling with Jackie Gleeson
