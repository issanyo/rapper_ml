Niggas hating, say i won’t make it but they must jest
Cuz i could take the girl away saying hey mama like Donda West
Honestly can’t find a test
Lost bounds with me they in debt
Now niggas tryna flip the switch on me like quavo with baguettes
You’ll end up with defects
Don’t make shit to complex
Don’t keep coming with the twitter fingers we all know it’s a flex
With the flows I’ve been possessed
Since my father was under arrest
When we start shooting cats like vets
You’ll see two definitions of texts (tecs)
No Cap your shawty throw it back
Call her Mitchell and Ness
Wouldn’t be me you got that youngboy
Leaving hickey’s on her neck
And who’s the best
If not me i don’t wanna here nobody
Like Marlie Matlin
I’m where the truth lies
And this my party
I used to know this bad Latina
She was acting kinda naughty
Now she fw the mar-icons
La despedida shawty
5’9 145 little scrawny
But notorious for spitting
Shit
Like big in a skinny body
Used to having lines go over heads
I drop atomics
So Keep it honest and stay With them nursery rhymes like Johnny Johnny
I’m finally not staying silent
I’m sorry for promoting violence
But my biggest primacy
Is to take niggas profits
Like Charles Ponzi
Im Clarence carter I’m out her touching deep souls
Bars hold weight so i feel, I got Pusha t flow
What would meek do? Running into me
With the same hunger he knew
Straight like that, and I just finished bumping DC2
Got some burn on you niggas
I’m finna come out with it like me too
Guaranteed to replace whatever artist you retreat to
Don’t try to test me if you ain’t been though what I been through
From the gutter couldn’t wear that backpack unless it’s see through
My flow caught the holy ghosts
They would think i was born in Israel
Made different You wish (Jewish) you knew the flavor that he brew
Ask any of my old hoes it’s
I don’t give a fuck with he do
But everytime i come around
It’s I’m so happy to see you
And y’all really need to stop talking to me about these what’s his names
No that’s not a bar i really can’t remember what’s his name
That’s that Steve Harvey shit
But his shawty gave me polished brain
Must stash her away don’t want family fued with ya future bae
Don’t fuck with these niggas
In it for bread not the love of the game
Don’t check for you soon as you hit the air you force the fame
No direct deposit just want strictly cash I’m Tyra banks
Can’t wait in line no more
My auto motive is to move up a rank
Oh you crip now, thats really an oxymoron
Last year you was a schoolboy why setback, what type of shit you boys on ?
But i know real niggas stay in the field they deployed on
And when the city direct you know what type of timing my bulls on
Huh
I just got in the game Already feel like the realist author
Point to god to get me away from
You cons i’m tryna be Kemba Walker
Unbothered like a conceited bitch
And we offing problems
Soon as I link with my clique we lurking we ig stalkers
Cuz i don’t know who to trust anymore
They all be posing
Don’t seem like anybody loyal
Just ask DeMar Derozan
But make sure you coming with that heat
You think i didn’t just alleviate the score
Or I’m shooting while you Rushing (Russian) this shit is like GTA IV
