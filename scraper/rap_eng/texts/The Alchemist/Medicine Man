[Verse 1]
I don't write rhymes I write prescriptions
For your addiction
Audio fixation my flowtation is like morphine
Through the bloodstream
Generic rap just not potent like P
Jeez its not music this medicine and
I'm not a rapper I'm a medicine man
More like a gifted holistic mystic
But try to kick my habit and get dope sick
Cause I'm embedded in your bones
You in denial if you don't jones for more P
Yeah shortly he'll be coming back I know
He'll be havin' them cold sweats
With the runny nose and the bubble guts
I give you couple puffs of this fire right here
You'll never get enough
In 66 it was all about smat
76 marijuana was the trend
86 was crack, 96 and 2000 right now is that medicine man

[Verse 2]
Put me in your sound device and turn me up loud
When your adrenaline rush your feeling me now
I may cause rowdiness but not drowsiness
Keep out the reach of children
I'm a bad influence
I make them bastards grow up faster
And start askin' questions that you can't answer and
I make grown women feel young
Make your pops wanna hang out wit us and hit the club
Take you on a natural high you never come down
Distinctive it doesn't have a taste or smell
Something like the air we breathe
You can't see it but its there
You die without it you need it
When you under the influence of me
Careful cause you might just crash g's
Total your V still pull my CD out the changer
You fucked the range up
But you still need that medicine man

[Verse 3]
You a addict for me
But pretend like you not
See I don't fuck up lungs and leave track marks
Niggas be closet fiends and down-low fanatics
Embarrassed to admit that they got a P habit
Cause they women get curious
They wanna know what that hobby like
Baby believe the hype
Its the upper most echelon
My baby this is what it feels like to climax
That other shit stepped on
And this is what you been missing after all of these year
Now you can tell the difference
Get spoiled after fuckin' with me
Cause now the only thing you want is top quality
I'm discernibly dope its murder she wrote
The first try
I got you stuck off the realness the illness
That sick'em all rap
More sicker than smack
More powerful than anything
Its that medicine man
