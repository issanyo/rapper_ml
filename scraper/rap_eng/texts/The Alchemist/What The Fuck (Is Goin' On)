[Verse One: Black Attack]
See I appear courtesy of all raw niggas
Them off the wall spit at y'all cornball niggas
Go at 'em
Black Attack shit flip joints that had 'em
Chicks going crazy hoping Sean stab 'em
It's all a pattern
It's going down the same way
Construct the hot shit and bone the baddest bitch the same day
Beside that though I flow all over tracks with butter
Gut it out with the illiotic rhyme like no other
Because ah, the way I do my shit I eats hefty
And I run with bigger niggas, make your clique wish they left me
Protected by
The uncivilized
Smack the shit out you erratic dicks, spit in your chick eyes
I got my shit down the professional
Repping those
Stepping through though
Trying to be the one y'all checking though
So my live niggas get doe and y'all bitch niggas silent
While I roast these wack cats, A&B commits the violence

[Hook]{x2}
Yo what the fuck is going on in here?
I don't know but it's real though
You fuck around? Caps peel slow
Wilding
Nobody's smiling
Rough enough to bring Brooknam to Roosevelt Island

[Verse Two: Problemz]
Ayo I'm uncontrollable
Unstoppable like B.L.A. said
Got rap fiends pawning they ice, certified bass heads
Alias Kevin Killings
Murdering tracks, Problemz and Black Attack hand/verbal attack
Remember P?
I'm that nigga that put the facts on wax
Me and Black go way back like suede fronts and 8 Tracks
Similar to ADATS
Digitally mastering voltage
Extremely ferocious
Beware, shit is explosive

[Black Attack]
Y'all didn't know that they could hold us till we rip shit down
Then they flipped out, love the way we script shit now
I lay the law down, it's real now
I'm indefinitely skilled out
Don't give a fuck how they feel now
So when they ask if I'm raw I spit
And I let 'em know it's serious
With this I get ridiculously sick, that's it
Leave them cheesy niggas split
My arsenal filled with thunderous raps lighting up your whole shit

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Problemz]
There are seven magnificent wonders of the Earth
Fuck becoming the eighth
I should've been first the way I disperse the verse
Problemz
Definition: extreme difficulty
Seriously delirious like Ed Murph' and Nick Nolte
Rock around the clock 48 Hours
Shitting on niggas giving they bitches golden showers
Sour hearted house retarded niggas like asylum
Pull strings like violins
Resort to violence
If necessary contact my secretary
I tell the bitch to pencil you in and let the games begin
You ain't never in your life heard a nigga with such poise
Internationally ranked supreme like I said in Kill The Noize
Where your boys?
(Bring them small soldiers)
Supposed to be backing you
Tell my niggas to applaud and watch the Linx start clapping you
Black Attack and Problemz
Buckwilding
Rough enough to bring Brooklyn to Roosevelt Island

[Hook]
