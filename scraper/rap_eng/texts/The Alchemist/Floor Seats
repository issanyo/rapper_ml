[Verse 1: Mach-Hommy]
Ay yo
Straight lace up at the jilt in the snatch bar
1998 Labour Day, shopping centre in Pathmark
Okay I guess the feeling is back cuh
I threw it all away Bob Dylan
Hoodaville is a trap blood
Niggas been calling me slime since '99
Fuck a vine
This loopy killer thought you was in line
I make a movie, spend a fortune on the side
Jus' ask my cousin Bookie how I run up on your car, lick off a shot
This for my niggas with no bond
That wanna see a nigga like me pull up for the feelin' real [?]
I aim to please
The Balmain jeans was bleached
The teeth was gold
The shoes was chic
The fuck you mean?
The rebel with the fashion on Z
Zig zag zig
Forever with the magnum on me
(Yup)

[Bridge]
Yo, my shit is like-
My shit is like magic marker to a crayon
Like, you know nam'sayin'? When I-
You know what I mean?
When I put my-
You know nam sayin'?
And then I, turn that shit
You nah'mean?
Into that and then, come back
(You know, I got NOW!)

[Verse 2: Mach-Hommy]
Take a negative and a positive charge to start a whip
Port-au-Prince, swing the 'chetes at y'all and carve a niche
Water whip
Get the fetti with bars
You brought with it
Duck, I'm on shit
(Brrp)
You on the list
Plucked the story thus far
Jus' fucked a nigga shorty in a Audi
With the .40 tucked bruhh
We left the boarded up spot
Nigga you can have the bando the block
Distorted buckshot
Who rock the St√ºssy Air Max?
She let me pop the pussy my boy
She 'bout to do the fam next (you already know)
We got to do the annex
Ain't no highfalutin', we the jewelers with the Rugers
Spandex
Antex, you get stretched like leggings
The Smith & Wesson like Tetris
Speed up the block for speaking reckless
Heat up the chops and fricassee the rare fish
Breakfast
(Yeah)
