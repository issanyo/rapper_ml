[Chorus 1: Royce da 5'9]
I swear I swear
To give em every line like I'm runnin out of time
When I'm out of time I say I came, I saw, I conquered
I'm a monster, boy look at here
I see something nobody has seen, nobody has seen...
So I guess it's on me
I swear I swear

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9]
'77's the year I literally crabbed up in here
To raise hell til God giveth me heaven
It appear I suffer no fear
His presence is real in wisdom
Programed to murder and seize and kill the system
To build if tow down been build
Was told to let you know how it would feel
The signs say slow down, we yield
Roll down the blinds say
Writings on the wall like Beyonce
But if it's in your blood, you ain't beefin', you the entr√©e
So I say lay down, since I trade it, 10 pounds around me
Honestly, I done seen raped off themes
Bodies scraped off the concrete, face off hits
Separate, we rockin and rollin with dead weapons
If you ain't smelled that machine gun
Fuck from dumpin Ledd Zeppelins
Dead testament's dead with some weird
Cholesterol bagged up in the care of someone
Viet western

[Chorus 2: Swish]
I swear I swear
To give em every line like I'm runnin out of time
When I'm out of time I say I came, I saw, I conquered
I'm a monster, boy look at here
I see something nobody has seen, nobody has seen...
So I guess it's on me
I swear I swear
I swear man

[Verse 2: Swish]
Ayo listen
Ayo in'82 I was born to a lotto head
So I spit to do numbers, so I can get this lotto bread
Best news I ever got came the day that Lighty died
So I write know that my only enemy if life is time
In time they say the struggle is respected
And another man's pain can put it all into perspective
Overcame a lot and pop told me to buckle up
Every odd I had to fuckin nuckle up, so I know what is what
Yea so I beat the beat til we in mourning
And pray the word flood the block like Isaac in New Orleans
Young John fly the death, kamikaze shit
And I swear to blow it down, Hiroshima, Nagasaki shit

[Chorus 3: Bishop Lamont]
I swear I swear
To give em every line like I'm runnin out of time
When I'm out of time I say I came, I saw, I conquered
I'm a monster, boy look at here
I see something nobody has seen, nobody has seen...
So I guess it's on me
I swear I swear

[Verse 3: Bishop Lamont]
The 1978 was my release date
Executive produced by Richard and the Raymond
With no containment site, they spit the baby's brain
What's the blueprint for brilliance? The zillions
Partially insane, a little black boy
Kinda strange, a little awkward
Born on Halloween so he was meant to be a monster
More life anals while welding the gauntlets
Sick 6, I've had a 6th sense by Aby Joe Osmond
Grew up seeing deaths so murking you is no problem
Been to hell and back, I spawn that before I fall in
I keep the heat but heat to burn, we walk in crematorium
I'm old school, got tools like builders emporium
Don't make me show your real picture, Dorian Gray
Your whole style is baloney, sodium nitrate
Seeing 2 bars, I'm hard as crow bars, you suckin dicks
You can't go hard with candy bars, you fags is on twix
