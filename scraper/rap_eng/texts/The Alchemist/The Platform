"You've done nothing" 2x
(Uh-huh, yeah, the Platform sound)

"Dilated" "Mind created minds"

(We takin this worldwide) "Every word is heat"

"Dilated expand" "That Platform sound"

[Iriscience]
Aiyyo The Platform, watch the stormtroopers swarm
The Death Star's more than the devilish dawn
It's where Evil and The Force manifest their form
It's no good without bad and no night without morn
It's relativity, balance, stability
It's creativity, talents, ability
Rakka shift the modes of the wizard and the warrior
Hip hop-up and move to strike like a lawyer
Quick to be like "Fuck a rapper after what I'm after"
Friendly how you front, but behind me talkin backwards
Basically I'm down to build but stay ready for battle
Plus most of you goyim oh, I mean cattle
The catalyst, never rock the mic in vain
Energy ain't created or destroyed, it's changed
The Dilated Peoples hit you wit the Big Bang
And theories that the Red Shift couldn't explain
Platform

"You wanna front what" "You've done nothing"

[Hook] 2x
Aiyyo The Platform, takes respect to perfect the artform
At times a battleground where rappers get their hearts torn
"You wanna front war" "You've done nothing"

[Evidence]
Cuz when I step off, then step back on
Son you'll never catch me preach-ing what I'm not practic-ing
Word War II, Platform the illest flows
I know my hunger's real, I still get nauseous at shows
My motto, I didn't write but this I quote:
"It ain't where you put your words, it's where you don't"
End quote, and wit this in mind
Yo I bring flows more rare than black quarterbacks
I never got sacked, or pushed ten yards back
We could go rhyme for rhyme, line for line or track for track
And after that, the crowd'll react
To the future we are the magnetic attract
Two-thousand twenty, confusin no doubt
I catch the story of your life on VH1 Where Are They Now?
And as for mine, I'll be sixty in my prime
Still science and theories, and droppin rhymes on time
Platform

"You wanna front what"

Chorus 2x

[Iriscience]
Aiyyo I seen apathy, met love and know hate
I'm heavy on the mic, can you handle the weight?
Either you learn to adapt or you're sealin your fate
Only brave when you get more dusted than home plate
Rockin D&D wit the Alchemist and Babs
And after the lab, we send Ev to catch the cab
Platform troop, make moves and stay true
Rock Steady-Zulu creates a devastate crew

[Evidence]
Yo I Platform my strategy, mix words wit alchemy
Evidence, I won't get caught shot on the balcony
Between you and I, I'll tell you, here's the diff
Gun to your head, your dead, pointblank, I shapeshift
That's right, study Chemistry like Al
Life, use your potential or Steve Howe
I'm about to call it quits, like too much weight'll break your rack mount
The man'll make you move yo, so make your move a backout

"You wanna front what"

Chorus 2x

"Every word is lethal" "Dilated expand"
"That Platform sound" "You've done nothing"
"That Platform sound"
