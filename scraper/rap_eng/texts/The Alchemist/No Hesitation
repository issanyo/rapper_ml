[Verse 1: G.Reed]
Outta reach, I'm Cheech & Chong out the bong
Wesley Snipes out the pipe, watch my Blade get swung
Been slim since '91; don't test my skill to kill
Still
Some mother fuckers wanna ice skate upHill
In the middle of the summer months
I believe in karma but I don't believe in alotta rappers coming up, what!
I got the answers to whatever problems coming bruh
Dispose the body then play a game of "Whodunit" whaaat!
I don't be knowing where they flowin'
I got more important business like getting my ass tourin'
Cause my peoples looking at me like, "Get the Show on the road" and
I don't ever speak on issues so I feel like I'm implodin'
Look!
My life a comic-book
I'm Spawn, you a pawn, hook a bomb in the kitchen, mother-fucker let Muhammed cook!

Drogas!

[Verse 2]
Fuck water whippin', this is wire hanger rap
Never say my name in vein, I'm heroin on the track
Pure, incorruptable; Only do it if I want to
You could never beat me, could kill me and I'll still haunt you
I'm Silent Bob, the director and the star
You on Fremont and still can't direct me to some bars
I'm fresh up out the jar, Massachusetts from the start
But better recognize my county is still Clark
I've been creating art, been my motive from the start
I'm an Uptown knight, you an Uptown narc
Any Uptown night, know I prolly just sparked
And I'll prolly roll another 'fore I leave where I'm parked
Mind all heart, my heart all flame
Treat rappers like the Mayans and my niggas all from Spain
My weed not Malaysian but I vanish with the plane
I'm bout to mark my territory on a higher plane

And The Hills said Nothin' Was The Same

[Verse 3]
Pissin' on the whole fuckin' industry
And anyone who ever lied, don't care if you was kin to me
Bitch, if I shit in your mouth, you gotta love it
That's the only way what I'm eatin' is goin' in your stomach
Smoke a stockin' watchin' yours plummet
Politickin' with the GAWD$ meetin' from the summit
Niggas know I'm sick, I don't spit I vomit
Throw a comet, fuck a wish, that's a promise
The rap games now, touch that's your hand
If you don't see me coming you should prolly blame your mans
He a Stan
My number 1 fan
A fiend for them grams
You jelly cause I'm making the jam
Catch a snippet, crack your face in
Spit from Mason
Jars over heat with a little bit of space In-
Between the flame, wave that to your face, Don't
Ask when you feel it, it's No Hesitation
