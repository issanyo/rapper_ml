[Roc Marciano]

Eloquently, it's said in the Bentley
It's pimpery, butter leather Pelles is princely (uhh)
That's how we make a better entry
Elegantly, squeeze Berettas out of 750s
Dress spiffy, finesse the MAC-11 out the Dickie
Let off a dozen rounds into your Crown Vicky
Play the bunker, double-barrell - Brian Pumper
Plunder, bitches asses get plumper
Ferrari bumpers for lead dumpers, bread's buttered
Celebs is gutted, baguettes is lemon-colored
1100 to the stomach, get jet luggage
While them niggas legs rubbing like errand runners
Killer instincts, minks is full-length
That's what we be doing with ink
Rolies is pink, rosary minks is over kings, five fly over your meat
Hold heat, flow to the beat, appropriately
O.G., vocally I'm a key
O.D., showing the fee, who knew what I would grow to be
The only G to leave 3 in your shoulder-piece

[Verse 2: Oh No]
Oh No the bad athlete, running with cleats (uhh)
Stomp on your back so you can feel the defeat
My fam stash heat like Mozambique
Watch your fleet drop like they got hot feet
Peep: y'all made weak, sick frames, room please
We true varsity, mix Kane with Kool G
But I'm cool, see - Bankheaded like Cool C
A cool kid, old-schooler with Kool D
Because I'm over y'all
At the same time, I'm over y'all, at the same time, I'm over y'all
Cause I'm higher than most of y'all
Most of the time, I'm focused y'all
A fucking rotisserie, roasting y'all
Act off, only when the camera's on
See the lights flashing, dancing, hammers drawn
That ignorant rap, get blitzed and slam your song
Cause I ain't got time for y'all glitz and glamour, dog (uhh)

[Verse 3: The Alchemist]
(Uhh) A hundred K stack up
Way beyond the limit of sanity, jacket straight rap
Peel a tape back, rewind a wheel and play back
I ventilate on a rhythm, breathe on a drum, beat on a bum
Cookie crumbler without leaving a crumb
I'm spotless (hmmm), movement Swiss like the hand on my wrist
Money stretch like the neck on a ostrich
Open the dungeon, check on a hostage
Sit in the cockpit
Press button bombs and drop shit [Yeah, that's what I say]
I'm a chemical terror
Toxic spill, meltdown incredible era
The crown-wearer, screw-face 'em down starers (Fuck you lookin at?!)
Eat a weight shake and take down mirrors
Take down broads, break down walls
Fuck a barricade - Boss hound, dog, I lay down laws
Shake aerosol can and spray down walls
Push the pen with a vengeance
With every sentence going overboard
Overlord, I piss on peasants
Sour cloud got a lemon scent
More than a pretty penny spent (That's right)
Hell-bent, but heaven sent
