[Mayhem Lauren]
[Intro]
Do a spin move, nigga, I been smooth
Straight up, uh
It’s all Queens everything
Shoutout to all my West Coast niggas, though
Yo…

[Verse]
Still crazy fly rap with a lazy eye
Couple chains on, nigga, that’s me, uh
God bless me, shit, don’t stress me
Gortex hugging my chest, I look sexy
Switch lanes, picture new frames, the coupe swangs
The crew bangs, I’m rockin’ new fangs, y’all niggas too strange
We not the same, nigga, matter of fact, we very different
Take the bread out of the safe, don’t be resistant
Uh, I’ll knock the head off the headliner
Then get the opening act poked for a stack
It’s doper than rap
I do this for my niggas selling dope in the back
You might see me on Livonia with Adonia
Looking well rested like I hopped out of a coma
He’s Corona, shit, he’s Jamaica
Rings on my hand like I’m a muthafuckin’ Laker
