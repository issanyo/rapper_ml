[Skit]
George Papadopoulos
Knock it and pop a nigga papa-less
Papa shit, chocolate doctor that dotted the document
Listen to my father, bitch, P!

[Intro]
Yo, mic check, peck, peck on Bernadette neck
Big breasts, I'm erect, let's have some sex, yes
Uh... titties feel the best now
I can.. yo, yo yo hold on
Yo, what the fuck man?
Fuck is you talkin' 'bout man?
Spit that monkey shit, nigga
We gorillas, nigga
Ape don't kill ape
Yo spit that real shit, nigga

[Verse 1]
Yo... P!; I Chewbacca'd your chicken
Chin checkin' your chest
Get chopped champ, got stamped by the Boot from the Camp
I'm provin' I can, I'm provin' you fake
Like you movin' them grams of Peruvian flakes
I am truly an ape, caesar the leader
Put two in ya face (BONG PONG), bleed where I leave ya
Do deeds of a demon, you do deeds of a diva
Sarafina, Abner Louima, Bieber's a cleaner
Believe what I feed ya, I feed the believers
Knowledge Wisdom Understanding, sativa's a creepa
College, prison, gun in hand put ya seed in a sleeper
Got a vision summer Jam with my speech in the speakers

[Bridge]
I'm not Martin Luther (Luther)
I'm flop corner loser
On the block poppin' Rugers (BONG BONG PONG)
I'm not Martin Luther
I'm flop corner loser
On the block sparkin' Buddha, P!

[Verse 2]
You wanna see me get rude? P! BCC
Most definite effortless when spittin' these degrees
Ruckus rule shit, get down when the tool click
Tool spit back, impact is like a mule kick
P nice and funky fire
I will fuck you up, He Cipher Monkey Cipher
Medicated, dedicated bastard
Level-elevated attain the Educated Rapper
Clowns be seated
Bow down to the world renown, Brownsville Jesus
Damage a dude
Sleep ya brother's keeper, peep the Family Feud
Listen Pa, I am not in the mood
Watch you step, get 'em Bob shot him right in the shoes
The rhyme is incredible, king, I do floss
The mind is a terrible thing to Lou Rawls
