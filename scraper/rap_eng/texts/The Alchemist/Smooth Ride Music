[Intro: Movie Clip]
Now I see it clearly
My whole life has pointed in one direction
I see that now
There never has been any choice for me
*Applause*

[Verse 1: Havoc]
Where the fuck i'm heading, where the fuck i'm going
Can't pull the wool nigga, I be knowing
Lo and behold, i'm in overload
Niggas talking like they like me but the undertone
Vibrate like the bass in this beat
I make shit, you bite and crack teeth
I stayed on one of the illest and some agree
Do a nigga dirty what I don't want done to me
Me versus y'all though that's something to Barlow
Won't make me any kind of money call me shallow
Keep my guards up, burners in the cargo
Easy math but i'm a motherfucking problemo
Whoever didn't get the memo, jot it down
I'm about to lock this bitch down
I just do what I'm doing cause I like to do it
That smooth ride music in this

[Hook: Scratches]
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
On the boulevard

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Yeah niggas ain't even doing the math
They feeling it three and pass, they greedy and never last
On speedy recover fast, come back like I never left
But you was never here, erase you like catch a sketch
You clowns sick, got to vaccinate
Better yet just evacuate
Shorty just don't give head, she decapitate
Left a nigga bugging, told me that she had rounds to make
Go bitch, go, nigga gotta focus now
Ain't getting any younger, gotta let the money pile
Whole life was like a trial, they threw the book at me early
Guess they figured I wasn't worthy
Long shot made me [?] fake friends yeah serve me
I don't get a lot of love but I don't let it detour me
I just do what I'm doing, do it cause I love to do it
That smooth ride music yeah

[Hook: Scratches]
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
On the boulevard

[Verse 3: Havoc]
I was born into this life, I didn't have a choice
So I grab the microphone, gave this little nigga a voice
He started talking to the world, the world spoke back
Then he started getting hate from them brokeback
Mountain motherfuckers, i'm a child of the gutter
Hot piece of butter, we just looking for the supper
I want it now, i'm impatient
I'm hungry now, fuck the waiting
They say Satan a lier, I made it through all the fire
My name posted on flyers, i'm hot, wanna get higher
Then I already is, that other other bracket
O.D. 'til I get it, motherfucker straight jacket
Coming at me sideways, it'll be a foul fucking call
Like Seattle in the end, when they threw the fucking ball
I just do what i'm doing, do it cause I love to do it
That smooth ride music yeah

[Hook: Scratches]
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
On the boulevard
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
Cruise, cruise, cruise, cruise, cruising
Down the street
