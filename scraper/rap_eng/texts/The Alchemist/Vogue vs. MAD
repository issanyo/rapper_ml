[Verse 1: Big Sus Boi (Shampoo Papi)]
Sus Boyz get it off & poppin'
A little fire for your Christmas stocking
I don't know if I'm Nash or Stockton
Pizza boy. either Shaq or Rodman
I know I'm so precocious, my pen game so ferocious
Game changed, something like the solstice
Take this potion and overdose it
Mind blown like the movie Scanners
Mobile like I'm Alabama
Jew fro in a bandana
Got jewels, no Santana
Got checks on my checklist, check out my necklace
Check out my Netflix, I watch the best shit
I am a vestige, I am a vessel
I'm a messiah, shout out to Jessel
Mustard & pretzels, pretzels & mustard
Dick pics & downloads, shout out to Custard

[Verse 2: Sus Boy 3000 (pizza boy.)]
I’m certain, one day, my kidneys will make hard stones
I’ve been starting every morning with a Marge groan
When it comes to rap beef, I’m Jean Bon
I feel something like Reiko on Kahn’s throne: A joke; supposedly meaningless
But I could be more if explored
My retort to whether rap is art is “Doesn’t that seem harsh when Seth MacFarlane can make a million off of farts?”
To be clearer, that’s my n-word, no diss
