Verse 1 (T.I.)
Below da Mason-Dixon Line, hey, im da best u gon find...
Bottom line, i ain't humble, cuz nigga its bout time...
Rather grind on da corner, hollin, i got dimes
Rather then know that I'm da best in dis shit and not shine
Give a fuck bout a clique if its not mine
Got rhymes, im da sign of da time, I'm not lieing
Nigga plannin on robbin me blind, start tryin
Got sumtin to but a end to 380's and Glock nines
Shit u gotta shoot from ur shoulders, won't fit in holsters
Bid on ur life and force a forclosure..
I can rebuild S.W.A.T.'s all da yay dat i got..
I'm da king it dont matta if i say it or not
It dont matter if da old niggas dont wanna say dat I'm hot..
It dont matter whether my first single was playin or not
Nigga i stay right here, never go gold, shoot nine videos, and drop records every year..
All da fake niggas, feel real niggas'll break..
Young, skinny, wit plenty whores, puttin niggas to play..
Hey talk behind my back, u have me in ur face , wit da PSC in ur safe, while u pee in ur cage!
