[Verse]
Trying to return back to the cloud which I have fell from
It's rowdy down here among the company and bedlam
Seldom have I ever thought if I could modify my motives
It could float me in these waters then I'd end up being welcomed
Hell could be this very moment that you're living in now
Given the constant changes based on under payment and local
No "know how"
A question of self-worth arises when seeing others walking past me underneath the same sky
Time brought with it a sentence that sadly I can't carry
For it's certainties concern me with aging with grace badly
Forgiving mistakes takes a lot of will and compassion
Though no matter what you choose the effects are long lasting
In between minor and drastic is the result of the action that was taken when asked
Now you end up dragged by gripping this kind of attachment
Conscious restructured via rehabilitation which included different trials that required me to wait
You see my patience is a virtue. I'm rectitude sound and when without it, it is clear I'm like chameleons with changes
You can take a different view on things depending where you stationed
When we're high up, we perceive the world through higher elevation
Which can cloud the judgement based off of the status we've obtained and when we're low, we tend to look at everything with pain
Oh how I wish that I was gifted with a bouquet of flowers that I could put into a vase so I could stare at it for hours to admire the assortment of the florets in my vision
It has floored me with it's coordinated colors and position as in the arrangement was a lovely ensemble
It was floret stained glass which made me feel calm
However when flowers die the beauty goes to the beyond
I've seen the rain fall one time too many
Instead of basking in the warmth of the sun, the sky wet me
I was let down gently when trying to catch a ray
Instead of soaking up the sun, I was drenched in disarray
It was zealousy compelling me to finish what I've started
Who will back us for our art before they call us the departed?
We can dream but not give off scents of innocence lost, but it's cool because I'm old and I find rhyming is cathartic

[hook]
In the summer, fall, winter, spring
Change comes with the seasons when the seasons start to change
Days are passing me by
Leaves are falling from trees as I am one of them moving so swiftly in the breeze

[spoken word]
Now stopping to pick violets
Now singing a happy tune
At last....heart broken
