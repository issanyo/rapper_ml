"What's his name?"
"I know I've seen that face somewhere before."
"Who is this person?"
"Notoriously known, one might say."
"What's his name?"
"What's the meaning of this?"
"I suggest everyone keep quiet."
"Everyone except this person."
"Let's get on with this."

[Verse One]
Yo
I'm about to catch wreck
Sentimental ass, pussy ass nigga, you ain't a threat
I see through your hard facade, it's a gay silhouette
Oooh, you wanna kill moi?
God bless
I'ma put you to the test
Step off I suggest
It's like pissin' in the wind nigga, you're gonna get weeeet
I'm a felon
Ask Ellen ya damn degenerate/Degeneres
Pay rent on my premises, I'm your whole hood's nemesis
Plus I leave gun fights with no blemishes
Turn your fruit loops from quick kicks to the poop shoot
Trainin' new recruits, takin'...I don't know who, who's loot
We gang bang, slang, blow out brains
Spit a shot, pistol whippin' ya knot and your ears rang
I'm swingin' on niggas like damn orangutans
I do my thing servin' cane in the rain
Hard Rock Cafe
Open nights to day
You gotta pay to play
Cause I ain't givin' no crills away
I was made, born and raised in the U.S.A
Home of the slaves and The Braves and yeah, yeah, the A.K.'s
You was high and fly once now crash and burn mayday

[Hook] [x2]
I am my worst enemy
My mind, got ten personalities
Inside my head tryin' to break free
With nine doin' wrong and one godly

[Verse Two]
Kid, I'm a street sensei
Chop off feet like Kunta Kinte
Fuck what men say
The game is elementary
I kill with elegancy
Too put it eloquently
I'm your majesty and you are simply a casualty
That I'm forced to deal with savagely
With my bare hands
I'm givin' niggas ghetto brain scans
Lump your head up, like the damn Elephant Man
Throwin' monkey wrenches inside your programs
Swell you up like clams
Hittin'
Pedestrians is the way I get my Benjamans
Cause we ain't sentiment
This is a 100%, pure adrenaline
Leave my victims tremblin'
Traumatized like they've never been
Twitchin' and shakin'
Never come outside again
And all your hoods resources and all your hoods men
Couldn't put that nigga back together again

[Hook] [x2]
I am my worst enemy
My mind, got ten personalities
Inside my head tryin' to break free
With nine doin' wrong and one godly

[Verse Three]
"Motherfucker what?!"
These are fightin' words punk
This town ain't big enough for the both of us
You either have mad guts or you're stupid as fuck
Or your crew is Reebokin' you and got you Pumped
But if you ask me personally, you slip too much
See, we can see you, but you can't see us
To stay up I sniff a bump then hit the blunt once
Gettin' fucked up, layin' low, watchin' you from the cut
With a sick bunch of raw meat eaters that taste blood
And we're all scavengers, ? savages
Top Gun like Maverick on a quest for that lavishness

[Hook] [x2]
I am my worst enemy
My mind, got ten personalities
Inside my head tryin' to break free
With nine doin' wrong and one godly
