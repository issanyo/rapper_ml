[Spoken]
Since you became alive again so to speak
Like Christ arose from the dead
Now set your sights on the rich treasures and joy of heaven
Where he sits beside God in the place of honor and power
Where he sits beside God (beside God)
God is my joy in times of trouble
He is my home and heâ€™s the same Jesus

[Chorus:]
He is my everything [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Time after time
I so often forget that God has never, never failed me yet
When the weight of the world (weight of the worlds)
Falls on my shoulders
He props me up and makes me stronger

[Chorus]

[Spoken]
I come in the name of Jesus by the power of all this here
Whose name you coming in?
(Cheers and applause)
By whose power?
