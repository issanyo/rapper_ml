Verse 1 (Justice McFly)

Pocket full of grams the same color of canned milk
Angle on life sway the same way the can tilt
Can't judge a lane by the man's built
Everything trash, it's downhill on a landfill

Still remember how the first 100 grand felt
8 ball, snooker, on a 100 grand felt
AGL the team, never took a handout
If its worth doing you should do it by your damn self

No floaties, swimming by my damn self
Fleeing the paparazo coppers got them cams out
Posin' in promotional pictures to get my brand out
Bout to get stripped of my medals, I've been a bad Phelps

Movin' weight like a sumo with a handheld
Pushin' at the Juno's in a Judogi and blackbelt
Fiends with the yak mouth, assed out
Sittin in the trap house, you can either breathe or you can tap out

Verse 2 (Loe Pesci)

On this final lap, I'mma give you five cousin
Race for these brown broads; Hindi 500
Drugs fucked you up, you slang in your home
Feelin' sly, but you watch your whole family get stoned

People hanging off you like a cancer thats grown
Even bad bitches brain infected, bad to the bone
Spread to your nerves, now you don't answer your phone

And you just lamp at your home, like the lamp at your home

Mountains of white like in Aspen, buggin'
Christ to the passion, lights for the action
Can't change for nothing, radio hate that too
You need some Arab loot to get your playback, cute

Don't play me or play myself and I dont play that fool
Look crazy on the mike like a face tattoo
And a big rest in peace to the homies we lost
You say i been off the walls, I do a throwie for Dock

Four letter fill-in, kill all the pain
Like more penecilline plus the raw you been sniffin'
Of course I was driven, for the Porches and Lincolns
These cards you were dealt, its better odds if you dealin'

Hook X4
These cards you were dealt, its better odds if you dealin'

Verse 3 (Osa)

Everybody frosty, must be the northern air
So cold out here my Polo bear's a Polar Bear
When the winter snaps, bubble goose triple fat
Something this dope usually vacuum sealed and triple bagged

You on your couch poppin' Seroquel out the blister pack
I'm pullin up parking parallel where your sister at
Hit her once, I don't hit her back
Get rid of that, lose my digits if I ain't claiming you on my income tax

Dog I'm dying to get back to the bunker, back to my brothers
Farm head, maxilight ultras
Emerge from the smoke in a fitted
Burberry coat, blap blap Murder she wrote and you finished

We the best out since Les Stroud, what the stress bout?
AGL conference up at Pesh house
Thrats show up in some Iced out bear grills
I told him last night teeth iced out bear grills

That's some wild shit, Kodiak fur
Switch blade shorties; Cognac and purp
And you can hold that homie, go and roll that with your girl
Dog you don't owe me shit and I don't go back on my word

Hook X 4
These cards you were dealt, its better odds if you dealin'
