[Verse 1]
When I was younger
I thought my life would be easy
Always had my parents to guide me
From the cold world they could not make me see
I had no worries
Anything I wanted was there for me
My friends wishing they could be like me
With the diamond rings and the baby Gucci

[Chorus 1]
I'm thinking of the good old days
When all of my life was fun and games
And all i had to do was think of me
No stress, no responsebilities
I won't cry any longer
All of my pain made me stronger
I'll do the best to maintain
That happiness that i remember

[Chorus 2]
Why d'you leave me, tell me why you left me
Innocence as a child so easy
Why d'you leave, tell me why you left me
Daddy why d'you leave me? Mommy why d'you leave me?
Why d'you leave me, tell me why you left me
Innocence as a child so easy
Why d'you leave, tell me why you left me
Daddy why d'you leave me? Mommy why d'you leave me?

[Verse 2]
Life as a teenager
Started moving oh, so rapidly
Took my mom and my pops away from me
God was rolling, and I could not see why
They had to leave me
Who would have thought that this could be
My life was turning unbeliveably
This could not be happening to me

[Chorus 1]
I'm thinking of the good old days
When all of my life was fun and games
And all i had to do was think of me
No stress, no responsebilities
I won't cry any longer
All of my pain made me stronger
I'll do the best to maintain
That happiness that i remember

[Verse 3]
Now I'm a young lady
And didn't want nobody to think for me
Went against my family
And was a baby having my own baby
How real is that, can ya feel me?
Didn't need no help from nobody
Not even no help from yo daddy
I, myself, and my own Lady

[Chorus 2]
Why d'you leave me, tell me why you left me
Innocence as a child so easy
Why d'you leave, tell me why you left me
Daddy, mommy
Why d'you leave me, tell me why you left me
Innocence as a child so easy
Why d'you leave, tell me why you left me
Daddy why d'you leave me? Mommy why d'you leave me?

[Bridge]
I know ways, they can't remain
No matter how fucking hard it may be
I'm gonna walk with my head up to the sky
This life is like an alternate eye
