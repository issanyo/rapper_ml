[Verse 1: Boldy James]
We on that Kool Moe Dee, Wild Wild West
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest
Got on my earrings doing my utep two-step
With the trey pound and my double-breasted
Trying to take over towns in that bubble Lex
That Escalade just another big drug investment
Running through the beer quicker than that one nigga
On the Monopoly board, I got tunnel vision
All I see is cash so if the money missing
I'm on your ass quick fast in a hurry nigga
Trey city, M-1 stay murder ment
Time for the percolator dirty glove circuit breaker
Power up when I run it through the outlet
She sock it to me then I plug into the power strip
Extension cord working and if it short circuit
It's cause I'm working on this joint with the Alchemist
