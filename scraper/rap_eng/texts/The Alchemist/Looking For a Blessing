What is it that God’s called you to do?
What is it that you have burning on the inside of you that you wanna do for God?
I’ll let you know tonight, you can do it
Everybody say “I can do it” (“I can do it”)
But you know, it’s not because we’re Baptist or we’re Pentecostal or we’re Church of God in Christ
Or we’re Lutheran or we’re Catholic that we get it done
But it’s because we’re in Him—I said it’s because we’re in Him we get the job done

You know, I don’t know about you but…

Could you play the other side of that tape—that, um, Biggie Smalls tape? Turn it up!

God’s a friend that we can’t see
So put your hope in Jesus
Keep looking for a blessing when Jesus comes
So… (Repeated)

If you don’t mind, God don’t mind slaying your weak ass at the end of time

Keep looking for a blessing for all problems—looking for a blessing
Keep looking for a blessing

Where was I?

So… (Repeated)

Don’t fear your God, really don’t run—fear Him when you die!

So… (Repeated 2X)

Keep looking for a blessing
Keep looking for a blessing for all your problems—looking for a blessing
Keep looking for a blessing for all your problems

So… (Repeated)

And you need not be looking for another motherfucker
If the first sacrifice of God wasn’t enough...
Maybe you would prefer to pay God with your funky ass blood
