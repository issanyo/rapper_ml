One writer says that when you go somewhere with Jesus
You must always be prepared for a storm

Some people don't understand that sometimes the storm gets inside the church

Jesus never promised that the ride in the church would be smooth
He never promised there would be no storm
He simply said "I'll be with you"

Praise the Lord
