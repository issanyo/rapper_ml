[Tristate]
Soundclasher, broadcaster
Grandmaster masher, rap rapture
Capture patterns with such stature
Staggering style addict they can't stomach the status
Off kilter, sketch colorful graphics
Habit, straight radical, Hannibal's mathematical
Sun Tzu, the literature's literally that tactical
Son you, fatherless child, out of the vile
Hands down, dance over the drums, James Brown
General Gemstar, Custard blade
Cut you for the roughage
You can't ketchup, you all mustard
With no originality, cats is pitifully wack
With little league raps over t-ball tracks
Listen, simple and plain, y'all outta pocket like loose change
All we saying is pick up your game
It's gold chain, slang bang

[Killer Ben]
Splashin' and thrashin', niggas rappin', ask me what happened
I've been cuttin' niggas down for log cabins
The dog yap, the guns clap quicker than a bark or a bite
But you niggas is undecided like hermaphrodites
S'posed to be blastin' your pistols not flashin' right
Well your lyrics ain't killin' nobody so pass the mic
If you ain't killed nothin', you gon' let it live, sensitive
Frontin' but soft as a baby with a bib with a titty suckin'
Me I be titty fuckin', them chickenheads be cluckin'
Lookin' for chicken feed, picture me trickin' somethin'
I got a trick for her, can she figure it out
Wanna see a magic stick disappear, open ya mouth
Brown bag baptize lyrics in brown water
Suffer close quarter post traumatic head shot disorder
Kangol, spit fire, my rhymes syllable slaughter
Beretta leave holes in you grips the size of quarters

[Evidence]
Me and Waka Flocka was coolin' at the Palladium
Jumped out the helicopter into another stadium
With drugs that can't flush and guns that can't jam
A rush association with the Tuscany blend
It's a custom, deem people, evil believe no, hear no, see heaven
Below the needle lethal, five members of the Beatles equal
December I was live till November with the Mayan prequel
The most tatted passport in history, another category class A victory
Millie pulled a pistol in the winter, the list of Schindler
Where the sinners and killers, dealers and villains living under ceilings and pillars
Stealers of millions, still a fuckin' winner with no feelings
I'm ever catching, Dynasty Du without the lesson
Pyramid money is professsion

[Planet Asia]
Nefertiti hanging like an anchor
I'm like a banker, Haitian gold motivation
Working Turkish, circulate paper
Fuck around, go ahead, be the quickest way to meet Mother Nature
My every statement is disrespectful and blatant
Sophistication is calculated for greatness
But hold the math, total mass, wax like phonograph
Tracks, soul controller rap, snap like photograph
Raps is lethal, this dosage of dope packaged for people
Backseat you with the Eagle, evil
It's a stick up order of seafood
So be cool or get beat on
I'm the original so take that bullshit back to Pelan
You little fragile ass peons, freeze up like freon
Liquid source, my niggas is on we flip shit different
Spiral event, another shipment, charge me with the violent intent
Try to say the God fell off, whatever, ya mama nigga
I'm hot like the lama in your bomber with drama
Osama, Obama, Hussein Saddam, bomb palmer
Don Karma, crack rock pecan, body armor don
Polly on the song long with no training
Straight up, I leave that shit bodied then I'm gone nigga
