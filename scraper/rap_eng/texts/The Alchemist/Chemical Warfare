[Intro: Eminem]
You are now listening to the sounds of Shady
And Alchemist, Alchemist, Alchemist

[Verse: Eminem]
Got an axe in the duffel bag, couple of fags
Stuffed in the backseat, muzzled and gagged
Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians, a couple Hustler mags
Now grab the Pez dispenser, fill it up to the max
With muscle relaxers, the governor of Alaska
She lusts when I ask her to shove my Polaski sausage up in her ass, huh
While we hover over Nebraska shootin' at the fuckin' buffalo pasture
In the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster
She's screamin' "Grab my titties, Shady suck on those bastards"
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after
I'm a gigalo, bitch I look like the juggalo rapper?
Every day man I just seem to get a little bit doper
Shit, back down, man I'd rather lick on a scrotum
And eat the fuckin' Octomom's pussy lips with some okra
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg scissor with Oprah
While Rosie pussy-farts and takes a piss on the sofa
Get a boner and play dick swords with the Jonas
Brothers, your motherfuckin' mother's aroma's
Like no other, I keep thinkin' of her smothered in somas

[Hook: Eminem]
It's chemical warfare, drop bombs like Saddam
I'm bringing the drama, like Barack Obama
Playing rock em' sock em' robots with the Octomama
I'm vato loco, homie I'll cock those llamas
For chemical warfare

(Did I just talk about the octomom twice in the same rap? Fucking whack)
