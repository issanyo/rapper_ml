Ok
Let me start this race
The way it aught to be started
Come on lets pause the play
I had go behind them bars it was a short delay
But now I'm back and niggas like that boy jabbar is a great
Niggas ask me my top 5 and its hard to say
I guess a lot of rappers gone be in that caution tape
I'm really tryna be a boss like Ross and Jay
Before I see my momma hair go from dark to grey
A lot of my lil cousins really got tossed for ye
But one day ima take that barbed wire off the gate
My dog zay bought a k
Niggas caught him down bad he really had to crawl away
I don't know how he here today
But we knew where niggas worked at
That's the same spot that we lurked at
The same spot we almost went bizzurk at

That's too much for me to speak on
Like these lil niggas and they weak songs sounding like ringtones
Reach wrong boy we tote something in each arm
That'll make sure all these pussy niggas sleep strong
The same shit happened to my nigga beezy
And letting that shit go wasn't easy
Believe me
No I ain't broke
But I can't afford a murder charge
That's what got my daddy and my grandpa in them burglar bars

I'm tryna get rich I'm hurting dog
I'm searching dog
This rap shit is all I got that's why I'm working dog
Shit I remember thinking yeah I got talent
But when the rent is due that shit ain't gone pay the balance
The salary and celery is all I'm ever after
Cuz my family will never be happily ever after
We all got similar traits
It ain't shit you could say
Spit in your face bitch give me my space
Shit I might kill a career
I might use it as bait
Yeah I got hella ammo it just ain't up for display
I ain't no banging nigga ion rep no colors
Just a soldier rag toting on the mag for my brothers
Turn them cartier stunner shades
To some shutter shades and duck off in a cutaway till its another day
Man...
