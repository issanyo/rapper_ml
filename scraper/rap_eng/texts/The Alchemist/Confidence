Yeah it's like this
E.V. the MC on the M.I.C

"It's like that ya'll" x8

[Evidence]
Get set cadets, all bets are placed on the ace
I go to space without my weed lace
Check my face, my eyes they like staring at you
I know you hard, you frozen like a statue
I check the mic, for quite the right reason
That kid's a made up concept like the 4 seasons
On the calendar, peace to my islanders around the city
This track's like the Seven theme music
Which ain't pretty but enticing, I'm top notch like Bison
"Respect or get done" like Mike Spinx and Tyson
The movie, cause yo I peep flicks and store the memo
Like I can sing a whole song, please listen to my demo
Cause the pro's work are taken, to expectancy
The best in me is not got, the motivation is elation
Call me Ev, six and standing
But when my high comes down I be Michael Landon

[Hook]
Evidence, to release my pain
Put the needle to the record, not the needle to the vain
Simple and plain, I aim with both hands and confidence
I aim with two hands in confidence

Evidence, to release the pain
Put the needle to the record, not the needle to the vain
Simple and plain, I aim with both hands and confidence
I aim with two hands...

[2nd verse]
I turn tents to fortresses, and waste baskets to an oasis
And spray paint like walking on bugs you can't erase this
It's etched in, watch you step in
Ev the lethal weapon, drop the vibe is Aristyle
All I leave left is land mass, and lava rock literally
Intact when it's done, I rise the temperature considerably
Exist within my mind so my thoughts are my own
My hurricane, my sandstorm, my blizzard, my cyclone
I like my mic toned, and headphones surround sound
I hit from diverse angles write my name in italics
A boldprint, I sketch the blueprint that manifested
For Dilated Peoples, I got stocks invested

[Hook]
Evidence, to release the pain
Put the needle to the record, not the needle to the vain
Simple and plain, I aim with both hands and confidence
I aim with two hands I'm Evidence

Confidence, to release the pain
Put the needle to the record, not the needle to the vain
Simple and plain, I aim with both hands and confidence

[3rd verse]
The episode's get swung, I cough up lung phlegm in word form
I got backs and tracks point like thorns
The torn opposition gets flushed down the storm drain
Till it evaporates and saturates the wind chill
Fact to hack, Evidence will tap your internet
I go long, complete thought, you never get to intercept
The mastermind, plus exceling with the marker
When darker bring Havoc like Prodigy's partner

Evidence...
