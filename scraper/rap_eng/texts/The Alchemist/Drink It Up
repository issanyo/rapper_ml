Verse One: (Roc Marciano)

Patek Phillipe rocker
Punch beef in the meat locker
Treat plots like copper
My eyes cut D proper
G-shocks for the teeny boppers
Squeeze Glocks at your V-collar
The "5" driver
The lines like peach cobbler
I sip the Martini with the olive
Trollops all be brolic
The face of the Presidential: Black Onyx
Back is the iconic
Fat wallet
Fuck hoes, that playing exotic
Buss' Chrome that spray up the cottage
Body rotted
Products rise like hydraulics
You probably washed like Palmolive
I palm Llamas
Hold bank with the robbers
You thrown in the tank with Piranhas. (Nigga!)
I'm built like an Adonis, (Tilt!)
I can feel it in the air like Phil Collins
