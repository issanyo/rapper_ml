[Verse 1: Cho$en]
I'm more like an artifact you're artificial, I'm like a bristle on a swivel a chisel as I pencil in a stencil
But see I never feel you, I never pictured in my mental
Cause when I pictured pixels all I seen was the potential
In this, world of believers where the soul is in the speakers
Where goals higher than dreamers off the laces in their sneakers
Off the demeanor of Caesar smoking Great Barrier reefer
Till our lungs we catch seizures found ourselves in Pasadena
Reflecting on the times we spent, lusting over the finer shit
Though we might as well admit, this shit, It's gonna be hard to quit..
Truths an illusion I build a new Rome to be found in ruins
Thoughts of a human witnessing my own execution
Reduce the pollution in the midst of another revolution
Surrounded by my thoughts I find myself in some seclusion
Thoughts of her legs loosened, we come together like a reunion
I think her name was Susan, were her muses still in the music?
I had a stance, it was no time for all of the romance
We try to mend memories but the bonds linked were broken..
But I was hoping that our locks can be reopened
Cause the only time we're structured like poems is when we're smoking
Like, ever since the beginning, with these separate paths we're living
Like, the feelings that we're missing were only fractured by our distance
Like, why so revealing?
What are you concealing?
Like, what are you hearing that got your mind so appealing
Pride told me break it off, go ahead and take the charge
That's lately what I'm feeling when there's liquor and feelings involved
She got my attention like a motion picture
Just by that the way her body curves like punctuation, her gift is amazing
Know that I'm doping and scoping hoping I pave a way for her graces
Just to take me to a couple places
Like a, misunderstanding I takeoff when I be landing
And when the walls fall down I'll be right here where I'm standing
The hopes of a happy ending, depending on whether or not
Defending cause I'm ascending past your perspective
But as a collective, they say my style is just too modest
But really I call it paying homage
Fighting for the ones left without a promise
Capture the knowledge baby I swear they can never find us
Sweating like saunas we take a trip out to the Bahamas
As we, ease away the drama now my vision like Nostradamus
Third eyes and chakras paint the portals with marijuana..
