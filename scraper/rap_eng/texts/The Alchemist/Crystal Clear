Therapytherapper supposed to be my best friend

All the way until the end

But disses me cause he has a family to fend

The guy is 15 and already has a kid

But he tries to get rid of me just cause im trash

Fuck therapy, kanye and fuck alchemist to

Because they dont know about half the shit i’ve been through

Sayin i dont have much of a rapper life

Even though i’ve had one worse then you

I was bullied for a living, yeah and beat to

Oh boo who

Your dad beat you

Let me tell you something thats true

My dad beat my mom like a fucking rag doll

He kicked her ass and threw her into the drywall

While i sat their and had to watch it all

My mom had to walk to work with 2 black and blue eyes

Just wishing my dad dies

While all yours did was leave and not come back

I haven't seen mine since i was 5

Now my shoulders hold the weight of the load

And while i strive to support my family

Your on stage live away from yours

You already have  4 albums all of them are trash

Yeah ill give you credit for being able to smash and mash the people you diss and let them have it

But when the words come out of your mouth they sound like shit

You made this personal by using kirsten as bate

But at least i had a girlfriend unlike this under weight

Slim pimply headed bitch who’s heart is filled with hate

I’ve had as much as i can tolerate

Awwe, you wrote a love song called can’t get over you

But the girl wants nothing to do with you

And their isnt shit you are able to do

To change her mind

You must be going blind if you can’t notice

You better get out your pen and note this

Collision is officially done

Cause im number one

I may be signed by alchemist and your signed by kanye

But their is no way im gonna let you get the best of me

Now their is hell to pay

Because you even thought of bringing rebbeka in the middle of this

Im gonna say this one more time at least i had a mrs

I might not have many songs so this one will be my main

You made a song called love but pain

What did she do did she break your heart

Take it then rip it and crush it like a peice of bark

Then try and burn it by throwing it in a fire

If you dont care about rap and she is what you desire

Then why just sit their and let her walk away

You cry day after day

Because your best friend died, but nobody cares

I hope he burns in hell just like everyone else who dares

To take me on one on one

Looks like i already won

You must have big “dreams”

Look into your mirror before it cracks cause all your life is is a meme

Behind your back everyone is laughing at you like they’re a team

So while your writing to blow off steam

People are yelling (you suck) cause your as horrible as satan

The only reason you got signed by kanye is because of peyton

You should stop having her fight your battles for you

She may be stuck to you like glue

But sooner or later the bitch will leave you too

I am the bully of my own story

Your lyrics are good but good enough to bore me

Ill give you credit your diss hit me hard, you must have been on a rampage

You have all the guts to say things over text but not on stage

In front of thousands of people ready to hear you

You choke and run to the bathroom

Like b rabbit from 8 mile

But your not even close to marshall, your like a hobo, you even got its style

You got arrested for beating a kid with a pole and almost had to go on trial

You steal other peoples lines to put into your raps

And even when you steal eminem’s lines no one claps

Its like you have a never ending cycle

You make a ton of money and still ride to school on a bicycle

I might have anger issues but ill never stop yelling

Not until i quit selling

And live in a cardboard box

On the side of the streets getting picked by hawks

So looks like your gonna be deaing with me for a long time

Don’t try and diss me again until you learn to rhyme and spit a good line

Oh looks like you fell in Kanyes trap

He’s gonnna stick to you like tree sap

And tell you your the best at rap

But really he’s using you and is gonna throw you out like table scraps

Therapy i got you pinpointed, your like a map cause your easy to read

Your not even as close to as good as i am, your not even in the same breed

The only reason you are dissing me is cause your in need and want money

But what you don’t realize is their is nothing you can take from me

Let me make something crystal clear

Im not going anywhere im staying here

So calm down, shut up and take a seat little boy

Yout nothing but a toy that everyone plays with

I’m the king and don’t feel like giving up my thrown just yet

Because to me your not even a threat

Your not even on my fucking radar

I dont want to hear you anymore, you said it yourself your life is hopeless

And you want to die, problem is your one rope less from doing it

So ill do it for ya

Which way do you want to go out, raw or extra bloody

You won't stand a chance cause i can diss and beat you at the same time while i study
