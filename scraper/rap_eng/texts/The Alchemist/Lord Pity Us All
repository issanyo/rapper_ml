[Verse 1:]
You down with that
And let you go and put you down[x2]
You ain't down with that
Shut your Goddamn ass up
And let you go and put you down[x4]
And let you go to the devil
And let you go and put you down[x4]
And let you go
The devil is a mothafuckin liar
And let you go and put you down[x2]
And let you go to the devil

[Chorus:]
Lord pity us all
In this hard road (the devil is a mothafuckin liar) we got to travel
Cause you know I ainâ€™t worried, bitch
Stupid bitch

[Bridge:]
And let you go and put you down[x3]
And let you go and put you down (the devil is a mothafuckin liar)
And let you go and put you down
And let you go to the devil

[Chorus:]
Lord pity us all
In this hard road (the devil is a mothafuckin liar) we got to travel
You kiddin me
Like I said I come in the name of Jesus by the power of the holy spirit
