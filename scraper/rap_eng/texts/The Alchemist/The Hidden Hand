[Intro]

[Verse 1: Alchemist]
Digging through the dumpster like a transient
Another man down, there go the ambulance
Just scrape him off the road
Catch me on the stove, cooking and scrambling
Your dogs only bark, they just woofing and rambling
The Caballero's canvas
I keep shitting like a senior citizen with Pampers
Serving 'em like Pete Sampras
Over the net with the racket
Like I'm Federal Expressin' a package
My laboratory's far from lavish
Littered with dutch intestine, and blunt ashes
The way I just slip in Electric Slide through the gutter
Need rubber the largest
Every size and every color
Step the fuck back while I'm pushing the limitation
Speed demon - a 911 Porsche, horses racing
Violate a record like forced penetration
My liver is Russian, my lungs is Dutch
Team Thorough,my  number one and two sons clutch
I sit back, eating my lunch, not doing much
Cameras I spit in, my hand is hitting

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Oh No]
Can't see shit
That boy's gritty on the grizzy
Grinding out for the grams, dammit
Gamble with God, I'm pulling the cards, the hand's gambit
You get the poker face
Unless I'm high up out the atmosphere
But it takes a lot to get me there
Spark a flare but I can't calling for help
Like Adrian, I'm whooping ass, y'all go and grab me my belt
I'll son you
I swear there's no where to run to
When I hunt you, you're lunch food
Now look what it had come to
A little violence before we at peace
It's human ways, I call it laws of the streets
Capiche? Preach
Your mouth in the beef
You're burger-made, I murder them
Police knock and ask any questions, I never heard of them
I keep that Mary moving
Showing improvement, nigga rolling stupid
Highly ignorant when his mind is useless
You got something to prove? Prove it
I'm like the bad teacher to a student
That's white chalking, I'm not talking
The only options: live and learn
Y'all not of my concern
I'm sitting like Big Worm, come get burned
Man who did it, my hand is hittin'
