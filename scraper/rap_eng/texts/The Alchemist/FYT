[Verse]
Yeah, okay, consider this my mission statement
Infiltratin’ this business we call entertainment
Show you better than I can tell you, let me demonstrate it
A renegade, against the grain, call it innovative
Dipped in the latest, got me feeling like the kid that made it
Grippin’ the stainless 9 milli for you niggas, hatin’
Twist up a vega, reminiscin’ ‘bout the many places
I visited, and all the sistas that I penetrated
Intimidating these imitators for violating
This occupation finna turn me to a mental patient
Simply amazing how I keep your brain stimulated
My enemy: should him or humiliate him?
Strip him naked on the strip, make him kiss the pavement
Who poppin’ shit? Put your lips on this nickel plated
Back in the city, hit the block, what’s the situation?
It’s a drought and I need to get this paper—just for your information
