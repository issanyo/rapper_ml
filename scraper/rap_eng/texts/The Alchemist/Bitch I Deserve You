[Intro: Action Bronson]
I mean man, I made 872 million off molasses yesterday
Straight up
I’m only rhymin cause I’m nice
I don’t even give a shit no more
We on our way

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Look at the game say bitch I deserve you
Here forever, that's my word boo
I know my words slurring now but when I sober up
I just called to see how the fuck you've been holding up

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
I know you heard your boy's been hopping out the Rover truck
Long remove from when I rode the bus
Now I'm diving up in Polish sluts
With the gorgeous butts
And she love it when I throw her in the Cobra clutch
Window half down
Smoke trickle out
Stripper vixen out the blouse
Put the pickle in the pouch
No more sushi, style reserved for the past days
Big joints filled with hash in my ashtrays
We still fam' though we chose different pathways
I heard you're sniffing
Cleaning plates like the Cascade
Death's the only thing that's certain
Once was the cash fades
Fuck it, I'm getting money til my last days

[Hook x2: Action Bronson and Evidence]

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Your number changed and I ain't recognized the ringtone
So pardon for the unannounced
The rain, you know I've been gone
Flip the fucking beat up
I was looped around the planet
In the coupe with the cannon
With the car and the camera
Paparazzi never flashed
The days are way beyond us
Fact, they never flash and I'm below the surface, honest
Never blast my way out
I stroll out, pull by
Under the nose of anybody that knows not
Check-in's out of courtesy cause these are not requirements
Wait until our time is up; iron and the niacin
Boomer Esiason, flying out the Lion's den
This is weird science, inside a siren's blend
I hit the solid ten, water just a little splashing
Loop it up and bring it back man, cause this is Action

[Hook: Evidence]
