[Verse 1]:

Niggas broke off some rabbits
Went up north with habits
And then turn from boss to average
Can't afford, then you ain't got what it cost to have it
When a love of a family members' loss its tragic
Digging in my pocket tryna find a knot
Moved a little minor rock
Cause they was only scrapping on a minor block
Playing in the building, Transforming pain into millions
Off dimes of chocolate, What a feeling
High-top harlems with the strap still on em
No baggies, capsules, wrestlin' and slap skills
Everybody bussed it
Fried baloney sandwich with the mustard
Shit, either you ate or you flushed it
Think about it those were the best days
On the phone with shorty
While you ironing your clothes for the next day
Lunch money turned into pack money, Dudes I was cool with starting to act funny
Honeys wanna hit, So they starting to scrap for me
Imagine what its gonna be when I get this rap money
Looking up to whoever was known for cooking up
You could be taken in, or you could be tooken up
Stand firm like a man , Never get shooken up
Swear you can make it my nigga...Just look at us
What goes around comes around again
Know the same rule applies from now till then

[Verse 2]:

Yo... Now its getting spooky
It switched to the Acura, Integs and Suzuki's
'Lotta Ninos and Pookies
Dapper Dan... Silks and Bally's
Ropes Dookie
Whoever was in office was letting it flow loosely
Sent crack, Some niggas came home then went back
Thugged out, shit wasn't the same so they bugged out
I don't wanna rush into it
Looking at my uncles and cousins do it
Thinking to myself, "There's nothing to it"
Now I gotta pager, And the minor rock turned major
Cause the fiends is looking for the flavor
Nice little run with the crew, Money wasn't coming fast as i wanted it to
So I fell back, Took a deep breath
Inhaled rap, Waited for a spot to open up and held that
Even tho, it's still a lotta bumps in the road yo'
Everything is well-earned, Nothing is old though
Think about it, while cleaning and loading the 4-4
Reality is, Death is convienent to most folks
The torch is lit, And me? I'm just fortunate
To be in it for this long still scorching shit
Every verse is food, Every song is dinner
I belong with winners, Only the strongest finish
So you could be cool or you can wild till the end
But the same rules apply, From now till then
