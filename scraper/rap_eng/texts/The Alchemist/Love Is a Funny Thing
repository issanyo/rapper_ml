("No more music by the suckers")

[Verse 1: Evidence]
They say love is a funny thing
But what's funny is the company that money brings
Every year my circle's getting smaller
Not Ben Baller but never had a thin wallet
I got dollars in different forms of currency
I got problems, but ain't nothing that worry me
And I ain't saying that I'm worry-free
I'm just saying nothing's fucking with me currently
Shit, I'm my own worst enemy
I make bread just to spend it like it's ten of me
It's Evidence and people call me by my government
Call me for weed, but don't call me for that other shit
Absorb the game that was meant to be sold
Not told, I heard good fortune favors the bold
So I'm standing in the rain, gambling the game
In the circle rolling dice with a hand full of gold and we go

[Hook: Khrysis]
You say you love me, do you really though?
You just want the world I'm sitting on
Are you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?
I don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong
You say you love me, do you really though?
You just want the world I'm sitting on
Are you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?
I don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong

[Verse 2: Styles P]
You say you love me, but do you though?
Truly though, I see your eyes you let a shooter go
They'll try to catch me when I'm slipping with the toolie, yo
I just want a Gangsta's Paradise like I'm Coolio
Told my nigga Evidence, I don't leave no evidence
Not a trace, but they gon' know the Wraith was in their residence
The revenant, comes for the settlement, niggas is so irrelevant
They gon' try to use you, they gon' want your watch
And your chain and your shoes too, niggas will straight abuse you
They gon' stand there and act like they paid dues too
If you're right, then stay right
If you're wrong, then get gone, my nigga, then so long
Do you really want the best for me?
Are you happy when niggas' testing me?
You just trying to figure out my recipe
You will never get it, just bounce, nigga, you're stressing me

[Hook: Khrysis]
You say you love me, do you really though?
You just want the world I'm sitting on
Are you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?
I don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong
You say you love me, do you really though?
You just want the world I'm sitting on
Are you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?
I don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
If I wasn't on this wave, if I didn't have this come up
Would you love me if I didn't have 9th or Alicia's number?
If I wasn't with the Roc, would you run and tell your friends
That you know me and I'm hot? Would I be in your Top 5?
Would you hit me back or see me later and tell me you forgot?
If I wasn't in that flick standing in front of the ride
Would you wanna make up if we had failed like you had thought?
Would you by my single on iTunes and pay $1.20-something?
Are you like the rest, sheep, blind leading the blind?
Would you praise me even if I didn't have a Dre co-sign?
Tell me what you want: new shoes or free tickets?
Don't ask me again, hit Dave if you want Kendrick
I know real love, I listen to Mary J
I can't carry you too, baby, ain't none of you marry Jay
Every breakup don't make upâ€”the rest of you, Mary Kay
Screaming "Westside!", niggas gon' drive me crazy

[Hook: Khrysis]
You say you love me, do you really though?
You just want the world I'm sitting on
Are you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?
I don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong
You say you love me, do you really though?
You just want the world I'm sitting on
Are you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?
I don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong
