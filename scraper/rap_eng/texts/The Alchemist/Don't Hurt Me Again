Together we lost it
Our melanin together was better than awesome
But whatever, she cleverly Beverly Hills flossing
Me, Forever east-coast bossin’
And even under the weather, I’m the bomb, Boston
Like running up a hill marathon, you lost one
Like Lauryn up a hill marathon, you lost ones
I bet I still run through your mind as often
But not as often as sunsets you lost in
The Boulevard full of cars, girl you stalling
Like a cheesesteak line back in Philly, you drawlin'
Long distance, no time, who should I call then?
Priority minority, where do I fall in?

I’ve been misled before, it’s companionship issues
I hold grudges like bad lovers, don't let me resent you!
That's not Eric-like
Your love was not specific, it was very generic-like
Your excuse, you were getting your spirit right
Bullshit! our love mended our very spirits tight
Thinking with your eyes when I removed every fear in sight
Lookin' to the sky, your high revealed ya fear in heights
Bitch I'm Fahrenheit
I paint a picture clear and bright when you hear me write
But you ain't hear me, right?

I looked you dead in your eyes and I made you my life
Told you if you stayed with me I would make you my wife
Believed in you like God in that I'd never think twice
Believe me, that I tried and I could never suffice
Fuck the comfort of a bed
I was your comfort when you bled
Making a way for nothing;
Was left to suffer when you fled, alone
Forced to make a home while you roamed
Didn't bug your phone, left you ‘lone when you zoned

You were all you, I was all us
Never insecure, it was all trust
We were friends before
I guess that was all bluff
It was you who I adored
I guess that was too much

But yeah I wish she would've stayed
I wish she would've stayed!
She was fit to be a goddess
I wish I would've prayed
This is how feels when emotions are caged
Now I'm lost in the wind like smoke from the sage
I couldn’t write a song, my heart broke on the page
So much rain in my eyes from shade in my mind
Good guy turned savage, what shameful demise
Yeah, such shameful demise

The love I had for you just couldn't match
To a woman still attached
Still looking back
Still ducking facts
This is so fucking whack
I fought for you, but my heart was no fucking match

I know you'd rather light a match and just forget my part
Because it's easier to leave without the broken heart

This that vulnerable shit
This that going through shit
This that loving a person who don't belong to you shit
That deceiving you shit
Misleading you shit
Here’s to leaving a person who don't believe in you shit

This that vulnerable shit
This that going through shit
This that loving a person who don't belong to you shit
Then leaving you, shit
Switch teams on you quick
Here’s to leaving a person who don't believe in you, shit

Just let that shit go
Fake friends, fake love
That’s ‘bout as useful as fake snow
Superficial glow

Today I realized that nothing can only be defined by clear, never a color. Just a fly by of clarity that I couldn't seem to land in. Empty burdens seek out filled voids to dismantle. And when the truth raises suspicions, and the emphasis on efforts desist, you can find light in the transparency that lingers within your black and white, and finally, realize why I released you. No grey
