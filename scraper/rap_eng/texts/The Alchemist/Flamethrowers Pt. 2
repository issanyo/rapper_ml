[Intro]

[Verse 1: Oh No]
Look I see them gassed up like they're full of propane
Who reign? Nobody now, popped a hole up in up their butane
Explosions show you how to move things
Throw fire from the hand, Lui Kang
Bake up a cake like souffle
Reefer hot, blow off your toupee
Burn down the spot, it's a new day
Keep the sun on me, give 'em new waves
Who wait?
Radiation in veins the same that you [?] steak
Yo, Al cook a new plate

[Verse 2: Alchemist]
Spit off like a rotisserie, 180 turn
Shots fired, burn baby burn
Straighten the wave in your perm
Cigarillos bathing in sherm
I swim in a river riddled with germs
Stomach intestine infested with worms
Pissy pot, dirty kitchen breakfast is served bon appetite
[?] squeeze Pesto when I let go
Soldiers double back like it was an echo
Flamethrower barrel of petro with pair of a retros
Sergio Tacchini suit, no Escos
Double G penant just swing from the neck low
Down to the dugout dirt, put in work

[Hook]
We got fire, man
We got fire, what
We got fire, man
You don't want to try us, what
We got heat that gon' burn when you [?]
Flamethrowers, ain't no survivors, what
We got fire

[Verse 3: Oh No]
I ain't been sober since fifteen
Big flames aimed at [?]
Holding on that bost' cream
Moving at mach speed [?]
Lost breed, a big dragon ready to rock [?]
Higher than a lockheed aeroplane
I'm putting fire to the wounds like a pharoah cane
You see the torch is held up with the narrow frame
And the cards of fire was down a taroh plane
Yo Al, tell 'em mane

[Verse 4: Alchemist]
I tried to told 'em
Hundred racks stacks too large of a size to fold 'em
Hallucinogenic package, I sold 'em
Dynamite stick, explode 'em
For the bitches like frozen yogurt
[?] when I get over
The tunnel rat, I ride the track like a token holder
Then smash boulder
It's the return, third degree burn
Blew the reefer through the speaker
Smack it out of the park through the bleachers, male features
Car starter bombs char body parts on beaches
Flowing in a ocean with the fish feces
The flame level increases
You pay to stay, we only lease it

[Hook]
We got fire, man
We got fire, what
We got fire, man
You don't want to try us, what
We got heat that gon' burn when you [?]
Flamethrowers, ain't no survivors, what
We got fire
