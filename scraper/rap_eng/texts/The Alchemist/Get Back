[Hook: Eminem]
Get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
Get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better

[Verse 1: Proof]
Doing a box of doctrine, on stomping oxygen
? ? wit fork to your optic lens
Hitting wit a sudden force
Leave your boy laying in the same puddle of blood as yours
When I flood his porch
Smuggle a gun in court and shoot the judge
Easily reduce a thug to a future scrub
A double-deuce wit slugs, I'm Proof on drugs
We'll turn you to a rapper that we used to love
High on medicine cabinet pills
Grabbing the steel, leaping over buildings that haven't been built
I'm not the best yet cuz I haven't been killed
I'm laughing at you faggot-ass rapping for deals, you better

[Hook: Eminem]
Get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm disappointed in my dentist appointment
He only gave me the fucking gas for thirty minutes this morning
Went to the hospital to get a chest X-ray
Checked out the next day in a dress wit a sex change
I'm having a bad day
My fucking dad's gay, I hate fags, and I'm fucking mad cuz I don't have AIDS
All I want to do is die
I tried suicide six times and couldn't even do it right
Collapsed, had a relapse and called three cabs
And had to be dragged back to rehab wit bloody kneecaps
Enrolled myself in a twelve-step program
Tripped on the first step and got pinned down in a chokeslam
I swear to God, this 'Pac poster comes any closer
I'm kicking this whole fucking wall over
Two more shots and it's all over
I'm all over this wall, trying not to fall over

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
BLOAW BLOAW!
Shots in broad day
(BIZARRE, THAT'S YOUR MOM!)
The bitch shouldn't have been in the way
Me, Shady and Mike fucking a hemaphrodite
My little sister was a virgin till late last night
High off a kite off of stick of sherm
Put your mother in a full-nelson while my boys take turns
A unibomber trying to escape this country
Tell O.J. he better be coming up wit my money
Bizarre goes commercial? Nigga, you can forget it
B-- suck my *dick* that is the radio edit
I'm quick to smack the shit out of a foe
I ain't had pussy in a while, I'm too busy fucking assholes
Battle me, you better go eat your vegetables
I'm iller than a Muslim eating a pork hotdog in African festival
This shit is serious, watch me sniff 'cane
Avoid the pain and fuck a bitch barely potty-trained

[Hook: Eminem]
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get the fuck back

*Get back" *cut up and repeated*
