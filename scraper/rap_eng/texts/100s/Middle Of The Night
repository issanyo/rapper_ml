[Verse 1]
I'm looking for somebody I can get to know, get to know
Tell me baby can I get to you, get to you
And get to ya
And that time when you reach out for something new
Well it ain't about what you saying it's what you do
And you can, can't stop, with nothing but yourself
When do you think about it you, start to touch yourself
See you, asking you questions we already know the answers to

[Hook]
Now who is it you think of in the middle of the night?
Now who?
Now who is it you think of in the middle of the night?
When your eyes low and your head hits your pillow

[Verse 2]
See I ain't got the time, act now
If now you would be crazy
In this world they'll shoot you down in front of your baby
You know, you know, it's why you've been acting good
Why you walking around with that attitude?
And we came to your favorite song
Feeling right got you thinking twice

[Hook x 2]
Now who is it you think of in the middle of the night?
Now who?
Now who is it you think of in the middle of the night?
When your eyes low and your head hits your pillow

[Hook]
Now who is it you think of in the middle of the night?
(Now now now) Now who? Now who?
Now who is it you think of in the middle of the night?
When your eyes low and your head hits your pillow

[Verse 3]
I'm looking for somebody I can get to know, get to know
Tell me baby can I get to you, get to you, all night sexing you
I'm looking for somebody I can get to know, get to know
Tell me baby can I get to you, get to you, get to you
Somebody I can get to know
Somebody I can get to know
