[Verse 1]
Hit a quick hair flip and I'm disco style
Hoes  fallin' fast [?] fuckin' two [?]
Callin' me chronic and freshen up until you look right
Sittin' around quiet till a playa look right

[Pre-Chorus: 100s & (Cherub)]
I'll be your man
And keep you dripping wet, yeah
(I'll keep you dripping wet, yeah)
I'll be your man
And don't care what they say
(And don't care what they say)

[Chorus]
You got to know
There's a different type of love for you and I
You got to know
There's a different type of love that gets me high

[Verse 2]
Ice cold baby now you never need another man
Third world got the activator from the motherland
Gotta show you the cell before I show you the [?]
Now we on the same team right what's your number?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be your man
But they don't understand, uhh
They don't understand, uhh
I'll be your man
And they gon' have to let us be
I'll be your man
And they're just gonna have to see

[Chorus: 100s & (Cherub)]
You got to know
There's a different type of love for me and you
(Me and you I know I know aah)
You got to know
There's a different type of love gon' get us through
(A different type of love will get us through)

[Verse 3: 100s & (Cherub)]
See I don't care what you say about me
(I don't care what you say about me)
And it must be meant to be, because it came in three
Welcome to the IVRY

[?: 100s & (Cherub)]
You're my baby girl
(My baby)
My baby girl
My baby girl
(Oh ooh oh ohh)
You're my baby girl
(Mah baby girl)
My baby girl girl
(Mah baby girl)
Mah baby

[Outro: 100s & (Cherub)]
You got to know, there's a different type of love for you and I
(You're my baby girl)
(You're my baby girl)
You got to know, there's a different type of love that gets me high
(You're my baby girl)
(My baby girl)
(And you're my baby girl)
And you're my baby girl
