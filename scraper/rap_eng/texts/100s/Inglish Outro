[Verse 1: 100s]
You need to see way more than nigga rich, flip my bitch
Ho, you ain't seen a flick of wrist, all that
Them bitches know that I take 'em where they get bought at
Where niggas ball at, all that
Don't you hate that?
Getting calls while you're betting on a racetrack
I must admit it was a little hotter that day
Me and the miss was on the bitter, that day
At the gym when I came up on that head master
Getting it up on the stairmaster
I said hold on bitch before you hit that threadmill
And told her some shit that probably got her wet still
She had a small pussy but she could still take it
You ain't got to ball yet, the bitch could still make it
Now watch me make a toast to all that
With so many White girls they think it's self hatred
See I keep it tied up for the lames, that's the game
I prefer it fried up before I came, it's a lane
While I just sit back and you and the real daddy compete for the name
Me in a steel Caddy report to the gang
Cause I been been bad, smelling her pussy you know I been [?]
Maybe in the future all my hoes will be skin tagged
Carrying big bags before I cancel them sim bad
Thick head, she got some Indian in her
And I fucked her so good it brought out the Indian in her
I know my uncle be mad when it be ass instead of that
Niece up in the back, singing 99
Aim it at the game, not the player with the hatred
Mad she was getting hers while y'all were still dating
Now watch me make a toast to all that
With so many Black girls, they think it's self hatred
