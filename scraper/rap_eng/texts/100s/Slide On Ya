[Verse 1]
See some hoes that I used to hit, back in high school
Used to take me to the mall, right by school
They said we heard you doin' bigger things now
Bigger things now, all that, rap n sing now
How long is you in town? (in town)
See it in they face, they was with the get down
Whats yo number then? Ready? Type!
She said I got you, wait its 5-1-0 right?
Yuh, hit me round 12, then she smiles
Like somethin she want went on sale
100s make the music you can rock to you can knock to
Let me roll, that's a big 10-4
Do you accept the charges
Yes, I will
Then when you get out
We gon' play on still
But when you get out you got to chill
Knock a bitch up in the hills that'll pay your bills
And thats real

[Hook]
I'll ride with ya, I'll ride with ya but to
Slide on ya, its just me n my niggas
(slide on ya)

Ring,ring,who is this?
Ring,ring,hello (hello)
Where I'm at? Who is you to know?
Anyway, bitch, I'm at the studio
State yo name, state yo game
Business is state yo (???)
State yo sign, state yo job, what you make
Cus u gotta get down to fuck with me
Is it an issue?
Me and my girls fucked up so I hit you
Heard about couple thangs that we might do
But if you free later maybe u could slide thru
What's the address? I'm gon' slide
U just make sure yo friends ain't shy
Slipped through n fucked all them hoes then switched
Neighbors bang til they call them poes, thank that bitch

[Hook x2]
What I say?
