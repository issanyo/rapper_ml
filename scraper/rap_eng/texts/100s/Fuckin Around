I think it's time I let you know
That it's time I let you go
Bitch don't come around here no mo'
Ooo, I just can't get with you
If you ain't got nothing for me
Then bitch you don't mean nothing to me
Countin' money, I be lovin' the sound
Oh yeah nigga then we ain't be fuckin' around

Fuckin' around, fuckin' around, fuckin' around
We ain't fuckin' around
Fuckin' around, fuckin' around, fuckin' around

[Verse 1]
Hand out the window when the 'Lac came
It's the mack mayne, and he fly like a motherfuckin' bat wing
All to me, cause she tryna make the mack rang
Callin me, cause she wanna get the bad thang
Bitch you got a 9 to 5
Boulevard or driveway ride? Whatchu drive?
See that Sub-D what get 'em all like that
Whatchu think this is? You think I hit 'em all like that?
She know I lick, rub, and fuck her ass. Right?

She said 100s but I love yo ass
But that ain't gon' get my hair done

[Hook]

Countin' money, I be loving the sound
Oh yeah nigga then we ain't be fuckin' around

[Verse 2]
See the bitch came through tryna hang with me
The bitch came through tryna swang with me
I need the finer things, if not oh well
Chez Panisse, Claremont Hotel
Never let the coat drag
Peelin' out a ho pad
Nigga where it come from?

R.I.P. but nah it ain't enough for me
Motherfuck the judge, fuck the jury, and the police
Uh, the bitch took me on a light splurge
Jive nigga had to tell her bye nigga
Who said the best things in life are free?
Must of never met a motherfucker like me

[Hook]
I think it's time I let you know
That it's time I let you go
Bitch, don't come around here no mo'
Ooo I just can't get with you
If you ain't got nothing for me
