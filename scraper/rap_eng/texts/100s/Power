Power, Power, Power
Money, cars, clothes, hoes
Fuck I need a friend for?
Power, Power, Power
Living life reckless
Cuz a nigga rather be feared than respected

Power nigga, yea it's conquer time
Bury me in all gold with my concubines
In the center of military convoy
Clear the streets, yea this nigga wanted power
Since he was a small boy
Everything I'm buying I can buy it tens times
In a fortress, on an island, because the powers all mine
My momma called she said "never shit in your bed
Why you never call? cuz the power got to your head"
Said "I gotta call you back" niggas ain't hearing that
Once you tasted power than there's really no going back
Got a down bitch, hot body, how i'm feeling:
Since i got the power  i don't give a fuck about her feelings
She said a nigga changed, and I said "bitch, just stop complaining
Because you wasn't saying shit when we vacationed in the Caymans"
She said that I disgust her, and she threw my ring back at me
I just sparked a honey, poured up, and then laughed at her:
Power

Power, Power, Power
Money, cars, clothes, hoes
Fuck I need a friend for?
Power, Power, Power
Living life reckless
Cuz a nigga rather be feared than respected

Threesome in a glass shower
Foaming off the past hour
Do some powder then i hit the club to feel more power
Bottle in my hand, shirt off yelling "west side"
Feeling like a god, bitch, feeling like I can't die
Unstable, feeling incomplete without the money
Fuck the world, they just trying to take the power from me
My right hand telling me slow down please
Thinking I don't' know he fucked my bitch while he was overseas
Cancel that nigga, cancel that bitch
Never played you nigga, I fucking made you nigga
But I ain't really tripping, man, I treat it like a misdemeanor
Niggas say they lost me once I let the power get between us
Twenty five, bay power never taking nights off
Watch a nigga pulling up behind me with the lights off
Fucking shots fired, it's the end for me
Shit, i guess the power was the end of me

[Verse 3: J. Folks]
See, I come from the front, hit his neck with the pump
Put his head on the roof, and his body in the trunk
Went straight for his sixes, never rinsed the ??? off
Threw them big bitches in my 'Lac then I rode off
Nigga I'm a mac, every bitch know i get payed
I got the dubs on my back, like MJ
Back in his day, yes I'm back with the K
Keep hating till your legs and your waste get separated
That's when you gon' really hate me, that was just an illustration
Coming at me indirect, nigga what you in for death?
Nigga, and you don't want it with the blood hounds
East bound town nigga with the long pounds
Long rounds, put your mind on the ground
For a really long time on my side of the town
And it's gonna be a while before the rollers arrive
And he gon' give me his attire when I pull out the five, nigga
Power
