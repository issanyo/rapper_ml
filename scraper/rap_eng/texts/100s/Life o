[Intro]
In the Life of a Mack...
In the life of mack...

[Verse 1]
Swear a bitch will always want some more
Take a piss, wash my dick, then I'm out the fucking door
Stiff one arm hug, nothin' mushy
Gotta jet dick still smellin' like pussy
Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up
Now i'm looking through my nigga's nest, tryna' find a cigarette
Breakfast date with Nicolette, but she gotta hold
Because a nigga blew his last one, I gotta cop and pack some
It took a two-egger to mack that bitch
Nigga watch and observe my mack antics
She ain't-she ain't never seen nothing like this
Two braids, west coast, straight bumping like this
It was almost two I had to go anyway
But before I left it was something I had to say
Your daddy rich huh, tell him that you mess with me
Tell him that i'm next up, he need to come invest in me

[Hook]
Straight making that money
Straight making that money
Young players getting raised out here
And all the chicken head bitches wanna braid my hair
Straight taking that money
Straight taking that money
It's all good, no sweat off my back
Because it's just another day, in the life of a mack

[Verse 2]
It's almost three I had her waiting for nothin'
So now she's cryin' and fussin', she thinks i'm fucking her cousin
I said hold up, can you prove that? Bitch are you sure?
The last time I saw that bitch was back in 2004
She was bad you can't blame it on shit
Since back when, Freek-A-Leek was on the radio and shit
If I remember correctly, don't ever sweat me
Don't think I won't turn your broken heart into confetti
Around six got a call from an unknown
Must have been some ancient bitches playing up on my phone
Hit the store and got a bottle of rum
They gave it to me because they knew me
Motherfucker I ain't twenty-one
Had to kill it feeling made right now
Then went on a drunk mission to my main bitch house
Got some pussy then I passed out
Woke up and hit it again because she was sleeping with her ass out

[Hook]
