[Verse 1]
At it again in that le Sabre, momma Jewish
But I'm still black up on them papers
They gon' flag me down
Put me out then pat me down
Black and white, undercover, them just my cigarettes
Thank you brother
Motherfucker, bounce
He probably mad a nigga like me all up in his house, right now
Daughter came back from college, with that knowledge
Jungle fever got her on her back
And she went black, she never went back
Kiss that foe. And pick another target if you miss that ho
You gon' mug around; another nigga gonna list that ho
And you gonna be mad as fuck if you went raw when you hit that ho
Jaw locked up, I can't make an appearance
I'm too busy on the balcony, drunk, screaming my lyrics
And you gon' know when you hear it, I got that voice that make them hoes
Rub on they self and then cum on they self
I'm trying to ball like I got a degree in something in common that it's a high demand for
But not with your hands, though
Threesome popped off with two these hoes
A nigga never slithered away, I let them scissor away

[Hook]
And you feel it all in your nose
And that drip go hard down your throat
And you smell it all on your clothes
And kiss slow while kissin nymphos
Some niggas out there listin these hoes
Some niggas out there missin these hoes
Most niggas out there friends with they foes
And kiss slow while kissin nymphos

[Verse 2]
Yeah I got another 16 in it, and uh
Yeah my Brock got another 16 in it
And I just want something cool with some TVs in it
So I can park, watch porn and then see me gettin it
Saw my big cousin, from back in the day
Strung out on that shit, it's all love, I gave him dub, and two cigarettes
And a meal to keep him strong
And I told him "be safe," I'll do more when I'm on
Then it hit me, trippin' and shit
I might just nod off and then nod on, I mean sipping this shit
I need bed and some head and a jacket and ring
With a fine bitch to match it, among other things

[Voice over]
This some player music, fresh gator music
That 78, 5th floor, elevator music

That don't do what you won't do but you will do what I ask you
In that same day that I max you, I put it out there

Let me roll let me roll let me bounce let me roll
Let me roll let me roll let me bounce let me roll
Let me roll
While this shit take it's toll
And I get all lost in your soul

[Hook]
And you feel it all in your nose
And that drip go hard down your throat
And you smell it all on your clothes
And kiss slow while kissin nymphos
Some niggas out there listin' these hoes
Some niggas out there missin these hoes
Most niggas out there friends with they foes
And kiss slow while kissin nymphos
