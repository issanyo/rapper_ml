[Verse 1]
Perm on my back, rollin' through these streets
Never pack heat; I shoot when I speak (But my nigga might)
Over, shimmy shakin' that shoulder
Straight up, bolder, it's Folger's, now wake up
Just a young M-A-C, so feel it when I spill
And the last time I checked your love don't pay no bills
And that's real, be punctual (Right)
'Cause a nigga gotta be comfortable
Rather have ten rich pennies than a broke dime
She sunk, put a bitch on to this P funk and it blew her mind
And I wish they taught you this in school
How I shake, shim, move and keep that cool
There's a lot of paths you could walk down
But in this one you'll find, any situation can be talked down
Gotchu and it's like that
Mad, hang up, but I know you'll call right back

[Chorus]
And naw, not the nigga that'll make you change your name
But you'll never want another 'cause the game, it flow through my veins
And naw, not the nigga that'll make you change your name
But you'll never want another 'cause the game, it flow through my veins

[Verse 2: 100s]
And let me tell you why, the rhythm and the rhymes
Can only be defined by a mack in real time
I'm good I ain't gotta complain stain
And bitches can't understand when I'm talkin' in Bay slang
Can you repeat it? Can you eat it 'fore you beat it? (Nah, chill)
Bitch, you gotta pay before I spray (That's real)
But I can never knock the next man
Who gon' trick on them hoes until he got a bed pan
But see me, I can't, and I won't, get fucked
You ain't got it, then you can't, and you won't, get tugged
See me I'm steppin' in fly
And I can show you a whole lotta shit; open your eyes

[Interlude]
Playa playa playa, play on, ah
Playa playa playa, play on, ah

[Chorus]
And naw, not the nigga that'll make you change your name
But you'll never want another 'cause the game, it flow through my veins
And naw, not the nigga that'll make you change your name
But you'll never want another 'cause the game, it flow through my veins

[Outro]
You know I'll be around
