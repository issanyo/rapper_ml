[Intro]
See this shit, is gonna take us out the game
But there are rules to the house
Number one: Never leave this produce in the house
Number two: Get your own crew
Number three: Gotta have discipline in your crew, trust, gotta be tough on 'em
Number four: Don't praise a nigga too much otherwise he gonna think you soft
Rule number five: Don't show no love

[Verse 1- Joey Fatts]
Tell me what you need I got it for cheap
But if you see them D's you ain't cop from me
First they G's, hit the stand and then they cop a plea
So it's just me, just how it supposed to be the pusha man
Anything you can't sell I bet this pusha can
And anything I can't mail I pack up in the van
Don't need a scale niggas eye ballin grams
Experience with the chemist been cooking since we was kids
Selling white and selling mids I'm the future in this biz
They trying to turn out my lights but this hustle never end
Police got these niggas changing swear that we were never friends
Coke amazing junkies racing just to sniff this shit again
I'm your pusha but when it's beef I'm the butcher
Chop a nigga block down it's probably why the cops round
Coke dro and other drugs for the low
When they see me on the go niggas know

[Hook: 100s]
I'm yo pusha baybay, yo pusha baybay
I'm yo pusha baybay, yo pusha baybay
I'm yo pusha baybay, yo pusha baybay
I'm yo pusha baybay, yo pusha baybay
Everybody wave your hands at the pusha man

[Verse 2- F1]
I'm a grinder
Push it all from Qs to the whole thing
Five for the O and fifteen for the whole thing
Push it OT, first stop is Spokane
Flood it with water works but switch spots to move cane
Terra hoe is ice cold, they looking for snow
So I flood the scene with fresh Q, half and Os
Out the pyrex, standing over the stove in the projects
14 grams of baking soda in the pyrex
28 grams of cocaine up in the pyrex
Add a little H-2-0, you know what comes next
Rocks dogs, you know I can't be stopped
I'm a chef when I'm standing in the kitchen over grandwarx pot
Gotta a safe is the closet at grandma's spot
Fireproof so its safe if the block gets hot
And if the feds get hot its time to shake the spot
Switch blocks just to move the hop
Yup, the grind don't stop

[Verse 3: 100s]
Some say his business is cold in the crime
He makes as much as your dentist and roll in Benzes with bitches
Who about his money, don't push the man
And everybody slap five with the pusher man
Got a phone for the hoes and a phone for the fiends
Be it coke, lean, pussy and weed, he got what you need
Don't trust a motherfucker, he off in the game alone
You ready he'll front and help put you on
Pusha man will tell you that it's grown man business
If you want to call about some money every ten minutes
Fast money non stop, till the clock stop
What he got will make a nigga gloc pop in his drop top
He the nigga everybody know up in your town
The nigga hoes fear when they put their head down
The nigga on the block that could cop that for you
The nigga up on the block that say I got that for you
