[Verse 1]
See, an ass like that take control of me
Fuckin' them hoes, fuckin' them hoes, fuckin' them hoes
Fuckin' them hoes to that Jodeci
Get it rock on me
Make it pop on me, you the only one? Bitch, lookin' like the golden one
Have we met before? You sure you don't owe me one?
Fuck a nigga bitch, you don't like that, huh?
Day Like this you couldn’t write that, huh?
Hit a nigga real hard
When he call three times, she ain't write back one
Damn no. Bitch say she was a fan, no!
Buy my CD, I was fuckin' a bitch, fuckin' a bitch
And she started saying lines from the ICP
See, an ass like that will make a nigga quit his job say fuck them kids
Come home late wit his head down, actin' all funny
He know what he did!
You know I gotta wax that, before I gotta tax that
Fuck a bitch like the IVRY nigga
Back there by the I.V. nigga, like that

[Hook]
Pop, pop, V.I., V.I
(Can a nigga hit it?)
Pop, pop, V.I., V.I
(and Bitch is you gon let me in it?)
Pop, pop, V.I., V.I
(Can a nigga hit it?)
Pop, pop, V.I., V.I
(Can I be jealous or go crazy?)
Pop, pop, V.I., V.I
(Can I be yo nigga, you my baby?)
Pop, pop, V.I., V.I., V.I., V.I

[Bridge]
All the bitches pop that ass
You know a nigga be fuckin' them hoes
And a bitch be like right there
You know I like that
You know I gotta work that ass
Tell a bitch I finna pimp, talkin' bout how I ain’t serve that ass

[Verse 2]
Bitch ass trick, make a nigga wanna throw somethin' at that bitch
Bitch ass thick, make a nigga wanna blow somethin' at that bitch
What it feel like, I'm curious, curious
Bad furious, pay the fee, so I know that you serious
I'm the type of nigga that will chase a bitch
I'm the type of nigga that will lace a bitch
They be like why 100s, always on a bitch mind or lips
Cause a nigga be
Fuckin' these hoes, fuckin' these hoes, fuckin' these hoes
Like this

[Hook]
