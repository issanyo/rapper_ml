[Intro]
In the life of a mack
In the life of a mack

[Verse 1]
I swear a bitch will always want some more
Take a piss, wash my dick, then I'm out the fuckin' door
Stiff one, arm hug, nothin' mushy
Gotta jet, dick still smellin' like pussy
Speed it up, speed it up, speed it up
Now I'm lookin' through my nigga nest, tryna find a cigarette
Breakfast date with Nicolette, but she gotta hold
Because a nigga blew his last one
I gotta cop and pack some
It took a two-egger to mack that bitch
Nigga, watch and observe my mack antics
She ain't, she ain't never seen nothin' like this
Two braids, West Coast, straight bumpin' like this
It was almost 2, I had to go anyway
But before I left, there was somethin' I had to say
"Your daddy rich, huh? Tell 'em that you mess with me
Tell him that I'm next up, he need to come invest in me."

[Hook]
Straight makin' that money
Straight makin' that money
Young playas gettin' raised out here
And all the chicken-head bitches wanna braid my hair
Straight takin' that money
Straight takin' that money
It's all good, no sweat off my back
‘Cause it's just another day in the life of a mack

[Verse 2]
It's almost 3, and I had her waitin' for nothin'
So now she cryin' and fussin'
She think I'm fuckin' her cousin
I say, "Hold up, can you prove that? Bitch, are you sure?
The last time I saw that bitch was back in 2004."
She was bad, you can't blame it on shit
Since back when Freak-A-Leek was on the radio and shit
If I remember correctly, don't ever sweat me
Don't think I won't turn your broken heart into confetti
Round 6, got a call from an unknown
Must've been some ancient bitches playin' up on my phone
Hit the store and got a bottle of rum
They gave it to me ‘cause they knew me
Motherfucker, I ain't 21
Had to kill it, feelin' made right now
Then went on a drunk mission to my main bitch' house
Got some pussy, then I passed out
Woke up and hit it again
‘Cause she was sleepin' with her ass out

[Hook]
Straight makin' that money
Straight makin' that money
Young playas gettin' raised out here
And all the chicken-head bitches wanna braid my hair
Straight takin' that money
Straight takin' that money
It's all good, no sweat off my back
‘Cause it's just another day in the life of a mack
