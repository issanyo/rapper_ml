100s, let's do it

Nigga, it's the bowtie killa
Leather Jacket Mike Jack Thrilla

Licensed dick dealer, Miller cap peala
Blowin hundreds in the presence of niggas that rap, killa
Late night hunts for cunts, hoes, and dick feelers

Nigga, it's the one double O, what the shit do? (100s)
You don't know a nigga name, but ya bitch do
And she ain't even 'forty-two' when I slid through
Now the bitch'a line up on the page I done flipped through

Nigga, I'm raw like the night you fucked up
What you left up in that bitch' that she shoulda sucked up

Bad hipster hoes shoppin' at the thrift store
Skinny nigga permed up, ashin' out the window

One laced up, niggas asked me how I learned that
Fuck 'em from the back, and when I'm cummin tell her "turn back"

Nigga, I'm a cold mack, get it how how you live, huh
But I never slip they tryna have a nigga' kid, huh

Bad hipster hoes shoppin' at the thrift store
Skinny nigga permed up, ashin' out the window

But I never slip they tryna have a nigga' kid, huh
