[Verse 1]
Got a 1999 bitch
In my suite they shake it like it's 1999 shit
Like I'm on the set of "Big Pimpin'" in 2000
She got her income tax back I want 2,000
Bitch I'm finna slide through
Fix a nigga Thai food
If you can't do Thai food
Fix a nigga fried food
Let me take off my shoes
Let me set down my jewels
100s finna light you
And never call or write you
Suck my dick up on the dance floor like it's '95
She said I got that good hair, bitch I get that shit a lot
Throwback nigga like a jheri curl in the summer
As I'm speedin' nigga yellin' I'm the number one stunna
Slappin' 400 hundred degrees
Runnin' them bitches in threes
Takin' em out on the seas
In nothin' but their bra strings
I like my dick sucked fast
I like to fuck 'em in the ass while he beat up the pussy and that's all

[Hook]
Bitch shake that ass like it's 1999
Like it's, Like it's 1999
Niggas throwin' cash like it's 1999
Like it's, Like it's 1999
Throwback
So bad
Hahuh hahuh
Holla at a Mack
Niggas fucked up
All my niggas is beside me
100s got the hoes shakin' ass like the '90s

[Bridge]
Holla at a 3rd world mack
Holla at a 3rd world mack
Bounce that ass and I'mma let that motherfucker burn
Skinny ass nigga with a dick as long as my perm

[Verse 2]
Ho that she was bangin' cause she had 9 inches off the head
100s came to bust up on your face and on your fucking legs
Fill that Jacuzzi with groupies
Like shit you see in the movies
Kick 'em out like Boosie ho
If they ain't tryna tootsie roll
Where's Sydney and Sherane?
Wh-Where's Sydney and Sherane?
I'mma do my thang 'till the DJ yells switch
Then uh, slide right behind yo bitch
The roof on fire nigga, we don't need no water ho
100s got the hoes from the projects to the water hole
Gucci mama ass bitch used to work at Dominos
Then I laced her now she breakin' niggas for designer clothes

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ladies
I said ladies
Do the ladies run this motherfucker?
Hold on
Fellas
I said fellas
Do the fellas run this motherfucker?
There it is...
