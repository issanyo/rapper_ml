[Intro: MondreMAN]
Yeah, yeah, Joe S what's happening
100s I see you my nigga

[Hook: MondreMAN] (x2)
Smoking on my reefer
It's cloudy I can't see ya
So come a little closer
Come a little closer

[Verse 1: MondreMAN]
[?] in my back pocket, next to my green rag
Green on my nigga, you know how we be rocking
I need a Green Ova shorty that can get it popping
Triple stack of the Molly baby get it popping
On tour, all my niggas [?]
North Carolina got the young hoes bopping
My nigga Tracks Marine said he think he spot 'em
Call me Grabba-Grabba cause you know I got 'em
And we ride and we smoking on doja
This Internet got me bitches and exposure
Backstage hella crowdy, come closer
My nigga brought her here, but now I'm on her
She loves the crew, so baby what it do?
If they fuck with me, then I fuck with you
I'm just trying to get a nut off and a buck or two
Then dip off through the night is what a hustler do

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: 100s]
Throw hands when you're with your niggas
Shots when you're with your kids
So get the lids, 100s is in this bitch taking bids
I just might let her know
Versace with my cousin Mondre, nigga there it go
Young bitch says she's trying to ride me
My dick got a drinking age, let me see your ID
Come a little closer so I can spit it colder
Fuck with the [?] and the Green Ova
Light my shit, never bite my shit
Said her jaw's getting locked up
So the drip she coughed up
Game recognize me, ice cold term, ho
Underweight nigga with the ice cold perm, ho
Let a nigga breathe man, give me about five minutes
No True Hollywood stay up out of my business

[Bridge: MondreMAN]
Hit me on the beeper
Then I might come and see ya

[Hook] (x2)
