Finally The Rock came back and everyone was getting with it
'Til he said I was talking trash, but he would never be specific
It's because I wasn't talking trash Rock, I was talking truth
You left us hanging high and dry to play a fairy with a tooth?
And then you walk into this ring and tell these people that I'm lame man?
He wore lipstick in Get Shorty and rocked a skirt for The Game Plan
This 'Fruitty Pebble' that you're dealing with;
I'm not your average jabroni
I'm like a big purple pinwheel Rock, so go ahead and blow me
And you're electrifying, yes, but hang with me that's just absurd
See now you got to tell your family you just got schooled by Barney's turd
Wait wait wait wait
That's your material
You can have your joke back
Just don't go racing to Witch Mountain Rock
Because your mountain is Brokeback
The Rock's new movie?
Well it's nothing like Walking Tall
He spends the movie in a bowling alley polishing my balls
The "People's Champ"? He's never with the people
Rock, your words are see-trough
You imitate me every time you leave; for 7 years we couldn't see you
And is it Rock or is it Dwayne?
Pick a side, come on son
If I was you, I'd stick with Rock because Dwayne ain't got a johnson
And you'll see me at WrestleMania?
Well then I'll make sure not to miss it
But you ain't going to whip my candy ass dude I'll make sure you kiss it
You're the WrestleMania host Rock, that's your role, know it
You tell these people that you love them
I'm here every week to show it
That's called a first round knock out
And now you know that I'm not playing
Run your mouth all you want dude
It doesn't matter what you're saying
