[Chorus]
Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
Its the franchise, Boy, I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now
[VERSE 1]
In case you forgot, or fell off
I'm still hot. Knock your shell off
My money stack fat, plus I can't turn the swell off
The franchise doing big business
I live this
Is automatic I win this
So you hear those horns who finish
A soldier and I stay under you fighting
Cause I'm stormin' on you chumps like thunder and lightning
Ain't no way you breaking me kid, I'm harder than nails
Plus I keep it on lock like I'm part of the jail
I'm slaughtering stale competition
I got the whole block wishing they could run with my division
But, they gone fishing with no bait
Can't your boy hold weight?
I got my soul straight
I'll brush your mouth like Colgate
In any weather I'm ever better your boy so hot
You'll never catch me in the next man's sweater
If they hate, let 'em hate, I'll drop their whole clan
Lay your ass down for the three second tan
