"So... you think you're untouchable?"

[Verse One: John Cena]
Whether fightin, or spittin, my discipline is unforgiven
Got you backin up, in a defensive position
An ass-kickin anthem, heavyweight or bantam
Holdin camps for ransom, the microphone phantom
Teams hit the floor, this the new fight joint
Like a broken needle kid, you missin the point!
We dominate your conference with offense that's no nonsense
My theme song hits, get your reinforcements!
We strike quick with hard kicks, duckin night sticks
Bare-knuckle men through fight pits, beat you lifeless
Never survive this! Get forget like Alzheimer's
Two-face rappers, walk away with four shiners
The raw rhymer, turnin legends to old-timers
My incisor's like a viper, bitin through your one-liners!
New Deadman Inc. - and we about to make you famous
Takin over Earth and still kickin' in Uranus!

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Trademarc]
You ain't advanced enough to process potential phonetical concepts
The objects are foreign, like Loch Ness
Sponsored sex, a complex, regardless of your finesse
Or your fitness, it's the condition of business
Your lame vision of a underground, physical image
You're underneath to undermine your whole, typical image
With the precision of percentages, and the collision of sedatives
Poetry, beats, and mics - we untouchable
Like righteous sluts with no crevices
Streets unite, we rock right over dumber beats
Yo' cats couldn't come this hot if they {jerked off} in the summer heat
Forget two takes, kill y'all birds the first time
Yo' best {shit} ain't, worthy of my filler or worst rhymes
I'm better than nice, check the veteran stripes
Leave you beside yourself with fear, I kill you, and bury you twice
Despite the cover of night, trackin your flight
Like guerilla warfare, where the grass is dense
Approachin me is a quick way to get referred to in the past tense
Dead that! When the light to mic is on
The crowd is dead like the intermission when you on the Titantron

[Hook]
