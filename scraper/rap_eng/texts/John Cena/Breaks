[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They try to make me slow down, but I live with the brakes off
They tell me I should hold up, but I live with the brakes off
Brakes off, brakes off, brakes off
And we're going up, up, up, up
Brakes off, brakes off

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
First place in the race
Either first or you're last, my foot stays on the gas
Floatin', ain't take much from out the class
Open the Forbes see a young nigga 'bout his
Hear people talking 'bout their dreams, he really living out his
They hating just to hate, but they don't really doubt it
My eyes stay on the prize
Told EI realised that love built this
So I'll be damned if you be fake, kill it
Put my all in, make 'em feel it
Show me them people who think it's bosses
I'll make them look like children
Top floor of the building, ordering drinks, rolling up
Planes all in the same, goes without saying
Y'all know the slang, no pain, no gain, let's get it

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: John Cena]
I'm making ground mine, you taking downtime
Every word is "hustle", the whole entire sound shine
Chasing the finer things, shining like diamond rings
Gemstone flow, that's the clarity my rhyming brings
King with the cold voice, I'm such a rogue choice
Tailored suit, pulling up in that Rolls Royce
Drop-head coupe, suicide doors
Arriving like Sinatra, Louis Vuitton floors
I'm talking 'bout my shoes, I'm chalking up your crews
I'mma give away the end, partner y'all about to lose
That's just the way it goes, don't take it to heart B
I say you're just a friend cause my biz is the marquee

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
They try to make me slow down, brakes off, brakes
They tell me I should hold up, brakes off, brakes off
They try to make me slow down, brakes off, brakes off
They tell me I should hold up, brakes off
But I live with the brakes off

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
