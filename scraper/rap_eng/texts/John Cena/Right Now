[Intro: John Cena]
Yeah
You can't help but feel it
Can't help but feel this one
Uh-huh uh yeah

[Verse 1: John Cena]
Excuse me for a minute while I lighten the mood
Just clap with me like the lightning do, yeah
A bit of soul food that you be bitin into
And if you feel me then I'm writin for you, uh-huh
Right now put another coat of wax on the ride
For a minute put the beef and the gats to the side
Cause this track's got a vibe to chill to
Enjoy life for 5 minutes, man it's not gon' kill you
It's okay to be hard and stay true man
But at the end of the day, we all hu-man
This one's for you, the ones that you close to
Show some love, it's what you supposed to
Right now, forget the ends and the Bends
Pop a cold one, man toast it wit'cha real friends
Call your folks, tell 'em you tight now
Cause everything lookin pretty good right now

[Hook]
Love has healed my broken heart
Girl, don't you know that you made me a happy man
Girl, I love you more than you'll ever know
Never in a million years will I give you up, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Tha Trademarc]
Right now baby, we all gon' ride
So place those things on your hips or side
The soul vibe gon' change, give way with fame
But sometimes the moral change or stay the same
Relax baby, right now you here
And sit back baby, with a round of beer
And cheer to those friends who crowded near
For those passed on in spirit they there
It's gon' be what it must, break bread wit'cha crew
If you got kids take the crust
It's all love baby, tell your girl she's strong
And whisper in her ear after dinner it's on
And take it slow baby, cause everything real
When you at family dinner y'all enjoy that meal
Thank God that you healthy and you keepin it tight
And keep your dreams lighthearted when you sleepin at night

[Hook]
Love has healed my broken heart
Girl, don't you know that you made me a happy man
Girl, I love you more than you'll ever know
Never in a million years will I give you up, oh yeah

[Verse 3: John Cena]
Yeah - and right now I'm showin love to my brothers and my old man
To my girl, "Let's Get it On" like the slow jam
To everybody that I'm runnin down the road with
Y'all my family, I know that you know this
Fox, Rock, B's and Chaos
Y'all growin up with me man, true to life players
Grandma or grandpa watchin up above
Trademarc you my heart cousin, nothin but love

[Verse 4: Tha Trademarc]
Thanks momma, for all that you was
You a strongarm lady baby crazy with love
My sis done raised me, those are the facts
And taught me how to rebuild when the order collapsed
And right now I'm blessed no stress no less
And thanks hip-hop for givin me back focus, huh
Yeah John, what can I say?
It's all love from day one, you showed me the way

[Hook]
Love has healed my broken heart
Girl, don't you know that you made me a happy man
Girl, I love you more than you'll ever know
Never in a million years will I give you up, oh yeah
