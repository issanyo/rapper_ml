[Verse 1:]
Yo, I asked hip hop for a simple MC
They said they'd send me 2; Fabolous and Jay-Z
But these gangsters didn't wanna come up and be on TV
I'ma tell all of y'all why they wouldn't battle with me
[As Jay-Z:]
Yo man, it's Jay-Z man
I'm fully focused, Rocafella man
I've got my girlfriend man
I don't need to come to Seattle, I'm the king of New York
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Rocafella
[As John Cena:]
Okay then Bonnie, where the hell is Clyde at?
He ducked me like a bitch for a little battle rap
What you want me to do man, call out your fianc√©?
I'd have better competition battle rapping with Beyonce
He's the king of New York, I'm a kid from the cellar
Only way he stays hard is by rocking another fella
Sorry that I didn't have that much time to diss you
I'm focused on Fabolous, he's my real issue

[Verse 2:]
Dude, you need to stick to doing Reebok commercials
He showed up and tapped out after hearing me in rehearsal
They didn't arrest you for your guns, it's because your raps suck
Cops charged him with illegally possessing two nuts
Trade your throwback shirts for a skirt, you little whiner
And hike up your skirt, I can see your man-gina
You wanna black ball me? Well at least I got a ballsack
If they lived at the sperm bank, they couldn't get their cum back
They talk about their ice, and all the girls loving you
The only Bush he's seen is by watching George W
I'm a main event player, these fools is in the background
I take over you, and then I take over Smackdown
They could do a show in their living room and still not sell out
This is the WWE, get the F out
Yo, it's John Cena
Thuganomics hot as hell
He's just a bad idea, like the XFL
I main event Wrestlemania 20
You see me, you out of luck
You don't like what I'm saying?
Well I just don't give a
