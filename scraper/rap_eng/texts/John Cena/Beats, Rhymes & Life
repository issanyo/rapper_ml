Yeah
I hear y'all talkng
I ain't listening fuck that
This shit is real yal are a bunch of bullshit
Wanna question on my shit?
Listen up motherfuckers
I've been real since day one

[Verse 1: John Cena]
They say i can't flow i been knowing my fight
I was born in the evening but it wasn't last night
This is real baby y'all are feeling my heart
I knew my place in the game and i ain't fearing my part
From the start i was climbing uphill
Instead of writing my verse I should be writing a will
I ain't deaf i know what the industry say
Is Cena gonna make it on the mic no way
He's a gimmick just a flash in the pan, fuck that
I keep spittin' till im crashing your plan
And I thank a higher power for my passionate fans
And I'm taking this flight i don't care where it lands
I made a this record with no dealer advance
Thats me giving back to the movement that gave me my chance
You wanna question if I'm real when I drop
Cut me open motherfuckers I be bleeding hip hop

[Hook: John Cena & The Trademarc]
Beats, Rhymes and Life a pad and a pen
You bout to realize I'm a man among men
You having trouble trying to figure it out
Listen up you'll understand what im talking about
X2

[Verse 2: Trademarc]
Yeah I see trough the game a pitching y'all names
Keeping yal at arms length, all you cats are the same
Faded pictures in a pocket frame
Kinda strange man the burden i claim
To bird fame, but i never change i memorize my stride
Separated all my ego from pride
Been a mission of mine
Been the steadiest climb
All odds to find
Man i lost my mind
Man as hard as I tired
I couldn't find a minutes peace it was simply denied
Pressure applied, Im stepping inside a world of negative vibes
Daily grind drawn in hazy lines
Black and white not a craze to find
But i could find
I write rhymes trough divine intervention, at times
My philosophical view is in conflict with you
Cuz everything you living is negative too
Thats my new interpretation to you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: John Cena]
They think I'm just a wrestler, I ain't a Nabisco please
They think that John Cena, just a cracker with cheese
Who the fuck he think he is trying to rhyme
I keep my watch a little fast I'm ahead of my time
While you cats be disecting my production and lines
Just keep the thought in your minds that I still ain't hit my prime
I go from little rich kid to straight covered in grime
From classy to ashy now I'm reaching for shine
Everybody gotta struggle I've been speaking on mine
Three-hundred and sixty five i put my life on the line
Cena's a baller
You think im living fine?
I spend my money on beats and getting studio time
Y'all rap to get a deal, trying to make a mill'
I rap because i feel not who's the one who's real
Run your mouth all you want im deff i can't hear ya
You wanna check somebody? look in the fucking mirror

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Trademarc]
I see the flaw in the fabrics, speak raw
Real shit that i saw
I see the picture but its full of static
Movin on man keeping it strong
My thought patterns are erratic but i know they're not wrong
Its automatic, its the same old song
Cats haven't been around tellin me they been down all along
Its no mystery man, I see the inconsistency in your plans
I got some shine now you handing me ?
You ain't a friend you a foe and a fan
Now you claiming i can trust you, tsh man the fuck I can
You just stab me in the back as I extend my hand
Were the hell were all of you when i was washing pots and pans
Understand?, its all defficient and my decision
Cutiing you off cause having you around is low cost efficient
Man admit it, we not friends im the cat you keep around cuz it pays dividends

[Hook]
