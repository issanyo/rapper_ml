[John Cena]
This is YJ Stinger, man, it's legendary
With nothin' but hot flavaz like Enraged Raspberry
You need a boost? Well, Stinger is necessary
Keeps me focused to access vocabulary
YJ Stinger helps me keep up the pace
And it goes down smooth, it don't got the metal taste
But Stinger hits hard like linebackers do
And it's bought to you by Stacker 2
Them other wannabes, yo, we make 'em extinct
YJ Stinger is your energy drink
This ain't half-assed, we come at ya full swing
So go, "Catch the buzz, feel the sting!"
What?
