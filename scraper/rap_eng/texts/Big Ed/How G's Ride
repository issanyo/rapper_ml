[Master P talking]

Ugh
Niggas be trying to figure out how we roll out here in Cali
You know what I'm saying
Richmond California
My little partners be rolling like Silkk fool

Verse 1 [Master P]

6 deep hittin switches, thats how us G's ride
Candy paint with them gold daytons side to side
Niggas straight fucking bumpin
Niggas trippin, think I'm from Compton
I'm from that southside of Richmond where that hang ya
Put you in a motherfucking 6 inch slanger
Lay you down, drop you to your knees, you want some chesse
Break me off some ends before I make  your ass bleed
]From your nose to your mouth up and outtie
Niggas talking shit cause Master P is gettin rowdy
Got the southside, hoop ride throwin' a 40
Niggas gangbangin like they straight retarded
Throwin up signs, Niggas in line
Bitches hollerin' hoo-ride, Niggas steady dying
I'm from the southside 23rd street
And my little homie Tony from the hills, may he rest in peace
No longer with the crew or the click
But to the niggas that did this shit, we gonna go thick click
And get them thangs and hang ya
Fuckin' round, keep 1 up in the chamber
Richmond niggas don't play cuz we ballin'
And I got this thang sowed up from New Orleans
Coming like a southside gator
And when we roll on your spot, beware of the tru terminators

Chorus (Master P) :

6 deep is how us G's ride
Candy paint gold daytons hittin' switches from side to side
6 deep is how us G's ride
Candy paint gold daytons hittin' switches from side to side

Verse 2 [Silkk The Shocker ]

Well it's Friday, I'm sideways about the highway
Bitchs doing it my way, got 2 for 5, everyday all day
Cuz I gots to get paid, gets mine in the 9, thats why I stay strapped
Everyday I gots to put it down, it be like that
I have a pocket full of stones, I gots like clock now
It was kinda hot outside so I had to puts the top down
I be like breezin' threw the East Bay
R-I-C-H-M-0-N to the C-A, that's where I still be at each day

Chorus:

6 deep is how us G's ride
Candy paint gold daytons hittin switches from side to side
6 deep is how us G's ride
Candy paint gold daytons hittin switches from side to side

Verse 3: [Big Ed]

Big Ed be puttin' it down like that, made more ass than the Hilton
On my way to this hoe's house, bang that ass until its tiltin'
Now I'm rollin', holdin' onto a fat nickel plated 9
I blasted at him who trying to take mine so forget the 1 time
So when a brother rolls up, hold up
Don't make me plug your trick ass like a donut
See Big Ed's about that mint green
Got them hoes' fiending for this dick, like it was laced with nicotine
Killa pussy got 'em slippin up in the hood
Them Green Berets up in Richmond, I know they up to no good
Tried to jet me on that down low
I have more niggas shootin's up your set then the feds did at Waco
Player haters could never stop me
Cuz I'm a No Limit Nigga and got more Crew then Motley
So if you ever try to play me like a hoe
I'm hanging up out the door, with the 44, nigga drive slow

Chorus:

6 deep is how us G's ride
Candy paint gold daytons hittin switches from side to side
6 deep is how us G's ride
Candy paint gold daytons hittin switches from side to side

[Master P talking]

And we up and outtie, it looks cloudy
Cuz yall niggas spinning daytons
(No Limit niggas) on your motherfuckers turf
(Soldier For Life, No Limit 4-Life)
And for all yall niggas that done sold out
We be keeping it real
Independent, black owned
Running our own shit
We drop shit anytime we want to, anytime we ready
How many yall niggas can say that?
I just might drop something tomorrow
