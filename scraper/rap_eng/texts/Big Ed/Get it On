[Fiend]
Whomp! Whomp!

Direct to all surviours on the battlefield
Let's hustle up, get blunted up and test you, what the fuck?
Muscle Up, it's very crazy, for all the killings
Humble up, they don't expect like raw dealings, come winter
Bundle up, me and my pistols stay cuddled up
Gone, nigga, Jones nigga, Sleepy Eye from that zone nigga
Boy they bringing lots of guns, check my home and picture
Besides from every crick that's gone split ya
Memphis I'm hypotinzed with it, means some eyes with it
Voice so high with it, 2005 with it
So ride with it or be rolled the fuck over
Fiend's surviving the soldier, grenade thrower

Chorus [Big Ed] (Fiend)

I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to getbuck
I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck
I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck
I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck

[Big Ed]
Niggas about to get fucked up
I guess you niggas don't know that I can bucked up
I'm quick to pull the gats, let 'em go, bust bust bust
Stampede on your ass when your fucking with us
I gain the strength of ten men all angeled up
PCP,  scared one droppin' big tank trucks
I'm pumpin' iron at the wake, getting all swolled up
Rip off my shirt, at concerts, 'cause I'm tatted up
Never worrying about them bustas, my niggas gatted up
Don't step to us, my niggas quick to tear shit up
We lock in down in every town 'cause we got it solded up
In the hood it's all good, 'cause they rolling with us
Doing shows at clubs 'cause I don't give a fuck
You can find me in that bitch fucking booted up
Bust a nigga in his head if he tries to run up
4 is 1, 8 is 0, bitch I stay one up

Chorus [Big Ed] (Fiend)

I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to getbuck
I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck
I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck
I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck

[Fiend]
Come on and let the bigger nigga through
Don't look for just a teardrop, 'cause him a killer too
South gonna make a crew, 'cause you a bitch
I'm callin' your ass, wanna lose my (??)
No such thing as missing business
Your family have to cop a pay to visti
Let 'em both say I did it
And watch how quick they lie on stage, get it?

[Big Ed]
I don't give a -

Get that motherfucker, (Where he at?), Right there
Nigga I'm bringing drama anytime anywhere
Niggas scrapling in the club, but I don't care
I keep my gat in the club, and bust like a flare
See I don't give a fuck (FUCK), we don't give a fuck (FUCK)
Bitch I'm bout it, bout it, about to get fucked up

Chorus [Big Ed] (Fiend)

I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to getbuck
I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck
I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck
I don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck (We can get it on)
We don't give a fuck, we 'bout to get buck
