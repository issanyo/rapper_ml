Fuck
Sometimes I just wish I could sleep it off
Cause i dream about things that I know that i can't have
Thing i know will never happen
Like a safe enviroment money happiness sucess
Niggas want static than he going to get it
I came up with blood money that means
I'm wicked I roll with nothing but ninos
So they call me a baller i wiped a niggas ass
Because I'm not a talker
Took a flight to kali came back with some birds
Ten g's for a key from a nigga called dirt
I like to hear my mack eleven empty out a clip
Shot a fool up in the club and then i changed my outfit
Maintain and uphold my statis as a g
Niggas kiss my ass because i got alot of money
Plain and simple niggas leave huh when i don't feel'em
Because they know when they fuck up then i'm going to kill'em
Understand i was rasied where the young niggas roam
If you wanted something nigga you had to get up on your own
All these want to be motherfucken
Ass hustlers better wake up and stop killing on another
Cause

Chorus 2x
I wish that life was a dream
Cause some times i wake up
And just want to scream
I live amounst the cut throats and the killers
Lord don't let my son be another victim
