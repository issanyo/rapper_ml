[Big Ed]
Most fools be tripping swaring that they got your back
But so so funk sure they running faster then Flo Jo
Like a hoe and now his boy is like hung out, strung out
Shots rang out, the jackers left him laid out
Now you decide to come back after them fools leave
Scream your boys name, tugging on his buddies sleeve

[Silkk]
Couldn't understand it, took it for granted
Left for gone when he panicked
You can hear his mom cry as his body hit the canvas
A six tre rolled up with the lights dim
Then he broke, in his voice bullet meant for him
Suckers be bouncin' when the funk flow
But if you rolling with me there's one thing that I gots to know

Chorus 2X

Would you take a bullet for your homie
I got trust up in myself cause most these fools are living phony

[Big Ed]
The B-I-G E-D is going out like a G
And my partners behind the triggers are on the side of me
So if it falls out, brothers I'm going all out
So tell my mom I love her if the game takes me out
Cause I'm real for the TRU
My love is running deep for the family I would die for you
Big Ed is scared of dying yo that's sort of true
But I would rather die then to let somebody kill you
Cause I know my nina be singing busting caps on nizzide
Tizzide, homocide on them bustas
Be the only thing that will make me feel all right
I'm down to go I know these suckas are aiming for my chest
Be aware of my Smith and his partner Wes
But if I'm gone G I guess I have to go G
Just pour some liquor on the curb and remember me
The B-I-G E-D, the real O.G
The ace that laid down and took a bullet for his homie

Chorus 3X

[Silkk]
Would you take a bullet now let's just face the facts
There may be consiquences, uh, and you may not be coming back
So before all that on the line think about them times
And if the bullet was for me would you take mine
And for my homies, we drank, threw up, grew up and played together
We goin' die, we goin' get shot but we goin' stay together
A pint of gin as I reminisce on my ace deuce
A real G that laid it all down for his crew
I could still see it just as plain as day
Lying in the street before we die that what he said
Told me to stay strong and give his mom a kiss
RIP, definately goin' be missed
So for all my homies I did dirt and put in work
I'll take a bullet for you homie even though it'll hurt

Chorus 2X

[Big Ed]
Silkk would you die for me, i'd die for you fool
Lay it all down for the T-R-U crew
That's how it's gonna be

[Silkk]
No that's how it's gotta be
I got love for my folks because my folks got love for me
A G, see, the youngest in the crew
Tatoo across my stomach got T-R-U
When I'm rollin' up on them B's with my G's I'm never tripping

[Big Ed]
Big Ed is on your side with that nine

[Silkk]
And the pippen

[Big Ed]
The kamakaze, these suckers really don't know me, the O.G
Rolling with King George, Cally G, and Master P
And uh, C-Murder, Silkk, the real untouchables
Down to die for all but much quicker to bust a hoe
Now you know that's for show are you a real G

[Silkk]
You say you a kill but would you take a bullet for your homie

Chorus 2X

[Master P]
Yeah yeah fool check this out though
The game ain't even the same anymore man
The game gettin' thick you know what i'm sayin' nigga
Its gettin' to thick that means it time to get out
You know what i'm sayin', it ain't even cool though partner
I gotta say RIP to Kevin Miller my little brother man
I'm gonna see you in the cross-fire fool
Plan B, Gangsta Earl, my little partner Vernell
Y'all goin' be missed though man
This defenately for all you players out there you know what I'm sayin'
I know y'all out there rollin' one of those big fat ass phillies
You know what I'm sayin'
Getin' high, rollin' with your partners
You could be rollin' with a bitch you know what I'm sayin'
You should look that motherfucker in the eye you know what I'm sayin'
Ask that motherfucker is he down for you, is he TRU to the game
In other words, would he take one of them 44's you know what I'm sayin'
One of them Mack 10's, one of them Tre 8's or somethin' like that
You know, is he willing to die for the cause
