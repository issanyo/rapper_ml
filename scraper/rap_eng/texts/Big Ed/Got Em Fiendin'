Intro:
A little something something. Lights, camera, action

Hook:
One for the G's two to make them jump
Three for the hoes tha be fiedin' for this ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto fuk (x2)

Master P:
Alize whipped up cranked up ouee
Got two freaks in the jacuzze
Wanna do me, me and my homie
I ain't trippin' on a motherfuckin' roni
Hit the club start bumpin' jumpin'
Gat in my drawers and a nigga still humpin'
On this hoe but the bitch can't fee the gat
TRU niggas and you know we fully strapped
Hit the nigga talk shit put they light out
Otherwords X niggas out like whiteout
Roll through the town mob with my niggas deep
Don't give a fuck about those hoes or the police
Got a bee pe on my way to the telly
Stop and get some lobster and steak to feel the belly
Hit the liquor store gots to pick up some gin & juice
Cause you know I got to have my 80 proof
Dank smoke comin' out the windows
Hit the side show bust a nigga in a Pinto
Ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party (what?)
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party

Hook (x2)

Silkk The Shocker:
Hotel motel Holiday Inn
I'm about to fuck me a girl but I'm gonna fuck her friend
Now you know um what you came to do
I be TRU baby don't believe the hype
You know it ain't about me and you
Now if you down with O.P.P. yeah you know me
It ain't no fun if my homies can't have none
Now we share skirt like air frankly  I don't care
I hits and run and then I'm up outta there
Now um, baby lately you can't get with me
If (we don't love them hoes) it'all all about my business
Now I really do't care what you like and what you don't
Cause um, The only think I'm trying to is get you drunk
Now I'm a diver but I don't skinny dip, now picture this
A skinny nigga between the hips and I'm about to dip
Off in the traffic smilin' and laughin'
I met that I had that we did that I done that

Hook

Big Ed:
Bouncin' to the party I just got payed
I'm looking for th finest hoe so I can get layed
I done see more ass than any gynocologist
Smooth like a prism
Got my B and my masters in this playerism
No more then 5 minutes, a chocolate bunny
Now I though she was a fiend cause she wants to suck my dick with honey
Well baby let's discuss this
My name is Big Ed and a nigga get more dick then buckets
See I'm flowin' got more pipe than any plummer
I hit 'em like a monsoon cause a nigga hits like thunder
And I got one creamin' like a Twinkie
I'm a bad man ask a girl and her best friend
I like to bend them
Then I slide on in so if you down with foreplay give me a signal
See I'm true to the game
I hit you sister your mama and your daughter to me it's the same
