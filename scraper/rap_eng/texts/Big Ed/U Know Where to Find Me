(*talking*)
The trunk on these bitches brah, come on Verc'
Pass me that chopper nigga

[Intro]
Let's take it to the trunk, motherfuck them niggas
Let's take it to the trunk, gun play nigga
Let's take it to the trunk, all day nigga
Let's take it to the trunk, yeeeah nigga

[Big Ed]
I get tried, of these motherfucking niggas talking shit
I guess they think they bad, cause they hanging with they click
But they don't know I'll click, and kill they whole click
I take it to the trunk, and let the rounds spit
See I don't give a fuck, I never gave a fuck
You get your ass shot, bout to burn this nigga up
I'm on the dance flo', push and shoving with the thugs
Got a drink in my hand, acting rowdy in the club
That's my nigga Vercy 9, Big Poke is stacked
Rowdy got my back, Po' and Ro got the gats
Special Forces Ops, bout it as the fuck
And if y'all niggas doubt it, then y'all niggas run up
Oh you think you tough, well I'ma call your bluff
Keep his ass by the bar, bitch you can't fuck with us
Hit that bitch with a bottle, got his ass throttled
Thrown out by security, fuck we back tomorrow

[Hook]
So you gonna get your boys, (you know where to find me)
So you gonna get your toys, (you know where to find me)
I heard you niggas got beef, (you know where to find me)
You wanna take it to the streets, (you know where to find me)
So you wanna go to war, (you know where to find me)
Nigga who you looking for, (you know where to find me)
You got my name in your mouth, (you know where to find me)
You wanna see what I'm about (you know where to find me)

[Big Ed]
I'm from a little city, Richmond California
Day time or night time, niggas'll run up on you
Hoes shaking ass, but they bout that cash
And they will jack you for your Visa, keep your 4-5 on the dash
Flossing at the lake, drop top Mustang
Daytons and vogues, old school doing big thangs
Seen this hoe named Tracy, man this broad hates me
All because I'm fucking her friend, and ain't fucked her lately
Now she's talking shit, spit on my car and shit
I ain't gon take this shit, I'm bout to rough her up and shit
Then I thought quick, fuck I ain't gon do that
Got two guns in my car, and in the car got a fat sack
Police will hang my ass, five years mandatory
So I just listened to this bitch, tell her story
Her brother's gonna do this, her cousin's gonna do that
Well fuck I ain't hard to find, you know where I be at

[Hook]
