[Intro: Silkk the Shocker]
A little something, something, haha
Lights, camera, action

[Chorus: Silkk the Shocker]
One for the G's, two to make them jump
Three for the hoes that be fiedin' for this ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
One for the G's, two to make them jump
Three for the hoes that be fiedin' for this ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk

[Verse 1: Master P]
Alize whipped up cranked up, ooh-wee
Got two freaks in the jacuzzi
Wanna do me, me and my homie
I ain't trippin' on a motherfuckin' roni
Hit the club start bumpin', jumpin'
Gat in my drawers and a nigga still humpin'
On this ho but the bitch can't fee the gat
TRU niggas and you know we fully strapped
'Case a nigga talk shit, put they light out
Otherwords X niggas out like whiteout
Roll through the town mob with my niggas deep
Don't give a fuck about those hoes or the police
Got a beep on my way to the telly
Stop and get some lobster and steak to feel the belly
Hit the liquor store, gots to pick up some gin and juice
'Cause you know I got to have my 80 proof
Dank smoke comin' out the windows
Hit the sideshow bust a nigga in a Pinto
Ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party (What?)
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

[Chorus: Silkk the Shocker]
One for the G's, two to make them jump
Three for the hoes that be fiedin' for this ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
One for the G's, two to make them jump
Three for the hoes that be fiedin' for this ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk

[Verse 2: Silkk the Shocker]
Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
I'm about to fuck me a girl but I'ma fuck her friend
Now you know um what you came to do
I be TRU, baby, don't believe the hype
You know it ain't about me and you
Now if you down with O.P.P.,yeah, you know me
It ain't no fun if my homies can't have none
Now we share skirt like ai,r frankly I don't care
I hits and run and then I'm up outta there
Now um, baby, lately you can't get with me
If (We don't love them hoes) it's all about my business
Now I really don't care what you like and what you don't
'Cause um, the only thing I'm tryna do is get you drunk
Now I'm a diver but I don't skinny dip, now picture this
A skinny nigga between the hips and I'm about to dip
Off in the traffic smilin' and laughin'
I met that, I had that,we did that, I done that

[Chorus: Silkk the Shocker]
One for the G's, two to make them jump
Three for the hoes that be fiedin' for this ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk

[Verse 3: Big Ed]
Bouncin' to the party I just got payed
I'm lookin' for the finest ho so I can get layed
I done see more ass than any gynecologist
Smooth like a prism, got my B and my masters in this playerism
No more than 5 minutes, a chocolate bunny
Now I thought she was a fiend 'cause she wants to suck my dick with honey
Well baby, let's discuss this
My name is Big Ed and a nigga get more dick then buckets
See I'm flowin', got more pipe than any plumber
I hit 'em like a monsoon 'cause a nigga hits like thunder
And I got one creamin' like a Twinkie
I'm a bad man, ask a girl and her best friend
I like to bend them, and then I slide on in
So if you down with foreplay give me a signal
See I'm true to the game
I hit your sister, your mama and your daughter, to me it's the same

[Chorus: Silkk the Shocker]
One for the G's, two to make them jump
Three for the hoes that be fiedin' for this ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
One for the G's, two to make them jump
Three for the hoes that be fiedin' for this ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
Got 'em fiendin' for the ghetto funk
