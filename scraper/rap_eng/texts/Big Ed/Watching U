[Big Ed]
Now we been friends for a very long time (True)
I'm trying to figure out how to make you mine
Candle light, soft music, sippin' wine
Your esscence got me like my, my, my
Your man is watching so we ain't got much time
But I had to let you know what's on my mind
Backrubs sending chills up your spine
Tonight me and you in horizontal lines (Stop that!)
Deep strokes with my fingers at your twine
Can you picture it baby close your eyes
Slide my hands up your caramel thighs
The way we dancing baby got me hypnotize
He ain't right for you that snake in disguise
All he ever does is cheat and tell lies (I know that)
I wanna evaluate your mind and fantasize
Come spend a night with me and watch the sunrise
(I can't do that)

Chorus [Odel]

I been watching you, diggin' me
But I can't help but notice girl your with someone else
If I holla don't be mad at me
See I mean no disrespect, but I want you for myself
When I leave, who will you come with tonight?

[Big Ed]
Now look at your boy now he's mean staring
Try to mean mug like I'm really caring (I gotta go!)
I'ma hog you to myself cause I ain't sharing
A life full of Ectasy is what I'm preparing
I know I'm straight forward kinda overbarring
I want you as my queen is what I'm declaring
And if he acts up then I'm warfaring
Freddy Krueger style straight nightmarin' (Alright now!)
Him and me, is really no comparing
He's old, while I'm young, handsome and daring
I'll drape you in the finest wearin'
Cause I'm kinda like millionarin' (Stop stuntin')
I'll keep you cummin', shakin, swearin'
Having fun with edible underwearin' (I like that!)
Think about while the systems blarin'
Get me back to me, thanks for the dance Sharon (Fa sho')

[Odel]
Me for you and you for me
We is the way it should be
I wonder if I ran a good game
I'm hoping while the song is playin'
You would come to me, in the future we will see
And if you leave it up to me,  me is where you'll be

Chorus [Odel]

I been watching you, diggin' me
But I can't help but notice girl your with someone else
If I holla don't be mad at me
See I mean no disrespect, but I want you for myself
When you leave who will you come with tonight?
Watching you, diggin' me
But I can't help but notice girl your with someone else
If I holla don't be mad at me
See I mean no disrespect, but I want you for myself
When I leave, who will you come with tonight?
