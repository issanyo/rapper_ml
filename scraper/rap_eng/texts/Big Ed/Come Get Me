We can tear this bitch up, how you won't do it
How you won't bring it, nigga step to me
We can tear this bitch up, how you won't do it
How you won't bring, nigga step to me
We can tear this bitch up, how u won't do it
How you won't bring it, nigga step to me now, what
How u won't do it

Verse 1: Big Ed

I'm from a little city called Wes town
Roll quick to blast and known to buck 'em down
You get killed if ya' from outta town
Where after dark it ain't safe to hang around
I hang with nothing but No Limit soldiers
We pull our straps and knock ya' head off ya' shoulders
Never ever gave a fuck about the rollers
Cause all my niggas getting high smoking doulja
You can find us in the club getting rowdy
Move ya' ass if ya ain't bout it bout it
You can come and run up if ya doubt it
But if ya real let me hear my niggas shout it

Chorus: repeat 4x

If ya want me, nigga come and get me (COME AND GET ME)
Cause I gotta gang of guns and my niggas with me
(AND MY NIGGAS WITH ME)

Verse 2:

I went I'll put 'em in my car
Hold spot like I'm a superstar
The tank list you know who we are
Met a group of ho's sitting at the bar
Boy want 'cha know she come home with me
I see her man and he's looking angry
I know ya nigga, yo ya girl choose me
Don't make the scene in here get ugly
But the nigga kept on talking so I stuck 'em
And yo we nine a went outside so you can buck 'em
And sho a nuff me and my niggas let 'em have it
And I still took his lady home and stabbed it

Chorus repeat 4x

If ya want me, nigga come and get me (COME AND GET ME)
Cause I gotta gang of guns and my niggas with me
(AND MY NIGGAS WITH ME)
