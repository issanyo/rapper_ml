Ohh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight, Ohhh

New money
White forces
New money
White porches
Blue money
I like bosses
White frames
His name is Scott Storches
Cold bottles
Hit the forgery
Top models and they're gorgeous
And look here's a pen call me around 10
Ask him I'm the man girlfriend
Shes hot, and i got her
New drops dun done her
Dont stop, more dollars
Twenty on the watch
Who you know do it hotter
I talk it, i live it, i do it the best
She on the right and you on the left
Now move it ya body, now you out of breath
Keep doing what you doing to death
Two step like:

Ohh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight, Ohhh (X2)

I was on krys
She was on e
I was on her, she was on me
In the club drunk seeing off key like (ohhh)

Didn't it feel good to see niggas up on it
Got two coops new
Didn't flaunt it
Old work new stashes
Old work in the plastic
Money first
Thats classic
Ain't a thing at the whip game master
She stops I spot her
Louis top, boots prada
I get it I got it i had it before
Eh making this money is all that I know
And moving ya body get back on the floor
Keep doing what you doing some more
Lets go like:

Ohh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight, Ohhh (X2)

The way you walk the way you move
The way you talk the way you move
On my grind I can't lose
Cuz I am so cool
The way you look, the way you stand
The way you say what you said
I can't help it, its the way I am
Cause I am so cool

Ohh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight, Ohhh (X2)
