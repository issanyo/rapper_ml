[Verse 1: Karde]
(Got my nigga Bre, Smitty)
Niggas ain't fuckin' with the Mafia
Say you finna bust what's stoppin' ya
East side niggas whats poppin' cuh, fuck dick riding niggas just stop it bruh
Came through with Bre in the black truck, think we on a trip how we packin' stuff
Iraq shit like Pakistan, hit 'em in the chest oh that's your man
Not from the Middle East but you said I ran, trynna fuck us up oh that's yo plan
I'm thinking you probaby need a new one
When my thugs pull up ya whole crew run
My mob roll deep you a shook one
Not a game when ya head leakin' Temple Run
Make moves like Wii or a fuckin' Kinect
To get some weed hit my fuckin' connect
Gold all in my bezzle, different color charms Fruity Pebbles
Got ya dream girl in ya dream car, that's a Porsche of course I'm a fuckin' star
Got all the work in the mansion, from CT to LA expansion
Red bottoms look like my foot bloody, turn ya girl out now that bitch slutty
She want want my money, she want this dick
A smile and a wave is all she get
She wanted World Peace back when I first Metta
Looked her in the eyes and said you know better
Karde why you such an asshole, bet she still gave me the ass though
Stop it, my profit, is 2 mill, I'm too trill
You niggas don't got shit, you just get high and pop pills
Shout out to Rihanna, word around town she a bad gyal
Be my baby mama, in the bed we can burn mad cals
Always in some designer clothes, Givenchy, Versace it's mine ya know
Give two fucks about a hater, when my iPhone ring I'll see you later
Just got back from the Caribbean, her Spanish friends and they all tens
Business with pleasure that's a bad mix, that's like a lame nigga with a bad bitch
This street talk, this drug talk.. when my thugs talk, its gonna drop

[Verse 2: Smitty]
It's Bre in this bitch
Stay calm when it come to these fuck niggas
Blow up so quick don't know what hit ya
East coast chillin' yeah that's cool with me
Fine art off the Canon, gold jewelry
Ya flow tight but none of y'all niggas can fool with me
Got my chips all dressed in cheddar
Hit ya girl once beat it up then its see you later
She up in the Bentley screamin' "Bre Bre bend me"
Bank roll so large it'll never go empty
96 to 2013 Chanel clean Pimp C, and premiere still comin'
Bars so cold always got your nose runnin'
It's NIP on MIP in all black
Flights are silence with these two Gs, comin' on top nigga can't you see
Game on lock with my niggas SGT, told you that we won't stop with the luxuries
Bad red thick bitch with the diamonds B
Rap hood, I'm good for ya take your minerals B
Every nigga wanna talk about the bitches they fuck
Ya bread really needa to get to start racking up
Skinny nigga well paid get put on the wave
My heart to the Ricans, fat asses my fave
When the money come you know the girls come too
Tell Dre to let the foreign women come through
Nikes on my feet with the Bape on the tee
She said my style is street, it's hustle time no shit come free
I street talk to your girl with no I.D
This ain't the life I live, the dream you gonna see
We armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed no angel dust
