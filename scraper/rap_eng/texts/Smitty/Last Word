[Hook]
It’s the last verse
And y’all wanna get your cash first
And we came to get the club up
Pullin’ bitches on the stage like ‘what’s up’
Don’t hate, get fucked up

[Verse 1 - D-Learey]
It’s your last hustle - the last shuffle, last scuffle
Your last thug - the last slug, your last drug
Your last year - your worst fear, your last tear
Your last step - the last breath you got left
Sincerely, D-Learey - I spit it clearly
Down the eardrum of any MC near me
Burn your clique severely the second that you hear me
Love, hate, or fear me, you never can compare me

[Hook]
It’s the last verse
And y’all wanna get your cash first
And we came to get the club up
Pullin’ bitches on the stage like ‘what’s up’
Don’t hate, get fucked up
Last verse
And y’all wanna get your cash first
And we came to get the club up
Pullin’ bitches on the stage like ‘what’s up’
Don’t hate, get fucked up

[Verse 2 - Ed O.G.]
It’s the last verse - the last verse, the last curse
I’m the last man - the last gram the last stand
It’s your last fight - your last night, your last rights
The last [?]  - last Black, last Puerto Rican
The last carnivore in a world of vegans
Eddie Ray get treed and beered up
Geared up - come to the club to tear it up
No eyein’ the enemies
The only shots we takin’ is shots of Hennessies
Takin’ bitches to the compound like the Kennedys
Eddie Ray full of energy
D-Learey - my nigga Sunny’s Loco never local
When The Last Words spittin’ vocals

[Hook]
It’s the last verse
And y’all wanna get your cash first
And we came to get the club up
Pullin’ bitches on the stage like ‘what’s up’
Don’t hate, get fucked up
Last verse
And y’all wanna get your cash first
And we came to get the club up
Pullin’ bitches on the stage like ‘what’s up’
Don’t hate, get fucked up

[Verse 3 - Sunny Loco]
And it’s your last try, the last lie - your last tie
Your last shot, the last plot - your last spot
The last play, the last save - the last stay
The last gun, your first son - the last one
The name’s Sunny - ain’t nothin’ funny with fuckin’ with my money
Get your life blurred - one third of the last word
I’m a menace - smack a nigga harder than tennis
Soul blacker than Guinness when it comes to this business
You wanna start?  I’mma finish - kid I own like you rented
Full-blown while you dented - if I said it, then I meant it

[Hook]
It’s the last verse
And y’all wanna get your cash first
And we came to get the club up
Pullin’ bitches on the stage like ‘what’s up’
Don’t hate, get fucked up
Last verse
And y’all wanna get your cash first
And we came to get the club up
Pullin’ bitches on the stage like ‘what’s up’
Don’t hate, get fucked up
