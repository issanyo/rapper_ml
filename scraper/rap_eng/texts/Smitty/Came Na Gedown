[Smitty]
Wa'la, in comes the Smitten nigga be cool grip
Red dots bogus in the fuck the world type shit
Puffing on a blunt, pass the pill I fucking dribble
Kicking mo' shit that's versatile, in my mind you might find Sybil
Click click, ya niggas recognize the sound
Fill 'em up from the south, nigga we came to get down
Where do we go from here?
I don't know but here's my motherfucking Glock to your ear
Now nigga say "mercy"
Or I gotta terminate your posse
Cause on my block Frida, Frida and Fred got a Glock
A simple death is how a motherfucker wish it went
Result in murder ain't no goddamn coincidence

[Rick Royal]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
What's happening, did you bring your AK?
Cause I'm 'bout to get disrespectful like Shanaayna
Where you're home alone tonight it's poltergeist
Oh you wants to shoot me in the pinky toe...that's not nice
Don't you know I'm on some ole' fuck the world type shit?
Giving a nigga the bullet to bite with, ham-burger
Goddamn murder in the water burger
Boy you so crazy, it leaves my brain and lazy

Put your game to my niggas that's pumping that shit on the block
Rolling with some Real Mccoy gangstas on this phat track
Again kicking that gangsta shit to put these niggas on they back
They wondered if I could kick it, motherfuckers I'ma kick this
Like Odd Squad, it's been A Long Time Comin bitch
Dropping a verse and getting them up from the get-go
Fucking 'em up and ripping a patch out your asshole
So I'ma send the fucking shot to make you buckle up
And if you want some motherfucker won't you knuckle up?
It's the C.O.Z.Y.K. in the nine trey
Ninety fo', ninety fever in ya fucking face
A young niggas coming straight from the Oak Town
Joe hooked me up, I came to Texas straight to get down

[Ed Jack]

Charged a crazy motherfucker cause my dick's hard
Making it hard, making it easy cause it difficult
Will I die tomorrow from busting caps I don't know
You had enough I get 'em up cause it's like that
You can't hang with the big balling Ed Jack nigga
Don't pull the trigger, how the fuck you figure?
Fuck around and be the deadest motherfucker in the cemetery
If you know like I know, you won't make a sound nigga

Get down to the hits that's made by the Odd Squad

Going deeper than deep so you better grab your swimwear
And all your business take care

[Scarface]

The rawest motherfucker you ever saw and that's
The Odd Squad, nigga The Odd Squad, nigga The Odd Squad nigga
So suck a nigga's dick and make it bigger

In other words I rips up enough for damages
But I got some little niggas in my hooptie

[Kilo]
So slap that ass back before you get a gold slug in your motherfucker mug
Little Kilo is giving bigger niggas love

[6-4]
They call a nigga violent
But when I'm silent I get pissed
They tried to hold a black back cause I throw up my black fist
Just call me "assassin" while I'm blasting on yo' bitch ass
I'm that sicka nigga, I can dig a ditch fast
And I can lay you six feet deep like the undertaker
Make a sick nigga wanna break a
Motherfucking neck
What did you expect from the lunatic?
Soon it gets deeper than deep
The buck boom will kick fast
Blast blast motherfuckers never stop
Dropping cops till we the last motherfuckers
In the clique, awe shit, what a sight
No motherfucking flashing lights
Fucking with the ounces, mo' bounces

Suckas wanna feel the real but they don't hear me though
Don't die
Why must I act a fucking clown?
Ten deep in the game and I came to get down

[Hook]

[Blind Rob]
I put my left foot in, my left foot out
Now I doing the hokey pokey with this thang in your mouth

And it's the handicap assassin
And I be blasting
And if you don't know you better ask kid
I'm the one who gets down for mine
AKA The Fucking Man and I'll dick you all the time
And you can put that on your granny's panty
Handing out knuckle sandwiches and keeping plenty rubbers handy
My style is simple and plain mayne
None of that skiddily diddily day ah
Or jumping around and playing
Cause I gets blitzed off that Schlitz bitch but peep this
But I still kicks that ill tip, pardon me while I take this quick piss

But it's the O double D, bitch
And we came to get down
