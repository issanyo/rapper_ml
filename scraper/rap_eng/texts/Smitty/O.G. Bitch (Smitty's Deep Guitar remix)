I am the original bitch, I am the original whore
I am the girl that you just won't admit you adore
I am the original witch, I am the original whore
I am the girl that you just won't admit you adore

I suppose you think that you know me now
Yeah, I bet you've got it all figured out
And you try and pick apart the shit that I do
All the while the quest for fame has got you
You're so vein, you don't even notice that corruption surrounds you
You don't even notice somebody set their arms around you

You're just waiting for me to drown
So no one knows that you stole my whole sound
And yet you're grinning when I come around
You fake ass bitch
(2x)

I am the original bitch, I am the original whore
I am the girl that you just won't admit you adore
(I know, I know you love me)
I am the original witch, I am the original whore
I am the girl that you just won't admit you adore

How kind of you to offer what you think a woman should do or say
Maybe if you weren't so self-righteous
You would not have such a hard time getting laid

Whatever you have to say out loud to convince yourself that you're right
Oh it's just too bad you carry no conviction in your so-called revelations
Your pedantic conversations shed no light

Oh you're just waiting for me to drown
So no one knows that you stole my whole sound
And yet you're grinning when I come around
You fake ass bitch
(2x)

I am the original bitch, I am the original whore (yeah, yeah)
I am the girl that you just won't admit you adore
(You know you love me)
I am the original witch (I am), I am the original whore (yeah, yeah)
I am the girl that you just won't admit you adore
