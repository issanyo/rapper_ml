(feat. Robin Thicke)

[Chorus:]
Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It mustve been somethin you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1:]
New money, white forces
New money, white porches
Blue money, liek bosses
White frames aiming Scott Storches
Gold bottles hit the boards(?) wit
Top models and their gorgeous
Look, heres a pen
Call me round 10
Ask him, i'm the man girlfriend
Shes hot, and i got her
No trot, dun dot 'er
Dont stop, mo' dollars
20 on the watch
Who you know do it holler
I talk it
I live it
I do it the best
She on the right, and you on the left
Movin yo body til you outta breath
Keep doin what you doin to def
2 step liek

[Chorus: x2]
Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It mustve been somethin you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2:]
I was on cris
She was on E
I was her, she was on me
In the club drunk singin off key liek
"oh oh oh oh"
Damn it feel good to see niggas up on it
Got 2 coupes new
Didn't flaunt it
Old work, new stashes
Old work, in the plastic
Money first, thats classic
Ain't a thang, got the whip game masta'd
She stops
I spot her
Blue top
Boots prada
I get it
I got it
I had her before
Makin this money is all that I know
Movin yo body get back on the floo
Keep doin what you doin somemo
Lets go liek oh

[Chorus: x2]
Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been somethin you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3:]
The way you walk, the way you move
The way you talk, the way you move
On my grind I can't lose
Cause I am so cool
The way you look, the way you stand
The way you said what you said
Can't help it its the way I am
Cause I am so cool

[Chorus: x2]
Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been somethin you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh
