I strong arm with lyrics, watch how I prove myself
Whether shadow-boxing or full contact I maneuver well
About to have rap locked, with rhymes two to a cell
Inmate in segregated housing unit refusing the mail
Nervous, chain smoker, high blood pressure
I mastered food or court jester, lyrical sport experts
Dress for tennis, the mind of Minota with special-effect lenses
Parade of all stars, with Brownsville bullet gold cards
Done played with a full deck, as positive as my drug urine test
My rhymes do to your brain what bullets do ta flesh!
Rockin the house, the cradle, the boat, in the eighth grade
Coulda rocked the bells, but I was more comfortable in straight legs
Strong, like the contribution to rap Kane gave
My ego and my conscience refuse to share the same space
Treacherous like Naughty By Nature and Kool Moe Dee
Wouldn't catch me Half Steppin', even if I lost both feet
