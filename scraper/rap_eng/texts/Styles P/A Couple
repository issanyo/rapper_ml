[Intro: Styles P]
Lighting up that shit, you know?
Let's go Bern, money time

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Plant it, grow it and then bag it up
Put it out on the dealer, roll it and hash it up
Six digits on the machine, nigga
Came from a dirty ass hood but I'ma clean nigga
Had to sell dope to get soap and some extra groceries
Outta my home, on my own, niggas know it's me
I learned life had it's ups and downs
Had to show them fuck boys I ain't fuck around
I took the hood like they gave it to me
I ain't order no food but most these niggas cater for me
I ain't speaking on money, unless you fucking save it for me
I ain't speaking on love, unless you fucking gave it to me
Lookin' at a jedi, lighting on J, thinking life should be a wave
But I'd probably miss my red eye
But I got the next flight bookin you can bet I
Mr. get-the-job-done-right if you met I

[Chorus: Styles P]
All I ever knew was a couple flips
A couple outdoors and a couple ins
A couple pounds and a couple zips
A couple landed, a couple shipped
All I ever knew was a couple flips
A couple outdoors and a couple ins
A couple pounds and a couple zips
A couple landed, a couple shipped

[Verse 2: Berner]
This shit is pressure, make your lungs start hurtin'
My mouthpiece'll make your girl start workin'
All twenties in that duffle, shit is heavy
My dry room crazy, I can't wait 'til it's ready
Sour's by the truck, naw they ain't lock me up yet
Car full of killas, I get high when the guns click
I'm dumb rich
I'm riding dirty with a young bitch
All I know is my life changed off of one flip
I used to cut bricks, now I flip rooms, I'm hiding from task
Your favorite dope boy love me, I won't give him my math
I only touch the whole thing, I don't cut 'em in half
We get it there, count the money, then we smuggle it back
I turn five to a hundred, how you bubble like that?
I can change your whole life with hundred grand flat
This shit crazy, looking at my bust down
I'm outta town when they touch down, preach

[Chorus: Styles P]
All I ever knew was a couple flips
A couple outdoors and a couple ins
A couple pounds and a couple zips
A couple landed, a couple shipped
All I ever knew was a couple flips
A couple outdoors and a couple ins
A couple pounds and a couple zips
A couple landed, a couple shipped

[Verse 3: Berner & Styles P]
Outdoor season got your boy rich
A couple more years I'll hit the Forbes list
I left the gang, did a couple more flips
Fuck the middle man, we don't need to sort shit
Cut it down, freeze it all, no fake terps
Two bucks cheaper for the same work
They like Bern, what I gotta do?
Clean that money up 'fo we roll through (yeah)
Couple outdoors and a couple ins
You can be broke, catch up, get the mustard Benz
I don't lust pussy but I lust a M
I, double L, I, O N
Take a hit, then I puff again, I'm up again
Word to my son and my homies, fuck suffering
Custom cars, custom fit, keep the custom in
Word to BIG, I get that work through customs in
Ghost, nigga

[Chorus: Styles P]
All I ever knew was a couple flips
A couple outdoors and a couple ins
A couple pounds and a couple zips
A couple landed, a couple shipped
All I ever knew was a couple flips
A couple outdoors and a couple ins
A couple pounds and a couple zips
A couple landed, a couple shipped
