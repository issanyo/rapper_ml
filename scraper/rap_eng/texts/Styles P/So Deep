[Verse 1]
Exhale and ventilate
If you can't build and destroy then you renovate
Thoughts that innovate, blinding on the interstate
Back with the Devil when me and Death had a dinner date
Yeah, I'm a cynic but I don't know how the venom taste
Snake ain't I me, wolf is
Chip on my shoulder, another one where the tooth is
If I'm in the building then I'm probably where the roof is
Wonder it the angels' music is acoustic
Cause mine is electric
The depth of my soul can't be measure by the metric
Raised where it's hectic, black magic
And the flow is majestic
Magician on the tarot card
Ask myself can I disappear from Babylon
Been this and that, I could breathe in a store
Make the mannequins rap, what up

[Hook]
It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink

[Verse 2]
All my niggas going to war
I'm a go first, ask the guy where should I look
On a soul search, can't cross the bridge unless I pay the toll first
Can't make the point unless I score the goal first
Pull that sour kush, I don't roll dirt
Niggas will clap but you gotta give 'em a show first
Niggas is acting, improve your improv
The ride ain't pretty cause the life ain't no rim job
You gonna break down, the down breaks
Standing on shaky ground or you make the ground shake
Niggas will merk you for a pound cake
And then cry about it, down state
Till I blow ain't a nigga in the town safe
Outside pitching until the motherfucking mountain break
Don't you ever cop no ground weight
Lean on the white work, nigga, that's life work

[Hook]
It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink

[Verse 3]
In here for the insight, flow Gs, probably an OZ in my windpipes
Cloud of smoke on my frontal lobe
Told my niggas my vision is still tunnel, though
I could see the light at the end
I wonder why you know it's a mic at the end
In the audience still, I dream an end, tryna make about 40 a year

[Hook]
It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
