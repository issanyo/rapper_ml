[Intro]
Using each other to compete with, these subjects are a pity
‘Cause their minds are not witty like mines ah rada rada
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
You know that we roll with the keys to the city
And uh, she so high, she so with me, give me a plus one
I got my ego with me and I only fuck with paper
I’m eco-friendly, broads, I recycle ‘em and my RJ liking ‘em more
We in bars and are as high as the floors
The flyest couture, arrive and they eying the door
Trying to pour all the wine they were doubted before
And I be bagging them dimes at Kay Gag and it’s hard
To keep it straight now they walk around with name tags
The women I’m hitting, they letting me be
‘Cause I don’t fear a fucking thing but intimacy
They get in the jeep, beats are shaking the trunk
Late night to day light, my people waking up drunk
Rise and shine, who colder than this?
I don’t brag, I just know I’m the shit, yeah

[Hook]
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant so you know I’m the shit
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant, yeah I know I’m the shit
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant so you know I’m the shit
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant
Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant, yeah I know I’m the shit

[Verse Two: Styles P]
S-P, spit so (arrogant), clique so deep, flip ‘cause they arrogant
Chip on my shoulder, I’m just so arrogant, still move work
From Yonkers to Maryland, little shorty think I’m big headed
Get the little head, I’m headed where Big headed
Big faces in the briefcase, money under the mattress
I don’t even sleep straight, if you fly, what am I?
Drink the killer with a worm and piss a butterfly
Holding all toasts, hit the butter ride, do what I’m meant to do
Oscar de la hunt the suit, so classy but I look so good in it
Tre pound on me, still so hood in it, I’m simply not having it
Money magnet, bold and arrogant

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Asher Roth]
The sedums is condescending, sending a kind of scent
The nostrils get a type of sting, a narcissistic kind of thing
I often met with harp and strings and an operatic sing
When I walk inside the ring, you would thought that I had wings
On the softer side of things, I’m just an unrealistic optimist
My awesomeness is off the grid, an awesome kid anonymous
Got the hottest chick with a cock in her esophagus
All you other novices are obviously just talking shit
Hot dogging it, apartment smells mahogany
Carpentry and archery have all been called anomalies
Honestly, avant-garde of the artistry
Pardon the applause but they’ve all started calling me
(Bold and arrogant, they ain’t arrogant)
Won’t even perform if my oranges ain’t mandarin
Candles lit, little mayonnaise up on my sandwich
You don’t like my manners, you can handle it with management
