Styles P (Verse 1) We gon light up some sour to this one Fortes, zone the fuck out ya know? Shit real...
No matter the weather it's always cold
If you wanted to be there, you should've rode, now whoevers a rat should'n't of told, but you hop off the porch and put a foot in the Rolls, it's members only, in the members only, brown leather jacket like I'm Jon Voit, but I would never rat on a convoy, I'ma die a gangster and I'ma bring my moms joy, inhale again when the headspin, Ghost float, I probably spoken to dead men, I played Redman then seen red men, laying on the ground after niggas done let the lead spin, the toasters in the safe you put the bread in, fact, it's always a rat that let the feds in, that's why I always light weed with my brethren, if you got smoke well go head bring the meds in

King Buddha (Chorus 2x)
If you got it bring it in
Fuck them bottles if it's finished then roll again
Come with models, tell the models to roll with friends
That's the motto, only smokers can bring it in

Fortes (Verse 2)
Here's why I'm willing to bounce, the devil don't just knock at my door cause he lives in my house, my bars spoke to me, not the bars that I write I'm talking about the bars that the doctor wrote for me, only a few people left got hope for me, and I got this new diesel that ya'll gotta smoke for me, they call me 40 they don't ask me for a gram, we some mothafuckin wolves, ya'll are sacrificial lambs, you fraternize with people that you got nothing in common with, I'm just a hustler with a temper I just wanna flip, I'm at Juices For Life, my whip is double parked, motto is love is love, I need to sip a cup of bark, dip my joint in hash oil, put some keef on it, rather give somebody money than give em some free chronic, got a verse on the track and I made the beat on it, pound like a pillow but I never sleep on it

King Buddha (Chorus 2x)

Styles P (Verse 3)

It's always profit to gain, they say water cleanse the soul but I couldn't wash up the pain, think about the niggas that got the Glock at their brains or the homies in the cells that got locked in the chains, or the fiends in the hood you know they're popping their veins, and the pretty little girls that's only fucking for change, he a boy but he dress like a girl, this shit is strange, on a level do God and the Devil have this arranged? Am I insane or sane light a plane stay fly stay high and maintain, if you in the struggle you probably doing the same, but never sell your soul that shit ruins the game, thought of money and fame when I use to ride on the train, then I got my money and niggas ride in a range, walking on the air how Jordan glide in the lane, yeah the sun don't shine my niggas ride in the rain

King Buddha (Chorus 2x)
