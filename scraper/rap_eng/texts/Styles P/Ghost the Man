9th Wonder, what up? Eh

[Verse 1]
If you wonderin' what the jungle like
Listen to the me and then it make me think of my younger life
Never been on a hunger strike, but damn near starved
Got me reachin' for the sky, hope my hands near God
We just out here copin' 'til the plans get large
To see that money comin' in like the (-)
Yeah, I'm fly like Sam, I keep the (-)
But the streets, they ain't wild like a morphine drip
It's bananas on the block, they hammers on (-)
But the rooftop is the film and there's cameras on the cops
Shit, I ain't a critic, nigga, I had to live it
But that shit really hurt when you heard your nigga did it
That shit'll break you down, but a nigga won't admit it
It's the snapback days, I ain't even know the fitted
I might go and get it for the sake to be different
When you know he had it comin', bet the wake'll feel different
You really earned the money, but the cake will feel different
Stop runnin' from the cops, you will wake a little different
Them niggas in the deep and you thinkin' that you stuck with 'em
You ain't got to knock 'em, but you ain't got to fuck with 'em
Let 'em tell you different, then them niggas on some pussy shit
We be on that go-and-get-the-money-like-the-cookie shit
That sucker shit is for them other niggas
You ain't tryin' to cross
But don't you even come and fuck with niggas, nigga
