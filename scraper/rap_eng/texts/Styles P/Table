[Verse 1: Berner]
Sheesh
Just a week ago
Everything was sweet
I'm losing close friends
Money ain't shit
I'm sick of greed
I lit the weed then I crack the bottle
Will I see tomorrow?
I left it all for my daughter and my baby momma (I love y'all)
Sketchy drug deals got me here today
Pocket full of seeds, choppin' trees down in Uruguay
We go to jail and piss a year away
They don't see the value in life
Shit, I'm here to stay (I ain't goin' nowhere)
I fucked around and bought the gun show
Indoor for the head, sell all the sun grown (Outdoors)
Remember where you come from
'Cause acting brand new, that ain't something you could run from
Shit's changing yeah I'm still crazy
Fuck the world, that's how I feel lately (that's how I feel, yeah)
Put a couple joints in the air
I'm riding slow through the city in a brand new McClaren

[Hook: Berner]
A lot of money on the table
(Will I make it or not?)
A whole lot of money on the table
(They say I'm worth more dead than when I'm alive)
A lot of money on the table
(Will I make it or not?)
A whole lot of money on the table
(They say I'm worth more dead than when I'm alive)

[Bridge: Styles P]
Yeah Berner, talk that shit nigga

[Verse 2: Styles P]
They say real niggas never die (they say)
Word to my weed, I'm forever high
Money on the table some set aside
Been stop bangin', put my set aside
Probably out touring
Money on the dining room table, that's Ralph Lauren, yeah
Smoke on the kitchen table, more on the counter top (top)
I'm not around a lot (I'm not)
I'm touching pounds a lot
Probably in the foreign
Me without weed is the Fugees without Lauryn
The movie without a star
A speaker without a forum (get it)
Niggas don't feel me, fuck it I just ignore 'em, (fuck it) nigga
A foodsaver in a digi scale
Two lawyers on deck if you been to jail (two)
Money machine and the automatic
Money on the table and that mansion and we all can have it
Ghost

[Hook: Berner]
A lot of money on the table
(Will I make it or not?)
A whole lot of money on the table
(They say I'm worth more dead than when I'm alive)
A lot of money on the table
(Will I make it or not?)
A whole lot of money on the table
(They say I'm worth more dead than when I'm alive)

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Bern' be havin' a pack

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
What's there when you pop but gone when you not?
Your homies ain't solid, keep explainin' to cops
The weed man won't pick up the phone now
And every now and then you duck where you hang out
Three homies from your childhood memories timed out
You get addicted to sliding' slappin' the five in
The streets was our fathers'
Needed the Bentley, low mileage
Couldn't get it in college, we learned
The struggle made me appreciate every dollar I earned
I love to see my mother's face when I tell her to splurge
I did that
Chauffeur my daughter in my Maybach
That take me back to when we New Jack
And different color food stamps
But now I hurt the Berner with Style
And now I got Peruvian couch, nigga
In that terranean house
And now the millions come unannounced
You feel me?

[Hook: Berner]
Yeah
A lot of money on the table (money on the table)
(Will I make it or not?)
A whole lot of money on the table (money on the table)
(They say I'm worth more dead than when I'm alive)
A lot of money on the table (money on the table)
(Will I make it or not?)
A whole lot of money on the table (money on the table)
(They say I'm worth more dead than when I'm alive)
