[Intro: Styles]
Donell Jones, Holiday Styles, yeah, you ready for this
I hope so, listen to my boy blow, Untouchable baby...
No game I just kick it basic
I'm Holiday Styles and every pocket in my pants got big faces
Yeah I got twin bulks
When I tell you to put me down girl I ain't talkin about a insult
You should just hold me down
Light my blunts, count my money, load my rounds
Drive my V's, I'm locked down hide my keys
Need a chick that'll ride with me, what

[Chorus: Donell Jones]
If I lace you would you lace me back
If a blaze you would you blaze me back
Spendin big faces on the things you like
When you gonna put me down

[Verse 1: Donell Jones]
First time I saw you I was breatheless
Lookin flawless fifty on a necklace
And I had to, add you to my guestlist
Couldn't let you pass I had to put it down
We sipped and kicked a little convo
We start to head back to the condo
And I know what we both came here for
Let me know what your feelin now
Do you wanna open show me your love
Stop playin around put me down
Stop holdin back you gotta react, why your gonna hold me down
Your perkin put the work in, always flirtin got me hurtin
And you know I don't deserve this girl
Why your gonna hold me down

[Chorus: Donell Jones]
If I lace you would you lace me back
If a blaze you would you blaze me back
Spendin big faces on the things you like
When you gonna put me down
If I ride for you die for you
If I floss in any cost for you
Shorty all I wanna know from you
Is when your gonna put me down

[Verse 2: Donell Jones]
Shorty I'm not tryin to put a rush on you
Can't keep leavin me with my love on blue
Nobody's here, we better make a move
I wanna get into you (Wanna get into you)
You waillin to floss I really copped that
Frontin on my love now shorty stop that
What's it's gonna be when are we gonna put it down
I need your love right now
Do you wanna open show me your love
Stop playin around put me down
Stop holdin back you gotta react, why your gonna hold me down
Your perkin put the work in, always flirtin got me hurtin
And you know I don't deserve this girl
Why your gonna hold me down

[Chorus: Donell Jones]
If I lace you would you lace me back
If a blaze you would you blaze me back
Spendin big faces on the things you like
When you gonna put me down
If I ride for you die for you
If I floss in any cost for you
Shorty all I wanna know from you
Is when your gonna put me down

[Verse 3: Donell Jones]
On the, top floor in the president's suite
Hit the, tinted windows in the back of my jeep
Or your, friends house in the livin room couch
If you, let me hit it I'm a blaze it out
Won't you, open up let me come on in
And I, never stop we can do it again
Cause you, take it right where I wanna be
Got me in ecstacy

[Lady May]
Hanky panky, what did you ask me?
Wanna do the nasty in the back of your navi
Frankly, me not one of them skanky
Chicks in your arm one drink then it's on
Do you know, who your talkin to May Day AKA Miss Lady May
Peep my mind first then my family
Then I'll gladly introduce you to my panties
I'm barely blossoms I'm Godiva, I'm Destiny's Child I'm a survivor
So when you clowns stop effin around
I'm gettin daps when I put you down, down

[Styles]
If it's green and it's made out of paper, I'm a get it
She look mean so wherever I take her, I'm a hit it
But not the back truck the seats feel comfortable
I don't think you a skank I wanna get it crunk with you
I know you a lady ma (I know you a lady)
But you ridin with a gangsta girl gotta keep it gravy ma
Just listen when my foot be down
And I'm far from a clown so just put me down

[Chorus: Donell Jones]
If I lace you would you lace me back
If a blaze you would you blaze me back
Spendin big faces on the things you like
When you gonna put me down
If I ride for you die for you
If I floss in any cost for you
Shorty all I wanna know from you
Is when your gonna put me down
If I lace you would you lace me back
If a blaze you would you blaze me back
Spendin big faces on the things you like
When you gonna put me down
If I ride for you die for you
If I floss in any cost for you
Shorty all I wanna know from you
Is when your gonna put me down
