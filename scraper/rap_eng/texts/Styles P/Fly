[Intro: Styles P]
Tylers Woods, Blacksaun, Sofi Green, S.P
Shit is gracious, my nigga
Fly niggas, yeah

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Came from the hood with the best 'caine, love the block
I'd rather have knots on a yacht or a jetplane
Play the game, fuck the ref name
Either it's the exit or the left lane 'cause niggas makin' moves
My vision is a fly vision, standin' in the white sand
Starin' at the ocean then I dive in
Nike flip-flops, the ones with the cushion in 'em
Before I get to the mirror, reflection is lookin' in it
Look at the whip, maybe a pusher's in it
Maybe a hookers is in it
If he's in the kitchen, then he's cookin' in it
Dir-dirty money keep me occupied
Pretty women rule when the shotta fly, real so I'm ostracized
Playin' Chaka Khan in a Five that was modified
Find me on the streets or Spotify
Yeah, I'm humorous so I tell niggas, "humor us"
Bank account is large, the problems are numerous
Ghost

[Chorus: Tyler Woods]
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyy)
Yeah, you see these clothes, yeah, you see these wheels
(Highhhhhhhhhhh)
Niggas on these strains, niggas on these pills
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyyy)
Yeah, you see this house, yeah, you see this watch
(Highhhhhhhhhhh)
Lit off this smoke, lit off this shot

[Verse 2: Sofi Green & Tyler Woods]
Yo, this pretty features for the feature with the Ghost
I'm a dime dressed up, they say I'm Ether out my clothes
G right, the Queensbridge speakers bumpin' [?]
Switch the windows in Miami 'cause it's freezin' in the snow (livin')
The silky trophy lookin' bitch you niggas know
A hunnid grand, nigga? I'ma need nine hunnid mo' (let's get it)
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyy)
P-P-Plenty benjis in that Goyard, is D.C. holdin' your blow? (D.C.)
(Highhhhhhhhhhh)
Bunch up, double up in that Gucci Figaro (Gucci)
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyy)
And them bitches throw us out, I'ma season it some mo'

[Chorus: Tyler Woods]
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyy)
Yeah, you see these clothes, yeah, you see these wheels
(Highhhhhhhhhhh)
Niggas on these strains, niggas on these pills
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyyy)
Yeah, you see this house, yeah, you see this watch
(Highhhhhhhhhhh)
Lit off this smoke, lit off this shot

[Verse 3: Styles P & Tyler Woods]
Acres of square feet, fly in the Benz on my bare feet
I wear the clothes, they don't wear me
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyy)
I'm already in the sky, why would niggas try to air me?
(Highhhhhhhhhhh)
Got a line on the plug, every strain into [?] (got a line)
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyy)
I got dirty money bands in a bag that she carries

[Chorus: Tyler Woods]
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyy)
Yeah, you see these clothes, yeah, you see these wheels
(Highhhhhhhhhhh)
Niggas on these strains, niggas on these pills
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyyy)
Yeah, you see this house, yeah, you see this watch
(Highhhhhhhhhhh)
Lit off this smoke, lit off this shot

[Outro: Tyler Woods & Styles P]
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyy)
Yeah, you see these clothes, yeah, you see these wheels
(Highhhhhhhhhhh)
Niggas on these streets, niggas on these pills
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyyy)
Yeah, you see these clothes, yeah, you see these wheels
(Highhhhhhhhhhh)
Niggas on these strains, niggas on these pills
(Flyyyyyyyyyyyyy)
Yeah, you see this house, yeah, you see this watch
(Highhhhhhhhhhh)
Lit off this smoke, lit off this shot
