[Intro/Chorus]
Don't put 'em down til' I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard-headed'll find out what the shell do
Now you can put 'em down if when you want
[????]

[Verse 1: Styles P]
I'm still gettin' L-O-X yellow money
Yellow Air Forces, yellow Lex money
Jada the "muah"; give 'em the kiss of death for me
A big Donnie G'll rip his head off for me
D to the dash and the block after that
The nine mill drawn, and then it pop after that
Your brain on the floor, who wanna mop after that?
The Ghost on the mic, now who could rock after that?
It's like only a few brothers
I'm hittin' two bitches, so I'm using two rubbers
You make it rain on them bitches
Then I make 'em pay for all the game that they missin'

[Chorus]
Don't put 'em down til' I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard-headed'll find out what the shell do
Now you can put 'em down if when you want
[????]

[Verse 2: Styles P]
I'mma die filthy rich, or piss-pot poor
Violatin' the crew what you get shot for
In lyrical shape niggas, tip-top ya'll
Know the money's comin' in when the bricks dropped off
Me and the gun and the pretty bitch up in the vehicle
Still pass her around like Biggie and Cease'll do
Yeah, Frank White is still alive to me
I don't meant the label, but most of you niggas jive to me
Can't find a rapper alive, that's as live as me
If you did, it's a motherfuckin' surprise to me
I pass 'em the title, "the hardest nigga out"
And then give 'em my guns; yeah, your nigga out

[Chorus]
Don't put 'em down til' I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard-headed'll find out what the shell do
Now you can put 'em down if when you want
[????]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
You ain't concerned, it's the papes
I sold base when Goodie Mob was on LaFace
The gun ain't big enough, you can fit it on your waist
I'm thinkin' of money, when my thumb is on the safe
Pointy finger on the trigger
Cops show a picture, there's no pointin' at a nigga
A dead man can't move
And the shooter might be, but the lead ain't smooth; take it easy
Cocaine bamboo-colored; got your girl on my hair like shampoo, brother
And the gun's titanium, handle's rubber
You expired; just got cancelled from us
What up!?

[Chorus/Outro]
Don't put 'em down til' I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard-headed'll find out what the shell do
Now you can put 'em down if when you want
[????]
