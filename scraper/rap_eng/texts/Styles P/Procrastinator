The seed of Abraham
Ended up to be a war
Good Johnny Walker
That I can't drink anymore
I see the flowers
Are rotting down in my yard
Any disaster
Is just a matter of
TIME TIME TIME
I NEED IT TO GET BY YOUR SIDE
I NEED TO DECIDE IF I'M WRONG OR RIGHT
I NEED IT TO MAKE UP MY MIND

They said I'm offside
I'll never get any goal
I had a function
I was the one with a soul
Nobody likes me
Nobody catches me if I fall
Any disaster
Is just a matter of
TIME TIME TIME
I NEED IT TO GET BY YOUR SIDE
I NEED TO DECIDE IF I'M WRONG OR RIGHT
I NEED IT TO MAKE UP MY MIND
