[Intro]
Yea Poovs
Tunnel vision on these niggas
Araab, this shit is crack, Duke salute
My eyes on the prize

[Verse 1]
Phantom but not at the opera (Phantom!)
Death of the doctor
Shotty and chopper, hand gun or the hawk
Yea Pinero is proper (I'm proper!), certified
Hop up in the whip, you willin' to take the murder ride
Rolling with that Ecuadorians, Cubans, coke emporium (hahaha)
Came up, doing G shit real gangsta historian (I'm a gangsta)
On the real my nigga
I never squeal and I never do no sucker shit
Go out on my shell (I go out)
Yea, shoot my brains out, shoot my heart out
Catch me at the juice bar, pourin a little bark out
Catch me on the mic, just give it a little spark out (put out!)
I'm electrified, and you petrified
You niggas buggin me, spray a little pesticide
I take face shots, you could put the vest aside(put it away!)
No need for em bloody, you gon bleed for em (you gon bleed for em!)
You gon be the one to hold his dick when you pee for him (yeup)
Cuz he paralyzed, look at the barrel size (look at it!)
And I ain't buyin that gangsta shit you advertise (I ain't buyin it)
You a fixable problem
Kill him in Yonkers and dump the body in Harlem (Oohh)
I’m despicable, with a hawk and revolver
Ask the shooter or a carver if the ghost, is the hardest (Ghost!)
The answer's always yes (always)
So you could fuck around, cause it's always death, waddup?

Yea, should be a hook lemme just pop a little shit right here though
You niggas is nowhere near ready
I can't even figure me out

[Verse 2]
Every rapper reppin' the set, I know they pussy though
Take my knife, stick it up in 'em, like they a pussy hole (hahaha)
Yea I been a boss, but then my cars all verbal
And a hoopty playin' verbal intercourse (Figure it out)
It's foul thoughts when I'm reeing up
Cause I don't mean the ball court, when I say they D-in up (they D-in up)
I break the laws, fuck the court of law
Penny never seen, with a dime or a quarter so (never seen)
And I’d rather die before a dime or a quarter y'all
But you could get killed for your motherfuckin Audemar (get killed nigga) (get killed nigga)
But I ain't got time for time (nah uh)
Dancing in the shadows of the shadows, no time to shine (you do that)
I take the digits though, you don't get the picture nigga
I'm Samsung, lil' nigga you Vizio
I'm a better show, and a better sound
You don't get the picture for the paper, spread the lead around (patna!)

[Outro]
Fuck everything Poovs
I ain't even wanna sign off, I'm just rappin'
