[Intro: Jadakiss]
Turn the mic up a little bit..
Let me get some heat generated up in this muh'fucker
This is real hood shit
Ok.. Yap.. Uh.. Yea. Yo

[Hook: Jadakiss]
Yo.. I do it all but I hustle like a muh'fukcer
Get it off nigga, hustle like a muh'fukcer
Fuck the law nigga, hustle like a muh'fucker
Hustle, hustle, yeah hustle like a muh'fucker

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Blue suits hate me
The narcs can't stand me
The DA hoping she catch a nigga with the swammy
Im just tryna make a few dollars to feed my family
The gears are slipping on the hoopti
I need the tranny
I'm out here, in a track suit
And some shell toes
The work ain't potent
But its strong enough to sell though
Can't even lie dawg I'd rather be on Melrose
But I got a quota to make before Chanel close
The connect hold me down, if I debt him then I'm a gonna
The work is half gone and the rent is around the corner
Ain't nothing like getting a nigga when you dont wanna
That just means that I'm a be in the trap untill the morning
Cause I hustle

[Hook: Jadakiss] X 2

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Started with an 8-ball
Ended up with kilos
For the bricks like the louisville players
Rip the team off
Carlo Gambino with a coke pot
Same G in common[?] of the dope block
Thirty thirty off the roof, faggot make your throat pop
Or your head pop, Yall little niggas is funny like Redd Foxx
Or Eddie Murphy or Richard Pryor
See the team over there, the whole click fire
Until they sick and tired, of being sick and tired
I dont even talk when I deal, incase the brick is wired
Gun is like me in the booth, shit is spittin fire
Buck another sucka, hustle like a muh'fucka

[Hook: Jadakiss] X 2

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Uh jumped up off the porch, but ya'll was only seventeen
So inspired by them zoes, getting major cream
Fucking bitches, twenty-sixes came from triple beams
Dont recognize you in the hood, my youngest play the scene
True story, words to ma momma hommie
Them killers show up at your Christian ceremony
Cold hearted, chiefing like Bob Marley
Black ten ones, never did that Ed Hardy
I was out here, still a nigga out here
Hustlin like a muhfucka with my strap in there
I was paranoid, ducking 'em color boys
They catch me slipping, might just send me to Illnois
Shit done got real I just need a meal
When you broke, ain't nothing funny, dont know how it feel
Niggas snitchin like them bitches, must I keep it real
I never been no pussy Im a die trill
