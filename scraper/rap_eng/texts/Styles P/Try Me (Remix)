[Intro: Jadakiss]
Yeah, yeah you know what it is niggas, straight off top
D-Block, L-O-X, shout to my Detroit niggas
Dej, what's up, baby?

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo, let a nigga try me, try me
I ain't got a problem lettin' bullets fly, B
And if you lookin', you know where to find me
Probably on Dyckman with a mami
I don't use them chrome thangs 'cause they too shinny (ughn)
Fuck around and identify me
Need cash up front, I don't do consignment (nah)
Killin' shit since them niggas signed me
Better be attempted murder or a yommy (yup)
If you motherfuckers try to line me
I'mma comment myself so you can't calm me (never)
More guns than the fuckin' army
When I used to have the B-M-X with the Knobbies
Sellin' Coke Just became a hobby

[Bridge: Dej Loaf & Jadakiss]
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and have them killers spray you with the shotty
I wish a nigga would

[Chorus: Dej Loaf & Sheek Louch]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
(shhyeah, I got 'em [?])
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
(Kiss said we gotat get on this shit ASAP, nigga)
And I ain't playin with nobody
This is the remix! I got this!
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
You don't really want to try me, try me
You ain't see these big gorilla niggas right behind me
Run up on you, leave your body layin' in the lobby
I'ma rapper but the burner, nigga, that's my hobby
And I ain't fallin' for the talkin', nigga, we gon' pop it
We gon' clap it till the blue shirts try to come and stop it
Where the drugs and all the money that you rap about, bro?
What models? All I'm seein' is a hood rat hoe
And I ain't scared, I'm a thug until my fuckin' day come
L-O-X, I keep it real with my fuckin' day one
New York City, fuck where all these other rappers come from
Line 'em up and hit they body with a big chain gun
Ignorant but yeah I'm lovin' all this fuckin' gun play
Mr. Chow leave your brain all on your chicken satay
D-Block, you should know them Yonkers niggas don't play
It's a warnin' to you cowards, listen what the hook say
You don't really wanna

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Try me, it's mommy and daddy
It's getting high me that be doin' it gladly
Ridin' in that Caddie or that Navi
Pop him in the head, then I make it my avi
Stompin' on my Nikes like some Bruno Maglis
First you get the work then you get you the baggies (try me)
I body your auntie, it's Murder Inc. like Ja Rule, Ashanti
Fly me like Gotti, Teflon
Lambo, two Ferarris, it's stepped on
I'm grimey, it's a high me, D-Block
They all slump, new pump I call Reebok
They know me at the coke spot and weed spot
I'll get your little cousin killed with your uncle with knees shots
So try me, try me
I'll see you be the next dead nigga I throw in my diary

[Chorus: Dej Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body

[Outro: Styles P]
Try me, try Louch, try Kiss
You try L-O-X, that'll be the last mother fuckin' thing you try
Nigga
Yeah
L-O-X
