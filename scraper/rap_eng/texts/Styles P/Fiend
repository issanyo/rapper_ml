[Verse 1 - Styles P]
She's more than a dime, she's a dub
Damn I'm in love
Hit it from the house to the club
Keep my mind on her
Spend my last dime on her
She bring me to cloud 9 when my ass climb on her
Can see she make the picture clear
Just like time warner
Treat her like the car
The weight of the ride on her
She helped me focus in
Get my rhymes right too
And my mind right too
That's why she shine through

[Verse 2 - Jaheim]
I gotta quit
I gotta get this chick up out my system
She's no good for me
All of my dogs wanna hit her
Right after I'm with her
I eat then I fall asleep
And it's gettin costly
Lately all I've been banging is the chicks that come to see
But surely she's a dime
(Something about the girl being a dog)
And I think I'm falling in love
She gets me all chocked up
I can barely catch my breath
Don't want to pass her around
I keep her to myself
You see shes gives me stimulation
And nobody's messing up our rotation
Although I think it's big
And you better believe
Nobody's blazing it up but me

[Hook: Jaheim]
I need her first thing when I wake up
Call me a fiend
And I ain't talking about nicotine
Y'all know what I mean
Just call me a fiend
I'm just a addict for your love, I've got to have it all your love
I can't let it go
I'll never be gleem
You can just call me a fiend

[Verse 3 - Jaheim]
I twist her up, pull her to me real slow (so slow)
Let the taste of a chocolate make my eyes get low
But she burns through my paper so fast
Gotta make it last
Hate to watch them Swisha sweets walk past
When my personal stash get low
Then it's back to the block tryna find her
Surely she's a dime
In fact that girls a dub
And I think I've fallin in love
She gets me all chocked up
I can barely catch my breath
Don't want to pass her around
I keep her to myself
You see shes gives me stimulation
And nobody's messing up our rotation
Although I think it's big
You better believe
Nobody's blazing it up but me

[Hook: Jaheim]

[Verse 4 - Styles P]
I'm a fiend for her
Go to sleep wit a dream of her
Wake up, grind hard, get cream for her
Play the whip on a lean wit her
Just in case I don't make it home
I'mma leave a team with her
Me & her been down since her head was round
I went to every party in town and bought her a round
And now she get lose with it
Her heads purple and green but she looks cute with it
And I ain't mad at her
I let the team take a stab at her
I bring her home all alone and then pack her bags for her
We can do it all night, right?
Wake up and do it all day
All we needs a light bright

[Verse 5 - Jaheim]
It's gunna be a slow process
One kiss from her lips took the stress up off my chest
Riding shot gun, body tight, couldn't hold it in
Had to park and spark it up again
And I swear she left her heaven scent in the air
All in my clothes, all in my hair
(She has my head in her )
Y'all know what I'm talking about

[Hook: Jaheim]
