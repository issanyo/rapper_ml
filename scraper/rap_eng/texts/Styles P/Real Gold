Sometimes it's hard to get all over again
And stop to think I don't belong to the band
I'm stuck with thoughtsâ€¦ I better let 'me apart
Sometimes I wish I had it back from the start
I'm on the run, the winning bet
The golden boy, but I smell crap
"It's just a matter of time" that's what they said
And what I want is a start, It's comin' over so
MAKE ME REAL GOLD
THE LIFE I WAS EXPECTING IS SO NEAR
AND ON AND ON TO ME, IT'S COMIN' OVER TO ME AGAIN
THIS TIME I'M TAKING THE CHANCE
Well you can seat or stand as well
Just a couple of lines I get the swell
In a couple of hour this is hell
It's because of your hugs that I stand still
Put the spotlight on me all night and day
Make room for trophy and save a way
To get out of this crap fucked up refrain
It's comin' over to me, it's comin' over to
MAKE ME REAL GOLD
THE LIFE I WAS EXPECTING IS SO NEAR
AND ON AND ON TO ME, IT'S COMIN' OVER TO ME AGAIN
THIS TIME I'M TAKING THE CHANCE
Fucked up refrain fucked up refrain
'cause I just wanted a start for you and me
But it's tougher than hell or so it seems
It's comin' over to me, it's comin' over to
MAKE ME DAVE GROHL
THE LIFE I WAS EXPECTING IS SO NEAR
AND ON AND ON TO ME, IT'S COMIN' OVER TO ME AGAIN
THIS TIME I'M TAKING THE CHANCE
