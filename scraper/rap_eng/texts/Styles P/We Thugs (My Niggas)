[Jadakiss]
For the best of life...
For if I ride you ride the motherfucking rest of life

[Hook: Styles]
We thugs, my niggas
Ride to the death with my man cause I motherfucking love my niggas
We ghetto, my niggas
Any time, any place, we don't give a fuck we bust metal, my niggas
We gangsta my niggas

We D-Block niggas, we don't play games
We just hit you in your frame cause we pop niggas

[Jadakiss]
Aiyyo, yo, I'mma shed blood for mine, that's one ritual

[Styles]
That's how you keep the love unconditional

[Jadakiss]

[Styles]
Bitches buy records but niggas do what bitches do

[Jadakiss]

[Styles]
And they way smarter then the white kids in Yale

[Jadakiss]
But that how life is

[Styles]
And that how the gun and the knife is

[Jadakiss]

[Styles]
When ya come through and fishtail in Hennesey Viper

[Jadakiss]
Listen, it ain't the rappers it's the rats that worry me

[Styles]
Double R for life, D-Block til they bury me

[Jadakiss]
Scared niggas shed off
Or stand way in the back and aim they gat up in the air and...

[Styles]

[Jadakiss]
Thorough niggas tear nigga head off, then let the blood keep drippin...

[Styles]
And just wipe the sweat off
