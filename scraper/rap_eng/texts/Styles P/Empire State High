Lettin the heat spread, yeah 4th day on a week day
Lettin the heat spread, yeah 4th day on a week day
A real strong man hear out what the weak say
Real small wolves tryina sleep where the sheep stay
Told you it's a sport like EA
But it'll cut you and eat half, yea just like the DJ
Check 1-2, check come through
Cashin and bringin up, that's what the slums do
Either you know or you don't
Either you will or you won't
We could leave it at that
I'm the sick scare, clutching it, leavin in hat
The aperon hold the season
And I ain't stopping for the cops cuz the weed stay
Got some work and I'm gunnin the club, it's kinda funny
But you always runnin ahead, runnin from love
Yea, fuck the cops, slip the flick plate
I just bounce til it gets straight, get safe
Tryina get money, pop the cork, let the coupe fly
Get empire state building roof high
We turn one into two types
2 into 4-5's, yea we get alright
Tryina get money, pop the cork, let the coupe fly
Get empire state building roof high
We turn one into two types
2 into 4-5's, yea we get alright
Sal with some hash, burning the stash
You would think it from the self, I'm a rock school dash
Smile on my face like everything funny
I don't understand broke, all I do is talk money
All I do is see green, I'm a currency fiend
500 horses in that white Selly
First class, sitting like an African king
That's Frank Luke on him, get coke from Beijing
Nop, don don, caught a ki
See me? Niggas don't eat, Ramadan
White Airs, ball shorts, pajamas on
They callin me Jerry Lewis, telethon
Tryina get money, pop the cork, let the coupe fly
Get empire state building roof high
We turn one into two types
2 into 4-5's, yea we get alright
Tryina get money, pop the cork, let the coupe fly
Get empire state building roof high
We turn one into two types
2 into 4-5's, yea we get alright
Couple niggas on the red side
Couple niggas on the blue side
Arise when I hoop fly
Stand up niggas, lookin for where the truth lies
All shout a shoe 5
Man I'm Tryina get money, pop the cork, let the coupe fly
Get empire state building roof high
Higher than the hollin cloud
But I'm still like a werewolf howling
Like I'm born in the chamber, you're shouting out
Impeccable tour style
No Iron Maiden to kill me, you can't block my slow style
Nor the fast one, the master, the last one
Tryina get money, pop the cork, let the coupe fly
Get empire state building roof high
We turn one into two types
2 into 4-5's, yea we get alright
Tryina get money, pop the cork, let the coupe fly
Get empire state building roof high
We turn one into two types
2 into 4-5's, yea we get alright
