[Intro - Kid Ink]
Said I ain't tryna put no pressure but this high last forever
I ain't tryna put no pressure but this high..(I Said)

[Hook - Kid Ink]
It don't matter the time, I spark it
If you really wanna get high, I spark it
Light Up The Whole Place, I spark It
See them Bottles Comin My Way, I spark it
Right before I burn it down

Stay fired up, burn one
Stay Fired up (yeah)
You know that, you know that
I stay fired up, burn one
Stay Fired up (yeah)
You know that, you know..

[Bridge - Kid Ink]
When it comes to the dro (that's what I know)
When it comes to the hoes ( that's what I know)
When it comes to the drinks (that's what I know)
When it comes to the bank (that's what I know)

[Verse 1 - Kid Ink]
Yup
That's what I know
That kush, that's what I blow
That Ten, that's my ho
This life, that's what I chose
Got the city all on my back, team from on my hat
It's just me and my posse on the broadway like CATS (Hol up)
Bitch! Lights Out, I don't even know what the hype 'bout
I ain't been high since sixteen, when I use to hang in the sixties
Bet them motherfuckas miss me, now a nigga ball like six rings
Tryna take off to the moon, just hit up my phone
And call me rocketship, Shawty Opposite of them guys you with, honestly
This life I live will make you feel like you was fucking omniscient
I ain't promising that, you gon like it
But really open your eyelids, we fired up right here
I said..

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Styles P]
Roll up, park it up
I roll up, spark it up
So dope, so rap
Everything to tear the market up
Get fly, get high
Chocolate Diesel just to get by
Girl scout cookies, six five
Ghost in the shit, and the shit lie
Me and my niggas like the flavor strain
Make a lot of money, watch your neighbors change
Switch to computer, watch the data change
All of my guns come with the laser aim

Daytime, we spark it up
Night time, we spark it up
Juice Bar, we Bark it up
Drop the body roll a carpet up
Ghost in, roll the carpets out
Red ones, match my eyes
Yeah niggah, ???

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro] (4x)

Burn One
Go Ahead And Burn One
Nigga
Burn one
