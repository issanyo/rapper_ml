[Intro]

[Verse 1: Styles P]
I used to touch keys like a piano
Bitch, I'm with Jadakiss and Sheek Luciano
Used to push the Lexus with work up in the panel
Or the door or in the bumper
How much work could you handle, take it all
I’mma pump her
Got a block that was clickin
Niggas, that was tripping
Sat ‘em down, told my niggas ain’t no eatin where you shittin'
Ain’t no shittin' where you’re sleeping
Keep it quiet, no speaking and we all living decent
Trying to stay up out the precinct
Yeah, niggas know the circle (you know!)
Move rectangles and we still like purple, yeah
Loyalty is a virtue
The homies on parole, get him home before his curfew
Niggas wanna pop, you better merc them before they merc you
Homie, you can plan to have a plan for you
Pay cash to have a skin for you
We’re talking paper for every trip
In the Mazi riding naked in every whip
If I'm bullshittin cause I am a bull
Ridin low with a Hugh Hef centerfold
With two guns in my winter coat
If you know the connect, then nigga rent a boat
Fuck the coast guard, I told you that the Ghost hard
I’ll be in Dubai now, send the hood to coast guard
Used to be expendable now I’m just expandable
Team full of niggas that'll shoot like the cameras do
Like Lecter and Smith yeah both for the Hannibals
Smart and need shit, stay upon my street shit, nigga

[Hook: Tyler Woods]
I'm just trying to live my life
Get this money and follow my dreams (my dreams)
In the city of do or die
Me and my niggas ain't playin no games
Now ain't that
Ghetto
For ya
I'm never gon let go of these sterets
Til the day i die
I'm a hustler, baby

[Verse 2: Chris Rivers]
Bathe in the ambiance
Hip-hop’s new phenomenon
The confidant too conscious on the higher planes I drop the bombs
Stomping on incompetent
Rappers with my pajamas on
Knocking on the skulls of heroes and then go to comic-con
Constant nonsense, I guess adopt the concept
That my flow is god sent
Compare my comic content
To when you cop a 9 tec
See, I drop the contest
I just got to conquest like how’s this kid not on yet
I guess in due time, I do shine, brighter then nuclear fusion
Thinking faster than two minds, you niggas don’t spark like neutrons
I’m a proton, I’m so gone, electrifying aces with my cadence
I’m amazement with a face and bars like photons
I'm disastrous, a catalyst for hip hop coming back and this
Immaculate
Rapping with
Would serve like Jay the Lazarus
I bring it back to life
Plus my swag is too precise
I mean my decadence is heaven sent
Excuse your average heights
And excuse your sacrifice
If you decide to grasp the mic
After I previously blessed it like it was my acolytes (blessed)
Do you sense my appetite
Do you fill my hunger building
If you try to stop me now would be a kamikaze kill
But you will never kill the skill
It's the skills that pay the bills
And if I'm thinking with that logic all my bank accounts are filled
And I would never be distilled, my potency stretch overseas
I'm overly creative like my vocal chords are ovaries
Chris Rive's and the ocp [?]
Tighten up your hostess, G
You're shooting at the stars, no your bullets couldn't come close to these
