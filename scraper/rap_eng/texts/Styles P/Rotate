[Verse 1: B-Real]
Shifting lines from the paradigm sublime
On the streets of Cali, yo it's grind time
Wanna see my name in lights like a star gleaming
I wanna make you feel somethin, exorcise your demons
Every day's a struggle, tryna make a bundle
How can you stay humble when the streets love you
I got a bad habit, I'm a winning-addict
Living in sin, tragic life is fucking short damn it
Can't afford wasting time when life happens
Gotta get to everyday like the days of trappin'
Now we worldwide, it means worlds collide
And we killing everything, so ride or die

[Chorus: Cozmo]
We move, work it, low rates through the whole State
And watch the money rotate
All gas, no brakes 'til my dough's straight
Now watch the money rotate
Now watch the money rotate
Now watch the money rotate
Whether the streets are rapping we get it both ways
Now watch the money rotate

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Lost in the smoke, I know I came from nothing
Inhale, exhale like the pain is nothing
Picada drops and not even rain could touch 'em
Talks real cheap if it's the same discussion
Turn on the beat, the feejees (?) came from puffin'
Hit a strain, spit flame and leave you a brain concussion
We don't play games so none of you niggas call foul
New York nigga, but you know I'm smoking that North Cal'
See ya landing in, we headed right to the board now
Rather smoke four pounds than hit you with the four pound
So you want juice, then visit me at the store now
I was getting tore now, before I tore a tour down
Global 4G star, hit you with the full clam
I got to burn it, let's be real
I'm with Berner and B-Real
Twenty-four-seven high is always how I P feel

[Chorus: Cozmo]
We move, work it, low rates through the whole State
And watch the money rotate
All gas, no brakes 'til my dough's straight
Now watch the money rotate
Now watch the money rotate
Now watch the money rotate
Whether the streets are rapping we get it both ways
Now watch the money rotate

[Verse 3: Berner]
All dedication, no education
Living life every day like I'm on vacation
Beach houses seem to be my favorite destination
Fake friends, I'm sick of seeing smiling faces
Look, twenty years got him shook
Another loss took, cold hearted crook
What a vision I just wanna see my daughter smile
Money pile in the closet man that shit is wild
Love the struggle, it just made the hunger much realer
I'm on top, millionaire, ex drug-dealer
I bet the smoke in my lung burn much cleaner
Than burnt rot with a toolie on those street-sweepers
Bulletproof Cadillac that shit is presidential
Pretty model bitch, got great potential
Dirty money hidden all in the Renault
Top dog in the game, I'm on another level

[Chorus: Cozmo]
We move, work it, low rates through the whole State
And watch the money rotate
All gas, no brakes 'til my dough's straight
Now watch the money rotate
Now watch the money rotate
Now watch the money rotate
Whether the streets are rapping we get it both ways
Now watch the money rotate
