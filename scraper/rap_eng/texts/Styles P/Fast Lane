[Intro]
Yeah, D block
Gotta stay fresh cause I live by my last name, Styles
You know what time it is
And they ain't make 'em like me in a while
Know we ain't fuckin' talkin' too much this year
Styles, and they ain't make 'em like me in a while

[Verse 1]
Whattup Buzzy? Whattup cuzzy?
You could get popped if you skinny or you chubby
Catch me on the push if the kush look fuzzy
? stand a gentleman, everybody love me
Catch me in the Chevrolet
Every day thinkin' of a better way
A long way from robberies and getaways, strugglin'
Cocaine and baking soda bubblin'
Do it for my homies on trial verse the government
Of the United States
On the creep, don't sleep stay wide awake
Life is like chess, but never forget the checkers
Try to jump, get the pump or hit with the trifecta
That's the tre pound, or the tre eight
Even furious Styles couldn't keep Tre safe
Let it do what it do
But if you don't get it done then you should do somethin' new
My homies get it in then I'mma do somethin' too
Matter of fact, I'mma do somethin' first
You could set it off, I'mma do somethin' worse
Yeah, I'm just tryin' to get cash
Live four and die six letters with a dash
The diesel taste good, but it's better with the hash
Like a Channel 5 show, yeah the veteran's a mash
Yeah I might brag, but it's never about cash
If I got it and my homie don't, I gotta move fast
One for all, all for one, brand nubians
In them hotel rooms with Peruvians
Cubans, Columbians, Dominicans, hooligans
If I'm in the spot, then you know I got the ruger in
S-P the ghost, you couldn't walk in the shoes I'm in

[Outro]
I'm livin' life in-live-livin' life in
Livin' life in the fast lane
Gotta stay fresh cause I live by my last name, Styles
Styles
And they ain't make 'em like me in a while, Styles
And they ain't make 'em like me in a while
