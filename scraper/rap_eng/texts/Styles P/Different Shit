[Intro]
I'm hustlin' tryna' get out of the city and you tryin' hustle to get to me
I got plans, I can't get it on in [?] jungle
And when I get it together my way, I'm going back home
To clean air and open space, I'm doin' my thing

[Verse 1]
Machine
Ghost
My nigga, I'm on some cool shit
'Cause I'm in the money, not in the bullpens
You should be into fuckin', not in the bullshit
Smokin' a balcony, daiquiris by the pool, kid
Splurge on the late night menu
I sail off away, the thirty-eight might end you
No longer sellin' raw, I'm an entrepeneur
Take a good look, you ain't seen a monster before
Yeah, I'm real ghetto, you ain't been to Yonkers before
My young days was two guns up, blowin' dumb haze
Real quick to shoot at a nigga, even on Sundays
Yeah, I changed, I ain't the same fella
Ask the wifey what she think about the Range, yella
We smokin' on the beach, drinkin' pain killers
You ain't a gain, I got guns but y'all ain't killers, nah
But a body's nothin' to brag about
I'm tryna' find my chi, you want the dragon out?
Nigga, fuck yo' set, whatchu flag about?
Niggas is pussy so, fuck it, I pull a Magnum out

[Chorus]
Game is fact with some fiction in it
Slang with some diction in it
Peaceful, but I hurt you, does that make me a hypocrite?
Liquor, pour a fifth of it
Leaf, roll a splif of it
Always act the same, but I'm always on some different shit
Game is fact with some fiction in it
Slang with some diction in it
Peaceful, but I hurt you, does that make me a hypocrite?
Liquor, pour a fifth of it
Leaf, roll a splif of it
Always act the same, but I'm always on some different shit
Always act the same, but I'm always on some different shit

[Verse 2]
The joint lit, I got appointments
If you ain't talkin' 'bout cash, then it's pointless
I got a itchin', gettin' moneys the ointment
Niggas get you shot in the face over a coin-flip
Couple a bucks ain't enough
Never on Front street, rather lay in the cut
Paddle shift cool but I'd rather play with the clutch
Silence is golden, never sing it enough
My mama told me to shoosh
No tellin' and no tellin' what I'm doin' to crooks
What I'm doin' with books is getting information, yeah
Call the cleaner, fix the situation, yeah
When I rhyme its like a dissertation
Whether its vocal or verbal, the hood hoppin' the hurdles
Shit hurt your heart when your homie is tryna' burn you
Puttin' in work, the sweat soaked in your thermal
Give people my pain, never wrote in a journal
Maybe I outta do it, but maybe I'm talkin' through it
Every line when I rhyme, my nigga, recorder to it
Truth

[Chorus]
Game is fact with some fiction in it
Slang with some diction in it
Peaceful, but I hurt you, does that make me a hypocrite?
Liquor, pour a fifth of it
Leaf, roll a splif of it
Always act the same, but I'm always on some different shit
Game is fact with some fiction in it
Slang with some diction in it
Peaceful, but I hurt you, does that make me a hypocrite?
Liquor, pour a fifth of it
Leaf, roll a splif of it
Always act the same, but I'm always on some different shit
Always act the same, but I'm always on some different shit
