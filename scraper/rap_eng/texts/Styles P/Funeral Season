[Intro]
Statik, wuddup?
Ghost
D-Block

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Stone cold shooter, let the heater blow
Gun that a just named Twitter, follow the leader though
Up in the hood, homie askin I got my nina on
Adjusted his eyes on some niggas that he needed gone
It’s like that regular, life ain’t normal
If you dyin' to shine then ice ain’t for you
If the sky fall then the sky can’t warn you
When your head crack the dice don’t warn you
Lightin up weed, pour that sour
In the streets in the mix like Kool Aid powder
Ride on them niggas, show em you ain’t coward
Yea you got family but you ain’t ours
Get popped up, oxed up, or boxed up
Think it’s a joke then bitch nigga then hop up
Cuz I’m Ghost and I’m still OG
This time I’m with Statik and the Trill OG, wuddup?

[Hook]
Livin rich or livin poor
Funerals stay on schedule
This not season, can’t stop the heathen
Funerals stay on schedule
All the G’s is getting money and relaxin
But funerals stay on schedule
And I don’t even care about the charges if they ain't federal
Funerals stay on schedule

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I walk the cold streets of the city with big heaters
Ready for cats, there’s no one up, they dick beaters
Yea it’s Big B, the trill OG walkin
So keep yo mouth shut when the OG talkin
If I want your opinion then nigga I’ll beat it out of you
I’m bred for the gutters bitch, I doin' what I gotta do
And that’s got a lot to do with where I was raised
Original land of the trill where they roamin with K’s
On the ground with the gauge, and they lurkin with ninas
Doing dirt to get paid, committing more than misdemeanors
What's the while the shit you see a nigga do in his life
Is the average shit
That's goin on here every night
You can go to PA, til they beam all the yonkers
The young niggas wildin in the streets, going bonkers
Best thing I could do right now is pray for you
I pass pinero the pistol nigga to lay on you, hold up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hit-Boy]
For every nigga that say he proud of me, it’s a nigga that’s out for me
Feelin like Martin Luther, I’m standin out on the balcony
Niggas used to be close but I cut em off, call em amputees
Niggas was in the van with me, only niggas advance with me
Bitches ain’t wanna fuck, now they on they knees for a chance with me
If you knew what that bass meant this is my fuckin rhapsody
Feel like I’m on Rap City, killin it with my faculty
High up off the ground, I swear I’m defying gravity
An IE youngin but when I grow up I’mma buy me something
I always knew it like the psyche bluffin
Miss Cleo of the hustle, I swear I could see the future
We got bigger guns than dreams, little niggas'll shoot ya
For no reason other than colors, he looked up to his brother
Now we layin beside him, too many tears for a mother
Too many story of hunger but fuck ya infomercial
I be out here in the streets tryna teach my niggas to come up, word

[Hook]
