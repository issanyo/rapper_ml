[Hook 2x]
Hold meee meee me down
Ohohoh OhhhhOhhhh
Hold me down
Hold me down oh oh

[Verse 1: Styles P]
God hold me down, cause Ghost ain't holdin' up
Livin' the fast life, I feel my soul slowin' up
I only think of my drinking, when I'm throwin' up
Blackin' out, actin' out, I'm waking up, the gat is out
Driving in reverse, not looking, when I'm backin' out
It's like getting on a plane with no wings
Abandoned in the land of the men, that has no kings
I hear my gun talk, I hear my Colt sing
Get the money nigga, go ahead and murder them
Fuck it, you never heard of them, imagine what I'm hurdling
I'm taking long jumps, I wonder what the Lord wants
I wanna know before they hit me with the long pump
These cock sucking niggas can't touch me
But I feel lucky, cause I hear the angels sing
When I blow the dutchie, Ayo Lucky
Fuck Life, two guns up, I let them bust twice

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Lushlife]
Ghost told me hold it down, buck em down, that's the mediation
Back home with a flow sicker than rap, I never be that free, we wastin'
All time on TV chasing, that BET or MTV dream see me waiting
Spittin' that BDP and meditating
Matter fact I still wanna poke hope, I still wanna roll with the po' folk
I don't wanna be a player, but I wanna be a rhymesayer, no joke, and I won't choke
And it won't be the feds, it won't be the friends, the moment you go and float up in the end
I make my entrance, make my exit, make that record spin
Back on my seventeen-seventy-sixin', damn right
Philly we walk with a bop and walk by on top of the land right
That's manifest destiny, had to move D and it didn't make no sense to me
I'm in the whip with a dime piece puffin on trees, do believe these extra sensorys
Yo, You lose a Dilla, you losin' a Godzilla
He's still alive on the track, and the beat play back, I heard him next to me
Catch the beat, spit that ecstasy, ever since I got put on to Extra P
Had a vision I was sittin' in a bar full of women, and they all wanna be with what's left of me

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Lushlife]
Yo, I write them rhymes to change they minds, on my records records
And I get a paycheck just to pay that rent until we stackin' cheddar
Life still ain't better man, I'm still on stage with a head wrapped bedouin
Better make a move now, when it all fall down, I be that oowop veteran
That's not so bad, not so easy to have battle rappin' a verse
But still, wanna make it easy to grab
When I be that Polo reekin', I be forever geekin', city sleepin'
Ever since '86, everything that I write is gon' be forever speakin'
Every weekend's a blur, Every night's automatic
Better off with a path through that I gotta choose, beauty all up at it
Everything we touch is gold, everything I see is bright
Everyday I'm one step closer to the end, it might as well be night
