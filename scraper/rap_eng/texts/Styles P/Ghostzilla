[Verse 1]
Godzilla, I'm the bar-killer
Seen the Devil at the car dealer, took him on a test drive
He want that body dumped on the West Side
Maybe it's the East Side, like I give a fuck where a creep die
Niggas know I'm ignorant, never had a sweet side
Only got a street side
Drink and celebrate when I hear that police died
Vegan, but I'm deep-fried
Searchin' for a icy (-) and a leather (-)
My man said I got a death wish, but I got a life wish, mike wish
Shit, I'm the illest, the center cypher, illest, the center crisis
Know I flip a bird or grab a gun on some heist shit
Name is Styles P, you can add in the hyphen
Bars so deli, they hopin' I get 'em licensed
Let me chill on you, ill on you, destroy, then rebuild on you
I'm buggin' out, they think I took a pill on you
Funky like a junky on a Benz, no syringe
All I want to know: you want to get your face on your Timbs?
Rain on your Benz
Or your guts and your liver on these bars like AIDS
And these niggas know I will give it to you
Fuck all that other shit, dap in the picture, fet the mike
Throw the beat on, I will motherfuckin' smother 'em
Now, who got the money to cover 'em?
Your ass is next right after I'm done thuggin' 'em
