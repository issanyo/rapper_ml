[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Nigga hate me or love it
Cocaine and crack rocks was my only budget
Bagged up crack wasn't mine I couldn't touch it
First whip, bought a navi, the Porsche, I couldn't touch it
Product of the streets, product of the riches
Product of seein' the hustlers with all the bitches
Product of the guns, product of the fights
Product of the ice and how it's looking in the lights
Product of the homeless, product of the beggin'
I love Obama but I'm a product of Reagan
Then I started rap
Others niggas was trying to put they foot in the door we was trying to put a leg in
Product of the pimps, product of the talk
Product of the Yankee hat, product of New York
Product of the crooked cops, product of the court
Product of my workers always coming up short
Product of the dealers, product of the feem
Product of B-I-G, product of the Queen
Product of my money nine with the beam
Product of The Lox always reppin for my team
Mother fuckas

[Chorus: L-Biz]
I got the shooters at the front door
And the car for the getaway
Dreams taking too long, still a nigga gotta get paid
See I ain't tryna hurt nobody, hurt nobody
Still I'm down to rob me a nigga or you'll see me hustle hard just to move that product
Cause I'm a product

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I'm the offspring of Debbie and Bob
Matter of fact, I'm a product of society so let me evolve
I'm the profit of the sales that you catchin' tonight
I'm a product of the residue that's left in the pipe
I'm a victim of police brutality
I'm the product of a kingpin's salary
I just got a natural born killer mentality
I guess I'm a product of Mickey and Mallory
I'm the product of the Beamers, floor model [?]
If Rich was still alive, A was workin' at the cleaners
Product of the 30H, product of the neeners
Never letting nothin' come between us
Product of the Beatles, yeah tided up in the diesel
Heroin era I'm a product of the needles
Get it right now, I got product on the block
I'm from Yonkers, New York I'm a product of the Lox
Mother fucker

[Chorus: L-Biz]
I got the shooters at the front door
And the car for the getaway
Dreams taking too long, still a nigga gotta get paid
See I ain't tryna hurt nobody, hurt nobody
Still I'm down to rob me a nigga or you'll see me hustle hard just to move that product
Cause I'm a product

[Verse 3: Styles P]
I'm a product that's moving that product
From a alcoholic pops, block full of narcotics
Dirty little niggas keep they guns in the garbage
What you had for breakfast, nothing, a porridge
I'm a product of late nights and no sleep
Life's a game and I'm sitting in the nose bleeds
I need product to produce, I could proceed
I live fast blowin' weed at a slow speed
I'm a product of county jail and group homes
I'm the boss and the killer that'll shoot for 'em
I'm the product of the villains so I root for 'em
I'm the product of the Benz, I got a coupe for 'em
I'm the product Nike Airs and Ralph Lauren
I'm the product of dope boys that's out scorin'
I'm the product of D-Block, product of The Lox
I'm the product of Jack boys that merc the whole spot
Whaddup!

[Chorus: L-Biz]
I got the shooters at the front door
And the car for the getaway
Dreams taking too long, still a nigga gotta get paid
See I ain't tryna hurt nobody, hurt nobody
Still I'm down to rob me a nigga or you'll see me hustle hard just to move that product
Cause I'm a product
