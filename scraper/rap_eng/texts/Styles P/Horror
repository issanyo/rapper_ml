[Hook - Tyler Woods]

We the bang, shoot 'em up gang
We up in the streets, see the wolves and the fangs
You can see the horror through the scope with an aim
All the real G's front line do the same

[Verse 1 - Sheek Louch]

Criminal mindstate, crack on my mom plate
Lox on that murder shit, we boost the crime rate
All black bandana, connects in Atlanta
Trayvon hoodie on, taped up banana
My nigga on that wild shit, life ain't the way he planned it
When he fought a traffic ticket, fuck around and got remanded
All I keep is cash money, stacks in the rubber band
She don't wanna fuck with him, she said he's a bird man
Now I'm on my weed shit, early morning trying to find a dutch
Letters from Valhalla, I'm trying to stay in touch
Even though I'm rich, I jump out of the car with the AR
Yo Tyler, tell him who we are

[Hook - Tyler Woods]

We the bang, shoot 'em up gang
We up in the streets, see the wolves and the fangs
You can see the horror through the scope with an aim
All the real G's front line do the same

Yeah, you wanna fuck with The LOX boy? (boy)
You better come with that Glock boy (boy)
Yeah they run with them dope boys (boys)
All the killers and gangsters boy

[Verse 2 - Styles P]
Let it bang, never will the goonery stop
The devil knocked the same time opportunity knocked
I'm sick, like I never have immunity shots
I'm in the mood to let off, who in the mood to get popped?
I'm hungry, like I ain't got no food in the pot
What I can do with this work, what I can do with the Glock
I can get the strip lit up, cause a funeral ah
Let it squeeze and feel it in my cuticles ah
Yellow M6, shit brown hoopde
You ain't that wavy, you ain't that loopy
Welcome to the fellowship, salute me or shoot me
Alpha Wolf Ghost, let it bang with the uzi

[Hook - Tyler Woods]

[Verse 3 - Jadakiss]

Silence is still golden
Salute to the niggas that blew a couple M's on nothing and still holding
Clip empty, barrel still smoking
It wasn't done right if the casket is still open
Revoked ya G pass, wake, funeral then the reed passed
Deserve a hollow tip in each knee cap
Cover in killers that just relapsed
Show up where you sleep at, eat at, believe that
Yeah, buckshot slugs in every shottie
Cause the gates ain't pearly for everybody
The horror of not being able to see the 'morrow
Is the saga of this thing of ours that we apart of

[Hook (x2) - Tyler Woods]
