[Verse 1: Kingpen Slim]
Got Jewish lawyers defending me
Unfriendly people befriending me
So I'm speakin to Satan's synergy
In the mirror lookin at my blatant enemy
I drink early
And smoke often
Got woodgrain wishes haunted by oak coffins
I see dead people with yall faces
Deliver the devil black roses in tall vases
Back from hell, to confront my demons
They imitatin' evil kinevil to stunt my dreamin'
They say what's in a name, and I say everything
Cause Barry made enough for his bond with each and every swing
Til I see better days
I'mma fuck your girl with the last fuck I ever gave
I coulda told you that I'm black hearted
I'm not wrapped to tight
Fuck a rap artist

[Hook: Kingpen Slim]
And you know if I'm in the mix it's goin' down
That's DOA
Dead

They Dead
Killin the game
They dead
You heard what I said
If I'm in the mix it's goin' down
That's DOA
Dead
Call 911
They Dead
Killin the game
They dead
You heard what I said
If I'm in the mix it's goin' down

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Yeah
That's DOA
Nigga we don't play
Cause niggas is bout the chips like Frito Lay
They could tell you what a handgun, a kilo weigh
What's the price on a ticket, what Tito say
New Jacks in the city like it's Nino day
But niggas'll handle beef the Gambino way
Yeah
That's why Paulie got killed when he was leavin' the steakhouse
Fredo got killed on the lake for the fake out(sucka)
Takin' the fake route
Somebody shoot the zookeeper lettin the snakes out(shoot em)
Cocksucker
Pigs don't run around in the city
They play the farm nigga
Tell and you losing your tongue
And your arm nigga
Thats DOA
Nigga Dead on arrival nigga P don't play
Ask Kingpen
We doin' it Carlito's way whaddup

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kingpen Slim]
Angel in a room full of devils
Stay above ground in a room full of shovels
Tip
Toe
We on pins and needles
Cause when you poppin pricks'll bring the boom to your bubble
Shoutout to my hustlers out there waitin' on the bird
Shoutout to my killers out there waitin' on the word
Word
If you wanna see me
You can always meet me in the street
I'll be waitin on the curb
Write it down in blood
Curses come in cursive
We practicin' for action and your hearse is in rehearsal
Look I got some million dollar moves that I'm mullin over
Parolees on Pirellis baby I ain't pullin over
H-N-I-C come and see me headline
I'mma need some head I'm just tellin' you ahead of time
No game Super Mario
I'll get you barred from the barrio

[Hook]
