[Chorus x2 – Bazaar Royale and (M-1)]
Soon as my comrade calls (Click clack!)
I’mma be right there, strapped up, ready for war
All for one, one for all (Get back!)
Who can you call when your back’s against the wall?

[Verse 1 – M-1 and Styles P]
[M-1]
Picture this serious situation is on and the heaters blazin’
And you gettin’ burnt by the shells.  Patience
It’s obvious that it’s war that you engage in
Not the Middle East invasion—hood banging like the pigs is being laid dead
You barricadin’ and the doors almost cavin’ in
Got the bravest men, but still, the look on every face is grim
It’s ride or die, a hard place and a rock
So I call on the General, SP, and the D-block
It’s Code Three
[Styles P]
Who that is, RBG?
[M-1]
Hell muthafuckin’ yeah
[Styles P]
Who’s poppin’ my family?
[M-1]
I got my back against the wall
Chase Bank in Times Square
I’m surrounded by the boys
[Styles P]
Son, I’m almost there
I’m a couple of blocks away
With a couple of Glocks to spray
A AK and the bomb and a shottie I copped today
I’m a revolutionist.  I’m a executionist
My comrade call, I’ll be the first one shootin’ shit

[Chorus x2 – Bazaar Royale and (M-1)]
Soon as my comrade calls (Click clack!)
I’mma be right there, strapped up, ready for war
All for one, one for all (Get back!)
Who can you call when your back’s against the wall?

[Verse 2 – M-1 and Styles P]
[Styles P]
Calling M-1.  Could you give me anyone?
Surrounded by some niggas, mo’ niggas, and then some
Bullet ricochetin’ off the walls and the furniture
I can feel the heat and I ain’t turn the furnace up
Might be the government, might be the industry cinema
Some niggas that was thuggin’ it, I don’t really know, nigga
[M-1]
But don’t you worry, ‘cause I’m coming through the door, nigga
[Styles P]
Looking like a war
[M-1]
And I’m coming with some more niggas
[Styles P]
Waitin’ from a comrade to come with a bomb bag
I’mma set it off—when you see it, I’m on track
Get ready for the revolution
RBG and that’s P
Muthafucka, we can have the whole ghetto street
[M-1]
It’s the people against the pigs
We splittin’ these crackers’ wigs
You gettin’ it how you live
Overstand, underdig
You know how we did it
‘Cause they keep pushin’ us to the limit
This ain’t no gimmick
If you my ‘rade, I’m all in it, nigga

[Chorus x2 – Bazaar Royale and (M-1)]
Soon as my comrade calls (Click clack!)
I’mma be right there, strapped up, ready for war
All for one, one for all (Get back!)
Who can you call when your back’s against the wall?
