Shit
You always are lookin’ at the people
The projects, the buildings get the wrong niggas in
Torn the seat up
Hoping I don’t have to flush it
Brown nigga pocked full of big bills
You’re not turning into a preach nigga
You still let the hammer off
Higher than the motherfucker
You ain’t after her no more
I might have to fuck her
I’m starting in the morning, nigga
But you wasn’t really mine, nigga
I ain’t trippin’ ,I hate you ’re comin’ with the teritory
Yeah, I put the niggas on the ground
I ain’t trippin’ ,I hate you ’re comin’ with the teritory
Yeah, I put the niggas on the ground
And you will burry them for me
Nobody could cover for me
I used to get money, that’s another story
My heart pours out fort those who suffer before me
As long as it ain’t broken, wtf do you call me?
Bitches love it
They see you jumpin’ in different machines
Sunday to Sunday I’m training and I’m being ready
I came from the hood and I’m on the runway
You know the ticket is one –way
I’m probably lookin’ for action
The shit is loaded in fragments
I ain’t got …
Give me a reason or a point to why I’m leavin’
You are already fucking
If you don’t know, then find out
Fuck off ,sucker
