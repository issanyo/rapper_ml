[Intro: Nino Man]
Nino Man
We're just about ready

[Verse 1: Nino Man]
I had to get it on my own 'cause this culture is petty
Niggas see you gettin' fine, these vulture be ready
Sick and tired of ravioli, I want the spaghetti
I got tired of buyin' my mother groceries with pennies
It was days I was down on my last, I had twenty-eight cash and bought me a gram
I made ninety cash fast 'fore it got out of hand
To make a long story, they called me the man
I chased the money 'cause these bars is iffy
So if you ever see me chasin', bitch, somebody tripped me
You better try  that wit' that nigga, please don't try that wit' me
'Cause he a corn with some bread, you should call him jiffy

[Chorus: Nino Man]
Let them niggas hate
We don't even know them niggas, let them niggas hate
Wait-wait
Let them niggas hate
We don't even know them niggas, let them niggas hate
Wait

[Verse 2: Styles P]
We don't even know them niggas, let them niggas hate
We just skatin' wit' this money, fuck a figure eight
If they hear you got weight, they in a nigga place
Bust a eight at your family for a nigga safe
They ain't even sure if it's got cash in it
The J got the hash in it
The van got the forceful task in it
New York is a fast minute, do shit in the last minute
He ain't ready for war, his mouth got his ass in it
Why they hatin'? We don't even know 'em
Send a pretty bitch to blow 'em then we really  show 'em
'Cause he ain't got his gun and his pants down
Tie him up, put honey on his body, lay an army of ants down
Ghost

[Chorus: Nino Man]
Let them niggas hate
We don't even know them niggas, let them niggas hate
Wait-wait
Let them niggas hate
We don't even know them niggas, let them niggas hate
Wait

[Outro]
We're just about ready
