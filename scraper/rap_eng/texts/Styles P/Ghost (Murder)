[Intro]
Ghost, D-Block, LOX, nigga

[Verse 1]
Think about your life when I'm contemplatin' your death
Shiftin' with my right hand, steerin' with my left
Weirdo, knockin' off your earrings with my TEC
And your ears too, why the fuck you think I'm tryin' to hear you?
Me verse the day I'm expectin' to kill a bear too
All I see is blood, even when I got a clear view
That's what life do, read sun tzu in high school
And that was for night view, let's talk about it
Nah, I'd rather not, nine in your chatterbox
I could take the ox and open your Adam's apples
Ox, chill Ghost, nah, P, (-)
He gon' put this head under the tire of his Maserati
And then go for a nice ride
You don't like me, I hope you know that it's likewise
Better have a gun that sound like the (-)
Howard, you a coward, you better get you a lifeline
Have a real nigga bowed for you?
Better check the bushes cause a real nigga crowd for you
What's your life worth?
Why don't you name the amount for you?
You couldn't pay me not to kill you
Black Label, Rolexes, Mercedes at the venue
At the crib, hopin' his lady's at the window
He's the food, but we only waiters to get the menu
Life a diesel, prepare to see evil, you know men do
They say greed'll get you killed
You up the bat now, but don't bleed in the film
I'm comin' throw low, blowin' weed at the wheel
Bob and weave, known to leave, get the bees in jail
LOX, holiday, hollow-tip, homicide
Had to do it, tellin' my homie go get the hideaway
If you got beef, I kill you right away
Bullets is lighter-sized, you'd never see a brighter day, nigga
