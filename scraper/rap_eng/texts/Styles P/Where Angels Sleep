[Verse 1: Styles P]
Life is gettin' way too deep
When I die, I wanna go where the angels sleep
Yeah, I'm outside tryna make ends meet
My mens ten deep in the Range and Benz jeeps
They in-route too, niggers'll shoot you, it's crucial
Ain't Marley Marl but I'm part of the new Juice Crew
Brass in the bark of the dutch in the deuce deuce
Spit on a nuke to get loot, I'm the shit, dude
Niggas'll dog you like Pitbull, a Shih Tzu
Right arm up, and a fist is gettin' clenched too
Give 'em a inch and them niggas'll take a mile on you
Father they style and them niggas'll try to Style on you
But not me nigga, Amma Cafie nigga, can't pop me nigga
I always come with a good plan
And if that don't work, I switch out to the hood plan

[Chorus]
Jah be like a long cloth to my feet
Guide and protect me when things get deep
Even though the streets full of heat
Still I gotta make ends meet
Jah be like a long cloth to my feet
Guide and protect me when things get deep
I pray that my soul you keep
'Cause me wa fi to dwell where the angel's sleep

[Verse 2: Styles P]
God is protection, X is intersections
Trunk full of weight in the Chevy, holding the Wesson
Fire will burn but we never would learn a lesson
'Til the cell door close, move more keys
And we sell more O's and bag more grams
We ain't wanna be criminals, we had more plans
But it ain't pan out
It's rocks in this pot that I gotta hand out as soon as they fan out
That's the old days, these the new days
Now it's Salvia, kush, lemon and Poo day
High def, Wi-Fi, clear as Blu-ray
But I'm still old school like the hangin' antenna
You could play with the fam or bang your bandana
S-P the Ghost or S-P the most
Lyrical motherfucka in the game, no jokes
.45 will leave your ass high, no smoke

[Chorus]
Jah be like a long cloth to my feet
Guide and protect me when things get deep
Even though the streets full of heat
Still I gotta make ends meet
Jah be like a long cloth to my feet
Guide and protect me when things get deep
I pray that my soul you keep
'Cause me wa fi to dwell where the angel's sleep
