[Intro]
Just tryin' to give you this gangsta shit, my niggas
You know? Right

[Verse 1]
If it's love or it's war, it's all fair
I been to funerals with niggas that don't care
Thinkin' 'bout the money and knowin' it's all there
Why he in the circle? You know that he won't share
Niggas die in law, you know that that's all rare
Not a gun but a knife, if it's life, you gon' spare
But leave a long scar, so niggas'll show fear
But how much will you make at the end of the year?
No more struggle, we all bubble
You a player, but you ain't the type to call a huddle
I'm a gangsta cause I'm cool, but most of all subtle
History and violence ain't lookin' for more trouble
Got 'em loaded up and you know that they all muzzle
Get it figured out and start lookin' for more puzzles
Five different hustles, I'm keepin' them all juggled
Comin' through in Polo, I'm solo holdin' a duffle
The lick came sweet, I blew an L and I chuckled
Thinkin' of the days when I had to bloody my knuckles
Everybody is gettin' murked now
Hard bossin' up when you can't put the work down
Meet the law, but I won't go to church now
Or to play the Milds, but it's close to the first now
You thinkin' of the touchdown, I'm thinkin' of the first down
The Glock don't box, you get killed with the first round
Think I'm lyin' to swing iron
Your heart pump different when a body part flyin'
Word up, I can nerd up
I set a purge up and have niggas go tear the 'burbs up
Shout to the dealin' niggas that served us
Me on the beat is like Greece verse Persia
It's a surplus of murder
I need a few feet, then a few more
You should have turned your truck to a two-door
I don't give a fuck about your crew or your shooter
Or your shooters, sum it up, two words: fuck you
Ghost back, you don't want your crew hurt
I did old dirt, what's new dirt?
Keep talkin' shit, I pop up where your boo work, nigga
