[Hook - Reks]
This evolution of revolution will not be televised
Hard to decide if you were right
Die, die, shed tears but why cry? It's all gone
Soldiers no longer soldiers, ghettos no longer ghettos
Prisons still tryna hold us
Rebels, where are the rebels? They all gone
Shed tears but why cry, still strong

[Verse 1 - Reks]
Yeah, ghetto misery, over alchemist symphonies
One third of century just ain't making no sense to me
Sending me to cells where hell's real, get name killed
Body for a dollar and who we power and lust
Cowards bust, when coward dust, chop it up to the game
Illegal life cops is living the same
Rest in peace, to Timmy went through his brains
Sorry for your mamma's pain, R-E-King-Supreme
Remember fiends and dreams of good life
Not talking, yeezy whips and chains, living grizzy
Not cus we greedy but needy, man
My city stains my memory
Visions of remains like the "break your ankle" game
Brother get brother, yeah, I'm talking
Able Cain for the paper bane
Hate on your name, pawn in the palm of the system, man
Spit a pawn if you get on nigga swing
You change pass on back
If your name don't crack, niggas is lame

[Hook - Reks]
This evolution of revolution will not be televised
Hard to decide if you were right
Die, die, shed tears but why cry? It's all gone
Soldiers no longer soldiers, ghettos no longer ghettos
Prisons still tryna hold us
Rebels, where are the rebels? They all gone
Shed tears but why cry, still strong

[Verse 2 - Styles P]
The evolution of revolution revolting
Me, I'm more alive but the 45 is colting
No religion get treated like assaulting
You can fuck around and your face will get molten
Little niggas is different, they got me tripping cause
They don't know tradition or they don't know addition just
New clothes but they know the limited edition of a new whip
New ship, that's why I throw to deuces
On my Nas shit, I could smoke with Medusa
Ain't a nigga tighter, but ain't a nigga looser
I'm the rebel at rye die, true blue true nigga
I don't change colors like tie dye, soldier
The high guy telling you bye, bye load up
And let it fly nigga then why cry
Big shouts to my nigga Reks bring static
Like Statik until I get a bigger cheque

[Hook - Reks]
This evolution of revolution will not be televised
Hard to decide if you were right
Die, die, shed tears but why cry? It's all gone
Soldiers no longer soldiers, ghettos no longer ghettos
Prisons still tryna hold us
Rebels, where are the rebels? They all gone
Shed tears but why cry, still strong

I be where the monsters at, I be where the monsters at
I be where the monsters at, I be where the monsters at
