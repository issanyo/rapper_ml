[Intro: Styles P]
You know what it is
That extra high shit, you know
Sometimes you just zone the fuck out
That's how it be

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Took a drink, lit a joint
Hit too much wax, am I off point?
[?] in the six, knockin'
Renee remix by the Lost Boyz
You felt pain if you lost joy
Can't please a wolf with a dog's toy
You got beef, bring it to the source, boy
When Achilles killed Hector, he lost Troy
You're forewarned 'bout the four pound
Catch a 'em in a four by four, give 'em four rounds
That was five fours but it wasn't a dub
I was out there for the money if it wasn't the love
On-site every night, that's the life of a thug
Ran up every day gettin' tight with the plug
If we all livin' wrong, am I rightfully bugged?
Get the lighter, I got fire, I'm about to get buzzed
It's inhaled then it's held in
If I ain't goin' to Heaven, I go to Hell
Then think about the black cloud, wonderin' if I fell in
Am I Heaven sent or Hell bent?
I be outside on the South side
Come through the North side in a boss ride
Shout to the West and the East side
We gon' get high and pray to God that the beast die

[Chorus: Snyp Life]
Yeah, I'm always on some other shit, rubber grips
Load up the fifth for another vic'
On the float gettin' high to the roach clips
Oh shit, telly port style when I smoke shit
Yeah, I'm always on some other shit, rubber grips
Load up the fifth for another vic'
On the float gettin' high to the roach clips
Oh shit, telly port style when I smoke shit

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Can't remember the beginnin' but you think of the end
If I'm higher than the cloud, can I sleep on the wind?
Can God cleanse my soul with the rain drops?
I don't go to church, will it work, will the pain stop?
Used to blow weed, get the money out the 'caine spot
If you from the ghetto, you probably done heard a thang pop
Seen it jump, it ain't stop, can't stop, won't stop
That was three stops but we keep goin'
I like to smoke, I pre-roll 'em
The lab life, I keep flowin'
Bruce P-Roy, I keep glowin'
One mic check, four night checks
Precise and hype if you don't know that I'm nice yet
All black hoppin' out the white 'Vet
I got the insight and my sight's set

[Chorus: Snyp Life]
Yeah, I'm always on some other shit, rubber grips
Load up the fifth for another vic'
On the float gettin' high to the roach clips
Oh shit, telly port style when I smoke shit
