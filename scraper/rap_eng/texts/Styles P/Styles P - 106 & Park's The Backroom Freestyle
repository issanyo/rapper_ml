[Intro]
BET 106 & Park
This is the Backroom
I am technician and D.J
And right now I got
The world's hottest MC
Hold it now, D block LOX
Styles P
Ready?
Lets get em
1, 2, 3, go!

[Verse: Styles P]
Everybody turned up, me I'm just burned up
Sour lit, piff lit, flying through the district
My swag's in the weed bag
Live up in the hotel, hangout where the G's at
Where the B's and the C's at?
You fall back, or you ease back
But a real homie'll rise up
Think of the 4-4 long, you got me sized up
I'm too old for the dumb shh-
Cold for the numb shh-
Hand on the gun grip
The top down with the blunt lit
Flying, thinking of hundreds
I'm in the juice game and the book game
But I'm still rapping, got my mass and my cook game
It's midnight but we 730
We legit, but forever dirty!
So even if I'm thin, G
That old sweatsuit, got a pocket full of them Benjies
I want a goose neck in the benzie
Still feel the pain from the cocaine frenzy
80s, 90s and 2Gs, knew I was too G, listened to Kool G!
No gun or knife then I'm throwing the two piece
Cop me a new pair of kicks if my shoes crease
Lines and holes, just like a loose leaf
Dope lines, bullet holes, homie, is you sleep?
Yeah, you better wake up then, you ain't gettin it
Get a job, cake up then!
If the nine don't work, throw the eight up then
I'm a crooked dude, but I'mma tell you straight up then
Yeah, we both rap but you know that the ghost trap
Backroom! from the backroom! with the dope track, big
