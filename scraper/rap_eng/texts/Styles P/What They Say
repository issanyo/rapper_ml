[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
The cloth I’m cut from is a million of y’all
They will teach that you can achieve if you go hard
Your lifestyle need a tape put it on paper
In the days of the rock I redefine 40 acres
I’mma collect a check for every disrespect
And I spell it with a kill, the pres’ of intellect
Is who I been for too long but nobody moving
Early hall-of-famer every punchline’s proven
Shoes crush grooving pants a beach tree
My shirts the harder they come I was taught to be it
And if they don’t see it then hold they eyes open
Anyone after me might still smoke it
Heavyweights choking, feds with cold feet
The difference between us is debts and gold teeth
The difference between us is bets that don’t breech
And speech that really hopes your best will not leak
Come on

[Hook: Lil Fame]
Another day up in the street life
This what every day up in the streets like
Fuck them cameras on the streetlights
Check out the heat like
Yo, this is the life (that’s what they say)
Yo, this is the life (that’s what they say)
Yo, this is the life (that’s what they say)
Yo, this is the life

[Verse 2: Lil Fame]
Yo it’s the fame and the glory
Half Yankey, half Trini I’m a [?]
And I pop my burner
[?] from ground zero back to Port of Spain, [Laverty Hill?]
I done been through a lot of shit
Lived through a lot of shit
You was an infant suckin’ on your momma tits
All of a sudden you a G talkin’ drama shit
Kill the bullshit, you ain’t that kind of kid
You hoping the situations had executions [?]
On muthafuckas we won’t stop shooting til we empty
Everybody just pray
That’s fucked up cause the wild man ain’t comin’ round
Til about 3 the next day
And the body just lay with a white sheet on him
The heat of the [?], man look at the steam on him
Rude boy business from Brook-norm to T dot
It’s gat, gat, gat muthafucka

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
This is the life that’s what they say
Handguns and AKs is what they spray
Niggas give you the finger like it’s fuck you day
Hear the whispers niggas like “what the fuck you say?”
That’s how it is in the street right
Hold your heat tight
Split him to the white meat, he gon’ go to sleep right
Fuck him he ain’t getting up
Type of nigga I spit on him then stick him up
Disrespectful, get a chest full of neck full
Guy named yoga, it’ll stretch you
I’m a dog and you pet food
Hit ‘em with a bullet he bloody, now he wet food
This is the life that’s what they say
This is the life what the fuck you heard?
Me and you got beef, I’mma buck you first
Could have said fuck me but it was fuck you first

[Hook]

[Outro: Bob and Doug McKenzie]
Hold on, I’m drawing something
(What?)
It’s a picture of you
(Don’t draw me)
It’s a picture of a knob – I drew a knob, he’s a knob
(Boy, I’m talking to nobody – play the song)
