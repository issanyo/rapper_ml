[Intro]
The number 7 is the seeker, the thinker, the searcher of truth. The Seven doesn't take anything at face value, it is always trying to understand the underlying hidden truth. The Seven knows that nothing is exactly as it seems and that reality is often hidden behind illusions

[Post-Intro: Talib Kweli & Styles P]
Yeah
That Kweli ghost shit right here
And I ready
Get your bars up, nigga
Let the games begin
7

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Welcome to the conscience of the nation on hard beats
I rap to my heart beat
Keepin' time as my feet hit the concrete
These dark streets blacker than the color of charred beef
The dark meat falling off like the flesh of a zombie
This freedom, that they dangle in front of us like some car keys
Snatch it back and peel out like a car thief
I'm sharper than shark's teeth
They prayin' cause the bars is godly
I'm a black star like Marcus Garvey
I'm rocking with Styles P, the ghost
'Cause most these rappers is mouthy
Firewater got them feening like alkies
The streets need a mouthpiece
My niggas is just trying to live
No I ain't talkin' Sundays on South Beach
I'm talkin' some days the fridge is empty as the shelves in Bodegas that only sell weed, coke and cigars with the flavors
As far as the neighbors, we at each others throats for the paper
The government gangster so people put they hope in a savior, nope

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
Now that's that shit that you ain't know that you need
The gangstas and the poets, yeah we know what it be
Plantin' these fields of reality, we sowin' the seeds
There's no games like Atari, cause we not playin' with niggas
Now that's that shit that you ain't know that you need
Grow somethin', smoke somethin' cause we rolling the trees
I got the ghost as a quarterback, he throw it to me
It's no games like Serani, cause we not playin' with niggas

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Wanna chat with ghost fuck a Ouija
Only board you need is the engineer's
Armageddon and Venom here
Lyrical warfare dies if you send 'em here
MC graveyard the lyrical pallbearer [?]
If I'm there I bet you the Lord hear us
Or maybe the angels, maybe a few demons
Channel my ancestors when doing my deep breathin'
The light from the darkness giving the mic spark
With deep soul, deep brain wave and an ice heart
Get the weed in the paper and watch how the flight start but
You should get away if ever the fight start
One love but first blood drawer to get it drawn from me
They gon' throw the peace sign but bet you they put the horns to me
Yeah I drop science of writing in Orion
On the ride with God but he letting me co-pilot
Jet until I die if you ever to profile him

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
Now that's that shit that you ain't know that you need
The gangstas and the poets, yeah we know what it be
Plantin' these fields of reality, we sowin' the seeds
There's no games like Atari, cause we not playin' with niggas
Now that's that shit that you ain't know that you need
Grow somethin', smoke somethin' cause we rolling the trees
I got the ghost as a quarterback, he throw it to me
It's no games like Serani, cause we not playin' with niggas

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
(Niggas) sell their souls to Mephistopheles
Fuck the fourth estate, cause the devil got a monopoly
Egyptology the philosophy, fuck Socrates
How you, possibly stoppin' me when you flow so sloppily?
Rappers, try to copy me just to prove they a man to me
Just a fan to me, standin' right under the Kweli canopy
(it's nice here)
Protected from ego and vanity
These culture vultures claim they like rap but be acting like Sean Hannity understanding me?

[Verse 4: Styles P]
Architect the anarchy, insanity
Humble but I'm feignin' in vanity
Pain bringer to families
That boy is a rapper, he dead
Understanding me?
Protocol call all the pros that be flowin'
I'll embarrass them
Rollin' down my lane like a bowling ball
No-one know nothin', still in awe, I'm a know-it-all
Know I kill these rappers, fuck if I know 'em y'all
Ghost and Kweli this is MC glowing y'all

[Hook: Talib Kweli]
Now that's that shit that you ain't know that you need
The gangstas and the poets, yeah we know what it be
Plantin' these fields of reality, we sowin' the seeds
There's no games like Atari, cause we not playin' with niggas
Now that's that shit that you ain't know that you need
Grow somethin', smoke somethin' cause we rolling the trees
I got the ghost as a quarterback, he throw it to me
It's no games like Serani, cause we not playin' with niggas
