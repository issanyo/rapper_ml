[Hook: Domo Genesis]
The weed got me thinking shit that I shouldn't think
I'm tryna see what's next, I won't fucking blink
Honestly maybe I could be overthinking
Feel like the world against me, I know when it's sink or swim
If I'm stuck on this island, baby you know I'm leaping off the deep end, deep end aye

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Fuck it, sleep when I'm dead
Keep low and believe this vision
We share this world but I need it, I guess we see it different
I'm taking all and giving none, I don't need permission
As far as foes don't feel we need to mention
We started pitching from the mound and made a mountain out the mole hill
With soul cause most niggas get on and mine be broke still
I don't feel, it's like I went numb
My future bright so I don't blind when trying to look in the sun
Or maybe its' the high fresh off the blunt
Feel like the one
Feel alive when you smellin' the smoke you die by the gun
Like fuck it cause you only live once
We been knocking at this door
I'm trying to see the ceiling familiar with living on the floor
To my niggas we with it, kill and get rich on one accord
On the phone with my uncle to remind what we did it for
We locked in, now the whole shit in a figure four
We gon' get whatever shit in store
Sorry for cussing

[Verse 2: Styles P]
These the last days, even the wicked pray
Anticipate the high before I hit the J
Talking to the sky, hoping it talk back
I done drove through hell, ready to walk back
You stunting on broke niggas, get off that
I'm the lone wolf from the lost pack
The weed got me thinking what I shouldn't think
Like the world move fast and I shouldn't blink
But I wouldn't light the weed if it wasn't dank
Cause then it would be dirt to me
I got homies with hammers under they shirt for me
Wouldn't let 'em put in the work for me
Merk niggas by myself that's getting merked for me
I'm just tryna see a cloud cause
I think bud was around bloods
You said it was family, you around love if not
[?] round gloves, deuce
