Light it! Light it!
Light it! Light it!
Light it! Light it!
Light it! Light it!
Put it in the air
Light it!
Light it up in here
Light it!
Put it in the air
Light it!
Light it up in here
Light it!

Turned up, turned out
Burned up, burned out
OG kush and some girl scout
Cookies to turn my fuckin world up
Sour diesel, cat piss aids
So high I'm gone, I'll be back in days
Light one, light two
Keep lighting up if you like to
I'm so high, I'll make a weed cloud Skype you
Mary Jane is that shit
Take it to the face of the brain with that spliff
Addicted to the loud, I'm insane with that shit

Say fuck that, say fuck that
Say fuckin it
Say fuck that
Say fuck that, say fuck that
Say fuckin it
Say fuck that

[Chorus]
Fuck that, I need weed (light it!)
Fuck that, I need weed (light it!)
Fuck that, I need weed (light it!)
Fuck that, I need weed (light it!)

Stoner, loner
Tell yo girl to bite the boner
Woke up out of the kush coma
Like it's was up next
Hell yea I rap nice, it's racks on deck
Hit the bay and go dumb
New York to get a guy, West Coast Lungs
I always look for the angle
The weed is right, this is from the City of Angels
I need it, believe it
If I ain't high then I'm heated
But I'm real cool when I'm weeded

Say fuck that, say fuck that
Say fuck that, say fuck that
Say fuck that, say fuck that
Say fuck that, say fuck that

[Chorus]
Fuck that, light that
Police come, put it out and light it right back
You got a lighter use a strike match
I rose up, I twist up
I don't give a fuck, I light my shit up
I love weed, I need weed
My blood breathe, I probably bleed weed
Fuck yea, I'll probably breathe weed
Proud head and I'm proud of it
In the loudest let til I'm out of it
Then I find more smoke til I'm out of it
Styles be the ghost, Cloud 9 with it

Say fuck that, say fuck that
Say fuck that, say fuck that
Say fuck that, say fuck that
Say fuck that, say fuck that

[Chorus: x2]
Oh, man I live to get high with some weed
Oh, man I live to get high with some weed
