[Intro: Styles P]
I was always told stand for something or fall for anything
So I stand for what I believe in
Because if I don't, then I will feel like a coward at the end of the day
Um, I feel there's a point you, as a man as a woman as a human being
If you believe in something you gotta say what you believe in
If you're passionate about it you' should always stand up for it
And that's what life's about
Standing up for what you believe in
That's why I push juice, I push health, I push peace
Even tough I'm a gangster rapper cuz thats what I believe in
And that's what I stand for
And whoever don't fuck with that I just fuck 'em cuz that's how I live
Stand for what you believe [?] up

[Verse 1: KXNG Crooked]
Stand for what you believe in my nigga
Death to whoever don't want us grieving my nigga
Two wrongs don't make a right but it make a season my nigga
So even if they kill me my message is reaching my niggas
They've been this way since America's first independence day
They've been trying to kill us
I'm just writing like Hemingway
Lines that get flagged by the NSA
Not to mention racial tension is thicker
Than mixing Tokyo fisting with Janice Shay
Ignore that divine copy format
Imagine a life form that's treated worse than a doormat
Lower class whites who think you better than poor blacks
Rich whites calling you trailer trash, thats more fat
You mad good, I ain't here to comfort niggas
I'm here to expose a system designed to come for niggas
I hope you're pissed, raise you arm, close your fist
'Till we all can coexist without the fucking bumper stickers

[Chorus: Emanny]
Open up your eyes, see what I see
How could you be blind to our needs?
And it's all be designed just to push you aside
If you allow where he keeps struggling for the simple things
If that ain't enough then what will it take to stand up, up?

[Verse 2: KXNG Crooked]
Black girl get kidnapped without no amber alert
Nobody gives a damn they're rescuing animal first
Since she landed on this scandalous path of dirt
A pervert named Uncle Sam been jamming his damn hand up her skirt
I stand up cuz I'm a guardian protection
Even against you bitch niggas on Twitter
Shitting on her for her darker complexion
And these R n B artists who boycotting chocolate models
It's hard to respect them lets start to correct them
Crooked too real, they hate it when I come around
Crooked too ill, cut 'em a check make 'em dumb it down
If he don't dumb it down block him and keep him underground
My message is the exorcist's devil's heads gets spun a round
Political prisoner's sentenced for life
Because they got influence to make niggas unite
I think about Pac in a penitentiory reading Madonna's letters
While you so called real niggas never sent him a kite
We gotta do better not in the future this shit can happen now
I'm talking real peace treaties between the black and brown
I'm talking trading 'em hand cuffs for the cap and gown
I'm talking standing the fuck up instead of backing down

[Interlude]
Ladies and Gentlemen
We are gathered here tonight with every pillar under the sun
United as one
But I wanna know one thing
How come we can't stay united
When the music stops

[Chorus: Emanny]
Open up your eyes, see what I see
How could you be blind to our needs?
And it's all be designed just to push you aside
If you allow where he keeps struggling for the simple things
If that ain't enough then what will it take to stand up, up?
