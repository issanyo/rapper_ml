[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
They lovin' how the cut so premium
They vegan but its 35% more meaty
Jamla is the squad, Javotti and W.A.R. Media
The industry is greedy
And making it more tedious
For me to just get the shit
Directly to the fans
After the show
I put it directly in your hands
[?]
Yo, they love to say we back again
These half ass rappers be cheating
Like Ashley Madison (Yeah)
That's why we hacking em'
Lemme ask, It's impossible to be anonymous
When the presence in the mark is so dominant?
(Fuck society)
Mr. Robot, voice of the apocalypse
The rapper with the golden esophagus
I tower like an obelisk
Egyptian symbologist try to follow it
My words'll paint pictures
My hieroglyphics are hardest script
To read
MC's believe in passin' the buck
I give em lashes with my African tongue
Come on!

[Chorus: Little Vic]
Teleprompters telling lies, broadcasting live
Helicopters in the sky, oh God
Tell the coppers not to lie
They gon' lie, they gon' lie
Fell on top of us, we don't die, we don't die

[Verse 2: Common]
We um, we um
We um, we um, we um
Come from where niggas know drums
Beat downs
Cops on beats
Beats from Jeeps
Street sounds
Playing for keeps
It's the way we impeach
Dead presidents, yo
Print your money out
Nigga had paper
So we took the money route
Sheets get rolled up like housekeepers
My guy don't leave the house
Without reefer
Eager for the evening
The night is like breathing
We do wrong for all the right reasons
I'm fresh like I'm teething
Take a bite of the apple
Wear my heart on my sleeve like a tattoo
Hold the torch like a statue
Of liberation
Ain't no limitations
This is generation woo
The smell of new
Up in this bitch
We in this bitch
The fever pitch
Of the seasoned and rich
The infamous

[Chorus: Little Vic]
Teleprompters telling lies, broadcasting live
Helicopters in the sky, Oh God
Tell the coppers not to lie
They gon' lie, they gon' lie
Fell on top of us, we don't die, we don't die

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Emphasize on enterprise
Contribute to genocide
What you know about greed?
So I get to weedin' in the beach
Trying to reach my ancestors with my speech
To leave something with my seeds
We be on the corner like a stop sign
I ain't scared to pop mine
But I take account for my deeds
One time I didn't
And they say that it's written
But niggas'll never know
If they don't take time to read
The jewels don't glitter on the page
Told the demons shoot the fade
Full of rage but I move with such ease
I ain't full of poison
My vibration is up
Devastating the white noise
While blazing em up
I'm peaceful
I pray to the East too
North, South and West
'Cause I know what the streets do
Know what police do
If you ain't got the vision you see through
They'll leave you in the water like seafood
I'm Sifu

[Chorus]
Teleprompters telling lies, broadcasting live
Helicopters in disguise, Oh God
Tell the coppers not to lie
They gon' lie, they gon' lie
Fell on top of us, we don't die, we don't die
