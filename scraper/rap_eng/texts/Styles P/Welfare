[Verse 1: Styles P]
Fuck you and fuck all them
If you don't like me then load up and bust off then
That was me like a dime ago, now I'm cool my nigga
Learned all of the places his baby mama go
A bullet in blood is all that I'ma know
Kill all these niggas is all the drama know
Me? I throw the peace sign, violate my nigga
I shoot everything up, even the street sign
Welfare, section eight, fuck that shit
It feel good headin' to the loft clutchin' fifth
Where I'm from your insurance policy is your gun and the coke pack
Never go to sleep where they woke at
Walk in your sleep or talk in your sleep
Me? I rhyme and run and get it off in the streets
What would an angel offer a beast?
I'm hopin' death in the form of a song that is deep
Ghost

[Chorus: Whispers]
I grew up on welfare, starved
Sugar water, syrup sandwiches, just to eat (just to eat)
I never had healthcare, naww
Just a pistol on the waist for the beef (load up)
Naw, nigga you can't stop me, no (can't stop it, no)
If it's a war then you gotta go (gotta go)
Bet I pull up to your block, hang that shit right out the window yelling, "blagh blagh", adiós!

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Couple niggas wanna body Ghost
Catch that ass slippin' let it ring then its adiós
Yellin' capicu playing Dominos
With the cartels deep down in el barrio
That mo rental had Montego though
Now he sellin' juice independent but he major though
Don't you ever try to play him though
Your body's like a song that he can't wait to lay it though
Hand guns and rifles in the mix
When your cypher got the shit and them others niggas don't
Then you gotta do shit that them others niggas won't
Yeah, it's trifle in the mix you and your brother on the hunt
Pray to God they get home
If the Feds in the city, we switch phones
Niggas hit up the lab and spit poems
Nigga, we gettin' wealthy and gettin' stoned
Ghost

[Chorus: Whispers]
I grew up on welfare, starved
Sugar water, syrup sandwiches, just to eat (just to eat)
I never had healthcare, naww
Just a pistol on the waist for the beef (load up)
Naw, nigga you can't stop me, no (can't stop it, no)
If it's a war then you gotta go (gotta go)
Bet I pull up to your block, hang that shit right out the window yelling, "blagh blagh", adiós!

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Sugar water and a syrup sandwich
A little bullet gain a big advantage
Yeah, I'm black but my nigga Spanish
We gon' do damage catch the lick then we tryna' vanish
Downtown I'm a heavy swinger
My gun go, "blagh blagh," like a Reggae singer
That joint heavy in the Chevy but you bet I bring her
There's gon' be a lot of blood, bring a set of cleaners
Known in Mecha, Medina, and Medellín, An O.G. known all over the globe
They say life is a gamble but you ain't bet a thing
You said you goin' to war but you ain't dead a thing
Yeah, I been to jail but  never said a thing
Ghost

[Chorus: Whispers]
I grew up on welfare, starved
Sugar water, syrup sandwiches, just to eat (just to eat)
I never had healthcare, naww
Just a pistol on the waist for the beef (load up)
Naw, nigga you can't stop me, no (can't stop it, no)
If it's a war then you gotta go (gotta go)
Bet I pull up to your block, hang that shit right out the window yelling, "blagh blagh", adiós!
