[Intro: Jadakiss]
Can you say New York City?
Can you say L-O-L-O-L-O-X?
U-Neek!
L-O-L-O-L-O-X (can you say New York City?)
On the beat
L-O-X, L-O-X, L-O-X, L-O-X

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
'Caine slangin', chain hangin', gang bangin'
Twenty some-odd years, nigga, your name rangin'
Just look at the ratio, all the lames winnin'
Still gettin' felatio from the same women
That real underground shit that they ain't spinnin'
If he wasn't born with it, did you see it in 'em?
Looks somethin' like food but it ain't dinner
It'll get you light-headed like paint thinner
Only time she wit'chu is when I ain't in her
You a crooked loser, I'm a straight winner
Real sour, straight piffin, perk thirties
You could clean the money up but the work's dirty

[Chorus]
Big, big champagne and Moet
You gon' party 'til you sweat
The moneys yours to get
Big, big champagne and Moet
You gon' party 'til you sweat
The moneys yours to get

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Lil' young nigga, gold chain, thinkin' he fly
Passenger seat, fats had the G-T-I
I'm trying to catch the last movie at Bay Plaza
Burner on my waist, dime bags in the Dutch Master
Alhamdulillah, the grace of God we got home good
It's real, straight bullets pop off in the hood
Mr. Magic on, Sergio jacket
Yeah, we wore shiny suits but that put us in a new tax bracket
Now I'm looking through my Gucci glasses
Throwin' dollar bills at strippers with injected asses
Buncha shooters with us, chain hangin' down to the ground
The streets really know who holdin' the crown

[Chorus]
Big, big champagne and Moet
You gon' party 'til you sweat
The moneys yours to get
Big, big champagne and Moet
You gon' party 'til you sweat
The moneys yours to get

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Cocaine dealers outta play, it's a biggie
Always pissy, Carhartts and Dickies
Army fatigues suits gangstas with no pitty
You say it's on site, you better carry the blickey
Say you wanna smoke, you better light up the sticky
I keep the sour, Kiss keep the piffy
Louch bring the liquor, we rep for the whole city (L-O-X)
The women and lights and the cars are so pretty
Singin' Hov and Keys, Frank Sinatra
Disappearin' with your bitch in a Porsche Boxster
Read my lips, you gon' be the next Jim Hoffer
Actin' like a bitch and this hammer is the Oscar
Nigga

[Outro]
Big, big champagne and Moet
You gon' party 'til you sweat
(Can you say New York city?)
The moneys yours to get
Big, big champagne and Moet
You gon' party 'til you sweat
(Can you say New York city?)
The moneys yours to get
Can you say-can you say-can you say New York City?
Can you say L-O-L-O-L-O-X?
U-Neek!
L-O-L-O-L-O-X
On the beat
L-O-L-O-X
L-O-X, L-O-X, L-O-X, L-O-X
L-O
L-O
L-O-X
