Schemin' on the paper cause I've been doing my thing since beat street breakers Kareem was in the Lakers
Magic got drafted DJ Red Alerted Mr. magic got blasted good old days
I was just a yougin' wishing my mother had money like Phillip Drummond thinking of killing something
Cuz poverty is rougher than a brillo pad
Poor ass folks who's wishing that they was middle class
Middle class folks who's dreaming that they'll get rich
Now im high in the Benz just leaning up in this shit
Black america white america
The green dollar bill i'll show you a persons character
Flippin' like barnes in platoons Tom Berenger
It is religion or rely on gin
Kamikaze throwing the bomb and diving the pen
Alot of niggas throw up they sets when they riding in the pen
Lots of niggas losing they life's cuz they dying to win
Is it 5 prayers a day or 2 prayers a day
Going thru bullshit I need some new prayers to say
Thinking of my seed I planted in this world full of greed
The rain look purple like the weed
The circle of succeed success is what we greed
Honor and loyalty is the code and the creed
Thinking of the goals I sold blow to a g
Gimme a second let me gather my thoughts
Mad high in the court like why I had to get caught
Mad money to the lawyer more to the bail bond
Thinking if I got to do time then I feel strong
That whole idea just feels wrong
If you're sick in the head then get your heal on
You don't want to dance in the devil then its ugly
Trust me the tip of the blade is rusty
Catch me in black label new denim more rugby
Connect got it cheaper than mine nigga then plug me
Hard like Malone yeah Karl Moses or Bugsy
Bugsy Malone or Bugsy Moran
When a life full of crime but I do what I can
Im legit now spit now nigga im the shit now
Is the ghost on the blaze beat
I ain't met a rapper alive that can phase me
