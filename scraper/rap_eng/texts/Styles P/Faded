Here we go!
Same old shit, same old niggas I don't even fuck with
Same old bitch say a nigga ain't shit
Same old pussy ass niggas ?
So, let me get faded
Turn the mic on while I get faded
Hold on my nigga let me get faded
Turn the lights down let me get faded
Here we go!

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Let me get faded
Me and Benjamin Franklin it's like we related
Me and Mary Jane we get so sedated
Aslong as you respect it you could love it or hate it
It's the same old shit
If the rap don't work, then the cane gone flip
Just a juice bar nigga in the mango six
And my lingo kick, and I bang my shit
Hold up, hold up, let me get faded
Roll up a eight of the sour high graded
You could copy but you just can't paste it
You can smell the weed but you sure can't taste it

[Hook: Tyler Woods]
Here we go!
Same old shit, same old niggas I don't even fuck with
Same old bitch say a nigga ain't shit
Same old pussy ass niggas ?
So, let me get faded
Turn the mic on while I get faded
Hold on my nigga let me get faded
Turn the lights down let me get faded
Here we go!

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Ayo, I was young, I was gettin' my hair braided
Momma pullin' on my scalp, like god damn I hate it
Now I'm sittin' in the coupe like, god damn I made it
I ain't seen you in my life, how we god damn related?
That's why I get faded
No matter if I spit the hottest shit I'm underrated
No matter if I fuck the hottest bitch I'm still skating
We ain't drop in years but our fans is still waiting
Got a new man and a baby
How the fuck you still hating?
We ain't even touchdown but our numbers is still Peyton
Every day is percocet ?
We get faded

[Hook: Tyler Woods]
Here we go!
Same old shit, same old niggas I don't even fuck with
Same old bitch say a nigga ain't shit
Same old pussy ass niggas ?
So, let me get faded
Turn the mic on while I get faded
Hold on my nigga let me get faded
Turn the lights down let me get faded
Here we go!

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yeah let me get faded
You are now rocking with Shawn, Jason, and David
We solid gold, these niggas is gold plated
The only reason you still alive, I OK'd it
Haha, yep, same old kiss
Still in the hood on the same old strip
Sticking to the story, yea the same old script
If your formula works then don't change your shit
Hold up, hold up, let me get faded
Everything's for sale but I prefer to keep the haze lit
Ain't about money might as well not even say shit
Get shot or get bladed, we get faded
