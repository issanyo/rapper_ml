[Verse 1: Fortes]
No rushin' greatness, whole bunch of patience
Paranoia too, I think I just saw an agent
Caught up in the matrix
Thought of every outcome to every single situation
Work like I've never been vacation
I don't need to soul-search, or try to find a passion
Rappers can't rap now, so they tryin' fashion
Posin', Vogue-in', they want to be on Maxim
I'm laughin' as I'm rappin' cause I know it's time for action
You're the type to read a book and skim a page
Not inhale when you blaze, forgive me, I'm in a phase
Spotlight on the center stage, give me praise while I'm livin'
I am clutch, I am driven, I am givin' people gems
Up to them if they listen, everything is math and science
I'm formin' a rap alliance, sometimes we resort to violence
Wait until you hear the ghost like we're recordin' silence
The white noise, yeah, the right noise

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Yeah, shout out Nickel and Preemo though
Forty-four long on one of Biggie's Moscino hoes
Shoot it, throw it like Dan Marino, yo
Bury him in the desert, I watch too much Casino, yo
The problem: it's no desert here
Shoot him with Desert then, I made myself very clear
Memoirs of a mad man's memory
Fortes probably lightin' weed by the cemetery
Me, I rock a tank top in February, Goose when it's July
Fuck you and that ho you flew out to Dubai
We ask to keep (-), yeah, I'm probably on a new high
Call that shit my new ride
I make you duck down like I'm 'Dru Ha'
They know it's me cause the odor reeks
Automatic gun, they think I came with a (-)
Jedi on 'shrooms, yeah, I can hear Yoda speak
I hustle fucked up, then I probably make my quarter geek
You don't get it, you dumbfuck
Then blame it on dumb luck when you leavin' the dump truck
Cause I don't give a fuck when I'm lettin' the gun buck
Yeah, nigga
Me verse you is like a wolf verse a Yorkie, nigga
I see you sweet, but you salty, nigga
Ain't my fault, so why the fuck would you fault me, nigga?
