[Intro: Styles P]
Ghost, violence, it's that other kinda shit
This is mine right here nigga, haha, oh yeah
(You thought the world was safe)

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Homicide goon with shit bags, triple niggas
I don't give a fuck when Police get dispatched
Wicked nigga, you can hear me laugh when the click-clack
Look at me, you can see me smile when the kickback
Before rap, ask where my gun and my clip at
Got my hands on it, then I ask where the strip at
Niggas got coke, then I ask where the bricks at
Next rapper that lies, the next rapper I'll click at
Bullet holes in your Louis clothes
Get wrapped the fuck up like a sushi roll
Soft niggas get wet like the coochie hole
Cootie nigga put my gun on goofy though

[Chorus: Kody]
Got my heat on my side and I'm gonna ride
Trust me if you crossed that line, man, it's over
In the heat of the night, man, I'm gonna ride
It get cold (cold, cold)
(Cold, cold)

[Verse 2: Styles P]
My gun burn niggas like the way I burn Cali weed
Or the way a fat burner burns calories
Fuck a treadmill, my 9 mil's the deadmill
You can fuck around and get your head spilled (fuck around)
Or your guts dropped
You a goner, I'ma G that can play any corner like the bus stop
Fuck around and get your slug popped
Had a bitch on the floor like a dust mop
Still gettin' money in the dusk spot
Cut you in the face with the blade we use to cut rock
Hunnid shot Tommy Gun about to make the buck pop
Shotgun next, you hit with the buckshots

[Chorus: Kody]
Got my heat on my side and I'm gonna ride
Trust me if you crossed that line, man, it's over
In the heat of the night, man, I'm gonna ride
It get cold (cold, cold)
(Cold, cold)

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Flyin' without a cape, right, I ain't on a safe flight
Underworld, turn into a Lycan in the late night
Flyin' through the city in a seis, no brake lights
Beamer on, Nina on, probably got Tina on
I can't stand the rain or the pain
Nigga sippin' on drain for flippin' cocaine
But you smile when you smokin' and you whippin' all lanes
Sippin' champagne and you trickin' on dames
When you go to Hell, are you sittin' on flames?
Type of shit I think about sittin' on planes
First class, if I crash, shit'll all change
All I do is get high 'cause shit is all strange

[Chorus: Kody]
Got my heat on my side and I'm gonna ride
Trust me if you crossed that line, man, it's over
In the heat of the night, man, I'm gonna ride
It get cold (cold, cold)
(Cold, cold)
