[Intro]
You fuck with it, fuck with it
You don't, fuck you, it don't matter anyway
Word, nigga
Ayy

[Verse 1]
Who gettin' it first?
You gon' be the one that get it the worst
Yeah, these rap niggas is pussy, you oughtta get 'em a purse
If they try me, you just oughtta get 'em a hearse
'Cause the Ghost back, told you that's it's Holiday time
I'm the illest out, are these niggas out of they mind?
Let me reintroduce myself, I'm pain's brother
If I'm kickin' a rhyme, I'm flames, brother
Every rapper under the sun, whoever the rain covers could get it
Yeah, I'm with it, I was never a sane brother
I told you I'm a lyric assassin
When it comes to the craft, I will kill you for passion
Niggas rhyme whack, other niggas is laughin'
You on the wrong wave, need to get you a captain
Yeah, nigga, hop on that Ghost ship
Heard what you sayin' but it wasn't no dope shit
It wasn't legal money, then I'd be in a dope flips
I'm Ghost, kid

[Chorus]
Like I give a fuck
Niggas sayin' they top five, like I give a fuck
We can let shots fly, like I give a fuck
They could die or not die, like I give a fuck (yeah)
Like I give a fuck
Niggas sayin' they top five, like I give a fuck
We can let shots fly, like I give a fuck
They could die or not die, like I give a fuck (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Ever pray to God for some wrong shit?
Like the coke plug come with some strong shit?
Gun runners come with some long shit
Kiss is Jason, I'm on some Bourne shit
Sheek is Sean, I'm on some Price shit
Loadin' up, yellin' out P before I light shit
If it wasn't for rap, it'd be that white shit
On the corner yellin' out the product and the prices
We hustlin' hard, we on the night shift
Hunnidd percent, niggas is hood-made
School of Hard Knocks, you alive, that's a good grade
Me and eight niggas, that's a good fade
All I need is a pair of brass knuckles and a good blade
African nigga born in America
Fuckin' you up, bet you I bury you
Ignorant nigga causing hysteria

[Chorus]
Like I give a fuck
Niggas sayin' they top five, like I give a fuck
We can let shots fly, like I give a fuck
They could die or not die, like I give a fuck (yeah)
Like I give a fuck
Niggas sayin' they top five, like I give a fuck
We can let shots fly, like I give a fuck
They could die or not die, like I give a fuck (yeah)

[Verse 3]
Yeah
Like I give a fuck
You don't know Ghost, homie, I give it up
Vacate all the time, I live it up
Step up on your block; strapped, I sig it up
You could pass the aux cord, I'll BIG it up
Niggas is sleep, but fuck it, I'll get 'em up
You could pass the strap, yeah, I'll hit 'em up
Yeah, I'm Ghost, smell the smoke because I lit it up
GHOST!

[Chorus]
Like I give a fuck
Niggas sayin' they top five, like I give a fuck
We can let shots fly, like I give a fuck
They could die or not die, like I give a fuck (yeah)
Like I give a fuck
Niggas sayin' they top five, like I give a fuck
We can let shots fly, like I give a fuck
They could die or not die, like I give a fuck (yeah)
