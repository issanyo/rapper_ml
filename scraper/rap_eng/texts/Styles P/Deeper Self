[Verse 1: Styles P]
Chain-smokin' the reefer help me get into my deeper self
Make the ground crack
Make the ether melt
Make the wind whirl
Make the river rise
Even pre-recorded the nigga live
You can't see the world through a nigga eyes
Hear through a nigga ears
Yeah, real nigga here
Ghost back
Space Ghost
I'll bake it up to keep the cake close

[Hook: Styles P]
Chain-smokin' the reefer help me get into my deeper self
Plug the mic in
Make the speakers melt
Touch me, I touch you;
Let the heater melt
I'm from the 'hood
Where everybody need the help
Chain-smokin' the reefer help me get into my deeper self
Plug the mic in
Make the speakers melt
Touch me, I touch you;
Let the heater melt
I'm from the 'hood
Where everybody need the help
You a follower, better lead yourself

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Materialistic, but wouldn't sell my soul for material
Homie die, we all go fly to the burial
In the slums I'm grand royal imperial
Who ride, burner with the scratched off serial
Niggas act funny when the money get made
But I ain't the turkey the honey glazed
Niggas'll eat your food like a plate that your honey made
I think of the Lefty and Sonny days
I inhale, I hold it in
Salute to the silence of all the golden men
Smoke touch the pain, but I just couldn't hold it in
Exhale, the pain stay
Used to pitch, the game didn't cancel on rain day
Cy Young; I'd rather live old than die young
And smile at death when my time come
[?] niggas even wonder where my mind from

[Hook: Styles P]
Chain-smokin' the reefer help me get into my deeper self
Plug the mic in
Make the speakers melt
Touch me, I touch you
Let the heater melt
I'm from the 'hood
Where everybody need the help
Chain-smokin' the reefer help me get into my deeper self
Plug the mic in
Make the speakers melt
Touch me, I touch you;
Let the heater melt
I'm from the 'hood
Where everybody need the help
You a follower, better lead yourself

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Powder, power, pretty bitches and pistols
Playin' you, prayin' them people do not get you
Real jack boys, them niggas will not strip you
Hit you, headshot; niggas will not miss you
Closed casket, your family will not kiss you
Fishscale niggas don't care about the fiscal
Time in the drought'll make a dope boy dismal
We can stick the spot, get paid; see the visual?
It's that easy, it's that quick
I'm after it, since crack dealers was pushin' Acuras
Time move forward and not backwards
Bastards; we take ours, we not askin'

[Hook: Styles P]
Chain-smokin' the reefer help me get into my deeper self
Plug the mic in
Make the speakers melt
Touch me, I touch you;
Let the heater melt
I'm from the 'hood
Where everybody need the help
Chain-smokin' the reefer help me get into my deeper self
Plug the mic in
Make the speakers melt
Touch me, I touch you;
Let the heater melt
I'm from the 'hood
Where everybody need the help
You a follower, better lead yourself
You a follower, better lead yourself
