[Verse 1: Styles P]
Come and get you some
It's like Juice when Bishop come
Make a lil' money, watch them bitches come
If it's dope money, watch the snitches come
Watch where you sell it at
Watch where you get it from
What you do it for?
Used to duck a two to four
More bucks, now that tour bus need a humidor
Got a couple stores, 'bout to get a couple more
Life's a bitch so I light a spliff, gonna fuck her raw
Yeah we gettin' rich, what you think we duck the suckas for?
I don't want you shot or gettin' stomped with these chuckas, dawg
I told Berner to pull the strings out
I'd rather get high then ride and blow your brains out

[Hook: Berner]
Let the money come, yeah let the money come
Come and get you some, come, come and get you some
Old schools, fat crib in the hills too
No twenties, no fifties, these my bills blue
Come and get your sum, come, come and get you some
Old schools, fat crib in the hills too
No twenties, no fifties, these my bills blue

[Verse 2: Berner]
I've been sucka-duckin', I've been tryna get my mind right
I said we be around, I got nine lives
I'm sleepwalking, watchin' time fly
Smoke pourin' out of the coupe when I fly by
Late night mission keep me out of prison
This isn't livin', all the hatred and the killin'
I just wanna raise my children (jeah)
I really the hate way I'm feelin'
No trust, no love, just a dirty gun
[?] goin' for thirty-one, Bern can you turn me on?
They want the line and I ain't tryna talk to anyone
I was O.T. with O.Gs when I was twenty-one

[Hook: Berner]
Let the money come, yeah let the money come
Come and get your sum, come, come and get you some
Old schools, fat crib in the hills too
No twenties, no fifties, these my bills blue
Come and get your sum, come, come and get you some
Old schools, fat crib in the hills too
No twenties, no fifties, these my bills blue

[Verse 3: Berner & Styles P]
Been through hella shit
The bullets and the .454'll kill a elephant
Fresh drop of lemonade, yeah I like the smell of it
These rappers only worry 'bout they relevance (Sad)
Mad that they ain't got the elegance
Nor the intelligence to make it big
We hustle hard and we hate the bid and hate the pigs
And if a nigga ain't around I'm where the paper is
Jeah, I'm with the brown bag, threw away the money counter
I like to count it by hand, it took me six hours
Shout to the sick flowers
And the trip routers
Get high from the contact if you sit 'round us

[Hook: Berner]
Let the money come, yeah let the money come
Come and get your sum, come, come and get you some
Old schools, fat crib in the hills too
No twenties, no fifties, these my bills blue
Come and get you some, come, come and get you some
Old schools, fat crib in the hills too
No twenties, no fifties, these my bills blue
