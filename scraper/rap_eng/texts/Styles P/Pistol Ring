[Intro: Nino Man]
Ring!
Hah haha
They still think it's a game?
Yeah, I think they still think it's a game
I got somethin' for y'all
Nino Man

[Verse 1: Nino Man]
All this Rosé and Patrón, it got me lit
Anywhere I go you know I got the grip
You could ask anyone you know we with the shit
When I was young my mother said I was a trip
Now I'm out there on the strip servin' those who need a fix
Be on the block like I dimes, yo, I got mix
But keep away from sucka niggas 'cause they snitch
Tougher than street bagoda, jealous on a bitch
Everybody sayin' they real but who's not?
Most niggas talkin' that shit be true opps
Lames know I pull up on niggas like tube socks
Put a nigga lights out like I blew up they fuse box

[Chorus: Nino Man]
Don't let me make that pistol ring
Ring
Ring
Ring
Don't let me make that pistol ring
Ring
Ring
Ring
Dumpin' on a nigga with the hammer on me
Got a mask on 'case the camera on me
Don't let me make that pistol ring
Don't let me make that pistol ring

[Verse 2: Nino Man & Styles P]
Man, don't let me make that pistol ring
I rate official games
I don't care about your set and all that shit you claim
Comin' at that Nino Man, nigga, won't get you fame
That shit just gon' get you shot or get a nigga hanged
I carry 'round heat 'cause I get into wild beef
Let's see what they do when they run into Styles P
Let that pistol ring just like the phone do
Lettin' off six shots, runnin' up on you
Lookin' at your main man, ask him what he gon' do
I ain't with that fuck shit, nigga shoulda warned you
Probably informed you
You thought it was bullshit
You don't fuck with S-P, you'd rather suck a bull dick
Now you suck a big gun and it got a full clip
Squeeze 'til it's empty, you don't wanna tempt me
Let my pistol bang, nigga, you could ask Nino Man
Run it in New York like I'm with the Gambino fam'
Ghost

[Chorus: Nino Man]
Don't let me make that pistol ring
Ring
Ring
Ring
Don't let me make that pistol ring
Ring
Ring
Ring
Dumpin' on a nigga with the hammer on me
Got a mask on 'case the camera on me
Don't let me make that pistol ring
Don't let me make that pistol ring
