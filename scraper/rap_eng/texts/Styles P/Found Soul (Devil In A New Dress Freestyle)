[Verse]

Most of the family Christian, but most of the homies Muslim
Me and him talking while I'm puffing, so I'm nothing
This is my dream: when I'm a sleep, that's reality
No formalities, back to the essence gradually
I don't trust religion, it's a few people mad at me
See you on the other side where we could build happily
I stay low, but I roll so high
I don't need new friends, 'til some old ones die
I seen a dollar bill could make close friends part
That's why I love Louch and Kiss, those's both my hearts
Brothers from other mothers, other fathers, but same Father
Put the hoodies on, fuck the umbrellas, let it rain on us
We could tell you that the sun gon' shine
But if you in a dark alley, the chrome gun gon' shine
You could see it, even fake jewels shine
That's why the industry niggas'll let the fake dudes sign
I ain't bitter cause the shit is so sweet
I had nightmares of drowning cause my shit is so deep
Probably from the ocean floor, but I'm a fire sign
Yeah I'm on my sad shit, breaking down the ghost of y'all
Space Ghost, Phantom shit, cannon in the cannabis
Gun came from Germany, weed Los Angeles
You ain't gon' eat if you ain't put a hand in this
You ain't on no mob shit if you ain't on no family shit... nigga
