You think niggas are colored?
Nigga's a behavior
There's all kinds of niggas

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Too much black on black crime nigga
That's something real we can't fake about
But that doesn't give a right for a white cop
To pull his handgun and take us out
I love a lot of cool white folks
But be blind, I refuse nigga
You can't pull a bunch of articles
Of black cops killing white kids
On the news nigga

[Hook: Styles P]
White boy in hip hop, you a nigga too
Racist ass cop you, you a nigga too
If you ever said nigga, you a nigga too
But this is God's house so tell me
Where's the living room?

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Give me some racist crackers and just sit 'em down
Let me tell 'em some shit, that they ain't figured out
You're little white son, in his room playin' hip hop loud
That's my nigga man
Yeah I said it, he a nigga too
You wanna kill me? You should kill him too
If this is God's house, where's the living room?
I'm strapped and I see a white cop
Should I give it to him?
Like fuck it, I'm the enemy
You wanna kill me and my seeds, that's the energy
Malcolm, Martin and Mandela, it's all memories
Better start remembering, the fist keep 'em tremblin'

[Hook: Styles P]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
I swear to God with my right hand
Most of the racists are scared of the white man
Cause they'll take a foreign land and make it a white land
And the whole time the bible's on the night stand
It ain't a black clan, it's a white clan
Why you wanna shorten our life span
We made it a matter, so it got to matter
You a nigga too
You wouldn't hear that from a lot of rappers

[Hook: Styles P]

We all need to live!
We matter! We muthafuckin' matter!
Our lives matter! Our kids lives matter!
Nigga!
