[Intro: Puff Daddy]
See, I want to get back to the love
Let's start love over, come on

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
Let's start love over
Back to the way things were
Forget about them
Cause all we got is us
We can make it
Sad if we try
I want to start love over
Let's make it do or die

[Verse 1: Styles P]
When I was nine years old
I realized there was a road
At the end I would win lots of pots of gold
Days, when I used to have my play clothes on
I would make up my rhymes the middle of Voltron
But you've learned what the herbs do
Breaking curfew
Hit the park when it's dark, make it stand like a podium
Niggas had a box and a strip of linoleum
Some break a boogie but those that don't
Was usually a fighter
Rollin' E-Z Widers
Sending people to the store for a soda and a lighter
A real cool cat that would let you keep a dollar
But now things change and it's the days of tomorrow
Little kids is big now
They'll push your wig now
Can't send them to the store
But you can send them for raw
So I speak my mind
And put them on my vine
And give them one big push for all mankind

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
Let's start love over
Back to the way things were
Forget about them
Cause all we got is us
We can make it
Sad if we try
I want to start love over
Let's make it do or die

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
People still taking rapping for a joke
A passing hope
Or a phrase with a rope
What ever happened to the caddies, white walls, and spokes?
Crates of records, turntables, plenty of folks
Remember playing in the streets, touch football
Look y'all, somebody get mad and bounce with they football
Twenty four hour block parties
Everybody on the block pissy offa dark Cardi
Adults used to think I was scheming
But I was dreaming to one day make a hot album and have 'em all fiendin'
Now everytime that I rhyme I can tell that you like it
Be nursing the tunes like the mind of a psychic
Your mind is weary, floating like a dove
Sweating and things, like you were making love
Control the crowd so they can accept it
Total concentration is the perfect method

[Bridge: Puff Daddy]
Where's the love?
Somebody tell me
Where's the love?
Because we want to know
I remember everybody I loved, everybody
It wasn't always player hating
There wasn't jealousy and all this envy
It was the love

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Ayo hip hop
Set out in the park
What?
We used to do it out in the dark
All night long till the cops made us go
Or till somebody's moms pulled the extension cord from the window
Lees on, thinking you fresh
Trying to impress
Shorty with the baby hair pushed down on her forehead
Ponytail swaying, she hot
Standing like she bow legged, but she not
You remember the days?
That's when crack was affecting blacks like that
Just drink some Valentine Ale, little reefer
Friday night, go check out Star Child at the Fever
Now it's all corrupt
Over rap you might get bust
Say the wrong thing
End up in a permanent sling
Went from shelltops to hollowtops
Used to rock the bus stop
Now we electric slide from the cops
Lost some veterans in this
That ain't keeping it real
Now with God they chill over a record deal
Always the good ones to go
Never your enemies die
Till this day I wonder why they took my man B.I
No time to yell rhymes in the microphone
[Take this more serious than just a poem](pending)
Rock party to party
While you're out the door
But tear it up yo, let's start love over

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
Let's start love over
Back to the way things were
Forget about them
Cause all we got is us
We can make it
Sad if we try
I want to start love over
Let's make it do or die

[Outro]
Where's the love?
Somebody tell me
Where's the love?
Because we want to know
Where's the love?
Somebody tell me
Where's the love?
Because we want to know
