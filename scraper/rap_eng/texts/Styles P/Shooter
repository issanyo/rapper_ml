[Chorus: AP & Snyp Life]
This is for the shooters, stabbers, late night stragglers
Run up in the dope spot, niggas that'll clap ya
Ain't shit funny 'cause it's money that we after
Robbin' all you fuckin' wack rappers (D-Block)
This is for the shooters, stabbers, late night stragglers
Run up in the dope spot, niggas that'll clap ya
Ain't shit funny 'cause it's money that we after
Robbin' all you fuckin' wack rappers (D-Block)

[Verse 1: AP]
Niggas is back, that's what they sayin' when they hear paper
Spit now, sitdowns all it took 'em
Back on my set now
Trapped in a glitch, young bitch I used to dick down
Hit me with a sonogram
