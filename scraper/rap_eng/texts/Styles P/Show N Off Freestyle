Fuck all these niggas, they could eat a dick, bar none
And I'm on the bar, so I'm telling these niggas on bar one
Double X L flow, nigga I'm a one X
Flow first, guns next -- all these niggas is dumb sex
Shoot em in the face, then the chest, then the lungs next
One shot, one dead; nigga, I'm a blunt-head gun-head
Bloodied up high -- that's dumb red
Stupid with the gun, getting money -- that's dumb bread
Fuck whoever's nice, fuck whoever's not nice
Fuck about your whip, I pop you up at the stoplight
You saying what you like, I could tell you what you not like
You not nice, you not real
Yeah, I'm in the Ritz but I be on the block, still
Holding on the Glock, still
You don't want static
You might want to beep a nigga, you don't want Static
I pull out the automatic
Shelter terminology
Peep the terminology
Twitter's the only time you better motherfucking follow me
Unless you giving money out, something like the lottery
Plant you like some weed, or some motherfucking pottery
Whoever said they was hard, nigga, you owe a fucking apology
Old head, young head
Yeah, it's blue steel, but I could make the gun red
Stick it in your guts the second after I pump lead
Cocksucker, disgusted with it
Holler back, nigga, if you was fucking with it
Yeah, you got a gun, but you pussy and you ain't bucking with it
Motherfucker
