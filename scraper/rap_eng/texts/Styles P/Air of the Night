Shit we'd rather die 'fore we cry broke
Go and rob a nigga, take the money and buy coke
All for a whip, a couple kicks and a fly coat
Shit we might flip if we ain't able to buy smoke
If we hopeless are we able to buy hope?
Still don't get a thrill and I kick it like Tae Bo
Deal with the demons
No sleep, I ain't been dreaming
Only nightmares what I'm seeing
What's it gon' take?
I guess another funeral or wake
But these niggas wanna see you upstate
Nigga this is Betty Crocker shit, Johnson & Johnson
Nigga I'm talking 'bout powder and cake
More green than the forest
Aim real mean with the taurus
And my man said I need to read Asura
Nigga this the closest to religion I'm a get
Leave a body on the stoop
To let the niggas get my drift
Or better yet the draft
Subtract the bodies, you could do the math
Do you really wanna walk down this path?
Yeah I'm in good health, living a sick life
Doing wrong shit but it's getting me rich right
Looking at the cars and the crib
Is it worth what I did?
But who can I ask "can i live"?
I don't really know so that's why I'm hard as it get
But I still ask god to forgive
Nigga...
