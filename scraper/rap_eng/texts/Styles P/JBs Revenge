[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Single back door, jungle brothers flow
Burner in my hand just tell me when to go
Stay away from rats, never trust a cop
You might have sold more but I'm lyrically on top
I never left the hood, I’m just not around
It's hard to be there and get your business off the ground
So I smoke a pound to the early days
Real niggas, fat ass bitches and finger waves
Educated man, from New York land
Yeah I made it in rap but that’s not all I am
I'm a cool brother and that's word to mother
I smack the fuck out of one of y'all
Blood on the wall at a live show
Yeah my niggas been on it since the locks go
Who the realest group out? How could you not know?
Anytime you hear our shit, how could you not blow?
I mean I'm strictly tryna cop those Picassos
Birds in North Carolina, Petey Pablo
El Guapo, Diablo, El Choppo
We reup again nigga when the stash low

[Verse 2: Styles P]
We was in school, we was on the block and
We was touching 8 balls but wasn't playing pool
Raised in the crack epidemic, [?]
So we thought making drug money looked cool
All I really wanted was to act [?]
With a goose with good feathers
On some new leathers and some dime bags
Drink a 40 ounce just to watch time pass
For the Dutch days nigga, get a wipe out
Never wave the white flag, never throw a white towel
From the bomb squad, all them niggas rhyme hard
Any letter scrap, get drunk and blow the tromb god
A bunch of little niggas that be running around
And they got organised, start running the town
Felt good to see 100s around, thousands around
And every time I rhyme, niggas crowding around
Yeah I'm the quiet one, the loudest around
