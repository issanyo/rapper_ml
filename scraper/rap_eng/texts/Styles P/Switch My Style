G-H-O-S-T
Give me a G-U-N
And some S-M-O-K-E
I'm on the B-L-O-C-K
With a G-L-O-C-K
With my bad bitch, and she came from BK
Heard about the work, and they ran and told the DA
D.A. told the feds how I had it out in VA
Now I'm on the L-O-W
It's fucked up cause all I tried to do was be L-O-W
Hate them R-A-T's
Give me a M-A-C
I'll make them motherfuckers RIP
I'm in the H-double-O-D
It's G-double-O-D
I ain't a B or a C
But you could believe I'm a OG
A W-double-E-D in the O-Z
760LI and I'm low key
S dot P dot W-W-W dot com, cocksucka
Imma let the heat pop

Got to switch my style
A lot of niggas bitin it
They shit sound like mine
I might as well be writin it
Got to switch my style
A lot of niggas lickin cock
Frontin like the ghost
But them niggaa wouldn't lick a shot
Got to switch my style
It's a 1000 little me's
Only thing, I'm majorin
And them motherfuckers little league
Got to switch my style
Before I got to body somethin
Nigga you ain't Styles
Why you actin like you'll body somethin

R-U-double-F
R-Y-D-E
D-B-L-O-C-K
'til I D-E, I in the middle
I'm hoppin out the sunroof
So Imma play the backseat ride in the middle
On my Justin Timberlake shit, cry me a river
But niggas need they throats cut, slide me the scissors
No dare touchin us
And niggas call me Glade
Cause if I don't get paid, I spray
Like air fresheners
A lot of niggas sound like I
They don't get down like I
I got the urge to treypound that eye
From the 1st to the 3rd, I give you my word
We got birds, not the type that fly around in the sky
And I'm just tryin to get in my place
Do my thing, while you tryin to be king
I'm steady shootin for ace
And my hoodie stay on, and the boots is laced
You violate, you couldn't take what I'd do to your face
One

Got to switch my style
A lot of niggas bitin it
They shit sound like mine
I might as well be writin it
Got to switch my style
A lot of niggas lickin cock
Frontin like the ghost
But them niggaa wouldn't lick a shot
Got to switch my style
It's a 1000 little me's
Only thing, I'm majorin
And them motherfuckers little league
Got to switch my style
Before I got to body somethin
Nigga you ain't Styles
Why you actin like you'll body somethin

I'm from 354 with a 9 mm
On my 38 waist in a 55 Benz
Get it for 17, sell it for 28
If the money ain't straight, they gunnin the .38's
It's 17 up in my Glock. 4 dutches a box
4 different drugs they sell in the spot
And 911 mean they callin the cops
We get the 411 from the fiend off the block
I got a spot where it's 40 a bag
Niggas old school, still drink 40's
Keep stows and their rags
Bust off the .40 cal. soon as I point at the fag
So it cost P nothin just to 1 your ass

Got to switch my style
A lot of niggas bitin it
They shit sound like mine
I might as well be writin it
Got to switch my style
A lot of niggas lickin cock
Frontin like the ghost
But them niggaa wouldn't lick a shot
Got to switch my style
It's a 1000 little me's
Only thing, I'm majorin
And them motherfuckers little league
Got to switch my style
Before I got to body somethin
Nigga you ain't Styles
Why you actin like you'll body somethin
