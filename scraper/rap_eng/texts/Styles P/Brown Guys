[Verse 1: Styles P]
I am a brown guy
But don't call me nigga, please
Nigga please, you see that white boy, that's a nigga b
Nigga ain't a color, it's a mindstate, you diggin' me?
Maybe not, I get it tho
But all them white boys blowin' weed they some niggas too
The difference is they got white privileges
Cops will kill me but I doubt that they kill 'em too
This ain't a stab or a jab
But I'm feeling kinda mad they ain't treated like a villain too
His weed is good as mine, his gun bigger than mine
And he motherfucking chilling too
Now if my color make you hate me then I hope you go blind
And can't see what your children do
Now that sound kinda harsh
But you would feel like I feel if you had black children too
Racism make you sad and that shit'll have you mad
Sittin' there with a sick face
A dickface, you a dickhead
And what you gonna to with all the people from a mixed race
America is a sick place (you know)
But we paint it to be good
This is big city talk that we spreadin' worldwide
Coming from a humble nigga coming out a poor hood, ghost

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Life of a brown guy
Travel 'round the would with the name of a Muslim man
Now there are some up- and some downsides
The downside is niggas get their spinal cord shattered in police vans
I ain't a Muslim but my friends is
Grew up Christian now I'm sorta spiritual I know it's clich√©
I see colors in the music
We switch it up, you see the gods mix it up like a DJ
You say you're hate ain't based on race, huh
And that you're colorblind and you like Hip-Hop
Like that's some kind of call like you can't get punched in the face, huh
That's why the Hindus and the Sikhs being abused by Islamophobes
Extremism is ugly no matter what or where
People who don't believe in god kill all the time
The Bible more violent than the Quran, you see what's in there?
Ain't no belief system got a monopoly on all the crime
I judge a man by his actions and by his enemies
But they don't show themselves without a good reason
This ain't a TV show, nigga
They think they know the hood cause they seen The Wire, the good seasons
I don't need your sympathy
I don't need your empathy your opinion is not required here
That's why you're hidin' on the Internet
'Cause all that 'Nigga'-shit you're writin' will probably get you fired, yeah
Fucked up, too
