I like to dedicate this mother fucking album
To my brother
Who's gone but he still here with me
No matter where you at we always together
No matter where I'm at we always together
And, besides that i would like to dedicate to my mother fucking niggas
And everbody in tha grind
Streets and the struggle
My nigga D lets keep it going
Gary Field wet it down my niggas
See you when i get there
Lets just mother fucking keep it going
Everybody
Feel the Ghost (Echo)
