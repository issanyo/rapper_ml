[Hook]
Meanie, meanie, meanie, meanie, meanie
Five thousand boomin' watts, sound system, state of the art
Grip 'til nicely, piece tucked neatly
Strapped with the lower band, lower on smash see

[Verse 1 - Styles P]
Five thousand boomin' watts
Real loud, like a gun that boom in Watts
Banging and wild, haze and kush help men fly
I could use my 'nects for pimp ride
I'm not the new shit, I'm not the old shit
I'm the 'ole shit, yeah that's me
S.P., run rhymes like an athlete
So, who wanna meet me at the track meet
Yeah, cause it's highway time
I read rappers real quick like the highway sign
Nah, you can't test me though
Matter fact, you the next exit, bro
Catch me Camp Lo with Camp Lo
Turn the mics up, let the amps go
So I could show you how to rap
Matter fact, your racks off
Can't show you that

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Sonny Cheeba]
Lowa feels like methamphetamine
Heroin high not settling
The high so ill, have a top of the mescaline
Pedaling a tricycle, no wheels
A ? culture
And transform a dope girl to dopamine
That curves for an oyster
All these things occur in my soul cinema

[Verse 3 - Geechi Suede]
On your mark, get set, retro glow
Don't neglect the necklace that's on strobes
Futuristic, linguistics
Open atlas, we attract this
New hemisphere like the hemp peer
You last year, we invent time

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Pete Rock]
Stop frontin', y'all know where the kid be
Catch me in the lab around 1000 beats
Give me 3 feet homie, keystone paper
All hell break loose when the pen hit the paper
Yeah, coming for your spot young bucklands
Saying to myself, been doing this, it's nothing
Your soul brother, nigga
I see you've forgotten
Brass on the knuckles, your head a speed knot
Clown motherfuckers, y'all really worth nada
Spitting over shit like this makes me hotter
P.R., a definite globe trotter
Consider me a black president like Obama
Catch me in the Southern 45 with the llama
Do this for the fam and my mans and them
Take these niggas places they never been
It's the low, Camp that is
You know we come with the raw
And we handle the biz

[Hook]
