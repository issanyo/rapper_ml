[Intro: Styles P]
I.V. this shit is hot like the old jail music
I might as well go in

[Styles P]
I'm a super gangster, G'd up extra
Stretch you out plus the nigga you're next ta
Weeded up, liquored out
On a crate real late, four-fifth is out
I'll let you know if it's a drought or them bricks is out
The Dominicans got 'em but the Columbians shipped 'em out
Know the big time hustlers, all of the drug smugglers
3-Card Molly niggas, crooked card shufflers
Even know the hoes on the ho stroll
Ex-baseheads that got a job, now they got 'em the Soul Glo
Know all of the stick-up kids, dice shooters
Old school niggas that chill and light buddha
Niggas that cop cars and throw work in the engine
Boys that do nothin but buy sneakers and denim
I know niggas that get drunk at the bar
And the young boys who keep the handgun and the pump in the car

[Hook 2X: Styles P]
Up in the hood, it's a lot of gangs and gangsters
But I'm a super gangster
I super grind, I'm tryin to get super paper
Told you I'm a super gangster

[Styles P]
Kick it with the O.G.'s and the parolees
Light a blunt with 'em, tell 'em put out a stogie
The young boys that'll kill yo' ass over a Roley
Maybe even a Fossil; them niggas is hostile
Some ho-ass bitches that bag crack
Throwed up in they ass crack, leave with they bags packed
Go where you tell 'em to go
The O.G. number man who sniff a little blow off the federal note
The white boy that'll sell you a boat
Get your papers cleared up, old church lady that'll tell you it's hope
The politician that'll tell you to vote
And my jail niggas that always get it in, with a sock and the soap
What!

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Styles P]
I'm a super gangster, I fly off haze
I'm invisible, nobody ain't seen me in days
I'll crush every bone in you, I ain't get paid
Got a gun with a laser that shoot out grenades
I'm a super gangster, better ask the hood
All I need is some gloves and a mask, I'm good
I'll rob everything I could, anytime I can
Is S.P. the super gangster? Yes I am
