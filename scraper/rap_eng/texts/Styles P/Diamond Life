[Intro: Styles P]
I’m stupid dope, critical fresh
Can’t even believe this shit
Diamond life, nigga
Ghost, let’s go boo

[Hook: Styles P]
All I do is rhyme a lot
Pulling out pot from my diamond kennels and diamond socks
It’s OG all day
Dutchies and bambles and raw cones, diamond ashtray
And I got on my diamond shirt
With my ice on, that’s diamond work
Holla back if you flyin’ right
Yea homie, welcome to the diamond life

[Verse 1: Styles P]
I’m probably getting my rhymin’ on
I’ve got my diamonds on, and my Diamond on
And I probably got the shining on
Jack Nicholas, bring sun like Saint Nicholas
Give me a gift, I’ll show you a gift to give
I light up the booth like Christmas lights
I could start up the printer like Vincent Price
What the fuck you gonna hate for?
Cause I could ride the flow like a skateboard
Make the money hop like a bunny hop, BMX
I let the gun bark DMX
Who wants to lay up in EMS
You should Run like DMC
Kid ‘bout to count on my T-A-T
Fly 'til we die, you never gonna know when death come
D-Block, diamond to the next one

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Welcome, it’s the OZ for SP
High top, diamond socks, low top SB
I smoke out cause I lounge out
Rap hop a cool when the pro tools bounced out
Me and Poobs blowin’ the ounce out
Take the amounts in and nigga tuck the blouse in
You mad cause I’m flowin’ like a fountain
Spend millions on weed, ask my accountant
Overachiever, insidious sativa
Make you a believer, fresher than leaver
Nigga light the chiba
This is diamond life, throw your D’s up
And you know it’s D-Block
No seeds in it but it popped up
And you know I stay lip too
I miss flyin’ down the supply, I wouldn't bullshit you

[Hook]
