Checks get cut after the clearance
What we dealin' with is hard work and perseverance
Still send a nice ransom note to your parents
I'ma ride this bitch 'til it needs some ball bearin's
Tryin' to renovate the West wing of the mansion
I ain't thinkin' recession, I'm thinkin' expansion
I be in the malls, I don't be in the Hamptons
And I'm playin' the wall but my chain is dancin'
More than 200 on the dash, I'ma tear it
You ain't gotta be nice to pass off appearance
44 mag is the last thing you hearin'
If the work don't make it that's a pass interference
Shots of tequila, shops spendin' calm money at the jeweler
Spendin' house money at the dealer
Double bag the piff 'cause the sour need a sealer
You wanna see a real nigga I just look into the mirror

We about dough, never without dough
Movin' with work outta state in and out flow
Real lyrical, intro to outro
Ralph Lauren table, Ralph Lauren couch, yo
Ralph Lauren everything I fit up in the house though
Whattup to them Polo boys
Who knew Tony couldn't have been Manolo's boy
Yeah, Cartier frames, clear lens though
8 series Beemer, 7 series Benzo
Mobster I'll probably go to hell if my friends go, uh
Never shoot in a blind fury, never
Diamonds like Sprite, it's lemon and lime jewelry

Wreck with the connect, it's okay
Hope you brought somebody to test it, it's okay
Lookout on the look-out said it's okay
We gon' have the fiends singin' like Michel'le
Bangin' hard like them niggas out in East L.A
Little weed from the Bay and the pink all day
Still dope money in the gray mink all day
Just do it while I sit around and think all day
