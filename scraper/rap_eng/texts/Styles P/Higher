[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah, good natured shit

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
All I wan' do is
Seclude myself in the player room
Just classic music and you
How I love when you come through
Lovely body, nice perfume
That's enlightened raise the volume
Lace 70's tunes, as we get in tune
To each other, love
You remind me of my coup
Crusin' on the high rise, makin' moves
Everyday it's like the runway
Cutie pie by one way
Bangin' out my ragtop '68
Hydraulic fluids and thirteens, I call her roller skates
I seen my baby a grinder, a rollin' tray
If you don't know, you gon' learn today
Changin' the expression on a nigga face
Never run out
Mary in here to stay lets build a grow house

[Bridge: Curren$y & Styles P]
Grow house, yeah
Yep, grow house, grow mansion
Let's just build a future
That sound like some cool shit
Worldwide legalize
Word

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Let's get stoned and spend some currency
And blast show room from Curren$y
Currently I'm floatin' off a lot of pounds
Quarterback when it's touchin' down
Inhale, hear the muffler sound
I don't fuck around, I just puff around
An eighth on the wake and bake
Always spend the buck around
A queen dressed in cotoure clothes
Mash the gas when the door close
Shoppin' when the mall close
Rolex or the G-shock
Before rap I had weed spots
Nigga, fuck a detox
Word to spitter in the jet sign
If you owe me one, see me next time
Gas like the Hess sign
Word to [?], shit good like your money is
Just a playboy that knows where his bunny is
No jokes on some funny shit
Legalize worldwide, the grow house is money, kid

[Outro: Styles P]
I don't wanna get arrested for smokin'
Smokin' ain't never killed nobody, nigga
Legalize worldwide
Jet life, block life
Spitter ghost
You already know
Light one, yeah
