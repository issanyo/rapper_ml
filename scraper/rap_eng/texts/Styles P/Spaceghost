Ayo I got the quatro in my triple 5 souls
That leave exit wounds bout big as pot holes
If you dont want no problem keep your fucking mouth closed
Rappers can't see me like these niggas got on blind folds
I ryhme cold, cold hearted, flow retarded
Im from Philly where niggas will draw quicker than an artist
You just an artist
And you ain't hard, You the softest
Plus you ain't nice, Your shit's novice
I spit marvelous
I spit sick shit, make a nigga get nauseaus
Better be cautious
Cuz you dealing with some bosses
Kill you in your own crib, roll you up in yo carpet
Ain't no Ls being took over here, You better chalk it
Or get out-lined in it, nigga im demilit
And plus my back pocket got a baby nine in it
These niggas is finished
They ain't making no noise
I'm the reason why the fiends stuff they straights with the joy
Here to sepereate the Ape from the boys
I go to war with a sword and an iron mask on my face like in Troy
You get decapitated for all that faggot shit you fabricated
I spit pain and you's a lame, i know you have to hate it
Raw Buck nigga, this is spittage at it's greatest
Any nigga step in my path gon get assassinated

Poobs load up a beat
I light a blunt, Load up the heat
And then I go and sit it on the board
On the roof with my bars tryna spit it at the Lord
Stars and the moon
Yea I'm hard and a goon
But my hearts filled with hurt and my brain is consumed
Painful thoughts
Gainful thougts
I need a little change and I'm willing to change of course
But the long hard, road remains the course - I travel
Raps underground Marvin Hagler from the gravel
But I still got my sage bow and arrow
Some say I missed my just do
But I just do what I have to to touch you
Spirit and physical
Yea, I'm a real invidual
Drop alot of science
Name ring bells like a househould appliance
You could ask the giants
Been told y'all niggas that David killed Goliath
Say fuck the cops cuz I stand for defiance
Me and two guns make a real strong alliance
Might be losing now but I bet you I'mma triumph
Yea, I'mma win again
Mad high, been again
Outta state, tryna get cake like Entenmann's
Sara Lee
Who told the streets they could marry me?
No divorce of course I run this shit appearantly
Ghost give you the word it's a mother fucking guarantee

The game grimey don't expect it to be safe
And your safe protect the money, but who's protecting the safe?
And who's protecting you? You start to question your faith
How you real when everything that you representing is fake?
Seen you shake hands I never thought you would shake
When I was looking for love the devil sent me a snake
Betray me like Donnie did Lefty
I'll leave the clip empty
I don't pop in the air
I hold it down like Tony at the top of the stairs
Grind hard, hug the block, had it poppin for years
Lost homies, long story short, im tired of tears
Switched up, fell in love with the game and got married
Four fifth (.45) ridin Dirty like Harry
Your man clap what he don't carry
Me I get it in tryna see my cream grow
Talk Craps, Black Jack, Celo, Bingo
Back at it. Oh yea, that's my jingle
Large and Neem, Big lean, let that thing go
Get my lingo
Still rep Cinco Cinco!
Still negotiating with fiends
The only way to the cream
I'm only chasing a dream
So don't ask me what I sell or what I hustle
Go through hell so that my kids ain't got to struggle
I spit it because it's real and we armed with steel
S.P light it up like Fire Marshall Bill
My nigga mow up OG niggas and all that
Spot like Sals Pizzeria but all black
Show you what I do wit a ball bat
Swing like Mr 3000 be wilin
Haters stay hatin, ladies say they stay stylin
Know how I eat, big plates of baked salmon
Forget about them plans you expecting to spoil
Yea the streets love Large, They respecting me loyal
I'm in the hood like I'm checking the oil
Yea, I get right
The homie you should get like
