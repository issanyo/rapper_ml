Fuck you all you people in disgrace
I just want the sparkle on my face
I was like "the war must stop and now"
I am like "war's not what I'm about"

HEY YOU KNOW I WAS DOWN
AND NOW I FEEL LOUD
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT SORROWS
HEY YOU KNOW I DERAIL
YOU'RE CARRYING MY WEIGHT
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT SORROWS

You and I
Without a care between
You and I
I laugh at everything
Life is on
I'm not on poly-thicks
Future is
Not bad as it used to be

HEY YOU KNOW I WAS DOWN
AND NOW I FEEL LOUD
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT SORROWS
HEY YOU KNOW I DERAIL
YOU'RE CARRYING MY WEIGHT
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT
SORROWS

-strumental-

Hey, you know i was down
And now i feel loud...
HEY YOU KNOW I WAS DOWN
AND NOW I FEEL LOUD
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT SORROWS
HEY YOU KNOW I DERAIL
YOU'RE CARRYING MY WEIGHT
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT
SORROWS...
