[Verse 1: Berner]
What are we here for?
Fuck it, I'm too high
I've put in so much work
Thank God I ain't do time
The OG is 2-5, it used to be 4-8
I still get four grand a pound, I do not play
The smell on my doorstep, I'm nervous to open it
The 'old me' hobby, would've thought I'd be over with
The brown bag turned to armored trucks and a few cars
The new spot got German dogs and a few guards
We really 'bout gunplay, but I don't like violence
Private beach and good weed that's what the vibe is
You know what the time is
Shit, I've been shinin' (bling)
Rolls, gold Patek all covered in diamonds (bust down yeah)
Keep the prices up, I want a nicer truck
Turn the lights off, my eyes will light it up
We won't ever die, this what we grind for
We're all gonna eat, that's what I opened up this line for
Mob ties

[Hook: Berner, Styles P & Scarface]
(Keep, winnin', keep winnin, keep livin', keep livin')
Let the story go on
(Keep, keep winnin', and keep on sinnin' but)
Let the story go on
(Keep, keep friends, keep sinnin')
Let the story go on
(World, world keep movin', can't keep losin')
Let the story go on

[Verse 2: Styles P]
If only the weak talk, only the skilled tall
Really glad they don't, 'cause this money is jail talk
German car, Jewish lawyer, hopin' to bail-walk
Ask them fuck niggas what they want you to fear for
Got the Mary Jane, throw the pass like a Hail, dawg
I ain't scared to shoot, run it when I'm ....., dawg
You fuckin' with a stoner, I get high as the Air Force
High box of air balloons just for a clear thought
Do the impossible, that's what I'm here for
Put you in a hospital, just to be clear y'all
Here for the merged dough, here for the verse, dough
Before the weed, the seed in the brain was the first grow
The eyes was the first lights, remember the worst nights
Ghost, so you couldn't find me with a searchlight
Travelling in the peanut butter coupe with the purp life
Wanted the bred seeds, get the bread if you work right
Yeah nigga

(Keep winnin', keep winnin, keep livin', keep livin')
Let the story go on
(Keep, keep winnin', and keep on sinnin' but)
Let the story go on

Let the story go on
(World, world keep movin', can't keep losin')
Let the story go on

[Verse 3: Scarface]
I've been locked down, I ain't been knocked out
I used to get slept on but not right now
I been lootin' these niggas
Like a drive by, shootin' these niggas
You'd be surprised what a semi could do to these niggas
I was raised in the ghetto, played in the ghetto
Money never changed me so I stayed in the ghetto
And I ain't finna settle, I'm the last of a dyn'
I can't be knocked up offa mine, stop tryin'
Masterminded, I helped to pioneer it
There's smoke so thick in this ...........(?) is like spirits
Of my late ancestors, there's still no justice
Then must we come up or get fucked? No question
As the world keeps spinning so must I keep winning
Ten times ten and you ony get nine in it
I'm addin' up my blessings yet I can't stop sinning
Got a new born, and a drug charge still pending
