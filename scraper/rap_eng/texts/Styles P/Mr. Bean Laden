I feel so alive just when someone's yelling to me
I'm a dog suchlike, tomorrow I will die
No one will save my soul, I'll burn in hell
Oh yeah, that's fun, you have no sympathy 'cause
I'm the worst day of your life, the fact that you deny
The stick in your eye and you just don't like me
THERE'S NOBODY ON THE ROOF
AND THERE'S NOBODY UNDERGROUND
I ALWAYS GO ON FOOT
BUT YOU CAN'T FIND ME AROUND
I STILL LIVE IN A CAVE
AND YOU CAN FIND ME RIGHT THERE
COME AND CATCH ME IF YOU CAN IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME
I can't complain my cave is not that bad
It is so warm and clean, with multicolour screen
It feels like holidays in Baghdad town
I'm not that fat as I look on US tv
I see my videotapes, I see them everyday
I can't believe you just don't like me
THERE'S NOBODY ON THE ROOF
AND THERE'S NOBODY UNDERGROUND
I'M GOING ALWAYS BY FEETS
BUT YOU CAN'T FIND ME AROUND
I STILL LIVE IN A CAVE
AND YOU CAN FIND ME RIGHT THERE
COME AND CATCH ME IF YOU CAN IF YOU DON'T LIKE ME
I feel sorry, for the things you had to learn
Too many warnings, too many warnings
