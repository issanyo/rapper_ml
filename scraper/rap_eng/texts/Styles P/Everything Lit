[Intro] The spread of infections....germs

[Hook: Dave East]
Everything lit
Bad bitch, whole lot of smoke
Hundred thousand dollars worth of coke
Scared of being broke
I meet my connect on a boat
No time to waste, I got to go
Everything lit
Bad bitch, whole lot of smoke
Hundred thousand dollars worth of coke
Scared of being broke
I meet my connect on a boat
No time to waste, I got to go
Everything lit

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Walking all alone like Denzel in Book of Eli
88 aura , velour sweatsuit Fila (old school!)
Connect answered the phone like......meet I
I got a couple pieces, I hope you got you a nina
I'm watching Selena with a bitch from Argentina
She just copped a Beamer, can't pass this bitch steamer
Only me and her can fit in it, a two seats
Black Rose knocking she called up like two divas
Now it's looking like me and three bitches
Fame is kind of cool but at the end I need riches
You set it on fire, can't mend bridges
I'm in the Benz just fucking with twin sisters
Like Tia and Tamara, I'm giving her space
You crowd her and don't allow her
Fresher than a shower, counting money by the hour
Kush in New York, click-off, got heavy, dour
Blunted watching Power

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Bad bitches, whole lot of smoke
Quarter million dollars worth of dope, I'm the Hulk
They ain't want me in the streets to get married
So what we do, we ran off and we elope
Lose a lot of blood then you start to get sleepy
[?] you know what that is weekly
You tell me go to hell and I'ma tell you to meet me
The fire's right here, the desire is what completes me
Piff, liquor, and molly, chicks getting their roll on
I'm just walking round the highrise with my Robe on
Keep the crib warmer, used to have to leave the stove on
Let's get right to the money, ain't no need to prolong
Paper ain't right, headshots with the four long
Niggas fall off cause they don't know how to hold on
If them people grab you, don't ever sing shit
You ain't gotta light nothing up my nigga cause...

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Check it from the aura to the feet
Probably just pulled a lick, got a drug deal to meet
Pull up in the six to the mix like we read
Got a handgun, pretty big zip full of weed from the south side
Hope a prayer shift to the east
In the zone might try to break bones of police
Whoever didn't eat may be feast when the beast die
Used to slang on [?], Jackson and Buenavista
Always painted a picture, none of 'em Mona Lisa
It's more like my tongue is the brush
Kiss said we gettin' money, P it comes in a rush
So the guns in the clutch and the car is the clutch
Ask myself is a mansion and foreign enough
Answer no cause you know you seen the yards and the cuffs
Got a lot but I ain't ask Allah for enough
So I'm searching for the balance, my niggas pull out a chalice
