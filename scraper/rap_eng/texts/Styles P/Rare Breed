[Verse 1: Styles P]
Say my prayers, brush my teeth
Clear my thoughts, roll a leaf
Shower and eat, smoke again, hit the streets
Now you know I'm a G and I'm thinkin' of risin' the keef
L-A and the Bay gettin' geeked for 'bout a week
Knee-deep in some shit in a spot you'll never see
When a deal come, get the deal done, book the next flight
It's all bugged, but when it's more love you are less liked
It's F life or cruise in the F type
You could pick or choose, don't wanna lose on your best night
Talk about your best eye, vision with your third
Livin' on the edge but I pivot on the curve
You don't get it, just know I still give it
When you got it from a block where it's still mad guns and narcotics
Hail Marys and Our Fathers
Inshallah, we could fly and Allah got us

[Break: Dave East & Styles P]
Those of a rare breed
..Nothin' like this
Black version of Pesci
Yeah, nigga
I'm Leonidas
Pinero
You know what's up
Bet I make the bank stop
Homicide rate gon' rise same day that this tape drop

[Verse 2: Styles P]
I get a bark then I hit the lab
I get the room dark then I get to spaz
I see my soul drift when I hit the hash
Get hit with the arrow, yeah, you with the Sag'
Now we could talk Benjamins or things, time is money
Know the pendulum'll swing
I'm from the crack era, know that the gremlins could sing
But the crack babies is crazy, yeah, they mumble everything
It's our generation fault, we fumbled everything
'Cause if the youth ain't gettin' ahead
That mean we ain't teach 'em right about the net and the web
Now this might sound funny, we could brag about money
But lil' homie, that credit ain't second to bread
I wanted to be Scarface then Sosa
As I got grown, thought of Oliver Stone
'Cause if you ain't got a neighbor who could follow you home, yea

..Nothin' like this

Yeah, nigga
I'm Leonidas
Pinero
You know what's up
Bet I make the bank stop
Homicide rate gonna rise same day that this tape drop

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Exhale, watch this smoke blow
Same place where my ghost goes
Know I stay wavy like water, that's the Ghost flow
Throw me in the ocean of fire, I could float though
Meet me on the edge of the cliff, we could both go
We could have it out to the death so we both know
I already know the results, you a slow poke
You can tell whoever you want, this the Ghost show

[Break: Dave East & Styles P]
