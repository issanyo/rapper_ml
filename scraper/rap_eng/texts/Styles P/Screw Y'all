[Verse 1: Styles P]
Hatin niggas thinkin they airing me
Motherfuckers is not scarin me
Nigga you’re not hearing me
Nigga you never heard of me
Won't be the first cocksucker that wanna murder me
Whip engineer down in Germany
Outside's green but the inside’s burgundy
Life ain’t promised but nigga death is a certainty
Bubbling and struggling, yea like the purp with me
And get faded, no hair cut
Elevators broke them niggas and take the stairs up
I’m real, you ain’t nigga so don’t compare us
You the type of nigga I tears up
Just like a tissue
So killing you ain’t no issue
Get stripes in the whistle and you still ain’t official

[Hook x2: Styles P]
So screw yall, I never knew y'all
Your clique be like yellow lights, I’m runnin through y'all
Screw y'all, I never knew y'all
Y'all ribbon at the end of the race, I’m runnin through y'all

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Dance with the devil, I bet you you’ll pay the price
Couple niggas die and a couple will get life
Couple niggas change when they get to see the light
Couple get a second chance and do the same shit twice
Doing wrong shit, but I can do it right
That’s the life, you don’t know what I could welcome you tonight
Get a light, sit back, nigga welcome to the flights
Where the G's fly high, these ride by and you try to bring em low
Me, I’m getting singin' dope out of Singapore
You don’t like that? Nigga middle finger though
These niggas won’t match but I bet you they clingers do
Yap to yo face but the battle swingin low
These first teeth next, you don’t want beef yet
Getting money nigga so I don’t make cheap threats
The tray pound is the big three and you ain’t see the Heat yet

[Hook x2: Styles P]
So screw yall, I never knew y'all
Your clique be like yellow lights, I’m runnin through y'all
Screw y'all, I never knew y'all
Y'all ribbon at the end of the race, I’m runnin through y'all

[Verse 3: Scram Jones]
They say half the world sick in the brain
Takin flicks of a man getting hit by a train
No way, too many people that are rich will complain
While the homeless sing in the rain, living off change
Other countries claim that heroes suicidal
Over here it’s strange, fake killas become idols
Don’t believe in gangsta? Let’s swear on the bible
Keep the enemy close, now yo best friend yo rival
Tryna be honest in a land full of crooks
Whatever you G you're right so go hand you the book
Mom cryin up in court while you can’t even look
Can’t compare to the moms and the kids of Sandy Hook
And who’s written and I wanna know who wrote it
This is the rat race, now we all nothing but rollers
Tryna find the snakes of the grass, I gotta smoke it
Now lookin for the drama, but still waitin for my moment

[Hook x2:]
So screw yall, I never knew y'all
Your clique be like yellow lights, I’m runnin through y'all
Screw y'all, I never knew y'all
Y'all ribbon at the end of the race, I’m runnin through y'all

[Outro:]
Stop fooling with these folks who haven’t been through anything
You are not going to get a flow from people who have not been crushed
The real flow of glory will always come from somebody who’s been crushed
There will be a flow from out of him like you have never seen before
It’s beyond anything you have ever seen before
Somebody shout, let it flow
