[Verse 1]
All these women naked on Instagram
All these men wearin' these women clothes
Listen, love, it's a social site
They got you thinkin' it's a centerfold
Put it in your mental that your body is a temple
But you don't even care 'bout niggas you let into your hand
The pussy free, but the crack cost
Black girl lost, you should know if your man's off
You can tell that it's all wrong when your school likely textin'
The spellin' is all wrong
Forget about the rest like the melon is all gone
No order in the hood like the felons is all gone
I guess they lost the code or forgot about it
They won't help your moms with a bag, that says a lot about 'em
We better teach 'em to stand up
They go straight for the gun, never throwin' they hands up
Won't you think about your family, you really'd man up
I learnt that in the cage
Tried to kill us with crack, tried to kill us with AIDS
This shit is like a book, but you never seein' the page
Inner-city blues got a nigga lightin' the haze
Is it FBI or IRS? Is it DEA or ATF?
Got a nigga sweatin' thinkin', 'Will they take me next?'
I ain't Malcolm, but they about to make me X
I got my brain workin' out, don't make me flex for...

[Outro]
You know how it is, keep your head up, nigga, stay strong
Stand for somethin' or fall for anythin', D-Block, LOX
