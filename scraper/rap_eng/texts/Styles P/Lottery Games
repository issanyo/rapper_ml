[Intro]
Just tryna breathe out here, you know?
Find that peaceful place
Tryna relax, you know?
Grow old on some cool stoner, smokin', vibed out shit, ya dig?

[Verse 1]
Wasn't expected to be shit
I came up rough, I expected to be slick
I came up poor, I expected to be rich
Joke's on you for neglectin' this G shit
My Pops died, left his all for me
I asked God, "Hold my daughter for me"
Feel my pain, light a quarter for me
Money's cool but respect's more important for me
Goin' through it with trust issues
Loved by all, I got me enough issues
Questin' for peace but I be on the streets thinkin'
I ain't got me enough pistols
Watchin' my back but I'm sayin' the fuck wit'chu?
I'm already in the mix
If they want a nigga dead, I'm already on the list
Kickin' through the mud, I been holdin' steady in this shit
If I got the plug, never actin' petty with this shit
Throw me in the whip, I am like Andretti on the stick
This the fast life but I hit the brakes
Threw it in neutral, I'm tryna get in place
'Cause niggas'll shoot you right up in your face
I pass you a joint knowin' the shit is laced
I'm thinkin', "God damn, could I get a break?"
Life's a bitch, when you eat her out, it leave a bitter taste

[Chorus]
Life's a bitch, who am I to complain?
If it's joy, then there gotta be pain
If it's sun, then there gotta be rain
Life's a bitch, try to hit it like the lottery game
Life's a bitch, who am I to complain?
If it's joy, then there gotta be pain
If it's sun, then there gotta be rain
Life's a bitch, try to hit it like the lottery game

[Verse 2]
I'm just lookin' to find my happy place
When you a die a couple niggas'll give you accolades
Activate my chi to evacuate
Meditate, smoke one, break down, evaporate
Momma told me she loved me but God love me more
Sleep and ask the Heavens, what could God love me for?
Told to deal with my demons, I did it all wrong
Served myself a little weed, yeah, it was hard bein' poor
Please excuse me for not actin' Godly before
My rapport mean a lot to me, my armies adored
May my seed be blessed and the sea be blessed
And this weed be blessed from my ominous force
Ghost

[Chorus]
Life's a bitch, who am I to complain?
If it's joy, then there gotta be pain
If it's sun, then there gotta be rain
Life's a bitch, try to hit it like the lottery game
Life's a bitch, who am I to complain?
If it's joy, then there gotta be pain
If it's sun, then there gotta be rain
Life's a bitch, try to hit it like the lottery game
Life's a bitch, who am I to complain?
If it's joy, then there gotta be pain
If it's sun, then there gotta be rain
Life's a bitch, try to hit it like the lottery game
