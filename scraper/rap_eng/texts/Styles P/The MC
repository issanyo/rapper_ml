[Styles P]
Kings lose crowns, teachers stay intelligent
That's what KRS said
The Ghost nigga, time is money
Double R, D-Block
Poobs let's go

If it's beef better move on nigga
Or get shot in the head
Or trucked over by the Yukon nigga (trucked over)
Touch me, lose two arms nigga
You might think you hot
You dead wrong, you just lukewarm nigga
I'm colder than the ice in the freezer
Butcher knife slicin' your caesar
44 blunts, I got a right to amnesia
Late night I'm pipin' a diva
All my niggas hyper and eager
In case I miss the hit, the sniper'll leave ya
This case it's better to give than be the receiver
In the M-6 blowin' the weed up
Comin' through the hood makin' sure that it's G'd up
I'ma I'ma hustler, you know that I re'd-up
My rap is like coke so my shit stay key'd up
Y'all lil niggas new to the slums
I'm from the spot where the dope move faster than the cougar'll run
Come through with a chip, 22 in the bun
Ask the streets who can spit a iller fluid than son
Shiiieet, nobody right? (Nobody)
Kill you, you a nigga nobody like
Fuck with me if you lookin' for the rowdy type
I get it buzzin' with cousin
Six dozen bullets skippin' in the Audi, right
This is Styles nigga
I keep it comin' like gunshots
And you ain't said nothin' in a while nigga

You ain't said nothing, what!?
Motherfucker
Time is money nigga
That's all I'mma say, Poobs we fuckin' out
See you at the finish line, 1
