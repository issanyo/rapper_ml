Turn that shit up diesel
That's poobs ?
I'm a light that shit up
Yeah

I was in the cut these mother fuckers asleep
I'm about the youth these Lil niggas should eat
I been on the streets
I been killing these beats
Give a fuck about no rappers
Cause I been killing ?
Flowing off the RiRi maybe I go and read
Im behind the mask but maybe they know it's me
Type of shit I thought when I was robbin' a thief
I can con a con artist so I'm a problem for me
I can kill any beat don't care if it's R&B
Why he rhyme so ghetto he came from poverty
Look at me then
Look at me now
You Looking around
Cause I'm ghost
On another coast smoking a pound
You will never find a rapper like me
That was rappin' like me
That was clappin' like me
Now I don't wanna brag about no dumb shit
No gun shit, no slum shit
Why the fuck you actin' like me, I don't like that
Left him right there
Talk about, he be right back
Can't spin on me, you ain't doin' the laundry
He goin' come back wit a strap
Arms on me
I attack first if I'm thinking he tryin' to harm me
Work work work work work
Got my Mama in my ear like "the church won't hurt"
But I gotta ride the wave till the surf don't work
Get a new board
Thinkin that the dirt don't work
I'm a true lord
Flip and I slip when I'm high wit da roof off
Gotta stay lukewarm
Nigga put you on could put the Duke on
Flip on yo ass when the loot gone
Dat jewel was free next time bring a coupon
Lookin' at the rob report in the ?
Holdin' on a strap
That could clap and get a moose gone
