[Intro: Jadakiss & Nino Man]
D-Block
Uh, so raspy
Ice Pick forever
Holla, I'm ready

[Verse 1: Nino Man]
Prolly got animals but you don't tame 'em (nah)
When you ride with ya dogs you gotta train 'em (mmm)
'Cause if it get outta hand you can't restrain 'em
Niggas will do dumb shit thinkin' that you gon' save 'em
Now they think you betrayed 'em (facts)
When that bag on the line you gotta play Chess
Doin' niggas dirty for nothin', how you gon' stay fresh?
Heard they pray on my downfall, but I'ma stay blessed
Now it's quiet for them, like they takin' a state test
Don't play in my life, go play Cee-lo
That thing gon' stutta like dutta man, don't play Nino
Niggas run around like goons thinkin' that we know
Until I get 'em clapped on Friday for playin' Deebo!
Cut class but after school wasn't mackin'
When niggas was in after-school I was trappin' (yup)
When you see frauds act a fool, they just actin' (yup)
Nah, we don't scrap with dudes, we just clap 'em (boom)
Niggas hate me cause I floss too much (yup)
But they didn't hate me when it used to cost too much (whoo)
That's why I keep a small circle, people cross too much
Yeah, they was winnin' but they lost their touch
I'M NINO MAN

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Distinctive voice is clearly how most remember me
I'm deep like them Instagram posts from Emory
Blood make you related but I go off energy
Back and fourth with Nino, to show off chemistry
Grown man, I don't bust down my watches
I wear classic pieces, nothin' obnoxious (classic)
Long as the streets need this, nothin' can stop this
Goggles over the skully with the Gucci galoshes
More men than Grammy's, no Oscars
Calamari and Salmon, no Lobsters
Know the big homies, I know mobsters
That cooked up families and hold them hostage
Sign the hit list, just mind ya business
'Cause you know they can't wait to line the witness
The clock might stop but the time is endless
They want us to lose but we designed to win this
Not enough bitches and too many bitch niggas
That's why you gotta leave 'em in a hole, ditch niggas
Too many fake Rico and Mitch niggas
The shoes is your size, they don't fit niggas (they don't fit)
With my own eyes I seen it (I seen it)
Never call a nigga ya friend if you don't mean it
Nah, with my own eyes I seen it
You never call a nigga ya friend if you don't mean it, what?

[Verse 3: Styles P]
I don't do that friend shit, I do fam
Niggas'll go half wit'chu, try to clip the grams
Niggas'll see the blueprint, try to switch the plans
Niggas are addin' two cents, ain't shit to scan
Trust is somethin' you earn
A pussy nigga raw, a handgun is somethin' to burn
Yeah, the code of the streets, well that's somethin to learn
As a youth, like you can't go to jail if they don't got proof
MoÃ«t on the roof, marijuana in the lobby
That's your friend but you can't trust him to catch a body
But you in the Benz 'cause you got similar hobbies
Like similar hoes, like similar parties
That buddy buddy shit'll get you murked in the place
Monkey see, monkey do, don't work with the apes
It's a jungle out here, can't work with the Jakes
Either you get the long things or work with the eights
These niggas is too soft, these rappers is too friendly
The old me, I would've smacked 'em with two Hennys
But now I'm bein' positive
The cognitive skills just seems synonymous, and I'm anonymous
But not behind the keyboard
Violate my homie and get a keloid, now that's a friendship
If we ain't blood, but this is kinship
Violate one of my niggas and I'ma end shit
