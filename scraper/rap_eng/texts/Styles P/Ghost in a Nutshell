[Intro]
Two, two, yeah
Two, two, two, yeah
Two, two, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, two, two, yeah
Oh shit! It's that vibe right here
Shit, I love it

[Verse]
Shouldda been done wit' it but I'm so dumb wit' it
You can pick a rapper then tell him to come get it
Put somethin' in sun fitted, funky like sun shitted
Supposed to be gangstas but they actin' like dumb bitches
Man, got a pound of jungle boys, and my lungs with it
Shout out to Fife, use the beat and have fun wit' it
I'm gon' run wit' it like [?] in a cop chase
You a piece of shit, I outta spit in your [?] face
If you hear me on the stereo, I'm like hood, I'm scenario (I lay buckshots)
Used sell dope on the block, lay buckshot
Smith and Wesson, holdin' a Smith and Wesson
If I can't shoot it out, I'ma teach you a different lesson
Listen up, that's a hawk in your big intestine
Excuse I, I mean the large one (excuse I)
You a piece of shit, matter fact, a large one
These niggas is so dumb, they know that it's redrum when the Ghost come
I just dumped a fifty in a clip and that bitch ready to burn, that's a smoke gun
Now, if you wanna see a smokin' gun or get choked, man, you must be on coke, son
I could do the favor for you 'cause the lasers on the mother fuckin' scope won [?]
Ghost

[Outro]
Ghost
Two, two, two
Yeah, yeah, two, two, two
Ghost, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ghost
Two, two, two
