[Intro]
Noah, what up?
Light that shit up, Poobs

[Verse 1]
Pocket full of weed
Rain full of thoughts and I'm followin' the path with no one in the lead
Things that I see, yeah, no one would believe
As an emcee care about no one in the league
Besides my two brothers, yeah, all of y'all could bleed
If you test me, trust me, none of y'all will leave
I am life force, I am death force
More than a Skywalker, I am on the next course
Whoever's the king shoulda stepped off
I am the God to cut your breath off
Have you ever been to Heaven for your best thoughts?
Or dragged through Hell to get your stress off?
I have, so you can't bypass my next course
Do as I say, don't do as I do
To my son and the Crips and even Piru
Seen a lotta hard niggas and I seen 'em die too
Ghost

[Chorus]
Life come and then death come
Light up the weed and don't stress nothin'
You cross me, I'ma check somethin'
Then wreck somethin'
Then stretch somethin'
Life come and then death come
Light up the weed and don't stress nothin'
You cross me, I'ma check somethin'
Then wreck somethin'
Then stretch somethin'

[Verse 2]
Kill shit, you could call me Thanos Ghost
Underground, gotta keep the manhole closed
From a block, I ain't never had a Bando, yo
Gimmie a band and a O, I go Rambo, yo
That's a rack and a zip
Holiday back, the difference is I ain't got a buncha crack in the whip
Go ahead run, I will let the 'blagh' at your hip
I'm hip to guns fully equipped
I dip in the whip, fully equipped
Light a zip then another one, all of my niggas get ripped
Speakin' of ripped, thinkin' you cheap
Heard your music, think it was weak
You think a rapper better, I hope you thinkin' of Sheek
Or hope you thinkin' of Kiss
If not, then I tell you, "fuck you, I hope you eatin' a dick"
I load the hammer up and have you eatin' the fifth
Ghost

[Chorus]
Life come and then death come
Light up the weed and don't stress nothin'
You cross me, I'ma check somethin'
Then wreck somethin'
Then stretch somethin'
Life come and then death come
Light up the weed and don't stress nothin'
You cross me, I'ma check somethin'
Then wreck somethin'
Then stretch somethin'

[Verse 3]
Life comin' then death comin'
In an M-6, cross me, hear the TEC hummin'
Or the blade cross your neck, cuz'
And I don't give a fuck about your set buzz
I'm old school but I'm so cruel
Plant-based but I will fry your face like it's tofu
Hit 'em in the head and the chest and the toes too
Want the old P? Then just act like the old you, yeah

[Chorus]
Life come and then death come
Light up the weed and don't stress nothin'
You cross me, I'ma check somethin'
Then wreck somethin'
Then stretch somethin'
Life come and then death come
Light up the weed and don't stress nothin'
You cross me, I'ma check somethin'
Then wreck somethin'
Then stretch somethin'
