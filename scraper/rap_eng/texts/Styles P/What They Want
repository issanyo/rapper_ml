[Intro]

Ghost, time is money
D Block, double R
Feel me nigga

[Verse 1]

Usually ride around in a deep thought
The dutchie's will burn
I chose to learn whatever the streets taught
They ain't got respect for a weak boss
Soon as you creep off
They gon' turn your shit into meat sauce
Catch me in the alpha fatigue
Thinking of jail is hell
So I exhale a mouth full of weed
And my man caught a body
Had to bounce on his seeds
Made me drop a tear drop
From the fountain of greed
Say life in the slum is horrendous
Stay in school you gotta keep your gun in attendance
My niggas go numb don't come to the sentence
They hit 'em hard
They gon' hit the yard and straight go for the fences
Spit from the spirit and soul
Hop in the whip
Tell my nigga "Pass some shit I can roll"
I'm kinda loose every now and then i get out control
I might pull it just to see the bullet get out the hole
God damn, am I damned by god?
No remorse when I blam the rod
Rodeo Drive, nigga scan the card
(It's what they want)
You god damn fucking right
The hood is mad, the good get bad
When they see that the truck is right
Make a little cash then them bitches'll suck it right
You should understand, I'm just living the fucking life
Plus I keep a gun on me, hawk work real mean
Ready to die, you know I seen real green
I don't give a fuck if you got a real team
P89, little nigga that's a real beam
The world is mine, faggot that's a real dream
Me vs the top 10, yeah that's a real scene
