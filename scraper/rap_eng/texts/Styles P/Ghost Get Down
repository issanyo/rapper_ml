[Intro]
Let's kill these niggas, fools
Fuck it

[Verse]
Got it popping, got it hitting
He and the mic is like Jordan and Scott Pippen
Stand up nigga, you know that I'm not slipping
If I do, then I'm springing up
We can talk about money if you bring it up
We can buy things if you bring enough
We can get high, then we can get fly
Then high again, bang with me, I will string the leviathan
I'm so hot, I should probably hang with the firemen
So they can cool me off
You're making a movie, I shut the movie off, nigga
On that "chill, change the channel" shit
Styles flip, they don't know how to handle it
They better talk to his management
He seem cool and I don't want to damage him
I'm in something fast with the handling
Yeah, like the speed, I get my handle on
Play me, that will be the block they put the candles on
I'm telling you nigga, how hood is this?
I'm an asshole, and you're an asshole, but
You bitch ass nigga, I ain't full of shit
I'm hoping you get it, you probably won't
You acting like you're tough but the rest of the lobby won't
If you ain't Elliott Wilson, you shouldn't be a yellow nigga
Get ready for the combat, jack
And I might tax these niggas when I'm trying to be a mellow nigga
Imagine Ghost do journalism
Interview all of these rappers and keep the burner with him
Nine in his mask and tell him pop off now
The cash that you're talking 'bout, drop off now
You know the time nigga, take the watch off now
If it's fake, I'ma clean, take the Glock off now
If he say he're hard too, he's just a knock off Styles
Ghost, nigga
