[Intro:]

My Nigga Young Roddy, S P The Ghost
Jet Life D-Block
You already know

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Nigga you lookin' at Kiza Söze,
Zips on Deck, Bricks on deck and Rose'
The young Jet , the old G
Spend on smoke what these niggas spend on for the whole Key
Low key,or High key
Drop a piano on your head if you try me
Or Young Roddy fly in the Maserati
Or the fleet with grow hand for the best look
The work move faster then Russell Westbrook
Kevin Durant on the dope stamp
My niggas pot heads ,but we the most in
I ain't the swag champ, I'm the Lo champ
Come and light it up with the smoke champ
D-Block Jet Life you know both camps
I get it in and I get it out
Pitcher money to me I hit it out

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]

I started smoken' heavy cause times was gettin' Harder
Step brother ?? he left me a revolver
Welcome to me city land of the less fortun
Glenwood Apartment Aka the Carter
Where they dont through ?? they through crosses
Last name Spalding Aka I'm Ballin'
Us against the world, fuck them niggas we a problem
So sucky free sucka niggas pay extortion
Hold on video had rocks in my pocket
Linked up with Dza got a plug up that Sour
Hooked up with Styles now I'm good out in Yonkers
Good in any hood I don't need a Co- signer
My girl on that MOLLY me I'm on the Chronic
Tra 1st and D-Block , real niggas mobbin'
Bet somebody hamma round this bitch got a body
Went from no bottles into bein' a role model

[Verse 3: Smoke Dza]

Righhht

Hit my nigga Rout with Dour
I been that niggas since niggas da Eddie Bauer
A couple days I ran through a 1/4 pounder
Now I'm rolling up some Harlem shake no Baauer
Smell a stench that will wake the whole crowd up
Smokers Club client Founder
Run around Harlem on some Mayor shit
Nigga prob let the AR spit
On the block he do the Grave Yard shift
Stay on it like clock work
We don't prolong we pop first
Put him out like he pops perks
Shout out to my dogs
Three way call from behind the wall
My little homies straped like we goin’ to war
Like fuck it mystery goin’ to get me out in the morn'
Come out with Packs like crack of dawn
Save your profit nigga weather the storm keep hustlin
DZA...
