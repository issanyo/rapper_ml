Beast Music, D block, yea
Nigga, you know

I used to keep money in the shoebox
Knockin if I die, the night from 2 Pac
Or into the stage from buckshot
Dream of the Europeans standing at the bus stop
Headed to a fuck ass stop job
Never seen a fuck boy I would not rob
That's why I thank God for the contracts
Run up with niggas that would push the wig, be your mind back
Reckless, less wreck, less def
Nigga just come up off the necklace
Matter fact, you can keep that
Get the safe ready, know where you sleep at
Hit yo man up, did you peep that?
You don't want me assin with a B fat
Getting in like a key in the keyhole
Leave a nigga dead just for a kilo

[Chorus]
Take it back, tu ru tu tu
Take it back, hey yea yea
Take it back, tu ru tu tu
Take it back
Back
Take it back, tu ru tu tu
Take it back, hey yea yea
I loves the music
I just call it believe in it
Take it back

I used to move the C and the D rock
Knockin every day, struggle from BI
Malcolm, Raekwon and Ghostface, purple tape
On the crib yo, that means I'm working late
New 25, IRS with the snitchers
125th pictures with the fly bitches
That was the days of the Willy murda
Now I'm getting any nigga in the city murdered
European vehicle sippin swerving
914's the call, 911
If I said I'm gonna get you 'cause the time gon come
It ain't Nore or Vado but the Slime gon come
Oozing out yo eyes and yo ears
And I ain't gotta brag, I've been getting money for years
So do you, I'mma do me
But you could fuck around, I'll break yo neck like Bruce Lee

[Chorus]
Fuck what I used to do, tell you what I'm doing now
All I do is make money and move around
It's from around, you know the shooter round
4-5 filled with arrows to put you through the ground
You makin it rain, you throw loot around
Your mom got a dress, hope yo pop got a suit around
Get a candle to circle the whole crew around
Find a nice little spot to boohoo around
'90 P, yea just do it now
The gun is greezed, the shoe's so fluid now
Motherfucker this is beast music
All these rappers is food, I feast to it

Take it back, tu ru tu tu
Take it back, hey yea yea
Take it back, tu ru tu tu
Take it back

My life ever since
Start it now, it's gonna have more meaning girl

Take it back, tu ru tu tu
Take it back, tu ru tu tu
Take it back, tu ru tu tu
Take it back, tu ru tu tu
Take it back, tu ru tu tu
Take it back, tu ru tu tu
Take it back, tu ru tu tu
