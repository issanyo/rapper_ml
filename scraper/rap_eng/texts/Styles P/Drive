[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Dirty ashtrays, empty bottles of champagne
Tryna find my way in this maze, which is the game
Bitches and gold chains, pistols and diamond rings
More than my fair share seen, been on the scene since I seen
Niggas make green, used my common sense it seemed hella easy
But it took a grip a time pimp, believe me
Just wanted to make moves while my dudes was still alive to see me
Do it like I was doin it for TV
Me and 2 Chainz blew hella trees
Take your Maserati, hot as I set em' down on Chevy seats
Love you dealin' wit a G
Your club for audio drugs, 16 bars is a key
1 mixtape is a whole barge, load it down with that sneeze
We record it, we float it in, it's movin' in them streets
The monumental movement got that music for the fiends
Be cautious, this boss shit, be mindful when you speak
Gotta read between them lines to find whats hidden in these beats

[Hook x2: Curren$y]
It ain't what you wear it's what you drive
It ain't what you drive it's where you park
It ain't where you park it's where you live
It ain't where you live it's how you die
It's either how you died or who you killed
Nigga, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
I used to be that nigga stealin' bicycles
Young fly nigga, til' I die I stay live nigga
So stressed out I used to blaze 'til my eyes little
Hella high pimpin' on the corner with them wild niggas
Get rich or die tryin' I got that feelin'
I'm so close to a million, and the Lord is my witness
I swear to God I love her, I'm just bad with commitment
That simply, we smoke 'til them sandwich bags empty
I burn a joint with Jaz, he talked religion
And I ain't attend church in a minute, Lord knows I need to hear this
But I been like a pilot, plottin' on my paper mission
My hustle game official, I used to hoop like Penny
Was flat broke, no pennies, had henney in my system
Big money on my mental, her ass fat as a hippo
Girl watchu' tryna' get into
From a rental, to a hoopty, to a Benzo my nigga
Oww

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Styles P]
It's either how you die or who you killed
Where I'm from, niggas tryna move them pills
Niggas push them wheels, one shot pop in the gills
If you rappin' then I hope you get a deal
Nigga, if its where you live, I'm in the Ritz
In a mansion upstate, I'm the shit
If it's where you park, I don't park - valet parks for me
Team full of shooters on the block that'll spark for me
It ain't what you drive I get drove
Nigga I'm worldwide, across the globe
It ain't what you wear if it was, nigga I wear Nike
Polos and Jordans my whole life and ice
If you ask me it's what you smoke
It it ain't strong get another dose
Ghost - so be careful what you rep
Salute to D-Block and the Jets, whattup

[Hook x2]
