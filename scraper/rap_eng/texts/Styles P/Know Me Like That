Ye don’t know me like that (Ye don’t know me like that)
I catch a hammy like that (I catch a hammy like that)
Ye don’t know me like that (Ye don’t know me like that)
I don’t wanna go back (I don’t wanna go back)
Ye don’t know me like that

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
Ye don’t know me but you heard bout me
Ye don’t know me but you worry bout me
Heard I pull a coroner on a curve robbery
Ye don’t know me but I bet yo bitch do
I only know you from the things that a bitch do
I post bail, no sweat, I’m all promise and you all sweat
Try snitching, get you all wet
My co-defendant gave a statement to the state
He said he kept it real, but he kept it really fake
Hella hate, yella tape
Caught a body, beat the case, celebrate
Not Brawlic, but I’m so Saudic
Shoebox, no wallet, new gun bum, old problems

Like that, like that, like that
Hol’ up, ye don’t know me like that

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Ye Don’t Know Me like that, yeah, homie like that
Leave a mark on his face, why did he blow me like that?
Buck fifty, would be Coby like that
Mean it, I shoot a lot
I used to rock the mansons to get a lil cash
So nice to hit the Buddha spot
You neva knew who you neva know
A lot say they ride but they neva rode
Heavy metal in the console, I need a pedestal
I used to be eager to be ignorant
The block ran from a soul militant
Now I’m coolin’ and livin’ innocent
Ye don’t wanna leave it like that, ye want innocent

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
My worker got robbed, one of my homies got whipped
My lawyer need a payment in child support labor
My Porsche need ties and my Benz need bricks
My plate need potatoes and my stomach need steak
I grind like a slow jam on these streets
AK in the bro hand, no ID, CL, no DLs, top speed
Lights on in the club and I’m still not leavin’
I stash work in money crib, the cream
While my big old chain is slammed in the rib
How a presidential rollie leave ya residential holy
Mind talkin’, got the stake to makin’ it with homies
