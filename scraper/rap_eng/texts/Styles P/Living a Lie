Verse 1
I am the truth
Two parts vermouth
I am vodka and olive juice
But who are you
Who are you

You drink me down
You drink me up
Give you my all
It's not enough
But it makes me wonder

You put on a show
But you ain't so tough
Mad because I know
Would call out your bluff
But you drink me down
You drink me up
So I get you high

But you're living a lie
Said you're living a lie

Verse 2
I see your mask
Through my reflective glass
So excuse me but I gotta ask
Well who is that
Who is that

You look me down
You look me up
I try to give you what you want
But it makes me wonder

You put on a show
But you ain't so hot
Mad because I see
For what you got
But you look me down
You look me up
So I trick your eyes

But you're living a lie
Said you're living a lie

Rap
I know you living a lie
I got G sense
Anything you saying or doing
Is false pretense
Got legs to stand on
But your knees bent
You ain't cool
Can't even be decent

Yeah you real, real fake
Something like a worm or a real snake
You perpetrating and bluffing
Your word is your bond
But your word ain't worth nothing

Yeah you shoulda been a actor
Cause anything you say or do
Couldn't be a factor

So go ahead keep getting by
But remember when you die though
You living lies
