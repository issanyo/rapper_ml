You better pray to God n praise the Lord
All hell break loose when P raise the four
If I'm thinkin bout harmin u
Muthafucka ima squeeze at ya head til I knock out the Orange juice
To tell the truth I'm expecting to die
N like all I can see is death in my eye
Understand that I'm violent prone
Come strapped with the nine n the knife n go wild alone
Ima grown ass man with a child at home
Gotta case right now
So u can get shot in ya face right now
With a ape like style
D block nigga I know it's a drought so if u need to cop work I got weight right now
Sorta like the way of the gun
Ya man looking at me crazy cuz I'm talkin bout laying his son
So here's what I offer you niggas
To shoot out ya eyes so u don't gotta watch while I torture ya niggas
I started off a armed robber
Hustle hard n rose from a soldier all the way to the godfather
Niggas wanna talk about the group split up
Still drunk still high still shoot shit up
Hit u in ya big head with the .38 cal sheek laughing yelling duke get up
Kiss said he finished off brains is gone
So I'm goin in the pockets n the chains is gone
Tryna get more money cuz d block niggas need guns with the lasers on em
To my niggas in the Bing with the razors on em
If a nigga try to front cut him four to five times
This is holiday n I rep organized crime
Stop talking bout the throne leave it alone
Cuz if p comin for it like all of y'all dyin
Then it's back to coat weather
So I'm two guns up with big bullets thata leave a nigga throat severed
