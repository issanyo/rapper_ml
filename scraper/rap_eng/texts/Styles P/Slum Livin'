[Hook 1: Big Remo]
Slum livin’ I been on my shit since ‘96
Wipe my shoulders I’m a soldier made it out the trench

[Verse 1: Big Remo]
Still slammin’ and you youngins on that dummy shit
I live it up true school, [?] stuntin’ shit
Let me squeeze for you jackets tryna run the kid
On everything WS [?] be on they shit
Fightin’ cases like a mobster right in front of them
Often it’s work round the corner from my mama crib
Corner stores like extortion when I’m on the hit
This for your troubles, baby, your token a couple chips
Chip in the engine I could dip in a minute
My bitch pushin’ a rental ran us a couple of pennies
When they dented the Hemi y’all nearly ruined my image
All you haters was hatin’ as if I couldn’t deliver
I ain’t new to this system not cool with Officer friendly
But I offer a service, no servin’ women or children
This a cold world and when I’m in the city I’m chillin’
I’m in the country I’m lunchin’ it’s Big Re in the building

[Hook 2: Big Remo]
Slum livin’ I been on my shit since ‘96
In my tender teens, smokin’ [?] Heineken
Wipe my shoulders I’m a soldier made it out the trench
This might be obvious, I’m on my Sleepwalker shit
Make money money, make money money, money
It go make money money, make money money, money
(You can’t take it from me, Reezy I’m still summin’, yea)

[Verse 2: Ransom]
Been slummin’ since ’86 I made hundreds to play the strip
I made a grip and spent like most of my bread on the latest kicks
I paint a pic if niggas faces is blurry I change the script
I’m Taratino sip [?], y’all niggas ice tea
Undercover befrieindin’ Nino, I get a ton a kilo
From the border I put that word on my daughter
Get the order if it’s COD I gotta applaud ya
That’s cash on delivery, rappers try and mimic me
I’m clinically the best nigga spittin’ check out my synergy
The world famous still grippin’ that pearl [?]
Load a clip, point at your memory tree, that nigga like Kennedy
Word to my enemy, make ya niggas remember me
Identically resembling God, niggas repent to me
[?] one song always keepin’ my gun warm
Record a blessing, I torch a session, word to my unborn

[Hook 2]

[Bridge: Ransom]
I been on my shit too Remo
It’s that shit right here Ka$h
Let’s get some cash
Heinekens

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Slum livin’ I been on my shit since ‘96
Maybe it was ‘86 I always did some crazy shit
But back in 9-6 I would fly bricks
I-95 rida, make a nigga mind drift
I’m on Bad Boy, why I wanna fly bricks
I shoulda been home, that Montana syndrome
But Tony in a nigga blood
Then the one tiger, the Porche, the mansion, nigga what
Versace shirt, Versace shoes
I’mma get this money I don’t care what Akhi do
Back then I had an ignorant attitude
But TVs in the truck'll make them hood niggas mad at you
Condos with the flat screen
Drug dealer rap kings, wild boys that clap things
If it’s white in the square than I wrap things
I thank God that I made it out back then
