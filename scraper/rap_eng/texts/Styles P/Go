[Verse 1: Styles P]
They say money can buy friendship
I get high and just listen to Jimi Hendrix
I kill you and your henchmen
Shot from your head to your fuckin' appendix
I know it's money over friendship
Brothers over money or everything is senseless
I do it for my niggas sentence
Left me speechless, couldn't say a sentence
Niggas relentless 'cause they rent-less
Still gonna move that weight, like the bench press
Catch me in N-O quarters, yeah, the French shit
That's where the hotel's at, I'm in the ward though
Catch me in the New York streets, I'm like the lord though
Not Christ like
Nigga trife like
I get'chu merc'd on the right night
Where your money at, what the dice like?

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Don't you know?
It's money over bitches every time
I'ma get it, I'ma fill it
I'm gonna go, go, go!
Ay, I'm smokin' and I'm chokin' on that bomb ass shit
And you know we gonna blow, blow, blow!
If you ain't 'bout the money you better get it
On your marks, get set, better go, go, go!
And, yo, it's money over bitches every time
And we gon' get it and you know we gettin' dough, dough, dough

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Rolled up
Hopped out
Had something rolled up that I brung from my house
Where the best shit at? That reserve stock
Not for everybody, don't even pass it 'round
My eyes low, motherfucker, I know
Go stand somewhere over there, hoe!
All of that talkin', bitch I'm sparkin'
This OG have a nigga higher than a hawk in here
VIP couch, no, I don't wanna walk no where
Smoke signals, anywhere I went to
Real nigga smoke a whole pound in your venue
5-star restaurant, wreck the whole menu
New shit that my mans just sent through
Tranquilizer dank like the sandman hit you
Unravelin' your whole mental
Spitta make it right like a pencil

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Don't you know?
It's money over bitches every time
I'ma get it, I'ma fill it
I'm gonna go, go, go!
Ay, I'm smokin' and I'm chokin' on that bomb ass shit
And you know we gonna blow, blow, blow!
If you ain't 'bout the money you better get it
On your marks, get set, better go, go, go!
And, yo, it's money over bitches every time
And we gon' get it and you know we gettin' dough, dough, dough

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
To the finish line
Gettin' this money, nigga, it's like a marathon
Money you protect, nigga, it's where you get buried on
Every day it go down
Nigga, the chopper like a mother fuckin' merry-go-round
Spin you backwards, screamin'
The gat'll flip you around
Stiff your ass on a mattress
Beats when I attack this
Comin' with the spirit that a ghost say
Who them niggas that they lovin' they hatin' they lovin' most
Notorious, explain the history of this
Money makin' is ours for the takin'
Bullseye, no mistaken
Audi like five G's, I'll Flava Flav you
[?] is a fucked up behavior
Savior
Comin' to redeem, shatter your dreams
With a scene of miss reality, scoop you out with the beam
I'll lay you flat out
They says that's what them crazy niggas is all about, no doubt

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
Don't you know?
It's money over bitches every time
I'ma get it, I'ma fill it
I'm gonna go, go, go!
Ay, I'm smokin' and I'm chokin' on that bomb ass shit
And you know we gonna blow, blow, blow!
If you ain't 'bout the money you better get it
On your marks, get set, better go, go, go!
And, yo, it's money over bitches every time
And we gon' get it and you know we gettin' dough, dough, dough
