[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
To be honest man, I'm the kind of fan
I thought of rap as a quarterback in the promiseland
I was fit to be leadin’ teams to a victory
I was picked to be All-Pro, I sure flow
Let me break down the name of the game
And explain all the rules, 'cause y'all ain’t playin' the same
No Live, but I came with a cane and two Gs when I came in
Tryin' to get my name in the game
The hood that I claim's where Fame and them came
And cats got robbed if they came in them chains (Stick 'em up)
Ain't much changed but the size of the guns
We're still on the rise for the funds, tryin' to make a buck
Green paper with the face of oppressors
And still gotta wait for our blessings, that’s no mistake
We in the paper chase, there’s no escape
Destined to die with no estate, and so I wait
For the chance of a lifetime that I might shine
Be a millionaire, but I'm not usin’ a lifeline (No)
I see right through it, like white wine
This is sacred ground and y'all runnin' the pipeline (What?)
Tryin' to funnel in these frauds and front ’em in
I was right there with a blank stare when you brought 'em in
Man this shit is competetive
And your best what you better give, can't let 'em live

[Chorus]
Yo I'm sure there's more than what you were playin' for
Life's pain, gotta try to withstand more
Feel the power and try to follow the man law
Count your blessings and learn the lessons of man law
Yeah, yeah, learn the lessons of man law
Feel the power and try to follow the man law
There's rules to this shit
I live and die by the code and that's as real as it get, yeah

[Verse 2: Styles P]
He's Masta Ace, I'm master deuce (Get it?)
Throw up the peace, pass the juice (Peace)
I could drop knowledge or love, pass the doob (What up)
But on the flipside there's pain if you's a bastard, too (You's a bastard)
I am the ghost, yeah, that's my attribute (Ghost)
My mouth is a gun, yeah, my lyrics blast the booth (Yeah, blast the booth)
In your eardrums, you don't hear sun'n, you don't fear none (You don't hear sun'n)
Rough enough to make a fuckin' bear run (Rrrah)
Marco Polo on the beats (Yes), I be dolo with the heat
'Cause I'm goin' to the body like Cotto on his feet
In his prime, yeah I rhyme, but the nine is in the Jeep
'Cause you gotta know the time to get you lined up in these streets (Gotta know the time)
But not me, no, not me (Not me)
It's a lot of wack rappers, but not P (Uh uh)
Beat 'em in his legs, make him knock-knee (Woof)
My hood is iced out, no hockey (Hahaha)
Eatin' raw plants and roll papers (Zags)
Hustlin' to get more paper
More stores and more acres (More acres)
Let the people catch more vapors (Vapors)
Word to Biz, I done made my mark (My word)
Got in the game, had to play my part (Haha)
Like God, dim had to play the dark (I can see)
Came out shinin', what a way to spark

[Chorus]
Yo I'm sure there's more than what you were playin' for
Life's pain, gotta try to withstand more
Feel the power and try to follow the man law
Count your blessings and learn the lessons of man law
Yeah, yeah, learn the lessons of man law
Feel the power and try to follow the man law
There's rules to this shit
I live and die by the code and that's as real as it get

[Outro]
That- that's as real as it get
That's- that's as real as it get
I l- I- I l- I live and die by the code and that's- that's
That- that's as real as it get
That's- that's- that's
That's as real as it get
I live- I- I live-
I live and die by the code and that's as real as it get

[Skit]
Marco, what the hell?
I just talked to your mom
And I really can't believe you
You just decided to take off and leave?
For what, for that stupid-ass hip-hop dream of yours?
You remember the last time that we talked
And I told you
If you did this, it's gonna be the end of us?
So when you get there
Your dreams get crushed
Don't even think about crawling back to me
Because trust me
I'm not going to be waiting for your ass
Bye
