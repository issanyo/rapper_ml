I should call myself the biggest bitch
Everything I did was based on it
I'd like to call you without an aim
Life is flat routine's always the same
GAPS AND DIFFERENCES WON'T MEAN A THING
I'm like you make me love again
SMART AND BEAUTIFUL OR WHAT IT BRINGS
So soon take me to the end of time
BEING POSSESSED IS THE ONLY NEED
You're the ONLY NEED
EVERYTHING SHE SAID
I don't care about the things you do
I just want to spend the night with you
May we spill ourselves upon a couch
Doing experience on things we're about?
