And my heart beats.. ( X 8 )
Alone tonight
Stars shining bright
And I dream that you're beside me
I wait for you...
What can I do?
Heaven knows if only he loved me

And my heart beats
Just like a drum
And my heart beats
It goes boom, boom, boom
And I'm pleading you won't let me go
You started this desire
And my heart beats
Just like a drum
And my heart beats
It goes boom, boom, boom
And I'm pleading you won't let me go
You started this desire

And my heart beats
Just like a drum
And my heart beats
It goes boom, boom, boom
And I'm pleading you won't let me go
You started this desire

Feeling the heat
My body's weak
In my world your love surrounds me
I wonder why
We have begun
Won't you put your arms around me?

And my heart beats.. ( X 8 )
And my heart beats
Just like a drum
And my heart beats
It goes boom, boom, boom
And I'm pleading you won't let me go
You started this desire
And my heart beats
Just like a drum
And my heart beats
It goes boom, boom, boom
And I'm pleading you won't let me go
You started this desire
