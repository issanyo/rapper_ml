Yeah my niggas, just spend a little bit of time with the ghost
Holiday, styles, pinero, well you listen to me
Real niggas feel me, some real nggaz probably won't feel me
But as you know me, I don't really give a fuck
Before I leave I'd like to give a word to the shorties
Despite what I say, despite what you see in the streets
Dspite what you influenced by, the life of crime has many downs
A little bit of ups, and everything you do got consequences and repercussions
So you're best bet better be to stay in school
Hit the books, stay off the streets if possble
To those on the streets, who feel stuck in the game
To those in jail, thats just how shit goes sometimes
We make do wit what we got
To all mc's, poets, lyricists, people such as myself, ghostly individuals
You should listen to my album, and listen and listen and listen
I dont know what i'ma sell or none or that shit
I would say i dont give a fuck but i'd probably be lying
I love to get money and break it down wit my niggas
But in case i don't, the most important thing is respect and honor
And i got plenty of that, so until sheek lou child, next l.o.x. album
And all the mtherfucking rest of the albums we do from the double R
To the d block, to anybody else whose our motherfucking family putting down an
Album, we gon crush yall motherfuckers
Well this one is the ghost, my lil niggas stay outta trouble
My big niggas who in trouble, hold ya head and everybody in the motherfucking
Struggle, I love you and if you love me
Shit i'll see you when I get there, One
