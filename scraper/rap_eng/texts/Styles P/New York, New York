[Intro]
It seems so hard to find a friend, to find a friend in the New York city!
Yo, yo! New York, New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York, New York

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Make it here, make it anywhere, yeah
It's that deep and it’s hard to have a dream in the city that never sleeps
The Apple is rotten, but so is the worm in it
Named the city twice, gotta double up to earn in it
Ain't nothing is faster than a New York Minute
So I wear a white T with a blue Authentic
Fitted hat with the NY letters
I get high, gotta be a high roller for NY cheddar
And the statue winked at me when I met her
Babe it cost to be a New York boss, Teflon don
Still toast to B.I.G. in the Benz, blow chron chron
Bright lights and dim fog
Fat chances, slim odds, niggas I’ll get your men robbed
And I been on the streets, so I been hard
Fuck what you bought and who you fought
What you thought, nigga this New York, New York

[Hook]
New York, New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York, New York

[Verse 2: Saigon]
Look, not only is the hip hop birth place
Is where they bury you that scenario is the worst case
At your burial nigga show up and you and curse Ace
Put a gun in a nigga that’s driving the hearse face
Give us that bastard in the casket, or get hurt, mate!
And God making us shake, we be making the earthquake
I used to ride my bicycle past John Gotti
Looking at him, wondering when was his last body?
Started busting a shotty, but my nose was mad snotty
Before hoes was hoe, back when they was hotty
Remember Styles out in YO wildin' out house party
And now vermin niggas trying to come and jump Jabari
I take you to the city of New Burg
Where everybody ain’t packing, just at least two thirds
That’s true, word
Or we can walk down the hill on Brownsville
So many gunshots, they don’t even sound real
Still, I love New York, there’s where I come from
And it ain’t all bad homie, we have dumb fun
And we’re chilling the two zero one, one
So learn from us and quiet the riots in London

[Hook]

[Bridge: Jared Evan]
It’s the city with the bright lights
And you can get it for the right price
And you can gave it like that, if you want it like that
Only in New York!
It’s a party every day and night
And everybody is invited
So you can have it like that, if you have it like that
Only in New York! New York City!

[Hook]
