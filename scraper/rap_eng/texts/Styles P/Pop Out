This ain't something for the radio
This ain't something for the radio
This is for the niggas like me that's lettin' the 3-80 go
With the model chick that love to act a felatio
Bullet to your body, I know the exact ratio
Come from the soul like pasta noose and macyo
Plug 1, plug 2, plug 3
Rip slow, 1 slug, 2 slug, 3
On the block, drug 1, drug 2, drug 3
Epitome at heart, balls in delivery
It's hard to the day niggas is giving me the god
And if Satan waitin'
I try to kill him, no debatin' hatin'
I'm on all like my niggas elevatin'
Kinda fascinatin'
You down bitch? Or you in the cell masturbatin'?
Soul assassination, either you get it or you don't get it
Either you will or you won't, with the smell smoke ghost lit it
If it's a lockout, we gon hop out
We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out
If it's a lockout, we gon hop out
We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out
Nustso, schizo, go for the gusto
Bounce when it blitz though, house of the rich though
I didn't wanna die from the balls of the pistol
Lie, keep a nigga brain fired like Crisco
Niggas wanna shine like the ball at the disco
Want that money long like a headline of frisco
It's not the young boys or the OG's that get you
Yea a bullet might, but a missile won't miss you
D block on me but we went and enlist you
We all ball but we wanna assist you
I don't ref but got stripes and I'm official
Never been got but my nigga I get you
If it's a lockout, we gon hop out
We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out
If it's a lockout, we gon hop out
We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out
Money coming and going fast but the weed burn slow
Other niggas will die but their seeds gon grow
Yea I move H, you kept the G from the dough
I will lay a nigga down with the 4
Or any caliber gun that's in my hands
Defend my land and defend my mans
I ain't the judge but recommend you stand
Cuz I'm your honor when they move guns and grams
If it's a lockout, we gon hop out
We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out
If it's a lockout, we gon hop out
We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out
