[Verse 1]
Green money and green weed, black hoodies and black guns
White coke and white dope gettin' sold under the yellow sun
Red gangs and blue gangs, but most of 'em got brown faces
You can tell if the sky is gray, look at the niggas in the town's faces
Forget the colors, do the numbers
Twenty for a brick, but if you caught, it's twenty-five summers
Just one more nigga that they put under
Keepin' a hundred, you still riskin' it
Stand still, I use Fox shots to keep distancin'
Either one love, or it's too much hate
Three months OT and that's DuPont cake
But either niggas is for you, or you got eight
A-T-E, don't be the one to get R-A-P-E-D
You can still get a degree wit' a GED
You should stay up off the streets, they don't love you, B
Yeah, rough like a winter wit' no coat
Boys lookin' like girls, so it's women wit' no hope
If we ain't got weed, what the fuck we gon' smoke?
If we ain't got money, then fuck it, we go broke
Came from nothin', nigga, then we got much more
And much more and much more
So give me a reason to give a fuck, fool
If you don't say, "Family", I say, "Fuck you"
