[Verse 1: Saigon]
I could be parallel to bad as hell
Equivalent to ignorant
Depends on the matter, well, if it's that insignificant
I'll just have to tell a nigga to kick rocks with flip flops
Rapper rather tell than sit in a cell to snitch hop
I ain't paying to disc jock, he ain't getting the wrist-watch
I'm the realest to make it, he takin dick in the shit box
I kinda get why I'm legit, mostly to the folks who think dominant
I see why dishonest shit is so prominent
See the kids that's rhymin' it, that ain't lived not a line of it
You ain't hood money not good money ya counterfeit
The kind of vagin I get on some Lola Falana shit
Interstate 95'ing it, with that coke and them llamas, bitch
Hold up, what time is it? The clock strike ten
I guarantee none of y'all be on the block like him
Cock the fifth back you get baffled, click clack, you skedaddle
Lot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them
The record labels are scared of me, Internet gotta bag me
First they said I was gangsta, then they said 'not exactly'
I rap about politicians, I rap about Pataki
The loser maneuvers of Edgar Hoover reenacted
Being I'm on my black shit, they be trying silence me
But to do that shit, they'll have to do it violently
Clack clack that mack back
Rat-at-at-at-at
A lot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them

[Verse 2: Styles P]
A lot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them
Y'all niggas is lukewarm, y'all ain't hot like them
Them motherfuckers my brothers, they are not my friends
We the band with the bond, from grams on the arm
A lot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them
Y'all niggas is lukewarm, y'all ain't hot like them
Them motherfuckers my brothers, they are not my friends
We the band with the bond, from grams on the arm
The uncut dope, ya had to land on the farm
Rapping on arenas, rubberbands to the mobs
Getting high to Sinatra, in the sands of the palms
Reminiscing on rapping with BIG, the man was a don
Niggas did it big, but not like them
Drink champange in the ocean just to drown my sins
Shit I pray when valet, pull around my Benz
These niggas know my beginning, but not my end
Yeah
It's me and Saigon and the paesans
Network behind us like we Verizon
Go ahead and chill out, get your vibe on
Cause this could be the day that you died on
