[Hook x2: Joffy]
Bomb weed, bomb weed, stick a move
Kick, push, bite nigga, make a move
Cut, shoot, stab niggas, make a move
This is bloodsport nigga, we don't play with rude's

[Verse 1: Frenchie]
Fight, kick, stab nigga, bust a move
Yellow tape, paramedics, make the news
We from New York, Brooklyn type, where the Lakers lose
From Ninja Turtle's before ?
Papa had a lot of spots, we ain't move
Now it's up to me, to pick and choose
I'm Pokemon, bullets faster than Pikachu
You hiding out, well these boys they peek-a-boo
I see you, you should've had it cocked back
If you be snitching on niggas, you gonna drop fast
? yeah I keep that Tec on the dresser
No air compressors, but my shit'll stress you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Bloodsport, I like blunts and throw slugs off
Nobody realer, got dealers to knock my drugs off
You from a set, but half of your set is dumb soft
More pussy, more money, and more pussy
Bob and weave like money made in Pacman
Stab niggas to death, or pull a gat man
Your man's gon' end up in the trash can
He's garbage, and your garbage
So you and him together, that's too garbage
I keep a few guns and kill a few artists
Yeah, fuck around and get a slug ?
SP the ghost, D-Block, bloodsport

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joffy]
Sell 'em a whole deck, go 'head make a move
Hope on hold back, go 'head and make the news
Harlem remain fly, softer than ? shoes
Fuck the law, when it come to that gun play
In broad day light, he get shot and tucked away
I'm born to be a leader, always move with that heater
Promethazine in my right hand, pour up two liters
Got no time for the nonsense, the flow here is god sent
The shotty' blast will spread quicker than gossip
Lay 'em down like carpet, I spit that hard shit
I been moving butter, no margarine
This bloodsport here, I'm talking

[Hook]
