Akon…Styles P
Konvict…Konvict…Konvict

Feel This One Kon
Please Tell Me It's over

Verse 1
(Styles P)

I'm in the streets where the soldiers stay
You can talk about getting fresh with people where they close for days
You can roll in a nice whip, we be rolling haze
Maintained in the game, and I'm so amazed
Only Jews that we got was advice
From the brothers that been through it
But I can ask my mother she's been through it
Back home in Africa where the struggle is real
I can say my blood line is spectacular
But it's a sin and I don't know my kin
I'm a ghost don't know my beginning know my end
Yo Konvict calm my soul pray that I live
& I hope the lord forgive me for all of my sins

Chorus
(Akon)

Saw my life I could fight like a solider
Hustling was another mode a
That I can use to survive
Even though they said it ain't right
So tell me where were you when those nights got colder
The day I thought that it was all over
As you can see I survived
Made the best of My Life

Verse 2
(Styles P)

I'm a man so I shed tears
For my homies in the jail and my dead peers
Lot of blood dropped the police the red years
Don't show, cold sores, so the feds here
A lot of gangsters in my town like the Greb there
Outside all night cause it's red there
Want to beef, forget invest, get headgear
This is the town where you get down
And drown nobody tread here

I swear to god that I'm telling the truth
Was a felon when I fell in the booth
They want me to feel
Like I was feeling I was scared of the truth
Yo Kon turn me up so I can give them the proof

Chorus
(Akon)

Saw my life I could fight like a solider
Hustling was another mode a
That I can use to survive
Even though they said it ain't right
So tell me where were you when those nights got colder
The day I thought that it was all over
As you can see I survived
Made the best of My Life

Verse 3
(Styles P)

I said I'm man enough to cry
I ought to let you know that I 'm man enough to die
War for the cause when I do
21 salute, can into the sky
Have it for the drought when the grams gon' get high
My friends are saying your man gon' get high
Slide in the five just to gon' get a buy (LIIIIIIIIFE)
Sixth gear, 200 trying to die on the ride
Now I can outlaw, still arise, trunk full of pies

Chorus 2x
(Akon)

Saw my life I could fight like a solider
Hustling was another mode a
That I can use to survive
Even though they said it ain't right
So tell me where you were when those nights got colder
The day I thought that it was all over
As you can see I survived
Made the best of My Life
