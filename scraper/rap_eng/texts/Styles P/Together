[Chorus: Styles P]
Me and this badass bitch comin' together
Always got a plan to get money comin' together
Handgun and the clip comin' together
Shit is comin' together
Shit is comin' together, yeah
Me and this badass bitch comin' together
Always got a plan to get money comin' together
Handgun and the clip comin' together
Shit is comin' together
Shit is comin' together, yeah

[Verse 1: Styles P]
You know it's comin' together
In the crib playin' Run DMC, Tougher Than Leather
In the slums if you fuck wit' a G, tuck the Baretta
Tell your girl and mom, "Hold my dick, suck it together"
Real nigga, you know it, fuck it, whatever
Holdin' the metal, I'ma be ghetto forever
Got the gun and the clip, blunt and some licks
Me and my bitch in the crib and we cummin' together
Me and the plug made a plan, now we runnin' together
You don't like 'em? I don't like 'em, we could gun 'em together
Then pray for our soul and get blunted together
But when it come to money, I'ma probably want it forever
What?

[Chorus: Styles P]
Me and this badass bitch comin' together
Always got a plan to get money comin' together
Handgun and the clip comin' together
Shit is comin' together
Shit is comin' together, yeah
Me and this badass bitch comin' together
Always got a plan to get money comin' together
Handgun and the clip comin' together
Shit is comin' together
Shit is comin' together

[Verse 2: Chris Rivers]
Go-getter, flow for the cold chedda
Dome shredder, chrome'll get hollow like cold chedda
On Feta, Gouda, that Meunster, that Mozzerella
Butter spreader off of the bread and the love for weather
Women in fancy cars, rappin' in [?]
Happily fallen far as it happens, it's mad [?]
Rappin' like average stars
Tackin' like Padawons
My team Obi-Wan Kenobi, some Yodas and Paragons
Riches like Babylon
Bitches, they tag along
All talk, no walk, nigga, just babble on
Move 'em, we like inertia
Move and we might just hurt ya
Kinetics, you get beheaded
We find your threads when the dirt's dug

[Chorus: Styles P]
Me and this badass bitch comin' together
Always got a plan to get money comin' together
Handgun and the clip comin' together
Shit is comin' together
Shit is comin' together, yeah
Me and this badass bitch comin' together
Always got a plan to get money comin' together
Handgun and the clip comin' together
Shit is comin' together
Shit is comin' together

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Always got a plan to get money comin' together
Niggas clap, I don't mean hands comin' together
It's arm, leg, leg, arm, head if you measure
The depth of the jewels I kick, call it a treasure
Fight The Dark Knight, not Hardy or Ledger
Born a criminal, not hardly a beggar
I beg for drama, you'll beg for mercy
Eyes lookin' grimey or hungry and thirsty
God gave me a gift knowin' the Devil cursed me
Waitin' up for Karma, knowin' she wanna merc me
'Til then, I guess we still runnin' together
Life's a bitch, I'm fuckin' her, we cummin' together
Yeah

[Chorus: Styles P]
Me and this badass bitch comin' together
Always got a plan to get money comin' together
Handgun and the clip comin' together
Shit is comin' together
Shit is comin' together
Me and this badass bitch comin' together
Always got a plan to get money comin' together
Handgun and the clip comin' together
Shit is comin' together
Shit is comin' together
