I just wanna get high and get this money
That's it, real simple, right?
Shit

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Trapped a fly they clipped my wings
..... (?) back, I'm a God, not a king
Tell these rap niggas I'm a God, not a king
Do this shit for niggas in the yard and the bing (?)
Homie in the whole hustlin handlin' feinds
You can handle a dream, you can handle a cream
But when you get rich banana clip with the beam
Chanel on my chick cause Santa was never seen
Now you can ride the bench or be the man of the team
Yeahh
Me? I like the GM spot, BM drop, the PM pop
AM2, so I'm goin' need that AMG in grey and blue
But they said it don't come with a clutch, I'll pass
Eatin' rappers food in they ... (?) so I'll fast
A lotta niggas said they was nice so I'll laugh
Really want a problem with Styles then I'll blast

[Hook: Styles P & Flowboy Vegas]
I just wanna get high, I just wanna get fly
I just wanna make a lot of money, let me get mine
Told you I was gangsta, showed you I was gangsta
This is how it goes when you roll around with gangstas
I just wanna get high, I just wanna get fly
I just wanna make a lot of money, let me get mine
Told you I was gangsta, showed you I was gangsta
This is how it goes when you roll around with gangstas

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Summer is comin', they gon' front
When it comes to the hammers, you know that they gon' dump
It comes to the work, you know that they gon' pump
Niggas say they hittin' homers, you know that they gon' bunt
Niggas say they touchin down, you know that they gon' punt
Niggas actin' so tough, you know that they old cunts
Right around July, I should leave for the whole month
Niggas always say its love, ain't show you no love once
Back to these rappers and all of these ghost writers
You remind of a broke ass lighter, no fire
Fuck it though, get your money up, get your credit up
Out here, either you the pray or the predator
Life .... (?), they ain't shit about the editor
Be foul, get your piece of the pie America
I'm just havin' a little Ghost talk
Sometimes I get high and let the smoke talk

[Hook: Styles P & Flowboy Vegas]
I just wanna get high, I just wanna get fly

I just wanna make a lot of money, let me get mine
Told you I was gangsta, showed you I was gangsta
