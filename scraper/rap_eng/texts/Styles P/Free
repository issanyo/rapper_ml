[Verse 1: Berner]
Six cribs, I put 'em in my kid's name
Eighteen wheeler, play with big rig
I wake up early, go and get paid
Why you takin' pictures of your jewelry if your shit fake?
We live a life that most can't relate to
All the women and the weed, yeah, I'm thankful
And when you're doing good then they hate you
Stay true to the game, don't let it change you
Three joints to the head, I'm on straight Gin
One time for the homies in the state pen
Ride the Rolls-Royce like its stolen
Cut down in October, leave my whole crop frozen
Bitches choosey but I ain't got time
Stash spot got a new Glock nine
Cadillac, limo tint, all black
Why they mad at me? 'Cause they can't bounce back
I took a five piece and doubled that two times
My O.G. plug let me [?] when I switch lines
California weed smoke
And if you hatin' on Bern, you can kiss the Desert Eagle

[Hook: Berner]
Switch lanes, yeah I drive with my knee
I'm in the fast lane rolling my tree
Top down, I'm enjoying the breeze
They like Bern, what's the number for me?
(But ain't nothin for free)
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
(But ain't nothin', but ain't nothin')
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
But ain't nothin' for free

[Verse 2: Styles P]
From dope boy to juice boy
Five-hundred keys on that block get you a new toy
But ain't nothin' for free
You screwed up like the plug ain't fuckin' with me
But you don't need a plug if you are the plug
Lord knows we work hard enough
On the strip tearing that product up
I was twelve years old selling narcotics, bruh
Switch lanes, yeah, I drive with my knee
Take a puff, hit the clutch, ever ride with a G?
'Bout to vacate, know I'm goin slide with a P on a boat
Tryin' float with the piranhas and eat
Suckas wanna see a nigga fail
And those crackas building a bigger jail
A shark can't fuck with a killer whale
Name gon' ring like the bells out of Philladel'

[Hook: Berner]
Switch lanes, yeah I drive with my knee
I'm in the fast lane rolling my tree
Top down, I'm enojying the breeze
They like Bern, what's the number for me?
(But ain't nothin for free)
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
(But ain't nothin', but ain't nothin')
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
(But ain't nothin' for free)
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin for free

[Verse 3: Styles P & Berner]
That's the workers on the block that was pumpin' for me (go 'head)
(Ain't nothin, ain't nothin' for free)
That's the shooters with a strip that was dumpin' for me (please do)
(Ain't nothin, ain't nothin' for free)
Couple niggas turned they back and they was frontin' on me (couple niggas)
(Ain't nothin, ain't nothin' for free)
Word to the grow that sent the smoke that had it jumpin' for me
That's true
Everything come with a fee
A buncha hand-outs but they ain't gettin' nothin' from me
I sold coke, went broke, went dark, no hope
Late night, on the hype in a brand new grow
I'm havin' flashbacks of a sold-out show
Brown bag money, yeah, that's all I know
I'm doing ninety in my S-Class, no hands on the wheel
I'm pullin' buds out my headstash

[Hook: Berner]
Switch lanes, yeah I drive with my knee
I'm in the fast lane rolling my tree
Top down, I'm enojying the breeze
They like Bern, what's the number for me?
(But ain't nothin for free)
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
(But ain't nothin', but ain't nothin')
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
Ain't nothin', ain't nothin' for free
But ain't nothin' for free
