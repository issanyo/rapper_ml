[Wyclef]
Yeah, Sizzla, Clef (Yo, yeah)
Styles, man we need you on this right here (Burning fire)

Yo I got my second wind
I got my second wind
I battle you for you two door four door
Bulletproof xform
Flow blow like c4
See you on the sea floor
Shop for the sea charts
Panic and you see God
Nigga see me in a battle
That's like seeing the face of God
Now you wanna shoot at the dread
So I gotta think for you
'Cause I'ma leave you brain dead
Taught my daughter how to shoot
They say I gon too far
Tell ya daughter don't talk to strangers
They snatch you in a car
I'll be damn if I ain't bulletproof
The Hummer Son of Sam come out the summer
Shoot at my windshield wipers
So kids don't trust that man in the park
Rocka wear G Unit's on, but he a narc

[Styles]
He a narc
Since he won't stop too
Your best stress every one of us
Clef, Sizzla, Styles gotta put the gun to us
They don't like us, how the hell
They gon' govern us?
Tell our kids they all came from some strugglers
Things is real, but you need a reminder
You think of diamonds I think of Hotel Rwanda
Black genocide, black men'll die
What we all need is black enterprise
Let the king have his land
Let the queen raise the fam
Let the seeds grow to be what they wanna be
Let me blow the weed that's in front of me
Rock with me, Sizzla and Clef
And blow a hundred trees

[Sizzla]
Come rock with me
I got the music on the block with me
Come chill on the spot with me
And just let things be
Yeah you're right, we got enough for everyone
So gather your friends and your families
And come along
Move to the beat that's how we do it
Like Jerusalem
Everyday we offer praises like King Solomon
Ain't gon hurt you, don't be nervous
I'm your guardian angel, know your purpose
And if I look at you low, if I should make it
Believe me, lead you, show you how to make it
Stupid things cost your life, don't lose it
Freedom is the greatest, whoo
We got to do this
Jah say love I, love I don't care who it is
People from all walks of the life listen the music
People dying everyday, mothers crying everyday
Bullets flying everyday, damn it's outrageous
And we don't need that, oh oh
Try to be your same
Drop it ah your pain
Just our brains
Gonna save us

Arma-ged-deon
