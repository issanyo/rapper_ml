[Intro:]
Yeah
It’s got that crank to it yeah
Dyce talking that shhh...it (that’s that shit)
Yea

[Verse 1:] [Styles P]
Blunts or papers I might use both
Bombs and vapers until I choke
Smoke till I croak so I’m on that floor
I won Bugs Bunny money and that’s all folks
Smoke all day, falling asleep
I stood awoke all day, get to the bread
I go for broke all day, come from the hood
Where they move coke all day and we toak in hallways
7 grams in the dutchie tho
Expiring the vics acting like nuckie tho
Boss of the mob, I ain’t really lucky tho
Thinking of life and they praying they let Buckie go
Heaven got a ghetto for G’s I know Fats there
Lighting a fat one just thinking of last year
Praying and a hope all day tryna cope all day, you know what em do

[Chorus:] [Dyce Payne]
I smoke all day
Just to see if I can blow my problems away
But I’m still here
I smoke all day
Just to see if I can blow my problems away
I’m still here

[Verse 2:] [Styles P]
Gotta OC Imma light myself
No wifeys or homies ride by myself
Now what I’m going do I’m beside myself
I never had wings but I can fly myself
I’m B.I, I’m ready to die myself
I’m the weed man, I could just supply myself
Roll papers and some bamboo sheets
We can meet at high noon under these random streets
I smoke all day
Hitting the strain from west coast all day
Yeah I’m a playa but I can coach all day
Got me a pound but hit the roach all day
Tryna float all day
We clad when P pop up
Armoured vest will stay the same like the G5 truck
We got now, and we got next
So you know what we saying when we light up

[Chorus] [Dyce Payne]

[Verse 3:]
Sometimes it gets lonely
Smoking on kush girl
No shorty to hold me
Sometimes I might see myself
Cause only I know me[x2]
Low key
Probably got a pound or an O.D
So she
Raised up [?]
Now I’m co-zy
Hope I don’t get pulled by the po-lice
See I’m in the game and I’m so deep
Knee deep
Me, [?] now that’s three feet
Niggas listen up when we speak
On top of the game and you be-neath
Roll up the leaf and let me cheef
Cheef
Cheef

[Chorus] [Dyce Payne]

[Outro:]
Ooooohhh
Roll up the leaf and let me cheef
Oooooohhh
Roll up the leaf and let me cheef
Ooooohhh
Ro Roll up the leaf and let me cheef
Ooooohhh
Ro Ro Roll up the leaf and let me cheef [echoes]
