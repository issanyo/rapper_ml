Chorus

Chrous - [Tyler Woods] & ad-libs

Living that street life ( living this street life)
That hood life (out on the corner)
Living this gangsta Life (Living this gangsta life)
Gotta sacrafice (Gotta do it)

Living that street life (living this street life)
That hood life (living oh yeah)
Living this gangsta Life (Living this gangsta life)
Gotta sacrafice (ohow)

[Styles P]

I don't need no pen, I don't pad
Yeah I miss my brother yeah I miss my dad
Wanna kill the whole world, sometimes I get so mad
Tell myself to slow down don'T get so fast

Light a bigger Blunt let the shit go pass
But the pain still here so the shit gonna last
Yeah I sit in the dark I'm addicted to weed
Stop buying fast cars 'cause I'm addicted to speed

I don't know what to do, I don't know where to go
I don't fit up in this industry but know I can flow
Why I'm standing in the ghetto when I know I could blow?
Why I'm standing on the corner when I know I should go?

Chrous - [Tyler Woods] & ad-libs

Living that street life ( living this street life)
That hood life (out on the corner)
Living this gangsta Life (Living this gangsta life)
Gotta sacrafice (Gotta do it)

Living that street life (living this street life)
That hood life (living oh yeah)
Living this gangsta Life (Living this gangsta life)
Gotta sacrafice (ohow)

Verse 2

Trying writing a movie, trying writing a book
But even all alone I spend my night with a crook
Try to overstand, try to overlook
Remember how a pig and a rat had a colder look

I'm spiritual, I don't read Jehova's book
Or Allah's book, or God's book
Just a man and it's easy not a hard look
I dont't trust you, so don't trust me

Bullets shiny, blades rusty
Fuck with me, Fuck you that's how it must be
This is D-Block, This is L.O.X
Yeah I'm saying Goodbye but I ain't said hello yet
