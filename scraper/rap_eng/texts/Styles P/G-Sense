[Intro]

You know what it is
Time to go in on these niggas
We lay this shit down pretty nice
Pretty evil we do our thing
Its real big over here on d block you know what I'm saying
We real big on fucking bullshit ass niggas up ( still fired up)
So stay away from me with the dumb shit you know
(Hammers is still loaded and waiting)
Play me

[Verse 1]

The clips hold seventeen (seventeen)
Surprise I ain't die when I was seventeen (surprise)
Little nigga Tryna get heavy cream
Get more then I got (gave)
Give more then I get (give)
I can fall but I won't blame a nigga when I slip (I won't cry)
I'm a grown man life in my own hands
Maybe in the next mans
If he got the ratchet in his best hand
Might have a scope on it
Probably like me if came in the block and the shit had dope on it
Game use your offense always use your defense
Me I use my g-sense just like my presence
Pretints I would never ride to the precinct

[Interlude]

With all these tight jeans can't dig it
Tight jeans and big sneakers make you look like a clown you fuckin asshole!
The streets is mine nigga
Ya bitch ass industry niggas stay in the industry
Stope acting like you a fuckin gangsta when you not
Let's go my nigga

[Verse 2]

A lot of shit bother me
Flash back on robberies
Calmed down
Wolf shit still a big part of me
Think about the Lil one
Hoodied up
Yea down the line
Catch his ass slipping
Pop his ass with a Lil gun
Duece duece with rhinos in it
Followed by the 25
Know I got my thoughts wrong
If I ain't get my money right
Never say what you seen until you seen what you saw
What you saw ain't what you seen nigga say no more
You don't understand the game nigga don't play no more
Retire quick we be on some fire shit
Matches and some gasoline
Fully loaded magazine
Kill em for a bag of green
Puffin on a bag of green
Stab the king
Kidnapped the queen for a bag a green
S.p d-block shit I don't have a thing
My niggas could have a ring
Phone call niggas is on ya'll
