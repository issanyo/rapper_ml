[Hook: Styles P and Trademark]
I'm high, you high, 7 grams in the raw cone
Jet Life high tell the lil' nigga phone home
It's a doobie movie nigga and we all stoned
Yeah the cars and the jewels, they all chrome

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Ugh, Andretti Carleone
Track pants, flip flops, NBA socks 458 Ferrari
(the itsy bitches prolly came out?) Im sorry
Magazines write about the crew that you been knew of
But they just findin out we always was the coolest
This hustle is grueling but us niggas stay moving
Always into
The only way to come out it with the loot is
Make sure your glass bulletproof around them shooters
Gruesome, with that jealousy I make them pussy niggas do ya
Leg room stretchin, star wars Lexus, steamin my veggies
