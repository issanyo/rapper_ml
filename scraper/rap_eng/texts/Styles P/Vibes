[Hook: Styles P]
Vibes, vibes
Money and weed welcome to real niggas lives
Vibes, vibes
Music and weed welcome to real niggas lives

[Verse 1: Styles P]
You can boss up or boss down
From New York To North Cali
You can walk or whip the Porche round
The work just touched
Tell Forty to send the calls round
Told O
I'm ready to free fall now
We don't yell gang gang
We just say Strain Gang
Always high, forever fly
That's how we maintain
And the music is so melodic
Exquisite lifestyle n**** even the dog exotic
No longer selling dope but believe me I thought about it
Before I do I dirt my dog try to talk the Lord about it
Was never was a rat
Never went to the court about it
Thinking about your throat and wrapping a sword around it
I ain't talking bout a burger but order a quarter pounder
Laying on the sand, with all of the water round it
Let's put weight in every state and set up a tour around it

[Hook: Styles P]

[Verse 2: Berner]
Life's a trip, light the piss
Been flagged by every bank I guess I'm a risk
I use to get it by the bale, shout out Mexico
I feel just like 40 I went Federal
And fuck fame, jealousy'll get your life tooken
Lemoncello in my lungs, got my eyes crooked
Sunset Boulevard, we at the sky bar
I'm at the Mondrian, you know what floor I'm on
White girls doing coke off a glass plate
I pull out a stack of blue hundreds outta flat-rate
A bunch of glass tips in my ash tray
We halfway, I'm on a mission till it lands safe
Got it locked on both sides, vibes
Yeah that get high shit for your ride
Tell em get they dough up
This money bundle don't even fold up
