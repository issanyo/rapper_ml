I just want it all right now
I just wanna ball right now
Swear, I want everything, everything
I just want everything, everything
I just want it all right now
I just wanna ball right now
Swear, I want everything, everything
I just want everything, everything

[Verse 1]
Spit it for the streets cause I know that this is what they want
When it come to work for them fiends I got that A-1
When I say that A-1, I ain't talkin’ steak sauce
Bitch I’m talkin’ 9, 10, quarters and them 8 balls
Spit it for the jails- know what a cell feel like
Prolly ain't gon' be a fucking star but bitch I still write
Rest in peace to Moe
I miss 'em we was real tight
Shit, ain't a day ain't around it don't feel right
All I do is get high, fuck bitches, get fly
Blowing money fast while these niggas barely get by
Don't know how they falter
Niggas always broke, man
But everywhere you go them fiends always wanna smoke, man
That's why i got that work
Fucking with them O's
The same amount you payin man, I fuck that up on clothes
And I make it right back
Cause i be in the trap, this money outta town nigga thats a known fact
Where my real hittas at?

Put your chopper to the sky and wave it side to side
She keep it real high 'til the law come
And when they come, just pray
Just cause they make the law, we gon' break it
That's real shit
Real niggas do real things
Loyalty is a lifestyle that niggas don't live, man
Lean told me that when I was upstate
Did a little bid, he was real cause he wrote me back
Real nigga facts, I sold crack to my man mom
When i was on my grind tryna get back
Can't change the past nor I can predict the future
This the gutter that mean it was real like Martin Luther
I had a dream I would make it some day
No job, DCC5, shit I was slanging yay
Know what I do is wrong, that's why everyday I pray
Officer lights [?] and continue with my day
Shit, fuck it I can't help it I'ma hustle up
Movin' weight these niggas still pushing double up
Been doing this since my bitch was playing double dutch
And we the same age since a youngin' I was cuttin' up
Choppin' up raw, hood on smash
58, 12-12 skinnies put it in the back
That was in the past this the present time
Nigga need work you say hold' let me call my line
'What's up ROCK where you at? I need a couple jars"
Like nigga why you cussing on my fucking phone
And got called back on another jack
"Nah word, I got what you need just bring my cash"
Send my youngin' on a mission bring that chicken back
Even my youngins getting chicken we ain't flippin pack
Where they do that at, not around here
And if you ain't from 'round here no need to come around here

[Verse 2: Styles P]
I just want it all, I just wanna ball
Me and all my homies spending millions in the mall
Came a long way from hustling up in the hall
Waiting on a trip for customer to call
Baby want the crib with the mini waterfall
Balmain and Hermes, vacations in the fall
Vacations in the winter at a tropical resort
100 P's in the town that I'm tryna cop 'em all
Then Tryna knock 'em off, then tryna cop some more
You was talking tough shit this what the Glock for
You could tell these hoes you married
My niggas ain't from Houston but we let them rockets off
You ain't doing shit but you said you poppin' off
You really got that bag and drop it off
This is PnB Rock and Ghost from D-Block
I want it all if it's dirty money give me a detox

[Hook]
I just want it all right now
I just wanna ball right now
Swear, I want everything, everything
I just want everything,everything
I just want it all right now
I just wanna ball right now
Swear, I want everything, everything
I just want everything, everything
