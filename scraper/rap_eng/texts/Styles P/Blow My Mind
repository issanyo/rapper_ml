Ghost!
Swoop
S.B
S.B
Ghost

Ehhhh...

(Chorus)
Gonna roll somethin' up so I can just
Blow my mind
I wanna blow my mind
Blow my mind
You should roll somethin' up so you can just, um(?)
Blow your mind
You should just blow your mind
Blow your mind

(Lighters in the air)

Mind blow and we torn down
Still blow an ounce and a half
Even more now
Yeah, put your lighters in the air
Light it up in here
Yeah, put it in the air
See if I'm gonna puff in here

You should find out
I came to blow my mind out
Pass it and you drop it
I'm gonna put you on time-out
Like Joe Frasier I'm smokin'
(??)
In the tub but it feel like the ocean

I swear to God I be floatin'
And I don't need a car to be coastin'
You can say that I'm boastin'
But this is S.B. and I know my time
When I hear "showtime" I'm gonna blow my mind

(Chorus)
The black hippie, the sack with me, the lighter too
I have dreams of Amsterdam every night or two (Amsterdam)
I feel good, the sky couldn't be a brighter blue
Sun lookin' like a tangerine
You got green in this mean(??)
Brother, hit me like a tambourine (hit me)
I need a minute to myself
A second to myself
Pass the duchess on the left
Whoever's second on the L
I'm gonna need candy
'Cause I know my breath is gonna smell
I don't get sleep
But some good restin' off of L
Mind blown, time flies, time's gone (time's gone)
Miss my exit on the highway, ride on (ride on)
Roll another one, yeah my good time's on

(Chorus)
I'm gone
The Yak and the wine gone
Eyes look stoned (??)
But what, I'm grown
Over 21, come over to my zone
In less than two hours, see fifty bucks(??) blown
Lovin' the smell, feelin' the texture
And we got a whole lot
But we still gettin' extra
Guess what's on the menu for breakfast
Roll with The Ghost if you wanna get messed up

(Chorus)
Yeah, just get blown away
You know, do what you do
Bungie jump or something
Speed in a car
Do whatever blows your mind away
I know what blows mine away

You should roll somethin' up so you can just blow your mind
