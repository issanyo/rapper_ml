Gangsta Gangsta with a "A" not a "ER"(x3)
Cuz all I gees I know are part of the revolution

[Verse 1: Stic. Man]

Its not a word to be claiming jus cause it sound cool
The game's so twisted today for lack of ground rules
Is a man of his word a man of action
Never begging, complaining he make it happen
It's not the image they selling us on the TV screen
Is a suvivor, a rider provide by any means
Moving stragey outsmarting his enemies
Ready to give his life, you still wanna be a g?
It's not something you claim just because you from the hood
Everything twisted the game is so misunderstood
Used to be a protector, man of the people
Now they most followers man, where are the leaders?
A ghetto superstar is cool but I know something harder
You dont know gangsta till you know about Bunchy Cater, Aunty Assata, Soondiati Ecoli
Not to disrespect their legacy but thats the real OG's
The one who has the biggest mouth to be the biggest coward
No time for petty beef a gee is about getting power
Thats why you can only be down after initiation
So niggas know how you respond in different situations

Cuz All I Gees I know are part of the revolution

[Verse 2: Styles P]

He was a mean one nah he was born one
He dont ever say a thing when the law comes
He dont need a posse of brothers that act wild
He works a Hard Job and tries to raise a black child
He breaks bread with his people like Jesus did
He tried to explain to the children what the evils is
Knows the spots where the crack, coke and diesel is
Did some time in the pen now he diesel kid
He know the penile system is part slavery
Knows that the judge on the stand is where the pagan be
Knows freedom is priceless it takes bravery
He knows I ain't an animal but they caging me
He plays DP thinking about his DP's
Wish he had a hundred guns headed up to DC
He wants change like Obama did
Probably lived where your mama lives

[Verse 3: M1]
Is is the bandana, the hat, the loafs or the gatt
I tell you off the bat hell nah it ain't none of that
It ain't the smell of the chronic the broken ebonics
They be the main ones poppin that shit but they dont want it
Willing to live or to die for what he believe in
He know the code of the streets you can't decieve him
A gangsta's word is his bond you must respect that
He keep his flag and his rep well protected
Is it the bankroll? The bulletproff tank? no
Look at his tattoos the women about to faint so
He could of went to jail but been the biggest snitch Or
He could when you trust your loyality you switch
