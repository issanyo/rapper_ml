[All Verses: Styles P]

Zoned like the Twilight
8 mill a bid, niggas that live the high life
All of my niggas fly right
Whutchu know about staring out the skylight?

Why you lookin' at the skyline
Mad high, you probly readin' the high times
The room dark but my 9 shine
The room dark but my mind shine
Something like the cat, yea you better kill me 9 times
I smoke loud but I’m on the hush
Weed ain’t coke but I get a rush
Never gon' give it up, only gon' live it up

You ain’t got to touch me, you can feel the pain
You could close your eyes, still see the pain
Every couple of minutes I’m lightin' up the weed again
Breathing in, breathing out
Goin through some bullshit, weeded out
Sittin’ on the couch mad high with my Nina out
Right path, wrong shoes
A pawn could kill a king but the king could kill a pawn too
Pray to God that you do what you’re born to
NBA shit, no 3, take the long 2
Try to figure what you belong to
A lot of niggas rhyme, me, I smoke and make song food
I’m in the zone that you never saw
Family over everything, or what you getting cedar for?
Fuck boy, grimy shit is what you get, deaded for
Talking to the pigs is what you get beheaded for

Up in the spot, niggas is high like that
Out on the strip, nigga are ridin like that
Anybody could die, it’s live like that
Hustle for stacks, nigga survive like that

Up in the spot, niggas is high like that
Out on the strip, nigga are ridin like that
Anybody could die, it’s live like that
Hustle for stacks, nigga survive like that

Smoke to til I'm dozin', weed keep me warm cuz I'm frozen
What if the chosen one wasn’t chosen?
If everything was golden like silence
You wouldn’t talk shit, and we wouldn’t have violence
Salute to the stylish, styles that I’m stylin’
Always on the move like the meter that clock mileage
High like the pilot, deadly like a virus
Talkin G shit, I’mma look you in the iris
Smoking on that loud pack, everything is quiet though
Starin at the skyline, shit is lookin' brighter though
Caught up in my web but you ain’t see the spider though
I ain’t got a silencer, pillow or a Idaho
What nigga?

Up in the spot, niggas is high like that
Out on the strip, nigga are ridin like that
Anybody could die, it’s live like that
Hustle for stacks, nigga survive like that

Up in the spot, niggas is high like that
Out on the strip, nigga are ridin like that
Anybody could die, it’s live like that
Hustle for stacks, nigga survive like that

Zoned like the Twilight
8 mill a bid, niggas that live the highlife
All of my niggas fly right
Whutchu know about staring out the skylight?
