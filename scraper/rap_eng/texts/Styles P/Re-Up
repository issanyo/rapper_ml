Roll up Thumbs!

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Now we ain't down no more, we up nigga
Quickest way to the top is to re up nigga
Got your man in the zone tell him D up nigga
I still see you in my rear view speed up nigga
I was just pursuing it everybody was doing it
It was like a tradition and who was I to ruin it
Nothing else matter as long as the work landed
You got your regular smokers and then it’s the  thirst bandits
Granted I’m in the sport for the cake
Straight money get the rock
Short money get the shake
No credit tell your story to the Jake
I just bought a new crib 100 thou for the drapes
I ain’t have a choice


[Chorus: L-Biz]
Couldn’t get a job so I re-uped
Momma need food so I re-uped
Got locked hit the library gotta read up
Ain't no way we letting the justice system beat us
So when there is no means gotta re-up
And when the kids don’t eat gotta re-up
Losing all kinds of sleep till I re up
If I don’t do it who the hell is gonna feed us
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up


[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
D-B’s up nigga
The product got low had to re up nigga
You ain’t gon make it sitting down and crying about it G’ up nigga
You ain’t gotta get a black mask ski up nigga
I went from putting work on the stove to verses with HOV
Rental cars to get personally drove
Poconos to Nassau Bahamas rooms
Suites at the cove
My OG had me bagging up work it was real
But my talent outweighed what he had on the scale
Big ASCAP checks in the mail
First I wasn’t shit now these dirty bitches trying to throw me they tail
My vegan brother tried to make me eat kale
My older nigga said make it, save it, so you won’t see jail
Save my dough, single parent mom knew I would blow
You a diamond dust it off soon it would show
My money is like my kids I love watching them grow

[Chorus: L-Biz]
Couldn’t get a job so I re-uped
Momma need food so I re-uped
Got locked hit the library gotta read up
Ain't no way we letting the justice system beat us
So when there is no means gotta re-up
And when the kids don’t eat gotta re-up
Losing all kinds of sleep till I re up
If I don’t do it who the hell is gonna feed us
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Master of the hustle lord of the 12' 12'
I sold base and I swore I was flyer than LL
Pyrex baking soda familiar with hell smell
Do my dirt pon my lonely cause what could a shell tell
No longer on that hard tip
Cause I’m on the beaches, weed and car kits
I am a narcissist that’s heartless
I’m lying but I swing iron fill up a cartridge
Going to war a few men will die
Re-uped conquered the law committed genocide
All I now is another ten minutes another ten will fly
Now I’m an entrepnouer the things enterprised
I ain’t going to jail I ain’t posting the bail
I’m the brother Donnie told you bout pushing the kale
Probably on a island hot spotting the wheel
Now the re-up is all legal beloved how can I feel
Ghost

[Chorus: L-Biz]
Couldn’t get a job so I re-uped
Momma need food so I re-uped
Got locked hit the library gotta read up
Ain't no way we letting the justice system beat us
So when there is no means gotta re-up
And when the kids don’t eat gotta re-up
Losing all kinds of sleep till I re up
If I don’t do it who the hell is gonna feed us
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up
Whoa, whoa, whoa time to re-up
