[Intro:]
Fuck that, cause I'm from New York city, goddamn it!
[?]
You fuck around with me there gon' be consequences and repercussions
(I got em son)

[Verse 1:]
What more can I say with New Yorks and WAs?
We go hard like Mac Dre reppin' the Bay
The price of fame is heavy but I know how it weigh
Latex gloves and silencers, I know how to spray
But I ain't here to lecture you
I done shot niggas and sold crack
That's why the wash is oyster perpetual
Tryna get higher than my last flight
Tryna remember the bitch name from last night
Them duke boys say they fuck wid us
Someone you land in NY get in touch with us
Beyonce face on a hood rat
This D-Block, nigga, we all know that

[Hook:]
How should I plead? On the brink of insanity
Trials of a hungry nigga
Coke dreams is gettin' bigger
We live life by only triggers
All we know is wake up, smoke trap
All we know is bitches, hit the block strapped
All we know is sour, haze, yak
All we know is D-Block
All we know is LOX
All we know is...

[Verse 2:]
Sittin' on money, I own the coke plug
Fuckin' read up with the dope plug
Got the weed on the way, but came to smoke plug
Shawty and two handguns, bigger than both snubs
(Two guns up) give you the power to see ghosts
Just walked down and seen a ghost
Who lookin' to get pocked or popped in the throat?
Nah, I don't wanna lecture ya nigga, I turn you vegetable
Gun hit niggas till bitches is bisexual
Lex know to park by itself, it's intellectual
Hang from the doorway and shoot em, the professional
Real smooth nigga, but show em what the aggression do

[Hook:]
How should I plead? On the brink of insanity
Trials of a hungry nigga
Coke dreams is gettin' bigger
We live life by only triggers
All we know is wake up, smoke trap
All we know is bitches, hit the block strapped
All we know is sour, haze, yak
All we know is D-Block
All we know is LOX
All we know is...

[Verse 3 - Jadakiss:]
Niggas livin life on the treadmill
You ain't never touch it so you don't know how that bread feel (nah)
Love is gone the hate is strong
Only a casket or a cell can break the bond
I got prescription pills I got the straight heron
I test it out in the hood I get a great response
I got a gun in my trunk, anotha one in my palm
Nigga, I'm Al Qaeda Jeda, son of Sadam
On some terrorist shit, oh, you scared of my now?
Have yo family emblocked, I put yo man in the ground
Till we finish the game and get to settle the score
Cause my money is up and I'm ready for war

[Hook:]
How should I plead? On the brink of insanity
Trials of a hungry nigga
Coke dreams is gettin' bigger
We live life by only triggers
All we know is wake up, smoke trap
All we know is bitches, hit the block strapped
All we know is sour, haze, yak
All we know is D-Block
All we know is LOX
All we know is...
