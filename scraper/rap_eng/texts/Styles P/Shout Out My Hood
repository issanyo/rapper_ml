[Intro: Styles P]
Yeah
East, Ghost
G-Shit, worldwide
We're family

[Chorus: Dave East]
Shout out my Crips that still Crippin', nigga
Shout out my Bloods that still Bloodin', nigga
Straight out the dirt, shout out my muddy niggas
Came from the bottom, all my get money niggas

[Verse 1: Styles P & Dave East]
When I die, you ain't got to cry, you just got to pray
Put some weed where I lay, I'ma see another day
Full of energy, you my enemy, you got to pay
Was on the East side, fuckin' with them Crips the other day
Was on the West side, fuckin' with them Bloods the other day
Always look you in your eye, never look the other way
Where I'm from, they can't get you, then they make your brother pay
Doin' dirt, leave you hurt, then they make your mother pray
We got raw plus cook up in this bitch
Master P with the grams, I got the hook-up in this bitch
Shots almost hit the passenger, they shook up in the whip
Before the deal, Iâ€™ll take a trip to Brooklyn for the stick
Tried to go the college route, but that's on Tookie, I was Crip
Weed, The Color Purple, think of Whoopi when it's lit
Tried to start an empire, broke down a cookie in the crib
Toss you off a high bridge then play A Boogie wit'cho bitch

[Chorus: Dave East]
Shout out my Crips that still Crippin', nigga
Shout out my Bloods that still Bloodin', nigga
Straight out the dirt, shout out my muddy niggas
Came from the bottom, all my get money niggas

[Verse 2: Dave East & Styles P]
That's on Maleek, you ain't seen nothin' like this
I'm Leonidas, three hundred hitters with me, shit excitin'
You can't imagine walkin' to the store, duckin' indictments
Tatted my face, approachin' my enemies like I'm Tyson
Breitlings, ratties in the car with no license
You know that the block bitin'
I'ma throw the knife to his pipe, I do not like 'em
We gon' cop it all from the Gucci to Nike items
We love some bright items
I fell back from the Roc like J-A-Y hyphen
Z650 Kawasaki on indictment
Dope in Howard University, the stamp was a bison
These diamonds are enticin', still ridin' with no license
If you ain't need a Lycan, you should pray to Christ
Me and East got the streets and we got the beast frightened
You ain't got no gas, you should have the shit siphoned
Just leave the lab, crumble all that bullshit you writin'
Yeah

[Chorus: Dave East]
Shout out my Crips that still Crippin', nigga
Shout out my Bloods that still Bloodin', nigga
Straight out the dirt, shout out my muddy niggas
Came from the bottom, all my get money niggas

[Verse 3: Dave East & Styles P]
I got love for my Bloods and all my neutral niggas
I got love for my Crips and 'go stupid' niggas
Whole brick in the trunk, duckin' the state trooper, nigga
In a hotel askin' the plug what could he do for niggas
I don't care if it's crowded, I pick you out a group of niggas
Take you on a ride of your life, but not Uber, nigga
Puttin' prices on they head, they think I used to hoop with niggas
Want Disney money but we ain't fuckin' with Goofy niggas

[Chorus: Dave East]
Shout out my Crips that still Crippin', nigga
Shout out my Bloods that still Bloodin', nigga
Straight out the dirt, shout out my muddy niggas
Came from the bottom, all my get money niggas
