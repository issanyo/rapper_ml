VERSE 1

Told you I miss you

U said you think it's best if I don’t

But I can't let go

I don't love you  tho

Your more like a drug

I’m addicted to u

Yeah 24/7 I be wanting u


PRE-CHORUS

My heart and my brain

Are fighting over what to do with this pain

And even though u won't  admit it

I know u don't feel the same


CHORUS

But I'm here Drooling over you again

Drooling over you again

Drooling over you again

Yeah Drooling over you again

Drooling over you again

Drooling over you again


VERSE 2

I think u know exactly how I feel

And that's why u take advantage of me

I gave u time

I gave u space everything u need

But It seems like I'm not what u need

PRE-CHORUS

But My heart and my brain

Are fighting over what to do with this pain

And even though u won't  admit It

I know u don't feel the same

CHORUS

But I’m here Drooling over you again

Drooling over you again

Drooling over you again

Yeah  Drooling over you again

Drooling over you again

Drooling over you again

BRIDGE

I love that I’m patient

Cause One day you're gonna regret it

I’m not wishing or hoping for the worst

But I know I was the best

And u throw my emotions right into to the dirt

Everything I said you throw it to curb

So I

I don't understand why I'm drooling over u again

Don't understand why I  still rely to the messages

Don’t understand

Why I'm here drooling over you again


ONTRO

Drooling over you

Drooling

Drooling over you again

Yeah
