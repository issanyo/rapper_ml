Oh! Most of us came from a broken home
Drowning all my sorrows
Drinking liquor trying to smoke alone
Arguing with my wife so I broke the phone
... but the plane is on!
... is acting funny with the work
Like my money didn't work
He gonna end up getting murdered
The... acting funny with the...
Like the shit that I spit on the record wasn't real!
Hood man, but they know...
But they end up in jealousy to end a nigga high!
The other day I say... fuck
When I play the bodega it was... dance for the Dutch
Keep it real, we're living in real time
And I'm feeling the niggers' pain
But they never can feel mine!
So I'm a go with the green light
I don't even sleep, how the fuck could I dream right?

[Chorus:]
Yeah, yeah!
And you keep telling me things are getting better
Yeah, yeah!
But I'm a do me, you can say whatever I'm a G!

... guess it's a sad think my... is magic!
I remember I never I never said December was cold
But February was drastic
... my niggers and what they...
... when the murder scene is tragic!
Niggers can talk shit, we don't even glimpse
Niggers can get hit, we don't even wince!
... entourage and I don't mean Vince
Purple label and purple Porsche...
I look into the sky life, my life
And I zip my lips the minute they read my rights
Blowin' on a lone Dutch in here
How I lie, rather die to be in jail
It's so good 'till it's all bad
And the ugly niggers gonna crash your broad's...

[Chorus:]
Yeah, yeah!
And you keep telling me things are getting better
Yeah, yeah!
But I'm a do me, you can say whatever I'm a G!

I keep on moving on my new... on the blocks
... the young boys move...
... I salute cause it's the... west like...
What they do for...
In the nights... your brain is out when the cocaine...
Again I know my men got life out the game
Don't stop so pull the weed out tonight's...
Yeah, it's like that...
My down South niggers they got...
My East Coast niggers they got the...
... you found what your friends did
I throw this money over bitches
But niggers... so let's kick it!
If you really live by the G code shoot a couple of guns
Hurry up and reload!

[Chorus:]
Yeah, yeah!
And you keep telling me things are getting better
Yeah, yeah!
But I'm a do me, you can say whatever I'm a G!
