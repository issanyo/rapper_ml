Hey yo, before this rap shit I was making them packs flip
When it was money in this crack shit, them fiends double back quick
Born with the heart, cop the hammer let it clap quick
Brow still smoking, tug the scrap under my mattress
Fucking with a nigga with issues, next step
Is a funeral and a familly that miss you, cold sweats
Stay the fuck from around me, less you want your face whipped
Fuck stitches and staples this nigga need a facelift
See I ain't got patience, niggas like to talk a lot
Put the pressure on, the same niggas try to call the cops
I'm the one that call the shots, your whole fuckin squad know
Die slow, caught my first charge around 94
Me and Dashy lil niggas scrappin with the police
I was 13, an open case with two co-d's
Fuck can you show me, I done seen it all nigga
Nigga grew up fast, I walked first I never crawled nigga
And I never call niggas, if I'm in a tight spot
Tryna leave a nigga at the morgue in the ice box
So please be cautious, when you fuck with AP
God was on his bullshit when he made me

I'm from YO where everybody bold
You can catch a case like a cold
Town seem hotter than a stove
Young niggas ain't getting old
Even the killers should've get filled up with holes
Everybody cryin the broke life
Blowin weed, shootin dice talkin the coke price
Niggas tryna come up real hard
Stick up kids'll run up real hard
Seen the future playin cards in the yard
Back in 93 I know then I'd be large and 'core
Making thoughts to make new york say I'm hard
Everybody knew I was thorough
Hit the block with a pack see my nigga like Eyo
Yo Half, light a blunt and get a bottle my nigga
Life hard and we might miss tomorrow my nigga
All we had was us, fiends had the rush
Got money, got pussy we ain't had to lust
And I come from a real click
Where niggas do real shit
Couple niggas hustle, couple niggas to peel shit
Yeah I said a lil face will get you a big face
Same way a lil case will get you a big case
I'ma wolf, I ain't got a rat or pig trait
Snake trait, cross me no place in the world will be a safe place
Find you, whatever it takes
To get your face ate
SP the ghost, nigga wild like a great ape
