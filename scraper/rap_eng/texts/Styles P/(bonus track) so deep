Exhale and ventilate
If you can't build and destroy then you renovate
Thoughts that innovate, blinding on the interstate
Back with the Devil when me and Death had a dinner date
Yeah, Im a cynic but I dont know how the venom taste
Snake ain't I me, wolf is
Chip on my shoulder, another one where the tooth is
If Im in the building then Im probably where the roof is
Wonder it the angels music is acoustic
Cause mine is electric
The depth of my soul can't be measure by the metric
Raised where its hectic, black magic
And the flow is majestic
Magician on the tarot card
Ask myself can I disappear from Babylon
Been this and that, I could breathe in a storm
Make the mannequins rap, what up
Its like I make niggas shiver and think
Im so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
Its like I make niggas shiver and think
Im so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
All my niggas going to war
Imma go first, ask the guy where should I look
Im on a soul search, can't cross the bridge unless I pay the toll first
Can't make the point unless I squatter gold first
Pull that sour kush, I dont roll dirt
Niggas will clap but you gotta give em a show first
Niggas is acting, improve your improv
The ride ain't pretty cause the life ain't no rickshaw
You gonna break down, the down breaks
Standing on shaky ground, know you make it, the ground shake
Niggas will merk you for a pound cake
And then cry about it, down sake
Till I blow ain't a nigga in the town safe
Outside pitching until the motherfucking mountain break
Dont you ever cop no ground weight
Lean on the white work, nigga, thats life work
Its like I make niggas shiver and think
Im so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
Its like I make niggas shiver and think
Im so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
In here for the insight, flow Gs, probably an OZ in my windpipes
Cloud of smoke on my frontal lobe
Told my niggas my vision is still tunnel, though
I could see the light at the end
I wonder why you know its a mic at the end
In the audience still, I dream an end, tryna make about 40 a year
Its like I make niggas shiver and think
Im so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
Its like I make niggas shiver and think
Im so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
