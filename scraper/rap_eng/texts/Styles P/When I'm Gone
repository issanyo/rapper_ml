[Rap - Styles P]
If you leaving go ahead leave
I still pop champagne
I still blow them trees
And I won't even ask you to stay
I'll accumulate a whole lotta cash in a day
You gone miss me when I'm not around
And that big body jaguar chocolate brown
With the Neiman Marcus seats poppin' now
Got my hands on my collar I pop em now

[Verse 1 - Emanny]
You don't have to play it
Play those silly games
You play with me
And no need to say it
Say anything you don't believe
If you wanna go
Girl I won't make you stay
You can tell me you love me want me
Ya need me but I know it's changed
But wait and you see

[Chorus - Emanny]
You gone miss me when I'm gone
You gone miss me when I'm not around, you'll see
You gone hate it when I'm done
You gone hate it when you can't come back to me

[Verse 2 - Emanny]
Girl why would you stay
If you wanna leave
I can look in your eyes
It's easy to see
Your done with me
So baby just go
Cause I won't make you stay
You can tell me you love me want me
You need me but I can feel it's changing
But just wait and see

[Chorus - Emanny]
You gone miss me when I'm gone
You gone miss me when I'm not around, you'll see
You gone hate it when I'm done
You gone hate it when you can't come back to me
You gone miss me when I'm gone

[Rap  - Jadakiss]
You ain't listening you just hear my voice
You ain't here by force you here by choice
If you could leave if you wanna leave go ahead yo
I'd rather not work it out
Please instead go
Now when I look in ya eyes I feel strange
You can say whatever you want you still changed
Even tho the sun comes out it still rains
It's nothing like trying to cover up real pain
Somebody that you thought was your lover, was real lame
But she ain't doing nothing but playing them real games
Now shes alone listening to the song
And the sad part about it
She gone miss me cause I'm gone

[Chorus - Emanny]
You gone miss me when I'm gone
You gone miss me when I'm not around, you'll see
You gone hate it when I'm done
You gone hate it when you can't come back to me
You gone miss me when I'm gone

[Outro - Emanny]
You gone miss me when I'm done
Said you gone miss me when I'm gone
Hey Hey
You gone miss me when I'm done
