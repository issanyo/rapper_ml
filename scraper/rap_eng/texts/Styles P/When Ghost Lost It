[Verse]
I'm just trying to swallow the pain
But it seems like the weed and the (?) bottles my thing
I shiver cause my daughter gone
Wonder when I die, will I take smoke or water form?
Talking to God everyday
Yeah I'm thankful, but shit is feeling hard everyday
Some are more fortunate, some are less
I'm just trying to pass the test if paradise comes next
I dance with the devil on the dark side
The light from the bars is from the angels in the archives
I ain't got religion so everything I'm spitting on
Everything I'm given's from a zone on the far side
Living when I sleep cause I'm dying when I'm up
I ain't lying look at the clock, the time is never stuck
But I don't watch the clock, when I'm sleep, what the fuck
Need to slow down, but the fast life's such a rush
Crying blood and I'm pissing 'gnac
Money come and go, but love ones you don't get 'em back
Just see 'em on the other side
Unless ya looking with ya other eye
Heartbreak when my wife or mother cry
The heart break but the soul can't
Guess this shit is part of the programme
But I am the wizard, David Lo Pan
Big trouble up in little Yonkers
I am a beast, yeah the kid's a monster
My whole life's been a rough ride
Tryin to see 180, on the plus side
So a nigga need prayer hands
Not on the text, or the tweet or the 'gram, fam
But I'm talking real life, dog
I'm yours, yeah the shit is real life, dog
