Everyday I wake up, I swear to god I wanna lay a ni##a
Can't trust a soul your close friend will betray a ni##a
Get you 25 years or fu#k around and spray a ni##a
Tell em what you sayin ni##a
Don't play the game if you can't be a player ni##a
Just can't provoke all this coke that they weighin ni##a
Listen what I'm sayin ni##a
If your caught don't talk in the courts
Just go and hit the bar like the hulk, green man
They gotta take one for the team and this
Situation sticky like semen, without a bi#ch to lick it off
You need a lawyer that could pick it off
Find the witnesses, fu#k it I'ma hit em off
I'm a M.O.B.S.T.E.R
Four door car or somethin that revolve
We can talk business, or we can talk the businesss
And takin out ya bodies cause real ni##as live this
And boy you just makin up bars
I spit where I live, how I live and why I'm so hard
We all got rap sheets
But I'm the one to make ni##as run
Like the guy with the gun at the track?
Call me G host
Used to sell P dope
Watch out for pachengo if you wanna be carlito
I got big knives, I got big guns
Old school sh#t, want some come get some
