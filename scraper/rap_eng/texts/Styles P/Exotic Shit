[Intro: Styles P]
My socks cost a lot, my nigga
It's exotic shit, you know?
My tank top is wonderful
You ain't never see reefer like this, nigga
I mean just look at me, I'm fuckin' beautiful

[Chorus: Styles P & Dave East]
Ghetto nigga, ghetto nigga
Exotic whips, exotic whips
Exotic clothes, exotic clothes
Exotic smoke, exotic smoke
Exotic women and exotic flows, exotic flows
Exotic does as exotic knows
Ghetto nigga, ghetto nigga
Exotic whips, exotic whips
Exotic clothes, exotic clothes
Exotic smoke, exotic smoke
Exotic women and exotic flows, exotic
Exotic does as exotic knows, exotic

[Verse 1: Styles P]
All my niggas is mad live
Louis luggage is rugged, nigga, I'm mad fly
Used to be a dope boy, right in back of the cab ride
Right around the time when Duke beat the Fab Five
All through high school, nigga, I went to class high
Baptized in fire, a wicked nigga with mad rhymes
Plus where I live in the hood, they sling mad dimes
Hit the park, shoot up the game during half time
Beamers with the kits, ninas gon' kick if I hit'cha hood
You gon' need FEMA in that bitch
What's one lion with ten hyenas in the mix
You ain't got to see the script, it's a bigger movie than DreamWorks
Niggas stayin' woke but still makin' they dream work
Before rap, I had crack, makin' my C.R.E.A.M. work
Burgundy Denali by the alley, weed from Cali
Linen suit, pair of Balleys, big crib by the valley
Ghost

[Chorus: Styles P & Dave East]
Ghetto nigga, ghetto nigga
Exotic whips, exotic whips
Exotic clothes, exotic clothes
Exotic smoke, exotic smoke
Exotic women and exotic flows, exotic flows
Exotic does as exotic knows
Ghetto nigga, ghetto nigga
Exotic whips, exotic whips
Exotic clothes, exotic clothes
Exotic smoke, exotic smoke
Exotic women and exotic flows, exotic
Exotic does as exotic knows, exotic

[Verse 2: Dave East]
My bitch exotic, we don't speak the same language
Got a bunch of new hammers but I keep the same stainless
Bloomingdales and Barneys before I became famous
Know the streets well, gimmie a canvas and I can paint it
Authentic nigga, I don't get caught and try to explain it
I just put the pain on the records, let the hood go debate it
Tell momma I made it
First class, she take exotic flights
Exotic dinners, I'm half Spanish, we ate a lotta rice
Exotic talks with the plug, prayin' he drop the price
Gucci so exotic, Bal Harbour, I had to cop it twice
Exotic smoke is still stuck on my fingertips, finger lickin'
We do Miamis or we just bring a stick
Jet skiing water, remindin' me of my Patek
Harlem hot, I had to come to Yonkers for the package
Exotic cougar wit' me, she like to listen to Gladys
Designed exotic in the ghetto, I keep her balanced
East

[Chorus: Styles P & Dave East]
Ghetto nigga, ghetto nigga
Exotic whips, exotic whips
Exotic clothes, exotic clothes
Exotic smoke, exotic smoke
Exotic women and exotic flows, exotic flows
Exotic does as exotic knows
Ghetto nigga, ghetto nigga
Exotic whips, exotic whips
Exotic clothes, exotic clothes
Exotic smoke, exotic smoke
Exotic women and exotic flows, exotic
Exotic does as exotic knows, exotic
