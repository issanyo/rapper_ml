[Verse 1: Styles P]
Shit, I play the game like I s'posed to
You pay for my vocals
Light up a smoke to
The hood where I come from, you watch who you spoke to
Cause everybody wanna blow, or damn sure hope to
Cash, cars, liquor, weed, plenty of soul food
The game got no rules
Watch who you showin' the code to
Flying now? Watch who you showing the blow to
You might be slippin' now, but you'll remember I told you
When he say the world is his like Tony did, or Nino did
Or get real sticky like Nicky did in Casino, kid
Yeah, you got to pop 'em like a little kid
Do the time standin' on your head, like a little bid
Shit, is it cool to be rowdy then?
Long money, no state time, just a county pen
Nigga, it can't get no dumber
Fuck around and get hit with some football numbers
Giants versus the Broncos, but we got the game called
Runnin' from the narcos
Soul look black, but my eyes got the sparkle
Hunger add fuel to the fire like charcoal
Why you think I'm hard, though?
Yeah, like a yardie I leave hard, though
White-yellow Porsche with the dark blue [?]
You know I'm comin' from sorrow
Singin' with the angels, I ain't fuckin' with diablo
