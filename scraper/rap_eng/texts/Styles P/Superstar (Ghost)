[Intro]
Ghost, let me know who to haunt today
Ain't Houston, but got rockets I could launch away
Ain't a red bottom-nigga, but a red button-nigga
Shotgun loaded up, headhuntin', nigga
My gun is a dickhead, let it come in, nigga
Now I go 'head and pause that
Bullets is comin', you can never pause that
Eh, that goon money is cool, that rap money is good
That business money is great
But you watch what you sayin' when you sittin' in the hood
Little spot off the Gulf Coast, duplex on the outskirts
I know your bitch on the rag
But I don't really sweat it cause I know that her mouth works
Tell your clique suck dick when I outburst
Smokin', reminiscin' on movin' that down-south work
Have you ever seen a nigga bleed?
You was just rappin', lyin', smokin' your weed
I was in the trenches with niggas that got to eat
Been to funerals with mothers that got to weep
Had to stay awake with niggas that need to sleep
I would lose a arm for some niggas that's knee-deep
If you feelin' (-), fuck it, you got to leave
Ghost stay cool, but you know that I got the heat
Lower the handguns, say a long prayer
Sat at the mirror, gave a long stare
Feel it comin' and the night is the wrong air, outside anyway
Weigh a buck-eighty and whatever the semi weigh
A dollar bill weigh much less than a penny weigh
So you was talkin' heavy, I fucked with the featherweights
Goin' through hell, but I'll send you through heaven's gates
H-O-L-I-D-A-Y, happy
Spray the lobby where your cousin and your auntie stay
