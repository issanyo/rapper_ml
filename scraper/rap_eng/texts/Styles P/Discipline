[Verse 1]

Discipline
Keep a hard headed nigga listening
Louch told me fall back
Play my positioning
Niggas violate
They gon' find 'em where they fishing in
Eyes and ears missin' em
No time for dissin' em
Blow the medication with niggas with dedication
Name a day and an hour I'll set off the detonation
I speak what I feel
And I keep this shit real
So it's hard for the kid to get radio penetration
A leaf 'bout to turn
Only in America will a boiler earn millions
When Sheek get his turn
I don't plan on shittin'
But I plan on whippin'
Suttin' that look different
On the lean when it's sittin'
Switch cars like clothes and I ain't bullshittin'
Benz in the morning, Beamer in the afternoon
Lambo at night, I'm high if i'm in back of you
S.P. the Ghost in the grind like a slow dance
Might sell a lot but vs me, you got no chance
Parties on the street you don't believe me ask yo' man
All them niggas play me in them lil' black radios
White tee, long shorts, throw away P80 yo
Shit is still gravy though
Never try to play me though
My man's on the roof
And I'll tell him to let your lady go
You should understand, I don't change much
Except when I go to killa nigga now and go change up
