[Verse 1: Styles P]
See the paint, smell the strain
It's mob lookin', meetin' in the smellin' range
A couple million bucks can make a fella change
Stellar with the acappella, Ip Man, boxin' games
My impact, if you took the pack but ain't got the change
These niggas said they G but we not the same
'Cause a flea can kill a dog when the chopper ring
Usually your dope boy, jack boy shot the thing
I've been on my P shit, leaflet, paper lit
Fax here, wax here, dab it you can vapor it
I can give you game, nigga do the same
Red and blue the same, if the whites is the only niggas makin' it

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm floatin' through the smoke
My eyes are barely open
I'm 'bout to roll another one up
I'm floatin' through the smoke
My eyes are barely open
I'm 'bout to roll another one up
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)

[Verse 2: Berner]
You're my overdose
If you smoke with Ghost you might tap out
If you burn with Bern I'm on OC dope
Snow white, Limoncello and Cherry Sherb
This new shit look hella crazy
I'm smoked out on a private plane
I got two b's in my Louie bag
I'm a real weed-head, we don't move the same
I got extracts, head stash
I'm still in the Bay, border pass that
I'm on the 101 goin' hella fast
Send them bitches, sellin' packs
Live a good life, been to hell and back
More first class flights, blow plenty of cash
My hair spendin' and my team winnin'
I woke up drunk next to three women
I'm poppin' tags and rubber bands
I just got a new spa for my mother plants
I bought a fifty pack on my rapper vans
I don't sleep at all till the package lands
Glass jars full of new strains
We change the game and they love it (they do)
New York, October, them indoors keep comin'
Yeah it's flooded

[Hood: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm floatin' through the smoke
My eyes are barely open
I'm 'bout to roll another one up
I'm floatin' through the smoke
My eyes are barely open
I'm 'bout to roll another one up
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)

[Verse 3: Styles P & Berner]
Plant based but I'mma cash cow
Entrepeneur to put the meds down
Pick it back up, put the cash up
Real nigga, lay it back down
Driftin' on 'em sideways
Ain't high enough to see God's face
But that snowman, in that King jack
And that guava, I'm in God's space
We be up in them airlines
We be rippin' them highways
If you can't grow it through Dubai way
For that big body in that driveway
Crime pays, I'm on the highway
Big Rig Truck, wanna fly away
Well in the game, you a lightweight
Your girl love the way a lemon pie taste
Big ass crib and I pops the rubbers
I'm on FaceTime just talkin' numbers
52, 32, 22, even 15
Dude we eat so good we don't sip no lean
We don't cut no coke, no we leave this shit clean
I was only sixteen when I made twenty grand
Put it right back to work, in this city I'm the man

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm floatin' through the smoke
My eyes are barely open
I'm 'bout to roll another one up
I'm floatin' through the smoke
My eyes are barely open
I'm 'bout to roll another one up
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
I'mma keep smokin' (Don't stop)
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop, I'mma keep smokin'
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop, I'mma keep smokin'
I'mma keep smokin'
Don't stop
Don't stop
