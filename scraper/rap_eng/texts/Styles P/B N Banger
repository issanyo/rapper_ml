[Hook: Masspike Miles]
I put the B in Banger
Used to getting money
Nigga no I'm no stranger to the hustle
Strapped up like the raider from the tomb
Boss of my platoon
I do shit you boys never do
I'm known in the streets as a nigga that done did it
Don't move an inch or the beam's on your fitted
Trust me you can get it, ye nigga you can get it
Pull the hammer back and watch the motherfucker bang, bang, bang
​
[Verse 1: Chubby Jag]
My gun ill, I'm the sick man
I'm turnt up I'm on one like a kick stand
The rich man couple diamonds in the wrist band
Catch you on the stool holme, shootin' til the clip jam
The shotty blow out the nigga body like a stick man
The pound blow make them drown slow, quick sand
I ride rough like drag on niggas ye I smash on niggas
Pour gas on niggas, then I blast on niggas
You don't got it then I'm taking his
Used to hustle with the Knicks holme, Jason Kidd
Fifteen for sixteen that's sixteen
Double that I'm grown now, I told you I get cream
You dig me, dirty nigga but my kicks clean
Hustle hard I'm nice with the price but my strip mean
Blastin' hoes, classic foes
Niggas clap until the casket close
Round here, we let it bang
​

I put the B in Banger
Used to getting money
Nigga no I'm no stranger to the hustle
Strapped up like the raider from the tomb
Boss of my platoon
I do shit you boys never do
I'm known in the streets as a nigga that done did it
Don't move an inch or the beam's on your fitted
Trust me you can get it, ye nigga you can get it
Pull the hammer back and watch the motherfucker bang, bang, bang
​
[Verse 2: Styles P]
I'm back out riding
Gun to your head but at the center like Bynum
Shotgun with the shotgun seat reclining
I pop up on niggas let it off
Close shop up on niggas, affection
Stay in the cut on niggas, I'm in a whole 'nother section
I could look in the mirror in my reflection moves like inception
Extraordinary gentleman what more can I say
Got the picture in the cut like Dorian Gray
I'm a shooter like Allan Quatermain
I give you morning pain, first page in the hard nigga hall of fame
Dwayne the Rock on the beat
Ask me how it goes, I make it pop on the streets
Probably in the spot for a week
One eye open with the Glock when I sleep
​

Strapped up like the raider from the tomb

Don't move an inch or the beam's on your fitted
Trust me you can get it, ye nigga you can get it
Pull the hammer back and watch the motherfucker bang, bang, bang
​
[Verse 3: Chubby Jag]
I let the thang blam, they call me the Rain Man
I'm out of bullets get 'em hung nigga hangman
You get me hang it up, it's problems I flame it up
Bang it up, snap back, long T banger tuck
Chubby, my block pitching ye I got pigeons
I'm into cooking I fuck with bitches that got kitchens
If I can't find Jordan then I'll ride Pippen
I leave 'em bloody and skin red like Rob Griffin, home real stick
The shotty blast you gon' see the body bags
Men in black no Will Smith, real shit
Used to grind and we still grind
Beefing when we grill time, full metal steel time
Niggas getting stole on, tryna steal mine
Cock back, peel mine tape 'em up real time
Chubby, the mask on and beretta's bang
Sound clear holme? 'round here we gon' let it bang
