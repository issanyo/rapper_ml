[Intro: Styles P]
Oobie, let's go
You know I gotta do somethin' a little different
From the East but I'ma beast
I gotta release
What up to the G's
What up the suckas
It wouldn't be G's if it wasn't for suckas
Love to all
Ghost

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Niggas wanna speak my name, owe me to smack 'em
Make sure they don't speak the same
Lyrics crack the speaker frame
Joy lay beneath the pain
Ether in the vein, sick brain, yeah, Spain
So us niggas don't speak the same (we don't speak the same)
Thinkin' 'bout the path, you just thinkin' 'bout your sneaker game
Fuck about this industry, call me when that reefer came
Fuck about that top five, I'm just in that drop five
When I'm in it, you get finished
Hit that spinach like I'm Popeye
Catch 'em at that stop sign, hit 'em with that Glock nine
I'ma big boy [?]
Killer Mike, when them G's if you got time
You could die, he could die, we could die
Eye'll fly, teeth'll fly, but call me if you need a pie
We could put that beef aside, somethin' that is sweet
Put your street aside
Indeed am I super G, just bring a little weed to light
Don't talk about no rapper shit, somebody gon' bleed tonight
It's my house, a dead emcee is the deed tonight
Ghost

[Chorus: Nino Man]
All these niggas talkin' wreckless 'cause they see me flexin'
Reason why these niggas stressin', they don't count they blessins
Niggas swear they callin' shots but never send no message
We already got the answers, ain't no need to guess it
All these niggas talkin' wreckless 'cause they see me flexin'
Reason why these niggas stressin', they don't count they blessins
Niggas swear they callin' shots but never send no message
We already got the answers, ain't no need to guess it

[Bridge: Nino Man]
Ain't no guessin' over here, B

[Verse 2: Nino Man]
Don't tell me nothin', know all about it
Made the moves y'all thought about
Found my lane, they called it wildin'
Gotta fly myself, no autopilot
Heard 'em hatin', some of 'em smilin'
I was ballin', caught 'em foulin'
Makin' bread, you can't curb the violence
You said you pullin' strings? Heard the violin
They know I be freakin' mad birdies, daddy
Lookin' like a Weekend at Bernie's
Wit'cho bitch, she speakin' mad slurry
She can't wait to do your cheatin' ass dirty
Hey, it don't make no sense, tryna live free like I pay no rent
Tried to speak my mind but they don't vent
Niggas ain't got a clue and I ain't givin' no hints
I just want the bank rolls, [?] a game, think of Saint Row
Roll around a nigga, let the thang go
Shit rangin' in his face like Tango
Nino Man know all about it, if he outta pocket bet you saw us wildin'
Niggas be fake shinin', I saw the polish
Loyalty is a must, it's more than dollars

[Chorus: Nino Man]
All these niggas talkin' wreckless 'cause they see me flexin'
Reason why these niggas stressin', they don't count they blessins
Niggas swear they callin' shots but never send no message
We already got the answers, ain't no need to guess it
All these niggas talkin' wreckless 'cause they see me flexin'
Reason why these niggas stressin', they don't count they blessins
Niggas swear they callin' shots but never send no message
We already got the answers, ain't no need to guess it
