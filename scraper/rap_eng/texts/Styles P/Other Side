[Intro:]
I love my motherfucking brothers, my word

[Verse 1:]
If you feel right at the bottom
Your homie got killed and you praying God got him (pray for him)
Wishing you could shoot who shot him
You see them in the zone just know that the pack got em
Smile at the good look forward to the better times
Weed up there, look forward to getting heaven high
Peace sign to the sky, we’ll forever ride
See you on the other side, knowing it’s the better side (I see you)
I'll be down here lightin' pot
For niggas that got life and niggas that got shot
Niggas that rap nice but niggas would not pop
They never got signed but niggas did not stop (they didn’t)
It's pain in the vocals, more in the dubs and the ad libs
If you know where the path is
Road to perdition, the ride die
Nigga jump start the ignition and you done your trippin
Yeah

[Chorus:][x2]
Praying for my niggas on the other side
Represent your memory 'til the day I die
I'm trying to make it through the hard times
No matter what you're going through
You know you got to fight, fight

[Verse 2:]
Now you're down and you’re out cause you broke
And the motherfuckin' bills do you wanna merk somethin
Yeah, I feel you (I feel you)
But don't let that stress kill you
Light it, come up with a plan to make em feel you (come on wid a plan)
You can be broke, but not broke down (don’t break down)
There's a faith for your life and it's a close round
Ran to faith hold hope down, hope hold faith down tryin' to get it straight now (I’m tryin)
Let God, Imma need to say more, pray more, know I got sins I got to pay for (I know)
What you think I’d be lighting up the Jays for
I got a lot but I seem to want way more (I want way more
Struggle to make you stronger
So I keep the hunger just to last a little longer
That's why I stay reppin for the corners
Promise to keep it G, 'til the day I'm goner

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3:]
When you die, you wanna said you ate with your niggas
Basically saying break down your plates, you niggas
Or at least smoked an 8th with your niggas
You don’t smoke, then you should drink a case with your niggas
Tomorrow ain’t promised
Tryna make the best of today tho (try)
As long as you're breathing, you're okay though (you’re ok)
Light up the blunts get some more smoke
This is for the dead and alive and all the poor folk
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus][x2]

[Bridge:]
No matter, no matter
You gotta fight
Eehhhhh
Hey
Hey
Hey
Oooooohhhh
Yeah

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro:]
Oh oh yeah
Oh oh yeah
No matter, no matter
You know you got to fight
