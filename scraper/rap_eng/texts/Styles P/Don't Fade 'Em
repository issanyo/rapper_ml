[Intro]
There's an old saying in Tennessee
I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee
That says, 'Fool me once, shame on...
Come on. Get it right, George
Shame on you
Fuck, man
Fool me - you can't get fooled again.'

[Verse 1]
Ghost in the shell, yeah, I'm in my zone
Left for nothin' and bought a Benz back home
Safe from bank year that ends that loan
They ain't no the nine mil extend that loan
Killed the boys and put my men back on
Took off the shoes and threw my Timbs back on
Sharpened up, I got my gem back on
Workin' out, I got my wind back on
Don't save them, they don't want to be saved
Don't pay them, they don't want to get paid
Get the big guns, niggas want to get sprayed
But I thought about it, I don't want to see a cage
Ride around playin' this J. Cole shit
Niggas get halos from yayo bricks
Worked and quit, now, that's a payroll flip
Back in the hood we sling the same, old shit
Yeah, I know about it and you know about it
Pothole in the road, nigga, you go around it
Don't stop before there be a ho about it
Or you'll never get dough around it
No hoes on the inside, just hoes on the outside
And I'm Gucci on any South Side
They don't mind, get outlined

[Outro]
Yeah, they don't want to get the fade, don't fade them
Yeah, they don't want to get the fade, don't fade them
Yeah, they don't want to get the fade, don't fade them
Yeah, they don't want...
