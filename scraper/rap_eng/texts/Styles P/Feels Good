[Intro: Dave East]
Raised with the sharks, you lookin' for heart, you a scarecrow
East Side
Y.O
Harlem

[Verse 1: Dave East & Styles P]
Pablo and Peniro, the black version of Pesci and De Niro
Rare breed, this era a buncha fuckin' weirdos
Glock nine extender on it come with the air holes
Raised with the sharks, you lookin' for heart, you a scarecrow
Yeah, be the villain or die the hero
To keep it a buck, all my niggas started at zero
Your face on a t-shirt, maybe up on a mural
'Cause niggas gettin' money or steady duckin' the bureau
Now Givenchy and Louie V my apparel
Catch 'em at the light and we do that nigga like Harold
Menace to Society, hard time with sobriety
Got my notoriety from talkin' like it's God in me
Soul ain't for sale, ain't none of these niggas buyin' me
Hammer on the side, ain't none of these niggas tryin' me
Peaceful but I hit 'em with the iron, that's the irony
Three-piece Dior tux on, they admire me

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Payin' my dues, not one for losses
Gets to new levels, I'm just here [?] bossin'
My life expensive, don't care what it's costin'
Remember this, I'm forever flossin'
Yeah, I got what I got 'cause I earned that shit
It cost a lot when you live like this
Been through a lot just to get like this and feels like this
Yeah, it feels like (this)

[Verse 2: Styles P & Dave East]
Know that I plan to do it if I ain't did it yet
If I ain't weighin' money on trucks, then I ain't get it yet
You don't want the hammer to burn like a cigarette
I'mma need a couple of feet, you ain't my nigga yet
You a big homie, you turn Crip on the internet
Comin' out your face in traffic and bullets gon' intercept
Play the eight [?] hot in the projects as I begin to sweat
Black chicks servin' back and forth with no tennis net
Fly like we in a jet, let the iron fly like we interjects
Ignorant niggas full of that intellect
Niggas is food and my niggas didn't get dinner yet
Hit 'em in the [?] with the four 'cause we in the 'Vet
Been a threat, watch what you sayin' like you can't die today
Catch him while his family around him like it's a holiday
Two Ninas, three-hundred bullets, just me and Holiday
Sellin' green, I used to dream of makin' the powder play

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Payin' my dues, not one for losses
Gets to new levels, I'm just here [?] bossin'
My life expensive, don't care what it's costin'
Remember this, I'm forever flossin'
Yeah, I got what I got 'cause I earned that shit
It cost a lot when you live like this
Been through a lot just to get like this and feels like this
Yeah, it feels like (this)

[Outro: Kehlani]
I know I said it feels like this
And it feels like this
