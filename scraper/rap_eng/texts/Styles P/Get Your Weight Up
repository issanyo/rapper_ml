[Intro: Styles P]
Ghost
You know? (Whispers)
Bitch bring that weight up (hahaha)
Tryna knock it off, you dig?

[Chorus: Whispers]
I tell that bitch to bring the weight up
Ain't no need for you to wait up
I get a brick, we hit a stove and we could chop it
I guarantee we hit the road and make a profit
I tell that bitch to bring the weight up
Ain't no need for you to wait up
I get a brick, we hit a stove and we could chop it
I guarantee we hit the road and make a profit

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Niggas hit the road then the shit get cooked
Stay away from snitches, that'll get you booked
Last table lookin' like Christmas look
From the first to the third, know the strip for crooks
And the fifteenth too, I got sixteens too
I ain't goin' to sleep, I got big dreams too
Crib wit' a escalator and two more floors
Pretty girls, it's sawed-offs and four-doors
Ride around like it's Set It Off
Bitch, bring the weight up, I cook it up and get it off
Ridin' dirty on 95
I been ridin' dirty since '95
Nineteen that is, S-P, Glock 19
That kid hit the stove, chop it up, never seen that kid
By the way, has anybody seen my bitch?

[Chorus: Whispers]
I tell that bitch to bring the weight up
Ain't no need for you to wait up
I get a brick, we hit a stove and we could chop it
I guarantee we hit the road and make a profit
I tell that bitch to bring the weight up
Ain't no need for you to wait up
I get a brick, we hit a stove and we could chop it
I guarantee we hit the road and make a profit

[Verse 2: Whispers]
I'm on the road to the riches, 9-5 south, stay true
It's by the bitches on the hideout route
Every stash spot packed with a A-1 Felony
Pray I don't get caught in them K-9 scented V
Real nigga rollin'
If you maintain what's in your lane then you'll remain
Real niggas told 'em
These are the things that we obtained within the game
Got my bitch by my side though, ready for the ride flow
Different whips, switch, we equipped for the 5-O
Checkpoint, skip the checkpoint, no deal
Halfway, fuck a rest stop, no chill

[Break: Whispers]
I tell her, one trip, two trip, three more
Raised in the ghetto, you'll forever be poor
Teach it to the cops, say you'll never be shit
I swear I'm better off once I finish these flips

[Chorus: Whispers]
I tell that bitch to bring the weight up
Ain't no need for you to wait up
I get a brick, we hit a stove and we could chop it
I guarantee we hit the road and make a profit
I tell that bitch to bring the weight up
Ain't no need for you to wait up
I get a brick, we hit a stove and we could chop it
I guarantee we hit the road and make a profit

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Told that bitch to bring the weight up
Told the plug I buy half, you front half, real shit, straight up
Or somebody could get sprayed up
When B-M drop, I be pullin' the I-8 up
Forest green and all white lookin' like money but bet'chu it's on site
Shoulder strap on, the heckler is on tight
Koch hit a knot, the body is on ice

[Break: Whispers]
I tell her, one trip, two trip, three more
Raised in the ghetto, you'll forever be poor
Teach it to the cops, say you'll never be shit
I swear I'm better off once I finish these flips

[Chorus: Whispers]
I tell that bitch to bring the weight up
Ain't no need for you to wait up
I get a brick, we hit a stove and we could chop it
I guarantee we hit the road and make a profit
I tell that bitch to bring the weight up
Ain't no need for you to wait up
I get a brick, we hit a stove and we could chop it
I guarantee we hit the road and make a profit
I tell that bitch to bring the weight up
Ain't no need for you to wait up
I get a brick, we hit a stove and we could chop it
I guarantee we hit the road and make a profit
