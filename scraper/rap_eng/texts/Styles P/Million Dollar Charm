Million Dollar Charm

I can read dudes and that I'm telling you
I can see if you a joker its too ledge-able
The simple mind won't get that
Time is money there's no time for set backs
Its crazy what i do to people
If there's a tree of life i came from the root of evil
All i spit is venom like a snake bite
Upper cut pick you up like its date night
Million dollar charm with million dollar bars
I lived the struggle got a million some odd scars
Take a gamble got a team full of winners
Underground flow but never ran with the splinters
I never lose can't tell you how that look
All white Benz shit look like a mac book
Look me in the face there's no fear in these eyes
So much ice on my wrist you would think i freeze time

If your head ain't off of your shoulders
You ain't get shot, you got nicked nigga
Cause if my chrome hit a piece of your bone
It's gon' do more than chip, nigga
Yea, what the fuck is the problem
The Porsche is red the buckets is Army
30 shot handguns the gutter is starvin
Niggas like me might rush your apartment
Bloodstains'll fuck up your carpet, brain on the window
I smell murder every time that the wind blow
Tie him to the chair and then knock out his chin bone
I don't want the throne or the crown, I ain't selling up
You can have the jail or the ground, you ain't in hell enough
I'm the one that flood the gutters
Better tap your man, and let him know P'll love to cut his
And niggas is getting shot down, two guns up
Double R S.P. holding D Block down

Million Dollar Charm, Charm is worth millions
Fuck them niggas that doubt fire , Robin Williams
What you want from me no time for the fuckery
Can't shake my past cuz the pain is stuck with me
Bout that life ? well then meet me in the mosh pit
I'm bout to take flight sitting in the cock pit
Send me to a cage sour cream pringle smell
Tell the cops to have the nucleus put me in a single cell
Or a padded room in particular
Fuck it i just might walk in like Christopher
Cuz I'm thinking of man slaughter vehicular
And I'm known to ball testicular
Or something similar I'm out for the millions
Maybach off thew streets and all the civilians
Married to the game so i married the best
Where i learned to pull strings like a marionette
