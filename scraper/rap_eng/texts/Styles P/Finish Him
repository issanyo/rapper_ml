[Intro: Styles P]
Yeah, Ghost, D-Block
Yeah

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Grimmin' in the Reaper, drinking holy water after I smoke
Years to Ghost, cheated death
Met the devil and took a piss on his sneakers
Who these niggas think that they iller than?
Menagin with voodoo bitches, cookin' coke in the cop crib
It comes home, I'ma kill again
Yes, I'm in it for the thrill again
Which rappers lookin' to die, facts
Trapping leave you flatter than an iPad
You can send them killers to my bed
Next time you speak to they folks, it'll be the bypass
Cause I shoot fast and I drive fast
Makin' fast money and crime
This how the time pass
Catch 'em in the restaurant  shoot 'em right through the wine glass
Couple keys ain't no coke to me
A head nod'll get you poked for me

[Verse 2: Conway]
Look, you rap niggas not a threat at all
I don't feel threatened at all
I'm ten steps ahead of y'all (nice)
In the booth I'm a wrecking ball
Weapon drawn, wig shot close with the pump
And knock your head up off your shoulders
Shooters sniffin' coca up off a old 50's
The game scared of me like the old 50
Clap two niggas with my old blicky
Now I got the stick that bitch hold 50
Smell that stinch comin' from the bando
That's how they found the pussy nigga and his man though
I had to make a exempel
Niggas thought it was a game, I ain't playin' though
Spanish plug, Alejandro
Send a OG from San Fernando
Shit is finna get real
Two back to your head your whole shit spilled

[Verse 3: Lil' Fame]
Call me Fishroy De Mayo
Mafia style, end niggas careers
Hang 'em upside down, blood spillin' propell
I been runnin' these streets, long time [?]
Y'all niggas fucking with a killer straight loca
Flip a nigga house like a real estate broker
Far as the flow go, niggas know I been nice
My flow is crystal meth, you want thin ice
I did shows with Khaled he was screamin' 'we the best'
Came back to the hood niggas screamin' 'we depressed'
I know I'm still a back block nigga, leave a mess
My shit'll make a silverback gorilla beat his chest
Okay, that's a full alarm blaze
Callin' 9-1-1 that's a hoe alarm blaze
Brooklyn, this how a downtown swinger swing
Ain't nothing changed, y'all know what I bring
