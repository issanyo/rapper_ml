VERSE 1

I thank you mummy blessed for giving life and hope to me
My world, my heart, my life n everything I hope to be
Truely blessed, no regrets your my angel see
In my darkest hours mummy you were there help me see
First day of school remember you were there to see me thru
Even tho my dad was gone managed to keep US smiling too
Rest assurred when I'm grown I'll keep you smilling too
Always there, always strong, just what angels do

Your my angel
Your the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you pick me in your arms

Your my angel
Your the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
