Yea I stay low but you know im gettin high
Up on cloud nine when im dippin in the ride
Ghost or the phantom me-me sitting on my side
When im slipping when you slide
You could ride the wave but dont get caught up in the tide
Me im in the hotel quarter of that live lobster I and carp
We coulda went to war but johnny had a heart
Yea we coulda built but johnny had it smarts
Be a wise man or a live man
If you can expand then expand your time spend
You dont get the picture get a live cam
Rather hear a money machine than a nine blam
Yea ghost wild but im cooled out
Neighbors with the rich folks and I ain't trying to move out
Cause im only trying to move up
No aim from crack packs on the tool bus
Dope bags in the union cab
I ain't just rappin you salute if you knew the half
Youll recognize my stride if you knew the path
Youll recognize my pride if you knew the wrath
Cry like a lion got crew eyes hard wise
Blunt lit the only light we got on the dark ride
And im still on the dark side
Floor stove bright side of this shit im a boss tho
