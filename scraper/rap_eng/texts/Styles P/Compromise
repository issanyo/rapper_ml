What you offer is shelter
And your bed is a guarantee
Sure you know some good manners, yes indeed
And your kitchen is always clean
But you know it's a compromise

BECAUSE I NEED ALL THE SUNSHINE
AND ALL YOU HAVE IS "NO RAIN"
I WANNA GIVE YOU SOME PLEASURE
NOT MY LIFE
OH I WON'T TAKE THE REMAINS

I am growin' a custom
Which I'm not very proud of, to be clear
To remarkable waste of plastic
Time

BECAUSE I NEED ALL THE SUNSHINE
AND ALL YOU HAVE IS "NO RAIN"
I WANNA GIVE YOU SOME PLEASURE
NOT MY LIFE
OH I WON'T TAKE THE REMAINS
