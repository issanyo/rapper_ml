[Intro: P. Killer Trackz]
SP Killer
Yeah yeah yeah, L-O-X, L-O-X motherfucker
Niggas don't know how we bout to come this time
No more shiny suits
None of that shit

[Chorus: Sheek Louch & Jadakiss]
We gonna R.U double F.R.Y.D.E
Revolver, semi-automatic and a P.G
Hooptie getaway driver Breathe Easy
Explain things further
Murder or get murdered
We gonna R.U double F.R.Y.D.E
Revolver, semi-automatic and a P.G
Hooptie getaway driver Breathe Easy
Explain things further
Murder or get murdered

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Half of the hustle, half of them killers
All of them Niggas wanna kill Paniro
Better send the guerrilla's
Cause beef is like a brand new car
You better ride
Everytime I sleep I die
Wish I was gone (ya know)
Felt dumb when I was young
I used to wish I was on
I'mma stay blunted and red with one in the head
Niggas thinkin' they the don
Till their shit get bombed
I put 4 in your shootin' arm
2 in your legs
Like 10 in your chest
The last one in your head
I give you the whole clip
Like you cheated and stole shit
Knocked off the pack, flossed and no chips
You know the business
If he rat, kill your co-defendant
Keep it real and catch a body in trial
If you want a Nigga dead than do it Holiday Styles
Come with 2 guns up and empty both off the clips
Kill you whole fuckin' crew and go 'n smoke on the fifth

[Chorus: Sheek Louch & Jadakiss]
We gonna R.U double F.R.Y.D.E
Revolver, semi-automatic and a P.G
Hooptie getaway driver Breathe Easy
Explain things further
Murder or get murdered
We gonna R.U double F.R.Y.D.E
Revolver, semi-automatic and a P.G
Hooptie getaway driver Breathe Easy
Explain things further
Murder or get murdered

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Yo, yo, yo
I come to your town on a Peter Pan, no Jack
One pair of clothes, 2 O's and buddy at that
Wanna beef me?, y'all Niggas is borrowin' heat
Callin' all across town to borrow a 4 pound
Meanwhile this Nigga got his guns to your noggin
While your man with the heat is with some bitch up in the project
He clappin' at you, you duckin', makin' you dance
You should have spent it on some guns
Instead of Iceberg pants
What, L.O.X. off top, pullin' our triggers
With our guns on our lap, we ride around like Cali Niggas(WESTSIIIDE)
Target motherfuckers, cold hearted motherfuckers
Steadily young dumb your moms, and whoever she got with her
There's a new-born in the house
Then I'm killin' the babysitter
Y'all Niggas all clowns in Sheek eyes
Your moms should wear glasses
With the nose disguise around me
Talkin greasy
Y'all like watermelons
Big but crack easy

[Chorus: Sheek Louch & Jadakiss]
We gonna R.U double F.R.Y.D.E
Revolver, semi-automatic and a P.G
Hooptie getaway driver Breathe Easy
Explain things further
Murder or get murdered
We gonna R.U double F.R.Y.D.E
Revolver, semi-automatic and a P.G
Hooptie getaway driver Breathe Easy
Explain things further
Murder or get murdered

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Now if you know Jay
I ain'never been a brother to front
I be in L.A. wearin' any colors I want
Rock guns like shirts, Glock under the pump
And I put somethin' hot, anyone of you chumps
And I know a few of you wanna get my watch
But it'll be funeral if you get my watch
It ain't nothing y'all can do to stop the Lox' wealth
Run up in a gunstore, cop the top shelf
The Crack-game is dead, all they want is weed now
Chicks that I went to school with, a seed now
You know Kiss, stocky bald head, light brown
Ice down, in my roll look like nighttown
To all y'all lil' Jada's for the 1000th time
I'on't recall hittin' your moms or writin' your rhymes
And just because you might have seen me
In and out of your house
Is no way that she gon have a baby out of her mouth

[Chorus: Sheek Louch & Jadakiss]
We gonna R.U double F.R.Y.D.E
Revolver, semi-automatic and a P.G
Hooptie getaway driver Breathe Easy
Explain things further
Murder or get murdered
We gonna R.U double F.R.Y.D.E
Revolver, semi-automatic and a P.G
Hooptie getaway driver Breathe Easy
Explain things further
Murder or get murdered
