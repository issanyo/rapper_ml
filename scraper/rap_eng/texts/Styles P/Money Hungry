KMX Money Hungry Lyrics

Hook(X2)
My niggas money hungry yea we gonna get this green (get it)
My niggas money hungry yea we gonna get this green (get it)
My niggas money hungry yea we gonna get this green (get it)
My niggas get that money man by any means (any means)

[Verse #1 KMX]
I don’t fuck with niggas
Cause niggas move funny
Fuck food man a nigga hungry for this money
Fill it up treat my pockets like my fucking tummy
A nigga gotta get this chicken gotta ball like Griffin
Gotta ball like Pippen
Pussy nigga talk crazy then he get the Smith & Wesson
Make a bitch nigga learn his lesson
Nigga who the fuck you pressing
I know niggas are wankstas from my first impression
How you move dawg your whole fucking expression
Fake niggas man is that shit I don’t like
I’m the type of nigga to bring a bomb to a gun fight
And I’m always turnt up so don’t get hyped
Call fake niggas out they nowhere in sight
But they bitches are so they bitches gonna get piped
Man I run you fake trappers down for your fucking powder
50 don’t even know the fucking power of the dollar

Hook (X2)

[Verse #2 Styles]
Money hungry I’m starving nigga
Yeah just like Marvin nigga
Tryna get it by any means
Like the trade for Mello to the garden nigga
So pardon me, like the army be all you can be
When it comes to that money I stack it tall as K.D
I’m a fast lane hustler
You a slow lame customer
Tired walking of loserness
Yall niggas we don’t fuck withcha
I can’t mention if you don’t fuck with me
Deep down you wanna get bucks with me
What the fuck I look like paying for sex
When I could get sucked and fuck for free
Hoes I ain’t no comeup tryna use me like a escalator
See yall on the top floor take the stairs
I’m in the elevator
I’m the bomb with no denator
Flat line beats with no respirator
Niggas can’t fuck with me
So please do yourself a favor
Outchea we winning gotta rub it all in your face
Success is like a nut in your mouth how that taste?
You bitch get the fuck off my dick
First round draft picks
Get this money and that’s it
We hungry!
