[Intro: Styles P]
Prophet
Ghost
Yeah, nigga

[Verse 1: Styles P]
If Christ resurrected and came right now, bet a lot of niggas'll miss him and other niggas'll diss him
I'm givin' you game right now 'cause a lot of niggas is lost and others is in the system
If Muhammed came through in a kufi that's sky blue, with a Navy blue robe, would you follow him, Piru?
Should I build with the Gods since the Devils destroyed?
But niggas destroyed, too, when we never employed
I think, pain feel better than joy, when the valley low
But I hit my peak when I'm geeked up in Cali, though
Vibin' off the green, it's survival in my scheme
Is the good word dirty if my bible wasn't clean?
I ain't talkin' to the pastor 'cause it's faster when I dream
I be building with the sheck without the cards in my deck
'Cause the hand I was dealt just seems incorrect
We could talk about the other side, you wanna get in-depth?
But, you gon' owe me somethin', do you wanna get in debt?
Yeah, I'm somethin' like a scientist, the shit that I dissect
All love if it ain't, then it's blood on your Giuseppe's
He's a five-star, but he ain't come in with the set
Ghost

[Hook: Boog Jones]
It's rule to this shit, got to learn the game
Got to earn your name
Work on your craft, roll a wood, got to burn your pain
Life's a bitch and she expensive, got to work the game
Put your family first, go get this money and curve the lames
Got to learn the game, got to earn your name
Work on your craft, roll a joint, got to burn your pain
Life's a bitch and she expensive, got to work the game
Put your family first, go get this money and curve the lames

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Never seen clock hands made out of sands
But it's the sands of time
Sittin' in the hourglass, dance with the devil and you ate
Now you gotta fast, strong so you gotta last
Ever felt so much pain that you gotta laugh
Paid dues, throw your shoes on, yeah, you got a path
Build your enterprise, niggas is all desensitized
Kids gettin' killed and you worried about your mentions, right?
Well mention this, you can smell the stench at night
The beast out, tellin' my niggas peace out
Knowin' it's no peace out, might pull a piece out
Fuck about police, them niggas'll air your niece out
Your nephew, all of your kids, this shit's a cesspool
So I try to stay in the cut, lightin' the jet fuel
Basic, try to meditate so I could shapeshift
Above norm, meanin' I can only form greatness
Tryna shed light in the diabolical places
Souls everywhere, no chronological placement
Illuminati high, my weed jar is a mason
Travel agent P sendin' rappers on vacation
Fallin' to temptation, try your hand
Have your man lookin' up like, "why my man?"
Don't ask God, or ask him, ask me
Only way to pass me is to pass speed
Any rapper try me, that's his last deed
Extraordinary Gentlemen from the last league
What's a good bag of weed, if it got a bad seed?
You a crab, meet another crab by a crabtree
Do some crab shit cause y'all wouldn't understand me

[Hook: Boog Jones]
