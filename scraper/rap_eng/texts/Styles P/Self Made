[Intro]
Oh yeah
Hah
Vinny Idol, nigga

[Verse 1]
Stayin' around it 'cause time flies
Now where's the money that time buy?
Yeah, I'm always lookin' forward, God
But I'm recognizin' my hindsight
The mirror say I'm beautiful and wicked
If I'm talkin' to the plug, what's the ticket?
I ain't tryna kick it, I'm just tryna get it
Thinkin' about the bank account, how to add another digit
If we ain't breakin' bread and we ain't drinkin' wine and we don't smoke together, then you might get me lined
Maybe you describe me but only I define what I live and I stand for, I made my design
Ghost, nigga

[Chorus]
I am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind
Meetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line
Straight like six o'clock when I came with the nine
But then I had to grow, so I made my design
I am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind
Meetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line
Straight like six o'clock when I came with the nine
But then I had to grow, so I made my design

[Verse 2]
Tried to tell these niggas that I made my design
I'm a one-of-one, you was made on the line
Ever cross me, that's a blade in your spine
I'ma die a legend, you gon' fade with the time
But who am I to judge? It don't matter anyway
We the same energy, so you matter anyway
If I bust a fifty shot, they gon' scatter every way
If I hit a couple niggas, they gon' splatter every way
But I ain't on that time, I'm just really on the peace vibe
Tryna burn the leaf, make this money on the creep time
I'm a cold-hearted goon, anytime is heat-time
Earned a little money, homie, I'm just tryna keep mine

[Chorus]
I am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind
Meetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line
Straight like six o'clock when I came with the nine
But then I had to grow, so I made my design
I am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind
Meetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line
Straight like six o'clock when I came with the nine
But then I had to grow, so I made my design

[Verse 3]
Self made, self medicated
Ice cube, Rubik's cube, mix should be celebrated
The cold puzzle
I rest where your soul goes to sleep forever
You should know, Cuzzo
You fuckin' with the homie from the haunted house
I could talk to the night and bring the mornin' out
Related to the sands in the hourglass
It's happy G Day when the hour pass
Plant a seed of love when a flower pass
Always pay attention when the coward pass
I'm here to get paid with the times, made man
I told you that I made my design

[Chorus]
I am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind
Meetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line
Straight like six o'clock when I came with the nine
But then I had to grow, so I made my design
I am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind
Meetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line
Straight like six o'clock when I came with the nine
But then I had to grow, so I made my design

[Outro]
I made my design
Self made
L-O-X, D-Block
One third of the Trinity, S-P the Ghost
Salute
Love is love
One
