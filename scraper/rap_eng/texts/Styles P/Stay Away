Just gotta play your position, you know?
Whatever your position is, just play it
And that's it
Fuckin' simple, you know?

[Verse 1: Styles P]
You know he smokin' on marijuana
He's the Terminator, you Sarah Connor
You got shot, thought it's a badge of honor
Kust imagine what the shooter think
Know about it standin' on the block when you the link
The connect is my ace boom (?)
Caught a couple points off them joints that he gave to you
You ain't even wavy enough to wave to
He don't even get the deuce sign
Lame nigga, he don't even get the Boost line
Wack nigga, he be tryin' get the youth line (?)
God forgive me, know I'm wrong, hope they shoot him two times
Right in both kneecaps, sit him down, O.G.s give him feedback
You should get a job or a weed pack
Stay up off the block, you don't need that

[Hook: Styles P]
Stay away from goons if you ain't ready for wilin'
Stay away from guns if you ain't ready for violence
Stay away from courts if you ain't ready for silence
Stay away from me if you ain't ready for problems

Stay away from goons if you ain't ready for wilin'
Stay away from guns if you ain't ready for violence
Stay away from courts if you ain't ready for silence
Stay away from me if you ain't ready for problems

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Ever since Chi Chi got the yayo, swear to God that I knew I be a dope boy
Before I had Gucci on the label it was Ralph and I know I was a little boy
Had a pair of dope Nikes, yellin' out the dope fights to the dope heads that was standin' on the dope line
With the Queens to dealer for the whips straight cash fuck a co-sign
Nigga this is pro-time fuckin' with D-League
Get the Beamers with the b-bs, nines if need-be
Pull up the strip watchin' TV, back then shit was greasy
Stunt and get your wig clapped or your lil' nigga kidnapped
And you know I'm talkin' big facts
From a little nigga with big gats shit changed but I'm still playin' big
Can you dig that? Ghost nigga

[Hook: Styles P]
Stay away from goons if you ain't ready for wilin'
Stay away from guns if you ain't ready for violence
Stay away from courts if you ain't ready for silence
Stay away from me if you ain't ready for problems

Stay away from goons if you ain't ready for wilin'
Stay away from guns if you ain't ready for violence
Stay away from courts if you ain't ready for silence
Stay away from me if you ain't ready for problems
