[Intro: Akon & Styles P]
Konvict, Konvict
Let's do it, Khaled
Styles P, Konvict Music, Eh

[Chorus: Akon]
Hustle if you wanna, whatever you feel
Move that marijuana, fought faster in here
Trapped on the corner
Loaded with dum dums
Trafficking's normal
From where i come from
But five-O
Steady peepin around the corner, eh
Steady peepin around the corner, oh oh
Steady peepin around the corner, eh
Steady peepin around the corner
Watch ouuuut now

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Most of my money is dirty
Got it from a robbery or flying them birdies
Truck hijackings, big guns up in my jacket
And i don't give a fuck about rappin (watch out now)
Listen, chase people around the corner
Mob boss holdin' meetings inside the sauna
Had my men sweep for the bugs and informants
Turned myself in with a bail, I got a warrant
Niggas wanna rap about bricks
But never put a gram on a strip
SP the Ghost is enormous
If you nice like me put your bricks up
I'll beat you and turn my Benz truck to a pick-up
(watch out now)
Your homies gonna have to pour liquor
Get their T-shirts made cause the 4 gonna hit ya
And I ain't really tryin to be malice
You'll be MIA but not like Khaled

[Chorus: Akon]
Hustle if you wanna, whatever you feel
Move that marijuana, fought faster in here
Trapped on the corner
Loaded with dum dums
Trafficking's normal
From where i come from
But five-O
Steady peepin around the corner, eh
Steady peepin around the corner, oh oh
Steady peepin around the corner, eh
Steady peepin around the corner
Watch ouuuut now
