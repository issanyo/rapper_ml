Among evil gods I sleep
Their ancient hymns were my dreams
But the vast and cold forest beckons
So I rose with the funeral moon
From my coffin of blackest slone
From the crypts which for aeons
Embraced me
Through the portals and into the
Frozen night
It's calling for me
In darkness reborn
Through the midnight spheres I dance
Spreading my wings
Caressing the black infernal night
"From a timeless past I have risen to
Rule this kingdom of mine"
The eye of the wolves will guide me
Through landscapes of ancient black

I am eternal, I am supreme
I ride the nocturnal winds
Thy cry of ravens will carry me
Forth dimensions unknown by mortals
I am eternal, I am supreme
The nocturnal winds are mine
I descend into forests long forgotten
The naked trees united in perfect
Melancholy
And I saw spirits dancing
Swirling insane
The knowledge revealed to me
In darkness reborn
Through midnight spheres I dance
Spreading my wings
In the forest of pernicious black
Night is eternal
The sun is forever consumed
Embraced by the beautiful blackness
So sombre, so pure
