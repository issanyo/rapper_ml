[Chorus: Curren$y]
Never stop, 'til we pick up loot on every block
The roof of the crib got that helicop
Coupe move with new shoes and socks
Not to mention the masterpiece watch
Not to mention the chain or the diamond rings
Material things, wasteful, I know
But I just use it as a way to keep score, fo' sure

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Shit bigger than a 6 plus, this is us
The crew who you hide your bitches from
Jet Life homie, you tryin' to get rich or what?
Close the deal in a restaurant, power lunch
I had the veal with the parmesan
Bed of angel hair pasta it was resting on
Two mimosas, a to-go cup with Coca-Cola
Now I'm smokin', rollin', gas in my motor, sippin' my soda
We use the Pro Tools to break down boulders
My girl pull her own weight, with her sexy lil' shoulders
In the strapless Vera Wang, Alexander or whoever made it
I just know she paid it, it cost me Nathan
Sexy, cool, crazy
My baby like one of them hot 70's ladies
Under disco lights with her hips swayin'
To the music playin'
While I'm makin' major moves with the boss playas
Win or lose I was there, beginning to end
I paid dues so I'm included and you never knew it
Until you saw we did it you was still tryna do it
Lookin' at us lookin' like stars, and we lookin' at you stupid
Sucks to be you, kid... drugs in the music

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Boss playa, I'll ask what it cost later
Throw it in the cut like fuck it I'll floss later (fuck it)
In the mix like a cross fader
No DJ, givin' 'em no leeway (none)
We be everywhere from the mansion to the PJ's (hahaha)
Crown on the wrist, pound of the piff
Get around in the 6, ask the town I'm the shit (ask..)
But who's the niggas I'm shittin' on?
Come to money, you gettin' off or gettin' on?
You see that fly shit Spitta on (you see)
You see that fly shit Ghost on
The money and the weed, the guns and the Nikes
And the cars and the ice just might form Voltron (Voltron)
Or should I transform on 'em, they was goin' HAM on 'em
I was blowin' grams on 'em
They was showin' swag
I was blowin' bags full of strains
That niggas didn't never know they had (never, nigga)
It's Jet Life, I except life
It's not life 'til you come through livin' Block life
Carbon fiber stock pipes
I'm talkin' marble on the kitchen counter
You gon' smell like reserve if you sit around us (smell it)
Should I keep goin' or quiet up?
If you got fire, then fire up, nigga

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Never stop, 'til we pick up loot on every block
The roof of the crib got that helicop
Coupe move with new shoes and socks
Not to mention the masterpiece watch
Not to mention the chain or the diamond rings
Material things, wasteful, I know
But I just use it as a way to keep score, fo' sure
