[Hook] [x4]
Keep, me high baby [x3]
Ahhh, little bit

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Smooth, Oh yeah you remember
'Bout the time I'm finished this blunt, I'm going to November
Kardashian money, running like Bruce Jenner (Running)
Shooting like Otium, blunts on the table telling models to roll up
Jars full of kush, n' every bottle is swollen
Half from Morocco, penthouse spot
I got cash on the top floor
Jordache slippers n' no laws
Chicks in bikinis you never could go wrong
I'm just trying to show you my cool side
So I'm blowing the zip pool side
Keep me high matter fact keep me too high

[Hook] [x2]

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Keep me high, dutch lit, bamboo
If not I'm straight face like Ted Smooth
Vacation, no National Lampoon
Not Chevy Chase, I'm fetti chase
Blow a couple O's a day, I'm heavy weight
It's violet, listen love
Fuck me like a steward cause I'm high like a pilot
Red eyes, gremlins
Bar tabs Andre, 3000 Benjamin's
A hundred n' ten dutches
Eyes look chinky, I'm under the Louis Bucket
N' I know I'm stuck but I'm still saying fuck it
