[Producer Grandz speaks on cipher] Initially, we started out with this plugin called Alchemy. We got a whole bunch of sounds for it and presets. That one preset just stood out and just started flipping it. Once we got the preset and sounds, we added the drums

[Producer Grandz speaks on cipher] Yea, there's an 808. Another thing, we had to stack the drums a lot. The kicks are like three different kicks, the snares are like three different snares. Mesh them all together, EQ them, compress them, and just have them knock as much as possible
