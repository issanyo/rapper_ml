Styles P (Verse 1):
I'm too high to act normal, G to act formal, the game will transform you, watch for the word from niggas that word bond you, watch where you headed cause niggas will turn on you, classy Beamer wagon, I'm playing the firm on you,Yeah Nature and Cormega, plastic paper and pall bearers, pain in the street but we know that the Lord hear us, It's money we need to make but shit'll get funny if your friends act fake. How could fate have hate? I don't know, blow an eighth to the face keep smoking, keep drinking, I'm on the ride of my life so I'm letting the seat sink in, probably in the zone if I'm letting the beat sink in, aiming at your body I'm letting the heat seek in
Fortes (Verse 2):
Welcome to the syndicate, yeah I been in it, money gets printed and burned but time is limited. If you leave a legacy than it's infinite, all I think of is numbers, rhymes and businesses. I just want to be one of the greats, so I studied the greats and I dug in the crates. I don't pass weed, I smoke blunts to the face, weed from California what a wonderful state, always knew what to do with a scale, blowing money fast, drive that Subaru still..
Styles P: Wilin out fish tailing, test on I'm piss failing
Fortes: Even with a deal I wouldn't stop dealing, made her bag naked caught the bitch stealing, getting to a brick, sick feeling, bionic man, 6 million, back in the whip, 5th gearing
