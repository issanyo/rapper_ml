[Intro}
Yeah! Yeah we out of the game baby!
Tired of this shit!
Too many niggers ratting, no rules, no principles, no morals
What has these streets come to?

[Hook]
It's all good, it's alright (I'ma play it like the old timers do)
I'm leaving you tonight (I'ma slide on you niggers n go)
It's all good, it's alright (Get on my carriage or somethin')
I'm leaving you tonight (Cowards, not gon' rat on me)

[Verse 1]
I'm leaving the game, tonight I'm out
You can have my Glocks, my blocks, my chains
You can have everything except my name
And a couple pounds of smoke to keep me sane
I'm tired of this hustling, D-low and shuffling
Everybody suffering, think I need a buffering
Gunning with the Glocks, running niggers' blocks
But I got my own kids, all the sonning shit can stop
I don't think I'm all that, but I been doing dirt since I was 12 years old
I think it's time to fall back
Just trying to be a family man, chilling in the family van
Headed to the movie theatre, PG flick
Every time I open my safe I see these bricks
Every time I open my coat I see this clips
Start feeling stressed out so the weed get lit
And I'm thinking to myself that I don't need this shit
What!

[Hook]
It's all good, it's alright
I'm leaving you tonight
It's all good, it's alright
I'm leaving you tonight

[Verse 2]
Too many new faces (I don't know you?!)
I think niggers' wired, there's too many new cases
Before I go to jail I rather bow out gracious
Blunt to the face in a place that's spacious
Laying around sure beats a quarter for laying you down
Coz it's hard being pop and a boss
Everyday in my life revolves around my kids, profit and loss
If I ain't meeting with a teacher, I'm meeting with execs
Or I'm meeting with the pumper whose holding a street-sweeper
I'm thinking about quitting, I always got a headache
And my stomach started hurting I'm having trouble when I'm shitting
I ain't slept in a year, from reefer and beer
Plus I come from the hood where they creep from the rear
But I'm leaving tonight, breezing tonight
For some strange reason, my breathing ain't right
So I'ma pack my bags and leave on a flight
What!

[Hook]
It's all good, it's alright
I'm leaving you tonight
It's all good, it's alright
I'm leaving you tonight

[Verse 3]
I'm gone with the wind, I'ma hit the road like I'm touring again
Pack the family up, put em all in the Benz
Got some phone calls but I'm stalling my friends
I'll see them all in the end
I'm out like super-fly, I get super-high
Might as well quit while I got a little loot to ride
Can't go to jail, the cells ain't super-sized
Plus I'm stuck in hell in a place where you shoot or die
