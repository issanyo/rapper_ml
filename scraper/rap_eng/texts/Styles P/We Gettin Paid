[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
I know I'm, I know I'm gettin paid
I know I'm, I know I'm gettin paid
I know I'm, I know I'm gettin paid
I know I'm, I know I'm....

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
I still got money strapped in my clothes
Fucking with this trunk I got it won't close
Chain on my neck lit it up and just pose
Time on this watch I got just froze
Im an asshole you know how shit goes
Ball like derek top that just rose
Rolling with a bitch surrounded by foes
She should have been a star the way that bitch blows
Suicide somebody close the doors
But they fly like taking the trip
And the whip out of control taking a slip
Any jacker run up on me he taking a clip
If I hit the head he ain't finna get back up
Money in the duffle bag yeah its packed up
Should have been on rack city im racked up
Tell them im here to make a movie act up
Still king of the city fall back
Swag on some other shit like he all that
Everything a nigga roll in all black
Nigga if I ain't the truth what you call that?
I dont know but I know im still payin
Bang time, All hoes get played
All on a nigga head like a set of clippers
Never been no competition that I can't fade
Got money but im still trying to get more
In the club that I won't go
Fuck grinding im about the store
And put this dick up in ya ho then I gotta go
I I I ain't the one but ill show this paper
Fuck around and throw this paper
Till my flow can't be seen ima blow this paper

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
I know I'm, I know I'm gettin paid
I know I'm, I know I'm gettin paid
I know I'm, I know I'm gettin paid
I know I'm, I know I'm gettin paid

[Verse 2: Jadakiss (Styles P)]
In the hood with that iron tucked
In that trap but nigga I ain't stuck
(Lifes a bitch nigga that I ain't fuck
When it come to bricks nigga I buys 'em up)
Makin money im getting paid
Hitting bitches im getting laid
(Hiding out when the police gonna raid
Riding out when I lift that gauge)
Talking keys nigga get that way
Fans love me when I hit that stage
(Same book nigga different page
Yeah its purple but its different haze)
More pipes the insides are swayed
Yeah its custom I got that made
(Keep the blicky I got that blade
Keep the aces I got that spade)
Feel like B.I.G. when we spin that bone
Cop the bricks nigga get that home
(Got the bitch nigga get that dome
Cop the 6 you niggas crippin chrome)
You dont touch me when im in that zone
Dog is hungry ima get that bone
(Coke is yellow an them bricks is good
The wizard of Oz can't get you home)

[Hook: Trae Tha Truth]
I know I'm, I know I'm gettin paid
I know I'm, I know I'm gettin paid
I know I'm, I know I'm gettin paid
I know I'm, I know I'm gettin paid
