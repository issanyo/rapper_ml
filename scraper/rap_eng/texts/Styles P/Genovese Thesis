[Hook: Styles P]
Shit revolves like the doors in jail
And the more I try to get is the more I fail
You know the the tale, power is in the dollar bill
Heroes die, cowards get killed, everything is real
Shit revolves like the doors in jail
And the more I try to get is the more I fail
You know the the tale, power is in the dollar bill
Heroes die, cowards get killed, everything is real

[Verse: Genovese]
Seems like the day turn to night so quick, life passin'
The hole we in massive
Narcs knock one of us the next day come thru laughin'
So we just mathin'
Out the possibilities 70/30 they getting rid of me
Start it in the Halla, feel like my father
Cock the Glock 1-9 back it’s time to honor
Joey Geno -v-c-o-k-e-d up on the balcony

Slick back hair two chokers, Gucci loafers
Had his own table in the Copa
Cabana had Jerry in the fiend
Snitch ass tried to knock the whole fucking team
Beat him till he cried like a bitch Like Santorra did at the bar
Can’t stand a fishy Rats is risky
Working wit the boys
My consigliere ol’cat wit poise

Soldiers none older than thirty living dirty
Keep the silence on, don’t disturb we
The people, no sequel, we re’ from
Mean we used to, now we get Columbian, sip Seagrams
“On the rocks”, Bellomo passed the polygraph
Now the chances of beating it is cut in half
Been in the can since June, send him home soon
Back to Calabria we robbin ya
Hit 'em with the doe before he leave LaGuardia

Have a nice Christmas your Padrino
Stack mad greeno in the Beemo
Had the 44 on the flo’, Seen Charlie big nose
Walked with a case of Mo’s, had puttana’s in both Yukons
Had a feeling they was bulletproof
Checked it out long black joint hit the roof
And bounced off the sounds off
Remember that always the doe lays

On the table till we sort it, coke lays there since we bought it
Ignore it, best things afford it
Your weight is nose grams, we be bouncing in the Roseland
Strength of this fam like Conan, where no man
Could get in or get out, 1500 a night in the penthouse
Suite, retreat, never on the feet
In the Lincoln’s wit the big heat
We dig deep holes for those that’s speaking

Creepin on the weekend to Key Largo wit Margo
Half Italian half Yardy
Two shades darker than me
Her neck icey, sip wine but she love to eat ackee
And saltfish, teen tears runnin from the Tauras
Fat Rog and Billy now applaud this, enormous
Gigante glass to glass wit Spumante
Cheers when I go I leave it all to Brigante

Shit revolves like the doors in jail
And the more I try to get is the more I fail
You know the the tale, power is in the dollar bill
Heroes die, cowards get killed, everything is real
Shit revolves like the doors in jail
And the more I try to get is the more I fail
You know the the tale, power is in the dollar bill
Heroes die, cowards get killed, everything is real
