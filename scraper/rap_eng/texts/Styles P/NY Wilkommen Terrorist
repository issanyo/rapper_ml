Sometimes to be complete you need a rocket plane
To fly against the buildings of a town
He found the perfect love on a four-engined grave
No one will ever know she had no doubt
Don't you know that you're so beautiful?
Don't you tell me that I'm beautiful?
Don't you know that I'm a terrorist?
That's it one last kiss / rest in peace
BREATHE THIS TIME WE'RE TRAPPED INSIDE
I KNOW IT'S ALRIGHT TO LOSE WHEN YOU FIGHT
Believe or not the young guys were not scared at all
'cause both they knew there is a reason why
To keep your love beside you just one second more
To keep your love beside you when you die
