[Verse 1: Styles P]
Fuck that nigga, fuck him, knew he pussy
[?] on his balls, [?] shooters pussy
You think I'm rapping, I'm just saying what I do to pussies
Real life, real talk, my hawk'll go through the pussy
You don't know shit about that murk work
You was just saying killer shit to make the verse work
I ain't knocking you, but end up in the wood
Box a hospital when them hollow tips start to pop at you
Yeah, it's turned up, but don't turn up dead
Cause niggas'll pop lead from their burners
And that fuckboy shit don't concern us
Rough shit, ghost on a [?] to blow shit

[Hook: Ransom]
Pussy nigga? Fuck that nigga
He pussy nigga? Fuck that nigga
My niggas don’t trust that nigga
These bitches don’t touch that nigga
They know he pussy nigga
I'm screaming fuck that nigga

[Verse 2: Lore'L]
Nigga, you a pussy, pussy period, a pussy
I'm coming at your cookie and I'll squeeze if you push me
Nigga please, ten Jesus peanuts, thirty-four deez nuts
And I never give two fucks, fucknigga
My crib bigger
Attitude rude, where my motherfucking liquor?
You are what you eat, pussy, pussy, pussy nigga
Fuck you and anybody that you know, nigga
And anytime I show out, we making niggas mad
Owl gang, bitch, here to fucking toe tag
Tag popping, I'm popping
Car shopping, order all the options
Niggas talk tough, but be quick call to call the cops in
You pussy nigga

[Verse 3: Ransom]
Pussy nigga, rookie nigga
Me, I'm built like Tookie, nigga
You, you more like Snookie, nigga
Don't push me, nigga
Got no class, played hookie, nigga
You rode past when they took me, nigga
I throw cash at that cookie, nigga
I got love for them strippers
They got love for them tippers
You just a thug in them pictures
Me, I'll bust a slug at your mistress
Ain't no fucking love when I spit this
That raw shit, don't cross this
I'm heartless with no conscience so be cautious
When I toss this in your office with that four fifth
Forfeit or get forclipsed and get lifted like a forklift
Or get twisted like a crawfish
Pussy niggas, you stuck with 'em
I'm celibate, I don't fuck with 'em
I tell a bitch, I don't trust women
I settle this when that slug hit 'em
