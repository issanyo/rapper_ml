[Verse 1 - Jadakiss, Styles P]
[JK]
Keeping it gangsta
How many men could you kill?
[SP] Let me count all the bullets I got
[JK] Many bricks could move
[SP] You can say 20 a block
[JK] Many niggas'll ride
[SP] You could fill a football field
How much money you got?
[JK] You think I signed a football deal
[SP] My nigga give me the word, I'm gonna kill that lame
[JK] You know major league niggas play the kidnap game
Have the kid missin' for days, listen and pray
[SP] And I'm kill 6 of your niggas 6 different ways
And we still got XL rhymes
[JK] Still gangsta
[SP] Try to run up on the guy, I'll send your legs to your mom
[JK] And we still got kilos of coke
[SP] Ruff Ryders to the death, ride or die nigga we know the oath
[JK] That's why I'm tryin' to send this metal through your head
Cause you got me curious, you probably look better when your dead
Nine by the spine, (fifth in the holst)
Scum bag it's them D-Block boys, Daddy, Kiss, and the ghost
[SP] Comin' through like the "Matrix" in the A-6
Triple black leather, six-speed, with the gray stick
[JK] Give me the safe, I spit at your face
Double clip in your mug, then have SP hit it with mace
[SP] And we just caught burners and do me I'll say this
[JK] Your little niggas lookin' up to me like the walls in Green Haven
Keep heat and we shank ya
[SP] rob ya and say thank ya
[JK] Now that's keepin' it gangsta (keepin' it gangsta)

[Hook - Fabolous]
Ya'll know who
Keepin' it gangsta
We come through
Keepin' it gangsta
Ya'll know how we do
Keepin' it gangsta
My whole crew
Keepin' it gangsta

[Verse 2 - Fabolous, Paul Cain]

[Fabolous]
We your favorite gangstas' favorite gangstas (PC: and duke better bolt)
Before these slugs sink in his waves like anchors
We don't own clean guns
[PC] All our skets is dirty
I toss bullets, New York niggas jet like Testaverde
I don't keep the scope on the ratchet
For the dope I'll attach it
[Fab] Make sure the joint aim point blank so they can't open your casket
My whole crew (got Glocks on 'em)
In a hurry to shoot, (like they put shot clocks on 'em)
All that gossip you blast, better see if they possibly has
A V12 ambulance that get you to a hospital fast
[PC]
They let Cain out the cages and shackles
I ain't call a pager to track you
I'm loadin' up gauges to whack you
We been riding together
And us back and forth
[Fab]
It's like putting Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden together
Soon as you get a crumb, they wanna bury ya
That's why I travel with a semi
Like Eddie in "Coming to America"
[PC]
Silencers, it sound like it's humming when I'm airing ya
Won't know you hit 'til your body numbing in that area
[Fab]
The kids don't want to see the toast to mom and daddy
Plus we rather be roasting trauma fatties
In a toasted almond Caddy
[PC]
And we come through, with chains glisten and thangs spitting
Hollow shots'll leave your brain missing
[Fab]
Ghetto F A B (and Paul Cain nigga)
We gettin heaps of complaints for keepin' it gangsta (keepin' it gangsta)

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - M.O.P.]
[Billy Danze]
Hey yo, we represent them down ass niggas
M.O.P. rip rounds at you clown ass niggas (ALL DAY)
BK nigga get up off snooze
Don't make me put your gangsta on the 6 o'clock news
You ride in a what, don't get it fucked up
Or twisted, cause you'll get it twisted and fucked up
And die in that truck
(Be cautious when your walking through, be careful who you talkingtoo, comes the boom)
It's the livest motherfuckers of the century
You niggas is killing me, you got to be kidding me
Ain't nobody taking it and making it
Extra like dust, throwing they ass on the record and bless it like Gus
Now about them weak flows, keep those, we eat those
As far as heat goes, we keep those, the street knows
The M.O.P. is what's up
We in the cut, Brownsville is heating it up (COME ON)

[Lil' Fame]
Your ego, I still spit lines at your bitch
Play Ceelo, and spit four five's at your six
You don't really wanna lose your life
So I'mma smack flames out ya, pick ya money up and roof ya dice
Yo, you done know were we from
Soldier come soldier jump
Soldier, you bee found in your whip slumped over
With your gangsta ass, dead and your gone
Iced out, chain out, with ya brains out, head on your horn
You know who be keepin' it gangsta
With a truck full of goons that fakesta
And the Brownsville niggas from the past
That run up, put a hammer to ya gut, and tell ya drop it in the bag
You gangsta, ha whatever (haha)
Cause for real if I ever ever
Ever ever catch yo ass flippin'
I'm gonna pop a collar
Woo mack and when your bitch holla

[Hook]
