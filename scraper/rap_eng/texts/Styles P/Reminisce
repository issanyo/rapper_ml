My Karma's no good. Stay in some drama, lil' mama, lemme' know it's the fact that I'm so hood. I don't tussle with somethin', I'm hustlin' somethin'. I don't care about your man dawg, fuck 'em he frontin'
Motherfucker better tuck in his chain..or I'm robbing one..
Have me in jail? I'mma' buss' on the chain
Like all my niggas suffer from pain, start cuttin' the 'caine, feels good to switch your guts into BRAINS. YEAH!
Get the picture, lil' nigga? I smoke haze, drink a lil' liquor, still move a lil' quicker
Put a kit on whatever I cop. Put bricks on EVERY block; let off 70 shots, motherfuckas' gotta BEG me to stop
I'mma' boss nigga kiss my ring, drop-top benz, fish in Manhattan, I could miss my plane
But I'm in D-BLOCK! Bloods, Crips, and Kings!
Tell your man I get horrible with it. I got a gun that always beg, watch these slugs try ta' borrow ya' fitted
And I'm five times better than all of the top five. Give em' five shots from the fifth out the drop-five
D-BLOCK bark a lot, bitch come and stop by!
Big ass bottle of 'gnac
Violate, and I betchu' swallow a hollow from outta' the gat
I don't know what I'mma' sell, but I'mma' go ham (hell) with an L
Think 'bout my niggas sittin' in jail
Fuck with P? That's like touchin' a rail
Third of course
Guns go off, then my word's enforced. Understand that I said my word
I don't be rhymin' funny, cause time is money, you know the clock and the bird
You can catch me ontop of the curb
Skys the limit, I need a flight to the top of the Earth. I'll kill every New York rapper verse for verse
And they oughta' pay me tithes like I'm parta' the church
Cause they ain't did no dirt, or put in no work
Tell ya' man I said FUCK HIS LIST (FUCK THAT NIGGA!)
If P ain't on top, he can SUCK MY DICK!............... YA KNOW?!
