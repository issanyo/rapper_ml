Zebra fucking Katz

[Verse]
I’m feeling you feeling me
How you feeling? We're fine
I think it’s working, the potion is infiltrating our minds
The beat sets off into motion and then our bodies entwine
We lose control to commotion and then fall backwards in time
“I’m having visions, we tripping,” whispers the voice of the heathen
The night it thickens - black Wiccans
Tick-tock, our heart skips a beat and
You take a second to breathe in and then our energies deepen
And then we vibing, we creeping into the darkness, we’re reaping

[Bridge]
I love it when we do it like that, that
(Into the darkness, we’re reaping)
Yeah, when you shake it like that, that
(Into the darkness, we’re reaping)

[Hook]
I love it when we do it like that, that
Drop it on the floor and bring it right back
Spin around the world and twist it like that
Shake that ass and make the fat stack
I love it when you dutty wine, wine
Get on top and grind, grind
Do your thing just take your time
Do your thing just take your- your cent

[Outro]
(Cent) 5 cent 10 cent dollar
(Cent) 5 cent 10 cent dollar
(Cent) 5 cent 10 cent dollar
Go on, gone  off
Make me holler

[Repeat Verse]

Into the darkness, we’re reaping
Into the darkness, we’re reaping

[Repeat Outro]
