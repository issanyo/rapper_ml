Winter titties
Vanilla soft-serve
He’s on fire
Watch him blaze and burn
She’s really hot
She’s sizzling
Reached a boiling point
And now her pussy’s giving in

No nobody you don’t want none
Red fox carry her a big gun
Little dark spirit in the black night
Life flowing blue in the black light

Winter titties
Vanilla soft-serve
He’s on fire
Watch him blaze and burn
She’s really hot
She’s sizzling
Reached a boiling point
And now her pussy’s giving in

Electric zoo
Fox hoof zebra
Wolf [?]
Teen-wolf mix it up
Foxes reading bitches

Run like the [?] zoo’s coming

Winter titties
Vanilla soft-serve
He’s on fire
Watch him blaze and burn
She’s really hot
She’s sizzling
Reached a boiling point
And now her pussy’s giving in

Don’t kill the funk
Because it’s you I’m hunting
I see you with
You’re out fucking
Come and get you some
I know you smell what’s cooking
Loaded zebra
Take a sip of soup

Winter titties
Vanilla soft-serve
He’s on fire
Watch him blaze and burn
She’s really hot
She’s sizzling
Reached a boiling point
And now her pussy’s giving in

Winter titties
Vanilla soft-serve
He’s on fire
Watch him blaze and burn
She’s really hot

Reached a boiling point
And now her pussy’s giving in
