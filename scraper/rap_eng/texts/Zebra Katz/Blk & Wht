Black
White white white white white
What haunts you?
What haunts you?
Zebra's coming for you

3 2 1 now tell me are you ready for me
In tune to your body steady hot and heavy
In groove we move all around the moon
Then soon we’ll swoon nebula in June
In zero gravity I’m falling for you rapidly
Get a grip drift back through the galaxy
Then we dip space ship hyperdrive we speed
Gamma-ray ultraviolet it’s just you and me

I think that we could save humanity
Just think, yeah, we could form a colony
On a planet where we fuck drink and love in peace

‘Cause that other human’s earth
Wasn’t made for you and me
Wasn’t made for you and me
Lips kiss soft then we lift off

Good god all mighty
The devil just tried me
Put a price on my soul
Told me a story
Tried to control me
Said I’d die all alone
As far as I know
Non-aggressive
We [?] our flow
I could sense your timidness
Let it go

Oh you cocky and you feeling this
I think you might be into this, so
Speaking through the demons
Through this really nice instrument

Black
White white white white white
What haunts you?
What haunts you?
Zebra’s coming for you
