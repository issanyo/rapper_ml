[Verse 1: Rag'n'Bone Man & 2-D]
You can be mad at me, tell me I was born to quit
I was checking gold
Or you could just freak with me
Said it again, let the numbers roll
I hear that about you, baby
It's back when the city's cold
(It's cold, cold, cold)
Don't ever look at me like that
It's just in the daylight, no
It's just in the daylight, no

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man & 2-D]
(I am a mirror)
I am a broken screen
I'm a mad routine
That's just patterned out
And I'm over it
(It's cold, cold, cold
I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
And you don't know me
I am over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)

[Verse 2: Ray BLK & 2-D]
Why are you mad at me? Tell me I was born to quit
I was checking gold
You should just freak with me, freak with me
And let the numbers roll
I'm here by the fire, I'm waiting
Back where the city's cold
(It's cold, cold, cold)
Don't ever look at me like that
It's just in the days I've known
It's just in the days I've known

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man, Ray BLK & 2-D]
(I am a mirror)
I am a broken screen
I'm a mad routine
That's just patterned out
And I'm over it
(It's cold, cold, cold
I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
And you don't know me
I am over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)

[Verse 3: Zebra Katz]
Yo, new black king, New York dream
Tell these motherfuckers everything I'm seeing
My world's darker than the young black dream
Of the first black prince of a new white king
I just wanna play, have it my way
Make a bunch of fucking rules, then tell 'em obey
They can't fuck with me, yeah, yeah, Ojay
First name, government? No, him, I slay
New black king, oh
New black king, yeah
New black king, oh
Uh, obey, obey, obey

[Chorus: Rag'n'Bone Man, Ray BLK & 2-D]
(I am a mirror)
I am a broken screen
I'm a mad routine
That's just patterned out
And I'm over it
(It's cold, cold, cold
I am a mirror)
I am a distant voice
I'm inside your head
And you don't know me
I am over it
(It's cold, cold, cold)

[Outro: Ray BLK & 2D]
(Mirror)
I'm a broken screen
(I am a mirror)
And I'm over it
(I am a mirror)
