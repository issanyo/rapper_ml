Eyes closed as we just sway in dance
Low grind through time like my last chance
No fear on my mind that was me in the past
Got my bass so loud might wake the dead
Lips meet shotgun, in straight through the head
Rotate to the right and we did it again
Strobe light, shine bright, white lightning flash
Hands up in the air, keep shaking that ass

Walk up in the club
Grabbing drink, get the gun
Money on my mind, paper-chasing all the time
Haters' gotta hate but best believe I'm getting mine
Bitches on pay, hella fly
Bitches never thought that I would get so fly
Bitches never thought that I would get so fly
Wake up in the morning light the blunt, get the gun
When I see a hater I say "Hi hater, bye"
Bitches never thought that I would get so high
Bitches never thought that I would get so high
Wake up in the morning wipe the frost out of my eye
When I see a drink, motherfucker I tried

Wanna, run 'er I'ma coming
Motherfuckers ain't telling me nothin'
Ain't running on my huntin'
Lil' bad little bitch see me coming
Wanna run 'er, I'ma coming
Motherfuckers ain't telling me nothin'
Ain't running on my huntin'
Lil' bad little bitch see me coming

You bad bitch wanna ride
Come on [?] baby, get inside
Take a second, it's your last breath
Welcome to the dark side
You bad bitch wanna ride?
come on [?] baby, get inside
Take a second, it's your last breath
Welcome to the dark side

Eyes closed as we just sway in dance
Low grind through time like my last chance
No fear on my mind that was me in the past
Got my bass so loud might wake the dead
Lips meet shotgun, in straight through the head
Rotate to the right and we did it again
Strobe light, shine bright, white lightning flash
Hands up in the air, keep shaking that ass
Yeah
