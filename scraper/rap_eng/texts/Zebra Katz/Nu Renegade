I dare you
Alright

I want it all
Everything
Opulent mother fucker
I own everything
I’m about that
Catching all that life
Then ditch that
Yeah, bitch, alright
Living the life
Shilling like a villain no strife

Right now
I’m with my cats
We’re in the back
We’re wearing black
And we got it like that
I’m with my cats
We’re in the back
Wearing black
Like that

Did you see us?
See a black cat
Don’t run baby
Don’t fight back

Now
Kitty kitty cat
Here kitty kitty cat
Oh

Wake up in the morning
Rub a blunt dab a dime
Money making
On my mind
You wanna be a model
On the street
Pop star
New York dreams
New icon
On that runway
Get it girl
It’s your way
I’m on the catwalk
In a dress

[?]
I’m a throw rain
I’m a bring the shade
Piss into lemonade
Bad bitch getting paid
Bad bitch getting paid
I’m a throw the shade
Bitch drink lemonade
I’m sipping ice
Bitch I’m getting paid
You can see me
You can see me laid
Drinking lemonade
Just throwing the shade

Uh, I’m the new wave shit
Black wave
Nu renegade
Nu renegade
I’m the new wave shit
Black wave
Nu renegade
Nu renegade
Nu renegade
Nu renegade
Nu renegade
Nu renegade
Renegade…

Bad bitches
Throwing shade
Bad bitches
Throwing shade
