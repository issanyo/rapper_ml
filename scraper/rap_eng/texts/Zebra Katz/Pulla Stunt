[Verse 1]
You can see me when I see you
No bitch in my lane, I’m rolling right through
Motherfucker’s insane, can’t fuck with my crew
Ain’t a bitch in the camp can make them say, “Ooh”
Did you see that? Did he bleed that?
Superstitious motherfucker running from the black cats
In the back of the alley where my game at
Jump in motherfucker, you can feel that

[Hook]
Ima pulla stunt, Ima fuck the cunt
Ima upend a motherfucker running amok
Two shots in the breeze when the bang get buck
That’s honey to the badger, I don’t give no fucks

[Verse 2]
Calm yourself, bitch, please
Inhale, fall back, [...] you catch your breath - ease
Been that, yeah bitch, I did that
Black cat in the hat rolling with the baddest
All attack we strapped, all eyes on our back
Reddd Foxxx by my side with the loaded MAC
(Chopped and screwed:)
When we trip, we stripped, all eyes on the deck
We fucks with [?] with the [rolling mat?]

[Hook] x 4
