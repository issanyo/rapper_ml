I'm gonna tear this house up (4x)

(Chorus)
I'mma tear the house up and get down on this beat
Tear the house and get down on this beat
I'mma tear the house up and get down on this beat down on this beat, down on this beat
I'mma tear the house up and get down on this beat
Tear the house and get down on this beat
I'mma tear the house up and get down on this beat down on this beat, down on this beat

(Verse 1)
Yo let's go way way back to the basics
Damn motherfuckers really just can't take it
Sippin all around they wanna bite wanna taste it
I'm that cat yeah I'm the black cat
I'm that bitch that does it like that
You don't got to say it cuz the cat got ya tongue
I ain't gotta say it cuz bitch i get it done

Tell me what you did what what chu done done
What you ain't know it? Muthafucka i'm the one
What you ain't know it? Muthafucka i'm the one
Naw none these bitches in the back want some
I'm the new young darkling with a dirty city kitty
Bad to the bone school fish looking pretty with it
Nope nope, the girl can't cope
Yes bitch i know you dope
Brr like a polar bear pussy ice cold

(Chorus)
I'mma tear the house up and get down on this beat
Tear the house and get down on this beat
I'mma tear the house up and get down on this beat down on this beat, down on this beat

(Verse 2)
Tear the house and get down in this bitch
When i'm up in your city burn a pound of good shit
Pop champagne cuz i'm getting hella pissed
My big black so please sit back i'm gonna eat
Put it on your plate, hungry bitch? eat
Don't feed these pigeons cuz they shit where they eat
I'm the underling king of the dark world thing
I'm the darkling thing of the dance floor thing

Come wanna play with the kitten from the street
Bang bang with the kitten put the stripper on the beat
Known to rock the mic you know I could never not leave it red hot
Oh no now they're begging me to tear it up
Oh no now they're begging me to tear it up
Oh no now they're begging me to tear it up
Oh no now they're begging me to tear it up
Now they're begging me to tear it up

(Chorus)
I'mma tear the house up and get down on this beat
Tear the house and get down on this beat
I'mma tear the house up and get down on this beat down on this beat, down on this beat

Let's go way way back to the basics
Damn motherfuckers really just can't take it
Sippin all around they wanna bite wanna taste it
I'm that cat yeah I'm the black cat
Yeah I'm that bitch that does it like that
You don't have to say it cuz the cat got ya tongue
I ain't gotta say it cuz bitch i get it done

Tell me what you did what what chu done done
What you ain’t know it? Muthafucka i’m the one
What you ain’t know it? Muthafucka i’m the one
Now known to rock the mic you know I could never leave it red n' hot
Oh no now they’re begging me to tear it up
