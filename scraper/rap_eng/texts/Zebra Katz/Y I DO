Oh shit, I slipped
I hit it, hid it, and quit it
I flip-floped the rythmn
And drop kicked the script
I prolonged the middle
And climaxed the dip
I hot boxed the whip
And I'm happy in it bitch

It all started with a sip
And it turned into a kiss
With her hand around her face
And her arm around her hip
We embraced a hot taste
I'm a beast I need to mate
Batter up up to the plate
Then I slid up into space
Then I slid up into space
Then I slid up into space
Batter up up to the plate
Then I slid up into space
Then I slid up into space
Then I slid up into space
Batter up up to the plate
Then I slid up into space

I don't know why I do it
Why I do the things I do
I don't know why I do it
Why I'm doing things to you
I don't know why I do it
Why I do the things I do
I don't know why I do it
I'm just doing me boo
I'm just doing me boo
You should go and do you too
Why I do it
How I do it
I wouldn't be telling you
How I do just what I do
When I do just what I do
And I do it, I do it
I screw it then it's fucking through, ugh

How I do it, why I do
Why I do it, how I do
How I do it, why I do
Why I do it, how I do
How I do it, why I do
Why I do it, how I do
How I do it, why I do
Why I do it, how I do

Why I'm doing all the lonely things I'm doing
Why I do the things I do
Why I do the things I do
How I do it (the things I do)
Why (the things I do)
How I do it (the things I do)
Why (the things I do)

I don't know why I do it
Why I do the things I do
I don't know why I do it
Why I'm doing things to you
I don't know why I do it
Why I do the things I do
I don't know why I do it
I'm just doing me boo
I'm just doing me boo
You should go and do you too
Why I do it
How I do it
I wouldn't be telling you
How I do just what I do
When I do just what I do
And I do it, I do it
I screw it then it's fucking through

I don't know why I do it
Why I do the things I do
I don't know why I do it
Why I'm doing things to you
I don't know why I do it
Why I do the things I do
I don't know why I do it
I'm just doing me boo
I'm just doing me boo
You should go and do you too
Why I do it
How I do it
I wouldn't be telling you
How I do just what I do
When I do just what I do
And I do it, I do it
I screw it then it's fucking through, ugh
