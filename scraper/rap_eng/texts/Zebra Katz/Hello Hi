[Intro]
Hello
Hello
Hello hi
Hello hi
Hello hi
Hello hi

[Verse 1]
Hello hi are you the one
The one I've been searching and waiting for?
I've been looking for you for so damn long
Couldn't numb the pain with the hit from the bong
I'm going through the motions and it feels so wrong
And I daily catch a feeling so I wrote this song
In a hotel room overseas on tour
Where I'm feeling myself 'cause I'm all alone
I don't know where one day it hit me
Hanging by his room, thinking love had skipped me
Where's my mind I'm a god damn Pixie
Arrow didn't stick, I'm surprised you picked me
Yeah Yeah I admit it, this might sound crazy
[?] in the [?] I fall so quickly
Wait, wait a minute, can you hear me now?
When my signal's weak and it's in and out
Oh my god, I think I found
Found the love to hold me down
Come through show you
What it is how it do
Get lost in the moment when I think of you
I was [?] in my bed 'till my dreams come true
Don't know, we never have to keep it on the low
Maybe soon we can meet up off the phone
Get you out of my mind and in my zone

[Hook]
Do you really love me
Like I really love you
If you really love me
Tell me what you gonna do
Do you really love me
'Cause I really love you
Do you wanna touch me
'Cause I wanna fuck you

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's been a minute, let me get back in that
I was speaking in tongues 'til my third verse in it
Now I'm going ape dumb 'til I bust and get it
Better wrong come come if it's sex we're winning
Say a prayer for the boy, ho, life is sinning
Sip a gin, hit the nip, now his head's a-spinning
Hold up, just a second, let me tell my vision
All I see is motherfuckers bringing up opinions
Oh me, oh my, well well, I guess
Am I the realest or just a test
You can be the diamond and I be your rock
Went in from the heart spoken from the cock
Didn't mean to rush, I know I need to stop
On my third message, damn am I blocked?
Text from the source, sending you a blessing
[?] we in the presence, ponder my question
I love my shit, yeah I swear I do
If I love myself, would you love me too
I mean I love my shit, I swear I do
If I love myself, would you love me too
'Cause I hate myself when I'm not with you
See me down when I'm out and I'm black when I'm blue
If it don't feel right then it can't be true
'Cause there's nothing I can do when I think of you

[Interlude]
Ladies and gentlemen
We are now approaching our final descent
Please buckle your seatbelts
And thank you for riding with ZFK  and [?]

[Verse 3]
Face to face, no time to waste
Tongue trace your body 'til it finds the space
Rotate your waist, longer our pace
Lips meet in place for a warm embrace
It was J, Jane, and me, rolling in the G
F.U.C.Katz.I.N.G
First came J, then came Jane
Then came Zebra, ain't a damn thing changed
It was J, Jane, and me, rolling in the G
F.U.C.Katz.I.N.G
First came J, then came Jane
Then came Zebra, ain't a damn thing changed
Ain't a damn thing changed

[Outro]
Hello hi are you the one
One I've been searching and waiting for
I've been looking for you for so damn long
Couldn't numb the pain with the hit from the bong
Now I'm going through the emotions and it feels so wrong
I've been daily catching feelings so I wrote this song
In a hotel room overseas on tour
Where I'm feeling myself 'cause I'm all alone
