[Zebra fucking Katz]

[Triple freak sound core]

Some of these tricks
Ain’t at the right
Tell ‘em pack for a trip
Put ‘em on a flight
I’m a send ‘em down south
Before they start to bite
No beef in the house
With the flow so light
These bitches getting sad
‘Cause they’re catching my light
I’m a bind that witch
Bring the doctor to light
‘Cause I’m feeling real good
Then I’m doing it right
But they never get mad
‘Cause a basic bitch might
I’m like platinum and gold
When I’m up in your mouth
Fall back in my soul
And let me hear you doubt
I see you shivering, shivering
Like you needing [?]

Shake that ass if you wanna
Shake that ass if you like
Cast a spell if you wanna
Mix that potion just right
You can hate if you wanna
‘Cause I’m coming right through
Yeah, I smoke the best fish
And I’m bringing my crew

Drop to the floor bring it back up pop that
Shake it in place wait for the base move back
Hand in the air wind up your waist two step
Giving them face whipping your hair hit that

Drop to the floor bring it back up pop that
Shake it in place wait for the base move back
Hand in the air wind up your waist two step
Giving them face whipping your hair hit that
