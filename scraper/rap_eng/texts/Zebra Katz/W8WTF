Hold up, wait, what the fuck
Am I really really dreaming
Don't know, fuck, I'm fucking cuffed
I ain't even blunted but my mind is stuck
Don't remember how I got here
But I do the bump

The champagne tastes a wiff of willow raw
The blonde finna sell me to a new restaurant
Yeah you think I'm cray
I'm sitting in the black back of a witch's hut

Hold up, wait, what the fuck
Am I really really dreaming
Don't know, fuck, I'm fucking cuffed
I ain't even blunted but my mind is stuck
Don't remember how I got here
But I do the bump

Feel a chicken head peck
Hearing pigs grunt
Smell of something brewin
Like a batch of bitches tongues
Inhale a little deeper
I even smell a hint of a bit of cut

Hold up, wait, what the fuck
Am I really really dreaming
Don't know, fuck, I'm fucking cuffed
I ain't even blunted but my mind is stuck
Don't remember how I got here
But I do the bump

Can't be mad, if you don't see me
Tribal painting black faces hella schemin'
Zorces up above
Protect me from these demons
That's just tryna fuck me up

Hold up, wait, what the fuck
Am I really really dreaming
Don't know, fuck, I'm fucking cuffed
I ain't even blunted but my mind is stuck
Don't remember how I got here
But I do the bump

Hold up, wait, what the fuck
Am I really really dreaming
Don't know, fuck, I'm fucking cuffed
I ain't even blunted but my mind is stuck
Don't remember how I got here
But I do the bump
