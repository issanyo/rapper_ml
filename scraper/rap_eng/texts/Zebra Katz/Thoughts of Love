[Verse 1]
Something's up in me
I feel so shallow
It's so deep and I'm like
Doing all the things that I know I should be doing
Thoughts are not of a kind
The only patience is my time
And I have every little thing
But there's something that is missing

[Bridge]
I've seen the blue skies and rivers
Hold hands with the stars above
Running on empty, my prides are low
With nothing but the thought of love

[Chorus]
One shadow on the wall (wall, wall, wall, wall)
Baby this time don't miss the fall (fall, fall, fall, fall)
Yeah, we all grow old
But all your riches will make you poor
The highest power, we hit the floor
Without that love

[Verse 1]
Cause I've been feeling so
Scared for step at a time
I've been waiting my whole life
I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna feel the perfect stranger (yeah, yeah)
Make me remember you
Let this heart feel something new
You give something to hold on to

[Bridge]
I've seen the blue skies and rivers
Hold hands with the stars above
Running on empty, my prides are low
With nothing but the thought of love

[Chorus]
One shadow on the wall (wall, wall, wall, wall)
Baby this time don't miss the fall (fall, fall, fall, fall)
Yeah, we all grow old
But all your riches will make you poor
The highest power, we hit the floor
Without that love

[Bridge]
I've seen the blue skies and rivers
Hold hands with the stars above
Running on empty, my prides are low
With nothing but the thought of love

[Chorus]
One shadow on the wall (wall, wall, wall, wall)
Baby this time don't miss the fall (fall, fall, fall, fall)
Yeah, we all grow old
But all your riches will make you poor
The highest power, we hit the floor
Without that love
Without the love
