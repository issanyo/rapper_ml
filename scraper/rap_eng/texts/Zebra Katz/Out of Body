[Intro: Kilo Kish]
Pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
We're here tonight for a very special offering
An offering of our spirits this evening in unison
But first, a word of instruction

[Verse 1: Kilo Kish]
Hello, hello
Please leave all your belongings at the door
You can sit or stand, we can take a vote
And just tiptoe to the centre of the circle
While we unveil the ropes
Still a little room left to hang your clothes
Some of us are new here, we'll take it slow
Ready, set, go
I lock hands with yours
We dive into the floor
When we reach the core
Then we stomp some more
I lock hands with yours
And then we dive down into the floor
Seven thousand miles 'til we reach the core
And then we circle back and we stomp some more, got it?
It's just like that
You promise all your life, then you turn your back
You glide across the space, and diagonal past
Then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back
You move your hips and your arms like a cat
Spin three times, and you're back where you're at
Does anybody catch what any of this is about?
No? Well, work it out

[Chorus: Zebra Katz]
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright

[Verse 2: Kilo Kish]
Okay, slide like a lizard, bark with the crowd
Eyes dilated, dark to the grass
Then when you find you're invisible, you melt into a puzzle
Keep it flowing like the rivers do
You gotta pay attention to the motion of the fish
Stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss
And if you lose your way, it's a cold black abyss
Don't take the chance, not worth the risk

[Chorus: Zebra Katz]
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright

[Interlude: Kilo Kish]
Who knows?
There's always stains on what's real and true
Tonight is a special, special occasion
And all that's left for us to do, is move

[Bridge: Imani Vonsh√†]
Ooh, I, I
Where am I going?
What am I doing?
I, I'm alive
Alive
I can fly
I, I'm so alive
I'm so, I'm so high

[Verse 3: 2-D & (Zebra Katz)]
(Everybody)
Everybody says I'm busted and blue
I feel better when I don't need that
Everybody gonna funk the night
It's so big, big, big
Everybody says that I'm more
Feelin' out of body, I'm drinkin' it up
Can I tell you what the dream's about tonight?
(Dance floor packed and I'm feeling alright)
