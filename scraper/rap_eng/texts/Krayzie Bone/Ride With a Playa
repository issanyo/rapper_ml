Hey (hey, yep, yep)
This is dedicated to the niggas that's mad at me
Keep 'em in back of me
Knowin' they after me
Keep 'emin back of me
Surely, in back of me
Way in back of me
You should come ride with a playa (playa)
Stay away from bustas, sucka-free
Niggas been slippin' on Ken D-A-W-G
Got 'em, right back at 'em
With some platinum shit

[Ken Dawg]
I suggest you bring the game with ya
And end it all, it's Ken Dawg
Roll with 'em, spittin' (What?)
Just deliver what's on
Yeah, these losses had me
So constantly it keeps my mind spinnin'
Caught up with green (green)
Game and fine women (and fine women)
Since the beginnin' of thangs
These tables start turnin'
You really ain't focused on me
It's just on what I'm earnin'
I learned to come up (come up, yeah)
Bring my stack up (stack up)
Brought a 'Lac strapped up (strapped up)
'Yac in my cup (cup), blowin on the sack
What? Act up, playa, we do it real
Miss me with the bullshit, and keep it real
Stop fuckin' with these squares
Just ride with this playa (with this playa)
If you feelin' this shit
Just put it in the air

(Chorus: Krayzie)
You should come ride with a playa (playa)
Stay away from bustas, sucka-free
Niggas been slippin' on Ken D-A-W-G
Got 'em, right back at 'em
With some platinum shit

[Ken Dawg]
Which category are you in?
What's your story when you sin?
Blame that shit on your friend?
I tell them hoes, "I'm in to win."
That's why my name's Ken Dawg
I been raw, high always
Schoolin' these sucka-ass niggas all day (all day)
Let me pull up on the phone (phone)
Honk the horn, tell that ho I'm gon' be gone
She keep my ?, slashin' at me, smackin' me
Everytime she catch the 'Lac off in the public eye
She watchin' me like a bat
My real niggas ride with me, dippin' (dippin)
Times is crazy enough
You don't wanna take no strippin' (strippin')
Just keep it at ease, keep 'em on they knees
Hustlas get cheese, niggas got mouths to feed

(Chorus)

[Ken Dawg]
You know the word can get around fast
Who bring the heat (heat, heat, heat)?
We goin' back to back these lames
'Tll they P.O. or fall asleep (what?)
Got my soldiers ready (what?)
I told ya, hold it steady (what?)
Just control my fetty (what?)
Don't be cold and sweaty (what?)
The game so deep, you gotta know who really wit' ya
Or who out to get ya
You got to be that much slicker
Picked up the game from the street
My older peeps, pimps who got them
Hoes out there makin' ends meet
Ken Dawg, I'm a stone-cold playa
You niggas bumpin' this
This is another one of them Mo Thug hits (Mo Thug hits)
Blow it down, and smoke, try not to go broke
Feel the rapture of the real
Over some shit that I wrote
Ride, ride, ride

[Krayzie]
You should come ride with a playa (playa)
Stay away from bustas, sucka-free
Niggas been slippin' on Ken D-A-W-G
Got 'em, right back at 'em
With some platinum shit
Hey (hey, yep, yep)
This is dedicated to the niggas that's mad at me
Keep 'em in back of me
Knowin' they after me, keep 'em in back of me
Surely, in back of me
Way in back of me
Come ride (come ride, come play...)
With a playa (...with a playa)
Come ride with a playa
Come ride with a playa
You should ride...
