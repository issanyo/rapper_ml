[Verse 1]
Better back up off me dog
You better not get too close
U don't wanna get too bold
The rhythm, the rhyme, is mind control
The grit and the grime; that's Mighty Mo
All competition has gots to go
Lock and I load the flow
Cock and unload my glow
Spit 'em the deadliest venom they'll ever experience yo
Lyrical pro
Still got a criminal glow
Hit 'em with a critical blow
Singing most subliminal, oh no
As if a nigga really don't know
We hit it for sure
When they ask how fast I go
I tell 'em like H2O
Steadily willing and deadly now
So tell 'em to listen to my battle cry
Nigga my methods too wreckless to handle
Too treacherous to fathom
It's best ya don't get your death wish soon answered
I'm one of the baddest, illest and maddest MC's are there never
Will there be another rapper this clever?
Cause nobody does it better
Murda murda murda murda mo
Still active
It's still maddness
Still I pack that steel, still will blast it
I'm back and I'm giving 'em what they've been missing
Stop ! Look ! Listen !
Them niggas ain't coming back after this one

[Hook]

Apply the pressure, pressure, pressure (8x)

[Verse 2]
We coming for battle, we sent to attack em, we stay on the offense
And we coming to murk all the non-sense
With a flow that's so deadly conceiving myself that it's haunted
And the rhythm is conscious
All of you rappers are harmless
So we treat them like garbage
Not even considered artist
Really they fraudulent
Not hard to hit
So pause with that
Come over here and get all of this
But suckers that's faking, That's all you get
I'm breaking the pressure, Your palms is wet
Cause I'm the shit
When I bomb ya clique, ya click
My nigga your dead
So cancel the ambulance
Send them a hearse
Lyrical armageddon, dead nigga you had ya chance
Now I gotta get 'em with the math flow fast
If y'all really don't wanna know, don't ask
When they try to keep up with the song, don't drag
I never stop, I just roll past
Put your weight on it, lay on it, stay on it
Let ya'll play on it, I take it back now cause Kray own that
Murda mo, Murda mo, they don't know I kill a...Bitch
With a style so beast I labelled it gorilla
Stop (Stop) Look (Look) Listen (Listen)
Them niggas ain't coming back after this one

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I look at my competition through a microscope
Before I kill them on the microphone
Hit 'em with a hypnotizing tone
I'm ready to fight and deny my throne
To any rapper trying to play in my lane
Around the block, a nigga got aim
You outta my state but still in my range
So tryin to escape is only in vain
And I know my craze
It's hard to contain
I'm like a disease
That spread through the veins
Blow harder than a breeze
I'm more like a hurricane
You heard me, man?
I'm leaving you niggas like Razzle Dazzle
In the battle I'm leaving them babble, hear rattle
With a style so natural
It's classic just like afro
Through the back door I creep up on 'em
Pull out my heat then bust on 'em
Lick shots to the beat, dump dump on 'em
Go home cause you don't want it
So many niggas that try to get with it but they never make it, they fall
I'm taking it higher, they ain't on my level, Kray Jack ain't got time to be dealing with y'all
Still the killa (Still the killa)
It's still all about that murda (Bloody murda)
The bloody bloody murda
Stop (Stop)
Look (Look)
Listen (Listen)
Them niggas ain't coming back after this one

[Hook]
