[Intro]

I've been all over the world still can't find my place
I've been all over the world still can't find my place
So I've been getting bored
I've been getting bored
I've been getting bored getting really really bored


[Hook]

I want to build a brand new place a brand new town a brand new face
I want to build a brand new place a brand new town a brand new face
I want to build a brand new place a brand new town a brand new face
I want to build a brand new place a brand new town a brand new face
I want to build a brand new place a brand new town a brand new face (A brand new everything)
I want to build a brand new place a brand new town a brand new face (A brand new everything)

[Krayzie Bone]

I wanna go to another level where humans have never been before
No body can break me concentration im in my zone
Nobody can fade me or hate me cause i got my own
Livin life in paradise so I can chill now
Need no more fakers around so we can all be real now
Nobody thinkin none of us claim my niggas still down
Everytime we pull up beside us this life is real loud
So let me take my mind to a brand new place
And gather the souls to take to a brand new town
Let me rearrange and change my game face
Switch up a style create a brand new sound
Am I perfect? on my mind I know im not perfect(perfect)
Am I perfect? on my mind I know im not perfect(perfect)

[Hook]

I want to build a brand new place a brand new town a brand new face (A brand new everything)
I want to build a brand new place a brand new town a brand new face (A brand new everything)

[Bizzy Bone]

Couldn't imagine that lady like him and that
And even the matrix from the bacon streets a simple match
Now let me shoot the dice I hope nobody try to catch
I've gotta fresh flash of dreams and even that
Shine gleaming at minano where is thy water at
Why is the water black? (yeah)
Your angels good on my leader he be feeling that ya ready set lightspeed get the staff
When there is no one left this is what i seen at death
Like in the streets of paeson and edens cleff
Man thats all and I need some more rhythm yup must be the thoughts building kingdoms in my inner depths
Volcanic cover since we levitate get the rest
Untill the babys grow as slaves
Watching centre flicks
Im to the moon alice fuck it i bought my crew a palace
Hop in ready to see the sun we be loving it buddy

[Outro]

I want to build a brand new place a brand new town a brand new face (A brand new everything)
I want to build a brand new place a brand new town a brand new face (A brand new everything)
