Ain't no otha rappa doin it like Krayzie Jackson

Like a nine, I'll blast ya mind wit these lines
I leave em all hypotize to my vibe

And if tha opposition come, Ima stop em on tha one
Bust one time

Leavin everybody stunned, they gotta have it
It's jus that platium magnet
What make you so attracted

See, Ima tha kind that'll slide to ya mind when ya ride to tha rythem, rythem
Tha kind that'll spit and ain't scared to get wit em
Tha kind that'll get they head
And we split em
You hear these words and tha styles, I kill em

A one hit wonder for sure, sure
