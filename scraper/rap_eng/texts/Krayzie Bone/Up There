[Chorus: Krayzie Bone & Lord Infamous]
Up there, up there
Smoking that bud will get us up there, up there
These trees will get us up there, up there
Them green leaves will get us up there, up there
Where we wanna be is up there, up there
Smoking that bud will get us up there, up there
These trees will get us up there, up there
Them green leaves will get us up there, up there

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Lost in the smoky, mighty reefer
Nigga just like Colt 45, it works every time
Me and Three 6 Mafia, we smoke and ride with Hypnotize Minds
Thugline, nigga roll it up and let's smoke one
Hey, did somebody say weed?
Nigga, that's my thing, I love it
Puff it every day
Shit, if it wasn't for the reefer pleasing
Easing my mind, nigga, I'd be wilding
Talking 'bout a nigga with a attitude
If I don't smoke, then I ain't smiling
I ain't eatin and I ain't sleepin and I ain't fucking with no broads
If I ain't weeded, can't let them stress my mind
I'll get with ya'll later when I get high
Shh, listen, hear my brain as it fry
I'm jus like a junky when he get his fix
Nigga be relieved when I get my shit
Ain't nothing like that Cali green
Or that Miami weed
Prefer my trees; no stem, no seeds
But you got good stress, I'll take dat
Smoking, choking, keep me 'noid, but eyes wide open
And I'm scoping while I'm toking
On this potent shit we're rolling, ho

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone & Lord Infamous]
Up there, up there
Smoking that bud will get us up there, up there
These trees will get us up there, up there
Them green leaves will get us up there, up there
Where we wanna be is up there, up there
Smoking that bud will get us up there, up there
These trees will get us up there, up there
Them green leaves will get us up there, up there
Where we wanna be is up there, up there
Up there, up there

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
You know, naturally, I'm hype-hype
Down in Memphis, oh, we smoking on that light-light
That's gon' keep you mellow
Bud gon' have your eyes tight
I dare any fellow to smoke on this all night
You gon' to have to tell your friend to come and get ya
Roll that blunt up, dog, and pass it to me mister
If you feel you can't hang with these sessions
Stay your ass up off the [?] with your guessing
All you doing, man, is wasting our blessing
To you non-chiefers, that's bullshit you're stressing
Telling me to quit-a smoking this green-green
It just calms me down and lately keep my game keen
Man, this greenery is made for inhaling
Soon as smoke enters my lungs, then I'm sailing
To a place where all you heard is your vocab
Project Pat I'm on this track going up there

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone & Lord Infamous]
Up there, up there
Smoking that bud will get us up there, up there
These trees will get us up there, up there
Them green leaves will get us up there, up there
Where we wanna be is up there, up there
Smoking that bud will get us up there, up there
These trees will get us up there, up there
Them green leaves will get us up there, up there

[Verse 3: Mac E]
Pass me the motherfucking blunt, man
Hurry up or else somebody's gonna get sprayed
Cough and choke on the weed is just what I've done
I hit it again and then blow my niggas a gun too
We're smoking all the time is how we're doing this
It's not a day of smoking the ink that I'm gonna miss
We getting high as a motherfucker as it seems
While chilling out on the strip called Orleans
Me and one of my road dogs had kicked it kinda tough
While we was at the Low-Key
Me and them folks could've sworn we're touching the bottom of the damn angel's feet
Man, we partied like some rock stars
While we're [?] in my joint
If y'all wanna know what we was getting high on
It was that goddamn funk
Sat there kind of frozen
With them straws up to our noses
Bought some ink to slow our roll
And popped some V's to help [?]
I ain't gonna speak this shit no more
So hit me once 'cause it ain't no more
You shooting that gal, you better watch your dough
I'm Audi 5', I'll holla, ho

[Outro: Mac E]
If y'all wanna know what we was getting high on
It was that goddamn funk
If y'all wanna know what we was getting high on
It was that goddamn funk
If y'all wanna know what we was getting high on
It was that goddamn funk
If y'all wanna know what we was getting high on
It was that goddamn funk
If y'all wanna know what we was getting high on
It was that goddamn funk
If y'all wanna know what we was getting high on
It was that goddamn funk
If y'all wanna know what we was getting high on
It was that goddamn funk
If y'all wanna know what we was getting high on
It was that goddamn funk
