All you get is one life one chance nigga you don’t get no advance
One past so you better make it last young man
But your decision was to move with the criminals do what the killers do
Follow the leader is what niggas do
At minimum little nigga you’re penitentiary bound
Or worse in a hearse just another mystery now
He wanted to be a young thug a young thug
He wanted to get rich quick so he slung drugs
You know the story everybody want that gangsta’s glory
They wanna ball they want it all they brain distorted
Until the Feds hit em and then that’s when they vision gets clearer
The man in the mirror done figured out that life is much realer
Police scream freeze you pull your pistol and you squeeze
Cop dropped to his knees you drop your 40 then you flee
Now the whole precinct chasing behind him
He better keep running cause if they find him they gonna remind him
Nigga die die nigga got you bucking and ducking
100 miles and running they coming you better keep stompin’
Don’t stop and think they bluffing cause they gonna lay you in a casket
Blast past your head while you dashing through the alley
Running for cover there’s hella helicopters that hover
Another brother to fucking tell the coppers we don’t love em
Empty your clip while you jumping the fence
All of the sudden you get hit and you remember

[Chorus] 2x
All you get is one life (One life)
One life (One life)
All you get is one life (One life)
So you best just live your life
Right

[Verse 2]
Hey young world
You’re just a young girl
Already somebody baby momma the dumb girl
That’s in and out of all the players’ ride letting all the players ride
That’s how she chase that paper (paper)
13 going on her 4th abortion no remorse for orphans
Of course the question is you must don’t really love your life
Your mother must have never loved you right she said that daddy only hugged at night
When he was high but mama didn’t care
She needed you there just to receive your welfare
Heard she got a new boyfriend she call him daddy
But I knew the time exactly when he pulled up in the Caddy
But hey what did she expect she met him on the Internet
Let me guess “Baby I can make you a star”
But then he said “Bitch better have my money”
And all your dreams turned into a nightmare (nightmare)
The light’s there (light’s there)
Right there (right there)
Too late for you to wake up and to figure out this ain’t the life that you want

[Chorus] 2x

[Verse 3]
Toil in the jungle too far from a coffin
Who can you call when the heart has been darkened and murder’s the only option
Nobody care if you’re living or breathing
No one was there is the number one reason you thinking of leaving
Even smoking weed sippin on Hennessey tryna ease the pain
The yak attack the brain get you amped and past insane
You believing thinking you ready to die better off dead than being alive
Use your head that’s the devil telling you lies eyes on your prize
Better not let these demons catch me sleeping believe me they creeping
Now it’s the season to pledge your allegiance
This ain’t your real life got just a little while longer
So fix your life and stand stronger
I (I, I)
I don’t wanna die (die, die)
You don’t wanna die (die, die)
I don’t wanna die (die, die)

[Chorus] 2x

[Outro]
Yeah
Forreal man
I’m tryna live
TL
That’s right
You only got one life to live
And these are the days of our lives (lives, lives)
