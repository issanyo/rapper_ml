(feat. Noose, Asho)

[Chorus: Akon]
How many days we gonna live our life
Strugglin' on the streets?
How many ways we gotta live our life
Searchin' for a way to eat?

We gotta, stay down, stay down
Just to see a brighter day
Stay down, stay down
Just to live a better way

Stay down, stay down
Just to live a brighter day
Stay down, stay down
Just to live a better way

[Verse 1: Noose]
I been in the struggle and no I ain't leave yet
It's gettin late, and still I ain't eat yet
Warrants in the mail but I ain't tryin to read shit
I don't wanna rob him but I really need this
I'm gettin' skinny man, don't make me squeeze this
I gotta be the crook but I don't really mean this
Tryin' to see a better day, I can't see shit
It's dark around here, it's hard around here
Get murdered for nothin' when the gun spark around here
Reach for ya gun and see stars 'round here
In the hood you die young, we starve 'round here
We stuck; can't say farewell to welfare
When that check come, best believe we bubblin' drugs
To go buy yourself a gun and with a box of slugs
So they won't morph you for your 1's, or your air force 1's
It's that way, can you feel a nigga comin' from the slums?

[Chorus: Akon]
How many days we gonna live our life
Strugglin' on the streets?
How many ways we gotta live our life
Searchin' for a way to eat?

We gotta, stay down, stay down
Just to see a brighter day
Stay down, stay down
Just to live a better way

Stay down, stay down
Just to live a brighter day
Stay down, stay down
Just to live a better way

[Verse 2: Krayzie]
I'm startin' on this colt 40 bottle
Cause problems just seems to follow me
Around like I'm the father of drama
And it's all a part of me
Like it's cloggin' my arteries, Livin this hard life
Strugglin is in my blood so I'm pissin' out hard time (alright!)
Now where can I shine, nigga?
I been humble for years and I still ain't got mine
I put in red blood, sweat and tears
And I'm still on my grind
Nigga I'll put this on my kids
They gon' give me what's mine
(Sure ya right, Know I'm right)
But, nigga, late-lay
I been feelin like niggas really been tryin' to play Kray
But they not, no, nah, nah
This for my brothers who struggle 24-7
Who stressin' and all you know is the troubles
God could ya lend us a blessing?
Cause we could use some helpin' down here (down here)
It's hard to get some rest around here (around here)
We seen a lot of death down here
How long will we be left down here?

[Chorus: Akon]
How many days we gonna live our life
Strugglin' on the streets?
How many ways we gotta live our life
Searchin' for a way to eat?

We gotta, stay down, stay down
Just to see a brighter day
Stay down, stay down
Just to live a better way

Stay down, stay down
Just to live a brighter day
Stay down, stay down
Just to live a better way
