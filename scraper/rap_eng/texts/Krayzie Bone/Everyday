[Intro]
Bone, Bone, Bone Thugs (Ooooh, how we do it)
Bone, Bone, Bone Thugs (It's all about the music)
Bone, Bone, Bone Thugs (It's all about the music)

[Hook]
Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
They tellin' me criminals be crazy and would it be reason for the brutality
They killin' these niggas in cold blood, Bone Thug been a part of the reality
All the insanity, they know who humanity, whatever happened to family?
Lost mine way back in the game, back when the crack came
It ain't to much change to this day seems like it's never
Gon' get better (better)
Forever get the love and peace (peace) "Day's of our Lives"
They keep on gettin' shorter every time that I realize
That it won't be too long before
We wake up and the world
Is gone, and it won't mean no, world war
It'll be Armagedon for sure, for sure

[Hook]
Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

[Verse 2: Wish Bone]
Everywhere we look there's so much violence, violence
And I won't makin' no bet, I'll quit the riots, riots
And you ain't gotta lose, it's all about the roads that you choose
But what is there to do when your brought up and stung like ooh
And I can see your pain, young thugs
Stay focused cause we can get this money young thugs
Even though the end of days are comin' (comin')
We can get it right right now do somethin' for somebody
Just hold on for me
I promise there's a better place for all us t-h-u-g's
If he don't believe
Then, don't call yourself a thug, 'cause thugs believe who don't believe, who don't believe

[Hook]
Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Sometimes I sit back and I think, "Why me?" Now how did I become a victim of the struggle
Everyday tryin' to piece this puzzle, and every second I'm out on the hustle
I sit and I guzzle hopin' reality'll pass me by, right on by
And I'm not gonna sit and lie how a my life has been at fine
I could test some reals, alot of determination and skills
Ain'nd the death ain't never come easy not when a nick gotta pay these bills
I scrape this meal feed this man of the house gotta keep that money comin'
Gotta be out here doin' somethin' rather than sittin' back broke with nothin'
Can you feel me?
If I have to come and get ya, I'm a get ya you gon' feel me
And what did they say about little Lay? He's a ghetto legend
Niggas is out here threatened 'cause I'm headed for Armagedon, baby

[Hook]
Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
Back in the day with little Lay
And all the Bones we got to scrappin' for pay
Aometimes I miss when we were kids is all
Now since '95 back when Eazy died of a A-I-D's oh what a
Disease 'n
How many harmony out could it be now everybody wanna
Keep us twisted
You better believe it, little Eazy whispers different
Gotta keep my distance, me paid up on the buildin'
None of us used that just don't stop until I get shot, shot wheelin'
And dealin' me back in the day from the Glock lock, yeah, I see
Greg roll it I seen bad murder, murders St. Claire as for the
Industry we're pickin' now
Sickin' now and the hard-headed came to break it down, lick it out

[Hook]
Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why

Everyday, day, it seems it's gettin' shorter as the world turns
Round and round, these last day, day so crazy, oh why
