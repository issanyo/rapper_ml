[Intro]
Feel the thunder in the sky and the lightning when it strikes
Flash of light, that's your life
There's no way you can escape, no more time to wonder why, no more evil paradise
Fear the light, feel the light and it's way too late to pray
Run away now, run go hide. You can run, you can try to survive
And I doubt it so seriously, you'll stay alive
Now it's over and it's time for our lord O'Jehovah to call in his souljah
Revealin' the revelation and eliminatin' no mo' Gog
And it's no time, no time, no time, no time for repentin'
And it's no time, no time, no time for you to be trippin
Think of the murders, people you murder - people you murdered
So may you rest (rest) in (in) peace

[Repeat 2X]
And it won't be long, it won't be long, it won't be long before
Babylon (Babylon) the Great has fallen (fallen) and the saints go marching in

[Verse 1]
We've been livin' in this world so crazy
And it's got a whole lot more crazier now
Cause now we barely make it, day to day we can't escape it
So the only way to face it altogether is to take it
Frustrated, can't balance your mind, when you feelin' like grabbing that nine
And got to do somethin' drastic to do for the family
Look, I ain't got to tell 'em that there's niggas living that real
Never really did a thing for us and never really sat down and explained to us
That it wouldn't be the same for us, and tryna make a living would be dangerous
Now we sitting on the block just starvin while we watchin' all the big dogs ballin'
We get up and again a thug starts fallin', so we waitin' till our God come callin'
Swing low, swing low, take me away from here -- please know
That we livin' in the last of the last days and when he come and he catch you in your bad ways..

[Hook/Hook]
It's too late to apologize (Too late to apologize)
It's too late (It's way too late to say sorry, too late)
Said, it's too late to apologize (Too late to apologize)
It's too late (It's way too late to say sorry, too late)

[Repeat 2X]
And it won't be long, it won't be long, it won't be long before
Babylon (Babylon) the Great has fallen (fallen) and the saints go marching in

[Verse 2]

Death is right around the corner don't let it creep up on ya
You ended up a goner, murdered right before your eyes
Or you could be down to ride, commit a 187 homicide too late to apologize
Too late to pray to God when the sky start fallin'
Too late to try to interpret the writing on the wall and
It's way too late, to pray, you too late - tribulation too great for you to escape it (escape)
It's the end of the world and still ain't got no satisfaction
Livin' here forever I just can't fathom
Now so you know I appreciate that ransom (that ransom)
And it won't be long, it won't be long, it won't be long before
The world is deceived by the King of the North
He may scream peace but it's really gonna mean war (war)
Government come tumbling down we never need 'em no more (more)
It's way too late to say sorry, too late (too late)

[Hook/Hook]
It's too late to apologize (Too late to apologize)
It's too late (It's way too late to say sorry, too late)
Said, it's too late to apologize (Too late to apologize)
It's too late (It's way too late to say sorry, too late)

[Repeat 2X]
And it won't be long, it won't be long, it won't be long before
Babylon (Babylon) the Great has fallen (fallen) and the saints go marching in
