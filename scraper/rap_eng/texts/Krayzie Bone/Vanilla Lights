[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Look at the trilion unbelievers they can meet you in the sky
Then you get up and go fly and go so high
Nobody can never bring you down
Not even gravity it's all in your mind
So I'mma keep rising up to the top
Stick to the grinders never gonna stop
I'm sick with the rhyming that's all a nigga got
I'm moving against time and time I don't got
Gotta make my mind
And I do it with a fine devotion when I (strategize)
Put the design in motion get it (organized)
Just like I'm blindly focused and a hater can't brake my stride
So the light stay shine as I take flight
Get it early in the morning and then a brake night
Live out my life I can never take light
And all of my wrongs I can never make right
So a nigga just breezing (breezing, breezing, breezing)

[Hook: Ellis One]
I'm free as a dove, my life is a drug
I'm gazing the stars and they don't look very far to me
Now I be the vation for me
Vanilla lights shining bright
Separates my cries
Come take me to the sky
I will do anything I can vision

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Stick to the plan, get next to the man
With the cheques in his hand
Get away from the rest of 'em man
Do the best you can, to keep
Them shady nigga's out of your realm
Never gonna win when the team can't see your dream
Don't wanna be the Indians they wanna be Chief
You wanna make cheese cause you can't spend beef
So lead them niggas in the street (peace)
Get away from me dog, the nigga that vows contagious
Like ya'll niggas got rabies
It amaze me, cause everybody going Krayzie
Sounded like Kray, but they never gonna fade me
I can put that on my momma
I kill em no matter the genre
Niggas gonna honour me, as if I was your father
But I don't even want to be bothered
I'mma keep breezing (breezing, breezing, breezing)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Ain't nobody stopping me from doing what I'm doing
I'mma do it like a ghost and I flow right through 'em
When I flow like fluid and I blow like stupid
And it's all so fluent and I go so tourie
When they get a little bit of this
Well come and get a little fix
And let me put you in the mix
And let me get you niggas hits
So you never do forget
I'm the nigga get you caught up
And then roll up in the twist
And I flip the script
Then I hit 'em like a lyrical storm
For the subliminal poem
It's Kray Jack in the original form
The competition nigga sent to the morgue
And they can all exist no more
I'mma rider (rider, rider)
24\7 the grinder
I'm simply trying to survive, stay alive
And shinning these vanilla lights

[Hook]
