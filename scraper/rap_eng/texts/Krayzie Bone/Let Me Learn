[Chorus]
Let me learn, let me learn, let me learn
Let me learn, let me learn
Let me learn, let me learn, let me learn
Let me learn, let me learn
Just let me live and learn
'Cause I like to earn my life
Just let me live and learn
'Cause I like to earn my life

[Verse 1]
Look, I don't know too much
A lot of people used to tell me that I hope too much
My family they seem to think I drink and smoke too much
They know I'm goin' through it tough but I don't show too much
I'm livin' life and I'm learnin' from all the experience that has been given to me
Now I see how it be really inside of the industry
Friends turned to frenemies, then straight up enemies
Ain't nobody feelin' me, that's how it really be
Lessons I've learned, blessings I've earned, I can clearly see it
And I can feel it, it's real and I live it
To keep it true its really often times
I get confused and kinda lost in the mind
Maintain, tryna stay sane
It's an exhaustin' grind
But I maintain

[Chorus]
Just let me live and learn
'Cause I like to earn my life
Just let me live and learn
'Cause I like to earn my life

[Verse 2]
I just wanna make it to the other side
And scrape along to the other life
Take away the darkness, hardness, feelin' got me nauseous
I remember feelin' when my mother died
You never know, you could be here one day and then the next day you're gone
I gotta get it together, I had to learn
Life lessons, I graduated to a much higher class
Try myself traveling down a much brighter path
Let the sun shine in just a little bit
And let us redefine me on some other shit
See I was sent here for a purpose, for a reason
When God is done with me on Earth, that's when I'm leavin'
So I continue learnin', everythin' concern me
My family, my future, the movement
The tuners, the rulers of it all
So every day I'm alive, I celebrate the hella crazy, I defeated my odds
Ain't it crazy
Jump inside and see my side, it was crazy
If you don't focus you'll go crazy
Head on your shoulders or you go crazy
I've watched them go crazy

[Chorus]
Just let me live and learn
'Cause I like to earn my life
Just let me live and learn
'Cause I like to earn my life
