[Chorus]
Pressure on me
With your love
Nothing weighs me down
Rise above onto our feet
Lemme take your feet off the ground
And lift it up
And lift it up

[Krayzie Bone]
Why you be constantly grabbin' at me
Stabbin' at me like gravity, tryna trap me, snatchin' at me
The Devil is laughing at me, evil happenin, jealousy be the reason, bitches scandalous
Money's another reason niggas savages
They want what I got, I tell them, "Not happening"
And I make sure the haters stay so far from back of me
But they always come after me
Everybody wanna pull a nigga down
They wanna live it when a nigga down
Wait, but chasing this paper, ya'll niggas fake and Krayzie's gon' shake ya, straight out the game
I'm tryna make major, never let a nigga never think they can't fade us
Yes, I can feel your gravity on me cause I get way too high (X10)

[Chorus]
Pressure on me
With your love
Nothing weighs me down
Rise above onto our feet
Lemme take your feet off the ground
And lift it up
And lift it up

[Yelawolf]
Man, life ain't picture perfect
But I'm a damn good photographer
Put glass on a tilted surface half full
Yeah, I was down to crack it, fall down, uh
Lucifer's baby got lose from the stage
I was using my rage as a tool for the slavery
What an illusion, it's crazy
I'm all in cause I'm all out of that cash
Don't pump me up for that disco
I'm kinda pistol for your ass
Momma's boy, raised by the same bitch that flipped bricks in '84
And I took lessons, what I need's pressing
Is an extension not a ploy
Not a game thats soaking in, might have been down and up again
If it ain't nothing I can't get down and down with it then fuck you then
Yelawolf and I got my wings back
Got rid of a couple of things that hit me from flying
Lookin' down at the clouds now

[Chorus]
Pressure on me
With your love
Nothing weighs me down
Rise above onto our feet
Lemme take your feet off the ground
And lift it up
And lift it up

[Bizzy Bone]
I release my gravity
Evermore there the people mad at me
Have it be the motherfuckers of the day it'll be
Where they would be, so scared of me
Creepin' on a come up, to get at those sleepin'
Nigga that gave them the flow in a secret
They like the government, they always invading the privacy, lied to me, already peeped it, peeped it
Cleveland, Cleveland, thuggin' and thievin'
You can believe in one day I'ma get mine, get mine
I'ma break even
I've been lied by them, tired of ridin' with them (???)
So let us step on their neck on my foot
Doin' em' doin' em' get understood
You can be mad at me that's what you took

[Chorus]
Pressure on me
With your love
Nothing weighs me down
Rise above onto our feet
Lemme take your feet off the ground
And lift it up
And lift it up
