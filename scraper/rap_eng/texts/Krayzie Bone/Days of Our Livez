(Bone-Thugs-n-Harmony)
Bone, Bone, Bone
Wasteland soldiers
I been struggling, hustling, thugging it forever
Come and look deeply in my eyes
Come and look deeply in my eyes
Come and look deeply in my eyes
I been struggling, hustling, thugging it forever and ever

Bone
We gotta prepare
We gotta prepare
We gotta prepare
For eternal warfare
For eternal warfare
For eternal warfare


Only time will tell who dies, (Only time will tell)
These are the days of our lives
Come look deeply in my eyes, these are the days of our lives
See the murder mold our lives, (see the murder mold)
These are the days of our lives
These are the days of our lives, these are the days of our lives

[Hook: 2x]
Now come into my world and you can see that we are more than thugs
We more than thugs, more than thugs, more than thugs
With just a little twist of harmony we're smokin' lethal warriors
We warriors, We warriors, we warriors

(Layzie Bone)
Eternally thugs here I come tellin' them soldier stories
Been daily collectin' my lessons, without any questions
Without any questions, stressin' no restin', we journey this blessin'
Shiftin' the game rearranging thangs
Cause once the world was bringin' me down
Mesmerized controlled by the other side, but the devil was in my town
Looking for me

(Wish Bone)
But he won't get me in time, fucking with Bone and he liking these rhymes
We rhyme better believe it all the time, nigga we live
We straight up soldiers, Bet a nigga done told ya, told ya
We rob before we go broke, nigga we robbin' y'all, all of y'all, all y'all

(Krayzie Bone)
Y'all my dawgs if you call or you fall
You can bet on that nigga whenever that I will be there, lean on me
But let us get rid of the enemies. Niggas be sayin "Oh why, why?"
But if you think you can hang, hang, hang

Chorus ( x2 )

(Layzie Bone)
Thuggin' in the studio, y'all know we roll hydro every time we rhyme
I'm high, look at me deeply in my eyes, I rise to the top of the game
No way did I have to run, no way did I have to turn
Sherm, but a lot of these niggas won't learn
But the money that I earn won't burn so come again

(Wish Bone)
Betta watch that Mack 10 nigga this one's for me and my friends
We steadily rollin', I told ya keep bringin' home platinum and gold ones
Pap pap, put it all in the ground, yeah Bone, Yeah we used to get down
(Get down) With the clack back, put it on the ground, now get down

(Bizzy Bone)
Well it must be dawse, hydro, wanna roll my indo
Sittin' all alone on my window, Little Eazy bless his soul, It's so cold
Little Bizzy got stress for the peeps, the streets
And none of these police, ho-lice know me
Still want him cuffed up. Bitch no peace, no peace

Chorus ( x2 )

(Bizzy Bone)
And it ain't no mystery the pistol be and I betta put it under my seat
Little Ripsta scriptures sick styles, reach any or all of my readers
Said it ain't, it baby double me up and get one for my friend
Twenty, twen, twen. We biddin' on bud. Start the bid at a fin
So who want a bag?, Who want a bag?
You want a bag? You want a bag?, You got a bag
Sold! Send em' out of the door to the liquor store for the blunts to roll
Only my Lord can tell who dies
So pick up the puzzle and pieces and put it together of our lives

(Krayzie Bone)
My lordy Lord, maintain, it's hard cause I'm a soldier at war
Cause everbody wanna try to bring out the devil in me
But the evil's embedded in me, weed keeps me at ease
Take notes, oh no cause here it comes
That murda mo comin' to carry you home, you home
Woke up and they see when they pullin' the gauge out, murder
We put it up to your temple and we blow your brains out, die

Chorus ( x4 )
