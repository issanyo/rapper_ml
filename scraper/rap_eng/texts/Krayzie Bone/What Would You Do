(Chorus: Krayzie Bone)
What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?
Tell me... What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?
What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?
Tell me... What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?

(Verse 1: Krayzie Bone)
I fell asleep and had a dream that I fell off in the game
Nigga no more glammer, no more fame no mo bitches or bank
I can't even buy me a 50 sack cuz Im broke
Been tryin ta get me a record deal but they dont love me no mo
Now its serious cuz niggas are befriended me, now everybody my enemy
Could it really be niggas pretendin to be my friends cuz I had the dividends?
As I really did I guess I'm not tha shit now, huh?
I'm tellin ya niggas ya better hope that I dont rebound, uh
I had money, quick fast money, the cash money, I flashed money
But I should'a been smart enough to stash money
Now I'm back on the block Im marchin back to square one
And I got a pocket full'a stones, damn I wish I'd wake up
But I kept dreamin I was slangin rocks, while watchin for cops
And I kept my nine millimeter Glock cocked, case it had ta be shot
I went from makin platnum records ta stugglin back in the ghetto
Chasin paper like I'm crazy, but it ain't nuttin but tha devil
I dont care though, I was willin to risk it all, even my life, (thats right)
I had already lost it all, even my wife. So I'm ready to die
Fuck my girl n fuck the world. If I dont get some cash
Somebody's ass gunnin be deader than a mutha fucka n Im not laughin
I'm used ta livin lavish, havin fancy material
I used ta be a rapper, but shit now I'm a criminal
I'm livin low, feels like I can die right here
This dream really done turned into a nightmare

(Chorus: Krayzie Bone)
What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?
Tell me... What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?
What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?
Tell me... What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?

(Vers 2: Krayzie Bone
Now shit is serious, cuz I gatta get some paper today
I'm thinkin bout runnin up on some bustas, pullin my guage out n spray. (buck buck buck)
Better yet I'm thinkin bout robbin a bank, before ya now it I'm rigth at the safe
With a gun at the back'a the bank tella. Say fella, I'mma need all ya chedda.
LeathaFace down, so they won't get now description
Up in the safe now. If you got some children you'll listen
Look nigga just dont piss me off, cuz I'm already tickin. And can roll with the menace
So chill with the conversation. So come on and pop this combination, now

(Chorus: Krayzie Bone)
What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?
Tell me... What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?
What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?
Tell me... What would you do if they took the fame back from you? took the game back on you? Took the name back?

(Vers 3: Krayzie Bone)
Aww shit, Im back in the mix, he opened the safe
Im finna be rich. I filled that sack with chips
Im thinkin Im bout to dip, this nigga done hit the switch
So, on reflex I shot him. Didn't want to, but I got him
Reight between the eyes. I droped him, as a murder case
Grabbed the money n run out the door
Tha po-po was waitin fa sho
So I did the only thing I know, let off. (shot buck buck buck)
Dipped to the cut, ta the getaway car. Got a pump in the trunk incase I had drama
Im havin drama, they got me trapped in tha back'a tha alley
I'm leving behind the bucket, cocking the pump getting ready to buss' it
Helocopters was hoverin over me, real quick I got ta do somethin
I start runnin, buckin tha guage
Refuse to be stuck in a cage
I'd rather be numb in a grave
Then bein here fucked in the game
To late to save me now LeathaFace comin crazy now
Get out my way cuz the guage is cocked. I spit at you niggas flammin hot slugs
Then they Get up n shoot, lets do this, IÂ´m ready move, got nothin ta lose
Done already lost it, if you was smart you'd back up off me coppers
Aw shit they let off shots n got me dead in the chest
I knew they got me cuz my t-shirt was wet. (pump pump pump,(pump))
I'm bearly breathin, I'm thinkin I'd be dead soon
But I passed out n woke up right back in my bedroom

(Chorus: Krayzie Bone)
