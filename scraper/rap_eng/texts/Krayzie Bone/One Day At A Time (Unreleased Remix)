[Verse 1: 2pac]
Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We continue growing
One day at a time

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]
Take time, it's gonna take time
Ya'll try not to be anxious and bless our way
Take time, it's gonna take time
Take it one day at a time and live longer days
Take time, it's gonna take time
The only way to make it is if we pray
One day at a time

[Verse 2: Outlawz]
No matter how much money you make, Please listen
It ain't no life without struggling kid
Running, ducking a bid
Feeling like there's nothing to live for
We're all diamonds in the eyes of the Lord
They say the good die young on the road to glory
I guess God spared some of us to tell a story
The death of the past is the life of the future
We Outlaw soldiers, the voice of the people

[Verse 3: Outlawz]
Everybody talking bout the game like they can't see the casualties
Living in this world of animosity
And jealously got em after me
Lord don't let em capture me
I'm paranoid and I'm looking for somewhere to go
And I feel like I'm bout to blow
And I don't wanna be broke no mo
I don't wanna be broke no mo

[Verse 4: Outlawz]
You know it takes time to free your body and your mind
Get up on your grind
Change the situation
No sense of crime, cause we're all God's child
Don't lose your mind, gotta have patience
Every day is a test
Every day your breathing you're blessed
Another day to succeed and be the best
For the Prince, Kadafi and Makaveli the Don
We gon keep your name living on
One day at a time
