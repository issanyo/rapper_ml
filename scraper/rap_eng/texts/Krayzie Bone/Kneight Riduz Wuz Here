[Intro]
As the new world order takes us into the year 2000
The shadows of death cast over the sky causin total destruction
As we transform day into night, darkness falls down upon us
We rise from the fog uncomparable to any other form of life
Together we ride by night, unidentified, unseen, unknown
Yes we are the pirates
Our mission is to destroy enemies by any means necessary
And those who interfere with prosecution for execution
Shall indeed be terminated any race be gone
For we are the Kneight Riduz
Killers of the night and first of our kind

[Chorus - 2x]
Can't you feels the temperature droppin gettin cold?
Below zero murda mo go slow flow under your door
Is it magic? not it's murda they don't know that we're pirates
By night we get violent like fighters fightin

[Verse - 1]
You're takin chances runnin around upon me
I got somethin waitin in a cage for you
Wipe that smile off your face when you see us ridin through
Killin 'em all (till everyone fall)
You get out of my way or you're subject to get killed without the clues
I thought people should continues bouncin
A war right now is not what you're really wantin
Pirates got the world on lockdown, we rule from the darkness
We come from beneath the ground, so who wants to party?
We got runnin up with slugs for everybody
Renovate the town in blood with a slaughter
What's the matter? you're not soundin so tough
Am I callin your bluff?
When them high tides come crashin ashes to ashes and dust to dust
We are the pirates, the pirates
Yes we are the pirates, pirates

[Chorus - 2x]

[Verse - 2]
Wanna come fuck with me?
Me bloody matey got me back so check your tick-tock
How many minutes ya got before you drop? been shot
The smell of gun powder fills the air
Bleeding terribly lying there you beg for mercy we don't care
Bloody bodies stacked up in a pile and set the fire
It's the pirates behind all this violence it's not the devil
It's rebellin with my shovel, with my victims lifeless
Tossed over my shoulder as I showed him to his hell-hole
Dead foes to the bottom
Us pirates be heartless my conscious was fuckin with me I shot him and got 'em all believe me
We gonna (??) crazy and i'm silent until I slip into my other mode
We front the underland understand, understand?
We live to die so we fear no man not at all
Everytime we call stay outta the way and outta the dark
And just hope to god, that he'll just come and kill us all
We all gonna dies, it's the ways of life wildest new generation pirates
Us new generation pirates, pirates, us new generation pirates, pirates

[Chorus - 2x]

[Verse - 3]
Up in my temple proceedin i'm waitin to taste your blood run through my veins
And see you gasping out my name
You'll be sayin "psycho bitch, psycho, psycho, psycho"
See (??) is how I kill you
I have to fill my thirst so now I gots to kill you
We are all forgotten souls nightmare of every boy and girl
Kneight Riduh pirates the leaders of the underworld
I'm so happy, happy knowin my torture brought you pain
Play in my little game you hide i'll blow out your brain
Isn't that fun?
Whoever wants some you can hide but you can't run
I cut off your legs now beg, yes beg {laughing}
1-2 Riduz comin for you
3-4 you shoulda locked your door, let me in {laughing}

[Chorus - 2x]
