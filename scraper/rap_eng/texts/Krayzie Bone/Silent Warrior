(Intro) 2x
Pump your fist if you're with me
Pump your fist up if you're with me
Artillery , yeah

Let us be victorious , be victorious

(Skit) 2x
Hut 1 , Hut 2 , Hut 3 , Hut,Hut,Hut,Hut

(Chorus)
Silent warrior here's the story
Silent warrior listen to the story

(Verse 1)
The world war has begun
We're gettin ready to fight
And if you ain't ready to die
Then don't be comin' outside
Spittin fire , fire baby
With plenty ammunition (ammunition)
The missions complete..
And nigga I've been waitin for this
Payback is a bitch
And the bitch is on the period figure
You got niggas with attitude behind the trigger
Steady we be pumpin our fist in
Black fatigues we don't surrender
You wanna deal with us
Gettin ready for split us come and get us
And when you come get us
Remember bitch you gots to kill us
And you can surely believe that I
I'm  bringin all my ammunition with me tonight
Crooked coppers tryin to kill us everywhere
Cause we won't get the mark of the Beast
NO , not me
Stay silent warrior
Silent warrior

(Chorus) 3x
Silent warrior here's the story
Silent warrior listen to the story

(Verse 2)
Nigga get ready for combat
Cause when we aim to bomb back
We usually contact
Heated Heavily buck it steadily
Lay 'em all flat, crawl back
You motherfuckers I repeat: retreat
With plenty heat you'll be defeated
OHHHHH , them bloody murder, murder baby
Silent situation
Is always the perfect assassination
Now to the graveyard nigga where your braveheart, you play hard
Now it's time for me to break march and take charge
We journey to the killing fields
Where the murder and the shit is real
OH Lord, sweet Lord, sweet Lord, sweet Lord, sweet Lord
Comin' forth to carry me home (me home , me home)

(Chorus)
Silent warrior here's the story
Silent warrior listen to the story
