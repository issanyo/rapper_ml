[Verse 1: Benjah]
You know we climbing our way to the top
Feeling like we can't be stopped
Built to the top of the rock
Don't take any credit he bought
Been em' inside of such things
Desire I am to want everything
Enticed by the cleaming
So blessed can't say not a thing
Why's it so hard you to smile, shut up
Complain about all of you life, shut up
Why's it so hard you to smile, shut up
Stop wanting and open your eyes, shut up

[Chorus: Benjah]
Wish you knew we're at the top, climbing
Don't slow down oh don't you stop, climbing
Wish you knew we're at the top, keep dimeing
Don't slow down never don't you stop, we climbing
Wish you knew we're at the top, keep climbing
Don't slow down never don't you stop, we climbing
Wish you knew we're at the top, keep climbing
Don't slow down never don't you stop, we climbing

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Imma get mine mine
Imma get my skrilla
Even if the opposition tryna block me
These haters could never stop me
I glide past haters like I'm sliding on ice, hockey
Its, it's like I'm on a rocket
For tryna run on up me cause I'm undisputed
I say I'm underrated cause they underviewed me
They thought I was an easy target so they pursued me
Movin' on my own, stand alone in my time zone
Running in my mind I'm a no man
And it really don't matter or can I start you bring
It's like a killa goin' slow who I flow fast
Imma never complain cause what you say
And all the hatin in the face only made me lot stronger
Made me last sharper made me last longer
They simply validating that I did what I'm supposed to do
So they gonna ruffle my fathers
What they did do is simply hu hustle get better
Muscle through the struggle don't let up
Even don't fed up even when I'm down on my level (get up)
Sticks and stones could prolly break a bone
But the hate hate spit don't hurt me
20 years later, still show up early
Still ridin' dirty

[Chorus: Benjah]
Wish you knew we're at the top, climbing
Don't slow down oh don't you stop, climbing
Wish you knew we're at the top, keep dimeing
Don't slow down never don't you stop, we climbing
Wish you knew we're at the top, keep climbing
Don't slow down never don't you stop, we climbing
Wish you knew we're at the top, keep climbing
Don't slow down never don't you stop, we climbing

[Verse 3: Benjah]
See all my dreams they waving
Lies in my head captivating
See all my faith just fading
Wolves in the game you praising now
No cure for AIDS more church's ablaze
Remind us that we living in the fallen days
He's been forever in our hearts that's why we want more
Gotta learn to be grateful regardless of the score
Do you hate that Christ now, not Christ something
Deep down he's from the soul the world can't sustain
Live with hope because paradise is coming
Live with hope don't expect this fallen world to be our home
Keeping the eyes of your heart focused
Living life like you know this
This is not our home

[Chorus: Benjah]
Wish you knew we're at the top, climbing
Don't slow down oh don't you stop, climbing
Wish you knew we're at the top, keep dimeing
Don't slow down never don't you stop, we climbing
Wish you knew we're at the top, keep climbing
Don't slow down never don't you stop, we climbing
Wish you knew we're at the top, keep climbing
Don't slow down never don't you stop, we climbing
