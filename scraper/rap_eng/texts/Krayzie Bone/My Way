[DB Bantino]
I tried to leave it all behind if it don't go that way
Then it's back to the work
Yeah I got more on the way
I'm gon' go harder, you know I ain't playing safe
I'm still gon' make my way
If shit don't go my way

I just, hustle, get dough
That's all I really know
Stackin' up everyday
Yeah bring that cash my way
(X2)

[Bizzy Bone]
I'm finna get it done
You leave no message
Bitch niggas want me to lead them
I'm just a legend
When I play nintendo
Milli rock clock, clock
Put in they stomach
The niggas eatin'
Smith and the Wessin
A .38 snub and another weapon
And a dirty motherfucker with a brother fetish
L-Burna, I'm a real nigga
Leathaface, I'm a stern nigga
Wish, Flesh, straight like a perm nigga
A nigga mindin' my business
I'm bout servin'
That ain't nothing but the red button
Had a meeting with a dead puppet
That they get the bad hand, book it cause I'm to their visual, there's somethin' coming, I'ma get it on
And leave a motherfucker runnin'
I'ma leave alone, until I see the motherfucker
Who they creepin' on?
Who you motherfuckers sleeping on?
Who they motherfuck think I creeped on?

I been really thinkin' different to the niggas that they claim that they running the game
I'm looking at them like they lame, they all in the same
I give a fuck about your fame, don't come in my lane
Cause I'ma lyrically kill em', and put one in your brain
I'm the nigga that created it, even today
These other niggas imitated it, even the braids
Now that shit Kray
So you better put a little respect on my naaaame
I guess they thinkin' since a nigga that forty somthin'
That I wanna load that on em', but I guess I gotta proven you a lie
Grand daddy swagger
Ready for battle, no man better, never no tongue badder
Have a never (?) cause anybody can lose it
I'm the nigga that proved it, a nigga that can do it
And we gon' keep it real like that for 'Pac!
To me, all competition dry, they suck
