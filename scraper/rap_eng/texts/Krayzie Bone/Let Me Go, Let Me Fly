[Intro]
Let me go
Just let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I can't eat, I can't think, I can't sleep
And I really can't believe I'm tweakin, cuz this ain't me
She givin me a reason I should lead the way, she
Keep feelin how she really not about to play me
Ya better go and ask somebody 'bout K-B
Cause when it comes to swag I got, certainly not - these
Playa haters, major fakers
Crazed in captive, but he not gon' save us
Well let me tell ya what I can do for you (And you)
I can drop ya off and say bye-bye baby (Baby)
And I think that she was thinkin maybe
She could get with Krayzay
And this would be her major pay-day (Day-day-Hey)
But I'm not the one, we ain't the two, cause this ain't for me
I figure we should go our seperate ways and split
So I'm askin you this with the utmost respect (Respect-respect)

[Hook]
Let me go (Go)
Just let me go (Go, go)
Let me go, let me fly, let me glow (Glow-glow)
Let me go (Go)
Just let me go (Go, go)
Let me go, let me fly, let me glow (Glow-glow)

[Verse 2]
Man for fifteen years, I've been workin (Workin)
I still can't seem to meet these 'ends, this ain't workin (Workin)
I'm hurtin while everybody keep eatin off mine (Eatin off mine)
I'm really not certain it's even worth my time
Makin music is supposed to make ya feel good
But all the politics is more a burden
It's what'cha never see behind the curtain
Make it executive, just like politicians, talk of the game
But when ya select 'em and elect 'em, you become slaves
They try do dictate my days, they don't pay
It's crazy that the paper don't weigh like my fame
They really must think I'm slow, but I know they all snakes
I can't take it anymore, let me go to fly free
I bet I can do better than you never thought you'd ever see
Krayzie get that upper-hand, snap back like a rubber band
I figure we should go our seperate ways and split
So I'm askin you this with the utmost respect (Respect-respect)

[Hook]
Let me go (Go)
Just let me go (Go, go)
Let me go, let me fly, let me glow (Glow-glow)
Let me go (Go)
Just let me go (Go, go)
Let me go, let me fly, let me glow (Glow-glow)

[Interlude]
Them dollar bills yo
Them dollar bills y'all
Don't underestimate the weight of dollar bills y'all
Them dollar bills y'all
I'll probably kill y'all
Prolly be dying for the mighty dollar bill y'all (Bill y'all)

[Verse 3]
Let me go, let me fly
Let me glow, I wanna be free
Befriend no foe
Cause I don't need no fake niggas smilin in my face
So leave me alooooone
Cause it ain't too much to talk about-
If you ain't conversatin' bout cash
So leave me alone
So don't get mad when I ride through and beat-
But I keep ridin past (Ridin past-ridin past-ridin past)
Cause see I really never sleep, in fatigue-
Got the heat in the stash (In the stash-in the stash-in the stash)
The haters, they don't wanna see you last
Yup, that's just what momma used to say
+That one day this was gonna happen, but she never told me when+ (So craaazyy)
She also told me money and fame ain't everythang
So don't love it cause it ain't ya friend

[Hook]
Let me go (Go)
Just let me go (Go, go)
Let me go, let me fly, let me glow (Glow-glow)
Let me go (Go)
Just let me go (Go, go)
Let me go, let me fly, let me glow (Glow-glow)
