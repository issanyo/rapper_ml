[Vocals: Krayzie Bone]
Woke up this morning glanced outside my bedroom window, I could see
My life so clearly in this place I'm not supposed to be
I can see the light now
Kinda dim really ain't that bright now
Need to get away right now
If I want to survive
Doing it now
Is the right time
I gotta try to save me
Anything I gotta do I gotta do it to protect my soul
The rich and the famous dreams I had now i’m feelin like it's time that I let them go
The times are changing
Now my mind realize all this evil won't let me grow
I could really see it i really believe it
But will I break free?
I don't know (I can see it clear now, clear now)
I don't know (it’s ever so clear now, clear now)
It's so hard to let go (I can see it clear now, clear now)
I don't know, know (it’s ever so clear now, clear now)
It's hard to let go, go, go... (fade away)

[Rap Verse: Krayzie Bone]
As I look into my life I see clearer now than before
And I realize even more
I can see the light through the force
It's been guiding me through my cause
Reminding me of my boys
That's lying up in the morgue
That I am one with the lord
Some fall asleep counting sheep
I fall asleep counting blessings
I hang around with them niggas
That hardly seem to be stressing
With all their worldly possessions
They dismissive obsessions
They simply missing the message
They thinking they going to heaven
Now they guessing
Will it end in twenty twelve? is the question
The pressure
Of ending up in hell
Is it pressing
I'm waiting on the day where everyboddy would just recognize
But then I realize
I'm waiting for never, waiting for never
I'm waiting for never, waiting for never
I'm waiting for never, waiting for never
I'm waiting for never, waiting for never
I'm waiting for never, waiting for never
I'm waiting for never, waiting for never... (fade away)
