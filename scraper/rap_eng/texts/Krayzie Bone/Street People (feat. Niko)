Dedicate this to all the niggas on the streets; niggas in the hood strugglin'
Doin' what the fuck they gotta do to make their money; and all the thugs, the
Hustlas, the gangstas, the playas, pimps. Let's roll, let's roll
[. . . ghetto love, ghetto love. I can feel that ghetto love, ghetto love . . .]

Street people [people] All my people be them niggas with an attitude. [We're
Ready for war.] The street mentality: it's do what you gotta do [do what you
Gotta do]

I dedicate this to the niggas in the hood [Where they at? Where they at? Where
They at?], keepin' it real on the street. Niggas they practice what they preach
Stayin' true until they D-I-E. Niggas still strong. We keep on bailin' through
The stress and all the rest of the shit that's goin' on. Speakin' of violence, I
See, you got to keep a pistol, 'cause if niggas think you're rich, you gon' be
Got, they out to pinch ya. Bullshit you not--killin' because of the pump, and it
Drives us to the point of no return, especially when you 're gone off of the
Sherm. You could give a fuck about a nigga flossin'. While you walkin', he on
Sixteen switches. Ain't that a bitch? But that's life. This shit ain't nothin'
Nice, and he'll take yours if his ain't right. And I can't stop 'em or knock
'em, but yo, I wouldn't even try, though. 'Cause Bible say, "Hey, either repent
Or you will die." So [so, so], choose one [just one]: either repent and get
Saved, or put some food on your table for now

But that's the brakes, rustle up what you can. Gotta feed your babies [babies
Yeah]. Handle yourself your own business--don't wait on that nigga to get you
Nothin'. We been poor long enough, and I know you would scheme on somethin'
[somethin', yeah]. Take the welfare, fuck it! The system givin' it to you
'cause it's guilt on they conscience. Don't let 'em fool you [don't let 'em fool
You, no]. Really ain't doin' a nigga any favors, so come on and get the paper
Paper, before you die, die. This verse is for my ghetto queens, tryin' to come
Up and get them better things, particularly cheddar cheese. Make that money
[Make that money]. Work, work, work. Whatever your occupation, as long as you
Bringin' home the bacon, bacon, bacon. Don't let your enemy lock your mind, too
And I hope y'all really been payin' attention 'cause it's 1999, ooh. [Ooh-ooh
Yeah.] Though people comin' around, we gon' thug. So where the thugs at? Gimme
Some of that ghetto love [ghettp love]

The muthafuckas! I'm serious and mean business. Ready to pump pump and ride, you
With it? Come on, put it out there. Pump, pump, pump police. They treat us like
Animals--let's attack 'em like beasts. But hold on: 'fore you start fightin'
[hold on, hold on], let's brighten up the action scene, pass me the gasoline [no
More, no more]. I'm really not trippin' on this rappin' no more, 'cause I know
It won't last too much longer . When it's over, then I be a full-time soldier [I
Told you], if I make it out of the game with all my sanity. Get paid, fuck the
Fame, get out quickly. Understand me? 'Cause at the rate I'm goin', pretty soon
They'll try to ban me for killin' these muthafuckas tryin' to tamper with my
Family. Now they got me runnin' from these po-po's, tryin' to jam me, but I told
Them muthafuckas not to try to test my manly, and this is my mentality for
Fuckin' with the street life, street life [street life.]

Alive, some people out there smokin' crack. My people workin' 9 to 5, just doin'
It right. Real strong, hold on 'cause it won't be long before the strugglin'
Days is long gone, hold on, be strong
