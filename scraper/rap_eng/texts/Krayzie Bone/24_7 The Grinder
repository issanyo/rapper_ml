[Intro: Krayzie bone]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know what I'mma call this one
24/7 the grinder, the grinder, the grinder (let's go)
Kray jack ya boss
24/7 the grinder, the grinder, the grinder
U know what I'm sayin? y'all gonna feel me on this one
24/7 the grinder, the grinder, the grinder
I'm always on the grind man, never sleep, hardly eat, for real
24/7 the grinder

[Verse 1: krayzie bone]
9 to 5 won't slow down til my money right
I'm tryna live a little with the sunny bright lights
And I admit a nigga loving quite nice
I'm addicted to living at a high price
So I'm tempted to risk it with my life
I'm straight through the day but then by night
I'm on the grind and my mind in the twilight
I go the hardest, comin' like a snarling bull when I'm charging
I'm come through like a street sweeper on these weak niggas game full of garbage
What did they accomplish? they can't do what I did
Somebody tell'em who I is, the wicked lyric professor
Soon to be back on the stretcher, its dead on arrival
The suspect is my flow
And its armed and its dangerous
And kind of hard to apprehend this
How raw my pen is, my harmonies a silent killer
Serial spitter, lyrical nigga
Figure they can sleep on me all they want
But when they awake and they see I was real
And leathaface still in the building
The swag is classic, kray jack's the baddest
Still on the block, I've done weighed two rocks
This product I got they can't wait to cop
Competitors they can't fade me now
If you don't got dope that krayzie got
Took over the spot now make it hot
Don't think I got soft cause the gauge is cocked
So hit some of this and go tell everybody I'm back
And the nigga is blazzing hot

[Hook]
If you got the dough I got the dope
Hit me up I got whatchu you need
If you tryna blow I got the dro
Hit me up I got whatchu need
If you got the dough I got the dope
Hit me up I got whatchu you need
If you tryna blow I got the dro
Hit me up I got whatchu need
Show your right
24/7 grinder
I'm always on my grind, on my grind, on my grind, on my grind
24/7 grinder
I'm always on my grind, on my grind, on my grind, grind, grind

[Verse 2: krayzie bone]
Everybody wanna get a brick of the good dope
So pure, so potent, so cold
Injection, make a nigga feel a little better
The popo still wanna know what I'm sellin'
So I tell em its daily medicine
All you need is a dose
And off you go
Into a zone you have never been
You can call it melodic marijuana
I call it heroin harmony
From Mr. dope man got the fiends still callin me
Every nigt, cause I'm 24/7 the grinder
I advertise, I gotta remind 'em
If you lookin for something a lil stronger
Then you know where to find us
Just follow your nose, nose, nose
It always know, know, know
You smell the dro inhale the blow, go tell some mo, mo, mo
We got some flotion potion thats gone fold you open up
We keep our smokin signal floatin in the air
So you know its us

[Hook]
If you got the dough I got the dope
Hit me up I got whatchu you need
If you tryna blow I got the dro
Hit me up I got whatchu need
If you got the dough I got the dope
Hit me up I got whatchu you need
If you tryna blow I got the dro
Hit me up I got whatchu need
Show your right
Yeah(yeah), yeah hustler, hustler(4X)

[Outro: krayzie bone]
I never sleep, (never sleep) I barely eat (barely eat)
I be so deep within' my thoughts it's pain to think (pain to think)
I won't rest(rest, rest), I don't stretch (stretch, stretch))
But maybe that's why I've got this sharp pain in my chair

See me on my grind(grind, grind)
Catch me on my grind(grind, grind)
