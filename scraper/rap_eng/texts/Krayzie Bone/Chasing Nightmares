Night mares of the night(X2)
I had a dream so I chased it
Nobody never told Me I would be lost in the matrix
Come on and live the life
Is the way that they portrayed it
Painted a pretty picture but the pretty picture faded, I hated it
And the game showed me the shadiness when I realize that my favorite rapper was fakin it
They had me thinking it was all about that gangsta shit
Now I'm seeing that them niggas really ain't the shit
You pay a high price trying to live that high life
Cashing your souls start lacking control
When the money get to flowing in
Hard to know who foe or friend
Everybody lookin kinda strange at me
Why so many haters taking aim at me
I figured since a nigga made a change they'd be happy
Make a better livin for the family, ya feel me?
You mean to tell me just cause I made it they wanna kill me?
What sort of life is this we supposed to live?
What in the hell have I been telling these kids, Get your money, Live it up, spend it up cause you only live once, but that's kind of a lie ya'll
See, this dream of mine put me to sleep but real life started leaving me behind, put a lot of time
You can dream if you wanna dream, but learn a lesson from me and just don't fall asleep
I dream, dream that I could make it at the top of the mountain and I would be king, king
But when I woke up in the middle of my dream late night I scream, scream
And you really won't believe me if I tell you everything I've seen, seen
I realize I wasn't even chasing a dream
I chased a nightmare
I had a dream I pursued it
Nobody told that doing this would be foolish
That it would detour my decisions have me thinking stupid
I could have sacrificed my friends and my family, I'm useless I'm losing it
I never knew what I was doing
I underestimated the world of satans influence
I figured I can get in and out of it nothing to it
Just tryna get what I can get out of it and keep moving, but I blew it
I had a very close encounter with the devil
And he showed me all theses elevated levels of myself
Took me to the highest mountain and I pedestal myself
Didn't realize he had planted a rebel in myself
I'm like, woah, have I been sinnin all this time? Chasing the Devil, living a lie? Oh my god. Fool, fool
Thinkin I'm leader but I really was a tool, tool
To figure out the truth, a nigga had to go to school
So I'm flipping through the scriptures and looking at the news, and the news paint the picture that the scriptures are true
So now I'm fighting and tryna wake up, runnin, but I'm movin in slow motion, hopeless
If, if, if I wasn't so gone off the Hennessy and weed then I prolly wouldn't be in a deep sleep
Spiritually drowsy, seriously cloudy, I gotta get some good up and get fearless about me
Promised to God if I make it out of this nightmare Alive, I'll be a soldier for the rest of my life
And I don't wanna be involved with the chaos, the women, money, fame, all them things I can lay off, and leave em alone
If I got no more momentum, I don't need them no more, I'm not competing no more, wake up, wake up
I dream, dream that I could make it to the top of the mountain and I would be king, king
But when I woke up in the middle of my dream late night I scream, scream
And you really won't believe me if I tell you everything I've seen, seen
I realize I wasn't even chasing a dream
I chased a nightmare
(You can dream of you wanna dream)
But a learn a lesson from me and just don't fall asleep
(You can, you can dream if you wanna dream)
I chased a nightmare
(You can, you can dream if you wanna dream)
Nightmare
I chased a nightmare
