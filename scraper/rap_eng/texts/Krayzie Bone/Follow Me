[Young Noble]
I am not the type of nigga to play no games
You was good as gone
You caught up in my aim
We do this for practice
You fucking with masters
Of our craft see this style
My nigga I own this
In my own lane not keeping up
With the Jones's
Ain't nobody gave me shit
Lil nigga I earn't this
Erytime I'm in the booth
My nigga I burn shit
Gotta stay up on them toes
Then Tables they turn quick
All the crime I be doing
I'm surely gon die rich
All I do is keep it moving
The sure is the time tick
All this music to this point
They label it timeless
Come walk tall through the storm
My credit is spotless

[Chorus: Young Noble]
Take a look around tell me what you see
Momma raised a man
The streets raised a G
New thug brother shit
Nigga follow me
Outlawz, Bone Thugs
You know who we be
C'mon

[Krayzie Bone]
There ain't no other that can get it how I get it, independent with it, still the realest, still no competition in it
So if you think about contending you should think a minute cause you dealing with some authentic niggas that truly venting
Lyrical menace critical to the finish
So here we go to the finish
Let's see if niggas really on their defense
Thug nation, I pledge allegiance to my legion of thugs, we give a fuck, quick to fuck a nigga up, ah!
That nigga Krayzie gotta spit at em' in style
Like get at em sound
And you don't wanna get caught in the middle of it
My thug brother Nobel holding me down
Bust off a couple of rounds
Suckas be hatin but a nigga love it
I'm still running with the AK 47 busting niggas in the belly, you mother fuckers ain't ready for this
I shoot the rugar, turn niggas into manure
Maneuver ya to the sewer
Persuader I hit ya deadly as shit you done
Don't make me introduce you to the clip and gun
It's not a pistol, oh no it's just a tongue
It's official now, the killing has just begun, has just begun
A real nigga from the "G" age
Y'all chumps better behave
Cause if I gotta pop the trunk
Then i'ma cock the pump
And tell the cops come mop you up, they go mop you up

[Chorus]
Take a look around tell me what you see
Momma raised a man
The streets raised a G
New thug brother shit
Nigga follow me
Outlawz, Bone Thugs
You know who we be
C'mon
(X2)

Take a look around tell me what you see
Peeping the whole scene
Whatevers going on around me (Hail Mary)
Brain cloudy, I told you niggas never doubt me
Ten toes, Young No, Outlawz

Take a look around tell me what you see
Momma raised a man
The streets raised a G
New thug brother shit
Nigga follow me
Outlawz, Bone Thugs
You know who we be
C'mon
