It was too late to be concerned
So the story goes you live and you learn
Well, Well, Well


Ooohhhhhhh, Well, Well, Well x2


[Krayzie Bone:]
Yeah, yeah!
What I'm gonna do is get into some real shit right about now
Story of my life

Grew up in the ghettos of Cleveland man
And I've seen so many crazy things you wouldn't believe me man
I been there
Seventeen, I'm out on my own trying to be grown
I was just trying keep from falling up on the d-low
Niggas started from zero
Doing it the way that we know
(?) niggas with c-notes
Selling them counterfeit dope
I did it to make a living even though I was sinning
That's why today I bow down ask the lord for forgiveness
But I was hustling, struggling man cause it was hard
Gotta do something cause nothing ain't gone help at all
I want it better but it ain't
I wanna change my ways but I can't

[Hook:]
It was too late (much too late)
To be concerned (too even ever be concerned)
So the story goes you live and you learn
Well well well
It was too late (much too late)
To be concerned (too even ever be concerned)
So the story goes you live and you learn
Well well well

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
With no sense of direction I'm headed down to the justice center
I think it was 6 in the morning bounty rushed me nigga
When they cuffed me nigga
They tried to scuff me nigga
But couldn't budge a nigga
Cause I'm a thugster nigga, ya hear me?
But I'm in the cell now, I bail around
And jail-bound, steady pacing and awaiting my so-called fair trail
A couple a months done passed me up a nigga still sitting
I'm stuck in the system and the judge still tripping, listen
Looking at these steel walls, driving me nuts
That's why I jump up every time they shut
I guess I ain't so tough
Wish it was better but it ain't
I wanna change now but I can't

[Hook]

[Outro]
It's too late for me to be concerned now
All a nigga can do is live and learn now
That's the only way to save yourself from the drama that you gave yourself
Well well!
Some of my niggas out there still living wrong
Some of them niggas don't intend on living long
Some of them niggas gonna get killed to learn
Then it's too late to be concerned
That's why ya
Live and, ya live and learn
Live and, ya live and learn
Live and, ya live and learn
Live and, ya live and learn

[Hook]
