(Raj Stacks Hook)

Got a lot of enemies round here

They just wanna see me bleed round here

I done brung em to they kneees round here

They don't wanna fuck with meee round here

Fuck what you saying Ima pull right now

Fully tinted windows, Ima pull right now

Hating on the boy, Ima pull right now

Say another word, Ima pull right now



(Raj Stacks Verse)

Ugh, I use to trip when they use to say they hate me

Like nintendos wanna play me, now all congratulate me

I just bought my own Mercedes, now these bitches wanna rape me

Cuz a young playa getting Cash money like baby


Muthafuck em, I just fuck then I duck em, I don't love em

They use brush me off when I never had nothing

Now I'm mad stunting, poppin bottles on the top flo

Pull up the intersection, where the fuck my top go?


Pull on your favorite artist, he know that my flow retarded

He don't wanna get me started, he just rap about his foriegn

That he leased, he thief, he got freaks in sheets

But that shit is only his raps


Those chains that he wearing? He gotta give em back

Those cars that he driving? He gotta give em back

Man, How he authentic when even his teeth fake?

Bitch it's young raj stacks, my only competition Drake, ahh

Hook 2

(Mistah Fab Verse)

I'm so dope lyrically, I could charge 10 a key

Feeling like a young buck but never been to Tennessee

Everybody say they tight but I don't hear no remedy

These Niggas only tight when they get drunk off some Hennesey

Physically ain't touching me, you bad bitch she sucking me, rap game is stuck with me

Niggas say shoot, ok shoot so I shot em, so now that nother nigga drop okay now he don't want no problems

Cuz I get em, get em, got em, pop em, this is how I drop em
And you don't want no problems, Mistah Fab is not an option

Look, been the shit since '94, I don't think now I don't know

Serve this shit right down the coast so that mean I'm the next to blow

Next to go to texaco, flow from here to mexico, everybody be like damn his necklace glow, his necklace gross

Got some bitches? Well bruh bruh, quit playing, text them hoes
And if some niggas want some problems then okay the tecs will blow!

(Hook 3)


(Krayzie Bone Verse)
I rumble like I'm thunder, and I kinda make em wonder

Is their favorite motherfuckas really suckas undercover?

I'm one of the baddest niggas, grandaddy the grandest nigga

You niggas generic, but I'm already branded nigga

They never saw nothing like me because I'm a different kind of beast
So unique they say that niggas a lyrical freak

Its a miracle me with historical swag, we like mystikal we unpredictable man

Tell em been on the down low because I've been tryna get my grind up

But I'm back with a vengance, nigga ya times up

I ain't on one, I am one so all you niggas respect your elders cuz all you niggas my grandson

Unprotected sex with the game, so I birth bastards

I see the resemblance and I hear it, you niggas trash bruh

You gotta little swagger because you seemed to study the master

But next time you gotta bring your best rhymes to see the thrasher
