[Felecia]
From Monday to Friday, your schedule's so demanding
Hardly have any time to breathe, maybe even forget to eat
This is just how +Bizzy+, your life in this +Krayzie+
Don't you +Wish+ you can be +Layzie+
Well relax your +Flesh+, do your damn thing baby

[Chorus: Felecia]
Everybody, feel the flow and do your thang
We're havin a good time, everything's gonna be okay (be okay)
Everybody, feel the flow and do your thang (do your thang)
We're havin a good time, everything's gonna be okay

[Layzie Bone]
I can tell you feel the pressure
I can see it written all over your face and
Need a vacation, from your situation
Just let your hair down, do what you want to
Kick it in a place, where everybody knows your name
Let your heart be free
And everybody know how hard life can be
And just as long as you're breathin baby
It don't matter what you're doin you can get it baby, so gon' and maintain
Main thang is survive the game
You gotta get up on your feet and just do your thang
Wipe the tears from your eyes, know you gon' ride
You can't make it if you don't try, give up and you gon' die
It's only life you got to love it or leave it
Here today and gone tomorrow man you better believe it
Time is tickin so don't play wit it
And you if you ask me how I'm knowin Little Lay' did it

[Krayzie Bone]
Back up and let me do my thang
I +Got Up & Got It+ and did it like the song say
If you think I'ma slouch in the game y'all don't know Kray'
24/7 I'm on the grind
And ain't no more stressin, I'm tryna rise to the good life
Had to shake a lot of bustas now I'm sucka-free
Thuggish Ruggish 'til the day the Lord come for me
So watch out now! Them niggas on the roll
Collectin mo' triple-O, mo' triple-O zeroes (zeroes, zeroes)

[Chorus]

[Felecia]
Be okayyy - some situations carry too much, weight (weight)
And I know it seems like, it's too much to, take (take)
So when you get burdened, know life ain't perfect
Just relax yourself, do the damn thing baby

[Chorus]

[Felecia]
Be okayyy - we're havin a good time, everything's gonna be okay
Be okayyy - we're havin a good time, we're havin a good time
We're havin a good time, leave your cares all behind
We're havin a good time, we're havin a good time

[Chorus] - repeat 2X w/ ad libs

[Felecia]
Everything's gonna be okay, okay
Everything's gonna be, okay
Everything's gonna be, okay (everything's gonna be okay)
Everything's gonna be, okay
Everything's gonna be, okay
Everything's gonna be okay
Everything's gonna be, okay
