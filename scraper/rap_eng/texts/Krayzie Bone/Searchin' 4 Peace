[Boogy Nikke]
Jesus, can you help us clean our soul
Because we're searchin' for peace, searchin' for peace?

[Tony Tone]
Dear Lord, can you help me (help me, help me)?

[Boogy Nikke] (Mo! Hart)
God, grant serenity for all the sin that's entered me
Keep me from hurt, harm, and danger, and be a friend to me
(The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want
He makes me lie down in green pastures
He lays me beside the still waters.)

[Boogy Nikke]
I testified against those lies
Because I'm searchin' for peace
I humble my heart and cleanse my soul
And ask the Lord, "Can I roll?"
I wanna be makin' it to these
Places with my people, Mo Thug
Those playa haters need stop playin'
And get to prayin'
Dear Lord, before You blow Your horn
And open up Your door like Matthew's verse
You said You comin', in the scripture
Better be ready, boy
I'm ready to make a change within in myself
And bow down to the playa haters
Shady ladies drivin' me crazy
But I don't stress about the bullshit
That they talkin' about
I drop to my knees
And give up peace to the Lord open up Your door
And let Your People know
What time it is gonna shine again
Your heart be fillin' with laughter
The joy has passed us
You got those angels flyin' around
You ? the ground
You got them horns blowin',? nobody's knowin'
But it's peace

(Chorus)

[Mo! Hart]
Confusion and hostility bombards me everyday
I often pray to God to please show me a better way
Struggles are much harder, the man's getting smarter
It's getting so hard, can't even make an honest dollar
Mom was on welfare, Pop's a freakin' lunatic
I'm just a young brother who's trapped in the wrong pit
Just like my man Daniel
I can stand the test of time
But my mind does tend to wander away at times
But all the while, I stay strong and I keep my faith
Try not to flip out when I got two hungry lions in my face
Steady schemin' to come up off me
Please Lord, help me
Deliver me from this agony

(Chorus)

[Tony Tone]
Keepin wisdom in my life
But there's evil in my sights
So I pray to the Lord to bless my soul and take control
I know it's almost time to go, racin' to death
Your word is kept
Now Jesus wept, but I can not slip
And take a trip and end this bitch
Surrounded by hate, it makes me sick
Searchin' for peace, and I'm on my knees
God, help me maintain
In Jesus name, I don't want these sins within
I'll burn in flames, gotta make change
One life to live and I give my all to You
But demons schemin', thinkin' a nigga's slippin'
It got me trippin'
Take this proposition and listen
Just stay on my mission
And lose if feud in my mentals, polluting my temple
Remember, there's life after death
Keep good health, might as well
Don't play yourself
Some time is left
Be at peace with yourself
Be at peace

(Chorus)
