[Hook x2]
Gemini, everytime I try to use my mind
Seems like I gotta fight two sides
And I never know which one's right
That's my life

[Krayzie Bone]
Man since I been off in this music business shit has gotten crazy
I gotta be dealing wit devils bitches and bustas daily
All ah dem was screamin to take me on that long ride
Journey or mission, whatever you wanna call it
They tryin to get me Listen
I'm hearing voices screaming Kill dem muthaphukkaz dead
Other voices saying be humble man and understand
I try to be level headed but it seems the devils winnin
Try to do the right thing but I always end up sinnin
Pin Me
God won't forgive you when you pray and do the same shit
So I repent, and you can't even pay yo rent
If it ain't no dollars ain't no sense right now
But as I stop and think, a nigga got kids right now
And mine got ta eat
But they can't eat if daddy's dead or in jail
So, what would you do choose heaven or hell
If it's hell, you'd probly come up fast, and die
That's why {and i} I wonder why heaven
Ain't the chance on my mind

[Deep voice Krayzie]
Listen nigga, you plan on having thought of thangs
Then fuck everybody else, think about yo self
Them muthaphukkaz never gave you shit
Fuck that nigga take that bitch
You smoke all the muthaphukkin reefa you give
Kill any muthaphukka you feel need to be killed
And the niggas that used to run wit cha
They ain't cha friends them niggas is out ta get cha
And fuck this Ruthless bitch
Them muthaphukkaz ain't paid you for shit
If I was you and you was me
Then i'll bust in that office and take my profits
But nah, you muthaphukkaz tryin ta go to heaven
Be broke and ain't nobody bless you
What happen to the muthaphukkin nigga I know
The nigga that was lokking the let the guns smoke
You a mastermind you need to say fuck this rap shit
And put it in some crime {sometimes}
You money waitin nigga
Ya muthaphukkin money ways niggas
Don't let chu know you gotta fight these niggas]
You know you got damn right
Handle my pistol dawg cuz I den got hype
Finna be some muthaphukkaz dying tonight
The shit ain't right
Cuz I den stayed humble and kept it real wit chu hoes
[And muthaphukkaz try to play me still nigga I know]
Yeah muthaphukkaz is thinkin a nigga got soft
And I dropped my sawed off and I won't break em off
But chu know a nigga [show dem niggas]
Ho ass niggas [told dem niggas]
If I had to fake that is was on
(Stop hold up nigga wait don't go makin a mistake wit cho life)
[Man fuck this ho shit niggas is bout ta ride]
But wait, what chu mean make a mistake

(But killing ain't the way ta get it please hear me)
Well how the fuck I'm pose to eat
[Ain't no other way] (but it is)
[It ain't fuck that] How you feel it is [Oh shit]
(You got ta pray, they'll be a better day
I can bet there'll be a better way
But chu gotta keep ya faith don't let them demons take
Ya soul don't sell ya soul no
Remember what chu reap ya so, and if you try ta cheat he know)
[Fuck that save the world shit
Don't listen to that garbage
Don't chu know niggas gone die hell regardless
Don't chu got a family nigga what about cho daughter]
(And that's just the reason you should trust in the
Lordy Lordy Lordy Lord)
So what am I to do, go dance with the devil
Or be true ta you know who get paid I make due
But the bad is lookin good
And the good is lookin bad
Shit you be the judge of that dat
