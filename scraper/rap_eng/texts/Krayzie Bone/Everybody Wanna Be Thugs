[Hook x2]
Everybody wanna be thugs
They really don't cause if they lived my life they'd understand
Niggas for they self, no love
And it ain't nothin better than a gun in hand

[Verse 1: Krayzie]
I'm lookin at all my niggas on the corner still trying to come up on something
Like some paper, cash money
Two-double-o-zero, niggas is desperate to make it
Battlin Satan, but the plate that he made us looks so tasty
Temptation over took my devils persuasion
Makin me chase the paper while trying to break 'em, I blaze 'em
Then I raise up, nigga that's the way thugs do it
See it don't say nothin just to find out we kinda stupid
In the streets we play for keeps
Niggas ain't comin back for revenge or whatever, loc
We havin none of that, so scandalous
You better keep your protection
Cause the grass and the blunts ain't the only thing we wet up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krayzie]
See, I've been runnin from the po-po ever since I was 11
Nigga bellin, ain't tryin to get kept and slept in the cell, man
A lot like my daddy, but then again I'm like myself
Keep my nose in my business and worry about nobody else
Got a mind of my own aside from Bone
So nigga don't think that you can run up and test me when I'm alone
Cause I got the chrome
Talk mo' shit I'm still a street thug, but I make mo' hits (mo' hits)
Platinum packin magnum never leave the house without it
And if he bout it don't sing about it nigga bring up out that shit
Thugline, frontline
Nigga it ain't scared, we done time
Leatherface is on the rampage, murder mangler, strangler
What you came with it just ain't enough
To tame the thug, we aim to drain the blood from your skull
Rappin but we dangerous, dangerous

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Krayzie]
Now to my youngsters with they guns
Out on the corner perfomin tryna to be soldiers
Just remember that I told ya, slow down, down, down
I know you wanna be a thug, and do what we done
But if it ain't inside your blood then this ain't the game that you tryin to
Play
Just like one of my niggas tried to hang, and he died in a day
Awww, shame, shame, shame
Bullet hit him in the brain
And he was a thug nigga, you get the picture?
Picture niggas in a single file line
All crying, upset because their niggas died, nobody know why
It's so many dying cause too many trying to shine
We all trying to swang on the same godamned vine
It's about that time for the thugs to unite
And let this motherfucka burn tonight (tonight, night)
If you a thug get up and join this thug nation (thug nation)
We got guns waitin (guns waitin)
Soon as the enemy run up, blaze 'em (blaze 'em)
