[Intro:]
Yeah, what’s up, nigga?
These niggas must have forgotten, man
We’re the niggas started this shit!
Now I’m for real!
Fucked up, niggas, fuck!

Krayzie Jackson swagg classic
Grand daddy swagger
Everybody wanna ride my wagon
Swagging, evertime I pull my lac up
Fifty million I've sold
Imagine how that stack up
But I’ve never been one to brag
About my financial status
All these rappers claiming, they’re bad
But they sound the same, they’re all average
And everybody trying to bite the master
Find ‘em all hard to swallow like cactus
Tell ‘em I'm hard to follow like Jackson
Mike to be exactly
Ya’ll need to stop with all of this madness
Boy, respect and honor yo daddy
Call me father!
Where the hell you thought you got your talent
Go ahead and use it, just pay taxes
Some of y'all abuse it, and I’m not flattered!
Leathaface about to break savage
Make no mistake on me slackin
Good-good thing they know that i'm packing
Bitch, inside these drawers I got action
Spit it to the rhythm and I hit em like a magnum
When I finish, I'ma send ‘em to the dragon
To the dungeon, put em back in, where they come from
I won't have it, yeah
These niggas thinking they can keep up with the flow
Niggas get the money cause you go for what you know
Imma let a nigga know to never battle BONE
On my soul, I'm no ho, go!

Hook:
The game made a beast out of me
I’m a monster!
The game made a beast out of me
I’m a monster!
The game made a beast out of me
I’m a monster!

Who the hell I get the most?
A nigga representing all sides of the coast
And I originated from five of the coldest
But now I gotta hold it down and control it
Now, now, now!
BONE underrated, it’s an understatement
I’ll never pay attention till a nigga come flagrant
Then i'ma get the pump out the trunk and puff blaze em
Ain’t it amazing?
So many try sound like Krayzie
So many try to get down like Layzie
I think it’s time to get Bizzy
And make a nigga Wish the Flesh don't get illy silly
You think I’m gonna fall off?
Well, if I’m falling, I’m taking all y'all
Cause the king will be dead
Thought I was dead
But the boss don’t eat, believe we’re going to all starve
Your favorite rapper I burned them
Those haters on me I merc'd em
You won’t fade to black with close curtains
And everything I sing in the rap is flow certain
Nigga, we came in the game and we changed things
Made braids mainstream
Made everybody wanna harmonize in their raps
Even when they can’t sing
Ain't we some of the livest niggas you probably ever heard of
And the verdict after they heard us
Was life! Them niggas is murder!
Superb when I serve my words
When it’s my turn, I’mma hit it with the burner
To the scene of black Katrina fight like Ike and Tina Turner
Now I got ‘em all shook
So I’mma keep coming on hill with that hook
You better be a woman up here with that look
Even coming with the strength of a bull you'll get took
I can go over days and days on how I’m amazing
In so many ways I can’t even really explain how I sustain it!
My page is really insane with it
Is losing the mind
Something is telling them kids might die
And I’m gonna take them to the other side once I apply!
Them niggas ..rhythm , ride, ride!
KrayJack yo boss is up in this building
Shorts and losses, ain't what I’m feeling
So I aim at yall for the killing!

Hook:
The game made a beast out of me
I’m a monster!
The game made a beast out of me
I’m a monster!
The game made a beast out of me
I’m a monster!
The game made a beast out of me
I’m a monster!
The game made a beast out of me
I’m a monster!
The game made a beast out of me
I’m a monster!
