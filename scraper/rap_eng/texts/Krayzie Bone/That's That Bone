(Wish Bone)
You can call it what you want to
Respect when we roll through
Fight like yeah, Thats just what we bust through
Swear niggas straight thugs
Really nigga rolled up
Layed out
Blacked out
Know niggas fucked up
It dont really matter
They scatter
We bustin'
So fuck'em
Let 'em lay
I ain't really playin, niggas playin
Bone ass niggas down, to me that shit is gay
Better than my black gauge too
Hear ya blountin buddy but my eyes on you
Watch that step, do what I gotta do
Gotta go fuck in my hotel room
Its about that money that money gotta have me some
Money
Or else
Hit a nigga to the white meat
Gonna get me some money
I ain't gotta tell, a nigga know
When you fuckin with that bone better go for broke
It ain't really that serious betta let it go
Ain't no tellin where that might might just might go

(Krayzie Bone)
You niggas better wake up and smell
That marijuana inhale
That little ganja
And realize ya dealin with a monsta
Mastermind of rap and crime
I blast ya mind
Im so sick
But dont need to call a doctor
Cuz you won't find a cure for this
Besides I dont need no remedy, I'm already fixed
Nigga take a hit of this and you ain't never goin back
To that wack shit
Y'all know what clique got the hits
Wait a minute
Im sick of niggas gettin all the credit
For bein tough guys and ain't got the balls and said it
I read that little nigga when I seen him in the video
You can tell who really real and who really hoes
Just because you strike a pose in some pretty clothes
Really dont mean you niggas automatic criminals
You can pull that at the show
They dont really know
How a real nigga let the mutha fuckin trigger go

(Chorus) x 2
We them thuggish ruggish niggas that'll get in ya mind
With the reefer and the lyrics that a spit like a nine
It dont matter what we give em
Its a hit everytime
But you thats bone
Thats that bone!

(Kryazie Bone)
I told you nigga, you dealin with a beast
From the streets of clevland, down with Easy-E
Niggas give me a reason to keep that heat in the seat
But in my lap so I'm in position to bust back

(Wish Bone)
Guess who's back to shut the lights down
Screamin out thug and no you ain't none
Gotta do something
When we see we gon' run up on em, nigga gotta tell me
Somthin, somthin

(Krayzie Bone)
Take a journey to my violent side
The riots lie
Hit 'em with the silenced nine, a quiet mine
And still fuck the law, and any other nigga wanna run
Up, come on

(Wish Bone)
And its easy it dont take much to make ya blow
Before you hear it you gon' feel it
Stay locked and loaded
Thugs like us they dont make it get it straight dawg
Get rolled up
They gon' like it when we roll off

(Krayzie and Wish)
Mr. Sawed Off
Creepin through the fog
All y'all niggas die
Compitition dry
To see me wit a dollar
Gotta get it
Get with the lyrical killas from the 99
Spittin when I ride ride

(Wish Bone)
Know what you doin when you step, you can fall off
Hands up thugs comin through when we raw dawg
Everywhere we go yes its like that
Everywhere we roll strapped with black a thug ready to
Go...

(Chorus) x 6
We them thuggish ruggish niggas that'll get in ya mind
With the reefer and the lyrics that a spit like a nine
It dont matter what we give em
Its a hit everytime
But you thats bone
Thats that bone!
