[Verse One]
I wake up and I can see the sun shining
And the bright blue sky, natural high I'm vibing (Vibing)
I'm not evening gonna acknowledge my problems
Today I'm just going to run and hide from them I might dodge them (dodge them)
Today's feeling like my better day, finally I can celebrate
I'm not even high but I'm flying (flying)
Steady rising watch me elevate, to the clouds and levitate
I ain't even walking; I'm glidin' (glidin')
I see the police but they speed on pass me
Didn't even harasse me, waved at me, that was classic (man)
I see my child hood friend, but he smoking, but I don't know today it just seems like he's glowing
And I can't believe I haven't heard a gunshot yet (nope)
I'm feeling good and I haven't drunk one shot yet
So I say it's a wonderful day, let's parlay
You're invited to parlay, with me all day

[Hook]
Ain't nobody gon' break up my stride, go mess with my vibe, my high, not my day
My perfect, my day, its perfect, my day, it's perfect, my day, my perfect, my day
Ain't nobody gon' break up my stride, go mess with my vibe, my high, not my day
My perfect, my day, its perfect, my day, it's perfect, my day, my perfect, my day

[Verse Two]
Look up the block and I can see my partners chillin'
But they ain't slanging the rocks, they mentoring all the children
Teaching to grow up and be real man, so there ain't be no more graffiti on the buildings
Or inner-city dealings
I heard the Crips, and the Bloods drop their rags
And they decided to stick together, word up, I'm glad (for sure)
The vice lords, and the disciples are no longer rivals
They realized survival only works when we unite (oh)
They say the Mexican, and black man, is decked in? (then alright)
White pride co-insides with the African (Man)
If I didn't know no better, I swear I probably think I was dead and gone to heaven (no better)
The vibe is good and the airs so pleasant
Niggas that once were enemies is my brethren
I don't even need to smoke weed, I'm not stressin'
This is what life supposed to be, my blessing (blessing)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
If this is just a dream, let me dream the way I dream
Let me see, what I see, let me be what I want to be
It's my day (day, day), it's my day (day, day)
It's my day (day, day), it's my day (day, day)
It's my day

[Hook]
