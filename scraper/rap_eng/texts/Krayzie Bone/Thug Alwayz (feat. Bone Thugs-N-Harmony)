Layzie Bone:
Gotdamn, it feel good to be a thugsta--gettin' high, smokin' weed all day. Ain't
Got to listen to no bitches and I'm disrespectin' laws, just doin' it the Bone
Thug way. Yeah, nigga, you got to be crazy, fuckin' with Layzie, and all these
Mo Thug killas. We them ex-dopedealers and natural born cap-pealers. Feel us
Nigga, if you want. Ain't nothin' but a high caffiene hit. We kickin' that raw
Shit. Fuck the law, shit, been screamin' it for years. Ain't no fear in my
Heart, thanks to the Lord up above. And I got a grudge against the people that
Judge, give 'em no mercy, no love. Let me see you shoot that muthafucka, shoot
That nigga. Ride up, slip the clip in, any trippin', niggas spit that fire. We
Don't need no water, let this muthafucka burn, baby, and I know they hate me
Say lately, Layzie actin' shady. Hey, it's the #1 Assassin [that's me], they
Just can't understand. I fear no man, put it on my #1 grave, 'cause I'm a
Stand-up true thugsta in a league of my own. The city of Thieves is my home, and
I don't trust nann nigga. My mentality is thug, runnin' the streets sellin'
Drugs, off this nigga gettin' buzzed, packin' heat off in the club. Nigga, what?
Nigga, what? They sayin' that Bone was split up. Niggas is jealous, tellin'
Rumors and lies, can eat a dick up, nigga

Wish Bone:
Nigga, stay real. Thugs get high. While you call yourself a thug, that's how I
Feel inside. And we don't wanna hurt nobody, -body, but your fuckin' with us
And we shootin' up the party. Even if we're solo on some of that Bone shit we
Sayin', now you can bring it on, because we ready, we ready. Fuckin' with us is
Like fuckin' with no condom. That's dumb, better play with yourself. Nigga, I
Ain't the one. Ain't a thang changed: niggas still the same--made a little
Change, sendin' bullets to brain, fuck around, man. Nine millimeter, come and
Get some, get some. Shoot 'em with them hollows, 'cause you know he's got his
Vest on. And you didn't want it to come to this, did you? Fuckin' with them
Thugs: them niggas roll through. If you really want some, run [Krayzie: you
Better run], fuckin' with thug niggas--run, run

Krayzie:
Yeah, and nigga, come on. We ready for combat, but y'all ain't ready. Carry a
Deadly machete, shred 'em and stretched, now they human spaghetti, steady smooth
And very eager to bury enemies. If it be necessary, then nigga wet 'em, and
Better go get 'em. We pickin' 'em off with the heater 9-millimeter shit to sweep
The streets, make niggas retreat. That's heat. Now, I repeat: if you want some
Nigga come and get it, 'cause we still five, live, and vicious. Don't get it
Twisted, muthafucka. Run up on it whenever ya wanna get down and dirty. Still
Stand in the Land with the slugs in gun in my hand. Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy,Wish
And Flesh put it down to the north, south, east, and west. From back in the day
We claimin' the thuggish ruggish--no need to change it. Now everybody a thug. If
You real, throw it up, but if it's fake, kill 'em and put 'em in with the rest
Of them phonies. Fuck 'em, and yes, it's like that

Krayzie:
Always, always . . . What am I? What am I?
A thug always, -ways, -ways
Uh-huh, uh-huh
