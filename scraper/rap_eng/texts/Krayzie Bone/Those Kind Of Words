We won't stop hustling until we make it (X2)
Make it

Stop trying what never works
In my vocabulary
You won't find those kind of words
Do whatever necessary
(X2)

Ever since I was young and my mother told me I can make it
Even though daddy told me I'm just wasting my time, the mission was blind
The vision is clear, I'm seeing me shine
I've been through many dark tunnels, I pummel myself
Against the flesh I'm rumbling with myself
To reach the top I'm stumbling to prevail
But at least I got my feet planted so well
I don't really care about the women and the fame
All I really care about is money in the bank
Hundreds are the same so I hustle everyday
Stay strong to the finish
Just another day!
Never say never I know I can do better, you better get on my level
Imma stay on my criminals best
Never settle for minimum less

Stop trying what never works
In my vocabulary
You won't find those kind of words

I'm on my perfect timing shit
24/7 the grinder shit
Imma survivor let me remind ya that
I stay on some grimy shit
The thug mentality's is still in me
I gotta get up and go get it
Imma go get it
Imma be ready
I'm thinking wicked
Cause I'm thinking money mane
Strictly money mane
It's rough in the hood
Keep pushing, it'll never be enough in the hood
So we stuck in the hood
That's why nobody give a fuck in the hood
Always tough luck in the hood
So we posted on the block only option hustle your ass off
I was dealt a bad hand but I made good with bad cards

We hustle hard go hard
Go hard all night go hard
(X4)

So still I grind everyday
Until I rise, I'll be hustling hustling hustling hustling hustling hard

Stop trying what never works
In my vocabulary
You won't find those kind of words
Do whatever necessary
