[Intro: Layzie Bone]
(Yo, we violent,  what!?)
This is (I'm a straight ridah)
Another Self Entertainment production (I'm a straight ridah)
(I'm a straight ridah) Bone Thugs (I'm a straight ridah)
Hey Mook, that's that nigga right there dog (We straight ridaz)
That's the same nigga that was talkin' shit at the club, dog
Watch out

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
Swingin' at 'em, yeah I'm grindin', baby gettin' down with the best of them
You thought I would slip and fall, end up like the rest of them
That's what you expect from them, never the thugs, nigga this Bone
Whoop him like he stole somethin', beat him like I'm Roy Jones
And I thought I told you life is wicked fast, steady get up and get the cash
Stick 'em fast, niggas be lettin' this slip on past
Number one is up for grabs, I'ma be the victor man
Strong arm, take the shit, like I was the Peter man
Bulldoze against the grain, I always been a rebel dog
Kickin' ass, takin' names, on a whole 'nother level dog
Grown since a teenager, mobile phones and Sky Pagers
Brought up in the projects, now we ballin', skyscrapers
H2s and Escalades, customized, special made
Hollywood to Broadway, check it dog, we gettin' paid
Naw I ain't about to change, I'ma just continue grindin'
Bills paid, babies eatin', record sales steadily climbin'

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Ride or die
Ain't nothin' wrong, I'm ready to get the battle on
Ride or die
Waitin' for war, waitin' for warfare
Ride or die
Ain't nothin' wrong, I'm ready to get the battle on
Ride or die
Waitin' for war, waitin' for warfare

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
A nigga got a flow that's so sick, my shit is in critical condition
And if there's a cure for this, I don't need a fixin'
Gimme the blunt and let me split that shit, man hit that shit
We ain't smokin', rollin' no penners, we blow big fat spliffs
My nigga, just kick back with me, it's the thugs
That's runnin' this motherfucker so bitch answer to us
We the man, we the one
That started this thuggish ruggish, that rough and rugged shit
We ain't smokin' heat, tokin', fuck with me killer, fuck a bitch
I must admit these niggas, they caught on quick
Broads is gettin' pretty jealous 'cause they all on dick
Battle you with a rhyme, man I battle you with a nine
Millimeter heater, start the breathin' and stop the bleedin'
Thug niggas straight outta Cleveland, just released to the streets
Paper chasers player haters get pussies feet underneath, when I creep
So don't be fuckin' with Krayzie, I come through blazin'
With my Leatherface and sawed off, servin' niggas raw dog

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Ride or die
Ain't nothin' wrong, I'm ready to get the battle on
Ride or die
Waitin' for war, waitin' for warfare
Ride or die
Ain't nothin' wrong, I'm ready to get the battle on
Ride or die
Waitin' for war, waitin' for warfare

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Resurrection of the radical, none of these rappers compatible
Ready for combat, fanatical, tragedies never tattle
Automatic guns rattlin', moppin' up blood stains, grievance
And I done seen about everything in the world but Jesus
I bring the Armageddon, under war, one disciple
Tear it up and start it all over, let me rewrite the Bible
My shit's maniacal, drink Henny until I spit up bile
Livin' this crazy life, la vida loca
Baggin' that Coca Cola, poppin' that Motorola soldier
This shit is sizzlin', bullets are whistlin', bitch
I am the master of my destiny, never no De Milo
And no Jezebel, my sisters say don't let them broads stress me
I need the silence of the spirits, I am the lamb
These niggas gon' hate it, corrupt it again, hm
It's the religion of Abraham, where there were Muslim bastards
Catholic or Jewish, leave it to Christians, this is thug life niggas

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Ride or die
Ain't nothin' wrong, I'm ready to get the battle on
Ride or die
Waitin' for war, waitin' for warfare
Ride or die
Ain't nothin' wrong, I'm ready to get the battle on
Ride or die
Waitin' for war, waitin' for warfare, yeah
