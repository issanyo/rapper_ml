(Hook)
I've been up, I've been locked down
Done had to bury some of my realest niggas underground
Still I pray (Pray)
Lord Almighty, take me away (Away, away, away)
Won't you rescue me, rescue me, rescue me

I said, I've been up, I've been locked down
Done had to bury some of my realest niggas underground
Still I pray (Pray)
Lord Almighty, take me away (Take me away, away)
Won't you rescue me, rescue me, rescue me

(Verse 1)
When I got in this rap game
I got into repentin for all of the bad things
Erasin my bad name, who said that we can't change!?
But you know that this world that we live in is so cold and so wicked (Wicked)
Explicit (Oh, is it?)
The people who say they can fix it
Are the enemies, don't you listen?
They're only humaaan, pretending to be God, Allah, bullshit!
Nigga you play with the Lord, and by the sword you die
Even now, a nigga with money and power
Still can't compare with the Heavenly Father
Nigga when you forget who put'cha where ya at
He'll put'chu flat, on ya ass!
Niggas spend a little money, and they goin through the same thang
They forget where they came from, who made 'em, n' who gave him the world
You better think (think), stop, drop, and thank the Lordy-Lordy
That you ain't hungry no moooo', yeaaahh
Cause if you don't, he'll take it right back
And you're right back where you started, with jack shit
Nigga ya finished, done with, up shit quick, that's it (Uh-oh)
And actually, that's kinda fucked up that we gotta face the reality
And what goes up, sho' gotta come back down
Nigga, that's called gravity-gravity

(Hook)
I've been up, I've been locked down
Done had to bury some of my realest niggas underground
Still I pray (Pray)
Lord Almighty, take me away (Away, away, away)
Won't you rescue me, rescue me, rescue me

I said, I've been up, I've been locked down
Done had to bury some of my realest niggas underground
Still I pray (Pray)
Lord Almighty, take me away (Take me away, away)
Won't you rescue me, rescue me, rescue me

(Verse 2)
It's that same old shit in the hood everyday
Nigga try to make a livin, on the pay daily (Daily)
Six feet deep in that grave, and they never comin back no more
Like my boy, life destroyed
Put to rest, too soon
Death deal to me doom
That bloody murda (What did he say?)
Bloody mo murda-murda
Pour some out for all of my
Soldiers that died on the line
Think about'cha all the time
I guess I, say I
See ya at the crossroaaads (At the crossroaaads)
I'll see you at the crossroaaads (I'll see you at the crossroaaads)
I guess I'll see you at the crossroaaads
This soldier rests, while you sleeps
And every time we blow our weed, puff one for you and then Marie
We, dedicate this to all the casualties of... waaar
We gon' stay strong, and we gon' surely keep on movin on (Movin on-movin on-movin on)

(Hook)
I've been up, I've been locked down
Done had to bury some of my realest niggas underground
Still I pray (Pray)
Lord Almighty, take me away (Away, away, away)
Won't you rescue me, rescue me, rescue me

I said, I've been up, I've been locked down
Done had to bury some of my realest niggas underground
Still I pray (Pray)
Lord Almighty, take me away (Take me away, away)
Won't you rescue me, rescue me, rescue me

(Outro)
To all of my niggas in them cellllls (All of my niggas)
If you get that chance to raise hell, rebelll
Ready to riiiiiiiiot
Gettin ready to riiiiiiiiot
