Intro:
Fuckin stressing, Im stressed the fuck out, its like im caught in a motherfuckin maze or something mayne, nigga wanna be leaving this shit, but i know i can't, its like im trapped in this shit or something man, im going crazy in this motherfuckin, this shit is crazy

Verse:
Its like im a prisoner and i can't break out my hustle
Convicted and sentenced a victim
Just for being born in the struggle, that'll make it bubble
Get my ends right, trouble so im defending mine
Never sleep, i spend the night
Industries, i pimped the grind, hypnotized, I
Im walking dead ya'll, but i got the sawed-off that'll blow your head off
But the cash flow, get down low, you niggas become and example
Give'em a sample, watch out for the one-time
They know im active, they figure to these lil' niggas, my life is attractive (Ballin)
And its always cracking, and im always down to get into some action
And if i gotta blast it, you let tobacco get your ashes
Survive the madness cuz its all in my bloodline
Serving'em up, murdering ya, walking the thugline
Get higher, get higher, i never retire
Ima be out here on the grind till my life expire

Chorus
You can't win, theres something that keep pulling me back mayne
You can't get out the game
(4x)
Maybe i dont want to come back, maybe i dont need to come back
Maybe i dont want to come back, maybe i won't ever come back

Verse:
It seems with every step i take, im getting close to my grave
And i wish i could change, but a 9 to 5 to me is strain
See me bailing in the rain, sleet, snow, its no thang
And i got what you need, speed, dro to cocaine
Im a scandalous nigga, label me desperado
Might not survive tomorrow, living on time thats borrowed
Mama say im so much drama, dont know why im so cold
She said, "Maybe your just like your father, too bold"
Maybe im just like my brother, in there for 25 to life, why
This situation taking me under
This is what it sounds like, when thugs cry
When thugs ride, when the thugs die, die
Although im feeling so much pain dawg, i can't get out the game

Chorus: You can't win, theres something that keep pulling me back mayne
You can't get out the game
(4x)
Maybe i dont want to come back, maybe i dont need to come back
Maybe i dont want to come back, maybe i won't ever come back
