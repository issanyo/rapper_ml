[Krayzie Bone]
A girl like you in a world like this
A nigga gotta admit, she don't even exist
Cause she the kind of woman that's often hard to compare
She one of a kind, the kind you find very rare, very rare
She be always standing right there by my side
The type that make me feel like I'm alive
So I love her, put nothing else but God above her, next to my mother but I'm tellin' you my nigga that's it
There's nothing other

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
She very independent but she know I know she need me
Please believe she really the only reason
A nigga still breathing but now you leaving
Feel like I'm losing my breath, My heart beating slow
We had everything but we let it go
But I just don't know why we did that
Now I'm sittin' in the dark all alone
And I'm tryna figure out how I can get back to ya

[Chorus: Kaci Brown]
I miss our world
For a moment, a perfect world
We decided, we divided and now we can't return
I'll miss our world
We had a perfect world, for a moment
And I was, I was your girl

[Bizzy Bone]
I can hardly even trust anybody
That's how it is and I ain't sorry
I was sittin' at the bar drinkin' Henny at the party
It was on in mind, I'm from the land of the heartless
Couldn't give it a second, I think I better go
When you beefin' for nothin' and need somebody to beef with
Somebody to grief with, it's good
Some people can't handle alone and some can
Some people can handle the lust and some should

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
She very independent but she know I know she need me
Please believe she really the only reason
A nigga still breathing but now you leaving
Feel like I'm losing my breath, My heart beating slow
We had everything but we let it go
But I just don't know why we did that
Now I'm sittin' in the dark all alone
And I'm tryna figure out how I can get back to ya

[Chorus: Kaci Brown]
I miss our world
For a moment, a perfect world
We decided, we divided and now we can't return
I'll miss our world
We had a perfect world, for a moment
And I was, I was your girl

They decided we divided
Oh, we can't return
They decided we divided, they decided we divided
And now we can't return, now we can't return

I miss our world
For a moment, a perfect world
We decided, we divided and now we can't return
I'll miss our world
We had a perfect world, for a moment
And I was, I was your girl
