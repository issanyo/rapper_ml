[Intro]
Insanity, Insanity, Insanity
Leeson Bryce, Dave East, JL and Krayzie Bone
Let's go

[Verse 1: LeeSon Bryce]
Kind of insane, but really psycho
Taking the gamble, I'm wacko
A lot in the mind, here I go
Don't stress me out I'm [?]
I got leeches in one hand, a pocket of fake friends
I'm tryna be nice but I'm losin' my patience
There's no sense, after this I need a vacation
They wonder who I'm talkin' about, I'm good as a suspect
You better watch it if you're gonna play me
Wanna network but you're actin' really shady
On the other hand people comin' from the shadows
Can't stand this, I'm breaking up the jist slow
Snap, snap, snap, already won the battle
Feelin' we ain't want it, but we ain't even try though
Thinkin' we under but we are louder than thunder
Come under plunder when the lightning strike it boom, boom, boom, better get low

[Hook]
Am I going to hell? I cannot tell
My sanity's coming off the rails
I'll take the crown, I'll take it well
To raise me up, I must tear you down

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Better back up off me, nigga never no softy
Boy, I'll stop your heartbeat while you out here on the streets yelling out what you finna do to me
In the middle of your speech I'ma sweep you off your feet to sleep
Fucking with deez thugs
Keep thinkin' y'all don't bleed blood and I'ma make you a believer, pop-pop
Would you receive a-a motherfucking bullet from an automatic pistol
Hit you, him too and all the rest of them niggas with you got wit'cha
I'm a collective and quiet but surprise, nigga, I get live
Jumpin' up outta that buggy, dumpin', finna show these niggas a little somethin'
Reppin' shit for Thug Line, nigga, don't test mine, tryna run mine
Felt like my Mo' Thug niggas, so ball, show 'em the gun line

[Verse 3: JL]
These bitches drivin' me crazy
I am JL not JAY-Z
Th-th-these niggas couldn't keep up in a daydream
Speed three digits on the dash, escaping
Bitch, tell him, will somebody tell him that the bullshit to this tale ends
I be with the niggas bringin' all the fish scale in, yeah win
You come up with some money that you can spend, then again
Don't talk right, block transactions
Hate it when these no wind, grown men ass-kiss
Straight up and down like the clock hands at six
Hate fake love but I'm done givin' passes
You a lie more like CGI graphics
Find an internet thug's IP address
Pull up on his ass, I got somethin' to establish
You are more square than an iPhone app is
Hate a spy, I despise all these assholes
Hate it when niggas pop up, they cryin', make a sad post
Misery Loves Kompany, I ain't keepin' a mac close
Don't'chu really run from me, get 'em, dependin' at most
Nigga, you heard 'bout the move, need a new source
If I do come in with the crew, see the true force
You frontin', couldn't fuck with the dude's bars
Couldn't shoot nothin', wouldn't cut 52 cards
Lil' bitch

[Hook]
Am I going to hell? I cannot tell
My sanity's coming off the rails
I'll take the crown, I'll take it well
To raise me up, I must tear you down

[Verse 4: LeeSon Bryce]
I'm the mad hatter
I'm psycho but I keep my grin 'cause the pocket's getting fatter
Cooking' up the batter
Leeches on my platter
Roaches on my heaters, now I got them all scattered
Phony love around me got me crazy
Now they wanna work, I'm feelin' lazy
Light them on fire, take away desire
Pressure on the mental state, mind over matter
Sick and tired of all the fake affection
Phony love around me, almost took a new direction
Funny how it was yesterday you didn't feel me
Now they wanna click, all up on me tryna praise me
Come around my circle, yeah, you might wanna back off
If you come around me, I'll shoot your mask off
Hit you in the air from all across the nation
Hating on the success from my generation
Sanity, sanity got 'em hating' the remedy
Losin' all my sanity for the sake of amenity
For the sake of my vanity, takin' numbers so happily
Gonna tell ya so easily, tryna tear your reality
Takin' over so naturally, wipe away with the fallacies
Ain't gonna take it so easily, better check your reality
[?]
So I'm embracing reality, new [?] infinity
[?] wipe away the atrocity
Wipe away the insanity, insanity sanity
Maybe I'm a psycho
[?]
[?] tryna build up a rocket to the cosmos


I'ma let Dave East come and have that

[Verse 5: Dave East]

[Hook]
Am I going to hell, I cannot tell
My sanity's coming off the rails
I'll take the crown, I'll take it well
To raise me up, I must tear you down
