Raw, raw, raw. . 
Retaliation is a must, nigga
The enemy must suffer the muthafuckin' consequences
Deadly. . 
Yeah, I want all of these muthafuckas dead
I don't wanna see one muthafucka left breathin'
Kill all these muthafuckas

(Chorus)
Them niggas be killas
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period
Bloody, bloody murder. . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period
Killa . . .

I'm thuggin off in my house out in Cleveland
Weeded, I'm sleepin', P.O.D.'ed
Dozed off, but I was awakened by the telephone ringin'
I picked it up
Hello? At first, nobody would answer me, so I said it again
Hello? Somebody starts breathin'
Not thinkin', I hung up the phone
Niggas be playin' jokes, I payed it no mind
It could've been just my fuckin' friends
Then I sat back and closed my eyes
No more than four seconds, it rung again
Hello?   And why in the fuck is you playin'?
Somebody yelled out, "You die!"
Before I could even reply
Some nigga jumped right through the window buckin' a pistol
I jumped out of the chair, grabbed the bullets on the way to the stairs
Feelin' hot bullets fly over my head
Thinkin' for sure that I'm gonna be dead
Scared? Oh yeah!
So I turned around and ran out the backdoor instead
Them niggas was steadily buckin'
Whoever was dumpin', they surely did want me in the red
Continued to fled--hit a couple of fences
Thinkin' 'bout who could have did this?
Retaliation: I'll handle my business, kill 'em--as God as my witness
I called up my niggas; they ready for war
Kill 'em's the way that we even the score
If you did not come for war, what in the fuck you come here for?

(Chorus)x2
What you niggas be?  Killas . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period
Bloody, bloody murder . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period
Killa . . 

(Bam)
Five infrared dots, trail by these steel toes runnin' in your spot
You smokin' hot
Gather troops, destinations be your block
The stakes is high since '94
Got your tightest G for ransom
Maybe unhand 'em and let him go
Hell no, you shouldn't've chanced it
It's not essential, got smoked, only deaththreats on your boast
So take it as a quote, get violent if you see me, loc
We deadly--step, pay your sins, you'll die a thousand times
He's found with open eyes, and mesmerized, no vital signs
That's fifty mercenaries that blood money can't afford
Jump out of new Accords
??? got two swords
A deadly ?, fate been chosen
Get your eyes swollen
I roll and dreams we're golden, and now your hood we controllin'
You tellin' lies, caught you slippin' up at your Mama's house
Should've took you out, but I told my homies throw you out
Better thank your stars, relocate anywhere close to Mars
Stop actin' hard, you got more than you bargained for

(Chorus)
You niggas be killas
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period
Bloody, bloody murder . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period
Killa . . 

(Bam)
We leave 'em shell-shocked, forty Glocks and dirty looks and pop shotz
We verse 'em twice; murda books police, 'cause scared of heights
It's cowards versus niggas, been shook
Didn't recognize the way your body hangin' from a hook
Thugline don't play

(Krayzie)
Shit!
Dog, I done told 'em
We'll rode 'em
Ho ain't got no scrotum
Slippin' in a clip and reload 'em, and when they jump
Yeah, we gon' unload 'em, and hit 'em wherever, however they want it
We gon' make sure no one's alive or left to identify me
It ain't over until you die

(Chorus)
Them you niggas be killas
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period
Bloody, bloody murder . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period
Killa . . 

Them niggas be killas
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period
Bloody, bloody, murder
Don't be fuckin' with the killa, killa, killa, killa

Them you niggas be killas
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period
Bloody, bloody murder . . 
Payback is a bitch, and the bitch is on the period, period
