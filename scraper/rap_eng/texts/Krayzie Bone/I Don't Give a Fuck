[Chorus x2]

You been talkin', now we caught you
Bitch now its on
Thug line nor I don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck)
About you jumpin' up, actin' like you Krayzie
Cause you Hollywood niggas can't fade this

[Verse 1]
Turn off that muthafuckin' radio
And put in a CD or a tape
And let them thug niggas show
We comin' to invade your space
In your face like "Ho hey!"
The original, criminal, blowing up on these niggas
Give them something to listen to
Is Right back up in the house
Mastermind of rap or crime
Another clack of a nine
Damage your spine (spine)
Mash us and blast at your mind
Niggas really think i'm carin'
What they sayin' like they scarin' me
But all they talk is noise
I'm not a toy, so boy don't play with me
Thug Line, Thug Line
And yeah thats my clique (thats it)
And if niggas wanna trip
Then we can do this shit
I'm not no muthafucking ho-nigga
I came but i can go
So nigga come on
And let me know what you down to die for
Stay strapped these days cause i don't know who to trust
So I just point my gun everywhere when I bust
Fuck these niggas
I'm in your city, your TV and your radio
So don't act like i'm hiding
Nigga, y'all are just some scary-hoes

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
Why niggas be actin' like they know me?
Then talkin' my shit
All on my dick
Now nigga you know what we call them (A bitch, bitch)
I'm running from nobody and nothing
Motherfuck them if they coming
We'll be waiting with the pumps
And bucking slugs into they stomach
A hundred mini-missles won't miss you
I can bet you we hit you
Split 'em, get rid of 'em
10 of them, at the same time killin' em
Keep my presence to a minimum
But i'm in your vision
Every time you see the thug line
I'm on the front line
I love mine
I'm tellin' you now
We on a mission with no mercy
Wanna know how bad we wan't it?
Just say we thirsty for it
And any nigga trying to get up in my way
Might i say, them bitches beggin' for a beatin'
So we left 'em bleedin'
Competition (competition), to me is an enemy
So think before you come try to get in it with me
So you can frown all you want to
Get loud all you want to
But now we see you
What you gon' do?

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
Now if y'all really trying to get in some action
You heard my song
Come nigga, get at me
And bring your family
Cause we really need to practice
"Walk it, don't talk it", I say this time after time
Have the same nerve and courage when we see you outside
Online, all right
Lets get this party started, spark it
Thug style, showin' em love
But we stay heartless regardless
Hit 'em with bomb shit
Better ring the alarm
Its the thuggish ruggish niggas
Bustin' the guage with one arm
Like Vietnam, the enemies expendable, so fuck 'em
First time we warn 'em
Second time we storm 'em
Nigga, you don't get no three shots
We not playin', and I know they understand
They tried to test the man
But the man was really a man
So its the plan
Stay heated heavy and ready to die
If not then eat a magnum full of hollow point shots
I'm just tryin' to make my profit
Get up out of this shit
But until then I gotta cock my shit (I cock my shit)

[Chorus x2]
