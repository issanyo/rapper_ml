[Hook]
I don't know (X3)
I really don't know
I don't know (X3)

[Chorus]
Am I livin' life
Or am I in my grave right now
(X2)
Are we living' life
Or are we in our graves right now
(X2)

Cause I don't know
(Don't know where we going to)
I don't know
(Don't know what I'm going through)
I don't know
(Don't know where we going to)
I don't know
(Don't know what I'm going through, no, no)

[Verse 1]
I really don't know where I'm going to
If someone can show me a better way
Like minus the fame with none of the lames ain't gettin' around me
I move forward, watching like we soldiers
Heartless like we warriors
Maybe they let me game control us, they below us
They ask me if we really part of this illuminati
But there's never been a negotiations over my soul (oh no)
But there's plenty demons standing near me like right here beside me
Will somebody please tell me what they want
Cause I don't know
I don't know what they what the fuck want
So I mix Hennessey and puff blunts
I'm outta my mind, why do I stay high?
Sit back and watch the time fly by
I don't even know who I can trust no more
I don't even think I give a fuck no more
So cut the lights off and close my door
Middle finger up!.... Fuck yoooouuuuu

[Chorus]
Am I livin' life
Or am I in my grave right now
(X2)
Are we living' life
Or are we in our graves right now
(X2)

Cause I don't know
(Don't know where we going to)
I don't know
(Don't know what I'm going through)
I don't know
(Don't know where we going to)
I don't know
(Don't know what I'm going through, no, no)

[Verse 3]
Everybody surrounding me, crowding me, don't really know what they tryna get outta me
In my mind it's so cloudy I'm probably not thinking properly, blurry and sloppily
I feel like a zombie, I'm stumbly, wobbly
Cause the liquor has got to me
Got a spirit inside of me
That keep making me recall the seekers is blindin' me
I say maybe for family cause they keep telling me I need to search for the man in me
Let them get just a little bit a glimpse of my world
Maybe they can understand me
Maybe they may conceive that this shit is for real, not like a dream or a fantasy
If the devil really did come with a deal
Why would you even read it?
Why would you even entertain the thought
Or even believe it
I swear a lot of these niggas brains are washed
But it's not the cleanest
This where ya livin' the life but when that day you wake from dreamin'
You'll see the light, it's too late cause you were sleepin'

[Chorus]
Am I livin' life
Or am I in my grave right now
(X2)
Are we living' life
Or are we in our graves right now
(X2)

Cause I don't know
(Don't know where we going to)
I don't know
(Don't know what I'm going through)
I don't know
(Don't know where we going to)
I don't know
(Don't know what I'm going through, don't know
