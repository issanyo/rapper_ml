We slipping into the future, into the future [x2]

Everybody caught up in the matrix
Everybody roaming, so everybody zoning
Everybody blogging so an't no body talking
An't nobody speaking cause everybody tweeting
(they sleeping) I feel like I been living a lie
Paranoia got me tripping cause I thinking they're spying
On me - really got me feeling like I'm losing my mind
So I'm trying to keep my focus while I look at the time
They really trying to make us all slaves to the system
So can't nobody see their dark ways in the mischief
We all considered the prey, that's why they hit us with
The venom, to numb to us, to bring in, destruction
I'm feeling kind of distracted, and inactive
They taking over it's massive call it madness
I hate the devilish fashion with a passion
They taking over our lives, it's sad
It all comes down to power...

We slipping into the future, into the future [x4]

Into the future, one world order
Into the future, new world order
Into the future, one world order
Into the future, new world order

"We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations, a new world order
A world with a rule of law, not the law of the jungle, a law that governs the conduct of nations."

Keep slipping into the future [x4]
Keep slipping into the future
We slaves, (future) [x2]
(A new world order)
We slaves, (future) [x2]

We slipping into the future, into the future [x4]
