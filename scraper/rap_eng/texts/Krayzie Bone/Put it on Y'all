Put it on y'all...(*X4*)

[Verse 1]
We the survivors, the hustlers
Thugsters, the riders, runnin up on busters
Suprise 'em with guns and knuckles
They bound to be broke buckled
Been down before thuggish ruggish
Come around with my motherfuckers
And crowd keep it bumpin' lovely
This money do wonders for me
You know me from Bone Thugs, so show me some Bone love
My roadies has strong nutts, drink forty's and smoke blunts
Still, I'm givin' my shouts
To the St. Claire Thugs in the Glock, Glock
For the niggas on hot-blocks
Bustin' back at the cops boy
You can't stop me, I'm up in your shit like papparazzi
Competition is sloppy
Opposition not even worthy got me pumpin'
Krayzie be dumping, Wrappin up bloody bodies
Me never knew one that could fuck wit the toungue
We comin' to shoot up your posse
Shoot up your posse, You're dealin with trill niggas
If it comes to it real killas
On the road to this meal ticket
My pistol is still with me, the lyrics is ill wicked
And niggas is still trippin', and talkin' shit after this one
We gon' get up in that grill, hear me..

[Hook]
Won't think no more
Won't speak no more
Won't beef no more, once we put it on y'all
Won't think no more
Won't speak no more
Won't beef no more, once we put it on y'all

[Verse 2]
Ever since I complete my mission
Ten years and they still listenin'
When you see me you know me
But excuse me don't fuck with no bitch niggas
Eads blown, heads gone, if they step in Bone
We let 'em know, straight from the do', just where we comin' from
Let it go and reload, if you need some mo' let 'em know
There's mo', we split it, gon' pull it
No matter them thugs gon' get with ya killa
Day time or at night when your kissin' baby night-night
You can die, rock-a-bye, got thugs but they ain't leaders
We thugs for a fuckin' reason
Scuffed up, fucked up, leave 'em in the mud
That's how you gotta leave 'em, body bags
It's no trash bag, they pickin' up the pieces
Niggas is hungry Dogg, they flossin' so get 'em dogg
If bitches step on it too straight up thuggin' to get you
That Gucci, that bling ooh, gotta (?) with niggas
Who they will murder y'all, sit 'em up
And there and then we rush all y'all
That's thugster shit, that's how we roll..

[Hook]
Won't think no more
Won't speak no more
Won't beef no more, once we put it on y'all
Won't think no more
Won't speak no more
Won't beef no more, once we put it on y'all
