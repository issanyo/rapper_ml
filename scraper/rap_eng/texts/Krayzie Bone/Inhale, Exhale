Blaaaaze

We dedicate this one to the weed smokers all over the world
Whatchu smokin on, smokin on, smokin on, smokin on?

Inhale, Exhale (X8)

Light this heavy cause I really like to ease ya, ease ya, ease ya
Let me help you clear your mind and take flight, flight, flight
Let's keep it smoky, low key, rolley with some till we can't smoke anymore
We steady rolling more and more, more, more
And you know my niggas ready and we smoke that, that fire

Stay medicated
Repeat as we in meditation
So levitated
It's all about that elevation
Inhale, Exhale (X8)

Roll with me, I'll smoke with you
And be totally free, free, free
No worries cause I supply the weed
And we gon' get high today, day, day, day
I grow the tree
And may grope perfect potent leaves
Dro indeed
No mo seeds
Let me soothe ya
Yeah

Stay medicated
Repeat as we in meditation
So levitated
It's all about that elevation
Inhale, Exhale (X8)
