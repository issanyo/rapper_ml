[Verse 1: Flesh-N-Bone]
Here I come rollin' off with Mo Thugs
Trues humbly united gathering souls and bail
Livin' life daily, all tha way
Tha plan instead they put'em on ah self-destruct
But I don't wanna go to hell
Vix'n tha body does it tell'n explicit
For more'n I seen ya vision
And let never fiendin' catch us and ah schemin'
We'll drink foe tha way y'allz are breakin' me pan (hey man)
We born to tha weed it would grow
Didn't know tha Bone'd grown some
Buckaz gon' keep it right, just home
And searchin' wit they hustlin' (no matter)
Same time see tha Bone
They done have ah safe place foe my babies
Don't murda, brown up, so crazy get'n tha cruel
World, all made up it like hades
Don't make Flesh break down, sign sight, my pine
I'd hide drug dealaz I find my started
Try not to pine in my nine
I try to stay kind instead it plus pealin', plealin'
That splif, roll over that shove it
Find tha po po beatin', down ya doe and did it
To ya break and ya won't see tha busta faces
Here tha more, la for, killin' each other for witches and shoes
Shit it ain't nothin' to lose, we get ah drop in twos
Mo's Fools do nothin' and I tasts my turnin'
And passin' it out wit tha Layzie lil' Eazy, my mentor
Keep in, handin' over tha shoes, I go walkin' in
And baby had to go die bye bye
Wit tha cruel world take' 'em shed

[Chorus]
Why, why, why, are we
Living in a world world world so cruel?
Why, why, why, are we
Living in a world world world so cruel?

[Verse 2: Reverand Run]
This Reverend from heaven
Just makin' you feel 'bout these problems for Run
But neva go less, I'm fresh with Flesh
Tha solution's begun, gotta get y'all, hit y'all
Wit yo fellaz makin' dollaz and cents
But tha fact that wak rappaz
Be jealous make this Reverend intense
I'm flippin', I'm scrippin', I'm rippen' 'em down
They be burnin' my church
No lippin', I'm sippin', I'm tippin' my ground, gettin' first in my verse
Who got yo macho, shot yo kids, creepin' up on yo crew
It's kinda hot, y'all got yo bids, boy, and that how we do
What's tunnel mind it's soldiaz
I'm bought masterline at this line
These bookaz, that welfare line
And can forget that black on black crime
We livin', and driven, and giving them love
But what they do wit out heart
For takin' and breakin' and fakin' then jacks
Boy ya tear' 'em apart
Just livin' in ah world that's so so cruel
That's tha tape in yo deck
They take our money, rape our women, now come give you respect

[Interlude: Reverand Run]
And I believe, a lot of us shouldn't condemn these rappers
Because if nobody would ah told me about God
The church folks would ah been talkin' bad about me

[Chorus]
Why, why, why, are we
Living in a world world world so cruel?
Why, why, why, are we
Living in a world world world so cruel?

[Verse 3: Flesh-N-Bone]
Think 'bout tha in us too, me 1999
Than what would we do
We breakin' it'll make ah change, fool
Do somethin' knows quicker, it's all fake
Ya smoke tramps in our community flood
Wit ah master plan to get rid of ah sea me got crack
And all these diseases that make us immune
And ain't it ridiculous
Look at us strugglin', hustlin'
Gotta make ends meat to pay my bills
Gotta help ain't no grub on our grills
Stuffin' to ge to me fillin', that's only foe real, though
Still, people feel me
So many of y'all now diamonds on tha rough
Sho' nuff, better know us
When they get it, betta grip tight
Holdin my brothaz, we're marchin' soldiaz
And I told ya
And it showed, decievin', caught him on camera
Some coppaz got no love, they see a thug
Comin' up, steady peepin' to sweeta
Foe see murd, they need go just
Wanna help tha weed trust
Don't even run to pull ah gun and pop it
Tha blacker together mens, gather strong at last
Controllin' no mass, no more violence, gon' stop it
Grow up to be cloppaz, and I'm proud
Be keepin' my Lord's warch, and it's no
When you think it's sin, wanna l've by tha sword
Gotta die gash, ash to dust
They turnin' that passin' and not with tha less
Lil' Easy my mentor, king
Handin' over tha shoes, I go walkin' in
Fill us up on gag, betta pass with tha cruel world take 'em shed

[Chorus]
Why, why, why, are we
Living in a world world world so cruel?
Why, why, why, are we
Living in a world world world so cruel?
