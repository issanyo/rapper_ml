It's like a angel on your right shoulder
Devil on your left shoulder
And you just stuck right in the middle of 'em
Voices in ya head got you seeing red
But the spirit in ya heart got you fearing God (We alone)

Conflicted souls
Which way do you go
Follow your heart
Even if tomorrow is dark
Every day a challenge
Tryna find balance
Sorta savage how we find peace through the madness

Streets turn good kids into straight killas
Police supposed to protect us
But they still kill us
Listen, you want to know
Why they still feel us
We never stray from the coals
Still spitting the realest

Shit you ever wrote
Was to use and vote?Â (None)
Don't nobody up in office
Care about these coffins
Don't nobody up in Congress
Care about the mamas
Don't nobody up in Senate
Care about these children

Damn!
Dark days
Even darker nights
The stronger the soldier
The higher the price
Searching for truth
Reaching for the light
We all at war with ourselves
That eternal fight

Contemplating some mutilation
As I rest on my flesh
This test has got me staring through the pressure on deck
Look at me contesting myself
Feeling really upset with myself
It wasn't for marijuana
Man, a nigga probably woulda' been been myself

Sometime I hear voices
They putting it in my head
Cold sweat
Feeling void
Paranoid
I'm unfocused
Oh shit
I'm so caught up in my ways
I realize that I ain't even
Seen my darkest days, gemini

Leave me alone
Shh
The devil whispers to me
Even in my dreams
When I'm sleepin
He not stop tempting me
Sheesh
Swear to God
That he be my stronghold
My tower, my temple
My power, my pistol
The hour is crucial
Wish I was you too

This has been harder to maintain
As we come to the conclusion
Of these last days pursuing
Real life, no confusion
Stuck in these crooked systems
Delusion
Wanting nothing but an illusion
It's like internal warfare
Eternal battle I'm losing
Oh Lord, oh Lord

Dark days
Even darker nights
The stronger the soldier
The higher the price
Searching for truth
Reaching for the light
We all at war with ourselves
That eternal fight

Hood in the bag
The gift and the curse
The first shall be last
The last shall be first
Little kids being born
Addicted since birth
Got us searching for hope
Just lurking the earth

Black rain through the game
We stuck in the storm
Heart torn from the pain
Forever in mourn
It's like we stuck between the good and evil
Eternal fight
I'm still trying to find the good in people

Dark days
Even darker nights
The stronger the soldier
The higher the price
Searching for truth
Reaching for the light
We all at war with ourselves
That eternal fight
Man
