Okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay.... whaaa, okay

[Chorus]
You ride up to the club nigga, I don't give a fuck
Sick of yo' ass in the club bitch, I don't give a fuck
Drinkin' cris in the v.i., I don't give a fuck
Talkin' shit 'bout me, bitch I don't give a fuck
You gotta pocket full of money nigga, I don't give a fuck
You drinkin' off with them ho's bitch, I don't give a fuck
In the club wit yo' pussy click, I don't give a fuck
Security on my dick bitch, I don't give a fuck

Drop dem bow's on dem muthafuckin' pussy ass niggas
Drop dem bow's on dem muthafuckin' pussy ass niggas
I got that eastside wit me, I don't give a fuck
Got that westside wit me, I don't give a fuck

Drop dem bow's on dem muthafuckin' pussy ass niggas
Drop dem bow's on dem muthafuckin' pussy ass niggas
I got that north side wit me, I don't give a fuck
I got that southside wit me, I don't give a fuck

We rollin' deep in this bitch so fuck why'all niggas
We rollin' deep in this bitch so fuck why'all niggas
I got that dirty south wit me, I don't give a fuck
I got that midwest wit me, I don't give a fuck

If security step up we'll crush dem niggas
If security step up we'll crush dem niggas
I got that east coast wit me, I don't give a fuck
I got that west coast with me, I don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
Man I do this in spite, my mom ain't married, bitch I'm a bastard
Nigga I fuck over me, you know what I do to these rappers
They come in here huffin' and puffin'
And screamin' and cussin' and bustin' they verses

Nigga you betta calm yo' ass down unless you excited to see me in person
I'm rollin' with thugs and felons ughhh, that's 'cause it's own killaz
We gon' teach you ol' punk ass niggas to respect us authority figures
Throw one of a kind boy when we be pourin' up in the club

You're going down boy too bad fuck ya, sorry for ya
Listen let's not to get shook, but I ain't the one to come lookin'
Cause all I can tell the police is, I am not a crook
I fuck big fine bitches, my dick get hard, watch it grow

Then gimme fine head, blow my shotgun, tastes good don't it
Now tell me that ain't the life, tellin' me my niggas ain't for life
Now tell me that shit ain't tight
Tell me that why'all want to be just like me

I beat these bitches down, I watch these cowards up
Nigga you talkin' shit (huh) hoe you tryna power up

[Chorus]
Why'all niggas ain't ready for this, muthafuckas ain't steady for this
Cause why'all still ain't learn, nigga got a 4-4 cocked
In a flick so hot make a muthafucka feel that burn
Niggas say word, where da herb

You stay up off my dick don't back talk my nigga finna' get up in 'em
Back up off of this nigga
The one nigga that fucked up they shut up the talkin
Barkin' betta block 'em off the nigga talkin, sparkin

Betta watch and dodge and never mind he caught it
Where da thugs at up in this bitch, fuck a nigga up why'all represent
Gimme some gin, gimme some hen
Naw just gimme both and I'll mix it all in

Who want to take a lil' sip of this in, let me get ya twisted man
Niggas on fire, don't stop droppin' dem that's a lie, we just won't die
We come back flya than ever, higher than ever this time
Wit venomous rhymes

So any nigga want to get involved, what you think you can fuck wit my dogs
Nigga you thinkin' you rubbin' us while we're thuggin this
Did you think you can fuck wit us, bone, bone-bone-bone-bone
You ready to do this the hell with the song

We ain't gotta tell you it's on, you know this
Poppin' the Glock to put a stop to the ho shit
Why'all still can't fuck wit us and never will because
We too fuckin' cold, too fuckin bold
Got too many souljas ready to roll wit da goddamn bone

[Chorus]
