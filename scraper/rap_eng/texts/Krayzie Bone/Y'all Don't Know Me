[Krayzie - repeat 4x)
I'ts Krayzie Bone (Krayzie, Krayzie, Krayzie)

[Hook]
Homie, y'all don't know me (know me)
Mighta heard my name (my name)
Ain't nobody feelin hold me ( hold me)
Not in this game (not in this game)
Homie, y'all don't know me (know me)
Mighta heard my name (my name)
But ain't nobody goin to hold me(hold me)
Especially in this game

[Verse 1: Krayzie]
Excuse me, but do you know me?
You've seen me on TV and in the video
Got caught up in Crossroads forgot that we was criminals
That's right, we them same niggas to come up from nothin
To what up with them figures?
Nigga, my album got better thangs
And people changed when I got in the game
Niggas call me I don't even know how you know my name?
How the fuck you get my number?
What the fuck is going on?
Then I got these haters leavin threats on my phone
They messages be records that they made just for me
I'm not on that don't give a fuck if you rap faster than me
But when it come to being the realest niggas that ever did it
You know Bone Thugs gonna be contendin for that position
Listen, if y'all niggas wanna trip with us, bomb ya fall witcha dick in the
Dust
Get up, what up? Thought ya had me figured out you didn't
Remember next time, that last time that nigga wasn't bullshittin

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krayzie]
Homie, y'all don't know me
Y'all mighta heard my name once or twice
Don't start none (drama), won't be none (drama)
Cause however they want it, they can come get it believe I got it
Can't be faded keep thinkin Krayzie ain't really crazy
Haters, that pressin me to make me show this lately
Afraid that they mistaken that they thinkin Kray ain't hip, hip, hip
To those who pose as friends
But are phony before they can infiltrate but can't immitate us for long
They better not come talkin no shit cause I'm servin 'em some
And fuck whatcha heard, believe whatcha see please
Dap is cheap, dramatical action speaks
Did you hear it, hear it?
I know ya feel it, feel it the twelve gauge eruption

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krayzie]
We got a game full of clones that can't hold they own
So they be fast to bite
Nigga don't like Bone, then why the fuck you rappin like me bastard
You know you like it, nigga'z funny
Be bobbin they head to my music, but when they see me they mean muggin
Keep lookin ugly, niggas but jut don't jump
Cause I'm a nervous nigga, and I'll buck, buck, buck
Thug haters they get me violent
Cops make me riot
You bitches make me sick and tired, sin keeps me wide up
And I needs to be high, just for fuckin with y'all
And I dedicate this one to all them bustas I knew would fall
Had to get rid of the dead weight that was holdin me down (holdin me down)
The Thugline officials and it's goin down (down)
So wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dawg
No need, don't even try to fade us, y'all
Who the nigga in the halls, big balls?
That's Sawed Off Slim
Don't try to get with him cause playa, playa

[Hook 'til fade]
