Little Eazy's last niggas
New wave for the golden age
That's when it was 'Pac and Big
And a lot just had to change
That's when if you popped your shit
Better defend the home plate
Had to be tough
Survival was the one, it was willing to catch the case
The bible was San Augustus waters
Like the trials was
Who keep the files cause
Time will travel miles cuz
Keep my love, keep my blood
But I think my smile was
Rest in peace Eazy

When the world has you cornered
And you can't make a way
As time is growing shorter
Not much more you can take
And all when I got it with you on my side

I'll be your fighter
I'll be ruthless for you
(X2)

[Krayzie Bone]
When the world is on your shoulder
I'll be there I'm your soldier
A friend like I'm supposed to be
To the end I rise, so row for me
I'ma be right by your side while everybody else is runnin' and hidin'
I'll be frontline
I'll be your light, be ready to guide ya, hide ya
So no mo pain can find ya
When you forget you the shit, I remind ya
God developed, designed ya
Look at yourself in the mirror, you're shinin'
Bling, bling, bling
Lot's of friends, we have them
But do we really have them?
Cause most em' are just past tense

[Eric Bellinger]
When the world has you cornered

I'll be your fighter
I'll be ruthless for you

[Layzie Bone]
When I said I was ride or die, man meant it
A hitter for life, eternal your henchman
Ready to roll, Ain't never no flinchin'
Larger than life, I respected your vision
In a split decision
We went to Cali to look for you G
I don't have to mention, you put us on and made history
Celebratin' your victory
Making sure that the whole world know you started this shit, we gon' finish this
And the message all over the globe
Heaven knows that we miss you
Never let nobody diss you
I go loco, ruthless, mental if they ever press the issue on you

[Eric Bellinger]
When the world has you cornered

I'll be ruthless for you

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Who can remember the game?
When we first crept and we came
Trials and tribulations
Just look at how the times have changed
Ain't no mo respect in the game
But I ain't gon' say no names
Homage need to be paid, you better be puttin' respect on the name
Remember ya'll used to hang out
Used to bang out, never took me lightly
Tryna get off on the 5th dog and I take a loss but that's not likely
Cause I've been a fighter all my life and I'ma remain that way
Still Ruthless for my dogs and those we lost until my dying day
