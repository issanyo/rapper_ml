Reinstated my lyrical content send other bitches to convents pray for me to be
Deleted but that's nonsense been the bomb since '74 Aries I can see how ya
Nigga be lookin' at me he wanna get in between the sheets leave the wallet and
The keys for me I ain't persuade that easily but if you spend the cheese for me

Broke the mold 6-0-6-4-4 when niggas are hauled off and hit you with the
Sawed-off seen plenty muthafuckas fall off with they drawers off when I'm
Finished droppin' 'em all off on the Westside of Chi I'm ridin' high thinkin'
Of ways to make it through the maze of the paper chase slidin' by keep a Luger
In the chamber ready for danger when it's time to die

Krayzie Bone:

Jermaine Dupri:
See everywhere I go I feel like niggas be tryin' to get me stuck I'm fly no
Matter what iced-up and all the hoes wanna fuck not to mention that a nigga got

Fuck with us like Busta Bust we dangerous and you know that if I peel I got
More y'all peel it's gone It's why the ice grill on when I wheel on by y'all
Niggas in the corner back and forth like "Fuck that little guy" don't worry

And how you sit around wishin' that a nigga was signed to So So Def I'm a
A-T-L-A-N-T-A nig never been known to play with can't none of y'all see so
Y'all niggas don't really need to say shit uh-uh with all your people hatin'
People hatin' and your bad looks what y'all need to do is shut up and take heed
To what my nigga's sayin' in the hook
