[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
Yeah, Kray Jackson
In the building right now, real smokey
With my lil nephew, Dizzy Wright (Wright, Wright)
Yeah, y'all know, we been doin' this man

[Hook: Dizzy Wright & Krayzie Bone]
(Smokin') don't you ever forget
We said puffin' on that strong, writing songs
Pack another cone (pack another cone, 'nother cone)
(Smokin') don't ever forget
We puffin' on that strong, writing songs
Pack another cone
Tell me whatchu on (whatchu on)
(Smokin') don't you ever forget
We said puffin' on that strong, writing songs
Pack another cone (pack another cone, 'nother cone)
(Smokin') don't ever forget
We puffin' on that strong, writing songs
Pack another cone
Tell me whatchu on

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Tell me whatchu on (you on)
Nigga my day been too long (been too long)
I'm tryna get stoned (Who tryna get stoned)
I'm tryna get stoned (Who tryna get stoned)
Tell me whatchu on (on)
Nigga my day been too long (been too long)
I'm tryna get stoned (Who tryna get stoned)
I'm tryna get stoned (Who tryna get stoned)
Who will I be gettin' high with today? (Who?)
Who will I be gettin' high with today? (Who?)
I'm talkin' 'bout dabs by the slab in the lab
You don't even know nothin' 'bout it
You tryna get this high? Little nigga I doubt it
Don't you ever forget

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I'm in my state of awareness, right now (right now, right now)
I can feel it so you know that clearly I'm high (I'm high, I'm high)
Split another swisher, keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it-
Split another swisher, keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it rollin'
Keep it rollin', keep it-
Mildly heat it, mildly heat it, mildly heat it
Hold it in until you get to chokin'
Blow it out and see how high you go (go, go, go, go)
When I be wingin', let us kill a bitch of hittin'
Cause we only twistin' sticky buddah
Potent dro (potent dro)
Out of my mind, that's how I like it
So like this, I'm (up, up)
But you need Bob Marley lungs
I hope you got some Bob Marley lungs (lungs, lungs)
