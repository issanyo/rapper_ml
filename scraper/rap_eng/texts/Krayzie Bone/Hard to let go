Woke up this morning
Glanced outside my bedroom window, I can see
My life so clearly in this place I'm not supposed to be
I can see the light now kinda dim really ain't that bright now
I need to get away right now
If I want to survive doing it now is the right time
I gotta try to save me
Anything I gotta do I gotta do it to protect my soul
The rich and the famous Dreams I had now i feelin like its time that I let them go
The times are changing
Now my mind realize all this evil won't let me grow
I can really see it i really believe it
But will I break free?
I don't know (I can see it clear now)
I don't know (It's ever so clear now)
It's hard to let go (I can see it clear now)
I don't know (It's ever so clear now)
It's hard to let go
