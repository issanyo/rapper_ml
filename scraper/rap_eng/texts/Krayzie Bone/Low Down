Rollin' too damn thick, nigga
What you hoes wanna do?
Ride, ride?
Die, die?

(Chours)

We low down, low down dirty shame
Niggas actin' strange
Catch a clip to the fuckin' brain
Shoot 'em down, now

(Souljah Boy)
Souljah Boy off in this muthafucka
Cause to point out the bitch-made suckas
Thinkin' they gotta enough heat to rush us
I'm a dust your ass off with the blink of an eye
You niggas gotta die
Don't ask me why
But still I try
With the vibes that I
Be givin', makin' money
Gettin

Ya'll shittin
Down to the fuckin' white meat
You hoes wanna find me
And my nigga Layzie Bone (...?...)
Ain't no comin' back, comin' back
Give me some of that good shit you smokin'
Got me gigged up
Heat it up
Lit it up

I'm hopin' that all y'all bustas got time to play
My nigga Tombstone
Krayzie Bone
Swing around your way
Your way

(Chours 2x)

(Krayzie)
Now what if we banged your brain
Put 'em in a coffin, and that's where they lay?
Nigga, wanna row the boat to get chromed
Dump 'em in the river
Now, that's how we play
Hey, murdered them niggas that's plottin' to rob me
Hollow point top in your body
Nigga fin to bless your soul with a twelve gauge Mossberg
Leavin' you stiff and cold
Nigga, what ya gonna do when
The muthafuckin' thugstas come for you?
You snooze, you lose, you catch this uzi
Nigga fin to shoot the po-po, too, and we do
Runnin' with a nigga with finger on his trigger
When I catch 'em, I fill 'em with ammunition
Hit 'em with the bullet and I really meant to get ya
They miss 'em
Hey, we down with the swangin'
No fake entertainin'
We quick when to fuck-a you up, oh my!
Gauges and uzis and three fifty-sevens
We load 'em and shoot for your head. You die!
Niggas, they better test me
Leatherface quick when he pull out this weapon. [Hey.]
We leavin' 'em headless
Respect them Clair playas, bitch

(Chours)

(Souljah Boy)
I'm on a mission [mission]
I'm swift when I empty my clip
You oughta' beat your ass
Real fast to safety, man
If a soldier's about to rip
You get lit, get hit
As I split your shit
Ain't worried 'bout a nigga tellin'
Yellin' muthafuckin' thangs
All you bitches [soldiers] gon' lay stiff
As I shift with my grip off into a whole new level

(Krayzie)
Gon' on my click, and now you're dead wrong [dead wrong]
Rest in peace
They seem to be creepin' up on me lately
Fuck it, let's all go crazy
Sell weed daily
And we ready
My thugstas love
When we buck buck
Put 'em underground, fuck 'em
Krayzie release them shells
I say, "say fuck it, let's all go to Hell,"
Cause I got my money
My pistol
My reefer
Never forget my thugs, what?
Hey, we slay
We spray

(Souljah Boy)
We pray everyday
But still I see that you and me
Just don't mix
So I grab my grip
I'm a kill your click
That's the end of this shit
So don't you ever
In your muthafuckin' life try to test me
Steppin' like Rambo with this bulletproof vest and with a knife
You better respect me
Or I won't think twice
I'm killin' your wife
Your bitch get sniped just like Wesley
Don't test me
Don't press me
Krayzie Bone will open up they chest, G

(Krayzie/Souljah Boy)

Yeah, niggas [Nigga, yeah nigga]
Yeah, ho-ass niggas, y'all muthafuckas

Niggas ain't ready.] Bone shut shit down

Soldiers, soldiers, soldiers]
Ho-ass muthafuckin' bitches
