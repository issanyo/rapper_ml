Chorus
I just wanna fly away
Cause I'm tired of the games they're playin'
Always flying with heat
I just wanna fly away
Cause you can't break my world
Cause this is my legacy
(2x)
Verse 1
Sometimes I wish I could just take flight
Blast off into the sky
I wanna be free from all of my dramas mayn
There gotta be more to life
Too many demons around me, too many evil people sceaming around me, listen me, drowns me
And I whether be in the cloud, I'm having my vision cloudy
World so cold, the cold is freezing out here
If you're gonna come out, it's your own risk
Cause you won't believe what's out here, we don't even need what's out here
So I just wanna fly away
It's better to be drifting with the winding to my dying day
Fly like an eagle
Let me go, let me glow, let me shine, you're here to twist things up, let me ride
I don't wanna reside there
You can let me out the sky playa, really I'm already feeling this natural high playa, I swear
And there's nothing like a floating by, if life was priceless, open that (?)
Found my life and soul and die, I gotta keep fighting fam
But I'm getting tired man
Cause the game is getting stressfull everyday
I gotta whistle with the devil
Chorus (2x)
I just wanna fly away
Cause I'm tired of the games they're playin'
Always flying with heat
I just wanna fly away
Cause you can't break my world
Cause this is my legacy
(2x)
Verse 2
I'm done with all this (?) griming business, partner sharp cause man I'm heartless
So I got a higher expense of lawyers, all this making me nauseous
But I think I'ma chock it, I'ma leave it all, book my flight
Look, tonight, they gonna go runnin' a nigga like me, the ship, the (site?)
Look up in the sky
Is it a bird, a plane, no way, it's Krayzie Jackson
They say what do you do way up there in the air, they can imagine!
So we (reason?) pass 'em, like a flocka bird, mark my words
How am I even an artist, madness, badness I absorb, so I emerge
Rise up!
I done I've told 'em they can meet me up in the sky
But they came late, and now I'm in my spaceship
(When and ever?) through the stars, keeping it moving on, need to pause
I'm defined to lord's gravity ya'll, (Atheny?) has evolved, gotta see (?), and I'ma march, post it
And I feel like comin' foe, cause, right here so I'm focused
I hope I die coastin'
So if you wanna get away, come and ride with me
Jump in the flight and (?) the skys with me
Chorus
I just wanna fly away
Cause I'm tired of the games they're playin'
Always flying with heat
I just wanna fly away
Cause you can't break my world
Cause this is my legacy
(2x)
The life, the life *echoes*
