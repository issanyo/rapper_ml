[Intro]
Paper part two, part two (remix)
You better go get it (remix)
You better go get it, get it, get it (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, you better go get that, get that, get that, get that (paper, paper)

[Chorus]
Green (ching, ching, ching, ching) either make it or take your money, money
Make some money, money, money
Get you some paper
Green (ching, ching, ching, ching) either make it or take your money, money
Take some money, money, money

[Verse 1]
Hundred dolla bill y'all
Its funny, we make money but then they kill y'all
People get murdered for money
That there is real, dawg
Cash money, money, money
When you ain't got it ain't nothin' funny
Don't look so serious
We lust for money
We get it then act a fool with it
Hey! Spend it up
Cuz it ain't nothin' else to do with it
Cuz you can't take it with you when you're in the coffin (naw)
So spend it, you better go get to flossin'
Cuz we do, we do
Now, what ya heard?
Do what you want
Go get your dough
Some people got it but they still want more
I can't understand why so many people out here broke and poor when money made outta paper!
Shame!
So we gotta get it ourselves by any means necessary
Even if it means we visit the cemetery
Ain't it scary?
Get a little dough!
And you become a target
When you become large its hard to dodge it
We all want the money
And we would all prefer them in hundreds
So many of us die cuz too many of us tryin' (thats real, that's real)
I know thats real, y'all feel me?
So many homies pretend to be my friend but in the end they'll kill me
And it was all over money, money, money
The money, money, money (money, money)
I bet it be all over money, money (money)
The money, money, money (money, money)

[Chorus]
Green (ching, ching, ching, ching) either make it or take your money, money
Make some money, money, money
Get you some paper
Green (ching, ching, ching, ching) either make it or take your money, money
Take some money, money, money
Hundred dolla bill
Cash money, cash money, money, money
(Cold!) cash money
Get'chu some paper
Cash money, cash money, money, money
Cash money, money
Dollar bill y'all (green) (x8)
Gotta get mine, mine, mine
I gotta get mine, mine, mine (x3)
Get'chu some paper, get'chu some paper
Get'chu some paper (paper)
Get'chu some paper!
Get'chu some paper, get'chu some paper
Get'chu some paper, paper (paper)
Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Big hundred dollar bill
Hundred dollar bill
Money, money, money, money, money (yeah)
Yeah, you better go get that, get that, get that, get that (paper, paper)

[Chorus x 2]
Green (ching, ching, ching, ching) either make it or take your money, money
Make some money, money, money
Get you some paper
Green (ching, ching, ching, ching) either make it or take your money, money
Take some money, money, money
