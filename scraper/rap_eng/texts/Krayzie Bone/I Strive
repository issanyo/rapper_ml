[Hook]
Cause I'm a hustla
I strive (cause I'm a hustla) [x8]

[Verse 1]
I know ya'll niggas wanna see me fall
Ya'll niggas don't wanna see me ball
Haters hatin hard
Because da way I play my cards
Krayzie scrape the yard
And I'm takin it all just like I hitcha hard and kill em
Dead, diminished, enough said
Mr. don't trust feds the reason we got the ghetto on lock still
Cause we da truth and ya'll not real
Spit at the youth when I'm in the booth 100 proof
This is what we do
No what I mean
I'm a tip top, hip hop hustla man
They say dat nigga really skinny but he muscled da game
Don't even want no mo fame
Just write the check, nigga, yes, nigga
And show me some love cause I'm fresh and the best in here
They try to block my shine but can't stop my glow
Dis time he shock em every time follow by a 44
I might not been in the scene but I'm always in the picture
Still I shine so my life is like one big, ghetto mix-up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They wonder how I'm so appealing, and I'm still aimed for da killin(I'm warning ya)
It ain't no issue, we official when it's time to handle business(we warriors)
Yep I'm a survivor, rider, struggla, striver, real provider, can make it happen like Macgyver, entrepreneur ain't nothin to it I'm a rise up
Shook all em bustas who never thought I neva wise up
Game, I been on the the running before I recognize game
I see it coming and keep pushin' my way, stay sucka free if I can I don't even want dem haters to even shake my hand
If it ain't about no dollas, no don't even holla, so don't even bother
Don't even waste my time cause I done come up from the bottom, broke
Grew up without no dough, so sometimes I hate my life

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
100 dolla bills, I'm addicted to scrill ya'll
Just can't get out da game, you can't win
All you can do is maintain
Do whatcha got to do, you gotta look after you
Getcha grind on If you a hustla [x4]
Don't get to close to them suckas or bustas
We gotta make sure they respect the true thugstas
My time, my grind, I'm tryna find my shine today
Subtracting all distractions out my way
So come out now and give us all some real love ???
And get some money with da real thugs
Now watch me creep up on a rise
You gotta get yours, I gotta get mine
