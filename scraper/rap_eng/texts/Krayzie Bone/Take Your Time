The word "love" is a hell of a word to be sayin'
You don't know how to use it with caution
It's a death-defying game to play
And when you're thinking of the one you wanna get next to
Be sure it's a mutual feeling
'cause these are the words they'll say

"Hey, baby, you're the only one I'm on"
They kick a few lines from a slow song
Having you thinking you got it going on so strong
And can't nothing in this world go wrong
They say, "Baby, I'm yours
So go and close the bedroom door
Make sure the binds are closed"
Yo keep you comin' up out your clothes
The next day they don't know you no more
So, baby, take your time
Help me, ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you wanna do me
It's so hard to find a one-of-a-kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
The next day somebody else is misled

Who do you  love? (You have to ask yourself)
Is it someone you can count on?
Someone who's there for you
Someone who will be true
No matter what the situation may be
And are they sent from above?
This question is asked for a reason
'Cause some of them wanna play
And then go their separate ways
And hey, these are the words they'll say

Ain't never had game, I shot real, shot real
'Cause complications in your conversation
So you know it ain't real, gotta be real
So why you keep fallin' for lames and games?
Shame shame shame
How many strippings you wanna take
Until you learn the game's another definition for play?
So, won't ya ease-a your mind and block out all distraction
Take your time
Take your time
Slow down [slow down] your action
Ya see, 'cause that's your disaster

Take your time
Ease my mind (Baby, won't you take your time?)
Take your time, help me ease my mind
Every little chance you get, you wanna do me
It's so hard to find, I'm one of a kind
And when these words are said
Don't let it get to your head
Once the lights go out
You'll hear a scream and shout
