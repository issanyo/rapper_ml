[Hook x2]
I'm a legend (salute!)
I'm a legend (salute!)
I'm a legend (salute!)
I'm a legend (salute!)
They gone read about me!
They gone read about me!
They gone read about me!
They know about you!

[Verse 1]
Here they go again I pull and steal them with the flow
They runnin 'cause they know I'm bout to murder with the blow
They bigger [?]
Get the chrome [?]
So I kill 'em with the rhythm after they have heard about it they can [?] tell 'em it's true (yeah!)
I'm deadly with the lyrical rhythm [?] it'll be like you know who (yeah)
Never be another I'm too aware
Come and try and get it if you dare
[?] you better beware, be prepared
[?] warfare (ha!) we there
When they read about me, they'll believe about me
Niggas see that the game couldn't breath without me
Tryna leave without me, didn't need anybody
[?]

[Bridge 1]
So I'm sending a message, don't fall victim to my methods, don't be dumb
Don't be stressing, 'cause you'll never get close to Leatherface
Get your sounds!
It's amazing! Truly amazing!
The words I keep it consistent and I do this simply by being original
Not a myth but I'm a legend, give my gift to pass the present
And nigga let's shift, shift, some ready
We deadly, quicker than we can [?]
Learn the lesson, tell them niggas class is now in session, my suggestion:
You need to research my work 'cause all of my work say

[Hook x2]
I'm a legend (salute!)
I'm a legend (salute!)
I'm a legend (salute!)
I'm a legend (salute!)
They gone read about me!
They gone read about me!
They gone read about me!
They know about you!

[Verse 2]
Ain't no other niggas that can see me on the microphone
And I said it but they wouldn't admit it
So put your money where your mouth is, nigga let's get it
Ready, set it [?]
No competition I told y'all niggas
Went a little further then I showed y'all niggas
Now think about this: where they get this down from?
All they gotta do is go and listen to the album
You can see that [?] my children, illegitimate bastards
[?]
[?]
[?] with this magic
Y'all got hits but Bone Thugs got classics
Extraordinary, y'all niggas average
Still keep it automatic [?]
[?] I'll blast

[Bridge 2]
I don't really care who the fastest
Nigga, show me who more accurate, who's more active?
Who's got talent and who's just acting?
Fakin it 'till they make it, niggas blasting
I ain't never scared
I'm coming forever prepared
And my tennants, you better beware
All the fame and you know I'll be there
When my mic hot in the right spot when the lights on and my lyrical verbal strongs
Coming on once again it's on, I'm on my Bone, Bone, Bone
This organic, nobody that's here on this planet can handle the question
So I'm stressing, hardcore flexing, who the best is, no guessing

[Hook x2]
I'm a legend (salute!)
I'm a legend (salute!)
I'm a legend (salute!)
I'm a legend (salute!)
They gone read about me!
They gone read about me!
They gone read about me!
They know about you!
