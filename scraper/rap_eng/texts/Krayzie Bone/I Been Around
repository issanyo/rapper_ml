Oooooohhhh Lo di da di da da da
I been around, I been around
I been around, baby I been around
I been around, baby I been around (wait)

Before ya get ta tellin me lie, I just wanna say, girl I knew the game all the time
I knew the game all the time
Thought I was blinded, n simple minded
But girl I can see, the evil in ya eye
Look baby I been around n I know ya kind n how they do ya
Yah, I must got x-ray vision cause I see right through ya
I'm through with'cha games, cause I don't like to play
So you go ya way, n I'll do my thang

I been around, baby I been around
I'm not tryin ta play with you no more

I been around, baby I been around
It's the same ol same, we been there before

I been around, baby I been around
I think it would be best if I just go

I been around, baby I been around
La di da di da

So now your tryin ta tell me that, your havin my baby, my baby
But'cha see every thing that I been through with you is got me lookin at ya crazy
I'm thinkin maybe
You could be trickin me, plottin on stickin me
But I ain't the one, I really ain't the one
To get over on easily
I guess your just startin ta realize that you had a good thang
But it's too late, cause I'm on the next plane

[Chorus]
I been around, baby I been around
I'm not tryin ta play with you no more

I been around, baby I been around
It's the same ol same, we been there before

I been around, baby I been around
I think it would be best if I just go

I been around, baby I been around
La di da di da

You felt this way you could get some franklins
To satisfy your way in this same game that ya play
You lost, you was wrong, gonna cost, cause I'm gone

I been around, baby I been around
I'm not tryin ta play with you no more

I been around, baby I been around
It's the same ol same, we been there before

I been around, baby I been around
I think it would be best if I just go

I been around, baby I been around
La di da di da

I'm not tryin ta play with you no more

It's the same ol same, we been there before

I think it would be best if I just go

La di da di da

I been around, baby I been around
I just wanna tell you girl, I been around

I been around, baby I been around
I seen all the games these silly women play

I been around, baby I been around
La da da da da da
I been around, baby I been around
I been around, baby I been around
I been around, baby I been around
