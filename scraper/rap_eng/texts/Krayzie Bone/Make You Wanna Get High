I was always told that I had skill
And I always known that I had it ill
So when I met Bone, the shit got real
Now it's been known for 20 somethin years

That truly really knows how to flip it em' with the rhyme
That's cause

Gotta different kind of sound
That's a classic kind of swag
No gimmicks, only style
Way more massive than the fad
No limits can be found in me
Ask me course, just ask
Just I'm the realist around
Not to brag but its just fact
That

They say we old timers
But the shit seems odd
We manage to do the job

True artist niggas calling Krayzie Picasso
Off the charts with the artistry
Sick with the high flow
From the start, from the heart
So why would I not grow?
From the dark into a spark
These niggas do not know

Kray got, the fire that gon' make you wanna smoke and get high

We something like implanted in the game
And that'll never change
Bone tat em' on the brain
So we forever remain
Of course we on a lane
And we can never be tamed
We sit back and do our thang
While we blaze
Flames

Forever will I reign
Forever on the throne
Forever I be Kray
On the stage, in my zone
Cause the stage is my home
No place like home
You can look but you will never find niggas like Bone, boooone

Kray got, the fire that gon' make you wanna smoke and get high

It's all original
Coming from the Cleveland criminal
