They see me rollin'
They hatin', patrollin', and tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
My music so loud
I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gone catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty (try and catch me, yeah)

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tense, so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by, they can see these gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Now ridin' with a new chick; she like, hold up
Next to the Play Station controlla
It's a full clip and my pistola send a jacker into a coma
Girl, you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' a bone ain't tryin' a have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in, ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned up all the way to the maximum
I got speakers some niggas tryin' a jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for um
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum, security cell
I'm grippin' oak (oak)
Music loud, and I'm tippin slow (slow)
Twins steady twistin' like, hit this dough
D's behind and it's in re-throwed
Windows down, gotta stop pollution
City change just like, who is that producin'?
That's the Playin' skills when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston, but I still ain't losin'

They see me rollin'
They hatin', patrollin', and tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
My music so loud
I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gone catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty

I've been drinkin' and smokin', holy shit 'cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home before the po-po's scope this
Big ol' Excursion just swervin', all up in the curb 'n
A nigga be sippin' on the Hennessey and the Gin again
It's in again we in the wind
Don't wanna hold up while I puff on the blunt
I roll another one up, and leave it like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
Forty ounce in my lap, freezin' my balls
Rollin' up a tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep me and my dogs
Yo', I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the six-five, and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block we creep, creep
Pop, pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key
With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em like, fuck 'em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Wonder if you want nigga it poppin' dog
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire (millionaire)

They see me rollin'
They hatin', patrollin', and tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty

They hopin' that they gone catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty
Tryin' a catch me ridin' dirty

You wouldn't think it so, I tried ta let ya go
Turn on my blanker light, and then I swang it slow
And they upset for fa sho'
'Cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro' (no)
So they get behind me, tryin' a catch my tags
Look in my rear view, and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong
They keep tryin' (keep tryin')
Steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags (tags)
Pull me over, try to check my slab (slab)
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
Bein' the balla that I am, I'm talk to them not givin' a
Damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood (Ha ha ha)
Then I'll laugh at you; then I'll have to cruise
Ya my number two on some old school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the laws. tell 'em we hate you
I could be tough, tell 'em that they should a known
Tippin' down, sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me
I'm 'bout to pull up at your home, and it's on
