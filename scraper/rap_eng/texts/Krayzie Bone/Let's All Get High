[INTRO : Cheech & Chong]

No stems, no seeds that you don't need
Acapulco Gold is badass weed

[Verse 1: Da Brat]
Somebody call the cops
Let 'em know the funk bandit's back
With more bounce to the ounce it's the brat tat tat tat
The funk-keeper
Competition's sweet but known for makin' speak
Cause bleed smokin haloweed
Givin' You what 'cha need
Indeed I'm nice
Jewelery full of ice
The industry ain't been the same
Since I came to sprinkle my spice
Tonight's the night and we gonna all get lifted
Recognize the gifted and how there's no fuckin' around
In the west-side district
Get it twisted
If you wanna choose your destiny
Leave all that simple shit at home
And bring your fuckin' best to me
Cause right here playtime stops
Okay, rhymes flop and all that real-deal shit hits tops
See I'm the cream of the crop, head bitch in charge
And there ain't nothin' or nobody that I've barred thus far
Repitoire full of wicked shit
Lay back kick a shit
All the right shit to give a nigga a hit

[Chorus: Da Brat]
If you let's nuthing hold you back
And your limit is the sky
Throw your hands in the air and let's all get high
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lay back hypnotized to the funky sound
If you let's nuthing hold you back
And your limit is the sky
Throw your hands in the air and let's all get high
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lay back hypnotized to the funky sound

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Now roll up a sac so that we can smoke it together
Now how high can you go cause you know we can choke
Take it slow, We smoking junk
Cause you rolling wit moe
We having a celebration
We doing this all night if you wanna get away
You can play em other times
And don't forget my niggas be doing this shit the thuggish way
We have you thugging where the thug lately? We Krayzie
But niggas don't drop we got the bud blaze-ay
So if you get out. Better get with this crowd
I bet you wanna get weeded
Fuck wit your thugs out of Cleveland
Stay peyoted and tweeded them thugs we blazing we fiending
Now can you feel this connect with So So Def Mo Thugs
My squad and yo posse my nigga we goin be alright
So come around everybody party down get down
And let that real shit hit yo' chest cause I know when I get that hydro
My nigga thugsta come and give me some love
Can somebody bang and slang yo' dog with couple of thugs from the
Cut

[Chorus: Da Brat]
You wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
We could all get high, get high
The shit we keep we got you hypnotized
Ain't nobody dealin' with me
My nigga J can get his smoke on man
Cause if we go broke you won't feel bad

[Verse 3: Da Brat]
Yeah. But there's enough hundreds for that to never happen in action
Certified platinum slashin' bastards
Draw shit faster than eastwoods, I wish you could be like me
I broke the Mo with fatality, visual shit that you can see
These synthetic niggas usually smoke refos with my peeps
Get deeper than any bitch
Watch me and yo' nigga creep
Sky's the limits, Damn them lights cause Krayzie got the Hydro
Inject a deadly venom grinnin' and watch them all die slow
We non-fictional characters carry grudges till it's dealt with
Underestimate the wrong bitch and get yo' shit spend
You better light a splife and mind yo' motherfuckin' business
Or get that ass put in the witness protection program
Till I'm finished, diminished
Your entourage is my level
Blindin' like the VVS rocks possessin' like the devil
Pushin' custom drop-tops
Keep Segante' in the glove box
Puffin' with crooked cops
And can't nuthing hold me back cause nigga my shit don't stop

[Chorus: Krayzie Bone] (repeat til fade)
You wanna fly, you wanna fly, you wanna fly
We could all get high, get high
