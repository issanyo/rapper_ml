I think I'm living in a nightmare
And you the villain so I think I'm captain save a hoe
Don't think you right ma'am
Don't think you loyal like you claim to be, I can't do it
I don't need no obligations, complications, I've been through it
Don't have patience for you fakeness
Bitch stop faking, stay true to it
Fake hoes, they so foolish
Stank hoe, exactly what you is, Jezebel!
She my Billy Jean bitch, beat it!
She phony and conceded, I don't need it
And a girl be for some other nigga, run the game on the sucka nigga
Cause I'ma learn ya, I ain't fuckin' with ya
I rather talk to myself, I rather walk by myself

I had a bad dream last night
You were standing in a different light
When I touch my eyes to wake up
They were opened all along

Now I'm shaked up
Bad dream, bad dream
Bad dream, bad dream
Bad dream, bad dream

I didn't find her in the black book
Found her in the back page
How the fuck she ever think that she was in my rat race
You little coke head slut, hey
Eat dick, you can stab me in the back after that, lil bitch
And I thought of, and all that little talk about a bitch I outta make you a reality show
Now I'm a start her off with somethin' to drink
And let me get this lil bitch a lil suck on my thing
I would rather talk to myself
I would rather walk by myself
And I really wanna call
I really wanna help
But really what I thought, was only what I felt, yeah
And now there's one side, and so I decided
The shit was too much pressure before it even gets violent
I know my level before a stupid bitch tries it
I blame the Devil before I let you be my tyrant

I had a bad dream last night

Now I'm shaked up
Bad dream, bad dream
Bad dream, bad dream
Bad dream, bad dream
