[Chorus] x2
T.H.U.G. we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin'
It's the way I choose to live my life
T.H.U.G. we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin'
Thuggin' 'til the day I die

[Verse 1]
I done been around the world and everywhere it be the same song
Niggas strugglin' daily gotta survive, it's worldwide
Even niggas from Paris to London be hustlin'
Doing whatever to get the money
Lookin' at the whole world wide of thugs, but you got to keep it real
If you want to make the it through with the biz
And make them dollars for your kids
Gotta handle your business, gotta get in it to win it and then you gotta get up outta there
And that's real really, my thugs feel me
Put your fists up in the air, yeah
Nigga come into the war and I'ma meet you niggas there
Ready to rumble, and I swear, we coming from everywhere
Where my thugs at, where they at? Fuck that
Nigga, let's do in the enemy now, terminate, eliminate 'em
Kickin' out the frustration, on the world
Get 'em back for playa hatin'
So come on we gotta roll, and wouldn't you know
They ain't ready for the war, all the rest take somethin'
Get the rest to the ?? the control
Make them feel the pain in 2-double-0-0
It's the end of the road, so what you gonna do?
I'ma ride, you can die if you want to
But all them real so just come on, move!
Get your suits on, boots on! Get your troopin' on!
T-H  (T-H) U-G (U-G), that's what we be
Across the nation, pump your fist and get ready for this occasion
And you better the fade on, I wanna see victory
Y'all niggas better roll with this, 'cause we splittin' 'em
Fuck that, we with it
That's thug mentality

[Chorus] x2
T.H.U.G. we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin'
It's the way I choose to live my life
T.H.U.G. we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin'
Thuggin' 'til the day I die

[Verse 2]
Every thug, if you wanna be a thug, nigga thug if you got to
Throw it up, keep it in the air, scream it out:
"Thug! Thug! Thug! Thug!" Thuggin' 'til the day I die
What am I? If you look into my eyes, you'll truly find
No kind like I, gemini, gotta control both sides
My lordy lord maintain, hard, 'cause I'm a soldier at war
Steady runnin' with the weapons 'cause it still ain't gettin' better
I figured it out, it's all real, if it ain't then it ain't right
Come on, if you wanna feel the thug love, and it's real
We got the real thing baby
I hate to burn ya, learn ya, stay out it if, it don't concern ya
You don't really want to get involved with the murder
But shit if you want it, you got it, we bring it, it don't stop
We gone pop shots still to the double Glock Glock
Never taking no shorts, no losses man
Yes, these days are still the same like, gotta make that money man
Bang, gotta get "Down For My Thang", and I do it so smooth
When I'm stalkin' gat fools, walkin' jack moves
Now I'm on the run witta me shotgun, but I'm blinded so
Y'all can't fuck with the thuggish ruggish (ruggish) Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
That's thug mentality

[Chorus] x2
T.H.U.G. we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin'
It's the way I choose to live my life
T.H.U.G. we be
That's thug mentality, we're thuggin'
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin'
Thuggin' 'til the day I die
