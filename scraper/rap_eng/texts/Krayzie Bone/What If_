[Chorus]
Time after time, I try to visualize life after life
As time passes by, I realize that I might not survive
(X2)

[Verse 1]
What if
It was the very last day upon earth and you got two minutes to pray, what would you ask for first?
What if
A supreme being didn't even exist? And what if life was really supposed to be like this?
What if
You woke up every morning and the sky was cloudy, no sunshine and it was dark nights like all the time?
And what if it was just cold weather, and it ain't looking life is getting no better?
What if you lost life and you didn't get to repent and spent your whole life playing both sides of the fence
And what if when you met your creator, he said it's too late to apologize?
Whatcha gon doooooo?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
What if
The end of days came and we was all slippin and God came for vengeance and we was caught sinning?
What if
There really is a God but we couldn't shake our pride long enough to recognize realize?
What if
What's in the scriptures of the bible is the truth and you been ignoring all the signs and all the proof?
What if I told y'all that I'm now a believer?! I followed up and turned into a leader!
What if I stayed blinded? I will probably end up like the rest of em, death to em
What if my one sided mind have me laying right next to em, next to em?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
What if
2Pac and Biggie never had beef and they both were still breathin'? Or what if we still was in that 600 benzo with Eazy
What if
Jam Master Jay was still jammin or Big Pun was still standin' and the whole Terror Squad was still family?
What if Michael Jackson was never blamed framed and assassinated? What if we found out it was fabricated. (It was made up)
Or what if Left Eye and Aalyiah was still livin' but we can take the pause so Whitney Houston spoke ever so clear now?
But if I died tomorrow, how long will they mourn me? How long will they reminisce before they move on? And what if I found out they never gave a damn about me? What if what if what if?

[Chorus]
