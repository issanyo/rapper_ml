[Krayzie ](2x)
I talk to myself (myself)
When there is no one to talk to

[Tiffany]
Ever wonder just what it's like talkin to yourself every night?
Will I ever make it through the day?

[Krayzie]
It's so hard to believe that I'm still living, I'm alive
My clock is still ticking
Guessing that God is still with me (with me)
Cuz I could have been gone so many times before
Murda Mo is chasing me I'm bearly escaping it
And my instincts is tellin me that I
Might not live long in my life (my life)
My life is a jungle I really don't love it it's really to crumble
I fight with these devils on daily basis
And I try to stay humble
Try not to fall, but what if I slip, trip?
Try to stay calm, but what if I flip?
Kill 'em all
Last night I had a long talk with myself (myself)
Drama had a nigga wondering, wondering
How close am I to hell?
Then I had to pray can't let them brake me, aw nah (aw nah)
But it's everyday they try to make me soft
But so fried, so high is my mind state
Don't worry when I'm in the clouds
Well that's how I stay (stay)

[Hook: Tiffany]
Ever wonder just what it's like talkin to yourself every night?
Will I ever make it through the day?
Never thought I make it this far
Kinda wonder just where you are?
Will you ever make it through the day?

[Verse 2: Krayzie]
Caught up in all my complications, nowhere to go
It's mandatory that I face them, even though I don't want to
They say karma can murda ya, murda ya
All this drama just got me nervous, cuz I know i've popped
Shots that don't stop, they don't stop
Soon as I lose it they know I get stupid
Ain't nowhere to you, to you
Stop, stop, look, look, listen, we heard
I'm hearin they're out to get me (get me)
Can't let 'em get me
I won't stop dumpin until my clip is empty (empty)
When this one finish (finish)
I'm buckin 'til I put my other clip in (clip in)
Then get up spittin back at y'all (back at y'all)
That's cuz they can't get with this at all
The war is really raw, really raw (raw, raw)

[Krayzie & Tiffany]
Last night I had a long talk with myself
And I told myself I can't depend on one, no one else
Crazy, crazy this thing done made me crazy
Hate to say it, I went crazy
Crazy, crazy this thing done made me crazy
Hate to say it, I went crazy (crazy)
Walkin in the rain, walkin in the rain
Disaster calls my name, callin my name
Feelin so much pain
Wanna get away but ya can't, can't, run, run

I talk to myself (myself) when there is no one to talk to

Last night (myself) I had a long talk with myself, self, self
Will I ever (myself) make it through the day?
