[Intro]
Sitting back watching the Eye witness news, a channel I never seen
But the more I find out which Eye witnesses the world, I wonder who sees me
See, everyday i find myself taking the planets oldest remedy
Cause it makes the third Eye unblind to the mind destruction that's in plane visibility
I'm tripping off the mind manipulation that 85 percent of us don't have control of
And the 15 percent controlling the population of society don't remember where there soul was
New ages entertainment seems to be more of a fashion
While proper education seems to be more of a distraction

[Verse 1]
I'm staring at the world with my naked eye
Got a clear vision, so now I gotta testify
About real living, while I'm looking at the world news
Bad is good if you're looking through the world's view
Everybody wants to chase the devil
But they don't even know it because they're blinded
Distracted by the bright lights and diamonds
Everybody wants the nice life, reclining
Selling their souls and it's quite trifling
But the more I think about it
We don't even own our souls, they belong to God
So how we sold our souls?
Everybody's infatuated with this Illuminati
But it's all propaganda when you ask me
We in the last of the last days
And you can see it because everybody's increasing in their bad ways
And it's about to go from bad to worse
Trying to stay above the dirt
And outlast the curse

[Hook]
As we change in the ways of the future
We prepare for a new way of living
Though we can't seem to change our thinking
Holding on as the time keeps on slipping

[Verse 2]
Everybody asks me
What happened to conscious rap?
And I say we tell em'
The money and the power
MC's have been silenced by the dollar
So with the struggle they don't want to be bothered
Emergency, the game's unresponsive
Turn on the radio, you're listening to garbage
9 out of 10 of their hit songs is nonsense
I need somebody to tell me how they got in here
Hey young world (the world is stupid)
Hey young world, this ain't music
Hey young world, don't abuse it
Hey young world, don't be foolish
We in the last of the last days
And you can see it because everybody's increasing in their bad ways
And it's about to go from bad to worse
Trying to stay above the dirt
And outlast the curse

[Hook]
As we change in the waves of the future
We prepare for a new way of living
Though we can't seem to change our thinking
Holding on as the time keeps on slipping

[Bridge]
They don't know love, they don't know life
They don't know wrong, they don't know right
They don't know peace, they don't know treaty
They don't know me, they don't know you

[Outro]
Cold world
Freedom of speech in this country has always came with a cost
But the change in the first amendment, seems to be the first thing lost
Livelihood is less likely to be what it used to be
And the hatred we have within ourselves
Blindfolded us from the things that we should see
We pledge allegiance to a world with little or no religion
As we take a step closer to man's mission
Without vision

[Hook]
As we change in the waves of the future
We prepare for a new way of living
Though we can't seem to change our thinking
Holding on as the time keeps on slipping

[Additional outro]
Into the future we go
Where we'll end up, we never know
What about your future?
What about your future?
