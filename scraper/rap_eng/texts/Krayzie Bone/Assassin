[Intro]
It's going down
TL, alright
Y'all niggas have had enough time to fuck around with the game now, right?
Fuck that, hey yo, bar none

[Verse 1]
I'm on some other shit, suck up the game like Peter Drucker
Nigga can never touch us, bitch a sucker, nigga, fuck ya'
I hear a lot of rappers self-proclaiming titles
But they can't maintain survival if they can't sustain a right, blow
They ask me how I feel about these new rappers
I see a few cool cats, then again a few too trash for Kray
Won't even listen to these weirdos in their weird clothes
Let's make it clear, hoe, we don't speak the queer code
Niggas wearing dresses now, I'm 'posed to respect 'em, how?
We drip from the blood and the sweat of a real nigga
I keep it one-'hun, you can bet I'm a field nigga
Made us a couple of mill', no sweat, but we still niggas
So disgusted, won't even look in yo' face
Can't even look in ya' eye, you niggas such a disgrace
You need to fall off and die, I'll come and piss on ya' grave
You niggas looking surprised
They like, is this really Kray?

[Pre-Hook]
I'm an assassin, you know me bloody murder 187
Assassin, now come and meet the homies Smith and Wesson
I leave ya' dead - ya' dead, example for the next man
Not fucking with them Bone niggas was the best plan

[Hook]
I'm an assassin, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
It's murder, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
I'm an assassin, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
It's murder, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
I'm an assassin

[Post-Hook]
MCs, I don't care if you live
I don't mind if you die
It's death to you I vow, execution style

[Verse 2]
I hate to be offensive, but fuck you, if you offended
If you feeling defensive then, bitch get up and defend it
Never met any contender, never been no pretender
So remember, you don't know me, nigga
Don't act like the homie, nigga
I feel like Tony Montana, Godfather Gotti don da da
Bow down and suck a revolver, I bust, make you come harder
(swallow)
Checking niggas up off the hit list
Spray them bitches with this shit
We gon' bake 'em like Bisquick, lyrical misfit
We too legit to quit, like Hammer
We gon' hurt 'em, we gon' light 'em
We gon' burn 'em, we gon' kill 'em
We gon' murder 'em
Death to my competitors, guess it's a new day
'cause the prey is the predator

[Pre-Hook]
I'm an assassin, you know me bloody murder 187
Assassin, now come and meet the homies Smith and Wesson
I leave ya' dead - ya' dead, example for the next man
Not fucking with them Bone niggas was the best plan

[Hook]
I'm an assassin, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
It's murder, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
I'm an assassin, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
It's murder, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
I'm an assassin
