Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum {Throughout the whole song}
I bring yo' Thugline (y'all)
Don't they want to see me fall (y'all)
But I never had then I'm just to wrong (y'all)
You used to have a lot of devil scene (y'all)
When I kept my soul, they see me disappear (y'all)
And now the cryin on the line is perfect time
Tryin' shinnin', keep my mind, ready for combat
