[Krayzie:]
Yo! This ya boy Krayzie Jackson man. We gon' do this one foe the nigga's out there goin' hard foe that money

I go hard fo my money
Anything to get me paid
Go hard foe my money
I'm a go and get it man
I go hard foe my money
I'm a grind all night
Hard; I go hard [x2]

24/7 I'm out rakin' in my Franklin's
I'm just tryna make ends meet nigga, break bread
So lay there, play dead while I shake 'em down
Rippin' ya pockets takin' ya profit
Don't make a sound
If murda made me richa nigga, then I'd be a killa
If robbin' rappers was my practice I'd know how to get ya
I'm from the struggle, so you know what its in my blood to hustle
I gotta make somethin' bubble, while I muscle through the jungle
My everyday itinerary can be plenty scary
But yes it's necessary we take penitentiary chances
Fuck it, what's the risk? Especially one that can advance me
I need to put a payment down on my circumstances. (Yeah!)
I do the math but if the shit don't add up
I'm lookin' through a mask-"Nigga, give that cash up!"
If it's able to be sold, I'm  sell it
If it's real shit to be told, then I'm a tell it
Better believe that

I go hard fo my money
Anything to get me paid
Go hard foe my money
I'm a go and get it man
I go hard foe my money
I'm a grind all night
Hard; I go hard [x2]


We not only tryin to eat partna, we try'na feast
A nigga get violent if you tryin' to deny me my peace
After decease you be the first to meet the Smith 'n' Wesson
When I'm feelin' hellish, and rebellin'
Boy I split ya melon
Cash rules everything around me-cream! Get the money
If ya gotta put the beam on 'em- plug 'em (Fuck 'em)
Record executives take heed to this early warnin'
You play with the paper,  betta believe we puttin' the hurtin' on ya
Droppin' the curtain on ya- your future is certain murda
Killa, killa, killa, killa
Murda, murda, murda!
Try'na make millions is my mission let's confirm it here
And I hate to break up ya shine, but it's my turn to live
If ya'll ain't talkin' about no money, nigga don't even speak
Pay me for conversation baby, cause my shit ain't free-style
Hell, you lay some paper on the table I'm a flow with' it
If there's scrilla to be collected then I'm a sure get it

I go hard fo my money
Anything to get me paid
Go hard foe my money
I'm a go and get it man
I go hard foe my money
I'm a grind all night
Hard; I go hard [x2]
