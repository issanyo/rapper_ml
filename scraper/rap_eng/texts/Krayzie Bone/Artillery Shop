[Intro]

Psst psst, buddy boy, hey

[Hook]
Nine millimeter Heaters pump pump the dum dum (x4)

[Verse 1]
You need a weapon for protection, hit your nigga for sure
Whether you got beef, or you wanna lick you some niggas to get you some dough
Whatever you need I got
Nine millimeter Glocks fresh outta the package
But if you really wanna do some damage
Check out this Tec-9 automatic
Say you got beef with niggas and there's about 20 of them, don't even sweat it
Pop the clip in that bitch and I bet you there be no more niggas, you can forget it
I got AK-47s and Mac 11s
I bet you a .357 will leave them breathless on a stretcher
I got M16s, my nigga what you need
Believe I got just say what it is and I'll take you to peek, come follow me
Take a look at the Mossberg pump, really fuck niggas up
You can take a leg off with that motherfucker or bust up the gut
Or AK-74, spit it and tear a big hole
Hit whatever you spitting at
Get a gat but hurry nigga I must go
I got some hot shit, some shit you better not get caught with them though
You ditch that bitch right in the river with that nigga you smoked

[Skit]
[Krayzie] What's up my nigga? what you need?

[Krayzie] Hell yeah, nigga wait right here let me go to the back
And I'll be back with some shit for you to kill all them motherfuckers goddamn it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man I got rockets that's launching like heat seekers, street sweepers
That's what you be needing if you trying to make them go meet that Grim Reaper
But when they come heavily heated, we hit them up with a bazooka, spit them off
You wanna get rid of the enemy quickly before they shoot you, nigga what
So check it out I got .22s, .25s, .44s, .45s, and Trey 8 Specials
With them I throw in some extra slugs or maybe a body bag
Or how about a vest, cover your chest up
You gonna be sorry if somebody wet you
I got silencers for quiet murders
Quick and violent murders
I throw in some duct tape if you thinking that you want to rob them first
But lets get back to artillery
I got everything you will ever need
This Mac-10 could sack 10 niggas so quick you'd never believe
Make a gang retreat, stain them niggas, bang the heat
Riot Pump, try it once and nigga you'll come back thanking me
For snipers I got scopes and infrared beams
Hit them where it bleeds, pierce them where they breathe
Better protect yourself, be careful don't wet yourself
Get yourself a gun (gun gun, go get your gun)
So call me if you want some
I got them you can buy some
Don't get caught without it
Believe me nigga I got one
