[Intro/Hook: Krayzie Bone]
Dead dead dead
Kill kill kill em all
Kill kill kill em all (leave em lyircally)
Dead dead dead dead (x3)
(Kill em all repeats while next line is playing)
Die die die, die, die, die, die, die

(Get em!)

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
When I hit em with the rhythm nigga chill em to the bone
I kill em with a lyric and them niggas gettin gone
I can never finish a song
Because the competition never hold on that long
Flow faster than the minutes go on my phone
He wicked lyrical criminals, I'm on my own
The sickest individual
Ya'll might know I'm
I blow a niggas mouth out
All I show em, is I'm a monster, beast
Runnin through like the Nephalim
And I'm fuckin up the rest'a them
Okay nigga, let's pretend that you a bullet proof vest, and I'm an automatic weapon then
And that chest you call yourself protectin is your title
But when I'm releasing this heat, it's vital, ya die
Goin against me is suicidal
Kray psycho like Michael
*Hee hee*
Comin back like I just sold a sack on the 99
Drive by and I kill em with words, bloody, a mess all over the curb
Murda mo some mo, hit em hard, get em all, kill em all
Hit the nigga in the heart for having a thought, then hit I'm in the brain for thinkin he can hang

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]
Perfect execution, last assassination
Murda mo, murda mo, murda mo, murda
(Killa, killa)

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I told ya'll I was about to get it crackin, keepin the blaze, can't fade Krayzie Jackson
Creep with the AK
Straight aimed exactly
Enter the brain
Bang bang bang stained with platinum
A magnum for hit records, trek a nigga like mandom
Blitz headache
No floss, so believe that'cha seen whut'cha saw
So raw, make ya broad wanna get naked
Cause I spit that fire, dawg, hot heat ta burn ya
Had to take a little bitta me ta learn ya
If anybody really got beef than stroll up
And sho'fun they gonn' get broke n rolled up
Get smoked and folded up
I'm kinda like a 4-4 just load me up
(yeah) But when I bust I'm like a AK-47
Under the dust is what the muthafuckas reppin, check em
And ask em how they got there
Leathaface let the sawed off pop, yeah, and make sure all the bullshit stop there
Cause 20 of em verses me still is not fair
Just not fair

And always strong to the finish, never seen a nigga so I'll that's so wicked
None like me before
Nigga feel like you iller than this then come get it

Perfect execution, last assassination
Murda mo, murda mo, murda mo, murda
(Krays a killa, killa) x4

Dead dead dead
Kill kill kill em all
Kill kill kill em all (leave em lyrically)
Dead dead dead dead x3
Die die die, die, die, die, die, die
