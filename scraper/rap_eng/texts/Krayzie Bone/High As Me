[Intro: Krayzie Bone]
They claim that they get high but see, I doubt if they can go higher than me
They claim that they get high let's see, I doubt if they can go higher than me

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
I've never been this high before, levitate rise off the floor
Elevate, get high some more, drift with the wind to the sky I soar
Like a bird, like a bird
I feel like I'm floatin' through fantasy island in the brain, up in the plane lost
My vision, is simply not in good condition, did I mention
We go hard, and we don't even leave home at all
So what a nigga doin', we ball, ball, so carry on
The Mary and the Molly clearly got me very cloudy
So I sit back with my mind in the zone, mindin' my own
Need nobody, I can get high on my own
You're on the late flight,my flight is already gone
I'm in the sky you ain't even left home
I black out my mind and I feel free to be, whoever the hell I may wanna be...

[Chorus: Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see (so I can see)
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see...

[Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you get real high
You smoke this half a pound and your brain gona' fry
And it ain't no lie
Ghost sittin' low and my bitch real high
And it ain't no lie...

[Ya Boy]
Look up in the sky it's a bird, it's a plane
Half a pound of herb to the brain
On a highway in the sky, I swear to God I might swerve in the lane
I'm high and that won't change, smoke that bomb Saddam Hussein
Bitch meet me on that cloud, go ahead and climb that crane
Who the flyest of em' all?
Who the highest of em' all?
They call me Rich Rocka, I grab a pile of hundreds in case I fall
Might find me in a Lamborghini, with a light skin bitch in a tan bikini
Got my mind in a whole another world trying to jump up on tryna' trampoline me
I'm smokin' the ganja green leaf, so high can't no one see me
Nigga I can fuck any bitch, we gon' skinny dip and smoke some seaweed
I'm high like Krayzie Bone
You understand?, okay we gone
Get high, don't say we don't
Pay the dopeman, I don't pay these hoes
She still wanna' try me though
Wanna know what kinda' high we on
That's a hybrid I'm highly on
I'm bout to hit it like a xylophone
I'm like E.T.- (phone home)
Eyes tight - (Hong Kong)
She lickin' on me - (snow cone)
I'm outta' here (so long)...

[Chorus: Ray J]

[Bridge: Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me
I wanna smoke with you so I can see...(x2)

[Ray J]
I heard you claimin' you get real big
I'm about a dollar, what the fuck's fifty percent
I ain't into goin' half, I'm payin' the whole rent
Whole crib hot boxed like there ain't no vent...

[Outro: Krayzie Bone]
They claim that they get high but see, I doubt if they can go higher than me
They claim that they get high let's see, I doubt if they can go higher than me

Get high, get high, get high,get high, get high (x2)
