(Uh-huh, uh uh uh)
Whatcha gon' do, whatcha gon' do
When they come for you, come for you, huh?
Whatcha gon' do, whatcha gon' do
When they come for you, come for you, what?

[TQ]
1 - No, ain't nowhere to run
And no, ain't nowhere to hide
When the heat is on, ain't nothin' you can do
Close your eyes and ride, and hope you get away

[TQ]
People always talk about my lifestyle
Tell me nothin' good could come of it
But I always used to figure it was worth my while
That's why I had to hit this lick
11:30, a 6-4, ridin' dirty
I got the goods, but I think they heard me
Lord help me, can I get away?
Stashin' stuff away
Cuz the boys are comin' to get me
All my pitbulls say...

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Krayzie]
Now tell me whatcha gonna do (buck buck)
When they come for you
When the murderers hit the curve, and suddenly red rum
I gotta respect, refuse to be the dead one
Will it be this bustin' ass ?
Got on vests but we duck, gotta protect our head
It ain't no tellin' when niggas start actin' stupid
'Til they roll up on your block, wit Glocks
Scheme ass could start shootin'
You wanna know what I'm doin'?
Keepin' a weapon at all times
Cuz shit, the broke niggas ain't got, they runnin' up lookin' around
And I think they really want it
But who wanna come to get it?
Wanna pay that unexpected visit to my crib for the riches
I tell 'em to bring it on
A nigga done worked to hard for this shit
Plus I'm a man and a captain goin' down wit his ship
Let's do this, AK 47 spittin' it
When the situation get heated, we gon' be there
With the proper tools and equipment, never be slippin'
Ask me what I'm gon' do when the ? get to jumpin'
And gotta fight 'til it's over
If I don't make it, then I'll go down like a soldier

[TQ]
Let me hear you say, no...

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[TQ]
What you gonna do when they come for you?
Even if they catch me homie, I gotta say somethin'
I won't live another day, and have nothin'
Just believe that I'll be back around in a year or two
Catch me if you can baby
I got a plan baby
Got to get away
Let me hear you say...

[Jermaine Dupri]
Whatcha gon' do, whatcha gon' do
When they come for you, come for you, huh?
Whatcha gon' do, whatcha gon' do
When they come for you, come for you, what?

Whatcha gon' do, whatcha gon' do
When they come for you, come for you, huh?
Whatcha gon' do, whatcha gon' do
When they come for you, come for you, what?

[TQ]
All my people say....
