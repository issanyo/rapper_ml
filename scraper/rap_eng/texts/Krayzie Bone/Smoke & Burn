[Chorus 1 - Up in Clouds] (Krayzie Bone) [Up in Clouds]
And burn
Cause you want to smoke and burn
(Lost in the smoke of mighty reefer) [Beauty surrounds me]
Do what you want to smoke and burn
(Lost in the smoke of mighty reefer) [Beauty surrounds me]
I said you got to smoke and burn
(Lost in the smoke of mighty reefer) [Beauty]
Off chronic ganja
(Lost in the smoke lost in the smoke)
I've got to get higher higher
(Roll it up, light it up, take a puff)

[Verse 1 - Up in Clouds] (Krayzie Bone)
I'll share with you my herb I'm about to choke, off ganja
(Keep on smoking smoking smoking)
So if you want to come along we can load a double hit for my water bong
To get higher higher
(Yeah don't let that buddah fool ya)

[Chorus 2 - Up in Clouds] (Krayzie Bone) [Up in Clouds]
Smoke and burn
Cause you want to smoke and burn
(Lost in the smoke of mighty reefer) [Beauty surrounds me]
Do what you want to smoke and burn
(Lost in the smoke of mighty reefer) [Beauty surrounds me]
I said you got to smoke and burn
(Lost in the smoke of mighty reefer) [Beauty]
Off chronic ganja
(Lost in the smoke lost in the smoke)
I've got to get higher higher
(Keep on smoking smoking smoking)

[Verse 2 - Up in Clouds] (Krayzie Bone)
Quarter past one and it'll all be gone twenty four to the fifth
(Why do I stay high?)
It's 1999 it's time
To open your eyes and arise
See there's hope from above
(Why do I stay high?)
Don't stop because they ask you to be civilized
It's your freedom of speech and a right to be free
(Why do I stay high?)
Peace! Going out to Bob Marley, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
(Why do I stay high?)
2Pac, Eazy, Biggie Biggie, everybody
(So high so high)

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3 - Up in Clouds] (Krayzie Bone) [Up in Clouds]
[Heavenly hosts and angels above]
Roll smoke toke choke pull out some indo
(I say I can take you higher)
[Birds a flight and singing of love]
Roll smoke toke choke we can all go and get smoke
(All we need is weed and fire)
[When you stay high]
But if you really want to ride... with me
(And you know we got some got some)
Y'all can go and try... to see
(You should come and smoke some smoke some)
That it's okay, that it's all right
(Ain't nothing wrong)
If you got to get get high
(Stay high)

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 4 - Up in Clouds] (Krayzie Bone)
(Roll it up roll it up roll it up)
I've got to get away for a while to ease my head (Got to get away)
Toke another blunt to get blunted (P-O-Ded)
Already high (P-O-Ded)
I've got to get away for a while to ease my mind (Got to get away)
Toke another blunt to get blunted (P-O-Ded)
Feeling blind (P-O-Ded)
I feel so lonely (We can erase that from your mind)
And empty ever since he left me (Set yourself free and just get high)
So I just toke, 'til I choke, c'mon roll roll let's get stoned
(Sit back and let your mind just flow)For a while
They'll say I'll run from my problems (Keep running keep running)
And I'm hiding from my head (Keep running keep running)
(The higher I get the further I get away) Acting crazy
Well it may be I tell it wrong, but it's the story told
How I've gotten higher higher higher (lifted lifted)
I've gotten higher higher higher (drifted drifted)
I've gotten so high off ganja (listen listen we've got to got to)

Smoke and burn
Cause you want to smoke and burn
(Lost in the smoke of mighty reefer) [Beauty surrounds me]
Do what you want to smoke and burn
(Lost in the smoke of mighty reefer) [Beauty surrounds me]
I said you got to smoke and burn
(Lost in the smoke, lost in the smoke) [Beauty]
