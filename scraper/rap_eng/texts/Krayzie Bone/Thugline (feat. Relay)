Krayzie
Still thuggin' with the thugs, thugs, with the thugs
(If y'all feel this, scream mo! All my niggas on the Thugline, thugline)
Ain't a damn thing changed, damn thing changed, changed
(If y'all feel this, scream mo! All my niggas on the Thugline, thugline)
And if you niggas wanna get some, get some. Count me down for your thing
Relay
Muthaf**k you niggas hatin' on me, hatin' on me/ No-no, gotta grin but I pin
Swolled eyes so f**k them crooked, crackin'
Po-po's/ Kick down doors on our goals, don't forget them bowls/ Keep businesss
To myself 'cause it's best if no one knows
I trust no hoes and trust no nigga, niggas either/ Try to take my weed, I got
More power than She-ra/ Dirty-South diva
I rise like Mya/ My high is comin' down/ I smoke some more and I get higher/ La
La-la...They beat this weed and they set fire
Ganja make me loose, 'cause I'm live like a wire/ I never share attire, keep
Passin' me them thangs/ Just hit 'em with that heat to
They mouth like some wangs/ Straight out Decator, gon' get some cheese and f**k
The fame/ Straight out Decator, you got
Drama? You know my name/ Now close your eyes and listen to Sleepy rhyme/ You got
Five, I got 5/ Let's go get a dime
Relay
A-T-L, I got to do somethin' to get my point heard/ I put my pen down and let
The folks hear my words/ Don't call me no
Joker, don't call me no nerd cux I be goin' deeper than the others you heard/
'cause this ain't in your head, bumpin' in your
Head knockin'/ I keep the brothers jockin' even though they guns be knockin'/
Gonna block it, throw my hands up
And we dip it up and brawl/ Talkin' all that nonsense, not bein' heard by me at
All/ Nigga in y'all drawers, I rise but my name's not Mya
And I's a tight female/ Don't need smoke to get you higher/ I'm beggin' for
Attention, well I beg to differ
They nervous when I'm lurkin' and your body be stiffer/ I plot by myself, my
Thoughts are dangerous
You gotta be lyrically tight if you wanna hang with us/ Can't sit on my ass
When I know I must be heard
My pen's been put down and now my mouth has been heard
-Refrain-
So you can bring anything you want to/ We do, do this however, whenever you want
To/ But we can act the fool
If that's what you wan do 'cause real niggas on the thugline, thugline, thugline
Relay
Yeah, Little Miss on passion stabbin', nabbin' niggas/ I know how to react and
Be the one who peepin' out them playa haters in the back /And I'm attackin'
Saggin'/ Yes, and I'm relaxin' when I'm high/ Krayzie Bone and Relay done hooked
Up this shit
'cause my, my, my, Relay is comin' round the corner/ Better run for cover or you're
Gonna be a goner/ I told you nigga, we doin' this shit to get richer quicker
Not pullin' triggers, hypnotizin' niggas like, rest in peace, Notorious BIG
Nigga
Relay
Tell me somethin' about any rapper, and in a heartbeat, I would snappin' the
Baddest when I rhyme/ And Relay up to no good
Fact, you should value this beat/ And in this rap game it seems ain't no other 4
Be'cause we'll straight out bust out the scene
Straight out Decator where it's greater/ And it can't get no better, unless you
Headed throu downtown/ The land to go make
Some chedder/ In everyway and everyday, you hear these thugs bust a rap, or
Rhyme, or flow, or just whatever you may call
We gon' snap, snap
Relay
We in the A-T-L, done hooked up/ This shit is buck, so nigga, what? Krayzie
Gotta bust, Krayzie gotta bust, Krayzie gotta
Bust, Krayzie gotta bust {repeated}
Krayzie
Now you know we can get high, high, high, so high/ That's my man, Mister
Sawed-Off Leatherface: the name
Thug is what I claim/ Stayin' away from all these lames and these playa hatas
Steady inflictin' pressure on the brain
But my mentality can't be faded, I play it so f**kin' smooth/ I got my mind just
Like chess, I concentrate on every move
And every rule that they wrote, we break 'em/ Believe me, that's why so many
Niggas fall off for flossin' and goin' against they boss, man/ Too many chiefs
Annoy me, uh/ So when I roll, I'm mostly solo and I know that fo-fo stay mighty
Close
Just touch on my door ho, you'll be greeted by heaters, millimeters
Pop-pop-pop-pop/ Mo! Thug mothership presents;
Thugline niggas, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony still live niggas/ And I got my troopers
Suited and ready/ Relay, up in this muthaf**ka
Marchin', marchin', marchin', marchin/ Bombin' on bitches/ People be sayin', and
If you think we playin; run up and take your chance to die/ It's in your hands
Blow for blow/ We let these muthaf**kers know/ They know whether they male or
Female
I don't roll with no ho
