Let's start this shit up baby

[Krayzie]
Niggas guessin it is my thug nature (thug nature)
That motivates me to chase me some paper (paper)
Cause being broke sure enough
Wasn't the plans when we made 'em
Straight up you barely get up off your ass wake up, wake up!
Nigga, how long you think this shit gonna last?
Get up, get up (Thugs!) got to keep your hustle
Got to fight the struggle if ya wanna survive the jungle
You know I'm a thug for life
I'm knowin you already knowin that
Don't need to be showin that
Until it's time to let niggas knowin that that's what I'm doin
(Thugs!) gonna go platinum outta the box
The tracks out, the raps out
And nigga don't act shocked
You fuckin with Kray, Leatherface, Sawed Off Slim
Ghetto Cowboy (boy) whatever you got to say you say it loud, speak up!
(Thugs!) no need for flashin my jewerly to get a broad, hell no
Ain't got no game but nigga my real is raw
You feel me, kill me that's been the discussion of some bustas
I heard (I heard) them motherfuckas tryin to do the Thuggish Ruggish
(Thugs!) bring it on, we about war world war!
Meet us in the streets or bring it to the show
We can rap, bust caps, make 'em know it
While I strangle this bastard with my microphone cord

[Hook]
Da thugs
Who them motherfuckas wanna be like? Da Thugs
Who them niggas feel the thug shit we write? Da Thugs
Tell them motherfuckas who we do it for? Da Thugs
If ya niggas lookin for us playa here we go, Da Thugs
Why the fuck the cops always fuckin with Da Thugs
Fuck the police that's comin straight from Da Thugs
Who your girlfriend left you for? Da Thugs
Who them niggas you scared to approach? Da Thugs

[Krayzie - 2x]
The way they leave ya fine 'til we get there
Nigga you're runnin outta time (runnin outta time)
See you with a cop, cause we be there pint ya!
Thugs on the line, frontline

[Krayzie]
See Krayzie about that (Thugs!) nickels and profit
Keepin my pockets all swollen
Gimme that Bone Luv
As you can see it's no longer Mo Thug
That's your luck, cause it ain't no beefer that my peeps
So why do I hear 'em speakin it different on the streets?
But check it out (thugs!) I'm thru with trippin
That's why I got on my mission and did this
Handled my business, witness your nigga come up on these millions
Really I been in the cut now for quite a while
When I come out, niggas gonna recognize the tighter style
(Thugs!) now watch out this Harmonies speedin up
Heat it up, beat it up, give it up, (?)
Ain't never been down before just so you know
Wait a minute, oh I want you to meet and greet my thug tribe
New and improved, I bring to you the motherfuckin Thugline (Thugs!)
Fuck what you talkin stupid bitch it's what you walk
Can you walk? and my thugs strut
It's daily watch me walk, Da Thugs!
I never really been one to claim no coast
But yo that Cleveland nigga in here for sho'
(In da house!) that I know

[Hook]
Who them niggas stealin t-shirts and khakies? Da Thugs
Who them niggas keep it real when they rappin? Da Thugs
Who they tryin to ban, who? Da Thugs
And who don't give a damn, who? Da Thugs
What you hearin when you turnin on your radio? Da Thugs
Who you seein when you lookin at the video? Da Thugs
Who them niggas smokin blunts non-stop? Da Thugs
Who them niggas escape the block? Da Thugs

[Krayzie]
When you kick it with the thugs, when you smoke a little weed
Call me up you know the thugs always keep it
We got what you need just call me up, yeah
Da Thugs teach the world (whole wide world) to be like
What's up to my nigga Flesh-N-Bone?
Stay strong my nigga
Fuck the law
