[Intro: Mariah Carey (Bone Thugs)]
Don't forget about us
(Bone, bone, bone, bone)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
(I'm never gonna let it go)

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone & (Jermaine Dupri)]
(Y'all know what this is, So So Def)
Why do we make up just to break up?
Wanna be together, but the world tryna take us
In different directions and ain't even tell us the choices, the blessings collected
But hold on, now wait a second, caught up in my recollection
I remember that body you flexing
Baby, me and you was all night sexing
Your boy put it down, didn't he?
You told me you'd never forget
First time that you let me hit, got on top of it and just rode it, rode it
All night long (ha), shoulda been all life long
Me and you cheating, won't right no wrongs
But, with a good memory, we'll stay strong
(Let's go)

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I've met alot of women in my lifetime
I still never met nuttin' like you
So I'm never, said I'm never, given up the pleasure, not ever
I know, you was the only one true to me
I shoulda thugged you so much more
'Cause it shows
Through do everything you do for me, you kept it real with your boy
Believe me, I remember them day-ays, when nothing came between me and you
We be straight up doing our thang (thang)
When you be next to me, we in ecstasy
I'mma love it, I'mma never leave it 'cause that's all we got
Keep me in your memory...

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Bone Thugs)]
And don't forget about late nights, playing in the dark and waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and, I can see it in your eyes
You still want it
So don't forget about us (I'm never gonna let it go)

[Verse 4: Mariah Carey (Jermaine Dupri)]
(MC, holla) Oh they say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know, nothing comes close to what we had, it perseveres (yeah)
That we both can't forget it, how good we used to get it, oh
There's only one me and you (Uh-uh)
And how we used to shine (we used to shine)
No matter what you go through
We are one, that's a fact, that you can't deny
So baby, we just can't let it, the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret it, so don't forget about us...

[Verse 5: Juelz Santana]
(Santana, Dipset, aye-aye)
Let me brush my shoulders off real quick man
Aye Mimi baby, you need me baby?
You know I know how to treat a lady
See a girl like you, need a guy like me
Not a busta like that, sucka like that
Soon as you leave, he gon' want you right back
He don't want you like that (truss)
I want you like that
She like, baby no, she like baby, no
I'm like baby, you know your baby won't leave you in the cold like that
(No...) I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
I treat you like when I was moving bricks, that's serious, baby I'm serious
I ain't talking materialistic
I'm talking serious business
I'm talking about the wish of wishes
Don't you wish you get this (Aye)?
I know you sick, I know you tired
I know you sick of being sick and tired
X him out, count me in you don't need to be with a clown like him

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Bone Thugs)]
And don't forget about late nights, playing in the dark and waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and, I can see it in your eyes
You still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
