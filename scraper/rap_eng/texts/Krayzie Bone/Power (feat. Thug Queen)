(feat. Thug Queen)

(Chorus 1: repeat 4X)
I got the power, power, power!
Power to the people
We the people got the power, let's ride

(Krayzie)
A nigga be humble, but I'm down for mine
Don't give me no static and you and I can be fine
I may be quiet
Believe me I get violent
You ready for war?
Then grab your shit and come up
It's already jumpin' so we can just join in the start buckin'
Fuck the police now let that be the reason
You meet the heater 9-milli cease the breathin'
The Glock shot the cop body rott
Fuck 'em!
Grab this shotgun and cuff 'em
And dump his shit in the river and let it splash
Do the shit smooth boy, don't ever slip ,move
But don't nobody know, but I know that nigga fish food
So if you ready for the po po to die
Then put one hand in the air, the other hand on your nine
And say "Yeah, yeah"
Get you pump, pump, pump, pump, pump...
Now let me hear you say "Yeah, hell yeah"
Get your pump, pump, pump, pump, pump...

(Thug Queen)
God is so passionate and hear the cries of the needy (needy)
Devil is greedy (greedy)
The get ya high (so high)
Before they feed you (feed ya)
Power to the people that wanted to beat you and mistreat you
And at the same time have a smile when they greet you (greet ya)
Could never be equal we are revelation angels (angels)
Change, 'cause no matter how hard you try you can't erase us or replace us
(Erase us or replace us)
Keep your eyes posted high to the sky
It's your life
The fragile prize for movin' the black lives
I'll rise and fall because of god
The tune is playin'
Black women and black men it's not to late late to repent you sins (sins)

(Chorus 2)
You better stop, duck down (down, down)
(Pay attention, listen)
What's that sound?
AK-47 nigga so you better hit the ground
You better, you better stop, duck down, down, down
(Pay attention, listen)
AK-47 nigga so you better hit the ground!

(Krayzie)
I think I got the power that can take over the world, you see?
Look, I'm tryin' to live forever with this destiny
Man, I'm tryin' to start some shit
A nigga deep into this army shit
And if you feel it, you can march with this
We got a million thugs, strong stompin'
I'm ready to pump, pump, pump. pump
And dump the enemies in the trunk, fuck 'em!
Hey, I heard they got plan to try to kill us all
Niggas get the mark of the beast, disturbin' the peace
But at least we know they doin' dirty
I'ma keep a thirty-thirty close so don't worry
We get with the static in a hurry

(Chorus - repeat 4X)
I go the power, power, power!
Power to the people
We the people got the power, lets ride

(Krayzie)
What, what, what would you do, would you do
Would you do if the end of the world came and it was real (real)
And to know that you'll be dyin' soon (soon, soon)
Armageddon's coming for you and for me
Can't you see?(see?)
(x2)
Get your pump, pump, pump, pump, pump...
You can get your pump, pump, pump, pump, pump
Go ahead and get your pump, pump, pump, pump...
(x4)
Power, power
People got the power
We the people got the power, let's ride
Come on
