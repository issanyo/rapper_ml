[Hook]
Yeah they call me, call me
They call me Mr. Look So Good, so good
Put your money on me
I'm a good look, I'm a good look
(Put a million on me and let it ride)
I'm a good look, I'm a good look
Yeah they call me, call me
They call me Mr. Look So Good, so good
Put your money on me
I'm a good look, I'm a good look
(Put a million on me and let it ride)
I'm a good look, I'm a good look

[Verse 1]
If you wanna win, put a million on me
Spend it on me get your banker
I'm making my G's, them niggas asleep
But I don't care if they wake up
I got flavour for you the saviour, then I got styles with many styles
The rhythm, the melody, really the harmony will make 'em get up and get down
The music master, master the music, use it as my backup
So many lyrics that I spit chapters as soon as you hear it you too will be captured
So if you wanna get some, and get your money come and get some

Can't fade me, pay me, blaze me right
They wonder how I tend to stay alive, I do I
Maintain, sustain a Krayzie grind
I play the field so nigga I keep it real, no lie
I tell them just cause I muscle, hustle my ass off
And I turn my ringtone up loud in case the cash calls
When it's time for the boss to get down, a nigga mad dog
Rolling fast past y'all speeding like a fast car, fast car

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If you feel like making money and you need a good investment
Then you need not look no further, I'm your million dollar blessing
I'm moving, execution, I know how they get their leverage
I was dealt some bad cards but ended up with the best hand
No time without them dollar signs
If you ain't talking 'bout no paper could you stay out of mine?
And don't be tryin' test my patience, why they hate on my grind?
But y'all ain't really tryna go to war
Been tryin' find my way and get my legend on, y'all
Securing the foundation, make sure it's never gonna fall
Keep moving, got plenty music, I'm forever gone ball
So go home if you ain't come to go hard
I try to tell them to put on their money on me, the others are amateurs
Really, we helping 'em holding 'em up, supporting them up like we bannisters
So ride the band wagon, tell them to pack that in their canister
Come spend a couple of dollars, let us live ghetto fabulous
