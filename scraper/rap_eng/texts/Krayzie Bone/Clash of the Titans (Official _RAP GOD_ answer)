Laaaaaash of the Titannns
Imma let'em know before it gets too deep, I am the beginning and the end
I am the light, I am the darkness, I am the life, I am the father, I'm the creator
I am the Alpha and the Omega
Lyrical Messiah, Undertaker
So abide by the lord, abide by the lord
Can't nobody ever see the nigga when the nigga is original and touched down first
That means im hanging in just like Earth and I can bring pain to haters like birth
Yall wanna do work?
I'm rippin up out of my shirt when im hearing the blasphemy
When they drop to their knees and they ask for rap to get better, they pray and they ask for me
The almighyyyyyyyyyyy lyrical mastermind
Now that everybody try'na crowd around a nigga style, like a nigga style while they hold the other down
All them really wanna try to run away with the sound, but they can't really go a mile (HEY)
Tell'em they can make it over this way if they really wanna end it on this day
It's they choice, put them to rest with the pitch of the voice (WRAAAH!!!) Monster focus of course
So I see it that they copy me, but all them niggas seem to do it really sloppily
They can really only understand a part of me, they try to get the flow, but they can never get the harmony
Im like a magnet, I keep attracting rappers, its in need of a master kinda like sensei
So let the bow their heads and begin to pray
And as you pray its best you ask to be forgiven, dont be foolish, dont be senseless thinking you can't be the victim, You can die
Tell'em they better respect it and never forget where they got it from
Or we gon' come after them niggas with bloody, mo bloody mo redruM
Murda Mo, Murrrrda Mo
And I dont give a fuck if niggas think im talkin 'bout'em
Cus' them niggas know that I can talk it plus I walk about it
Violent when I bark about it, Imma get the part started
Im the nigga did it while them other niggas thought about it
Everybody know me, niggas know that im all been about it
Never met the person whos the hardest, 'cus im really hard
Try to go the distance, imma take'em just a little farther
Have my competition retreating and  running for the border
Ring the alarms, cus its time to drop bombs, cus all of my rhymes are highly uncommon
All them niggas thinking they grown, but I came and paused in my prime, it's time to pay homage
Look at who they try to be the most, nigga put it down over seas, every coast
Im one of the realest MC's that ever spoke, im really like the bombest weed they ever smoked (DOPE)
Even when I lean with it I, Im clean with it, I am the illest nigga niggas have seen with it, supreme with it
Yall dont really want it cus im in my zone, Originally original cus its my own
Somebody better tell them that them other niggas faking and the really mistaken, nigga that that Bone
Sick of these so called rappers coming with watered down shit, foul shit
Somebody shouldve learned'em all that to never come around this with that clown shit
So I gotta show'em with a little bit of melody, there will never ever be another Thug N Harmony
Everybody do it now and it dont really bother me, cus they already knowing im the leader of the artistry
Real in the streets, I keeps it real in the booth
Yeah and even that 9mm I carry, it still spits the truth
Nigga dont test me, im not an experiment, you curiosity may be innocent
But before you niggas try to run up on me, im an incredible, hell of a lyricist
And its impeccable, they can never deny the sound, its so respectable
Have you heard this scary deadly flow? thats the reason all them other niggas want to catch the Boat (Float on)
I been save you rapper from sinking ever since I came in the game
And it ain't only rappers, it even some singers thats singing like us when they sang
Even producers producing the beat with the double time making that bang
So why in the fuck is they acting like we ain't the reason that everything changed?
Way back in the days when we came from East 99, the beats they deny me
And really I never had to be away, cus they fell asleep on a giant
So I came back and showed'em that I was the chosen one and they should never defy it
Imma rock til the beat stop, imma make'em feel it when the beat drop
You better bring a cold drink cus the heat hot, Nigga yall better think cus we not
But we retaliate and the shit was Kray cus it was really Kray, keep it real what the fuck im supposed  to say?
I fucks with Kanye
I fucks with Jay
I fucks with Lil Wayne
I fucks with Dre *(or Drake?)
I wanna have a minaj, I fucks with Nicki
I wanna rob a couple rappers, I fucks with 50
The flow was out of control, so I fucks with Kendrick
I fucks with Most Def, he fucks with lyrics
I fucks with Eminem
I fucks with T.I
I fucks with 2 Chainz (Hey)
I fucks with Nipsey
I fucks with Jeezy, but not with you Mane (Gucci??)
And im fuckin with A$AP
Remember the matter remains that, I tellem that Leathaface still in this bitch and I stay hitting hard as a train wreck
What a minute, you probably thought I was finished
With me it's never an ending
The killer make sure you stay dead
This killer flow that be the gimmick
The illest of any minute
The realest, so many feel it
The lyrics really authentic
So potent that when you get it, you cough or choke when you hear it
Im knowing them niggas fearing, cus i got up in their spirit
I told them niggas in the beginning that Imma kill'em with 2000 words in 2 minutes (PIN IT)
Who that nigga running with the AK-47 packing pumps like it fit through us and 357
HEAT, so heated heavy that these competitors are never ready
Im like a disease, I keep spreading
I hittem like a headache or a migraine, watch a nigga die in the flames when I set it. (deadly)
Burn them to Hades, ain't non' them met Krayzie, ain't never afraid (WHO SCARED?!)
Rocking like a real rapper, then I put a little Jodeci in it and say"Ooh Yeah!!"
I never wanna be a star, I rather kick it with the real niggas
Chillin with the field niggas
Get that dollar bill nigga
If I got to kill niggas, then you really finna meet this steel nigga
Coming 'round the corner with the gun and you're a goner
Cus im more than a performance, sending rappers to the corner
So I give'em all a warning when you see a nigga stomping, coming at you with an attitude, all you gotta do SALUTE!!
