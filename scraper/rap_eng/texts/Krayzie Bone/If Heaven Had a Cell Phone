[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
If heaven really had a cell phone
I'd pick it up and hit up God and ask Him what's happening
I apologize for all of this madness
Speaking on behalf of all of my family
World so crazy, everybody angry
Thinking you deserted, everybody say you ain't here
I been tryna tell them you be always on the level
World ran by the Devil, I be yelling but they can't hear
Everything mixed up, need to be fixed up
And all the politicians say they got the answers
But every time they vote em' in it didn't matter
Cause then it show em' once again it don't matter
I just wanna let you know before they tryna hold on
I already know you know it even though we may not show it
But can you tell me what am I to do when everybody is pursuing all this wickedness you said we shouldn't do it, do it

[Chorus: Tank]
I wish heaven had a cellphone
Wanna hear your voice, wanna hear your voice
I wish heaven had a cellphone
And what I wouldn't give to hear your voice again
I wish heaven had a cellphone
Wanna hear your voice, wanna hear your voice
I wish heaven had a cellphone
And what I wouldn't give to hear your voice again

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
When I walk through crossroads
Gonna miss everybody, I got my eye on the sparrows
If heaven had a cellphone
I would call up the Eazy like, "How you get in with an L pro? Hell No"
Tell em hey, don't get in the car
My guardian angel, you know we gonna be there in all
There's too many levels to leave a nigga dead in the door
But let em open up another one, that's white and that's pure
If heaven had a cellphone
Take Kray, take Wish, take Flesh, make sure my L go
Been a hell of a road
They gonna 'member the Bone
Until the end of the world
Every verse, know that I get known
Heaven had a cell phone
How many of us will get the dial tone
Will they think it was without forgiving all wrong
Will they give us a chance when giving our songs
If heaven had a cell phone

[Chorus: Tank]
I wish heaven had a cellphone
Wanna hear your voice, wanna hear your voice
I wish heaven had a cellphone
And what I wouldn't give to hear your voice again
I wish heaven had a cellphone
Wanna hear your voice, wanna hear your voice
I wish heaven had a cellphone
And what I wouldn't give to hear your voice again

[Outro: Tank]
Imma call you up to hear you one more time
Imma call you up cause you stay on my mind
Imma call you up cause to see if you alright
If Heaven had a cellphone
