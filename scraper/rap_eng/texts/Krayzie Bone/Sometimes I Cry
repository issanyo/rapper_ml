[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Welcome to hard times, man that's home to me
Matter fact, man, I'm thinking that's what's wrong with me
In a alley by the trash cans looking for help
Ain't nobody breaking bread, I gotta help myself
Walking through this cruel world with a brown paper bag
My youth dying fast and it's hurting me bad
The governator he don't give a fuck
Time ticking on this earth and it's getting rough
Man, got a lotta rules but I ain't got nothing to do with God
[?] -rough where they catch me in the garage
Around stage where I bust a little
Stuck in the struggle so every now and then I cry

[Hook]
Each day I cry, a little
Each night I die, a little
Each day I cry, a little
Each night I die, a little

[Verse 2: Keef G]
(Yeahhh)
So what they hell you gone tell a grown man
Stripping and pimping and plus a player, their own man
(Man)
Now buckle with the spoon, I'ma feed you a long hand
So you can [?] on that ass [?]
(Owww)
