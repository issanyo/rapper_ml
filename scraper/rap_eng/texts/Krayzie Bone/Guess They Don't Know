Chorus
I want to hurt you i don’t know why(4X)
Verse 1
Woke up this morning in a cemetery kinda weary
Looked over my shoulder and I seen somebody just been freshly buried
Was kinda scary cuz my shirt was soaked in blood man
Shovel in my hand so I had to be the one that dug that
But I had no knowledge
I don’t remember even leavin the house man
Can’t explain how I got here
It’s like I was walkin but I was unconscious
But I had to be wallin
Cuz I seen the bloody machete ah
It was used on the victim to shred him up
Oh my god don’t tell me I… Oh shit
Something’s going wrong I don’t know whats going on
All I know was I was home then I woke up here alone
Wondering who was in that hole I ain’t stickin around to know
My mind is blank and I’m so cold and I don’t know which way to go
Runnin in the rain
I’m barely breathin more like wheezin
Runnin in the rain
How could this be what I was heavin
I made it to my house I closed the blinds and shut the door
Somebody please tell me whats going on cuz I don’t fuckin know
Chorus
Verse 2
Jumped in the shower washed the blood from off my body
Rolled up a blunt I’m feeling psychotic mixed me up some ginentonic
But I’m nauseous feeling woozy like I’m in the twilight zone the movie
How did I do it how did I get through it
And I wondered if anyone knew what I was doing
Sat down and clicked on the tube
Flipped to the news I’m trying to find answers
Whos body is on my hands and how did the situation get so drastic
Its madness
And I just can’t take no more I passed out
Couldn’t help but crash out from last night I’m dashed out
Slept for a minute but I didn’t sleep to long before
I was awakin by some heavy bangin on my door
It was the popo cuz inside they shined their flashlights
Gotta funny feeling this has something to do with last night
They tried to tell me that I’m wanted for kidnap and murder
Tellin me they got proof that I murdered my ex-employer
Don’t think my lawyer can help me with this one
I grabbed my pistol put the clip in
And i’m out the back window
I’m gone
