Now when I come home, ya yellin, tellin me ya gone
But I guess your leavin again We been here many times before, come on it's so old
I think it's best I let'cha go roll
Need ta stress ya no more Oh no, I think it would be better if ya leave me now
Stead of repeatin the same old episode
The one ya think I'm cheatin me
Yes I can see that I'm the reason ya greavin
Blowin on this potent weed is really got me thinkin
Maybe it's me that's makin you hate me
Maybe it's me that's drivin you crazy
Maybe it's me n I can't be mad if you replace me
Maybe it's me that's just not ready for relations (ships)
Ooo yeah yeah yeah yeah ya yeah yeah
At home n now I'm all alone
Why do I keep hearin this same sad songs
Remindin me of things I lost
I finally see I had it all
But I didn't realize that I had everything I needed She was all I needed, but I was so damn greedy
So now I'll spend more time doin nothin, gettin weeded My life is so damn speedy
I need to take it easy
Maybe it's me that's makin you hate me
Maybe it's me that's drivin you crazy
Maybe it's me n I can't be mad if you replace me
Maybe it's me that's just not ready for relations (ships)
Ooo yeah yeah yeah yeah ya yeah yeah
Pac say life as a rap star ain't nothin without god
N uh, he not lyin at all
Cause I got problems ya'll
Maybe it's me bein this miserable man that I am
It could be me the one that ain't really givin a damn
Or could it be that the game got me gone, fame got me zoned out
I'm out here in the cold, I'm in the cold I really wish I could change, but I'm caught up in my ways I'm in the fast lane, but I need to take another road
Maybe it's me that's makin you hate me
Maybe it's me that's drivin you crazy
Maybe it's me n I can't be mad if you replace me
Maybe it's me that's just not ready for relations (ships)
Ooo yeah yeah yeah yeah ya yeah yeah
