Krayzie bone....
Grandaddy remix
(Yeah) Got that heater
Blowing on cheeba

Comming from the 9-9
Deep rollin' with my heater
Rolling with a broad named Sheeba
Blowing on cheeba
Keep a little bit of
That leaf chopped up with kief
I got everything you need what you receive
Got 2Pac round my neck so
Y’all i’m cashin' out
Legend
Got BIG sittin on my wrist and
Dog i’m cashin' out
Legend
Got Eazy baning in the deck
When i’m rolling with my heater
Legend
Rolling with a broad named Sheeba
Blowing on cheeba

You’ll better believe that i’m asking
Any rapper wanna see me come and see me
But I tell ‘em niggas straight up dog, dissaster
In the aftermath you never last a blast
Kray taxes, i’m just up in the hummer then have it
But i’m in it and ready to jam it
Watch a nigga wreak havoc
Hell yeah, i’m classic
But I still get in the comments of some asses
Make a nigga dissapear like magic
We can never live a proffesor so acting
Flow massive And I can take ‘em like a beast,so savage
Need glasses,if you really wanna see me pass this
Smoke a nigga like a leaf to the ashes
In the caddi on my grandad status, Im the baddest

Comming from the 9-9
Deep rollin' with my heater
Rolling with a broad named Sheeba
Blowing on cheeba
Keep a little bit of
That leaf chopped up with kief
I got everything you need what you receive
Got 2Pac round my neck so
Y’all i’m cashin' out
Legend
Got BIG sitting on my wrist and
Dog i’m cashin' out
Legend
Got Eazy baning in the deck
When i’m rolling with my heater
Legend
Rolling with a broad named Sheeba
Blowing on cheeba

Look at me now,still doing it, moving it
To prove it to ‘em I got gutter like a sewer
A nigga from the past, but i’m still the future
No matter what I do kray still the truth yeah
They see i’m not the last when I shoot the ruger
Now who gonna be the fool to make a move and lose blood
And I don’t need a bullet, ima lyrically shoot ya
Boo-yah ,doo-yah, critically wound ya
Mentally bruise ya, seriously you know
So nigga you can do whatever trusted looser
How many lessons do I gotta school ya
To make a nigga recognize I'm never the looser
Y’all niggas ain’t ready for this
Y’all niggas ain’t steady for this
Y’all still ain’t learned
The fire get hot, when the fire gets hot, it burns

Comming from the 9-9
Deep rollin' with my heater
Rolling with a broad named Sheeba
Blowing on cheeba
Keep a little bit of
That leaf chopped up with kief
