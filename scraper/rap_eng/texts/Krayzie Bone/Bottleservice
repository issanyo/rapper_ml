It's The Life
Bone Thug

[Chorus]
We just tryna fly through the sky, come lets float
We tryna stay high, rise way higher than most
(X2)

Rise way higher than most
(X4)

[Krayzie Bone]
Step in the party, I'm tryna get me some liquor in me
I got the feeling that I'm finna go over my limit
And never underestimate me cause I got it in me
I know how high I can go
I usually get it started after sundown
Forget about my problems 'til the sunrise
And let me live the life at least one time
I'm like how I high can flow
I got money in the bank
So I can still get high
You keep thankin' what you thank
Cause I'm gon' pop this bottle
You keep drankin' what you drank
I got a little bit of weed though
It's medicated so it's legal
So we can creep, sneak out back
Roll up, blow that sack, sack of fire, fire

[Chorus]
We just tryna fly through the sky, come lets float
We tryna stay high, rise way higher than most
(X2)

Rise way higher than most
(X4)

[Bizzy Bone]
I need me edibles
So I put them on the plane next to my cookies and partied at another show
Another level, crank the radio percenitiles
Pass the dutchie on the left hand, general
Like heavy metalist
Music I bet that woo their mind
These are the signs of times
The wage is when you drop down
It's contagious, the way people who wah down
Now get your mula, It's on mine is to not find
I get to crew up, they stronger than a do not sign
Fried on friday, high on the god damn highway
You don't wanna see me shine
Eyes on my day
My mind my way
Slide your bitches to the side in my flyway
I'm elevating, for levitation
I've been takin' over imitation in my, in my mind

[Chorus]
We just tryna fly through the sky, come lets flow
We tryna stay high, rise way higher than most
(X2)

Rise way higher than most
(X4)
