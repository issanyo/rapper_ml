Wannabe soldier, Souljah, I done told ya

Even though it seems playa haters everywhere
But that's an everyday thang, so I continue to stack my green
I mean that I love it, I'm above it

Mo Thuggish ruggish bandit that'll kill ya, drill ya
[Can't never get passed that]
Nigga, Krayzie Bone, who stays strapped
Be havin' much love for ya, real with y'all
Got faith in God can't go wrong
Gotta hold on, headstrong
Givin' up props to the Double-Glock
Cause the way we kickin' it just won't stop
Mo Thuggin' always makin' shots

[Krayzie Bone]
Everybody hook up with somebody we havin' a party
We here 'til we pass out
Until it be over I'll be up so come on over
We doin' this every day, and it's all day
So, follow me if you wanna feel the love, thug
We havin' a hell of a party
Parlay, parlay, hey this could be another wonderful day
We're here, remain, maintain, ain't changed
Mo Thug it's the same name
If we got the pops, we'll thug the block, baby
Without the shots [the shots]
We can't stop, won't stop

Creep up, won't ya fly for the sky with me?

And you can see it's only real when you ride with me

[Layzie Bone]
Can you feelin' my magic? lettin' you have it
Comin' with the automatic weapon status
All of my thugs is here for your safety
Everybody be glad they have us
Cause we so thuggish-ruggish, and yo we good humble people
On the grind to teach the world to be a thug in harmony
So peaceful
And I know I can reach those
Blowin' this instrumental wide open
Makin' examples out of weak soldiers
Givin' you the real thugsta devotion
Bringin' my city with me, pin me everyday
It's going down in the town I stay
Come around my way
Hear the beat to the thugsta sound
With all of my peoples on their feet
Now, can I get a "Mo, Mo, Mo"
We never come weak, we always strong
That's how we roll

[Ken Dawg]
This jumpin' must a mean the smoke is in the air
Playas from everywhere, stayin' true to the game
Ridin' real as well as prepared
Got my mind focused on this whole Mo Thug staff
How we dip and dap, lay a path and then stay
That's how it be everyday, routine
Playa, grab your green
Make 'em come clean before you hit the scene
You know what I mean
Because it's 'bout the love for it
All the way around Mo Thug puttin' it down
Comin' from the C-Town
Round up your soldiers, 'cause it just don't stop
It's all about Mo Thug all the way to the top
