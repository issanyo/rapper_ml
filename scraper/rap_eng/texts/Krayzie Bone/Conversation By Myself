I'm insane
I'm going crazy
I'm outta my mind
I'm insane
I'm going crazy
I'm outta my mind
I talk to myself
When I'm alone I'm havin' conversations by myself
I talk to myself
When I'm alone I'm havin' conversations by myself

[Krayzie Bone]
Say nigga what's your problem?
Why do you let these niggas rob ya?
Why do you let them undermine ya, dupe ya and blind ya?
Why do you let them get up beside ya smile and connive ya!
Not trying to be funny my nigga
But I think your weakness is your kindness
Cause they don't respect ya man
They use ya then they neglect ya man
Look at ya, dog you're stressin'
You need to get up and check ya head
Saying that you'se a legend
Then why do they treat ya like a peasant?
Like you ain't relevant when your know your flow is prevalent?
WHY WHY WHY?!
All these other niggas getting paid from what you made
They elevate but you seem to stay underpaid
Stuck as a slave
Dont ya want to fly?
Dont ya wonder why they want a piece of your pie?
Always want to keep you high so they can bleed ya dry then leave ya to die!?
You need to get up in your business go handle it
You need to go in demanding it
Till they understand who the man in here!
Don't let em ram ya rear
Sip on a couple of cans of beer
Here whats a matter you scared? Man, nigga get outta my ear!!

I talk to myself
When I'm alone I'm havin' conversations by myself
I talk to myself
When I'm alone I'm havin' conversations by myself
