[Verse 1]
Hold up, roll that dough
Split that swisher, smoke that dro
Pour that liquor, watch that hoe
Keep my pistol cocked and close
What they want? I don't know
Lots of foes, they plot my dough
They plot to slow, I stop, oh no
I pop my chrome up on po-po
Hit the ground, go
I'm the chosen one
Won't stop, impossible
Lots of flow
Bring me lot's of dough
No more obstacles
I suppose
Ya'll think I'm supposed to let ya'll stop my show
Tryna block my dough
Evil keep tryin' to cop my soul
Let em' know it won't be sold

[Chorus]
Still ain't nothin' changed
Bone ain't never changed
We do this everyday
Not for Fame, not for play
This is real life
(X2)

[Verse 2]
A lot niggas hang around but I really don't need em'
Don't need security either, that's why I keep a heater
Ride up on me if you want to
And you gon' see that I'm the wrong dude, fuckin' with the wrong crew
Nigga better ask somebody, what happened to the last somebody
They thought he was gonna rest somebody
Don't make me have to blast somebody
Leave you in a body bag, nothin' bout it
Shotgun got em', drop em'
We ain't worried about it
Nigga better lay on off of my shit
Bitches better stay on off of my dick, for real
Cause Kray ain't soft and I'm lit
Everybody say that they the king of the game
How many niggas can reign at one time?
So stay, they frontline
You niggas all self proclaimed
You suckas so damn lame, don't even get in my lane, lane

[Chorus]
Still ain't nothin' changed
Bone ain't never changed
We do this everyday
Not for Fame, not for play
This is real life
(X2)

[Verse 3]
One verse will leave a nigga dead, so a third verse is overkill
Nigga I'm so for real, so em' my soldier skills
Figured they know the deal
Who the fuck over here? Still at the top!
Nigga got older but I only got better
I done got so cold I write my rhymes in a sweater
Me giving out the throne? negative, that's a never
We rollin' with Bone, run and tell, that's forever
If I gotta hit a nigga, I'ma hit em' cause before I be the victim I'ma make sure they know Krayzie Bone official never artificial
Any nigga got a issue with it, nigga better split it
They can come and get it
Don't no body move don't won't nobody get hurt, hurt
If you be fuckin' with meeeeee
You get murked, murked

[Chorus]
Still ain't nothin' changed
Bone ain't never changed
We do this everyday
Not for Fame, not for play
This is real life
(X2)

[Bridge]
Reeeeeeal what you see
It's all reeeeeeal, It's just the thug in me
Real

[Chorus]
Still ain't nothin' changed
Bone ain't never changed
We do this everyday
Not for Fame, not for play
This is real life
(X2)
