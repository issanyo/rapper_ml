[Chorus]
Thugline, Thugline, come Ride The Thugline
All day (day), keep it real, keep it real, keep it real {4x}
And all night (night), yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bam]
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Wake up in the morning, glorious to see (what?)
Then I hit the streets knowin that I got beef
So since I got beef it make sense to pack the heat
Ain't no debate be (?) publicly
Yeah, I'm a rider call me R-K-C, ambassador, diplomet officially
Ride with my team, the Thugline regime
Evil side regulated, smash, crash, tell me food stamp this game dig us?
Yeah, and tryin to be sneaky
Askin everybody that think I know 'em for my number to beep me
On my pager to beep me
And I sense they negative energy
Feelin like some gangsta, gangsta shit to me
Don't matter where you go it's psycho my flight flown
To the bottoms in Miami got off the plane like Rhinos
Sweaty in this humidity, high
My thugs, hit the club, scene it's crackin tonight
Come on, what, what, said it's crackin tonight
Come on, Thugline make it crack tonight
Yeah huh-uh, huh-uh, come on, come on

[Chorus]
All day (day), keep it real, keep it real, keep it real {4x}
And all night (night), yeah, yeah, yeah
Thugline, Thugline, come Ride The Thugline

[Young Dre]
All night long we ain't goin to sleep
Beat these motherfuckin streets with heats and break beats
Make my way through the door, four rounds bar man
My niggas on one, he snuck a (?) can in
The latest edition to some tight shit is spinnin
Hey DJ, you workin with that equipment
Proceed to stagger through the crowd, blowin one
Ladies in abundance nigga seven to one
Back of the straps, tattoos, holding some Hennessey
I got my partner Krayzie Bone there go one for me
I broke from the camp post tellin baby this and that
She told me about herself she want to model and act
I'm seeing other eyes, but I'm trying to lock this
Who could really blame me about those ass and hips?
She say she got some folks, Young Dre what the deal?
Let's cut this night short take them back up the hill

[Chorus]
Thugline, Thugline, come Ride The Thugline {2x}
All day (day), keep it real, keep it real, keep it real [4x}
And all night (night), yeah, yeah, yeah

[Keef G]
I gets a rush, thinkin bout the fools that we crush
And my little locs is down to bust, and makin a fuss
All up in my pockets they gangsta hatin on us
First round that we (?) now we adding a plus
Live just to die know you know itâ€™s a must
Silly niggas tellin lies, fo' five make 'em hush
Listen, just hear the bullets come when they spittin
Y'all reppin just steppin, I'm only playin to win
Got a pocket full of plenty niggas splurgin on drink
Thirty dollars in the tank a nigga reaking of dank
Khaki suit full of dirt from a nigga puttin in work
Can't understand a command niggas, patrolin to turf
Gotta get it while the water's hot and fill up your pot
Hit the block with a rock with (?) make 'em (?)
I level with a tickety tock, it don't stop
And I'll be damned if they pull a nigga back on the block

[Chorus]
All day (day), keep it real, keep it real, keep it real {4x}
And all night (night), yeah, yeah, yeah
Thugline, Thugline, come Ride The Thugline

[Krayzie Bone]
You might not recognize my flow, cuz it's me bustin at first
Cause I can put styles inside my verses motherfuckers ain't heard yet
But I won't battle MC's, but we do handle beef with these
Competition to me means an enemy (get rid of 'em)
Ask some of these niggas past nothin but snakes in the grass
Talkin bout we bit they mad cause they career was a fag
You might been rappin doin it twistin, but that bullshit you're stressin
Knowin exactly when you're fresh, you niggas wreck shit
Platinum? that ain't a thing for me, hit the studio make it happen
Nigga that's because I'm real with this thug music
We mash and wild in 2000, nigga no remorse
What we be givin?
Heat from the kitchen when fuckin with this shit
Get with the Line, Thugline, the Line, Creepin' On Ah Come Up
You know what?, this time around it's on when we blow up (tell 'em)
Fakers, hate ya, later, y'a'll all die, nigga they all die
They die, they die
