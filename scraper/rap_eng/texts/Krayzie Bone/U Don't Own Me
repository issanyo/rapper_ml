Yeah wassup baby? Before we even get into this
I want you to know one thing, I don't own you
U don't own me, got to keep it like that

U don't own me and I don't own you, let's keep it like that
Cool, we can keep it like that, I like it like that

I heard you tell your boys, she's under control
Butchu got me faded, you must think I'm crazy
You walk around tryin' to play these games
Like you got it goin' on and you're keepin' things strong

I don't understand why you say the things you do
'Cause if you was takin' care of your kids
I wouldn't be thinkin' of someone new, yeah
I know you gave me all the money and new cars
But they won't control me, your love will hold me, yeah

U don't own me and I don't own you, let's keep it like that
Cool, we can keep it like that, I like it like that
