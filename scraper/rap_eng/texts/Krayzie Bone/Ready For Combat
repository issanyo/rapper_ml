Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum (Throughout the whole song)
I bring yo' Thugline (y'all)
Don't they want to see me fall (y'all)
That'll never happen I'm just too raw (y'all)
Used to have a lot of devils here (y'all)
But when against my soul they sing they disappear (y'all)
And now the cryin on the line is perfect time
Tryin' shinnin', keep my mind, ready for combat
