[Intro: Layzie Bone]
Yea, What's happenin'? Bone Thugs~n~Harmony
Fat Joe, Terror Squad, Mo' Thugs
The Good Times nigga, we on top of the world 2x:

[Hook 2x: Krayzie Bone (Layzie Bone)
Good times, good times we can have a good time..
We havin' a big celebration
(We could take some stress off our chest)

[Fat Joe]
Yo, Check my philosophy - Happiness ain't all about monopoly
I put aside the guns & robberies, see good guys copyin' me
The good times is here, rainy days is clear
You wanna go where everybody knows your name like "Cheers"
Where problems is all the same and we got stories to share
Where you don't have to look for joy in a bottle of beer
See what I'm sayin? Stop feelin' sorry for yourself
Besides, those shots of Jack Heed's bad for your health
Understand tough people last, tough times don't
Some get up off they ass, and nigga, some just won't
Take the bad with the good, cuz the good ain't far
This is the stuff dreams are made of - shoot for the stars
The good times

[Hook]

[Bridge: Krayzie Bone:]
Big Celebration, we havin' a big celebration
We havin' a big celebration
Celebration, [bration] celebration, big celebration
Hey we havin' a celebration

[Krayzie Bone]
Havin' a wonderful day
Rememberin' the good times
And the niggas who ain't here for the celebration
We roll up a blunt, and pour out the liquor
Whateva you want, we got it
It's probably in there, plenty reefer
Smoke is blowin' in the wind yeah
Just inhale, exhale...
Feel it whateva your problem is, it won't be one no more
And if you're laid off [Good times]
Sit down and take a load off
You deserve it, fuck what you heard, fuck the world
And let the Buddah soothe ya, ooh ya
Better not let the quicker system "Boo" ya
Krayzie makes the world. I thenk God for my good times
[My good times, my good times]

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh, Now I'm 25, and It's a brand new scene
I'm makin' rap pits straight flossin' on the TV screen
Know wha' I mean, life's sweet to me
In times we used to front, now speak to me
I'm feelin' all right, keepin' them girls happy all night
Baby hold tight, when Joey takes you for a long ride
What was once a dream is now reality
And I'm glad I never listened to haters thet said it'd never be
Remember me? the fat kid from Trinity
Who was once a public enemy is now a loved celebrity
If Joe could do it, It could happen to you
Set goals, and keep your weight up
And good times'll come through. What? [what, what?]
