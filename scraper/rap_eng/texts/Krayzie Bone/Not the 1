Label me a black diamond, I'll be shining like the sun
If you looking for a come up baby, I am not the one (I am not the one)
Yeah, nigga, I am not the one (I am not the one)
Yeah, homie, I am not the one
(X2)

I am not the one for the foolishness
Yes I really do this shit
Nah, I ain't new to this, homie I stay true to this
Believe when I tell ya, shit get thick
Plan, partner, strategize, I'm with my mind on my grip
Two stepping through the bricks with that thing on my hip
I done seen it all twice homie
Life's a trip
Draped and choosed
Got lil mama watching my moves
I'm watching these fools
Turn around they eating your food
I sleep on my toe
Young OG to my foe
Praying for the last nigga that was sleeping on O
Low and behold
We outlaws, roaming the globe
All my verses like scriptures out the holiest scrolls, c'mon

Label me a black diamond, I'll be shining like the sun
If you looking for a come up baby, I am not the one (I am not the one)
Yeah, nigga, I am not the one (I am not the one)
Yeah, homie, I am not the one
(X2)

[Krayzie Bone]
I am not the oooones, for y'all
Bitches can sit back, niggas get back
Get your hand out my mother fuckin pocket
Homie don't kickback, creepin on the come up on me, run up on me
You better be coming for the purpose of murder
Better make sure that your aim is accurate
Cause if you miss, I'm back at yourself
You bitches can stay off the deck
I know the game, lay off the checks
I'm not a lame, bitch I'm, I'm here
One of the realist you ever have heard
I'm not a playa
Pour em the cost
Not here to save ya, oh no, no, no
Still in the major, I gotta go
Don't ask, I can't do shit for ya mane

Never mind your body, body
I want your mind, mind
Have you under my spell and I can have you all the time
(X2)
