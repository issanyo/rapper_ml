I need another motherfucking cigarette, shit, fuck that

Niggas start to riot, it'll never be peace
Would you forgive me lord, (We'll never get freedom) if I killed that man
Nigga bust your gun, nigga motherfuck peace
Would you forgive me lord, (My niggas want freedom) if I killed that man
Niggas start to riot, it'll never be peace
Would you forgive me lord, (Until we get freedom) if I killed that man
Would you forgive me lord, (We'll never get freedom) if I killed that man
Nigga bust your gun, nigga motherfuck peace
The man that tried to run up and rob me blind and nigga for devils intend

Now they say daylight come but me won't go home (I wanna go..I wanna go..wanna go)
Daylight come but me can't go home (I gotta..gotta..gotta..gotta)
I've been living been in this cell for too long (I've been gone way too long)
Daylight come and I just wanna go home
They say daylight come but me won't go home (Daylight..daylight..daylight)
(I wanna go..I wanna go..wanna go)
Daylight come but me can't go home (I gotta..gotta..gotta..gotta)
I've been living been in this cell for too long (I've been gone way too long)
Daylight come and I just wanna go home

[Layzie Bone]
I wanna go home, better yet I think I want to escape
Get me away from all this wickedness that done powdered on my plate
Constate hate, is it my fate
Trying to build off within me, all of these jealousies and envies
Got me watching out for my enemies, weed and Hennessy
Got my mind blurry
And everybody is so when to hurry to tell they crime story
But all the time worry, who get the glory?
When everybody got to perish, is it that money that you cherish?
Or that baby in the carriage, scared to death
Not me never, one of my baby boys is gone
Probably kicking it up in heaven, thugging at the crossroads with Tombstone
You wrong, who wrong
For packing that pipe, Mr. Officer
Got you thinking out your coffin sir
And need me 'cause I'm soft and sir

They say, they say, they say, they say that daylight came so I'm suppose to crack a smile?
But tell me what am I here to live for?
And what am I gonna do now?
Got my whole life on trial
Gave my life is such a risk
Look I got my point, I'm taking my roll
But still I see the mist
Give me about 30 minutes yo, I won't feel a thang
Except my problem changing range, and time appear empty and may (empty and may)
Why does it come to this?
I'm in the orange jumper, pleading a case in front of a judge who won't budge
I'm in the bus, he in the gate

[Krayzie Bone]
The cell doors locked
My heart dropped
Knew it was over
My life known on the outside, does not exist no longer
Caught up in this system, I'm fucked
Took my freedom away, I'm stuck
Man I pace myself night after night
Wondering what in the fuck have I done (Lord what have I done..done)
By the way my name is slim
And I'm here for murder in the first degree
On some niggas who put up and tried to murder me
Self-defense, that ain't how the judge saw it
Said I was a menace because of my prior record and that he was sorry
That he had to do it, but hey
Should I believe if he was sorry, motherfucker wanting to send me away
Thats why I say lets start the riot, nigga motherfuck peace (fuck peace)
Until we get freedom

[Hook]

Let me hear you scream, fuck the police (nigga fuck the police)
Pump your fist and scream, fuck the police (fuck the police)

Pump your fist and scream, fuck the police (fuck the police)
