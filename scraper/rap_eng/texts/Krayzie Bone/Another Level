[Hook]
Somebody tell me please if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find there shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take them to the other side
Somebody tell me please if what I speak is obsolete
How come so many find there shine? I bet they copy me
On another level so I take them to the other side

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
How many times I gotta tell em, I’m slick with the letter
There’s nobody better than I
The game is sick so I come with a medicine vibe
True artists they never can die
I look and they fiending for some of this crazy Jackson
Like I did good dope
Who in the hell say Kray ain't actor?
Better go and ask 'em, niggas in there hood know
Niggas in there hood know me
I’m the lyrical criminal murder the track that's a homicide
Everybody track killer, I'mma ride
So lower the beat if it's down to die
The game, the way that you long for this
And the clones that's FEDing me wrong I guess
With time, look at how strong I get
Been in depth 20 years ain’t burn out yet
But I still get niggas that can't keep up with the flow
With a nigga flow, got 'em on there rose
So I got 'em on a choke hold, lone niggas that's like your popo
And that’s without solo, go low
I hit a nigga then the beef done built
But turned right up in here and got dealt with
Nigga the message: This rap game I'm a ruler
How much a rap I should present?
Vow with a genius in your presence
Style to represent the living legend
Of the crown that never hasn't left me
Cause the town no longer represent me
When I'm dead and gone, my skeleton sit on the throne
Clinching a microphone, destined to shine since I was born
Defines the mind of a wilder storm

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
They told me they wanna hear music
They really ain’t tripping on none of my
Dramas, man
Besides it’s profit to make and dollars to rake and I like Ben franks
Cause I love my music my creative juices run like fluid
Kind of like Nike shoes I just do it
Flow so fluid don’t even take effort to do it
My lesson to students: Never out shine their master
If trill, but don't switch to the path of differ
Different than any rapper
I'm hotter than hell but cold as Alaska
Christ speaks chapters the verse can't hold me no mo'
When I get in to my mornings flow mo'
When the niggas off the road they so slow
Get up in a niggas soul but I'm no ghost
Ride up in them, the rhythm is about their demise
So niggas duck get to splitting and divide
If there a cue in divine they get a sign
Hit them in they mind, get me through the grind
So I muscle the hustle, about them no more problems
In fact when I come through I dodge them
Real laid back nigga I squab them
Whether the brain, Kray is a monster
Don't need a sponsor, I’mma present myself Obama
Yes we can say yes
So sick with it all I can seek is my vicious death
And it ain't no sleeping myself
My illness is contagious, I’m infecting them young like rabies
I’m an epidemic, I’m outrageous
Keep on flipping niggas, I got pages what you wanna do?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Still in the race, I’m maintaining my lead
Call me speedy Gonzales, I come with the speed
Like 'andele, arriba'
The nigga was like concentrate believer
A beast a monster severs the reverends
Competitive spell, and came to do damage
Last man standing, microphone bandit
Niggas can't stand it that's why I brand it
Man its still Bone Thugs and Harmony
And all my fans still feeling for all the BTHUT
And if they feeling let in more though
No less I might get rammers in a porno
You think they get winded, if you want to contend
There's a strip for ten men
When it comes to the pen like oozing
And anybody do it against me don't win
So think about it don't run against me no sin
Looking at the man bitch I wonder where your mob is
Take it as a hint and put him on a wood
Then knock him then work on your flesh like I'm desperate and fresh out the hood
A bastard style nobody had this
In the prison and if I'm the baddest, illest, the maddest
Lyrically certified ain't to many niggas that ain't heard of mine
With the perfect rhyme by the time I can finish is curtain time
I rap but I stay on a dirty grind with my murderous vibe
I'll murk your minds search and find
Reject of a railroad and I fly by like hot metal
Got a million bitches single
So I'm coming fellow, foot on the pedal lets go

[Hook]
