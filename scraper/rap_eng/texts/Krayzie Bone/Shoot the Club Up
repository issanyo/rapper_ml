[Krayzie](x2)
Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck . . 
So if these muthafuckas wanna see your nuts
Show your nuts
Let the slugs bust
Shoot the club up!
These niggas scandalous [scandalous]
Good thing we packin' [packin']

Tonight, we goin' out to the club
We about ten deep.
Everybody looked thugged out
I'm fucked up
Park the car,.
Smoke a little more
We drink a little more
Nigga so high we get the mentality
Fuck everybody
We come here to party
But I know somebody gon' try me
And get my temperature uprisin'
Anyway, nigga, we straight to the V.I.P
Excuse me, we need some Hennessey.
While my niggas is rollin' the sticky,
Pa-pa-pass it, pass it back quickly
That's when I heard the record skip [They fired.]
Security sprayed they mase
Through all the commotion
Some nigga jumped right out the car, right up in my face
Before I could even do somethin', my nigga done rushed him
Took his ass to the floor
Now here comes some more
Now we got a war goin' on
Tryin' to get back out the door
And we got our backs against the wall
Naw, we don't plan to fall, y'all
Cause we did not get searched
We all got pistols in our drawers

[Hook]

[Krayzie]
We heard a shot, shit [shit, shit, shit . . .]:
Them niggas, my niggas--we dropped down to the pavement
Bass from the DJ went blank
Everybody runnin' tryin' to get the fuck up out this place
I pulled out my gun
Like 007--rolled under the table
Unload, reload
Every muthafucka in the club folded up on the floor
Niggas was rootin'-tootin'-shootin'
Security been ran up out the club [Hoes!]
And there ain't nobody left but thugs
We drunk as fuck
Fin to shoot this muthafucka up
Niggas was runnin' up on us
Like they been waitin' for this shit to happen
[What's happenin'?]
For me to get caught in a club riot
But my thugs tight
And I can't believe this shit
Nigga caught up in the middle of a war zone [the war zone]
But nigga, if you know a Bone
Then you know that we get down with the dirty with the chrome
Never leave it home
Put it to your dome
And I let it go
Can't let these niggas run up on me
They bitches
I put another clip in
Unload some more
Keep spittin'
I never can understand:
If security's got the door
Then why so many niggas in here got guns?
And I can testify that cause I just shot one
Good thing nigga packed that vest and my weapon
Cause I'd sure take a strippin'
If a nigga caught me slippin'
Without no protection

[Hook Till End]
