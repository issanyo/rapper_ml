[Intro: Z-Ro]
Damn, we was just riding the other day on how we could come up with this so we can stay down with that. Now we gotta get a suit and tie just to say goodbye. I guess you made it before me, my nigga

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Uh, ya know I miss all of my dawgs, y'all
Like Wishbone miss his Uncle Charles, y'all
Feeling like fuck everybody since we lost y'all
Wonder if God can hear me when I call?
Ya know I miss all of my dawgs, y'all
Like Wishbone miss his Uncle Charles, y'all
Been feeling like fuck the world since we lost y'all
Wonder if God can hear me when I call?

[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Lil' D
When they put you in the ground, it killed me
'Cause I don't even know what was going on
I really wish you would've told a nigga what was really going wrong
'Cause you know I would've been there for ya
Never thought I would be at a candlelight vigil saying a prayer for ya
And it's fucking with my brain
Seem like I gotta smoke a little mo' than I used to just to maintain
These fake ass niggas and these fake as hoes always asking me for money
But you was my lil' brother, you was my nigga, no, you could get anything from me
But I know you up there with my grandmomma now
Make sure you tell your sister and DJ Screw and Big Hawk and my momma, "Hi"

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Uh, ya know I miss all of my dawgs, y'all
Like Wishbone miss his Uncle Charles, y'all
Feeling like fuck everybody since we lost y'all
Wonder if God can hear me when I call?
Ya know I miss all of my dawgs, y'all
Like Wishbone miss his Uncle Charles, y'all
Been feeling like fuck the world since we lost y'all
Wonder if God can hear me when I call?

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Can He hear me when I pray for you? Can anybody pray for me?
And ask the Lord to hold me down
While this thing called death goes around and around
I'm steady tryna dodge that curse
And stay up out the back of that hearse, mane
I done lost so many homies in the struggle
That didn't get to make it through the tunnel
To see the light
I done left so many graveyard trails
Feelin' like we're livin' in the jungle
We pay the price for tryna survive
We dying to stay alive
I'm here wishing you were still here with me
Sipping on some of this Hennessy
But instead we pouring out your portion straight to the curb
Reminisce how we miss your spirit while we blaze up the herbal
Even though it's been years, we still shed tears when we get in the circle
I wanna see you in the resurrection, resurrection, resurrection
You know I'll be there

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Uh, ya know I miss all of my dawgs, y'all
Like Wishbone miss his Uncle Charles, y'all
Feeling like fuck everybody since we lost y'all
Wonder if God can hear me when I call?
Ya know I miss all of my dawgs, y'all
Like Wishbone miss his Uncle Charles, y'all
Been feeling like fuck the world since we lost y'all
Wonder if God can hear me when I call?

[Bridge: Z-Ro]
I know, I know I'll see my homies again
When I make it, meet me at the Pearly Gates and let me in
It'll feel so good to say "How ya doing?" and "How ya been?"
I miss my family and my friends, man
I know, I know I'll see my homies again
When I make it, meet me at the Pearly Gates and let me in
It'll feel so good to say "How ya doing?" and "How ya been?"
I miss my family and my friends, man

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Uh, ya know I miss all of my dawgs, y'all
Like Wishbone miss his Uncle Charles, y'all
Feeling like fuck everybody since we lost y'all
Wonder if God can hear me when I call?
Ya know I miss all of my dawgs, y'all
Like Wishbone miss his Uncle Charles, y'all
Been feeling like fuck the world since we lost y'all
Wonder if God can hear me when I call?
