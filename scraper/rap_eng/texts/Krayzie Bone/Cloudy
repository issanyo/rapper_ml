[Intro:]
Cloudy....

[Verse: 1]
Overcast in my head keep my vision cloudy
Like gloomy weather, got me down, feelin' really drowsy
Even tho the sun is shining all around me
I seem to have a dark cloud, steady raining down on me
I try to shake it, can't escape it, pray for better days
Tryna find a better mindset where it never rains
I can't focus, there is too many obstacles
They say i'm hopeless, I used to pray to god before
But That's before i started hastily, chasing the devil
Living on the edge, fast paced, and raising the treble
Nobody here to help me weather through my bad storms
So my so called friends, i lost the love i've had for em'
So its heavy rain, with a chance of a hurricane
My forever pain runs deeply in my veins
I bleed struggle so i never see the rain
But forgive me if i make the wrong decisions everything's so cloudy

[Hook: 2X]
I guess i'll never see the sunshine, I never get to see the early mornin' sunrise, At night i look up at the sky know that one time, I can see the stars sometimes but the sky so cloudy
Its rainin', its pourin', its rainin', its stormin', its rainin', its pourin', its stormin' its so cloudy

[Verse: 2]
My god its hard to focus when your vision blurry
But my decisions make a scurry, I live in a hurry
Im plenty worried i can lose my soul, if i dont start acting like im supposed to know (better!)
Id say a prayer but i know we prolly fed up(crazy!)
I need a blessing im just giving a heads up
That im weatherin' a bad storm, stand strong, its the last one
And i ain't seen the sunshine, even when being on top of a world it wasn't right, And I've never been comfortable amongst the bright lights, something I'd like, believe me they living quite trife
Sometimes i feel like i might not live past the storm
Seem like its been forever and forever just keeps passing on
I can't escape this bum weather, so its just me and my umbrella ella, ella

[Breakdown:2X]
Why does it rain on me? Why must it rain on me? Why does it rain?

[Hook: 2X]
I guess i'll never see the sunshine, I never get to see the early mornin' sunrise, At night i look up at the sky know that one time, I can see the stars sometimes but the sky so cloudy
Its rainin', its pourin', its rainin', its stormin', its rainin', its pourin', its stormin' its so cloudy

[Outro:]
I can't see clearly, My mind is stolen
I dont want to go outside, cuz it won't stop pourin'
Walkin in the rain, walkin in the rain, walkin in the rain, rain
