Damn man, I see all them mothafuckin police, dogg
Mothafuckaz comin' down here, dogg, fo' real

Krayzie Bone:

(let's get ready for these
Mothafuckaz). These bitches and
Niggas, shit. Let's take they mothafuckin head off, right here
Though, it's on. Aight, nigga i'm tryin to
Load this mothafucka
Damn, nigga, it's comin off. It's on. It's on. What's up? What's
Up, mothafucka (you mothafucka
Fuck you, get up)

Chorus
(gimme some back up) (this way, that way) We no surrender, we no
Pretender, we bang bang (8x)

Jhaz (from II Tru):
We no surrenda, no pretenda, II Tru, my crew come thick
Family behind us, you don't wanna see this Mo Thug clique
Too swift to be faded, just hated by them foes
Throw blows, bow down hoes, Mo Thug handle this like pros

I'm too cold, neva catch me slippin', mothafuck a set up
II Tru to my dyin day, rollin' wit A.J., Mo Thug love, nigga what
You got yo blue suit, yo got yo nine
But if you pop one time, my true's comin' back uptight and I'ma end mines

I'm nothin', but, one ah the best females
Pumpin' in yo ear, fillin' tha air, wit nothin' but potent ass bud smells

Tombstone:
We strapped with Bone hit the deck, on the worst of the wreck
Strapped with the .38 and TEC, hey man how we love them TEC's
Ain't gotta dump 'em, but when we find the muthafuckin' snitch
Lynch 'em, head straight for the ditch

Victims say we got a snake to snitch
Goin' to the cut so we can break the bitch

How you want the nigga, red on on this blue suit, fried
When he died we showed the nigga he could never ride
Or fuck with the souljahs that glide on the Clair side
Runnin' with gauges, flippin' your pages, fuck the cages

Shoulda known not to fuck with the thugs all militant
Hell yeah we chill but we ill to defence of livin'
Still can't help the way we roll, in the land so cold
Eveybody's singin' the devil's song along the road

Boogy Nikke:
I'm takin' the lives of all them seargents, lieutenants we pin this
How far are you willing to go, when you test us we test nuts boy
Better part the sea and pin the scriptures we read 'em
Gotta get 'em where it hurt, gotta get their kids first, now my subject be the envy in me

I'm wantin' your soul to burn in hell, and dwell and tell the past who put you there
Your family was soon to follow, as I complete my intro on your people
God bless the children though, it was business never personal
Better pray to the Lord for your soul, run away through the tunnel of the light, can you see me, see me

Krayzie Bone:
Boy you better believe it, your people f'in' to feel it when the coffin top drop, the box lock shut
Toss 'em in the back of the hearse, and I wish I could watch the cop's crooked body rott
And thugs will all in time takeover the world, collect the minds of all the little girls and boys
And pearls to a another dimension, where really is just us, fuck the system, is ya feelin' me now

'Cause I ain't got time, to be fuckin' with the street weak leakin' mind
You know it's cool to be thuggin' on '99, I parlay break bustas and niggas that's on the grind
Niggas tryin' to creep up on ah come up, but I betcha nigga come my way you sprayed
You knew we was real, we really do smoke blunts, we do all our own stunts, fuck cops a whole bunch

So they wanna die, so we f'in' to kill 'em, hit the copper chop 'em up with the M-11, now feel the pain
We the T-H-U-G be fuckin' souljah, niggas is sure we got the real shit for ya
Never respect 'em ready to blow 'em out ya town now, come on y'all we take a pow pow
That gauge that gauge we spray they lay they lay, what a wonderful day

Get up buck and fuck 'em on up, when they pull you to side and they tryin' to put the cuffs on
That's the perfect time to get it pump, then you reach up in the glove, hold your breath then get ya buss on
Let 'em feel the round, or hear the sound, of the twelve gauge eruption
Destruction we've made, now the peelin' is through and we got your pay

We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
We no surrender, we no pretender, we bang bang
