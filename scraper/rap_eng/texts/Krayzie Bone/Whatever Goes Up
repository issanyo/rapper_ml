Whatever goes up, it must come down, down, down, down
(X2)

[Bizzy Bone]
I've been up and I've been down and I ain't sleepin' on em'
I keep on creepin' on em', creepin' on em', creepin on em'
Oh my bone never divide
Baby this is my third time, turn while, the world marched
Struggle to come up, that's when the family huddles
We live in ghetto's, to make it out the family hustle
My dear beloved, as if you ever love it
We gon' now discover
Still have the Lord above it
Bone Bone, we growin' old
The way we live it but we zone, zone, we gon' move on
I'll be there ready, people always out to getchu
The way your father out to getchu
The haters always out to diss you
So you went to deal with issues
Ain't no helpin hand'll get you
Dead friends, so many tissues, you know I'll miss you
And I'll stay up with you
And problems they keep touching you, wassup with you

[Bizzy Bone]
We've been so high around the world
There and back again
We've seen some messed up things fo sho
Yeah, We've lost some friends
You think you know us but you don't
Cause

[Bizzy & Jonathan Davis]
Whatever goes up, it must come down, down, down, down
(X3)

[Krayzie Bone]
I remember my daddy told me, "Say boy, you need to get up and go get you some"
So I went out and got me some
And when I got it, make sure that I got a lot of it
Cause life you can only live it once
So you need to get it done
Before you know it, they don't know you no more
They never knew ya, you feel just like they treat you like a stranger
Act like they true 'til they can't use you no more
That's how they do ya
Sometimes it really sucks to be famous
I guess everybody gotta take they fall from grace
So just know, that one day, we all fade away
I knew rappers used to be active but they gone today
It's the coldest thang
Nobody loves you when you find out when it's over that you really have more foes than friends
It's a cut throat game, It's a cut throat game
Any second you could be thrown away, blown away

[Bizzy Bone]
We've been so high around the world
There and back again
We've seen some messed up things fo sho
Yeah, We've lost some friends
You think you know us but you don't
Cause

[Bizzy & Jonathan Davis]
Whatever goes up, it must come down, down, down, down
(X3)

No we never gonna ever waste no opportunity
Cause as long as we still standing we'll be family
(X2)

We've been so high around the world
There and back again
We've seen some messed up things fo sho
Yeah, We've lost some friends
You think you know us but you don't
Because

Whatever goes up, it must come down, down, down, down
