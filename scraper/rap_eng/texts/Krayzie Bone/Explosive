[Intro: Krayzie Bone]

Hit em with a sound so explosive (explosive)
I take em under as if I was hypnosis (hypnosis)
The flow picks you up and won’t let ya down
It keeps you up, it won’t let ya down
Explosive, explosive, explosive, explosive
Explosive, explosive, explosive, explosive

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]

With a mystic mind, I come with the wicked and rip the rhyme
The rhythm is leavin em hypnotised
They really been missin the Gemini, feel the vibe, real am I
Unstoppable, takin a loss ain’t optional
Breakin me off ain’t possible, Dominoes!
Reaction, attack em, collapse em, combat em and smash em
Get at em, remind em that its that Thuggish Ruggish madness (madness)
We keepin it real, no matter how they think we soft, we let em know
You bustas tryna really get with Bone, LETS GO

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]

Try to play me like I’m weak
But can’t none of em compete
So get out of my mind (my mind) [MY MIIIND]
They wishin they can catch me sleep
But I stop em and they creep
Back em up with my nine (my nine) [MY NIIINE]
I keep em up off of my feet
Let em prey from underneath
Don’t be wastin my time (my time) [MY TIIIME]
The hustle in me runs deep
Cause you know I’m from the streets
So I stay on my grind

Cause I’m gonna be somebody (hey), I’m somebody (hey), we somebody (hey)
Come on, I’m gonna be somebody (hey), I’m somebody (hey), we somebody (hey)
I’m finna get ready to ride

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]

Look at me grind, I’m still contendin
I’m the attacker while you’re the defendant
You be the victim and I’ll be inflictin ya lyrical PAIN
This bullet’s addictin, give em the fixin
Under The Influence of my invention, injection my intention
P.O.D. is the condition
Reaction, attack em, collapse em, combat em and smash em
Get at em, remind em that its that Thuggish Ruggish madness (madness)
We keepin it real, no matter how they think we soft, we let em know
You bustas tryna really get with Bone, LETS GO

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]

[Bridge: Krayzie Bone]

Hit em with a sound so explosive (explosive)
I take em under as if I was hypnosis (hypnosis)
The flow picks you up and won’t let ya down
It keeps you up, it won’t let ya down
Explosive, explosive, explosive, explosive
Explosive, explosive, explosive, explosive
LETS GO

[Hook: Krayzie Bone]

[Outro: Krayzie Bone]

Yeah, I don’t know what these niggas thought mayne
But this is classic swag
Y’all niggas better recognize, Kray Jack is legendary money

You can’t hold me down, I’m blowin up (blowin up)
You can’t hold me down, I’m blowin up Explosive (2x)
You can’t hold me down, I’m blowin up...
