[Will Smith]
Ladies and gentlemen
Thank you very much for comin out this evening
Yeah, thank you thank you
Please, take the dancefloor, uh
I would like to welcome you, to the Switch, remix
Now all you got to do is let your body move
And just - woo!

[Verse One: Will Smith]
Vibe to vibe a second
This a club girl, why you arrived naked?
Hear that, how the veteran glide the record
But don't download, go out and buy the record
Switch - uhh, somethin sexy 'bout her
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nuttin
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or sum'n
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell "Stop that"
Dance is a hop then a clap, flip it 'round
Now bring it on back, break it down - now switch

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I don't want nobody sittin on the wall
If you didn't come to dance then why'd you come at all
Here's your chance (here's your chance) take my hand (take my hand)
Do that dance, girl, now switch

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
Uh - I got a question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like "Ooh, he a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with e'rybody"
But oh wait, whoa y'all forgettin
When I was, amateur spittin before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Burstin in, passin out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you binge, ring the alarm
Let me see you clap and spin, baby come on - switch!

[Chorus]

[Robin Thicke] + (Will Smith)
I don't want to see you standin
When you look as fine as you (to the left one time girl)
I don't want to see you standin
When you look as fine as you (yo, to the back one time girl)
I don't want to see you standin
When you looks as fine as you (to the right one time girl)
I don't want to see you standin, girl
Look so fine as you (slide it up front, slide it up front)
{left, right, East, West, up, down, North, South} (Robin Thicke)
{left, right, East, West, up, down, North, South} (Big Will, yo)
Look so fine as you babe

[Verse Three: Will Smith]
Keep switchin whether you in your car or your kitchen
Switchin hittin like it's a brand new dancin religion
Chance collision with Robin Thicke advancin my mission
Dance envisioned by my man All Money, keep switchin

[Chorus] - repeat 2X w/ ad libs

[Will Smith]
Ha ha, Big Will
Thank y'all very much for comin out this evenin
The love that I feel, in this room, is beyond, compare
