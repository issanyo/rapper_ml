Woo ah ha

I respect women when I'm on a date
I'll take 'em to the park or maybe the museum
And I only try to kiss 'em if they're ready
Whoo hoo what what what a what a say what what

Help out your mom and dad by gettin' a job
So you can help pay for school supplies
A whoo hoo say ho

Wipe your shoes on the mat when you come in the house
Someone just cleaned that floor
A whoo hoo say what what
Ha ha
