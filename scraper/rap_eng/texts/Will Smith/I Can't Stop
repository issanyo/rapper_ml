Intro: Uhh, Yo, get off me
Get off me

[Hook 1]
I can't stop, da da da da da da da
I can't stop, da da da da da da da
I can't stop, da da da da da da da

[Verse 1]
Get your hands off me
Stop tryin to hold me down
Let me just move around
Girl somethin' done happened to me
Swear to God
Somethin' done snapped in me
I need the whole floor for us
I'm 'bout to bust, mami
And its glorious
I can't seem to stop my feet
You hear my heart beat, digga digga digga digga digga digga
Oh lord, I'mma 'bout to pass out
But when the night is over I'mma be the last out
Sweat pumpin' in my eyes
Vision a blur
But even though my eyes is closed I see visions of her
Un besito mama en be boca
Estoy bien livin' la vida loca
Heart jumpin and pumpin its about to pop
But don't tell me nothin' back up

[Hook 2]
I can't stop, da da da da da da da
I can't stop, da da da da da da da
I can't stop, da da da da da da da

[Verse 2]
The way you press against me
You messin' with me
The way that dress is fittin'
It's got to be forbidden
No reason for security, ma
Feelin' secure
You gaurdin my body, baby
Come on and gimme some more
If all these people wasn't in here, flockin around
And how you in the middle of the floor, baby knockin you down
The dude who be talkin' bout
When I walk in the house cameras like click click click, gizz gizz gizz
A damn shame
How you do the damn thang
Girl you off the damn chain
But you 'bout to be tamed
Look at you
Laughin' and grinnin' and dancin' and spinnin'
It wasn't my intention
But you got me cringin' my linen, come on
Call me a doctor
Give me a respirator
Look into my eyes
Mama, pressure is rapidly rising
All around my naked leg, all around my thigh
Feels like Ecs. when you next to me getting me high
Girl you dancin' honey, that's how I like to play
I be Patrick Swaze, you be Jennifer Gray
High heels stiletto
Sexy straight out the ghetto
She fire
Its like I'm dancin with the devil
Un besito mama en be boca
Estoy bien livin' la vida loca
Heart jumpin and pumpin its about to pop
But don't tell me nothin' back up

[Hook 3]
I can't stop, da da da da da da da
(baby don't hold me back, can't stop, won't stop)
I can't stop, da da da da da da da
(baby don't hold me back, can't stop, don't stop)
I can't stop, da da da da da da da
(baby don't hold me back, won't stop, don't stop)
I can't stop

[Verse 4]
Its like a dream or a TV show or a cinema scene
Brother only dancin' lambada
People treating me mean
Why they be flippin' and trippin' on me
Chasin' me down
Grippin' on me
Racin' around
Disgracin' the sound
Got me on the run
Runnin' for havin fun
They way they come and attack they act like I had a gun
Cops gimme room
Stop tryin' to gimme doom
They got me like roooooooooom
I don't care who it is
I ain't stoppin' for no helicopter
I ain't no fugitive
Bonnie and Clyde alive
Its me and my shortie
Get from in front of me
I don't want to hurt nobody
Un besito mama en be boca
Estoy bien livin' la vida loca
Heart pumpin' and jumpin its about to pop
Suckers don't come no closer, back up

[Hook 4]
I can't stop, da da da da da da da

I can't stop, da da da da da da da
