[Brand New Funk]
Get down, brand new funk, hit it
Get down, brand new funk, hit it
:
It's new, it's out of the ordinary
It's rather extrordinary, so yo bust this commentary
A literary, genius, and a superior beat creator
Have come together, and we made a
Musical composition which we think is a remedy
To cure all the dance floors that's empty
You wanna dance?  We got what you want
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk

A little bit out of control, the monotony
A little bit out of control, the monotony
A little bit out of control, the monotony
A little bit out of control, the monotony
