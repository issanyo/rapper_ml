Big willie
Get on the floor

[Chorusx2]
OH! I'm the Party Starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
& we could dance all night to the early mornin'
OH I'm the Party Starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
& we could dance all night to the early mornin'
Dance, an aphrodisiac
Women gyrating, simulating sensual acts
To stimulating muical tracks
I thought was just gon' com out tonight & get a brew & relax
But no! Uh uh, when you're the party starter
It's like you're on call, yo're what the doctor ordered
It's like you gotta block the borer tothe door
& shock em when it's boring....
GET ON THE FLOOR!!
UH, it's the groovicide bomber, mic in my vest
Tight, strapped to my chest
Like, I'ma run up in the party hollerin'
& be like "Ohhh!", fulfillin' my callin'
Big! (Big), Will!(Will), that's my name, whoop!
Writin' rhymes, that's my game, whoop!
Ask me again and I'll tell yo the same, whoop!
Just write ya number right next to ya name, girl

[Chorusx2]
He was raised in the days when the roof was raised
Every rap occasion, new & amazing
The back of the stage amazed and gazin'
Prayin for the day they would one day praise him
Studied the was of the game & made it
Came trough the maze & the haze & played it perfect
Days any person the road blazin'
Days whn he was low, nothin' could raise him
He came to the show & somehin' uncaged in him
Like the pope, but its party crusade, I'm like braids that's never gon'
Fade ya heard
I'm like, 23's on an Escalade, throw me into the rave
Like you threw a grenade - BOOM!!

[Chorusx2]
I call for the days of the unadulterated
When the artistry was cultivated
You know, back when rap was smart and multilayered
We could rap without&Rs& ulatums damn
Now today I say the phrase I long for the good old days when the party was all about
Partyin'
I was a mini-party starter then
My mind bends when I all my pen
The big queion should I run the mind a vittle
Food for thought or dumb the rhyme a little
But Will "if you come to high that'll alienate folks & they won't buy
It"(yo),trapped in the track
& they be clappin', even when the rappin' is wack
Yo, what happened, when did we get happy wit that?
He's old-fashioned (yup), but let's be happy he's back
Ya heard me!

[Chorusx2]
