Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know he had me scared as hell
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like the weenie and his name is Fred
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway
He's home when I'm awake but he shows up when I sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare on my street
It was a Saturday evening if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and done rushed the movie
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was alright because the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
Buggin' cold havin' a ball
And somethin' about Elm St. was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent you know nuthin' real fancy
About this homeboy named Fred and this girl named Nancy
But word when it was over, I said yo that was def
And everything seemed all right when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare on my street
It was burning in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat and man I was bugging
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted it was so darn hot and I was thirsty
I wanted something cool to quench my thirst
I thought to myself yo this heaters the worst
But when I got downstairs I noticed something was wrong
I was home all alone but the TV was on
I thought nothin' off it as I grabbed the remote
I pushed the power button and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice coming from behind It said
"You got my favorite letter but now you must die"
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke inside my drawers and screamed, "So long, 'cuz"
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screaming
Then thought, "Oh, I get it, I must be dreaming"
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I think that since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
"Here's what we'll do, we gotta lotta work here
Me and you, the souls of your friends you and I will claim
You've got the body and I've got the brain"
I said, "Yo Fred I think you got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long
Look, I'll be honest man this team won't work
The girls won't be on you Fred, your face is all burnt"
Fred got mad and his head started steaming
But I've thought what the hell I'm only dreamin'
I said please leave Fred so I can get some sleep
But give me a call maybe we'll hang out next week
I patted him on the shoulder, said, "Thanks for stopping by"
Then I opened up the door and said, "Take care guy"
He got mad, drew back his arm and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, "Hold up, that hurt"
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, "Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here"
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head and said
"Oh please do something with Fred"
He jumped on my bed, went through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off and then silence
It was a whole new day I thought
"Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway"
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare on my street
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
Come on, come on
Come on Jeff, answer
