[Mary J. Blige]
I always wanted you to be my baby
When you touch me boy you drive me crazy
I don't wanna be your secret lover
When I get you boy there'll be no other
You and me its gotta be (the real thing)
Diamond, gold I'll set you free (my baby)
Wait too long boy I'll be gone (so hurry)
Wanna get this love don't do me wrong
What you find now (I think I love you)
What you feel now (I think I need you)
What you know now (to be real)
I get with you boy on one condition
If you promise not to ever mention
All the things we do to any of your friends
I will promise you love never ends
You and me its gotta be (the real thing)
Diamond, gold I'll set you free (my baby)
Wait too long boy I'll be gone (so hurry)
Wanna get this love don't do me wrong
What you find now (I think I love you)
What you feel now (I think I need you)
What you know now (to be real)

[Will Smith]
I pulled up 2 the front door of your love and I
Knock knocked and you opened up now you
Can't get enough, you was thinking one lil' date
Ate sushi wit ya soul mate
Dead the ice or the SUV's
Our love grows we chose to water the seeds
You the one I've fallen for the more we walk down love's corridor
The angels all applaud (I want ya)
See the look in my eyes don't ya
Like a kid in my whip with Willy Wonka
Like back in the day playin wit Tonka
Gimme ya palm ma lemme read ya fortune
I see trust with hard times and honesty
We gon' go down in history
One look in your face just prove the fact
That you don't have 2 chase what you can attract
Now what's real

[Mary J Blige]
What you find now (I think I love you)
What you feel now (I think I need you)
What you know now (to be real)
What you find now (got to be real)
What you feel now (got to be real)
What you know now (to be real)
What you find now
What you feel now
What you know now (to be real)
