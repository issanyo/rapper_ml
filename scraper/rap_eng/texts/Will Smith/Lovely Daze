It's ten A. M. And I just woke up
Walked to the window and opened the shades up
Sun so bright that I can hardly see
But I'm a black man
So I pass on a tan
Dip to the bathroom take me a shower
But first called up my girl told her be ready in an hour
I was still a bit tired man I'm laggin'
Grabbed the tooth brush to kil the dragon
Ooh have mercy great day in the morning
Turn on the water and I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
Tryin' to get a blender to hot with the cold
Man I'm young but why I feel so old
Get it just right then step to the mirror
Rubbin' my eyes to make my vision get clearer
Everything looks a-o. K
And today is gonna be a lovely day
1 - (a lovely day)
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
So I jet out the crib and hop in the benzo
Today is my girls day and all of my friends go
Just me and her top down on the highway
If you're gonna do it then why not do it the fly way
First a car wash next the barber shop
Then off to my girls crib that's my next stop
A dozen roses a card and candy
I'm a true mackadocious mr. Romanty
She hoped in and she asked where we're goin'
Yo we like a twig in the nile we just flowin'
Maybe to the beach or maybe hook up a picnic
But yo it doesn't matter cause today we just kickin' it
I threw in my homemade slow tape
And off to the beach for some beautiful landscape
Man this is a bonafide lovers delight
Got the ocean on the left the mountains on the right
I said yeah cause that's the way I was feelin'
Free as a bird got the clouds for a ceiling
I wish that I could rest my gas and fly away
Today has been a lovely day
Repeat 1
It's dark outsid
