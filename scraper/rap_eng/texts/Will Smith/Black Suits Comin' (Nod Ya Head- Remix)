Feat. Christina Vidal
[Will Smith]
We come to make it hot for you (woo)

[Christina Vidal] (chorus)
When we get down with the black suits, baby
Just let it loose up in here; go crazy
The way your bouncin' and shakin'
I know you're feelin' me
So get up out ya seat
Come on and nod ya head with me (nod ya head)

When we get down with the black suits, baby
Just let it loose up in here; go crazy (let me see you nod ya head)
The way your bouncin' and shakin'
I know you're feelin' me
So get up out ya seat
Come on and nod ya head with me

[Will Smith]
I am the man in black
I'm back
Breakin' the back of the random attackers
So can the flack
Yo, I'm dangerous
I've been trained to bust
When the strange of us try to endanger us
Praise me me ya'll
Don't nothin' phase me ya'll
When they see me they gaze be all crazy , ya'll
They say I'm a myth
Trust me when if somebody rip
Out of the depths of your imagination so here's Will Smith

Black suit, the black shades
The black shoes, black tie with the black attitude
New style black ray-bans, I'm stunnin' man
New hot in this pitch black 600 man
Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again
Leave you hangin' without bringin' you the fun again
Tanglin' with the alien scum again
Mind your manners or the black suits runnin' in

[Chorus]
(nod ya head!) When we get down with the black suits, baby
Just let it loose up in here; go crazy (let me see you nod ya head)
The way your bouncin' and shakin'
I know you're feelin' me
So get up out ya seat
Come on and nod ya head with me (nod ya head)

When we get down with the black suits, baby
Just let it loose up in here; go crazy (let me see you nod ya head)
The way your bouncin' and shakin'
I know you're feelin' me
So get up out ya seat
Come on and nod ya head with me

Yo check it, yo
It's just check right. Sir Leena (?) makin' me sick right
Earth is worthless to her she be trippin' like
Frettin' that me n' my mens tryin' to get the light
Thinkin' she's superwomen
But black cryptonite
Finishin' whatever you start, son
Best lookin' crime fighter since myself in part one
Better act right, play nice, and sing along
'Cause case is back and he's hype, what?
Bring it on!

We come to make it hot for you (woo)
We come to blow down the block for ya (woo)
Come to crack the street for ya (woo)
Blast the windows out ya Jeep for ya (woo)
We don't wanna hear a peep, baby (woo)
Gotsta recognize the heat, baby (woo)
It's the MIB baby
Got somethin' for all eyes to see, baby

(C-Come on)
(just nod ya head)
When we get down with the black suits, baby
Just let it loose up in here; go crazy (let me see you nod ya head)
The way your bouncin' and shakin'
I know you're feelin' me
So get up out ya seat
Come on and nod ya head with me (Come on!)]

(nod ya head)
When we get down with the black suits, baby

The way your bouncin' and shakin'
I know you're feelin' me
So get up out ya seat
Come on and nod ya head with me

Check it check it
Yo, Case closed. Erase my foes
Chased away by the black suits, shades and clothes
We above the law
Feds can't touch me, ya'll
Highly ranked, black blank ID cards
So disregard what you think you saw
Put that phone down, now
Who you think you callin', huh?
One little flash then... goodnight dear
Just open your eyes, hunny; look right here
Thank you

Mission completed
I mean it we won't be defeated
You seen it we did it
Even with weapons depeleted
Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember
Taking contenders and provin' they only pretenders
Ladies and Gentleman, boys and girls
The Men is Black is back to protect the world
When the enemy is near the elites is here
So have no fear
Just let me see you ..

(nod ya head)
When we get down with the black suits, baby
Just let it loose up in here; go crazy (let me see you nod ya head)
The way your bouncin' and shakin'
I know you're feelin' me
So get up out ya seat
Come on and nod ya head with me (nod ya head)

(come on!)

(Nod ya head)When we get down with the black suits, baby
