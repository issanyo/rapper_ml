[Will Smith]
Intro, the maestro, nice flow
Hot like nitro.. cool as ice though
That type of dichotomy, y'all know it's gotta be
Who else could it be BUT me?
Rub your eyes, behold the Big Williest
Dream supreme beam straight from Philly it's the
Eclectic female attractor
Rapper slash actor, right back at ya
And to the next millenium many come but few are chosen
See me servin like the U.S. Open
Another type of hustler listed at Blockbuster
.. go and ask a movie usher
Who is he? He or she - SFP
Movies, CD's, and TV's, but uh-uh
Cause today I take a break from that
As I roll where a tank of gas'll take me at
I used to rock these red Iroc Z's
Now I rock the MB's with the twelves and V's
Today, sun high.. up in the sky
From N.Y. la la to M.I., just cruisin

[Tichina Arnold]
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin

[Will Smith]
Zero to sixty, flossin - 90 degrees
Sony cartridges, ten CD's each
Reach to the beach, Southside leanin
It ain't often I'm off and I'm feenin for the -
- top down, drop down got me hot now
Heated up can't stop now
What up cutie wop? Sure sure is cookin yo
I know I'm spoken for, can't hurt lookin though
Pop CD's, B-I-G's, then 2Pac's
While cruisin the blocks, hittin the hot spots
Got my celly on O-F-F
Golden Arches got my belly goin oh yes yes
So let's just - ease on down ease on down the road
No pager roll my hip as I'm rollin my whip
Cause today I'm on the solo creep
Man, why you think I be workin so hard all week?
I'm just cruisin

[Tichina Arnold]
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin (I'm just cruisin)
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin

[Will Smith]
Sun settin in the S-K-Y
Must say I've had the best day I'm..
Tryin to find a exit, a place to chill
Not too hectic, so I can spend some time with Will
Let the, sunshine to the moonlight clear my mind
Soul search, see what I find
If I'm bein the best lover and friend
Am I being the best daddy I can?
I pray I am, and I feel good today
Reminisce as I'm cruisin around the way
Roll tight past the park where I used to play
Can't think of a better way to spend my day
Uh, still findin my way, still growin
Petrol blowin, moon soon showin
Gots to get goin, losin the light
And "The Freaks Come Out at Night," right
Just cruisin

Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)

Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin (I'm just cruisin)
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin
