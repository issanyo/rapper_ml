Intro:
We come to make it hot for ya
Woof!

(Chorus)
When you get down with the black suits baby
Just let it loose let that head go crazy
The way we bouncin and shakin I know you feelin me
So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me (Nod ya head)
When you get down with the black suits baby
Just let it loose let that head go crazy (Let me see you nod ya head)
The way we bouncin and shakin I know you feelin me
So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me

(Verse 1)
I am the man in black I'm back
Breaking the back of the random attackers
So can the flak
Yo I'm dangerous
I've been trained to bust
When a stranger fuss try to endanger us
Praise me y'all
Dont nothing faze me y'all
When they see me their gaze be all crazy y'all
They say I'm a myth
Trust me if somebody riff
Out of the depth of your imagination appears Will Smith
Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style black Ray-Bans
I'm stunning man
New hotness pitch black six hundred man
Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again?
Leave you hanging without bringing you the fun again?
Tangling with the alien scum again
Mind ya manners or the black suits running in
Nod Ya Head

(Chorus)
When you get down with the black suits baby
Just let it loose let that head go crazy (Let me see you nod ya head)
The way we bouncin and shakin I know you feelin me
So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me (Nod ya head)
When you get down with the black suits baby
Just let it loose let that head go crazy (Let me see you nod ya head)
The way we bouncin and shakin I know you feelin me
So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me

(Verse 2)
Yo Check it
Yo it's this chick right
Serlena, making me sick right
Earth is worthless to her she be tripping like
Threatening me and my mens
Trying to get the light
Thinking she's superwoman
But black kryptonite finishing whatever you start son
The best looking crime fighter since myself in part one
Better act right and play nice and sing along
Cause Kay is back and he hype - what? Bring it on!
We come to make it hot for ya WOOF!
Come to blow down the block for ya WOOF!
Come to crack the street for ya WOOF!
Blast the windows out ya jeep for ya WOOF!
We don't wanna hear a beat baby WOOF!
Gots to recognize the heat baby WOOF!
It's the MIB baby
Got something for all eyes to see baby
Just nod ya head

(Chorus)
When you get down with the black suits baby
Just let it loose let that head go crazy (Let me see you nod ya head)
The way we bouncin and shakin I know you feelin me
So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me (Nod ya head)
When you get down with the black suits baby
Just let it loose let that head go crazy (Let me see you nod ya head)
The way we bouncin and shakin I know you feelin me
So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me

(Verse 3)
Check it, Check it
Yo, case closed
Erase my foes
Chased away by the black suits, shades, and clothes
We above the law
Feds can't touch me y'all
Highly ranked black blank I.D. card
So disregard what you think you saw
Put that phone down now
Who you think you calling huh?
One little flash then good night there
Just open your eyes honey look right there
Thank you mission completed
I mean it we won't be defeated
You seen it we did it even with weapons depleted
Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember
Taking contenders and proving they only pretenders
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
The Men In Black is back to protect the world
When the enemy is near the elite is here
So have no fear just let me see you
Nod ya head

(Chorus)
When you get down with the black suits baby
Just let it loose let that head go crazy (Let me see you nod ya head)
The way we bouncin and shakin I know you feelin me
So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me (Nod ya head)(Come on)
When you get down with the black suits baby
Just let it loose let that head go crazy (Let me see you nod ya head)
The way we bouncin and shakin I know you feelin me
So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me
Come on

We come to make it hot for ya WOOF!
Come to blow down the block for ya WOOF!
Come to crack the street for ya WOOF!
Blast the windows out ya jeep for ya WOOF!
We don't wanna hear a beat baby WOOF!
Gots to recognize the heat baby WOOF!
It's the MIB baby WOOF!
Got something for all eyes to see baby WOOF!
