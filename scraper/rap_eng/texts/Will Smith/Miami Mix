Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miami, uh, uh
South beach, bringin' the heat, uh
Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that?
Jig it out, uh
Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the base and the sunset glow
Everyday like a Mardi Gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill
Me an Charlie at the bar runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like
(Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races?
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami
Welcome to Miami
Yo, I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin' to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin' out
(Will we loved your last hit?)
So I'm thinkin', I'ma scoot me somethin' hot
In this south-sea meringue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the Caribbean seas, with the hot mommies
Screamin'
(Aii poppy)
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your door, we flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An if you ask how I know I gots ta feed the film
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami
Welcome to Miami
Don't get me wrong, Shytown got it goin' on
An New York is the city that we know don't sleep
An we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mierda, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got 'em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly, Stallone
Miami, my second home
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami
Welcome to Miami
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
