[Will Smith]
I see you wanna dance huh
With your girls and your friends huh

Roll through in the Range and the Benz huh
Wanna jam on the dance floor till it ends huh
Tight buttocks get a lot of attention
I see y'all looking like a Prada convention
Can't stop staring, you're fine as hell
Got my shades on though I ain't playin' myself
Mad dudes with doughs, clock your flows
No X and O's just sexy clothes
Got your dudes with the Lex and the Roves
Striking a pose
But everybody knows you want me

[Eve]
Uh, come on
So you wanna bill papa
I don't buy it, say heart stopper
Cause I move fast in the club
Where you at huh?
Big Willie Style when your dogs play the back
I like the fact that you're so low-key
But play it any lower and you won't know me
Cause I'm out the door for sure approach me
Wave your hand to come over trying to coach me (what?)
Why you in the V-I, E-V-E too fly to drop by
Get up off your clothes and cruise by
Shades high, nothing while you're with bluffing your team
Every time I'm with you blushing, your smile gleam
You don't think I know you noticing me
Come on get closer to be
Be bold take a dose of the Eve
If you're ready for your part
Cause I'm 'bout to depart
I'm your life for the rest of the night
I'm breaking hearts
[Will Smith]
