It's new, it's out of the ordinary
It's rather extrordinary
So yo bust this commentary
A literary, genius, and a superior beat creator
Have come together, and we made a
Musical composition which we think is a remedy
To cure all the dance floors that's empty
You wanna dance? We got what you want
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk
Get down brand new funk-hit it
It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened
One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up
And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut And I dropped my microphone and said
"What the ? Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it"
He just smiled and said, "Yeah def ain't it?"
It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!} And we knew almost at once it was
The {brand new funk}
So we continued to listen to it
And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it
So I gave a hi-five to Jeff and without hesitation popped in my cassette
I took it home that night, and analyzed it
Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it
That Friday, we went to the club And out and out cold tore it up
You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin and spinnin
And clappin, while the beatboxin was groovin and screamin and yellin while on
The microphone I was flowin
Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, "Yo keep goin" So I continued to
Rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox Special assistance from my homeboy Ready
Rock
People barged just to get up front to get a bird's eye view of what we call the
Brand new funk
Ge-Ge-Get down-hit it
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} *
Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the
Beat} Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat with your hands }
Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches * Now get funky with the beat
Jeff starts spinning backwards * Now turn it all around
The most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous remarkable, startling
Sensational, stupendous music
That has ever been created is ours - but believe me it was complicated
But we have done it, so now we can breathe a long awaited sigh of relief
This isn't a publicity stunt It's the raw untouched, pure, hard brand new funk
