Greatness is not this wonderful, esoteric, elusive, god-like feature that only the special among us will ever taste - you know it's something that truly exists in all of us. It's very simple, this is what I believe and I'm willing to die for it. Period.

I want to represent an idea.
I want to represent possibilities.
I want to represent the idea that you really can make what you want,
one of my favourite books is the alchemist - Paulo Coelho
and that's just,
I just believe that,
I believe that I can create whatever I want to create.

The first step, before anybody else in the world believes it
is you have to believe it.
