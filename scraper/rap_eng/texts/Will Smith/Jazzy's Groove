(This is how it goes)

Give me your attention, stop what you're doin and listen up
Because my partner in rhyme is about to tear it up
Jeff, is if someone said that your beats don't excite
And that your cuts were wack, what would you say? (Yeah, right!)
Jeff's about to give an incredible display
And unequivocally prove that he's the best deejay
His name is Jazzy Jeff and he's preparin to shake and make you move
To this long and strong theme song, Jazzy's Groove

And it'll (make em clap to this)
(Make em clap to this)
Hey yo, Jeff
(Come on, yeah)
And it'll (make em clap to this)
And it'll (make em clap to this)
(Come on, yeah)

You know, a lot of deejays, they're just short pieces of statues
My deejay's swift and exciting and coming at you
To other deejays Jeff is just too much
He doesn't use the line switch as a transform crutch
Never missin beats, always on time with the rhyme
You know the scratches are fine when interwined with a bass line
Live in concert, Jeff is never Memorex
You don't believe he's def? Check the flex

[ Jeff cuts up ]
(Don't stop to the rhythm, cause I..)

I could talk forever, but still never explain
Why deejays flee when they hear Jeff's name
Jeff is number one, even though he just begun
Rulin hip-hop as if he was Attila the Hun
We make records, it all adds up a caleidoscope
We work hard, so people can't deny that it's dope
Some music makes you shake, some makes you move
(Now here's what I want y'all to do...)
This beat is dope and it's called Jazzy's Groove

(Come on, yeah)
(Na-na-na-na)
(Come on, yeah)
(Now here's what I want y'all to do)
(Na-na-na-na)

Music has a tendency, a way of makin you feel it
It's been a secret and Jeff is about to reveal it
He'll get you hype, no kiddin, as def as Jeff is
He makes you smile and bow while he's flexin
He's a magician of sorts, it's kind of a sport
Jeff houses the wheels like Michael Jordan the courts
Ask who's the best and people'll say that Jeffrey is
Here's a math lesson, so you can all see how def he is
(1) plus (1) is (2)
(Once again back is the incredible)
And (2) plus (1) is (3)
(The music just turns me on)
And (2) plus (2) is (4)
(Play it on the radio)
And (1) plus (2) is (3
4
Hit it!)

(Breakdown)

Look, it's simple, just admit it
Jeff is the deffest, you wanted a battle, forget it
You're a fool, you're slippin, you're looney, you're crazy
No ifs, no ands if he tests your butt, baby
The music is dope, don't fight it, just give in
Hey yo Jeff, man, tell em why you did it
(I made the beat hype, but still kinda smooth)
And it's dope, right? (For sure) Jazzy's Groove

(It goes 'Oooh' (Oooh)
'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)
It goes 'Oooooh' (Oooooh)
'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)
It goes 'Oooh' (Oooh)
'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)
It'll make you go 'Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh'
(Na-na-na-na)
Here we go
'Oooh' (Oooh)
'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)
It'll make you go 'Ooh' (Ooh)
Na-na-na-na (Na-na-na-na)
Make you go 'Ooh' (Ooh)
Na-na-na-na (Na-na-na-na)
It'll make you go 'Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh'
(Na-na-na-na)
Here we go)
