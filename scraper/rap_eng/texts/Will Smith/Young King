[Hook]
The kings crown
Weighing heavy
On my head
On my head
On my head
I don’t know where I’m headed
But I’m almost there
Almost there
Almost there

[Verse 1]
Young king on his Charlemagne
I see the big picture
Like in back of matinées
Young killa
Anything I Cut will lacerate
Anyone who want it
Heads in a box where your matts lay
An wait for your fam to get it
Whats in the box!?
Like the best scene in Seven
Said Kold
You need to get ya weight up
Nah chill
I just copped a couple packs
I've been waiting on
Skinny nigga damn right but I’m eating
Only bitches I trust wear leashes
Pool full of liquor
Diving off the deep end
On the weekend
Trips to Italy inside the Venetian
Hit the dice
B. Jennings
All I See are 7's
Only box car I roll is a G wagon
Yet I kept it on track
Soul's to this shit
I’m Jessie O. in this bitch
Yea
Known as  a power hitter
Once I hit
Guarantee they be running home quick
Feeling like I’m Sosa
Surrounded by this white
Kicked back like I’m Rosa
Bitches come by the pack like its hoe-sale
Young nigga got bands
Put them flutes in the air
Celebrating since I got here
Yea
Paper flipping
Just like a rolodex
I want the crown
But not only on a Rolex
Fuck around regicide if you own it
We walk around like we soldiers
Arms on our sides quick to pull an fully loaded
Uh
Alone
As I sit in the darkness
Sipping out my solo cup filled with a dark drink
Faded
But still in the picture
My niggas still hungry
On corners still pitchin'
We gotta go get it
I’m gone


[Hook]


[Verse 2]

They watch me
Like a clock on the wrist
Noticed I’m quite a commotion
Oyster perpetual smooth with my motions
Cognac we loose when we mix with the coke in
Too many niggas caught up in emotions
They plotting they scheming while watching my motions
Jordan game 6, at the end I one up them
My art come alive like we at the Smithsonian
Popping like Basquiat, Worhol or Haring
I told you I’m next what you all hard at hearing?
Riding round matt black inside my suburban
Andretti while driving switch lanes while I'm swervin
Can’t you tell I’ve just been working
I’m more than just worth it
Who’d a thought I’d land in such a position
Ask me back then this was not what I pictured
Coast to coast man, I'm well known out my district
I mean y’all tried
Gotta give you credit
You was never winning
Not even  for a second
See its more than getting your cities love
Rather be the hottest in the world, than on the fucking block

[Will Smith]
I want to represent an Idea
I want to represent possibilities
I want to represent the idea that
You really can make what you want
One of my favorite books, is the Alchemist
Paulo Coelho, and Thats Just I Just
Believe that, I believe that
I can create, whatever I want to create
The first step, before anybody else in the world believes it
Is you have to believe it
There's no reason to have a plan B because it distracts from Plan A
