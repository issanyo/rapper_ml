[Verse 1]
Yo, ain't no better man for this hype track
Just the veteran taking the mic back
David Letterman even said he like that track man
Even though he ain't a rap fan
Black radio, they won't play though
Ever since "Summertime" they ain't liked none of mine
Even though the fans went out & bought enough
I guess they think Will ain't hard enough
Maybe I should just have a shoot out
Run up in the bank, bustin', grabbin' all the loot out
Whoop somebody ass, taking my boot out
Right on TV so ya'll can see me
Just ignorant, attacking, actin' rough
I mean, then will I be black enough
Oh wait maybe I'll jack a truck
Full of cigarettes, guns & drugs & stuff

[Chorus (2x)]
Get back
I wish I would of made that
Lean back
I wish I would of made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to 'drop it like it hot'
Summer, Summer, Summertime
Seem like all I got

[Verse 2]
I always envied how ya'll rock wit Dre & the Chronic
The way that 2Pac, Biggie, 50 and Jigga got it
A lot like L.L., Chuck D, Slick & Dougie
I think ya'll love me, but ya'll place other rappers above me
& I don't know if you feel my flow
& be at my show & you'll see where I should go
On the charts of rhyme arts & thoughts in rap form
Damnit, I expanded the platform
Damnit, this Cat's on a rap song
Yeah, it ain't no braids or plats on
Ain't on stage wit no gats on
You know I'm afraid, getting' my act on
It might have stunted my growth
But I wanted them both
& I hope that it would be less tougher
You do two things & then they both gonna suffer
I chose to act & it broke my heart not to rap
Prodigal son, clever, better than ever, back
CHORUS

[Intro - Chorus]
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got, I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back

[Verse 3]
Yo, do you see that lil' bop in my step
Do you see the little drop to the left, huh, yo
Baseball cap, Timbs when I walk
Do you see that lil' grin when I talk, huh, yo
Do you see me sorta glide when I slide
See lean to the side in my ride, huh, yo
Do you see it's no ice on my wrist
Fish still bite just like this. right, right
Do you know what it mean when you see a dude's chick on TV gleamin', huh?
Know what it mean to be on the screen & in the audience "Ali", beamin', yo!
I must have a 'S' on my chest, I recovered from the Wild Wild West, yes!
Yo, I been up the creek without a paddle
Now I'm back on the saddle
I got my swagga back

[Chorus]
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back

[Verse 4]
All you see that you see when you seeing me, you ain't seeing all to be seen
Cause there's more for you to see than when you see me on the scene in my media machine
I mean madness, sickness, sadness, swaggerless back in the day
Fat, ugly chicks in New York on the radio, saying I'm gay
I had a bonafide downside frown with the swagga not around in my life
Bank account found minimal amounts when countin' cause of my now ex-wife
I had to bore thick walls and all that, endure pitfalls and; all that, fallin' callin' for help
With no call back, where was ya'll at, gimme the ball back
I got my swagga back

[Chorus]
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
