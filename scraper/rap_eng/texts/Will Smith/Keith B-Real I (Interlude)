I am Keith B-Real, story breaker, keeping it real
Here I'm in some Chinese mans theater
And this brother is keeping it real damn ridiculous
This is belemptious, we go people up here
Posing as slaves and ice and everything
This is ridiculous, wait a minute
Is that Jada Pinkett?
Excuse me Jada, over here hi
Hey I'm Keith B-Real, keeping it real as usual
I got some questions, I need to ask you girl, sure
How long do you think this Will Smith
Hypothermia is gonna last?
Hypothermia
Yeah, look it up man do you guys read
Well, you know I think will is very talented
And I think he'll be successful at anything he puts his mind too
Well, I been checking out his vertebrae
He don't look like he can slang it like no man
Man, I would tour your little, ah
If you would have read my motivational tapes
You wouldn't have done that it talks
About that on page thirty seven
Uh excuse me, Charlie, Mack, please handle this
Charlie, you need to stop grabbing up on me anyway
This is Keith B Real, be right back
