I-I-I-I woke up this morning
Looked at ya picture
Think about when I'm a get wit'cha
Hit ya on the two-way simply to say I gotta see you today
They say love is a gamble and if so, I'm the Belagio I can't lose
And I guess that make you the mirage
Wait you more exotic than that you like the Taj Mahal momma
You a treasure to me life with you is a pleasure to me
And I'm a make sure no man ever measure to me
Like Run and D you and me are together forever
I got an interview to do (whoo)
Then to the plane, that too (whoo)
Uh wear that black dress boo (whoo)
Then close your eyes and open your heart and I'm a give you

All my love
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
And I just don't wanna stop
Never too much mever too much

[Jada]
Woke up this morning to invite and couldn't wait to write you
I licked your back and then kissed three little kids that look just like you
Love is magic and it's plain and sometimes it just happens
Saw your picture your so silly boy you keep my laughing
We've got a photo shoot can't concentrate my mind is roamin'
Because it's 4 o'clock and at 5:15 you are comin' home and
You know my heart you know my thoughts so ruffneck yet you're tender
The only person ever locked up safe was to surrender

All my love (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
Cause I just don't wanna stop
Never too much mever too much

[Will]
The way you walk wanna make me say
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
[Jada]
The way you let me make you wanna make me say
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
[Will]
Girl the way you look wanna make me say
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
[Jada]
Just so you all wanna make me say
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Will]
Yo yo me and more it's like a Picasso painted your aura
It's like Beehtoven composed your vocal tones
Wrote band inspired hand sculpted you the desire of man (uh)
Michelangelo grieves inside you
Seeds of my wildest dreams fertilized in your eyes
Your compationate and your passion is how you ration it
That makes me swear you was trained how to take me there
Rarely I seen faith be fared
We got a stroke of grace
Remember you was countin me out?
It's crazy we had times of doubt right?
And since the dawn of time written history
Better men better poet than me
Have tried to set verse to the love they knew
Dead to words judge what I do when I give you

A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
And I just don't wanna stop
Never too much mever too much
