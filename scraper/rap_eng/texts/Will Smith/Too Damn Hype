Every Friday night we like to cool at the jams
And if the MC ain't workin, I smack the mic out his hands
If the beat ain't slammin and the deejay ain't def
I snatch the needle up off the record and send somebody to get Jeff
(Ah yeah!) when Jeff comes back with his Technics 12
We slap high fives and start cause it's time to raise hell
Bam is right beside me, people rushin the door
Charlie Mack in the back, [Name] on the dancefloor
Now it's time for us to cold get loose
To show everybody out there that we got juice
Tonight's the night to set what ain't right right
And we'll fight if we gotta, because we're too damn hype

Too Damn Hype

Yes yes y'all, we are the Too Damn Hype
Too Damn Hype, now let's do this right

(Get down)

Too Damn Hype, let me explain what it means
It's the energy that you feel when my posse's on the scene
Well, it's not that we're rowdy, rude, raunchy or loud
But a match into nitro is like my crew into a crowd
I'ma take a minute or maybe I'll take two
To introduce the Too Damn type posse to you
I'ma start the introductions with the man on my left
The undisputed, the greatest alive, my friend and my DJ, he's Jazzy Jeff
On a motorcycle is next [Name]
He's my personal manager, he's the Hammer J.L
And when I got flack, you know he got my back
He punched a hole in the wall all the while he broke a mirror, he's Charlie Mack
Down by law at each and every show
Nicknamed ?Al Diesel? but for short Aldo
And when something goes wrong this is where we go
His favorite line is 'Excuse me, hops', he's [Name] Polo
You met the crew and you know where we live
You met Omar, Money and my man Wiz
The posse is here in full effect tonight
Like gas we'll ignite cause we're Too Damn Hype

Too Damn Hype
Too Damn Hype
Too Damn Hype
Too Damn Hype
Too Damn Hype
Too Damn Hype
Too Damn Hype

Here's where I end off, this is your funky send-off
You say we didn't rock it? There'll be a doom call
Man, my posse is worldwide known
All the way from Philly to the streets of Rome
Too Damn Hype led by Jeff and the Prince
You're spending dollars and cents
We're spending pounds and pence
And yens and rubels and marks, you think I'm playin
Man, my posse is large, get what I'm sayin?
You met the whole crew and you know who I am
And if you wanna be down with us, follow the program
Come to the shows and play this jam every night
That's how you get to be down with the Too Damn Hype
