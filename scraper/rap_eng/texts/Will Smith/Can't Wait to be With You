[Chorus 1 - Christopher Williams] (Fresh Prince)
(I can't wait to be with you, uh)
I can't wait to be with you (yeah)
I can't wait to see you (uh)
I can't wait to be with you (haha)
Loving you is all I want to do

[Verse 1 - Fresh Prince] (Christopher Williams)
10 o'clock my flight lands
Can't wait to hold the palm of your hand
Been 7 long days, since the last that I saw you
And every free moment I get, I got to call you
Takin' every chance, to glance at your cute face
And lookin' at your 8 by 10 in my suitcase
Ain't been with my honey in a long while
And when I get a hold of you, mmm child (oh, yeah)
No tellin' what I might do
Cause I would be like a kid that got a toy and it's brand new
Can't wait to hold you, can't wait to see you
Can't wait to treat you, can't wait to be with you (oh, yeah)

[Chorus 2 - Christopher Williams] (Female voice) [Fresh Prince]
(Can't wait, can't wait) [uh] I can't wait to be with you
(Can't wait, can't wait) {yeah] I can't wait to see you
(Can't wait, can't wait) [uh] I can't wait to be with you [haha]
Loving you is all I want to do

[Verse 2 - Fresh Prince] (Christopher Williams)
Bein' in love is like an amusement ride, G (woo)
I feel like it's a party inside me
Smile on my face, and there's a twinkle in my eye
Time to go to work, but it's so hard to say goodbye (oh, oh)
And as I think of you, it's like I had a drink or two
I feel dizzy, damn where is she?
Pick up the phone and call you about three (Female voice: hello)
Yeah baby it's me, just to hear your voice, just the thought of you
Got me trippin', it's why I just bought a new
Cellular phone, so I don't have to postpone
When my beeper goes off, no more runnin' to a pay phone
Your astoundin', it's why I'm expondin'
So vivacious, and baby your face is
That of a goddess, it's makin' me feel numb
A fe fi fo fum, yo baby come and get some
Of the man, the myth, so debonair
What said while fair, is a pair
We extraordinary, me and you as a team, it's kinda swell ain't it
Love is hole and I tripped, then I feel in it (oh, that's why)
From the mountain, to the valley, to the deep blue sea
All I can do is hope and pray, you want to be with me
I'm sayin' this from my heart, that's how you know that it's true
Yo, I can't wait to be with you

[Chorus 3 - Christopher Williams] (Female voice) [Fresh Prince]
Girl I know it's true
(Can't wait, can't wait), I can't wait to be with you
(Can't wait, can't wait), I can't wait to see you
I can't wait to see you baby [uh]
(Can't wait, can't wait), [uh] I can't wait to be with you
(Can't wait, can't wait), Loving you is all I want to do

[Fresh Prince - talking over Chorus and during Williams' solo singing]
Alright check it out, break
Yeah, uh huh, oh yeah
That's how I like it
That's how I like it
Woof, woof, woof, woof

[Christopher Williams - singing solo]
HEY, OH YEAH, OH WEE, YEAH

[Verse 3 - Fresh Prince] (Christopher Williams)
Yeah, presto chango I wish I was a magacian
Snap my fingers or tap my heels and then
Abra cadabra, righ there beside you
But it's seemin' and dreamin', that's all I can do
I'm in an airport, an hour until flight time
Can't wait to have you direct in my sight line
Got a warm feelin' in my chest, thinkin' of your soft caress
I miss you so much and it ain't enough to just reach out and touch
I want to hold your hand, in my hand
And walk and talk barefoot in the sand
(And I can't wait) to just see your smile
(And I can't wait) to be alone for a while
(And I can't wait) to do the things we do
I can't wait, I can't wait, oh I can't wait to be with you

[Chorus 4] Christopher Williams (female voice) [Fresh Prince]
Oh, can't wait
(Can't wait, can't wait) [uh], I can't wait to be with you
I can't wait to be with you
(Can't wait, can't wait) [yeah], I can't wait to see you
Just to see you
(Can't wait, can't wait) [yeah], I can't wait to be with you
Baby just hold you
Loving you is all I want to do

(Can't wait, can't wait), I can't wait to be with you, can't wait
(Can't wait, can't wait), I can't wait to see you
(Can't wait, can't wait), loving you is all I want to do
