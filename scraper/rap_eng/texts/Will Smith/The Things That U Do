(Intro/Chorus)
It's just the things that you do (5x)The way you do the things you do

(Verse 1)
8:05, the alarm clock sound
I grab my shoe and turn the damn thing down

But now it's 9 o'clock I still ain't up up yet

Work on time, yeah I admire the concept
You got me yearnin' and I'm anticipating
Seeing you I can't wait its hard to concentrate
My mind is blind from all the time, thinking of you
And the way you do things you do

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I walk in the park or a midnight rendevous

A slow dance, romance, my motive is see through

I wanna be with you

But I ain't hiding
A wave of love and I'm gliding and ridening
Things like that when you hear me
Sayin' sort of sounds like that same old clich√©
Climb the highest mountain swimming the deepest sea
But I can't front, I want you to be want me
Cause baby when you grab me tightly
You send chills and tend to excite me
When you caress and fondle me lightly
Oh girl watch up cause she might be
Settin' yourself up the way that you tease me
Sooner or later you might have to please me
It's just something about you
The way you do things you do

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Now why oh why would an incredibly fly guy like me
Be chasing one lady
It's just something about you
The way you carry yourself when you're out you
Seem to have a sort of captivative style, I've parked the feelin'
But your whip is appealing
Since this is a subject that I brought up
I just mind as well admit that I'm caught up
It ain't the clothes you're wearin'
Your perfume or the style that that your hair's in
It ain't your body, how slim your waist is
Your new jeans and how pretty your face is
But I feel funny when it close proximity
Making me wonder what's gettin' in to me
It's just something about you
The way you do the things you do

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
It's nothing that you do (2x)
The way you do the things you do

(Verse 4)
The mysteries of this world I ponder
Just sittin' back let my mind wonder
What the, why the, who the, how the hell is this young lady
Drive me so crazy
Deeply in thought pose like the thinker
I blow you a kiss or a wink
Or a smile just to show you
It's something about you

(feeling kinda odd)
The way you do the things you do
Come here, come here
Come on out, don't worry
You want me to chase you don't you?
Just come here, I've got you now
Sss
The way you do the things you

(Chorus)
It's just the things that you do
(the way you do the things you do) (10x)

(Bridge)
The way (repeated several times)
