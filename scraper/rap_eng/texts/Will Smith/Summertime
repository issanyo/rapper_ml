Summer, summer, summertime
(summertime)
Time to sit back and unwind
(Summertime)

Summer, summer, summertime
(summertime)
Time to sit back and unwind
(Summertime)

Here it is, the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the alpine blast
Pop in my cd and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
(summertime)
Time to sit back and unwind
(Summertime)


Summer, summer, summertime
(summertime)
Time to sit back and unwind
(Summertime)

The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hit you and get you equipped for the summer time


Summer, summer, summertime
(summertime)
Time to sit back and unwind
(Summertime)
