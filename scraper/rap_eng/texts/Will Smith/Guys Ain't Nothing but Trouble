Yo Jazzy what's happening man
Yo Ice Cream Tee is that Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince
Yeah they made that rap tune "Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble"
Those brothers is dead
I don't even like what they said
What are they talking about man
Tell em' again

Listen homegirls let me talk to you
Girls may be trouble but guys are trouble too
Next time a guy try to give you a play
Just turn your head and diss him and walk away
Excuse me Ice Cream Tee
Hello how do you do
Quite fine my darling and how are you
Well I'm doing quite fine but I'm kind of upset
Because I heard a little something I could not forget
What's that? I heard you say that girls are nothing but trouble
And now I'm taking this time to bust your bubble
Your arrogant conceited your stuck on yourself
And bragging nearly every time you open your mouth
You think you'll gets the women success will turn your head
Well I'm sorry to inform you that stuff is dead
Wait a minute let me talk to you
I think I should inform you who you're talking too
No let me tell you so you remember me
As the one that bust your bubble I'm ice cream tee
I'm Jazzy Jeff and I'm the Fresh prince
Before we have you arrested what's the meaning of this
You say girls are full of trouble I must play this to you
Girls may be trouble but guys are trouble too
You're a compulsive liar you mind is full of dirt
All you do is worry about what's up a girls skirt
You can't hurt these people because you got a big mouth
You go run and tell your boys how you made out
I think ruthfully your sick you need to be kicked
See I'm getting my loaded weapon you get on my nerve I go click
Guys think they own their girlfriends
Females aren't possessions we are humans
We like to be wined and dined by candle light
Not being couped up in the house trying to be held up tight
So Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Princedon't mean to bust your bubble
But guys of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So homegirls next time a guy tries to give you the play
Just turn your head and cold diss him and walk away

This amazing hot day I went to see Barney from work
My briefcase in my hand sitting down on my skirt
The undergounds of the surface was the scene of my walk
I got approached from the rear he said "Baby can we talk"
I looked him in the eyes with this fabulous smile
He said "I just got paid lets hang out for a while"
I said first would be my pleasure to know who you are
And do I have to use my tokens or do you have a car
Well my name is the Prince and I'm a great rap star
You don't have to use your tokens I've got a Jaguar
I knew there was no doubt I'd jump on this mission
I proceeded to tell him my name with police suspicion
I said Ice Cream Tee was the title I was given
SWP the name of the hood I live in
So we jumped in the ride hit the 95
We turned into his block pulled up in his drive
First step in the house I saw a mouse
I said ninety in the wrong trips and then with the ow
He came running to my rescue he was a little late
My hair was broke my briefcase was in a totally different place
He said I'm sorry take a sip of this bacardi
And excuse me while I go freshen up for the party
I got a little confused I said party what's up with dude
He didn't even tell me I thought that was quite rude
Suddenly through the door was three men in suits
They said hey sweet mama who are you
I said I'm Ice Cream Tee and who may you be
I'm brother Charles, brother Rick and he's brother Ali
Are you here to see the Prince
Prince no Prince works for me im running the show
Work for me and at 12 o'clock midnight you'll be working 42nd street
Oh my god I was totally stunned
He yanked me up slapped my cheek and put his hands on my buns
I said ha you better watch it sucker
I said to myself I got to go get my geurney
He put me in this locker called me a b e and h
Looked around noticed that there was no escape
Left the room went behind closed doors
I pulled down got my briefcase that was on the floor
Flipped the latch lift the lid pulled out my Smith-n-Wesson
Yes my shiny black loaded 357
Stepped out of the room dressed in shoot of the load
And said they all lay me down and hit me with this tune
When they see my Smith-n-Wesson their eyes got bigger
I relaxed latch off chilled back and pulled the trigger
Picked up the briefcase broke out on the double
These guys of the world are full of trouble

Can't live with 'em can't live without 'em
