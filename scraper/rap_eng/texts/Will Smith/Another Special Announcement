In the place at about this time
My name is the Fresh Prince
And I’m here with my full posse in effect
My man DJ Jazzy Jeff
The Human Jukebox Ready Rock C
James “J.L.” Lassiter
Charlie Mack is in effect
My homeboy Omar Money
Bryan and Pete in the place
We wanna let y’all know our motto for 1988
We are too damn hype—what are we, what are we?
(“We’re too damn hype”) A little louder
(“Too damn hype”) What are we? Come on
