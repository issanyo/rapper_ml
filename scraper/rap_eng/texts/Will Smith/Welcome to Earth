Scene 136: The Grand Canyon

STEVE'S PLANE HEADS DOWN THE GRAND CANYON. THE ALIEN FOLLOWS HIM IN.

STEVE Come on and get me! Come and get me!

THE ALIEN FIRES AGAIN, CAUSING A CLOUD OF FIRE JUST AHEAD OF STEVE.

STEVE What are you shooting at?

STEVE MANAGES TO GET THROUGH THE CLOUD OF FIRE, AS DOES THE ALIEN.

STEVE Where you at, baby? Come on! Come on!

STEVE'S POV: HE FLIES THROUGH THE CANYON. THE ALIEN'S POV: IT AIMS FOR STEVE AND FIRES - AND MISSES.

STEVE Aw, you can't hit nothing!

THE ALIEN'S POV: IT FIRES AGAIN. STEVE LOOKS AT HIS FUEL GAUGE. IT SAYS "WARNING: FUEL LOW! TANK 1/4 021% TANK 2/3 - 000% MISSION TERMINATION IMPERATIVE". STEVE PASSES THROUGH A NARROW PART OF THE CANYON.

STEVE Hiyah!

THE ALIEN FOLLOWS, SHOOTS AND MISSES. STEVE'S POV: AN ALIEN SHOT BRINGS DOWN PART OF THE CANYON JUST IN FRONT OF HIM. IT STARTS TO FALL INTO HIS PATH.

STEVE Ho! Low bridge! Whoa!

STEVE JUST MAKES IT UNDER IN TIME. THE ALIEN FLIES OVER THE PIECE OF ROCK. STEVE LOOKS AT HIS FUEL GAUGE AGAIN. IT NOW SAYS "WARNING: FUEL LOW! TANK 1/4 000% TANK 2/3 - 005% RESERVE (THE NUMBER IS GOING DOWN TOO RAPIDLY FOR US TO SEE IT) MISSION TERMINATION IMPERATIVE". STEVE LOOKS AHEAD. HE IS ALMOST AT THE END OF THE CANYON!

STEVE See if you can fly that thing under cover!

HE PULLS A LEVER AND THE PARACHUTE COMES OUT FROM THE BACK OF THE PLANE, COVERING THE ALIEN SHIP.

STEVE Hope you got a air bag!

STEVE EJECTS FROM HIS PLANE JUST BEFORE IT CRASHES INTO THE CANYON. THE ALIEN SHIP MANAGES TO FLY TO THE TOP OF THE CANYON, THUS AVOIDING CRASHING INTO IT LIKE STEVE'S PLANE, BUT IT CRASHES TO THE GROUND NEXT TO THE CANYON. STEVE FALLS TO EARTH WITH HIS PARACHUTE.

STEVE Hiyah!

HE LANDS AND PUSHES OFF HIS PARACHUTE. STEVE'S POV: HE SEES THE ALIEN SHIP ON THE GROUND. IT IS SMOKING.

STEVE Son of a bitch!

HE STARTS RUNNING TOWARDS THE ALIEN SHIP SCREAMING.

STEVE That's right! That's right! (RE: PARACHUTE) Get off me! Get off of me! That's what you get! Ha ha! Look at you! Ship all banged up! Who's the man? Huh? Who's the man? Wait 'til I get another plane! I'm lining all your friends up right beside you!

STEVE STARTS CLIMBING UP THE SIDE OF THE SHIP.

STEVE Where you at, huh? Huh? Where you at?

THE ALIEN'S POV: STEVE OPENS THE DOOR. WE CAN SEE THE ALIEN'S TENTACLES. STEVE'S POV: THERE IS SMOKE. SUDDENLY THE ALIEN APPEARS! IT ROARS AT STEVE. STEVE PUNCHES IT REALLY HARD AND KNOCKS IT OUT.

STEVE Welcome to Earth!

HE SITS DOWN AND GETS OUT A CIGAR.

STEVE Now, that's what I call a close encounter.
