[Will Smith]
Original - a first form from which varities arise
An authentic work of art as opposed to an imitation, or reproduction

[Verse One: Will Smith]
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around
I spit heat rock, and I ain't talkin rollin
Soon as the beat knock I'm crown controllin
When I hear y'all that's an awful sound
I don't ride beats, I take 'em off the ground
Land 'em somewhere, show 'em the town
Even on foreign ground let 'em know I'm around
I don't follow e'rybody when it's time to rap
At one time e'rybody thought the world was flat
Sounds like you? That was my intention
I paid dues, now dudes pay attention
I live for it, even though the flicks is hittin
Crib's sick, you can see the booth from the kitchen
Speak on it, cause I saw it happen
This is hip-hop, dawg I ain't just rappin
Y'all lookin at a real MC man
You couldn't check a mic from me

[Hook: Will Smith]
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow, the way y'all flow
Or do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now
Y'all in the hip-hop lost and found
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
Let's talk about rhyme capability
Let's talk about hip-hop versatility
Let's talk about takin the game beyond
How the hell we gon' have a battle of wits? Trick you unarmed
Let's talk about love for the game
I mean real love, back before there was fame
I'm real with it, I ain't claimin to reign
But when y'all talk about rap, y'all gon' start sayin my name
F'real though, I ain't playin
Plenty of y'all love a brother, just scared to say it
Yo, first ever rap Grammy
Let's talk about the only reason yo' ass went to Miami - yup!
Truck with rims - check; throwback jersey - check
Champagne bottles - check; lots of models - DAMN!
That's the list for 90% of y'all videos and songs
Am I WRONG?!

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Will Smith]
Lost - when you a slave to the biz
With no care for the cost of what you sayin to kids
Found is when your lyrics are a test of time
And your mind hear that your spirit is blessed divine
Lost is when you rhyme 'til your throat gets sore
But you don't even believe what you say no more
Found is when you bleed heart into the mic
And the pain you sustain it could change a life
Lost is when you hide behind the freedom of speech
Well sure you're free to do it, but what it mean to do it
Did you mean to do it? Did you need to do it?
Did you take time to think about the seed you ruined? (HUH?)
Found is Esco, Dead Prez and them
Found is Lauryn Hill
Found is Rakim
Found can be you if you felt the message
And ask yourself this question
