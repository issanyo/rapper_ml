[ The Fresh Prince on the phone ]
Hello?
Yeah, this is Prince, who's this?
Yo, what's up baby, how you doin?
Oh, I'm tryin to see you on a personal tip
You know that, right?
Heh
Ah come on
You been tellin me that for years
You're a little bit older than me, you know?
You're 30 years old and I'm 20
Age ain't nothin but a number, baby
Hey look, I'm young but I'm real strong
Heh
Hey look, I know that, I know, I know
I can't sport you around in my Benzito
And take you out to dinner and be seen
You know
That's cool, though
I tell you what
I tell you what
Got a remedy for this problem
This is what I want you to do
I want you to get a globe, right?
I want you to spin the globe, spin it hard baby
Pick anywhere in the world
And I'll take you there
We'll be together, alright?
You with that?

[ The Fresh Prince ]
Greek mythological gods are inferior
Studs and playboys, come on, I'm superior
Any man can look and see where the curves are
It takes a real man to find where the nerves are
Women like huggin, kissin and carressin
And eh - ssssslooowww undressin
Calm down, chill out, take your time, dude
Don't be all rough and fast like a monsoon
Women are soft and fragile, you know delicate
It's really not appealin to then when the fella gets
All worked up and rushes to the pinnacle
You might think so, but yo, they ain't with it though
Candlelight dinner, just you and her in a
Nice restaurant is always a winner
Then ah - if she is first rate and on the first date
She says no, be patient, don't push her, just wait
Because a woman is a gift to a man
They like you +real+ hard but with a gentle hand
So get your act together cause if you're trippin up
If you're slippin up, then F.P. is pickin up
All of y'all slack men, cause what you're lackin
I fill up, so ain't no need to come back, man
Everything ain't always the way that it seems
I'm the Fresh Prince, baby doll, and I'm the man of your dreams

[ Jazzy Jeff on the phone ]
Yo, what's up
Yeah, this Jeff
Yeah, I heard you talked to Prince today, huh?
Yeah
Let me guess
He's 'young but strong'
Yeah
I kinda figured that
Let me ask you a question
Did he kick the 'globe' line on you?
Yeah, I thought so
I heard that before too
Look, I'm not into geography
So I'm not gonna ask you to spin no globe and point to where you wanna go
Or spend no dollars or even do back-semis when I come in the room
Because I'm not into that
You know, all I'm askin for is 60 minutes of your time
And I can set the whole record straight
You know what I'm sayin?

[ Jazzy Jeff ]
I'm not tryin to say nothin that's hard or complex
Or get you psyched with a pose or body flex
I win your lovin with a paid vacation
You know, I'm more into a intellectual stimulation
I make your mind feel good, your body follows it
I pour lovin in, your mind swallows it
I'm not dissin Prince, cause he's my friend
But boys'll be boys and men'll be men
Ladies, your battery's unstable?
Jazzy Jeff got the world's best jumping cables
14'000 volts of pure intimacy
That's enticin to you? Yeah, it was meant to be
Don't debate the great flow of fate
Let he who's Jazzy have you concentrate
Think of me and you makin love as a team
I'm Jazzy Jeff, baby doll, and I'm the man of your dreams

[ The Fresh Prince ]
Yo Jeff, what up, hop?
[ Jazzy Jeff ]
What's up, man?
[ The Fresh Prince ]
Hey, I heard that you was tryin to talk to my girl
Man, what's up with that?
[ Jazzy Jeff ]
What, your girl?
[ The Fresh Prince ]
Yeah, my girl, I heard you heard you was tryin to talk to my girl
What's up
[ Jazzy Jeff ]
Nah, it ain't even like that, you know
If you was kickin stronger game
She wouldn't have to call me
[ The Fresh Prince ]
Stronger game?
Yo, you was tryin +push up+ on my girl
I wanna know what's up with that
[ Jazzy Jeff ]
Once again - your girl?
[ The Fresh Prince ]
Yeah
[ Jazzy Jeff ]
I think you better get the record straight, man
[ The Fresh Prince ]
Ah
You said my girl was pushin up on you
Ain't too much to be pushin up on!
[ Jazzy Jeff ]
I mean that's true, you know
But you know you kickin that 'spin the globe' and all of that crazy stuff
She ain't with that
[ The Fresh Prince ]
Aight, aight, aight
We ain't even gotta go into this
Hey, I'm confident in myself
I'm sure you're confident in yourself
We'll let her decide
[ Jazzy Jeff ]
Yeah, you know
We can let her decide over a nice candlelight dinner at my spot
Cause that's where she gon' be tonight
[ The Fresh Prince ]
Oh heh - dinner
You better hope she can +make+ it to dinner after she had lunch with me
[ Jazzy Jeff ]
Oh yeah?
[ The Fresh Prince ]
Yeah, word up
[ Jazzy Jeff ]
You lead it off, I end it off
[ The Fresh Prince ]
Yeah alright, homie
You better check yourself 'fore you wreck yourself
[ Jazzy Jeff ]
Ooh, I'm scared, I'm scared
