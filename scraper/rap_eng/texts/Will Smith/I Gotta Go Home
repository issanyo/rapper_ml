[Chorus]
Girl stop shaking
You got my will breaking
Lovin' Jamaica but I gotta go home
I got my girl waitin'
I'm spos' to land at eight and
If I'm not there then I can't go home
Ma you got me bakin'
I'm bout' to make a mistakin'
I'm bout' to ask you to take me home
Please stop shaking
You got my will breakin'
Lovin Jamaica but I gotta go home

[Verse 1]
Ten days I'm in Jamaica workin'
Ain't' had a chance to get out and do to much than nothin' else but workin'
It's killin' me
Ain't' had a chance to get that chicky jerkin'
Responsibility taste the victory but desire lerkin'
I been recording right and rappin' and ryming
Notin' but heat ain't' even had a chance to see the island
I need dat'
Me and the team we got a dream a' comin'
The spot we heard about through her mouth
This club of silam
Let's finish up
Then like a breeze off the sea's
When you arrive at the party
Host this
She Desserie flirtin' heavily with me
Got me thinkin' things I really probobly shouldn't be
Evertime she move she look at me

(Chorus)

[Verse 2]
(Everytime she moves)
I don't know how to act
Came to get my groove on
Not to get my groove back
Her eyes deep enough to swim in
She grinnin'
Her innersence inpire thoughts of sinnin'
Crazy right?
She got a  -  flower so long she smilin'
Her shakin' makin' Jamaica seem like temptation island
I'm wilin'
Cause' man she hot
What I'm gonna do?
Feelin' like the moment of truth
Fakin' my concience
Lovin the mood
What's a brother to do?
Makin' me think Desserie a Jamaican queen
Makin' me hatin' to leave cause' the shakin' is mean
Windin' hips
Got me growin' fond of this islandness but i'm manganese
So far y'all

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
(Could it be that she's lookin' at me)
(Sendin' messages sweat Desserie)
(Try na' get away cause she was meant for me)
(Oh no I'm tryin' to get home)
(Tell me what else is a man's to do)
(When temptation is comin' at you)
(I love my girl but I see somthing new)
(Oh no I gotta get home)

If I want you so
Me want you so
(I may never want to go home)
If I want you so
Me want you so
(I may never want to go home)
If I want you so
Me want you so
(I may never want to go home)
If I want you so
Me want you so
(I may never want to go home)

(Chorus)

If I want you so
Me want you so
(I may never want to go home)
(Repeat 6x)
