Come, come on
Come on, come, come on
MIB
The black suits comin'
The black suits comin'
I'm comin', I'm comin' I'm comin', I'm comin'
I am the man in black, I'm back
Breaking the back of the random attackers
So can the flak, yo I'm dangerous
I've been trained to bust
When a stranger fuss try to endanger us
Praise me y'all, don't nothin' faze me y'all
When they see me their gaze be all crazy y'all
They say I'm a myth, trust me if somebody riff
Out of the depth of your imagination appears Will Smith
Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style black Ray Bans, I'm stunnin' man
New hotness pitch black six hundred man
Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again?
Leave you hangin' without bringin' you the fun again
Tanglin' with the alien scum again
Mind your manners or the black suits runnin' in
Nod ya head
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you nod ya head, like this
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you nod ya head, like this
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you bop your head
Nod your head, come on
Nod ya head
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you nod ya head, like this
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you nod ya head, like this
(The black suits comin')
Nod ya head
Check it, yo it's this chick right
Serlena, makin' me sick right
Earth is worthless to her she be trippin' like
Threatenin' me and my mens, tryin' to get the light
Thinkin' she's Superwoman
But black Kryptonite finishin' whatever you start son
The best lookin' crime fighter since myself in part one
Better act right and play nice and sing along
'Cuz K is back and he hype, what? Bring it on
Uhh, wanna brawl with me? Trying to brawl with me?
Uhh, uhh, what? What?
Yo, what? What? Then lemme see you just
Come on, just come on and
Nod ya head, like this
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you nod ya head
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you nod ya head, like this
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you, nod ya head
Let me see you, nod ya head
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you, nod ya head
Come on, come on, let me see you
Nod ya head, like this
(The black suits comin')
Let me see you, nod ya head
Check it, check it, yo, case closed, erase my foes
Chased away by the black suits, shades, and clothes
We above the law, Feds can't touch me y'all
Highly ranked black blank I.D. card, so disregard
What you think you saw, put that phone down now
Who you think you callin' huh?
One little flash then good night dear
Just open your eyes honey look right here
Thank you mission completed, I mean it we won't be defeated
You seen it we did it even with weapons depleted
Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember
Takin' contenders and provin' they only pretenders
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
The Men In Black is back to protect the world
When the enemy is near the elite is here
So have no fear just let me see you
Nod Ya Head
(The black suit's comin')
Come on, nod ya head, like this
(The black suit's comin')
Let me see you, nod ya head, like this
(The black suit's comin')
Let me see you, nod ya head
