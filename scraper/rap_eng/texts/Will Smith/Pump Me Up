Round the block
Back in philly man the album was late
Gratitude instead a attitude for making ya wait
Time to retaliate against the players that hate

Brothers always screaming about keeping it real
Don't get no realer than the mic with your boy on the wheels
True dat yall can run but you can't escape he like a

Based on chemistry
No need for sensing me
Your hennisee
Top dogs from the hood
Popping back to the hood

Yo Jeff it's been a minute since me and you ripped
But some of the ol diehards might have thinked that you flipped
I heard some guy implied that you lost your cut
How you respond to that Jeff
*Ha what?*
What's a rapper if his cuts don't fit?
*Nuthin*
And what's a DJ if his cuts don't hit Jeff?
