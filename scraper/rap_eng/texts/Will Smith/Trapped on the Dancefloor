[Verse 1: The Fresh Prince]

You're trapped on the dance floor
It's locked there's no escape
There's no eat no drink can't take a break
No seat to sit down you gotta stand up
The record on the wheel reacts like a handcuff
You're in a cage and this groove will bound you
People in the club like bars around you
The doors open up and the people are pulled in
Here are the prisoners the DJ is a warden
Your mind is useless instinct takes control
Jam to techno groove to soul to soul
You been arrested, now you're being tested
The beat is a sex fiend, you're being molested
Stead drum kicks like pistol in spinal
You gotta dance and get rammed like a rhino
The DJ cuts with a knife like a surgery
Sayin that the slice ain't nice that's perjury
The music infiltrates you and takes you
Grabs you holds you molds you and makes you
Do things you wouldn't have otherwise done
Like shake rattle roll pump twist and then some
Ain't no law here you can't protest this
Stop looking around, there ain't no exits
You can't leave till the man pulls the needle
Take that as a warning, take heed or I'll
Quicken the pitch and make you dance faster
The drum is the whip, bass line is the master
Temperature's hotter and yet you still want more
You're a slave and you're trapped on the dance floor

[Chorus]

Oh oh I'm trapped like a fool I'm in a cage
I can't get out
Can't you see I'm trapped
Can't you see I'm so confused
I can't get out

Now you're wandering lost in a jungle
You came in hyped up but now you're humble
Bringing out sweat in your silky wet clothes
You scream for help, blend in with the "ow"s and "ho"s
You try to sit but there ain't no spaces
The floor is a desert, a body oasis
I know you're on the tip for the rhyme I just did
But here's a little taste of my homeboy, El Sid

[Verse 2: El Sid]

Ay a prince it's the El Sid's version
I'm a raid on the track, I'm a hip-hop surgeon
The floor is jam packed get away from the bar scene
The strum of the drum has you trapped like a sardine
You try to move no form of escape
The heat brings on sweat, stick on like tape
Party's like a pimp
Girls slim and trim on the floor
Don't try to shoot for the door
This ain't the gym
The party goers every night had a scene
This mic try to respond but still trapped like Venus
Ain't a spiff or a spoof
Boy you better not goof
You about to cave in although you ain't on a roof
The rhythm track from offside's to angles
Playing the wimp fight resist ... strangle
You can't escape until the DJ's banger's up
So play like a phone or coat and just hang it up
The speakers pumping out sounds and hip words
Lines between the rhythm designed to equip nerds
You better jam we don't care if you hardcore
Cause we got you trapped on the dance floor

[Chorus 2x]

Me and Prince got together just to kick our lines
No trouble at the party cause we're strapped with nines
Dance floor secure, don't bother trying to get out
You looking for the late AM this man pull a head out
Nobody cause killing is mean
Got ya dancing in the dark and dressed like Springsteen
Razzamatazz a pizazz about to rip the flesh is my man Jazz Fresh

[Verse 3: Jazz Fresh]

Soon as I worked through the door
I got trapped on the dance floor
See this girlie that I never saw
She was looking raw
Came a little closer
Then I approached her
Then I drop the fox trot so hot that I roast her
Break the floor into flames it's the damn shame
Hard to explain
I did it up like I was straight out of Soul Train
Listen as I discuss this yo bust this
Like Hammer in front of a camera, you can't touch this
Trapped on the floor like a vulture
Part of my culture
You might even thought I would drive to falter
Get live like the Jackson Five, Tito and Jermaine
Add a little Mike and Janet you can't understand it
Cause ham and Mike??? thought I was from another planet
Way I'm whipping and dipping
And sliding and slowly guiding to what I'm providing
Other dancers go and hide
Like Charles Manson
I'm prancin'
I keep you dancin' all night until
The party's over the party's over
Like a cowboy at a rodeo
Commence to make you do-si-do
Around the dance floor
Step to the new hardcore
I'm Jazz Fresh and I'm trapped

[Chorus]

Next up to step up
Just to keep this rep up
The time that he possesses the best in a contest
Def with his right and left like Jazz Fresh
No other than the brother the lover Jazzy Jeff

[Verse 4: DJ Jazzy Jeff]

I'm the one dance floor at the station
??? time around quarter to ten
Time served hard
The customers scarred
Your tickets to freedom
Yo you ain't gonna need 'em
Your sentence is 25 years to life
A bed and a pillow is your husband and wife
Trapped behind the steel
The steel of the wheels
Don't come to the party if you don't wanna know how prison feels
I walk strong carry a big stick
Sell myself all packed in thick
When they sound the drum you know its time to roll
Might as well have fun there's no parole
I set a trap and caught you like a mouse
For times ahead no chance for a halfway house
Pump the bass in all sections
Prince, Sid, and Jazz my officers of correction
Can't escape the floor cut the crime out
Fortified wall ain't no use trying to climb out
Cause I'm running this show and it's live in here
You try to escape another five years
I got you trapped and I'm your savior
You dance real hard you might get out on good behavior
But if you don't I give you more
Cause DJ Jazzy Jeff got you trapped on the dance floor

[Chorus 2x]
