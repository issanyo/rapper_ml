Intro, the maestro
Nice flow, hot like nitro
Cool as ice though
That type of docodimy
Y'all know it's gotta be
Who else could it be, but me
Rub your eyes but hold the big billy
It's dream supreme bean straight from philly
It's the eclectic female attractor
Rapper slash actor, right back at ya
And to the next millinium
Many come but few are chosen
See me servin' like the u.s. open
Another type of hustler, listed at blockbuster
Go and ask a movie usher
Who is he, he or she, sfp, movies, cd's, and tv's
But uh uh, 'cause the day i take a break from that
As i rule where a tank of gas take me at
I used to rock these, red, i rock z's
Now i rock the mb's, with twelves and v's
Today sun high, up in the sky, from ny
La la, to mi

Just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'

Easy wrote a sixty
Flossin' ninety degrees
Sony cartridges, ten cd's each
Reach to the beach
South side leanin'
It ain't often i'm off and i'm feelin' for the top down, drop down
Got me hot now heated up can't stop now
What up cutie what sure sure is cooking now
Yo i know, i'm spoken for can't hurt lookin', no
Pop cd's, b.i.g.'s, and 2Pac's
While cruisin' on the blocks
Hittin' the hot spots
Got my celly on o-f-f
Golden arches got my belly goin' oh yes yes
So let's just ease on down, ease on down the road
No pager roll my hip
As i'm rollin' my whip
'cause today i'm on the solo creek
Man, why you think i be workin' so hard all week?

I'm just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'

Just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'

Sun settin' in the s-k-y
Must say i've had the best day i
Tryin' to find an exit
A place to chill not to hectic
So i can spend some time with will
Let the sun shine to the moonlight clearin' my mind
Soul search, see what i find
If i'm being the best lover and friend
Am i being the best daddy i can?
I pray i am
And i feel good today
Reminiece as i'm cruisin' around the way
Roll tight passed the park where i used to play
Can't think of a better way to spend my day
Uh, still findin' my way
Still growin', petrol rowin', move soon showin'
Gots to get goin' losing the light
And the freaks come out at night

Just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'

I'm just cruisin' where, baby, i don't care
Just cruisin' as long as you take me there
Just cruisin' somewhere to clear my mind
Just cruisin' just cruisin'
