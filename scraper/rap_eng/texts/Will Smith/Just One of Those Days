Have you ever in your life experienced a day
Where nothing at all seems to go your way
No matter how hard you try to get out of the rut
You just could not break the string of bad luck
A day where Murphy's law takes over your life
And you just can't seem to do a darn thing right
And when the day was over you just had to say
You said man it's just one of those days

My day started off kind of cool
I brushed my teeth I combed my hair and I got dressed and went to school
I stopped at the store for a breakfast snack
A tasty cake and orange juice and a bubble yum pack
About that point I proceeded to class
I spoke to all the pretty girls that I passed
I went to my room which was on the first floor
I had no idea what I was in for
I sat in my desk and minded my own business
Someone knocked on the door the teacher said who is it
This girl walked in my imagination ran wild
She stole my heart just by the way that she smiled
I couldn't resist so I grabbed her butt
She said what's wrong with you fool are you some kind of nut
The teacher turned around while my arm was extended
She looked me in the face and said Prince you're suspended
I said your tripping it's just a bad habit
She put it in my face she must've wanted me to grab it
I pleaded my case but she wrote the pink slip
Then I just shoke my head I said I don't beleive this
She sent me to the head of the discipline staff
I tried to play it off so I started to laugh
I said ha ha this story is great
It's a big misunderstanding one big mistake
He didn't think that it was funny he didn't even smile
He said mmm mmm mmm you're an unlucky child
I stopped laughing and I said why is that
He said just get out my school and don't you ever come back
I said wait this is my school and you're telling me to leave it
He handed me my books and said yep you'd best beleive it
As I walked out the school back at the wall I did gaze
And said man it's just one of those days

I woke up around a quarter to eight
I wiped the sleep from out my eyes and I was feeling great
I flipped my radio on and to my utter surprise
I thought that it was eight o'clock but it was half past nine
I hopped up and put my feet on the floor
Ran to the bathroom then I (ow) hit my foot on the door
The pain was immense as it started to throb
I said to hell with broken toes I was losing my job
So I combed my hair then I brushed my teeth
Threw on my Fila suit and my Fila sneaks
Threw on my Fila underwear and my
Fila hat
Then I ran downstairs and kicked the fila cat
I grabbed my jacket then I grabbed my keys
Then I prayed out loud car start please
The car started but what good was that
I couldn't drive it anyway because the tires were flat
I did the hundred yard dash to the top of my block
Then I grabbed a dollar bill from my left sweat sock
The bus pulled up I was late and kind of nervous
I got real mad because the sign said out of service
I started hiking it I wasn't liking it
I saw a little kid I stole his bike and started biking it
I thought I got away but when I ducked around the corner
There was twelve cop cars I said I'm a goner
Slamed on the flat I did 180 turn
Peddled the bike so fast I heard the rubble burn
With the cops in hot pursuit I started feeling like a jerk
I thought man all of this cause I was trying to get to work
I could've got away I almost had 'em shook
Til this girl walked by something said not to look
But I thought what the heck a little peek can't hurt
But she made me miss the sign that said men at work
I screamed out loud as I crashed through the baracade
I saw my whole life flash before my face
I felt kind of dizzy all I saw was stars
I put my hands over my eyes and settled on the handle bars
That was stupid I got off track
Cause about that point everything went black
The next thing I remember is a head ache nagging
I woke up face down in the back of a paddy wagon
I pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dead
A big Flinstone lump on the side of my head
They took my picture and my finger prints
I said wait you can't arrest me I'm the Fresh Prince
I demand that you release me you incompetent fool
You can't arrest me I'm the Prince you know the rules
You got five seconds 'fore I punch out your lights
But then the cop pulled out his gun I said ha ha psyche
I had a call so I called my boss
I figured I might as well what else could be lost
Boss I'm sorry that I couldn't make it today
He said what are you talking about you're off today is Saturday
Stuck in a cell scared as hell
I'm a hungry kind of tired and I hate this awful smell
Maybe one day I'll get smart and change my ways
But for now it's just one of those days

It's just one of those days
