[Scratched] "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"

[Fresh Prince]
Now let's get this party started off the right way
Oww and HOE I think the crowd might say
When we're on stage you know you can't resist
{"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"}
I'm the ultimate and that's all I can say
I sat down for about eight hours today
Tryin to figure out the proper description of ME
And I came to the decision that
There's no one syllable or phrase
That can adequately describe this new craze
But I'll sum it up in one sentence, let's see
OK, I've got it, "All praise me!"
Yup -- that's about the size of it
I know it sounds kinda strange, doesn't it?
But when we're on the stage you know you can't resist
{"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"}

[Scratched] "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"

It was a Friday afternoon if I remember it correctly
But I can't quite recall the time exactly
But it was somewhere around, two or three or four
Oh forget it, let's just go on
Anyway I stepped out of school
Sneaks were Gucci shirt was Polo and my pockets were full
Blew some kisses to the girlies cause I like to tease
They started chantin my name, I said, "Ladies.. please!"
I grabbed my friends and hopped in my Benz
Grabbed a Martini and Rossi passed out to my posse
Things were lookin good. I had plans for later on
Plans for Donna Michelle, plans for Stacy LeShaun
Word! I was ready, I wonder if Jeff's home
Let me give him a call, on my car phone
Yo Jeff, what's shakin?
[Jazzy Jeff] Coolin, whassup?
[Fresh Prince] Girlies
[Jazzy Jeff] I'm with it, come pick me up!!!
[Fresh Prince] I caught up with Ready on the way to Jeff's
A whole carload of girlies and they ALL was def
We walked into Jeff's and said, "Girls, you can't resist"
{"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"}

[Scratched] "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"

[Fresh] Yo Jeff man, are you with me?
{Jeff scratches.. "Hit it!"}
[Fresh] I didn't hear you man, are you with me?
{Jeff scratches.. "Hit it!"}
[Fresh] I'm with it to GET BUSY!

[Scratched] "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"

[Fresh Prince]
Ready Rock C, give Jeff a hand!

{Ready Rock beatboxes while Jeff scratches the same sample}

[Scratched] "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"

[Fresh Prince]
Throw away them chairs, cause you don't need em anymore
Cause this hip-hop hit, is gonna keep you on the floor
If you dance everyday or if you never danced before
It doesn't matter if it's {"somethin like this"}
Time is essential, so let's make the best of it
Today we don't have a lot of time, so let's not throw it all away
Let's use this time in a very special way
Let's use it, {"somethin like this"}
I went outside at about 12:30
I saw a couple girlies, and they were lookin pretty good!
.. if you know what I mean
So I freshened my breath and stepped on the scene
I walked over to em, stepped in between them
One stepped to the other, "I think that I've seen him
Somewhere before." I said, "Sweetheart, you might have"
She said, "Oh yeah, it was last night
At that party." I said, "Yeah I tried to talk to you there
But you were acting as if you were scared."
She said, "I'm not scared now." I said, "Bet, well let's go then."
She said, "But hold up, what about my friend?"
I said, "I got a friend!" So the three of us left
Went back to my crib and gave a call to Jeff
Five minutes later Jeff walked in
And I thought to myself, "Yeah, now the fun begins!"
But the girls started buggin, and they said, "Now we want
Dinner in the best restaurant in town
We want caviar and lobster tails, both by candlelight
And Dom Perignon." I said, "Yeah right!"
Y'all must be crazy, and Jeff said
[Jazzy Jeff] "Y'know?
I really think it's time for these ladies to go."
[Fresh Prince] We walked em to the door and told em they were dismissed
And it went a little {"somethin like this"} *door slams*
But that was okay, that was alright
Cause we still had fun that night -- yaknowit!
The moral of the story is plain and visible
We always watch out for those kind of women
But the past is the past and the present is the present
And we feel that everyone should be sitting down
{"so you all don't miss"}
