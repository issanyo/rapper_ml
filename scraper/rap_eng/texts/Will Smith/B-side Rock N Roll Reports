[Verse 1 (Will Smith)]
Wild Wild West (Yeahhhhhhhahhhhhhhh!)
Jim West, desperado
Rough rider, no you don't want nada
None of this, six-gunnin this, brother runnin this
Buffalo soldier, look it's like I told ya
Any damsel that's in distress
Be outta that dress when she meet Jim West
Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step or flex and get a hole in your side
Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react
You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at
With Artemus, from the start of this, runnin the game
James West, tamin the West, so remember the name

[Will Smith] * [Sisqo] (shared lines in caps)
Now, now, now
Now once upon a time in the West
Mad man lost his damn mind in the West
Loveless, KIDNAP A DIME, nuttin less
Now I must, PUT HIS BEHIND TO THE TEST [S: Can you feel me?]
Then through the shadows, in the saddle, ready for battle
Bring all your boys in, here come the poison
Behind my back, all that riffin ya did
Front and center, now where your lip at kid? [S: Lookin at me!]
Who dat is? A mean brother, bad for your health
Lookin damn good though, if I could say it myself
Told me Loveless is a mad man, but I don't fear that
He got mad weapons too? Ain't tryin to hear that
Tryin to bring down me, THE CHAMPION?
When y'all clowns gon' see that it CAN'T BE DONE
Understand me son, I'm the slickest they is
I'm the quickest they is [S: Yeahhhhhhhhhhhh]
Did I say I'm the slickest they is?
