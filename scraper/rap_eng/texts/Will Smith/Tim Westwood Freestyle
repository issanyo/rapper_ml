None of my lyrics are extraneous
Rhymes are spontaneous
I am the Fresh Prince and I am as brainy as
GALILEO
Wiser than Einstein
With the strength parallel to that of a land mine
I change to my surroundings, like
A CHA-ME-LE-ON
Sometimes I’m serious
And sometimes I’m silly
And in time you’ll see, my energy can’t be withheld
If it’s a sin to be a winner, then I’m going to hell
Setting the course for the tippy-tippy-top
And my goal is to be the undisputed king of hip-hop
Not trying to say that I’m the best, I swear it
But as the saying goes, if the shoe fits, then wear it
It’s not that I’m better than the rest, well, you see
It’s just that nobody is as good as me
SO I’M HUMBLE
When I’m complimented each day
I’m like, well, you know, what can I say?
My lyrics are praised, just like the scripture
The grammar is correct and they’re as vivid as a picture
I’m not the Messiah, the truth I must tell
I can’t walk on water, but I can swim like hell
I was taught by the world’s greatest MC
A man who undisputedly rules the whole rap industry
I was taught to be all that I can be
I was taught by a hell of a guy
ME
So don’t try to stop me, because I can’t be stopped
Don’t knock what I’m doing because I can’t be knocked
This is the night network, Friday night, you know
Westwood and me, the N-Sign Rap Show
