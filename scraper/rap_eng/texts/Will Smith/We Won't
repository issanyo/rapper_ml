Na na na
Mister engineer, ya need to turn me up (yeah)
Time to hit the floor now (whoo)
Big Will (and) DJ Kool
Yo, yo, yo
The crowd captivator, hunt miles past the haters
Stadium and colliseum, pack ya later
I take the Soundscan, Billboard elevator
To the top floor, can't see me? (get ya weight up)
My labor made my paper favor major wages
July fourth box office mutilator
I made the ladies show shade at a player
When I made the play to snatch up Jada (na na na)
On the fader, DJ Jazzy Jeff headin on the paper
I do my thing fresh from alpha to omega
To my last breath I'm the anti-perpetrator
Tryin' to contest, better bring along
All ya boys, if you comin' I'm King Kong
Little toys better run or just sing along
Gettin' mad cause your girl keep clingin' on
Sing the song y'all, come on
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't, we won't (slow down)
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't (uh uh) we won't (uh uh)
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't, we won't (slow down)
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't (uh uh) we won't (oh no)
Come on baby, can we take it down (what?)
Come on baby, can we break it down? (uh uh)
Please baby, can we slow it down? (nope)
Then come with it, we can work it now
Here I come with the sound of the drummy drum drum
If you're really dumb, homie come and get some
Don't front on a top gun when you're not one
Ten top tens, you ain't even got one
Here I come with the sound of the drummy drum drum
If you're really dumb, homie come and get some
Don't front on a top gun when you're not one
Ten top tens, you ain't got none
Chronic awards show nominee
And the biggest movie of the year, trust I'ma be in it
See me in the Bentley deep tinted
Six time Grammy's presented
Never been timid (yeah)
Accolades from the crowd give me incentive to keep bein' inventive
It's a crowd on the floor, I'm in it
It's an award, I'ma win it, trust in it!
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't, we won't (slow down)
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't (uh uh) we won't (uh uh)
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't, we won't (slow down)
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't (uh uh) we won't (oh no)
Come on baby, can we take it down (what?)
Come on baby, can we break it down? (uh uh)
Please baby, can we slow it down? (nope)
Then come with it, we can work it now
Are you ready for the arsonist?
Non-stop, no pause in this
You don't really want no parts of this
Dial 9-1-1 tell 'em Big Will the cause of this
One caution Miss, when you come up in here flossin' Miss
Little stiletto heels, you gonna be tossin' Miss
Got lips like Rosario Dawson, Miss
Come here, give the boss a kiss
If your man gotta ask, "what's the cause of this?"
Probably can't properly sauce your wrist
If he lost your wrist, really shouldn't toss a fist
Ever since 'Ali' it's an automatic loss in this
I must insist, blindly you trust in this
Smash hit, still didn't cuss in this
Foreign chicks, blushin' twists
Russian chicks fainted from touchin' this, must insist
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't, we won't (slow down)
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't (uh uh) we won't (uh uh)
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't, we won't (slow down)
We won't, we won't (stop y'all)
We won't (uh uh) we won't (oh no)
Come on baby, can we take it down (what?)
Come on baby, can we break it down? (uh uh)
Please baby, can we slow it down? (nope)
Then come with it, we can work it now
Here I come with the sound of the drummy drum drum
If you're really dumb, homie come and get some
Don't front on a top gun when you're not one
Ten top tens, you ain't even got one
Here I come with the sound of the drummy drum drum
If you're really dumb, homie come and get some
Don't front on a top gun when you're not one
Ten top tens, you ain't got none
