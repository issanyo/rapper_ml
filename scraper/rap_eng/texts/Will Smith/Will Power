[Will Smith Interlude]

[Verse 1]
I was told that a man doesn’t shed any salt
So I’ll swallow blood before I beg for support
It’s like playing tennis, getting bread is a sport
Then go back and forth with the feds in a court
I bled and I fought, it’s why I dread coming short
The thoughts of suicide in my head wasn’t fraud
I left a signature that the speds couldn’t forge
We don’t take the same path as we head for the morgue
So with that in mind, I live to the fullest
So frank with my hustle you would think I was Lucas
The haters are always in sync with my newest
But I simply recall with no Inc I can do this
Let me tell y’all what I think of the Judas
They can die slow like I winked at the shooters
1’s for the money, 2’s for the troopers
A nigga tries me he’s loosing, I do this

[Verse 2]
But you want to talk skill? Well, who can touch mine?
I’m leaving you all crossed out like a plus sign
All about a million therefore I scream "fuck dimes!!!"
Colors on the ice so I'll call the watch slush time
You ain’t fazing Karl with them gay words stupid
I’m raising the bar like I gave birth to it
If you’re hand cuffing don’t bring your broad fam
Because I’ll will probably get her, I swing like Tarzan
Been about the cash flow ever since a rascal
Now I’ve probably had more misses than a Shaq throw
Living in a castle I don’t need to flash though (You)
Only see the green when you’re watching all your grass grow
Asshole, you’re pass slow, your speed’s like a tortoises’
I'd rather drive Lambos, and sleep in a fortress
Till my weed stash is like seeing a forest
Bet you’d probably go and give a knee to afford this
(Forfeit)

[Verse 3]
I’m a beast with the pen, I’ll show them what it does
They want to talk bars I’m flowing like a flood
Careless where you set it, I’ll always go above
These fake ass niggas, I call them Lola Love
And without her even knowing who I was
I showed her to the rug, she was blowing just because
You were better keep on token on them drugs
Cause’ that’s the only way you’ll notice any buzz
I’m soaking up the love, but the press got me messed up
Yet I won’t quit and that’s on left nut
We can all try to play like the best, but
There’s only one Karl, and all of the rest suck
Like Johnson I’m magic with the pen
The steps wouldn’t help, I’m an addict to the wins
You will need Shakespeare to top my writtens
But you couldn’t make a hit with boxing mitten
Try quitting
