[Chorus]
Caught (In life)
In the middle (In love)
Caught (In life)
In the middle (In love)
Caught (In life)
In the middle (In love)
Caught (In life)
In the middle (In love)

Caught (In life)
In the middle (In love)

[Verse 1]
Love and life a mysterious combo
Sit back relax cause now its time to go
Back in my past my personal strife for being
Caught in the middle of love and life
Love is a fairytale earthly bond
But life is true reality chimes
When life brings on love is kind of hard for you to give up
The satisfaction you started for
This is a metaphor sort of a riddle
If your confused chill and I'm sure it'll
Clear up for you in a little bit
Love and life and I'm caught in the middle of it

The middle
Caught
The middle

[Verse 2]
Who or why your love ain't always right
Especially when you cross the pass of life
The wrath of life is hard
Cause your taught to dream on
But when your out in the world realities on
You found somebody to be with
You pour your lovin in and it seems as if
You're pouring your love into a bottomless pit
You love each other but it just ain't workin
You're not meant to be together it seems like
Well just think maybe its things like
She work 9 to 5 you work 5 to 9
Never together two separate lives
Love versus life see what I mean
You like the movies she like the club scene
Nobody's wrong and nobody's right
Just caught in the middle of love and life

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Everybody wants to capture the rapture
Love and live happily ever after
Walking around barefoot sniffing daisies
Laying around all day long making babies
Go to France and dancin eatin in Sweden
Gambling in Rio
Winning cause you're cheating
These are situations you can have some fun in
But open your eyes and real life comes running in
Dreaming again a plateau to come down off
Back to the world and see your love life sounds off
Start the day right call your girlfriend
But love and life start at it again
She says baby I need to send you
You say babe I got work to tend to
Love tells you to go be with her
But life says boy get your butt to work
Think of love and life as a rock and a hard place
Exhilarating like a high speed car chase
Heart ache heart break cuts like a knife
Caught in the middle of love and life

[Chorus]

Caught... in the middle
Caught... in the middle
