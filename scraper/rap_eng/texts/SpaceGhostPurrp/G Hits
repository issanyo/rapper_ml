Drop a seat and sit
And see that it's a must we drop gangsta hits
Drop a seat and sit
And see that it's a must we drop gangsta sits

Mic check 1-2-1-2
It's the funk that we bump
And I really thought you knew

Drop a seat and sit
And see that its a must we drop gangsta
Mic check 1-2-1-2
It's the funk that we bump
And I really thought you knew
What can i do?
Drop a seat and sit
And see that its a must we drop gangsta
