[Verse 1]
Everybody know Lil Uzi, Yeah that nigga in the sun
Throw them devil horns up, Let you know I'm in'na somethin
Got a ho, she bag it up, Still a nigga never trust her
Just talked society, asked 'em, why I'm seeing red cousin
When I go to sleep, all I see, is my dead cousin
Better watch what you say, faggot niggas, they be air hustlin'
Oxygen would help the coke, so you know I'm air hustlin'
My bitch look like Aaliyah, so you know she dead cousin
And I'm still off all that lean, drink that shit till my stomach burst
I'ma die with no regrets, I'ma die with twenty sluts
These niggas smile in my face
But it's middle fingers behind closed doors
Blood, sweat, and tears in my pores
Talk shit, nigga it's a war
And I still look highly of this bitch
Even though I know that she a whore
I'ma go deep in that shit, heard her pussy wetter than the shore
Little do my mom know, got shotties all up in her floor
Put them bullet holes through a motherfucka' door
It ain't have to go on key
Got yo' bitch all on me
Like them titties all on key
I'ma bust all on these
I been killin' it, feelin' it
Rollin' off of that shit
Yeah I'm sipping all on that pint
Got yo' bitch all on my dick
That's word to D, speaking of D, he'll
Punch right in yo' teeth
Got yo' bitch all on my meat
I can probably kill it every way that I wanna'
And my bars, they be hotter than a fuckin' sauna
I'm, the hottest in this shit
The wildest in this shit
Got yo' bitch all on my shit she too legit to quit
Cause she got them hams on, tell that bitch it's MC Hammer
And I just go in, yeah my bitch like Kelsey Grammer, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
White shit, nigga this that white shit
I fucked yo' bitch nigga, she sucked my dick
I whip that shit nigga, that's a white brick
Saw a white nigga, so I hit a white lick
I ain't no killa' nigga, so don't push me
Talk shit, but you know I'm not a rookie
Ain't no killa, but don't push me and my man
Brought you that shit, you owe my man some pussy
(Thot, thot)
You's a bitch, and you's a slut
I heard them niggas down, they was fuckin' you in the butt
I don't give a mother fuck, honest shit
Got ya' ho walley, I water whip
Young Uzi, ya' bitch be my groupie
Yeah I'm drivin' in a 'Rari, yeah it's two-seat
And I be fuckin' with my nigga's, all day
And I be fuckin' with my nigga's, long way
