[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Niggas want USDA so I eat it like Thompson, Kenan
Sesame seedless, hood like Sesame Street is
If a nigga talking Oscar
Chopper turns the ghetto to a opera
So sing about me
But I'm not Mr. Duckworth
I am much worse when the city's mad
When your temple's leaking, with a Maxipad?
That's a pussy nigga thought, Sinister Hugo with the plot
Niggas talking jive, I get the Glock
Pop, pop, pop, keep a stock full of rocks
That be Onyx, color of skin that be honest
Ambient, I'm just rambling
About damages and I damned the shit
Like Queen Haughton as I crossed it
Holocaust it like a dyke playing lacrosse bitch
That means you can't hurt me
Now he flying like Captain Murphy
Raven Miyagi, shinobi has blessed it
Now my spirit is one with the essence
Another thug isolated
Reverse the birth so I could awaken
I live for this life, I don't live to be taken
I'm Curry, the Killer, half man, half amazing

[Hook] [x2]
Sometimes I look at niggas
Caught up in that phase
You better watch your back
Because these niggas change
If you going rep your set
Then rep the clique you claim
Elevate your mind
The third eye is your brain

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Red is the color of blood that you shed
For the diamonds of gold and the mountains of green
Green is the color of currensy
Which if you murder me, that is the thing you retrieve
Red, green, and don't forget black
Who stuck in the ghetto where niggas is cracked
The colors together so what you call that?
That's African-Americans that's caught up in the trap
Like Minnie Mouse, Benny Rat
Lucky number seven clicking to the clack
When a nigga supposed thrash, motherfucking streets ain't safe
So i keep my eyes on my back
Niggas are the snake the rat, the cat the dog
Ho, least police the pig the hog
These guys you are alliance with
Will be the cause of your downfall
They be lurking in the garden see
The pass you like pardon me
Hardly see when you conversate
It's just like Adam and Eve
Repeats itself niggas wanna take your wealth
Actin like they need some help
And leave you dealt, what I said before
These niggas just the enemy of their self
Nigga, no health

[Hook] [x3]
