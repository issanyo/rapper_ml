Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thang
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change

Feeling like I'm out of space, I'm in place I'm in place
Coming with that funky waves, hear that bass Hear that bass

My bitch look like penny proud, she got braids She got braids
Rare pretty love you bitch, not a snake Not a snake
I be focused on my shit, everyday Everyday
Stackin' hustle making chips, do not play Do not play
Get the money, make it flip, every way Every way
Gotta hustle cop a whip, escalates Escalates
Walking with a lazy limp, I get paid I get paid
Got it higher than a blimp, enemies Enemies
When she listen to my shit, I get laid I get laid
When my shit around a bitch, then get laid Then get laid

Niggas be like ? I'm a bag I'm a bag
