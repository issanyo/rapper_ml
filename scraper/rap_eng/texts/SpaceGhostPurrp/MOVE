VERSE 1:

Coming up
There was criticism
Hidden as suggestions
Fake supporters
That were really just finessing
Claiming love was the essence
Of their intentions, NO!

Nigga you faker
Than the fucking shoes
Niggas got from barbershops
And wore to school
Boy I see right through
You, you, and your bitch too
Man you know the rules

She gon' muh-fuckin choose
If she want to
There's levels to everything
And boy I mean everything!

The hoes, riches
Shit you gotta know on how to spend it
Never heard of mrs
All the hoes I'm hitting
Either won't be with me
Or just wants the dick'n
Say I ain't dependent
They say I never listen
Girl I only listen when I'm mixing

You ain't talking checks
Then you ain't talking business
You not fucking with beginners
Every since I was fifteen
Had the same team
That won't mislead
Only chase cream
Niggas know

When we dropped The Cold
They ain't think a snotty nose had a flow
Shoutout Brian Tol'
Had these hoes wanting clothes
He ain't even know we was on a roll

YEA!




HOOK:

Move move move
Move move move

X1

(you gotta go and move
If you're gon' improve)
YEA!

Move move move
Move move move

X1

(what you got to lose
What you got to lose)

Move move move
Move move move

X1

(get up and move, nigga!)

Move move move
Move move move

(nah I ain't getting left, x2)




VERSE 2:

Man, what the fuck
You know about
Being true to you
And nobody fuckin' with you

When you're fighting off depression
They tell you express it
But they never seem to get the message

Mama worried 'bout me
Had to see the reverend
Cause she sense the demons
That I'm dealing with

Your baby boy
He ain't innocent
Since he left home
He been in some shit
