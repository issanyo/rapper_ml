[Verse 1: Callon B]

We squaring circles, the paranormal don't compare to normal
Immortal, Throw the game in a portal, similar to cornhole
Numbers on the board it'll thunder it'll pour if you slumber on the lords
Think I'm Drunvalo, learned that a Moon ago
Served it on a silver platter you know where the spoon should go
Paradigm lucid flow, the dead turn heads every time I resurrect the soul
I'm my biggest threat, already high and I ain't hit it yet
Found Lucy and I hit the set, needed Kitty so I raid the vet
Fuck a day of rest, my conscious always fucking upset
Cave drawings in the K-Hole
Rehab coming out the payroll
Outfit a couple days old
Stains on the shirt came from Day Glow
Shifting shapes like play doe, funny now I'm Plato
A fucking philosopher
With a Moss Berg finna dump at an officer
Chugging the cough syrup, end the next trend give a fuck if it's popular
On alert, such frightening words
Got karma, biting the curb
From the county but I'm tight with the urb....an area cuz I'm right with the words
Fibonacci rhymes
1, 1, 2, 3, 5
See I'm 3 eyed
I-N-D-I.....G-O
Won't be denied

[Chorus: Callon B]

My eye oversees
Exposing all the oldest schemes
Show you how to mold a dream
Shift 90 degrees to see the Golden Mean x2

[Verse 2: Simple]

Ew, wicked spitter this vernacular
Causing Cardiac Arrest my rap sheets spectacular
Phony friends phoning, blood suckers buncha Draculas
Awkward offenses hopping fences in to Acuras
Doodles is off my noodles
The oodles of honesty oozes and honestly my Optometry
Sees that you fuckers are Judas and bullet proofless
These bullet points from new maneuvers and bullish looters
Got me feeling a little foolish.....
I woke up to 2 cups of Actives with cubes and soda
I whittled my wick with innocence and riddle riddles
With hollow tips to show the steps to follow down this Brick Road
Painted Yellow but them shits Gold
So I pocket a few, stop off to polish my shoes
And Politic on problems issued to you, I paid all of my dues
The metaphysical metaphors are so trivial
I mettle with metavisuals more bitter than Radicchio
And dive in her pussy my literature so critical
Liquor create quizzical fissures for the imperial
Kings noted, weed smokin
We noticed, the birds coming from cunnilingus
Then cunning Lemurs come to bring this undefeated confidence
From conquest and accomplishments thats got you walking round with your chest out
It's Mr. quick to take a pen out
And pin a Pendulum pretending to be a time bomb for these pretentious Henchmen
They not even worth a mention, and men shun me for properly predicting my pension
Prophets profited in basements around candles
Mother fuck a hand out
Seances, trading 8 bars with my uncouncious and beat boxin
The big speak softly over these harmonies as we speak properly

[Chorus: Callon B]
