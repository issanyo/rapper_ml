I know the pressure got you breathing slow
I can see the drugs in your eyes
Ain't nobody gonna judge you babe
I know you need another line
Im havin beautiful nightmares
My nigga rollin like a stone
And I be callin em daddy
But he ain't neva home
Slow dancing in the fire
Thats the devils throne
Forever singin songs
Like sierra leone
Blood diamonds on my neck
Ciggerette on my lips
Baby hold me close
Bout to empty dis clip

Got alotta sin in my wine glass
Got alotta stains on
My leoprard print coat
I been tryna make time pass
And now I'm liven in the past like a ghost

I'm gettin money til it's over
Bitch im mod I thought I told ya
Niggas mad becuase own this
I'm gettin rich
Im gettin rich
Im gettin rich

I'mma do this til it's ova
Bitch im mod I thought I told ya
Bitches mad becuase I own this
I'm gettin rich
Im gettin rich
Im gettin rich

My nigga get off that shit stop
Talkin bout that shit
That oh she looks like her
That oh she sounds like this
Well guess what I dont fuck wit
That bitch all ya'll done stole my style
I'm the smoke in the crowed the sound
Wave in the loud the tip on the black
N mild the waterfalls sound like
A round of applause I'm a star
I'm that bitch everything mod
Down to da kiss and I think I found love
But I forgot who with

Got alotta sin in my wine glass
Got alotta stains on
My leoprard print coat
I been tryna make time pass
And now I'm liven in the past like a ghost

I'm gettin money til it's over
Bitch im mod I thought I told ya
Got niggas mad becuase own this
I'm gettin rich
Im gettin rich
Im gettin rich

I'mma do this til it's ova
Bitch im mod I thought I told ya
Bitches mad becuase I own this
I'm gettin rich
Im gettin rich
Im gettin rich
