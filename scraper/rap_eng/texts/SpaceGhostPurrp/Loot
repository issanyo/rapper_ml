[Hook x2]

Look at me countin' this loot
Loot
Loot

Look at me countin' this loot
Loot
Loot

Look at me countin' this loot
Loot
Loot

Black Money World be the crew
Crew
Crew


[Verse 1]

Look at me countin' this loot
Burgundy Timbaland boots
Whole lot of money it grew
Gotta keep hustlin' too
Hatin' on niggas ain't cool
I do not follow no rules
Florida be shootin' them tools
Your daughter be fuckin' the crew
I do not follow no bitch
These bitches be suckin' my dick
Pretty as fuck and she thick
Stackin' my money and quick


[Hook x2]


[Verse 2]

[?]
Pick up a bitch and I'm right
Hop on a jet and take flight
Sippin' codeine with the Sprite
I don't believe in the hype
My nigga is high like a kite
She wanna fuck and she tight
She wanna fuck me the whole night
This is a beautiful sight
Look up to me in my swag (buy it, buy it)
Money in my Louis bag ( [?] )
Nigga be actin' an ass (fight, fight)
