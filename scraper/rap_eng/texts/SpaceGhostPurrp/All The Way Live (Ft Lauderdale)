[Chorus]
This bitch is throwed, and got ass
This bitch got hips, this bitch got thighs
This bitch here fine, this bitch here bad
She all the way live
She all the way live, all the way live, all the way live, all the way live
She all the way live, all the way live, all the way live, she all the way live
She all the way live, all the way live, all the way live, all the way live
All the way live, all the way live, all the way live, she all the way live

[Verse 1: Robb Bank$]
We kiss like a love scene, talk like we got history
And she say, "When I touch yo hand, I just think about you fingering me"
Kiss a nigga, taste that nicotine
Kung Fu grip on the past, pry it from my cold dead hands
All the times you was iggin' me could have been time you spent with me
Tat my name on that chastity belt, around that picture perfect pussy
Shit but I ain't yours to claim, Banksquiat ain't no slave
Bae my balls ain't come with your name
And you don't really wanna take it there, I ain't slap boxing, you ole' gentle fist
Open palm, ole' Neji ass nigga
Florida boy, I don't shoot no one on ones lame ass nigga, boy I'm with my dog like Kiba
And I'm at your baby mama house, tryna' freeload, she give a free blow
And in return she get a million dollar load
Nigga's mad Banks came and linked back with Steelo'
And I'm ridin' with your bitch but I ain't tell her it's a steelo'
Boy I got free lean, I got free beans, a nigga don't smoke but I got free weed
Broke ass nigga what you know about me
Babe called me on the Metro but she bout' 4G

[Chorus]
This bitch is throwed, and got ass
This bitch got hips, this bitch got thighs
This bitch here fine, this bitch here bad
She all the way live
She all the way live, all the way live, all the way live, all the way live
She all the way live, all the way live, all the way live, she all the way live
She all the way live, all the way live, all the way live, all the way live
All the way live, all the way live, all the way live, she all the way live

[Verse 2: Robb Bank$]
I'm in Gucci, with a Dertbag tee
She see that DB and that double-G
So she let all double-D hooked up phonics with double-D's, under that white tee, no problem
And my bitch in and out the mirror like Haku
And that bitch Phlo I was fucking only loved me when you was talking
Tryna' take care of another and they use you til you all used up, damn right a
Nigga mad
I wasted my time on a shone, but bet yo ass if I see that bitch again I'll rob her for all she stole
She say she see in me what them others left behind
Sit down babe tell me what's on your mind
How you want to help a nigga take care of his mama and you tired of nigga's only trying to get up in your pants
Or how you wanna get back into dance but while you been all in a nigga gauge talking bout' what you hope to gain from what you lack
All my mind been lingerin' on is how you say you never fucked raw
Now answer that

[Chorus]
This bitch is throwed, and got ass
This bitch got hips, this bitch got thighs
This bitch here fine, this bitch here bad
She all the way live
She all the way live, all the way live, all the way live, all the way live
She all the way live, all the way live, all the way live, she all the way live
She all the way live, all the way live, all the way live, all the way live
All the way live, all the way live, all the way live, she all the way live
