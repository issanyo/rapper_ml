[Verse 1]
Come and step to the master
You sensitive bastard
You think I'm a joke, huh
But my mind is faster
Fake friends is actors
It's all vice-versa
You think it's all good
But they just wanna hurt ya
Coming straight from the dark side
Spitting that homicide
Bitch I'm a pimp and a mack
Don't fuck with no hoo ride
Why you tryna be gangster
I know you a prankster
Just chill like me
And grab a bitch and spank her
Said she came from Jamaica
The people there hate her
Baby girl, this America
People here don't use razors
Similar to Darth Vader
Because I'm the God of Black
My niggas will fuck you up
And give you a heart attack

[Hook]
Damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
I don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
I just don't give a damn

[Verse 2]
Coming hard on the beat
Ain't I fuckin' it good
Hear my bass down the street
Through your whole neighborhood
See you up to no good
'Cause you thinking you slick
Fuck around with Florida
Come for you and your bitch
But I still got love
For the world and the youth
Hold it down for my town
When I'm up in the booth
See my name is not Q
But I do got the juice
Rest In Peace to Ladarius
He was trill and true
Why you worried bout me?
Better worry bout you
Sit back, relax
As I do what I do
Come through with my crew
Sippin' Alakazam
We took over the place; why?
'Cause we just don't give a damn

[Hook]
Damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
I don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
Don’t give a damn, damn-damn
Don’t give a damn
I just don't give a damn

[Outro]
Rest In Peace Jitt nigga
You already know what it is out here nigga
Straight like that my nigga
Blackland, motherfuckin' southside FLA holding it down
Raider Klan 'til I mothafuckin' die, you heard me?
Real talk nigga
