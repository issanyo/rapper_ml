[Bridge]
Aye, I said I'm coolin' I need a coat
Clean sprite you drink soap
Made your bitch hit a dirty blunt, dirty slut, all in my dertbag tee
I got OCD, everything gotta match the cup

[Hook] x4
She wrote me back and said I changed said I love you too

[Verse 1: Robb Bank$]
Young dread head saying Samo
But same old basquiat done dirtied these hoes, all of em' same old
Meet you talk then fuck you I love you screen shot how you been ain't spoke in months
So now you tryna step back to square one
But when it come to you and these green rectangles, bitches symmetrical
Fell in love with my best friend bitch
You were trying to pass her I's trying to wife her
Little smarter now than I was then dog, take it with a grain of salt
Throw it on the wound the pain may help you learn a thing or two
The one puttin' that knife in your back that's the same bitch you trying to spoon
Two phones, still can't communicate with a woman
Still rapping bout' four months ago and you told me that you loved me
And girl you been down for so long, I'm serious take that mind down south
Take a little breather before I beat ya'
Make a ho tell Broward, at least you ain't pay for no feature bitch!
Never raw dog like a compliment
SS bitch, know I got Drake hot
Smart Stunna Nazi young savage, but I could never ride a Volkswagen
I'm one deep in that foreign boy, that passenger seat still warm
Since you've been gone ignoring my calls
Set my navigation to talk to me
Bitch, I'm that nigga
Still that nigga
Been that nigga, mane fuck yo' nigga mane
Fuck your decisions fuck fucking me and then goin' back and fucking that nigga
But let me stop right there man
A wedding ring promised that I wouldn't fashion through your dirty laundry
But at the same damn time, just a Future reference
I don't need no "just checkin' up iMessages"
Shit I remember like the first time I hit the lean, I seen you, you seen me
It's been a minute, so let me crack the Panamera tint
Just so you can get a glimpse of where you could've been seen

[Verse 2: Lofty305]
She say Her new nigga an athlete, but she crossed over to the MVP
Just tryin' to put you on game, why she never at your games
Nigga I'm a sportsman myself just popped three footballs, touchdown
Young pimpin' gon' fuck around and turn a fuck nigga into rebound
Where yo' money at, you ain't making no sense
Them niggas say I changed, they ain't making no sense
They be like where yo' money at, you ain't making no sense
Them niggas say I changed, they ain't making no sense, yeah

[Hook: Lofty305] x4

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Robb Bank$]
Clean face, you tried to give these pussy niggas space
Finally got a taste of my own medicine
Now you want me to pull you up out the paint
Yeah I'll pull you up out the paint
Get in the paint, get in the paint
Young Basquiat my nigga, get in the paint
Tell that nigga to get in the paint
Said get in the paint, fuck nigga
