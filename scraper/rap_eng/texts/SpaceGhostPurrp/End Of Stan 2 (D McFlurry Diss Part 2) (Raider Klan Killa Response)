My bitch ass fatter than your bitch ass
Her ass bigger than your whole career

How the fuck you gettin' money?
I see why you hate your life
Nigga, you was born bummy
And you have the nerve to rock a grill

Boy, your fucking grill big as fuck, like some brass knuckles
Nigga teeth stay poking out like a belt buckle

Raider Klan be the set nigga
Pussy nigga, that's your only hit
Now the pussy nigga fallin' off
Cause his video ain't blow
Who you think you is, Travis Scott?
Hoppin' 'round like a broke hoe
Nigga better mind his business
Hit him up and hit the witness
Feeling like I'm Peyton Manning
'Cause a nigga always with me
Boy, your music so confusing
If I play it 'round some bitches
You gon' run away the bitches
'Cause your music sound like bitchin'
You be fuckin' groupie bitches
I be fuckin' model bitches
You be shopping at the city [?]
With them dusty Bugle Boy pants
When I met you, boy, you was a fan
You a bum, eating out the can
Pussy nigga gotta give it up
Lame nigga, you are not a Stan

[Bridge]

Death Row, man, Black Money Boyz, man

Taking all these niggas' bitches
Takin' all these niggas' hoes
Gettin' to that money, nigga
