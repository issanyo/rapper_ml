I'm stickin', this is how we stickin'
When I'm in the strip club, I be stickin'
Stickin', B.R.K. we stickin'
Fucking all these bad bitches I be stickin'
Stickin', this is how we stickin'
When I'm in the strip club, I be stickin'
Stickin', B.R.K. we stickin'
Fucking all these bad bitches I be stickin'

[Verse 1: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Imma' get this money, Imma' get this dough
I don't pay for pussy, but I sell her she my ho
You already know, bitch I'm getting rich
I be throwing money, but them strippers on my dick
Flex on a hater, flex on a ho
Making bitches mad, don't be sad let it go
Drop it on the floor, make that ass show
Tight skin, dress, with a face like J-Lo
Stickin' with my bro, he smokin' on that dro'
This shit is like a movie, bougie bitches love my flow
Raider to the Klan, Inky why you had to go?
Rest in peace to Inky, leave you stinky on the floor
Oh, my, motherfucking god
Space, Ghost, Purrp, fuck me hard
Riding hella fast down the fucking boulevard
Getting dome in the front seat, got a motherfucker like, lord

[Hook]
I'm stickin', this is how we stickin'
When I'm in the strip club, I be stickin'
Stickin', B.R.K. we stickin'
Fucking all these bad bitches I be stickin'
Stickin', this is how we stickin'
When I'm in the strip club, I be stickin'
Stickin', B.R.K. we stickin'
Fucking all these bad bitches
