(Six shots motherfucker)

On the block, ten toes
Up n' down, hit 'em low
Runnin' laps with the dope
Never leave without my pote
In the ditch, dug a hole
Go to war, heavyweight
Rambo, fuck it forward
Six gang up in this hoe, bitch

(Taken off the motherfuckin' set)
(Fuckin' hatin' ass bitch)

Doo-wop [?], hold the weight
Make the fuckin' earth shake
[?]
Run a lap in the rain
Thinkin' this a fuckin' game
Real shit, spittin' flame
On Twitter talkin' shit
But you won't say my name, I'm on 'em
Bitch, I ain't frontin' 'bout my shit
Stay gunnin'
Catch a case, ain't nothin'
On sight, you stay runnin'
[?]
Better get to fuckin' duckin'
Unload the clip
When I'm done with six shots
I ain't fuckin' with you fakes
All gas, no brakes
Got me jockin' from the Jakes
211, got food up on my plate
Fuck the case I had to give about [?]
Real shit
[?]
If they wanna fuckin' hate

(Taken off the motherfuckin' set)
(Fuck with none of yall 2016 and shit)

Ain't the one, to be guessin'
Better count the fuckin' blessings
Fuckin' with a smith n wesson
Ain't testin'
No more flexin'
