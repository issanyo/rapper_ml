[Intro]

[Hook x2: Yung Simmie]
I'ma grind, I'mma grind
I ain't tryna go broke [x2]
I'ma spend that shit and flip that shit
And get it right back [x2]

[Verse: Yung Simmie]
Man I'm hungry as fuck, I'm thinking 'bout bucks
Man I'm like Lebron James coming down for the dunk
How you feel, keep it real, better get it off your chest
I just slipped on my nights, yeah I'm coming for the check
Nothing less than a vet, I ain't tryna' go broke
Amber London got the wheel while I roll up dope
Cause a nigga gotta smoke
Pedal to the metal lets go

[Verse 2: Amber London]
This is for my niggas living tax free
Spit the crack, 4 5th in the back seat
Streets get cold so a bitch gotta pack heat
Got the .44 aimed at your ass cheek, act sweet
All black like a nun
Bitch got the gun, got to run
Hot like the sun when I come
Bitch I'm so throwed of that lean
All gold on, gone off that green
But I'm 'bout green cause a bitch gotta get it
You niggas lames but my flows be a acidic
Holla if you wit, mane fuck that forget it
You can smell the kush before a bitch even lit it
Gotta get on and put on for my city
So I can get paid and put my momma in a Bentley
Niggas gon' hate, yeah these fuck niggas envy
Yeah I got a pussy, I ain't got nun in it
Niggas don't trust when a bitch be acting friendly
That's why, I'm all about my stacks
Posted in the back, I be smoking on that sack
Niggas know it's hard to find, a bitch that's on her grind
Tryna' get that money and my, I'm still gon' tote that nine

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nell]
Bitch I'mma grind
Thinking 'bout a lick, I got that money on my mind
Bum rush yo' shit, cause I gotta get mine
Hitters incline
Running with gorilla through dungeons and whip vines
That's coming to rip spines
Living by the code
If money is motive then let me get it and go
We paper chasing the road
Dough Dough lets go on the indo
My niggas ride it like ten fold

[Verse 4: Dough2x]
Game remain the same
But the faces change
Lincolns turn to Hamilton's
I know them by name
Mind my frame, soul plane, get paid
Get laid, get blazed
Money is the motivation, so I motivate
Calculate currency from Miami to overseas
Bank respect me like Frank
Paper stick to me, like paint
Your bitch on my dick, you can't tell me she ain't
I'ma get a meal today, you can't tell me I can't
I just pray when I pull up in that Benz, you gon' faint
A trick'll get hit with this K
Cause if it's beef I swear I only know one way
Every dog has it's day

[Hook]
