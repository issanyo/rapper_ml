[Intro]
Never trust a ho
You can't trust a bitch
Never trust a ho
You can't trust a bitch
I'm always on your mind
Let that ho know, let that ho know
When you think about me, you be paranoid, all the time
Let that bitch know
I'm always on your mind
Let that ho know, let that ho know
When you think about me, you be paranoid, all the time
Let that bitch know, let that bitch know
I'm always in your head
Let that ho know, let that ho know
Tossing and turning, can't go to bed
Let that bitch know, let that bitch know

[Verse 1]
Let me get the fuck out this place
Niggas and hoes all in my face
Leather on like '98 Ma$e
Back to court, 'cause I caught me a case
Bullshit that I seen everyday
At the bar, got to get me a chase
She a star, you can see it in her face
In my car, 'cause she got hella taste
Legs soft with the Coke bottle waist
Stock go hard, like an 808 bass
Time is like a high nigga eating cake
It go by fast, like the way to Ricky Lake
Cuban links, I keep two on floss
Phonk in my soul, like Luther Vandross
Get lost, stop calling my phone
Do me a favor, just leave me alone
Yeah, I'm young, but wise, I'm not dumb
You got to be wise in the state I came from
Not from the slums, but I'm from the Southside
Of F.L.A., where the OG's reside
Let me wipe the tears from my eyes
It's been two years since my nigga Jitt died
If I cry then you should know why
All that pain I can't hold inside

[Hook]
Paranoia, paranoia
Paranoia
Paranoia, paranoia
Paranoia
Paranoia, paranoia
Paranoia
Paranoia, paranoia
Paranoia

[Verse 2]
Paranoia, kicking in
Johnny Cage, trust this
Not here, nowhere
Compatible with girls with long hair
Don't care, what you say
The lies you create, everyday
I pray, my way
By the way, Rest In Peace Jam Master J
Uh, I'm insecure, but I can't help that
Talking 'bout I'm tripping, but I'm not
Niggas want that
Little itty bitty body, you a hottie
So don't get mad when I snap for a hobby
In the lobby checking in, stepping in
Who do I see? My ex-woman with the next man
Think a nigga gon' hurt when I see fool?
Bet she hurting right now 'cause my boo
Look way-way better than my last bitch
Baby who is she? Baby girl, she my last bitch
Aston Martin, let me buy this
Never had a whip, but I wanna drive this
Try this, Aliz√©-Sizzurp mix
As I play Blackland, black lipstick
Deep thought from the sound got your body lit
You paranoid now, let me kiss the kitty clit

[Hook]
Paranoia, paranoia
Paranoia
Paranoia, paranoia
Paranoia
Paranoia, paranoia
Paranoia
Paranoia, paranoia
Paranoia
