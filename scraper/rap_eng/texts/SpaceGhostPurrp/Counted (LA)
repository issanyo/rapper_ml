[Verse 1: Robb Bank$]
Shawty swing my way, and the sex ain't as good as you made it out to be
No one special like I need to play the story
Mowed over this gold for all y'all
Boy you mean to tell me, thought your bitch wouldn't cheat?
The ho beat my dick like paper over paper
Cover up my paper like the smart kid I'm giving you a test nigga
Boy I was PMSin' the period's almost over
I ain't got to see you after this we all got different schedules nigga
High school I fucked the baddest bitch at my high school
After high school I still had obligations like a man, but we cool
I'm cooler than the draft that yo man practiced eating out of his hand like a Giraffe
While I'm thinking what I'm finna' do dinner, and babe pick, like the draft
I just want that bitch that used to text during class
JK we ain't wifing these hoes, JK but bitch we ain't friends to you I'm just boy
Compound words ain't to be blurted out, she left her man to fuck a noun
Now move your mouth slow like you tryna' sound it out
Money I been spending, bonds I severed
Relationships getting worse boy, ties getting surfed
And aye counting, counting, I been counting
So let me give a update to all the niggas still bumping counting

[Hook]
One year til' we dead my nigga, two twins done counted all the bread my nigga
A hundred thousand racks I spent my nigga
Peekin' outside where I reside only result fire
Oh nigga, oh nigga they like Bank$ you different now, I'm like oh nigga
Oh nigga, oh nigga what I said "Calendars is dead forget about that ho nigga"

[Verse 2: Robb Bank$]
And boy you with her now, but that bitch still mine
Still got iPhone icon quality JPG's of that OOH!
These pussy niggas look spooked, boy BOO!
I'm inside that pink like Gotenks so I call her Buu
And nigga you can take the credit Hercule
Mrs. Satan done seen angels, tell you bout it nigga you wouldn't believe boy
Me, live in a glass house, I'm gon' see and expose you
Bitch I got a secret for every nigga with a gold tooth
Ain't shit you can say to me, bury me a nigga, at least I look like zero
Wish i was still 4 years old and my daddy was still my hero
I never lied though, met a Zoe at 12 years old
That was daddy to me, taught me everything that momma couldn't
And all of them infidelities cut up my former guardian
Couldn't bare to look at us
The alternative move momma, lil' bro, and me went down to the sea
Ask him if he raised a savage I bet he say, "It wasn't me"
18 years of the work face gated through the hustle
Still a Woodside nigga with North Lauderdale muscle
Kicked out of Coral Springs High, dropped out of Dave Thomas
Now my lil' bitch in college hollerin' "go back to school"
Talkin' my ear off bout how much she love her class
Leave her on campus, way she make that shit sound better be Degrassi
Annoying as JT cause she young as JV and keep with that gossip
And I get Rickâ€™s book an tear a page
40 put you in a wheelchair make you think about it after like
"Nothing Was The Same", you lil' Drakes
These action figure ass niggas look bout it but they break
Don't like me, scared of the new nigga, I'm Buzz Lightyear
And they just put me in a play and I took over all of your space
I fucked y'all up, I said I fucked y'all up, burn y'all boys, now you just sex toys
You left niggas with no face boy won't come back and visit his people
But he can't come, Barbie dolls y'all pussy with no features
These niggas on Instagram and think they thumbin' through faces
2Phone made yo bitch hit airplane mode for the dick
Flyer than a tsuchikage in this bitch, ya lil' bitch
All my niggas out here living good smoking big blunts
Eating away at big breast like the cancers spreading
While I got that mosquito leg, mostquito bite lady bug on my arm
That you just can't seem to hit
