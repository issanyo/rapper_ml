[Intro]
Really? (Throughout whole song)
He's open... Chicago with the lead
Timeout Utah... 5.2...

[Hook]
Yeah they call me Muney Jordan call me SpaceGhostPurrp
If you fuckin' round with me I'll leave you in the dirt (x5)
I'll leave you in the dirt (4)

[Verse 1: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Really? Damn (Repeated in the background)
SpaceGhostPurrp I run this shit
I got swagger in this bitch
Throw that nigga and the bitch
Fuck these hoes I'm tryna get rich
SpaceGhostPurrp your girl want me
Space nigga shit, I love to sip lean
Up in the club, we rollin' up trees
Strip club hoes is dancing on me
SpaceGhostPurrp they call me Muney Jordan
Hundred dollar bills, you know I stay scorin'
Gold Trojan Magnum, call that bitch a trophy
Put it on my dick and bitch you can hold it
Hold it, mold it, shape it, control it
Sippin on some lean my world in slow motion
Bitch I'm so wavy, feel like an ocean
Roll that doobie up and bitch get to smoking
