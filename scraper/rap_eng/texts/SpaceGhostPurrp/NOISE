Noise is the motherfucking feeling/ Fuck my angst it’s the pain I’m revealing/ been popped out the womb out the pavement since children/ been at 152 chilling tryin to make a livin/ it’s hard and its only getting harder/ arteries prolly clogged/ should’ve never started/ should’ve hugged my momma more/ never should’ve parted/ ways/ should’ve started with better grades and a boquete/ ok we gonna be ok /better days/ one way/ car crash/ we wait/ I fade/ drain the chitter chatter I really rather get a better batter to bat it up than simply stand there mad as fuck/ gang here with bands and we add it up/ math ain’t luck/ habits and bud/ tactics manage the drugs/ calculated reactions patching buds/ it’s just us/ I wanna die more than I wanna live sometimes but the closer I get to my last breath the more I want mine/ the more I want time/ the more I want health instead of wealth and shine but I see it/ believe it/ I need it//
The deepest/ feeling / I sieze it/ it’s creeping these demons I can never beat them just be them and hope to one day free them yuh

Noise is the motherfucking feeling/ out the roof through the motherfucking ceiling/ all this trauma gotta have sum meaning/ caught between love and reason in a coliseum with columns reading carpe diem/ god gotta lead em/ out of they suffering/ come from within
All that’s troubling/ juggling hustling as the wonder kid tumbling down the walls in front of him fuck a hundred bricks I got me/ all I need/ is weed and a lil more me/ Lil more OG with game leaf maybe a sail breeze with paid fees lately been grateful for what made me
Living this life is kinda difficult
Sinning still praying for a miracle
Life is waves ride them intervals
Even the smallest step is pivotal

Noise is the motherfucking feeling/ out my room to the mother fucking beacon/ been freeing my mind thinking out of the box of time/ cause n affect/ u get shot and u stuck pressed and u check/ u got the weapon with u/ closest thing to Christ that God could give u/ a chance/ at sum defense/ money well spent/ to stand against/ an imminent end/ u might not be living again
It’s tough bitch cuz it’s all of the fuck its
Hoping I could live in abundance with a strong independent women in a sundress it’s versatile
U can’t purchase a smile but u can search in denial if its worth to work in the dirt for a while to end up hurt and senile/ no one deserves birth just to be filed
I found my way and I found it alone
Never needed a break never needed a loan
Feet to the cement I made it my own
Never leaved it stayed till it was grown
It’s Kendall shit/ bird road/ forty second shit/ fuck censorship/ get a mentor and learn to flip/ fuck the bitch huh

Noise is the mother fucking feeling/ u ain’t vibe if u slide to the precinct/ living with do or die/ victimless crime/ indifferent to eyes/ such a difficult time/ it’s all in my mind/ u ain’t feel rear view/new route/everyday/ bricks flew/ got through/ all at my pace/ fuck you/ my rules/ made me this way/ I knew/ I’d use/ all of her grace/ y’all is hysterical could compare to a vegetable expect the expendable to do nothing commendable y’all is stupid ain’t no on one u foolin/ cruising y’all out for a bruising/ I choose to be this cool on a beat/ u choosing defeat/ y’all new to the east/ we fueling the beast/ we used to the feast/we shrooms plus DMT infused with the heat

Noise is the motherfucking feeling/ I ain’t tired I’m Kevin Gates conquering my demons/ constantly leading/ my self from self treason/ y’all opinions keep y’all breathing/ while death got me intrigued with freedom/ not seeking/ a peace of anything/ finding peace through indo leaf/ I entertain/ thoughts of better things/ to offer everything/ to my offspring to foster a thought of godliness/ self implosion a need to start screaming/ emotions different eyes divide competing/ noise in my mind confined I feel it/ through u I see me I know I can’t be it/ broken self always felt so uneasy/ now I need weed a and WiFi for leafly/ in time it’s all time that is retreating/ maybe it’ll fade or worsen without meaning
Noise is the motherfucking feeling
