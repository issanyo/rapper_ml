[Intro:]
This beat is so fucking hard
Like, Where I'm at I'm just chilling baby
Midwest Celtics
Lets do it

[Hook:]
I'm so fucking gone
I'm so fucking gone
Baby pour that lean on me
Baby suck it off of me
Because, Im so fucking gone

[Verse 1:SpaceGhostPurrp]
Yo I feel invincible
She saying Purrp I'm missing you
So shawty bring yo ass to my crib
Promethazine all on my lips
She love me cause I'm icy man
And imma make her say my name (say my name)
Slow motion catch me rolling in the whip
Yeah nigga you know just how I live
How I live

[Bridge:]
The lean keep calling me (calling me, calling me)
The motherfucking lean keep calling me

[Hook]
