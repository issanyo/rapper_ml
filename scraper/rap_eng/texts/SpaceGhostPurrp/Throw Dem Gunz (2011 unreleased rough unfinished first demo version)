Sewers to the slums where I'm from
Yeah I'm gettin' dumb
Yeah I'm feelin' numb when that sherm fill up in my lungs

My swagger actin' foul, blackin' out
Roofie up my absinthe in the club before I stagger out
Live or die, Iâ€™d rather take the latter route
Yo, take the ladder route
Rope around my neck and kick the ladder out

There's no need to drag it out
Ugly mane and SGP
Blowin on the swisher sweet
Percocet, promethazine
Bin a thirty fuckin' fiends
Baking soda recipes

Murder is my specialty
You know I make them recipes
Demons in my mental, armed to the dental
When I throw my money up, the rain is torrential

If you got big guns throw 'em up
Break that hoe, split that dutch
Stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
We don't give a fuck
Got some scribble let 'em know
Stack yo money, sniff that blow
Tell me how that pussy hittin' bitch
You know I keeps it low
