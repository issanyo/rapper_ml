[Hook]
I'mma keep bringing the phonk
Nigga, I'mma keep bringing the phonk
And you niggas can't stop me

[Verse]
Look how she popping that ass
Well she popping and twerking it fast
And you know she all on me
Got to get straight to the cash
Got to hustle, get off of your ass
Got to make that monopoly
Putting these niggas on blast
Pimp shit will always last
I'mma pass that ho to Rocky
Keeping my mind on the math
Intelligent when I'm in the lab
Scientifically, I'm cocky
Profession is all in my graph
Rap niggas be making me laugh
Autographing Versace
Erection flow hard like a giant
And she caught a nut real quick
Call that ho Jeremy Shockey
Chillin' with a Puerto Rican
English is what she's barely speakin'
'Cause I make her say Papi
Yeah, I got that pussy leakin'
And the Phonk got her body tweakin'
Ain't no way you can stop me

[Hook]
I'mma keep bringing the phonk
Nigga, I'mma keep bringing the phonk
And you niggas can't stop me
