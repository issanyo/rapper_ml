Aye man, aye, a nigga know what it is, man, man I ain’t gotta- I ain’t gotta tell nigga the name, nigga know who this is I’m already talking right now, Free Chxpo, Free ?, Free KO, you know the six running shit

Uh, Yeah, aye, aye, aye

[Hook: Thouxanbanfauni x 2]
I’m in the island to these niggas
Guala in my britches
I don’t even holla at these bitches
These niggas some snitches
You claim you rich, then where yo riches
I can’t fuck with fishes
Turn a basic bitch to bad
My animorph religion
And I don’t need friends
I just need them bands
My gender so heavy
The tech on me, no time for hands
I’m gone buys some new rims
And I’m gone cop me some land
In a love and hate relationship
With cash you wouldn’t understand

[Verse 1: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Shitting on a stupid bitch
With a name that start with a K
Bitch you lame, running game
But I ain’t even fall for that motherfucking shit
Imma laugh at her face, when I’m shitting on this bitch
I should slide past that ho with a pretty ass bitch
Sitting in a Lamborghini, while my ho blow a kiss
And her home girl like ho look what you miss
Girl you coulda had a boss but you blew the whole shit
Never fuck wit a bitch that want you for yo clout
Cause you know she ain’t gone, but her ass gone be on
But a nigga like me got my clout back
Now I’m shitting on this ho, at the club pulling up
Sitting on another ho wit a name ho that start wit a G
Making it rain on South Beach, in the club
Me and my niggas throwing dubs
I’m shitting on my old bitches, I don’t show no love

[Verse 2: Terrance Escobar]
I fucked on yo daughter
Straight slaughtered that pussy
These white hoes on go
She dancing like a go-go
Bunky trap phone
We trapping boost mobile
Lil Motorola mixed up with the yola
Fuck a name brand
I get dressed off my rep
Christian Loubies mixed with Truees and Louie’s
I Skrrrrrt off with thotties I took from your Fefe
And stay hella clean when I’m blowing on tree leaf
Smoking Afghanistan
Pack daily like candy man
Strapped up like Atlantastan
I spit that lingo
Chips stacking like pringles
Shout out my migos
They calling me gringo
Geeked the fuck up when I’m up on the scene
Niggas is dying and killing for cream
I spit that trap shit, I’m chasing my dreams
45 extensions and chops with the beams
Sexy lil bitch trying fuck on my team
I’m hella fly, I need me some wings
I’m mixing up the designer, designer
I’m kicking shit heavy, I need a recliner
She emo as fuck, and the Gucci eyeliner
Run to the money I never get tired
Juuging yo city, hit a lick like a pirate
Juuging yo city, hit a lick like a pirate

[Bridge]
Balling, yeah you know I’m balling
Catch me overseas up in my threes You know I’m balling
I’m balling, yeah you know I’m balling
Try to find ? 85 my bitches balling
We wiling, We wiling
We wiling, we wiling
Try to find ? 85 my bitches balling
