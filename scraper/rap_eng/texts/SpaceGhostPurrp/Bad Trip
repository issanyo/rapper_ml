[Hook: Count Wienr]
I've got a bad trip - I've got a bad trip
I can't feel fucking face and can't stand on my feet
Devil bitch brings shit, I'm unpacking new brick
She slides down to hips, feel her lips on my dick

[Verse: Count Wienr]
My cash flow rises up and my life is okay
So much blunts, so much lean, I'm 'bout to lay into grave
Now let's rock, get this shit, every day is like Sunday
Making things, check it out, every day i am grindin'
You be like smoke and talk: "Beamer, Bentley or Benz?"
I'm 'bout to keep myself alive without thinking of friends
You smoke ten blunts, then you tryna make a speech of your trends
So I be like "Ugh!" - that's all that my speech now contents
You say I'm flexin' â€” you are not even close
I fucking lost my mind cause I fall into overdose
Money over hoes, but I need no money
I have to wake up inside and it's not even funny
I'm calling my shawty, I'm thinking who I be
All this voices in my head like these shadows around me
All this bitches surround me and I see them smiley
All these tentacles and horns are about to blind me

[Hook: Count Wienr]
I've got a bad trip - I've got a bad trip
I can't feel fucking face and can't stand on my feet
Devil bitch brings shit, I'm unpacking new brick
She slides down to hips, feel her lips on my dick
