[Hook]
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate

[Verse 1]
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Niggas better get it straight
And worry about theyself
Because I don't care what the niggas say
When I walk up in the place
I notice them watching me, plotting me
See the hate up in they face
That's why a nigga got to pray
I'm watching these demons and devils
As I kill them with the 'K
Brraatt-tat, now watch it spray
I'm murking them shawty
Hurting they body
And lyrically, I do not play
And mentally, I fucking rape
With pistols and .40s
Shooting the party
Pop-pop, shot up the place
Ah-ah, watch what you say
Speaking sideways with subliminals
Them niggas there gon' make you lay
Player hating gon' make you pay
Respect every man
Do what you can
To make it every single day

[Hook]
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate

[Verse 2]
Look around the world
All you see is evil people
I'm focusing on better things and staying equal
My sequel is something similar to an eagle
Flyer than most, in the sky, Evel Knievel
Illegal shit always come up in society
Momma say "Get a job" but they won't hire me
Inspire me, so I can be the best that I can be
Holding it down underground, ain't no stopping me
I'm properly putting on for my believers
And if you don't understand, you'll receive a
Gift as I lift your mind up with power
Elevate with the fate, and devour the enemies
That all try to be the friend of me's
Never trust your friends, only your kin of me's
My mind always stressed
Will I ever get killed, 'cause one day I'mma be the best

[Hook]
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
Only pie niggas hate
That's why I stay to myself
Because I always must elevate
