Yeah I think I’m better dead
I don’t give a fuck about the words I never said
I’m better dead


I don’t want the riches
I don’t love these bitches
I just wanna live it to the limit
Like sid vicious
I’m livin with no purpose
Besides my beats and verses
I’m sick of feeling worthless
I’ll End it all ian curtis
Put the shotty to my brain
Sniff cocaine and then go bang
QMC the black cobain
Except I’m livin with no fame
So I’ll be crashin like darby
While throwin trash at the army
I had a passionate path
Now I’m Clyde without bonnie

Yeah I think I’m better dead
I don’t give a fuck about the words I never said
I’m better dead

Bangin marilyn manson cause both my parents harrasin
But my dad he’s phantom and I ain’t seen him in years
Mama sad and shes screaming until she's weeping in tears
Got me mad and I’m heated until I’m steamin from ears
Had a dance with the devil and thought my dreams would appear
Just made my demons my peers and got me fiendin for beer
Yeah, This music I utilize til the day that its eulogized
Chasing dreams like it’s do or die don’t catch em it’s Suicide



Yeah I think I’m better dead
I don’t give a fuck about the words I never said
I’m better dead
