[Verse 1]
Sewers to the slums where I'm from
Yeah I'm gettin' dumb
Yeah I'm feelin' numb when that herb fill up in my lungs
My swagger actin' foul, blackin' out
Roofie up my absinthe in the club, before I stagger out
Live or die, I’d rather take the latter route (yup)
Take the ladder route
Rope around my neck and kick the ladder out
There’s no need to drag it out
Ugly Mane and SGP
Blowing on the swisher sweet
Percocet promethazine
Finna serve these fuckin' fiends
Baking soda recipies
Murder is my specialty
You know I make 'em rest in piece
Demons in my mantle
Armed to the dental
When I throw my money up
The rain is torrential

[Hook]
If you got big guns throw 'em up
Break that ho, split that dutch
Stick 'em up, bitch, stick 'em up
We don't give a fuck
Got some scribbles let 'em know
Stack yo money, sniff that blow
Tell me how that pussy hittin' bitch
You know I keeps it low
