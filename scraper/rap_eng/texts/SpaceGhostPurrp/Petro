[Intro]

[Hook x7: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Petro shit, I petro
I petro bitch, I petro

[Verse: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Hella fans, they marching for autographs
Evidence, I hid that so I can laugh
Tell a friend, your main bitch gave me a bath
Hella wet, I'm a vet so I defeat the crowds
Heaven sent, bless a nigga with all the steez I got
Irrelevance, I can see that all you niggas not relevant at all
Yeah I ball, for real just give me meals, I'm givining you niggas chills
Bitches be popping pills, they rolling like windmills
And keeping they body hot, I'm telling them how I feel
She melting, baby you felt it
I can't lay up in pussy though, I ain't Raymond Felton
Gotta get to the green, keep it on me like Celtics
If a nigga say fuck me, I know that he jealous
All my niggas smoke Petro, I know that you smell it
Niggas still using Metro, my nigga you failing

[Hook x7]

[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Verse 2, yeah nigga I do this
Just left Chase, now I'm finna get stupid
Ain't got time to even stress bout no bullshit
Hit my fool up cause I know he'll shoot shit
In that Timberland boot shit, been on that since school you foolish
Lame niggas do what lame niggas do
You a fuck boy nigga and yo clique pussy too
And I know what you bout to do, talk shit like a little bitch that's all you do
Yo bitch said hit me up, I'mma call you too
Hit me on the late night tip, now she coming through
What you wanna do?
Rap game nothing, all I see is dollar signs you ain't seeing nothing
Steady hustling, I'm the main discussion
I'm so sick that the nigga got disgusted
