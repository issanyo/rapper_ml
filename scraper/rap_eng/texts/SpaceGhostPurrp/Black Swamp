[Intro]

G-G-G-Get the fuck out

[Verse 1: Michael Christmas]

And now my hair got me lookin’ like the Versace Medusa
And if that offer ain’t higher than fifty racks you gone lose us
It might sound arrogant to ya but what’s a nigga to do
When all I got is my family and all they need is some loot
This isn’t no joke, this isn’t a game
I ain’t finna smile bitch this isn’t the Wayans
I pissed off some niggas this year I ain’t play’n
These niggas ain’t hearin’ no sorrys from me
And I hope that shit you be talkin’ is quality
‘Cause honestly, I’m proud to be
The one with the dick in your mouth, pause
Bring it back now it’s time to spray
Women and children gone witness
The king take the throne
I can see in the distance
I pull out my rifle my aim is relentless
I feel like I play for the ’91 Pistons
A bad boy bitch, we the champs now
Tell a bad bitch to come and take a damn bow
Bitch I won’t apologize
Awkward nigga y’all demise
Christmas finna Columbine
And suicide with concubines
Figured it would take five years
For me to get that paper up
Gives me four years to go dumb
And put my name on peoples tongue
See I think I’m John C. Reilly
Til’ I go in like Kakashi
Use that Sharingan to body
‘Til I’m higher than Hokages
I need hoes that look like Sade
All this stress gone get me sloppy
I clock in like this the lobby
Y’all ain’t working, fucking Tommy’s

[Hook]

Ugh, so kill or be killed nigga
Ugh, so kill or be killed nigga
Ugh, so kill or be killed nigga
Ugh, so kill or be killed

[Verse 2: Darius De’Nail]

OK I thought about it, figured it out
Decided to follow my choice
Roll up this icky
And steal every niggas bitch by usin’ my voice
Swore to Rah not to puncture the kitty unless it's moist
But then I Obelisk torment her in any room of my choice
It's so stupid how these niggas do it
Crucial how y'all niggas losing
You can try to Russell the facts
But at the end I'm still Rick the Rubin
All my niggas they stupid
And how we acting is a nuisance
Never fuck with the same hoes
Cause I got an addiction to that new shit
This is childish
Let's say I'm fucking and I'm poopin
And I'm bustin on y'all troopers
Who think I'm the type to get cool wit
Yeah that's right that's Cool Whip
And I prefer my balls ain't blue bitch
Straight gum action, straight gum action
You would of thought these hoes was toothless
