[Verse 1]
The Osiris of the underground
The young underrated motherfucker
Who came through with the flame sound
Now they know his name now
Young real-minded
Hoes reject him, now they wanna claim now
Reaching for the fame now
While the hating-ass niggas try to fuck up his wave
And his name now
Living like a slave now
Working eight hours a day
No pay
Still trying to get paid now
Time to get laid now
In the East Pyramid suite
Lemonade in the shade now
Nigga got it made now
What can I say?
You should pray
To me and be my slave now
I don't have to wait now
The pussy is top notch
Like butter scotch
Then I slay now
Baby girl say "wow"
'Cause I'm the best she ever had
Like her dad
So the bitch wanna stay now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Intellectual, with eight styles
I could switch it all up
Like the niggas who all starred on "8 mile"
Hustling through Paypal
As they cop the medical online
I ship it through the mail now
Living here in hell now
Known as the motherfuckin' Earth
AKA the fucking world now
Living like a squirrel now
Got trees and girl squirrels
So we trying to catch a nut now
Living like a slut now
Fucking only clean goddesses
Niggas out here fucking mutts now
Passion in my heart now
'Cause I love music so much
So I guess we getting married now
Like Mariah Carey now
We belong together
Me and music forever
In every weather now
Flyer than a feather now
If a girl wanna settle down
Then I'll never, ever let her down

[Hook]
