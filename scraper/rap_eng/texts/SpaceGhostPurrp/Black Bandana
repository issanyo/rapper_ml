[Intro: Skip Rage]
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black lipstick, black everything
Black bandana, bandana, bandana

[Hook: Skip Rage]
The ratchet ass bitches, they can eat a dick
A trill ass bitch is who I'm fucking with
Black lipstick, black everything
Black bandana, and she rep my gang
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black lipstick, black everything
Black bandana, bandana, bandana

[Verse 1: Skip Rage]
My empress lady keeping it trill, gripping that three-eighty
Ready to lock and load if a nigga try to play me
My gangsta boo, bumping that Three 6 up in my coupe
Dru Down, Pimp C, get my nigga Snoop
Them ratchet ass bitches they can eat a dick
A trill ass bitch is who I'm fucking with
Black lipstick, black everything
Black bandana, and she rep my gang
Colt 45, she crack that brew, right
Timbaland's on, that pretty goon type
Mackin' it with the fella's, she smoking hella blunts
Sitting on my trunk, blowing smoke into the moonlight
That perfect setting, that picture perfect, that Mona Lisa
Rare bitch, I dare a bitch to come try and see her
Them party pills got her feeling like she on a mill
Looking like an easy mission, so I'm going in for the kill
Born in the crack era, why you think I'm crazy?
Grew up in the 90's, but the 2000's they made me, yeah
Party and sipping lean up with my thugs
We under ground, fuck the club, and we all yelling
Ain't no party without a bitch doing molly
Ain't no party without a bitch doing, we saying
Ain't no party without a bitch doing molly
Ain't no party, that's what we doing

[Bridge: Skip Rage]
Black, black, bandana, black, black, bandana
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black bandana, black, black, bandana
Black lipstick, black everything
Black bandana, bandana, bandana

[Verse 2: Telli of NinjaSonik]
I'm too legit
Drunk as a fish and I'm feeling this bitch, and I run it to my nigga Skip
He pulling my coat, just some hoes on the blow, and he tell me they ready to dip
And you know I'm with it, tell them hoes hurry up before my A.D.D. kick in
All we trying to do is get high and kick it
Realest nigga breathing is in your vision
Niggas can't see us, need a new prescription
But listen, my
Black bandana, is stuffed in my pocket
That thirteen-three is all I see, might as well, we get it popping
You could front if you want, this is not what you want, get your top, popping tags, we shopping
We riding through hits and just get deposits, and then we splurge the profit
I'm bossing up
It's kind of tough cause even me to you, and you know what?
It'll be a cold day in hell before we don't come and turn up

[Verse 3: Skip Rage]
Beast mode, beast mode
NYC nigga, eastcoast
Westcoast be my steelo
My back down, head cracked, nigga that's Cee Lo
Sipping on Clicquot, straight out of the bottle like I'm a week old
Bedroom looking like a peepshow, she love it when I call her my freak ho
But she my bottom bitch, always on top of things
I'm pimping for a living, diamonds in my pinky ring
Twenty four karats spitting out, with a nigga speak
No leftovers from the salad, I'm talking My gold teeth
