[Verse 1: Callon B]

HOOt

GY...B, sIMple what up?

Mayan Cigars

My Kush and Coronas x4

All my homies stonas, bet we roll up roll up roll up
Blowing Doja, sip Coronas ronas ronas
In a coma, if you don't know us please condone us
But we hardly ever sober there inebriated soldiers
Ask The Mayor how we get down, we need your vote, we in your town
The Campaign is here and I pray it's clear who the livest party right now
We got open polls for the coldest hoes we bring em in and right out
All I here is that White Owl hOOt hOOt, need pipe down
My sack so obnoxious it's talking shit you hear the scent when I'm walking in
Might not talk again, out of body I'm off the grid, the other side is not pretend
There's more to life y'all got to get, I brought the wRaps who got the piff?
DJ DO YOU GOT SOME RIFF?!?!
Every one of us a basket case we flee the scene and smash the gate
Hit the gas for a fast escape, this shit a jam dap Nasty Nate
Fall's impact won't last a day so it's GYB till I pass away
Junkie Nation I'm a pack a day plus Sweatpants bitch better back away

[Chorus: Callon B and Taylor James]

I, ain't, slept, yet, if it's before dusk
I, can't, get, used, to being grown up
I, blame, it, on, the ones before us
They never told usssss, tore up off my Kush & Coronas
Ronas, ronas, ronas, ronas, ronas, my Kush & Coronas
Ronas, ronas, ronas, ronas, ronas, my Kush & Coronas
Ronas, ronas, ronas, ronas, ronas, my Kush & Coronas
Kush and Coronas, ronas

[Verse 2: sIMple]

Five missed calls from Callon calling saying that he got the Dank
Let me make a stop right here up at the bank
Goodness gracious roll the grape up in the Raw papers
Dab up fast and pass it, he told me he always got my back
Came through with a thirty rack of Ronas on us
Zoning off the fire smoke I'm always with my homies
Homegrown thats the starter pack, meddy herb the Veteran
Sick in need of medicine indeed this weed and extracts got me feeling like an Astronaut
NASA pot, essential to rain, extra terrestrial and right now bitch I'm blasting off
Inebriated, for the simple folks I'm hella faded
Right now I'm rollin doja, lonely stoner can't see the back of the Treehouse
Thats a nickname for my whip I hear he pulled the weed out
Busted out the Ziplock, I rip twice then I lift off
These red lights do not mean stop, these red eyes mean that weed strong
Mommas like "Please not another weed song!"

[Chorus: Callon B & Taylor James]
