[Intro]
Damn them motherfuckers don't know about this wavy shit man
That South Beach shit, know what I'm sayin'?
Space nigga shit man, on another level

[Hook x2]
Sex money & drugs
Sex money & drugs
Sex money & drugs
Sex money & drugs

[Verse 1]
SpaceGhostPurrp, Muney Jordan on the beats'
Catch you slippin' out your car, leave you dead in the streets
Lil' mama call my phone 3:AM when I'm sleep
Beggin' me to put it on her with the late night creep
Levi's on my ass, rollin' doobies and grass
Hella hoes walkin' by, I'm watchin' titties and ass
See I'm zooted and booted, watchin' Adult Swim
Everybody outside but I ain't fuckin' with them (Fuck 'em)
I'm a space nigga bruh, yeah I stay to myself
I be on my own planet, all I need is the wealth (Wavy money)
I'm in my zone, puttin' on my cologne
Victoria Secret on, the matching bra with her thong
When she take it all off, I be pinchin' myself
You know I gotta thank God for the wealth
Sex, money & drugs, that's what we all surrounded by
I wanna be rich God, Lord, I don't wanna die

[Hook]
Sex, money & drugs (You know this world fucked up)
Sex, money & drugs (You know this world fucked up)
Sex, money & drugs (You know this world fucked up)
Sex, money & drugs (You Know this world fucked up)
