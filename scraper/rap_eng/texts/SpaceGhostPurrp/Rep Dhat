[Hook x4: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Nigga we the dark side, fuck what you gon' say
This be that 2.7.5., rep that everyday

[Verse 1: DoughDough]
2.7.5., four-five on my side
Bullets fly, aims high, between your eyes, no lie
Where I'm from we make the chicken type fry
Send your soul to the sky, tell God I said hi
Pimp C told me never let ho niggas slide
So I'm riding with my five, play crazy you will die
We was taught to shoot first, and later ask why
Soft ass niggas, sweet like pumpkin pie, I ain't fucking with 'em
Let the four-fifth hit him, throw his body in the river
Let the gators nibble on his flesh
Find his body shriveled, dome shot to his temple
Just to let you know bitch, your fucking with the vet
Don't disrespect, you best protect your neck
Cause like a bad cold, I'm gon' be in your chest
Dropping bodies like Goldberg, I'm just asking who's next
I'm check-mating niggas, like a game of chess

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]
You is not a gangster, nigga you's a bitch
Spend a couple paper, put you in a ditch
Death to every hater, who be talking shit
This is for my Raider's, rest in peace to Jitt
I'ma fucking shank ya, split you in your shit
My niggas got bangers, and you gon' get hit
I'ma hit up Raina, so she ride this dick
I'm a fucking playa, bitch I am the shit
Better say your prayers, talking shit 'bout Jitt
Bullets finna spray ya, bloody up your shit
Feeling like the mayor, 'cause I'm running shit
My city Jason Taylor, yeah they hitting licks
No she not a skater, but she grinding dick
Call me Justin Slayer, she be cumming quick
Say she from Decatur, so you know she thick
Balling like the Lakers, flexing with my clique
Bitch

[Hook]
