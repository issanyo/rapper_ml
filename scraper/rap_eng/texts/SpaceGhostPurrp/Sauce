[verse 1: Adair Lijane]

Yeah nigga aight
Style original, yeah that shit is all mine
You flex on the shit you think we all like
Lets make lil' comparison with our lives
Your girl said you hit is kinda Microsoft gotta run a whip and I'm fucking with a hard drive
Nigga really start to feel like freezer
So everywhere I go boy I Goku hoku
My t-shirts boy you know they custom made
"Where did you get it from"
"I cannot say"
"Can you make me one"
"How much you gon' pay"
"One for the free, get the fuck out my face"
If they have Harlem then I probably would have raced that
Ain't no competition nigga tell me where the race at
Wow, lazy niggas really dragging their balls
I get a M like Fajitas so face tag nigga

Sauce, ay
Ain't no need for the juice when I'm dressing with the sauce, ay
They want a taste or two when they see me with the sauce, ay
Ain't trust me the whole crew be walking with the sauce, ay
Ain't no way we gone loose when I'm carrying
I pull up, I hop out, that whip skirt, I draw crowds
I pull up, I hop out, that whip skirt, I draw crowds
Talk about sauce boy, thats me and the homies
This is that sauce you can only get from me

[verse 2]

I'm the one toupe, but I wear the filled toupe with 2k take a shot like 2k
[?] to be today because to may, all about the moolay (hey)
So idiotic, bragging about style like they got it (mmhm)
Basic what you rocking
Can't belive what you been copping
Nigga look at where you shopping
Boy you really need to stop it
I got it, she gave me a taste
Don't make a point out, she rolling the face
Face stay one hairstyle, them like very day
Play in my hair and she watching the maid
And before you kiss your girl just know there's magic on they hoe lips
Cause the same place where they hoe kiss is the same place where my focus is
