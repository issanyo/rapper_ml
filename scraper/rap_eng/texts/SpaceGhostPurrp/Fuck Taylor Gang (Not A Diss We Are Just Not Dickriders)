[Verse:]
Back in the day
We used to play
Now we got older
Part got colder
Rolling up papes
Locs on my face
Ass on my lap
Bitch im takin her waist
What can I say ? im a fly ass nigga
Im lyrically murdering, you niggas with triggers
Not on the biggest paper & presidents
Gotta connect on sour & medicine
Bitch im a veteran, setting these trends
Purp in yo city, like the store for the kids
This ain't no wiz, so fuck a khalifa
This nasa gang raider shit, im black like the reapers
I got a good hit so im buzzing like beepers
I got me a broomstick, I call it streetsweeper
Ufos higher than paper planes
This ain't no taylor gang, nigga this that raiders mane

[Hook x3]

If you rep what you rep nigga rep that
The fuckin raiders in this bitch wearing all black
Getting ratchet at the mouth gone get yo head cracked
Gone and rep that (x2)

[Outro]
Man fuck yall hoes man all yall hoes think yall the shit my nigga
But really all yall hoes stankier than the rest of everybody else on this motherfuckin earth nigga
Yal doodoo stink than everybody else doodoo bitch, bitch you stinkier than a motherfucka
Bitch quit tryna act like you the baddest bitch on earth
All yall hoes man, fuck yall hoes man, ion give a shit man

Pussy is yall only power man, straight up foo ya ass all that
Bitch if it wasn't for that, you wouldn't be shit
You know what im sayin' ?

You just like tyga bitch
Without yo tats bitch you wouldn't be shit
You feel me, that real nigga, straight up
SGP nigga
Swag nigga
