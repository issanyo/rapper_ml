[Verse]
Space shit, space ship, bitch, fuck relationships
Space swag, NASA gang, [?] space whip
Red diamonds on my neck, same color planet Mars
Yeah niggas [?] so I call my diamonds [?]
My flow is no gravity, so I ain't got [?]
Doobie got me floatin' bitch, I ain't got time for cars
If I see a bad bitch, gotta show the hoe the cash
Bitches hate broke lame niggas, so they hold my swag
Mack shit, pimp shit, all these hoes ain't shit
Got to think about money, can't think with my dick
Trap niggas sell ya bricks, real niggas sell [?]
Chopper make 'em run fast like they on a treadmill
Young nigga 19 I'm still off a punchline
City of Miami where they bang hard like drumlines
Burst .48, niggas snitchin' to the [?]
Rest in peace G, yeah you only live one time

[Bridge]

[Outro]

Real niggas be like "Ay, that boy SpaceGhostPurrp be 'tarded as fuck, but that boy be goin' in though"
