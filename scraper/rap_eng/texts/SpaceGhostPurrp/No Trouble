[Hook: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Y'all niggas don't want no trouble
Y'all niggas don't want no trouble
Y'all niggas don't want no trouble
Y'all niggas don't want no trouble
Beat him, beat him, beat him
Beat him, beat him, beat his ass to the floor nigga
Beat him, beat him, beat him
Beat him, beat him, beat his ass to the floor nigga

[Verse 1: Nell]
Dread life, Southside, nigga get your head right
Hopping up out, tote guns, those True's gon' meet you at the red light
Black flag mask, and we flagging the fucking four
My niggas be 'bout that pressure, leave your ass on the fucking floor
So ask if you doesn't know, my nigga be 'bout them K's
Leave them slayed, niggas be laid out
That's how they taking the day route
Cause niggas dying every day, loccin' up off the J
Leaving them in the day, trying to get paid, putting them in the grave
Catch 'em slipping with that beam, your hearing that pop, pop, and he off at the top
His heart stop, and his body drop
Slumped out and he mollywhopped
So he better run, they aiming the gun
And all of them batty man
With the economy with ya', I'm coming to hit ya'
Forty, he had that Tommy gun
Cause we reside from the fucking slums, get live as we fucking want
Lock him in the trunk cause we abide by the fucking phonk
I ride with a fucking pump, look in my eyes
See the gristle, it lies under rizzle of my pride nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]
I'm from the Southside of that damn F.L.A
Why disrespect if you gon' have to pay
The consequences from the shit that you say
These busta ass niggas must learn the hard way
To torture and torment these hoes everyday
My city of demons who shoot up your place
We broke in the club and we fucked up the place
I don't give a fuck cause my nigga gon' spray
Rat-tat-tat-tat what the fuck got you spooked
Fuck the police cause they crooked in blue
This how we do and we keeping it true
True to the day man, I ride for my crew
Disrespect Jitt, now your life you gon' lose
Niggas gon' hate but these bitches gon' choose
Come to my city, then give you the blues
They leave you real shitty, now you out your shoes

[Hook]
