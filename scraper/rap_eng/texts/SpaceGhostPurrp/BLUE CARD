Blue card

Love my blue card/ love these blue faces
Fuck them crackas/ boys in blue stay investigating/ never go alone/ got 3 in the whip waiting/ cuz variable keep changing

Never touch a bullet with ur bare hands bro
Never speak more than u need or get canceled
I walk with the meek/
If she got a fat ass might make her turn the other cheek
All praise to allah/ live like Buddha/ Ima god
/break bread with these shooters/ prostitution isn’t wrong/ miss backpage independence make u strong/ mumia abu Jamal in all my songs yuh

Love my blue card/ love these blue faces
Fuck them crackas/ boys in blue stay investigating/ never go alone/ got 3 in the whip waiting/ cuz variable keep changing

Raised in Kendall with bar heads and instrumentals/ cash stashed for incidentals/ soft top mementos/ in the rental/ in the meadow add the lake/ foot on the petal/ dont break/ a gram ain’t a .8/ I’ll take a q to the face/ need dispensaries/ Jsr my elementary/ it’s elementary to never elevate ur enemy/ an elephants memory rolling eleven deep keep it 100 like we some centipedes this is fate yuh
