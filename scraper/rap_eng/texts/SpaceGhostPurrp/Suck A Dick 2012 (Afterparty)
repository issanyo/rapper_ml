[Verse]
Baby girl you a pro, you so mothafuckin' sexy
Lookin' at me at the same time while you get real fancy
Baby girl not a ho, you just love me better
Speak how feel keepin' it real cause I get you wetter
Kissin' all on the floor, black lipstick all on me
Whisperin' and heavy breathin' too, too mothafuckin' horny
Drop that pussy slow and make sure it drop harder
Dunkin' in your spot so hard, I'm feeling like Vince Carter
Said she love the scene, now it's three ina' mornin'
And I been on she had that talent when she started that mornin'
Shorty know how to clean, thoroughly and deeper
Back and forth lovin' her vacuum cleaner
Baby girl put it in, throw it back like a pitcher
Then I'mma catch it like Randy Moss then go again and hit cha'
Yea we do a sin, but yea we still got children
Adam and Eve, fuckin' in leaves this the beautiful feelin'
All the haters gon' hate, all the playas gon' play
Take off your thong, get in your zone so we can have a party
I lovin' what you say, shawty swing my way
When I get you drunk when I get you crunk off lean and aliz√©
Now sit back and lay, relax and say
That you want me to fuck you so bad this way
Baby I love your face, you use it well
Suckin' my dick, suckin' my dick FUCK 2012

[Bridge]
Suck a dick, suck a dick
Suck a dick, fuckin' bitch

[Hook]
Suck a nigga dick for 2012
Hatin' ass niggas, they can burn in hell
Raider is the klan, we don't follow shit
Open up your mouth bitch and swallow it
