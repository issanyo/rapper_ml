[Intro]

[Hook x4: SpaceGhostPurrp]
A movie
Finna' make a movie
I don't chase no pussy, cause these bitches wanna do me

[Verse: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Flintstone diamonds, that's a lot of rocks
Keeping shit locked, like the dope pusher on your block
Free me nigga Doe
Yeah we working and swervin'
Fucking hella hoes who ain't virgins
Thinking 'bout counting, what I made up
I stay up, every single night, hella prayed up
Get your weight up
Boy you a pee-on, new wealth knee-on
I ain't lee-on
Speaking real shit, like a nigga preach-on
These niggas flaw, you could see 'em leech on
Reaching on, the tip of my dick, as she ride my shit
Tryna' get her body thick
For real, a nigga been trill
All that sneak dissing nigga, will get your ass killed
I don't do it, cause damn World rolls so deep
Only bitch niggas gossip
Boy I know you niggas creep

[Hook x4: SpaceGhostPurrp]

[Verse 2: Key Nyata]
I'm gripping on the paper, like grip on her ass
Tight grip, never slip, or you'll wind up in grass
Till the casket, you bastard, my shit on smash
In the hood where niggas thrash, leaving bodies in the trash
In a race for some cash, I ain't never heard of last
I'm just trying to shine bright, but I got a tarnished past
I'm looking real fly, while she turbulate her ass
I was always high in class, never there cause I was bad
I never gave a damn
And still don't, will kill folks who threaten my fam
Will fuck hoes, who fuck hoes, as long as their bad
To a lot of rap niggas, I'm looking like your dad
The master of your craft
Macaroni, you don't know me
I will beat your ass
Test, you'll pass, I mean literally, you'll pass
But this ain't no class
I'm coming for that cash, and a bad bitch with some ass
(Nigga)
