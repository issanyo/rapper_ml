[Intro]
There's a lot of shit going on in this world, man
Lot of shit
And you know what, I'm sick of this shit, man
Everybody complaining about this hip-hop shit
But ain't nobody trying to do shit about this shit
And I feel like I'm alone in this shit man
Know what I'm sayin'?
No offense to everybody who down with me, cause they countin' on me
But y'all motherfuckers gotta take action around this motherfucker man
Bro, we the new generation, we're supposed to make the OG's proud
All them pioneers supposed to be proud of us right now
They mad as fuck right now
I can see it in their eyes
And ain't nobody tryin' to do shit right now
Ain't no more originality
It's a lot of weak ass souls, and y'all punk ass motherfuckers need to stop that shit
Everybody need to be they motherfuckin' self from day four, nigga
And that's real, niggas tryin' to take action and fuckin' do what we gotta do
Set good examples for the youth, bruh, stop pollutin' these little kids minds with that bullshit
And that's real
And stop teaching our girls the wrong shit
We tryin' to make our girls into women, nigga
Our girls in our generation fucked up, and I blame you fuck niggas for it
Oh, not 'cause you doggin' it, nah
That's a part of life anyway
It's because you feedin' their mouths with that bullshit through these songs
So fuck all y'all niggas who don't understand what I'm talkin' about
Take motherfuckin' action nigga, stop bitchin' about the rap game

[Verse 1]
Better take action
For the generation, for the satisfaction
All the stars smackin'
All these punk motherfuckers that be actin'
They don't want to see us make it
They just want to see us kill each other and keep hatin'
No, I can't keep waitin'
Yes, I got to stand up 'cause a nigga can't take it
I need a suggestion
Start the recession, give me a depression
Yo momma keep stressin'
Tryin' to survive just to see some progression
I learned my lesson
Gotta take action, gotta make an exit
Life is precious
With a lot of broken dreams, so you better expect it
After extortion
Baby on the way, gotta get abortion
Momma keep snortin'
Livin' in hell, but the money important
Life is short, and
So fucked up but they never gave a warnin'
They know
All the negative pain elevate, keep goin'

[Hook (slowed)]
Gotta take action
Gotta take action
Gotta take action, Gotta take action (Hello?)
Gotta take action

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of this bullshit
I'm sick of my people dyin' from the boolin'
Craft in the bucket ?
Tryin' to bring me down like a little niggas poolin'
Don't fuckin' act stupid
Take your finger off the trigger, little nigga, don't shoot it
I know you want to do it
Don't take this life, nigga, think about the future
People want to judge me
Actin' like you know me, but they won't show me
Thinkin' I'm lucky
You just want to fuck me, you don't want to love me
Don't lie to me
'Cause I don't give a damn if you really wanna do me
Baby just screw me
So you can move on, always keep a true me
You can't fool me
You can never rule me, you can never school me
Livin' in a movie
That ? call life, better get a lot of groupies
The paper never rule me
I speak too truly, why they choose me
Mind over movie
'Cause I spit real shit so a nigga can't shoot me

[Hook]
