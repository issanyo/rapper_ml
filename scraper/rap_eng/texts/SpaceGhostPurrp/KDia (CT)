[Verse 1: Robb Bank$]
Aye I'm blowing cancer clouds just to stunt
Reggaeton out the mouth of my plug
Over a mil for your deal, I bet you still ain't bought a gun
That random shit you call kush look like it came with the swisher
All these blues clues pussies
Random niggas done came into the picture bitch
My lil' nigga whats up when I got a scale out of bail
You want to see that shit for yourself?
Well bring that ass to Slaughterdale
Side-note, bitch ain't know the empire you been reppin' all built on lies, ho
I'm bout to build up out mine, to where I make these teens talk
Sit on the hood of this designer that a nigga that copped while out in Sri Lanka
Swear that the whole time you been talking I just imagine laying beside ya'
Swear I be having myself convinced that I don't love these hoes
But be falling in love with all the ones that I dont take time to text on my phone
White lies, put a ease on her mind
She thought about giving me head while I drive, threw D's on her mind
So, one time yeah I been in love just one time
The other four, they ain't really count
I couldn't really call none of them mine, know what I'm talkin' bout?
And I'm fine with the guilt, all them spiritual women I had fucked with
Saying I should get out my head, experience love
But they ain't never want to take that shit past touching
No, won't say I love you for such bluffs there's repercussions
But no, the drum kit by my heart be the spot that you hear in the percussion
Aye, why lie she ain't my type that's a given
But when I hit it from the back, boy we look good together
Yeah that girl complexion matte, and she smell like Chanel
You see my hand through that lace, of that Victoria, don't tell em fuck boy

[Hook: Phlo Finister] x2
I believe I don't want to stay
Once again that I'll find it my way, my way, my way

[Verse 2: Robb Bank$]
Sim simma
What's new, a nigga quit drinking liquor
But what's new with you, except that ass getting a lil' bigger
No disrespect to you
I admire that, in the old days, I might have liked that, but no no
You can't stay in contact, no
I don't miss you, shit but I'll give it to you
You had it first, broke it first
I'd get a full clip, or credit to where ever it's deserved
When I came to, I had smanged two, to get over you
Shit, so from me to you, bitch, I'm saying thank you
Aye I'm too good to these people, and they don't see shit
But the RSVP's from the DM
Boy Ill punch your VS so people only touch your DM
Should get the color right and get your bitch out my DM's
Aye and all these niggas pussy, I can see they camel toe
And that four I poured just had me fucking you slow
Don't think for one second I made love to you ho
And you having her twist up your pine
Become equivalent to call the name you ho
My eyes look hypnotized bout how she rise like when the Pokemon enable it back
Parsel tongue in her ear and get all up inside her
And keep in mind that nigga still a minor
But besides that I drop my pants and release the Kraken
Stick it in and massage that
Bitch look like an Odd Future fan, the way she roll her eyes back
