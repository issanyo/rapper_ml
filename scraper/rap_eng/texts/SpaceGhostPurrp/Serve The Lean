[Verse 1: Tech$ Finesse]
All ya'll non beilevers, underachievers, dick eaters, penis pleasers
It don't phase me too call you motherfuckers out when I see it
Riff raff wouldn't want beef wit me
Youtube posting frequently, motherfuckers ask why I always whoop ass, and I never take names, I said it all before I'm a fucking riot maker bitch
Ask your local ho I beat her pussy out the frame
If you got flow you can grow motherfuckers
Sin city, thick chick, with 6 titties, tight clit, for me willy, date her?
Man not really, mary jane, I'll split the philly, stupid high, I'm dumb silly, my brain got me thinkin a milli, but not really
I'm worth 2 bucks give 2 fucks got 2 trucks with 20 sluts, each take your blunts, while I bust a 6 nut, deep in
Andrew luck
Aw shucks!
Fresh to death, with a link cuff, got a mean scruf, mustache ride
She can't bluff when I dive muff she will cream puff
Got her out her skin and I didn't even need dove
Swagger on a million your useless like a pigeon stop typing rhymes wasting peoples mental time
I'm the diabolic
Pot smoking no bars holding choke slam bolding you into oblivion
I'm the lion and your the puss
Imma hang you on my noose with my powerful mind
I'll spin you away from this page you won't exist to me like a pager
You ugly faggot stranger
Hold on you killed it well I'm bringing it back
Yea I'm listening I think ya' rhymes are wack
I thought they taught how to spell in 1st grade
I work so you know I get paid
My nigga you can't see me through a microscope
You probably go to jail and purposely drop the soap
You must smell like real shit, but you really need to quit
Like David Ortiz I'll make a hit you'll probably take a hit, of dope, coke
I don't know your a joke
Your talking but i feel your rhymes are trash and your girl gets smashed
Pass me the Dutch with your left hand so I can get Higher and start this beat off with fire, fire flame spitter, whipping up buds like master splinter
An you know I'm a winner, go figure, making six figures in a year
Call that shit verve cause you know its almost here
Don't be afraid it's not a raging steer, but stand clear
The revolutions on its way, and I can say, once its here, its here to stay
We don't play, with our money we keep that shit 100
Got dope don't mope best not choke when you toke, they call me John Roe but you might know me as John Doe flows so sick all the hoes be catching a cold
I'm locked up in my house trying to get more cheese like a lil' mouse
Time to run up this girls blouse an see what shes all about

[Verse 2: Tech$ Finesse]
Serve The Lean
Pass the drugs
Pass the what?
Birds eye view, paper cards on the window
Blowin on some indo, indoors, no chores, never in the quiet seat
I'm a beat, this track up, so their will be a train derail
See you in hell, from a bird eye view, or should I say an angels view
Very few, can do, anything that's exciting, inviting, you to try, try and die
Die to survive, live again, make a friend, live life like hin
See your seens, drinking gen, pardon this, I'm heading to the rest room
Motherfuckers love to talk that shit
They really can't get enough of it, but I'm still in this bitch like a fucking kid
Coming to you from the 601, drop it down like a bomb
Here to heat yo ass up, like some napalm, so be calm
Homie you don't really want that
I'm about that
That combat, tap your brain, blown your mind
Bullets penetrate through your spine
You lived by the gun, you didn't think you would end up dying from one
Your mom should have had more kids, cuz now she seedless
Cuz now she's seedless
She's really seedless dog
Should really check up on that though

[Verse 3: Tech$ Finesse]
Money on the table
Haters all day I don't care I'm gettin laid I'm getting paid
Hit you right now, you a dike now u fly now?
I'm high now, just die now, I'm dog ho you a lame nigga
Spitting harder then an average nigga spitting
Everything I say inspirational in your own damn way so learn from me
The streets is mean its cold out there, its cold in here its burr burr
Free guwop lean wit me
Lean in my cup, got my slut, in the motherfucking truck and I'm ducked off
Sold dope, did it big, fuck you I'm damn rich
I ain't even rich though, I'mma let you know
I'mma come in. We got the 4-10s
4-10s, We got 4-10s, I got 5 friends
We need more then
Bring the vodka in, and pour the gin, I only drink if it’s foreign sent
I’m high enough that I’m soaring
Put the tip inside Lauren
Now she's whoring, now she's twerking
I feel sorry for her boyfriend
I'm a young black male
I dont follow the rules to stay outta jail, but the odds are still against me
I'm free but don't really feel free
I grew up living in poverty
Stressed and being depressed all the fucking time but it ain't bother me
Like a million things run threw my mind
Success and happiness I need to find before its to late

[Outro: Tech$ Finesse]
This vision in my mind if the good book is right
Fire sulfur ice will be falling from the sky
