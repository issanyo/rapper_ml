[Verse 1: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Bitch sipping on some motherfucking lean on me

Fucking up a nigga with a gun up in his fucking hand
Finding niggas who got trigger's then I take them away
Element's around the way ever fucking day
Young nigga grew up to that fucking Eazy E
Watching these (young?) niggas jerking like some B I T C Hs yea I hate these fucking ways
These niggas acting every day living like hella
Hoes getting hella O' selling it im yelling it loud
