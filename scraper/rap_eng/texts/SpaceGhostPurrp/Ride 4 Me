[Intro]
So we gon' give shout out to all those down-ass females
Who be holding down for all the niggas out here and shit
Staying loyal to my nigga
24/7
Three sixty motherfucking five
Holding a nigga down all day, everyday
Never turn on a nigga on nothing
That's the way I love that shit

[Hook x4]
She'll ride for me
She'll ride for me
She'll die for me
She'll ride for me

[Verse]
She gon' hold it down, hold it down for a young nigga
Serving pounds, serving pounds for a young nigga
I know just how she want it when I dick her
Down ass round yeah she love a young nigga
I figure
She can be more loyal than you niggas
So I gave her ass a pistol so don't try to rob a nigga
Cause she gon' blast that ass
Don't fuck around with my cash
She be looking out the snakes so they don't hit the grass
She the baddest
We the flyest
She loyal
She dyky
She yellow, I like it
I love it, she violent
In the kitchen cooking, no clothes on
Her ass fat, she got it
Making sure a nigga eat good
Shit like a paradise on an island
I'm staring, her ass up, we look good, we match up
She love me, cause I'm me, she know I ain't no actor
And you know she gon' die for a nigga
That's why I hit her spot when she ride for a nigga

[Hook]
