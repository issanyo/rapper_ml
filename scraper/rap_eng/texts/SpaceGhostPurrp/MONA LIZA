[Verse 1]
Yall lost in these streets
Why the fuck, yall fuck wit me
I dont give a damn
If someone start shooting at me
Its beat or either get beat
Knock you out cold till yo brain go to sleep
[Verse] 2
The darkest days of knights are the ones that really creep
Yall better watch out cause the hole Is really steep
One little mistake will change a person's reef
Brain so full the memories really deep
People religions are covering their souls
Soon along my way I'll start selling souls
I am the crow, Ima borrow some yo cash for a trade of your soul
In return you really get coal
Triple 6 6 6 really darkens the road
In the naked eye all you see is a code
Remember the dose of people in dark clothes that killed for the trade of narc topes to hang hoes with brown ropes, that's my ghost of my rose, flying to see life chose, I'm real closed, I'm not dope, I just need me a Bush to smoke

[HOOK]
Everyday, Everyday Going throught the same shit (x8)


[Verse 3]
