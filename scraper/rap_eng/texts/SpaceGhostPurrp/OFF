444 right at the door/ 786 better remind that bitch/ I ain’t sure if u legit/ look like jersey shore with frosted tips/ i am the real/ we are the real/ came with the pack vacuum sealed/
Kpakk only state facts we need concealed/
Army base before eureka they peek at you the need the proof if they can’t they plant residue/ what do we do/ pay our dues/ self sufficiency fuck yo school/ finesse the finesser/ fuck an aggressor/ get an investor/ franklins a great mentor/ cop a duplex for renters/IRA/ BMI/ EPK
Peep the lecture/ Ima change my kids kids lives forever/ you ain’t did shit but be a dipshit
And deny the weather/ mal criado and sheltered/ fuck cash bail we need faster trials/ gerrymandering fuck it denial/ let’s blow gas and at least smile/ need me mo tree/ need me thc lean by the o z / pour me another glass/ need me good credit and a bag of cash/ a metric shit ton of hash/ a gum job and plelvic dust trust into Martha’s ass/ sidhartha withstanding Guantanamo’s past/ let it go vamanos hop in the jag/ yo get in we got to go fast/ pass me the garden hose we gotta grow grass/

I smoke to much weed to give a fuck

11 11 a message from heaven/ 305 hope I make it to 25/ if it was written why am I guessing/ omens are hidden and it’s all depressing/ off in the in the distance I’m off and I’m distant/ how often I’m offered assistance/ which often leads to resistance/ awful I’m awfully committed to often offer nothing but good riddens/ good god come intermiten/ when I pray in my gut I feel that she listens/ the noise gets loud and its easy to give in/ survival of the fittest or play the victim/ write out my vision and make it my mission/ twisting blunt after blunt in love with the wisdom bless whoever listens
Moments of undeniable brilliance
Paralleled by incoherent indifference
Paint me vivid honestly depicted
How I existed not how I wished I had lived it
Explcit how I really want it/ visit all ur inner callings/ listen or end up haunted/ dip in ur toes stop stalling/ John Stewart George Carlin/ Rogan Seth McFarlan/ go in get started/ all greats thought they were retarded/ doubt bombarded/ clearing my conscious/ increased my deposit/ it’s never a contest/ if ur humble and honest/
Il roll now get a whole pound / if the homie throw down I’ll roll now x 4

I smoke to much weed to give a fuck

Dusty roads/ hidden codes/ miss me then they diss me I never know/ where to call my home/ I feel so alone/ hope this helps them know they can’t help me/
Want it bad/ walk through 50k all in cash/ bad bitch boxer braids/ really chillin on my lap/
Stadium x3 tours
I swear to god ima get mine I pray u get yours
Finish line after finish line it’s mine for sure
In my prime all the time find your own cure
Pray the second my eyes open every day
I will live long enough for my son to see my grave
Optimize my life and higher my frequency
Prioritize my time and inspire my enemies
Organize my spite and retire that energy
Emphasize my wife my slice of heavenly
Dusty roads/ hidden codes/ miss me then they diss me I never know/ where to call my home/ I feel so alone/ hope this helps them know they can’t help me/
