[Hook] x2
Wake up every morning cold, shit gotta get sold
My house yeah it's full of mold, and crack for my fiends souls
Ego no I won't grow old, baby I got no goals
Never will you see me fold, remix the rock swole

[Verse 1]
Withdraw everyday, the moment I wake
Perkies I gotta take, with a Kpin, okay
Everything I hate, world need a escape
What I even make, yeah, just for fucks sake

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
Girls I leave for substance, left the bitch for nothing
Left five hundred hoes lusting, to my customers I'm rushing
Smoke sum they H, fuck it, want it fuck this
Let my organs rip, neverending ego trip
Hitting millions of licks, and not remembering shit
Baby girl lemme slip, watch them switch
Watch me just get rich, off this dumb rap shit
See me rolling with sticks, see me gloing wit the shit

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
I can do anything, except make you think
Dirty bitch on the brink, snort ice skating rink
Crystals drip on the mink, snort white beside the sink
I just got lots opiates on me, drugs they can't leave
My system need relief, need some of that leaf
Smoking while head leaks, sipping while I sneak
Past her parents, oh shit, ego on a fuckup streak
Nothing new to me, quickly lose me
