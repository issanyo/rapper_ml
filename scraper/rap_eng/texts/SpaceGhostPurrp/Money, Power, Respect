Spaceghostpurrp, I'm bringing the phonk quick
'88 convertible all black, ride slick
Ya chick want me cuz' I kissed on her
Made her ride on me when I licked on her
Intellectual, sexual, all in one
Got my gun, runnin' up on me, yo ass done
I'm from, a city where they mack for fun
And if you cross the bridge you gon' be in the slums
I'm talkin' bums, vamps, zombies and wolves
Who all lurk at night, and I ain't talkin' bout Suge
Red and black Jordan ones, same color Death Row
Mixin' gin in that juice, with that Aliz√© ho
My flow is like a martian on two X pills
Tat my name on that pussy so I know that its real
I feel like makin' ya moan
While you call that fuck nigga now he mad on the phone

[Hook]
God damn man, yo bitch fine
I guess, it's time, to make her mine
Money, power, respect
Money, power, respect

You can, you can not fuck with us, Raider Klan mafia
And when you hear the phone, we be turnin' the party up
Hit the Bacardi up, mixin' with hella labels
She twerkin' and workin' while I'm coppin' up all the ?
Ass is amazing, her pussy is blazing
It's hot, hot, hot, but you know I can take it
I make it better when I'm getting it wetter
The dick was so good that she wrote me a letter
I let her, hit up Versacci, I love her body
And when she move it slow, she do it right on the ?
Don't copy me, me, my nigga, just be yourself
I been to hell and back, my mentality help
Watch your wealth, and look out for snakes and goldiggers
Cuz' bitches love life so they hate broke niggas
I figure, a nigga got to stay so clean
I don't beef ? niggas, I just get to the green

[Hook]
