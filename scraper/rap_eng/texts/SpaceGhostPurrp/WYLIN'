[Hook: King Lion]

Bitch I'm wylin'
Uh oh oo oh
I said bitch I'm wylin'
Why you letting go

Bitch I'm wylin'
Uh oh oo oh
I said bitch I'm wylin'
Why you letting go

[Verse 1: King Lion]

I'm the human form of Entei
And I came up from the UK
So I said Fuck what they say
And Then I'm roaring with my new ways
Wearing common projects
When I'm walking in the projects
So I said fuck their whole logic
And my third leg be an Onix
Getting more money than the lecturer
Guess I don’t need no lecture huh
Wylin' while I walk it out
When the beast is gonna gesture her
Beast mode damn I’m flexing out
She started up north now she heading south
And I might just have to blow the mouth
You know I fucking hit the spouse
I put the past in the motherfucking past
And Im living each day as if it would be my last
Then i get to do my business
Then I get on foot and dash
With the fast track on that jet black
Im just blowing all the cash
She be my Celebi
And she might let it be
Might just let her go
Looking for my fantasy
Feel like Kamina
Wheres my Lucky Star
Floating in the higher sky
Cause I done really gone too far
