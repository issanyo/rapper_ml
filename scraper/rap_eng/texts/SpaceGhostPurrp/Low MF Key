[Verse 1]
I'm ridin' slow off in that Cadillac Triple black
Stack money
Fake bitches ain't gettin' check from me
I'm Low-key but kept it true nigga
Watch out for the nigga in the blue pickup
People lurkin Im certain that muthafucka ready to do a stick up I keep the mutha-fuckin' mac
I'mma pretty bitch that spit crack
Ain't nobody touchin' that
So keep truckin For my niggas get to bussin
Ain't no love in these streets
Just some weed and robotussin fool
[Hook]
I stay..Low mutha-fuckin' key
You know I be... Low mutha-fuckin' key
Blowin' on that OG Low-key
That bitch don't know me cus I'm Low-key  2X
[Verse 2]
Woodgrain with the leather seats
Windows so dark you need a flashlight to see me
We like it screwed It be the fast life for me
Gettin' high passin' grass like a G
Flyin' first class over seas hoe
Smokin' sour diesel
Wish a muthafucka would
Now I'm in the hood I be rollin' with the gangsters and macs Pretty bitches ridin' with that thang in the back
And I aim at yo back
It's a shame they  think I can rap
Not makin' music wit yo punk ass hoe I let you suckas know And I'm ridin on that strip
Gun on my hip im ready to trip
If a muthafucka touch my grip
I'm up late and im thinkin' bout jackin'
My niggas bout that action
And they got yo bitch pistol packin'
[Hook]
