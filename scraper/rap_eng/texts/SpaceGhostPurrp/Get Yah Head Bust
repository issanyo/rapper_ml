[Intro]
Let's take these niggas down into the tunnels
To see how that shit looks

[Hook]
Don't get your head bust, nigga
Don't get your head bust, nigga
Don't get your head bust

[Verse 1]
You're never stopping me
Or never knocking me
I'm getting to the money properly
A monopoly
Reversing psychology
Accepting apologies
Niggas talking shit, gotta beat they ass like a hockey team
Nigga, I copy cream, then nigga, I paste it
More money on the pussy, then, nigga, I taste it
Nigga why waste it
We living in Blackland
The city where they try to make it hard for a black man
Nigga keep actin'
I ruin your whole career
Everybody know my Raider bitch is fine as hell
All black on, pretty as fuck, with some long hair
She a true Raider bitch, and nigga, she don't care
Nigga, I'm everywhere, like a Japan roach
But niggas can't stop me, 'cause I am the black ghost
Something like black toast
The black burner made your head rust
Nigga, don't get ya motherfuckin' head bust

[Hook]
Don't get your head bust, nigga
Don't get your head bust, nigga
Don't get your head bust

[Verse 2]
I am the rawest
Never the flawest
Flawless victory
Her pussy is calling
Her pussy is falling
Right on my dick too
My shit is in the middle so I'm drilling her spot too
Yelling don't stop too
She like it harder
Ride on this broomstick, go Harry Potter
Bitch I'm a starter
Right here at my show
And when I perform, I be taking that nigga ho
Lock 'em in figure four
That's how you kill a ho
My niggas squaded up, all black like they 7-4
But they ainâ€™t 7-4
Nigga, they Raider though
NASA gang, nigga, all black with my hippy ho
Nigga be talking though
Sounding like little hoes
But when I come around
Hear no sound
They quiet though
Murcielago
Black on black, same color black dust
Nigga don't get ya mothafuckin head bust

[Hook]
Don't get your head bust, nigga
Don't get your head bust, nigga
Don't get your head bust
