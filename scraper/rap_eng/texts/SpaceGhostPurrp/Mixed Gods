(Verse 1: Kyd Scenario)
HC Zombie Gang
I suggest you stay your lane
Cause all we want is bank accounts, with big amounts a fucking brain
Richard Lymon, Stephen King can both admit we're both insane
Cause I roll a spliff, light the piff and spit out open flames
Stupid lames, keep on thinking the its a fucking game
Talk shit and I'm inflicting Major Paynes like Damon Wayans
Then I'll take your dame, Then I'll take her all the way to Spain
Just to get a tan, you understand man that's the perks of fame (swag)
Your lyrical lordship, the metaphors like a swordsman
Sharp enough to cut heads and hot enough to scorch 'em
We're like the Four Horseman, so y'all need to learn to forfeit
Eat rappers in large portions, instead of plates we use a forklift
Me and Dillon joined forces, a deadly combination
Running for mayor in my city, peep my conglomeration
It's funny how all my doubters say I wouldn't make it
Now I'm the trending topic in every one their conversations
Thanks for waiting, been a long time since a decapitation
Told ya I was warming up, now I'm back and dedicated
Yeah I love your patience, And please excuse me about my lateness
So swallow your pride and chase it down with my greatness

(Verse 2: Dillon McCluskey)
Sitting in my room reading old magazines
Old news in Pro Tools with a catalog like Macy's
Float on like a parade, times ticking I can't wait
I'm desperate and this my last shot, hope I don't fade away
Washed up, cup over, I'm nauseous
I'm the alcoholic at your office
Is it ever too late to party?
Smoke a bowl, get fucked like Mr. Marcus
Yes I'm awesome!
IPhone on shuffle, shuffle like my Iggy Woods poster
I'm never home and I'm never sober
And when I am my friends never come over
And when they do, they act like they don't even know what a coaster is
Fucking losers, pissing away my life for dead dreams
So pissed like I need new bed sheets (are you kidding me?)
Apologize for whatever tomorrow brings
I'm sorry, I just hate being eighteen
