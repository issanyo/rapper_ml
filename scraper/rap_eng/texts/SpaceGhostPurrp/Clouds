[Hook]
I be in them clouds
In them clouds
I be in them clouds
Clouds
Clouds

[Helen $wank]
Higher than I ever been
Gassed up off antihistamines
Its promethazine
Robituss or codeine
Im trippy laughing
Ha ha ha
Until I cough
My voice be soothing when I talk
Im too busy when my baby call
These bitches buggin' the way they stalk
I be trippy and im proud
I be in them clouds
