[Intro]
Got the Christmas tree
And you gotta have the presents
To make your family happy, right?
So before you pull that trigger young man
Don't do it my nigga
You gotta be the god of black powers

[Verse]
Who be the God of Black?
That's me
SGP
Mystical magic colors
My brother's
On MTV
The Black be the power of the soul
Protected by the code
X times X, the G code
In God mode
As I try to expose
The robotic hype beast up in the same clothes
Black toes
She looking too trill with the pretty feet
Chillin like a villain looking pretty in the Caddy seat
Damn! Inspired by the black diamond
Supervision, X-files, shooting star shining
Real mansion with 35 goddesses
Please tell me who the hottest is
Apocalypse, eclipse, but the world too fake
And I guess it's contagious throughout the whole wake
I say, my mind on the secret master plan
The black Gangrel with the cash in my hand

[Hook]
The Black God
I got to have the world in my hands
I'm a God
I'm no longer a black man
The Black God...

[Outro]
Another day, another dollar
Looking at all these people man
This society made by robots, why? this is a society
Who know they wanna get this money
So they turn us into hamsters
Got them on this everyday cycle
Living like programmed machines
To wake up at certain times
And go to bed at certain times
Making people live the way they want them to live
So they can get a simple paycheck and work shitty hours
This the reason why I do this
So I can make sure my family don't have to do that
And we can have independent businesses
Ain't no jobs out here anyway...
