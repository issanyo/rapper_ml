[Hook]
I could of shot her two times
But I didn't, be thankful
I could of took your girlfriend
But I didn't, be thankful
Anything can happen my nigga
So you better be thankful
In the club poppin bottles with my niggas
So grateful

[Bridge]
Nowadays these niggas ain't thankful
And nowadays these bitches ain't faithful
And nowadays everybody wanna hate you
But a nigga like me so thankful

[Verse 1]
Smoking on the best of the best
So I had to look up and say thank you
Sippin on the best of the best
Looked in my cup had to say thank you
Coming from the bottom to the top
I will never forget to say thank you
Cruising on the block drop top
Sunny day made your bitch say thank you
I'm so thankful
Thankful that I ain't you
Man I ball, ball so hard I break ankles
Tryna see me better have pay-per-view
Or motherfucking cable
And when i bring the food to the fucking table
You better be grateful

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 2 - Spaceghostpurrp]
Thankful for this rap shit, cause without this I wouldn't be shit
Thankful for my main bitch how she suck me up and take dick
Thankful for my damn clique, black money world, bitch we the shit
Thankful for my damn steez, counting hella cheese, dead presidents
Thankful for my hustling, put me in rich nigga residents
Thankful for my realness, can't dispose me, no evidence
Thankful for this solid gold, like the way it glow on my neck and wrist
Thankful for all the these shows, we getting dough, we making hits
Hit the mall, cop all the clothes, we pop the tags, stay fly and shit
Thankful for the way I ball, your bitch called like [?]
Thank god, sack the money tall, gotta live life like the president
Thank for my niggas eating, these niggas sleeping, we running shit

[Hook] + [Bridge]
