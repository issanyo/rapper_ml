Kendall got to much money we be board
Kendall got all the grind we skateboard
Kendall ride all the waves we surf board
Kendall the new band wagon all aboard
All of my life/ all of my life/ I hated you/
Ain’t no one fight/ fuck a vibe/ I’m split in 2
Day n night/ I pack my pipe/ to face my truth
Same divide/ that tore my mind/ and made me loose
You or a bigger part of me/ cosmic astrology/ my chart/ aligning with prophecy/ my stars/ain’t something that’s hard to see/ I can be like a hawk ona odyssey/ Mach and me on top of the balcony basking in queso frito and Cali tree/ candidly/ vanity got them all passing fiends/ casually/ acid peaks/ fallacies of pageantry gave them a bitch ass mentality/ tragedy you can’t stand to see/ plan to be something more than a casualty/ I can be better x2
But damn
I need me some weed
Seen all the scenes that made them so green
Fuck them now that I lead mustard seed/ all that I see/ Himalayas under my feet/ alligators walk on the streets/ orange trees scorching heat/ purple leaves indo breeze/ indoor biltmore hotels more that I need/ pillow talk widow chalked in the sheets/ white girl cowboys all in a team/ we know now not what it means/
All of my life/ all of my life/ I hated you/
Ain’t no one fight/ fuck a vibe/ I’m split in 2
Day n night/ I pack my pipe/ to face my truth
Same divide/ that tore my mind/ and made me loose

Integrity love for my enemy/ Fuck celebrity why do they envy me/ envious energy cannot envelope me/ impressing fiends so readily/ Beverly Hills/ preppy Penelope popping her pills/ son off the syrup he a stain for real/ the cards that they give us/ this game can’t chill/ lost and they miss us/gotta pay them bills/ pardon the pick up we American built/ controled by China for dopamine thrills/ dope how we cope/cropped in the field/ my oath to my bros only thing I feel/ came on a boat still afloat ima navy seal/ raised in the east coast we know we ain’t got no chill/ everything I willed

All of my life/ all of my life/ I hated you/
Ain’t no one fight/ fuck a vibe/ I’m split in 2
Day n night/ I pack my pipe/ to face my truth
Same divide/ that tore my mind/ and made me loose

Is there an O IN the pack tell the hoe to relax
Heart so cold that it cracked/ pass me the bowl and the match/ don’t u know it’s a trap/ to sit there fold and relapse/ pray for my soul/ hope that it lasts/ there isn’t control/ only sum facts/ Good lord I know to give thanks/ dont live in the past or with a mask/ they kiss ass guess they treasure in trash/ the pressure whatever/ I smoke and I a laugh/ together is better/ forever on gang/ firmly grasp my ball sack/ itachi intentions fallback/ I pray u release on contact/ on gang
