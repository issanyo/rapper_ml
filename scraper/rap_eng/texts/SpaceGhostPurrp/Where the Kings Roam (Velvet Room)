[Al Pacino speaking]

Mind of a lost soldier, Camouflaged, in the field of my thoughts
Cognitive warfare, Trapped in the cross hairs..
Of practically every trigger, I figure my loss, is imminent
[Speech continued]

Shoutouts to the homie tigershark..
I leave Tyre marks..and let the lighter spark..
But if you look at the situation in full perspective
And just build ya records..hopefully you see the brighter part
They asking about my future lately, I just tell em that I'm in the delorean doing 80
They asking about my future lady, but that topic of discussion, is often uttered so faintly
I'm just trying to get a hologram, but I gotta be fucking legend
Wadup coachella
Let them folks tell ya
Don't let the ropes determine ya pinfall
Watch the count, know the win's all
A young basquiat (pause), but instead, without the canvas and dreads
A micorphone for ya art exhibit, a microphone for you art exhibit c
Tryna be a Jay Elec, but the thought of limitless sees..
No avail..
Though I'm tryna get everybody on this planet to ride the wave like noah's sail
Knowing well, this ain't show ant tell, but I'm at the top of my class
They say that only the strong will survive, in a world of modern day killers
I calmy push away pillars
As thought provoking and potent,as my opponent
I'm sure to pass it, the last of a dying graphic
Step into a realm where the only entrance is final
And I every sentence, I meant when I jot it down, and the vinyl...spins
Not too many individuals I now quote..
They saying that I broke the pedestal since cloud smoke
How overwhelming when the crowd spoke
Sitting on the paramount
Where the kings roam
Where the lonely resides
And Where there has been hope
And where the pleasures of ever walking that thin rope
Determines ya end note
Where the motherfucking kings roam
Tell me one and a half stories
I tell you the memoirs..
And my past surely
Gripping the rails
Steady pressure folding
The last glory
Now what you have for me..
