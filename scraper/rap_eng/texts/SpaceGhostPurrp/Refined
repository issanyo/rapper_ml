[Verse 1: Robb Bank$]
Baller blockin', chicks flapping they wings in the cockpit
I'd move them chickens to yo coop, but these crackers cock-blockin'
I'm chirpin', my niggas barkin' in St. Arthur, same Volvo
The way my bitch hair layered, might try 'er out for the dog show
Let my facial hair grow, on hiatus to the five star
That's where my bitch be living, she Based God in the kitchen
She want me to eat better, but I barely touched the plate
On vacay with my main, ain't even left were I stay
I'm South Florida foreva, I'm yellow xans foreva
And if them folks drop the charges, we can be together forever
Touch slow, fuck fast, money in my waistband
Feel my manicured hands, my accountant from the concentration camp
S.S., fo' months 'til we muhfuckin dead
I'm Babidi, you Majin Vegeta, I'll put some 'M's on yo head
Blowin' tobacco by the water, I don't even like the beach
With fuckin' sand covering our bodies, I feel like muhfucking Gaara (Lil' bitch)
And that ass like her Ferrari, you a stallion, hop up on that shit
Gallop, centaur
Girlfriend, it's horsepower
Made a net-worth off the jugg house in Savage ask him what he 'bout
Me, Montana and Kev, we just in yo hood, ridin' round
Black & Mild lace, so I take it to the face
All A.A laced, I'll sweat the lace front off of Azelia Banks
(Mm-mmm) Gimme kiss show KDia what she been missin'
When it's me, Juice and Purrp I'm fuckin' ten mo' women
Tryna eat, like you feedin' tube ass nigga
You stabbed yo' best friend in the back?
That's the Mangekyō in you nigga
I got the Chi-Chi from amigo
Shed moonlight to Son-Goku
And with all this Cell Camo, boy I feel like Nigo
Now bae, no games
I'm rich according to the gas tank
I thought I told you fuck niggas "We only breathe octane."
Pussy nigga, stop playing I got goons for these type of thangs
Lost yo' money and yo' bitch all when Basquiat came
(Lil bitch)

[Hook]
I'm finer than yo' bitch, hah
And suck my fuckin' dick, boy

And suck my fuckin' dick, boy

[Verse 2: Robb Bank$]
I say, "Ask 'em what he 'bout."
These fashion thugs'll never wear me out
You ain't live, I fashioned myself as the best rapper alive
It's the Savage, reincarnate
Swordfish, South Florida
Savage Life
Wish a ho nigga would cross that border
And I'm back puffin' on canna-b, you know "a year" mean a week
Sesshōmaru pussy, I did it all single-handedly
Look at the time, a nigga got famous over night
Laughing at 'cho Robitussin lean, as I sippeth my Sprite
Fuck niggas on my mind? I got one-two many
So I turn to Disney Channel and think of what I’d do to Demi
And boy shoutout to my Raiders
Nigga, Purrp and Simmie
And I'll sweat the fuck out yo' weave, bitch but only if it's Remy
I need a, project bitch, with a, eighteen-inch sew-in
That I can pull when I give her this infinite
Shit, count that in inches
Put a fo' in that lemon-lime, or a six
And add about two mo' of them shits, lil bitch
Robb Bank$, Illuminati
And I’m loadin' up Kamehameha Waves in the clip of my K
Triple-six, I’m atheist
You thinking “What did he just say?"
Good
Tryna remove all you dumb niggas from my fuckin' fan-base
Bitch, I walk around North Lauderdale, like "Fuck err'body!"
Added my lil twist, but ain't no age on this money
Boi you fuck around with them folks, that's how Haze got his ass smoked
And what the fuck you pussy ass niggas know 'bout bein' broke?!
I can't relate, I'm trying to get more in touch with my fan base
Cause I know a lot of these poor jits is saying, "Robb Bank$ is just scrait"
"Come again?"
What I tell my Spanish lady when she speak that Daddy Yankee to my dogs
Her name "Kilo", her sister name "8-ball"
We can P.O.V if you turn up that MJG and take that ass out
Why they call em "8-balls" if they don't bounce?
All roses ain't red
And if they violets, why the fuck is them shits blue?
Boi, I'm burning purple flowers I'm finna' pass that ho to you
Cause I shouldn't be this high
Boi, I got shit to do
Sixty pills that I got to sell and I can't get my bitch out the pool
Cause she ain't never been to the islands or popped a Blue Dolphin
So she think I'm Aquaman when I fuck her ass in that water
Caught a body on my old jag, went back to the car show
Dressed in Carharrt Michigan
Fuck Big Sean though (Pussy)
Ya lil' bitch
Boi, suck my fucking dick
I bet she say "Sure" to me
And I swerve when she use her teeth
Ketchup
Marmalade and butter all up on my bread
That’s blood, copper and gold all mixed in with my money
Dopeboy pic
Flick me up while I’m still stuntin'
In that whip that I had yo bitch
My nigga, she pop the Plan-B when I'm fuckin', nigga

[Bridge]
"Fine, fine."
I say it twice to emphasize you boys is pie-pie
Put it on my mama, pussy nigga, I’ll take ya life-life
I said "I'm finer than my bitch"
She wanna live that Savage Life, so I knew that bitch was fine
(Lil' bitch)
Bank$ like to drank
Bank$ like to smoke
Bank$ finna po' the Qualitest on his 'Ports
Smoking and I'm sippin' at the same damn time
Ashley say I’m actin brand new
Damn right bitch, now I'm fine

[Verse 3: Robb Bank$]
And if I see a number I don't know, that means they want somethin’ from me
That means you stopped fuckin’ wit me, so you ain't gettin money, boi
I decline my past, turn the TV on and Ash
Might laugh while a nigga keep up wit the life of Ash
Said "I made it" when I started DMin err'day wit Cadie
Jus had mo' to speak on when she said she ain't keeping the baby
It's all gravy, wasn’t no thang but a chicken wing
Cause I done made birds fly, fiends love Popeyes
Y'all know what I do
Well, y'all know what I did, bruh
Hangin' on the roof like Bishop
Dolo, if you don count Juuce
I'm in Margate wit' my family
Boy, my hood is like a planet
If I send some 8-balls to Frieza, I bet he won't come back to Namek
I'm King Cold, bottles of King Cobra in the cooler
Roll a dutch, you smokin' L's
Boy, you a muhfuckin' loser
Chocolate tree wrap, mixed with Canada Northern Lights
Broccoli when the smoke leave the lip of that mocha
My bitch, she playin' Soca
Said she ain't like it 'til she was older
'Round twenty-eleven then we cop the douja from her friend
Bitch, show me love and a peace sign, get punani in the Benz
Last I talked to her and when
Now she complainin' to her friend
'Bout how she always first to hit me up when it's time to fuck
I tell 'er "Vibe.", Vybz Kartel, lightin' up
Bathin' in cake soap, with a tub full of money
And this new bitch pussy too nice, like it want somethin' from me
Keep it Down South wit' them mollies, boy I don't fuck around
And only a ho put another ho's name in they mouth
Now my ex-bitch too friendly, say she wanna get back wit' me
But ho I know when you kissin' Robb Bank$ and when you kissin' Richard, bitch

[Bridge]
"Fine, fine."
I say it twice to emphasize you boys is pie-pie
Put it on my mama, pussy nigga, I’ll take ya life-life
I said "I'm finer than my bitch"
She wanna live that Savage Life, so I knew that bitch was fine
(Lil' bitch)
Bank$ like to drank
Bank$ like to smoke
Bank$ finna po' the Qualitest on his 'Ports
Smoking and I'm sippin' at the same damn time
Ashley say I’m actin brand new
Damn right bitch, now I'm fine

[Outro]
...She wanted something more than "just us"
But moanin' that loud ain't doing me no justice...
Y'all forgot what real niggas look like, huh?
