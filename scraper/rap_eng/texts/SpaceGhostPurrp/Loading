[Intro]
My Name
Is...
T-E-C-H-S-F-I-N-E-S-S-E
I'm like a virus
That's in your system
I'm that loading bar
That'll never finish

[Hook]
I'm that loading bar
Fuck all yall niggas that's winning
I'm bout to take that shit Im shining
Im the nigga, from the true south bruh
Missississippi i put that on my back
Fuck a nigga that's tryna act
Im 5% you 1% my nigga yall ain't innocent

[Bridge]
New Flow

[Verse 1: Tech$ Finesse]
Spit like the master of death
I'm suppressed so I make you depressed
Get decked, set recs, and let checks fly by purposely
Stop jerkin me come and lurk with me
Lets go to a hood and start burnin trees to the third degree
Its fun and you'll learn from me
How to rap to quirky beats
And last past matters of fact behind germy cleats
Man eats a turkey's feet, come on show your perception
Forget hit detection it's all about reflection, who you repping?
I say no one, and that makes me passive?
You mean like damage I did massive
Classically actively burns classes in advances
Rancid plastic that's placid on the masses
Leave you wack last strapless backlash with flashes
Call me adaptive to jabs and that's not reactive?
An advantage is not a lament for damage
Ravage a savage with badges back-draft harasses on acid
Laxes and laxatives trap fish classless
Slashes madden Darren McFadden sadists with graphics
I'm a rabid asset to this backless attic when people panic
And I've had it with that elastic traffic when a law passes
A static laughed at an asthmatic captive
It bashes opponents like glasses
And has its proponents like a dash hit
Please create an instrumental for your mouth to suit
Cause it's incidental that your mouth is mouse poop
Not coincidental that your mental is house loop
An asylum for people to oust you
Come around boy and I'll joust you
When that fucking beat drop
Imma say some stupid shit
I dont give no fucks bruh
Y'all niggas deserved this
Y'all niggas bout to get this shit
Wait for that second verse
I'm bout to kill y'all niggas
Just wait on it

[Verse 2: Tech$ Finesse]
Im that nigga from the south-side
Waiting in line inside of my mind
Fucked up thoughts
Sterile messages minimized
What a waste of my time
Heart marinating in a brine
Fuck my inspiration for a rhyme
Need your consideration
Look me in the eyes
Your kind I despise tagged and categorized
Death toll on a rise
So many dead to me
Stay in my sights
Holdon' let me stop this rap tho
Cuz' Imma need to shout these niggas out real quick
Fuck a SMOOVESQUAD
Fuck a BLVCKVOODOO
Fuck A BLBVN
All yall niggas shitty
Fuck all yall niggas yall said was about that
My nigga yall thought was shining
My nigga bruh Ill take that back
Fuck all that bullshit
Tech$ Finesse is on this shit bruh
Yall niggas gon have to come at me
Cuz yall niggas ain't about that shit bruh
Some ghosts linger
Chose not to see the light
Ignored the middle finger
Trigger finger on the mixture
Reflection off a cold glass of liquor
Escape with me
Don't reminisce with me
Stand on the ocean floor with weights on my feet
Bubbles ascend with empty thoughts
Natural anesthesia secretes on these niggas
Secretes on these niggas

[Hook]

[Outro]
Fuck all that shit SMOOVESQUAD
Fuck all that shit yea
Gen$hin my nigga yall niggas ain't bout shit
Fuck a Bill Collector
I'm bout Repo fucking man
Yall niggas is shit
& I'm fucking winning (Rainman)
