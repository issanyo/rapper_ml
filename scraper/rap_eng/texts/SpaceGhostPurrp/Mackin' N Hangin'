[Intro]

[Verse 1 : Nell]
Mack shit, trill shit, fuck how you feel shit
Player shit, killer shit, how to get a mill' bitch
All black Cadillac coming down my fucking block
Looking for a sweet lick, 'bout to knock you niggas off
High life, smoked out, all of my niggas loced out
Green crack in the sack, spin it just to make it back
Purple drank, purple dank, loud pack make you think
Bad bitch [?] me, 75 on the [?]
Trap shit pouring up, pour that lean up in my cup
Fuck what you talking about, my niggas out here gettin' buck
Phonk shit, hit the switch, beating out the trunk bitch
Looking for a fuckin' problem, give him what he want, shit
Fired up, smoker's dank, roll to what you know you can't
Get with me, I'm pimping see, bringing it for the century
Hennessy as I inhale, stand up to my clientele
Smoking out and pouring up, pour that lean up in my cup

[Verse 2 : SpaceGhostPurrp]
Bitch I'm mackin', never slackin'
Pimp game on deal, watch me get to slapping
Laying bitches in they face when they start cappin'
All about that cash, why you think a nigga rappin' ?
What happened? Bitch, I thought you ass clap
But I know damn well that ain't what your ass about
The drought, is what ya'll niggas in cause ya'll broke as hell
We hustle deep and leave it drought like a wishing will
Man I swear to God I will never tell
B.M.W. are in, can't you fucking spell ?
Keep the block hot, with my nigga Nell
That's a G-spot and I'mma hit it well
Fuck niggas dwell, and try to blackmail
I stack my money up and I should never tell
I gotta go hard, she a freaky girl
She going hard for the team, Black Money World

[Outro]
