[Verse 1]
Just a young ass nigga not giving a fuck
'Cause if I ever did I'd be wifing her up
My heart real black, I don't trust a bitch
I hate this fucking world, y'all can suck my dick
If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense
But never use a nigga just to get too rich
I always try to smile, but the world is fake
The world is a house with a yard full of snakes
I don't have money, I don't have cars
All I got is the truth and a couple of bars
All I need is a beat and some O to the E
Destroying competition 'cause the style is unique
My patience real short, so just walk in my shoes
My mind fucked up, mentally too abused
Don't accuse me to be a nigga who hate
I always show love, from city to state
So ride real slow as I murder the sound
The screaming in the back represent Hell's grounds
These niggas love to hate, see 'em eyeing me down
Progression is a blessing, you ain't slowing me down
All I know is real shit, and I cannot lie
Me and my fucking goddess, rolling side by side
Look me in my fucking eye, and feel my pain
As I shed blood, tears, as they spell your name

[Hook]
Rest In Peace Jitt nigga
Keep your motherfucking head up
It's a cold world nigga
I know that everybody fed up
Rest In Peace Jitt nigga
Keep your motherfucking head up
It's a cold world nigga
I know that everybody fed up

[Verse 2]
I be the one for sure, you know just what it is
Recognition is the mission, let me handle my biz
My peers hold it down for the klan of the youth
Idolizing all the women when I spit in the booth
The truth has been written when I sit in the coupe
As I spill every thrill on the waviest loops
I know just how it feel not to have any loot
Tired of the same clothes, tired of eating the soup
I be the B-L-A-C-right-to-the-K
Power of the hour, like every day
What can I say?
You better believe in what you see
Deception, no reception, just leave it to me
I gotta be nobody else but myself
Gotta feed the whole fam, gotta gather my wealth
My shelf
Is full of dollar bills and pills
If you got that connect, take me right to the mills

[Outro]
It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power
It's all about power, it's all about power, bitch
