[Hook x2: Yung Simmie]
Fake niggas don't know realer, real shit from a real nigga
Don't fuck with gold diggers, I don't know no ho niggas
Florida nigga mentality, Florida nigga mentality
Florida nigga mentality, I beat the pussy babality

[Verse 1: Yung Simmie]
Off in the hood with Curry the killer
Nigga talk stupid, I'm calling my nigga
Blackland thuggin', Raider Klan muggin'
Ain't talking money, ain't talking bout nothin'
Florida mentality, nigga babality
I beat the pussy, she go to sleep happily
Money and family, nigga no gravity
Laughing at niggas who thinking they fly as me
Then if he trying me, we go to war
Miami niggas stomp heads to the floor
He don't want no more, fist in his face
Florida mentality don't fuck with fake
Spit in the face of a nigga who fake
Spit in the face of a bitch who act stank
Fuck what you think, I'mma do me
Florida mentality, now you see

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Black Money World, this B.R.K
Fuck bad bitches, like erry'day
Straight popping bottles, we fucking models
We live the life, by staying fwea'
That southside of that F.L.A
Where niggas die like erry'day
These hoes shone all on my phone
And I ain't tryna' give a ho no play
Gotta get paid, we don't hate
Fuck niggas hate, so get it straight
Money World, we in the place
Throw the money up, it elevate
Riding slow in the black coupe
I slide through, I escalate
I'm a young nigga straight getting cake
My pockets holding a lot of weight
