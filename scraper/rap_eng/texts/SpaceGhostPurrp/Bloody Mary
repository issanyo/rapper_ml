[Chorus: SpaceGhostPurrp] x 3
Gold Bloody Mary chain, with the red ruby
And I'm running through your bitch
Like scooby dooby

[Verse 1: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Just a young ass nigga, looking good in this bitch
Understood when I spit, Shawdy gettin on my dick
I'm the mothafucking shit, nigga how you ain't know?
Trendsetter of the year, three times in a row
But I do it on the low
Gotta make the money grow
Lil momma wanna be with me, but she wanna know
If i got another girl on the mothafucking side
And i say, "Hell yeah, I cut her off, you be my wife"
I like the way you mothafucking look
When you look me in my eyes, i can read you like a book
So look, tell your home girls that you finna leave
Cuz we got somewhere to be
I got moves up my sleeve
Yeah, Nigga finna be iced up, doing me
While the shawty be like, "Me and him is meant to be"
I be the GOD to these niggas, Man I swear they worship me
I'm a hero, she like zero, Cuz I swear she digging me

[Chorus] x 4

[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Elohim soldier Yahweh's own
You are not a Arab, Israel is yo' home
Shalom, to the holy East, bless me
I'm Jacob and Isaac and Abraham's Seed
Weed? Hell naw I dont smoke that shit
