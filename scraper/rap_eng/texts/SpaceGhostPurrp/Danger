Your body
Danger
That booty, you a beauty
Danger, that pussy
So hot, make a nigga yell
Danger, your body
You a beauty
Danger, that booty

Danger, your body, your body
Danger, that booty
You a beauty
Danger, that pussy
So hot, make a nigga yell
Danger, your body
You a beauty

[Verse 1]
N-n-n-n-newborn skin
Smooth like the ass on a baby, you a ten
Baby, let's sin
You a good girl, but you bad on gin
I won't tell a friend
Between me and you, again and again
We get it in a Benz
Perfume perfect, baby girl, hurt me
Hair so curly
Baby make it straight, as I pull it and tug it
In the shower I'm sucking
The water off your body as it drip, you love it
The way you put it on me
Body so amazing, moving like a whirlwind
I love your girlfriend
She love me, we can be best friends
Kinda like a weddin'
Bachelor party, I'mma be the best man
Two girls wrestlin'
Kissin' and lustin', put that shit on Instagram
Baby, you be going ham
Momma not around, now you grown, you don't give a damn
Pussy wetter than a dam
Taking out my anger
Your body in danger

So hot, make a nigga yell

[Verse 2]
You can run with the steez, baby girl OG
Original Goddess, you could levitate the beat
The way you move, energy and hella heat
Competition ain't shit, broke hoes can't compete
Elite physique, baby girl too unique
Her style is wild, magical and mystique
I beat every hit that you throw at me
So I catch it and bless it and made you leak
You weak in between the beautiful thighs
Got me hypnotized with the beautiful eyes
Caught by surprise when I sneak behind
That ass with class as she wind and grind
Baby you a star, it's your time to shine
Singing on the microphone, moaning nice and fine
Mouth you mind, baby I ain't cuffing
Keep it on the hush, baby don't say nothing
Pretty girl with a attitude from Compton
Mind of a goddess who was raised in London
Moving to the beat, you invisible humpin'
Ass like M.J., it stay jumpin'
I'm whole grade, give me the luncheon
Say my grace, and pray, and munchin'
You my distraction, I can't function
Girl I'm patient, just keep on cummin'
