Purp out the pack I’ve been smoking till I can’t
Earth on my map I’ve been swerving in a tank

Dust mites pockets on tongue tide/ bust five/ gun range on sight/ fuck lames/ lungs fried/ I vibe u stand by/ I decide/ till death due us part/ just me in my art/ give it for something my something is heart/ ain’t it disgusting the way that they start/ invest in the bluffing they fronting so hard/ made from assumptions they tuck in they cards/ ain’t coming with onions they funions with parts/ ain’t accustomed to custums they accustomed to darts/ missing they mark apart of the village living with sharks/ raised ina scrimmage/ militant civilians deep in they arc/ gonna buy the Lil park/ give the vibe a lil spark/ why is life still hard/ Ima live it up till I can feel the charts/ if it is kin it is me u charge/ into this pen I give to god/

Purp out the pack I’ve been smoking till I can’t
Earth on my map I’ve been swerving in a tank x2
Purp out the pack I’ve been burning all my gas
Searched for the trap/ I’ve been learning to relapse x2

Digereedoo into digable planet/ into the views/ floor forty two/ out in a pool/ out in the drought blowing a fuse/ hoping that u/ angel in me/ will show me the proof/ that what I see isn’t the the truth/ Lil bo peep was really the wolf/ commanding a fleet all from a booth/ fucking ur bitch/ flood the abyss/ all this for a reason to live/ lord season my gift/ of course it’s courtside were I best think/ jetlife dreams bed side scenes Crome gleam infrared beam/ all for my team/ all for my team/ love you mom ur all that I need/ pick of the litter/ they fill up the filter they filled up with filters/ they think that they differ/ they give into shivers/ my chivalry withers/ they bars full of shots I know they mean liquor/ they pussies all quiver/ I’m rick as a pickle/ they into the fickle/ they fiddle with devils they simple I’m better/ they tremble in tension/ I treasure the pressure/ the lesson a gesture/ a weapon the shredder/ whenever the better/ cheddar get her wetter/ Brock lesnar pop up alka seltzer/ doc oc with a sawed off and Kevlar sweater/ ur in a stretcher close to the ether/ hand out I bet ya/ betting heaven will help ya/ this ain’t effort ya

My life went and shifted
That’s why I’m blowing RX yeah prescription
