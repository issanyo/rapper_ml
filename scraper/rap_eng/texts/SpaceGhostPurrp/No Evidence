Throw it out the window
No evidence
It's all about knowledge
Body-countin dead presidents

[Intro] (2x)
Throw it out the window (no evidence, no evidence, no evidence)
Throw it out the window (no evidence, it's all about knowledge
Dead presidents)

[Intro 2] (4x0
Feel what I'm talking 'bout
Keep up with my mind
Keep up with my mind

[Verse 1]
It's the mack daddy, mister player, coming through with three
Raider Klan niggas that be putting on with them
Slim Jim baby I'm a skinny nigga too
Jim is the bank, lifting cash is the weight too
Tunnel after tunnel walking finding destiny
I'm a child with the mild, spicy recipe
Back in '98 had the gold frame locs hated
Elementary school to me was a joke
Provoked, subject to influence by the ring leader
Make a run with my bat like Derek Jeter
Reaper black hoodie, looking like a fly creeper
Mystical bass vibrating like a beeper
Off in your ear don't fear baby here
Put your hand in my hand, and get up out of here
I'm weird, it ain't hard to see yeah I know it
My mind is hella freak and I ain't scared to show it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Audition politician you would never ever get in
Faggot ass hypebeasts will never ever fit in
Get it, how you fucking live like a rebel
Power over basic minds, you just a pebble
Treble, turned up perfect with the bass
Listen to the weight it blows right through your face
Win, now I shall begin
Start a raging storm with the Phonk from within
Again and again, this is how we do it
Not Montell Jordan, Muney Jordan Luther stupid
I do this, for my Raider niggas who've been through it
Fucking with these bitches, stay away from the cutest
Who this calling on my phone? Miss Jones
A sassy college teacher that I met who love to bone
I'm grown, fuck a friend I'd rather be alone
I'm better off having an orgy waking up with shones

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
One last verse
And I won't try to curse
Let me maintain
My brain
Fuck it I just got worse
I need to be deep just because I am a
Walking rapping drugged poisonous dillema
I'm like dinner when I be all up in her stomach
The lyrical disease made you bleed then vomit
Atomic bass zooming in like Sonic
Up in Seattle, too phonkey like chronic
Bang bang bang, pop pop, [?]
I'm all about decession and profession, fuck a cop
I'm not a fake thug cause they be lollipops
[?] still get fucked while they make their cherry pop
Stop the bullshit, faking up the Phonk
Gorillas in my city, they be stinking in the trunk
Drunk, off Hennessy is a [?]
Living life to the fullest, you will die before you blink

[Hook]

Throw it out the window, no evidence
It's all about knowledge body counting dead presidents (4x)
