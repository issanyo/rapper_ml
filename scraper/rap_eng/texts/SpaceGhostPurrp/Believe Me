[Hook]

If a nigga talking shit, lying on me like a bitch
Man he lying man you gotta believe me
If I say I'm down with you, Imma kill, fight for you
I ain't lying yo you gotta believe me
If I say you my girl, you the woman of my world
Me and you girl you gotta believe me
If I mean what I say and I say what I mean
I ain't lying bitch you gotta believe me
Believe me
Believe me
You gotta believe me
Believe me

[Verse 1]

Don't believe what a nigga say
Niggas love to talk shit, Niggas love to hate
Tryna make a nigga fall, make a nigga fake
I'm the type of nigga let you eat up off my plate
If I see my nigga down I'mma lift him up
Never will I see you fall, I'mma help you bruh
Niggas stay talking shit, I don't get it bruh
Smiling all in my face, tryna doll me up
I'll never cross a nigga, never set him up
Never turn my back on him when shit rough
Niggas wanna be hard, wanna act tough
And cry like a lil' bitch when they locked up
Imma tell you 'bout my niggas, they don't talk much
If you fuck around with me, they'll shoot you up
If I say I got your back then you gotta trust
A motherfucker like me, I don't act bruh
I don't act bruh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

If I say you my girl, then girl I mean that
The only one in my world so just believe that
If she ain't fucking with you, I know she see that
She wanna see us go at it so I can leave that
Pretty face, woman who loyal and ass fat
Intelligent, graduated, girl I love that
And ain't no other bitch who gon' be above that
Stop tripping baby girl; where my hug at ?
Them niggas looking at yo' ass, I'mma grab that
So I can make them niggas wish they could have that
Let em' hate, they just mad cuz I got your back
Never let a nigga tell you that they own that
And if a nigga tell you that, tell 'em fall back
Tell 'em put his money back, you don't need that
I wanna stay by your side 'cuz you need that
I ain't playing baby girl, yeah believe that
