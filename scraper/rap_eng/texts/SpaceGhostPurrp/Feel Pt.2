[Hook]
Tell me what you feel when I place your lips to mine
Tell me what you feel when I keep your heart in mind
Tell me what you feel when I place your lips to mine
Tell me what you feel when I keep your heart in mind
[Verse 1]
We breathe together to the tempo
Gotta let go from the get-go (yeah)
I see way better when I’m kissen on ya
Huggen on ya body with my eyes closed (yeah)
I dream of another world where we
Didn’t have to follow every schedule, but
Alas you got class in the mornen so you
Gotta put your boots on (damn)
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Feels good to have a lady I can care about
No matter where our whereabouts
Can’t resist wearen out that inside
Beautiful, just like your soul
We let the bass tell us where to go
Keep it on the low
Somehow those bitches know [you occupy that space]
Left your mark all on the wall [Just to say this spot was chosen]
What a cozy place to fall
In love that conquers all
Except when duty calls and then
I’m waiten on your booty call
[Hook]
