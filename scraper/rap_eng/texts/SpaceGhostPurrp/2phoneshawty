[Verse 1]
Aye
And you might catch me laughing
Spent summer with Nuri
Recording year of the savage in a mansion
I stunt like my daddy
Two hundred dollar fanta
Yall bitch made
I spit game
PaRappa the Rapper
You going backwards
I dont get it
Can't remember the last time I didn't get mentioned
Yall know who it is and im on bond bitch
Im like that ugly ass joint in my whip
Sick and im twisted
Thats expected from the contender
Im the three time champ
Still competing against myself
Aye these niggas get upset
Talkin' em on they cell
Forget we started at the same time but i ain't never ask for help
Not to mention, yo' bitch keep textin'
Keep covering your nipples in these pictures
We cannot further this friendship
Black twitter veteran
Bleeding hearts club membership
New prejudice
S'all confederate
Yachts like a slave ship
No need for emancipation
And that pussy so good deserve a letter of recommendation
What you sayin' i never been the one to play with
I Still shoot the shit like meaningless conversation
Me and the actress who do the voice of Sakura started dating
And Sam from Totally Spies became my booking agent
Satan do my PR
My managers God
I'm hittin' J's in the elevator like Solange
I come from a time
Where the wave that washed ya'll niggas up
In this bitch first, made the water ripple
I become one with nature
Ill align the stars
Just to make sure that I get the pussy from her
Boy, and none of my niggas feel you
Plain and simple
If i say kill em
Someone gone kill em
Indigo kill em
Pou kill em
Neil gone kill em
Two M's next to 6 like Margiela
I had a prom where we were supposed to feel ya
Bitch
Im still a wobo nigga
Fo' fo's in a motherfuckin' four door nigga
Dertbag polo nigga
In the city dolo nigga
A few crumbs try to act like the whole slice
I could smell the yeast on ya clit nigga
When you see that lex pull up to the farm store, shit
You know exactly who the fuck it is nigga

[Hook x2]
Aye 2phoneshawty aye
I bet they'll suck the dick
Before her ass call me
Nigga 2phone
Boy she on my dick
You kissed that bitch
And she sucked my dick nigga
Im the one that get the money
Got all these hoes on me
Make your bitch love me
And i leave her lonely
Nigga who want it
The one and only
Young nigga stay stuntin' boy
Im runnin' round the lobby
Dont tell Mr. Moseby

[Verse 2]
Ice cold baby
Let me rub a cube on ya
I run it, the track can feel like colombine high school
I poured a pint In a tub
Breathtaking, bruh
Put a out of town bitch on oxygen that's bad girls club
And they watch me they love me
Keep up with my moves
Follow what i do
But who the fuck is you
Can't remember the last time a bitch asked for my name
I listened to ya mixtape and felt like i was gettin' pranked
Aye
To all the fuck bitches realer than these niggas
You bought a gun to take pictures
I hold a tommy, Didi pickles
And we wit' it
Why you think we flow too much, chakra
I look round broward
I ain't even know I made these clones
Bitch im war ready like i got on my old clothes
I was just on yo' front porch
When i dropped off yo ho
Yo new girl she so-so
I dont bunk with the piper
Get snatched, bars
For these pussies
Orange is the new black

[Hook x2]
Aye 2phoneshawty aye
I bet they'll suck the dick
Before her ass call me
Nigga 2phone
Boy she on my dick
You kissed that bitch
And she sucked my dick nigga
Im the one that get the money
Got all these hoes on me
Make your bitch love me
And i leave her lonely
Nigga who want it
The one and only
Young nigga stay stuntin' boy
Im runnin' round the lobby
Dont tell Mr. Moseby

[Verse 3]
2phoneshawty, please say the shawty
I'll beat the duck out ya, I ain't Alley Boy, homie
I'm cooler than a cool kid, i feel like chuck i feel like Mikey
I'll get your not as fresh as fuck
And knock goes everything around it
I'm laid up with your bitch watching AHS
Using your account on Netflix
I need the motivation so boy keep talking shit
And calendars is dead but don't make a  boy miss it
Fuck XXL, I'm a Forbes list nigga
I have Fxrbes come and record this nigga
Lil mamma clean house scrub ground uncle Lou
I'll have Luk come and record this nigga
Let me stab it on the plastic like Dexter
Fucking on ya grand-mama couch
Yeah I can work the camera
Highschool I used to do the morning announcement
And I already done the counting
Fuck you talmbout bitch
Flexing in that pussy while i pan it to the left
I'mma movie buff, boy
You too nuff, call 911 foreign bitch call 119
Boy, I make Molly call 365
Ten five percent
Swing the bottle with your ex
Eyes on everybody else paper like a test
Only Skin Head with a fucking re-twist
