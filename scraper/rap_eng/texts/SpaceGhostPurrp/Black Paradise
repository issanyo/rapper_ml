[Verse 1: Skip Rage]
All black everything, yeah, welcome to my dark side
It's midnight, I'm puffing loud in my g-ride
Headed downtown to a party with my whole team
Codeine, sipping dirty Sprite got me so leaned
We mobbing deep, so deep, look like we gang banging
But we just macking pretty, gold teeth & chains hanging
Jacket Mcqueen, I'm a fiend for that high fashion
Skull and bones stubbs & wooten ,call it fly passion
Soon as I walk up inside, the bitches greet me
Asking for a pimp number, nah bitch tweet me
Ran into Purrp, told him I got some bad bitches with me
And they all down to fuck, then he was like, really?

[Verse 2: Skip Rage]
We downstairs underground, where we parlay
My niggas rolling up and all my bitches doing molly
We gon' party
In Manhattan, but I'm representing Queens
Lost boyz, rebel swag, see them grips up in my jeans
It's pimping in my genes
That's in my blood, even my grandpapa was a G
Man this pimp hand was so mean, ha
Return of the mack, no I never left
If you think I'm falling off then you must be smoking meth
Im wanted like a parolee ,on the run from axel foley
Got bitches in Beverly Hills out to get this money for me
Shaft! they ask my name, it's Skip Rage
But you don't get a dime, I'm taking everything, that pimp wage, yeah
