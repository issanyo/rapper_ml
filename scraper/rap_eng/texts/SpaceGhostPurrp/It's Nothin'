We be turnin' up the club, boy, it's nothin' (boy, it's nothin')
If you fuck around with us, you get stomped quick (you get stomped quick)

[Verse 1: Nell]
Fuckin' with us, you will meet the maker, I am the undertaker
My niggas is riding, leavin' 'em shakin', Anita Baker
This is how I sic 'em, after the green, I rake 'em
Chasing the cream, me and my team'll beat the Lakers
These niggas ain't tryin' to see it, but even the blind believin'
That we on the rise this season, you don't need your eyes to peep it
Know you niggas tired of sleeping, catching a rep trying to beat this
Ride for my set, you come around and get wet
Little nigga, what you about? We'll get you stomped out

[Verse 2: Rell]
Cop a pack to get faded, these bitches is overrated
So I'mma slide with my Raiders, as you remaining outdated
Got to process a payment, where the bank at? I raid it
To cop a bottle and rape it, taking shots, ain't no saving
The young'n mugging, we bumping, feel the bass from the pavement
At any club got it jumping, supporters repeat my statements
Where the wealth? Fuck the famous
Stop provoking the faking
You want the drama? We dangerous
ODF got the bangers, bitch

[Verse 3: Yung Simmie]
Forever I'm turnin' up, forever I'm thinkin' bucks
The nigga who give no fucks, the nigga with all-black Chucks
Got stomped cause we turnin' up, them Raiders is heatin' up
I walk in and bag a bitch, that Raider Klan savage shit
I'm so above average and never under pressure, it's whatever
I'm off the top, bad bitches and my niggas
When bottles pop in this section, we chillin', it ain't no stressin'
If shit pop off, I got the weapon

[Hook x4: Spaceghostpurrp]

[Verse 4: Spaceghostpurrp]
We be turned up for real bitch, no flexin'
Swear to God, on Jitt boy, we get wreckless
Hella hoes on me, pussy poppin'
Niggas lookin' sour cause they know it ain't stoppin'
I'm poppin' bottles on your ho
Bitch, I am so rude, I spilled it on your clothes
We stay sellin' out shows, she can't keep her mouth closed
Cause we throwin' zeroes
