[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Feel like this nigga, Drake scared as fuck
Cause I fucked up the world and I don't give a fuck
See back in 2010, see the world wasn't like this
Everybody was jerkin', everybody was happy, bitch
But 2011 came, I fucked up the world, then I made it darker, mane
All people, lord infamous this for you
Man, fuck the world, man, this shit for you
I'mma make the world fucked up and black
Everybody gon' walk around in black
Attack, hit a nigga with the AK
Fuck around with me, man, I guaranteed you sprayed
You layin' on the fuckin' ground
Goddamn, boy I know you head the sound
That the four pound are aim at ya head
Yeah, you bloody red then ya pussy ass dead, nigga

[Hook 1]
I thought I told y'all niggas
I thought I told y'all bitch ass nigga
I thought I told y'all niggas
I thought I told y'all fuck ass nigga
I thought I told y'all some fat ass, dick in the mouth nigga
I thought yo muthafuckin' lame ass pussy ass nigga

[Verse 2]
Now I'm the same fuckin' nigga that came out with blacklandradio 66.6
We livin' in hell, but no, this ain't hell, but now this shit is hell, bitch
But I believe in y'all, wait, but, I know I'm on Satan grounds, but I'm on hell's ground
Make the world burn, make the world burn
And I don't give a fuck, this what you earned
Bitch, I don't concern about you fuck nigga
In a minute this muthafuckas gettin' 'em bucks, nigga
Drake like "Goddamn, man, it gettin' darker"
Bitch, I know, I'm the reason why it's gettin' darker
Bitch, keep dumpin' these hoes, keep fuckin' these fuck niggas up
They I stop they ass with my Timberland boots
Then I got my muthafuckin' boot on they face
You already know, man, this gun they gon' taste

[Hook 2]
Keep on playin' with me you ol' bitch, bitch ass pussy ass nigga
Keep on underestimatin' a nigga, nigga like me you fuck nigga

[Outro]
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
The world is mine, but I ain't Scarface, and this ain't no movie and I ain't atlas, aye
