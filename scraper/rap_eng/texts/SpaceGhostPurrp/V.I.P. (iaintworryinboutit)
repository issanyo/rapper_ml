Throwing bottles in the club, nigga I ain't worried 'bout it
Turnt' up like a fuck, nigga I ain't worried 'bout it
Main bitch gon' suck me up, nigga I ain't worried 'bout it
If you hating on me bruh', nigga I ain't worried 'bout it, no
I ain't worried 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it bitch
I ain't worried 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it, let's go
I ain't worried 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it, let's go
I ain't worried 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it, let's go

[Verse 1]
Stickin' in this bitch, and they smoking on some stanky stanky
Yeah we getting rich, with them bands ? banky banky
And we will never snitch, but we boiling like the bowl of gravy
You irrelevant, you ain't fucking like my main lady
She be sucking dick, like a vacuum cleaner, cleaning lady
? shit, telling me she wanna have my baby
Bitch I am legit, and my squad deeper than the navy
I look innocent, but my soul always drive me crazy
This ain't counterfeit, all this money and your bitch gon' pay me
Yeah she was a trick, she a dime, she will never play me
I ain't rushing shit, bitch I'm patient and you know I'm waiting
Got her stacking chips, like them dope dealers in the eighties
Riding in the whip, niggas smoking and we vibing crazy
I ain't gotta trip, I know god gon' forever save me
I'm just tryna' flip, she a goddess and she wanna rape me
Bitch I am a pimp, and I keep a bitch right on the daily
