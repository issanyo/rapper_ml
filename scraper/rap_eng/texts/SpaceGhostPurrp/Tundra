[Lil Baphomet]
As the mother fucking devils walking through my mind
I wonder why I loyalty so hard to find?
Its too hard to keep it real, its too easy to lie
Lately all I do is focus on my grind

I had to get my past and leave it all behind
I had to add fuel to the fire just to make it shine
Lately all my thoughts have been so genocidal
And thinking 'bout fucking up your face so they can't identify you

Mane I taught you how to climb right out of the slime
Funny how now I'm watching your ass rewind
Mane to me its so funny watching you die as my goons light you up like its the 4th of July

See I'm from a place where humans can't survive like a radioactive tundra covered in ice
Can't be too nice when you out in these streets 'cos niggas trying to eat, and we carry heat

You're a dead piece of meat, we will not bury you
We'll leave your punk ass dead and cold on the concrete
I don't accept defeat so please don't step to me
I know these niggas snakes, I hear the rattling

Mother fuck all of these bitches and they families
Ho I'll grab the torch and burn down the whole family tree
Dog I ain't your boy I am your fucking enemy
We be plaguing mother fuckers like we a disease

Bitch I'm burning up bodies - inhaling the fumes
Got me feeling so crazy wondering who I'mma shoot next
Blue lips on the new bitch in the trunk of my new whip
I'm plucking mother fuckers like a tulip
Loose lips running I'mma cut them bitches off, throw 'em in the furnace burn em now I cannot speak at all
Feeling so crazy I'm feeling so lost in the depths of my mind surrounded by these walls
Universe on my back so I can't even crawl
Roll it up smoke a sack then I hear Satan's call
Smoke in my jaw as he tells me my mission - to kill all you bitches leave bodies in trenches. Need weed for the stenches and give dick to the wenches then burn all the bridges I need to get back. Bag full of riches gon' blow on a pack so I'm taking the bricks that he keep in his shack
