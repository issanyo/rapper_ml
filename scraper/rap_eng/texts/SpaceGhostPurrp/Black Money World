[Verse 2]
She was watchin' me the whole time
I was turnin' left the whole time
Then I looked that bitch all in her eyes
Then she told me something by surprise
"Meet me at the hotel on the last floor"
Then I told her "Fa' Sho', baby you already know"
She was like 5'6", pretty face, skinny thick
Tellin' me she love me when I hit her with the dick
Real quick, she came, she screaming my name
And her ass so fat, wetter than a hurricane
She claim, that I'm the one but hoes be running game
So I put her on my team, now we making money mane
Bitch it's Black Money World, Rubber Band Money Gang
Free my young nigga Doe, and the 6 running thangs
Im a playa ass nigga, nothin' but a mack thang
And yo' bitch love my slang, SGP run the game
