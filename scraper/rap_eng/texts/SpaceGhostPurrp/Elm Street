[Verse 1]

You gotta be the God of Black, you gotta take over the nation
You gotta be real, gotta be trill, gotta do it for the generation
[?] (all black) and make sure they all flashy
Teach these girls how to be a goddess, similar to Janet Jackson
Gotta be the God of Black, and make sure niggas ain't phony
'Cuz if them niggas talk behind your back then they ain't your motherfuckin' homies
Gotta keep making stacks, it's all about motherfuckin' money
And feedin yo', family, and fuckin' these snow bunnies

[Hook]

Gotta keep my mind on my dough [x4]
Gotta keep my mind on [x3]
(Motherfucker)

[Verse 2]

We'll be filthy rich, shittin' on a lot of politicians
Big mansion, private beach, household full of bad bitches
We'll have every bitch (I wan't 'em all), and all the money in the planet
All you gotta do is get a wish and G-O-D will grant it
We gon' save the world (that's right), and make sure we stay trill
It's a lot of fakes, it's a lot of snakes, that ain't too real
Nigga you the God of Black, you can have all the millions
Fuck these motherfuckin' haters, fuck they motherfuckin' feelings

[Hook]
