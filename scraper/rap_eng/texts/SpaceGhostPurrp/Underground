[Verse 1]
This ain't no bullshit
This ain't no J.Cole, Rock And Roll
It's that raider shit
Coming from Downtown
Stacking my money down
You mix-tape rappers won't survive in the underground
Cause Space nigga is the Ghost
Fucking from coast to coast
Nigga don't learn
He'll get burn, like some french toast
Don't even get close
To me with that bullshit
Live your life slow
Or die fast from the bullet, bitch
Niggas they full of it
Acting like goons shit
How you a thug and its 2011, bitch?
Niggas can't get a job
Because of my President
Won't hire me cuz I'm black
And they prejudice
That's just irrelevant
That's why I wear all black
If I ain't a raider, bitch?
Then what do you call that?
They say that I'm underrated
They gettin' hot to the sound
Fuck all you wack rappers!
Who won't survive in the motherfucking underground


[Hook]:
Ground, ground(hide down)
Ground, ground(hide down)
Ground, ground(hide down)
Who won't survive to the underground
Ground, ground(hide down)
Ground, ground(hide down)
Ground, ground(hide down)
Who won't survive in the underground
Ground, ground(hide down)
Ground, ground(hide down)
Ground, ground(hide down)
Who won't survive in the underground
Ground, ground(hide down)
Ground, ground(hide down)
Ground, ground(hide down)


[Verse 2]
Trill, i got you
Jane, i got you
Mick, i got you
Lou, i got you too
And bitch, I'm from Miami
Where niggas stay dolo-olo, and never (?)
Cause niggas cut throat
Rest in piece, my nigga Jitt from 18th Block
Why he had to go?
And never wife a ho, If you like her
Cause If you ever skeet in that bitch
Then that's your life, bruh
You only got one life, bruh
Keep your head to the sky
With the joint and the lighter
So pull-up smokin harder
And cut this volume up
So yo ass could get higher (TOASTY!)
And I will not retire
Til the rap game, go back straight like a wire
So get high to my sounds
And tell these rappers
They won't survive in the motherfucking underground

[Outro]
Ay my nigga
I wanna give a motherfucking shoutout
To my motherfuckin little brother
