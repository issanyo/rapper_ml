[Intro]
Ice, ice, ice, my niggas take your life
Ice, ice, ice, my niggas take your life
Ice, ice, ice, my niggas take your life
Ice, ice, ice, my niggas take your life

[Hook]
Whole latta ice, I got a whole latta ice
I'm finna' take your wife, my niggas take your life
Whole latta ice, I got a whole latta ice
I'm finna' take your wife, my niggas take your life
Whole latta ice, whole latta ice
I got a whole latta ice
I'm finna' take your wife, my niggas take your life

[Verse 1]
Yeah it's me, and bitch I came back
Bentley, don't need no Maybach
Remember me, because you played that
MTV, they see that God of black
Lyrically, I flow like a heart attack
So crazy, I'm throwed like a quarterback
Don't play me, my killers will handle that
So lazy, I'm smoking on purple sack
We laugh slow motion, gone off this potion
Nigga gotta get rich, so I gotta keep flowing
Y'all niggas ain't knowing, which way I'm going
Now she open, bad bitch she smoking, nigga know what it is
Know I ain't joking, all black like Oakland
Her head go dumb but her brain still focused, that hokus-pokus
That pussy magic I be stroking
Who you provoking? Nigga you be acting
Got you hoping, that a nigga won't find you, let a nigga remind you
That you not untouchable, she fuckable and she mine too

[Hook]
Whole latta ice, I got a whole latta ice
I'm finna' take your wife, my niggas take your life
Whole latta ice, I got a whole latta ice
I'm finna' take your wife, my niggas take your life
Whole latta ice, whole latta ice
I got a whole latta ice
I'm finna' take your wife, my niggas take your life
