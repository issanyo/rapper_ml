[Hook: J.K. The Rapper]

Killa Killa Killa
Im the fucking Son Of Sam son of satan
Shout out to the mother fucking raiders
These other rap niggas
Turned fag wearing makeup
Tell em fuck em all till they hate us

[Verse 1: J.K. The Rapper]
Bitch I think I'm based god hoes on my dick cause I look like Oprah
Fuck a name gang fang sharper then a cobra
Chilling on my sofa
Watching beavis and butthead
These underground rappers don't get enough cred
Fuck it we might as well come up and and rape the industry
No matter your opinion your gonna remeber me making history
Fucking up the whole of facade
Of the these rap niggas thats so soft
But swearing they go go hard
Its so odd I'm fucking up these niggas future
Ask drake what his favorite color is fuchsia
Fucking faggot fairy tales fucking up the frail mind of the ignorant
See it on tv and they surely get in to it
I'm more interested in that triple 6 mafia riding in the chevy bumping lord infamous
Know I'm high really high first verse is the shit bitch
But thats something you wouldn't get

[Hook: J.K. The Rapper]

Still yelling fuck em all till they hate us

Killa Killa Killa
Im the fucking Son Of Sam son of satan
