Will power dried up/ my mind stay tied up/ feel likeI’m psyduck/ why would they design us/ can’t explain the virus/ programmer hid inside us/
We are born then we die
In a storm won’t be fine
It’s all porn pesticides
All so torn dead inside
Will power Midas/ my mind will climb up/ feel so righteous/ my purpose to enlighten/ of course we came with guidance/ good god hid inside us/
We are born then we shine
Feel the warmth it’s alright
Ur r adored cuz ur alive
All from source feel the vibe

It’s either is or it isn’t
Ride them waves with persistence
