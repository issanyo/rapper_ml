[Intro]

[Verse: Amber London]
Everybody want to, be a Raider
We the creators, can't nothing fade us, ain't nothing made up
You carrying cater, and can say that we haters as we ride
Got these niggas feeling all laid up, straight up
I grab my pistol, and cock it
My niggas be on that hot shit, killing cause they ain't got shit
Why they quick to switch the topic when it come to getting paper?
My flow straight heat, turn these bitch niggas to vapor
I see you later
I got my eye on the prize, should I lie
You can tell by the size of lie, I get high
My my my, they got me whipping up pies, I sold dope
The way I go I got the shit in the skies, there's no hope
They got you up against the rope
Cali dope what I smoke
2.7.5 ho, we got to get dough, it's no joke
I can't go broke because my niggas need me
Got them at the 40 freezing, so nigga take it easy

[Hook x2: Dough2x]
Hot like the core, burn like a sore
New Glock named Lion, don't make her roar
Hollows, good lord
No muzzle on (no, no)
No muzzle on

[Verse 2: Nell]
Up in this bitch like I'm XXX, coming down with the set
Fuck is you talking 'bout, watch your mouth cause I'm gripping next
Stripping your silhouette, for respect I stay in the jex
Out the land of the darkness, my whole hood Trayvon Martin
Straight out that water the Loch Ness
Coming to flood your block in
How the fuck you gon' stop sin?
Niggas busting, you dropping
You locked in the cemetary
More money and hella Mary, Jane, you can't contain the pain that's trapped in my vain
Deranged, you niggas hoes
'Bout that time I expose, the rat, talking to them peoples and get back
Know the niggas foes
So now I'm just cutting up
These niggas ain't as tough, as they seem yeah they powderpuff
Had enough now he out of luck
Bitch I'm clutching it's nothing, toting that rocket and rushing
Any nigga cross me I'm touching, one it's soul, no discussing
Leaving him hot to the core, brains on the floor
Tint from the mack, he get one in the back, and get left on the shore

[Hook x2: Dough2x]
