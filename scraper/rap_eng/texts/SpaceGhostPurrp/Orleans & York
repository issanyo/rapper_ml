[Intro]
Mic check

[Verse]
Been gifted from the beginning
Still got a leaky ceiling
Friends say that I'm too revealing
They think I should start concealing
Like I was never caught stealing
Well fuck your feelings
You'll be sitting back & chilling
When I make a killing
Now check it
Sometimes I think I should be dealing
I know fools who do that shit & need that shit
It ain’t exactly rocket science
A honest day's work is quickly on the path of dying
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want some of those assignments
Lord knows I'm trying to not head down that path though
It’s really tempting cash flow
When you’re always dead ass broke
Shit’s a hassle
But if I did the opposite I’d kill myself
Guilt & torment would overshadow apparent wealth
The truth just hits me like a parent’s belt
Always seem to struggle, now I truly know how Tricia & Darren felt
This is how I’ve been for too many years
Feeding off fears, jeers from peers
But crashing like I’m King Lear cause I’m...

[Bridge]
Always stressing, sorry for the depression
Cause it’s not like I don’t ever count my blessings
But the music helps with venting
So I never have to mention
All these thoughts that are dark as my complexion
Second-guessing all of your intentions
Cause you mean well but you always gotta question
Everything that you do, don’t be a fool
Do what you love
And I hope that all this gets to…you

[Outro]
[Yawns] Damn
Ah, I'm tired
What time is it?
Oh, shit!
It's almost 4 in the morning!
I gotta stop recording so late, man
Damn!
I gotta hurry & get to sleep...
