[Intro: Denzel Curry]
Let's Go

[Sample]
Phantazm
The delusion of a disordered mind
A phantom
A spirit
A ghost
For ten years, the secret of Paragorge cemetery has remained
A mystery

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
One for the money and uh, two for the show
A couple of years ago my niggas were bumping to be low
Or too low key
Devil shit, get up on my level bitch
Say you 0500 but Im fucking over Triple 6
Crucifex, clan, aquarius killer at apprehending
Is with a tech nine, four five at my waist line
Ever since they took ? from my muthafuckin existence
It's been fuck a cop, fuck arrests and fuck a resistance
All black, rest in piss, kill these niggas like brotha lynch the
Porous or the dangerous, noose, rope, hang with it
Like, niggas please, niggas pleed, niggas bleed
What happens after the trigger squeeze?
She's on her knees
She ain't a queen, but I'm a king, jack
? here and we in that all black
Four Five to the six nigga that's head crack
I'm a killa bee, deadbeat like father dead track

[Outro/Hook: Denzel Curry & SpaceGhostPurrp]
Ghost, Spirit, Flash, I blaze 'em
Killa, killa, I'm phantazm
Killa, killa, I'm phantazm
Killa, killa, I'm phantazm
Ghost, Spirit, Flash, I blaze 'em
Killa, killa, I'm phantazm
Killa, killa, I'm phantazm
Killa, killa, I'm phantazm

[Sample]
It's only a dream
It's a dream
No It's Not
