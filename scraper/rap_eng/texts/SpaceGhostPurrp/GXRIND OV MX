[Intro]
Really, really, really, really

[Verse 1]
I got your mothafuckin' bitch all on my dick
SpaceGhostPurrp and I'm kissing on your chick
Bad-ass bitch and that pussy is so thick
Raider is the clan, yes she's fuckin with the click
Yes, I am the man and your bitch coming quick
But I don't trust her cause a bitch think they slick
Raiders in this bitch with the money, oh shit
Let me get you wet so you can grind on this dick, bitch

[Hook]
Grind on me, grind on me, grind on
Grind on me, grind on me, grind on
(I got your bitch on my dick, bitch)

[Verse 2]
I don't give a fuck bitch, I'm in the black room
Chilling with a betty who about to get loose
Nigga this the life, let me get the Grey Goose
Nigga fuck that, let me get the Black Goose
Bitch I got the Juice so I'm feeling like 'Pac
Black hoody on, drunk watching pussy pop
This the Raider lifestyle that I'll never quit
That's your main bitch, now she grinding on my dick, bitch

[Hook]
