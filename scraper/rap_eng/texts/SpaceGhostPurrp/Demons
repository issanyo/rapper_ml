Jolly Rancher Soda, Ridin' Round Like 'Hova. Corner Store In That Corolla, Turn Around Das Cola. (Repeat 4x)
I'm Leanin', Bitch I'm Leanin. Bitch I'm Leanin', Bitch I'm Leanin'. Gotta Stay Away, From These Demons. Bitch I'm Leanin', Bitch I'm Leanin'
Watch Yo iPhone, Cause I'm Schemin'. I Don't Hit Licks, But It's That Season. Smoked That Loud Pack, Now We Creepin'. I Can't Stand Straight, Completion. I'm With Bree-Lin, It's The Weekend. Niggas Seekin', I Just Defend; Ain't No Pretend, I Won't Weaken. For These Demons, For These Demons...
