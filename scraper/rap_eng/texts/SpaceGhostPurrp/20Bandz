[Intro: Lil Kujo]
Got the beam with the stock, 20 bands when I talk
Got the xans with the wok, body outlined in chalk

[Verse 1: Lil Kujo]
Catch the wave, catch the wave or you'll get left behind
High tide, long strides and my flow divine
Talk shit, get hit, meet the great divide
Real slick, big stick, and my bitches fine
Pull up with yo shawty, she a thotty, got a body
She ride like a Kawasaki, or a Harley, like it sloppy
And she feelin' on my body while I'm skrrtin' in a 'Rari
Catch you oppin', I'mma fade ya wack ass, get to floppin'
I'm the shit, bitch, yeah I'm makin' hits
And I pull up with my stick, muhhfucker let it hit
You ain't fuckin' with my gang, red dot on his head, now he Aang
With da bang bang bang, Kujo bringin' major pain
And that's factual, realest in the 502, actual
Catch me in the Acura, I'm speedin' past you after all
Pop another Adderall, feelin' like a demon
If you purposefully sleepin' you can swallow up my semen

[Hook: Lil Kujo & JASIAH]
Got the beam with the stock, 20 bands when I talk
Got the xans with the wok, body outlined in chalk
Got the beam with the stock, 20 bands when I talk
Got the xans with the wok, yuh, aye
Got the beam with the stock, 20 bands when I talk (ayo Phree, you wanna come out here?)
Got the xans with the wok, body outlined in chalk (yuh, ha, yuh)
Got the beam with the stock, 20 bands when I talk (ride)
Got the xans with the wok, body outlined in chalk, yuh

[Verse 2: JASIAH]
I be kamikaze, sloppy toppy from ya mommy
I might pull up with my goons, you act a fool you will get bodied
This a hobby, know I been cocky, why my wrist so sloppy
Drip is salty so damn often I need pussy, weed and money
All these niggas wack like where you at, tho? (fuck you at)
All these bitties bad like where they at, ho? (fuck they at)
Get up out my whip if you ain't past dough
I need so much cash, secure the bag bro, yuh-huh
Flexin' with my team, I need so much green
Walk around like Fauni, like why you testin' me
Fuck the rest in peace, they can't kill em, b
They way gettin' money, I got the recipe
I demand all the shit I be gettin', like understand, on a mission I'm (?)
I been the man, all you niggas are (?) shit, hit the fan, all you niggas are dippin'
I need revenge, all you niggas I'm killin', hit the dab when I feel like a villain
Fuck a band, I need me a 10 million, aye, fuck the man and the niggas that's with him
