[Verse 1]
Coming to the scene feeling very, very clean
New jeans you never seen, I found a Billie Jean
She was a fiend, for the fame and the fortune
Gave her a ring, till she claimed an abortion
Got rid of my seed, everything I need
Tell her she could be my queen if she swallow my babies
And keep it in her tummy, or I could leave you bummy
Baby girl you got a choice, ain't a damn thing funny
See I'm after this money while these honey's be dressing up
Come in the spot, now they lifting their breasts' up
You better be catching up, you niggas all in my dust
Can't fuck my connection up, your bitch be the one to lust
I be the one to bust, all over they faces
Counting my money up, I'm stacking Caucasian's
I am amazing, my nigga I'm racist
I hate fuck niggas, pee on niggas, they raisins
Bitch

[Hook x2]
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Don't rush it baby, don't rush it baby

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she think she the shit, when she walk she be moving her hips
In the motion of slow when she licking her lips
She a trip, I watch all the lame's with no game
Try to lay they mack down, it's whack, they all the same
I came, to step in the path and make her laugh
By the end of the night she made her own bath
Legs up, all in her gut
I know she feeling like the way she scream my name in vein she in the Phyllis
Killing the spot, nonstop
Every time they see our style we be making panties drop
Brand new cologne, turn into Love Jones
Moaning poetic thoughts, In the Vicky S. that a nigga bought
Yup, sipping Alize, your body hot
The way you move is smooth, it keep me motivated a lot
Ciroc, dripping down your breasts as your friends solace
With the ass, lick it all off her chest
I be like

[Hook]
