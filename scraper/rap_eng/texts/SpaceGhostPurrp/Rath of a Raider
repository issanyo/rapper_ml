[Intro]
You know the rebel
Black, shows the humblest in him
He don't have to say much
You know what I'm sayin? Cuz he a raider

[Verse 1]
Feel the wrath of a raider
He's a trendsetter and a skater
Constantly thinking about the fucking paper on a plane to Jamaica
She sucking on my balls at the dance hall
Fuck her FaceBook, then I'm skeeting in her damn wall
Halls
Me and your lanes are not compatible
You faggot niggas lame and square, quadrilateral
This avenue, is never, ever safe to ever travel through
Holotips blow your head back, that's a lateral
After you, talk shit my raider niggas capture you
Lyrically works out, the metaphor will tackle you
Pop out the strap, while the punchlines frackle you
Showing them wack rappers, like yeah that's what I have to do
Smackle you
Niggas in the base with my rhyme books
Teach these pussy niggas how to rap, now its time
Look, I leave your mind shook
Cause your bitch got to crush your castles
They call me the pussy
Raider

[Hook]
So feel the wrath of a raider 4x

[Verse 2]
Now all the pretty girls wanna date him
And all the jealous niggas wanna hate him
The people try to fake him
But he's too smart
With a cold heart, there's gonna be crime
Bitch, I laugh like Kevin Hart
From the start, a nigga gave a fuck
But I see that love was a waste of time, so I gave it up
A soulless world, God shake it up
Never heard of Muney Jordan is your homework
Make it up
Break it up if he ain't fucking you right
Take your ass on a van
You'll have a good night
Good right?
And yeah, Purrp would feel a lot better
Told me that ten hours later, cuz I got the pussy wetter
Leather jacket, all black
With the raider snapback
With the tims to the match
Its all love, black
The only crew to walk around like the Terminator
Get outta line you little bitch, and feel the wrath of a real raider

[Hook]
