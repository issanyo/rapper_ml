[Intro - Half Metal Kaiba]
Hol up
Mirror crackin at the rendezvous
Snow, I’m seein double, huh, what, call it deja vu
Under skin, I’m scheming, see Cthulu when I’m dreaming
He said...

[Siren's Anthems Interlude]
What are you listening to?
Nothing, the anthems
What anthems?

[Verse 1 - Half Metal Kaiba]
Ima slay him, what the fuck you sayin?
Clip his wings and flay him
Young Godzilla and I’m burning skrilla
R.I.P. to Dilla, go
Burning rubber, Final Fight, I’m stuck in City Metro
Got a, what, got a demon, so I’m boxing with my shadow, aye
Gamblin with my mental, go
King like I’m the Running Man
You dancing with the devil, aye
Smokin on the metal pack
I’m pushing down the pedal, go
Pocket full of rubber bands
My paper confidential, aye
VHS, no rental, go
Crack the mirror quick, ‘cause I ain’t fuck with my reflection, huh, what
On the block like buster, please stay out my section, huh, what
Lookin like Yakuza, Kaiba young Korean, huh, what
Buster Blader, aye, move like Space Invader, aye, yuh
And I fear the ‘pocalypse, doom, in the Oculus
I can’t feel my face, I’m skiing off some ocky, aye
I can’t feel my face, I’m really off that rocky, aye
And I can’t trust you if you not gon bleed for me, aye

[Chorus - Half Metal Kaiba/BRUHMANEGOD]
Keychain Kai, the horseman, I got doomsday on my back
We are the problem that will always be ‘round, you better quiet down
Shattered glass and micrograms, I’m swervin outta wack
Crashed a Prius and I’m coming right back, fuck xans, fuck that
Ugly off that anti, drug inflicted, zooted out
Goddamn, you in Hell right now
Swear I never seen you, keep that metal in my mouth
Got titanium fangs for your fade

[Verse 2 - BRUHMANEGOD]
Pick a dead skunk up off the side of the road
Ima munch it up and vibe, capture essence, that’s the code
Word to V and Ego, throw me all the cheat codes
Rappers lookin up to rapists, so it’s fuck VLONE
You ain’t shit, you can’t hide
I been feelin like Hyde
Everything you know is a lie
Everything you know is a lie
In my hands, what’s that, that’s ya baaaags
I’m the baron, this is my soundtraaaack
These Novato kids smoke mid paaaack
Me and HMK blow big gas
All you motherfuckin rappers are some ass
Soundcloud totin, what the fuck is that
Ima have to show you kiddies where it’s at
BRUHMANEGOD is the king of the rats

[Chorus - Half Metal Kaiba/BRUHMANEGOD]
Keychain Kai, the horseman, I got doomsday on my back
We are the problem that will always be ‘round, you better quiet down
Shattered glass and micrograms, I’m swervin outta wack
Crashed a Prius and I’m coming right back, fuck xans, fuck that
Ugly off that anti, drug inflicted, zooted out
Goddamn, you in Hell right now
Swear I never seen you, keep that metal in my mouth
Got titanium fangs for your fade
