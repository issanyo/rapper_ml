[Verse]

I close my eyes
Wishing I can fuckin' make it
I'm tired of being broke, God, I can't fucking take it
I dream about all the shit that I want to do
Ride with a bad bitch, Sippin' [?] fruit juice
Spaceghostpurrp, I'mma bring this rap shit back
Thank the Bricksquad, them niggas brought the trap shit back
My flow is like a train, the way I ride on a track
Never will I trust a bitch, they might stab you in the back
I'mma' change the rap game, can't sell my soul for [?]
