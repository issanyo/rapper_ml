[Intro]

[Verse]
Bass boomin' to the mothafuckin max
GPS a pussy
Riding deep, where they at?
I smoke real good but I don't smoke wax
[If] your bitch fuck good, then I might call back

Pussy nigga know, who the hell you playing with
Gon buy the rose, yeah she a bad bitch
Sew a nigga up like a piece of fabric
Then it probably won't make it then that shit tragic

Six feet nigga, put him in a basket
Young Kenshin Travis steady doing damage
Only fuck niggas won't understand me
I'm an astronaut, underwater Sandy
Took your bitch with a piece if candy
Shout out to the niggas up in Miami

Chicks and money on the fucking granite
I'ma beat his ass, I'm a straight bandit
Fuck a nigga mean, let him straight have it
Choppers on the scene, Afghanistan shit
Memphis young nigga put them in a bracket
Probably get rich, [and] fuck a bad actress

Shawty what's your name, I was just asking
I was in the bank, I was just cashing
Seen her from a far, she was straight dashing
But back to the raps, I was just ashin'
Nigga too high, I be straight bragging
Spit hot fire like a red dragon
Talk that shit, better get a casket
Try to harm me, have your soul dancing
Try to harm me, have your soul dancing, I was outstanding
Bitch I'm VIP, your was on the out standing
Don't look at me to let you in the building
Chris fucking Travis, yeah I know they feel him
And when I'm not there, pussy know I'm still here
And when I'm not close, pussy know I'm still here
When I unload, pussy know I kill shit

See you niggas whack, I can't even feel it
Tats on my throat, I ain't even feel shit
And if you got a bone, lets make a killing
Lets make a toast to the niggas not shit
Send me a beat, I'ma make it a hit
Send me some weed, I'ma make it a lick
I'm a weed smoker so I need an extra six
You can't spark shit
Boy you need an extra kick

Shout out to my nigga
Purp merked on the beat
Beat a nigga ass, leave him merked in the street
At a stop sign where the cross roads meet
Bitch i'm bout mines, it's never about we
I don't do crime, leave it for the young G's
I'm a young nigga but I feel OG
Backwood lit full of Bubba OG
Nigga look away cause you don't know me
I'm a suspect, that you probably owe me
Niggas need to know that there's only one me
You can imitate but can never intervene
Kenshin at the top
And you just in-between


[Outro]
Bitch
