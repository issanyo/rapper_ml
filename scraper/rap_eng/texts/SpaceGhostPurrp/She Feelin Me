Shawty is the one cuz she feeling what I'm feeling

[Verse 1]
Going hard everyday, you know how she like it
Shawty is a freak, but she know how to hide it
Loyal ass shawty, damn girl you a real one
Get my Glock 40, cuz you know a nigga love guns
Shoot it in the air, nigga I don't care
If you see 12, hide the drugs in your hair
"Where did Purrp go"?

Niggas say I fell off, cuz I'm falling in this hoe
Bitch, I guess you mad
Cuz a nigga like me putting on

Brand new golds, everything I like

All them fake niggas, I'mma stunt on you
