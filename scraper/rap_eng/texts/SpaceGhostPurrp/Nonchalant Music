Cut the pussy nigga off, got him looking stupid
Getting money on these pussy niggas, man, I'm foolish
Shitting on my old bitch, man, how you do this?
Man, it's Purple Haze, man, I get so foolish
Shout out big homie Shawty Lo, he got me feeling foolish
Shitting on these fake niggas, that is how I do it
Man, I run the whole city, man, you ain't stupid
If you disrespect my niggas, man, they get to shooting
These niggas jealous of me, these niggas plotting on me
These niggas scared as fuck, you is not my homie
These niggas hella scary, these niggas got no self-esteem
And these niggas mad I got high self-esteem
Man, I be swagging on yo whole damn team
Man, I do not sell my bitch no dream

Real niggas do real things, stay thugging
Niggas don't [?], some real niggas go [?]
Real niggas don't pussy out when it's time to do
Real niggas don't pussy out when it's time to do something real
If you ain't 'bout that life, pussy nigga, take out yo grill
'Cause if you ain't, I'ma take yo grill and break it down

Of money or something, a hunnid or something
Getting to this money, bitch, you know I love stunting
