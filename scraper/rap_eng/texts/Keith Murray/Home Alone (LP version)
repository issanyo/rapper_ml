It's gonna be a party y'all
Keith Murray roacks wide and universal and most come
Combine with R. Kelly and prove it can be done
Non stoppin' Def Squad and Rockland
I here somebody knockin', yo R the party's startin'

Step into the crib with me tonight[what's up baby]
Kelly's in the mood to make it right
Word is gettin' all over town
The party's over here and gettin' down oh yeah

Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills
Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around
Me and the crew, doin' what we do

Beat is bangin' up and down your spine
And all the single women here are fine
[it's a beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing]
Let your body give into your soul
Release the freak and you will lose control

Girl there's a party goin' on, my temperature's warm
So let me freak you to the floor, while the bass is thumpin'
All night if your body can handle it

Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills
Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around
Me and the crew, doin' what we do

Chillin' at the house on the hill
We gotta sing my my my like Johnny Gill
Rich girl, poor girl get the same respect
You can all drink for free and call Earl collect
At the moment of truth with burden of proof
We stacks the stuff and spread love like it's used
The lyrical genius and R&B messiah
And the roof, the roof, we sets on fire
But as long as the party is jumping, we ain't concerned
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
And everybody knew somebody who was there
With they hands in the air bringing in the new year, yeah ay yo, come on

Nuggets on the wrist, it's just the shine
'Cause ain't nobody checkin' out the time
Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind
Maybe it's all good so there's tonight

All we want is a party a reason to celebrate
Now that we got the money we dance the night away
Nothing but the hands up

Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills
Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around
Me and the crew, doin' what we do

Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills
Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around
Me and the crew, doin' what we do

Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills
Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around
Me and the crew, doin' what we do

Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills
Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around
Me and the crew, doin' what we do

Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills
Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around
Me and the crew, doin' what we do

Hands in the air[get 'em up y'all], drinks everywhere, party in the hills
Keepin' it real, guests from out of town, ladies all around
Me and the crew, doin' what we do
