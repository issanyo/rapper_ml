Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morninh
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

[Keith Murray]
Yo the streets is hungry - word
Its time to eat, most definitely
Grab ya plate
Get your knifes and your forks yea
Keith Murray Get ready

Yo, as I look out at the high rise
And write about my life into the sunrise
Looking at the smoke where the twin towers stood
Forty blocks away forty stories high I could see it good but we
Been at war and under attack
We got P.O.W.s fighting to get back in jail
And these affected by the poverty war
We pack gats frontline and will endure
I go to, bed with god and wake up with the devil
In a battle I blacked out and beat a man with a shovel
Its obligatory that you hear my side of the story
He had the face a fear, shaking like a leaf on a tree
You just another potential casualty
This is a walking corpse song and the beat is your conspiracy theory
And the time is getting more scary
So pack when necessary and say your L.O.D Hail Marys

[Joe Hooker]
Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

[Keith Murray]
Yo I'm eye of a tiger inside the head of a liar
Give 'em pure hell brimstone and fire
This is MC cannibalism by connoisseur
From the lyrical lexicon matador of metaphor
Yo from the little voice in my conscience
I might just leave your fucking ass unconscious
Yeah I seen you with that smirk on
You little fucking clown I turn that smile into an upside down frown
Produce chaos in the culture of the enemy
You will never posses the skills to defeat me
I be the all eye seeing, you hear it sporadic
I rhyme at will be on your ass automatic
With thoughts of power I rain thunder showers
I eat a lot of brain food and you'll get devoured
Man hunt chase of the night stalker off da leash walker
My dog is a fire barker

[Joe Hooker]
Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

[Keith Murray]
Yo from the instinctual coming of the insect
To the mind of a genius and the heart of a prophet
To them bootlegged niggas and the chicks that cop it
Ask anyone they know how the fuck drop it
And coasting constant motion essential
With fusion nuclear potential
You hear a cold whisper you see the mask of a phantom acts wailing, deranged assailant
I tame the rage, isolate, chase and kill my prey
Walk the lion out of the cage
And that's a part of life or should I say death
Reach in your mouth snatch out your very last breath
Searching my subconscious for the meaning
I'm sweating blood bullets cause my whole world is bleeding
Oh now check how I come at you
I will eat you, defeat you, I'm parasitical

[Joe Hooker]
Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

[Keith Murray]
There's no where you can run
No way to hide
The world is a cage and we all locked inside
So you might as well fight to survive
Yeah, yeah
