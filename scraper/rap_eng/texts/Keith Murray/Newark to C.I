[Shaq]
Before anyone gets upset
We're only sayin funkin'
F-u-n, k-i-n
Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
That's right boy
George The King Village
Watch this seven-footer spit rhymes like a loogie
Funked up like some doogie warrior, just like sazuki
Ah, Twism, man of steel organism
Combined with phat rhymes comin' from my wall prism
In my league hoopers don't act their age
You might be another dead boy front page
I make more cash than the president
Find a bigger residence
Shaq is the man and that's evident
Irelevent, what them critics say
Until they come rhyme, come act, come play
Get out me way
Or come trip into this rhyme funk
I'm nut-rageous, outrageous, like the Buddha monk
It's about where you're from not where you went
Newark, New Jersey, represent, represent
To the fullest, you messin' round, you's a dead man
Prepare for the Redman

[Keith Murray]
Oh yo yo yo, hold up
Due to certain circumstances, Redman will not be performing tonight
But we got Keith Murray from the Def Squad up in here
So, you know what I'm sayin', check it out
Never question who I am, black
I slam jams with Redman, Erick Sermon, and the Shaq
I wreck this with wreckless emotionless
Above any beyond the depths of physics
With bio feed back techniques
I speak over the beat
So peep a true thug from the streets
Of New York
Where you get outlined in chalk
And the herbest person gets foul like pork
You walk and talk into tripizoid
Boy I can flipizoid, trapizoid on record
All these MCs out here is a big dissapointment
So I refuse to lose and ooze like ointment
Into a deconcentration
I scrape you and your scab-ass crew up like vaxitration
And if you're 6-9, 280, tryin' to get ill
I'll have my man Shaquille O'Neal push your grill
And that's real

[Shaq]
Some choose to pack a MAC, I choose to pack my Shaq
Twenty twos
I wonder how you'd act if you was in my shoes
This is how I take the old from the new
All my nines down the line kick and lead it too
Rugged never smooth with this move as I flow
On and on this track, my papes stacked in the back
Step up to get funk in your face
'88 was Runs house, but '95 is Shaqs place
Cracked up like Boogie, from New Jack City
High with the clowns, but down with the nitty gritty
Fool, child, with the high profile
Style kind of hoop-hoppa-listic wild
Come, get some
From the one that freaks the fees, the foes, the fies, the fums
I flip my style like a pancake flipper
Dive-dive dipper
Let me pull up my zipper
I'm sick and tired of pissin' on this track
Newark represnts lovely
Redman and the Shaq
For the '96, '97
Jersey is representin'
Always and fo'ever
Fo'ever and always
Prince Street, where ya at
George The King Village, where ya at
Naughtyville, where ya at
Can't forget the brothers in Chilltown, J.C
Oakstreet representin'
Ha ha, and I'm out
