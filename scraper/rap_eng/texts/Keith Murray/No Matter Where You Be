No matter where you be
The Streets gonna test
Slugs in your chest
No matter where you rest
Better step back
Cause we be the best, yeah

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Yo, niggas talking reckless cause they think they could
Meanwhile, killers is lurking in your hood
Niggas go to jail, and be dying left to right
Meanwhile, yall promoting bullshit on the mic
The wages are war, your cross means death
And we gon’ keep banging, till none of us left
I’ve done grew up with some too many real niggas that passed
And let you cross my path, and knife get up in yo ass
I see my first body ? future
Where I first bare to witness what the gats do to ya
Niggas yelling static, getting outta place
Meanwhile, Doolam with a hole in his face
You can’t live forever, sometimes you gotta go
But Where? When? And How? Only we know
He just got about the system, when ?
Now ? I was just with em’
(You fucking with the best, boy)

[Hook: Jaz]
No matter where you be
The Streets gonna test
Slugs in your chest
No matter where you rest
Better step back
Cause we be the best, yeah

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
My pops passed in ’85 and my moms ‘91
Ever since then, I’ve been in the streets on the run
You come into this world alone and you leave alone
But somebody coming with me, cause I keep the chrome
I roll with Def Squad and Legion of Doom
But you can feel the devil, when he’s inside the room
Its like only happens to real terror ones
Meanwhile, you cowords still alive and you having your fun
They say, karma is when you get exact energy back
A lotta good dudes pass, where the karma in that
And faggots is looking for some type of directions
Meanwhile, my squad is taking the section
25-to-life or few to the head
Anyway you look at it, both these niggas dead
My all day, forte is plotting to scheme it
Even when I’m dreaming, I be chasing demons
(You fucking with the best, boy)

[Hook: Jaz]
No matter where you be
The Streets gonna test
Slugs in your chest
No matter where you rest
Better step back
Cause we be the best, yeah
(Happen Just That Fast)

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
I trying to cherish these small things I get in life
Cause' you can wake up in the morning and be dead daylight
Man, drink to my memories, fuck the sorrow
Cause you too, can be in today and gone tomorrow
Me and 50 Grand was walking by Quad studios, where Pac' got hit up
But that ain't when he died though
Since the lil nigga, running from the scene outta breath
Always seem to come up close brush with death
No stranger, I lost like 10 over the years
And thats not count of like 50 of my peers
So you can try to deceive the masses with lies
But telling the truth nigga, do you wanna die?
(You fucking with the best, boy)

[Hook: Jaz]
No matter where you be
The Streets gonna test
Slugs in your chest
No matter where you rest
Better step back
Cause we be the best, yeah
