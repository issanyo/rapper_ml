[Intro]
Hip hop to the fullest, hip hop to the fullest
Hip hop to the fullest

[Keith Murray sample]
The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
The most beautifullest thing in this world is
The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
The most beautifullest thing in this world is

[Verse 1]
They call me Frederico capi, flowing is my hobby
Still move low, they think I'm still up in the lobby
I had to leave that edition, Bobby
I murder ink, I never let y'all rule, Gotti
I'm at the Knick game, stop it
Jeremy Lynn, the china soft I'ma Rocket
I'm in the Bronx like Robinson Canoe
Kill you spur of the moment, David Robinson can know
And they know I get Benjamins more
Candy paint by Benjamin Moore
Now my sugar high flow, why wouldn't I
We can bring the llamas boy
All I do is draw guns, we call that art of war
Now homie, what you doing
Gat spit, tall as Patrick, look what you in, huh
I'm used to this thing, and I get busy for real
It's a beautiful thing, Fred!

[Chorus: sample]
The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
The most beautifullest thing in this world is
(When you rapping hip hop to the fullest
And your lyrics is a weapon
And they love it when you pull it, Fred)

The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
The most beautifullest thing in this world is
(When you rapping hip hop to the fullest
And your lyrics is a weapon
And they love it when you pull it, Fred)

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my bar, God spitting the word
Rookie of the year, Robert Griffin the 3rd
Once you say action, I'm in the play action
Or I could throw you these bullets or we can stay rapping
I see why girls find the attraction
Calling me T.I., we on a Mac Tiny chatting
You don't mind me asking
Who do you listen the most to?
Are you a fan or is it someone that you close to?
But whatever, I'ma score or he'll forfeit
Soddom and Gomorrah, I'm insulted
Metaphors awkward, flow in sync, I never force it
Get it, flow in sink, I never faucet, haha
Nobody rap hard as me
You ain't gotta know about cars
To acknowledge me, haha
I'm used to this thing, see I get busy for real
It's a beautiful thing, Fred!

[Chorus: sample]
The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
The most beautifullest thing in this world is
(When you rapping hip hop to the fullest
And your lyrics is a weapon
And they love it when you pull it, Fred)

The most beautifullest, the most beautifullest
The most beautifullest thing in this world is
(When you rapping hip hop to the fullest
And your lyrics is a weapon
And they love it when you pull it, Fred)
