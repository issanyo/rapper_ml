[Chorus Keith Murray & Canibus]
I know you blakout, I blakout too
This the burnout, so I'ma burn out wit' you
You blakout? Yeah, I blakout too
This the burnout, so I'ma burn out wit' you

[Keith Murray]
It's like anxiety got the best of me
But you wouldn't understand cos you just a clone of society
That penitentiary wil make you go crazy
For a buck niggas gotta rob and steel
Who gives a fuck about a Lindsey Lohan

[Chorus: Keith Murray]
I know you blakout, I blakout too
This the burnout, so I'ma burn out wit' you
You blakout? Yeah, I blakout too
This the burnout, so I'ma burn out wit' you
X2

[Canibus]
You say I lost my style, I thought I found out how
In both cases its a classic side-effect of denial
You should bounce, before a nigga start twistin' his mouth
Basic instructions after tryna' call him out
I don't think he goin' for it, look how badly he want it
It's not impressive if its a short performance
Its too long it gets boring
Can't do nothing for you regardless
It's hard to get collaborations with the artists
Everybody all talkin' at once, I spark the blunt
They say, "Canibus you wanna' put your rhyme in the front?"
My mind is not even there, I spit ten thousand bars this year
I still got the ten thousand yard stare

[Chorus -Canibus with variations-]
You blakout? No doubt, I blakout too
Undergods back out, you should come back out too
Yo you blakout?

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
This the day the Earth stood still
Niggas say Canibus he still nice
Nigga what the fuck you mean
I was a fiend since Rakim was 19
