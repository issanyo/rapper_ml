Yo', this is funky
Stevie J (Yeah) this is funky (Word)
Cherrelle, come on

Keith kicks the rhyme at the right time
In a black jeep with Cherrelle in the driver's seat
Socializin', dip-dip divin'
Noddin' to a phat Stevie J beat
Master of disaster, you came to me
We treat the Benz just like a hooptie
We bring noise and the funk with the chalk and the skunk
With the double pump in the trunk
Learn a lesson, we make it hot
I'm not a player hater, yo', I just dis a lot
Cherrelle

What am I to say what I gotta do
To let you know my heart is calling out for you
Gotta find the right time
Can't deny that I need you in my life

Been knowing you for awhile now
Always said I had to have you somehow
I'm just a woman who knows what she needs
If you're down, come take a chance with me, ho, ho...

What am I to say (Say) what I gotta do (Do)
To let you know my heart is calling out for you (Oh)
Gotta find (Gotta find ) the right time (Right time)
Can't deny that I need you in my life

I want a man just to love me
I take care of myself, I don't need to help
Don't wait for my to get down on my knees
I won't beg, don't plead, just tell me where to start, I need

I know that you're afraid of getting caught up in romance
But my love is calling, give me a chance (Give me a chance)
You're all I really love
And I'm yearning for your love

What am I to say (Mmm) what I gotta do
To let you know my heart is calling out for you
Gotta find (Gotta find ) the right time (Right time)
Can't deny that I need you in my life (What I got to say)

What am I to say (What I gotta do) what I gotta do

But my love is calling, give me a chance (Won't you give me a chance)
You're all I really love
[Yo', yo, Keith Murray]
And I'm yearning for your love

This is the tight situation, I might cause trouble
I called up Stevie J, three way D double
You know the click that stay on the bubble
Who bed-rockin' these h@#$ to sleep like Barney Rubble
Anyway like I was about to say
I ran into this pretty lil' some'in' yesterday
???And you Keith jimmy walk a style down I might???
I said, "Excuse me, I'm not married but you look like my wife"
She looked one skinny props, said, "Thanks"
I said "Don't thank me, thank your mom and pops, h@#" (Tell me why)

What am I to say (What I to say) what I gotta do (What am I to do)
To let you know my heart is calling out for you
Gotta find (Gotta find ) the right time (Right time)
Can't deny that I need you in my life (I need you, oh, yeah)

Boy, I wanna fight it [Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah]
I can't deny it [You can't]
So I won't fight it [Don't fight it, baby]
No, no [You know]

Gotta find (No, no) the right time (No, no, no)
Can't deny that I need you in my life (No, no, no) [No doubt]
[At the right time, it's gotta be the right time]
[If it ain't the right time, then it ain't my time]
[And I'm gone]

Give me all the love I need [Keith Murray]

Never have the love I want
Give me all the love I need
