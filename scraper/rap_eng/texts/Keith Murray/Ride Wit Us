[Keith Murray]
Yeah, ride with me, yeah!
Yeah! Ride with me
Roll ya down windows and ride with me
(All: Ride with us) Yeah!
Bitch (All: Ride with us) Yeah!
(All: Ride With us)
Roll up ya windows and (All: Ride with us)

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
Let's smoke this Oakland Indo don't roll down the window
Start the car we ain't going to far
You know that big booty girl you're always fucking wit?
She got a sister, I really want to get
Some Georgia girls, some College Park
You already fucked when we get to start it off
Park in a drive-way, it won't take long
Do it like that it goes, on and on
You know this the kind of the shit I know you want
E made the beat, let me show you something (Erick Sermon: Yeah)
Quite a few hate us, wanna see us play out
But we got the formula to get paid now (Erick Sermon: Word up)
You can't stand in the way of success
We got the same job but you make much less
I remember how it used to be (Erick Sermon: Like what?) before we had crack
If you had a few hundreds in your pocket that was fat

[Erick Sermon-Chorus]
If you feel like smoking then (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
Hop the train with no token (Bitch) (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
If ya don't give a fuck then (All: Ride with us)

[Keith Murray]
Roll ya windows down and (All: Ride with us)

[Erick Sermon]
If ya got +5 On It+ then (All: Ride With us) (Redman: Yeah!)
And if ya hate fake niggas then (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
And if ya cool pull triggers then (All: Ride with us)

[Redman]
Roll up ya windows and (All: Ride with us)

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
Aiyyo, I lick two shots it's heard around the world
Check out our forty and a blunt can take a nigga girl (Take a nigga girl)
Like E ? don't say nothing I'm hunting (Redman: Word)
On the microphone, it's the eve of destruction (Redman: Yeah!)
As the world goes around like passion you get flat in a orderly fashion
You was warn like a coming detraction
I got playa hated, felt liberated
Put em on a burner cause nigga violated (Redman: Word! Word!)
We scamper like guide dogs through the fog
If ya feel like you wanna hop, leap like a frog (Like a frog!)
Like a Sergent General, get busy chief (Redman: Word up)
The fastast way to spell wrong relief is Keith! (Redman: Keith!)
I leave you ass'd out like a cocain droute
Aiyo, can I get a witness like Andre Crotch? (Redman: Crotch!)
Niggas need to stop frontin, bitches need to stop stuntin (Redman: Word!)
Cause they know fuck well they can't stop my production

[Erick Sermon-Chorus]
If ya like smoking then (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
Hop the train with no token (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
If ya don't give a fuck then (All: Ride with us)

[Redman]
Roll ya windows down and (Too $hort: Beotch!) (All: Ride with us)

[Erick Sermon]
And If ya got +5 On It+ then (All: Ride With us)
And if ya hate fake niggas then (All: Ride with us)
And if ya cool pull triggers then (All: Ride with us)

[Redman]
Roll up ya windows and (All: Ride with us)

[Verse 3: Redman]
Aiyyo, I got the, forty acres without the fucking mule
Doc Ike Turner, giving mic's audio abuse (Erick Sermon: Word up)
I smack a big mouth bitch, and her baby sitter and her lesbian friend, and
That nigga with her
I don't give a fuck I smack blood outta midget
My tactics make Evil D say "Come on, kick it!"
A black five with rims which could spot me in
When I die, I snatch you like Doc  Kervorkian
So turn the beat up while Narcs got me on sweep up (Uh-huh)
I'm lucky, I usually tote more guns than Peter (Ha-ha)
I'll fuck you up till where you forehead and cut meat up
You wanna box I +Square+ more than Madison Arena (Ding!)
Backstabbing bitches and niggas, EAT A DICK!
Plus, you never heard the Doc do nothing like this
Backstabbing bitches and niggas, EAT A DICK!
Plus, you never heard the Doc do nothing like this

[Erick Sermon-Chorus]
If ya like smoking then (All: Ride with us)
Hop the train with no token (Bitch) (All: Ride with us) (All: Yeah!)
If ya don't give a fuck then (All: Ride with us)

[All]
Roll ya windows down and ride with us

[Erick Sermon]
And If ya got +5 On It+ then (All: Ride With us) (Redman: Yeah!)
And if ya hate fake niggas then (All: Ride with us) (Redman: Yeah!)
