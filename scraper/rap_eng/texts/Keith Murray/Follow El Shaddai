[Verse 1: Canibus]
Kool Herc was the first Hip Hop god on Earth
His offspring was cursed, we was treated the worst
The Undergods known to catch metaphorical wreck
The names of the gods recorded in historical texts
The ancient gods or the present gods
Every civilization commemorate God, what does it mean to say God?
The creator of all, the rock of my Gibraltar
Bring your lyrics to the alter, the druids offered us holy fluid water
The Inuit indians, take us through the passage to Agartha
We engage in battle with Satan's monsters
Our fire bow arches have no affect on the heartless
Counter their strategy, fall back for reinforcements
We both agree our weapons of metal will not be sufficient for offence
We need spiritual warriors
So who do be absolve then, who is the redeemer of all men
These physical walls will exhaust him
We fight Shambhala sorcerers with Canaanite consciousness
The masters of metallurgy and metamorphosis
To be but not to be seen, they remain anonymous
Army of a thousand legs defeated the serpent with a hundred heads
After the serpent laid another hundred eggs
The gift of reproduction gave him the edge
In other words through genetic cloning nothing is dead
Yeah, my face tattoo make me look like a space raccoon
Or a giant moon based baboon
I got a viper kick, made out of viper spit
Midaz touch tiger grip, pirates in a gun fighter ship
Keep running your mouth nigga, I'ma strike you in the lip
With an icepick, then throw you off an icicle cliff
The words of the Undergod El Gabor, come sit with me y'all
Let's talk through the iPad ouija board
Lyrically Noir, you ain't fucking with the Undergods
'In Gods We Trust', crush ya synagogues to dust

[Chorus: Canibus]
This the Undergod's El Gabor bars, comes sit with us Lord
Let's talk through the iPad Ouija board
Lyrically Noirnorst, Crush Microphones to Dust
This the Undergod's El Gabor bars, comes sit with us Lord
Let's talk through the iPad Ouija board
Lyrically nor, you ain't fucking with the Undergods
In Gods We Trust, Crush Microphones to Dust
