Intro:
Niggas can't hold me back
We ain't comin' for no bullshit
Niggas talking all that yackedy yack word up

Verse 1:
Here's to Mrl Keith Murray
The Mr. Pictionary
The Mr. quicck to fuck shit up in a hurry
ON the mic I'll squash you little Ms. Philosoophy
With atomic technological atrocity
I find it very ironic that niggas try to rhyme behind me
The supersonic Def Squad MC
Get bird's eye view
And don't miss the crispiest nigga in the nucleus
With futuristic linguistics
Ballistics be twisted like physics (word up)
Niggas be like how you come up wit this shit
But it's automatic, I'm inorganic
With the ability to travel nine planets
Niggas can't undrstand it, please
I spark the brain of your G's
We could battle for car keys and car titles
House deeds and bank accounts to make it final
I got what you need
The most homicidal words to co9me out of a human being
Mind state sick like Idi Amin

Hook:
You can do what ya got to
And say what you may
But niggas gonna come outside wit gun play anyway
So I play the game
And let the ball bounce where it may
And roll with Def Squad and L.O.D. everday X2

Verse 2:
Abracadabra talk shit I'll reach right out and grad ya
The hype got you like gimmy
Don't let it have ya
I'll knowck you skeezas pleasers black like Jesus
Never lost in the jungle
Navigators with caesars
Instead dare iz a dark side said by Red
I'm consciously, crusciously coming for your head
I'm from a small coast call stay out my path
And from a big city called foot up in your ass
Jeepers, weepers, peepers get snuffed
By the sneakiest, throughout the speakers
Like fist to cuffs
Who the fuck is this paging me?
Oh, it's my creepy, greepy, grimy
Rough rhyme, crimy Reggie, I'm saying
Fuckwho, went where, when, why and how
Get my shit to me not now but right now
Lucky niggas went platinum
Thinkin' they can see us
We swoop down on crews
Like angels on dust
I'll leave you mental so broke
You can't pay attention
When I get inside your head
And take your brain to another dimension
I'm itching for a scratch
And somebody to try to match
The battle cat constatly be on it like that
The doom has dawned in
We knockin' niggas out without warning
And pissing on them
The configuration is brain cell wastin'
Renegades of funk
Like Africa Bambatta and the Zulu Nation
You facin' a maniac
Pacing over the track
Constantly bringing drama like Jason
In fact I'm L.O.D.ing it and there go planet Def Squad
Puttin' it down play for play like Ahmad Rashad
For the cause, I"m wiring jaws
Got niggas eating full-course meals out of crazy straws
And if it win't def it ain't shit
I'm taking it to the limit
And killing it each and every minute
Cause Keith Murray takes the beef a major step higher
And peace makers will get causght in the cross fire
Hip Hop's filled with back stabbers
Blunt grabbers, cats with dirty claws, dogs with filthy paws
Then you got rap artists
Claimin' to be the hardest
Bust them in their shit
And they're quick to press charges
Spot rushers, block busters, rockin' diamond clusters
Comin' to stick the rich out you motherfuckers
Educated black man on premises
L.O.D. and Def Squad forever Arch nemesis
