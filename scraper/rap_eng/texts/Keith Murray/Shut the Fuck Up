Is it on?
Faggot ass niggas, talkin all that bullshit
Worried about what I do but I don't give a fuck
You know what I'm sayin, cuz if I listen to that shit...

[Verse 1]
I be the metaphorical Don Juan's upon
My confidant bring my words to life, make shit bond
See the lyrical lexicon makes strong songs DJ's gotta throw on
Thug niggas love to bug along
And wack MC's dream on and on
Drifting further from reality, concentratin on me flow on
I master murderous phrases simile, homicidal delivery
And don't give a fuck who don't like me
See we be, the type of MC's bringing equilibrium into the industry
Your own peeps say you pussy
I show up unexpectedly to the release party
Get up close and personally snatch your body
Often say, place your life status see on crtically
But y'all just sound like you dissin me subliminally
See you walkin contradiction, caught up in the friction
If you can't stand the heat, stay the fuck out the kitchen
In front of the whole industry on national TV
I'll bluntly, tell you to shut the fuck up

HOOK:
To all you got the pen niggas
Shut the fuck up
All you stinky, dirty tramps
Shut the fuck up
All the hoes on his dick
Shut the fuck up
All you lyin motherfuckers
Shut the fuck up

[Verse 2]
You'd be surprised what niggas go through to dis the squad
Call our business lines tryin na sound all fuckin hard
When your man dialed the number, heard my voice, jumped on my dick
Then you grabbed the phone and started poppin mega shit
Then tried to kick a little bullshit rhyme or two
About how much money you can make and how much damage you can do
But the simple fact is that you wanna be me
Redman, Erick Sermon, and the L.O.D
But the next time you wanna be me look in the mirror
The next time you leave a voice mail speak clearer
Fun loving criminal, savage mic killer
Comes through by way of knockout on the strength of my niggas
Ther arsenal successor, mister apply the pressure
On niggas frontin like the Nutty Professor
I pull you foul, track you down like a private detective
Then put you in your proper perspective
And tell you shut the fuck up

HOOK
To all you shitty drawls cats
Shut the fuck up
All you fake thug niggas
Shut the fuck up
All you gay ass niggas
Shut the fuck up
All you media freaks
Shut the fuck up
All you hype motherfuckers
Shut the fuck up
All you fake drug dealers
Shut the fuck up

You better shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
You better shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up
