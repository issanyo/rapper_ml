I point my headlights at you
I point my headlights at you

Now what'cha getting into
Before you get in too far
'Cause whatever you do
And whatever you are
I want my headlights on you

I point my headlights at you
I point my headlights at you

Now what'cha getting into
Before you get in too far
'Cause whatever you do
And whatever you are
I want my headlights on you

I don't mind the dark 'cause I want you to be
The only thing I see
And I want your headlights... on me

Now what'cha getting into
Before you get in too far
'Cause whatever you do
And whoever you are
I want my headlights on you
I want my headlights on you
