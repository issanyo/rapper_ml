Intro: Redman

Huahhhhh!
Ha ha, ayyaah, owww owww
Funked out, word is bond, word is bond
Then you ayyyayyyah ha
In the mother, in the motherfuckin house
With a dick in your mouth
Word is bond, word is bond

Verse One: Erick Sermon
I freak a technique Goin Way Back like Just-Ice
And don't think twice because I'm nice
I come from the Mothership unknown to man
With a blunt in my hand, a mic in the other hand
God damn I slam I jam like this
Sure nuff, my rap style is Cold Crush
And plus, I tears the roof off the mothersucker
My brother, fly shit that makes Stevie Wonder
Heyyyy, who can it be now watch out
It's the E live in 3-D with Keith and R-E-D
I gets down for my troops
And I ahh... get-it get-it get-it like Luke
For those, who don't believe my skills get these
I got mad expertise, for all you duck MC's
I'm funky like G Thing my nigga
I wanna know who's up in here, before I pull the trigger

(Is New York up in here? HELL YEAH
Is Def Squad up in here? HELL YEAH
Is NJ up in here? HELL YEAH
The Green Beret's up in here! HELL YEAH)

Verse Two: Redman
Verbally, I sew the brains up like Trapper
John M.D. got nine millis made of lacquer
Count Dracula, back with the, tow-truck with the
Get Biz like Mark fuel-injected like Maximus
My style sicker than an AIDS victim drinkin forty-five malt liquors
I roll the spliff up
The underground, slam, shock like Shazam
Check my Jams get Def when I kick Methods like Man
Computerized Robocop sounds I drop in sequence
Funky to death so ask that old bitch where the beef went
When I do em, I glue em, stick em like Patrick Ewing
My shit bumps like Puerto Rican people moved in
Next door, I get raw with the grrrahhhh!
Call four-one-one cause I'm Ghetto Red Hot
Bo bo bo! Funk Doctor Spock catch a bruisin
My style gets respect fifty Muslims
You hang on strings like loose ends, with my hands on the nine
Watch yo nugget bitch, I get busy with mines

(How's that? (cause I gets busy with mines)
How's that? (cause I gets busy with mines)
How's that? (cause I gets busy with mines)
How's that? (cause I gets busy with mines
It's Keith Murray))

Verse Three: Keith Murray
I come rollin in when I see that low flow
Heckuva foe, heard a gun and settled for a metaphor
I'm naive between the sleeves of the sheets
Murderin, who should ever try to fuck with me
Murray word is bond gets it on
And ready to blow any nigga out the cypher of the sniper hype at dawn
Long live Def to the Squad
And we smokin everybody out there, shit it ain't that hard
I brings classic drama microphone enbalmer
Have your momma beg behind bars for your kidneys tomorrow
My murderous apprentice E Dub
Makes hard funk beats that I become part of
When I be like A-E-I-O-U or battle
Niggas be like who who who who who like night owls
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is I shitted, and y'all was with it dig it
