[Intro: Tyrese]
Tyrese!!!

[Keith Murray]: (Tyrese)
Keith Murray!!! (WOO!!!) Def Squad!!! (I like this right here man) Me too
(Keith Murray you did that! Talk to 'em!) Yeah!

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Keith Murray, the lyrical Hannibal flow cannibal
Animalistic tough guy man handle you
I came into this bitch my style hardcore
Then I heard a hater say he ain't fire no more!
What?! That was me standin on your block with the razor blade
In my mouth back when hip hop was hip hop
For those who don't know or forget
To make y'all happy with Mary J. who Puff came to get (Me)
Then who he called for Total to make y'all see (Me)
Then who he called again for Special Delivery (That a be me)
There's nothin you could tell me, I rocked every hole in the wall
Then arena to arena with R. Kelly
Who made you feel beautiful while gettin lifted (Me)
I rocked bells with L you must be stupid
I don't need no permission, to do what I do
Come through and show the whole world how I do

[Hook: Tyrese] (*Keith Murray)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
I'm gonna be right here to get your shit together (*Right here, yo!)

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
And who you know get out of jail and get them figures
Get back into the game like fuck the system
Hit the studio and bless y'all with Fatty Girl
Who got 'em sayin badonkadonk around the world
Now I'm hearin I got anger issues on the street
The only anger I got, is when I'm fuckin up a E beat
Keep runnin' your lips and I'm a have you dancin' like the crips
Turn your six pack to some barbeque rib tips
Mother hot damn this man jam like a phone
And plus the shit I get more draws than a dresser
When I flow, there's no one deafer
Make you make the ugly face like Lamont's Aunt Esther
You can't stealth me my tank is too healthy
Even negative situations help me
When E lace the beat, and me and Ty bust one
Trust son that's money in the bank like a trust fund

[Hook: Tyrese]
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
I'm gonna be right here to get your shit together

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
Yo! Keith Murray is your (?) MC Ultra
With the sickest comeback like nigga I told ya
Honeys sweat me like condensation, mind affiliation
House niggas like the Fannie Mae Foundation
The K don't play fuck around touche' and toupee
What you say get done away like Faye
I rhyme flagrant you sweeter than a sugar fragrance
Ignoramus, blow your brains out on a pavement
The game we been milkin for awhile like a green cow
You seregant MC, that ain't your style
Metaphors dawn on you in time like revelations
Battlin Keith, self mutilation
Let it be sensible, I'll make you invisible
Niggas can't see me the flow is invincible
My style royalty like residuals
You subjectable, hospitable y'all niggas is despicable

[Hook: Tyrese]
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
I'm gonna be right here to get your shit together

[Bridge: Tyrese] (Keith Murray]
Oh his flow is so (Keith Murray, Black Ty) I won't let go (Word up)
Oooh his flow is so, oh!!! I won't let go (Aight here we go)

[Outro: Keith Murray] (Tyrese)
Yeah yeah yeah!!! No doubt (I like the way this feels right here!!!)
It's classical baby (Make me wanna get on the freeway you know in the fast lane)
