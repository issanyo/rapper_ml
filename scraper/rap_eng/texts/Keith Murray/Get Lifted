[Intro]
Uh huh, yeah
One two, one two
"Fire up, fire up this funk if ya have to"
Smokin' up blunts
Mad Dog 2020
"Fire up, fire up this funk if ya"

[Verse 1]
I grab the forty, rip off the skirt
Guzzle it, grab the mic and come out the wood works
When shit's thick and no time to think
Keith Murray gets busy off of Basic Instinct
I puff an L and drink some liquor
Sit down and write a jam that receive the muhfuckin' stick-up
As God as my witness, with the sickness of a cannibalist cannabis
I floats like a cumulus
My perpetual rebel intellectual
Won't catch a bad experience with hallucinogenics either
I float strictly with the cannabis sativa
As my speech falls deeper than the scriptures
And graphic opponents, just like Picasso paintin' pictures
If my eyes ain't red, it's all in my head
Once said by a Ph.D med
Legalize and I'll advertise, 'cause

[Refrain]
"I get lifted"
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
"Fire up, fire up this funk if ya have to"
Yeah, like that y'all
Yeah word up
"I get lifted"
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
"Fire up this funk, fire up this funk"

[Verse 2]
This the real deal, not a publicity stunt
I gets high like if the man in the Moon be puffing blunts
But verily, barely, merrily, is it dope or the dream?
Step into my chamber of intravenous smokescreen
I captivate it then motivate it, jealous of my desire
Smoke it down to the fire, anything to get a little higher
Hop in to college, but to be truthfully frank
Weed is knowledge, cause it makes me think
I pick anatomy and hem reality like Jah
Rastas read the bible, after puffin sensimillia
And the Sensi it gets me as a fly
I ain't bullshittin', you can ask Bill Clinton, he can verify that

[Refrain]
"I get lifted"
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
"Fire up, fire up this funk if ya have to"
Yeah, like that y'all
Yeah word up
"I get lifted"
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
"Fire up this funk, fire up this funk"

[Verse 3]
Step into this intersection and take this rap
I got a vicious plot, but first take me by the weed spot
I do this for my niggas locked down runnin' capers
Smokin herb, in the bible papers
But how does it feel when you got no fire
And kyant pass de dutchie pon de left hand side
What the fuck? Who the fuck wanna fuck with the six shot shooter?
I murder you over buddha
What I discuss'll bust a rhyme style nucleus
And roast them ghostes, puffin hocus-pocus
So kid, pass that bomb trom, word bond
So I can toke it with more wins than a python
Different Strokes for different folks
He like the chocolate Thai, you like to float with the green skunky smoke
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized to the funky sound 'cause

[Refrain]
"I get lifted"
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
"Fire up, fire up this funk if ya have to"
Yeah, like that y'all
Yeah word up
"I get lifted"
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
"Fire up this funk, fire up this funk"
