[Intro]
(Yeah this the build up) OH NO!
You knew we was coming back
But you ain't know we was coming back like this
C'mon, it's gon' be a problem ya'll
(Yeah uh huh, Keith Murray, Def Jam, Def Squad)
Keith Murray gon' make you go uh - uh uh uh
(How it's gon' be)
Def Squad gonna make you go ah - ooh ooh ah

[Verse]
I come on stomping mud holes in tracks like Timbaland
The producer and the booth, niggas so don't get cute
I come through in the coupe with the chopped off roof
Humiliate you then blast you in your birthday suit
You a small side order of apple cider
I'm a three hot's in a cot dungeon rider
My hardcore street team crash the party with Def Jam
And Incorporate +Murda+ like +Gotti+
How about in back of the yellow cab like Seinfeld
Chew you like little neck clams on half shells
I got a hypochondriac flow that get real ill
Get nautious to the beat, I spit sick at will
And the time has come and your shit is sour
You need to turn your flow up an hour
Give you a permanent lean, like the Pais Tower
With a hoes that will wet you down like a cold shower

[Chorus]
Yo we got the shit on lock (uh huh)
Come through and blast the spot (yeah man)
And my name is the record, so check it, when I put it on record
Everybody say oh my goodness!
And my folks if you with me where you at? (yes sir)
If you love what I'm doing holla back (talk to me)
And when I step on the scene, a lean mean wrecking machine
Everybody scream oh my goodness!

[Verse]
And yeah I hear you talking motherfucker write the check
And if you in the house then protect your neck
I'm 'Mister See You Anywhere It's Gon' Be A Showdown'
So ya'll better have lyrics when I come 'round
Cause I ain't lost a battle since God knows when
Some niggas tried to front but they gots no win
Taught how to prevent to lose and handle the win
Like birds are made to fly and fish made to swim
Wait a minute homie you don't really know me homie
I'll take you to a picnic boy you lunch meat
With my dazzling appearance and my world wide clearance
I am treacherous, inferio, impermanent, impetuous
I rock like an archeologist
Draw a picture like a forensic artist, perform like a dramatist
I'm fabulously wicked, miraculous
Rustic, majestic, ridiculous, oh my goodness

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Keith Murray gon' make you go uh - uh uh uh
Def Squad gon' make you go ah - ooh ooh ah
Oh my goodness!
Keith Murray gon' make you go uh - uh uh uh
Def Squad gon' make you go ah - ooh ooh ah
Oh my goodness!

[Verse]
And you in line motherfucker like them people in court
So when I see you I'm a pop your top like a cork
I pack flow like ammo, spit like camels
Come through and bless your whole crew like (achoo)
But some still wanna holla, pop they collar
Fucking with me like I run a funeral parlor
Linguist lyricist out for +Chips+ like +Estrada+
Bilingual emcees even couldn't even couldn't do me nada
With this mic I'm handy, flows be dandy
It's a +Full Moon+ and hoes wanna fuck like +Brandy+
Yeah I've been hated on, you probably heard it
And I kicked their little ass but them niggas deserved it
And I'm still in the hood and I still rep the hood
Still +Tee'ing Off+ for a +Long Green+ like +Tiger Woods+
I ain't even gotta say it, ya'll know when it's hot
So ya'll go back up in the vocal box

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Uh - uh uh uh
Ah - ooh ooh ah
Oh my goodness!
Keith Murray gon' make you go uh - uh uh uh
Def Squad gon' make you go ah - ooh ooh ah
Oh my goodness!
