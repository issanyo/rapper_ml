[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Now for next to little or nothin' I be rippin' up every function
With scientifical mad man consumptions
With mass productions of mass conjunctions
I display new ways of MC destruction
Cause ain't nothin' better than the shit I got
Makin' niggas jump off the roof and roof-tops
I put the hip in hop and the don't in stop
And the clips in Glocks, then I rock box your block
My hypothesis on this is
You niggas better come in terms of my vocabulary quick
Or get dissed, my brain bleeds mental complex feeds
Bring it on kid I got exactly what you need
Twisted metaphors to get your ass in star wars
Im'a live forever like Bob Marley just because
The mad matador metaphor rips the hard core
For him and his them and theirs you and yours

[Hook: Keith Murray]
And it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I said it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I keep it jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
We keep it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy
Cause it be jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
And it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
The most beautifullest vocabulist
Punches phony mc's dead in their esophogaus
My analysis is roughly callouses
You better practice if you want to challenge this
I'm symbolic to the sun moon and stars
You gettin' knocked out the box no matter who you are
The funk phat tracks lures you to listen
As my vocals send your brain up in the fetal position
Learn a quick lesson of mic aggression
So when I walk down the street there'll be no second guessing
Now you can walk the walk talk the talk
Pack burners all day but your still fireproof like an ashtray
I'm a scientist in the mix like Plyx
Turnin' all you fly emcees back into maggots
Top prop soil watch me bubble and spoil
Punch you Grand Royal as you foam like boil

[Hook: Keith Murray]
And it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I said it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I keep it jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
We keep it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy
Cause it be jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
And it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
I played the many thousand roles of street life
Showed Houdini that the freaks come out in broad daylight
Me and my crew be tight like Lavren and Shirley
Rollin' through all ya'lls hoods pullin all ya'lls fly girlies
Emcee's always bitchin', that makes my style all hard
I roll with nobody but God and the Squad
Me and my troops be knockin niggas out the sides of Zeus
Lettin the OJ juice loose on phat tracks E-d produced

[Hook: Keith Murray]
And it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I said it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I keep it jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
We keep it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy
Cause it be jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
And it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy
