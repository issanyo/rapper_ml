50 Grand:
Now this is something for your white behinds and black minds
If you fuck with 50 Grand your bound to never shine
Me and the mics a love affair permanate warfare
I'd rather die in here then have to live this life in fear
I need eternal riches and bitches don't ask for forgiveness
Thuggin' senseless out for my paper relentless
My streets is watchin' my crew like they watching you
I keep the heat for whoever wanna see if it's true
We be on the block rain sunshine hail with the scale
Only slang when the coke price fail you frail
I'm smooth as silk don't milk off the shit I built
That's fucked up like the day I heard my mans got killed
Amneon Robinson and Shakim real thugs to the end
Rest in peace till we meet my friend
These cats want beef don't wet that I'll bless that
Make sure these herbs and they fake crew don't live to regret that

Hook:
This is something for your stank behinds and washed minds
If you front on 50 Grand you're bound to never shine     (x2)

Keith Murray:
First of all I gotta give thanks and praise
To L.O.D., grace and mercy broung me through many days
A lot of people that I loved passed away
And I never thought I would have to face life this way
And for those that live in the poverty stricken
Beggin' for forgivenness cause they know God is listenin'
But we forced to keep the hollow tips whistlin'
Man listen we ain't sweatin' no competition
And if I cry I cry flames
It's a damn shame they wait to scandalis the name
They wanna see us back on the block or locked by the cops
Or shot like Biggie Smalls and 2Pac (rest in peace my niggas)
Run it I never fronted
I got my whole crews life on it
Bet y'all niggas don't want it
From Calimazu to Timbutu like Sem said I'll find you
Camelflaush couldn't hide you
So get our shit to us all we deserve
Save the fly shit for the motherfuckin' birds
Word to Dris, Apple, Shawn plus it be half of us
Roll with the rush or get your ass bust

Hook

Keith Murray outro:
This is for you backstabbers comin' from behind
If you front on mine you're bound to never shine
