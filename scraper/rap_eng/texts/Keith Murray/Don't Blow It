I stand on your steps
A few minutes left
I was holding out for you
Your last cigarette is still on your breath
And I was embracing the haze
But you're a mess
And I was impressed by just about anything
Whatever you said
Went straight to my head

Now there's nothin else that you can say
We might as well just do this

When we talk about love
Its not a discussion
If you want it enough
Then you got to do something
And you need to know this
Please don't blow it now

If you know that we should
And its not worth debating
If its already good
Then what good is waiting
And you need to know this
Please don't blow it now

You're [?]
You liven the room
I could use a tending to
Theres crumbs in the rug
We've blown every bulb
But I love the taste of the place
There's poison in thoughts
But when you were blonde
It looked way too much like you
I got to admit you've got me convinced

Now theres nothin else that you can say
We might as well just do this

When we talk about love
Its not a discussion
If you want it enough
Then you got to do something
And you need to know this
Please don't blow it now

If you know that we should
And its not worth debating
If its already good
Then what good is waiting
And you need to know this
Please don't blow it now

Oh I don't need an answer
Oh I don't need an answer
No I don't need an answer

'Cause
Now theres nothin else that you can say
We might as well just do this

When we talk about love
Its not a discussion
If you want it enough
Then you got to do something
And you need to know this
Please don't blow it now

If you know that we should
And its not worth debating
If its already good
Then what good is waiting
And you need to know this
Please don't blow it now
And you need to know this
Please don't blow it now
And you need to know this
Please don't blow it now
