[Intro]
Brother remember, remember what momma used to say
We'll get over it, we won't stay under it

[Hook]
Momma wasn't rich (unh uh) my dady was poor (uh huh)
I couldn't take no more (I had to get my hustle on)
Momma wasn't rich (unh uh) my dady was poor (uh huh)
I couldn't take no more (I had to get my hustle on)
Momma wasn't rich (unh uh) my dady was poor (uh huh)
I couldn't take no more (I had to get my hustle on)
Momma wasn't rich (unh uh) my dady was poor (uh huh)
I couldn't take no more (I had to get my hustle on)

[Verse 1]
Growin' up I ain't never had nothin'
Had to get out in the streets and get myself somethin', feel me
Chillin' wit the Legion of Doom at an early age
Watchin' all the older niggas in the hood get paid
Yo I knew I could get it if I wanted to
Cause I lived on the corner where all the base heads came through
So it was only write that I get me just do B
Shit, I ain't choose hustlin', hustlin' chose me
This my block, I live here I sell drugs here
Let a nigga come through and slit my throat
I dare I swear, I got the tre eight in the tree
And the guage is right over there! Where?
In the bushes for you douches with one eye out
A nigga keep lookin'
For the police and them base heads juxin'
Shit, I looked for a job, but that ain't last long
I couldn't take it any more
I had to get my hustle on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now I'm addicted to Carlton Ave servin' the hood
My basketball coach told my moms and that ain't good
I'd hide when she slide through every chance I could
She said "Boy I see you tryin' to get back over in them woods
Wher u get the new sneakers from I know I ain bought 'em"
I told her "Freeport mall, my uncle Tejuan bought 'em"
I grew up around hustlers, she knew I'd try it
She asked me was I doin' it you know I denied it
But I was tired
I wanted what I wanted when I wanted it
Fuck the consequeces I knew just how get
Cop that, cook that, chop that, pitch that
Save that, get stacks, fresh kicks, new hat
Carhartt, new boots, more smoke, more loot
Have crack, get dough, just like rap
Baseheads came back for the hit
My neighbors lookin' cause of the traffic
Man, but fuck that shit
