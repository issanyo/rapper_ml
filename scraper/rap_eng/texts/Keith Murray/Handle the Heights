[Young Girl]
He's Almighty, They can handle the heights
Show em what time it is

[Hook: Canibus, (Killah Priest sample)]
(Everybody can't emcee)
Can you handle the heights, Can you manage the life
Start spittin some lyrical shit that I could listen to
(Everybody can't emcee)
Yeah, Can you handle the heights, Watch how I handle this mic

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, Been through shit past, Remove your mask
I blow nerve gas through chicken wire at your ass
Prepare protocols yall, I declare war
Butt stock to the skull til the last man fall
I'm an H2O buffalo, A maelstrom produces my undertow
A slow process you must undergo
Javelin Fangz, Shit bang you in the head with a bang stick
See if you can bang like this
I am black Pegasus, I escort the Albatross
Sagittarius archers serve as my ground force
You shot costal, Gout sprout from your mouth
My drop white phosphorus bombs, I'm snow clouds
Come around un-announced, Zombies crawl out the ground
My team's authorized to gun em down
Look alive, Look lively, Lie to a motherfucker
Die to my posse on Broadway, Catch a body

[Hook 2: Canibus, (Killah Priest sample), {​M-80}​]
Can you handle the heights
(Everybody can't emcee) Can you manage the life
Start spittin some lyrical shit that I could listen to
Can you handle the heights
(Everybody can't emcee) {​Watch how I handle this mic}​
Start spittin some lyrical shit that I could listen to

[Verse 2: M-80]
I can handle it, The Los Angeles mic evangelous
Ignite flows like a candle stick when strictly out my manuscript
What I do for success is considered a threat
Your best bet against all odds, bullets spray ya rap barrage (If I) Didn’t have what it takes, I would’ve stolen it
Shift, Shaped and molded it and called it my own
So when I dictate my dialect a scientist revivalist, Its highly obvious M-80’s home on his thrown (If I)
Was in your shoes I would save up some funds
Do knowledge of self then reflect in a pair of new ones
So you would know how it feels to appeal to those
Who value your heart and sole more then your cushioned insoles
(If I) Gave a what, I would want a receipt
So I could write you off like taxes every time that you speak
I was born to compete amongst a swarm of unique and intelligent emcees
While your destiny is prone for defeat

[Hook 2: Canibus, (Killah Priest sample), {​Bronze Nazareth}​]
Can you handle the heights
(Everybody can't emcee) Can you manage the life
Start spittin some lyrical shit that I could listen to
Can you handle the heights, {​Yeah, Watch me handle this mic}​
(Everybody can't emcee) {​Gun Rule vandal in sight}​
Start spittin some lyrical shit that I could listen to

[Verse 3: Bronze Nazareth]
Ayo, I spit heat serum, Beat clearin shots at your sternum
Burn em and send home our post cards to the sermon
Dirty vermin with shiny crowns and their dirty gloves
Show me thirty rounds, One for love, Bringing in slugs
I speak life sentences, Trapped in the years
Words escape like inmates from trapped between ears
Practice crackin sutures, Pollution from mutual war
My thoughts on a theatre ship like Lincoln on the ball floor
Keep the Magnum P.I. on top of it prophet
Detroit West burglars with murderer's logic
Pin point chest and vertebrae, Burn through your topic
Serve'n multitudes of fraudulent emcees be the conquest
We send warning gas, Harass like mad snacks
We toast, We crack glass, Smoke hash through Alaskan pipe line
Recite grenades, Bronze sonic mind
Runnin in front of the grim reaper, I'm ahead of my time

[Hook 4: Canibus, (Killah Priest sample), {​Keith Murray}​]
Can you handle the heights
(Everybody can't emcee) Can you manage the life
Start spittin some lyrical shit that I could listen to
Can you handle the heights
{​Yo, Yo, Check how I handle this mic}​
(Everybody can't emcee)
Start spittin some lyrical shit that I could listen to

[Verse 4: Keith Murray]
Ayo, Everybody and they Momma wanna rhyme
So I hit em with more power then a molecule enzyme
Rappers persist to rock a mic like this
But ain't mentally spiritually lyrically physically fit
You are not accustomed to my blows to the chest
I wear you down like post traumatic stress
I got too much mental capacity
For an uneducated street punk to fuck with me
I drink like a fish, Got a memory like an elephant
Submission specialist, Murder emcees excellence
Peep the rug scheme and the way I mounty it
My colloquialism is in the slang I pronunciate
Metaphorically can't be challenge'n but not meant to complicate
I eat emcees, Rappers I regurgitate
You ain't even gotta be considered talented to be considered exceptionable
In this hip hop profession, Meritocracy is the standard status quo yo
And every Joe lip professor
Before you open your mouth make sure you can run that route
Before you get knocked the fuck out

[Outro: Keith Murray]
Yeah, Can you handle the heights
Yeah, Check how I handle this mic
Uh, Yeah, Can you handle the life
Uh, Yeah, Nigga, Get your game up
If I catch you it's a problem...
