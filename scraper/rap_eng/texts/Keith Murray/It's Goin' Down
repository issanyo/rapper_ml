[Erick Sermon]

[Ed Lover]

Bow to the wow, yippie yo yippie yay
It's the Ed Lover with my OWN Dr. Dre
Special shout out, to the D-O-double-G
They can't tame ya so they framed ya for a 187 G
With a bow wow whoa, let me go, let me know
Lettin ya know I'm still down with my homies down below
And ain't nuttin changed, ain't a damn thing strange
First name is still Ed, my middle name is still James
But hold up, wait!  Let me pause for the cause
I'm bustin all them suckers that be givin up them drawers
Let them slide up in your back, for a fat contract
More Famous than Amos, but your shit is still wack!
And Calvin Klein's, no friend of mine
I only Karl Kani's, on my behind
So when you see me comin nigga gots to break wild
Ed Lover, Ed got love - for the other side

Chorus: [Ed Lover] + (Erick Sermon)

(Ed Lover, is in the house)
(Dr. Dre..)

[Keith Murray]
Now Keith Murray's in a hurry quick fast
To get up in that ass with some ol' ill shit, and a paragraph
All y'all rappers comin with that happy-dappy
Scared to be nappy shit makes me wanna laugh
Believe me you I'll come through with a crew
That's sicker than the flu
You couldn't even take these niggas to the zoo
Cause when I rap competition perform disappearin acts
And I jam like Smuckers
My style is funky like a six-pack of motherfuckers
Murray emphasizes on rough poetry
With formality, with no sympathy
I'm on the MC killer streak like John Wayne Gacy
With the funk, which is essentional with my recipe
And I'm beatin Mother Nature down to her knees
By makin more papers than trees, niggas please - it's goin down

Chorus: [Ed Lover] + (Erick Sermon)

It's goin DOWWWN!  (Uhh like this y'all)
(It's goin down like this like that y'all)
Y'all niggas don't fuck around
It's goin DOWWWN!  (Word 'em up like that y'all)
(It's goin down like this word 'em up)
Heyyyyy, it's goin DOWWWN!
(Yeah, it's goin down like this y'all)
(Like that like this y'all)
All the ladies in the 90's y'all, it's goin DOWWWN!
(It's goin down, it's goin down like this y'all)
Now this what I want all y'all ladies to say
Say this right, come over here
