Come on, yeah
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
I'm stanking strong, 23 years old, now
With the big, bang boogie and the big pow pow
Not much, just keepin' it tight
With the Philly Blunt King gettin' high as a kite
I got no time for bullshittin', I have to start lickin'
'Cause niggas get jeal off the shit Kel be kickin'
Get your free head up 'cause I'm seven foot tall
And I ain't scared of none of y'all, this shit is off the wall
I be the genie in your lamp, the face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker stompin' all through your camp
We went from smokin' weed in bullen therapy
To takin' suckers out on national TV
So on and so on, furthermore in other words
We kick niggas heads to the curb
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
I shook hands all across the land from here to Japan
Back to the motherland up to Canada
Nigga, I'll Jeru the Damaja
Your rap style is weak and it has no stamina
Ayyo, this is for the big quzzlers
Gun smugglers, drug jugglers and the chelua puffers
Mister Armor to all, you gonna take a fall
For tryin' to walk before you crawl
We'll kick 120 rhymes in 60 seconds
Niggas standing on the sideline feeling disrespected
While I dissected your shit get ejected
I got Kel-Vicious, the malicious next to wreck it
We can make this shit hot or we can keep it cool
But as soon as a nigga violate the rules
I get the spot hot quick, yo, Kel be illin' and shit
'Cause I be comin' down the block with the pistol grip
With all this violence in the world, how could I not be a crook?
I could stick a nigga up with my mean fuckin' looks
Make a bitch drop her draws, grab the microphone and pause
There's many casualties of war, Killer Kel is at the door
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
I be the mad, mad scientist, mad conquesting
Getting quick dough like off-track betting
Overall, y'all niggas be dead on arrival
Meanwhile, me and Kel be buggin' off survival
My supportin' cast will bust that ass
I got a beeper and a phone but you can find me on the Ave
Y'all niggas definitely ain't got nothing fur us
We'll take it to the streets on Stallone and Chuck Norris
You want a wake up call, I got the itchy finger, y'all
Can't be sleeping on the block 'cause that's when I clock
And it's New Jack City, smacking motherfuckers out like bitties
Boy, you're bad, boy, you're rude, boy, you're vicious
Fuck it, niggas, get bust now for lookin' suspicious
I got a 9, pack 9 lives like a cat
Word is bond, niggas try to bust, I bust 'em back
And I don't give a fuck about me or you
I damage your whole family, plus, your crew
