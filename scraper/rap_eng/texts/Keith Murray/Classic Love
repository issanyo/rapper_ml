Before I settle down
One last anyone
Unless I do this now
It's never getting done

'Cause classic love isn't good enough anymore
Classic love isn't good enough anymore

Forget what's buried deep
It isn't what you think
With promises to keep
Just keep on surfacing

Classic love isn't good enough anymore
Classic love isn't good enough anymore

If there's something you thought was worth waiting for
Let it go, you won't want it anymore

'Cause classic love isn't good enough anymore, oh
Classic love isn't good enough anymore
