[Intro]
Oh yeah
The Mechanics
Livewire
Oh yeah

[Verse 1: J. Stalin]
Yeah, young Stalin know how to treat a bitch
Know how to talk to 'em, I know how to get a bitch
I never put the cuffs on baby
Keep it pimpin' but lady, she know it's all gravy
I done did a lot of dirt so my exes hate me
But they still would recommend a bitch to date me
Know I'm in chasin' money, I takin' trips and buy whips
And you can fuck with me if you want to
But if you don't, that's cool, I ain't gon' chase you
I'm the type of nigga, I'ma do what a mack do
Hit the cat then tell you I be back, boo
She say them other niggas cool but they ain't like you
You put it in too deep and make me bite you
When you don't answer your phone, I wanna fight you
These bitches is cute but they ain't got your style baby
I don't wanna fight, girl, I'll throw in the towel
You know that pussy wetter than the Nile
So when you ready you can hit me on the dial
I don't wanna fight, I'll throw in the towel
So when you ready you can hit me on the dial

[Hook: Shady Nate]
I'm a playa, bitch
That pimpin' don't stop for the mayor, bitch
Professional when I lay a bitch
Keep it on the ho, never pay a bitch
'Cause I'm a Livewire
When I'm on the hoes
Can't get out the door, they like "there he go"
Just lettin' niggas know that I'm locked and hot
So watch it when I flash 'cause you might get shot
Just see the Livewire

[Verse 2: Fam Syrk]
You see me on your TV and you hear me on your radio
Everytime I ride by them hoes like "there he go"
I'm gettin' big bucks, baby zip your lip up
Damned if you see me out here trickin' on these rip nuts
While you lovin' the lights I'm takin' flights, B
See me in the traffic, ain't no tellin' where I might be
Don't need a nascar for me to drive fast
From the home of the 18 swimmin' in the gas
And you can ask Jay Jonah, I'm on the corner
Bitch, I'm a Livewire, Oakland, California
Ones, we be gettin' them, the homies feel this snitchin' them
Turn them into thousands, big bundles, we pitchin' in
I'm gettin' higher, big rims, small tires
From the one they call sayer and it's all Livewire
And I'm flyer than them niggas that you used to
All I got is good pipe since you can get used to

[Hook: Shady Nate]
I'm a playa, bitch
That pimpin' don't stop for the mayor, bitch
Professional when I lay a bitch
Keep it on the ho, never pay a bitch
'Cause I'm a Livewire
When I'm on the hoes
Can't get out the door, they like "there he go"
Just lettin' niggas know that I'm locked and hot
So watch it when I flash 'cause you might get shot
Just see the Livewire

[Verse 3: Dotrix 4000]
Smooth operator, Big Daddy Kane
You girl on my line when the sex on her brain
All in them pockets, and the purse and the puss
Fall through the magnums, smellin' like kush
Boyfriend gone, she quick to pick a fight
Y'all already cashed out, she just need dick tonight
I come and bang her like a nail
From the front to back, got her screamin' Dontrell
In and out the back door, I leave her so pale
Gaspin' for air, she was swimmin' with a whale
I'm a deep diver, just a Livewire
Got her on fire, see, daddy never fail
She paid for the goodness, keep it on the hush
And everything was gravy 'til that one night
Don't be mad at the player, be mad at the game
That's just how it is cus cus

[Hook: Shady Nate]
I'm a playa, bitch
That pimpin' don't stop for the mayor, bitch
Professional when I lay a bitch
Keep it on the ho, never pay a bitch
'Cause I'm a Livewire

Just lettin' niggas know that I'm locked and hot
So watch it when I flash 'cause you might get shot
Just see the Livewire
