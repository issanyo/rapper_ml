[Verse 1: Shady Nate]
First it was the O's, the A's and then K's
She been on the blade 3 months and ten days
Hundred nights hustlin bitch but I been paid
Countin' in the attic to see what a pimp made
Hella bandanas stacked up in a shoebox
Incognito I only rock with a few knocks
Straight drop be keepin' the block hot
But still a chop in the trunk of the I-Rocc
Saucy don't cross me, bossing gets costly
When you stop talkin bout' the money's when ya lost me
Bay area ni**as bury ya in an instant
And I'ma keep this shit lit like an insence
Hollows in my ralo, Anywhere that I go
Rockin since Demolition men ni**a Bono
Been a real nigga got models ready to swallow
Money Power Respect and the rest gon follow


[Hook: Einer Bankz]
I'm accurate wit the spit don't play with me
And I keep this shit lit it's the same routine
Wake ya hustle game up if you can call it that
It's money, power, respect an the rest gon' follow that
Accurate wit the spit don't play with me
And I keep this shit lit it's the same routine
Wake ya hustle game up if you can call it that
It's money, power, respect an the rest gon' follow that


[Verse 2: AG Cubano]
Just ran through a record deal
All I do is rap and chill
All I know is trap forreal, these niggas soft as daffodils
Still you know I'm packin steel
They throwin clips like packages
Still you know I'm crackin seals
Buss em' down on mattresses
Breakin bread with savages
Nigga I'm just after this
Paper with the magic strips
From the land of mack-ya-bitch
Started with a safety clip, bubble game immaculate
None of this on accident
I'm accurate wit the spit you can ask ya bitch
Fuckin ask ya side chick didn't know she had a side pimp
From the island, Me and Shady been tied in
Livewire one in the lining
I could put you on consignment, I'm puttin on some mileage
I could put you on some knowledge, I'm just focused on the dollars, I'm tryin to get through today but still plottin' on tomorrow, It's money power respect and the rest gon' follow

[Hook: Einer Bankz]
I'm accurate wit the spit don't play with me
And I keep this shit lit it's the same routine
Wake ya hustle game up if you can call it that
It's money, power, respect an the rest gon' follow that
Accurate wit the spit don't play with me
And I keep this shit lit it's the same routine
Wake ya hustle game up if you can call it that
It's money, power, respect an the rest gon' follow that
