[Pre-Chorus]
Aye, when they ask me how I got it tell 'em off the corner
Preach nigga never had a high school diploma
If you came up in the struggle you a friend of me
Favor for favor, your enemy my enemy

[Chorus]
Your enemy my enemy
Favor for favor, your enemy my enemy
If you came up in the struggle you a friend of me
Favor for favor, your enemy my enemy

[Verse 1: Shady Nate]
I am the face of the struggle
Product of my environment I'm embracing the hustle
Stay ready like a fireman
Can't do nothing but love you
When you get forced out of retirement
I was destined to bubble
Bullets flashing and firing
I was a little nigga, coming up out of the gutter
When niggas kill niggas, they send you up to your mother
Quick as the steel hits, mama told me to never trust 'em
And if a nigga ever try to play you better bust 'em
No discussing, I was banging the drum like percussion
Niggas losing they life over bottles of Robitussin
It's the wild wild west side
Where the real niggas ride and the rest die

[Pre-Chorus]
When they ask me how I got it tell 'em off the corner
Preach nigga never had a high school diploma
If you came up in the struggle you a friend of me
Favor for favor, your enemy my enemy

[Chorus]
Your enemy my enemy
Favor for favor, your enemy my enemy
If you came up in the struggle you a friend of me
Favor for favor, your enemy my enemy

[Bridge]
Little nigga P Gang, stop always trying to be a wolf. Learn how to play the fox sometimes. Be cool, calm, and collected, and at the end of the day, you gonna get that lamb chop

[Verse 2: Shady Nate]
I can't fuck with no silver spoon fed ass nigga
No pillow talking to bitches in bed ass nigga
Probably talking to the feds ass nigga
Speaking on my name better ask the last nigga
Same nigga said they love you try to do you in
That's why I play these niggas closer than a fucking violin (say to be cool my nigga they watching your every move)
That's why I play these niggas closer than a fucking violin
I ain't into taking losses, bitch I'm in this shit to win
Damn still doing time off of shit we did as kids
I gotta better my position for the future of my kids
Nana, Baby 380, and Little Sid

[Pre-Chorus]
Aye, when they ask me how I got it tell 'em off the corner
Preach nigga never had a high school diploma
If you came up in the struggle you a friend of me
Favor for favor, your enemy my enemy

[Chorus]
Your enemy my enemy
Favor for favor, your enemy my enemy
If you came up in the struggle you a friend of me
Favor for favor, your enemy my enemy
