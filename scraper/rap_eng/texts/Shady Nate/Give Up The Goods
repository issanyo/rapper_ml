[Verse 1: 1-O.A.K.]
One taste got you craven
Almost feels good misbehaving
What was unintentional is now unapologetic
Things could get out of hand only if you let it
I know she got a man with all her needs met except one
And I know what she wants
She waits until he’s gone
To call me on the phone
And I took her down it was easy to do it
Idle hands make mischievous music
Now I just rock what a nigga earned
But then again that ain’t my concern

[Chorus: 1-O.A.K.]
She giving up, giving up, giving up that good
To the thief in the night taking what I like
They say I’m in the wrong but I do it right
That’s why she giving up, giving up, giving up that good
To the thief in the night, taking just what I like

[Verse 2: 1-O.A.K.]
We made a pack with no promises
A little heart to heart with the heartless
It’s your body there and I’m breaking in
When I pick your lock I’m taking everything
If the world only knew the way your body moved
The night would leave me lonely
While you’re out doing your own thang
So I smashed and grabbed it was easy to do it
The door was open so I walked straight through it
And I only want the best
Cause no regrets when her needs ain’t met

[Chorus: 1-O.A.K.]
So she giving up, giving up, giving up that good
To the thief in the night taking what I like
They say I’m in the wrong but I do it right
That’s why she giving up, giving up, giving up that good
To the thief in the night taking just what I like

[Verse 3: Shady Nate]
One man's trash is the next man’s treasure
Busting bad bitches this is just my guilty pleasure
And this ain’t how it’s supposed to be
She know a nigga close to me
Crossing him like a rosary
And never saying no to me
Don’t get it twisted for a second
I’m not your man boo
I’m just trying to turn you on
To something that he won’t do
Maybe what he can’t do
Cause he’s stuck up on the sofa
Same sofa you was on
Sweating like a super soaker swimming pool
So they call her slipping slide little one
Blowing up my line
Any time she ain’t feeling him
When he leave I slide through
Hit it to the base line
She can see me when she want
I got your ho on face time
Giving up the good good
Taking everything I like
Smash and grab then I’m taking off like a thief in the night, tonight
And this ain’t never been my type of hype
But if it’s wrong I don’t want to be right

[Chorus: 1-O.A.K.]
She giving up, giving up, giving up that good
To the thief in the night taking what I like
They say I’m in the wrong but I do it right
That’s why she giving up, giving up, giving up that good
To the thief in the night taking just what I like
