[Intro.]
Hold up Racks! Cool that money counter off
Play another mixtape mob exclusive
Lean wit me man. This my bo' song baby
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout. That purple, that red
East to the West you're now rocking with the mixtape mob motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Dubbe-20]
I got a fo' take yo' ass to the sto' and bitch hurr' up
All I like to do is get dough and drink syrup
Dump it in the 2 liter Sprite before I stir up
Here take a couple of kisses but don't murder my mix
Stingy when it comes to that codeine
Junkie for the prometh', guess I'm a bo' fiend
Get it from the dope fiends they trade it for more cream
Only purple and the red, cause that yellow shit be morphine
See bruh? I'm hooked like an addict
Keep it in the freezer, not the medicine cabinet
Doctor prescribed to get high when I want
I eat it on my waffles and smoke it on my blunts, uh-huh
It make the weed burn slow
Everytime I fuck with [?] we pour up
Everytime I ride with royal we be sippin'
Sleepy but never slippin' grape flavor on my lips, man

[Hook X2: K Breeze]
If you're rollin' with my team
You hustlin' in these streets
Gettin' money all day, sippin' bottles of lean
We stay hustlin', leanin', smokin', leanin'
Ridin' we leanin' my whole team we leanin'

[Verse 2: Shady Nate]
A true bo-fessional, leanin' and countin' money
'bo and Sprite on ice whenever the weather's sunny
You can lean with the kid-kid when your 'tussin dry
Make sure you return the favor when you see I ain't high
I tip it like Dubb-20, I guzzle like Brunna Banna
Pulled up with that brick of that 'tussin
Them hoes went bananas, it's a celebration
When I get my hands on it
If you ain't really on it and ask me I don't condone it
It's a privilege like Hennesy, the syrup's the remedy
I hear you can make a killin' if you dealin' in Tennessee
Recipe's Pimp C, and shout out to the Jets
I'm a be tippin' on the syrup 'till my last breath
The feeling's mutual, if you think it's beautiful
So I made an album 'bout my favorite pharmaceutical (bo-fessional!)
And when I get it I sip it just for the team
If you up in my circle with that purple, my nigga then you gone lean
