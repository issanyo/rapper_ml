[Hook]
[X3]I know I got these haters mad, I can love that
When you got love for the streets they give you love back

Look in my eyes, you can tell I ain't never scared
Popping them thangs, I'm rocking my chain anywhere

[Verse 1: A Plus Tha Kid]

Look up in the sky: it's a bird, it's a plane
What's that nigga name? It say it on his chain
Vogues on the wheels, still gripping on the grain
Cashed out for the yandy and spray it on the frame
Blame it on the game; niggas hating, what a shame
Getting it around the world while you waiting for the fame
120 on the bo, pour another four
Gotta have mine though, for the halftime show
I'mma let it be known: boy a bitch ain't nothing
I'm from the part of town where the pimps ain't cuffing
Gangstas ain't telling, we ain't never saying nothing
I love to just listen when the russian K busting
Shitting on 'em stay flushing; Shady Nate and A Plussin'
Before I ever started rapping I was hustling
And we don't ever change our minds, we just adjust them
Come through tryna crush them, everything custom...

(Hook)

[Verse 2: Shady Nate]

For roaches I spray pesticide, and all the rest could ride
My cream machine make fiends do the electric slide
Fuck talking about the money and let's collide
Push up on the block and get your lyrical exercise
Rocking with my cock out, that just mean the Glock out
It's smacking at the trap house, so I'mma take the back route
Bitches in the kitchen whipping with titties and ass out
I turned her to a marketing genius during my last drought
Plenty green by any means, give me money or give me lean
They know about that lean team, propane game and them beam things
From Folsom up to Sing SIng, Fresno to Oakland
Pistol promoting, look in my eyes it's no joking
Stay smoking the best of grapes, lil nigga pour up (syrup)
Planes, trains and thangs, another city to sow up
But so what? Shoulder to shoulder you see the tat
I got love in the hood so I'm giving it back

(Hook)

[Verse 3: A Plus Tha Kid]

A Plus and Shady Nate, running like it's '88
Beating down your block, slapping clapping off your lady ?
Niggas mad at the paint, cause it make the hoes faint
Suckas wanna try to end me but can't, I'm well trained
No backing down, I ain't; tryna play me I'm going mainey though
Mama's only living sons, put that on my aunty though
Rest in peace Oakland Spodie, just bought a truck; E-40
And beat the case because the people had nothing on me
Real shit fuck a phony, no friends all fam
Straight up out the Ranchwood, fuck doing the talking
I'm just tryna ball man, put me in the game coach
Hanging out the Range Rove I can let the thang go
Murdering from my angle, stripes like a Bangle
Do this for the bangers with monitors on they ankle
I know I got the haters mad, I could love that
When you got love in the streets they give you love back...

(Hook)
