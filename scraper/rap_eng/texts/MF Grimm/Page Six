[Hook: MF Grimm]
The world will help you climb ‘cause they
Love a superstar
Someone has to crash and burn, so they
Love a superstar, and, yes
I’m a superstar
Darling of PR, papa-
-razzi shoot from close and far
Even in private, no moments alone

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
I heard he’s been through Hell
Do his rap music really sell?
Among the elite, will he prevail?
Is he on his way back to jail?
Read that he shot it out with the cops
Beat his ass until he dropped
Threw him in a cell, told him to rot
Who did he know and how did he get out?
Can he walk?  ‘Cause I heard he’s wheeling
Over drugs involving dealings
Shot ten times, do he have feelings?
Heard he’s violent, do he have feelings?
Got a girl?  Do he have feelings?
Life story so appealing
Not just us, OK, globe
Inquiring minds, they all want to know

[Hook: MF Grimm]
The world will help you climb ‘cause they
Love a superstar
Someone has to crash and burn, so they
Love a superstar, and, yes
I’m a superstar
Darling of PR, papa-
-razzi shoot from close and far
Even in private, no moments alone

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Upper West Side’s where he’s living
Will he end up like John Lennon?
Gunned down while with his woman?
For sin and unforgiven?
Sometime, people approach him
Touch trigger, should he toast ‘em?
A fan came to just praise him
“I love your music, I have all your songs”
Thank God he did not blaze him
That life just got him crazy
Shot it out with most those rappers
In streets, he’s even deeper
Living life now Day By Day
We need quotes, what will he say?
Name in lights thrown in mud, the
Carpet is red from celebrity blood

[Hook: MF Grimm]
The world will help you climb ‘cause they
Love a superstar
Someone has to crash and burn, so they
Love a superstar, and, yes
I’m a superstar
Darling of PR, papa-
-razzi shoot from close and far
Even in private, no moments alone

[Verse 3: MF Grimm]
He grew up while at war
Is he really six-foot-four?
They say he talk to angels
And safest while in danger
He has scars on his neck
‘Cause demons tried to strangle
Like spawn, came back from Hell
Sound like a movie, I think it would sell
He’s known as a Grand Master
Always an innovator
He seems so mad at America
Could he be in Al-Qaeda?
We hear he feel he’s greater
And really know his craft
I have one thing to ask you:
Can you please help me get his autograph?

The world will help you climb ‘cause they
Love a superstar
Someone has to crash and burn, so they
Love a superstar, and, yes
I’m a superstar
