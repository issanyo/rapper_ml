[Verse 1: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm) and Satan]
[Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Words lost, throat slit
Hearts beat hard, guns click
Pace slow down.  Clutch bloody sweater, pull
Trigger, heart stop beating all together
Soul like a feather, gravity pull no
Longer, now pulled by force stronger
Want to do things never done
Breath exhaled last one
What’s next to come?  Life’s sober, plain
Death is a high and it’s fucking with my brain
Thoughts insane, can’t take no more
Angels, demons, afterlife wars.  Try
To get my black ass back to the main floor
For real, it’s time to cut a deal, then the voice said:
[Satan]
How much should your legs move?

[Interlude 1: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Yo, who are you?

[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)] (x2)
I’m Dr. Death, motherfucker.  Ever heard of me?
Close your eyes, cross your fingers.  Time for surgery
I’m already dead, so, nah, you can’t murder me
‘Cause quantities of entities enter me evilly

[Verse 2: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm) and Satan]
[Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
The Devil’s playing games, flames
Illusions.  He make Hell seem
Better than Earth.  Lucifer?  What a
Salesman, put in your hand what you can’t touch
In Heaven, use you
Confuse you ‘til you forget all about
Hell’s true nature.  Think he loves ya?
He hates ya, even make you flip on the one who
Created ya, made ya
Satan, player-hating, said to me
So odd
[Satan]
Fuck you.  You’s
A teen I chose, you’re not a threat.  See, my
Beef’s with God.  Guy, you ain’t nothing
That’s what you live to do, that’s
The power that I’m giving to you, so
Do your job, put your finger on the trigger

[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)] (x2)
I’m Dr. Death, motherfucker.  Ever heard of me?
Close your eyes, cross your fingers.  Time for surgery
I’m already dead, so, nah, you can’t murder me
‘Cause quantities of entities enter me evilly

[Verse 3: Satan and Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
[Satan]
Kill your kind, destroy their minds.  I’ll own
Their soul.  Yes, I know deep down truly
God wants it back, but stick with me
I’ll let you rule Earth, for all it’s worth, and teach you
How to make it rain crack, flood cities
Blood money drip?  What a pity
[Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Road to Hell
Is paved with good intentions of ascension
Enhancing love for my brother Jansen
Wolves dance like Soul Train
Jay Black, I’ll bring pure pain.  Money still
On the motherfucking brain, cocaine cooking
Shit ain’t never gonna change.  Fuck it.  Toy
Soldiers act strange, war comes
Cowards scatter out of sniper range.  Sacrificed
His life for me, so fuck niggas
Icing me.  Heads cost a pretty penny and
A price to see—put that ass on layaway
Before I let you get away

[Interlude 2: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Yo, stop the record.  Who the fuck are you?  ‘Cause this shit is crazy, man.  Damn, this shit...

[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)] (x2)
I’m Dr. Death, motherfucker.  Ever heard of me?
Close your eyes, cross your fingers.  Time for surgery
I’m already dead, so, nah, you can’t murder me
‘Cause quantities of entities enter me evilly

[Outro]
“Incredible, isn’t it?  What the hell are they trying to do?  Wipe us all out or something?”
“Yeah, you’re right.  They’re kill our whole world off when they submerge the land and drown us all.  We'll vanish like Mu and Lemuria”
