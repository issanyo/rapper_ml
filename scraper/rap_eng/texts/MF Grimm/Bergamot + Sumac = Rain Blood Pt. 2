[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
I’m possessed by Huey P. Newton
Feds stress me out, then we’re shooting
Keep going, we’ll start it by elders
Take best shot, brain made of Kevlar
Got crown back, wear it like Babar
MF Grimm is Superstar
Jet Jaguar, my heroes kill cowboys
Go in trance and do rain dance
Beats drumming, summon ancestors
Help conquer all aggressors
Die for people is a pleasure
Satisfaction is beyond measure
Drop jewels so babies can treasure
Drop fools who rely on weak methods
Pimp they own—fuck what you stand for
Bling-bling, anything you fall for
Cha-ching, for the money, you sell out
Misleading the youth, get the hell out
They give you their money, you buy diamonds
You selfish bastard, I hope you die then
You need to feed your people
Born dead from American hunger
Kill more cowboys, I wonder
Go in trance and do rain dance

[Hook 1: MF Grimm]
For fallen comrades (Make it rain)
(Blood) For the brothers on lockdown (Make it rain)
(Blood) For the sisters who hold it down (Make it rain)
(Blood) Show we don’t fuck around (Make it rain)
(Blood) Die like a warrior (Make it rain)
(Blood) Uplift the people (Make it rain)
(Blood) The struggle continues (Make it rain)
(Blood) Rain blood (Rain blood), rain blood (Rain)

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Jet Jag stay at war, I hear gunshots
Robot override computer
Capable of stopping riots
But able to incite riots
Foresight be on fourth dimension
Microphone transform all tension
My heroes kill cowboys, I mention
Go in trance and do rain dance
We howl at moon in broad daylight
Wolves lost their mind, we don’t live right
No love, we kill off each other
We need to love each other
We are disappearing, my brothers
Through drugs and these guns, murder
Through pistols and prison, I’m awakened
Go in trance and do rain dance

[Hook 2: MF Grimm]
At those who oppress us (Make it rain)
(Blood) We are the people (Make it rain)
(Blood) Three-fifths a man—what?!? (Make it rain)
(Blood) Fuck being a slave (Make it rain)
(Blood) Rather be in my grave (Make it rain)
(Blood) Die like a warrior (Make it rain)
(Blood) Bust shots at the clouds (Make it rain)
(Blood) Rain blood (Rain blood), rain blood (Rain)

[Verse 3: MF Grimm]
Expose those flows, who’s really fakers
And dance on their ass ‘cause I’m a rainmaker
Jet Jaguar, spins cause whirlwinds
Godzilla kicking down buildings
Monstas on the Island are illing
Some clone us, end up like Gilligan
Take them all to war, I’m willing
MF is gone, peace to Megalon

[Hook 1: MF Grimm]
For fallen comrades (Make it rain)
(Blood) For the brothers on lockdown (Make it rain)
(Blood) For the sisters who hold it down (Make it rain)
(Blood) Show we don’t fuck around (Make it rain)
(Blood) Die like a warrior (Make it rain)
(Blood) Uplift the people (Make it rain)
(Blood) The struggle continues (Make it rain)
(Blood) Rain blood (Rain blood), rain blood (Rain)

[Outro: MF Grimm]
