[Verse]
Blow up, changed world we're living in
Tears drop from eyes like nitro glycerin
Time love no man we're all dated
Strive to be a success like those who did it
Brother passed away in my arms
I was shot up, still I remain calm
But died, came back to life
Grabbed the pen
I understand precious as oxygen
Soldiers put into work must be sabbath
Afraid to say my name
Like Dead Rabbits
Outcasted, bastards turned me savage
Revenge across my heart
I gotta have it
The spirit is in the room that's a sign
While others in the room are not kind
Save them, if only
I could rewind
Closure I can't find
Try to black it out my mind
The creator
I ask him why do you love me
Enter heaven
Why did you pick me
Right back on earth
Why did you stick me
You took my brother
Why did you trick me
You knew I loved him
Now i'm without him
It felt like he turned his back
I said fuck him
Word up, get this dough
Plot some murders
Enemies killed
But I don't feel no better
Wasn't raised to be this
Why am I bitter
Succumb to american hunger like a quitter
Haunt them, leap forward
Master quantum
The man my mother gave birth to, become him
The plan, make them all proud of me
Cause its not to late
Percey will be great
I respect the architect
Thankful for blessing
Hip hop is global
We leave impressions
People around the world ask me question
In america being black are you tested
Loved ones struggle, everydays a fight
I'll gladly trade my life to make it right
Death the ultimate sacrifice
My energy, become becon of light
Teach all the babies
Grave sight yes I promise
Emotional can't stop crying like Carl Thomas
The rain bring me pain every time
A bullet entered in my spine
I try to black it out my mind
It's wrong tortured on planet for so long
Different man still the same song
Huxtable's off the air
Blacks are trippin
Ashamed of the way we act
Cosby's flipping
I can't say he has no facts
How we living?
Guilty instead of building we destroying
Going for self
We're not even employing
Annoy, nothings left for girls and boys
And not alot of reason for them jump for joy
And i'd rather heal than to sit and spit poison
We have enough brothers and sister in prison
Sitting in the box and they're hot but frozen
Nailed to the cross MF was chosen
Forsaken, god sent me no signs
I try to black it out my mind
Still turning tap water to wine

[Outro]
Beyond your dimension I walk on ether

I don't even have a chorus, money
