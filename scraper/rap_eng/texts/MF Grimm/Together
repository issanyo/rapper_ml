MF Grimm - “Together”

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Story about a retarded nigga who went against his main nigga
Started rolling with other niggas, knew they wasn’t feeling niggas
Niggas had beef with niggas.  Now he breaking bread with niggas?
Jealousy and envy, money leave you dead, nigga
Clip in your head, throw you in the bathroom
Inside tub, chainsaw rub
Cut down to nubs, back like work
Thought he was the man, he was a motherfucking jerk.  From his
Face, wiped smirk, flipped the script, tried to lurk, but I’m
A gravedigger nigga, so I put him in the dirt.  At
First, the shit hurt, reminiscing when we laughed, having
Fun busting guns, but, yo, fuck it.  That’s the past
Had to kill his ass.  Loose cannon wanna scheme?  Free
Agent, over cream, switching teams?  Can’t let
It slide.  Time to take this ride.  Popped up
The trunk, throw him inside

[Hook: MF Grimm]
He
Flipped (Oh yes he did), he went to war against
His clique (Oh yes he did), and even though, to us
It did really hurt, still, we got together
And we tied him up (Oh yes we did).  He
Flipped (Oh yes he did), he went to war against
His clique (Oh yes he did), and even though, to us
It did really hurt, still, we got together
And we beat him up (Oh yes we did).  He
Flipped, he went to war against
His clique (Oh yes he did), and even though, to us
It did really hurt, still, we got together
And we chopped him up (Oh yes we did)

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Died on the trap like the rat he was
Before we blew his brains out, he screamed out, “Why?”
Didn’t tell him shit, let him find out
From his maker why he was aired out—fuck him!
Cobra Commander stripped the life
Metal Face laid laws, ain’t “No Snakes Alive”
Rakim said, “No mistakes allowed,” so we
Corrected him by dissecting him

[Hook: MF Grimm]
He
Flipped (Oh yes he did), he went to war against

And we tied him up (Oh yes we did).  He
Flipped (Oh yes he did), he went to war against

His clique (Oh yes he did), and even though, to us
