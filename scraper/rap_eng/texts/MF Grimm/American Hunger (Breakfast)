“Trapped in the belly of The Beast”
[MF Grimm]
Trying to get regurgitated ‘cause I am the feast

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
For hundreds of years and infinite tears, with
No remorse, they took us all to
War.  I was told, “You’re a sinner.  To become
A winner, then you must put faith in
The Lord.”  I do not choose to lead you
Astray, but, for me, bread don’t help no
More

[Bridge 1: MF Grimm]
Over here, we
Eat our young (American Hunger)
Vegetarians are
Bloodthirsty (American Hun-)
Oh no

“Trapped in the belly of The Beast”
[MF Grimm]
And it’s a fight to get released

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Damn, it’s hard being black in America
We’re under attack in America
In the belly, causing gas to America
Start shit, come out the ass of America
They don’t want us here, they
Hunt us here, lynch mobs kick in our
Doors.  They torture us as our
Women and our children watch in
Awe.  2008, not just
Black anymore, new objective: target
Poor, those who resist, raise up
A fist.  Yes, blood must be spilt on
Floor.  Down they gun us, over-
-run us, anything to have con-
-trol, and, on Judgment Day, when
All pay, may God have mercy on their
Souls.  In the media, we’re
Portrayed evil, constantly get
Dissed.  We’re not wanted here, an
Orphan raised just like Oliver
Twist.  You had rations.  You want
Lashings?  Leave.  You’re getting on my
Nerve.  Stomach growling, I’m still
Hungry.  May I please have some more
Sir?

[Bridge 2: MF Grimm]
Spoon-fed geno-
-cide they feed me (American Hunger)
Proper etiquette, they
Choose the needy (American Hun-)
Oh no

[MF Grimm]
And it’s a fight to get released

[Verse 3: MF Grimm]
I’m trying not to lose my mind
Financial concussions bruise my mind.  Kept
In dark, The Beast wanna crush me if I shine
Food for thought.  Starve, everything’s
Fine.  They’ll let you burn.  “When you gonna
Learn?  We don’t trust you, you’re a
Threat.”  They will make it look gang-
-related when they want to leave you
Wet.  Want us all to fall, they
Hate our guts, we don’t deserve to
Live.  Drain us of our souls
Hearts are cold, we have no more to
Give.  Misery really loves
Company, we’re living under
Stress.  These animals are can-
-nibals, drink my blood and eat my
Flesh

[Bridge 3: MF Grimm]
They stole me.  Now a
Slave, they sold me (American Hunger)
Serpent lurking, victims
Swallowed whole (American Hun-)
Oh no
