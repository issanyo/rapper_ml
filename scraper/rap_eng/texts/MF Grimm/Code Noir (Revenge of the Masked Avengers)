[Producer(s): Hans Solo]

[Intro: Hans Solo]
Rocking with Hans Solo, ya know?  Rocking with Hans Solo, ya know?

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Can’t take it no more
Broke in the window with some kerosene and some
Matches, creeping quiet, silent
Riot, mask, and then I just
Snuck in the room
As he slept, I poured it all over the evil
Bastard, strike the match, I lit
Him up, I held him down
Inhaling the fumes
We’re choking from all the smoke in the house, but I’m
Laughing hard.  He fears
Dying, so he’s crying, yeah
Proving a point
Burning this house to the ground, yes, I’m killing my
Master, release of tension, find
Redemption, slave rebellion, yell

[Hook: MF Grimm]
This ain’t no life here
Can’t take no more
This ain’t no life here
Can’t take no more

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Slaves in the field
They dance around from the joy ‘cause they see all the
Flames, steps are tribal, greet
Survival, defeat our rivals, yes
House niggas are shields
Some got the color but they are not brothers, they’re
Traitors, sell you out to live in the
House, at you they’re shouting, “No”
Their fate is sealed
Try to defend master’s property, then we’re
Gonna kill you off because
You’re soft and we don’t need your kind
Weakness revealed (Masked Avengers)
Challenge us, you will see we will be the
Winner.  Fuck history, no
Mystery, this victory’s ours
Proving a point
Burning this house to the ground, yes, killing my
Master
Proving a point
Burning this house to the ground, yes, killing my
Master
Proving a point
Burning this house to the ground, yes, killing my
Master
