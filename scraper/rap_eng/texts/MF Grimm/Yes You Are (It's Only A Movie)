...must know
You are my true
Love, Mary.  Yes
You are.  Mary Magdalene’s on my mind

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
While the world laughed, you stood by me
Others ran.  You chose not to flee.  You got
Hell on Earth for loving me, nothing
Scared you away, by my side you stayed
To my Father above, you prayed and prayed
To switch places with me when I was slayed
‘Cause girl, I could feel it, and my wounds, you would heal ‘em
But it’s out your hands, these sins of man
Some tried to judge you, picking up stones
Shattered furniture and glass-made homes
Jealous people throw ‘em, they ricochet
Bobbing and weaving as they come their way
As my world burns, the flames you bear
You were still there when all the smoke cleared
And, girl, I could see it in your eyes, I did
As your tears fall, I would catch them all
No hatred in your heart.  Forgive them please
I feel no pain, my soul’s at ease
No questions.  God made his choice
But always in your mind will be my voice ‘cause

[Hook: MF Grimm] (x4)
You must know
You are my true
Love, Mary.  Yes
You are.  Mary Magdalene’s on my mind
