MF Grimm - “Yes or No”
[Emcee(s): MF Grimm]
[Producer(s): Craig Rip]

[Hook: MF Grimm and (Sample)]
(Is it yes?) March forward if you feel that you’re blessed
(Is it no?) Step back if you don’t want to go.  I
Lead the way.  Follow me and I promise you
Will live forever, all soldiers of fortune
Down payment might be death, our blood it is costing

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
I lead by example in this war with my sword
So if our blood is shed, it’s mine before yours
But if there’s bloodshed, I’m the first one to spill it
The battlefield’s a graveyard, God’s gonna fill it
Keep your eye on the prize.  We rise up for glory
Those who survive go back, tell the story
If I fall in battle, please tell mine for me
And let them all know you were last one who saw me
Let the people know that I died like a leader
I lived the same way, so everything is even
If it cost me my life, then I spent it on freedom

[Hook: MF Grimm and (Sample)]
(Is it yes?) March forward if you feel that you’re blessed
(Is it no?) Retreat if you don’t want to go.  I
Lead the way.  Follow me and you will
Live forever, all soldiers of fortune
Down payment might be death, our blood it is costing
(Is it yes?) March forward if you feel that you’re blessed
(Is it no?) Step back if you don’t want to go.  I
Lead the way.  Follow me and you will
Live forever, all soldiers of fortune
Down payment might be death, our blood it is costing
So kill with stronger will, send enemies the bill

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
On the road to riches, speed bumps are worth a mill
Potholes and ditches might get soldiers killed
Roadblocks, obstacles, get hard to steer
Optical illusions of gold ain’t real
Prayers for the roadkill that got a raw deal
Slayed on the battlefield, slow swinging steel
Chest wide open, so fate now sealed
Scars and memories, awkwardly they heal
We take their territory, make ‘em all hail
Shake ‘em from their cloud in Heaven, give ‘em all Hell
Break ‘em off a little something, crush ‘em on the whole

(Is it yes?) March forward if you feel that you’re blessed
(Is it no?) Step back if you don’t want to go.  I
Lead the way.  Follow me and you will
Live forever, all soldiers of fortune
Down payment might be death, our blood it is costing
In the game of war, both sides will suffer losses

[Verse 3: MF Grimm]
Chariots will be seized, stolen will be horses
Burn down houses, men killed in front of spouses
Many died crucified, but there were no crosses
Spilling blood and guts making soldiers nauseous
Always keep composure.  When in doubt, be cautious
Followed instructions, won’t face destruction
Faith in our Creator, that’s our protection
March to victory, forward is direction
Maintain campaign, murderous selection
In the Valley of Death, so many now are resting
History will be made, so I ask you a question:
