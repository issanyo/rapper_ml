[Verse 1: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
They tortured all my
Ancestors, (hung them by the neck).  They sit back and they
Laugh at us, (race with no respect).  We helped build this
Whole country (brick by brick).  They don’t treat us like
Human beings, (animals that’s sick).  It’s not water that’s
Making mud, (the flowers are crying).  The soil saturates with
Our blood, (brother and sisters are dying).  Forty acres
And a mule, (land was promised).  Forty lashes
Whipped so cruel, (Kunta Kinte is astonished).  For so long
We slaved this earth, but when time to get
What’s deserved, (you didn’t read the fine print).  They say, “Forget what we
Said before.  (Nothing’s written in stone).  We don’t need your kind
No more.  (This is not your home)”

[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Go back to
Africa.  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa”

[Verse 2: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
It’s hard to understand
The men (What make ‘em tick?) who sin ‘cause they
Hate my skin (To bear the burden we were picked).  A white rose is
What is chose (Law of the land).  A red one is
Still a rose (The Creator made them both).  In our yards, they
Burn a cross (Live at the barbecue), saying, “Nigga
You get lost (Next time, it’ll be you).  Pack your stuff, be
Out of here (We don’t want you here building).  Where you go, we
Just don’t care (Just take them nappy-headed children).  Matter of fact, we
Take that back (Our words we devour).  You should go where
It’s all black (‘cause, here, you have no power).  You don’t deserve
Privileges (We don’t think that you’re a man).  You’re nothing but
Savages (How can I make you understand?!?)  Nigga!”

[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)] (x2)
Go back to
Africa.  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa.”  They say, “Go back to
Africa”
