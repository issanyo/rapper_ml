[Bridge (Overlapped with Intro): Sample from the Artifacts - “C’mon Wit Da Git Down”]
Get down
Get down
Get down
Get down
Get down
Get down

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Days of Alizé
Nights of Cristal, champagne corks
Bust like they’re pistols.  Feeling good
Sit back, wine, dine, watch the diamonds
Glitter, gold shine, expensive
Games we play, mad shout-outs
Coming from the DJ.  Some come as
Couples and others single.  DJ scratch it in
Everybody jingles.  A lot of players
Party, game’s tight, but jealous motherfuckers
Only come to start fights.  You’s a bigger nigga
Ignore it.  They’re broke
Mad at you for it.  Eye on bottle
Really wanna pour it, throat so dry
Player-haters don’t know why
They could play too if they really tried
There’s enough for everyone to have a slice of pie.  To
The bar, more drinks we buy.  (How we live?) We live
The good life ‘til the day we die

[Hook: Ekim] (x2)
Everybody on the
Floor, throw your hands up!
And wave ‘em like you just don’t care in the air!
Keep ‘em up!  Come on, keep ‘em up!
On the floor!  That’s right!

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
My crew’s representing jiddy, exotic women
Perfume, dress pretty.  See the DJ
He got the music flowing, party over here
Soul Train line going, have no fear
Ladies hypnotize with booties on the low
Players slide with cuties, dress spandex
So you know the ass out.  Niggas sweaty
Drunk, about to pass out, but fuck that
Hear your favorite song, to the floor, stagger back with a
Slight diddy bop though, stepping like the mack
Bitches roll in packs, eyes on money stacks
All dime pieces, none seemed wack
Soul come through speakers as sound.  Can you
Feel it?  Yeah, feel the love all around, everybody

[Hook: Ekim] (x2)
Everybody on the
Floor, throw your hands up!
And wave ‘em like you just don’t care in the air!
Keep ‘em up!  Come on, keep ‘em up!
On the floor!  That’s right!

[Verse 3: MF Grimm]
Look
You come in here to have fun, don’t act up
No wins, you’re out-gunned a thousand to one
Represent Monsta Island, shine like the Sun, parties
Rocked straight from start, continue, never done
Five families unite, become one
Invisible on map, the world we run
Accumulate the papers, nonbelievers left stunned

[Hook: Ekim] (x2)
Everybody on the
Floor, throw your hands up!
And wave ‘em like you just don’t care in the air!
Keep ‘em up!  Come on, keep ‘em up!
On the floor!  That’s right!
