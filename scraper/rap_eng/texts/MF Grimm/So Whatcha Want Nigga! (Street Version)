So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?

[Verse 1: The Grimm Reaper (AKA MF Grimm)]
I make more noise than a chainsaw, insane
Pain caused, then drained just to give your brain more
I’ll write rhymes with no strain, wet rappers like
Rain, bust caps like John Wayne, Shaft, or Shane
To build a name, you came to battle me
Get crushed like a candy cane or cancelled like Fame (What?!?)
Always maintain, I elevate game.  Grimm
Use all styles like Sonny Chiba use crane
A drunken monk on a punk, and leave his ribs
Sunk in.  From giving fights, hearts get shrunken
Vocals never shitty, just clean, an instrumental
Idi Amin.  You limp out, I’ll rip out your spleen
Mind tricks like a Jedi, my right eye’s
A deadeye.  Fuck a drive-by—do walk-bys or fly-bys
To the cops, I’m the roughest.  I’ll put on
Starsky, and Hutch is on motherfucking crutches (Whoo-wee!)
Put to sleep like a stray.  I’m so fly
I’ll pull your girl in a Cavalier and Santa Claus
Sleigh.  No sucker could serve me.  I’ll have ‘em running
Circles like a horse in the fucking Kentucky Derby
Competition I’m bagging ‘cause niggas try to
Preach and teach, but full of shit like Jimmy Swaggart (Yeah!)
Fuck him up, give the nigga more.  His ass is mine
Greg Valentine, I’ll throw him in the figure four
Nothing to lose and all to gain.  My mother thought she’s
Raising Arizona, but she end up Raising fucking Cain (Word!)
There’s not too many flyer ‘cause I’m cute
But, at the same time, a 5’9” Michael Myers
I’m about to make dough, and niggas hate it
I keep my gun at my hip band, this shit is nickel-plated
Half my life, I’ve been called a loser
A bully, a bruiser, but now I’m making payments on
My Land Cruiser

So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?  So what you
Want, nigga?

[Verse 2: The Grimm Reaper (AKA MF Grimm)]
I’m tapping niggas’ jaws like a phone.  I don’t care
I don’t have it all there upstairs, I’m not
Home.  The Reaper gets real mean.  I’ll rip
A show like a fat bitch who rip a pair of tight jeans
Take no jocks, so trying to get locked?  No
My beeper so fly, niggas think I’m 5-0
Niggas down with us frowning us.  When me and
Raida turn our backs, they snatch all our fucking tracks
Niggas try to uplift but then they linger
The only thing I’m lifting is my middle motherfucking finger
“If you’re a gangster, then what are you doing in hip hop?”  I’m trying
To make ends meet and not die in the fucking streets
Niggas come out talking “fuck the police” and make
A few dollars.  Now they rap about fucking peace
My job is to break necks.  I’m not
Jumping on the bandwagon trying to sound like Das EFX
Lost will to live and going insane, my brain’s
In pain.  I need therapy but it’s not free
Rappers run around in a rampage in a video
But look scared as shit when they’re on stage
Life get snuffed out—how fast it passes
TEC-9 blast took care of their cocky asses
Too many Rocky movie or karate classes
Try to get sassy, I’ll break your arm like it’s taffy
Death, all die together, I spray once
Grimm taunts and haunts, spooking niggas like a séance
Battle anybody and take ‘em quick.  Fuck
The world, and all of you can suck my dick!
