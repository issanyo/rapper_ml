Life be fooling me, society is screwing me
It's entrapment so I see no future days
But the dead is schooling me, my thoughts are jewelry
So hopefully longevity my creativity is appraised
Everytime I flow, whether fast or slow
I illustrate and complicate like paintings from Van Gogh
I cock my brain back like a TEC-9
I bust rhymes off, I let my mind shine
Intellect orbits morbid, rhymes antifinite
Scrabble minds like Milton Bradley everytime that I write
You're matter, I'm space, matter in space is weightless
Scatter when chased, duck motherfucker or be faceless
Verbal gangbanger, world changer, black Jesus
The bacon ripped to pieces with my murder thesis
Paralyzed I kick ass, telekinesis
That's physical communication through terror brain sensation
Sometime I feel like death is getting closer
The streets is so cold but hot like a toaster
The electric chair is here, yo Como try to stop it
But that punk ass nigga Pataki put the plug back in the socket

Push the red button, light the match
Blow this motherfucking world up and let's start from scratch
When World War 3 come, it's time to leave
Omega rewind back to Adam and Eve

No bygones are bygones, streets turn to Saigon
I'm capping 'em before they take me out
That shit ain't happening
FCC, break the codes that I'm rapping in
Phones tapping in, cameras in the crib are mapping in
Fuck the Klan or any man who hide behind politics and bibles
To stop me from survival
No longer do I contribute to genocide like I did
I chop trees; I plant seeds for the kids
But when this war come I'm flipping wigs
Power to the people, fuck these evil pigs
So burn to ashes, in God we trust
I turn the wild to a pile of dust
And I halt rotation, world stop turning
Mind missiles, Earth starts burning
Bone gristle, traces behind
One more time, erase mankind
Create from dust, trust insight
Unlock darkness, shed light
Beam touch soil, heat magnification
Volcanoes boil, next step vegetation
Reproduction, subtract clouds of gloom
Beauty born through destruction and doom
MF Ebola, quarantine the vocal room
Locals die soon, once inhale my deadly tomes
I'm killing billions to make room for me to get up
Then I raise the dead up, I speak for those that's fed up
But won't let up, crucifix, birds picking at me
Tapes seized like I'm Nixon see
Rikki Tikki Tavi, snakes hissing at me
Life's a bitch, bitches blowing kisses at me
Niggas get jealous, get the guns spitting at me
And to God I pray, but oh the shit he say
You wouldn't believe it in a million years (No)
You'll be horrified, crucified, stoned by peers
As the lynch mob cheers
