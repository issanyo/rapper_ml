[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Tossing
Turning, dreams of murder.  Someone’s killing me
It changes—that’s nice—I’m on a killing spree
All done, cold blood, waking up to cold sweats
This is such a cold world, my conscience getting death threats
Shadows choking me, my last breath
Lets out my body.  It’s a conspiracy
My mind and my body’s not really down with me
Me against the whole world, it’s a little deeper
Me against myself, I fight the Grimm Reaper
Swing sickle, I got my Glock busting rounds off
Demented, schizophrenic.  I know this sounds off
To you.  I do not lie.  When I doze off
Spirits hope I die.  Whatever
Angels waste their time, they work together
Scheme and plot on me ‘cause I’m son of man
I hear voices from a dog like Son of Sam
Don’t give a damn if the bullets fill me
I don’t wanna live, I hope they kill me
Put me out my misery.  I’m living misery
I kill all my enemies ‘cause I love company
Those who seek me are called wise men
Or either wise guys.  I pray you comprehend
And realize I’m condemned

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
No
Rest, homicidal dreams.  My cell
Mate, all he do is scream out
Loud how he wants to go home.  That’s
Funny.  I’m here all alone
Locked in a single cell.  His back’s
Bleeding, he’s cold as hell
And I’m hoping they turn on some heat
I called the C.O. to bring some extra sheets.  Where’d he go?
He walk through walls, run halls—I pray he teach me
They don’t see your mental health, try to reach me
I said, “Please see how he feels.”  They said
“He’s alright, but he’s not real”
Evaluation say I suffer from depression
Hallucination, self-creations what they’re guessing
I’m here, doing years, I’m stressing
Medicate me, state me want me to rest in
Don’t take it ‘cause he said that won’t be bested
He said I need his help and he needs me
Nigga, you walk through walls.  Go home, you’re free

[Verse 3: MF Grimm]
Home?  That was far, and he was turnt off
‘Cause his wings was burnt off
A lesson was learned, communicated with one
I was chosen ‘cause I’m God’s son

[Outro: MF DOOM]
And I’m the retarded one!
