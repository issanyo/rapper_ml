[Verse 1]
Used to hate here, wanted to leave here
Couldn't see this far, surprised to be here
Ball drops again, seen another year
I'm thankful for my live cause you coulda took it
Learn the difference between life and death
What separates the two is one breath
Take a deep one before you exhale
I'm thankful for my live cause you coulda took it
Came to shoot me, execute me
Persecute me, Percy must die
Take me to you, but you stopped it
You saved my life because you know they coulda took it
Instruments of death always prevailed
Whether a gun, knife, or harsh words
I mimic the songs of the caged bird
To me this is way beyond a simple rhyme
Way beyond a simply rhyme

[Verse 2]
I'm a rich man because I'm blessed
Escape purgatory that was one test
The hate that burned in me must rest
I'm thankful for my live cause you coulda took it
Life is painful, I'm an expert
Tears were digital, prison did hurt
People missed message, hated artwork
I'm thankful for my live cause you coulda took it
Fighting CO's, I get beat down
Take my chair, make me crawl around
Couldn't break me, how you like me now?
You saved my life because you know they coulda took it
Let me rise up, let my wings flap
I fell to Earth once the guns clapped
Learned my lesson, let me come back
To me this is way beyond a simple rhyme
Way beyond a simply rhyme

[Verse 3]
Over matter, focus my mind
Darkness cloaks me, shadow my spine
On my face, I feel the sunshine
I'm thankful for my live cause you coulda took it
Day by day I wrestle with thoughts
Thinking of street wars that we fought
So many died in our blood sport
I'm thankful for my live cause you coulda took it
Please forgive me for trading places
Becoming a murderer not leaving traces
Found innocent, beating cases
You blessed me even though that life you knew I took it
Scars and memories, how much can I take?
Demons choke me in my dream state
I don't sleep, for days I stay awake
To me this is way beyond a simple rhyme
Way beyond a simply rhyme
