[Intro: Sample]
“Eyes with TV cameras.  Also, it has automatic evasion devices, so it'll always get out of your way”
“Hahaha, hope so”
“But as far as I’m concerned, it's got right of way”
“Hahaha”

[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
We had a
Fortune
For all my peers, like a robot, I cry
Digital tears
We did not know no better
We thought we'd live forever
And all the women loved us
And bullets did not touch us
Oh no, we had a
Fortune
For all my peers, like a robot, I cry
Digital tears
It can happen to you
To all you nonbelievers
Just pick up the magazine
Fell in the Don Diva

[Verse 1: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Machiavelli said you’d better treat fortune like it's your woman
Don't abuse her—if you do, there's nothing like a woman scorned.  She'll
Pull you down like gravity, break you up, though mentally
Sleep with your friends, those you don't know, and also enemies
Anyone to incite jealously, make you wish you had her
It doesn't matter.  She'll crush your dreams—as you sleep, they shatter
So you gotta be strong, man, ‘cause sometimes shit go wrong, man
Your money just ain’t long, man, like it was before
Retreat—no shame in it, soldier, the art of war
Regroup—God gave you talent, so use your brain
Maintain, get back on comfortable terrain
Rebuild legit, you don’t have to sell cocaine or
Heroin.  Many have done it, but now they're gone.  I’ll speak
Of dons, kings of the street but died as pawns.  For what?
Most dead, crippled now, locked down for twenty-three in a cell
Miserable as hell ‘cause we destroyed our families chasing
Fortune.  She know how to pimp a pimp—it's simple
Convince him to write his name in lights on side of blimps
We sold drugs, caught bodies, laid ‘em down with guns
Secret indictments, life sentences, government know everything we done.  Now
Only I will get to feel the Sun, never again we feel the Moon
Fighting inside, try to free our minds, try to break out this cocoon
It's contradictory ‘cause we're all slaves, our soul is on ice.  Still
We burn in the fire and desire paradise
We’re only human, we made mistakes, no one on the planet's perfect
But analyze the situation—that shit was not worth it
We lost time, lost our minds, even lost our girls
Reminiscing, sitting in jail, thinking about days sitting on top of the world

[Verse 2: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Never break the code, don't run your mouth, never name names, never tell dames
Your business, watch who you call a friend ‘cause, in back, shoot you in the end
Testify, say you the one, the mastermind, kingpin
You pulled triggers, arranged hits, distributed bricks, did all this shit
Feds seize cars, keys, house, jewelry, freeze accounts
These amounts get used against ya.  On defense, your lawyer's tense
He states, “Repent, just take the plea
Escape death penalty.”  Get L-I-F-E chasing
Fortune.  She know how to pimp a pimp—it's simple
Convince him to write his name in lights on side of blimps.  Even
Clowns bloodthirsty in this carnival of carnivores
Con the sacred.  Scars & Memoirs, past wars, Feds
Watch and know everything about our covert culture, so I asked
“Is it beneficial or possible to play dead for a hawking vulture?”  Negative
Bluff all you want.  Ahead of the game, the vulture eats ya.  Irrelevant
You're easy prey, so either way, the vulture beats ya.  Ring-
-master is the Feds in this carnival of carnivores
Let you think you're someone, but then crack the whip.  Jump the weeping fire
Or the high-wire.  You're going haywire.  They say, “Hey, nigga, you's a liar
So cooperate with the United States of America and just wear this wire”
No shade.  Demands made, you got played, Uncle Sam tied
Both hands together behind your back, told you, “Juggle these hand grenades.”  You had it
All.  “You was a baller—that's the price to pay,” and in
Your head it stays
