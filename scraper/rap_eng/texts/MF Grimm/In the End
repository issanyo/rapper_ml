“Broke the hell out” - Slick Rick on Doug E. Fresh & The Get Fresh Crew ft. Slick Rick - “La Di Da Di”

[Verse 1: Yves St. Larock]
My rap lines immobilize wise guys, pressure’s
Applied on every rhyme, evil thoughts unwind.  See, my
Data scatters, removing these rappers that chitter-chatter
Verbs shatter your matter, flow is painful to an amateur
Mr. Spectacular bubbling like lavender
Doing numbers to characters and tossing ‘em to scavengers
I got what it takes ‘cause I devour rappers properly
Mentality’s deep, so why pursue and try to copy me?
‘Cause their rhymes are flatlined.  Flow is a threat to all
Mankind.  Follow my scent just like a canine
The fragrance you embrace is laced with a raw taste
Manhattan my birthplace, I’ll work at a smooth pace

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Representing criminals mixing minerals
Arsenal invincible, buying emeralds
Touch untouchable, Klingon cloak invisible
Galaxy to galaxy, slay extraterrestrials
Revolution equal change, spiritual industrial
It would be cool if we could live like the Huxtables
Break pain down all the way to the decimal
Not testable, get beat to death with words I decibel
Words congressional, it’s professional.  Devour
Me?  Some try, die thinking I’m digestible
But cyanide is not digestible.  Little
Kid, drink your milk and eat your vegetables
Stop storytelling like Aaron Spelling
Fronting like villains, accumulating millions
Lies of the century, they take off
Then leave the planet, burn to ashes on reentry
When, in reality
Niggas never should have...

[Verse 3: Yves St. Larock]
I’m blowing out your eardrums like afros and then some
Inferior to no one, respected like a shogun
Analyze my verse that I’ve designed between the lines and I’m
Sure you’ll find the thoughts that I’ve gathered are genuine
I’m top choice, my flow’s moist—never could I be dry
I show enough supply to blow the whole sea sky-high
Like Oklahoma, straight-up, kiddo, as if I’m sober
Control you like a Hindu with the flow, possessing cobras, see?
I’ll make my picture clear, vivid, and graphic
These rhymes that I’ve crafted leave timid rappers plastered
The microphone specialist explosive like a terrorist
If my rhymes are garments, then you’ll all be wearing this

[Verse 4: MF Grimm]
We’re scuffing
Brains like sneakers, vocals shake speakers
Eyes dilate, hearts vibrate like beepers
In the studio, Big Yves, Grimm Reaper
Show Mad Flows, then go a little deeper
Periodically, idiotically, niggas rise
Gigantically, gasp frantically, sink
Titantically, funny dudes or antics, B
Of a rapper fronting.  Family plots, Melendez
Hunt after me savagely with one incentive
Energy be all comprehension, brought back, walking mentally
Brain shield, nigga, forcefield, no one enters me
The Fourth Dimension is the entity
Activate the sixth sense and just follow me
Where success is truly in the mind, vibrations from
The brain and the heart, they intertwine
Jay Black push buttons from afar
Scrub my brain with Armor All and shine like a star
Memories and scars, mad jewels and cars
Be up to par stepping to the Monsta Island Czars
Nigga
