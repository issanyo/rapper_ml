It gotta be slowed down if it gon bang in my ride

Grey tape in the deck, grey tape in the deck, grey tape in the deck

Slow, slow down if it, bang, bang in my ride
Raised, raised in the tex and I rep it with pride
Grey tape in the deck, grey tape in the deck, grey tape in the deck of slab at all time

Verse 1: CeaseMusic ..

Is lean with styraphome
And I don't know
Weither you hate me
Or you dout me
Cause last time I check

From cliff to the grove
Im born out in mesquite
A Country boy never alone
I remeber growing up
Girls would laugh and even shrug
Cause a boy was really young
Trinna a couple bucks
Now you hear me on cds
And you see me doing shows
Trinna holla at a playa
Just leave me alone

5 hits a couple plays
& girls done even broke my heart
Yea Pray in dark
Slow musics all I bang

Till I'm Laying My Grave
One Deep Till End
Hata Proof Is My Lable
And My Money Is My Friend
