[Sample (Melody): The Emotions - “I Could Never Be Happy” (0:00 and 0:42)]

[Hook 1: Sample from The Emotions - “I Could Never Be Happy”] (x2)
You’re my life
When shadows fall
You’re my hope
When faith is lost

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Heaven sent a gift from above
To teach me love while I dwell down below
Trapped in darkness.  Light?  You spark this
Nothing else matters, you are everything
Angels love you, for you they sing
Money here is king, the spiritual war
Temptations, I’m greedy for more
But, girl, it’s you that I adore, so
I wait for my time to come, gotta play it cool
Make proper moves, get my ass back in school
The world is cruel, hard heads stray
Run in streets, think shit’s okay
Said a lot of things, made mistakes on the way
Shit do change, crime don’t pay
You make me want to do right, understand?
The love you share make me a better man

[Hook 2: MF Grimm] (x2)
You’re a gift from above
While I dwell down low
For you, I’ll do anything
Because you mean everything

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
When it come to lips, yours are delicious
When it come to love, you’re the definition
Life is rough, sometime we hit walls
With you at my side, I’ll get through it all
Taught me how to control inner demons
Transform this Hell, turn it into Heaven
You make my whole world so much fun
I’m so glad that we are one
When I saw you, I was afraid to meet you
When I met you, I was afraid to kiss you
When I kissed you, I was afraid to love you
Now that I love you, I’m afraid to lose you
This is to the death, girl.  I will never leave you
Loyal to you, I won’t deceive you
Cherish you, give my life for you
Better yet, learn to live for you
What the world has to offer, bring it to you
My child, when it come, bring it through you
You put a spell on me, it’s like voodoo
‘Cause no one can do what you do
Look into your eyes, it was love at first sight
Total opposites, but so much alike
We were made for each other—that’s clear
You’re the reason I’m still here

[Hook 2: MF Grimm] (x2)
You’re a gift from above
While I dwell down low
For you, I’ll do anything
Because you mean everything

[Hook 1: Sample from The Emotions - “I Could Never Be Happy”] (x2)
You’re my life
When shadows fall
You’re my hope
When faith is lost
