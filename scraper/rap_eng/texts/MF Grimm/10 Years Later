[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
10 years later
I’m blessed and still breathing
But I gotta tell you, Jay, things are not greater
As you know, many more lives were terminated
So even more scars accumulated
Memories engraved deep, not faded
Death came, passed, no Sunday shaded
But I know without you, Jay, I’d have never made it
10 years later

[Hook: MF Grimm]
Thinking about you, brother, all the time (And I be)
Talking to you most of my rhymes
Things are not better, Jay.  Feel me?
More scars, more memories (And I be)
Hoping that the babies don’t suffer (And I be)
Tell ‘em that, “An MF love ya” (Love ya)
Clutched in the hands of poverty
More scars, more memories (Memories)

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Traveled through the years, jealousy
Became a cancer to the family
Quest for money divided us
Feels like they forgot you died for us
Feels like God just lied to us
Life on Earth is death to us
Not saying I can’t be wrong
Just saying, about this, I feel strong

[Hook (Overlapped with Interlude): MF Grimm] (x3)
Thinking about you, brother, all the time (And I be)
Talking to you most of my rhymes
Things are not better, Jay.  Feel me?
More scars, more memories (And I be)
Hoping that the babies don’t suffer (And I be)
Tell ‘em that, “An MF love ya” (Love ya)
Clutched in the hands of poverty
More scars, more memories (Memories)

[Interlude (Overlapped with Hook): MF Grimm]
To the mighty Subroc, Big L, T., K-Nitt.  10 years later.  Yves St. Larock, KK, and to all the other ones who left this Earth too soon.  Rest in peace.  K-Nitt, Subroc, Yves St. Larock, Big L.  Rest in peace.  And to all others who left this Earth too soon

[Outro: Fatman Scoop]
Let me just calm down, get myself together.  Like I told you, I don’t just endorse anything.  I don’t just walk into a studio and say, “This is hot,” or put my name or put my image on something just because.  I’m telling you this man is hot.  I’ve known this man for many years, aight?  Taking it back to the X-Ecutioner days, when Roc Raida was his DJ and he was getting down in the streets, he has continued on and done his thing, and this is the culmination of all that right here: Special Herbs + Spices Volume One
