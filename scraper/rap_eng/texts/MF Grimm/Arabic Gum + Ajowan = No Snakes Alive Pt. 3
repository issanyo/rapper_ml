MF DOOM & MF Grimm - “Arabic Gum + Ajowan = No Snakes Alive Pt. 3”
[Emcee(s): MF Grimm]
[Producer(s): MF DOOM (Original Instrumental from Metal Fingers - “Star Anis”)]

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Locked down, learned law, represented pro se
Got released, mental beast did become Percy
Open gates, let me out.  Mach speed, return to Monsta
Island, summon all monsters, spit fire
World burning.  Purgatory, many moons, many men
Many made it out, and many go again
Many ways to make money in the streets, so many come
Many die young ‘cause the ghetto’s many guns
Harlem days, Harlem nights, path of money making
Harlem death, Harlem life, some get taken
Harlem world at war, bullets hit, you’re aching
Body at Harlem hospital, in surgery, Harlem shaking
Better way?  Gotta be.  Day By Day, try to see
Focus on future, meditate on positivity
I’m immortal, you could never kill me.  My voice
Echo for eternity, threats don’t concern me
Now know true power
Is within, radiate to the people
Pure focus, no hocus pocus
Superstar Jet Jag, showbiz
So you know this, now I slow down
‘Cause I realize I’m speeding, and I give a
Moment of silence for the brothers who no longer here

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
I love you all!
‘Til we meet again, my weapon is the pen
Same agenda, no snakes alive in the end
No breaks this time for fake-ass friends
Left dead-bent, decipher what is meant
Question for the hip hop mass:
Who will grab a mic and wax an emcee’s ass?
Who could be three years behind and fly fast?
Jet Jag blast past where others catch crash
Music Platos predicted Percy, planet’s Pluto
Problem: king pissed, one head on the platter
Pest, Percy preach power to the people
Yes, punish him, place him in prison
Provoke him, play him, take away his privileges
Planet of the Apes, Caesar educate the savages
Settings starve him, reduce daily ration
Strip search, shake cells, see for shanks stashing
Swallowed by a system of six-day sores
Who hypnotize society?
Even though suffer slow, I
Still saddled my sanity.  Most
Think it’s cool to kill kin and go to
Correctional facilities for eternity
It must stop!

[Outro: MF Grimm]
Free Mumia  (That’s right) Free Mumia.  I didn’t come here to make friends, motherfuckers.  I came here to piss niggas off.  That’s right.  What?!?  It’s working.  That’s right.  That’s right.  Let’s get this shit going.  (Killer mongoose) Manhattan, (The killer mongoose) New York.  Jet Jaguar a killer mongoose.  No snakes alive.  Once again.  (Crushing heads) Keep breeding ‘em, keep killing ‘em.  MF DOOM, MF Grimm.  J. Marty, what up?
