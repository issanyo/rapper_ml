[Hook 1: MF Grimm]
Niggas truly hate me, haven’t seen me lately, can’t escape
Fate, destiny has dates.  Come one, come
All, follow
Me to your death
People want to kill me, but they’re looking silly.  Really, I’m worth
Millions, your blood just spilling.  Come one, come
All, follow
Me to your death

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Shady individuals, they
Dream about just killing you
Gentlemen. pick your poison with pipe dreams or
Bullets—now they’re filling you
Academy awards, best support
Niggas act so cool with you, but
Hatred runs so deep in hearts and
Veins, they fooled theyself plus you
Extinguish your life, obtain radiation
Transformation, life they take.  Not
All contracts are written—some are
Verbal with a firm handshake.  Blinded
By unconditional love, you don’t
See what they’re ‘bout to do to you, but
Mutiny is upon your ship, but
Still, they seem like crew to you

[Hook 1 (Overlapped with Hook 2): MF Grimm]

Millions, your blood just spilling.  Come one, come
All, follow
Me to your death

[Hook 2 (Overlapped with Hook 1): MF Grimm]
I’ve seen them rise and fall
I’ve seen them rise and fall
Come one, come one, come all
Come one, come one, come all

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Crew go down with sinking ship, but
Some seem real quick to abandon
Socialize with them other guys.  Then
How the fuck you my man then?  What
Changed?  Loyalty was everything
I just don’t understand.  If
You are, then give me a hand.  Then
I am all alone, I’m running out of
Ammo, surrounded by the enemy
Fucking with this witchcraft, I
Hear niggas are laughing at me
But it sounds just like bitch laughs.  Set me up
May God forgive your soul
From crime scene, I watch you flee.  Fool
Me once, it’s shame on you.  Fool me
Twice, then it is shame on me.  We’ll
See at the end of this bloodbath
Who will get the last laugh, nigga
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

I’ve seen them rise and fall
I’ve seen them rise and fall
Come one, come one, come all
Come one, come one, come all
