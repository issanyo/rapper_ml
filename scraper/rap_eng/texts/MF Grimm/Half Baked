Snatch Baby Ruth, for money I had to take her
Slim Jim stepped in, caught a Jawbreaker
Like peanut brittle, sent Baby in bits
Offer made, Juicy Fruit don't want a Doublemint
Jack was a cracker, killed Cracker Jack
Didn't like my skin, gingerbread, and that's a fact
Double murder killed Mike and Ike for a hundred grand
For cookie dough don't trip, do this shit for Fun Dip
Payday right on Fifth Avenue
Said welcome to the Big League Chew
Alexander the Great hate me, had to go
Bodied him while hanging out at Jolly Joe's
Gummy bears, gumdrop dime, he had to learn
Put him six feet under, left with gummi worms
Coconut Stacks, no time for making Skittles
Serving Lemonheads, Appleheads, Cherryheads, Red Hots making sizzles

Met a sweetie at a Hershey Bar named Jujube
She hung with Jolly Ranchers, a real Hot Tamale
Stomach rumbling, glad the bar served food
Payed for her dish, cause eating alone is damn rude
Baked Beans, Swedish Fish, barrels of root beer
Her freakiest experience was 3 Musketeers
We left the bar together, said she'd give me a Bit-O-Honey
I want a candy necklace why don't you be my Sugar Daddy
I had the Laffy Taffy, Starburst, Bubble Yum
I'm not a Milk Dud, where you think I come from?
I'm Mr. Goodbar, can never be a vanilla wafer
You get no Jesus Reese's Pieces on it's Now and Later
Okay Gingy, can't resist your Bubblicious
She gave me Blow Pops, Gumballs, and Hershey's Kisses
Almond Joy all night, Kit Kat, Good & Plenty
Lifesaver thought she was dying moaning Oh Henry!
