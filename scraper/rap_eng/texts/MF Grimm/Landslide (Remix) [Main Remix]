MF Grimm - “Landslide (Remix)”
[Emcee(s): MF Grimm]
[Producer(s): DJ Eli]

[Hook: MF Grimm]
You’re too thin to win, too fat to fight back
No matter how you see it, it’s a landslide
Seven digits we be counting, my crew be moving mountains
Step up, nigga, it’s a landslide
It’s wrong to kill a man, but God got to understand that
No matter how He see it, it’s a landslide, and if
He feels I’m a traitor, deal with consequences later
Down in Hell, repercussion for my homicide

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
I don’t wanna be the hardest, for what it’s worth
I just wanna finish my bid on the planet Earth
I pray to God that you stay out my fucking way
‘Cause it’s kill or be killed—that’s how it’s every day
It’s fucked up that a brother can’t just live in peace
But there’s so much jealousy here on the East
A lot of brothers from the West Coast are dope indeed
Some are acting like they don’t fucking bleed
From the East or the West if I offend you
Yo, fuck the battle, nigga, we can make it pay-per-view
I fear no man who inhales oxygen
Exhales dioxide, any war’s a landslide

[Hook: MF Grimm]
You’re too thin to win, too fat to fight back
No matter how you see it, it’s a landslide
Seven digits we be counting, my crew be moving mountains
Step up, nigga, it’s a landslide
It’s wrong to kill a man, but God got to understand that
No matter how He see it, it’s a landslide, and if
He feels I’m a traitor, deal with consequences later
Down in Hell, repercussion for my homicide

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
The bullshit will not be tolerated
Ammunition clicked back, trigger pulled, block illuminated
Thought you saw victory, hallucinated
Body wet, spirit’s dry, soul evaporated
Gravedigger, stripped naked.  Here, try this
White dress, strap on these brand new wings, nigga
Reality embrace dreams in bear hugs
Niggas with juice reduced to scared thugs
Egos ripped with Desert Eagle slugs
Mugs pushed back, rugs washed
Overall, MF the best like Oshkosh
Rappers act hardened, I’ll prosecute like Darden
Challenge me?  What, motherfucker?  Beg your pardon
All hail me as I sing words of war
All fail, see, as we’re battling on tour
Feds tail me, they surveil but get lost
Want to nail me like I’m Jesus to the cross
Brag about their riches.  Deep down, they’re just bitches
Talking murder shit, go to jail, become snitches
Assholes ripped, patched back up in stitches, chopped their
Motherfucking tree down, family left in ditches
The electric chair is hitting switches
Pataki smoke crack—that’s why he’s wacky
Giuliani act Gotti but he’s poonani
Not paisano, he’s Brasco, you’re Donnie.  MF
Is massimo, negro, asesino
Anti-oxidants and aminos, learn lessons
When the C.R.E.A.M. goes and the hoes life flow

[Hook: MF Grimm]
You’re too thin to win, too fat to fight back
No matter how you see it, it’s a landslide
Seven digits we be counting, my crew be moving mountains
Step up, nigga, it’s a landslide
It’s wrong to kill a man, but God got to understand that
No matter how He see it, it’s a landslide, and if
He feels I’m a traitor, deal with consequences later
Down in Hell, repercussion for my homicide
