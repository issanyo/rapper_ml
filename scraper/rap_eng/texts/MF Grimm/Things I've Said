Beautiful intelligent sexy breathtaking
If Im dreaming please dont wake me
Might not get in heaven at least i'll get a taste
I see it when the sun shine bright on your face
Shall i compare thee to a summers day
Thou are more lovely and more temperate
Theres no one above you sweetheart you a ultimate
And a earth angel a gift im confident
Please dont mistake this as just ranting
Woman i find you enchanting
To my house its a honor if you visit
Your perfume drive me crazy girl what the fuck is it
I love your voice i love the way you talk
You're a goddess its like you float on air when you walk
Walking down the street i wish i could hold your hand
I have limitations you understand
Captivated so glad that i got you
Youre hypnotizing all the men are starin at you
Want you adore you know two people go together
From my lips to god i love you forever
Young love soulmates grow old together
Me live without you? never
How do i love thee let me count the ways
I love you more and more everyday
I dedicate every song to you by marvin gaye
You feel the same way about me i pray
Just to be in your presence
Make me feel new
A dream come true girl just to be with you
Not an educated man, far from a fool
I don't need jacob to recognize a jewel
Reverse to a giddy kid right back in school
Boy meets world but world girl rule
How bad i want you you dont have a clue
More than life itself so what can i do
How can i explain to you you're the one for me
Every second with you is a never ending story

"i hope you've heard these words that im saying to you. and day by day i pray you see these words are true.i hope you've heard these words that im saying to you. and day by day i pray you see these words are true."
