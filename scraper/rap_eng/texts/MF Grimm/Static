[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)] (x2)
Don’t want no static in my life
Don’t need no static in my life
Don’t want no static in my life
I don’t want it, I don’t need it

[Verse 1: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
I want to enter back in Heaven, so I’m on my knees
Talking to Creator, frantic, crying, begging please
Forgive me for the things I’ve done, forgive my enemies
War was just a game to us, excuse us for our arrogance
See back-and-forth, a game of death, we took each other lives
Beef lasts forever, Devil plotting my demise
Thought we kept it real, but the life we led was lies
With heart and soul, I do repent, I acknowledge it was ignorancy

[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)] (x2)
Don’t want no static in my life
Don’t need no static in my life
Don’t want no static in my life
I don’t want it, I don’t need it

[Verse 2: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Respect for human life?  Like rebel angels, we had none
Spilling sacred blood and let it dry up in the sun
Forgive my enemies, forgive me for the things I’ve done
War was just a game to us, excuse us for our arrogance
Casualties in war a process, many brothers slain
Hands and knees in dirt, I try to dig ‘em out their graves
Change my way of thinking, maybe babies I can save
With heart and soul, I do repent, I acknowledge it was ignorancy

[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)] (x2)
Don’t want no static in my life
Don’t need no static in my life
Don’t want no static in my life
I don’t want it, I don’t need it

[Verse 3: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Day, we clap with chrome.  Night, we clap with black
From the sun to the moon, wigs got pushed back
From the womb to the tomb, yeah, we bust our guns.  When
One of us die, then our mothers cry.  One
Thing we learned from the wars in history is that
Man is man’s reason for man’s misery.  Make
Sure the children are not in the sequel
Escape this evil, educate the people by
Teaching the babies, enhance their minds and
Let them know, leave these streets behind, build a
Better world, watch mistakes we made, that
We’re sisters and brothers regardless of our color, love each other
Streets are ruthless—no hesitation, they’ll shoot ya.  Gun
Smoke so thick that they can’t see their future.  We are
All God’s creatures, and we’re made magnificent
Divide, they conquer, but, together, we can make a difference

[Interlude: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Static (Don’t need it).  Static (Don’t need it).  It’s time to make a change.  Static.  Static.  Teach the babies, man

[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)] (x2)
Don’t want no static in my life
Don’t need no static in my life
Don’t want no static in my life
I don’t want it, I don’t need it
