Good morning vietnam x3

[Verse 1]
Your trifling favorite rapper
Will decipher this and cipher this
I watch so many die for this
Studio can't leave spot
Pure cheater
Haiku's rock 3 lines like adidas
Super star jet jaguar, the meanest
Possessed, touch of midas
Blessed with the righteous
Insight that
Might just piss of pontiff
Spark brain dead remain unresponsive
Enemies get down on knees and beg
I attack like the black plague
Very deep
Living calculating culminating
Rap computer
{i and mine aquate to the angle of mitre}
Can't keep up with me see
I earn my rep
Can't walk, can't run
Still seem to high step
This rhyme is motherfucking dope
Are you high yet

Good morning vietnam

[Verse 2]
Scientific mind
Scare investors
Die broke in manhattan like Tesla
In gas chamber
But i'm immune to the fumes
Inhale
Take deep breath in the room
Exhale, channel
The escape
I'm Caesar to those
Who call it Planet of the Apes
Will death be messy
Just to rise them
Living is a crime
So I had to organize them
Each with gift to speach I baptize them
Guerilla warfare, a party
We suprised them
Had to cut of the suckers
Neutralize them
The money changers, change
Compromise them
It's like everyone isn't white
I'm blacking out
Brain shield
{health ways?} crash, block em' out
This is motherfucking dope without a doubt

Good morning vietnam x3

Drasar monumental, mf grimm
Good morning vietnam, vietnam
