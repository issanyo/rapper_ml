[MF Grimm]
Don't play board, play man
Concentrate, hold head
Trust no one, people flip
Pimped by the feds
Gods, chess game
Premeditated sins
Killing you and all kin
Play to win man
Feds, hearsay
Blind side swoop me
Put away the luxuries
Tints on a hoopdie
Corrupt police extort
Don't pay they wanna shot me
Proceed to execute me
Cause

The vultures circle me as the sun burns my eyes (vultures swarm)
The vultures circle me patiently they fly

Someone will always want to kill you, be you, see you, stalk you
Adore you, love you, hate you, leave you, find you, flow with you
Ride with you, say they feel you, die for you, lied to you
In your back they grab you, stab you, hurt you, mock you, purse you, jerk you
Momma told you fool once, shame them
Twice, shame you, blame you
So naive you let them demons game you (damn)
So watch out, vultures are falling
Dizzy from circling
They sing with hunger, wings tired from working
Can't castle, the king move while threatened seek shelter
I'm hoping you're not made it being a target in the open
Scars and memories won't fade away
New wounds, more slayed, more paid price and lost life
So many before me in their tracks got stopped
They think I'm weak and they're hoping that I drop
Cause

The vultures circle me as the sun burns my eyes (vultures swarm)
The vultures circle me patiently they fly (vultures swarm)
The vultures circle me and won't let, now I know why (vultures swarm)
The vultures circle me waiting for me to die (vultures)
