[Verse 1]
I fell from grace on my face
Still I rise up, greater
Whatever they expected from me, check it
I'm not as dangerous as I used to be
Which make me more dangerous than I used to be
I'm focused
I care a lot more than usually, teach the babies
Make me not care about losing me, sacrifice
Should I comply with ways and save breath
Or challenge the beast and fight it to the death
Illusions of power create drunks of men
So grapes of wrath are stepped on for the future
Aging fine wine takes some time
But some get impatient, they eat 'em off the vine
Smoke signals float overhead, don't catch the line
Too busy looking down, forgetting that they brown
Friends fear for my life, watch yourself Grimm
Whoever wanna take it, bring it on then

[Hook]
Enemies wanna kill me but they just can't touch me
Through broken glasses, life looks so ugly
Just a bastard, America don't want me
World of hatred, The Creator still loves me
Enemies wanna kill me but they just can't touch me
Through broken glasses, life looks so ugly
Just a bastard, America don't want me
World of hatred, The Creator still loves me

[Verse 2]
Blessed to see another one, this could be the day
Luck is on my side, everything goes my way
But if I make the wrong move, it could be the last
Fearing death in the future keep you living in the past
King want me dead so now he flip his lid
A kid, I hid and did a bid in pyramids
Got in tune with myself, learned that I'm powerful
My mind lift me up the day that my body fell
Professor X, over matter I do it well
Verbal is the voodoo, a verse is the spell
Levitate through Manhattan, maneuver around the hate
I strive to be a better man, won't be compromised
Bigger problems bigger man, God increased my size
Sight beyond sight, truly my eyes is on the prize
Solar rays phase, snowmen run city
Sun goes down, they wonder will I go down with it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Some try to test and question our divinity
MF Grimm, MF DOOM, Serengeti trinity
I lead the way to victory, blood will be the trail
No matter who we face, believe me we'll prevail
All hail
