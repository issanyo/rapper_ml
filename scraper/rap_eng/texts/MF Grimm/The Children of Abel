[Verse 1]
Two brothers start to rumble over cheddar
One felt the other was treated better
One mad cause the don did not bless him
One glad cause the don did not stress him
One jealous and wants to pay him back
Evil covert, yes sneak attack
One got the gun that killed the other
Now mind you as I say this both are brothers
Blind with hatred, forgot that he loved him
Nine with full clip, no doubt he planned to rub him
One wish the other wasn't born
One don't know what's going on
One ready, commit a homicide
Body he will hide and then he'll lie
One fired, one brother died
That night one mother cried

[Chorus]
The children of Abel (The children of Abel)
The children of Abel (The children of Abel)
Thanks to your uncle Cain
You don't have a name
You could've been great

[Verse 2]
How could a man be cold hearted
And kill his brother who didn't start it
Never return dearly departed
Demons on Earth act retarded
Righteous sacrifice and not guarded
Angels on planet are outsmarted
Off to the morgue he was carted
Was it a murder or was he martyred?
With the mark on the beast he was honored
Now he lives in fear, mind bothered
Drenched with tears is his father
The seed of Seth will succeed you
Family tree did not need you
Forgiveness he wants, but will you?
Everything is wrong
Before you were born the motherfucker killed you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
A savage now outcasted
Beast is marked and can't be blasted
The land of the lost is now mastered
How was the course you selfish bastard?
Not in your head and now you wander
How many hells is what you wonder
Amount of stages will be infinite
The rage of demons will be ultimate
The army of angels tell you handle it
Echo in your mind, time rattle you
Death is an emcee who came to battle you
My horse is pale, plus the saddle too
Just like your face, so I'm Sitting Bull
Scalps taken, cowboys is spitting bull
I die later for ones that live for now
All hands and please bow for

[Chorus]
This is for the angels roaming on Earth
This is for the demons roaming on Earth

[Repeat x5]
I lead the way, remember that
I lead the way
