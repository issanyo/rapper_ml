[Emcee(s): n/a]
[Producer(s): n/a]

[Interviewer and GM Grimm]
Interviewer: I read, uh, recently, uh, I think it was in either an email or, or something that was posted that, um, that you go by the name GM Grimm now
GM Grimm: Yeah
Interviewer: And, uh, what, what prompted that change?
GM Grimm: Actually, it was a chain reaction from my partner, um, Roc Raida.  We, we’ve been a group.  I mean, we’ve been together about just mad damn near about fifteen years.  You know, he’s, he’s my DJ, I’m his emcee, so it’s like... He, he’s been elevate to a Grandmaster, and I kind of just donned myself Grandmaster, but I’m capable of becoming Grandmaster through him, so I just changed it Grandmaster Grimm.  I feel I, I feel I’ve earned that respect, and even Chuck D acknowledged me as Grandmaster Grimm, so if he, if Chuck D does it, it’s alright with me, and I don’t see why I should bother anyone
