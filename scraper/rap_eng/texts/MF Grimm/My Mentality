[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
So many brothers are gone, I’m still here for a reason
On the paper chase, tracking like a bounty hunter
Got war stories, all true, real tragic
Life is still pretty enough to win a beauty pageant
Success is hard to catch, most are glad to touch it
I’m trying to grab it, man, lock on it when I clutch it
It’s not like I love it—surviving, it is needed
I got a family, and, without this paper, I can’t feed it
Plus I’m far from greedy.  MF spread love
Act like Ebenezer—sometimes, that’s what bread does
Lying and cheating and fiending like a head does
Too many died, money can’t make it the way it was
Moving narcotics?  Nah, that’s ancient
Though the money’s clean, I still got a dirty conscience
Die trying?  My death?  I’m not viewing it
I’ma get rich and live good doing it

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Keep my eye on my money.  Try to mace me, left me blind
I see in the dark, a way out is what I’ll find.  As
I lead the way, non-believers left behind.  There’s
A price to pay if you worship riches ‘cause
Hell is blazing, soul dried like a raisin
How evil this world can be is so amazing
Influential be demons of temptation, but no longer they’re fazing
Don’t want finer things?  I would be a liar
The only difference now is how it all get acquired
No cocaine, no selling heroin
I’m making legal ends all with a pad and pen
I was told: don’t work harder, nigga.  Work smarter
Get that paper like you’re Sean John or Shawn Carter
I have no choice but to become a millionaire
So many of my brothers died just to get me here
