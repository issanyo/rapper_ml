[Nate Denver]

Dark skies, barely able to see the bats fly
But you know they're heading home
Thats your home
Bats know better than to live in the cracks
Where the monsters hang their hats
They're all gonna die
So we found the entry to their cave
Or more appropriately the exit to the grave
And we sealed them all up for life
Seemed like it took forever for them all to die
[MF Grimm] Bush
Cloud for life
The sound of hopeless scratching lasted all night
But there was no other way
There's always another way

[MF Grimm Verse]

Freedom

How bad do you really wanna keep on breathing
Forces wanna stop you from it
You don't deserve it
Less than human
Island of monsters
Roman imposters
Gonna watch out now
They've come to get you
Take life from you
Fema say they own you
Freedom has shown you
Light through the dark skies
Dictate who dies
On us our are eyes
Wishing for our demise
We are the people
One day we will rise
Even if first fall
No sugar coating
Shit might get worse
Before it gets ammended
Do you really love life
Then you must defend it
Even if we lose it
Cuz if we lose life living
Then we don't really lose it, feel me
Breast plate purple blue crimson
Worn by the c.o's at the prison
No time for kissing on the pope's ring
Jesus wasn't down with the bling bling
Death of the poor taken as a joke
The presidents retarded and hes sniffin' coke


Them black people down there they alright
As long as they keep in they' place

Jesus!

[MF Bash Verse]

I phase into this plain
One god day by day
Change yer last days strange
Slay the graze
And dark the black thoughts
An burn the honey glaze
And dark stars shine
Upon my purple haze
And pitbulls lock
In the mind of the tame
And souless enteritys
Escorsion just blaze
My sport just raid
Hold court an grain
An cause pain
Ya lossing
Motherfucking paid
And field niggas
Floss in vain
Acting boss man
Untoil the bait?
Flow shade unseen
Drop a nate
Lucifer dante
Call a spade a spade
For the love i'll never trade
One heart one mind to change
On ya grave the flower grow
From the concrete through the shit
That I have to wade
Motherfucking bash bruce wayne
The dark knight never play and sever all ya gains
