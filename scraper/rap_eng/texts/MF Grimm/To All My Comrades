MF Grimm - “To All My Comrades”
[Emcee(s): MF Grimm]
[Producer(s): Metal Fingers (AKA MF DOOM)]

[Intro: MF Grimm]
Universal nomads in war, fallen comrades, even though we are predators, prey is perspective.  I stare from the mountain, down into the lights of civilization, and look into the dark hearts of these savages mad at us because we are free.  We cannot be trained, brainwashed, or domesticated like dogs who is happy to beg for scraps.  Life is in the hunt itself.  We are greater than dogs.  We are wolves

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
I watched them play dead
Play fetch, pull ropes like dopes
Slaves walked on a leash, paws bleeding
From the concrete.  Run too fast
They get yanked back or beat with rolled-up paper
They can’t hear the call of the wild.  That’s hell
To a canine.  They can’t tell us what to do
That’s why they go to the park
And we go to the zoo.  Fallen
Comrades, the civilized savages are shrinking our
Territory rapidly, killing all trees
And natural resources.  The hunt is short
Today.  My brothers
We are now the prey, last
Of a dying breed.  Evil ones killing us
While we’re trying to breathe
Raid our dens, murdering pack leaders and soulmates
Cubs go astray, orphaned
Acting like dogs because they don’t understand
But my tears are not for them
My tears are for man
They must pay

[Outro: MF Grimm]
There is no way to physically express my loss of all of you.  And joy is knowing that I will see all of you soon.  But until then, my fallen comrades, for you, I howl at the moon
