[Hook: MF Grimm]
Scars and memories, memories and scars
I look up in the sky and I wonder where you are
Can’t nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
Memories and scars, scars and memories
Talk to me, kid, ‘cause I need some guidance please
Can’t nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
Scars and memories, memories and scars
I look up in the sky and I wonder where you are
Can’t nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
I’m writing this letter from Lenox Hill Hospital
I’m so sorry that I missed your funeral
But silhouettes of you are trapped inside my head
As I lay in ICU hanging on, wishing I was dead
Trying to convince someone to pull the plug and let it end
I lost my best friend, plus I’ll never walk again
Now that you’re gone, it really don’t matter
Becoming a star, becoming a superstar.  God
Threw rocks at my glass heart and it shattered
I look up in the sky and I wonder where you are
Crying like a baby, staring at your picture
I’m mad at the world, kid.  I’m wishing I was with ya
The world is on my shoulders, now the weight is kind of hefty
I loved my little shorty, but my little shorty left me
In a few minutes time, with the help of a nine, I went from
King of the rhymes to the victim of crime
I gotta stop and wipe my tears, G
Ayyo, Jay, respond, let me know you hear me

[Hook: MF Grimm]
Scars and memories, memories and scars
I look up in the sky and I wonder where you are
Can’t nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
Memories and scars, scars and memories
Talk to me, kid, ‘cause I need some guidance please
Can’t nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga

[Verse 2: Jay Black and MF Grimm]
[Jay Black]
You will walk again.  Jay Black won’t let you down
As for rap, represent and snatch the fucking crown
Fuck most these rappers ‘cause, no, they’re not your friends
So don’t wait for no battle, bring the noise straight to them
I don’t give a damn if the nigga is your idol
Implant in his head that he better think survival
I don’t give a fuck about his crew or the fame
Each one of them niggas, step to ‘em and blow ‘em out the frame
[MF Grimm]
But Jay, I want the days when we were just chilling
Riding around in cars, dressing nice, and counting millions
[Jay Black]
Those days are over for us, so understand you
My man, but it’s time to step forward to represent the fam
Like I’m Jesus Christ, I’m paying for our sins
Take these niggas to war for me, let the games begin
I want you off the street ‘cause the street is not the move
Don’t let me die for nothing, test your skills, show and prove
Niggas think they’re ill, but show ‘em you are iller.  In the
Past, yo, we killed but wasn’t raised to be no killers
Money and murder’s hand-to-hand, it come with territory
Manhattan war stories were the price to pay for glory
Cash rules everything around us
[MF Grimm]
But everyone
Around us is not down with us, they plot, scheme, surround us
There’s jealousy, envy, niggas want to hurt me
I can’t move my legs, Jay, so that shit just irks me
Right now, I’d be better off dying, G.  I don’t
Think that I can function in society
‘Cause I paid the cost, you paid the cost
The family paid the cost, and now I’m feeling lost
Because you went away, and now my skies are gray
I don’t know what to feel, I don’t know what to say
I don’t know what to do, I need you to impinge
My life is like a door, hanging off the hinge
I tried to improvise and go with the flow
But, to my surprise, the flow is so slow
I’m really confused, advice you have to give
I’m not afraid to die but, right now, I’m afraid to live

[Hook: MF Grimm]
Scars and memories, memories and scars
I look up in the sky and I wonder where you are
Can’t nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
Memories and scars, scars and memories
Talk to me, kid, ‘cause I need some guidance please
Can’t nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga

[Verse 3: MF Grimm and Jay Black]
[MF Grimm]
I don’t know my title, so I’m a little sad, man
What’s the difference between a genius and a madman?
[Jay Black]
A genius is exceptional, he breaks down the whole
Madmen are not rational but they do have a goal
To be a genius or a madman is in your mind
[MF Grimm]
But is it possible for the two to intertwine?
[Jay Black]
Yes, when
A genius uses poems just to focus on crime
Greed, or make nuclear bombs all the time
[MF Grimm]
In this
Materialistic world, is there any type of hope? (Nope)
Will Catholics ever have a black pope?
I write rhymes like Riddler, list them like Schindler
A lot of religious figures on this planet are just swindlers
[Jay Black]
What do you see?
[MF Grimm]
Sight beyond sight, zones of twilight
The afterlife, a new world is what I like
[Jay Black]
You don’t like Commandments but just do them
[MF Grimm]
Aight, but when you
Talk to God again, could you give these questions to Him?
[Jay Black]
They can’t be too long ‘cause He’s a busy man
So tell me about six, and I’ll relay them if I can
[MF Grimm]
(One) God, why is my mighty nation lost?
(Two) Why’d You let Jesus Christ be put on the cross?
(Three) Why is my people poor and oh so sore? (Niggas is fucked up)
(In Harlem) In Harlem, all I see is funeral homes and liquor stores
(Four) Why’d You let the Indians get used and abused?
(Five) Why’d You let Hitler crucify all the Jews?
Some races will never see the best out of life
(This is fucked up) It’s like You made a big-ass test out of life.  I got
Love for You, God, but could You explain to me
(Six) Why You took my legs and Jay and dished out so much pain to me?

[Outro: Jay Black]
Don’t stress that, kid.  You know how it’s life.  Not even death can separate the love
