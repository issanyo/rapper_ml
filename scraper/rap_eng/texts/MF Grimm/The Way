[Emcee(s): Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
[Producer(s): X-Ray Da Mindbenda (Original Instrumental from X-Ray Da Mindbenda - “Show Me the Way (X-Ray Instrumentals Version)”)]

[Verse 1: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Multiple times, enemies tried to kill me
Each time, I shined, bounced back from it
They don’t understand my power
I came to the planet for a purpose
To uplift all my people
To upset foes that’s evil.  Revo-
-lution will not be televised
Time’s changed, no surprise
It’s now on the internet and satellites
Equal rights.  We must fight
Today is the first day of the Last Days
Death control, they kill us different ways
In the streets, look around.  Kids are wilding, boys are shooting, girls
Are tricking, parents missing, on a mission, smoking crack
We must get our family structure back
To raise a child, it take a whole village, but now
The whole village is run by old villains
Cold in their ways of covert killings
They brainwash the masses.  In God we trust
But the flesh is weak, so do God trust us?
When your life’s on the line, who do you trust?
When your life’s on the line, who do you trust?

[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Everybody wants to be the superstar
Everybody can’t be the superstar
Jet Jaguar is the Superstar.  I
Don’t give a fuck about who you are, I
Lead the way as we march through the fire, I
Lead the way through the dangers of the wilderness, I
Lead the way while the fam face famine, I
Lead the way until we get to paradise, I
Lead the way if it takes me to die for war, I
Lead the way if that is
The price to pay, no matter what it takes, I’ma
Get you there.  Superhero’s here now, so
Have no fear.  Come on, start the revolution

[Verse 2: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
I’m a grown man, talk about grown man things, but like
An old man, prefer discuss when we were kings.  Feel I’m
A wise man, I know why the caged bird sings: he hide
The sorrow in song ‘cause pain it brings.  Through
The bars, see sky but cannot fly
Disenchanted with life, don’t care if he die
Keep his head or be tried.  He sings in his cage
Beautiful it sounds but it truly is rage
Frequency engaged, it’s a cry of war
‘Til they open the door, he’s gonna cry some more, going
Out his mind, he chirps and tweets, and then they
Bring him his seeds, he peck the hand that feeds and take
Enjoyment when he see the hand that feeds just bleeds, and seize
The moment—cage open, fly, soar over trees, start
Flapping his wings.  Several years it’d been, but
Once again, his face is in the wind

“Well, he wouldn’t go to this trouble for nothing, then he must have been after something of yours”
