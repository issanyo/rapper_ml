[Intro (Overlapped with Bridge 1 and Hook): MF Grimm]
Crucial.  Nice track, baby.  Are we on the air?  I’m the Gingerbread Man.  Catch me if you can.  You gotta dance.  I’m coming.  Can you hear it?  Lay you down.  I will lay you down, nigga

[Bridge 1 (Overlapped with Intro): Samples with Scratches by DJ Crucial]
“Catch me if you can” - The Notorious B.I.G. - “Everyday Struggle”
“Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man” - The Notorious B.I.G. - “Everyday Struggle”

[Hook (Overlapped with Intro): MF Grimm]
I’m addicted to murder (I’m relapsing)
I’m looking at the gun (Then I’m fiending)
I hear the whisper (The Devil said)
“Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up”
In his brain I put a bullet (See, there’s no stalling)
I see where the shell fell (Two for falling)
I hear the whisper (The Devil said)
“Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up”

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
I got a problem: I’m addicted to murder
My high is smoking my enemies
Same way someone’s addicted to alcohol
I love twisting caps, leaving brains on the walls
Oxygen is precious, space you take up
Slug in your nugget, watch your skull break up
Night-night, motherfucker.  You won’t wake up
Pain is a permanent part of my makeup (That’s right)
I’m not jealous if you’re balling, man (I don’t care)
This shit just be calling me man.  I can’t
Help it.  I guess, deep down, I’m really weak (Yeah)
I shut the fuck up when my gun wanna speak (Shhh)
I don’t know why my impulse is so dark, but it
Lights right up when I start to spark.  Some
Feel killers are artificially inseminated, but my
Mama know I’m naturally born (That’s right)

[Hook: MF Grimm]
I’m addicted to murder (I’m relapsing)
I’m looking at the gun (Then I’m fiending)
I hear the whisper (The Devil said)
“Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up” (“Lay him down”)
In his brain I put a bullet (See, there’s no stalling)
I see where the shell fell (Two for falling)
I hear the whisper (The Devil said)
“Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up” (“Lay him down”)

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
You gotta go.  I won’t sugarcoat it (No doubt)
Police search around for a motive (I don’t know)
Meanwhile, you’re dead.  It sucks, don’t it?
Life is gonna be missed, now won’t it?
Dodging indictments.  Enemies?  I’m doing ‘em
Bodies are dropping, tampering with witnesses
Murderous evasions, I’ve learned the art of
Persuasion—who you love the most is the one blazing
One love no more, I’m not playing
One shot, one kill, no grazing
The motive is the murder itself, so I risk it
Point-two-two-three, I’ma rip shit
CSI broken down to ballistics
The Gingerbread Man, can’t catch him—I’m a mystic
Some feel killers are artificially inseminated
My mama know I’m naturally born

[Hook (Overlapped with Interlude): MF Grimm]
I’m addicted to murder (I’m relapsing)

In his brain I put a bullet (See, there’s no stalling)

“Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up” (“Lay him down”)

[Interlude (Overlapped with Hook): MF Grimm]
That’s right.  Can you hear it?  That’s right
