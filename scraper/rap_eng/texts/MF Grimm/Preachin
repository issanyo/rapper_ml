Ass is ironic
With plates of tectonic
A crust thats so goddess it comes to the same difference
Livin in a world where perfection is a vision
Perfering non fiction and plates of superstition
Its a mission that I'm living through
With any type of sanity
Wife of wall street cocaine and fair vanity
Righting only written rules
Blowing what they giving you
Classic is a simple noose clear before the pickachu

Too many bottles shattered glass and i loose myself
Long way from home and i loose myself
Long way from home son checking on the red eye
Tryna drop a tab in a day
Just like a horse fly
Flowing through a saturated stream if you kill yourself

Dogs a fucking lie
So defined beauty
So defy rhymes supply and die smoothly
So fucking tried implied to nine rufies
Super fly guy good bye to my choosy

Rigamortis and a shmorgis board
Corner of the horder store boarded it up
Its what the border for
Let them in and let it go itching for the killest dro
Death is more alive than the life that I'm looking for

Hey mister line sir
Where can i find her tryna have a feast of human vagina
Inhale a line of dust and spider
Two inches on a map and then I'm inside ya

Is it risky
Doin me through the tv
Meeting me with a paper bag and a VC
Are you going to ask me about how i got that
Silk is so smoothy something from the movies

Crack addict colors showing on your face naw
Used to have a heart the same color as based god
Yea naw but who knew
That little cindy lou who
Would run around in panties behind the scenes of grinch two

We all growing up misfired ourselves

I figured myself out with abundance of wealth
But i found routes to doubts to much more importance
The fortune run by the extortion of orphans

My psychiatrist can't get rid of this
Its just a gif of myley cyrus clitoris
Its burning flames getting cut by the genesis
Fired cix im gonna send his ass to jail
Haven dark dreams bout his ass as well
Walking backwards with a mother fucking cask and pail
Then I'm falling down fuck around with jack and jale
Nigerian tactics like I'm dark as hell

Throwing up frogs like I'm under a spell
With more confidence speaking from the bottom of wells
But no you too hipster to reach for the surface
Dollar in need but nothing but young curtis

Ears bleeding from the bass you reciving
Gods just a mystical god we believe in
Id be a better kid if one person had seen
I'm living in the now so fuck rap I'm preachin
