MF Grimm - “Still My Love”
[Emcee(s): MF Grimm]
[Producer(s): The Architech]

[Intro: Sample from MF DOOM & MF Grimm - “My Love”]
One by one, bitch niggas get served as I
Touch nerves with these Special Herbs

[Hook: MF Grimm]
For my niggas in the
Street, I give (love).  For my niggas locked
Up, I give (love).  For the sisters in the
Struggle, I give (love).  This is all
My (love) transformed through beats.  In the
Street, I give (love).  For my niggas locked
Up, I give (love).  For the sisters in the
Struggle, I give (love).  This is all
My (love) transformed through beats

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
One by one, bitch niggas get served as I
Touch nerves with those Special Herbs
Now seasoned by The Architech, spiced up the words
Streets move fast, so everything is blurred
Give streets my love, I can’t forget you
Those who supported me, be nothing without you
The best of times, the worst of times
Scars & Memories travel Perc’ through time
Before a nigga made a dime, before a nigga rhymed
Watched people in the street from the bottom climb
They went after what they wanted, hunger didn’t stop
Defied all the odds and made it to the top
Some didn’t get the chance, murdered real young
Died over bullshit, others got strung
Forgot they were king and queens, crack touched lungs
Some fought law, but law still won
Streets is a movie, new actors want a role
Crackheads, heads cracked, pack of crack stole
Some stay in streets too long, took a toll
Couldn’t do the time, switched, became a mole

[Hook: MF Grimm]
For my niggas in the
Street, I give (love).  For my niggas locked
Up, I give (love).  For the sisters in the
Struggle, I give (love).  This is all
My (love) transformed through beats.  In the
Street, I give (love).  For my niggas locked
Up, I give (love).  For the sisters in the
Struggle, I give (love).  This is all
My (love) transformed through beats

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Seconds go by, I’m starting to feel my age
Scars, thirty-five of ‘em, four stars later
Still in trenches, can’t help it—I’m a leader
Weight on shoulders, load ain’t getting lighter
Family suffer, squat to lift burden
Got good grip, but legs are trembling
Focus on chi, meditate, settle in
Brace self, good times I’m remembering
Life was easy carried in momma’s arms
Difficult older, momma know I carry arms
Her son’s a fighter, momma know I carry on
Paralyzed, but momma know I carry on
Percy’ll be a billionaire, believe Mr. Carey’s on
I can’t rest.  I guess I’ll do it when I’m gone
Hold back my dreams—on this planet, there’s none
To show the streets that it can be done ‘cause

[Hook: MF Grimm]
For my niggas in the
Street, I give (love).  For my niggas locked
Up, I give (love).  For the sisters in the
Struggle, I give (love).  This is all
My (love) transformed through beats.  In the
Street, I give (love).  For my niggas locked
Up, I give (love).  For the sisters in the
Struggle, I give (love).  This is all
My (love) transformed through beats

[Verse 3: MF Grimm]
Women with beautiful looks got them far
Got them a hustler, a ghetto street star
Got them jewelry, got them cars
And got some killed and put behind bars
Put in situations they don’t want to be in
Sisters locked down, my heart for you is bleeding
Little kids watch street life and was shown
Tried it on their own, got murdered like they’re grown
Others got a hundred years, whole life blown
Feeling like a fool, should’ve stayed their ass in school
A few did make it, but most got shot
The School of Hard Knocks, from you I learned a lot, so
(Thank you)

[Outro: MF Grimm]
Love.  Love.  Love (transformed through beats).  Love.  Love.  Love.  Love (transformed through beats).  That’s the end
