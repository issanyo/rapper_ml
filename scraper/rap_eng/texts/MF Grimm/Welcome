Let Me Shine Throughout The Night

Bitch let me shine

Let Me Shine Throughout The Night
With My Eyes Open Wide
Let Me Shine Throughout The Night
Since I Sleep At Sunrise
And Captivate Your Night
Pass Me The Mic Ike
So I Can Break The ICE

Who Knew Fly's Came Out At Night
But I Guess They Do
Who Knew My Lies Could Fly
But I Guess They Do
So Anything Will Do
Be Warry Of Who's Who In Your Krew
Cuz They Might End Up Fucking You
Im Not Fucking With You
This Shit Is Like Fucking Food
Eat This Shit Its Good
Won't Fuck Up A Single Tooth
Im Not Wasting My Time In The Booth

I Do This For the listener
And the great Envisioner
Make everything stay perpendicular

Im Smoking Dank But Not On Neutral
You Other Hoes Are Feudal
The wackness is so crucial
Im taking all you out brutal
With or without fucked pupils
The disses will only quadrupel
Im Ill without your approval
But a refusal is always usual

Its Hard To Find Any Meaning
When you stay up a whole day feening
Murders your thoughts and feelings
I was that human being
Now i keep the pen stinging
Flicking it to the rythim
Just keep livin wishen and spitten
Not for the riches
BUT enrichment
Of being well respected
Fag emcees detected
Deleted and deflected
Make'em stop breeding
I'm 20 and Addicted
To Some Contradictions
(A Demon)
XXXXXXTTTTCCCCCC

Did Yall Know We Brought This Shit
Thanks Tour muthufuckin expenses
Now hating niggas defensive
Tryn to state their perspective
Bitches feel like congestion
Heaters and bangers in our possession
For your new obsession
OBJECTIONS
Objections vs Objective
Thank god were selective
And our murders descriptive
Dismissing a spitting rich bitch
Can't get with the sickness
Hit this ima collapse
Fall back flat hash
Man and I ain't coming back

This shit is real
The evils of the underground sound
Trapping us under the moon cuz we got too wild
They looked at him gave up on me
No hope for that nigga putting coke tru his nose
What happened to the dream team?
Exchanged for a beat it was that or live in the street
Welcome to the industry
Where they make you a money making coke sniffing freak with gold teeth
We asked for this, as much as we asked for it
Not to rain acid please
Its 2012 mothafucka everything is happenin
I pawned my manners for a fat sack of trees fast
Atleast i last long enough to not crash
If my shits dope then theres fucking hope
Hopefully these clowns dont take long to sitdown
King with no crown still you will bow
I stayed home to write cuz im broke cooking coke
Trying to make ends for my dreams fuck these fiends
Never gave a shit cuz im not a fucking asshole
I never made a threat hanged these foos with a lasso
Always got respect made a name for my set
Straight from the west separated from the best
If i hope in a booth you'll be shaking in yo boots
Take your last breath before you get split in 2

YO its the MLK, If you dont know that now you know mothafucka
Welcome, welcome to the fucking moon
To the fucking moon
BITCH
