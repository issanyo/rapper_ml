[MF Grimm]
This was the only rhyme I was supposed to write
That never should've happened
This never should've existed

[Verse 1]
I don't know where to start, you were my heart
You walked into the light, now I'm sitting in the dark
I was locked inside the box, before I even knew
My angel paid me a visit, he resembled you
He never said a word, glared, disappeared
It was weird, got on the phone, had a fear
Something wasn't right, what was the meaning of the sign?
Found out you died
All I could do was cry, cause I was up in prison
Praying to the creator that you were still living
And this was a dream, grab my skin I'm pinching
Pinching so hard, off the skin is ripping
Reality is slipping, away from me
All is crazy, now I feen
I had to think of something, in a fast way
To block out today

[Chorus]
It was like yesterday, we were both kids in that playground
Just you and me
Now I would give up anything for us back inside that playground
Just you and me
It was like yesterday, we were both kids in that playground
Just you and me
Now I would give up anything for us back inside that playground
Just you and me
Can we go back to yesterday?

[Verse 2]
Released from prison, no longer a slave
I hear you calling me, right from your grave
I need you energy, the spot you buried where I lay
As we switch dimensions, the things to me you say
Plan for my future, but take it day by day
Yeah they had to shoot you, in such a coward's way
When they shot you in the back, they took your life like that
They also killed me
Once again I resurrect, on your grave is growing grass
I'ma be that star you want and get this fucking cash
The Benzes and the Jags, to my people be so helpful
The best weapon for me right now is be successful
Music is a drug, distribution is the game
International's the rules, want the money fuck the fame
Grab beats from J Money, the studio is paid
Just to block out today

[Chorus]
