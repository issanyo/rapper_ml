[Intro]

(Death is silent painless, I didn't know what happened, I was suddenly standing above my body...)

[Verse 1]

It's a pity from the chair I can't dance like I'm Diddy
Was that a compliment or disrespect of Diddy
They say that he's an MC, but come on now, really is he?
Nah, if I could get up I would Harlem shake until I'm dizzy
Walk into a club, get on dance floor, get busy
And yes I am a pro at this just like my boy named Twizzy
And I don't need no Alize, Hennessy or Tanqueray
No Patron, just a microphone or some day by day
Always do things my way, always mean the things I say
Always make my foes feel my wrath, get the last laugh
I'm from the upper west side, Manhattan, yes the best side
While growing up, in rap coming up
Talent shows, mad flows, yeah I'm showing up
Home grown, name known, Grimm is blowing up
I'ma make it to the top of rap, I'm in it to win it
And yes I'm in Manhattan and I'll be there in a minute


(Hook)

(All I need) is a microphone
(All I need) is my DJ
(All I need) is a beat
(All I need) is the beat pro
(All I need) is a microphone
(All I need) is my DJ
(All I need) is a beat
(All I need) is the beat pro


(Verse 2 )

I inhale ether, blow it out like it's reefer
It don't affect me because I'm the grim reaper
Dreams as a child make my voice come out speakers
I collected microphones like different pairs of sneakers
A true b-boy, ran around the battled
Gun slinger, High noon, jumped off Saddle
The middle of the town, beef we gotta settle
Acapellas, screaming loud, like it's heavy metal
Flow for flow, break em down, get up in his mental
Try to kill him with my words, it's not accidental
I'm not being gentle, trying to dismantle
You thought it was a knife the way I drew blood with a pencil
I am unbeatable, challenge disagreeable's
Flow with Gamma Rays so, no, I'm not see-able
Transform, roll out, a bullet changed my vehicle
Optimus illusions, overcome obstacles
I never get heated, I'm as cool as a popsicle
Pop too much shit, Grim Reaper bust his popsicle
Broad daylight, shine in eyes cause it's nickel
It touch ya funny bone, but it won't tickle


(Hook)
