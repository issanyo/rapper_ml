[Intro: MF Grimm]
Wax on, wax off

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Teacher betrayed, only way could be slain
But these evil students of yours don't understand
Died with the pebble stone gripped in your hand
Flow like water while spitting fire
Master the earth, then gone like the wind
You taught me the grounding begins from within
Sometime, when release the chi, I spree
Break wood, break sticks and bricks with my head
Toughest than our faces getting blacks to break bread
Jealous of the teacher, that's why you were there
Infinite, so your style will live on
I learned discipline, for you I push on
To let them know you're not gone
To let them know you're not gone
Traveled to the mountain, studied different techniques
Days turned to weeks, weeks turned to years
I grew long hair and long beard
I'm a grandmaster now, not too many can compare
Brain, the head's speed, I snatch words out the air
Murderous to world, and that's the burden I bear
I learned to use thoughts for defense like a shield
Plus penetrate force fields, wind on attack
Master of flows, know all styles of rap
They could kick gangsta shit, I don't give a fuck
I beat'em with their own words, like the nunchucks
Sixteen bars, so murderous they are
Accurate as like I'm throwing sixteen stars
I challenge their whole school, right in their temple
Defeated their master, right in their temple
I beat each one to death, right in their temple
Deadly pressure point hit, right in their temple
In the grave, with few, now they all lay
Just had to show 'em that we don't play
So now Rest In Peace and say:

[Outro]
Everything's gonna be OK
Everything's gonna be OK
The student got it under control
The student got everything under control
Alright with this
Teacher...
Teacher?..
Teacher?..
Where you at?
