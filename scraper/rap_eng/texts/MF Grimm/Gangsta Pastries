Candyland, we dont play here
Masterplan, we're about the dough
Understand, you can die here
Gingerbread, run around with Chico

Shook up, I know they won't get me
Cookies and candy, being stingy with gingy
Clear the block out, reign here is done
Guns spits shells, turns faces to crumbs
We learned to stay numb, cause here we die young
Half baked crew dont wait, we take funds
We break you, your bubblegum
Down we shake you, torture
Hoping to say we'll make you
... and try to rise up, thats what this cake do
Paranoid, I haunt like cookie boys
Stove broken, natural ingredients, state smoking
Destroy all, we ain't joking
So, icing off, slice and all watching em fall
Shortbread squeeze, leave for more debt
Showing the maple sugar, the gat extract
Standing ovation in the streets, we clap
Encore, love it so much we clap more
For sure, the cake we sell here is raw
(missing line)
The world is mine, check my stats, my word is bond
(missing lines)

Candyland, we dont play here
Masterplan, we're about the dough
Understand, you can die here
Gingerbread, run around with Chico
