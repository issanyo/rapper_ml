Friends are brothers and enemies are twins
You love to hear the story again and again
Design so violent, make sure we don't win
Fifteen minutes each to crash and burn
Exercise freedom of speech, they'll trash your existence
Even skin bleached, you're faced with resistance
So scared niggas shut the fuck up and keep your distance
Instead of switching frequencies and focus on the mission
Trying to increase fan base by ass kissing
Stupid motherfucker got shit on nose
Condoleeza's in the White House posing like she Mona
People of sun turning polar
Ice Age burning again frozen solar, solid
Like dogs got people of color, collared
Killing each other for a diamond
Pardon me, I really meant to say a dollar
Mothers all they can do is holler
Because genocide is killing future scholars

When they're hungry they just eat us up
American Hunger
Hate our kind, mad want to beat us up
American Hunger
These chains on our legs they slow us up
American Hunger
If they could they would just blow us up
American Hunger
When they're hungry they just eat us up
American Hunger
Hate our kind, mad want to beat us up
American Hunger
These chains on our legs they slow us up
American Hunger
If they could they would just blow us up
American Hunger

Rap beef fronting like the rowdy
Fight set up like Ralph and Harvey
Beef byproducts taste like chicken
Need to stop bullshit, focus on children
I am a warrior no stranger to a killing
I know we're not perfect but who's willing
Stop genocide, put together millions
Brothers need to rise combine and buy buildings
Get kids to school because we're losing
Think shit is cool, the streets they're choosing
