[Hook]
Fredo, I know it was you; you broke my heart
(I love you) We're brothers man
Fredo, I know it was you; you broke my heart
(I love you) We're brothers man
Fredo, I know it was you; you broke my heart
(I love you) We're brothers man
Fredo, I know it was you; you broke my heart

[Verse 1]
I tried to be strong just like pop was
Build for the family just like pop did
Confront all our enemies that wanted to kill us
Which became normal to us cause we were pop kids
To the death, loyal was the posse
Just like Pop had with Luca Brasi
Paulie called in sick, they shot the don, he couldn't run
It was going down, you was so shook you dropped your gun
I remember Sollozzo wanted pop dead
I sat at the table; put a bullet in his head
Then I had to bounce, it was hot but broken hearted
I thought it ended but really the war just started
His body was getting weak, his mind was strong
Pop knew it was Barzini all along
I learned so much from that old man
Pop chose me to lead and you couldn't understand
But I love you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Betrayed your own blood for some money
You learned nothing from the family losing Sonny
I'm your brother; no one's supposed to split the team
Slapped you around town, I took care of Moe Greene
Pop had Clemenza, pop had Tessio
Turned out that Tessio was just a pussy so
But in the old country Tommasino
He was so well loved but a assassino
This little thing of ours, the only life that we know
Trust is everything, that's what we show
I only wanna keep you out of harm's way
Because of jealously from me you choose to stray
Confusion, blinded by high rollers
The use you as laid by Johnny Ola
Hyman Roth thought you were the solution
Because of you, I almost met my execution
But I love you

[Hook]
