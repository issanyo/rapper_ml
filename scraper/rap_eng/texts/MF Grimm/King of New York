MF Grimm - “King of New York”
[Emcee(s): MF Grimm]
[Producer(s): Ninja B]

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
I’m the King of New York
I rule with an iron fist
Gold around my neck and on my fingers and wrist
A shift full of pitiful punks on my shit list
Drop the “S,” now “shit” means “hit list”
Motherfuckers want to sit at my spot a lot
‘Cause what I got, but my seat’s hot
It’s not your turn, your black ass’ll burn to the ground
Pound for pound, twelve rounds—how that sound?
A title bout, call timeout.  Your rhymes are tired
Without a doubt, no clout, smelling like sauer-
-kraut.  Mine stay hard like a dick on Stout
Guinness, I’m in this to win this, you’re pissed, so you
Pout like a trout in a drought, can’t get out
You want to scream, but fish can’t shout
I’m five-foot-ten, so don’t wonder how
I’m the King of New York, just get down and bow

[Hook: MF Grimm and Samples]
[MF Grimm]
Let the King do his thing, don’t give me no hassle
The streets is my throne, New York is my castle
Some come close, but they can’t get it right ‘cause I’m

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
I’ll pull
Triggers on hard-head niggas, I’m leaving dents
Climb motherfuckers like a schoolyard fence
A posse tried to jump me to get a good rep
Fine, that’s why the TEC-9 is always kept
Sixteen shots, sixteen niggas hurt
Sixteen stagger, sixteen hit the dirt
No hospital beds, coffins all instead ‘cause all
Sixteen shots went dead to the head
I can’t think about anything else (Nah, kid)
Just my family, and then I go for self (What would I do?)
In the streets, it’s hard, but, in jail, it’s even
Tougher—that’s when shit get rougher
So I stay far away, no horseplay
I’ll stray from negativity and I’ll wait for my payday
Play basketball to let time pass, but
To let a nigga know, once in a while, I kick some ass
If I go Sioux and have beef with a crew
(Boh, boh!) He’s dead, (Boh, boh!) the dog too
Main maniac of all maniacs in Manhattan
Step on the sidewalk, and suckers start scatting
Respect with a TEC, I get my money with a MAC, a
.380 infrared light is exactly what I pack ‘cause I’m
The King

[Verse 3: MF Grimm]
I had it hard, but I took it in stride
I did a lot of bad shit, then I had to hide
The messenger of death killing rappers and lovers
All the brothers get smothered, also mothers under covers
To get paid was the reason (Gotta make that dough)
From murder the treason, it depended on the season
‘Cause I did all types of shit.  I murdered
Niggas for free, and also contract hits
I’ll specialize in hand-to-hand combat
More street fights than a motherfucking alley cat
As I bash your head, I’ll laugh at ya (Hahaha)
The baddest little nigga since Shaft in Africa
I’m not peaceful like Desmond Tutu, I’ll drink
Blood like it’s Yoo-Hoo, I kill like Shaka Zulu
There’s three rules I live by, boy, and that’s
Crush, Kill, Destroy (Motherfucker)

The King do his thing, don’t give me no hassle
