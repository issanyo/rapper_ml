Superstar Jet Jaguar - “Dancin’”
[Emcee(s): Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
[Producer(s): J-Zone]
[Scratches: J-Zone]

[Intro: Sample with Scratches by J-Zone]
“There is a story breaking here in the New York City area early in the morning, of which many of you around the country may not yet be aware”

[Verse 1: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
Started out a scheme
To have fun while we got cream.  With A-Alikes
Loops and mics, together a team.  Move
Units like majors, push weight in the streets.  Jet
Jag, J-Zone, PMD, Fat Beats
We touch records, then we spit out a story
We press it up and then we take the inventory
Our whole intention is to take your territory
Too late.  We just took your territory
We hit them with a sample, let them smoke the rhyme
Or white-label it for those who white-line
Vinyl junkies take this straight in the vein
They say to scratch it up ‘cause it really kills the pain
We could set it, compact or DVD it
You could download it, burn it, MP3 it
We sell it all, hip hop to rock ‘n’ roll
But once served, keep it moving—nigga, cop then go
Nothing personal, but cops will stop the flow
Independently, we accumulate the dough
FCC always be on me.  I make
Microphone fiends OD off me

[Hook: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm) and Samples with Scratches by J-Zone]

Everybody knows that music is nothing but
A drug

No time to play around when distributing

Make the deal and drop it off, then we bounce to
The club
[Samples with Scratches by J-Zone]
“Ready?”
“Do-si-do”

[Verse 2: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
That’s
Exactly who they try to stop: those who see dough
They tried to hit the cartel with a charge of RICO
Record Innovations, Currency Operations
If found guilty, natural life is what we’re facing
Zone got kingpin charges for all the bass, me for
Murder, spitting verses in the undercover’s face
They brought teams with infrared beams like I’m Pablo
Once again, The Downfall of Diablo
Spend some dough, take it to trial, make ‘em prove it
Meanwhile, overseas product—yes, we move it
Feds intercept—don’t stress it.  Yes, we’re fixing
Limited edition, J-Zone remixing
Switch barcodes ‘cause they watch SoundScan, open
Record stores in the Cayman or Switzerlands
Product we drop (I thought I told you that we won’t stop)
