[Hook]
Runaway with me
We could be free
If you don't know
Then let me show you how it should be

Take of to promise land

[Verse 1]
The retches of the earth
Flesh, bone and blood
We're enslaved on this ball of mud
Standing on the corner
Screaming i'm bitter
Civil disobedience
A poor man's twitter
Think like Socrates
Question whats made
They mock then offer him
Lock and gatorade
Prepare combat
Eternal war
Wheelchair
Spook coup sat by the door
Those who dream of harmony
Can't disturb harmony
Hem up word play
Hip Hop Hemingway
Sold saved
I'm not a slave

[Hook]
Runaway with me
We could be free
If you don't know
Then let me show you how it should be

Take of to promise land

[Outro]
Vietnam
