[Emcee(s): MeccaGodZilla (AKA RAVAGE), Gabarah (AKA junclassic), Gamma-Ra (AKA Majesty), Monsta X, Destroyah (AKA MF MEZ), and Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA MF Grimm)]
[Producer(s): The Architech]

[Intro: MeccaGodZilla (AKA RAVAGE)]
Yeah, M.I.C.  Come on.  Yo

[Verse 1: MeccaGodZilla (AKA RAVAGE)]
Sight
Beyond sight.  What?  The Czars in the zone
[?] MeccaGodZilla does, now you know
Determination to control the globe with antics like
Rodman in the post, come hypnotic through the microphone

[Verse 2: Gabarah (AKA junclassic)]
Furnace the law and I’ma service your jaw, fighting
Like Jackie Chan in a furniture store, use
Everything and anything against you, twist your fucking
Dental like a pretzel, put a pencil through your temple

[Verse 3: Gamma-Ra (AKA Majesty)]
Majesty mic-mangler—fuck, I said that
Gamma-Ra damage and bandage ya with a headwrap
Stupid, foolish, leave you toothless with a chew stick
These clueless new kids questioning who the group is
We’re far from the averages, savageness in excess
We’re the Yankees—the lineup changed but it’s the best yet
Leave palladium stadium all in astonishment
Monsta Isle separate your brain from its consciousness

[Verse 4: Monsta X]
Yo
This you could fuck with X?  Might as well fuck with X
Catch me out in London, blowing weed off the double-deck
Bus, yup, plus I got knuckles for these suckers
Plus we bust.  You must be smoking dust if you wanna touch us
Twist with the hand, you’ll see the Island swarming while your
Lone pistol jam like Michael Jackson and Jordan
Life of how you’re balling, it’s like the action is calling
Why you think we run the streets at night, don’t come back ‘til the morning?

[Verse 5: Destroyah (AKA MF MEZ)]
Yeah.  Yo
Monsta Island’s hottest fires spark and popping liars’ hearts
On target, shot ‘em through the wire and I stop it
You’re not as nice as Monstas boxing Godzilla, stomp him, knock him
Out, and watch him dying on the ground unconscious

[Verse 6: MeccaGodZilla (AKA RAVAGE)]
Czars
Got that Dominique Dawes, no homo, melanin charge
Ability: flip and land on our feet against all odds, defeat
The Beast, plan strategically, synaptic charge and take the helmet
Off, silverback with alpha males getting retarded

[Verse 7: Gabarah (AKA junclassic)]
The only thing special ‘bout you is your education
You seeing me is like blacks seeing reparations
Shit, I’m out of reach, fam, fly without a wingspan
While you’re stuck like an infant trying to run in beach sand

[Verse 8: Destroyah (AKA MF MEZ)]
Yeah.  Uh
Smashing tracks, we’re bashing, Monsta mashing, rapping, doing graff
And breakdancing, handstanding off a backspin
Peace to all the Monsta masses.  We’re expanding ‘til we reach
The maximum capacity upon the planet.  Grandmaster Grimm

[Verse 9: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA MF Grimm)]
Grimm, the money-stacker, heat-packer
Still packing, nigga, still stacking
Still macking, jaws still cracking
Still jacking, laws still breaking
Still taking lives, crews shaking
Niggas want war with us but really faking
M.I.C., we stomp, the earth quaking
Bang heads with Monstas, left aching

[Hook: Gamma-Ra (AKA Majesty)]
Sight
Beyond sight (What?!?), Monstas in the zone
Hyper for the fight, strike with a poem
Sight beyond light (What?!?), speed like a prism
M-I-to-the-C, seeds in the system
