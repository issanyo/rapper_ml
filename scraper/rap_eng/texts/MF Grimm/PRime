[Chorus: Zeneith]
It's the average catastrophe, a little rationality that limits our reality
So listen to my strategy, avoid local tragedy, its gravity,(floating)
Breathe a little gravity, feel a little gravity
It's the average catastrophe, a little rationality that limits our reality
So listen to my strategy, avoid local tragedy, its gravity,(floating)
Breathe a little gravity, feel a little gravity

[Verse 1: Zeneith]
Floating, hoping for a lucid escape
Leaving the world in an iconic state
Leaving mouths shut without using tape
Segregation for the duration of a beloved cremation
Lucrative fugitive forced to mass create
Hope deflates, pupils dilate
Some how its called fate
Sparring with a body bag
Enemies waving the white flag
Fuck I'm gonna hash tag black flag
Twisted images reflect gifted vividness
Strictly liquid with a complex sentence
I'm way less privileged,words forever endless
They all fuckin' mean-less, I'm useless
Not the best student, everything's seen an illusion
Little influences modern improvement
Little steps; no movement
No amusement, just human stupidness (huh)
Rhymes more fluent than the English language
Verbal savage, habit filled passage
Overly challenged, lowered damage
Handled casket, battled advantage
Ghost and vantage, coincidentally managed
Heart bandaged, baby carriage held hostage then banished
Always the vanquish, enemy in anguish then I fuckin' vanish. (poof)

[Chorus 2: Zeneith]
It's the average catastrophe, a little rationality that limits our reality
So listen to my strategy, avoid local tragedy, its gravity,(floating)
Breathe a little gravity, feel a little gravity
It's the average catastrophe, a little rationality that limits our reality
So listen to my strategy, avoid local tragedy, its gravity,(floating)
Breathe a little gravity, feel a little gravity

[Verse 2: Zeneith]
I'm living in my worst enemies favorite planet
And HE can't stand it, hearts so cold that HE needs a blanket
Yet HE'S not granted, cause he's the biggest bandit
I mean who steals shit from a fuckin' casket
How the fuck is this bitch lasting
By next month I'm sure he'll be blasted
And his body will be the one in the casket
Pour a bottle of acid, tell me that's drastic
Locate your inner-activist and find some fuckin' passion bitch
Sucking dick isn't adequate or an accident
You're the devils advocate, you'll birth Satan Jr. on abstinence
Imagine the world as a nice place
People don't shoot or care about inter-race
That's where I go at night
Sometimes I get lost in my thoughts
Cause its nice to live with all ya got
So for all you passionless step kids
This rap gig, will make me your father fig (ure)
A gift so pure
Only thing not advertised in a fucking brochure
I got bros for sure, and I'm sure they'll assure me
It goes C to the P, no to the hoes
Even though they're clothed, they're bound to expose
Even though I'm poised, you'll see I'll explode
Leaking influenza, spitting sickness
Bloodier than Justin Biebers slit wrists
Take the business from the richest
Verbally equipped, I have my hand gripped
As the bomb ticks, Informing the little bitch
With tips from the script as I proceed to snip his little bitch lips
I crumple my fist in the midst, reaching sublime
Forced to coexist as I highlight life crimes in my fuckin' spare time
I feel remorse cause you'll never decode
Even if its slow mode you'll have to check my lymph nodes to see what raps owed
Walking down the middle of the road then to world froze
Fuck this put acid on my casket and watch me corrode

[Chorus: Zeneith]
It's the average catastrophe, a little rationality that limits our reality
So listen to my strategy, avoid local tragedy, its gravity,(floating)
Breathe a little gravity, feel a little gravity
It's the average catastrophe, a little rationality that limits our reality
So listen to my strategy, avoid local tragedy, its gravity,(floating)
Breathe a little gravity, feel a little gravity
