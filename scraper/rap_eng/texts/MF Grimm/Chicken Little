Jet Jaguar - “Chicken Little”
[Emcee(s): Jet Jaguar (AKA MF Grimm)]
[Producer(s): [?]]

[Verse 1: Jet Jaguar (AKA MF Grimm)]
Superstar Jet Jaguar, jig jugulars
Jabbing, stabbing knife-thrusting
Combust and dance, I hustle while
Feds tapping, bring noise like Savion
Set up shop, cash flow
Is avian, blood-
-line royalty, yes, blessed
Manhattan don, paper chase
Howl at paper moon
Pay-per-view, pay for me, pay for you
Pay the price.  I take them all
To war and seize their territory
March to your death, scream
“Charge,” and meet your glory, king-
-dom conquered sub-
-jects adore me, so no
Matter the distance, foes put up
Little resistance.  They lost be-
-fore I touch ‘em.  Lessons
I teach ‘em.  Someone
Should have told ‘em, so now
I must tell ‘em.  New and
Clear, up I tear ‘em, get
‘Em all, none I fear.  Cowards
Turning in their tracks, drop
Their weapons, and they flee.  You will die
Don’t you know?  Don’t
Be messing ‘round with me.  Jet
Jaguar the great
Slayer of many men in
War—future:
I slay many more
Cook it up, got the block hot, flooded
With ready rock.  They’re fiending, doing any-
-thing for me
Addicted, so they’re scheming—the high is
Calling, the high
Is calling.  Music is a
Drug.  There’s no MF?  Then
The sky is falling
Cook it up, got the block hot, flooded
With ready rock.  They’re fiending, doing any-
-thing for me
Addicted, so they’re scheming—the high is
Calling, the high
Is calling.  Music is a
Drug.  There’s no MF?  Then
The sky is falling
