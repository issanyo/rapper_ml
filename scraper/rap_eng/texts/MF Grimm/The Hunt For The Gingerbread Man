[Intro]
Yeah, this is for all you crumb-ass niggas (crumbs, crumbs)

[MF Grimm]
Catch me if you can, I'm the gingerbread man
Beat murder cases while the jury still at grand
Dispose of the mold, yes I always keep a plan
In case I gotta chop up, cookie cutters in my hand
Burn, baby burn, keep a furnace on my land
I know hell is hot, I walk with a fan
That's the way the cookie crumbles so try to understand
I'm laughing while you stumble cause you rumble like a girl
If people were just humble, it would be a better world
Bring it, I got guns, fuck what you care
Talking like you pumping, nigga, I'm on to your scheme
Nigga, I know you glazed and your heart is Krispy Kreme
Cash rules everything around me
Assholes like you astound me
Brain infected, pretending you're a beast
When God created you, he added too much yeast
Whether internet gangster of cellphone thug
I will take your life and that's on everything I love
I take death serious, I don't love much
You must be delirious if you think you can't be touched
JFK in Texas caught one in the boulder
Even the Pope took one in the shoulder
So what you think so special about you (sucker)
I'm short of a loaf, half-baked as a crew
Divide and conquer, in half brake you
I'll ride out to die nigga, I'll take you
I'm quick to catch a body now in my old age
I've seen the mistakes that Carlito made
A young nigga'll kill you if you sleep and move slow
So wide 'em out, baby, block will got to go
Fiends nodded cause I got a mean flow
Show you what I'm made of, I'm bout the dough
I'm bout the dough, nigga

[Hook]
(I get money, money I got)
(And police couldn't touch me because I was payin 'em)
(But not with no money - Yo, I was frayin 'em)
(And that's the life, that I live)
(Got to get my motherfucking money right)
(So yeah, I'll stick a nigga most definite)
(Blast the black metal at you)
(Now it’s like motherfucking Vietnam)

[MF Grimm]
Gingy, money stacker, heat packer
Bleach flour, try to stay away from crackers
Saltine even, if they graham
Animals around courts of mayhem
Some animals perpetuate 'em like they Ritz
Man, fuck the crackers, they don't mean shit
Half-bakes doing hits
Half-bakes doing hits
Pillsbury dope boy, he will meet defeat
I murdered Cookie Monster in the middle of the street
Rob Keebler Elves, we ran up in their tree
We had to kill them all, witnesses you never leave
Swimming in the cookie dough, we got the motherload
Putwork on the block, gingerbread, it;s time to flow
Cookie Jarvis had the block, we took him out of there
Lost all of his magic, he didn't want to share
He had the Cookie Crook shook, Jarvis was a faker
So we returned him to his baker (gunshots)

That's right, his baker
All mighty baker
