[Intro: MF Grimm]
I gotta get out of here.  I gotta get the fuck out of here.  DOOM, I gotta get the fuck out, bro.  The fuck out of here.  I stole your girl while you was in prison

[Bridge 1: Sample from Milk Dee on Audio Two - “Top Billin’”]
I get money, money I got
Stunts call me honey if they feel real hot
That's how it is—you can ask Giz
I stole your girl while you were in prison

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Will I
See you again? (See you again, love)  I’m facing life, love
Sitting in the pen (Sitting in the pen, love), jail, no mail, so
I don’t know when (I don’t know when, love) we’ll be together
But until then (Until then, love), I lay in my cell and
I think about you (Think about you), my freedom
The things I want to do (Things I want to do, love).  I work out, wait
For you to come home (For you to come home), halt downslide
Time on the phone (On the phone, love).  “Hello, what’s up?”
So much you want to say (Say it, love).  I listen to you as you
Talk about your day (Talk about your day, love).  I thank the Lord that
You picked me as your man (Me as your man, love), but if you can’t stick
By, I understand (I understand, love).  Do your thing.  You got
One life to live (One life to live, love).  Pure love is
All that you give (All that you give, love).  I’m stressed out today and
Fucked up in the head (Fucked up in my head, love), thinking about what
Milk Dee said (I stole your girl while you was in prison)

[Hook: Sample from Milk Dee on Audio Two - “Top Billin’”]
I stole your girl while you were in prison

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Incarceration blues, locked up, front
Page on the news.  Fucked up ‘cause
I’m thinking about you, staring at your picture
Wishing I was with ya.  Will I
See you again?  Are you loyal?  Are you
With other men?  Life’s hard, yeah
The things we’re going through.  Together, hold me down, love
And I’ll hold you (Hold you, hold you)
I miss you so much (So much, love).  Back to lockdown
I’ll call you after lunch (Call you after lunch, love).  Confirm visits
So you I can touch (I can touch, love), kiss you softly
Make me feel free (Feel free, love), smell your perfume
Hear you love me.  Obviously, I picked a winner
Mafia love from birth and a sinner
Burn eternal, me you touch from inner
Time’s up, love.  I’ll call you after dinner
Back to lockdown

[Interlude 1: MF Grimm]
Every time.  Every time I turn around, love

[Verse 3: MF Grimm]
Dreams
Of picnics in the park (In the park, love).  Lights out now
Writing in the dark (In the dark, love).  I’m stressed out tonight and
Fucked up in the head (Fucked up in my head, love), thinking about what
Milk Dee said (I stole your girl while you was in prison)
Incarceration blues, locked up, front
Page on the news.  Fucked up ‘cause
I’m thinking about you, staring at your picture
Wishing I was with ya.  Will I
See you again?  Are you loyal?  Are you
With other men?  Life’s hard, yeah
The things we’re going through.  Together, hold me down, love
And I’ll hold you (Hold you, hold you)

[Interlude 2: MF Grimm]
Uh, uh.  Yeah.  When I talk to you, I’m back around again.  I stole your girl while you was in prison

[Hook: Sample from Milk Dee on Audio Two - “Top Billin’”]
