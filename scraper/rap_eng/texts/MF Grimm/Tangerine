[Verse 1]
I been trying not to murder
I'll probably end up getting murder
Put my heart in to my music
Unfortunatly my poor heart murmured
Born to take hip hop further
Why bother no ones listening
Eagle antiseptic
Burn like listerine
Release libertine
Like histamines
Man on fire through the gasoline
Mental exercise
On the trampoline
Fresh produce
Manage, make the green
Life gives you lemons
Barter for tangerines


Is this the part you take my heart
To wipe your feet on

I've been lied to, betrayed and cheated on

I've been shot
I've been stabbed
I've been beat on
