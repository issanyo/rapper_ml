"You don't know nothing do you?
That's the beauty of gold
It never tarnishes
Lasts forever, too
You can melt it down, pound it, twist it, piss on it
But it's always the same gold
It was here long before we were and it'll be here a long time after we're gone
I bet you a lot of men have died for the gold that's just in this one piece"

[Verse 1]
If you cry under fire then you wasn't built for war
If a pimp take you girl then your girl was never yours
Mental kickboxer, still test jaws
I'm Grandmaster, Grimm Reaper
Feds snooping at door like Mr. Roper
Monitored cause talented like Mr. Ripley
State frustrated, hated, can't get me
The Gingerbread Man but for short call me Gingy
Suicidal, jump right in a glass of milk
I'm made of dough so watch a nigga swell
I could never fall apart cause mad is the flow
You could never ever take my crown, I'll kill you at a show
Hit stars with guns, make 'em see stars
Hit cops with dum-dums, trying to be smart
Gotta lay him down, didn't know he was a narc
Gingerbread man but I have a stone heart
Payback extortion from fraternal order
Informant sent letter to D.A. with tracing paper
With invisible ink, trapped in magic library
I wanna scream but it's a secret indictment
Judge whistle Dixie from excitement
The law is a lefty, so where the rights went?
Pain on display for world like David Blaine
True crime stories but they think I entertain

A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money, I want the money, I want the money

[Verse 2]
Are you down with so and so?
What's your gimmick?
Nothing, my life is lyrics so I spit it
When murder is something that you become accustomed to
Taking a life just don't fuck with you
House niggas faceless, buried in field of potters
Field niggas found shelter, now squatters
If eyes are the window to soul, then why am I squinting?
My face is on the money that I'm printing, strike a pose
Wanna take life, strike my foes
I rolled through Hell and it froze
My halo got burnt but it still glows
I'm not on my feet but I stay on my toes
If we ain't cool then that's the way it goes
Forget all the kid shit fucking with a grown man
Niggas running around fantasizing like they're Peter Pan
Your life's a scam and I'mma fuck it up like Neverland

A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money fuck the fame
A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream
I want the money, I want the money, I want the money

All that other shit is overrated
I want the money
Cash

"I don't know what this stuff is anymore
God's gold, our gold, fool's gold
What we can do is take as many of them as we can and hope for the best"
"What about trading the gold to 'em for our safety?"
"They'd kill us anyway
I would if I was them
Truth is Vince I don't see any way we're gonna get out of here quiet"

A man with a dream with plans to make cream, cream, cream, cream cream
