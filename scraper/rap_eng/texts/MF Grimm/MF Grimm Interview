[Interviewer and GM Grimm]
Interviewer: When did Percy Carey take on the title “MF Grimm,” and how, how did this come about?
GM Grimm: Man, that’s a good question, um.  Actually, it was, it was always, um, Grimm Reaper
Interviewer: Really?

And, um, it was “Build and Destroy, The Grimm Reaper,” but everyone just started calling me “Grimm Reaper.”  And, um, the “MF,” I added that on just because, um, out in, my boys out, like, on the West Coast, they always said that, you know, “Yo, you got Mad Flows, man, you could, you could, you could flow to anything.  You could flow to anything.”  Um, so I just kept it—“MF.”  Just “Grimm Reaper.”  Also, “Motherfucking Reaper”—excuse my language—but that’s what it is, you know, so...
Interviewer: Yeah.  I read, I read...
