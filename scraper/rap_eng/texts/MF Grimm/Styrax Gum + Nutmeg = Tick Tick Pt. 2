[Intro: MF Grimm]
Welcome back to the rollercoaster ride.  Now please fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride.  Thank you

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
I’m Mad Flow.  Challenge me, it’s costly
Some rappers shine, MF is pure glossy
Lyrics light in the ass, you can’t toss me
MF Grimm back to show who the boss be
Emergency state.  In my head, I hear voices
Some agree with me, some scold my choices
Reality crack the pieces—try to fix it, but ain’t the same
Back to basic fundamentals of the rap game.  Don’t
Give a fuck who you are, put that ass to shame
Tore you graffiti style, destroy your fucking name
Old-school, new-school, the one you like, you choose
Makes me no different—both them get abused
Disgusted old-school rappers fuss, rhymes shows debris
Of rust.  They tried but they can’t keep up with us
New-school rappers fail.  They rhyme about
Crack sales and shoot-outs, but all that shit is DuckTales
Mad Flows always prevail
Been shot, sold drugs, even went to jail
Downfall of Ibliys: Ghetto Opera made on bail
“What A Niggy Know? (Remix),” all hail
MF Mad Fresh, the rest is all stale
DOOM pounding out beats, sipping on ale
Room starts spinning, now you’re frail and you’re pale
Died dizzy in your coffin, I hammered nails

[Interlude 1: MF Grimm]
Welcome back to the rollercoaster ride.  And now we...

[Hook (Overlapped with Interlude 2): MF Grimm]
Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Finger feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat it up
Slow it up, speed it up, speed it even faster
Slow it down all the way.  MF is the master
Punch out, punch in, double up the drums
MF Grimm, MF DOOM, tick, tick, boom!

[Interlude 2 (Overlapped with Hook): MF Grimm]
Keep it going.  Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  Uh.  One

[Outro: MF Grimm]
We’re not done.  This will never end.  Hope you enjoyed your ride.  Now please fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ride.  Thank you.  Metal Face, Day By Day.  We don’t stop.  We don’t stop.  Uh, we don’t stop.  Special Herbs + Spices
