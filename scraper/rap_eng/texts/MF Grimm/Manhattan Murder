F5
Day by Day

[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
We don't give a fuck about your label or distribution
Put a gun to yo' CEO head, then we shootin'
You niggas talk a lot about money, but you just yappin'
Money makin' is our name here, we're from Manhattan
Money makin' is our fame here, we made millions
Can't talk about millions, without there being some killings
Real stories, real bodies, real blood spillin'
Kidnap, kid snatch, niggas chop they childen
Street wars niggas murder, 'cause of drug dealin'
Take yo' life in front of yo' family word, fuck they feelings
A lyricist with his pen, I stab him until he's dead
If he freestyle, then I punch him in fuckin' head
So while he's bleedin', we'll see if he can concentrate
With a fractured skull, can he keep his thoughts straight?
On the cell phone you scared, oh you callin' 'em?
You better have a bus, you gonna need all of 'em
You cannot fuck with Grimm

[Verse 2: MF Mez]
Yeah
I flip it, I rip it, [the ripper that spitted it?]
In less than a second, a minute, I'm wreckin'
I'm wreckin ya section, whenever the weapons
Is spittin with heavy am-mu-nition
I wet up your set, an I'm dippin'
You said that you better than Mez?, you better be kiddin'
Whether it's melody steady on rhythm
Or whether you get a street medal, we rippin'
Whether we [just done the kicks an the fist in the head?]
And you better be ready to lose, or ready to move
Out of the way, we ready to do, whatever you ready to do
You petty, a peasant I'm better than you
I'm dead-a-ly, severe ya' head [?]
Scared of me, nobody's safe
Industry dudes can get it too
Manhattans murderin' bastards, [worse you get captured?]
[bodied then hidden in plaster, bodied?] with shottys I blast ya
Smack ya' [mom?], crack ya' [mind?] backwards
