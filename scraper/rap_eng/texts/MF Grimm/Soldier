-- Intro --
This is a soldier’s anthem
All soldiers from the street general

-- Chorus --
I marched through the hellfire
I ignored burns like a soldier
I showed no weakness in hellfire
Mind over matter, much colder
Demon’s got guns in the hellfire
Thirsty for blood in the hellfire
Feel like torture never done
Revolution, hellfire, hotter than the sun

-- Verse  -- Mf grimm
Mind over matter
I’m the one
Break through, make things new, that’s what I do
I marched through the hellfire
Come on
Save the babies
Glory
We move forward
Confront obstacles
Who died today
Gunsmoke
Living under fire
Basement hell
Living under fire
Now we raise hell
Return fire
Advance mission
Apply more pressure
Wishing death, yes
Waiting
*Smash ya
Gunshot
Touch ya
*Tesha
Teach ya
Tought ya
Tought ya
Ignited
Tolerated
Pay’s overrated
Brain override it
We’ll powerfight it
Anthem - Recite it
Act as one
We must move united
Slow it up, speed it up
Walk the path of jesus
I marched through hell
While it freezes

-- Chorus --
I marched through the hellfire
I ignore burns like a soldier
I show no weakness in hellfire
Mind over matter much colder
Flesh melts off in the hellfire
Bones turned to dust in the hellfire
Feel like torture never done
Revolution, hellfire, hotter than the sun
Uh
Hellfire, hotter than the sun

-- Talking --
This is dedicated to the babies trapped in hell
Told they could never change the circumstances
You can change your life, don’t let anyone tell you you can’t make it
You can be anything you wanna be
You feel like you can’t take it no more
Can you travel within yourself
And you keep marching forward
Keep marching through
Never give up
You are future
You are the difference
You are paradise
And to secure paradise

-- Chorus --
I march through the hellfire
I ignore burns like a soldier
I show no weakness in hellfire
Mind over matter much colder
Demon’s got guns in the hellfire
Thirsty for blood in the hellfire
Feel like torture never done
Revolution hellfire hotter than the sun
Mind over matter, I’m the one
Break through make things new that’s what I do
I marched through the hellfire

-- Outro --
I stride
Left, right (*3)
No retreat, no surrender. (*2)
Hell on earth...
