Born in America, land of the free
For the right price that's how it will be
I know my existence is really political
Slipped through the cracks from the era selling crack
Murders, put in jail, still didn't crack
Shot up, paralyzed, bullet in my back
Brain power, made dough, it didn't hold me back
Pain's joy, hit song, didn't hold back
It rained blood, can't front, didn't hold back
Last meal, dinner served, didn't hold back
About to leave music, film is where it's at
Plus radio suckas never play me
FCC listens and wanna slay me
If you want Hot 97, don't save me
No pay, no luck, so they hate me
The DJs are scared and they motherfucking shaky
The white people who own it, they act real snakey
I dwell in the underground; the fan base will make me
Fuck commercial radio, they can't break me
Shots fired, God had to kill me to awake me
I learn patience as I wait for him to take me
I learn patience as I wait for him to take me
As I learn about life I get stronger
Thanks for getting American Hunger
