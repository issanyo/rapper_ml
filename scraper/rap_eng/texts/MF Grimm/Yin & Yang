When I make
Love with you, baby
You take me
To paradise
When I’m at
War with you, baby
It makes me
Just want to die
Things we go through while in
Love and war (Yin and yang)
We’re balanced right
We are too strong.  We
Proved them wrong (Yin and yang)
We’re balanced right

[Verse 1: Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm)]
You’re not with the street, you won’t let me hustle
You’re right by my side and you’re down for my struggle
Materialistic things don’t really mean nothing to you
I still want to get it for you ‘cause you mean the world to me
In love with ya.  Women all around jealous, baby
Men scheming on me ‘cause they really want to take you, baby
It’s obvious you’re beautiful.  Holler at you sideways
Do it all they want ‘cause they can’t love you my way
Women know my situation, but they’re kind of curious
Some step across the line, it gets you kind of furious
I get the same way, I know you’re understanding this
People want to break us up—how we gonna handle this?
Men are from Mars, women are from Venus
One world, one love, nothing get between us
This is to the death—we both know we mean this
That’s my... this is your...
We fight sometime, expressing how we feel
But we both know that this is real
I want to give you the world, so I get mad
‘Cause this song’s all I have

[Hook: Su-Ann Ortiz and (Superstar Jet Jaguar (AKA GM Grimm/MF Grimm))]

Love with you, baby

To paradise

War with you, baby
It makes me
Just want to die
Things we go through while in
Love and war (Yin and yang)
(Still) We’re balanced right
We are too strong.  We
Proved them wrong (Yin and yang)
We’re balanced right

[Interlude: Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
Yo, man, let ‘em know, man

[Verse 2: Agu Obiakor (AKA Mr. Voodoo)]
Yo, I ain’t
Afraid to tell you I love you like a cooked vege-
-table even though I’m a crook and a rebel.  I know you’re
Looking to settle, but I roll like a pebble, but now
My fear is your friends just looking to meddle, they’re like
“Cut him off—that’ll end suspicions over him
All you do is fight bitches in the street over him,” but you know
You ain’t even gotta compete over him.  All your
Friends just mad ‘cause I don’t sleep, I see the ho in them.  I’m like
A dark cloud, you sort of glow within.  Grimy but
The shine you see in me make ‘em, “Why she go with him?”
Pants hanging low with Timbs, tats and all
Du-rag, fitted hats and all, gats and all
Listening to Meth and Mary J., that was yours and my
Favorite joint ‘cause “All We Need” was us to get by.  Thought
I was crazy when I told you nothing was sweet, sleep
With a shank in the pillow, gun under the sheet.  Flash
To the burner, I laughed when I hurt her ass if
I murdered—told her I’d walk that path no further, but
Word bond (And that’s my word), me with a burner turned
Her on like she was watching hardcore porn.  You told me
If anyone fucked with this, you was blazing them joints
You ain’t got to tell me that—here’s a case in point: remember
That day we argued and some dumb nigga got in
Between, and we wound up jumping that nigga—how real
Is that?

[Outro]
“Reporting.  The robot is at the lake.  All is ready”
“Well done”
“The inventor will be there soon.  He’s on his way now with a brother”
“Excellent.  Our elevators are already moving upwards, and we’ll emerge from the crack of the lakebed”
