[Intro]
Well I man come to tell them
Want them already not go on them again
The masters in full effect homeboy
Right

[Hook]
We're gonna rock with the masters (Mmmhmm)
'Cause they drive us crazy (La la la la la la la la)
We're gonna rock with the masters (Oooh wee)
'Cause they drive us crazy (La la la la la la la)
The masters are the top because
They rock that fly hip hop
And we don't stop, the beat don't stop

[Bridge]
(Shabazz) We're gonna do it again, we're gonna do it again
We're gonna do it again (With Doctor)
We're gonna do it again, we're gonna do it again
We're gonna do it again (A diddly Don)
We're gonna do it again, we're gonna do it again
We're gonna do it again
We're gonna do it again, we're gonna do it again
We're gonna do it again (Maxwell)

[Verse 1]
Well we think it's time, and you think it's time
That we bust a rhyme
Masters Of Ceremony is back on the chart, tearin' shit apart
Now here we go, we're gonna twist this one
I know you missed this one
But don't you ever try to diss this one
It's somethin' to make you shake to this
And you got to twist, you can't resist, uh, bust this!
Sound to make you want to do what you want to
I wanna do what you want to
'Cause I know you really miss, but someone named
Red Alert said, we can do this
Masters of disasters, honey, can't you tell?
The code of hold on this episode is Pu Maxwell
Just swing it like Mcgillibutter, we and A supreme
Din is the black man, so bust a grape
I'm on the tip top, so put the mouth on the ziploc
Masters are comin' out of the block

[Hook]
We're gonna rock with the masters (Mmmhmm)
'Cause they drive us crazy (La la la la la la la la)
We're gonna rock with the masters (Oooh wee)
'Cause they drive us crazy (La la la la la la la)
The masters are the top because
They rock that fly hip hop
And we don't stop, the beat don't stop (TLD)

[Verse 2]
The beat is kickin', Doctor Who is set
Levels adjusted to my voice to make y'all sweat
So dance and feel the heat, dance and move your feet
As we're rockin' and rhymin' to the beat
A rhythm that will get you up, and say "Yup Yup!"
It ain't coffee or tea, but your favorite
Cup of hip hop, drink and don't stop
Jerkin' your whole body as we rock to the tip top
Swing to this and do your thing to this
Masters Of Ceremony will bring to this
Another hip powered zipple that will always flow
To your ears, your feet feel it so you can't say no
(Do it again, do it again, do it again)

[Hook]
We're gonna rock with the masters (Ooh wee)
'Cause they drive us crazy (La la la la la la la)
We're gonna rock with the masters (I'm chillin')
'Cause they drive us crazy
The masters are the top because
They rock that fly hip hop
And we don't stop, the beat don't stop

[Verse]
Well give me the beat, I want to free my soul
I wanna fill my heart with the rock and roll
Yo man, I drift away, under diddly diddly diddly man
Drift away, full of dreadlocks
Name iddly iddly iddly iddly clump all night
Now that I'm really chillin', I'm on top of the mic
And just settin' it up, settin' it up
Don't make me count to ten, way, well easy now
We're comin' on 'em again, I'm gonna tell them again
I'm gonna warn 'em again, I'm gonna tell them again
And them nice like me, hey, they like me
They like me, hey, they like me
'Cause I'm a Duracell and you're and Eveready
I last third the day, but you only last three
When the kid is done I throw 'em away like bad tree
He's an alternatin' current, I am not a DC
He's a singer, I'm a shocker, so I bum styly
The D here up on the mic, now Don Baron, there see
Them are nice like me, hey, say like me
Ace, they like me, hey, they like me, so

[Hook]
We're gonna rock with the masters
'Cause they drive us crazy
We're gonna rock with the masters
'Cause they drive us crazy
The masters are the top because
They rock that fly hip hop
And we don't stop, the beat don't stop

[Outro]
We're gonna rock with the masters, 'cause
We're gonna rock with the masters, 'cause
The masters are the top because
They rock that fly hip hop
And we don't stop, the beat don't stop
We're gonna rock with the masters
'Cause they drive us crazy
