[Verse 1:]
I love you
I love you
Honey, I love you, I do
More than you'll ever know
It's for sure
You can always count on my love
Forever more
I need you
I need you
Baby, I need you so bad
Say, can you understand
You're my man
You can always count on my love
Forever more

[Pre-Chorus:]
Baby, when we
When we're together
Say I'm alright and you're alright
It's like paradise
I just want you to know how I feel
How I feel

[Chorus:]
Love and need and want you babe
I love and need and want you baby, I
Love and need and want you babe
I love and need and want you baby, I
Love and need and want you babe
I love and need and want you baby, I
Love and need and want you babe
I love and need and want you baby, I

Love, I need, I want you
Love, I need, I want you

Don't you know I love you?
Need and want you?

[Verse 2:]
I want you
I want you
Sugar, I want you so bad
I got a burning desire
My soul's on fire
Can't you see
You are my everything

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] (2x)

Love, I need, I want you
(I love, I need, I want)
Love, I need, I want you
(Don't you know I love you?
Love, I need, I want you?)
