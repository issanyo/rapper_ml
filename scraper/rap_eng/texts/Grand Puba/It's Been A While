[Intro]
Blessing grand puba dem
Respect eh!
Everytime

[Hook]
It’s been awhile since you heard grand puba
Lord knows murda dem murda dem
That’s what happen when the god touch the pen
Not shabba rank but I rank top ten
Only know one way to play that’s to win
If it’s about business then count me in
If it’s no paper it’s a miscount then
Godfather sliding through with ease
Shots a gun then I roll up my sleeve
Find a hot joint then I put her on leave
One request no fake ass tities or weave
Allergic to the fake shit I keep a hunnid on me
Then I make it rain cause ma nick name sunny money
Cause I believe the children are the future
Teach them well and help them lead the way
Show em all the beauty they possess inside
Give them that knowledge of self to make it
To make it easier
Let them children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Kings and Queens not hoes and fiends
Don’t believe everything you see upon the screens
Nowadays it’s seems that it’s all about the greens
But it don’t mean a thing with the red and black in between

[Hook]
It’s been awhile since you heard grand puba
Lord knows
It’s been awhile since you heard grand puba
It’s been awhile since you heard grand puba

[Verse 2]
If you want it come get it cause I got
Trust me god I'm only getting started
Turn up I never do it half hearted
Me and this beat related cause this joint came out retarded
I'm a New York fellow laid back and mellow
That’s why I rock the seven knowledge knowledge  eleven
So, check the bill come get your head filled
It’s been a long time
See you people just don’t get it
I never mind them critics, media, blog haters even dopefiend did it
Come on people hate cause I keep it retro
But like them joints that I drop look how fast my shit go

[Hook]
It’s been awhile since you heard grand puba ay
Lord knows Lord God knows
It’s been awhile since you heard grand puba ay
You know I know u dont know what we know

[Outro]
Some people try to say we’re crazy
Destructive, ignorant and lazy
Waste money on foolish things
Forget trouble he’s a slave
We come from kings and queens
So peace to the god peace to the earth
SI as I travel to through the whole universe
[?] happy time since [?] each other


It’s been a long long long long time
You don’t know what we know
