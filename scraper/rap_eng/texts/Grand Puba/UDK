[Intro]
Ha ha, word, yeah
You know what it is
Niggas out here cooning, buffooning (go Puba, go Puba)
Selling their soul
They know what it is, let’s go ya’ll

[Verse 1]
This chick try to hit me with some [?] with a weave
I told her keep an eye to her like Adam Eve
Cause nowadays it just seems like it’s Adam and Steve
And if it’s like that tell me how you gon’ conceive
Cause nowadays some of these chicks done really lost their minds (lost their mind)
Tampering with one body part at a time
Niggas tryin to me that’s just the sign of the times
No it’s not mami, who’s your doctor? Frankenstein?
This shit be lookin crazy when I step inside the party (yeah)
What they doing to the food, you doing to your body
Niggas spiced up, came through to the T (yeah)
Shit is getting crazy or maybe it’s me
The preacher doing nothing while they killing off our young (word)
The same way that they used to do when we was getting hung (word)
They tell you calm down but they ain’t gon’ do a thing (word)
But I bet you they on point when they coming for offering, ka-ching
Yeah shit just got real
Ever wonder why so many of us in jail
Steal a nigga purpose so you know we born to fail
Tryna turn my seed into release of the monkey cycle
Yeah these niggas the images they show
Got you looking like that, they’ll do anything for dough
Thinking you on top until it’s time for you to go
Don’t believe me?
Take a look at what they doing to Huxtable (word, that shit crazy)

[Hook]
Cause you don’t know
You don’t know what they’re doing to you
Cause you don’t know
See you don’t know
You don’t know
(yeah now it’s just the melanin)
Ain’t nothing but that melanin

[Verse 2]
See I love your body and your skintone
No need to be at the beach cause you was born with a tan
That’s why they hating on me cause I be the original man
You trying to be like them while they trying to be like you
Treating us like animals, we just in a bigger zoo
And they hate it cause I be heavily melanated
Pus it also mean with the universe I’m related
See I’m so serious, I don’t believe in no mysterious
Keep it right and there’s that
We only dealing with some actual facts (I told ya’ll)
Pull the tree from the youths then they kill off the fruits
Here in the concrete jungle rocking tumbling boots
Yelling “Black Lives Matter. Hands up, don’t shoot!”
Niggas selling out to be the devil’s prostitute (word)
I’m done, a dog can’t live amongst the devil
I’m a whole different species on a whole different level
I’m the original man, universe made
When the sun coming we ain’t gotta run and find shade
Not that type of dude to sell my soul to get paid
Watch me shut these parasites down like I’m Blade (word, that shit’s crazy)

[Hook]
Cause you don’t know
You don’t know what they’re doing to you
They killing you
You don’t know
You don’t know
