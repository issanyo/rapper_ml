Listen up money or should I say honey
Listen up money or should I say honey

[Phife]
In the beginning there was Adam and Eve
But some try to make it look like Adam and Steve
Like Georgie, why can't money find a honey
I couldn't believe when I found out he was funny
You know fierce with just his right ear pierced
I couldn't hack it, I knew this brother for years
Walking in the ville with them long dreadlocks
But on the DL, getting done up the butt box
Oh my God how gross can one be
Well anyway, better him than me
Used to be down with the crew and had the girls that were def
Instead of staying to the right, he fell off to the left
So Lord J being that you go next
Pull the rest of his card cause I'm vexed

[Lord Jamar]
My man George got a germ that's ill
Suffering from terminal scag
But never ever getting caught walking like a fag
That's not his bag cause the plague was afraid to parade in drag
So instead he played the DL, brothers get jel
Cause honey's on his dick but money won't swell
He'd rather call Manuel for a little duel
Have a swordfight with tools
He's wounded and I can't understand
Why a man would want to be a weak cipher man
I thought the plan was to be hard as a rock
Not riding a jock, sucking on a cock

[Hook x2]

[Grand Puba]
My man George I thought he was on base
Find out later that he was a closet case
Woah woah he's a sweet thing
George was down with the titty titty bang bang
Now George swung with gays, just the way he sways
Even fooled around with his mom's lingerie
Come get it girl, something fierce was his line
Even wore a dress and on his face he had swine
He cipher monkey cipher, you fucking faggot
Couldn't wait for gay parade so you can drag it
George used to flip, went from hitting skins to sucking nigga's dick
George better get a grip

[Sadat X]
Now Georgie used to run with the ill brothers
Kids who liked to rob mothers, and do a bunch of crazy things
He had the ladies, a baby, a shiny black .380
That he always kept tucked and filled with the slugs
Now watch how money bugs
Weight fell it's hard to tell but believe me George has slid
Coming out the closet was the dress that he hid
From the boys when we was over there I seen it out the corner of my eye
I said damn Georgie George signify
The whole crew seen it now the whole block knows
That George gets his kicks from wearing Wisdom's clothes

[Q-Tip]
Now Georgie Porgie pudding pie
What made you choose the path of the gays, oh why
Ain't got no reason, to hell with alibis
Won't play basketball cause your nails ain't dry
Call me homophobic but I know it and you know it
You're filthy and funny to the utmost exponent
Never will I do that, disrespect my mommy
So run and hide your salami
Used to, didn't you, used to be my man
Instead of shaking, you're dragging your hand
Yes it's the Abstract the info provider
Here's your new name - the rump rider

[Hook x3]
