It ain't a problem that I can't fix
Got DVD and navigation up in the whip
So if a bird give me trouble
Put her ass out on the double
Give her bus fare and call it a day
I don't play
With these chicks who have conscience
That's why my two-way got caller ID to block the chickheads knockin'
So let's get it on, let's get it on
What chu' sippin' on, something strong, something strong
Grand Puba to the t-o-p
Honey throwin' them curves like El Duque
Came up from the food stamps to big shopping sprees
I'm only speakin' French to chickenheads, oui oui
Cause I was caught up in all this physical attraction
Now I'm strictly Benjamin and Jackson
It's all day, everyday we don't play
Watch me and shorty blend like we Hen and Alize'

All day (Uh) all day (Every night)
All day (We keep it tight) all day (Yeah, yeah)

[Hook]

Grand Puba got it, just like Sam Goody
So let's go ahead and get this started
Shorty gotta be a half a dub if I parted
Equal to my whip because I only ride exotic
If she not, watch me indo her when I do cotic
WHOA! you OK
Just get up cause we keep it movin' all day
So what chu' waitin' on it's time to get it crunky crunk
If the chicken off the wall and crackin'like they Humpty Hump
I'ma put it on ya just thought I'd warn ya
East Coast, Dirty, Midwest to California
I start, explore a hot broad like Ford
Slap a H on my chest and then I handle it accord
Didley, I be the nigga with the free
If you can't use my mama comb I can't bring you home
So hear me when I say
We lay it down like big breads on top of Parkay
Keep it fat like the FUBU clothes, hey hey hey

All day (Yeah) all day (It's every night)
All day (We do it right) all day (Yeah, yeah)
