[Intro]
Yeah, uhh
I'd like to say peace to all the Gods and Earths
And people of the universe (peace Allah)
Just wanna let you know the black man's first (original Man)
We gonna drop a little somethin like this knahmsayin
On how we feel on the real, check it yo, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Who tells you when to work? (The Devil)
Who tells you when you get a day off? (The Devil)
Well who gives you your pay? (The damn Devil)
And who takes it away? (The Devil)
You mean to tell me that we're still not a slave
In the land of free and the home of the brave? (mmmm)
Knowledge Cipher, divided by Power, equals Wisdom
But you know we have to start with Knowledge first
Divine evil's what dispearse in a hearse
Situation that we in, some people sayin that we're cursed
The lack of the knowledge of ourselves makes it worse
Science that we drop, make the average head burst
So do the knowledge on the very next verse
I heard a brother say, "I wash the clothes, I cook your food
I'll pay your rent," now is that how the story went?
Emphatically no, singer singin' that weak wisdom knowledge
Shit Haji God is here to cancel it

[Interlude]
So just ring the alarm, another Devil's dying, boooohhh
Just ring the alarm, an Uncle Tom is tryin, boooohhh

[Verse 2]
I didn't come to conceal it, I come to reveal it
The True and Living God with the son of man (son of man)
And if you ever need assistance just take my hand
Black man be prepared cause here comes the Klan
Now my great-great-grand
Was hung on a tree by the colored man
You probably know him as a white man
I seen a Oprah Winfrey show, she said that was in the past
But [bitch], kiss my [ass]
Now it's time to teach the people, why our people's not
Treated equal, here's the next sequel (speak on it God)
I stand taller than the tallest wall, you ever saw
Sincere gave the God a call, we boost it from the mall
Long as it's a Devil I'ma take it
If a Devil catch me right, I leave him butt-naked (yessir yessir)
Word is bond, test the God, I don't fake it

[Hook]
Yeah yeah, uhh
Now here it go (here we come)
The soul controller (soul controller)
The soul controller (soul controller)
The soul controller, yeah

[Verse 3]
Now wake up, wake up, cause you went back to sleep
Grab a hold of your mental cause this next verse is deep
Now check out the thing and what they did to Rodney King
That goes to show ya, who controls ya
The Devil man when brothers went looting in Cali
They used the corder-cam, the same as the police man
But I bet my last bottom dollar G
The brothers that they picked up won't go free
See I'm a, disbeliever when it comes to jungle fever
Aiyyo God you trust the Devil? (Now Cipher) Me neither
Now brothers say, "Why you diss the church like Ock?"
Cause if church was good for us, it wouldn't be on every block
Of our neighborhood, just like a liquor store, it just ain't
No good -- they represent the ten percent
Now Momma Lova has no loot, but she'll spend her last dime
To make sure her child has an Easter suit
What is this with Christmas, I just can't see
Spendin your money, givin the credit
To a fat man comin down your chimney (c'mon)
I just can't see it, it's like TV tellin lies to your vision
Haji God is here to make the incision
The soul controller, uhh

[Outro]
Yeah the soul controller, word is bond, the soul controller
The soul controller
Check it
As we come with the twelve jewels we know and understand
The Knowledge Wisdom Understanding
It's Freedom Justice Equality
Food Clothing Shelter
And Love Peace and Happiness
So as we say A-B-C
