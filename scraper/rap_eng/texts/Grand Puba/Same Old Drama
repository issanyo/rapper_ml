[Verse One] [Grand Puba]:
Been there, seen it all, life long drama
Still up in court with three baby mamas
Popo set free after the 50 shot ?
And still some white people won't vote for Obama
The game done changed, a lot of dudes won't last
A buck and some change, fill the truck up with gas
No GPS, don't fuck with EZ Pass
The next thing will be a microchip in ya ass
Feelin' like Marvin
Make me wanna holla
Overseas the Euro worth more than the dollar
9th grade ed, but I drop it like a scholar
Leave my heiro book for the young ones to follow
What does it take for you to really be free?
Know where you're goin' and know your history
Ak and them ain't never done nothin' to me
Terrorism is when you hang a nigga from a tree

[Large Professor]:
Yo, when them trees hit them buildings
That shit was the realness
It's not just petty street crime shit that be killin' us
On the day to day daily
I write Roots like Al Haley
That grow into the trees for the air we breathe
Automatic, each year we grieve
Another soul lost from slavery and the holocaust
Went to work, told the boss
Fuck that I take no shorts
Or no Source
Now me and my cohorts is out concentratin' on a scam
It is what it is and I am what I am
The god put me on to that
I hit him with the B flat
Roll out the red carpet and the door mat
