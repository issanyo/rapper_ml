What's the flavor on these skins you was talkin about the other day?
Oh them ? G, yo I ahh told you

Nah, you didn't tell me

But she tried to flam a little bit on on, ? though
Well then I stepped to her

*singing*
Baby what's your name?  Baby what's your name?
Does she feel ashamed?

If it's alright with you
You see, I can make you feel like
