[Intro: Grand Puba & Shaggy]
What, situation here dis is Shaggy, Grand Puba style
In a dancehall style wicked, whya so versatile chu

[Chorus: Grand Puba & Shaggy]
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
I don't know why she treat like that
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
If it's scheming it's scheming like a demon
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
Why that girl treat me so bad girl?
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
Hey Shaggy we ain't having it, let'em know what time it is

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
Apple in my eye an the key to my yacht
She's the only girl I desire from the start
And if we get together never part
But every time I talk to her she try to blow me off
She keeps trying to avoid
Me to tell the truth girl this really annoys me
But I'm the number one champion
Tha doberman ere on the microphone stand
She says "goddam"
But since I'm such a good man
And all the leading ladies would love to have my hand
So why u treat me like a mad man
Young girl why don't u get with the program

[Chorus: Grand Puba & Shaggy]
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
I don't understand this woman at all
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
You need to knock it off coz we ain't going for it
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
You wait 'til that day, that glorious day
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
Yo Puba

[Verse 2: Gran Puba]
Now baby listen I ain't into butt kissing
If you think I'm going out like that, keep wishing
You play hard to get then u won't get got
If you keep acting up ya end up a have not
Every day it seems that you want to treat me bad
Every day it seems your maxi on a pad
I treat u like a queen and u play me like peasant
No matter what I do u try to make me feel unpleasant
But hey it'll come back to haunt chaya
Never flip the script and say now i don't want cha
I can change like sneakers and clothes
Is git it
Stick it
It ain't change
But a plane ticket

[Chorus: Grand Puba & Shaggy]
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
A wagwan
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
Easy come, easy go
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
I don't know why I have to see ya like this
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
Say ya better take it personal

[Verse 3: Shaggy]
Lover boy says yes may god bless uhhmmmmmm
She uller to told me oh goodness
And that's when she put me to the test
And that's when I had to but the egg in the bird nest
And that's how we rumble
Last night upon real love she stumble
I'm just the same guy that she dissed
And now she never passes me with out blowing a kiss
Yo girl your dismissed

[Chorus: Grand Puba & Shaggy]
Hahaha just like that then
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
Yeah yeah, plain legged sexy keep on walking
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
Now ah wonder who get da short end of the stick
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
That's right are you with me
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
And that's how it goes, check it

[Bridge: Grand Puba]
Ain't no honey fly enough
Ain't no boody fat enough
Ain't no coody good enough
To string out gran puuu
So baby be true stop all the things u do
Before I change my mind and find somebody new
And now you know this is how Gran Puba and Shaggy do
Mother made you
Mother had you
Mother fuck you
As we put it on like that
Time to represent
Here we go
Situation is we ain't having it these days
So we got a let them know
One time

[Chorus: Grand Puba & Shaggy]
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
Now what's the situation again hey

Get a lift
(Why must she treats you so bad?)
Yeah, Grand Puba, Shaggy here girls
