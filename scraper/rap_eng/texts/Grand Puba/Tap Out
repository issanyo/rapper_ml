[Intro]
Okay, New York City
It’s been a long time but the wait is over
Let’s go, you know

[Hook]
Here’s what I recommend you run go tell your friends (better tell her)
To tell a friend to tell friend (better tell her)
That Grandpa Rock back at it again
Here’s what I recommend (for Twitter)
Instagram go tell your friends (Facebook)
To tell a friend to tell friend (tell her)
That Grandpa Rock back at it again (yeah)

[Verse 1]
So what’s good ya’ll
I’m be the spook sat by the door
I’m blackballed when I speak for the cause
When I talk nothing it get me awards
When I touch the stage mamis throw up the drugs
I know it’s been a little minute since you heard me
No matter what you tryna do you can’t curb me
Cause I’m still that nigga since the days of Hilfiger
With the low all day, low life
That’s why my swag to this day still stay relevant
Step in the room niggas like here come the elephant
Now all the girls start coming, Uncle Tom starts running
Devils be like, U-Turn, peace to the gods
This is melanin music so start clapping
And if you liking the melanin start acting
We bout to turn up, get it lit
First niggas in the hood to go bootleg platinum

[Hook]
Here’s what I recommend you run go tell your friends
To tell a friend to tell friend
That Grandpa Rock back at it again
Here’s what I recommend you run go tell your friends
To tell a friend to tell friend
That Grandpa Rock back at it again

[Verse 2]
Now have you ever in your life met a cat like me
I spit these bars till the black man’s free
Same time flashback get loused with the L.I.T
Now I’m P with some N.I.C
We’re the hills with the hilly, I might VIP
I’m at the bar with the Z.O.D
Now Stanford got her eyes on me
Came with the math now now she OD
You run the show with the C.O.D
The Grand Puba what the game could use
I’m a winner don’t know how to lose
I stay crisp, fresh line of kicks
Ain’t nothing but the flick of the biscuit splash brother
Let it go, wait for the swish
Now shawty wanna blow up my six
Send me flicks wanna show me her tits
Bout she gay I don’t care bro
We grown men over here
And if you feeling this one, put it in the air

[Hook]
Here’s what I recommend you run go tell your friends
To tell a friend to tell friend
That Grandpa Rock back at it again
