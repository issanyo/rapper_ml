We are Black (yeah)
Stolen from mommy
Can't make it back
That's why we must learn our roots and culture
The more things change, the more they stay the same (4x)


[Grand Puba]
I made a joint called "Wake Up", I'm Black and I'm proud
Love vs. Hate, plus Times Runnin' Out
I hit you with the God like flow
Knowledge is to know so go get it and grow
You wanna know what's goin' on now, play some of my joints from 20 years ago
Cause ain't a damn thing changed, Black people still dying in vain
Shoot first, don't even ask questions
Stun gunnin', no rights, just arrestin'
Fear of a Black man, that was stolen from the Motherland
And I'm tired of them slave movies
Fifty years done past, still feelin' like the seventies

[Hook]

[Grand Puba]
Now hold up, wait a minute
Where my soldiers at like No Limit
This joint here ain't made for the timid
Same old shit since Ancient Kemet
I came in the door, no tricks, no gimmicks
Black Man God, everybody wanna mimic
Steal my culture, take the wealth
And then you wanna front like you did it for yourself?
But uh, that shit gon' end today
When it comes to this, nigga I don't play
I'ma keep dropping bombs till I'm old and grey
So uh, move nigga, better get out the way
The new Django comin' at an angle
This shit be the new Black Star Spangled
Grand Puba, you know how I put it down
Like a cypher goin' round and round
Circle

[Grand Puba]
Radio, bet you they won't play this
Brand Nubian, keep 'em on the blacklist
(We gotta protect these babies!)
(How many more unnecessary sacrifices?)
(How many more marches?)
(Aren't your feet tired?)
(What happened to our 40 Acres and a Mule?)
(Shit, I wanna build a casino too!)
And me too!
(We need group economics!)
(We need organization!)
(We need unification!)
(The youth must respect the OGs)
(And the OGs must teach the seeds!)
(And mama please burn that weave!)
Shorty you wildin'!
I ain't say that!
I ain't gon' get no shows fuckin' wit'  you!
