Hook:
Word up hip hoppers as you feel the breeze
From New York straight talk to the Tokyo scene   (x4)

Sadat X:
Walkin' New York with the big stick loaded
Most voted for the daily tabloid from Tokyo to Repungy Square
I be there and as the plan unfrail I freak the ?
Sadat X I'm more New York then the yellow cabs
I'll move your pectorial muscle on down to your abs
My man Honda not the car but the DJ
Attacks the pans and move fast with your hands
Up in the wild lands and walked across the burning sands
Can I have a little more Saki in my cup?
Yo DJ Honda I'm kinda fonda these Japanesse women
They treat me like a king and scream my name out loud
There's room for one more three is never a crowd
My Cloak and Dagger is enough to make you swagger
Been on this here stage since 12 years of age
Ha the pleasure prince of poem is invincible
Sight unseen I'm long and lean
It's like that Sadat is president
Ha live and on stage New York resident
Check it

Hook (x4)

Wakeem:
Uh oh camras in flick reports all on my shit
Chickens be analyzin' from London to Japan
Showin' me and my man we chinky off the scomma
They know we holdin' for drama so they ain't sayin' nathin'
Meditatin' mad gucci eatin' sushi
With the chinks who sport links and Georgio Armanni
See me in my China mommy slippin' outta town
She love a nigga long time still holdin' me down
And tell 'em I'm the King Of New York a black Frank White aiight
I'm still polititic scrappin' all the paper in
Bringin' the socki in the Bronx got a brother thinkin'
Live Tokeyo watch Sadat will blow the spot up

Hook (x4)

Grand Puba:
It's time to run right through ya like White Castle do ya
Be true to the game or I'll play like I never knew ya
Brothers here can't get a red penny
Mess around and catch a bad one like that devil Denny
Now a days I'm real leary on the Hilfigure
Hit them people off it's time to see a nigga
A phat Benz seven figures and all that
Cause I'm the one who put Tommy Hilfigure on the map
It's time to surrender servin' MC's like a bartender
Monkey wrench your whole agenda
Brother got more game then Bob Barker
But I'm smoother than Peter Parker
In junior high I kept Vodka in my locker
Mama left don't get home till 6:30
Bag a joint persue to groove and get dirty
I'm puttin' MC's to the curb
Puttin' brothers outta buisness like Barny did Big Bird
I got to have it bad I'm hungry mess around I'll swallow ya
I'm hungrier then a nigga in Somalia
Grand Puba Sadat X comin' here to wet it
Not gonna let it, no
My rhymes vary cause I'm good like Carey
Pop shit like a cherry make you blue like berry
I stay thinkin' me take shorts is dead and stinkin'
I spilt Malibu on my knickers down to my last drink and
Oh let me out so I can run my route
Plus make the girls pout cause I am trippin' out
Baby, no maybe baby on top like gravy
Roll with more motherfuckers than the Navy
No fakin' I puts the Asalam with the Lakim
While brothers turnin' fowl like bacon
You still can't have my stylle cause it's taken
I'll leave you in your boots shakin'
While I'm countin' all the money that I'm makin'
No diggedy no doubt
With my man Honda and I'm out
