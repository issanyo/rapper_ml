[Intro]
Yeah, welcome to God’s neighborhood
Huh
Grand Puba, sparks born king
Let’s go

[Verse 1]
I've been dropping knowledge a long time
I've been giving the bling lifeline
Helping ma people get in their right mind
Using ma powers so they can be refined
Put on Earth to save the babies
That’s lost in the world is crazy
So busy chasing the wealth we disregard our health
With a lack of knowledge of self
See I was told each one teach one
I use my magnetic so that I can reach one
Ma justice cyclon is never done until I
Civilize the sixty second [?]
Until then ima just keep building
Destroying the negativity in the children
Grand Puba brand newbie and band
Asking you what’s the duty of a civilized man

[Hook]
Civilizing civilization through proper education
To build up a stronger nation
We start from the foundation
My wisdom help you understand just exactly who I am
It shouldn’t be that hard feast to the gods

[Verse 2]
Now what you hear is not a test
I take the thoughts from my third eye and I manifest
[?] sent to Earth [?] less
When you add em to your cipher they just be more stress
Keep it right in your eye I deal with actual facts
Stay away from those people who throw knives in your back
See I keep this thing a hunnid whenever I touch the mic
Guaranteed to hit you with something I know you like
It’s the Grand Puba, sparks a born king
Pay close attention to the knowledge that we bring
When it come to this the gods will never quiver
From now until eternity knowledge is infinite
So you ain’t gotta worry ima always stay fly
You never stop learning up until the day you die
And even after death the God will still be relevant
It’s hard to find a brother with this much intelligence

[Hook]
Civilizing civilization through proper education
To build up a stronger nation
We start from the foundation
My wisdom help you understand just exactly who I am
It shouldn’t be that hard feast to the gods
