[MJB] But they just can't do it
[GPM] But you know how that go
[MJB] Ain't nothin to it
[GPM] But, to do it, run right through it
Those who know the time, huh, already knew it
I drink a Snapple and I wet my Adam's apple
And head straight for the center, the dope style inventor
Quick to make a buck, cause it's not beginner's luck
Type of shit that hits, when you pump it in your truck
Not Ashford and Simpson, Ike and Tina Turner
Sonny or Cher, it's somethin dope on your ear
So whether Monday
[MJB] Tuesday
[GPM] Wednesday
[MJB] Thursday
[GPM] Friday
[MJB] Saturday
[GPM] It don't make a matter
This is the type of shit to make the pockets fatter
It's simply splendid, the way that we bend it
But it's time for me to jet, so I'ma let Mary end it

[Mary J. Blige]
You know, you know I know
Puba knows, how to flow (got it goin on)
You know, you know I know-owowwwwwwww (you got it goin on)
