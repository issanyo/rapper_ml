[Intro]
Ay yo, I'm ready to go do this
(Yeah man, it's about that time
It's time to hit the stage) (It's time to make that money, man)
Ay yo money, remember that step (Yeah, I got it)
(Yo, my man, be ready, introduce us)
Ladies and gentlemen, once again, back by popular demand
It's the Masters Of Ceremony

[Verse 1]
Well, to the hip hop and don't stop
To the, beat freak and don't seek
You got the rhythm of the beat that's most unique
Masters of the ceremony won't seek
(Booodily bum bwang, bum buh diddly bung dang
Diddly dung wang) (track)
(Booodily bum bwang, bum buh diddly bung dang
Diddly dung wang) (track)
Maxwell (You know that the beat don't stop)
And Don Baron (And you know that the beat won't stop)
Doctor Who (You know the beat don't stop)
DJ Shabazz (You know the beat won't stop)

[Verse 2]
So make a move, make a move, everybody posse, make a move
So make a move, make a move, everybody posse, make a move
The master move, the master move, do the master move
The master move, the master move, do the master move (Do what ya)
Don hung out to look like a flamingo
Then you roll up a real stack, a real bambo
But some of the eye but, I must they loan
Now wait out of y'all, that's why them love-a the limbo
Them they feed the bat man, they get well low
Say undone your bullets when somebody, it go
Now some them papas, but I limber slow
And when me done, limber them up a bowl up of, you know
A diddly diddly (The beat don't stop)
Diddly diddly diddly diddly (The beat don't stop)
Linga long ligna long linga long linga long (The beat don't stop)
Baling baling baling baling baling baling (The beat don't stop)

[Verse 3]
D-O-C, T-O-R, W-H-O
There's another way to spell it, but I'm lettin' you know
Doctor Who, Shabazz, Don and the Grand Puba
Kick something stupid, wicked wild and youth
You can chill where I live, where I choose to rest
Just to max and relax, I get to guess the best
On the top of the pile, came to rock a while
Masters of the ceremony with a brand new style
We perpetrate, no fake the funk, no phoney (Ay, who we who we money?)
We rap the masters of the ceremony
We came because we heard that you were lonely
We rock for Strong City and Island only (Uh!)
(Shabazz)

[Verse 4]
Well this beat is dope flowing, through the vein
After that, it's hard to maintain your sanity
I got a girl like vanity, who went to school at the hip hop anarchy
(Smash) I play the guitar like Johnny Cash
You bring the cash, I'll bring the pass (Puba)
Maxwell on the strip, I sip the Marshall, you know I go to limp
Eat my, men and lady, blind people crazy
It's just a matter, who takin' pics for 80
Just in swede, Bally shoes
We play the black and we're OK, we can choose
We come to do this for three tense dotted one
Listen of our mission, you can't wait to talk about us, huh
You start gabbin', throw away your crabbin'
But when we throw our pictures, your the first one grabbin' one
'Cause you be on it, front to be not
I got the girlies singin' me, forget me not
Grand Puba Maxwell, the rugged ravin' writer
If I say it's alright, you say it's alright-a
Now let's hear it for my DJ Almighty Shabazz
(Well everybody, one more time)

[Verse 5]
So make a move, make a move, everybody posse, make a move
So make a move, make a move, everybody posse, make a move
The master move, the master move, do the master move
The master move, the master move, do the master move (Come on, Don)
Hang out your arm like an antler (Ok)
Rule the wheels like a rule of cool stunt
So once sweeter than a sucker roomer, and everytime
We chat, we say the crowd enter
No juice knows him Baron, now the big timer
MC that be nice, man, all over (So)

[Verse 6]
Rap start sleepin', and time for start peeepin'
The masters of the ceremony, 'cause we're freakin'
Out on stage, just to entertain
On the hip hop chart, that's where we'll always remain
In the drivers seat, back to rock to the beat
Now as you're feelin' the heat, just means it's complete
Masters of disaster, just can't be beat
Make the move to another fly funky treat
'Cause you know (Diddly diddly) the beat don't stop
(Slong dong diddly diddly diddly) The beat don't stop
(Baling balong baling balong) The beat don't stop
(Baling Baling Baling Baling) The beat don't stop
