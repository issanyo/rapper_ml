[Intro]
Sooner or later yeah
Don’t you know they’re gonna find out in haters
I will stand you can be mine mine

[Verse 1]
So beautiful and intelligent
You make a negative relevant
You so bad baby [?] so you can make a nigga
Like tasty morgan give up with settlement
So what planet did you come from?
I can see now you ain’t blind,deaf and dumb
So check the bill for a minute if you feel
When the billing ain’t no same sky’s the limit
Me and you coz I'm thinking how you do
Plus you keeping as you grow
I can see how you glow
Now I'm trying to get you with  no pimp talk
That’s what I do since I'm young enough from New York
Got a nigga bout the round around the spaces
Say it’s home plate guinness straight
I've eliminate the hate and it’s kinda motivate

[Hook]
Sooner or later don’t you know
That they will find out and hate her
Oh I wish that you can be mine yeah

[Verse 2]
Now have you ever heard
That singing heavy much be missing
And me without you
God missing the goddess
And if we meet together
That’s the lead my strength my hardest
It’s gonna take some money
More than no one just apart us
See reality is that you got the best to me
And I must try the best to be the best like I can be
So let me know baby girl if you really
I ain’t crazy when I think I'm ready to be committed
Let me know baby let me know
That we can grow like a afro
I gotta find woman suitable
Coz ain’t no woman  on this planet more beautiful
So that’s my gal ima full like cow
We gone viewing knockout  and keep the string moving
I said a lot of words but I meant to show it and prove it
If you’re with it and you with it
Don’t waste time let’s get it coz

[Hook]
Sooner or later don’t you know
That they will find out and hate her
Oh I wish that you can be mine
