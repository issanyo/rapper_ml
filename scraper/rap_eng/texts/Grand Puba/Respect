[Pre-Hook]
Ahhh oohh
They don’t care about you
You don’t care about you
It’s the same thing every time
Walk around on that blind

[Hook]
Ooh they don’t respect you
Coz you don’t respect you
It’s the same thing every time
Walk around on that blind

[Verse 1]
Well let’s deal with the fact
Is it what’s black
Came in in fact Land in a blast
The bird placing my van civilization
They’re here to the fact that it was a black nation
We trap the world have a mighty me

[Verse 2]
Have the master build have the plant to seas
Have to travel abroad universities have the bottle of fragrance
Way before the Greece
See who thought of the Greek they gave us man respect
The real father medicines neighbors in hotel
My apology first with astrology, first with geometry
But they don’t want you to see
How beautiful you really are
And take away your knowledge of self
And leave you so blind so blind

[Pre-Hook]
They don’t care about you
You don’t care about you
It’s the same thing every time
(coz you don’t care about you)
Walk around on that blind

[Hook]
Ooh they don’t respect you
Coz you don’t respect you
It’s the same thing every time
Walk around on that blind


[Verse 3 ]
Well let’s stop to think why you think
You shut your lips and nose of the space
They knew for a fact the face was black
Could live with the fact that I live with the black
They try their race destroy their face
They read with the evidence like remember to place (no no no)
Document your lies when there’s [?] of the tray
We built the pyramids where neighbors live in again
Eat the world flesh this is the truth I spit
This is the history but they don’t tell you with
They talk about accident became the confidence
I see it again and again go ask the alien

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah yeah yeah
Can you spare you
Coz  they don’t care about you
You don’t care about you
Tho It’s the same thing every time
Walk around on that blind

[Hook]
Ooh they don’t respect you
Coz you don’t respect you
It’s the same thing every time
Walk around on that blind

They don’t care about you
(They don’t care about you)
You don’t care about you
Tho It’s the same thing every time
Walk around on that blind
No no no
They don’t respect you
Coz you don’t respect you
It’s the same thing every time
Walk around on that blind
