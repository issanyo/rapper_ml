[Intro]
Bless up bless up
Number one DJ Grand Puba

[Pre-Hook]
Now you have never in your lifetime
Heard a flow that is like mine
Non microwaveable its genuine
Still have more than the right time

[Hook]
Grand puba
Genuine and authentic this and baby
We can highly recommend it
And we are so we live we recognize
They were real as represented
No they can't keep the Grand Pu down
No they can't keep the real shit down
No they can't keep the Grand Pu down
No they can't keep the real shit down

[Verse 1]
This flow is non microwavable
Always keep it flavourful
Lord with the lord born with the mic chord
Grand Puba when you say it means royalty
Only run with those who know the true meaning of loyalty
Born with the gift to help my people and uplift
We got to it back like the Bob Marley spliff
I got chemtrails above me pesticides below me
But you can’t stop my flow G cause nigga I ain't Toby
Master of my craft they hath made that to the map
First to select it when they come to the NC drop
Always getting my sister’s soul
Same lies  but diamond in remembrance of the good
Must be shine

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah you have never in your lifetime
Girl a flow that is like mine
The microwave will lead us genuine
Still have more than the right time

[Hook]
Grand puba
Genuine and authentic this and baby
We highly recommend it
And we are so we live we recognize
They were real as represented
No they can't keep the Grand Pu down
No they can't keep the real shit down
No they can't keep the Grand Pu down
No they can't keep the real shit down

[Verse 2]
Now how could this so much so of every long time ago
But girl but I know my soul’s worth more than the ghost (yes)
My ancestor’s blessed me so I never get old
But I hit the gravels worth above of me of milion pounds and gold
Never in your life you find a style like mine
Stop but tumbling this jack like I'm a stop sign
Mommy sit the floor I make you winey wine
Speed up the mule because them love me long time
She ain’t no party like a grand Puba party
Got that party pack with a bunch of  female bodies
That’s not a homies like
We ain’t no no fight we know something rising
The front is really nice
My hook they like coz they can’t get that real sit down
That’s what I do  grand puba in your town
I put it down all the way down to zigzag z
Coz grand Puba did know that

[Outro]
No they can't keep the Grand Pu down
No they can't keep the real shit down
No they can't keep the Grand Pu down
No they can't keep the real shit down
