(Well my beloved black brothers and sisters
It is time for the family to unite
I've said that we can have no family
Unless we love each other
It is no crime for the black man to love himself
And to love his brother as he loves himself
To every one of you that are under the sound of our voice)

[Hook]
It's only one way in, two ways out
One way in, two ways out

I need this money, god damn I need this money
I wanna buy the cars and the jewels and bag the honeys
So little shorty hits the corner of his block
To get his ghetto props, and hit up all the heads with the black tops
Smokers line up to buy the sickness
The green paper stacked on the quickness with the thickness
Now shorty's buying cars and jewels cause he swelling
Tricking on hoes, hoteling from the drug selling
Shorty's only sixteen, asshole full of green
Totes around a semi-automatic gun machine
First of the month is his best nut
Yo you crack monsters know the routine, line the fuck up
Yo I got the jumbo
(Yo yo, I get one on credit, man?)
No shorts dumb ho might as well forget it
(But I'm starving, slick)
That's not my problem, bitch
(A-yo yo, how many cracks can I get if I suck your duck - uh! uh!)
Get the fuck out of here, business continues on
No longer works the corner cause he put some workers on
Living the life of love for love excitement
Til 5-0 hit that ass with his first sealed indictment
That's how they do, they want you to think that you're fooling them
But you're only fooling you
Now he's locked down and his life is on hold
All because of the first five jumbs that he sold
Was the 5-0, you know how that shit go

[Hook]

(Put that gun down
For your black self
The white man will give you a gun
But he knows you're not going to shoot him
Everyday we are sending each other to the hospital
Go to the Harlem hospital and see
How many of us we send in there on the weekend)

Word is bond, I hear you Minister Farrakhan
This is the situation that we're building on
Tears of sadness drowns the black nation
Cause black-on-black murder is the nineties situation
Gunshots ringing in the heat of the night
Mothers sitting home worrying if their seeds alright
Wondering if their son or daughter's gonna be the next one
Who's shot down by the devil's gun
Brothers can't you see the reason they promote that black-on-black
Cause they the enemy, using tricknology
Killing each other over jealousy or just to get a name quick
Yo now that's that bullshit
But when you show love for your people
Niggas look at you like you're smoking crack
They favorite line is "Yo, fuck that it's 'bout the money, black"
But we can get all that
If we stop sticking the knives in each other's back
Cause if we don't back we're sending each of us back
And you know you can't spend loot under dirt, black
That's why I help as many brothers as you can you see
Cause what comes around goes back around, are you with me
(Put that gun down)
Give a brother a pound and unite so lost and found can travel like sound
You see my duty is to civilize those who been victimized
Looked into the devil's eyes and don't realize
I come to free the dumb, cause if we're not free then we're dumb
So here the God come, pa rum pum pum pum

(We are killing ourselves
Why are we doing this?
Because the family has no love for one another
Black family, let's get it together
Black family, let's love each other
Black family, let's do good by one another
And never let it be said again)
