[Verse 1]
They think I'm on a mission and I'm just what they're wishing
They want me to search like I'm on an expedition
When I leave my position, better yet my post
Is when they're gonna wanna move in, to get close
Beyond shadow of a doubt, you will be the lookout
As your boy goes through the pages, and checks out the clout
Run about, like two mice on a cheesy heist
You did it to yourself and now you're paying the price
You stand there, with a heart full of fear
Then you give your boy the signal, the coast is clear
He ran from the rear in his ninja gear
Saw you, and on cue said "We outta here!"
You never got what you want it, but I took it as a diss
Later on, you'll see you're causing further complication
To this situation, the body sensation
Has to come to a stop, this leak of information
This is an example that has been proven
That's why Shabazz is yellin' and he's tellin' me to (Move on)

[Hook]

A-ziggy-ziggy-zoong-a-zang-ah
A-ziggy-ziggy-zoong-a-zang-ah
A-ziggy-ziggy-zoong-a-zang-ah
A-ziggy-ziggy-zoong-a-zang-ah
A-ziggy-ziggy-zoong-a-zang-ah

[Verse 2]
To start, this is a track from the natural nat
Clamp on it 'cause your amp on is never relack
Hard like a cinder, hotties will surrender it
If you front a small gang, don't quiver it to defend it if
Nothing, nada, can rock harder
To the simple secret sounds, that is modified
To blow your speakers, but your beat seekers
We're always seen to get busy 'cause we're peakers
Hurtin' like a blister, confusing like twister
Tell your mother, your father, your brother
And go tell your sister that, Maxwell and the Masters Of Ceremony
A brand name like Ronzoni and Ricearoni
We didn't make it for you to take it and eat it
We're only hear to advise you, because you need it
Never again, and this shall be proven
When you ever find another group, chat or make you move

[Verse 3]
Now big drum beats pound (As the posses bounce around)
Gown (Don't frown) 'cause you know the three are down
To keep you moving (We're proven) it can be done
(So get wit it) because we're number one
So let the knuckles chuckle (Giggle and laugh)
They'll be the first ones (Beggin' for an autograph)
It doesn't matter (There's no one badder)
(It's been proven) So you know you gotta keep on moving
