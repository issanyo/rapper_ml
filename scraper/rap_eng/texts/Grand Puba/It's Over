[Intro]
Oh my heart is crying out to me

[Verse 1]
Yeah don’t try to play me, you’ll play yourself
You can go, you aren’t ready
We be through this shit too many times before
I got your bags packed, tired of these flashbacks
Better yet I’ll leave your shit right where it says ‘Welcome’ at
It’s no more drama baby you can play Mary J
All you gotta do is leave them keys and be on your way
Now see I’m good with that (I’m good with that)
And if you’re feeling that, let’s keep it a hundred
This relationship ‘pose to scrap
Like JOB pack your shit get outta here
I don’t care, move to some else where
This shit is over (over, over, over)
Got mad time I think about it on that road trip in my Rover (yeah)
I used to love her, protect her some Barbra Streisand baby
Cause that’s just the way it was
I ain’t trying to be funny
But you have a better chance finding that bitch
You better have no money

[Hook]
It’s over
Hit the bricks, kick rocks, get to stepping, one two
Cause me and you is through
Call it a day
And don’t you come back no more, no more
It’s over
Hit the bricks, kick rocks, get to stepping, one two
Cause me and you is through
Call it a day
And don’t you come back no more, no more

[Verse 2]
I thought you heard them bars I spit on that joint, brother and brother
You stupid?
Do I look like I stu, stu, stu, stutter
You graveyard baby, listen me and you finito
You had your chance one on one
Wondering why you missed the first free throw
Now you on the bench and you bout to be traded
It’s a process of elimination, you eliminated
Let me tell you what happens when you try to play the Puba
You gotta get your ass up in the Uber

[Hook]
It’s over
Hit the bricks, kick rocks, get to stepping, one two
Cause me and you is through
Call it a day
And don’t you come back no more, no more
It’s over
Hit the bricks, kick rocks, get to stepping, one two
Cause me and you is through
Call it a day
And don’t you come back no more, no more
