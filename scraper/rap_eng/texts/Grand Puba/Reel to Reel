Here's that shit, yaknahmsayin?
As we bounce it like this
For those who don't like it..

UHH!  Hey, uh, yeah, yeah
YEAH  Yeah, HEY!
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, HEY!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, HEY!
It's just that shit (just that shit)
That same ol' shit (that same ol' shit)
Yeah yeah, it's time to hit the wreck
What you expect, check out how we connect

Well it's the reel to reel (it's the reel)
Well it's the reel to reel (well it's the reel)
It's the reel to reel (it's the reel)
Well it's the reel to reel (it's the reel)

It's time to shake that shit because you know this one's the answer
Hon's cut off, cause I smoke boom, my sign is cancer
Time to clear the pack cause here comes Mr. Jolly RANCHER
Who's gonna flip that shit?  You know the ANSWER
Jump into my briefs, because the boxers my jewels jingle
I got a girl, but you can play me like I'm single
Don't worry hon, my pops showed me where it tingle
It's time to catch on, to this Grand Puba lingo
No fuss, don't worry, Toys Ain't Us
Some call me horny so just call me Mr. Lust
Dope shit we got it so it's time to get retarded
So play like Handiman and LAH GUU GUU GOT IT!
No fakes see we got it what it takes
We stay far away from snakes, sippin on the chitlin shakes
You know the deal, on how we really feel
C'mon hon, this shit is real

Cause it's the reel to reel (it's the reel)
Well it's the reel to reel (it's the reel) Stud Doogie
Aiyyo it's the reel to reel (it's the reel) Alamo
Well it's the reel to reel (it's the reel)

Now back at it is a dope rhyme addict
Niggas try to copy but man your shit has had it
So just let me do my thang, for all my people, hey hey hey!
It doesn't matter the demo, just to keep it simple
Take the A-Train to the show so you can cancel the limo
Stud Doogie, Alamo is on the top top (top top)
And if ain't a zigga zigga then it ain't hip-hop (hip-hop)
I like when girls shake they booty to the rhymes that I send em
Some look good, so pardon if I bend em
Used to live in the Rule, smoke a mic like Kools
Niggas that I used to swing with is smokin wools
Damn they won't drop it, I strive to make them stop it
That shit's depressin so let me change the topic
Honey how's it feel when the real shit hits ya?
