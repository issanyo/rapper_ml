Bring it down...
(Chorus)
As we proceed well dressed to get done
Live well, dress well to the day it's done (2x)

(Grand Puba)
Come here singing, check this 2 piece combo
Grand Puba, Dat X snatching Polly-o
Please, dig the way we grant this cheese
Looks a whole lot better wit a pocket full of cheddar(yea)
We smacked this on the blizzard day we all remember
We stomp through wit Gortex and 3 ?guaded? timbers
So Ali, put them things to a halt
Get that rhythm so we can stack these papers in a ?boat?
No time for chicken when a nigga politicing
No time for sticking cuz honey here is easy picking
I need to be straighter than gator
Catch a flashback and you can do me in the project elevator
It's no guessing when it comes to this session
Ah, it's no diggy, Ali hit us wit a blessing
Me and Sadat go back to the days of the sandbox
Now we much bigger, still love ya nigga
We used to chase honies back then
Now all we chasing is decimals, Range Rovers and Mercedes Benz
850's and houses, no time for skirts and blouses
Bitch, back the fuk up of my trousers

Chorus(2x)

(Sadat X)
Yea yea yea
Can you face success for the coming year
Drink jet, lay back and get your swiderve
Make the breadline wind way around the corner
I want all of my people to be rich so life wouldn't be such a bitch
The same way as it comes, I want my pockets filled wit lumps
Puba, you know me for 20 odd years
Let's raise our glasses in cheers, ?that was all our? careers
You know what, we goaling in since the days of old
My pockets been swoll yet unconsole
Never dwell, we live swell on the d-low
Raise the person now in you, getting wit the us and now
Alamo, if you hit me once mo' wit that
I'll return and burn, kill shit for the ages
Rip up the stages listed in the yellow pages
They better slow down wit that slander
I am the great Sadat X from New York state
And I rate much more than pretenders
I'm down wit mindbenders and the big moneyspenders, the big earners
There'll be no cross burners in this part of the grass
I'll be the first one to flip and run up wild in that ass

Drink it down...
Chorus(2x)

(Sadat X)
Let bygones be bygones was last year's episode
This year I wanna explode wit the great paper caper
If the move is willing, should I not go for the killing
Freewheeling poses alot of death, wack rappers waste alot of breaths
The cognac is back in a mid size glass wit ice
I'm already nice, who got the dice
So let's roll, hold on, let me gain control
When you hear this jam, you can bet your last dollar
I was jack deep down born in a whole squalla
Hey Puba, speak to these people

(Grand Puba)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, man, yo
My days is over playing Willie Cassanova
Used to fuk wit these bitches til I smacked up my Rover
Used to take the hoes to the hotel
If they wanted mo', used to take them to the motel
Shit was swell, in '96 though I be mad jell
Cuz if you play these niggas out, they might go tell
And on that note, let's shake it to we all butt naked
Keep the crisp style flowing, 'Mo, keep the beat going
It's Grand Puba, Ali, Sadat and don't foget it
Make you happy like the day that OJ was acquitted

Yea as we put it on like this, know I'm saying
Wild Cowboy, Grand Puba, Ali, ?mow wow skow?
Black, Bird, Mark Da Spark, Stud Doogie, huh, yea
