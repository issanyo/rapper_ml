Yea yea yea aha
You know what it is right now
Grand Puba
Reality puttin' it down the way it's supposed to be
And right now we bangin' with the Phillies nigga
Pay attention

You know how I freak it
If I don't live it, don't speak it
Me killing tracks is no secret
Swag so tight gotta leak it
Like a chick with a bad tittie job listen to the gardens
I put it down like a ugly baby
Flow on top likeygravu
Squash they tighter than the navy
No, I'm not Captain Saveachick
But you cause always hell of it
Please God save me
Make a wisdom spend 1000 and some change
Cover mad terrains when I hop up in the rains
This Hagi, I got a glow like no one
Still telling chicks 68 and I owe one
I go in like the first day up in the pen
Plus, I'm nice with the pen
Pay attention, class is 'bout to begin
I'm a show you how to put it down and come out with the wind

Make no mistake that you're the patient
Far from degradation
A mix of young and old
Bebop, hip-hop N soul

Make no mistake that you're the patient

Oh yes the stakes is high
Even way way high
Now on the radio, the way they flow
It's hard to get inspired now
Frustratin', make me set a fire, burn their house down
Typically a sympathy, I understand this industry
You don't wanna rap like that but pockets can't get empty
You don't wanna make tracks like that but the checks is mighty temptin'
It's what I fade away sittin', real dop shit be missin'
So we be reminiscin', to old shit we gotta listen
Pair of stints, so offensed, might get you a aneurism
We be X Boxin', y'all niggas Activision
Way too primitive, limited or dumb
And the age of the Internet, so nigga where I come
You could Google, get linked in and download apps
I'm sure they got apps to fix it up them whack ass raps
But nevermind, don't pay me no, my I'm just talkin'
This is strictly for them real heads, keep on rockin'

Make no mistake that you're the patient
Far from degradation
A mix of young and old
Bebop, hip-hop N soul
