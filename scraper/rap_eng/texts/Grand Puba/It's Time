It's, it's time
Uh-uh, yeah
It's time
Tamar
It's time
Grand Puba
It's, it's time
2000, what out, what?
It's, it's, it's

It's time that you were my true love
But you cheated
And I found out about it
Now it's too late to hide
But you say you love me
But you do things
You tried to abuse me
And what we had

It's time I let you know (it's time, let you know, yeah)
I won't be wasting my, wasting my, wasting my time with you, boy (oh yeah)
It's time I let it show (let you show)
I won't be in your, in your, in your lie, as it's out the door, yeah (I won't, oh no)
It's time I let you know (time I let you know)
I won't be wasting my, wasting my, wasting my time with you, boy (my time, you, you, you know
It's time I let it show
I won't be in your, in your, in your lie, as it's out the door, yeah (I won't be in your, oh no, I, I, I know)

I gotta find me a new love
Boy, you love her
That won't be no further
Nobody's gonna be there
I wanna be with a lover
Who's down for whatever
And'll make me feel better
Boy, that ain't you

It's time I let you know (no no no no no no, I'll let you go)
I won't be wasting my, wasting my, wasting my time with you, boy (my time, you, yeah, you know it's)
It's time I let it show (time, let it show)
I won't be in your, in your, in your lie, as it's out the door, yeah (oh yeah yeah, your lie, hey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
It's time I let you know (time I let you know)
I won't be wasting my, wasting my, wasting my time with you, boy (my time)
It's time I let it show (time I let it show, babe)
I won't be in your, in your, in your lie, as it's out the door, yeah (you, the door)

Oh, a lot of things are down
Every time I let you back in
And when I think about all the plans that we made
How could you just go and miss out, away?

Come here, let me holla at you, dear
I won't let you down so severe
That your last relationship won't compare
Plus you know I'm feeling you, dear
So once I spit it in your ear
It sends a chain reaction all the way down there
I don't clown when I fool around
Get your head in the house (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And let's see the town
Hella cops, they're riding on the ground
Push the Yankee Stadium in the boogie
Down a picnic on the picture - smile!
'Cause whatever you want
24/7, 365
We're more game than 2000 men live
'Cause some thugs are known as good lovers, yeah
Lot of thugs be needing baby's mommas for love
Uh-huh, so how 'bout us
Trust, watch me bust
And if you feeling this baby
Ain't no more to discuss
Not trying to diss you but if you don't
You got some issues (if I don't let you know, baby)

It's time I let you know (oh oh oh oh oh)
I won't be wasting my, wasting my, wasting my time with you, boy (my time, oh)
It's time I let it show (time I let it show)
I won't be in your, in your, in your lie, as it's out the door, yeah (baby, baby, bae, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
It's time I let you know (time I let you know)
I won't be wasting my, wasting my, wasting my time with you, boy
It's time I let it show (I let, oh I let)
I won't be in your, in your, in your lie, as it's out the door, yeah (you go, I let you go, the door)

It's time I let you know (hey, hey hey yeah, hey, you know)
I won't be wasting my, wasting my, wasting my time with you, boy (my time, oh oh oh)
It's time I let it show (oh oh oh)
I won't be in your, in your, in your lie, as it's out the door, yeah (no boy, no, oh oh oh oh oh)
Should've been and done that shit
