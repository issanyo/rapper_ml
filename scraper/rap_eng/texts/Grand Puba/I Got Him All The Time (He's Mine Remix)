[Slick Rick Sample and MoKenStef over the sample:]
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He

[Intro:]
MoKenStef on this tight remix
Peep at how we flip this
MoKenStef on this tight remix
Yo, peep at how we flip this
MoKenStef on this tight remix
Peep at how we flip this
Flip it, flip it
Peep at how we flip this

[Chorus:]
He's mine
You have him once
But I got him all the time
He's mine
You have him once
But I got him all the time


[Verse 1:]
He might be doing you
But he's thinking about me
So lady, think about another lover
And go find another brother
I know he's my man
He's all in my hands
It feels good when he calls my name
Don't you wish you had the same?
Feeling disgust working your stuff
Until he thinks about mine
Now he's feeling real high
You ask why? 'cause he's mine

Tell you something
That just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man
Who don't love you
I wouldn't waste my time
Telling something wrong
You've been with him one night
And now he's coming home

[Chorus]

[Slick Rick Sample and MoKenStef over the sample:]
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He


[Verse 2:]
You went out on a date
You wasn't out too late
He took you to a room
And you gave it up too soon
Played you like a trick
'Cuz you let him hit
Now he's coming home to a lover
That is strong, oh so strong

I got all his love, don't try to take it
You wanted a piece, you were mistaken
So please just stop playing games
'Cuz he belongs to me, can't you see?

[Chorus]

[Slick Rick Sample and MoKenStef over the sample:]
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He
Cool when you 'cause a cozy condition, He


[Rap: Grand Puba]
You want it? You get it
But it's just for a minute
Talk my talk and watch me
Bounce right in it
See ain't no frontin' type clever
Keep it on the low
And you can be my part-time lover
'Cause all I got is part time
I got a baby at home who gets full time
So relax your mind, have a good time
Honey, sing the line
Honey, sing the line

[Chorus] (2x)
