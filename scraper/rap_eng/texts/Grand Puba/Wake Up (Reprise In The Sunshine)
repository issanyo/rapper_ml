[Intro]
Peace to the Gods, Peace Allah
A-yo there go that brother Grand Puba
I heard that brother got knowledge of self
Yo, true indeed brother
Yo, let's have that brother come over and add on to the cipher
A-yo knowledge this

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
The attribute Hagi helper to another God
In need He Allah God Islam
As I proceed to civilize the uncivilized
Word of wisdom to the groove from the wise (speak on it God)
I guess I'm like the Verbalizer for the fact I'm moving blackwards
This Asiatic black man is a dog spelled backwards
The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization, God of the universe
Manifesting thoughts with my infinite styles
Making sure this travels twenty-three million miles
The other six I set the crucifix
Because the heart of the problem is this.. (speak on it God)
Preacher got my Old Earth putting money in the pan
For the rest of the week, now I'm eating out a soup can
He has a home, drives a Caddy through town
Has my Old Earth believing that he's coming from the ground (Jesus)
Slain are those who fought for what was right
Slayed are those who fell victim to the pipe
A drug controlled substance, contained in a vial
Set up by the devil as he looks and he smiles
Good at the game of tricknology
But I have knowledge of myself, you're not fooling me
You see the answer to me is black unity
Unification, to help our bad situation
I wrote this on a day of wisdom power
All being born to myself (God!)
I won't diss the next brother to be paid, that's not my trade
It's just the plan that is designed by the colored man
Now our babies are born to think this is the way of us (The way of us)
That's the way the devil wants it so it is no fuss (It is no fuss)
It's just that sad old song, "Self Destruction"
To stop our reproduction

[Refrain]
They put our Wisdom before us (murderer!)
That makes it Wisdom, Knowledge (murderer!)
But we need Knowledge, Wisdom to bring forth the Understanding (murderer!)
Culture, Freedom (murderer!)
Power, Refinement (murderer!)
Equality, God, Build, Destroy, Borns our Cipher (murderer!)

[Pre-Hook]
(Can a devil fool a Muslim?) No, not nowadays bro
(Do you mean to say the devil fooled us four hundred years ago?)
Why Equal Self, a trader made an interpretation
Saying that we'd receive more gold for our labor in his nation
(Did we receive more gold?) God, Now Cipher
It's time to drop the bomb and make the devil pay the piper
(True indeed, God, true indeed, God) Why Equal Self
(True indeed, God, true indeed, God) Why Equal Self
(True indeed, God, true indeed, God) Why Equal Self
(True indeed God, true indeed) Why Equal Self

[Verse 2: Grand Puba]
The solution, knowledge of self to better ourself
Cause I know myself, that we can live much better than this
Nothing's changed, it's just another sequel
The devil's still causing trouble amongst the righteous people
Drugs in our community (That ain't right)
Can't even get a job (That ain't right)
Poisoning our babies (That ain't right)
Lying who is God (That ain't right)
Well here's some food for thought, many fought for the sport
And the black man still comes up short?
It's time to motivate, build and elevate
Blind, deaf, and dumb, we've gotta change their mind state
So I dip dip diver, civilize a 85'er
Gotta let him know the devil's a conniver
This is the plan from the brother man
From the motherland, now it's time to take a stand
I keep striving to do my duty to awake 'em
To the universal family, I say asalaam alaikum

[Outro]
Yeah, now I'mma do like this
Nuff respects to the brother Jazzy Jay, nuff respect
Nuff respects, to my Brand Nubian brothers
Bust it, Lord Jamar, God Allah
Derek X is on the flex
Alamo is good to go
Sincere, the God is in here
So move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
Move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
Now before I motivate I'mma just say like this
Please, educate Allah's children, with equality
Move on black man, move on
You gotta move on black man, move on
