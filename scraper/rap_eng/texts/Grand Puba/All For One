[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
I hit a beat and swing a note as if my name was David Ruffin
Quick to toast an MC just like an English muffin
Don't worry about a thing because the Puba's never bluffing
I gets headaches from the wack, so then I take a Bufferin and I max
I wait until the opportune time and then I tax but should I max?
Now they say sinning is for sinners so I guess I'm not a sinner
Beginning's for beginners so I guess I'm no beginner
This is how I spark it, puts money in my pocket
When it comes to having pleasure I gets hard as a rocket
MC Grand Pu coming through all the residue
The songs remain classics dating back to the Babalu
My boys I call 'em Akh, the foes I let 'em jock
And I can think of many episodes I swung in Lincoln Park
No I'm not a phony and I got a tenderoni
Love the way she is - not too fat, not too bony
Don't drink Sanka, won't sink like a tanker
Knock the boots off a skirt in Casablanca and I thank her
Some rappers stink like Englebert Humperdinck
Better yet Dick Cavett, I got a bad habit
Similar to the girl on She's Gotta Have It
I think with the brain and I whip behind the zipper
I'm living kinda good similar to Jack Tripper
A landlord named Roper did a show at the Copa
When I'm finished with this I'll be paid like Oprah
So if honey wants to act fly
I'll just play like Guy and I'm (saying, "bye, bye, dumb bitch!")
Stick out your thumb and hitch
Cause you've been cut off like a light switch
See I'm programmed to slam, winter, summer, spring or fall
Before I do a show I get some kicks out the mall
Then I get my gear and I give Trev a call
Cause he works in the barbershop, right behind the mall
Other rappers tried to rob me but you know they got did
To put it blunt, honey I shrunk the kids
So bookers back off break North here comes the regulator
Betcha that you find none greater

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
On file is a style, that's why you caught a clip
My suitcases is packed and I'm going on a trip
To Mic-a-delphia I go for self and still be slamming
The school bell is ringing and I caught somebody cramming
For the test, oh yes, my study guide was thick
I cut you with my verbal, didn't hurt you just a nick
Off your face, don't play possum watch me and I'll blossom
Like a rose and get some new clothes
And a fresh fade from Rob
Jamar on the phone and now the Now Rule Mob
The come one, come all, we about to get hectic
If my crew don't get in, then the X makes a exit
To the rear, I'm outta here, don't front on my brothers
I take care of them before I take care of others
The wood bats is doomed, in the 90's it's aluminum
Step to the stage with a mic and I'm doing 'em something awful
I'm a citizen and I'm lawful
I go to Hunter in the fall, rip the policemen's ball
I got the power to make a car stall
I get some drinks from Glackens, and when the crowd slackens
I stop drinking and then I start thinking about
Days in the past when Derek X was last
But now I'm on the top, damn, news travels fast
Cause I'm like that, they can't see this
Read my book, it contains many pieces of verses
I took the time to delete all the curses
So moms reach deep in your purses
And buy me, take me home and try me and do me well

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
Well, while I reign rhymes pour
You suck it up like a straw and jump on the dance floor
Cause every time I step in a jam
I make like a door and slam
But then girls try to turn my knob cause I'm a heart throb
I guess it's just a hazard that comes with the job
Cause every time I rock a rhyme that shows Jamar is intellectual
Girls want to get sexual
Well I guess I have to cope with being so dope
You want to be me, but can't see me with a telescope
You seek and search but still you can't find
You're weak and it hurts to be deaf, dumb and blind
A supreme mind will take you out of your paralysis
I grip the mic so tight I get callouses
And your analysis is that the Lord
Whips rhymes into shape with a mic cord
I do it good cause I'm a positive black man
Eating up suckers as if I was PacMan
Not a Dapper Dan fan, I stay casual
To rock like the J it comes gradual
You got to know the ledge to wise the dumb
And understand your culture of freedom
Power equally with the Gods
So you can build and born your cipher
All your life you must teach truth
Of the true and living God, not a mystery spook
And when you do that, pursue that goal
Which made the student enroll and only then you'll prosper
