[Verse 1]
This is a one crew (Quit pullin' a hoo)
You and you (Know what you got to do)
Salute it, like the star spangled
We're here to tangle, comin' at an angle
Look alive, G-O, we're ready to go
Masters of the ceremony (If you didn't know)
You try to copy that (But you're a baby to this)
Drinkin' Similax, see, we were born to do this
Almighty (Our DJ), his name is Shabazz
First class (Blast)
(Burst of flavor) Just your favorite DJ savior
You'll be shocked by the scratch he gave ya
So bear witness to the fitness, get back
Step to the store, and get this new track
Why's that ('Cause it's simply)
Dynamite

[Verse 2]
Explosive, word to the utmost
You get a feeling similar to the holy ghost
Bet your bottom dollar I can make your girl holler to this
Ain't lucky, it's charms, and it ain't no
Trix are for kids, advertised by a rabbit
Beats done by Pooh when I make the shit
I have it, I develop
Many many moons ago, bangin' on table tops, a new row
Grand Puba Maxwell, truly not booly, and newly
Won't catch my lips on a cooly, I wooly
Nah, I ain't goin' out like that
On a battle of crack, huh, picture that
I let the girls get strung, boy am I hung
Like the mighty Joe Young
The little drummer boy, ba-rump-pa-pum-pum
No need in worrying, 'cause here I come
Doc as the side, kick a nickel on the dance
Can see you also, and as the way it goes
Helter Skelter, suckas want the shelter
I'm so hot, I might melt, or miss the organic
No need to panic, man
Masters Of Ceremony cold runnin' the planet
So get with it, and if you ain't with it, then forget it
But somebody's lit it, so it must be
Dynamite

[Verse 3]
Another motivator, greater than a dominator
Causin' trouble on the double like an instigator
So whip out your beef and cause a flame to flick
Now bring the heat to me, and greet the wick
Light it, yeah, now you're excited
A production sponsored, funded, and provided by the brothers
Not like the others, with another dope beat
That covers and smothers like a blanket
Pump it up, now crank it
Give the power to the people 'cause I want them to rank it
Played on the blocks where you see hard rocks
Kickin' the Nikes, Filas, Addidas, and Clarks
D-Y-N-A-M to the I-T-E, unstable, but the label's still T-N-T
That's packed to the ceiling, with the kick of nitrous
Stand back, throw this, when it's about to blow
Dynamite
