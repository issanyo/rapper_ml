[Intro]
Ha!
Hun, Hun!
Ha!

[Verse 1]
Rugged and raw
Follow it like a law
The same one that you got
Off the rack at the store
More! Vibrating than a bone killing cancer
Rythym attacks just like a black panther
No rippin', no flakin', no breakin'
We took it so you know it's taken
You think about it, dream, scream and shout it
But, never doubt it cuz you can't do without it
Get loose, grab a space
Get a spot on the floor
Gas it up like a Jetta
Rev it up, let it roar
Bring your whole damn gang
And if they can't hang
They will learn and turn
And come back, like a boomerang
Just working hard to make a posse move
To a groove like this
You know we're out to prove
That we got it, get it
The commited touch
Brothers of the Ceremony, are just too much
Got Shabazz on the scratch
With the speed of Mario Andretti
Turn on the turntables
Get the record steady ready

[Bridge]
Ouh!
Come on!
Ha!
Yo check it out!

[Verse 2]
I took a break from the rhyme
Which was the perfect time
The phrase came to my head
Seek and you shall find
I found out the beat was booming, ram-bamming
I took a look at the meters and they were slamming
Get ready for this one, cuz at a show
The bass is taking the place of a body blow
You can call it the coming of the messiah
But whatever you call it, it's on fire!
Dr. Who is the source, SP is the force
Stay by me, dont get lost as I rock on course
Do some slide and dips
Rock the spins and flips
Pucker up those lips
And rotate those hips
Dont quit, don't forget to show them what its about
Take a deep breath, relax, now push it on out
Breakin' out the same way I came in, I came and rocked it
Slam in the door, put in the key and then lock it

[Bridge]
Hun Hun!
Yeah !
Hugh!
Yo check it out!

[Verse 3]
This one will heat you up like it was Swiss Miss
And we came to do this upon a quickness
Straight up and down smooth dip and dap
Break down collapse, hey yo hops its no haps
Maxwell with the manager who's name is Bill
I don't want it but if I want to, then I will
This one will hit the floor like a oil spill
And if you slide, every little thing is chill
Give me a home where the crack-a-lack heads don't roam
Like Patti Labelle kicked it, I'm on my own
(Yo use the other one too)
What if only you knew
Some of the things that a crackhead would do
Word!
Everything is a troop in what you heard
Bringin' a stunt to my crib is totally quite absurd
Crack vials in the aisles, but enough on that tip, Doc
Cuz all I wanna do is just [Rock!]
(Watch Shabazz keep the turntable) [steady!]
Are you ready? Well let me finish
We giving the shivers and quivers and you start breakin'
Receivers of believers on the cheebas are aching
Strong City is the label
Maxwell is quite able to climb up on the stage
And have you swinging like a cable
So this one is for you troop
Brother find a sister if the girls don't get it in pursuit
No need to lag or lolligag
Masters of Ceremony is here to rag
Non stop! I bet you that you wanna rock
Yo its time to push doc
