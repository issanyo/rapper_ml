[Hook]
Let me tell you just who you are
Sky’s the limit when you know yourself
Don’t you know that you’re original
No need to try to be someone else

[Verse 1]
Yeah let’s go we original kings and queens (yeah)
It’s time to get back up in the swing
Just check out the style I bring (yeah)
I drop jewels with the song I sing
I come here for a reason, that’s to wake up in the lightning
I come to drop a jewel but my people become frightened (scared)
I try to tell them it’s impossible to live with vultures
They rob you for your name and your language and your culture
But now we run around and most of us don’t have a clue
But if you only knew the power and the god in you
Wee we can elevate our mind up to another level (level)
Some of us keep showing out because we love the devil (yeah)
You coon ass nigga you can’t fool me
You may be eating but your people ain’t free
You think you’re living good, you’re just a pea in a pod
And that ain’t really nothing when you’re supposed to be god

[Hook]
Let me tell you just who you are
Sky’s the limit when you know yourself (know who you are)
Don’t you know that you’re original (original)
No need to try to be someone else (nope)

[Verse 2]
Yeah cause junction, junction. what’s my function
Dropping hot bars and make my people grow
Never been the type of dude with the bullshit flow
Always keeping shit above so I get that dough
I coulda made mad chicken if I sold my soul
But that shit done never happen so we never know
I know one thing, brother Malcolm always ride with me
GOD always burned inside of me
We’ll be free as soon as we recognize
And stop looking on things through our enemy’s eyes
Cause we original, original, original, original
And not a [?] cadred copy soul

[Hook]
Let me tell you just who you are
Sky’s the limit when you know yourself
Don’t you know that you’re original
No need to try to be someone else (no need)

[Verse 3]
Well I’m just doing my duty (my duty)
So that my people can be free (can be free)
Tell em free they mind
My ancestors called on me (called on me)
They called me to do this job and I’m a get it done, trust
Cause it’s more than slavery (more than slavery)
Certainly cause we’re so original

[Hook]
Let me tell you just who you are
Sky’s the limit when you know yourself
Don’t you know that you’re original (original man)
No need to try to be someone else (no need, no need, no need)
