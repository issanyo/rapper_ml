[Hook]
Nothing is this world ever stop me
Baby boy you know you got me
Overstand I never deal sloppy
You got the keys to unlock me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, no I don’t mess with no religion
But look at all these religion fall nice upon the trend
If she with that shit that mean she wiggle every limb
If it’s bout that paper then well homie count me in
You know I came back just to stack a few stacks
Reappear and disappear like that
(I'm your magic man) yes I am
Grand puba [?] here for health
Get me the top shelf bottle either be the star be the model
Don’t deny it till you try it if you like it you can buy it
Don’t knock it until you rock it knock your thing right out the socket
It’s that PIMP it stands for paper in my pocket
So socialize and get down
See I was bred NYC but mix of some other land
Bring that swagging to the game that’s undeniable
Call me mr reliable making the week MC’s seems undesirable
Cause

[Hook]
Nothing is this world ever stop me (you can’t stop the flow)
Baby boy you know you got me
Overstand I never deal sloppy
You got the keys to unlock me  (I was born to do this)

[?]

[Verse 2]
No I don’t pull no punches so don’t make me pull yo card
Original man with knowledge of myself that makes me god
I always keep my cipher power use outside [?]
Unless that power uses wisdom then it’s all good with me
So let me turn it down a notch cause some a u getting alone
Now let me turn it up I paid the cost the be the boss
You niggas must be crazy if you think my shit ain’t wavy
Then slaving with the eighty cause these devils thing I'm crazy
Jingle two-K-fourteen samething fifteen sixteen
Hit you with that shit and have you leaning like a dopefiend
You can call me foreign if you judge me by my car
Or you can call me god cause my [?] is like aha
Or you can call me juggler cause I like them D-cup large
Or you can call me sun because I'm brighter than the stars
Or straight up Grand Puba or the god that I am
A legendary nigga who will never be forgotten
Cause

[Hook]
Nothing is this world ever stop me
Baby boy you know you got me
Overstand I never deal sloppy (never that)
You got the keys to unlock me

Uh huh
Let's go

[Outro]
Spit a few bars each word is a scotch
Disappear with a ass that’s fat
Oh baby
I'm your magic man (yes I am)
See I run with the god [?] jealousy
That OG will fulfil your need
Oh baby
I'm your magic man (yes I am)
