Papap pap pap
Everyday and night
I always think of you
Know I like your style
And everything you do
If you stand by me
We will never lose
If and I do and I
It’s so showing proof

[Verse 1]
Coz I keep it a hundred
More than what you want but what you need
All this good loving
Baby I will follow
Take the lead
Just trust in me
You always will succeed

[Hook]
Baby, baby everyday and night
Always think of you
Know I like your style
And everything you do
If you stand by me
We will never lose
If and I do and I
It’s so showing proof

[Verse 2]
So hey baby what’s good with you
Diggin' your style and how you do
Never met a girl that’s quite like you
Make you wanna holla by the time I’m through
You got to be one of the baddest chicks around here (yeah)
A-class I could tell by the clothes you wear
And your [?] and your Louis game is so right
And that body-fitting dress you wearing so tight
Hair style natural and you like to have fun
Ain't to [?] ah ah
I just got my hair done
So compensate for the nonsense
She don't sit around and gossip
She blossom

[Verse 3]
So let the rain fall down upon us
So soft and gentle strong in the mental
Till the baby’s coming up
She's so influential
[?] stronger than morphine
Together getting green
We on the same team
Coz if you ain’t part of the team
You ain’t part of the dream
Stand over there 'cause we winners over here

[Hook]
Everyday and night
Always think of you
Know I like your style
And everything you do
If you stand by me
We will never lose
If  and I do and I
It’s so showing proof

[Verse 4]
Coz I keep it a hundred
More than what you want but what you need
All this good loving
Baby I will follow
Take the lead
Just trust in me
You always will succeed

[Hook]
Baby, baby everyday and night
Always think of you
Know I like your style
And everything you do
If you stand by me
We will never lose
If  and I do and I
It’s so showing proof
