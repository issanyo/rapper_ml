[Grand Puba]
I'm a grown ass man, dog
I'm from the days of drinking forties in the heat
But still help grandma cross the street
Where niggas bang on tables making beats
And if your shit was garbage, make your ass take a seat
Dapper Dan fresh from gear to interior
And if you got knocked your homie would take care of ya
Snitchin' at a minimum, flossin' at a premium
Bouncin' through the hood, all the shorties love to see me in
The beamer, the benz, four wheelin' in the range
The players might y change but the game stays the same
Done that, been there, been did all that
Now I school young pups, stack papes, fall back
Let me put you up on game cause what you're doin' has been done before
From the whips to the ice to the whores
So pimp the game, don't let the game pimp you
Cause you know it's Lord 'nesse and Grand Pu'

[Lord Finesse]
I went from the streets and wild scenes
Thugs and foul teams
To make my mama proud and watch her child gleam
It all now seems like just a wild dream
She passed 'fore I had a chance to pile C.R.E.A.M
By all means it's so bugged, hard to show love
I walk around cold and anemic with low blood
But make a quick mill' some say it's hard to earn
Fourth album, people wonder will the Gods return?
You can bet on that, take a loss, you dead on that
You can find us motherfuckers wherever the cheddar's at
We'd be foolish to think  everybody's the coolest
When half these niggas are betrayers like Judas
Major influence, tell us who's style's iller
When we bring the Heat like Deniro and Val Kilmer
With nothing to lose, a lot of shit to gain
So if you don't join the team you might as well quit the game

[Hook]

[Lord Finesse]
Well I'm supplyin' the beat, I'm just tryin' to eat
Walk with me, you just play your side of the street
You lil' motherfuckers, y'all ain't tryin' to beef
Y'all little indians stop eyein' the chief

[Grand Puba]
Cause we don't stop get it get it
Keep it real when we spit it
Tilt that Yankee fitted
No papes, we ain't wit' it
Dudes been payed since niggas been rockin' fades
Mics get slayed like crackhead niggas wit' AIDS

[Lord Finesse]
I'm that divine nigga
I'm that press rewind nigga
I'm that game ain't over until I shine nigga
One of a kind nigga you catch with a bird chillin
A New York vet see I'm somethin' like Herb Williams

[Grand Puba]
You gotta really get it in if you're trying to win
You can stack a couple mill' if you're nice with the pen
See my swag is good enough to bag your mama and your sister
So the next time you see me you better address me as mister
