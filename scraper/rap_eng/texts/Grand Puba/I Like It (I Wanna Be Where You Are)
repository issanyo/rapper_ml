[Intro]
Yeah
"Ladies and gentlemen, I've found him. I want you to meet the baddest motherfucker in town
(Right on, right on, right on)"
Who is it?
Well it's Grand Puba, honey (I like it)
With my man Stud Doogie, love (I like it)
Droppin' 2000 (I like it)
Dig the way this go down(I like it)
Check it

[Verse 1]
I hit a flow all dipped in 'Lo
Sit back and sip Moe as I count my dough
Grand Puba Maxwell, Doogie, comin' with the New York
We keep it real like jail when we mic talk
Honeys know cause when I'm in the set
Grand Puba is the one who makes they stink box wet
So let me tell ya somethin' lady
When ya flow this flow then it's all cream and baby
I made this one for the brothers in the party
To find a hottie and dance body to body
Step one, first you grab honey by the waist
Step two, then you move at a ghetto pace
Step three, then ya look her dead in the face
Step four, now its time to leave this place
Hold up, be careful of the cheesa's
The teasa's, the one who wants the money and the Visa's
I'ma tell honeys straight off the bat
But please don't even go there with that, dig it
This one's designed to make your spine in your back wind
Grand Puba lights it up for you every time

[Hook]
Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya, and ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya say (I like it)

[Verse 2]
Could it be I've stayed away too long
Thief MCs be wishin' I was gone
Because they wanna be where I are
But ya can't get that far, so stop wishing on a star
Its only one Grand P
So honey do what you did on the night you creeped with me
Its no doubt I come real with that the butter track
The one that makes the honeys hit the bed mat
I'm energetic, poetic, athletic, with good credit
So just move like I'm Simon and I said it
Ya see my flow is just a step ahead
I'm still wicked in a bed because I'm down right nasty like newlyweds
So back up and let me breathe
Cause when it comes to gettin' down, I'm gettin' looser than a crackhead's hair weave
And I, betcha by golly wow
Ya never find another style like this if ya search a million miles
So why'n cha let Puba nice your party
I hit a flow like Al Jarreau
See I've been doin' this for years
I'm leavin' MC's in tears, tears; dig it
Cause they fallin' just like the rain
Grand Puba's too much for the brain
Now gold diggers who try to get it
I left 'em backwards, they thought they farted when they shitted
Cause Puba's everything, and everything is Pu
Cause I hit 'em with the (one), and then with the (two)
Yeah, cause that's just how Grand Pu and Stud Doogie do
Ya didn't know I was the bomb, baby?
Somebody should've told you, somebody should have told you

[Hook]
Ooh, yeah I like it
Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City, no doubt (I like it)
Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooh, yeah I like it
Ha ha, and ya say

[Outro]
Cause we get down for ours, we get down, no doubt
Down for ours, we get down, no doubt
Down for ours, we get down, no doubt
Down for ours, we get down
Cause we get down for ours, we get down, no doubt
Down for ours, we get down, no doubt
Down for ours, we get down, no doubt
Ninety-five Flav, and I'm out
Ooh, yeah I like it
Ooh, yeah I like it
