[Intro]
Diddaly-diddaly-diddaly-diddaly-Grand Puba
Diddaly-diddaly-diddaly-diddaly-Dr. Who
Diddaly-diddaly-diddaly-diddaly-Don Baron
We talkin' bout Masters of Ceremony

So hey young girl you can deal with me
Cuz this is not the way you call Turski
Whoever in the konks of the Knicks and Zee
I really want to do what you call sexy
I go higher than the higher mountains
And deeper than the diddaly deepest see
That's all-of-the all-of-the all-of-the all-of-the all-of-the really loved you
So oh darlin' ? your sexy

Grand Puba won't you tell 'em why

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
Hey pretty momma, you look sweet
I mean you're the type of girl that I've been dying to meet
Beautiful than a day in July or May
Now one look or ? you make me say, hah
Good God almighty, look at miss (Ladi-dadi)
Funky figure speech expression she ain't with nobody
Super sexy sassy with the act so together
Lookin' ? super steady and her peers ?
Fly as can be, there's no one flyer
Out to toot up ya beauty is what I desire
A body uncomparable a face so pretty
Don't front, let's get to the nitty-gritty
Remember the day girl when I first met ya
Thinkin' up ideas on how I can catch ya
'Cause girl you look good in that million dollar sweater
I said to myself,  "Yo, I best to go get her"
So I walked over as cool as can be
I put my arm around ya baby and ya girl tried to bite me
For what reason, I don't have a clue
But the way she looks honey, her nickname could be doo-doo
I had my cousin with me, to him she tried to kick it
Her hair was so knotty that Wilson couldn't pick it
Ya know what she said to him you'll never guess
She said "Do it, Frank" with her nasty bag of breaths
So ya got upset because we snapped on your friend
And the fun that we was having, had only began
And then ya said "I'm not going for this evening"
If ya wanna play games with Grand Puba Maxwell
(I'm leaving) Well go ahead and leave
And may your plane hit Tarzan as he swings from his tree
'Cause I really couldn't care if you was ever coming back
Grand Puba Maxwell will be right then exact
Sexy, baby doll you're so sexy
Devastating, pulsating, captivating, perfect ten
I know you love them and treats
Every time that I see you, you're never alone
Some boys said to guess the number, but you wouldn't tell them
Your eyes get so bright, they're an awesome sight
Never seen a girl like you, day or even night
One glance in your direction, that's all it took
Your body has made everybody look
More curves than a "S", yes God did bless
You with a personality to match your finesse
The Egyptian queen that's seen on the Nile
With the brown complexion and the magical smile
In a beauty contest you would win by a mile
With the great wits, class, grace and style
Girl if me and you could possibly get together
Dr. Who will do (Maxwell) this forever and ever
Never let you go, show you a night on the town
When you're feeling down, girl I will be around
To get motivational, inspirational
Need to succeed when you're feeling low
To get you an injection to get up and go
So there's no need to question what you now know
Angel of the skies, please be my savior
I love you girl, you're my favorite flavor
That's what I do for your sexy touch
Don't hesitate, can't wait, I want you that much

[Bridge]
Girl you are sexy, say that's what you are
Say no one in between, say me and you are one
So just sail away with me
Now to another world
And we'll rely on each other, uh-huh

Sexy is the type of girl you seem to be
Crazy, baby doll that's what you're driving me
She is, a type of girl you can't pass by
Tell her, why do you think she is so fly!

[Verse 2]
There's just one thing that kills me the most
Is when girls know you want em but they play high post
But it doesn't bother me, I think it's rather funny
Cuz so far my record is like twenty out of twenty
Now I like the girls in the summertime
When it's hot, dry and sticky but they still look fine
Bustin' out in all fashions a possession prize
Hypnotize everybody, ya got to realize, girl
I got to have ya baby you know I need you
You ? with Grand Puba Maxwell I won't mislead you
I'm not a perpetrator and I, kid you not
But if ya play hard with Puba then you won't get shot
Sexy, baby doll ya so sexy
I had a dream last night that you came my way
In a red nightgown, no negligee
Now you approach me slowly, I was, hypnotized
Pants levitated to a uncontrollable rise
Girl I was excited, better yet delighted
Uncontrollable desire, I just couldn't fight it
I couldn't believe that it happened it's true
I said it's the prime minister Dr. Who
You'll believe when I compare you to the meaning of fly
There's only four letters girl, S-E-X-Y
I never thought about another
In time you will discover
That I'm not a gigolo, a playboy, I'm just a lover

[Bridge]
Sexy is the type of girl you seem to be
Crazy, baby doll that's what you're driving me
She is, a type of girl you can't pass by
Tell her, why do you think she is so fly!
