[Grand Puba]
First things first, here goes the opposite of worst
Slid out my mother's ass, looked at the nurse, and kicked a verse
This ain't my man Heav's joint, so shit, here's a curse
For those who got stuck, well kuff means FUCK!
That's what I like to do after the Puba makes a buck
For those who say I suck well then step up and push your luck
You're aced out, now your assed-out, I still hit joints
Til they pass out, at three o'clock I let my MC class out (UH!)
So keep a clear focus, cause I say hocus pocus
That's all I have to say to make the mob swarm like locusts (YEAH!)
Then I climb the bridge, push Uptown to the Bruckner
To the Harlem River Drive to pick up Ali at the Rutgers
Then we chatta-nagga-noogi, to go pick up Stud Doogie.. "easy back it up"
Ha hah, so all you Grand Puba wannabees
You better pack it up "easy back it up"

"Back it up, huh, easy back it up"
"huh, easy back it up"
BACK IT UP!
"Back it up, huh, easy back it up"
"huh, easy back it up"

[Kid Capri]
Now dig it
Here's the kid, never did a bid
Never hit skid, check out the shit I did
Live in the Bronx, born in Brooklyn
Chilled in Manhattan never got my shit tooken
I'm easy on the flex, you know my shit is right
We're goin on a flight, so hold on tight
Kid Capri is on point with my man Grand Puba
If suckers try to flex they'll get twisted like a tuba
Never cause trouble, that's not my style
Always on the move, stack papes by the pile
I'm crazy on the low, but I go places though
I always do a show so you know I got dough
Girls try to sweet talk, but bullshit walk
For those who try to hawk I stab clit like a fork
I'm very intelligent, so don't try to play me
Try to press the issue and I'll bust that ass baby
I'm thick like a shake, very high yella
Describe Kid Capri, Uptown's big fella
So now you know the flavor, and please do me a favor
Stay your ass out my path, cause I snap you like a gator, later
