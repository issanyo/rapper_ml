Chorus
Yooo, Dont destroy my mind/
While im still alive/
To the big bang theory/

You'll live through when you see me/
A genocide in times of war from/
That takes of course/
Dont destroy my ch-ch-choiceee/

Verse 1
A microwave of space energy/
Better efortlessly not survivin/
Place of mind, planetary systems/
Piling up from visions/
Once once was dust/
Super symatry cemented these/
This a quark epoch/
(Qualified)
Qualified to lie, god rest pac
And Hadron era/
Collected with the various eras/
Photo time periods/
So no whatever/
Paid it, whatever define/
Photogenic, sans camera/
On an ego fix/
Nucleo synthesis/
Newcomers, envision, this is it/
Planetary systems right up in my face/
And piling up from once was...becoz/

Verse 2
Program plently of fan./
Sharpen gallexies, and uh with my left hand./
Im galvinized to the mind, actually
Begining first before once did I see,/
Clusters, and super clouds wait ever wonder/
A fabrication/
A solar system with the placement/
(Collectivly various photos time will tell ya)
Wanna tell ya, dom-dom-minated
They battled ya/
Im recombinatiom/
The camera, its an ego fix, /
Nucleo- synthisis/
New comers a vision, this is it!/
Anti-matter, domination!/
For crowds!/
Sharpening of the gallexy out loud/
Im galvanizing in my mind now!/

Verse 3
Knowlege or not?
Highly Consintrated plasma
Sided right across the nations/
Skyward caught me/
Universal feeling words acosted me/
Trying/
Lost in Me/
My Entire life to see a boss too see/
Shoelace new place/
With the flaws to be/
I witness matters through stain matter now I'm anti/
Maniac/
Across a community/
I can fly/
Commercial galaxies /
You never know we dont stop/
Collected various photo time periods/
Photogenic sans before I'm gi-gi-gi-givin em'
Literally visually, Imma balanced galaxies/
I'm finally what I'm gonna  be/
A Design so fine/
Its faded again across time/
Under cost of the space time continium
