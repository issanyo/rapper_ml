[intro]
Look around, Look around
Look around, Look around
Look around , Look around
Don’t stare at me too long
Look around, Look around
Look around, Look around
Look around , Look around
Don’t stare at me too long

[verse]
It’s been day dreams, of the dream
Won’t you please please
Take my heart away from this life
I feel life in the end stands still
Keep it in the heart the pains real
Tried so hard to keep my ways
Keep my pain away from you

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t take me back (away from you)
What’s wrong with you, Wrong with you (away from you)
Don’t take me back (Trying so hard to keep my pain away from you)
What we gonna do, gonna do
What’s wrong with you, Wrong with you
What’s wrong with you

[verse]
I’ve been drinking, I’ve been smoking pot all day
I’ve been thinking ‘bout the times we used to sit and talk all day
I’ve been popping pills
I’ve been trying sleep but I just chill and think about you still
Tell me that’s not real
Tell me what you feel

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t take me back
What’s wrong with you, Wrong with you
Don’t take me back
What we gonna do, gonna do
What’s wrong with you, Wrong with you
What’s wrong with you

[Chorus]
Look around, Look around
Look around, Look around
Look around , Look around
Don’t stare at me too long
Look around, Look around
Look around, Look around
Look around , Look around
Don’t stare at me too long

[outro]
It’s been day dreams, of the dream
Won’t you please please
Take my heart away from this life
I feel life in the end stays still
Keep it in the heart the pains real
Tried so hard to keep my ways
Keep my pain away from you
