[verse]
Don’t run towards me
I never did let you down
Don’t come applaud me
Now that you see the crown
You been sitting there hoping one day for a Rollie
You be sending Texts out toh me for me to call yeah
You been praying that I come back on those cold days
But I’ve just been planning to ball
Me clan on the road
Yeah
You cannot fuck with me now
You cannot fuck with the sound now
Been fucking the bitch that you “don’t hate”
And getting her start like 4play
Her voices are on the whole tape
I’m it I’m hot I’m kinda saucy
I know you feel this I know you love it
I know you feel it I know you me

[Chorus]
Walk away walk away
Walk away like I did wrong
Seem like you like being alone
Especially when you wrong
Walk away walk away
Walk away like I did wrong
Seem like you like being alone
Especially when you wrong
I pray you can save yourself from you
I pray you can save yourself from you

[outro]
Don’t run towards me
I never did let you down
Don’t come applaud me
Now that you see the crown
