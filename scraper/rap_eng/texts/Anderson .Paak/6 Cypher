[Verse 1: The Flan]
Yeah, no time for loss, a serious game
I snap, crackle and pop, boy, you hearing these flames?
It’s too many trynna be different, yet appearing the same
I shifted the stick, I guess that means I’m gearing for change
Ahead of the pack, these rappers know I’m better than that
Nobody really wants you like the slice of bread in the back
They claim to be hot, I’m askin', "Where the evidence at?"
But you probably just got it twisted like the medicine cap
Okay, bird’s eye view, I probably just keep on dropping shit
Up a bunk bed, my goal is to stay on top of shit
You're not in conversation, I basically make the topic switch
All I want are dubs, lots of ‘em, that’s word to Popovich
‘Cause I’m at the top of the chain
Ironically, you the pendant, at the bottom you hang
Like constipation, ain’t shit coming, wallow in shame
The bandwagon’s leaving, it’s cool though, you could follow the train
I’m out

[Verse 2: Van Hill]
If I hear one more time that these niggas say they're next
I'mma act like a vampire
Niggas walk around campfires telling stories to each other
Thinking that it’s scary as fuck
Smoking on Christmas trees everyday, so we’re merry as fuck
Let him play his shit, tell him to his face that he sucks
I’m as blunt as the shit that Wiz don’t smoke
Pass it to the kids, hope those kids don’t choke
I’m as wavy as the Titanic, now let that sink in (ha, yeah)
I’m as wavy as the Titanic, now let that sink inside the ocean
Fuck these niggas, fuck these bitches, ‘cause you never really know the motive
I got bars like Motorolas, milkin' every situation into frozen yogurt
Momma told me, "If the rules ain’t bent, don’t bend ‘em"
Let 'em know that it’s time to go to yoga, man I feel like Yoda
Trade the lightsaber for a soda, that’s just me bein' a nigga
I’m sorry for me being niggerish, but really I just wanna be nigga rich
Niggas act like bitches, bitches act like niggas, so it’s hard to tell the differences
I’m a rapper, I just wanna be a simple kid
Man, I’m just swaggin' on this beat
Swaggy P with the shot, point four on the clock

[Verse 3: Pryde]
Real shit, real
Look
I made five figures off a fucking shirt
Moral of the story, know your fucking worth
I’m the wasteman captain to beat the boy’s time
Only rapper you know that ain’t got a cosign
And I ain’t pushed a brick before, never was I dealing weight
If I’m pushing bricks I swear that shit is gon’ be real estate
All I do is invest, bitches don’t show interest
‘Cause I ain’t got no big Benz, it’s cool, I’m making racks though
Still her MCM without no abs though
Leaping like the last stage of tadpole, I’m past go
Phone-E on the track, got me repping for the Bramp’ though
I don’t rep the Dot, but Toronto’s still my fam though, asshole
Light work, every verse is easy done
My crew do it 2XL, your crew do it smedium
Phone-E hold the burner, let it pop at the fakers
Ain’t got the trey pound, but stay down, this shot’s for the haters

[Verse 4: Ricky Rain]
Okay, I know you don’t like me
I’m more likely to be more liked than you
Don’t lie, it’s true and to me you are lion’s food
Close your eyes, I’m about to shed this light on you
For the money, I’ll just probably put this knife in you
Drain the life from you, or would you like me to
Ignite the fire and light you?
"Good night," you too
I’m just saying a lot of crazy shit that I’ve been through
I’m in tuned and I’ve been told the flow is cold
Your flow is wack, your flow is bog’, I told you that
The Rain is here, the Rain is back
Anybody in the motherfuckin' game get slapped
And I could probably pull your dame with no strings attached
And I just came attached with that Mac-11
And when I aim this strap and I clap the weapon
Your whole brain goes splat, if I ever feel threatened
I’m like

[Verse 5: Devon Tracy]
Your girl gets stretched fast like she’s late for yoga
Tings everywhere, I ain’t talking Jamaican soda
Feds pull us over, try to make their quotas
Little do they know their sons and their daughters quote us
Oh shit, flow lit, glow sticks
Couldn’t miss the fam even if you was homesick
Fasten your seatbelts ‘cause I brought the whole clique
Young niggas, we takin’ over the whole 6
Woah, I ain’t never met a cool hater
Way up, I blow O’s size of moon craters
Boy, I got more lines than some school paper
Never got my degree but I’m too major
Man, this summer I’mma snap like photo clicks
All this bread around me like a Pogo stick
Gon' turn me to a mogul quick, she don’t want no local dick
She want a nigga on some global shit
Walk through looking like I sold a brick, so legit

[Verse 6: Anderson]
Yo, Phone-E!
Bucket hat on ‘cause I’m a real-ass nigga, ah-lie, fam?
It’s your boy Anderson, let’s get it, nigga
Uh, probably the most underrated, man, you could ask
And most of y'all just some rookies, my nigga, you need some practice
Yeah, I be balling like March Madness
And if I like your girl, I make her Uber to Brampton
Nah, that ain’t your girl if I still got her
I always hit it till she busts like a piñata
You’re the type to wife a hoe, we don’t save 'em
But y'all some funny niggas like 4YallEntertainment
Catch me on the full run while I’m swerving
In the driver’s seat, getting head like a turban
And she suck me till I bust like a field trip
I gave you niggas twelve months and you’re still shit?
I’m too arrogant, I do what I like to
Only at certain times, I have class like in high school
I’m well-known around the city like the mayor
I don’t need advice, save your tips for the waiter, what’s up
If I ain’t hit you with a verse, then I’m probably busy
Or in the condos makin' money out in 'Sauga city
Man, class in session, homie, the break's over
Anderson and Phone-EG, nigga, the takeover

[Verse 7: Phone-EG]
Fuck it– yo, fuck– yo, Phone-E, calm down!
Fuck it!
Phone-E like your necklace, leave you neckless for your necklace
I’ve always been reckless
And I like that Nexus, hit you unexpected, leave your face in your breakfast
Phone-E hit the rooms, grab all the chains and the pendants
Watch, rings and golds, and I took your bed set
And best bet, it came with your bitch named ‘Lexis
Now ‘Lexis, come take a ride in this Lexus
Now get this endless penis in your precious
Senseless is the size but it’ll slide like Tetris
I told her, "Say, 'Ah'," call me Phone-E the dentist
Or Phone-EG cardio, I leave her breathless
But switch the flow up, because I’m tired of that
Gun heavy, shoot the sky if I want your hat
And if I see you on the map, then it’s Mortal Kombat
I’m like Raiden when I…
O– o– o– is– is that the end of the beat, Sunny?
Alr– okay, next song
