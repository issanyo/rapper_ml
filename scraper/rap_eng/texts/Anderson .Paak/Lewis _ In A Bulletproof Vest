Underneath the sheets with the curtains closed
Try not to awake
Your neighbor's dog through the garden walls
No way to escape

Tell me what it feels like
Tell me does it feel alright

Hypnotized in the bulletproof vest
Trying to forget
What's the silhouette on the concrete floor
Leave it all unsaid

Tell me what it feels like
Tell me does it feel alright
Tell me what it feels like
Tell me does it feel alright

Tell me what it feels like
Tell me does it feel alright
Tell me what it feels like
Tell me does it feel alright
