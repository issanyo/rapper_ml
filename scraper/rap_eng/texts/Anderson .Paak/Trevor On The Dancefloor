He's too young to be important
Mister DJ on the run
Puts his finger on the trigger
Music is his loaded gun

Plugs the headphones in his walkman
Second-hand but never used
He just found it at the same place
Where he also got his dancing shoes

Discotek on a saturday night
People turn their heads when he's walking by
He's not exactly a stereotype
I know you are surprised
I know, 'cause I'm surprised too

He goes crazy on the dancefloor
Come on people, make some room
Just like Michael does the moon walk
He's got the moves and the attitude

Now he goes out every weekend
Wakes up late in the afternoon
Gives his hair that special treatment
He's got the wax and the cheap shampoo

Discotek on a saturday night
People turn their heads when he's walking by
He's not exactly a stereotype
I know you are surprised
I know, 'cause I'm surprised too

Tonight, are you dancin'?
There is a chance you'll run into Trevor Benson
His moves are not that complicated
Is it the way he walks that makes the world goes round?

Discotek on a saturday night
People turn their heads when he's walking by
He's not exactly a stereotype
I know you are surprised
I know, 'cause I'm surprised too

Discotek on a saturday night
People turn their heads when he's walking by
He's not exactly a stereotype
I know you are surprised
I know, 'cause I'm surprised too

Tonight, tonight are you dancin'
Come on and meet Trevor Benson
