Look

Look at her

Look at her through the window

She's so small.

She's the only one I could think of.
She's consuming my mind.
Pretty face with plum lips .

I have to

I have to go to the shitter

I have to go to the shitter to paint my smile.

I like the way she says things.

Maybe when I can handle the pressure,
I'll take her to a walk up a mountain.
(push her off push her off)
Push her off this newly discovered City!

Heavy lungs with water
Heavy lungs with water.

I have to go

Look at her now.

I have to go look at her now.

(STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!)

Get it over with

(Rip it off like a band aid!)
