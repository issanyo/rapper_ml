We've come together where the buildings rise
We're crawling up where the concrete meets the sky
We walk in line
We've come together in our daily grey
Where all our private boxes look the same
In every possible way

We've been running on the asphalt lately
Killing time is oh so easy
Tell me, how do we determine left from right?

I can't explain where the building rocks
Growing up where the traffic never stops
Oh the rising stars
Sell our souls when the market's right
Shake hands as we're pulling down the blinds
It's almost fine

We've been running on the asphalt lately
Killing time is oh so easy
Tell me, how do we determine left from right?
We've been missing out on daylight lately
Killing time with late night TV
Tell me, how do we determine grey from white?

We keep on running but we're losing time
We spill our coffee where the concrete meets the sky
We keep on moving but we're losing ground
We spend our money as the road keeps winding down
And down

We've been running on the asphalt lately
Killing time is oh so easy
Tell me, how do we determine left from right?
We've been missing out on daylight lately
Killing time with late night TV
Tell me, how do we determine grey from white?
