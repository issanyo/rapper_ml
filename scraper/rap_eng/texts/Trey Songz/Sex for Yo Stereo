[Verse 1]
When you see me in the videos babe
Do I make your body go crazy?
Or when you catch me in a magazine baby
Do you rip me out and save my page?
If my voice comes through your speakers
And you legs suddenly get weaker
This is for you, yeah
I'm hoping it's gon' get you through
So I can get to you
Tell me what you see when you think of me
I want this to be just like your fantasy
Oh, girl, girl I'm coming over
Got some things to show ya, turn your stereo up

[Chorus]
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up, don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it
Now put your hands on the radio
Don't be scared to touch it
Imagine I was there
Baby, pulling on your hair
Got some sex for your stereo
Show me how you take it
My words move like hands
And I'm singing to you naked
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it

[Verse 2]
Now can my ladies in the back make some noise? I see you
It don't matter where you are in the crib, at your job, or in the car
It's for you, this is for you
Wherever you can stick me in, just let the record spin
Baby it's on you, what you gonna do?
Choice is all yours, you can put me in fast-forward or
We can start the record over
Can you feel my words creeping up your legs taking off your clothes?

[Chorus]
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up, don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it
Now put your hands on the radio
Don't be scared to touch it
Imagine I was there
Baby, pulling on your hair
Got some sex for your stereo
Show me how you take it
My words move like hands
And I'm singing to you naked
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it

[Bridge]
Now you need a little bass
So let me give you a taste
I want you to feel my sub-woofer
Baby when I give it to ya
Now you need some highs
So I'ma make you touch the sky
Ooh girl, now slide your body near
Girl take them headphones
Come a little closer
So I can hear you when you moan
Now let me just adjust your knob
Turn it 'til I get you hot
Get you hot, get you hot
I won't stop, oh

[Chorus]
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up, don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it
Now put your hands on the radio
Don't be scared to touch it
Imagine I was there
Baby, pulling on your hair
Got some sex for your stereo
Show me how you take it
My words move like hands
And I'm singing to you naked
Got some sex for your stereo
Girl, you wanna bump it
Turn it up don't turn me down
Promise that you'll love it
