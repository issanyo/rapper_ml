[Verse 1]
She said that these niggas just don't impress her no more
She done seen it all before
She don't wanna deal with it
Says she wants some real shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Said that she was tired of the lames
And the games these niggas be playing
Say she's ready for a change but she just gave me the brains
So I can't believe a thing she's saying
I got a problem and she's the solution
She give me her body, don't give me excuses
She said it's a body, I know what to do it
And giving her heart's just been useless

[Chorus]
Okay, I'm on it baby
You got my loving 'til the morning, baby
Don't give a fuck, we in the moment, baby
Always with a new one 'cause it's so hard to choose one
Bad girls ain't ever been good for me
Good girls ain't ever been enough for me, yeah
Bad girls ain't ever been good to me
Good girls ain't ever been enough for me

[Verse 2]
She said that these niggas just don't impress her no more
She said the niggas ain't shit so the niggas can't hit
Niggas never stress her no more, woah, yeah
Me and this cutie got really acquainted
You thinking 'bout getting your booty done, ain't it?
Maybe one day, baby you'll become famous
I can't tell what's fake or what's real no more
I can't tell if I even feel no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Said that she was tired of the lames
And the games these niggas be playing
Say she's ready for a change but she just gave me the brains
So I can't believe a thing she's saying
I got a problem and she's the solution
She give me her body, don't give me excuses
She said it's a body, I know what to do it
And giving her heart's just been useless

[Chorus]
Okay, I'm on it baby
You got my loving 'til the morning, baby
Don't give a fuck, we in the moment, baby
Always with a new one 'cause it's so hard to choose one
Bad girls ain't ever been good for me
Good girls ain't ever been enough for me, yeah
Bad girls ain't ever been good to me
Good girls ain't ever been enough for me
