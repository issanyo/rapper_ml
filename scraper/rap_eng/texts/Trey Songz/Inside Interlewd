[Verse]
Girl, you so beautiful
I love the way you feel inside
But I don't want you to think, I just want your body
I want all of you, of you
I don't want nobody more than you, no
Just want your body, I want all of you, yeah
Sweat dripping off your body onto mine
Don't it feel, don't it feel good?
Ain't nothing better when I'm inside
Girl, we doing what we doing very well
So, deep inside, deep inside your love
Deep inside
