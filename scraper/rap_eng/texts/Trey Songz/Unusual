[Intro: Trey Songz]
Now I wouldn't be me if I ain't get a little nasty
Na na-na na na na na na
Na na-na na na na na na
Na na-na na na na na na
They say all I talk about is sex

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
How 'bout we just move over and do it where we at
How 'bout you just lift that skirt up ooh, we can be bad
That place that ain’t been touched, I’m feeling on it
I'll let you sit through, keep spinning on it, girl
Giddy up, get it up, take me on a ride to ecstasy
You don’t wanna bump bump then take a nap
You just wanna bump bump bring right back
Watch me
I'ma heat it up, beat it up, oooh

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Know you’re tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not coming with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I wanna do the freaky things you never do
What if we get it while your friends was in the room?
Is that too hot for ya?
Don't you feel bad, let 'em feel sexy
We can make a sex room wherever we go
Take it to the restroom, they ain’t gotta know no
Watch me heat it up, beat it up, wo hey
Do you hear me girl?
Watch me heat it up, beat it up, wooh

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Know you’re tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not coming with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Restaurant, check
Cinema, check
On the hood, check
Of the car
Counter top, check
Balcony, check
In the jet, check
On the beach, leggo

[Verse 3: Drake]
This that other shit, you know you ask for it
I might just send you some money to getcha passport
So you can come to me city, I’ll take you all over
And hit you on the balcony, just don’t fall over
Send me a picture baby, you know I’d never leak it
I know you got somethin' recent, for someone decent
Why you laughing out loud? I’m serious
Bring your girl if you a little bi-curious
Please, please no storytellin' to others
I promise you gon' love it, I would never let you down
Feel like I might of perfected, all the things that you’ve expected
And you gon' know it when you bring your ass around
Motherfucker, oh

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Know you’re tired of the usual, usual, usual
I can give you more than the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual
I'm not coming with the usual
Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch
You gon' feel something unusual

[Outro: Trey Songz]
Get it all different kind of ways
All different places
Look at the many love faces you making
But can you take it, oh
