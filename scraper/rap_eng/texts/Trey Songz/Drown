[Intro: Victor Oladipo]
Drown in your love
Hell yeah, babe
Down, down, down, down, drown
Drown

[Verse 1: Victor Oladipo]
What if I was made for you to enjoy?
And it's just for you and only you, your sex toy

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I got that work, but sexin' you my hobby
Now I need you every day
I love the way she ride me, yeah
I love the way she ride me, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: Victor Oladipo]
And I wanna drown in your love
She said "Hell yeah, babe" (Take it, take it)
Take you down, eat you up (It's so good)
Eat you up, babe
And I go down, down, down, down, drown
Every time I go down, down, down, down, drown

[Verse 2: Victor Oladipo]
Give me your body, it was made to explore
Put my hands 'round that waist, put the cake in my face
Said "It's yours" (Said, "It's yours," cake, cake, cake)

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I got that work, but sexin' you my hobby
Now I need you every day
I love the way she ride me, yeah
I love the way she ride me, yeah yeah yeah

[Hook: Victor Oladipo]
And I wanna drown (Drown, drown) in your love
She said "Hell yeah, babe" (Take it, take it)
Take it down, eat you up (Eat you up, baby)
Eat you up, babe
And I wanna drown in your love (Drown, baby)
She said, "Hell yeah, babe" (Drown, baby)
Take it down, eat you up, eat you up, babe

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, she got that wet wet, know I'm trying to slide right
Ooh, I'm 'bout to, ooh, I'm 'bout to
Ooh, I'm 'bout to dive right
Dive in, times ten
Again and again and again and again and again

[Pre-Chorus 2: Trey Songz]
You know I got that work, but sexin' you my hobby
Splash, make it squirt every time you ride me, yeah
I'm going underneath, yeah, whoa, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Victor Oladipo & Trey Songz]
And I wanna drown in your love
She said "Hell yeah, babe" (Take it take it)
Take it down, eat you up (It's so good)
Eat you up, babe
And I wanna drown in your love (Drown, baby)
She said "Hell yeah, babe" (Drown, baby, take it, take it)
Take it down, eat you up (It's so good)
Eat you up, babe
And I go down, down, down, down, drown (Every time I go down)
And I go down, down, down, down, drown (Ooh, ooh, yeah)
