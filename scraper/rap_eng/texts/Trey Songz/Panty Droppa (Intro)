[Intro]
This right here's a panty dropper
Whoa oh, whoa oh oh oh oh oh
This right here's a panty dropper
Whoa oh oh oh, yeah, whoa oh
This right here's a baby maker
Can I sing my song?

[Verse 1]
If you up in the club tryna get a rub
Then you need to tell the DJ to put this song
Put-put-put-put this song, put this song on
Let me tell you what it is, put away the kids
Time to get it up, get a cup fill it up
Feeling on her booty, touching on her butt
Time to get her back to the crib, beat it up

[Pre-Chorus]
We been spending time, wanna make you mine, oh oh
When you're not around you're still on my mind, oh oh
And I hope this ain't surprising that I been fantasizing
This ain't no joke, let me clear my throat, ahem

[Chorus]
I wanna make love to you
This right here's a panty dropper
This is my panty dropping love song
Nothing but your heels on, loving you
This right here's a baby maker
And we'll be making babies tonight
I wanna make love to you
This right here's a panty dropper
This is my panty dropping love song
Nothing but your heels on, loving you
This right here's a baby maker
And we'll be making babies tonight

[Outro]
I'm ready
