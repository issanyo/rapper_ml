Nigga, she ain't even wanna turn the lights off 'cause she wanna get it on cam
Nigga, she ain't wanna turn the turn the mic off 'cause she know a bitch too bad

[Pre-Chorus]
It's 100 degrees, I got hundreds to throws

[Verse 2]
Throw that ass in the Uber, throw that ass in the Uber
Tell the driver hurry up

Tell the driver hurry up
Finna do something to ya, finna do something to ya
Face down ass up

[Chorus]

You know you got it, ooh you wrong girl, let's do it right

Nigga, we ain't even make it up the staircase, she already came two times
Nigga, we ain't even make it through the doorway, she already open wide
Nigga, she ain't even wanna turn the lights off 'cause she wanna get it on cam
