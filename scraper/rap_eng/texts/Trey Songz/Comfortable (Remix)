[Trey Songz:]
It's just entertainment!

I'm not saying this to blame you I'm saying
I'm not saying this to play you I'm saying
It's all good when we making love
All I ask is don't take our love for granted
It's granted My love for you is real
If you don't love me somebody else will
Baby girl don't you ever oh no get too
Get to comfortable

Now ain't the bed comfy when you sleep
Don't your ass stay here for the free
It's the year of the G tho
You know how I be tho
Kick your ass out
And then I'm foul like a free throw
Call me crazy like Cee-Lo
4-5-6 chicks waiting like ceelo
Listening to them hoes
Get the boot like Timbo
Be missing the green
Like a fein for the indo
Don't act all low like limbo
My pie your slice like kimbo
Leave me and you dumb
Then slow
Gimme back my shit like a rental
Get out my face like a hair that's ingrown
Lotta brains never took you for a bimbo
A lotta lames you was rolling with a pimp tho
And I let you ride like I ride instrumentals
So you was saying you gonna leave me
Well take your time be easy
Cause girl you could never play me
Even if you listening to a Trey Day CD
Before I eject your disc
Let me know you this
I'm a family guy truly
But I could give a fuck about the dog or Stewie

[Hook:]
I'm not saying this to make you upset
I'm not saying this to play you I'm saying
It's all good wanna break it off
All I ask when I'm taking off
That you handle it
Can you handle it
I don't need you for real
And though I loved you
Somebody else will
Cause you mustve got to comfortable

You know I got a lot a love for ya
Like I’m on drugs for you
So addicted but I know I can kick this
That’s why I’m talking big shit
The way you lick them lips and ya hips would say
Nigga I know you gone miss this
But baby I wonder
How you gonna sleep without ya sleep number 69
Freaky time
You get it on the normal you and I were porno live
We got it in all night
And I tell you this
The way you talking all that mess
Make me wanna pull up that dress
Bend your ass over on the furniture
You think that you gonna leave wit
I all inside you secrets you say keep it
While I go deepest in ya river
Get to flowing better than that nigga jigga
Going all in and then it bend like tigga
Ya be on ya job getting hard like liquor
So whats up baby you gonna pack up
Or you gonna fall back what
You wanna do
I wanna do you right now
Baby make a move

[Hook]
