[Trey speaking]
You know sometimes in life
When you, when you’re going through things
You’re having problems
You just wanna know how to live that
Let the top back ride with a beautiful woman, you know what I mean
I know some of you are like: fuck no
I know what you mean and I can feel that but ay

[Hook]
Ridin’ to the music
This is how we do it all night
Breezin down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to aston martin music, music

[Hook]
Girl I would have came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that’s right
I will never know

[Trey Songz Verse 1]
Should I go back to the woman
That had my back at the moment
Before the moment when everybody else got on it
What if I was stuck in the hood
Rolling skinny blunts
Doin’ hand to hands
Baby seats and strollers in my mini van
Who the fuck am I kiddin’
This how I’m livin’
Different cities every day
Boy you know it’s different women
See i’m growing as a business
And I’m sitting on some millions
Missing Thanksgivings
Got the bank flippin'
You don’t understand my reality is different
Addicted to this life yet life’s what’s missin’
Yeah, let that manifest man i’m just in another world ridin with you girl

[Hook]
Ridin’ to the music
This is how we do it all night
Breezin down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to aston martin music, music

[Hook]
I would have came back for you
I just needed time to do what I (got a lot of shit going on) had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that’s right
I will never know

[Trey Songz - Verse 2]
And listen I figure it’s only right
That I been getting to this money
‘Cause I feel like for so long
They have been trying keep it from me
So many different women tell me that they love me
I just tell them keep it
From me
‘Cause that picture could get ugly
Passionate as ever but my heart is tough as leather
See the pain in Tremaine
Sometimes bury the pleasure
But whatever
Cheddar, I was raised be about it
Say you can’t leave with it
But I can’t be without it
Yeah I think that I’m the shit all the time
If you don’t then do you, that’s some shit you need to get off your mind
You don’t think that you’re the shit can’t sit in my ride
That’s why I keep a bad bitch in the ride

[Hook]
Ridin’ to the music
This is how we do it all night
Breezin down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to aston martin music, music

[Hook]
I would have came, would have came (yes I would) back for you
I just needed time (I wanted time, wanted time) to do what I had to do
Caught in the life(caught in the life) I can't let it go
Whether that’s right
I will never know

But here goes nothing
Aston martin music, music
Aston martin music, music
Aston martin music, music
