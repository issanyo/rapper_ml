{​​​​Intro}​​​​
I’m the only one
To make your body
I’m the only one
To make your body
I’m the only one
I’m the only one
To make your body
I’m the only one
I’m the only one
I’m the only one
I’m the only one
To make your body cum

{​​​​Chorus}​​​​
I’m the only one
I’m the only one
I’m the only one
To make your body cum
Make your, make your body

{​​​​Bridge}​​​​
Should’ve never told me
Should’ve never told me that girl
Should’ve never told me
Cause I know you be coming back girl

{​​​​Verse 1}​​​​
Fingers in your hair,staring in your eyes
Kissing everywhere, right down to your thighs
And I know what to do, you know what to do too
Get you in a mood, treat you like my favorite food
Wanna rock a boat, let me take you for a cruise
Take me on a ride
When you ride, I drive, drive you crazy
I show you, you my favorite
You my baby
I go deep and I go deep
But then I’m deep
But then I sleep inside the bed’s all wet,the bed’s all wet
Ain’t another nigga make you spread like that, can he?
You can pretend that he’s me but he ain’t gon’ be (no)
You can pretend that he’s me
But he ain’t gon’ be, no but he ain’t gon’ be

{​​​​Chorus}​​​​
I’m the only one
I’m the only one
I’m the only one
To make your body cum
Make your, make your body

{​​​​Bridge}​​​​
Should’ve never told me
Should’ve never told me that girl
Should’ve never told me
Cause I know you be coming back girl

{​​​​Verse 2}​​​​
Drip drop, drip drop
And the clock keep going like tick tock
While I lip lock your sweet spot
That clit spot (muah, muah)
Tongue it down, slow then I tongue it down faster
Nasty, bout to get a little nastier
This been a long time
Tell me you’re still mine
Cause they don’t do it like I do it
If you said a nigga did then you’re lying
Break it, break it down
Do it real slow, real slow
Tell me, tell me now
How it feel though, feel though
When it comes to making you ooh
I know what to do

{​​​​Chorus}​​​​
I’m the only one
I’m the only one
I’m the only one
To make your body cum
Make your, make your body

{​​​​Bridge}​​​​
Should’ve never told me
Should’ve never told me that girl
Should’ve never told me
Cause I know you be coming back girl
