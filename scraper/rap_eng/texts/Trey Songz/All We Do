[Verse 1]
Just me, top down, on the way to the beach
Four bad chicks in the middle of the street
Roll right up and they all hopped in
Now we in the sand havin' lunch on me
Told the girl, "Don't let your feet get wet
We about to grab some drinks and head to my condo, you can be my weekend guest", oh
I'm in her head so I know we're 'bout to get started
One thing led to the next, now she got her hands all over my body, eh

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't tryna stop and I know she with it
I can see it in her eyes, she been down from the beginning
And she can't leave me alone 'cause I drive her body crazy
I done gave her a little taste now she wanna have my babies

[Chorus]
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
Got three bad friends and they all on me
Now me and baby girl been chilling all week
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
That's all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep

[Verse 2]
Now we on the balcony chillin'
She lovin' the view when we smoke, I'm lovin' it too while I stroke
Got the stars looking down on us, do it 'til the sunrise up
Beat, beat, beat, take a drink, go to sleep, she a freak, she can get it right up, get it right up
Man shorty like the Energizer
She just wanna ride, she ain't never tired
She cookin' naked, eggs and some bacon
After I eat that, I treat that, then eat that again, and again, and again

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't tryna stop and I know she with it
I can see it in her eyes, she been down from the beginning
And she can't leave me alone 'cause I drive her body crazy
I done gave her a little taste now she wanna have my babies

[Chorus]
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
Got three bad friends and they all on me
Now me and baby girl been chilling all week
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
That's all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep

[Bridge]
Posted up in that 305, yeah you know it's just me and my freak
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Posted up in that 305, yeah you know it's just me and my freak
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep

[Chorus]
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
Got three bad friends and they all on me
Now me and baby girl been chilling all week
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
That's all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
