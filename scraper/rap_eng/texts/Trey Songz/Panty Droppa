This right here's a panty-dropper
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This right here's a panty-dropper
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, yeah, whoa-ohhh
This right here's a baby-maker
Can I sing my song
If you up in the club tryna get a rub
Then you need to tell the DJ to put this on
(Put-put-put-put this song, put this song on)
Let me tell you what it is, put away the kids
Time to get it up, get a cup fill it up
Feelin on her booty, touchin on her butt
Time to get her back to the crib, beat it up
We been spending time, wanna make you mine (oh-oh)
When you're not around you're still on my mind (oh-oh)
And I hope this ain't surprising that I been fantasizing
This ain't no joke, let me clear my throat (a-a-hem)
I wanna make love to you
This right here's a panty-dropper
This is my panty-droppin love song
Nothin but your heels on, lovin you
This right here's a baby-maker
And we'll be makin babies tonight
I wanna make love to you
This right here's a panty-dropper
This is my panty-droppin love song
Nothin but your heels on, lovin you
This right here's a baby-maker
And we'll be makin babies tonight
I'm ready
