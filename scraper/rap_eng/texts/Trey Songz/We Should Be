[Intro]
Baby, you're looking so lovely
I'm thinking 'bout you loving me, kissing me, touching me
Looking so lovely
I'm thinking 'bout you loving me, kissing me

[Verse 1]
I promised you, I'd take you out
Enjoy your night out on the town
Light dinner and some champagne
You deserve the best of the finer thangs
Girl, tonight you couldn't look any better
Amazingly irresistable
I can see it in my mind, baby, you and I
Later on tonight, making love

[Chorus]
DJ's playing the last song
We've been dancing all night long
Wanna hold you in my arms
Girl it's time that we get gone
Can't control it any longer
'Cause the feeling's just too strong
Baby you know
It's such a beautiful thing
Way that we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
We should be making love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Most gorgeous lady in the room
I know you can feel all eyes are on you
I think they all are a little envious
Of this chemistry that we share between us
So, I don't wanna come off disrespectful
But I can't keep my hands off of you
Girl, I'm all over your love and if I can lay it down
Then right here on the ground, I'd start making love to you

[Chorus]
DJ's playing the last song
We've been dancing all night long
Wanna hold you in my arms
Girl it's time that we get gone
Can't control it any longer
'Cause the feeling's just too strong
Baby you know
It's such a beautiful thing
Way that we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
We should be making love

[Bridge]
Maybe in the car, babe
Or maybe we could stop some place
'Cause I don't wanna wait, hey
Until we get all the way home, no, no
You got me hard, gripping in the third lane
And girl it's only for the sake of your love, your love
And all I see is us
Making love 'til the sun comes up
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
Doing it, doing it

[Chorus]
DJ's playing the last song
We've been dancing all night long
Wanna hold you in my arms
Girl it's time that we get gone
Trey can't control it any longer
'Cause the feeling's way too strong
Baby you know
It's such a beautiful thing
Way that we be doin' our thang
When we be doin it
We should be making love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I just wanna make love to you
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I just wanna make love
Oh baby, you're looking so beautiful
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it, we should be making love
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
Beautiful thang in this world
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
Our love
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
We should be making love
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
It's such a beautiful thang
Way we be doing our thang
When we be doing it
