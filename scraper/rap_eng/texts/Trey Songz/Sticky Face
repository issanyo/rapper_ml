[Verse 1:]
Ah ah ah ah...
Gunna lick lick lick u up
Gunna beat beat beat it up
Gunna eat eat eat u up
Put them legs up on my shoulder
Eat it like a vulture
I'm a gunna make your love
Make your love come down now
I'm a make it vibrate (blurrr)
With ma tounge
I'm a make it vibrate(bluurrr)
Till u cum
Gotta take my umbrella out and get ready
Bout pull down squirt out really heavy

[Hook:]
Stckyy face
Sugar so sweet can I get a taste
Strawberry whip cream on my cake
Don't I put a smile on your pretty face with my sticky face
Sticky face headin down town to my faviorte place
Gotta appaitie for your candy
And I'm a put a smile on your pretty face
With my sticky face

[Verse 2:]
Whacha doin girl I'm feelin kinda horn-ney
Madda fact girl I'm feelin kinda hungry
Apple vibe girl gunna heat you up
Ice cream dippin down gunna lick it up
My tounge moves faster than a cheeta... cheeta
Had them legs shakin like a seizure seizure
My old man taught me how to keep her eat her
If you don't lick it she gunna leave ya leave ya

[Hook: x3]
Sticky face
Sugar so sweet can I get a taste
Strawberry whip cream on my cake
Don't I put a smile on your pretty face
With my sticky face
Sticky face headin down town to my faviorte place
Gotta appaitie for your candy
And I'm a put a smile on your pretty face
With my sticky face
