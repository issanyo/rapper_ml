[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I got some time for you tonight
I got some more for you tomorrow
Good lovin' all in the morning
My time is yours, if you want it
The seconds, minutes all ticking
Baby, you can have 'em all
I, I, I got nothing better to do
Oh girl, tell me what's better than you

[Chorus]
Better take a moment to make some babies with you
Rather not miss a second, not when I could be with you
Ooh, I got the time for you, I got the time
Ooh, I got the time for you, I got the time
Yeah, got the time, morning, noon, night
Time, any time you like
I got the time, time
I got the time, time, time

[Verse 2]
Time just stops, I don't see no one
Hands goin' round while my hands rub you down
Busy, busy, busy, busy schedule
For you, I'm never too busy, just to let you know

[Chorus]
Better take a moment to make some babies with you
Rather not miss a second, not when I could be with you
Ooh, I got the time for you, I got the time
Ooh, I got the time for you, I got the time
Yeah, got the time, morning, noon, night
Time, any time you like
I got the time, time
I got the time, time, time

[Bridge]
Got the time
Time, I got the time
I got the time, time
I, I got the time
I got the time
Got the time, I got the time
I got the time for you
That's what you need, then you got it from me, baby
Oh, I got the time
I got the time
I got the time for you
I got the time
I got the time, time
Time for you if you want it
Never leave disappointed
Time for you if you like it
Time for you to get excited
Time for you in public
Time for you in private
My time is yours
When it's yours, I'll be inside it
Time for you to be classy
Time for you to be nasty
I got the time, I got the time
You ain't never gotta ask me
Rolex, Hublot
Audemaur, got 'em all
Giving you all of me
And you can get some more, yeah yeah

[Outro]
Once I hit the door
Clothes his the floor
Will we make it up the stairs?
Girl, I'm never really sure
Scream as loud as you can
While my hands round your throat
We cancelled the plans
Just to cancel some more
I got time, I got time
I got time for your mind
I got time for your head
Lie you down on the bed
Take it all right there
Take it all right there
Take it all right there, yeah
Take it all right there, yeah
