[Chorus]
She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions

[Verse 1]
Guess it's my fault for not believing she could love, love me
Hard to believe I treated someone beautiful so ugly

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I broke to pieces her heart
Got used to seeing her crying
Guess I went and pushed it too far
She got sick and tired of me lying, yeah

[Chorus]
She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions
Now she's gone, gone, gone
I should've listened, but I didn't, me and my bad decisions
She said she move on, on, on
And now I'm tripping, I should've listened, me and my bad decisions

[Verse 2]
Now I got time to think of all I could've done different
Searched the whole world until I realized the one I needed was right there, I was tripping
Wanna what I know you know I love you
Don't I, never took the time to tell you
So I, know that shit don't even matter right now
'Cause I'm the reason that your heart's shattered right now
And I, I know how to fuck a good thing up
Ain't I, ain't that why I'm 'bout to lose your love
But that shit don't even matter right now
'Cause I'm the reason that your heart's shattered right now

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I broke to pieces her heart
Got used to seeing her crying
Guess I went and pushed it too far
She got sick and tired of me lying, yeah

[Chorus]
She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions

[Bridge]
God knows I've done some wild and crazy things in my past
And I can't take nothing back
Can't take nothing back, forced to live with that
Pay the price for making bad decisions

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I broke to pieces her heart
Got used to seeing her crying
Guess I went and pushed it too far
She got sick and tired of me lying

[Chorus]
She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions
Now she's gone, gone, gone
And I know that I should've listened but I, me and my bad decisions
She said she move on, on, on
And now I'm tripping, I should've listened, me and my bad decisions
I fucked up, no, no, yes I did
Me and my bad decisions
Ain't no way I could take that back
Me and my bad decisions
