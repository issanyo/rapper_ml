[Verse 1: Kehlani]
You so damn important
Everything you do shows me you know it
Behind it all you are the motive
Don’t tell you enough, but baby I'll show it, show it
He say he the king where he come from
Take a young queen just to know one
So, baby, I’mma drive it like it’s stolen
I’mma fix it like it’s broken
We could catch a flight out to London
Go to the mall, spend a lump sum
They could try to catch up to us
But they’re too busy making assumptions

[Bridge: Kehlani]
Boy, you know all I do
Is stay up all night losing sleep over you
All I do
Is drive myself crazy thinkin' 'bout my baby

[Hook: Kehlani]
It’s the way you walk, the way you talk, babe
It’s the way you love, the way you fuck, the way
It’s the way you are, you're a star, babe
It's the way you, it's the way you are

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
You got my mind gone, trippin'
You know I love these women
But you make me feel different
Just had your love, still miss it though, still kiss it slow
Give me some more
She know I'm the king where I come from
She know she the queen, she the one one
But she got a nigga open
Make me feel like I was chosen
Oh, just when my heart had got frozen
She opened the door and she strolled in
She got the key and she closed it
She got with me and now I'm focused
Girl, you know

[Bridge: Kehlani & Trey Songz]
All I do
Is stay up all night losing sleep over you
All I do
Is drive myself crazy thinkin' 'bout my baby

[Hook: Kehlani & Trey Songz]
It’s the way you walk, the way you talk, babe
It’s the way you love, the way you fuck, the way
It’s the way you are, you're a star, babe
It's the way you, it's the way you are

[Verse 3: Kehlani & Trey Songz]
This thing we got is crazy
Only thing I know is you’re my baby
Forever down, I am your lady
Always for sure, never a maybe
Never met someone who spoke my language
Baby girl I swear I'm tired of playin'
You the type of nigga make me lane switch
I'm the type nigga have you rainin'
Give me your heart and I hold it (hold it)
Show me your soul and I'll mold it (mold it)
Baby boy, you gotta be the dopest (know that)
Gotta be to fuck with the coldest

[Bridge: Kehlani & Trey Songz]
All I do
Is stay up all night losing sleep over you
All I do
Is drive myself crazy thinkin' 'bout my baby

[Hook: Kehlani & Trey Songz]
It’s the way you walk, the way you talk, babe
It’s the way you love, the way you fuck, the way
It’s the way you are, you're a star, babe
It's the way you, it's the way you are
