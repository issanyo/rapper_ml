[Intro:]
And she keep tellin me you know you the shit
Ladies throw ya hands up that's if you the shit
Walk up in the club & they knew I was the shit
Shittin on err'body that's up in this bitch

[Fabolous:]
Pledge alegence to the shit, hands where ya hearts are
Matter fact salute the shit, hands where ya parts are
Still make a fuckin movie, girls gon want they parts on
I get brain in the whip. who needs a smart car?
Call me when it's real beef, fuck all of this hardd talk
Niggas dnt touch keys cept for when they start cars
They jus talkn out they ass those are fart bars
I bring the toaster where ever you pop tarts are
Play with funerals get cha ass burried, you should shut your fruity ass up raspberry
Jus got that rolls royce so this black man, got bitches chasin a ghost ms. pacman
I know ya'll listenin I trace all tabs
I'm buyin Audemars to match my baseball caps
White & navy joint, let's watch the yankees
I'm gettin big deposits, you gettin bank fees
You lil niggas jus remember that you ain't me
Write your award speach & don't forget to thank me
What am I to do know?
They try to be me on wax at Madame Tussauds

[Hook:]
And you know I'm the shit, and you know I don't care what you think about it bitch
Cause ain't nobody, ain't nobody, ain't nobody like me
Ladies askin questions like " trigga one night please? "

[Trey Songz:]
Ain't nobody gettin married, but I am the best man
I will be the greatest, I will except nothin less than
I had 8 of em and that's just in a section, they all swallow & gobble call it digestion
Women dance on my sack call it dickonyx, the shit read lips till it's hookd on vomit
I'm a bragga ya shawty you kno I prolly had her
I'm a born star, porn star, shes a ghetto gagger
Rockin platinum, I never got the plaque
Still I drop 30 grand up at Saks
I made it out nigga you know how the hood be
I got the game sewed up like some good weave
You got it all fucked up like a lacefront
I got the girls gettin low like a base drum
I'm on some rich shit, you on a bitch trip, grab ya purse nigga with cha lipstick
I'm such a dickheadd, they call me arogant
One question... what the fuck you starein at?
I'm the shitt boy you can ask ya home girl, I'm a hold yours that's until I get my own girl

[Hook:]
And you know I'm the shit, and you know I don't care what you think about it bitch
Cause ain't nobody, ain't nobody, ain't nobody like me
Ladies askin questions like " trigga one night please? "

Trey:
I made em a believer now my head big Gina

Beat it up in private & they like it so I'm Ike & call em Tina
Me, Her & Her girlfriend and they dikin have you seen em?
I swear I'm doper then these muhhfuckas realize
Hit he club all black like seal eyes
I am hell on earth, I'm trynna live in heaven
Come fly with me MJ2K11
Look in the mirror & it's clearer than it has been
I talk shit to the homie like he my glass twin
I say don't let them get a head of me, they want them instead of me
But I'm so much better, aye, you know how it better be
I'm a sail pass niggas cruise to a better sea
Same light, same night, but I'm in a better vee
Plus my flow hotter than a hoxtables sweater be
And she talk dirty like a throw away beretta b

Bridge:
Now come and fuck with em, and if you don't really I don't give a fuck
Nigga I'm onn, so catch me if you can, and if you ain't know I don't really give a damn
Shouts to all the girls in the club shakin asses
Shout out to the hood and the furniture with plastic
Now we carry wadds of the cash in the plastic
I got this whole shit mastered
