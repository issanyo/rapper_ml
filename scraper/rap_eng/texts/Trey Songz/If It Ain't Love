[Skit]
Nigga, shut the fuck up. Who you think you talkin' to? Oh, 'cause you Tremaine, think you can do whatever the fuck you want? Fuck outta here. Trey, you know better than that. Don't play me

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
If it ain't love then why, does it hurt so damn good, why?
If it ain't love then why, why, would I give my lives to you?
If it ain't love then why, why?
If it ain't love then why, why? Said you wanna ask questions, babe
If it ain't love then why, why, why, why?

[Skit]
Trey: But you know where I'm at, like what we talk about?
Girl: Nigga, I don't know where you at
Trey: Aw, you pissin' me off but I'm tryin', well, I'm not
Girl: Well, well, you ain't here

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Yeah, yeah, this is like the calm before the storm, yeah yeah yeah
This is like you're laying in my arms
This is that try on the outfit, yeah yeah
Just to take it off
This is like the shoes I just bought you, yeah
Watchin' you preform
Oh, now here we go with the bullshit
Yeah, girl, that's what you be on

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Throwing that old shit all up in my face
Knowing that you don't have much room to say
And I'm always wrong, that's okay
She said that this can't be love, no way
Hold up now, won't you wait one second

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
If it ain't love then why, does it hurt so damn good, why?
If it ain't love then why, why, would I give my lives to you?
If it ain't love then why, why?
If it ain't love then why, why? Said you wanna ask questions, babe

[Skit]
Girl: So this is love, huh? You fuck my friends, you talk to me crazy. Nigga, you a bitch
Trey: I said stop talkin' to me like that. You, I'm tryna be cool you pushin' me and shit, girl
Girl: What you gone do? You ain't gone do shit

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Every time we argue, every time we fight
Don't it feel good when I make it all right?
Girl, you know this all, you know this all mine
You so disrespectful, but it's all fine
I just started talkin' 'til she sayin' nothin'
I just let her win, yeah, end of discussion
Swear that I be in my own motherfuckin' way
Swear she don't judge, that's always the case

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & girl]
Throwing that old shit all up in my face
Girl: Old shit, new shit. Whatever
Knowing that you don't have much room to say
Girl: We talking about you right now. Don't even try that
I'm always wrong, that's okay
Girl: Don't even come at me like that
She said that this can't be love, no way
Hold up now
Girl: Tremaine
Won't you wait one second

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
If it ain't love then why, does it hurt so damn good, why?
If it ain't love then why, why, would I give my lives to you?
If it ain't love then why, why?
If it ain't love then why, why? Said you wanna ask questions, babe
If it ain't lovin' why, why, why, why?

[Outro: Trey Songz]
Now say you gon' stop talkin' to me like me, for real
Now say you gon' stop talkin' to me like me, for real
Now say you gon' stop talkin' to me like me, for real
Yeah yeah
