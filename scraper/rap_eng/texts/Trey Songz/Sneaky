[Intro]
Oh, oh, no
Trigga, Trigga

[Verse 1]
I know just what you want girl
I can see it in your mind when you hopped inside in this bed 'cause I came for your home girl
So we play it off, we never talk
We say it with our eyes
Girl, it ain’t your fault, no, we won’t get caught
We just give it a little time
We can slip away, she could never say
We, more then some fun times
Don’t feel bad ‘cause you want me baby, I want you too
I see you looking, tell me what it do
She ain’t my girl, I swear we cool
We might have fucked, but she ain’t my boo

[Chorus]
I want you now, don’t be scared to get down
You want me don’t ya?
Girl, let’s do some freaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Sneaky shit, sneaky shit, sneaky shit
Some sneaky shit, some sneaky

[Verse 2]
I feel like you need me inside you
Put your number in my phone while she ain’t looking, sitting next to me, while I’m touching on your pussy
Grab that shit, you can have that shit
Dope dick doctor, I’ma give you a prescription
It’s such a good night and I’m leaving in the morning
I can put you on a flight, that's if you really, really want it
She don’t have to know nothing
You know I'm ‘bout to have you cumming?

[Chorus]
I want you now, don’t be scared to get down
You want me don’t ya?
Girl, let’s do some freaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Sneaky shit, some sneaky, freaky, deaky shit

[Bridge]
Now we've been partying hard, drinking a lot
She don’t even notice, I’m thinking of how
I wish she was you, I wish she was you
And we've been partying hard, hop out that car
She says she see me tomorrow and I text ya phone, like come on
I wish she was you, I wish she was you

[Chorus]
I want you now, don’t be scared to get down
You want me don’t ya?
Girl, let’s do some freaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Sneaky shit, some sneaky, freaky, deaky shit

[Outro]
They ain't even gotta know
We can do it on the low
And it feels so right that it gotta be wrong
Girl, I wanna make your body blow
Ain't my fault who your friends with
Girl, that ain't none of my business
Your body's on my wishlist
Baby, come and get it
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Girl, let’s do some sneaky, sneaky, freaky shit
Sneaky shit, some sneaky, freaky, deaky shit
