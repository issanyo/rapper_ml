This goes out to the beautiful girls
Which one of y'all, which, which one
Which, which one of y'all
Which one of y'all goin' home with Trigga?

I see you at the club, ooh, shawty
Walkin' past a nigga lookin' at me all naughty
Then I said, "Baby, wassup?"
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug

Bottles of the Ace got me with a lil' buzz
Up in VIP with all my thug niggas
You leaned over and said you want me

Girl, when the valet pull the Benz up
Off to the crib, shawty, where we gonna end up
Girl, sit back, relax, hold up
Let me turn the radio on

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think

Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex

Put the code in the gate, pull up to the driveway
Said she like the way I touch her, listenin' to usher
(Yup)
I got a confession
(What?)
Know we 'bout to sin, but your body is a blessing
(Father, forgive me)

Girl, can we take it up stairs
(Up, up, up stairs)
My bed's waitin' there
(Waitin' there, yeah)

All I want to do is
(All I wanna do)
Is give you all of me
Won't you give me all of you?

I want your body like right now
(Right now)
You know I live a magnum lifestyle
(Lifestyle)
Baby, turn the lights down
And I'mma turn you on

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

Girl, when I pull back them sheets
(Take the covers off)
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
'Cause I do it like I did
You gonna think I invented sex

It's a celebration clap, clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of Moscato
For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this

Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out

Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it

Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself

Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think

You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
