I was born by the river in a little tent
And oh, just like the river I
I've been running ever since

It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change's gonna come
Oh yes, it will

It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there no, no
Beyond the sky

It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh yes, it will

Then I go to my brother
I said brother, help me please
But he winds up knocking me down
I got to go to my knees

Oh, there's been times that I thought
I wouldn't last for long
But I think I'm able to carry on

It's been a long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Keep it right there
