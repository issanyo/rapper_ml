"One big room full of bad bitches"

If it's a cutie with a booty
It be Gucci Louis Prada
If he doubt her, it don't matter, I'mma beat her like a father
Gucci Gucci Gucci oochie wally oh my gaga
Sit-sitting pretty let me treat him like a bye bye

Big ass room full of bad bitches
I mean one big room full of big ass bitches
Pretty in the face, but some thick ass bitches
With the pussy in their face and they lick ass bitches
Once you got the banger and you standing in the doorway
.44 play for a trick ass nigga
He'll pop that monster, god, right up in this hallway
Leave this muthafucka looking something like Norway
Apologize, never know what I'm gonna say
I sympathize, but I'm so desensitized
When some real shit happen I just put it in a rhyme
And you only making shit happen after dinner time
Nigga I'm puttin on, they say that's Virginia time
And every time she give me dome, I say I'm in her mind
Big money making hoes so you all seem ?
Then I let my sons run in somebody's daughter
I'm in..

"One big room full of bad bitches"

If it's a cutie with a booty
It be Gucci Louis Prada
If he doubt her, it don't matter, I'mma beat her like a father
Gucci Gucci Gucci oochie walie oh my gaga
Sit-sitting pretty let me treat him like a bye bye

One big room kicking it: kung fu
You niggas ain't here cause you niggas uncool
She gave a nigga face so I made her cum too
She made a nigga late, but I never cum soon
? keep the fingers so tense
Last time I made it rain, man, I left them hoes drenched
You niggas ain't in the game, man
You niggas on the bench
You make my celly rang if you really wanna hit
Bet he mentioned Trey's name if he looking for his bitch
Some people on the road ask how it come to me
I told em that the flow actually runs through me
Revealed this is real as a real dude who's filming the movies
Then they ask about the money and the groupies I go dummy
I go groupie, I throw hoes in the jacuzzi
That coochie super-juice, I love you like I love Lucy
And you beef ? never knew me
Up in..
