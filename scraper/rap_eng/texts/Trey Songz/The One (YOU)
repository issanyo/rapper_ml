Oh Oh
Yeah Yeah
Yeah-eh

Walking underneath the moon
The feeling I'm feelin it feels right
The way my heart beats beats on the inside
I think of you and and think of the times we've spent
I Think of us together until we both die
I think of you and your style and your hair and clothes
But baby it's your heart and the way that you make me feel the most
I Think of us together and how we are close
And I Just Wnated You To Know

Girl it's you
I Swear You can change me and make my whole life
Baby it's picture perfect and I know that we can make it
Through
All Of the problems that come in sight
I swear I never get tired of arguin and fighting with you
Cuz there is just one time
One time for you to find the one you love and the one that loves you
And I've been spending my life lookin for my boo
I've been spending my life lookin for the one and that's YOU
