(Trey Songz)
You Know I ball so hard Atlantic will never trade me
And You niggas could never play me
I run the game, these lame, no name ass niggas never be where Trey be
Ball so Hard this shit dumb
I’m so cold, wrist so numb
And this for sure as I was born in ’84
That with my whip alone can make a bitch cum
Ball So Hard, I’m Amazed, Ya’ll so fired, I’m so paid
Ball So Hard, Since I’m On, It’s only right that I put on
Go Trey, Ok, I Go OJ, Crazy Shit
Sip Some, and then some, I Lynch Some, Can’t Hang With this

Ball So Hard, Got a New Safe, Goes well with my new place
They Freaking, I’m beasting, Ball So Hard, I’m about lose weight She wanna have sex, screw face, Touche, What You say
You heard me certainly, She gave me Top A.K.A Toupee
Mercy me Moi Excuse, Stuff Two Pretty birds in the coup-e
I’m in the zone, niqqas better shoot me ‘fore I kill another track
It’s getting too crazy
That shit Cray, Ain't it Yay? Ain't It Jay?
I’m nice ass shit, Ya’ll like this shit
How I Ike this bitch so Anime

She said “Trigga thought You said you knew Hov?” (I Do)

You are now fucking with Songz
