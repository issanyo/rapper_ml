[Verse 1]
Lover]s lane sex driving you my Lamborghini
Ferrari painted lips red, eyes blue martini
Pop your trunk, lift your hood, take your top off
And let’s pop off on this autobahn cause my Audemar clock’s off
No curfew, my great coupon sex registry
We race through dupont in 5th gear
I shift gears, see the checkin flag
That lets me know I won
I got a girl named Porsche, I got a freak named Alexis
Hood chick named Mercedes, she love the bands out of Benzes
She love the bend front of lenses
14 milimeter, get a close up
She love me in the winter time
Cause my new york state of mind let my engine never froze up
But enough about cars, I wanna get inside your panties and your bras
And please leave them high heels on
I can see that they all loubuttons
Let your fine ass ride me
I fit inside your glove nicely
You going off a long island ice tea
You perform on the mike so precisely
Might check one cizzle, might lick your candy if you drizzle
Might come in handy, if you dribble I’ma take you to the hole
And pass you to young drizzle

[Hook]
Here we go, we’re here again
I wanna know, how you’ve been
Such a surprise, didn’t think you’d come back so soon

[Verse 2]
Electric lady, you leave and you come right back
And this a shock to my system baby
How you learn to move your body like that
You must have been a balee dancer
Your coreography’s tight
Your legs so thick like you run track
I wouldn’t mind if you spent 2 nights
Got a bottle or 2 on ice
There’s a problem with you I like
When you on that molly, go so nympho
I don’t even mind when you bite
And the night’s young, so you can light one
Until you’re high strong
I got a vice grip on your nice bum
I might eat you down to your pot crumbs
Social club, we at the frat house
Got a chick chapter at the cat house
So wear your g string and your black blouse
So I can dig a whole in your back out
You can text me or hit the land line
Blow me up to my girl like a land mine
But god damn that ass fine
So if you here right now then that ass mine

[Hook]
Here we go, we’re here again
I wanna know, how you’ve been
Such a surprise, didn’t think you’d come back so soon

[Verse 3]
You brought a friend with you
Girl you so generous
That other friend with you
Oh that’s your medicine
Well I’m a bit surprised, it’s kinda like it’s my birthday
A 2 for one special, I needed that love in a worst way
So let’s proceed at a slow speed
Get so high till our nose bleeds
You on codeine, I’m on your and her like a dope fiend
It’s so mean how you grind on me
I even love it when you do a line on me
And if I got court you lie for me
But for now since you here just climb on me
And ride on me

[Hook]
Here we go, we’re here again
I wanna know, how you’ve been
Such a surprise, didn’t think you’d come back so soon
