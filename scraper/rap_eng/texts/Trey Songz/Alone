[Chorus]
Shawty we been sipping on bub
And I done had enough, let's get up out this club
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone
Shawty we been flirting all night
And once we outside, can I offer you a ride?
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone

[Verse 1]
Twinkle twinkle little star
Over there standing by the bar
Would you mind if I came to where you are?
Where you are?
When I look in your eyes girl, you're telling me yes
And when I look at the way your booty poke outta that dress
Naw, naw, girl don't try to hide it
I'm on my way over there stand right beside it
I wanna know how you doing, what's your name?
Girl, this chemistry we share so insane
Girl, you know what's happening, me and you just laughing
Plus my phone done died so put your number on this napkin

[Chorus]
Shawty we been sipping on bub
And I done had enough, let's get up out this club
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone
Shawty we been flirting all night
And once we outside, can I offer you a ride?
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone

[Verse 2]
Beautiful, gorgeous
I ain't tryna buy your time, I can't afford it
What I'm tryna do is paint a pretty portrait
Me and you, a chariot ride with horses
I done came a long way from white tees and Forces
And as a man I understand we can't force it
But if I walk you outside where the Porche is
I'm tryna take you back home to my fortress
Woman, take my hand, tell me what's your name
Girl, this chemistry we share is off the chain
Tell me what you think, you and I been laughing
Baby girl, I'm asking for a night of passion

[Chorus]
Shawty we been sipping on bub
And I done had enough, let's get up out this club
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone
Shawty we been flirting all night
And once we outside, can I offer you a ride?
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone
All that I'm thinking

[Bridge]
All I'm thinking, how can we get alone alone alone?
Just you and me baby, alone alone alone, just you and I
And once I get you, I'ma kiss you, I'ma touch you
'Cause you're soft as tissue, when you leave me I'ma miss you
Gotta get you alone alone alone alone

[Chorus]
Shawty we been sipping on bub
And I done had enough, let's get up out this club
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone
Shawty we been flirting all night
And once we outside, can I offer you a ride?
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone

[Outro]
I hope you're cool with that
Just you and I, girl
