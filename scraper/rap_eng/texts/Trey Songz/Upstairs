Yuh!
Well lil' mama, let's get up out this living room (okay)
Girl, I want to put your body on a pedestal (okay)
And if you want me to I'll do the things your man won't do (I will)
Baby, I'm gon make your dreams come true

I'ma hit it from the front (front), back (back)
So girl cut off that TV
Any way you want (want), girl ask (ask)
Tonight I'm feeling freaky
So I'm hoping you're ready to take off your clothes
And if you feel the same way, girl, then follow me

Upstairs, girl tonight you know it's gon be on
Cause both of us are grown
So bring your ass upstairs
I hope the radio rewind this remix
Girl, I really need it
So you ready?

Girl, come up these stairs with me (okay)
I was sick of love but you might be my therapy (okay)
In the morning, I just hate when you prepare to leave (okay)
So baby, put your back back down

I'ma hit it from the front (front), back (back)
So girl cut off that TV
Any way you want (want), girl ask (ask)
Tonight I'm feeling freaky
So I'm hoping you're ready to take off your clothes
And if you feel the same way, girl, then follow me

Upstairs, girl tonight you know it's gon be on
Cause both of us are grown
So bring your ass upstairs
I hope the radio rewind this remix
Girl, I really need it
