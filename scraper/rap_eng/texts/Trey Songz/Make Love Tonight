[Verse 1]
Excuse me woman but it's something on my mind, I gotta get it off my chest
Baby girl, I must confess and I'm tryna say it with finesse
And it won't take nothing, just a little bit of time and a body up inside your dress
I promise it will be the best and baby I ain't talking sex

[Chorus]
So can we make love tonight? Ooh girl
Get the champagne popping off tonight
Vicky Secrets coming off tonight
So can we make love tonight? Tonight
Bubble bath with only candlelight
And massage your body, bet you'll like it

[Verse 2]
'Cause you gon' feel it from the minute that you walk in the room
I'll have the candles burning while the water's running and the music's playing, there'll be no delaying
Outside it's raining but it's cool
Cause I'll just pull you closer and hold you tighter and I'll say to you

[Bridge]
Let's take this night for loving
And make it last 'til morning
We'll be touching and we kissing
Freaking so can we

[Chorus]
Now baby, can we make love tonight? I just wanna make love
Get the champagne popping off tonight
Vicky Secrets coming off tonight
So can we make love tonight? Tonight
Bubble bath with only candlelight
And massage your body, bet you'll like it
Can we make love tonight? Come on, let me love you down
Get the champagne popping off tonight
Vicky Secrets coming off tonight, baby let me know
So can we make love tonight? Can we baby? Tonight
Bubble bath with only candlelight, I'll have them bubbles running
And massage your body, bet you'll like it

[Bridge]
Baby sing it with me, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, can we
Let's take this night for loving
And make it last 'til morning
We'll be touching and we kissing
Squeezing, so can we
Let's take this night for loving
And make it last 'til morning
We'll be touching and we kissing
Squeezing, so can we

[Chorus]
Can we make love tonight? I just wanna make love to you
Get the champagne popping off tonight
Vicky Secrets coming off tonight, they're be coming off, way off
So can we make love tonight? I just wanna feel you
Bubble bath with only candlelight, I'll have the bubbles running
And massage your body, bet you'll like it, I'ma get them oils and rub your body
Can we make love tonight?
Get the champagne popping off tonight, get it popping baby
Vicky Secrets coming off tonight, you'll be lingerie free
So can we make love tonight? If you know what I mean, no sex, just love, you and me
Bubble bath with only candlelight, I'll have them bubbles running
And massage your body, bet you'll like it
Can we make love tonight? And make it last
Get the champagne popping and the Secrets dropping
And it ain't no stopping while our bodies rocking
If you on top then, girl you working
Now it's morning and the birds is chirping
We still going, we still going, we still going, we still going
