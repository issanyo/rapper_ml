[Hook: Trey Songz & (T-Pain)]
Gettin' money, whole lot of money
They got their own, ain't want nothin' from me
Niggas wanna see 'em, bitches wanna be 'em
Ay, get your drink up, bad bitches gon' link up
(Them bad bitches gon' link up, them bad bitches gon' link up)
(Them bad bitches, them bad bitches, them bad bitches gon' link up)
(Them bad bitches gon' link up, them bad bitches gon' link up)
(Them bad bitches, them bad bitches, them bad bitches gon' link up)

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Pecan, puerto rican, blackanese
All my bitches steppin' in Louboutins, spend a couple racks on them jeans
LIV on sunday, King Of Diamonds Monday
They not goin' in no club unless they comin' out with that money
They spend it, they spend it, they winning, they winning
Got a bad clique, you ain't a bad bitch then you ain't 'bout to be in it
I be drippin' of the murder, bitch you know you want a picture
Comin' out, straight bummin' out, but they turn around when they see her
(Bad bitches gon' link up) and we gonna do whatever we think of
Got bitches all in Bugatti's at my crib to come and pick me up
(Bad bitches gon' link up) you know how many bad hoes I own?
I got pimpin' in my blood, somebody get Taz on the phone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Trippy... trippy
Thumbin' through a check with a bad bitch, she's a hollywood actress
Don't worry 'bout what we doing ho, all you need to know is we cash checks
My other bitch is a supermodel, and her pussy gets super wet
Me, her and my actor bitch 'bout to have us some group sex
Bad bitches gon' link up, patron shots gon' drink up
We ball out all week long, you broke niggas can't keep up
I make it rain I gotta sweep up, she suck it slow and then speed up
Poolparty on the rooftop, you need a helicopter to see us
Ballin' out cause I'm rich as fuck, ballin' out cause she pissy drunk
You ain't imagine that loud pack then hell no you can't hit the blunt
Pullin' up in my foreign car, that spare tire go in the front
Damn right I got my hood behind me, that purple stuff all in my pot

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Aisha lemme lick up on that cat
Hit it while you kissin' on that, get it from the back
I keep a bad bitch to breed bad bitches back
Pretty in the face with a ass hella' fat
Bad bitches link up, bad bitches wassup
And if you mad bitch it's cause you average so shut the fuck up
Get your drink up, pretty blowin' that's stink up
Strokin' forever need her, you broke, you gon' never meet her, see them
(Bad bitches gon' link up) and I'mma try to fuck them all
Then I tell her bring some more, I'mma let 'em buy the mall
(Bad bitches gon' link up) and for every bitch that I own
That ever texted my phone like, "can you bring some bitches home?"
This for y'all

[Hook]
