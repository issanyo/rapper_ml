[Verse 1]
I wish I was there more than I am, babe
These lonely nights take a toll on a man
You donâ€™t understand it
It's so unfair that Christmas is all throughout the air
And I hate that we're both alone
I'd rather be with you by the mistletoe

[Pre-Chorus]
It hurts me more than what you think it does
When nights get cold, that's when I miss your touch
The snow is falling and it won't let up
Okay, I'm on my way, hey

[Chorus]
Cause it'll be nothing without you
Christmas will be nothing without you, girl
So I'm coming home, yeah, I'm coming home
Yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
It'll be nothing without you, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm ready to go, packed up and 'bout to hit the road
It may not be at the time that you want, but I'm coming, baby
Wait a little bit longer and I'll be there before you know
So tonight, just wait up for me
Don't you dare try to go to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
It hurts me more than what you think it does
When nights get cold, that's when I miss your touch
The snow is falling and it won't let up
Okay, I'm on my way, hey

[Chorus]
Cause it'll be nothing without you
Christmas will be nothing without you, girl
So I'm coming home, yeah, I'm coming home
Yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
It'll be nothing without you

[Bridge]
So I'm coming home, yeah, I'm coming home
Yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
So I'm coming home, yeah, I'm coming home
Yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
Coming home, yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
Coming home, yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
So I'm coming home, yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love
Coming home, yeah, I'm coming home to the one that I love, yeah

[Verse 3]
As soon as I walk through the door
Baby, all that I want is to see you with nothing but a ribbon on
Let me show you how it's supposed to go
No, it ain't the north pole
Sit on daddy lap, girl, ain't no getting off
I'm sorry that I took so long, but I'm so glad that I came on
It may not have been when you want
But the love so good, you'll forget it by the end of this song

[Outro]
Coming, coming home
Coming home
I'mma be there, I'm
Said I'm coming home, coming home
Coming home to the one that I love
Oh, baby, girl, I'm so damn glad that I'm coming home
I'mma be there, I'mma, I'mma, I'mma be there
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Merry Christmas
