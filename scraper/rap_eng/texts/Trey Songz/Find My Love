[Chorus: Justine Darcenne & Trey Songz]
I've got my mind on you
Want my body on your too
I know the things that you need, you want
I can't believe even when you're done
Now won't you find my love
Now won't you find, won't you find my love
Won't you find my love
Won't you find, won't you find my love
I just wanna find love, I just wanna find love, yeah
I just wanna find love, I just wanna find love, yeah
I just wanna find love, baby, show me some love, yeah
I just wanna find love, baby, show me some love, yeah

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Heart beat in my chest, that don't I'm less about that
She say she love me, that don't mean I don't doubt that
I want that for real, love a nigga like for real
She say that she got me, I say, "Maybe, probably"
Oh, it feels like I'm running outta time
I want something special, want something I can call mine
I got the baddest, I keep the baddest baddies on my line
But she say that she different, got me loose and she say

[Chorus: Justine Darcenne]
I've got my mind on you
Want my body on your too
I know the things that you need, you want
I can't believe even when you're done
Now won't you find my love
Now won't you find, won't you find my love
Won't you find my love
Won't you find, won't you find my love

[Verse 2: MIKExANGEL]
Heart beat in my chest, that's been broken but I bounce back
She say she need me, won't leave but, but I doubt that
Tell me that it's real, won't you love me like for real
You say that you want me, don't you disappoint me
Ooh, it feels like I been wasting all of time
I got baddies baging my line
I got baddies waiting in line, like a diamond, you shine
Like the homie, you ride, give you love on my mind

[Chorus: Justine Darcenne, MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
I've got my mind on you
Want my body on your too
I know the things that you need, you want
I can't believe even when you're done
Now won't you find my love
Now won't you find, won't you find my love
Won't you find my love
Won't you find, won't you find my love
I just wanna find love, I just wanna find love, yeah
I just wanna find love, I just wanna find love, yeah
I just wanna find love, baby, show me some love, yeah
I just wanna find love, baby, show me some love, yeah
