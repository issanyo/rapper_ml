[Verse 1]
Baby, I'ma be straight up, don’t waste no time
I know you ain't my, you ain't my baby
Do you think about us?
Do I cross your mind anytime?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you, you’re taken
It’ll never change 'cause it’s always been that way
But you know that you can’t fake it
He can’t give you what I got here right now
Girl, I know what you want
No phones, we ain’t even gotta talk
Next time that he leave you all alone
I’m gon’ come through, replace him
I’m gon' watch you get naked
I’m gon' tell you, girl, take it
Next time that he leave you all alone
I’ll give you all the love he did not, I’m about to take his spot

[Chorus]
Let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
So let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back, back

[Verse 2]
Baby, let me tell you what’s up
I don’t trust that nigga, fuck that nigga, stop bringing him up
Baby, I ain't never gave no fucks
One fuck’s too much, unless you’re talking about us

[Pre-Chorus]
But, I know that you, you’re taken
It’ll never change 'cause it’s always been that way
But you know that you can’t fake it
He can’t give you what I got here right now
Girl, I know what you want
No phones, we ain’t even gotta talk
Next time that he leave you all alone
I’m gon’ come through, replace him
I’m gon' watch you get naked
I’m gon' tell you, girl, take it
Next time that he leave you all alone
I’ll give you all the love he not
I’m about to take his spot

[Chorus]
Let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
So let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
I’m back

[Outro]
I’m back
I'mma watch you get naked
I'mma tell you to take it
Let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
So let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back (is back)
I’m back…
