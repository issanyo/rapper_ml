[Intro (spoken)]
Good evening
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out
Hope your flights were safe
Feeling real breezy, swift like the wind

[Verse 1]
It's calling my body, yeah, it's calling my soul
It's calling my mind, girl I gotta go
Baby it's the grind, yes I had a good time
Don't get me wrong, you were so good and I really wish I could
Stay a little bit longer, love you a little bit stronger
And go a little deeper, baby with you
But since this thang is calling I gotta answer dry your eyes
Girl don't cry 'cause you're making it hard for me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to leave, ooh girl but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it

[Verse 2]
So hold that thought, don't you move
See I'm coming right back, right back for you
Don't you change your position, girl I'm on a mission
And baby trust I'll be missing, missing you 'cause I don't wanna leave

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to leave, ooh girl but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it

[Bridge]
Streets be calling me, they be calling my name, baby
And when they call I gotta go, so I'm letting you know
I won't be gone for long
And already, I can't wait to come home to you

[Chorus]
I don't want to leave, no baby, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it
I don't want to leave, no, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave, but I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it

[Interlude (spoken)]
Break it down, down, down
Nah, I don't wanna leave
But you know hit it is when-
Whoa, baby, keep that on
Don't take it off
Keep it on so I can take it off when I get back!
*laughs*
Yeah, fa'sho
You better believe that!

[Chorus]
I don't want to leave, no baby, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it
I don't want to leave, no, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave, but I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it
