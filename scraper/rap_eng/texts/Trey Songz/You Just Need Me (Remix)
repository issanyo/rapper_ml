I made this one for your girlfriend
This one for your girlfriend
Oohho oohho
You gave him your love (your love) oohh
Showed him something that he never had before
But he didn't want your love (your love) no
So you started over and your on own
But that ain't so bad, baby your in luck
Cause it so happens that I'm looking for love
So why don't we take a little time
To see if it's for real (to see if it's right)
You don't need nobody to night
You just need to rock with me tonight
Girl you don't need no man tellin you that you can
You don't need no one else baby cause here I am
You just need me girl
(I know just what you need)
I got just what you need, and I'll give it to you
I want you to see girl (I know just what you need)
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you
You just need me girl
To pick you up and show you round
When ever we up baby it's my town
I'm on the way come on get up
Took off my sweats and put up the truck
Throw on my polo pull out the drive
Step in your heels put on a top
Get ready
You don't need no body tonight
You just need to rock with me tonight
Girl you don't need no man tellin you that you can
You don't need no one else, baby cause here I am
You just need me girl
(I know just what you need)
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you
I want you to see girl (I know just what you need)
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you
You just need me girl
I swear the world stops spinning when your around
I take my time every minute to love you down
Give me your smile and forget I made you frown
Take a chance girl I'm telling you
That I could be the one for you
I gone do what he can't do girl
Let me be you the one to show you love
Be the only one your thinking of
Love is blind so you can't see
But you just me
You just need me girl
(I know just what you need)
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you
I want you to see girl (I know just what you need)
I got just what you need and I'll give it to you
You just need me girl
You don't need nobody to night
You just need to rock with me tonight
Girl you don't need no man tellin you that you can
You don't need no one else baby cause here I am
