[Verse 1:]
I'm coming through to meet ya
Girl I can't wait to see ya
Just stepped up out of Magic
I'm feeling like an addict
I need a little touch-up to help me go to sleep
Sugar I'm about to pull up, buzz the gate for me
I step off through the door, stumbling from all the sipping
I pull you to the floor, you hide from all the kissing
Oooh I know you with it, so let's take it slow
I brought you a ticket baby, I'm gone do a show

[Pre-Hook:]
Baby you the juice, watch me be the gin
Hit it like a nigga who just got up out the pen
From the floor to the kitchen
Kitchen to the bathroom
Bathroom to the shower
Take a break and bring it back in an hour oooh

[Hook:]
I'm in my zone tonight, I'm feeling alright
I got this wine in me, I got that weed in me
And girl I'm feeling like a soldier, wanna do it rough
I know you like it when I hold you, girl I wanna oooh
Make it rain tonight
And I ain't talking bout no money girl
I'm a make it rain tonight
And I ain't quitting til I get it right

[Verse 2:]
Now baby stand up
Put your hands against the wall while I kiss down your spine
I'm sure you know where I go from here
And I know you feel when I'm kissing in your kitten
And I know you gone be tripping when I step inside your love
I just wanna love
Oooh the closer I get to you
I said it keeps on getting better and I love when we're together

[Pre-Hook:]
Baby you the juice, watch me be the gin
Hit it like a nigga who just got up out the pen
From the floor to the kitchen
Kitchen to the bathroom
Bathroom to the shower
Take a break and bring it back in an hour oooh

[Hook:]
I'm in my zone tonight, I'm feeling alright
I got this wine in me, I got that weed in me
And girl I'm feeling like a soldier, wanna do it rough
I know you like it when I hold you, girl I wanna oooh
Make it rain tonight
And I ain't talking bout no money girl
I'm a make it rain tonight
And I ain't quitting til I get it right

[Verse 3:]
Baby you're [x4] so sweet yes your are
I'm a push [x4] it deep
Til you beg me for more and it hurts to let me go
You say "T-R-E-Y Songz you the king of the world"
Baby you're [x4] so sweet ooooh
I'm a push [x4] it deep
Til you beg me for me to stop and it hurts to let me go
Now say it "T-R-E-Y Songz you the king of the world"

[Hook:]
I'm in my zone tonight, I'm feeling alright
I got this wine in me, I got that weed in me
And girl I'm feeling like a soldier, wanna do it rough
I know you like it when I hold you, girl I wanna oooh
Make it rain tonight
And I ain't talking bout no money girl
I'm a make it rain tonight
And I ain't quitting til I get it right

[Outro:]
See baby when I, when I, when I hit your phone and tell you I'm coming through
You know what it do
I come to give you what you missing
Your love description man your love is dripping
Make it rain tonight
So close your eyes and imagine the best love you ever had
She say "T-R-E-Y Songz you the king of the world"
