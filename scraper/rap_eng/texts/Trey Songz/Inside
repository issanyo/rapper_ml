[Intro]
No, no, no
Aw, yeah, no

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Keep your legs up, keep your legs up
Keep your legs up, girl, keep your legs up
I keep you wetter, I keep you wetter
I know you fed up, I do it better
Let a nigga inside, let a nigga inside tonight
Let a nigga inside, let a nigga inside tonight

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
Let me massage the pussy, we gon' m√©nage the pussy
I'ma reward the pussy, I'ma reward the pussy
Let me remind the pussy, I'ma remind the pussy
Don't hide, divide the pussy, I multiply the pussy
When you call up my phone like you war ready
I'm already strapped up, girl you already know
Where your legs need to go, I ain't gon' tell you no more

[Pre-Chorus: Jacquees]
Up in the air, right there is where I need you
Don't be scared, I'ma take you there, shawty, I believe in you

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Keep your legs up, keep your legs up
Keep your legs up, girl, keep your legs up
I keep you wetter, I keep you wetter
I know you fed up, I do it better
Let a nigga inside, let a nigga inside tonight
Let a nigga inside, let a nigga inside tonight

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Let me massage the pussy, come when I call the pussy
Come when I call your pussy, I just want all your pussy
Lemme remind that pussy, you know it's mine, that pussy
Know how to find that pussy, taste sweet as wine that pussy
Licky, licky, la-la, I'm goin' down there
Got my face in sticky places, go to town, yeah (yah)
Got my head between your legs, you wrap around that (yah)
And when I reach your pretty peach, I'll never drown there

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Up in the air, right there's where I need you
Don't you be scared, I'ma take you there, all I need you to do

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Keep your legs up, keep your legs up
Keep your legs up, girl, keep your legs up
I keep you wetter, I keep you wetter
I know you fed up, I do it better
Let a nigga inside, let a nigga inside tonight
Let a nigga inside, let a nigga inside tonight

[Outro: Jacquees & Trey Songz]
I'll fuck you right I will, I'll fuck you right I will

Let me Inside you babe, let me inside
