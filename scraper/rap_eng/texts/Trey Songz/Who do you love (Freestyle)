I know you don’t love me (uh huh)
You ain’t the same whenever Drake’s around
I know you don’t love me (uh huh)
You scream and holla when CB’s in town

Now I got a Hollywood girl, she stay on McCadden
Think she selling ass on the side (ass on the side)
Got a New York City, big titty, pretty thang
Catch the train to a nigga, she don’t drive (don’t drive)
I’m that nigga, I’m that nigga (I’m that nigga)
I’m that nigga in yo city but a nigga from Virginia (from Virginia)
I’m that nigga, I’m that nigga (I’m that nigga)
And if you niggas done forgot
You niggas bout to remember
You niggas better remember losers never love a winner
Bitches never love a loser, beggars never can be choosers (uh huh)
I’m in the crib playin 2K
New bitch got loose lips, told her like Lupe
You can kick and push babe, why you acting "boojie"?
Free kush, liquor pills its a movie (its a movie)
Call her best friend, skin like D'usse
She got a booty and I made them tell me who they?

Who do you love?

You ain’t the same whenever YG’s around
Bitch, who do you love?
(Know you wanna act a fool when you see that nigga Dolla $ign)
Bitch, who do you love?
Aha, I bet you be a freak for my nigga Meek
Who do you love?

Who do you love?
I bet you let your panties fall quick for that nigga August
