[Intro: Trina]
Uh huh, yeah now this is for all the sexy ladies, show out
Now I am, I am Trina, Trina, 2010, yeah, I'm showing out

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Shawty shut it down when she step on the block
Make me wanna reach into my pocket and throw out all my singles
All my singles, she showing out, she showing out
Shawty showing out, she showing out, she showing out
She showing out, she showing out, shawty showing out

[Verse 1: Trina]
He ain't never seen a 5 star lookin' like this
He ain't never had me, I'm as good as it gets
Got a small thick frame, I spit a lot of game
305 representer of glass off the chain
I'm in the flyest fashion 3-6-5
And ain't no doubt about it, yeah I'm all the way live
See I push a brinks truck so I'm always on full
I ain't waitin' on those lies, 40 acres and a mule
The boys see me comin', you should see 'em make it rain
They get wild with them hundreds, they no 50's ain't my thang
Cute face, nice ass with a lot of class
Them birds stay jealous 'cause they back door trash
Rear view in the past, never let 'em see you comin'
They know I'm in the spot when the crowd start runnin'
I'm carried by the pharaohs, new home out in Melrose
She showin' out again, she the queen baby, hello

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Shawty shut it down when she step on the block
Make me wanna reach into my pocket and throw out all my singles
All my singles, she showing out, she showing out
Shawty showing out, she showing out, she showing out
She showing out, she showing out, shawty showing out

[Verse 2: Trina]
He tryna floss for a boss, chicks spendin' all his cash
Takin' me wherever, told me, "Throw it in the bag"
We went to Bel Harbor, man I made him spend a house
Told him ,"Show me what you got, you a man or a mouse"
He said he a man I said, "Show muscle"
He pulled the black card out and said, "I ain't gon' rush you
You can take your time, get whatever that you  like
And when you finish shoppin' baby, we'll depart and take flight"
I could pick the country where I wanna land
'Cause I was showin' out, he wanna be my man
Wanna take me to Germany, spend a week out in London
Buy me homes out in Paris just 'cause I'm givin' good lovin'
See it's all about me 'cause I'm that he needs
All that money he spends, you'll think it grow out on trees
How I shop out in Italy then I'm back out in Paris
He love my neck to be flooded, a hundred K worth of diamonds, I'm showin' out

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Shawty shut it down when she step on the block
Make me wanna reach into my pocket and throw out all my singles
All my singles, she showing out, she showing out
Shawty showing out, she showing out, she showing out
She showing out, she showing out, shawty showing out

[Bridge: Trina]
Yeah, when I step out, I always keep them lookin'
I'm the entre, 'cause I'm what's cookin'
Showing out everyday like it ain't nothin'
Hopin' out whatever 'cause you know I stay stuntin'
When I step out, I always keep them lookin'
I'm the entre, 'cause I'm what's cookin'
Showing out everyday like it ain't nothin'
Hopin' out whatever 'cause you know I stay stuntin'
You see me in the club, you know I'm showin' out
You see me in the mall, you know I'm showin' out
You see we in the bank, I could never draw it out
'Cause it will take too many days just to have them count it out
Hopin' out whatever 'cause you know I stay stuntin'
You see me in the club, you know I'm showin' out
You see me in the mall, you know I'm showin' out
You see we in the bank, I could never draw it out
'Cause it will take too many days just to have them count it out, I'm showin' out

[Hook: Trey Songz]
