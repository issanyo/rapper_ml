[Verse 1]
She picks up the phone
In my head I know I'm wrong
I just want to know what she's heard
I'm pacing back and forth, cause I know that I've been caught
Trying to think of the perfect words

[Chorus]
So I can come to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
I'ma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
Time is not on our side
'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye
She's waving goodbye goodbye
Smartphones, dumb shit

[Verse 2]
Never knew I call so if she heard it all
I'm all out of luck tonight
I can say it was a joke but who am I kidding she ain't slow
Only way to make it right

[Chorus]
Is if I can come to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
I'ma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
Oh gonna tell you whatever it takes
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
Whatever it takes, take
Whatever it takes
Oh girl
Smartphones, dumb shit

[Bridge]
Don't you wave goodbye goodbye, smartphones, dumb shit
Don't you wave goodbye goodbye smartphones, dumb shit
Aw man I got to think of something
I'm about to lose it all
I swear that shit really didn't mean nothing
It all started with a pocket call

[Chorus]
So I'ma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say, yeah
But I know that I'm gonna say
Whatever it takes
I'ma run to her and lie right to her face
I don't know what I'm gonna say
But I know that I'm gonna say
I'm gonna say whatever it takes
Time is not on our side
'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye
She's waving goodbye goodbye
Smartphones, dumb shit
Smartphones, dumb shit
Smartphones, dumb shit
