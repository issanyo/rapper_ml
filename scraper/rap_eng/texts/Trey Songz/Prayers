[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I've been prayin' for some better days
I've been drinkin' all this liquor too
Every nigga tryna make a wave
I be prayin' for my niggas too
I'm a satan in the Maserati
I've been waitin' like I'm in the lobby
I've been prayin' for the wife type
But Lord knows I've be catchin' bodies
I've been prayin', I'ma make it up
I've been sayin' I don't pray enough
Just came home with a straight mil
But I've been sayin' they don't pay enough
I've been prayin' only women
Lord forgive me, I'm a lost soul
I've been spendin' all my riches
Do it all for the bankroll

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I've been prayin' I'm forgivin'
Treat the man like a mistress
Locked in my own prison
Can't see my own vision
Tryna find me like
Like a nigga gon' miss a straight trip
You see my grandma used to tell me
"Boy say your prayers 'fore you lay"
Make sure
You see my grandma used to tell me
"Boy say your prayers 'fore you lay"
I be prayin', I be prayin', when I see the police now, when I see the police
I be prayin', I be prayin', that they never gun me down, that they never kill me
If I die before I wake
Lord I'm gon' be straight
Prayin' that I see another day
Thank God I done seen another day

[Verse 2: Chisanity]
2Pac nigga, prayin' for me, better days
Two shots for a nigga, seen him just the other day
Mama prayin' that she keep my life insurance paid
Pussy niggas, they hit you any time of day
I'm just livin', Lord forgive me
Benz tinted, now I'm winnin'
I've been prayin', I've been prayin' for a i8
Gotta get my money straight
Nigga get your mind straight, ya gotta get your mind straight
It all come a time and place
But I'm sick and tired of waitin'
Man that shit's so aggravatin'
I wanna ball, wanna ball
Wanna shine today
Wanna hustle 'fore the sun down
Lord knows 'cause it's midnight
You gotta hustle, get it on your own
Now that's somethin' to pray about

[Verse 3: J.R.]
Every time we lose a nigga, we get T-shirts
And I just got some more clothes
Dirty, it's a cold game
And we handin' out these wardrobes
Ever had to look your nigga dead in his eyes?
Too much blood, you can see the death in his eyes
One last hug, voices screamin', "Leave it to God"
But fuck that bullshit you Shareem, you just a bitch or you ridin
Pray for me
It's been one hell of a weekend
We screwed on the red eyes, it feel like we cheatin'
Red dot, red dot
Now them boys look Indonesian
Only thing I'm thinkin' 'bout, my partner prayin' that I squeeze it
Nigga told me grab a strap, put my feelings in a trunk
Blood told me he want blood and I'ma give him what he want
Ay, visions of the box
Guess I'm cool with that, yeah
I promised his mama I'ma get them niggas back
Should the killers
Convicts, and drug dealers all just forget about Heaven?
What about the bad guy?
Beggin' for a blessin', I pray
