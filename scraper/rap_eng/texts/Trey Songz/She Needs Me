I love you

And I need you baby
And you need me too
So, no matter where your love goes
And though she doesn't care
She knows I am there
Cuz' I know how much my baby needs me, yeah, need

Tagging along
But, right

Forever I will be your freind
Oh, your lover
Because when we'll be shining, Ohhhh
Tooooo, to wake up always wake up
And make-a discover
Hooo!

So I will go

And I'll always be there
Tend to your every care
Long as she needs
