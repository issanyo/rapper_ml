[Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm reaching out my heart to you, girl, it's just so hard
I'm wishing I could hold you, but my arms ain't that long
Girl I'm missin' your kisses, missin' your touch
You know this distance makes it harder to keep us close

[Verse 1: Raptile]
Yeah anotha airport drama
I'm leavin' and it's hard to say goodbye, we don't know when we'll meet again
Tears rollin' down your cheeks again
The last kiss has to last longer then the weekend
So weakenin' the last few days
Laughters on our face, more like a masquerade
But we can't cover it up, this shit is too real
Can't even talk, the split is too near
You pop the trunk and check my bag tags
I left my luggage after I strap my backpack
Teary eyes, might drown
I feel like Trey, I don't wanna leave but I gotta go right now
It's always the same, our hands let go
And it feels like the pain brands my soul
My vision get blurry, you drivin' off
And deep inside my heart starts cryin' y'all

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm reaching out my heart to you, girl, it's just so hard
I'm wishing I could hold you, but my arms ain't that long
Girl I'm missin' your kisses, missin' your touch
You know this distance makes it harder to keep us close

[Verse 2: Raptile]
Ten hours later, 7 thousand miles away
I find myself all alone reminiscin'
I feel like something's missin'
But this is my job, I gotta be focused plus ambitious
Sometimes I question all of this, is it worth it?
I'm spendin' most my time out here workin'
Grindin' instead of spendin' all of my time with
My princess my wife my queen
I promise the sweet ones comin' and when I'm comin' home but
Trust it's gon' be a Dunkin' Donut
I hate wakin' up in the middle of the night
And you're not by my side right by my side

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm reaching out my heart to you, girl, it's just so hard
I'm wishing I could hold you, but my arms ain't that long
Girl I'm missin' your kisses, missin' your touch
You know this distance makes it harder to keep us close

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Girl, I think about this love
A thousand times a day
And girl, you're still the closest to my heart
Even a million miles away

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm reaching out my heart to you, girl, it's just so hard
I'm wishing I could hold you, but my arms ain't that long
Girl I'm missin' your kisses, missin' your touch
You know this distance makes it harder to keep us close
This distance makes it hard, oh
This distance makes it hard, hard to keep us close
Girl I'm missin' your kisses, missin' your touch
You know this distance makes it harder to keep us close
