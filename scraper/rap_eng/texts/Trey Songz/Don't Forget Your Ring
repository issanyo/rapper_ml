[Verse 1]
I must be livin on a river
Called stupid
Cause the flow is dumb
Ice on blizzard nigga
I'm a walking cold front
Pretty woman with me with this swoll donk
All she do is roll blunts She don't smoke 'em though
Ass clappin fantastical just like after I close the show
Applaud baby, ya'll may be knowin 'bout this cold ho
Naw mean son Like New York niggas
Bothers them I may have fathered them
Child support, trigga

[Hook:]
Really I understand why nigga mad at me
Seem like all the women throw they ass at me
Sorry but you really know I ain't know
Doin' what I want yeah I'm doin what you can't ho
Everything I am is everything you ain't though
When I'm with your girl I'mma tell you what you ain't know
She jump up on this pole, swing around do your thing girl
And when you leave don't forget your ring girl
Don't forget your ring, don't forget your ring
Don't forget your ring, dont forget your ring
She jump on on this pole swing around do your thing girl
And when you leave baby don't forget your ring girl

[Verse 2]
No disrespect to you husbands
When I lay up with ya woman
We dont be kissin and snugglin'
She just be lickin and suckin'
I put the dick in like fuck it
You know what it is, you know what we did
But she don't come to my crib, I don't allow that
Bring that snow plow back, got some more ice
I need some liquor where the loud at
If life is just a beach this where a lot of niggas drown at
Nah this ain't no circus but i'll show you where the clowns at
Yea they over there, over here in this section
We fresher than a newborn, cut out of c-section
Yes man!
Thats what you got around you
Lost my fuckin' mind they break it down
And what I found ooh
Trigga world renowned
Who woulda predicted this im the illest shit to hit the fuckin mic
MC hit the lights, salt with the pepper black and white
What could be better right
She tell me push it push it
My lil spinderella
I got wine in the cellar
I got bank im no teller
If I bang then dont tell ya friend
Unless she tryna get it in
Losers im sure to win
Put that g code in again
Still im goin in to win
Im just in your lady friend

CHORUS
