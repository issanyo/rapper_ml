[Intro]
Yes, no, maybe
Yes, no, maybe

[Verse 1]
Remember when you used to love me before I even was me
The way you used to hug me, lick me, suck me, kiss me, fuck me
I spent a lot of money on you, I invest in your dreams
I ain't ever fronted on you, girl, you know what that means
It's all mine, all mine, all mine
She said it's all mine
But somehow I knew she was a liar, she was a liar
She's a liar, she's a liar
Am I tripping? Am I bugging?
Is it over? Tell me something
You don't call me no more, who you fucking?
Tell me what it is, tell me what I did

[Pre-Chorus]
Where you go? Are you coming home
Any time soon? Are you coming home
Any time soon? Don't do this to me baby
Yes, no, maybe, yes, no

[Chorus]
But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back
Fuck that, you can stay wherever you at
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, why you playing games with my heart?
Could've sworn that you swore, never change from the start
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, how you gon' try to out me?
Tell me where the fuck would you be without me?
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
Don't do this to me, baby
Don't do this to me, baby
I just wanna know
Yes, no, maybe

[Verse 2]
I've been selfish, I can't help it
Whole lotta years, whole lotta tears
Bullshit that you dealt with
But you let me and you left me
I really think that I would've made you my girl some day
Oh, but how foolish am I to think that you'd have to wait?
Like you never had shit, like you ain't a bad bitch
That could get her ass kissed from a nigga mad rich
But I'm missing that lift, rolling up a spliff, girl, the way your tongue twist
Getting lifted, tripping off dumb shit, you the only one that could make me cum quick
You know, please tell me I love you, please tell me
I hope, please tell me he fucked up too

[Pre-Chorus]
Where you go? Are you coming home any time soon?
Are you coming home any time soon?
Don't do this to me, baby
Yes, no, maybe, yes, no

[Chorus]
But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back
Fuck that, you can stay wherever you at
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, why you playing games with my heart?
Could've sworn that you swore, never change from the start
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, how you gon' try to out me?
Tell me where the fuck would you be without me?
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
Don't do this to me, baby
Don't do this to me, baby
I just wanna know
Yes, no
I just wanna know
Yes, no, maybe

[Bridge]
Seems like I'm having delusions
This cannot be our conclusion
Got it off saying I was done
But when you're in love with someone
You come running, running back
I'm running, running back

[Chorus]
But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back
Fuck that, you can stay wherever you at
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, why you playing games with my heart?
Could've sworn that you swore, never change from the start
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, how you gon' try to out me?
Tell me where the fuck would you be without me?
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
Don't do this to me, baby
Don't do this to me, baby
Yes, no, how the fuck you gon' leave me here tripping?
Yes, no, I miss you, don't make me have to come and get you
Yes, no, yes, ye-yes no baby
Don't do this to me, baby, I'm going crazy
Don't do this to me, baby
Yes, no, maybe
Baby, baby
