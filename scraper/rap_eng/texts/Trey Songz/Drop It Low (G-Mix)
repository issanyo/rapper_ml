[Intro]
Drop it, drop it low, girl

[Verse 1: Diddy & Chris Brown]
Three sprays of cologne, neck, chest and wrist
None fresh as this best, check your chick fella

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Homie, where your girl at? Shawty, where your girls at?
Homie, where your girl at? I know where your girl at
And I'ma never bring your girl back
Never bring your girl back, never bring your girl

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Ester Dean]
If ya ass too big, I make ya back that ass up
I only go down if ya keep your grass cut
Hair to the back, hat to the front
Weezy F. baby, tatted on the butt
Okay, still remixin’ with one of these vixens

Look, I like a nice two pack and a booty on biggie
What's really good? What you know about it?
Swagger too good, I should notarize it

Make the booty clap, give it up for me
Yeah, it’s Young Money, you know I bring money

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
E-E-East low ride, booty big so the thong show
How Low Can You Go? Ludacris song on
Limbo's, Timbo's, V-Neck's, Polo's
Make that booty jump ju-ju-ju-jump for my pogo
Yeah, see the way I ball, no NBA logo
Motherfuckin' swag got a whole lot of mojo
Five top tens, you can say I'm on a row, hoe
Sign a couple autographs, take a couple photos
Long as a flute, baby, tell me can you blow though?
Went under the belt, then she hit me with the low blow
We losing the clothes but this way after the show though
Sex so crazy, Spanish, loco
Now I head home like Daute' Toro
Tracks so gone, zone folk polo, yeah
So what it is, shawty drop it like some kids at her momma's house
I'm about to give her the business
My boys with me, they be looking for a boss
Baby, you the only one I want
Girl, you move that thing like you grown
I want a Nicki Minaj with your clothes

[Chorus]
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
Drop it, drop it low, girl, drop it, drop it low, girl
