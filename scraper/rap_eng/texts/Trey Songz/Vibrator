[Intro: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
Vibe
Yeah, yeah
Vibe
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Trey Songz & MIKExANGEL]
I ain't gotta call, she just came outside
Got the top off, she just hop inside
Yeah, wind in her hair, yeah, she just love the ride
She don't really care, yeah, she just love the vibe
She just caught a vibe, she just caught a vibe
She just caught a vibe, we just caught a vibe
She just caught a vibe, I just caught a vibe
I just caught a vibe, we just caught a vibe

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
We just caught a vibe on the way, feelin' wavy
Met her on the fly, but she feelin' like my baby
One look in her eyes, make me wanna have some babies
We just caught a vibe and I swear this shit is crazy
Ooh, feeling so good, like we in another world
Like I knew you before, am I trippin'? This is different, babe
Ooh, feeling so good, like we in another world
I just need some more, you're addicted, this is trippy, baby

[Chorus: Trey Songz & MIKExANGEL]
She just caught a vibe, she just caught a vibe
She just caught a vibe, we just caught a vibe
She just caught a vibe, I just caught a vibe
I just caught a vibe, we just caught a vibe

[Verse 2: Chisanity, MIKExANGEL, Justine Darcenne & Trey Songz]
I ain't gotta call, she just come outside
Bring the Bentley truck, we just caught a vibe
Feel it in the air, put one in the sky
She give me head while I'm smokin', but she never blow my heart
I ain't got nothin' but time, but been stuck on the grind
10 toes on my own, damn, niggas tryna take me out my zone now
Ooh, feeling so good, like we in another world
Hands grippin' all on round the waist, sauce drippin', we be outta space

[Chorus: Trey Songz & MIKExANGEL]
She just caught a vibe, she just caught a vibe
She just caught a vibe, we just caught a vibe
She just caught a vibe, I just caught a vibe
I just caught a vibe, we just caught a vibe
She just caught a vibe, she just caught a vibe
She just caught a vibe, we just caught a vibe
She just caught a vibe, I just caught a vibe
I just caught a vibe, we just caught a vibe

[Verse 3: MIKExANGEL]
Vibe, vibe
Vibe, vibe
Vibe, when the night turn to daytime
Vibe, 'cause you know I don't waste time
I got a little wine for you (What else?)
I got a little time for you (What else?)
You know I keep you so spoiled (What else?)
I rub you down with that oil
She just caught a vibe, I'ma angel in the office
She want me aside, wanna show me how that mouth feel
Yeah, in the brand new Mercedes, she ain't even my lady
I treat her like my baby
Them other dudes so shady, ridin' round with a boss
Fuckin' round with the stars, take your ass straight to Mars

[Chorus: Trey Songz & MIKExANGEL]
Vibe, we just caught a vibe
Vibe, we just caught a vibe

[Outro: Justine Darcenne & Chisanity & MIKExANGEL]
I ain't got nothin' but time, but been stuck on the grind
10 toes on my own, damn, niggas tryna take me out my zone now
I ain't got nothin' but time, I ain't got nothin' but time
I vibe
