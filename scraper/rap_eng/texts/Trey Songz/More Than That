[Intro:]
Close your eyes, Fantasize
It's gonna be much more than that

[Verse 1:]
Gimme your hand
I wanna feel your fingers on mine
Your gentleman
Tell me can I beat it
Tell me do you need that
Super duper love I got that

[Pre-Hook:]
Ain't nobody can't nobody do your body like I wanna do girl
I'm telling the truth girl
Put your body with my body
You got the thing that I like
I like to think that you might, like this too now

[Hook:]
Close your eyes, fantasize, grab on me, hold on that
Once you dream you gonna see
It's gonna be much more than that
Close your eyes, fantasize, grab on me, hold on that
Once you dream you gonna see
It's gonna be much more than that
Much more than that

[Verse 2:]
Something like a butterfly landing on a rose
I'm gonna let my lips land wherever they go
Kissin from your lips, neck, belly to your toes
Make your body go oooh

[Pre-Hook:]
Ain't nobody can't nobody do your body like I wanna do girl
I'm telling the truth girl
Put your body with my body
You got the thing that I like
I like to think that you might, like this too now

[Hook:]
Close your eyes, fantasize, grab on me, hold on that
Once you dream you gonna see
It's gonna be much more than that
Close your eyes, fantasize, grab on me, hold on that
Once you dream you gonna see
It's gonna be much more than that
Much more than that

[Pre-Hook:]
Can't nobody ain't nobody do your body like I wanna do girl
I'm telling the truth girl
Put your body with my body
You got the thing that I like
I like to think that you might, like this too now

[Hook:]
Close your eyes, fantasize, grab on me, hold on that
Once you dream you gonna see, it's gonna be much more than that
