[Verse 1]
Who knew we would be where we are, here today?
Yeah, who knew that your heart had a cost, I would pay, girl
Ain't gon' be all peaches I thought all through the pain you would stay
I guess, life is no fair no

[Pre-Chorus]
Just listen to me, we can't go on
Pretending to be, like we're so strong
Love, gone, gone with the wind
I've got something to give to you

[Chorus]
Black roses for this dying love
Now we're breaking up, since we giving up
Black roses, an early valentine
Special delivery, just for you and I

[Verse 2]
Who knew our love would ever be called a memory?
Who knew my home for happiness would soon be misery?
Hate that we're so distant, girl, do you even miss me at all?
I guess, life is no fair, no no

[Pre-Chorus]
Just listen to me, we can't go on
Pretending to be, like we're so strong
Love, gone, gone with the wind
I've got something to give to you

[Chorus]
Black roses for this dying love
Now we're breaking up, since we giving up
Black roses, an early valentine
Special delivery, just for you and I

[Bridge]
Can't sleep, can't eat, I can't erase the pain
'Cause I still feel your heart beat, a million miles away
I can't think, can't sleep, I can't erase the pain
'Cause I still feel your heart beat , a million miles away
I can't think, can't sleep, can't eat, I can't erase the pain
'Cause I still feel your heart beat, a million miles away

[Chorus]
Black roses for this dying love
Now we're breaking up, since we giving up
Black roses, an early valentine
Special delivery, just for you and I

[Outro]
Black roses, black roses
