(Intro)
You know I've heard a lot of remixes
To this song in particular
But this is not to be confused
I'm nothin' like the rest

She say I'm her errthang

Tell me what'chu want I'm on it
Pocket full of chedda
I swear I could spend whateva on it

(Drake & Trey Songz)
But she hold me down
Everytime I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it
'Til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

(Drake)
I say you-the-you-the best (Ayee)
You-the-you-the best (Ayee)
You-the-you-the best (Ayee)
You-the-you-the best (Ayee)
You the best I eva had

(Verse 1: Drake and Trey Songz)
(Drake)
Know you got a roomate
Call me when they no one there
Put the key under the mat
And you know I be ova there
(Trey Songz)
YUP! I be ova there
I can send a choffa there
Miss me in the bedroom
So she keep a poster there
Yea, from the kitchen to the sofa chair
Yea, we gettin' hotta than a toaster there
Yea, I beat it like an opponent
I'm a winner she begginna'
And I eat it like she want it
Only if she want it
Got my calendar know where I'm at
When I'm gone we alone on iChat
Send a picture to my phone
Cause when I'm looking at my lova, I don't wanna see anotha
Body on a milli-on
Like Christina Milion
I could be your dream (if you leave it's a nightmare)
If you leave I'll be right there
Waitin', I'm impatient
So you better make it right, Yea
It's Trigga Trey, girl you know the deal
If my flow cough, swallow candy paint, so forreal
I know where yo leevi be
Show me where them Levi's be
And I could make you overflow
'Foe you know the leevi broke
Oh, you know I ball like Spalding (spalding)
And all the broads be calling
Don't trip girl, cause I'm never fallin'
You I want to see when I wake up in the morning
Tell me what'chu need
I get anything you want and
Don't you disagree baby please
You know I want'chu
And I know you want me
Hate to pack yo bags, so I'm down in my knees
Never let you go
Cause you go too hard
Miss you like the quarterback throw too hard
Girl you hott enough to make the flow cool off
Get'chu wet enough you like a (?)
Mike Phelps swim through
I know what'chu in to
I'mma put you on when I ball like gym shoes
Walkin' through the mall and you all like "them too"
Throw it in the bag
Call me Dream, call me Fab
Louie V, who is he?
Ain't nobody true as me, truthfully
You the only one that's gon' be doin' me
Baby girl just you and me
Ain't gon' be no truency
Now won't you gimme brain like you came straight from school for me
I know, I know, I know...
That'chu pro'lly mad
I push my album back
Ohhhhhhuuuuuuuu
I know I've done it, time and time again
Well, I'm sorry baby(x2)
But if you would consida
To be a forgiva
Promise I'll deliva
First day of September, ohhh
I'm sorry baby(x2)

(Trey Songz speaking)
Just know there's a method to everything I do...
For my real fans
Uhh, Uhh
Cause ya'll the best I eva had
Best I eva had

YUP!
I'm sorry baby (x3)
