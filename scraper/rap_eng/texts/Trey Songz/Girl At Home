[Verse 1:]
You know I wanna stay but you know I gotta go (Girl I)
Really wanna sleep but you know I gotta leave (Girl I)
I'm scooping up my keys and I'm walking out the door (Girl I)
Hate it when you call my name cause you make me wanna change my mind

[Hook:]
You know I got a girl at home, home, home
Probably waiting by the phone, phone, phone
You know I gotta girl at home (All Alone)
And if I keep fucking round with you
She'll be gone

[Verse 2:]
I ain't trying to hurt your feelings (Naw)
But you just what it was before we started
And can't nobody ride like you do (No No nobody)
Don't nobody love me like she do
You look the other way when you see me in the street
I know it breaks your heart we ain't nothing but a secret
And that pussy so good you gotta a nigga straight cheating
Girl this ain't my bed and you know I can't sleep here

[Hook:]
You know I got a girl at home, home, home
Probably waiting by the phone, phone, phone
You know I gotta girl at home (All Alone)
And if I keep fucking round with you
She'll be gone

[Bridge:]
You know I gotta girl at home
And can't nobody take her place (No Baby)
And ain't nobody that loves me like she does
And I know I ain't been doing right
Even tho u got a fat ass and that thang so tight
I gotta a girl at home (ooooo)
And I know you gotta a nigga somewhere don't cha
And he probably somewhere mad tell him my bad I didn't mean to tap that ass (Well I did but)
You know what I saying (Why you looking at me like that stop)

[Hook:]
You know I got a girl at home, home, home
Probably waiting by the phone, phone, phone
You know I gotta girl at home (I need to take my ass on home)
And if I keep fucking round with you
She'll be gone
Bye, Bye, Bye, Bye
