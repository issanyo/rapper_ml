[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
There's never been a day that I
Felt the kind of way that I'm feeling now
I think my life done turned around
There's never been a girl that changed
Changed the way I looked at things
Oh, I...
I swear, I'm up and out the game in a minute

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Cause girl, I'm walking different, talking different
I'm thinking different, baby girl
My hustling, listen, touching, kissing
Hugging, missing, you got me loving and tripping
Cause girl, I'm walking different, talking different
I'm thinking different, baby girl
My hustling, listen, touching, kissing
Hugging, missing, you got me loving and tripping

[Verse 2: Brandon Hines]
Trey, I know what you saying, I think I met the same chick
Does she have a tattoo of a bunny rabbit on her hip?
Matter of fact, I think she told me 'bout this R&B nigga
I wasn't paying attention, she was fine, so I figured
I would pour some Hennessy, get her tipsy, where I want her
But little did I know, she had me right where she want me
Now I'm waking up, thinking I really put it down
She left me a note saying: "I'll see you around"

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Brandon Hines]
Cause girl, I'm walking different, talking different
I'm thinking different, baby girl
My hustling, listen, touching, kissing
Hugging, missing, you got me loving and tripping
Cause girl, I'm walking different, talking different
I'm thinking different, baby girl
My hustling, listen, touching, kissing
Hugging, missing, you got me loving and tripping

[Bridge: Brandon Hines]
How could I let myself get so caught up?
I know I got that work, I'm like what the f...?
She got me tripping, feeling I'm in love
All because the way she gave it up

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Brandon Hines]
Cause girl, I'm walking different, talking different
I'm thinking different, baby girl
My hustling, listen, touching, kissing
Hugging, missing, you got me loving and tripping
Cause girl, I'm walking different, talking different
I'm thinking different, baby girl
My hustling, listen, touching, kissing
Hugging, missing, you got me loving and tripping

[Outro: Brandon Hines, Trey Songz & Both]
