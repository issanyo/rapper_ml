[Intro: Fabolous & Trey Songz]
Trey
Yeah
Trappy New Years my niggas
Trappy New Year, baby
If you with a baddy right now, tell her turn around and let you see if it's all there, haha, yeah

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Who the lil baddie posted with the black on (I like it)
She could make a hustler leave 'fore the pack gone
Ass make you wanna get your from-the-back on
Pull up on her like she Ricky, get her back blown
She say I'm talkin' shit like I do in rap songs
I say you heard what I said like a tapped phone
I'm D'usse Wayne when I get my yak on
When you leave that joker hit me on the bat phone

[Hook: Trey Songz & Fabolous]
Ain't no disrespect, I need to check it's all there
Tell her turn it 'round and let me check it's all there
You know time is money, check my wrist, it's all there
Know the squad with me, if it's lit, we all there
Ain't no disrespect, I need to check it's all there
Tell her turn it 'round and let me check it's all there
You know time is money, check my wrist, it's all there
Know the squad with me, if it's lit, we all there

[Verse 2: Fabolous & Trey Songz]
Gotta pay respect, rest in peace to Bankroll
Let the bad bitches live, rest in peace to stank hoes
Cookin' up, I got the recipe for bankrolls
They tryna get the best of me, but they can't though
Carolina blue kicks, hottest nigga on the block
Used to wheelie bicycles, now the S6 go
Shorty ridin' with me, lookin' like I date Mia
Is it all there? Tell the truth, I hate liars

[Hook: Trey Songz & Fabolous]
Ain't no disrespect, I need to check it's all there
Tell her turn it 'round and let me check it's all there
You know time is money, check my wrist, it's all there
Know the squad with me, if it's lit, we all there
Ain't no disrespect, I need to check it's all there
Tell her turn it 'round and let me check it's all there
You know time is money, check my wrist, it's all there
Know the squad with me, if it's lit, we all there

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Panties drippin', rain drop drop top like a motherfuckin' Migos song
Pussy good, that pussy good, might put my amigos on
100 thou', this watch no diamonds, every time this shit's on time
Me and Loso, go so crazy, never so-so, no disk chasin'
Hol' up, bald nigga ball so hard like I'm jumpin' from the free throw line
She swallow, jaws been goin' so hard 'cause she love it when it's deep throat time
Yeah, 7 in the mornin' here but it's 10 on the East Coast time
She a 10 on the East, 10 on the West, 10 in the face, 10 in the breast

[Hook: Trey Songz & Fabolous]
Ain't no disrespect, I need to check it's all there
Tell her turn it 'round and let me check it's all there
You know time is money, check my wrist, it's all there
Know the squad with me, if it's lit, we all there
Ain't no disrespect, I need to check it's all there
Tell her turn it 'round and let me check it's all there
You know time is money, check my wrist, it's all there
Know the squad with me, if it's lit, we all there
