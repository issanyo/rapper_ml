[Intro]
Yo, you're here tonight
It's just me and you tonight and I got to know
And I'm at the point where, you and me tonight
I don't never wanna share you ever again and I got to know, yeah
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it, do it, aye aye aye aye aye
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, do it, aye aye aye aye aye

[Verse 1]
When you first showed me the kitten, girl you knew I was a freak, damn right
You knew ya swag was gon' do something to me
You keep telling me one day you his, then one day you want me
Won't you stop all the pretending, what the business gon' be?
I've been promising you something more than just a couple weeks
Been rolling round and jumping in and out bed, in and outta bed
A real decision's what I need and girl it's time for you to make it
And while ya taking it, look at me girl and tell me one thing

[Chorus]
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it, do it, aye aye aye aye aye
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, do it, aye aye aye aye aye
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it
When I do it, I bet you he don't make you come like I do
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it, aye aye aye aye aye
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it
When I do it, I bet you he don't make you come like I do
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, do it
You're here tonight and I got to know
You and me tonight and I got to know

[Verse 2]
When you be home, do you sometimes get so
Frustrated 'cause he wanna stay too long?
I'm missing you calling on the bat phone
Tryna see what tonight gon' hear for
When you with him do, sometimes kinda wish that it was us
Posted up in the kitchen, you teaching me how to cook
Then it pop off on the counter and we make a lot of fuss
Then I take over the teaching and you know what I'll do first

[Chorus]
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it, do it, aye aye aye aye aye
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, do it, aye aye aye aye aye
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it
When I do it, I bet you he don't make you come like I do
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it, aye aye aye aye aye
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it
When I do it, I bet you he don't make you come like I do
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, do it

[Bridge]
Tell me do you like it, do like the way I pull your hair? Aye aye aye aye aye
Tell me do you like it, do like the way I go down there? Aye aye aye aye aye
Tell me do you like it how I make you yell and scream out, yeah? Aye aye aye aye aye
Tell me don't you like how I do it when you can't catch your breath breath breath breath? Aye aye aye aye aye
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it, does he play with your hair?
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it, do it, does he love you there?
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, does he spank you from the back?
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, do it, does he do it like that? Oh

[Chorus]
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it
When I do it, I bet you he don't make you come like I do
Does he do it, does he do it, does he do it, aye aye aye aye aye
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it
When I do it, I bet you he don't make you come like I do
Like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, like I do it, do it
