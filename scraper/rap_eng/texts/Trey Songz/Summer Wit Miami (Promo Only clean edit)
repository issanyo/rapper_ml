[Jim Jones Talking]
See rap music is subliminal
But the music for us is like our own diary
Something like a confession
They tell me 'life is a bitch'
She's something like the seasons, just like mother nature
She comes and goes as she please
That's why they get their period once a month
I say that to say this
If you think that bitch
Summer is yours
She could be cheating on you
Ya heard

[Verse 1 (Jim Jones)]
Got me feeling like opium
I'm tryna dance with the loaded M
Open a bottle and it goes around
I'm leaving drunk by 4 am
And watch me jump in a dolce benz
Top down with the pokey rims
And now i'm swerving so you know i'm bent
I lost count so who knows what I spent
I recall nine {?}
Bitches stepping on my nice sneakers with
One hand in the sky and the other hand was on her
Thigh
I was grinding to the beat with my hammer on my side
Now the g's only as we speed to the rolex
And three or four g's is what we sneeze on the rolex
Playing some cards it's about 6 am
You think the is over but if just begin
They say clubs pacing like bad boys 2
You can see the snow bunnies doing what bad girls do
That's esctasy weed that had girl to
Scoop the bitch that had ki's selling fast off blue
Now i'm speeding to the telly got the porshe behind
Trying to get in her belly the only thought on my mind
Like damn; not trying to be pushy or nothing but
Since the strip joint girl I should have been fucking

[Chorus (Trey Songz)]
Spending the summer with the top dropped low
Throwing my hundreds at the top notch hoes
Smoking on the top notch dro...
That's a summer with Miami
Bottle in the air
I'm living without a care
Shorty beside me
The wind blowing threw her hair
That's a summer with Miami

[Verse 2 (Jim Jones)]
I can't keep it low anymore
I'll be with my girl when it starts snow and get bored
When you love three women
It's hard to keep up with the lies
You see spring my first love I started creeping with
July
Used to say I had some shows
Catch a plane to M-I then
I started tricking dough and bought a range for july
But i said I'm love sick over this hot ass hoochie and
I seen her when I told Nas I slapped her with coffy
We don't play disrespect but that was the day we met
Summer jam o-2 I hit the stage with my set but her man
Was from brooklyn she still slipped me the number
She said he's on vacation she get with me this summer
Then i been flirting over the past two years now she
Hates seeing me in the winter
Ain't gonna last through the years
Now i'm looking at winter like life's an adventure
And then when june comes i'll be gone till september
Now would you hate me for that
I know your heart's cold could you wait till i'm back
I'm just a sucker for love
But a nigga hold me down if you wanna fuck with a thug

[Chorus (2x)]
Spending the summer with the top dropped low
Throwing my hundreds at the top notch hoes
Smoking on the top notch dro
That's a summer wit Miami
Bottle in the air
I'm living without a care
Shorty beside me
The wind blowing threw her hair
That's a summer with Miami
