[Verse 1]
You probably could have make it work in the past life
Said vows, I make you the first and last wife
A rich Nigga thats certain to hit the ass right
Make a broke bitch smile like a low gas price
Truthfully I was digging your little style
Kept your hills on, I'm hitting you all wild
Poker chips and Vegas dinners,...
We trying Minaj later, so you pick a girl out
I look at you and see a different girl, now
Getting Whitley with me, a different world now
A good girl, then I turn you into a bad bitch
Constipated ass you ain't never had shit
I'm so over your head, you shoulda caught that
Fucking with my phones
When I'm gone, like you bought that
I was fucking with you heavy, but I'm bachelor
Money is my only girl, no lie, relaxer

[Chorus]
Can't fuck with you no more
I just can't fuck, just can't fuck with you no more
Fucking with you is bad for my health!
Fuck with you no more
I just can't fuck, just can't fuck with you no more
Fucking with you is bad for my health
Fucking with you is bad for my health!

[Verse 2]
Crazy with the head, but she crazy in head
Attract a lot of birds cause I make a lot of bread
Searching for my dove, hoping love is forgiven
And I find that a dove ain't nothing but a pigeon
Y'all know, I ain't nothing but a player
Guess is value that make them wanna value
Can't blame you for wanting something major
Shout out to the broads, like can I get a Laker?
Really women don't you be embarrassed by the fakers
Yves Saint Laurent is probably flattered by the bakers
Moments couldn't flatter being madder at the haters
How dare you dislike me when I know I am the greatest
But now I see the beauty when they try to subdue me
All on my balls see the blogs is the groupies
But that's the part of my movie
Deep down I know you are happy you ever knew me

[Chorus]
