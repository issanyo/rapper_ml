Tryna be real baby just to let you know
Fuck you on the counter and move you to the floor
Have you going all night baby, 3 times in a row
Hitting that back to back, 3 times in a row
3 times in a row, 3 times in a row
3 times in a row, 3 times in a row
3 times in a row, 3 times in a row
3 times in a row, let me hold that beat (I like it)

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I'm the pussy killer, everybody know that
If you got a girl, better get a LoJack
She don't like to smoke but I let her roll that
Mr. I-ain't-never-got-her, holla where the hoes at
Say she wanna fuck, yeah, just to let me know
So I hit her up, put her on the schedule
Then I eat her up like a nigga Hannibal
And I got the whole thing on the camera roll

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
Ooh, the first time, we won't make it to the bed
Yeah the second time, you be so weak in your legs
By the third round, you know I invented sex
Three times in a row, I bet I leave that pussy
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
3 times in a row with me, I made that pussy RIP

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Put that pussy straight to sleep, wake it up, put it right back
Tell me where the girls that done had it like that
Tell me where the girls that imagine like that
Got 'em feeling on your titties while I'm dicking from the back
When we switching up positions, got it dripping down your ass crack
Just the second round, you already having flashbacks
Nasty nigga, fucking with your boy yeah
Your ass get bigger, hit 'em with the shit now

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
Ooh, the first time, we won't make it to the bed
Yeah the second time, you be so weak in your legs
By the third round, you know I invented sex
Three times in a row, I bet I leave that pussy
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
Leave that pussy dead, leave that pussy dead
3 times in a row with me, I made that pussy RIP
