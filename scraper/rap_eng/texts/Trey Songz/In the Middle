[Intro]
Um, no
If I could be up in the middle of
Just wanna be in the middle of
Middle of your love

[Verse 1]
If I could be, anywhere in the world, I would be
Inside your skirt, in you girl, between your knees
Everyday of my life, my life, my life
I just want, to make your body really want to get it on
We can turn the bed into a stage and then perform
Your body's getting hot girl, I could feel it's warm
I show you what I'll do

[Chorus]
If I could be up in the middle of, middle of your love
Giving you a little uh, like a cup, I'll fill ya up
Just wanna be in the middle of, the middle of your love
Your love, love, love, love
If I could be up in the middle of, middle of your love
Giving you a little uh, like a cup, I'll fill ya up
Just wanna be in the middle of, the middle of your love
Your love, love, love, love

[Verse 2]
If I could be, believe me girl I would be your fantasy
I'll make you come right were you'll be on top of me
So can we get that close, where I can feel l your body sweat
Tryna make yo body wet
Can we, climb the mountain top screaming ecstasy
We so high up in this love, we done reach the peak
We ain't never coming down, baby keep making that sound
If I could just be

[Chorus]
If I could be up in the middle of, middle of your love
Giving you a little uh, like a cup, I'll fill ya up
Just wanna be in the middle of, the middle of your love
Your love, love, love, love
If I could be up in the middle of, middle of your love
Giving you a little uh, like a cup, I'll fill ya up
Just wanna be in the middle of, the middle of your love
Your love, love, love, love

[Bridge]
It's got me open, willing and ready
Baby, I'm open, listen up and hear me
I'm not tryna be in the front or the back, by the side
Just inside, deep inside, the middle of your love
Ooh, oh, whoa
Uh, let me in, let me in the middle

[Chorus]
If I could be up in the middle of, middle of your love
Giving you a little uh, like a cup, I'll fill ya up
Just wanna be in the middle of, the middle of your love
Your love, love, love, love
If I could be up in the middle of, middle of your love
Giving you a little uh, like a cup, I'll fill ya up
Just wanna be in the middle of, the middle of your love
Your love, love, love, love
