[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Shorty, all I got is a dollar and a dream, is ya gonna roll with me?
You see I've tried a 9 to 5, and it just don't fit me)
I can get us out the hood and have us living good, you feel me?
But I ain't leaving here if you ain't with me
'Cause, girl, a suit with a smile that don't fit me
Taking a bus for some miles is gon' kill me, oh no
I'm tryna turn it around, start this thing from the ground
Well as long as you're down I know

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Looking at you day after day, I know I
Just gotta make it (alright), just gotta make it, Just gotta make it
Just to see that smile up on your face, I know I

Everything I do, I do for you and we
Just gotta make it (alright), we just gotta make it
To the top of the world, me and my girl we
Just gotta make it (alright), just gotta make it

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Now, baby
One day soon, you gon' walk outside and see a Mercedes
And I'm gon' give ya the keys and tell ya go shopping
And buy e'rything you want,buy e'rything you need, make sure you get shit for me
Then I can get us out the hood and have us living good
But first I gotta know, if you gonna roll
'Cause a suit with a smile, don't fit me
Taking a bus for some miles is gon' kill me
I'm tryna turn it around, start this thing from the ground
As long as I know you gonna be there

[Verse 3: Twista]
Even if I gotta go and cop a thang
Get up early and go standin' on the block, some how I
Just gotta make it, that's right
Just gotta make it, uh-huh
Even if I have to sit with the fellas
At the round table and come up on a plot, some how I
Just gotta make it, baby girl I
Just gotta make it, uh-huh
I'm tellin' you the truth on the daily
There's nothin' I won't do for you baby
Havin' big dreams of me ridin' in the Bentley Continental
While me copin' you a cute lil' Mercedes
And I know I got the block hot
But until I make it happen for you baby I will not stop
I'ma drape you with diamonds and furs
Visions of your herb blowin' in the wind from a drop top
Like a baller, like a true shot caller
The homie, Trey Songz, tippin' all day long if he have to
Makin' that money for the family
Can I get up witcha it's that nigga named Twista
Come and take a lil' cruise with a G through the Chi-town streets
'Cause you feelin' me under inspiration whenever I'm

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Looking at you day after day, I know I
Just gotta make it (alright), just gotta make it, Just gotta make it
Just to see that smile up on your face, I know I

[Outro: Twista]
Oh yeah, t's Trey Songz, and the homie Twista
Oh, we gon' have to make it, y'all
For my baby, 'cause we entrepreneurs
