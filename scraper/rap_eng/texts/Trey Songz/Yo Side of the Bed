[Intro]
She's gone again
She's gone again, no no

[Verse 1]
Every time she leaves, it's my heart that she taking from me, oh
And I don't know if she's gone for good or returning in the morning, oh
And I wait through the night 'cause I can't help the tossing and turning
I want you to know that our bed, our sheets, our pillows getting lonely, on

[Chorus]
Yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side
It's lonely on yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side
It's not the same without you here on yo side of the bed
All night I hold your pillow
It's lonely on yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side
It's so lonely there
And I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here, no

[Verse 2]
I just wanna breathe your air, watch you when you wrapping up your hair
Gazing at the mirrors up there, I'm reaching while imagining that you're there
I wait through the night girl, tossing and turning and tossing and turning, oh
Our bed, our sheets, our pillows getting lonely on

[Chorus]
Yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side
It's lonely on yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side
It's not the same without you here on yo side of the bed
All night I hold your pillow
It's lonely on yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side
It's so lonely there
And I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here

[Bridge]
Play on, that's what you gotta do sometimes
Let it play baby
Uh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
So lonely there

[Chorus]
On yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side, yo side
It's so lonely baby, on yo side of the bed
Yo side, yo side, yo side
When you come home, girl, you should know your pillow's waiting girl
On yo side of the bed
On yo side
'Cause this bed ain't the same without the love that we made
And the sound of the springs, no
And I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here

[Outro]
Sleep, she's coming back
Sleep, she's coming back
