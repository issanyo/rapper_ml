Hard to take it easy cause she like it so rough
And she tryna be tough (she still she still yeah)
Morning to the evening and she can't get enough
No she can't get enough (she still she still woo)

Daydreams of your kisses and
Nightmares you went missing, girl
Caught up in your world, Wanna live up in you girl
Yeah you got me tripping, Ohh you got me wishing
I was working when I'm working I fill out every position
When you're gone I miss you, yes I do
So don't you make me suffer, you pretty motherfucker
No oh no no no no no no
My arms here to hold you, to console you
Wanna feel your body close to mine
So you can let your body be free with me

Hard to take it easy cause she like it so rough
And she tryna be tough but she still scratchin' me up
Morning to the evening and she can't get enough
No she can't get enough cause she still scratchin' me up
Kissing on my neck slowly turn to biting cause she like it so rough and she still scratchin' me up
Digging in my skin from beginning to end and I'm tryna be tough cause she still scratchin' me up

The sheets, the pillows, the dresser, the covers, the mattress
The passion, the pain, the pleasure, whatever
Going girl, I'm going, you just keep that river flowing
Turn this bed into an ocean, wanna swim up in you girl
(And don't you try to run) Girl don't you try
(Girl we just begun) Girl we just begun
So don't you make me suffer, you pretty motherfucker
Got me going through withdrawals, girl I really need to touch you
My arms here to hold you, to console you
Wanna feel your body close to mine
So you can let your love be free with me

Hard to take it easy cause she like it so rough
And she tryna be tough but she still scratchin' me up
Morning to the evening and she can't get enough
No she can't get enough cause she still scratchin' me up
Kissing on my neck slowly turn to biting cause she like it so rough and she still scratching me up
Digging in my skin from beginning to end and I'm tryna be tough cause she still scratchin' me up

The stars are now aligned, your body needs mine
The fact remains the same, I'll take your pain if you take miiiii-iiiiiiiiine
My arms here to hold you, to console you
Wanna feel your body close to mine so you can let your love be free with me, with me

Hard to take it easy cause she like it so rough
And she tryna be tough but she still scratchin' me up
Morning to the evening and she can't get enough
No she can't get enough cause she still scratchin' me up
Kissing on my neck slowly turn to biting cause she like it so rough and she still scratching me up
Digging in my skin from beginning to end and I'm tryna be tough cause she still scratchin' me upp

It's Anticipation II and the freaky things you do
They started Anticipation I and she ain't done (still scratchin' me up)
Digging in my skin from beginning to the end
And I'm tryna be tough, cause she still scratchin' me up
