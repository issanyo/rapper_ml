[Verse 1]
I don't wanna do too much
I don't wanna speak too much
I don't wanna breathe the wrong way
I don't wanna kill this moment
This moment shared between us
'Cause I been thinking 'bout it all day, oh woah

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me I'm all you wanted
And I don't wanna ruin your expectations
And all your body language, I'm gon' read it, ayy
As best as I can (as best as I can) 'cause tonight I am

[Chorus]
Having sex with my number one fan
So why am I so nervous?
So why am I so nervous?
Having sex with my number one fan
So why am I so nervous?
Having sex with my number one fan
So why am I so nervous?

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna move too fast
Girl, I wanna make it last
Tonight we gonna do it my way, ooh
I know you been waiting for it
You gotta just lay back
I just wanna take my time, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me I'm all you wanted
And I don't wanna ruin your expectations, oh no no no no
Your body language, I'm gon' read it
As best as I can (as best as I can) 'cause tonight I am

[Chorus]
Having sex with my number one fan
So why am I so nervous?
So why am I so nervous?
Having sex with my number one fan
So why am I so nervous?
Having sex with my number one fan
So why am I so nervous?

[Bridge]
You ready?
Will I live up to the man she sees?
Will I give her everything she needs?
I just hope that when we're done she's pleased
I hope it's everything you thought it'd be, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me I'm all you wanted
And I don't wanna ruin your expectations, oh no no no no
And all your body language, I'm gon' read it (all night long)
As best as I can (as best as I can) 'cause tonight I am

[Chorus]
Having sex with my number one fan (so why am I)
So why am I so nervous? (nervous, baby)
So why am I so nervous?
Having sex with my number one fan (I just wanna get it right for you, baby)
So why am I so nervous?
Having sex with my number one fan (I just wanna get it right for you, baby)
So why am I so nervous?
