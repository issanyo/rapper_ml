[Chorus]
Serve it up, serve it up, girl, your loving is the bestest
Working up an appetite and baby you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll do your dirty dishes
Serve it up, serve it up, I'm coming back for seconds
Working up an appetite and baby, you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll never leave the kitchen

[Verse 1]
Girl, girl, don't you keep me waiting
Say you got a situation, but you here now
Oh girl, baby girl, I know you're down
So let me get you out this crowd and we'll get working

[Pre-Chorus]
Go to work on you
'Cause you know I want it, you won't be disappointed
I'm a fool
I just wanna get a little taste, put it right on my plate and serve it up

[Chorus]
Serve it up, serve it up, girl, your loving is the bestest
Working up an appetite and baby you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll do your dirty dishes
Serve it up, serve it up, I'm coming back for seconds
Working up an appetite and baby, you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll never leave the kitchen

[Verse 2]
Girl, girl, I know that you know that it's only a matter of time
'Til I do what I do and I make you mine
Girl, got me kissing all on your spot, going hard like your body was my job
Tick, tick, tock, like I'm punching on the clock

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll work on you
'Cause you know I want it, you won't be disappointed
I'm a fool
I just wanna get a little taste, put it right on my face and serve it up

[Chorus]
Serve it up, serve it up, girl, your loving is the bestest
Working up an appetite and baby you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll do your dirty dishes
Serve it up, serve it up, I'm coming back for seconds
Working up an appetite and baby, you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll never leave the kitchen

[Bridge]
You got that body, you got that body, wanna please it
You got that body, you got that body, and I need it
Girl, I've been waiting all damn day
Come on and put it on my plate

[Chorus]
Serve it up, serve it up, girl, your loving is the bestest
Working up an appetite and baby you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll do your dirty dishes
Serve it up, serve it up, I'm coming back for seconds
Working up an appetite and baby, you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll never leave the kitchen
