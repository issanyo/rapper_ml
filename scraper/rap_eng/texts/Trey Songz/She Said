She said all she needed was some sexual healing
She said that's when she called me
She said she never catch no feelings
She said she just looking for a one night stand
She said she know the different between lovers and friends
That's what she said, that's what she said

[Verse 1: Foxx]
I remember like yesterday
You was with your dude, I was with my old lady
You slid me your number, told me you would never play me
You said you didn't love him, you was with him 'cause the baby
We got away on weekends and everythin' was gravy
But then you got to blowin' up my cellphone daily
You know I got a woman, I can't answer when she round me
You can't be number two, you should have left me where you found me
You said you understood this was only for the pleasure
We used to sneak and meet, now you tryna meet whenever
I'm happy where I'm at so we can't take it to that level
I told you when I met you, we would never be together
It used to be a secret, now my business in the street
You told her, she told him and he told me
Remember what you said, 'fore we made this decision
You told me I was dick on the side, now you reniggin', that's what you said

She said all she needed was some sexual healing
She said that's when she called me
She said she never catch no feelings
She said she just want a plan B
She said she just looking for a one night stand
She said she know the different between lovers and friends
That's what she said, that's what she said, that's what she said

[Verse 2: Foxx]
It went from a one night stand about a year
And now you askin' to make my girl dissappear
It ain't gon' happen, not for you, so you can kill the noise
And if you feel you want to tell her, I will take my charge
But if you tell my old lady, I'ma tell your boy
And you will never see me again, I swear to God
It wasn't supposed to be like this, you done caught feelings
And all that be together talk, I am not hearin' it
You leavin' voicemail message on MySpace
Invadin' my space, you all in my face
Passin' by my place, buildin' a fake case
You get behind my truck, people think we playin' chase
Sometimes I wish I never met ya, wish I never saw you
The day you gave me your number, I wish I never called ya
Remember what you said, 'fore we made this decision
You told me I was dick on the side, now you reniggin'

[Verse 3: Foxx]
See now my girl gettin' suspicious
You make this shit too obvious, she know I got a mistress
See you a bad decision, got me in a bad position
Fussin' with you all in public, got me losin' my religion
I bought you what ask for and took you where you never go
Showed you shit you never saw and fucked you like a real pro
All I ever asked was you to keep this shit  here on the low
But you gon' get your heart involved, now you not gon' let it go
You told me you was grown and you wasn't fallin' for no dick
And I better call you 'cause you wasn't callin' for no dick
Told me I was plan B, but now you stalkin' me and shit
You ain't actin' like nobody mama, girl, you unfit
I never disrespect you, never call you a bitch
Never put my hands on you but I will tell you this
Remember what you told me before we made this decision
You told me I was dick on the side, now you reniggin', that's what you said
