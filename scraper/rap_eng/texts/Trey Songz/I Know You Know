[Intro: Trey Songz]
Put ya feet up in my shoes for a minute
Shawty, peep the way I do, how I'm livin'
You steadily trippin', say I'm trickin' with the women
Girl, don't make me get to trippin', everything is what I'm givin', I know

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
I know I'm comin' home to big fine after my day done
All concerned about how I'm feelin' and if I ate somethin'
You always hear the bullshit stories and never say nothin'
'Cause all of 'em in search for a man, that's why they stay sufferin'
Though you may think I'm from this bitch to the next
A nigga be outchea tryna get him a check, but I prefer cash
For me and you so don't even much get ya nerves bad
They want attention and they don't even deserve that
Girl, you miss Juv-E, what you think I don't care?
What you think I'm 'bout to go sacrifice this shit for that there?
They wanna catch the biggest fish in the sea, but he ain't swimmin'
'Cause he satisfied and ain't lookin' forward to other women

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I know, you know, I know, you know
Just 'cause they shakin', don't mean I'm takin'
I know, you know, you know, yeah
Just 'cause they holla, don't mean I follow
I know, you know, you know, baby
Just 'cause they throw it, don't mean I'm catchin'
I know, you know, you know
No matter how long I'm gone, I'm always comin' home to you

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
You gotta believe me, you don't have to police me
I be up in the streets makin' sure that me and you eat see
Women try to tease me but I tell 'em be easy
My family needs me so I'm goin' where my seeds be
I can sign ya poster but I cannot intercourse ya
They really wanna solider,, that's why the bendin' it over
Holla at big daddy, I'm comin' home like I 'ppose ta
With a big ole bag of groceries and somethin' that we can smoke up
We don't need a passion 'cause me and you is what's happenin'
They thought we wasn't adaptin', now everybody congratin'
Forget all of that yappin' as long as we keep interactin'
And we keep on attractin' to each other with a passion

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I know, you know, I know, you know
Just 'cause they shakin', don't mean I'm takin'
I know, you know, you know, yeah
Just 'cause they holla, don't mean I follow
I know, you know, you know, baby
Just 'cause they throw it, don't mean I'm catchin'
I know, you know, you know
No matter how long I'm gone, I'm always comin' home to you

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
When the big dog is in ya they gon' wanna bother a G
Wanna leave way at night and come back tomorrow with me
Yup so they can put a nigga business all in the streets
Out here tellin' folks she gotta problem recordin' for keeps
She got big Randy Johnson, tryna get me to the plate
Hopin' I reconize her curve but I can't even relate
Now they be at the red light, flashin' me with they head lights
I know how to play it like, tell 'em to get they head right
I'm not tryna touch her so you can keep ya lil rubber
You too young for me why ya tryna get me in trouble
She know that I love her, look we was meant for each other
And she gon' act a fool when she with me under the cover

[Hook: Trey Songz]
