Zaytoven, Zaytoven, Zaytoven, Zaytoven, Zaytoven

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
Attitude all mad when you talk
Let me look at that ass when you walk away
All that shit talkin' too often
Just shut the fuck up, take it off then
I know just how you act when you want it
I know just how you act when you horny
I'ma let you yell
I'ma let you shout
When I lay you down, I never let you down, no

[Chorus]
Never leave-never leave-never leave you disappointed
Never leave-never leave-never leave you disappointed
Gon' learn how to watch your mouth
Learn how to watch your mouth
Learn how to watch your mouth
Learn how to watch your mouth

[Verse]
Girl, who the hell is you talkin' to? Must be out'cho mind
Say what you want and I got it, you get in no time
Never met a nigga more true, that's no lie
I adore you, I spoil you, you so fine
Who you tryna disrespect like that?
Why you think that you could play like that?
Turn that ass 'round, stay like that
Don't you go nowhere
You want that, oh yeah
You want that, oh-oh
Go fast, go slow
Tempo controlla

[Bridge]
Girl, your eyes pickin' fights
Think you fly every time
I know sex is on your mind
I know sex on your mind
Tried to flex on me, why?
Want your legs in the sky
Like a pretzel tonight
Twist her up, Do or Die
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Attitude all mad when you talk
Let me look at that ass when you walk away
All that shit talkin' too often
Just shut the fuck up, take it off then
I know just how you act when you want it
I know just how you act when you horny
I'ma let you yell
I'ma let you shout
When I lay you down, I never let you down, no

[Chorus]
Never leave-never leave-never leave you disappointed
Never leave-never leave-never leave you disappointed
Gon' learn how to watch your mouth
Learn how to watch your mouth
Learn how to watch your mouth
Learn how to watch your mouth
