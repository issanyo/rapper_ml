[Intro: Jus Bleezy & Trey Songz]
Yo, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
This for the grown and sexy
You ain't never been with a cat like me
You ain't never been with a cat like me
Ain't no way, no way, no way

[Verse 1: Jus Bleezy]
Hey girl, let me tell you I'd do anythin' that's made
To put your body in motion
How you flow like a cell if you pop champagne
Got enough peach bottles to make the kitty cat sing
Girl, you know I do my thing, real G, no lames
Say you like to spend change, baby, money ain't a thing
Come here, hop inside my Benz, floss in from of your friends
Now your work is done, it's the weekend
Now it's time to play with the grown folks way
No panties involved, now a problem solved
Got 10 inches on my dick to kick the party right off
'Bout to dip into your sauce, screamin', "Oh my God"

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You ain't never been with a cat like me
Baby, paper ain't a thing, I make a hater complain
Pop a couple bottles, throw stacks like me
I be switchin' up the lanes, make paper in a day
Two 4's on the 'lac like me
You ain't never been with a cat like me
Ain't no way, no way, no way

[Verse 2: Jus Bleezy]
It's verse 2, baby, lemme show you what it do
When you fuckin' with a true who loves to break rules
You got a man, that's cool, I got a spot out west
With a maid and a chef, I love lovin' to death
You got a real nice smile, sit back, talk a while
Got me turnin' off my phone, girl, I'm all in your zone
I be careful where we go, nobody has to know
Can we take it slow? Stand behind closed doors
Keep it gangsta, mackin' when we step, break your back
Yo, the party just begun, yeah it's 2 AM
And the city don't sleep when the night's callin' me
I got a check for 23, baby, I'm spendin' money

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You ain't never been with a cat like me
Baby, paper ain't a thing, I make a hater complain
Pop a couple bottles, throw stacks like me
I be switchin' up the lanes, make paper in a day
Two 4's on the 'lac like me
You ain't never been with a cat like me
Ain't no way, no way, no way

[Verse 3: Jus Bleezy]
I'm likin' them white girl, brown gets me down
Got a real mami cita who really loves to greet me with a smile and a kiss
Eyes on Chinese with a thick ass booty and some fine ass titties
And her hair so straight, they say that is so great
I'm on a date with this chick I can't even speak the language
She ordered steak with the lobster with a pasta please
Man, I scored in the movies, had this chick on her knees
Can't stop the feelin' once the wheels start spinnin'
Let me take you to a place where they sell them on they own
STL or the street live runnin'
Baby, we gettin' money, spend it for me please

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You ain't never been with a cat like me
Baby, paper ain't a thing, I make a hater complain
Pop a couple bottles, throw stacks like me
I be switchin' up the lanes, make paper in a day
Two 4's on the 'lac like me
You ain't never been with a cat like me
Ain't no way, no way, no way
You ain't never been with a cat like me
Baby, paper ain't a thing, I make a hater complain
Pop a couple bottles, throw stacks like me
I be switchin' up the lanes, make paper in a day
Two 4's on the 'lac like me
You ain't never been with a cat like me
Ain't no way, no way, no way
