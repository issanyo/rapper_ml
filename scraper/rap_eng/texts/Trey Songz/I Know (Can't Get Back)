[Intro]
I know, I know, I know

[Verse 1]
I never had time for you
Spending my nights, caught in that life
The hell am I supposed to do
When everything wrong, feels so right?
I, been losing the fight with my ego
Girl to the right won’t let me go
Making it hard on a nigga
To look away and turn it down

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been drinking way too much to be thinking about love
To be thinking about us, so I'ma pour another cup
And I can’t leave this club alone, so it ain't about trust
I got a reputation, good or bad, so what, I gotta keep it up

[Chorus]
I've been living my life in these clubs
I've been giving my life to these girls
The bright lights like drugs
The fast life don’t slow up
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I get it
I know, I know, I know I know
I know, yeah, I know, yeah
I've been living my life in these clubs
I've been giving my life to these girls
The  bright lights like drugs
The fast life don’t slow up
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I get it
I know, I know, I know I know
I know, yeah, I know, yeah
There’s some things I can’t get back, yeah
It’s some things I can’t get back, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back

[Verse 2]
If you’re looking for love, you won’t find it here
I’ve had my share of that life
But I never have time to give
'Cause I always spread myself thin
I'm losing the fight with my ego
It’s like you won’t let me go
And you’re making it hard on a nigga
To look away and turn it down

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been drinking way too much to be thinking about love
To be thinking about us, so I'ma pour another cup
And I can’t leave this club alone, so it ain't about trust
I got a reputation, good or bad, so what, I gotta keep it up

[Chorus]
I've been living my life in these clubs
I've been giving my life to these girls
The bright lights like drugs
The fast life don’t slow up
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I get it
I know, I know, I know I know
I know, yeah, I know, yeah
I've been living my life in these clubs
I've been giving my life to these girls
The  bright lights like drugs
The fast life don’t slow up
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I get it
I know, I know, I know I know
I know, yeah, I know, yeah
There’s some things I can’t get back, yeah
It’s some things I can’t get back, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back
There’s some things I can’t get back, yeah
It’s some things I can’t get back, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back
