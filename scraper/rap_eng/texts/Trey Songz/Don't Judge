[Intro]
Yeah
I got a question for you baby

[Verse 1]
Would you think a nigga rude
If I said I wanna fuck?
Right now (Whatchu sayin)
Beautiful, don’t you be a prude
You know what you came to do
Gon lay it down
Got my J’ rolled tight, and with a light
Think I left it on the table (Hey pass me that lighter, girl)
You say you like a little white, that’s alright
You can sniff off my navel (No—that’s all you, I’m good)
Let your body bust (Let your body bust)
The room spinning around (The room spinning around)
Show a nigga love
Give me some head now, for real

[Hook]
Baby I would never judge
This is something you can trust
And you know when left the club
We both wanted to fuck so
Won’t you do it like you was my girlfriend (like you was my girlfriend)
Like we going til the world end (going til the world end)
Both so high and (Both so high and)
Only for tonight can
You fuck me like you was my girlfriend

[Bridge]
Say you never done it even though I don’t believe you
I would never judge you, no
Cause’ I don’t judge, nah

[Verse 2]
Don’t the skylight shine so bright from the city coming in through the balcony
Pretty pretty skin on your back glistening
While you put your mouth on me
I won’t tell nobody nothing bout you and me
Promise that you’ll do the same (For real)
You know how this shit be, for real

[Hook]
Baby I would never judge (I won’t judge you)
This is something you can trust (Can I trust you?)
And you know when left the club (Ay, tell the truth girl)
We both wanted to fuck so
Won’t you do it like you was my girlfriend (like you was my girlfriend)
Like we going til the world end (going til the world end)
Both so high and (Both so high and)
Only for tonight can (Only for tonight)
You fuck me like you was my girlfriend

[Bridge]
Say you never done it even though I don’t believe you
I would never judge you, no
Cause’ I don’t judge

[Outro]
Pretty pretty skin on your back glistening
While you put your mouth on me

Gon do it girl, gon do it girl
Gon do it girl, gon do it girl
Gon do it girl, gon do it girl
Gon do it girl, gon do it girl

Gon do it, gon do it
Gon oo it, oo it
Do it, oo it
Feel so da
Feel so… feel so
Dam… dam

Oh—that shit is crazy
Ohh, you got it ba—by
