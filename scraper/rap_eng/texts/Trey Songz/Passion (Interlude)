[Intro]
Baby, I'm so sorry I'm late
It's been such a long day
I went to go get my nails done, I went shopping
And I'm in love with these shoes
I can't want for you to see me in them on (You're welcome)
I'm so happy to see you *muah* (You are, you are, you are, you're welcome)
How was your day?
Come in, relax
Let your hair down, please
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me

[Verse]
Ooh, you're so fine, so happy, you're mine, my girl
Your presence is a gift and I don't wanna waste no time
So tell me what you need and I got it
Material, is it physical, sexual, intellectual? Let me know
Girl, I've been waiting all day and all night
For you to come and get right, in my life
You play a special part
And I'm giving you all my heart
Are you giving me yours, I'm asking?
The liquor got me giving you the passion
Say that you'll forever be my baby
The liquor got me feeling so crazy
I never wanna think about the next girl
'Cause you made me forget about my ex-girl
