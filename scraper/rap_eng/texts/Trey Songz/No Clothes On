[Intro]
No clothes on
We back, hey
Songz and the Runners
No clothes on
This Songbook baby

[Chorus]
I can picture you with no clothes on
Girl I gotta have it, I'm attracted
The way you dancing, looking back at it
No clothes on
Everybody leaning, I wouldn't mind seeing
You snapping out them jeans like you got
No clothes on

[Verse 1]
And I'm so gone, up in my zone
Baby with the business, you so grown
Baby, oh my goodness, is this my imagination?
And I hallucinating?
Girl, you so tone
And I just wanna beep it
Let me see your Secret
Wanna whisper in your ear, come here

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me work that thang, let me twerk that thang
Let me work that thang, let me twerk that thang, girl I might hurt that thang
Shawty what your name is? Ooh girl, I gotta know
And shawty who you came with? Don't take this personal but

[Chorus]
I can picture you with no clothes on
Girl I gotta have it, I'm attracted
The way you dancing, looking back at it
No clothes on
Everybody leaning, I wouldn't mind seeing
You snapping out them jeans like you got
No clothes on

[Verse 2]
Ain't no more 'trone, if this your song
Won't you gone over there and do that thang
Don't be 'shamed by that booty, body, do it shawty, you been naughty
Pimping, attending the after party
What's so wrong?
I just wanna make this clear, can I whisper in your ear?

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me work that thang, let me twerk that thang
Let me work that thang, let me twerk that thang, girl I might hurt that thang
Shawty what your name is? Ooh girl, I gotta know
And shawty who you came with? Don't take this personal

[Chorus]
But I can picture you with no clothes on
Girl I gotta have it, I'm attracted
The way you dancing, looking back at it
No clothes on
Everybody leaning, I wouldn't mind seeing
You snapping out them jeans like you got
No clothes on
I can picture you with no clothes on
Girl I gotta have it, I'm attracted
The way you dancing, looking back at it
No clothes on
Everybody leaning, I wouldn't mind seeing
You snapping out them jeans like you got
No clothes, no clothes, no clothes, no clothes, no clothes

[Bridge]
He like the way I rock my hips, see that?
Pop, lock, and drop it, I see that, pop, lock and drop it
Whoa I love how you be leaning, yeah I'm leaning
Aw, shawty am I dreaming? You ain't dreaming
All I'm tryna say is, girl I'm seeing you
Seeing you, seeing you
With no clothes on
No clothes on
No clothes, baby

[Chorus]
But I can picture you with no clothes on
Girl I gotta have it, I'm attracted
The way you dancing, looking back at it
No clothes on
Everybody leaning, I wouldn't mind seeing
You snapping out them jeans like you got
No clothes on
I can picture you with no clothes on
Girl I gotta have it, I'm attracted
The way you dancing, looking back at it
No clothes on
Everybody leaning, I wouldn't mind seeing
You snapping out them jeans like you got
No clothes on, take it off
