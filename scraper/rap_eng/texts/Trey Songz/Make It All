[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Ask if we ever made love before
She said we never make love no more
I guess she just talking in general
She said she never even been in love
The only want a body
And I know just what it feels like
And I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry
'Cause I know just what it feels like

[Verse 2: MIKExANGEL]
I don't wanna be alone, baby
They say nothing's set in stone, baby
I got options I can choose, hate being confused
And I been so cold lately

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
I don't wanna be alone, baby
I been getting so drunk lately
Baby, I been getting stoned, mentally, I'm gone
I can't even go lately

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
I can't, I can't even call, babe
I been feeling lonely
You been feeling lonely
We been getting closer
You don't wanna call when it's time to make it all, make it all okay
She make it all okay
Make it all, make it all, make it all okay
Oh, make it all okay
