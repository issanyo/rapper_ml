[Intro]
Skrt, skrt
Skrt, skrt
How do you even do that shit? Let's go
Let me hold that shit

[Verse 1]
Deep off in the valley, yeah hoe, that's where I stay
When the house phone ring, yeah that mean you at the ga
Said her ex keep calling and that nigga in the way
Sent a ticket to her iPhone, now she on the way
Touchdown in LA, yeah she beg for the trip
Shawty bad as fuck, shit, with them Dolly Parton tits
Uber never coming here, told her I'mma send a Lyft
Canada John's coming here since 2006
And you can never fuck me, girl if you ain't sucking dick
And no we never fucking, 'less you hear that wrapper rip
Uber never coming here, throwing hoes in the Lyft
Uber never coming here, throwing hoes in the Lyft

[Verse 2]
She ain't never been, so I took her out the hive
We should call another Lyft, they can't fit up in the ride
Freak rolls in the 5th, 3 hoes in the VIP
3 hoes turn to 6, I'm too old for this shit
Need another old Perc, shit who ever got it works
She got Xans in her purse, got my hand up her skirt
Rolling with some niggas that don't play to fuck around
Hey girl, I know you know them niggas, they should stay the fuck from round
Shooters every fucking where, even when I'm outta town
Shoot from every fucking where, even when we outta bounds
You a referee snitching and a referee missing
Where you get your pills from? Who fill out that prescription?
Where you get your heels from? Who got you them 6 inches?
All types of signs on, homies Blood and Cripping
All types of lines, swear I caught some bitches sniffing
Uber never coming here, if we did, it would be different

[Hook]
Uber never coming here, throwing hoes in the Lyft
Uber never coming here, tell them hoes get they shit
Uber never coming here, throwing hoes in the whip
Uber never coming here cause we far as a bitch
