[Intro]
Sun won't shine, moon won't glow
This star of mine, is my star no more
I did you wrong and this I know
Come keep me warm, please, girl, I'm so cold
Woah, let me talk to you

[Verse 1]
Cold winter nights, by myself
Blankets just won't do, I need your help
'Cause I don't wanna miss the way your body feels no more
No I don't
It's only been two days since you've been gone
But those few moments, feel so long
Now I'm sitting at the edge of the bed, with my hands on my head
And the only thing I been thinking while I been alone is that

[Chorus]
I can't let you go, I won't let you leave
One thing that I know is baby, you were made for me for sure
My life is in your hands, I'm meant to be your man
We're made to be together
So baby no, don't go
Girl, if you don't know, I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul for sure
I'm right here on my knees
If you were to leave, I'd lose my everything

[Verse 2]
You complete me baby
Don't you let, nothing come, between us, hey
Alcohol has been, my best friend
And I admit some tears, have passed my chin
Crying in the bed over you, just ain't manly
But I don't give a damn, no
'Cause I could wash these pillow cases, I could change these sheets baby
But I need you back in the crib cooking up some of that good chicken and gravy
Mash potatoes, homemade lemonade
Want you back to the old days, you been with me since I had long braids

[Chorus]
And I can't let you go, I won't let you leave
One thing that I know is baby, you were made for me for sure
My life is in your hands, I'm meant to be your man
We're made to be together
So baby no, don't go
Girl, if you don't know, I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul for sure
I'm right here on my knees
If you were to leave, I'd lose my everything

[Bridge]
Girl my heart won't beat right, I can't sleep nights
Ooh you're haunting my dreams
All I know is I hold onto memories
When you touch, I touch you
When you moaning, you scream, oh baby
Girl, you know just what you do to me
I acted so stupidly
And unless you want to take away my soul, no, don't go

[Chorus]
I can't let you go, I won't let you leave
One thing that I know is baby, you were made for me for sure
My life is in your hands, I'm meant to be your man
We're made to be together
So baby no, don't go
Girl, if you don't know, I'd give my heart, I'd give my soul for sure
I'm right here on my knees
If you were to leave, I'd lose my everything

[Outro]
Don't you go away, stop, I can't
No baby no, don't you go away, I just, I just need time
Don't you leave me girl, don't do this
Don't you leave me girl, please
Don't you leave me girl, I got a lot on my mind
Don't you leave me girl, baby, babe, baby stop it, okay
Were made to be together, I'll stay
