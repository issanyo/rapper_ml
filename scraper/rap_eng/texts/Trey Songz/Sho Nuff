[Verse 1]
Baby, I would be a liar
If I said that you weren't always on my mind
And I don't wanna be a liar
So I'ma tell you right now that I be thinkin' 'bout you all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Your touch won't fade away
Your kiss won't fade away
Your lovin' is here to stay
I never stop feeling you
I never stop, no
I never stop, no
I never stop feeling you
I never stop, no
I never stop feeling you, babe

[Chorus]
Baby, let me take my time
Go slow with you, if that's alright
Been a really long time
Tell me that it's still mine
Is you still my baby?
She say sho' you right, sho nuff
Is you still my baby? Sho nuff
You got this all night
Baby, let me take my time
Go slow with you, if that's alright
Been a really long time
Tell me that it's still mine
Is you still my baby?
She say sho you right
She say sho you right, sho nuff
Is you still my baby? Sho nuff
Been a really long time
Tell me that it's still mine, sho nuff
Been a really long time
Tell me that it's still mine, sho nuff

[Verse 2]
Girl, grippin' on your body like some pliers
'Cause I don't wanna never, ever let you get away, right
You my one true desire
So I'ma listen to whatever your body finna say

[Pre-Chorus]
Your touch won't fade away
Your kiss won't fade away
Lovin' is here to stay, right
On my knees I pray, I pray that it's still mine

[Chorus]
Baby, let me take my time
Go slow with you, if that's alright
Been a really long time
Tell me that it's still mine
Is you still my baby?
She say sho you right, sho nuff
Is you still my baby? Sho nuff
You got this all night
Baby, let me take my time
Go slow with you, if that's alright
Been a really long time
Tell me that it's still mine
Is you still my baby?
She say sho you right
She say sho you right, sho nuff
Is you still my baby? Sho nuff
Been a really long time
Tell me that it's still mine, sho nuff
Been a really long time
Tell me that it's still mine, sho nuff
