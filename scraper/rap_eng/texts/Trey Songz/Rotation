[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Yeah, girl you fine, hella fine, so fine, damn right, yeah, that's my observation
Think you need a little time, hella time layin' in the sunshine, vacation
Old nigga had you cuffed but I know he fucked up, now he on probation
Got you-got you-got you switchin' up, rotation

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
He don't do it-he don't do it like me
Girl you sweet as ice tea, know you sweet as Hi-C, yeah
They gon' want to fight me, they should high-five me
They don't see what I see
Lock 'em down, even get to see the IG
Lock 'em-lock 'em down, even get to see the IG
My lil' baby choose like she was a hypebeast
She walk in the room, coulda heard a mice squea-, wait
He don't do it-he don't do it like me
Girl you sweet as ice tea, know you sweet as Hi-C, yeah
And you know you got me, and you know he not me
I'm Balboa, Rocky
Sister long, get it on 'til you knock me (Sheesh)

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Dave East]
Yeah, girl you fine, hella fine, so fine, damn right, yeah, that's my observation
Think you need a little time, hella time layin' in the sunshine, vacation
Old nigga had you cuffed but I know he fucked up, now he on probation (I got you fucked up)
Got you, got you, got you switchin' up, rotation (Got you)

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Me and a couple bros goin' to Vegas (We out)
Respected in the streets, I don't care if I'm on your playlist (Nah)
The only way we showin' up is if you sent that payment (Pay)
Keep calling me, in love with R&B, we fucked to Trey shit (My nigga)
We the ones that they talk about, it's so hard not to mention us (Hard)
Too lazy for a room, fucked in my Benz, I had to tint it up (Skrt)
This bitch a freak, ain't got no time to eat, we put that dinner up
Workin' all week, don't ask 'bout the weekend she 'bout to spend with us (Shh)
We got 'em in rotation
So glad I'm off probation (Glad)
Come to me, don't do no chasin'
Kill 'em all, I think I'm Jason (All)
She never paid attention, now she begging me to taste it
Brought her to another world, I picked that bitch up in a spaceship
Trigga know that this's gang shit

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Yeah, girl you fine, hella fine, so fine, damn right, yeah, that's my observation
Think you need a little time, hella time layin' in the sunshine, vacation
Old nigga had you cuffed but I know he fucked up, now he on probation
Got you,-got you-got you switchin' up, rotation (Switchin' up)
Got you,-got you-got you switchin' up, rotation (Switchin' up)
Got you,-got you-got you switchin' up, rotation (Switchin' up)

[Outro: Trey Songz]
Switchin' up, switchin' up, switchin' up, switchin' up, switchin' up,  switchin'  switchin' up up
Switchin' up, switchin' up, switchin' up, switchin' up, switchin' up,  switchin'  switchin' up up
Switchin' up, switchin' up, switchin' up, switchin' up, switchin' up,  switchin'  switchin' up up
