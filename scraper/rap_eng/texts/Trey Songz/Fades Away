[Verse 1]
My heart is beating fast, my hands won't stop shaking
I thought that we would last, I thought that we would make it
I guess I was wrong all along
We were inseparable but apart we've grown

[Chorus]
So, can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone?
When you look around, you're all alone 'cause all the right went wrong
Tell me how you look into my face and say, "Baby, I can't stay"
What do you do when the love just fades away?

[Verse 2]
The situation's ugly, I miss the way you touch me
Do you even want me anymore? Let me know
'Cause I'm tryna to figure us out, I don't wanna break up
What's the use when there ain't nothing left?

[Chorus]
So, can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone?
When you look around, you're all alone 'cause all the right went wrong
Tell me how you look into my face and say, "Baby, I can't stay"
What do you do when the love just fades away?

[Bridge]
Was this ever true? Did I ever love you?
Baby, we were caught up in the feeling, girl
Did you ever care for me 'cause if so then where'd it go?
Are we giving up? I need to know or are we holding on?

[Chorus]
Can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone?
When you look around, you're all alone 'cause all the right went wrong
Tell me how you look into my face and say, "Baby, I can't stay"
What do you do when the love just fades away?
Can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone?
When you look around, you're all alone 'cause all the right went wrong
Tell me how you look into my face and say, "Baby, I can't stay"
What do you do when the love just fades away?
Can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone?
When you look around, you're all alone 'cause all the right went wrong
Tell me how you look into my face and say, "Baby, I can't stay"
What do you do when the love just fades away?
