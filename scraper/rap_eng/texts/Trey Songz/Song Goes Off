[Verse 1]
Know you imagined too
You and me getting back too
You and me been past due
Nothing else matters, let's talk about it the morning after
Girl, they won't know if we take off
All your friends in the bathroom drunk
I just can't let you walk off
Still got some pieces to my heart

[Chorus]
So good to see you here
We both know it's been too long
Show me just how you feel
Before the song goes off
Back like we used to
This time I won't lose you
I still adore you
You always loyal
I'm gon' show you just how I feel
Before the song goes off

[Verse 2]
Who's making love to you?
Heard you was making oohs
Heard that he love you too
But that don't really matter, let's talk about it the morning after
You know I won't make you choose
But your friends talking to my crew
That leaves only me and you
Tell me what we have to lose

[Chorus]
So good to see you here
We both know it's been too long
Show me just how you feel
Before the song goes off
Back like we used to
This time I won't lose you
I still adore you
You always loyal
I'm gon' show you just how I feel
Before the song goes off
So good to see you here
We both know it's been too long
Show me just how you feel
Before the song goes off

[Interlude]
Hey baby, I just, I just don't know
It's like you complete me and I'm lost
The chances are I ran into you, like one in a billion

[Bridge]
Tell me, would you please
I know you still love me, yeah
Tell me, baby girl, tell me
I know you care for me

[Chorus]
It's so good to see you here
We both know it's been too long
Show me just how you feel
Before the song goes off
Back like we used to
This time I won't lose you
I still adore you
You always loyal
I'm gon' show you just how I feel
Before the song goes off

[Outro]
Who's making love to you?
Heard you was making oohs
But that don't really matter
Let's talk about it the morning after
