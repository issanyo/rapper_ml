[Verse 1]
And the days are gone
When you and I would take a walk
Yeah, to the place where no one knows of

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I'm a ghost looking for you
It hurts but it's true

[Chorus]
That I will never, ever see you again
And I'll never, ever hold you again
In my arms, never, ever again
And I will never, ever feel you again
But I will always love you the same
My girl, never, ever again
I wish we had a little more luck in love

[Verse 2]
Now you are long gone
But I still got your birthday card
Yeah, with a stamp and no address

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh now I can't stop dreaming 'bout you
I'm a lost star without you
It hurts but it's true

[Chorus]
That I will never, ever see you again
And I'll never, ever hold you again
In my arms, never, ever again
And I will never, ever feel you again
But I will always love you the same
My girl, never, ever again
I wish we had a little more luck in love

[Bridge]
Suddenly it hits me hard
To the point where it breaks my heart
Such a major low
We're ever gonna touch again, no

[Chorus]
I will never, ever see you again
And I'll never, ever hold you again
In my arms, never ever, again
I wish we had a little more luck in love
Never, ever again
Never, ever again
Never again
