[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey you can catch me in Atlanta with my pedal to the floor
On that 599 guts like a bloody nose
Ain't no secret how I kick it nigga everybody know
Bout my paper sorry no time for you haters gotta go
When im on the westcoat in that ghost on that low
One 5 for a movie, quarter mil for a show
Gotta pill in a bottle for the rod for a ho
Sweet heart to a lady, still hard on a ho
Thank god for my lady I know they be on that radio wiling
While we chilling somewhere on an island, smiling
On a big yacht is he really that hot
Ain't you too niggga guess not
Bitches hoppin on my dick, 'fore I hop up out the car
Walk away with 5 or 6 as im passing by the bars
See im tuggin on my zipper as I fire up my cigar
Lets get this straight, you go get naked get it crackin till tomorrow

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Yeah we in the same book, but I'm on another page (capeesh)
King off the leash out the cage on the streets
Kill niggas like AIDS, cut bitches like blades
Shine always, fuck you when whatever y'all say
Bitch nigga I'm paid even when I'm locked up
Heard nigga went broke, well shawty not us
Caught a case, did a bid, they say shawty washed up
To a bitch, bullshit then shawty popped off in yo motherfucking town
Just to show it's going down
My brother and my lil cousin got you lady goin round
Nigga I dont want her, I'm so superior by far
She'll never see the inside of my car
