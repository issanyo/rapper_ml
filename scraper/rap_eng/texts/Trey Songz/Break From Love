[Chorus]
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
I don't want to break, I don't want to break from us
After all we've been through so much, woah
I don't want to break, I don't want to break from love

[Verse 1]
You called me, I tried to shake the other night
In a hurry, guess you didn't have the time
To wait on my broken promises
I sought you, the reason with no rhyme

[Pre-Chorus]
We tried to work it out, we tried way back when
Your heart was spilling over without an end
I hurt you once before I hurt you again
You lost the faith that you had, had trusted in
So

[Chorus]
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
After all we've been through so much, woah
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from love
A break from love
A break from love

[Verse 2]
This journey will have its ups and downs
Sustaining will last a test of trial
This burning will only last a while
First degree burns don't leave scars
We can turn this pain around

[Pre-Chorus]
We tried to work it out, we tried way back when (way back when)
Your heart was spilling over without an end (without an end)
I hurt you once before I hurt you again (again and again)
You lost the faith that you had (yeah), had trusted in (trusted in)
So

[Chorus]
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
After all we've been through so much, woah
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from love
A break from love
A break from love
A break from love
A break from love
