But you'll never love a scrub
Cause you want the finer things
Tough love

Fuck to the floor

I hit the gas and I blow it away
I hit that ass and I sent her away
She just so happy I hit her today
Just got some money, I'm finna get paid
Just got some pussy, I'm finna get laid
Fuck is you talking, I been so VA
Fuck is you talking like you been in VA
Watch what you say boy
You don't want no problems

I go so crazy mixin' with the vodka
And I got the steak, the shrimp, and the lobster
She wanna fuck me but she want some money
She should know that she ain't gettin' nothin' from me
I don't know why these niggas lookin' for me
I don't know... (trails off)
