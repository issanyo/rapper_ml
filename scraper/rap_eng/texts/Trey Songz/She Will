[Verse 1 - Trey Songz]
I told her, go go
Pop that pussy get my dick wetter
All the hoes think I’m hot shit so they pissed at her
Niggas show envy but that don’t offend me
I wanna go to heaven where the angels free of sin be
They saying that I’m surrounded by the devils that’s within me
They say cash make you change, but that ain’t no epiphany
Cause I would say the same, dead faces making sense to me
Life moving fast so I’m quickly making history
I’m bullshit proof, if I kick it this shit’s truth
Like I’m stepping on the five, cause Abe Lincoln never lie
It’s such a crazy world you just somebody baby girl
What goes up must come down, look at that paper girl
I keep getting higher though, top kinda quitet though
Trigger man eating all you niggas on a diet ho
Hot a grip on the game make me beat you with these pliers
I put her body to work and she do whatever’s required

[Drake - Hook]
She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and tell me baby, its real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won’t
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

[Verse 2]
She will cause I’m one of those, what you wanna know?
I told her
Go go make that pussy splash
Nah, never did the dougie but I do that make your pussy dance
I’m the truth bitch, haters telling lies
They know I’m the shit and they be on it like some flies
I tell them get a life but they so concerned with mine
Ah, and bitches fighting is the last thing on my mind
This money mountain watch how fast a nigga climb
Like the hands on the Rollie, I’m just passing through the time
(You're nobody)
Till the paparazzi spot you and shot you … when the crib is colossal
Put my cheese and my lettuce over the beef like a taco
You niggers sweeter than syrup circle of squares like a waffle
Want a picture I got you but baby listen not now
Bitches keep they bottoms up cause I keep my top down
Flow’s overload like I keep them stock pilled
And it’s money over hoes, so I tell them squat down, now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Its ignorance that won’t allow, the listeners
They listen when the blistering the whispers
Do nothing to my significance
Competition non-existent, less I’m the mirror then
I’m kinda scared of him, tell myself beware of him
Meet my money on the double like it was a pair of them
You niggas fucking joking right? You niggas smoking
Like your favorite rapper saying some thought provoking
Cadence and lyric is dope but it just be fucking boastin'
You talking about some real shit you must be fucking broke
Or wanna be fucking broke
Radio ain’t gonna play that shit
They gonna play that hit, I don’t give a fuck what you say
That neo-soul ain’t gonna pay, hey
Truthfully I wanna be conscious as Marve Gaye
But I feed a lot of people, yeah they eating entree
Money turn boys to men like Wanya
Well at least … this other niggas …hold up wait.. Who yall talkin to?
