[Verse 1]
I ain't gon' say much
I'mma finish what's in my cup
And come over there with you
Sip a lil something with you
I ain't even gonna lie
You're lookin' kinda hella fly
Like you belong up in my ride
Cause baby tonight I...

[Pre-Hook]
Make yourself at home
Tonight you won't be alone
It's all about you girl
And me girl
You can take off tomorrow
Tonight we rollin' five star
It's all on you girl
What it do girl

[Hook]
Baby make a choice
You can hear it in my voice
I'm so sincere, listen here
I want you girl (Aye)
I want you girl (Aye)
I want you girl (Aye-aye)
Baby once we touch
You can never get enough
I got that good, so what's good
I want you girl (Aye)

[Verse 2]
I know they say Trey wild
But don't you dig Trey's style
If it's you girl
It's all cool girl

[Pre-Hook]
Make yourself at home
Tonight you won't be alone
It's all about you girl
And me girl
You can take off tomorrow
Tonight we rollin' six star
It's all on you girl
What it do girl

Baby make a choice
You can hear it in my voice

[Verse 3]
It seems as though
Your resistance could be broke
But I promise I won't go unless you do (don't you)
Don't be so cold
Let me keep you warm
Hold you through the night
You'll be satisfied

[Hook]
Baby make a choice
You can hear it in my voice
I'm so sincere, listen here
I want you girl (Aye)
I want you girl (Aye)
I want you girl (Aye-aye)
Baby once we touch
