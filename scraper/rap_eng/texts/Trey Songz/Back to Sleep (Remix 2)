[Intro: Chris Brown]
So let me fuck you back
So let me fuck you back

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
I just wanna rock you all night long
So give me what both want, good love
I wanna get into you so deep I'm touching your soul
No holding back, baby, let go
I'm about to hit that, it's 'bout to make you climax
Know that you can get back to sleep soon
Or you can take the day off so that I can stay off in it
We can blast off to the moon
Let me dive deep in your mind
Ain't got time, you're lost and I feel it
I know you're ready for this sexual healing

[Chorus: Chris Brown & August Alsina]
Just let me rock (Rock, rock)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh (Oh, girl)
Don't say a word, no, girl, don't you talk (Don't stop it now, don't stop it now, oh yeah)
Just hold on tight to me, girl (Oh)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, rock you back

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Deep, babe (Ooh), I know exactly how to treat you
Fuck you like a poet, babe (Beg for it), you're nasty and I know it, babe (Yeah, lie for it)
I'm talking mind sex, 'cause I'll fuck your mind first
Then I fuck you crazy, you'll cum every time
Baby, you know daddy's home, baby, you know that's right
Spit on it, choke, grab on your throat, cum for me, beg for it
Baby, I got that bomb dick (Yeah)
Tell your sister and your mom (Oh yeah) that I don't beg
'Cause I fuck you like I hate you (Oh), but I kiss you like I miss you
Ooh, you got that jacuzzi and I got that Messi for you all night long

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Miguel]
Just let me rock (Oh, baby)
I'ma fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh (Open up, open up, baby girl)
No, don't you talk (All night)
Just hold on tight to me, girl (Oh)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, can rock you back

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Baby, I know it's late, yeah, I've been so frustrated
Today's been a little bit hard on me and I just had to call and tell you I'm missing you
Oh, all the things I'll do to you once I get in the room
I hope you're in the mood
Just leave the keys to the door, the same place you left them before
I'll be there around 4, you know what I came for
Oh, baby, assume the position, we 'bout to try every position all night
Playing games, tomorrow you gon' have to redo them braids
'Cause I'ma sweat 'em out, baby, spread 'em out
You know what to do with them legs and I know what to do with this head
'Cause you got all of the right features
Baby, you're wet as the Caribbean beaches
I wanna dive all in your sea
Girl, let me fuck you back to sleep

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz & Both]
Just let me rock (And let me love you, baby, oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh (Rock you with the D, girl)
Don't say a word, no, girl, don't you talk
Just hold on tight to me, girl (Fuck you back to sleep, girl)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, and rock you back (Fuck you back to sleep, girl)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, girl), yeah, yeah
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love (Rock you back, oh)
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, girl, ooh)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
