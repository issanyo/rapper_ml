[Intro: Trey Songz]
Uh, yeah
You gon' make me turn into the old me, yeah
These niggas keep on actin' like they know me, yeah
Gotta have at least a hunnid to promote me, yeah
Gotta bust it open for my nigga Swae Lee

[Verse 1: Swae Lee & Trey Songz]
Tell me all your secrets, baby, come clean
You and me tonight and you'll be complete
If they don't do right by you then leave 'em
Drop-top, bitch, I'm flyin', I ain't speedin'
Make my own place, yeah, I make my own cash
Talkin' 'bout relations, you don't know me like that
Touch you like I'm never gonna see you
Fuck you like I'm never gonna see you
Say you never did, I can't believe you
Bottle after bottle plus your pain reliever
Ta-tas on her model, she's a leader
Hot stuff, think I want her, matter fact I need her
Hot stuff, yeah, I want her, matter fact I need her
Talk stuff all you wanna, when I see, I'm beatin'
When I flash cheese, she's cheesin'
Baby, I get fly for no reason

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Body high and she fuck my mind
You extend your stay just to go night-night?
Body high and you're on my mind
Did you wait all day just to go night-night?

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Swae Lee]
She know she turn me on (Know she turn me on)
She know she turn me on, she 'bout to ride it out
She 'bout to ride it out
Go spend my money up
I'm 'bout to try her out
She slipped her panties off
She fuckin' wit' me tough
I had enough of drugs (I had enough of drugs, yeah)
She took me outside and- (She took me, she took me, she took me)
She took me outside and- (She took me, she took me, she took me)
She took me outside and- (She took me, she took me, she took me)
She fucked me outside and- (She took me, she took me, she took me)

[Verse 2: Trey Songz & Swae Lee]
Tell me all your secrets, baby, come clean
When you're next to me lookin' like a young queen
Makin' movies tonight, it's only one scene
Girl, you make it move like I never ever done seen
Baby, we should do somethin' special, show you something
Fuck that foreplay, baby, do that one thing
Fuck what all these whores say if I ever told you one thing
Girl, the microphone for you if you ever wanna come sing
All over that body like some sunscreen
Player high suite with the beach view (Oooh)
She was only doin' what the freaks do
Swae said that he know her, I told him, "Me too"
Trigga-Trigga, how these finna creep through?
You a sneak, hatin', but we peeped you
Comin' from the party, cannot reach you
'Fore I hit, I need to get a preview

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Body high and she fuck my mind
You extend your stay just to go night-night?
Body high and you're on my mind
Did you wait all day just to go night-night?

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Swae Lee]
She know she turn me on (Know she turn me on)
She know she turn me on, she 'bout to ride it out
She 'bout to ride it out (She 'bout to ride it out)
Go spend my money up (Go spend my money up)
I'm 'bout to try her out (I'm 'bout to try her out)
She slipped them panties off (She slipped them panties off)
She fuckin' wit' me tough (She fuckin' wit' me tough)
I had enough of drugs (I had enough of drugs, yeah)
She took me outside and- (She took me, she took me, she took me)
She took me outside and- (She took me, she took me, she took me)
She took me outside and- (She took me, she took me, she took me)
She fucked me outside and- (She took me, she took me, she took me)

[Outro: Trey Songz]
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Whoo-whoo-whoo
She took me, she took me
She took me, she took me
She took me, took me
Took me, took me
She took me, took me
Took me, took me
