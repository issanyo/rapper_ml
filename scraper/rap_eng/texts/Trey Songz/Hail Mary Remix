(Intro)

(Hail Mary, Hail Mary, Hail Mary)
It’s Trigga (Bussa Buss)
(Trig, what’s happenin’ nigga?)
I got that game (I got that game)
I caught a play (I caught a play)
We goin’ long (we goin’ long)
Do what I say (do what I say)
I’ve got my game face on (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got my game face on, come on
The conglomerate, baby!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
I don’t want a war, drop them drawers
How it feel? Shit
Peep how they applaud
When I walk out on that field, bitch
Y’all already know the way I’m moving, anyway
I do this every day
Watch the way we execute the play
Fuck the shit you say!
Feelin’ kinda sloppy, Nouveau Gotti
With the coup today
Mami, what my niggas do, I’m sorry
Yeah, they shoot the K
Here you know the motto
See we gotta get the loot and pray
For my enemies, pop them bottles
Follow suit and spray
Fuck the ref, nigga
Fuck the foul call
Hit her with the dick, she cursed me
For hittin’ her with my foul ball
You can bring your friends, little mami
You know my style, though
‘Case you ain’t know, we ride on
[Hook: Trey Songz]

Hey girl you say you like it deep, Hail Mary
Hey girl you know the play, Hail Mary
Tonight we going long, yeah, we be goin’ long
Hey, huddle up, Hail Mary
I ain’t tryin’ to punt, Hail Mary
Tonight we goin’ long
We be goin’ long, Hail Mary

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I got my chopper in my ‘rari
In case I see my enemies
I don’t know what’s gotten into me
Tonight I’m on this Hennessy
I won’t usually do the brown
But tonight is special (special)
Sam Rothstein be my agenda, yeah my special
My 2-door is retarded
I call that bitch special-ed
I don’t even know her name
I just call her special-ed
Another year, same haters, usual suspects
Worried ’bout another nigga
I swear that shit is suspect
Keyser Soze, sold the yay, and I got away
Hit the club, bay air fresh, in case I die today
Hail Mary, told her it’s the world, ain’t got shit to lose
’Bout to go long, celebrate, like I’m Cindy Cruse

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Whatever you want I got it
Got a drop-top in my pocket
You pop it, you watch it
Keep on poppin’ and I’mma drop it
So hard to be alone, anyone’ll go
But right here at this moment
You the one I want to roll, so
You got the ball baby, it’s in your hands
I’mma be the coach, I’mma let you know the plan
What’s next is, baby you and me exit
What now? I’ma get you naked
Do a little bit of sexin’
Touch down
And once you let me score
I’mma wanna score again
Double O, triple O, baby I’mma play to win
Say the best stuff, and see some good D
Hey girl I heard you like it deep

[Hook]
[Verse 4: Lil’ Wayne]
Tunchi in this muthafucka
Hail Mary, full of grace
I don’t remember her name
But I remember how her pussy tastes
I go long, so long, she love the way that I put it down
Got you goin’ in circles, all you gotta do is look around
I’m Mr. Right and she’s Ms. Tonight
Pussy so nice, gotta kiss it twice
Pussy so tight my tongue get stuck
My tongue get stuck like lickin’ ice
Hoes call me QB, I throw that dick too deep
I told her she’s the preacher’s wife
She said practice what you preach
She said “ah, me so horny, he love me long time”
I say how ‘bout 69, she say numbers don’t lie
I say true, you ain’t never told no lie
You ain’t never told no lie
And you know they say love is blind
So close your eyes
