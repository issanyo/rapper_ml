LILMARIOSANTANA: AYE QUE LET ME JUMP ON THIS ONE TIME

[HOOK:QUE]
My main bitch and my side bitch mad at me
I could give two fucks
Bout to pour me up some Easter pink
I need two cups
Roll up dope, say "I smoke too much"
Hold up, ho you don't smoke enough
Fall out ho you can't go with us
Yeah you bad, but ho so what?

[VERSE 1:LILMARIOSANTANA]
My Chick Say I Do Too Much , Loco Got Two
Cups. They Both Stuffed Up , You Know Whats

Living (2x). Yea They Sippin , Two Cups
Little Nigga Yea They Sippin , They Stay
Getting High , Loco Got The Purp. & I Bury
These Niggas In The Dirt. YRN For Life!

[VERSE 2: QUE]
They say a young nigga do way too much
Roll dope, get high, and don't say too much
Stackin' up dough they say I made too much
Got a get money gut, like I ate too much
I'm gone, roll one up and get blown
Both of my bitches, they know what's really goin' on
I guess that's why they both pissed at me
They call theyselves tryna play tricks on me
One bitch tryna post pics of me
Man, the other one say I act differently
Well, I can get too fucked
All I need is two cups
We go along with two sluts
I don't really want too much

[Bridge + Hook]
My main bitch and my side bitch mad at me
I could give two fucks
Bout to pour me up some Easter pink
I need two cups
Roll up dope, say "I smoke too much"
Hold up, ho you don't smoke enough
Fall out ho you can't go with us
Yeah you bad, but ho so what?

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Probably bout havin' a threesome, they say I do it too much
It's probably gonna be another hit
Fuckin' up a nigga bitch, doin' too much
And I don't even drink lean, but a nigga sippin' two cups
Cause she just got 'em done, and her booty next
Is she doin' too much?
I came in with a thug, gave a stripper love
Then I threw too much
Say that she can hang, her and her girls
Then the bitch threw up
Man, I miss the A too much
When I come I always stay too much
All the girls that I love say I play too much
Life full of sin, can never pray too much
