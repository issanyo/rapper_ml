[Hook: Trey Songz]

Looking for a new girl, they say the fresher the better
Know that it's whatever with the cheddar
Looking for a new girl, ain't gon' love her forever
If she wanna fall I'mma let her
Looking for a new girl, new girl new girl new girl
Tonight I want a new girl a new girl, new girl new girl new girl

[Verse 1: CyHi]

Big booty small waist, I be with her all day
Took her on a mall date
She picked up when I called late
Let me crash at her crib, I just call her Allstate
Everyday we have a wedding cause all I get is tall cake, Prynce
But I know how to handle a queen, Alexander McQueen
I'm the man of your dreams
Look at my outfit, girl I'm janitor clean
We're chillin', watchin' Tv I got my hand in her jeans
She say she want a soldier well girl I am a marine
And she love good music, she a fan of the team
So what you wanna do girl, let me rock them boots girl cause I'm

[Verse 2: CyHi]

I don't want nothing but some company, ha
A country girl from Montgomery, yeah
Or a bad bitch from D.C
Who wanna cook and do a little laundry
And let me hit the pussy monthly
Fly back outta town and she don't call a nigga constantly
But she still keep in touch
She got her own money, she don't need a crutch
Where my New York chicks at?
Who wanna chief of dutch
Let me kiss you in your mouth while I squeeze your butt
But, so let me know if that's you girl cause I'm single and I'm

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 3: CyHi]

Cause lately I've been looking for a Chelsea
Fuck being rich girl I'm tryna live wealthy
Put some Red Bottoms on you, purses with the LVs
Catch a jet from San Diego, watch me pull a LT
Just to see your fine ass
Girl you can call, tweet, text, or e-mail me
She love young money, I swear she a Chanel freak
Life's good, LG
Type hood and she inhale tree
She like wood in my hotel suite
And once I finish sweatin' out her cute curls
I caught a plane to a new city now I'm back
