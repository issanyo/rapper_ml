[Intro: Trey Songz]
League of Starz...
Sorry Jaynari...
Ay Eric What up
Ay Ay Ay (yuup)

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
If they ain't lookin' I don't want her (I don't want her)
I don't want her (I don't want her)
If you had her you would only disappoint her
And you know I had to go and do the remix, on some G-shit

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want that girl
No

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Uh
Yeah she bad nigga
Look at them titties and her ass nigga
Tryna say she was a gold digger
You broke how would you know nigga
I tell her wear the short dress
Touchin' all 'tween her legs
We about to turn the section to a bed
I see 'em lookin' at my woman
If they ain't lookin' I don't want that girl, no

[Hook: Eric Bellinger & Trey Songz]
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want that girl
No

[Verse 3: Eric Bellinger]
There's a lot of lame niggas who don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout (talkin' 'bout)
This song ain't for them
It's for all my girls with the short skirts and they top out (top out)
Baby you gon' need a real man, you gon' need a real man
When I understand when they lookin' at you, it's a compliment
Oh girl you better shake what your mamma gave you
If you got it then flaunt it that's all I'm tryna say to you

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
I see 'em looking at my woman, yeah yeah
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want that girl
No

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger x2]
If they ain't looking at my baby
Then it’s something wrong with me
If they ain't hating on what we got
I’mma need a new woman

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
If they ain't looking I don’t want her (I see ya, I can see 'em looking)
If they ain't looking I don’t want that girl (I don't want her)
Oooh (no I don't want her, hey)
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want her
If they ain't looking I don’t want that girl
No
