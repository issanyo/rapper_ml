[Intro]
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
(Ding dong, ding dong)

[Verse 1]
Guess who's coming to dinner tonight?
You gon' be a part of my meal tonight
Give me the body baby, I wanna bite
Trench coat over that skin tonight
Baby, it's not a mystery
I want you on top and kissing me
'Cause I've been waiting all night long
To get your love, let's get it on

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you baby, I said you, baby
Tonight, that liquor got a nigga so ready, yeah
Put my lips all over you, wanna put on a show for you
This bedroom is my Colosseum, ring my bell, I'll let you in

[Chorus]
I'ma get you naked, baby, my love will drive you crazy
Fast and slow and, baby, you gon' know when you ring
My doorbell, ring my doorbell, get it
Give you that ding dong, ding dong, you want that? Ding dong, ding dong

[Verse 2]
Guess who's coming to breakfast today?
Prancing all around with them pretty legs
When it's sunny side up, beat it like some eggs
'Cause there ain't nothing better than morning sex
Girl, it ain't a mystery
I want your lips kissing me
'Cause I've been waiting all day long
And I'm gon' tear your body up

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you baby, damn right I said you, baby
Right now, girl, you got a nigga so horny, yeah
Put my tongue all over you, wanna put on a show for you
This bedroom is my Colosseum, ring my bell, I'll let you in

[Chorus]
I'ma get you naked, baby, my love will drive you crazy
Fast and slow and, baby, you gon' know when you ring
My doorbell, ring my doorbell, get it
Give you that ding dong, ding dong, you want that? Ding dong, ding dong

[Bridge]
Girl, I pull up the gate, baby, don't be late
'Cause I've been waiting all this time for you
And baby, when you pull up to the drive way
And walk your way up the stairs, push that button and ring my bell

[Chorus]
I'ma get you naked, baby, my love will drive you crazy
Fast and slow and, baby, you gon' know when you ring
My doorbell, ring my doorbell, get it
Give you that ding dong, ding dong, you want that? Ding dong, ding dong
I'ma get you naked, baby, my love will drive you crazy
Fast and slow and, baby, you gon' know when you ring
My doorbell, ring my doorbell, get it
Give you that ding dong, ding dong, you want that? Ding dong, ding dong
