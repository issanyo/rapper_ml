[Verse 1]
This ain't a "models or the bottles in the club" R&B song (R&B song)
Girl, this that "look me in my eyes while you ride like give you all of me" songs, yeah
This ain't no "all up in your phone, tryna see what's going on" love song, noo
This that turn your phone off, this that do it 'til you can't no more, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't need no music 'cause we on repeat
She love to sing much as I love the beat
We do our thang when we fuck up the sheets
(We do our thang when we fuck up the sheets)

[Chorus]
I make your body pour, fuck up the sheets
Pick you right off the floor, when we fuck up the sheets
I get it wetter every time, fuck up the sheets
I drink that water like it's wine, fuck up the sheets
Don't need no music
She love to sing
Uhhh, uhh

[Verse 2]
This ain't no "threesome, baby, you can get your girl" fuck song, oh no
Girl, this that "yeah, you know you're mine, all the time" making love song, ooh
If you got the time, baby, I wanna watch
If you wanna grind, baby, then I'm on the clock, yeah
You got that working, baby, I give you the business, yeah
You probably have a baby in you when we finished
Got me losing my mind, found it between your legs
You thinking deeper, baby, I'm all in your head
This ain't a "models or the bottles in the club" R&B song
When we do it, we don't need no music

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't need no music 'cause we on repeat
She love to sing much as I love the beat
We do our thang when we fuck up the sheets, woah
We do our thang when we fuck up the sheets, oh

[Chorus]
I make your body pour, fuck up the sheets
Pick you right off the floor, when we fuck up the sheets
I get it wetter every time, fuck up the sheets
I drink that water like it's wine, fuck up the sheets
Don't need no music
She love to sing, sounding like
Uhhh, uhh
I love it, love it when we fucking, fuck up the sheets

[Outro]
Oh, ooh, baby
Fuck up the sheets
Fuck up the sheets
And she still keeps
And she still keeps
Guess I just go way too deep
But that's the way she ask for it
So that how she gon' get me
Yes, I love fucking up these sheets
(Yes, I love fucking up these sheets)
Yeah, take that, girl
Take it just like that there
Biting on my neck
This incredible sex got you screaming
"Oh, shit"
"God damn, hell yes"
While your nails peeling back my flesh
And she still keeps scratching me up
Digging in my skin once again, ooh
And she still keeps
She can't stop, scratching me up
Oooh, oh
She still keeps scratching me up
She can't stop, she won't stop
Girl, don't stop, girl, don't stop
And she still keeps scratching me up
Leaving marks on my mind
Snatching me up
And she still keeps scratching me up
I'll take your pain if you take mine
And she still keeps scratching me up
Oh, babe, oh, babe
Got her nails digging in my flesh
And she still keeps scratching me up
Woah, yeah
Digging in my skin once again, oh
And she still keeps scratching me up
She can't stop, oh, oh
And she still keeps scratching me up
And she still keeps scratching me up
Oh, babe
And she still keeps scratching me up
And she still keeps scratching me up
Tremaine
