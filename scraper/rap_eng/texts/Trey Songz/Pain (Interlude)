[Intro]
Passion, pain, pleasure
Hurts when I laugh sometimes
Feels good when I cry
Tell me when you're looking at me
Can you see the pain in my eyes?

[Verse]
As the stars shine deep in the night sky
As the sun sits way above the clouds
As the world spins, time and time again
Look at myself, wondering where I've been
City to city and girl with you one night's all I got to give
You don't know me no matter how I might appear
Will I ever know, why do I feel so alone?
Since a child I was told, all that glitters ain't gold
Got lost in the moment, tryna find what I wanted
So I'm drowning in regret and I'll never forget
Everything that I had before the good turned bad
