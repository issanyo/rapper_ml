[Intro: Fabolous]
You ever been lookin' for your keys and they're right there in your pocket? See that's what wrong, like, sometimes people lookin' for everybody else to give them the keys, and they're right there. See all you gotta do is kick it with your homie, or kick it with your shorty and see if they got their own keys to success or if they still lookin' for somebody else to give them the keys

[Hook: Quavo & YFN Lucci]
I got money way before the deal
Put my bitches in new pair of heels
I might fuck your hoe and pay her bills
Yeah we was taught to get it how we live, yeah
I got your hoe on a leash
Got a plug, he Vietnamese
We the niggas they wanna be
'Cause we got the key to the streets
We got the key to the streets
Hey, we got the key to the streets

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Look, you wanna be on your feet or you cool with bein' a leach?
Not tryna be on repeat, not tryna be here and preach
You tryna be out and eat or you tryna be on a leash?
If you gonna be in the streets, focus on bein' on Meech
I'm tryna be in the lead, I'm tryna be in that sheesh
I'm tryna be in the suite, telly that b on the beach
Shorty been bein' too sweet, want me to be on her peach
Her friend wanna be under me, might end up bein' in each
Stop talkin' like that when you be on them beats
Make sure the name never be in your speak
We get at you, we ain't bein' discrete
And you know hammers gon' be in the reach
Your chain got no ice like no drink bein' neat
Presi and real nigga should be impeached
That's why I don't get snatched
Oh you want some shit patched?
