[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I'm going non stop, my spot
You caught a vibe shootin' shots, why not?
Tell me the things you wan' do (Tell me)
Baby, I'ma do 'em to you (You)
I'm going non stop, my spot (Yeah)
You caught a vibe shootin' shots, why not?
Tell me the things you wan' do (What you wan' do?)
Baby, I'ma do 'em to you (You, yeah, yeah)

[Verse: Maybel Montez]
You got that mandatory loven it's fresh up out of the oven
After Tori, thinking bout women, how I can't trust them?
But you had it all and baby you had me
We got that type of love that's forever, no acting
This is real love, true love
Old ways, new stuff
Wait a second, dinner plans?
Blur, blur suit up
Girl I'm shooting 3's, that's word to Steph Curry
And I'm a Golden State nigga so you'd never worry
Cos I'm a bring it home every single time, yeah
And you'd be V.I.P just because you're mine, yeah
Shout out to Trigga that's my nigga, you a real one
And I'm a filter all these hits until the deal come, oh yeah

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Maybel Montez]
I'm going non stop, my spot
You caught a vibe shootin' shots, why not?
Tell me the things you wan' do (Tell me)
Baby, I'ma do 'em to you (You)
I'm going non stop, my spot (Yeah)
You caught a vibe shootin' shots, why not?
Tell me the things you wan' do (What you wan' do?)
Baby, I'ma do 'em to you (You, yeah, yeah)
