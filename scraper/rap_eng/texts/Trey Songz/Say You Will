[Verse 1 : Trey Songz]
We was so official
See the tears to my tissue?
On my shoulder was the tissue for her tears
I told my fears
She told me her fears
She said she'd do whatever so we'd make it through the years
So whys the moment here when we not together?
Thought we suppose to be forever
Sick to my stomach wanna vomit and Im bummin
I ain't got a hair cut in bout month and I be frontin
When you calling in the morning like you want it but you don't you just be frontin Why you frontin?
I'm abusing my substance doing a lot of puffing doing a lot of cussing'
Talking to myself like 'Trigga what happened?' (ha ha)
Yelling one minute next minute Im laughing
Next minute Im crying
Next minute Im dying
Pass me the Aspirin
Start to buck it all back then
Look at the sky like lord what you asking?
Why'd you take her away from me
Why'd she have to go
Father this is sudden and I only wanna know
Was supposed to plant my seed in her
We was supposed to grow
Is it what she said or another nigga though?
Ain't nobody can't nobody else be with my baby
See her with another man I'll probably go crazy
I am crazy
I'd kill him If I seen him
How I'm feeling I ain't playing
I am playing
Getting my Kanye in
Baby this is Trey and everyday they in a weigh-in
They be saying I dont be slaying these beats so maliciously
Tell me why you dissing me
I try to leave the mic alone she called an said she misses me I came back
Now ain't that sweet of me for me to be
Givin her what she need
All day its VA to The Bay to NY to LA
I been fly
I been passed guys in the rearview
Aye lookie hear you
I don't care what my pears do
Its alot of you's like seal food
So many fish in the sea
Only one me
Only 1 Songz
Ain't no one song I won't jump on and get my thump on
Beat the track up like it jumped on
My momma and thats on my Momma
And ain't no rhymer
Ain't no singer
Ain't no human
Ain't no creature that can fill my sneakers
I sound so good through the tweeters I smell so hood from the reefer
Yet Im tryna change my imagery but Im still real I ain't never been gimmicky
Said Im great now but image what Im finna be
I'm filled with flatery everytime they mimic me
Aye! im at the top of my game
An ain't nobody poppin my chain I dont even wear one but the goons gone bang
If you reach for any motherfuckin thing its Tremaine

[Outro]
Yeah, Kanye gon' sing
So Im gon' rap a little bit
I don't give a fuck about how you feel about it either
Bet that
You know, I was 23 a couple days ago
MJ'ing it
I guess now Im gonna get my Kobe on
Too forward
Still Im in the zone don't get that confused
I see you seeing me
I was in Petersburg for a couple days gave away a couple turkeys
Went to DC shut that down Friday night
Saturday went to Baltimore and shut that down
Sunday Im in the A, Red Velvet room
Now Im in the crib getting at it
What it do?
