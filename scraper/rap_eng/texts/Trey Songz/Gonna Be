[Intro: MIKExANGEL]
Woah, woah, yeah, baby

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
You never lie to me
I love your honesty
I know what you want from me
And that's what I'm gonna be
I love your company
So much you done for me
You deserve more from me
That's what I'm gonna be

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I'm 'bout to ride for ya
Look in my eyes, no lies
Girl, it ain't no disguise, no
I'm out my mind for ya
Girl, I go crazy, baby
Don't I, don't I go crazy
About your ass? Oh, I, yeah
I bet it all on my baby doll
Don't to my socks and drawers
And y'all know I will
Y'all know I will, yeah
I'm gon' tell the world that you're my girl
Niggas know I shoot to kill
But you for real, I'm too for real

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
You never lie to me
I love your honesty
I know what you want from me
And that's what I'm gonna be
I love your company
So much you done for me
You deserve more from me
That's what I'm gonna be

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I'm 'bout to ride for ya
Say it two times for ya
Baby, don't leave
Baby, don't make me weak
Make me cry for you
I know what you need
Leave it up to me
Give it to you better
And tell 'em that we never ask
When the say this night would last
Not forever

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
You never lie to me
I love your honesty
I know what you want from me
And that's what I'm gonna be
I love your company
So much you done for me
You deserve more from me
That's what I'm gonna be

[Outro: MIKExANGEL]
Oh, I, oh I
Ooh, ooh, baby, ooh, babe
And you know you're my fave
Don't have nothing on the side
Put your loving on a plate
I can eat you for breakfast
When I'm sucking on your breast
I got my tongue all up inside
Ooh, baby
When I'm sucking on your breast
I got my tongue all up inside
Ooh, baby
