[Talking]
Yup

I'ma tell you right now, nothing is safe!
Let's go, Songz (Songz), That right! (That right)
They gon' have to wait 'cuz I really do kill this shit
Stacks on deck, and baby you know the song
So sing along, c'mon

[Verse 1]

Shawty what it is though, you know who I is though
When we ready you can come, and you can let ya friend go
You can let your friend come too
'Cuz I picture your friend on you (Yup)
Smokin' killa Indo, got it from my kinfolk
Haters what you made for, 'cuz you know you dead broke
What they let you in for, shawty you a ten though
Won't you hop yo ass up in them Benz doors
'Cuz once you let me touch it, ain't no need for discussion
I'ma have yo body buzzin', like an automatic weapon
I know it's a recession, but I'm making an exception, for yo bad ass
If you want that damn bag, then gon' and grab it
You can have it, just one swipe of this here plastic
Girl I bet you won't be stressin', if you let them panties lessin'
I mean lossein' I'm the truth, and just want you fruits and juices
One more look at your pass, throw the deuces (Yup)

[Chorus]

Stacks on deck, that's on my life
You never wear the same thing twice
If you leave with ya boy tonight
You can have whatever you like
Yeah
And you gon' have the best sex of yo life
Twice, three time, four time
We gon' get it on tonight
You can have whatever you like
Yeah

[Verse 2]

We up on that E&G, some bonified drinker
She gave me that brain, she a hella fine thinker
Thought process is sex em from desk to the sink'er
Body so wet, I got her so wet
I be her supplier, she give me the fire
She never get tired, call her in her Energizer Bunny
Funny ride, I got my money right
You can tell what I'm doing, by the tires on my ride
Stretch out so wide, them 26's
Ya'll dudes listen, I'm screw pimpin'
Ya'll sto-pigeons, somethin' like when I'm on stool shittin'
Let me tell you what, ya'll dudes missin'
A bit of my style, a bit of my flow, a bit of my smile, a bit of my clothes
Maybe just a bit of my dough
Any time you want to, pick up the telephone to
Call me to your house, show you what I'm 'bout
I'll be so oblige, now hop up in my ride
With them gold packs, know that's extra L size

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

Tell me what you like, I got it
Tell me what you need, I got it
Tell me what you want, I got it
Tell me what it be, I got it
Supersize, like some fries
Like McDonalds, my big Ronald will make you roll yo eyes back
Tell me can you buy that, tell me can you ride that
Once I get inside, Imma glide like a slide at Water World
You the girl, and I'm the man
So understand

[Chorus]
