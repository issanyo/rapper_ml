[Verse 1]
She giving me the side eye
Saying she ain't staying over here
Each and every time I let her down
Like I didn't care

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I got used to hearing whatever I wanted to hear
I guess I got used to feeling, like you supposed to give it here
She said she thought I was different, but now she could see it clear
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this

[Chorus]
You ain't shit, you ain't shit
You ain't shit
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this
You ain't shit

[Verse 2]
Guess she don't want me to hit her up no more
Guess she don't want me to beat it down no more
Maybe she's right when she's like, there's plenty girls I can call
Boy, ain't you tired of this life, don't you ever get bored?

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I got used to hearing whatever I wanted to hear
Guess I got used to feeling, like you supposed to give it here
She said she thought I was different, but now she could see it clear
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon say nothing, but this

[Chorus]
You ain't shit, that's what she said to me
Looked me dead in the eyes and said, "You ain't shit"
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this
"You ain't shit"

[Bridge]
Half the man that you think you are, no you ain't
Nothing like all the songs you sing, I hope you change
No better than my ex, other than the sex that I'm never will forget but it's on to the next
And I know you gonna regret when I'm gone, nigga yes, you ain't even took me shopping yet
Hold up, you saying I ain't shit?
Would you even be here with me here, yeah, if I wasn't rich?
We can talk about your ex 'cause you was cheating on him with me
And we can talk about the sex 'cause that's all it'll ever be
And youâ€™re no little angel girl are you?
You're not a good girl, but you try hard to be
Said she ain't got nothing good to say
So she ain't gon' say nothing, but this

[Chorus]
You ain't shit, that's what she said to me
You ain't shit, that's what she said to me, you ain't shit
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this
You ain't shit, you ain't shit

[Verse 4]
That's how you feel?
Damn, no it's cool, you know
It's too late for all this bullshit
You come here and you know what time it is and now you get all emotional
Now you know you've been drinking
What are you thinking?
Hey don't you hop behind that wheel girl, not tonight
You shouldn't drive, you drunk
I won't tell no lies, girl, you hurt my pride
You know you gotta give me them keys, come back inside
It ain't even that deep, why you tripping on me?
We can take it back a couple of weeks, you was just a homie
What's your problem? I check up, I check up, I check up on you like a doctor
We roll up, we smoke up, we roll up, we smoke up like rastas
And I keep you buzzing, you bussing, you bussing like 'blaka'
You switching it up, came here to fuck, tell me now who's the imposter?
I see how your feelings got involved
Forgot that I was supposed to run when you called
Lay down on the bed and take it off
I break you off, problem solved
Do it quick, baby strip
I get you wet as you can get, I make it drip
Won't you gon' show me who's it is?
Won't you gon' show me you the shit?
Crawled up in it, I'm all up in it
When I fall up in it now I got you screaming "you the shit"
You the shit, you the shit, you the shit
I'm a beast, I'm a freak, she was mad at a nigga
Now she glad that a nigga got her legs in the air like this
You the shit, you the shit, you the shit
You the shit, you the shit, you the shit, you the shit
You the shit, you the shit, you the shit, you the shit
