[Verse 1]
Guess who just got the foreign coupe
Flick the wrist, call it Campbell's soup
You said that Presi Rollie look extra cute
One for me baby, one for you

[Hook]
Guess who got all that
We spent the whole day shoppin' 'cause today's your day
Guess who got all that
And then I'ma take you out, give 'em somethin' else to hate about
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
Guess who got all that
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
Guess who got all that
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
Guess who got all that

[Verse 2]
Guess who went down in Saint Laurent
Daddy bought all the things you want
Brand new Hublot, the 305
Rock it down on Rodeo Drive

[Hook]
Guess who got all that
We spent the whole day shoppin' 'cause today's your day
Guess who got all that
And then I'ma take you out, give 'em somethin' else to hate about
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
Guess who got all that
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
Guess who got all that
I done bought my baby all this new shit just to get the hoes mad
Guess who got all that
