[Intro]
It's 3AM, I'm back for more, yeah
Just two of us
Show me what I'm waiting for
One by one, one by one

[Verse 1]
I saw, I waited
I took time, yeah, I spend it
First time, in a minute
That I worked this hard, that I worked this hard
Thank God, that I did it
One time and I was in it, yeah
But one time ain't enough
I need some more

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there ain't nothing better than you
Got me watching every move
Like you're the only one in the room
Ooh, baby, I can't help myself
And I don't know why but I can't stop thinking
'Bout late last night, when you put it down
Had to turn around and

[Chorus]
Now it's 3AM, I'm back for more, yeah
Just two of us
Show me what I'm waiting for
One by one, one by one, o-one
It's 3AM, I'm back for more
Just two of us
Sets of clothes fall to the floor
One by one, one by one
O-one by one, we're switching up positions
O-one by one, girl, show me what I'm missing

[Verse 2]
I saw, I waited
I took time, yeah, I spend it
First time, in a minute
That I worked this hard, that I worked this hard
Thank God, that I did it
One time and I was in it, yeah
But one time ain't enough
I need some more

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there ain't nothing better than you
Got me watching every move
Like you're the only one in the room
Ooh, baby, I can't help myself
And I don't know why but I can't stop thinking
'Bout late last night, when you put it down
Had to turn around and

[Chorus]
Now it's 3AM, I'm back for more, yeah
(I'm back, I'm back for more)
Just two of us
Show me what I'm waiting for
One by one, one by one (o-one)
It's 3AM, I'm back for more (ooh)
Just two of us
Sets of clothes fall to the floor
One by one, one by one
O-one by one, we're switching up positions
O-one by one, girl, show me what I'm missing

[Bridge]
Ooh, baby, you sexy
Ooh, tell me you ready
Girl, you got that sauce, that sauce
Let me get that spaghetti
Ooh, baby, you fine
Ooh, one more time, yeah
I done hit it once right, home run, fuck her friend zone
Hit it once, twice, now I'm back at it again

[Chorus]
It's 3AM, I'm back for more, yeah
(I'm back, I'm back for more)
Just two of us
Show me what I'm waiting for (know that you're mine)
Number one, number one (o-one)
It's 3AM, I'm back for more (ooh)
Just two of us
Sets of clothes fall to the floor
One by one, one by one
O-one by one, we're switching up positions
O-one by one, girl, show me what I'm missing

[Outro]
Ooh, baby, you fine (one by one, girl, show me what I'm missing)
One by one, girl, show me what I'm missing (ooh, I'm on time, yeah)
One by one, one by one, girl, show me what I'm missing
One by one, one by one
