[Intro]
Songz
It's Songbook, baby
Oh, oh, oh, whoo
Ride, ride, come and ride with the Prince
Come ride, ride, ride, ride with the Prince
Come ride, come ride, come ride
Uh, let's go

[Verse 1]
Friday night, and I'm home just chilling on the sofa
Relaxing, I'm so glad the week is over
I got my remote, good sack of that green, I'ma lean and smoke
Going through my cell for the number of a chick that I met last week and her body ain't no joke
She picked up on the first ring "What took you so long to call me?
Recognized your name and number from the caller ID"
She said her roommate is gone and she all alone
Let me get your street address, let me get dressed, and hung up the phone and it's on

[Pre-Chorus]
She want it and I want it too but I'm unprepared
And we came so close to going raw dog that we both got scared
And she said, "I ain't ready to have no babies," jumped up put my clothes back on
I was just about to get some, had to make a store run

[Chorus]
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run

[Verse 2]
Speeding, switching lanes, and I'm flying
And I'm trying to get back to her before she changes her mind
'Cause if I take too long
She might put her clothes back on
Henny in my system, she tipsy on that Grey Goose
It's obvious what she's tryna get into
Top hugging them curves, got a nigga like me at a loss for words
I know she can tell that I'm with it, wanna get it, while it's H-O-T, she can tell when I'm close to her
She keep licking her lips, she touching and she grabbing
Oh, I'ma throw her the bone, I'ma give it to her all night long
I want it bad, oh so bad
But I know that it's wrong, here we go

[Pre-Chorus]
She want it and I want it too but I'm unprepared
And we came so close to going raw dog that we both got scared
And she said, "I ain't ready to have no babies," jumped up put my clothes back on
I was just about to get some, had to make a store run

[Chorus]
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run

[Bridge]
All I could do is think of being inside you
I'm driving like I'm up out of my mind
Baby, here I come
And you can take your clothes back off

[Chorus]
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run
Store run, pack of three up at the counter
Store run, be back in less than half an hour
Store run, I need protection and I'm out
Wait for me, keep it warm, I had to make a store run

[Outro]
I know, I know, shoulda thought of this before
But who would've thought that we'd end up right on the kitchen floor?
I ain't ready to have no babies, no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes
I'm tryna keep it safe, girl, ain't you heard of AIDS?
