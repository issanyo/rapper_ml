[Verse]
Would you mind if I speak to my lady for a minute?
Woah I been yearning to hold your body close to mine tonight
Is that alright? I been missing you and your love
Your smile, your touch, girl
Look into your eyes and see the sun rise
So beautiful to me
You know what I'd like to see
Won't you put it on for me, put it on?
Won't you put it on for me, put it on?
Baby put it on, put it on
Baby put it on, put it on
Ooh, put it on on me
Please get your lips
Ready for me
For me, for me, for me
