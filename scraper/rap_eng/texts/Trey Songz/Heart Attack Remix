[Intro]
Woop ! (Turn the lights on)
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (x2)

[Verse 1] J. Cole
Now I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet, but that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter, probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rocking with the best mane, dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed mane, let you play with the stick - Ovechkin
She calling, she texting, she’s falling, but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate girl cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming offa my last name cause I really can’t take no stressing
'bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy”
But I’m signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 2]
We share something so common, but still so rare
And I’m in awe, never been here before
So high, we’re still climbing
Even here inside these walls, breaking each others hearts
And we don’t care cause we’re so

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 3] Ludacris
And I'm not from Texas but I hold 'em, rope 'em, and I yoke they neck
You gon make a player choose, show me what that thang'll do
Class is in session, let me show you a thang or two
I'll strip ya, I'll strip ya down to your bare minimums
And I'll, I'll lick ya, I'll lick ya down, you taste like cinnamon
And I'll grab a little bit of that whip cream
Then I'll put her on the back, get mean
Then I'll get her in a matrix, cut her like lasik
Basically make her scream
At the top f her lungs, give her shortness of breath
How many times can you cum before I poke you to death
Someone call in the ref', Ludacris is tired of playin
In the middle of the stage with an ass like that, you got everybody sayin

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 4]
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even tho' I fell way

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 5]
And it hurts, cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even tho' I fell way

[Hook]
Into deep can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh Ohhh wo-oh (Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Ne-Never knew love)
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
