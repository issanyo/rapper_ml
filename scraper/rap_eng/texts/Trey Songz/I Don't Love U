[Verse 1:]
Baby we were like flowers to water
No better yet coke to a snorter,we were like
Martin and Gina,never let nothing come between us
See baby were like a dream,dream of a land far away,away
Had to go and throw it all away,I hope it was worth it
Through with the hurting,girl its for certain..

[Chorus:]
Baby its sad to say,I know that it was you that
Made me feel this way,never thought it'd be a day that I
I don't love you anymore,baby its a shame to see,that being without
You ain't a thing to me,never thought it'd come a day that I,I don't
Love you anymore

[Verse 2:]
I never thought that tis would be,a one true fantasy,turned to a
Tragedy,but all in reality,it was you to be the cause of my doom
Yeah,sicne that day I changed the game,thoughts of you done left
My brain,girl I just don't love you anymore,no

[Chorus x2:]
Baby its sad to say,I know that it was you that
Made me feel this way,never thought it'd be a day that I
I don't love you anymore,baby its a shame to see,that being without
You ain't a thing to me,never thought it'd come a time that I,I don't
Love you anymore

[Bridge:]
See baby we were like a dream,when you threw it away
Oh yeah,huh and girl I just don't love you anymore,all I can say

[Chorus x2:]
Baby its sad to say,I know that it was you that
Made me feel this way,never thought it'd be a day that I
I don't love you anymore,baby it's a shame to see,that being without
You ain't a thing to me,never thought it'd come a time that I ,I don't
Love you anymore
