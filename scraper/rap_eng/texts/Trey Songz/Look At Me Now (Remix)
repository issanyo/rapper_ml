[Intro]
Whoaa
Bitch you know my name
Leggo
It's Mr. Tremaine

[Verse]
Ladies love me, here go that new Trey
Kiss and suck me, I call it toupee
I got on Breezy shit, give my shit a break
Fuck am I talking bout? Aye peedis get my spins up
Love faces, Bottoms up
Came straight from the bottom up
Who you gon' find at the top of the charts that hot as fuck and these broads'll fuck?
Ya'll niggas pick my garbage up
Say my prayers, in god we trust
Know I gotta lot of money so these niggas acting funny
Gotta turn the Cadillac into an armor truck
Bitch nigga on the arm of her
So I look her in her eye, start charming her
Wanna know you very well, pretty skin caramel and a nigga tryna bust that almond nut
Chi-Town freak hoes, cold as a bitch though
Came in a trench coat, took it off, beach clothes
Get naked, right this second
Girl you ain't nothing but a bird, just peck it
Watch full of carrots with a pocket full of lettuce
While you hating niggas ride 87 and alet it
I hope your shit break down, look at a nigga now

[Hook]
Look at me now (x3)
I'm getting paper

[Verse 2]
VA I did it for ya'll
But the two audemars I did it to ball
High school couldn't keep me out the halls
Pretty bitch couldn't keep me out her draws
Shitting on ya'll, treat the game like a star
Drown in the water while you hang from my balls
My clothes don't hang in the mall
This shit fresh off from the plane from Milan
Good head, can't name the salon
But I swear I just came in her mind
Gotta her hiding in a plane in the morning
Gave her two pills, don't blame me I'm wrong
Why the fuck they let me on this song?
I don't even care who own this song
Chris could've called me, man you should've called me
Man, god damn I love this song
Let's talk about the way I got on this John
We was in the garage and I got on that bong
A nigga said Wayne went nuts and I think I went, what my nuts are over-grown
I'm so high, I'm overblown
Think I'm overdosing on
My ego, I'm so lethal
There's no equal, I'm so evil, No Knievel
But I stunt hard, my front yard - got horses
Think that porches from midevil
There's no way this can be legal
200 while I'm blunted
And her mouth just keep on running
Cause the weave they've just done and
So I told the bitch to bun it
?
Murder the shit like Black Ops
Flap jackers and ?
In this one year, I made more
Than the whole existence of yours
Nigga, just got my voice insured
Yeah, look at me now, bitch

[Hook]
Look at me now (x3)
I'm getting paper
Look at me now (x3)
Yeah, look at me now, bitch
