[Intro]
Oh, yeah
No, yeah, ow

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby girl, I left a piece of my heart
In New York, in New York, in L.A, in L.A
Baby ‘cause I left a piece of my heart
In Paris, in Paris, in London

[Chorus]
I’ve made love, love around the world
Love around the world, love around the world
I’ve made love, love around the world
Love around the world, with one too many girls

[Verse 1]
I can’t expect to give my heart, give my mind, give me soul
Give you my everything when I already gave it to her, no
I can’t expect to give my heart, give my mind, give me soul
Give you my everything when I already gave it to her, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby girl, I left a piece of my heart
In New York, in New York, in L.A, in L.A
Baby ‘cause I left a piece of my heart
In Paris, in Paris, in London

[Chorus]
I’ve made love, love around the world
Love around the world, love around the world
I’ve made love, love around the world
Love around the world, with one too many girls

[Verse 2]
We’re not touched down, take off to your city
Checking the hotel, better be on your way like ooh
She love me so, give it all to me before I go
Girl, I’m just letting you know, I've made love

[Chorus]
I’ve made love, love around the world
Love around the world, love around the world
I’ve made love, love around the world
Love around the world, with one too many girls

[Bridge]
I can’t expect to give my heart, give my mind, give me soul
Give you my everything when I already gave it to her, no
I can’t expect to give my heart, give my mind, give me soul
Give you my everything when I already gave it to her, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby girl, I left a piece of my heart
In New York, in New York, in L.A, in L.A
Baby ‘cause I left a piece of my heart
In Paris, in Paris, in London

[Chorus]
I’ve made love, love around the world
Love around the world, love around the world
I’ve made love, love around the world
Love around the world, with one too many girls
