[Chorus]
But I gotta go right now
I don't wanna leave
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back before you know it

[Verse]
Goodbyes are so hard
Before I go, I just wanna thank those that got me here
First and foremost, I wanna thank the Lord
Jesus Christ, for allowing me the chance to let y'all know he's real
Songbook baby
My man Troy Taylor, I love you nigga
Disha, Quincy, go Sooners
To my man Delante "Butta" Murphy, what up D?
D2 music management putting it down
Yeah, we here, man crazy
To Mike Caren to bringing me to the world
To Craig Calmen and Ron Shipero for believing in Mike Caren
My nigga Henry Singleton y'all
Keeping that 25th floor rocking or 28th
Ronny Johnson, Mo, James Lopez, Ambush
Sharon, Sidney, Barry Wood, Eric Fords to Earle
Crystal, Kushna, Johnathon Lennard, Wez West
Mama West, what's happening?
Andrew, Mark for getting that paper right
Bob Bracey for getting that paper right
G, hip-hop, Al, Paul, Linda, Patty
To all the assistants for doing their thing, na mean?
Man read the credits for all the rest
I gotta go
Last but not least, my folks
Mama, I love you baby
I'm here
What up Forest? Take care of my mama while I'm gone
I gotta go
Gimme kiss Rose
Del, Fi, Auntie Leesha, Aunt Marian
All my niggas, Jay, Ray, Coop, Quest, Finch
Y'all my heart man
Petersburg, VA

[Chorus]
I don't wanna leave
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back before you know it
