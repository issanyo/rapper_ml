[talking:]
I'm tryna put it into words
It's like... it's like
Check it out, right
My ol' lady, right
You know, my girl
Take something simple like eating soup
I crack, I crack the crackers up in the soup
I crack them up, you know what I mean
They're like...
She likes her crackers dissolved in the soup
(hehe) she's so cute
She light up my life, mayne
She does, believe her

[Verse 1:]
I ain't tryna say nothing u ain't tryna hear
Relax your mind, have no fear
Cause I'm about to show you, yeahh
Shawty got love
I got love
She's the only one I'm thinking of
Someone to hold close

[Bridge:]
See, it's a fear for finding a way, girl
I ain't tryna be alone, no way girl
See you're the destiny in me, babe
I don't need no one else, babe
See, it's the fear for finding a way, girl
I ain't tryna be in nobody else's world
I got a lot of love so I give it all to you

[Chorus:]
Won't you call this your love song
Not just a cut song
I'm a lean to the side
One hand up
One finger up, girl
This is my love
Call this your love song
Not just a cut song
So if you feel me then
Put your hands up, hands up
Girl, this is my love
I ain't tryna say nothing u ain't tryna hear
Relax your mind, have no fear
Cause I'm about to show you, yeahh
Shawty got love
I got love
She's the only one I'm thinking of
Someone to hold close

[Verse 2:]
You told me
Keep your name off the press
So I gotta hold it in
Not say you the best
Yes, you're the opposite of stress
A whole lot more but you're damn showing nothing less
So tell me what's next
We headed to the crib just to have a little sex (make love)
Yes, there ain't no tests but your carats on your neck
Make your body feel timeless
It ain't nothing to it
Just like a door
Girl, you gotta walk through it, yeah
I'll show you I'm the truest
Girl To You, For Me

[Chorus:]
Won't you call this your love song
Not just a cut song
And I'm a lean to the side
One hand up
One finger up, girl
This is my love
Call this your love song
Not just a cut song
So if you feel me then
Put your hands up, hands up
Girl, this is my love

[Bridge:]
See, it's a fear for finding a way, girl
I ain't tryna be alone, no way girl
See you're the destiny in me, babe
I don't need no one else, babe
See, it's the fear for finding a way, girl
I ain't tryna be in nobody else's world
I got a lot of love so I give it all to you

[Chorus:]
Won't you call this your love song
Not just a cut song
And I'm a lean to the side
One hand up
One finger up, girl
This is my love
Call this your love song
Not just a cut song
So if you feel me then
Put your hands up, hands up
Girl, this is my love
Call this your love song
Not just a cut song
And I'm a lean to the side
One hand up
One finger up, girl
This is my love
Call this your love song
Not just a cut song
So if you feel me then
Put your hands up, hands up
Girl, this is my love
