[Verse 1]
High heels on, hair did
Can't no other woman rock a dress like this
Body bangs, doing her thang
She the only reason for the song I sing
And I wish I could be there when she get ready to go
Dancing in the mirror and talking on the phone
Telling all the home girls what she putting on
They already know she putting on

[Chorus]
'Cause when she hit the club, heads turn around
She living it up, drinks up in the club
I'm in love from afar
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Girl, I wanna be where you are

[Verse 2]
Should I make a move or should I fall back
Let you do what you do
See in you in the song, I ain't tryna kill the groove
Know you turning down all them other dudes
But I ain't nothing like them, no can't fight the feeling
Girl, I wanna know about you, yeah
Baby, don't you get me wrong, no
But I've been watching you so long

[Chorus]
'Cause when she hit the club, heads turn around
She living it up, drinks up in the club
I'm in love from afar
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Girl, I wanna be where you are

[Bridge]
Are you here from one of my dreams?
'Cause I don't want to ruin this fantasy
To take the chance
And you don't wanna be mine
But you gotta be in my heart
Girl, I'm coming over to you
I'll put my pride to the side
But I wanna leave with all your love

[Chorus]
Be where you are
I just wanna be here
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Please don't deny me
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be
'Cause when she hit the club, heads turn around
She living it up, drinks up in the club
I'm in love from afar
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Baby girl, I wanna be where you are
Be where you are
Where you are, where you are
Girl, I wanna be where you are

[Outro]
Oh, oh, I'll go where you go
I wanna be where you are
Wherever you go
I will go there
Girl, I'm prepared
I'll go, I want your love
Baby, I'll go
It's all I think of
