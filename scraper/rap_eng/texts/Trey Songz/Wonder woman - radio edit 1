TREY SONGZ
I gave you prophesy on my first joint
But you all lamed out
It ain't really appreciated
The second one's out
Danger! Songs!

Your face is amazing, blazing, hot like Cajun; and all I need is a minute
Please, no gimmicks; ya tellin' me to chill
On the real, or take a trip to Satan
Sent me to hell wit' it
Then I yelled wit' it
Dude, the hell wit' ya crew
Say you got a man; well, the hell wit' him too
The seats is seashell, the whip is sea blue
And you can swim through
Ain't a lot of women that I can't swim through
And you can't say that I don't tempt you
'Cause if you said that, you's a liar
Grip them legs back, call me pliers
Z-4 chrome up under the tires
And you so grown, and my desires
To make you come
Finish that rum
Aye, who said Trey Songz ain't fire?

[Chorus:]
The way you talkin', girl, you seem so invincible
It's more than, sexy girl, the way that you take control
I wonder, woman, are you my kinda woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman?

It's a shame the way you do your thing
You can't blame me staring at your frame
What's your name?
Baby, they call me Trey
From the TV to the stage
The pr-pr-prince of VA

I got poppas like doctors
I can change your life
You should stop watching and jockin' as if you ain't gon' ride
I wonder somethin', baby
We gon' do somethin' tonight, tonight, oh

The way you talkin', girl, you seem so invincible
It's more than, sexy girl, the way that you take control
I wonder, woman, are you my kinda woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Shawty)
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman?

What's this game, baby, I wanna play?
What you say can't let you get away
'Cause I don't wanna leave, girl
I only wanna be with you, with you

I got poppas like doctors
I can change your life
You should stop watching and jockin' as if you ain't gon' ride
I wonder somethin', baby
We gon' do somethin' tonight, tonight, oh

[Chorus]
I wonder 'cause I need a special kinda woman beside me
You my Wonder Woman; come find me
We can do whatever, woman, 'long as we together, woman
This ain't a game (no)
I need a super kinda woman beside me
Girl, I need a miracle
Anything is possible
Make your body be my home
Let me come inside, and we gon' see if you invincible

The way you talkin', girl, you seem so invincible
It's more than, sexy girl, the way that you take control
I wonder, woman, are you my kinda woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman, shawty?

The way you talking, girl, you seem so invincible
The way that you take control
I wonder, woman
Are you my kinda woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman?

If we could be super friends in your world
It'd be so incredible
I can't help but wonder 'cause
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman?
