[Intro]
Only if I could

[Verse 1]
Money on my mind, so these haters in the way
Having conversations with that paper every day
I ain’t talking short bread, girl I'm with that major K
Plus I spend it, I can’t take it when the Lord take me away
With my lighter, with my lighter, hey Sissi, fill my drink up
Ain’t no purple, ain’t no pink up in this red cup but I’m fucked up
Staring at your body, God damn your sexy body
I’m Trey, I came to play and I wanna use you as my hobby, girl
Seen so many faces in these unfamiliar cities
Bright skylines got a nigga kinda dizzy
They tryna take my spot well they gon' have to come and get me
My crib is at the top, ain't nobody rolling with we

[Chorus]
If I could, I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me
Here's my world, for free, I'm tryna give you what you came to see, yeah
If I could, I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me
Here's my world, for free, I'm tryna give you what you came to see, yeah

[Verse 2]
You say you’re working harder, then I swear that you’re a liar
They swear they hot as me, but they ain't never felt the fire
And if you’re talking money, boy you preaching to the choir
And I be in her brain, she can’t think of nothing flyer
For my niggas in the hood, looking at these other niggas like, "I wish a nigga would"
'Cause it ain’t all good, if I could I would, reach out my hands
To everybody that’s suffering, push you down, get up again
Play by my rules, so fuck the plan, it's
Money on my mind, so these haters in the way
Having conversations with that paper every day
I ain’t talking short bread, girl I'm with that major K
Plus I spend it, I can’t take it when the Lord take me away

[Chorus]
If I could, if I could, I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me
Here's my world, for free, I'm tryna give you what you came to see, yeah
If I could, I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me
Here's my world, for free, I'm tryna give you what you came to see, yeah

[Verse 3]
Lately I'm smokin' more
Yeah, do it for Virginia, every time
Yeah, lately I’m smokin' more, but still I’m focused more
I live today 'cause see, tomorrow, I don’t know for sure
You who I wrote this for, oh yeah, you dope for sure
Oh yeah, you’re raw, so get it cookin', let ‘em know you pure
I prayed for this, so I’m made for this
These niggas just pot holes in the road that I paved for this
Obama tryna turn this motherfucker 'round
And look, they’re tryna put that motherfucker down
Women, please check for somethin' more than stilettos
And young girls, make these little niggas respect you
If I was your father, I’d never neglect you
So a nigga like me probably never had met you
Probably somethin' special, and I’m happy I met you
But you really wanna know me, I just wanna sex you
After you wanna cuddle, I don’t want, but I let you
You made me promise, and I’m honest, try not to forget you
Bond growin' stronger with the brothers that look up to me
It’s more important than whatever that they fuck with me
Luckily my angel speak to God, like what’s up for me
My heart beat for the people who carry the love for me
Left my feelings in the past, you can’t get in touch with me
If he want it, I give 'em cash, I do it reluctantly
But that’s my nigga, I’ma put him back up on his feet
And if he fall, he can still come right back to me

[Outro]
Wish I could take everybody, nigga, on top of the world
Everybody can’t go though, I try my best, if I could then I would
Everybody can’t go, give you what you came to see, yeah
I’ma take who I can, only if I could
