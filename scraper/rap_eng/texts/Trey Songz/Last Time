This is the last time, I know I'm 'bout to drive you crazy
Last time, but I gotta see my baby
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more
Try to walk, but I just can't leave her alone, girl
She keep callin' me, callin' me, I try to leave her alone but
She keep callin' me, callin' me and I gotta go

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Damn, here we go again
I just came back, girl, don't make me go again
She say you been in the streets, you was with that hoe again
Money wrapped in rubber bands, what you sellin' blow again?
How she got you holdin' guns but you call that hoe your friend?
You ain't 'posed to bring her home, what do you, you show her in?
I was like show her in, never that, oh no
Anybody in the streets know that that's a no, no
So no, I would never ever, ever, ever
Baby, I'm a G, yeah, that's right the seventh letter
See one thing about the streets, I know where the heifer at
And I bet she always be exactly where I left her at
But you know we had a bond, no ring, no paper
And I don't hear this shit when I bring home paper
My ears to the streets, what you gon' tell us?
You keep talkin' down, girl, you sound like you jealous

This is the last time, I know I'm 'bout to drive you crazy
Last time, but I gotta see my baby
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more
Try to walk, but I just can't leave her alone, girl
She keep callin' me, callin' me, I try to leave her alone but
She keep callin' me, callin' me and I gotta go

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Hi honey, I'm home
She looked at me and said it's five somethin' in the morn'
You smell like you been drinkin', the vibe from me this strong
I said, baby, that's cologne, she said, nigga, that's Patron
If you wanna keep with them bad habits, that's fine
You think I'm with it then you out your rabid ass mind
They'll say tricks are for kids, most chicks woulda slid
But who ain't miss a visit through the six that you did
I'll be damned if I do another six with some kids
Who only see they daddy in them flicks on the fridge
Them niggas that you think are in a mix with ya shit
They the same reason Michael Vick's doin' bids
I say hol' up, I met you, I was thuggin' back then
And you was ridin' with me holdin' on a Mack 10
But that was back when you ain't give a what
Now you standin' here tellin' me to give her up

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This is the last time, I know I'm 'bout to drive you crazy
Last time, but I gotta see my baby
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more
Try to walk, but I just can't leave her alone, girl
She keep callin' me, callin' me, I try to leave her alone but
She keep callin' me, callin' me and I gotta go

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Hold on, baby please
You can't leave now, no, John baby, please
We gonna get you to a hospital, as quickly as possible
Life is full of obstacles, we gon' get you through this one
You looked me in my eye when you told me you was done
I played her for a fool but I guess I was the foolish one
'Member when she told me that she know how this dream ends
Late night phone call from one of my close friends
Tellin' you that we are, rushin' to the ER
By this time tomorrow we was posed to be in DR
Me blowin' a cigar, you sippin' a 'tini
I told her pack her bags and don't forget her bikini
Then just like Houdini, it all disappeared
The escape to paradise, didn't end like this I swear
Sorry baby girl, I tried the best I could
If I can't be in the streets I guess Heaven's just as good

She keep callin' me, callin' me, I try to leave her alone but
She keep callin' me, callin' me and I gotta go
Said I gotta go, she keep callin' me, callin' me
