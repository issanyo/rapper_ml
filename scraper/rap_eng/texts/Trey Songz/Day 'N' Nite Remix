[Verse 1]
Tell me what's happening, I'm addicted to plastering these rappers beats with my vocals
What happens when I'm ask to sing
No problem on instrumentals, I guess they ask for me
Then I answer, give em' cancer and they come back for me
So why they mad at me? Cause my mental capacity
Get to over lapping them bastards, the audacity
Haters even clap for me, realizing actually
I represent the betterment and they just late like letterman, man
Trey Songz, page long list of who I'm better than
Contact my d-a-zon, I might need excedrin
Sicker than I ever been, they want me instead of em'
And if they dislike it, I'm letting them, so let em' in (Come on)
Guess I'm 'spose to let em' win, if you was to bet again
It be best if you would just put paper on (the medicine)
I'll let you know, I walk all through your vestibule
I guess you know I'll stretch your ho, her love drip on my testacles
T.M.I. but he is I and I am him
Flyer then propellers you so jealous, you can tell us just e-mail us
I'm a problem no you's hatin', there ain't no calculating
I'm so nasty on the beat just like a freak that's masturbating
Be making fashion statements when I leave my place of residence
Feel like I'm intelligent and everybody's hella' dense
Irrelevant and the only exception is my relevance
You looking at the future if ever I'm in ya' presence shit
Hated right, Trey be like, "haters get ya' paper right"
Swear you fly, telling lies
Couldn't live a faker life
They love it, shout out to Kid Cudi
I like to live lovely in your city, something pretty
Why the kids call you ugly? Man I'm bugging', I be trippin'
I be playin' but they listen
I'm saying what the business
What you missing, I'm the illest
I do this in my free time, man you can search but you will never find a weak line
