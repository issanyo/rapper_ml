[Intro]
You looking too good
What you standing over there by yourself for?
(Won't you come over here? Huh?)
I think it's time we take a trip, tell me where
Tell me where you wanna go (You wanna go)
I got an idea (What you think about this?)
(Just follow me baby, I'll take you where you need to be)

[Verse 1]
Girl, you know that you the shh, way you walking with them heels on
Talking to me dirty, your body I wanna feel on, feel on, feel on, feel on
Once I get to you I promise we gon' go re-real long, real long, real long, real long, real long
Girl, I do you right
Don't you know that you the shh, got me turnin' off my cell phone
Nothing's more important than getting our fairytale on, tale on
Your hair long, hair long, I just wanna pull it
Baby, wait a minute, don't be timid
Don't be shy, you so fly, I just wanna take you on a ride

[Chorus x2]
I think it's time we take a trip to the bed
Girl, your body's talking and I'm loving what she said
Don't you be afraid to let me elevate you
Welcome you to super, duper, jupiter love

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know that you the shh, ain't nobody gotta tell ya
Natural body fragrance is such a sweet aroma
Oh how I love being inside your love
You lookin' too good for me not jump all over you
So good, that's exactly what I wanna do
Let me hold your heart, show me where to start
It's amazing how you shine in the dark

[Chorus x2]
I think it's time we take a trip to the bed (Can we go there?)
Girl your body's talking and I'm loving what she said
Don't you be afraid to let me elevate you
Welcome you to super, duper, jupiter love

[Bridge]
Ooh, now that we are here, the stars are all aligned
It's unbelievable, so incredible
Give me your love
You love, welcome to super, duper, jupiter love

[Chorus x3]
I think it's time we take a trip to the bed
Girl your body's talking and I'm loving what she said
Don't you be afraid to let me elevate you
Welcome you to super, duper, jupiter love
