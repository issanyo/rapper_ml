[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, Song, oh
Songz is my name, yup

[Chorus]
Shawty brand new, brand new, fresh out the box, fresh out the box
I think she came here with her girlfriend
Shawty brand new, brand new, fresh out the box, fresh out the box
Tonight I'm gon' be your husband

[Verse 1]
Soon as girl, step up in the club
All the fellas trying hard to say what's up
But, me I play it cool, just like chess, I know the rules
And, I bet I checkmate her in like 4 moves
I'ma say, "Girl, what'cha drinkin' on?" 'Trone
And she drink it straight 'cause she like it strong
Look girl, I wanna leave with you so we can get it on
Is this is the last call and this is the last song

[Chorus]
She said boy, I'm brand new, brand new, fresh out the box, fresh out the box
Yeah, I came here with my girlfriend
She said she brand new, brand new, fresh out the box, fresh out the box
Tonight I'm gon' be her husband
So let's just tear our clothes off, let's just tear our clothes off
She sipping on that liquor, I'm tryna get her to the house
Girl, let's just tear our clothes off, let's just tear our clothes off
She said she brand new, I'm tryna see what that's about

[Verse 2]
She said she ain't even looking for a dude
But, if you with a winner then you know you can't lose
And it's all red on the bottom of ya shoes
So, I already know you gotta have loot
Ain't got a lot of time, so I won't spend it talking like these lame niggas
Paper that they ain't spending, can you dig it, girl?
I wanna leave with you so we can get it on
Is this is the last call and this is the last song

[Chorus]
She said boy, I'm brand new, brand new, fresh out the box, fresh out the box
Yeah, I came here with my girlfriend
She said she brand new, brand new, fresh out the box, fresh out the box
Tonight I'm gon' be her husband
So let's just tear our clothes off, let's just tear our clothes off
She sipping on that liquor, I'm tryna get her to the house
Girl, let's just tear our clothes off, let's just tear our clothes off
She said she brand new, I'm tryna see what that's about

[Bridge]
She said she ain't tryna be no one night creep
But, you ain't never had one night with me
Come ride with me, girl, you gon' see
There's no place else you'd rather be
Nothing else I'd rather see
Eyes on you, what you gon' do?
So brand new, you know what I wanna do
Open you up
So let's just tear our clothes off, let's just tear our clothes off
Let's girl, let's just, let's just, let's just tear our clothes off
Girl, let's just tear our clothes off, let's just tear our clothes off
Girl you brand new so let's just tear our clothes off

[Chorus]
She said boy, I'm brand new, brand new, fresh out the box, fresh out the box
Yeah, I came here with my girlfriend
She said she brand new, brand new, fresh out the box, fresh out the box
Tonight I'm gon' be her husband
So let's just tear our clothes off, let's just tear our clothes off
She sipping on that liquor, I'm tryna get her to the house
Girl, let's just tear our clothes off, let's just tear our clothes off
She said she brand new, I'm tryna see what that's about

[Outro]
