Through the nights and the day, see I only want a girl that can give me (Whatever you want)
Work it out I wanna play can I hear you say my name, baby give me (Whatever you want)
All you gotta do is say the word, and it don't matter what you heard
Promise to give you what he don't, and you can have, you can have (Whatever you want)

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Time is of the essence I'm so blessed to have your presence
I promise not to fall short of anything you have accepted
I'll exceed that
Tell me what you want, I'm just dying to eat the feedback
Your body is the truth I wanna lie you down, believe that
My future's in your eyes, can you see that
No place in the world is a fly as wherever we at, yeah
Need a woman with an open mind to go inside and open mine
Show me what she find then in time if we coincide, I'll know my bride
The warmth to my coldest side, her head's to my shoulder side
Even if I never cry, any issue big or petty: know she keep some tissue ready
So roll come and go, only if you ready
For the long haul baby this ain't going steady

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Don't you be alarmed girl
Won't you take my arm girl
I don't mean no harm girl
You the one I want girl
Where I wanna be is wherever you are with me
Pick a special place and we could go there
Just you and me, nobody we know there
You be my audience, give you a show there
We can share moments so rare (yeah)
If you come go with me, I can sure guarantee
That it's gone be (Whatever you want)
You can hold me to that now (You can have, whatever you want)
Whatever you need, yeah (Oooh) (Whatever you want)
I can have it here you know? Whether it's far or near you know?
Nothing's too small. What's your favorite kind of cereal? (Whatever you want)
Girl it's whatever you want, want, want (Whatever you want)

[Hook: Trey Songz & Sasha Gomez]
Through the nights and the day, see I only want a girl that can give me (Is it you?) (Whatever you want)
Work it out I wanna play can I hear you say my name, baby give me (Whatever you want)
All you gotta do is say the word, and it don't matter what you heard (It don't matter girl)
Promise to give you what he don't (And I promise), and you can have, you can have (Whatever you want)

[Sasha Gomez]
Baby you can have whatever you want (Bum bum)

You know you want it let me back it up (Don't run)
You can have whatever you want (Whatever you want)
