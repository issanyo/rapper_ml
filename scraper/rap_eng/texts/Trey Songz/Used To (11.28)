[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sampa, baby

[Verse 1]
You already know it's a wrap when (Wrap)
You hit my phone after three (Three)
Keep sendin' those freaky emojis (Yeah)
Yeah, I know where you wanna be
And it's all for the fix
Know you wanna risk it all for the fix
Pop another Aderrall for the fix
And do things that you don't for the dick
'Cause I can make your body come alive, make it cum a lot, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Make you feel good when I'm inside (Oh, yeah)
You say you've done this before
That ain't shit compared to your boy

[Chorus]
I'm not that nigga that you're used to
Nah, I'm not that nigga that you're used to
Yeah, stroke game on official
Call the referee and blow the whistle (Yeah)
I take it low like it's limbo (Low)
All I really need is your hips tho' (Hips, baby)
Probably take some gettin' used to
Nah, I ain't that nigga you're used to

[Verse 2]
Go from the night to the morning
Talkin' that shit like you want it (Want it)
Just call on me when you want it
I'ma put it down, put it down, I'ma own it
You be goin' hard for the dick
Know you wanna risk it all for the dick
Go and take you clothes off for the dick (Dick)
Do things that you don't for the dick

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can make your body come alive, make it cum a lot, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Make you feel good when I'm inside (Oh, yeah)
You say you've done this before
That ain't shit compared to your boy

[Chorus]
I'm not that nigga that you're used to
Nah, I'm not that nigga that you're used to
Yeah, stroke game on official
Call the referee and blow the whistle (Yeah)
I take it low like it's limbo (Low)
All I really need is your hips tho' (Hips, baby)
Probably take some gettin' used to
'Cause, nah, I ain't that nigga you're used to

[Bridge]
Go from the night to the morning
Talkin' that shit like you want it
Just call on me when you want it
I'ma put it down, put it down, I'ma own it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Baby, bust it, know I love it, keep your head down, yeah
Got you tweakin', body leakin', no it's wet down there
Comin' downstairs, baby got the best head, yeah
Keep your legs spread, don't I got the best head?
Fuckin' up the best bed (With the sheets, sheets)
Got your body, you a jet setter
Eat that pretty pie 'till my face wet, ah
You say, hold you down, so I never let up
Keep you legs up, what

[Outro]
I'm not that nigga that you're used to (Oh, nah)
Nah, I'm not that nigga that you're used to (Oh, nah)
Yeah, stroke game on official (Oh, yeah)
No, I'm not that nigga that you're used to
