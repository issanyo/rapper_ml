[Hook: Trey Songz]
Oh girl you nasty
​Kissing your friend while looking back at it
Best you ever had, shit
Two girls one savage I'm doing damage oh
I know you want it and girl you can have it
If you can manage
Switch places with your friend girl tap out tap in
Having sex with you
Yeah sexing the two of you
Tell you what Imma do
Taste her while I'm hitting you
Imma savage girl this is true
Now is you up for the challenge
I told you already girl I am a savage

[Verse: Jowynalex]
Yeah girl I'm a savage
Yes I like livin' lavish
I don't fuck with bitches that are average, my friend's established
My money long
I lease the final on a shot of patron
Got 'em sayin' that they love my cologne
You wanna have sex with me and Trey Songz
Bitch, tu amiga se sabe la clave
Dicen que no y
Porque nos fuimos de viaje
Asi que prepara tu equipaje
Yo quiero ver todo el paisaje
