[Intro: Trey Songz]
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, yeah

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
She always complainin', she say I'm a player
Cars stupid fast, goodbye to my haters
Ballin' at the gym, now who wanna play us?
Got a bad bitch, Guantanamera
Whoa, Guantanamera
Whoa, Guantanamera
Whoa, Guantanamera
Hey, hey, Guantanamera

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]
Guantanamera, we in Venezuela
I don't know her name but I know where she came from
House so big I can't see my neighbors
I grab 'em and pass 'em, you try to save 'em, yeah
Whoa, Guantanamera
Ridin' Audis through the hood, you know I be skatin'
Tiptoein' in my Jordans soon as I lace 'em
Spent in all at the mall, it was Vuitton she lace 'em
Now I'ma go crazy, now baby, you know that your looks are deceivin'
I tell all these girl that I'm rich and don't need 'em and no one believes me
These niggas be mad, I be catchin' their baby girl lookin' and peeping
Take her home then I beat it 'til she sleepin', sleepin'

[Hook: Sage The Gemini]
She always complainin', she say I'm a player
Cars stupid fast, goodbye to my haters
Ballin' at the gym, now who wanna play us?
Got a bad bitch, Guantanamera
Whoa, Guantanamera
Whoa, Guantanamera
Whoa, Guantanamera
Hey, hey, Guantanamera

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Pull up in a Benz screamin' "Fuck a hater"
And nigga, I done caught your bitch on an elevator
Nigga, I done told your bitch I'ma fuck her later
And she gon' only get this dick, not no fuckin' paper
Vamanos, knock 'em all down like dominoes
Then I tell 'em adios
If you got a bad bitch and she suck a good dick
Better lock her pussy down and you call it Guantanamo
Huh, that pussy tryna run, call that cardio
This gon' be a lot of fun, moon turn to the sun
We gon' get it to tomorrow
Spend a couple car notes on a couple bottles
Yo the rich shit don't end
You don't wanna roll all along, tell your homies come on
And it's on, I'ma hit your friend
Uh, I'm cool with it if you cool with it
If you suck, spit and you drool with it
And I'ma be up in the hole all day
Guantanamo bay, Trey

Whoa, Guantanamera
Whoa, Guantanamera
