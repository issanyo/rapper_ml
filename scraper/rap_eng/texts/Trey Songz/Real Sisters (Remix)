(Hook)
Aye bring you homegirl with the fat butt wit ya
I'm tryna bust a couple nuts with you
First met her, she say they were real sisters
I don't give a fuck if they were twin sisters
I just tryna get ‘em in the benz wit it
She know I fuck with all her friends nigga
First met her, she say they were real sisters
I don’t give a fuck if they were twin sisters


(Verse)
Found out they we’re cousins but we’ve been fuckin’
She told em that she love it, now her friends fuckin'
Why these niggas mad?, Why they mean muggin?
Lookin’ all hard like it mean somethin’
I say trigga you a star, they ain’t seen nothin’
I'm from where throwing jacks and get the fiens jumping
I get the bitches, nigga you know that’s a part from me
I don’t know nothin’ bout the way these other artists be
These niggas talking ‘bout some shit that they never did
My other bitch, she just pull up with some other bitch
Got my other bitch chillin’ at my other crib
Nigga last night don’t remember what I did
Got another phone, got rid of my other phone
Told my stripper girl, baby leave your butt alone
I like my stripper girl, cause she never come alone
She bring her friends, them the ones I spend the money on
I kiss her pussy, baby whay you ackin' funny for?
I'm cumin' witcha, baby I won’t let you to cum alone
I’m fuckin’ witcha sticky, icky in your honey cone
She told her bitch like take that dick, aye what you runnin’ for?

She know I fuck with all her friends nigga
First met her, she say they were real sisters
