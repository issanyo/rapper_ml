[Verse 1]
Girl you held me down how could I forget
You stayed with me when I wasn't shit
Sometimes I can't believe I swear that's crazy
When I wake up everyday I see your face (yeah)
You kept believing in me when I quit (quit)
Tell me go get it boss I'll be right here (here)
I'm ready to put my pride to the side (to the side)
And tell you that I (I, I)
