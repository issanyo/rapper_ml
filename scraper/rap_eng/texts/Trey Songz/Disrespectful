[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
If my girl found out you was on her side of the bed, she'll kill me
If your man found out I was on his side of the bed, he'll go HAM
If my girl found out you was wearing her robe, I'd probably go missing
If your man found out I was wearing his slippers, wait

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
I don't care about none of these niggas, none of these niggas
I don't care about none of these niggas, none of these niggas
I don't care about none of these niggas, none of these niggas
I don't care about nobody but you

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl, you so special
I don't mind being disrespectful
Girl, you so special
We're so disrespectful, oh
Girl, you can call my phone at four in the morning
Girl, you can ride shotgun every time I'm rolling
Girl, you can come with me to her favorite diner
She even took me home so I could meet her mama, disrespectful

[Verse 2: Mila J]
If my man found out you was using his rubbers I'd be dead
If your girl found out you was paying my rent, she would lose her head
If my man found out I was washing your drawers, he'd pull out the desert eagle
If your girl found out how good I was riding that, wait

[Pre-Chorus: Mila J]
I don't care about none of these bitches, none of these bitches
I don't care about none of these bitches, none of these bitches
I don't care about none of these bitches, none of these bitches
I don't care about nobody but you

[Chorus: Mila J]
Boy, you so special
I don't mind being disrespectful
Boy, you so special
We so disrespectful, hey
Boy, you can call my phone at four in the morning
Boy, you can ride shotgun every time I'm rolling
Boy, you can take me out to her favorite diner
I'll even take you home and you can meet my mama, disrespectful

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
I don't mind being a little disrespectful
You've been down for a nigga since I met you
I don't mind being a little disrespectful
Girl, you're special so I'll be disrespectful

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Mila J]
Girl, you so special, you so special baby
I don't mind being disrespectful, girl, I don't mind
Boy, you so special, I don't, I don't mind
We so disrespectful
Girl, you can call my phone at four in the morning, you can call my phone
Boy, you can ride shotgun every time I'm rolling, any time you want
Girl, you can come with me to her favorite diner, take me out to her favorite diner
I'll even take you home so you could meet my mama, so disrespectful
Disrespectful
Disrespectful
