And I'ma make it my duty
To have you so wooosy; you think I invented Ex (yeah)
Some say it ain't nothing new under the sun
You never seen a bitch do what I done
When your soldier's at attention
And my loving is the mission; boy missionary's no good
On my body like you knockin on wood
And if any one of ya'll in here could
{I wish I could} Get Miss Keri babyyy!

[Hook: Keri Hilson] + (Trey)

I mean imagine how I'm sexin, nobody directin
Nobody to cut, only you and me tho
Wanna make your body blast off, torpedo
Forget about the missionary, girl you know we grown

You know the plumber like pipe down (pipe down)
Ready in the stores like right now (right now)

Hit it from the side, show you how to love handle
Got you with the toes curled up, no sandals
