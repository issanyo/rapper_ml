[Verse 1]
And it ain't no game, but your nigga can not play
Nigga never ever, ever say your name, your secret's safe with me
Uh huh yeah, love the way that you ride it
Uh huh yeah, made you my bitch
You was playing for that other nigga
I got you switching sides quick
Yeah, switch it, switch it to the side quick
Let me hit it like this
Got a put your leg up, eat it till you fed up
Premium the snapshot, show it for the extra
Let me lay you back, put that, put that on the stretcher

[Chorus]
Blowing bands on you
Just like horns do at halftime (Pa-rum-pum-pum)
Now I don't give a fuck about your old nigga, or your new nigga
That's mine (All mine)
And don't nobody got to know
But your friend that came last time
We came again and again and again last time
So say what you want, don't be scared (Don't be scared)
Closed mouths don't get fed (Yeah)
Closed mouths don't get fed (Yeah)
Closed mouths don't get fed (Yeah)
Clothes off on this bed (This bed)
Showoff yeah, hell yeah, how I want it
Toes pointed, back arched, legs spread
Closed mouths don't get fed (Don't get fed)
Closed mouths don't get fed (Don't get fed)
Closed mouths don't get fed (Don't get fed)
How I want it, toes pointed, back arched, legs spread
Closed mouths don't get fed


[Verse 2]
If you want it, say you want it (I know you want it)
We ain't got nothing but time (I got the time)
Say the word and I'll be on it (woo woo)
Tell me what you got in mind (Let's gonna talk)
Damn you fine shit, shine like candle light shit
Like a candle light, can't deny, you on my dick
Want you, hold yo leg up, flip it, I call heads up
Put that booty face down
Buzz it like some grams down
Think I get your face now
Love the way you taste now
I won't let a motherfucking trip go to waste now
I'ma make you motherucking drip from the waist down
Eat it like some takeout, better make you break down

[Chorus]
Blowing bands on you
Just like horns do at halftime (Pa-rum-pum-pum)
Now I don't give a fuck about your old nigga, or your new nigga
That's mine (All mine)
And don't nobody got to know
But your friend that came last time
We came again and again and again last time
So say what you want, don't be scared (Don't be scared)
Closed mouths don't get fed (Don't get fed)
Closed mouths don't get fed (Don't get fed)
Closed mouths don't get fed (Don't get fed)
Clothes off on this bed (This bed)
Showoff yeah, hell yeah, how I want it
Toes pointed, back arched, legs spread
Closed mouths don't get fed (Don't get fed)
Closed mouths don't get fed (Don't get fed)
Closed mouths don't get fed (Don't get fed)
How I want it, toes pointed, back arched, legs spread
Closed mouths don't get fed
