[Verse 1:]
The day started off with six chicks callin
Runnin off with game and then ballin
And no matter how trife they say you be
That's just how it go with the life you lead
Gotta keep it fresh so you cop what you wearin
(Fresh jeans, crisp tee this game is icy)
And now you gotta get a pair of timbs and that be just
The time when she walks in
Oooh

[Chorus:]
You never know
One minute you could be in the middle of your best pimpin
Ooo you never know
Next minute you could meet you a chick and you start fallin
Guess you never know
When the game seem to change and you never be the same again
Ooo you never know
(you never know)
You never know

[Verse 2:]
So now you try to shake this thing that you feelin
But you can't cause her body got you feenin
No matter how many dimes you may have seen
Why is it that this one got what you need
So now you callin six times in a row
And you know it's gettin out of control
Cause now you walk around all day stressin and it started
From the time she walks in
Guess you never know

[Chorus:]
You never know
One minute you could be in the middle of your best pimpin
Ooo you never know
Next minute you could meet you a chick and you start fallin
You never know
When the game seem to change and you never be the same again
Ooo you never know
(You never know)
You never know

[Bridge:]
Ooo ohhh oooo
It's funny when change come kickin in
And you look around and the pimp that you knew is vanishing
Nooo
You never thought that this could be
Judging by the thangs you used to do
And now you done with games and fast talking
The moment that she walked in

[Chorus:]
You never know
One minute you could be in the middle of your best pimpin
Ooo you never know
Next minute you could meet you a chick and you start fallin
You never know
When the game seem to change and you never be the same again
Ooo you never know
(you never know)
You never know

[Half of the Bridge: Trey Songz]
Like when you try to shoot game and your shot don't fall the same
Ooh ooh
You play your cards don't seem to work
And you get your feelings hurt
I said you never know

[Chorus]
