[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
You used to fall through when I call like, "Baby what you need?"
Ask me, "Can I bring a friend? Do you got drinks? Wanna eat? Need weed?"
And now you act like you don't have the time again
When anything I'd ask you, you would find a way

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Don't you miss the way a nigga hit it? Sucking it and licking while I kiss it
Don't you miss the time we were spending? Baby, you was mine, you was with it
Where he got you hiding? Tryna find you babe
'Cause every time I'm calling, you decline me babe

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Oh, you ain't gotta tell me I know
We'll never be the same as before
But I can only tell you how I feel right now, I'm missing how you feel right now
You can call when you're man ain't around, I gotcha
Oh, how you gonna act like that? I just don't get it
Tell me does he do it, do you do it just like we did it?
Clock stop ticking, guess I ran out of minutes
I can hear your heart, is it saying that we've finished?
Girl we was the best, how could you
How could you, how could you forget?
How could you forget?
How could you forget?
How could you forget?

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
He must treat you good, bet he does
He must be the man I never was
No response, no reply, every time I try to get through
So when you hear this on the radio, it's about you

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Don't you miss the way a nigga hit it? Sucking it and licking while I kiss it
Don't you miss the time we were spending? Baby, you was mine, you was with it
Where he got you hiding? Tryna find you babe
'Cause every time I'm calling, you decline me babe

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Pusha T]
Oh, you ain't gotta tell me I know
We'll never be the same as before
But I can only tell you how I feel right now, I'm missing how you feel right now
You can call when you're man ain't around, I gotcha
Oh, how you gonna act like that? I just don't get it
Tell me does he do it, do you do it just like we did it?
Clock stop ticking, guess I ran out of minutes
I can hear your heart, is it saying that we've finished?
Girl we was the best, how could you
How could you, how could you forget?
How could you forget?
How soon we forget
How could you forget?
We can't be over
How could you forget?
He gon' ask who taught you that

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
You never did this before, you wasn't hittin' ignore
I had you tendin' on shores
You got the man, is you sure?
You got the man is you sure?
He don't know you like I know you
He don't know like you like them hoes too, he's not supposed to
You was experimentin', we was just tryin' shit
That's just what young bitches go through
I made you pretty, you was just hopeful
I was like Diddy, you were my Total
You were my Cassie, you was just local
Showed you the world, I made you global

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Oh, you ain't gotta tell me I know
We'll never be the same as before
But I can only tell you how I feel right now, I'm missing how you feel right now
You can call when you're man ain't around, I gotcha
Oh, how you gonna act like that? I just don't get it
Tell me does he do it, do you do it just like we did it?
Clock stop ticking, guess I ran out of minutes
I can hear your heart, is it saying that we've finished?
Girl we was the best, how could you
How could you, how could you forget?
How could you forget?
How could you forget?
How could you forget?
