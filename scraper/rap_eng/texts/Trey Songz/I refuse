(speaking)
I mean you know I love you
And, And I know you love me so..
I just, I don’t see how you could let go so easily
Cause I refuse..

[Verse 1]
Tell me why it don’t feel like we in love anymore
I can’t explain how we got here cause I’m not sure
Did somebody close the door?
I might’ve said some things I didn’t mean and
You probably did some crazy things to me but so what..
That’s just us
That ain’t a good enough reason to give it up

[Hook]
I can’t, I won’t.. fall out of love. I ain’t givin up
No chance, No way
I refuse
I’m never letting go
I’ll never grow old
So if you ask if it’s over baby, I refuse

[Verse 2]
Trying to figure out why we don’t make time anymore
And I hope it ain’t no one else cause we don’t touch anymore
Well at least not like before
I know you get so sick and tired of me and...
But then again you make me wanna leave but so what
That’s just us
Still ain’t no reason to give it up

[Hook]
I can’t, I won’t.. fall out of love. I ain’t givin up
No chance, No way
I refuse
I’m never letting go
I’ll never grow old
So if you ask if it’s over baby, I refuse

[Bridge]
I’m gonna fight. I put that on my life
If it don’t work out I can’t say I didn’t try
It won’t be easy, but if you wit me… I promise we gon make it to the other side
We don’ put too much into this, to throw it all away
Girl lets do whatever
Swear it’s gon’ get better
Got’s to find a way
Cause baby I cain't

[Hook]
I can’t, I won’t.. fall out of love. I ain’t givin up
No chance (no chance), No way. (no way)
I refuse. (I refuse to give my love away)
I’m never letting go
I’ll never grow old
So if you ask if it’s over baby, I refuse

It don been to long. We don been together
Thought that we were strong
Could make it through the weather
Rain & Snow gon’ fall
Your love I won’t lose
She want me to give it up
I refuse
