Verse1-
Baby we were like flowers to water
No better yet coke to a snorter
We were like Martin and Gina
Never let nothing come between us
See baby were like a dream,dream of a land far away,away
Had to go and throw it all away
I hope it was worth it
Through with the hurting
Girl its for certain..
Chorus-
Baby its sad to say
I know that it was you that
Made me feel this way
Never thought it'd be a day that I
I don't love you anymore,baby its a shame to see
Being without you ain't a thing to me
Never thought it'd come a day that I
I don't love you anymore
Verse2-
I never thought that this would be
A one true fantasy
Turned to a tragedy
But all in reality
It was you to be the cause of my doom(yeah)
Since that day I changed the game,thoughts of you done left
My brain,girl I just don't love you anymore,no
Chorus(2x)-
Baby its sad to say
I know that it was you that
Made me feel this way
Never thought it'd be a day that I
I don't love you anymore
Baby its a shame to see,that being without
You ain't a thing to me
Never thought it'd come a time that I
I don't love you anymore
Bridge-
See baby we were like a dream
When you threw it away
Oh yeah,huh and girl I just don't love you anymore,all I can say
Chorus(2x)-
Baby its sad to say
I know that it was you that
Made me feel this way
Never thought it'd be a day that I
I don't love you anymore
Baby it's a shame to see
That being without you ain't a thing to me
Never thought it'd come a time that I
I don't love you anymore
