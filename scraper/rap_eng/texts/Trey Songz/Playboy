[Chorus]
Don't know why I'm still
Still kissing girls that I don't love
Still stumbling out of these clubs
Still, I'm just so hard to trust
Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still)
Still running 'round tryin' to lay up
Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to
Don't know why I'm still a playboy

[Verse 1]
Too many nights to remember
So many girls, I can't count
Can't keep track of these adventures
What has become of me now?
I thought each one was special
Oh, who am I kidding?
Why do the things feel so good?
That are so forbidden, okay
That's enough of child's play
I think it's time to settle down
But the game won't let me out

[Chorus]
Don't know why I'm still
Still kissing girls that I don't love
Still stumbling out of these clubs
Still, I'm just so hard to trust
Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still)
Still running 'round tryin' to lay up
Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to
Don't know why I'm still a playboy

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling all kinds of pressure
My momma wants another grandchild
Can't say I'm not making the effort
But these women keep calling me out
I guess I'm losing this battle
Oh, I'd be trippin'
Why do things that feel so good?
Put me in this position, okay
That's enough of child's play
I think it's time to settle down (settle down)
But the game won't let me out

[Chorus]
Don't know why I'm still (I'm still)
Still kissing girls that I don't love
Still stumbling out of these clubs
Still, I'm just so hard to trust
Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still)
Still running 'round tryin' to lay up (lay up)
Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to
Don't know why I'm still a playboy

[Bridge]
Goes down way too many times in my DM
Gave me way too many signs, I ainâ€™t see them
I just hope that I ain't too late
I just hope that I ain't sealed my fate
Oh baby, can I, can I pick it up?
Can I get back the love?
I really want to change my life
Girl, there's nothing that I want more now
But the game won't let me out

[Chorus]
Don't know why I'm still
Still kissing girls that I don't love
Still stumbling out of these clubs
Still, I'm just so hard to trust
Don't know why I'm still a playboy (still)
Still running 'round tryin' to lay up (lay up)
Still fucking but I wanna make love, I really want to
Don't know why I'm still a playboy
