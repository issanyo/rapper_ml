[Intro]
Got it on my mind
Heavy on my heart
Fuckin' with my soul
Tryna not to get bought

[Verse 1]
I swear I got a lot on my mind
It's gettin' kinda heavy on my heart
I swear this shit is fuckin' with my soul
Nigga tryin' not to get bought
I just had a dream gettin' rich
So my mama won't poor no more, no more, no more
It's a couple niggas I was with from the fuckin' front porch
Switched up, we don't roll no more
All I wanna be is alive, I know a lot of niggas had to die
Couple niggas doin' time, tryna take it all in stride
Tryna not to lose control
Tryna keep a nigga mind right, right, right

[Hook]
She like, "Wassup for the night"
I'm like "I'm drinkin' and smokin' like usual"
And she like, "We fuckin' tonight?"
I'm like, "Just hit me up, come through like usual"
Girl, tell me what it feels like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell me am I livin' real life
Make me feel good, make me feel real right
Gettin' high like this is my life
Yeah, tell me what it feels like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell me am I livin' real life
Feeling so good, give a nigga chills, right
Gettin' high like this is my life
Just close your eyes, she'll make it better
You'll never get your shit together
You probably be like this forever
Know you need these pain killers
These pain killers, know you need these pain killers, killers

[Verse 2]
Swear I got a lot on my mind
Shit is layin' heavy on my heart
But niggas steady fuckin' with the hoes
A nigga just bought another watch, yeah
Her pussy's so overrated, yeah
But it feels good when I'm faded
Goin' through motions and changes
Sippin' this potion, it's dangerous
All she wanna feel is alive, but the way she livin' is a lie
She just tryna take it all in stride
Tryin' not to lose control
Tryin' not to lose her mind, right, right, right

[Hook]
