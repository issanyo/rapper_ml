[Intro: Trey Songz]
Songbook, baby

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Lil mama with them big old cheeks
Make a nigga wanna spend his check he made this week
Let them hoes get mad 'cause them hoes so weak
Spend a bag on your bag and your hair on fleek
Oh yeah, push that thing on me
You got me open, girl, but understand I'm a G
You just want the real so you hating on me
Niggas said they showing love but they hating on me

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Yeah, go 'head with your cute ass
Whatever nigga fucked up is a dumbass
Let me make it right, girl, you deserve that
Sundresses make a nigga wanna grab that
Yeah, push that thing on me
Keep it so classy but I know you a freak
Tell me I ain't lying, take a ride with me
And pull up in this thing with me, let’s go


[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Push that thing on me
Jenny Lo' with the booty, sit that ass on me
Don't do it for the mirror, shake that ass for a G
Girl, you look good, put that ass on me
Oh, push that thing on me
Jenny Lo' with the booty, sit that ass on me
Don't do it in the mirror, shake that ass for a G
Girl, you look good, put that ass on me

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Oh, you know that you're my favorite piece
They was thinking 'bout your ass when they made this beat
I've been thinking 'bout your ass every day this week
You the best, keep it wet, that's a major key
Oh yeah, push that thing on me
Let these other niggas know you came with a G
I'ma keep it real cause they ain't gon' be
Niggas say they showing love but they hating on me

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Yeah, go 'head with your cute ass
Whatever nigga fucked up is a dumbass
Let me make it right, girl, you deserve that
Sundresses make a nigga wanna grab that
Yeah, push that thing on me
Keep it so classy but I know you a freak
Tell me I ain't lying, take a ride with me
And pull up in this thing with me, let’s go
