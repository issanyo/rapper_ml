[Intro]
Come on and lay it down (Yeah baby relax)
Lay your head down, lay your head down
(I know you got a lot of things going on
But right now you could just lay it down)
Lay your head down, lay your head down
(Get that stress off your mind
Make you feel good in the meantime)
Lay your head down, lay yo head down
Lay yo head down, lay yo head down

[Verse 1]
Passion with the pleasure, you know that's my shit
Who's gon' do you better? You know that's my shit
Every time we together, we're on some fly shit
I'm gon' change the weather, when I'm inside it
Looking at you now, baby you a show-off
Don't you slow down, baby girl go off
Let your hair down, let me take a load off
And your body's so soft, do it till we doze off

[Chorus]
Lay your head down, lay your head down
Anybody that calls, they can hit you tomorrow
Don't pick it up
Lay your head down, lay your head down
Know you're safe in my arms, give a fuck what they want
Don't pick it up
Lay your head down, lay your head down
Leave your clothes at the door
Kiss your body before I give you this love
Lay your head down, lay your head down
And I won't disappoint, let's get straight to the point

[Verse 2]
Know you had a long day, you deserve a long break
You can have it all day, fuck with you the long way
You deserve a good time, you deserve a long night
So many things on your mind, let me make it alright
Looking at you now, baby you a show-off
Don't you slow down, baby girl go off
Let your hair down, let me take a load off
And your body's so soft, do it till we doze off

[Chorus]
Lay your head down, lay your head down
Anybody that calls, they can hit you tomorrow
Don't pick it up
Lay your head down, lay your head down
Know you're safe in my arms, give a fuck what they want
Don't pick it up
Lay your head down, lay your head down
Leave your clothes at the door
Kiss your body before I give you this love
Lay your head down, lay your head down
And I won't disappoint, let's get straight to the point

[Outro]
Look baby I know you got a lot of things going on but right now
Just lay it down
Get that stress of your mind, make you feel good in the meantime
Lay yo head down, lay yo head down
Leave your clothes at the door
Kiss your body before I give you this love
Lay your head down, lay your head down
Lay your head down, lay your head down
