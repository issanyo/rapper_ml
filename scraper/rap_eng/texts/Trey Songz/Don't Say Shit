Put a lil' baby in lil' baby body
Take her off the market, then she won't be shoppin'
If she want, I cop it, it don't matter, I got it
She know I'm a beast, plus I love a freak
New beats, no headphones
You a wild child, I'm a wild guy

Don't nobody know that you a freak, girl, I won't tell a soul
Keep it on the low, oh yeah, I won't let 'em know

They ain't gotta know, they ain't gotta know (Gotta know)
Lick that body down, kiss that ooh slow (Kiss it slow)
Bust it up and down, let me fuck it slow (Fuck it slow, yeah)
Never let 'em know, never let 'em know
We go back and forth
Girl, I'm never keepin' score (Keepin' score)
Need your love, I can never, no
