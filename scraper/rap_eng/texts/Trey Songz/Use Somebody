I'm right here baby

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you

And all you know and how you speak
Girl, girl cause all I want is
Someone like you
Someone like you

And I've been looking around
Looking down at all I see
