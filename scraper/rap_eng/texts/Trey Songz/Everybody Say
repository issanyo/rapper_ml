Okay, so you feel like you tellin' them what they wanna hear, huh? Yeah, we been sayin' that

We them ones, been there since day one
You hear anything different, just call that hearsay, Dave East

[Verse 3: Dave East]
Uh, that's what everybody say
Cuban 'round my neck'll brighten everybody day
Used to hit the club and they make everybody pay
Now I pull up with a tool that make everybody wait
Everybody told me I'd be dead by 21
By 22 I had to really go and get a gun
Never stand still, couple homies on the run
I never tell, know that money better come
Yeah, that's what everybody say
They ain't love me, now I'm makin' everybody pay
I get love in Cali like I fuck with Dr. Dre
Used to take the 6 train, now Trigga got me in the Wraith
You know me, I'm puttin' niggas in they place
Prolly dealin' with a case, couple bitches in my face
Went from turnin' 16 to an 8th
Quarter, half, 48, next minute, the next day
Hey, that's what everybody say
I ain't sellin' niggas nothin', I ain't ever seen they face
Who you? Hey, that's what everybody say
Think you got the wrong number, you ain't mean to call Dave
Not me, nah, you ain't mean to call Trey
I was in the hallway tryna get it all day
You don't even know a nigga's forte
I survived Harlem nights, got it right on Broadway
I got some money, I went, got some ammo
My niggas militant, they rockin' camo
You think you lit, I will blow out your candle
My man touchin' kis, he don't play no piano
No, that's what everybody say
Hey, I've been that nigga, by the way
I've been fuckin' with Trigga, by the way
Hey, but that's what everybody say
