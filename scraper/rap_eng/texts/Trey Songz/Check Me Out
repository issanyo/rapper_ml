[Intro: Diddy]
Throw some motherfuckin' money in the air

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Stop, pose, what's that?
Bend it over quick, throw your butt back
Tuned in for the mill, where the bucks at?
She see me spend a couple mill like fuck that
She wanna ride on it like a bus pass
Give me smart brain and a dumb pack
Gon' poke it out, thumb tack
Back that ass up, I'ma front that
Knock it out the park, let these other niggas bunt that
Turn the music up, where the club at?
Throw a couple stacks, where the 1's at?
Shout to all the women that know they got that come back
Girl, you got that I can see it from the front back
She said "Damn, they be hatin', where the love at?"
I said "Damn that, you lookin' like you does that"
Hair up, damn, she done brought the fuckin' bun back
Niggas shady, damn, bring the sun back
Beat crazy, damn, bring the drums back
This yo city, nigga, damn, how I run that?
Forgot I was a singer, damn, bring the run back

You say you work hard, where you work at?

I'ma beat it up. I'ma, I'ma hurt that
Single momma, yeah yeah, I support that
I don't judge baby, I ain't tryna court that
I don't play baby, I ain't tryna sport that
Talkin' 'bout it's real when I know somebody bought that
My time money and you niggas can't afford that
Bad bitches in the studio where I record that
Right now and I'm finna pipe down
Once I'm done this verse shit, I'ma kill this pussy, I'ma hearse it
I'ma fool with it, super cool with it
While you snoozin', I got a booze in it

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Uh, check me out, though, I'm in that Ralph Lo
Red bottoms for the models, never Aldo
Catch me ridin', Maseratti with the top low
And I get deep up in that pussy, then I outro
Bad bitch and the miles low
Oh, that's your main chick? That's my side hoe
She a dime and she a dime, so we don't know
When I compare 'em it's like a Chevy, a Tahoe
Yo Trigga, where the hoes?
I'm in the Margielas, they like "What are those?"
I got them guys jealous 'cause I'm gettin' dough
She said she never seen a ghost 'til she was in my Rolls
Lookey here, I'ma keep it real with you
Get it clear, I ain't tryna chill with you
Give her here so I can put the steel in ya
Now, shorty bust it open for a real nigga

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Ay, check me out though, I'ma keep it real with you
Ay, check me out though, I'm just tryna chill with you
Ay, check me out though, I'ma keep it real with you
Che-Check me out
Ay, check me out though, I'ma keep it real with you
Ay, check me out though, I'm just tryna chill with you
Ay, check me out though, I'ma keep it real with youChe-check me out, um daddy

[Outro: Diddy]
See, this right here, this goes out
To all the motherfuckin'
Gettin' money bitches in the house
Don't stop, let's work, let's rock
Don't stop, let's work, let's rock
Throw some motherfuckin' money in the air
Throw some motherfuckin' money in the air
Um daddy
