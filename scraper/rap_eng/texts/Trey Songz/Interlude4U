[Verse]
Yeah, this is for you
(No matter how much I let you down)
Only for you
(Ain't going nowhere, nowhere)
If I can't have you no one can
(Me for you)
It can only be me
You think I'm crazy huh? Maybe I am
You kept me on this pedestal no matter how much I let you down

[Chorus]
Just tell me that you'll hold me down
(Just me for you, for you)
I got you baby, I got you
(You can never find another man)
Just me, for you
(Just me for you, for you)

[Outro]
Girl, I'd rather die, if you took your love somewhere
Don't you even try, no, don't you take your love, away
You kept me on this pedestal no matter how much I let you down
Too long, you've had me on this pedestal
