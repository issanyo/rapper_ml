[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want nobody more than you
Just want your body on this morning dew
I got these covers laying right for us
Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching us

[Verse 1]
I feel like tonight we should switch it up
No couch, no bed, no kitchen floor
Oh, can I take your body on a ride?
Take you to the park, then hit it on the slide
I basically, wanna do it to you outside
Top down with the stars looking inside
Always wanted to do you in the pool
And all night all our light is the moon

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want nobody more than you
I just want your body on this morning dew
I got these covers laying right for us
Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching us

[Chorus]
Outside, front seat of my car, underneath the stars
Let's make love outside, I don't really care, if anybody sees us
Making love, I want you to keep going baby
Making love, I don't care if they call us crazy
Outside, I don't even care, anyone can stare
While we're outside

[Verse 2]
If you catch someone looking all you gotta do is close your eyes
Girl, don't you say a peep, dig your nails into my spine
We can take it to the roof top baby
Or the elevator then take it to the roof top baby
With you on top baby, no need to be curious about what I'm gon' do
I wanna make your you know storm tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want nobody more than you
Just want your body on this morning dew
I got these covers laying right for us
Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching us

[Chorus]
Outside, front seat of my car, underneath the stars
Let's make love outside, I don't really care, if anybody sees us
Making love, I want you to keep going baby
Making love, I don't care if they call us crazy
Outside, I don't even care, anyone can stare
While we're outside

[Outro]
I don't want nobody more than you
Just want your body on this morning dew
I got these covers laying right for us
Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching us
