I think I'm in love, she with that shit
I got a blunt, she'll hit that shit
We in the club and I see a girl and I think it's best she'll get that bitch
Holy above, I'm with that shit
I got a brick, she'll flip that shit
If I was rich and I go broke
She gonna make sure I get back rich
Who you think coming paying the bill
Rocking Giuseppes and a bag from Channel
Body hi-def and a booty to kill
Driver, roll up your partition please
I got a bad bitch on her knees
Saying I'm a dog, I ain't got no fleas
Now pedal to the floor in the drop top V

She wanted to come, started busting off soon as I touched that
So I told her hold still, let me hit it right there 'cause you know I gotta bust back
Killing these bitches in line, I'm down

They sucking my dick while I'm riding around
That's your ma, she wanna suck my dick while she replied
Scruffy nigga but he be flying, ride around in two-seater ride
I'm a bitch's dream, if I was you I wouldn't sleep on me
