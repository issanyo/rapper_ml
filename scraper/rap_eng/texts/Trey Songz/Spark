What she got on got her lookin' like a star
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Make me wonder what it look like when it's off
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Got me lookin' at your body, bet it's soft
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, I just wanna know who you are

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Just slow down, baby
Girl, you sparkin' my interest
Slow down, baby
Girl, you sparkin' my interest
Don't you make me chase you, why you so distant?
Slow down, baby
Girl, you sparkin' my-

[Verse: Trey Songz]
Usually I don't press nobody
But lately you the one I make exceptions for
I'm outside of stress, no body
But, really, I'm just tryna get to know you more
Tell me if I'm doin' too much
Shawty, where you goin', what's the rush?
I just need a moment, got me takin' notice
You got all my focus (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & Jacquees]
What she got on got her lookin' like a star
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Make me wonder what it look like when it's off
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Got me lookin' at your body, bet it's soft
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, I just wanna know who you are

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Just slow down, baby
Girl, you sparkin' my interest
Slow down, baby
Girl, you sparkin' my interest
Don't you make me chase you, why you so distant?
Slow down, baby

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
Girl, you so fine
What's your name, where you from?
What's your sign, what you drive, why you come?
To get high, feel the vibe, one on one
Kinky time, girl, we ball, fuck a pump
Girl, I read your mind, got you focused
Girl, I read your mind, got you focused
Too much, head is round, got me hopin'
She gon' let me take it off and keep it open

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & Jacquees]
What she got on got her lookin' like a star
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Make me wonder what it look like when it's off
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Got me lookin' at your body, bet it's soft
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, I just wanna know who you are

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Just slow down, baby
Girl, you sparkin' my interest
Slow down, baby
Girl, you sparkin' my interest
Don't you make me chase you, why you so distant?
Slow down, baby
