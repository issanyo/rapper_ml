[Hook: Maino & Trey Songz]
Yeah, they love it when I come through
Rollin' like a thug dude, top down, glidin' in somethin' new
I got 'em like oh, oh, oh

They see me in the hood and everywhere I'm good
And they lovin' and respectin' like they should
I got 'em like oh, oh, oh
I get hood love, oh, oh, oh, hood love

[Verse 1: Maino]
Manio, I keep it all hood
And I will never change, never go Hollywood
Let it be understood that I'll be in the hood
Right where the strip is poppin', right on I block I'm good
Now what this niggas thinkin'? That I don't really be in
Places that I'll be speakin', the ghetto's what I am dippin'
My weapons be conceal, I'm livin' how I feel
So fuck the record deal, nigga my record meal
Now what you heard about me, the playin' controversy
Now homie don't you doubt me, I keep 'em killers 'round me
I come from Kings County, these haters wanna doubt me
See how these bitches tell me, New York about the crazy

[Verse 2: Maino]
Listen, look, now everybody know me, they get it poppin' for me
You just can't come around here unless you say you know me
I'm be in' places that, rappers don't never be
They say they come from out here but we don't ever see
Me and my bougie bitch, we in to CL coupe
Mami, you good with me, my love is bullet proof
I only speak the truth, my ties is really strong
Now watch me hop out those gates, put on my jewelry on
Now you can't tell me that I don't get hood respect
I bought the candy truck right, right in the projects
This ain't goin'  as bad, the sell the weed at
After the studio baby, that's where I'd be at

[Verse 3: Maino]
Listen, so my niggas that's from the hood, they call it home
To my hustlers try to stay off the cellular phones
We on the corner, we drinkin' in friends memories
I try to tell 'em, I'll never ever be industry
I'm still in the street, I'm so hurry now
The black bandana, my hoodie pulled down
I'm so ghetto right, I'm so ghetto fly
I'm so stuck in my ways, I live a ghetto life

[Hook: Maino & Trey Songz]
Yeah, they love it when I come through
Rollin' like a thug dude, top down, glidin' in somethin' new

They see me in the hood and everywhere I'm good
And they lovin' and respectin' like they should
I got 'em like oh, oh, oh
I get hood love, oh, oh, oh, hood love

[Outro: Trey Songz]
Hood love, hood love, hood love
Oh, oh, oh, hood love
