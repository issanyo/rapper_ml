[Intro]
I like it

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl
When you take it off, take it off
When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side
With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal

[Verse 1]
Girl, you know I'm on my way now
Girl, you know I'm on my way, my way to you
I'ma bring my anaconda
Gonna get to, get to your forbidden fruit
Turn the bed into a jungle
I'm Tarzan, you be my Jane up in this room
Girl, you know I'm finna hunt ya, yeah
You the one I been preyin' on

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm the leader of the pack
Boomerang, boomerang, baby, gon' and throw it back
Do your thang, do your thang, girl, you dunno how to act
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'ma eat that pussy cat

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl
When you take it off, take it off
When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side
With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal
Animal, uh huh, yeah
Animal

[Verse 2]
This that ghetto Kama Sutra
Twist and bend and bend and twistin' all around
Treat you like you're in danger
And this the last time that I can take you down
That National Geographic (uh huh)
Document it and record it on a film
Anybody got a camera? Uh
Oh, you wanna experiment

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm the leader of the pack
Boomerang, boomerang, baby, gon' and throw it back
Do your thing, do your thing, girl, you dunno how to act
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'ma eat that pussy cat, ayy

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl
When you take it off, take it off
When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side
With all those freaky thoughts, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal, woah, yeah
Woah, animal, woah
You bring out the animal

[Verse 3]
I go ape up on the donkey (throw that ass)
I be throwin' this banana all around (sheesh)
Put my face up in the monkey (my mask)
No umbrella but the rain is pourin' down
Kill the kitty, no lion
Big mon, I'm a well up in your sea (for real)
Got your body flyin', oh
No you feelin' like a dove, give me love

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a boss, I'm a boss, I'm the leader of the pack
Boomerang, boomerang, baby, gon' and throw it back
Do your thing, do your thing, girl, you dunno how to act
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'ma eat that pussy cat (go)

[Chorus]
I ain't gonna lie but baby, you get pretty wild, girl
When you take it off, take it off
When days turn to night, that's when you show your other side
With all those freaky thoughts, yeah, freaky thoughts
You bring out the animal, woah
Animal, woah
You bring out the animal, grrrr
