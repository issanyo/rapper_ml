[Verse 1]
Said she want love, I'ma hold you down
Said you needed a provider, well you got one now
Shooting stars pass by 'cause we up so high, yeah, we up so high
Outer space don't have no time and you know times fly, yeah, you know time fly

[Chorus]
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one
Now you stuck with a real one
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one
Now you stuck with a real one
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one
Now you stuck with a real one
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one
Now you stuck with a real one

[Verse 2]
Ride 'til you die baby, you got the Range
I watch you grow baby, I like the change
Stuck with me now like a permanent stain
Like a permanent stain
I go for you baby girl, can you blame me?
You took the beast out the jungle and tamed it
Stuck with me now like I'm under the table
Like I'm under the table
Now you in love with a real one, suck with a real one, take a breath, relax
'Cause the bills get paid on time and I feel you pain like it's mine
We took the pieces and put 'em together, won't let 'em come apart, no
Won't separate our hearts, no, won't separate our hearts, no

[Chorus]
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one
Now you stuck with a real one
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one
Now you stuck with a real one
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one
Now you stuck with a real one
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one
Now you stuck with a real one

[Outro]
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one all of your life now
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one, girl, I'ma do you right
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one, girl, you stuck with a real one
Now, now, now, now you stuck with a real one, now you stuck
With a real one that's gon' do your body right every night
Make sure you can feel something real
Tell me how your kids do, what you had to eat
Girl, I keep your tank full and you're never on E
