I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way your hair blows in the wind
And I miss you stayin' here till the mornin'
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everythin' about you, baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out, do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
'Cause I can't get you out of my mind
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seein' your face
In every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it? Simply 'cause I can't
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was still there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
Missin' everythin' you say
Missin' all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away?
I want you to know
It's been hell tryna do this without you here
Baby, '07 supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was goin' out
'Cause I knew you were tell me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seein' your face
In every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it? Simply 'cause I can't
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
Wish I could wake up and forget about you
Not tryin' to call you when I know I want to
I gotta fight this feelin' can't let it take over me
You just don't understand how much you were a part of me
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was there
With you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missin' you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missin' you
I can't stop missin' you
I don't wanna stop, I can't stop missin' you
Baby, I can't stop missin' you
No, no, no, no, I can't stop missin' you
