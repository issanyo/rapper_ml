Lately I just don't know what to do, ooh ooh ooh

I know you don't want to wait for me, aye
They say you should stay away from me, (no) aye
I know you the only babe for me, pray for me
Gratefully you love me too (ooh ah ah)
Know a lot of men would do you better
Know that I done put you through whatever
I know that you care for me, I know you'll be there for me
If ever something happen you still down
Real one, I guess I'm just a fool with her
Looking in the mirror like, ain't you scared to lose her?
Why you acting like another man wouldn't choose her?
You know she the only true girl, ooh girl

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't even lie yeah you got me falling (fall)
Even when I try and the game keep calling (call)
Why we in the club, why I'm always ballin' (ball)
Tryna' be in love, we don't fall too often
It's hard to (fall), but you got me falling (fall)
Even when I try and the hoes keep calling (call)
Why we in the club, why I'm always ballin' (ball)
Tryna' be in love, we don't fall too often
It's hard to (fall), but still

[Chorus]
I don't want nobody else but you
I don't want nobody else but you, ooh ah ah
Nobody else but you, ooh ah ah
I don't want nobody else but you

[Verse 2]
They catch us on the low and I know you hate that (true)
They say that I'm yours and you say it ain't that (true)
And every time it goes I just bring the pain back, yeah
Break ups to make ups that-that's just the way it goes (ooh ah ah)
Know a lot of men would do you better (ooh ah)
Know that I done put you through whatever (ooh ah)
I know that you care for me, I know what you spared for me
I know you won't wait on me forever (noooo)
Real one, I guess I'm just a fool with her
Looking in the mirror like, ain't you scared to lose her?
Why you acting like another man wouldn't choose her?
You know she the only true girl, ooh girl

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't even lie yeah you got me falling (fall)
Even when I try and the game keep calling (calling my name)
Why we in the club, why I'm always ballin' (ball)
Tryna' be in love, we don't fall too often
It's hard to (fall), but you got me falling (fall)
Even when I try and the hoes keep calling (call)
Why we in the club, why I'm always ballin' (ball)
Tryna' be in love, we don't fall too often
It's hard to (fall), but still
