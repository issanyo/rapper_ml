Feels good ya know
Out of all the hotties in the world
I got everything I need in one girl
She the most amazing thing to me
And it ain't just what I see
It's the way that she love me
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
Now I have many friends
That be going round
In and out a club thinkin'
Tryna find that special one, oh yes they do
But nothing's better than chemistry
And especially the kind between you and me
Makes me wanna shout out to the world
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
Now, she means more than all of the world
I wouldn't trade her love for anything in this world
'Cause when we touchin' and we kissing
And ain't never nothing missing
And I love the way she love me
Be all on me if I diss it
She so amazing to me
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen
You could lose everything and still be my everything
Let me tell you how it feels to be with her
Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
Fresh white linen

And ain't never nothing missing
And I love the way she love me
Be all on me if I diss it
She so amazing to me

Dopest chick alive it's like 20s on your ride
And the wheels keep spinnin'
