[Verse 1]
Told you from the get go, I would never let go
You remain a turn on, hope you know like I know
I'ma always love you, when nobody else do
I'm be the shelter, you can always run to
You're the one I run to, when I need a shoulder
I'm the one you run to, when you need a soldier
Say that I'm the realest one you ever met
But girl, this is the realest thing I ever said

[Pre-Chorus]
If you give me the world, then it won't mean nothing
'Cause if you leave my world, then I won't have nothing

[Chorus]
And this is from my heart, ay ay, this is from my soul, ay ay
Lovers may come, ay ay and lovers may go, ay ay
But I don't worry about a thing 'cause as long as we're together
Babe I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know that
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me

[Verse 2]
You the one I'm cool with, you know what to do with
Everything I'm giving baby, you know who the truth is
You know where the safe at, you know who my boo is
Never had a fake bag, always on that new shit
You the only beat that could play in my heart
Imagine just to think of us apart
Say that I'm the realest one you ever met
But girl, this is the realest thing I ever said

[Pre-Chorus]
If you give me the world, then it won't mean nothing
'Cause if you leave my world, then I won't have nothing

[Chorus]
And this is from my heart, ay ay, this is from my soul, ay ay
Lovers may come, ay ay and lovers may go, ay ay
But I don't worry about a thing 'cause as long as we're together
Babe I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know that
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me

[Bridge]
All I need, you are all I see
Gonna stay together, no matter the weather, sing it now
All I need, you are all I see
Baby I know, I know, I know
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me
