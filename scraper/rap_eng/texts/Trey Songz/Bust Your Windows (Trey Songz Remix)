[Jazmine Sullivan:]
I bust the windows out your car
And no, it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now
I don't care about that part

I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna
But I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when

You see can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them
And don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

[Trey Songz:]
Check it
Uh, Songz
Hey, hey, hey

What up, Jasmine baby?
This should get to your ears
Wanna let you know your album's great
You my new favorite baby

She bust the windows out my car
My black Mercedes
Twenty-two inch rims
I know it's probably 'cause I broke her heart
But right now
I don't care about that part

She bust the windows out my car
Couldn't believe it when I saw my ride
That very moment then I knew it was her
Can't even trip because I knew I deserve

I must admit it hurt a little bit
Thinking how could I lead her to do this
I never thought that she had so much strength
But she's gonna see what happens when

You throw a brick into a players whip
It's goin violent
It's so childish
You'll probably say that it was worth your while
Well, I hope you a chance to smile

She bust the windows out my car
My black Mercedes
Twenty-two inch rims
Wrote her initials with a black crowbar
And when I find her
I will know where to start

She bust the windows out my car
And man I'm lucky that that's all she did
I gotta fix this
Ain't this some bullshit

She bust my windows out my car
Went too far
Just cause the love thing we call ours fell apart
But she had to fuck up my car

But I ain't no pussy
I ain't goin trip
Spend a couple dollars
I'm a fix my shit
Girl, you know that you done f'd up now

You threw a brick into a players whip
It's goin get violent
Cause it's so childish
She'll probably say that it was worth her while
Mad as I am all I can do is smile

She bust my windows
My black Mercedes
I know it's probably cause I broke her heart
I must admit I care about that part

Relationship messer-upper
Must a window buster
Baby, we made for eachother
Ain't nothin better than your'reloving & come back
I need you bad like Jasmine Sullivan
I'm a puff 'til the endo gone

Riding in the whip with the windows gone
I can see you gettin your tip toe on
Quick
Throw the brick
And dip, she's gone
Off in the night all cause of my lies

Why, I can't get it right
I ride through the city lights
With my hat bent
Behind what used to be called black tents
I don't know, y'all
Wrote her initials with a crowbar
That means shorty go hard

It was just a one-night creep off
I ain't even take my sneaks off
I swear
I mean it's just a vehicle, baby

You can throw fits
Throw bricks
You still gonna be chick
See, I can deal with some craziness
That mean you love me

Come back home, baby
Come back home
I need you bad
Hey

We just vibe out
The song will be over in a second
No trip
Just vibe to the R's
She bust the windows out my car
