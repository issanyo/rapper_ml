Let me hold that beat... [x3]
That beat
Funny, funny, funny, boy I can't stop laughing
Money, money, money, can't stop getting cash
You looking for the prince, well you found him
Broke niggas can't even be around him
And I'm only being honest, fuck being modest
Ghetto girls change hair colors like Rodman
All on my dick like a condom
And she take that dick like a robber
Call it burglary, certainly
I cut her up like surgery
And now her baby daddy wants to murder me!
He call my phone like "Is you banging my girl? My girl!"
All I reply "Playa better check her. Don't wanna to disrespect ya.. I never even met 'cha. She never even mention your name. I don't know why you mad at me. You should ask your girl. She gave the ass to me. Stop harassing me... Why you so upset with me? I don't even know you
It's clear that she had sex with me. Stop calling my phone, dude. Real G's do no questioning."

He talking bout what you gon' do, gon' do
Funny, funny, funny, boy I can't stop laughing
Money, money, money, can't stop getting cash

You a loser though
You a loser though
You a loser

Fellas if your girl let a man get at her
And you hit up the man then your ass playing backwards
Happens to the best, you are not alone
Her booty and her breat, it's nothing you can own

Funny, funny, funny, boy I can't stop laughing
Money, money, money, can't stop getting cash

Throw it in the bag, got paper got plastic
Think I got it mastered, haters are fanatics
I need them around any time I want my ass kissed
I'm only drinking brown and I'm only smoking sunkist
Orange haired weed got me acting like a wierdo
Shine like me you the diamonds in my earlobe
Heard from a bird that trigga was a asshole
Fuck what you heard like penis in your earhole
