[Hook: Trey Songz]
I got 24 inches of benjamin
When I ride
Time is just flooding my jewelry
I got 24 inches of benjamin
When I ride
Time is just flooding my jewelry
When I slime
All these things that are going in
Can I die?
I wanna be alone
Said she got it from her own

[Verse 1: Alley Boy]
I need a dime piece bitch I can slide with
Ass so thick you can tell I'm cuffing me
Need me a porn star, a freaky motherfucking cute face
When I fuck her real good, she gain weight
Bitch got money, she only shake that ass outta town
But these niggas run defeated like clowns
She wanna spar that
Money on the cell, in case I go to jail
Ain't call an ace so I can post bail
She got a man like she 35
And only 22, you got a read bitch if she fuck with you
The wolf to the lame niggas, everyday square
Can't compare to this dumb motherfucker ride trilogy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Alley Boy]
I'm in the bed with the jewelry on and some cologne
24 inch all chrome fuck up your dome
Bitch she 25 pretty face don't get it twisted
She said your ass fly, she walk like she all that
And for a price you can see the pretty pussy cat
And that ass is too fat
Oh she looking cute
She do her thing to get loot but never prostitute
Unless it's urgent, ass fat no surgery
Lil mama straight natural
Flexing ass nigga wanna trap to
Money on some old and some good dough
Ride or die you can take home
Yeah

[Hook]
