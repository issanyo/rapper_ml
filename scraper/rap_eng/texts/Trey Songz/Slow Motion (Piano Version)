[Verse 1]
You know I got all dressed up for the club
Waiting on you come pick me up
Baby, ooh, when I saw ya walking out the door
Ooh, yeah I knew ya needed something more
Now whip it straight back to the crib, ay
Finna give you something that you won't forget

[Refrain: Mario]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to...
Give you everything you want and need
That good love and protection...
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
