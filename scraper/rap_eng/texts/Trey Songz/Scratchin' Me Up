[Intro]
When we hop up in the bed, you know what it is
You gon' be on me, I'ma be on you
And it feels so good, I gotta have it
Don't it feel so good, way you be grabbing

[Chorus]
The sheets, the pillows, the dresser
The covers, the mattress
The passion, making love
Girl, you scratching me up
But it's cool
'Cause I love when we touching
I love when we kissing
Sexing, you be scratching me up

[Verse 1]
Pose for the camera while it flash
Take pictures, while we kiss I grab your ass
Nasty love, passion love, give it up
From beginning to the end, the way we get it in

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't another couple compete when we in the sheets
Breakfast in bed, love the way I eat
I love the way it be, we a couple freaks
Rocking to the rhythm and the rhythm of the beat
It's your body on my body
Clap, clap, clap, from the back, back, back
Smack, smack, smack
When I act like that, she react right back, pulling on

[Chorus]
The sheets, the pillows, the dresser
The covers, the mattress
The passion, making love
Girl, you scratching me up
But it's cool
'Cause I love when we touching
I love when we kissing
Sexing, you be scratching me up
Then I go a little deeper
Sexing, you be scratching me up
Then she scratch a little harder
Ooh girl, you scratching me up
But it's cool
'Cause I love when we touching
I love when we kissing
Sexing, you be scratching me up

[Verse 2]
Second round, ooh I love your body on mine
Grinding slow, I wanna take my time
Baby, put it on me, what it gon' be? Loving on full go until it's on E
Scream so loud we gon' need our on street

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't another couple compete when we in the sheets
Breakfast in bed, love the way I eat
I love the way it be, we a couple freaks
Rocking to the rhythm and the rhythm of the beat
It's your body on my body
Clap, clap, clap, from the back, back, back
Smack, smack, smack
When I act like that, she react right back, pulling on

[Chorus]
The sheets, the pillows, the dresser
The covers, the mattress
The passion, making love
Girl, you scratching me up
But it's cool
'Cause I love when we touching
I love when we kissing
Sexing, you be scratching me up
Then I go a little deeper
Sexing, you be scratching me up
Then she scratch a little harder
Ooh girl, you scratching me up
But it's cool
'Cause I love when we touching
I love when we kissing
Sexing, you be scratching me up

[Bridge]
Hold on girl, don't you lose it
It's made for you, please use it
Scratch my body up, girl, I don't mind
I'ma take your pain if you take mine

[Chorus]
The sheets, the pillows, the dresser
The covers, the mattress
The passion, making love
Girl, you scratching me up
But it's cool
'Cause I love when we touching
I love when we kissing
Sexing, you be scratching me up
Then I go a little deeper
Sexing, you be scratching me up
Then she scratch a little harder
Ooh girl, you scratching me up
But it's cool
'Cause I love when we touching
I love when we kissing
Sexing, you be scratching me up
