[Intro: Ashanti & Trey Songz]
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
I don't know why, I tend to love these kind of girls
Pride and joy, joy, joy
Why don't you steal my pride and joy, joy, and joy?
But you're still my pride and joy

[Hook: Miguel & Ashanti]
So, sophisticated, this young, lady
Got me going, I don't know why, I tend to love these kind of girls
She's my, baby, it's so, crazy
I can't take it, but I love it, I swear I love her though
Even if she's all about the money, I don't really care, yeah
Got a lot of money, it's enough of it that we could share
Oh, I love these kind of girls
Why don't you steal my pride and joy?

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Look at where the time went
Could never get back all the time spent
Chase time, FaceTime
Nowadays I don't even try and waste mine
Just rather drop a bag off
You see love is like a crash course
And I hate to be the bad sport
But there's one for every stamp in my passport
So I'm still takin' dimes out
And I'm still holdin' tryouts
Just never takin' timeout
Scared of what I might find out

[Hook: Miguel & Ashanti]
So, sophisticated, this young, lady
Got me going, I don't know why, I tend to love these kind of girls
She's my, baby, it's so, crazy
I can't take it, but I love it, I swear I love her though
Even if she's all about the money, I don't really care, yeah
Got a lot of money, it's enough of it that we could share
Oh, I love these kind of girls
Why don't you steal my pride and joy?

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Court-side any game, who the don?
Must be thinkin' I'm a lame shit that you been on
I gave you rose gold, everything
E'vrthing but a wedding ring
Now how you gon' creep?
Got you that bubble gum six shit to shoot up the streets, vroom
You say I'm fuckin', well you fuckin' right
I heard you fuckin' guess it's fuckin' life
So quit denyin' it 'cause niggas know
'Cause when you catch her still love her though
Ain't goin' buy more designer clothes
So why you trippin' you got finer hoes? Crack

[Verse 3: Ashanti]
It ain't even that I'm all about the money babe
It be a difference between the things, you do and say
I love you more than anything, yeah
Boy I swear you gotta stop playinf the games
Being your pride and your joy is cool
But I rather be your heart than to play a fool
'Cause my pride is everything I got
I'll be damned if I give it up, just want another knot
Oh, but you 'gon have to show me more, still my pride and joy
Because your still my pride and joy
