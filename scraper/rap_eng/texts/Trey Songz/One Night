[Intro: Yung Berg]
Yeah, we out here
Your boy Berg and Songz
Trey that is, 2 up, 2 down
Shots on Chi

[Verse 1: Yung Berg]
Yo, it goes hella hoes bobbin'
Saturday 3'o clock on Melrose shoppin'
6pm flight for more club hoppin'
Landing at H town, damn, they got it poppin'
The whole party rockin' if the young dude know how we come through
One night in town and we only got one room
Presidential suite, baby girl, with the front view
Forget about your friends, ma, I'm talkin' to you

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Said that the way you move, girl, you puttin' it down
Got me stuck in the zone, I can't leave her alone, I gotta have her around
See I don't know about you, girl, you turnin' me on, turnin' me on
Got a nigga, like hold up, wait a minute, stop, it's all on you
Would you be my lover? For one night
I just wanna hold you for one night
I don't wanna tease you, promise, I'ma please you
If you let me hold you for one night
Would you be my lover? For one night
I just wanna hold you for one night
Got a nigga, like hold up, wait a minute, stop
It's all on you

[Verse 2: Yung Berg]
So what you want me to do? I'm doin' all I possibly can
Ma, I been at the airport waitin' on stand by
All this just to catch a plane out to NY
And lay your ass down for one night
You know what I live like, yeah, the mansion, the coupe
You should've known I could never settle down with you
Until I see you in Atlanta when I'm bouncin' through
I got twenty four hours for you

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Said that the way you move, girl, you puttin' it down
Got me stuck in the zone, I can't leave her alone, I gotta have her around
See I don't know about you, girl, you turnin' me on, turnin' me on
Got a nigga, like hold up, wait a minute, stop, it's all on you
Would you be my lover? For one night
I just wanna hold you for one night
I don't wanna tease you, promise, I'ma please you
If you let me hold you for one night
Would you be my lover? For one night
I just wanna hold you for one night
Got a nigga, like hold up, wait a minute, stop
It's all on you

[Outro: Yung Berg]
Yeah, you know what it is
Your boy Berg's in the buildin'
My dude Songz' in the buildin'
And we talkin' to you baby
We only got one night, said one night
Only got one night, said one night
We only got one night, it's soundin' good
JFK bring the drums back here, right about here
It's right, it sounds so good
Don't you agree?
One night, yeah
It's so soulful, it's so beautiful
