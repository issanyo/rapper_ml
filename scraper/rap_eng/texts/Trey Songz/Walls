[Intro: Trey Songz]
Yeah, she a freak

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
She said she like it when I'm nasty
So I'ma give her what she ask for
Beat the pussy in the backseat
And she gon' suck it 'til her jaw sore, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drinkin' your juice like a liquor
I eat that pussy for breakfast
Chop that peach up like a blender
She feel me deep in her chest
Top of the morn', she give me top
I be so deep in her neck
I be so deep, she be wet
We take the sheets out the bed
We take the sheets out the bed
I took you home from the party
I took the clothes off your body
I made you cum and you cummin', you cummin'
Dug in that pussy, you runnin', you runnin'
When I'm nasty, I don't even care
Pull it if it's fake or your real hair
I don't know if that's fake or real back there
But it's like I'm on a pill, I trigg-trigg-trigg

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You know your walls will remember me
You know your walls won't forget me
You know your walls will remember me
You know your walls won't forget me

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
She said she like it when I'm nasty
Got my hands 'round her neck
So I'ma give her what she ask for
Ain't no tellin' what's next
Beat the pussy in the backseat
Whole lot of rough sex
And she gon' suck it 'til her jaw sore
Incredible neck, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drinkin' your juice like the liquor
I eat that pussy for breakfast
Chop that peach up like a blender
She feel me deep in her chest
Top of the morn', she give me top
I be so deep in her neck
I be so deep, she be wet
We take the sheets out the bed
Up in that pussy like I thought it was a trap
She let me do whatever when I'm diggin' her out
Hang her head off the bed, told her keep it right there
I fuck her face, she let me spit all in her mouth
Then I put my fingers in her holes in and out
Pretty motherfucker suck her soul right out
I got that pussy on my lips like Chapstick
I beat that pussy like my grandma did bad kids

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You know your walls will remember me
You know your walls won't forget me
You know your walls will remember me
You know your walls won't forget me

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
She said she like it when I'm nasty
I told her sit on my face
So I'ma give her what she ask for
Let a nigga get a taste
Beat the pussy in the backseat
Backseat of my Jeep
And she gon' suck it 'til her jaw sore
Do it like a real freak, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drinkin' your juice like the liquor
I eat that pussy for breakfast
Chop that peach up like a blender
She feel me deep in her chest
Top of the morn', she give me top
I be so deep in her neck
I be so deep, she be wet
We take the sheets out the bed
Up in that pussy like I thought it was a trap
I be so deep, she be wet
Thought it was a trap
Up in that pussy like I thought it was a trap
I be so deep, she be wet
We take the sheets out the bed
We take the sheets out the bed

[Verse 4: Chisanity & MIKExANGEL]
Got my fingers in that pussy like a gun
You so pretty girl, I love to watch you cum
She go crazy, she go stupid, she go dumb
She bring her friends 'cause without homies ain't no fun
No partition but she want it in the backseat
Fuck around, fuck around and get her ass eat
Can't be shy girl, that's my name, I like it nasty
She drippin' spit all on that dick, I grip her ass cheeks
That's my bitch, I call her that and she don't mind
She back it up, I smack it up and we rewind
Empty out my balls, get my name called
Since I came girl, I knock it out the frame walls

[Hook: Trey Songz & MIKExANGEL]
You know your walls will remember me
You know your walls won't forget me
You know your walls will remember me
You know your walls won't forget
