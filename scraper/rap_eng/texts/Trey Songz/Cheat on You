[Intro]
Hey ladies, I know you gotta feel me on this
You see there's something that's been worrying me and I need to get it off my chest
See when you got you a good man at home, don't you do him wrong
'Cause I'ma tell you what he thinking oh, ho, ho, whoa

[Verse 1]
It's 8:30, I know my baby kinda worried
I said I'd be there, said I'd make it in a hurry, well I ain't even on the way no, no, no
She thinking home is so perfect, but I guess it's 'cause her vision kinda blurry
She don't realize she do me so dirty and she don't recognize the things that she say
Things you say can drive a man so crazy, make him wanna leave your ass
Got one foot outside the door, I can't take no more, sometimes I wanna
Walk away and find another lady 'cause its so hard to please your ass
'Cause all the things I do for you, getting tired of the

[Chorus]
Things you do to make me wanna cheat on you
All I go through, make me wanna cheat on you
When you act a fool, I just wanna cheat on you
And I know it ain't cool, but I'm gonna cheat on you

[Verse 2]
You ain't worthy, you see my love, you don't deserve it
Can you take it, you can dish it, you can serve it, but when the tables turned on you, I'm wrong
When every man deserves happiness hey, I'm a dog, when you're the reason that it happened all along
And I try to look past it, oh but its the, its the, its the things you do

[Chorus]
Things you do to make me wanna cheat on you
All I go through, make me wanna cheat on you
When you act a fool, I just wanna cheat on you
And I know it ain't cool, but I'm gonna cheat on you

[Bridge]
Hey ladies, I know you gotta feel me on this
Uh it's, it's the things
Things you say can drive a man so crazy
Make him wanna leave your ass, woo, oh

[Chorus]
Things you do to make me wanna cheat on you
All I go through, make me wanna cheat on you and find another lady
When you act a fool, I just wanna cheat on you
And I know it ain't cool girl, but I'm gonna cheat on you
Things you do to make me wanna cheat on you
All I go through, make me wanna cheat on you and find another lady
When you act a fool, I just wanna cheat on you
Oh I do so many things for you girl and still you wanna act a fool
And I know it ain't cool, but I'm gonna cheat on you

[Outro]
Ooh, oh, dang
