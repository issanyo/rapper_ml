They said I would never be shit
They said I was never gonna amount to nothing
They said I would never make it
But guess what I did, look what I did, look what I did

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I been tryna have a different view of shit
Missed the old times and the foolishness
Old hoes moving onto the next nigga
I don't like them doing shit
I don't give a fuck who it is
They ain't never really mattered to me
Only listen when the money talks
Shit, never bring the chit chatter to me
Nigga back at it, I'm a dog with it
Still here when the fog finished
Prove yeah, we can all get it nigga
Get the money then we ball with it
Trey Trey from the Trey ward
You don't want it 'less you pray for it
Virginia nigga got plenty niggas
I'mma make a call, they gon' spray for it
Then I probably fuck a bartender
They look better than the strippers now
I ain't never gon' floss with her
Boss nigga, I'mma dick her down
Catch a nigga on the old block
Moo daddy with me on the aisle
Spending money in the old spots
For all the days that we never had
We take a trip when we touchdown
Whip on the strip when we touchdown
I ain't never gave a fuck if you find one
Tell me where the fucks found
Big bag, it's a must now
Only niggas that I trust round
And they put respek upon my name
Like a young Tremaine was from uptown

[Hook: MIKExANGEL]
They said I would never be shit
They said I was never gonna amount to nothing
They said I would never make it
But guess what I did, look what I did, look what I did

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
We be tryna balance out the load
So we copping 0's for the elevation
Hoes here so it's everywhere
Her makeup, all on the pillowcases
Heard 'em saying get it back to basics
So I took the pieces, put 'em back in places
Easy, I'm DB
I be working hoes out, dominatrix
Niggas saying there's a vacancy
Like I ain't here with the heat strapped
Cut the lights off, get the weed sack
Cut the mic on, let the beats tat
You gon' make a dope nigga relapse
Don't get your show close
Like concerts, nigga we clap
My shows, they be packed
Nigga where the fuck you see seats at?
If they try to come and get the chicken
I'mma make you show you where the beef at
Money long like marathons
Came a long way from the avalon
Crew said, got a new cheque
Got the blue chair by the avatar
Number ones in the catalogue
She was fun but I had 'em all
Doing lines in the bathroom
In the classroom, she like Adderall
I'm a dog, yeah that a boy
That a Porsche, nah that a toy
Nigga roll like I'm at a dump
I be on my bullshit
No bullshit with the metaphors
All I ever used to ever want
Want a Lexus, nah nigga I got shoes now
6 bedroom crib turned into 5
Cause there's room for shoes now
Granddaddy used to grind
Making moneshine, got my own bulls now
I be tryna make a move
Let 'em make a move, I could never lose now

[Hook: MIKExANGEL]
They said I would never be shit
They said I was never gonna amount to nothing
They said I would never make it
But guess what I did, look what I did, look what I did
Look what I did, look what I did
Look what I did, look what I did
Look what I did, look what I did
Look what I did, look what I did
