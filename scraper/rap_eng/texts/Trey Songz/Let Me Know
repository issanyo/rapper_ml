Songbook, baby

[Verse 1]
Hit your line the other day
Now I'ma search the world, baby
Talkin' 'bout you got a man
So you ain't got the time to play games
But I got the time today, let me show you a couple things
Like how to be the side piece, slide peace
Go back home and say his name, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I know you want to
Won't you come and slide through
Have you home by 5'ish
Tell me that you'd like to
If thats the case then you can stay just for the night
Hold you tight, love you down
'Cause I know your man don't do it right

[Chorus]
So, let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know-know-know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know-know-know
It's yes or a no, it's a go
Let me know
Let me know-know-know
Let me know-know-know

[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'd do if you lie to me
Tell a lie to dude, then get right to me
What he doesn't know can't hurt his feelings
Do what'chu gotta do just to get right to me
Ooooh, oooh
Know he don't love you right
Know he not touch you right
I'm just tryna come shed a little light, right?
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I know you want to
Won't you come and slide through
Have you home by 5'ish
Tell me that you'd like to
If thats the case then you can just stay for the night
Hold you tight, love you down
'Cause I know your man don't do it right

[Chorus]
So, let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know-know-know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know-know-know
It's yes or a no, it's a go
Let me know
Let me know-know-know
Let me know-know-know
Tell me how you feel baby

[Verse 3]
If you decide just for a night that you might want to roll
Keep it low (Keep low if you wanna roll, all you gotta do is let me know)
If you decide just for a night that you might want to roll
Keep it low (Let me know)
If you decide just for a night that you might want to roll
Keep it low (Keep it low)
If you decide just for a night that you might want to roll
Keep it low (Just let me know)

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I know you want to
Won't you come and slide through
Have you home by 5'ish
Tell me that you'd like to
If thats the case then you can just stay for the night
Hold you tight, love you down
'Cause I know your man don't do it right
Let me know, yeah, yeah
Just let me know, yeah, yeah
Just let me know, yeah
