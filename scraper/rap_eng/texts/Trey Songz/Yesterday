[Intro: Toni Braxton & Trey Songz]
Oh, oh
No, no
Ooh, Toni

[Verse 1: Toni Braxton]
I gave you the benefit of the doubt
'Til you showed me what you were about
Your true colors came out, oh
And your words couldn't hide the sin
'Cause the truth about where you been
Is in a fragrance I can't recognize

[Pre-Chorus: Toni Braxton]
Just standing there, scratching your head
Bloodshot eyes, drunk with regret
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge
I'm done with this, feeling like an idiot
Loving you, I'm over it
I just don't love you, don't love you no more

[Chorus: Toni Braxton]
You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay
See you, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
I don't wanna hear a thing you say
You're so yesterday

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Baby, what you're saying to me is
There's no more you and I
I couldn't get it right on yesterday
So kiss our tomorrows goodbye
Baby, love should brought me home
Should've just been a man about it
But now I'm crying like a baby
Girl, your love was like my blanket
Don't know what to do without it

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & Toni Braxton]
I'm standing here, pleading my case
You don't care to hear what I say
Hanging yourself ten feet over the edge, oh no, baby
My promises don't mean nothing
The end is so disgusting
I just don't love you, don't love you no more

[Chorus: Toni Braxton & Trey Songz]
You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay
Honey, you, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
I don't wanna hear a thing you say, so yesterdayy

[Bridge: Toni Braxton & Trey Songz]
And now you wanna reminisce, say you wanna try again
It started with a little kiss but we can't even be friends
No, no, now I never wanna see you, never wanna feel you, never wanna hear you
I don't love you, don't need you, can't stand you no more

[Chorus: Toni Braxton & Trey Songz]
You, you are so yesterday
Never thought you'd lose my love this way
Now you come begging me to stay
You, you are so yesterday
I won't let you rain on my parade
I don't wanna hear a thing you say, so yesterdayy
So yesterday, so yesterday
So yesterday, so yesterday
Just because of yesterday
So yesterday, so yesterday
So yesterday, so yesterday
