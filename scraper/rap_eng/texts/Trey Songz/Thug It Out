[Intro - Trey Songz]
Aye, Ya'll niggas stop talking all that shit in the club man

[Chorus - Trey Songz]
It ain't a problem we can thug it out
(Your hood, my hood)
Come show me what you talking 'bout (talking 'bout)
(Right here what's good)
Ain't a problem so just watch your mouth
(Talk tough til' we)
Erase your face and take you out (take you out)
It ain't a problem

[Verse 1 - Jay Rock]
Back in the days
Unfortunately a lot of real niggas being replaced
With all the official niggas that put frowns on their faces
Every time the m's come on they perpetrating
I guess I grew up different
I can't blame them, my childhood had to evolve around killers
Gangs and drug dealers, weed and cocaine
Which eventually made me who I am today
So I don't pay attention to 'em
I don't ever listen to 'em
I just brush off their loud talk
Play the background waiting for something to pop off
Watch the same nigga run to his car
Lame nigga never saw guns before
Be the same nigga talk about his guns to blow
He be considered a joke
When the hot ovens come out, it's life or death
Cutthroat niggas run back to their mom's house
You scared nigga

[Chorus - Trey Songz]

[Verse 2 - Jay Rock]
White [?] on the ride
Model bitch on the side
On my lap 4-5
Nigga that's how I drive
On these streets homeboy it's do or die
You wouldn't know because you never came outside
The wise man said actions speaks louder than words
And you clown niggas working my nerves
Hop in the booth and say you put work on the curb
Guns in the hood but never took a [?] on the turf
Never mention that when you rapping your verse
Nah, act tough when you yap on the chirp
Ain't that some shit your homies come around and you act like you run shit
Then wanna question my gangsta up on some dumb shit
Don't do that, we won't shoot where your legs is at
It's either your head or the area where your head pledging at
No allegiance, now breathing under God
Bitch

[Chorus - Trey Songz]

[Verse 3 - Jay Rock]
It's funny how these niggas be so hard on a record
See 'em in the streets, these niggas be soft as a feather
Yeah the ones that be in the club and they get their chain snatched
We play for keeps so I doubt they get their chain back
Plus the ones that talk tough behind the microphone
Be the first niggas to run when the fight is on
Them niggas scary and it's easy to see
I ain't calling out names, got caller ID
Niggas want beef boy you know where I be
In G projects, 112 street look
Don't need to check my resume nigga I'm good
B.L double O D nigga I'm hood
Lifting weights think he solid as a rock
Bet I knock his ass down from a .45 shot
So don't talk shit homie when you know your a ho
Like the good Bible say boy you reap what you sow
Bitch nigga

[Chorus - Trey Songz]
