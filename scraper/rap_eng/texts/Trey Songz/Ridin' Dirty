[Intro: Paul Wall]
Yuh, know what I'm talkin' 'bout
We over here in the grid iron, three in the mornin'
This song here is dedicated to all them boys that put it down before us
The foundation, know what I'm talkin' 'bout

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Pimpin' hoes, slammin' Cadillac doors
Shawty, understand this is how we roll
Parkin' lot pimpin' on 4's
VA to H-Town, yeah you already know
Choppin' on blades so amazin'
Look at them boy's teeth, that's crazy
The lean and the weed got us lazy
Yellow boppers is boppin' but you already know

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
I'm comin' straight out of the South, with my nuts in my hand
It's the SwishaHouse, the third coast, the state of Texas, that's my land
Who's the man that's in demand? It's Paul Wall baby yeah that's me
I put it down on that Gov Bang, but now I reside on that South Lee
And I'm hustlin', on the grind, seventy two, I was straight
No time to eat or sleep, I'm stackin' licks that just won't wait
I'm campaignin' for a new Benz, on the rims with bubble lens
So I'm stackin' every dollar I see, hundreds, fifties, twenties and tens
Doors open and doors close, never sweat hoes, players get chose
Hustle and flow, cars close, that's the player life that I know
Roll the dank up, where's the 'dro, pour the drank up, where's the fo'
Stackin' money all on the low and we still ridin' dirty, pimpin'

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Pimpin' hoes, slammin' Cadillac doors
Shawty, understand this is how we roll
Parkin' lot pimpin' on 4's
VA to H-Town, yeah you already know
Choppin' on blades so amazin'
Look at them boy's teeth, that's crazy
The lean and the weed got us lazy
Yellow boppers is boppin' but you already know

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
I'm ridin' drop top on them roller skates, candy Charlie ranch'n paint
Enjoyin' the spoils of hard work, in grind mode tryna get that bank
I don't know what these boys thank, my motivation is Benjamin Franklin
I'm tryna maintain this wealth that I been calculatin'
Gettin' money, that's all I know, on my toes, never off my note
Woodgrain and hundred spokes, I weigh the trunk just like a pro
I grind, it's off to work I go, I hustle hard, it's non-stop
And if I flop, I switch the hustle, I learn the game and then set-up shop
I'm strivin' to make it to the top, it's all or nothin', no turnin' back
I'm with them boys out on the block, accumulatin' them paper stacks
I'm makin' money it's where it's at, whatever it takes, crackerjack
In love with my money and that's a fact and we still ridin' dirty, pimpin'

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Pimpin' hoes, slammin' Cadillac doors
Shawty, understand this is how we roll
Parkin' lot pimpin' on 4's
VA to H-Town, yeah you already know
Choppin' on blades so amazin'
Look at them boy's teeth, that's crazy
The lean and the weed got us lazy
Yellow boppers is boppin' but you already know

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Right now we got the fifth wheel reclinin'
Trunk is popped up, screens fallin' from the sky
I got the candy paint sprayed by Eddie
And I'm ridin' on that glassy chrome, all courtesy of my hustle gang
Be a hustler's in my bloodline, I don't complain or whine
I just get on my grind, puttin' in work overtime
I learned overtime, many hustles of every kind
Whatever it takes to make a dime, I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind, but now I see the road to riches
It's a long road, full of hurdles, potholes and ditches
Bernard Freeman taught me to keep it movin' when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me to keep it trill at all cost
I peeped game from the best and since then I been playin' chess
I put in work with no rest, to get that paper that's my quest
I'm on a slow grind towards success, one of the best 'cause I keep it fresh
I'm one hundred and nothin' less and I'm still ridin' dirty, pimpin'

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Pimpin' hoes, slammin' Cadillac doors
Shawty, understand this is how we roll
Parkin' lot pimpin' on 4's
VA to H-Town, yeah you already know
Choppin' on blades so amazin'
Look at them boy's teeth, that's crazy
The lean and the weed got us lazy
Yellow boppers is boppin' but you already know
