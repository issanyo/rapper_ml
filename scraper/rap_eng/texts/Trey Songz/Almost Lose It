[Verse 1]
The doors open and everybody turns around
To see you walk down the aisle in your pretty white gown
You're holding your daddy's arm, your tears begin to fall
And both of our lives are about to change forever
Everybody stands, she reaches out her hand
The preacher says, "We've gathered here today"

[Chorus]
And I, I almost lose it
When I hear you say "I do"
And I'm so in love with you
Baby, I almost lose it
When I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take

[Verse 2]
I wonder if she's nervous or will she get cold feet
She wears a smile as the diamond shines from her wedding ring
I hope it's everything you wanted, you deserve the best
Always knew I'd be the reason for your wedding dress
So beautiful, the way you read your vows
Then the wedding bells ring

[Chorus]
And I, I almost lose it
When I hear you say "I do"
And I'm so in love with you
Baby, I almost lose it
When I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take

[Bridge]
As the tears roll down your cheek, it's impossible for me to speak
My heart is beating fast and my knees are feeling weak
So speak now or forever hold your peace
Can't help but wonder from my seat, if he knows you were meant for me

[Chorus]
And I, I almost lose it
When I hear you say "I do"
And I'm so in love with you
Baby, I almost lose it
When I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take

[Outro]
Can't help but wonder from my seat if he knows
Does he know you are meant for me?
Do you know? Can't help but wonder
You know, you are meant for me girl
And if you didn't know, that you are, you are
And I, I almost lose it
