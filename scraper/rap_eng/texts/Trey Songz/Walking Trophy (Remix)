[Intro: HoodCelebrityy & Fabolous]
I ain't playin' with you
Walking, walking, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Trophy, trophy, yeah
You a walking trophy
Remix, remix

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I see you got a tan from the islands, skin look golden
Spice it up on them niggas
I see you been heatin' up the IG, ass look swollen
Ice you up on them niggas
I see you know how to hit them angles, pose you been holdin'
Price went up on them niggas
This time I let them see you a bad bitch, see you a rude girl
Nice for what to them niggas? (the remix)
You wear a trophy, B
You with the winning team
You never with a loser, unless it's in his stream
You got a glow with you, you got an inner beam
You make the opps want you, even a friend'll scheme
Them niggas wanna kiss the trophy too
But a real nigga wouldn't of been overdue
They been tryna shoot they shot, they like O for 2
And I'm KD for 3, shootin' over you (uh)

[Chorus: HoodCelebrityy]
Gyal yuh know seh yuh pretty from yuh born
Walk out gyal, yuh nah try hard
Dem gyal dem nuh pretty inna real life
You pretty pon di 'gram

Yuh body look good set right (set right)
Yuh ting tun up pussy well tight (well tight)
Batty clean, nah nuh cellulite
An' yuh skin jus' a glow like peppa light

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Yeah girl you a winner, you a winner, you a winner
Caribbean girl, you a stone cold killer
Gyal way I'm looking at your body, I'm a sinner
Yeah I love looking at that body while I'm all up in, all up in her head
I can't get you out my head
Girl you wicked in the bed
I can take you to LA
We go shopping for the day
I'm spending it all on you, girl
Spending it all on you anyway
Dancehall vibes close the [?] of the night
My crib close by we go we could like
Hood girl tell me it's a go for tonight
Baby girl you got the glow in the lights
