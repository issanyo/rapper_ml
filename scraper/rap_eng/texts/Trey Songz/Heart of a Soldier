[Hook: Trey Songz]
I've got the heart of a solider, I've got the soul of a tiger
Whoever said I'm scared, you's motherfuckin' liar
I've got the eye of an eagle, I've got the back of my people
I done bust my share of heads, don't you ever say you're scared

[Verse 1: Ebony Eyez]
See a lot of motherfuckers fall, when they back get pressed up against the wall, not me homie
Wish a motherfucker would, think he could come and take what's mines, let him try and he gon' see
He gon' get tugged, leave him shriveled like a raisin with no hesitation
Too late for the conversation, time wastin', send them to their final destination
Don't give a fuck, let the middle finger, linger, to them rat clowns
Ain't the type that will back down, bet you'll get slapped down, you better check my motherfuckin' background
Name only get around like rumors, never let the haters consume us
Leave a bitch with a head full of tumors, if she ever thinkin' of steppin' up to us
I'll show and prove, I'll annihilate a bitch that'll violate this here
Never seen me shed a tear, out of fear, bring chaos in a minute to a motherfucker, yessir
I'm from the Lou and it's too late now dirty, they don' got me started
And you can't abort it 'cause see, a bitch like me is just to cold-hearted

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I've got the heart of a solider, I've got the soul of a tiger
Whoever said I'm scared, you's motherfuckin' liar
I've got the eye of an eagle, I've got the back of my people
I done bust my share of heads, don't you ever say you're scared

[Verse 2: Ebony Eyez]
Now you can say what you wanna 'bout me 'cause the truth really don't, it only make me stronger
Think I give a fuck 'bout how you sayin' how I lookin' a video, bitch, couldn't be wronger
I know you mad, better find your position and learn how to play it
Don't you hate it when a hater hatin' on your situation 'cause they wack ass never made it?
Bitch you and bad, you better watch your mouth, 'for I watch your house and
Have a nigga come and rock your spouse and leave 'em quiet as a mouse when the lights go out and
Your days is over, so don't make no plans, you don' had your chance and
I'm 'bout to lock this bitch down and throw away the key, 'matter fact even snatch your fans and
I'm takin' over, comin' through with a vengeance 'bout to get intense
Did I forget to mention a lot of this tension 'cause your shit is comin' to an end and
Every time that Ebony rhymes, every line, I make a motherfuckin' pause and drop their jaws
Start sweatin' like they havin' a heat stroke like they goin' through menopause and love shittin' they draws

Don't you ever say you're scared
