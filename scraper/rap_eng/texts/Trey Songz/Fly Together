[Intro: Trey Songz]
Songz, Jones
Songbook, baby
And my boy E Hud
You already know
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Maybe it's the dude, maybe it's the cool
Maybe it's my shoes, call 'em 22's
Baby it's ya phase, baby it;'s ya face
Baby it;s ya smile, make me wonder how you taste
Maybe 'cause the thugs say that I'm cool
Maybe 'cause the girls wanna be like you
Maybe it's the ice that made ya look twice
Maybe it's ya back that made me look back

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Baby, I'd look good with you
You should know that you'd look good with me too
Let me ride through the hood with you
Show you to my boys 'cause ooh ooh you

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You so fly, I'm so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together
I'm so fly, you so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Maybe take a cruise, sail across seas
We can never lose, baby not we
We can be the two, true life of the party
Baby, what it do? You know that you want me
Maybe it's the feel that I like you
Got a nigga feel he can wife you
Maybe it's the fit that made me look slick
Baby, you the pick, I make you my chick

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
Baby, I'd look good with you
You should know that you'd look good with me too
Let me ride through the hood with you
And show you to my boys 'cause ooh ooh you

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You so fly, I'm so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together
I'm so fly, you so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Baby don't, don't you take too long, I want you in my arms
And if you feel what I feel, bring it here to me c'mon
See we young but girl, we grown
And baby I want to grow old with you 'cause you know that you so

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
Maybe it's ya attitude that makes me a lil mad at you
The same time the gratitude makes me wanna spend cash on you
Take you on trips, you caught the longitude and latitude
Let you hold the whip, last time we almost crashed the coupe
So I laughed at you, 'cause we was drunk pissy
It was two summers ago and you still rollin' with me
But maybe it;s the loyalty, the way that you callin' me
When we makin' love, when you scream, put it all on me
Or maybe my physique and my upcomin' from the streets
I keeps you runnin' back, I got you cumin' in the sheets
From the first time I met you, you become a little freak
I might go downtown and get somethin' to eat
And baby, you took care of me, baby, I took care of you
You cry I cry, baby, I shed tears for two
Baby if the 7 karats didn't cost 300 grand
I would had the table and put some ice on ya hand

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You so fly, I'm so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together
I'm so fly, you so fly
What's more fly than you and I together?
Get high, let's fly together

[Outro: Trey Songz]
I'm so, you so, we so fly
I'm so, you so, we so fly
Get high, let's fly together
