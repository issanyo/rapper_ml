[Intro]
Ay, I just got a idea
You know
Thinking of some things we could do, spice things up
For sure

[Verse 1]
If I snuck up in your bedroom, touch you while you sleep
Would you act surprised as if you didn't know it's me?
I came to steal your heart, girl, don't call the police
I only want a part, girl, really just a piece
If you show me the money, then I'm gon' show you the beast
If you give me your honey, girl, I promise I'll be sweet
Then, I'm gon' sneak out the back, so nobody will notice me
Then we can run it back girl, it's your turn to go on me, we can

[Chorus]
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way

[Verse 2]
The room is spinning ridiculous, my body freezing cold
I can't even remember what I did the night before
I don't know where I am, girl, but I gotta go
I can't feel my legs, somebody help
If you come in and rescue me, I don't know what to do
I say I need a remedy, you say the cure is you
Then you tell me relax and get ready for surgery
Baby, fix me fast, you know it's an emergency

[Chorus]
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way

[Bridge]
You got your picture in your mind, let me see
Now that we're together, girl
Don't be shy, now, it's alright, you'll start to see
Show me your direction, girl
You got your picture in your mind, let me see
Now that we're together, girl
Don't be shy, now, it's alright, you'll start to see
Show me your direction, girl

[Chorus]
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way

[Outro]
Role play, role play, you can have it your way
Role play, role play, I can have it my way
Role play, role play, I can have it my way
Role play, role play, you can have it your way
Role play, babe
Role play, babe
