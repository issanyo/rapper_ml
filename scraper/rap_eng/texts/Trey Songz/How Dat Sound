[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Tell me, how that sound? (Ooh, ooh)
How that sound? How that sound?
You tellin' me wait for later
Well, look baby don't you know? I want you now
How that sound? (How that sound, how that sound?)
Them other girls don't compare, this ain't fair, you the baddest one around
How that sound? Got my hands on your body (Yeah)
How that sound? Got some bands for the party (Yeah)
Stick around, baby sit that ass down
Stick around, baby stick that ass out
Stick around, baby sit that ass down
Stick around, baby stick that ass out (Yeah)
(Yeah, stick that ass out)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
(2 Chainz!)
You don't have to get up lil' baby
I got me a butler to clean up the palace
Oops, I mean to say palace
Just follow the money and that is my address
Oops, now here come the madness (Madness)
I'm doin' lay-up lines with the atlas
I take a girl out to eat, then I feed her to the mattress
Turn her over, have her eatin' the mattress
Turn her over, have her bein' dramatic
Havin' sex wearin' a black Patek
Fat ass got me asthmatic
Droppin' ashes on the marble floor
Was in the Hall like Arsenio (Arsenio)
Walked in the garage and I say "eenie, meenie miney, moe"
I'll take you or you (Ugh,) all this loot I blew (Ugh)
All the shit I do (Ugh,) need a pooper scoop (Ugh)
How that shit sound? (How that shit sound?) Still won't sit down (I'm a standup nigga)
I have always been outside of the in-crowd

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Tell me, how that sound? (Ooh, ooh)
How that sound? How that sound?
You tellin' me wait for later
Well, look baby don't you know? I want you now
How that sound? (How that sound, how that sound?)
Them other girls don't compare, this ain't fair, you the baddest one around
How that sound? Got my hands on your body (Yeah)
How that sound? Got some bands for the party (Yeah)
Stick around, baby sit that ass down
Stick around, baby stick that ass out

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Yeah girl, you know that body psycho (Um, yeah)
Ooh you know you Bad, shouts to Michael (Um, yeah)
Beat the pussy up like I'm Micheal (Um, yeah)
Eat the pussy out like a rice bowl
Oh yeah, that's perfect, work it, twerk it like a lady, yeah
Ooh yeah bae, you my fave, you my favorite
Oh yeah, that's perfect, work it, twerk it like a lady, yeah
Ooh yeah bae, you my fave, you my favorite

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Tell me, how that sound? (Ooh, ooh)
How that sound? How that sound?
You tellin' me wait for later
Well, look baby don't you know? I want you now
How that sound? (How that sound, how that sound?)
Them other girls don't compare, this ain't fair, you the baddest one around
How that sound? Got my hands on your body (Yeah)
How that sound? Got some bands for the party (Yeah)
Stick around, baby sit that ass down
Stick around, baby stick that ass out
Stick around, baby sit that ass down

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
I want you now, not later
Baby, let's create some haters (Make 'em mad)
I want to fuck you forever (forever)
But I ain't signin' no papers (Can't do it)
I blew a bag at Aces
Ended up fuckin' a waitress
Every whip I ever had was white (On white)
Niggas thought I was racist (Racist)
Foreign dealer in the trap
Shawty don't like rappers
Bitch, I'm a gangster I just rap (Me neither)
She only send pictures through Snap (Wooh!)
Boss bitches got boss niggas
Lost bitches like lost niggas
You a weird ho, you fuckin' weirdos
On some real shit, I know a few of those

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Tell me, how that sound? (Ooh, ooh)
How that sound? How that sound?
You tellin' me wait for later
Well, look baby don't you know? I want you now
How that sound? (How that sound, how that sound?)
Them other girls don't compare, this ain't fair, you the baddest one around
How that sound? Got my hands on your body (Yeah)
How that sound? Got some bands for the party (Yeah)
Stick around, baby sit that ass down
Stick around, baby stick that ass out
Stick around, baby sit that ass down
Stick around, baby stick that ass out
(Yeah)
Stick that ass out
