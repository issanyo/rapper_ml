[Intro]
Listen, you gotta stop blaming yourself

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta change, I do, I do, I do
Playing all the games I do, I do, I do
I'm willing to change for you, it's true, so true
'Cause you ain't gotta change, I do, I do

[Verse 1]
It's been on your heart, been on my mind
I'll take the blame 'cause I know it's mine
You've been there from the start, right by my side
You think it's your fault, we're at the finish line
Every time you've forgive me
I wonder why you stay with me
Promise, broken promises
Left you broken hearted

[Chorus]
That's why you ain't gotta change, I do, I do, I do
Playing all the games I do, I do, I do
I'm willing to change for you, it's true, so true
'Cause you ain't gotta change, I do, I do

[Verse 2]
Said if you leave, I'll be hopeless waiting for you
Shortly, you'll see, I'll be crying for you
I know I ain't right, you know I ain't right
But you know it's worth it when it's deeper than the surface, girl
Life without your blessings, that'll sure teach me my lesson
Don't know why you're stressing, girl, when you're perfection

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta change, I do, I do, I do
Playing all the games I do, I do, I do
I'm willing to change for you, it's true, so true
'Cause you ain't gotta change, I do, I do

[Outro]
Listen to me, I do
I swear I'm tryna change babe, woah
