Every single day, girl, I wanna
Get away, If your love's, gonna
Come along, girl, when we together
I be feeling so strong
But when we're apart
I don't know where to start

You've been nothing short of perfect
Baby, I've been trynna make it worth it
When you say, that you love me
Girl, you make me feel invincible

Baby, you know my love ain't gon' go no where
And I know the only thing thats pumping through my veins, is you
You know I'm only living for your love
You see I hit the ground runnin'
Searchin' for your love
And I'll never run from it, I promise
I won't survive, without it
I'll flatline
'Cause girl my heart beats for you
I won't survive (for you)
It beats for you (I won't survive)
(for you) Girl my heart beats for you
I won't survive
And I will never run from it, I promise
It beats for you

Ohhh
My heart only beats for you
Only for you, girl, ohh

Eh, Eh, Eh, Girl
Just the thought of you leavin'
Makes me feel the pain, girl
And no medication can make it go away, girl
My body's feeling cold
My heart is feelin' froze
Need your healin', here we go

You know, my love ain't gon' go no where
So beautiful, hold me tight, don't ever let me go

'Cause, you know I'm only livin' for your love
I hit the ground runnin'

Searchin' for your love
And I'll never run from it, I promise
I won't survive,(without it)
I'll flatline
'Cause Girl, my heart beats for you
I won't survive (for you)
It beats for you (I won't survive)
(For you) Girl my heart beats for you
(I won't survive) My heart beats for you
And I will never run from it, I promise, It beats for you
You see, I hit the ground runnin'
Searchin' for your love
And I'll never run from it
I promise (I won't survive, without it)
I'll flatline
Cause, Girl my heart beats for you
(I won't survive) (for you) It beats for you
(I won't survive) Cause girl my heart beats for, (I won't survive), for you
It beats for you, I won't survive
And I will never run from it, I promise
It beats for youuu

It beats for you, (only you)
Your love runs through my veins
Girl, it is not a game and I won't be the same
If you would go away
And your love wasn't here to stay
Down on my knees I pray
That you wait for me

Hit the ground runnin'
Searchin' for your love
And I will never run from it, I promise
I won't survive, without it
I'll flatline
'Cause girl, my heart beats for you
(I won't survive) for you
It beats for you
I won't survive (for you)
It beats for you, (I won't surive)
And I'll never run from it, I promise
