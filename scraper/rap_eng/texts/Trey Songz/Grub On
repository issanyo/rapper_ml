[Intro]
Damn, I'm so hungry
Plus I'm laying
What time is it?
I'll tell you what

[Verse 1]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning and the club is over
Shawty let's go get our grub on
I had way too much to drink and I need to get sober
So, let's go get our grub on
Baby, let's get out of here, I know a place not far from here
That I can get that grub on
Said my stomach's growling so crazy, would you please feed me baby?
Girl, let me get my grub on
No cheese steak or grits, I don't have a taste for that
I don't want pancakes or bacon, I don't have a taste for that
Girl, I want something fulfilling, that's gon' fill my appetite
Girl, you're the only one that can make it alright

[Chorus]
Will you be my IHOP baby? Can I place my order?
The food in here is crazy, twenty-four hours
'Round the clock you open, baby, here's a tip
You hop on top of me, I hop on top of you

[Verse 2]
I'm thinking 'bout going for seconds, maybe some dessert, Yeah
I'm still tryna get my grub on
And when I taste ya coffee with sugar and cream
This spot is where I belong oh
Cake and whip cream so divine, I could eat here all the time
Is there a doggy bag I could take home?
Telling you if you ain't tasted, think you better call your waitress
'Cause IHOP's open 'til the early morn
No fruitcakes, no salads, I don't have a taste for that
Looking for a meal with a balance, something that can satisfy me
Girl, I want something fulfilling, that's gon' take care of my cravings
So girl tell me can you feed me

[Chorus]
Will you be my IHOP baby? Can I place my order?
The food in here is crazy, twenty-four hours
'Round the clock you open, baby, here's a tip
You hop on top of me, I hop on top of you

[Bridge]
I like that blueberry syrup, I like that strawberry syrup
Now baby lay your body down and let me lick it all up
Now baby let's get you seated, don't need a plate to whoo
Get a good meal, let me show you girl, it's real
But it's gon' be just me and you
We gon' grub 'til we full, so tell me it's cool

[Chorus]
Will you be my IHOP baby? Can I place my order?
The food in here is crazy, twenty-four hours
'Round the clock you open, baby, here's a tip
You hop on top of me, I hop on top of you
Will you be my IHOP baby? Can I place my order?
The food in here is crazy, that's twenty-four hours
'Round the clock you open, I'll give you a big tip
You hop on top of me, I hop on top of you

[Outro]
Now gimme that rootie-tootie
That fresh and fruity
That, that, that big ol' booty
Now come and do me
Grub on, grub on
Grub on, grub on
