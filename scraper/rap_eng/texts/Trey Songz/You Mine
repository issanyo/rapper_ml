[Chorus: Jeremih]
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine
Bring your body here
You've been workin' out lookin' so right, so it's only right
Yeah, you know how we get it
It's growin' up, I know you down to ride, you know what's on tonight
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
You know when I'm opposite of you
It drives me so fuckin' crazy
Got my head between your legs, kissin' on your favorite places
Girl, you make a mess, how you got me makin' sticky faces
You like to get gone off of that liq'
One more shot, one more sip, you get so into it, girl
I bet the neighbors, bet they know us
Pussy bomb when you cum, girl you blow up, girl, yeah
And other niggas can't do nothin' for ya, yeah
I pledge you mine, you know you keep me focused
Said them other niggas stop wastin' their time
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine

[Chorus: Jeremih & Trey Songz]
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine
Bring your body here
You've been workin' out lookin' so right, so it's only right
Yeah, you know how we get it
It's growin' up, I know you down to ride, you know what's on tonight
(Tell them niggas) you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine

[Verse 2: Future]
Dress it up and make it real for me
Then tell me you gon' kill for me
Then tell me you gon' steal for me
Then tell me you gon' steal from me
I just had walked in the mall like I'm Puffy
Then I said give me the total
I went to Harlem and get me a Spanish bitch
She dressed like a mannequin
I went to Baltimore, got me a ghetto bitch
'Cause I've been livin' so lavishly
She fuckin' me good, she roll up my blunt
She even hang 'round all my savages
I put the time in, got the Rollie hangin' off her
Like I'm gon' marry her
I know it's love, I know it's love
'Cause she hang around all my shooters
I walked in the club, I walked in the club
I told that bitch hold on the Ruger
Even them gangster niggas love ya like Larry Hoover
I just sent her off to shop her daughter in the Uber
She know the shit that I told her
Was some of the realest shit ever been told

[Chorus: Jeremih & Trey Songz]
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine
Bring your body here
You've been workin' out lookin' so right, so it's only right
Yeah, you know how we get it
It's growin' up, I know you down to ride, you know what's on tonight
(Tell them niggas) you mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine, you mine
You mine, you mine, you mine

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
