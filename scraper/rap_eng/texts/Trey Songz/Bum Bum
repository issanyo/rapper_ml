[Verse 1: Kat DeLuna]
If you wanna love me, you gotta do it right
'Cause every Queen need a King who wants her body, all day, all night

[Pre-Chorus: Kat DeLuna]
We could do it in the shower
We could do it on the floor
You could get it every hour
Boy, there's so much more

[Chorus: Kat DeLuna & Trey Songz]
Bum bum, from where this came from
If you love this bum bum
It's the only one you want
What a bum bum
How could I replace that, bum bum?
I just wanna see you shake that, bum bum
Give it to me, I'ma take that, bum bum
What a bum bum

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Shawty came in and she caught me red handed staring at her butt
So I say what's up
If I get it, I ain't losing it
'Cause I know what to do with it
Make you say oh
This is the love you've been waiting for
We've come too far so when I get close
Ain't nobody touching your body but me

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & Kat DeLuna]
We could do it in the shower
We could do it on the floor
You could get it every hour
Know there's so much more

[Chorus: Kat DeLuna & Trey Songz]
Bum bum, from where this came from
If you love this bum bum
It's the only one you want
What a bum bum
How could I replace that, bum bum?
I just wanna see you shake that, bum bum
Give it to me, I'ma take that, bum bum
What a bum bum

[Bridge: Kat DeLuna & Trey Songz]
I know you love it when I shake it, shake
You know I love it when you shake it for me
Go hard but don't break it, break
Don't worry, I ain't taking no breaks
Baby let me see it, shake
Let me see it, shake
Let, let me see it, shake
Let me see it, shake
Let me see it, shake
Let me see it, shake
Let me see it, shake
Let me see it, shake
Oh, boy there's so much more

[Chorus: Kat DeLuna & Trey Songz]
Bum bum, from where this came from
If you love this bum bum
It's the only one you want
What a bum bum
How could I replace that, bum bum?
I just wanna see you shake that, bum bum
Give it to me, I'ma take that, bum bum
What a bum bum

[Outro: Trey Songz & Kat DeLuna]
Bum, bum, I love, I love, woah
One thing, one thing, what a bum yeah
One thing, one thing, what a bum yeah
