[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
You love me like words can't explain
For me to feel the same is all you wanna gain
You never claim that the dollars made me change
But the models giving brain
Guess that could get your brain

Hurt your heart in the worst way
Never shoulda let you fall in the first place
But you've fallen, put your all in
Now you're so high off love you don't wanna get down

Most nights she ain't sleep
Worried where I might or I might not be
Sheesh...! For the life of me
Man what a life I lead

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You kept me on this pedestal
No matter how much I let you down (down, I let you down, down, down)
With all my infidelity
You loved me so incredibly
Inside I'll fall apart
If you ever love someone instead of me (instead of me)
So you deserve a better man (instead of me, instead of me)

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Clock won't stop (tick, tock)
Her love is going, going, going by the minute
Going, going, going, she keep giving

But I know she can't take it
Still her heart I keep breaking
So I'mma let her love go
Cause I don't deserve her love no more

Sad story
She mad for me
And mad at me
Sad that we
Can't exude love
Not a true love
Cause it's all screwed up

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You kept me on this pedestal
No matter how much I let you down (down, I let you down, down, down)
With all my infidelity
You loved me so incredibly
Inside I'll fall apart
If you ever love someone instead of me

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
How do you fix a love undone
How you even know if you're fit to love someone
And when you decide to take that ride
Can you drive from the passengers side
One wheel in the middle
Four hands on it
Two sets of breaks
You decide to slam on it
God damn woman
Where the love go
Whip crash will you get whiplash
Sit back cause you won't get shit back
But think if you tried to get what you just had back
She mad at facts
And you can't be mad at that
You can't be mad at that
(You can't be mad at that)

[Bridge]
Clock won't stop, tick-tock (2x)

[Outro]
You kept me on this pedestal
No matter how much I let you down (I let you down)
