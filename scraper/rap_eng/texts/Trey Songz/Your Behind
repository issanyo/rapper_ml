[Verse One]
Its so unsual to me
How I can see
That thang you got
From the the back
To the front
Its so beautilful to me
Girl you see
This dream I got
You'd be walking all through it
The way you do it

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah

[Verse Two]
And all I see
Is you on top of me
Watching you ride
Looking to my eyes
All I need is to be inside
I'll be sliding in the front
Going to the behind

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah

[Verse Three - Birdman]
Aye that girl so big
Aye that girl so phat
Aye the girl so big
Aye that girl so phat
Why is your back bone bigger that the usual
Little mama why you so phat
How long did it take that thang to grow
I'd love to hit that front the back
Me and my cut cuts
You and your gut guts
Rub on your butt butt
Diggin' your gut guts
And you already-dy
Put some pounds on the d d

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind yeah
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see ur behind
