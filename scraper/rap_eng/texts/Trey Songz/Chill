[Intro]
Yeah yeah, uh huh
Yeah yeah, uh huh

[Verse 1]
Can we get started? I just wanna turn you out, we should leave this party
Go some place where them clothes come off and I can see that body
Shots got my head spinning round and round, round and round
How many drinks will it take me to get you alone babe?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause a girl like you deserves affection when we're sexing
It's a blessing that you came so when you come through
You already know what's on my mind
We ain't gotta waste no time

[Chorus]
Come chill with a nigga, come chill with a nigga
I know we both gone off the liquor
But you should come chill with a nigga
Come chill baby, chill baby

[Verse 2]
Bumping, grinding all on the floor, know a nigga like that babe
If you 'bout it, come and ride it girl, fuck around and have my baby, yeah
I love it when you fight back, think I might wife that
Pussy got me going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause a girl like you deserves affection when we're sexing
It's a blessing that you came so when you come through
You already know what's on my mind
We ain't gotta waste no time

[Chorus]
Come chill with a nigga, come chill with a nigga
I know we both gone off the liquor
But you should come chill with a nigga
Come chill baby, chill baby

[Bridge]
Bring it over here, need you now, bring it over here, I treat you right
You know that you want to baby, tell we what you gon' do baby
I got something that you need, baby, please let me give it to ya
Ooh baby, when I'm chilling with ya
Chilling with a nigga but your clothes over there
Chilling with a nigga, got your booty in the air
Chilling with me, you won't wanna leave
When a nigga go deep, I'ma make you sing
You go
All them lames in your face
You ain't even gotta deal with them niggas
Keep it real with a nigga

[Chorus]
Come chill with a nigga, come chill with a nigga
I know we both gone off the liquor
But you should come chill with a nigga
Come chill baby, chill baby

[Beat switch]

[Outro]
So what's up?
The last thing I wanna do is pressure you, there's no pressure, just
Baby, we've been kicking it all night, we've been vibing, it just feels right
So if you ain't got nothing else to do, or if you cool with it, I just, you should come chill with a nigga
Hop up in the car, we ain't gotta go far
I know you wanna go, girl, come chill
And I've been kissing on your neck
Rubbing on your thighs, don't it feel right?
And now I got you thinking what, what if you give it up?
Would he tear that pussy down? Bet he beat that pussy up
Grabbing all that booty, still it's cute he thinking butt
Mind like probably but that body saying yup
She say come on, so we gon', we gon' play the crib
And if tomorrow never came, she can say she did
I got her literally feeling a nigga
So glad she came to chill with a nigga
