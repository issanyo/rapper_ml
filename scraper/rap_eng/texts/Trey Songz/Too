[Intro]
It's a movie, it's a movie, it's a movie
THRAXXX
It's your boy Lizzle
Don't let your bitch come see this movie
Please don't?
That might not be your bitch no more
Je m'appelle Ivy Leaguer

[Chorus]
My main bitch and my side bitch mad at me, I could give two fucks
Bout to drop a 4 all in my sprite, I need two cups
Rolling up dope, say you smoke too much
Hold up bitch, you don't smoke enough
She slowed down on this Activist
She can't have fun with you, she wanna go with us
Too much
Stacking up dough I got too much
Too much
Fucking on hoes, doing too much
Too much
Stunting on lames, doing too much
Too much
They say a young nigga do too much

[Verse 1]
He was looking for his lady took him too much
Pockets looking fatter than a tumor
Ruthâ€™s Chris, Blue Dolphin, your bitch be eating school lunch
These GSTAR jeans they too much
Shoes with the wings they too much
My Versace frames they too much
Any damn thing I do too much
I be bumping so much
I be drinking so much
That don't mean shit
I'll still smack a bitch if I'm sober
I just met the bitch, but I crushed the bitched like I know her
I don't hit the club unless they pay us to show up

[Chorus]
My main bitch and my side bitch mad at me, I could give two fucks
Bout to drop a 4 all in my sprite, I need two cups
Rolling up dope, say you smoke too much
Hold up bitch, you don't smoke enough
She slowed down on this Activist
She can't have fun with you, she wanna go with us
Too much
Stacking up dough I got too much
Too much
Fucking on hoes, doing too much
Too much
Stunting on lames, doing too much
Too much
They say a young nigga do too much

[Verse]
In the strip club I threw too much
Looking at you, you threw two bucks
She ain't looking at you, cause you ain't throw nothing
She looking at me, she wanna do something
I ain't even gotta spend no money
I bet you I'll still fuck
Cause my shoes, my shirt, my watch, and my jeans, and my chain cost too much
Everyday is Christmas
Bought a brand new 30 for my shooter
If you talking slick
Then pop pop
That's one and two to your medulla
Your family crying
Rest In Peace shirts
These motherfuckers doing too much
My shooter gone, he smoking dope
On a flight to Aruba

[Chorus]
My main bitch and my side bitch mad at me, I could give two fucks
Bout to drop a 4 all in my sprite, I need two cups
Rolling up dope, say you smoke too much
Hold up bitch, you don't smoke enough
She slowed down on this Activist
She can't have fun with you, she wanna go with us
Too much
Stacking up dough I got too much
Too much
Fucking on hoes, doing too much
Too much
Stunting on lames, doing too much
Too much
They say a young nigga do too much
