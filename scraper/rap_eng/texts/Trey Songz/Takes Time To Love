A material girl in her own world can't even see the things she's missing
Right in the curve, a little girl wanting to grow up and be a star
Take a look around without looking down
All these things have blurred your vision
Material things don't amount to nothing

But I know how you feel
It's hard to see who's real

It takes time living in a world
When you don't know who to trust
Next time slow it down
And don't feel you don't have to rush
It'll be fine, it takes time, takes time to love

Know I'ma tell the truth when it comes to you my lady
And it's miracle you have found a conscience baby
I hadn't planned on leaving you can't even give a reason
Now I know the reason why, why

But I know how you feel
It's hard to see who's real

It takes time living in a world
When you don't know who to trust
Next time slow it down
And don't feel you don't have to rush
It'll be fine, it takes time, takes time to love

No, love ain't in the money, love ain't in the cars
Love ain't in the jewellery, love ain't in the Mars
Perfect place to start searchin' is your heart
Just have patience

It takes time living in a world
When you don't know who to trust
Next time slow it down
And don't feel you don't have to rush
It'll be fine, it takes time, takes time to love

It takes time to love
It takes time to love
It takes time to love
