[Intro]
Is it really picture perfect?
Yeah, picture perfect
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I, I, I apologize for the times that he hurt you
Realize it, you know he don't deserve you
If you were mine, girl, I'd show you what you're worth
Look in my eyes, I'm so on it, he acting like he don't want it
I've been lurking and waiting, that shit irking my patience
I'm a savage, but I'm just trying some different shit lately
I don't usually have to wait in line
What you doing to me? It's fucking with my mind
Goddamn, I gotta see your ass online
Girl, again and again
With that other guy, goddamn
I know how it seems, but can you tell me just one thing?

[Chorus]
Is it really picture perfect? (Is it really picture perfect?)
Does that nigga serve a purpose? (Does that nigga serve a purpose?)
Is it really even working? (Is it really even working?)
'Cause underneath the surface, I can tell you're hurting
Is it really picture perfect? Uh
You got a nigga working (Is it really picture perfect?)
Got me out here tryna earn it, earn it (picture perfect)
Well I'ma wait my turn then, 'cause I know he gon' burn it
Is it really picture perfect? (Is it really picture perfect? yeah)
Is it really picture perfect? (Is it really picture perfect?)
Is it really picture perfect? (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I was tryna mind mine (yeah), staying off your timeline (yeah)
I'ma get right to the truth, I'm addicted to you, baby
I don't know what to do, baby, wish I never met you
'Cause ever since you came through, I been doing things that I never do, oh
I'm here and I just need to know if you can feel everything that I feel
I feel, like that thing you got, it ain't for real

[Chorus]
Is it really picture perfect? (Is it really picture perfect?)
Does that nigga serve a purpose? (Does that nigga serve a purpose?)
Is it really even working? (Is it really even working?)
'Cause underneath the surface (underneath the surface), I can tell you're hurting (I can tell)
Is it really picture perfect? (It don't seem like it)
Still you got a nigga working (I want you right here)
Got me out here tryna earn it, earn it (ooh)
Well I'ma wait my turn then 'cause I know he gon' burn it
Is it really picture perfect?
Oh na na na na na, I can't believe everything that I see
