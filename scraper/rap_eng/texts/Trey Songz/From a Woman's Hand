[Verse 1]
Tell me why when you put a camera on a thug
The first thing out of his mouth is I wanna thank my mama?
And some say that causes drama
But it's subliminal, there's no efforts needed
It's like pouring water on the ground that's seeded
And you know it happens all the time, so I need to ask this question

[Chorus]
Why oh why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand

[Verse 2]
Now tell me what turns a boy into a thug just as soon as he leave the house
See he don't have a man to give him little rules, so he don't be running in and out
But it's okay 'cause mama's there
And mama's doing the best she could ever do
But the funny thing is when it's all said and done
She probably did it better than you could ever do

[Chorus]
Why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand

[Bridge]
Tell me how will a boy learn to stand on his own?
How can he make it all alone? How can he be responsible?
If he don't have his daddy to show him how to be there
Not to minimize what his mama does for him
I'm just saying he gon' need ya'll both
Can you tell me why why why
Does it gotta be so hard to do a daddy's job?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be man

[Chorus]
Why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand
Why is it hard for dudes to always be around?
Tell me how can a boy be a man only getting fed from a woman's hands?
Tell me what do you think will happen when you don't come around?
It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man only getting fed from a woman's hand

[Outro]
When you missing his first game, don't even know the boy's nickname
That's a damn shame 'cause you suppose to be the man
The daddy, the father, the boy's role model
That's supposed to be you, that's supposed to be you
