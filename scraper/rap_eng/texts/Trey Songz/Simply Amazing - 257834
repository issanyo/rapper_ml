[Intro]
I, I can't really explain what is is she does
But um, yeah, whatever it's um, it is
Whatever it is It's simply amazing

[Verse:1]
Her head is on my chest
The sun comes rolling in
We're lost in these covers, and all I feel is skin
I slowly kiss your face, beautiful in every way
You are, you are

[Hook:1]
See I'm a man, that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
And how we play fight up in the bathroom
Next thing you know I'm making love to you
Girl, promise me you'll never change

[Chorus]
She ain't perfect, but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me, and it's simply amazing (you are)
Simply amazing (you are) simply amazing
And she loves me, and it's simply amazing
Amazing amazing

[Verse:2]
The girl's a work of art, and I can't help but stare
Got the smile like the sunset, and the ocean is her hair(ooh)
What she do ain't fair(ooh)
And she know me better, than I know myself,(mhmm)

[Hook:2]
See I'm a man that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I didn't believe in us
Like when I said I love you for the first time
And the tears dropped from your eyes
Girl, don't you ever change

[Chorus]

[Verse:3]
There is nothing, in this world
That can keep me away form you
And ain't nobody,(hey)
Who could ever compare to you, (whoa, oh)

[Chorus]
