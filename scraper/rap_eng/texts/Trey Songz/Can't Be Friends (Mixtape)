[Verse 1:]
Look what this girl done did to me*
She done cut me off from her good good love
She told me that those days are gone (gone, gone)
Now I'm sitting here going half crazy
Cause I know she still thinks about me too
And there ain't no way in hell
That I can just be friends with you (you, you)

[Chorus:]
And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends

[Verse 2:]
The way it felt, no faking it
Maybe we were moving just a little too fast
But what we've done we can't take it back (back, back)
Now I'm sitting here half way crazy
Cause I know she still thinks about me too
And there ain't no way in hell
That I can be just friends with you (you, you)

[Chorus:]
And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends
An all I can say is La La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La (la la la la ooo)
La La La La La La
Ain't no telling what we could have been (ain't no telling what we could of been nooo)

[Bridge:]
And if I knew we'd end like this
I never would of kissed you
Cause I fell in love with you
We never would of kicked it
Girl now everythings different
I lost my homie lover and my friend
That's why

[Chorus:]
And I wish we never did it
And I wish we never loved it (I wish we never loved it noo)
And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends
La La La La La La La La
La La La La La La La La La (la la la la ooo)
La La La La La La
Ain't no telling what we could of been
