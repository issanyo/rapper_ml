[Verse 1]
Tell me do you want the world and everything in it?
What kind of girl are you?
Or are you being for real, when you tell all your friends
Real love will do?

I don't have much money but I don't subscribe
To the notion every woman has a price
I don't have much game that you can see through
But if honesty's a quality I won't make a fool out of you

[Hook]
Put it on my life, won't make a fool out of you
Lady I'd rather die, than make a fool out of you
I'm not a perfect man but baby give me the chance
And my heart will be all yours

[Verse 2]
So what I gotta do to get to you? I'm willing
To be everything you ever dreamed, existed
Through the good and the bad
I wanna be the first and last, what you been missing

I don't have much money but I don't subscribe
To the notion every woman has a price
I don't have much game that you can see through
But if honesty's a quality

[Hook]
I won't make a fool out of you
Put it on my life, won't make a fool out of you
Lady I'd rather die, than make a fool out of you
I'm not a perfect man but baby give me the chance
And my heart will be all yours

[Verse 3]
Money can't buy you happiness
Especially if it leaves regrets
A connection and affection
Put it together baby it's a blessing
And a good heart is all you need

Baby I don't have much money but I don't subscribe
To the notion every woman has a price
I don't have much game that you can see through
But if honesty's a quality I won't make a fool out of you

[Hook]
Put it on my life, won't make a fool out of you
Lady I'd rather die, than make a fool out of you
I'm not a perfect man but baby give me the chance
And my heart will be all yours

I won't make a fool
