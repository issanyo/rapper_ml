But why can't you come with me tonight?
I know I'm too late
But let's roll one lay up for old time's sake, yeah, yeah
Roll up like we used to
Drop somethin', shake somethin', like you used to
Come through late night like you used to
Let me make you feel good like I used to
I just wanna love you like I used to
Hit you late night and you come through
I just wanna love you like I used to
Girl, you know you still my lil boo, boo

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]

I wanna kiss ya, don't you want some new shoes?

Who that? Hey stranger, how you feelin'?
Baby girl, we both know it's been a minute
We know our past is just history, still I know you been missin' me
And we both know you love when I'm in it
She like, "Hol' up, I can't, I got a new dude"
Swearin' up and down like it's a new you
I told her love who you love and I put some dick in your stomach
And she like, "Fuck it, nigga hit it like you used to"
She want that deja vu, we've been here before
Gon' make the neighbors hear her name that they already know
That's when the reefer and liquor turn into switchin' positions
Ay, exactly like it used to
