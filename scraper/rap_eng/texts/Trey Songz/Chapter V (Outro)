[Verse 1]
Girl, you ready, say you ready
Hope you're ready, know you ready
All I ask is when I'm in that thang, hold it steady , get it, get it, true freaks
Loose sheets, you gone wet it, make that pussy hurricane
Room spins like a tornado when that thunderstorm hit it
Bet if you caught amnesia this night you still won't forget it
Made a promise to ya body, kept my word, yeah I did it
Girl, it's on

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd like to welcome you to Chapter Five

Woah, woah, Chapter Five

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm on it, focused on it
Don't you want it? Know you want it

Know you lonely, know I only wanna

[Bridge]
Take you where you know you need to go
Swept you off your feet and now we on the floor
So many positions I know, I know, I know

[Chorus]
Bring your body, bring your body, bring your body here
'Bout to leave my name on it just to make it clear
Touch your body with my voice girl, give me your ear
Am I making myself clear? This is Chapter five

You say your man ain't there, no?
Slide me in and I'll make that pussy hurricane
This is Chapter five

Lay your body, bring your body, bring your body girl
Got ya body, I'ma treat it like it mean the world
