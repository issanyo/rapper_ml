I got two bitches twerkin', screamin' that's my best friend (her best friend)
Oh you better, you better, you better (girl)
I got two bitches twerkin', screamin' that's my best friend (her best friend)
Oh you better
You want her back? Then come and get her
And her best friend, her best friend, her best friend
You want her back? Then come and get her
And her best friend, her best friend
You better, you better

[Verse 1: J.R.]
I'm in my section popping bottles with two best friends
I can't tell who better, her or her best friend
Oh yeah, it's looking like tonight I'm fucking best friends
She eyeing me but kissing, fucking on her best friend
If you don't know, both them go, and they both get down whenever
Both these girls are freaks, but they nastier together
Get u one, i'll take a dose, it's a different kinda level
Real pimping 'bout to put them on a schedule

[Bridge: J.R.]
I can't keep these bitches off me (I can't)
And I ain't gonna stop her, look at how she's doing her partner
All she wanna do is party (Yeah that's all she want)
At the club they both know what we on
I'm falling out with this trio

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I got two bitches twerkin', screamin' that's my best friend
I flew two bitches and they staying at the Westin
When we talk, we communicating through group message
I can never separate them, no, especially when we sexing
Oh, both them go, both get down whenever
She taste it, then she taste it, then they drink that shit together
Like I can't pick a favorite cause they make each other better
And they on that cha-cha-cha that get the pussy wetter
Yeah she be like "Go best friend, shake that shit" (s
(Shake your ass girl)
"Go best friend and take that dick"
