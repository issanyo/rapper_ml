[Verse 1]
I love everything about your body
Open up inside, you know
You know that I'ma make you love me
If we do this one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that thing so pretty, my face gon' get sticky tonight, yeah, yeah
And I go down on it, I go to town on it, don't I, don't I

[Chorus]
Don't I give you more than you can take?
And we ain't 'bout to stop, no, girl, who needs a break?
And, girl, it’s never over 'til your body shakes
And if you ever try to leave me, girl, I'ma make it hard, hard to walk away
Promise you gon' feel me later
It's gon' be hard, hard to walk away
Feel it in your body all day
Hard, I'll make it hard to walk away

[Verse 2]
Stay in bed, rest the head, take it easy
It's gon' be your best bet
You gon' want to run away you'll see
Especially if you tryina feel your legs

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause that thing so pretty, my face gon' get sticky tonight, yeah, yeah
And I go down on it, I go to town on it, don't I, don't I

[Chorus]
Don't I give you more than you can take?
And we ain't 'bout to stop, no, girl, who needs a break?
And, girl, it’s never over 'til your body shakes
And if you ever try to leave me, girl, I'ma make it hard, hard to walk away

[Bridge]
I won’t have no problems getting up in the morning
But you will
Started with you yawning and end up with you moaning
Girl, you know I kill, kill, kill, kill that
Love it when I fill that, I'ma make you spill that
Pop it ' like a pill, that ass so fat, hell yeah
You gon' kiss and tell, yeah, ain't you babe?
Just when you think I'm done, you gon' hear me say

[Chorus]
Don't I give you more than you can take?
And we ain't 'bout to stop, no, girl, who needs a break?
And, girl, it’s never over 'til your body shakes
And if you ever try to leave me, girl, I'ma make it hard, hard to walk away
Promise you gon' feel me later
It's gon' be hard, hard to walk away
Feel it in your body all day
Hard, I'll make it hard to walk away
