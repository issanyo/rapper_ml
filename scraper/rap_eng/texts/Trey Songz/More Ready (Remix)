[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
I can't have the tissue before you sneeze, you know
I can't bow down at your feet, you know
Yeah
Drizzy

[Drake]
I got a triple king bed and I don't mind sharing
I got a big G-Wagon and I don't mind sharing
We can get wild like Olivia, we can get stoned like Sharon
Wrote "Take Care" but they push me to the point where I'm just not caring
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close
I'm just more ready than...
Yeah, yeah
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Yeah

[Drake]
You don't wanna question it, you just want definite
Yeah
I jump out of relationships before I get left in it
Yeah
The sex we'd have reminds me of the money and sucess a bit
Yeah
'Cause even when I got it, I just gotta keep getting it
Even when I got it, I just gotta keep getting it
Big hotel suit, I'm the only one in it
Always going back to some shit that I already been it
Plenty fish up in the sea but I never go fishing
We got everybody sick, sending "get well soons" and a lot of well wishes
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything, I'm watching y'all close
I'm just more ready than...
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know

[Trey Songz]
You don't wanna question it, you just want definite
You try to make it right out the [?] or what's left of it
The sex we'd have reminds me of the money and sucess a bit
'Cause even since I got it, I don't wanna stop getting it
Even since I got it, I don't wanna stop getting it
Big hotel suit, I'm not the only one in it
Always coming back when we're done and I already finished
Plenty fish up in the sea and I love to go fishing
We got everybody sick, lot of "get well soons", lot of well wishes
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than...

[Drake]
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know

[Trey Songz]
I gotta keep you rigth here 'cause I don't like sharing
Yeah, She got a big [?] and I don't like carrying
We've been gettin' wild like Olivia, never had a souvenir carring
Told 'em I was ready back when they are just not hearing
I'm just more ready than petty nowadays, just know
Young and in control, even when they stoop low
I see anything is anything and everything is a go
But I already know that
I'm just more ready than...
Yeah, yeah
