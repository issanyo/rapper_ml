[Trey Songz]
(C'mon) I like a long hair redbone thick, with them legs long (YUP)
Shawty head strong, blow me till her head gone
Shawty scream loud, shawty gone moan
Call that music to my ears, headphone
After we get it in, you can head home
Then I'm a get your friend, in my bedroom
I often fantasize I could get all you in a ride
Get so much pussy I bet you I can guess yo panty size
August 4th, is you ready for me girl
I fuck you better than dem niggas in your world
Lick that kitty cat until she purrs meow
Beat it up so bad you wanna curse me out
If you top modeling, if ya twitter following
If you in a whip, who give a shit what kinda car you in
Every girl I just want your bodies, let me borrow them
Treat em like they need it, I'll massage, touch and fondle them
Paint your body naked on my wall and when you modeling
You bust it wide open like you always had it bottled in
Drizzy told G to throw his feet up on the ottoman
I'm starving, so I'm eating all the singers I go harder then
Pause, then I start again
Fall coming hard again
I just killed the summer and the shit ain't really started yet
All of my regards are in
I kill and send a card to them
Fuck what niggas think I hit the bank and start depositing
I tried to told them I'm a problem
You should bet the over not the under
Tho the odds have been in favor of these ugh niggas
You know they love trigga
Finger fuckin make em bust
Get it, they love trigga
You can catch me with the finest
Some age like my wine is or short like my time is
Let me tell you what a dime is
She make me, wanna tear it apart and eat it up like she was prime ribs
She knows just how to grind it
Make them boys lose it and I know just how to find it
Cupid said I'm stupid cause I show you where my mind is
Heads up, shawty lift your legs up
Oh, Oh I'm nasty, I'm nasty
Don't you be appalled shawty I got what your ass need?
Just kiddin I ain't tryna be inconsiderate
But next time you bring your girls with you, consider this
