[Verse 1:]
Now I've done had lots of relationships
Ain't none of them ever added up to shit
My folks they always told me what you wish
Be careful cause that one thing you could get
So I prayed to the Lord to send me love
Send me something like an angel from up above
But instead I got a chick who played on my heart
She had me feeling good then tore me apart

[Hook:]
Love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes
Love ain't supposed to feel this way
Love ain't supposed to hurt or cause you pain
Love ain't supposed to make me cry
But now I'm trying to wipe my eyes

[Verse 2:]
She was like the devil in disguise
Spending time with me and thinking of other guys
And even though I tried my best
I can't describe the way she made me feel
All over a girl, who never gave her all
Never gave me much, when it came to love
I dont know why I spent so much time
On a love that wasn't mine
And the pain is so unkind

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Now it ain't even worth my time
Love ain't supposed to feel like I'm losing my mind
I once was blind but now I see
The girl was playing games she ain't the one for me
I'm trying to told ya
If you find a love, just dont close your eyes, you might go blind
Got to keep it smart, give it all your heart, if you fall to far in love you'll find the hard way

[Hook]
