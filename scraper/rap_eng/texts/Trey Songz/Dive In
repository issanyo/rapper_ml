[Intro]
I won’t say too much
Except you look beautiful and that

[Verse 1]
You’re soaking wet drippin, baby listen
I’m bout to take your body on a swimsuit edition
Images of you in every position
As you listenin, and the moonlight
And I give you everything that you been missing
I’m so driven, let’s go swimming
Ain’t no kitty pool, I dive in a grown women
And no, I ain’t talking bout your age
Cause you gotta be a woman, from your body to your brains
And never let your body fall victim to the fiend
Just let me lick you insane till the water fall cane
Flush your fears down the drain, this is sex ordeine
Pain is pleasure, say my name
Till I’m critically acclaimed
Jizzle champagne, all over your collar bone
Lick it, then whisper in your ear
Something monotone
All we need is wet suits and surf boards
And I’ma ride your body like a wave
Until it hurts so good
You be like eyes keep it coming like I should
Do backstrokes of cognac so hood
I’m in the mood for gold like mike phelps
After 2 laps with me, you gonn want nobody else
Unbuckle my belt, ... the sun deck is hot
As I’m hitting every spot
Temperature is rising, ain’t no surprising
Your heart rate climbing, your high...
I’m about to dive in
Baby girl hold your breath
We’re about to get so wet
Swimming in your body
Let me dive in
You know ain’t no running
Round this pool going under
Just for you baby you
Watch me stroke left, stroke right
Stroke left, stroke right
You know ain’t no running
Round this pool going under
Baby girl hold your breath
We’re bout to get so wet
Put me to the test girl when I dive

[Verse 2]
Open your fortune cookie
First slide them jeans off
Then let me dip my bread stick in your cream sauce
Turn the shower on, we’ll leave the door open
So as I’m strokin, we can have the whole floor soakin
The whole house smokin
Love when your mouth’s open
That means you lovin how I put it down
We like puppies that ate the house open
Tearing up the bedroom
She came twice and then said
I’m bout to give you head soon
Cause if I come again, I might just have a seizure
I’m not like other niggas
When I dive in, I’ma please her
You can call me aqua man, the great harpooner
Your great white shark bout to ne ...tuna
Sex on the beach, drinks in white sands
Massage under the sunset, you wish I was your man
But baby I’m a loner, when it’s all said and done
I’ll be on to the next
Until then laid back and let me

[Verse 3]
Submerge inside you girl
So deep inside you girl
You ... the place to be
So soaking girl it’s made for me
I’m about to dive in
Baby girl hold your breath
We’re about to get so wet
Swimming in your body
Let me dive in
You know ain’t no running
Round this pool going under
Just for you baby you
Watch me stroke left, stroke right
Stroke left, stroke right
You know ain’t no running
Round this pool going under
Baby girl hold your breath
We’re bout to get so wet
Put me to the test girl when I dive
