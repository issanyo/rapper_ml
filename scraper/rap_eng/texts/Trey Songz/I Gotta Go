Whoo, good evening
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out
Hope your flights were safe
Feeling real breezy, swift like the wind
It's calling my body
It's calling my soul
It's calling my mind
But girl I gotta go
Baby, it's the grind
Yes I had a good time
(Don't get me wrong)
You were so good
And I really wish I could
Stay a little bit longer
Love you a little bit stronger
And go a little deeper
Baby with you
But since this thang is calling I
Gotta answer dry your eyes
Girl don't cry
'Cause your making it hard for me
'Cause I don't want to leave
(Ooo girl)
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
(I don't wanna)
I don't want to leave no
But girl I gotta go right now
But I'll be back before you know it
So hold that thought
(That thought)
Don't you move
See I'm coming right back
Right back for you
Don't you change your position
Girl I'm on a mission
Baby trust I'll be missin'
Missin' you
'Cause I don't wanna leave
I don't want to leave
(Leave, leave, leave you baby)
But I gotta go right now
(But I gotta go though)
I'll be back to hold you down
But I don't want to leave no no no
But girl I gotta go right now
But I'll be back before you know it
Streets be calling me
(Ooh, they be callin' me)
They be calling my name
And when they call I gotta go
So I'm letting you know
(But I)
I won't be gone for long
And already I can't wait
To come home to you
I don't want to leave
(Ohh girl)
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
(I don't wanna, but I gotta)
(I'll be back to hold you down)
I don't want to leave
But girl I gotta go right now
But I'll be back before you know it
I don't want to leave
But I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave
But I gotta go right now
But I'll be back before you know it
Break it down now, ow
Naw I don't want to leave
But you know how it is when
Whoa baby keep that on
Don't take it off, keep in on
So I can take it off when I come back
Yeah fo' sho
I don't want to leave
(Since this thang is calling I)
But I gotta go right now
(Gotta answer dry your eyes)
I don't want to leave
(Girl, don't cry)
But girl I gotta go right now
(Since this thang is calling I)
I'll be back before you know it
(Gotta answer dry your eyes)
