Ass shakin' at a quarter to two
And I'm feelin' you're ready to, freak me, freak me
Bodies clappin' applause
You can hear us in the bathroom cuttin' up, freaky deaky
I got just what we need, Hennessy and some weed
Light the candles up, freaky
You inspire me with ecstasy
Got me feelin' so freaky deaky

[Verse 1: Flo Rida & Trey Songz]
Legs up on my shoulders if you want I'll bend you over
Climb on top of me, it's over, let you ride me, ride me
I'm teach you yoga, let you meet my freaky solider
We might end up on the sofa doin' the nasty, nasty
Girl, if I give you that tongue
Lick you all, over be makin' you cum
You tell a friend, now she gon' wanna come
That's how Flo Rida be havin 'em sprung
Screamin' all way to the top of your lungs
Scratchin' my back 'cause this dick is the bomb
Tappin' that ass on that Don Perignon

Sweatin' down your body, c'mere girl I want your body
Promise I won't tell nobody if you sex me, sex me
Yeah, I know you probably got a man but youse a hottie
Long legs like calamari, look so tasty, tasty
I wanna get you so wet
Outta control when I kiss on your neck
Girl, I'm a pro if you ready to flex
Any position, I stroke it the best
Play with that kitty up under your dress
Shorty I really know how to caress
Give you them hickies all over your breasts
Takin' no pity, get rid of your stress

Leave ya navel like I'm grubbin' if I eat you, eat you
