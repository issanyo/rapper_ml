Listen, pinch me if I'm dreaming
As a matter of fact, I take that back
Let me lay there inside of your love
Listening to your heartbeat

Girl, ain't no feeling better than feeling on your body
Girl, don't you move a muscle, I just wanna touch ya
If you ever took your love away, I can truly say I'd die right here today
Don't give me the world, I just want my girl

If I could have anything, I'd put it on everything
That it would be you, you, you, you, I just want you
If I could have anything, I'd put it on everything
That it would be you, you, you, you, I just want you

You are my love and my love for you, girl
Is all that I need if I had nothing more
Than our love, I'd be just fine with our love
Your shoes can't be filled, they cannot wear your heel

The truth is in you girl, there's nothing else real than our love
I'll be just fine with our love, woman, if you ever took your love away
I could truly say, I'd die right here today
Don't give me the world, I just want my girl

If I could have anything, I'd put it on everything
That it would be you, you, you, you, I just want you
If I could have anything, I'd put it on everything
That it would be you, you, you, you, I just want you

Now what would I do, where would I be, if there was no you, there'd be no me
Now think about that, girl, ohh, oh yeah
What would I do where would I be, if there was no you there would be no me
Now think about that girl think think think

If I could have anything, I'd put it on everything
That it would be you, you, you, you, I just want you
If I could have anything, I'd put it on everything
That it would be you, you, you, you, I just want you
