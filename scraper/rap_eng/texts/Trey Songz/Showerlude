[Intro]
You know you're dirty right?
Let me wash you off...
*water falling*

[Verse]
Wash your body, body
So I can kiss your body, body
I wanna rub your body
I know you're ready
And you want this super love
Want your super body on top of this super thug
We been getting twisted all night drunk up in the club
Girl I wanna kiss it so let me give you a rub down
Down, down, turn that thing around
For me, for me, baby please
Let me rub... rub

[Outro]
Now you're clean...
