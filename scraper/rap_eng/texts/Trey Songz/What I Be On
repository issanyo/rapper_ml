I walk around the club, touched every shawty
By the time I leave, bet I spend money more than everybody
Think I give a fuck? Well you wrong, hoe

Whoa, she super fly, whoa, I'm super cool, whoa
Super-duper high, yeah, she keep 'em rolled
You a bad girl, with a bad crew
Hands in the air, if I can smash you
As long as they keep my cup filled, I just really wanna see if that butt’s real
Them titties grown, that’s silicone all these boys just mimic on
Them grown, that's silicone
'Cause I get chips, Frito Lays and I'm getting, getting money all day

Fuck where you at if you ain't in this party

Marvin done fucked up 'cause she comin' in my room
Walkin' out the club, like where the after party?
You fuckin' broke as a joke, that bitch is laughin' probably
Whatever y'all on, that ain't ever half of I be on
Ballin' with the Heat, if I'm an athlete I be Bron
We all straight any city, all states
Yeah bitch you in good hands, tell them you with Allstate
Duty calls like a booty calls, call late
'Cause I'm getting, getting money all day
