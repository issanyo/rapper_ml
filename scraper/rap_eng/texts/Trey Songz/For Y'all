I put my mind and my time all up in this shit
I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing
They ask me why I do it...
I tell'em that I do it tell'em that I do it for ya'll
...for ya'll for ya'll.....

[Verse 1]
If life is a game I guess everybody watching my....
Swell days when its well played...Dwayne wade I guess kev is my L.J
Soaring super high when the L blase...
But as the jay fades way I'm victim to expectance
Never knowing what they will expect of me or what they gone suggest I be...
I probably fall short media of all sorts
Break a nigga balls then they piss a nigga off
Going through liquor withdraws tell the women in my life I couldn't catch em if they fall
Cause attention is expensive and the cost will leave your heart broke
Heavy is the pressure she just want to take it off though...
I'm I know winning but its still a steady lost think back to those days when it was just me and my dogs a Petersburg nigga with dreams of being a boss... and being me wasn't difficult at all....

[Hook]
I put my mind and my time all up in this shit
I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing
They ask me why I do it...
I tell'em that I do it tell'em that I do it for ya'll
...for ya'll for ya'll.....

[Verse 2]
If home is where the heart is
Tell me why I'm losing my mind inside of this suite that bigger than your apartment
Victim of circumstances sometimes standing in the sunshine camera flashing dumb times
Made now I'm famous now everybody know my name
But where goes old Tremaine seems as if he's fading now
Why do we get famous just to wish to turn the famous down
Normal seas in life are something very far away and close to vacant
Now but the currency I'm making now brick flips can get a whole shipment then picth em in
The dealers in your town break it down sell it out
And the numbers are a slumber compared to what's in my bank account
I put your bread to bed go head rest boo why you think I said I wanna be successful
Cause I did and I'm is and I want that...
But still the life I had before this I want back...

[Hook]
I put my mind and my time all up in this shit
I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing
They ask me why I do it...
I tell'em that I do it tell'em that I do it for ya'll
...for ya'll for ya'll.....

[Verse 3]
Now that my dreams have become my reality
I surely see that everything that glitters ain't gold
I'm only human and we breath the same air heavy as the load I bare
My family and fans just understand that a nigga really do for ya'll
That's why a nigga do it I said that's why a nigga do it ugh
Don't you know I do it (I do it) said don't you know I do it (I do it)
Don't you know I [x2]
Don't you know I do it

[Hook]
I put my mind and my time all up in this shit
I sacrifice the whole life I'm not witnessing
They ask me why I do it
I tell'em that I do it I tell'em that I do it for ya'll
For ya'll [x5]
