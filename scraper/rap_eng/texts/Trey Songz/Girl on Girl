[Verse 1]
She say but still
Nothing feel
Like the thrill
When she go with a man
Say she need a lot more than what niggas got in they pants (oooh)
Said that I could get the number
But we'll never be more than friends
Cause she just turned lesbian

[Hook]
(She say) She say she don't like dudes no more (na na she)
She be fucking with girls
Cause the dudes did her wrong
Did her wrong
Yea (And I can believe it)

And I can't blame her dogs
We just fucked up her world
Her whole world
This is for my girls and their girls (Girls ohhhhh)
This is for my girls and their girls (Girls...Girls...Girls Girls)

[Verse 2]
She said the pain runs deep cause she thought they had something for real
You can't blame all men for the things one nigga did (ooooh)
She said she hate em
But she love her new girlfriend
Baby you just caught up in a whirlwind (Trey's Woman Voice: But niggas crazy)
Not as crazy as you women be

How many times does this scene realize
Tried to put her on my team
She play for the other side
She say all these niggas crying
"I can fuck you right, I can fuck you right"
Damn you just read my mind (mind, mind, mind, MIND)
Say she never was into girls
But you don't understand cause you never been a girl
She say not just any girl
Shit I like them pretty girls
Lipstick
Kiss Kiss
Girl you know you Miss Dick...less (This shit sick)

[Hook]
She say she don't like dudes no more
She be fucking with girls
Cause the dudes did her wrong

Yea (And I can believe it)

And I can't blame her dogs
We just fucked up her world (We just fucked her world)
Her whole world
This is for my girls and their girls (Girls)

[Outro]
And I can't blame her dogs
We just fuck with their mind
We do it all the time (This is for my girls and their girls)
Think about it when you lay down at night
You feeling maybe something ain't right (This is for my girls and their girls)
She could be creepin' on you
And it might not be no dude (This is for my girls and their girls)
