Yeah, Young Money
Trigga Trey
Let’s get it
Brrr

No, I ain’t tryna flex, no ceilings you can see who’s in it
If we’re talking about sex, girl, you know that I invented that
And I’m onto the next, that’s unless you bring a friend who with it

Oh, I’m sorry, oh, you mad that I came to the party?
Like, no, no, no
You took your girl to the club and now she gone, gone, gone
Now she asking me when I’m taking her home, home, home
I tell her, “let’s go” long as you know
‘Cause I know when we get it on

(Chorus)

I’m touching you tonight, I’m loving you tonight
I’m fucking you, girl, you must be used to spending, putting in that time
Touching, loving, fucking, can’t make up my mind
I’m loving you, I’m fucking you tonight

Girl, you fucking with the best
Take a picture while I’m deep up in it
Oh, and if they living right next
Then I bet they know my name in a minute
Let me feel your body sweating, I promise I’ll keep your body dripping

Oh, I’m sorry, niggas mad that I came to the party
Like, no, no, no
You took your girl to the club and now she gone, gone, gone
Now she asking me when I’m taking her home, home, home
I tell her, “let’s go” long as you know
‘Cause I know when we get it on

(Chorus)
I’m touching you tonight, I’m loving you tonight
I’m fucking you, girl, you must be used to spending, putting in that time
Touching, loving, fucking, can’t make up my mind
I’m loving you, I’m fucking you tonight


(Nicki Minaj)
Sometimes I tell ‘em I love ‘em because I just wanna fuck ‘em
I never love ‘em, I cuff ‘em and when we done I’mma duck ‘em
He Ferragamo the buckle, he Louis V on the duffel
The pussy wetter than puddles, I ride his dick like a shuttle
I said real niggas let real bitches cum first
And real bitches been bad bitches from birth
Uh, k-k-kiss him when he cumming
M-m-make more money last year than Mister Drummond
Oh, he like it when I ride it slow

(Chorus)
I’m touching you tonight, I’m loving you tonight
I’m fucking you, girl, you must be used to spending, putting in that time
Touching, loving, fucking, can’t make up my mind
I’m loving you, I’m fucking you tonight

Nicki, you know that I love you, I’m loving you
And I really wanna touch you, I’m fucking you tonight

What you mean, "wait, no", like... what?!
You better act like you know, nigga, it’s Nicki Minaj
