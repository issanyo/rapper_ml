[Verse 1:Trey Songz]
Very little make up on, baby so flawless, oh
I just wanna wake up on, her body in the mornin'
My tender own ringtone, so I know when she callin' (She's my only love)
Shawty got an ass so fat, I love to jump on it
But she ain't, she ain't, she ain't my (yeah)
Me and her do it big, what it is
Six speed two seats to the crib (Come on)
And I'm feelin' on her thigh right now
And the ceiling is the sky right now
Legs, she working em'
Shoes, I purchased em'
Lambs and she keep em' on while we get our secret on
Hair, she keep it did
Yeah, we get it in, only on the weekends

[Hook]
Cause she ain't my girl, she ain't my girl
She ain't my girl, no she ain't my girl
While I be playin' with her body she be playin' with my mind
All the time cause her man ain't home
She ain't my girl, she ain't my girl
She ain't my girl, no she ain't my girl
Got a pretty lil' shawty
And i hit her lil' body every time cause her man be gone

[Verse 2: Sammie]
You ain't the only, homie
I've been there before
The way she be on me, moanin'
I dont wanna let her go, Nooo
We be gettin' all nasty like
She said her man don't be doing it right
So she holds me, closely
Then she feeds my appetite
I eat it up
Mmm mmm good
Her lovin' is so damn good Ohh
I can't front she know exactly what I want
But its only when her man ain't home

[Hook]

[Bridge: Trey Songz and Sammie]
I love to be up under that
She keep me coming back
All up in the sack
Like a quarterback
Then we run it back
Like a running back
And every time she leave
She make me want her back

Yeah (x15)

[Hook]
