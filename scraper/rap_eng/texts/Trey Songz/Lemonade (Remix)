[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Yeah it’s Gucci, wassup baby
Yellow everything this time
You know what I’m talking about
Yellow rims, yellow big booty, yellow bones
Yellow Lambs, yellow MP's, yellow watch
Yellow charm ring chain, yellow living room set (Chiquita!)
Lemonade Gucci shoes for my girl, it’s Gucci

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My Phantom sitting on sixes, no twenties in my denim
Your Cutlass motor knocking because it is a lemon
I like them Georgia peaches but you look more like a lemon
These sour apple bitter bitches I'm not fucking with 'em
I'm truly stupid paid, that's just how I feel today
I'm moving slow cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade
I'm standing in the shade and I'm selling lemonade
Six hundred a pint, the going rate off in the A
Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in your face
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday
I'm pimping wearing lemon, that's just how I'm chilling
I'm smoking grits and selling chickens, Corvette painted lemons (Gucci)

[Chorus]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemonade in shade with my feet up
Lemonade in shade with my feet up
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Better than the rest, it's the bestest
Only cause they expect nothinh lesser
Everytime i rock, dont you know i put on
I run the web like Spiderman and you niggas is Venom
Call me radio cause that's exactly what i been on
Fresh as watermelon so they sour like a lemon
Looking for my baby, i'm just trying get my slim on
First is on roids i been tryna get my gym on
Notoriously big so she tryna get her Kim on
(What come here)
I ain't the one to front on
Your CD is probably what niggas break they blunt on
She on that ridin you called and told her come home
Put it on silent and she got a demo, here it go come on

[Chorus]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemonade in shade with my feet up
Lemonade in shade with my feet up
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Uhh, and who the hell said they was cheaper to keep
Cause if you ain't getting money when you call you get the beeep
She can't pick up the phone, your broke ass should leave a message
And my guess is, if she never call well you get the message
You like "whaaaat, you can't call nobody?
I've been trying to find you like Waldo shawty"
She said she bout her paper if it's there she gon' get it
When the money gone she gon' be the fuck gone with it
Hey, I mean come on, she love Louis Vuitton
Yorkie in her speedy bag that she name Milan
Hair stay did like she live in a salon
Her and money go hand in hand yeah like a baton
I swear on a stack of holy Bible's and Qur'an's
We could be the Dream team baby, Kobe and LeBron
Only if you gold, I never do the bronze
Cause if you could have Beyonce would you take Solange?

[Chorus]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemonade in shade with my feet up
Lemonade in shade with my feet up
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
I'm in a tricky little mood
I trick these little dudes
I tell 'em that I love 'em but I never really do
See I like pretty shoes
And I like pretty minx
And I like site seein'
The pyramids and the sphinx
He cop Italian pieces so I do the fist pump
And I can only push it if the trunk is in the front
If the trunk is in the back, then you gotta take it back
You can hit me on the jack
I chat on the Mac
See I am who I am
Nicki M. motherfucker
If she say she not a fan
She a lyin' motherfucker
Always shoppin' in Paris
So I speak a little French
Oui Oui rag-a-de
Time for you to hit the bench

[Chorus]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemonade in shade with my feet up
Lemonade in shade with my feet up
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
