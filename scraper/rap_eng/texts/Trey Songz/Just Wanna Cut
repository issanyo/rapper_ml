[Chorus]
Come and listen baby
I know that it might sound crazy
But, I just wanna cut
And, yes I gotta lady
But girl, you driving me so crazy
Cut, make me wanna cut

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, this the prince of Virginia, when I say that I'm tryna get in ya
I ain't tryna be too dramatic but your ass is past the average
Ooh, the way that you movin' ya waist, so fat and a beautiful face
Ooh girl, I gotta have ya, don't say no, that ain't the answer

[Pre-Chorus]
Put your legs all up in the air, twist from the back and pull your hair
Ooh, baby girl let's take it there, I'll tell you girl, I'm so prepared
Just let me freak ya body 'cause you's a freaky shawty
Them tig' ol what's and that big ol' butt, girl I'm tryna get a you know what, so

[Chorus]
Come and listen baby
I know that it might sound crazy
But, I just wanna cut
And, yes I gotta lady
But girl, you driving me so crazy
Cut, make me wanna cut
Baby it's the things that you do when you do what you do
Oh babe, make me wanna cut
'Cause the way that you move, there is nothing to do
But make me wanna cut

[Verse 2]
Mama right here on this floor, I gotta let you know
The way you drop it low, ooh girl, I'm getting swole
Just let me take you home, do what I know is wrong
And once we get along, baby, I'ma sing this song

[Pre-Chorus]
Put your legs all up in the air, twist from the back and pull your hair
Ooh, baby girl let's take it there, I'll tell you girl, I'm so prepared
Just let me freak ya body 'cause you's a freaky shawty
Them tig' ol what's and that big ol' butt, girl I'm tryna get a you know what, so

[Chorus]
Come and listen baby
I know that it might sound crazy
But, I just wanna cut
And, yes I gotta lady
But girl, you driving me so crazy
Cut, make me wanna cut
Baby it's the things that you do when you do what you do
Oh babe, make me wanna cut
'Cause the way that you move, there is nothing to do
But make me wanna cut

[Bridge]
And when I twist it baby
I swear the girls up in this club tonight
It ain't a problem, we can cut tonight
And what make it special
It just as soft and round
I gotta let you know

[Chorus]
Come and listen baby
I know that it might sound crazy
But, I just wanna cut
And, yes I gotta lady
But girl, you driving me so crazy
Cut, make me wanna cut
Baby it's the things that you do when you do what you do
Oh babe, make me wanna cut
'Cause the way that you move, there is nothing to do
But make me wanna cut
