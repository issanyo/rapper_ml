[Intro]
My urb man
Hey, Bei Maejor, you got your urban on?
Cyeah, in my urb man
In my urb man

[Verse 1]
It's so unusual to me how I can see
That thing you got from the the back from your front
It's o beautiful to me, girl you see this dream I got
You'd be walking all through with the way you do it

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so, so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind

[Verse 2]
And all I see is you on top of me
Watching you ride, looking into my eyes
All I need is to be inside
I'll be sliding in the front going to the behind

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so, so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind

[Verse 3]
Aye that girl so big, aye that girl so phat
Aye the girl so big, aye that girl so phat
Why is your back bone bigger than the usual?
Lil mama why you so phat?
How long did it take that thang to grow?
I'd love to hit that front the back
Me and my cut cuts, you and your gut guts
Girl move your butt butt, diggin' your gut guts
And you already
Sit it down, put some pounds on the D

[Chorus]
Shawty I want you so, so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind
Shawty I want you so, so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind
Shawty I want you so so bad
You running through my mind
All I see is your behind
