[Verse 1: Amerie]
Is it a crime to want that old thing back?
Can it be wrong to miss the way you used to kiss me?
Back, back in the day
Back, back to the way you used to love me
Now you've got me ready to break the law again
'Cause I made a vow to rock with you 'til the end
So, tell me why lately you ain't been the same?
'Cause I remember when you said

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & Amerie]
Right from the door, said, "can we talk?"
You had me caught, got to admit it love
Let's cut straight to the point
You know with me is where you belong
Now here we are, how did we grow so much apart?
So far from the start
Let's cut straight to the point
Baby, you know with me is where you belong

[Chorus: Amerie]
Pretty brown eyes, you know, I need you
That's why I keep holding on, I can't let go
I hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I keep holding on after all your rejection
'Cause I don't wanna let go, but you should know
I'll move on, I'll move on, I'll move on
Pretty brown eyes

[Verse 2: Trey Songz & Amerie]
So let's go, let me know
You know where you belong
What's the hold?
Baby, you know with me is where you belong (Where you belong)
It's like one minute your warm
And then the next you're so cold
I never know when you're coming or going, hey
Tell me why lately you ain't been the same?
I still remember when you said

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & Amerie]
Right from the door, said can we talk?
You had me caught, got to admit it love
Let's cut straight to the point
You know with me is where you belong
Now here we are, how did we grow so much apart?
So far from the start
Let's cut straight to the point
Baby, you know with me is where you belong

[Chorus: Amerie]
Pretty brown eyes, you know, I need you
[That's why I keep holding on, I can't let go](10713442)
I hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I keep holding on after all your rejection
'Cause I don't wanna let go, but you should know
I'll move on, I'll move on, I'll move on
Pretty brown eyes

[Bridge: Amerie]
And I don't want to be the one to tell you everything
'Cause I've been spending all my time give you a chance to change
You say you're in love but if this is love
What can I do to make it feel better?
And what about the feeling that there's someone on the side?
'Cause lately you've been acting like you got so much to hide
'Cause I know that lately you ain't been the same
And so I got to let you know that

[Chorus: Amerie]
Pretty brown eyes, you know, I need you
That's why I keep holding on, I can't let go
I hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I keep holding on after all your rejection
'Cause I don't wanna let go, but you should know
I'll move on, I'll move on, I'll move on
Pretty brown eyes

[Outro: Trey Songz & Amerie]
Don't move on, don't move on
Don't move on, don't move on
Don't move on, move on from me, yeah
We belong together, forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever and ever, yeah
