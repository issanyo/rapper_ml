[Intro - Busta Rhymes]
The beautiful Miss Kelly Rowland
Looking at you, baby, you got me
Inspired to be a motivational speaker..

[Kelly Rowland]
Go, go, go, go
(Remix)
Go, go, go, go

[Busta Rhymes]
Baby, I love the way we act so civil with eachother
We can giggle with eachother, we can nibble on each other
When we make love, the way that we be crippling each other
Go me feeling like you really dipping me in butter
Closing every door and I be closing every shutter
Loving every single thing about us now
Especially how you want me to come and meet ya mother
Baby please, make no mistake
Every single little thing about you great
You know you already belong to me baby
But I’d rather leave it in the hands of fate
Mommy know you motivate me to be your one man
To protect you, lay you down and quickly taste your cream filling

[Kelly Rowland]
And when were done, I don’t wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
You can’t stop there, music still playin’ in the background
And you’re almost there
You can do it, I believe in you baby
So close from here

So baby I’mma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go
Motivation
Go, go, go, go

[Trey Songz]
Girl I’mma beat it like a drum, make your back go
When I start to go under
Now your turn, go low with it
Show that you know what to do with it
Got you out untied like I-I-I-I
Girl I’mma fool with this
You make me work harder
When you say my name
Yeaaah
It’s not over, til I make you rain oh
You gon need to fix yo hair
(And when we’re done)
Leave traces of your kiss all over me baby
You can’t stop girl, no lover
Music’s still playing in the background
Kelly

(You can do it, I believe in you baby)
Got ya heels in the air
Goooo

[Fabolous]
It’s Loso, see I got mind control
When Kelly Rowl’ come around I be quiet
When she leave I be talking again
Yeah, niceeee!

Shawty be that motivation
I’mma take it there, you just give me your location
I got no more patience
Slow rotation
Keep it clapping for me girl, more ovation
Got me doing shit, girl that body dangerous
Motivational speaker thats uses body language
And I read it well, them other boys ain't literate
I follow what you sayin’, you ain't got to Twitter shit

[Kelly Rowland]
And when were done, I don’t wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
