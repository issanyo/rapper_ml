[Intro]
You belong to me tonight, girl
I been looking for
I been looking for
A real love, oh

[Chorus]
You belong to me, tonight, my love
All I wanna do is make love slow
Girl, I want, make love slow, yeah
Girl, you know your body it deserves
Everything on this earth
I'll give it to you, ooh, I'll give it to you, yeah

[Verse 1]
And since we're only in the first verse
Girl, take off that purse and get in this room, ooh, get in this room
Now baby, oh baby, I'm ready, I'ma take control if you let me inside your world
Let me inside, please don't be afraid girl, no
Tempo slow, lights down low
Now tell me if you like down low, I'll go
'Cause I just want to please you
Believe me when I tell you that I need you

[Chorus]
You belong to me, tonight, my love
All I wanna do is make love slow
Girl, I want, make love slow, yeah
Girl, you know your body it deserves
Everything on this earth
I'll give it to you, ooh, I'll give it to you, yeah

[Verse 2]
And if I can't have your body, I don't wanna have nobody, I'd rather be alone
Ain't no substitute, they can't do what you do for me
Would you please take your clothes off or would you rather me do that part?
'Cause I don't mind, no I don't mind
Button after button, now the blouse coming off
Kissing on your stomach, now your skirt coming off
You feel so soft, where is your spot?
Kiss until I find it, must you be reminded

[Chorus]
You belong to me, tonight, my love
All I wanna do is make love slow
Girl, I want, make love slow, yeah
Girl, you know your body it deserves
Everything on this earth
I'll give it to you, ooh, I'll give it to you, yeah

[Bridge]
Aw there is no thrill
Like the thrill I feel making love to you, making love to you woman
Behold and I can't wrap my mind around it
Woman, your beauty perplexes me and you belong to me

[Chorus]
You belong to me, tonight, my love
All I wanna do is make love slow
Girl, I want, make love slow, yeah
Girl, you know your body it deserves
Everything on this earth
I'll give it to you, ooh, I'll give it to you, yeah
