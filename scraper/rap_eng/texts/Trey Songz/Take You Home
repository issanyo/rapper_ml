[Intro]
Hey x30

[Hook: Trey]
Girl I wanna take you home
Shawty you should leave out the club with me
Right after this song
Baby if you bring your body close to me
I'm gone make you moan
You can go ahead and tell your girls to leave
Cause I wanna take you home
Girl I wanna take you home
Girl I wanna take you...

[Verse 1: Trey]
Up out the club, hop in the Coupe
Drive downtown somewhere and get a room
Just me and you chilling in the penthouse
Doing what we do, d-do do do

Strawberries, whip-cream, champagne
Superman in the bed, and you Lois Lane
Finish your drink, stop the talking
Lets just do, what we both been wanting
Me touching you, you touching me
Feels like a dream or a fantasy
So let me know if you trynna leave cause...

[Hook: Trey]
Girl I wanna take you home
Shawty you should leave out the club with me
Right after this song
Baby if you bring your body close to me
I'm gone make you moan
Go ahead tell your girls to leave
Cause I wanna take you home
Girl I wanna take you home
Girl I wanna take you...

[Verse 2: Trey]
Straight to the bed
No movie watching
Girl the way you wear them jeans
Got me booty watching

I wanna touch you
I wanna kiss you
I wanna smack your ass
Like this *clap*clap*clap*

Now we can make love and sex
I wanna put your body to the test
And I do it so good
You'll be in the bed stuttering
Saying that I'm the be-be-be-be...

So finish your drink
Stop the talking
Lets just do what we both been wanting
Me touching you, you touching me
Feels like a dream or a fantasy
So let me know if you trynna leave cause...

[Hook: Trey]

[Outro]
Anywhere you wanna go
All you gotta do is let me know
See I prefer you to go with me
Cause all I wanna do is please your body

Girl I wanna take you home
Shawty you should leave out the club with me
Right after this song
Baby if you bring your body close to me
I'm gone make you moan
You can go ahead and tell your girls to leave
Cause I wanna take you home
Girl I wanna take you home
