[Intro]
You know I have to be honest
It's like, for the first time in my life my pride is not involved
And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid to tell you girl, girl I love you
Believe that and if I can't have you, I don't know what I'ma do, listen to me

[Verse 1]
So many people never find the one, that's why I really wanna tell you something
I really think this is it for me, I really think you're the one I need
'Cause baby I done had 'em all and I don't want nobody but you
Now darling

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey let me break it down, see we living in a lonely world
Ain't you tired of the running round, don't you wanna be my only girl?
Baby, can I be the one you call when you tired of the lies?
And the truth is all you wanna hear, well if you swear

[Chorus]
Baby, here I am, I'm your man
I came with everything you needed, you and me are undefeated
'Til the end of time, one mind, one heart, one love
All you gotta do is
Take my hand, we will stand
This was made to last forever, so let's say it together
For the rest of time, one mind, one heart one love
Oh listen baby

[Verse 2]
I'll give you all I'm worth, from my head down to my shoes
And girl if we gon' work, then I need the same from you
I know that so many other dudes cheat, but so many dudes ain't me
Give me my pick girl, hand it down and I'll pick you girl every time

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna break it down, see we living in a lonely world
Ain't you tired of the running round, don't you wanna be my only girl?
Baby, can I be the one you call when you tired of the lies?
And the truth is all you wanna hear, if you swear

[Chorus]
Baby, here I am, I'm your man
I came with everything you needed, you and me are undefeated
'Til the end of time, one mind, one heart, one love
All you gotta do is
Take my hand, we will stand
This was made to last forever, so let's say it together
For the rest of time, one mind, one heart one love
Ooh

[Bridge]
Love is hard to find, but love is one of a kind
And I've got mine, so if you got yours, then you know what you're living for
This goes out to all my lovers tonight
And if you listening to my groove, and your babe is next to you
Tell 'em, you are all I need and I'll never let go
You are all I need and I'll never let go, never let go of you and

[Chorus]
Here I am, I'm your man
I came with everything you needed, you and me are undefeated
'Til the end of time, one mind, one heart, one love
All you gotta do is
Take my hand, we will stand
This was made to last forever, so let's say it together
For the rest of time, one mind, one heart one love
Oh, yeah

[Outro]
You are all I need and I'll never let go, love, love
Tell 'em, you are all I need and I'll never let go
You are all I need and I'll never let go
Tell 'em, you are all I need and I'll never let go
