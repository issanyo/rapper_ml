[Intro]
Come here girl, give me a kiss, yeah

[Verse 1]
Valentine's Day done came early
And whatever you want, girl, you deserve it
'Cause you warmer than the summer time, so I hold you through the winter time
And the love inside your eyes could turn a cloudy day to sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
I make a move then you make a move
I'm wanting your love with nothing to lose
I'm in the mood, if you in the mood
To go in the room and do what we do
It's going down
I want your body in my arms right now

[Chorus]
Want your pretty red lips, red lips
Girl, you know what you do to me
When you got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone
Red lips, red lips
You got that red, you got that red
You got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone

[Verse 2]
You be my number one, tell me how you want it done
See baby, you're my favorite melody, the sound of you is heavenly
I say thank you to the heavens
As I listen to my angel sing

[Pre-Chorus]
I make a move then you make a move
I'm wanting your love with nothing to lose
I'm in the mood, if you in the mood
To go in the room and do what we do
It's going down
I want your body in my arms right now

[Chorus]
Want your pretty red lips, red lips
Girl, you know what you do to me
When you got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone
Red lips, red lips
You got that red, you got that red
You got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone

[Bridge]
Ooh and nothing ever felt to so right
'Cause I never knew that a touch could taste
And a kiss could feel so good
There is nothing, there's nothing like your lips, they taste like candy
Make me wanna work to make you happy
So please put it on, I love when it's on
And I'ma kiss you 'til it's gone

[Chorus]
Want your pretty red lips, red lips
Girl, you know, firl, you know what you do to me
When you got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone
Red lips, red lips
Oh girl you got that red, you got that red
You got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone
Want your pretty red lips, red lips
Girl, you know what you do to me
When you got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone
Red lips, red lips
You got that red, you got that red
You got that red lipstick on
Baby, kiss me 'til your lipstick gone
