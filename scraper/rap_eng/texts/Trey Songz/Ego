Uh this goes out to you(you) and you(you) and you(you) and you
Oh listen

[Verse 1:]
To say im egotistical
Is so stereotypical
If I say im the shit then baby you can be my tissue roll
Girl you like a toostie roll
How many licks do it take till it stick to my face(I wanna know)
45 46... 50 licks
Got somewhere to go so can we make it quick
Not a quickie though
Have faith like Biggie though
We in the chase for that Diddy dough
I should make a sex video
Way I'm hitting hoes
They be singing opera like figueroa figueroa figueroa
Yea singin' nigga from the ghetto
Ain't nothing like a pretty woman in stilettos
(Yeaa) Sex Olympics, I won a medal
Girl you need to ride no brakes no pedals
Yea I'm drunker then a motherfucka
Even when I'm drunk tho I'm hotter then these other bustas
They say I'm wrong for saying that
(Well)But shit you wrong for saying that
I'm sick of dos equis
You so petty
I'm so ready
Once had a akward moment only cause I wanted to
Middle finger my opponents
Baby girl I'm zoning
And I really give a fuck if you was on it
Song called bedroom cause you featured on it
Satin sheets bed room I'mma beat you on it
They say my head big
Cause my head is
So I walk like my legs big
Is it illegal to have an ego the size of pluto
When I
Know that I'm flyer
Then any guy that you know

Baby what you name is
Tell me who you hang with
Money out the anus
I can make you famous
So many people say that I'm conceited
(Well damn! Come on)
I'm really starting to believe it
Set a lot of goals and I'm starting to achieve it
Tell me what's the reason
Winter spring summer fall
All of ya'll think I'm the one you wanna be with
I be on some "G" shit
I hit it the deepest

Chorus[Beyonce and Trey]
(Beyonce)
Too big
Too wide
Too strong
It won't fit
Its too much
Its too tough

(Trey)
She talk like this cause I can back it up(true)
I got a big you know(yes I do)
Such a huge you know
Its so big
Cause she love my big you know(that's what she said)
I talk like this cause I can back it up

[Verse 2:]
Flight got delayed I was waiting on the call
Couple hours later performing for a crowd
Said that I'm the shit
Shawty watch me move a bowel
Just like Vanna White when shawty move a vowel

The beast tryna eat her
Wilder beast on the prowl
Get it super wet, now you gone need a towel
You a super freak gone and put it in yo mouth
Have fun, oh baby, we gone end up with a child

Chorus
(Beyonce)
Too big
Too wide
Too strong
It won't fit
Its too much
Its too tough

(Trey)
She talk like this cause I can back it up(true)
I got a big you know(yes I do)
Such a huge you know
Its so big
Cause she love my big you know(that's what she said)
I talk like this cause I can back it up
