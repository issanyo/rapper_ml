[Verse 1]
Girl it's been about three weeks
Since you came to see me
I get it, I get it, you ain't ready tryna fall
But damn, you could answer my calls, damn
No matter how long it takes
Girl you know, girl you know
No matter how far you try to run away
I'll be close, I'ma let you up in

[Chorus]
These thoughts of mine
Who you've been giving all your time?
Girl a love like mine is hard to find
And you, you give me such a hard time
Girl, tonight it's gon' be all mine, all mine
And I'm on it you gon' wake up like, "Damn he gave me a hard time"
Hard time, hard hard, hard, hard times
Hard, hard times, hard, hard times

[Verse 2]
It done been about three weeks
Since I had your knees weak
Said you were coming back, coming back, what happened to that?
Is it too good, did I hit it too good? I made you run from that
You gon' take it all, make you shake and shiver 'cause you be acting fickle all
I'ma make you ride it like a bicycle
When you say you coming through, won't you come?
'Cause every time you come through, don't you cum?

[Chorus]
Ooh, these thoughts of mine
Who you've been giving all your time?
Girl a love like mine is hard to find
And you, you give me such a hard time
Girl, tonight it's gon' be all mine, all mine
And I'm on it you gon' wake up like, "Damn he gave me a hard time"
Hard time, hard hard, hard, hard times
Hard, hard times, hard, hard times

[Verse 3]
It done been about three weeks, that's 500 hours, since I had you in the club with the bottles
Man, I swear we stunting out all to the crib, tub, shower
D'usse in our system, that's when you say you gon' go down
And I can't let you do that all alone, I'ma go down
Like lalalala lalalalalala
Tongue kissing on your lips that's way down below
Girl, let me be your sex hero
I'm just letting you know

[Chorus]
These thoughts of mine
Who you've been giving all your time?
Girl a love like mine is hard to find
Why you, you give me such a hard time
Girl, tonight it's gon' be all mine, all mine
And I'm on it you gon' wake up like, "Damn he gave me a hard time"
Hard time, hard hard, hard, hard times
Hard, hard times, hard, hard times

[Outro]
It done been about 3 weeks
It done been about 3 weeks
It done been about 3 weeks
