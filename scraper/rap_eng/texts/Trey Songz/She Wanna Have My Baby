[Verse 1 - The Game]
Everybody fucking Amber Rose
Is the pussy good
Only Kanye and Cameron knows
And who this Tammy ho? Telling her me and Tre are shooting a video
In a month and she can get a cameo
SMH. TTM. Five star
We be em. LOL, hi my BBM ain't got my BBM
Louis Vuiton he be in, 'tron got him queasy
And my money ain’t young, ask my nigga Little Weezy and 'em
I keep one rolled like Wiz Khalifa and 'em
Got some college hoes that wanna smoke a Swisher Sweet with him
They ain't no Lauren Londons but they got that Meagan Goode
They use that Photoshop to get their ass up out the hood
And it’s all good when us niggas mayne
I said it’s all good cause I am with Trigga, man
Yeah, she said she wanna have Jayceon kid
I told that bitch you better off with Jason Kidd

[Hook - Trey Songz]

I do it cause they love it
If you hate it bitch who give a fuck, I made it
Plus I do it for the ladies
Somebody say they wanna have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
Who tryna have my baby?
She said she wanna have my baby
Tryna have my baby

How many bitches in the club just trying to fuck a platinum rapper
Poking microscopic holes into the magnum wrappers
Hopping on the dick but I ain't throwing carrots at ya
You ain't gonna Worldstar me, I ain’t your average rapper
You drinking all the Goose & bitch I ain’t fittna pay
You don't look like your Twitter avatar any way
Bitch you look like an Avatar anyway
And that’s the same bitch that was stalking Fab, ain’t it Tre?
And this is how I know you giving free head
If you was getting paid the bottom of your shoe would be red
But it ain’t, she claiming she a saint
But as soon as she sees Dwight she going hard in the paint
Girlfriend-type you wanna take home
Throw a little Drake on, it really shouldn't take long
Then she told me she want me & Tre Songz
I told that bitch "strip, and start singing all Tre's songs"

[Hook - Trey Songz]

I do it cause they love it
If you hated bitch fuck cause I made it
I do it for the ladies
Somebody say they wanna have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
I am trying to have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
I am trying to have my baby

[Trey Songz]
You look much better than your friend
Just for the night let me be your boyfriend
With that baby, let's go
Ain't no sense in waiting on me
Nobody that I know, they don't be debating on it
They gon' say we did it, even though we didn't
I'mma play cool, interviews, say I didn’t

Mr steal your girl!
Looking for your girl ?
Looking for a night out and they both came back to me
If you jump up in the club go on, clap for me
