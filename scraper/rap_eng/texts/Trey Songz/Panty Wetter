[Verse 1]
Here we go, here again, here again
I wanna know, how you been, how you been
Such a surprise, didn't think you'd come back so soon
Got a drink in my cup girl, got weed rolled up but I'm high off you tonight
Bet yo ass ain't think I will come so hard upon this Chapter V
I've toured the world and made some money, learned some different things
And now I'm here to show your body what these niggas can't
Your panty dropper has returned and I'm going low
To please your body is my mission, if you don't know
Just take your time I just wanna go nice and slow

[Pre-Chorus]
First thing take off them clothes
But you can leave them panties on
You've had my love before
So you know I might make 'em soak

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm your panty wetter
I'm your panty wetter
You ain't gotta take 'em off, just pull it to the side
Don't you try to run girl, ain't no place to hide
I'm your panty wetter
And you know it don't, it won't get no better
No one is gon' get you wetter

[Verse 2]
Here we are you and me, you and me
A special show made for two to see
Girl, we 'bout to make the best love you've ever dreamed

[Pre-Hook]
But you gon' have to come about them clothes
You can leave them panties on
You've had this love before
So you know I'm 'bout to make you soak

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm your panty wetter
I'm your panty wetter
You ain't gotta take 'em off, just pull it to the side
Don't you try to run girl, ain't no place to hide
I'm your panty wetter
And you know it don't, it won't get no better
No one is gon' get you wetter

[Bridge]
Break it down
All the way down

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm your panty wetter
I'm your panty wetter
You ain't gotta take 'em off, just pull it to the side
Don't you try to run girl, ain't no place to hide
I'm your panty wetter
And you know it don't, it won't get no better
No one is gon' get you wetter

[Outro]
No one is gonna get you wetter than a fountain
Waterfalling off my mountain
It's such beauty when we meet
I'm the sand and you're the sea
I'm the pipe girl you're the leak
It's only one thing left you can do for me
Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off
Please
