[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Usually hear the phone late night like now
She usually say no, but she almost always breaks right down
She finna drive an hour to my house, right now
Can't wait to break the walls and knock all your lights out
She said that she should probably be alone right now
How long has it been?
Why are you even all up on my phone right now?
You leave my body weak
Then you disappear for weeks
And I'm way too strong right now
Where you been?
Why do you go missing?
Where you be when I need your attention?
I know that you need that (need some)
Tell me you don't miss it you don't want it right now
Cause all I need to hear, you can lay it back down
Tell me you don't think about it, that's a damn lie
Don't nobody make it feel, make it feel like when I'm inside
You don't got to gas me girl, I'm full up
Imma let you get some sleep, get some give up
She said you really want this pussy, you would pull out

[Chorous]
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is, come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

[Verse 2: Mike Angel]
Waist too slim, got a face like Rihanna
Say you sick and tired of the drama
I just want to give you oh na na
While your dad and mom top shotta
I know I haven't called in a long time
I been in the zone on my own time
No days off talking long nights
Never at the crib on the long flights
I just gotta know if it's mine tonight
I got some time tonight
Imma roll the gas oh
Who could fuck your bed up
Face down hit the ass up
You know I keep it wetter
Imma hit it every angle
Neighbors know my name
Got you screaming Mike Angel

[Chorus]
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she hit me with is, come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
You been putting time aside for me
You say I never got the time for you
I be in the zone, I be worried about my own thing
Girl, I know it's wrong to be this selfish
But I got some problems inside I don't never tell nobody
But there's something when I look in your eyes
That say it's okay for me to love you
Say it's okay for me to trust you
Say it's okay for me to need you
Imma put it out there, yeah
I'm scared
Stopping at the store
You want anything from here?
Ten minutes Imma be there
All she sayin'

[Chorus]
Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
All she ever say is, come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me
