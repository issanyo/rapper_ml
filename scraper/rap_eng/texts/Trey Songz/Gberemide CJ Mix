Afrofusion Knocking
Chi-town keep rocking
Geee Money, Midwest let's go

I dey go to Chicago
Every third Saturdays
Where my DJ dey turn me on
Some good good Music
So this one day I dey town
I tried to keep my head down low
But the harder I tried O
The more obvious it seemed
The lightee shine now eh!
God he don do am
Dem no fit quench am. Eh!
God He done seal am
Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!

So I run from the Midwest
I come go East Coast
Where the people dem yapa like colors of rainbow
So this one day I goo town
Still trying to keep my head down low
But the harder I try on the more obvious it seemed

The light he shine now
Dem won kill am
Dem no fit quench am
My God he done seal am
