[Verse]
Soon as you get here, I'll be ready to make love
It will be so crystal clear that I'm ready to make love
All day yearning for your body
You're my woman, you deserve good love, good love
I'm fiening for your kisses
You're my misses, I'm gon' give you good love, love, love
I'm ready, I'm ready
