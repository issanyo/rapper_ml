[Intro: Trey Songz & T.I.]
Tell the DJ turn it up
Bet the DJ bring it back
Tell him play that shit again
Tell him that you like that, like that, oh
Trey, I ain't got but two reasons to be here man
All the ballers poppin' bottles

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I know it's somebody birthday
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Yeah and somebody gettin' drunk too
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Catch me in the club like I own that bitch
Shawty dancin' like she on that dick
Bad bitches never hold back
Send me a picture, where your phone at?

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I only came here for two reasons
I came for, whatchu came for?
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
For the bitch, ca-came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks, what you came for?
Baby, get your glass up, only came for bitches and the drinks
Baby, get your ass up, that's what I came for

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I see you tryin' to handcuff her on the street
Stop trippin', you can't control that freak
Ain't nobody got a body like hers
Ghetto booty, but she came from the 'burbs
Got a dark skinned girl dancin' on me
Two white girls dancin' on me
Bad yellow bone, yeah I'm in my zone
Waitress keep comin' back, so you know we hella gone

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I only came here for two reasons
I came for, whatchu came for?
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
For the bitch, ca-came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks, what you came for?
Baby, get your glass up, only came for bitches and the drinks
Baby, get your ass up, that's what I came for

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I hit the club and buy the bar
In VIP, just see my partners and a lot of broads
And such a G' I be, just pop them bottles, party hard
I'm done with today, I'm lookin' for tomorrow
All I do is turn up, ain’t no dough it don’t concern us
All this bubba kush I burn up, smell some regular, it ruined us
Turning corners, fishtailin' out the parking lot yellin'
Bankhead, west side, eight or nine chicks trailin'
Right behind us, been this way since we were minors
If it wasn't for the chicks up in this bitch, you wouldn't find us
Even way out in China, same thing when I came through the door
Like, here you go again, where the bitches and the drink, yo

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I only came for
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
You need to know what I came for
Bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
I know you know what I came for
Baby, get your glass up, only came for bitches and the drinks
Baby, get your ass up, that's what I came for

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Hey girl, you heard what I said, get your ass up
If you hot, you cold, you Florida, Alaska
Chicago, Virginia, New York City
Houston where the girls all thick
LA, the Bay, tell your girl 'bout this
Matter fact tell the whole GA
Ooh, you know they fine up and down the Carolinas
Shout to every ten I see when I'm down in Tennessee

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I only came here for two reasons
I came for, whatchu came for?
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
