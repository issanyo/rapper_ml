[Intro]
I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
She cares too, I don't wanna talk about it
I care enough, I don't wanna talk about it

[Verse 1]
She cares too much, I care enough
I love her, but, never said enough

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is so heavy and time doesn't let me think about shit
So much stress in my life that I'm holding inside, then I think about this

[Chorus]
She said we ain't gotta talk about it
If I don't wanna talk about it
But if I wanna talk about it
She's all ears
She says she's really worried 'bout me
But if I ain't really worried 'bout it
She ain't really tripping on it
But she's still here

[Verse 2]
I said that I had nothing to hide
My life, my lies, losing my damn mind
She said, "Put it aside, I'll hold your pride"
And I can't ever explain why I ain't ever got time
Addicted to these girls, all around the world
Always want a new one
And it's, "Can I get a favor? Throw me little paper"
Everyone needs something in here

[Pre-Chorus]
My mind is so heavy and time doesn't let me think about shit
So much stress in my life that I'm holdin' inside, then I think about this

[Chorus]
She said we ain't gotta talk about it
If I don't wanna talk about it
But if I wanna talk about it
She's all ears
She says she's really worried 'bout me
But if I ain't really worried 'bout it
She ain't really tripping on it
But she's still here
She said we ain't gotta talk about it
If I don't wanna talk about it
But if I wanna talk about it
She's all ears
She says she's really worried 'bout me
But if I ain't really worried 'bout it
She ain't really tripping on it
But she's still here
We ain't gotta talk about it
If I don't wanna talk about it
But if I wanna talk about it
She's all ears
She says she's really worried 'bout me
But if I ain't really worried 'bout it
She ain't really tripping on it
But she's still here
