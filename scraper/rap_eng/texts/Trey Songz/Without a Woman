[Verse 1]
Picture this: coming home from a long day's work, no food is left
Picture this: steady tryna show the world of your worth and nobody cares
Picture this: no kissing, ain't no touching, there's no hugging
And in the evening no good loving

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no pretty picture you can paint
Ain't no way this life would be the same

[Chorus]
I'm telling you a man can't be a man without a woman, no
And you can try as hard as you can but we ain't nothing without a woman, nothing
Living in a world so cold, so cold, cold
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman

[Verse 2]
What if you, had no hands to rub upon your shoulders
And in the morning she's not there to fix your Folgers
You're sick as a dog right now
Kids running all around the house, no one to help you out
Picture this: you paying these bills all by yourself
No one to tell you, "Watch your health", but keep fucking up, you might as well
Picture this: 'cause your world don't spin without her
And hers gon' spin without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no pretty picture you can paint
Ain't no way this life would be the same

[Chorus]
I'm telling you a man can't be a man without a woman, no
And you can try as hard as you can but we ain't nothing without a woman, nothing
Living in a world so cold, so cold, cold
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman

[Bridge]
Say hello to pain, goodbye to love
Hello to rain, the sun won't ever shine again
There'll be no Wednesday movie nights
No make-ups after fights
Girl, I'll make it right
I'm all lonely with my pillow
Your car's not in the driveway, clothes ain't in the closet
Girl, I'm broken-hearted, come and find me 'cause I'm lost without my woman

[Chorus]
And I know that a man can't be a man without a woman
You can try hard as you can, without a woman, nothing
Living in a world so cold, cold
The fire burns through my soul, without my woman

[Outro]
See baby, life ain't life
And living ain't living without my woman
I'm hurting inside
Without my woman no, no, no
