We used to be, we used to be
Lovers
But now we don't, ever see
Each other

Hook:
And I know you think
I'm too busy for love
(No, no)
When did everything become
So fucked up? (Oh, no)
The blame can't all be mine (no)
Cuz it was just a matter of time
(I'm sorry)

Chorus:
Gotta hop on this flight
So let's skype, tonight
(Yeah)
What once was so easy
Girl please believe me
It's hard, but I'll try
We gon' be alright
So go ahead baby
Won't you poke it open?

While I can keep focused
Everything in slow motion
(Yeah)
So go head baby why don't you poke it open
While you got me focused
Cause baby in a moment
I'll probably be over the ocean

And I know you think I'm too busy for love
But when did everything become so Fucked up
The blame can't all be mine no
Cause it was just a matter of time

[Hook]

Gotta hop on this fights
So let's skype, tonight
(Yeah)
What once was so easy
Girl please believe me
It's hard, but I'll try
We gon' be alright
So go ahead baby
Won't you poke it open?

You so bad, you so bad
Of course I miss you
You know I love you
Why you always talking about bitches?
Like we just had a great moment..
And, no!
Listen, I'm on this computer
With yo pretty ass
I'm not worried about no bitches!

Woo
