[Intro]
Oh, cake, cake
Oh, cake, cake
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Baby, this might sound rude
I'm taken but I want you
And I don't wanna play by the book, no rules
They say you can't have cake and eat it too
But ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Ain't you s'posed to eat it too?
Ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Ain't I s'posed to eat it too if cake's on the menu?
Cake's-cake's on the menu
Cake's-cake's-cake's on the menu
I'd like to have dessert for starters
Tell me baby, can you take my order?

[Verse 1]
Hey pretty lady
Give me some of that cake
I'd like to place an order, ooh, I just wanna taste
And ooh I'd hate to wait
Wanna lay your body down all over my plate
Once I blow the candles out, put it in my face
So tell me you gon' serve it up nice
The customer's always right, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, this might sound rude
I'm taken but I want you
And I don't wanna play by the book, no rules
They say you can't have cake and eat it too
But ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Ain't you s'posed to eat it too?
Ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Ain't I s'posed to eat it too if cake's on the menu?
Cake's-cake's on the menu
Cake's-cake's-cake's on the menu
I'd like to have dessert for starters
Tell me baby, can you take my order?

[Verse 2]
Light-skinned girls got that red velvet
Dark-skinned girls, chocolate
White girls got vanilla frosting
Cake tastes great, I love all of it
I've got a sweet tooth and it's just for you
It ain't hard to see it through, girl, I know you want to
So tell me you gon' serve it up nice
The customer's always right, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, this might sound rude, I know it may sound rude
I'm taken but I want you
I don't wanna play by, and I don't wanna play by the book, no rules
They say you can't have cake and eat it too, what the fuck is they talking 'bout?
But ain't that what you s'posed to do? You must be crazy
Ain't you s'posed to eat it too? It ain't no way that
Ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Ain't I s'posed to eat it too if cake's on the menu?
Cake's-cake's on the menu, I'ma get my hands on you
Cake's-cake's-cake's on the menu
I'd like to have dessert for starters
Tell me baby, can you take my order?

[Outro]
Ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Cake's on the menu
Ain't I s'posed to eat it too?
Cake's on the menu
