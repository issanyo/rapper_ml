[Intro: Rick Ross]
Billionaire yeah you feel me
I have your bitch lacin' up my shoes homey
Rollin' them L's up haha
Gettin' money

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This is the life, this is the life
Ain't no stoppin' the champagne from poppin', her drawers from droppin'
This is the life, this is the life
Keep shit poppin', these hoes, they stay bobbin', no stoppin' us every night
This is the life, ain't no stoppin'
The law from watchin' but we serve it up for a hell of a price
This is the life, this is the life
This is the, this is the life

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Uh I'm the man you wanna stand near
Damn near a hundred grand in jewels in my Stan Smith
Snitches stand clear, can't no snitches stand here
This reserve for them trill, I'm red carpet every year
Take a picture, canary stones so photogenic
No I didn't grow up with it so I had to go and get it
Started with a biscuit, now I got a loaf
Hoes wanna slice I wanna tell her no
But I can't I get a rush blowin' dough
I'm gettin' bank, I'm in a rush to blow it though
This is the life, I'm in a race to get money
This is the life, I need a bad bitch to blow it for me

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This is the life, this is the life
Ain't no stoppin' the champagne from poppin', her drawers from droppin'
This is the life, this is the life
Keep shit poppin', these hoes, they stay bobbin', no stoppin' us every night
This is the life, ain't no stoppin'
The law from watchin' but we serve it up for a hell of a price
This is the life, this is the life
This is the, this is the life

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Not that I'm arrogant, I'm just extravagant
I'm a boss player, check my laminate
I got hoes in Memphis, hoes in Maryland
White girl in Carolina, let's call her Carol Anne
She love ballplayers hate the dope boys
'Cause we fight dogs, call me Jeff George
Yeah this the Superbowl of the street shit
It's all fast food, my niggas eat quick
When I seen a million, it fucked up my life
Brand new twenty cars, party for twenty nights
Fucked plenty wives, crushed many lives
I wouldn't it change for the world
This is the life

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This is the life, this is the life
Ain't no stoppin' the champagne from poppin', her drawers from droppin'
This is the life, this is the life
Keep shit poppin', these hoes, they stay bobbin', no stoppin' us every night
This is the life, ain't no stoppin'
The law from watchin' but we serve it up for a hell of a price
This is the life, this is the life
This is the, this is the life

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm campin' in the Hamptons
Chillin' in a play station
'Cause I'm playin' with them chips that you ain't makin'
I ain't fakin', trap ain't vacant
California raisins keep me feelin' Jamaican
The block bakin', the blunt burnin'
I'm in Trump Towers, amongst earners
Fine escorts for the GFE
Fine lip service for the Triple C
Words rhymin' best, can't spell well
But I define success, I sell well
So I make a toast, the fallen comrades
Hold the bottles up, we standin' tall fam

[Hook: Trey Songz]
This is the life, this is the life
Ain't no stoppin' the champagne from poppin', her drawers from droppin'
This is the life, this is the life
Keep shit poppin', these hoes, they stay bobbin', no stoppin' us every night
This is the life, ain't no stoppin'
The law from watchin' but we serve it up for a hell of a price
This is the life, this is the life
This is the, this is the life
