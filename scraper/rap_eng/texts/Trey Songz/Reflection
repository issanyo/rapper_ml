[Chorus]
Ah, put that body on me, I know you like that shit
Treat it like a pony, the way you ride that shit
Know you love a nigga, you ain't gotta hide that shit
Fuck your other nigga, he don't go provide that shit
If you want it, baby, I'll go and get it
If you want it, baby, I'll go and get it
Kill that pussy and I never leave a witness
Fuck what they heard, tell 'em, mind they business
Fuck what they heard, tell 'em, mind they business
Fuck what they heard, tell 'em, mind they business
You a real one, that's just my perception
Real recognize real, my reflection

[Post-Chorus]
They gon' try to fuck us up, that's just nature
Every time you goin' up, don't they hate ya?
Tell me what you feel, let me hold it
And if it's real, they cannot control it

[Verse 1]
Let me put my hand where your soul is
Baby, you a star like it's show biz
You ain't gotta ask
I be on call with that paper, that's facts
So, what you need, what you need? Tell me, I get it, I get it
I'll spend it, I'll spend it
Just for you to have it
Make sure you got it even if I didn't have it
Real love, goes a long way
And games, I ain't even tryna play
Put that thang on me , today
Put that body on me

[Chorus]
Put that body on me, I know you like that shit
Treat it like a pony, the way you ride that shit
Know you love a nigga, you ain't gotta hide that shit
Fuck your other nigga, he don't provide that shit
If you want it, baby, I'll go and get it (Get it)
If you want it, baby, I'll go and get it
Kill that pussy and I never leave a witness
Fuck what they heard, tell 'em, mind they business
Fuck what they heard, tell 'em, mind they business
Fuck what they heard, tell 'em, mind they business
You a real one, that's just my perception
Real recognize real, my reflection

[Post-Chorus]
They gon' try to fuck us up, that's just nature
Every time you goin' up, don't they hate ya?
Tell me what you feel, let me hold it
And if it's real, they cannot control it

[Verse 2]
Let me put my ear to your heartbeat
I wanna appear where your thoughts be
Said, I'm falling in love, where you got me
I'ma always pick up when you call me (Yeah)
Girl, my heart was cold, come defrost me (Defrost me)
Fuckin' with these hoes, yeah, it done cost me (Mm, yeah)
When I lost you girl, I lost me (Lost)
Now, you're back, yeah, you're back, put that ass on me

[Chorus]
Put that body on me, I know you like that shit
Treat it like a pony, the way you ride that shit
Know you love a nigga, you ain't gotta hide that shit
Fuck your other nigga, he don't provide that shit
If you want it, baby, I'll go and get it (Get it)
If you want it, baby, I'll go and get it
Kill that pussy and I never leave a witness
Fuck what they heard, tell 'em, mind they business
Fuck what they heard, tell 'em, mind they business
Fuck what they heard, tell 'em, mind they business
You a real one, that's just my perception
Real recognize real, my reflection
