[Verse 1]
I'm all alone in this big old house
Think I'm 'bout to watch a movie, all my friends went out
And the pool's feeling good, it's just the right temp'
Don't remember the last time I even got in, I think what I need is

[Pre-Chorus]
Company to comfort me, you call at the right time
Fun for you is fun for me, we are such a good time

[Chorus]
And I wanna see you tonight, it's been a long time
I'm feeling lonely tonight, come and get it right
She said, "Okay baby, I'll be on my way"
Ask me can her home girl come
We gon' have a lot of fun here
Just call me when you're coming
Got nothing else to do, just waiting for you
Just waiting for you

[Verse 2]
Think I'ma go get myself cleaned up
I'm finna hop up out the shower, feeling real fresh, fresh, real fresh
I'ma chill, I'ma chill, right up to the very second you get here
And let you know how I feel as soon as you walk in, I need your

[Pre-Chorus]
Company to comfort me, you call at the right time
Fun for you is fun for me, we are such a good time

[Chorus]
And I wanna see you tonight, it's been a long time
I'm feeling lonely tonight, come and get it right
She said, "Okay baby, I'll be on my way"
Ask me can her home girl come
We gon' have a lot of fun here
Just call me when you're coming
Got nothing else to do, just waiting for you
Just waiting for you

[Bridge]
Think I'm 'bout to make myself a drink
Thinking how we did it on the sink
Think I'm 'bout to roll myself a join
I could roll some more up if you want, that's if you want
I'm faded, now I'm sitting on the couch
I'll tell you what else I'm thinking 'bout
I'm thinking 'bout how I'mma hit it every kind of way
Call me when you're 5 minutes away

[Chorus]
And I wanna see you tonight
I'm feeling lonely tonight
She said, "Okay baby, I'll be on my way"
You can bring your friend, soon as you walk in
We gon' have a lot of fun here
Just call me when you're coming
Got nothing else to do, just waiting for you
Just waiting for you
We gon' have a lot of fun here
Just call me when you're coming
Got nothing else to do, just waiting for you
Just waiting for you, just waiting for you
Just waiting for you, you, you
Just waiting for you, just waiting for you
Just waiting for you, you, you
Just waiting for you
