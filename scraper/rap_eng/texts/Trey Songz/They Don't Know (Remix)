[Verse 1: Ludacris]
They don’t know I call you sprinkler system
'Cause you sprinklin' like water
Don’t tell your daddy you be callin' me daddy
But tell him Ludacris is thankful for his daughter
While we all in the backseat of my Impala
Hut one, hut two, hike, hike, hike
They don’t know about the scratches on my back
And how I call you my bed bug, when you bite, bite, bite, bite
Nibblin', dribblin', fillin' all my adrenaline
Tastin' like cinnamon, I can think of so many synonyms
You be killin' 'em, other women pretendin'i
They don't know that you really hardcore like Lil’ Kim and 'em
Squat down, bend it over, bring it back
From the side, turn around, hunch back, Notre Dame
Turn your device on, it’s the right song
Turn the lights on, Rico Love and you know my name

[Verse 2: Rico Love]
They don't know
A loud mouth won’t get you nowhere, baby I swear
They don’t know, I’m best friends with Giuseppe
If you let me, I’ll put you in something rare
They don’t know, yeah, I fucked with ya home girl back in '06
Why she keep bringin' up old shit?
She was cool with a girl I use to go with
But you can tell 'em both that it’s your dick
I bet they don’t know that you don’t even speak when you see me in the stree
But you still my little freak, girl
They don’t know, you don’t take pictures, are you blind?
Takin' light from lame bitches, man, why they so weak?
They don’t know, tonight we might be court-side
Me, you, and wifey
Two hundred on my neck, even though I got a check
She’ll fuck around and spend it on me

[Hook: Rico Love]
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know, they don't know
That we be in the same room
But we don't never say shit
Let's keep it between me and you
And we cool 'cause they don't know

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
How you feel about me, can’t live without me
They don’t know, ow that pretty thing cream when you think about me
(They don’t know, you’ve been staying in my condo 'bout a month
It’s a key up on your chain, when you goin' through some things, escape whenever you want
They don’t know, how I hit it by the fire
And your legs stretch wider and your chest gets tighter
They don’t know, that you’re stressed and you’re tired
But the stress gets lighter with the money that I wire
They don’t know
I like to put my lips on, kiss on every part of your body
They don’t know
Do it so well, baby who you gon' tell? Nobody

[Interlude: Rico Love]
Ladies and gentlemen, Tiara Thomas

[Verse 4: Tiara Thomas]
Give a bitch face a high five
I don’t know why she was lookin' at me side eye
I don’t even know why I’m sky high
I don’t even know why I’m high, is that a high crime?
But I gotta GIG of naked pictures that I’m ready to send you
If you just want relations, baby, there’s nothin' I can’t do
You said you lookin' for somethin' to get into
Well, I’m lookin' for someone to get into, oh
They don’t know you got me crazy and cravin'
And screamin' that I wanna have your baby
Posted all up in this bed, all up in my legs
Pulled in like thigh Mercedes, oh
They don’t know
They can’t hang if they don’t smoke
I don’t fuck with niggas if they don’t blow
And that ain’t no joke

[Hook: Rico Love]
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know, they don't know
That we be in the same room
But we don't never say shit
Let's keep it between me and you
And we cool 'cause they don't know

[Verse 5: T.I.]
Aye, they be all in your ear like "Why you stick around? Why you here?"
All he do is let you down, does he care how your smile disappear?
How many times you cried in a year?
Is it love, or the pride and the fear? Did you try to interfere?
How she gon' dive off a pier
With some concrete shoes on her heels? I’ll arrange that
Don’t they know they talkin' loud? Blowin' smoke when it’s clear
I’ll be standin' right here
Okay now, ever since we met, you done had the best
Wait a little longer, got better than that
Okay, I gave everythin' that I had in my check
Never held back, was you tellin' 'em that?
Man, I’m the answer to the question "Where them felonies at?"
Don’t have me waitin' for the cat like "Where the hell is he at?"
Ay, the love of my life, you gon' forever be that
Whoever questionin' that, I guess it’s clear to see that

[Hook: Rico Love]
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know, they don't know
That we be in the same room
But we don't never say shit
Let's keep it between me and you
And we cool 'cause they don't know
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know, they don't know
They don't even know I know you
You don't be talkin' like a lame bitch
You follow the rules but
We cool 'cause they don't know

[Verse 6: Emjay]
They don't know 'bout the time you came over on the late night
Told me you was worked up and after some good pipe
You got good brain but you gotta get your mind right
You sleepin' with him, when I'm in it, you say, "It's mine," right?
Always somethin' on your mind, right?
Tryna live in the spotlight
You fine right
You a cop with the cuffin', give me my ticket, I'll pay the fine right
Now you finally get it
All I need was 500 just for me to hit it
What you dealin' with at home ain't none my business
When I'm in your city, call me up and we can get it, oh
I got that flow from Meek Mill
But I ain't yellin' like Meek Mill
I got you blushin' baby, so stop frontin'
If I get you in that bed, I'ma have you yellin' like Meek Mill

[Hook: Rico Love]
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know, they don't know
That we be in the same room
But we don't never say shit
Let's keep it between me and you
And we cool 'cause they don't know
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know
They don't know, they don't, they don't know
They don't, they don't know, they don't know
They don't even know I know you
You don't be talkin' like a lame bitch
You follow the rules but
We cool 'cause they don't know

[Outro: Rico Love]
They don't know, they don't know what we doin'
Nah they don't know, nah they don't know
They don't, they don't know, oh, woah
'Cause they don't know
