[Verse 1]
When you need me, all you gotta do is call (do is call)
Believe me, all you gotta do is call (do is call)
Yeah that's cool, yeah that's cool, she say tell me what you want
Yeah that's cool, yeah that's cool 'til it's time to get involved
Told her she can holla when she need me
I know that I've never made it easy
I compromise a lot just to make it here
I'm scared to fall in love if we facing fear
Turned off all my phones and now they calling me at home
I done told 'em all that I just wanna be alone

[Chorus]
Come over
Can you come over? Yeah
Come over
And I know you're not supposed to but I need you close ooh
Come over
Even though we fell apart, don't you even start, girl you still got my heart
Come over
You know where I am, if you can't I understand
Won't you come over?
Won't you come over?

[Verse 2]
If you need it, tell me, baby, would you call?
So busy tripping, didn't catch you 'fore the fall
I made a lot of money, lost a lot of friends
I can't take this money with me in the end
I be on the road, you know I'm always on the go
Yeah, we been apart but this will always be your home

[Chorus]
Come over
Can you come over? Yeah
I want you to come over (girl, come over)
And I know you're not supposed to but I need you close, come over

Come over
You know where I am, if you can't I understand (understand)

So, won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come over?
Won't you come
So won't you come, won't you come

[Chorus]
Come over
Can you come over? (oh baby, I need you)

And I know you're not supposed to but I need you close
