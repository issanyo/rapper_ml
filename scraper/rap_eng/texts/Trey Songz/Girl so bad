E-Ever seen a girl so bad that a, a, a, a n, n, n, nigga might

Give her the keys, give her the keys

TREY SONGZ:
You can get the keys to the car(car)
You can get the keys to the crib(crib)
You can get the keys baby you can get the keys

Shawty you bad, but you know
Dancin in the club, drinkin on that nuvo
I, I can't control my eyes lay where ever you go
(Where you go, where you go, where you go, go)
What you think about if we leave
Baby if I pull up would you hop in with me
We can go create ourselve some fantasies
In my home, all alone

I don't wanna get to far ahead of myself
Baby I can picture you in bed with myself
So sip some more champange (champange)
And listen to my campaign
I don't think that you should be alone by yourself
I don't think you wanna be alone by yourself tonight
We can do it all night
And if you do it right

(CHORUS):
You can get the keys to the car(car)
You can get the keys to the crib(crib)
You can get the keys baby you can get the keys
You can get the keys to the car(car)
I just want the keys to your heart
Baby you can get the keys baby you can get the keys

Ferrari, maserati, the bugatti, the harley
I probably give it all to you
Shawty you bad, and you know (girl you know)
I'm a be on your ass if you go
I'll give you whatever baby girl that you know
That you know (that you know) Did you know (did you know)

I don't wanna get to far ahead of myself
Baby I can picture you in bed with myself
So sip some more champange (champange)
And listen to my campaign
I don't think that you should be alone by yourself
I don't think you wanna be alone by yourself tonight
We can do it all night
And if you do it right
(CHORUS):
You can get the keys to the car(car)
You can get the keys to the crib(crib)
You can get the keys baby you can get the keys
You can get the keys to the car(car)
I just want the keys to your heart
Baby you can get the keys baby you can get the keys

You can get the keys to the car(car)
You can get the keys to the crib(crib)
You can get the keys baby you can get the keys
You can get the keys to the car(car)
I just want the keys to your heart
Baby you can get the keys baby you can get the keys

LIL TWIST:
Young mula baby

You can get the keys right from the start just in case I go on tour and we stay apart
Bitch you sounded like a thief cause you stole my heart
And since I'm an artist you will be my art
And don't mind me go I got a huge ego it goes wherever we go
Cause our life is recorded relationships t-bo and money like JD so, so, so

Y-Y-Y-You can get the keys to the car
Drop topping batter boy now H.O.B to Mars (hey)
Cuz that's where I stay hey babe I'm in the game but don't play (Trey)

(CHORUS);
You can get the keys to the car(car)
You can get the keys to the crib(crib)
You can get the keys baby you can get the keys
You can get the keys to the car(car)
I just want the keys to your heart
Baby you can get the keys baby you can get the keys

You can get the keys to the car(car)
You can get the keys to the crib(crib)
You can get the keys baby you can get the keys
You can get the keys to the car(car)
I just want the keys to your heart
Baby you can get the keys baby you can get the keys
