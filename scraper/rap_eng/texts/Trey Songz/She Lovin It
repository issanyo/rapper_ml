[Verse 1]
She said that she didn't wanna be loved
I said, "Why the hell are you here?"
She said tonight she don't wanna be touched
And if that's the truth, why you so near? Oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
She kissing on me, she tugging on me
Oh, she want it
This girl is bad, bad, bad

[Chorus]
She lovin' it
I know she say that she don't but she do
She lovin' it
She let go and her body get loose
She lovin' it
Oh, you should see the way that she moves
She lovin' it
She lovin' it
She said she love it when I get her off

[Verse 2]
She said that she don't wanna be fucked
I said, "Why the hell are you sleeping naked?"
She told me she ain't ready, oh no
But that shy girl shit kinda overrated, uh, ooh na na

[Pre-Chorus]
She kissing on me, she tugging on me
Oh, she want it
This girl is bad, bad, bad
Got me all on her ass and

[Chorus]
She lovin' it (I know, I know)
I know she say that she don't but she do
She lovin' it (oh, ooh)
She let go and her body get loose
She lovin' it
Oh, you should see
Oh, you should see the way that she moves
She lovin' it (oh, ooh)
She lovin' it
She said she love it when I get her off

[Bridge]
And even though she said she don't
I know she do, I know she do
And even though those beautiful lips are telling me lies
I know the truth, I know the truth

[Chorus]
She lovin' it (I been kissin' on her body)
I know she say that she don't but she do
She lovin' it (hey, hey, hey)
She let go and her body get loose
She lovin' it (ooh)
Oh, you should see the way that she moves
She lovin' it
She lovin' it
She said she love it when I get her off
