Yea, yea
It gets lonely in this business, need a homie

Sittin' patient steady waitin', for the day when I can face it
The one that can love me for, who I am and so much more (is it you?)
You ma Bonnie (say that I) I found the one

So fine I go "that's my baby", so if you need me say "your my baby"
I'm a good man, who ain't got a lot to ask
Just lookin' for somethin' I can build on
I'm a young man, with a whole lotta cash
Just lookin' for a lady I can spend on
So all the young ladies in every little city
When I come to your town, let me know that you down
Sittin' patient steady waitin', for the day when I can face it
The one that can love me for, who I am and so much more (is it you?)
