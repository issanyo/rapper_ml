[Verse 1]
It's still ringing in my ear, you screaming "I don't care"
And I can see it like it just went down, me walking out of there
I still see 'em on your face baby, so many tears
And I remember feeling like I'm 'bout to explode, gotta get out of here

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like my sun won't shine, it's like my ride don't roll
It's like the only one thing I love don't love me no more
It's like my right gone wrong, it's like my ice gone warm
'Cause the only one thing I love don't love me no more

[Chorus]
If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a prayed instead of wishing, you'd still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could run that back, but in life you can't press rewind
'Cause the only way to fix this thang is to go back in time
'Cause if I had my way, yesterday would be right now
Instead of fighting we'd be making love 'til the sun go down

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like my sun won't shine, it's like my ride don't roll
It's like the only one thing I love don't love me no more
It's like my right gone wrong, it's like my ice gone warm
'Cause the only one thing I love don't love me no more

[Chorus]
If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a prayed instead of wishing, you'd still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again
If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a prayed instead of wishing, you'd still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again

[Bridge]
If I could just hold my shawty, if I could kiss my shawty
If I could get my shawty back
If I could just see you baby, if we could talk then baby
I would have my lady back

[Chorus]
If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping, you'd be here with me
If I'd a prayed instead of wishing, you'd still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again]
If I hadn't just slacked up on my pimping, calling you out on your name
If I'd a stayed instead of dipping, disrespecting my mane baby
You see Jesus would've told me something if I'd a called on him, still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like my sun won't shine, it's like my ride don't roll
It's like the only one thing I love don't love me no more
It's like my right gone wrong, it's like my ice gone warm
'Cause the only one thing I love don't love me no more

[Outro]
I keep thinking if, oh if, if I, you'd be here with me
I keep thinking if, oh if, if I, still be here with me
What good is if if you ain't here? Still be here with me
But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again
Won't bring you back again, it won't bring you back again
Ain't gonna bring you back
