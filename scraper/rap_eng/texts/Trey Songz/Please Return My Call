[Intro]
I'd do anything, just to hear your voice

[Verse 1]
It’s been too long, since I've seen your face
Since I smelled the fragrance of your perfume and I can’t get a hold of myself no more
I tried to play it cool, but I’m simply breaking, breaking down girl
And I need you to build me up again girl, build me up again

[Pre-Chorus]
I neglected you, expected you to stay forever, yes I did
Now you’re gone and I’m supposed to find another, no no

[Chorus]
Girl, I need you to please return my call 'cause I’m sorry
And I need to hear from you, I was wrong, that’s why I
Girl, I need you to please return my call, promise I regret it all, only we know what I’ve lost
I just wanna talk, so wherever you are, please return my call

[Verse 2]
Now I’ll give up anything, for the joy only your smile can bring
Just to see your face come through that door but until then, I’m gon' pray some more, yeah, I’m gon' pray some more
Pleads by the bedside 'cause you’re the best thing that happened in my life
And I gotta get you back and I’m dealing with the fact that I know

[Pre-Chorus]
I neglected you, expected you to stay forever, yes I did
Now you’re gone and I’m supposed to find another, no no

[Chorus]
Girl, I need you to please return my call 'cause I’m sorry
And I need to hear from you, I was wrong, that’s why I
Girl, I need you to please return my call, promise I regret it all, only we know what I’ve lost
I just wanna talk, so wherever you are, please return my call

[Bridge]
You know, baby I just need you to understand that my life is not worth living without you
And I know you’re mad, I know you’re mad
Better yet, I know you’re disappointed
And I promise I’ll do better, just pick up the phone

[Chorus]
Girl, I need you to please return my call 'cause I’m sorry
And I need to hear from you, I was wrong, that’s why I
Girl, I need you to please return my call, promise I regret it all, only we know what I’ve lost
I just wanna talk, so wherever you are, please return my call

[Outro]
Girl I need you to, please
