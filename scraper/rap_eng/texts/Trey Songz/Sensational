[Intro:]
Oh, oh, ooh
You are my
You know you my sensational, sensational girl
Sensational, sensational girl
Sensational, sensational girl

[Verse 1:]
Oh I love your love
I need now to be honest
Can I be honest baby
Had my share of girls
I’ve had a few
But they don’t compare to you

[Pre-Hook:]
Your kiss, your lips taste sweet as honey, darling
I just lose myself inside of you
Touch me, hold me, need me, keep me
Swear you’ll never leave me
And you’ll always be my

[Hook:]
Sensational, sensational girl, girl
Sensational, sensational girl, girl

[Verse 2:]
I can’t get enough of the things that you do
Take your time, don’t rush
Cause you know what to do to get me in the mood

[Pre-Hook:]
Your kiss, your lips taste sweet as honey, darling
I just lose myself inside of you, you
Touch me, hold me, need me, keep me
Swear you’ll never leave me
And you’ll always be my

[Hook:]
Sensational, sensational, girl, girl
Sensational, sensational girl, girl

[Outro:]
Here’s my love, put it in inside yours
Sensational
Forever be my sensational
Sensational girl, girl
