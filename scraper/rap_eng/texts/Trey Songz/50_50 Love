[Intro: Trina]
Sex is what I'm talkin 'bout, sex is what I'm talkin' 'bout, ah

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm not gonna hold on, no

[Hook: Trey Songz & Trina]
I ain't talkin' 'bout a 70/30, no way, no way
Or a 60/40, uh-uh, uh-uh
Talkin 'bout a 50/50 when the room is empty
And the clothes come off, I'm doin' you and you doin' me
I ain't talkin' 'bout a 70/30, no way, no way
Or a 60/40, uh-uh, uh-uh
Talkin 'bout a 50/50 when the room is empty
And the clothes come off, I'm doin' you and you doin' me

[Verse 1: Trina]
First thangs first, Miss Trina, ducks all the lames in the game
I'm quick to put a nigga to shame
For sayin' my name 'cause um that'll get you nowhere
But West Bubblefuck, with a kick in your nuts
So if you wanna hit the guts, then you gotta play your cards right
Go against the odds, cut me like I'm hard white
I train bitches like Tyko
To get the dick then the money out, these niggas goin' psycho
That's if you like a man, he kinda tight though
I don't give a damn, I'm tryna get you right though
Got vibes retired like David Rob
Heartthrob forever, cute and thicker than ever
Shit, you know you need a chick like me
Own cars, own house, own shit like me
Uh, see me and only me
I'm the real Queen of this shit, truly yours, "Baddest Bitch"

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm not gonna hold on, no

[Hook: Trey Songz & Trina]
I ain't talkin' 'bout a 70/30, no way, no way
Or a 60/40, uh-uh, uh-uh
Talkin 'bout a 50/50 when the room is empty
And the clothes come off, I'm doin' you and you doin' me
I ain't talkin' 'bout a 70/30, no way, no way
Or a 60/40, uh-uh, uh-uh
Talkin 'bout a 50/50 when the room is empty
And the clothes come off, I'm doin' you and you doin' me

[Verse 2: Trina]
Uh, you know I'm still in my prime
So, give me some lovin' I could feel in my spine
And do it to me like you said you would
Talk dirty but don't hurt me, do my body good
Show me love and give me hugs, let me cop a squeeze
Burn a few trees and let you get on top of me
Strength on that D, freaky deaky in the bedroom
I'm a lady by day, by night I need my legroom
Wanna let my hair down, get a glass of Chardonnay
I don't mean to drink it fast but homie, pardon me
Calm your nerves, I got you shakin', hyperventilatin
Lots of preparation and waitin' for the penetration
Concentratin' with every moment when we have relations
Sensations give me temptations, so gimme more, ain't no limitation
We love makin' in the late night
Ain't goin' home 'til the daylight, so fuck me right nigga

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
I'm not gonna hold on, no

[Hook: Trey Songz & Trina]
I ain't talkin' 'bout a 70/30, no way, no way
Or a 60/40, uh-uh, uh-uh
Talkin 'bout a 50/50 when the room is empty
And the clothes come off, I'm doin' you and you doin' me
I ain't talkin' 'bout a 70/30, no way, no way
Or a 60/40, uh-uh, uh-uh
Talkin 'bout a 50/50 when the room is empty
And the clothes come off, I'm doin' you and you doin' me
