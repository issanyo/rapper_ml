[Intro]
I still see us making love sometimes
I wake up in cold sweats
I wonder where you are
What you doing? I miss you
I think of you, I miss us

[Verse]
I remember that silly fight we had, soon as your mama left the house
Do you remember?
You said I won't quite the man that I used to be
And I didn't understand the words coming out your mouth
I remember
Every argument like yesterday
Still can't believe that you gone away, I can't believe it
And I know it's a choice that we both done made
That it was best for us just to break apart
But I wanna let you know that you're still in my heart
And you, baby you know
That you're still in my heart
Like a seed, let you grow
I still love you girl, no matter where you go
No matter where you are, no matter how far
I'm gon' be right there
If you need me, I'm right here
If you want me, I'm right here here here here
And all you gotta do is
