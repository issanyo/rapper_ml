[Intro]
Ladadadadada, mm
Whoa

[Verse 1]
Let me explain the way your love has got me feeling
I'm wanting to throw it away and hang up all the pimping
I'm ready to let go of my heart and give it all to you
For the rest of my life
It's like I can't roll or go with no one else but you babe
Nobody else can make me feel this way but you may
Be the only one I trust and baby that's what's up
I'ma tell the world about it, I'ma scream and shout it

[Chorus]
Girl you got that good kinda, good kinda
Sweet kinda, deep kinda loving
And girl you got that yeah baby, ooh baby
Keep it right there, I love it kinda loving
And girl you got that good kinda, good kinda
Sweet kinda, deep kinda loving
And girl you got that yeah baby, ooh baby
Keep it right there, I love it kinda loving

[Verse 2]
If you were music then you know I'd be the speaker
And if I was smoking then you know you'd be the reefer
And if I was standing on the block, I'd keep you in my sock
And that's for real
Girl, I can't see myself with no one else but you babe
Nobody else can make me feel this way but you may
Be the only one I love and baby that's what's up
I tell the world about it, I'ma scream and shout it

[Chorus]
Girl you got that good kinda, good kinda
Sweet kinda, deep kinda loving
And girl you got that yeah baby, ooh baby
Keep it right there, I love it kinda loving
And girl you got that good kinda, good kinda
Sweet kinda, deep kinda loving
And girl you got that yeah baby, ooh baby
Keep it right there, I love it kinda loving

[Bridge]
And I'll love you 'til ain't no loving better
Baby you the best, love you girl to death
And you can take my heart right out my hands
Got forever planned, got to be your man
So you ain't gotta worry 'bout this here
Girl I'll make it clear, long as love is near
You gon' be alright
With your kind of loving so right

[Chorus]
'Cause girl you got that good kinda, good kinda
Sweet kinda, deep kinda loving
And girl you got that yeah baby, ooh baby
Keep it right there, I love it kinda loving
And girl you got that good kinda, good kinda
Sweet kinda, deep kinda loving
And girl you got that yeah baby, ooh baby
Keep it right there, I love it kinda loving
