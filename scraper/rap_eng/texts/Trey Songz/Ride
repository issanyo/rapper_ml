[Intro: Ace Hood]
Cheah, Ace Hood
See mama, all I want you to do is hold it down for me
I want you to be my ride or die
While I go get this money, I promise I'ma get us out the hood baby

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
'Cause I ride, or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride, or die, we gon' make it out this hood

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Baby look, just ride with me, swear that I got us mama
One thing I love about it, see you ain't with that drama
You be my ride or die like Bonnie I'ma play the Clyde
Promise to move you out the hood into a bigger house
That's why you never trip, I'm grindin' bump a 9-5
Gotta get this money, paper callin' but you never whine
Gotta ask the cash come with bags, you should see your eyes
That's why I suprise about you stacks to ease your worried mind
'Cause when I'm gone, lil mama home alone at every time
You never blowed my phone up yet 'cause you respect the grind
And you never holla 'bout a problem, keep it all in line
My gutta baby, never maybe always gonna ride

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
'Cause I ride, or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride, or die, we gon' make it out this hood

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
And umm we can do them long vacations, thinkin' Jamaica lately
Can't take them deep relations, baby, just keep it patient
Shawty know what I do, shawty know who I be
You know I'm in these streets, the only way that we gon' eat
I keep it gutta, never cut her when we in them sheets
I get some cutta, grap the duffle then I'm in the streets
Come back with bundles, pimp a half a G and Louis V
But you ain't trippin', never question 'bout a nigga G
We keep it real, ain't no other that could fill ya sneaks
I ride for you, you ride for me, that's where we need to be
I hold you down, you hold me down and I fulfill your dreams
You're my Beyonce, I'm Hova, won't you ride with me?

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
'Cause I ride, or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride, or die, we gon' make it out this hood

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Now what's the definition of a rider?
Through it all, they gon' stand right beside ya
If you got one look 'em in the eyes
Tell 'em you gon' ride
Tell 'em you gon' ride, ride
'Til the wheel fall off or the day that I die
That's on my life, ain't nothing wrong with tryna love somebody
Tryna tell you shawty that

[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Ace, and I promise this to you, I'ma get us out this hood
Into them places that you thinkin' that you never could
But you gotta ride like them tires on the Mini Coop'
I'ma get this cash, paper bags and give half to you
Forget them haters, keep you tailored, see what's sexy too
And I like your body, all I think about is doin' you
And I love the money, so I guess it's like doin' two
You ride or die same smile when you see the loot

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
'Cause I ride, or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride, or die, we gon' make it out this hood

[Outro: Trey Songz]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we gon' make it out
We gon' make it out this hood, no
