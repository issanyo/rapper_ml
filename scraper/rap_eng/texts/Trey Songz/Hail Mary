[Intro: Trey Songz & Jeezy]
Woop, woop, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hail Mary, yeah, hail Mary, ah, hail Mary
It’s Trigga
Trig, what’s happenin’ nigga?
I got that game, I got that game
I caught a play, I caught a play
We going long, we going long
Do what I say, do what I say
I’ve got my game face on, yeah, yeah, yeah
My game face on, yeah
I got my game face on, come on

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I got my choppa in my ‘rari, in case I see my enemy
I don’t know what’s gotten into me, tonight I’m on this Hennessy
I won’t usually do the brown but tonight is special
Sam Rothstein, be my Ginger, yeah my special hoe
My 2 door is retarded, I call that bitch special-ed
I don’t even know her name, I just call her special head
Another year, same haters, usual suspects
Worried 'bout another nigga, I swear that shit is suspect
Keyser Soze, sold the yay’ and I got away
Hit the club, enter there fresh, in case I die today
Hail Mary, told her it’s the world, ain’t got shit to lose
’Bout to go long, celebrate, like I’m Victor Cruz

[Hook: Trey Songz & Jeezy]
Hey girl, you say you like it deep (Hail Mary), hail Mary
Hey girl, you know the play (Hail Mary), hail Mary

Hey huddle up, huddle up, hail Mary
Yeah, I ain’t tryna punt, tryna punt, hail Mary (C'mere)
Tonight we going long, we be going long (Hail Mary)

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Whatever you want I got it, got a drop-top in my pocket
You pop it you watch it, keep on poppin’ and I’ma drop it
So hard to be alone, any wanna go
But right here at this moment you the one I want to roll so
You got the ball baby, it’s in your hands
I’ma be the coach, I’ma let you know the play
What’s next is, baby you and me exitin’
What now? I’ma get you naked, do a little bit of sexin’, touch down
And once you let me score, I'ma wanna score again
Double O, triple O, baby I’ma play to win
You say the best offense is some good D
Hey girl, I heard you like it deep

[Hook: Trey Songz & Jeezy]
Hey girl, you say you like it deep (Hail Mary), hail Mary

Hey huddle up, huddle up, hail Mary
Yeah, I ain’t tryna punt, tryna punt, hail Mary (C'mere)
Tonight we going long, we be going long (Hail Mary)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi in this mutherfucker, Hail Mary, full of grace
I don't remember her name, but I remember how her pussy tastes
I go long, so long, she love the way that I put it down
Gotcha goin' in circles, all you gotta do is look around
I'm mister right and she miss tonight, pussy so nice gotta kiss it twice
Pussy so tight my tongue get stuck, my tongue get stuck like lickin' ice
Hoes call me QB, I throw that dick too deep
I told her shes the preacher's wife, she said practice what you preach
She said, "Ah me so horny, he love me long time"
I say, "How 'bout 69?" She say, "Numbers don't lie"
I say, "True you ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
And you know they say love is blind, so close your eyes"
