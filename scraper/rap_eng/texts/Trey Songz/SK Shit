[Trey Songs]
If it ain't stuck in yo head then I'mma beat it in
Runnin through the green like my last name Peterson
Tomlinson, Ladanian bitch this is my stadium
If they say defeat while in my leather seats I'm suede'n em
I fuck up..(backup) if ain't stuck in yo head then I'mma beat in
Runnin through the green like my last name Peterson
Tomlinson Ladanian bitch this is my stadium
If they say defeat while in my leather seats I'm suede'n em
I fuck'd up persuade'n em
Ballin in the game like a player that's created and
Three dikes and I'm fadin' em
Rap unleashin' demons yet I sing like I'm arcadian
Realest nigga living walk in a badd bitch and her body fake as shit
Super-Cali-Fragil-Istic-Expi-Ali-Docious
Think I might just call yo chick and say I want my toes kissed
Tell yo baby momma I will pay to get her nose fixed
Her breast too A B C D E F you I'm special

The best and you are errthing that's left of that
I'm gone take it all while you while you get whatever's left of that
I'm next at bat so throw that shit
I'm cold as shit you bogus bitch you know this shit is over with
Matter who you go and get all you niggas slow as shit
I turn these women on like my name was remote controller dick
Jumpin on this track
Such a locust diss the money shoutin' haters outta focus
Pussy niggas need to change their gender
Boy I'm colder than december
Your nothin' to forget and I am somethin' to remember
Eatin' this fuckin track like there were nothin' here for dinner
Attentions what we all want I am in the center
And its rightful I'm spiteful I found out who you wife'd fool
That's just to get up in her
Say they the shit but I run the sewer I'm master splinter
I only want for bitch niggas to exit when I enter
You see I am a major crash you just a fender bender
No contenders you so limber see I'm stiffted and my mistress
Is this rap shit

I came in with my main bitch we live in peace and harmony
But this rap ho flow so cold I swear its like she callin me
Fuck the way you thought of me I'm nothin like you thought I'd be
That's even if you follow me
Appreciative you oughta be cannot what you want of me
I'm mostly in the A that's if you wannabe's wanna see
I don't respect authority you can catch me overseas
Pretty women notice me and fall like some autumn leaves
Guess they think alot of me
Everything you oughta be
My money is a part of me so fuck you and your policies
Sometimes I get the feelin' I am the peoples property
Life is crazy complicated then I smoke alot of weed

Drink alot of liquor have alot of sex
Addictive lifestyle it'll prolly be the death of me
Hope my momma never hear this shit and then think less of me
You don't know how this pressure be I guess I got some stress in me
Times I wanna spaz show the world the Kanye West in me
But fuck it im'ma star the American dream
Like we not out and I.I. smoking the Canadian green
I'm higher than Aladdin and his arabian queen
Carpet in the sky told you I was fly
Came to knock em down so I love the way they lie
I run this enterprise got a complicated mind
And I dumb it down for you stupid niggas every time

I'm sicker every line they wish that I'd decline
But I stay on the grind baby bad brakes haters
I'm the shit won't you tell me how my ass taste
Ricky Bobby daddy say if you ain't first you last place
Movin' at a fast pace
You niggas is butts call em ash trays
Wanna be the mothafuckin' man you can ask Trey
Murder in the first my accomplice is
SK on the track we kill this shit
