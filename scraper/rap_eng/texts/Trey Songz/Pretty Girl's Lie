[Verse 1]
She grew up without a father
Never knew how to love a man
She's addicted to breaking hearts and moving on
Oh love, so I never really stood a chance, no
And a sparkle in your eyes, they shine so flawless
I'm amazed, blinded by an angel's face, oh
It's the sweetest poison in one kiss and now you got the venom in your veins
Believing everything her lips say

[Chorus]
Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile makes you wanna believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside, she can't even see
Pretty girls lie
Pretty girls lie

[Verse 2]
Got you walking through a maze, yeah
Eyes closed tryna find your way, ooh
Got your arms reached out, hoping she gon' make a sound
'Cause she don't wanna be found but she'll tell you come anyway, oh
And you don't know the difference from the real or the fake
Devil in a dress, but an angel in the face
They're forever yours but it's only for the day
Is it real when you calling my name?

[Chorus]
Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile makes you wanna believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside, she can't even see
Pretty girls lie

[Bridge]
Wanna give the benefit of the doubt
The best in her, I wanna help bring it out
I know something's missing inside
If she let me I can show and prove
Girl, it ain't no running from the truth
She says I'll be there
Girl, don't just tell me what I wanna hear

[Chorus]
Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile makes you wanna believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside, she can't even see
Pretty girls lie

[Outro]
Such a pretty face and she can't find her way
But you're a beautiful girl, lost in the world
Can't trust what she says
After so many break-ups and make-ups in life
Could've been making love but end up in a fight
Oh tell me why, pretty girls lie
