[Intro: Trey Songz]
I'ma do it just for tonight

It's your boy, none other than Tyrone
The mystical, elliptical, physical creature
Trey Songz on the beat
Ay, Aces tonight motherfucker, come here, hold up

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Spend that shit, spend that shit
You say that's your girl but that been my bitch
Fucked the whole world, come up in that bitch
Make her toes curl, lick her pussy lips
Yeah, spend that shit, spend that shit
Kill that pussy dead, leave no witnesses
Said that she my friend but it's benefits
Call her baby girl like she innocent

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Say that this your girl then we gon' call it borrow
I'ma kill it all night, get it back tomorrow
I'm still that nigga, don't you lame niggas forget that
Got her bustin' bustin' like a shotgun, it's kick back
When I'm in that shit, in that bitch
Talkin' dirty, whisperin' she love the dick
I just want a picture with me in this shit
Yeah, drippin' drippin', gushin', bustin' but she innocent
Oh, she love the way I fuck her
Ooh, I'm a nasty motherfucker

Money fallin' all over strippers in the busters

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I'ma spend that shit, spend that shit
You say that's your girl but that been my bitch
Fucked the whole world, come up in that bitch
Make her toes curl, lick her pussy lips
Yeah, spend that shit, spend that shit
Kill that pussy dead, leave no witnesses
Said that she my friend but it's benefits
Call her baby girl like she innocent

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Hol' up, stop countin' it for the cameras, nigga, spend that shit
All you lame Instagrammers, hope they suspend your shit
Where I'm from, they load hammers and spin that shit
And all the bitches love the scammers 'cause they spend that shit
I used to bang that bitch, but I had to end that shit
Now she hittin' on my bros on some way offended shit
If I ain't got no love for you, can't pretend that shit
If I ain't ask you for your hand, don't extend that shit
And I'm just stuntin' on my ex, hope I offend that bitch
Oh, that's your girl? I'm a savage, Kylie Jenner shit
I'm on some don't give a fuck where your boyfriend at shit
'Cause when I shoot my shot, nobody can defend that shit
Ay, I'm the friend that's lit, Benz that sit
Right outside the club that shout my name out soon as I open that bitch
Hoes takin' shots 'cause they couldn't make me spend that shit
Save that for them thirsty niggas where you bartend that bitch

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Spend that shit, spend that shit
You say that's your girl but that been my bitch
Fucked the whole world, come up in that bitch
Make her toes curl, lick her pussy lips
Yeah, spend that shit, spend that shit
Kill that pussy dead, leave no witnesses
Said that she my friend but it's benefits
Call her baby girl like she innocent
