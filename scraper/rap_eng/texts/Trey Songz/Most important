Now Shawty girl you like bail money
When I’m like down in the jail, honey
You set me free and I need that
The other half of me girl you be that
And girl I need for you to know this
See I’ma keep you warm in the coldest
Weather you can dream of
Baby you’re my dream love
The other couples trim us

[Chorus]
Do you understand just what you are to me, girl
Baby you’re the air I breathe
Baby you’re my everything, so listen to me
I need you to survive, I can’t lie
Girl I won’t ride, without you by my side
The most important part of my life is you, girl

Now let me tell you what the deal is
See baby you that girl and you the realest
Girl it ain’t none of this new to you
You say you gotta go, I move with you
Everything I loose, if you leave I’ll be a damn shame
Cause girl what’s left for me it’s not a damn thang
And lady I want you to know that
I’m giving you my heart, so baby hold that

[Chorus]
Do you understand just what you are to me, girl
Baby you’re the air I breathe
Baby you’re my everything, so listen to me
I need you to survive, I can’t lie
Girl I won’t ride, without you by my side
The most important part of my life is you, girl

It’s like the bottom of the night …
And girl I’m trying to hit a home run
I’m in the game with you I’m trying to win it
And I refuse to be alone, yeah
And I ain’t never gonna let you go
Cause you’re the most important part of my life
Girl, do you know, whoa, do you understand

[Chorus] X 2
Do you understand just what you are to me, girl
Baby you’re the air I breathe
Baby you’re my everything, so listen to me
I need you to survive, I can’t lie
Girl I won’t ride, without you by my side
The most important part of my life is you, girl
