[Intro: Ne-Yo]
Baby, don't go
Baby, don't go
Baby, don't go

[Verse 1: Ne-Yo]
She workin' Onyx but she say it's only temporary
It's been 3 years and she's still here and I was gettin' scary
Say she don't wanna dance forever
I look at her with my face like, why? Why?
She super sexy, everybody wanna know about her
The one that everybody want, but no one's ever got her
Because the way she get it in, all of the men
Even the women, all try, all try

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Shawty so incredible, oh
Body language she's a poet
She's so bad and what's so sad
Is she doesn't even know it
Little mama understands
The way you do the things you do nobody else can
And you could probably get whatever from whatever man
But shawty, do what's in your soul, still it'd be a shame to see you go

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
'Cause the way you move, ooh
Girl, the way you move
Girl, you got them like ooh
Girl, the way you move, girl, you so the truth
Can't take my eyes away from you
Girl, the thangs you do
Girl, you keep them like ooh
Baby, I love the way you move

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Girl, if this club was the sky, you're the brightest star
You ain't playing fair, slidin' down that pole like ooh
What? Drop a couple stacks on you,, that's nothin'
Hundred after hundred girl, a nigga ain't frontin', if you ain't in the club then I ain't comin', naw
She said she tired of all that bullshit
Gon' quit the game, change your life and ease your pain, mm
Hol' up, work so hard it's time to play
Baby girl, take it off for Trey

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo & Trey Songz]
Shawty so incredible, oh, if you want to leave girl
Body language she's a poet, ooh, you should come with me girl
She's so bad and what's so sad, you're the baddest thing up in here, dont cha know
Is she doesn't even know it
Little mama understands
The way you do the things you do nobody else can
And you can get whatever from whatever man
Baby, do what's in your soul, still it'd be a shame to see it go

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Ne-Yo]
'Cause the way you move, ooh girl
Oh, girl, the way you move
Ooh ooh, the way you do
You got 'em going ooh
Just the way you move, girl, you so the truth
Can't take my eyes away from you
And the thangs you do
Girl, you keep them like ooh
Baby, I love the way you move

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
Now, I never felt like this before
Which is why I brought some friends along to help me express it a little better
I got one more friend who I wanna talk to with a little bit more experience in this department
Pain, talk to her

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
I never seen nobody work it quite just like you baby
And I gotta tell you I'm startin' to like it baby
And it's crazy 'cause you don't wanna be here
I see it in your eyes, your eyes
Stop listenin' to them girls in that locker room
Just keep doin' your thing, don't let it stop you boo
And if you heard some things about me
Girl, they're all lies, lies

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo & T-Pain]
Shawty's so incredible
Body language, she's a poet
She's so bad and what's so sad
That she doesn't even know it
The more I drink the more you look like wife material
If you ready to roll with me girl, here we go
You hit the stage and then you make the music stop
Then your booty go, left chick, right chick

[Chorus: T-Pain & Ne-Yo]
Girl, I love the way you move
Got me like ooh
Girl, I love the way you move
Girl, I love the way you move, girl, you so the truth
Can't take my eyes away from you
It's the thangs you do
Girl, you keep them like ooh
Baby I love the way you move

[Outro: Ne-Yo]
Baby, don't go, ah
Baby, don't go, ah
Baby, don't go, ah
Baby, don't go, ah
Baby, don't go
