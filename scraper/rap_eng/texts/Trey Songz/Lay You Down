[Verse 1: Ron Isley]
Hey there, pretty lover!
I see you in a way like no other, no, no
And we know when lovers meet this close
There's something that we both share
Never been a better place, or a better time
And you got me feeling so good

[Hook: Ron Isley]
I wanna lay you down, oh, oh!
I hope you're ready now, this evening
And you've been kissing on me
And girl, I've been kissing on you too
Right now I wanna lay you down, oh, oh
There's no one else around to see me, this evening
You belong to me and girl, I belong to you
Let's do what lovers do yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
You ask, 'am I sure?'
And I say, 'girl I'm sure, more sure
Than I ever been, never been this sure, ever before!'
Oh, we know when
Lovers meet this close
There's something that they both share
I can only hope you feel the same
Do you feel the same, girl?

[Breakdown]
I'm so in love with you
I need love from you (I need love from you, girl)
You, you, girl, only you
You, baby, you!
Only you!
Baby, take my hand

[Hook: Ron Isley & Trey Songz]
I'm ready lay you down
I wanna lay you down
I hope you're ready now, this evening
You been kissing on me
And girl, I'll be kissing on you too
Right now I'm ready lay you down!
There's no one else around
Cause baby, you belong to me
And girl I belong to you
Let's do what lovers do!
