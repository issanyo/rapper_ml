Verse 1:

Nigga I’m educated
I ain’t talking no college
Nigga I never made it
I ain’t smoking no garbage
Nigga I’m hella faded
I make a movie you niggas
Just stick to picture taking
Paper making while your stories all fabricated
Bitches in my section with they asses shaking
She just obsessing, we sexin Montego Bay Jamaica
I’m killing everything ain’t no need for a respirator
I’m getting cheese my nigga I’m such a cheddar maker
I got a crib in the woods living on hella acres
I’m still good in my hood from 36 to Crater
Come get some money you can fuck them dirty bitches later
You looking bum and start your sentence with "I need a favor"
I bet I shit on these niggas who wanna make a wager?
I’m on my shit on you niggas, I’m 'bout that paper label
I came up on you niggas I’m like a elevator
Rest in peace Nate Dogg I’m bumping regulator
I’m bout my business and my business style is now and later
Look in the mirror I say fuck a hundred thousand haters
Just left the club and they paid a hundred thousand baby
Nigga remember when I used to have a silver RAZR
The flip phone told your baby mama call me later
Huh cut her yeah I cut her now she call me razor
She got a bag of some shoes I did your ass a favor
Another bitch in my crew but she love a pussy eater
Her name caramel I treat her like my favorite flavor

Verse 2:
Uh, she say she stay poppin when she rockin with her girlfriend
Okay that’s okay, yeah you just go and bring your girl in
She say keep going like we was going to the world end
Left it on her neck right next to where her mama pearls is
Bottles and sparkles they coming back to back to back and back and back
I’m flipping dollars my paper remind me of a acrobat
Shoot for the stars maybe I fuck the lady astronaut
Toast to the broads they get they paper with they asses out
I’m in Atlanta yeah in Atlanta like my old crib
I’m going hammer, I’m going hammer like some toes is
This niggas cowards, these niggas acting like some hoes is
I want the power you want to sell out like my show is
I probably love her, yeah I love her like my last bitch
Beautiful mother fucker just look how big her ass is
Shout to the bitches where all my bitches you a bad bitch
These bitches sour, these bitches sour like the patch kids
Wait for the moment it’s never coming like the past is
Na na the past isn't, you niggas past missing
I'm reality rich, you niggas cash wishing
Nigga my palms itching, niggas you all bitches
I’m a stop right there
Whoop!
