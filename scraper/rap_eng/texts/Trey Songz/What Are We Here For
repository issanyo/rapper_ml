[Verse 1]
What are we doing alone?
Time standing still just waiting for this moment
What are we holding on for?
Hesitating, both our hearts are open
Why would you wanna leave? Don't you feel secure?
Rest assured, I got you covered
Got your back taken for
Go the distance, nothing shorter

[Chorus]
What are we here for?
What are we here for?
What are we here for?
Let's be an example right now
We don't wanna regret this
What are we here for?
Don't say maybe later, then maybe turns too late, oh
What are we here for?

[Verse 2]
What are we doing alone staring up at the moon?
Know our night is waiting, oh yeah
Do you wanna go, do you wanna stay?
I see you contemplating
Why take a chance and drop the ball?
We got the world in our hands
If we're touching the sky, why would we land?
So you don't have to question, noo

[Chorus]
What are we here for?
Oh, what are we here for?
Oh, can you let me know?
What are we here for?
Let's be an example right now
We don't wanna regret this
What are we here for?
Don't say maybe later, then maybe turns too late, oh
What are we here for?

[Bridge]
What are we doing alone staring up at the moon?
Know our night is waiting, oh yeah
Do you wanna go, or do you wanna stay?
I see you contemplating

[Chorus]
Oh, what are we here for?
Yeah, ooh, I-I-I, what are we here for?
I just wanna know
What are we here for?
What are we here for?
Let's be an example right now
We don't wanna regret this
What are we here for?
Don't say maybe later, then maybe turns too late, oh
What are we here for?

[Outro]
