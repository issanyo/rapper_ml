[Intro: Trey Songz]
Say my name

[Verse 1: SoMo]
Baby, hold up, oh and turn it around for me
I’m feeling my luck, oh, so come and take a ride with me
You’re acting real playful, but I really know what you mean
You wanna go up and down and round for round and pound for pound, I’ll put it down

[Chorus: SoMo]
Tell me what's your favorite game
I wanna play hide and freak
You ain’t gotta cover up your eyes
Baby, come and play with me
Hi-hi-hide and freak
Hide and hide and freak
Play, play, play
Come play with, play with me
Hi-hi-hide and freak
Hide and freak
Come play with me, girl

[Verse 2: SoMo]
Presidential, that’s what the room is
Confidential, that’s what the mood is
And I’m feeling your body, feeling your heart, feeling your soul
Feeling it as we go up and down and round for round and pound for pound, I’ll put it down

[Chorus: SoMo]
Tell me what's your favorite game
I wanna play hide and freak
You ain’t gotta cover up your eyes
Baby, come and play with me
Hi-hi-hide and freak
Hide and hide and freak
Play, play, play
Come play with, play with me
Hi-hi-hide and freak
Hide and freak
Come play with me, girl

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Girl, you know you wanna play with it
Spend a couple days in it
Hope you been stretchin', I give you this blessin'
We touchin' and lovin', you bustin if Trey in it
Is it my turn to hide? Count to 100 by 5
5, 10, 15, 20, I be gettin' to it like the pussy was the money
Baby girl an addict and I'm just a dope dealer
Baby girl ride it like it was a four wheeler
Tell me, tell me you gon' catch it like the bus up on the block
Tell me you gon' bust it like ya car was in the shop
Remember round the way we play hide-hide and go get it
I know you with it
Oh girl, say my name, what's your favorite game?
What's your favorite game?

[Chorus: SoMo]
Tell me what's your favorite game
I wanna play hide and freak
You ain’t gotta cover up your eyes
Baby, come and play it with me
Hi-hi-hide and freak
Hide and, hide and freak
Play, play, play
Come play with, play with me
Hi-hi-hide and freak
Hide and freak
Come play with me, girl
Tell me what's your favorite game
I wanna play hide and freak
You ain’t gotta cover up your eyes
Baby, come and play it with me
Hi-hi-hide and freak
Hide and, hide and freak
Play, play, play
Come play with, play with me
Hi-hi-hide and freak
Hide and freak
Come play with me, girl
