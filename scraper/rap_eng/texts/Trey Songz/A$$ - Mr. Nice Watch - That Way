Mr. Nice Watch

Ah Mr nice watch ugh [x3]

Swear it's like a bad bitch just come with it
She said I should wear my Rollex

Versace shirt on the boat and Cole video
I'm big pimping, niggas know
Money in the envelope watch you niggas watching I
Always fuck with the paper even when the fucking center folds

It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, then time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back
So let's ball while we here, let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I make that back, I make that back
Uh nice watch! (Uh Huh)

Uh nice watch
No more Mr. Nice Guy, hello Mr. Nice Watch

Listen here bitch watch your mouth
This my shit and I'll kick you out
You so silly you so pretty
But I can't kiss you in your mouth
Same hoes now try to make the phone blow up
Wouldn't be around if the green ain't grow up
Lawnmower whores so it lawns over whores

You body like a rhyme I want to over flow you
Ain't want to fuck with your mind but I guess I overdosed you
And I'm so sorry and it so true

I apologize I don't recollect your name
Let me tell you that them heels really complement your frame
We can take them oh off
Then I gotta catch my plane
You say you miss me and you wishing for some private time
Girl how could we get that way [x2]
