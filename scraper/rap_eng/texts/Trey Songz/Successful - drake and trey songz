Money, money, cars, cars
Clothes, clothes, the hoes
I suppose, yeah

I want the money, money and the cars, cars
And the clothes, the hoes I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Drizzy, ah yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel you
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothings realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much will kill ya

And when I leave I always come right back here
The young spit'a that everybody in rap fear
A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game needs change and I'm the mofucking cashier

Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, ya hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD

Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Dis me and you'll never hear a reply for it
Any awards show or party I get fly for it
I know that it's comin' I just hope that I'm alive for it

I want the money, money and the cars, cars
And the clothes, the hoes I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late a lot of shit been goin' sideways
And my mother tried to runaway from home
But I left somethin' in the car and so I caught her in the driveway

And she cried to me so I cried too
And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2
And forty eight hours was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got pulled up

Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I neva have to fit in
So tryin' to keep up with my progress is like a dead end

My girl love me but fuck it, my heart beat slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week
So it's good but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want

I want the money, money and the cars, cars
And the clothes, the hoes I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was tryin' to put a ring on Alicia Hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin' like the pizza man

In person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treadin' waters steady tryin' to swim ashore
I'm on a shoppin' spree to get whateva is in store

Yeah, just call me "Shop And Bag Drizzy"
And call me "Mr. Damn", he ain't copin' that is he
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin' that you doubtin' is about to get busy

I'ma kill it, I promise this, I know you mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
To big homie use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin' for much, all I want is

I want the money, money and the cars, cars
And the clothes, the hoes I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

It's like I know what I got to say
I just don't know how to say it to you

Pardon the swag but bitches cartate
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake
How come I can't miss a woman
Like I can't miss court dates

Cheese but she's not in this portrait
Life's fine but I do not portray
I'm on the other side but it is a sharp gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo'ray

And I'ma fuck the world but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring her on to cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than shit
That's word to Toronto

So high up I got birds in the condo
Ain't that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her and she yell, God
Weezy baby, I go real hard, no further details, boy
