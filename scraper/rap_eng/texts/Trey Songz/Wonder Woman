[Intro]
I gave you prophecy on my first joint
Y'all lamed out
They ain't really appreciate it
The seconds ones out, Danja
Songz

[Verse 1]
Your face is amazin', blazin' hot like cajun
All I need is a minute, please no gimmicks
She tellin' me to chill on the real or take a trip to Satan
Send me to hell with it then I yell what it do, to hell with your crew
Say you got a man well to hell with him too
The seats is sea shell the whip is sea blue and you can swim through
Ain't a lot of women that I can't swim through
And you can't say that I don't temp you
'Cause if you you said that, you's a liar
Grip them legs back call me pliers, 24 chrome up under the tires
And you so grown and my desire's to make you cum
So finish that rum, ay who said Trey Songz ain't fire?

[Chorus]
The way you talking girl you seem so invincible
It's more than sexy girl, the way that you take control
I wonder woman are you my kind of woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?

[Verse 2]
It's a shame the way you do ya thang
You can't blame me starin' at your frame
What's your name? Baby they call me Trey
From the TV to the stage, the Prince of VA

[Pre-Chorus]
I got propers like doctors, I could change your life
You should stop watching and jockin' as if you ain't gon' ride
I wonder something baby we gon' do somethin' tonight
Tonight, oh

[Chorus]
The way you talking girl you seem so invincible
It's more than sexy girl, the way that you take control
I wonder woman are you my kind of woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?

[Verse 3]
What's this game? Baby I wanna play
What you say? Can't let you get away
'Cause I don't want to leave
Girl I only wanna be with you with you, with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I got propers like doctors, I could change your life
You should stop watching and jockin' as if you ain't gon' ride
I wonder something baby we gon' do somethin' tonight
Tonight, oh

[Chorus]
The way you talking girl you seem so invincible
It's more than sexy girl, the way that you take control
I wonder woman are you my kind of woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets, are you my wonder woman?

[Bridge]
I wonder 'cause I need a special kind of woman be side me
Are you my wonder woman? Come find me
We can do whatever woman, long as we together woman
This ain't a game, no
I need a super kind of woman beside me
Girl, I need a miracle
Anything is possible, make your body be my home
Let me cum inside and we gon' see if you invincible

[Chorus]
The way you talking girl you seem so invincible
It's more than sexy girl, the way that you take control
I wonder woman are you my kind of woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
Are you, are you my wonder woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets, [are you my wonder woman?
The way you talking girl you seem so invincible
The way that you take control
I wonder woman are you my kind of woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets, are you my wonder woman?

[Outro]
If we could be super friends in your world
It be so incredible
I can't help but wonder 'cause
With a back like that you fly like jets, are you my wonder woman?
