[Talking]
Baby it appears that you've... done something to me
And I don't know what you did
But you done did it girl
Yeah, you done did it

[Verse 1]
Ooh honey, I could have all the money in the world
But it wouldn't be nothing without you girl
And ooh baby you could offer me all the ladies in the world
But I don't want one cuz ain't none like my girl
And baby tell me how can I explain it
A love bullet went through my soul
You took my heart and rearranged it
And now you got full control
My mistakes and my bad ways
Girl you made a change in this man baby

[Hook]
I don't want to touch another
I don't want to feel another woman
Never gonna be another
I ain't gotta see another woman (Nobody but you girl)
Lover come close to me
Let me have my way do all I want
Put your body where its supposed to me
Ain't gotta worry 'bout me
Cuz all I want is to please, to kiss, to find a place inside
Your Love
I'll do whatever I need to find a place in your love

[Verse 2]
Ooooh you just got me feelin like a nigga need sexual healing
Ooooooh, oooh babe, oooh babe
Don't you go no further
Don't be no distant lover
No baby
And if you let me get it right here, right now I swear
When you let me get it inside you'll feel I care

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I just want to find a place baby
Inside of you, you, you, you
Let me get it right here right now
Baby girl I swear
If you let me get it
You gon' feel I care
Oh, Oh, Oh
You gon' feel I care
Wooahhh
Baby you gon' feel I care
Yes I care
