[Intro: Trey Songz & Justin Bieber]
Trey Songz et Justin Bieber, foreign
Les filles aux quatre coins du monde, profitez du son, ça va être un été chaud
Trigga and Bieber, this is the remix, JB
That's foreign, foreign, that foreign, foreign, that foreign, that foreign

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Let’s get goin' all you foreign, no complainin', early morning
Dominican, Puerto Rican, yeah, you know they do it for me
Have you seen that LaFerrari, ooh mama that thing is fun?
If it had some wings, we'd be flyin', we'd be soarin', ah
When I'm in it, I be thinkin' I don't want this thing to stop, no
But I'm thinkin' that you’re winnin' if you make it to the top floor
That probably means you make me feel some type of way
Shoutout Miami for having so many foreign babes

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & (Trey Songz)]
She only been here for two weeks
(Came with her girls) Came with her girls and they tryna leave with me
(She workin’ hard) She workin' hard like she tryna get a visa
(The way she twerk it) The way she twerk it I just might pull out my Visa

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Justin Bieber]
After we leave girl, you know where you going (Where you going)
Straight to the 'tel, you ain't leaving 'til the morning ('Til the morning)
Same old thing, yeah you know that shit's boring (That shit's boring)
American you know I had to cop that foreign (Cop that foreign)
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She got in that bikini when we in the Lamborghini
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She from another country, but I brought her to the city with me
I know it's never boring
American you know I had to cop that foreign, uh huh

[Verse 2: Trey Songz & (Justin Bieber)]
Just got back from Africa
I swear I saw 'bout 50 thousand queens (This is the remix)
Touched down in Paris, had her waitin', had her waitin' for me
Like ou la la la, oh oui oui, c’est la vie
Off up in the islands, screams turn to silence
All we do is fuck, drink, sleep
Hit it seven days 'cause you know your man's weak
Make your body talk, don't I make that thing speak? Such a freak

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & Justin Bieber]
She only been here for two weeks (For two weeks)
Came with her girls and they tryna leave with me
She workin' hard like she tryna get a visa
The way she twerk it I just might pull out my Visa

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Justin Bieber]
After we leave girl, you know where you going (Where you going)
Straight to the 'tel, you ain't leaving 'til the morning ('Til the morning)
Same old thing, yeah you know that shit's boring (That shit's boring)
American you know I had to cop that foreign (Cop that foreign)
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She got in that bikini when we in the Lamborghini
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She from another country, but I brought her to the city with me
I know it's never boring
American you know I had to cop that foreign, uh huh

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
And she be like "Ay, que rico" when I'm goin' real deep though
And you can give me all of them besos, just stay low, do what I say so
Fuck me now, oh damn, shawty go H.A.M, do with no hands
Got me so high, Holland, Amsterdam, Iceland, China, Tokyo, Japan

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Don’t understand when she speaks
But I break her body down, sheesh, just like the beat
Aye JB, what’s the word out on the street?
No matter who she's with, if she hear the remix

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Justin Bieber]
After we leave girl, you know where you going (Where you going)
Straight to the 'tel, you ain't leaving 'til the morning ('Til the morning)
Same old thing, yeah you know that shit's boring (That shit's boring)
American you know I had to cop that foreign (Cop that foreign)
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She got in that bikini when we in the Lamborghini
American you know I had to cop that foreign
She from another country, but I brought her to the city with me
I know it's never boring
American you know I had to cop that foreign, uh huh

[Outro: Trey Songz & Justin Bieber]
Cop that foreign, foreign
