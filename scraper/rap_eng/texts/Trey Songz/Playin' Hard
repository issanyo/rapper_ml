[Verse 1]
We just broke up this shit is kinda new
I admit I'll still be riding through
I heard you got another nigga too
I seen his Benz, that 2009 shit
Plus your homegirl outchea fucking, she let all my friends hit
That's off subject, I know, fuck it, bring them papers, keep them dutches
Tell 'em haters they some busters, bad bitch then I bags it
Like I work out in Publix, got plenty girls so many girls
And pieces of me love it but some pieces of me doesn't
Guess that's a players nature, guess I holla at you later
Are you really done, I mean really done with me?
You said you will be here counting millions with me
Now you gone
My baby's gone you're gone
And I want for you to come on home
I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't act that, fresh snapback
My cup is full of Hennessy, just me and my Bentley
Windows down got a joint rolled
Where I'm 'bout to go a nigga don't know

[Chorus]
But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard, I give up girl
Sick of fighting this war
'Cause I'm losing if I'm losing you
Can't shake, heart break, can't fake, baby wait
I'ma say it, I admit it girl, I've been a fool
Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of playing hard but that's something that I can't help
Fucking all these broads, I'm disgusted with my damn self
My back you would massage, I miss how your hands felt
But the show's goes on, and thats even if the band left
Catch me in Miami, Puerto Rican with a dancer
Talk is something sexy but I never understand her
Te amo mami but yo no se, I'm lonely mami, I'm not okay

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't act that, fresh snapback
My cup is full of Hennessy just me and my Bentley
Windows down anotha joint roll'd
Where I'm 'bout to go a nigga don't know

[Chorus]
But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard
I give up girl, sick of fighting this war
'Cause I'm losing if I'm losing you
Can't shake, heart break, can't fake, baby wait
I'ma say it, I admit it girl, I've been a fool
Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard

[Bridge]
I'm so sick of fronting like I don't miss you when you leave
And laying in bed at night, you even sexy girl, when you sleep
Feels a little crazy lying here alone
But I'm stuck on that nigga shit
That I be on, that I be on
And it's that nigga shit
That got me smoking, driving, drinking
Girl, I'm tripping, blowing up your phone

[Chorus]
But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard
I give up girl, sick of fighting this war
'Cause I'm losing girl
Can't shake, heart break, can't fake, baby wait
I'mma say it, I admit it girl, I've been a fool
Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard

[Outro]
So uh, sick of playing hard
Yeah I'm just sick of playing hard
Without you feels a little crazy
Yeah, yeah, just, I just
I'm sick of playing hard
