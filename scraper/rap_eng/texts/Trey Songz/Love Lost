[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Reminiscing, I remember me and you we used to play with the dogs
While you were sleep I'd stare, stare while you lay in my arms
And now I'm stuck on stupid, rain forest couldn't get wetter than you get
I used to beat it up, you gave me your love, I abused it, now I'm facing the music

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how I yearn for your touch
I'm so lonely now that you left me
If I could run away, you know I would
And I'm hurting 'cause girl, I never loved you like I should

[Chorus]
When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need don't need you
What do you do, when love is lost?

[Verse 2]
I was tripping, wouldn't listenm now I'm sitting, sipping shots at the bar
Now I'm riding to the 90's hits, listening to Aerosmith
"I don't wanna close my eyes, don't wanna fall asleep "
Tell me how I can I be fly without the wind beneath my wings? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how I yearn for your touch
I'm so lonely now that you left me
If I could run away, you know I would
And I'm hurting 'cause girl, I never loved you like I should

[Chorus]
When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need don't need you
What do you do, when love is lost?

[Bridge]
And now I see the man you need
When I look into the mirror I see change
And I close my eyes and wish you could see the same
But it's too late

[Chorus]
When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need don't need you
What do you do
When your love is lost
Your whole worlds thrown off
When the one you need don't need you
What do you do, when love is lost?

[Outro]
Gone out the window
When your love is lost
Can't see your love no more
When the one you need don't need you
What do you do, when love is lost?
