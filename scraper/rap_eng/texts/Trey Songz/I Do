[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo

[Verse 1]
Ruth Cris with them Juice Lips, XO you take two sips
Puff the dro, you take two hits, my show, you get four tickets
Three friends that you roll with, ya got little sisters that want pictures
Two seats, when I roll with ya, top back, let the wind hit ya
You know I'm the man round these parts here
You know, don't you know, if you need something, I’m here? Yeah
Baby meet me downtown, we gon' get your hair done
You say all your gas gone, I’m gon’ fill your tank up
Fill that piggy bank up, care 'bout no recession
While you second guessing, answer this one question

[Chorus]
Now when you with that other nigga, is you with a winner?
He don’t do it like I do
If you say I ain’t on yo mind when y’all spending time
Girl you telling lies, gon’ and testify
He don’t do the thangs, he don’t do the thangs no
He don’t do the thangs I do
Girl, you know he don’t hit it right, you living a lie
He don’t do the thangs I do

[Verse 2]
Penthouse suites for 'bout four weeks, private beach with them palm trees
You can buy it all in the Beverly, show you thangs, he’ll never see
Even let you drive my Bentley, though you love him
You, he don’t deserve
Listen, I’m the man round these parts here
You know you know that
Dont you know, if you need something, I’m here?
But let me ask you this one question

[Chorus]
When you with that other nigga, is you with a winner?
He don’t do it like I do
If you say I ain’t on yo mind when y’all spending time
Girl you telling lies, gon’ and testify
He don’t do the thangs, he don’t do the thangs no
He don’t do the thangs I do
Girl, you know he don’t hit it right, you living a lie
He don’t do the thangs I do

[Bridge]
I’m only here, to show how much I care
And I know you’re having second thoughts
About your love at home
You need to let that go
I’m tired of seeing you hurt and cry
When you know inside
He’ll never be the man that I'm, oh
He don’t, do the thangs, I do
He don’t

[Chorus]
When you with that other nigga, is you with a winner?
He don’t do it like I do
If you say I ain’t on yo mind when y’all spending time
Girl you telling lies, gon’ and testify
He don’t do the thangs, he don’t do the thangs no
He don’t do the thangs I do
Girl, you know he don’t hit it right, you living a lie
He don’t do the thangs I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
When you with that other nigga, is you with a winner?
He don’t, do the thangs I do
Do, yeah, you know
