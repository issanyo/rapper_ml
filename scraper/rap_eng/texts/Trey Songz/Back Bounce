[Chorus]
I got that work
That shoop that'll make your back bounce (you gotta believe me, baby)
Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl
I'ma make your back bounce, bounce

Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl
I'ma make your back bounce, bounce

[Verse 1: Brandon Hines]
What's the problem? Baby, why you fronting?
Don't act like you ain't looking, baby girl, I'm stunting
I can see you the type t at like to be pampered
I got paper, baby, I can get you what you want and
That loose, baby, get your body working
Work on me hard like you feeling like you certain
I'ma break you off when I get you home
Have your eyes rolling back, kiss you all in the zone

[Chorus]
I got that work
That shoop that'll make your back bounce (you gotta believe me, baby)
Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl
I'ma make your back bounce, bounce

That shoop that'll make your back bounce (you gotta believe me, baby)
Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl
I'ma make your back bounce, bounce

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
They call me Songz, baby, but you know who I is
I get a lot of cash, I handle my biz
I get a lot of ass and I do it real big
I hit it from the back, you can feel it in your ribs
Tell me what it is 'cause baby, it ain't nothing
I'm looking at your friend and she saying you fronting
I got my boy with me, next day, next city
But tonight, we trying to get busy

[Chorus]
I got that work

Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl

[Bridge: Brandon Hines]
That's the way I like it
That's the way that I like it
Oh, no
No, girl, please don't you stop it
Let it bounce, let it bounce
'Cause you're showing things I've never seen
So bring your body to me
So...

[Chorus]
I got that work
That shoop that'll make your back bounce (you gotta believe me, baby)
Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl
I'ma make your back bounce, bounce
I got that work
That shoop that'll make your back bounce (you gotta believe me, baby)
Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl
I'ma make your back bounce, bounce

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Yeah, baby, I'm 'bout to shoop inside you
Grip tight on that ass, tighter than pliers
Huh, When I shoop behind you
Body be aching. waiting for somebody to find you
I got that work, that shoop, I remind you
I ain't talking hard work when I say grind her
I'm talking 'bout the business, I live this, I give this
And once I twist it, you'd be happy that we did this

[Bridge: Trey Songz, Brandon Hines & Both]
That's the way we like it, girl
That's the way, that's the way
No, girl, please, don't you stop it
Let it bounce
Let it bounce, let it bounce
'Cause you're showing things I've never seen
So bring your body to me
So...

[Chorus]
That shoop that'll make your back bounce (you gotta believe me, baby)
Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl
I'ma make your back bounce, bounce
I got that work
That shoop that'll make your back bounce (you gotta believe me, baby)
Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl
I'ma make your back bounce, bounce
I got that work
That shoop that'll make your back bounce (you gotta believe me, baby)
Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl
I'ma make your back bounce, bounce
I got that work
That shoop that'll make your back bounce (you gotta believe me, baby)
Don't get yourself hurt and worn out, little girl
I'ma make your back bounce, bounce
