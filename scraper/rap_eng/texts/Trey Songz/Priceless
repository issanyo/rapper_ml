[Chorus]
Girl, your love is priceless
One thing I can't afford to lose
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby
'Cause girl, your love is priceless
Flying in all the jets I flew, yeah
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby

[Verse 1]
I got more gold chains than these dope dealers (I look like I'm whippin')
And I can't relate to these broke niggas (I don't understand)
I pull out my driveway, only 12 cylinders (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Thank God it's a new day and I'm still killing 'em (uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But none of it don't matter, baby, no
If you ain't waiting there when I get home
'Cause I can't spend this money on my own
I need my queen to take her throne

[Chorus]
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless
One thing I can't afford to lose
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless
Flying in all the jets I flew, yeah
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby

[Verse 2]
Been around the world, seen a lot of women (I seen 'em all)
That's how I know you one in 100 million (girl, you the one)
Everything that I wanted (I wanted), if I seen it, I bought it (I bought it)
Pockets jumping like Jordan right now (jumpin', jumpin', jumpin')

[Pre-Chorus]
But none of it don't matter, baby, no
If you ain't waiting there when I get home
'Cause I can't spend this money on my own
I need my queen to take her throne

[Chorus]
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless
One thing I can't afford to lose
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless (love is priceless)
Flying in all the jets I flew (I flew), yeah
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby

[Bridge]
I'd trade in the Wraith and buy you diamond rings (diamond rings)
Baby girl 'cause I know you like shiny things (shiny things)
Whatever you want, oh, you can have that (have that)
Pull up in the mall, oh baby, grab that (grab that)
These girls, they ain't got nothing on you at all (nothing, baby)
'Cause your love is too priceless, don't care what it cost, no no
'Cause money, it don't mean a thing, you know I got enough of it
What I'm tryna say is you can get it, anything you want from me
My baby, you worth all of that and more

[Chorus]
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless
One thing I can't afford to lose
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby
'Cause, girl, your love is priceless (love is priceless)
Flying in all the jets I flew (I flew), yeah
And even though I ball, I would trade it all
To keep you in my arms, baby
