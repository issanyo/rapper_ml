[Intro]
Holla, whoa, woah, woah, woah oh
Whoa, woah, woah, oh
I know it's been a minute since we really kicked it but
I just want you to know, uh

[Verse 1]
I can't pretend that everything's all good
Nope, I can't say that everything's all bad
But I'm gon' say that you be on my mind
How you doing, who you with, where you be at?

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, we've had our share of ups and downs
But you know that I'm gon' always be around, that's fo sho
And you know how we do, how I roll
And remember ain't a damn thing changed

[Chorus]
So holla if you need me, you always gon' be my boo
Holla if you need me, you know I still got you
If you ever need me to be, what you need
Girl, I'm free and forever you can holla at me
So holla if you need me, you always gon' be my boo
Holla if you need me, you know I still got you
If you ever need me to be, what you need
Girl, I'm free and forever you can holla at me

[Verse 2]
I still be thinking 'bout the things you do
I still be thinking 'bout the times we had
Don't wanna seem like I've be missing you
But I am and damn, it's bad, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, we've had our share of ups and downs
But you know that I'm gon' always be around, that's fo sho
And you know how I do, how I roll
And remember ain't a damn thing changed
