[Verse 1: Rebstar]
As soon as I enter the crib, I'm sensin' a bad vibe
No welcome home kisses, even though it's been a while
And you tryna play it off but I can see clear through the mirror
I'm lookin' straight at your face boo and it's missin' a smile
'Cause your girlfriends say they spotted me, exchangin' some kisses with some bitches
Up in my business while exchangin' some digits
But you know that these chicks are vindictive, they trippin' any chance they get
And I know everythin' we've been buildin' breaks if it gets through your head
We go from trust to issues to what I do after shows
I always got an excuse to not come home
And you always got an excuse to look through my phone
And hate on every person that I meet on the road
She says things are not the same in so many ways
I've been rollin' with some snakes since my trendy days
And she never let it phase but that's what she says
That they offend me with envy, right through the Fendi shades

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Can't let a good thing go down the drain
Hey girl, it's ups and downs but we gotta maintain
I know it get hard out there, hard out there
I know it get rough out there, oh
But you can't leave, I can't do this without you
Hey you can't go, I can't do this without you
There's one thing you must know, I can't do this without you
'Cause baby, I need you by my side, I can't do this without you

[Verse 2: Rebstar]
You suddenly threatenin' to leave, packin' your LV's
And handin' me your jewelry, tellin' me to sell these
'Cause it's like the fifteenth time I'm beggin' on my knees
We fallin' in and out of love like Alicia Keys
But I, thought you grasped the difference between real and fake
Granted I, understand the fact that I'm not in your Marc Jacobs
I know the lies and rumours are factors behind break-ups
Don't let them tears run down your cheeks and ruin your make-up
On the real, for real? For real, I just want to sit and chill with ya
Listen to build with ya, gettin' to know what's the deal with ya
But you miss the picture baby, 'cause you're tellin' me you're hurt
Word, I hurt you so you hurt me back so I can feel with ya'
Things are not the same in many ways
You go on and on and on 'cause nothin's the same
I ride along, along, along there's nothin' to gain
But I'd throw away the fame, anytime, any day

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Can't let a good thing go down the drain
Hey girl, it's ups and downs but we gotta maintain
I know it get hard out there, hard out there
I know it get rough out there, oh
But you can't leave, I can't do this without you
Hey you can't go, I can't do this without you
There's one thing you must know, I can't do this without you
'Cause baby, I need you by my side, I can't do this without you

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
We've been through too much to let it all just slip away
Remember how I used to be a shelter in the rain
And I know that I've been wrong, just let me make it right
Baby, won't you come back home, if only for tonight?
I will cherish every moment you're here, still

[Hook: Trey Songz]
