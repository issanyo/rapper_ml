Oh-oh-oh- Oh
Oh -oh
Oh- oh- oh

So Many Memories In My Mind
Ive Erased Like a page in a book I Written untold
So many women walk on my arm Cause the charm I put on
I Admit I Left A Bunch Of Them Swoon
Standin In A Room Full Of Mirrors Yelling
But its like they can hear When I say

I Gotta Stone Heart In My Chest
I Can't Feel No Pain
I'll never love another women
Its Just Me And My Money
I Think I Took A Shot In The Vein
Like Novocaine Novacaine
Novacaine Novacaine
Like Novacaine

Ain't enough fingers for the times that i lied
Can't even remeber last time that i cried
But i cried oh ! did i......i......
Ain't no turnin back o this road

Busy chasin stacks & the hoes
Affection is a person i don't know
Living in a world so cold

I Gotta Stone Heart In My Chest
I Can't Feel No Pain
I'll never love another women
Its Just Me And My Money
I Think I Took A Shot In The Vein
Like Novocaine Novacaine
Novacaine Novacaine
Like Novacaine

I Gotta Stone Heart In My Chest
I Can't Feel No Pain
I'll never love another women
Its Just Me And My Money
I Think I Took A Shot In The Vein
Like Novocaine Novacaine
Novacaine Novacaine
Like Novacaine
