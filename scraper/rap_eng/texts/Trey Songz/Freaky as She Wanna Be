[Verse 1: Jizzal Man]
She be herself around me, freaky as she wanna be
Give me Georgia Dome like I'm sittin' off at The Omni
And I enjoy it, makin' lil noise
Stayin' ready for it, y'all already know it
She swallow it, gobble dick, lil bitch from Memphis
In love with my cock, she give the jimmy a French kiss
Her favorite position is doggy stylin' in the bunk
And the places she likes it is on the couch or in the trunk
And I bang on the pussy like a motherfuckin' door knock
Like the Flintstones, yeah, makin' the bed rock
It's group fun, believe she do what she do, son
Give you some, and you some, and you some, and you some
It ain't no fun if my homies can't have none
She winked her eye, blew a kiss, stuck out her damn tongue
You know that she ready, yeah remove the bed spread then
Give a lil head then, get on in the bed then

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She freaky as she wanna be, believe it, I'm freaky as I wanna be

Freaky as she wanna be
She freaky as she wanna be, believe it, I'm freaky as I wanna be
Poppin' what's in them Vicky's, no secret, I'm freaky as I wanna be
If you a lady in the streets, straight freak in the sheets
Freaky as she wanna be

[Verse 2: Pimpin]
What's in the club, posted like King Tut
Rollin' like a fool lookin' for me some cut
Who the type booze, King cover type butt
Nice head on her shoulders and the bitch'll give it up
Body shaped like Budweisers
Classy hoe that liked to be pile driver
D.D.T. the bitch, I can go for some hours
Let Parlae hit, together we like twin towers
What you thought, that I wine, dine, show you thangs?
I'm the type of nigga let ya suck where my chain hang
If you don't suck then you can lick where my chain swang
Be freaky as you wanna be, promise I can maintain
Gotta know ways and tricks to make this dick spit
Flip jack, suck on the dick like a sip stick
I got a lot to offer
But for you it's good wood and makin' chicken and waffles, bitch

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She freaky as she wanna be, believe it, I'm freaky as I wanna be
Poppin' what's in them Vicky's, no secret, I'm freaky as I wanna be
We in the bed no sheets, head to the feet
Freaky as she wanna be
She freaky as she wanna be, believe it, I'm freaky as I wanna be
Poppin' what's in them Vicky's, no secret, I'm freaky as I wanna be
If you a lady in the streets, straight freak in the sheets
Freaky as she wanna be

[Verse 3: Buddie]
She freaky as she wanna be and she know she thick with it
Hangin' off the celiing fan, she like to do some tricks with it
DFB bitch, so ya gotta let the click hit it
If Buddie hit from the back, ya gotta suck a dick with it
How ya meet a groupie hoe? Who know what the deal is?
Askin' where the purp, where the Goose, and where the pills is
Call me Dave Hollister, caught is what I wanna be
She suckin' and she fuckin' 'cause she freaky as she wanna be
Ten next up, so ya know we ain't finished yet
I don't wanna fuck though, I want me some pigeon lip
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Do it with no hands
I say do it with no, do it with no, do it for my man

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She freaky as she wanna be, believe it, I'm freaky as I wanna be
Poppin' what's in them Vicky's, no secret, I'm freaky as I wanna be
We in the bed no sheets, head to the feet
Freaky as she wanna be
She freaky as she wanna be, believe it, I'm freaky as I wanna be
Poppin' what's in them Vicky's, no secret, I'm freaky as I wanna be
If you a lady in the streets, straight freak in the sheets

[Verse 4: Parlae]
Now she freaky as she wanna be, grabbin' on the wood
'Cause it's good and she wanna see bein' all up on it G
Had to write this rhyme 'cause I think this hoe is punkin' me
She's punkin' me, 'cause she a freak and she do everything
That pussy ain't shit, but that mouth like a hurricane
She keep her hair fixed and I fucks it up
When I bust a nut, she grab the dick and she sucks it up
Bring to the ten and she do the team
She a ghetto bitch, all she want is hot wings
Naw nigga, she like the way a nigga ice bling
She's a good girl, nope she's a actor
In a room alone, she'll suck a dick backwards
Pop my balls in her mouth like she popped some capsules
I like 'em easy, not them kind that like to wrestle
They choose us 'cause a nigga is a rapper
Fuck 'em good and straight get ghost just like Casper

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She freaky as she wanna be, believe it, I'm freaky as I wanna be
Poppin' what's in them Vicky's, no secret, I'm freaky as I wanna be
We in the bed no sheets, head to the feet
Freaky as she wanna be
She freaky as she wanna be, believe it, I'm freaky as I wanna be
Poppin' what's in them Vicky's, no secret, I'm freaky as I wanna be
If you a lady in the streets, straight freak in the sheets
Freaky as she wanna be

[Outro: Trey Songz]
She do it how I want her to do it, I'm freaky as I wanna be
She move it how I want her to move it, I'm freaky as I wanna be
She calls, say she ready to see me, I'm freaky as I wanna be
She get down, ready to freak me, I'm freaky as I wanna be
Do that there, yeah
Said she do that there, I say she doin' that there there
Baby, ya doin' that there
You be as freaky as ya wanna be
