[Intro]
Never wanna make u cry
Never wanna make those tears come to your eyes

[verse 1]
I know it's been hard between us
U don't know who you can trust
But girl it's me
Cuz what we had was more than just lust
It seems that we always quarrelin'
But that don't mean a damn thing
Just as long as we always have an understanding

[Bridge]
So put all of your burdens on the side
Cuz i'm gonna take you on a ride
And forget your pride
I never want to hurt you lady
So just come and hold me honey

[Chorus]
I wanna make you mine, all the time
Thats no lie (thats no lie)
I wanna make you mine, all the time
Thats no lie.....Aw girl
Never Wanna Make U Cry
Never wanna make those tears, come to your eyes

[verse 2]
You think that i really don't love you
That could never be true
Cuz no matter what i'll always be real to you
So tell me where to lay down my life
Without you i'm ready to die
Cuz it's so hard for a man to express his true love

[Bridge]
So put all of your burdens on the side
Cuz i'm gonna take you on a ride
And forget your pride
I never want to hurt you lady
So just come and hold me honey

[Chorus x2]
I wanna make you mine, all the time
Thats no lie (thats no lie)
I wanna make you mine, all the time
Thats no lie.....Aw girl
Never Wanna Make U Cry
Never wanna make those tears, come to your eyes
