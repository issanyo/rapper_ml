[Intro]
Relax, relax
Make your mind
Take your mind with me

[Verse 1]
I'm on my way home
About to hit the exit, do you need some?
'Cause I know you had a long day, whoa
Do you miss me? 'Cause I miss you
And that sexy little thing you make your lips do
Way your hips move, keep me thinking 'bout the love I wanna give you

[Pre-Chorus]
You deserve the world if I could give it
Stars would come to you and ask permission to shine
'Cause only you shine

[Chorus]
And tonight I got your, neck, shoulders, back
Baby, I'ma touch on all that
Once I pull in the garage
Once I hop up out the car
I'ma relieve your stress, yes, baby, fall back
Tonight I'm gon' be working all that
Lose the panties and the bra, take 'em off
I'ma start with a massage
From your head to your toes, massage

[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, girl. cut off the TV, oh, oh, get, the room ready for me
Pull the shades down, turn the lights low
I'mm get the oil and the towel
I'm so close, I'm almost
About to turn the corner down our road
Fact I'm in the driveway now

[Pre-Chorus]
You deserve the world if I could give it
Stars would come to you and ask permission to shine
You the only one who shine in my world, 'cause only you shine

[Chorus]
And tonight I got your, neck, shoulders, back
Baby, I'ma touch on all that
Once I pull in the garage
Once I hop up out the car
I'ma relieve your stress, yes, baby, fall back
Tonight I'm gon' be working all that
Lose the panties and the bra, take 'em off
I'ma start with a massage

[Bridge]
From your head to your toes
Girl, I promise I'ma go
From your toe to your head
Baby, scream if you need more
Oh, and I'll take my time
Rubbing up and down all night
Just let me know
Where you want my hands? I'ma put 'em on ya
Anywhere they land, baby, let me warn you now
Once I lay you down

[Chorus]
Promise you gon' feel it from your, neck, shoulders, back
Baby, I'ma touch on all that
Once I pull in the garage
Once I hop up out the car
I'ma relieve your stress, yes, baby, fall back
Tonight I'm gon' be working all that
Lose the panties and the bra, take 'em off
I'ma start with a massage
From your head to your toes, massage
I'ma rub you down right now from your, from your
From your head to your toes
And anywhere you want me to go
Promise I got ya
From your toes to your head now
Head, shoulders, head, back

[Outro]
Just relax
Lay your body back
I give you a massage
