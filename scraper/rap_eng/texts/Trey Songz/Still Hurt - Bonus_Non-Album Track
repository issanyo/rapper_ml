It doesn't matter who creepin first
It don't matter who be the worst
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt
You don't tell what you peeped or heard
Cause you know you did deeper dirt
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt
Ever think what your girl doin when you're gone
Never think she could be doin somethin wrong
Cause she say she satisfied and happy with the life
But still you get a vibe cause you know you ain't right
I can look my woman straight into her lovely face
And she can play along like everything is AOK
Cause she know what I'm doin' but it's all part of the game
Plus I know that she's cheatin anyway
But does matter
It doesn't matter who creepin first
It don't matter who be the worst
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt
You don't tell what you peeped or heard
Cause you know you did deeper dirt
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt [Repeat]
I can't imagine us bein' apart
Like a thousand drums is beatin' on my heart
When she be givin 'way what I coulda swore was mine
But who am I to say when I do it all the time
Cause I can look my woman straight into her lovely face
And she could play along like everything is AOK
She know just what I'm doin' but it's all part of the game
Plus she knows that she's cheatin anyway
But does it matter
It doesn't matter who creepin first
It don't matter who be the worst
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt
You don't tell what you peeped or heard
Cause you know you did deeper dirt
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt [Repeat]
Guess the moral of the story don't cheat
And if you got a man or woman don't creep
I know she fine as hell nigga don't beat
But if she fine as hell nigga gon' keep her
And if you wanna get it on girl do it
Cause believe me I don' been through it
But if you love what you got
And you keep steppin out watch out cause you might just lose it
