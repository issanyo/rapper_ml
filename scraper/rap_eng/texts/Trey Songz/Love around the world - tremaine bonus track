Baby girl I left a piece of my heart
In New York, in L.A
Baby 'cause I left a piece of my heart
In Paris, in London

I've made love
Love around the world, love around the world
Love around the world
I've made love
Love around the world, love around the world
One too many girls
I can't expect to get my heart, to get my mind
To get me soul, getting my everything
When I already gave it to her
I can't expect to get my heart, to get my mind
To get me soul, getting my everything
When I already gave it to her
No
Baby girl I left a piece of my heart
In New York, in L.A
Baby 'cause I left a piece of my heart
In Paris, in London

I've made love
Love around the world, love around the world
Love around the world
I've made love
Love around the world, love around the world
One too many girls

We're not touched down, take off at your seat
Checking the hotel, better be on you
We're like ooh ooh
She love me so
Get it up to me before I go
Girl I'm just letting you know

I've made love
Love around the world, love around the world
Love around the world
I've made love
Love around the world, love around the world
One too many girls

I can't expect to get my heart, to get my mind
To get me soul, getting my everything
When I already gave it to her
No
I can't expect to get my heart, to get my mind
To get me soul, getting my everything
When I already gave it to her
No
Baby girl I left a piece of my heart
In New York, in L.A
Baby 'cause I left a piece of my heart
In Paris, in London
I've made love
Love around the world, love around the world
Love around the world
I've made love
Love around the world, love around the world
One too many girls
