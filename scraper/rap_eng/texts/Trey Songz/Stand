[Verse 1]
See it's a couple ways that we can go about this
We can carry on or we can flip a new switch
We can't just put a damper on the fire
And never take the chance to let it rise up
Maybe 'cause we know it won't survive us
Afraid to let it burn

[Pre-Chorus]
We got one foot on "I love you"
The other one's on "it's over"
It's easier to just to lay down
But we may never break ground

[Chorus]
If we don't stand
For the future
For the new us
We'll be ruined
If we don't stand
For the future
For the new us
We'll be ruined

[Verse 2]
Tired of old traditions, I think it's time we made a change
Let's stay true to our religion, love's the only way
So don't you let them dim the light inside you
And never take the chance to let it rise up
Baby 'cause they know you're a survivor
But will they ever learn?

[Pre-Chorus]
We got one foot on "I love you"
The other one's on "it's over"
It's easier to just to lay down
But we may never break ground

[Chorus]
If we don't stand
For the future
For the new us
We will fail
If we don't stand
For the future
For the new us
We will fail

[Bridge]
Once we stand up we'll be one
Fighting together towards the strong
Knowing the battle's here at home
We can't afford to get it wrong

[Chorus: Variation]
So won't you stand
(Stand)
For the future
(For the future)
For the new us
(Stand)
For the children
(Stand)
