(verse1)
Look at what this girl done did to me
She done cut me off from her good, good love
She told me that those days was gone
(oh, oh, oh)

(chorus:)
Now im sittin here goin halfway crazy
(oh, oh, oh)
Cause i know she still thinks about me too
(oh, oh)
And it ain't no way in hell that i can be just friends with you
(you, you, you)
And i wish we never did it, and i wish we never loved it, and i wish i never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends

(verse2)
The way it felt, no faking it. maybe we were moving just a little too fast
But what we've done we can't take it back(back, back, back)

(chorus:)
Now im sitting here halfway crazy
(oh, oh)
Cause i know she still thinks about me too

(oh, oh)
And it ain't no way in hell that i can be just friends with you
(oh, oh)
And i wish we never did it, and i wish we never loved, and i wish i never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends

And all i can say is: (la 7x's) laaaa (la 9x's) la la la ohhh (la 7x's)
Hey, ain't no telling what we could've been (ain't no tellin what we could've been, no)

(bridge:)
And if i knew it ends like this
I never would've kissed you cause i fell in love with you
We never would've kicked it
Girl, every thing's different
I've lost my own recoverin' my friend
I wish we never did it
And i wish we never loved it
And i wish i never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends
(la 23x's)
(ain't no tellin when we can be friends)
