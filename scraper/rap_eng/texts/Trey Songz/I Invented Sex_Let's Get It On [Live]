I see you at the club ooh, shawty
Walkin' past a nigga lookin' all naughty
Then I said, "Baby wassup?"
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug
Bottles of H got me wit' a lil buzz
Up in VIP wit' all my thugs
You leaned over and said you want me
Girl, when the valley pull the Benz up
Off to the crib, where we gon' end up
Sit back, relax, hold up
Baby, won't you sing my song
Girl, let me get you to the crib
Upstairs to the bed
Girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think
When I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feeling, so long, yeah
And if you feel I got feel baby
Come on, oh, come on
Say what, what we gon' do?
Let's get it on, let's get it on
Let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
Stop beating' 'around the bush, oh
