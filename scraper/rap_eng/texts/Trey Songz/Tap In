Like tap in
Y'all need a break, I just walked up into church
Like tap in
She turned me down, so I pulled up with a purse
I'm back in
I'm blacking out, people hate me
'Cause I love my black skin
So now I'm clout, they don't matter
Went and got a black Benz
I know they high, so I'm spending money
With my black friends
Yeah, I'm the man now
And I was that nigga back then
Been around some vicious bitches
Plotting on my niggas' riches
Tell her give no give no time for chubbies
By the light she hitting switches
When your done you can hit the kitchen
When your done you can hit the dishes
When your done you can bring your friend
Come and grant your nigga wishes

[Bridge: Jag]

'Cause that shit pricey yeah
You ain't colder than ya boy

Couple drinks, it got me staring at your wifey, yeah

When you see us at the club
Know we 'bout to strap in
If you see me with the girl
Then I'm prolly tapping
Taking trips around the world, girl
We got to packing
Racist white folks love to say
They got some black friends
Lock a nigga up, Benny up
May-bachin'
What the fuck is up?
Uncut, get it cracking
JAG hit me up, pen that game
Like a MAC-10
I don't give no-no fucks
By my dolo, bruh
Henny in a Solo cup
I make it look easy, I be in DC

Momma said love no slut
No I don't love her, but
I know I love her butt
What if the rubber bust?
That's all fucked up

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
