[Intro]
Trigga babe

[Verse 1]
Wish I lost the keys to my Rover
Wish I lost the number to my chauffeur
But she begging me to come over
Even though I know I shouldn't go over
I'm on my way to her place
Am I ever gon' learn my lesson?
All these sins disguised as blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
Never felt we'd kiss and tell our private conversations
I know damn well I'll go through hell from falling for your temptations
She said let her go, she said let her go
So what I do better now?
She said pull it now, but don't pull it out
So what I do? Sweat it out

[Chorus]
Man, I'm too old for this shit, man, I'm too grown for this shit
If I want it, I'ma go get it, this is all too familiar
Man, I'm too old for this shit, man, I'm too grown for this shit
If I want it, I'ma go get it, I'm a serial killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer

[Verse 2]
Wish I wasn't on your wish list
Now I'm unwrapping you like Christmas
Wish I was a little stronger mentally
Then I wouldn't be so weak physically
Having my way below your waist
Am I ever gon' learn my lesson?
All these sins disguised as blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
Never felt we'd kiss and tell our private conversations
I know damn well I'll go through hell from falling for your temptations
She said let her go, she said let her go
So what I do better now?
She said pull it now, but don't pull it out
So what I do? Sweat it out

[Chorus]
Man, I'm too old for this shit, man, I'm too grown for this shit
If I want it, I'ma go get it, this is all too familiar
Man, I'm too old for this shit, man, I'm too grown for this shit
If I want it, I'ma go get it, I'm a serial killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer

[Bridge]
Swear it's so crazy that every night
I love a new woman up in my life
She's seen some dope shit that she's never seen
I give her dope then 'cause she's just a fiend
Woman I love, why don't you leave me?
It may be hard, but it's never easy
Girl, why you trust me, why you believe me?
You should say fuck me, girl you don't need me
I'm always on some other shit
Paying more attention to the one I'm going home with
Am I gon' change? I don't know if I'm strong enough to ever let it go
If you stick around 'til I'm out, no matter who it is, girl, I'll always know it

[Pre-Chorus]
Never felt we'd kiss and tell our private conversations
I know damn well I'll go through hell from falling for your temptations
She said let her go, she said let her go
So what I do better now?
She said pull it now, but don't pull it out
So what I do? Sweat it out

[Chorus]
Man, I'm too old for this shit, man, I'm too grown for this shit
If I want it, I'ma go get it, this is all too familiar
Man, I'm too old for this shit, man, I'm too grown for this shit
If I want it, I'ma go get it, I'm a serial killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer
