[Hook: Trey Songz]
Even though I'm in the streets
You know exactly what I do
And when I, chase this paper
You ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Because I ride, or die
Girl, we gon' get good

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Baby, just hold it down, I need a chick that'll ride for me
My gutter baby who ain't scared to put in time for me
See this the remix shawty, I'ma keep the cash comin'
Don't guess who played the track and fast to keep the cash runnin'
You my official lady, number one like McGrady
Don't do nobody favours, tell them fuck off and pay you
That's what I love about you, don't watch no soap operas
You back that paper half naked, get that coke and product
Then bring them dollars back to papa, give you half a profit
You can go blow the money, that Louis bag of hundreds
Niggas be tryna holler, but she be hella frontin'
She never met a nigga as real so it's all or nothin'

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Even though I'm in the streets
You know exactly what I do
And when I, chase this paper
You ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
Because I ride, or die
Girl, we gon' get good
And if you ride, or die
We gon' make it out this hood

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
She my Lamborghini, I'm her '57
When she hold me, I close my eyes and just picture Heaven
She picture perfect, this a perfect picture
I'm stuffin' thousand lines in each and every purse I get you
I kiss her in the mouth, she watch my money stack
She know I'm here forever, it's deeper than the rap
I have multiple shones, she one in a milli'
Now it's colorful stones 'cause there's ice in my Phillies

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Sorry, I got to go, I got to get it
But she know how daddy roll, I'm comin' back home with it
Sometimes I take her with me when I go and get my dough
'Cause my girl roll harder then some nigga I know
And I know, that she know, I'm by her side, she by my side
And if I ride, then she gon' to ride, and we gon' to ride until we die
Now now now now, picture us rollin', in somethin' stolen
Steerin' wheel twirlin', who? Me and my girlfriend

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Even though I'm in the streets

We gon' make it out this hood
