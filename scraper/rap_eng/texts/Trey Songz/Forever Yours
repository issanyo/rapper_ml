[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I bet her panties on the floor now, hey
I can see it going down, I'm ready now
And I don't wanna wait another minute, no
So I won't, girl, I'm gonna handle business, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope she's naked in the bed, bed, bed
I hope she tell me what she want just so I could do whatever she says
I hope she puts me to the test, what's next? Girl, I came prepared, yeah
Give it to her body real good, get up in her head, her head

[Chorus]
And no it ain't my crib, but I'm coming home
Daddy's little girl, I'ma treat you like you grown
Show you how I feel, ain't that what you want?
When I hit the door, all the clothes coming off
And once I hit, there ain't nothing better for sure
And once I'm in, you gon' say it's forever yours, it's forever yours
Tell me it's forever yours, forever yours
Yours, yours tell me it's forever yours, hey

[Verse 2]
Walking in the door now, hey
Candles burning all around, she's ready now
And there ain't no bounds, no limits, no
I'ma hold you so close when we finish

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl I hope, I hope she's naked in the bed, you are, you are
I hope she tell me what she want, just so I could do whatever she says, tell me baby
I hope she puts me to the test, what's next? Girl, I came prepared, yeah
Give it to her body real good, get up in her head, her head

[Chorus]
And no it ain't my crib, but I'm coming home
Daddy's little girl, I'ma treat you like you grown
Show you how I feel, ain't that what you want?
When I hit the door, all the clothes coming off
And once I hit, there ain't nothing better for sure
And once I'm in, you gon' say it's forever yours, it's forever yours
Tell me it's forever yours, forever yours
Yours, tell me it's forever yours

[Bridge]
I wanna do it real slow, if that's okay
I wanna take my time and make your day
Make your night turn into the morning
Forever yours
I wanna do it real slow, if that's okay
I wanna take my time and make your day
Make your night turn into the morning
From sunrise, down onto the evening
Change sheets six times and that's just for the weekend
Call me the plumber man from the way it be leaking
Gone so long, girl, I'm happy to be back
Yes, I'm in the zone, can't another nigga match
I hope she's naked in the bed
Promise I'ma do what these other niggas said
They would if they could

[Chorus]
And no it ain't my crib, but I'm coming home
Daddy's little girl, I'ma treat you like you grown
Show you how I feel, ain't that what you want?
When I hit the door, all the clothes coming off
And once I hit, there ain't nothing better for sure
And once I'm in, you gon' say it's forever yours, it's forever yours
Tell me it's forever yours, forever yours
Yours, tell me it's forever yours, hey
