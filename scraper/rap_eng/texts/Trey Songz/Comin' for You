[Verse 1]
On my way, oh oh oh
Oh yeah, comin' for you

[Verse 1]
My day done been so crazy and I know you been waiting
But baby girl, it won't be long 'cause soon I'm coming home
Oh the phone just started ringing and my boys think I been fighting
Next thing you know my mama called, talking 'bout her car done stalled
And I was almost there baby and the sky just got hazy
Then rain began to fall, then Grandma start going off
But I swear I'm coming baby, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting
You just keep holding on, sleet, hail or snow, I want you know to know

[Chorus]
I'm coming for you, baby
Get that love ready, hold steady, my lady
I'm coming for you
Get them hugs ready, hold steady, my lady
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you
Ain't nothing gonna hold me back, no baby

[Verse 2]
Now the PO's done pulled me over, but I swear girl I was sober
See they said I fit descriptions of a man that killed a witness
Ooh baby, this ain't fair 'cause I was almost there
So just keep holding on, sleet, hail or snow, I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm coming for you, I'm coming back, girl, I'm coming
Get that love ready, hold steady, my lady
Girl, I'm coming for you
Get them hugs ready, hold steady, my lady
I'm coming for you
I'm coming for you, yeah yeah yeah yeah
You better believe it, put that on everything

[Bridge]
Speeding hydroplaning, this rainy road
My baby need me so I gotta go
If loving was smoke, then my baby's dro
And I need a hit so yo, I gotta roll
And it don't matter what I gotta do
Get out my way 'cause see, I'm on the move
No need to wonder who I'm coming to
I'm coming for you

[Chorus]
I'm coming for you
Get that love ready, hold steady, my lady
I'm coming for you
Get them hugs ready, hold steady, my lady
Tryna told ya, I'm coming for you
Rain sleet hail or snow, I just need you know
That I'm coming for you, my lady
I'm coming for you
Get them hugs ready, hold steady, my lady
I'm coming for you
Get that love ready, hold steady, my lady
I'm coming for you
Put that on everything
Get them hugs ready, hold steady, my lady
