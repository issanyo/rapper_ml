Who let you down?
Who let you down?
If he ever took that opportunity to break your trust
I hate him, it's gon' come around
But I didn't hurt you, no

So why do we make it hella complicated?
Like a nigga guilty, all these accusations
Girl, I ain't no flagrant
See, I'm doin' the most
You really wanna chill, girl, you was my favorite

Who let you down? Yeah
When it comes to me, I don't wanna choose the game
I don't wanna cause you pain
I'm not tryna stay in your face
I'm tryna take away your pain
I see it in your eyes
Girl, who let you down? Yeah
Who let you down?
Who let you down?

When it comes to me, I don't wanna cause you pain
I don't wanna cause you pain
When it comes to me, I don't wanna cause you pain
Tryna take away your pain
I'm tryna take away your pain
Feel my love, uhh, uhh
Feel my love, uhh, uhh

[Verse]
Better than the drugs, better than the club
Better than what you had before
I understand you hate that boy
But I'm not that man who made them choices
Focus on the now, focus on me now
Let me lift you up, he lets it down
Girl, what goes around comes around, you know it's true
He left a broken you
Girl, let me help you get over dude
He got his comin', tell me who
Say you want my love but you don't know now
Say you want my love but you don't know how
I'll be fast, won't slow down
Don't wanna stay but you won't go now
Don't wanna stay but you won't go now
Don't wanna stay but you won't go now

Now, who let you down? Yeah
Who let you down?
If he ever took that opportunity to break your trust
I hate him, it's gon' come around
But I didn't hurt you, no
So why do we make it hella complicated?
Like a nigga guilty, all these accusations
Girl, I ain't no flagrant
See, I'm doin' the most
You really wanna chill, girl, you was my favorite

Who let you down? Yeah
When it comes to me, I don't wanna choose the game
I don't wanna cause you pain
I'm not tryna stay in your face
I'm tryna take away your pain
I see it in your eyes
Girl, who let you down? Yeah
