She, she, she, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
She, she, she, she just set the tempo
She, she, she, she never keep it simple
It's like we're never in the middle
I'm tryna figure out this riddle, ooh
It's these games, baby girl

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
These games we play
No wins, we're losers, yeah, yeah, yeah
You come, you stay
You run away
Tell me how you wanna move now, now
Nothing gon' change, baby
Yeah, nothing gon' change
It stays the same
Nothing's gonna change
The crazy little games we play

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I told you she was nobody, shit
She left her bag in the 'Rari, shit
I'm runnin' round with a thottie bitch
Shawty get down, she with all this shit
Don't even know what we call this shit
Shit that you say, you was over with
Go on my phone on your nosey shit
Hit you with "that's just the homie" shit
(That's just my homegirl, for real)
And I need you back on my lonely shit
Now you want me back on your lonely shit, yeah
Tell me you love it, baby
All this tugging, baby, these games we play

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
These games we play
No wins, we're losers, yeah, yeah, yeah
You come, you stay
You run away
Tell me how you wanna move now
Yeah, nothing gon' change, baby
Yeah, nothing gon' change
It stays the same
Nothing's gonna change
The crazy little games we play

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
She sick and tired of the sorry shit
She start a fight in the party, shit
So sick and tired of the arguing
Find you somebody to argue with
Don't even know what to call this shit
Do we even know what honest is?
Mend all the broken promises
Then we go back and love again
I miss my best friend
Please let me back in, yeah, yeah
She cry on my shoulder, I lay in her arms
Just like that, we back on
Games we play

[Chorus: MIKExANGEL & Trey Songz]
These games we play

No wins, we're losers, yeah, yeah, yeah
You come, you stay
You run away
Tell me how you wanna move now
'Cause nothing's gon' change
Yeah, nothing gon' change
Yeah, nothing gon' change, baby
It stays the same
Nothing's gonna change
The crazy little games we play
These games we play (these games we play)
No wins, we're losers, yeah, yeah, yeah
You come, you stay
You run away
Tell me how you wanna move now, girl
'Cause nothing's gon' change
Yeah, nothing gon' change
Yeah, nothing gon' change, baby
It stays the same
Nothing's gonna change
