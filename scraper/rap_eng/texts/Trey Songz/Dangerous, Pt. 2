[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous (dangerous, dangerous, dangerous)

[Verse 1: Sam Martin]
You, you take me down, spin me around
You got me running all the lights
Don't make a sound, talk to me now
Let me inside your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Martin]
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar, ooh
But I just got that feeling, sugar, ooh
And I can hear the sirens burning, red lights turning
I can't turn back now, so hold on tight

[Chorus: Sam Martin & Trey Songz]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh oh oh oh oh
D-dan-d-dangerous
Oh oh oh oh oh
Dangerous

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Show me your soul, I gotta know
Bet that you're beautiful inside
Toes on the gas, car moving fast
Come take the wheel and drive

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't know what you're thinking, sugar, oh, oh, oh, yeah
And I just got that feeling, sugar, oh, oh, oh, yeah
I can hear the sirens burning, red lights turning
I can't turn back now, so hold on tight

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh oh oh oh oh
D-dan-d-dangerous
Oh oh oh oh oh
D-d-dan-d-dangerous

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Dan-d-dangerous (Trigga)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, baby, never scared, baby (yeah)
Running all the red lights, living on the edge, baby (woo!)
Just a little crazy, maybe we are (yeah!)
Doing 'bout 100 and she want in the car (uh-huh)
And I don't know what you did, don't know what it is (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Can't explain it now, it's dangerous

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
It's dangerous, so dangerous (dangerous, oh)
I wanna do it again (I wanna do it again)
It's dangerous, so dangerous (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I wanna do it again
Dangerous, so dangerous (yeah, oh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious, oh, woah
Oh oh oh oh oh
D-dan-d-dangerous, d-dan-d-dangerous
Oh oh oh oh oh, woo!
D-d-dan-d-dangerous

[Outro: Trey Songz]
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, woah, d-dan-d-dangerous
