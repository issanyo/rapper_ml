[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When you decide to break the rules

[Refrain: Kanye West]
'Cause I just heard some real bad news

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
People'll talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you how long have you known dude
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When you decide, to break the rules

[Refrain: Kanye West]
'Cause I just heard some real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Oh, you just gon' keep another no you won't
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
Oh, you just gon' keep another love for you
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
While I'm waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Oh, you just gon' keep it like you never knew
My face turned to stone when I heard the news

[Outro: Kanye West]
What's on the news?
Channel cruise

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Uh, Okay, the news just came in
That Tremaine is, now Grammy nominated
Aw man what a dream, but what'a nigga think
Ain't shit changed but the color of the leaves
Still I'ma go hard, like the dick in da broad
If you hate that, you can put my dick in yo jaws
And don't waste that, I will never lose
Cause the lord where my faith at, uh, take that
I've endured more pain from the game
More strain on the brain than I thought I could sustain
Granddaddy just died, that's gon' bring my daddy close to me
We gon' ride out, and chop it up, that's how it's supposed to be
Life too short for me to worry about your thoughts
God judge me, I give a fuck about the court
Plus y'all all foul like Shaq was on the court
Don't talk shit now, if you ain't back it up before
But y'all can't stop me from reaching my goals
You gay behind doors looking through a peep hole
Tired as a nnnn, I don't never sleep though
Play the game to win, I'll never cheat though
Sometimes it seems I will never beat though
Still how you earn a blow like, C4
Naw nigga can take me take me, no Repo
Naw nigga can face me, no equal
Fire under me, Teeth over lip
Underdog shit like I'm under my pits
Photograph me in a picture like a pimp
The women love me like hate doesn't exist
Suicide songs I slit my wrists
Suicide doors on the whip ain't shit
Do as I can, true as I am
Old niggas can never be as new as I am
I ain't sayin' the same man, life about evolving
Many other dogs who haven't grown, they're just disolvin'
Such a misfortune, triggers such a problem
Ain't no mathamatics to equate him or to solve him
Word is I'm cold, and they just wanna defrost him
Words in my [?] turn to songs, turn to awesome
Mind on float, body on coast, which one pick one
I'll probably finna' touch down
Just bought a seven I ain't finna' touch down
Thoughts running like a man trying to get his gut down
Daydreaming of my aborted daughters
Trying to put my best foot forward and balance
Like a skater would, searching for a greater good
Ridin' through my old neighborhood
Outer door wreaths, it was Christmas time
40 chrome piece with a clip inside
Out of yo reach, Salvatore feet
I adore beats, then I kill'em so sweet
Sick of niggas hatin', quit deliberatin'
It's anti-climatic how your antics are average
I'm on acid, you got it all backwards
Trey Songz sing, but Tremaine has all assets
Bastards, bastards
