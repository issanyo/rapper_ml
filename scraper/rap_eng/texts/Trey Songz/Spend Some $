[Hook: Trey Songz & Chingy]
Spend some money on ya, a little money on ya
Drop some money on ya, a little money
Spend some money on ya, a little money on ya

So whatchu want girl?

A little money

[Verse 1: Chingy]
You a material girl, in a material world
A celebrity chick, that want diamonds and pearls
Naw, I don't mind doin' for you in public
You let me touch it and rub it, but I don't love you
I let her drive the whip, stay over
Call her girlfriends to my house and let 'em lay over
Take her where she want, when she want
But don't get it twisted, the girl no her do's and don'ts
My mama likes her, pops dig her
Damn near took eight months just to hit her
When we go out, we take pictures
She bad, lil dirty, around my homies, I kiss her
And ya'll know that ain't me, fo' sho' that ain't me
Oh, it's 'bout dough, and that's me
My ride or die girl goin' hard
I spend it on her since the cash flow flowin' hard

[Hook: Trey Songz & Chingy]
Spend some money on ya, a little money on ya

So whatchu want girl?
What's mine's is yours
So whatchu want girl?

[Verse 2: Chingy]
I take her on trips, she like to go to Italy
Get it, heel game, that girl be killin' me
I love her attitude, feisty and silly, B
Sex never bad, she the drug that be healin' me
Sometimes though, the broad get the illest E
Notice that another chick, feelin' me
Hey now, said she want a 'lac truck
She don't like ridin' low 'cause she like to sit up
Put the 26's on it, what the fuck
Gave it to her, told her, tear the streets up
Pretty girl, but she keep the heat tucked
She tough, see bruh but she a freak, she enough, ya dig

[Verse 3: Chingy]
Figures, girls look so good
But their brains are not ready, I don't know
I'd rather get with a baller chick
Doin' it real heavy, and gettin' dough
I'm a fly guy, baby, you got be up to part
Hair, nails done, feet, lookin' like a star
Everywhere we go, they need to know who we are
And It's a must that we hop out the nicest cars
