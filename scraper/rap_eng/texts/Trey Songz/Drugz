[Chorus]
Yeah, tonight I need your body

Not tonight, not tonight

[Verse 1]
Ride the wave, ride the wave like a wave runner
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid of me
She like whips, she like chains, she a slave for me
Got my hands between her legs like she breathe for me
Bring a friend, get it in while she wait for me
That's okay, she gon' come so she stay for me
That's okay, she gon' come, she gon' stay for me
Go to work every time that she play it for me
Keep these lame hoes so, so far away from me
Pussycat please never throw it straight for me

[Chorus]
Yeah, tonight I need your body
Yeah, oh, yeah
Tonight, you won't be sorry
Not tonight, not tonight
Tonight I need your body
You got all my time, ohh
Tonight, you got my time
Only you tonight, I do you right, I do you right
Tonight, I need you baby
Tonight, I need you body, body, baby
Tonight, you got my time
You got all my time, you got, you got mine
Tonight
Tonight, I need your body
You do somethin' that the drugs can't do
Tonight, I need your body
You do somethin' that the drugs can't do
You do somethin' that the drugs can't do
You do somethin' that the drugs can't do

[Verse 2]
Give me love, give me love 'cause I need some, yeah
Run it back, make it dub like a re-run, yeah
Know you're lookin' for some fun, we could have some, yeah
Bubbles all in the tub like I'm Rev Run, yeah
Bless a nigga, oh my God, like the reverend, yeah
Fuck it up and see if I could get your ass done, yeah
My heart gettin' colder, is there a spare one there?
My heart gettin' colder, is there a spare one there?

[Chorus]
Yeah, tonight I need your body
Tonight, I need your body, baby
Tonight, you won't be sorry
Not tonight, not tonight, not tonight
Tonight I need you body
You got all my time, ohh
Tonight, you got my time
Only you tonight, I do you right, I do you right
Tonight, I need you baby
Tonight, I need you body, body, baby

You do somethin' that the drugs can't do
Tonight I need your body
You do somethin' that the drugs can't do
