You know I have to be honest it's like
For the first time in my life
My pride is not involved
And I'm not afraid
Not afraid to tell you girl that
Girl I love you believe dat!
If I can't have you I don't know what I'm a do
Listen to me

That's why I really wanna tell you somethin'
I really think this is it for me
I really think your the one I need
Cause baby I done had them all nope
I don't want nobody but you (uh) no darling
Honey let me break it down
See we living in a lonely world
Ain't cha tired of the runnin' round
Don't you wanna be my only girl
Baby can I be the one you call
When you tired of the lies
And the truth is all you wanna hear
Well if you swear
Baby here I am! (here I am
I'm yo man (I'm yo man)
I came with everything you needed
You and me are undefeated until the end of time
One mind, one heart, one love
All you gotta do is take
My hand (take my hand)
We will stand (we will stand)
This was made to last forever
So let's say it together
For the rest of time
One mind, one heart, one love (oh listen baby oh)
I'll give you all I'm worth from my head down to my shoes
And girl if we gone work then I need the same from you
I know that so many other dudes cheat but so many dudes ain't me

And I'll pick you girl every time
I just wanna break it down
See we living in a lonely world girl
Ain't cha tired of the runnin' round
