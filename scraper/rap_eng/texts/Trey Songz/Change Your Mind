[Intro]
Pretty pretty girls, all around the world
Pretty pretty girls, all around the world

[Verse 1]
I know that what you heard ain’t fair
'Cause people gon' say shit, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
No different from all of these women
But do you believe it? Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain’t by chance that we’re here
Only got one life to live so
Let me change your mind

[Chorus]
They saying I’m bad for you, that’s fine
Sometimes bad is a good time
Don’t you be shy
Let me change your mind
Can’t never have a one night only
But you don’t need to be lonely
Come get to know me
Let me change your mind
Your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
Your mind, your mind
Let me change your mind
Your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
Your mind, your mind
Let me change your mind

[Verse 2]
I feel you, but it won’t kill you
To let me get near you, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Your lips miss need my kisses
So baby stop tripping, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain’t by chance that we’re here
Only got one life to live so
Let me change your mind

[Chorus]
They saying I’m bad for you, that’s fine
Sometimes bad is a good time
Don’t you be shy
Let me change your mind
Can’t never have a one night only
But you don’t need to be lonely
Come get to know me
Let me change your mind
Your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
Your mind, your mind
Let me change your mind
Your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
Your mind, your mind
Let me change your mind

[Bridge]
Pretty pretty girls all around the world
I just wanna take my time
Pretty pretty girls all around the world
I just wanna change your mind
Pretty pretty girls all around the world
I just wanna take my time
Pretty pretty girls maybe you could
Let me change your mind

[Chorus]
They saying I’m bad for you, that’s fine
Sometimes bad is a good time
Don’t you be shy
Let me change your mind
Can’t never have a one night only
But you don’t need to be lonely
Come get to know me
Let me change your mind
Your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
Your mind, your mind
Let me change your mind
Your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
Your mind, your mind
Let me change your mind

[Outro]
Pretty pretty girls, all around the world
Pretty pretty girls
Maybe you could
Let me change your mind
