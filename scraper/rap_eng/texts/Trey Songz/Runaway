Ooooooh oh ooooh
Wooooah ooh oooooo

For the longest time, I’ve been wantin' my shine, I’m Songz
And I will never let up I’ve been wanting this way too long
Got me sitting so high, trying to balance out the lows
And I think it’s time that I propose a toast

Let’s make a toast to the dickheads that boast ’cause we get bread
Toast to the bad bitches that shit on the ass bitches
Everybody think they’re Jordan so toast to the Pippen’s
Nobody’s the same but we know different
We all want this money right
Everybody trying to eat like it’s money pie
I should live 100 lives I should have 100 wives
In a hundred beds, I should tell her 100 lies
Then I wonder why, when it’s all set and done
Tell me what will I become
I wanna say that I did learn some, earn some
Bad memories I done burn some
Sanitize my hands and now the germs gone
See you niggas is disgusting
Bad bitches worldwide wanna fuck em
You see they treat my dick like lip balm
They know I hit hard, no concussion, come on

[Hook]

Let’s make a toast to the cool tags
Let’s have a toast for the cash flow
Make a toast to a new bag
On the arm of a bad ho
Make a toast to the bad days
So we appreciate the sun rays

If you still don’t understand , stay away as far as you can
Stay away, stay away, stay away as far as you can X 3
Still don’t understand
Stay away as far as you can

This girl I barely even know, scream loud for me
Whore hey no one get to lie of me
See I’m living life with no boundaries
But even a sunny day got clouds you see
I’m floating in the air, I live there
Laid back chair, call me song Air
I got a beautiful beach, you got a beach chair
I’m the big picture and you’re just a small square
But who am I to say I’m better man
I just want this shit forever man
Momma said there will be better days
But when better days came
I knew there were better thangs
I hated me, you telling me this everything
Now quit playing man where’s everything?
The women are amazing, the liquors always tasteful
The party off the chain
But emptiness remains, tell me where’s the love that I’m missing?
From every day kitchen, or a girl thats really down cause I know she’s been around
I feel like something wrong, but everything’s right
Hand quotes in the air read left right
I ain’t trying to bitch I’m living a blessed life
Would I trade it in motherf-cker? Yeah, right
Wack n-ggers can’t hear me nor see me
This is the graveyard, death sight

[Hook]

Let’s make a toast to the good times
Let’s have a toast for the cash flow
Make a toast to a new thang
On the arm of a bad ho
Make a toast to the bad day
So we appreciate the sun rise

You still don’t understand , stay away as far as you could
Stay away, stay away, stay away as far as you could X 3
Still don’t understand
Stay away as far as you can

If I could stand on a cloud and speak out loud to the world below me
Proclaim my name just so that they know me, you see the neighbors know my name
Even the haters love my fame, everybody plays my game
We’ve got mental hypocrisy at such high velocities
When I speak truth, everybody calls me Socrates
I’ve got such a philosophy that everybody’s watching me
Looking at they wrist, shit everybody’s clocking me
Ahhh, there’s no thrill like a slow kill
Standing at the bottom looking at the top
Hoping that they stop blocking me
If I had a day job n-ggers probably stay docking me
See I hate rules, if you said I obey, you ain’t ever know Trey
You ain’t know I’m seasoned like obey
Do re mi so fa la ti do, toast it to the assholes, exclude me through
Please, don’t involve me in that, see I’m a dignified man with a signified plan
And all problems he'll solve them just leave them into his hands
