[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Tryna show 'em it's my time
Building mansions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye
You ask me why
(Yeah, ha) Wh—y—y—y?
I'm building castles in the sky
I'm building castles in the sky

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I used to ride around town in a whatcha call it
Looking like a demo rapper, feeling like a dusty wallet
Getting fired, then hired, then re-fired
The Idiot's Guide to how to build an empire
I show you how to stunt, show you how to pop
Got a watch for my wrist and a watch for my Pops
Ballin' from the baseline, bottom to the top
Got bullets on speed-dial, yeah, I call shots
Now you can't act like you never heard of me
'Cause I'm so third degree everyday I'm burning leaves
I'm in my castle and I'm never coming down
They always said I had my head in the clouds
Ha!

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Tryna show 'em it's my time
Building mansions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye ... goodbye..
Why...
I'm building castles in the sky
Haa, haa, haa
Haa, haa, haa
Haa, haa, haa, haa
I'm building castles in the sky

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I use to fantasize about the baddest girl I couldn't get with
Couldn't get her number, couldn't even get a digit
Then I saw the light, now my nights are quite explicit
I be lost inside the ganja, would’ve sworn I went missing
Got bills paid
Got the whole hood saying, "Damn, Bobby Ray done came a mighty long way"
No GPS, OnStar or navigation
We some self made niggas, shout out to my operation
It started in my mind then it started taking shape
I still cannot believe that these events are taking place
I'm in my castle and I'm never coming down
It's no wonder why my head is in the clouds
Ha!

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Tryna show 'em it's my time
Building mansions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye
Why...
I'm building castles in the sky
Haa, haa, haa
Haa, haa, haa
Haa, haa, haa, haa
I'm building castles in the sky

[Bridge: B.o.B]
Building castles the size of colosseums
Thirty thousand feet up, I swear you gotta see 'em
Cruising altitude with a foolish attitude
Headed for the moon, maybe Mars, maybe Venus
Building castles the size of collesiums
Thirty thousand feet up, I swear you gotta see 'em
Cruising altitude with a foolish attitude
Headed for the moon maybe Mars, maybe Venus

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Tryna show 'em it's my time
Building mansions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye... goodbye
Why...
I'm building castles in the sky
Haa, haa, haa..
Haa, haa, haa..
Haa, haa, haa, haa..
I'm building castles in the sky

[Bridge: B.o.B]
Building castles the size of colosseums
Thirty thousand feet up, I swear you gotta see 'em
Cruising altitude with a foolish attitude
Headed for the moon, maybe Mars, maybe Venus
