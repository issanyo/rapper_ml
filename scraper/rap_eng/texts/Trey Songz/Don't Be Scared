[Intro: Trey Songz & Rick Ross]
Don't you be scared, boss
Don't you be scared
Don't you be, don't you be
Don't you be scared

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Body like she jumped off the page
Eye candy of the year
Plus you got a beautiful face
Let's go somewhere and disappear
Said she like to smoke, I do too
Said she like to drink, I do too
So what you think, have a long conversation?
What's on your mind? Tell me what you been thinking

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
I'ma keep it real a lot of women in my phone
But I'ma be for real you the only one I want
I ain't telling lies like I'm tryna settle down
You probably heard I get around

[Hook: Trey Songz]
But don't you be scared, girl, don't you be scared of a nigga
No matter what they say 'bout a nigga
Don't you be scared, don't matter what's your home girl opinion
You grown make your own damn decisions
Girl, don't you be, don't you be, don't you be, don't you be
Girl, don't you be, don't you be, don't you be, don't you be
Don't you be scared
Girl, don't you be scared of a nigga
No matter what they say 'bout a nigga
Don't be scared

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I ain't gon' bite ya
Unless it's something that you like, girl, you know that
Don't be scared
I just wanna get a little time, I ain't talking 'bout no watch
Can't call you no dime 'cause I know you can't be bought
I know you know you fine, I know you sick and tired
All these niggas lying talking about what they got

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
I'ma keep it real a lot of women in my phone
But I'ma be for real you the only one I want
I ain't telling lies like I'm tryna settle down
You probably heard I get around

[Hook: Trey Songz]
But don't you be scared, girl, don't you be scared of a nigga
No matter what they say 'bout a nigga
Don't you be scared, don't matter what's your home girl opinion
You grown make your own damn decisions
Girl, don't you be, don't you be, don't you be, don't you be
Girl, don't you be, don't you be, don't you be, don't you be
Don't you be scared
Girl, don't you be scared of a nigga
No matter what they say 'bout a nigga
Don't be scared

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Presidential suites and these foul blows
Livin' up and LIV, doin' what you do
Hangin' on and each of every moves
Detectives on my trail but don't have a clue
All I want is bad bitches, Mercedes Benz and millions
That's on the average
I'm ballin' with my lil homies, we smokin' lavish
Versace shirts, I remember we didn't have this
How I look now, all gold spinners, denim swarmin' foes
Stackin' money taller than my shawty low
I'm droppin' classes people nothin' shard go and go
Don't you be scared of me, baby 'cause all I do is ball

[Hook: Trey Songz]
But don't you be scared, girl, don't you be scared of a nigga
No matter what they say 'bout a nigga
Don't you be scared, don't matter what's your home girl opinion
You grown make your own damn decisions
Girl don't you be, don't you be, don't you be, don't you be
Girl, don't you be, don't you be, don't you be, don't you be
Don't you be scared
Girl don't you be scared of a nigga
No matter what they say 'bout a nigga
Don't be scared
No matter what they say 'bout a nigga
Don't be scared
