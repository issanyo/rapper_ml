[Intro: Trey Songz]
Yeah

Hella fun in this motherfucker right quick

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Baby wanna ride with the surfer
Baby like the white Coca-Cola
I'm way too high to be sober
So please don't cry on my shoulder

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Pop it, shit, pop it, shit
You too loud, I'm too lit
Water all on my wrist
You don't understand this drip
Bet you can't do it like this
Bet you can't do it like this (Ooh)
Bet you can't do it like this (No)
Bet you can't do it like this (Shit)
Water all on my wrist (Drip)
I done came through and got rich (Bullshit)

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Rich The Kid]
I'm way too high to be sober
So please don't cry on my shoulder (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Please don't cry on my shoulder
Way too high to be sober
Please don't cry on my shoulder
Please don't cry, please don't cry (Ay, ay, ooh)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid & Trey Songz]
Girl, you trippin', please baby, don't cry (Please baby, don't cry, please baby, don't cry)
That pussy mine, please baby, don't lie (Please baby, don't lie)
I'm a real pimp (Real Pimp)
Lean on a nigga like like rocket chip (What? what?)
I done blowed up, now, I'm outta here
Woah, baby, don't whine (Baby, don't whine)
Please baby, don't whine, whine, whine
Ayy, don't waste my time (Don't waste my time)
Don't waste my time, don't waste my time
I know you fine, ooh (I know you fine)
One of a kind, I might pull up (I might pull up) skrt
Then I drop the top (Skrt)
I might pull up (I might pull up) skrt
Then, buy you a drop
Wipe your tears (Wipe your tears)
Ain't no fear (Ain't no fear)

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Please don't cry on my shoulder
Way too high to be sober
Please don't cry on my shoulder
Please don't cry, please, please don't cry

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Keep my baby with me like a stroller
Know she got that wet, super soaker
Knock it out the park, call me Sosa
Get them pussy walls reupholstered
Wake up with the strap like it's Folgers
Heat by my side, Eric Spoelstra
Super sport the ride in the motor
You can never show her what I showed her, yeah, yeah
Young nigga rich, dripping boulders
Ears, mouth, neck and wrist, dripping boulders
Cold, I can feel my heart gettin' colder

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
So, please don't cry on my shoulder

[Verse 4: Trey Songz]
Let's whip out the Rolls, let's call up some hoes, ain't it dope
Now she fell in love, when she found I got the antidote
Partner sellin' dope, got that boy, he got that girl
I'm like baby girl, eat this dick just like a churro
Ooh, we ball, alcohol, fives every night
If you fine, you can skip the line anytime
Blow a bag, pop a tag, blow a bag, pop a tag
Way she call me daddy, I wonder if her papa mad

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Please don't cry on my shoulder
Way too high to be sober
Please don't cry on my shoulder
Please don't cry on my shoulder
Please don't cry on my shoulder
Please don't cry
Please don't cry on my shoulder
Please don't cry, please, please don't cry
