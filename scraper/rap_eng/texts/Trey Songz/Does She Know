She my distant lover, so far away
Dream of her, since that day
Distant lover, so far away
I wish that I could bring her here to me
Distant lover, so far away
Girl you so far away, hey

My distant lover, distant lover, hey
My distant lover, distant lover, hey
Girl you so far away, you so far away, you so far away
My distant lover, distant lover
I wish that I could bring her here to me

[Verse 1:]
Does she know, what she did
Turned my heart in flames
On that one time that she looked my way

Does she know, that sexy walk
Is still on my brain, when I think that I can't, I can't, I can't

[Hook:]
I can't take no more, I wanna be loving you
I've been in love with you
Since the day you came and you turned away
You never leave my brain
Noooo
I can't take no more
I wanna be loving you
I've been in love with you
Since the day you came and you turned away
You never leave my brain
Noooo

(This night I can't get you off my brain, And I don't want to)
Nooo

[Verse 2:]
Does she know, what she did
I walk around smelling her scent, wanting her lips
And every time I lay down, go to sleep
It is you that I see
Wish you'd come to me
Cause you still on my brain
No, I just can't, I just can't

[Hook]

Never leave, no
My distant lover, my distant lover
(babe you so far away, you so far away)
I wish that I could bring you here to me

I can't take no more, I wanna be loving you
(I wish that I could bring you here to me
Distant lover, distant lover)
You never leave my brain

I can't take no more
I wanna be loving you
I've been in love with you
My distant lover
I wish that I could bring you here to me
