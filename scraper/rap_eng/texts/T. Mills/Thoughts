Took a break for awhile had to grow on my own
And I don't really feel like talkin so just leave me alone
In your life you won't believe how many times they say no, but if you believe any of em then you may as well go
Know your worth, cause then you know what you deserve and if you know what you deserve then go and get it this i've learned
Cause you only got one life, you only got one life
And if you only got one life then fuck the limits you should pass em
People judge other people before they even get to know them, so fuck
Born into negativity, this sucks
And then as you grow up, they just say find your way and good luck
But, it doesn't have to be that way
Different people, different maze
I'm trying to live my dream with my eyes open not just when i lay down
I'm always trying to learn and grow
And so and so it goes
And the world can relate to not having a place (place place place place) so were far from being alone (lone lone lone lone) x2

Now raise your hand and without shame (shame shame shame shame) cause from where i stand we all seem the same (same same same same)
So now raise your hand and without shame (shame shame shame shame) cause from where i stand we all feel the same (same same same same)
