Midnight..

Verse 1 (T):
I'd be suffering in silence (yeah)
God knows life ain't giving no second chance (yeah)
World knocked me down but came back to fight
Sometimes I close my eyes & hope to see the light
Haters see me moving up they try dragging me down
Bang bang, here goes the sound (skirt)
Driving in the city with no location
All the niggas want all my attention
I know it's getting tight with all that tension
But fuck it imma skip the situation
MTL the city, TYG the movement han.. (han)
They say they the best
I say I'm from the west
They say they the hottest
I say you the lamest
They know they can't beat the case (ouh)
Cuz imma put a bullet through his face
Sike, I ain't about that life nigga
But trust me in my country nigga
I would end your life nigga (True)
What I hate is people thinking bigger than they are
It's that kind of people that will never go far
Still having respect for those who still pursue their dreams
Some of them though, end up in the streets eating beans (han)
And I know this does not look like it seems (oh, no)
My bitch bad & boujee but she ain't loyal imma fuck her bestie
They say we fuck boys but they the ones always busy
They ain't ready for nothing & the name T (T)

Hook 1 (YP):
I'm doing this shit for my brothers (my brothers)
I'm doing this shit for my city (my city)
Working hard every day (every day)
Imma stay up till Midnight (midnight)

Verse 2 (T):
I saw her & said damn girl you slay (you slay)
Fucking her at midnight but she ain't bae (nah)
They always use to say it's a brand new day
But I tell the haters get out the fucking way (fucking way)
She always tells me it's gonna be okay (okay)
Life didn't came up easy
But I know I got the money
I got my brother YP (YP)
Me & bitch we go crazy
And we're gonna do it till Midnight
Cuz we got it on first sight (yeah)
We we're born to be real not perfect
She tells me my chat game is on deck
But we came a long way from now on
We gon' keep fucking till the fucking dawn
They know stuff but might keep my shit low-key
From now on..

Hook 2 (YP):
I'm doing this shit for my brothers (my brothers)
I'm doing this shit for my city (my city)
Working hard every day (every day)
Imma stay up till Midnight (midnight)
