[Sample]
(Ohhhh hah huh, devil, you just got your butt kicked
My Lord if faithful, and my Lord is powerful
And my Lord is in charge
You can't fire him and he'll never retire
Thank you Jesus, glory hallelujah
Thank you Jesus, glory hallelujah)

[Verse : Cyril307]

See, tommorow I hope 'you stay strong'
That's what uncle Sam said
But he never showed to see the sun shine on my face
A blessing in disguise
Cause somehow, yeah I needed that space
Moved to the 5th and felt safe
Momma so sick, we say grace
Woke up one morning recalling
Tears drowning my eyes
Hoping that it's all in my mind
It's tomorrow but I haven't forgotten what yesterday done
You see it all when you lonely calling on heaven to come
I spread my heart through these stories
Knowing I'm destined to shine
Cause everything has it's time
Spread my wings and imagine
And teach myself how to fly
Cause everything was imagined before, yeah, it came about
See the light that's inside
I must've figured it out
What it takes to get out the city and cop me a house
Man this life is so far from pretty
I pray for those walking with me
Stand tall, never fall or give in
Get lost in the crowd
Tryna prove to people
That you fit enough for the crown
Oh yeah I been there
Repping the city
Know Imma kill it before I give back
Bag me a mil
Fuck all your feelings
This for the 5th man
Show all the children how you can go with just a dream, damn
Blind to all the teachers' preaches
While the preachers couldn't reach him

Thinking he a waste of semen something that's in him
Thinking he a waste of semen something that's in him
(Thinking he a waste of semen something that's in him)
(Thinking he a waste of semen something that's in him)
