[Slim Kid3]
I guess everybody needs somebody to love you can't
Leave love lonely cause being naive to it you can just
Lose it like that See kisses for bruises don't make it
Heal back it be's the sex appeal that's from the next
And not necessarily the sex and one might appeal to
The intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulation breaking down their shields for the real and
As it stands mysteriously curiosity it kills the cat and
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in behind
These fantasies with no action searching for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type
Of chemistry that flairs when her desires on fire quick
Is the fuse another loves for hire

[Chorus: x2]
And she said
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

[Fatlip]
I was high like the vocal tone of my nigga Bootie Brown
Decided to take a ride to see what's really goin' down up on
The northside of town Of course I bought a quarter pound
Of bomb hemp feelin' a-ight like Johnny Kemp on a Friday
Night Lookin' right cause my shit is tight blazin' blunts to city
Lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights Bounce to the House
Of Blues then I slid in free wit tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans
And no ID. Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the
Fizace of an epp wit an izass more amazin' than grace So
I waste no time to kick my little I say "How ya doin'" she say
"I'm doin' fine" so I commence to macking to baby to see
What's cracking So maybe I get her back at the cabin and
Start attacking Threw back a shot of yack and started jabber
And jibben Fibbing and adibin just to get her to my crib then
We was chilling on the bed bumping some Isley thought I was
About to spread the thighs but she surprised me when she
Said "oh like that? You know I don't get down" I know my
Homies gonna clown cause I let her stick around when

She said
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

[T. Hardson]
Now Daddy's home
But she's been waiting all night so we could be all alone
This is an everyday thing so we hang out by the phone
Trying to build something real
Working tips to the bone
So much loves gone astray that it won't be coming home
No time soon
So I dance with the silhouette beneath the moon
And she said if satisfactions guaranteed
Nothing else could come between
The flight of a new love babe, yeah maybe
We could be cool instead of sharin' this here ship
With the fools, you know get down to the bone (that)
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, baby
Right now, right now
Right now, baby, and she said
I'll give you the world if you want it
I'll give you the world if you need it baby
If you got to have it
And she said, you know that she said
And she said, and she said
And she said, and she said
And she said, yea
I'll give you the world if you want it
I'll give you the world if you need it baby
I'll give you the world if you want it
