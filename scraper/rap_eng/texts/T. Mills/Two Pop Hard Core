[ verse 1- Lil X ]

I know how to two pop hardcore
You want to know how to two pop hardcore
Whole time I did it
You weren't paying attention
But you don't want to mention
Yeah want to get pass
Got to do it hard core
You feeling kinda sore


[ verse 2-T$ ]

I came to do it hard core
On the dance floor
Your style is poor
Your not hard core
You weren't paying attention
But you don't want to mention
Yeah you want to get pass

[ Verse 3- Lil X ]

Rich off the Two pop
Killing you with it
Now I am feeling it
Hardcore forever
