Chorus (The Last Rhyme)

Everybody pulling me back
Ain't nobody holding me down
I can feel your face on my lap
So I put my feet on the ground

So rain let the pour, until the sun goes down
So can you feel my storm, I'm drowning in your world

Verse 1 (The Last Rhyme)

Yeah
You got me chasing dreams, filling the blank pages as I walk up on these streets
I see your light blinding, thou we on some different skemes
Collecting as you go, I'm giving as I leave

Hate it or love it, debate, I know I keep you waiting
Lucy in red, a page, I'm scripting essays of my life, re phrased the same
Nobody understands the truth cause I'm living the proof on the shit that you got to do
To make it to the top ain't no hand outs given ,I be scathing and clawing till I make through

A point in your life where you gotta choose, almost famous with a hard a excuse
We just gotta do what we gotta do
Yeah we gotta do what we gotta do
So I'm gon choose, I made my move, then everything just changed
Now every mother fucker here knows my name

Chorus (The Last Rhyme)

Verse 2 (Fenix)

You got me chasing dreams
Filling the blank pages as I walk up on the scene
I see the crowds cheering
I feel my family screaming
Flames of hell I fell now I'm tryna rise out thy ashes of hell
I told myself I can do this but you out here killing yourself
So I'm proving what I'm tryna prove and I'm doing what I'm tryna do
Ain't gonna loose I'ma kill the tune and see the devil the next full moon
Contracts handing me a silver spoon
But I'd rather loose
So let the struggle rain down
Until my eyes wide shut
Can you feel my pain
My lifes flashing ain't no thoughts in my brain
Life just took the blood out my veins
Got me standing in the rain
So before you judge me get to know me

Verse 3 (The Last Rhyme)

Everybody pulling me back
But I gotta break free and go get that
Ain't nobody holding me down
But I gotta get back up in this game man
I can feel your face on my lap
Now everything just seems so bad
So I put my feet on the ground
Lucy baby don't be that mad
So let the rain pour
But i'm hoping the flood don't fricken last
Until the sun goes down
Don't let darkness cover these lands
So can you feel my storm
Anarchy that be the plan
I'm drowning in your world
I'm drowning, I'm drowning
