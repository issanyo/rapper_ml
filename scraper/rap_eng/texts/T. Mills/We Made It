[Intro: Drey]
Ugh, T and young Drey. Ugh, let's get it. Ugh!

[Hook: Drey]
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz!

[Verse 1: Drey]
I do it for the team
My squad got shooters but ain't shooting for a ring
Like Lebron, you better call me "King"
If a nigga fuck with me then I'll hit him with that thing
And that's it, the end of the story was tragic
His funeral closed casket cause he got his wig split
Check him off my hit list
My niggas shoot like we can't miss
You just hit the rim like you can't piss
I'm a shark in a fish tank, bitch
YNS, Young & Savage shit
Make you disappear like a magic trick
Now your mama all sad and shit
Fuck a whip, I got a spaceship bitch
YNS, we let them K's rip
YNS, screaming "fuck that nigga Vic"
YNS, we fitting to make it
Fuck with YNS and get your life taken
Damn

[Hook: T]
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz!

[Verse 2: T]
We copping these 'rarris
We getting this money, we trapping all night
We killing these bitches, we dropping these hoes
We killing the game and we catching these flights
[?] said that we going all in
Odd Future Wolf Gang, they going all in
Killing these rappers, yeah, guess that's a sin
Stomp on his face and then wipe off the Timbs
We on adventures like we Jake and Finn
Y'all taking L's cause my niggas, we win
Y'all dreaming about places my niggas have been
I pull out the Superman, Trap out the Benz
That nigga Vic on that bullshit again
But it's okay cause we better than him
Heard one of his songs, took it and played it
You know what I think? Bitch, I hate it
Your shit's whack, your shit's tainted
We not there yet, but nigga we made it

[Hook: T]
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz
Pull out the Superman, trap out the Benz!
