Chorus (The Last Rhyme)

So as you flip the pages of my story
Apologise but never feel sorry
Realist shit that I have ever recorded
Pick myself up from the ground, move forward
Don't ever judge a book unless you Know it
So keep on flipping the pages

Verse 1 (The Last Rhyme)

Damn you should know it
Never took hand out
I just make this music deep, watch me stand out
Like a cut through your vain or the pain in my brain, been through hell and back so tell me what's the plan now?

Insanity is loosing what you feeling, every emotion inside of you that you killing

Been smoking whole day
I don't feel like living in the spotlight, rather get my rhymes right, here goes another night

Damn, I just think of one thing every day
What would have happened if I choose another path
Maybe I would see this world in a different way
Even thou my opportunities lacked

I Been through pain, died inside, hurt a lot, buried with pride
Fame come and go like the money, what else can you take from me?

So everyday that I'm living
My legacy is being re written


Chorus (The Last Rhyme)


Verse 2 (The Last Rhyme)

Keep flipping the pages

I built my name from the ground up
From the bottom to the top, and I know I should be proud of

But everything changes
This feeling that I'm feeling right now I really hate this

Tell what I'm supposed to do?, in this world with religion that is coaching you
I mean, I wanted it all but never expected to fall
A struggle to get out off and the only hope is you, now?
What will you do?
Wow
Seems like you stuck in a position, with the world rotating around you
Corrupting your vision

My brain is tired, my body is shutting down
Ascending to the top but shit, I'm running around
In circles
I bet you never knew what to do until you heard this, guess this is my purpose
