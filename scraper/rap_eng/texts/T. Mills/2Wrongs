(Hook):
Girl why you playing tough
I know things got rough
Yea we used to kick it everyday now I call you
And you never pick up
We be going through some things
Thought of giving you a ring
Give me another chance let me back in your life
I'ma show you that I changed
Oh yea yea
(Verse One):
I swear I love you
I swear I still do
I meant it when I said
I'll stay with you & by your side
Until the day I die
I swear I changed
I did it for you
I don't wanna see you cry
So I lie
And said I'm ok
Just to see you smile
Don't lie
I know you hurtin deep down
Wonderin why it's gotta be you
I know your pain
I been there before
I wanna make you my girl
Take you away from this life
Give you something we both want
A simple life
With enough weed
To Last a lifetime
I'd never do anything to hurt you
Id put a nigga in the dirt for you
I don't wanna be like Kobe
And miss my shot
I wanna be your MVP
The one you call yours
I won't play with your heart
Cupid shot me with a love dart
My hearts set on you
Only girl in my sights is you
You know when it comes to spendin
I'll spend it all on you
Now, Pride
You gave me so much pride
I'd lose myself if you ever died
But I lost myself already
That's why my life's unsteady

(Verse): I could give you
A million reason why
You should give us another try
I'm not goin lie
I'm not the same guy
You once knew
I've changed into
Who you tried to get me to be
Now I'm learning to be happy
On my own
That's why I want a throne
I want you back
But I don't need you
It's a lust
For your touch
It gave me such a rush
A High only I could feel
I knew it was real
But you couldn't deal
With my weight
I was down bad
Only gettin worse
You couldn't handle it
So you dipped
That's ok
Now your happy
And we weren't a mistake
Month after Month pass by
And I'm glad your happy
With your guy
Our last conversation
Really opened my eyes
Kinda the reason I didn't answer you that night
I'm working on myself
On the inside
On My Own
