[Intro]
This is not
Out of nothing at all
This is not

[Verse]
This is what they want
This is how it feel to be Lebron
When ya playing at an all time
Breaking all highs
When the team lose
Fingers point at you and not a five
Man this shit should be a crime
Assisting all my drives and rebounding all my tries
Don't get hurt, hardly tired
Unless thats just of yall niggas
Got shark tails for small fishes
Small talk about large figures
All I wanna know is how yall gon get it
All I'm tryna see is how yall gon flip it
I was rich before I known riches
Dope spot, gold watch, load, cock
Is my childhood memories
But old head put into me move differently than what you see
And threw me cheese for report cards
Every grade I got was a dub a piece
I learned stacking and quality
If you see me now its all you gone see
Nothing has changed
Feel like I'm seeing to much of the same agendas
Different regimes, I'm feelin
If I wanna change the image
I gotta claim the village
Flame the villas
Rebuild it back with the same lil niggas
They turned they back on now we came legiter
As pillars of hope and we can't be lifted
Can't be lifted!

[Bridge]
This is not
Out of nothing at all
This is not
Out of nothing at all

[Verse]
Since I'm my mommas youngest child
They try throw me in the cage like the Golden Child
So I jumped in the swamp with the crocodiles
Every since then, been running wild
Never copy styles
I see how they mimic but this is a given
We is the greatest like Jordan and Pippen
Need no assistance, ten years of Commission
We still with the business!
I'm still an animal, canabalistic
Turning ya wife into my new mistress
Tryna stay out of the system
Watching from snakes and snitches
Nothing has changed but the blunts got bigger
Money get stacked to the ceiling how I'm feeling
Keep a banana for you guerrillas
Core still a killer
Thats word to my momma
You baby pira√±as
You better pay homage, I'm still with the drama
I feel like Osama
Sittin in the hills it a be a cold summer
Making it rain and thunder
Nothing has changed but numbers
Don't get it confused
Over the years I calmed down, don't relight the fuse
You'll make the news I'm skating like Blues
Hoping that Steve don't find the clues
Swervin on booze
Taking it back 2002
Young and restless, never did snooze
Stay on the move
Tryna get paid before I get laid
Stop buggin me please I keep me some Raid
Still rocking rings and chains
Own boss
My chopper work minimum wage to get it Carlito's Way
Nothing has changed
CUT IT!
