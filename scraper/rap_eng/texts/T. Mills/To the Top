Intro: Rappin Ro

To the top!

Verse 1: Rappin Ro

I was struggling at first
It must've really hurt
But I didn't throw a fit
I didn't fall in a pit
I ignored my haters
Now I'm rich and happy eating taters
I just wanna drive my rari
I don't need no lame old car (i)
I was working really hard
Boy I sure was a card
Now I learned my lesson
Work hard and you won't be missing

Hook: Rapping Ro

With patience and gratitude
Also with the right attitude
I was able to reach the top
Not just sit down and sob
Cause I had to keep on goin
And ignore anything that stopped me from flowing

Verse 2: Cream Cheese

Putting all those nights and days
Not just sitting down with a daze
Made me who I am
Now I have a great big fam
I just wanna chill down
And smile and have no frown
Cause my failures are going down

Hook: Rapping Ro

With patience and gratitude
Also with the right attitude
I was able to reach the top
Not just sit down and sob
Cause I had to keep on goin
And ignore anything that stopped me from flowing

Verse 3: T

Elbow grease, sweat, and blood
Is what makes you be heard
Heard as a number one rapper (Rapper)
Not some cheap old candy wrapper
It makes you driving that lambo
Hard work will make you go whoa! (Whoa!)
I'm as strong as iron after my hard work
I work all day in the dirt
But it has good rewards
Rewards that go on your credit cards

Hook: Rapping Ro

With patience and gratitude
Also with the right attitude
I was able to reach the top
Not just sit down and sob
Cause I had to keep on goin
And ignore anything that stopped me from flowing
