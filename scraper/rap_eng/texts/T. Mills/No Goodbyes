Intro (The Last Rhyme)

Verse 1 (The Last Rhyme)

I'm gone chasing gold dust, blow it of the skies, watch the world light up and get super high
Standing for something that people die for
I guess sheep flee together cause this lion just roared
We all equal, we all we feel pain, we all sinners, black and white, we all bleed the same
What does it take for this stigma to be put to shame
Like love got my heart frozen, while I'm standing in the rain
Atleast my ambition lit up in a devilish flame
Who do I blame?
I'm the one that choose this lifestyle
But its cool thou I guess I was chosen to write rhymes
I don't need profanity my shit is real all the time

Now I'm panicking, trying to please all these people,I lost myself in the process, I guess this pressure is evil
All fakes stayed back when this music was promising, when I fell out, they fell too and never got up again
Like the spilled ink from my pen
Yeah

Chorus (The Last Rhyme)

So as my world collides
I say no goodbyes, I say no goodbyes
Yeah
We all got a purpose in life, so let it shine
Like the stars in the sky, yeah

Verse 2 (The Last Rhyme)

Lost the essence of music and my reason to make it
The thought of failing the people that believed in me, I hated it
All the people I needed to prove wrong, said I ain't shit

So I redefined myself through all the bullshit and pain, struggle, pressure, and lies, even thou il never be the same
So here's the new T, cheers to the new me, standing for something true, for all of us,believe in yourself and be you

Patience is virtue, but when you stuck in this matrix, every lame blows up, I'm tired of waiting, let's take
I don't need a big record deal or a major feature, my opportunity lacks but I still box with the greatest, still on the charts with the latest and best of the best, skill level international, with some local flair
Been doing this for 10 years straight, but on the last I established a label to my name
And everything just changed

Chorus (The Last Rhyme)
