And to think that she’s coming home today
All a little wonder, the world’s a better place
And the good news is everyone’s ok
All a little older and everybody’s safe

And time has left a mark upon this place
Lay it down, but don’t be late
You’ve got to tend it like a garden
Just so you know

There’s a boy in a rock and roll band
He’s going to cut his own path
The only way he can

Unlike the writer who never sees the sun
Poor an lonesome writer
Afraid of getting burned

But you have such a load upon your back
Hold your ground they won’t come back
Days of wonder; days of folly
We should have known

We’ll live in a house
That no one has ever known
A gate in the back
A girl is running home
And late afternoon
The light in the room
Will drift to the side
The day’s gone by

And the sky
Will play tricks upon your eyes
When you’re tired
Like on the days of year
When all the shadows disappear

We’ll live in a house
That no one has ever known
A gate in the back
A girl is running home
And late afternoon
The sun in the room
Will drift to the side
The day’s gone by

So go live in a house
Let all those people stay
And give it a name
From some place far away
And time after time
That look in her eyes
Will tell you you’re fine
The day’s gone by
