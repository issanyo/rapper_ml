[Verse 1: Turf Talk]
Man, she didn't do me right
She wanna go through my phone on the late night
And she all in my ear like "Who?" and "When?"
Told me last time that you wouldn't do it again
I'm like damn, she didn't do me right
She wanna go through my pants on the late night
She's like "Who the hell is this? Mine's ain't that size
I got a little bit of ass but it ain't that wide"
I'm like damn, she didn't do me right
She wanna go through my phone on the late night
But she screaming, yelling, putting fingers all in my face, man
I need to make her exit before I catch a case, man
Damn, she didn't do me right
She wanna go through my phone on the late night
I said "I ain't cheating, you need to back up
'Cause muthafucka just [?] a rapper" (damn!)

[Hook: The R.O.D Project]
What the hell is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?
Baby, tell me what you going through. What you going through?
Searching my phone, phone numbers you checking
You question when a nigga get it on
I'm gone 'cause you don't do me right

[Verse 2: Turf Talk]
Man, she didn't do me right
She wanna go through my texts on the late night
She said "Who the hell is this saying we had a good time
That's why you are picking up while I was hitting your line"
I'm like damn, she didn't do me right
She wanna go through my texts on the late night
You said "She was just a friend but I knew you was faking
You can't be friends 'cause these bitches is naked"
Damn, she didn't do me right
She wanna go through my texts on the late night
And she calling numbers back tryna see who it is
Now they talking on the phone like they been best friends
I'm like damn, she didn't do me right
She wanna go through my texts on the late night
She know the time and the place, what exactly happened
The proof is right here, she got all the texts (damn!)

[Hook: The R.O.D Project]
What the hell is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?
Baby, tell me what you going through. What you going through?
Searching my phone, phone numbers you checking
You question when a nigga get it on
I'm gone 'cause you don't do me right

[Verse 3: The R.O.D Project]
Girl, you don't do me right
You be going through my phone on the late night
Saying that you tired of the cheating and lying
And when I come home I need my phone on silence
"Who's [?]?", "Who's Keisha?"
"Who's Tiffany?",  "Who's Lisa?"
"Who's Beverly?",  "Who's Keisha?"
Stop tripping, all them bitches just want a feature
[?] get your swag right
Anyone of them niggas in your past life
Said you never been with a nigga who
[?] more [?] than you
[?] so stupid
He was ready to catch me and go stupid
That's what you get going through my phone
Now I'm 'bout to get up and you gone (damn!)

[Hook: The R.O.D Project]
What the hell is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?
Baby, tell me what you going through. What you going through?
Searching my phone, phone numbers you checking
You question when a nigga get it on
I'm gone 'cause you don't do me right (damn!)
What the hell is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?
Baby, tell me what you going through. What you going through?
Searching my phone, phone numbers you checking
You question when a nigga get it on
I'm gone 'cause you don't do me right
