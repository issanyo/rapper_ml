[Intro: Rock City]
?
Hustle-MONEY!

[Chorus: Rock City (E-40)]
I, I live and sleep on these streets
Cause I have got to get mine, my fam, see, we gotta eat
So when people ask me why, why don't ever I slow down?
Oh, I just simply reply, I don't really know how!

So I, hustle, hustle, hustle
(I'ma hustler, believe me)
You know I hustle, hustle, hustle
(And this ain't easy)

So I hustle, hustle, hustle
(I'ma hustler, believe me)
You know I hustle, hustle, hustle
(And this ain't easy)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Money and muscle
I gotta black belt in hustling
I'm doing my thang
Chain around my neck look like a playground swing!
Unit mover, pockets fat like Rasputia
Ask your chick, I got oil on my tongue
Pimp, I talk real slick, where the real ones go
They don't make them like me no more!
Hustler, I'ma whole 'nother animal
I'ma whole 'nother animal, I'ma whole 'nother beast
I can never switch up, I'm cut from the streets!
Papered up like a fax
I'm rare like white running backs
I'm getting my Gouda
I'ma be the first hustler to set up shop on Jupiter!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Turf Talk]
Let me introduce myself, homeboy
Any MC I will destroy
West, West, West Coast boy
Speakers in the trunk keep making noise!
I'm so fly, I'm that guy
28 inches sitting high
I'm a star, what you thought?
Everywhere I go, they snap shots!
Everywhere I go, they know Turf
Medallions jiggling off my shirt
C-notes keep falling out my jeans
Benjamin Frank, George Washing-teens
Gotta keep pushing, pushing weight
Filet mignon steak on my plate
Staring in my rear view can't slow down
If getting money is wrong, arrest me now!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Rock City]
They ask me, "What you're doing bro?"
I say that I hustle everyday
My men don't sleep, we always up
Cause we can't live off minimum wage!
Middle finger to the other side
I know that I just want to get paid
When you hear this one go and turn it up
From Virgin Islands out to the Bay!

[Chorus]
