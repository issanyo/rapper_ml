[Verse 1: Turf Talk]
I pull a heater may never follow a heater man
Even though we try to smoke the weed man
Put up, or shot up, my loot up is wassup
Wha-wha-what would you do as I shot yo hood up
Even jealous my weed
I take the cups
Thats F.A.B. not Fabulous
What it iz
Sick wit it it iz
They way this money look I'll be indepentdent for years
Is a gang of hood niggas eatin' off this plate
So don't come over here if you ain't from this place
Here me coming bout a half a block
Got a D in my silly for doing the robot
Catch all kinds of us
More kinds of thugs
They offer designer
More Kinds of drugs
I'm Married to the air
Pistol under the battery
Dopes in the air

[Chorus x2:]
Thizz, oh we sick wit it
We iz, super sick wit it
Scraper, Scraper, pull out the rippers
Purple, Purple, gone of the liqour

[Verse 2: Mistah FAB]
I don't need no urns
All I need is freaks
F.a.b. what they call me
Worty they mouths weeds
I do the dummy, retarded, and ride the yellow bus
Put a dent and a father be doing hella much
High speed in my car, call it a scraper
Pop my p's and yours bras, come for a ripper
I only roll wit my folks, family, and mexicans
Run away with what I have, I'm a pedestrian
Hit the club, and I'm mad cause they won't let us in
Now I'm about to go bad like drunk mexicans
You know I'm mental and sumo, but I be holding weight
I Got love for the East Coast, but this is Golden Gate
I'm from the band PI, we don't surf talk
Since I was a PI a PI, i do Turf Talk.(yee)
T.H.I.Z.Z
Droop-E you too hard, you need to be easy

[Chorus x2:]
Thizz, oh we sick wit it
We iz, super sick wit it
Sraper, Scraper, pull out the rippers
Purple, Purple, gone of the liqour

[Verse 3: E-40]
Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka, it's real ugly
Sk's and Ak's, in my Sentai
Not the pretty aka's that go Skee-Skee
But the ugly ak's that go Stoopy
It really doesn't matter major feature or factor
Walk up on that ass, you can have it in the bladder
It's all about the money and the credits and the fat
The rolls gone change, jewels and ear rings
Turkin, drinking wiskey some
Am I suburban, dropping off counters
Tryina place my bids, tryna get in this bra
Spit my lrp's, in Fairfield much
You can find me in the party getting spiffed and twisted
See me in the club and I'm double fisted
Higher than the Statue of Liberty, extra tipsy
Playing possum, acting like we dizzy. (BIOTCH!)

[Chorus x2:]
Thizz, oh we sick wit it
We iz, super sick wit it
Sraper, Scraper, pull out the rippers
Purple, Purple, gone of the liqour
