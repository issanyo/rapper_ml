[Intro: Little Bruce]
Ya know? Out there smashing them scrapers. Getting they papers. Sliding on
Them groupie breezies... with the vapors. Yadamean? Scrape to this, my nig

[Verse 1: Little Bruce]
I cop me a 4-door Cutlass Sierra
For only 6 hun' the deal was done
The body straight and the engine run
... Hit the way, went did 121
It's great to see my boys in gold-tone rims
Plus some fresh new blades, 20 inches
Now I'm smoking fire, on Nitto tires
Hit my nig on his Motorola wire
My beat in the trunk, can you hook it up?
I'mma hit the sideshow, and cook it up
In a scraper? Nigga, I'mma make it spin
Hook up some nitrous and make it win
Four 15's with the TV-screens
Stock sunroof, I'm hella clean
Thought it was a 500-SCL
With the rims and beat, who could tell?
I'm riding thick man, smoking power
Reese in the back seat, tooting powder
Little Bruce, man, boss from the Villa
Clowning in my fresh whip, speed-bump-killer

[Hook: Little Bruce]
(I'm scraping) Scraper... Scraper... All about my paper
Siding on your haters, dark as Darth Vader
Scraping in my scraper, knock and bitch and rake her
I'm all about my paper, scraping in my scraper

[Verse 2: Turf Talk]
I'mma ride this bitch like a Benz (like a Benz)
Candy paint, 24-inch rims
... Love the soft leather on the clothing
And a lotta niggas hating, but all the bitches show
And a lotta niggas ride on my rims to keep balling
We gone pull up, get out, but keep going
Never mind Mito the dub, I'm tycooning
Gotta hit the supercharger when I make a move (err!)
Park in my new shit, hear me, courage
You can ride the blades on the gold tippy-toes (tippy-toes)
If you want attention, put a whistle on that ho
Open the door, so wonderful, so cold
Sirens go while I diss the window (window)
You can get in if you like the indo (indo)
And Robin 'll be the personal pimp though (pimp though)
Holding the Kelly like hoes on hydro

[Hook: Little Bruce]
(I'm scraping) Scraper... Scraper... All about my paper
Siding on your haters, dark as Darth Vader
Scraping in my scraper, knock and bitch a rake her
I'm all about my paper, scraping in my scraper

[Verse 3: Little Bruce]
Cutlass, Pontiac, Chevy or Buick
I don't really give a fuck how you do it
Candy-apple-green, burgundy-wine
Tangerine... or the kiwi-lime
Put a dub on it and scrape to the O
Get a quarter-pound burger and shake to go
Roll one more while we looking for the show
It was still early so I scraped to the 'Sco
Nigga I'm Pretty Tony, going berserk
Hit the tenderloins and shake for work
Bitch, don't call without a rack or better
A pimp like me wanna see his cheddar
The same way you see yourself in my rims
Don't get dizzy, cause they don't stop spinning
Just found out where to get that Gucci
I'm finna be cleaner than a virgin's couchie

[Hook: Little Bruce] x2
(I'm scraping) Scraper... Scraper... All about my paper
Siding on your haters, dark as Darth Vader
Scraping in my scraper, knock and bitch a rake her
I'm all about my paper, scraping in my scraper

[Bridge: Little Bruce]
Scraping in my scraper, all about my paper
Siding on you haters, dark as Darth Vader
Scraping in my scraper, all about my paper
Knock and bitch a rake her, it's dubs on my scraper
Scraping in my scraper, all about my paper
Siding on your haters, dubs on my scraper

[Outro: Little Bruce]
Yeah. We doing the damn thang. What up. Don't forget, when you riding and
Siding... We doing it like this: Scrape, scrape. Oh boy, it's big
