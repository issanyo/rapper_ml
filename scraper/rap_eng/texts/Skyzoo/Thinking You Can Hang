Mannerisms of a young Stringer Bell
The way I define quiet but to whoever try and riot I kno the gun slingers well
One pump and then they fell is how we saw it where I'm from
But know that everything is mum so we ain't saw not a one
Not a scene, but believe if we needed to repeat
It's nothing for us to go for what know and the delete
I mean, money showed us that it make the world go round
Neighbors got it off of 9-5's or 4 pounds
Everything is numbers
And a 4.6 is really everything we wanted, it's whatever in this running
My team, Brooklyn through Queens, got it sewn by the seams
Forgive 'em for delivering the leans
Brothers where no one can cut us
Had to turn away when Avon and String gave up one another
Shit was real, I did the knowledge
Driven for dollars and bitches that swallow
And pray against it tomorrow in a hood near you, what the fuck
