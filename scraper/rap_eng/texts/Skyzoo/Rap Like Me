[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Okay, rap-wise back mine
Up to where I'm backed by
Everyone you homage so I'm cutting through the back ties
That sidetracked mind smothering the stat line
Truthfully my pen ain't been the same since Stack died
That might be another reason to react, like
That might be enough to see if they see that line
Pack mines see it through the seams and what the scratch like
Act right see if you can see what the collapse like
Wonder rap, hovercraft, Sky fly effortless
Fuck around and sit on top of Mozgov neck with it
Blake shit, makeshift, ladder that I can step upon
Rap nerds get to shooting at him like they Meadowlark
That serves that the truth is at 'em but they never caught
That curve, get to shooting back like they could wet a blog
That merged just to proven that I'm what they never saw
Smell it through the bag, baby that's how we be peddling

[Hook: Skyzoo] (x2)
And they don't rap like me, and that might be
The curse of all cursive, rap by the tree
And the perfect beyond perfect, if that's what it be
Then I word it beyond worded, I'm back to what it be

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Blue and orange everything, clearly what I'm repping
And the pressure that come with it like I'm wearing number seven
So I'm 39-10 if you should dare to disrespect it
Good money from the corner, put your ear to where the net is
Good money from the corner, put your ear to where the net is
Three meanings at once, and should clearly try to catch it
See that how you want, so you hear it how I sketch it
But you see that as a must and that I'm clear out your perspective
They don't do it like, spew it like
No clone drew up like
No Brook and Robin Lopez, no two alike
See the arm, see that ya'll crown him for you see his song
Prematures need applause I just need a Nia Long
See the R, see the god, see that where they seek the god
Swear I leave the beat alone if I could be with Nia Long
But back to what I be up on, trampling over Sampson
You can smell it through the bag, baby that's what we be G-ing on

[Hook] (x2)
