Skyzoo Verse:
I was the shorty on the block always watching the Roc
How they would ride for town, I just wanted a spot
Felt like they had it all, hunger for standing tall
Next to who we saw as the greatest to whip up a bar
Fast forward to me becoming a king as well
Studying footage had me hooked and now I'm thinking sales
Started to make a few ends, but know just how I need it in here
'cause he playing with 600 M's
Seeing myself in his rise, I moved from Levi's
To PR's and APC'ed my regime
Then time start flying past and seeing where I be at
And hearing that I influence the newest of lobby rap
I see this kid who coming up and Tryna make a name
I hear a little a dose of me in how he paint his lane
He got his thing together
But I can tell off the way that he out here pushing ain't nobody do a thing to help him
I kno the story to the point where I feel like I wrote it
How mufuckas never loved us, they wanted us broken
Promise to always pay it forward if it comes to me
And shoot these lames outta the way before I cut a scene
I'm out here Tryna turn our sorrows into sweeter cash
I can help shorty blow out like Onika ass
Plus I can relive my rookie year thru this rookie guard
FGR my team, it's time to put him on
