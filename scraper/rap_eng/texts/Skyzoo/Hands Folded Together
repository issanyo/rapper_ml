[Verse 1]
Truly yours and not a string attached
Ringer rap, a loop involved?, you bet I bring it back
Singer rap is not at all what I be swinging at
I know too many singers for me to tune up a note
So for me to do what they know is for me to do what you don't
My hands like I'm LeGrand, I'm D to shoot up the goat, ha
Quote it, cause idol aiming is the height of training
You cover that and that'll cover back from how they played it
Made it, at the top where it's just us
It was me and then I took on the lead and pulled us up
I'm in the cut like additives, balance what your batter is
I turn Steph Curry and dance on ;em like packages
Whoa, wait, I'm just doing what I do best
I'm from where you either move or don't move without a vest
Whoa, wait, I'm just true to what I protect
My hands folded together, the proof inside of the checks
Know the motto right?

[Hook]
Hands folded together
One size fit all
These plans go to whatever
Winner takes all
And stand over whoever
Free to ride along
But it cost to wanna help us
Know the motto right
Hands folded together
One size fit all
These plans go to whatever
Winner takes all
And stand over whoever
Free to ride along
But it cost to wanna help us
Know the motto right

[Verse 2]
Release what's in me, besides the Henny its ink outta '95
With day ones who at a blink is down kamikaz'
Behind the ride but inspiring the drive
Like the engine in the back so you're behind your attire
Wait, engine in the back, luggage in the front
So you're behind your attire like tucking a button up
OK, comprehend it easy, tailor made
Sell black and white over black and whites, they compositions need me
I just take a couple stanzas, price tag the banter
And spend it on Phillipe's like velvet chicken's the answer
Art talk with zo catchers and scramblers
Weigh out the pay out and may y'all see anthems
Theme music for seeing to it and weaving through it
The metronome is herringbone how we're influenced
Step alone, my stepping stone is G rooted
I never rome, I'm better home, keep it the truest
Know the motto, right?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
You can't continue to miss me over and not reap the repercussions
Me putting careers to sleep just only keeps the reaper dusting
Himself off, for you cowards beneath a thousand deaths
I bet if I watch you kick it like a FIFA crowd
You'll probably mix your reefer clouds with meth, cause its not sane
To try to match up, with this octane, you're far from Oxford
With your ox brain, when punchlines hit, as if I box train
It's hard to keep me inside of a boxed chain
Once the weak link within the lock's strain, ripping free and stretch
From my slick talk, that at times is too slippery to catch
I could've been a giant, walk through, crush the buildings
Run you up outta town, set up and ask for high rent
That's next level thuggin'
I'm a poet and you ain't even know it
Like champagne soon as they slip the drug in
After they pour it, it's better to go with your gut feeling than be heroic
