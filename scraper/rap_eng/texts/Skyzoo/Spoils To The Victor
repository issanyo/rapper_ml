[Verse 1]
So you pick out your lane
And turn Kramer with the room if they get you some paint
With no open mics for you to go blow your lights
But shit they don't hear you anyway they just listen for names, mine is in a lane that I ain't ever get to widen
But I could barely fit I almost had to whip beside it
Cause duke I wasn't put here just to settle for the echoes
I'm more so in sprinter trucks and dinner with the Blige's
But still around the way, around the corner by the projects, them youngins on the reach is Cardi B'ing with them rockets
Or calling up Maria for a liter
Maybe white, maybe tan
Singing out like G&B as far as product
The girl and the boy, G&B, see the logic?
If we debating Grammys 'least we even on the target
I'm targeting a dollar and a way to make it dance
The irony of playing yin and yang with all this profit
The spoils to the victor

[Chorus]
Spoils to the victor, spoils to the victor
Zipping up a bag, and the bag a lil richer
Zipping up a bag, and the bag a lil richer
Said they Tryna aim it at
Whoever fit the picture
Maybe y'all, uh, maybe us
Maybe y'all, uh, maybe us
Maybe y'all, uh, maybe us
But do believe, that when we up
It's spoils to the victor

[Verse 2]
Do believe, easy as the truth can be
Mookie from the jersey to the J's, all beautifully
40 and a mule or whatever if we do agree
Easy as a stop & frisk turning to a shooting spree
DT's jumping out the back is nothing new to me
Truthfully, I be more surprised when they ain't moving me
Said to zip a bag without tryna fit a bag like get to running with Your bag or you'll be running to your eulogy
Graphic, pardon me
Let's just make a note of that
Snapchat etiquette, like I ain't mean to show you that
We be in the crowd that they seem to be around
So if it's cars to audience, then seat us where Oprah at, and don't a day go by
That we ain't tryna blow by
Complicated repeats, all of this is bow tie
First words we knew
Buy low, throw high
Write it in your prayers baby, know why?
Spoils to the victor

[Chorus]
Spoils to the victor, spoils to the victor
Zipping up a bag, and the bag a lil richer
Zipping up a bag, and the bag a lil richer
Said they Tryna aim it at
Whoever fit the picture
Maybe y'all, uh, maybe us
Maybe y'all, uh, maybe us
Maybe y'all, uh, maybe us
But do believe, that when we up
It's spoils to the victor
