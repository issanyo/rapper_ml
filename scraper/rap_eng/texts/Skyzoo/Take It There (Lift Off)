[Intro:]

One time
On the "Lift Off"
But I promise it's not gone go where you think its gone go though
It's goin' somewhere else
Just bare wit' it
Yea

Take it this far right?
Just like the hook say
Take it this far
Take it over there wit' it
Okay

[Verse 1:] Skyzoo

We took over there
Across the street wit' it
They dissecting when I was just trynna eat wit' it
And my block like Sky whatever you need wit it
They tool on the tires like Bodie so if you creep wit' it
They on they whatever now
Never knew how never sounds
We ain't to used to never we just used to what they left around
Turned that into u-turns
Never planned an option
My block is full of u-turns
For every Nancy Botwin
Trynna be in this
I let it breathe a bit
And give you a bar to catch what I was leadin' wit'
To them I'm a star and I'm what they believing in
So given the odds I'm oddly what the even is
When I talk slang
Or when I encode it
It's all for where I hang
And where my zip code is
Cause all of us the same
So when I get a flow in
They know I'm givin' lane
Enough for us to float in

Range Rover ryhthm
I said it on the first
That's where I put the ceiling
Probably since birth
See I never planned on wearin' a book bag
Or however you put that
I was trynna cake and take it where they ain't took that
They misunderstood
They couldn't listen and look
But either way
They faves turned missing for good
So when I say
That I'm about digits and you get it and you bitchin'
You obviously didn't get it

Cause if you understood the background
You'd be wit it fam
It was either try to whip a verse or try to whip a scam
Said that I could write so I was writing for the kids who can't
I wrote on a desk and left it there like
There's ya chance
If you go to the schools that I went to
And you sit by the rack
There's a career on that desk
Just my way of giving back
And if you understand that one and you understand where that's from
You understand why I'm all Louis and what that does
Now Wikipedia and see where St. James is
I'm able to brag and say my neighbor was the greatest
I played for the flag and kept it wavin' through the mayhem
Now my neighbors will brag and say they neighbor is the greatest

Of the new
So fuck who's cosigned
Cause when we do toast bay we'll be toastin' mine
Mine dolo
They love you then then they hate you regardless whoever you are
They be trynna fuck up ya name like Chris Brussard
And I'm just trynna jump the through the rain
Get my move on
In and out of drops like no one you never knew pa
So pardon what I'm on
But I'm on it for a reason
Justifiably so
The so-and-so's that be speakin'
Is not at all in the like
So that comparin' them to me shit
Dikembe on the draw
Tell em' everything is defense
Take that how you want but I'm wanted by the elitist
And I'm just trynna take it where Bey is
You heard her right?
