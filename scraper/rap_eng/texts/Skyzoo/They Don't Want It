[Intro] [Skyzoo talking]:
J Dilla on the drums. Huh. Custom Made Entertainment. Let's go

[Hook] [Skyzoo]:
They don't want it
Nah, they don't want it (they don't want it)
They don't want it
Nah, they don't want it (they don't want it)
They don't want it
Nah, they don't want it (they don't want it)
They don't want it
Nah, they don't want it (they don't want it)

[Verse One] [Skyzoo]:
One for the money, two for bitties and pretty cars
Three for Hennessy, Dilla beats and Biggie bars
I rap better than whoever you got your paper on
And my kick game like Savion
Put it together, it's none better so they call me "The Flow-er"
But y'all don't get the message till your check don't show up
Believe I send the word and your name's on all four
Internet game's like Paul Wall's
As far as my set go...
We blend with the drums like geckos
And Spalding bitches, we check hoes
Check two models at the same time, blowin' a bone
One black, one white, call it Oreo dome
I'm good
And y'all runnin' with your battery charged
But you look like a DeBarge and you sound like Marge
Get the fuck outta Dodge when we in the room
Tell 'em C.M.E.'s the dudes
At the end of the day...

[Hook]

[Verse Two] [Torae]:
My introduction to rap with Nino's introduction to crack
If you move the work smarter you can double your stack
So I doubled my work load like the Carter was back
Then move bars like a prison attack
Tell them niggas get back
When grown folks talk and respect the speech
The rap MLK and I have A Dream
My squad seeing me, to spell y'all E.N.D
That's lights out for niggas who can't read
It's my air nigga, you can't breath
I inhale in the booth
The exhale will sound better than you
I'm light years way ahead of ya crew
And take orders from no man
My niggas tell you what to do
But here's a little bit of advice to use for the moment
You need to not fuck with the dudes that I roll with
Wrote it, spoke it, tote it and have 9th record it
I tried to give 'em a jewel, but Sky, they don't want it
Nah

[Hook]

[Verse Three] [Yatta Barz]:
They say I ain't gettin' busy no more
My game stepped up, I elevated the floor
The bottom's lookin' thin, that's exactly where I'm from
So my heart won't forget cause the pain is within
This ain't a love song, this is the war zone
You better lace up your shoes, put your gloves on
I'm at 360 and I ain't turn the oven on
So that bullshit you callin' 'hot', there's nothin' to him
Think I got my back against the wall
Bodies all around it resembles a morgue
Last man standin', first man dumpin' with the cannon
Abandon, your ? should've canned him
Anybody that ask me about Sky or Tor's biz
They gon' go Up In Smoke like the tour did
And now you really hotter than you think
Osama Bin Yatta comma, the problem's in the ink
But they don't want it

[Hook]

[Verse Four] [Zeqway]:
Back to business, flow ridiculous
Y'all know I'm sick with it
No antidote to fix the shit
The tradition is no form of switchin' shit
Do your crime, do your time, grown man business
Stack chips and all kinds of dividends
I let it rain, right where your river ends
Fast laneing in the whip, fast laneing with your bitch
Stack change till I get rich
I ain't playin', this is it
Cause Zeqway's on his bullshit
Your act's weak like Busta Rhymes in Full Clip
And when I speak, the whole streets asks "Who's this?"
The black boy with stripes like Adidas kicks
You ain't seein' this and it's nothin' but G in this
And y'all pussy, nah, matter of fact y'all tuna fish
Yeah, I'm Slick, just a fact, I'm ruling this
And y'all ain't movin' this, I move bitches like Ludacris

[Hook]
