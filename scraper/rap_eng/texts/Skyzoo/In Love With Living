Verse 1:
While I'm watching everybody watching my 1-2
My shit is butter so  I kicks that off the humble
I keep my head, both of them where if you come through
You get knowledge, give knowledge and then our run is through
I'm comfortable but I'm drained, I feel one in the same if that makes sense
And your kind can't blend in with mine if you play the fence
My pain wish it was quick to see
But hid it under gold chains for all your disbeliefs, like this is me
When it happened it never bothered me
Kept 'em on, badge of honor for you and yours to see
My squad and me was cashing out on who we wanted to be
If I was Shawn then A was Ty-Ty, arms in reach, that's all I need
'cause where we from got valleys and peaks
Black holes and glass roads to carry your dreams
Happy to leave cause off the way that we was raised, ain't no maybes in this lane
Aspirations took the wheel and we became who we portrayed
'illing for Currensy, saw B.I.G.'s road and yea it worried me
But my zip code need to be worry free
So I forget all that I knew, convenient amnesia
But I do remember how you looked seeing me with the Jeter's
Suites at the hard rock, see ya later
Sneaking outta STK, paparazzi on they're way up
This way the only way you'll be apart is if you're made
And we can have a pleasant time sipping Ace of Spade, what you say?

Verse 2:
My mind is infested with black excellence
That black out Range Rover looking like Precious
And I, channel my inner mid 90's for the Lexus'
Where throwing a wing on the back came off as heaven sent
God forgive us for all our harsh intentions
Our heroes was up the block and gorgeous cars was with them
My heart raced at the thought
When they was busting a U'ey the long way by the court
My innocence disappeared, I'm living within the glare of the shines that we saw
And now my vision is impaired with all these blinders on
You guessed it, manifested in intangible goods
And believe day after day I still stand where I stood
Rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
You remember us as living up to what they was talking
True this, these streets schooled us to spend our money foolish
The sneaker man and the jeweler was running thru us
Pause, I stepped it up another level like the looters
When the duplex is loaded and the drivers are the shooters
We pray at night like "may the hype be a-alikes"
My PR's is cuffed over my Foams, they're laying right
For the win, for the now and forever
The outcome is mu'fuckas won't ever forget us
Dirty hands with dirtier plans cuz we need checks
But I'm connected to Gayle King over at CBS, you see me stressed right?
