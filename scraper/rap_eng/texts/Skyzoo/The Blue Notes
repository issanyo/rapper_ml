[Intro: DJ Revolution]
I represent for the blue
The blue, the blue, the blue
Who cares?

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Uh, word to the bluest note
Speaker words, none truer spoke
Speaker words, I do em
Raised on what you raised on
If I know you then I knew your folk
Flow references flow par
Touch the clouds of the bluest smoke
Do the most, most don’t make it to see much
So vile for me to pull me the seat up
Out come’ll make ya’ll leap up
Run around screaming out deeper
Keep up with these Blue J’s
Gamma 12, touche
Handle well new aims
Expand yourself, new page
You like half my name
Knew that I have my lane
You trying to double on me
He only learnt half my game
Blue like most of the boots
At the corners where we peruse
They look for the bluest veins
I look for the bluest loops
Now I ran through what I write too
Pros and cons that my life brew
Friends trying to keep their lights on
So they’ll come through and ignite you
Lights on till they blind you
Bring blinders cause you liable
For your own sake, I remind you
Like four shades of that can do for the blue

{Chorus: DJ Revolution]
I represent for the blue
Never underestimate what I do
Cause I do it better than you
My grade get reduced
Don’t get me confused with the rest of them dudes
(Seen them you know, the blue coming through)
(Brother, brother)

[Bridge: Audio Stepchild]
It was full moon, April 9th
Who cares?
(Seen them you know, the blue coming through)
Yow
(The blue, the blue, the blue)
