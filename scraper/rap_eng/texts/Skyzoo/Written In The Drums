[Verse 1]
Ok, written like I'm Nasir, predicting in 5 years
Y'all will understand what I been kicking on the contrare
Contrary to the popular and what they all share
I'll be sitting where I'm high enough to hit Lamont's ear
Product of ebonics but that AP, made me
Balance out the cameras when I handle where the great be
Handling what I handle when I'm handing you that hd
Homicide driven but we tripping where the cake be
Out of line penning they was trying to find vision
I was filling in the blanks that was provided by they ignorance
And I be just as ignorant, according to the grind
Paper my agenda, and the flow is to coincide
Call me proud to be a testament, prolly he who repping it
Made him understand it through a crowded sea of negligence
Swam against the current, get from round me if you question it
We be in it till it's nothing left in this

[Hook]
See it's already written in the drums
So I ain't got to talk to it
But if I should decide to, I'm the one to honor it
If I should decide to, I'm the one they own it with
But you know they be on it till I'm gone
See it's already written in the drums
So I ain't got to talk to it
But if I should decide to, I'm the one to honor it with
If I should decide to, I'm the one they own it
But you know they be on it till I'm gone

[Verse 2]
See it's already written like I'm Christopher, corner store literature
In the most literal, you don't gotta picture us
Know it off the open, you ain't got to front and center us
Motherfuckers doubt until they viewing what attention does
When you was watching me on 106 like how you get up there
I was on a 20 minute call with a billionaire
Boomeranging ideas on how to get my million here
Told me get rich or die trying before you're finished here
Got it 50, glued to every word that he would serve
And in return I make him turns like if he said what better product is
And I'm just trying body this
Should money bring me loneliness, I'll be here alone counting out like yeah the lonely wins
Maybe you ain't know me then, and probably never will
I'm from where everything that matters is a dollar and a pill
So if bottling emotion is a battle for the kill
It's either that or go and bottle up your ills

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See it's already written in the flow a little different this time
But the wizardry that lyrically assembled this line it's like
If I'm selling phones like you could get these on the go
In a weather 20 low and they ain't scheduled till July
And if you figured out that line and you resemble what resides
Within the souls of these foams, the worries and the strive
The upscale vandal, the worries put behind
I write on mahala and serve it through L'Chaim's

[Hook]
