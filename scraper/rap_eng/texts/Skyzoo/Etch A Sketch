[Chorus:]
And I’m nothing [x3]
I’m nothing yeah
And I’m nothing [x3]
I’m nothing yeah

[Verse 1:]
Yeah it’s been a minute
It’s been a minute since I truly did it
Since I shitted on all of my critics
Yeah they say perfectionism isn’t perfect
That’s only because we haven’t scratched the surface
This Etch a Sketch has yet to catch some wreck
Your face is red and I ain’t even found my message yet
Investing reinventing everything I’ve ever said
I’m resurrected with this pen
I’ve dissected the Led Zeppelin
It’s like a box that I’ve been kept in
I ain’t preaching to the choir
I’m just trying to get the attention of the reverend
Interrupting the reception
It happens when I say it
I’m talking about the shit that you stepped in
Quentin Tarantino with this music shit
It seems your short films have been misdirected
Infectious, your poems don’t even know what chess is
I’m so awake and that’s exactly why I’m feeling restless

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Yeah clear the canvas let me Van Gogh it
Portrait of a poet reinvented here to advance
The motors to Etch a Sketch
Story in retrospect
Or redirect rex the most deserving of respect
[inaudible 1:46-1:48]
I’m a chameleon
Devising into a chapter
To capture experience
After we’re dead and gone
Legacies living on
Strip me to bare essentials
As our pencils revers fall
Barry Bonds without the needle
He’s without the eagle
Jesus without the adoration from people
New lens to see through to truly see
Who we be when we be who we are
Cuz my mirrors imaging a vision displays a star
It’s just arithmetic
Back to the simpleness
Thinking N for infinite
I’m learning the gimmicks
This is the rebirth before I rebuild to yield figures
The realists remain the realists
[?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Yeah and they call me SKYCOO
Dance on them like this
Legendary what are saying like my head roll
When big bro but still up about a big zo
With friends that let a clip go
I came up in a zip code where mercy’s never sinful
And so the bottom line is lord have like flip mode
Somersaults are the MO flipping off the free
You saw it courtesy of my aforementioned hero
Now for the present day
Down to my resume
The G, the FBI likes surround to the letter H
Moneyball everything
Ground up let it spray
Primitive mind
I’m around here to devastate
The sky looks splendid
One time for the winners
Staying pace with the pop
Front line for the women
The way the rhythm do work
Is the way they let us do work
The ride is for everything baby
The ride is tremendous
I’m on a porn alone, die alone, count the whole pylon
Load the oven up into the truck
And then I’ll get gone fuckers
Load the oven up into the truck
And then I’m gone
Load the oven up into the truck
And then I’ll be gone fuckers

[Chorus] [x2]
