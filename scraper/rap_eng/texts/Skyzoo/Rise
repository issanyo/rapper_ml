VERSE 1
Lately my hearts heavy
Preaching behind tints stained glass in the Chevy
She said it would be days like this word to terry
I mean i just watched a innocent teen get killed because his skin matched his skully
And a young Latin teen got her innocence took
Witness say Papi went Thata way they ain’t even bother to look
That seems to be a trend make America great again
I can only ask when was then
I mean we supposed to wake to Dr Kings dream
But we need saving ya (Highness)
Still they want us to buy into the American dream Knowing that it was made in China
Killing over designers
Moving with life’s ups and downs cypher merry go round
Now picture how that sound/
Pardon if my words bother but he was killed moving still
Knowing tobacco fields are filled growth’s important/
Rose without a father still we rise from the garden
As we grow into Spartans


HOOK
Just like a fire I’ll burn through the walls
And if there are mountains I’ll climb them all
Like a warrior fights to win the war
No matter the plight
I’ll stand up fight
Oh Yeah! I will rise!



VERSE 2
Prayers for whoever’s put before me
‘Cause they gona’ need them more than I will
And should you ignore me
When let that be the thought that you blame
When those around you say that you gave them reason to support me
I’m everything you taught me
Though be it from afar, the more treacherous it should get
The more calm my waters turn, the irony of patience
Define it with the greatest, and know that when it’s on the fight rise like a cadence
‘Cause ain’t no fear in the doubted to hesitate with
Ain’t no clearing me out off of trepidation
And ain’t no care to surmount with I’ll walk away with
‘Cause ain’t no hearing me out if it be forsaken, right?



HOOK
Just like a fire I’ll burn through the walls
And if there are mountains I’ll climb them all
Like a warrior fights to win the war
No matter the plight
I’ll stand up fight
Oh Yeah! I will rise!



BRIDGE
If we made a list of gems to co-exist even how to
Would you give its praise or would you get it appraised
To try to depreciate its value
If we far sighted off of confusion
I can give you my lenses
To see what I see if it helps the resolution
Now picture us standing strong together (huh)
Now that would probably spark the path that would light the way forever



HOOK
Just like a fire I’ll burn through the walls
And if there are mountains I’ll climb them all
Like a warrior fights to win the war
No matter the plight
I’ll stand up fight
Oh Yeah! I will rise!
