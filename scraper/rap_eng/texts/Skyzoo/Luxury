[Verse 1]
Designer sweats off designer plugs
My fan base peddle crills or designer drugs
Money hand over fist like a Steiner glove
Drop jeep, box seats what I remind you of
Aura of the city, everything that I came for
In a carry-­on, I carry on like a wave board
Handing work to whoever like if my aim's gone
Fly murder forever like "get your name Lord"
Devil wears Prada, Hitler wears Hermes
I be in Celine with your queen going burlesque
Either that or Supreme, I'm supremely the deity
Crowned off the point how I weave where the needle be
And it's leaving legendary if it come to me
Rep means everything, mine means luxury
And we Tryna turn bread like Harpo
Talking Marlo with a Partlow arms fold

[Pre-­Hook]
If I don't make it bet the fam will
Watch the city fall in love with us
Clyde Frazier with the hand skills
Double rings baby, double up

[Hook]
Wore the same Balmains outside for a week straight
Fronting like we ain't rich
Baddest chick you ever seen in your life
Pulling bottles all night like she won the chip
You know we here for the luxury, yea
You know we here for the luxury, yea
Until we filthy with the bank roll, yea
Know we here for the luxury

[Verse 2]
Winning lasts forever baby, swear to God it's like we won already
Word to counting everything that we done drunk already
Only thing that they can say is that they wasn't ready
For real, salute to how we was brought up
Fly guy etiquette turned us into marauders
How I throw etiquette 'round the way they taught us
In short chains and Balmains how God want us, ha!
Luxury, see where that'll get you?
With a Cici Amor Tryna be like Karen Civil
Print game silly so my Nike Tech gorgeous
Casper the friendly, writing for the Forbes list, ha
Yea, Earl the Pearl when I'm at it B
So who you love is being me, all flattery
Flattered to be what they never was
First to the money, everything is FGR

[Bridge]
Crowns all around, we about a win
Luxury talk, everybody want in
All day ones, with it til it ends
Counting up together, same as it been
