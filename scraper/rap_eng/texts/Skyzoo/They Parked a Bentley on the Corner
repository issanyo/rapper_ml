[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
They parked a Bentley on the corner
Pulled in the baddest bitch you could've thought of
Hit the roof and all we smelled was sour and vanillaroma
Hit the drop down on the window, pushed a 100 out to touch us
Hand sticking out the dark it was like a Nas cover
I was like "if God love us, that'll be us like tomorrow"
I mean shit could be today but we ain't weak enough to Borrow
Know the season on the way, we can keep it at tomorrow
Or sweeter than Anita if it need it to be in sorrow
And we caught up in the rapture of 100 in the trunk
Tryna serenade the flip, couple lines, hit the tuck
Off the rip like it was Lionel, rest in peace to Chinx
I'm just looking for a SUV, especially a brinks
Get a hit and shit'll switch like y'all can keep y'all goals
Floor seats with Bay and Melo and Leon Rose
And I suppose
My addiction off a Nostrand Ave vision set the continental bar for living
They parked a Bentley on the corner

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
They parked a Bentley on the corner
Wide body frame, quarter water
We was young and tryna run and we was floored from off the aura
Star gazing, ain't no way that this is right here on the corner
We was young and tryna run up on the bitches, Jackie Joyner
They was talking like it's easier to run when you ain't running
Understood it off the bat and wanted to be their 2nd coming
Looking up towards the ave, now or never for the pace
Get to running to the bag like Teixera on the base
Know the trace, know the outline, jumping like your alpines
A' was like "yo I'm just tryna drought mine"
Duly noted, money at the wheel started talking all kinda drop
Told us "swear to God it started with a Foamposite box"
Eyes wide, listening, hearing out the vision and
The riches that's attached and how it claps at your attention and
It's feeding your addiction and
A Nostrand Ave vision sets the continental bar for living
They parked a Bentley on the corner

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
They parked a Bentley on the corner
A Bentley on the corner
And as quick as we saw it
It became all that we wanted
Pay for it in $20s, they'll be counting all morning
The money all local but the dreams all foreign
That's a Bentley on the corner
A Bentley on the corner
And as quick as we saw it
It became all that we wanted
Pay for it in $20s, they'll be counting all morning
The money all local but the dreams all foreign
That's a Bentley on the corner
