[Verse 1]
I be in here, like Biggie watching over me
59 be low on me
Way I'm sounding you think I just reach up like he wrote for me
Pull these out the air, grab a pair let this go for me
Tying these together like I'm roping these
Getting to the point, like it's dope in these
Picture what this dope could be
Diddy bopping like if Diddy out here on the road with me
Diddy bopping like if this Ciroc is about to open me
Let it open shorty first, keep a couple close to me
Me alone and a pair of Js from when he was on
Saturdays at twelve repping Pro Stars these is those
Those is all they looking for
Look for me to look beyond
Imitation's flattery that explains them looking on
Bass sound something like a tre pound
Enough women here to have you wondering if Trey 'round
May ya'll mingle long enough to live a life and stay around
Drinking long enough if this your type cause we be like

[Hook]
Trying to get this going for the evening
You standing on the couch like you want me to see your secret
Drink whatever you want, double fist if you need it
As long as you ain't spilling none of that shit on my sneakers
For real

[Verse 2]
For 2012 the only MC with a flu
In Jordan 12s, see me how I'm keeping these Flu's
Know the story well, know what we on it like
Camera phones everywhere, I promise you saw the hype
Know what we call it like, living for cargo
Christopher Kane hoodies, shit is two car notes
Shit that you all know but some of you might not
Black-out Louie belts, corners is white hot
But we okay and so are they
These bitches is from the K
Bad as Selita Ebanks and scamming like Oda Mae
Lionel Herman on the work in
Ten Stigwood Ave
Be the surface Gordan Gartrell tuck my shirt in
In it for the dub like the 20s round
C-O with a CEO singing buck em down
Play that how you want it now
But it's still now or never
Deck of cards the way all the spade lay together like
