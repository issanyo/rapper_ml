[Verse]
The revisit of “For The Awake”
For all of them who seems to listen for long as it take
And all of them that seem to get it
And all of its traits
And never wanted me to differ or lower the stakes
I covered y’all on the before
Called for a detour
Time-time on the dash
But pardon if I reach off
Draw songs for the stash
And offer them to see raw
Eyes wide shut like the barbers on the Seymore
Call it like it be called or better yet wasn’t
Visionary beyond, but never left from it, the loneliest
Leroy Campbell when I Crayola this, the loneliest
Paint staircases like a custodian
Kyrlon’d over them, drawn my soliloquy
I Rain Man’d so none of them couldn’t mimic me
Jesus Christo forgive me for the interludes
I’m trying to get them to know what they wasn’t meant to knew
The past tense, the miss scenes we didn’t shoot
You asked them how missed me when I did for you
So forgive me for doing for I
And if you can’t, then fuck it I ain’t too much surprised
Respects showed me I’m designed to play the stand up part
The vets told me I could sell mine on grandpa’s art
But the hearts wasn’t out enough
Arms got the rounding up
Maybe they alarm wasn’t loud enough

[Hook] (x2)
So this is for the sleepers
The hard to be believers
Who couldn’t understand
Nose bargaining to see us
Took it underhand and the honor of the leaders
I just understand and I’m signed up as the speaker

This is for the sleepers...
