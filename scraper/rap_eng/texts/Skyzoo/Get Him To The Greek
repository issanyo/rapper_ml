[Hook]
She said to me Sky, life is for living
I get right to the living before the light of my ending shows
She said to me Sky, life is for living
I get right to the living before the light of my ending goes
Get him to the greek (x3)
Meaning me, I'll get me there
Get him to the greek (x3)
Meaning me

[Verse 1]
Any windows of middle men in between
Littering through the dreams of trying to get from this Z to this A
In them windows I'm literally on the lean
If I get to be seen I'm slipping up on my dean for this pay
I don't need no eyes to see no stride that we bow tied
So I'm hoping you closed yours if I should speak so wide
I hope you know the allure and why it seems so high
And I'm hoping that closed door behind me don't pry
I mean the booth is all I'm looking for
You and yours I look towards
Trying to build a bridge that I could uniform to push us off
Know me off a homie but to know me is to look beyond
Only for the lonely so I'm lonely if you put me on
Itching while I'm waiting patiently I'm impatient
But my mannerisms tell you I may be the one to trade with
Tell them I'll be back tomorrow my briefcase on the table
You can keep it, its more where they came from
If you play it, I mean

[Verse 2]
As I play the bench after this chess move is properly made
I see the middle disappearing if I lock this today
I see that middle interference that was blocking my lane
But coming clearly incoherent, they done dropped out the way
I mean I'm clearly in the clear, shake a hand out in this park
And I can hear what they don't hear so if you hear me where to start
Then I'll be there to play the rear, take a stand and say remarks
I won't remember a name, place my hand upon my heart
If underhanding is an art, you tell them I'm Kenneth Gatewood
But the forbidden innocence isn't anything they should reflect on
Or worry yourselves worries don't sell
If a word is to be uttered then we should worry for real
But in the mean time, we've lined ourselves with rewinds
Meaning I'm back as soon as I leave cause these fly
Meaning I'm back to pursing my lea, I see eye to eye with you
The mattress seem logical, but my sleep differ

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Parallel to the she in question
And based on how she be dressing
I made this an easy catch and ironically
I'm caught in the same G I threw, lost between me and you
Call it the sweet pursue, but I'm trying to leave
And that I was hoping wouldn't pry
Is kissing my shoulders as I pushed to the other side
She kissing my motives as I'm looking under her eyes
I kissed her like fuck it
As long as I'm still alive, I'll do this to death

[Hook]
