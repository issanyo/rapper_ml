[Verse 1]
Hand off like it was potent, 
Or like it was emotions, or like it was reloaded, 
Or like it was the start of what you was starting to go with, 
And as soon as you started it every part of you noticed, 
Coupes out in front of the 'jects, tall numbers, 
Or cooped into whatever's left that they bought from us, 
Shop don't close 'cause the neighbors change, 
Same way cops know to roll when the date say 
The 1st to the 3rd, a g-pack could make it all seem better, 
Until it's paddy wagon car seat weather, 
That's year round, the thought of who's here now interrupting a sale, 
Or pulling up on a Citibike and wanting some crills, 
It's all basic, Venmo begging, call it patience, 
Know if you get caught up with them, the call changes, 
Dusse by the cases, do say what's the wagers, 
And please do believe they do say what your name is, for real 

[Chorus]
Call it heirlooms and accessories, 
And peep how they all hang so pleasantly,   
Now go pass that to who you love, 
And tell ‘em to treat that like weaponry, for real 
Call it heirlooms and accessories, 
And peep how they all hang so pleasantly,   
Now go pass that to who you love, 
And tell ‘em to treat that like weaponry, for real 

[Verse 2]
Two states over to stay up under, 
Numbers ain't matching but you can still make these wonders, 
Like, wonder if all of these pieces is still shooting, 
Checking on a meter to see if one of them thru with, 
All of 'em get to moving so you moving, 
Swindling a store like swindling an award, 
I'm, more Issa Rae, if we're sorta the same Ima support, 
And carry all of that with me to the door,  
Like carrying last names, 
Or carrying a pistol for the minute that bag came, 
And opening the bag to see it's nothing that bag claimed, 
And carrying the calling of them seeing their last days, 
Unless that bag change, 
Or carrying honor like you carried a stance 
Or being asked by your neighbors if you can carry your man 
With 5 others, don't nothing surprise none of us, 
So whoever surprised would kill to come outside and live beside one of us, Til it come to the numbers, 
And one of those 5 get called to jump up inside 
That pine and you get to running, like fuck it, 
It's prolly safest to just live it off a playlist 
And tell us how it provided inspiration 
I’m inspired by knowing that pots really work, 
Shots really turn a starter into a martyr if the top send a word, 
And word be in the air like picturing what you heard, 
And know whoever's looking is listening to it first, you heard?

[Chorus]
Call it heirlooms and accessories, 
And peep how they all hang so pleasantly,   
Now go pass that to who you love, 
And tell ‘em to treat that like weaponry, for real 
Call it heirlooms and accessories, 
And peep how they all hang so pleasantly,   
Now go pass that to who you love, 
And tell ‘em to treat that like weaponry, for real 


[Verse 3]
Consider what just occurred, 
All that could be got and the feelings that could emerge, 
And they said that they get it but to see what it be worth 
Is asking for them to see off of the curb, 
‘cause they saw it but all of them told me they got it from here, 
Long as they're dealing with product in here, 
Know the whole line up is bout it in here, 
Won't no one ever have problems in here, 
All of these baggies they got up in here?, 
Fuck could they ever be worried about?, 
Snipers is on, swipers is on, 
Shit is like they never heard of a drought, for real, 
Like "what the lick read?, we just want everything lit B, 
As long as you kick it at this speed, we can relate to all this G’s, 
Trapping up out of an M3, light work til the Range come, 
We be out here with the right work, light work, shit is A1”, 
And so, I heard it all and replied, I bet you I know it too well, 
Catching a lick is a high, you just gotta know when you fell, 
Fell into a bag that you can flip into a couple more, 
Now you in your bag and shit is hitting like you fucking thought, 
"He said that's just what I mean", and he got to popping a zan, 
He got a spot up in reach, he said he got him a plan
Plan goes, "anything goes when opportunity knocks, 
Fam knows, we gonn' let it go, do what you do if it pops!", 
They get to spotting the vics, Balenciaga's is lit, 
They in the spot with the stick, like "ayo they got it to give, 
So ayo they gotta get got", they get to rolling and rocking the spot, 
Do it and get in and out with the grips, 
Neighbors is watching the property drop, 
Snaps is litty, mixing the Dusse with Henny, 
Hammers tucked under the Fendi, neighborhood know you get busy, 
But that neighborhood ain't a gimmie, it ain't been yours in a while tho, 
Same custi's on citibike's is pointing out pictures with 5-0, 
And all of the change that you saw 
That you igged cause you thought 
Would never change how you're on, is everything you knew par, 
It's everything they shoot for, based on what you’re here for, 
They never could've been more right if your type is to hear wrong, 
Heirlooms and accessories, all hang so pleasantly  
Pass that to who you love, treat that like weaponry
