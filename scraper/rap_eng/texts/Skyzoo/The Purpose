[Verse 1]
She was looking for what they speak about, 
Becoming such a believer now, the more that she be around, 
The more that she see a reason to see it out, 
Thinking like "how could I be without?”, 
And without question, without guessing to figure out the connection 
And being in it and leaving her dealings out by the exit, 
And knowing the baddest bitches is eating off her reflection, 
Crown holder, remember to lean when you accept it, 
Let it, be the company, 
That attracts the same when you be in need of company, 
Til you believe in company, 
She said "it weigh more than you think, so keeping company 
Can seem overrated if you don't own your patience”, 
Said it go for the taking as far as taking it goes, 
And you'll be forever mistaken if your stake in it grows, 
Type of shit that keep you nervous, 
Like how this just the surface?, and how no one deserved it?, 
Shit that give you purpose 

[Bridge]
And the purpose of it, as far as she know, 
Is finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, 
But knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, 
Way up out the way from where she able to see tho 

[Chorus] 
Word to my love
Word to my time
Word to my heart
If your love is divine 
Can you give me something more than I can see through?, 
'Cause I just wanna trust and believe you, 
And the purpose of it 

[Bridge]
And the purpose of it, as far as she know, 
Is finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, 
But knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, 
Way up out the way from where she able to see tho 

[Verse 2]
And so when I seen her, it was like
She was at a point where she might be out, 
But figured out what she might've found, 
Talking finder's keepers, when you find it you keep it and bring the light around, 
Especially how they lifting the prices now, 
She shows that off by all means, 
Along with the heels that's walking thru y'all dreams, 
She moves like "pardon me", I'm moving like "par please, 
I just came here for her”, 
You feel like you did the same but couldn't stay for the worth, 
So you broke before you broke thru, 
I was in line for the dope like I'm a local, 
And I taught her what hope do, 
Said she heard about it but it only made her hopeful, 
And I ain't getting high alone so I sling her the dope too, 
To see her prophecy, her ebony tone is locking me, 
The way she moan when she be taking the whole 9 from me, 
Fucking up a bottle of privilege while we debating, 
I point out what a privilege it is to see her sacreds 

[Bridge]
And the purpose of it, as far as she know, 
Is finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, 
But knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, 
Way up out the way from where she able to see tho 

[Chorus] 
Word to my love
Word to my time
Word to my heart
If your love is divine 
Can you give me something more than I can see through?, 
'Cause I just wanna trust and believe you, 
And the purpose of it 

[Bridge]
And the purpose of it, as far as she know, 
Is finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, 
But knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, 
Way up out the way from where she able to see tho 

[Verse 3]
Where she's able to see tho, was all she thought was left for her to see, 
Told her I would be remiss if I ain't catch her up to me, 
Made a part, play the part, getting dressed for her beliefs, 
Told me those was Botticelli's when I swept her off her feet, 
Knew the issue, but seen between the hands, 
Cool on triple, Kima Keisha Pam, 
I pull up in the new shit, see how we can work this, 
I bring up her tomorrows, she bringing up the purpose, 
And feeling like the purpose of it 

[Bridge]
And the purpose of us being here, 
Is us agreeing on how everything we see in here 
Is nothing that we ever saw before, so to be in here, 
Is us assuming we won’t ever have to leave from here, 
You said all you wanted was a purpose or a reason where, 
You would never have to doubt what you believe in here, 
And I’m looking at you like whoever used to be in here, 
Made it tough for us to breathe in here, 
Because the purpose of it, as far as she know, 
Is finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, 
But knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, 
Way up out the way from where she able to see tho
