[Intro: Stalley]
It's like I am being pulled down
Funny how I keep my head up
It was slow dough then it sped up
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Slow dough never made it in my neighborhood
A buck 50 for a buck 50 any way we could
Nike Roshe'ing to the payment for a Meagan Goode
And pulling Mach 5's just the way we should
Way we should, carry this agenda til the closet looking like if it was carried thru agenda and we married to December
Duffle bagging with a dealer to repeat it and it lead
To duffle bagging with a dealer for a key in by the weekend And the roof is in the trunk with all the caution and the patience
Lil room towards the front for all the talk of contemplation
Thinking fuck it tho, weight on the pedal to play the Petro
200 on the gas means 200 on the dash
I need a 100 in the stash, couple runners, couple masks
Or, get to playing tinder with the flip, couple bags
Let my neighbors tell the story of the runnings on the Ave
Know the lane is automatic if the running under wraps

[Pre-Hook: Stalley]
It's like I am being pulled down
Funny how I keep my head up
It was slow dough then it sped up
(Repeat x2)

[Hook]
Slow dough
Never made it in my neighborhood
It's more Jesse Owens
With the owing's if it's paying good
So we be tryna run baby run to the pay out
We be tryna run baby run to the pay out

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Uh, on a relay to turn a check to a replay
And call up Je≈õus like "tell your pops to give us leeway"
Forgiveness in the wing but sitting on it like a delay
Play the scale and pamper the fish like you was Wee-Bay
I played the rails and threw my autograph on the lobby walls
And made it famous rapping 'bout neighbors and their Bobby jaw
Same ones was telling me to run towards the bag
And do it til you get your number hung up in the rafts
I did it thinking more like Eldridge Cleaver over re-up
But knowing that the bag is almost finer than Aaliyah
Pretty mufucka we just wanna come and see ya'
Pardon my approach but I just know how much you need us
Until it turns different and you're sitting on the phone like an accomplice
Wifi on the flight, face timing with the bondsman
And I'm my brother keeper so my Expedia clicking
Bill and Russell off the muscle, word to a flight out to Memphis
Do believe it though...

It's like I am being pulled down
Funny how I keep my head up (Sky what up?)
It was slow dough then it sped up (Apollo what up?)
(Repeat x2)

Slow dough

So we be tryna run baby run to the pay out
We be tryna run baby run to the pay out

[Verse 3: Stalley]
(Correct) Slow strollin' in my 87 Supersport
Looking for a quick dollar so I can let the chains pile up
Tryna have my next smothered gold collar
Blue collar the set, Hands covered in grip
I've been grindin' all winter so I can shine a bit
Me and my conglomerate huddle on street corners with bud lit
Plant life, planet nights all on a semen
Marathon trappin'
I got mileage on these Air Max, from Soho to Fairfax
All my niggas air mac's and blare tracks from non-other
The flow butter, no stutter except from the money counter
Its funny how they tried to clown us now its commas after commas, million dollar houses
Gain blouses, stain windows, marble floor with the rain fountains
Used to cash checks at Western Union now I got paid accountants
Im up now from broke down and Ima stay countin'
Nigga
