[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
My pops said "timing is money" ain't it?
I prayed over my watch and promised I wouldn't waste it
No sir, and it's no blurs, no vision tainted
Nor is the hue on this inf beam, ain't shit adjacent
I'm in a place where to aim is like tryna kill a basement
The same basement I drew up on dreams in a basement, Money loud, like the only way we can live is blatant
Until it muffles the crowd and then it get complacent
Bet placing, 3 dice, triplets
Keep mine in trips and I need mine in sixes
Pardon me G-O, I'm a Capricorn with tendencies bordering Leo
I was told that I would be Birdie but wanted to be Theo
I was 12 falling asleep to the thought of a kilo
I was 12 in advanced classes as bored as a free throw, my mother's biggest fear was me coming home with a P.O
So I never came home with one, never saw the back of a cop car
But saw the back of a cop soul with his Glock drawn
And saw the souls hop out of the women I hopped on
And saw Paesos on the V.I. like "Sky Dawg it gotta be you"
You fathered everybody out on the move
Rappers doing alotta ugly tie shopping in June
I'm on the other side of the table like none of that's important
But still I'm smiling on it cuz it's obviously true
I'm true enough to admit
That we grew up the same, we grew, up on a flip
As if that was God's word
Intriguing how God works, and, how a rod works
And a bent card works, and how we thought it the same
And you get caught in the aim, of my side by sides
Birdies on a Hail Mary like, "la da da"
Rumor has it Bro is like Von Miller on the line
You false start and shit'll turn thriller on a dime
I'm just filling in the time that I promised I wouldn't throw out
Tryna catch a lick with my ace boon 'fore we close out
I move around lower than Ace do when I roll out
Hennessy blood stream, I bleed and it'll flow out
And due to the circumstance that we was all placed in
The only way that we'll be complacent is off of payments
And there go that word again, see how we all waiting?
The easier the truth the quicker you'll all face it

[Chorus: Patty Crash]
Knee deep, chasing time
It's like I'm standing still
Got no time to kill
No sleep, can't rewind
So I walk alone
King without a throne

[Refrain: Verse 1]
My pops said timing is money ain't it?, I prayed over my watch and promised I wouldn't waste it
No sir, and it's no blurs, no vision tainted
Nor is the hue on this inf beam, ain't shit adjacent

The same basement I drew up on dreams in a basement, money loud, like the only way we can live is blatant
Until it muffles the crowd and then it get complacent

[Chorus: Patty Crash]
Knee deep, chasing time
It's like I'm standing still
Got no time to kill
No sleep, can't rewind
