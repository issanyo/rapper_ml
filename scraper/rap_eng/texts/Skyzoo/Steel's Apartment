[Verse 1]
Sex money and murder
All the decorations they set up under the curtains
They sitting here singing they never wanted to hurt us
And never would they ever
So I guess they made good on they're promises all together
But maybe they really didn't
Meaning they really did get to semi auto lifting
Ricochet reasons when they ricochet rabbit us
Trick bullets that'll stop mid air and mallet us
We just tryna duck it but they bucking like if practice was
Targeted to here, out the window with this view
From this apartment with a stare
That'll make you wanna see more
All of this intrigue will make you leave from outta these doors
And look for where Quiles is
Bigger dreams penciled in, hennessy adrenaline
Throw down, stand up and die for it like blizzard did
40 ounces on 40 degree days
Penning 40 bar verses wit 40 on each page
And writing around the holes
I'm running outta room when I'm writing so I suppose
My pose is more in depth
My pose along the steps is home so to the death
We was built to play the right and I chose to bust a left

[Hook]
Dedicated to better living
Spending on better women
Took it and ran wit when they said we better get it
Like we was doing good but we doing better winning
And knowing there could be no better ending
And its dedicated to never living
Spending but never getting
Took it to stand wit it when they said we'll never get it
Like we misunderstood them wanting to never switch it
And knowing that this shit is never ending, and looking back on it
It all started in Steel's apartment

[Verse 2]
One in the same if there's something to say
Something to say like I was still just the one to remain
One to remain like I was dealing wit one in the cham'
One in the cham' like the feeling there is nothing to gain
Nothing to gain like I'm wheeling in to jump in that lane
Jump in that lane like revealing I was one in the same
It circles back, and we just tryna jump in that ring
Jump in that ring like if we won't get to jump in again
I mean, like, all we wanted was opportunity
And even if we couldn't be exact, we knew the means
Even if we couldn't see a stack we was true to dream
And even when we got to be in that we never knew to eat
Fucking something or at least we was pursuing it
And ordering lobster fried rice if we was doing it, ha!
Young and wide eyed, sprung off of Diddy crew
Like word to Puff wait til we get in these living rooms
Or better yet I, cuz I was all alone in a basement full of eyes
That was similar to mine, wit no similar in rhyme
None similar to mine, and we kicking it like shit is live or die

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Cause we once a crew of youngin's of the same kind
Quick to holla up at something with the same line
Never changed so if we out then ima still roll
And let the feeling remind us until the feeling's gone
