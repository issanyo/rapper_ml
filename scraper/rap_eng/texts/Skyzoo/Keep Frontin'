(Verse 1) Skyzoo -

Expecting the unexpected
Stretching out in a record
Like barely fitting in it but fitting it nonetheless and
The flow without a question
Is cut from a reflection
Of ducking under a weapon and running under the exit
It's that exact, it cut you outta your ceiling from where it matters at
New edition your vision, shit is cataracts
Can you stand rain shit, panorama basements
Hooking for your heals dude, candyman grave shit
Box with a tomb or, box with the roof off
Choice yours, '91, black sheep loops on
Follow, stepping like I'm fretting over bottles
And your echoes got us measuring your hollows
It get for real, realer than fear do
As real as a rear view
With po-9 loading a clip that you should adhere to
The henny white but as brown as Solange hairdo
Told 'em that it's bagged as soon as mufuckas hear you

(Verse 2) Billy Early -

Some say I sin
Even when drinkin' gin won't guarantee the win
Then pretend I'm afraid or offended, speak of men
I'm with him at after parties actin extra again
Keep a grin as i start to begin, and
The game is sick we rappers' penicillin, pinch and pin up lyric Like a posta' Lord willing yall that intuitive
Spittin' scripts rippin' in my feelin' bust and split your lips
"Cussin' stick the hips with sharp cryogenics tips"
Sit still or i'll clip ya like an envelope seal
Never "drill" but the disrespect gettin' to real
Why, my home town hatin' cause I'm hot so whateva'
"Ill, keep running to my tracks thinkin' all that was cleva" Cough at cochella, run it like the fairest on loops
Take your shot it's documented i ain't scared of the truth
Do this 'til i'm grown tearing through the paper with my phone
Why my vest full of lead?
Jealous rappers aim they best at your head so

(Verse 3) - Stik Figa

Man to man let's just get it established
Before you send a tweet and start deleting your status
Deny you violated and say that it never happened
I'm just five percent rappin' civilizing the savage
So keep advancing just start giving me credit
You walking like a giant you been living with legends
I never got time to waste no splittin' a second
And just a little food for thought and I'm giving 'em seconds
Don't miss the message homie, go and get a placemat
Log off the Facebook, lil buddy face facts
Be careful what you say, some of that you can't take back
And lil homie stay in your lane if you on that race track
And if I had to guess, I'm guessing that you lack respect
I don't react to threats laughing at the Baphomet
Running circles round these squares ain't broke half a sweat
Sticking to my guns but never carried a Mac or Tech BOW!
