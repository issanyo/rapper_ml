[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Wassup with the vibes, wassup with the vibes
We just Tryna keep it where the aura stay alive
Like pardon us for breathing like if we in '95
Shit we just Tryna double everything that come to mind
So wassup with the vibes, wassup with the city
I'm double sole, grey bottom grown if you dig me
I'm G Rap in the pocket with Apollo on the symphony
The top come off the truck like if "duh-duh-duh man" was with me
And I'm from out the 'Stuy, they call it do or die, like please don't let all these urban outfitters lead you blind
But we just Tryna vibe, shit we just Tryna vibe
And get a couple City Scapers jumping in the ride
And park in front of Soco back to back like we in line
And leave the speakers jumping while we take over inside, ignorance is bliss and bet there's beauty all in mine
Like we just want the city back to be in it's design

[Hook: Skyzoo]
Wassup with the vibes?
Wassup with the vibes?
Wassup with the vibes baby
Wassup with the vibes?
(Repeat 4x)

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Wassup with the vibes
Wassup with the payout
I'm here to make it shake before I skate up on my way out
I'm AZ agenda, either one, know what they 'bout
I'm top 5, feet up on the table, move the plate out
Now wassup with the vibes, and passing up a crown
I play the 808 like I was backing something down
Like pull up parallel and get to backing back around
Know I'm from the 'K so that's exactly how I sound
Addicted to trophies, so bet that's what I shoot at
And bet she talking replay if I ever go and shoot that
Women crush passenger, 7 on my jersey
An arm in my PR's, double meaning, early, addicted to trophies, so bet that's what I shoot for
I shoot like accolades is the only thing the roof for
Wrote like half your playlist so I'm all up in your two door
So either way you put it im exactly who you root for
