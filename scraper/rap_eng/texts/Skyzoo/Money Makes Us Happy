[Hook]
Scared to death
By this race I've run
All that's left, is everything I want
And I'm slowly losing my time
Quickly taken back from me
Seems my friends are few
Mama said prepare to pay
Cause happiness comes from money
Happiness comes from money

[Verse 1]
Money makes us happy and, happiness is everything
And everything is now and, now is more than never and
There'll never be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so
If you can quote the prices of your happy then get at us yo
Get at us yo, learned it from right where you saw me posted at
Grew up holding on to it all unless there's hope attached
Cause me?, I don't hope for much, uh, if anything at all
They said your cue will depend on what you can bring along
So we was bringing everything that mattered to us most
It was money and it was cars and it was habits to keeping both
It was hundreds and it was scars and they just happened to be close
It was hunger getting involved so then it was back to being broke
And we just wanted a shot or 2, Melo on the follow through
Promised me it would open these doors the way that they promised you
So I just do, whatever it takes to fuck with it all
And enough to buy my way next to Jesus if I get lost, swag

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And they say money makes the world go, money makes your girl go
Money turns some of its earners into something terrible
Ask yourself where did the person who was in the mirror go?
Why am I unrecognizable, so unbearable?
In the pursuit of paper, it was then I wasn't there with you
To do it over I'd've taken better care of you
It costs money for the birth, more for the burial
Purposely I'm saving up to purchase us a miracle
We want more but need less, desires and requests
I guess moving constantly at this rapid speed just
Effected my velocity, then the evil got to me
And strangely, it fucked around and changed my philosophy
I always heard it's not the quantity but it's the quality
In all honesty, past mistakes seem to follow me
Sometimes I feel like if my psychology will swallow me
So my apologies, what's my problem yo?, it's gotta be the money

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And it was falling out the sky like if Doug E. Fresh was performing
And we already had too much and so we was brushing it off us
In pictures in front of back drops til like 4 in the morning
In all of this Dapper Dan for all of your dapper adornment
Or its falling on the badge in the murder of pick a name
And my name fill the blank and I'm blanked and I drift away
And you kiss my cold cheeks, chicks crying like I was Cochise, would you stand up
And send me a slow speech?, because money makes us happy and, happiness is
Everything, and everything is now and, now is more than never and, there'll never
Be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so, if you can quote the prices of
Your happy then get at us yo

[Bridge]
Money
No surrender now and no restraints
No complaints
(Lord knows the price will only raise)
