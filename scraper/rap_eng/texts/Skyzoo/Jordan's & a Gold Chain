[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
And still is
Shit it still is depending where you living
And I'm still in the 'Stuy so "do or die" is still religion
And Louboutin imprints where bitches know the difference, and diamonds are forever so I'm still about a prism
The now and the later like it's sitting in the prism or prison, depending on if you pronounce different
Wait, that's Alotta lines, let me pull back the limits
I mean that's only half like when I'm throwing her my rhythm, but back to the soliloquy
Like back to it literally
Where all of this is off of the back of the truest vision
The sight shooting 20 for 20, cut in twos
And the theme is Carmines and visits to Russian Jews
Find me in Carmines at Carmine's, a check on my neck and my chicken parm is soft fried
Just following tradition baby

[Hook: Skyzoo]
Giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's & a gold chain
Was living it up, like yo it is ain't it?!
Word over here is that it is ain't it?!
Well ok, 'cause I'm in mine now
Giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's & a gold chain
Was living it up, like yo it is ain't it?!
Word over here is that it is ain't it?!
Well ok

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Now how can I perfect this?
Living reckless
Die for my section
The same one where you can get killed without any questions, cops and exes, whether past tense or expected
Like who you was fucking or wherever your last breath is
Or breathe like a Breevort anthem for where the 'Jects is
It breathe different like blowing rent money in Red Stix
Cuban Linx grams with a lavender fluorescence
That's 5 mics all on your necklace
It's just what we wanted to get what we wanted and sit on the numbers
Doors off like the winter's the summer
And put a check on rewind where recollecting is fine
Tryna loop it like if we forgot to signal the drummer
Preached to us like if there was a plate set in front of us
And loud like if a clip was emptied out like if we found where the drummer was
Hands in the plate that's in front of us
The same ones mimicking whatever the drummer does
Just following tradition baby
