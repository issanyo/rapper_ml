[Verse 1: Torae]
You fucking with the best in the Borough
The Barrel Brothers of Brooklyn
Ain't nobody give us a lane, fuck it we took one
Niggas was hooked from the door, peep Skylar and Tor'
More like Walter White and Jesse the way we cook it up pure
And Sha distributed it raw, nothing cut nothing stepped on
Look like the days of the narcoleptic execs gone way
Niggas was slept on
Fuck it he kept going, every sixteen that I breathe gimme a Flex bomb
Came up deliver it mean, that’s word to Hex mom
I’m bout my team my nigga eff y'alls
This upper echelon squeeze till every clip in the tec's gone
Fuck wit a broad until the check gone, ex con
Present day, Rover Range matte black switching lanes
Necklace glisten chains, overseas switching planes
You ain't incarcerated get ya chain
Cause F.T.R.I.A. came to click and bang
Get 'em mayne

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Got em where they calling me Tyson in 86'
I get that involved when handing off to make 'em flip
Know I handle bars like handle bars and play the grips
Turn the cannon on and handle y'alls when I'm laying dick
My rep as great as it gets
I’m young, pretty, I hit hard
I’m the best shape of my life I'm on my lift off
My fan base is going state to state in a zip car
My only down fall is my belt is covered in lip gloss
Play the nickels and nines made a grip on the side
But dance all on the base I'm Jadakiss to the Stuy
My mans cornered the base like they was kicking a rhyme
And ya hands all on ya face as you wait to get you a line
Two for one, double meaning, and double what we is
The doors open when floors open shoving the key in
The more dope that I toss over just showing me is
That your flows is your throat juggling me in

[Verse 3: Sha Stimuli]
No one on Earth is dope as we
See my flows forbidden
I'm as slick as the serpent that spoke the Eve
Move with no religion
I can walk in church just rolling weed
Lord I'm only kidding
Please look at the person I've grown to be
Peep my soul has risen
I've driven through Hell fir
My life was flame infested
I've passed and I've failed some tests and escaped from a jailing sentence
In the belly of the beast jumping rope with whale intestines
I was Jonah now I’m over your head you can feel my presence
My curses appear as blessings
So I laugh at any man
That would oppose me knows that I'll attack 'em where they stand
These dudes spit garbage like they salivary glands
Come from sanitary vans they got imaginary fans
I hit beaches in the winter I get January tans and
Bitches call me winner I put passion in they pants
I'm an advocate for abstinence cause no ones effing with me
I will stab you with a javelin for acting like you can
My district flips fools
Quick trip if you
Spit sick, switch hit, jab, stick, stick move
Misfit, pricks get, bitch [?] tunes, 6-6-6-you
TICK TICK TICK BOOM!
