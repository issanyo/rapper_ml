Okay

[Verse 1:] Skyzoo

They say I rap like my parents was Olu Dara
Gloria Carter
Voletta Wallace
Cause the margin that I throw you started
Where if you caught it
I applaud you
Because no two starters
Can run you the 1 into 2 the way I float through the conference
I mean I'm
In royal blue with white stripes and a "1" in front
But "45" lurkin' behind like if you wanna jump
And if he tries
It's do or die
I'm up and under son
I turn heroes into posters on a one-and-done

Regretfully doin' so
The respect that I grew to know
Is still in tact
But shit is a wrap if you do approach
And listenin' back
You figured that that was where they blew they smoke
But givin' my track
The shit that I rap is like a sewer hole
Live from the curb lights
By left
Serve right
Easy pass club
They live and die for the turnpike
This holdin' on shit is gettin' out of control
Cause the Optimus Prime in me says Sentinel gotta go

I'm LeBron in July
I'm Melo in February
I'm alone in these confines
It feel like they've yet to hear me
"Clearer Hearing" was in '09
I'm clearing near a gold mine
Ridin' at ya neck
Ear to ear call it Bow Tie

I give em a minute to get it
They get it they wit' it
Admittedly in it
Beginning to ending
Of what you remember
Remember the difference
Cause that shit is different
It's differently written
From sentence to sentence
And given the image
Of what you've been given
This shit is a Reynolds
And listenin' in is a privilege given
So get it then give it and go

[Hook:] Skyzoo

Gone off of this and that
Gone off of this and that
Try and grab hold baby
Gone head and listen back
All em' is missin' that
Called for a different pack
Trunk fully loaded baby
Gone head and get to that

Gone off of this and that
Gone off of this and that
Try and grab hold baby
Gone head and listen back
All em' is missin' that
Called for a different pack
Trunk fully loaded baby
Gone head and get to that

[Outro:]
Yea
Yea
Gone off of this and that
Yup
1-2'n it
And they call me
S-K-Y-Z-O-O
S-K-Y-Z-O-O
Yea

Got the idea for this off the Twitter though
I wasn't even gone hit this beat
Shout to @baron_samedi7
He the one who said I should rock it
Good lookin' fam
Yea
