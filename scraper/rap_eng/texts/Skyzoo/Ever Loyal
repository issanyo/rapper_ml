[Verse]
Ever loyal
Skating from Mrs. Westlake, but she bad
I should be laying with Mrs. Westlake, and we had
Copies of Shakespeare on vinyl
Magic Johnson posters but blue and orange idols
And through all of these haiku's
I'm back on my Michael
Which ever one, between '89 and '98
Providing it by the day and driven by being driven
Inspired to drive away in cars with less room
Either that or getting picked up in cars with stretched roofs
Where the only thing that's not in the car is the restroom
Cause when Jada said his car had everything but a bar
It inspired me to want refrigerators in the arm-rest
First half of the calm yet
Meaning that the storm should be coming like a cartridge blowing
Double meaning
Shit, to know him is to be him
Either that or at least see him
And he usually be at Farmer in the deli if you need him
You can tell him by his sneakers
Never tied and never kinds you can find in the retail
Fiends get excited outside when they see Mel
Meaning that the sneakers are shipping in
And whatever pair I got on I'll probably give to them
Stringing these together through loops like where the symbol is
If you could walk a day in my shoes then you can sit with them
That was kind of high, pardon me for throwing that up
I assumed that you would've knew and followed through with some backup
But my pocket is gorgeous like Lolo Jones
So even if you couldn't catch it you could go off flows, right?
Gordon Gartrells and Creed cologne
It cost a bottle a Spade, shit to each is own
I smell amazing
Ever Loyal, the perils of being Theo, we call it Ever Loyal
The perils of being Theo, we call it Ever Loyal
