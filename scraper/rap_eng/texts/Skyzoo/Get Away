[Verse 1: Termanology]
Fresh off tour, been on the road for a whole year
Back to back, beer-liquor-beer, beer-liquor-beer
Hangover, headache, let my dome ventilate
Reflect on the disrespectful words that I said to Jake
Last night, too bent, runnin' off at the mouth
Drunk words, sober thoughts, easier to spit it out
Feelin' like I need a vacay, been up for 8 days
Stage after stage, afterparty, parade
Let me explain, baby girl my energy's drained
I ain't tryna fuck, just give me head and I'm straight
I need a king sized bed, four pillows and a comforter
Drunk textin' baby mama, guess I'm still in love with her
Really you be stressed when you're down on your last
And you gotta choose, buy food or buy gas
Tryna get away, somewhere there's less lava
Reminiscin' on bein' a getaway driver
Stupid shit, hustlin', shootouts, movin' bricks
Fuck that, I'm tryna relax and kick back
So I feel I gotta

[Hook]
Get away (x8)

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
From the most humble of beginnings
Where 4-5s tumble in the scrimmage
I made it out the button of my ending
My getaway was out of the norm from what the leisurely do
Cause for me, OG was worth a Jeter or 2
And still corner store Sky, still scams over everything
Rookie year, hands built to get a ring, word to first blunts
Cuttin' class, first wifey, she was nuttin' fast
Never bragged about who I tagged, always wore a bag
On my dick, pants sag on my kicks
OG 3s or royal Foams, them fatigue shits is lame
I grew up around the corner where they squeeze before they aim
And then they explain it later, pissin' in elevators was my usual
Now I'm more MCM suitable
My fan base is part time models with corner cubicles
I get away with one of my supporters at the show
If you seen her, you'd get why I forever wanna go and get away

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Torae]
Sometimes I gotta get away, put the mic down, I don't spit today
Hardly smoke, but I need a spliff today, Henny cup sip today
Just kick back, not doin' shit today
Might cop some fits and some kicks today
Go see the Knicks today, they play the Celts, need some tix today
Bet Term and Reks for some chips today
Might text your chick today, she been beggin' to give your shit away
Second thought, nah, that's no getaway
I need some Hathaway, castaway
Treat a Wednesday like a Saturday
Drama go thataway, commas move thataway
It's more money, more problems
But with no money ain't no way to solve 'em
I'd rather revolve 'em than involve 'em, be a slave or be a sovereign
Get away cause any day could be your coffin
And that's why every often I be loftin'
Of course the caution's important
But I just transported, now I'm resortin'
Guess my last resort was to

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Reks]
This that next day effect, when you recollect on yesterday's ills
Remorse, and mornin' after pills
Room spinnin', consume Henn and resume sinnin'
To the tomb of the dude Devin, what a job it is spendin'
45 days in the sky, gettin' away, never comin' down
Down, off that loud high cloud, nah
Chasin' everlastin' dollar signs half the time
In an unfamiliar zone, home away from home
I'm prime, prolific, after rhymin' for some undisclosed digits
Flow vintage as old St. Nicholas'
Drownin' out the toasters and the biscuits
Globe travelin', establishment of money masterin'
Witness, dynasty buildin' international, appealin' to the masses
Where winners and survivors raise glasses
Arrival of the Massachusetts chapters, and G.O.A.Ts
Hope to see you somewhere hangin' from the rafters
Word up

[Hook]
