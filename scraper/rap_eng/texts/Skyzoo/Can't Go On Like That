[Verse One: Torae]
Yo, fresh off the bottom of the block
Still on my grizzly cause the grind never stop
Still getting busy till the day I make it pop
Niggas got it locked but when I get it cracking it's gon' be that Ready Roc
Watch, listen and learn
Nigga been patient, been waiting for my turn
Nigga been fire try touching and get burned
That's a general warning to whom it my concern
Music has returned to the roots and the essence
Went from the star student to the dude teaching lessons
Me and Skyzoo in the groove it's a blessing
Backed by Snowgoons, nigga who wanna 'eff with?
Lose off the effort, yeah and check the method
When I put bars to beats, that's some next shit
Rest of y'all retreat, go 'head hit the exit
Lyrics was remiss but I'm here to prove it won't go wrong like this
Motherfucker

[Hook: Torae then Skyzoo] {x2}
"I can't go on like this"
So I put the pen to the paper
Push the joint properly and make sure it's major and look what I made ya

[Verse Two: Skyzoo]
My ink pen is still the same so if you feel a change
It's prolly because you listening how the difference range
It's either that or I'm signaling in a bigger lane
I say it's both, so getting it is a bigger claim
You get it, most don't but I don't feel that way
And if I do it's with a crown and a singer's range
The cut quota, grew up with cut throaters
Smelled it in a hall whenever they cut soda
Whoever set the bar that was left to jump over
I did that
But who would've knew you could jump lower
Now they paparazzi the flow and I don't fault 'em
If I was you then I would too so when I talk I might often
Try to go easy
They want me to repeat, I want to leave 'em alone but they need me
No dumbing down so in order to come around
You need a listeners approach to see what I'm pumping out
You get it?
