1st verse:
This shit is wicked on these mean streets, but all of my friends speak
Cause we all that we got til these ends meet
Middle finger the rest though, cause if we ain't grow from the jump
Then you relating is done
And whoever said the speakers was the easy way out, couldn't understand the mechanics
And these faggot ass industry folk, granted
9 to 5 is how you survive
But my moms had 2 jobs so for her, 9 to 5 was 5 to 9
My spirit broke, and my vision altered
Cause you kno how visions go, it's either pray to God or Shawn Corey
That's just being honest and that's what was before us
And fuck if it's worth the risk cuz that's just what we wanted
I'd break bread with my day ones and school neighbors
All the ones who wound up on the front of your newspaper
Shit is dangerous, money and power is changing us
Blood on the steeple, praying against d'evils

Verse 2:
We all wanted the spotlight
And even if we're innocent we're scared of the cop lights
The irony right?, we saw the same things vying for life
It was either find a Dominican or find us a mic
Thinking back when we first learned to make a decision
And the thought of having to live with that as long as we're living
It was like, a hand around my collar, saying to breathe
And every time I'd attempt it would clench until I gave in
I tried to hear me out but wasn't convinced
And playing GQ made Bishop's of some of my friends
Who could ever foresee
We used to live for the night and now I'm paranoid tonight is my signal to leave
All the years we were brother like
Saw each other's mothers as the mother type and now you want my mother's light
Well none of that is meant at all, so my call
Is to guard her from that misery and make it yours, d'evils

Verse 3:
My flesh nobody can test, my soul is possessed
With this beautiful mess called success, and I guess
I'm at a point where I do shit off the lonely
Like "stupid I know you know me and your whole word owe me, strip!"
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
And so my fans assume that I'm that fucking type
Low and behold I talk the shit that I know cause I know it
And my friends that's left are unloaders
And so, what all of this means
Is that they're ready to lick off if you should intervene
I can't be held accountable, d'evils keep me around dudes
That do whatever is needed for me to keep it how we seen it by the stoop
Don't test me, I never cower
But Ima brand so Paeso's will put you next to flowers
Do believe as a lesson learned for the less inclined
Raised as a Jehovah's Witness but might never get inside, d'evils
