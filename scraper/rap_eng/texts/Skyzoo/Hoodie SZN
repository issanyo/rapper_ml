[Verse 1]
All black draping, drawstrings hanging, 
Bet that it can cover me from all of that awaiting, 
Bet you that it covets me and wants to keep me sacred, 
Everything it does for me is all in correlation 
Of me draping that up over me and keeping what it came with, 
Know they're hand in hand and ain’t no way to separate it, 
Ain’t no room for separation, only room to fit inside it, 
Room enough to be who they assume you coincide with, 
Like pulling on the drawstrings and running up inside of 
Where it’s at like “where it at?!” and leaving out with that beside us, 
Or pulling on the drawstrings to run from who behind us 
Til we happen to be back to where we had to need reminding, 
Remind us of the shit you was taught and still agree with, 
And how you can’t forget what you thought but never seen it, 
And if you did see what you thought, you couldn’t leave it, 
It turned everything that you saw into a sequence, 
Similar but different and all like it’s a remix, 
But bet you that hoodie is with me through any season, 
Bet it holds me over if somebody's rolling over 
Saying that I look familiar but they needed to see me closer, 
Bet you that it got me if they got me in they’re line 
With an infrared light show following behind, 
Bet you it got me covered if we talking about coverage 
And debating on the light that should be thrown up at the subject 
If the light that was behind me carried out on what it wanted 
And turned bright enough to blind out any discussion, 
On how it should all be blamed on this draping that we covet, 
Keep it all sacred my cape be on out in public, 
Cause it could never harm me, it just takes away what does 
And then replaces it with all that they would say I never was, 
It takes what they believed and leaves them to second guess it, 
To where they wanna be it and see if they can reflect it, 
Bet you that it’s with me if I’m fighting for a city 
That’s electing to align with whoever’s up against me 
And they’re looking at my kind as a reason to forget me 
And I’m moving like it’s fine for everyone who defends me, 
I bet you that it got me when 12 is driving by me 
And wondering if I’m low enough for them to hide me, 
And it got me if I need it to describe my intentions 
And it’s loyal to the point where it defines who I been with, 
And it got me if I need it to perform when they reaching, 
If they catch me then I know this cape on me if I’m leaking, 
It’ll catch whatever’s pouring to the floor before I see it, 
And it’ll be the reason your applause runs the deepest, 
And it’ll catch whatever might pour from your peoples, 
Leaning on the top of it, 
Face on the shoulder of it, looking for the obvious, 
Pushing for a reason tryna seek to where the bottom is, 
Swear it ain’t no stopping it, 
All black draping, drawstrings hanging, 
Bet that it can cover me from all of that awaiting, 
Bet you that it covets me and wants to keep me sacred, 
Everything it does for me is all in correlation, 
All black draping, drawstrings hanging, 
Bet that it can cover me from all of that awaiting, 
Bet you that it covets me and wants to keep me sacred, 
Everything it does for me is all in correlation 

[Chorus]
Bet you that it’ll protect you 
The way it protects me 
And it won’t let you ever forget me, 
It won’t let you ever regret me 
No it won’t 
Bet you that it’ll protect you 
The way it protects me 
And it won’t let you ever forget me, 
It won’t let you ever regret me 
No it won’t
