[Verse 1: Skyzoo + sample]
Enough room on the bench to sit us all, 
And based on the view where you sit, you pick a door, 
Waiting there que up your end like in a song, 
It plays out the roof of that Benz like this is yours
This is yours right? ("It's yours!") forever and then a day, 
Leaning on it while you picture your destiny with a stray, 
Given time, spending time with destiny in the way, 
Finish time, finish lines is everything they proclaimed, 
I proclaim, that we was in line for it, 
Visionary riches baby, we got the eyes for it, 
Caught up in the trace should you leave your design on it, 
You look at your name like you should be down to die for it, 
Or live a little, spill a little and represent, 
Deal with a bottle the way you deal with the decadence, 
Or deal with a hollow the way you deal with the negligence, 
Like "you get in the know, or deal with the reload,”
The feeling been the same since you filling in that role 
But still what a day 

[Hook: Saba Abraha]
What a day at the park
What a day at the park

[Verse 2] 
It was a dreary day 
'Til I stepped out 
Ice cream trucks passing us all 
Red ballon I'll follow you 
Till the night comes back around again 
Comes back around again
As I think to myself—

[Hook]
—what a day at the park
What a day at the park

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
Said to make owning a roof part of a habit, 
But learned that sitting in rooms that didn't have 'em, 
Heard that as getting your roof was all that mattered, 
All that to lift off the roof, could you imagine, 
The irony of the top being behind you, 
Be it the roof or the proof of who defied you, 
Or keeping your roof how you knew so that it hides you, 
Or see the recoup turn to coupes and it reminds you
That killing the roof, make it easier to hear who applaud, 
Whether it's "bravo yall" or airing at your car, 
Whether it's "bravo yall", staring at your arms 
And how they can fit up under, how to live up the summer, 
The park and how it does us, is credit achieved, 
Same 456ing over Peddler Themes, 
Same view of intuition you was led to believe, 
Same shooters in position if you ever do need, 
And the feeling been the same since you been in that seat 
But what a day

[Hook: Saba Abraha + sample]
What a day at the park
What a day at the park
("—ark")

"What a day at the park"
"What a day at the park"

[Outro: Sample]
"Well! This calls for a celebration!
Yes, sir. 
Let's have some Kool-Aid!
Alright."
