The way his lips parted to sound my name 
Felt like song and dance
He was a musical without the accolades
I hung on every note
We performed together nightly
Starting with interludes on my jawline
He left pitches in the pit of my throat
Never did he choke on the words "I love you"
He said it with his fingertips on my piano keys of a back 
He had a stroke not out of tune 
He knew the lyrics to the song before they were written
Our set was in production 
We could see our nomination for the "greatest love story ever performed” 
Strum these pains with your fingers
Let it hurt a little 
I want to be in sync and sink in all that you are in all that I am
I don't want amnesty
Jailbird me
Bar me inside your rib cage
So I can rest and lie where all your secrets and desires do
To study you
Lively... nothing can make you feel more awake and dreaming than when our skin fills one another with each other's essence
We breathe 
You are a hallucinogen and I have on a gas mask
Inhale you until I can taste you like I haven't eaten all day
You satisfy a physiological need
I thought I was complete 
I didn't realize how half I was until I found you
See you make me write love poems for days
Sex poems at night 
Hate poems in the morning 
Laughter in the afternoon
And It isn't that we love
It's how we love
Little time to the human clock, but we make seconds tick like hours 
Condemn me to a lifetime of our musical
So, we can sing and dance when your lips part and sound my name
I can't remember the rest…
