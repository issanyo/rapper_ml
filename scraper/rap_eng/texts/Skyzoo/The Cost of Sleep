[Hook]
For the cost of sleep
And what it cost to sleep
And should you ever doze
You doze cautiously
For the cost of sleep
And what it cost to sleep
The commas in the price tag
They talk to me
For the cost of sleep
And what it cost to sleep
Should you ever doze
You doze cautiously
For the cost of sleep
And what it cost to sleep
Long as you never know
You know all you need

[Verse 1]
And knowing alone is for the low and behold
Low and behold I'm still the soul of the hole
But losing mine to be it, losing eyes to see it
Vision better but who am I to believe it
So losing mine to be it, losing eyes to see it
But its whatever if you decide on sleeping
True as Posturepedics, and laying there, listening
The same shit that drove Rich & them
Dvd stars off of fam going missing and
We just see the odds open handed, gripping them, vice city
See we involved from the entrance and
DWI in the car but I'm good on my intentions till them lights get me
So pay me now, pay me later, and for yesterday
Mite nod a little, but I was never late
Hurry up and buy, like you ain't never wait, you lay down and you levitate
See if the twin mattress could talk the songs that it would harmonize
All the living I was living for the non alive
All the bitches that was in it wit they heart in mind
And all the women that was missing when my heart arrived
Pardon I, I was just was on a high
Peddler theme music but now I just wanna ride
And painting it for the Bose
You prayed that they car wasn't halted, and now you just praying that they don't doze

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Publishing checks and letters from jail
Come to me at the same time, that's my regular mail
Honest, they say the cost of success could weigh out your living
But what it cost for that rest will pay out the difference
And what we on is to the left, made to be different
If we was wrong from the get we'll stay to revisit
Now sing a song for the rep but change up the endings
Cuz we put on to the death, may he forgive us
For everything that we can count on
The overall is getting my amount on
Something I can mount on and say that this was worth it
If I should ever doze it just brings me down to perfect
Cause me I'm never faded, I made it where he made it
Hope it don't end the same but we get the same payment
Hope that I get my name scripted in the same cadence
Know I be in my ways but I feel like I'm the greatest
At least among these new mu'fuckas that was born in the 80's and better
Called it Dickensian when I got to playing wit letters
Call up Larenz and them and tell them that tape is forever
But what its 'bout is everything that you doubt
Applause for the 2 doors and the keys for the entry
And please y'all please don't tempt me
Leave me in this corner wit these stanzas alone
You figure this out, you'll see I stand on my own, receipts in the bag

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Me I'm never faded, I made it where he made it
Hope it don't end the same but we get the same payment
Hope that I get my name scripted in the same cadence
Know I be in my ways but I feel like I'm the greatest
