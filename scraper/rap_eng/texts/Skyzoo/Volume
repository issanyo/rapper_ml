[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Volume on decibel 10
Cloud 9 was a ladder
Let me stop before I left 'em again
Make it easy
Throw the nob to the right
And keep the speaker tuned
I gladiate with the bass we both beastin' through
Reality based, so anything I happen to say
Believe that like if it happened today
The seat back and I'm detracting the claims before they go to light
You know what the flower likes and you know we don't flow alike
Fuck is all the holding like?
Sky has been free
Ain't nobody lift me and you humbly envy
As long as the stay is humble, you good where you sit B
But the minute it get to me, is the minute your shit cease
Footprints in the wind, see I don't stand around
Sixteen at the end, like when the candle out
I'm Mariano when it comes to the clothes
Farigamo when it come to the clothes
You want a hand me down don't you?

[Verse 2: Sha Stimuli]
They call me S.T.I.M
Who, how, why him?
They lose, I win
Watch me slide in
Five, ten, $15,000 on my side and
Countin', I've been flippin' and bouncin' since I was 5'10"
Better yet, five or ten
Years old, rare soul music I deliver, you shiver
It's hard to bare cold facts like the best ever
The rest never had a chance, I am just clever
It gets better
Trendsetter and my interviews are better than your CD
And girls Youtube me just so they can see me
Dude told me watch what I say, this shit's on TV
My vocals so clear it's like HD in 3D
But my CD is easy y'all
And I don't need the slow Jeezy drawl
I still kill from Brooklyn
To Cali, you can tell I get love
Yo Stimuli is a helluva drug

[Verse 3: Donny Goines]
Musical masterpieces whenever I rap in speeches
The track unleashes the metaphors I attach in sequence
Why facetious or arrogant homie? That's a weakness
But I'm immortal on records, they can't surpass my genius
Raps ? secret society
Only members allowed in, you see in beside of we
Through the speakers admire me, recite the verses
When I write in cursive I'm quite the wordsmith
It's no argument, goin' against the Parliament
No pardon or leniency, mercy from the court we harmin' 'em
Put fear of God in 'em
Now we takin' over regarding none
Your bars ain't hard enough to ever think you can spar with us
Three the hard way
S.K. and Stimuli
My esses and niggas ride with chest plates that's filled with pride
And yes they will pay no mind
And us greats consider why
We all makin' real music, press play and listen ha
