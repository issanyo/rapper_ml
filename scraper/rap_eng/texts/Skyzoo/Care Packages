[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Dear numbers that replaced all the lit summers
Wings on the money made y'all uplift from us
And I'm throwing my Louis wallet into the lockers
And looking for quarters to get the key before I miss my number
Peep the 20/20 reach on me to see y'all thru
Transition VIP to V.I rooms
Shoot a flick, shoot a kite, shit indeed I do
'cause let whoever tell it, this could've been me or you
The same targets, the same agenda, the same markets
The same doe or die conversing around the park bench
Same bottle service and telling them keep the sparklers
Attention's overrated and now they get why we off it
Half a hundred thrown on the phone to let the call play
3 way with you and your woman so y'all bond straight
Crew love until the crew done
Until we upstairs talking 'bout how the crew won

[Hook: Skyzoo]
You said ayo Sky, I need a favor
If you can bring a couple pieces on your way up
It's 20 outside, some hoodies would be flavor
Lil care package, you know they tryna play us
You said ayo Sky, I need a favor
If you can bring a couple pieces on your way up
Know it's all love, all for the crew yo
Know it's all love, all for the crew yo

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Reciting "one love" back and forth and the genius within it
Til now I'm drawing up the same like yo this remix hitting
And the fact that a rendition is so easy to pen
Is a testament to the loop we all seem to fit in
It's like a cycle, some will come home, some will go in
Do a bullet, come back, and do the same shit, basics
Green carpet will lay a trail to get to chasing
And how living arrangements turn to sitting in arraignments
Pullover hoodies and "soul on ice" in paperback
Make it thru the walls, no shaking that
Couple black men's mags with Tammy Rivera on the front
'cause I mean, if it was me, those the pictures I would want
But fuck it tho, blow thru time, right thru the runnings
And treat the bid like Paul Cicero, light on the onions
Crew love until the crew done
Until we upstairs talking 'bout how the crew won

[Hook: Skyzoo]
You said ayo Sky, I need a favor
If you can bring a couple pieces on your way up
It's 20 outside, some hoodies would be flavor
Lil care package, you know they tryna play us
You said ayo Sky, I need a favor
If you can bring a couple pieces on your way up
Know it's all love, all for the crew yo
Know it's all love, all for the crew yo
I'm already on it
