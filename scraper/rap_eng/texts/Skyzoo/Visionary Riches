[Intro: Skyzoo]
I sees you yo
Bet that I sees you yo
I sees you yo
Visionary Riches
Bet that I sees you yo

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
I sees you, bet that I sees you
Swear I caught the vision when nobody believed you
So I had to see you, I came thru to see you
I just wanna kick it some shit I won't keep you
All that you want right? It hit like diesel
It get ahold of you and it refuses to leave you
But then when your palm itch, and you cash all in
That's me on the call in, I told you I sees you
My vision exact so if you get to react
Know the difference in that is they don't get where you at
But see I get where you at, so I wait at the door
So ambition won't pretend to save the day anymore
By any more of any means let that feeling breathe
You look for your desires well, I'm where the ceiling be
And I got time to hook you like you're tied off
I'm like pandemic if you got time for it

[Hook: Skyzoo]
Visionary riches, visionary riches
If God is your witness then may God forgive us
Or may God forgive you for being indifferent
All I did was swing thru to feed your addiction
And there wasn't a moment there that I didn't listen
And you talking that dream shit, I gave you position
And whenever you dreaming, I keep up your vision
And now all that I need is to be what you envision

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Admit you never felt more alive than riding shotgun
On your way to the lot with a lil shoebox love
And pulling off in a coupe of your own
Due to your own feeding of your desires all truthfully shown
Like never mind dealing with the dealers ever again
Word to the box that your white and red 11s was in
You turned the box into a vault and now you're parking by the court
Blueprint track 4, with one of those on your right
Fast forward the light, you know you low on your sights
But shit the dopest feeling you could ever hold in your life
Is that there, and the stares that come along
It turns into a high 'bout as clear as the drummer song
And now you gotta feed it, now you gotta feed it
Standing ovation, encore proceeding
Fuck what they be talking, just listen to the speakers
Never steer you wrong, just let me do the leading

[Hook: Skyzoo]
Visionary riches, visionary riches
If God is your witness then may God forgive us
Or may God forgive you for being indifferent
All I did was swing thru to feed your addiction
And there wasn't a moment there that I didn't listen
And you talking that dream shit, I gave you position
And whenever you dreaming, I keep up your vision
And now all that I need is to be what you envision

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
Visionnary riches, and never would I judge you
Said that I would stay close but never said I loved you
I mean you love me right ? That's enough for both of us
Never said for you to let your trust go and open up
But you never could hear me, you just played the receiver
Funny how the greed can y'all turn into the grievers
And I'm a streetcar named desire in the color that you wanted and a serenade humming thru your speakers

[Hook: Skyzoo]
Visionary riches, visionary riches
If God is your witness then may God forgive us
Or may God forgive you for being indifferent
All I did was swing thru to feed your addiction
And there wasn't a moment there that I didn't listen
And you talking that dream shit, I gave you position
And whenever you dreaming, I keep up your vision
And now all that I need is to be what you envision

[Outro: Skyzoo]
Visionnary riches
I sees you yo
Bet that I sees you yo
