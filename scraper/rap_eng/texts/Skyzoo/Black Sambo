[Pre-Chorus]
How they said a little black Sambo could never fit a crown, 
Mama said now that you got it don't ever put it down, 
Mama I swear I swear I'll never put it down, 
They gonn' have to kill me first 'fore it ever hit the ground 

[Verse 1]
And if it ever hit the ground, 
Bet that I'm next to it off of catching me a round, 
The only way I could ever be beheaded from the crown 
They wanted me to ignore 'cause they said that it amounts 
To a door where allure is as heavenly as it sounds 
But the floor that you on could levitate off the ground 
And you off to the call of speculating on how 
You could want what you want but never get to surmount 
What you saw, to tell them what you saw, 
Is telling them you was willing to peddle to front, 
And being in front will put you ahead of who belongs 
Til you leaking up under who you could never prove wrong, 
You'll never prove them wrong, right? 

[Pre-Chorus]
How they said a little black Sambo could never fit a crown, 
Mama said now that you got it don't ever put it down, 
Mama I swear I swear I'll never put it down, 
They gonn' have to kill me first 'fore it ever hit the ground 

[Chorus]
They said I'm black sambo, 
Bright Bape hoodie by the lamp post, 
Umbrella up that I can't close, 
You try to corner me but I can't fold 
They said I'm black sambo, 
Bright Bape hoodie by the lamp post, 
Hands in the air but my hands closed 
Is my instinct if you stand close, how close? 


[Verse 2]
Close enough where a name 
Can fully be re-cited if I'm ever on a stage 
With a judge pre-siding over everything that changed 
When 12 was replying to an image that was saved 
Of looking to creep by him with a desi’ on the waist 
Or wanting a seat by him while you stepping out the way, 
You take up the seat by him and he guessing why you came, 
He think that he seems fine but he left it on his face, 
And his face?, same one he giving you now, 
Remember you close enough where you can single him out, 
He know that you know low enough to know what limits allow, 
So believe him to open up and close your memory out, 
Like such, lights up, all eyes like the coke price cut, 
Whole time it'll throw a slight rush, 
All rise like loading up the pump, 
And you'll never prove them wrong, right? 

[Pre-Chorus]
How they said a little black Sambo could never fit a crown, 
Mama said now that you got it don't ever put it down, 
Mama I swear I swear I'll never put it down, 
They gonn' have to kill me first 'fore it ever hit the ground 

[Chorus]
They said I'm black sambo, 
Bright Bape hoodie by the lamp post, 
Umbrella up that I can't close, 
You try to corner me but I can't fold 
They said I'm black sambo, 
Bright Bape hoodie by the lamp post, 
Hands in the air but my hands closed 
Is my instinct if you stand close, how close? 

[Verse 3]
Too close for a loop hole to be the reason why you go 
To the hole where the loop froze, 
And then it repeats, and then you hoping that the loop broke, 
And the truth go, stretched out like Manute Bol, 
They press y'all like suit clothes, and them suit clothes, 
Couldn't save you from the type of stereo 
That they're willing to shoot fo', and the loop hole, 
Turns blacker than the light 
That they had you under when they handed you a mic 
And they asked you whether you was acting outta fright 
When they asked you if you was out trafficking tonite, 
Then they're at you with an automatic outta rights, 
Facebook Live panorama with your life, 
And that view goes from the cameras to the lights 
Til they tell son that he had every right, 
You’ll never prove them wrong, right?

[Pre-Chorus]
How they said a little black Sambo could never fit a crown, 
Mama said now that you got it don't ever put it down, 
Mama I swear I swear I'll never put it down, 
They gonn' have to kill me first 'fore it ever hit the ground 

[Chorus 2X]
They said I'm black sambo, 
Bright Bape hoodie by the lamp post, 
Umbrella up that I can't close, 
You try to corner me but I can't fold 
Black sambo, sambo 
Bright Bape hoodie by the lamp post, 
Hands in the air but my hands closed 
Is my instinct if you stand close, how close?
