[Hook]
Not much to gain or
It's those traveling in the sparks
Daily life what makes me forget my wounded heart
Not much to gain or ?
Daily life what's makes me forget my wounded heart

[Verse 1: Thurz]
Long days and long nights
Working the wee hours until the sunrise
Sunlight bring me home
Girl that's calling my phone, like "nigga don't have my daughter late to school no more"
I kiss her on the cheek and wish her well
That dream is what I sell, that the car, house and dog is in the mail
Fine man's ? and ambition that won't fail
With a down payment that can't be weighed on a scale
A heavy heart that's bleeding all over the canvas
Heart, courage and brains somehow it ain't in Kansas
Dorothy clicking heels but we far from home
Somehow I'm passporting to a continent, airplane mode, on that phone
Jamming a rough cut of that ? we hope to change our shoes
Living and such, that whole livelihood, doing better than good
A few planets from rock bottom, my nigga knew he could
Nigga Thurz

[Verse 2: Los]
Let's get rich what
Luccini falling from the sky
You see me I'm Jordan before he was balling for the Chi
That's Carolina how dare you compare a mine to mine
When I carry lines these these heroines jock me because I'm fly
I'm groovy, groupies gotta love my style
I'm coolin, my Gucci visor is upside down
Don't lose me foot on the peddle push through the ghetto, my hood, I'm good
Some of these niggas pull strings like Gepetto
I would advise you to seek council
Advise us reroute from the liars or be doused in a fire
As the loot go, new flow, cups of liquor and the juice gold
You go and a new ?, I loop the block and get a new ho
Too grown, new whip
Two tone, new bitch
New kicks, too cold
I do this, let's move on
Crew full, bills ten-fold
Here's a little info -- you niggas slow down and catch the tempo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
One time like
Make sure they hear me loud enough where even if I be whispering they can picture it
Or recite what it be if you ever need them to mirror it
And as right as it be if it's left to me to be steering it
I'm four lefts from the door steps of where y'all squaring it
My sincerest of pardons when I be chucking these
Shit I'm new in town and these muthafuckas was chucking me
Missed the shoot around so they underestimating what was under me
Til I'm Louis belting their legs, meaning I buckle knees
I talked what I know be it, metaphors and a flow
So if it's Louis belts then it's Louis belts on all of these hoes
Breathe a little, we made it farther than most
And we don't get to do this often but may we all get to gloat
May the women we around forever wanna be down
May they love Rap Genius and whenever you wanna be loud
May they love a good heel and letting something peek it
In detail all of the whispers I speak about
