Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
Follow that, no apologies for the tone of the holla back
But all we tryin to see is a openin out of that
Fuck the out of reach, I'm goin around the back
Need a role model, tell 'em role model that
I speak upon it and see I ain't runnin out of raps
Pray that if you follow, you take the horror up out of that
Take it for what it be, take it for what you need
Plannin on what you see, say it and let it breathe
Serenade on the beat and serenade me at the same
I give 'em me, so if it's me that they blame
They aye, no shame (no shame), huh, no sir (no sir)
Just rubber bands around the shit we concur
(Just rubber bands around the shit we concur)
Rubber bands around the shit that we earn
Get enough rubber bands and everything is a blur
But without enough of 'em everything we prefer
Is a mirage, so I need garages now, ya heard, huh?

[Hook - Skyzoo]
Heart made of metal, shoulders made of stone
I talk through the echoes and throw away the hope
Another day, another dollar, go for what I know
Another day, another dollar, I go until it's gone

Tell 'em heart made of metal, shoulders made of stone
I talk through the echoes and throw away the hope
Another day, another dollar, go for what I know
Another day, another dollar, I go until it's gone

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
And now it seems, all the money possibilities surroundin me
Is addin up to everywhere that I'm about to be
Some of the most heinous but the whole aim is
To be the one and done, never have to go gain it
So yeah I'm gon' gain it and be around to see it
Convey the stresses to every section of crowd that's seated
Stoop dreams and splittin a two piece
And pointin at better cars and learnin to loop beats
Mask on, my emotions is velcroed
I'm past gone but the only one that can tell so
So I tuck it, ain't no reason to up it
Reachin above the oven and see the dreams in the cupboard
Pay 'em no never mind or see 'em and get to runnin
Either to 'em or from it, intuition is jumpin
About as bright as the lights that you measurin under
Loud as the sound of the pound sittin next to the covers, I tell 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Skyzoo]
Yeah, celebrate for the way that we levitate
Huh, I never wait, tell 'em to get it straight
But I know that when I move, the eyes that's on me
Are the eyes that I cherish most, so I'm tryin to be all clean
But I be doin the most and hope they ignore the lead
But if they don't, I'm guilty as charged, it's all me
Still I, celebrate for the way that we levitate
Huh, I never wait, tell 'em to get it straight, got

[Hook]

Yeah
