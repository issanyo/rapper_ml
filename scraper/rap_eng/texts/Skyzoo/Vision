Intro [Will Boy]
Yeah, Will Boy, Down East Music Group, what up
Chorus [Will Boy & Skyzoo]
Rise for the risen, high enough to visit, point blank aim do or die for a vision, point blank aim do or die for a vision, seeing is believing if you spot it then you get it
Verse 1 [Will Boy]
Sitting back with a pack of raps that I kick lonely
Overdue for pay so alimony
Suggest I suck breast for success the black milk produced can keep my flakes so frosted like Tony
With the eye of a tiger you admire teeth like briars
With bars that’s fire like no chance of being hired
The skill of Will to keep it going like a liar to give you words from tv screens like Joyce Meyer
Say nothing like Michael Meyers
Recycle your trifle fires I blast like a rifle fire  detour your tour and share the road
Never bluffing oh this loving made me blue
Lost loved ones for nothing temptations made me rough and
Up and to the point to where my mama steady fussing
Being mushy so I gave her a kiss and left the stuffing
This that flow that may relate to your cousins
That can walk with your granny and tell stories like a nanny
You bunched up with your panties my future golden like Grammys
Til I’m holding one in my possession from the sessions of me
Rocking the mic now that’s what I call crush and run
Say a prayer at night thank God for Will and brush your gums
Chorus 2x
Verse 2 [Skyzoo]
They’ll take me alive never, wait til the time catch up, way they define pressure’s the way I define pleasure, pause, simply meaning I made it beyond measure, and it’ll take more than waiting to find a let up
I let up to find the set up then set up on my regretters, greet em and dedicate the meetings to my forevers, forever now aligned to be seated beside the headers, speaking for a spot and I’m speaking with my compressor
Loud enough for the lead out, bright enough for the seek out, you put your legacy on the line until something leap out, whether it’s extendeds or leveling your intentions, bet it’s more than needed to settle up on your entrance
‘Cause there wasn’t an entrance alluded to when I started moving through, they told me to shoot it thru, so I started shooting through, like fuck who ain’t movable, I’m caught in a shooters groove, I did this for you and you
Now look where we sitting, look at how we positioned, know when I get to ripping it’s like supply out the kitchen, like a zip and a dream sitting behind all the dishes, it’ll turn out serene like you admiring visions, you see it all
Chorus 2x
