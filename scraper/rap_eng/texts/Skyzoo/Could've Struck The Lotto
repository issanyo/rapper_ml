[Verse 1]
Killin' your idols one word at a time
When I was killin y'alls, I was also murderin' mine
Indeed I'm all it be, I squeeze accordingly
If a fave should get caught in between then all it means
Is meaning was never enough for me to wanna wish through
Fists full of dollars, ignorance is so blissful
Every part of me just wanna see how much the fists do
If this be a problem then I'm missing all the signals
You could miss me with the mistakes
Cause my realities is the meaning of missed plates
Kitchen tables need decorating, I'm decorated
The china be there but all the feelings is misplaced
And this may lead to a decay of beautiful sorts
If I could race through all the traits and the beautiful Porsche
Then I'll erase through the change they refuse to restore
And pitfalls in the poetry, truthfully yours
And monologues at a dollar store, invited to ride along
Parental advisory, all of it is how you thought
All that we In Search Of is to Fly Or Die
So to have you Seeing Sounds that's inside the Sky
Is Nothing I suppose, so if I was alone
Then them sounds that you seeing is all that I really know

[Hook]
For the all in the mall
And the rush to follow
That buck that bought a bottle
Could've struck the lotto
Say I'm on what I'm on trying to jump tomorrow
And I bought that boy a bottle
Could've struck the lotto, honestly

[Verse 2]
So that's 300 tickets that we could be comin' in with
That spade shit is pricey but we in love with the livin'
We in love with the life, lust, the pursuit
Promise not to forget how to adjust to the stoop
But if I'm away from whatever is made from
Know that I betrayed none, forever remained one
Forever embedded in the better of days come
The header on page one, my sketch is a ? run
Tootin' my own horn'll level the page some
And then the level gets lowered and I refrain from
Pennin' what the norm does, everything the norm was
Should've been the past but the future's like the norm's son
Tryna plan B that, pills in the sauce
Hope they smart enough to eat that and dumb enough to starve
So to summarize it all, this is more than what it seems
Fully loaded clouds, corner of your dreams
It's nothing I suppose, so if I was alone
Then them sounds that you seeing is all that I really know

[Repeat Hook]
