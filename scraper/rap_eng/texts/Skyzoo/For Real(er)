[Verse 1]
Stop fucking around and be a man
You either can be stuck underground or flee the land
Like you can be the one in the ride who lead the band
Or you can be the one on the line who need a gram
Do it how they taught you on the records they brought you
Your hero said he'd run outta town on Peter Pans
Cool, all that resonates and all that dedicates til you outside and you see the vans
I rolls on the loop with everything we about
'cause circles can't fit no squares, it keeps em out
Looped in off what the stoop is
Where the pound talk is treys like Lupin
Un-markeds side by side where the coupe is
They c'est la vie the next Trayvon shooting
I'm back to my brick in the booth shit, my vocab paraphernalia
I float around the track like Mahalia
Back for the braillers, know that they drag you when you gone like you playing for Baylor
That's word to a Dennehy, and words to remember me
You know it's either that or you turn to a memory
You are who you are, you can't turn on your tendencies
Prove it when we call something over, ven aqui
Truck jewels while the truck move, caught it right off the deck
Til' they strip it and call it quality of life arrests

[Chorus]
It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer
It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer
It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer
It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer

[Verse 2]
They say it's like that, money entice that
The celebration is waiting like "where the lights at?"
I made a way out the gate and ain't have to hype that
I put my name on a plate and they couldn't price that
I seen cops get lower than where the night's at
I seen dice turn over and push a life back
I sent dough in the mail like where the kites at?
They make your bro switch cells before you write back
But shit it's like that, nothing else like this
Did it alone so I don't know what the hype is
And when it's like this and po-9 peruse by me
I treat em like if all of em think that they're Giuliani
Said they got a reason to see what the aim like
I trained with my left 'cause I knew they would play me right
7 days 7 nights while the 7 is upon us
Que up the God number like Melo in the corner
Taught us our fathers to the heavens that adorn us
Caught us star gazing at the bezels that was on us
Pat your own self on the shoulders
Or mask on, put your name up like Quinones
OG told us how he blew dollars rights before the lick hit
Take 'em back, blue collar '94 Knicks shit, it's like that
Money entice that, the celebration is waiting like "where the likes at?"

[Chorus]
It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer
It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer
It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer
It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer
