[Verse 1]
Trying to be a Huxtable but predestined to be a Evans, see what luck can do?
If we was ever to see an exit, keep it wonderful
And leave out on good terms if it come to you
For what it does to you or if its worth it there
Charge it all to the game and leave your purchase there
Cause all we wanted was lanes so if we turning there
Know that we drove for as long as we could
Misunderstandings when all of us were so understood
Putting hands in, trying to get a hold of some goods
I mean, Nelly called is mother and told her quit her job
Fuck a 16, that shit was as real as God
And as I watched that diary on Cornell
I became a fan for how he changed the doorbell
Buzzers get replaced so fuck you feel away
I'm just trying to do that all so give me love or give me lane

[Hook]
Be Well (x4)
I just hope you be well
Well enough to know where we at
One of one, and I just hope you see that
And I just hope you
Be Well (x4)
I just hope you be well
Well enough to know who we are
We were dreaming long enough now that sleep shit is gone
So be well

[Verse 2]
Introspective street rap I birthed that
I carried that flag when y'all were trying to 'herse that
Now this shit is moving and its proving that you can work that
Do remember where they learned that
Hope you be well
Well enough to know the dope from the jail
And the shit they try to give you when they throw you a cell
Cause all I ever tried to give you was all pure
I ain't gon' step on anything it was all yours
I was trying to paint a couple pictures in the living room
Using cardboard as a canvas like 'this will do'
And if I bid adieu
And these is worth something
And let my mother make a sell, so she could purch' something
And let my pops keep his favorite out the catalog
And if my block get to spraying, I ain't mad at all
Salute something, word to black Jesus on the wall
If not, then you won't see us anymore and I just hope you Be Well

[Hook]
