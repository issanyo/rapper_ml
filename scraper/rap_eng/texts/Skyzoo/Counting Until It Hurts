Tryna be counting until it hurts tho
Hash tag we keeping the money first flow
You work slow then you last as far as firsts go
Ivy league street raps I sorta birthed those
Never stepped foot on a step without my steps
Being in some sneakers that made you need to rewind yep
I was 18 in the dorms, getting pictures drawn
By the art majors of chains that I was spending on
Week later had that chain, went and hit the halls
Put it on your wiz while I tagged, I would christen broads
The perils of being young
Stair case wit a stripper I let her be who she want
Rewind to how I grew up, fast forward my new up
Caught in between corner dreams and hallelujahs
Waking up wit visions of credit card schemes
And then buying art with 'em off whoever lost these
The irony thats in that, where obviously I'm backed
By some guys that don't get it but got me if shit is packed
Shit changed, shit didn't
Show money on denim
The upscale vandals, the jeans they been Visvim
We was bound to be around what we around
So we roped off the circle from squares to keep 'em out
Spilling Spade on cool Greys
To your broad I'm Nas, to moms I'm Cool J
To your squad I'm the God, a product of two a days
And the closest to Shawn since the moment you knew Jay
At least that's what they put in their tweets
As well as the voices in front when I look up street
Said if we treat the last like it's the first
Only problem that we'll have is counting until it hurts
I mean, said if we treat the last like it's the first, only problem that we'll have is counting until it hurts
