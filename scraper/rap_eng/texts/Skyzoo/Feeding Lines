Back to it like a 3, rap to it like you need, pass through and follow lead
I got 'em playing the corner like they shooter's outta reach
You riding the baseline I can school you how to leap
Right, one more time, back to it like a 3, rap to it like you need
Pass through and follow lead
There's nothing that they can say that I ain't do I ain't breed
If I'm cutting em out the way then shit I'm grooming out the league
Really you kno me well, back scoop on how it be
My bitch is a Lore'l, rack truly out they league
Lyrically I couldn't really name another
Only ones that I could name ran wit Dame or run above us
Either way I lead the way to what you make and how you love it
Nothing new it's just everything that you knew
Before you realized you was inside of a bigger loop
I tied 'em all together with visions of getting coupes
Mine was all cash, I fit it beside the stoop
Kept it one in the same
I'm looking outta the rear
Like look who following here but I'm never one to complain
Let 'em covet the lane like I covet the walls
Put my name over names getting up in the halls
Put my name over names, double line double time
I give you the clock twice and let you find what you can find
I give 'em the spotlight and tell 'em rhyme youngin' rhyme
They looking back up to me like what's the line, what's the line?
Feeding lines like I wrote 'em the script
Might as well when you see how they approaching they shit
My approach is everything that I know, and everything it left you
I mean it goes how it goes, ill let my friends tell you
Music for 'em like fuck everybody else
If you fan then you a friend and you fucking wit how we felt
Setting up a parade in advance is the plan
Cause it's no way that we not winning, hand over hand
I mean, feeding lines like forever and a day
Talking music for my friends until everyone is paid
Feeding lines like forever and a day
Talking music for my friends until everyone is paid
