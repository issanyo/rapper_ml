Who wanna bet us that we don’t touch lettuce
Stack cheddar forever
No treachery till they get to us
Doing what’s best for us is far today
But tomorrow will be tomorrow and tomorrow can wait
We need it now, need a sound that we can borrow or chase
To be around when we around it’s solely honest to trees
And you call it how you see it, we call it awake
Till we ignore the law being all in our face
Shit, you all for the taste and we wanted the recipe
Learn it and burn it before they get to reach
You feel me? Jealousy and slandered eyes wanted to kill me
Or at least spoke like it but no one approached like it
So yeah, and they stressin’ the air reason for them
But it’s more soul, my Morse code build it with them
We talk law and wardrobe built for the win
And the win ‘cause confetti could fall at any event
Hopes tell you get in, dreams tell you to stay and wow
If it all should fall apart before you take a bow
Then may the day be living proof that you made away
My O1 was a Sean Carter 88
I’m all for presidents to represent me
I’m all for presidents to represent me
I’m all for presidents to represent me
I’m all for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I’m all for presidents to represent me
I’m all for presidents to represent me
I’m all for presidents to represent me
And it’s dead fucking presidents I’m tryna meet
I want money like Cosby, who wouldn’t?
Or at least Raven Symone the way Raven Symone was cooking
May have been wrong or I may have mistook it
But my attention is to talk to you through song and sing how we looking
They showed us everything but looks deceive
They made a world of pain, a world where only crooks could breathe
Then they dare us to take a breath and they dare us to make a left
When the right after the lights is what they pushed beneath
You see? Shit I’m involved with got me pins and needles
‘Cause if this pin don’t push the needle where I need to it’ll be pens that bleed you
I’m here to tell, shorty, it ain’t all swell
There’s heaven then there’s hell to catch you when you fell, shorty
We all fall, it’s just about where we landing, they heroes on all fours like they forgot how to stand
The ones who stood all be the ones that raised us
Forgive us for being stubborn, the industry couldn’t change us
And well, if that should hinder us, I’m tryna get the digit up
And we’ll just take it back to what we know and what the ceiling does
Conflicts correspondent with my enemy, representing infinity for presidencies
You know
I’m all for presidents to represent me
I’m all for presidents to represent me
I’m all for presidents to represent me
I’m all for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I’m all for presidents to represent me
I’m all for presidents to represent me
I’m all for presidents to represent me
And it’s dead fucking presidents I’m tryna meet
