[Verse 1]
Swear the only thing that I wanted
Was for you to know that I did it like nobody done it
Then say I did it again and did it a third time
And know that the third time was the trinity coming
Coming up from a section where everyone is gunning for the exit
Until it's roped off like heroin
Can't say they caught me on the ropes
Nor can they ever say they talked me into hope
My hope was tucked under my know how, know how?
Made it the way I know, PLO style
So one time for the Method I chose
And if you tied those together then I'm guessing you home
And home is same kind that I grew up all around
Still uniformed down so I'm never alone, nah
But shit it felt like it on my entry
So counting takes forever, you dig me?, falling out the sky

[Hook]
Saw money falling out the sky
Reached up for it and just wanted a reply
Reached up for it and was caught up in the high
And then came down off the ride
Falling out the sky
Saw money falling out the sky
Reached up for it and just wanted a reply
Reached up for it and was caught up in the high
And then came down off the ride
Falling out the sky

[Verse 2]
One of one like a first born, out of the aim of the first drawn
Couple shoulders couldn't duck it, now my shoulders being covered
By them shoulders up above us like I work for 'em
Maybe I do, or rather I did, if I should bid adieu
The way it seems I've been signaled to move
Never moved like the rest, had to whip on my own
Couldn't move like the rest, I got mirrors at home, I'm sorry
Built on integrity first and the motto to get the money was the 2nd we learned
When you are who you are then your part don't change
And my name really my name like I'm Marlo made, and yet
The most doubted was the most about it
And he put it up where you could pull the most up out it, and yet
I tell 'em be that as it may, forgive me for leaving with my name
While they're falling out the sky

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
So if this is the last thing that you hear
Take to it how it is same way it appears
Take to it how it is same way that it was
And know that what we was looking at became a mirage
But still, regardless of the way it concur
For the Flip, just know they can't erase what we were, right?
Couple dreams that were cushioned by the bread
I broke mine to know that we fed, falling out the sky
