[Intro]
Yea
It goes 1 for you
1 for me
2 for you
1-2 for me
You know how the rest go
Mad because I know that cash rules

[Hook: Skyzoo]
Flash jewels
How they mad because I know that cash rules
Everything around me
Never let me down see
Never did
Tell em' to forever get from round me
If they ain't bout a win
Okay
Flash jewels
How they mad because I know that cash rules
Everything around me
Never let me down see
Never did
Tell em' to forever get from round me
If they ain't countin' in

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Okay
Flash jewels
How they mad cause I know that the cash rules
We grew up on that tune
And you know me and that groove
I will seat it for what it gave us
And took the wheel when they
Stopped believing that money made us
Cause till they pay us
I promise to make em' fuckin hate us
Love us later but pay us now and be done with favors
Olympians and black fistin'
How the running made us
And bar none so clearly they wanna running mate us
Campaign for this bread
So when they underplayed us
My jewelry on so you can't deny me on what they gave us
Coupe dreaming that turns into coupe's leaning
Like God
Play the odds and I promise they shooting evens
And the rims got us hurrying
Looking for 24's
Like the 14th and the 30th
Damn I threw that high
My bad
I'm in the zone where they stand and shoot ya ride
And push you out of your doors
And then plan ya suicide
Double meaning ha

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Torae]
Condominium dreams and Range Rover fantasies
Can't be realized if you under ya canopy
From youngin I planned to be
Everything ya optic viewing
The big man in the center
That never got the Ewing's
That's why I cop the new ones in twosomes and foursomes
Rock em' once then give em' to an orphan
Shit is awesome
They call it flossin
I call it paying forward
For all the days of food stamps
I had to pay the store with
Notorious Tor been on tour
I tore it for 20 thousand
Used to talk in front of my building nigga
Public housing
In the Republic of China
I'm out in Beijing browsing
Far from my Banana Republic styling
The moral value
What the Lord allow you
Is what you should show of
Cause these niggas you liking on Facebook will show you no love
And all I know of
Is how to act cool
Blast tools at wack dudes
Rapping that fast food
Sky school em

[Hook]
