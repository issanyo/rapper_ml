I'm a stranger in my own world
Darkness came down and took over

[Verse 1: Astro]
‘Cause from the outside, the game looks lovely
The women, the money, the cars, all this because of some bars?
Tours everywhere, it’s a miracle, lyrical skills pay the bills
Senseless chicks let you get some feels
Got your momma proud, let her see you rocking the crowds
After the standing ovations, you take a bow
You got it all now, people around you hyping
The only thing missing is excitement, damn
All that anticipation for the call but you could've waited
Private planes, you feeling lost on them trips to Vegas
In hotel rooms, momma dying like beans for some sugar from you
But you got an album to sell soon, your stress at an all-time high
No insulin still, you gotta pay your career that you've been living with
Envisioned it when you was living with rats and roaches
Now you got it but don’t know how to approach it
Associates is only around for good moments
The checks in, they bring yes men and you know it
Wanted to get behind the curtains, they finally let you go
Only for you to realize the show is just a show
And everything's set up by the stage guys
When the executioner arrive, they apologize
Boos and boos, what happened, you mastered in rapping
This supposed to be your thing, you were supposed to be the king
You did it on the corner with your homies, it was natural
Should've took the weight off your shoulder but it’s a sad show
All you got is talent, thought spitting real made you a star
But ain't prepared for the extra molecular
The love is dead, son, you got sixteens
Depended on the pen and the paper to get you the cream
Wanted to shine through your lines but the business is danger
And in today’s game, the real MC is just a stranger

[Hook: Astro]
‘Cause all I really need is the microphone
And a dope beat, but, will that get me home? (a yo)
I don’t know man, I don’t know man, I don’t know man
I don’t know, I don’t know
‘Cause all I really know is the microphone
And the real beats, but, will that get me known? (a yo)
I don’t know man, I don’t know man, I don’t know man
I don’t know, I don’t know

[Verse 2:Skyzoo]
Enough time in the ring to know you bring more than they ever brought
So all of them better sing you praises when your flag get to waving in the wind
Standing tall for it all and know that you've never been
Dreams and ambitions and keeping your hands in it
And how you say what you say but it seems they can’t get it
Nice enough to be crowned as corner king
Living for the pen like all you know is you want a ring
And then it all comes down from afar and everything that you saw is nothing like what you thought
Truly yours, this whole shit’s a facade, they go and send you their odds, hope that it evens out
And if not, then pick a card, any card
With the lights and the fame that you might've saw
You knew, the dictators know nothing about what our corners do
Try to win by any means at any cost, I promise, you see a scene and you won’t fiend this any more
Not at all

[Hook: Astro]
‘Cause all I really need is the microphone
And a dope beat, but, will that get me home? (a yo)
I don’t know man, I don’t know man, I don’t know man
I don’t know, I don’t know
‘Cause all I really know is the microphone
And the real beats, but, will that get me known? (a yo)
I don’t know man, I don’t know man, I don’t know man
I don’t know, I don’t know
