[Verse 1]
If you can hear my stroll it'll sound like the snare on a roll
But I'm too cool to walk so my Cadillac hog
Get to gripping the corner and I'll be gone before you clear me to go
It'll be me, myself, and my Saturday night special
In a sea full of needles and habits that might bless you
I shape my fro and get back to the usual
Shit is Russian Roulette if I'm clappin' up through the crowd
Accurate with the *BLAOW* so fear no strays
Say, I aim where I aim on how I hear your rage
Vigilante, bred through dice games and tray bags
And cleaned up like the first day back
Tell 'em it's the D-Y-N-A-M-I-T
E on the closure, usually where the hoes were
Loose their furs like they loose they composure
And bring snow hills for the roof of where their nose was

[Hook]
Muthafucka I'm cool de la
Jive turkeys couldn't hurt me, but do they try
Tryna murk me on the early, but I'm too on time
I don't worry, I just move on by
Said, I'm cool de la

[Verse 2]
Wood grain whip appeal
You catch me and Bullhorn where all the bitches build
Secondary though, first up is hit the steel
Warehouse clears out right before the shipment peels
Another take down, hear they wanna get me killed
They're low until they get to me and then it get for real
They know that if it get to me I'm 38in' it
Hold these for trying to get away with it
Police is trying to get paid from it
That's paper bag money
But Cream Corn will get the scoop and lay the rap on me
Perhaps they was tryna trap on me
So Honey Bee is tryna clap for me
She get her Pam Grier on, hands clear on the stance we're on
And we got eyes all around us, so you can't stare long
Ha, right back like it never left us
I blow the spot and leave out of here with Thelma Evans
Dynamite

[Hook]
Muthafucka I'm cool de la
Jive turkeys couldn't hurt me, but do they try
Tryna murk me on the early, but I'm too on time
I don't worry, I just move on by
Said, I'm cool de la

[Outro]
Black Dynamite
Know what it is when I walk in there with it
You might know me as S-K-Y-Z-O-O, S-K-Y-Z-O-O
But call me Black Dynamite
