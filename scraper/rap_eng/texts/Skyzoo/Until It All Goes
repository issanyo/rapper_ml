[Intro]
Go
Yea
Til it all goes
Til it all goes
Til it all goes
Til it all goes
Okay

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
My cologne is Yves Saint Laurent
Each way to the part
Got a trail of it there
See I made it beyond
But I'm braille over there
See ya way through the dark
Like a rail over there
I lead the way and be gone
That be all
Did what I could
No steps to it
Kept it just the way it was when you get to it
None of it is altered
Wonder what to call it
Call it the exact baby
None of what they offered
Call it the react
Maybe all that you was wanting
Was wrapped underneath you
And that could at least do
The prove when you need it
And you wouldn't believe it
I was defining the word and shooting through the reason
I was provided the urge to use it how you see it
Blame it on the hindsight
Knew it then you keep it
Spoils to the victor
Draw em' out the picture
Know that the allure is a fixture
Until it all goes

[Hook]
Said that this was all that they all know
Everything they wants what they call fo'
Never know you gone til you almost
Puttin' somethin' on it til it all goes
Puttin' somethin' on it til it all goes
Puttin' somethin' on it til it all goes
Say you never know you gone til you almost
Puttin' somethin' on it til it all goes

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
The reality of
The heat of light
The back of the bulb
Hovering above
All that you was glad to become
Coverin' the snubs givin'
They're few and far between
Nothings unnoticed but true to all we be
We be on the other side
Heart of the view
And what you might've saw was the low part of the hue
The post pardum the stu
Sporadically raised
To win a way to display how it was craftily made
So say hello to the vivid
The dopest of the livin'
Who just be tryin' to live through the dope that he be kickin'
You never heard similar
Quote it if you different
Cause these mawfuckas wasn't dope enough to sniff it
Or let alone tie somethin'
Let em' go buy somethin'
Money spent the same and the stress of what the buys brung em'
All into one
Until it all goes
I'm regarded with one
I let it all show
Like

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Manhattan]
A million letters a hundred words ain't nothin' work
I put it on creative control and nothin' works
Another verse my Pulitzer Prize
Look at the bullets I dodged
Another scar I sook to mind
Look beyond what took LeBron
To newer heights then look behind
And see a duffle bag
It's fully of Nike money
He outta high school
Why study
I dropped out
Ain't life funny
Suddenly you lookin' down at the street
From a flight that just peeked
And all the lights look gray
It's a go homeboy
Screamin'"Oh my Lord"
From the top of ya lungs
Till you got no voice
The there ain't noise
Till there's ain't no Rose' left to be poured
Last call niggas
Ain't no one my friend now
My family just branched out
My chin up though
Look who I held down

[Hook]
