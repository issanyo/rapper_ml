[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
The revisited “The Don Cheadle Effect”
And the awards given off to the floor seats of the ‘jects
And them awards given off for seeing respect
To them all that’s involved that call me they connect
To the wall they was on the four seats of them steps
That’s beyond where that wall is drawing me to be next
So I talk what I talked and y’all seem to be left
They was lost and I crossed and all they see is a X
My honesty in a Tec in the hands of Ilena’s cousin
Yo mouth screaming to “duck”
While you be leaking from it
See all I be is the tuck, so if you keep me from it
They don’t need what they want or what they need is wanted
And wanting it lowered and trying talk them to know it
Cut the K and the W and maybe I shouldn’t throw this
Cut the K get a W I just toss them a notice
Let it play until it stuck and then you become the awoken

[Hook] (x2)
This is for the awake
Call it quarter to 8
Whatever they desired, I put it all on their plate
What ever I would scribe they take it all for the day
We on the same line as long as that line pays

[Verse 2: King Mez]
This for the awake, first viewing of the body
Before the funeral numero uno with the shotty
Who could part this
Thank you for your listening and under-standing
Reprimanding when you was up in ya lunches
Arguing with niggas on ya solo against bunches
About Nas when they ain’t understanding his punches
Pizza getting cold you ain’t worried cause these dunces
Never stomached the real, it’s terrible that they crunches
Homie I be kicking the real, like Brazil
Without the ‘Z’ giving people something to feel
On every 1st listen they never knew nothing as ill
Because I’m king, they be Bishop like they running with Steele
Uh, let me get ya bitch that be something to kill
While I maneuver through the game and I’m getting my bills
Over saturation of rappers but we giving them skills
Through the flood they see the real
Niggas spitting with gills

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
When the comforter is in the same fold
It was in when you first left hearing them same clothes
And in the end you’ll be tying together to make bose
Get wind of when riding along to the same tone
Shit dims, lights get lower than save modes
And them rims on the tires is wired with payroll
But then again, if you ain’t get to touch that bed
Then you caught when I was running when I said

[Hook] (x2)

This is for the awake…
