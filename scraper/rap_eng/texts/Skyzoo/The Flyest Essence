[Intro]
Gentlemen, gentlemen. Don't waste your time in the vain pursuit of this or that endeavour. Groove with the grape. For it is wiser to fly with the fruitful grape, than it is to be high, on hopes and illusions

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
The Flyest essence
Thrown within y'all direction
Jam video 7s and rovers with higher exits
Meaning the wheels lift up the flooring for higher stepping
I'm Albee square with the aura so if y'all should catch it
Then Al B. to swear any surer of y'all reflection
Without a youngin tryna deny any of my inflections
Lil handshake on the way in to stop the check in
And dealing with a pagan in Reagan who got the exits
Nino Brown on the beeper and Christopher Williams records
And bitches who find a weapon as quick as you find a guest list
Parked in front the shark bar hoping that y'all neglecting
But all this karat shit becomes louder than I expected
And dealing with Reggie shit when I'm court side
So I'm back at the shark bar, walker wear all tied
My soul roll taste like it was made with the Lord knives
And this bottle of wine from 85's on the tall side
And knowing all of that there, made us different from y'all acceptance
'cause those the guys we grew up around, so for y'all protection
These double entendres is purposely on the record
Cause the motives is off the record so know when you bought a record
That I'm just all about a baton going hand to hand
The motto still the same when we opened the panoram'
My feet on the table for my neighbors who had to stand
And I bring the wrangler so there's room in the truck to get Ashley Graham
My friends still the same, we was raised by the same icons They was throwing you lockjaw, I was throwing you krylon
We still sharing this hennessy privilege and playing "Flygod"
I was talking 'bout touring and they was talking 'bout firearms
They bumping Dilla on they way to get a bird flu
Never would've tied them together, but that's what words do
Apollo caught the loop like we waiting to get a turn thru
I told him leave the drums in the box, keep the nerds cool
Shit is good for me, I'm Cochise to the varsity, look at me
Look what it took of me
Look what was put to me
And look who looking up at all that we was cooking Gs
Look at that

[Outro]
