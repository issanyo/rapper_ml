[Intro: Skyzoo]
11 racks for a painting, said its kind of steep but the meaning it came with
Make it all worth it
Worth it to be paying
Cleaning off the mantle, living room waiting
The living room saying "we made it" of some sort
Running from whatever but know what we run for
Is to run this shit forever and hopefully want more
Expect me to keep this baton from off the floor

[Bridge: Skyzoo & Mayer Hawthorne] (x4)
They expect me to
Pick it up, pick it up
Get it

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Expected to carry the tradition on
Born in it and honestly couldn't wish for more
Applaud with it, promised I wouldn't miss a call
But torn in it so part of me wants to skip it all
All of it, all of this to live up to
And living from the past when you live as a Huxtable
If this is what you ask then give me my just do
Living off of that they was keeping us comfortable
For 300 thousand, yearly, brought up into the house
And clearly and all of this is my outcome
But clearly dyslexic, dumbing me down shit
I'm seeing letters backwards, numbers ain't rounding
For prom limos, renting out helicopters
Its all apparent like all of y'all better watch us
All I hear is they all got better options
And so to opt out at all was never options

[Hook: Skyzoo] (x2)
So for that painting on the wall
No matter what its worth, never have to take that off
Keep your last name living, your last name did it
All the way to the bank, take your last name with it
One time

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Worrisome until all of the worry's done
10 Stigwood Ave fam we worry none
You heard wrong if you believe that song, the worry comes
Every time I hear my last name on a worried tongue
We wanted the same living, fucked with the same women
But me and Cockroach wasn't cut from the same ribbon
So, salute to you cause me and mine was cornered in
Impossible sneakers to fill like we was Jordan kids
Or better yet they gave us a briefcase
And a stethoscope and the hope that you breathe straight
I hope that you be awake when it all goes
Late nights trying to bring this doctorate on home
Mentor to Stanley, I'm doctoring almost
Till they went and shot up son's car on the wrong road
Look like I'm a product of tomorrow, lord knows
I'm just trying to bottle up tomorrow and pour it slow
Never be enough though

[Hook] (x2)

[Outro: Skyzoo] (Bridge x4)
11 racks for a painting, said its kind of steep but the meaning it came with
Make it all worth it
Worth it to be paying
Cleaning off the mantle, living room waiting
Living room saying "we made it" if some saw it
Running from whatever but know what we run for
Is to run this shit forever and hopefully want more
And expect me to keep this baton from off the floor
They expect me to
