Verse 1:
I'm from where they throw it all from crack to opium
In 3rd person, so if you Tryna see them
Then it's a call to make a call before you meet them
And even that's asking a lot without a lead in
I know the whole situation like a read in
Metamorphic when it change what you believe in
Told us everything could be ours if we just leap in
But said I'm too tall for shallow walls and so the deep end
Is where I should be reaching
Know what it comes with but damn if I don't need this
To be the way they preached it, they sermon seem the sweetest
Presented with a couple lanes, a couple ties
To where I'm lacing up a convo, embracing on this drive
I'm in a place where my demise can be memories from the top
Or memories of a spot where my memories should've popped
And with that, remember me as the centerpiece of the top
How I inspired your faves, it's bittersweet when they drop
And with that, if I should leave and then team with their kind
How can I, ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets this time

Verse 2:
As sure as this, earth is turning, pockets burning
We living it how we learned it
Shoot for the moments they showed us and move like they owe us
My moms crying on the inside, trying
To hide what she might fear, my timing is light years
In front of me, and what I wanna reach, should be up under me
But all this dream shit is a mess, so I digress
And I confess what I feared forever
Given the seats to these thrones keeping these chairs together
Rightfully so, and so, if you find yourself reminiscing, remember this one
When he was here no one could go where his pen was
But this was, never the way that they said it would be at all
So I'll put my morals by my jersey when I leave the court
And hope the next rookie here, eyes with a rookie stare
Gets to see more than they showed me when I looked in there
Time waits for no man can't turn back the hands when it's too late
Gotta learn to live with regrets
