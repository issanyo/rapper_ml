[Verse One] [Skyzoo]:
Dear shawty wop
Instead of focusing on you I was focusing on gwap
Instead of calling you I was calling on the block
And then expected you to not wanna stop
You could of left this, but instead you stayed close and accepted all of my neglections
I was lookin' for hope
But these suit and ties was laughing at how we ride, they took us for a joke
And love I couldn't do that
They was turning us down, but the block had new jacks, it was bubbling wild
And honestly, that was way easier than this was
Till I stood there like, "Damn, I kinda miss her"
I went from kickin' it with you in the booth
To gettin' paid, but wondering who was with you
This shit is played, I jealous in the worst way
So hip hop, let's relive the first date
And start it over

[Hook] [Skyzoo]:
I know I put a lot before you
But I never intended to ignore you
Everything that I did was to support you
You the reason I live shawty is all you
So before I make the same mistake
Hip hop let's start it all over
Over
And before I make the same mistake
Hip hop let's start it all over
Over

[Verse Two] [Emilio Lopez]:
We never had it easy
We never had a moment to breathe
And all we wanted was a moment of peace
(That's right)
And cats is taunting you for rollin' with me
Your fam askin' what's wrong with you and couldn't get along with you
A couple argument's a couple of fights
They said we couldn't be a couple just because I was white
Or because I wasn't hustlin' and thuggin' at night
They fronted like I wasn't fuckin' you right
We made love though
But in the club they grillin' me cause you feelin' me
Wishin' they was ill as me
(Why?)
Cause you still with me
I heard 'em whisperin' like, "Why could it be?"
So they kept me on my toes like I'm tryin' to see
Keep my head above the Jones I'm better with the flows
We got nothin' to hide, let's express it in the open
Got nothin' but pride for developing the closeness
With, hip hop so accept it or get over it

[Hook] [Skyzoo]:
I know I put a lot before you
But I never intended to ignore you
Everything that I did was to support you
You the reason I live shawty is all you
So before I make the same mistake
Hip hop let's start it all over
Over
And before I make the same mistake
Hip hop let's start it all over
Over
