[Verse]
As soon as the drum rolls I’m picturing unloads
I’m picturing one show that gives them an unclosed
Description of one grown, and witnessing son grown
“That boy good, and to the greats, he the one chose”
As soon as the horns lift, I picture the cautious
Becoming beyond it from fear of the lost sense
I’m picturing all them that said he was awesome
Retracting their talking for fear an endorsement
May seal up their coffin, hammer to the nail
Metal to metal but he’s just planning to prevail
Ghetto to ghetto they say he handle what they rail
Echo the echoes, and if he handle what they rail
He’s never been settled so if your handling is frail
He let go the legos and tell you “catch ‘em if you will”
You catch like D-Will, well and good, have you riding for your team
Until you find out you traded off the bottom of your screen
Like “let me find out”, gave it every line of what I be
Until the time’s out, and this shit is just not what it should be
So every Glock that ever leans and every shot that ever leaves
From off the top of where that beam is red dotting where you breathe
Is in a box apparently waiting out to hear from me
They wait aloud to hear the screams and they about whatever needs
And their hearing’s well and good so if they think they heard a call
They tryna hop outta that box and make you sing the words along
Serenades warrant hearing aids, ringing murder ones
Blue and whites move alike if they should think they heard a drum
And they justifying justice, pulling triggers for the cause
I got a big enough applause off the strength of the allure
Saying this is what it was, well if this is what becomes
Then I became what they paint as the picture never hung
I became what they made as a glimpse of what was won
The W’s at The W, spilling off the hum
The one to do what they wanna do, in it for the run
’Til the tape’s broke in half and I’m praised off of laps
Call it A-side B-side, tape broke in half
And my A-side B-side was made to be exact
No 40 dollar replicas but all of my etcetera’s
Exemplified the inner sides of all that my forever does
Live or die, get us by, bigger signs, better runs
Bigger rides, get inside, visualize what never comes
Minimized inner highs, Phyllis Hy’, level one
Staring at a page and a pill with a heavy tongue
Say that I amaze but I still feel forever young
Heavy is the fade that should fill that New Era son
Imagine it in front of you, like packages that wanna move
So much so that they react without you running to
So running towards is all that you in it for
All the stones in that crown is all that it really was
All them stones on the ground is all that you penning off
From the pitching to the ditching, its more than they get to pump
So chorus them for the trunk, meaning sing for the drive
I’m still the peddlers theme, they say I sing for the drive
Now bring in the reprise, and let the beat breathe
I’ll let you comb through the poem and what’s beneath these
I’m on my throne, Pewter Foams and the seat reads
That “you should know you alone is what the need needs”
So on the low I know the code & how to debrief
But on the low I know the dough is where belief be
So all of my encouragement is pointed on hurrying
’Cause getting it don’t mean that you got it, so we gonn’ hurry this
And get it until each of us got it, you say you listening
I hope that when I speak in these pockets you get the gist of it
They open off of me in them boxes where they be signaling
Like “we see them a block away, so put all of that stock away!”
I come through, windows off, still knocking Rae’
The Hilfiger version, and I feel I’m in its purpose
So I wheeled ‘em where the words is, pedal to the predicate
For the love of money baby, decimals is delicate
For the love of money baby, settling we never did
They can’t fuck with where this effort is
See if I told you everything I ever wanted to say
You’d either nobel prize me or scurry away
And that nobel prize seat?, I’m one up away
“A Dream Deferred” will chauffeur me to one of them thangs
Either a plaque or a stat or a ribbon that’s attached
To a gold plated Alfred, in-scripted through the back
Homey this shit is a wrap, if you was bitching in the past
The future is more looted, baby get it how you ask
The truest to walk through it, so whoever yall spewing
To be that guy back slides, I fountain pen baptize
The same shit that I was with, I’m still in that mind
So never mind who on that side
