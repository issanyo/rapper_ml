[Intro:]
And then he comes out the room
And I look at him
And I’m not bullshitting man
I seen like, like a orange
His aura or whatever, I seen it
It was orange

[Verse 1: Torae]
This feel like the aura
The colour of my glow is tempora
And sound that’s inside will make em’ more’a
For richer or for poorer
I married this bitch
Can’t divorce her
Paying attention shouldn’t cost yah
It’s pearls in the oysters
Diamonds in the coal
And did you sell records outside selling your soul
Sidelines in the cold
City watching your merits
You either goin be Tom Complin or Herman Edwards
Menage with the money
But watch who you in bed with
I’ve seen niggas fuck up O’s dealing with X’s
It’s all hugs and kisses
This shit is a facade
You dawg got it backwards
He think he touching the god
Uneven the odds
It’s us two and the one
I told em’ who would get it
We got it so get it done
You ain’t get your gun
My pendant probably getting their run
I got 99 problems
How to spit ain't one

[Chorus: Skyzoo]
For the aura
Saw it on the way up
Know it's for the aura
So we got our weight up
Know it's for the aura
Saw it on the way up
Know it's for the aura
Love us or you hate us
Know it’s for the aura
It’s for the aura[x3]
Know it's for the aura
Saw it on the way up
Know it's for the aura
So we got our weight up
Know it's for the aura

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
But for this dough yo
The barrel from the coast tho
You know the way the flow goes
Syringes involved
Bars cokeholds
Sprung from the sin in your arms
And all the logos
Stand on the strips that I want
The [?]
This rap shit is a real estate
But my city’s made
The yap you feed then I played
If you feel a way
I rap true to the middle lane
With no give or take
Clap through off this riddle game
Off my middle name
Ah
On my city level
Juggle the same letters
Juggle letters for other rappers cause it pays better
The same one who brought the Gs to the gates
And gold chains, and do-rags at Suite 28
The same one low enough to make them scan
Even swipe through the zone and make away with the grand
I panorama the grammar when I aim at your lane
For the range in this place with the wave of a hand

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: (Skyzoo) & Torae]
Every line is livid
Learning off the glow
And truth be told
We took it where they couldn’t go
It reached new heights
Where others felt they couldn’t grow
The upper echelon balls
(We got em for the low
Shit if you didn’t know
We gave them the reason that they was waiting for
Same height giving you light
It’s what you think you off
Enterprising in some harder work if you with me
My rep is on some go show Charlie Murphy your tities)
Running off at the mouth
Throw a punch and be out
My hand’s all on your spots
Feet’s all in your couch
The legal with the drought
We came with the hell of a flood
Cause cocaine is a hell of a drug
(When ya’ll settle for love I settle for knitting cake
No front’n in the mirror if I should fear the great
Lie from the side, where the ride is the ride
But you winning for the win if you ever should hear him weep)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Torae]
I mean, you know
My shit varies sometimes
Like sometimes my aura
That shit be camo
You feel me
Desert Storm camo shit tho
Sometimes my shit be brown
And I dunno my shit just
Change up or whatever you know
Motherfucking Maroon 5 and all that you know
All these bright colours the whole spectrum daalin
Haha
Yeah
Hey man been wondering and praying
SK & Torae
Battle Brothers you up
Yeah
Yeah
For the aura
