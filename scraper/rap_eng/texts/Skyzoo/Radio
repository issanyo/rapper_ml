"I stopped goin' to the places, we used to go
When they play our favorite song, I turn off the radio"

[Verse One] [Mic Legacy]:
This is my ode to this thing we call "hip hop"
It's 'bout time somebody set it right like it was a wrist watch
If you was hot then everybody knew your jam
B.D.P., Public Enemy, yeah, MC Shan
Fans were really fans
Albums were really albums
Damn I miss the Golden Era, shows that were shows
Big Daddy Kane and Rakim rockin' chunky ropes
Droppin' funky quotes was the way to be dope
Not the crack version
But word and the ill delivery
Would have you rockin' shows from Jersey to Italy
Bambaataa made a lot of Zulus
Do you, remember five Niggas With Attitudes?
LL Cool Rockin' Bells before he turned smooth
You better move Nobody Beats The Biz
Cop Killer, Ice-T, MC Lyte and Rob Base
If you don't remember them get up out my face

[Hook]:
"I stopped goin' to the places, we used to go"
Lookin' for hip hop
"When they play our favorite song, I turn off the radio"
Cause that ain't hip hop
"I stopped goin' to the places, we used to go"
Lookin' for hip hop
"When they play our favorite song, I turn off the radio"
Cause that ain't hip hop

[Verse Two] [Skyzoo]:
Born in the 80's
Kicks and snares raised me
None of this new shit will ever phase me
The 90's was my soundtrack
So everything that I was ever built on
Or was built from is surrounding that
I came up on The Box where it was two dollars a pop
Then you waited by the screen for it to drop
You know it well
My tape collection defines tape collectin'
And if I Ebay it, it's a big collection
From '90 to '99 rewind was the birth of me
I gave my Chi-Ali tape open heart surgery
My first L was blown to the first L
Lifestyles Ov The Poor And Dangerous, it worked well
And I'm still on the purple tape
Still in a purple case
Still duckin' from Shark Biters like how the purple say
And if you're still on your TDK's
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes

[Hook]:
"I stopped goin' to the places, we used to go"
Lookin' for hip hop
"When they play our favorite song, I turn off the radio"
Cause that ain't hip hop
"I stopped goin' to the places, we used to go"
Lookin' for hip hop
"When they play our favorite song, I turn off the radio"
Cause that ain't hip hop

[Verse Three] [Mic Legacy]:
From the 80's to the 90's now we in 2000's
I don't know y'all, it got me really doubtin'
That hip hop would last, it seems like a fad
It's less for the love and more for the cash
Little Brother from the Slum Village be a Black Star
There's more to the game than being a trap star
Record labels ain't the same, record deals ain't the same
You might get a lil' change and a lil' fame
We only 8 years in it seems like six feet in
A grave that we dug our self, we don't love our self
We barely eat because we dub our stuff
Master P changed the game with his distribution
Dilla and Kanye with the ill loopin'
N.E.R.D., D.M.P., Clipse and Nottz Raw
Spiced up the game like pepper or hot sauce
Off is what my radio on because it's all borin'
