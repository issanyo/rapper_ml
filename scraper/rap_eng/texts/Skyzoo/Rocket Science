[Verse 1]
Labeled me different from the jump
When all I was here to do was jump in
Outcast for not knowing what dumb is
They say I'm OutKast with a corner store run in
I listen to 3 Stacks and hope I'm what he fuck with
I know I'm what he fuck with, never mind hoping
Cause dope knows dope so as far as what the dope is
It gets familiar, the memory stays
No matter the time, no memory's vague
So every memory saved
Is recognition of the first time dipping
It feel like the reason you started penning
And I'm from the home of the skid marks, the Popeye big arms
So me being the raw is all I was built for
Growing in your attention while mine is growing hallow
As I type this verse, I'm BBMing a model
Or better yet, she BBMing me
Sending me pictures of all that she wanna give to me
Everything from after the shower to Louis Vuitton receipts
Saying its a gift, and a gift whenever we meet
And I'm trying to finish this record, but believe me
She look like everything I expected, so I be knee deep
ASAP, the beat on playback, I still got more to say
And she can't change that, and I can't break that
As broke as the rest be
Swear what I write is all the shit that they left me

[Hook]
I swear it's not rocket science (x3)
I just tell em what my day is
And they alike so they replay it
I swear it's not rocket science (x3)
I just tell em what my day like
And they alike so they know the date right

[Verse 2]
Never preached on a record, I just said what it be on a record
And made em wanna believe on a record, anytime it's me on a record
I par the bars and don't give em room to breathe on a record
They saying that my ingenuity was designed for you to be
So I be backpedaling going from you to me
I'm still trying to believe in a hero
But I keep aiming for where they be from the get-go
And maybe mine alone, died alone, my hands was by the phone
Like when Omar popped Brother Mouzone by the scroll
And called like come get em, I'm all but done with em
I was often who you loved when Paul was running with em
Apologies, whatever it gotta be
Pay that cost, and hope yall on the side of me
And may that cost be no more than a proper fee
Talking the influx, kidding you gotta be
Shit is just outta me,I right my 24
They say it's complicated but them hours is for the call
Tell em I'm a 95 Nike ad, half cent dog
Got all type of swag, double D Tyra with a wifey tag
Telling me the past is the past in the past frame
Bitches be having babies over night, like what's your last name?
Promise me you'll know it if it's ever you
And not walk around thinking tumor's got the best of you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I swear it's not rocket science, they think I'm probably lying
If you forever been a fan, they say you probably biased
I forever been the stamp of a higher climbing
And they won't let you get a hand if you tryna find it
But I'm in a room full of chargers
Typing out my life for the starters
And ever pair of sneakers is a part of it
Contemplating becoming a martyr
And if I'll even know it if it happens so regardless
I swear it's not rocket science...not at all
