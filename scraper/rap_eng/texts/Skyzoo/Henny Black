[Verse 1]
I never brag how real I keep it
Cause it's the best secret
Nah I kinda do
Shit who better to speak it
And who to be it then the inherited reason
In seeing a corner and the corners they bury beneath it
Polo'd down in Polo downs
Shit could be 20 degrees Yankee logo crowns
Be on regardless
Ears turn red when they frostbit
But we be in them Rovers we don't know what that frost is
Or maybe we do
Dreaming big enough to maybe pursue
And believing in it like maybe we knew
Knew enough to want to know more
You newcomers be new enough to where we don't y'all
But bet you that you know ours
Ours being all of us
Down till they offin' us
Know the detailing of the story and the moral of
And all of it is all that it may seem
I went on a world tour and went home to the same fiends

[Hook]
I promise I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate
My Henny Black, my brim is Grey
I'm in a place where no one will ever get to chase
And pouring now for anybody who feel a way
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate
My Henny Black, my brim is Grey
I'm in a place where no one will ever get to chase
And pouring now for anybody who feel a way

[Verse 2]
Be as it may, you follow me for the day
And find a line full of writers that write to me in they Dre's
The beat, goes on you find the key that it plays
Like it's sitting in the trunk and you tryin to be out the way like
Out the way of the uniform and true to form
I resented how I get it, no tap, truly yours
I mean, wise mean build and destroy
We grew up down the block from where the buildings employed
But skip the avoids
We livin in
Nothin that no one was ever kicking in
Maybe they attempted but none of them got the pit of it
Picture me, living off the way that we was livin it
And all of this from looking out the window
And then you can say you heard S-K
Pulled up in the fresh Grape
And hopped out with the Eggplant Foams like checkmate (ha)
And all of it is all that it may seem
I went on a world tour and went home to the same fiends

[Hook]
