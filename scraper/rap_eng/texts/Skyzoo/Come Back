[Intro: Skyzoo]
Shorty why?
I feel like, if I take a couple words
You know, throw some words at you
You can get a better understanding of where I'm Coming from
And if not, I mean, I can’t say that I ain’t try
Listen
It go, It go

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Baby girl, let me break it down to you
So you can’t say I was playing round with you
You a good catch for me in the long term
But as far as right now Ma', I'm gon' swerve
And real talk, you don’t need to be dipped on
So I rather pull over the V before we get lost
You a hot one girl, believe I’m a fan
But I don’t want you running round like you got a man
I’m only 23, with a lot of life in front of me
And there’s a lot of types I want to see
And I can’t give you my all
When part of me still want to answer my calls
You get it?
You speed racing, and I'm trying to walk
I'm winded
Before I cheat I rather turn it off, and end it
And matter of fact, you can rewind that
It’s more like a pause, call it an intermission

[HOOK: Skyzoo]
We still young baby girl
I want to be sure you the one, baby girl
So I got to move, and if this is true
Then I'mma come back Mami
I'mma come back Mami
We still young baby girl
I want to be sure you the one, baby girl
So I got to move, and if this is true
Then I'mma come back Mami
I'mma come back Mami

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
I got one named Donna, push a little 06' Honda
Swallow me whole, and buy me Prada’s
One named Britney
And all she want to do is come through
Do the one-two, blow a little sticky
Monica is cornbread fed, with stallion legs
Slim waist, rock deep cut Vicki's
And China with the caramel skin and the slanted eyes
Cherry red lips, taste like banana pie
Got a round the way girl named Daphne
She don’t even wait for the crib, we do the back seat
Then I got Jackie, I went and introduced her to Daphne
And now they favorite words is tag-team
Then there’s Tamika, she on that scream shit
And cooking turkey bacon, hash browns and Cheese grits
Then there’s Samantha, Jennifer, Sasha
Stephanie, Crystal, Erica, and Yolanda
You see?

[HOOK: Skyzoo]
We still young baby girl
I want to be sure you the one, baby girl
So I got to move, and if this is true
Then I'mma come back Mami
I'mma come back Mami
We still young baby girl
I want to be sure you the one, baby girl
So I got to move, and if this is true
Then I'mma come back Mami
I'mma come back Mami
