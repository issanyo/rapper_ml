Okay, this is like designer drugs
Say this shit is like a given how they lining up
Bottom of the pocket baby right where you be finding us
You find that when you rewinding us

[Verse 1]
Okay, this is like designer drugs
Hook em off the leak
Got em tripping like they finding love
Look for all you need
I was listening to how they pump
Push that off and leave
That's my interest baby line them up
This shit got me right above echelon gated
I was different than expected so
I helped them along the way and
They was itching for an exit and I helped them on the way
And the top said they could eye it
They ain't guess I have to weigh it
Said they knew like that initially
Skeptical to christen me
Know I'm Kemba fitted and the letters with a difference beat
Know I'm Kemba fitted and the letters with a difference beat
Said it twice so maybe on the second you could picture me
Perfectly aligned on the dolo
The singular
Trying to rub shoulders but they shoulders by my knees
I was shouldering a lead on the dolo
The singular

What you need?
You load up on your sleeve on the low like

[Verse 2]
Yeah, okay the sauna wants to be next
Saw that truthfully
Ya'll ain't blind enough to see yet
So all it do for me
Is it put me on the left
Well they looked at what was left and then desribed me in the leadest
But I'm just trying to G this
From pitching how they couldn't
Get this like I'm Gooden
And you get it like you couldn't
And if they understood it then they right where they should be
And a mountain full of words
It'd be right where they should ski
And you sneeze when it's blessing you
See how much the letters do
Written on your clothes how we seeing all that residue
Sentence round ya nose pardon me for going honest
I call it like I see it when I see it sprinkled on her
I did it once
Did it twice
I ain't have to twin it, right?
I decided to
So providing you was living hype
Did it just as I predicted
Standing in them lights
Got that off to you
What his penning like?
Load up on your sleeve on the low like
