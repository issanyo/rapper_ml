[Intro]
Yes… Ladies & Gentleman.. welcome to the corner of notion & 9th, the next movement family installment…
Fresh off the World Domi-Notion & Soul Movement 3… im bout to keep it movin right now… making one project at a time people…
Dont rush me…
Yo yo…

[Verse 1]
Yo, There's nothing like writin' ya self
Like a nice little poem with 9th, in-sight of a flip
All wonderful tunes, to enlighten ya health
Yet another brilliant mixtape, another kind I designed to rip
Im not rushin' you, you movin' with the most urgent of haste
With a look like, you just swallowed detergent on ya face
Im not listenin', _& barely concerin' what you say
& im earnin' what im paid, I deserve these accolades,(8)
Slow after I burn one, rush, then flow strongly
Attack with aggression, yet I express it, so calmly
& im on some next shit, so Im getting love again
From Wake ya daughter up, to Kevin Nottingham
& as we travel round the lands, uh, its feelin' amazin'
From mainstream love, to college radio stations
From It's My Turn, to the Domi-NoTiOn of the globe
Its like im spinnin' on the Gravatron, outta control
On this edition you'll hear mad anthem's
You'll hear 9th's drums throwin' real bad tantrum's
Damn son! the medium is class, & got the speakers on smash
FAR from that Cam' shit with the Blam Blamers.. so you, know.. (20)
You know..

[Hook]
...I'm on the right path
In a robe, after a niccce blunt & a bath
I know.. I-I know I got the right swag
I blow it in they face & laugh
Go home & figure, re-frame ya shit
You all off the picture
So ugly like the body of Scharzenegger
So figure its just time to leave
Dont rush mE, let mE blaze, time to breathe
So dont rush me...

I know im on the right path
I know this shit will last
Dont Rush Me it's a..
Long road, & we comin thru fast
With the Movement Fam' at last, whoo... damn..

[Verse 2]
I stroll down the bassline, like im knowin' a beat
Or a voice, attached to it, not withholdin' to speak
& lettin' loose, coz im 25, goin on 49
Coz im smashin' cougars and MILF's, like all the time
On the real tho', as the time grows older
I feel im gettin bolder, _& im in more control of
_my passion and my quota's, what im lackin, where im rollin'
& ain't nobody ever knowin', where the Notion gon' be goin', (8)
& im talkin' bout how life is a trip
Like you knowin' that Corner of Notion & 9th's the shit
Just trust me baby, don't rush the lazy
Or the situations gon' get all crazy! (ya dig that??)
So this time to come live, & deliver the raw
Don't rush me, lemme give ya score, (ya wit me now??)
The numero-uno that you know, the kid wit the kudos'
& proved those with no I.Q.'s, are fake, yup, & they pseudo
....you know!

Hook:
...im on the right path
I know this shit will last
Dont Rush Me it's a..
Long road, & we comin thru fast
With the Movement Fam' at last, whoo... damn..
