Yeah I'm hearing the melody
Yeah I'm hearing the melody
Yeah 9th Wonderful tunes
Yeah they trying to hear it though (they try to hear it though)
Ok they trying to hear it though (they try to hear it though)
//Skyzoo//
OK for heavy thing the melody be and what you get to perceive
Its all dependent on the steps and what they've yet to believe
I put a cape on did it for the steps where i be
I got my J off and made 'em wanna step in my three's
And if ever you should attempt you steppin' through to the trench
And if you should live to recall it you'll never do this again
And if you should live to be honest you'll let it do what it promised
I promise to be the reason my 'hood gets another honor
Christopher did it first, Skylar the second coming
I knew when i saw that hearse that I got to keep up the runnings
Knew if you caught a verse then you'd probably want to tuck it
Let the drumming be the talk of The Current
And written in for every ace and every mention
Every RICO in your glare or AZ or rich and the [?] was really there
The shit that screams are made of
Living dreams and wake-ups
And using handbooks to hide the paper
//hook//
I'm hearing the melody (hearing the melody)
And hear what it's telling me
I stood tall next to it to hear what they let it be
I stood tall next to it for fear what it never be (9th)
And i be on my own when i hear what its telling me. ([?] I gotch you)
//Fashawn//
Properly medicated and probably the most debated
Obviously dedicated discography underrated
And its preposterous how i'm popping up on this station
Used to be one of poverty's most popular faces
Niggas try copying and pasting but couldn't copy the cadence
Don't be surprised i keep pocketing paper
Profits is major
Is the population of Rastas out in Jamaica my posse nothing to play with
From a rock o' a Venezuela
Moving more product then El Chapo and the Lavers
Don't even call me an M.C., I'm an ogre
I'm a meteorite, these niggas mediocre
I'd rather be considered an O.G. when its over
In a tinted limousine blowing weed at my chauffeurs
Don Santiago on behalf of my [?]
Been married to the mob, Jasmine Solano. (Nigga)

Hearing the melody
And hear what it's telling me (yeah)
I stood tall next to it to hear what they let it be (Fresh)
I stood tall next to it (air) for fear what it never be
And i be on my own when i hear what its telling me
//King Mez//
Hearing my melody make me liable for felonies
RAK I am with it, what ya'll niggas telling me
Definitely won't be maturing if it don't help better me
Olympic set is on nigga's should probably medal me
Only gold, mental official because I know phony 'fo
People with opinions that matter gonna tell you homie go
Its more the music to me ya'll niggas only 'bout the money
While i'm next to italic buttons like homie bold
King Mez-a-Tron, Sans shots to connoisseurs
Who watch the movie and show love to artists on the scores
And shouts to artists who cool with being my targets
And sweating bullets because i know i can be murder on you pores
Too fast home get enough when I drop
And know that everybody know that I be something to stop
It's probably why I button all my button-ups to the top
My flow classy niggas so don't ash me. (Yeah)
