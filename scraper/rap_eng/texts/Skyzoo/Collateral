[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Can it all be so simple, Cory and Dennis?, 
Top 3s and chopped cheese all thru the winters, 
Box Jeeps and Cardi B's off of the scrimmage, 
Mahogany behind the seats, caught in the lyrics, 
Do you know, where you going to?, draw up what they know of you, 
Picture that with enough space for whoever should go with you, 
Told me what we here for, same way it was told to you, 
My Saint Laz’s heavy enough to pray over both you, 
Meaning, yall and me is, a-alikes for the being 
Of time, time being a way to find you a lead in, 
Gil Scott Heron, Jill Scott heroine, 
Hands folded for apple bags or you Elohim it, 
Be as it may, shit will seem to be straight, 
And banking on collateral's what it be out the gate, 
The beauty of it all but you still see the decay, 
And counting's even prettier baby, so either way, either way 

[Chorus: Jake & Papa]
This shit feels like we living a life on borrowed time, 
This shit feels like we living a life being caught in a high, 
Been in jail since my daddy was born, 
But my pen is collateral bond, 
Oh my God, oh my God, 
Are we really free here? 

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Either way it's, more than just what they're saying, 
Say you look in the tone and it shows you what they're portraying, 
They giving you the tone that you need like you was related, 
Feeling like to atone is to keep it from ever fading, 
Til you knew the tone you receiving was off a payment, 
Like when it's two tones on the V' that you serenading, 
Mike '92 tone on the Beamer, Rockaway Ray it, 
Or white and blue tone from the D's all in the way and, 
It gets, in between, soon as you got it you grey it, 
I mean, silly me for tryna Co-Op and New Day it, 
I be, centerpieced like I was tryna two way it, 
I preach, Hennessy but I see the need to Dusse it, 
The thought of pink bottles of Spade turns into spilling them, 
Over flow on the dough like the red bones that deliver them, 
Yeah, be as it may, shit will seem to be straight, 
And banking on collateral's what it be out the gate, either way 

[Chorus: Jake & Papa]
This shit feels like we living a life on borrowed time, 
This shit feels like we living a life being caught in a high, 
Been in jail since my daddy was born, 
But my pen is collateral bond, 
Oh my God, oh my God, 
Are we really free here? 

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
And you in the back of a rental, in front of a bag of maybes, 
Like maybe shit'll move to where you can call this the 80's, 
Or maybe this is ruined and you in for an awakening, 
And the tone that you knew was the root why you mistaken, 
And waiting, and still waiting, and still waiting, 
Told youngin on my second classic to drill a way in, 
Word to any misconception that they drilled to us, 
'cause you still shooing to kill if you kill the shooters, 
They told us fuck it..

[Bridge: Skyzoo & Jake & Papa]
Either way it's what we want so do believe what we on baby, 
I respond like We just here to pick up on some money 'fore they tell us we gone baby 
They respond like Get it how you live and how you live is how to get it to God baby, 
And I respond like either way you put it this collateral is all off the arm baby
