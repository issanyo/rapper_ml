[Verse 1]
It sounds like we back to the part where you get reminded, 
Where catching everything that you thought will make you rewind it, 
Like everything you knew that you caught, you still behind it, 
So everything you get is in parts, like it's consignment, 
Part of it sounds more like sitting under the floor might, 
Be enough to sit you above what all the applause like, 
And all of the applause is singing in uniform right?, 
And then you take note what these harmonies can harm like 
It sounds like smoke outta the scope how the grey on, 
And then the smoke clears and everybody you play gone, 
And may yall, continue to pray on who you root on, 
Like stay on and make a seance out of a nuance, 
And say y'all get in the way of what I been due on, 
My catalog is like Avon meets brother Mouzone, 
Threw y'all a 3 peat and we bout to part 4 it, 
You either part for it or parkour it 

[Chorus]
This what it sound like, 
When you give the sound light, 
And everything above it wind up under the ground like, 
If everything above it is the reason it sound right, 
Then it was cut from it but it's cut out around like... bet it that...

[Verse 2]
It sounds like raising a .45 and making the floor rise 
All while explaining apartheid, 
All while changing a car ride to aiming at off sides 
All while playing the Pharcyde, and pray if the car dies, 
That you was low enough to get lost by 
Whoever had a set on your door side, 
Closer than a rear view, low as it appears to, 
Where they grow weight and throw weight like Amir do, 
And at The Roots of it all there be more to adhere to, 
Say to do what you do with your arms if you can bear to, 
It sounds like a fist in the air meets a brick in the air 
Meets baguettes meets the vision impaired, 
Or it sounds like visions in pairs 
And depending on how you pronounce both is what'll get to appear, 
It sounds like rug money that turn into plug money 
That turn into overturning the plug's money, this what it sound like 

[Chorus]
This what it sound like, 
When you give the sound light, 
And everything above it wind up under the ground like, 
If everything above it is the reason it sound right, 
Then it was cut from it but it's cut out around like... bet it that...

[Verse 3]
And bet it that it sounds like a run that ain't nobody ever ran on, 
Ship it how I whip it, no dance on, you get your Stan on 
For whoever they got you beside, 
Until your G drop out when it be time to align, 
Line up like twelve when they be Tryna collide, 
They add you on by Tryna divide, another time, 
Know me, know I put the sublime in the subliminal, 
Your fanbase wanna bid something, mine done did a few, 
And when your fave is spitting that shit and you seem surprised, 
I'm Eric betting with Kyle, I'm feeding 'em from behind, 
Word to Kenny, all this works, who working with me?, 
‘cause it was either work out a verse or work a semi, 
Box out like Hakeem, 30/20, 
Threw the pump fake and they’re thinking I work for semi, 
'lotta lines, I’ll leave you the time to go and break those, 
Meanwhile I'm ducking from plain clothes 
'cause this what it sounds like...

[Chorus]
When you give the sound light, 
And everything above it wind up under the ground like, 
If everything above it is the reason it sound right, 
Then it was cut from it but it's cut out around like... bet it that...
