[Skyzoo talking]:
Closed Sessions. Ruby Hornet. DJ RTC. Rhymefest and S.K.Y.Z.O.O. you know?

[Verse One] [Skyzoo]:
The turned the 773 into the 708
They pushed 'em out and said, "Hurry and wait."
It's still the same, they still step on the cake
They make more hotter whatever they made
They turn the corner and the peddler's day
All of it before is a gift of it away
They in the sky
New day, new tide, they grew fresh off the wave
New drive, new peddles and breaks, they in disguise
So I, salute the Chi, I'll never be late
So I'm at Harold's for a six piece
Alfred's where the cjicks be
Atlanta's on the strip tease
Soundscape mixed me
What down Joe?
I think they know as far as lyrically I give 'em me
The corner stores fuck with me cause this is weed
Brooklyn is where I'm raised at
Pusher when I paint that
Chicago is relating so they trunk is where Wayne at
The Manor to the wild 100s
Chatum to Harvey
Ingelwood to Cabrini
Turn it up if you see me

[Chorus] [Skyzoo]:
From the 3-1-2 to the 7-7-3
To the 2-1-2 to the 7-1-8, what it be?
And I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
Yeah, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
From the 7-0-8 to the 8-4-7
To the 9-1-4, if you want it then you reppin'
And I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code

[Verse Two] [Rhymefest]:
New York city where dreams are sold, borrowed and stole
Chi-Town cats bang where it's brick cold
This is Tale Of Two Cities, it's on the move
Home of hip hop and The House Of Blues
Hustler's spirit is what we responded to
Zoo? You ride for me, yeah I'll ride for you
We do it three terms like Bloomberg did and we break the rules
Eye Witness 7, niggas is snappin' and we break the news
Then survive when the ground gets shaky like Haitians do
Let it fall, build it from the ground up, we make it new
Your girl come through with no clothes on, I like the naked truth
I'm from Shy/Chi-Town but I'm not bashful
New York niggas got a lot of bravado but bitch I'm an asshole
I'm a big fish, boy you a tadpole
You wearin' a bubble and still catch a bad cold
I'm on 2 5th, buyin' a loosie
I got a Jamaican chick in Flatbush givin' me pussy
She think I'm southern, but I ain't, they call me Lil' Boosie
Did the DaVinci Code flow, y'all all in my movie
When I'm in Brooklyn I can call 'Zoo to come and scoop me
And if you owe me money I suggest you give it to me nigga

[Chorus] [Skyzoo]:
From the 3-1-2 to the 7-7-3
To the 2-1-2 to the 7-1-8, what it be?
And I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
Yeah, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
From the 7-0-8 to the 8-4-7
To the 9-1-4, if you want it then you reppin'
And I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code

[Verse Three] [Skyzoo]:
Do Or Die, Po Pimp
Crucial Conflict, smoke shit
El Che scopin' it
Com Sense, Po and them
Food & Liquor sketchin' it
Black mags peddling
Drivin' down the block shit
Locked in, level 10
Easy goin', win for win
Twista on his triple shit
Got 'em when they ridin' and they ridin' from the bottom
Pushin' that Adrenaline
I see how that Windy get
I see how they divvy in
Me, I'm from NY so I realize how they get me in

[Rhymefest]:
Ahhh
Shawn Bell caught shells
Amadou caught a few too
Come to my city they beat the shit out of you
Jay-Z beat Kelly
Kanye beat 50
Guess we all even now, Skyzoo you can ride with me
It's El Che and the return of the real
The Art Of War boy, return to the field
We the last two cities to make every rapper return to they skills
And when you done you can return to the Ill
We gettin' busy

[Chorus] [Skyzoo]:
From the 3-1-2 to the 7-7-3
To the 2-1-2 to the 7-1-8, what it be?
And I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
Yeah, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
From the 7-0-8 to the 8-4-7
To the 9-1-4, if you want it then your reppin'
And I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
I, I crack the code
