[Verse]
Short money looked so tall when we stood up near it
Told us that we could see it louder, had to look to hear it
Looking further from what we heard of made it more apparent
Apparently hearing these was looking in mirrors
Tall when we stood up next to it, stood tall if there was ever room for questioning
Knowing all of your rep in it, height became a precedent
Tall like extended's on the end of what they bring when they grip and get to collecting it
Money had us adept to it
Power shotgun in the ride with the respect and so we got to L.O.X'ing it
Track 5 connecting it
And know that if I'm dealing with 5 it's 4-5 in the sky, Mitchell & Ness'ing it
Grey uniform, Nike checking it
Childhood pictures had us pissing on hydrants, G-Depping it
Nickel and diming seems effortless
Til the crown heavy cuz the nickel and diming breed replicas
Saw it off the arm while eyeing the divas jumping outta cars
With lines of fiends plucking on their arms
Bitches brushing em away while they dying to see what's jumping with the bomb
And 550's was dumping outta jars
I mean, who would've knew you could fit a car in a flour jar
Or you can fill it wit half and get your Audi on
Short money looked so long like car payments
But short money turn those off like court cases
Casing a dream like it was yours and we was taxing it
The lane get too cluttered with dreams you start trafficking
The dichotomy of starting at the back of it
I'm a Jay-Z Kweli accident
Hybrid of the park bench and park slope
But the thought of living in park slope was all jokes
"peace God", peace God, now the shit is explained
It makes sense like a lick for a brick and some change

[Chorus]
Short money what they taught us when they put us here
Said it take so long to count it that we wouldn't care
Short money what they taught us when they put us here
Said it take so long to count it that we wouldn't care
Short money what they taught us when they put us here
Said it take so long to count it that we wouldn't care
Short money what they taught us when they put us here
Said it take so long to count it that we wouldn't care
