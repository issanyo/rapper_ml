[Hook: Skyzoo]
Uh, in my sweetest pursuit
Love is love but it never was easy to move
They tell me everything I love and I see what it do
They tell me everything I love but I need it from you
Uh, in my sweetest pursuit
Love is love but it never was easy to move
They tell me everything I love and I see what it do
They tell me everything I love but I need it from you

[Refrain: Kay Cola]
The more we run alone
The less we seem to move
The less we're on our own
The sweeter the pursuit

[Verse 1]
Good intentions at the root of it
Blaming us is only shaping us to keep pursuing it
Reaching for a dollar on a needle, get to looping it
Make enough to say you made enough when you was through with it
'cause none of this is what they was pointing to when we saw them
But still in all we was committed to Tryna see it
Like some of this is everything we have forever wanted
To get involved and to be living beyond reason, right?
Tryna keep it, and draw a tag on it
You know how we get it, right?, duffle bags for it
The simplicity of banking on a victory
And putting your belief in a baton as the centerpiece
But it's one of those, and it's a ton of us
So when it comes to you it comes to every one of us
Treat it all the same and all of this will be different
To see what we became is to see what they all missing

[Hook] + [Refrain]

[Verse 2]
In the spirit of tug of wars where love is lost
In the crossfire and something's drawn and dumping off
Half don't make it, the other half will duck and crawl
And turn Caine tryna save who remains
Raised as a JW and so the wayI was laid
Is on a stake and not a cross, blood stains on the floor
Intuition will kick in and find a way to pry me off
I bring the stake wit me and keep it as memorabilia
Dealers is my audience, uniformed all of it
Made sense like as if I was there when they was offing it
Music for my friends, and due to my begins
I never shook the feeling of the mood that y'all was in
I never shook the feeling of the newest model Benz
But I stopped thinking that rappers and producers was my friends
'cause its a wonderful world til they cutting out the odds
And it turns out loyalty just wasn't in their cards

[Hook] + [Refrain]

[Verse 3]
My pursuit is on a pace of a shooter outta state
Where the heights are getting higher til they grew up outta place
And the lights are getting brighter so you shooting by the stakes
And your aiming get erratic Tryna move em out the way
By the way, ain't a way that we can run this by ourselves
When we do it the pursuance turn the shooters outta shells
So treat it all the same and all of this will be different
To see what we became is to see what they all missing
