[Verse 1:] Skyzoo

My fan base is distributors
Loiters with millions
In a corner sense so that's a hundred thou minimum
And if all it is is all of them then my definitives
As good as my closet and all the kicks I can't fit in them
See me now
Haulin' In
We be out
Pouring in
Turned Bed-Stuy into Beaverton, Oregon
And rap be actually more with the accordance in
Accordingly
I was calling leads bring the corners in
Stans in the stands
They pray I don't bring the chorus in
Cause me on 16 is pause-stop-pause again
King of the rewinds
Literally tree high
Sweeping up the rug shit is littered wit' weave lines

The life of missed calls where each one is a cab away
My video models don't be models
Those is Saturdays
Top floor drop offs
Room is Ace of Spade'd out
Good Italian women
I'm Pauly D to these J Woww's
So may y'all
Remember I don't do this out of choice
I don't choose to be better than the dudes that y'all anoint
This is God given
The bar risen from bar lifting
By the stall wit' it
On cross lights wit' the bartenders
If I part wit' that means
Money in long vision
Turn authentic
My Spur got Tony Park syndrome
Bond wit' us
They say I got the city in the talks again
The upscale vandal of the Walkman's
Wonderfully I

[Hook:]

Okay
Wonderfully I
Been on what I been on
Ain't no wonderin' wit mine
I'm on what I been on
It's like I'm crushin' up the lines
And servin' em' with mirrors
You love what I supply
Baby I

Okay
Wonderfully I
Been on what I been on
Ain't no wonderin' wit mine
I'm on what I been on
It's like I'm crushin' up the lines
And soften em' with mirrors
You love what I supply
Baby I
