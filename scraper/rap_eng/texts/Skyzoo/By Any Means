[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
By any means, my enemy is in plenty reach
So if the need is get 'em leant to get a lead
Then shit'll lean, like literally, hit 'em clean
Until they clean off the mirror, like "shit is me"
And then I'm trying to regroup thoughts
All these plans I was making to get me moved off
And didn't know it, right
Now that I know it right
I'm ducking cameras on the corner trying to blow the lights
Blowing lights, car covered in scars, cutting the smog
And the smoke screens under the stars, what a facade
When the smoke seems up and beyond I bust a U-ey
I'm Old School, all of my slang is that truly
Pardon me if I'm different
Part of me's reminiscing
And part of me's 20/20
So part of me wouldn't miss it
Part of me's Montclair and part is Nautica sweats
Part of me's by the stairs, and part of me's on a jet
But all of me's the embodiment of a Yankee fitted
The only one who was riding up with a Yankee in it
Fuck it though, chalk it up to the rap
Nobody introduced me to Nia so now I'm back
Like, can it all be so simple now? Can it be?
When everyone that you a fan of is a fan of me?
I use that to try to see what just this fandom be
And if it don't go as planned, then I just plan to leave
Leave before it turns and they swear it didn't
By any means you saw the difference
Raised as a witness like Jill Scott and the Jacksons
But born the day before Christmas oh shit I'm probably backwards
I'm living out of a wrapper
Gold ones to be honest
With big XLs all over them if you jocking
Just being honest, something nobody ever is
Relevant problems because the problem is relevance
Invincible in the memo section
Mo'erfuckers shoulder reading, trying to get a reflection
By any means
I'm trying to make it all make sense
Or talk money on the beat so we can all pay rent

[Verse 2: Open]
Playing Cody Chesnutt the theme song
Nothing but an open heart for me to lean on
Trying to get my green grown
Children singing out to the high heavens
Lord please help us help us not to be clones
Wherever we roam
I feel the load weigh heavily telling them reload
I just want peace though
Peace within us are in
Peace from within shines brighter than the stars
And the cars and the shards of the jewel
And the bezel, the tools to dishevel
The views of the youth that are used as a vessel
To tell the truth, I used to dream of it too
But tell me, what's an honest Commie to do?
I mean the obvious route
Stack it up to give it back and what not
Instead of stack to get a pad with a yacht
By any means, I'm trying to feed my people
Need to do or you die
Until I'm in the zoo in the sky
Almighty Open am I

[Hook: Skyzoo]
By any means, my enemy was in plenty reach
Tried to passenger seat it and balance him and me
Shit ain't working so now I'm trying to get where he be
And Subzero that mo'erfucker within his sleep
Looking down at a mirror where his pillow be
Reached for him and got to it to keep him sleep
No hustle involved, but I was beating me
Know the hustle involved if should you see him leave
Know we run to the stars whenever we in reach
How they come through in cars that we don't seem to see
