[Intro]
One...time. Ha. Barrel Brothers doe. Apollo Brown. We tell it like this. Ha

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
You let my jeans tell it, I'm in the club a billionaire
And my boys will zombie whoever for the Thriller there
My agenda's to leave the winners with a killer stare
Until we rock/Roc CEO's with a mil'/Amil to spare
No shots like Raymond Felton, just waving to get a point out
God for the love of a broad who throw your joint out
Bars for the tenders, arms on your men's is like
Pa, we just trying to raise the bar by the benches
I pint of Henny, a pint of Remy with something 50
I die trying to find mine, now who dying with me?
Friends for the win with the hype the man upstairs
Push Earth, wind, fire and ice like Planeteers
The lifestyles of a clique
That wake up every morning watching Lifestyles Of The Rich
Youtube blogging
Bluetooth jogging
Words outta thin air
Excuse who's pardon? I got it from here
Let's do it

[Hook: Skyzoo]
So we got it from here
So this whatever for whenever we pop up in here
This whatever for whenever we pop up in here
And that's forever if you let up a spot up in here
So we got it from here
We got it from here
We got it from here
We got it from here
And this whatever for whenever we pop up in here
And that's forever if you let up a spot up in here
So we got it from here

[Verse 2: Torae]
(Tor' you got 'em right?)
Yeah I got 'em Sky
A lot of rappers is flaming but they ain't hot as I
Tired of being minus Y
That ain't the shit they respect
So when we start mailing reality checks
Address mine out to Simply The Best
Ship it as cargo
And I return to sender that new god flow
As far as the god go
And how I'm moving, it's partial
If y'all doing well I'm Well's Fargo
The jacket is Starter the sneakers is from the brand
The flow is narcotics the speakers is hand to hand
I'm moving my target from reaching across the land
To features on other planets
Tweekers should understand it
My quest outta this world
And if I'm in your hood, I'm fresh outta your girl
Best out on referral
Since S. Dot left the borough
The heirs to the throne been the topic
But I'm here to tell you niggas who got it

[Hook]
