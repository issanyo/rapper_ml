1st verse:
Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
But them short ambitions is more than you'll ever know
Call them small wins but for my friends in the hole
That money will make the bondsman call up to let 'em go
Shopping sprees, dropping G's on the shoes your girl choose
Like "fuck is there to lose"?
Bouncing in the pine rover, stunt and drive slower
Day ones over my shoulder, no one can fade me
Chrome stocks gleaming, grown man im good on the features
And finding 50's up under the seats and
Get to reaching if you want it
I'm leaning on anybody interrupting in the sound of my money doubling
Cups runneth, over with 100's and running
To snatch a couple more cups with cupboards to tuck 'em
End of discussion, I got the Ni√±o Brown flow
To squeeze the town til I'm gone
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up

Hook:
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
Well maybe one day you'll be a star

2nd verse:
Last seen outta state where I got my name
I'm deep in the south serving up top game
Running through a city and they're coke bottle dames
They work at the shake club, their money ain't a thing
Your worst fear it seems, me and my guys roll tight like the CMBs
And get to this money for the love of bleeding green
Geno the way we Jet over screens
We together like a link to hit a Brinks before you blink
We flip checks like 'Bron, stitch reps like yarn
And Tryna stretch like a bond
My joints is Show Mag, who dig in their own bag
And we sip Nobilo and live by Hov raps, you kno the facts

Pre-hook:
But until then they think
I'm the one who's crazy
Cause that's the way you're making me feel
I'm just tryna get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

3rd verse:
While y'all munching punching the clock
I did the same til I cut out a lane and got the fuck out that box
Never again be under that rock
I caught visions of the Roc, no K, and I wanted a spot
Unstoppable, it read like a heist, run the drop on you
We want the light that's on top you
My motto?, stack rocks like Colorado
The stress turned us into Hennessy aficionados
And it's a damn shame what you're not, who?
Slick like a gato, Skyzoo
My pops knew just what he did on the slide through
Talking like the greatest and that's just what he created, ha
Legendary, one of one
Could pulled out for y'all sake but what's done is done
Fast forward to me and, know what I be on and the song we believe in
Fuck you even
