[Hook (Digable Planets Sample)]
We be to rap what key be to lock
We be to rap what key be to lock

[Verse 1: Torae]
Okay
We be to rap what key be to lock
What Puff was to B.I.G., Shock G was to Pac
M.C. be to pop
You think I mean Mariah
I'm meaning the same dude that clapped you was on the flier
No sparkles in the bottles
No hookah for hookers
Few stacks as a deposit the only way to book us
Dress lavish for the lookers
Average, they mistook us
Now they call him Chef Ro Gray
Get at him and he'll cook you
I mean
The dude with the fitted to the front
Really came to get his city what they want
I've been different from jump
My kick game is so Dwyane Wayne
All that's missing is the flip-ups and the fade
I've got Whitleys for days, konichiwa
It's not a game though
Riches and the bitches is what I came for
Then I switch my angle
Was unchained like I'm the Django
Now that shit dangle 'til my ankle and grow
Thanks yo, I'm glad that you tried this trip
Could be anywhere in the world besides my dick
Who taught him to get it done, cash rules
That's it
From the get-up, Barrel Brothers the clique
Click

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Uh
No bottle service and no performers
Prayin' over Henny you swear was holy water
Model bitches that follow winners from off the corner
I'm not a singer, and not a singer is on the chorus
Nah, homie I rap
As far as throwin' a rap
Mine get in your clothes, if you try and go for a strap
Mine give it and go, like I'm tryna' throw you a pack
My motto is for the low, and she ridin' low in the back
And me?
I'm the reason they hate the dress code
They know the joints will be there, from Louis to retro
And me?
Handle buyers, I give a hand to the highest
And single-handed the fire
Your Instagram is a liar, you see
Can't deny us when the city get involved
The security is fans, so we in with who we want
You see, we run low, the face of my zip code
Couple Diamer bracelets
Bodies where the stage is
Find us where the cake is
Movin' like we need it
But my closet talkin' different, so it's truly like we beefin', you see
And by time we get in and out of rhyme
You lookin' for Hypnotic like if this was '99

Tunnel vision, comin' off the shelf like
Turn whatever the 27th and 12th like
Know we here to put the feelin' in the city like
Know we here to put the feelin' in the city like

Tunnel vision, comin' off the shelf like
Turn whatever the 27th and 12th like
Know we here to put the feelin' in the city like
Know we here to put the feelin' in the city like

One time, put the feelin' in the city like
Know we here to put the feelin' in the city like
One time, put the feelin' in the city like
Know we here to put the feelin' in the city like
