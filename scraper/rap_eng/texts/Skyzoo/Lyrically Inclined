[Verse One] [Skyzoo]:
Mothafuckas wanna hate on me to make history
Supposedly, I was the man that was supposed to be, the cocoa leaves
The M.I.C.s and if you've been knowin' me then you know
That all of that is true homes
All of that is true tones
None of that is fabricated
I do this and the sophomores need to be glad they made it
The truth is
The freshman is here
The freshest of the freshman in here
And the rest of this year is a freshman affair
You already know what my pen is about right?
Frontin' like you didn't and knockin' can give 'em an out right
This is just a scrimmage, see I've been kickin' 'em out light
They ain't gettin' a vision and I can kick 'em out light
Right?
There's only one that's really better with speakin'
But he outta town and you gotta go to Heaven to meet him
Call me 'Flower'
S to the K-Y phenomenal
7-1-8 sky nation wide I got us dawg

[Chorus] [Skyzoo]:
Lyrically
Everything they look to be is everything we've been
Yeah, everything they look to be is everything we've been
Yeah, everything they look to be is everything we've been
Yeah, everything they look to be is everything we've been
Lyrically inclined (BK what up?)
Lyrically inclined (DC what up?)
And tear these motherfuckers out they shine (PG what up?)
Ah, ah I'm lyrically inclined (Skyzoo what up?)
Lyrically inclined
I'll tear these motherfuckers out they shine

[Verse Two] [Wale]:
They call me lyrically inclined
They chemically imbalanced
I'm lookin' like a mountain, forever lookin' down at 'em
A never ending escalator that we livin' on
As if the Lord recorded us with His mixin' board
And the day of hip hop is nearly fallin' off
Nearly every new artist got the people nodding off
We young brothers that the O.G.'s nodding for
They've been applauding for Wale and Sky's monologue
Ain't never mindin' y'all
We gettin' gwap to talk
So Scott and I feed lines (felines) like Lion war
I had died in the heart of the haters
They salty
DMV to BK, I made it
And I got soul like a Grizzly turned Laker
And Lohan to my flow is just like Britney with no make up
Nike I.D.G. shock, fuck a Jacob
Shit is about to shape up
I'm wavin' on my way up
Hi haters

[Chorus] [Skyzoo]:
Lyrically
Everything they look to be is everything we've been
Yeah, everything they look to be is everything we've been
Yeah, everything they look to be is everything we've been
Yeah, everything they look to be is everything we've been
Lyrically inclined
Lyrically inclined
And tear these motherfuckers out they shine
Ah, ah I'm lyrically inclined
Lyrically inclined
I'll tear these motherfuckers out they shine
