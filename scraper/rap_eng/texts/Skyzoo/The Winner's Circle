(Verse 1)
Uh, tryna' to measure this out
And the checklist is everything they ready to doubt
And the skeptics is everything I left in the drought
I don't exit, I just get my letterin' out
Couple words on the curb I aim to boomerang
The burbs caught wind and signaled a newer lane
And I'm wit it, just know I'ma still do it the same
But I'm startin' to debate if I outgrew the frame
I'm tellin' myself nah, there's room at the edge
But the truth of it all is, I'm through with the ledge
All the records that I made and the goals I put in 'em
Hopin' that instead of just hearin' me they would listen
Only to be told that half of 'em didn't get it
The other half got it and carried it to the endin'
But I'm tryna' reflect what I'm tryna' protect
I'm tryna' arrive and they tryna' neglect

(Chorus)
But I get it, got it when they said it from the jump
Rings on the table like how many you want
And I'm wit it, positionin' is up something better
And play the winner's circle forever
Ok I get it, got it when they said it from the jump
Rings on the table like how many you want
And I'm wit it, positionin' is up something better
And play the winner's circle forever

(Verse 2)
An open letter to 'em all
A better understanding of everything I'm on
Labelin' me now is forever in the wrong
If they never understand it they never really saw what I kryloned up
So I'm sittin' here looking for ways to troop through this
The last thing I want you to think is it's cool losin'
Shake hands if the help is there
I mean, best at it but the shelf is bare
So the reality of this
Is tell David Stern I'm attracted to the chip, I'm playin' for that
And my game will stay the same, I'm workin' my prime
On the nightly I still give you 30 and 9
So I'm out here in Greenwich, buttoned-up image
My decision decided, bulls-eye winnin'
Boys and girls club, sittin' wit Jim Grey
The discussion is if I win will things change
Went above and beyond you can never doubt me
And this is tough but I'm taking my talents to South Beach
Could've stayed if I wanted to make this about me
It's more so for all of the people around me
Cuz winning is the most confusing of any virtue
And based off of the journey and what it earns you
We could be havin' a ball in this winner's circle
Mind made I hear what they tryna' say

(Chorus)
