[Verse 1: Skyzoo]

Ok i’m right back right back
Driven off the light wrack
My adrenaline is with the wodders wid the lights at
I don’t middle men for all da homers that they might let lack
Gotta listen em and their responses with the height track
May believe it outta ignorers and I can recall this
Is being what they obviously wanted but probably lost us
Used to hide the trophies but there's too many to keep it straight
Now I let the streamers hang if that'd help you see the way
23rd letters accumulate, for you to say that I can fall back to the twelve
Just never knew the stakes
Those is W's and L's for all of you that's late
Run the one truthfully well, see how I drew the play
X marks the spot, my check start to stop
Connect across the dots I’m shoe box made
When this metallic [?] I was dribbling across
My footprints in the concrete is a penny for your thoughts
At it

Hook:
You know, you know, you know what the winning 'bout
Telling my ambition got me trippin on the winners route
Never be the same when you see what all da winning 'bout
So when you shoutin' the winners out
Do remember us (us), do remember us (us)
When you shoutin the winners out
Do remember us (us), do remember us (us), do remember us (us)
When you shout the winners out do remember us

[Verse 2]

(3d with the beast) I transform, ill-mind, metamorphasise
Shape shift unorthodox the way the author scribe
Off the wall, on another plane different paradine
Switching lanes, switchin' chains, doin' different things with mind
My design intricate, I refine sentences slick with pinish ur frame images where the winners sit
Associated with greatness, hard work benefits
Do remember the name and don’t forget the faces
I live the fast life underneath the bright lights
On the big stage, got on my game face
If I can make it here I can make it anywhere
Plus the world is foul, filled with tenant fear
So I can't flop even if I do drop
See me gettin' right back up
The game don’t’ stop
So I let my next move always be my best one
I am a gift from God I am a blessed one so

Hook:
You know, you know, you know what the winning 'bout
Telling my ambition got me trippin on the winners route
Never be the same when you see what all da winning 'bout
So when you shoutin' the winners out
Do remember us (us), do remember us (us)
When you shoutin the winners out
Do remember us (us), do remember us (us), do remember us (us)
When you shout the winners out do remember us

[Verse 3]

That’s silver back guerilla circuit
20 milligram percocet
Not bling bling, but sing sing- 3 ring circus rap
Not for the mainstream
But a higher purpose that services blue collar workers who cannot afford to purchase that [?]
So you know where my boys are
You remember do remember us like toys R
The most prestigious lawyers could never help me avoid bars
My face scarred up, incarcerated
Obligated to a vendetta to rap better than Garcia Vegas
Retarded playlist,god related thank god we made it
Mastery of a master recording with out an affidavit
And I'm taken the winners route
You at the mark im at the finish line drinkin the Guinness Draught
From the beginning, it's always what it's been about
Bounce pass, Chest pass, run the weave, in an out
2 a days, everyday, we shoutin the winners out

Hook:
You know, you know, you know what the winning 'bout
Telling my ambition got me trippin on the winners route
Never be the same when you see what all da winning 'bout
So when you shoutin' the winners out
Do remember us (us), do remember us (us)
When you shoutin the winners out
Do remember us (us), do remember us (us), do remember us (us)
When you shout the winners out do remember use
