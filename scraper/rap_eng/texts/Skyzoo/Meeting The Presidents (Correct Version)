Verse 1:
Who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce, stack cheddar forever
Live treacherous til it get to us
Doing what's best for us as far as today
Let tomorrow be tomorrow and tomorrow can wait
We need it now, need a sound that we can barter or chase
To be around what we around is solely on us to trace
And you call it how you see it, we call it a way
Or to ignore the allure beaming all in our face
But shit you offered a taste, and we wanted the recipe
Learn it and burn it before they get to reach
You feel me?, jealousy and slanted eyes wanted to kill me
Or at least spoke like it but no one approached like it
So yea, any stress in the air isn't from them
But it's more so my morse code building within
We talk low in wardrobe built for the wind and the win
Cause confetti can fall at any given
Hopes tell you get in, dreams tell you to stay awhile
If it all should fall apart before you take a bow
Then may the day being living proof that you made a way
My '01 was a Shawn Carter '88

Verse 2:
I want money like Cosby, who wouldn't?
Or at least raven symone the way raven symone was cooking
May have been wrong or I may have mistook it
But my intentions were to talk to you through song and sing how we looking
They showed us everything but looks deceive
They made a world to paint a world where only crooks can breathe
Then they dared us to take a breath and dared us to make a left
When the right after the lights was what they pushed beneath, you see
Shit I'm involved with got me pens and needles
Cause if this pen don't push the needle where I need to it'll be it'll be pens that bleed you
I'm here to tell shorty
It ain't all swell there's heaven then there's hell
That'll catch you once you fell shorty
We all fall it's just about where we land
And your heroes on all fours like they forgot how to stand
But the ones who stood tall be the ones who raised us
Forgive us for being stubborn, industries couldn't change us
And well, if that should hinder us from Tryna get a digit up
Then we'll just take it back to what we know and what the ceiling does
Conflicts of corresponding with my inner me
Representing infinity for presidencies you know
