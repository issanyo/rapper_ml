I just wanted an Ernie Barnes
Name dropping ain't a problem if it turn you on
Looking for supplies make you ride til the curtain's drawn
Liquor store plans that dwindle down into murder warrants
I'm JJ Evans in a Louis belt
Balmain jeans loose enough to keep a shooter's help
And I swear they keep telling me to remind y'all
That they don't read blogs unless it helps 'em to find y'all
And those is the guys that I call friends
That's looking for thick bitches inside of a small Benz, and me?
Outside of my door was style wars
But behind it was limiteds that covered the house walls, and me?
I'm 50/50 as far as how I was drawn
So whether we in the lobby or black tie the ball
I'm just as good on the first as I am on the last
I grew up knowing the first like I planted the stash
I grew up knowing the worst with my hands on the dash
Of a Rover
I learned French and learned soda
A meeting of the 2, made it easier to move
Conversing with a mirror like I'll leave it up to you
Same as I always did it, what's the wonder for?
Lived up to all your predictions and shook the wonder off
All black walls, the living room will astound you
Covet that wall, it somersaults in value, right?
I just wanted Kadir Nelsons
And when he did paintings for Jeter I clear helped him
You're welcome, now I'm looking at 10 of those
The crib get appraised its a gallery within a home
I wanted Leroy Campbells
His spot was around the corner
My pops spent money on him
The blocks that I was walking
Was black art and black hearts, black bags of black gas was by the stash mark
And now the scene replays
A couple Kenneth Gatewoods
A couple TTKs, go!
Name dropping ain't a problem if it turn you on
Everybody talking Ellis Wilson once they heard the song
On the steps
Watching Biggie in the lex
The same one Nas mentioned
Passenger side Kim and
Growing up tryna mimic
That was us, that a must
Dating rich broads, turned Sports Center, batter up
Google turns rumors to reporters at your door
While your phone going stupid, wrong numbers talking raw, chill!
Thinking I just want a Picasso
Nobody can fade him, 4th member of The Lox flow
PJs in the morn, hard rock suites
10 cases of spade, 6 bottles in each, right?
Really there's nothing I wasn't in for
So to label me a backpacker is an insult, right!
Told 'em I just wanted it all
All black walls, I did it just how you thought, muhfuckers

[Hook]
All black walls, all green pockets
Ain't nobody complaining cause can't nobody stop it, nah
The living room will astound you
Covet that wall, it somersaults in value
