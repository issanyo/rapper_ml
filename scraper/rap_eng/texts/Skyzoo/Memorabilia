[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Legends never die
We just proceed to draw the line
A double, and turn a 23 to a 45
Or divide a cut a 23 up into a 6
Staring at the crown and sizin up do it fit?
The truth, dudes handin it over is over due
We cuttin hands off if hands is slow to move
I'ma Stanfield waiting, in a room with a stringer
While he stand on his word while I stand impatient
All this co-op talk, all this sharin the pot
It sound cool till it's time for you to clear out your spot
Nobody wanna retire, nobody wanna proceed to
Until I’m swinging clubs, like go and pack up your people
Gentlemen about it while im tyin up my sneakers
Bet a trophy at the enters was divided between us
And your idols turn rivals
Tears turn to laughter
I'm signing rookie cards
Get your cash up ma'fuckas

[Hook]
Couldn’t afford our autograph
Legends never die, we cornered that and do it like, hey
And if memory serves
Hall of fame, how we’re giving you words and get to it like
Until they’re putting jerseys in the rafters
Until they’re putting jerseys in the rafters
Until they’re putting jerseys in the rafters
Memorabilia is what we’re after

[Verse 2]
Takin a hundred Rhymes like a hundred shots
A 82 game season like a hundred spots
Touring ain’t no different than balling
They calling with that old lame, is you gonna run or not?
The same shit I had on for my release day
It’s going for a few racks off the eBay
Niggas placing they bids taking pics with the kid
From all the stages we did, rocking in each state
I came to this motherfucker to leave legendary
Never sold a million copies, but it ain’t never worried
Cause if a million ears could turn to a million cheers
And last me a millions years then fuck it we millionaires
Until my shit hanging in the rafters
That green purple and gold is what I’m after
Ha, after the tears come the laughter
I’m signing rookie call
Get your cash up, motherfuckers

[Hook]
