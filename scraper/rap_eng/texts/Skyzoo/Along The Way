The allure of just saying no more
Like I done said the most and if you waited too long
Then that's you, that's on you and the time that's in the air
But if you need what it be the rewind button is there
I tried rushing you here but you was kinda content
And now shit's getting thick and its you that's climbing the fence
I did it from day one, I never took off a night
I never shook off the light, in the midst of a great run
I told you what I was on and showed you double or nothing
The ones who really heard are the ones who cut the discussion
Like "nah, Sky got it, there's nothing for him to prove
If he ever laced 'em up you'd be running outta ya shoes"
You being whoever,the name of them doesn't matter
They know I'm not for play, I'm raising them up as rappers
But the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
And then it gets tough to say I'm a fucking rapper
2 for 2 with the classics and got a 3rd coming
And I ain't drop one verse that didn't earth something
Even the throw always was shit you would go to play
And say that the only thing beside it that you kno is jay
The day ones, all of them know how me do
I'm pretty much Earl Manigault but no needles
So when you talking Kareem or Wilt or Connie Hawk
Remember who they was modeling when they stepped on the court
Stand for the city?, I done stood forever
Every record was Brooklyn bridge overlooking together
Every record was Southside or the X or Harlem
Or the islands, I was about 'em so I'm begging your pardon
But lets say I went and did it, brought him straight to the work
And at the end was an arrow to point him straight to a hearse
Would the power circle of the city stand tall
And recognize the real and how they handle support?
Doubt it, and I can jump for the bait that he leaves
I'm NY to the death when they was changing they teams
But they opened up the doors for him to say what he please
It don't help that the real king went and gave him the keys
Doing verses on a remix, shit why wouldn't he think he's it?
I would think the same with all them reach ins
Not a shot it's a drop of honesty
And if I pour the whole glass that's more that you gotta clean
So I'll leave it there and you know where I stand
Talking music for my friends and one love to my fans
So I'll leave it there and you know where I stand
Talking music for my friends and one love to my fans
