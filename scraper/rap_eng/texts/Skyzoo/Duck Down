[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
The most relevant, Most benevolent
Product of the curb but the words sound heaven sent
Fuck them other words, I mean my words wild better than
The words they was peddling
I word it how they never did
I'm word for word, the worthiest of the veterans
That's still in his rookie stage, I'm pennin' a book a day
I'm givin' 'em look aways, pushed away pick-and-rolls
Hinges off the door when I'm on so yeah I'm kickin' flows
Ten deep hoodies and vestses I sell lines with the ladders
With the line so you can climb if you lookin' to catch it
16's for the fiends, you pay me to throw them raps
20 on the dollar like if we stole it and sold it back
The most anticipated, they itchin' to play it
But they good with the waitin' 'cos they know what I'm creating is straight
Props Joe on the bust down, I cut ground
The newest member of Duck Down so what now?

[Verse 2: Torae]
I'm a heavy distributor of bars man
Wilder than Tarzan. Marty Mart got em like "Ohh damn"
Tore back jottin' his jaw again
I'm back into beastin' the bars again
I'm like a drunk back at the bar again
And no rehab could startle him
No intervention or AA or narcotics anonymous
Born to bully the beat and then body it
And I ain't even reached my prime yet
Niggas feel like I'm Optimus
They witness my opulence
Occupational hazard, ambiance
The lyrics couldn't make it more obvious
My 16 sentences penned in the penmanship
I'll make the pupils pull their pencils in
See I went from the star student to the leader on the unit
Niggas love the way I do it now they're movin' with my movement
What now? you fuckers is fucked now
Ain't nothin' else to do but duck down

[Verse 3: Sean Price]
Too hard for white linen, straight, no white denim
You like white women then listen to Lyfe Jennings
I'm black Nike Venom with the white stripe in 'em
Black Levi's with a knife to strike in 'em. "P!"
I'm a gun boy, 2 in your dome nigga
Dumb boy, I one troy funeral home niggas
Listen, I'm smooth like Romello on "Sugar Hill"
You a john on Hunts Point, you be where the hookers chill
Fake chains on rap niggas be lookin' real
Bullshittin' and trippin'
Like I just took a pill
You do coach bags. I do kush bags
You a douchebag, I'm the truth fag
Share greedy, ya'll niggas get scared easy
Queer like multiple pairs of Air Yeezys "P"
Illest nigga in Bucktown, I snuff clowns
SK, Torae, Sean P, Duck Down!

Muthafucka...
