[Vocal sample from New Jack City - Nino]

[Verse:]
Happy New Year
Welcome to the Spotlight with the Flavor Flav
Everybody say “Happy… New Year”
Oh yeah
This is the fruit of our hard work
The belief in the entrepreneurial spirit
The new American dream
A toast
A toast to my family in life... until death
Happy New Year
Happy New Year
To C&B, on and on
Am I my brother’s keeper?
Yes I am
Am I my brother’s keeper?
Yes I am
Am I my brother’s keeper?
Yes I am
Yes
I am!
