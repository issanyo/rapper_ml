This is a story
Of when the streets fall in love
Really fall in love, where your life depends on that love

For the average ghetto child, the yellow brick road is dim
The lights are blacked out and the chances are cut slim
The success rate never outweighs the opposite
Money, cash, hoes, is something we gotta get
Boys learn how to be men from getting caught up
And grown women can't find time to raise daughters
So this is what happens when a girl is left out
A future princess forced to the next route
Her name was Heaven, beautiful from day one
An angel on Earth if god ever made one
But she was born and raised in the pits of poverty
Cocaine deals, homicides and robberies
Daddy walked out on Heaven before preschool
Mommy wasn't around to show her what the streets do
She was finding out what a bottle of Hennessy does
And hated her daughter for being prettier than she was
Seemed like Heaven knew anything but that
The older she got, the more hell would come back
By the time she was approaching thirteen
She knew how to lick them lips and work jeans
Eighteen came and went, and so did high school
She paid the bills by fucking with the right dudes
But she wasn't known for ho'ing in the streets
Classy with hers, no ass, just hugs
Something like a female mac, full blown
Never fall in love with her, you know the code
But all that changed when her eyes were placed upon Marcus
Neighborhood hustler, heartless
Grew up the same way Heaven did
Parents was dead beats, so he felt heaven was heaven sent
Started off slow then it grew sky-high
Ladies and gents, meet the new Bonnie and Clyde

Chorus
They say true romance is hard to get to know
And the ones with it never really let it go
But when it's hood, the real stick by one another
And you ride or you die for your lover
And that's real

The more time passed, the more they were together
They both found love so they was down for whatever
He gave her quality time, she would hide his bricks
Soul mates, he called her his ride or die bitch
Needless to say, she deaded the blind dates
Marcus was still in the streets, but why wait
He took her out of her home, took her out of her hell
She said bye to Reeboks, said hi to Chanel
Anything Heaven wanted, Marcus gave her
And she adored him, looked up to him like a savior
She would be his lookout when he was doing dirt
He gave her a .22 and made her keep it in her purse
Showed her where the stash was under the mattress
And she would give him back rubs without him asking
He made her bag dudes, flirt a little bit
Go on dates while Marcus would stick up the crib
They was ruthless, but honestly, how could you blame them?
They only had each other, nothing is what they came from
But the hood was hating, and when they saw the money they was making
The cops was sent in to break 'em
Heaven got rid of the coke before they kicked in
So Marcus was only charged with breaking and entering
Judge hit him off with a mandatory 5
Small bid but Heaven knows he couldn't do the time
For the first two weeks, Heaven fell apart
She ain't just lose a man, she lost her heart
And every week she was sending him letters and pictures
Slide through on a visit, give him weed when she kissed him
Six months passed and Marcus couldn't take it
Being in a box was stripping his heart naked
Fuck that, he wrote back in one of his letters
"Daddy's coming home, I need a piece of Heaven"

Chorus

Late night, Marcus kidnapped one of the guards and
Snuck past the security margin
Dressed like a C.O., he met Heaven in the next town
With a rent-a-car, but little did he know
Word spread fast that an inmate dashed
And pigs from all over was plotting on his ass
Cop cars flying at 110 speed
Tipped off by a gas station at 10-D
Shots start going off aiming at the rental
Heaven at the wheel and shit is getting suspenseful
One flew through the back, caught Marcus in the back
And tapped the bone, he felt something crack
Heaven started crying and sweating all heavy
Doubling the speed limit but holding it steady
Marcus told shorty to drive to the crib
She thought he was crazy but still listened to her baby
Parked out front and dragged him up the stairs
Went inside and laid on the floor, scared
The bullet still sitting there, stuck in his spine
He whispered to his woman that he's coming to die
Now she's getting hysterical, taking it hard
He said before I go to jail, I'd rather die in your arms
She crawled to the mattress, pulled out the .9
Kissed him goodbye and helped him close his eyes
With his lifeless frame laying there in her lap
Her heart felt weak, her soul started to crack
She started hearing sirens, the D's was coming
But without her other half, she couldn't see running
Cops start kicking in the door all reckless
She took a deep breath and reached for a weapon
Put it in her mouth and ruined the cops' plans
Squeezed the trigger, she was back with her man
In heaven
