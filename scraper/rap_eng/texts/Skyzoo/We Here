[Verse 1]
Hey, ok
Theme music do a fly by, covered in horns
And followed by a timeline of what you endure
If you up on that timeline you one with the core
Peruse when I slide mine, I'm one with them all
Say I won the applause, my humble oblige
Lens Crafters thereafter
Who fucking with I
Tell him rafter to rafter I cover the sides
And they Parappa The Rapper, no wonder you blind
1-2 it, how I'm moving, enough, it's disguised
Where I'm rooted got em to it, I'm the one in the Sty
To the other side of the bridge, I'm the one on the side
And hey tell him when I'm not there, brotherly ties
I'm just saying what they saying when they playing what I'm saying
And I'm saying that they playing when they saying what they saying
Holla if you get it, I'm tiger-blood winning
And did it by myself, gotta love the grinning

[Hook]
Til they close up shop (hey)
Flow gon' rock (hey)
Got mine forever, know that off top (hey)
Got mine forever, know that off top (hey)
Got mine forever, I told them off top
We here X 4
I tell em
We here X 4
(watch this)
I tell em we here

[Verse 2]
Watch this
Grey bottom fitted
I was made by that fitted
And that last one standing
That can tell you how we did it
Made mine in it you can paint Sky in it
Get em running like Giradi
I can train y'all in it
Yves Saint frames shit
Louis to the nudies
She says I be wasting
I be saying truly
She say that she wasted
I be on my Cooley Cochise like a motherfucker hov' on moolie (?)
Circa the 80's yeah I saw it really happen
I was there when it was there
I'm recalling if I rap it
So all of that imagining
All of that could have them
I be over here living all that she be asking
Spade at the crib, shit, we don't gotta stay here
Say it then I live it you can see it when you play there
Made it off a penning shit
He don't gotta page here
Fly guy etiquette
Clean them out the way here

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bring the horns to it
The horns do it
Enough where I can walk to it
And yall knew it
So I don't gotta part 2 it
I part through it
And both sides part looping
Rubber-banding
Looking like the part moving
The U-N-O
So true litho
Flow through sti-doze
No two ditto
So hurry up and get your thing together
Or them horns gonna ring forever
Talk to em baby

[Hook]
