Verse 1:
We used to catch them, skating thru the town, putting it down, knew the M.O
The window was low enough for them to throw out a signal
From watching how they made it, to Tryna find out way in
Praying for one became just as common as saying grace is
Imagine if you will how happiness gets fulfilled
From deals that get you caged and actions that get you killed
My life is based on sacrifices, either these lights get
Bright enough or ima have to break something down
See what my mind do?
It built me where it kills me in light of its own survival
For real, ironic ain't it tho?, how shit became at home
Made us go outside until all we'd want is to make it home
Decisions decisions, and what I'm here to get is a given
But given where I'm at to get in position is like
The price of Louis got me, deeper than ever
And just think, boosters is getting fewer by the day right?

Verse 2:
I took a drawing to the jewelers from a girl I went to school with
And asked him what it would take to show the world the way I'm moving
He said, "give me a week and you won't even have to speak
They say the walls are the pinkest when the diamonds are the bluest"
My bad, pardon me for being harsh or abrasive
I'm just explaining the drive we was on to try to make it
Jeweler man, he knew it, I got the stories to prove it
Back when I had the 2 door, tearing the conduit
See me?, I'm taking wages wit my neighbors just in case
Bron have a major night off, that's new money
I blew money on bottles while standing next to the rappers who had deals
With budgets on stand still, it really happened
My pinky ring became a star to them up in the stands
My joint was acting like somebody might cut off my hand
Not in this life, that's right
FGR, we keep it tight

Verse 3:
You feel my triumph, never, you feel my pain, you lying
Tuck that away cause I am, the best you haven't heard
But all your favorites have, and that's the tug of war
You let them tell it I'm the best long as you close the door
Sucking me in like a vacuum, but still I'm low
My Capricorn tendencies make me frigid cold
In '99 like, me and mine like
It's whatever on this rise 'long as this elevator's sublime
I wear black a lot, dress code back a block
And Jordan gave me these cigars, go ahead and crack your box
Vividly (vivid-ly) my vision
Came to for the win but my mind got me panicking the ending
Looking for a 'mil, a Lauren London with wheels
But I already got a phone full of those, Brooklyn know
Ain't no stopping the Bel Aire Rose from popping
The more I live it the more I can't watch it, I hate it
