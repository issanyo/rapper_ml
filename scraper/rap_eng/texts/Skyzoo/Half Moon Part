[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Still call me S-K-Y-Z-O-O
In honour of the half moon part
The tattoo scars, the backroom jaws
They say that it was too for real and that I rap too far
They say I shouldn’t shoot to kill and try to rap through y’all
If a Henny bottle could talk, it’d sing my last two bars
I’m the inner side of the raw, the middle part of the core
The base of what you was basing, you’re winning on from the door
The basement that got it shaking when it was bottles galore
‘nd breaking when they was breaking to get inside of the hall
I’m a park bench logo, foam posits and polo
‘em grey bottoms get three wears before we throw those
I’m made by the shit you would hear
So how the flow go?
Should all be accredited back to my [ ? ? ]
Back to the bar bettin’ it
Back to the start sketchin’ it
It sound like white GS rappin’ like Shawn said it (haha)
Or Avirex leathers and beepers like [ ? ? ? ]
For y’all motherfucker’s that don’t get it

[Chorus]
This is half moon part baby
Know who we are baby
We play the sound like we ain’t here with that bomb baby
No one ever minds to the shit that they regard baby
And if you ride just remember what we are baby

[Verse 2: Chuuwee]
Scarface the rapper did more than Scarface the movie for us of course
Cause bitches selling they souls to be married, pushing a Porsche
Mattress is by the window, sleeping out on the floor
I’m ghetto out on the porch, revisiting ’94
I’m slick as a southern pimp
When I spittin’ a couple bars
When I twist inside of the raw
When I’m giving it to all of y’all
I’m the dope from around the alley
I pitched it to get a car
A youngin’ whoring an onion
Just wishin’ to be a star
I’m southside stompin’ in gravel
Chasin’ my paper
Pimpin’ pistols, high stencil
This scripture got them in awe
Got it soundin’ like, Naughty by Nature
In Chuck Taylor’s
I’m the west coast [ ? ? ]
With this verbatim
Yes I are baby
Get in this car baby
Don’t try to play like you ain’t knew who who we are baby

[Chorus]
This is half moon part baby
Know who we are baby
We play the sound like we ain’t here with that bomb baby
No one ever minds to the shit that they regard baby
And if you ride just remember what we are baby

[Verse 3: Tayyib Ali]
Yeah I young but my hustle hard
As far as I can remember back
I’ve been fuckin’ raw
Livin’ in Philly man
No broken heart
No book of law
But it’s my time right now
So I sit back and take it all
In a pimp house
Spitting’s just the way I live
Just tryin’ make it big
Think ‘bout all the things I did
Half of y’all fakin’ to be
Whatever you say you is
Drink so much that I probably
Never see straight again, damn
I come alive when he turn on the mic
You heard of me right?
Verbally nice
Murder the hype
Irvin and Mike
Ball hard, never fall
Word to my life
Nigga’s come at you like water
Freeze up and turn into ice
But what’s life?
Cause that ain’t really
What I thought I take from it
Top spot that they wanted
Lack bidden’s that eight-hunnit
Far side y’all state runnin’
Visionary, my day comin’
You see me nigga?
They say somethin’
Ain’t no frontin’
I’m just straight stuntin’

[Chorus]
This is half moon part baby
Know who we are baby
We play the sound like we ain’t here with that bomb baby
No one ever minds to the shit that they regard baby
And if you ride just remember what we are baby
