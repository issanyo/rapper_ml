[Hook]
All day, always
All of us is for it
Ain't a song change
All the shit we saw is what we all became
And we all that we got 'long as the song plays

[Verse]
We hung out in front of the corner store
Got older and took it to the liquor store
Money low, so bet we wanted more
Only way we'll separate is how we pick the course
Of course we, know where we belong, we
Nowhere next to home but won't be long until we home, see
Know that when we home we putting on where they can all see
Know that they'll adore how we adorn so as long as we
Loaded up with cargo, whichever way the car go
The outcome's a murcielago
Mercy upon anyone feeling mercy at their heart tho
My outcome's a merciless God flow
God be with us, a R&B bitch is enough to inspire us
And we Dej Loaf for that loaf if they comfortable trying us
See?, baby it's easy to adapt to what you be around
Being next to A' is why my aim will never see the ground
Being next to Bro is why you know we all or nothing right?
Being next to Mel we never fell, we never cut the lights
Being next to Pesos
Was GQ and Bishop before their hiccups
Cause loyalty is nothing you can pay fo'
Love him like brother, that man there like my brother
And if it ever should come to it that man would let a K' go
So going for advancement is the root we would stand in
Scared of being dormant so, we grew with our hands in
Hands put together, all the prayers people sent us
Saying don't believe the hype, don't grow up to be a ni**er
Don't grow up and become a typical ni**er while you here
Like who you with every day, leave them ni**as over there
What?, damn, I feel funny even saying that
That word is foreign and my friends could never make me that
Duly noted if needed but know it never will
Easy to adapt when you around whatever's real
