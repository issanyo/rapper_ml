[Verse 1: Skzyoo]
Bigger stages to walk across
Brighter lights give way to the ambiance
Find the hype and if it stays then the all and all
Is by the lights and the persuading of the audience
Moments of the present, own it if you catch it
Few and far between but it's dope enough to stretch it
Moments of the present, own it and you rep it
Shoulder and the name got us holding up the leverage
Own it for a reason, right, long enough to see the sight
Picture what it be, what it means and what we be like
Driven through the seams and the scenes of the weaving mic
Be enough to be what they need to believe the flight

[Bridge]
Live for the moment, make sense don't it
Started where they did it, but we took it where we want it
Live for the moment, make sense don't it
Started where they did it, but we took it where we want it

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
I-I-I-I-I
Never felt so alive
Now we're touching the sky
Count them down till their over
Cause no one can hold us
So live for the moment

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Never blinded, 20/20 something better signage
Saw it out the corners when they wouldn't let us find it
On it for the corner and the sketching that's behind it
Bottles in the air if you ever need reminded
Celebrate confetti, if you ready then you catch me
And the streamers that precede us bout to lead us through the mezzi
The thought of what it couldn't be turned to what it shouldn't be
David Blaine lanes till it changed like "look at me"
Found away to make, came up with a story???
So whatever you play, I literally saw that
Hinges got to move, I brought it where the door at
Pause for the applause or whatever you call that

[Verse 3: Skzyoo]
Couldn't find a light bright enough
Fuck the scared, jump in here and live the life with us
One in the air, cut through there and get it right with us
Or feel the ceiling and at least live the night with us
Never knew the feeling
But bet if you could feel it
You would never forget it
You would let it do the steering
Never knew the feeling
But bet if you could feel it
You would never forget it
You would let it do the steering
