[Verse]
Theodore Aloysius Huxtable
Deleted the drums, so as we have begun
The content is raw enough to take the beat where you want
Amen to the speakers and the piece in the trunk
Understand both sides, shit I'm even from jump
Never blamed, I just leveled the lane
And took whatever remains
To push whatever you need to be done
Made 'em rep for where they wouldn't ever seem to be from
Let 'em play the car in back like a seat in the front
I saw it all with a Theo glare
Wrote my keynote here
In Dyslexic, reverse how I see those there
Cause for us, loud money couldn't be more clear
Chest poking, I mean we only repo scared
No backsies
Know what it took us to get to have these
Die before we give that time back, exactly
Rap be, sort of my way of becoming Clifford
And if he was still alive, my biggest fan would be Ennis
10 Stigwood living, tickets to Dance Mania
They hired working a textbook, fan framing us
Gee and Maxine Kirkwood to campaign with us
And Lana Herman, both of 'em sorta perfect
Became the kid with the vision that started blurring
And everyone around him and wit him was Carter working
So now I'm trying to feel my way around
In corner stores asking how it feel to take the crown
I was feeling weighted down and didn't know
Same gray bottoms started giving a bigger glow
I ain't ask for it, baby, I was just penning, yo
And saw a little room and was hoping to get a go

[Bridge] (x2)
Look what we have here
Look how it turnt out
Never saw it coming, I was just 'bout to turn 'round
Leave it up to me, and we'll be here for keeps
Crown us if you want, but we just here to eat

Look what we have here
