[Verse 1]
First of all I wann' thank my connect
Meaning I thank me for every part of my steps
Meaning I thank me for stepping off to the left
Mapquesting the rights but never followed the rest
Back under the lights, I never wanted the stress
But if that come with hype then that's one to impress
Trapped under the life since tagging under the desk
Couldn't tell me that I couldn't be matched up wit the best
Back then I wasn't, forward now I am
Back then I wanted to call it now what I can
Tapped in to wanting to come around in a Lam'
Off a story that you know like the other side of your hand
Meaning that you relate, and that should be enough
Couldn't name another that was accurate as such
Know I weave with the paint cinematically as such
OGs said I say it like when Acura's was up
'95 the diction, 20-20 the view
'95s edition of what was under the stoop
9.5, gifted, up and under your boo
Not a soul as nice so I don't want it with who?
Do remember that I'm the one with the proof
So if I do brag then I was up in that booth
No mic when I was up in that booth
Pinstripe suites, find me up on the 'Tube
I know Mike, MJ salute
Sharing the cigars with the pair that you got on
Tor' know, he was there to tag along
Lou Gehrig records, L&D sweatshirts
Same kid by the speakers when they blared
Moms with 2 jobs so my weekends disappeared
Heard high schoolers blowing reefer in the stairs
I was sitting in the kitchen, it was seeping under there
Banging on the table, scribbling a chorus
Ambition to get it and live it how I saw it
Bowls of Apple Jacks, youngin' me don't play
How the fuck could I ever not be ok?

[Hook]
Grew up on Kool aid
Money by the shoe lace
19, opened the trunk and sold 2-ways
Me and Biz for the win like touch√©
And spent it all at the mall every few days
