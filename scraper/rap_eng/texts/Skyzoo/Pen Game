[Intro]
I love money, I love money
You take a buck from me, you Doug Funnie
I said I love money, I love money
You take a buck from me, better duck dummy

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
With my man Skyzoo, it's the class clown of his high school
Drown you in typhoons, hittin' you with rhymes too
Haters keeps their eyes glued, pound if you my dude
We stay high like Einstein's IQ
And y'all muther fuckas know where I'm comin from
Chewin' cats up, like a little piece of bubble gum
Tryin double sum's, hustle, wanna let my money run
I ain't even battling dude, I'm having fun with it
Jokes make him feel wrong in his own skin
Sippin gin from a bin that's makin' my dome spin
And you the type that'd try to take from your own kin
Feel it close on your toes, hangin' by clothes pins
I'm spittin blades, God damn it, my tooth hurts
A mouth filled with a bunch of cancerous tumors
Yup, music's my baby, I ain't gonna lose her
So I stay with a radio, like Cuba Gooding Junior

[Hook] (x2)
Who you think could body me lyrically?
In the middle of Alaska I'll write a heater
My worst verse hot as your best rhyme, damn
The pen game insane

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
I'm one drink away from everything you meant to say
Like I think he on the rise of what the kings made
And in the blink of an eye I'm on the king's page
But no album, this is all for the mixtapes
In a different lane, no signs of road rage, cause ain't nobody over here to rage quit, so no gains
No sleep, no retreat, no surrender, no apologies from me
I'm the pen of the penners
I mean what I speak, so if I given you a sentence
Then it be's what it be's, nothing hit on the agenda
You leave it up to me, and you can divy up the team
Put your pride in the air and I'm dismembering your members
The heart of the city, the star point guard, that can play up to the fall
So the parts is all gone, no room on the bench
And I got a no trade clause, so I'm here, long haul, no switchin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Look, I rip mics to pieces, cook 'em or eat 'em raw
I was bustin' freestyles before I could read at all
MCs just call me the monster in their mind that haunt them all the time
And they thought if they could rhyme they could make the situation a lil different then the present
See, I fucked this track, worried that I got her pregnant
I'm haulin ass, y'all is whack, taking out the garbage, trash
Duckin' from these sharks and crabs, giving MCs heart attacks
Its yo' boy Mac, damn I'm great, and you gets, no love like a man with AIDS
I fill you dancin' gays with some hand grenades, drop bombs, remove your hands and legs
And I pray; dear Lord please give me the strength, not put these little snakes in their taint 'till they faint
Suffocating, now you choke, you a broke MC, now ain't nothing to do but smoke your weed like...

[Hook]
