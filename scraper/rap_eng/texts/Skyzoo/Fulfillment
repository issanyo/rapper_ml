[Verse 1]
No agenda like the present
How I presently be speaking
Ain't no wind in my direction
Where I put its where I put it
See its sitting where I left it
Got em' thinking loaded dice
How I'm sitting out here betting
If you in you know the price is
Good enough to not forget us
I come in they lower lights and
Send the one to where I'm stepping
If you in you know the type and
Everything that y'all expecting
Half '94 Nas
Half '97 Betha
Write dirty
Dress clean
Eat good
Travel better
Please women like we're married and
Rep The Wire forever
Buy cars all cash
No lease
No payments
Keep a Chris and a Snoop in close reach for arrangements
Keep a lawyer in the phone
Stash money for retainers
And my lawyer kinda bad
She'll fuck up an arraignment
Thank God only thing I have to call her for is contracts
Thank Him at His crib and then get back to where they toss at

For my fulfillment
Filling up a glass
While I'm filling up a wallet
And the feelings that's attached
Got me feeling like I got it
And this feeling if you ask
Is a feeling saying "we about it now" lets get it (ahh)

For my fulfillment
Filling up a glass
While I'm filling up a wallet
And the feelings that's attached

[Verse 2]
Word to being related to Sandra
But still dealings with bands
That be dealing with contra
I'm still giving the plans
To be in with that rasta
But I'm just trying to live in this mantra
And they made me the author
And I'm trying to count something and loft us
With spare closets for Nia Long's stuff
I still got plans
My dribble stupid
Yea I still got hands
And my corner is gentrified
But they still got vans
And cameras up on the light post
That blink if the light broke
And fully loaded's will roll up
And sing you the right notes
The song playing while you waiting trying to get a hand
Ducking in the elevator
"How I Could Just Kill A Man"
Q shit
Juice shit
Bishop off the roof shit
Singing Sky you got the juice now
So you sip
But it's all for Justine
And brownstones in Brooklyn Heights
And all we want is keys

[Hook]
