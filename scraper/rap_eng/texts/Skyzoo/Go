VERSE 1 (Evan)

We gotta book it, run it, get it we gotta go
Gotta get to another city, drop another flow upon a beat
Keep these people hoppin on they toes
I'm living with what was given this is not just what we chose like
All I know's what I ever knew
And I'm still the same, nothing's changed just a better view
And a few of the things I've been through done made it hard living
But I can still win the game when I play with the cards given
King I, Sky, Ev homie
Evident we better than your best so the rest is irrelevant
Certified fresh, double check you can tell that I'm cream of the crop
Served like fine dined etiquette
Man, it's all relative
Ya'll sound like you're too high off of sedatives
Me I'm too fly, two times what you'll ever live
Steady get it in, ya'll pencil in adrenaline, tellin em

HOOK
First thing you get it then you know
Yeah homie I'll be gone, onto the next show (Gotta go)
Gotta get it yeah, I'm on the road
I gotta go (gotta go yeah) 2x

VERSE 2 (Skyzoo)

Gotta go like the boys is coming all them toys is dumpin'
And them sirens is lightin up and the noise is hummin'
We was out knowin that we was poised to run it
Do remember we be them same boys who done it
Done it for real in the truest since
Never needed a hand to be moving with
Vowed to make you understand who we is
Or who we are, never who we were, promise we still the same if a pedestal occurred
Probably take the blame if they ever do complain
Tried to leave them a lane but they never knew the curves
Only one to know what they throwin and play through it
And leave here with the city with me like Ray Lewis
See I been on my I rap better than everybody
Since I was told that only a legend could ever rock me
And I was told that when I was workin on my regents
So that means that I was sixteenish, believe it
