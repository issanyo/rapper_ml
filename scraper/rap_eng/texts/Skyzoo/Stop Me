[Speech: Cres]
Ou, nothing can stop me
Yo, I´ve been doing this for half of my life
And even though this industry is bullshit
My passion for music is greater than ever
Goes something like this...

(Scratches)

[Verse 1: Cres]

I can´t describe this feeling I got, but something is in me
Real big, I feel it when I´m feeling you´re with me
I feel it when I write, when the beat´s tight, when I´m on-stage yo!!
I never lost the faith in me. (nope)
And never looked for fame
Just make a living outta what I love, that´s my claim
That´s me all day practicing on a loop
Like Ricky Rubio does his thing on a hoop;
So what you want from me? uh! I´m this, I´m that...
Shit, at least I am, you´re not
Been on the walls, on the floors, on a mic...yo hit like, dislike
But fuck it nothing alike Cres & !llmind...
Test the real vibes, yes he kills drums, best to build rhymes... Me!!
Against the world on my way to succeed...
Just drop the needle, hit me hard with the music´s everything I need...

(Scratches)

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]

Guess I was drawn into too much Mase
Mufuckas couldn't hold me, I'm true to that tape
You can blame a maxi single for who I became
Better believe I intrigued em to do what they say
Said I'm one of a cut few, one who can touch stoops
They was tryna follow I'm the one to adjust to
The wonderful just due
Did it for the spirit and that spirit had us living and in love wit what lust do
The irony of everything that it comes to
Came to it first like I'm slinging my nuts too
Pardon where I took it
Figured it was worth it and regardless how it's looking y'all arguably mistook it
So I explain whatever they want when it was cooking
And my next chain will prolly be my heart on top of Brooklyn
Love us for the grind, respect us for the night
Jump in front the lines, never saw a sight...
