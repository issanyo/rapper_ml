[Verse One] [Sha Stimuli]:
Look
I'm from the heart and soul of the city
The home of the Biggie's and Jiggas
Gang Starrs, gang scars, niggas get busy
The blocks hot and hip hop prolly saved me
Dodged problems from cops stoppin' and Glocks cockin'
Yo I gotta pop shit about my borough
We can go from rock choppin'
To flippin' that and investin' in stock options
Was born in the 'ville
Raised in the 'Bush
Put my name in the books as a legend
And now I'm eatin' like my face in the puss
I know you mad and you hatin' the Brook for doin' what you can't
I'm from the home of the Boot Camp
Where food stamps kept the hood fed, now you see us advance
Sometimes I hold down a corner with my feet in the stance
Like, "This is my block" prolly got the heat in my pants
We either go to work or holdin' work, I need a plan
So I took all of those that came before me
Put Brooklyn on my back, got the fame and glory
Change of stories
Switched the chapters, turned the page
Turn the age of 12 and burned the stage
From burnin' haze with homeboys to earnin' wages
For my boys, that's my word I'm stayin' in BK mothafucka

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Welcome to Bucktown U.S.A." - Boot Camp Clik 'Welcome To Bucktown U.S.A.'

"It is the place that I stay" - Mos Def 'Brooklyn'

"Welcome to Bucktown U.S.A."

"It is the place that I stay"
"Despite of who I am and where I'm from"

"Representin' B.K. to the fullest" - Notorious B.I.G. 'Kick In The Door'

[Verse Two] [Skyzoo]:
All rise for the 7-18 representer
Stay clean from December to November
Corner store Sky that's the moniker
Switch flows every four lines for the followers
Follow my lead
My zip code is give and go
From the borough where it's obviously
You bottle and move or bottle your dreams
I level the playing field, help 'em try to believe
If I'm a breath of fresh air then you aspire to breathe
Still hood like a dollar shot of Henny
And splittin' dime bags, put the five in the philly
Now holla if you with me
I tell 'em, "Move like it was two strikes"
Respirate the pen, I give it new life
Spit it how I see it
See how I send the word like I'm around back
The first one to ever hit the curb with a soundtrack
I Corner Store Classic'd all over the masses
Those is prerequisites, next fall is the classes

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Welcome to Bucktown U.S.A."
"Brooklyn"
"It is the place that I stay"
"Despite of who I am and where I'm from"
"I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born"
"Welcome to Bucktown U.S.A."
"Brooklyn"
"It is the place that I stay"
"Despite of who I am and where I'm from"
"I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born"
"Representin' B.K. to the fullest"

[Verse Three] [Sav Killz]:
The Crooklynites
Son we known for rockin' the mic
Besides tappin' pockets, gat cockin', niggas get right
Give me the limelight to invite, ignite
It's like a bomb site
The wack I terminate on sight
To revive survive son, that's only the strong
In these streets here, these cowards ain't live, get gone
Try to gentrify us, this is where we belong
Out of towners can't sell me shit this is where I was born
A resident
See it in my swag it's evident
The state that I rep I'm proud of it, never hesitant
Brooklyn body shit, hooligans we negligent
But now it's a renaissance, change for the betterment
A resurgence
On a rise back to prominence
We generate it now, regain the confidence
A lot of niggas had the chance but fell incompetent
Yeah, we the new niggas bringin' back the dominance

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Welcome to Bucktown U.S.A."
"Brooklyn"
"It is the place that I stay"
"Despite of who I am and where I'm from"
"I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born"
"Welcome to Bucktown U.S.A."
"Brooklyn"
"It is the place that I stay"
"Despite of who I am and where I'm from"
"I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born"
"Representin' B.K. to the fullest"
