[Intro]
Let's bump the headphones up a little bit more
More so the beat

[Hook]
Let's be real you don’t want no part of this
No buster no problem no arguments
There’s a lot of rappers out but the problem is
They aren't rocking like us they ain’t hard hitters
Let's be real you don’t want no part of this
No buster no problem no arguments
There’s a lot of rappers out but the problem is
They aren't rocking like us they ain’t hard hitters

[Verse 1]
It's like a motion picture flick depicting
Soldier as a victim of cold war on a mission and so forth
Rappers I worship sickle a nickle I roll called
Them niggers ain’t no sicker than the chicks that I wrote for
Two of them pistols is like insulin for diabetic
You missing them but you missing
The sympathy in trying getting this messes
I’ve invented is coated as the divinci code
Called together historically known as the invisible
Vintage role this ain't no part of decarted
You missed an invisible trail coat
Killer will be instural note there is no impulse
Murdering off of impulse hurting the hurtful insults
Suddenly when the feds broke
That's just off of impulse
How many renny and bonds
And where my mind sets lyrically
They consider me Johnny dept of the concepts
I John step a typical ranger bar sneakers size
Step ahead I broke a pack and there is
None better they keep in mind
And any wicked try he can die if he does the evil eye
Possibly the illest sound legally on the speaker why
And any time I receive and more speaker arrives
People on the streets they be screamin like we is legalize
Things be divided when the rhyming is a side effect
I make niggers crush the new records that they release
And I’m peaseded ain’t what I’m about got a microphone
At my mouth like an epileptic seizure see you

[Hook]
Let's be real you don’t want no part of this
No buster no problem no arguments
There’s a lot of rappers out but the problem is
They aren't rocking like us they ain’t hard hitters
Let's be real you don’t want no part of this
No buster no problem no arguments
There’s a lot of rappers out but the problem is
They aren't rocking like us they ain’t hard hitters

[Verse 2]
It's time to level up I’m in and out like a virgin
Trying to get a nut I’m a boss so none of ya’ll catching up
And now your career looking real bushy so please don’t push me
Or else I’ll get the clippers out and get some edging up
See i was born through the old school
I come to haunt when I stroll through
Outcomes beyond their predictions
Now when I keep shit I don’t really expect them to get shit
Talking about tough shit and they get shit like sky gets it
And I give them middle fingers and pipped it
Cause I’m still I’m still that dude
Shy did it again yea it was mine too
Yeah I speak that truth fuck it i told them no nuts no glory
I put my life in this notepad before me
But you can hate I just write you can ignore me
But all those that awate is going to applause me

[Hook]
Let's be real you don’t want no part of this
No buster no problem no arguments
There’s a lot of rappers out but the problem is
They aren't rocking like us they ain’t hard hitters
Let's be real you don’t want no part of this
No buster no problem no arguments
There’s a lot of rappers out but the problem is
They aren't rocking like us they ain’t hard hitters
