[Verse 1]
Infinitely caught in a weave of, 
Tryna dip around what they breed before you leave or, 
Climbing in and out of a scene they call elite or, 
Lining up whoever's between the world and me or, 
Me and the world, whichever first when pronouncing it, 
Taught us "get enough for us all if you come out with it", 
The background eat till it's gone if you all around with it, 
Tryna get a piece off the corner like quarter ouncing it, 
Caught up in the bounce of it, where loyalty is all that it oughta’ be
Like if I was to call and see if you down for it, 
Word to a dresser drawer burying what was found in it, 
Truly forever yours ever more if you doubted it, 
Ever more like more than you was ever surrounded with, 
To get involved makes you apart of the sound of it, 
No regret at the door and no announcing it, 
Fucking with whatever you about with it 

[Chorus]
Forever in a day, forever in a day, 
100 on the line, and never will it stray, 
100 on the line, and never will it stray, 
100 on the line, however we should aim
Forever in a day

[Verse 2]
Forever ever, forever ever, 
With short change measures, in all day leathers, 
And honor's like forever ever, forever ever, 
Your alibi know to keep it Andre clever, 
And being on mean we ignored what all they left us, 
And it starts out being as on as Rae Sremmurd, 
Bare minimum, the feeling of ceilings that never left us, 
But the chicken box will kick off the top for whatever weather, 
For the win of it, corner get loud, they caught wind of it, 
And everybody caught in the sound that you was whispering, 
Send something flying around to help them get in it, 
Or how that's still yours if your name ain't on the end of it, 
Loyalty is priceless, jewelry isn't, 
Give or take, depending on what type of jewelry you're given, 
In a space, where the script is stuck to like a pivot, 
If you knew us then you knew we was with it when it’s 
Forever in a day 

[Chorus]
Forever in a day, forever in a day, 
100 on the line, and never will it stray, 
100 on the line, and never will it stray, 
100 on the line, however we should aim
Forever in a day

[Verse 3]
Broad day like jumping out in the way 
When one is jumping up outta the front and finding it's aim, 
Or, divying a bag with who you're beside every day 
And splitting points like you dotted your name, 
'cause know that all of these green lives that used to be here, 
Matter like these black lives that these blue lives shoot outta fear, 
So all these green lives used over here, 
Was 'posed to set it where never would a second set of shooters appear, 
The first set is just the usual here, 
It makes sense as much as it kinda don't but that's new to who, where?, 
The prestige, of feeling like you're who they let breathe, 
Due to a bag that you shouldn't have, it just seems, 
Like more than they’re letting on to, 
Finger fucking money resorts to thinking that it adores you, 
Whatever you make of it, make it where it goes around with you, 
In light of where all these go arounds put you, forever in a day
