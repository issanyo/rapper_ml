One time up for Chi Ali
'Cause I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen
My mama prayed that I wouldn't be Chi Ali
Now my mama straight 'cause I wanted to be Chi Ali

They say my Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
And now that new thing got me riding out for whatever

One time up, sowing the sides up
Hometown heroes like you know where to find us
Looking over your shoulder like I'm slowing the ride up
First time listeners, they ain't know what a line was

Blue and orange everything, loaded the line up
Got 'em looking for lines like they hope they can tie up
A spoon full of 'ron when I shoot and give a bar
Give or take, I'm in a space that's usually regarded

For wakes or living aces, truthfully regardless
Look at who they telling me to par with
Pardon me though, bred different so I'm arguably so
You arguing over crowns dude arguably, no

I was fitted to wear that fitted and wear that living
For the living, you hear that penning? Well yeah, that did it
I mean it's all just as real as they say
And blame Chi if anybody is feeling a way, one time

One time up for Chi Ali
'Cause I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen
My mama prayed that I wouldn't be Chi Ali
Now my mama straight 'cause I wanted to be Chi Ali

They say my Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
And now that new thing got me riding out for whatever

Doing numbers, tryin' to do the summer
Dreaming outta control, said we tryin' to coupe the hummers
Leaning out of a hole like we tryin' to duck the edges
And leaving papi alone 'cause we out here running credit

Young, early 90's in the heart of the K
Saw the servers, corners had targets for days
Any reason is a go, how they squeezing you should know
Draped in Columbia jackets, beepers and Girbauds

I mean, played lockers wit tomorro's front pagers
White and purple huaraches, tryin' to murder the lobby
I mean all we knew is what we saw first
Wheels up for whatever 'til it all works

And I tell 'em one time up for Chi Ali
'Cause I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen
Gray basements on all of my fitteds, if I'm on then we did it
Applaud with it if you see my lead, one time

One time up for Chi Ali
'Cause I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen
My mama prayed that I wouldn't be Chi Ali
Now my mama straight 'cause I wanted to be Chi Ali

They say my Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
And now that new thing got me riding out for whatever
