[Verse 1]
Living better at the thought of living better
Living is carpe diem so I'm caught in this forever
The smell of YSL over teddy bear sweaters
Know when I got one on I never zip up my leather
Never did this to catch them, they wanted to catch me
Said I wrote like I have yet to know what a rap be
Meaning it's deeper than rap if you ask me
Or the subjects of the stories I told where the track be
Two classics and rolling on lap 3
My whip was 2 doors I drove from the back seat
I did it like who's y'all and know that on lap 3
I'm still clueless to y'all but I know where the track leads
Meaning all I see is lane and opportunity
Lil road kill, ID 'em by they jewelry
Know the flow still got 'em leaning out the coupe with me
Like "son, do you hear what he saying, I mean truthfully"
Truthfully I'm just waiting for this to pass
This 5 year plan that I gave 'em is in the bag
The bag got monograms on it if you ask
And a space jam glow if you open it and grab
Just a dude from Brooklyn who had intentions
Of hoping that Jay is watching and saying "Yeah, he gets it"
But hoping that Jay is watching is double edged and twisted
Like, "Yeah, I'm still a fan but now I'm within the business"
The blinders is on but I get the urge lift 'em
I peak and leave it there, I out-swerve collisions
My peak is still in there, I'm nowhere in reach of it
Yet I sound like its a throne here that I'm leaning in
Critics say that my destiny's that guy
I'm just here to tell a story, if I ever sit that high
Then I'm playing follow the leader, applaud that as a given
Like "I don't fuck with the nets but damn I fuck with his vision"
And I never been a follower but if I do follow
It'll be a 600 mill leader and a few bottles
My fan base is double knotted like an ascot
Half of 'em got degrees, half of 'em got stash spots
Half of 'em strip and half is contemplating
I see your vision mama
I put my money on the long shot, treat it like you Caine and Dog
With no prints to be rinsed and no names to recall
I mean, we out here in grind mode, caught up in a paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and front row the fade aways
Madison square
Or Barclays whenever the boys from Madison Square is passing thru there
I'm in a blue and orange state, its only apathy here
I was raised on them colors, Jigga, that should be fair
But I still lift my hat at the achievement
Only it's blue and orange letters where the team is
If we can get past that and between this, uh, then this baton will be easy for me to leave with
Floor seat, suede Timbs where my feets is
Raised on what he wrote and who my team is...

[Hook]
I'm tryna get these floor seats wit young
Prolly make me take my hat off cause my team just won
Videos wit Spike Lee and my sneaks is dumb
Records wit Jill Scott, and if you be where I'm from that means the world
