Better rides, new kicks, couple plans
Accessorized with toothpicks and rubber bands
Uniform true to form for how we was raised
Inspired to earn enough to buy us a day
And find us a way that nobody lead us to
And turn it all to green carpet like what's left to do?
Whatever's best for you
Seems to be what I pen so when I leave for my end just say I kept it true
But young enough to know that true ain't enough
When the ones that's even younger just really wanna become ya
And you still tryna become the legend that your neighbor was
Without leaving the same way that they laid him up
All hail and know that if all fails
At least we had a run and no one at all trailed
They wasn't close enough to call them that
The money they was spending is the money that bought them back
We just tryna get it, so when I'm recording that
Know that the theme is reoccurring until we see what they blurring
Singing 'bout where they were when they talk says where they weren't
Know I'm low key but my passport is concurrent
Appreciation at a level that it's never been
String sections for them reppin' who have yet to win
And winning has never been over rated
Lil' bit of worry forever is all it came with
Lil' bit of flurried confetti to show we made it
You know me, I show the parade and show the heinous
You know me, I'm on a wave that was created
By the thought of the waves under the boat where I'm waving
That's deeper than you ever could conceive
Do believe if they ever do believe
I gave them the reason to wanna handle that the way that they do
I'm stubborn like I was Marlo, but maybe I grew
So me changing for you, was mainly to be the one known
Its all a front, I wasn't made to play the son role
And believing you'll get out the way
Is nothing that I believe in as long as y'all breathing
And I promise the Greeks is cool with it
Them brief cases from me is what truly did it
We all run for the lead, shit, who didn't?
But ain't too many left that be speaking a truer sentence
Ticker tape parades in slow motion
Surrounded by the strings while they crowning us as kings
And on the sidewalk is the next you
So may the clock on your crown forever bless you
Sitting on the sidewalk is the next you
So may the clock on your crown forever bless you
