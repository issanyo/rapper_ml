[Hook 1: Skyzoo]
Swear that they up on it, know they in the fold
Tell 'em do believe, they with it from the go
Talkin' what it be, know they in the fold
Tell 'em do believe, they with it from the go

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Seeing is believing for whoever need a reason to
Grail looking holier the crown is looking feasible
Hands come together for whatever I can feed a few
Rap and turn water to moscato for a freak or two
Came up out the Nike box, thinking I just need a coup
Got it overnight and overnight my believers grew
Money took a savvy when they told us that it wouldn't
Tell em' I'm holding what they couldn't and they tracking where I'm leading you
Leader of the new school, built up in the old
So when you geeking off the new school, I give them what they throw
And I suppose when I mention that I get go what I be about
How I used to shoot out of text and bring a jeter out
Facts or however it go and you throwing hashtags
Act like you fit in the 'fore go get your gas mask
Hands on the lever, the will or the word
Either or, you seem unfaithful when I peels off the curb

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2: Skyzoo]
Yeah, but bet I make you a believer though (x4)

[Verse 2: Torae]
The second coming of dumbing is humming through your monitor
Momma named me Torae Carr never no moniker
Take my verses personal as Monica
Get you niggas life all week, thought it was Hanukkah
Blue yankee my Yamaka
Known to ride the rhythm like a Yamaha
Really wit' your bitty pop the clutch and then I'm popping her
Told you she a rider huh, that just means she's riding us
Metro car through the box, run the train, she riding bus
Who wanna collide with us? It's obviously obvious
The North won the civil war, it's better to side with us
McFadden & Whitehead; it ain't no stopping us
On the freeway with the mack that's state proppin' us
It's bleek, if I Jig and dash, it ain't no rocking us
Ready to die, sky's the limit, that Big Pop in us
Poetic justice got me the juice, now thatâ€™s Pac in us
Make you a believer, then lead you to mix a lot with us
