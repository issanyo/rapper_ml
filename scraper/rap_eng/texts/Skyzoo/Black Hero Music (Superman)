[Verse 1:]

In my uniform Starter jacket cape as old as my little brother
I came through that gate like no similar others
My brother 22 if that line went over you
You open up the trunk and you'll find where I through the stu'
I'm probably known to you
As 90% better
And neck and neck with the 10 that you covet but it's whatever
Whatever shoulda been said will be said when they start sayin'
Why they said it's over wet with the best of the bar cadence
But hey
We good though
As long as my hood know
And my hood in the loop like the part where the hooks go
The heart of a crook though
I see the facade
I do it for the Yout Dem like Onika Miraj
All I need is a charge
And a lane to be y'alls
But until it
I play the bullets that'll race through ya car
Until it
I sit and pull it if you breakin' they heart
And then you playin' dodge tryin to get away in ya Dodge
Double meaning
Want it and wanna be it
For the logo
And know yo that nothin' will between it
On the low though
I hand em' the real and call it even
For the dough yo
I plan to Darrelle
I'm on my Revis
Need us
We right there
Pronto wit it
I mean you ride for that ride
Play the Bronco wit it
Tell em spell it backwards and give us Harpo digits
And the broads from Tiatro to bring us Mambo chicken
D.C. waddup
Howard homecomings
Dope jumpin'
Flow feel like if ya throat runnin'
No dumbing
Did for mine from side to side
I'm to Brooklyn what Penny was to Memphis in '95
A walking Lyricists Lounge
All of this is the now
Meaning by tomorrow I bury this in the ground
Given the grammar in here I see we're unfamiliar
Shit is a family affair and we deeper than The Sylvers
I never had the back of my neck under nobody arm
Nobody helped I ain't here from nobody palm
Word to the critics and the women who tagged em'
My life is XL ratings and XL Magnums
In the spirits two Margarita shots
Pardon me but I been hot
Arguably I'm at the top
Part of me is for the block
Part of me is for the guap
All of me is what you cop
Carter me like it's The Roc
14 wit a flow
I was underneath the block
Thought Jadakiss was Jesus I just wanted to be The Lox
Fast forward to the now
Can't a soul see the jot
Or the scribe or the brushes or whatever I should drop
Mawfuckas can't touch em' you oven mitten the burners
While they callin' me the top three of the Brooklyn worders
Like
Big, Jay &; S-K
I give away the left lane
Anyone who feels differently you tell em' press play
"Great Debater" took 30 days to come up with
Sean Price said "It sound like you mad and Sky, I love it"
Fuck it
Penny Series
The first time did it
Otis Redding was resurrected when I work my pennin'
I'm just honestly approaching it
If I be over throwing it
The ladders by the tree for the Frisbee's that you can go and get
So you can go and get em' and...

Damn what happened to the beat?
(Yo that's the end of the beat)
Word?
Well fuck it
Penny Series
Black Hero Music
Week 3
Yea
And by the way that Black Milk beat is one of my favorite beats ever
So that's why it got tagged
Black waddup
Call me S-K-Y-Z-O-O
Yea
