[Hook]
Models is a given, know that off the look
But all we want is just some women who can cook
All we want is just some women who can cook
All we want is just some women who can cook
Walking round the kitchen
In your Vicki's get us hooked
Cause all we want is just some women who can cook
All we want is just some women who can cook
All we want is just some women who can cook

[Verse 1]
In the kitchen, stove clicking while you looking back
I'm looking too, I look at you like "let me cook in that"
I'm cutting thru while you working to put your foot in that
I bust a move and serve you like "where Brooklyn at?"
Right here baby, I'm right here baby
And your hand touching your stomach like "you right there baby"
Believe it, sucker for curves and knowing the way to keep a curve
So you dressing up a plate is like the sweetest word
Sing a couple tunes, the aroma hit the room
Like if you was K. Michelle how you bezerking with a spoon
Baby crazy at the stove top, oven door, dope spot
Snatching up a crown how you cut 'em off, close shop
Late night, early morning, sleepover benefits
If you can pull shrimp and grits, I'll be at your fingertips
Talking with your hands will have me listening for days
And tell your friends that all of my friends feel the same

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
From the K but my family from the country
A bowl of banana pudding is the dopest way to love me
You say I gave you the dopeness
I say I'm just whipping the way you whip at the stove and
Compliments in doses
Compliment the way that you was brought up by your mother
Like "fuck it I never met her but I love her, tell her I love her"
Telling you now how addicted we can both get
You strung off the long and me off of salmon croquettes
You be on your "Chopped", gourmet'ing off whatever
Then you head to planet fitness and you shave it off your measurements
Calling it sweet potato pie the way you let me in
And even though I can't fit it all, there ain't a better fit
Ha!, double meaning still around
Double up throughout the day, double seasoning your style
Baby talking with your hands will have me switching up your name
And tell your friends that all of my friends feel the same
