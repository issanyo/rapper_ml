[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Okay, the beat is telling me to slow flow y'all to death
And to speed it up when it's needed to
See what all your alligence do?
Now I'm here till we get through
Through with this money chasing
Till it's like the key to the safe is in the other safe
The safe bet is to place bets on the one they champion
Champion hoodies was the safest haven for Ambien
The ambiance got at the core of upper management
They say to go and find your applause and get your handle in it
My handle Jay Crawford, you grand your bay a day
I find Bey and wind up in Bey apartment
You hug up on your woman and she smells sorta Givenchy
You laid on her cause she laid on me
Word to Patterson
The hybrid of the decade, the first one to be traced
The nastiest of Nas, the most murderous of Ma$e
Pose for the close up and the words along the way
Rolled on the rollers not a burglar is safe
F.G.R. Ha

[Verse 2: Torae]
Preem hit the horn like, "Holmes I need me a [?]
Bars In The Booth and I bet you bring 'em a body
Told 'em 'Tore the truth." And I wouldn't tempt 'em to try me
Leave 'em lacerated and leaking and laying in the lobby
Alliteration my hobby
Words come together like the Scrabble board
One dice is a die, wanna gamble Lord?
Worldstar can record
And if they told you I was ratchet
Cause it twerk back and reverse after I clap it
Every session I rap in is a wrap
Write a record and then run it back
Lost chips off the Knicks, gassed off Stack
'Melo came and doubled it back
Til we put a banner in the rafters
I'm just gonna take it out on your rappers
I bet you pray 'fore I chip
Cop it, chop it and flip
You watch it, jock it and rip
Prolly hop off my dick
We all from the ghetto
The only difference is we go back
Barrell Brothers, Headquarterz, on this Primo track
Bars In The Booth
