[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Ok, let it be known
They want none as far as letters is blown
Under handle with the grammar, tell them catching a row
Wanna tamper with the scramble, I sever the load
My MO is bigger watches and heavier stones
Said it’s fly guy etiquette, you know it probably
Scroll through my followers, Hublot follows me
I’m posted in the bottom of the drums where it’s written at
It’s like I’m lining up the dumbs when it’s kicking back
Catch homies on a hum where the kick is at
Right there, now signal the light stare
I been in the right chair, my literals quite clear
I’m literally a Jordan 4 with a Nike Air
The Cochise of my Kooley High
Been on that forever just as long as you’re true to buy
Tell them I’m true to mine
Muthafuckers couldn’t salute a rhyme
And not recognize our borderlines
Let it be known

[Chorus: Tab-One]
It ain’t no faking over here, uh huh
I said it ain’t no faking over here
So we keep making what you want, uh huh
And keep that freshness pumping in your ear
It ain’t no faking over here, uh huh
I said it ain’t no fronting over here
So we keep making what you want, uh huh
And keep that freshness pumping in your ear

[Verse 2: Tab-One]
I’m energized to [?]
And improvise anytime they want to enter lies
I analyse their inner minds, just them mine
And send a rhyme concealing a certain [?]
Feeling fine, two axes, in align
Sitting with a friend of mine riffin’ about the different crime
Perpetrated by impersonating certified
Real rappers when you’re really just a certain kind
Of false, fabricated, phony ass, fake fuck
Fronting like a transformer forming as a Ford truck
Put four bucks of fuel in the tour bus
To rule it for two months and come back for a tune up
Two trucks, 50-50 grind, got a shifty mind
One half New York, other half Caroline
Ten years in this, spitting since the pair of 9s
Making it apparent now apparently I’m very nice

[Verse 3: Charlie Smarts]
My habit is grabbing all the tracks, it’s a package I’m unwrapping
You act like Fred and Ben, savages
The flow is immaculate, you got the odour of a catheter
You pull it out your ass and scratch and sniff, eww
Fuck, whatever’s coming after this
If we continue, y’all gonna have to quit
Why you mad at them? I’m feeling excellent
Like Bill and Ted, spend most my time travelling
You can’t calculate the math of this
But yours easy, it’s just average
The captain of the Mavericks is going down for sheez
Does it happen on a chair lift? No, it skis
We flow with ease, you trash like Tramp and them
You young chap stick to the script like ashy lips
What we hear kind of queer like fashion tips
So we trying to raise it up, I need a blacker fist

[Chorus: Tab-One]
It ain’t no faking over here, uh huh
I said it ain’t no faking over here
So we keep making what you want, uh huh
And keep that freshness pumping in your ear
It ain’t no faking over here, uh huh
I said it ain’t no fronting over here
So we keep making what you want, uh huh
And keep that freshness pumping in your ear
