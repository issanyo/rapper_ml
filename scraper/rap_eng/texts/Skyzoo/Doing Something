[Verse 1]
Me and mine was just tryna make something outta this
Braille on the blueprint, stencil out the design of it
Parallel to whoever you with with is how you aligning it
The truck is even flyer if we the ones that's inside of it
They said the inside of your crib is how you come out of it
So jumping off the steps ain't a threat to who you was following
My man said he just know what he know, and shit is fine
As long as when he hit rewind that he got a big enough pot for it
Said that he straight drop with it
I saw the proof in it, 5's can turn to an A5 if you in a groove with it
Dance all on the root of it, step on the motive
And crowns coming with rounds is shit that they never told us
They said to see any further won't help you get any closer
But still it's 20/20, drilling who's coming for me
Pegs all on the back of my goose was how I grew
You rode then?, then you ride now, know how we do, like fuck it

[Chorus]
Me and A' was just tryna make something outta this
Me and Bro was just tryna make something outta this
Me and Steph was just tryna make something outta this
Me and Paesoes was just tryna make something outta this right?
Me and A' was just tryna make something outta this
Me and Bro was just tryna make something outta this
Me and Steph was just tryna make something outta this
Me and Paesoes was just tryna make something outta this right?

[Verse 2]
And Nyce too, maybe more so than everyone
More than I would've thought that anyone could've ever done
5 stars out of a basement, they couldn't level us
'cause you don't know what forever means until forever comes
And you don't know when forever leaves until forevers' done
But we don't gotta never say never, there's no bezel up
Ain't too many left here to breathe can stand next to us
Make sense that they got the seats if we forever up
From day one it was theme music for peddlers
And bitches buying loosies, weaves tucked in a Doobie
Queens under their Doobies, here off of pay phones
Im here til the jakes roll and I leave before they shoot me
They never leave from around us
Time took its place and they remembered Larry Davis and made a Kalief Browder
Pegs all on the back of my goose was how I grew
You rode then?, then you ride now, know how we do, like fuck it

[Chorus]
Me and Nyce was just tryna make something outta this
Me and Ant was just tryna make something outta this
Me and Bizkit was just tryna make something outta this
And can't nobody get to it how we made something outta this right?
Me and Nyce was just tryna make something outta this
Me and Ant was just tryna make something outta this
Me and Bizkit was just tryna make something outta this
And can't nobody get to it how we made something outta this right?

[Outro]
Or how we wasn't even supposed to be here
Said it's too high for us to breathe here
Now look how we here
Couldn't pay mu'fuckas to leave here
But my Mongoose's here if we need here, forever ever
Or how we wasn't even supposed to be here
Said it's too high for us to breathe here
Now look how we here
Couldn't pay mu'fuckas to leave here
But my Mongoose's here if we need here, forever ever
