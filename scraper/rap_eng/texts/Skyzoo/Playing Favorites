[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
The scene set for you to kill the room
Blowing kisses while you hitting everything that move
Murder when attention seems to get to you
My attention all that matters til it's getting thru
Thru to what I need most, usually what I keep close
Close enough to where you knew it like if we home
Told that I be stretching, we can see how far my reach go
Then I can reload, uh, and hit repeat mode
Pardon, I'm just a fan of better moments
And sitting with this bottle's where I stand to let you know it
Truth by the shot glass, handle what I'm throwing
And catching Avion got you handing me your phone and
I proceed before I leave like "she got me where she want me"
But a win is for the win, winning lotto ticket money
Going for it in your message saying we gonn' see
And how your coat still smells like Givenchy and that you love it

[Hook: Christon Gray]
Baby I just want the time to show you how
I can be your favorite kind throughout the crowd
Cause we steady chasing
And we were playing favorites
And we became one

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Told you what it'd be like, and what you should expect
It all came to you off the rip, no regrets
They ask you if you good, you think of how I rep
And your eyes get wide, you ain't dealing with your ex
Cause you know how I rep, your crew start to notice it
Seen it in your step, my name all over it
Same rules apply, you see it all up mine
So when we step as a pair, every pair step aside
Reason to believe whoever I used to be
Is aside with them steps, say bye to who they seen
Say hi to knowing me, and hi to who you be
Cause being in the now is the high that you need
And product is the key, and you know nothing added to me
No steps, no pageant for me
So tell 'em all I do is rap and serve, like imagine how I serve
You see how I was flowing on my last cd

[Hook]

[Bridge: Christon Gray]
Your favorite one
Your favorite one
Your favorite one
Your favorite one

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
The moment you find what you wasn't looking for
But soon as you got it can you never put it back
Built off the juggle I know the worth of a double
Your hands work with the double and you let the money stack
Same rules apply, you see it all up in mine
They're one in the same kind I just handle the react
Do it how you do it I promise you I ain't moving
I knew it before I knew it, I forever wanted that

[Hook + Bridge]
