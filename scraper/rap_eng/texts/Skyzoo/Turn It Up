[Verse 1]
Can't do what I does
The dude did it, been abusing the drums
When it's done, you won't believe what fiends do for a dub
I don't even get a chance to mix it without the handle it's twitchin'
Nose drippin', while they planning they fixes
Listen, I'm way deeper than that shit that you speak
And your so-called classics, I could pen in a week
But I ain't conceited
I'm all on the cocky side
With bitches leavin' the crib, doing the knock-kneed slide
What you know about it?
Homie, you slip with your girl, and I could show her 'bout it
I make your next top model do a show about it
And make a neo-soul broad write a poem about it
I'm from the land of the burner, so I don't roll without it
The borough with blue steel
Where times times changed, so now I'm sittin' on the stoop kills
But still, I'm that dude controlling the cabbage
And I don't got a bank card, just a hole in the mattress

[Hook]
Now turn it up
You gotta have your speakers bleedin'
Burnin' the highway, and then your Jeep is leanin'
Turn it up
Thirty-five cents, with intents
Twistin' that good piff, you in the hood bitch
Turn it up
Keep that system knockin'
Truck rattlin' hard, 'til the fender droppin'
Turn it up
What? Turn it up a little bit
Turn it up
What? Turn it up a little bit

[Verse 2]
I'm here to handle my business
Shit is easy I'm expanding the limits
In the throne, on the low, while I'm plantin' my pivot
I'm on the creep, creep
Plottin' on the seat that's open
You hear that beep beep, y'all better proceed to floatin'
My name heavy in your speakers, the dude got love
If I ran a race in the dark, I couldn't lose my buzz
See the flow is like cocaine sprinkled with propane
Gettin' straight down to the roots like Rogaine
I beg for anybody to differ
Try hollerin' back, and see how many won't be hollerin' witchya
When Skyzoo slide through, ain't a team comin' near him
Couldn't see me if we were standing between double mirrors
I lowered the bar to try helping you
And you still couldn't kiss my feet if you stood on 10 pedestals
The new breed who got somethin' to say
Flow flawless, and keep a bad slut on her way

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now put your hands together
For the dude that they call the crowd favorite
I'll breathe on the beat, and they callin' the foul flagrant
The savior of this game and I'm proud to say it
You got a song to prove me wrong? You can proudly play it
I speak bold, 'cause I speak from my left tit
And fuck the past, my motto is you're as good as your next hit
So fuck what your crew made
Y'all better get that Hennessy outta your veins and replace that shit with Kool Aid
Dudes try they hardest to sound hood
I threw a couple G's on my neck, and I don't say that to sound good
I say it cause it's true, homie
Please believe I mean it when I say I'm that dude
Homie, my name S-K-Y-Z-O-O
Run with the Justus League, who want it with we?
Not a soul on God's green
Whoever try to fuck with the God team, I promise you gon' feel that palm thing

[Hook]
