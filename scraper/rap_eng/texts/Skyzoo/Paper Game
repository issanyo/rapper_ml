[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
My day one motto I keep that, close enough for me to reach that
Stand on what I plan on, my hands on, my seat back
My camp on, I needs that, FGR my brainchild
Group of guys that I move beside and like 2 for 5s our name loud
Loud enough but still low enough, where you don't gotta know what I'm holding up
Just know that I'm still holding mine, golden pride, golden nuts
Golden jewels, right from birth, all or nothing, might could work
Rap about how they trapped us out and y'all ask about like it's a Bible verse
But I'm still on my pay now, counting up on my way out
Sweetest sound is that bill pluck, well after me and what I lays down
Down for all that I know, just say the word and I go
I map out and then black out, I take that route ‘cause I'm grown
And I done seen too many mistakes from trying to get your shit straight
So we dress up like we been full, but frame of mind like we skipped plates
I wake up, kick a prayer, contemplate on what Skip say
And then get back to this bread run, sucks for y'all and your distaste

[Hook: Accent]
They won’t take who I am away
In this paper game
Cause one day I'll get a raise, I'll get a raise
But I'll always stay the same, I'll stay the same

They won’t take who I am away
In this paper game
Cause one day I'll get a raise, I'll get a raise
But I'll always stay the same, I'll stay the same now

[Verse 2: Accent]
Who I am is never gon’ change, whether for fame, women, or dames
If it’s gold chains, fifths of rosé or bricks of cocaine, whatever no thing
Could dishevel my name when I better my pay, I’ll be setting my pace so just get out my way
I could get along great putting pen on my page, if there’s bread on my plate, and some edamame
My soul ain’t to sell even if it exists, so go somewhere else I don’t need to be rich
To smoke a pair Ls if my nose deemed fit, or boast a bare self and hopefully feed kids
Know it’s fair or healthy that most people’d pick, cozy’s where we’ll be if only seen a tenth
Of what all millionaires held over years since they wrote and shared tales and stories of greediness
Don’t get me wrong I need money and a good amount, but I wouldn’t want or seek none that I couldn’t count
Scribble on sheets humming what is from my mouth, and always honestly fluffers ought to cut it out
But it’s hard to be someone if you struggle now ‘cause you gotta own green coming to another pile
I performed in streets once for the funds around, and I was poor but cheap cups stopped the stomach growls
Cash won’t dull my identity, my passion or vulnerability
Towards that of a lulled intensity or a lack of what pulls my energy
From the back of my skull through the wind I breathe, I won’t crash my hull into anything
My knap sack full, trying to live my dreams, but a stack’d be cool ‘cause my rent ain’t free

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kinetics]
They put an eye on the pyramid, pyramid on the dollar
I'm peerin' at all them dollars, but spiritually I'm hollow
And we all wanna make our list bigger, ready to die like ditch diggers
No soul like stick figures, fixated on six figures
Checks on your Chase, you got checks on your Uptowns
With Chucks on, so chicks frown when they check you out and they look down
Is it materialistic? Is it a limit edition you bought?
Or are you just merely a mirror of images, and you're not really artistic at all?
All of this paper chasin' traces anciently
Face it, basically back to nations based on basic masonry
Even the Bible told you, the profit is honorary, stop with the commentary
Just stop at depositories, and pocket the monetary
Walk to the monastery, repent
Light the Dalai Lama's Nag Champa, that's burnin' Dalai's incense
Hence, yo life is a bitch, file divorce
As long as you handle the child support, remember to smile in court...'Netics!

[Hook]
