One time like

SK

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Back home with a crown on
King me if you sing me when you think of me now on
Know when the sound on I rap like the ground gone
And good monclers protect me from my downfall
I go outta town they say "sky we can tell
Your whole aura's the purple tape and you ride it for real"
I say I'm riding the rails that I was holding when I was watching them own it
And now on them same rails is where I'm probably posted
Know I'm obviously molded by what I saw, and what I'm on made me everything
That you've come across
So jumping on is fully understood, in comme des gar√ßon
My hoodie up for good, I mean how could you not follow?
Survive by the block motto of getting it how you live
Applied it to every pair that I wear when I'm by your wiz
Young, and tryna win like they told us we wasn't built to
Aiming at your theory thru my rear view, drinks all around

[Verse 2: Larue]
Young leader refer to me as a Bonaparte
Iron your team tie in some jeans I am Tony Starks
Make em holla soprano
My words got weight feel like I'm dropping an anvil
Give em an Advil and a dose of that substance
We livin in a country where there ain't no justice for the black skin
I try to keep my feelins patched in but lately feel like we can't win
Eff votin and taxes
Came from nothin heat the house from the oven
Roaches crawl in the cupboard but we wasn't sad for nothin
We had dreams champagne and limousines
Black bow tie offshore in the Philippines
Escape the guillotine and on pursuit
Selling on the track like a prostitute
Identify me threat when I prosecute my aim's
To achieve the impossible I'll do any obstacle
They watching 'Rue and I ain't mad at em bro
I tell em tune in and peep out my reality show
I appear when the clarity's gone with street melody poems
Miller Harris cologne set it in stone
I got this we started out microscopic
Now they open doors no keys like a locksmith
Indeed I'm the prophet my team run to Boston
Looking at you haters in my rearview
Drinks all around
