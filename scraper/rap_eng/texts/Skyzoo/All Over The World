[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Yeah!
Like this, ain't nobody sick as the dude
So they don't want to see me get in my groove
Nahh!
I'm six feet, and ya'll looking mini-niscule
So the minute that I get in the mood, you're through!
I'm that dude, I came in the game to change shit
From the bass lines, to the slanguage
Just listen to the way that I make shit
The corner is mine, the co-signer dried up on the pavement
You see that? They tried to scrape it off
Can you believe that?
Shit is embedded for real, and I be that
The City's Favorite, I told them on the last one
Motherfuckers running round like they ain't have one
But ten thousand out the gate means you probably
Did
And you was probably trying to cop to live
Dude, I'm number two
White and blue with the delivery
Larenz Tate with the versatility
And it's like

[HOOK: Skyzoo]
Like this, all over the world
Rock with us
Like this, all over the world
Rock with us
Up top, where you at?
Down bottom, where you at?
Left side, where you at?
Right side, where you at?
Like this, all over the world
Rock with us

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Yo!
It's M Phazes on the bounce
And I switch and change it when it counts
You can hear me weaving through the snare
Similar to if a bad breezy is in here
I hang ten and we out
Trim be looking for me, I don't be looking for trim
I just ride around shining, like Pusha and them
And pull a ski-O, who look like she's Siamese
With New New
Swallow me whole, and say it tastes like Yoo-hoo
Woo!
Pardon me, but that just the shit that I be's on
And if you don't like it, then breeze Pa
But I still be on my block shit
Sunflower seeds by the boxes
Switch up top shit
It's something harder, similar to the Carter
Not the President, but the building where
They was moving product
And it's evident when I'm dipping
I'm dipping something proper
With a Paula Patton lookalike
I'm on my Brooklyn aight

[HOOK: Skyzoo]
Like this, all over the world
Rock with us
Like this, all over the world
Rock with us
Up top, where you at?
Down bottom, where you at?
Left side, where you at?
Right side, where you at?
Like this, all over the world
Rock with us

[Outro: Skyzoo]
It's M Phazes on the bounce
And I switch and change it when it counts
ESS KAY
It's M Phazes on the bounce
And I switch and change it when it counts
And they call me S-K-Y-Z-O-O
