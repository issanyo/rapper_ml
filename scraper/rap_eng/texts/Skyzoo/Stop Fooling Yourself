Feels somethin' like
[Repeat 3x]
I solemnly swear
What I perform in the booth
All of it is truth

Goes somethin like this

[Verse 1]
Uh, to whoever it may concern
If you listenin', I'm lookin' for a place to turn
See it seems like, this is all I want out of life
But it's the other way around, I wanna do right
But it's moreso a question of responsibilities
So the lights stay on, but my conscience is killin' me
Gettin' my Mariano on, pitcher perfect
Still inside, I fear the Lord like "is it worth it?"
Huh, at first I say "no"
But when I open my closet, it makes say so - fuck it
And this is hustler haven, see I'm not alone
Cause he would say that I got faith, or I got a home
So I ask God if he still love us
I don't always wanna be this drug dealin' ma'fucker but
I was playin' on, with opposite plans
And I ain't even have the decency to wash my hands

[Hook]
So he spoke through the clouds like

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

I said nevermind the mistakes, and he said

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

I said I'm tryin' to get through them gates, and he said

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

I said I'm tryin' to switch my ways, and he said

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

[Verse 2]
Searchin' for a way out of the bottom
Without shootin' the 3, or tryin' to serve product
I'm really just tryin' ta defy the odds
A 9 to 5 is callin' me, but I'm tryin' ta dodge
I really wanna do the school thing
The so called not cool thing
Cause I'm gettin' tired of movin' things
So maybe Howard or Morehouse or Clark-Atlanta
But all of my friends peddle crack and spark hammers
I told em we could still be hood and do somethin' more
Wit our lives
And they all look surprised like
"Wasn't you the same ma'fucker?"
"That showed us how to cook up and cut the butter?"
I said "yeah but I guess I sort of had an epiphany"
"I'm tryin' to take this ride, and ya'll don't wanna
Trip wit me?"
Got into NC Central and I was glad
I ripped my acceptance letter in half

[Hook]
Cause my dudes kept tellin' me

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

Tried to change my grind and they replied

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

I said "you changed wit time," and they was dyin' like

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

So I changed my mind, and stayed outside like

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

[Bridge]
They say you are what you are, and you been what you been
Played the corner so long, I blend with the wind
Mind over matter
Money from the grind is a factor
Tryin' to get it wit mines gon' matter
You are what you are, and you been what you been
Played the corner so long, I blend with the wind
Mind over matter
Money from the grind is a factor
Tryin' to get it wit mines gon' matter

[Hook]
Cause everything else is really like

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

I'm playin' tug 'o war wit myself like

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

Cause if I try to call for some help it's like

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

Scared to go to the Lord for help like

[Sample]
Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop

So I just say fuck it

[Repeat 3x]
I solemnly swear
What I perform in the booth
All of it is truth

Goes somethin' like
