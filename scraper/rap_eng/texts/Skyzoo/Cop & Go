[Hook] [Skyzoo]:
It's call a cop and go
Get it while it's hot, hit the block and roll
You know
We call it cop and go
Endin' up spot on the dot, quick fast with the stroll
We call it cop and go
And whatever you need you get it through papi on the low
We call it cop and go
And whatever you need you get it through papi at the sto'

[Verse] [Sha Stimuli]:
Where else can you get a bag of chips, can of beans, bag of white, bag of green
Loaf of bread, pack of cheese, loaded gun, magazine?
Right there on the corner
You can go and get work, I ain't talkin' 'bout employment
Nah, some shit for your enjoyment
Around my way, either papi or Islamics
Workin' 24 hours, sellin' snacks in they pajamas
I can show up at 4:00 in the morning
The store with the auwning is lit like Christmas
I pull out my wishlist
Pack of Magnums, Tropicana, pint of Guinness, Arm & Hammer
Papi let me get a free soda with a turkey sandwich
I don't drink soda but my boy like's coke
I don't support his habit, but fuck it
If I can grab it at the bodega wholesale, I'd be retarded
If I don't cop it, it's the ghetto ass version of Target
It's like
Wal-Mart, without the lines or the long carts or the debit cards
Get it soft you can get it hard

We call it cop and go
And whatever you need you get it from papi at the sto'
