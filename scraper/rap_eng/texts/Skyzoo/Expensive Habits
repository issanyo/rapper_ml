[Intro]
Ha, yea
I mean, just looking at you
I kinda feel like you got expensive habits
Well me too ma

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
So why not make it where you be busy
And your friends gettin' used to that
You lookin' at me like damn what I would do that with that
Ya steps sayin Louis this, Gucci that
You wear ya money like me huh
True to that
You addicted to all them expensive purses
But all that you puttin' in them
Makes all them expenses worth it
Like puttin' my number in it
And holdin' it till you learn it
Ya iPod loaded with all of my vintage verses
Well I can offer you all that you been deservin'
And baby I'm as honest as all of my literature is
If you really a fan then you know how my literature gets
With the moral being I'm giving you bigger purpose
Like you was nervous
But it was worth it
Shows over for whoever
Shit is curtains
And when you learned it
And it was perfect
Trynna explain but can't find where the words is

[Hook: Jesse Boykins III]
I can see you like it lavish
Designer eyes, imported fabrics
Look no more I'll match ya talent
Girl for sure we lust for magic
C'mon c'mon c'mon
I'll be your expensive habit
Let's turn this lust to magic
Baby yea

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
BBM days and Pino nights
Spare kicks under the bed
I'mma leave those Mike's
Baby fly guy etiquette
We know life
Tell ya girls anything
Tell em' "he go right"
If they asking
Tell em' that everything you imagined
Was done on the first so the second was more added
Lyrics come to life
You lay and become a addict
Keep ya Jimmy Choo's on
Yea ya glasses
You been all about that
Knew that if you drought that
I can flood gate it and awaken what's around that
I can runway what you playin' where the crowds at
I can one-take it like I'm makin' you the soundtrack
You can turn serenade
Next door hear the play
Melo in the mourn
Turn it up and let them hear the game
Drown that up under you
Surround sound cover you
And this is a Bose
So you can sing how you wanna boo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
The perfect playlist
Could call out the day shift
You need a day to get back in touch with ya basics
You a Morris and all that you went away with
Is comin' back to you now fuck it embrace it
And when you hold it
You fiendin' to let me know it
Lookin' for reasons like you really need a motive
At 7:25
You wake up and touch ya thigh
Like "Damn it's still shkain'"
Well baby I'm not surprised
Ya know

[Bridge: Jesse Boykins III]
Baby I'll take care of you
And sho' you right
Baby I'll take care of you
And sho' you right

[Hook]

[Outro: Skyzoo]

Wassup wit' you
