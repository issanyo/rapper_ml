[Intro: Tuffy of Channel Live]
All these weak rappers steady makin' hits, fuck that
But '94 I bring the skills back

[Verse 1: Hex One]
Eyo I'm verbally quick active surgeon when I serve you these clips
Equip 'em with third degree murder insert and we split
Thirty of these dirty worthless turtle hermits we rip
That's word to me clique furtively spurt a verse and we spit
The burner we grip I bet you herbies heard that we sick
Since birth to being burped my words will be slick
Working with emergency shit I'll murk you making Mercury slip
Out of its orbit reroute it toward the Earth and we dip
My shit's immaculate my steel is harder than a statue is
Giving you chills, the skills that I'm harboring is cancerous
Whenever spilling these lyrics a brick is what I smack you with
So fast you have to get a slow motion camera to capture it what
Son I spit 'til I fade back to blackness
Slaying them wack cats playing the back lacking practice kid
Spraying like MACs laying the facts hatless
The praying mantis still we kill you with rip tactics
Fuck the wackness caps get smashed to ashes
Madness show no pity slaughtering your captains
Niggas so shitty on their tracklist my witty flows
Could put your whole city under water like Atlantis son
So could you manage? Nah, we do damage
My crew is savage like two spanish Bruce Banners dog
Yo with this mic apparatus I move planets
So challenge my school the tool is brandish

[Chorus: Hex One]
Eyo peace yea some of y'all nice but the rest peep the steeze
I get blood on my mic when I press these MCs
We be keeping it real that's how we feel what the deal
Oh you think you got skill? Y'all not ill son
Eyo peace yea some of y'all nice but the rest peep the steeze
I get blood on my mic when I press these MCs
We be keeping it real that's how we feel what the deal
Oh you think you got skill? Y'all not ill son

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Elitist no pardon me it's
More so fuck out the way when I barge me in
They said they rarely saw five stars on a repeat
Let alone a three-peat 'til I part three'd it
If seeing is believing then the scales I be in
Is tracing out the blatant and you Braille ID it
Visionary riches like a record of mine
And how I step on rewind became the trails y'all needed
No step on the vine no trails of a remix
Just everything you came for tucked in a safe or
Tucked in a Goyard humming while the plane board
A verse from me is that dressed in a Bape store
Made more between giving rebuttals
And becoming Carter Slade and ghost penning for others
I'm dope dripped in a puddle on a spoon
Recovering the bloom with your top five jumping out the room

[Chorus: Hex One]
Eyo peace yea some of y'all nice but the rest peep the steeze
I get blood on my mic when I press these MCs
We be keeping it real that's how we feel what the deal
Oh you think you got skill? Y'all not ill son
Eyo peace yea some of y'all nice but the rest peep the steeze
I get blood on my mic when I press these MCs
We be keeping it real that's how we feel what the deal
Oh you think you got skill? Y'all not ill son
Eyo peace yea some of y'all nice but the rest peep the steeze
I get blood on my mic when I press these MCs
We be keeping it real that's how we feel what the deal
Oh you think you got skill? Y'all not ill son
Eyo peace yea some of y'all nice but the rest peep the steeze
I get blood on my mic when I press these MCs
We be keeping it real that's how we feel what the deal
Oh you think you got skill? Y'all not ill son

[Outro: Hex One]
Nah, another image out of infinite. Yea, so what the deal? Hexagon. The reflective perspective logical thought shit. What? Word up
