[Intro]
On the strength of the success
The moment you remembering has left
On the strength of the success
And being a success nonetheless
For whatever was left
I mean for whatever was left
Them right turns turn left

[Verse 1]
If I would let the beat tell it
All the derailing
That was sitting under this is all you keep hearing
But if the words kick it
And I word different
Then ill be overflowing these until the words missing
Say I be overflowing speech so any word given
Is me going for the reach till my nerves kick in
And then its back to what I’m comfy with
Back to what I understand
Back to where it jump again
Back to going underhand
And anything that that entails
Catch the tail end of this
And you’ll be playing Kit to TaleSspin with this
‘til they fear remembering
Pretend that it ain’t made you yet
Higher For Hire through Cape Suzette
It’s like I made two lefts and saw the third comin’
I’m back to the fourth bar, got my nerves jumpin’
I let the words run it
Follow those like it’s a @ sign there
Trying to close where gap rise here
It feels like inheritance

[Hook]
And when the feeling subsides
Do remember how it feels to be high
When feeling that rise
Like me and mine and for every bit of that side
Do remember how it feels to be high
Said it feels like inheritance…

[Verse 2]
That’s why I’m watching everyone who watches me on stage
I feel confused I can’t feel whose feelings changed
But still pursue these anvils, I feel aflame
And this pursuit got my standing still and feel I lame
I feel away but only say as much as I
Can assume you would understands what undermine
And this mood got me dusting hands with other sides
I’m in bloom but in front of plans with cutting eyes
To no surprise I know I’m wanting mine, but still I search
You get it young and shit is sprung that image works
Shit’ll get worse buying coupes at 19
But still jumping by the ledge
Watching Juice was watching me
But muthafuck a Radames
I was Q minus the Technics
The stoop tried to connect me
My mother saw me dreaming but my scheming is what blessed me
So lets see, assume we tug and war for what the check be
I’m comfortable apart from where the rest be
Feels like inheritance

[Hook]

[Outro]
On the strength of the success
The moment you remembering has left
On the strength of the success
And being a success nonetheless
For whatever was left
I mean for whatever was left
Them right turns turn left
