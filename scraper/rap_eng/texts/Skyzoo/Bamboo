[Intro]
My man said that he bamboo on the steps
Tell him what you can or can't do for a tech
My man said that he bamboo on the steps
Tell him what you can or can't do for a tech

[Verse 1]
And he said, the strap black like fab 5 apparel
Sweet 16 running laps outta the barrel
Said it sing lullabies that'll wrap you like a carol
Ducking that is like juggling laps with a Camaro
Counting turns into weighing when there's a market
Both sides of it just came in here for a target
One got a bottle awaiting covered in sparklers
The other got a dot, a aim, and a full cartridge
Empty that and your rep will jump out the room
Word of mouth, murder out, connecting you like a loop
Put your name in the lights or whatever you might assume
Til your rep's so high that your weapon done got a groove
Said the purchase as sweet as Amel Larrieux is
Strip something down with the bow, no cupids
Both hands on makes it easy for you to shoot with
Hands up will tell you you need it before you through with

[Chorus]
My man said that he bamboo on the steps
Tell him what you can or can't do for a tech
My man said that he bamboo on the steps
One by one, hand in hand with his connect
My man said that he bamboo on the steps
Tell him what you can or can't do for a tech
My man said that he bamboo on the steps
Every 24 he done ran thru what was left

[Verse 2]
My man said that he bamboo by the benches
Hand you a coveted handle for the trenches
Custi' said there's beef in the scramble with his business
Copped one, blammed duke and it ran duke out his senses
Clientele spreads everything but his name
Even getting yelp reviews, shit is insane
The lane he was carving brought him one even wider
Roofless, drop jeeps and 645'ers
Ruthless, Eric and Jerry Heller conspirers
Like we gonn' get this loot up and won't a rumor divide us
Joints laid out in the trunk look like a line up
Ask how they got to the K, to no surprises
Dude wholesaling looks nothing like you and I but
You need son to get thru the door with no colliding
Funny thing about it you look inside of his ride and
He had a make America great hat on the side of him
Typical, clearing out the visuals
You walking with a Panther or here for residuals?
He said that they don't make 'em in the Stuy or the D or the Chi
But believe if they flying Ima sling a few


[Outro]
