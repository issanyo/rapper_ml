[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Playing middle ground, hoping this middle counts
And if don't, hoping I can keep my middle down
Fingering triggers at a dream if they sniff one out
Guess this aroma's gonn' kill me now, any how
Any means, catching finish lines in a quicker reach
Yves Saint Laurent helped em get to get me
We just made it all and it's all just the centerpiece
Playing middle ground like if this is what it gets to be
Being that we on, tryna be on one
They might add another by the time that we all done
I be saying we cuz if its me its all us
I be saying me cuz if its we its all hush
I did it off of lust, until they fell in love
Hustle from the heart, whatever be your drug
And then you realize if they never let you run
You'd be right where you was tryna be beside from the jump
And then you realize

[Hook: Jared Evan]
I've realized
That I feel like
I'm so blind
Til I'm on my own
And I realize
That this seems like
The only way to go
Tonight

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Its underneath you when you looking up
Never concerned cuz you never had to look for trust
Left it to burn when you left it for that look of love
Until your hustle unhook a plug
More than a hustle if every word that I uttered
Was for the better of us like nothing could ever cut us
Whatever could become us, was waiting past aim
Good stadium numbers, famous last name
Seated in a dream but playing musical chairs
And seeing who you be just gave proof to me there
The proof in is the air, you was who you was 'fore I got there
Hope your last name don't drop there
In it for the win til its said and done, laced up to let it run
Spraining ACL's, more steps to come
And then you realize if they never let you run
You'd be right where you was tryna be beside from the jump
And then you realize

[Hook]

[Bridge: Skyzoo]
Fingering triggers at a dream if they sniff one out
Guess this aroma's gonn' kill me now
Anyhow, still I'm down, for whatever be
Always said I'll stay awake if I ever dream
