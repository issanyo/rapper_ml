[Intro]
Yo
What up kid
2009 shit right here
Back out the bing son
Uh
Feels real nice
Let's do this (Spark it)
Yeah yeah
Woo

[Verse 1]
Yo
This pain ain't nothing I feel
Than what I felt when I was selling out
Out on the strip, crack dealt
The knocks rolled, chicks yelped, my momma said help
Judge hit me with a two-to-four
My life got shelfed
Back out the bing now, doing for self
My seeds want daddy back, that's why daddy pack
Baby mom screams like she's all that
Give her stacks she (?)
Like I sold drugs now I do rap
Hood rich, do rag
Too bad, you mad
Still my pen pop off
Two pass, my crew move (?)
Golden ass
Golden glass
Something could get stolen real fast
Niggas who be holding cash
Hood rich, quick go get masks
Fly whips, drove 'em and crashed
And honeys is all that
Ride poles and laugh

[Hook]
We hood rich now
We hood rich now
We hood rich now
We hood rich now
We hood rich now
We hood rich now
Uh

[Verse 2]
Coordinate
Get my life straight
Don't exaggerate
Meditate
Stretch the weight
Step in the gate
Kept in they face
Slept in their state
Cappachino the great
Get cake, get chicks
Get bricks, get new kicks
I don't play tricks its hood rich
Cut a nigga if he ever should snitch
Honeys, love 'em good and thick
We give 'em good stick
This the hood shit
The floss and the royalty, love and all this
How you call this
Me and my baby mothers veggies and all fish
(?) on all gifts
Tough drugs, tough hugs, tough lugs
And can't nobody do it like us 'cause

[Hook]
We hood rich now
We hood rich now
We hood rich now
We hood rich now
We hood rich now
We hood rich now
Uh
