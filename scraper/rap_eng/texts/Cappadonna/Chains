[Verse: Cappadonna]
Chains
Yo
I got anger in my feet
Eggs in my rice
I got a tough life
I was busted way more than twice
I see low but I don't play with the dice
Triple on the mic nigga fuck you
Whip you on this mic
Nigga stuck you
Fabulous clothes, fabulous hoes
Keep away from the so and sos
Nigga bless you
85  snake eyes guys
Last seen eating spiced hamburgers and fries
Murderous
Chase the observers
My verbage is slang pros
Hold back the Maz
While I'm puffing my reefers
Mamacitas, yeah my (?) want to holla
We seen pigs in a black impala
Reefer falling out of the window
Like a fucking rain shower
I knew those niggas over there
Would straight cower
Height is the tower
The game is Mayflower
Mad honeys under my power
Staten Island
The Dutch red wrapped around the sour
Smoke flowing out the top of the bower
Chicks go hard
We push raps for hours
The world is ours
We get it in where they don't allow us
Now drink cow piss nigga
