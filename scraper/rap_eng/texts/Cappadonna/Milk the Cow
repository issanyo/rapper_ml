[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
Let us milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW
One culture, return of the track slasher
Double doser, Cappadonna broadcaster
Strivin for perfection, the only way I got
My life back was through investin, devotion
Movin my soul toward the skit, vocabulary
Comin out my ass like shit, to feed my babies
I gotta fight y'all MC's, this money
Be gettin me high just like cheese in these tracks
I milk for all my childhood, make me feel good
So I keep on writin meditatin in the ghetto
Makin love waitin for lost minds to settle
Then I speak out, because we all need the guidance
Deep down inside us where you could define science
My mother told me, when I was so stressed out
"All you gotta do is just put your best out"
And I did it, milky
Milk this cow (2X)
Milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW!

[Chorus: Method Man]
Hold your own nigga, Razor Sharp with the art
Don't gettin blown nigga, throwin darts at the charts
Danger Zone nigga, Cappadonna
You know the stee' potnah, Wu-Tang death before dishonor - what?

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Yo, new Cappadonna is about to exhale kid
Hold all the phone calls, stop all the mail
Cappadonna raise hell, speak and I broke the shells
Seen brothers that fell when I slipped
I had my alibi tight that night, up in the Hill chillin
Y'all'll get shot, move away things are too hot
Look at my spot now, friends are exiled from close distance
I flow persistence, every time I step up, I rip reps up
Ku Klux, my words swing around like numchucks
This ain't for big bucks, never can quit this rap shit
It feeds my seeds, I can barely breathe
But y'all cats better believe keep off, the darts are soft
While I throw these missiles, at your skin tissue
You can't escape I absorb, gigantic crowds all aboard
Watch out for shitty fraud, my darts slam like doors
Makin it hard for you to get yours, selfish

[Interlude: Cappadonna] (x2)
Milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW!

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro: Method Man]
Bad birds that fuck nerds! *inhaling*
Hah! *inhaling*
Suck a dick up til ya hiccup motherfuckers!
The swarm continues, Wu-Tang Killer Beez
Cappadonna Cappucino, the Donna-mite
Came to treat your earpiece right
Y'all better recognize and realize
Hot Nixon, playin my position, bitch!

*gunfight*
