[Intro: Drastic Measures #1 (Cappadonna)]
Yo Cap, put down that blunt son
Yo God, speak on them corpses God
(Vanglorious, Cappadonna, worldwide vocabulary groceries
1996, before bio-chips, protect ya forehead and ya hand
Third world society, Cappachino, forever
Drastic Measures) Flip me some of that old Wu-Gambino

[Cappadonna]
I politic, anti-dustic, Donna take drastic
I smashed it, wack rap niggas, we open caskets
Too many crossed, picture me lost, I roll with more force
My resume', top secret, deep like CIA
The whole area +Under Siege+, my slang is bugged out with steez
It's the attack of new era rap, Cappa stay strapped
Park Hill forever, plus Orlando on the same map
My man look, don't eat pork kid, danger like New York kid
RZ' bomb, Jay bomb tracks from on a pyramid
Drastic Measur-nation, the world classic legislation
Third world order, third world cyber creation

[Chorus 3X]
"True to the game" "Donna take drastic" -] Cappadonna (3X)
"Initials untammed for you and your crew.."
"Drastic.."

[Drastic Measures #2]
Wiz was poor, the scream, so ya need to wait
Dial-tone, ya hate, but, they become ya face
Makes, contemplate, checkmate, it's too late
Got, quick lock, crime time, slot box, too
Who knew, that the Drastic crew and Cappadonna-Wu
Would have rappers call in sick like they had the flu?
UPS barcode that'll bass box moves
Foes and hoes knows the Drastic rules
But no, it don't hold, the productivity still flows
Strick full calls at the man at the stands
Wannabe jacks at hand but ain't nothin at hand
They rockin, pop-lockin, stoppin all competitors from talkin
My Glock slot won't stop 'til I reach the top
That's my mot' hot when my pot lock off the rock

[Chorus]

[Drastic Measures #2]
Number one, I'm the hot star rasta hiphopster
Wealthy rock star eatin pasta
I work that crack off by mantaining my posture
Pleasureable heterosexual asexual individual
Too busy thinkin about openin up fat ass resta-views
Slicin up silly suckers with violent gimmick tricks
I'm doin backflips, Van Damme kicks and plummets
Like roundhouse, hut, hut, hut, huh, Duece Biggalo
Upside ya head, out goes ya tooth
Spit out and shut up, cuz once ya broke I really get loose
I'm rackin wack rappers on Belgian benches so check it out
Featherweight, I press that booty up like a record
Yea, I don't mean to talk about 9 Glocks
Cuz you can't MC like I MC, how I MC
Who am I? The original, more corrupt
I'm just the man shinin new lights on ya brain
New school with a twist, yo true to the game

[Chorus]

[Outro: Cappadonna]
Maintainin, politicin, Drastic style
Comin with that street slang mentality
You know what time it is, Drastic.. kid..
