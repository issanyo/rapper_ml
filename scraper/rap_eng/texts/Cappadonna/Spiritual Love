[Intro:]
Riddim me a culture ya’ll

[Sample of spiritual love Chorus]
Where my homeboys and homegirls?
You already know

[Verse 1:] [Cappadonna]
You don’t have to be at the studio
Just to let the verse out
That spiritual love in your heart
Just let it burst out
Spiritual love let the mice in the church out
It’s the feeling that you get
When you grow up on the right route
For the trials is what you know
Life is all about
Forgiveness overcomes sins
And hell will hold town
That’s why imma hold it down
For all the people that are still loving
Come around
Wishing the best for ‘em
Never want them on the ground
Staten island, worldwide
Put aside your pride
Killing hate shit
No more black on black crime
Focus on the present
And leave the past behind
Dig deep inside yourself
And you’re sure to find
Find your spiritual love
Self and mankind

[Verse 2:] [Amar Divine]
Look how long we’ve been striving and growing
Look at life compared to what you knowing
We see the facts son
We the chosen
Children of the most high god
Who could oppose him
Which emotion here
Could ever elevate
To the critical control
A nigga separate
This is spiritual love
That we reciprocate
One god, one life, one truth
Eliminate confusion
It’s what the devil like to do
See i’m a soldier in the army of god
I rebuke him with the power that’s invested
We manifest it
We couldn’t stop it even if you could arrest it
Ma niggas poppin on the corner light refreshments
Get back into the crib and [?] for their assessments, huh
Could be the best shit a nigga ever cop
And ain't no violence in the verse
And so we make them buss a shot [blap]

[Spiritual love sample]

[Verse 3:] [Nakeeba Amaniyea]
Seh well the most high will guide and protect them
Deliver weee
They try a ting but no quiver or shiver
Reverse situation
Damn near the damnation
Being hurt in my bases
Can’t leave the plantation
You see
Blatantly fragrantly
Outdo your agents
Disgusting, you must think my people are vagrant
Empty you tempt me
Relentless for centuries
Repentance, my vengeance
Is promised to [?] zeen
I read your messages
Make your
Spit with diversity
None of that before rap
Cold rap assume that
Spiritually healing
Catch those feelings
Exposing the dealings
Pride for the biblical
Flows criticals
Spit fire
Brought you to my burp
Umbilical
Bun captivity
Baptism lyrical
True salvation is spiritual
Amaniyea

[Spiritual love]
