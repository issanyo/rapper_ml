[Verse 1: U-God]
I live life lavish and my chain is karats
The last name on the train to Paris
Used to be lame then attained the merit
So many clothes can't name the fabrics
Dynamics, I want the fame
And my name engraved in granites
Here's his lane, now came to grab it
You moving sideways, change your habits
Used to rock minks, then I changed to rabbit
From out the garbage, I came from average
Used to be righteous that changed to savage
Bang my ratchet like Bangkok Dangerous
36 Chamber fist Trianglist
Watch me mangle this Star Spanglist
Rock cowboy Wrangler creating mega-hits
I'm from the grain Game at my fingertips

[Break: Cappadonna]
Yeah! Killa Hill lay it down!
Killa Bees on the swarm!
Nigga

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Ayyo I plow down ? like I'm out for revenge
Fuck it, it seems like the drama never ends
Be in the projects like I never left out
Might be on Osgood, see a nigga stretched out
I can't take it seems like my hood is cursed
Bad niggas, I thought that the good was first
My old whore, she march with a foul parade
Don't learn shit til another child is sprayed
I'm out here, fuck it, like I live on ? and Rico
Keep a low cut like Margie
I don't give a fuck, y'all made me bitter
I'ma whip your kids out like a babysitter
I'ma grown man but I'm young in the mind state
Live in every borough but New York my tri-state
Test me you know I brought a bitch on the tour bus
Pour piss on you, leave you stuck for 4 months
My head fucked up, I'm off my clean streak
Don't make me pick the 9's up, I come from mean streets
My unit snitched on me, ratted me out
They all ganged up on me, tried to take my mouth
However the cause I'm in jail and get bent
They cut from dirty cloth, I'm cut from cement
Original [?], got the crazy glow
Them devils tried to jump me, I'm crazy though
Absolut Vodka rat crush mad Goose
O.G. all day like I be on the deuce
Pop off with it, get your army in order
Staten Africa, Islam, across that water

[Verse 3: Bronze Nazareth]
Yeah; Told 'em "Have Gun--Will travel"
Blowing earth metals, black son spill gravel
Bronze Man oblong javelins in my cabinet
Detroit cement salutations from the missile plant
Quick to the hollow point, it ain't no olive branch
My low-cal 4 0 cal. in the cardigan
Tempted by Satan put a bullet in his diaphragm
Walk around black clouds and quiet violins
A tire fire blends poet and violent pens
Illest skill, got steel plots and iron winds
Uphill need a ghetto spill, the sirens sing
Street dreams. black season, inspired kings
For fire water veins, still rain Listerine
They chains through to my "Roots", no doubt Ben Verne
On the road to riches and diamond speech
I might turn a bag of white sand in mountain peaks

[Verse 4: RZA]
I don't text to send messages
My testosterone stimulate her estrogen
Whether Black, Caucasian or the Mexican
Asian, she get the message and she coming back for sex again
Organic drugs
My natural persuasion
You under the influence of 36 invasion
Spider-man amazing but I'm darker then Parker
Skin got abrasions from Arya and Tasha
Sliding down the street cold
Pull up to your party stimulated with a Jeep full
Of jerry gap honeys and bottles of vodka
Plus the weed rolls, here we go
Mediating, never jealous, over zealous
Wu Tang's my fellowship
Fans mash up accapellas of our lyrics with Beatle tracks embellishes
The idea clearly that Wu-Tang forever
This way of life is art, rhymes and cleverness
Joined by God no man can sever this
I complete jobs free and effortless
Use tiger crane, snake style plus the leopard fist
