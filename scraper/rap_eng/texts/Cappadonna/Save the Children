[Intro: Cappadonna]
Whateva, whateva man
I'm here to represent G-O-D to the fullest
I got a message man, and the message is straighten up
Or get eatin up

[Culture]
All mighty God is with us (2X)

[Chorus 2X: Cappadonna ]
Save the children, these streets is like a villain
Life is like a chop shop inside of the buildin
Save the children, these streets is like a villain
Save the children, let the blood stop spillin

[Cappadonna]
Roses are red, violets are blue, this life is about me and you
Not the red, white and the untrue, together we stand
Divided we stand tall, final call, God save us all from the gates of Hell
Where my young family dwell, it was a tall well
While we still suffer, days are gettin tougher
Jake on the prowl, treatin people on the street foul
Some of them mean well, but they all live behind the shell
Kick my door down, without ringin my bell
Claim I'm sellin crack, but I ain't doin that
All I do is rap, I'm a real MC, trynna get my life back
Devils'll make it difficult, there it glow within the cult
Can't wait to cut my throat, cuz of how I speak
Too black for Hot 97, last year they put me on hold
But I still went gold, where the joy go?
What happened to the +Black Boy+ video?
Bring +Run+ back, y'all scared of Cap
Sleepwalkers can't roll wit the blacks

[Chorus 1.5X]

[Culture]
See the man dem him, he went from nice to true drunko
Now me speak the truth and a man just a den dead
Wit the children, when I told you I be on the outside
I can't trust with him, not pity on the outside
I'm hung it with him, tell him that I carry
Tell dem save the children
You sold your bread, I sold my bread
So ya meet my new friend, Mr. Up-On-The-Ten
Then are ready to bust, let me load again
And the play gon sting, just like stealth bomber
Refuel the jet, because me loose me venom
Jewels we do, and refuse not to sin
And when I come hotter, don't work for Jah
Hittin though we gettin, well that's the word is dark
Brother gettin children, some lovin the hard

[Chorus 2X]

[Culture]
A mighty God is with us

[Cappadonna]
Intelligent minds, encounters of the third kind
Trapped behind enemy lines, youth life on the line
Devils keepin us blind if it wasn't for Divine
Contracts wouldn't be signed, save the children
It's like a chop shop inside the buildin
No second guessin, I'm confessin
In the club females are undressin
Little ones with the sexual affection need correction too
For too many years, shippin us upstate
Plantin drugs on us, the children ain't safe
Broke down our families, then they build gates
Sow holes in our brain like life is an earthquake
Stole our language so we couldn't meditate
Even in the schools where the teachers taught hate
Falsify history, everythin is fake
Use your third eye when you dealin with snakes
Let freedom ring, Born Love Allah, see the king
Save the children is the song I sing
While I'm layin in the struggle absorbin the sun rays
Holdin the children in the last days
We're livin like slaves, modern day style
Save the children, make em cry for me now
Save the children, make em cry for me now

[Outro: Culture]
Cry for me now, no sight killin
Yagga yaw, them try kill me now
Yagga yaw, dem cry for me now
Save the children, Dem cry for me now
Ya all pigs, you nah
You ya, yea yea, God is with us
Bad man nah know, cry for me now, blaow!

[Skit Outro: Cappadonna (?)]
Yo, man, I ain't got nothin to say to ya niggas, man
Word up, just get the album or get the fuck lost
(Be like, fuck it I'm done)
Yeah, (God bless, good night)
