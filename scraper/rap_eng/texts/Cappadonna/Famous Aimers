[Intro:]
Yeah
Just puff something man
Get my mind right
From all of these crazy hood dreams
Yo eh yo now come’on

[Verse 1:] [Cappadonna]
Master of Ceremony
I hate being around fake niggas
That’s mad phoney
Chicks ride the pony
Me and amar eat veggies
Its still boney
Most of the times I step in the spot
And niggas know me
I roll blunts
And I be smoking just like a roly poly
Alakazam, sham taught me not to eat ham
Bam bam up in the hood nobody eats spam
Alot of dimes and money
Fast as I can
Tax invasion tryna stop me from cashin in
We superstars in the game
Dangerous men
Whores don’t really like me
But they fuck me again
Money chaser
Hope my lawyer beat the fucking case up
Pop off
Blast at everything until we make up
In the back of the car
On the dark route
Two indian chicks that like dark cock
I keep a [?] on my jock
Just like my name [?]

[Verse 2:] [Amar Divine]
I play the game by the old school rules
You can rap the microphone if you don’t pay no dues
And the rhymes so simple but you so confused
Got nothing going for you but your lyrics is hook
Yo, stay garbage, no pay homage
Hip hop wasn’t designed for that nonsense
We here to regulate
Come out of conflicts
Told ya’ll realness so get ya’ll the knowledge (c’mon)
Make you rap better
Elevate the [?] level
Compete the guards and things
Throw some patron [?]
Form shit outta nothin’
I’m saying get cheddar
Home of 400 or more
But ya’ll don’t know better
It’s a science to the study, to the t
Success is nothing but the generation they achieve
So i’m weaving like the shoalin monk
From woo jing
[?]
Of any other mc

[Verse 3:] [Don Shae]
I can turn a hard block into a soft one
Internet can turn a hard rock into a broadband
[?] turn a hard rock into live round
Enemies, birds, hard shots that flaw ya
Hennessy and herb, hard shots and [?]
White bentley azure
Hard top like a milestone
Im a monster like kanye and nikki
Shit get like concreate when don shae hit the city
Cause i’m an older dude
I’m old school
I can show proof
To my young boys
How to blow through moves
Man I learned alot
Never burned a rock
Selling night
Burn the block
But never burned the pot
Burning spot 12 12s
How you burn the spot
Murder plots
12 shells at the murder spot
I never heard of op
He never earned a spot
Turn this top convertible drop
When I [?]

[Verse 4:] [PMD]
My flow is so cold like Chicago
I know it all slow
But p’s never off
Always on soul
Pay attention when I check back in
Snappin neck again
Business never personal
From long island to shoalin
Bring it back to the fish in the hat
And banging tracks
When it come to globetrotting
Been there, done that
Raising the cheech and chong
Doing a 100 meters on the autobond
Once again its on
Its the hip hop overlord
Overseeing the source
Birth the hiphop act
From the land of the lost
Screaming boss
Pmd still come with the force
Transmitting through satellites
How I stay on course
