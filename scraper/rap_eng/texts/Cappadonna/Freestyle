Aiyo, I'm all fucked up, like them niggas in the struggle be
I look good on the outside, but got dust in me
I'm vexed, I spent all my life in the projects
You could never know what's next
Even though I rap, I could still go broke
Rob and sell coke
Doing life for catching a body, ain't no joke
Fuck dope, nigga, I used to sell crack
I hate to be like that, but it's real like that
I got locked up mad times in the Hill
I been to Fishscale, Mohawk, Sing-Sing
El Mira, Shock Two
So if you feel like me fuck me, then fuck you
Yeah...
