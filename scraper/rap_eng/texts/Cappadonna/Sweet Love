[Intro: Streetlife]
Excuse me gorgeous..

[Verse 1: Streetlife]
Just maxing, looking for hoes, y'know, relaxing
Met this redbone Jasmine, midtown Manhattan
Shot a verb, that tranked her nerves, calm words
Massaged the mentals, made her pussycat purr
Sweet Love you look miraculous, brown-eyed passionate
High cheek-boned, Tommy Girl cologne you smashing it
Jump in, take a spin, destination Staten
I have you home by ten, shorty started laughing
She replied, "Street, you ever ride while you drive?"
I looked puzzled, and said, "Nah baby why?"
She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up
Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up
Now I'm deep in it, flying past the speed limit
Out of control, still whipping it, steadily hitting it
Deep stroking, one hand on the wheel, blunt smoking
Loving how it feel, sweet Love you got me open, what?

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Love is love, love, love is love, love
Love is love, love, love is love, love
We connected like a train from the first ordeal
I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real
But like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants
I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, "Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?"
I said, "Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band
Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man?
Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can
Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub"
Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love

[Verse 3: Method Man]
It's a full moon, we in the bedroom
Thoughts consumed by the passion
Slow jam tunes and body action
My finger's on the clit splashing
Your pussy lips got you spazzing
Love juices, marinating in your satins
Sexy ass, I gets em like my old dad I love my women bad
With just a little touch of class
You'se the star by far, look at you ma
Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you cherchez la femme
Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up
But the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
We talk without sayin nuttin'
You told me if I came through you'd gimme som'thin'
Now we locking ass, pulling hair and talking trash
How you like it, slow or fast?
She said, "I like it when it last"
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea
Candidate for H.I.V, you'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're 'bout to bust damn it
Sugar walls coming down, now you can't stand it
You've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Getting closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
