[Intro: Cappadonna + sample]
Yeah, man, the fire is the purification
I spit ("Fire")
Energy.. no matter what happen, yo, I gotta spit ("Fire")
Uh oh, and I'mma do it for the team, yo, I'mma spit ("Fire")

[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
Aiyo, I spit fire at you dudes until the die I retire
I'm doing this for my family, so that we can transpire
And reach limits that exceed doubt, yeah we can do this
But we gotta get up off this murder route
I'm on the block, momma love on the couch
And the pain is unbearable, the way streets keep steering you
In the wrong direction, I'mma need more thugs around you and more protection
And you still guessing, you don't know what life is about yet
I study and work hard for the set, I'm proud to be a doc
I'm not done, my mouth's like a tech, women wit me in the stretch
And the five burns from the way a man rep
Fire that'll burn at a man chest, energy that

[Hook: Cappadonna + sample + Masta Killa]
I spit ("Fire")
You know I spit ("Fire")
I spit ("Fire")
You know I spit fire

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
I'm sweet flowing river, mathematics be the wisdom
Compound and we elements of sound, transmitted
Through the system of engineering
Technology allows me to transform
Words to sight, light is written
In five hundred seconds, since bitten and recited
A million black men united, from Shaolin
Medina heard the warrior call, we were everywhere
Already cocked and ready, one thought blew 'em off the planet
He can't stand it, head rocking, stadium shit
You know the champion, multiple armed subjects
Revolutionary techniques, please don't disrespect the projects
This is for the babies, and I don't want to have
Get ignorant and clap you
For nothing, we suppose to be brother and I other than self
It's the best part that sparks all things
Fire is in heavy rotation, all saying

[Hook: Cappadonna + sample + Masta Killa + together]
I spit ("Fire")
You know we spit—
—Fire
You know we spit fire
You know we spit fire

[Outro: Cappadonna]
