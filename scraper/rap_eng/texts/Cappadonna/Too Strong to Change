[Manchild]
Push the panic button, pull the plug nickel
Any rapper laughs about us make a thug giggle
Take a pick, pretty oenny shine swiftly
Spit it in a minute until the piggybank's empty
Atlanta need a title, let's call Mark Rifkey
Underground king like Pimp C
If I'm wrong, convince me
I'm considered a first in twenty entries
High on living life so I don't need your sense
Many men popping pills, feeling sickly
Trying to battle me with a bull pin back committee
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, ti's easy to fall behind
Starey eyed, slap a hand cock on the dotted line
It's not a game, but we all got bits to play
The Price Is Right for Whose Line Is It Anyway?
Anyday is your time to shine pal
Everybody's waiting to find out, find out

[Hook 2X: Manchild]
We see beyond the rain
We might be gone today
Can't be too strong to change
Can't be too strong to change

[Manchild]
Wide open, excelerator is pinned down
Devestate the champ, when I went the decision of ten rounds
Scratch out, we knock em out in a minute flat
Inify the pulse with a concentration of killing rap
Steal your heart and than give it back
Put some teeth in the love, sew it up with a big DUST gorilla track
Then Cappadonna got some fire to breathe
Slow burn desire push up your lighter to see
Manchild rep a power that is higher than me
Get right whenever I spit any night of the week
It's like freak to the rhythm, hit em right in the teeth
And bleed all the wisdom till it fights a disease
I got peace of assistance for the liers and thieves
Or give Christ the envision that I'm trying to be
When a strong sense of innocence silents the weak
And minds of the apostles still die in the streets
But the spirits gon shine till it's flying and free
Till the top of Mount Zion to the highest degree
I got peace of assistance for the liers and thieves
Or look at Chirst at the vision that I'm trying to be

[Hook 2X w/ Cappadonna ad-libs]

[Cappadonna]
What, yo I take over the land like the four ???
Put the hop in the game like Chi-Ali
Got flies on my face like Somolian kids
Pop off when I'm ready like I'm doing the bid
Straight ghetto in the slums where my peoples is
Turn to Cappadon, never too strong to change, I get it on
Cut em off at the corner, make me go long
Turn the beats up like ?Deja Rashawn?
Never wack when I enter, my game is tight
To the iron chmabers of death and you don't wanna fight
Diggila, keep darts under the fitter
Me and my dula Manchild, we like our style
Came back to the hood, how you like us now?
Got chicks on the regular, driving them wild
Changing the game on ya'll, keep a low profile
Holla back at the kid, we can take it to trial
Got God on our side and ya'll living foul
