[Intro: Cappadonna]
Yeah
This where we at
That's right man
Scrape that pot
(?)
You already know what it is
This one is for the kids
Yo

[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
I'm not trying to be bragging
But I ain't have a lot
I came up from the street
I used to live in the spot
All my homies that I know
We used to hustle and sell blow
And its like I don't even like to talk about it no more
But its my life
And its how I used to live
Now I do what I got to do to feed my kids
Make me want to jump on something, do another sting
But if I slip on that, I'm going to be in the bing
And my queen, she don't understand
I tell her to chill
But that's why Jack didn't want to be with Jill
(?) still bill, all of my dogs too
We just always want to eat better
Move around different places and sleep better
Get paper, floss lovely and spark the bubbly
Its our nature to be the best at what we create
Now lets make a wager
We got the flavor, chicks love us (That's right)
How we put it in, yah come here pudding
Everything is on point
Me and my nigga (?) roll joints
The misfits
My thoughts lose it
I make music and play stupid
Do something, never knew I'd do it
Uh

[Break: Cappadonna]
You can tell
I'm from the fast time
Just to get by, just to pass time
My momma ain't raised no fool
All of my niggas did past crimes
All of my dogs dead
Now you on your family thing
Represent no matter what
Don't throw away the ring

[Hook: Cappadonna]
Stomach hurting, I'm still flirting
Being the world surgeon
For some reason yo I wasn't certain
Never gave up on my sacrifice
Just to see my squad working
I'm still net surfing
(x2)

[Verse 2: (?)]
You could feel like the vapors
Open up your jugular vein like razors
Baby
Dream make up
Skyscraper
Stop niggas in motion
Like a taser
Hi hater
Street code lay low
Connect clientele together like Lego
This muscle, with no muzzle
Super Bowl, last down no huddles
Godfather
Niggas don't believe
Till you bring the heat like lava
My poverty in HD
(?)
And we the definition of wave
Shots of action like Scorscese
Money the theme, Illuminati bar codes
Power in numbers
When you hunting for the green

[Hook: Cappadonna]
Stomach hurting, I'm still flirting
Being the world surgeon
For some reason yo I wasn't certain
Never gave up on my sacrifice
Just to see my squad working
I'm still net surfing
(x2)

[Outro: Cappadonna]
I remember when I used to be a little shorty
I thought I knew it all
I thought i had the answers to everything
You couldn't tell me nothing
I was one of them little smart bad little niggas
Snot nosed
Huh
Yeah I just knew I had all the answers
Huh
You think about that
