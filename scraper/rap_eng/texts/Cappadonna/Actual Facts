[Intro: Cappadonna]
Yeah
Another exclusive (uh huh)
Its that piff for your mind
Study, get your mind right
Little homie (I see you)
Little mama (uh huh)
Straight up the doctor is in
Its that penicillin
Ay yo
Yeah

[Verse: Cappadonna]
My eyes all red
My head filled with blunt smoke
I'm out here struggling
And I still can feel hope
My job not ready
Paychecks not steady
I used to sell drugs
Just me and my man Henny
Now I'm out here flipping these raps
To enlighten the youths
Life is more than selling crack
On the project stoops
I came from nothing
But I always kept my roots
Don't floss on them
Show them how to stack their loot
Intelligent minds we think alike
Utilize my gift
Music make people unite
Spirits uplift, see through the sun's light
The kids loving it
My universal sound
And yo I do it for the public
We discovery shit
All my fans want to cuddle with this
Protect my family from the police sticks
Pancakes, grits in the morning at six
Hot boys running up in the bricks
Welfare mixtape yeah fame (?)
I eat them beats up
Man pass a toothpick

[Hook]
Yo we never going to stop
Getting this paper
As long as we black you can count on that
And if you from the projects
Yo we got your back
Best believe, true indeed
That's an actual fact
Yo we never going to stop
Getting this paper
As long as we black you can count on that
And if you from the projects
Yo we got your back
Best be believing son
Ayo its actual fact
