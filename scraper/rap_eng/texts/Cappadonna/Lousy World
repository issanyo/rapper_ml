[Intro: Cappadonna]
Wu-Tang collaboration, Cappadonna, Intrinzik Productions
New York City, Arizona, it's rock, come on, let's go
Jason Porter, yeah, it's a new era, it's rock

[Cappadonna]
It's a lousy world we living in, execution, people dying
In Somalia, starving babies always crying
Governemnt tapping society is always spying
We want our retributions, plus we want our land back
Stopping these killings, giving our oil and our sand back
Still hearing voices cuz ya'll fail to understand rap
I don't give a crap if you don't understand Cap

[Chorus: Sample]
It's a lousy world, it's

[Jason Porter]
This is my Arizona, India's from out New York
My daddy left me, but these jewels held me down in court
Black and Italian, but we devils for this common cause
That's why we in these streets, wilding and we breaking laws
Both stay, hit he docks, we trading in these shaping shores
This ain't no punk rap, this that get-you-jumped rap
That go against the system, shit that'll get you punked rap
It's such a lousy world, such a lousy world

[Chorus]

[Intrinzik]
We got tsunamis, kamikazes, the modern Saddam Hussein
Buildings being targets, even the smartest can't calm us man
It's a lousy place, and the populus out the states
That we don't give a fuck, we're heading towards a lousy fate
Even God turned his back, told Mother Nature to burn this map
And wipe out whole colonies, I don't understand those policies
Race and religion, red tape and the ribbon
Of states and nations, scales of justice, drop the weights with face in

[Chorus]

[Intrinzik]
This is my California, movie stars and politics
We still got slavery, I thought that we abolished it
The war on drugs, the world split up
The fam in hunger, man in Pakistan, we blow it up
We got no allies, snatch us, allibies, we weren't there
We telling lies to our own people, man, we just don't care
The human race will lose it's space
A thousand fallices surround this lousy galaxy

[Chorus]

[McNastee]
Yo, unemployment, see job placement
Gotta spend money up out the basement
Porter and Intrinzik, Cappadonna
Wu-Tang Clan, we ??? em outa the biscuit
Too fucked up to watch the plot thicken
Too strung out, poverty stricken
Government lies with the chosen verbal
Twenty first century Joseph Gerbals
See George The Minister
Administering more lies with a grin that's sinister
Put the back in when your lies and problems call
Rap your style like crime, we'll solve it all
We got a war to fight just like the Holocaust
Find the White House, tall with a ???
Do escape, we crawling on the floor
Secret Service knocking at my door

[Chorus]

[McNastee]
I don't wanna tell you how to live your life
Your wife a vegtable, just let her die
Everytime I turn on the news at five
The media thinks care about a lie
Helpers think I can make it change
Care about war, but the rest head that way
I don't want the government deciding my fate
Or the public debate how to scandal my remains
We got wars, we got hate
We got Fox News, here's your plate
We take it in, spit it out
Shady green, water it down
I got homeless down my street
They plead and say "Sir, we got nothing to eat"
They ain't the Pope, they the ones in need
Pray every night and again for the meek

[Chorus]

[McNastee]
Hell on Earth, that's welcome here
Smoke and drink up your Belvedere
Lose your mind, get up your hearse
My fame a gift, but this shit hole's a curse
You wonder why kids grab the cay
They learning quicker in the world today
It's gonna get worse these passing decades
Parents won't tell us, just open the next game
Pitch in for what could be realer
Break bread with us serial killers
Here's another new bright idea
Hyde & Jackyl wild is your baby sitter
Don't think before you speak your words
Then let the tabloids misinterpret them
I am ??? and Cap will show them
Hard to see, but we letting them know
