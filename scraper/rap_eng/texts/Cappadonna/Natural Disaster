[Verse 1:] [Capadonna]
Imma twist another nigga’s sandwich
And get managed
Puff after puff
My star goin demand this
Reports, numbers, autographs and cameras
I’m on the scanners
Murdering the crowds with good manners
It’s a lot of rap bandits
Not ready to be candidates
But let’s handle this
Show them how to dismantle this bitch
When I spit
[?] gotta submit
Prophet
Always on top of this shit
Hunger it
7 days and 7 nights
You need to settle it
When I was the coach of that dump
I used to meddle yeah
Pitbulls is everywhere
Yo my kettle is thick
[?] keeping the booker for real tea
You can’t race me
Gotta embrace me
I’m hood
Everytime I hear the beat
Up in everybody hood
Everybody know ol’ g
I hold the microphone
Plus I got the rosary
So when we murder my enemies
Nigga I’m supposed to flee
Back in this fly
Where nobody can see
Feds got to reason with the kid
Till the pyramids
Bout to return
Will come back like jesus did
Street conquerors
Young life, young sponsorers
Bout to run up in the spot
Touch down and get bonkerers

[Verse 2:][Amar Divine]
You’re irrelevant
Getting sick informally
Until i’m normally
Act off and coast
And pose, you see my karma be
Vibrant, uh huh
It makes me live
When I walk up bank
And take all of your bread
Doin nuttin level
And now we got a night cover
Party like the same eyed doe is [?]
Just a second to go
Yo man you dealing with
Businessmen, enterprise, niggas that flow
We got king cash sense
We add cents
For many we the federal laws
My cash spent
Ma sober manner
Stealin in ma farm grammar
Clone shit to grow
Fertilize it with a banner
Watch me up worth double
I put my nut work
Rap into a huddle
Man you little tryin big niggas is big trouble

[Verse 3:][WonderWoman]
I been anointed with the holy oil
Flow the ink, lets me think clearly
Wondering minds
Fastforward not rewind
Plan to do the flashbacks
Futuristic preparations
Now I know how to react
Facing facts, not fantasy
Virtual reality
Meditate, moment of clarity
Proposing hits
Increasing my salary
Overcoming technicalities
Daddy’s little girl, mama’s pearl
So i’m prepared
For the ugly beasts in this world
But now I got my arsenal ready
Keeping my strong arm steady
Goal getting, trendsetting
Captivating
So amazing
Trailblazing
Persevere through the chaos
Now I’m leaving the booth blazing

[Verse 4:][Lounger Low ]
I’m back from the dead
Like Fred Kruger
Original head shooter
Get head on the bed
With the let in Aruba
I took drugs that Michael had
And slept for days
Came back and told Cap
I was rappin with dad
But now I’m like fuck it
I keep my cool
And if you test
Imma eat your food
Ya’ll niggas don’t know my streets
Fuck boy, I’m Staten’s most pop’
You don’t know my peeps
Kept it quiet for a minute
Stayed away from the beat
But I tell you one thing
I had to pay for my heat
So I lounge in the cut with shells
It ain’t hard to tell
I got that ill shit, sour smells
Car kill hooligan who used to wild out
Ow I wanna shoot again
Either or
You or him
A ferry boat (boat)
I buss one online
I’m on 17s
You on them old times
Yeah
Uh huh
