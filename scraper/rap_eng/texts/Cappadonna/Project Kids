[Intro:]
Yeah
Getting this money
Stay like that
Fuck everybody

[Verse 1:] [Cappadonna]
Cracks in my pocket
I’m only 17
Can’t wait till i’m older
So I can do independent things
Well first i’ll have money
Then I got bad diet
Thought out high school
Imma fuck up that
Pray that god don’t judge me
For all of my wrongs
So I forgive all of ya’ll niggas
And I put it in a song, c’mon
If you fucked up the way that I did
Then you more than just a baby
You a project kid
You probably shitted on yourself
And you proud of where you come from
Most niggas in the hood see no good
Why you think people hear shots and they don’t run
Stuck with this loaf of bread
A couple stale slices
Eat with tea cause got it wrapped in ice chips
Look at the black guy
He got 30 white chicks
Yeah we fight hard
And we spark purple night sticks
Urkel type witch
With classy ass chicks
That love me for me
Cause I master that bitch
Stuntin african nigga
Yea
It ain’t nothing for us to get dirty
Always keep a big scrape on our knees since big wheels
Fresh for you
It’s hot in the pjs
I think you smell good, you look good, you feel good
[?] you can make it tryna fake it
Come on man be yourself
I know how you feel
Michael jackson said it starts with the man in the mirror
Michael jackson shit

[Verse 2:] [Amar divine]
Sometime it get cold up in my zone man
Two to the head just staring at the microphone
Like yo
I can just see starting to blow
And get some money real quick
Cause everybody making dough
Maybe i’ll simplify my rhyme a little sum’in
I talk a lot of shit
And never say nuttin
Reduce the realness
I’ll amplify the front
Make it seem like i’m dumb as fuck
And I don’t know nuttin
I’d like that life (i bet you would)
The world train nigga
Glorified kill in the zone
To get some fame nigga
Flav used to live in the house
With the same niggas
Passengers bought in crib
Got them plane tickets
Send his monkey ass on tour
Make sure he say what he’s supposed to say
Nuttin more
God forbid these niggas start making sense
God forbid real players got a ball from bench
You dig
Are you sure
That’s who you are
Are you the person
You wanna be
And do you wake up nights and find
You got an unclear conscience
You got an unclear mind]

[Verse 3:] [Show Stoppa]
I was raised on welfare
With no health care
But now I’m a man
And I don’t need no help yea
Cause now i’m on the block
Building up my welfare
Cause to me now
The picture’s more clear
You don’t understand
What it takes to be a man
Cause now I got the world in my hands
So I plan
To get more money in my hand
So motherfuck you if you don’t understand
Every woman, every man
We all need a plan
So it’s my duty to do all that I can
To formulate and stand
But now you want us dead
So cap said run
So I ran, damn

[Sample]
… But when one of your brothers is down
That’s when you supposed to stand up
You know what i’m sayin
And be strong
And be their clutch
So that….]
Are you sure
That’s who you are
Are you the person
You wanna be
And do you wake up nights and find
You got an unclear conscience
You got an unclear mind]
All them white people
I forgot my shit
Hold up
Blahhhhhblablah
