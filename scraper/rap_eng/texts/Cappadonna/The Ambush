{*GUNSHOT*}
{*WOMAN SCREAMS*}

[Movie sample during intro]
Everyone wants that ambush
Everybody got killed in that ambush
You've got nowhere to come but this way
The only one thing they see is God
You could go in between and feel the fire
Then buckle up!

[Intro: Cappadonna (Solomon Childs)]
The Ambush.. it be The Ambush
What? It be The Ambush
What? The Pillage
(Yo, yo, Killa Bees)

[Remedy (Cappadonna)]
Yo.. Ambush, bag 'im, hands behind the back style, gag 'im
Grab 'im by his head, start to drag 'im
Kick 'im while he's down, fast first in the ground
My thirsty bloodhounds surround your compound
We want all we want when we want it
The rules of this rap game, MC's come to be hunted
We're like oxen, and this be the anti-toxin
Corrective, here to put you back in perspective
Gun check, Remedy, +Protect Ya Neck+
Bring the swords up, hit the deck, disconnect
One glance and it's evident, the war's begun
Brave men wield their swords and their shields in the sun
Some MC's clash, some fall to the ground
Some stand and talk, and get severed apart
Smell of death, burnt flesh
Son, you get what you get when you mess with the Killa Bees nest
Invaders, real life hip-hop crusaders
Clash of the blade, Tomb Raiders, ya saviors
+Judgment Day+ is now, son, there's no more pretend (take money)
God's callin', stand tall, fight to the end

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
In The Ambush these thoughts are caput
In The Ambush y'all cats is Big Foots
In The Ambush you get your face mushed
In The Ambush these thoughts caput

[Solomon Childs (Cappadonna)]
Lyin' in the huddle, my team ready to Ambush
Maria's Child, youngest boy, ain't the one to be pushed
What? Do the knowledge to The Ambush
Flashin' my understandin', your style I stay romancin'
Blood like video games, unlock the base
All up in your face, like Papa Dukes talkin'
You must reveal, you never built nothin'
Shorty frontin' like you said somethin'
Never had a Remedy, blaze like Mark on Belly
The God Cappadonna helped me walk my dogs (Take money)
Tell respect, pay less, respect Catalog
It's fucked up, the nigga stay writin'
Solomon Childs, location Body Brighton

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
In The Ambush you get your face mushed (BLAP!)
In The Ambush these thoughts is Big Foots
Yo! In The Ambush get ya face mushed

[Cappadona]
I move crews like I'm pushin, you just cushion
And real petty, your mind can't hold it
It's too heavy, Rem-D slash Big Donna
Was all ready, tanks came in
My niggas'll keep aimin', assault the fake rappers
It be The Ambush, motorcyclist MC's can't ride with the Hill-billies
Fuck 'em, Pillage, deaf until we get off the stage
Run for the nine-one-one wishin'
Break a reign from the rainbow coalition
Popped off, Ambush, the graveyard shift
Niggas'll take it off, be the ambush
The whole Pillage is Big Foots, be The Ambush

[Outro: Cappadonna (Solomon Childs)]
In The Ambush, take money
In The Ambush, these thoughts are Big Foots
In The Ambush, in The Ambush, you get your face mushed
Take money, in The Ambush (Ambush)
These thoughts have been pushed
In the Ambush, y'all thoughts is caput
(Uh.. uh) You get your face mushed
In The Ambush (Hold money) Take money
(Take money.. money) In The Ambush
Remedy.. (uh) slash C-A-P
In The Ambush, Pillage (We live y'all)
In The Ambush, the whole Pillage is Big Foots
(Killa Bees, Don Don, Rem-D, Solomon Childs)
Be The Ambush, you get your face mushed
Be The Ambush, it be The Ambush
It be The Ambush..

[Movie sample]
But it all started with an ambush and it's gonna end with an ambush
