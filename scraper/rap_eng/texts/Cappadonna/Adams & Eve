[Verse 1:] [Capadonna]
I’m kill this track
Like you violated the family
I rock off of any beat
These rappers not jammin me
Do it like the Indian, guerilla or animal
No matter what you pull out
I’m still going handle you
Plot and planned on me
I’m harder to fade
Mosh ink and mark go
With the sharp flow
I'll T bomb everything
Like last soap and weasel
Avenue crew shit, niggas got diesel
I’m charged up
All of my hoops is in the house
Groupies wanna crush
Play mad junk, get knocked up
They get you locked up
Might be up in the gym
But yo i’m never stuck
I tell the truth and i shame the devil
Yeah
And keep an insane watch
With a crazy bezel
Cause the time is now
And I gotta stay ghetto so when I leave
Everybody know I was sterile
Bomp, bomp
Gotta represent you

[Verse 2:] [WonderWoman]
Intoxicating
The state that I leave you in
I’m like a hallucinogen
That rub I put you in
Every bar, every verse that I hit you with
Depicts a lyrist so extensive and proficient
Yes I’m coming with that street shit
Realistic
O intense my heat text is 101
As vocalists is dawning
Melting tracks like hot wax
Plastic and molten lava
My mental revolver
Turning a glutton into a starver
Better check that 36 chamber
Leaving cynics in the mental clinic
Have your thoughts rearranged
And reversing stereotypes
Yes it’s a dangerous combination
No need for further explanation
Ain’t nobody got time for smiling and faces
Portraying roles that’s going place em
We about to settle these cases
Motherfuckers be on the lookout
For a nigga with black hair

[Verse 3:] [Capadonna]
You can never keep a good man down
And my flows unstoppable
I step on any obstacle
I keep boppin it
I shoot from the top of the stoop
Drivin the booth
Hoppin the coop
Take a break or shoppin’ it too
Coppin a suit
Knockin the booth nigga
We killin everything
Like we coppin a shoot
Rot epinephrine
With eyes that cut 10
Niggas betta run
I’m bout to turn into a nutso
Keep wildin’ out
There will never be enough
I got the new york fitted on
Dutch is green
White t-shirt, act, levi jeans
Popin wardrobe
To all ma niggas that ride doe
Clean as a in [?]
Deemin respect
Hyenas invest
My team is the best
We beat it to death
Yea motherfucker
I be feenin for meth
Cleanin everything like
I’m cleanin the tech
Me and my niggas come thru
Like we genies in rap

[Verse 4:] [Amar Divine]
Feel like a thousand days
A thousand nights
Could write a 30 set collection
Tribulations of life
A mello-drama drama
Mellow cause I stay with marijuana
Semicolon, comma
Pause that consult the lama its deep
Coordinates is seldomly reached
Beyond you mediocre thinking
Intellectual geeks
No describing these streets
Explanation on my custom
Yo liposuction, titty implants and cell abduction
Don’t be cloning it
You want the sperm out ma dick
We do arithmetic
Figure this shit
Dominant, you recessive
Stressing cause my flavors impressive
The rest is only the ingredients to why your oppressive

[Verse 5:] [Solomon Childs]
I’m Blake Griffin in the optimum
Ain’t no saving them
Grizzly winters and summers
Dead bodies in the hummers
Shooting at the undercovers
Why my brother wayne on nightline
Fifty babies round my way dying
Two to the head, one to the spine, jeft at the crime
But I did the time, I ain’t give the feds no answers
Runnin with niggas, that smuggle brick in da bra
As well as their grandmama’s pampers
Will kill your girl’s sister’s boyfriend like a [?]
[?] suin in them red socks
You no rasta cause you got dreadlocks
Orange juice, moscato, moet, rasta boy
Blowin that stick wiz kalifa, duckin the reefer
In the six series, playin in the [?]
Bumpin in that [?] murder inc Gadafi
Capadonna street dreamer Monopoly
The revolver is a bad bitch, Nicky swayze
Shot with snow bunnies
In the pum pum jeans shorts
Daisy, coming out of baisley
Surfing that osca pollo like them donnias
And get them desert eagle red sonias
It’s my time nigga word to gano, gone yo

[Sample]
Get that
With ma lyric impact capadonna
