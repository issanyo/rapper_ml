Thats how I be likin my mic
You gotta know how to adjust that shit

I came to the fork in the road and went straight
Right out the crack vile to the Golden Gate
See the silver spoon in my mouth it had cake
My rap birth date debut song was ice bait
Readit like a novel, Donna Cappa gone
Strivin my duns be dollars and coins
Whether in New York or Compton Californs
I come correct twenty two outfits and a mic check
One derby, Cappachino the great
Sittin at the table where the gambinos ate
Buildin
Wu-Tang Clan concentrate
Bounce on the track Donna crack it like a safe

My slang is editorial explicit material
Breifcase yo, live in stereo flow
Feel me, Donna realty
Set the black people free
Killer bees got the best stee

I drip through the faucet
I never lost it
Where the party at
Give me the mic and I'ma toss it
Head crack talk back, verbal attack
Side track you get japped with my lyric impact
Snap outta that, Cappadonna seven sauna
Thirty three pirranha, chaos like iguana
Projects is rated x I flex and terminate
Sex MC's is wet so I'm the right source to vex
Endo mic buff, Willie on the mic
When both hands are cuffed
Whoever tried to make you fall off
Call your dogs off
Peace to everyday mutts livin with rut

My slang is editorial explicit material
Breifcase yo
Live in stereo flow
Feel me, Donna realty
Set the black people free
Killer bees got the best stee
Killer bees got it lock D, got it lock D

Dart specialist, new Cappadonna get treacherous
I rock track like a neckalace
Poppy wardrobe, singin like you never expected
I'm on a mission, flippin
What Wu-Tang Clan is the sword new addition
Seek a recipe antidote poke G, ebony
Sunz of Man and killer bee can't fold under pressure
Respect The Abbott, Wu Orchestra, what
Fancy talk magic, wise up
Fly girls keep ya eyes up
Track terrorist kiss
Deep in the hill Jack battle with Jill
Talk boss, featurin words that kill

My slang is editorial explicit material
Breifcase yo, live in stereo flow
Feel me, Donna realty
Set the black people free
Work hard WTZ

Donna journalistic
Writin wizard(wizid)
Protect my soul when the devil tried to get it
Seen my goal and stuck with it
Ever since a kid, early in a bid
Doin things you never did
All up in a staircase a scareface was lookin
Wallet got tooken
Free from the work release Donna kept bookin
Brooklyn bound, with the sound
Hop the turnstiles
Fifty cents to kick it oh it's so wicked
Wu-Tang is Wu York, hell up in the pyramid
Tabernackles catch fire within the apple
Tabernackles catch fire within the apple

My slang is editorial explicit material
Breifcase yo, live in stereo flow
Feel me, Donna realty
Set the black people free
Set the black people free
