[Verse 1: (?)]
Ok
Let's go now
We in the summertime
Watching a dice game
Chicks walk by
Fly with nice frames
Small shoe, long hair, and a (?)
She get me out the block
I might give her my real name
Everybody out playing
Plus the water's on
Stones on the corner
Getting their quarters on
Chick still beefing over this one's meatball
And brothers act like a fool
Like they don't know about (?)
Live at the barbecue
Pasta and meat sauce
A little kid full now
From eating like three dogs
Bathroom closed plus liquor store runs
Another box of beer and some hamburger buns
People getting together and doing our 2-step
No matter where you from or what crew you rep
I like these days we can all have fun
Just set aside all the beef and put down your gun
Let's have a barbecue

[Hook: Cappadonna]
That's a good time
That's a cookout
That's a barbecue
People dancing, enjoying themselves
Get your black books out
Its a good time, its a good life
At the barbecue
Honey's eating, laughing
We socializing hope you doing that too
Its a good time, its a good life
At the cookout
At the barbecue
Nobody's charging you
Its a barbecue, its a barbecue

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
The fly yellow Wallys
Beef steak Charlies
Me and my shortys
Piff and my co-ds
We up in this bitch like
Nigga we're O.G.s
More money, more love
Soul in the four keys
Devil back there
Sip wine, eat hoagies
Never kill nothing if we ain't got to go deep
The barbecue's good
We don't fuck with that pork meat
New York creep country (?) and grill beef
Jive bone, tell mom her greens are still sweet
We all love like family out in the street
Run (?)
Sodas in the freezer
Oh look at that, she's a skeezer
Block fever
Positive god degree, African cheeba
Can we meet up on the roof tonight
Coming out the speaker
I'm getting weaker
Music in the woman philosophically
Peaced up, East up
All of my dogs is creased up
Feast up, wrap it up
Wrapping pheasant
While I'm grabbing a tea cup
Nigga the barbecue is tweaked up


[Hook: Cappadonna]
That's a good time
That's a cookout
That's a barbecue
People dancing, enjoying themselves
Get your black books out
Its a good time, its a good life
At the barbecue
Honey's eating, laughing
We socializing hope you doing that too
Its a good time, its a good life
At the cookout
At the barbecue
Nobody's charging you
Its a barbecue, its a barbecue
