Avalanche gets busy the lyrics is right
Avalanche is handsome the mirror is right
I shine on niggas like I mirror the light
Veteran of war cause I'm aware of the fight
You niggas homosexual you wearing them tights
Avalanche jesus peace the diamonds to bright
Thirty eight snub nose what ever you like
Yoeee I saw you riding your bike
Yoee you need more than a knife
Yoee better head to the light
Yoee so I heard you wanna fight
You an industry hoe that means your bitch is a dyke
Battle on king of the dot maybe I might
My metaphors in your raps like Tyson you bite
Lift you off the ground like you flying a kite
G never fucks pussy he's lying on pipe
Never said I'd harm your daughter i'm lying you right
I wanna braaawwwl I'm dying to fight
Your not ready to die for a mic
On you tube you'd die for a like

Bitch you ain't got nothing on the rich every other day my whole dress code switch

Bitch you ain't got nothing on the rich every other day my whole dress code switch

Bitch you ain't got nothing on the rich every other day my whole dress code switch

Bitch you ain't got nothing on the rich every other day my whole dress code switch

Not a problem to put a mill on your block
Coroner van with their hand on the chalk
Ain't talking birds when you handle the cock
I'll take it to your fame I'll put my hands on your pops
This is where the hand ringing will stop
Wear gloves when I put that thing in the Glock
Quarter mill whip that I bring in the shop
The gas money can get this bitch shot
Block huggers twelve guage and them nickle tuckers
New jack cocaine chris tucker
I'll get you burbon or Turkish delight
Green corn like the amish will like

Pandemic bin laden green clovers
Half a ton of trauma in the green rover
Masseratti introduced me to the stew maker
Body blow impact like shoe maker
Levy nine I walk the street with heavy nine
Yoeeeee talks shit but runs every time
I'm like a jew who drops change I pick up every dime
I got a quotable in every line
