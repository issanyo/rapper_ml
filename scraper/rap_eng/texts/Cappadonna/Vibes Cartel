[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
You heard other raps before, but kept waitin'
A lot of niggas is hatin', these hoes is like Satan
I'm still debatin' whether I should build or destroy
What the Earth keep on shakin'
I'mma keep on makin'
Hit after hit be comin' out of the basement
There's no replacement from a slew of great men
I'm about to break in
Damage every snake and Gin, you can't win
I'm the truth, you a fake friend
Realness against falsehood, do it again
Get money, work hard, don't become a victim
Mind your own sick wisdom
Study math, get your friend some
Never quit 'till you get done
God over fiction, this is my addiction
Anytime, homie, I'm about to spit somethin'
Traded crack for rap, and I'm a rich sucka
J3 murderous tracks, all day, facts
Through your mind, body and soul
Let it be told I ain't nothin' to play around with
Baby, I get down quick
Ebony chicks love me for my heavenly kiss
I do it for the bricks, I let it off like a piss

[Verse 2: Wonda Women]
Send in the stunt doubles
I have no time for the petty, little power struggles
No time to tussle
I epitomize the hustle, the struggle of the underground
Cynics and critics, I shut 'em up and shut 'em down
Schemin' and plottin', yet I keep 'em so aroused
When I come around
They say it's business, never personal
Balance the scale, tell me what's the worse of the two?
This industry's unjust and corrupt
Huskey cut for a couple of bucks and a few busted nuts
Yet they keep insistin' in God they trust
It's blasphemous, let the church say "amen"
Keep repentin' your sins
Say a few Hail Mary's, turn around, and do it all again
Livin' a lie, he just tryin' to win, tryin' to win

[Verse 3: Desert Eagle]
Yeah, they call me the black [?] boy, boy
No, it's not a game, not playin' with no toys
Epitome of bangin', his set make no noise
My set sanctuary, you faggots folklore
A urban legend, a Mac is a blowtorch
Runnin' down the line, pack slammers of all sorts
Trappin' from the green, help fortin' the back porch
Let's take him to the building to get these packs off
In war with the system that be lettin' these raps walk
Turn 'em into victims so the witnesses back off
The V82, better tell 'em that crack course
The view of the bully, better go tell 'em ask boss
A five time felon, get your kufi slapped off
Look, got 'em shook, this a doobie rap, dawg
A five time felon, get your kufi slapped off
Look, got 'em shook, this a doobie rap, dawg

[Verse 4: King Magnetic]
Higher than ever before, tryin' these weapons I bought
Iron respectin' for all, I'm straight checkin' your hog
Without collectin' your charts, beatings with seconds apart
We dissectin' the vault while they be testin' the hog
No instrument, so-called [?]
No cold incidents, no more [?]
Po-po pinchin' us, inchin' us over the edge
Ship us over to FEDs, stiffin' over the breads
S.O.S., that shit's beef
Turn [?] and miss me
Turn 6 days into 6 weeks plus into 6 years
All that liquor and triggers turn into cold D's and OG's that sip beer
Timin' a vic here, the climate is cold enough
And I'mma throw it up if she drivin' the pole up
Survivin' from growin' up and livin' off robberies
So if you don't do the math then you learn trickonometry
