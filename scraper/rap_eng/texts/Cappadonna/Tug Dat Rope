[Cappadonna]
I'm on the ground floor hustling, but I'mma still score
I don't care what ya'll say, cuz I'm ready for more
Yo, these streets got my head, like never before
That's why my man Big Gator gotta carry the four
Even though we just looking for beats, they hating on us
Now, muthafucka, so we looking for beef
So we took it to the beast, and got a little deal
Might shut shit down, cuz it got a little real
Now we ready to live, and prepared to die
Yo, all we wanted was a piece of the pie
And a tall glass of milk, the brotherhood is real built
Using the knowledge, that God gave us
Yo, we got to save us, this time we took many falls
But we never gave up, yo I'm happy to be alive
And survive in dust, gave thought to suicide
Yo, it's still not enough, sniff coke
Had a lot of money and went broke, but times go hard
Yo, we tugging the rope, yeah, we tugging the rope
Yeah, we tug that rope, like we tugging the boat
Yeah, we tug that rope, like we tugging the boat
Never forgetting where I come from, I love my folks
We ghetto, like the rest of ya'll, got dreams and hopes
I'm in the valley with you, straight slumming
We got to spit when the swat come in, yeah load up our shit
Watch out, yeah the roads is slit, the flows is thick
It's real out here, yo, the colds is brick
And it's too many fights, up all night
Can't wait for tomorrow to come, we live with the gun
And when the clouds part, there go the sun, we are all one
As the Earth spun, niggas got murdered and hurt
Some, and when the dirt come, it's worth done
Tight skirt holding the young
I'm on the come-up, Q-Dini, beating the slums up
We never gonna quit, til the ones is up
Give me the broc', I like money like the rest of ya'll
Now give me the rock, I'mma shine when it's my time, give me a spot
Yo, whoever can't cope, yo, tug on the rope, yeah, tugging the rope
Yo, whoever can't cope, yo, tug on the rope
Yeah, tug that rope, like we tugging the boat, come on
Yeah, tug that rope, like we tugging the boat, come on
Yeah, tug that rope, like we tugging the boat, come on
Yeah, tug that rope, like we tugging the boat, come on
Yeah, tug that rope, like we tugging the boat, Diggeler..
