[Method Man]
I'm in the weed spot, pounds of purp
All the cereal cartoons is on, my favorite shit is the Smurfs
Now I don't slip when I'm down in the dirt
Cause by this time I done seen life and figured the amount that it's worth
It's the first, cops is looking for work
Got my niggas all cuffed up, sweating like a hooker in church
This old woman on her way to the church
She said the neighborhood's fucked up, and we the ones that's making it worse
Now that's fucked up!
I hit the block hard, Timberlands is scuffed up
No justice in the system, look around, it's just us
They tell me only God can judge us
But they ain't ever met Judge Koffler
I'm looking at this cracker on the bench
Don't understand, I only sold crack to pay the rent
Got possession with intent
Player, I ain't stressing, I'm a pimp
My bitches love the cocktail dressing with the shrimp

[Hook] [Trife Da God]
Cause we do it like how we do it
This is big truck shit
Diesel fluid
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang
Stapleton
Park Hill
We just doing our thing

[Trife Da God]
You fools don't have a clue, do you?
Moving them keys crucial, troopin like Isuzu
Nigga, your weed doo-doo, we burn that Cali kush
My flow be on steroids, that shit that Barry took
Hurting the game like the corns that's on your daddy's foot
My niggas carry big guns, y'all niggas carry books
You shook niggas get stripped, beated and wiped out
ConEd status like Fab, nigga it's "Lights Out"
What your life 'bout? Nigga, my life plush
I lost both of my parents, my nigga life sucks
Us Billy Boys hold toys
Cause they don't like us
Raw like the nose on a fiend sniffing that white stuff
Moving with the semi
Eggplant Pennies
Hopping out the Bentley
Looking like I just won an Emmy
Never been a sloucher, dogg cause I'm an alpha-male
Got that product on sale, look at your voucher
Leave that other gang
I'm Spanky, you Alfalfa
Little Rascals
With no hassle I will out ya
Sincerely doubt ya
And I will house ya
Posted out in front of your crib just like a scapler

[Hook]
Cause we do it like how we do it
This is big truck style shit
Diesel fluid
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang
Stapleton
Park hill
We just doing our thing

[Cappadonna]
Every time pick up the mic
I put work down
Cops don't like me cause I live in a murk town
My high school homies sold crack through songs
You can't get right through the team, like two wrongs
Mad "Criminal Minded" "C.R.E.A.M." muthafuckas
Type of subliminal rhymes: scheme muthafuckas
Can't shake the monkey, life is a bitch
Jake tried to jump me, wifey a snitch
Killa bees wild like C-74
New York bitch, adolescents at war
Fuck the government, yo, they made us this way
You a faggot: listen to what that chick say
Escape route gotta be free like ?
Fuck hoes, nigga I don't care if the world know
Hardcore
Move with or without Clan
Diss me in the cab and they murk your man
I'm a general
Don, with the crazy hype game
You don't like me, wanna feel my knife game
Killah Hill, son
They don't like where I live at
Came from Hollywood so I fight to give back
Real talk
Hard jeans and hard dick
Move in and out of state like drugs and garbage
Nigga feel me
Or feel that blast
ATF, bitch
Just guns and cash

[Hook]
Cause we do it like how we do it
This is big truck style, shit
Diesel fluid
Slay bitches with the Shaolin slang
Stapleton
Park hill
We just doing our thing
