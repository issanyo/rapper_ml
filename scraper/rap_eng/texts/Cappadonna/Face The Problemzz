[Intro]
Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground
Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground

[Verse 1: GZA]
The echo from machine gun rounds simmers
And a fallen soldier, his weapon hangs on his shoulder, lights get dimmer
Key swingin' back and forth in the ignition
The stench was only part of the horrible condition
As he waits for the smoke to clear
All he heard was the blast from in the bombs that kept ringin' in his ear
Along with gun-bearin' troops with fatigues and wearin' boots
From miles away, whether night or day they hear 'em shoot
It's a very unforgivin' and hostile environment
The military hardware, the only requirement
A world with a decease is just a thing of the past
Every advance is more costly than the last
The president's madness is responsible for losses
Political forces, land littered with corpses
Like the youth from the streets that gambled and get scarred
Even the troops in the field bet it all for one cause

[Hook]
Face the problems that everyone's found
We must replace what we took out of the ground

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
We grew up y'all, die-hard dummies, pourin' coke and guns
Violence was near so hallways were plungy
Dirty jean, hoodie on boys, stealin' stereos to get on
I did my first crime when I was born
Young king [?] realize
Life'll put you in a short spot, gun cocked, we was already signed
Day to day slingin', til once, we formed an ill line
Dynamic duos, all we did was threw O's
Police chased us in buildings, different places
This is real then, do me a favor, keep it from children
We was bad guys, stressin' for money
Regulate and start a strong clique, I was that nigga, don't forget
Time to time thinkin' 'bout time, little time left
Time piece is on, new Nikes, switchin' nines
In the buildin', pourin' out rhymes, don't let the cycle happen again
You might get trapped if you rewind

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Staten Africa, move through the rat holes with the hunger
All the Jakes, look Archie Bunker
Scheme on your cracks, plot, and jump yah
I can't wait to get out, released from the barracks
So I can chop more [?], hunt gems
My army got lion's dens
See through your technology, advanced behavior
Renewal of the street mind, I speak mine
Little kids run through your hall, addicted to spray paint
Thugs clash with the unjust, it's untrust in these hallways
But love always, all of my dudes from back in the days
We 'place hard times with better ways
On some grown man shit, gettin' that child support paid
Never call out [?]
Mothafuck what you heard, it's the gods in here
Never slack on that music, it's very sincere

[Hook x2]
