[Intro: Cappadonna, (3rd Diglah)]
Let's mosey. (Yeah, Yo)

[3rd Diglah]
See me son, I'm secular rap, I'm second to none
They call me 3rd Diglah, Respect me dun
It's been a long time coming but I'm here now
Make way I got no time for your funny style
Fake ways, Jake prey on us but we duck down, Stay low
Gats don't sit in the pocket money, Cause they blow
Aaaa-Ohh, Who got a problem with mouth and they go
Keep talking rip you apart, Like you was Legos
I tangle for the cash my flash is something furious
Yea-Yo is the path, I get cash for rapping serious
Stay low with the crabs while my swag keep cabbies curious
I'm smacking on these fags and the game envy is serious
Me and my camp low, Move out like a stamp go
All around the World and I-yi-yi-yi, I spit that gat flow

[Lounge Lo]
Nobody never told you how I be the building
And burning piff with my niggas and a couple of children
Getting gwap, Tryna stack my cheese, Nigga please
This is fairy boat Lo, That be shooting the breeze
You know my O-U-T fit nice on, My boys they whyle out
And blam when they lifting they right arm
All up in the ghetto in night bombs, I right wrongs
I'm House Gang just like an urban icon
Catch me on a bus with my chain and my ice on
I'm looking real yes like I'm getting my fight on
I'm nine-eleven, Who be throwing them pipe bombs
A nigga from the Stat that be making his rights wrong
You know the kid hard, Never do light songs
I roll with the Stones but on the road them white cons
Lingerer zoo part two with a nice blonde
Fuck around say something, You end up your life's gone

[Cappadonna]
New York City, Power-ffinalia
We come through where the feds'll tell ya
We the largest rap group that ever lived
Shaolin for the kids
Round house, Black belts, And beards
Verrazano Bridge talk, Moon walk
Thrity-six clips of hard shit, Hard bricks
New York City and Shaolin, Niggas'll get hit with hard licks
Throw your towel in, Five niggas whyle'n
Nigga we keep on style'n, Cut em up into a half a gallon
More money, More murder, It's the beat swerver
Diglah with the fly handle, I break beats down and I dismantle
Anyone of yall niggas'll get shot, My mic is the Glock
Words'll pop in your head like various speed knots
Come on with it, Come on get it, Long did-ick
Cappadon of the fat outfits, crazy fitted
Straight Park Hill, Bark is ill, Sparkling grill
Niggas with the hood shit, Taste the skill
Shaolin slash Wu-Tang, Darts'll bang
Never forget where you come from, Respect my game

[Outro: Cappadonna]
Yo let's move, We gotta be out, one
