[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
Down in the dungeon I be drinking and smoking
Niggas wanna judge me and fuck with my emotions
I'm too pressed to be stresses never the less
Some got the best of me, I failed a few tests
I'd rather build with you than hate you with this tec
A big OG, peace to my nigga Deck
Peace to whoever showed me love and respect
In the dungeon, yah you better protect your neck
If you know about piff the (?)
The dungeon is not (?)
Mad chicks in the dungeon, never upset
Share 'em with the whole crew right after the (?)
Lot of niggas in the dungeon with unpaid debts
Try not to live life with a bunch of regrets
In the dungeon yah you got to learn the steps
In the dungeon shh quiet as (?)

[Hook: (?)]
We been digging all day
We been digging all night
(In the dungeon)
We been digging all day
We been digging all night
(In the dungeon
We been digging all day
We been digging all night
(In the dungeon)
We been digging all day
We been digging all night
(In the dungeon)

[Verse 2: (?)]
Ball and chain
(?) straight for one's mentality
One man's mentality wasn't getting a salary
He was lost in a world so big
No wife, no kids, no car, no business
Useless
No DJ, clueless
Where'd they do this
Yo that's foolish
To even fake or live life like that
You got to grab it by the nut sack
Yo in fact
You gotta take charge, make change
Switch your lane
Its not the same
Never you mind the drug game
You'll get more from the blood bank
You better think
Or just go hit a bank then
Reality sets in he's starting to think
How much time would he take in the bank
When reality sets in he's starting to think
How much time's he gonna spend in the clank?

[Hook: (?)]
We been digging all day
We been digging all night
(In the dungeon)
We been digging all day
We been digging all night
(In the dungeon
We been digging all day
We been digging all night
(In the dungeon)
We been digging all day
We been digging all night
(In the dungeon)
