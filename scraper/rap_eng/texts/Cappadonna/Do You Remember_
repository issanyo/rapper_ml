[Intro: Cappadonna]
Yo, Ohh man, Yo
Yo you remember when your girl used to like me and you
Ahh man, It's all good though cause like yo
Man, You my best friend my dude
You know what I'm talking about, We been doing this for years
Here you can hold my gazelles yo, Word

[Cappadonna]
Yo, Do you remember when we used to make zip guns, Shooting em
Playing skelly plus balls, We be routing em
Hop Scotch, High-waters, Pops gave us quarters
Rock candy, Miss Terry with the cute daughters
Spin the bottle, Catch kiss and get a little bit
I remember when we used to carry little sticks
Mad ribbons in they hair, We kept little chicks
Block parties, Roller skating up and down the block
Red Alert, Bambaataa, Plus Dr. Rock
Gucci frames, No lenses with the big box
Reebok's in every color with the slout socks
Dyed hair, Lotto sneakers plus polka dots
I remember when we never heard of crack spots
Best friends, Little straws on the bike rims
Tight Lee's, Bell bottoms with the stripe blends
Halloween, Thanksgiving, Plus Christmas
Now brothers acting like they never even heard of this

[Hook 1: Cappadonna]
Do you remember, Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
When we used to play shoot em up, Shoot em up
Bang-Bang, Bang-Bang
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer

[Cappadonna]
Do you remember when we used to eat beans and franks
And Momma Love used to get on us to say our thanks
Or when we used to play tag, Hiding under the couch
Trying to get in rec parties, They was kicking us out
And how about when we used to play hookie from school
And somebody else parents beat us, And mega junk food
Do you remember Kangol hats were stuffed with plastic
And bowl cuts we had were shaped like a basket
We used to be at the center squeezing a chicks butt
And everybody that was corny we called em a duck
Sometimes we beat box and we bang on tables
Graffetti was everywhere, Plus the fat gold cables

[Hook 2: Cappadonna]
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
When we used to play shoot em up, Shoot em up
Bang-Bang, Shoot em up
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer
Do you remember, Do you rememmmbbbeer

[Outro: Cappadonna]
Yeah, Yo, You know what was real funny man
Why all the time we used to have like holes in our knees
On our pants, On our jeans
We always kept holes right there for some strange reason
And remember when we used to have the sneakers
They used to like, Go out in the back
And sometimes the sock be ripped in the back
And sometimes in the front too
And then the sneaker used to wear down...
