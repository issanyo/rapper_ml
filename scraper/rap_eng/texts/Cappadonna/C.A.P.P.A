[Intro:]
Yo I’m an artist
I draw pictures
Same ol’ shit
Different day
I’m not a hater
I’m a participator
Hard times and prophecy
I’m a hip hop entrepreneur
Spiritual rap in guerilla warfare
I’m a legend in the game
Concrete jungle life in the world
I dedicate this one to all them artist

[Verse 1:] [Cappadonna]
Some of ya’ll say you can’t understand me
Cause you don’t know the science of a nigga with a [?]
Came from the slums
Now I got more funds
The more paper
The more I see the hate come
I’m out here tryna get a little break from the snakes and the jakes them
Gotta shake them
Give a lot back
Now I gotta make some
I don’t trust none of ya’ll
You could be a fake one
Friends are enemies
Enemies turned friends
Don’t judge me
Cause we all got the same sins
I’m a hustler
Entrepreneur
You a customer
You want me to do it
Keep coming [?] in that floor
Make a honey jump to it an screw it
Nuttin to fool with it
Go to school with it
Still drive jewels with it
Flowing on cruise with it
And i’m gonna do with it
What I gotta do with it
Till i’m through with it
Brother you can go and spread the news with it
Yeah
Uh

[Chorus:]
C-a-pp-a [x3]
Check it out yea

[Verse 2:] [Amar Divine]
My nigga roughs that speedy game up
Niggas wanna rock with the hot potatoes
Ain’t no thing
Cause a nigga go in
Tell you motherfuckers
Yo you are not the greatest
Tell the dj stop the faders
Bring it back to the top of playlist
Every night you niggas get it right
Every nigga with a mic
Wanna spit some pages
Well nothing is safe
Straight anus
You a homo thug that got famous
Don’t wanna hear your thought
You little wack report
Your lifestyle don’t fuckin entertain us
It’s all fake nigga
Stick to the basics
Drugs, moneys, hoes, no innovation
I’m too real for your radio station
Djs might lose their jobs they try to play this

[Chorus]
C-a-pp-a [x7]
Consider all poor people acceptable

[Sample ominous sound Gunshot]
Hook off (echoes)
