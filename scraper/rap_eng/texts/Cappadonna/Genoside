[Intro:]
Hook off [echoes]
Yeah

[Verse 1:] [Don Shae]
Yo this is for the niggas
That’s killin theyselves
Put hits out on each other
For the fame and the wealth
Got portraits of black devils
Reveal theyself
That’s so genocide shit
I seen it from before
I seen it with my third eye
That rap took a fall
Yo my spirit got involved
Souls were turned demon
Women got infected
And burned by the semen
I seen them posted up
Drunk on [?]
On they forehead
Was a mark that’s no good
Brothers act like taking life
More than making life
The lord had to take away
Their hearing and sight
Like come on man
Hating on don
Cause I shed light
I just war with the mic
I’d like to be more effective
Brothers should respect it
Forcing rap to get rejected

[sirens and gunshot]

[Verse 2:] [Cappadonna]
Hey yo I’m still alive
But you pro’b I dead yea
I’m redline, sports bra on the red ‘vet
I’m in the money race
A honey race
Is what you dummies chase
Choppin chunks of [?]
Up on my brother’s plate
Bookin stacks at a lovely pace
Hustle on the boulevard
Cause I trust in god
When I hustle hard
This rhyme time
Tryna bubble like hot lard
It’s crime time
And we [?] slime
You poptart
You rock hard
Like [?] zero
Layin berettas
Stash boxes with [?] and cheddar
My plan clever
A damn terror
Like al zackowi
Like scarface
Instead i’m blowing pounds in cali
Like baseball
I rush you know if you foul me
Shell cases and numbers down
Try to surround me
Too much luck
Can’t pick it up with the bounty
My head’s above water
But they tryna to drown me
