[Malcolm X sample]
When you study the historic nature of revolutions
You may change your goal and you may change your mind
Look at the American Revolution in 1776
That revolution was for what? For land
Why did they want land? Independence
How was it carried out? Bloodshed
Number one, it was based on land, the basis of independence
And the only way they could get it was bloodshed
You don't have a peaceful revolution
You don't have a turn-the-other-cheek revolution
There's no such thing as a nonviolent revolution

[Cappadonna]
The hard times, tough pain, heavy rains coming down on me (Cap's back again)
Up all night, sleeping in the streets, life ain't treating right (Cap's back again)
A fatherless child, escaped from work release, and plus blew trial (Cap's back again)
Reptiles in the BM-Dub, lizards and fake wizards (Cap's back again)
The dirty staircase, pissy hallways, I'm in the grind, always (Cap's back again)
Twisted ass record deal, spiritual albums, I feel like Malcolm X (Cap's back again)
Cab driver status, wild baby mothers, two sisters and two brothers (Cap's back again)
Two tours with Ghost, the chrome toast, no calls from Rae (Cap's back again)
Fall off, then I get back on, ya'll best to be warned (Cap's back again)
From bum to rich, broke, back to fly again, baby what's what? (Cap's back again)
The ill rapper, try'nna feed my triplets and still flip on this shit (Cap's back again)
From New York to Baltimore, I'm coming hard, no matter what, kid, I still want more (Cap's back again)
Cats is still sleeping on me, but so what, cuz these streets put a beating on me (Cap's back again)
Two Benzes, Cadillac truck, head in the whip, still living it up (Cap's back again)
I'm in the projects for life, pain so deep that it cut like a knife (Cap's back again)
I'm going all the way with this, and to them stupid reptiles
That admit they did this (Cap's back again)
None of ya'll cats can see me, ya'll got it mixed up when you see me on MTV
(Cap's back again)
Forever pushing the pain, never fall back, it's like I'm pushing the train
(Cap's back again)
Fronts in the mouth, ACG's, golden brown army fatigues (Cap's back again)
Momma in the housing, I'm trying to make thousands, what you gonna do now?
(Cap's back again)
Fake cats never show 'em no love, when I see 'em, yo, I'm throwing slugs (Cap's back again)
It's all over for dudes, the time is now, Staten Island side chika-pow! (Cap's back again)

[Outro: Cappadonna]
Ping pong with this...
It's how I be beating your head against the words...
Diggaler, Deini, yo...
Respect the king..., the first...
Uh-huh, Staten Island stand up...
Straight up and down, right here
This is Tyzeen street music
Crack barrels of rap... get 'em... yeah...
