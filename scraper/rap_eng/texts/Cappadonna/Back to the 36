[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
Listen; calm nerve with the best herb
Meditation good for the mastermind expansion
Nothing diluted or tampered
Rhyme raw, you snort it'll make your nose bleed
My words on paper take shape and form
Killarmy's that bomb atomically, you've been warned
Your family will mourn the lose, you rap wannabees
Testing the true MC, why risk it?
You're better off slicing your wrists, don't miss
You shoot you better hit me
Peace to my brother Slick original foundation
Stack brick like a master mason, when I build
Real ill like an NFL skill drill still
Yo 9th, let's snatch about 10 mil and chill

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Me and my nigga 9th Prince hopped off the cactus
Hit out Jerus', all crazy and hostile
Gotta watch out for the pop out boys they might pop you
Stop on any block, twist [?]
Honies everywhere, yo the Gods is Power
Half the floor's on something, slip in the bar
Killa hill Army, yo take a flick of the stars
Champagne in the spotlight panties and bras
Educated rich black kids, with scars
At the Farrakhan march yo the world is ours
The glitter, all in my family, the trucks and cars
Never dumb black people, thoughts travel to Mars
Then we add on to life by constantly elevating
Avoid the bitch niggas that's out there ovulating

[Hook: Brie]
Just something know, this is my life and
[?]

[Verse 3: 9th Prince]
Egyptology try not to acknowledge thee
Verbal biology biochemical poetry
Stroll the streets, black Jesus looking for a Judas
Heirs appointed hazardous to your brain not to pursue this
I open up your imagination like George Lucas
And leave the microphone spinning like a cyclone
Headed for the red zone
You niggas are fake, like titties with silicone
Make way, only a few can stay
Those that stray get sprayed with the AK
Western civilization psychology try to follow me
Demolish me. me and my Killarmy
But I'm in tune with the universe like I study cosmology
Killah with the flow is my policy
Raise your flag is this hip-hop democracy
Here I come hear the sounds and feel the vibration of my drums
African descendant, transcendent
My evolutionary origin begins
Way back when scientists started figuring
The 9th Prince has no beginning or ending
Rappers still pretending, and selling niggas the illusion
Where's the contribution, I rewrite the Constitution
Cappadonna, my persona's filled with honor
The 9th Prince carry on the Wu-Tang Saga
