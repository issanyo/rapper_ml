[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
I'm the great mind bender, I can never surrender
Or sell out or sell my soul for any league of sinner
I'm good when I exit, better when I enter
I go to war in the summer, even the winter
I'm known everywhere, yo I'm not a pretender
You can't defeat me, I don't give about a fuck about Judge [censored]
This is a medium mic, fill it with adrenalin
You scared and tremblin', I kill snakes like a gentleman
I chop they head off and I drop they head off
I pop they head off, yo I never stop lettin' off
Can't stop lettin' my thoughts off
Attack ya'll niggas barjack y'all niggas for bars
Yo the world is ours, young black ghetto stars
Green wheat in the jaws, yo we speedin' the cars
Yeah we beatin' the broads, yeah we beatin' the odds
Fuck around, mic nigga weave the Mars

[Verse 2:  Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo I move like stray forces, bullet proof courses
Immaculate bosses, disciples a pair of horses
Nemesis squeezin' a mac from a black Pegasus
The game follow my rap lines just like a Methodist
Rosee and holy grails, guns are blowin' still
Lines I spread 'em like a viruses through your mind I'm ill
Contagion, biochemical spills
Most real I burn in church, slay the Pope so he won't tell
My projects is jail cells parallel to Hell
Crucifixion iron nails in the bellies of whales
Deceit demons on the faces of all of they bills
The tongue of man kills and nations get divided
Over a [?] while your flesh rottin'
My ambience like Ponce de Leon's
With a high conscience holding lamas under both armpits
Screaming at your [?] shotgun with holy profits
I invade upon, yeah I been a don
Never sell out like Robert Johnson and Viacom
Lines of firearms help out millions of doms
Destroy and conquer
Wash niggas up, Ghengis Khan!

[Verse:  Planet Asia]
Yeah Rasta League rollin', New York money let's get it goin'
Middle of the summer snowin'
Flyin' in a 747 Boein'
When the good gets goin', the theory disown the Roman
Fly Google, why buy [?]
Fried rice and spicy seafood noodles is something that I'm new to
My good niggas is with me, blazin' 50s
Yes sir, the best word to describe it is as "Amazing" simply
This is bow tie gentleman thug shit
For real I'm like a D boy that's watching these drugs flip
Shadow fade warrior, pour me a shot
I'm rockin' out at you because I'm about to copy a yacht
Go to ww.boatsbrand.com
And purchase from the site witcha car
I'm a state cal regardless of this paper or Paypal
The son of man medallion, here's a grenade, BLAW!

[Verse 4: Bronze Nazareth]
Bows crunch, the reload punch
You blow lunch forever walk with a stone hunch
Quasimodo, the rest of them blow chunks
My logic's simple, crack mortar out your project window
Sip plenty with a 360 kicks spindle
Smile at your bitch swindle
The bloody smock grin block block thin like fingers in the cotton gin
My godless spin, goose steel cup could rot and sin
Walk with a sugar cane my plots stay boxed in
Metal name pedal slay tracks within
On train tracks the same blade that slice the keys backs
Graffiti halo horsepower unstable
Rose pedal poisonous tracks from Aesop's fable
Run with a lionheart Capillarian stable
[?] wheat jabs art of warrin with this table

[Verse 5: Canibus]
Firearms and murders this business absurd
It's the federal service doesn't want me to write these verses
Mighty  grapple my favorite pen, fitted choice for a [?]
Lighting up the end trying to warn his friends
Memory's so short can't even remember how to talk
Well enough to warn you not to seek what I sought
Populations reduced down to 15%
They think that's the only way to increase common sense
People provoke out of resent
Riot, rage, revenge, the primal recompense of a man
Disrespected in front of his men
Why would you ever pretend a human life is worth the money you spent
No material could make a man so spiritual intent
I feel that's why Almighty was sent
Backslide, try to repent
But be careful following a life that's so bright you walk into a pit
