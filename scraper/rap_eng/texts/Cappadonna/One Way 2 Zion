[Intro: Culture (Cappadonna)]
Speak wit I'm em, I'ma watch this
Ah ah ah, Cappa, Cappa
Keep ya head to the sky
(Keep ya head to the sky)
Keep ya head up
(Some things might just change, right?
Keep ya head to the sky)
Ya hear?

[Cappadonna]
Keep ya head to the sky, not for a mystery God
But times are hard, take a look around
Poor people treat ya brother as a equal
Snuffin to be found on the ground
These ain't the faces of a clown
We the meak, God bless us whenever I speak
My job is to teach, even if I drink, sex on the beach
My mind is still in reach
Never too far away from the pains of today
And I say, comin in, my brothers gotta pass away
Before we come together and pray, God is the way
One of my sisters ran astray, jail with my people is the long hallway
I see it like the eyes of Kunta Kente, we all gon' pay
Children away from judgement day
I respect Jah Selaseai, some things money can't buy
And I tell you no lie, keep ya head to the sky

[Chorus]
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky
Some things money just can't buy
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head up
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky

[Cappadonna]
Only the flesh die, but the soul is forever
I'm all for God, lovin the father, don't bother
If you can't follow, mind's are hollow
Never a thug, even though I sold drugs to survive
It's all over, now I'm sober, I'm not a Roc-A-Fella or Jay-Hovah
I'm just one soldier similar to P, I shed light
G-O-D to the fullest, these thoughts are like bullets
Hit you out the ordinary but don't worry
I'm like the fort singin on the ferry
The fairy Godfather from Park Hill
Trynna to rip the face off a bill
Now it's God will, like a ex-crack head said
I'm like a fed, stuck in my head be the real information
What out for Satan, waitin for you, hatin for you
You a thug or a blood, get ya mine outta The Flood
It's mine, I'ma flood, tryin to show y'all love
I'm trynna rise above, ain't no time for crime
These the bad days of time, under oath I can't lie
And if I die, rhymes will spend you on right
Be strong, keep ya head to the sky

[Chorus]
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky
Keep ya head to the sky (Whoa, whoa)

[Cappadonna]
Divine, I can see in ya mind
Choppin wit ya mental, praises been due
Thanks praise what I've been to, it's real
Sign by the 'Ville, dude without a deal
With God I'm survivin, it's not about drivin the Benz
I got the ends, but I still need friends, so I can share my love
Forget a club, brother push come to shove
I'mma cry for my mother in the Hill, helped me to build
On times are to ill, only she could make the black man chill
Even not to steal, drivin through Park Hill
Most of the time I was high, wildin for a small piece of the pie
Me and Ghost sat down and ask ourselves why
Did time in jail, when everythin else seemed to fail
Most started the bail, it was hard to get the mail
And separated from my seeds, now I'm tellin the tale
Cuz in the fire I preceeded to burn
Then my father bless me wit another turn
He taught me to be more concerned
Like a grandmother makin me learn
At one sixty, that's how it it is
It's not about show biz
We deal in the orphanage, keep ya head to the sky

[Outro: Cappadonna (Culture)]
It's a privelage, keep ya head to the sky
Keep ya head to the sky (Buck buck buck buck, whoa)
Keep ya head to the sky (Why? Keep ya head to the sky)
Keep ya head up (Whoa) Keep ya head to the sky
(What? Buck buck buck buck buck)
Jah Selaseai (Buck, you will make it)
Keep ya head to the sky (You know you been
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you been partyin
You been eatin pork, keep ya head to the sky
What? Whoa) Blood to see, we out
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) Gods who respect
(Whoa, you, whoa) Check it out
(Buck buck buck buck) You know
No hatred, no hatred, go head
(You made it) Just keep ya head to the sky
Keep ya head to the sky, keep ya head to the sky
(Buck buck, whoa, whoa, whoa
You know you made it, whoa
Whoa, keep ya head up, whoa
Keep ya head up high) Yo
