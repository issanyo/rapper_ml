[Verse 1: Chase N. Cashe]
Message in a bottle to my frenemies
Vow to get closer to you than you get to me
Gotta know your enemies and know yourself
Jealous niggas in the circle, bad for the health
Lyin bitches in your ear, bad for the mind
Putting pussy over profit, bad for the grind
Being broke not a option better play the game
Money isn’t everything but it ain't a thang
That’s why my whole team strong nigga
That’s why my whole team on nigga
A truth hidden is a lot given
Before I spin it Imma go flip it
You don’t fuck with them then I don’t either
Your enemies my enemies we could go even
They fear you they fear me, only way to treat em
You catch a case I catch a case and we both beat em

[Prouducer Ryan "RYU" Alexi speaks]
I been producing for about 5 years now The sounds and samples that I use to create this beat Was a lot of old boom bap type of drums I put like a lot of different layers on stuff so  It gives it that 90’s gritty feel. I really just pretty much just re-arranged it Sped the tempo up, chopped it up a little bit. That’s kinda how it came about

[Verse 2: Azad Right]
Look at my track record, boy you getting lapped now
Wax you on wax don’t let me black out
Push it to the limit never pass out
I’m my country’s Pacquiao
Cuz even when I know I’m gonna lose I never back down
I gotta get it my clock is ticking
You say my times up, you reaching homie no scottie pippin Knew I was the best back when we didn’t have a pot to piss in Listening to Pac and Big my plans was apocalyptic
Taking over the game let me earn it don’t throw me nothing
Rap fiends nose is running, label heads know I’m money Asking is he white is he brown is he mixed?
He’s dope is he broke is he rich?
Shut the fuck up with your questions homie just know I could spit
AZAD Michel Angelo drawing from my life
Channeling a young D-Angelo all up in your wife
Hip hop second generation in a state of elevation
I’ll military press the expectations

[Producer Ryan "RYU" Alexi speaks]
I’m from Charlotte, NC And its had one of the biggest influences on my production Because it’s a little bit of everything here There’s a little bit of northern and southern swag that  kind of meets and just you know pushes the music direction  in all types of different genres
