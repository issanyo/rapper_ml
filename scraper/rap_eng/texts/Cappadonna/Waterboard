[Sample]
The Flying Dutchman
Ay, 'tis the phantom ship that forebodes doom

[Intro: Lex Starwind]
Yeah, motherfuckers, Flying Dutchmen
Lex Starwind, Jon Murdock, Cappadonna, the don of mic
Helium flash, star mode, apparent brightness, motherfucker
Ha, we shine brighter

[Verse 1: Lex Starwind]
You fucking with the hand of God, destruction's right arm
Flying Dutchmen, pressurize, we brew a slight storm
48 volt power inversion, turn this mic on
Get your HD cameras, Canons and Nikons
Televise tellin' lies, tell the truth
Till there's demons telling lies to the youth
Did the wolves in the den got his eyes on the coupe?
Did the troops and the Feds got they eyes over you?
Demonize for the proof
Black magic, acid rain dance, FIFA dream trance
Continental wing to wing feather span, the enhanced
Biometric, through the fire wire, pyrotechnic
The way the God sound through the mic when projected
Well protected method, Vanderslice craft perfected
Sound waves contract, expand, enhance when reflected
The audio acoustic substance viscus elusive
Trained for years for this shit we producin'
Upper echelon pantheons what we standin' on
Compared to Fisher-Price soundtracks and them candy songs
I'm never right, but I can't be wrong
So how the fuck I'm s'posed to eat, feed my family, dog?
I'm straight hungry, concrete Congo iron monkey
Tryin' to see my problems thin when my pockets get chunky
Glock'll click, pockets rip, blocka hit lovely
Jump and flip, hop and skip, got to get money

[Verse 2: Jon Murdock]
Guard your face, force the ox, box unorthodox
I caught a shot, you faggots call the cops or you call your pops
No respect, fuck him too, we chase him down
Rip him out of his Cadillac, then mace the clown
Battle ax him, move like Action Jackson
Back smack him, hack him in his back, make him back spin
Your moms rush to his rescue? We smack her too
All because you rhyme wack just like Maganoo
We hate rappers that get promoted but can't spit
We rob rappers at they show for they bracelet
We run circles around your favorite rap star
And make him think, what the fuck he even rap for
'Cause many people, thinking they bigger than Vinny Diesel
Until they hear him spit once and say, "That kid is lethal"
But they'll never get signed to a major label
They're too hip-hop, commercial rap is what'll pay you
Let me tell you something, none of y'all can fuck with this
So you can scratch that right off your bucket list
You faggot weak sauce MCs could suck a dick
But you look gay, so you probably love this shit
I had a dream about fucking Shakira in front of a mirror
Sipping a beer with ice, no fucks, without a care in the world
Fuckin' it, suckin' it, huggin' it, rubbin' it, lovin' it
We on some other shit, hoverin' out of the mother ship
Drive and find you, Columbine you, silent nine you
If you can't find your God, then Jon'll find you

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
There's a right and a wrong way to love somebody
You gotta dead your enemies, burn them with the shotty
Never let the evil ones take away your spirit
Fire, have it burn them, smash them with the lyrics
Someone blocked your blessings, the righteous don't fear this
Jah keeping ya sane, stay unified
Mind detect mind, black Devils can't hide
Never date a harlot 'cause she never on your side
Can't trust the Pharisees, they based it upon lies
Befriend your friends, form alliance with your enemies
Jins come around, tryin' to suck up all your energies
Flying Dutchmen, we escaping all the penalties
Jon Murdock, Lex Starwind, dark ministries
Father Cappadonna, yeah, we move like centipedes
Never falling victim to the love and them hate degrees
Maintaining our status, Wu-Tang, what? Killa Bees
