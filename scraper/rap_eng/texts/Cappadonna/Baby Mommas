Yeah this one right here go out to all my baby mothers
Baby mommas
I love ya'll
Know what I'm saying
Love the family
We stick together
And that's how its gotta be
I told them other girls ya'll come first
That's how I feel
I'm back

[Hook]
Even though these streets be making me weak
You know I love my baby mommas
Even though its hard for a brother out here
You know I love my baby mommas
Even though sex ain't nothing to me
You know I love my baby mommas
Even though its hard out here for a brother
You know I love my  baby mommas

[Verse 1]
Hey so I came through
Straight Muslim oil and suit piece
Fix my tie on my neck
Then I step to acute piece
I love my baby mothers
Cause that's where my roots be
Keisha, Starcia, Shinade, Drianna
I love all ya'll children like I love my momma
Trying to take care of mine, I don't need no drama
I just love my family like my name Obama
Strive with me, if you family then vibe with me
I work hard for mines, get on sides with me
Feed my seeds, get 'em clothes, cut their hair, wipe their nose
These are things I like to do, that's why I be doing shows
Ya'll got me mixed up, thinking I be screwing hoes
Hopefully I get rich
Long as I'm pursuing goals
There's eight million stories out there baby, mines was never told

[Bridge]
Yeah, for real
This one go out to all the baby mothers out there
Striving

[Hook]
I love my baby mommas
Even though these streets be making me weak
I love my baby mommas
Even though its hard for a brother out there
I love my baby mommas
Even though sex ain't nothing to me
I love my baby mommas

[Verse 2]
To all my baby mothers this one is for you
For all the times I was busy and I didn't come through
This ones for my baby mothers, I love you the most
Ya'll still in my heart and I keep ya'll close
For all the time I didn't have nothing and ya'll kept me afloat
And this one's for my children that ya'll should be raising
While I'm stuck in the grind writing rhymes at the Days Inn
This ones for you my beloved
More love, more support, more time, more patience
I pay child support (?) statement
Still love, still not hating
Family, that's what it is to me
It all comes naturally, attached to me
Send 'em back to me
That's daddy's seed
Get out that room, that's daddy's weed
Daddy on (and daddy look good)

[Outro]
Ha ha ha yeah
Keisha, Starcia, Shinade, Drianna
Its like we all gotta stick together
That's a family right there
I got love for all ya'll
Beautiful women
Family tree ya'll
Stick together
This is the end
Of the conflict
Between baby's daddies and baby's mothers
United
Time for a change
And it starts right now, right here
Baby mommas
