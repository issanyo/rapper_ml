[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
Laid back in the joint, pouring the Cristal
My mind come right with (?)
Women is (?) the DJ hits you
Playing your favorite song got you in the jam
Honeys come around, you jerk your stance
Fly ladies in the place indeed they looking all nice
Sound so good they play the shit twice
Packed joint, nobody can front on this
The heat so loud make you want to run on this
It feel hot, honeys put their tongue on this
Its the fever when the shit make you a believer
I grab something up man yah she a diva
Drinks all night, maybe a little reefer
Turn it up yo what (?)
Staten Africa, Park Hill 103
Where the boys make noise and the honeys yell
They (?) and go R. Kelly
Oh well you better get busy and rep
Where ya hood at nigga
Wherever your little set
Get it in once again its the all time great
(?) motherfucker I hold my weight

[Hook: Cappadonna]
It got dip dip dive, so-socialize
You clean out your ears and you'll open your eyes
Yo this one here is gonna make you rise
Like the sun in your eyes 'cause it is a surprise
(x2)

[Verse 2: (?)]
Squeeze off at his meat head
We rock on till the beat dead
Right in the lobby, where we eat bread
Blunts, Goose, outside sweet things
I lounge low on the whole I eat eggs
Wake up in the morning like yo I got this
Shirt done up like we gon' rock this
I'm so into it now, ya'll gon' watch this
On how I make moves, touchdown no blockers
Yeah, guess I had to do it again
Welfare hell yah, nothing new with the pen
Girlfriend shake ya hips down on the floor
While niggas (?) pound on the door
Staten Island savior made a legend
Teacher, convict, father and reverend
Park Hill recipient
Caught ya'll by surprise
Even though yall knew it was imminent

[Hook: Cappadonna]
It got dip dip dive, so-socialize
You clean out your ears and you'll open your eyes
Yo this one here is gonna make you rise
Like the sun in your eyes 'cause it is a surprise
