[Intro: Cappadonna]
Uh-huh, yeah bitch!
Same struggles, uh, everyday
Hold this, come here girl
Hmm... give me a kiss, muaww! Heh..

[Cappadonna]
I know these two fly chicks, that used to be legit
They said they don't like niggas no more, and plus they hate dick
With all due respect they wanna love and trick
And I don't know if it's a good thing, or maybe they sick
And I just can't understand, whatever happened to the plan
You used to walk like a woman and dress to the T
Now you try'nna be the man that your father used to be
Actin' like you got a cock and you love pussy
You and my baby mother did it, go 'head push me
And believe me, it's true, I know your whole style boo
You eat rats, bitch, you got worms deep inside you..

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
Life of a lesbo (uh, uh, uh)
Life of a lesbo (come here, I don't know you was like that)
Life of a lesbo

[Cappadonna]
Even though you independant, and you makin' the big dough
Hate your own father and you used to be ho
Bitch, it's alright to cry, chick, here have a shoulder
'Member you was 13? Now you much older
Used to be a hot chick, now you much colder
You love other bitches, girl, you don't want a soldier
To all the fly honies that's livin' it well
Used to be a lesbo, but think you want dick now
Ya'll best to stop frontin', cuz you really want both
Me and my ex-wife came down Tiffany throat
I fucked both of those bitches, then I went broke

[Chorus to end]

[Outro (during Chorus): Cappadonna (sample)]
That's what's up... yeah
Yo.. you know me, 1, 2, 3 chicks, it don't matter
I did it all... I love 'em
Life of a lesbo, let's go
Uh-huh, this one right here go out to all
My homegirls up north, Bedford Hills
Albion, knawhatimsayin? Rosinger, haha, hold ya head up
That's my word, yeah, this one go out to Candy Apple
My home girl Sugar Walls, Eye Candy
Cinnamon, Passion Fruit, Melony, Water Melon
Yeah, life of a lesbo... uh... uh..
(We got eyes, but we can't see
We have ears, but we can't hear
We've got a tongue, but we can't speak
We are living men, but we are dead mentally)
