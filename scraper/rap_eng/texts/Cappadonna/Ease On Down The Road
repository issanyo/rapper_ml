[Verse 1: (?)]
Ring around the rosie pocket full of tosie
Its lounging low return of the O.G
High grade smoker, .38 toaster
Building one-six-ooh wanted on the poster
Come (?) get beat down and broke up
I'm in the city where the homeless live
BC, G's beat, throw a stone don't play
Fly high cover you hood
My brother is good
Niggas who want a zigga
I wish you niggas front like (?) ain't got yall picture
Take a flick of the nozzle, I'm full throttle
(?) and get cracked in the head with a bottle
You know my motto
I'm right here standing firm
(?) I blam on him he put a hand on him
Listen to the words I speak
I could care less
If you had a vest or even work in the streets

[Hook: Cappadonna]
We gon' put our feet together
We gon' ease on down the road
Ease on down, ease on down the road
We gon' put our feet together
We gon' ease on down the road
Ease on down, ease on down the road

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
We keep the streets jumping
Beats is pumping
Sport mad ice on
Yo New York (?)
Usher on the radio
Ne-Yo and all them
Suit you up
Your pants got tight at the ankle
Pink New York fitted, we say no thank you
Mister Rogers, radio wave
Jay-Z come through whole face shaved
50 Cent got the industry selling us crack
Yo Nas killed hip-hop, we bringing it back
Hip-hop, catch the (?) Funkmaster Flex
Come on mother fucker
Tell me what you want to do
Stop playing the same shit
Play us too
What up Clue
Peace to Doug E. and Slick Rick
Bang hard
We don't want to hear that other shit
We like M.O.P. music
Mob and Jaheem
While we crushing that pussy
Making that C.R.E.A.M
Grafitti writer (?) rhymes like that
Staten, Africa protect ya neck
Stand back
Get your hustle on
C block control the block
Everybody on the east side hold ya spot
Everybody on the west side make it hot
We don't have to sell our soul to get to the top
C'mon yo
