[Intro]
Wut' up world this is Cappadonna
I'm back in the buildin', I'm chillin'
Big up to my offspring and all of them
Starlita and my little daughter and all of them, Starsia
Ya know what I'm sayin', Caprice
My homie squad, little Garret Jr
Ya know what I'm sayin', original Tayzeen, Angelo Vaughn
My man Supreme, ya know what I'm sayin'
We in here, straight up, yo..

[Verse 1]
Somebody gotta tell me that the world gonna end
Everythin' we doin' now gonna come to an end
God created us likewise, men and women
Three fourths of earth's surface has got shit swimmin' in it
But now to self preventative truth every minute
The mind is infinite, I detect no limit
Can't poison the gods, we see through your gimmicks
Mind detects mind let the little star shine
A-alike reflect light got the cure for swine
Educate, wise up, never fallin' behind
Love hella right, yeah took a fall one time
But I'm back to retract all the right and exact
Add on to light bill power, niggas subtract
Got caught in the serious act, Allah akhbar
I've seen sins and they're foreheads scarred
Tried to take away my happiness, but I studied too hard
I'm like new music right now, good in the yard
Hate the belly in three separate rate in our squad
360 degrees we form and revolve
All the way around the world then them back in them tall?? carts
Bringin' in the high science like good report cards

[Chorus]
A-alike, B-alike, C-alike, reflect light
Young brothers growin' up gotta respect right
You can neva' be a part of this, with you to neglect tight
All you gotta do is read and you could perfect sight

[Repeat 2x]

[Verse 2]
Let your mind absorb the energy as I convince thee
Dig deep down inside yourself and set yourself free
Get set yourself apart from which you used to be
And get used to me, yeah I speak the truth from what I see
Understand clearly, say it loud so the planet hear me
Hip-hop nigga for real, knights and all that
Do-rags tied to tha' back, know you could feel that
Baggy jeans flow that'll rip the cordless
Fit yo' hat shit that make you get on tha' floor quick
Hard knock life, Rock the Bells kinda vibe
Like Vibe magazine, mad colors and rides
Killa bees on the swarm, all my brothers is wise
You know I love hip-hop and it gets me high
So when the zoo lit, all my fans know when I'm fried
And I'm still somethin' where the beat's at, so I could build somethin'
Few thoughts slayin', I'mma start to kill somethin'
No matter how it go down, I keep the feel jumpin'

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

[Outro]
To all my dawgs man, just pumpin' that iron
Word up, keepin' that rice in that pot
Single arrows
