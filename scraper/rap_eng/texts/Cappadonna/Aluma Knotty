[Verse 2:] [Amar Divine]
Run this game nigga
Lock, stock and barrel
Nigga want front
But they sporting our apparel
Speak against us
But only talking bout us
That’s why we moving in
Roads that’s never travelled
Expiration, deeper investigation
Every obstacle
More knowledge in the making
If it’s possible we get in deeper conversation
Philosophical, scientific combination
Before that, snitching corporations
No illuminati
It’s the business aspirations
For the black administration
Who lack the motivation
Looking like america’s ready for the taking
Terrorism, talking longer on the television
Fresh, new ideas
We goin make em listen
Why?
Cause we talking with
Advertising budget [?] in your favorite shows

[Verse 3:] [Show stoppa]
Seen your eye in the fire
Lions and tigers
It’s a jungle out here
Somebody’s always dying
Mothers is crying
Babies is dying
Disease is at an all time high an
And gasoline I at the highest it ever been
But who’s to blame
Whose name can we call
Fucked up
We all seen the buildings fall
But still I keep a clear mind
For the next time
Looking for another airplane to pass by
I keep an eye in the sky
Put my hand on my gun
I’m not a trackstart so you know I don’t run
But when disaster strikes
Casualties will happen
Look at all the bodies they pulled from out of manhattan
Attend to the plot
Ten years and they’d already forgot
9/11 was a dirty plot

[Outro:]
Hook off (echoes)

[After track epilude]
Every thursday night
Your martial arts class
I go down
To the legal beagle
See if jack chapper is there
If we exchange gloves
He gets three points
If he wins
If I win
I [?]
