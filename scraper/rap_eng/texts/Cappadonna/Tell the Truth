[Chorus: Jay Rush]

I swear to tell the truth
I swear to never lie
I swore to keep it hood until the day I die
The praying that I fail
The praying that I fall
But you can pray all you want it ain't no help for ya'll

[Verse 1. Lazy Bone]
I'm praying on my mamma, on my grandma Imma live more
I swear to keep it real -?????????????
(until I'm dead and gone)
Imma represent the struggle
And Imma stay humble so until everybody rumble
But you gotta hustle
Imma keep it hood 'til the day I die
An I'll make sure it's understood that I never lie
I never make a deal with the devil and exchange for my soul
The vanity, the sanity for fang that I know
They get blind by the bright light, sold by the fast cars
Lost in the night life, burned by the bad girl
(Ain't this material world, such an infurious world?)
But everybody wanna live it
And they don't really care what they got to give up to get it
The industry's infested with this evil with this spirit
That's why this song on radio you'll probably never hear it
But I still spit the real

[Chorus: Jay Rush]
I swear to tell the truth
I swear to never lie
I swore to keep it hood until the day I die
The praying that I fail
The praying that I fall
But you can pray all you want it ain't no help for ya'll
I hope I hope I hope I hope
I pray I pray I pray I pray
That heaven's got a ghetto and waiting for me
I hope I hope I hope I hope
I pray I pray I pray I pray
That heaven's got a ghetto and waiting for me

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Yo, Imma keep it real with you
You ain't building with me then I can't chill with you
My mind is on getting that family right
The industry don't care about your family life
I pray to God that we always keep the family tight
Tell the truth never sellin' out for the loop
Never lie but I still wanna get high
So hooded with it that's how we getting' by
Yea, and this deceptional world I'm an exceptional pearl
I'm always gonna be street, I always live what I speak
And I ain't sayin' that I'm perfect
But wickedness can't defeat my spiritual purpose
I'm in a God, yo my soul ain't for purchase
Hoping that I pray that everything was worth it

[Chorus]
