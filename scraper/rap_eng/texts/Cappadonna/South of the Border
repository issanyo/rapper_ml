[Intro: Cappadonna]
RZArector in the shadow
True Master in the shadow
Golden Arms in the shadow
12 O'clock in the shadow

[Verse 1: Cappadona]
Crushed off the bag of dope, I felt pity
My cold thoughts revolve around New York City
Evidence are, in the tunnel where the train enter
Be the gat from the old time, '86 crime
Opposites attract, my electrical shine
OK Polly see me downtown with 2 peacocks with Rollie Fingers
We the Razor Sharp Wu-Tang singers, hum dingers
Try to connect with pros
Drug slingers keep heat under they clothes, everybody in the project knows my rap shot's hot
But suppose you get caught up in the mix
A non fix of convicts, conflict the prejudice, unrealistic
Politics, economics, chicks, counterfeit
2 faced cliques be getting rubbed like Vicks
Right off the dirty water, south of the border
Reporters and Cotton ball heads paid they quarters
To see the spectator perform, cameras are litting
The return of the swarm, the night time storm
Little kids got bit by the rap exorcist
My chainsaw mouth split tracks for the fuck of it
Travel wit the rich, politic
Put your money on my dick
Baby, Wu-Tang is Navy, Park Hill, Staten Island seal
Rock the Reel to Reel, we high hills deep
Creep, sweep beats off they feet
Teach in the cracks of the street
My family ain't complete unless the Abbot in the seat
South of the border

[Break: Cappadonna]
Shaolin in the shadow
Medina in the shadow
The Emerald City in the shadow

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Mysteries revolve around my unorthodox sound
Splash you, I'm still the best in town
Striving for perfection wit my new rap investment
My testament, my own apartment, on a confy pay rent
More time is spent wise
Chambers of the Orient franchise, we fat like thighs
Too much French fries, not enough shake
RZA blow orchestra earthquake
No set date
Me and Bobby Steels got a cabin in Crystal Lake
Industries bug out hit Madison Square house
Roll the red rug out
I'm loyal to the Clan, dedicated to the South
South of the Border
