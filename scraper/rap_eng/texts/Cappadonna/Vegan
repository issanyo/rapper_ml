[Intro: Cappadonna]
Crazy shit
Riding on the side of my horse
Desperado style
[?]more my zigga[?]

[Verse 1:Cappadonna]
Killers for life, ain't no hope
Police in the building, yeah we never shook
Hard genes make a nigga feel like a rugged look
Acid, E pills, Molly and [?] food
The young could have taken a little time to give a push
The homies that's rapping, mine is a weapon
Get it on the streets, you don't have to be at the sessions
Pop your wardrobe, came got a crib near the Mexicans
We’re back in New York, me and Amar be on Lexington
ID's good if the police try to flex again
Can’t stop us
We only in the hood when we pop up
Chop chop up packages, show'em rough
[?] he's black down, black truck
Black niggas, pro-black as the fuck
Africa shit keep white
Nobody move,nobody get bust
Nobody in the building
And nobody getting shot

[Verse 2: Turnpike Ike]
In this shit there has been a slight change of plans
Cause y'all niggas never really stood a chance
And this year watch me do'em for the fans
Do it for the kids I’m like DJ Lance
Rock, sometimes life is topsy-turvy
Me, I'm tryna get it early
As long as fiends snorting [girly?]
I’mma grab the world in a short curlies
My M.O. is to get this dope
So I need blow like the drip of snow
Okay, I need hoes I can touch they toes
I’m grilled like Michael Jackson’s first nose
Yeah, niggas in the hood say I’m on fire
Nigga I’m in the hood like carbon fiber
She can be talking the Aston Martin
I still give her the boot, Doc Martens

[Verse 3: Amar Divine]
We design, find and restore energy
We define our time through our melodies
Nah I ain’t trying to hear the shit these niggas telling me
Listen to this industry
Niggas out with this celery. no flavor
Watch a game like the nosey neighbor watch
Understand how they do surround sound [?]
Just to make your things move about like modern kings
Everybody knows about the sagas that my niggas sing
See the rapid singing, more than all my jaw
All my [?] better leave their business card
You ain't got one man, you ain't about shit
This is a new day, dawg
We figured it out New age program
Money makes no [?]
No physical effort, work for no man
See we enterprising nigga, this is just us
And if you ain't there, well then nigga this is tough luck
