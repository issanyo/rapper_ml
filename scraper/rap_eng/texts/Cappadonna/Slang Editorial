[Intro: Sample + Cappadonna]
Well now
You always seemed so brave before
What happened to you, eh?'
You lousy bastards, you smashed our homes
And you killed 28 of our family'
Eh huh, huh, huh ha, ha, ha
Thats how I be likin' my mic
You gotta know how to adjust that shit

[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
I came to the fork in the road and went straight
Right out the crack vial to the Golden Gate
See the silver spoon in my mouth, it had cake
My rap birth date, debut song was ice bait
Read it like a novel, Donald Cappa Goines
Striving my duns need dollars and coins
Whether in New York or Compton, Californs
I come correct, twenty two outfits and a mic check
One derby, Cappachino the Great
Sitting at the table where the Gambinos ate
Building, Wu-Tang Clan concentrate
Bounce on a track Donna crack it like a safe

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
My slang is editorial explicit material
Briefcase yo, live in stereo flow
Feel me, Donna realty
Set the black people free
Killer bees got the best stee

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
I drip through the faucet, I never lost it
Where the party at? Give me the mic and I'ma toss it
Head crack, talk back, verbal attack
Sidetrack you get japped with my lyric impact
Snap out of that, Cappadonna seven sauna
Thirty three piranha, chaos like Gowanus
Projects is rated X, I flex and terminate
Sex MCs is wet, so I'm the right source to vex
Indo mic buff, wheelie on the mic
When both hands are cuffed
Whoever tried to make you fall off, call your dog off
Peace to everyday mutts living with rut

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
My slang is editorial explicit material
Briefcase yo, live in stereo flow
Feel me, Donna realty
Set the black people free
Killa Beez got the best stee
Killa Beez got it lock D, got it lock D
True Mast on the key

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Dart specialist, new Cappadonna get treacherous
I rock tracks like a necklace
Poppy wardrobe, singing like you never expected
I'm on a mission, flipping
What Wu-Tang Clan is the sword new addition
Seek a recipe antidote poke G, ebony
Sunz of Man and Killa Bee
Can't fold under pressure
Respect The Abbott, Wu Orchestra
What, fancy talk magic, wise up
Fly girls keep ya eyes up
Track terrorist kiss
Deep in the Hill Jack battle with Jill
Talk boss featuring words that kill

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
My slang is editorial explicit material
Briefcase yo, live in stereo flow
Feel me, Donna reality
Set the black people free
Work hard WTC
My slang is editorial explicit material
Briefcase yo, live in stereo flow
Feel me, Donna reality
Killa Beez got the best stee

[Verse 4: Cappadonna]
Donna journalistic, writing wizard
Protect my soul when the Devil tried to get it
Seen my goal and stuck with it
Ever since a kid, early in a bid, doing things you never did
All up in a staircase a scareface was looking
Wallet got tooken, free from the work release Donna kept bookin
Brooklyn bound, with the sound, hop the turnstiles
Fifty cents to kick it oh it's so wicked
Wu-Tang is Wu York, hell up in the pyramid
Tabernacles catch fire within the apple
Tabernacles catch fire within the apple

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
My slang is editorial explicit material
Breifcase yo, live in stereo flow
Feel me, Donna realty
Set the black people free
Set the black people free

[Outro: Kung-Fu movie sample]
- Uh huh, huh. What about that girl?
- Let’s have a bit of fun then eh
- Right
- Hold it
- What, you want a piece of this too?
- We’re professionals. We’ve killed a lot of people as a means of getting money. But this time we’ve killed for a small dowry almost nothing. We killed this young fellow almost for fun. He was hardly a man even. Just a young kid and now then you want to rape a girl?
- We do what we want here killing or raping, right
