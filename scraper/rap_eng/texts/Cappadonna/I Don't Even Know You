[Intro during Chorus: Cappadonna]
Uh, yeah..
Yo

[Chorus 4X: Cappadonna]
I don't even know you!

[Cappadonna]
Peep the scene, remember Cappadon' from Ice Cream
I got my nice clean, my ice beam, my nice jeans
Pillage For Life Team, we fight schemes, we bite Beans
We mic fiends, we the light means
We be ignitin' the scenes, we be enlightin' the teens
Spicin' up my mental cuisines, my blunt steams
My stunts screams, I hunt the princess and I hunt Queens
Get a Dutch and I dump my greens
No seeds in my weed, it's like tangarines
But I'm spaced out, muthafuckas, and I'm dope fiends

[Chorus 4X]

[Cappadonna]
Yo, I'm back on the set, like me and the kid LuLu
Fuckin' with the ill hoes that eat doo-doo
Dressed up Manhattan style, walkin' the poodle
They put period blood inside noodle
On a curious tip, they drop voodoo
That's why when we see a bitch, man, we like "Yo, bitch, who you?"
You know my style, my whole crew keep a nice shoe
Original Don', slut, do you

[Chorus]

[Cappadonna]
Yo, I'm a hot piece, my top piece, they top crease
I knock beef, I drop teeth, I lock heat
I boxbeats, I rock cleats, I stop sheets
I pop a ecst', and I pop treats, my clock beeps
With the pussy, my cock meets, my block creeps
Shockin' ya peeps, my police gut is wop ya niece
We big niggas and we like broccoli's
Never let the Ox' leak, we top cheeks

[Chorus 4X]
