[sample played 4 times]
If you talked about me

[Meyhem]
Ayo funny style niggas they be flappin they gums
I laugh at that bullshit kid, Niggas is bums
They don't really want problems they just talk that shit
Cause when we bump heads in person niggas switch up quick
Like nah kid, I ain't say nothin bout you
Matter fact it's all love, How's the rest of your crew
I laugh it off like whatever and shit, Yaknawmean
Broke niggas talk too much shit, I get CREAM
Why scheme on a nigga like me, Also a greazy
Niggas really wanna see me, It's so easy
Lets cut the bullshit, I ain't hard to find
Guarantee your left hook ain't as hard as mines
So what you niggas wanna do, Kick the beef up a notch
That's your call, But understand you might get shot
I got more cash in guns that you niggas got in money
Understand what I just said son, I keep it funky

[Chorus: J-Love]
(If you talked about me)
Nigga I'll cut you up, Son I'll fuck you up
(If you talked about me)
I'll leave you pistol whipped before my guerrilla niggas flip
(If you talk about me)
Nigga I'll shatter your jaw, Throw you all over the floor
(If you talk about me)
I might take your life

[J-Love]
Yo, Ayo, You flappin your gums, Yo you generalistic bums
Questioning my speech and where I come from
Like what's my race, And can I say nigga
Yo you sizin me up, Here's a cup of urine liquor
Nigga I say what I say and act how I act
Son I'm white and Puerto Rican never try to be black
But fuck all the colors yo my niggas are my brothers
Don't deal with separation that's for faggots and suckas
You bitch ass, You internet geek
I don't acknowledge the meek who can't even walk the streets
So you hide behind pens and your wack publications
Ridin my dick is your occupations
So my son, Bow to the king
My dynasty in China blood line to the Ming
Production, Emceeing, Currency collector
You fake riders, Lick my scrotum sector

[Interlude: Cappadonna]
(If you talk about me) Uhh
(If you talk about me) Fuckin snitches, Shut the fuck up
(If you talk about me) Niggas talk too much, Word up
(If you talk about me) Knowhatimsayin J, Whisperin

[Cappadonna]
Yo, If you talked about me I'ma talk about you
Tell niggas how you bit my style and tried to come through
Steal sling from me kid, Copy my wardrobe
I keep a fat fur and my thoughts is cold
Yeah that's right I drove cabs and me crushin the chicks
All yall niggas kick dirt and be talkin shit
Like niggas forgot that Don taught yall how to spit
Cappadon can't rap, He ain't have no flow
Yall niggas talk to police back bitin for doe
Straight faggots, Fake niggas huddle in a circle
Talkin mad shit, Let them other niggas jerk you
Cap and J-Love got keys in the stash
Yall niggas holla at the feds and be squeezin they ass
Bitch ass niggas, Yall sound soft when you speak
That's for all yall niggas that talked about me

[Outro: Cappadonna]
Bitches, Snitch bitch ass niggas word up
(If you talk about me)
Niggas be talkin all that shit then when you see em
Knowhatimsayin they ain't got nothin to say
(If you talk about me)
They must be whisperin and shit, Like the whispers
Youknowhatimsayin J, Word up man
(If you talk about me)
Niggas be talkin all that trash man
Talkin behind our back, Smile in our face and shit
(If you talk about me)
Wanna shake your hand and shit then all the sudden
Niggas sneak up on you with the police
Niggas be in the front seat just a linger
You know what I'm talkin bout
They got the donut in they mouth over there, They got the
They-they writin down information and shit
Talkin all that shit youknowhatimsayin
All know who you are man, I know who all yall niggas is
Word up cause we all be talkin about me
Nigga I be right there lookin at you
I got you on camcord talkin to your man
Yeah, Your man with the blue suit and the big badge
Uh huh that's you, I see you and your man holdin hands together walkin down
You know yall, Yall in love talkin, Talkin all that love
Youknowhatimsayin, You and your man and shit
You talkin bout what you got, How much he got
And what yall gone do, Nigga yall ain't doin nothin
Yall already did what yall was gonna do, Yall time is up

That's what you can do, Talk about that
Acknowledge the greatness nigga
