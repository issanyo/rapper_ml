The gold carpets
Platinum colored hair
All black on
Holding my Grammy in the air
Yeah; I fought the good fight
Everybody know I was there
Since '98 I barely had another good year
Homies changed, homegirls changed
The wifey changed, the world changed
Sippin on this nasty champagne
I’m on the campaign but they don’t know my damn pain
Still grateful for my blessings thought I can’t complain
I’m still chillin out
Yeah just do the damn thing

The rich dude right here never left but coming back soon

When I was down it was the biggest joke
All I wanted to do was feed my folks
Somebody said yo I'ma sell this dope

[Verse 2: Nakeeba Amaniyea]
Somebody nah put nuh gun to wi head to do robbin

Still they feelings hurt feelings hurt
And if them tink a small ting
When court a rise up like dirt, up like dirt

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Hey yo I’m back from the slums

And I do give a fuck about who’s more exclusive
