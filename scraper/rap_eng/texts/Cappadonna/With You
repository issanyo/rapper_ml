[Intro: Cappadonna (sample)]
Yo, what up, this is for Kreators
Ain't no sweat, same old game, we love the honey ("with you, with you")
We love the honeys, everywhere a chick, chick
There a chick, there a chick, everywhere ("said I'm ready now, oh")
Yo, uh-huh, bigger Don', yo

[Cappadonna]
I love a honey, half Chinese, and half Gayanese
Be quick, drop to her knees
Don't even ask me shit, always on the stroll
I'm lookin' for a straight hood rat chick
Something to go home with
Something I just might wanna be alone with
Something I don't have to play the phone with
All I gotta do is, just bone the shit
First night, that's when I meet that chick
I'm on the strip, C-Don, yeah, girl get a grip
You know my steelo, army fatigue
Timberland boots, don't let me intrigue
But I gotta smoke a blunt with you
Straight up and down, play the front with you
I just wanna stunt with you, cuz you my fly boo
Yeah, you know how we do

[Interlude: sample (Lounge Mode)]
"With you, with you" (baby girl, come walk with me, man)
"With you, with you" (let's go over here, youknowhatimean, to the bodega)
"Said I'm ready now, oh" (let me get a Dutch, and a good wrap
It's so necessary, man, so we can just swing one, you know, yo)

[Lounge Mode]
Yo, what's the deal gorgeous?
I can't hit you on your Sprint cordless?
And one day, talk about it over food orders
I'm Lounge Lo, where you from, how I figured out
It's all good, what's your name? I wanna dig you out
And make you something, get dough and break you something
Spend time, plus dine at the lake or something
Have sex foreplay, and watch a tape or something
Yeah baby, let's get it on, the wave is nothing
Wild style thug, still run with an eight
Got a chick now, gettin' it crunk fifth in the waist
And she dealin with a cat like me exactly
Like, givin' love names and callin' me Blacky
I said, that's my girl, that's my twenty two
Its all love, so the hell what the money do
That's my girl, that's my twenty two
Its all love so the hell, what the money do, stupid

[Interlude: sample (Cappadonna)]
"With you, with you"
"With you, with you"
"Said I'm ready now, oh"
What's your name, do you drink champagne?
Do you smoke a little weed? Do you pop ecstasy?
Do you got seeds? It's all gravy
This the baby daddy, huh, give me a kiss

[Jaysaun]
You better join us, cuz you can't beat us
With professional cheaters, who clutch chrome heaters
Under wife beaters, at Club Cheetah's, so nice to meet us
In them Daisy Duke shorts, no Boss Hog and no Cletus
Love look fierce, three karats in their ears
Gold stud in the bottom lip, and diamonds in her tongue pierce
Shook what her mama gave her, a Playboy bunny
And plus she tail links with a major player
And that's nothing but scandal, and hot wax
Drippin' on your back, incense smoke and mad candels
Body paints, graffiti on your flesh, spray painted on the walls like vandals
She say Jaysaun, so kinky, bright glow on her pinky toe
Green so sticky, the waya I'm handlin' mines
Ought to be a crime, last word bitch
Seek and you'll find, we get it

[Outro: sample]
"With you, with you"
"With you, with you"
"Said I'm ready now, oh"
