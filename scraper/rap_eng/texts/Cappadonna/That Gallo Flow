(Yeah)
Yeah!
This one is dedicated to Wu-Tang, Staten Island,  all of my fans
Straight up and down
Brooklyn where I was born at the Jewish hospital
And 'errebody who said I wasn't gonna make it
This one is for you!
Let's go
Yo
Check it out, Let's get it
When at the night of the party when all through the crib
Another MC was there, no bitch my can share
The toolies was hung by the bushes with care
Just hoping that some static would soon fill the air
The posse would form a face with our dreads
While visions of fly girls danced in they heads
With some cream in the rentals, and others on feet
They shout it and chant it and call it OG
OG, OG, OG, OG
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l lounging, L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l lounging, L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l
Now while was at the age of 18 I was an MC fiend
Need a rehabilitation to release my steam
I've been rhyming so long and now I'm finally home and I ain't saying I'm the best but I've never been told it
Yo I'm a cool poet, not an alcoholic
Rhyme is so correct take a week to install it
You could call my brother say


((Still working on it.))
