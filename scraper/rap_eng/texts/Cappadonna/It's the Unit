[Intro: movie sample]
Had enough you... Tango... when I hit three
Pull that God damn trigger... one... two... *gunshot*
And ya'll are proof, meet me back at the place
(What in the hell) It's Jones, break him off!

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah (Kryme Life)]
Theodore, Theodore, Theodore
(Muthafucka, it's the Unit
This the shit, throw your elbows to it)

[Cappadonna]
All ya'll upcoming M.C.'s, follow the Don
We gon' take a little walk around Eminem's pond
To a nice beautiful place, where 50 got rich
Far far away, from the drug dealer shit
Down deep in the bricks, where the thugs kill shit
I'm gonna keep reppin' my hood, and I ain't gonna stop
Fightin' to get paper, while the pistols pop
These police hate me, and wanna close my shop
Yeah, street flavor niggas, me and my Goon Squad
Mixed with Theodore, kid, bang my tunes hard
Bang bang, be Don, be doin' my thang, thang
Especially when I go hard for God
And a special ed' bitch respect my retard

[Chorus 2X]

[Interlude: movie sample]
Paid us money? (Yeah, comin' in, all right?)

[Wigs]
I'm in the 0-5 Benz, with the suicide doors
Lazy eye lights, and the apple suede floors
Mossberg jacket, Carmine's, number six
My guns out the windows, reload it like The Matrix
I'm tryin' take this back to '86
Where the chains are hollow, and silly rabbits had 'tricks'
We all pose like jail flicks (word)
And them nicks was like twenties
We ain't rock Christ heads, we had Playboy bunnies
And Jordans to, I rocked ones in '85
I'mma rap, but I rhyme, just to stay alive
No jive, we fam, like the Jackson 5
Twisting the Gerder, one leg on the wheel as I ride
No low profile, I need meat on the wheels
And the law gonna help me get a mil for reals
Big business, billion dollar funds for deals
All protein, son, I need steak for meals
Keep your scampi, pa..

[Chorus 3X]
