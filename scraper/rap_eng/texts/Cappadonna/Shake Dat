When we come pass the grass and land in dirty water

[Intro: Cappadonna (Jammie Sommers)

Yeah, uh, yeah, Hah!
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Yo

[Cappadonna]
These thoughts of fire, hot like sex
Never fall off in the projects
Original Don, rockin the world
Catch in the palm, hold on to me
Real rap shit, over here
The Wu clap shit, fuck an MC
It's all about me, raise the flag when I drop my G
Mad love, give it to DC, all for the money, burn a sensee
Chill with the hoes, and get lovely
OTF, cases of bubbily
Shake ya ass, don't trouble me
We keep it real, Homocide Hill
Off the meat rack, coke in the bill
Gun talk, a ruffneck city
Shake ya ass, show no pity
Get the cash, fuck that kitty
After that, it's time to get dough
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Gimme a track, I lace the flow
I go to places y'all can't go
Overseas, me doin the show
Playa hate me but we got the Mo'
Test me, that's a big no-no
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Uh!

[Chorus 2X: Jammie Sommers]
Fuck y'all niggas if y'all don't know
If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go
Wu-Tang, forever gettin dough
All In Together, like at the show

[Cappadonna]
Love is still love, come on girl
Give me a chance, I'll rock the world
Shake ya ass, get on down (If y'all ain't wit us)
We stay trippin, my part of town
Sex on the beach, came with the piece
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
It's all good, you just like the beast
Take ya time, ain't nothin wrong with the bump and grind
Blunt in ya hand, dust on ya mind (If y'all ain't wit us)
Enjoy ya cash, we all wanna shine
Nine to five, not the part time
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Shake ya ass, baby don't quit
Tight dress, yea you the shit
Nice hair-do, heavy on the wrist
Buck-head bounce just the twist
Everybody do it, just like this
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
VA style, somethin you can't miss
Wu-Tang, poppin the Cris'
Down in B-More, ya name on the list
Free for all, it ain't no pay
Love for love, let's break day
Everybody chill, it's time to play
Shake that ass, shake it away
Shake ya ass, I'll show you the way
Uh!

[Chorus 3X]

[Cappadonna]
Peace in the club, havin the fun
Fuck all the hoes, not just one (Y'all got to go)
Here with the dogs, we all want some
Later for that, keep chasin the cat (Y'all got to go)
Shake ya ass, bump in the back
Live as a fam, don't smoke crack
Summertime, don't know how to act (Y'all got to go)
G-string, all up in ya rump (Never that!)
Football style, brothers'll pump
Pop that coochie, get in the front
Ride that shit, do a little stunt
Fuck these cats, is scared of the cunt
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Shave her ass, do it for a month
FUBU city, nigga don't front
Sweat to ya death, spark that blunt
Whatever you do, never make war
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Wu-Tang niggas'll break that jaw
Stay on the dancefloor, keep it real
Shake it, break it, love the feel
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Sounds so good, it's sex appeal
Cappachino put sex on the reel
Shake it baby, you know the deal Uh!
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)

[Outro: Cappadonna (Jammie Sommers)]
Yeah, uh! Yeah! You know the deal girl
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Uh! Give it to a nigga, uh!
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Do it, uh! Come on girl
You to nigga, uh!
(Wu-Tang, if y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Uh-huh, yeah!
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Chk-chk..
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go)
Uh.. {*laughs*}

[Skit Outro: Cappadonna]
This is only my sophmore project, man
But I still feel like a freshman
You know, so I got anger
I'm comin in, I'm comin in like one of the new jacks
Just comin in Elmira, wit the D-suit on and whatever
All wrinkled up, niggas throwin piss down
From the eight galleries or whatever
You know, but that's me right there
So what, I'm just comin to represent
