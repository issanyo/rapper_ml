[Intro:]
Yeah
All the time
Prepare yourself
Straight up
[?] about to get real
Let’s do this
We do it hood style
Killer hill all the way to the bottom
To the top
Imma get mine you (echoes)
We gonna get this bread
Trust me when I tell you
Let me hold that thing
[gunshot]
Hook off (echoes)

[Verse 1:] [Cappadonna]
They tryna replace love in the world with falsehood
Robots and virtual reality
Bring slavery back
Cut everybody's salary
Lock yourself up for a mere technicality
Homies say they buggin
But they not conscious
I’ve been around the world
I’ve dealt with a lot of monsters
Wu tang squad s bonkers
I’ve been in the rap game for the longest
Black defenders
Go to war with the space invaders
Androids everywhere
Smash them like potatoes
Move like pacman
An original styler
Honey see my donkey kong
Is all gallagher
Tom told cherry to chil
So I could wild with her
Three’s company now
Call it my a team
All in the family yeah
We can make clean
Step it up like the jeffersons
Have good times
Hook north in these beats
Ain’t nuttin like hood times
Hate is enough
Be the partridge family
We the black brady bunch
Give it out like it’s free lunch
Yeah
Four hustler flow
Got that
All day with it
Don’t play with it

[Verse 2:] [Chunky]
It’s a different world
Got a lot of different strokes
But that’s the facts of life
Dont take it as a joke
I’m not batman
I’m the original black man
Tellin the kids what to do
When they see that crack man
Evidence of fingerprints
Booby trackers in my ends
Do god’s plans
Raise the level of the nubians
Yeah we the super fans
Mega bigga hip hop stars
The stupid [?]
Tougher than leather
We all in together
We never goin sever
We bringin the tether
Breaking the sound barrier
Worldwind
Shaolin fists
Black activist
Young,black, ghetto rich
I’m down for the brick
I don’t give a fuck yo
And I don’t really give a shit
Imma keep wilding out
Until I make it to the tip
Up there
Somewhere real high
Airplane to
So plain
On the go
Real, real fast
Make money on the train yo
(making the change tho)

[scratching dubs - cap-cap-cap-cappa…
The great-the-the-the great]

[Verse 3:] [Kash Verranzono]
I said the town’s built now
I’m just waiting to give it to em
I search in his crib
Bring it straight to his living room
Grown man blitz
I’m coming off of the d line
Tell him fall back
Take a seat and then recline
Killer hill bully is back
I got the whole crew
30 shot filled to the top
Give em the whole thing
I stand clear of niggas that on that sufferin shit
I will dearly depart
Anybody you fuckin with
A savage
That charlie i’m dumping
Automatic
I’ll get your head
Put in that paper bag
On plastic
Gangsta’s turning gullible
Same hood niggas that look up to you
And honestly say don’t even fuck with you
The more you going put in
Is the more you going get out
You rocking down new york
Then afterwards spread out
You think you going get rid of me
Really got to be kidding me
You’d only made me stronger
You fuckers thought it was killin me
Guess what
Zipper your war boots and your vests up
Cause when i’m done loading with niggas
You next up
You smashing on the pedal nigga
It’s my year
So realise I ain't goin nowhere
Homicide

[Scratching dubs - cap-cap-cap-cappa…
The great-the-the-the great]

[Verse 4:]
Yeah
Uh huh
Straight from the motherland
Dick bitches know how to smoke them greens
They creep through your window like [?]
This what you get
Plastic 40
Invisible cut
And the camera guy was me
Poppin spades in the vic
And they off you
You stay talking shit
But it cost you
You left your fame straight
But that’s all you
Bitch nigga
I’m next door
I’m on top yo spouse
Move wrong motherfucker
Put the blade in her mouth
Knock her head to the roof
Just to clear the shit out
Nigga shot just to get a [?] round on the house
Talk slick
And i’m taking you out your misery
Revolver spinnin in both hands
Like yosemite
I’m from the block
I bet these niggas remember me
Tryna go the harder way
Just like timothy
Pause on dope
Nigga be on the smack card
Od on beats
Motherfucker i’m natural
Plastic Glock
Bullets is titanium
Kinda shit that melt in your hand
Before you bang on em
I know you don’t like your view
But keep hating then
I hope [?] will put a move
Off in his cranium
Bow bow bow bang bow bow
Bop bop
Blooooww
Bbbblllooooow
Yo cat
What the fuck is that
Homicide housing
Loose lips

[Outro:]
Hook off (echoes)
Bang (echoes)
