[Intro: Cappadonna (Born Divine)]
Uh, yeah, Park Hill Productions
The belt, aiyo Peace God (Peace God)

[Cappadonna]
Yo, I just came back from uptown, got a dozen of coats
Two ki's of Nikes and a platinum rope
Chrome with the microscope

[Born Divine]
What you wanna do?
I got a truckload of shit, everything is brand new
I got a rock that I caught from Tiffany's, fifty g's
And ten hot Bentley's from overseas
The color of leaf

[Cappadonna]
Yo, Born, watch out for the thieves
Keep your third eye open, watch out for the thieves
Keep that gun by the knife, then we out in the breeze

[Born Divine]
Out in the breeze, larger than life
We got stacks over there, we'd rather snatch tonight
Make sure that paper right, while we breaking the ice

[Cappadonna]
Breaking the ice, laying track, chasing the mice
Loading the trunk, you got five jet planes, we'll explode in the front
We don't hang around rats, waste money on stunts
We like Marriott Hotels, laying in cartel
Cream like Carvel, yo, my team got bars and shells

[Outro: Cappadonna]
Bra-a-at.. that was it?
Uh-huh, this one is like a fresh pair of shoes
With some new tags...
