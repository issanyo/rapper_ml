[Intro]
Yo yo right here
This one is for the banana gang
Yeah
Word up
Bust them banana clip thangs
Shh
Know what I’m saying
Gladiator posse (Get ‘em)
C’mon let’s go

[Verse 1]
I got a fetish for hot chicks
Hot cars, trucks, fly whips
Seventeen I got whipped
Crack, drugs, guns, all kinds of shit
I used to be in the bricks
Like a stray dog, petty crimes
Young homies with no minds carry nines
The pain made me stronger
The blocks getting longer
Police (?) type shit over (?)
New York overboard nigga
See Digga
Postcard, can’t afford the sticker
What the fuck nigga
This shit is ridiculous
Get with this
Mosey with the go-getters
Hats, Nikes, and sweaters
The back of the pound pound
Straight crazy head trips
I’m a fuck up, child support victim
Off my rocker, I don’t know just pop you
Black out like my lost dog
Religious rap doctor, beef stopper, peace popper
Give me love, give me crazy hugs
Yeah I’m better when I’m down with serious thugs
Certain niggas can’t be at the clubs
They be in the valley in the shadow of death
Hope niggas never lose they step
Arm or head either
This one is like ether
I’m not yalls teacher
Yall like Halloween, Bush, and Easter
I just sit up in the booth and I bust the beats up
(Get ‘em)

[Outro]
Uh huh
Now’s the time
Now-now-now’s the time
For us to come amongst this nation
This nation of rap artists
And give homage to the palmers
The Heckle and the Jeckyll
Big Don
(?)
Nigga
(?) part two
This catfish ain't allowed around here
Fucking boys
Yeah
