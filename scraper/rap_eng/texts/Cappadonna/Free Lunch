[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
First off get them in the bed
Take they shirts off
(?) the weed and thizz
Honeys love me like this
Ice wrists and deep dish
Five 25th yo my swag is the compass
Black a proud, a nigga whatever I accomplish
Mama Hills son, I carry a real gun
But when I steal something catch all of my shells
Hardbody is the case, my brain's in the cell
My heart's like a prison
Yeah my thoughts is hell
I'm out here, I see the shit when I spark my L
I'm free now
I feel like I escaped from jail
I move like a wiseman making my bail
Governments plant fear in their mail
I don't fail
My thoughts stay fresh on my niggas that don't squeal
Papi (?), freedom mean more than a bitch
I'm going to grind hard all day and get these chips

[Verse 2: (?)]
I move with them niggas who shake dog
A couple of eight balls
And know when to shake them jakes off
Its late night so I gotta get cake dog
And tell a bitch I'll beat her girlfriend (?)
Ain't nothing to (?)
We could face off
And after that dude, I'm back getting that base off
If the drought come I cake off
And get money
Double up, sit in the truck
Lay low where its nice and sunny
Hold the blam down
I started thinking of self
Like this is my man's town
I'm on the regular
B-boy city mix
You niggas live
But this is how B-Easy get
I slide through with a crew that's Su-Wu
Hundred niggas on bikes out the one-six-ooh
