[Intro:]
Nothing like a home cooked meal
Yes my word is my bond
Feels so good to be back in the hood
It’s a place that I can never forget

[Verse 1:] [Capadonna]
Everything dip in my heart
My brains is numb
Computers taking over
They controlling the young
Out here grinding
Hard like it never even profit
Still they’re not stoppin me
I’m doing the monopoly
Yeah I move privately
Stacking for my Cs
Never sloppily, yeah
I hope they’re not watching me
Familiar faces
Fandom or fortune
Travelling more often
Hating ass, grab ass niggas
Want me to fall off the wall
Take one, put me in a coffin
Six million dollar man, steven austin
Yeah nigaa tell your story walkin
Before I put two in your foreskin
Backin atown now i’m in low in the [?]
Switched my gear round
Now i’m back in new york again
State recording, only stay for a short rate
Speeding through the [?] mistakes yeah
I’m going in so I can stop all of the aches
Stress and related injuries
It’s hard for me to fuck with you
Fast track seeing young rappers
Using bars moves to attacks
Babes that drunk similac
A lotta shit
I can’t remember that
All young with the gold fronts
Selling it for munchies
Yes niggas is thirsty
Yeah is [?] wid da blunt
Yeah it’s power in the punch
Yeah it’s sour in the cunt
Sex made housing free lunch
No deal though
Used to always spittin hood before
I caught a dope deal
I rinse [?] to arena
Toes to [?]
Seen the motown lp saturday morning clean up
Mama in the kitchen
Papa watched sports ya’ll
Respect the elderly
Respect everything they taught ya’ll
Whip his ass for that report card
Daddy’s up [?] to have their son’s sports cars
Forget what [?] promise to God

[Verse 2:] [Turnpike Ike]
Niggas is mad I give em buts and excuses
This exclusive
Old school, cool new kid
Uhh, it’s like we verbally abusive
But don’t blame me blame the producing
I guess it’s a blast from the past
Take a pocket full of cash
Make you [?] from the path
And ain’t a damn thing changed
Niggas still chasing dames with Dwayne Wayne frames
We used to play Connect 4
Now fast forward, we be connects for
My flows still up to date
My niggas still moving weight
Put more power in your plate
Than carnival funnelcakes
And I keep it on the up and up
The hood cowboy
All i do is buck and fuck
My life ain’t picture perfect
Just a nigga tryna make it out the [?]

[Verse 3:] [Desert Eagle]
I’m down for the get down
Pound for the pitdown

Gaming, I’m selling by the pit now
I got a chain gang and we all get down
Frontin’ the cash
You know we’ll spit rounds
My dudes will touch you with
Clear hold strip rounds[?]
I’m a lone ranger
Of the Stone rangers
That’s why shit stretch about 4 acres
Used to doubt me
Until you all caught the vapors
Then you on my dick
Everybody wants Raymond
One taking em’
Honin them and clonin the greatest
You outdated
I’m upgraded
I am the Matrix
Saved to mainframes and databases
Tryna hit me with a virus called playerhating
I got that hardware
Every shine devastated
Brooklyn, lime green, every [?] levitated
