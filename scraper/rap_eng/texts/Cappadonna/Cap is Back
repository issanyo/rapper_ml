[Intro: Lounge Mode (Cappadonna)]
Yo yo yo yo yo (Guess who's back?)

[Hook: Lounge Mode]
Aiyo I thought I told y'all before that Cap is Back
And the bitches in the club said Cap is Back
I got them thugs over there that said Cap is Back
And them Bloods over there who said Cap is Back

[Cappadonna]
I don't have to tell y'all niggas how it is in Da Struggle
Police chasin' me down, niggas start to bubble
Cracks and Blood niggas in the huddle
It's rainin' cats and dogs, and kids in the puddles
We still in the game like Poppy, Chad and P-Double
Hard-headed niggas causin' the trouble
Stank-ho niggas wanna see niggas behind the bubble
So they could start fuckin' ya man
Space Invadin' ass niggas takin' up land
Tryin' to understand my ill pain
No matter what you do I'mma still gain in Da Struggle
(Fuck you, double, niggas shoot dope in the game
This shit is serious)

[Hook]

[Cappadonna]
Aiyo it's not a game
You play chess with life, end up in the flame
Y'all snakes is five dollars and I'm about to make change
Out of devious chicks and niggas that lack brains
I'm on a whole 'nother level, kid feel me
Yeah, nigga, it's the real me
The project roaches, hoodrats, the broke TV
You can't see me
And let it be known that, any pretty ass chicks, nigga? I want that
Voodoo ass bitches get thrown back
You can't dethrown Cap
Stay focused on the regular
Be in the Hoopty with a shorty on the cellular
Lovin' my project like Nelson Mandella
Or the church love Christ, just pass the paper
Everything be alright, from Da Struggle
(Uh-huh, you two faced motherfuckers)

[Hook]

[Interlude: Cappadonna]
Y'all don't like me and I don't like none of y'all niggas

[Cappadonna]
You don't have to ask twice, I'm still in the Hill
Been all around the world, it's hard to pay bills
What you think? That Da Stuggle ain't real?
Rappers don't murder shit, niggas won't get killed?
You just a baby on an E. pill
And I'm ill with the skill
Shake the po-po off me
Runnin' fuckin' the ho's, fuck how y'all niggas feel
I'm too official
Any time, nigga, I could come get you
You shook while you got sickle
Brothers amongst brothers
Stay to make babies but they not wit you
Bleed with you, they snitch for the police too
Reptiles in the Benzo
The come adept, what they still do to ya clit
Struggle with this

[Interlude: Cappadonna (Lounge Mode)
Come on (y'all comin' real fast, push the love
I'm killin' you) To all y'all niggas out there
Yeah (go with y'all man, go with y'all)

[Hook]

[Outro: Cappadonna (Lounge Mode)]
Right in ya balloon you two-faced bitch
(Right in ya balloon, we got Skeero with us)
Yeah, I used to love y'all niggas
(Skeero is wit us man
Yo how ever y'all wan' do it man)
Now when I see you (when I see you
I see you, you could be me man
Ain't nothin' man) Niggas speak in codes
(It's right here)
