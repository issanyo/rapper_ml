[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
Yeah
Sure as I live I'm going to get mine
Straight up and down Pillage forever
Ayo, ayo
We sat up in the booth last night
On some ill shit
Put our minds together
Start spitting the real shit
Market these darts get a deal real quick
Yo me and my brother lounging we hustle for chips
We on the road often
Living, we forced to win
Blowing on your mindstate yo of course (?)
While Lil Wayne got your brain
Yo we doing the same
We make music hood yo
Collect our change
We drop the flavor
All over the world like rain
Reincorporate our life and mix it with street pain
We been through this shit
We not new to the game
Ladies love how we drop the hits
We make movie premiers
Get money and we pop the flicks
Its all love baby girl
Not money and drugs
Its no turning back
Yo its the life we live
We hustle everyday
Grind hard, raise the kids
And we don't waste time out here
We know what it is
Live your life
Live your life
Its your biz

[Verse 2 (?)]
Yo know the airplane flights
Gym shows in London
I hit the booth
Spit darts to attract this pumping
Spread love to the fans
Get the whole crowd jumping
And me I move well like Barack on something
Lay back on that tour bus
I caught a thought of getting money, burning piff
And yeah busting more nuts
Jokes, I laugh
Some niggas mind they own
Some talk shit, but get choked and stabbed
Listen
I'm the one who be choking the pad
From Staten Island, Park Hill who be scoping your flag
Mama love said do it baby, you go boy
Peace to Sham
You know that nigga he so 'roid
I need money like Jay-Z
A house like Lil Wayne
A Kanye beat, no T-Pain
Change my voice, picture me doing that
Yall know the kid and the shit that I do with Cap
Yo its no turning back, its the life we live
We hustle everyday, grind hard, raise the kids
And we don't waste time out here, we know what it is
Live your life
Live your life
Its your biz

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
We like pretty women
Big jewelry and fly wardrobes
Crazy kicks, we like to be at the shows
Getting our fresh on
Breaking ballers, never faking moves
We on some late night shit, honeys is right
Dim lights, the crowds gather, the crews post up
Mad swagger, everybody comfortable
Its crazy how I bump into you
Dimes is cute (?)
Rhyme and puff roots
Get off your stoops, support truth
(?) for roots for rap
Never let the mind go back
Take our time and recline back
Live life, cherish life, cherish the mic, inherit the sight
Mi casa es su casa
Man straight up and down, do what you gots to
Give a little, take a little
Bring it in the middle and get diddled
Its no turning back
Yo this the life we live
We hustle everyday, grind hard, raise the kids
And we don't waste time out here
We know what it is
Live your life
Live your life
Its your biz
