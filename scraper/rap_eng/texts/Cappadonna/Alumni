[Verse 1:] [Cappadonna]
I jump off the building
I land in first class
I was only 13
When she gave me my first ass
I remember KC gave Sherman a dirt back
From the wild streets
Where nobody say we worth trash
Put God first, then vocabulary, church maths
Quiet, go higher
Then you start to admire
Swing Reverend in the house
You steppin in my fire
Bells ring
Angels appear
I throw spears
Beyond the clouds
Yea I sing it for every child
When go go foul
I feed mine from exile
So special
Peep ma next style
Guaranteed to get the flex out
Never stressed out
Came back and now he’s stressed out
Up in the hills with black
My dawg remo
Watched my team glow
Let the steam blow
Still on my theme tho
So all ya’ll brothers
Better line up and pay attention
Haters and enemies better line up for detention
Me and my henchmen
Moving like french men
Burn the dutch master
Burn good incense
The harder we go
The shit get intense
Niggas fuck around
It’s goin be a bad incident
Sue woo
36 chambers in an instant
Never get fenced it
Coco [echoes]

[Verse 2:] [Amar Divine]
You make em’ listen
Came to give em what they missin
Turn this whole game
Into a verbal composition
Life, position be like that of a right
He ain’t holding a pen
Like what the fuck should I write
See everybody here be on the sterotype
I ain’t the one to follow suit
Ain’t wearing your tights
Will know with my intelligence
Search for higher heights
Seeking better understanding
Words like advice
From christ or buddha
A vicious barracuda
Rhymes like pen on [?]
So they consume us
You heard i’m nice
Well i’m better than the rumors
Can hardly even fathom
How we making these moves
You blessed or sumtin
Are you next door frontin
You may made this shit
But you can’t take nothin away
We either get broke or get paid
Better make your choice
Or get the fuck up out the way nigga

[Verse 3:] [Don Shae]
Shae the Ape
Gorilla like King Kong
Yea..move them things back and forth
Like ping pong
Michael Corleone
Pinky ring on what?
I kill a beat
Getting the sting on
Now pulverise anything that i’m on
I keep swing on
These corners you clingin on to
You wanna ride or collide
Bring it on
Guns been supplied
The silencer spinned it on
Let’s get it on
For sure get your fitted on
Mac 11, squeeze til his middle’s gone
I don’t nuts or force cups
With bad chicks
Who grown up but fold up
When the man kick
Mad gits wanna clash with the beast
It’s like jurassic park
Not a rap to the [?]
Enemies wanna pass in the street
The only way you pass
Is when I pass the heat

[Outro:]
Hook Off (echoes)
