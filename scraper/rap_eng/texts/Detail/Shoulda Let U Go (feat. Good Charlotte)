[Sean Kingston]
I'm losing my mind, 'cause she's one of a kind
Oh, she's so fine, gotta make her mine
Everything I do is only for you, 'cause you're my boo
Yes it's so true

My heart is so broken it's splitting in two
Looking so sad 'cause I'm feeling so through
Missing the days of being with you
'Cause I was stuck to you, girl
Feel like I'm trapped and I cannot get loose
'Cause I'm so lost I don't know what to do
Yeah, I'm so bad and I'm confused, but I'm still stuck to you, girl

[Joel Madden]
'Cause even when I meet you, yeah I knew I couldn't have you
I knew that I would try, and mess it up, what can I do?
And even when you're gone and all my friends all say I'm crazy
Say it ain't right, I want you to have my baby

Oh, Shoulda let you go [x3]
Let you go

[Sean Kingston]
Now I'm sitting home, feeling all alone
Wish you had a clone, 'cause girl you got me gone
Here in this chair, wishing you was here
But now it's getting clear, that you don't even care

My heart is so broken it's splitting in two
Looking so sad 'cause I'm feeling so through
Missing the days of being with you
'Cause I was stuck to you, girl
Feel like I'm trapped and I cannot get loose
'Cause I'm so lost I don't know what to do
Yeah, I'm so bad and I'm confused, but I'm still stuck to you, girl

[Joel Madden]
'Cause even when I meet you, yeah I knew I couldn't have you
I knew that I would try, and mess it up, what can I do?
And even when you're gone and all my friends all say I'm crazy
Say it ain't right, I want you to have my baby

Oh, Shoulda let you go [x3]
Let you go

But if I walked away, I know you'd come crawling back
You're playing hard to get, and I know it's all just an act

'Cause even when I meet you, yeah I knew I couldn't have you
I knew that I would try, and mess it up, what can I do?
And even when you're gone and all my friends all say I'm crazy
Say it ain't right, I want you to have my baby

Oh, Shoulda let you go [x3]
Let you go

Let you go go go go
