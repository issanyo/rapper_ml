Looking through my double XL, King Magazine
Flipping through the first pages, Looking for a Queen
Reading all the little things, interesting
Comments mentioning all the little bickering
About when we kicked it, Times was the business
Playboy magazine all around my kitchen
Front page Vixen and that's my love
If you see me cuffin hard with her it's only because...

[Legacy]
You lighten up my mood, even when you make your mad face
If I called you beautiful, it must have been your bad day
Since you left your ex, all your friends think I'm bogus
You got your nails done, I bet your ex wouldn't notice
Swag on point, She don't shop at all the local spots
Without makeup, she look like she been photoshopped
You had a deal, you'll get Marbury millz
If you on the front cover, you'll be off every shelf
