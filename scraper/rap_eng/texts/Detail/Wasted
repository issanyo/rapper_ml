[Hook]
You only want my time when you're wasted
You only hit my line when you're wasted
You tell me you love me when you're wasted
I'm only on your mind when you're wasted

[Post-Hook]
Now tell me would you? (waste it)
Would you, would you...
My time, my time
Would you...my time, my time
Would you waste (waste it)
My time, my time
My time, my time
(Waste it)

[Verse 1]
What's up, where you at? You know I need that
You fuck me drunk, the next day ask for feedback
You say you love me, boy I don't believe that
You say I fuck with you man, don't repeat that
I know what you do, I know what you do
Tell me when you're drunk, tell me when you're through
(Wasted)
And you always on that late shit
You only wanna call me when you're wasted
I like you sober, I like your sober
When you wasted you reckless, nobody told you
No, nobody told you
When you on that bottle, boy I can not hold you
You on that bottle you say you don't need me
You on that bottle you say shit so easy
I understand it, I see how you plan it
First you get drunk then you go to demanding
That over the top shit, this how you feel
This how you feel, this-this how you feel
Next day it's waters and Advil
This how you heal, this how you heal

[Hook]
You only want my time when you're wasted
You only hit my line when you're wasted
You tell me you love me when you're wasted
I'm only on your mind when you're wasted

[Post-Hook]
Now tell me would you? (waste it)
My time, my time
My time, my time
Tell, tell me would you?  (waste it)
My time, my time
My time, my time
Tell, tell me would you?

[Verse 2]
You take it straight and you swallow, uh huh
Drink it down 'til it's empty, that's when you say that you holla
(Tell me would you?)
You ain't pour up a chaser, now you chasing the models
Shit I think that nigga like me cause I'm shaped like a bottle
(Tell me would you?)
See, yeah, he hit me up when he want sex
Like "Bae I need you, I won't flex" (I need that)
2 A.M that blowing up with them missed calls and them drunk texts
Pull up on that fat wet-wet, put him out, yeah, that bed rest
And he'll wake up that next day looking at me like, what sex?
The Jamison, the Remy, then the Hennesy
Lately I can't tell if you in it or you into me (I don't even know man)
I really wanna give him one more shot
But all he really wanna do is take one more shot, damn

[Hook]
You only want my time when you're wasted
You only hit my line when you're wasted
You tell me you love me when you're wasted
I'm only on your mind when you're wasted
(Tell me would you?)

[Bridge]
Drowning in your liquor
Found you in your feelings
Telling me to come and get you
Say, don't bring nobody with you
I feel so emotional
Oh, waste of time loving you
Waste of time loving you

[Hook]
You only want my time when you're wasted
You only hit my line when you're wasted
You tell me you love me when you're wasted
I'm only on your mind when you're wasted

[Post-Hook]
Tell me would you?
My time, my time
My time, my time
Tell, tell me would you?  (waste it)
My time, my time
My time, my time
Tell, tell me would you?
