[Intro]
We are the fire, weâ€™re burning brighter
Who burning brighter, we burning brighter
Block the wall

[Verse 1]
When I'm alone, I'm alone
You're always on my mind, on my mind
And when it's dark, when it's dark
You know we always shine
You never leave
Cause I would never give you up, give you up, give you up
You're everything I need
I could never get enough, get enough, get enough

[Chorus]
You're my gasoline, I'm your lighter
Together baby we can burn brighter
Be my candle baby, I'll be your fire
Together baby we can burn brighter
Together baby we can burn brighter
Burn brighter, burn brighter, burn....
(Block the wall) Burn brighter

[Verse 2]
It's hitting me slow, get me hot all through the night
I'm 'bout to explode, loud like dynamite
Oh we know I never get enough
Feeling the heat, you know I love bright enough

[Chorus]
You're my gasoline, I'm your lighter
Together baby we can burn brighter
Be my candle baby, I'll be your fire
Together baby we can burn brighter
Together baby we can burn brighter
Burn brighter, burn brighter, burn....
(Block the wall) Burn brighter

[Post-Chorus]
Bottles of fire, we don't need no water
We are the fire and we burnin' brighter
(Burn bright)
Bottles of fire, we don't need no water
We are the fire and we burnin' brighter
(Burn bright)
Bottles of fire, we don't need no water
We are the fire and we burnin' brighter
We burnin' brighter, we make it brighter
(Together baby we can burn bright)
Bottles of fire, we don't need no water
We are the fire and we burnin' brighter
(Burn bright)
Bottles of fire, we don't need no water
We are the fire and we burnin' brighter
(Burn bright)

[Post-Chorus]
We are the fire boy we are the fight
If we got love there is no denying
You got my fire that's one in the same
Light with the fire go out with a bang
Bang bang
Bang bang
Out with the
Bang bang
Out with the, out with the bang

[Outro]
Still hearts that beat together
Spark and burn forever
Let it burn let the light shine
We'll serve light in the night time
Still hearts that beat together
Spark and burn forever
Let it burn let the light shine
We'll serve, serve serve serve serve serve light
