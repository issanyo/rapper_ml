[Intro: Future]
Choppa Choppa blang, he a coppa too
Ain't gonna say no names, he a rapper too

[Chorus: French Montana]
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Hoppin' out foreign cars, 40 deep
Hundred thou' blowin' that in AOD
And that's why I'm the best, fuck with me
'Cause a nigga flip flop like he standin' on the beach
Hoppin' up stage, got my diamonds, dirty dancin'
You know I work dirty, got 'em higher than a parasail
Tell my other bitch I'm on my other bitch, yeah
I just do that shit to make my other bitch jealous
Brodie in the kitchen and then he whippin' up the dressin'
Every time you call, I be like, look, lil hoe, don't stress me
You know I tuck the 9, like a motherfuckin' ferris wheel
You want it? You can get it if you wanna learn your lesson

[Chorus: French Montana]
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no

[Verse 2: Future]
Became friends with a dope head (dope head)
To be inside the mind of a dope head
How many crimes in a dope hit?
I got that one time for the dope heads
The people of the streets vs. the feds, yeah
Count it' 'til your thumb numb, hell yeah
Printin' like a money presser, hell yeah
You can smell the Franklins in the air, yeah
Put you in the loop, I make my own laws
Last six summers, we had no falls
And we still stashin' hundreds in the brick walls
Paid my dog commissary almost no cost

[Chorus: French Montana]
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no

[Verse 3: French Montana & Future]
Choppers, choppers, bang, they was lookin' for me
Ain't gon' say no names, probably lookin' for me
Choppers, choppers, bang, they was lookin' for me
Ain't gon' say no names, probably lookin' for me
Choppers, choppers, bang, he a copper, too
Ain't gon' say no names, he a robber, too
Choppers, choppers, bang, he a copper, too
Ain't gon' say no names, he a robber, too

[Chorus: French Montana]
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
You don't want no pressure, you don't want no pressure
