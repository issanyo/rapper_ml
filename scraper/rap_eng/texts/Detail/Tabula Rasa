[Verse 1: San Williams]

Walking past still waters in Ithaca’s valley
Smokin on that burning bush exodus Cali
Feeling like, all my joints invincible
Stans rolling that vintage Cavs and Berettas flow
Elegance is the presence
This shit right here feel like tambourines, Sunday’s best, and reverends
Clash of the Titans whenever I see my reflection
Got me reflecting and stressing about old friends who you know would take a bullet for you
Same ones who fire shots so it’s suicide too!
And I can't help but feel guilty for the past
The mask that I’m wearing was jealousy
And now you're telling me you miss me from the other side
How was I gon let it slide ugh!

This shit remind me of my Honda Civic
That shit remind me how I never hit it
I wasn't the type to stress and fall in love
Man It’s hard to admit, it’s hard to admit, man it’s hard to admit it
I’m mixing drinks to separate the pain
I miss the tears like dessert miss the rain
I miss, I really miss my Granddad
I miss believing Ma when she say “It’s okay.”
I miss not always worrying about my Grandma thinking
God will make a way, God will make a way ugh
Tears on my dinner plate
Fears in my mental state
And time is not an option when you broke as fuck
It’s hard for us to split the pain so fuck they loving us!

No rehearsal
Reversal I do it how i do it all the time
Cause they gon hearse you if they see you past your curfew
We're all “hood niggas” to them so they hurt you
And you a part of me so man I feel your pain
To them we're enemies which make us all feel the same
I’m tired of feeling inhumane you know you feel insane
When institutions built to break you down like they were fucking playing
JENGA!

[Bridge: San Williams]

And we ain't relatives
I feel like all of y'all my relatives
But this struggle shit
That shit ain't relative
Look me in my pain and see how real it is
