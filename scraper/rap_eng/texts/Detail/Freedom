[Intro]
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes man, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free

[Verse 1]
From Senegal, West Africa
To St. Louis, Missouri
Thanks to Katherine Dunham
For giving my pops his glory
He came down with his drum
And a dream to change the world
In a free uplifting world
And that's all he ever want
Mom came a little after
Gave birth to my brother
Then all of the pressure
Made 'em fight one another
See the pain would never last
Did the best with what they had
He knew the world was out for grabs
And he searched to find his

[Hook]
Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes man, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free
So I search to find my
Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes girl, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free, yea

[Verse 2]
As a kid I never knew
I'd have to hustle just to make it through
So I found myself skipping school
Cause the girls don't think I'm cool
And because of that I didn't care
Whether or not I went to jail
I just wanna be treated fair
Cause that's all I ever knew
Telling me I need to slow down
Cause everybody in the whole town
Cause they know how I get down
Foreigner from another town
Can you believe we still around?
After so many hit the ground
And we ain't gone stop now
Until we get that

[Hook]
Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes man, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free
Won't stop 'til I find my
Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes girl, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free

[Bridge]
If you wanna be free, and the land is drug free
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, from all your misery
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, with plenty money
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna be free, just praise G O D
Put your hands up, put your hands up

[Hook]
Freedom (x4)
Everything I have, everything I own
All my mistakes girl, you already know
I wanna be free, I wanna be free, yea (echo...)
