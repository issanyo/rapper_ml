[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, yeah, haha
It's Travie, Detail whaddup?
Here we go, let's go

[Chorus: Kesha & (Travie McCoy)]
I love the crazy things you do
'Cause tonight's the night for me to play the fool
And the mood is right, plus you're so polite
(But you know that I really want you
Girl you know that I really want you)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
I'm sittin' here thinkin' about ways to confront you
Then dreaming 'bout how its gon' feel when I touch you
Girl, you know I really want you
You know how bad I really want you
But make it easy on me (damn)
Take is easy on me (c'mon)
I'm fragile from girls in the past that did nothin'
But frontin' that crazy on me
But I can tell that you different
Swagger, brand new like an infant
Don't lie and act like you ain't tempted
To be honest with you, I'm kinda offended
See, I understand the policy
The least you can do is acknowledge me
You're harder to read than Japanese
And that look on your face is just screaming, "don't bother me"

[Chorus: Kesha & (Travie McCoy)]
I love the crazy things you do
'Cause tonight's the night for me to play the fool
And the mood is right, plus you're so polite
(But you know that I really want you
Girl you know that I really want you)
I really, really, really, really want you bad
Your lips got a smile that ain't ever sad
You bad bad boy, I ain't ever mad at you
(But you know that I really want you
Girl you know that I really want you)
At you, boy

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Now give me some sort of sign
Just somethin' so I can be sure that you're mine
Now before you start lyin'
Just ask yourself, am I really that fine?
I happen to think that you are
In fact, I'm convinced that you're an angel
That somehow fell from the sky
You fly, but I don't get your angle
Now we can sit here and pretend
Like the feelings you have are non-existent
But it's so obvious you're dying inside to be my princess
Look at you now, you smilin'
But earlier you was whilin'
Like "I wouldn't fuck with that dude
If we was stuck on a deserted island"
(Oh, that's how you feel?)

[Chorus: Kesha & (Travie McCoy)]
I love the crazy things you do
'Cause tonight's the night for me to play the fool
And the mood is right, plus you're so polite
(But you know that I really want you
Girl you know that I really want you)
I really, really, really, really want you bad
Your lips got a smile that ain't ever sad
You bad bad boy, I ain't ever mad at you
(But you know that I really want you
Girl you know that I really want you)
At you, boy

[Bridge: Kesha]
I love the crazy things you do
Do something oh so naughty, cool
Tonight I'm gonna play the fool
So what, I wanna get with you

[Chorus: Kesha & (Travie McCoy)]
I love the crazy things you do
'Cause tonight's the night for me to play the fool
And the mood is right, plus you're so polite
(But you know that I really want you
Girl you know that I really want you)
I really, really, really, really want you bad
Your lips got a smile that ain't ever sad
You bad bad boy, I ain't ever mad at you
(But you know that I really want you
Girl you know that I really want you)
I ain't ever mad at you, boy
