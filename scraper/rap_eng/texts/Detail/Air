[Verse 1]
Right there where you are
Can't stop looking at you
You look so good to me
And i don't have to lie to ya
You be on your toosh
You are my fantasy
Ooh, lovely as you are
Your such a star
The sky can't shut you down
The fact you're all over me
I just can't let you leave
Ooo baby you take me higher, higher, higher

[Chorus]
Cause you don't have to look around
You don't need to put your head down
Just look up, up in the sky, yea
Cause girl you know you got me
You knock me right off my feet
And show me, how to fly
In the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air (hey! hey!)
Girl, you know you put me
In the air, in the air, in the air, in the air, in the air (hey!)
I'm waitin' for you in the air

Not that it matters

You don't need to put your head down
Just look up, up in the sky, yea

As they fade and away
But you know I'm here to stay
When you need it, I got it
