[Intro: Swae Lee]
Don't judge me
EarDrummers

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
On the liqs right now don't judge me
Right now, off a bean don't judge me
I might pop a seal in the morning
Lately, I've been goin' through a lot of things
On the liqs right now don't judge me
Blow the whole pound, don't judge me, yeah
I don't want it if it ain't a two-piece, yeah
Lately, I've been goin' through a lot of things

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla Sign]
Lately, I've been goin' through a lot of things, yeah
Came up from the mud to the finer things, yeah
I can't trust no one, I can't trust nobody now
Only thing they want, only thing they want is money now
Rollie flood the VVS, 50 on my neck
Made a mil' out of nothing, made it all out of nothing
Gucci like yeah, Saint Laurent like yeah
Diamonds all VVS, day ones right here

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
On the liqs right now don't judge me
Right now I'm off a bean don't judge me
I might pop a seal in the morning
Lately, I've been goin' through a lot of things
On the liqs right now don't judge me
Blow the whole pound, don't judge me, yeah
I don't want it if it ain't a two-piece, yeah
Lately, I've been goin' through a lot of things

[Verse 2: Future]
I've been on the liqs, don't judge me (don't judge me)
Let me have a threesome if you love me (you love me)
Don't you look at me like you can't trust me (you can't trust me)
Lately, I've been going through some things (lately I've been goin' through)
I've been doing drugs, don't judge me (don't you judge me)
Right now, on the mud, don't judge me (I'm on a yeah)
Let me have my fun with this two-piece, yeah
That shiny molly got me Chinese

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
On the liqs right now don't judge me
Right now off a bean don't judge me
I might pop a seal in the morning
Lately, I've been goin' through a lot of things
On the liquor right now don't judge me
Blow the whole pound, don't judge me, yeah
I don't want it if it ain't a two-piece, yeah
Lately, I've been goin' through a lot of things

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
I can squeeze like three in the front seat (front seat)
Ferrari just forgot about the back seats (back seat)
Liquored down, hell yeah, don't judge me (Judge me)
She said, one day your gonna love me (love me)
Hard work pays off, trust me (Pays off)
Sober as I am, don't touch me (Touch me)
Seeming like the drugs is saying flush me
Every day, I plan on getting lucky
Chase more cuz' my niggas on a high streak
So, we need five tables in Hibachi
I might put it on her in a hurry
Paid in full, so I'm not guilty

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
On the liqs right now don't judge me
Right now off a bean don't judge me
I might pop a seal in the morning
Lately, I've been goin' through a lot of things
On the liqs right now don't judge me
Got a whole pound, don't judge me, yeah
I don't want it if it ain't a two-piece, yeah
Lately, I've been goin' through a lot of things

[Outro: Future]
Go ahead, some lies on your face
What about him, you didn't love him anyway
Look how much you made
Goes for you but not look shit, you got tricks up your sleeve
Take you to the Hills to fuck on your face
Love you more than the drugs that I take
Neglection from the underworld got you virally
Still falling from the same game you fell for privately
You ought to be where you say you are, but roses don't grow overnight
You took a few bites, I didn't think you was aight
I'll try to get over in my afterlife, this life right here ain't aight
I don't even know how I fell for your type, but, this shit aight
