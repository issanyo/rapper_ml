[Intro]

[Hook]
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
Pussy nigga, we made it
Pussy nigga, we made it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
Pussy nigga, we made it
Pussy nigga, we made it

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
The Audi, Bugatti, Ferrari, the Masi
The Bentley, the Fisker, the Jag, the Rover
With a bad bitch like Hova
My wrist it be spinning and spinning like it got a motor
Fifty bricks in the Toyota, trapping off the motorola!
Through this same time, it was last year
Migo gang still with the top,  Migo gang
Niggas wasn't fucking with me
Now they wanna fuck with me
Cause they see on tv in that Versace
I know that they hate it, I know that they hate it
I know that they praying we won't make it
Momma told me, "Son, you gon be the greatest
And you know that you gon always have haters."
16 stuffing zips in my windbreaker
Hanging with the OGs and the killers
Then that windbreaker turned to a chinchilla
No limit money nigga like I signed with Percy Miller
Whipping it, whipping that Hitler then hop in that Fisker

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
It was all a dream like Biggy
Grind hard, committed, Migo gang lieutenant
Lost a lot, now we winning
From the Hondas to Bentleys
First of all I wanna say ... fuck the feds
Wanna see a nigga locked up or dead
Straight up out the county, straight to the fortune
Remember back in the day broke on the porches
Smokin gas, sipping mud, driving in them Porsches
Now we traveling the world like a fucking orbit
Thousand dollars pair Giuseppes, no more rocking Jordans
Fully loaded Rolex for my son, Jordan
Now he looking up to daddy like my daddy important
Rolls Royce or the Maybach, that’s boss choices
Kick this shit like I'm Chuck "Offset" Norris
Rasputia my pockets they fat, don't mistake me for Norbit
WHOA!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Ever since day 1, had to juug some
Momma told me, 'better not run into these houses son"
What you mean ma? We gotta keep the lights on
She said, "Quavo you might run into the wrong one"
It was 2 years ago, it feel like it was yesterday
Task force around my house looking for a case
Turning on the channel news then I see my face
Turn myself in cause I know my lawyer beat the case
Then we dropped Bando, hoes go loco
How dare a nigga ever disrespect the Migos
Could see that hater look in the eyes, the way we hit em by surprise
Cause we blowing up like inner tube tires
Now look at my life rocking the ice, rocking the mic
Now my hoes a different color, looking like Mike & Ikes
(Versace!) Damn right I changed my life
I hope I motivated young niggas to get their money right
Now this is for the people let em know that we some young rich niggas
Now this is for the people let em know that we got way more than one hit single
GONE!
Young Rich Niggas 2 ...
It's a blessing ...
From us to you ...
