[Intro]
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

[Verse 1]
Been waitin' on that sunshine, boy
I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You yell, but cha take me back
Who cares, when it feels like crack?
Boy, ya know that you always do it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, fuck yo pride
Just take it on back, boy, take it on back, boy
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what cha gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurtin' vibe, man, it hurts inside when I look you in yo eye

[Chorus]
What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do
(Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you’re willing to do
(Kiss it, kiss it better, baby)

[Verse 2]
Been waitin' on that sunshine, boy
I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You here, here to take me back
Who cares, when it feels like crack?
Boy, ya know that you always do it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, fuck yo pride
Just take it on back, boy, take it on back, boy
Take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
