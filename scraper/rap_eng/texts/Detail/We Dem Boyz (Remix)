[Verse 1: Alec The Human]
Hol up, Hol up, Hol up I'm that boy (Okay)
Killing all these beats, I destroy (Yeah)
When this comes on you better make some noise (Make some noise)
You better play this shit like a fucking toy (Play with it)
Killing shit just like a plumber (Mario)
Louds got me acting like Dumb & Dumber (Really though)
One of them nights I won't remember (Turn up)
Hol' up, what's this number? (Does she look good)
We Dem Boyz and we smoke a lot (Smoke)
Don't pass me a cig I'm only pot (Nope)
You think them facts are true but they're really not (Nah)
Got five bitches on me and they're really hot (Classy bitch)

[Verse 2: Alec The Human]
Hol' up, Hol' up, Hol' up I'm trying to smoke (Trying to smoke)
Don't pass me that shit if it ain't dope (I love dope)
You ain't fucking with my shit, nope (Hell no)
One hit of this shit and it's your last hope (Last hope)
Pass me a bowl or bong you can't go wrong (Never wrong)
If it's rolled up you can bet it's thick and long (Damn)
Eyes fucked up, call me Mr. Wong (I ain't Chinese)
Blowing clouds of smoke like Cheech & Chong (Hell yea)
No bottles over here, don't pass me a beer (Fuck no)
I smoke so much you thought I was gonna disappear (Yea bro)
I smoke a blunt and then I put it in her rear (Nice)
Looking forward to the future cause the smoke is near
(Damn man, you really killed this one)
