[Chorus: Detail & Future]
Girl, I've been there for you
And you know that it's true
You know it's true, you know it's true
Girl, I've been there for you
I've been there, I've been there for you
Girl, you know that it's true
Aw yeah, out here getting it baby

[Verse 1: Future]
Never ever let the money stop
Dirty police trying to fuck it up
If money come, he wanna pull you over
Just to say something under there
Baby momma' back drinking liquor
Now she trying to fuck my life up
I'm out here to get this money baby
37, throwin' dice up
Long nights of the wake up
New check, fuck my life up
Anytime I'm in a new city
I prefer to do light drugs
Police try to hit the tour bus
Try and fuck a nigga life up
You can fuck a nigga life up
By trying to fuck a nigga wife once
Told you baby this business
Please stop tryna ruin it all
Money fucked a nigga life up
New rims, new tires
Just get out here and show it off
Next, I'mma take the doors off
Whip browner than a band-aid
Take the sore off
Money coming so fast

[Chorus: Detail & Future]
Girl, I've been there for you
Money coming, money coming so fast
And you know that it's true
You know it's true, you know it's true
Girl, I've been there for you
I've been there, I've been there for you
And you know that it's true

[Post Chorus: Detail & Future]
You know I'm out here getting it baby
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Ball hard, and I'm still balling
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Money coming stu-stupid fast
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Getting money and I count it all
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Ohhh fuck my life up
(It's true)

[Verse 2: Future]
Eight stacks sitting in the club
Swipe my credit card, fuck my life up
These drugs gave me my light up
Told her "Baby please, don't bite it"
I ain't had sex in a whole week
Just so you can get to know me
Gushy, gush, so soaky
I put it in, go so deep
Motherfuck how far you
Come over here and get the write up
Homeowners' association, they always tryna get right up
You got a better advantage
You always use xannies whenever you plan it
Pussy be fucking my life up, and yet at the same time its giving me stamina
My role model fucked my life up
Two bitches in the same room, no light on
So easy getting 100 thousand when the night up
Got cake cookin' up cake bake
My life fucked for a ladies bit
83 to 88, money comes so fast

[Chorus: Future]
Girl, I've been there for you
Money coming, money coming so fast
And you know that it's true
Girls it's true
Girl, I've been there for you
And you know that it's true

[Post Chorus: Detail & Future]
Know I'm out here getting it baby
Why you tryna to fuck my life up
Ball hard, and I'm still balling
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Money coming stu-stupid fast
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Getting money, then I count it all
Stop trying to fuck my life up
Ohhh fuck my life up, ohhhh
Fuck my life up
