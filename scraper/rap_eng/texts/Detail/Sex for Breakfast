[Verse 1]
Tossin' and turnin' makes my appetite keep growing stronger
All night long
Anticipating mornin' light and I can't wait much longer
Feels so strong

[Pre-Chorus]
Our bodies touchin', I just can't get enough
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh
Won't let you sleep, I gotta satisfy my needs
I need to love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh

[Chorus]
And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside
And even though we made sweet love all night
I need sex for breakfast, it feels so right

[Verse 2]
Might be late for work
But I promise that it's worth it, baby, don't go
So hungry for you, taste me and I'll taste you
There's no stopping what I'll do to get you in the mood

[Pre-Chorus]
Our bodies touchin', I just can't get enough
I wanna love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh
Won't let you sleep, I gotta satisfy my needs
I need to love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, eh

[Chorus]
And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside
And even though we made sweet love all night
I need sex for breakfast, it feels so right

[Bridge]
And I can see break of day begin through the curtains
And I'm so certain
Soon I'm gonna feel your honey drip, my juices start to flow
A strawberry cream is like a dream, my fantasy is reality
When the morning comes, I know that I will too

[Chorus]
And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind (I need it)
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside (stay inside me, baby)
And even though we made sweet love all night (we made sweet love)
I need sex for breakfast, it feels so right (it feels so good inside)
And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside (I need it, I want it when the morning comes)
And even though we made sweet love all night (we made love all night)
I need sex for breakfast, it feels so right

[Outro]
So hungry for you
Taste me, and I'll taste you
Alright
Sex for breakfast
All done
Sex for breakfast (feels so right)
