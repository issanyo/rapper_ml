[Hook]
I ain't lovin' you no more
When the check come I'm through with that ho
Man I'm tellin' you
There ain't nothin' else you can do with that ho
Check come, Weight Watch, I'm through with that ho
Wait watch, I'm through with that ho
Check come in, Weight Watch, I'm through with that ho
Nothin' else you can do with that ho
Nothin' else, nothin' else

[Verse 1]
Niggas chop, pop, (?), ain't y'all worried bout it?
No baby mama's, just kiss her, she ain't gotta worry bout it
Good mornin's apologies, she heard about it
Cat right there ain't hard to feed ain't scurred about it
Sittin' right next to that dank of G's
Try to iron all the shit out to like 20 creases
Me and my niggas go way back, got a million secrets
These days can't go to sleep, get caught sleepin'

[Bridge]
I ain't lovin' you no more
Check come I'm through with that ho
I ain't lovin' you no more
Check come I'm through with that ho
Man I'm through with that ho
Man I'm through with that ho
Check come I'm through with that ho
Man I'm through with that ho
Through with that ho
Through with that ho
Through with that ho
Through with that ho
Check come I'm through with that ho

[Verse 2]
Got two bitches, 100 grand a piece
Slick Rick James, Mona Lisa
Once I cop the check she ain't gotta lease it
I be thinkin' bout my son like I gotta teach him
Man I fell in love for her mama rose
Once the check came I bought another road
Shit gotta paid, ah
Rent can't be late, ah

[Bridge]
Once the check come I'm through with that ho
She's still my ho
