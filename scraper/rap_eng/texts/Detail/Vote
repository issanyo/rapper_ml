[Intro]
Good time, vote for that
Good time, vote for that
Good time, vote for that
Good time, vote for that
Good time, vote for that
Good time, vote for that
Good time, vote for that
Good time, vote for that
I've got that feeling, the feeling too easy
As long as I'm breathing, I've gotta vote for a good time

[Verse 1]
Tag your name across the sky
Breathe it in and we can fly
Not for love and not for likes
Yeah, so let's vote
Like you just got paid, spend it all on Mary Jane
It's a celebration, yeah, so I vote
Oh, and everything changing
It's got me feeling strange, but we can stand together
Yeah, so just vote
Summer nights that we were wild
Make the choice that makes you proud
Make the choice that makes you proud
Yeah, and vote for a good time

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for tequila, two times for sativa
[?]

[Chorus]
Vote for a good time
Yeah, oh, good time, alright
Good time, good time
La la la la la la la la la, yeah
Vote for a good time

[Verse 2]
So much beauty into nothing, sometimes life is ugly
We are all searching for something
So let's vote
Late night don't wait
Make the choice that sets you free now
And that's [?] your mind, you'll be fine if you just vote
Tag your name across the sky
Breathe it in and we can fly
Not for love and not for likes
For the moments we'll remember
And the people that we treasure
We can keep it all together, oh
Vote for a good time

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for tequila, two times for sativa
[?]
One time for tequila, two times for sativa
[?]
Vote for a good time

[Chorus]
Good time, good time
Good time, yeah yeah yeah
Vote for a good time, good time
La la la la la la la la la, oh
Oh, I vote, oh, I vote
Vote for a good time, good time
You know I know I know
Oh, good time, alright
Vote for a good time, good time
La la la la la la la la la, yeah
Oh, I vote, oh, I vote
Vote for a good time, good time
You know I know I know
Oh, good time, alright
Vote for a good time, good time
La la la la la la la la la, yeah
Let's vote for a good time

[Outro]
[?] I don't wanna say bye
Oh, I can see you same time tomorrow night, yeah
Right now feels like the greatest of our lives
It's you and I
