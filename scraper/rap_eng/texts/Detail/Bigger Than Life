[Intro: Chris Brown & (Birdman)]
Look around, is this where you wanna be, yeah? (Yeah, yeah)
This shit bigger than life and we ain't gotta play around, no, no, no, no (YMCMB, nigga)
And when the sun come up we gon' be alright
Speak up on it, baby, I'ma get it alright (fully loaded)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Birdman]
I want you to know this is, we are bigger than life
I am my brother's keeper, nigga, million dollar view, flashy lifestyle, yeah
Ooh, when the sun goes down we gon' be alright, this is, we are bigger than life
I do shine, nigga, 100

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, the city love me every night
When you winnin' to the fans, it ain't hard to decide
She know we fly, she pick a flight in no time
I'll be by my own business, why you busy mindin' mine?
You was on my level, we both came from the ghetto
And later we're separated, we hate it, I'm glad you made it
When your mountain top they say there's nowhere to go but down
But I'll be chillin', just look around
Perpendicular, momma be straight forever
Her crib about an hour, now she an out-of-towner
Predicted it be better, we change the game like quarters
Two dimes together, they high five until whatever
I can mention your name but I rather keep it clever
YMCMB, I tell ya every letter
She just wanna chill with a star, feel special
No stressin' no pressure, I'll bless you, bigger than

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Tyga)]
This is we are bigger than life, bigger than life (yeah, yeah)
Bigger than life, this is, we are bigger than life
Bigger than life, ooh, when the sun goes down we gon' be alright
This is, we are bigger than life

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah, money on the grind, money on my mind
Do it big time, Junior head line
Big money nigga, hustle hundreds nigga
Old school nigga, hundred mill nigga
Chandelier lights, Persian on the rug
Roberta for the bitch, nine for the plug
Count a hundred G's, fifty on the piece
Cookin' up some ki's, flip it with some B's
Yeah, every day the same grind
Up late nights, nigga tryna flip mine
Born to shine, plaques on every shelf
Blind any weather nigga with the Smith and Wess (braaap)
Million on the whip nigga, shit
Gucci bag full of chips nigga
Yeah, and I got this game off the flow
Movin' bricks on the low, hundred G's for the throw (pound for pound)
Yeah, Uptown off the mound, nigga
Shredded down put it down, put it in every town, nigga (high life)
Big money stay poppin'
Uptown real nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
This is we are bigger than life, bigger than life
Bigger than life, this is, we are bigger than life (we're bigger than life)
Bigger than life, ooh, when the sun goes down we gon' be alright
This is, we are bigger than life

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, smokin' on the good
Killin' these hoes like Blair Underwood
Dreads in the wind, blowin' like a ribbon
Gettin' money like a bitch, um, Robin Givens
God is my chauffeur, take to my destiny
White girl, black girl, I call that a referee
I'm definitely alive, bullshit aside
Red flag in my pocket, I caught a bulls-eye
I ain't never gave a fuck about another motherfucker
Every night that I pray to God that I don't kill a undercover
Word to my mother, give the world to my mother
I swear when my momma die, that's when I'ma die
Fuck bitches, get money, Young Money go hard
Skate hard, big B's no honey
Got that drop top Maybach, smellin' like payback
Payback, uh

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
This is, we are
Look around, is this where you wanna be, yeah?
This shit bigger than life and we ain't gotta play around, no no, no no
And when the sun come up we gon' be alright, yeah
Speak up on it, baby, I'ma get it alright 'cause I want you to know

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Birdman]
This is we are bigger than life, bigger than life, yeah
Bigger than life, this is, we are bigger than life (we are, life, life)
Sticks on deck, stars do shine, nigga, I am my brother's keeper, braaap
Bigger than life, ooh, when the sun goes down we gon' be alright
This is, we are bigger than life
