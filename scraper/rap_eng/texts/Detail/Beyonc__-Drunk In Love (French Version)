[Couplet 1: Beyoncé]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal
With these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, now-now
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Refrain: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grinding up in that club, drunk in love

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Couplet 2: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood
Graining-graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving-swerving on that
Big body been serving all this
Swerve, surfing all in this good-good

[Pre-Refrain: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grinding up in that club, drunk in love

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Interlude: Jay Z]
I'm nice right now… Hold up!

[Couplet 3: Jay Z]
That D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Pont: Beyoncé]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking, watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
