[Pre-Hook]
This a picture, what a picture
I'm fuckin' with you, tell that nigga he ain't with you
I'm so horny, I'm so horny
Whatever I gotta do to tell you good mornin'

[Hook]
Good mornin'
Somehow I'm feelin' so close to you baby
I'm fuckin' with you, baby, good mornin'
We be all night
Baby, good mornin', mornin'
Every time I see her I swear we get deeper and deeper
Good mornin'
We be all night
Baby, good mornin'

[Verse 1]
She do me plenty favors, you always on your worst behavior
She callin' me just to save her, I'm far from ordinary so I cater
Million dollar [?], I know she can get it certain
Give her diamonds and pearls, I know her sex as good as her curse
Girl I rarely brag on love, I rarely ever get hurt
You all under my arm while I'm all under your skirt
Girl your angel wings so controllable
Girl your essence is so damn adorable
Girl be patient, watch it happen, it is what it is
You always wake first, give what you give

Somehow I'm feelin' so close to you baby
I'm fuckin' with you, baby, good mornin'
We be all night
Baby, good mornin', mornin'
Every time I see her I swear we get deeper and deeper
Good mornin'
We be all night
Baby, good mornin'

[Verse 2]
Dangerous, dangerous
We made it and we happy and they mad at us
Good mornin', girl you're off the market
We done painted a portrait, we lookin' back at our fortune
We are love, we are love, are love
Ain't neither one of us perfect, we just scratchin' the surface
You would think we did it on purpose, I don't know if it's virtuous
I don't know if it hurts you, everything is worth it

I'm fuckin' with you, baby, good mornin'

Baby, good mornin', mornin'
Every time I see her I swear we get deeper and deeper
Good mornin'
We be all night
Baby, good mornin'
