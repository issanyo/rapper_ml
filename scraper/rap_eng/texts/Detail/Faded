[Pre-Chorus: Kim Petras]
They wanna squeeze you when you're warm
When it's cold, they ain't around
They crowd around you when you up
Then disappear when you get stuck

[Chorus: Kim Petras]
I stay faded every ni-i-ight
I stay faded every ni-i-ight
I stay faded, I ain't ly-i-in'
I stay faded, I ain't ly-i-in'
I stay faded every ni-i-i-i-ight
Stay faded every ni-i-i-i-ight
Faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-in'
Stay faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-in'


[Verse 1: Kim Petras]
Why they always want my time? (always want my time)
Ain't like we can rewind (like we can rewind)
And I ain't gonna lie (and I ain't gonna lie)
I'm faded out my mind (faded out my mind)
Faded every night (aded every night)
I can touch the sky (I can touch the sky)
I be too faded to drive (I be too faded to drive)
Every night, I'm on a flight (every night, I'm on a flight)
This is all about us (all about us)
Spend some money, live it up (spend some money, live it up)
They never saw when it was rough (rough, rough, rough)
Drop the top, then roll the windows up (roll the windows up)

[Pre-Chorus: Kim Petras]
They wanna squeeze you when you're warm
When it's cold, they ain't around
They crowd around you when you up
Then disappear when you get stuck

[Chorus: Kim Petras]
I stay faded every ni-i-ight
I stay faded every ni-i-ight
I stay faded, I ain't ly-i-in'
I stay faded, I ain't ly-i-in'
I stay faded every ni-i-i-i-ight
Stay faded every ni-i-i-i-ight
Faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-in'
Stay faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-in'

[Verse 2: Kim Petras]
Stay faded every ni-i-ight
Faded everyday (faded everyday)
That's the only way (that's the only way)
That's the, that's the only way (that's the only way)
In and out of different places (places, places)
But I can't see their faces (face at all)
They wanna love me 'cause I'm famous (famous-mous)
Can't nobody blame us, no (blame us)
And this is all about us (this is all about us)
Spend some money, live it up (live it, live it, up, up)
They never saw when it was rough (when it was rough, when it was rough)
Drop the top then roll the windows up (drop it, roll the windows up)

[Pre-Chorus: Kim Petras]
They wanna squeeze you when you're warm
When it's cold, they ain't around
They crowd around you when you up
Then disappear when you get stuck

[Chorus: Kim Petras]
I stay faded every ni-i-ight
I stay faded every ni-i-ight
I stay faded, I ain't ly-i-in'
I stay faded, I ain't ly-i-in'
I stay faded every ni-i-i-i-ight
Stay faded every ni-i-i-i-ight
Faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-in'
Stay faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-in'

[Verse 3: lil aaron]
Yeah, I stay faded, only smoking A-graded
Everybody fake as fuck, so I been self medicatin'
I'm the greatest that there was, and still the most underrated
That shit ain't up for discussion or debatin', know you hate it, yeah
Still I gotta get fucked up to have a good time
If there's something in my cup then it's a good night
I'm hittin' up the plug, tell 'em I'ma double up
I'ma need a couple blunts, make 'em double-stuffed

[Pre-Chorus: Kim Petras]
They wanna squeeze you when you're warm
When it's cold, they ain't around
They crowd around you when you up
Then disappear when you get stuck

[Chorus: Kim Petras]
I stay faded every ni-i-ight
I stay faded every ni-i-ight
I stay faded, I ain't ly-i-in'
I stay faded, I ain't ly-i-in' (I stay faded)
I stay faded every ni-i-i-i-ight
Stay faded every ni-i-i-i-ight
Faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-in'
Stay faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-in'

[Outro: Kim Petras]
Woo-ahh!
