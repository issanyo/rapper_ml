[Verse 1]
I’m gone for that yay yay
Shawty ass like yay yay
I pulled up in that yay yay
My wrist shining like yay yay
My money like yay yay
I was whipping that yay yay
Hit the dealer, pulled up in that yay yay
And now them hoes like yay yay
And now them hoes like yay yay

[Hook]
I’m gone for the yay yay
I hope the shit’s a yay yay
Drink it all, yay yay
Talk to me yay yay, yay yay
Left cheek, right cheek (yay yay, yay yay)
Left cheek, right cheek (yay yay, yay yay)
Left cheek, right cheek (yay yay, yay yay)
Left cheek, right cheek (yay yay, yay yay)

[Verse 2]
Shawty want a [?], yay yay
Had to say naw to the yay yay
Shawty smoking hard, sniffing yay yay
Shawty playing ball with the yay yays
Airport, flying out the yay yay
Shawty crying out yay yay
I make some cookies out the yay yay
And now them hoes like yay yay
And now them hoes like yay yay

[Hook]
I’m gone for the yay yay
I hope the shit’s a yay yay
Drink it all, yay yay

Left cheek, right cheek (yay yay, yay yay)
Left cheek, right cheek (yay yay, yay yay)
Left cheek, right cheek (yay yay, yay yay)
