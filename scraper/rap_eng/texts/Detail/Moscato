[Intro: Future]
Yeah yeah yeah
I want to fuck you on Moscato
Beat you, hit the lotto

[Hook: Future]
Red wine in the creases of your nipples
Fuck them two bitches, I'm going triple
Fuckin on Moscato
I know you wanna record me
Take your time and just enjoy me
This moment you can't afford me
The lord know that you get
You get a royalty
Fucking on Moscato
Tonight you hit the lotto

[Verse 1: Future]
Make sure you don't fuck up my name
I hope you came
David Blaine
I made your pain go away like a Vicodin
We take the rain, the thunder and the lightning
Ooohh, your spirit is monogamous
Wooohh, i'm taking away your oxygen
Fucking on Moscato
Tell your girlfriend, please, bring another bottle
Tell your girlfriend, she can go and stay tonight
They wanna go to Neverland, i put my gloves on
They wanna go to Neverland, get your tour on
Won't ride in the backseat of limos
No, no more
We Phantom and Maybachs when you open our doors
Let the curtains up
About to fuck her on Moscato
(About to fuck her on Moscato)

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 2: Detail]
Pantyhose off, let you doze off
Lay on the chinchilla baby, it's so soft
Cuz you're different
And when you're coming baby, it's magnificent
Oooh, the way you put it down girl, it's uplifting
Ooh let's climb up to the highest mountain and be
I wanna hear you speak, head to your feet
It's a lotta power in a Trojan
See, the choice of life is unspoken
Your pussy get wet off moscato
Girl you hit the lotto
Give you hollows in the backseat of my Tahoe
Shoulda left my truck on
Windows are electric, baby keep flexin
Get your fuck on
Then we go home
And take showers all night long
Candles with no lights on
Baby this the right song
I'm starting to see it clear
Me and you good money girl here
And don't take nothing but what you want

[Hook: Future]
