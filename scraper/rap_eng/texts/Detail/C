[Verse]
Almost all my idols getting shit up off their chest
Half of 'em say they're depressed, rest of 'em act like they're blessed
Honestly, who do I trust? Do I believe, it's a mess
I cannot see any less than what the people telling (yes)
Do I believe that my future's shining bright? Ask a God or two
They might reply by shining off their light, I would reply by saying
"tight" if I believed in the sky, there were some forces left and right
Tryna save my fucking life but there's not none
And if you try convince me otherwise, I'm off, done
If you try showing me that light, I'll let that cross burn
I'm sorry if I just offended what you lost, uh
But at the end of every day, I'll laugh it off, huh
I'm sorry if my sense of humour does offend you
I'm working on improving everything I can do
I'm losing people left and right, guess what, my friends who
Talk behind my back, just fuck 'em all, they like to rent room
Boy, I dunno, should I drop the alias?
Corey Rae's an alien to everybody, ain't he just?
No one knows a single thing about the fucker, crazy, huh?
I'm worried if I let 'em know, they'll leave and go replace me, uh
And that shit ain't an option, it's just not viable
Unless I have a feeling that it's justifiable
I'll keep it locked away, the fire burning, light it up
I'm focused on improving everything, no lying, 'cuz
If I did that, kept pushing out the shit rap
I'd wanna quit, lad, it's pointless if I mixed that
Fairly decent stuff I made with what I hate, witness that
Sudden change in everything I'm doing, I would quit rap
Yeah
