[Verse 1]
(Ooh) When I give, I give everything when I give it to you
(Ooh) No one can ever break, boy
It's driving me crazy, I'm missing you, baby
(Ooh) Can't believe what you done to me
Look at me, needing you, wanting you, closer
(Ooh) I'm trying and know that I'm trying to want you, just stay

[Pre-Chorus]
(Let's breathe) I'm tryna get over it baby, over it baby
(Let's breathe) Come and be with me, I need you

[Chorus]
No touchin', ain't no touchin' if I cannot touch on you
No kissin', ain't no kissin' if I cannot kiss on you
No laying, it ain't no laying if I cannot lay with you
No doin', it ain't no doing if I cannot do it with you

[Verse 2]
(Ooh) You so far away and it's driving me crazy
Come back to me, baby
(Ooh) I need it, I want it, you got it
Don't hold it, you give it, it's over
(Ooh) I never thought I would be feeling this way
But I messed up now, baby
(Ooh) I'm trying to make it
But it ain't that easy, I need you, you need me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Let's breathe) I'm tryna get over it, baby; over it baby
(Let's breathe) Come and be with me, I need you

[Chorus]
No touchin', ain't no touchin' if I cannot touch on you
No kissin', ain't no kissin if I cannot kiss on you
No laying, it ain't no laying if I cannot lay with you
No doin', it ain't no doing if I cannot do it with you

[Bridge]
Talk to me (Tell me want you want)
(What you want) It's all up to you
(All up to you) This ain't for no one else
(No one else) 'Cause It belongs to you

[Chorus]
No touchin', ain't no touchin' if I cannot touch on you
No kissin', ain't no kissin if I cannot kiss on you
No laying, it ain't no laying if I cannot lay with you
No doin', it ain't no doing if I cannot do it with you

No touchin', ain't no touchin' if I cannot touch on you
No kissin', ain't no kissin if I cannot kiss on you
No laying, it ain't no laying if I cannot lay with you
No doin', it ain't no doing if I cannot do it with you
