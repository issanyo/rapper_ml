[Intro]
Love that n-
Love that never ends
You...
You-u-u...

[Verse 1]
Can we pretend
That everything is like yesterday
What if I just wanna feel you touching me?
Ain't nobody perfect
So if you take a while to make it worth it
I wanna pretend
Let's pretend that we 'boutta break up
To catch the feelings that way we make up
Legs up, suicide, north side
We never count points when we courtside

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Let's pretend I ain't your friend
So we can get it on again
Let's pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Let's pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride, and learn to forgive
When I'm looking for love I pretend

[Chorus]
It's you
A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with

[Verse 2]
If we pretend that I'm happy when I'm really not
Pretend that I give you everything I've got
Pretend that I'm there when I ain't there
Pretend that I care when I don't care
Once upon a time, I did
Now I admit that I was fucking with a kid
Now I pretend that everything's straight
When everything ain't just covered up like paint

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let's pretend it's my first time
So you can really blow my mind
Let's pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Let's pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride, and learn to forgive
When I'm looking for love I pretend

[Chorus]
It's you
A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with

[Verse 3]
Tears used to hit by my pillow
Just be my enemy and I'm your hero
Lemme love you in the worst way
I wanna exhale like you should see
All I've been in
It's pretend that we make love
It's pretend that when I wake up
It's pretend this ain't the thought
Prentending I don't want it, I want it some more

[Chorus]
It's you
A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with
