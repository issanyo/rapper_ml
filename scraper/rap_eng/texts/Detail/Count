[Bridge]
Speed it up and get it back
Make it count where it at
Leave it up every time
Can you handle it? Can you handle it?

[Chorus]
Baby, don't make me
Count, count, count, count, count, count, count, count, count your money
Baby, don't make me
Count, count, count, count, count, count, count, count, count your money

[Verse 1]
Take me to your island, let me see the rain, waters, sun now
You sweating, put your gun down
If I call you Caesar you gotta be Caesar just one time
I'll please you if you spoil mine
Drink up, only drink up
All walking funny, the hell is in that cup?
Oh, I'm feeling bad the way we're waking up
A couple more glasses and you gon' get a pass at this

[Bridge] + [Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Dollars ain't nothin', bottles ain't nothin'
If you see something, push up all the buttons
Oh baby, go bigger, baby, keep it jumpin'
Pop a couple more and you'll get access to this lovin'
Oh baby, drink up, only drink up
Ooh, I got the feeling, oh, that's just your luck
Show me how you roll, I ain't looking for love
First I said ''be easy'', now I'm saying ''get rough''
Oh baby, spend it all

[Bridge] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't make me count that money
If you spending like you saying then lay it out in front of me, yeah
He gon' hustle 'til he die
Yeah, he just my type
G5 through the sky

[Chorus]
