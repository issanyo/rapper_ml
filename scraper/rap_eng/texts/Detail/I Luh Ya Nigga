[Refrain:]
I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you're all loving that, true

[Verse 1:]
Hold up, I can get you thrown up
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun up
Imma tie my hair up top
Put a pin in it, now I'm ready, let it rock
Keep it number 1, that's easy mathematics
Keep it number 1, baby, ain't no static
Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at these legs
No brakes, go green, no red
If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head
Put it on you, I'mma need about 4-5 beds
'Cause I love my nigga

[Pre-Chorus:]
I didn’t see it
But I see it now
I think I love you
And I need you now
Ain’t had none like you in a while

[Chorus:]
I luh ya nigga, I luh ya nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga
I luh ya nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga
I luh ya nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga
Yeah that my nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga

[Refrain:]
I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you're all loving that, true

[Verse 2:]
All day, 24 hour
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drop it how you want, I ain't trying to call Miley
I'm loving me some you
Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof
'Cause I love my nigga

[Pre-Chorus:]
I didn’t see it
But I see it now
I think I love you
And I need you now
Ain’t had none like you in a while

[Chorus:]
I luh ya nigga, I luh ya nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga
I luh ya nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga
I luh ya nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga
Yeah that my nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga

[Bridge:]
We haven’t grown apart
This is just the start where life begin, a way to the end
And we started as friends but boy I do love

[Chorus:]
I luh ya nigga, I luh ya nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga
I luh ya nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga
I luh ya nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga
Yeah that my nigga
I luh ya luh ya luh ya nigga
