[Intro: 2Pac]
Under pressure
Yeah, baby
When the pressure's on
Thug life
When it's on it's on

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
One of these days I'll, learn
Don't fuck with trick ass niggas
Cause they, turn
Into bitch ass niggas
I'm sick of being stuck in the county jail
My niggas clown, bring a pound when they're postin' bail
Smokin' blunts in the driveway
My 4-5 screamin', "fuck the police" won't fly away
Thug 'til I die, you wonder why I'm made this way
I wasn't turned out, I was raised this way
I'm thinkin' these, are the dreams of a young teen
Scheme, and stack green over crack fiends
One time can't hold me
One of these days, we gotta bust back for the homies
Locked down in the penitentiary
I'll finally lose my mind if the pigs succeed
I'm stressed, smokin' weed and nicotine
But what a nigga really need is Thorazine
Right before I die, I'll be cursin' the law
Reincarnated bitch, even worse than before
My 4-4's givin' payback
My underhanded plan to get them niggas while they laid back
And Big Stretch hit the scene with the mini 14
Servin' suckas like dope fiends and lead the whole team

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Under pressure, nigga
That's right

[Verse 2: Stretch]
Never run, throw your gun in the air, oh yeah
Nigga bust ain't no time to spare
Causin' ruckus mothafucker and we fuck shit up
And with the stainless steel razors, boy, we cut shit up
Flash and blast a nigga with the quickness
Cock the 4-pound motherfucker when I spit this and rip this
Damn, my mind is in the depths of hell
But when I'm walkin' on the street kid my name rings bells
And I never fell, nigga, I stand too tall
I'm just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl
Givin' my all, some niggas wanna bring it to me
So I'ma sell my cocaine, and lay their ass down, G

[Interlude: Stretch]
Under Pressure

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
(Yeah, look here though)
Runnin' wild, I never smiled as a juvenile
Even now, I keep a frown when I come around
Don't ask me about the past, it was all bad
Shots blasted, will I last in the wrong path?
In the dark is where my heart saw the most grief
Motherfuckas is gettin' shanked over gold teeth
Am I sick cause I'm addicted to get splifted?
Watchin' stupid ass tricks get lifted
Nothing's changed cause in the game it's a steady aim
Fuck friends, 'cause in the danger them niggas change
Puff weed and stuff G's in my sock, G
Car keys and Hennessy, where the Glock be?
Times passin', will I last here another day?
I put my gun away and grab my AK
It's gettin' hectic, I can't call it
House full of alcoholics
Now a nigga's under pressure

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Yeah, that's right
Under Pressure, we're niggas under pressure
Yeah

[Outro: 2Pac & Stretch]
When the pressure's on it's a hit
Ski mask, extra Gats, bring the clips
Don't nobody move when we walk the streets
They stay silent, cause talk is cheap
When the pressure's on it's a hit
Ski mask, extra Gats, bring the clips
Don't nobody move when we walk the streets
They stay silent, cause talk is cheap
When the pressure's on it's a hit
Ski mask, extra Gats, bring the clips
Don't nobody move when we walk the streets
They stay silent, cause talk is cheap
When the pressure's on it's a hit
Ski mask, extra Gats, bring the clips
Don't nobody move when we walk the streets
They stay silent, cause talk is cheap
When the pressure's on it's a hit
Ski mask, extra Gats, bring the clips
Don't nobody move when we walk the streets
They stay silent, cause talk is cheap
(You know) when the pressure's on it's a hit
Ski mask, extra Gats, bring the clips
Don't nobody move when we walk the streets
They stay silent, cause talk is cheap
(And you know), when the pressure's on it's a hit
Ski mask, extra Gats, bring the clips
Don't nobody move when we walk the streets

Don't nobody move when we walk the streets
