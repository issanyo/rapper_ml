[Intro sample]

[Verse 1: Warchief Avalon]
Let's escape to a place unexplored
Second star to the left
And straight on until morn
Mourn the loss of your ego
Your pride, and much more
You'll form a new sense of freedom
Vessel and soul being morphed
From a beady eyed demon, to a being of light
Beast in the night, to a deity, reason the lighting will smite
(I'm too nice) No need to shock the same spot twice
If I decide to descend a bolt, one strike will suffice
Summon the strength it takes to make it on your own
What if I told you, you can sell out shows but never sell your soul?
Seldom do I see 'em not doing what Simon told
So, Tribe wave goodbye, sayonara to your mold
We never fit in anyway (nah)
Fell on dark times, the sun always rises
Word to Ernest Hemingway
Nowadays, I'm doing more for my health
I'm eating well, just try to exercise and meditate
Well-o-well I wondered if Welbutrin would help
Not a chance in hell i'm gonna medicate
I gotta do this myself, I levitate (levitate), to a place
Where all my problems seem to float away (they float away)

[Verse 2: Buzzrd]
Hey
Green isn't your color
Victory smells sweet
But it isn't your cologne
And the throne isn't your seat. (so)
Get to stepping, and regretting all your first impressions
This world is wired for the wicked, with the worst intentions
("Yo, man I got this fire ass beat for you-")
Man please, I think it would be best for you to leave
See, this room ain't big enough for anybody but my team
We want the center of attention, satisfaction guaranteed
Main attraction, for a not so minimal fee
Tried to cut my legs off, but my dick made three
Now the advertisement reads "This dick ain't free."
From Figaro, to gigolo, on the same damn beat. (sheesh)
Well now the whole things got me walking funny
Talking money often when everything is an option for me
These hoes flocking as soon as you get it popping homie
But a lesson often forgotten is that the top is lonely
So, that's why we tend to stay cliqued up
A group of sick fucks, far too disgusting to discuss
Only after the big bucks, finger fucking the tip cups
Now reach for the sky like a stick up, it is The TRiBE

[Verse 3: Karyzmatik]
Feel like I've reached Christ consciousness
Slipped into the rift of time
I gaze upon the monolith
The image grips my oxygen
Ripping through a black hole
Eyes locked inside The Oculus
Intentions go out the back door
Once I start ingesting toxins
Its the gin and the chronic
I don't care what you talking
I might give up for some money
When i'm dead in the coffin. (dog look)
We never cared for your help
There's no sign of combatants
That's out here going after the belt
We coming for it homie
So you better watch for yourself
Said it's the hungriest pack of wolves
That never cared for your health
We like some titans in a cage match
I'm fighting till the death of me
Never lost in the sauce
But ya'll would sell out for the recipe
Been running through the jungle
Homie flowing through the evergreens
Just a boost in confidence
When a nigga see that bezzle gleam
Why trade what I was given?
Boy was born a rarity
No impurity in my system
You couldn't crack through the security
Its heresy to say the forces are in scarcity
For I am what they found at the point of singularity
(heresy to say the forces are in scarcity
For I am what they found at the point of singularity.)
