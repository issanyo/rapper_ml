I love you, you know that
We shopping, get cash back
My racks up, I spend that
I got skills, they gift wrapped

I’m sick with the flow man this ain’t difficult
We on tour you know we got posters and shows
And night after night we go all round the globe
We grindin so hard boy we fight and we fight

I’m nice but don’t push me, a sick MC boy you’ll see
I get it done just how it’s supposed to be
I put it down for those that’s close to me

I’m wicked, doin’ devils tricks they callin’ me da villain
I’m ridin, for my people there ain’t much time for chillin
Now look at us we in position
To change the game man forever winning

We makin it rain
We makin it rain it rain it rain
We makin it rain, we makin it rain, yeah (X2)

Two spades I’m all in, my cash up I’m ballin
You feel me you callin, I feel like I’m fallin
But I put up that front cuz I don’t want be hurt
But I’m strong enough to go hard for you cuz I still put you first

Baby I’m on my grind tryna overshine get my cake up and my weight up
At the end of the day I wanna make stacks cuz like Big Sean I stayed up
Now look at us we in position
To change the game man forever winning

We makin it rain
We makin it rain it rain it rain
We makin it rain, we makin it rain, yeah (X2)

Don’t fight with me when I call you
Don’t get mad at me it won’t fall through
Man I look at you in the eyes and your beauty paralyze me, your beauty paralyze me
I’m here boo, you know where to find me, we out here in the world I can see our stars is rising

Now look at us we in position
When two become one you can see my vision
I’ve seen some highs and lows now I ain’t too different
We fin to take this over man we on a mission
And I’ma give you all that good livin
To change the game man forever winning

We makin it rain
We makin it rain it rain it rain
We makin it rain, we makin it rain, yeah (X2)
