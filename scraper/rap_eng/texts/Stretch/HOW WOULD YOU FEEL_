[Verse 1]
How would you feel?
On some Xanz and a few pills
How would you feel?
Trying to get a hundred mill'
Like a hoop deal
Caught a case
But I just signed
A new deal
House arrest
Without a roof
Is how the coupe feel
I been livin' fast slow down mama told me
But that could never be the pace if you owed me

Been had it for a minute
Rick Owens on my body
All black rest in peace
I just came back from a trip
Trying to get it
Never stopped
Since I turned 17

[Hook]
How would you feel?
Sippin' Xanny lean
Jolly with a blue pill
Trying to tell 'em it ain’t me
Thats how the group feel
Had to leave 'em in they feelings
Nigga too real

How would you feel?
Niggas claiming
That I know them
Cause they bitch still
Still coming to my crib
With they leg spread
Can’t even count how many times
She on my bed spread

OH LORD

[Hook]
How would you feel?
Sipping Xanny lean
Jolly with a blue pill
Trying to tell 'em it ain’t me
Thats how the group feel
Had to leave 'em in they feelings
Nigga too real

[Verse 2]
Keep counting I’m scoring
81 points Kobe Bryant I'm pouring
Can’t fuck with fugazi
No faking the shit
If your not with affording
Them buckets keep dumping
Revolvers is pumping
They say halleluhhh
Got me some shooters
You know I don’t lie
Niggas ready to prove

Been had it for a minute
Rick Owens on my body
All black rest in peace
I just came back from a trip
Trying to get it
Never stopped
Since I turned 17

[Hook]
How would you feel?
Sippin' Xanny lean
Jolly with a blue pill
Trying to tell 'em it ain’t me
Thats how the group feel
Had to leave 'em in they feelings
Nigga too real

[Verse 3]
How would you feel?
Can’t count it on my hands a nigga fed up
Rather this than stressing how to get my rent up
All these haters worried how I got my bread up

OH NO

No need for pimping in parking lots
Seen niggas do it without a car
We just young niggas that talk a lot
Motivate bitches with catalogs
I want this I want that
Please zaddy can I have it
You ever cried in a trap
Have you squeezed on a strap
Put a life on your back
