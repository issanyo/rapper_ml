[verse 1: Napoleon Da Legend]

These politicians wanna kill us divid up the social class going to war poison our water got us going mad
No shelter for the homeless sleeping under the overpass the youth under the influence of drugs hard to get over that
Hospital bills medicaid recipient under Obamacare
When I hit the bottom wasn’t nobody but my mama there
These stars seem so far away no role models where live that rents late landlord screaming I gotta pay
Woke up late manager threatening to fire me
Police look at me like I’m a menace to society
Friend or foe it’s getting hard to tell apart
My homie's sister lost her child and she just feel apart
So much pain

[Hook]
Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain

[verse 2: Napoleon Da Legend]

They got me bugging feeling paranoid
Avoiding devils in the dark wearing a mask
And there’s void inside my heart
I feeling broken
Scattered pieces of my soul in city roaming
Johnny Walker to the head I hope it get me going
They fascinated by America overseas
While they try assassinate my character, enemies
I never mind em they blinded by jealousy
How the hell I make it out of hell free
A prisoner inside a cell block mentally
Shell shocked physically
If I fail I’m a liability
I need some dough by the week
I gotta hustle for my family to eat
I feel the pressure building up inside drunk and high
Somebody in my way and I’m pop em yo I swear to god
Yesterday I lost another brother
Looking up at the sky asking why we got to suffer
There’s much so pain

[Hook]
Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain
