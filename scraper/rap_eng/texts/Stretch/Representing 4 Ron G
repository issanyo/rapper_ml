[Intro: Stretch]
(Hahahaha)
Uh, Yeah
One time representin' for Ron G (Yeah)
You know what I'm sayin'? (That's right)
Thug Life in effect (baaby), 2Pac and Big Stretch

[Verse 1: Stretch]
Straight from the Terrordome
Where my niggas packin' chrome an extra clip when it's on
Never will I go left, I'm comes right, all night nigga
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype nigga
I punch 'em up, never gave a fuck, holdin' it down
Straight catch it for you goodies then I slides up town
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
This ain't a maze, we'll leave you niggas dead in a daze

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Follow me, tell me if you feel me, I think niggas is tryna kill me
Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points 'til they drill me
Keepin' it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin' steel
See niggas is false, sittin' in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they're petrified bitches
I'm tryna be strong, they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
Bitches be warned, word is bond you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Giuliani, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life, nigga we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at ya door with .44s

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Hahahahaha, yeah nigga
Thug Life, the waterbed, deadly combination boy
Get up outta here before you get your fuckin' head shot off
Or your ass peeled back, This how we do it out here on this underground
Real shit nigga
Watch out nigga this is '95, niggas barely stayin' alive
You know what I'm sayin' outta court, Fuck what you thought
Better stop thinkin' these niggas is fan
Ron G ain't no mother motherfuckin' joke
It's the heat nigga, now rewind this motherfucker, you know you can't help it

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
Keith Murray is comin' from the North Side, leavin' everything left as it's guessed
With every breath past proceed the word to death
This is a Keith Murray type of D-Day, so melee
Cause I got more skills than a sen-say
Searchin' for the bottom my flow, you're vanished
My style is still the flyest most transparent
On this motherfuckin' planet
I wish a nigga would try to take it for granted
I'm mad as fuck and my lifestyle is shady
So hey yo Big Lyte, best of three 80's
You see me, you see the L.O.D
Purposely psycho, so magically
M.V.P. of the M.I.C. Rap industry
And shit is still real, here put this shit up against your grill
Niggas know my style, niggas know I'm ill
Moet in the palm, flip then I stay real calm
For niggas tryna false alarm uh
Feel the steel in ya face as I raise the base
And the pace, in ya face
Punk ass bitches know what time it is with N.Y.C
Niggas go purely crazy
Bitch ass niggas get blasted, one, blah, catch it son
Motherfuckers know directly where I'm from
I'm dead serious from Long Island, represent the East Coast
Nigga you get burnt like toast
Cause I don't give a fuck, who don't give a fuck?
We don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck
So go buck buck buck buck
And duck like a chicken when I'm comin' through, bakin' you
Motherfuckers know my time and they know my name
And my crew, L.O.D, strictly whilin', for D
U.S.A., you see
Keith Murray, comin' through in the fly shit
Fuck around kid, you get your wig split
I don't have it, Ron G don't have it
Big Lyte don't have it, when you see it don't try to grab it
Cause it glitters and it's real gold
Fuck what you heard, and listen to what you been told

[Interlude: Keith Murray]
Yeah put that shit on hold
Once said piece to the L.O
Death squad
Waterbed
My boy 2Pac, you know what I'm sayin'?
Eric Skinner up in this beast
Niggas got slayed on the edge you know what I'm sayin'?
Eric Sermon and the death squad, y'all word up
New York in this motherfucker
East coast, west coast
From the north south to the

[Verse 4: It's Alive]
Hard times but hard rhymes
Then we picked up nines
And after that I had gotten into a life of crime
Gettin' mine stickin' laws killin' niggas in the mix
I couldn't give a fuck (It's Alive!) I was never turn to tricks
To stay up with my set game, bangin' when I have to
Never ever fail and always down to bust the caps too
At you, and that's how it went to pay the rent
And up in Cali motherfuckers know I'm gettin' paper
And now it's gettin' harder one times is on my tail
I Judge in New York cause I don't wanna go to jail
I'm lightin' up with my nigga Ron G
It's the Waterbed mad, nigga can't you see?
Nothing but the motherfuckin' bass in your face
No more crime I'm doin' rhyme, and gettin' mine up in the place
Bitches on my dick motherfucker can't survive
And nigga recognize motherfucker It's Alive!
