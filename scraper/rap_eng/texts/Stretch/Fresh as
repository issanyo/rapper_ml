[Verse 1: stretch]

Don't need assistance don't try assist this
Resistance isn't consistent dude just admit it
Grab a ticket I'm breaking limits like Bradly Cooper is
Truth is I'm ruthless revolution brewing like tea
Soon to be a household name spitting out flames
Verses with'a purpose hip-hop's drowning I'm the surface
Battling me, I wouldn't risk it I'm a monster out the ninth district
Statistics script that most with dig this like shovels
Chuckles be my partner in crime won't see him for quite some time
No questions I'm the best shit's often requested
I'm amazing flow complex as a maze man
Expect amazement and face it like a mirror
Clearer words never been spoken
Just hoping that labels be scoping like snipers
Cause I make other emcees look shitty like diapers
Clever mind sever spins in seven lines or less
Impress the rest express what I possess
Infamous sick as syphilis is sucker punch
What's for lunch? prolly microphones
Chromosomes laced with trichomes by the eighth
Beautiful mind Russell Crowe we all know I flow
Like h 2 the O death from above look out below
It's evident by this evidence I'm excellent
I excel in sense with intense sentences
Right hook uppercut leaves ya somewhat thunderstruck
It's true
I went mental on this instrumental, thanks Chad n' Pharrell
Just spit an ocean guess it's time for me to set sail
