[Intro skit]

[Verse 1: Buzzrd]
Saved by the clock on the wall on a Friday
Just got paid 85 on the highway
Headed from the spot where I cop my crops
I haven't seen a single cop
So I hot my box and drop my top
Now like me the roof is gone
Smoke, billowing out of it and poof i'm gone
A silhouette in the sun, a cigarette to the lungs
Looking forward to the second to none
Legend I've yet to become
I beat my own drum
March at my own pace
Still play all of my old songs, reminiscing the old days
Pen on the pad, on my Levi lap
Yeah dem, five-elevens from the clearance rack
I mean, just contrast from when my Nissan crashed to now
It's kind of funny how we keep on track, to beat our ops
Be on top and feast on tracks, like rib racks
Tie up the bibs, we're bought to eat off rap
It's nothing but

[Chorus: Buzzrd]
Oh, it's just another day in the life
High as hands at the shows we'll be playing tonight
It's just another day in the life
Get ya motherfucking, get ya, get ya hands up

[Verse 2: Warchief]
Said I just stepped off the stoop, on a Sunday afternoon
I get a whiff of my top lip (sniff)
It smell like pussy juice. (oooo)
Uber home from this bitty's house
She let me smoke her stash, and hit the ass
Now I'm dipping out
Little succubus, tried to suck my soul
So i had to heave-n-ho this thieving hoe, but not befo'
I hit the deep G, like a motherfucking sousaphone
Stroke slow, like the pull on the stoge, or my flow
Momma told me never trust a bitch
At least as far as you can throw her
Gotta know I like 'em thick
So I never let 'em in unless I'm dicking 'em down
Distant, but intimate they keep coming around
(Pun intended)
Punish my intentions for these women
For they're wicked lord
For awhile one kept me down
Picked my head up
Planted ten toes to the ground
Howling to the wind "Please feet don't fail me now!"
Lost love and to my luck, gained some room to grow
So I stayed locked inside my home,for many moons writing songs
Focused on nothing but shows, and it shows
In the performance of a lifetime, every time that we go
You know

[Chorus: Buzzrd, Warchief Avalon]
Oh, it's just another day in the life
High as hands at the show we'll be playing tonight. (yeah)
It's just another day in the life
(High as hands at the show we'll be playing tonight.)
Get ya motherfucking, get ya, get ya hands up

[Verse 3: Karyzmatik]
It's just another day in the life
Crack a shell, high as hell, where we playing tonight?
Shit, half that shit is old news, we still kick it old school
Nigga still looking for that spot, that we can roll through
Homie, past the Sprite, keep it clean, I get my drink on
Blowing on that sour, making out would take a week long
I'm fresh up out the shower, hit the pussy, then it's work time
Feel like a nigga come a long way from that Neon
Master Cards and Visas, got it all from the seance
We paint the Mona Lisa when i'm doodling with Crayons
(Look) So all-n-all you couldn't touch me
This that Saturday morning, ridding 'round on my Huffy
Homie hit the store for some Hot Cheetos and a Slushy
Back in them days, that I be out here bumming for some money
Now I, keep the dub sack and twenty dollars in my pocket
Said I got it on lock, like her pussy when she pop it
Looks like young blood turned Nostradamus from a novice
So it's never small talk, when you talking to the prophets. (aye)
So let me count up all my profits, and smoke a little chronic
Leave the problems for tomorrow. (it's a)

[Chorus: Buzzrd, Karyzmatik]
Oh, it's just another day in the life
High as hands at the shows we'll be playing tonight
(Where we playing?)
It's just another day in the life
Get ya motherfucking, get ya motherfucking hands up
