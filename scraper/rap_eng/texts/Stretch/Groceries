Alright
Real Nigga Record
You are listening to a real nigga record

[Hook]
I'm Getting high and smoking dope
Rolling up medicinal
All my grams nutritional
Got green like a grocery store
Always on the fucking go
Headed to the fucking dope
No strings attached
So she don't get too emotional [x2]

[Verse 1]
I'm getting head and smoking dope
Ash that shit and count my dough
I've been getting bands you can ask my damn accountant hoe
Shining like a star
I can't fuck round with you (?) hoes
Be that actress bitch somewhere acting in the movie roles
Dope boy I don't rock them baggy clothes
Or them skinny clothes
Or them pants with holes
Niggas run from beef, I be confronting foes
Going toe to toe bitch you wanna go
Big ole titty bitch she like to ride
Me while I motorboat
Rockstar life we all off them drugs hope we don't overdose
Kick us out of the smoking section cause we over smoke
Check that girls identification don't need young ass hoes
Said her parents went on vacation
Bad girl changing clothes

[Hook]
