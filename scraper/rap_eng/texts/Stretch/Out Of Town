Verse 1:
My shawty she call me fallback I’ve been busy I’ve been back and then forth from the city

Ever since young I been dealing it out Fuck is you bout
Don’t take any losses So figure it out
Cause everything gorgeous

They trying they best to look past
And ignore this
But fuck em

Then I hit up my jeweler like wrap up my Rolex Cause I use to sleep on the floor
Before we had bitches galore
Before we had plans for the tour

You know I’m rollin Rollin
