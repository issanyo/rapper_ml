[hook: x2]

Poured some lean into my cup
And took the smoke straight to my head
Overdosin' on the gas that i inhaled
I'm off the shits
High pursuit in my accord
I'm blasting off can't see the Feds
Bitch i'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone
Can't feel my fuckin' face

Poured some vodka in my cup
And took the smoke straight to my head
Overdosin' on the xans that i just bought
I'm off the shits
High pursuit in my accord
I'm blasting off can't see the Feds
Bitch i'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone
I cannot feel a thing

[Verse]

Bitch I'm switching up the rhythm
For the people that be talking
If I'm walking get the fuck up out the store
Hella fuckin bitches
On my dicky
Giving hickies
Sticky lickin'
I can give a motherfuck about a hoe
It's the cold coat, hoe smokin dope
And suck on my dick type bitch
Wrist on wrist
Say she love my clique
Got groupie hoes on my dick
Little model hoes that I find on twitter
Promised all my bros
Cuz I'm sure that imma get her
Every time I drop the heat
The draws drop to the feet
And the money in my socks gettin' bigger
I told you I'd do it
If i ever said I'll do it
Pussies Must think that I'm stupid
Why you be hatin' ?
Cuz I be off of the xans
And I'm makin' more money than you is?
I don't even know
Why you even think that I see you all as competition
Y'all Cannot compete with me
I'll drop you easily
Fuck you, I'm tired of your repetition
You think that you live ?
Never mind
You live
Just keep on wasting all your time
I know why you hot
I'm takin' yo fans
And you acting like everything's perfectly fine
Come up and diss me
Yo bitch wanna kiss me
Cuz yo music trash
And mine get her all kinky
She listen my songs and she be getting wet
Hitting my phone to come over and hit
Told her I'd go
If she gimme the dome
Let me record to keep it on my phone
Post it on snap cuz im flexin' like post
And these women don't care if they treated like hoes

[verse 2:]

Yeah I promised Marshall that I'm snapping
At anyone who comes at me or my actions
I been with the shits, straight off the rip
I got chains in my veins
And a Dutch On my lips
And they turn on me quick
Watch how I'll get
You wear bape
I rock vans and I still fuck yo bitch
I don't care if they switch
My brothers hit licks
We still broke on the low
But the dudes getting rich
Fuck a thot
What she thought that we moving this?
Nah, I got furious 7 like ludacris now
Let the show go on now, we got numerous crowds
We the best at the venue but no ones around
Fuck what they talkin'
My shoes got some holes in em
Pants kinda tight, but I'm coppin' a rolly
Slam em while I choke em
I take em from under
Fuck cells, I'll drop hell on them like Its mick foley, bitch
