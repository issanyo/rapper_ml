[Intro: 2Pac]
("You can dance underwater and not get wet, aww")
Shit don't stop
("You can dance underwater and not get wet, Aww")
Shit don't stop

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Game rules often slang to them lame fools
Heavy hittin' at this motherfucker's straight spittin'
Diggin' deep into your brain
While tryin' to explain why real niggas need to stick to the game
It's the shame got these motherfuckers changin' on me
Jealous-ass player-haters gamin' on me
Look out motherfucker, I'm a G
As in gettin' motherfuckers 'fore they come get me
Gettin' mad for the right for the wishes
Fake ass nigga, you in trip (why?), for fightin' over bitches
We call that a player hater, straight sissy
See me at my show nigga miss me
Cause I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit
Got a pistol motherfucker better pull quick
And just cause I'm rappin', it don't mean I ain't scrappin'
And if you clip when the shit happens
It don't stop

[Chorus: Y.N.V. & 2Pac]
Now my guess is true
Shit don't stop
Them thug life niggas is a bull
(man), It don't stop
Everywhere we go
Shit don't stop
The niggas trippin' at the door
It don't stop
I want to dance with you
I can dance underwater and not get wet
("You can dance underwater and not get wet, Aww")

[Verse 2: Macadoshis &  Rated R]
See the shit don't stop, my 9 goes pop
Your body drip-drop, throw that ass in a zip-loc
Now you get a hauled away in a body bag
Get your Sammy D said how your blood got sneeze me
Yo, you fuckin' with a thug, yo your ass gets plugged
With this hollow-point slugs with ya under the rug
That's why my deaf niggas don't play that shit
And thug life niggas be the craziest
So when you think about fuckin' this, you better wear a vest
But it really don't matter, we ain't aimin' at your chest
Nah we blowin' holes in your motherfuckin' skull
Make sure your ass is smoked, that's all the fat lady wrote
You heard that fat bitch sing when my shit went bang-bang
But it don't pay when I flaunt your brain
Nigga, ain't no plain cane brothers come no show in the casket
Git'n they ass kicked and blasted
It don't stop

[Chorus: Y.N.V. & Rated R]
Now my guess is true
Shit don't stop
Them thug life niggas is a bull
It don't stop
Everywhere we go
The shit don't stop
The niggas trippin' at the door
It don't stop
I want to dance with you
Shit don't stop
I can dance underwater and not get wet
("You can dance underwater and not get wet, Aww")

[Verse 3: Mopreme & Big Syke]
All I wanna do is try to Mac the hoes
Spend bank on things sellin' me a sponsor on my foes
It's like each and every one they got the look of death
I got my 9 nigga, don't be silly, watch your step
And proceed with caution when my crew is flossin'
Bitches we tossin', and niggas we crossin'
It's like a murder mob when we hit yo' hood
It's all good, the punks, I wished you would
Wouldn't better to just correlate what we bust
Instead of kickin' dust gets a press y'all from nuts
Cause ain't no herbs here and ain't no marks
Beware of the water cause they full of sharks
But in every state, niggas perpetrate and test
Where I come from fools die for less
And thugs keep thuggin' 'til their casket drop
It's on 'til I die and the shit don't stop

[Chorus: Y.N.V. w/  Mopreme & Big Syke]
Now my guess is true
Shit don't stop
Them thug life niggas is a bull
It don't stop
Everywhere we go
The shit don't stop
The niggas trippin' at the door
It don't stop
I want to dance with you
Shit don't stop
I can dance underwater and not get wet
("You can dance underwater and not get wet, Aww")
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
("You can dance underwater and not get wet, Aww")
