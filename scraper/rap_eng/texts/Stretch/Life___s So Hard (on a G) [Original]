[Intro]
Young Playa
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
(This one right here is for)
Heyy
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
(Kato, Mental)
Heyy
(To all the dead niggas that passed away)
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
(I told ya I wouldn't forget about you)
Heyy
(Do a verse for 'em)
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder

[Hook]
Tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G

[Verse 1]
Travel through my mind, am I blind it's a shame
Young brothas gettin murdered, straight took out the game
As I sit here puffin' on a cigarette
You gotta be ready, you never know who's plottin' on a niggas death
'Cause these are the rough times, best to hurry up
And duck motherfucker 'fore I buck mine
It's gettin' crazy and everybody's strapped
Surrounded by niggas but nary motherfucker down to watch your back
These are the bitch made niggas, you been played nigga
While you starvin' and broke they pullin' six figures
Oooh, what can you do
When you can't trust your crew, time to bust out the twenty-two
Boo-yaow!
Ran out of weed, so I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
Tell me, do you feel me?
Heyyy, I have no remorse
As I take another sip of my liquor, I spit my sick thoughts, hehehe

[Hook]
Tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Thuggin' to the fullest, got my strap, I'ma pull it
On the first motherfucker that can outrun a bullet
It's them Thug Life niggas, and we don't like tricks
Got these punk wannabes and they jockin' like bitches
Now my riches is gettin' hoes on its own
Fuck a mystery, do you wanna get with me, then let's bone
Time to take her to my hideout, 'cause I'm smokin' that spinach
I'm stayin' strong to the finish and then I ride out
See you on the freeway, sorry baby
But I gotta call my homey see what he say
I ain't got no time, I gotta get mine
I keep my mind on my loot, I'll shoot everytime
And ain't no way I'ma let bitch made nigga worry me
Catch me slippin', empty the clip and bury me
Hell nah, homie, have to plug me twice
'Cause ain't no stoppin when you Thug for Life...

[Hook]
Now tell me do you see, tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
(It's hard on a nigga)
Tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
(It's hard on a nigga)

[Verse 3]
Never bow down, let these other bitches crawl
I'm a Thug motherfucker, and thugs only ball
Ain't no half steppin' here, from the cradle to the grave
I'm a motherfuckin' fool, but I choose to get paid
Now my pockets gettin' empty, so I'm panicked in a fright
Me and my bitch named Nina are fiendin' tonight
Ain't nobody livin' safe, got a Glock, and I'm stressin'
All I want is my money, motherfucker ain't no question
Don't try to stall, 'cause I'm hit
So bring me the scissors and get to clippin' at his dick
I'd rather die young than die old and broke
That's why I stay drunk, and I constantly smoke
My memories as a youngsta, hangin' with the homies
But now I'm doin' bad and them bitches don't know me
But playa haters can't fade me
'Cause this is thug life nigga and we're crazy, tell me do you see?
