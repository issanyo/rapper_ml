[Chorus]
Lately I been glowing, yeah
No tellin' where I'm going, yeah
Disconnected from 'em, brought some new connections
Pullin' up in foreign, yeah
Pockets lookin' gorgeous, yeah
Once she hit my DM, I don't feel the message
Lately I been glowing, yeah
No tellin' where I'm going, yeah
Disconnected from 'em, brought some new connections
Pullin' up in foreign, yeah
Pockets lookin' gorgeous, yeah
Everyday I wake up, I don't lose no blessings

[Verse 1]
Now they see me in a different sport
I remember breaking keys to open doors
Same keys that had a nigga trapped in court
Same keys that pay for lawyers, praise the lord
Got my business straight
Dropped that hoe elimidate
I'ma get my new ones some new diamonds, look like lemonade
When she hold me down when I'm around I love my enemies
I had to hold it down when I'm in town, we built that chemistry
Yeah, shawty mean
You know how I like to celebrate
Following my lead she talking shit, while she give me cake
Oh, I'm not around, I had a curve, go get your feelings straight
No, I'm not around for all the drama that you generate, yeah

[Chorus]
Lately I been glowing, yeah
No tellin' where I'm going, yeah
Disconnected from 'em, brought some new connections
Pullin' up in foreign, yeah
Pockets lookin' gorgeous, yeah
Once she hit my DM, I don't feel the message
Lately I been glowing, yeah
No tellin' where I'm going, yeah
Disconnected from 'em, brought some new connections
Pullin' up in foreign, yeah
Pockets lookin' gorgeous, yeah
Everyday I wake up, I don't lose no blessings

[Verse 2]
She didn't want a nigga catchin' fame
Now these different cities know my name
Rather see me broke, I can explain
Told my jeweler add more links all on my chain
Watch my chain glow
Diamonds shine like rainbow
I just got a new bitch
No shinin' with the same hoe
Fuck you think I came for
I don't play no games, hoe
Everytime she see me I be shittin', it's so painful
Gotta 'member nobody was raised how you was raised, tho
When you comin' up they come around they get they plates full
Lamborghini swerve, and it sounds so disgraceful
Let me take a moment, Cash is callin', what you sayin' bro?

[Chorus]
Lately I been glowing, yeah
No tellin' where I'm going, yeah
Disconnected from 'em, brought some new connections
Pullin' up in foreign, yeah
Pockets lookin' gorgeous, yeah
Once she hit my DM, I don't feel the message
Lately I been glowing, yeah
No tellin' where I'm going, yeah
Disconnected from 'em, brought some new connections
Pullin' up in foreign, yeah
Pockets lookin' gorgeous, yeah
Everyday I wake up, I don't lose no blessings
