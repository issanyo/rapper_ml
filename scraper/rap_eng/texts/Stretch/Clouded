I gotta know right now
Girl is you 'bout it
‘cuz I just smoked some kush and I feel clouded
So come to my way
We can spark up
I got something to say
I got something to place
Me and you baby and
We can stay lazy
Just gone off the haze
Maybe it’s a phase

But I got some pre rolls in my car
We can go so far
And forget about tomorrow, but
If you trying to be just like the rest
Then you know is right onto the next, so I

I gotta know right now
Girl is you 'bout it
‘cuz I smoked way too much and I feel clouded
I rolled up and blurred right in my fucking car
Vroom vroom skr skr bitch I’m going far
And I
I’m high and i’m gone
I’m bout to rip the bong now
And yeah, that’s what I said
So come girl and just hop up in my bed

I gotta know right now
Girl is you with it
I know you want that kush can you feel claim it
But say what you feel, it is just me and you and
We don’t keep it real yeah we don’t keep it true
Cuz if we do that then we can’t get right back to our stream
[?]
That's just how I feel
But I got some pre rolls in my car
We can go so far
And forget about tomorrow, but
If you trying to be just like the rest
Then you know is right onto the next, so I

I gotta know right now
Girl is you 'bout it
‘cuz I smoked way too much and I feel clouded
I rolled up and blurred right in my fucking car
Vroom vroom skr skr bitch I’m going far
And I
I’m high and i’m gone
I’m bout to rip the bong now
And yeah, that’s what I said
So come girl and just hop up in my bed
