[Intro: 2Pac]
Yeah nigga, drop the top on your motherfuckin' ride
This how we do it on the West Coast, baby

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Rollin' down the 405
Gettin' high, white boys done wrecked their shit
To check my ride
I ain't bein' bootsy
Crusin' in a six-o Impala, drivin' like I'm in a hooptee
A Car full of ballin' cats
Keep yo hand on the strap and take all the craps
Niggas know my steelo
All legit, but I'm draped like a nigga movin' kilos
Shit don't stop cause I can make that ass drop
Make the front hop
And hit the three-wheel-motion, all day hit the freeway
Take it easy, uh
Let's slide and pick up some hoochies
Ride, right back to the movies
High, talkin' back to the screen, drinkin' liquor
Havin' big dreams of gettin' richer
I'm livin' that ...

[Hook: 2Pac, (Mopreme & Stretch)]
Thug life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do what 'cha gotta do (Stay true!)
Yeah, thug life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do what 'cha gotta do (Stay true!)
Uh, thug life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do what 'cha gotta do (Stay true!)
Yeah, thug life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do what 'cha gotta do (Stay true!)

[Verse 2: 2Pac & Stretch]
Big Stretch represent the real nigga
Flex, Live Squad and this motherfucker catch wreck
Thug Life
Sharp as a rough knife
Shakin' the dice, we roll on dough with nothin' nice
So the Vice wanna follow us around - Raise up
Got 'em runnin' as we clown through the town - Blaze up
Another one, had to throw another gun
Don't need another case
You can see it on my face, son
But I ain't fallin' yet
And I gotta give a shout to my ballers at
Mopreme, tell 'em why the hoes dream
Gettin' high of a nigga like a dope fiend

[Verse 3: Mopreme]
Cause I'm non-stop and I'm always hustlin'
24/7, ain't nothin' proper
When a, young G's flippin' keys for a livin'
Try to make a mill of the time that I'm givin'
Trippin'
Mad
I'm crazy
Can't nobody fade me
And I been goin' insane lately
And everybody tryna hold me back
I'm 'bout to snap
You better move back
You know I led a ...

[Hook: 2Pac, (Mopreme & Stretch)]
Thug life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do what 'cha gotta do (Stay true!)
Thug life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do what 'cha gotta do (Stay true!)
Uhm, thug life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do what 'cha gotta do (Stay true!)
Thug life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do what 'cha gotta do (Stay true!)

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Man!!, I don't worry about the five-O
If they start cause it's all about survival
Just stay smart, keep your mind on your bank roll
Always stay ahead of these stank hoes
These days it's an all out cat race, and look at me
Just caught another catch case, that makes three
My lawyers gettin' cash, off that ass, don't even ask
Why I'm buck wild, don't smile, don't laugh
To the young G's comin' up; Peep game
Don't let the money make you change or act strange
Stay focused, all in together now
Keep pumpin' loud pull the crowd put my top down
Is that 2Pac, Thug Life? Hell yeah
Tryna dirty up my name but I'm still here
Which way do I turn? I'm strapped
Lost in the storm I can't turn back with that ...

Gotta do what 'cha gotta do (Stay true!)
Thug life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do what 'cha gotta do (Stay true!)
Thug life, y'all know the rules
Gotta do what 'cha gotta do (Stay true!)
