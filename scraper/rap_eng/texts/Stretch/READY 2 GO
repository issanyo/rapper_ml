[Hook]
No I don’t ever decline (Ready to go)
See her, I take her, she mine (Ready to go)
No one ain’t wasting my time (Ready to go)
Swear I ain’t waiting in line (Ready to go)
Yah!
Ready to go, ready to go (Yah)
Ready to go, ready to go (Yah)
Ready to go, ready to go (Yah)
Ready to go, ready to go (Yah)

[Verse 1]
Promise I’m making a path for my niggas that’s holding me down
Know me some niggas that’s lost in the sauce ain’t gonna never get found
No I don’t keep me no serpents rollin’ around in my crew
Nah I ain’t into no gossip something real niggas don’t do
I ain’t gonna squash any beef that you know that you started with them
Say you a man, be a man and boss up and just handle your bread
Niggas get caught up and first thing they go do is go talk to the feds
Stay that informant ass quiet, got shooters that’s wanting your head

[Hook]
No I don’t ever decline (Ready to go)
See her, I take her, she mine (Ready to go)
No one ain’t wasting my time (Ready to go)
Swear I ain’t waiting in line (Ready to go)
Yah!
Ready to go, ready to go (Yah)
Ready to go, ready to go (Yah)
Ready to go, ready to go (Yah)
Ready to go, ready to go (Jeez)

[Verse 2]
I don’t do loving that shit a mistake (Shit a mistake)
I been fucking with her while I fuck Mary Kate (Fuck Mary Kate)
Both bitches is white like the brick in my safe (Brick in my safe)
They cut up the coke on they mom dinner plate
Ready to go, blingin’ my cellular phone
I got locations to drop off the work
And I’m making a killing alone (Killing alone)
Still in the home
Momma been paying ya phone
Hating on me, I could put you on feet but instead I’mma shit a lil’ more

[Hook]
No I don’t ever decline (Ready to go)
See her, I take her, she mine (Ready to go)
No one ain’t wasting my time (Ready to go)
Swear I ain’t waiting in line (Ready to go)
Yah!
Ready to go, ready to go (Yah)
Ready to go, ready to go (Yah)
Ready to go, ready to go (Yah)
Ready to go, ready to go
