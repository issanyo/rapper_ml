[Intro: Sarah Barthel]
Flew too high
Fell in the Sun

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
I'm just a cool ass nigga, put Atlanta on the map
I whip the yellow Cadillac, I like my seats way back
I bust the sun roof open, beams hit the Braves cap
Call me Chief Noc-A-Homa, you can't beat it with a bat
Droppin' bombs, atomic, dog I could never chase the cat
Keep the spotlight on me, it will never fade to black
If I speak it then I mean it, I will never take it back
My demeanor's like a king, I'm leavin' niggas in the trap

[Chorus: Sarah Barthel]
Melting the ice
We fell in the Sun, love
Ain't no surprise
We fell in the, we fell in the, we fell in the Sun, love

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Once upon a time there was a boy named Daddy Fat
Heard he grew into a man and put his family on his back
Had a master plan, Da Vinci code, nobody couldn't crack
Even though when times got difficult, he kept on slangin' rap
Servin' nothin' but that gas cause the walls are full of plaques
And not the regular unleaded or the mid, we got the pack
We extra-terrestrial, extraordinary
In the center of your solar system, shinin' on the daily

[Chorus: Sarah Barthel]
Melting the ice
We fell in the Sun, love
Ain't no surprise
We fell in the, we fell in the, we fell in the Sun, love

[Bridge: Sarah Barthel]
Shine like a second at the Sun, but it's too hot
Don't matter where you're from, lose your cool now
Dealt this dope from ATL to New York
Dealt this dope from ATL to New York
Shine like a second at the Sun, but it's too hot
Don't matter where you're from, lose your cool now
Dealt this dope from ATL to New York
Dealt this dope from ATL to New York

[Interlude: Big Boi]
Oh yeah
Talk about a Vitamin D overdose
And I do mean D

[Chorus: Sarah Barthel]
Melting the ice
We fell in the Sun, love
Ain't no surprise
We fell in the, we fell in the, we fell in the Sun, love
We fell in the, we fell in the Sun
We fell in the, we fell in the, we fell in the Sun, love
We fell in the, we fell in the Sun
We fell in the, we fell in the Sun, love
