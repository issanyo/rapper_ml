[Intro: Big Rube & CeeLo Green]
If we don't stand up, we fall down
Without exception, this matter reaches terminal velocity
We the ones who fight
So I speak for reception of this philosophy
Fight, test your might

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
We the ones who fight
We the ones who fight

[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
Stand up to oppression
Stand up to all aggression
Stand up, it's time to choose
So your children will never lose (Woo!)
Stand up, you know it's right
Stand up with all your might
'Cause you know that...

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
We the ones who fight
All I know is to keep on going
Just pretend to carry on, carry on
We the ones who fight
All I know is to keep on going
Just pretend to carry on, carry on
We the ones who fight
All I know is to keep on going
Just pretend to carry on, carry on
Well, well

[Verse 2: Sleepy Brown]
Stand up to money preaching
Stand up to bad policing
Stand up, the time is over
We are together and we are one
Stand up, you know it's right
Stand up with all your might
'Cause you know that...

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
We the ones who fight
All I know is to keep on going
Just pretend to carry on, carry on
We the ones who fight
All I know is to keep on going
Just pretend to carry on, carry on
We the ones who fight
All I know is to keep on going
Just pretend to carry on, carry on
Well, well

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Elevated thinkin', higher learnin'
And always talkin' 'bout this cookie that I'm burnin'
My sermon is for the children
And for the mamas and the daddy's that ain't earnin'
Now see the incense burnin'
But that's just superficial on the surface
The people open arms 'cause they killin' us on purpose
And now they pray for calm 'cause American is nervous
Ya heard me? Thank you for your service (NAGGA!)
From a family of military vets
My granddaddy and daddy, they were military, yes
God, God blessed the dead
Protect the livin' and give us the spirit they keep on killin' 'cause...

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
We the ones who fight
All I know is to keep on going
Just pretend to carry on, carry on
We the ones who fight
All I know is ti keep on going

[Outro: Big Rube]
His fights that are cuffed tight
No longer enough for this fight between darkness and light
We must test our true might
No time for the ones who might
Only the strongest will, that will desire to instill righteous fire
In those they've sired who fight
This a new flight plan
Applied in course of truth, not fiction
No longer is the focus irrelevant friction
Between the yellow, the red, the black and white man
We seek the true source
Speak with a new voice
Time's up
Can no longer afford the expense of giving you choice
We now demand compliance
Can't withstand defiance
Clear your soul and mind of pseudo science
And archaic premises
There's no right defense, you either with me or nemesis

We the ones who fight
