[Verse 1]
You know I been out here doing me
Like I said I would
Every night I lay with two or three
Got me feeling good

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't want it to be over when you told me it was over
Baby, now I'm getting under somebody
All I wanted was to know love, now these hoes ain't getting no love
I'm just sitting tryna pour up and party

[Chorus]
Baby, you made me this way
I got you to thank, I got you to thank
Baby, you made me this way
I got you to thank 'cause I'm not the same, no
Uh huh, baby, uh huh, yeah, yeah
You made me this way, no
Uh huh, baby, uh huh, yeah, yeah
You make me this way

[Verse 2]
This ain't what I thought I wanted, babe (oh, woah)
Until you were gone, yeah (until you were gone)
I'd be crazy to ever complain (yeah, don't, baby)
'Cause I don't sleep alone, baby ('cause I don't sleep alone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, didn't want it to be over when you told me it was over (didn't want it to be, when you told me it was)
Baby, now I'm getting under somebody (baby, now I'm getting, yeah, somebody)
All I wanted was to know love, now these hoes ain't getting no love (know love, no love)
I'm just sitting tryna pour up and party (pour up and party)

[Chorus]
Baby, you made me this way (I got you)
I got you to thank, I got you to thank (huh, you)
Baby, you made me this way (baby, you made me this way)
I got you to thank 'cause I'm not the same, no (same)
Uh huh, baby, uh huh, yeah, yeah
You made me this way, no (girl, no)
Uh huh, baby, uh huh, yeah, yeah (uh huh, baby, uh huh)
Baby, you make me this way (you make me this way)

[Verse 3]
Pull up, pull up here with dutty shottas
You whine, you whine, it don't really matter
