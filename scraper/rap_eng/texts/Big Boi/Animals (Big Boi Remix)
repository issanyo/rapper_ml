[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
So what you trying to do to me?
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
So if I run, it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Don't tell no lies, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
I am one of a kind like a white lion
Drop down fangs in the night time
We can do things until the sun rises
She got that sunshine, I'm talkin' 'bout good good
And when she expose her super moon
I'ma give her that good wood
Astronaut, plant a pole with a flag on it
Best she ever had and clearly all she ever wanted, homie
#YouCouldNeverBeThis
Another #StevieWonderYouWillNeverSeeThisEither
I run my fingers over that cleavage like I'm reading braille
She's the leading lady in every one of my freaky tales
Loyale and royale, she earned her crown and throne
Ride or die to the fullest, a house is not a home when she's gone

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...
