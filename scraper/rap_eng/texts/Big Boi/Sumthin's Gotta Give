It's funny right? They say things done change
No more messages in the music, record sales down, gas prices up
No more love in your love, no more love for your love
Change is long overdue, Mary, something's gotta give, Big Boi

You can trot around the planet or watch it on the news
Sombody's getting shot, the weather man's looking confused
He's reporting to a nation full of zombies strung out on starbucks
And stitched up and bitching Abercrombie

Uh, don't get it mixed up me too
I have insomnia at times but don't be walkin' 'round here blind
Nigga feelin' all around, trying to find a righteous path
It's appealin' when I rhyme

So everytime I hit the masses, you know the common folk
Blue collared day to day workers
That squeeze a dollar so they baby can swallow
A little not a lota just enough to fill that bottle

But it's a million dollars a gallon for some gas to get to work
Tomorrow that's if you gotta get it, you can't swim in carpool
You Rob Peter to pay Paul to make due
Make you wanna write a note and take a pistol to that bank too
And pass it to the teller but you know better

They trying to tell us to stay strong
But every day we losing jobs
From College Park out to Beverly Hills
Somethin's gonna have to give

Across the world they live in fear
But it's the same thing over here
If you can hear me on Capitol Hill
Somethin's gonna have to give

The great debators debate about who's the greatest MC
Subject matter don't matter because the verse is empty
No food for thought nothing for the brain to digest
So I guess it'd be about who can bullshit the best

But I give them light on like the traffic I direct
Inspiring their life like they was actors on my set
As if I was a pilot, take 'em higher than a jet
I'd be a liar if I wasn't sick and tired of this mess

They trying to tell us to stay strong
But every day we losing jobs
(Everyday, everyday)
From College Park out to Beverly Hills
Somethin's gonna have to give
(Give it up y'all)

Across the world they live in fear
But it's the same thing over here
(Over here, yeah)
If you can hear me on Capitol Hill
Somethin's gonna have to give
(Oh, yeah)

Single mother in a struggle and it's no fun
But you don't really understand until you are one
A child is sick and is losing his endurance
She want to fix him but she 'ain't got no insurance

Now we don't even want to talk about the man's life
Out on parol with the promise that he'll do right
But a felon has no chance for a new start
So it's back to doing hand in hand on his own block

And blacks and whites, we're all the same and I know you feel my pain
And the only hope I have to help me deal with the drama
Is that maybe in November I'll be cheering for Obama

They trying to tell us to stay strong
(Yeah)
But everyday we losing jobs
(Every day)
From College Park out to Beverly Hills
(Ooh)
Somethin's gonna have to give
(Give it up, give it up)

Across the world they live in fear
But it's the same thing over here
(Over here)
If you can hear me on Capitol Hill
(Listen to me now)
Something's gonna have to give
(Give it up y'all)

The world is too big
Free your mind or be stuck like porcupine left behind
That's the bottom line, gotta find the grind
'Cause the time won't be coming back around, get it now nigga

The world is too big
Step on the stars while you're reaching for the sun
But never burn a bridge, each one, teach one
If you lend a helping hand, you may never be one

The world is too big
And I heard him say that every man, woman
And child was gonna be okay
I heard him say that they would bring
Our soldiers home in one piece today

The world is too big
But it's not that way
They've been selling us a dream
Telling us we on the same team
Now we all gotta deal with the lies

They trying to tell us to stay strong
(Yeah)
But everyday we losing jobs
(Every day)
From College Park out to Beverly Hills
Somethin's gonna have to give
(Have to give)

Across the world they live in fear
(Oh yeah)
But it's the same thing over here
(Over here)
If you can hear me on Capitol Hill
(I know you hear me)
Somethin's gonna have to give
(Yeah)
