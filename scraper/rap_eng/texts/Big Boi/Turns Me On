[Intro: Big Boi]
Niggas don't fuck with a nigga like me
'Cause a nigga like me don't fuck around
Niggas don't fuck with a nigga like me
Cause a nigga like me don't fuck around, around

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown + Joi]
I know you see that
No one's competin'
Ooh and that turns me on
Ooh, that turns me on

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
What turns me on about ya? I doubt ya have a clue
Sassy attitude and red bottom shoes got 'em mad at you
I do think you're fierce and that you killin' them, of course
With the features of an angel and the bottom of a horse
Thoroughbred, thorough head makes you moist
Like the dark fudge brownie with the nut of your choice
Soakin' wet are the feathers in the goose down
Who's loose now? You done let the juice ooze down
Do smile, when you do it's on some "O-o-h Child"
Kiss you in the mouth, Juicy Fruit make you cool down
The naked truth, now ain't it true now?
Devine nectar, respect her, it ain't shit for me to prove, gal
You need some time, press the snooze down
I don't mind 'cause I'm hard as all the iron in the tool house
Or tool shed, go and play it how you play it
When alarm sound off, round two is up ahead, yeah

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown + Joi]
I know you see that (It ain't goin' down without ya)
No one's competin' (For what, girl? I already got ya)
Ooh and that turns me on
Ooh, that turns me on

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Who gives a damn about the past?
I live for today, plan for the future, pack a lunch and haul ass
Anyway, it ain't no time for no picnics
This that business, the slickness that get yo' chick hit quick
I make her drip all her liquids
Then get butt booty naked when I spit on some pimp shit
Make her leg shake so she never loses interest
Callin' out my name when I'm askin', "Whose is this?"
Nah, it's not a game, ass fallin' out the frame
With my Polaroid camera, I have to take two flicks
She can't avoid all this stamina, we do this
With no steroids or other artificial juices
Therefore, she knows the undisputed truth
When I slip into the boudoir or slide into this booth
I'm kickin' it with you, ma, like martial artists do
We can break boards and you can kick rocks or I'm through

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown + Joi]
I know you see that (It ain't goin' down without ya)
No one's competin' (For what, girl? I already got ya)
Ooh and that turns me on
Ooh, that turns me on

[Bridge: Joi + Sleepy Brown]
Sit yourself down on my big ol' bed
Turn ya body 'round here, let me give you some
Don't you wanna make a freaky memory with me?
So later on you can think about it then you'll be like, "Damn!"
It turns me on

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown + Joi]
I know you see that (It ain't goin' down without ya)
No one's competin' (For what, girl? I already got ya)
Ooh and that turns me on
Ooh, that turns me on

[Outro: Big Boi]
From the back {*playing backwards*}
Now from the front
Up in ya gut
More than enough
{*scatting*} Yeah...
