[Intro: André 3000]
Woo, woo
Yosky-wosky, peesky-weesky
What'cha wanna do-ski?
Nathaniel
Niggas get jacked like Daniel
Something I can't handle
Yo, unkay

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Yo, this is my story, this is my song
And to them rudypoos don't attempt to try this at home
It's just a poem until y'all learn right from wrong
Know when to bless a situation, when to grab the chrome
But it's back on, another stormy night in Atlanta, Georgia
Overcast, but on behalf of Outkast, I cordia-lly
Invite you to an emotion-filled theater
Bring your umbrella 'cause young fella it gets no weirder

[Hook: André 3000]
We reign, reign, supreme, 'preme
Dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now, now just hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

[Break: OutKast]
You are now about entering the fifth dimension of ascension
Our only intention is to take you high
High, yeah, yeah my Lord

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
To make one bob they head would be the track job
Your job's to spit that fire
Some of y'all MC's take this rhymin' for granted, I won't comply
With that slackin', poppin' and crackin' Fourth Ward say we snappin'
They want that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
What's happenin', see if do what yo won't do today boy
Will I live tomorrow like you can't even live 'cause you strayed
Motivational skills lackin', when I see you nigga you packin'
Understand that though, you behind a $75,000 car doe
But still stay with mom though, playing the King like Don doe
You choked up, you was the nigga that supposed to be so loced up
Makin' them think Hip Hop is dead, exhume the body if you ain't scared
And if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg yeah

[Hook: André 3000]
We reign, reign, supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now, now just hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now, now just hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

[Outro: Kid (of Kid 'n' Play)]
And the winner is—ladies, help me out—OutKast!
(Crowd erupts)

[Big Boi]
Goodie Mob in the house. Yeah, word, what's up? Goodie Mob in the house, yanamsayin'. We wanna say what's up to New York, yanamsayin', 'cause we from Down South, namsayin'. Is New York up in this, yanamsayin'? Are y'all in here, yanamsayin'?
This y'all city, yanamsayin'. We just wanna say—yanamsayin'—wanna say what's up to all the original MCs out there, people out there that who got their own stuff. So what's up, Dré?

[André 3000]
Yeah, first of all, yanamsayin', I wanna thank God. Just—namsayin'—dead serious. 'Cause if it wasn't for him, yanamsayin', we wouldn't be here. But it's like this though: I'm tired of folks, yanamsayin'—them closed-minded folks, yanamsayin'. It's like we got a demo tape and don't nobody wanna hear it
But it's like this, the South got somethin' to say. That's all I got to say
