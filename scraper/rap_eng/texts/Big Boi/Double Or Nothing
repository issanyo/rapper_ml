[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
They say the good die young, I guess I'll be here forever
A step away from the edge, the edge is closer than ever
Skeletons in my closet, I'll never live to regret 'em
So if you're looking for mercy you came in the wrong direction
I came from a different league, bred from a different breed
Vengeance and demolition is mixing, twisted with greed
Oh, the irony of a bleeding heart while it beats
Cause in the heart of the city the blood is shed in the streets

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Shed in the streets, my semi-auto's get to the beat
And I'm gone skip to the loot my darling, no surrender, never retreat
I'm never gonna see the light at the end of the tunnel, only darkness
It is me, God and the heartless partner bullseyeing targets
So fuck the Devil's Cartel, B.I.G. just slithing throats
Just like a table full of spade players, we taking out the joker
Urge gotta exploit sales getting big, go bag up guns
Cause it's faster and more furious where I'm from, run

[Hook: B.o.B.]
It's double or nothing
They firing from the door
They firing from the door
It's double or nothing
I think they're trying to go to war
Now we quick to turn your cabbage into coleslaw, boy

[Verse 3: B.o.B.]
Fuck I look like slipping? I don't chance mine
Got triggers on the clock, bitch, it's hammer time
On the part of the map where anything can happen
You either end up strapping or end up pushing dandelions
So [?]
I paint a picture that cameras can't
I got ammo for your [?], change the channel champ
Cause if we gotta turn up we got ample amps

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Yeah, in the cattle ranch where the beef love us
We brothers don't take no shit like septic tanks and toilet seat covers
Meatlovers, but only checking their seafood
They feeding on bottomfeeders cause they be food, I'm hungry
Matter of fact, I think I'm starving, it's the army
But never lonely, army of two, me and my homie Bobby
Weaving, it's the killing season
We leave 'em hardly breathing
So bring your extraction team and ghost

[Hook]

[Verse 5: B.o.B.]
The heat of the summet, the height of the storm
The belly of the beast, the stomach, the fire's are warm
The higher the prizes the higher the warning
Couldn't dodge them bullets if you hired an army
Whenever a soldier dies, a fighter is born
I used to think this type of lifestyle was the bomb
Until they wired up on me
I never grabbed a gun till fire one on me
It's nothing like surviving a gauntlet

[Verse 6: Big Boi]
Survival of the fittest, and boy I'm fit to lead
I make you bleed your own blood, visit emergency room
They send you straight down to the morgue
So you lay down in that bag where you eternally snore
You see the fat lady done sung that song
Like a change gone come, cause boy you headed to the funeral home
And now the only way you're coming back
Is if you reset the game, console then that's wack

[Hook]
