[Intro]
Hey man, when was the last time you went tea-bagging?
Must be tea time!

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Be still, young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be still, young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be wise, my dear, you must learn to just be still
Until you really, really know
Show me you're right, shine your light
I wonder when will I know

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
To hell if I don't prey
Like a mannequin in the window, I don't say
A word, I like to sit back, observe
My heart says do not disturb, and yours
Is like a doorknob, everybody get a turn (Yeah)
Now that's a turnoff, girl, I'm not concerned
More like the early bird tryin' to get the worm, worm
But not on those terms, you got on my nerves
Say I don't deserve you, you're gonna learn
Treat it like a perm, leave it be or let it burn (Burn)
Eat 'em like an urr-ange, orange
So when they on the verge of leavin', it don't get borin'
Foreign trips are taken just to see your smiley faces
Time's a-wastin' and I don't like to waste no time
You can be down or... yeah

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Be still, young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be still, young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be wise, my dear, you must learn to just be still
Until you really, really know
Show me you're right, shine your light
I wonder when will I know

[Verse 2: Janelle Monáe]
I love being in love (Being in love)
Then you let me down, turned my heart around
Givin' up on love makes my ocean drown
You lived in my heart
Secret melodies haunt me at night
Maybe lies and lullabies
This is my last farewell
You let me down

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Be still, young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be still, young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be wise, my dear, you must learn to just be still
Until you really, really know
Show me you're right, shine your light
I wonder when will I know

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yeah, from behind the Cadillac do'
Grip this wood, slide around real slow
Just thinkin', mind blown
As I glare through the smoke tinted windows
I be still

[Chorus: Janelle Monáe]
Be still, young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be still, young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be wise, my dear, you must learn to just be still
Until you really, really know
Show me you're right, shine your light
I wonder when will I know

[Skit]
I came up here, finna come down and get me something to eat, take me a bath, know what I'm saying?
Bubba walked over to the phone booth, askin' 'bout the blue flame
I told 'em they ain't got nothin' but some big booty hoes down there
Alright
Ain't no drug transactions being made, I don't sell no drugs
So, so where did he get the crack from?
Boy, I could not tell you that! If I had some crack, I would be smoking it, I use drugs, I don't sell no drugs
Okay, so we gon' take this little 30 dollars then book it into evidence
We ain't got to do that, brother! I sit down and told you I ain't sold that man no crack, I don't know where he brought that crack from!
I had them same 30 dollars that I had when I walked over there, 'cause I'm goin' in my pockets to get my money out and make sure I had change to use the phone!
