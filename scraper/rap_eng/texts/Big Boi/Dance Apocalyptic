Dance apocalyptic
Bands they make her dance apocalyptic now
Bands they make her dance apocalyptic
Bands they make her dance apocalyptic now
(Ah!) Bands they make her dance apocalyptic

[Verse 1]
You're going crazy, the hitmen always finds you
Do that dance, smoking in the girls room
Kissin' French, itâ€™s over like a comic book
Exploding in a bathroom stall (AH!)
She's so freaked out, worrying about the bomb threat
You bought a house, but I'm allergic to the house pets
Credit cards
They bought a new wife for shiny little lonely men

[Hook:]
But I really, really want to thank you for dancing 'til the end
You found a way to break out
You're not afraid to break out
But I need to know if the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you freak out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop
Chalang-alang-alang
But I need to know if the world says its time to go
Tell me, will you break out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop, chalangalangalang
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop, chalang-alang-alang

[Verse 2]
You gotta life, but the zombie's in the front yard
Take a bath, but nothing gets the funk off
You're on TV, rockin' and a rollin'
'Cause the dead just love to rock and roll
Sick and tired of food tasting plastic
You wanna cry, but they grew up without a real kitchen'
Asking why the pain is always equal
But the joy just never spreads around

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You're going crazy, the hit man always finds you
Do that dance, smoking in the girls room
Kissing friends, keep a rockin' and a rollin'
Cause the dead just love to rock and roll
So freaked out, worried about the bomb threats
Bought a house, but I'm allergic to the house pets
Credit card, you're working and a-bobbing
Just to make enough to pay your rent

[Hook]

[Spoken Outro]
I've been...
Look at you
You look just like a little old earthquake
Break it, break it
You got to break it
Ain't no order in this courtroom
(Smash, smash, bang, bang)
Y'all going to jail
(Don't stop, chalangalangalang)

[Spoken: Android Voice]
What's the matter?
Your chicken tastes like pork?
You have triplets instead of twins?
Is your food taste plastic?
Grandaddy, I think I wanna dance
