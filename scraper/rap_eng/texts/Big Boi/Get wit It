[Chorus: Big Boi]
Now it's a few rules to the game if you really wanna play
Let's get this straight off top
Bitch get wit it (Bitch, get wit it)
And roll up (Roll up)
Can't talk about it, be about it, we gon' have to see about it
Yeah, and get wit it, get wit it...and roll up, roll up

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Isaiah 54:17, no weapon formed against me shall prosper
I got a whole team of angels guarding me from all the danger
And keep that .357 under my seat for all the haters
Rappin', one of the last rap niggas snappin'
Niggas playin' sleep, I'm St. Nick with the package
Blessed with the gift and only 3 Stacks can match me
Light years ahead of you niggas, another galaxy
Boi keep the club packed to capacity
Hands in the air. bitches make it clap for me
Automatically, the DJ bring it back for me
And drop a bomb on it with the horns (Yeah)
Globally adored
For sure put Atlanta on the board and I'll be runnin' up the score No etiquette like Belichick and Brady on you hoes
See, now teamwork make the dream work, that's how it goes

[Chorus: Big Boi]
Now it's a few rules to the game if you really wanna play
Let's get this straight off top
Bitch get wit it (Bitch, get wit it)
And roll up (Roll up)
Can't talk about it, be about it, we gon' have to see about it
Yeah, and get wit it, get wit it...and roll up, roll up

[Post Chorus: Big Boi + (Snoop Dogg)]
Gotta keep the money coming on time (Money)
Need to go ahead and get your mind right (Paper)
Recognize it's pimpin', bitch, you gon' get wit it, roll up
Blowing on strong all day
Shawty keep looking this way (Say what?)
She recognize the pimpin' and she gon' get wit it
And roll up

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
First thing she seen when I fell through
A little bit of talk but I walks with a clear view
Dynamic, organic, Iceberg Slim selling trim on the Titanic
Underwater wit' it, let me show you how to do it to the fullest
I'm the hardest, I'm the realest, I'm the dopest, I'm the coolest
While I'm doing, while I'm doing, check it out
And I ain't gotta have a motherfucking record out
I'm just a West Coast player, say 'fee fi fo'
Long Beach nigga with that Eastside flow
Dipped in the sauce, 'imp with the limp
I'm a pimp and a boss, let me show you how to get it off
Keep a blue flag to the left of me
And shoot my shit with trajectory
Big money, big cars, big toys making big noise
Holla at 'em Big Boi

[Chorus: Big Boi]
Now it's a few rules to the game if you really wanna play
Let's get this straight off top
Bitch get wit it (Bitch, get wit it)
And roll up (Roll up)
Can't talk about it, be about it, we gon' have to see about it
Yeah, and get wit it, get wit it...and roll up, roll up

[Post Chorus: Big Boi + (Snoop Dogg)]
Gotta keep the money coming on time (Money, money)
Need to go ahead and get your mind right (Get it, get it)
Recognize it's pimpin', bitch, you gon' get wit it, roll up
Blowing on strong all day
Shawty keep looking this way (What she looking at?)
She recognize the pimpin' and she gon' get wit it
And roll up

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
I'm true to it, had a yellow Cadillac
And I sold my blue Buick
Spend a lot of money but I'll never blow through it
Never blew through it
Only thing I blow through is pussy, I'm never pushy
In my youth I used to lock it but I don't (I loved her)
Like that, because I'm married and I won't (Do nothin')
Split that pie up, no more, it's gone
Since Thanksgiving, I split it four ways, it's wrong
Wrong all for my kids and my family
First generation Patton clan, bitch, get at me
I's da pappyâ€”the papi and the father
The only Maury I rock with are gators or [?]
Crocs, I'm sharper than your Sharper Image
In your catalog, nigga, eat your spinach
Or your leafy greens, long BB team
We don't see no seeds, it's straight bud like their roses

[Chorus: Big Boi + (Snoop Dogg)]
Now it's a few rules to the game if you really wanna play
Let's get this straight off top
Bitch get wit it (Bitch, get wit it)
And roll up (Roll up)
Can't talk about it, be about it, we gon' have to see about it
Yeah, and get wit it, get wit it...
(You gots to get wit this shit, mayne)
And roll up, roll up (It's real pimpin', man)

[Post Chorus: Big Boi + (Snoop Dogg)]
Gotta keep the money coming on time (We gettin' money)
Need to go ahead and get your mind right (Straight pimpin')
Recognize it's pimpin', bitch, you gon' get wit it, roll up
(Recognize when it's in your face, you little bitch)
Blowing on strong all day (Yes, sir)
Shawty keep looking this way (Ya dig?)
She recognize the pimpin' and she gon' get wit it
And roll up

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Say man, she got to choose up, man
I thought you thought, man
Bitch been looking at me all motherfucking night
Yeah, get in where you fit in
Hahahahaha,,,
