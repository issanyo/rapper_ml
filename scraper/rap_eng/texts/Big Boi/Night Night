[Intro Skit]
Woah, woah â€“ what you got me charged with?
We're gonna have you charged with possession of cocaine with intention to distribute
Man, I ain't sold that, man! That, man, why is you doin' that, man?!

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
The rhymes I design are truly unrefined
Like diamonds with a speck of blood, dug up out the mine
Flows flood between the ears, right behind my eyes
Giving birth to the lines, soul search for the prize
I takes my time when deciding what to write
Like the SAT, while these other niggas bite
Underrated and mostly hated but got a lot of fight
Like a player, play the background, fuck the spotlight
Night, night, I recite when I step up to this mic
Reputation trunk tight, like the husband on a wife
Stay sharp as broken glass, get busted on the smash
When your ass cross paths with this half of the 'Kast

[Hook: B.o.B & Big Boi]
It's bed-time, tuck yourself at night
Can tell that you're terrified
Check my record, you will see that I'm verified
Dope nigga, nobody want none (I terrorize)
Don't nobody want none (Now you're terrified)
Nobody want none, nathan, this none (It's bedtime)

[Interlude: Big Boi]
Yeah, this where the second verse supposed to go
I don't even think I need to hit y'all with another verse
But I, I think I just might
Because I like to destroy shit

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
There's no retreat and no surrender
Been ready for battle, General Patton's no beginner
I keep it all Madden, I call the play then execute for the W
Leave the rest to you, destitute, now put that money up
Oh, your conscience is nonsense
How you expect to get a little restitution with all this ghetto flyness?
Snow, that's for toboggans, no, won't be no pardons
Or bargains, three striked, then yanked up like a rod
Uh, with no apartments, and no home to run to
You're snitching on yourself, and now your front door, they come through
Without a tap on your phone
The only thing they had to do was listen to the raps in your songs

[Bridge: Joi & Big Boi]
Lights out, the time for nighty night's long overdue
This is the final countdown to your swan song, you are through
All wack MCs and posers, this is going out to you (To you)
The boys will drop their jaws in awe 'cause here comes something new
Here, here comes something new
Something new, something new, something new

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Straight out the plastic, like a pack of puddings, no show
My nigga, you can not see me, and that's fo' show, fo' do'
Any kind of Cadillac, I go slow
When I'm smokin' on some of that choco, no low, no mid
Top of the line pine, 'cause I blow big
Been 'round here for a while
Your mama like my style, and so do your kids
I know you love it, because a hater loves to hate
Boy, you need me like a junkie need a razor blade and plate
I'm dope, nigga

[Hook: B.o.B & Big Boi]
It's bed-time, tuck yourself at night
Can tell that you're terrified
Check my record, you will see that I'm verified
Dope nigga, nobody want none (I terrorize)
Don't nobody want none (Now you're terrified)
Nobody want none, nathan, this none (It's bedtime)

[Bridge: Joi & Big Boi]
Lights out, the time for nighty night's long overdue
This is the final countdown to your swan song, you are through
All wack MCs and posers, this is going out to you (To you)
The boys will drop their jaws in awe 'cause here comes something new
Here, here comes something new
Something new, something new, something new
