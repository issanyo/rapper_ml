[Verse 1]
Some people talk about you
Like they know all about you
When you get down they doubt you
And when you tip it on the scene
Yeah they talking 'bout it
Cause they can't tip on the scene with you
T-t-t-talk bout it
When you get elevated
They love it or they hate it
You dance up on them haters
Keep getting funky on the scene
While they jumping round you
They trying to take all your dreams
But you can't allow it

[Chorus]
Cause, baby, you're high or low
Baby, whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope
Baby, whether you're high or low
Baby, whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope
And I'm still tipping on it

[Verse 1]
See I'm not walking on it
Or trying to run around it
This ain't no acrobatics
You either follow or you lead
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you
Or keep on blaming the machine
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout it
T-t-t-talkin' bout it
I can't complain about it
I gotta keep my balance
And just keep dancing on it
We getting funky on the scene
Yeah, you know about it
Like a star on the screen
Watch me tip all on it

[Chorus]
And, baby, you're high or low
Baby, whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope
Baby, whether you're high or low
Baby, whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope
And I'm still tipping on it

[Bridge]
Ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, whether you're high or low
Baby, whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope
And, baby, whether you're high or low
Baby, whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope
And I'm still tipping on it

[Outro]
And I'm still tipping on it
And I'm still tipping on it
And I'm still tipping on it
And I'm still tipping on it
