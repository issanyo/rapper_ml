[Chorus: Slick Rick]
Been trying to claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
What kid? Diamond on the tooth 2 grand
Trying to help raise all youth to man
So give the Ruler Rick his space to slam
Help clean up this land
The reputation of this man
Withhold and withstand

[Verse 1: Slick Rick]
OutKast and Slick, the answer is in it
Hon you need to get your ass on the dancefloor this minute
We bruise stuff, knock you out shoes, socks
Show your ass, move your fuck out, we're mad smoove snots
La-Di-Da-Di, mmmmm we like to party
Don't make me get money and platinumize my body
With bright stuff, known to earn a dyke's love
Blind folks be like, "Somebody turn the lights off"
Immense rep, poppin out a muffin
Make famous artists that's dead hop out a coffin
At the real estate, behavin type choosy
Want a palace with the shit beige and light blue please
Got the kid like "watch your manners"
Since I came out of jail, it's like the planet gone bananas
Lack of strength a badder fella had
Lady lookin at me all stink, I had to tell her that

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
Don't try to claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
What kid? Diamond on the tooth 2 grand
Trying to help raise all youth to man
So give the Ruler Rick his space to slam
Help clean up this land
The reputation of this man
Withhold and withstand

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Uhh, I went from Player's Ball to bulldoggin
From bulldoggin to bowhoggin
Now bowhoggin and pimpwalkin
That strictly fresh and street talkin
And we all last like that there
Ruin them all up like cat hair
We never fall off like hat wear
We some of the dopest MC's out there
Now eat that, OutKast and Ricky D, bitch, can you beat that?
Remember the time I laid them down to Teenage Love?
Now see that
Just to sport a rhyme and break in new patterns like hymens
Shuckin' and jivin' was never the style
I'm gon' keep on being this lion
Spittin' that king shit, you cling shit
A tailor and a seamstress
Blue gators for you haters and the penis for all you beatches
Like an addiction 'cause I need it, hip-hop is that I fiend it
Like a junkie showin' your monkey, 'cause I sho' nuff like to beat it
Might just eat it just to skeet it
Fold you up like you was pleated
Like some slacks and, relaxin', be strollin' like Sir-Captain
See, I got a, baby daughter, and I feed her with this rappin'
Not trappin', d-boy, but rappin', huh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
Don't try to claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
What kid? Diamond on the tooth 2 grand
Trying to help raise all youth to man
So give the Ruler Rick his space to slam
Help clean up this land
The reputation of this man
Withhold and withstand

[Verse 3: Slick Rick]
Seems everybody's open off the grammar
The white fox pink velvet suit, white cabana
Listen baby girl, genius Rick ta..
Dreamboat wish, you shoulda been clicked picture
(Check her out) I don't know what you're tryin to figure out
Down South, barbecue ribs fly out a nigga mouth
And touchin' me The Chosen, for such a will opposin
Me and Big Boi tryin to give our children clothing
Smokin' loveâ€”do we provide dope enough?
Even people unborn kid wide open off
The enginin' I'm sendin' in
Even make construction workers start actin kind of feminine (Hi)
10%'ll blast this hit from me and Big Boi
Who represent the OutKast clique
A jealous cat, lack of strength a badder fella had
Lady lookin at me all stink, had to tell her that

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
Don't try to claim things I haven't earned honest, man
Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
What kid? Diamond on the tooth 2 grand
Trying to help raise all youth to man
So give the Ruler Rick his space to slam
Help clean up this land
The reputation of this man
Withhold and withstand

[Outro: Slick Rick]
Slick Rick and OutKast is on this jam
Tryin to help raise all youth to man
So give the Ruler Rick his space to slam
