[Hook: Sam Chris]
We go through this every day
Adding more to the story trying to make it more interesting
Lying to yourself like it really happened
It's like we're riding on a never-ending train
Pick a stop (pick a stop), pick a lie (pick a lie)
Pick a reason to convince 'em that it never happened
I guess nobody really cares when we're all laughing
I think you'll have to save the day

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
But not like Captain Save
More like black Captain Kirk 'cause Big Boi's from some other place
Oh, way deep in outer space where the freaks are not afraid
To crank that bitch in the moonlight while nobody's getting paid
Galaxies of slaves, enter Dungeon Family
With OutKast, Goodie Mob, & P.A., now we Gnarly like Barkley
Without Harley Davidson, maybe someday you will see
Boy, we been done gave you some, the pipe has already been laid
Foundation sturdy as ankle weights or shoes of cement
Be ready to sprout them wings or choose to cruise like a fish
We wish, but need to pray we don't stray away from this
Kids, common sense ain't common
When your mind's trapped in a fence
But mines is that intense, hence the way that I spit my shit
'Cause I'm a fire breathing (fire breathing) dragon in this bitch
Which is a girl dog, yet a pitfall
For me and y'all, songs found no bombs, but the ones rock
It's all wrong

[Hook: Sam Chris & Big Boi]
We go through this every day
Adding more to the story trying to make it more interesting
Lying to yourself like it really happened (Really happened)
It's like we're riding on a never-ending train (Choo choo)
Pick a stop (pick a stop), pick a lie (pick a lie)
Pick a reason to convince 'em that it never happened
I guess nobody really cares when we're all laughing
I think you'll have to save the day

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Look up, up and I pray, channeling that heavenly energy
There's plenty we can say
See the enemy is winning 'cause your punk ass be afraid
But I spray what's on my mind to educate and entertain
KRS, he said it the best, I learned from listening to these tapes
Before i-iTunes came out and made a CD obsolete
For reality TV would seem to be that big mistake
Now Big Brother's got these cameras
Deep in each and every state
While each and every rapper claims to be the heavyweight
'Cause he mentions cocainia in 'bout everything he make
And they wonder why them people tryna pin him with that case
'Cause his blow his dixie crystal, pistol play was just for play, fake
Just for play, play... but got them bay-bays believing that bullshit
I said, just for play, play... but got them bay-bays fucked up

[Outro: Sam Chris & Big Boi]
Plus I think I, I think I (He said, he said, he said)
Sometimes I think I love it (Sometimes I think I love it)
And I think it loves me too
Plus I think I, I think I (He said, he said, he said)
Sometimes I think I hate it (Sometimes I think I hate)
And I think it hates me too (And I think it hates me too)
I think it hates me too
Just for play, play... got them bay-bays
Just for play, play... got them bay-bays
Woo!
