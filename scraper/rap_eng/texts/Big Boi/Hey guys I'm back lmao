[Verse 1]
R-I-C-E, burb mopper, curb stomper
Going fucking crazy, come on, you gotta stop her
I'm a childish bitch, I'm a fucking kidzbopper
Y'all suck a cocka cause I know y'all tryna cop a
Bunch of bullshit, y'all an insecure flock of
Mothafuckas but y'all know I'm tryna cook a
Dish of stir fry, Fried Rice, smells nice
Fuck that emo shit cause I'm back, guys
God damn it, Rice is back for year 10?
I thought I'd never have to see him again
Got you running back and forth like the pacer test
I'm on house arrest, put those gays to rest
I'm back lmao, I spread her legs like mayo
My police report just came in through the mail
Sundays at the hospital, Mondays at the court
Your daughter's deformed, why didn't you abort

[Bridge]
Me and Danyael never do no toy, nah
Call us Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, yah

[Verse 2]
ABC to the 123
I'm sitting at this curb drinking Iced Tea Memes
Deep, you want to go deep, sure I'll take you deep
Deeper than J. Cole's asshole, neat (WOAH!)
Spending my days in court but I ain't coming up short
I'm the fucking goat, take off your hat and your coat
Risotto Pavarotti, they thought that they got me
Fuck you little bitch, you're just little thotty
Thotty, thotty, thotty, but fuck it let's party
Fucking beat my meat, like I'm protesting Arby's
AriZona Iced Tea, sip on that a little bit
I don't even know where I'm going with this shit
Roses are red, this message is urgent
Who the fuck calls laundry sauce 'detergent'
You be acting fishy, bitch you're a sturgeon
I wanna beat my meat, my fucking dick is urging
I'll operate on your pussy, I'm a fucking surgeon
Switch your gender like traffic lanes, you're merging
Gotta Google reasons why, I'm a search engine
Your balls are fucking blue, Thomas the Tank Engine
