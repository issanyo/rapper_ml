[Intro]
Yo...
Love...
I don't know

[Verse 1]
Guess I'm just caught between my heart and mind
Wanting it to be good, knowing it's not;
Crying all the time, praying that a change gonna come...
(Yeah, that's just like the other day, he came at me...)

Hit on my hip, like, "Just touched down (down), wanna see you (you)
I know you're mad at me, but baby, I'm so sorry, sorry..."
(And you know, I just get tired of hearin' the same old line...)
I just wanna be...

[Chorus]
Happy, sipping, puffing, passing
Relaxing with my family - No more tears for you...
(Mm, no more...)
Dancing, laughing, writing, singing
Rocking to hot tracks like this - No tears for you...

[Verse 2]
Guess it's 'bout time, I'm due another love;
Messin' with this nigga got me fallin' apart...
I don't wanna be someone I know I'm not...

Call me on the phone like, "Baby get dressed (get dressed), I'm scooping you up. (Up...)"
I waited for an hour, he never showed
[Shit, I went to get cocktails with my girls, it's a new year.]
I just wanna be...

[Chorus]
Happy, sipping, puffing, passing
Relaxing with my family - No more tears for you...
(No more tears for you...)
Dancing, laughing, writing, singing
Rocking to hot tracks like this - No tears for you...
(No more for you...)

[Bridge]
No more tears... (Oh, oh, there's no more, said no more, can't be no more...)
No more tears for you... (No more, can't be no more, no more, can't take no more...)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da... (Mmm...)
La-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da... (I just wanna be...)

[Chorus]
Happy, sipping, puffing, passing
Relaxing with my family - No more tears for you...
(No for you...)
Dancing, laughing, writing, singing
Rocking to hot tracks like this - No tears for you...
(No more tears for you...)

[Chorus]
Happy, sipping, puffing, passing, (No more...)
Relaxing with my family - No more tears for you... (Just wanna relax and chill...)
(You see, baby...cause life with you ain't been no joy;)
Dancing, laughing, writing, singing
(I'm just tryna get over you, boy...)
Rocking to hot tracks like this - No tears for you...

[Outro]
No more tears for you...
No more tears for you...
No more tears for you...
