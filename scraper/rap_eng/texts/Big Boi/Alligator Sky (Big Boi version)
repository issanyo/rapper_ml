[Chorus - Adam & (Big Boi)]
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I’ll never know what’s up ahead (you never know)
I’m never letting go
I’m never letting go

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Never letting go, although sometimes I slip
Like banana peels for heels, my skill is so legit
Notice this - every time I pick the microphone and spit
Eyes wide, ears open like you're on a doctor's visit
But this ain't physics or rocket science
This is a little tune to keep you motivated and inspired, I am
Not a motivational speaker but people get easily motivated when they hear B-I-G wreakin'
Havoc on this mic, block rabbit holding tight out
Sit and growl with me - cruising, grooving through the night skies
Put your fly bowtie make my mark like the craters on the moon, rockin' alligator shoes

[Chorus - Adam & (Big Boi)]
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I’ll never know what’s up ahead (you never know)
I’m never letting go
I’m never letting go

[Bridge: Big Boi & (Adam)]
Ro-roller coaster through the atmosphere
(I'm drowing in this starry serenade)
Where ecstasy becomes cavalier
(My imagination's taking me away)
Reverie whispered in my ear
(I'm scared to death that I'll never be afraid)
I'm on a roller coaster through the atmosphere
(My imagination's taking me away)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Ta-ta-take me away like (?) in a bubble bath
You gon' need the Hubble telescope to see where the landing gear stop
Can the tear drop? The commander of the space shuttle (-----?)
The final frontier, flashlight in the abyss
This little light of mine gon' shine above your distant
Cross it off your bucket list, destiny fulfilled
Be a fish out of water, live your life full of thrills

[Chorus - Adam & (Big Boi) (x2)]
Where was I when the rockets came to life
And carried you away into the alligator sky?
Even though I’ll never know what’s up ahead (you never know)
I’m never letting go
I’m never letting go (letting go)

[Outro (x2)]
Okay take me away
Where all the wild things go, we say
Okay take me away
Where all the wild things go
