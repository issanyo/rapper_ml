[Hook]
Don't fuck, don't fuck with the braids
Can't fuck, can't fuck with the braids
Don't fuck, don't fuck with the braids
You can't fuck, you can't fuck with the braids
You can't stop me, how then
Watch me, watch me; ain't gonna be no Congress
Drop me, you can't block me; who stop me, it's outside
You should've known better, is it cause I flow better
They kept me in the shade
But now I'm back motherfucker, the nigga with the cannon for two
Swinging with the braids

[Verse 1]
The dough man, got dogs in when the rhymes go bad
Make ink on the page, catch flame, lit light like propane
No sweat, no blood, no pain, no game
No card, no deal, no dice, no game
Giving these bitches something vicious
I got them falling to pieces, like porcelain dishes
I'm dirty, I get all the way down on the ground
And just wonder, memorize, take a picture, write a book
I don't give a fuck
I man supply, ground-ripper
I'm here, lay down and give it up
Nigga you ain't gonna leave me out my entrance
Count a hundred thousand pennies, every sentence
Buddatt, buddatt, buddatt, get back
What's happening
I rip cracks and pop tapes
I'm so hot they just gotta rock what I spray
The type of guy that write what I say
I'm so wild, cause I'm round where them crocodiles play
Can't be none there
I make you say oww; give it to me, step it up
Don't be that way I'm tearing ya, cause they tell ya with the music
I been doing this shit, how to train em, how to use em
I'm a gangsta, better pop up respect
Take a piece of lectum, maximum effect ya
But eclectic, ground perfected
It just don't get no colder, bet you if I won't effect it
Y'all niggas couldn't pop a rubberband, you fucking with the man

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bitch bout fifty-five, goddamn it
Get into it, get off; get down, get cross, get tied
For my Million and my Mychelle
My Mama and my brother and my nephew and myself
The man upstairs, cause I kept it up
For my niggas, and my rounds, back down
Bout to step it up (step it up)
Put in some cash and some Outkast beats
Hop behind the wheel and come out from the fucking backseat
Michael Tyler, rhyme and droating driver, miracle rip plyer
The fasthold desire! On fire, reach a flyer, ain't nobody lie
Starting them out of a team, city of Seam
With 100 suckers and a busta
And I'm still clean! Hollering hi-ya
Right before I chop you in your throat
Another rapper say I'm on my way
To get the fucking hat and coat, and hit the motherfucking door
You can't stop me! How then
Just watch me, watch me
Ain't gonna be no calling Congress
You can't drop me, you can't block me, who stop me
It's outside, you should've known better
Is it cause I flow better, they kept me in the shade
But now I'm back motherfuckers
The nigga with the cannon for the two
Swinging with the braids
