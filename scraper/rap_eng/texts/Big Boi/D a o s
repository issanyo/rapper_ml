[Intro: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi]
It's like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Llac now
We just shoot game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now

[Verse: Andr√© 3000]
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha, Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber
Party but you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning yawning dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above
Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said what you wanna be, she said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home
To find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper

[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi]
It's like that now, you better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Llac now
We just shoot game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now
