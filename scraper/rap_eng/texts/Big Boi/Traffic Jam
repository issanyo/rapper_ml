Raps I’m an addict man
If you’ve got the mic, then I have ta stand
Cruise slow, bass up, windows down, this a traffic jam
Bass up, windows down, this a traffic jam
Yeah raps I’m an addict man
If you’ve got the mic, then I have ta stand
Cruise slow, bass up, windows down, this a traffic jam
Bass up, windows down, this a traffic jam

[Verse 1: J5 Oh]
Technical rhyming impeccable, best with incredible, flexible, legibles
Plentiful, epochal, pressing the decibels
Sentinel's retinals skeptical of the spectacle
Say I’m not seminal and get hit with a testicle
Yeah, that’s balls to the face
Come back when your sac falls into place
I’m all in the race when the key turns right
Pedal to the floor yeah the sneakers white
Ticket picked, shoes laced so Mike me
Likely to be sitting in the Garden with Spike Lee
Nike, I just do it, I’m a wonder, fantastic
You don’t like me: you don’t understand rap bitch
Practice makes perfect, so why ain't that my Momma’s name?
Ha, balling and calling shots, call that Obama game
Been taking time making sure my shit stay popping
Now you can stop asking when the mixtape dropping

[Verse 2: Wex]
I ain't got swag, and I don't need it
They play it cause I say it, ain't got to be repeated
But he got to be conceited way he rock the beat the meanest
Would he cop discreet from cleaners? Nah, he screened it like it's Zenith
So that's a special showing, and I'm the best at flowing
And when it gets to going you could say the nest is growing
Piece by piece, how I reach my beats
You just cease thy lease and then leach guy meats
See you a dick sucker, and I'm a bitch bucker
I book a slut and hook it up, like a hitch trucker
I'm Chris Tucker, way you rush (h)our tactics
And stand like Jackie Chan, fuck yall backflips
Bumper to bumper, we crowded like in Pakistan
I'm front and center, you just shrouded in the back again
Fine and white like powder in the packet fam
I slam, god damn, it's a traffic jam

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J5 Oh]
Competition got em panicking, frozen like a mannequin in Flannigans
Deadly with the metal in hand, like I’m Annikan
Damn, success, you can’t force it, young padawon
Fuck that I’m gone, I’ll bust in with an atom bomb
I’m on; I’ll create more life than Adam’s dong
Every eve I’m freeing from my ribs and even badder song
Truth is, I’m ruthless, go nuke where the booth is
The youth who’s the smoothest, fresh and clean like the blue Crest
Fly like the blue jets, with some dudes, yes my crews best
NY ball like the new Nets, more animal than a zoo gets
I’ll be high with a Jewess and a Brazilian girl who debuts Guess
Whoa… replay button's there, it’ll be fine if you do press
