I'm goin' outta my mind, I never felt so gone
Baby, you know that I'ma be someone
Sign of the times, you better get you some
Everyone shinin', I gotta ﬁnd it

Sittin' on a wave, on a wave far away
Sippin' on the fame till the taste gone
Send 'em to the bank, to the bank, keep the change
Livin' every day till it pays off

I don't wanna get caught up
I could never just slow down
I'm just tryna get on up

I'm goin' outta my mind, I never felt so gone
Baby, you know that I'ma be someone
Sign of the times, you better get you some
Everyone shinin', I gotta ﬁnd it

I want them big bills
To see how it feels
(You gotta get you some)
Don't want no cheap thrills
So gimme big bills
(I wanna get me some)

Everything is gold for the show, for the show
But you ain't even know what you paid for
Spendin' all you own, easy come, easy go
So lemme get it all, what I came for

I don't wanna get caught up (Caught up)
I could never just slow down (Slow down, baby)
I'm just tryna get on up

I'm goin' outta my mind, I never felt so gone
Baby, you know that I'ma be someone
Sign of the times, you better get you some
Everyone shinin', I gotta ﬁnd it

I want them big bills
To see how it feels
(You gotta get you some)
Don't want no cheap thrills
So give me big bills
(I wanna get me some)

I don't wanna get caught up (Yeah, yeah)
I could never just slow down (Yeah)
I'm just tryna get on up

Sittin' in my 'Ilac, in my 'llac, in my 'llac
Still countin' up these racks, pilin' bag after bag

I am still movin', stay shinin'
Can't nobody stop my grindin'
Oh, fuck, nigga, gon' get behind me
Still sittin' on bread from the 90s
Never fall out boy, we stay climbin'
Up, up the charts, it's all perfect timin'
Been platinum, went diamond
That's 10 mil sold one album
Still ill real co-sign rhymin'
Big bills, big grills
All gold, everything, I'm smilin'
Weekend, get away on islands

I want them big bills
To see how it feels
(You gotta get you some)
Don't want no cheap thrills
So gimme big bills
(I wanna get me some)

I don't wanna get caught up (Caught up)
I could never just slow down (Slow down, baby)
I'm just tryna get on up
