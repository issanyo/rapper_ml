[Intro: Rick Ro$$]
Ricky Ro$$
It's somethin' special right here
Excuse the marijuana, just tryin' to join myself
We got some gangsta's in the house too. Come on!

[Chorus: Avery Storm]
I got a bunch of dollars
I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady
She can be my lover
Call me on the late night
Get right he ain't actin' right
Every super woman needs a super man
Here I Am

[Verse 1: Rick Ro$$]
Sight seein' we might be in the codra port or that new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face
Next semester she transfer to Florida state
Cookin' like home-etch for financial aid
I highly doubt she has problems with financial aid
Remember mean time my finance is straight
I even open up the doors to the panantial states, Boss
She used to fight with her moms
'Til I sat 'em both down
Now she's tight with her moms (what?)
Yeah I put the ice on her arm
Now she know she gettin' sliced
Spending nights in Milan (yeah)
We still blow... together
Cheated on her but we still gon' be together
With the house on the water hit the beach whenever
She's from the north & still can't believe there whether Boss

[Chorus: Avery Storm]
I got a bunch of dollars
I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady
She can be my lover
Call me on the late night
Get right he ain't actin' right
Every super woman needs a super man
Here I Am

[Verse 2: Nelly]
Here I Am & here I go
Why you lookin' for that other when you got the best?
The previous was a test for you
Now you in the big leagues
A black Sine brother who wouldn't wanna play for me?
Your last man was a chump
& you can tell him I said it
He was talkin' alot at first
But you can see that dead it
You can see I ain't sweat it
Hell I'll even call him myself
& tell him I dead it
Naw Please don't confuse me miss
I'm tryin' to see if I could put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think your ass fine as shit
& That's straight up real talk, all bullshit
Aside she replied
"I Like To Do The Wild Thing"
Action took place at my place
Now my place is her place

[Chorus: Avery Storm]
I got a bunch of dollars
I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady
She can be my lover
Call me on the late night
Get right he ain't actin' right
Every super woman needs a super man
Here I Am

[Verse 3: Rick Ro$$]
Mo' better mo' cheddar not the man off your clothes last sweater (what)
Hoe getter gorilla fuck chuffers
I went & got mo' killers boss
I rock with Niggas like Fabolous
'Cause He tell the truth baby like Fabolous
But you make it look glamorous
Here's spaghetti strapped heals not for amateurs
Risk quite rocky, talk like foxy, job like roxy
Spark that broccoli walk quite aky
Let me sexy I will save you if you let me
Fly with me, get high as me
Alot of alphabets girl I'm a G
Time will tell, Rolex watches
We show stoppers, hoes just watchin'

[Chorus: Avery Storm]
I got a bunch of dollars
I can spend them on her
'Cause she can be my lady
She can be my lover
Call me on the late night
Get right he ain't actin' right
Every super woman needs a super man
Here I Am
