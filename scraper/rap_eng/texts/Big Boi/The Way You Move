Boom, boom, boom
Heh, heh

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxin', Outkast is everlastin'
Not clashin', not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little actin'
Now that's for anyone askin'
Give me one, pass 'em
Drip, drip, drop there goes an eargasm
Now you cumin' out the side of your face
We tappin' right into your memory banks thanks

So click-it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattlin', like two midgets in the back seat wrestlin'
Speaker box vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass

I like the way you move
I like the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turnin' left, turning right are they lookin' at me?
Well I was looking at them, there, there on the dance floor
Now, they got me in the middle feelin' like a man-whore
Especially the big girl, big girls need love too
No discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak

Skinny, slim women got the camel-toe within 'em
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out "Timber" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep a breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend, boyfriend was boring as hell
Well let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail on the low, hoe

I like the way you move
I like the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

Hey baby, girl don't you stop it
Come on lady, dance all around me
You look so fine, look so fine
Drive me out of my mind, out of my mind, out of my mind
(Ooh baby)
If I could, I would just leave with you, baby
Ooh, 'cause you light me and excite me
And you know you got me, baby

I like the way you move
(I like the way you move)
I like the way you move
(Ooh, so sexy baby!)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
(I love the way you move)
I love the way you move
(Ooh, you so sexy baby)
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I like the way you move
I like the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
