[Hook: Wavves]
Shoes for running, and I'll race ya
Sun is coming, it'll chase ya
Through this dead beat town
Through this dead beat town
The end is coming, I would race ya
But there's no running, it'll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
What about the people that's barefoot
With no shoes for running when the sun come up?
Hey one percenters, the 99 say what you gonna do for us?
We'll run up in your house like the first runner up
Be the first one to buck and the last one to get laid down, stay down
And now we're looking at the top of the pile
Or the king of the mountain gonna knock him off
Revolt, but y'all niggas here too soft
Bubblegum, just popping off
At the mouth like the nigga got all the hoes
Got all the dough and all the women
Boy, what you gon' do in the penitentiary
Got a lot of money, can't take it with me
I can't take it with me, I wish they could send me
To the moon and back with a cure for cancer
And save the lives of my great grandmama and my great grandaddy
Now that's the answer to the question
But they make money of the medicine
Leaving us all stuck in elections
With no progressions, just recessions

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
Just as I expected, life gets deadly
It's funny how the beloved become the beheaded
The truth can be independent or the direction that you stretch it
So my niggas will draw when shit gets sketchy
That's a masterpiece, a work of art
A gallery, not photoshop
Pictures say a million words, so I just let my photos talk
Even in your local talk, niggas say you know he boss
Everytime my name is brought up better know it's mogul talk
That's why she give me geek 'till her shins weak
I'm blazing everyday, you can call that demp week
You're running from your life that you didn't see
That's like playing hide and seek with the Grim Reaper

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
You can run, but you can't hide
Spent your whole life trying to escape
When everybody stayed
Getting tired of living in a lie
Different nights, same town
Say goodbyes, but we tried
Cause we know there's no getting out
And when the pawns are playing themselves
I just lay and wait and straighten myself
Let them war out till they wear themselves out to the rhythm sells out
Bring them back to life, give them mouth to mouth

[Hook]

[Outro: B.o.B.]
You can fight and try to get away
But there's nowhere to run and hide to
You better know that there will come a day
Eventually it's gonna find you
