[Intro: Chris Brown & Big Boi]
This sounds like an elevator music
Chris Brown, Big Boi, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Hook, line and sinker, I knew she was mine the day I seen her
Got a big mouth bass on the line, it's time for me to retrieve her
And go get her like a wide receiver, but we don't play no ball
See when it comes to you baby girl, B.B. don't play at all

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
On the real we need to nip this in the bud
Cause we kept it real with everyone
So tell me why they hating, everybody's hating
It feels like they just waiting for us to grow apart, yeah, it's just hard for me to do
But baby if I'm your man, I guess I gotta be a man
These men just gotta understand
Little girl with curves and hips, luscious lips
Girl I can't front now, I'm nervous

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And I'm like hold up, wait, wait a minute
I'm genuine with it, I ain't tryna put no pimping in it
And I'm like hold up, can I talk to her? Hold up, can I take her out?
Hold up, uh, that's why I gotta tell you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Nowadays is so crazy out here, you'd wanna cut and leave
If your daughter struts with me, lucky me
And you'd be lucky too, no entourage, no crew
Just me riding with my boo, I got her, but don't think I'm replacing you
Girl I know you know what I do and I'm a major minor
It'll take days and days and decades to find another
Dude, that's gon' walk in my shoes
And girl keep it one with you as long if you do the usual

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And I'm talking 'bout hold up, wait, wait a minute
I'm genuine with it, I ain't tryna put no pimping in it
And I'm like hold up, can I talk to her? Hold up, can I take her out?
Hold up, uh, that's why I gotta tell you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Baby please, hang up the phone cause I'm talking to your father
Mr Jones, Mr Jones, I've been talking to your daughter
And she likes me, she told me she likes me
And I really like her, she gon' be my wifey
Baby, please, hang up the phone cause I'm talking to your father
Mr Jones, Mr Jones, I've been talking to your daughter
And she likes me, he told me she likes me
And I really like her, she gon' be my wifey

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And I'm like hold up, wait, wait a minute
I'm genuine with it, I ain't tryna put no pimping in it
And I'm like hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, you, that's why I gotta tell you

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Now is the time for me to come clean
Now is the time for us to turn that yellow light to green light and proceed
Us together, be more better like lemon pepper on your wings
And you'll never find another fellow that's better than your king
Know what I mean, know what I'm saying, know what I'm talking about, girl who is playing?
But we can't have no picket fence cause we got acres and acres of land
The haters are taking it mad that we can handle these fakers with class
Mannerisms on that C.O. five and a half on they ass
Girl bye, give it a try, give your boy a chance
Ever since you landed in my space it seems like I'm yours again
My top friend, drop them, we don't need no audience popping
For approval or applause, not them

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And I'm like hold up, wait, wait a minute
I'm genuine with it, I ain't tryna put no pimping in it
And I'm like hold up, can I talk to her? Hold up, can I take her out?
Hold up, uh, that's why I gotta tell you
And I'm like hold up, wait, wait a minute
I'm genuine with it, I ain't tryna put no pimping in it
And I'm like hold up, can I talk to her? Hold up, can I take her out?
Hold up, uh, that's why I gotta tell you

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Baby, please
And she likes me and I really like her
Baby, please
She gon' be my wifey, baby, please
