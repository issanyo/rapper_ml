[Intro]
Jag k√§nner att jag faller

[Hook: Little Dragon]
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
You will never know
If ya don't, if ya don't

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
When I think back, I'm glad I lived it all
The pain when I'm thinking about it, dad
I will not fall, even tired and all
Grandmamas, great grandmama they gone
My daddy's gone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Little Dragon]
Hey, even with a storm to face, I still stand tall
I take beyond, the city I was born and raised
Lights, lights turn off, running along my own way
My body lift up, even when I go stray
By now you should know us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi](Little Dragon)
From the bottom of my chest to my stomach
Got damn it, my daddy is gone
(From the waves that rock I listen for you
I'm listening through)

[Hook]
