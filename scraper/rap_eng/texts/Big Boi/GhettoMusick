[Intro: André 3000]
Whoo, turn me up, don't turn me down
Cut me up, don't let me down, find, find a way

[Chorus: André 3000]
Find a way to get out, without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out, without a doubt
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick

[Interlude: André 3000]
Climbing out this hole (Climbing out this hole)
With a frown on my face
(In the place to be) In the place to be
And not to be at the same time

[Pre-Chorus: André 3000]
G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us

[Chorus: André 3000]
Find a way to get out, without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out, without a doubt
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick

[Bridge: Big Boi & Patti LaBelle]
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Hot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony
As my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse, she showed me
How to be the smooth operator, dominator
In the state of Georgia, hip hop standard destroyer
Leave a muthafucka open like a foyer
He from the dirty,, now here come the paranoia
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth, this
Planet's standards trust and the purpose
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame
You've obtained, you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff, locked up, no possibility
Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear, we disappear
Then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy
'Cause if it's not, we gotta fight like

[Pre-Chorus: André 3000]
G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us

[Chorus: André 3000]
Find a way to get out, without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out without a doubt
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick

[Bridge: Big Boi & Patti LaBelle]
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?
