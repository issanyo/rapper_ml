Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Free falling, Thom Pettie
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Freefalling, we up all night

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
I rock one chain for medallion
With a whole lot of motherfucking diamonds
It’s astounding like when I be rhyming
Always shining like the sun and moon
Like a hot air balloon requires fire
No methamphetamine, but nigga we get higher
Big Boi, dopamine, I mean I’m dope
And nary one of you niggas can come close
'cept for Fat Sacks
Been a serial killer, oh nice to meet you, best believe that
Like Ripley’s boy, don’t tempt me
I fuck around and leave your Kool-Aid glass half empty
Your time is running, I’m just like the sand in it
Been jammin' in half & half of you niggas know you can’t get it
That’s right, it as in IT
We like the apple on your iPhone, niggas always biting

[Hook]
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Free falling, Thom Pettie
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Freefalling, we up all night

[Bridge: Little Dragon]
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
And climbing up the moon
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
And climbing up the moon

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
(Motel, hotel)
Motel, hotel
Intercontinental, all cause a nigga push a pencil
That’s an S550, not a rental
Bitch, I don’t even ride Lincoln Continentals
In the rear seat is a fat black nigga with a smile like Denzel
Pretty model bitch with me moving bout as graceful as a gazelle
Skinny as a pencil, fold her like a pretzel
Hit her with the XL
Just in case this funky-ass bitch was doing intel
I'm-a give her news she can go tell
Snitchin'-ass bitches get evicted, no bus fare
Grown-ass women ride a Bentley that’s so clear
I’m so player, SpottieOttieDopaliscious
Mama phony but I swear to God the pussy dope and she delicious
One time for my wife and my mistress, gone

[Hook]
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Free falling, Thom Pettie
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Freefalling, we up all night

[Bridge]
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
And climbing up the moon
We shining like the sun and moon
All of your wishes falling through
They chasing after you
And climbing up the moon
