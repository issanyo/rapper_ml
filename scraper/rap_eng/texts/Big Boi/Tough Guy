[Refrain]
Everbody on the streets
This a little thesis coming from me
When I throw up baguettes, sitting at the bar
Or smoking a little red life in my car
I don't know what you came to see
Nigga just out here feeding my kids
Throw up the duece and let me slide on by
Cause everybody wants to be a tough guy

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Cruising down the street, minding my business cause I'm trill
Stopped at the ATM, grabbed a thousand dollar bill
Now I peel like apples and peaches because I'm chill
And niggas around my city respect me because I'm real
But still the things I see from day to day it irks me
When I'm off in the '79 Seville or the Bonneville
Niggas wanna hurt me, absurd G
I know it, betta believe I tote something for it
And I got a slogan like Nike but it goes like this, just know it
And I'm not the type of person be riding around your block just flashy
Just came to the store to get some black and milds and a lil bit of 93 gas,G
Wanna blast me, get sassy, say negative things about OutKast G
Riding all on a nigga dick, all you had to do was just dap me, come slap me
You the bad man, so go ahead and touch my cheek then
But we'll be burying you and your whole motherfucking family by the weekend
I'm calling your bluff, go on and buck, I got my squad we trapping
Aye C-bone gone slap this nigga, he ain't bucking, he just yapping, yea

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Say, we took it from packing the pistols
To jacking this missiles, to stacking my crystals
Now my torpedo's even cracking your missile
When we start, ain't no stopping us
We too smart and too popular
Take your toys and we topple em
Resort to the dopplar
To the agent underground well known as Stankonia
Where trill as niggas go one and bad ass bitches be boning ya
I'm warning you, niggas i'll fill the middle of your moany
And make yo broad lick her pony up, its that platinum shit
Called zonia, tell Tommy blow me up
I ain't Mariah, bitch I'm the messiah can't no motherfucker show me up
UGK a set nigga, throw me up
Fuck catching a case bitch, i'll lace you and your homey up
Cause we the cream coming out of the crop
The steam coming out of the pot and the team coming out at the top
Your baddest or not, these niggas getting shattered or shot
Splattered for props, man you should'nt've left your gat at your spot

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Pimp C bitch I'm a country star
I got a country mansion and a country car
I got a country bitch, I made a country son
I got some country nuts, I keep a country gun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
So if you pay me a mil, you gotta give that nigga one
Fuck boys talk shit, but them bitch niggas know
And UGK run the streets and we put dick in your ho
Whether weed or blow, I keep an open store
I keep my hair cut low, .44 on the floor
You can test me Snow, we got the glass for sho
Get your mind on your money, cause you playing with your dough
Bitches who ready to go, say you moving to slow
If you wasn't bout sucking it, what you fucking with me for
The quarters in the side in case you didn't know
I'm Sweet Jones Bitch and I'm an old school pro, pro, pro

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Since the beginning of time, up to the present of now
There are beauty shop playas also intelligent clowns
Got they blue cuts with brown, booty grinding the ground
It's the sound that's created when we get up to get down
Stimulate my imag-ination with exag-geration of stanking light
That can't be right but we laughed
To keep from crying, sighing, hugged by cutie-pie and
Death defying acts of a Blacks not scared of dying
Y'all act like you never take no bubble bath
Gone to Blockbuster and act like you ain't never cuddled after
You poked her, stroked, soaked her, provoked her
To reach for the sky when she's high on your holster
I'm posed to, roast you, toast you, close you
Motherfucking mouth for I'm almost closed to the end
So when they ask you what school do you attend
Say Stankonia High, then throw two in the wind
