Cool, moving cool, moving cool...

[Andre 3000]
Cool, moving cool...

[Andre 300 and Joi]
Moving cool, moving cool, yeah...

[Andre 3000]
Hey, hey!

[Joi]
Hey, hey!

[Andre 3000 and Joi]
I can make a stone cold blind man see a better way
But when I'm around, you don't have to much to say
La, la-la, la-la, whoo, whoo

[Andre 3000 (talking)]
You see there will always be someone, taller, darker
Maybe wit a little of cheese than I got
But really, shawty you don't need nobody else

[Hook: Andre 3000]
Cause baby I am (I am) the opening act (the opening act)
The headliner (the headliner) and the after party
After party, after party, after party, after party

[Joi]
I am all that you'll ever need
I trip on how everybody see's what I am but you
I thought you'd be brave enough to taste my bitch's brew
Well I thought I was dealing with a man, but you're a boy
You're a boy, you're a boy
I can give you everything you want, but I can't be your toy
Oh no, oh no!

Hey shawty, look here for a minute, shawt, shawt
Oh, my bad, my bad execuse me
You corporate America, you corporate America...
I meant to say lil' lady, you look so lovely lying in wait
Like a lemon licorice, lollypop
Waiting to be licked, we don't play
But you think the shit
Was that too harsh for you lobes
Too heavy for your mentality I suppose
Got nerves like kryptonite
Superman couldn't bend those
Kindness kills callous
Like a D-Boy movin' fifty P's of that work
From A-Town to Dallas movin' cool
