[Intro: Phantogram]
One more drill
One more drill
One more drill
One more drill
One more drill
One more drill

[Verse 1 - Big Boi]
Always and forever
Forever and always, always together
Like salt and pepper
We live life like a love letter
Real nice like them love letters
Amen tell 'em
I stole her heart like a known felon
Jackpot couldn't have chose better
Banana dick on deck, she goes gorilla
If you ain't got yours yet, the boy gonna get her, for real uh
On the phone with her til the wee hours
Future's so bright, who can see ours?
Usin' all three eyes to get between thighs
Always overstood, never undermined
Got a mean spit game and the dutty wine
Spoon action, gravy for the cuddle time
And under the cover we make another Twan
Fuck it, make another one

[Hook: Phantogram, Big Boi, Sarah Barthel]
One more drill
No matter what you say to me you'll always be a goldmine junkie
One more drill
No matter what I do to break your heart, I know you'll always love me

[Interlude - Sarah Barthel]
Always is the plan right? (Damn right)
Huge ring? (Damn right)
I deserve it, I'm worth it
Besides you fit perfect
But that's our secret, can you keep it?
I'm a junkie for you when you need it
When you leave the feelings you leave me with
(I'm knee deep in it), I'm knee deep in it

[Bridge: Big Boi]
Overdosin' off devotion, we can never get lonely
The only one that can do somethin' for me totally mind blowing
And I'm never letting go, these streets ain't got nothing for me
It's full of skeezers and phonies, bloodsuckin' leeches that owe me, homie

[Hook: Phantogram, Big Boi, Sarah Barthel]
One more drill
No matter what you say to me you'll always be a goldmine junkie
One more drill
No matter what I do to break your heart, I know you'll always love me

[Verse 2 - Sarah Barthel]
He's a guy, give him one more try, I'm listenin'
Through your eyes I can read your mind, it's blisterin'
Every time you say one more drill
I gotta dig myself out of the way, I feel
And now the gold is really coal and sparklin'
Take me down where shooting stars are flatlinin'
Every time you say one more drill
I gotta dig myself out of the way, I feel
Cause I need you

[Hook: Phantogram, Big Boi, Sarah Barthel]
One more drill
No matter what you say to me you'll always be a goldmine junkie
One more drill
No matter what I do to break your heart, I know you'll always love me

One more drill
No matter what you say to me you'll always be a goldmine junkie
One more drill
No matter what I do to break your heart, I know you'll always love me

One more drill
