[Hook: Mr. Porter]
Now ever since I was a young boy
I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man
I'm still in love with the tricks that you can do (I still love the tricks you do)
I'm used to women think it's nasty
That's they opinion but that ain't my point of view (That's just they opinion cause they ain't you)
Some of them need to take some lessons
And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

[Verse 1 - Devin the Dude]
{"Devin, the Dude.."}
When I was young I was sprung off the way women used their tongue
I couldn't nut yet, but fuck that, it was still fun
To look... I took... vaseline
Even though it was thick and rubbed it on my dick
Now I'm grown...
... and my bone is so well-known hoes wanna get it cloned
Shit, ain't nothin wrong with you chunkin that monkey
All up on me 'til the whole room's funky
The negative thoughts, it's time to change
Shit, you a woman, I'm a man
It's all natural, and we're compatible
I'll bend you over, knock you down, slap that ass a little bit
(ohh ohh) But not to hurt
Like after havin a full course meal, it's the dessert
Now lay on your stomach, put a arch in your hips
And look back so I can see all four of them lips

[Verse 2 - Bizarre]
{"Bizarre.."}
I can on Superman drawers, I'm 6 years old
All in my room, all alone
I'm young, dumb, layin the pipe
Showtime, HBO, Friday night
Butt-naked on the couch, without no clothes
Remote control, ready to bust a load
And fuck Roxanne, I want Big Ann
Tight old pants, my mother's best friend
I watch all your movies and your DVD's
I heard you're comin out with a porno CD
I want Janet Jacme, to smack me
Take your bikini off, get on the bed and attack me
I love porn, but niggas be hatin
R. Kelly ain't got nothin on the shit I be makin (I'm 14!)
I'm a freak, I been that way since 7
Me, Big Boi and Devin; bitch is 11

[Verse 3 - Big Boi]
{"Big Boi, from OutKast.."}
I like a lady, but I sure love a slut
The type that like to sit on my dick and let me scrub them guts
The chick that want it doggystyle while pullin on my nuts
And when you aimin for her face shorty don't be tryin to duck, uh
True Aquarian, mean I'm freaky as to fuck
Eat that coochie for an hour after you shower cock 'em up
From the power of the orgasm your legs are lockin up
Caught a cramp in your thigh, can't even pull your stockings up
But your spike leather collar plus stilletos lookin tough
Now you're passed out on your stomach, seems though you had "Enough"
Like J-Lo in that movie where her husband beat her up (bitch!)
Puss appears to be pregnant, swole and wet up
Now you need to go on and get up 'fore I set up some more setup
I done caught my second wind, let's begin, lift your head up
It's the battle of the sexes, we can do this shit 'til breakfast
I don't want no mo' babies but I can give you a baby necklace
