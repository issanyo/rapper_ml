[Chorus: Pimp C]
They wanna know what's going on in the South
Now tell that bitch to keep my name up out ya mouth

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Two rollies at the same time, I'm too cool
Gucci, is you locing? 'Cause that motherfucker Crip blue
Suwoo Bentley and the Forgies Suwoo, too
And I know two Jews, eat a case like it's fast food
I bought a T-rex on these niggas 'cause life's cruel
My jewels so cold that you might get the slight flu
Bird's eye view, I'm looking down at the lil' dudes
And if I had to, pussy nigga, I'll rob you
You wanna see me locked 24 just like cop do
You hate from the sideline, that's what yo' job to
Gang mentality, I think like the mob do
Police brutality, I'm strapped like a cop, fool
My dope boy do numbers just like my shows do
My main bitch rolling for me just like my hoes do
These suckas say they comin for me well cook me some soul food
I'll MapQuest yo' house, and I pull up with a trunk full

[Chorus: Pimp C]
They wanna know what's going on in the South, in the South
They wanna know what's going on in the South, in the South
In the South, in the South, in the, in the South, South
Now tell that bitch to keep my name up out ya mouth
They wanna know what's going on in the South, in the South
They wanna know what's going on in the South, in the South
In the South, in the South, in the, in the South, South
Now tell that bitch to keep my name up out ya mouth

[Verse 2: Big Boi and (Pimp C)]
Even though the radio refuse to give us airplay
Bump this shit in your Cadillac, your Cutlass or box Che-vy
Hea-vy, Timothy McVeigh, knock it down like OKC, boy
And ain't no nigga on ya playlist
Fucking with a A-list nigga like B-
I-G B-O-I, why? Effortlessly fly, I
Tend to overthink when I ink these bars
But y'all niggas don't even try
Ball till you fall or your homies die
Pour out a little liquor, let one in the sky
Don't cry, let the doves do that when the guns go 'brrrp'
Now that's what we call the pop life, true that
(They wanna what's going on in the South, in the South)
A nigga kick back at the house with my flipflops on
Got an ounce on the couch, blow a bag
Crack her jaw open, we all smoking
And some of us even taking shots going in
Jello, Tito's, white Hennessy, that brown liquor ain't yo' friend
My G, we know...

[Chorus: Pimp C]
... What's going on in the South, in the South
They wanna know what's going on in the South, in the South
In the South, in the South, in the, in the South, South
Now tell that bitch to keep my name up out ya mouth
They wanna know what's going on in the South, in the South
They wanna know what's going on in the South, in the South
In the South, in the South, in the, in the South, South
Now tell that bitch to keep my name up out ya mouth

[Bridge: Miss C.C. La Flor, (Pimp C), and Big Boi]
Big Chevy's bending corners, speakers thumping
Yeah, we make a scene
That dirty, dirty in yo' ear, crystal clear
Yeah, we got what you need
Big Chevy's bending corners, speakers thumping
Yeah, we make a scene
(Know what's going on in the South, in the South)
That dirty, dirty in yo' ear, crystal clear
Yeah, we got what you need
(Now tell that bitch to keep my name up out ya mouth)
Call, call, call, call me Daddy Fat Sax
Call, call, call, call me Daddy Fat Sax
Call, call, call, call me Daddy Fat Sax
