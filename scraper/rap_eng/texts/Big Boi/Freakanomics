It's Freakanomics
That's why every dime is making money
Got it down to a science, yeah, she studied
Since the beginning of time
Every girl I see got a PhD in Freakanomics
(Yeah)
It's Freakanomics

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
She say she want to see me but I got me somebody
I tell her see you next lifetime but she want me today
And if I give her D, then she will never go away
We went from watching a lil movie to me drilling for babies
Now she know that I know that we know we fucking
All up in each other like it ain’t nothing
No cuffing, just busting
Don't stop till you get enough of the hip-thrusting
Trust me, always in a must-win
Fall back, what, you thinking I’m a husband?
Boyfriend? Bae? Naw, give up the drawers
Forever in the friend-zone? Yes we are

[Bridge]
I know it may seem, I’m falling for her plans
I know it may seem, she’s got me eating out her hands
She’s not my lady and I am not her man
See, that's just my friend and we gon’ let you do the math

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
And anytime I want to get down I hit her line
Round after round while I piped her spine
Spine is the kind when you just touched down
You had a long flight but you wanna bust now
Or later, like the candy, come out the panties, please
Got to be polite with all these freaks, freeze
Tag the moon over the stars, into the Boomiverse we are
She said she want to see me but I got me somebody
I tell her see you next lifetime but she want me today
And if I give her D, then she will never go away
We went from watching a lil movie to me drilling for babies

[Bridge]
I know it may seem, I’m falling for her plans
I know it may seem, She’s got me eating out her hands
