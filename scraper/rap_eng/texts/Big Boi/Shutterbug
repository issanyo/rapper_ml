I keep it player while some choose to play it safe
Boy, check the resume, it's risky business in the A
And I been witness to this history
Ever since the tenth grade, we went from rockin' braids to ten fades
I twist my A hat to the side, just for style
Or throw on the Gucci bucket with the flowers, super fly
While the southern pride been known to shut it down
It ain't so country though, nigga, this ain't no Gomer Pyle
I'm Sergent Slaughter, I keep my shit cooked to order
In order to satisfy my people in Georgia and 'cross the water
And across the border, the eses are getting smarter
They got flour for tortillas and lettuce for enchiladas
If you follow, wink, wink, no doubt, we don't speak
In a blink, them folks can have you sleepin' in the clink
I'm shittin' on niggas and peein' on the seat
It's that nigga the B-I-G B-O-I, O-U-T
Now party people in the club it's time to cut a rug
And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs
I'm double-fistin' and you empty, you can grab a cup
Boy, stop, I'm just playin' let me back you up
Baby, baby, you're in my system
Baby, baby, tell me you're listenin'
Boy, it's after twelve, club like a Hi-V
A beehive, cause now everybody buzzin' around me
Could it be the way the verse's sounding?
Came up the Ghetto Boys and the Underground Kingz
Toys, I had a Brougham, called it Pretty Brown Thing
Paint looked like root beer when the sun was shining
Known to keep a bad bitch, no niggas beside me
And this finger on the trigger, case niggas is clowning
Not to flex, but to protect my neck like the Wu Tang
Self-preservation is the rule when you do aim
Or get in something more sinister
You gotta be the finisher, make it so the doctors, they can't replenish him
Or bring him back to life, back to reality
Go on, get 'em some ho's, leave it alone
Triple O.G. status, A-town's very own
Now party people in the club it's time to cut a rug
And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs
I'm double-fistin' and you empty, you can grab a cup
Boy, stop, I'm just playin' let me back you up
Baby, baby, you're in my system
Baby, baby, tell me you're listenin'
Now this goes out to all my players in the back
Sippin' 'Gnac, bendin' 'round corners in the 'Llac
Cut a rug, player not, cut a rug
Throw your deuces in the sky for the shutterbugg
And this goes out to all my ladies in the front, what you want?
You make me want to breed, girl, freeze
Cut a rug, maybe not, cut a rug
Throw your deuces in the sky for the shutterbuggs
Now party people in the club it's time to cut a rug
And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs
I'm double-fistin' and you empty, you can grab a cup
Boy, stop, I'm just playin' let me back you up
Baby, baby, you're in my system
Baby, baby, tell me you're listenin'
Tell me you're listenin', got you all up in my system
I can feel you from my head to my toes
(You're in my system)
Lucious Left Foot got his best foot forward
God, lord have mercy, how them flow stay so cold?
(Tell me you're listenin')
Froze
Cut a rug, cut a rug
(You're in my system)
Shutterbugg
Cut a rug, cut a rug
(Tell me you're listenin')
