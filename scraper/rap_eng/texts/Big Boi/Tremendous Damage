[Hook: Bosko]
Sometimes I wonder how I get over
The weight of everything is tearing up my soul but
Shit is heavy like the world on my shoulder
People telling me be strong like a soldier
But I suffer tremendeous damage
Just make it fade away
Just let it fade away
Just make it fade away
I suffer tremendeous damage

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
So many things that I didn't know
But still I've seen my dreams come true
And now the little kids are watching my videos
And telling me "I wanna be you"
See, I'm just a man so I ain't scared to fall down
No matter what ever I go through
I told the man in the mirror keep pushing on
But I can't say the same about you
Nah nah, nah, I done made it this far
And ain't no way I'm gonna turn back
I started out with no car
And graduated to a Cadillac
But all that money don't mean a got damn thing to me
Cause we don't worship that
But like the Wright brothers, you gotta crash and burn
Before you take flight, I know ya heard that

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
February 28th, the day my daddy died
Well, not really, his energy passed to the other side
And ever since that day I've seen him fade away with my own eyes
I never doubted God, the Marine corps they say semper fi
My daddy fought in Vietnam
This is a fun fact for the bloodline of Antwan Andre
Just like this song say
I've suffered tremendous damage, got me tougher than a motherfucker
And since the days of Player's Ball
Y'all thought it was about all these broads and slamming Cadillac doors
Now your American idol is just a fraud
You kiss a man he's still gonna be a frog (ribbit)
A bitter old negro not at all
See, I look 26 and still hit your broad
Still pitch a ball, hike, pass, shoot, kick and all
Practice make perfect and first it was Bamboo now it's Cross

[Hook]
