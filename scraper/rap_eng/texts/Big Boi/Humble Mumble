[Intro: André 3000]
Ah, I stank I can, I stank I can
The funky engine that could
Ooh, ooh, yosky, wosky, pisky, wisky
All aboard the Stankonia Express
The underground smell road
Everybody's lookin' for an excuse to let loose
What's your locomotive, the Chatta-nigga choo choo?

[Hook: André 3000 + Erykah Badu]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Back on the microphone, your number one controller
I rock the microphone like a blizzard
I'm so cold I'm tryin' to hold ya
Life is like a great big roller coaster
Everything in life don't happen like it's suppose to
Trials and tribulations make you stronger live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
Everything don't always happen like you plan it
Demand it; over stand it then you handle it
Fuck wishing you, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switching why you quitting cause it's heated in the kitchen
Sloppy slipping in your pimping nigga
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger
You've got to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams
"No Weapon Formed Against You Prospers" 54:17
From Isaiah, lay a, nigga down and spray 'em
If the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards you've gotta play 'em

[Hook: André 3000 + Erykah Badu]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Yeah, too Democratic, Republic fuck it
We chicken nugget, we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
Blue-collar scholars, who'll take your dolla, and wipe my ass with it
You living for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic, I made her shit her draws
She said she thought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol
I said "Oh hell naw!", but yet it's that too
You can't discrima-hate cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision the decision
Do you want to live or wanna exist?
The game changes everyday, so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it

[Hook: André 3000 + Erykah Badu]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

[Verse 3: Erykah Badu]
I'm wild just like a rock, a stone, a tree
And I'm free just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow just like a brook, a stream, the rain
And I fly just like a bird up in the sky
And I'll surely die just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then one day, it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way
And there it lays, until the rain and sun
Then I breathe
Just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow just like a baby blossoming
And it's beautiful
That's life, that's life
That's life, that's life

[Hook: André 3000 + Erykah Badu]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

[Outro: André 3000]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've gotta re-route my dreams
Y'all can't harm me, it's over
