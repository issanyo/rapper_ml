Yeah, ya gotta understand what I'm talkin' about
I'm talkin' about on this one, sexy, sexy as hell to me, yeah, yeah
So let me tell ya 'bout the playa I know
Six foot four, two twenty-five, he's all the way live
See where I come from, we like 'em like that
He don't talk smack, he just twist caps off
So that's the only kinda dude I'm demandin'
And let the girl like me understand it
And the ones that ain't they still gotta have it
They don't know why but they stay chained to
I need a hood boy, wife beaters and chains
Always in the trap and he looks so mean
I need a hood boy, go on head pretty ***
We don't like them there need somethin' mo' realer
I need a hood boy, hot boys, rock boys, street boys, b-boys
Man I love them boys, yeah, yeah
He knows how to treat a lady but he won't let you get too rowdy
He stands up for himself that's what I like most about him
He's all I see and all I need and all that I want and all that I'm really used to
I swear to my man's the truth, I said I swear to my man's the truth
I need a hood boy, wife beaters and chains
Always in the trap and he looks so mean
I need a hood boy, go on head pretty ***
We don't like them there need somethin' mo' realer
I need a hood boy, hot boys, rock boys, street boys, b-boys
Man I love them boys, yeah, yeah
I need a hood boy, wife beaters and chains
Always in the trap and he looks so mean
I need a hood boy, go on head pretty ***
We don't like them there need somethin' mo' realer
I need a hood boy, hot boys, rock boys, street boys, b-boys
Man I love them boys, yeah, yeah
B A double D why say bye
Been fly ever since a n**** started sayin' bye
That's right stand by 'cause we about to take flight
Not a 747 but the music and the microphone home
If you got somebody waitin' baby, go on home
Don't wanna jeopardize your safety, maybe later
We shake the haters and gets busy
You say you wanna do same thing then get with me
If not then hit me I know you know the history
Last n**** ridin' round lookin' real crispy
Ridin' round town, top down on the grizzy
Grind all the time to stay hot or either sizzlin'
I thought I told ya n****** we run stop signs
'Cause we don't stop till the cops come knockin' for two block signs
Not mine, twine gone right like sunshine
And cold north through summertime, now bow down
I need a hood boy, wife beaters and chains
Always in the trap and he looks so mean
I need a hood boy, go on head pretty ***
We don't like them there need somethin' mo' realer
I need a hood boy, hot boys, rock boys, street boys, b-boys
Man I love them boys, yeah, yeah
Shortie wanna rock with you, shortie wanna rock with you
Wanna bop with you, I wanna ride with you
