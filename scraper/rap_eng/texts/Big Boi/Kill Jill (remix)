[Intro: Sample]
愛してよ　私を 抱いてよ　ねぇ、側においでよ
"Aishiteyo, watashi wo daite yo ne, soba ni oideyo"

私の　最後の　記憶に 君の愛を　残したい…
"Watashi no saigo no kioku ni kimi no ai wo nokoshitai"

[Verse 1: UpstatesFinest]
I-I-I-I ain't got no chill pill
Upstates about to Kill Jill
I kill bill, go Mike Will, who made it, bitch save it
I could dig and bury your favorite rapper
I could ride the beat that's white water rafting
Moving off from the liquor to a brand new acid
Been out of favors what the fuck you asking
It's my only blunt and I don't wana pass it
Oh you're looking great yeah that's cubans splashing
She's an 8/10 you know im smashing
Giddy up bitch go hoe oh heres the magnum
Show me dem tits know you love to flash em
Love pussy love cheques all I do is cash em
Love money love booty all I do is grab em
