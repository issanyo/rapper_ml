[Verse 1]
It is I, the B-I-G, the B-O-I
Me, oh my, ears to the street and eyes to the sky
Kept my sights on the prize, wide open, worldwide
Like the thighs of a hooker spread, told the girl, "Bye"
I got bigger fish to fry, niggas wish I would retire
'Cause of the pressure I apply every time I bust a rhyme
None of the rest of ya are tryin'
Watch me stimulate the minds of the masses
While you niggas kickin' it like jackasses
And who you votin' for, Republican or Democratic?
Don't say it doesn't matter 'cause that's how they stole the last one
Assassin's bullet might be waitin' for Obama
Do you think they'll have a brother before Billy's baby mama? C'mon!

[Verse 2]
My daddy told me it was mine for the takin'
A true gift from God, the stars aligned when they made me
Him and Rena's baby, their first born son
I'm Antwan André Patton, the only one
Bloodline of a champion with heart of the lion
I'm defyin' all the laws like a caterpillar flying
Way before my time and reside in the Dirty Dirty
Where they still hangin' nooses like we in the early '30s
Goddamn, you know who I am? ("Da-Daddy Fat Sax")
Royal fam of Atlanta, Dungeon, bitch, you understand?
This ain't what you want, let's be clear from the bungie
I write knockout songs, you spit punchlines for money

[Verse 3]
With my ears to the streets and my eyes to the sky
I'm on another planet, my nigga, and you just fly
(Why?) Cause I'm ("Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax")
Take that, motherfucker, take that!
With my ears to the streets and my eyes to the sky
I'm on another planet, my nigga, and you just fly
(Why? 'Cause he's Daddy Fat Sax)
Ridin' off in the Cadillac like that, nigga
