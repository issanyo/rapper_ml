[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
When that nigga be thinkin' of cruisin, the Braves cap is to the side
Thinkin' the police gon' pull me over with this herb off in my ride
So I hide the brick of weed, under the arm rest, under the leather
And thinkin' of startin' ways to make my life a little bit better
Than the dope peddler
Never to pay no fucking taxes
Takin' a chunk up out of my checks and makin' my rhymes just look like practice
Buying clothing, Range Roving with my folks
Don't speak about the Dirty South, my crew ain't bout no jokes
I know some people don't like the way we flow because they envy
They talkin' about they fucked my hoes and that they could have been me
You lookin' to be the butterfly, without the caterpillar
Take your time and do it right cause you gon' make it, I swear my nigga
Or collapse one, fallin' a victim to your greed, boi
You're lookin' to be Big Willie, but you're still a seed, boi
The information in my skull be pokin' some of y'all on the shoulder
But on the other side of the fence, they got y'all niggas breakin' boulders
For quick money

[Verse 2: Cee-Lo Green]
Strugglin's just a part of my day
Many obstacles have been placed in my way
I know the only reason that I make it through
Is because I never stop believing in you
Some people wonder why we here in the first place
They can't believe 'cause they ain't never seen your face
But even when you pray, the next day you gotta try
Can't wait for nobody to come down out the sky
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let Him do the rest
You've got your life, and got your health
So quit procrastinating and push it yourself
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let Him do the rest
You've got your life, and got your health
So quit procrastinating...

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time

[Verse 3: Andr√© 3000]
Uh, who said good folks is not supposed to die?
The same nigga that said niggas is not supposed to cry
United States giving out milk and cheese to pacify
I'm sure they got a cure for AIDS but yet it's classified
You wonder why I spit the truth and not to make no dough
To make a difference 'fore this motherfucker up and blow
In pieces
I could think of many reasons
Only when shit is going bad, you want to holla Jesus
Fuck a pledge allegiance, they got my knuckles bleedin'
From crawling
Got these niggas thinkin' they really ballin'
When they isn't
Don't take my word, there's niggas off in prison
That will tell you
That's locked up for long time and won't sell you no flex
So congregation, will you turn your text
To the book of OutKast, chapter two, verse one
The first one that feel me, jump up and make a joyful noise
You's OutKast-ed, meaning, now you have a choice, like that

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time
Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time
