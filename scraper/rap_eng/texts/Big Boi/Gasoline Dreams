[Intro: André 3000]
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright

[Hook: André 3000]
Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga 'round me playing married, or paying child support
I can't cope, never made no sense to me one day I hope it will
And that's that, sport, sport
Pray I live to see the day when Seven's happily married with kids
Woe woe, the world is moving fast and I'm losing my balance
Now time to dig, low low
To a place where ain't nowhere to go but up
You with me say shit, sho sho
Now let me ask y'all this

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
It's shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks
My cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing Fed time
On a first offense drug bust, fuck the Holice
That's if ya racist or ya crooked
Arrest me for this dope I didn't weight it up or cook it
You gotta charge the world cause over a million people took it
Look at me, I'm outta your jurisdiction now ya lookin' stupid
Officer, get off me sir
Don't make me call L.A. he'll have ya walking sir
A couple of months ago they gave OutKast the key to the city
But I still gotta pay my taxes and they give us no pity
About these youngsters amongst us
You think they respect the law
They think they monsters, they love us, reality rappin'
And giving the youth the truth from this booth
And when we on stage we scream
Don't everybody, everybody

[Verse 3: Khujo]
Officer of the most high
You touch me you touch the apple of his eye
If they kick us out, where will we go?
Not to Africa cause not one of them acknowledge us as their kin folk
Still eatin' pork
Abomination desecration for beating flesh
Penalty for violation is death
Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on Judgement Day
Hip Hip Hooray!
Mr. Reaper Babylon the great
The mother of harlots is falling, prophecy must be fulfilled
The lake of fire is calling
