[Intro: Big Boi and Gucci Mane]
Yeah! All the ladies say hoooo
All the hoes say (Hah! Hah! Hah!)
Gucci! Here we go, A-town, C-port
Cutmaster Swift down your throat, shawty

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Boy, stop, Sir Luscious Left Foot's on fire
Tryna block my shine just ain't gon' happen, so don't try
Every time I get on this microphone I like to spit
Inking hit up after hit, this penmanship is so legit
I came equipped like a prophylactic, now they riding dicks
Like styling on these suckas out here tryna buy their bitch
Now they rich, try convince everybody to trick off
But a true boss done paid the cost, she giving away them drawers
Word to the brown James, he some chicken chow mein
Really mane, you done say some silly things
And the fella Dana Dane, boy, you cuffed, claimed a dame
Hey, my main thang got my last name, know what I mean?

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm on my grind, shawty, don't block my shine, shawty
Hold up, hold up, guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up
I'm on my grind, shawty, don't block my shine, shawty
Wait a minute, wait a minute, chill a little, sit a minute
I can't close my safe no more 'cause I got too much money in it

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
They put Gucci in a cell then Madea went to jail
I make music, I make movies, I need Tyler Perry sales
Loud smell coming out the Lamb', fuck it, what the hell
Gucci Mane, so I'm Gucci'd down, she got on Chanel
In the cut rolling stupid kush like I'm in a rush
In the club with a half a pound, 150 blunts
Zone 6, East Atlanta's own, fuck with Nia Long
So I shine like it's showtime, all my jewelry on
On the block with my stupid watch, boy, you need to stop
When I stop, everybody watch, car don't have a top
In a stretch, cost a stupid check, roll another pack
And I'm gone, I can't even flick; Eastside, where you at?
Gucci!

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm on my grind, shawty, don't block my shine, shawty
Hold up, hold up, guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up
I'm on my grind, shawty, don't block my shine, shawty
Wait a minute, wait a minute, chill a little, sit a minute
I can't close my safe no more 'cause I got too much money in it

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Can't be trippin' 'bout no paper 'cause the safe is not so safe
The piggy bank got legs and feet and can get up and walk away, shawty
With my southern drawl, awkwardly I spray
Like the backside of a skunk and the stash house with the pump
Pistol grip in my lap at all times in the 'lac
From Atlanta to Savannah, can't a nigga stop that
Not when God's got his hands on me, only the strong survive
And the weak-minded are falling by the wayside, they try
But which I overcome and succeed, indeed
With success comes a great responsibility
We chose to lead not follow, it's a hard pill to swallow
Better get prescriptions filled 'cause there might not be tomorrow

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm on my grind, shawty, don't block my shine, shawty
Hold up, hold up, guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up
I'm on my grind, shawty, don't block my shine, shawty
Wait a minute, wait a minute, chill a little, sit a minute
I can't close my safe no more 'cause I got too much money in it
