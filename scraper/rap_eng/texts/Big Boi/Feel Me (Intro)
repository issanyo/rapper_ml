[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
When the lush hangs off the chrome
I know that you're gone, ya feel me (Feel me)
Fifteen years off in this game
Still nothin' changed, feel me (Feel me)
Ridin' swiftly through the night (Through the night)
And livin' this life, feel me (Feel me)
Whether I'm right or wrong (I'm right or wrong, I know, I know, I know, I know)
I know that you're gone, feel me (I know ya feel me)

[Interlude: Sleepy Brown]
Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, ohh (whoa whoa whoa)
(Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, wow)
Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, ohh (whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Do-do-do dooooo, do-do-do dooooo, wow)

[Outro: Big Boi]
