[Big Boi]
Sitting at the red light, I'm looking for my lighter
German heater by my leg, right
Don't want it to misfire cause I'm already high as a bird
(Purp, purp, purp, pu-purple ribbon)
Daddy Fat Sax bust on anything that's bumping
Chew you up, straight do you
Spit you out like you was bubble gum and concrete mixed in
Ready, get on your mark, set, let's go!
(What's that smell on your shirt?)
Boy, you already know

[Chorus]
What's that smell on your shirt?
(It's that purp, it's that purp!)
What's that smell on your shirt?
(It's that purp, it's that purp!)
When the police pull me over, they don't even wanna search
They only wanna know wha-what's that smell on your shirt!

What's that smell on your shirt?
(It's that purp, it's that purp!)
What's that smell on your shirt?
(It's that purp, it's that purp!)
See, I only burned a J, but now they swear I got that work
Calling backup, tryin' to act up cause they know we blow that purp!

[Verse 2]
I'm a young fly nigga
Authentic, check my tags
Drive an old-school Chevy droptop with the rag
And I'm so braggadocious where the wheel means swag
A couple thousand for the 'fit, oops, didn't mean to brag
Blowing purple smoke, they call me Puff the Magic Dragon
Nike SB Dunks, red monkeys now I'm bragging
Pulled up on this bitch
Talking reckless fashion bread
Looked at me, and I said

[Bridge x2]
Let's ride (let's ride), let's roll (let's roll)
Get high (get high), get low (get low)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Back in 9-5, all I had was 5 on it
Man, it's 2006, niggas smoking Michael Vicks
Not that Reggie, not that mid
All we smoke is president
(What's that smell on your shirt?)
Big Boi, autotuned the trick
Got that purp, got that purp
So you know I move that work
Blowing purple sticky icky out a Chevrolet 'vert
Police pull me to the right
All they smell is kryptonite
Roll the windows down
I don't wanna go to jail tonight

[Bridge x2]

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I keep that smell on my shirt
Move that presidential work
Keep that hand in my cup
Cigarillo full of purp
I don't hang around lames that be smoking on that dirt
And them mint grade suckers get they fucking feelings hurt
Police search, they won't find
None of my 'dro or my 9
I get low, I get high
Represent the Southside (Southside!)
Hit dimes, get high
Stay fly, I'm a dun
Roll it up in the VIP, throwing out a hundred ones

[Bridge x2]

[Chorus]
