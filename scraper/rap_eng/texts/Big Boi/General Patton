[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Get the South dick up out your mouth, what are you talmbout?
See we know everything that you're about, so try another route
Paperboy, you can't destroy what we done built
Pick on somebody your own size and fuck around, get killed
But not like the kilt above the knees, BB
Will plant you niggas like seeds, or fertilizer for the trees
Emergency vehicle last seen speeding from the scene
Nigga take one for the team, now he's bleeding from the spleen
Stay so fresh and oh so motherfucking clean
No blood spatter or evidence, long distance with a beam
We come in peace while some of ya'll niggas come in greed
Gluttons fucking up the game like ice, heroin, or speed
Slow down, nigga

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Speed it up like The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, boy go fast
Not a hobby, this my life, you disrespect it, that's your ass
As one half of the OutKast return like Ghost of Christmas Past
It's the son of Chico Dusty, must be West Savannah bad, ayy!
Had to go to church every Sunday with Great-Grandma and Granddad
Taught me always follow Jesus when the grass didn't have a path
If I ever fell astray, then God will get me back on track
Didn't say that Rico, Ray and Pat was getting with me and Three Stacks
Then we spitting 'cause we killing everything that we attack
Special Forces of the rap game, so you best take heed of that
All that shit you rappers lack, we got plenty, here's a snack
Don't ruin their appetite, because your shit is really wack
Wack-ass nigga

[Outro: Big Rube]
Another battle won, another story to tell
Listen to the angelic plucking of the puppet strings
As Sir Lucious puts his left foot forward
And rides off into the horizon of infinite regression, victorious
Undefeated on the battle field
Against the means of ignorance, greed, and hatred
All contenders to the throne are left naked
Because the truth is the only thing you can never be stripped of
And if you want to commit to that truth
Then you could end the vicious cycle that's affecting our youth today
If you just stop lying, if you just stop lying
Stop lying... lying

Hey, Josh, you everâ€“ you know about the David Blaine?
You know the magician David Blaine, right?
The David Blaine is when you're fucking a girl from the back, or somebody from the back, right, and goddamn
You let your friend slide in without her even knowing, right
Then you goddamn run around and bang on the window and you wave at her ass
It's called the David Blaine
