[Pre-Hook: Sarah Barthel]
I got my drum machine
I got my drum machine
I got my drum machine

[Bassline: Skrillex]

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Never scared Holmes, like a true player, runnin' out of end zone
Known to put dick in the friendzone, but only by request like a big song
Not my own, Antwan Andre Patton Senior, bitch what's happenin', I see ya
Man I see ya, man I see ya, man I see ya
In the rearview mirror I think we see this shit clearer
Ain't no crystal ball just balls on chins, dick all in your jaw amen
Thicker than a Snicker bar but slimmer than a Slim Jim
Then I tie her up Erica all we eatin' din din

[Pre-Hook: Sarah Barthel]
I got my drum machine
I got my drum machine
I got my drum machine
I got my drum machine
Three, two, one (turn up!)

[Hook]
Eight-Oh-Eight, Nine-Oh-Nine
S-P-Twelve, hit drum wild
Eight-Oh-Eight, Nine-Oh-Nine
S-P-Twelve, now what you talkin' 'bout?

[Post-Hook: Sarah Barthel]
Can you beat it like a drum tell me, tell me baby
Is it really what you want? Can you crank it louder
Till we wake the neighbours up, I make the perfect sounds
If you've got the magic touch, so you can turn me up

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
This be that Jedi rap shit and I'm your captain, come on my spacecraft to see what's happenin'
The bass they droppin' 808' straight jammin', disrespectfully but no manners
Keep heat like the flame below the mantle, freak beats and make examples
Assassinate every chant all the way from Atlanta, dick ride emcees and grab your saddles

[Refrain: Big Boi]
In the rearview mirror I might start to see it clearer
But the Eight-Oh-Eight is banging, I can't seem to fight the feeling
From my drum machine (now beat my drum)
I got my drum machine (now beat my drum)
I got my

But the Eight-Oh-Eight is banging, I can't seem to fight the feeling
From my drum machine

I got my drum machine (I beat my drum)
I got my drum machine (I beat my drum)
I got my drum machine (I beat my drum)
I got my drum machine (I beat my drum)
