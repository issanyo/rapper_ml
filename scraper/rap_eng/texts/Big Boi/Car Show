[Jagged Edge: Verse 1]

Rollup at the spot, I seen her had to meet her

I was at the bar, sippin' and I'm leanin'

I just, had to get attention, but didn't wanna mention

How, she just wasn't lookin'

And this ain't what I'm feelin'

Now, movin' on, to bout to have you later

And now, she's my girl, I knew that I wasn't playin' and its

Better than my friendship, it's kinda like my pension cause I'm savin' all

My funds up

And I'm gonna spend it long long long...


[Hook: repeat 2X]
She keep me spinnin' like the blades on my rims and

She keep me with it so I can't trade her in and

She keep me bumpin' up and down like a 6 - 4

She keep my engine runnin' hot like a car show


[Verse 2]

She's my movie star and I'm her director

Sweat, in the car, driving as fast as we can go

She could be all on me, kissin' me touching me

I don't wanna stop right now, she don't wanna stop neither
She's a sexy girl, shaped like a coke bottle

Or a fancy car the prototype model

She got cars in all around spots, keep my engine runnin' hot

I don't wanna slow it down, I'mma let her go...

[Big Boi from OutKast]

Now get my damn trophy

The way she movin' like chest and checker

Black white any color gotta respect her

Double decker flat yea body gotta protect her

Together weather the storm to things get better, never

Fall to the waist, I grace, I cry

Lifeless, lemme add some color to that shine

I like this, bittin', fuckin', all of this for nothing

Shoulda gotten an old shit or somethin'

Some old fools bubblin' and that's what we becomin'

See, you used to be comin', when the engine was runnin'

Now ??? and you ain't that woman

Mmm, damn, I hate that frontin'

I hate just bumpin' in just case you was wondering

Most wantin' a million and how you wantin' a hundred

I done done it, I done done it, I done done it, ho, I done done it


[Jagged Edge: Hook 2X]

Up and down like a 6 - 4, party bumpin' hot dro

Droppin' tops and way more, hot like car show

Y'all know how we do, keep it true no see through

Now I gotta roll it and and we bout to roll (out out out)


She keep me spinnin' like them blades on my rims man

She keep me with it so I can't trade her in man

She keep it bumpin up and down like a 6 - 4

She keep my engine runnin' hot like a car show
