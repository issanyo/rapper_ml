[Verse 1]
Do you remember what you said to me the day I met you?
Like yesterday, I still can hear your voice, you promised to be
Still in my life no matter what you had to do to be there
Well, it's been a while and here we are looking back on times that we've shared

[Pre-Chorus]
I still imagine us being young and so in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Feels like it's always just been us

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around (Still around, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I still believe in all the things you said to me in those days
You gave me love and kept your word with every promise you made
I sing your favorite song inside my head when you're not with me
Until you come back home and take me in your arms and hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
I still imagine us being young and still in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Makes me smile, we're still in love

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around

[Verse 3]
Looking back through all the years
You remember the first time I went to your house?
And your father looked at me like I had three heads?
I'll never forget the day
We were so in love
Looking back through all the years
You were so beautiful and so young
I never will forget the day you came into my life and what you said to me
I can't believe you're still mine, that's crazy
I love you

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me (We were in the park, holding hands)
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever (Never let you down, my baby)
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around (Still around, yeah)
I remember we were in the park (Ooh)
Holding hands and you said to me (Ooh)
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl and
You would stay with me forever (Ooh)
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around (Still around, yeah)
