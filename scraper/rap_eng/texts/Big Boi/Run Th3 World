(Intro)
Eventually it's gon find you (find you)
Eventually it's gon find you (find you)
Eventually it's gon find you (find you)

This world keeps going round
There's no love to be found
How can you
How can you
How can you
How can you
Sit there let the children

What about the people that’s barefoot with no shoes feeling better when the sun come up?
81% it’s the 99 say what you gon do for us
We’ll run up in yo house like the first runner up and be the first one to bunk
And the last one to get laid down, stay down
And now we’re looking at the top of the pile
On the king of the mountain, go knock him off
We vote but yall niggas just too soft
Bubble gum, just poppin off
And a mouth like the nigga got all the hoes
Got all the dope and all the women
Boy what you gonna do in the penitentiary
Got a lot of money, can’t take it with me
I can’t take it with me
I wish they could send me to the moon and back
With the cure for cancer
And save the lives of my great grandma and my great granddad, now that’s the answer
To the question but they make money off the medicine
Leaving us all stuck in elections
With no progression, just recession

Shoes for running and I’ll race ya
Sun is coming, it’ll chase ya
Through this deadbeat town
Through this deadbeat town

The end is coming, I would race ya
But there’s no running, it’ll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down

This world keeps going round
Oh yes, there’s no love to be found
This world keeps going round
Oh yes, there’s no love to be found
How can you? How can you?
How can you? How can you?
Sit there and let good people die?

Just as I expected, life gets deadly
It’s funny how the beloved become the beheaded
The truth can be independent of direction that you stretch it
So my niggas we’ll draw when shit gets sketchy
It’s a masterpiece, a work of art
A gallery, no photoshop
Pictures say a million words so I just let my photos talk
Even in yo local town
Niggas say you know he boss
Every time my name is brought up better know it’s mobile talk
That’s why she get me geek’d til her shins weak
I’m blazing everyday, you can call dem we
You’re running from a life that you didn’t see
That’s like playing hide and seek with that grim reaper

Shoes for running and I’ll race ya
Sun is coming, it’ll chase ya
Through this deadbeat town
Through this deadbeat town

The end is coming, I would race ya
But there’s no running, it’ll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down

(x2)
You can fight and try to get away
But there’s nowhere to run and hide to
You’d better know that there will come a day
Eventually it’s gon find you

Eventually it’s gon find you, find you
Eventually it’s gon find you
And it’s gon…
Yea eventually it’s gon find you
And it’s gon find you eh, it’s gon find you
Yeah

This world keeps going round
Oh yes, there’s no love to be found
This world keeps going round
Oh yes, there’s no love to be found
How can you? How can you?
How can you? How can you?
Sit there and let good people die?
