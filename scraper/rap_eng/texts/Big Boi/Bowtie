[Intro: Sleepy Brown (Big Boi)]
Girl you cut up (Lucius Left Foot)
Girl you know you cut up

[Hook: Sleepy Brown & Jazze Pha]
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Nasty Noompsy Knightingale, fresh in that tuxedo
Cummerbund with no suspenders, my torpedo, you libido
Need to chat (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
I'm your r-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys
To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this
Smack on smack on some of this Dick Tracy
Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
Whatcha mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where I

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Oh, lord, how can it be so hard?
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack
As we strut, skip the line through the glass window, glance
We look fine, right on time as we step in the place
The nursery's crunk, we've come to play

[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown]
Everybody's watching cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling, oh so wicked across that floor
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me
Throw your hands up if you feel me
'Cause we well designed, like the finest wine
Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why
I got the ladies in line, because they can't deny
So raise your hands to the sky, 'cause we super fly
