[Intro: BlocBoy JB]
Hah, word

Hey (hah), hey (yeah)

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Bitch, I ain't with none of that shit (none of that)
Bitch, I ain't with none of that shit (none of that)
Bitch, I ain't with none of that shit (word)
Bitch, I ain't with none of that shit (none of that)
The chopper turn you to a runnin' back bitch (grrah)
Bitch fuck your clique and go run with that bitch (doon doon doon)
I fucked your bitch and you sprung off that bitch (word)
You ran on my clique and I sprung on that bitch (that's on my mama)
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Ho, better not say no more (what)
Bitch, get me some 'gars from the store (go)
You did the set, cool, say no more (no)
I lay you down like a welcome mat ho (word)
Congratulations, you're welcome, you ho (ho)
In the air like a UFO (in the air)
I'm pulling cards like it's Yu-Gi-Oh
How you a gangster on cruise control? (word)
Talking 'bout guns, I got two of those (two)
Bless him like somebody blew a nose
I clean shit up like it's poop control (poop control)
Hundred drum up his nose (whoa)
Keep a pole, more paper than a pour
Say he want beef, it's a go
Lock and load, let's go to they hood and post (doon doon doon)
Where they at, let me just find out
All I need is a hideout (word)
I'ma pull up in some drive out

[Verse 1: BlocBoy JB]
Skrrt skrrt, it's a race (ayy it's a race)
I can't hit your blunt 'cause it might just be laced (might be laced, huh)
And I can't fuck your bitch unless I get some face, huh (I get some face, huh)
I hate a worrisome ass ho askin' for favors (what?)
I be smokin' on loud, just woke up the neighbors (gas)
I'm in your house like I do your cable (cable)
Snitched on your man, boy you is a traitor (word)
Slam a nigga like dominoes on a table
Sunday we pray for C, not for savior (huh?)
DOA, that's first degree, can't save you (murder)
I'm totin' shit like I'm Mater (Mater) 2017, made The Fader (Fader)
Ballin' on niggas like Lakers (Lakers), I call up Ben for a fade up (later)
Chopper will spin you around, 360, we gettin' these waves up (spin around, spin around)
She didn't want you so you raped her (raped her)
Call you a plate 'cause you ate her (you ate her)
Fuck a fourth of the lean, pour an eight up (word)
She give me head 'til she get her lil grades up

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Bitch, I ain't with none of that shit (none of that)
Bitch, I ain't with none of that shit (none of that)

We been had your wife, man, we don't want your bitch (ooh)

And I got a bad bitch sniffin' on coke (huh?)
Could've bought a house but I went and bought a boat (boat)
