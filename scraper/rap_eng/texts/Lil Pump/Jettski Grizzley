[Intro: Lil Pump]
Ooh, Eskeetit!
Helluva made this beat, baby
Ooh, Eskeetit!

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Lil Pump]
Slide down my block we gon' shoot, we gon' shoot (oouu) (we gon' shoot)
Lil' baby a thot, but she cute, but she cute (yeah, cold)
I just want the top then you through, then you through (oouu, done)
Niggas say they gettin' guap, where the proof, where the proof? (where it's at? huh)
Slide down my block we gon' shoot, we gon' shoot (brra, brr)
Lil' baby a thot, but she cute, but she cute (yeah, cold)
I just want the top then you through, then you through (oouu)
Niggas say they gettin' guap, where the proof, where the proof? (where it's at? Eskeetit!)

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley & Lil Pump]
If I catch an opp in traffic he gon catch the K
Hope he know that when I shoot I'm tryna catch his face (yeah)
Called my plug like, "What bag I'm 'bout to catch today?" (oouu)
I got 200 on that Rolls, you can't catch the Wraith (Eskeetit!)
I'm in love with my bitch ass cheeks (oouu)
Told that hoe my lap was her assigned seat (yeah)
He gon' choke her out if he found out I had her chokin' (wow)
And my watch mil', you will drown, my AP the ocean (oouu)

[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
Eskeetit!
Bitch don't call me Pump my name Jetski (Jetski)
Million dollars cash, just layin' in the bedsheets (oouu)
All your jewelry fake, boy, that shit don't impress me (nope)
Got a AP, sip lean, don't drink Henny (yeah, oouu)
Tag team a bitch pass her to the bro (oouu, yeah)
Ex-bitch a hoe, had to let her go (let her go)
Had her suck my dick for a line of coke (oouu)
Spent 20 thousand on a rain coat (chyeah, huh)

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Lil Pump]
Slide down my block we gon' shoot, we gon' shoot (oouu) (we gon' shoot)
Lil' baby a thot, but she cute, but she cute (yeah, cold)
I just want the top then you through, then you through (oouu, done)
Niggas say they gettin' guap, where the proof, where the proof? (where it's at? huh)
Slide down my block we gon' shoot, we gon' shoot (brra, brr)
Lil' baby a thot, but she cute, but she cute (yeah, cold)
I just want the top then you through, then you through (oouu)
Niggas say they gettin' guap, where the proof, where the proof? (where it's at? Eskeetit!)

[Verse 3: Lil Pump & Tee Grizzley]
She looked at my wrist, she had a heart attack (water)
Bitch you in ya house, shakin' shit just like a runnin' back
Gave your bitch good dick, had her doing jumpin' jacks
2 mill, 8 mill, man I want it all cash (yeah, all cash, oouu)
20 on my gucci fit (oouu)
Yeah I got a thick bitch (yeah), all you niggas counterfeit (huh)
Spanish hoe she with the shits (oouu), I put 10 bricks on a Lyft (ten)
Too much hoes I cannot pick (oouu), don't know which one I should hit (yeah, oouu)

[Verse 4: Tee Grizzley]
I might fly the jet to Waikiki (G5)
3500 for the sweater 'cause it's GG (Gucci!)
Hit her in the shower, made that lil bitch do the mini me
Me and Jetski drippin' on a bitch, neck on Fiji (water)
Watch really hittin', ain't no funny camera tricks (ain't no apps)
Gettin' chewed up by my lil' hispanic bitch (como estas)
No you can't spend the night, don't bring your pajamas bitch
And whoever don't like it suck a dick with extra spit, bitch (Booah)

[Chorus: Tee Grizzley & Lil Pump]
Slide down my block we gon' shoot, we gon' shoot (oouu)
Lil' baby a thot, but she cute, but she cute (yeah, cold)
I just want the top then you through, then you through (oouu, done)
Niggas say they gettin' guap, where the proof, where the proof? (where it's at? huh)
Slide down my block we gon' shoot, we gon' shoot (brra, brr)
Lil' baby a thot, but she cute, but she cute (yeah, cold)
I just want the top then you through, then you through (oouu)
Niggas say they gettin' guap, where the proof, where the proof? (where it's at? Eskeetit!)
