[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Bring ten bitches to the back
Whippin' up Whitney, boy how you do that, ooh
Bring ten bitches to the back
Whippin' up Whitney, boy how you do that, ooh
Whippin' up Whitney, Whippin' up Whitney, Lil Pump how you do that? Ooh
Whippin' up Whitney, Whippin' up Whitney, Lil Pump how you do that? Ooh
Damn, I went and flexed like this
Diamonds so yellow it look like piss, ooh
I can't wife no bitch, spent a couple racks up on my wrist, ooh
I can't wife no thot, damn, bitch I'm sippin' Wok, damn
And I'm off this xan, damn, this will never stop, damn

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Hop in a foreign and step on it
Sippin' on good drank, and I got a loaf on
Cops pull me over right now they gon' lock me up
'Cause I got all this smoke on me
And I'm so mothafuckin' inked
Lookin' like the tattoo man just wrote on me
In the all white P1 lookin' like I got a whole bunch of coke on me
Slide down, ride down, I'm the king, bow down
One day smoke a half pound, milkin' up, cash cow
I'm very important, me and my gang don't do pat downs
I bet I fucked yo' bitch, told foenem put the racks out
You know me and gang goin' for the slide
The shit we on finna fly
Yo bitch pointin' up to the sky
She know I got them mob ties
Hammer ridin' 'round with the grass
Hammer ridin' 'round with the cash
Shooters on your ass, ASAP

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Bring ten bitches to the back
Whippin' up Whitney, boy how you do that, ooh
Bring ten bitches to the back
Whippin' up Whitney, boy how you do that, ooh
Whippin' up Whitney, Whippin' up Whitney, Lil Pump how you do that? Ooh
Whippin' up Whitney, Whippin' up Whitney, Lil Pump how you do that? Ooh
Damn, I went and flexed like this
Diamonds so yellow it look like piss, ooh
I can't wife no bitch, spent a couple racks up on my wrist, ooh
I can't wife no thot, damn, bitch I'm sippin' Wok, damn
And I'm off this xan, damn, this will never stop, damn
