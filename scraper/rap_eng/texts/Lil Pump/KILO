[Verse 1: Smokepurpp]
My neck worth a brick, I put that on my gang
Boy you ain't gang, but you probably a stain
You niggas want features, you niggas is lame
I need me some change, I need me your chain
My neck worth a kilo, I feel like Sub-Zero
My bitches is emo, my shirt weighs a kilo

[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
Finessin' the rest and I don't got a deal
I'm poofing the gas and I puff for the pill
I call up Smokepurpp and we go do a drill
I'm getting the money you know it's too real
My neck worth a brick and my neck worth a kilo
I be with Cortez and I call up my people
I finesse all the money, they think I'm a hero
My neck worth a kilo, my neck worth a kilo

[Chorus: Smokepurpp]
My neck worth a kilo, my neck worth a kilo
My neck worth a kilo, my neck worth a kilo
My neck worth a kilo, my neck worth a kilo
My neck worth a kilo, my neck worth a kilo
