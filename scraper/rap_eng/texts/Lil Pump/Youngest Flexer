I just bought 3 thousand dollar Gucci pants (Gucci pants)
I just left the trap, and I'm off the Xans (and I'm off the Xans)

Put a Xan in smoothie, I don't watch no movies (I don't)

Forty diamond chains, sixty bricks, I make it rain (huh)
And I'm eating Wingstop, posted in the trap (in the trap, what?)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Somebody please tell me where my money machine at
My money dirty, I'm tryna think of ways I can clean that
I spent at least 3 million dollars just on the pieces
These haters think they can keep up, man, they can't believe it
Gucci got a six-pack, they can't believe it
But hey, lil bitch, here's three stacks, let's have a threesome
I wanna own it outright, don't wanna lease it
He wanna be Guwop so bad that he talkin' greasy
She wanna be with Wop so bad that she fuck the DJ
That bitch should prolly' ride a bicycle on the freeway
Three years ago, I stacked my paper the long way
Now I'm stacking million dollar checks up the grown way
