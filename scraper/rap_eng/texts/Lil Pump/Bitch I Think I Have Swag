[Chorus: Based King]
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag
Bitch I think I got swag; Louis shirt, tied pants
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag
Bitch I think I got swag; Louis shirt, tied pants
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag

[Verse 1: Lil Pump]
Eleven-year-old rapper, on them sold-my-soul bitches
Got all these jits hatin', cause I'm ballin', no bitches
I started it up, so I put the gas into ignition
Licked your girl for a month with no permission
The best eleven-year-old rapper, I write my own lyrics
I [?] rappers, their careers are finished
...

[Chorus: Based King]
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag
Bitch I think I got swag; Louis shirt, tied pants
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag
Bitch I think I got swag; Louis shirt, tied pants
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag
Bitch I think I got swag, bitch I think I got swag

[Verse 2: Based King]
75 years, so you know that I'm thuggin'
...

[Chorus: Based King]
Bitch I think I made swag, bitch I think I made swag
Bitch I think I made swag; Louis shirt, tiny pants
Bitch I think I made swag, bitch I think I made swag
Bitch I think I made swag, bitch I think I made swag
Bitch I think I made swag, bitch I think I made swag
Bitch I think I made swag; Louis shirt, tiny pants
Bitch I think I made swag, bitch I think I made swag
Bitch I think I made swag, bitch I think I made swag

[Outro: Based King]
Bitches on my fuckin' dick, what
