[Intro: Lil Pump & Reporter]
Hey wassup Pump, how you doin' man? What-
Esskeetit
What happened, man?
Ayy man, we got rich lawyers (laughs)
We got real lawyers
The best lawyers in the planet
It was reported to the police that, uh, shooters (Eshkeetit!) fired into your house, (ayy listen) is that-is that your memory of what happened?
Listen, hold up
See my ankle?

[Chorus: Lil Pump & Reporter]
House arrest, house arrest, house arrest, house arrest (house arrest?)
Pop two Xans, and I-
Pop two Xans and I passed the test
"Gucci Gang" tatted on my fuckin' chest!

[Outro: Reporter]
