Ayy, nigga, I'm at yo crib with a ski (Ski! Ski!)
Yuh, niggas know I'ma ball just like the Heat
Rick Owens, Margielas on my feet
I got that 'preme, pussy nigga I got that heat

[Verse 1]
Pull up on your block I'm banging off that nina
I feel like John Cena, all my diamonds Aquafina
223s call me lil rat I need that cheese
My bitch got double d's damn I'm moving hella P's
I can't fuck your bitch, I know that pussy stank
Young nigga sippin' on drank, all my Grabbas filled with stank
Bad bitch sniffin' on that coke
I heard he got the pack, I'm taking all the dope
Pull up on your block I'm switchin' lanes
All my niggas bang, lil nigga you a stain
I'm takin' all your shit, yuh, I'm kicking in that door
I need them fuckin' racks, bitch get on the fuckin' floor

[Bridge]
Pull up at your crib with a ski mask
Pull up at your crib with a ski mask
Yeah, I'm at your crib with a ski mask
Pull up at your crib with a ski mask

[Hook]
Ayy, nigga, I'm at yo crib with a ski (Ski! Ski!)
Yuh, niggas know imma' ball just like the heat
Rick Owens, Margielas on my feet
I got that 'preme, pussy nigga I got that heat

[Verse 2]
Keep that 30 right there by my waist
My nigga, all my niggas will shoot you in your face
All my niggas got lawyers, we beat that case
And I keep that K right by my waist

[Bridge]
Pull up at your crib with a ski mask
Pull up at your crib with a ski mask
Yeah, I'm at your crib with a ski mask
Pull up at your crib with a ski mask
