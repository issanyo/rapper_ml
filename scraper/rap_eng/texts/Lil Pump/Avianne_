Ooh!
Lil Purpp bless yo trap
Huh? Ooh!

[Hook: Smokepurrp]
Thirty bands on me, ooh
Fuck a lil bitch, while she ride my like a pony
Young nigga trappin', and I'm shootin' like Gin√≥bili
And a g wack, got bands like maloney
Damn, I can't lie, ooh
Hit Avianne, spend some bands on ice
Damn, I can't lie, ooh
Hit Avianne, spend some bands on ice

[Verse 1: Smokepurrp]
Hit Avianne, spend a quarter on ice
Now I'm tatted on my face, young nigga can't pipe down
Three chains on me and they all full of ice now
Bite down, geekin' on the molly, can't bite down
