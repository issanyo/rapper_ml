Ouu, ayy
Pinkie ring froze, pinkie ring froze
Pinkie ring covered in gold
Too much diamonds on my neck, think I might choke
Had a threesome with your bitch with my eyes closed
Tell my side hoe bring it through the back door, oh!
I got eighty-thousand in my envelope, ouu
I just got a "Gucci Gang" medal though
Damn, I got some homies that went federal, ouu
Look at my two-tone Patek
I smash a hoe then forget
I got a fridge on my neck
I'm smokin' gas on a jet
Ouu, I love to flex
Ouu, blew out two million that Tootsie's, ayy
I made your auntie a groupie, ouu
And you know my life a movie, ayy
I got sticks like Call of Duty, ouu
