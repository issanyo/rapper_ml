[Intro]
Fiji water
Ay, pass me the Percs
Ay, pass me the Xans
Ay, Lil Pump, you got Fiji
Where lean at, where lean at
Hell yeah, I got Fiji
Dumb ass bitch, fuck wrong witchu
Where the Fiji at

[Chorus]
I pour Fiji on her neck
I pour Fiji on her neck
I pour Fiji on her neck
I pour Fiji on her neck
Fiji (what)
Fiji (Fiji), Fiji (what)
Fiji (Fiji), Fiji (what)
Fiji (water)
Fiji (Fiji) Fiji (what)

[Verse]
I got Fiji on my neck, I got Gucci on my chest
And my grandma sippin' Tech
Off a Xan like Ron Artest
Slice your auntie in the neck
Lil Pump, disrespect
Run up on you with that 40
Grab your grandma by the neck
(Fiji, Gucci)

[Chorus]
I pour Fiji on her neck
I pour Fiji on her neck
I pour Fiji on her neck
I pour Fiji on her neck
Fiji (what)
Fiji (Fiji), Fiji (what)
Fiji (Fiji), Fiji (what)
Fiji (water)
Fiji (Fiji) Fiji (what)
