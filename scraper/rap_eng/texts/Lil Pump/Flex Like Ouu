[Intro]
Ouu, ouu
Lil Pump
Ayy, ayy, ayy
(Oh my God, Ronny)

[Chorus]
Move them bricks to the bando like ouu
Move them bricks to the bando like ouu
Diamond on my wrist and it look like glue
Diamond on my wrist and it look like glue
Walk in the club and I flex like ouu
Walk in the club and I flex like ouu
Maison Margiela all over my shoe
Maison Margiela all over my shoe
Pull up swerving in a coupe
Pull up swerving in a coupe
Pull up swerving in a coupe
Pull up swerving in a coupe
Move them bricks to the bando like ouu
Diamond on my wrist and it look like glue
Walk in the club and I flex like ouu
Maison Margiela all over my shoe

[Verse]
Made a couple bands in the kitchen (Kitchen)
Made a couple bands water whippin' (Brrr)
Take a nigga bitch, go missing, ouu
Bitch, I ball like a piston, ouu
Bitch, I flex, Ric Flair, damn
All they do is stare, ouu
Lil Pump really don't care, no
Told a bih "Lil Pump, yeah, ouu"
Everybody know I'm up next, yeah
Everybody know I flex, ouu
I run through these checks, ouu
I flex on my ex, ouu
Left four bands in the trap (Trap)
Left four bands in the trap (four)
Smokin' on loud pack, ouu
Smokin' on loud pack, ouu

[Chorus]
Move them bricks to the bando like, ouu
Move them bricks to the bando like, ouu
Diamond on my wrist and it look like glue
Diamond on my wrist and it look like glue
Walk in the club and I flex like ouu
Walk in the club and I flex like ouu
Maison Margiela all over my shoe
Maison Margiela all over my shoe
Pull up swerving in a coupe
Pull up swerving in a coupe
Pull up swerving in a coupe
Pull up swerving in a coupe
Move them bricks to the bando like, ouu
Diamond on my wrist and it look like glue
Walk in the club and I flex like, ouu
Maison Margiela all over my shoe
