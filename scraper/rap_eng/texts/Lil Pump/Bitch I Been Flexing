[Intro: Lil Pump & FendiFurCoat]
Grraah!

Grraah, grraah, grraah

Grraah, grraah, grraah, skrrt (skrrt)
I done just hopped out my coupe (skrrt)
I done just hopped out my coupe

Filthy Rich Beats

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Ayy, I done just hopped out my coupe
Ayy, I done just hopped out my coupe
Ayy, I done just hopped out my coupe
Ayy, I done just hopped out my coupe
Ayy, I done just hopped out my coupe
Ayy, I done just end up on news
Ayy, I done just end up on news
Ayy, I done just end up on news
Ayy, I done just hopped out my coupe
Ayy, I done just hit me a lick
Ayy, I done just flip me a brick
Ayy, I done just got me a Glock
Ayy, I just done bought me some hit

[Verse 1: Lil Pump & FendiFurCoat]
Got a .40 where the holler tips (pew)
Got a .30 where my letter is (brr)
I don't give a fuck, I'm with this shit (boom)
I pull up on your block and hit with stick (boom, boom, boom)
Lil Pump, yeah he sellin' rock (Filthy Rich Beats)
Posted on the block, with my fuckin' ma
Hit you with the Glock, yeah I'm bustin' shots
Yeah I'm servin' white, yeah I'm servin' frost (grraah)
Posted on the block; run up on me wrong, and you gettin' dropped
Got a .40 with me (wow) and I got the Glock
Run up on me wrong, boy you gettin' Paul (braow)
Esskeetit!

[Verse 2: FendiFurCoat]
Bitch, I been flexin' since the seventh fuckin' grade
Let a nigga run up on me, get his momma at a grape
Flexing so hard got me, got Supreme up on my chest
Bitch, flexing so hard, making all these thots wet
Niggas ask me why I rap, bitch cause I can
Talkin' all this shit for what, nigga? You was just a fan
Took your thot, finesse for top, pussy weak
Got that bitch on my dick for a goddamn week, yeah, yeah, yeah (brrah, brrah, brrah!)
Bust on in her mouth, kicked that fuckin' thot out (bye!)
Copped the pints, get them for the high, yeah
All this dope got in my eyes
Like a Chinaman's wife when he says he's outta rice
In the kitchen whippin' up a pint...

Hit my trap, ain't endorse
Drugged a bitch, for her corpse
Sippin' lean, smokin' thrice...

[Outro: FendiFurCoat]
Yeah, esskeetit man
