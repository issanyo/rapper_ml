[Intro: Lil Pump]
Ayy, ayy
Ayy, got the trap jumpin'
Ouu, ayy, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Pump & Juicy J]
Got the trap jumpin', got the trap jumpin'
Got the trap jumpin', got the trap jumpin'
Got the trap jumpin', got the trap jumpin'
Got the trap jumpin', got the trap jumpin'
Made one phone call, got the trap jumpin'
Made two phone calls, got the trap jumpin'
Made three phone calls, got the trap jumpin'
Made four phone calls, got the trap jumpin'
Trap goin' stupid, trap goin' stupid
Trap goin' stupid, trap goin' stupid
Goddamn, ooh, trap goin' stupid
Trap goin' stupid, trap goin' stupid
Yuh, ayy, trap goin' stupid
Trap goin' stupid, trap goin' stupid
Yuh (yeah), trap goin' stupid (yeah)
Trap goin' stupid (yeah), trap goin' stupid
(Let's get it)

[Verse: Juicy J]
Yeah, I count my own money, yeah
I ain't ever been no dummy (no dummy)
Movin' them Ps, let me be, that shit sweet like honey (shit sweet)
Yeah, trap goin' stupid, don't be foolish
Don't try to stay at home, I do this (don't do it)
Whole bread, I got new shit (new shit)
My wrist cost me two whips (cash)
I ain't ever been no fool (no fool)
Always fed my crew (my niggas)
I'm from the jungle
Them wolves don't eat, then they might turn on you (we eat)
Nigga, I paid my dues (dues), nigga can't clock my moves (uh-uh)
It look like a Bar Mitzvah on my neck, I'm rockin' so many jewels
Made one phone call, now I gotta load in
Twenty-four hours, trap still open
How you gettin' money all day if you're closin'?
Kick all the good girls out, let the hoes in
Damn, ooh, this what I do
I can teach you some shit you can't learn in school
Drop it in the pot, let it steam, let it brew
Same old Juice, it ain't nuttin' new, I just

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Got the trap jumpin', got the trap jumpin'
Got the trap jumpin', got the trap jumpin'
Got the trap jumpin', got the trap jumpin'
Got the trap jumpin', got the trap jumpin'
Made one phone call, got the trap jumpin'
Made two phone calls, got the trap jumpin'
Made three phone calls, got the trap jumpin'
Made four phone calls, got the trap jumpin'
Trap goin' stupid, trap goin' stupid
Trap goin' stupid, trap goin' stupid
Goddamn, ooh, trap goin' stupid
Trap goin' stupid, trap goin' stupid
Yuh, ayy, trap goin' stupid
Trap goin' stupid, trap goin' stupid
Yuh, trap goin' stupid
Trap goin' stupid, trap goin' stupid
