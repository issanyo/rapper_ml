Lil Pump
Ayy, ayy, ayy, chyeah

Esskeetit

[Chorus]
Look at my neck shine (ice)
Look at my wrist shine, chyeah (ooh)
My diamonds might make you blind, chyeah (ooh, chyeah)
Let 'em in five at a time, ooh (brr)
I just be smokin' on dope, chyeah
All of my diamonds on froze, ooh (brr, brr)
Louis down head to my toe, chyeah
I just might buy the store, uh, chyeah (oh)
Look at my neck shine, chyeah (ice)
Look at my wrist shine, chyeah
Fuck a bitch two times, chyeah
Pussy was too fire, ooh (brr)
No, I cannot lie, ooh
Look at my neck shine, chyeah, chyeah
Look at my wrist shine (brr)
I think I got too high, ooh

[Verse 1]
Look at my neck shine
Gucci goggles on so I got four eyes, yeah
Smokin' on gelato, yeah I got it from Dubai
Fendi on, bitch, Louis all on bowtie
Fuck five hoes in a day, yeah, I can't lie
Smash her and her sister at the same time
Tell her bust it open, gotta do it on FaceTime
Fuck a nine to five, I eat the booty in the daytime, ooh
Look at my wrist, like, "Ooh, damn"
She suck my dick off the Instagram (uh)
Cold, so you know who I am, chyeah
Left wrist cost a hunnid bands, ooh
Pop a bean, now her brain open
Right wrist so wet it look like the ocean
When your girl gave me top, told her I had to focus
Lil Pump saved the rap game like a poet, woah
(Esskeetit)

[Chorus]
Look at my neck shine (ice)
Look at my wrist shine, chyeah (ooh)
My diamonds might make you blind, chyeah
Let 'em in five at a time, ooh
I just be smokin' on dope, chyeah
All of my diamonds on froze, ooh (brr, Lil Pump)
Louis down head to my toe, chyeah
I just might buy the store, chyeah
Look at my neck shine, chyeah (ice)
Look at my wrist shine, chyeah
Fuck a bitch two times, chyeah
Pussy was too fire, ooh (brr)
No, I cannot lie, ooh
Look at my neck shine, chyeah
Look at my wrist shine (brr)
I think I got too high (Lil Pump)

[Verse 2]
Drop top coupe when I ride around
Playin' Lil Pump and your ass catch a hunnid rounds
Can't pull up to the weed shop, you ain't got a pound
Take a look, I bust down like wow, ow
Come in the city, I bank out now
And my neck worth like two hunnid thou'
And they just mad 'cause I made my own sound (ooh)
Jump off the roof and my fans goin' wild
(Esskeetit)

[Chorus]
Look at my neck shine (ice)
Look at my wrist shine, chyeah (ooh)
My diamonds might make you blind, chyeah (chyeah)
Let 'em in five at a time, ooh
I just be smoking on dope, chyeah
All of my diamonds on froze, ooh (brr, Lil Pump)
Louis down head to my toe, chyeah
I just might buy the store, chyeah
Look at my neck shine, chyeah (ice)
Look at my wrist shine, chyeah
Fuck a bitch two times, chyeah
Pussy was too fire, ooh (brr)
No, I cannot lie, ooh
Look at my neck shine, chyeah
Look at my wrist shine (brr)
I think I got too high
