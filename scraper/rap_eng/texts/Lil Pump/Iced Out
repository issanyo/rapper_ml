Iced out chain, iced out ring
Yeah, I feel like Gucci Mane, diamonds Aquafina, rain
I could pay your bitch a trip, Maseratis at the crib
She just love the way I drip, only wear designer kicks
Ayy, ayy, iced out chain, I'm a walkin' Brinks truck
Keep my thang tucked, if I bust you better stay ducked
Dropped out 9th grade, dropped out straight to the Milwaukee Bucks
Could've been at Harvard servin' juugs, but I don't give a fuck
