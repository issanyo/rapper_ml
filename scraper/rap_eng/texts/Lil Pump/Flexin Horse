[Intro]
Ayy, Lil Water
Drive that bitch by the elbow
Gang

[Chorus]
Okay
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, lil' pump, lil' pump
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, I slap her in her neck
Okay
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, lil' pump, lil' pump
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, I slap her in her neck
Okay

[Verse]
Lil Pump a flexin' horse, flexin' horse, flexin' horse
Bitch, I got blue hair and I'm looking like a Avatar (I am)
My lil' pack smell like fish, take my bags that filled with dumb stank
I can't fuck with you, cause I know that all you niggas stains
My grandma sellin' lil' pack, and she sellin' cocaine
She'll run up on your block and she'll shoot you in the fucking brain
I was always known as the nigga that was sellin' crack
Now I'm at the top with your momma posting in the trap (with your momma)

[Chorus]
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, lil' pump, lil' pump (okay)
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, I slap her in her neck (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Okay
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, lil' pump, lil' pump (pew pew, pew, gang)
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, I slap her in her neck (brr, brr, brr, brr)
