[Intro]
Ooh, Big Head on the beat
Lil Pump
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
This is CB's beats

[Chorus]
I be, I be drippin' head to toe
Everywhere I fuckin' go
I drop forty racks a show
I could go flex on your hoe
I got junkies at the door, I got junkies at the door
I got junkies at the door, I got junkies at the door
I be drippin' head to toe
Everywhere I fuckin' go
I drop forty racks a show
I could go flex on your hoe
I got junkies at the door, I got junkies at the door
I got junkies at the door, I got junkies at the door

[Verse]
I got junkies at the door
I could serve you 2 for 4
I could serve you couple Xans
I could feed your bitch some coke
Yeah, my Uzi automatic, make your grandma do a backflip
Yeah, that .45 do that magic
Yeah, my wrist do that gymnastics
Got a bust down on my wrist
It look like I took a piss
So you cannot tell me shit
Make your auntie do a flip
Yeah, I'm drinkin' Molly water
While I'm fuckin' on your daughter
Bitch, I'm bustin' at your father
Call me Lil Pump Vince Carter

[Chorus]
I be, I be drippin' head to toe
Everywhere I fuckin' go
I drop forty racks a show
I could go flex on your hoe
I got junkies at the door, I got junkies at the door
I got junkies at the door, I got junkies at the door
I be drippin' head to toe
Everywhere I fuckin' go
I drop forty racks a show
I could go flex on your hoe
I got junkies at the door, I got junkies at the door
I got junkies at the door, I got junkies at the door

[Outro]
I be drip, I be drip, I be drip
I be, I be drippin' head to toe
Everywhere I fuckin' go
I drop forty racks a show
I could go flex on your hoe
I got junkies at the door, I got junkies at the door
I got junkies at the door, I got junkies at the door
