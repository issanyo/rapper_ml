[Intro]
Oh my god, Ronny
Ayy

[Chorus]
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I'm on a whole 'nother level (yeah, yeah)
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I'm on a whole 'nother level (ooh)
They try to copy my speed
They try to copy the spot
Drippin', drippin' like a faucet (grrrrr)
Drop, hoochie on my knees
Yeah, bad bitch on my knees
Drop, skinny dippin' with your bitch
Damn, I'm chokin' on my Trix

[Verse 1: Ronny J]
That's why I buy what I want
That's why I stay where I want
Now I count racks for the fuck of it
Niggas hatin', that's a bummer
I'ma skirt off
I got that bitch [?]
I got yo' bitch, she a trip
I got yo' bitch, she gon' go (uh, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bust her for sure
Uh, uh, uh
My life too lit, lit, I need a TV show (yah, yah)
Bitches they come and go like the money
But the money come first
Bitches they come and go like the money
But the money come first

[Chorus]
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I'm on a whole 'nother level (yeah, yeah)
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I'm on a whole 'nother level (ooh)
They try to copy my speed
They try to copy the spot
Drippin', drippin' like a faucet (grrrrr)
Drop, hoochie on my knees
Yeah, bad bitch on my knees
Drop, skinny dippin' with your bitch
Damn, I'm chokin' on my Trix

[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
Ooh, Lil Pump
I might go fuck up your re-up, ooh
Smokin' that loud, Wiz Khalifa, damn
Pull up, I shoot out two-seater, ooh (huh?)
I might go fuck up your beamer, huh
And I'm still tryna fuck Trina (brrr)
I'm whippin' a brick like I'm hurricane Katrina
I splash on that bitch like my name Aquafina, huh
Ooh, damn, huh, Lil Pump (brrr, brrr)
I might pull up in a foreign
I ain't fuck that bitch 'cause that bitch head is borin'
Shootin' a three like my name Michael Jordan
Bitch, don't call my phone 'cause a nigga recordin' (huh?)
My wrist lookin' crazy, it look like Ebola (brrr)
My bitch hella thick 'cause she from North Dakota (huh?)
I just bought a Audi, I just bought a Rover
Lil Pump

[Chorus]
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I'm on a whole 'nother level (yeah, yeah)
I'm on a whole 'nother level
I'm on a whole 'nother level (ooh)
They try to copy my speed
They try to copy the spot
Drippin', drippin' like a faucet (grrrrr)
Drop, hoochie on my knees
Yeah, bad bitch on my knees
Drop, skinny dippin' with your bitch
Damn, I'm chokin' on my Trix
