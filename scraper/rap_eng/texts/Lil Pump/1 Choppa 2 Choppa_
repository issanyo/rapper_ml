[Intro]
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
One choppa, two choppa, three choppa, four (goddamn)
Bitch I'm Lil Pump and I just fucked your hoe (brr)
Hunnid on my wrist, Balenciagas on my toes (goddamn)
I'm flexing everyday, call me Lil Pump D Rose (D Rose)

[Verse]
I just fucked your teacher now I'm fuckin' on your sis (your sis)
My diamonds look like Fiji water, I just took a piss (brr)
Took a flight to Cali yeah I'm smoking cannabis (that gas)
Extended grip on my shoes and spend it on my wrist (my wrist)

[Chorus]
One choppa, two choppa, three choppa, four (goddamn)
Bitch I'm Lil Pump and I just fucked your hoe (brr)
Hunnid on my wrist, Balenciagas on my toes (goddamn)
I'm flexing everyday, call me Lil Pump D Rose (D Rose)
