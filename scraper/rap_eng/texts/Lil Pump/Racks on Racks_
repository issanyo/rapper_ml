[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Ayee!

[Chorus]
Racks on racks on racks on racks on racks on racks, bitch (ooh, esskeetit)
Racks on racks on racks on racks on racks on racks, bitch (what, what, what, ooh)
None of my cars are rented (ooh)
All my black, my windows tinted
Fuck a bitch once and then I'm finished (ooh, brr)
Fuck a bitch once and then I'm finished (what, what, what)
Racks on racks on racks on racks on racks on racks, bitch (esskeetit)
Racks on racks on racks on racks on racks on racks, bitch (bitch, bitch, bitch!)
None of my cars are rented
All my black, my windows tinted (ooh)
Fuck a bitch once and then I'm finished
Fuck a bitch once and then I'm finished (black)
