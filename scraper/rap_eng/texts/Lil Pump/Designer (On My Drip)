[Verse 1: Dom Chasin' Paper]
Designer on my drip (drip)
You can't tell me shit (no)
I'ma fuck your bitch and then I nut up on her lip (on her lip)
I-I-I just flooded out my wrist (god damn)
I'ma call Little Pump, I know he got 'em bricks (brr, brr, brr)
Birds in the trap, watch 'em flip (watch 'em flip)
Diamonds on my ice, get a eclipse (you be blind!)
Lil' bitch, I ball like them Knicks
And I'm smoking all that gas like little Jeremy Lin (Jeremy Lin)
Legs like "bih!"
I'ma pass your bitch like innocence (D Rose!)
Runnin' wit a sat, Michael Vicks
...
Bitch on the shit, take a whiff
She on my phone sendin' pics
I'm at my crib wellin' zits
And I got that white Taylor Swift (white, white!)

[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
Designer on my drip
Fuck a nigga bitch
Fuck her then I dip

Pull up to the trap 'cause I have to flip 'em brick
Pull up on a goofy and I had to hit a lick
You can't tell me shit 'cause I'm flexing in a set piece
You can't tell me shit 'cause I'm flexing in a Bentley
You can't tell me shit 'cause I'm the Trapper of the Century
You can't tell me shit 'cause I counted on the 'fetti
