[Intro: 24hrs & Lil Pump]
Rock solid
Hitmaka!
Ooh, ooh
Right Now Sound
Lil Pump
Marii Beatz, turn me up
24hrs

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Cut the check, go bye-bye-bye
Foreign trips, Dubai-bai-bai (Homesick)
OG, get high-high-high
Lie detector (Hello), don't lie-lie-lie
Cut the check, go bye-bye-bye
Foreign trips, Dubai-bai-bai (Homesick)
OG, get high-high-high
Lie detector, don't lie-lie-lie

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
No, no-no-no-no
I ain't got no tickets to the show
You should call the fire marshall 'cause I want all the smoke
Hello? (Hello?) Dial 9-1-1
Damn, no time for the fakers
Courtside at the Lakers (Hey, Mo)
She said, "Twenty, this a hit"
Girl, you know that's every time I link with Hitmaka
Ice on my arm (Ice on my arm)
Pussy is wet, feel like a storm (Feel like a storm)
We make a porn (We make a porn)
$30 thousand in these sweats
Twenty up next, that's a bet (Bet)

[Chorus: 24hrs & Lil Pump]
Cut the check, go bye-bye-bye
Foreign trips, Dubai-bai-bai (Homesick)
OG, get high-high-high
Lie detector (Hello), don't lie-lie-lie
Cut the check, go bye-bye-bye
Foreign trips, Dubai-bai-bai (Homesick)
OG, get high-high-high
Yeah
Lie detector, don't lie-lie-lie
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
Fucked your bitch, told her, "Bye-bye-bye" (Yeah, ooh)
Smashed your main ho, nut in her eye-eye-eye (Brrt, Lil Pump)
Got a lot of racks on me (Ooh, yeah)
Got a lot of gas on me (Brrt, yeah)
Couple M's in jewelry (Ooh, yeah)
And my wrist like jetski (Ooh, yeah)
And I can't buy you no flight, no (Ooh)
Look at my bustdown shine (Yeah)
Pop some more molly (Ooh), drink some more lean
Damn I just missed my flight (Ooh, goddamn)
Pick a hundred bands up for the next show (Brrt)
I don't wanna fuck, bitch, I just want throat (No)
I didn't wanna tell you that your mama was a ho (Yeah)
Million dollars cash just layin' in the floor (Lil Pump)
All this ice on me drippin' (Ooh, drip)
Kick a bitch out, she trippin' (Yeah, ooh)
I'm too rich to listen (Ooh, brrt)
And my pinky ring still glisten (Yeah)
Told her don't lie-lie (Ooh)
No, you can't spend the night (Ooh, yeah)
Bitch do not ask me why (No, yeah)
Cut the check or bye (Yeah)

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Cut the check, go bye-bye-bye
Foreign trips, Dubai-bai-bai (Homesick)

Lie detector (Hello), don't lie-lie-lie
Cut the check, go bye-bye-bye
Foreign trips, Dubai-bai-bai (Homesick)
OG, get high-high-high
Lie detector, don't lie-lie-lie

[Verse 3: 24hrs]
No, no-no-no
I ain't gettin' caught up with you hoes
You should prolly call your jeweler 'cause none of your diamonds cold
Fuck, and they supposed to be froze
Ooh, Gucci on me head to toe
If you lie to me, I gotta let you go
Strip club, all the broke niggas back bag
24, time to show 'em where that bag at

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Cut the check, go bye-bye-bye
Foreign trips, Dubai-bai-bai (homesick)
OG, get high-high-high
Lie detector (hello), don't lie-lie-lie
Cut the check, go bye-bye-bye
Foreign trips, Dubai-bai-bai (homesick)
OG, get high-high-high
Lie detector, don't lie-lie-lie
