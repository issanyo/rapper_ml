[Intro]
Yung C, freestyle, show me what you got
Gotcha
Woot!

[Verse]
Look at these jits, they got some fucking ferrets
The people that write their lyrics, are their fucking parents
Man, I'm so sick, you will fucking drown
This is Ocean Gang, bitch you looking like a clown
Man, this ain't no game, you see me you better run
Cause you know I come out here with my guns
Nigga, you know I ain't no fucking nerdy
I will fuck your bitch and she will come out dirty
I fucked that bitch, shoot her down like a C-130
Bitches is all these niggas, it's the motherfucking coppers
Coming down the streets, break them like a fucking chopper
I forgot to add the motherfucking gunner
All these niggas know that they better be the runners
Cause when I come here, I come to rape
I don't come to play, man, cause I got a fresh state
Man, come on, these little jits some fags
I'm comin' down rapin', man, 'cause I got swag
I'm gettin' in the game, 'cause I am fresh as hell
Got these niggas locked up in the cell
And I, ended their career, and they not gon' do nothing
When they try to spit everything, then I'm gon' spit something
They just gon' stay, without saying a word
I will fuck your bitch

[Outro]
*laughs*
That's it man *laughs*
Why'd you stop man? No...
That's some real shit, man, how old are you?
I'm twelve man
You're twelve, man?
Yeah, man
I like that, man, I like that
Swag, cup, woot!
