[Chorus: Lil Ominous]
Big 30's poppin'

All these bodies droppin'

[Verse 1: Lil Ominous]
Big 30's poppin'
All these bodies droppin'
All my niggas mobbin'
Pussy would you stop it
We just dumbin' and robbin'
All o' you niggas just log in
I take a look at my pocket
I just be countin' my poppin'
I just be countin' 'em racks
I just be countin' 'em stacks
Flippin' 'em, flippin' 'em, flippin' 'em
Flippin' and I stay in the trap
Pussy boy, you too wack
Pussy boy got no straps
Pussy boy, you get blast
No case, got a mass
...


[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
Big 30's poppin'
All these bodies droppin'
I pull up on your block
Got a 30 with me and I hit you with that fuckin' Glock
Call my nigga Ominous
...

[Chorus: Lil Ominous]
Big 30's poppin'
Big 30's poppin'
Big 30's poppin'
All these bodies droppin'
Big 30's poppin'
Big 30's poppin'
Big 30's poppin'
All these bodies droppin'
Big 30's poppin'
Big 30's poppin'

All these bodies droppin'
Big 30's poppin'
Big 30's poppin'
Big 30's poppin'
All these bodies droppin'
