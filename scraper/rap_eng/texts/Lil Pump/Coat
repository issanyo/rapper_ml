Ouu, Jetski, ouu
Thank You Fizzle

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Spent thirty thousand on my coat (ouu)
Got a bad bitch from Mexico (yeah)
Got a hundred bands just layin' on the floor (ouu)
Pourin' up pints every day for show (huh)
The bitch is a fiend so I gave her ass coke (goddamn)
And I got twenty bricks on the four (yeah)
Smash five hoes in a row lets go (wow)
Smash five hoes in a row lets go (ouu)
Spent thirty thousand on my coat (yeah)
Spent thirty thousand on my coat (ouu)
Spent thirty thousand on my coat (yeah)
Spent thirty thousand on my coat (huh)
Bitch is a fiend so I gave her ass coke (ouu)
And I got twenty bricks on the four (goddamn)
Smash five hoes in a row lets go (yeah)
Smash five hoes in a row lets go (ouu)

[Verse 1: Destodubb]
When come to that lean I'm a goat
Five pints in my coat
Seventy a line was a quote
Gelato is all that I smoke
I wanna vote, dick in her throat
Sippin' on wok, while my dick in her throat
Pourin' up [?] as a joke
I am the player and I am the coach
Killing this game like a roach in the dark
I am the shit, I am a fart
Pourin' up lean is a art
I'm in a game but I dont play sports
Come in so muddy, it might just be dirt
I lift up her skirt, her pussy squirt
White boy lines, she rather snort
You lost the game, you gotta restart
Spend thirty bands on a sweatshirt

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Spent thirty thousand on my coat (ouu)

Got a hundred bands just layin' on the floor (ouu)
Pourin' up pints every day for show (huh)
