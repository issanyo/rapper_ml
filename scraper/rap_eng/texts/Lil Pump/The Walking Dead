Ayy, I see dead people when I'm walking outside
I was raised to be on my shit, stay ten toes outside

VERSE 1

Like is you really down to ride? Don't think you live this life
I could walk to hell and back, you know I'll be alright
I told my dog to watch my back 'cause him and I, we can't lack
Keep it silent when I'm walking, I stop tweaking with the flats and
I just made a call to Rex, see us on FaceTime with the strap
Down pat racked up on thirty bands, you know that
Usain Bolt to the guap, fall flat
Hurricane Chris my fist, oh yeah
Hold up shawty, you know that I tweak, ayy
Beams got me geeking, shit I bit down on my cheek, ayy
Pulled up in that Royce like who that there, like shit it's weef, ayy
Long way just from trapping out your mommy, shit I see, ayy
Thirty on the bezel, damn like yeah that's just a piece, ayy
I can't fuck no hoes, that bitch contagious like a sneeze, ayy
Blow pounds of the gas in outer space, you know my steez, yeah
Blow pounds of the gas in outer

Ouu, ayy
Pinkie ring froze, pinkie ring froze
Pinkie ring covered in gold
Too much diamonds on my neck, think I might choke
Had a threesome with your bitch with my eyes closed
Tell my side hoe bring it through the back door, oh!
I got eighty-thousand in my envelope, ouu
I just got a "Gucci Gang" medal though
Damn, I got some homies that went federal, ouu
Look at my two-tone Patek
I smash a hoe then forget
I got a fridge on my neck
I'm smokin' gas on a jet
Ouu, I love to flex
Ouu, blew out two million that Tootsie's, ayy
I made your auntie a groupie, ouu
And you know my life a movie, ayy
I got sticks like Call of Duty, ouu

You and yo' bitch kinda resemble Billy and Mandy
My bitch like Sandy
'Cause of the cheeks
Rode on my dick and said "It was so dandy"
Yippee ki-yay
I heard Freddie don't fuck with the feds
Yellow bitches on me like Lemonhead
Run up my sack like Ed and Edd and Eddy
Red and black sweater like my name is Freddy
Color spaghetti
Eyes so messy, pea-coat khaki
Never lackin', keep that .30 in my jacket
Look at the diamonds, they on hush mode
'Cause I bought diamonds for they ex hoe
It be so clear and so see through
Like a nigga lookin' through the peephole, uh
I just send them "XD rawr"
When I be texting your whore
Look at candy paint on car
It's brown like the Noah's Ark
Hit a stain like Mr. Clean
And put a nigga on game like Atari
Know how a nigga rockin' like guitar
What I'm smoking smellin' like a fart
Like Hercules, strong on these bitches, they back on knees
Back in that bitch like, "What's happening?"
Jump in that pussy like trampoline
Made that pussy sound like mac and cheese
When I hit it I'm just practicing
They be like, "Ski, you be snappening"
Teach me the ways of the saucin' king, hah?

My mom tatted on my arm, 'cause she mean a lot
I ain't never had no dad, never had no pops
I was always on that block, clutching on that Glock
Only way you leave the gang if it's in a box
Hard nights, it was cold, we ain't have no heat
And my bro passed away, I was sixteen
Had to get off my ass and get off in 'em streets
We ain't even have no water in that fucking sink
But now I'm up and I'm a stay focused and get the paper
Had to get my money up, rocking with the stainless
Any nigga disrespect, brother he gon' spank him
And I ain't playing with these niggas, leave a nigga dangerous
Stitched lips, be quiet, don't say shit
Stick together, that's how my little niggas made it
And I ain't fucking with no bitch if she basic
She ain't fucking for the free, this a fee for this famed dick
