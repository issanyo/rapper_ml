[Verse 1: Lil $ega]
PistolGripPapi, please don’t hurt nobody
These fiends hit my line, waitin’ in that lobby
If things get outta line, Lil Pump shell up shotty
Percocet Posse, she pop pussy sloppy
My name Lil $ega, I 'on’t play Atari
Ya man’s got bodyguards the size of A$AP Bari
I don’t care ‘bout cars till I’m in a ‘Rari
Life a game like Sorry, never sayin’ sorry
Music on guitar me, pull up with an Ernie
Shoutout Wristy Bands, shoutout SimSafari
Got green and purpp like Barney, please don’t pull up tardy
I bought the purpp like Smarties, my girl look like Barbie
I don’t care to party, on my Steve Harvey
Designer threads Barney's, this ain’t Ed Hardy

[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
Brr, ayy, bitch I’m off a Xan, off some stupid shit (stupid shit!)
Ayy, bitch I’m off a Xan, (brr, brr) off some stupid shit (gang, stupid shit!)
Ayy, I be with your bitch, (ayy, ayy) I been coolin’ in (pipe up, pipe up, pipe up!)
I be in the trap, bitch I be maneuverin’ (ayy, ayy maneuverin’!)
I be off the Xan, (woah) off some stupid shit (off some stupid shit)
I be off the Perc, (woah) off some stupid shit (off some stupid shit)
Pull up to the trap, (woah, woah) on some stupid shit (on some stupid shit)
Bitch I’m Lil Pump, (ayy, ayy) I stay maneuverin’ (gang shit)

[Verse 3: Lil $ega]
Block hot like Wasabi, 12 gauge K like Chinese
I’m on the front porch, please don’t try me, plug you with the IV
This safe a sport that I enjoy, ‘cause demons live inside me
I chirped Lil Pump, “I’m in Miami and I need a Grammy”
In Houston, Texas, feel like Sandy with a cup of that lean
We got Wockhardt when that Glock spark, I’ma see the police
I only cop exclusive beats, I can’t fuck with a lease
I see that Frisco got the freestyles, tell ‘em meet me in the streets
See I ‘on’t take ‘em to my sheets, that’s a place of peace
You see this shit ain’t finna leap, ‘cause I play for keeps
If you see me hittin’ licks then I had to eat
So if I stain you with that blood, clean that with those bleach
Barney’s world by the beach, I feel just like Screech

[Outro: Lil $ega]
PistolGripPapi, please don’t hurt nobody
PistolGripPapi, please don’t hurt nobody
PistolGripPapi, please don’t hurt nobody
