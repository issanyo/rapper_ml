[Snippet]
... I don't know how to act, ouu (huh?)
They call me the King Of The Trap, ouu
Walk in the store and spend eighty on my wrist (brr)
I smoke on Gelato, I sip Actavis
My diamonds, they dancin', it splashin' like piss
Kick a bitch out if she ain't suckin' dick (damn)
Sip so much lean that I feel like a dummy (ouu)
I might just go pull up and fuck on your daughter ...
