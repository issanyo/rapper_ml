[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh, brrr)
(Uh-huh, huh, huh)
(You, you, you)

[Chorus]
Lil Pump live in a castle
My bitch pussy lit and it look like a candle (yeah)
Gucci loafers don't do sandals (ooh)
Eat a bitch booty just like apple (yeah)
I drop a Xan in my Snapple, you walk in the mall and you looking for samples (yeah)
I fuck that bitch she disabled
The bitch broke she ain't got no cable
I fuck your momma then I fuck your sister
I fuck your momma then I fuck your sister
I fuck your momma, I found her on Twitter
I fuck your momma, I found her on Twitter
I fuck your momma on Backpage
She don't even know my damn age
Lil Pump ain't got no knowledge (ooh)
Bitch, I ain't ever going to college (ooh)

[Verse]
I might just bust on her face (ooh)
I think I just caught a case (ooh)
I got Louis on my waist (ooh)
Bitch, I always keep it based (yeah)
I pour the lean in my Fanta (huh)
I might pull up in a Phantom (ooh)
I take your daddy for ransom (huh)
I take your grandma for ransom (ooh)
I ain't got no education (huh)
And my auntie on probation (huh)
Mask on my dick like I'm Jason (ooh)
My bitch act like she Freemason (yuh)
Sippin on lean like a patient (ooh)
Lil Pump only fuck asians

[Chorus]
Lil Pump live in a castle
My bitch pussy lit and it look like a candle (yeah)
Gucci loafers don't do sandals (ooh)
Eat a bitch booty just like apple (yeah)
I drop a Xan in my Snapple, you walk in the mall and you looking for samples (yeah)
I fuck that bitch she disabled
The bitch broke she ain't got no cable
I fuck your momma then I fuck your sister
I fuck your momma then I fuck your sister
I fuck your momma, I found her on Twitter
I fuck your momma, I found her on Twitter
I fuck your momma on Backpage
She don't even know my damn age
Lil Pump ain't got no knowledge (ooh)
Bitch, I ain't ever going to college (ooh)
