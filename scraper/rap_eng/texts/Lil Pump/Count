[Hook]
I count these bags
I got this cash
Gun in my hand
Aimed at his back
I count these bags
I got this cash
Gun in my hand
Aimed at his back

[Verse 1: Lil Ominous]
I trust no soul
My heart so cold
Aimed at his nose
I got them cold
Why is you mad?
Diamonds like damn
Pistols go bam!
Take off your pants

[Hook]
I count these bags
I got this cash
Gun in my hand
Aimed at his back
I count these bags
I got this cash
Gun in my hand
Aimed at his back

[Verse 2: SmokePurpp]
Take a nigga, Purpp, nigga you know I get the dash
All you niggas pussy, all you niggas lame
I throw them lame niggas in the trash can
Bitches smoke purp with the man
Leavin' your brother in the back
Leavin' your (bang, bang, bang, bang)

[Verse 3: Lil Pump]
I turn yo baby brother to a tear drop
I got lean, I got walk is straight drop
I got mud, I steal purp
Pull up Lil Pump, he spray that purp
You know I got that fucking dope
Posting on the block, selling hella dope
Rollin' dice, sippin' pint on the floor
Sippin' mud till' I fall into the floor
