[Intro]
Ay, Lil Water drag that bitch by the elbow
Gang, okay

[Chorus]
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, lil' pump, lil' pump
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, I slap her in her neck (okay)
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, lil' pump, lil' pump
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, I slap her in her neck (okay)

[Verse]
Lil Pump, I'm flexing hard, flexing hard, flexing hard
Bitch I got blue hair and I'm looking like an Avatar
My loud pack smell like fish tank
My backwoods filled with dumb stank
I can't fuck with you, cause I know that all you niggas stains
My grandma selling loud pack and she selling cocaine
She run up on your block and she'll shoot you in the fuckin' brain
I was always known as the nigga that was selling crack
Now I'm at the top with your mama posted in the trap

[Chorus]
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, lil' pump, lil' pump
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, I slap her in her neck (okay)
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, lil' pump, lil' pump
Lil Pump had the lil' pump, I slap her in her neck (okay)
