Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro: Lil Pump]
CB on the beat mad, huh?

Lil' bit
Ouu, Lil Pump
Yeah
Huh?
Fasho'

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Callin them hoes fasho', fasho'
Gimme' some pack, fasho', fasho'
Butterfly McLaren wearing butterfly doors
Glock 17, and the drum hit the folks
I live in the drip fasho' (woo)
Wake up, I pour up a four, ooh (chyeah)
I just give your daughter some coke, huh
Cause it's just the way that it go, ooh
Calling them hoes fasho', fasho'
[?] fasho', fasho'
Don't pay for pussy fasho', fasho'
[?]
I live in the drip fasho' (drip)
Wake up, I pour up a four (yeah)
I give your daughter some coke (brr)
That's just the way that it go (it do)

[Verse 1: Offset]
Hey, hey

Sippin' on mud, the diamonds gushin', luxury (luxury)
Bust down all of my cousins
Test me, we shoot out your granny
Baguettes, they wet, they slippery
[?] they get from me
Keep dippin' me, ohh
