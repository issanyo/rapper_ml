[Intro: Blac Youngsta & Lil Pump]
Look at your lil' bitch ass

Don't wanna look at your ass when I talk to you (huh, yeah)

You ain't got shit (yeah)
You ain't gon' never have shit, you ain't gon' be shit
God told me you gon' be shit

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Ayy, I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Spanish bitches butt naked and they twerkin' on the stove
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold

[Verse 1: Lil Pump]
Drive the 'Rari off the lot, fuck my wrist up with the pot
Bitch, this shit will never stop (brr), presidential on the clock
Couple hoes up on a yacht, I can not fuck with the opps
Bitch, I made it to the top, go to class, I'm on the drop, ayy
Went to the gun store and I bought a rocket (ooh)
One million dollars, cash hangin' out my pocket (damn)
All these diamonds drippin' on me, feelin' like a water faucet
Broke niggas hatin' on me, man, this shit need to stop it
Lil Pump the freshest nigga comin' out my city
Hit AOD's and I'm blowin' straight fifties (brr)
In the kitchen whippin' Whitney, sippin' lean, I lost my kidney
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me off the Xan, I squeeze a titty, ayy
Dropped out of school, hopped in a private jet (brr)
Bitch, I'm on the lean, I can't pop no Percocet (no)
I got more money than your father, you can't be upset
I'm worth a couple millions, bitch, you know I love to flex

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Spanish bitches butt naked and they twerkin' on the stove
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
All that fuckin' talkin', you gon' make me hop out (hop out)
If you not talkin' money, you gon' make me walk out (walk out)
I talk real guns, I don't bring no prop out (props)
You can't go to war with me and try to cop out (cop)
I run over all my bitches and they still love me (gang)
I break bread with all my niggas, they'll kill for me (grr)
Grandma told me pull my britches up, I'm still thuggin' (grr)
I been crossed, had to cut off some of my real cousins (gang)
All this money I spent on a jet, coulda bought you and you and you (you)
All this money I spent on my neck, coulda sent you and you to school (school)
I got a house bigger than Elvis, got some foreign cars too (too)
Rest in peace Mr. Hugh Hef', I fuck porn stars too (too)
Ouu

[Bridge: Blac Youngsta]
Gang gang gang, ouu, yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy, Zaytoven, huh
Run that, run that motherfuckin' hook back, ha
Me, me, me, me and Pump just cooked that, ooh, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
Ayy, I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Spanish bitches butt naked and they twerkin' on the stove
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]

Ouu, you ain't got no money, go and get some bands

Foreign broad, superstar (foreign)

She wake up, eat the dick up, a Pop-Tart (like a Pop-Tart)
Ouu, I gotta flex on 'em
