[Verse]
100 on my wrist, bitch, I'm feelin' like D. Rose
Pop four Xans, now I'm feelin' like a hero (Superman)
Lean got me like Rio (Rio)
And my auntie on P.O. (P.O.)
100 on my wrist, 80 on a brick
Lil Pump never spend his money on a bitch (never)
Never trust a nigga, 'cause he actin' like a bitch (ooh)
Take a nigga bitch to the Motel 6 (brr)
I just broke my wrist, 'cause I'm whippin' in the kitchen (yoop)
Pass a brick to my mom, and I told her whip it (whip)
4 bands in the kitchen (ayy)
9 bands in the kitchen (ayy)
I just fucked your bitch (what?)
I just broke my wrist (okay)
I just fucked your bitch (ooh)
I just fucked your bitch (okay)

[Chorus]
80 on my wrist, 100 on my wrist (ooh, what?)
