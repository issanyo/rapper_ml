[Chorus: Lil Pump]
[?] I'm in my trap spot
Pull up with a [?] in my trap spot
We be in the kitchen whipping crack rock
I just fell in love with this damn guap
Call up Lil O he ran a beamer
30 with a beam on my damn [?]
Better not snitch if I get caught
If you do then I'm pulling up on yo block

[Verse: Lil Pump]
Pistol to your face
Designer at the waist
Big 30 on the [?] made me catch a damn case
If you snitch, then I'm pulling up on yo block
[?] and [?] yeah we all bloodshot
[?] niggas pussy all y'all niggas [?]
Mix the cola with the lean, you call the damn cops
Bitch I get the bands that will not stop
I just call your wifey just to give me top
Pull up in a foreign make you [?]
Lookin' at my [?], that bitch [?]
Pull up with the gang I let my pistol hang
Bitch they know I'm Lil Pump, I'm pulling up with gang

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
[?] I'm in my trap spot
Pull up with a [?] in my trap spot
We be in the kitchen whipping crack rock
I just fell in love with this damn gwap
Call up Lil O he ran a beamer
30 with a beam on my damn [?]
Better not snitch if I get caught
If you do then I'm pulling up on yo block
