Everybody in my gang is drug addicts
Chyeah, ooh, ooh (brr), chyeah, chyeah

Whole gang full of drug addicts (ooh, chyeah)
Take a lot of shit, forgot what happened (forgot what happened)
I ain't gon' lie, I got a habit (ooh, I got a habit)
Swear to God, you can't be on my status (I swear to God!)
Start the day off with a pint (yeah, brr-brr!)

I been smokin' since I was eleven (ooh, eleven)
I been poppin' pills since I was seven (chyeah, I was seven)
Told my pastor I don't do confessions (hell nah)
'Cause I pop a lot of molly for my breakfast (ooh, molly!)
I ain't never listen to nobody (no!)
In the courthouse off of ecstasy (god damn!)
And your baby mama layin' next to me! (huh?)
After she just sucked me, I just told her ass to leave (bitch get out, ooh)
Everybody 'round me like them Oxy's (brr!)
I was too leaned out to drive the 'Rari (huh?)
Made her ass wait two hours in the lobby (thot!)
I can't go outside, 'cause I see paparazzi (chyeah, brr)
Take another pill, now I'm feeling better (ooh, X)
Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang, yeah I'm a trend-setter (Gucci Gang!)
Bustin' all on your bitch, wiped it off with my sweater (ooh!)
I'm a drug addict, I'm richer than my professor (man, fuck school)

Whole gang full of drug addicts (ooh, chyeah)
Take a lot of shit, forgot what happened (forgot what happened)
I ain't gon' lie, I got a habit (ooh, I got a habit)
I swear to God, you can't be on my status (I swear to God!)
Start the day off with a pint (yeah, brr-brr!)
I'ma show you how to live life (yeah, ooh!)
Take a lot of drugs, don't think twice (wow)
