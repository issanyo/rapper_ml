[Intro: iON]
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: iON]
I-I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
Smokin' on loud, she stank
Smokin' on loud, she stank
Trappin' the pills out the tank
Trappin' them pills out the tank
Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, Big Bank
Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
Trappin' them pills out the tank
Smokin' on loud, she stank

[Verse 1: Lil Pump]
In the kitchen whippin' babies
Whippin' crack, like the eighties
Twenty thousand on Mercedes
In the kitchen whippin' babies
Hundred thousand on my wrist
Lil Pump fucked yo' bitch
Pull up flexin' bitch, I'm flexin like I'm Scottie Pippen
Every time you see me, I be double cup sippin'
Damn, drip
Damn, drip
Pull up, flexin', on yo, bitch

[Chorus: iON]
I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
Smokin' on loud, she stank
Smokin' on loud, she stank
Trappin' the pills out the tank
Trappin' them pills out the tank
Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, Big Bank, Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
Trappin' them pills out the tank
Smokin' on loud, she stank

[Verse 2: iON]
I had a good one, just get it
They tellin' these stories, but they never did it
I'm flippin', I'm flippin', I'm flippin', I'm flippin'
I be water whippin', I be with the fishes
I feel like a genie, she makin' her wishes
I'm smokin' on gas and I smoke by the pound
Grabbing the ass while she lay on my couch
You callin' her phone, my dick in her mouth
Fuck her then go kick her out
Please get the fuck out my house
I'ma go call you a Uber
All of your diamonds, they fu
Boy, your ass still rockin' fu
I cannot fuck with your crew
Don't fuck with me, I got loose
Me, I just win I cannot (lose)
I just be tweakin that cig
All of these bitches they be (loose)

[Chorus: iON]
I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
Smokin' on loud, she stank
Smokin' on loud, she stank
Trappin' the pills out the tank
Trappin' them pills out the tank
Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, Big Bank, Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, okay
Big Bank, Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
I just want me a Big Bank
Trappin' them pills out the tank
Smokin' on loud, she stank
