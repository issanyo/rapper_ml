[Verse 1: Richysamo]
If I see a opp, shit tragic
Richysamo bitch a little madness
Ran off with that sack John Madden
Skrt off in that Lamb like I'm Batman
I'm with gang you can't come around here
Got my diamonds dancing like a fucking chandelier
You a goofy nigga pillow talking in her ear
Sipping straight drop graduated from a beer
My bitches geeked as fuck
Pull up Bentley truck
AK in the trunk
Leave a nigga slumped
Lil Pump keep a shotty tucked
I'ma pour a four, face a 0, I stay with my pole
Let a nigga know, he won't smoke, let that .40 blow

[Hook: Lil Pump]
.45 do the magic
All my niggas keep a ratchet
You a broke boy you could have it
All my niggas got the ratchet
.45 do the magic
Broke boys you could have it
.45 do the magic
All my niggas keep a ratchet
.45 do the magic
.45 do the magic
.45 do the magic
.45 do the magic

[Verse 2: Lil Pump]
.45 do the magic
Make your grandma do a back flip
On my bed I poured some Xanax
I don't know what the fuck happened (Esketit!)
I pop some Molly and some Ecstasy
I asked my doctor what else do I need?
I need some Xanax and some fucking weed
Bitch I'm high just like a bumblebee

[Bridge: Lil Pump]
Bullets clapping down the fucking block
Richysamo serving fucking rock
Pull up on your sister slap her with a Glock
[POP POP POP POP POP]

[Hook: Lil Pump]
.45 do the magic
All my niggas keep a ratchet
You a broke boy you could have it
All my niggas got the ratchet
.45 do the magic
Broke boys you could have it
.45 do the magic
All my niggas keep a ratchet
.45 do the magic
.45 do the magic
.45 do the magic
.45 do the magic
