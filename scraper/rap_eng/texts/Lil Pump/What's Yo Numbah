I don't give a fuck cause my bitch gon go to heaven
My bitch gon go to heaven but she don't go to church
I slap her with the dick and I know it's gonna hurt
I slap her in the chin and I slap her in the boob
I slap her in the neck and I'm like, "Who the fuck are you?"
I pull up on my bitch, eat her like a piece of ham

Everytime I slap her bitch, I'm wet like a hunnid gram
I got a backwood and I finna roll a gram
