[Intro: News Anchors & Lil Pump]
You can see Lil Pump wandering the halls of a school carrying huge bags of pot
Turns out that school was a local Catholic elementary school
A teacher gets slapped with a bag of marijuana in this video
Yeah, Lil Pump, ooh, yeah, yeah, huh, brr
And the rapper’s name is Lil Pump
Yuh, Lil Pump
Yeah, huh?
(Brr)
Yeah, yuh
Yeah, yeah
Ayy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Spanish bitches' butt naked and they twerkin' on the stove
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes (brr)
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze (yeah, uh)
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse]
Drive the 'Rari off the lot, fuck my wrist up with the pot (ooh)
Bitch, this shit will never stop (brr), presidential on the clock
Couple hoes up on a yacht, I can not fuck with the opps (huh?)
Bitch, I made it to the top, go to class, I'm on the drop, ayy
Went to the gun store and I bought a rocket (ooh)
One million dollars, cash hangin' out my pocket (damn)
All these diamonds drippin' on me, feelin' like a water faucet
Broke niggas hatin' on me, man, this shit need to stop it
Lil Pump the freshest nigga comin' out my city
Hit AOD's and I'm blowin' straight fifties (brr)
In the kitchen whippin' Whitney, sippin' lean, I lost my kidney
Ain’t nobody fuckin' with me off the Xan', I squeeze a titty, ayy
Dropped out of school, hopped in a private jet (brr)
Bitch, I'm on the lean, I can't pop no Percocet (no)
I got more money than your father, you can't be upset
I'm worth a couple millions, bitch, you know I love to flex

[Chorus]
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Spanish bitches' butt naked and they twerkin' on the stove
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
I got fast cars, bad bitches and designer clothes
Couple thousand on my wrist and my neck is on froze
Too much racks in my pocket that my wallet can't fold
