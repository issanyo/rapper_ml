[Intro]
Ayy, woah, ayy, shit
Ayo Lil Pump for real, though

[Chorus]
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy
I'm fuckin' your mama, I fuckin' your wifey
I'm fuckin' your mama, I fuckin' your wifey
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy

[Verse]
I get so much money I swim in the sea
I'm off of the perc and you know where I be
I get soo much money, shout out to the Heat
I'm draggin' your bitch right across of the street
That bitch a lil' stank, I was smelling her feet
Your breath a lil' stank, so please don't talk to me
Shout out to the plug cause he movin' keys
And Flacko got out so we finna smoke trees

[Chorus]
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy
I'm fuckin' your mama, I fuckin' your wifey
I'm fuckin' your mama, I fuckin' your wifey
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy
I get soo much money, my chain is soo icy
