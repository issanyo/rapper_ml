[Hook]
I try to change
I don't want to sell no dope, no more
I don't want the feds knocking on my door
All the police keep watching my home
All these damn fiends keep calling my phone
I try to change
I try to change
But the dope game keep calling my name
(I try to change)
I try to change
I try to change
But the dope game keep calling my name
Yeah, uh
(I try to change)

[Verse 1]
I try to change myself for the better
My friend in prison just wrote me a letter
Telling me to stop flipping everybody snitching
Sometimes I wish that god would take me out this fucking kitchen
I'm feeling paranoid
I don't feel like I am living
Sometimes I'm blinded by the profit that I'm making
Police watching
I know that they hating
I'm only 21
I stay with my gun
I promise my momma
That I would never be a bum
Every time I pray to god, I never get an answer
I always ask myself why a child gets cancer?
I know that it's something that we would never know
Lord can you hear me
I want to stop selling drugs

[Hook]
I try to change
I don't want to sell no dope, no more
I don't want the feds knocking on my door
All the police keep watching my home
All these damn fiends keep calling my phone
I try to change
I try to change
But the dope game keep calling my name
(I try to change)
I try to change
I try to change
But the dope game keep calling my name
Uh
(I try to change)

[Verse 2]
I got a story to tell
See everything I say is real
I've done turned down a 3 million dollar deal
Cuz I'm my own boss
I got here by myself
Every time I ask for help
I always talking to myself
So I started selling drugs
And increasing my wealth
Cuz everytime I asked for help I was just wasting my breath
Only thing I want to be is a motherfucking legend
And the fact that i'm on tour is a motherfucking blessing
All my old friends started getting mad at me
If this money makes you mad at me
You ain't no friend to me
I lost a lot of friends to be honest man it's cool with me
"Stitches you a piece of shit"
Add that to my biography!

[Hook]
I try to change
I don't want to sell no dope, no more
I don't want the feds knocking on my door
All the police keep watching my home
All these damn fiends keep calling my phone
I try to change
I try to change
But the dope game keep calling my name
(I try to change)
I try to change
I try to change
But the dope game keep calling my name
(I try to change)
