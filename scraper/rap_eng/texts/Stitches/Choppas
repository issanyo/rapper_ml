[Hook]
All my niggas ready, we strapped with them choppas
All my niggas ready, we strapped with them choppas
I flee the scene, I leave the country in my chopper
I flee the scene, I leave the country in my chopper

[Verse 1]
I kill a nigga, leave the scene up in my chopper
I just got two Mexicos riding in my chopper
It’s a dirty game, oh yeah, it’s a dirty world
I’m that nigga that’s gonna sell cocaine to a pregnant girl
Who gives a fuck about what a nigga think 'bout me?!
I catch a chocolate at the judge, yeah, I am guilty
My lawyer good, so he gon’ beat that case
I’ll shoot ya in the face, it will read about yo race
No discrimination when it comes to that murder, nigga
And if I find out you snitchin’ then it’s a murder, nigga
When it comes to my respect, that’s all I am about
You say you tottin’ choppas but that’s somethin’ that I doubt

[Hook]
All my niggas ready, we strapped with them choppas
All my niggas ready, we strapped with them choppas
I flee the scene, I leave the country in my chopper
I flee the scene, I leave the country in my chopper

[Verse 2]
The police pulled me over on my way to the airport
These choppers only thing I'm trusting gives me my support
I kill a pig quick, now I'm gon' cut your bacon, nigga
Aye, fuck the police 'cause a lot of them fools be faking, nigga
Every show that I perform I got cops up in now
They always raid my tour bus 'cause I got cocaine up in there
But they can't find it, I bet a million they can't find it
I might just kill all these cops just because a nigga grimy
So before you pull me over you should think twice
Because today might be the day that you gon' lose your life
Fuck the DEA, fuck all of the feds
I'm like Mexicans, [?] gon' cut your head

[Hook]
All my niggas ready, we strapped with them choppas
All my niggas ready, we strapped with them choppas
I flee the scene, I leave the country in my chopper
I flee the scene, I leave the country in my chopper
