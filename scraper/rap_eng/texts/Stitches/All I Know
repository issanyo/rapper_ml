[Intro]
It's all I know (3x)

[Hook]
I try to stop sellin' drugs
But what am I gon' do? (But what am I gon' do?)
It's all I know, it's all I know
It's all I know, It's all I know (2x)
Tell me what the fuck i'm gon' do

[Verse 1]
D-R-U-G-S I can get it through UPS
I know that there's a risk, but I do it for them stacks
You start to get used to it pack after pack
The Feds catch one; but they still keep on comin'
Charge after charge, and you ain't even know it
Then the FEDS come at the least expected moment
That's the consequences for livin' up in the moment
Every time I serve a soul, I been paranoid as fuck
In my vocabulary there's no word called "trust"
Every time I serve a soul, I been paranoid as fuck
In my vocabulary there's no word called "trust"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How did I buy these shoes? --  Sellin' drugs!
How did I buy these chains? -- Sellin' drugs!
Fuck a 9 to 5, It's for a scrub!
You talk about robbin' me? I draw your blood!
Started with a 8 ball (True story!)
Now I got my own home (Two story!)
I put work up in a lot hoods, but I'm tryna stop
All it takes is one hater to get ya ass popped
But I'mma be a thug 'til the day my heart stop
Two middle fingers up like I'm 2Pac
Gold Rolly on my wrist; you got a G-Shock
I'm only 18, Lord, please help my music pop
And if my music don't pop
Then it's back to cookin' them rocks
Police circlin' in my block
I got fo' O's in my sock
If they turn them lights on
Then I runnin', I don't stop
God forbid that I get caught
My name Stitches; I don't flop

[Hook]
