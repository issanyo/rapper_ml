You've written a hundred books and you live on a 10 story block
Your old mans face on fire.. living in a vacant lot
Living in a shoe box.. like sand inside your socks
Your old mans face at the bar.. its the only place he's got
You think you've been lonely before (Until your face turns blue)
And the books you read may not be real (These are true stories.. true..)
(It's real..) Reaction
You've taken just one look.. at all the things you've got
This junkies face on fire.. never gonna break the locks
Living in a shoe box.. like sand inside your socks
And the old mans face at the bar is the only place he's got
You think you've been lonely before (Until your face turns blue)
And the books you read may not be real (These are true stories.. true..)
(It's real..) Reaction!
You've taken just one look.. you're living as a parking block
The old mans face on fire gotta give em what you really want
Living in a shoe box.. like sand inside your socks
The old mans face at the bar.. its the only place he's got!
You think you've been lonely before (Until your face turns blue)
And the books you read may not be real (These are true stories.. true..)
(It's real..) Connection.. Reaction..
