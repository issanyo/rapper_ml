[Intro]
HAHAHA!
BRRRRR (pussy pig)
I'm cookin' bacon

[Verse]
Fuck the police, fuck the DEA
Fuck Homeland security, they tryna fuck with me
They came in my crib, put me in tie wraps
Askin' me, "Where them drugs at?"
Boy, I ain't gon' tell 'em
But if they bring them K9 dogs I know that they gon' smell 'em
I just found out where them cops live
So when I shoot up they crib I can see 'em drop dead
Put some bacon on the barbecue
You's a cop, I cannot fuck with you
No respect for a snitch nigga
I know when you was in school you was a bitch nigga
The federali's put my brothers in the pen
But when them boys hop out of prison, they drivin' foreign
I swear to God, I throw a party when a cop dies
They'll shoot yo ass for no reason and then will straight lie
They locked my dog Leo up for a bullshit charge
But I roll with the higher power, we gon' beat the charge
Everybody know, who Stitches is
Cause I was flippin' on that corner as a little kid
I'm talkin' weed and white, and crack throughout the night
Mama tellin' me what I am doin' isn't right
But I don't really care
I'm in the strip club at fourteen years old
Throwin' money in the air, in the law's eyes it ain't fair
When I was young, I did a lotta dirt
I pulled the trigger quick, and put you in the dirt
Fuck the police, fuck the DEA
Fuck Homeland security, cause they nothin' to me
I'm still gon' sell all these drugs
I'm still gon' rock with these slugs
And now I got cancer so just know, I do not care
The next time that them pussy pigs run up, they dying right there
