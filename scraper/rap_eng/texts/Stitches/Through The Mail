[Chorus]
I'm pouring up a pint, I'm smokin' on that kush
Whippin' up cocaine, bitch I'm about to cook
You wanna sell drugs, follow my foot steps
Then you'll receive cocaine at your door step

Through the mail (x9)
I get cocaine through the mail

[Verse 1]
I'm whippin' that dope in the kitchen
Bitch you know that I'm sellin' them pigeons
Bitch you know that I'm servin' them chickens
They hatin' on me because they know Im winnin'
Cocaine bitch, it made me
Mom gave birth to a drug dealin' baby
I can't sell to you if you a pussy
If you a real one we could cook up a cookie
Drug lord, I am when it comes to the mail
Im the man, I can put them kilos in your hand
Don't try to go stunt postin' on the 'gram
Feds watchin', all day
I've been sellin' drugs, all day
Sendin' bricks through the mail, all day
Stay true to the game, I'm one way

[Hook]
B-R-I-C-K-S
Through the mail (x2)
B-R-I-C-K-S
Through the mail
I get cocaine through the mail

[Chorus]
I'm pouring up a pint, I'm smokin' on that kush
Whippin' up cocaine, bitch I'm about to cook
You wanna sell drugs, follow my foot steps
Then you'll receive cocaine at your door step

Through the mail (x9)
I get cocaine through the mail

[Verse 2]
Im sendin' bricks through the mail
If I go to jail, no bail
Still flippin' bricks, and that sell
While I make a call on my cell
Cocaine is one hell of a drug
Take a bump of mine's, and you fall in love
I only sell bricks, I don't sell dubs
And I don't sell dope to no scrubs
Re-write, that's you
Rippin' off your custo's ain't cool
You should come to my drug dealer school
It's time for you to stop actin' like a fool!

[Hook]
B-R-I-C-K-S
Through the mail (x2)
B-R-I-C-K-S
Through the mail
I get cocaine through the mail

[Chorus]
I'm pouring up a pint, I'm smokin' on that kush
Whippin' up cocaine, bitch I'm about to cook
You wanna sell drugs, follow my foot steps
Then you'll receive cocaine at your door step

Through the mail (x9)
I get cocaine through the mail
