[Chorus]
Drivin' down the block
In my drop top
One more rapper shot down like 2Pac
They get a picture of you, put in on a white Tee
Now you're just another fucking stupid memory
Drivin' down the block
In my drop top
One more rapper shot down like 2Pac
They get a picture of you, put in on a white Tee
Now you're just another fucking stupid memory

[Verse 1]
Rex, if you're listening to this song, your Daddy's probably dead
You're growing up so fast, remember you used to wet the bed?
I'm sorry, that I'm not there to raise you
They caught your dad in traffic, he got murdered by a hater
See, I didn't have my father, so maybe you'll be fine
Every moment we spent together was an amazing time
I left you abandoned, I left you stranded
You feel deserted, I know that you're hurting
One thing is for certain, that I'm watching over on top of your shoulder, it's making you colder
You want revenge, you grab a gun
You're loading it up and you don't give a fuck
I know how it feels, I've been there before

[Refrain]
"And once you kill that mother fucker, please let your mother know"
"Mom, I killed Daddy's killer, it's done."

[Chorus]
Drivin' down the block
In my drop top
One more rapper shot down like 2Pac
They get a picture of you, put in on a white Tee
Now you're just another fucking stupid memory
Drivin' down the block
In my drop top
One more rapper shot down like 2Pac
They get a picture of you, put in on a white Tee
Now you're just another fucking stupid memory

[Verse 2]
Hatred inside of your eyes, the lies you tellin' these bitches just to get inside
Instead of praying to god for more blessings, you're praying to god that I die
Now ain't that some shit..
You're worried about another man
You should be worried about your bitch becoming a die hard Stitches fan
She licking the tip and she with her friend
Now you wanna kill me even more
She got my dick in her hand
She singin' on it like a microphone
I know you don't like me, I know you wanna kill me
Even if you kill me, the streets will always feel me
I'm about to be the headlines on the news
But if I'm being honest, that's some shit I'm used to

[Chorus]
Drivin' down the block
In my drop top
One more rapper shot down like 2Pac
They get a picture of you, put in on a white Tee
Now you're just another fucking stupid memory
Drivin' down the block
In my drop top
One more rapper shot down like 2Pac
They get a picture of you, put in on a white Tee
Now you're just another fucking stupid memory
Drivin' down the block..
