That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider

[Verse 1]
The police pulled me over but my bitch a rider
She took the plain photo
Work like she the drug supplier
They found a pistol, they found cocaine
They know the truth, I'm the one to blame
I'm a drug dealer, it runs in my vains
And this drug game, it brings so much pain
I done lost my homies to drug deals
That's why I never leave my house
Without my steel

[Hook]
That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider

[Verse 2]
I remember times when I ain't had no cash
But you had my back, you gave me all your cash
I remember them days, I remember them days
I was fucked up and I was the only one to blame
Hard times make a nigga go crazy
But ain't no better feeling
Than putting the smell of my babies
So, I keep up cooking, I keep up flipping
Driving around with all these chickens
The police pulled me over, haha, but guess what

[Hook]
That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider
She'll hold my dope, she'll take that charge
That girl right there's a rider
