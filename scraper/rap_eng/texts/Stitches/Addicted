[Hook]
I was addicted to drugs, I was

And what I felt
It felt so good
You made me feel I could fly

[Verse 1]
I done been through the pain
I done been through struggle
I was really in the streets
I really had to hustle

But then I tried my drug
And then I fell in love
It made me feel so good
Felt like I was above

I lost a lot of money
I lost a lot of friends
I used to get depressed
And feel like it's the end

I have been through pain

[Hook]
I was addicted to drugs, I was

And what I felt
It felt so good
You made me feel I could fly

[Verse 2]
Wake up and take a bump
I do not want to sleep
Nightmares from my past
This shit gets really deep

I used to shoot my guns
I was just having fun
Then I caught a case
Now I'm on the run

Dreaming of being famous
Now I got what I wanted
But ain't no privacy
When I go out to eat

I'm trying to raise my family
Without no legal problems
But every time I wake up
I got another problem

Everybody tryna see me
They tryna take my money
Even my own friends tryna see me for my money

I have been through pain

[Hook]
I was addicted to drugs, I was

And what I felt
It felt so good
You made me feel I could fly
