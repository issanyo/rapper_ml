[Verse 1]
Have a couple drinks then dinner then I dessert you
Does that mean imma hurt you or does that mean imma work you
I can't promise that imma be yours but I fuck you till you sweat out your pores
Take off your panties leave them on the floor meet me in the playroom and shut the door
I'll spank you hard cause I know you like it no emotions envolved so bitch no fighting
But I knock out that pissy like I was Tyson put in your mouth but bitch don't bite it
I'm about to tie you up are you ready?
I'm about to blindfold you are ready?
I'm don't think you are ready for me!
