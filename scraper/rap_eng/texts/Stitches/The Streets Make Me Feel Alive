[Hook x2]

The streets make me feel alive
Hustling night and day
I think I'm running out of time
I just wanna fly away

[Verse 1]

I never seen a girl put it down like you
You make a hustler like me fall in love with you
You got those hips and then lips and a attitude
You got some drama in your life but to me that's cool
I said I could be your life saver
I know they told you I was a player
Will I break your heart?
Maybe I will, she said daddy just keep it real
I did some things in my past but I think me and you are gon' last

[Hook x2]

The streets make me feel alive
Hustling night and day
I think I'm running out of time
I just wanna fly away
I say put your hands up!

[Verse 2]

I'm the boss in my city
Girls always showing titties
I'm on the tour the first night
I guarantee that Imma hit it
Money, money, money on my mind
I'm living too fast and I cannot press rewind
Up in the streets, flipping that dope
Praying to god just to give me some hope
Everyday I'm at a party
Drinkin' till I get retarded
Will I stop selling? Maybe I will
Until them Imma keep it real
But I don't know how long it will last
Till then Imma count this cash

[Hook x2]

The streets make me feel alive
Hustling night and day
I think I'm running out of time
I just wanna fly away
I say put your hands up!
