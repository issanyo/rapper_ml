[Chorus]
These niggas ain't real, dawg
I shoot guns to kill, dawg
I just want some meals, dawg
Screaming fuck the deal, dawg
These niggas ain't real nah
These niggas ain't real nah
I shoot guns to kill all
I shoot guns to kill all
These niggas ain't real, nah
These niggas ain't real, nah
I shoot guns to kill all
I shoot guns to kill all

[Verse 1]
My back against the wall
I'm loosing my mind, is time for murder
How could I see you as a threat?
When you are somebody that I never heard of?
You got a uzi, I got a teck
And my homie keep a burner
I give them the look
They laugh like a creep
Then we go, then we just burn ya
I'm tired of liars, I'm tired of rumors
They gained me some money that I should've got sooner
Blackballed in the rap game, them brothers saw me sell cocaine
Them brothers see me in the prison though
My children up in [?]
Writing letters, making calls
Thinking about the days we used to ball

[Bridge]
I shoot you down
I shoot you down, down, down
I shoot you down (I shoot you down)
I shoot you down
I shoot you down, down, down
I shoot you down (I shoot you down)
I shoot you down, down, down

[Chorus]
These niggas ain't real, dawg
I shoot guns to kill, dawg
I just want some meals, dawg
Screaming fuck the deal, dawg
These niggas ain't real nah
These niggas ain't real nah
I shoot guns to kill all
I shoot guns to kill all
These niggas ain't real, nah
These niggas ain't real, nah
I shoot guns to kill all
I shoot guns to kill all

[Verse 2]
If I pulled drive-by, bandana on my face (Haha)
If I pulled drive-by, then Imma have to beat the case (I beat it)
All of that shit you talk on the phone
Keep the energy when I'm in your home
Robbery, homicide, Are you a gangsta? You decide
I don't want any apology letters
I don't wanna hear that bullshit that you happy that I'm doing better
There is a lie, niggas like you should be crucified
The only time that you believe in God Is every time you about to die
You the type to go to jail read a bible
I'm the type to go to jail and be a psycho
You the type of motherfucker shoot a handgun
I'm the type of motherfucker shoot a rifle
And I know, that you know, that I know that you is a damn hoe
And i know, that you know I'm a devil driving in a Lambo

[Chorus]
These niggas ain't real, dawg
I shoot guns to kill, dawg
I just want some meals, dawg
Screaming fuck the deal, dawg
These niggas ain't real nah
These niggas ain't real nah
I shoot guns to kill all
I shoot guns to kill all
These niggas ain't real, nah
These niggas ain't real, nah
I shoot guns to kill all
I shoot guns to kill all
