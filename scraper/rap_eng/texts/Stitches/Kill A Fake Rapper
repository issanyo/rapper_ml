[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm smokin' on that super gas, you might not even wanna smoke with me
Sellin' dope, my niggas rob you, don' even wanna buy dope from me
Not a lil flipper, I'm sucker free, not lil tipper they crown me king
[?], give 'em Mac 10, scrap on me now think I'm just rappin'
[?] shout out, I make a nigga run, like a nigga just signed for a USA team
Kick him in the ass, now he got hemorrhoid, that's what you got for trynna fuck with my boys
Thou shall not kill and I know it's God's will, but gotta take some with the lord
[?] as a sword and I know it's a sword, but [?]
Make the crowd applaud, when I pull up in the Charger, pull up in the Charger, nigga, no charge
100,000 dollars got 'em taken it apart, niggas [?] die so hard
8 bottle, molly, I'm hard from the start, 24/7 mamma keep me awoke
Credit card Friday bought, but the bitch go hard and I want an abort

[Hook x2: Stitches]
Aye, let's kill a fake rapper
Let's kill a fake rapper
Let's kill a fake rapper
Let's kill a fake rapper
You ain't never seen no dope
You ain't never seen no dope
You ain't never seen no dope
Pussy ass rapper, you ain't seen no dope

[Verse 2: Stitches]
I'm gettin' sick and tired of these fake ass rappers
Imma 'bout to go on a robbin' spree
So you better give them gold chains to me
Your entourage cannot do nothin'
Cause when they see me, they start runnin'
Ain't no hesitation in my blood, nigga, I just start gunnin'
Fuck a nigga named Young Jeezy
I told the nigga he can come see me
We can throw them hands, we can tote them guns
But that nigga scared to come see me
I think I made him shit himself
So I gotta buy the nigga some diapers
Talkin' 'bout you sold that coke
Talkin' 'bout you part of BMF, you's a joke
If anything, you was a driver
But you never was no drug supplier
You probably ain't seen no brick
And you damn sure ain't hittin' no lick
I know the truth about ya
You's a confidential informant
Me and Gucci 'bout to cook you, boy
But this ain't no George Foreman
You rappin' about a fairytale
You ain't never owned no damn scale
I can teach you how to be a real drug dealer
Send bricks through the mail
But I don't fuck with Jeezy
Cause that nigga real sleazy
And until they put me in a grave
Imma wait for him to come see me

[Hook x2: Stitches]
Aye, let's kill a fake rapper
Let's kill a fake rapper
Let's kill a fake rapper
Let's kill a fake rapper
You ain't never seen no dope
You ain't never seen no dope
You ain't never seen no dope
Pussy ass rapper, you ain't seen no dope
