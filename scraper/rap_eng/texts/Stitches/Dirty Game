[Hook]
It's a dirty game, it's a dirty world
I sell cocaine to a pregnant girl
Ain't no tellin' what I do for that paper
And when it comes to sellin' dope, I got a major
(Dirty, dirty game)
40 pounds of weed, 40 different flavours
I'm not a drug dealer, I'm a life saver, saver, saver
Everyday in my life I'm countin' paper
I'm Stitches, but I'm also your loyal savior

[Verse 1]
I'm Stitches, I know how to sell it (I move it)
I don't believe these stories these boys be tellin'
Yo goons ain't goons, my goons they all be fellings (For real)
They gon' slice yo ass up like a watermelon
Word around my hood is you snitchin', bruh (Why?)
I can't fuck with you, especially if you snitchin', bruh (Hell no!)
I'm down to do the bed if I did the crime (I will)
But I don't get caught doin' crime, cuz that's wastin' time (Fuck police!)
One thing I never do is wait in line (No!)
Sexual encounters, all my hoes dimes
All this dough all up on me, I look like a goldmine
So it ain’t my fault, is my gold fault that yo bitch now mine
Stitches!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
DEA tryna catch Stitches (Fuck the Feds!)
They know I got cash, they in the club watchin' me tipin' (They watchin'!)
Heard they can sell your own bricks, guess what? I can flip it (I got it!)
Johnny Depp, Johnny Depp, look all this blow I’m flippin'
Jordans on my feet (Ok), you ain't seen them yet (Never!)
Chains up on my neck, hoppin' on that private jet
All my way to Dubai and Paris, you ain't been there yet (You jealous!)
They say that life's a risk, well I'm gon' play some bet
Bounty up in yo head, now y'all suckas dead (Oh no!)
Consequences, y'all earned workin' with the Feds (Fuckin' right!)
Bounty up in yo head, now y'all suckas dead
Consequences, y'all earned  (Workin' with the Feds)
