[Hook: Str8 Kash]
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style

[Verse 1: Str8 Kash]
Young nigga, seventeen, touch my first block and I made it dissapear
(I sold my soul for a kilo)
Lost all my friends cause they snakes, nigga, I ain't got no fuckin' peers (Fuck 'em!)
(Trade my life for that life style)
Polo Fish Scale, niggas lookin' like they fishin' up out that peer
Untamable, undeniable, sunday morning, no church, no bible
What you got, lil nigga? Ten blocks and a rifle
We just stackin' paper, paper taller than the Eiffel
Lord, help me, know it was wrong but I got it done
Shit we do for these fast cars and these large funds and these dumb broads
Now I roll but I did so broad
Snitches talkin', couldn't take that charge
Hollows bustin', that mag revolvers
This slow life on top of y'all
Six AM and I still ain't home
Water whippin', nigga, let it soak
Bet your life I won't come back broke (Bet your life, nigga)

[Hook: Str8 Kash]
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style

[Verse 2: Str8 Kash]
Dirty price but I had to pay, carry .45's chunk full of baby's
(I sold my soul for a kilo)
Blue pills keep on accumulate 'em
Fucked the girl and your boy's lady
All up in my Mercedes
Walter White, call it cocaine
Rims bigger than the [?] lanes
Tatted up, tryna hide the pain
(Hide the pain, hide the pain)
Bitch, I thought I told ya
I came up sellin' bodas
Million dollar, TMI, VVR soldier
Ridin' with pistola
Coca in her chocha
Sold my soul for gold and I'll regret it when I'm older
Ridin' with pistola, coca in her chocha
Sold my soul for gold and I'll regret it when I'm older

[Hook: Str8 Kash]
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style
I sold my soul for a kilo, trade my life for that life style
