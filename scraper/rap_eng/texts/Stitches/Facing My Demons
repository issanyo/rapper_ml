[Verse 1]
Why do I feel like I gotta be somebody that the world wants me to be
I was crazy, I was losin’ it
Cocaine in my body, I’m abusin’ it
I’m gettin’ fucked up on Percocet
Just received a call, it was a death threat
If I gotta die today and there ain’t no other way
But shootin’ me down then
Puttin’ me up in the grave
Then I’mma face it
Look the shooter in his eyes
The one who can save me is the man in the sky
The one pullin’ the trigger is the devil in disguise
For my children’s sake I’m tryna be alive
I’m a beast in the streets I know how to survive
All my life I been doubted
Will I see 25? I doubt it
Rolls-Royce bitch just know I just bought it
I just wanna be the man for my fam
I been through pain I walk in the the rain
I look at my reflection up in the mirror and I can admit that I feel so ashamed
I’ve done some dirt that I cannot forget
I’m wipin’ the blood, I’m wipin’ my sweat
The reason I killed him cuz’ he posed a threat
I got some sons and I got a daughter
You playin’ with me there’s gonna be a slaughter

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t wanna live my life like this no more
I don’t wanna sell this dope
The streets got me so fuckin’ paranoid
I don’t know what I’mma do
I’mma be a gangster forever
Ain’t no love in the streets
And I don’t trust you

[Chorus]
I'm facing my demons
That evil, I've seen it
The money, the root of all evil, believe me
You rob, you steal, you pop a pill and you kill
Everytime I need paper this is the way that I feel
My brother told me do it for my nephew
Bullets hit your body, now you leaving the rescue
One thing I know for certain, everytime you try to change, the devil's gonna come and test you
My brother told me do it for my nephew
Bullets hit your body, now you leaving the rescue
One thing I know for certain, everytime you try to change, the devil's gonna come and test you

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to change my life for the better
If I went to jail would they write a letter
Would they even care, if I wasn't there
It feels like I got haters everywhere
Haters, suckers, mother fuckers
I was built like no other
It's a cruel word, they criticize your skin color
Mobbin', robbin', homicide for something that makes them feel alive
I'm always curious to find out where I'ma go when I die
People hate me all the time but they ain't even met me yet
I was born to win in last so that ain't somethin' I'ma sweat
I came up off of sellin' that dope
Have you ever had the cops break down your door
Have you ever had the cops put you on the floor and rob all of your dope
No, you don't know, how that feels
You're totally broken and ready to kill
You're praying to god, asking for a deal, "Oh lord, I can't afford a meal"
I just want to go legit
I just feel like a piece of shit

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t wanna live my life like this no more
I don’t wanna sell this dope
The streets got me so fuckin’ paranoid
I don’t know what I’mma do
I’mma be a gangster forever
Ain’t no love in the streets
And I don’t trust you

[Chorus]
I'm facing my demons
That evil, I've seen it
The money, the root of all evil, believe me
You rob, you steal, you pop a pill and you kill
Everytime I need paper this is the way that I feel
My brother told me do it for my nephew
Bullets hit your body, now you leaving the rescue
One thing I know for certain, everytime you try to change, the devil's gonna come and test you
My brother told me do it for my nephew
Bullets hit your body, now you leaving the rescue
One thing I know for certain, everytime you try to change, the devil's gonna come and test you
