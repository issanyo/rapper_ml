[Intro: Michael Jaay]
What up, Stitches?
Check me out though

[Verse 1: Michael Jaay]
These niggas actin' too patient
And these bitches actin' too basic
Now this young nigga in the makin'
Too high, nigga feelin' too high
Mind as well pull up on a spaceship, ho
Nigga, I'm gone, fast lane but no road
Got a gram of trees in my backwood and my wrist lookin' too gold
Stitches hit me, he in the city, we wildin' out, let's go
Ain't fuckin' with these hatin' niggas, we gettin' straight to that dough

[Hook x2]
I ain't got no time and time ain't got no patience
The fast lane is my life, it's feelin' like I'm racin'
I need it right now, I'm impatient
Only white faces, I'm racist
If shorty over here, she ain't basic
Niggas finna get it while you waitin'

[Verse 2: Stitches]
I ain't got no time, for pussy niggas that's hatin'
Just know I got gorillas that will feed ya ass to the gators
See me I'm 'bout my paper, TMI Gang my squad
You'll be lucky if you get robbed
I'm a dope boy, I'm a street nigga
I'll leave you dead on the street, nigga
I don't care about no charge
I got three lawyers and they'll beat it all
It's a triple fee
But that shit ain't nothin' to me
Money come, money go, I'm a motherfuckin' G

[Hook x2]
I ain't got no time and time ain't got no patience
The fast lane is my life, it's feelin' like I'm racin'
I need it right now, I'm impatient
Only white faces, I'm racist
If shorty over here, she ain't basic
Niggas finna get it while you waitin'
