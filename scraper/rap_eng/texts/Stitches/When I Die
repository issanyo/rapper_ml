[Verse 1]
Depression hurts
I don't know what can help
You lose your mind and start talking to yourself
Waiting on a record to blow
Just so you could take care of your family
And stop selling the dope
Yeah, it ain't no secret
My mind's fucked up
So to ease up the pain I get fucked up
Problem after problem
How do I slove em'?
Suicidal thoughts
I'm talking to my revolver
I don't really know who the fuck to trust
I shed so many tears but Imma gangsta bruh
I got a wife and she the love of my life
I'm on the tour and she's alone at night
Temptation every city that I go to
Which one of these girls am I bout to go through
Make the right decision Stitches
Don't do it
We all got problems and we all go through it
Only time I forget is when I make music
After the studio it's right back to it
Driving my foreign under the influence yeah
Yeah, we all go trough it

[Hook x2]
Pain, struggle, just hustle
And don't stop
When I pray to God I look up to the top
Cause when I die I'll be a memory
When I die will you remeber me?
Keeps going on one person dies
One comes along and on and on

[Verse 2]
I contemplated suicide
I was losing my mind even thinking bout homicide
Holding my anger
Gun in my hand I'm about to cause danger
I fed on my life just living on a island
And my three children and my wife just smiling
As a father I don't ever wanna fail
And have my children visit me up in a cell
Am I going to heaven or am I going down to hell
All the answers to my questions only time can tell
Take the pain away
When I pop a pill
Trust issues and my pride keep me from signing a deal
Cause if I fucked up over somebody getting killed
So when you see me when you look at my eyes
Just know your in the presence of somebody who is real
Matter of fact fuck you and fuck your record deal

[Hook x2]
Pain, struggle, just hustle
And don't stop
When I pray to God I look up to the top
Cause when I die I'll be a memory
When I die will you remeber me?
Keeps going on one person dies
One comes along and on and on
