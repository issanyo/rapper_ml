Sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean, what?
Sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean, whoo
Sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean,  lean
Everyday of my life I'm sippin the lean
Sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean,  lean
Sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean,  fool
Sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean
Everyday of my life I'm sippin the lean

[Verse 1]
Pour up a four of the hi tek and that dome soda
Pull out the pound baby girl you know that I'm a stoner
Mixing qualy with the act like baking soda
No way I'm drinking this lean, I might end up in a coma
The other day I saw my momma she said Stitches you leaning
When I run out of codeine, I swear to god I be feening
A pussy peep just pull me over and asked me if i'm sippin?
Nigga you know that I'm sippin
Cuz if not I'm gonna be drippin
My doctor just told me that I got the Bronchitis
A pint of that hi tek he just prescribe it
I'm leaning, I'm leaning
I'm leaning, I'm leaning

Sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean,  lean
Sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean,  fool
Sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean, sippin lean
Everyday of my life I'm sippin the lean

[Verse 2]
Floor seats at the heat game sippin the lean
I don't drink liquor, I drink the lean
Rest in peace Pimp c, he was drinking the lean
They told me to stop sippin
But I'm still sippin lean
My dowg [?] he got the Hi tek
And the qualitist, the pound
Ngp and the activis
Bought it with pints and extendo clips
