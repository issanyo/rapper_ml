[Hook]
I walk through the airport with kilos in my bag
Kilos in my bag, kilos in my bag
I walk through the airport with kilos in my bag
Kilos in my bag, kilos in my bag
Fuck the police, I got kilos in my bag
Fuck the police, I got kilos in my bag
Fuck the police, I got kilos in my bag
Kilos in my bag and the cockpit is my stash

[Verse 1]
How many kilos do you want?
I can fly right to your city if you want
I'm breakin' off the pilot and breakin' off a TSA agent so I can fly with drugs when I want
Fuck the police
Fuck 'em
Imma do what I want
Smoke weed on a plane if I want
Take a bump on the plane if I want
I get high off my own supply
I'm sellin' drugs 'til the day I die
I run the streets, I run the sky
My kilos up in the streets, my kilos up in the sky
The cartel, I'm connected with them
El Chapo, he's my friend
Free Big Meech and Guzman

[Hook]
I walk through the airport with kilos in my bag
Kilos in my bag, kilos in my bag
I walk through the airport with kilos in my bag
Kilos in my bag, kilos in my bag
Fuck the police, I got kilos in my bag
Fuck the police, I got kilos in my bag
Fuck the police, I got kilos in my bag
Kilos in my bag and the cockpit is my stash

[Verse 2]
I just did a show in Chicago
Cops came up in that bitch, took me to jail
They put me up in that room and they told me they found a brick and a scale (Fuck 'em!)
No you didn't, no you didn't
Don't try to set me up cause that case Imma win it
Dirty cops, dirty cops, man, I gotta kill 'em
They sent you in for protection then serve into a victim
You ain't gon' catch me slippin', never
I shoot you with my AK, whatever
When you see me up in person you gon' take a shit
Ain't no hesitation in my blood, I just let it rip
I just let it rip
I just let it rip
I just let it rip
HAHA!

[Hook]
I walk through the airport with kilos in my bag
Kilos in my bag, kilos in my bag
I walk through the airport with kilos in my bag
Kilos in my bag, kilos in my bag
Fuck the police, I got kilos in my bag
Fuck the police, I got kilos in my bag
Fuck the police, I got kilos in my bag
Kilos in my bag and the cockpit is my stash
