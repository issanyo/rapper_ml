[Hook]
When they put you in the chain gang, they forget you
When they put you in the damn grave, they forget you
Put your face up on a white tee
Explain to me how that's respect to me
I want a statue like the Liberty
And I can care less if you fuck with me
The only thing that matters to me
Is if my kids remember me
When they put you in the chain gang, they forget you
When they put you in the damn grave, they forget you
Put your face up on a white tee
Explain to me how that's respect to me
I want a statue like the Liberty
And I can care less if you fuck with me
The only thing that matters to me
Is if my kids remember me

[Verse 1]
Nobody's your friend, nobody's got your back
I cut all them fakes off and I ain't lookin' back
I swear to God these niggas is some leechers
Can't even buy your own burger, nigga, you should be speechless
This shit is not direct this shit right here for everybody
My own family turn they back on me, I trust nobody
So ask yourself a question, do you think I fuck with you?
Fuck your weed, fool, I don't wanna smoke with you
I'm always sittin' in the room thinkin' 'bout who's real
Who's really got your back, who's really ready to kill
I came to a conclusion, everybody fake
They swear on they mama and lie to your face

[Hook]
When they put you in the chain gang, they forget you
When they put you in the damn grave, they forget you
Put your face up on a white tee
Explain to me how that's respect to me
I want a statue like the Liberty
And I can care less if you fuck with me
The only thing that matters to me
Is if my kids remember me

[Verse 2]
What would you do if you was in my position?
Who would you trust? Loyalty is a must
All my friends keep dyin', both of my brothers in the prison
My mama always cryin', cause I'm the only one left
So if them feds take me in, it's a hundred on they head
Tell me if you know 'bout pain, tell me if you know 'bout struggle
Tell me if you know 'bout cancer in your mama's throat, lil whoadie
This shit right here is serious, and if you fuck with my squad I get furious

[Hook]
When they put you in the chain gang, they forget you
When they put you in the damn grave, they forget you
Put your face up on a white tee
Explain to me how that's respect to me
I want a statue like the Liberty
And I can care less if you fuck with me
The only thing that matters to me
Is if my kids remember me
When they put you in the chain gang
Put your face up on a white tee
I want a statue like the Liberty
The only thing that matters to me
Is if my kids remember me
