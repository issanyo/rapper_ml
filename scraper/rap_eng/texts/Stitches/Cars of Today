Cars today are like kids in a way
If it falls apart you can give it away
The dirt's been ground in from the places iv'e played
Its which way to go
The funnels ive chosen are to skinny to change

These are the cars of today
We wear clothes and we drive cars
These are the cars of today
We're so disposable

Cars today are like kids in a way
They'll be here forever never go away
The dirt's been ground in from the places iv'e played
Its which way to go
The funnels i've chosen are to skinny to change

These are the cars of today
We wear clothes and we drive cars
These are the cars of today
We're so disposable

Be here forever never go away
Cars of today
