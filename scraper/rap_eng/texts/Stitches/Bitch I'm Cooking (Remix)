[Hook: Stitches]
Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me
Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me

[Verse 1: Stitches]
Your boyfriend's a joke, your boyfriend is broke
Come fuck with Stitches, I got kilos on my boat
She sayin', "Stitches, I love you"
I think my diamonds make her crazy
First day she met me, say she wanna have my baby
I'm smokin' weed, I'm sippin' lean
Pull up in a Maserati up to the scene
TMZ takin' pictures, while I'm rollin' these swishers
Gettin' head while I'm drivin', and best belive I still kiss her
She say, "Stiches you too freaky for me"
To tell you the truth, I'm startin' to think that bitch is an informant
She's askin' way too many questions
Imma Chris Brown that ho, teach her a lesson
Slap that bitch two times and tell that bitch to get to steppin'
Imma always be rich, they call me, "Mister Steal Yo Bitch"
Now that boy say he got a problem
I got a AK-47, Imma solve it

[Hook: Stitches]
Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me
Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
I don't get tired, young nigga straight gettin' it
Face card on the ceilin', Billboards on buildings
Front page for killers, project we dealin'
Haitian told me I could have three but I still came back with it
Fucked up, Goddamn, Gates, you a real, yeah, street nigga
Disrespect me one time, man, then you know I got to beef with ya
Broad day pullin' walk downs, you ain't walkin' 'round in the city
Bodies poppin' up everywhere, leavin' chalk around in the city
Catch me stadin' in kitchen, straight drop, no weapon
Money commas at the money house, got the clique house still clickin'
Bad bitch with a big booty, tattooed up, big titties
Make shorty hit the booty club, I ain't wanna dance, I tip her
Break down these strippers (Break down these strippers)
[?] on the flip phone, gotta holla at the lieutenant
Two soft, got one hard, I can front one, four chickens
Back from Puerto Rico, movin' that perico

[Hook: Stitches]
Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me
Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me
