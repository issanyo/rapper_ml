[Hook]
I can't sleep at night, I got withdrawals
Sweatin' on my body, I got withdrawals
I can't sleep at night, I got withdrawals
Sweatin' on my body, I got withdrawals
I need some more drugs in my system
I need some more drugs in my system
I need some more drugs in my system
I need some motherfuckin' drugs up in my system

[Verse 1]
I can't sleep at night cause I ain't got no drugs no more
Call up my drug dealer, come and bring drugs to my door
And if he ain't got drugs, then pimpin', I'm gon' cut your throat
Cut your body up in pieces and just throw it off a boat
When it comes to my drugs, they say I'm crazy
When it comes to my money, you better pay me
I got them goons on speed dial
They kill yo ass right quick and I just smile
Sippin' lean, poppin' percs, poppin' xanax
Drivin' foreign cars up in Miami, that's where I am
Stay strapped up, pimpin'
It ain't nothin' to catch you and your niggas slippin'

[Hook]
I can't sleep at night, I got withdrawals
Sweatin' on my body, I got withdrawals
I can't sleep at night, I got withdrawals
Sweatin' on my body, I got withdrawals
I need some more drugs in my system
I need some more drugs in my system
I need some more drugs in my system
I need some motherfuckin' drugs up in my system

[Verse 2]
I'm about to go in, Imma rob a pharmacy
Cause I ain't got no motherfuckin' narcotics next to me
I'm a drug addict, I gotta have it, my life exclusive
Look at everything that Stitches doin', I'm a bad influence
I got a hundred [?] in my fridge
I been sippin' lean since a little kid
I'll rob you for all of your drugs
Even if I'm loaded up with drugs
My mama say I'm grimey cause I rob everybody
My mama say I'm grimey cause I'll catch a body
I do anything for them drugs
Including empty out all of my slugs

[Hook]
I can't sleep at night, I got withdrawals
Sweatin' on my body, I got withdrawals
I can't sleep at night, I got withdrawals
Sweatin' on my body, I got withdrawals
I need some more drugs in my system
I need some more drugs in my system
I need some more drugs in my system
I need some motherfuckin' drugs up in my system
