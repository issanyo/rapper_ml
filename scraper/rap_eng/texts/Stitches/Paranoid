Lately I've been cryin'
Cause I feel like im dyin'
They shake your hand
They say they love you
You Know that they lyin'

I've been feelin' paranoid
I've been feelin' paranoid
I've been feelin' paranoid

[Verse 1]
A gangsta once told me
Look in your rear view mirror
Make sure the coast is clear
Especially if u got haters
They hate to see u winnin'
Hate to see u stack that paper
They look at u they say they love u
You know these are hater
I see right through your eyes
I see right thorugh your lies
I'm the one that u despise
I know u hate on me God
Listen dawg, I'm that boy
I sell coke and I ain't gon' stop
Yeah I make music
But that's my cover up to keep sellin' them rocks
I ain't got friends no more
I had to cut them all off
Both of my brother are callin' me from the prison
Tellin' me to take off
I tell em I got ya when you hop right out
You gon drive a foreign car
Ridin' with your little brother
He became a superstar
Everything happened so fast (So fast)
All this motherfucking cash (Money)
And I know when i got in the rap game
They used to say Stitches ain't gon last

Who's your friend
Who is not
Who's gon' ride with you to the top
Shit get real, get real when the feel
I didt it on my own screaming fuck a record deal

Lately I've been cryin'

They shake your hand
They say they love you

I've been feelin' paranoid
I've been feelin' paranoid
I've been feelin' paranoid

[Verse 2]
I learn a lot everyday of my life
Your best friend will try to take your life
Hate trend is a horrible disease
I'm prayin' on my knees, askin' God please
Did I do wrong, did I do right
Are you mad at me for sellin' drugs through the night
Are you mad at me for pouring up this pint
I need you now to help me through this fight
Do you understand the pain i go through
All the prayers that I'm saying, I'm making it to you
I know you died for our sins should I die for you
It's a cold ass world but it don't feel cool
I do this shit for my brothers
I do this shit for my kids
It was all a dream but it turned to reality
Friends said i changed from fame now they mad at me
Did I change or are you just lame
Are you the fake motherfucker that was causing me pain
Tellin' me that you love me just to gain some fame
Just to make a name, just to make some change
It's a dirty game, its a dirty game
And this dirty world gon' remain the same

Paranoid
Paranoid
Paranoid

I'm paranoid everyday of my life
Cause I know I got some hater trynna come take my life
Trynna kill me and come to my funeral
It'll prolly' be your best friend in your casked he will hold
