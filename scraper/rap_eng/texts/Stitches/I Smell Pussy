[Intro]
Pussy, pussy
I smell some pussy
Pussy, pussy
I smell some pussy
I smell some pussy
I smell some pussy
I smell some pussy
I smell some pussy

[Verse]
First off I know who you is
I'm the type of nigga to go take your kids right from they school
Don't make a nigga like Stitches go and act a fool
You ain't no blood, you ain't no crip
They call you The Game, I call you bitch
And when you come to Dade County I promise yo wig gon' get split
I know bloods, I know crips, I know GD's too, my nigga
The word around California is you pay for protection, nigga
You claim to be the hardest
Hit you in your face, now you lookin' retarded
Dead body in a duffle bag, I swear to God, it smells like I farted
You ain't never seen no dope and you ain't never flipped no brick
You used to be a stripper, pussy nigga, dancin' like a bitch
He mad cause I put him on blast
Fuck around with me, I put my foot in ya ass
You don't want problems with a savage
Fuck around with me and these bullets you can have it
I raise havoc, you's a faggot, and that shit to me is tragic
And you might have a gun, pussy nigga, but mines automatic
I come creepin' up in yo house, pistol whip you up in yo mouth
Ain't no cameras around, and my gun don't make a sound

[Outro]
So let me know, pussy nigga, do you really want war with a nigga like me? I ain't sure, you lil bitch ass nigga, always rollin' with a entourage cause you insecure, I know the truth about you, you's a ho, pussy ass nigga, and I mean everything I say so stop the interviews and come see ya nigga and throw them hands cause I promise it's gon' end up like 2Pac and Biggie, fuck nigga
