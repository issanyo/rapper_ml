[Intro: Stitches]
TMI Gang, fool!

[Hook: Str8 Kash]
If you know a hater, put ya hands up
Let me at 'em, let me at 'em, let me at 'em
We gon' tear this club up
Let me at 'em, let me at 'em, let me at 'em
Pussy, I see you, nigga, you a pussy
I can't fuck with you, you's a pussy
I'm a drug dealer, you's a rookie

[Verse 1: Str8 Kash]
Cocaine, what a beautiful pain
It can turn my brain that makes Str8 Kash feel oh-so strange
Turn into a psycho, [?] battle
I'm feeling like a [?]
My [?]
As I go all my way down the [?] alley
I be actin' childish, but fuck it, we all dyin'
Imma loud when I'm on fire
Yeah, I'm sellin' that Mariah
Can it be that bone crusher, nigga, you don't want the drama
Get your pie in thirty minutes, boy [?]
Don't compare me to these rappers, I ain't in they genre
You niggas a dyin' breed, I'm here to make this interestin'
Bring you back to eighties, nineties, baby, get the triple Beam
Bloody red, [?], yellow tape, that be that murders
50k [?], doctor [?] me for my surgery
Guns for you [?],  I am just so mental
These rappers ain't shit, I'd rather hear their instrumentals

[Hook: Str8 Kash]
If you know a hater, put ya hands up
Let me at 'em, let me at 'em, let me at 'em
We gon' tear this club up
Let me at 'em, let me at 'em, let me at 'em
Pussy, I see you, nigga, you a pussy
I can't fuck with you, you's a pussy
I'm a drug dealer, you's a rookie

[Verse 2: Stitches]
I'm the drug dealer of the year, diamonds on my ear
Diamonds on my wrist, diamonds on my pinky ring, bitches blowin' the kiss
Know what I'm about, put that work on yo block when you're goin' through a trial
I make one phone call and they'll take your life, nigga, don't have a doubt
If he wants a problem, let me at him
If he thinks he's 'bout that life, let me at him
My fans will come and get ya, I'm a leader but no Hitler
Got a chopper and a bazooka, ask about me, I'm a good shooter
I got four granades up in my book bag
They say, "Stitches was psychotic", put me in rehab
I love the smell of somebody's blood
I love to taste somebody else's blood
I wish that I was lyin' in the song
But the shit that goes through my mind is fuckin' wrong
Let me at 'em, let me at 'em, let me at 'em
Let me at 'em, let me at 'em, let me at 'em
Let me at 'em, let me at 'em, pussy nigga

[Hook: Str8 Kash]
If you know a hater, put ya hands up
Let me at 'em, let me at 'em, let me at 'em
We gon' tear this club up
Let me at 'em, let me at 'em, let me at 'em
Pussy, I see you, nigga, you a pussy
I can't fuck with you, you's a pussy
I'm a drug dealer, you's a rookie
