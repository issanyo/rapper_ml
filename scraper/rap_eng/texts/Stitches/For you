(chorus)

I sell cocaine at night
I do this shit for you
I put my life at risk
I do this shit for you

I go through so much pain
I do this shit for you
I do this shit for you

I sell cocaine at night
I do this shit for you
I put my life at risk
I do this shit for you

I quit doing them drugs
I do this shit for you
I do this shit for you

( verse 1 )

Thinking about the time i ain't gotta sell
Thinking about the time that we doing well
Thinking about the time i ain't gotta put
My life at risk and end up in a damn cell
Anybody that said he love selling drugs
Is a idiot and is try'na be a thug
I'm paranoid 24/7 , cos the feds wanna
Catch me slipping
I'm drinking lean straight outta pint
My wife telling me that i'm tripping
Its incredible i ain't overdosed yet
No hurt feelings death on my bed
See , me i face reality , look
That's why i never let this fame get to me
The point is to become a legend and
Leave a mark on this world
Ain't know one forgetting me

The way i work my wrist
I do this shit for you
I'm dodging the police
I do this shit for you

I met my plug in mexico
I do this shit for you
I'll kill somebody for ya
I'll do that shit for you

(Chorus)


( verse 2 )

Hard times makes me wanna grind harder
Mistakes in my past wanna make me smarter
I said it together forever and i mean it
This love is a one in a millions so respect it
Temptations in every city that i go to
Not one of those pussies that i go through
I'm on the road making hits with a pro tools
14 years old i said fuck school
Mama told me chase your dreams
I started sell'in clean
It was love at first sight with cough syrup
I fell in love with codeine

Both of my brothers in prison
I do this for you
I love my wife and kids
I do this shit for you


* see everyday i take a motherfuck'in risk
Leaving my house , flipping this work
But i'mm a tell you something right now
You could never get to the level you
Want to be at if you don't take a risk
So forever its gonna be FUCK A JOB ! TMI GANG
I DO THIS SHIT FOR YOU ! I LOVE YOU !!!

( chorus )
