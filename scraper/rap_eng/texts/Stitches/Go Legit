Supply and Demand production

[Hook:]
I don't now, what I'm doing no more
I try so hard, but It still ain't working
And I just wanna be, a legend in these streets
And always have a way to provide for my family
If you seen what I seen you wouldn't belive in dream
Fuck this fame and this money
Everything ain't what it seems

[Verse :1]
Ouhhh
Put your hands in the air if you came up from the bottom
Drinking at the bottles cause you go into some problems
I just wanna buy new house for my moma
Yeah I making money but this money bring me drama
Times get hard just make sure your keep your head up
Only times  he loves you when you poppin and bread up
Felling paranoia cause I know I got some haters
Try'na cach me sleeping try'na kill me from my paper
Look at me I'm a G and you can't fuck with me
Everybody is fake in the streets
Is telling me they love me when honestly they don't know me
I think they just wanna clone me
I'll take me out of this game
You told me they love me you got my back and you put a bullet in my brain
All my ennemies, I wish you wear
I'm getting money, I'm doing well
I got nothing to say
I make a million a day

[Hook:]
I don't now, what I'm doing no more
I try so hard, but It still ain't working
And I just wanna be, a legend in these streets
And always have a way to provide for my family
If you seen what I seen you wouldn't belive in dream
Fuck this fame and this money
Everything ain't what it seems

[Verse 2:]
This money do me nothing if they lock you in a prison
If they take you away from you kids and they take away your pigeons
I'm driving on the highway thinking 'bout the betters days
I'm tired of selling drugs I'm try'na find an other way
I-I look foreign cause I love bad bitches
I stay true to my dogs I'ain't never switchin
I wanna go on a jet, I wanna go on a jet
Shoutout to my father you're biggest pices of shit
I did it on my own, I did it on my own
I hope you thinking about me when you're home alone
This sex will be something that you remember
You say he did good I did it better

[Hook:]
I don't now, what I'm doing no more
I try so hard, but It still ain't working
And I just wanna be, a legend in these streets
And always have a way to provide for my family
If you seen what I seen you wouldn't belive in dream
Fuck this fame and this money
Everything ain't what it seems

[Outro:]
I don't now, what I'm doing no more
I try so hard, but it still ain't working
And I just wanna be, a legend in these streets
And always have a way to provide for my family
If you seen what I seen you wouldn't belive in dream
Fuck this fame and this money
