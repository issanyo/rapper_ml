[Chorus: Stitches]
All my enemies are gon' get murdered, murdered, murdered
All my enemies are gon' get murdered, murdered, murdered

[Verse 1]
Ride 'round town with my nine out
Tee top looking like time out
Lil' bad bitch 'tryna ride out
I don't give a fuck if they find out
Ride 'round town with an AK
Spend half a day in the damn bank (swish)
Only thing I care bout is gettin' cake
Or whether or not 'dem titties shake (jiggling)
Top shipped away I wake n' bake
Stay makin' all these bank plays
A little compression on the delay
Stitches pass the blunt like a relay (turn up)
Met yo bitch on the tour bus
You know yo bitch had to tour us (mad)
Takin' LSD like she in Europe
All I wanna see is that skirt up

[Chorus: Stitches]
All my enemies are gon' get murdered, murdered, murdered
All my enemies are gon' get murdered, murdered, murdered

[Verse 2]
I was gassed up like a '87 Chevy
Came crashing down like a New Orleans levy
I already knew they were fuckin' with it heavy
I was pissed off and that .45 heavy
Grip so tight my palm sweaty
Look at my homie like, "y'all ready?"
I'm the definition of half man half drugs
Poster-child for re-rock, ask the plug
The spliff ain't stuffed, just re-rolled
Extra tucked, I got an extra gun
Hit a lick and run, post it up
Like Marcus I'll post it up
Add 'em all, run them rocks Di'Angelo Hall
Yeah I stand my money tall
Always move when that money call

[Chorus: Stitches]
All my enemies are gon' get murdered, murdered, murdered
All my enemies are gon' get murdered, murdered, murdered

[Verse 3]
Stay makin' heavy deposits down in the tropics
New Death Row wish a nigga would come and try and stop it
If the G cost too much we gotta cut it
If they bring artillery, rush it
If the police at my door, flush it
Stuff the duffel watch the hustle
Watch me turn around and make double
Need keep silent when we cuddle
Talk too much watch me intercept a bundle
Jim you up on the interstate switch cars switchin' plates
Why you in place
Bitch this a robbery (yah)
Bitch don't bother me (yah)
Bitch I keep the heat on me when I'm on easy street

[Chorus: Stitches]
All my enemies are gon' get murdered, murdered, murdered
All my enemies are gon' get murdered, murdered, murdered
