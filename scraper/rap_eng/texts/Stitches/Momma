(Cash Money AP)

[Intro/Chorus]
Momma, I stole some money from your purse
I say, Momma, I did some things and they hurt
I say, Momma, I know I lied to you a lot
But Momma, my love for you won't ever stop
I say, Momma, I stole some money from your purse
I say, Momma, I did some things and they hurt
I say, Momma, I know I lied to you a lot
But Momma, my love for you won't ever stop

[Verse 1]
I brought my momma drama
I brought my momma pain
I did a lot of things
Made my momma go insane
I brought my momma a lot of shame
Ain't no sun, only rain
I feel so guilty about it
It stay stuck up in my brain
They call me a delinquent, but it's the truth
Confessions of my life up in the booth
I say the truth; I keep it real
Before I started flipping, boy, I had to steal
I stole from momma
Momma, I'm sorry for everything that I did to you
Yes, I'm sorry
And I can't take nothing back that I did wrong
But momma I love you, that's why I made you this song

[Hook 1]
Momma, I stole some money from your purse
I say, Momma, I did some things and they hurt

[Chorus]
Momma, I stole some money from your purse
I say, Momma, I did some things and they hurt
I say, Momma, I know I lied to you a lot
But Momma, my love for you won't ever stop
I say, Momma, I stole some money from your purse
I say, Momma, I did some things and they hurt
I say, Momma, I know I lied to you a lot
But Momma, my love for you won't ever stop

[Verse 2]
I was 14 years old; I moved out the crib
I started flipping weight, now I'm paying the bills
Now her son got a deal
Now her son got a Porsche
She asked me for a Porsche
I said, "Momma, yeah, of course!"
You had my back; now I've got yours
We own these houses; fuck a landlord
I love you, Momma, I know you love me too
I've got to thank God everyday for having you
Without you, there's no Stitches
I love you, Momma; fuck them other bitches
See, we family; we got the same blood
Your son is a thug, and he got it out the mud
I love you, Momma

[Hook 2]
Momma, I stole some money from your purse
I say, Momma, I did some things and they hurt
I say, Momma, I know I lied to you a lot
But Momma, my love for you won't ever stop

[Chorus]
I say, Momma, I stole some money from your purse
I say, Momma, I did some things and they hurt
I say, Momma, I know I lied to you a lot
But Momma, my love for you won't ever stop
Momma, I stole some money from your purse
I say, Momma, I did some things and they hurt
I say, Momma, I know I lied to you a lot
But Momma, my love for you won't ever stop

[Outro]
I say, Momma, I stole some money from your purse
I say, Momma, I did some things and they hurt
I say, Momma, I know I lied to you a lot
But Momma, my love for you won't ever stop
