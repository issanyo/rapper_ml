[Intro]
Hahaha!
Fuck a job!
Money, money, pussy!

[Hook x2]
I'm fuckin' bad bitches, Dan Bilzerian
Naked bitches on my plane, Dan Bilzerian
Foreign whips, big cribs
I'm rich as shit, I'm like Dan Bilzerian

[Verse 1]
Naked bitches on my plane, but it ain't nothin'
White tee, Jordans on, bitch, I'm always stuntin'
Two bitches, Cuban and a Russian
I'm a rich motherfucker, end of discussion
Bitches callin' me life savior
Cause I got all the party favors
I was a drug dealer
But I had to go legit cause the cops always follow a nigga
Now I'm livin' life
And I'm gettin' sucked off by a bitch who got the same name as your wife
Cocaine make her crazy
Now she tellin' me she want me to give her ass a baby

[Pre-Hook]
I got Dan Bilzerian money
I got Dan Bilzerian money
All you haters really so funny
Imma get sucked off while I count my money

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I got a lot of guns up in my house and a million dollars in cash
Instagram famous, hoes always shakin' they ass
In my mansion, drinkin' liquor
Pop the molly, snortin' cocaine, nigga
I'm just smokin' weed, though
Cause on my tour, I swear to God, I snorted a kilo
Now I gotta lay low
Cause the popo tryna catch me slippin' with the coco
Hop up on the boat
And go wherever the fuck I want
Fuck you and your feelings, boy
I know the truth, you wish that you could be a motherfuckin' dope boy

[Pre-Hook + Hook x2]
