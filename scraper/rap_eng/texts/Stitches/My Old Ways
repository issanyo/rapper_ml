[Hook]
If this rap shit don't work
Then it's back to drug dealin'
If this rap shit don't work
Then it's back to drug dealin'
Drug dealin'
I'm goin' back to my old ways
I'm goin' back to my old ways
I used to flip fifty kilos everyday
Until I got run up on by the DEA

[Verse 1]
If the rap don't work then it's back to flippin' coco
Only reason I stopped flippin' coco cause I got three kids, bruh
I don't want my children to visit me up in the prison
So I used my drug money and I made myself famous
And the streets know I'm real so they all gon' respect me
Only thing I ever trust, it was this chopper to protect me
And it's TMI Gang, fool!
To think that you can fuck with us you is a fool!
If the rap don't work then it's back to drug dealin'
Ask about yo boy Stitches in the drug game I done killed it
And my nigga El Chapo finally free
So I might just re-up on them fuckin' ki's

[Hook]
If this rap shit don't work
Then it's back to drug dealin'
If this rap shit don't work
Then it's back to drug dealin'
Drug dealin'
I'm goin' back to my old ways
I'm goin' back to my old ways
I used to flip fifty kilos everyday
Until I got run up on by the DEA

[Verse 2]
The way I'm feelin' lately, man, I do not give a fuck
If they tryna lock me up then they is all gon' get shot up
It really ain't nothin' to find out where a pussy pig lives
And if you fuckin' with my business then I'm fuckin' with ya kids
I'm a nightmere in Dade County, nigga, and it is a fact
Take it as a compliment if I tell you her ass is fat
I'm a horny ass nigga and my dick is always hard
Especially when I'm flippin' cocaine up on the boulevard

[Hook]
If this rap shit don't work
Then it's back to drug dealin'
If this rap shit don't work
Then it's back to drug dealin'
Drug dealin'
I'm goin' back to my old ways
I'm goin' back to my old ways
I used to flip fifty kilos everyday
Until I got run up on by the DEA
