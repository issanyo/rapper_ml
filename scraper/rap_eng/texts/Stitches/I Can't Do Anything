Here I am
The walking contradiction
I guess I like the feeling of friction
I never pull through with the things I should
Just sitting around eat another Quaalude
I don't mind being the world's ashtray
Cause I only feel lucky when I'm losing the race
I can't do anything right
Why can't I do anything right
