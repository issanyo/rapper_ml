[Chorus]
I’m a real street nigga, and you'se a fake ass nigga
Ain’t never sold dope nigga, you a pussy ass nigga
You a pussy ass nigga, y’all some pussy ass niggas
You a pussy ass nigga, I’m a real street nigga

[Verse 1]
Diamonds in my grill boy, I might leave you blind
Cocaine in my car, and the police tryna find it
Fuck the police, and fuck them K9 dogs too
Coffee beans and a vacuum seal nigga what can you do
I’m a professional drug dealer
And I make music for all of my thug niggas
Free all of my niggas in the chain game whoadie
I’m always gonna scream free all of my homies

[Chorus]
I’m a real street nigga, and you'se a fake ass nigga
Ain’t never sold dope nigga, you a pussy ass nigga
You a pussy ass nigga, y’all some pussy ass niggas
You a pussy ass nigga, I’m a real street nigga

[Verse 2]
All my niggas riders, I’m a drug supplier
White tee, jordans on nigga and I’m driving
Bricks in the back boy, in a pillow sack boy
If they try to pull me over, I'mma catch a case boy
I ain't going in boy, it’s gonna be life boy
They gonna try to put me in there for my whole life boy
I don’t wanna rot in no prison, I’d rather be dead
And when I find out who snitch on me, that boy gonna end up dead
Fuck Young Jeezy, fuck Tyga and The Game
Fuck around with me nigga, I put bullets in your brain
You just woke up a monster, you was just some imposters
The truth always come, remember that homie

[Chorus]
I’m a real street nigga, and you'se a fake ass nigga
Ain’t never sold dope nigga, you a pussy ass nigga
You a pussy ass nigga, y’all some pussy ass niggas
You a pussy ass nigga, I’m a real street nigga
