[Intro]
HAHAHAHA!
TMI Gang, fool!

[Hook]
She don't want no broke nigga (Nah!)
She just want a drug dealer (Yayo!)
She don't want no broke nigga (Nah!)
She just want a drug dealer (Stitches!)
I'm a drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer
I'm a drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer

[Verse 1]
(Stitches!)
I was born a drug dealer
I was born a thug nigga
Cocaine done changed my life, baby
This cocaine that I got will drive you crazy
These fuck niggas owe me money and need to pay me
If not, you gonna have to buy some choppers and need to spray me
Ask around the hood, I'm good
I can go in any hood I want cause I am good
My face is clean, nigga
They say I'm mean, nigga
They say the A1 perico I got is mean, nigga
It cook back, nigga
It jump back, nigga
I got your girl suckin' my dick and my ballsack, nigga
I'm rubbin' cocaine on her clitoris
My dick inside her mouth, I'm 'bout to bust
My rifle's only thing I trust
And if you play with my money I bust

[Hook]
She don't want no broke nigga (Nah!)
She just want a drug dealer (Yayo!)
She don't want no broke nigga (Nah!)
She just want a drug dealer (Stitches!)
I'm a drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer
I'm a drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer
I'm a drug dealer

[Verse 2]
I'm servin' out the El Camino
My customers call me a hero
I'm tired of all these fake rappers
The bitch you with right now, nigga, I had her
She say she love you but she is a actor
I gave that bitch some molly and she turned to a professional dancer
My drug so good, she fell in love
The man she got, that nigga is a scrub
He say he was a drug dealer
He told that bitch he was a thug nigga
I'm laughin' at these fake niggas
Cause all they money Imma take, nigga

[Hook]
She don't want no broke nigga (Nah!)
She just want a drug dealer (Yayo!)
She don't want no broke nigga (Nah!)
She just want a drug dealer (Stitches!)
I'm a drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer
I'm a drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer, drug dealer
I'm a drug dealer
