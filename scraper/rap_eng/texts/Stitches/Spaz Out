[Hook]
Don't make me spaz out
Don't make me spaz out
If I don't fuck with you, fool
Don't put your hand out
Don't make me spaz out
Don't make me spaz out
If I don't fuck with you, fool
Don't put your hand out

[Verse 1]
I ain't got no friends 'cause I don't trust nobody, nigga
If you ever try to test me, I'ma catch a body, nigga
TMI Gang, fuck yo' squad, what you reppin'?
If you ain't affiliated with me, boy, then get to steppin'
I snap my fingers and my gorillas gon' getcha
We got bomb money, lawyer money, drug money, fool!
And I never graduated, I was screaming, "Fuck the school!"
I was always a leader
Got codeine and a two-liter
And hell yeah, boy, I fucked your bitch, best believe I'm gon' eat her
Eat the booty, eat the pussy up, I suck her toes, I get real freaky
She bouncing up on my dick, I swear to God I thought the bitch was tweakin' (God damn!)
Haha! Stitches stole yo' bitch, fool!

[Hook]
Don't make me spaz out
Don't make me spaz out
If I don't fuck with you, fool
Don't put your hand out
Don't make me spaz out
Don't make me spaz out
If I don't fuck with you, fool
Don't put your hand out

[Interlude]

[Hook]
Don't make me spaz out
Don't make me spaz out
If I don't fuck with you, fool
Don't put your hand out
Don't make me spaz out
Don't make me spaz out
If I don't fuck with you, fool
Don't put your hand out
