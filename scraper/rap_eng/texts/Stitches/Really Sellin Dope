[Hook]
If you really sold dope then why you askin' for front?
If you really sold dope then why you askin' for front?
I'm a rich motherfucker, eatin' lobster for lunch
I'm a rich motherfucker, eatin' lobster for lunch
If you keep it real with me, I might brought you some keys
I'm connected everywhere, my work come from overseas
I'm the plug, but there's no outlet
White T, Jordans on, that's my outfit, fool

[Verse 1]
When I was fifteen years old I made my first million dollars
Independent young nigga and I should thank my father
He was ghost to me, nigga but that shit didn't bother
So I had to be the bigger man and put racks in his head
Me and you, boy, we can't relate, we got a different story
I done living in a fishing scene but now my crib too story
And I hate these fake rappers tryna claim that they real
Just because you rap about dope that shit don't mean that you real
But you know I'm puttin' dope up in your baby's diaper
And what you know 'bout fuckin' a bitch but really you don't like her
I use that bitch as my mule, she drives my bricks from Mexico
And I know it's a dirty game but this how the game goes
