[Hook]
I just want put a smile on your face
We been through some pain
Baby let's escape
You thought it was the end baby it's ok
I just want to see you happy
Even for one day
Look into my eyes
I guarantee you'll see
Pain and misery
Just put your trust in me

[Verse 1]
Just hold my hand
And I could take all of your pain away
Trust in your man
And I could guide you to a better place
This life a sin but I could promise you a better way
Relieve the stress
We looking forward to a brighter day
What you know about them pills up in my cabinet?
What you know about my problems and my damages?
What you know about my problems with my management?
What you know about my stress and anger management?
When you look in my eyes you see a hustler
When you look in my eyes you see the misery
I'm just flipping up to provide for my family
A good man but the law still after me

[Hook]
I just want put a smile on your face
We been through some pain
Baby let's escape
You thought it was the end baby it's ok
I just want to see you happy
Even for one day
Look into my eyes
I guarantee you'll see
Pain and misery
Just put your trust in me

[Verse 2]
I'm having nightmares
Barely getting sleep at night
I done some dirt
I done some wrong
I'm trying to get it right
Pour up a cup open
All of my problems fade away
Follow my lead
Let's take a trip we need to get away
What you know about flipping weight in the streets?
What you about putting your heart in these beats?
What you know about them late nights selling whites?
What you know about them killers coming in the night?
When you look in my eyes you see a hustler
When you look in my eyes you see the misery
I'm just flipping up to provide for my family
A good man but the law still after me

[Hook]
I just want put a smile on your face
We been through some pain
Baby let's escape
You thought it was the end baby it's ok
I just want to see you happy
Even for one day
Look into my eyes
I guarantee you'll see
Pain and misery
Just put your trust in me
