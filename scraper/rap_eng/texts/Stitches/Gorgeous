I'm so gorgeous, I really think I'm gorgeous

I'm so gorgeous, these bitches think I'm gorgeous
Smokin' good, man, it's lookin' like the forest
I'm so gorgeous, I give it across the border
I'm so gorgeous, got bitches down in Georgia
It's so gorgeous how my pockets get enormous
It's so gorgeous that these bitches get [?]
It's so gorgeous, man, I'm ballin', [?]

[Verse 2: Stitches]
I pull up in the Ghost
Just made a million now let's make a toast
Money's all I fuckin' need
I make these bitches get up on they knees
TMI Gang 'til the death of me
Cocaine is always next to me
It's in my socks, it's in my pocket
I'm a drug dealer, baby, been 'bout my profit
What's your name? I don't give a fuck
I'm tryna put some cocaine in your butt
[?], up in that telly
She's screamin', "EI, EI, EI", like she Nelly

[Verse 3: Rude]
Imma tell a fat ho that she gorgeous
Big girls need love, that's important
I don't give a fuck who know this
I'm in front the mirror doin' poses
Nigga, pockets lookin' lovely
Haters lookin' so disgusting
All my bitches certified stuntin'
(All your bitches ugly)
I just smoked a whole pound of indo
I need to quit that shit, it started from the get-go
A nigga never met a bitch who couldn't turn into a ho
And that's the motherfuckin' truth
