[Hook]
Call me up, and put some drugs in yo body
Call me up, and put some drugs in yo body
Call me up, and put some drugs in yo body
And for these hoes, I snort that coke of your body

[Verse 1]
Call me up, and come get some narcotics
I got kilos, bitch, I'm from Dade County
My squad like BMF
Throw so much narcotics that these cops tryna arrest
I love my squad and I am screamin', "Fuck the rest!"
I'm so damn famous that my name up in the press
My haters they depressed
I got my strap up on your chest, bullets go through a vest
I am a person that I guarantee that you don't wanna test
Boy, you ain't gon' survive, cause you ain't 50 Cent
And I'll still kill yo ass if you owe me fifty cent

[Hook]
Call me up, and put some drugs in yo body
Call me up, and put some drugs in yo body
Call me up, and put some drugs in yo body
And for these hoes, I snort that coke of your body

[Verse 1]
That bitch ain't your shorty, I make her get naughty
She suckin' this dick so damn much that my dick is throbbin'
Put some cocaine in my coffin
Even then my clients callin'
TMI Gang, fool!
All those shots I be callin'
Lamborghini's, Ferarri's
I run this game no Atari
I'm takin' a line off of her belly, so the bitch call me "Papi"
Blow, blow, she want my blow, blow
Drug dealing's all I know, ho
I put cocaine up in her butthole

[Hook]
Call me up, and put some drugs in yo body
Call me up, and put some drugs in yo body
Call me up, and put some drugs in yo body
And for these hoes, I snort that coke of your body
