Verse 1:
I get some drugs by all the mistakes that I made in the past
The scariest part of this rap game is how long Ima last & be counting that cash
I look in the mirror I see fear in my eyes
Every time I smile I’m telling a lie if I’m being honest I wanna cry man I wanna die
I was a kid, I was a child, every decision I made it was wild
I got some haters they want me dead hopefully I never make them smile
Who’s my friend who do I trust
I trust god that’s my dawg
Am I a bad person just because I fucked up & I broke the law
No I’m not I got a heart I’ll admit that I wasn’t smart
I had a role in the movie they saw something
But then I lost my part, yeah it hurt, it made me feel like a piece of dirt
But every time I tried nothing ever worked
Chorus:
Look who I’ve become
Look at what I’ve done
I feel so numb
Life isn’t fun
I’m on a mission all by myself I think I need help the only reason that you didn’t know is ‘cause I keep it to myself
The only reason that you didn’t know is ‘cause I keep it to myself
Verse 2:
Listen to these lyrics
I need help, I need help
Lately I been suicidal, thinking ‘bout killing myself
I pray to god, show me the way
Show me the light I’m a thief in the night
If you ever ask for my advice, I’ll probably tell you that everything would be alright
But the truth is I don’t even believe the words that are coming right out of my mouth
Money the root of all evil, I’m thinking of burning my house down, down to the ground when no one’s around
My mind, my body, my soul is lost & they all know where to be found, maybe they’re just out of town
I hope I see them again, I’m losing all of my friends
Yeah I sin but I repent, they don’t know what I have been
Yeah I did a lot of evil, yeah I did a lot of evil, but when I make music like this song I make it for the people
Chorus:
Look who I’ve become
Look at what I’ve done
I feel so numb
Life isn’t fun
I’m on a mission all by myself I think I need help the only reason that you didn’t know is ‘cause I keep it to myself
The only reason that you didn’t know is ‘cause I keep it to myself
I need help, I need help, I need help I said I need help, I need help, I need help, I need help, I need help, I need help
The only reason that you didn’t know is ‘cause I keep it to myself
