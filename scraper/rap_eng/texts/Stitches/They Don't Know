They don't know what I've been through
They don't know what I had to do
They get it here, I came up from the bottom
They get it here, I made real bad decisions
They don't know what I've been through
They don't know what I had to do
They get it here, I came up from the bottom
They get it here, I made real bad decisions

[Part 1]
It was in these years, I had to grind myself
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust myself
Lotta people is haters, they wanna see you fall
They prayin' everyday for your downfall
It's a dirty game but fuck it
I'mma get my money, my ducking
Bitch, shut the fuck up and suck it
My drug dealer name: McLovit
I rerock a brick, turn one into two
I turn ten into twenty nigga, this is what I do
And I ain't [?] girl but I'm flippin' them chickens
Keep on whippin' and flippin' and upgrade how you was livin'

They get it here, I made real bad decisions
They don't know what I've been through

[Part 2]
Twenty years old, I'm whippin' dope everyday
I came up off sellin' eight-eight
Sellin' weed wasn't high because I wanted to smoke it
And I promise you this game ain't nothin' to joke
This shit get serious, don't ever cross your plug
You wanna sell bricks, fool, better be a thug
It's a risk everyday, paranoid when I drive
I know I got some haters and they don't want me alive

[Hook]
They don't know what I've been through
They don't know what I had to do
They get it here, I came up from the bottom
They get it here, I made real bad decisions
They don't know what I've been through
They don't know what I had to do
They get it here, I came up from the bottom
They get it here, I made real bad decisions
