[Verse 1]
I get perico from Puerto Rico, I feed my people
I sell perico, it is illegal
I got to do it for my family, fuck the police
I'm a beast in the streets
I've been through pain, I've been through struggle
Been locked up a few times, but a nigga still hustle
You asked me 'es cocaine?'
Swear to God, it's the best
I can turn it into crack

[Verse 2]
My plug in Colombia got pot
My plug in Mexico, he got shot
I pull myself to Puerto Rico when I met a connect
And now we got a young nigga in Miami on deck
I got fifty over hunnid and two-hundred and fifty
I can shoot you now in front of to you like I was 50
And if you don't understand what I'm saying, boy you retarded
I'm smoking on that loud pack, I swear it smells like [?]
