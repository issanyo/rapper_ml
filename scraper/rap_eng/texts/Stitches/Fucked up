[Hook]
Police trynna lock me up, man, it's fuck up
Both my brothers in the prison, man, it's fucked up
Momma crying, it's emotional, it's fucked up
To take my problems away, I have to get fucked up

[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning
White tee on, them Jordans on
Put it on, smoking strong
Selling that crack, i know that it's wrong
Momma calling me her son a delinquent
I shoot you down right quick
Dont worry what im thinkin' uh
Never panic, pop a XANAX
I never panic
I know you panic, like you on the boat that caused Titanic
Im fuckin' a bad bitch and yeah bitch
I speak Spanish
I'm a Cuban, smokin' Cuban, bitch i do this
Mafia I run it TMI Gang I'm claimin' motherfuckers
You tellin' that i know singing
Workin' with feds, writing statements, they confidential
Inform me, pussy confidential inform me!

[Hook]
Police trynna lock me up, man, it's fucked up
Both my brothers in the prison, man, it's fucked up
Momma crying, this emotion always fucked up
To take my problems away, I have to get fucked up

[Verse 2]
Flippin' dope in my Ferrari
Poppin' pills in a Ferrari
Play with me i ain't Atari, you gon' die it's the safari


[Hook]
Police trynna lock me up, man, it's fuck up
Both my brothers in the prison, man, it's fucked up
Momma crying, this emotion always fucked up
To take my problems away, I have to get fucked up
