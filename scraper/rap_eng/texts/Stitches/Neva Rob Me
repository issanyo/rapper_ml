[Hook]
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
I always keep some choppers 'round me, 'round me
I always keep some shooters 'round me, 'round me
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
I always keep some choppers 'round me, 'round me
I always keep some shooters 'round me, 'round me

[Verse 1]
You can never rob me, you can never rob me
I used to rob dope dealers, nigga as a hobby
Rob and they give me yo chop in my body
Fuck the police, nigga they can never stop me
When you a boss you pay the cops off
Me and my squad taking off
They can't, nigga that's my city
I'm snorting cocaine off a titty
These industry niggas don't like my music, fuck 'em
Any rapper in this industry, I can rob him
Nigga, you don't want a problem
I'm the definition of a problem

[Hook]
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
I always keep some choppers 'round me, 'round me
I always keep some shooters 'round me, 'round me
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
I always keep some choppers 'round me, 'round me
I always keep some shooters 'round me, 'round me

[Verse 2]
Shout out to my drug dealers
Shout out to my thug niggas
All my niggas robbin', robbin'
I tell 'em to go, they start robbin'
I'm the realest rapper that you ever heard
I'm a real street nigga, man of my word
If you a real nigga, put your hands up
If you a drug dealer, put your hands up
Never leave my crib without my strap and that's a fact
AK-47 and if not I use my MAC
You better take your chain off
You better take all of your juice off

[Hook]
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
I always keep some choppers 'round me, 'round me
I always keep some shooters 'round me, 'round me
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
Nigga, you can never rob me, rob me
I always keep some choppers 'round me, 'round me
I always keep some shooters 'round me, 'round me
