[Verse 1]
Boy, you ain't no drug dealer
Boy, you ain't no thug, nigga
Talkin' about robbin' Stitches
And you gettin' a slug, nigga
Pop-pop-pop to the graveyard
See your mama crying at the graveyard
I'm a nightmare up in Dade County
Police wanna put me up in the county
Nineteen years old, drivin' a Maserati
Facial tattoos but a young nigga ballin'
And I'm screamin', "Fuck yo feelings!"
In this drug game, I made a killing
If DEA comes in my house
Best belive I ain't gon' open my mouth

[Verse 2]
I got work for the low, I'm a drug dealer
I got cocaine cause I'm a drug dealer
I got too many hoes, I'm a drug dealer
Free cocaine if they suck dick, nigga
I'm laughing to the bank
[?] cause I know the pussy stink
That's old news, that's old pussy
I'm in the club with some new pussy
Sippin' codeine, I'm a codeine fiend
If I'm in the building, cocaine's on the scene
Painkillers in my system
I tell my boys to kill 'em and yeah, they killed 'em
They tryna hit me with the R.I.C.O
I just came back from Puerto Rico
In my suitcase got the perico
Fuck FBI, fuck DEA
You got a job, I'm sellin' yay
TMI Gang, my family!
