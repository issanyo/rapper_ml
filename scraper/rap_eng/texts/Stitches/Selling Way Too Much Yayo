[Intro]
HAHAHAHAHAHA!
Yayo
Haha!

[Hook]
Yayo
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(My baby mama trippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(Police tryna catch me slippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
I can't stop
Yayo
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(My baby mama trippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(Police tryna catch me slippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
I can't stop

[Verse 1]
I'm talkin' yayo, white
But I don't need a scale
I won't get no bail
If they run up in my crib
Fuck the police
On the microphone you know I am a beast
I'm a beast up in the streets, with them keys
I take forty bricks up to the keys
You know I'm taxin', you know I don't drive for nothin'
Lot of these fuck boys hatin' on me cause I'm stuntin'
(These jewels!)
Stay strapped up with a Shotgun, with a UZI, or the AK
Extendo's on every gun, boy, it's mayday
Push Life Alert when you see me
That piece of shit on the TV
Panic, boy, panic, boy
Cause you goin' down like Titanic, boy
But this song 'bout that yayo
I got the yayo
If I am your drug dealer, you'll never fail

[Hook]
Yayo
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(My baby mama trippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(Police tryna catch me slippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
I can't stop
Yayo
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(My baby mama trippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(Police tryna catch me slippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
I can't stop

[Verse 2]
Met my plug in Mexico (Jos√©!)
Brought two birds with the pregnant ho
I love TSA cause they make it too easy
Break them off with that guap
They act like they ain't seen me
I'm good at cookin' in the kitchen
I love the way that I am livin' (That money!)
I'm tired of all these pussy snitches
Actin' like they know 'bout Stitches
Yayo, I send it to you through the mail (UPS)
It's whiter than some mayo
And I never leave a trail
I can't stop

[Hook]
Yayo
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(My baby mama trippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(Police tryna catch me slippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
I can't stop
Yayo
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(My baby mama trippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
(Police tryna catch me slippin')
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
I can't stop

[Outro]
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
Yayo
I'm sellin' way too much yayo
I can't stop
