[Verse 1]
A better man, A better plan
I have some demons in my head, they want me dead
Every time that I think about a better life
In a paradise, I can feel the devil tryna take my life
And my childrens lookin me like I’m the best father
I started treatin' women better, when I had my daughter
I just wanna be remembered as a legend when they put me in a grave
Lifes a gamble, roll your dice
Cuz it can happen anyday
Thank God for another day
Now on the stage, I’m out the cage I make my family happy
The tables turn, people learn and we got my haters dancin'
Misery looks company I just opened my new company
And i know it’s sound so crazy but I see God right in front of me

[Hook]
I remember times that I never had shit
The way it happen make me belive in magic
If you see what i seen you wouldn’t believe in dreams
It feels like yesterday that i was selling to a fiend
Momma proud I jump in the crowd they don’t know me back then but they know my name now
Let it be you will see, this the story of a G
Everytime you think of givin' up just take a look at me

[Verse 2]
You go through pain, so do I
You hide your tears, it's ok to cry
Momma proud, I make momma smile
Momma said she feel blessed to say that I'm her child
Every decision you made live your life with no regrets
I stop doing all those drugs wakin' up I got the sweats
I remember the time that I was on the run
Thank God for my blessings I just threw away my gun

[Hook]
I remember times that I never had shit
The way it happen make me belive in magic
If you see what i seen you wouldn’t believe in dreams
It feels like yesterday that i was selling to a fiend
Momma proud I jump in the crowd they don’t know me back then but they know my name now
Let it be you will see, this the story of a G
Everytime you think of givin' up just take a look at me

[Verse 3]
All my life i wanted to be the greatest
When i die put me on the hollywood pavement
Drinking liquor, my visions blurring
You going through problems it will be alright, don’t worry

[Hook]
I remember times that I never had shit
The way it happen make me belive in magic
If you see what i seen you wouldn’t believe in dreams
It feels like yesterday that i was selling to a fiend
Momma proud I jump in the crowd they don’t know me back then but they know my name now
Let it be you will see, this the story of a G
Everytime you think of givin' up just take a look at me
