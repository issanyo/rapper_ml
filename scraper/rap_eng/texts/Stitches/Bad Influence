I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm poppin' percs, I'm pourin' lean, I'm smokin' weed
I'm poppin' percs, I'm pourin' lean, I'm smokin' weed
I'm poppin' percs, I'm pourin' lean, I'm smokin' weed
I take bump when I need to wake up, I be turnt up

[Verse 1]
I pop a perc, I pop a xanax, I pour some lean, smoke some weed
Take a bump to wake up if I'm fallin' asleep
You know my life real crazy, you know I be turnt up
And if you don't like me, nigga, I don't give a fuck
Send me your address, pussy nigga, and I'm down to pull up
And when it comes to aimin' that gun just know I got that good luck
But fuck that beef shit, nigga, I'm tryna get fucked up
How much I made today sellin' cocaine? A million, bruh
I slice a kilo down the middle and take a bump
The lifestyle of drug lord, I live it, bruh
I can see jealousy in your eyes
Because my lifestyle is what you despise
I just opened up my fridge, I got a hundred [?] in there
Ain't no food up in my fridge but I got narcotics in there
Got a pound of that kush and a kilo of that coco
To say you live like Stitches, nigga, you must be a [?]

[Hook]
I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm poppin' percs, I'm pourin' lean, I'm smokin' weed
I'm poppin' percs, I'm pourin' lean, I'm smokin' weed
I'm poppin' percs, I'm pourin' lean, I'm smokin' weed
I take bump when I need to wake up, I be turnt up

[Verse 2]
How many drugs I did today? A lot
Lamborghini and a 'Rari in my fuckin' parkin' lot
Gold cuban link chain on my neck, Rolie on my wrist
Hatin' on that boy Stitches, why? Cause I'm Mister Steal Yo Bitch
Take your bitch for a ride in my foreign whip
She up in the passenger seat and she 'bout to suck my dick
Before I let her suck my dick, my weed she has to twist
And I ain't fuckin' that bitch if that pussy smell like fish
I'm talkin' [?], my vocabulary got no filter
And I smoke four blunts everytime I take a shit, bruh
And I always keep a gun on me, homie
Ain't no friendships in this game but this chopper is my homie

[Hook]
I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm a bad influence, I do a lotta drugs
I'm poppin' percs, I'm pourin' lean, I'm smokin' weed
I'm poppin' percs, I'm pourin' lean, I'm smokin' weed
I'm poppin' percs, I'm pourin' lean, I'm smokin' weed
I take bump when I need to wake up, I be turnt up
