[Intro: Stitches]
Brick Bible, motherfucker!

[Hook x2: Stitches]
I'm the trapper of the year, yeah
Trap star, trap star
I'm the trapper of the year, brrr
Trap star, trap star
I'm the trapper of the year, aye
Trap star, trap star
I'm the trapper of the year, fool
Trap star, trap star

[Verse 1: Stitches]
Everybody wanna be a trap star
Everybody wanna buy a foreign car (SKRR!)
Everybody wanna buy them diamond jewels
I did it on my own and I ain't go to school (No college)
I'm 'bout to open up a drug dealin' school
And if you wanna be a drug dealer, I'm taxin' you (Fool!)
Here, fill out an application
To be a drug dealer it takes determination (Real talk)
This shit don't happen overnight, it takes some patience
But crime pay, I promise
I can teach you the definition of ballin' (Money)

[Hook x2: Stitches]
I'm the trapper of the year, yeah
Trap star, trap star
I'm the trapper of the year, brrr
Trap star, trap star
I'm the trapper of the year, aye
Trap star, trap star
I'm the trapper of the year, fool
Trap star, trap star

[Verse 2: Str8 Kash]
Callin' Kash a trap king, rollin' with some bad bitches
Nina on my waist, that middle finger to the police
Nigga, pour some more lean, women, roll some more weed
If them niggas talkin', catch a bullet, end your story, hey
Nigga, bow down to the trap god
Bitches like my diamonds, watch out for them sirens
Kash been the king, I been the ruler, catch a shooter
(Know some chicos around my way, they comin' straight from Cuba)
They dyin' for respect, all they know is violence
Wake up in the mornin', load the Glock before they on it
Don't compare me to these rappers, I ain't in they genre
Get yo pie in thirty minutes, boy, Jimmy [?]
These niggas ain't fly, straight right here we call them [?]
I'm in my Maserati, put some [?]
I ain't sold yet, nigga, that's a white line
I been in the streets, with them killers, and it's do or die

[Hook x2: Stitches]
I'm the trapper of the year, yeah
Trap star, trap star
I'm the trapper of the year, brrr
Trap star, trap star
I'm the trapper of the year, aye
Trap star, trap star
I'm the trapper of the year, fool
Trap star, trap star
