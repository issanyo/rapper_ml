You people dont understand
Theres one little thing that make somebody loose their mind
And Im about to loose mine

I got too many problems
Tell me how do I solve them
I could loose my mind or I can keep control
But if I loose my mind
I might hurt somebody
If I loose my mind
I might kill somebody

You in the presence of a gangster
Presence of a drug dealer
Ain't no loyalty left in this world
Im bout to pull the trigger
Popping pills
Forget about it
What pill am I popping baby
Im popping xanax
I got too many problems girl
But I don't care no more
Im about to grab my AK47 and shoot through that door
Im outta my mind
Im outta control
Fuck everybody
All of you gonn get a bullet hole

I got too many problems
Tell me how do I solve them
I could loose my mind or I can keep control
But if I loose my mind
I might hurt somebody
If I loose my mind
I might kill somebody

Lord I don't wanna live life no more
Lord I don't wanna sell dope no more
All these damn thieves keep calling my phone
All the police keep watching my home
I put you on you turn your back on me
Aight
Playing around with a killer
Aight
When you least expect it you get shot down in the night
I know killing an old friend of mine really isn't hard
Im just tired of the betrayal
All I do is keep it real
I take you away from the scale
When you got to jail I post bail
Talk to me Lord
Talk to me Lord
Lord Lord Lord

I got too many problems
Tell me how do I solve them
I could loose my mind or I can keep control
But if I loose my mind
I might hurt somebody
If I loose my mind
I might kill somebody
