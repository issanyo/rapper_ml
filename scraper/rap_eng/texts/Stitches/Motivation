[Chorus]
The cars, the clothes, the hoes, the cribs
I wanna buy a different area code
I just bought a Rolls Royce and now I want a Lambo
The more money you make, the more money you spend
I just wanna be a gangster and I'm ballin' to the end
Growin' up I would look at my momma and tell her "I want it all"
I remember the days that I was window shopping at the mall
The more money you make, the more money you spend
I just wanna be a gangster and I'm ballin' to the end

[Verse 1]
Cold-hearted, I'm heartless, I don't trust none of these fools
They know I go the hardest, turn your back on me that's cool
I been chewed up, spit back out, got knocked down, got back up
, they shot me up, if I die today you think I give a fuck?
I ain't like none of these rappers, your favorite rapper's an actor
Be careful what you say on that phone 'cause the Feds probably just tapped you
