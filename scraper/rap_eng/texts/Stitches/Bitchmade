[Intro: Richie Stackin]
Stitches, we gon' have to get 'em, these boys bitch made, Richie Stackin and Stitches, Florida boys in the house, we killin' all you bitch made, they hatin', man, keep stack

[Hook: Stitches]
You bitch made, talkin' shit behind my back
You bitch made, you gon' talk to my strap
You bitch made, talkin' shit behind my back
You bitch made, you gon' talk to my strap
Pussy, you is a pussy
When you walk by me, I smell some pussy
I let my gun do the talkin'
Fuck with me, you ain't gon' be walkin'

[Verse 1: Richie Stackin]
Ain't nothin' but a bunch of bitches
I'm chillin' with my dog Stitches
We in the Rolls Royce talkin' business
Bunch of bitches, takin' pictures
Brick in yo face, got em itchin'
El Cubano, flippin' chickens
Talk shit, leave ya ass missin'
Bring the whole toast, bring the whole kitchen
Florida boy got ammunition
Bustin' out that expedition
Lil mama send a text message
I told the bitch, hold on a second
Hundred carats all in my necklace
Got my codeine straight from Texas
Three blunts, that's just for breakfast
Weed game, I'm well connected
Got a condo with a fish tank
Yo boy got that big bank
I'm all about my Ben Frank's
Blowin' up, Hussein
Shoot down ya plane like Ukraine
You bitch made, what you sayin'?
I ride the track like two trains
My dog love sellin' cocaine
(I LOVE SELLIN' BLOW!!!!!!!!!)

[Hook: Stitches]
You bitch made, talkin' shit behind my back
You bitch made, you gon' talk to my strap
You bitch made, talkin' shit behind my back
You bitch made, you gon' talk to my strap
Pussy, you is a pussy
When you walk by me, I smell some pussy
I let my gun do the talkin'
Fuck with me, you ain't gon' be walkin'

[Verse 2: Stitches]
My best friend is my strap, fuck with me and you get clapped
My name is Stitches, you know that, I sell cocaine and crack
My name be up in the stats, cocaine fly through the map
My name should be "Crack", yo re-rock is wack
I'm in love with cocaine (Straight up!)
I'm in love with my rifle (And I'll shoot you!)
They say, "That boy Stitches a psycho"
My bitches naked when they baggin' up
Ain't no hoes gon' steal from us
TMI Gang, my family, all my niggas will die for me
I supply cocaine in the streets, and I merk these beats

[Hook: Stitches]
You bitch made, talkin' shit behind my back
You bitch made, you gon' talk to my strap
You bitch made, talkin' shit behind my back
You bitch made, you gon' talk to my strap
Pussy, you is a pussy
When you walk by me, I smell some pussy
I let my gun do the talkin'
Fuck with me, you ain't gon' be walkin'
