[Hook: Pretti Sly & Stitches]
All these suckers hatin' cause a nigga always stackin' paper
Police pull me over, got a million in my briefcase, nigga
Askin' where I got this money from, it ain't your business, nigga
TMI Gang, we drivin' foreigns, it ain't nothin', nigga

[Verse 1: Stitches]
Pull up in a Maserati, all white like that coco, nigga
They say Stitches crazy, in Spanish they say I'm loco, nigga
I'm a drug dealer and my nigga Sly, he pimpin' bitches
White Forgiatos on our car, oh yeah, we stuntin', nigga
Who gon' tell us something? Nobody could never tell us shit
How you supposed to give advice when you can't pay your bills, lil bitch
My money do the talkin' for me, I don't like to talk a lot
Everywhere that I pull up my name is up on that parkin' spot
I'm screamin' fuck a record deal cause I don't need one
I'm screamin' fuck your favorite rapper, I don't see him
I ain't got no competition, homie, I swear to God
It's TMI Gang, fool, we screamin' fuck a job

[Verse 2: Stitches & Pretti Sly]
When I got famous these boys they stared actin' funny, nigga
When I got famous your bitch she started actin' lovely, nigga
The tables turn, niggas learn, bitches learn
She used to brush me off now she wanna take my clothes off
I just bought a Rolie and this shit rose gold
Don't play around with my squad, we don't ever fold
I love girls with big booty, I love girls with big tities
First day she let me hit it, I fucked her once and that pussy quited, oh God
They want me to fail, they want me to fail
They want me to fail, they want me to fail
Book me up in jail, lock me in a cell
Book me up in jail, lock me in a cell
