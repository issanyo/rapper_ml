Feelin' like a winner
I said I'm feelin' like a winner
Feelin' like a winner
I said I'm feelin' like a winner
Feelin' like a winner
All them bitches in my section, aye
Feelin' like a winner
All them bitches in my section, aye

[Verse 1: Stitches]
I said I'm feelin' like a winner, Lord knows I'm a sinner
Sippin' lean, poppin' percocets and that's for dinner
Ten bottles of champagne at my table
Ask about the boy Stitches, money real stable
You say you gettin' money but you can't pay your cable
I eat your girl's booty like a pancake, no maple
I motorboat her titties, my cum is on her titties
And I don't want that pussy if everyday I can't hit it
If you fuckin' Stitches, baby, you's a winner

[Hook: Str8 Kash]
Feelin' like a winner
I said I'm feelin' like a winner
Feelin' like a winner
I said I'm feelin' like a winner
Feelin' like a winner
All them bitches in my section, aye
Feelin' like a winner
All them bitches in my section, aye

[Verse 2: Str8 Kash]
If you feelin' like a winner put your hands up in the sky
I'm killin' that pussy, I don't need an alibi
All these bottles in my section, all these hoes, I impress 'em
Baby, Kash is always sexy, let me teach that ass a lesson
But no cuffin'
I take your bitch, my nigga, it ain't nothin'
Cuban papi ridin' Maserati, poppin' wheelies on Ducati
I'm the life of the party, put some life in your body
TMI Gang, fool!

[Hook: Str8 Kash]
Feelin' like a winner
I said I'm feelin' like a winner
Feelin' like a winner
I said I'm feelin' like a winner
Feelin' like a winner
All them bitches in my section, aye
Feelin' like a winner
All them bitches in my section, aye
