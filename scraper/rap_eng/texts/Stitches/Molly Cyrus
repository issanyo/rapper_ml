Fuck Billy Ray Cyrus, I'm your daddy now
Imma put my dick up in your ass and it ain't comin' out
If you don't like what I'm sayin' now, I don't give a fuck
Cause it won't change the fact that my dick is in your butt
My cocaine will make you numb
So Imma put it in your ass with my thumb
It's time to get freaky, Miley Cyrus
We can have a baby and call him Stitches Cyrus (HAHAHA!)
I'm a demented motherfucker
Imma fuck Miley Cyrus in front of her mother
I love cocaine, cause it got me feelin' like I'm Superman
I could've chose Nicki Minaj, I could've chose Iggy Azalea
I could've chose Jennifer Lopez, but I'm fuckin' Miley Cyrus!

[Verse 2]
I can't pay your bills, Miley Cyrus, but you can pay mine
But one thing that I got for you, is cocaine all of the time
I'm a drug dealer, baby, you gon' be a drug dealer's lady
Cocaine make a bitch go crazy, cocaine make a bitch go crazy
