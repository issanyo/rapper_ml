[Hook: Stitches]
I pull up on them at the red light
BRRRRR, flatline, BRRRRR, flatline
I pull up on them at the red light
BRRRRR, flatline, BRRRRR, flatline

[Verse 1: Vice]
West coast to east coast, that's my connections
Down south of the very bottom, welcome to my section
Section eight housin', Glock for protection
Send yo ass up north for the disrespectin'
I don't got two chains, but I got two Glock's
Picture me rollin' in that Benz like 2Pac
Let the whole clip fall, who shot ya?
Notorious, like Big Poppa
Break 'em off proper
Propellers on the chopper like a fuckin' helicopter
Bury my enemies in the graveyard
Mel Gibson with his lethal weapon
I'm a braveheart
Who the fuck wanna go to war?
Leave you knockin' on heaven's door
Who the hell wanna feel the pain?
Catch a murder one but I kill the game

[Hook: Stitches]
I pull up on them at the red light
BRRRRR, flatline, BRRRRR, flatline
I pull up on them at the red light
BRRRRR, flatline, BRRRRR, flatline

[Verse 2: Stitches]
I keep my chopper in my backseat
I wish somebody would tell me I won't shoot this heat
I don't need no concealed weapons license, boy
I'll shoot yo mom, yo daddy, yo whole family, boy
This ain't no game, boy
This ain't Monopoly
Everybody up in every hood respectin' me
Cause I'm a fuckin' G
And you ain't none to me
You say you wanna a feature from Stitches
Well, that shit ain't free
What's goin' on in your fuckin' mind?
Tellin' all of your people we related all the time
Quit tellin' fuckin' lies
Cause they gon' catch up to ya
And I'm a motherfucker
My bullets, they 'bout to hit ya

[Hook: Stitches]
I pull up on them at the red light
BRRRRR, flatline, BRRRRR, flatline
I pull up on them at the red light
BRRRRR, flatline, BRRRRR, flatline

[Verse 3: Str8 Kash]
These boys they think they rowdy
Put four holes up in that nigga like a Audi
Smoke a blunt and then I'm outtie
Str8 Kash, flashin' shots like paparazzi
Sellin' bricks like T. Montana
Molly like I'm Hannah
[?] in Saint Louis, I call it [?]
TMI gorillas and them choppers got bananas
Pull up at the red light and I'll shoot you with this hammer
She like, "Why you got to kill him?"
BRRRRR, class is over, I dismissed him
Yeah, we ruthless with Rugers
And now our body [?], we don't pay no shooters

[Verse 4: Vice]
[?] be schemin'
See them haters lerkin'
Give them nothin' but pain and rain
See them haters hurtin'
[?] my team
See them haters workin'
Sell 'em nothin' but dreams
We on the corner servin'
Keep that brick chop
'Til we get in to the tip top
Never flip flop
On my teams that he hits drop
Keep that fifth cocked, with that beam
If the shit pop, on the block like clockwork
Let you see how that Glock work
Thinkin' y'all bulletproof
'Til you feel how that shot hurts
Silly bitch, who the fuck you think you playin' with?
Trustin' these hoes, be careful who you layin' with
Loose lips and shits
So I ain't sayin' shit
Askin' me all them questions
Imma plead the fifth
