[Hook]
I'm A1, since day 1 (4x)

[Verse 1]
You ain't the person that you claim to be (Fake boy!)
Do not compare, cause you ain't close to me (Will never be!)
A lot people say they friends of me (They never be!)
Not a day in they life have they met me (They never will!)
When you A1, people wanna know ya (A1)
If they ask who's my best friend, is my lawyer
My A1 bricks came from Montoya (Narcotics!)
Colombian that's [??] Montoya
My A1 leave 'em satisfied (Always!)
Yo shit ain't A1, you is falsified (Fake!)
If I sell yo ass a bag, keep [??]
You will not find this A1 nowhere else, better recognize

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm A1 like my bricks
My connect don't speak English
Hit my phone if you need this (I got it!)
I can send it to yo house, ho'
Cause I get it by the boatload
One hit, one hit, one hit
Now you got white mogos
Don't take too many hits, cause might [??] be deadly (Don't do it!)
If yo bitch [??] watch that pussy get friendly (She fuck!)
Don't bring your bitch around me, cause you might attempt me (Don't do it!)
Unless you gon' let me
You bitch will not regret me (Never!)
Everyday in my life is a party (You know it!)
I'm A1 like a Ferrari (Scrr!)
I'm A1 like a papi
