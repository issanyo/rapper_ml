You say you know how to cook it
Well, let me see you work your wrist
You say you know how to cook it
Well, let me see you work your wrist
It better come back, it better come back
It better come back, it better come back
I wanna see the whole thang jump back
It better come back, it better come back
It better come back, it better come back
And if it does not come back
I shoot yo ass with my strap

[Verse 1]
Listen up, lil homie, step in my trap
I can teach you how to turn cocaine into crack
Cause I'm a real drug dealer, fool
Word around my hood is that you went to private school
So I can't take you serious
I'm a shark up in this game and you is just a fish
I ain't the best rapper 'round, I don't give a shit
Why care 'bout rap money, nigga, when I'm flippin' bricks?!
And you's a broke nigga, dog, just look at ya kicks
Let me teach ya how to cook it in the kitchen, whoadie
And don't ever get confused, boy, you ain't my homie
Cocaine is my wife, cocaine is my life

[Hook]
You say you know how to cook it
Well, let me see you work your wrist
You say you know how to cook it
Well, let me see you work your wrist
It better come back, it better come back
It better come back, it better come back
I wanna see the whole thang jump back
It better come back, it better come back
It better come back, it better come back
And if it does not come back
I shoot yo ass with my strap

[Verse 2]
Everybody wanna be a drug dealer
Everybody claimin' that they that nigga
And when I walk up in the kitchen they don't know what to do
Cause I'm a professional at cookin', nigga, who is you?
You is a nobody, and me? Nigga, I am somebody, aye
I'm that boy that make that whole brick jump back on the stove
I'm a drug dealer in a drug dealin' mode
Why do I like sellin' drugs so much? Cause of the profit
It give me a rush in my body, and I can't stop it
I'm screamin' fuck the police at every show that I perform
These niggas is some hoes, let 'em know that I'm the devil

[Hook]
You say you know how to cook it
Well, let me see you work your wrist
You say you know how to cook it
Well, let me see you work your wrist
It better come back, it better come back
It better come back, it better come back
I wanna see the whole thang jump back
It better come back, it better come back
It better come back, it better come back
And if it does not come back
I shoot yo ass with my strap
