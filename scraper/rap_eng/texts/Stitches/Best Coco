I know what you came to my crib for
Word around town I got the best coco
You wanna be with a thug
I am a thug baby lets ride
You know what it is to be broke
Im bout to show you how it feels at the top
I know what you came to my crib for
Word around town I got the best coco
You wanna be with a thug
I am a thug baby lets ride
You know what it is to be broke
Im bout to show you how it feels at the top

[Verse 1]
I remember the days when they used to say I wouldn't be shit
But the tables turn they see me in person and ask for a pic
All of that hatred
All of that doubt
It just made me better
Talking shit about me to that bitch
I hope it make you feel better
I just keep moving that weight
Shipping it state to state
Riding with my AK 47
Cause these boys be fake
Then I keep trapping
Man I keep riding foreigns
All of these bitches
Showing their titties while Stitches be touring
Im in the back of that Rolls Royce
Bitch you know that Im a dope boy
Like Johnny Depp I sell blow boy
I prolly sell coke to your home boy

Word around town I got the best coco
You wanna be with a thug

Im bout to show you how it feels at the top

[Verse 2]
Bitch I know how it feels
I came up from the bottom
I can upgrade your life and put you in some red apple bottoms
I got some diamonds all up in my mouth
I just fucked your bitch we fucked on your couch
Marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy some molly all I talk about
How does it feel when Im up inside
How does it feel when you on the ride
Im fucking her fast
Im fucking her slow
She say I love you Stitches Im not a hoe

[Verse 3]
I know what you came to my crib for
Take your clothes off put that ass on the floor
You wanna fuck with a drug dealer
Then imma show you what Im bout
Imma put my dick in your mouth
And give you something that you can talk about
