When times get hard keep your head up
Flip that dope on the corner and get your bread up
Scream fuck all these haters cuz they ain't nothing
Pull up in foreign cars bitch yeah I'm stunting
When times get hard keep your head up
Flip that dope on the corner and get your bread up
Scream fuck all these haters cuz they ain't nothing
Pull up in foreign cars bitch yeah I'm stunting

[Verse 1]
I was tired of being broke so I started selling dope
Started buying lots of diamonds and jewelry for all my hoes
I remember dreaming of this when I was sleeping at night
But my dream became reality so now I'm living life
I used to rob, I used to steal, I used to sell lots of cocaine
Turned the negative to positive cuz now I got three children
And I don't want my children to visit me in the prison
When you at the top, who could you trust?
I always keep my chopper with me and it's ready to bust
Kill that boy real quick and burn his body, turn him to dust
But fuck these haters I'mma keep ridin', keep flippin' (flip, flip, flip, flip, flippin')
I heard they put a price tag on my head they wanna see me dead

When times get hard keep your head up

When times get hard keep your head up

Scream fuck all these haters cuz they ain't nothing
Pull up in foreign cars bitch yeah I'm stunting

[Verse 2]
I put my hood on it I ain't never been disloyal
If you ever cross me boy I'll put your body in the soil
I'm about respect and loyalty that's all I want in my family
I put you on, we smoking strong
This weed’s so good it’s got me gone
I love to get high, I love to stay fly
I'm gon' be rich 'til I die
Pourin' lean in a styrofoam, drivin' in a 'rarri
I just bought my main bitch a Maserati
My side bitch I bought that bitch a Corvette
She fucked me but I found out she's an informant
It's a dirty game a dirty world
No loyalty up in this world
Please tell me who I can trust
Everybody fake as fuck
