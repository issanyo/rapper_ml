[Hook]
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
I got my bricks from Julio
I got my bricks from Julio
I'm drinkin' on Don Julio
A hundred bricks from Julio, Julio

[Verse 1]
When I met Julio, I swear to God, my life changed
He done put me in that serious cocaine game
He told me what I had to do to get away with crime
And now I'm always loaded up with money all the time
He got locked up and man, I had to post his bail for him
He was a real nigga with me, I kept it real with him
You wanna tell on your plug, well, you's a pussy nigga
If they snatch me up, I don't know who the fuck is that nigga
I say, "Fuck you, and your feelings"
In the drug game I done made a killin'
Niggas want a problem, I'm ready for war
If you want problems, nigga, we come to your door
If you got a problem, nigga, I'll put you on the floor
And I put a gun right down in your throat
Shoot you in your body and your intestine
Don't ask me no fuckin' questions
When they put me in that room I don't ever fold
When they put me in that room I don't ever fold
Fuck you pussy pig
I need my lawyer, I ain't sayin' shit

[Hook]
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
I got my bricks from Julio
I got my bricks from Julio
I'm drinkin' on Don Julio
A hundred bricks from Julio, Julio

[Verse 2]
I started out in the streets with the eight ball
And went up to a Oz then half a ki
Now I got a whole ki and police know me
But fuck the police cause they can never stop me
I'm always gon' sell cocaine cause man, I swear I love it
Fuck this fame and fuck this music shit, I love that coco
They say that I'm loco and I done just went global
They always doubtin' Stitches but now I'm on the top, ho
And I'm from MIA, yo, I don't use a scale
I ball that work, bitch, and I don't ever fail
I'm always on point, ho, especially with my kilos
And bricks come throught the mail and they don't ever smell
Wrapped up in saran wrap and a lil foil
And a vaccum seal, you know the drill, ho
Drug dealer 'til the day I die, all the drugs that I supply
Cocaine is the first one that I always wanna supply

[Hook]
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
I got my bricks from Julio
I got my bricks from Julio
I'm drinkin' on Don Julio
A hundred bricks from Julio, Julio
