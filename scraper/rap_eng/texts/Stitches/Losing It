[Chorus]
Here I come
Here I go
Out of control
I'm losing it
And I don't know, where I'mma go
I'm running out of time, searching for my soul
(x2)

[Verse 1]
All of this fame
All it did was bring me all of this pain
They saying ''I changed''
I ain't changed with the fame
The money just came and they changed
You actin' like if you're entitled
I'm turning my idols to rivals
I'm pulling up in the Rolls Royce
Deep inside I know you don't like it
No matter how much you deny it
All my haters multiplyin'
They sayin' they gon' kill me
But I ain't scared of dying

I'm reading the Bible, I think that I'm psycho
I'm losing my mind and I don't know where I'mma go
I'm livin' too fast, I'm spending this cash, my momma tellin' me ''just take it slow''
I don't wanna sell drugs no more, I don't want the cops at my door
I'm lost in this cold world and I'm still searchin' for my soul

[Chorus]
Here I come
Here I go
Out of control
I'm losing it

And I don't know, where I'mma go
I'm running out of time, searching for my soul
(x2)

[Verse 2]
I feel like I'm running out of time
I got some problems on my mind
24/7 I'm hustlin'
Up on the streets I be on my grind
Reminiscing 'bout my past
Thinkin' how long I'mma last
And who's gonna be the hater to pull up on me
And pull out the gun and just blast
I just wanna live my life, no worries
I'm drinkin' on liquor, my vision is blurry
I just moved inside of a new house, my neighbours is telling me I'm a disturbance
And I just bought a new chain, remember the days that I was riding on the train
Couldn't even pay my bills, I couldn't even buy my wife a new wedding ring

I lost my soul, I lost my mind
I'm still searchin', but I'm running out of time

[Chorus]
Here I come
Here I go
Out of control
I'm losing it

And I don't know, where I'mma go
I'm running out of time, searching for my soul
(x2)

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be normal again
This industry made me lose all my friends
I feel like I sold my soul
Now I'm tryna take back control

[Chorus]
Here I come
Here I go
Out of control
I'm losing it

And I don't know, where I'mma go
I'm running out of time, searching for my soul
(x2)
