[Hook]
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
And I'm running with my Glock, this pussy cracker might get shot
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
And I'm running with my Glock, this pussy cracker might get shot

[Verse 1]
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
And I'm running with my Glock, this pussy cracker might get shot
Everybody say, they got your back but they snitching when you get break
I know the truth about your fuck nigga you riding down they mist
Cut his throat with a machete, cut his throat like I was edge
Talking 'bout my boy from Mexico, we will meet at the Texaco
He was my plug, he gave me them keys
You say you's a drug lord, nigga stop talking please
You fuck the police 'cause these niggas is pussy crackers
Hating on that boy Stitches 'cause this paper I'm stacking
I'm driving foreigns in every city I met
And every city I met, I got a strap

[Hook]
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
And I'm running with my Glock, this pussy cracker might get shot
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
And I'm running with my Glock, this pussy cracker might get shot

[Verse 2]
I'm a dope [?] nigga you ain't [?] no dope in yo' life
I'm that nigga that could change or run your whole fuckin' life
Just give me [?] I could send them keys right through the mail
And if the feds catch me slipping I know I won't get no bell
That's why I got them [?] working for me
They ain't no catching me slipping, can't catch no felonies
I got three kids my nigga, [?] they free
And I don't trust no nigga, I'm a OG
Fuck the police, they put my brothers in a penitentiary
And first the judge was tryna give them boys a sanctuary
I know them snitch niggas still while on the street
And they gon' die slow, my nigga like it's HIV

[Hook]
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
And I'm running with my Glock, this pussy cracker might get shot
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
I got dope up in my socks and I'm running from the cops
And I'm running with my Glock, this pussy cracker might get shot
