I’ve won a lot
I’ve lost a lot
I’ve made bad decisions
But, sometimes bad decisions turned into good outcomes
And I just wanna show y’all
Who the fuck I am
Stitches
Bitch

Most of the time I’m thinking about suicide
Emotions run in my body, something I can not hide
I need some pills doctor, Don’t talk, just prescribe
I never wanna be sober, I want to stay high

Don’t come around me, it’s dangerous
I don’t want yo love, I don’t want yo kids
Lately, I’m felling like I’m possesed
Got the devil next to me, but she wearing a dress
This shit right here, not making sense
This bitch is always on my conscience
And the only way to get this bitch off my mind
Is to get my gun and shoot my head one fucking time

If I give you a chance
Are you gon do me right
Would you walk through the fire
Just, so we could see light
Girl, tell me what is love?
If there’s no sacrifice
Just hold my hand
And I promise we’ll make through the night

They consider me a criminal
But, I got a heart
And it’s made of gold
Will I break your heart
Baby I don’t know
Will I fuck a groupie
While I’m on the road?
She told me:
Stitches I don’t really care
Tell you the truth
I don’t think that’s fair
If i break your heart
You gotta break mine
I apologize if i get out of line

Girl don’t do me wrong
Cuz i might lose my mind
She says that i’m bipolar
I always change my mind

One day I say I love her
One day I say I hate her
I still haven’t found a way to appreciate her !

[hook x2]
If I give you a chance
Are you gon do me right
Would you walk through the fire
Just, so we could see light
Girl, tell me what is love?
If there’s no sacrifice
Just hold my hand
And I'll promise we'll make it through the night
