[Intro: Stitches]
I'm saucy, I'm saucy, I'm saucy
I'm saucy, I'm saucy, I'm saucy

[Hook: Stitches]
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss

[Verse 1: Stitches]
I got lost in the sauce, I got lost up in that pussy
I got lost up in that booty, I got lost up in them titties
Bitch, I'm a boss, come fuck with a real nigga
I'm a real coke dealer, bitch, I am that nigga
Bitch, I don't need a scale, I ball that work
I'm a professional coke dealer, I got that work
Make a phone call and have my driver take it to you
If you try to send them off, I send them goons right after you
What is your address? I'm 'bout to find out right now
When they come to yo house, there ain't no knockin' in there
They kickin' yo door down right there, they 'bout to tie you right there
And we ain't playin' around, where is them bricks? Tell me now

[Hook: Stitches]
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss

[Verse 2: Str8 Kash]
Hey, lost in the sauce just because I am a boss
I'm sippin' on purple, your girl is my stripper
She lost in this dick and I'm lost in this money
I got all this paper, you can't take it from me
Kash be a [?]
And all these hoes, they get up on they knees
[?]
I'm a psycho in reality, got eighteen karat cavaties
Got million dollar plans, my plug, he say I'm crazy
Imma keep on stuntin', these niggas keep on hatin'
While I'm drivin' this Mercedes, that white girl be my lady
I know a couple souls that get you lost up in Little Haiti
They throw you off their boat, have you sleepin' with the fishes
Yayo to my knees, bitch, I'm lost in the kitchen

[Hook: Stitches]
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss
I got lost in the sauce, nigga, I'm a boss
