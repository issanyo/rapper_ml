Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me
Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me

[Verse 1]
Your boyfriend's a joke, your boyfriend is broke
Come fuck with Stitches, I got kilos on my boat
She sayin', "Stitches, I love you"
I think my diamonds make her crazy
First day she met me, say she wanna have my baby
I'm smokin' weed, I'm sippin' lean
Pull up in a Maserati up to the scene
TMZ takin' pictures, while I'm rollin' these swishers
Gettin' head while I'm drivin', and best belive I still kiss her
She say, "Stiches you too freaky for me"
To tell you the truth, I'm startin' to think that bitch is an informant
She's askin' way too many questions
Imma Chris Brown that ho, teach her a lesson
Slap that bitch two times and tell that bitch to get to steppin'
Imma always be rich, they call me, "Mister Steal Yo Bitch"
Now that boy say he got a problem
I got a AK-47, Imma solve it

[Hook]
Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me
Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me

[Verse 2]
I can teach ya how to sell them drugs
I can teach ya how to be a thug
Nigga, I done been through the struggle
Bitch I [?] but this no [?]
I swear to God, I'm tired of these fake rappers
These niggas say they real but they all actors
Nigga, I can teach ya how to really cook it
It ain't my fault your girl said I was good lookin'
I can't wait for the day my brothers step outta prison
Just so they could ride in foreigns with me, see how I'm livin'
I'm puttin' stacks up in they commissary
Cause if we got the same blood it's necessary
I hate to see them tears go down my mama's face
That's my queen and that's forever no one take her place
When I was on the run she kept my kilos at her place
And every court that I had she always showed her face
I love her

[Hook]
Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me
Bitch, you know I'm cookin'
Bitch, you know I'm whippin'
I'm whippin', whippin', whippin'
Got bricks up in my kitchen
They say my wrist game crazy
Front the nigga, twenty bricks, he better pay me
