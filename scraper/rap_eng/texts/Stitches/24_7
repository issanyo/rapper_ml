Twenty-four-seven
I be in the kitchen
I be in the kitchen
I be in the kitchen
Twenty-four-seven
I be in the kitchen
I be in the kitchen
I be in the kitchen
I can turn ten into twenty chickens
I can turn ten into twenty chickens
I can turn ten into twenty chickens
I ain't no cookboy, but I be in the kitchen

[Verse 1: Stitches]
Aye, I can turn cocaine into crack (Straight up!)
The work you workin' with, I know that shit is wack (Fool!)
I got a better price than your main connect (I do!)
But I don't talk up on the phone so how we gon' connect?
I cannot trust these boys, they all work with the feds
They get caught for a half a brick and then write a statement
(Snitch!)
But for the right price I can teach you how to whip it
I'm a kingpin when it comes to a kitchen (You know it!)
I can upgrade yo life, put chickens in yo life
Cocaine is my wife, I been about this life
You's a fairy tale, you fake as fuck
You broke as fuck, that's why I had to front you, bruh!

[Verse 2: Vice]
Cookin' in the kitchen, but I ain’t a chef
All these fumes up in the kitchen make you lose your breath
Whip game right, then I hit up my connect
And get my wrist game right, keep my pimp game tight
Fuck your mamma and your girl, on the same night
Leanin' in my whip from that lean in that sprite
Lookin' clean in that white, I’m Mr. Clean with that white
Activated from the activist, I'mma cocaine activist
Don’t play with my money, I blast a bitch
If you missed yo shot, just pass the brick
You ain’t gotta lie, just keep real
All these boys fake when shit gets real
Foldin' under pressure, playin' in the field
I’m a savage in this game, I was built to kill
24/7 I be whippin' just to pay the bills
