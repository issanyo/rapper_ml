[Intro]
HAHAHAHA!
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Hook]
Let a young hitta get paid
Let a young hitta get paid
Let a young hitta get paid
Play with my money and you gettin' sprayed
I bet you can't dodge my bullets
I bet you can't dodge my bullets
You can throw dirt on my name
But Imma put more dirt on your grave

[Verse 1]
I heard that boy talkin' negative about me
Wait 'til I see that fuck boy in the county
I'm a type of goon to put a bounty on ya
I'll have you dead in ten minutes if I really want ya
TMI Gang, It's my fuckin' squad
I'm sellin' kilos but I can never get a job
No sir, that was never me
But I can be your boss and I can front you a ki
You better pay me back on time, boy
Before my gun get's up on the line, boy
You know that I stay with them extendo's
I'll shoot a rapper quick at his own show
From a microphone, to a funeral
Hatin' ass fool, man, you gotta go
I'm a menace to society
I'm a drug dealer with variety

[Hook]
Let a young hitta get paid
Let a young hitta get paid
Let a young hitta get paid
Play with my money and you gettin' sprayed
I bet you can't dodge my bullets
I bet you can't dodge my bullets
You can throw dirt on my name
But Imma put more dirt on your grave

[Verse 2]
I can see your heart beat through your white tee
I'm the wrong person to make your enemy
Don't do it, I'm tellin' you
It's a good night, I ain't tryna be shootin' you
You don't want problems
I'm the definition of a problem
Twenty-five murders and they still can't solve 'em
Fuck first forty-eight
If I killed somebody, I don't leave a clue
I killed your homeboy, what you gonna do?
Nothin', stop, stop frontin'
You can have a strap but you still shootin' nothin'
Shut your motherfucking mouth, you ain't never been a G
When they talkin' about greatness, they talkin' about me
Bury me in a gold casket
Even dead, I'm still real flashin'

[Hook]
Let a young hitta get paid
Let a young hitta get paid
Let a young hitta get paid
Play with my money and you gettin' sprayed
I bet you can't dodge my bullets
I bet you can't dodge my bullets
You can throw dirt on my name
But Imma put more dirt on your grave
Let a young hitta get paid
Let a young hitta get paid
Let a young hitta get paid
Play with my money and you gettin' sprayed
I bet you can't dodge my bullets
I bet you can't dodge my bullets
You can throw dirt on my name
But Imma put more dirt on your grave
