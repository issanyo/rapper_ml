[Hook]
Girl I know he ain't treating you right
Baby girl I'm here to save you tonight
Let's drink let's smoke let's all get faded
Every night a celebration
Girl I know you've been through pain
Don't worry I've been through the same

[Verse 1]
Girl I know, I know, I know
You've been through pain that's for sure
I got the cure baby I can save you
They probably told you I was a player
But I'm not, no I'm not
I'm trying to take you with me to the top
I can see it in your eyes you've been through a lot
But it's gon' be alright

[Bridge]
Girl I know (girl I know, I know, I know)
Girl I know (girl I know, I know, I know)
Girl I know (girl I know, I know, I know)
Girl I know (girl I know, I know, I know)

[Hook]
Girl I know he ain't treating you right
Baby girl I'm here to save you tonight
Let's drink let's smoke let's all get faded
Every night a celebration
Girl I know you've been through pain
Don't worry I've been through the same

[Verse 2]
They underestimated me they said I wasn't shit
But every song that I jump on I promise you that I'mma rip
Driving foreigns, foreigns, back then they was stolen
Only twenty years old but your boy high rolling
See I knew this fame was coming but it took faith and patience
My momma always told me I was real impatient
So if you talking about pain girl I've been through it
Listen to me when I talk to you through my music

[Bridge]
Girl I know (girl I know, I know, I know)
Girl I know (girl I know, I know, I know)
Girl I know (girl I know, I know, I know)
Girl I know (girl I know, I know, I know)

[Hook]
Girl I know he ain't treating you right
Baby girl I'm here to save you tonight
Let's drink let's smoke let's all get faded
Every night a celebration
Girl I know you've been through pain
Don't worry I've been through the same
