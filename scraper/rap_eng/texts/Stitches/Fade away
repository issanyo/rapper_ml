[Intro]
Uh huh yeah
And that's just how I feel (Hahah)
They say I'm a drug addict (Haha ok)
But maybe I got too many fucking problems

[Hook]
I Sip Lean I Pop Percs
To take the pain away
Don't let this high fade away   /x2

[Verse 1: Stitches]
I Sip Lean and Pop Percs
And I fuck bitches all night
So many problems on my damn mind
But this shit make me feel right
I'm on tour, I'm making money
My old friends, they hatin on me
Got old money, still waiting on me
Got brick money, still waiting on me
You a fuck boy, Imma D-Boy
On the microphone, boy I destroy
That fame shit, ain't change me boy
I'll still snatch the chains off you boy
TMI Gang, that's what I'm reppin
Selling that dope and you know I ain't steppin
Selling that dope, that's my profession
Shut the fuck up, don't ask me questions

[Hook]
I Sip Lean I Pop Percs
To take the pain away
Don't let this high fade away   x4

[Verse 2: Stitches]

I just wanna Sip Lean all night
I just wanna Pop Percs all night
My brother call me frome the prison
He said boy you trippin
I told him don't worry about me homie I'm just livin'
I'm cashin out, I'm cashin out
But the drugs that I'm takin got me spazzin out
I'm pouring lean, I'm smoking weed
I'm a fucking feind when it comes to codeine
I'm trippin, trippin, trippin
Cuz I'm sipin, sipin, sipin
Never slippin, chain on my neck
I dare somebody to try come and grip it
Before I sold them drugs, I used to rob everybody I knew
If I can't trust myself how the fuck can I trust you
Let me take you back to that old school
When i was riding round my old school
I used to sell drugs at my old school
And your new bitch is my old news

[Hook]
I Sip Lean I Pop Percs
To take the pain away
Don't let this high fade away   x4
