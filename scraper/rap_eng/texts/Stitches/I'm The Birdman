[Hook]
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman
I'm like Pablo Escobar for real, man

[Verse 1]
A hundred birds, I'll dunk 'em on you like I'm Birdman
No scale, I ball to work cause I'm the Birdman
I got too much ink, I'm feelin' like I'm Birdman
Yeah, my name is Stitches, but you can call me Birdman
Twenty kilos in the mail (I'll send it!)
Twenty kilos in my trunk, ride with a pump
I'll shoot a pig quick, I don't give a fuck
I'm still gon' do life if they catch me with these drugs

[Hook]
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman
I'm like Pablo Escobar for real, man

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know Imma die at an young age
That's why I'm throwin' straight birds off the damn stage
You ain't no drug dealer, fool
Lyin' to hoes, man, you thinkin' that shit cool
I use a kilo as my pillow, boy
I used to front cocaine to you, oh boy
So I guess I'm your daddy's daddy
I made a million off that arm and hammer
I'm with the he cause I'm the Birdman

[Hook]
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman
I'm like Pablo Escobar for real, man
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman, Birdman, Birdman
I'm the Birdman
I'm like Pablo Escobar for real, man
