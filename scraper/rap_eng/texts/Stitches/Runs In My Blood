[Intro]
Cuz it runs in my blood, fool
Cuz it runs in my blood, fool
Runs in my blood, fool
Cuz it runs in my blood, fool
Cuz it runs in my blood, fool

[Verse 1]
Who the releast in the room? Baby, you look at him (Stitches!)
20 chains on my neck, I know you lookin' at 'em (Them jewels!)
I ain't have help from my mom and dad (Never!)
I'm a chemistry in the kitchen, no Breaking Bad (You know it!)
I took yo clientele, now you lookin' sad
I took yo main bitch too, now you wanna shoot my ass
Well, guess what? I stay strapped up
In the two seated foreign, two bitches lapped up
I came up, I ain't going back down (Never!)
It's my time to shine (You know it!), I'mma take over now (Stitches!)
I'm Stitches, bitch! That's my fuckin' name
No snitch, bitch, this [??] behind my name
I never feel no shame
Prolly cause I been thorugh so much pain
Do not compare cuz we ain't the same
I pull one in your brain
Hey, no residue is left of you
Donâ€™t matter cuz nobody even knew of you

[Hook]
I won't stop being a thug cuz it runs in my blood
Cuz it runs in my blood, fool
Cuz it runs in my blood, fool [2x]

[Verse 2]
I'm thuggin' every morning, thuggin' every night
Rollie on my wrist, this thing is filled with ice (Brr!)
I ain't never had a problem rockin' jewels
To think that you could rob me, you must be a fool (You crazy!)
Ink up in my face, bruh, I don't need a job
I can't be friendly with these boys, cuz I'm runnin' a mob
I'm a mobster, these bullets will drop ya
Have you screamin' for yo mommy or yo pappa. Haha!

[Hook]
