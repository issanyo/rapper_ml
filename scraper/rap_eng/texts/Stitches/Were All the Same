[Chorus]
What if everything that we know wasn’t real?
All these guns were made just to kill
An’ why do we love popping all these pills?
We’re all the same
We’re all the same
We’re all the same
We all go through pain
We’re all the same
We’re all the same
We all go through pain
We’re all the same

[Verse 1]
When I look in the mirror
Don’t even know who I am
So many problems in my head you just won’t understand
I’m popping pills just to take away all of the pain
I’m trapped up with the fame I guess it’s just part of the game
I need help
I’ve been talking to myself for two weeks, I even played a game of hide and seek
When I look in the mirror I see a monster when I look in the mirror I see my father
Suicide I’ve been think bout it lately, Rex I love you but this world got me crazy
I’m bout to put the gun in my head and pull the trigger and up until December happens all of you remember
Me as your dad and not a criminal
One day you come and one day you go just make me a promise that you never follow my footstep
Or my dead body is gonna show up onto your doorstep

[Chorus]
What if everything that we know wasn’t real?
All these guns were made just to kill
An’ why do we love popping all these pills?
We’re all the same
We’re all the same
We’re all the same
We all go through pain
We’re all the same
We’re all the same
We all go through pain
We’re all the same

[Verse 2]
He’s gay, he’s black, she’s hooked on crack, don’t judge nobody cause we’re all the same. Flesh and bone, live and die no matter what skin colour we multiply
(Fo'real)
Have you felt like the world was on your back
Tryna be a better person but it’s hard to do that
Do you feel like something or someone is holding you back from becoming the one
You’ve been living in the shade tryna get a glimpse of the sun Have you been reminiscing about everything you’ve done
I have, I’ve been there before thinking bout giving up, I’ve been there before
Hundred Xanax in my hand I’m about to pop em all only question that I got when I die where will I go

[Chorus]
What if everything that we know wasn’t real?
All these guns were made just to kill
An’ why do we love popping all these pills?
We’re all the same
We’re all the same
We’re all the same
We all go through pain
We’re all the same
We’re all the same
We all go through pain
We’re all the same

WE’RE ALL THE SAME

WE’RE ALL THE SAME
