[Chorus]
When I die would you remember me?
I'm alive right now so come close to me
When you get that phone call it’ll be a tragedy
My best friend turned into my enemy
And they always wanna know why I ride with my rifle
The streets so cold and they turned me into a psycho
And they always wanna know why I ride with my rifle
The streets so cold and they turned me into a psycho

[Verse 1]
I got no love left (no love)
I'm heartless (I'm heartless)
They say they go hard
I go the hardest (fool!)
They wanna see me fall (fall)
They praying every day for it
They don’t wanna see me pull up in a brand new foreign (skrrt)
See my mind fucked up (Grr)
I got no friends
And everybody waiting for that day my life end
Well thats a crazy story
I got here by myself
And everybody hating how I'm increasing my wealth
See my family is all I'm worried about
Thank god thank god they let my homeboy Leo out
They was try him with the murder Rico conspiracy
Tryna lock him in the call and throw away the key
The streets so cold (the streets so cold)
I don't know where imma go (I don't know where imma go)
They tryna give me bullet holes
Imma ganger with a heart full of gold (I love everybody)

[Chorus]
When I die would you remember me?
I'm alive right now so come close to me
When you get that phone call it'll be a tragedy
My best friend turned into my enemy
And they always wanna know why I ride with my rifle
The streets so cold and they turned me into a psycho
And they always wanna know why I ride with my rifle
The streets so cold and they turned me into a psycho

[Verse 2]
Riding with the bricks
Riding with a stick
Just incase if they tryna hit a lick
Imma rip this shit
Shoot em up
Semi automatic
Make this shit get dramatic
I don't wanna pull the trigger
Make it become a habit
All of the pain and all of the struggle
It just made me get up and go out and hustle
The one that done turn they back on you is the one that tell you they love you
You don’t love me homeboy you don’t even love yourself
You don't got loyalty in ya
I think you need some help

[Chorus]
When I die would you remember me?
I’m alive right now so come close to me
When you get that phone call it'll be a tragedy
My best friend turned into my enemy
And they always wanna know why I ride with my rifle
The streets so cold and they turned me into a psycho
And they always wanna know why I ride with my rifle
The streets so cold and they turned me into a psycho
