[Hook]
Time after time, I sit and I cry
Thinking about, what's going on in my life
If you can relate, put your hands in the air
If you're going through pain, put your hands in the air
Don't let your pride hide the fact that inside you're scared
If you're living that life, just make sure that you're prepared
If you're listening to this song, then that means that you're blessed
You woke up today with the heart beating in your chest
Problem after problem, how do we solve 'em
Suicidal thoughts we're talking to our resolvers

[Verse 1]
What am I worth? Why does it hurt?
Can't even get out of my bed, thank god I don't work
I'm focused, also distracted
Paranoid that the cops gon' come inside of my house and find what's inside of my mattress
I'm like damn
I feel like the man, but really I don't, don't know who I am, who am I, and why do I cry
Why do I act so brave, when I know I'm dying inside
I wanna make my momma proud
I wanna make my brothers smile
I wanna make my kids remember me, every moment I'm not around
Don't lose it, Stitches, hold your composure
I know it feels like the end, but it's not done till it's over
As I get older, I get wiser, I find it easier to spot a liar
They selling dreams like a dealer selling to a friends
I got issues, you got issues, let's cry together
Matter fact, here's a tissue

[Hook]
Time after time, I sit and I cry
Thinking about, what's going on in my life
If you can relate, put your hands in the air
If you're going through pain, put your hands in the air
Don't let your pride hide the fact that inside you're scared
If you're living that life, just make sure that you're prepared
If you're listening to this song, then that means that you're blessed
You want love today with the heart beating in your chest
Problem after problem, how do we solve 'em
Suicidal thoughts we're talking to our resolvers

[Verse 2]
I know it hurts, when you can't even pay your bills
Your kids are hungry, and you can't even provide a meal
Shoutout to every artist out there waiting on a deal, I hope you get it
I wanna turn my TV on and see you win
And too much jealousy inside in the air
To come across a genuine friend these days, it is rare
And everything that I take, every breath I inhale
I'm repaint for my sins
Right now I feel like it's hell
That I'm living inside
I look up the sky
I face reality today could be the day that
I die, and on the real
I love all of my people
It's time to stop this racist shit
And see each as equals

[Hook]
Time after time, I sit and I cry
Thinking about, what's going on in my life
If you can relate, put your hands in the air
If you're going through pain, put your hands in the air
Don't let your pride hide the fact that inside you're scared
If you're living that life, just make sure that you're prepared
If you're listening to this song, then that means that you're blessed
You want love today with the heart beating in your chest
Problem after problem, how do we solve 'em
Suicidal thoughts we're talking to our resolvers
