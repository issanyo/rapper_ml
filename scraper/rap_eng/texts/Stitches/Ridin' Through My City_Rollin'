[Part 1: Ridin' Through My City]

[Hook]
Ridin' through my city, everybody know my name
Niggas gettin' jealous cause their girl screamin' my name
I got money up in the air, I got money up on the floor
Niggas talkin' all of that shit cause they know Lil Phill gon' blow
I be ridin' through my city, everybody know my name
Niggas gettin' jealous cause their girl screamin' my name
I got money up in the air, I got money up on the floor
Niggas talkin' all of that shit cause they know Lil Phill gon' blow

[Verse 1]
"Lil Phill", that be my name, in the club, I make it rain
All these girls, they go insane, I'm sippin' on that champagne
I don't need nobody else, I do this shit all on my own
I got your girl, I took her home, she goin' down, she give me dome
I switch it up, she ridin' me, I bet her boyfriend mad at me
You ain't gotta trip, baby, cause I know that you glad to be
Chillin' here with Lil Phill, I hype you up like you on the pill
And baby girl, this shit for real, and baby girl, you know the drill
I take you out, we go to the mall, show these niggas how we gon' ball
Everyday I say, "Fuck the law", I rape the beat like Bill [?]
I suck a pussy without a straw, got confidence that I'm [?] tall
These hatin' niggas, they 'bout to fall, these hatin' niggas, they 'bout to fall

[Hook]
Ridin' through my city, everybody know my name
Niggas gettin' jealous cause their girl screamin' my name
I got money up in the air, I got money up on the floor
Niggas talkin' all of that shit cause they know Lil Phill gon' blow
I be ridin' through my city, everybody know my name
Niggas gettin' jealous cause their girl screamin' my name
I got money up in the air, I got money up on the floor
Niggas talkin' all of that shit cause they know Lil Phill gon' blow

[Verse 2]
Everyday I'm hustlin', I gotta stay up on my grind
These hatin' niggas can wait in line cause it is my time to shine
Makin' money everyday, it will blow your mind away
I got my gun, I got my bullets, so you know how [?] away
Put a nigga down on the ground, pitchin' bullets all on the mouth
He thinkin' that you run the streets and you gon' be under the ground
That means that you gonna die, say your prayers then say, "Bye-bye"
Say your prayers then say, "Bye-bye", Lil Phill, that nigga fly

[Hook]
Ridin' through my city, everybody know my name
Niggas gettin' jealous cause their girl screamin' my name

Niggas talkin' all of that shit cause they know Lil Phill gon' blow
I be ridin' through my city, everybody know my name
Niggas gettin' jealous cause their girl screamin' my name
I got money up in the air, I got money up on the floor

[Part 2: Rollin']

[Intro]
Ha, and I go by the name Lil Phill...
Ha, and I go by the name Lil Phill, nigga
Ha, and I go by the name Lil Phill, nigga
Real boy, nigga, shout-out to my nigga M. Deniro, nigga
We out here makin' money, nigga, stacks on stacks, nigga
Yeah

[Verse]
Yo, I-I win the game like a nigga playin' poker
If she on Facebook, nigga, I poke her
Heard you talkin' shit but to me you was a doker
Heard you rent the pussy cause Lil Phill be the owner
Money on my mind, I can take it all
Your girl on me, now them clothes comin' off
Met her in the day, fucked her in the night
I left up in the mornin' and I told her, "Keep it tight"
Real-real boy, baby, never tell a lie
Tatts on me, so the girls think I'm fly
Rollin' to the club in the G35
And these niggas gettin' mad cause their bitches wavin' high
Real ass nigga, it's never gon' change
You claim to have the money but you be throwin' the change
Walk up in the club, you know I make it rain
These niggas say I'm crazy, man, they see I'm insane
Bottle after bottle, probably fuck a model
Spendin' all this money, lookin' like I won the lotto
A lot of people hate me, they will never face me
This shit you talk on YouTube will never [?]
Got the game on lock, you might need a locksmith
Knock a nigga down but I ain't talkin' boxin'
Can't be in jail cause I hate to be boxed in
I gotta make it to the top, the clock keep tickin'
I cut a nigga up, I ain't talkin' razor
Put me on the mic and I add a little flavor
Niggas wanna sign me, put me on the label
The doctor said I'm crazy and my brain is not stable
[?], niggas see me on the cable
Your girl the pancake, I can be the maple
Put her on the bed, she call me, "Papi chulo"
Hit it in the ass, I been talkin' 'bout the culo, nigga

[Outro]
Ha, so fuck y'all niggas, man
Heh, Lil Phill, nigga
M. Deniro my nigga, man
We makin' this shit out here, nigga
Yeah, y'all niggas can hate as much you want, nigga
But I'm still gon' make it, boy
Fuck you!
