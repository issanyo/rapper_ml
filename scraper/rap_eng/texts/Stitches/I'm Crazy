Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

[Verse 1]
Pull up to yo' mama house
Shhh, be quiet (brrr)
There's going to be some violence
All I wanna hear is silence (shut up!)
Suppressor on my gun (fring!)
Kill yo' mama for fun (haha!)
Oh no, oh no, oh no (oh no)
Look what I dun done (what happened?)
If the police pull up, fuck it
Nigga I'mma have to just run (run)
Laugh about it when I get to the crib (why?)
Because I just got away with murder (haha!)
No fingerprints, no evidence
When I ran up in that residence
She was let up on the couch with my dick up in her mouth
Hahaha, as I took a bitch out
She was let up on the couch with my dick up in her mouth
Hahaha, as I took a bitch out

[Verse 2]
I'm talking to myself (grrr)
I'm losing my mind (my mind)
I'm thinking 'bout killing (who?)
An old friend of mine (let's get it)
You turned your back on me (pussy!)
You should have never ever did that! (grrr)
I'mma pull out the chopper I'mma rip that (brrr)
Snap a nigga neck like a kit kat (ting!)
You should have never ever did that (never!)
Now I'm gonna pull a pussy nigga way back (brrr)
