It ain't me
There's gotta be more to chose from
This place that charges 10 dollar admission
This is where you wanna go
Cuz there's nothing left to do
This is where you wanna go
But I don't think so
This is where you wanted to go
This is where you wanted to be
Your daddy's car's got four doors to chose from
Your daddy's car's got automatic transmission
This is where you wanted to go
Cuz there's nothing left to do

This is where you wanted to go
But I don't think so
This is where you wanted to go
This is where you wanted to be
But nothing here's for free i don't think so
This is right now right here
This is nowhere
This is where you wanted to go
This is nowhere
This is where you wanted to go
Cuz there's nothing left to do
This is where you wanted to go
But I don't think so
This is where you wanted to go
This is where you wanted to be
This is what you wanted to do
But there's nothing here for me
This is where you wanted to be
But nothing here's for free
I don't think so
This is nowhere
