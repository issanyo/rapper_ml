Girl you've been through pain
I been through the same
I'mma 'bout to show you that your life can really change
Fuck with me girl and I'll show you what it could be
Fuck with me girl and I'll show you what it could be
40 million dollars we gon' spend the shit together
Ball-out in every city, we gon' be rich forever
He gave you a taste, I rather give you it all
He gave you a taste, I rather give you it all

[Verse 1]
All the darkness around me
It's probably why I shine so much
I know what it feels like to starve, that's probably why I grind so much
I've been broke, but now I'm rich
I'm been real I never been a bitch
You just talk, you just rappin', I'm in the streets, I'm really trappin
First class flights, if not I'm on a private jet
Bitch told me "Go get a life", I told that bitch I'm livin' it
[?]
Make her sweat like the sauna is on
Girl you know I rock Louis Vuitton
And I smoke weed til' my problems are gone
Im addicted to codeine, I don't ever wanna stop
If I see them red and blue lights I'm runnin from the cops
I'mma criminal I will never change, I remain the same
And if you'll be my rider girl, I'll put you on to this game

[Verse 2]
I don't gotta lie girl you know that my life is the truth
I'm a real G if I'm In or I'm out of the booth
What you spend on your coupe, I just spend on my shoes
Codeine make numb and I just popped the blue
Don't got love for my father, cause he never cared
Don't got love for my father cuz he wasn't there
He used to beat up my mamma ,a whole lot of drama
And it fucked me up in my head and it left me with the trauma Fall in love with a girl, I didn't did it before
But love can get really complicated especially when I'm on tour
So tell me, Where do we stand? Is this sex or am I your man? Up in public holding ur hand, we both got haters, who gives a damn!
