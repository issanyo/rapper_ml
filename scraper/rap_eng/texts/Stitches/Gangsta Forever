[Verse 1]
I ain't got no friends no more
Feds trynna come knock down my door
All these motherfuckers be straight snitching
All these motherfuckers be straight Bitching
The last thing you should do is never mention
My name to a cop when they ask you a question
Percs and Xans always take the pain away
I'll shoot a pussy down with my throw away
Loyalty I demand it
I'm getting too much money they can't stand it
They wanna kill me
They better plan it good
Couse they ain't gone catch me slipping like Pac and Shug
