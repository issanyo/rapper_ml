[Hook]
On my way to heaven
And my murder was a mistery
If I'm being honest
You just took me out my misery
Hold on
Hold on, Imma see you again
Hold on
Hold on, Imma see you again

[Verse 1]
I wouldn't look back if I was you
I wouldn't trust a soul I see
Wait for it - it can happen anytime
I wouldn't trust nobody
It might have started off as a dream
But I'm gonna make sure it's a nightmare for you
That's not something you can escape
Revenge is not over till you're trough
Cause it's not too late
It's not too late I'm getting colder
End of the night your hands might fight
I got the devil on my shoulder

[Hook]
On my way to heaven
And my murder was a mistery
If I'm being honest
You just took me out my misery
Hold on
Hold on, Imma see you again
Hold on
Hold on, Imma see you again

[Verse 2]
No one's gonna save you when you're in too deep
There's not a fucking soul that can protect you
My kids got my legacy now
I'll die for them all over if I had to
Money, music, fame - but the streets got me
I put myself at rise for my family
I know that they'll forgive me when they're older
I told the whole world to make 'em happy
But it's not too late
It's not too late I'm walking over
End of the night your hands might fight
I got the devil on my shoulder


[Hook x2]
On my way to heaven
And my murder was a mistery
If I'm being honest
You just took me out my misery
Hold on
Hold on, Imma see you again
Hold on
Hold on, Imma see you again
