[Pre-Hook]
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
Pull, pull yo pussy card
I'll pull yo pussy card out
Pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer

[Hook]
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer

[Verse 1]
I'll pull yo pussy card out like a black jack dealer
At the Hard Rock Casino
Don't call me Stitches no more
I'm a boss like Gambino
AK with the extendo
Then I go, take yo ho
Touchdown in that pussy
Like I'm Tony Romo
I'm lovin' life, I'm lovin' life
Just killed that boy then fucked his wife
I know a lot of people wanna take my life
But I know they wished they had my life
Boy, you cannot have this life
Bitch, a gangsta's paradise
I'm always winning any turn
But boy, I'll let you roll your dice

[Hook]
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, it's a big relief
I just blew up, no more coke in my [?]
You callin' me in for a feature
You better have more than ten bands, bruh
I ain't with that bullshit
Imma shoot and I'll shoot you with my full clip
Popped a xanax, now I'm clear minded
I'm just a young nigga that's shining!
Jump to the cocaine real fast
Then I started making real cash
I'm about my respect and about my cash
So I dare you to run over my ass!

[Pre-Hook]
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
Pull, pull yo pussy card
I'll pull yo pussy card out
Pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer

[Hook]
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
I'll pull yo pussy card out like I'm a card dealer
