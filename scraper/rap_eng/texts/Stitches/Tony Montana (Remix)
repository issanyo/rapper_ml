[Hook: Str8 Kash]
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony Montana, I keep me the llama
Tony Montana, you don't want the drama
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony Montana, keep that arm and hammer
Tony Montana, you don't want the drama

[Verse 1: Str8 Kash]
Tony what they callin' me, 305, [?] shit, hey
Cocaine like the [?]
July look like December
I need a brand new brick of bad bitch and a Popeye
Ask around the way, Str8 Kash known for cookin', boy
Hey, diñero, diñero, dame más diñero
From Mexico it's yellow
Smokin' cigarello while I'm sippin' Amaretto
Dope boy DNA, to them niggas I'm a hero
Them boys kicked down your door and turn yo commas into zero
Watch them boys on your phone lyin' like a ringtone
Got my word and my balls, nigga, cause my mind's blown
So keep slippin' while I'm sippin' on this styrophone
Sosa on the line, I'll put a shotgun through my spine
Watch the ones you bang with cause I heard they droppin' dimes
Say they one-hundred but they all just tellin' lies
Stick to yourself, stack that paper to the sky, hey

[Hook: Str8 Kash]
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony Montana, I keep me the llama
Tony Montana, you don't want the drama
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony Montana, keep that arm and hammer
Tony Montana, you don't want the drama

[Verse 2: Stitches]
I go by the Brick Bible
Homie, you ain't got no Brick Bible
I stick to the code of this game
Ain't no snitchin', you gotta respect the game
These pussies throwin' dirt up on your name
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
I'm Tony Montana in his prime (Cocaina)
I'm gettin' money and that's all the time (Diñero)
I wipe my ass with a hundred dollar bill
And last week I rolled a blunt with a hundred dollar bill
I'm Tony Montana, I'm Tony Montana
I'm Tony Montana, I'm Tony Montana, motherfucker!
TMI Gang!

[Hook: Str8 Kash]
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony Montana, I keep me the llama
Tony Montana, you don't want the drama
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony Montana, keep that arm and hammer
Tony Montana, you don't want the drama

[Outro: Str8 Kash]
Tony, what they callin' me
Tony, what they callin' me
