Verse 1:
Drug dealer, drug lord
Bricks they come from mexico
One thing that you gotta know, stitches never been a hoe
Bitch you now i got it, got bricks like i'm drug addict
Talk shit you ain't nothing lil' homie i'm the life of the party
Everybody know that my coke be A1 since day one
Walk into the building your bitches telling me that i'm handsome
Yeah you know that i'm turnt up, i'm drinking own liquor
Play around with T.M.I. GANG and we shoot you down real quick bru
T.M.I. GANG is the click I claim
I'm screaming fuck the other side cuz them boys real lame
I'm in the club with fifty bottles all up on the table
You can't talk shit bout stitches if you can't pay your own cabel
You can't hate on me if you still live with mommy, I sell periko for a living motherfucker
