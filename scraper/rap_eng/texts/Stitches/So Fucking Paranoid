[Chorus]
I can't sleep at night
The streets got me paranoid
Police following me
They're the ones I try to avoid
I know they wanna see, me in the penitentiary
And I know when the judge sees me I'm gon' get a century
(x2)

[Verse 1]
Dreamin' of never scheming
What's the meaning of selling drugs if you can't even wake up
Without a guilty conscience
I got fifty kilos in my apartment
Fuck the police cause all they wanna do is fuck with me
I'm just tryna get this money always keep my children company
So why you tryna let me up (why)
Why you tryna hold me down (why)
The best advice, I could ever give a cop, is what comes around goes around (Grrrr)
Uh, This ain't no threat it's just the truth
Eventually i'll come and will get you
And this gonna hit you 10 times harder
You better hope the god blesses you

[Chorus]
I can't sleep at night
The streets got me paranoid
Police following me
They're the ones I try to avoid
I know they wanna see, me in the penitentiary
And I know when the judge sees me I'm gon' get a century

[Verse 2]
Looking at my rear view mirror
Just to make sure the coast is clear
If the cops tryna pull me over
I might have to pull and chased in here
If they chase me with this white (this white)
I'm losing my freedom tonight
I left my kids fatherless
That's selfish and that just isn't right
What do I tell 'em in visitations
If i was gon' be a ghost why did I create 'em
Family is everything
Fuck a watch and fuck a chain
Fuck a car and fuck a bitch
I really just spend time with my kids
But the only way i can pay my bills is to
Go out there and flip a brick

[Chorus]
I can't sleep at night
The streets got me paranoid
Police following me
They're the ones I try to avoid
I know they wanna see, me in the penitentiary
And I know when the judge sees me I'm gon' get a century
