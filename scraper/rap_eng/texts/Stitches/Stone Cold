[Part 1]
Ridin' through dade county in a donk, motherfucker
27-inch rims on this donk motherfucker
Lotsa niggas talkin' shit
When I talk you just see diamonds
And I know about your jewels
Boy you rockin' fake diamonds
I can teach you how to work a wrist up in the kitchen
I can teach you how to really  re-up on them chickens
Fuck the highschool diploma 'cause I ain't get one
Fuck the police my nigga, I don't respect 'em
They always fuckin' with a nigga until I check 'em
I'm a stone cold gorrila
It's time to learn your lesson
Who you think you playin' with, cracker? I'm a shock collar
Call 'em up real quick and get 'em shot
Aye, I'm a show caller

Street nigga since I came out of my mom
You ain't no killer, nigga
So you don't wanna start no drama
I'll kill your whole family
And I'm starting with your momma
I bet you wanna call police right now (but you can't)
This chopper got a silencer but it's not gon' be loud
No pussies up in my squad
'Cause that shit is not allowed
I get turnt up in my shows
And I throw coke in the crowd
Pull up in a Maserati and my bass is bassin' loud
I Got a bulletproof car 'cause I got a lotta haters
I'm takin' niggas out the game
One by one like Terminator
I'm 'bout my paper, I'm 'bout my money
And if I don't get my money, this chopper act funny
It's a, it's a homicide
