[Hook: Str8 Kash & Stitches]
Left my girl at home
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Got my Rolie on
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy

[Verse 1: Str8 Kash]
Lights, camera, action, need some sexual satisfaction
Pop that cork on that champagne, girl, while you dancin'
It take nothin' to me, baby girl, I do this often
Pop that ass up on me, pussy runnin' like a faucet
The Rémy, the Henny, the Twenty, the Rosé
I'm bradin', yo, I'm twisted
Niggas [?]
Versace up on me, [?]
You lost your girl and it looks like I won her
I be in front, [?]
I ain't a cop, I ain't gon' cuff her
[? (Spanish)]
I'm worldwide with this turn-up
Got hoes in Acapulco

[Hook: Str8 Kash & Stitches]
Left my girl at home
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Got my Rolie on
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy

[Verse 2: Stitches]
I been drinkin' wat too much lately, they callin' me alocholic
Everyday I'm in the club and you know Stitches be ballin'
It's TMI Gang, homie, your girl eat my pepperoni
She call me everytime she in the crib and she is lonely
Drinkin' CÎROC like P. Diddy, pourin' Belaire on her titties
I ain't gon' be your boyfriend, girl, cause I will never be committed
These hoes ain't loyal, these hoes ain't loyal
She ugly when she suck my dick like a gargoyle
That bitch my lawyer, that bitch my lawyer
I give her good dick so I got a free lawyer
My life is good, my life is gravy
My mama said, "God bless you", but he couldn't save me

[Hook: Str8 Kash & Stitches]
Left my girl at home
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Got my Rolie on
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bitch, I'm tryna turn up
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy
Bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles and pussy

[Outro: Str8 Kash]
Drinks in the sky, drinks in the sky
Drinks in the sky, drinks in the sky
Drinks in the sky, turn-up, turn-up, turn-up
