[Hook]
I put that brick in your face
(say what)
Now what you gon' do with it?

Better have my money when I come to collect

[Verse 1]
You better have my money when I come to collect
(Pay up)
I got a bullet in the chamber and it's ready to eject
(Pop, pop, pop, pop)
You ain't a man, you's a kid, call it child neglect, lil boy
If you wanna shoot a fade, I'll leave your face leakin'
You better not tell the police I did it
Out in Dade County, anything goes
Always at the scene with some blood on my clothes
Then I go sell coke to your ho
Sorry if you didn't know
That your girl love my blow
One hit, now the girl on the pole
I LOVE SELLIN' BLOW!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE SELLIN' BLOW!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE SELLIN' BLOW!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVE SELLIN' BLOW!!!!!!!!!!

[Verse 2]
You say you need a hundred bricks, well, I'm the connect
(I got it)
I make drug money, fool, I don't need a rap check
(Never)
If I front you the brick you better pay up
This my lifestyle, fool, this ain't no threat
And we can bet on that
I got an AK-47 on my face, ho
So you know I don't shoot no pistol
I dare you to come near my threshold
This gun will not reload
Cause bitch I got extendos
Bitch, I got extendos
Don't play with me boy, don't play with me boy
Go play your Nintendo

[Hook]

Better have my money when I come to collect
Better have my money when I come to collect
Pay up, pay up, pay up
I put that brick in your face

Now what you gon' do with it?
Better have my money when I come to collect
Better have my money when I come to collect
