[Verse 1]
Mmmmm, there's taste on my tongue
Makin' doo doo noise, damn it's funky
Stezo, i'm gettin' stupider than stupid
This is a dope beat, the way that I looped it
Yes, my name is Stezo-E, the only one
When i'm on the microphone, i'm nobody's son
MC's start to sweat, and mess up my rep
But imma tell 'em, to act like a Porshce step
Playin' me close, I think that's mental
Stick to the mic like an octopus tentacles
Dust MC's, observe, and start learnin'
Stompin' MC's out, with my earnest
Comin' off awesome like a world premiere
Bringin' crazy noise to the hemisphere
Rollin' on suckas, like a guided missle
Shis Kebab MC's, until they like sizzle
Listen up, this is a fact from a friend you know
Why, 'cause you can't wet
Now I have a chance to prove myself
You be reachin' for the Stezo on the top shelf
Comin' like a Mack truck, convoy
Me and Jimmy Slice, is makin' crazy noise

[Verse 2]
Adios, amigos, better known as see you later
I grab the mic like the jaws of an alligator
My name is Stezo-E and i'm makin' lots of pesos
And if you break down, i'm like Mecco
Me the teacher of the talent, the answer of the question
The preacher of the whole rap obsession
I'm fact not fiction, you're fiction not fact
I'm here to freshin' up the plesh, just like a little Tic Tac
O.K., O.K, O.K., I understand what you're gettin' to
The beat is not hard enough, it's not hittin' you
Rap is my employment, rhymes is my enjoyment
If you wanna battle, yo, set up an appointment
Serious rapper, takin' out the enemy
Just remember, yo, you're not the winner, G
Come on, come on, come on, and keep quiet
Sit back, and tape a rap geist
Stezo-E, that's the title
That's why the beat so vital
Now it's time to take out all the toys
You know why, we're makin' crazy noise

[Verse 3]
Hold it, wait a minute, just pause and just listen
As you all know, rappin' is my tradition
My exquisite, unique style I am creatin'
Yo, to battle me suckas, you brothers baitin'
The intelligent force I think of in my brain cell
Then I start to rhyme, my intelligence dwells
There's smartness, after smartness, after smartness
I couldn't see myself to depart this
You wanna be dumb, yo, you're not sightful
Suckas, you're like a .22, i'm like a rifle
I'm the S the T the E the Z-O
To preform, you know it's strictly a show
I got my dancers, my DJ, my mic, and my music
If I think of somethin' fly, of course i'm gonna use it
Backin' me up, is all of my boys
You know why, we're makin' crazy noise
