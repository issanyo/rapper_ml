[Hook: Stezo]

Everybody wants to know what happened
Everybody wants to know what's goin' on
Everybody wants to know what happened
Everybody wants to know what's goin' on
Everybody wants to know what happened
Everybody wants to know what's goin' on
Everybody wants to know what happened
Everybody wants to knnooowww



[Verse 1: Stezo]

Now this is for the chumps, yo
Who thought I was sleepin', yo
But now it's my album and my tape that you're peepin'
You thought I was whacked out, finished and strugglin'
But I was a street kid, on my block jugglin'
Tryin' ta make a buck to feed my fam-ily
Watchin' my back and making sure they wouldn't vamp me
It was hard bein' a product of the ghetto
I jumped on my baha bike and had to pedal
So, I, cruised the block and brothers illin' me badly
Yo me and my 9, illin' them back gladly
I'm ready for beef, or hear a smart remark
And then you'll see the 9mm spark
'Cause there's no way I'm gonna let myself die
'Cause I'm put on this earth, for a purpose, 'cause I'm here to survive


[Chorus: Earth Wind & Fire/Stezo]

Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star
(Cause I'm a shinin' star)
Shinin' Star for you to see, shinin' star
(Whose the shinin' star?)
Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star
(I'm the shinin' star)
Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star

[Verse 2: Stezo]

Now it was rough, I had to get myself together
I had no choice but to write rhymes that's better
Than my last album back in '89
Got with K.I.D., he said "Yo let's sign"
Then the first single came and I hit
But now all of my old friends are back on the dilsnick
'Cause when I was a star, then my name faded
Stezo was a name in town that was hated
When I was Stephen, not that kid Stezo
I had some trouble, they said "Oh that's deep," so
But now that my name is glorified and well known
You wishin' me bad luck and hell's my damn home
But when you're at the bottom all you can do is rise
'Cause I'm a true trooper and I'm here to survive

[Chorus: Earth Wind & Fire/Stezo]

Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star
(Cause I'm a shinin' star)
Shinin' Star for you to see, shinin' star
(Whose the shinin' star?)
Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star
(I'm the shinin' star)
Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star

[Verse 3: Stezo]

Now here's the third verse
Hey, yo, it's just for you chicks (huh)
You was livin' foul and you thought you were slick
Because I used to cruise right by in my volvo
And girls would scream "Stezo," I go "Oh no"
You really want me 'cause my name is popular
And then when I'm broke, and played out, you'll be droppin' theâ€”
Stezo piece of me, though, I'm not a peep show
Yo, you think you'll just find the open key hole, no
I'm not the one to be played sweet, just step on me (huh)
You're finna have swollen feet
Funny ain't it? It ain't funny to an artist
Then she says "The kid thinks he's a Goddess"
Don't tell the girls, yo, a whole bunch of lies
But then I gotta struggle 'cause I'm here to survive
Uh, like that ya'll, uh like that ya'll
Uh, like that ya'll, uh like that ya'll

[Chorus: Earth Wind & Fire/Stezo]

Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star
(Cause I'm a shinin' star)
Shinin' Star for you to see, shinin' star
(Whose the shinin' star?)
Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star
(I'm the shinin' star)
Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star

[Hook: Stezo]

Everybody wants to know what happened
Everybody wants to know what's goin' on
Everybody wants to know what happened
Everybody wants to know what's goin' on
Everybody wants to know what happened
Everybody wants to know what's goin' on
Everybody wants to know what happened
Everybody wants to knnooowww

[Chorus: Earth Wind & Fire/Stezo]

Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star
(Cause I'm a shinin' star)
Shinin' Star for you to see, shinin' star
(Whose the shinin' star?)
Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star
(I'm the shinin' star)
Shinin' star for you to see, shinin' star (for-for)

[Outro: Stezo]

Mad shouts to the Death Squad
My man E-Double, Redman, Keith Murray
Can't forget the Awesome Two, Shades Of Lingo, The OK KID
My man Erin, HP, Chris Lowe, Funk Master Flex
And my right hand man, Syndrome
That's how we end things in the 90 oh 95, talkin' mad jive
