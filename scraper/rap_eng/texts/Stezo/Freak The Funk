Yeaaah!

Once upon a time I had a trade
Thinkin' of a master plan to get paid
I got a paper and pencil
Thinkin' of rhymes, like mental
I went on and on it wouldn't stop
Then I got the hang of it, it was hip-hop
I started rollin' and flowin' with the tempo
Sat and I thought, yo it's all simple
I just wrote and wrote and wrote a portion
Put it on track, yo it was scorchin'
Put the funk and made the beat standout
All I heard from the crowds was shout
Goin' wild from left to right
I knew I had this party rockin' all night
Heard a brother scream out yo it's junk!
Man, you're crazy, cause I freak the funk

Yeaaah!

Yeaaah!

Kosher, let the rhyme just sway through
Listen to what I'm 'bout to say to you
I make rappers, wanna give up
And sit back while they watch me live it up
God bless, yes I'm creative
Born in Brooklyn so you know I'm a native
Takin' MCs to the border
Hit the finish line and give orders
Funk, something you can make up
And if not, please don't you flake up
I'm real, not the one flakin'
Just because I'm light-skinned you think I can be taken?
No way Jose, let me speak
With the exquisite style that is unique
Don't play me like a punk
I'm not a sucker, 'cause I freak the funk

Yeaaah!

Yeaaah!

I told ya, but you never did listen
Now I got the chance to start dissin'
Instead of dissin' I'ma go through it
Check it out, as I start to do it
I'm the man, with the plan, to make you stand
Get up and clap your hands
Prove to you what I can do 'cause we're the crew
So won't you just shoo
Don't you play 'cause I'ma stay, stand in my way
That's the price you pay
Slammin' like [?] for the dunk
'Cause I freak the funk

Yeaaah!

Yeaaah!

Yeaaah!

Yeaaah!

Yeaaah!

Yeaaah!

Yeaaah!

Yeaaah!
