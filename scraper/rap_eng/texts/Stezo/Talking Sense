[Verse 1]
Kings may come, and kings may go
Put yo, it's time for the Stezo to flow
Jay Slice is on the (Cut, Cut)
So let's start it
It's time to (Get retarded)
Me and my man, on the side, backin' me up
And if you come in my face i'm smackin' him up
And if you try to roll i'm jackin' him up
And after that, yo, i'm packin' 'em up
A vigilante rapper, killin' and collectin'
After this song is finished, you be respectin'
Stezo lead the man in , fire like a cannon
Instead of buckwillin', i'm gettin' tannin'
Teachers, while i'm the substitute
You're be termininated, so give a salute
Like a yield sign, slow down and keep caution
Like Diana, i'm the one bossin'
Take it as a threat, take it the way you wanna
Either way you take it, you know you're just gonna
End up in prison on the other side of the fence
You know why, i'm talking sense

[Verse 2]
I feel it, and it's a good sensation
Like a 2 year old child, doing her shoe lacin'
I'm talented, and like everything I invent
Keep the cash flow flowin', and payin' the rent
I invent, with the power of a sorcerer
They call me Stezo, E, and i'm the torturer
And I claim, everything from the grain
And all the negative stuff, is bein' drained
Stop it, yes it's science, i'm droppin' it
There ain't an MC out there that can mop it
I'm blessed with the gift, and the music is hype
Knock a human out once, and say good night
When i'm talkin' sense, I mean intelligence
And all that stuff you're sayin' is irrelevant
I'm not bein' Einstein or a scientist
You play with me, yo, play at your own risk
Just listen to what comes out my vent
You know why, i'm talking sense

[Verse 3]
People gather around like it's a ritual seance
Listen to the mic control as I spray chaos
MC wish me, like I'm a god, idol
This, nonbelievers, is served the non sightful
Girlies talkin' bullets, that my life
'Cause that's what I chose for the sacrifice
Breakin' wise on the rhythm, 'cause the beat's so frantic
Rockin' the mic, for Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics
Shootin' the rhymes, so they come out clear
Devastated to your mind, right from the ear
Rhyme staged, like a bull on a rampage
Not a old school, but a new age
A style, that makes it so illy
So get on the dance floor from night and tilly
I, tell the DJ, to commence
And pick up the mic, and talk sense
