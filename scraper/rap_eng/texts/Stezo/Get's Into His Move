[Verse 1]
Check 1-2 and you don't quit
My name is Stezo, and i'm the ultimate
Rhymes is my job and rap is my hobby
I don't know why, all the girls want to mob me
Yo, it's really makin' me sick
Yo, Jim, what you think? (Yo they on the tip!)
It really doesn't matter, 'cause nah, i'm not conceded
A lucky MC, with the title "undefeated"
Trample through the crowd, like a bull on a rampage
Rockin' for the youngsters, and the old age
Yeah, it's me the S -O bustin' vessels
Breakin' MC's down to just one decimal
A colonel of an army, better yet a general
Good to your health, so won't you call me Mr. Mineral
Born to be the chosen one to work
Gettin' ill on the microphone, goin' berzerk
Chill, and get into the groove
While Stezo-E gets ill, and get's into his move

[Verse 2]
Stand up, y'all, I want attention
You're in my class and you're stayin' for detention
I want you, and you, and you, and you to
And now it's time to drop some damn voodoo
I be creatin' is what I do the best in
You wanna battle, me, Smith & Wesson?
Keep the feelin' in your body, start to motivate
As the exquisite one, starts to create
'Cause i'm awesome, and ain't nothin' gonna block me
The only thing I can predict, is they'll drop me
Faster, faster, even slower than slow
Rock a crowd of my own color, like Billie Joe
Yo, my name is Stezo and i'm goin' for mine
Gettin' stupider and stupider, line after line
Gettin' ill to the funky groove
Just lounge y'all, as I get into my move

[Verse 3]
Well, listen up, as I tell you this
'Cause i'm the MC who can rock the stupidest
Takin' no shorts, you know why?
'Cause i'm Stezo
The type of car I drive, a Benz-Diesel
But now it's back, to the subject and the answer
I'm rhymin' now, I used to be a dancer
Yo, let's get to the funky stuff
Stezo-E, that's me, gettin' real rough
Stezo-E is just a kid gettin' busy
And now it's time to make you other rappers very lizzy
You think i'm lyin', well listen to this, my friend
You go against this, there is no way you will win
I love it, I love it, when they try to copy
But then I say, "See, you're sloppy, G."
I used to dream and dream, but I stopped that
You hold the mic in front of me, yo, i'll drop that
Yo, my name is Stezo gettin' smooth
Yo, chill, while I get into my move
