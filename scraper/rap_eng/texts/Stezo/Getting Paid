[Verse 1]
Step back, and watch Stezo-E start this
The newest rapper, a new artist
Makin' the cash flow, clockin' all the dollars
You can't win against me, so why bother?
I came to make my name like official
You know the dollar signs, that's my initial
I'm gettin' paid, on the drop of a dime
Everything is mine, so stand in line
So wait your turn, it's time to earn
Excuse me, this court is adjourned
Walkin' down the street, with my fly dookie cables
Make sure the scenery is like stables
Keep steppin', right to Apollo
Yo, I'm in back, it's my friends I follow
The whole clan got funky phase
We're coolin', we're gettin' paid

[Verse 2]
Well I'm back, on the subjects of presidents
Gettin' paid, coolin' in the residence
Sittin' home, waitin' for a show
The telephone rings, and then it's time to go
Jump on a plane, and head down south
Yo, i'm dreamin' about, how i'm gonna turn it out
Let the people see, the real true Stezo
Pumpin' up the crowd, like i'm diesel
Makin' the girls go crazy
Guys sayin', "Stezo, you amaze me"
It's O.K., 'cause i'm here to entertain
And funky music, I'm fillin your brain with
So relax, and let your body lay low
While I explain, how to make pesos
Put your mind into it, and have a trade
Look at us troop, we're gettin' paid

[Verse 3]
Yo, Chris, and Jim Slice, they're my DJ's
And after shows, yo, they get a big raise
It's time to get paid in '89
Check out the new rapper startin' to shine
I'm the S and the T and E and the Z-O
Just a Pisces, not a Leo
And if you look at the sun, it's dedicated
I took a D home and had it medicated
On wax, introduced to the DJ's
And if you can't relate, you you're Pre-K
Just remember, what I said
I'm gettin' presidents, yo, that are already dead
Plain and simple, I got it made
Like the title of the jam, i'm gettin' paid
