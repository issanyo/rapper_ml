[Verse 1]
Come on, everybody start partying down
To the funky sounds
Put your body in motion, while Stezo flaunts his new potion
Comin' on strong, like i'm lifting weights
Makin' you dance, from state to state
Yawnin', the speed is hypnosis
I'm givin' you, some doses
So, act fool, on the floor
This ain't it, ask for more
This beat is boombastic
As a matter of fact, it's smashin'
Keep the crowd uptempo
It's tracks and beats, it's simple
Yo, it ain't nothin' to it
So put your body into it, and do it like this
And do it like this

[Verse 2]
Foolish immortals, who try to jump my style
It's not worth your while
Let it be known that i'm the one rappin'
It is the funky track, that is happenin'
I'm, yes, the inventor
Got your track, in the center
Somethin', you can get with
And if not, then you're dismissed
Don't play me like a softie
Wake up, yo, smell the coffee
Won't you be realistic
This beat's the main statistic
Past the court and get charged
If cash is right, you live large
Scared to dance, come on and do it
And yo, put your body into it
And do it like this
And do it like this

[Verse 3]
Get up, get loose and get ready
It's time, to get sweaty
Make yourself real useful
'Cause this beat hits real crucial
Forcin' you to get up
Look at the floor, it just lit up
I'm the man, makin' a stand
Makin' ya party, and just clap your hands
Don't let the jam fool you
I'm here to preach and school you
Take it from me, i'm a dancer
Yes, to give you the chance of
To rock, like you never did before
You know what, I got a lot in store
Don't give up, just try to do it
And put your body into it
And do it like this
And do it like this
