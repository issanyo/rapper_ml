[Verse 1]
O.K., wait a minute
Now my intro's swift
Make the circle back, and let me shoot the gift
It's time for Steve to get funky
I'm flippin' on MC's like monkeys
But it's O.K., imma get mine
Maybe in the future, maybe in no time
All it takes is a second
I track and rhyme, and put it on a record
It depends the way you rock it
If you come on strong, the people will jock it
Keep tryin', go for your goals
But if you give up quick, you'll be left in the cold
Go for what you know, you're bound to succeed
Eventually, you'll take the lead
Sit at the table, and write some rhymes
Like I did, that's why I'm going for mine

[Verse 2]
One day, I said, thought to myself
Off of rap music, I could get a lot of wealth
With wealth comes a lot of fame
If you got the talent, and you got the brains
Just do it, it's not hard to do
You can go solo, or form a crew
Reach the top and go for what you know
And suddenly, you'll find yourself doin' shows
Gettin' paid, money's no problem
And financially, your wallet will solve them
On your way to the top, it's easy
Go on tour, and all the girls say "Skeeze Me"
It's funny, 'cause it may seem
Life and fame ain't nothin' but a dream
Like a light, I'm startin' to shine
'Cause I kept that thought that I'm goin' for mine

[Verse 3]
Well imma end this rhyme, with one more verse
But just remember my brother, I am first
In the rap industry, I'm takin' over
I'm high class, your class is lower
Dance to this, dance to that
Yo, regardless, whether you're skinny or fat
Get off your A-S-S and just listen to the sound
As I start the party, people gettin' down
No, there's no fight, and put a cease to the violence
And when I'm rhymin', all I want to hear is silence
Now I'm top singin' funky rhymes
Like I said in the first verse, i'm goin' for mine
