[Verse 1]
Hold it, I take a beat and like fold it
Put the lyrics together and then mold it
All together, it adds up to dopeness
So, I'm just hopin' you can cope with
Another sample of dope, known as a masterpiece
I lay it on the table, and start the feast
Mmmm, start eatin' it up
While my DJ Chris starts beatin' it up
As the beat goes on, and on, in the distance, wrong
Nothin' but the bass, just hittin' ya
And the style of music is fittin' ya
Stezo, the one who conducted it
Down in the basement, I construct it
Let me pause, and clear my throat with Halls
Back to the subject bein' born
Yo Chris, and Jim Slice, bring the horns

[Verse 2]
Stoppin' your step, one more step, you won't be steppin'
Then you're gonna cause me, to pull the weapon
But now i'm back to attack all enemies
And any sucka, who's not a friend of me
So just remember the thought that i'm thinkin'
Yo Chris, what's this beat (Yo, this beat is beat is stinkin')
Nothin' but the bass, in your face
On your case, drivin' you in a disgrace
To match the blastin' MC's
There ain't another rapper who can mess with these
Rhymes, they flow on, they flow on
Take a needle and thread and start to sew on
Bashin' and smashin' MC's who like roll up
Pull out the toolie, i'm foolies, and like hold up
Leavin' you rappers in rips and torns
And lay back while my DJ Chris
Brings the horns

[Verse 3]
Pause, for the cause, and let me run it
Man, I heard you whisper and now you done done it
The title, that I hold is much higher
Tearin' MC's up just like a paper fire
Rushin' em, and i'm flushin' em, down a toilet
No matter what you do, you still can't spoil it
'Cause i'm the member of the rap industry
And the tracks, and the mix, and Paul C
Cuttin' it up on the turns is Chris Cosby
And all DJ's, that his job, see
I'm just inventin' the style that is awesome
And if you come my way, I like toss 'em
I ain't havin' it cheif, so step naught
I put you in place, and the place if fought
Can't be touched, 'cause my mic is like a thorn
Peace to the brothers, bringin' the horns
