[Intro]
Yo!
Its your boy!
Daddy Yankee!
All my latinos stand up!
Marcando la historia
Caminen conmigo en esta!
Holla back
You know how we do man!

[Hook]
Cause you're the only one for me
(all I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel
(all I want is a girl like you)
Cause you're the only one for me
(all I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel
(all I want is a girl like you)

[Verse 1]
Straight up is your bad ass baby you hot
In the hood you feel tension when you walk down the block
Thats the reason you in my head stop believe it or not
Me and you can run the world like big pun and pac
Cause you my main homie my main shorty
Cock back hammers and bang homie protecting our gauge slowly
With a girl like you forget the nonsense
We peeps don't give a fuck about the chicos and gossip
Dile!

Daddy Yankee you shining right now
Come on cop me now I got this game locked down
What you know about big things chrome wheels own deals
Me and you holding it down its all real
Come on!

[Hook]
Cause you're the only one for me
(all I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel
(all I want is a girl like you)
Cause you're the only one for me
(all I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel
(all I want is a girl like you)

[Verse 2]
Yo!
La negra tiene tumba'o
Cuando camina de la'o
Por la calle ocho sin miedo we be wildin out
Switching lanes on the freeway corriendo por miles
A little foreplay like Bonnie and Clyde en el crimen
Flossing jewels is not a felony
How am I a playa ma?
Do I look like bill bellamy
No te molestes yo soy tuyo na'a mas
(Ha!)
I'm not a player I just crush a lot
Come on!

[Hook]
Tu eres la chica ideal para mi
(all I want is a girl like you)
Como tu nadie me a hecho sentire
(all I want is a girl like you)
Cause you're the only one for me
(all I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel
(all I want is a girl like you)

Oh oh oh
(all I want is a girl like you)
Oh oh oh
(all I want is a boy like you)
Oh oh oh
(all I want is a girl like you)
Oh oh oh
(all I want is a boy like you)

Cause you're the only one for me
(all I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel
(all I want is a girl like you)
Cause you're the only one for me
(all I want is a girl like you)
It's the way that you make me feel
(all I want is a girl like you)

[Hook]
Yeah!
All my latinos stand up!
Caminen conmigo!
On the floor bussing
Daddy yankee!
Barrio fino!
And I'm proud to be latin man
Letting you know what's the real
King of the jungle!
Ha ha
