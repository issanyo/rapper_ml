[Intro: Daddy Yankee]
Janet Jackson
Iconic
Daddy

[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
If you're livin' for the moment
Don't stop, and celebrate the feelin'
Go up, if you're livin' for the moment
Don't stop, 'cause there ain't no ceilings
Go up

[Chorus: Janet Jackson & Daddy Yankee]
We're made for now
Not tomorrow
Made for now
Look around
We're made for now
Not tomorrow
Made for now (uno)
Look around (dos, tres)
We're made for now (fuego)

[Post-Chorus: Daddy Yankee & Janet Jackson]
Everybody move your body, everybody
Everybody move your body, everybody (right now)
We're made for now
Everybody move your body (right now), everybody (right now)
Everybody move your body (right now), everybody

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson & Daddy Yankee]
If you're livin' for the moment
Don't stop, try to celebrate the feelin'
Go up, if you're livin' for the moment (the moment, baby)
Don't stop, 'cause I break those ceilings
Go up

[Pre-Chorus: Janet Jackson]
Love is in the rhythm now, we're
Dancing with a whole new meaning
Love is on the way to fill you up

[Chorus: Janet Jackson & Daddy Yankee]
We're made for now
Not tomorrow
Made for now
Look around
We're made for now
Not tomorrow
Made for now (uno)
Look around (dos, tres)
We're made for now (fuego)

[Post-Chorus: Daddy Yankee & Janet Jackson]
Everybody move your body (woo), everybody
Everybody move your body, everybody (right now)
We're made for now
Everybody move your body (right now), everybody (right now)
Everybody move your body (right now), everybody (right now)

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
We're made for now
Not tomorrow
Made for now
Look around
We're made for now (right now, right now)
Made for now (right now)
Right now (right now)

[Verse 3: Daddy Yankee]
Arriba la raza, estamos en la casa
Dale suelta en banda to' lo que te atrasa
Muévete eso rápi-rápido
Muévete eso rápi-rápido
We don't stop it, no te escapas
Yo soy volcán pero tú eres lava
Seguimos lighty, lighty, prendí'os
Vívelo hoy, que mañana se acaba

[Bridge: Janet Jackson]
Right now
Not tomorrow
Made for now (right now)
Look around
They're made for now (right now)
Not tomorrow
Made for now
Look around

[Chorus: Janet Jackson & Daddy Yankee]
We're made for now
Not tomorrow
Made for now (sube)
Look around
We're made for now
Not tomorrow
Made for now
Look around
We're made for now

[Post-Chorus: Daddy Yankee & Janet Jackson]
Everybody move your body (right now), everybody (right now)
We're made for now
Everybody move your body (right now), everybody (right now)
We're made for now
Da una vuelta y ponte pa' mí (right now), ponte pa' mí (right now) (Ponte, ponte, ponte)
We're made for now
Da una vuelta y ponte pa' mí (right now), ponte pa' mí (right now)
We're made for now

[Outro: Janet Jackson & Daddy Yankee]
Made for now
Not tomorrow
Made for now (Janet Jackson)
Look around
