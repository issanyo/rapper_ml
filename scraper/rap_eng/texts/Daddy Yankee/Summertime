In the summer, I wake up feeling brand new
In the summer I always find that crazy love
In the summer I'm gonna act a damn fool
I just can't wait to-to-to let it go
Ooh let it go oo-oo
Let it go, let it go
Let it go-go-go-go
I've seen the top of the world
But not gonna take it higher
Swear I never felt so strong
Looking down on my empire
I swept het off her feet I'm noticing
She felt for papi
La cuenta '
I got the feeling that you feel me baby
Wait a minute
Honeymoon with out a wedding
Now is you with, with it?
No romantic, we were dirty dancing
'Till the sun come rising
Like a champagne glasses
Just one moment but it's everlasting
So turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
It's the time of the year that we burn it up
In the summer, I wake up feeling brand new
In the summer I always find that crazy love
In the summer I'm gonna act a damn fool
I just can't wait to-to-to let it go
Ooh let it go oo-oo
Let it go, let it go
Let it go-go-go-go
Baby ca I get with you
I know you feel my ambition
You see me spending all of this money
Cause one day I know I'll be rich
'
Caliente, caliente
...
No lo piesnsas '
Take another shot and loose you top cause this is hot
Then you'll flip the bottle up and take a shot
Never stop baby
Take another shot and loose you top cause this is hot
Then you'll flip the bottle up and take a shot
No romantic, we were dirty dancing
'Till the sun come rising
Like a champagne glasses
Just one moment but it's everlasting
So turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
Put your hands up it's time to sunlight
Get up just dance into the moon light
Put your hands up it's time to sunlight
Get up just dance into the moon light
In the summer, I wake up feeling brand new
In the summer I always find that crazy love
In the summer I'm gonna act a damn fool
I just can't wait to-to-to let it go
Ooh let it go oo-oo
Let it go, let it go
Let it go-go-go-go
