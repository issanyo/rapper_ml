Come and fall back
Limbo! Keep movin' your feet
And get low
Drop and do the limbo!

Come and fall back
Limbo! Keep movin' your feet
And get low
Drop and do the limbo!
Limbo!

Give it up for the summer time
Come on, come, come on one more time!
Pa' pasarla caliente, it's time to go crazy
Yo, DJ, let it run
It's so hot under the sun
We wanna turn it up!

Give it up for the summer time
Come on, come, come on one more time!
Pa' bailarlo caliente, not stoppin', my baby
Yo, DJ, let it run
It's so hot under the sun
We wanna turn it up!

Zu-zu-zumba!

Here we go!
Take it down!
