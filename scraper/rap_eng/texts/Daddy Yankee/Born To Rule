[Intro: Varys]
Power is a curious thing
Who lives, who dies
Power resides where men believes it resides
It's a trick, a shadow on the wall

[Verse 1]
I'm on my game as the king, come and kiss the ring
On top of the chain and can't go against the grain
They trying to tame, but they can't contain us
They want my throne, they making arrangements
Can't take my greatness
You lose some and you win some, but I win all of my kingdom
And carry on with my empire with lawyers, soldiers and wisdom
Winter's coming, watch the fall, I'm cold-hearted and built for war
They say what was dead may never die, today [?] you gon' break the wall

[Hook]
I was born to rule the world, victories now be gone
Hear the power in my word, You ain't got nowhere to run
You ain't got nowhere to run

[Verse 2]
Somos lo que somos, nadie se va quedar con mi trono.
Le caigo a tu reino, conquisto y me corono
Es hierba, la sangre pesa sobre la hierba
El infierno en la tierra, es sinonimo de guerra
Yo soy el rey, entendeis, mi palabra es ley
I can bring the pain, like a storm, you get flood and rain
Steel pulse, iron tears
Got chosen, reason why they put me here
Yeah

[Hook]
I was born to rule the world, victories now be gone
Hear the power in my word, You ain't got nowhere to run
You ain't got nowhere to run
