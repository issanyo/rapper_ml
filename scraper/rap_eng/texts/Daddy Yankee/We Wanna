[Chorus: Alexandra Stan]
We wanna dance 'till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance, it's about to go

[Post-Chorus: Alexandra Stan]
It's 'bout to go!
Hey!
'Bout to go!
Hey
It's 'bout to go!

[Verse 1: Alexandra Stan]
Down in the rough part of town
There's an epidemic goin' around
I get the fever when I hear that sound
I can't help it, I gotta move right now
When I hit the drums start to play
I let my body run away
I wanna party like everyday
If you're with me let me hear you say

[Pre-Chorus: Alexandra Stan + INNA]
Do we wanna stop it? No way!
Do we let the cops in? No way!
We about to rock this whole place
What do we want?

[Chorus: Alexandra Stan]
We wanna dance 'till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance, it's about to go

[Post-Chorus: Alexandra Stan + INNA]
It's 'bout to go!
Hey
'Bout to go!
Hey!
It's 'bout to go!
Hey
'Bout to go!
Hey!
It's 'bout to go!

[Verse 1: INNA]
Down in the rough part of town
There's an epidemic goin' around
I get the fever when I hear that sound
I can't help it, I gotta move right now
When I hit the drums start to play
I let my body run away
I wanna party like everyday
If you're with me let me hear you say

[Pre-Chorus: INNA + Alexandra Stan]
Do we wanna stop it? No way!
Do we let the cops in? No way!
We about to rock this whole place
What do we want?

[Chorus: INNA]
We wanna dance 'till we can't no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance, it's about to go

[Post-Chorus: Alexandra Stan + INNA]
It's 'bout to go!
Hey!
'Bout to go!
Hey!
It's 'bout to go!
Hey!
'Bout to go!

[Verse 2: Daddy Yankee]
The-the-the-they call me Jefe, baby
I see you be lookin' like "Daddy, come get it"
I'm with it already, you better get busy
So city to city, the girls that's pretty
Get down, down, down, down
Say more, one, two, three to the four
Mami, move it, like you're tryna make it on the tour
But you're the only one that got me on the trippin'
Like the words in my hands, but they're really on the hips, ah
Perdóname ya el drama, se ve potential
Del máximo líder del party mundial
Waio, on your back, we'll end it
Hands up like you know I'm a bandit, Jefe

[Bridge: Alexandra Stan + INNA]
Hey!
'Bout to go!
Hey!
We wanna
Hey!
'Bout to go!

[Chorus: INNA + Alexandra Stan]
We wanna dance 'till we can no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance, it's about to go

[Chorus: Alexandra Stan + INNA]
We wanna dance 'till we can no more
We wanna love with the lights down low
From Argentina to Morocco
We wanna dance, it's about to go

[Outro: Alexandra Stan + INNA]
It's 'bout to go
