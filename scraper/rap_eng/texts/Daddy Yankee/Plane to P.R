[Letra de "Plane to P.R." ft. will.i.am]

[Intro: Daddy Yankee]
Damas y caballeros
Están escuchando a los mundialmente aclamados
Daddy Yankee, will.i.am
Come on!

Here we go now, here we go now
Here we go now, here we go now
Yeah, here we go now, here we go now
Here we go now, yeah, here we go now

And let's rock with it, let's rock with it
Let's rock, let's rock, let's rock with it
And let's rock with it, let's rock with it
Let's rock, nos fuimos lejos, come on!

[Coro: will.i.am, Daddy Yankee]
I'm gonna hop on a plane to PR
I'm gonna hop on a plane to PR
They got hot lil' mamacitas
They got hot lil' mamacitas

You gonna drop all down to PR
You gonna drop all down to PR
We got nice lil' señoritas
We got nice lil' señoritas

[Post-Coro: will.i.am, Daddy Yankee]
I know you see all them pretty mammas, see all them pretty mammas
See all them pretty mammas, see all them pretty mammas
Up in the house, up in the house
Up in the house, up-up in the house
I know you see all them sexy ladies, see all them sexy ladies
See all them sexy ladies, see all them sexy ladies
Shaking their ass, shaking their ass
Shaking their ass, sha-shaking their ass

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
I'm your idol, your highest title, numero uno
Yes I'm Puerto Rican, but I'm speaking so that you know, mai'
Arroz con habichuela siempre, you know, mai'
Los que se tiran la tela fina, you know, mai'
Welcome to mi casa, la melaza
Donde las mujeres son una amenaza
La cuna del reggaeton y la salsa
Jode con mi música a ver lo que pasa
In your eyes I can see looking at me and it happens every day
'Cause I'm young and I'm brown and I thought this way
They might think I'm Carlito's Way
Man, give me a break
Don't try to push me, 'cause I cut my hair (No te calles, dile)
If you dont feel me, your soul must be dead (Come on!)

[Coro: will.i.am, Daddy Yankee]
I'm gonna hop on a plane to PR
I'm gonna hop on a plane to PR
They got hot lil' mamacitas
They got hot lil' mamacitas

You gonna drop all down to PR
You gonna drop all down to PR
We got nice lil' señoritas
We got nice lil' señoritas

[Post-Coro: will.i.am, Daddy Yankee]
I know you see all them pretty mammas, see all them pretty mammas
See all them pretty mammas, see all them pretty mammas
Up in the house, up in the house
Up in the house, up-up in the house
I know you see all them sexy ladies, see all them sexy ladies
See all them sexy ladies, see all them sexy ladies
Shaking their ass, shaking their ass
Shaking their ass, sha-shaking their ass

[Verso 2: will.i.am]
Take me down to PR, where the señoritas are
I can speak a lil' spanish too, ¿cómo está'?
¿Mami quieres bailar? Dime lo que quieres
I got a lil' fetish to be dancing with mujeres
Will.i.am chop up the funk like the shredders
When I'm done rocking they be like: "¿Qué hay, mi jefe?"
Black man raised in the hood with the esé
Mami tienes que pensar, be like: "Dame leche"
Dame, dame, dame, mami, mami, mami por favor
Porque esta cancién es reggaeton
Daddy Yankee, will.i.am, collaboration on
From PR to east coast rocking on and on
Aprende mi gente, negros, cafe
We fighting one another but I'm asking, ¿por qué?
'Cause latins like blacks, and blacks like latins
Let's stop fighting, start fucking, what's happening?

[Coro: will.i.am, Daddy Yankee]
I'm gonna hop on a plane to PR
I'm gonna hop on a plane to PR
They got hot lil' mamacitas
They got hot lil' mamacitas

You gonna drop all down to PR
You gonna drop all down to PR
We got nice lil' señoritas
We got nice lil' señoritas

[Post-Coro: will.i.am, Daddy Yankee]
I know you see all them pretty mammas, see all them pretty mammas
See all them pretty mammas, see all them pretty mammas
Up in the house, up in the house
Up in the house, up-up in the house
I know you see all them sexy ladies, see all them sexy ladies
See all them sexy ladies, see all them sexy ladies
Shaking their ass, shaking their ass
Shaking their ass, sha-shaking their ass

[Outro: Daddy Yankee, will.i.am]
Ye-Yeah, ye-yeah
You know who's this, Daddy!
Daddy Yankee, yo
Will.i.am collaboration
Cartel
The Big Boss, Daddy
Nosotros nos escuchamos en el mundo entero
Nos estan escuchando allá en Jupiter
I'm gonna hop
