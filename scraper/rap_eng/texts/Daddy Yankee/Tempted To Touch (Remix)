To all the ladies in the dance
I lose all control when I see you
Standing there in front of me
Your style, your clothes, your hair
You fair woman, you look so sexy
The way you wine and the way you dance
And the way that you twist and turn your waist
Leaves me wanting, leaves me yearning
Leaves me feeling for a taste
Before the end of the night
I wanna hold you so tight
You know I want you so much
And I'm so tempted to touch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch
To all the ladies in the dance
I don't even know your name
Little woman, I don't even know your age
But there's something about you girl
When I see you wining in front the stage
Please forgive me, please excuse me
But there's nothing else that a man can do
I cannot pass or think a woman
I just need to be next to you
Before the end of the night
I wanna hold you so tight
You know I want you so much
And I'm so tempted to touch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch
I wanna feel you, I wanna squeeze you
I wanna hug and kiss and caress you
I wanna love you, I wanna touch you
I'll place no one else above you
I wanna feel you, I wanna squeeze you
I wanna hug and kiss and caress you
I wanna love you, I wanna touch you
You know woman I wanna wings of a dove you
Before the end of the night
I wanna hold you so tight
You know I want you so much
And I'm so tempted to touch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch
Before the end of the night
I wanna hold you so tight
You know I want you so much
And I'm so tempted to touch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I need you so much
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Hey, little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch
