[Verse 1: Emelee]
I see you stare, which looking at by, he lives with no care
It's obvious that you want me to appear
Let's turn on the lights and I'll sing in your air

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Shake your body
Rock your body
We ain't stopping til the early morning
Shake your body
Rock your body
We ain't stopping til the early morning
Shake your body
Rock your body
We ain't stopping til the early morning
Shake your body
Rock your body
We ain't stopping til the early morning
Shake your body
Rock your body
We ain't stopping til the early morning

[Coro: Emelee, Daddy Yankee]
Let me lose control of your body (Candela)
Let me lose control (Ca-candela)
Let me lose control of your body (Ca-candela)
Let me lose control (Let's go)

Candela
Candela
Candela

[Verse 2: Daddy Yankee]
I'm in the place you never go
I get my bottles right along
Ya t√∫ sabes, soy Daddy, que paso?
Always on top and all alone
My money trees vienen easy
Por que yo rompo to' los beats
Compararme con alguien, chico please
Who the champ? You know I'm plenty heat
Tu sabes, the way that I'm riding I can't hit the brakes
Bought a new house, came with the lake
Estoy celebrando como to' un rey
Haters give me my space
Left hand on my bottle
Right hand in the air
Living life like I want to
Party like we don't care

[Verse 3: Emelee]
See in your eyes the simple seduction, it kills me inside
You got what i want it, and i want tonight
Let's turn on the lights and watch me come alive

[Coro: Emelee, Daddy Yankee]
Let me lose control of your body (Candela)
Let me lose control (Candela)
Let me lose control of your body (Candela)
Let me lose control (Vivo)

That's how we roll, rol
That's how we roll, rol

[Verse 4: Emelee]
(DY)
Okay, now who's controlling when we grind?
Whos's controlling when she rides?
Who's controlling the club tonight?
La botella de tequila Cartel, aight
Left hand on my bottle
Right hand in the air
Living life like I want to
Party like we don't care

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Shake your body
Rock your body
We ain't stopping til the early morning
Shake your body
Rock your body
We ain't stopping til the early morning
Shake your body
Rock your body
We ain't stopping til the early morning
Shake your body
Rock your body
We ain't stopping til the early morning

[Coro: Emelee, Daddy Yankee]
Let me lose control of your body (Candela)
Let me lose control (Candela)
Let me lose control of your body (Candela)
Let me lose control (Vivo)

That's how we roll, rol
That's how we roll, rol
