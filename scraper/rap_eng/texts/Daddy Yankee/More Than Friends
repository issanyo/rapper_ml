[Intro: Daddy Yankee]
DY, yo INNA, baby
Come, arriba, let's go now

[Pre-Chorus: INNA]
Whoa tonight
Tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight
Tonight we should be more than friends

[Verse 1: INNA]
We're in the corner of a crowded room
I want your lips your body, boy how soon?
And if you like what we're doin'
Why don't we give in for the night?
This might just be the night of you and I
If there's no distance in our hearts tonight
And if you like what we're doin'
Why don't we give in for the night?

[Pre-Chorus: INNA]
Whoa tonight
Tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight
Tonight we should be more than friends

[Chorus: INNA]
From the first time that I saw that I look in your eyes
I've been thinkin' about you for all of this time
Whoa tonight
Tonight we could be more than friends

[Verse 2: INNA]
Ain't looking for someone to call my own
But with you boy we're in the danger zone
And if you like what we're doin'
Why don't we give in for the night?
So here we are, I just dream of you
And all the things that I'm about to do to you
And if you like what we're doin'
Why don't we give in for the night?

[Pre-Chorus: INNA]
Whoa tonight
Tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight
Tonight we should be more than friends

[Chorus: INNA]
From the first time that I saw that I look in your eyes
I've been thinkin' about you for all of this time
Whoa tonight
Tonight we could be more than friends

[Verse 3: Daddy Yankee]
Baby, she rings my bell, and they rush the floor
You mighta think that's cool zaw
Everybody in the club was hot till I showed my watch
And they cooled out
Caliente! Frio! Todo eso que tu tiene es mio
Caliente! Frio! Todo eso que tu tiene es...
It's forever (Forever)
You could be mine
It's whatever (Whatever)
Whatever you like
It's forever (Forever)
You could be mine
And I'm needing you right now
Baby come and hold me down, ah
Caliente! Frio! Todo eso que tu tiene es mio

[Pre-Chorus: INNA]
Whoa tonight
Tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight
Tonight we should be more than friends

[Chorus: INNA]
From the first time that I saw that I look in your eyes
I've been thinkin' about you for all of this time
Whoa tonight
Tonight we could be more than friends
