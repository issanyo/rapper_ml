And I’m the self made millionaire, next stop billionaire
Ask ’em on the corner, I done made about a million there

Self made millionaire, next stop billionaire
El mundo me conoce ya

French Montana, en la big manzana

Do my thing papa, tattoos en la tata
Told her my name is Daddy, she call me the big papa
Puertorro gave me the heart, yeah

Self made but I’ve been paid
Tu no juegas like we play

Oh oh everywhere I go

In the hood they show me love
Oh oh everywhere I go
Llego con los mios, con un piquete cabrón
