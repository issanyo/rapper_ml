{Verse 1}
Yes, you know that I've been looking at you for a while
I want you to dance with me  tonight
I saw, that your eyes were already calling me
Show me now the way and i will go
You you are the magnet and I'm the metal
I'm getting closer setting up the plan
Just the thought of It accelerates my heart beat
Now I'm enjoying it more than usual
All my senses are asking now for more
This must be done with no hurry

{Chorus}
Slowly
I wanna to breathe your fire slowly
Let me whisper things in your ears
So that you remember when you're not with me
Slowly
I wanna to undress you with kisses slowly
Sign all the parts of you're body
I promise you that i’ll do it gently

{Verse 2}
I wanna see you dance
I wanna you to be my baby
I want to kiss you slowly
In all you’re favorite places
Let me go now into your danger zones
I will make you scream
Gonna have chills up to the bones

If i want a kiss come give it to me
I know that you're thinking about it
I’ve been trying for some time
Mommy this is giving it
You know that your heart does
Makes wanna boom boom
You know this is me baby
Looking for a boom boom

{Verse 3}
Come on and taste my month
And see what taste it has
I wanna see how much love do you have
I ‘m not in a hurry I will take my time
Let’s start slowly and then go wildly

Step by step little step by step
Baby don’t give up
Hold on to what you've got
You gotta keep on dancing and don't stop
You gotta keep on moving show me what you’ve got

Step by step little step by step
All i want to do is make love to  you
I wanna be a part, a part of you
Baby and tonight  is you're lucky night

{Chorus}
Slowly
I wanna to breathe your fire slowly
Let me whisper things in your ears
So that you remember when you're not with me
Slowly
I wanna to undress you with kisses slowly
Sign all the parts of you're body
I promise you that i’ll do it gently

{Bridge}
I wanna see you dance
I wanna you to be my baby
I want to kiss you slowly
In all you’re favorite places

Let me go now into your danger zones
I will make you scream
Gonna have chills up to the bones

{Chorus}
Slowly
I wanna to breathe your fire slowly
Let me whisper things in your ears
So that you remember when you're not with me
Slowly
I wanna to undress you with kisses slowly
Sign all the parts of you're body
I promise you that i’ll do it gently
