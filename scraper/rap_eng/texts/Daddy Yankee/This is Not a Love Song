[Intro: Daddy Yankee]
Feel so close to you right now
This is not a love song, no
More like I can’t get a love song, love
This is not a love song, song
I’m stuck here tryna function, no
This is not a love song, no
More like a lust to love song
Oh yeah, but this is not a love song

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]
Daddy Yankee mami, all I wanna bag that
Body booming like a bombing over Baghdad, word
Big Boss need a hash tag
Shawty let me show you
You know I double tap that
Now bring it back, now take it low
Now bring it back, now take it low
Can I get it, can I get it?
(Doctored Up!)
I’m a top boss, hit ‘em with the hot sauce
Top, seekin’ how I took her to the top floor
007 like I’m James bond
King Daddy feeling like I’m King Kong
Shawty on me, chuggin’ like she own one
Make the right move, bodies with the wrong one
I’m a Dom one, she ain’t in it for the long run
This is not a love song, baby would you give that?

[Hook: Daddy Yankee]
Feel so close to you right now
This is not a love song, no
More like I can’t get a love song, love
This is not a love song, song
I’m stuck here tryna function, love
This is not a love song, no
More like a lust to love song
Oh yeah, but this is not a love song

[Verse 2: Daddy Yankee]
All the models in the club wearing my logo
Booty bouncing like it’s jumping on the pogo
Lean, side to side like a cholo
Insane in the brain, not loco
Now bring it back, now take it low
Dale pa’ atras, muevelo
Dale sigue, can I get it?
(Doctored Up!)
When it comes to the game I’ll play you like none
Bitch tell your chick I’m Mr. Saigon
Shut ’til I hit that with the lights on
‘Cause we living like we gonna die young
Shout out to my DJ, got this shit on replay
Now I gotta, now I gotta, dancing in your B-Day
Come and get your present, get to know me better
First name gone, last name forever

[Hook: Daddy Yankee]
Feel so close to you right now
This is not a love song, no
More like I can’t get a love song, no
This is not a love song, song
I’m stuck here tryna function, love
This is not a love song, no
More like a lust to love song
Oh yeah, but this is not a love song
