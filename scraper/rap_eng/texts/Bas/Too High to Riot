[Intro]
I'm too high to riot, I'm too high to riot
I'm just too high to riot

[Verse 1]
I never lose sight
Got an eye on her thighs and an eye on horizons
Too much at stake, got no time for a date
Unless that date is with fate, got my eyes on the prize and
Its too occupant, you want a slice but it's too hot just pie it
You want a steak but it's too high to buy it
Me I be too high, I'm too high, I'm too high
I'm too high for games and I'm too high for liars
Fuck TSA cause I'm too high for flying
Fuck NSA cause them satellites too high. they do all the spying
Fuck all the leaders that's too high off power
They do all the lying and treat us like prisoners
I mean who is the enemy here?
You are or I am, but you are not real enough power
Despite all the dirt that you're doing
You do all in hiding, but I am no better
I can see all of your terrors
Still remain in quiet and wonder in private and silence
Like if I just speak on it, would the people go buy it?
Fuck it just do it for self, I am demand and supplier
I trial by fire, I am the man

[Hook]
But I'm too high to riot, I'm too high to riot
I'm just too high to riot
Bas you in the city?
Baby nah I'm on the road, Fiends
Pockets full of money left them all on the floor

[Verse 2]
Probably should have claimed all the hoes that I fucked on my customs declarations
Check the faces all through my crew, it's like every race
So to call me racist, is so fucking baseless
But until your nation apologize
I fuck a European bitch for every African nation they colonize
And Add us some commas there to follow my dollars sign
And boost up my bottom line
And you don't want to hear it fine, they used to make it a crime to fuck white women
But damn, better give me a lot of time
Free love, whole world mixed up fuck boy you out of time
So what could brown do for you? UPS nigga
I done flew up out the nest nigga
The world bigger than the block man thats why they killed Pac
Couldn't stop us, we still looking for the rest nigga
Fiends

[Hook]
But I'm too high to riot, I'm too high to riot
I'm just too high to riot
Bas you in the city?
Baby nah I'm on the road, Fiends
Pockets full of money left them all on the floor
Pockets full of money left them all on the floor
But I'm too high to riot, I'm too high to riot
I'm just too high to riot
