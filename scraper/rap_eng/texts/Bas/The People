[Verse 1]
A thousand dollars on one drink later
That bottle from my niggas
Drop knowledge on these hoes
Coke bottle from the figure
Top model when she pose
Bird brain always talking so what's so
Give a fuck about your past please be more current
Try to make waves you gone need more current
You should get you one of these
Heart bigger than a picture couldn't fit it on my sleeve
Hard regale got check, couldn't get me on my knees
Hard liquor, good sex, couldn't get you bitch to leave
Damn, I never said I'm the greatest, but I only get greater
Sixty cities off six teens just half for you later
I just laugh on my haters, you gonna have to excuse
You gone need a jujitsu to cut through half of my layers
I am like the rap Himalayas you can die at the peak
It's such a beautiful sky


[Verse 2]
You would die for a peak
I always saw it on a bigger scale than the most niggas
I try tell 'em but you can't tell most niggas
We on that Dohchay, Dohchay, Dohchay
Thats the killer, [?]
Since I've been high, I could always see high
Like a bee hive buzzing, did it whip my nigga
Really we like cousins annd if you see life frontin'
Gun it and chase that bitch but when you take that risk
It's a double xord my nigga hit the feds while he had to make that flip
I put the paper to lyrics make sure my crew full
That something useful
Make sure you make it the fruit fall
You want eat as much shit as you choose to

[Outro]
Shout out to by nigga Ron Gilmore
Nigga was like you need to rap on this beat
