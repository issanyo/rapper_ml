[Intro]
We made it
And I came in mad early
Nigga we made it
Fuckin' kick ain't even drop
We made it
Alright man that was fun
We made it
Nigga I'm faded

[Verse 1]
I still remember the cold of last winter the struggle was heavy
Cole was like I was just playin' your shit, you know Salaam Remi?
He fucked with your tape he was impressed just as soon as I played it
I was so geeked I turned to the fiends like nigga we made it
He told me just got an offer for you it came through it was No ID
Then we pulled up to the club in a truck but a nigga had no ID
He went online on his phone just to Google and show em my faces
My nigga when they let us in that bitch I was like nigga we made it
Shout out to Dion he tried to put me on I mean it I'm gracious
But we had a dream build a home for the team so man we couldn't take it
But just see you later man Cole hit me up and say Interscope paid us
I asked how much and he was like nigga we made it
The very next day nigga I hit the bank and I emptied my savings
Oh what a feeling to put this shit simply its simply amazing
Spoke to my pops he said damn I miss Paris I need a vacation
I sent him two tickets for him and the misses like nigga we made it
Tell mom I love her
