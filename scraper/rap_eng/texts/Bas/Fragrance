[Intro: Bas]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Same story, same hoe
Same thing, same Correy

[Chorus: Correy C]
I had her waiting, she was tryna go back to my location
She ain't no doctor, got no patience
Damn you smellin' good, I love your fragrance
God damn, you lookin' good, I had to snatch that (I had to snatch that)
God damn, you lookin' good, I had to smash that (I had to smash that)
But then you got annoying had to let you go (had to let you go)
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you know

[Verse 1: Bas]
Man this chick won't leave me lone, leave me lone yeah
I tried to put her on my bro, on my bro yeah
But she still came back, came back yeah
Damn she still came back, came back
No, I don't need shit, I'm good, I'm chillin'
No, I don't need shit, I'm good, I'm good
Treat the Backwood like a treasure map
Throw it back girl, I can handle that
But I ain't really tryna spend the time (no time)
Why you always blowin' up my line?
Why you always tryna get on my buzz?
Holla at my niggas, get off my nuts (oh God)

[Chorus: Correy C]
I had her waiting, she was tryna go back to my location
She ain't no doctor, got no patience
Damn you smellin' good, I love your fragrance
God damn, you lookin' good, I had to snatch that (I had to snatch that)
God damn, you lookin' good, I had to smash that (I had to smash that)
But then you got annoying had to let you go (had to let you go)
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you know

[Bridge: Correy C]
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you go
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you know
If I said it then I mean it, I had to let you go
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you know

[Verse 2: Bas]
She got tats like strippers, she got ass like strippers
She got sass, she got plans, she ain't ask for a picture
She know just what she came for (she know)
She got just what she came for (she did)
I'ma run it up, throw the dueces up, fuck we playin' all the games for?
I know the truth about you, we know the truth about you
You want money, fame, all the things the game brings, girl it's such a shame
But I ain't really tryna spend the time (no time)
Why you always blowin' up my line?
Why you always tryna get on my buzz?
Holla at my niggas, get off my nuts (oh God)

[Chorus: Correy C]
I had her waiting, she was tryna go back to my location
She ain't no doctor, got no patience
Damn you smellin' good, I love your fragrance
God damn, you lookin' good, I had to snatch that (I had to snatch that)
God damn, you lookin' good, I had to smash that (I had to smash that)
But then you got annoying had to let you go (had to let you go)
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you know

[Outro: Correy C]
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you go
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you know
If I said it then I meant it, I had to let you go
It was you, it wasn't me, I had to let you know
