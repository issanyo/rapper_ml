[Chorus]
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better

[Bridge]
We should go and make a baby
You been patient, you deserve me on the daily
You ain't really with the beggin'
You know better than be talkin' to me crazy
We should go and make a baby
You been patient, you deserve me on the daily
You ain't really with the beggin'
You know better than be talkin' to me crazy

[Chorus]
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better

[Verse]
'Cause you know this, yeah you know this
I ain't one for being bogus
Got this weight up on my shoulders
Girl you treat me like a bogey
I've been stressed out, keep me stress free
You've been waitin' for me so long
Couple days I had to prolong, hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
You know better, you know better
You know better, you know better
