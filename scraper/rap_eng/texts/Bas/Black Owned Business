[Verse 1]
You never thought I'd make it this far, did you
You always had to make it hard for me
But I'm a motherfuckin' star, bitch didn't you know?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
My brother Ib told me some niggas just wanna be safe
And some niggas just wanna be great
Which one are you? Let's go make history today
Let's go make history today
Boy use your brain, only your heart can lead
You'll figure your way man, this shit ain't for me to say
I come, I love until my heart can't bleed
I'm on the road, I guess it ain't meant for me to stay
But I'm here with you

[Hook]
I'm here with you
I'm here with you
I'm here with you

[Verse 2]
Hey world, your favorite movie is on, it's called Attack on Niggas
The fathers that didn't pass, they all stacked in prisons
But that shit don't get a pass, no that shit don't get a grant
Might as well go fill a bag
Ridin' around, no tinted glass
Why I can't have tinted glass? Cause that cause suspicion
Cops flash like cinemax, don't lack ammunition
Might as well go get a gap, might as well go give it back
Don't know if they'll get it right, but I know that we'll get it last
Might as well go spend a rack at a black owned business
Had my mind on hoes, now I'm back on business, that's real
Back to what's important, I'mma build with you
Cause you're here for me and I'm here with you

[Hook]
I'm here with you
I'm here with you
I'm here with you

[Outro]
You never thought I'd make it this far, did you
You always had to make it hard for me
But I'm a motherfuckin' star, bitch didn't you know?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
Can't you hear that applause for me?
