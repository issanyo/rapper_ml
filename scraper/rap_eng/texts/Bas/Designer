In a vault that I hold you in
Open and close
Safe as thoughts that I hold you in
Open and close

Fly to Japan, saw panda like Desiigner
Fly out to London, the drugs was like designer
Fly out to France, bought some pants that was designer
Did that by design, I did that by designin'

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm a star, dodgin' bitches like they be comets
Or they be comics, or read comics
Way too often ain't no hero, let me be honest
Get a cake made, can never overstate
I'm dedicated to my pay-grade, I'm heavy goin' eighth
They play it safe it so they never be afraid
But my fears make me great, make me feel alive, levitate
Let you bear the weight of how I feel inside
Let the pain go, I choose to move freely (freely)
Let my wings grow, I'm movin' too freely (too freely)
See, this game, it'll ruin dudes easy
Platinum chain, but the ego bruise easy

[Hook]
So I fly to Japan, seen a panda like Desiigner
Fly out to London, the drugs was like designer
Fly out to France, bought some pants that was designer
Did that by design, I did that by designin'

[Chorus]
In a vault that I hold you in
Open and close
Safe as thoughts that I hold you in
Open and close
Open and close
Open and

[Bridge]
Be faithful, it's harder to stay it
I don't know how else to say it
The wonders of all the mosaics
I don't know how I could stay put

[Verse 2]
Slim chance, I gotta straight crook
Like I trace edges, let my pace tell it
I shine like the cave dwellers on their first day smellin' pine
Happy Earth Day, you heard, the world is mine
And don't it show? And nigga hate to brag but it show
I been out collectin' bags 'cause the tape a classic
Told myself I would make it happen

[Hook]
Fly to Japan, seen a panda like Desiigner
Fly out to London, the drugs was like designer
Fly out to France, bought some pants that was designer
Did that by design, I did that by designin'
