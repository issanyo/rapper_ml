[Hook]
Faded on the Henny Imma need the Champagne
Mayor of my city I don't even campaign
We never say sorry, fuck the authorities
I get stamps from customs, you get them from the club man, check your priorities

[Verse 1: Bas]
See DB hate his job, but DB half way to a DB9
I think he'll be fine
And Doubi out in Cannes every summer time hit me like "Bas, gotta come on time"
And Ash out in Dubai, and Gwelly my Nigga
I ain't seen him in a minute so he probably got a new ride
And Gunna One Hunna, and Reg gettin' fed
My Nigga 500 and my Niggas have a Q Ride
Reminiscing on the Q Ride
I'm talking about the bus
They talk about the city now they talk about us
Nas nigga, 50, I need money like Puff
Man, I be on my grind til I'm on the Mount Rush and
Ced just got bread, cop a ounce puff
Don't care Nigga next year, charge it to the budget
Fuck it, Last Winter
You got a fatty honey, I could build a tent on it
Bring ya girls too, whole clique roll it
Ride around the city no tints on it
Get money throw around like dick to these hoes
Stick to the code, you murky water
But you only like hip to the toes
I'm hip to it this how you get to it
You ready? Get to it take another hit to the heady
Wooo! Take another sip now
Nigga get a grip, get a grip nigga sprint to the Feddy

[Hook]
We never say sorry, fuck the authorities
I get stamps from customs, you get them from the club man, check your priorities

[Verse 2: Bas]
Nigga, Fuck lions, tigers and a bear too
Imma plant a money tree and to bear fruit
Ced on the beat, this is year two, bitch all of my dreams just seem so lucid
Man what is life, I don't know but I love this life
Last Winter, Four hundred nights
She a freak in them sheets all one at night
But don't tell you Niggas never see me Black Santa in Santarelli
Paris, France I be no L's
Living out of Hotels but oh well
Cause this shit so pays so well
And we run it, cause the Niggas wanna front, play dumb but they know well
Bring it back
Them bitches wanna front, play dumb bet they know well
She ain't heard from me
Last winter
She always call me on my phone sayin' "Bassy when I see you"
Told her only at my show, last winter
Last winter
She always call me on my phone sayin' "Bassy when I see you"
Told her only at my show
Last Winter
