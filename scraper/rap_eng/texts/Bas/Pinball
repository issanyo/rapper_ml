[Verse 1]
I’m looking at my receipt like "Goddamn it, that’s my receipt?"
She do it with no hands but damn it she wide receive
Super Mookin fiends, bitch, we the new elite
Locally, overseas, been so well received
This is life like, 3 strikes of felonies
3 times ahead of niggas, don’t know a better nigga
I need a sweater with some SMF lettering
A tour with 30 busses that my niggas go hammer in
And we could through all the litigation, we ain't settling
Callin' all the pots black, but we ain't kettling
Standing at the door, won’t you let us in?
Kick it down, going places we ain't never been
You tryna find a torch and we just laugh at your misfortune
Staring out the window ‘cause this life is in full motion
Make a movie out the B roll, the action keep you focused
Fuck your token of appreciate, I need payment
Nothing say thanks like a whole bunch of O’s
And some pretty little hoes when anything goes and
I’mma shoot my shot if she open
I said I’mma shoot my shot if she open

[Verse 2]
Uh, I’ve been lookin' at you all damn night
You the cookie I’ve been lookin' for my whole damn life
Bitches early, this a long ass night
Shorty bust it and suck it and all that right, yeah
She was on that white all last night
Did it off me, man she skied my pipe
That pedico make her need that diaper
Shittin' on the game, bitch I need that diaper

[Verse 3]
I’m afflicted, sick like flu though
I’m the future like Pluto
All my niggas like kudos
All my bitches got culo
You can grab it and have it
Never thirsty, I’m cool ho, she let me thrash it like Pujols
Up at bat with a 2-0, elementary mathematics
I need at least 2 hoes and give me at least 2 O’s
That’s 56 or 57, pending on your connect and how much that nigga respect it
Cause check it, to a fiend
It’s more than a gram, you understand?
Ain't enough snow in the sand, you understand?
Bitch don’t jump in the lake, it’s all sharks
My nigga, it’s money to be made, I want parts

[Verse 4]
I’m hard on hoes, call me the critic
My nigga call me up like, "Bas they all could get it"
But them bitches is beat, them hoes was hit
Damn, the weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
The weatherman never know shit
Bitch
