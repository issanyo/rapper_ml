[Intro]
Girlfriend
Want you to be
Girlfriend

[Pre-Hook: The Hics]
Reached into my mind for reflection
The truth is obscuring my perception
So take a hit on this shit feel the resin on our fingertips
And watch it billow, billow, let it go
Reached into my mind for reflection
The truth is obscuring my perception
So take a hit on this ship filled with resin on our fingertips
And watch it billow, billow, let it go

[Hook: The Hics]
Schedule that freely, you can pick a day
We can roll em up and roll em up
So I can watch everything ricochet

[Verse 1: Bas]
Six months since I last seen you
Clip blunts in them ash trays
While we speak up on them past days
You know I still have faith
It's been ten months since I last seen you
Clip blunts in them ash trays
While we speak up on them past days
You know I still have faith
You know I still have faith

[Hook: The Hics]
Schedule that freely, you can pick a day
We can roll em up and roll em up
Sit back and watch everything ricochet
Schedule that freely, you can pick a day
We can roll one up and roll one up
So I can watch everything ricochet
(Reached into my mind
Reached in, reached into, to my, to my mind
Let it, let it)

[Verse 2: Bas]
Innocence lost, it's never retained
It's never the same, it's never the same
Leave this world with some inspiration
I'll take the bait before a pure of gold
Come to grips with your intuition
Hear the whispers of your soul
Steer you down the road you're on
It's all your own
Innocence lost, it's never retained
It's never the same, it's never the same
Leave this world with some inspiration
I'll take the bait before a pure of gold
Come to grips with your intuition
Hear the whispers of your soul
Steer you down the road you're on
It's all your own
