[Verse]
Quarter water raised me
From a boy to a man
Like the shore to the sand, nigga I’m just tryna be free
I got a plan that you wouldn’t understand
Inmates to the man, now the BC’s
See this is Attica for the soul
Revolution, barricade all the doors
Let 'em know my soul ain’t for sale
And won’t be concealed in no type of cell
A cubical, the resistance different than a cuticle, shit is beautiful
When they try and break ya but they couldn’t graze ya
‘Cause you high up in the sky
Nigga, why you admiring the pie?
Come get you a slice 'fore these muhfuckas eat it all
But life ain’t cake, full of trials and tribulate
But we good ‘cause we beat 'em all
My maker hold my fate and I know we got a date
So I’m good if I don’t see tomorrow
I’m scrapin' up the plates, stuffin' life in my face
Just in case I never see tomorrow
Just in case I gotta see the morgue
Well in that case I hope I see Allah
And ask him why he had to take Amir
Man I really miss ya, it’s been too many years
I see you and your sisters, I see you and your kids
I see my aunt crying, man she spilled too many tears
But know this, fuck showbiz
If I make it anywhere, your kids already there
And boy you know we think about you every year
Every month, every week, every night in my sleep
I hope you come and visit like you do my pops
Man I just wanna kick it like we used to
Allah, please give a nigga blues clues
Why you take him? Why you spare me?
‘Cause I remember clearly
Sounds in my ears of them bullets flying near me

[Hook]
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
Nigga, no time to waste
Don’t contemplate, just fly away
Yea fly, yea fly, yea fly
All my niggas just fly, yea fly, yea fly
Let’s go
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
We ain’t promised today
Nigga, no time to waste
Don’t contemplate, just fly away
Yea fly, yea fly, yea fly
Boy fly, yea fly, yea fly

[Outro]
For the fallen soldiers
Rise in my dreams
Rise in my dreams
For the fallen soldiers
Rise in my dreams
Rise in my dreams
For the fallen soldiers
Rise in my dreams
Rise in my dreams
For the fallen soldiers
Rise in my dreams
Rise in my dreams

Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise…
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise…
