[Intro]
How did you know
This is what I always wanted
Could never have done many thing
Where you quick taking me? I might tumble
I’m trying, will somebody make you just shut up about it?
Can we settle down, baby?
No, let’s ride

[Verse]
I’m wired nigga on molly and Red Bull
Party with the fiends you know ain’t no party in civil
2 devils on my shoulders and I’m just caught in the middle
Got decisions to make, the decision’s been made
I swear these bitches screaming YOLO fore they sniff the yola
Feeling like a Porsche 4 door, used to feel like Corollas
My niggas still moving the yola, till they fill the quota
Popo on em like they just paroled
And fuck the help, they never showed em
So we outchea, get it by any means
I’m on fire; no lying, them boys remind me of anti-freeze
And my engine keep running, I’m supplying the energy
Ain’t a thing, you great a sin, I’m high on the canope
Looking out for my niggas, keep an eye on my enemies
Bitch, I’m just where I plan to be
So fuck what you say
This a new CBA, your favorite rapper’s been amnestied
Don’t pretend to be classy, ho
‘Cause I prefer nasty hoes
Test driving broads, ho I’m a car show
Pockets all stinch if I see them narcos
Prolly gonna pinch, nerf a nigga in the stick
The prison’s like the man, it shoulda gave us bar codes
Heart cold like it’s waiting to be transplanted
Band wagon feeling, guess I’m grant standing
Got them hoes on all 4’s, guess they can’t stand it
Shouts to oak shades, shouts to bandanna

[Hook]
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
I spend a condo in the club, one bottle won’t do, no
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
I spend a condo in the club, two bottles won’t do, no

[Bridge]
I check the homies and I breeze
And chickens hit my phone up, say they only wanna please
Some niggas actin phony ‘cause they only want a piece
I’ll be it, I see through, I never deceive you
Fiend

[Outro]
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
And when we hit the pound that bitch black & blue
