[Intro]
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along

[Verse 1]
Good things don't happen to good people
People never change
Pupils dilate my frame
Make my vision so exquisite
While my cousin dead and gone
I can't wait to go and visit
Father time, don't deny me
I just need a couple minutes
Exercise my better nature
I've been holding up these bridges
Nigga's always take advantage
Olive branches start to splinter
Giving way, withering, turning colder than the winter
And my city, but the center feels no pity, this for me, this for me
I'm just reaping what I sow
And I've been sewing for my nigga's in the snow
Let them know that I be sewing
Never slow to know your pain
I'll be back before you know it
Left the town a drug dealer
Came back a fucking poet
Let me grow

[Hook]
I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
Lone

[Verse 2]
Last week I bought a testing kit, I wish they made em for people
The way these nigga's be actin they should be cast in a sequel
Nigga's phony they only give you dap just to reach you
I know ain't the first homie to have to tackle these issues
Hov told me D'evils
Got the best of him then, they get the best of me now
Without a Reasonable Doubt
When nigga's acting irrational, hard to reason it out
I had to kick down the doors, I had to leave a few out
Door mat

[Hook]
I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
'Lone

[Interlude]
That's ok
My bitches know I'm a fiend
But that's ok
They just love me for me
They just love me for me
(methylone)

[Hook]
I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
'Lone
I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
'Lone
