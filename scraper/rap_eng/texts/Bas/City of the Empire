[Intro]
Just another story in the game
But every story ain't the same
But if you change can you change back
It's a shame that I came back

[Verse 1]
But my niggas wouldn't let me hold no weight
They said Bas you gonna make it get us out this fuckin' place
Anywhere we wanna take it Tokyo, Makow
Make hoes make french toast, and bow
Dinner at Del Frisco's
Houses in every zip code
I'm headin' out to Cali nigga you should see my rent though
I'm fuckin' with the vibes this shit a different tempo
I never need a mink coat we makin' strides
But I swear this shit is never simple
I'm trying to keep my lady
She never had a baby
I know she got the kid though
I sent more and pondered how to do that
Cause I ain't too good at love but I know how to do raps
Write it like MJ playing the 23
Wiser my age I've been graying since 23
Everyday it's like 20 beats I feast
Cause everything on my plate the fiends they just relate
We ain't even there but bitch look what we made
New York, New York, my city that is my state
My niggas going to court for ballin' love of the sport
Supply and demand, let's call it love of the snort
Let's call it love of the snort and all of the sort
It push me harder and farther
My father pushin' 70 don't want him dying a martyr for me
For his guidance I'll be grinding till he's off of his feet
I pray it all come from me
This shit is all for the fam the rest is all for the team, fiends
Never once slide type clique
Never untie hit the ground like a bus ride
Shake the town like a mudslide

[Hook]
City of the Empire
City of the Empire
City of the Empire

[Outro]
Queens shit, fiend shit
Queen bitch roll blunts seamstress
G shit, allegiance
To my real bitches and my real G's salute thee
It's Bas
