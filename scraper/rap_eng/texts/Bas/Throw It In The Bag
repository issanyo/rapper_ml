[Chorus]
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Humping on my leg, yo, mind my fucking glass
Makin' money last, hide it in a flask
Sound of a bomb drops, throw it in the bag
Make your money last, hide it in the back
Sound of a bomb blast, throw it in tha bag
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Know who I am, I run this fuckin' club
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Humping on my leg, yo, mind my fucking glass
Makin' money last, hide it in a flask
Sound of a bomb drops, throw it in the bag
Make your money last, hide it in the back
Sound of a bomb blast, throw it in tha bag
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Know who I am, I run this fuckin' club

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Whip, whip, whippin' up a lick
Whip, whip, whippin' up a whip
Bitch I been a problem (problem), bitch I been a pilot
Talkin' microfiber, Medusa on my body
Garage like a dealer, '02 Reggie Miller
They come in to squash it, we come in to kill it (hah)
She bust it wide open then she popped a pill (hah)
Make that roof disappear, David Copperfield
Sippin' on that Henn, I be sippin' on that 'Roc
I be stuntin' on them M's, I came straight off that block
And I pull up in that Mulsanne, all red like I'm Luo' Deng
All my jewelry blu-ray, fuck boy it's a new day (hah)

[Chorus]
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Humping on my leg, yo, mind my fucking glass
Makin' money last, hide it in a flask
Sound of a bomb drops, throw it in the bag
Make your money last, hide it in the back
Sound of a bomb blast, throw it in tha bag
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Know who I am, I run this fuckin' club

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Uh, that game of rap don't play with (play with)
Came up, I Rose like Jalen
100 deep how we came in (what)
Throwin' signs like we Masons
Ho this here ain't no haven
Coke boy, yes I'm their favorite (that's right)
Snatch the gravel under your feet, I'm removing the pavement
Headshot that 'rari, brainless
Same crib Saddam Hussein lives
Blood diamonds all in my bracelet
Fuck you and them hoes you came with (bow)
Snatch your fish out the water
Candid camera record her
Yellow gold for my haters
Purple drink we the Lakers
Know we keep it twizzy on the scale in
Smell the weed nigga like Sebastian I could tell fear
Fresh once it's Bel-Air
Look what I smell here
Pussy on these niggas, nope that's your bitch she just live here
{Coke Boy, baby}

[Chorus]
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Humping on my leg, yo, mind my fucking glass
Makin' money last, hide it in a flask
Sound of a bomb drops, throw it in the bag
Make your money last, hide it in the back
Sound of a bomb blast, throw it in tha bag
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Know who I am, I run this fuckin' club

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Gotta keep it a hunnid, K.O.D.'s spendin' hunnid
Willy on them hoes, tell 'em give me head with a helmet
Money all I hear, bitches all in my ear
Can't you see I'm high? California
Honey on them hoes, kidnap your bitch
You put black sand in her toes, black Marilyn Monroe, nigga
Catch you playin' no hoes, probably playin' to that role
Cocaine Kurt Cobain, shorty playin' with her nose
Fast life I chose, fast cars we drove
Bad hoes, bad fros, face down they go
Tip-toin' that money, I stack six floors of them hundreds
I got six stories of that money, coke boys we run it, Montana

[Chorus]
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Humping on my leg, yo, mind my fucking glass
Makin' money last, hide it in a flask
Sound of a bomb drops, throw it in the bag
Make your money last, hide it in the back
Sound of a bomb blast, throw it in tha bag
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Know who I am, I run this fuckin' club

[Break: French Montana]
Tell them hoes I'll holler, stacks I got
Fuck you pay me, that's my motto
Tell them hoes I'll holler, stacks I got
Fuck you pay me, that's my motto

[Chorus]
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Humping on my leg, yo, mind my fucking glass
Makin' money last, hide it in a flask
Sound of a bomb drops, throw it in the bag
Make your money last, hide it in the back
Sound of a bomb blast, throw it in tha bag
Bass lines and cars anything fast
Know who I am, I run this fuckin' club
