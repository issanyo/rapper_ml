[Verse 1]
2 white girls and they both Beckys
Got me livin' like the nigga on the Dos Equis
I was born ready my first home was Paris
Now I roam New York where the chrome is heavy
Get too hyper boy that shit will have you quick
Have you walkin' round your crib with bags of shit some nasty shit
If you take the tumble come back up that happen quick
Got me jumpin' out the booth like did that just happen quick
Met her at my show damn that just happened quick
Arrogant nigga fuck it I could probably build a pyramid
Bearded like the Pharaoh but I'm Nubian truly him
This ain't no shallow pool boo I hope you swim, shit
What's your problem with me don't know how to relate
I'm just findin' my way so get out of my way
Last Winter hot bitches and cold brews
Old flings but oh well, they old news

[Hook]
Here I am rollin' up another bud
God damn, higher than a muthafuck
Let me take you to the places you fiendin' to go
Cause niggas talk about it but I seen it before!!, yeah!!
I seen it before!!, yeah!!
I seen it before

[Verse 2]
I see through you niggas
I got laser eyes
Don't you patronize
That shit don't get me
I am not your dawg
Nigga don't pet me
Screamin' fuck the law cause they won't let me
Let me be just let me be free
Smokin's Os with the fiends no sesame seeds
Got scholars, parolees whatever between
They fuckin' with me they fuck with the fiends
Super Mookin' mutt I blow an O a day
These bitches latch on like a stowaway
She get on my last nerve I tell her go away
I fuck her once that bitch is a throw away

[Bridge]
Mook a half a P
I need to mook, a half a P
I'm 'bout to mook, a half a P
I really think so
Mook a half a P
I need to mook, a half a P
I'm 'bout to mook, a half a P
I really think so

[Hook]
Here I am rollin' up another bud
God damn higher than a muthafuck
Let me take you to the places you fiendin' to go
Cause niggas talk about it but I seen it before!!, yeah!!
I seen it before!!, yeah!!
I seen it before

[Intermission]

[Outro]
2 white girls and they both Beckys
Got me livin' like the nigga on the Dos Equis
Got me livin' like the nigga on the Dos Equis
