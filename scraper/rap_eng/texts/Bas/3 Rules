[Intro]
It's Bas, It's Bas
Super Mooking Fiends, Super Mooking Fiends

[Verse 1]
Hello, I'm back again
Money under mattresses
Flying over atlases
First-class, so to see
Turned into some mattresses
All my niggas down
When my niggas in the deficit, blowing out the pound
Cause my niggas depressed and shit
Money is the issue, Ha
Right up of the press and hit every corner
Hopping out her dress, and I barely know her
Maybe Mama didn't show her, Papa wouldn't hold her
I show her shit she's never seen, I'm the wick
Dip inside her kerosene, You ain't special, must be on that Ketamine
On my level, bitch I'm so serene, sureal
Mooking with the Fiends, oh foreal

[Chorus]
3 Rules that I follow
