[Dialogue: Gloria Clemente & Billy Hoyle]
"How much do you love me?"
"I love you infinity."
"That's not enough."
"Infinity is the biggest number there is."
"No it's not."
"You tell me one bigger."
"Infinity plus two."
"Ha, I love you infinity plus two."
"Oh Billy you so stupid! You should've said I love you infinity plus infinity!"
