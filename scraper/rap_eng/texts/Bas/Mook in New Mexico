[Intro]
Fuck a penny for your thoughts, nigga, anyhow
I just called my nigga Ron, he brought the Henny out
Got them things in the Kool-Aid in this motherfucker
Like a gang of Gorillas in this motherfucker

[Hook]
That's a closed book, when she with me got your bitch open
And she don't get mook, when she with me got your bitch smokin'
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
That's a closed book, when she with me got your bitch open
And she don't get mook, when she with me got your bitch smokin'
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert

[Verse 1]
No tats but my passport got plenty
I board flights and I ask, "Do you got Henny?"
And she say, "Courvoisier"
I say, "Fuck it, I would like plenty"
How many these nights do I got in me
Couldn't really tell, blind every day, the same time
Picture every face drawn on got on a for sale sign
Me? I gotta stay sharp, can't afford a stale mind
See? I'm 'bout my bread, motherfucker
And I can't afford a stale mind
My city grimy, that Rollie shiny, well, you can't afford to tell time
And they gotta take squats on the jail time
Cause nobody got guap for the bail bonds
And they had to get street cause college ain't cheap and
Mama gon' eat, if we gotta pop heat so be it
Puttin' in work, Soviet, and that shit work, you see it
Put your latest work in a hearse and I send it to the dirt
Lil nigga, that's where your CD is, CC 'em
Ah, put 'em on alert, me? I make art cause it's from the heart
Love me 'til I'm gone, when I die you gon' have to hit a fuckin' museum to see it, Bas

[Hook]
That's a closed book, when she with me got your bitch open
And she don't get mook, when she with me got your bitch smokin'
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you know the models on the coupe
But you don't even know what's in your food
Nigga, Google it, be alert, be alert
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
Put your young ass in debt
Now they got hands on your handsome check
You in check, nigga, be alert
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
She catchin' VD's and passin' 'em off like TD's and you knee deep
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
Yeah, whole country at war
And you don't even know what for cause we only want more
Be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert, be alert
