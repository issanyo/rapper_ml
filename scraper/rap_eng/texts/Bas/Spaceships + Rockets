[Verse 1: Bas]
Iconic, I got it, all the way facts (it’s all the way)
Blue tonic, James Harden, hit 'em with the step back (tell the bitch step back)
Ironic, take a mixer, bring a heart away back, it was harder way back
Niggas harbor hate, hatin' niggas hard to hate back
New bitch, new flows, nigga, automate that
All the way black like Sudan in the summer
Hundred bands in the belt, I ain’t dancing for nothing
I got hands on the button, nigga push me
Laying in the lands of my ancestry
Got the sand in my hair and the beach next to me
Nigga, please step to me
Have to son these niggas, have to run these niggas
Had to cut some off like a vasectomy
When the beat get to me make it reset
​mOma+Guy, met this shawty at your party
She was almost like purified water, rurified air
I could die in her arms and be mummified there
Verified facts what I speak then, you should peep them
Certified packs when I chief them

[Pre-Chorus: Moe Moks & Jillian Hervey]
We lit, we lit
We lit, we lit (yeah)
We lit, we lit
We lit, we lit (yeah)

[Chorus: Jillian Hervey]
All these spaceships and rockets (ahhh)
Got me feelin' high (ahhh)
On my spaceship I'm rockin' (ahhh)
Fall into the sky (ahhh)

[Verse 2: Jillian Hervey & Moe Moks]
We lit, we lit (ahhh)
Fly high like I'm NASA (ahhh)
Move my hips like a salsa (ahhh)
I'm like butter on a lobster (ahhh)
We lit, we lit (ahhh)
Got me singin' like I'm Chaka (ahhh)
Moonwalking in mi casa (ahhh)
Young queen Cleopatra (ahhh)

[Pre-Chorus: Moe Moks & Jillian Hervey]
We lit, we lit
We lit, we lit (yeah)
We lit, we lit
We lit, we lit (yeah)

[Verse 3: Moe Moks & Jillian Hervey]
We lit, we lit
Can't go with my rasta
Merengue with the lobster
We eatin fishes with the pasta
We lit, we lit (ahhh)
Been feelin' like a popstar (ahhh)
Having dreams I'm a rockstar (rockstar, rockstar, ahhh)
The young king with the rap star (ahhh)

[Pre-Chorus: Moe Moks & Jillian Hervey]
We lit, we lit (yeeaaaah)
We lit, we lit (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We lit, we lit
We lit, we lit (yeah)

[Chorus: Jillian Hervey]
All these spaceships and rockets (ahhh)
Got me feelin' high (ahhh)
On my spaceship I'm rockin' (ahhh)
Fall into the sky (ahhh)
