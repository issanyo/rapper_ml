[Intro]
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted, blasted
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(can you dig)

[Break]
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(Mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm so mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)

[Verse 1: Bas]
Pass it, pass it, now I'm blasted
Ash it, ash it stupid bastard
My eyes lower than a casket
My piff greener than the Packers
Or the J.E.T.S
My chicks meaner then the ratchet
Bet my [?] seedless
My hydro, I call it drastic
That's that shit, have a nigga on a trip
Get a grip, counter grip
Grab a bitch, pound a bitch
Hittin' licks, pounds of piff
I don't ever feel these rapper I can tell they counterfeit
Hop up on the mountain pits

[Hook: 66 Holds]
And them hoes they know
The Feinds is mooking by the O's
Burn and stick it, light the flame
Super mook, glad you came

[Break]
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(Mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm so mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)

[Verse 2: Bas]
Mooking haze everyday, face
Slid up on a base, safe
Sorry copper, I don't take the bait, snake
I just move the weight, cake
While I'm out of state, I go on a date
Then I will penetrate, I don't make mistakes
Feel I'm 'bout to break, I let her decide my fate
She treat me like a shake weight, wait
Count money burn celebratory blunts
Gotta get it cause you only gonna live it once
Tryna own it, I ain't fuckin' with the rented ones
Jamaica Queens, but I take it where it's really from
The sentence of the kush, ascended from the kush
All you mook hoes, do a bear shit in the woods

[Hook: 66 Holds]
And them hoes they know
The Feinds is mooking by the O's
Burn and stick it, light the flame
Super mook, glad you came, hoes

[Break]
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(Mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm so mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)
That's it, that's it, now I'm blasted
(I'm super mook)

[Verse 3: Bas]
They wanna cage you in a wood box
Tell you money make the world stop
I wish the motherfuckers would stop
I wish I coulda went to Woodstock
Whole clique piff flame
Make a 4-6 nigga feel 16
Make a broke nigga feel like a rich man
Like a rich man, like a rich man
They wanna cage you in a wood box
Tell you money make the world stop
I wish the motherfuckers would stop
I wish I coulda went to Woodstock
Whole clique piff flame
Make a 4-6 nigga feel 16
Make a broke nigga feel like a rich man
Like a rich man, like a rich man
I'm super mook

[Hook: 66 Holds]
And them hoes they know
The Feinds is mooking by the O's
Burn and stick it, light the flame
Super mook, glad you came

[Outro]
