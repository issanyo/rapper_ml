[Intro: Mack Wilds and Bas]
You say you want me to have the world (You sure?)
You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?)

[Verse 1: Bas]
If Ogee got them bangers than I go forever with flows
On a blank canvas Bas so incredibly dope
Giving light to my dreams, I couldn't measure the scope
Turn that white into green, that's Incredible Hulk
Man I'm so fly I see the heavens approaching
The Pearl in them Gates, I'm burning a stogie, than pearling a jay
My memory fades, that's cool cause every day is a memory made
The Judge a crook he throw the book at every case
So we celebrate life, that's for every occasion
I ran out of patience, I can't be complacent
When niggas a take a limb and leave you with casings
My car, it barely start it need a new AC
My star ripped out my heart and told me replace it
My job it never call, I need me some wages
And you, well you, you just need me to make it
(Ohhhh) You just need me to make it
I get it I get it I get it, you just need me to make it

[Chorus: Mack Wilds and Bas]
You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?)
You say you want me to have the world
I get it I get it I get  it

[Verse 2: Bas]
Hit it in the mornin' or the evenin' if that pussy good
I'm probably never leaving love, do you still believe in love?
No it ain't real, Damn not even us
She been down so long she gotta even up
Nevermind my intentions, of Rari's and mentions
You see them hoes like it, and now you get defensive
You prying in my mentions, and I can feel the tension
You'd rather me a real job, suit ay'?, a pension
You feel I be a new guy as soon as it sets in
I feel I'm losing you bout' every second
Don't you get apprehensive, we served a sentence together, I know you down forever
Aware of what I got, I couldn't replace it
You want me for me, see the glory and base it
I love you for it, cause you can't even fake it
A heart on the fringe, you don't want me to make it
You don't want me to make it

[Chorus: Mack Wilds and Bas]
You say you want me to have the world (You sure?)
You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?)
No she frontin'
You say you want me to have the world
Nah she frontin', Ohh your frontin'
You say you want me to have the world (Are you sure?)

[Outro: Mack Wilds]
It's you world (x20)
