Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse: Doctur Dot]
You not seein' me nigga
Maybe, on Easter and Christmas
Lately, you reap what you sow from the seed that you spittin'
[?] you can't keep my attention
Ion wanna waste no more of my patience
Playin' those same ole' games
[?]
Only sleep on a plane
Every night 'fore [?]

[: Bas]
