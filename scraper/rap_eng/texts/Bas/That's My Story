[Verse 1: Bas]
I had a 5 year plan
But in 24 months, bitch I got it all done
24 blunts of the skunk, toast the glass to winners
Drinking 'til I vomit scallops, I guess that was dinner
I’m blown, got my shades on
But it’s funny right, ‘cause this life
Never been this bright
Don’t be foolish, boy, it’s always more to it
Stuck between a rock and a boiling pot
Lead a whole block, leading all for doctors
What you on? I’mma put us on
I ain't talkin' pebbles when I tell em that I'm stoned
Oh so fade, bitch I’m oh so faded
Shine like my life, gold plated
Hungry like it’s Budapest, Shawty who da best?
Roll the mook, let me do the rest, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
Ride around on volks, holler at my folks
Got a lot of smoke, pockets on halitos'
Stinky green, stinky green, let me set the scene
Flee the scene and my weapon clean, fiend

[Hook]
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it

[Verse 2: Bas]
This ain’t Amsterdam, but we go Dutch
Trick, you could pay for your own lunch
You clearly have the wrong one
I mean you clearly must be on one, un uh
You wanna see me? lately see me when it’s all done
Sorry hun, it was all fun, um
Living out my dreams, I don’t need to sleep
Going offroad, I don’t need a Jeep
I’m a leader, sky beaming, I seen it, had a vision
Purple drapes, high ceilings, purple haze, high ceilings
I just keep on getting better, I amaze high ceilings
I Never cap like the snapple fact, matter fact
Make em double back, every fuckin' track – cat attack
Here kitty, catacomb, dead to me
Breakfast in bed, honeycombs and some head for me
Put me in a song, what she said to me
Well alright

[Pre-Hook]
Ride around on volks, holler at my folks
Got a lot of smoke, pockets on halitos'
Stinky green, sticky green, let me set the scene
Flee the scene and my weapon clean, fiend

[Hook]
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
