[Intro]
I guess the lights that been shining a lot brighter
Let's have a drink with the girls from the videos

[Verse 1]
If I wasn't preoccupied, self-absorbed, yourself alone
I left you with, I got the world
Still felt alone and ever since been lost in the stars
Missing on what Heaven sent godly
I'm faulty, I'm fraud maybe
Probably was the reason that your dog hate me
But fuck that bitch like the law baby
Girl, I'm just playing but I'm off though
We should grab a drink before we link up at the crossroad
Pick it all apart
"Don't be tickling my heart," you'd say
"I was with you from the start," you'd say
"I really thought you did it for the art," you'd say
I guess the lights that been shining a lot brighter
Let's have a drink with the girls from the videos
I must have been through this one 'til my past life
I see the pitfalls, dodging the difficult

[Hook: Bas + The Hics]
Rolling down the slippery slope, stay on point I tippy toe it
Won't you smile it gives me hope
Pray that you forgive me for it
Rolling down the slippery slope, stay on point I tippy toe it
Won't you smile it gives me hope
Pray that you forgive me for it

[Verse 2]
You understand?
Can't remember last night a nigga under Xans
My haters I lost sight can't see 'em under Bans
My niggas yell, "let's ride" they see I got a plan
Me I understand, I just understand it
I pray to God when I see how far we've come
Tears of joy I think we could drown the sun
And let that marijuana twist up
Put me right up in the lineup never been sub
I'm next up never mind when we get snubbed
They getting Michael Jordan, Harold Miner mixed up
We gone show 'em that Dreamville this year
We gone show 'em that when the people come together ain't no holding back
And that's the only fact
I been holding back tears for these young black souls lost in the past year
Some by the law, they ain't even flash steel
Some by they own dogs, most by their own fears
And you can watch it all young nigga stand still
Niggas yelling 100, they ain't half real
Fuck a line in the sand, I put a line on the dot and leave you right where you stand, and I'm just trying to understand

[Hook: Bas + The Hics]
Rolling down the slippery slope, stay on point I tippy toe it
Won't you smile it gives me hope
Pray that you forgive me for it
Rolling down the slippery slope, stay on point I tippy toe it
Won't you smile it gives me hope
Pray that you forgive me for it

[Outro: The Hics]
Been there before, lust in my eye
Times in the past
Drowning my sorrows, my fears speaking louder
In my head getting louder
I'm holding on tight darling
The roots to places I found
I'm closing my eyes closed
Now, I'm back with you in my mind
