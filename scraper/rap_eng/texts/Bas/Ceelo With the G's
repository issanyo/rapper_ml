[Verse 1]
Ceelo with the G's
Put the paper down, rake the leaves
Piece of little weed
Nigga break it down, pick the seeds
Fiend, roll a swisher please
No promethazine, got amphetamines
Got me on a devil lean
Sahara to the Gobi niggas know me to be hot as water
Say, "Trust me, he flows"
Not livin' for tomorrow, got no time to borrow
Bitch, I rep my borough
Yeah, trust me Queens know
Fuck a knight in shining armor, play for team No Daughters
What this game has done taught us is "Trust me, she blows"
Stop makin' demands, bitch stay in your pocket
She eyein' my grands, bitch stay out my pocket
She eyein' my man, go ahead bitch rock it
We get it and split it, I never could knock it
I look at the bar and I bet I could top it

[Hook 2x]
Hundred racks just to drive off a lot, though
Scenic route just to dodge all the potholes
20 racks at retail, isn't it?
Cause the devil's in the details, isn't it?

[Verse 2]
Ceelo with the G's
Put the paper down, rake the leaves
Here's a lil' weed
Nigga break it down, pick the seeds
Fiend, roll a swisher please
Cause the mook it give me epiphany
When hoes try to play me like tympani
Like Mighty Kong, show me finer homes
And designer stones, I want Tiffany's
Told her find a clone, I know I'm kind of stoned
No trick bitch, you can't get wit' me
Cause I found my zone
Had to put on a form, a good fit for me
I seldom see myself in dreams
I live this shit, no issues wit' my self-esteem
Tunnel vision, hear every station
Yo television, I failed to mention
Frail attention in school, dog
Failed attention, that rude boy
Fire lit by my crew boy
To acquire shit that I'm due boy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fall back or pass through
Matter fact, that nigga that gassed you was ass too
Son, we gon' last like tattoos
Ho nigga get a glass shoe, why?
You can try it, but you can't high tie it
That shit weak and you can't fight fire
I've been wired for days, out in London town
I just lock shit down but I ain't got priors
Feelin' like the best, nigga ain't that biased?
Fuck, try it straight to the head but I ain't Lem Bias
From the ground up, to them telephone wires
I hold down my city since Boys on Da Block
They gave me the key, I done blown all the locks
Called a committee, Queens in this bitch
I hit all the spots, I brought all them with me
Never been petty, don't got the time to be harboring envy
I'm Fendi with mine
Gucci, bitch I got the plug, I got whatever you need, but I ain't got no love
Got something to say? I don't hear it, I can't understand
Your chatter don't make it across the Atlantic and I'm out in Europe
I'm wit' all my niggas, I never take this shit for granted
The cards have been handed, deuces is wild
Deuces is power, deuces like two hundred twenty two thou
Deuces for love, Cut it though deuces I'm out

I'm out
I'm out
