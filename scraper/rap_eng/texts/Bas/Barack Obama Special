[Interlude]
Y'all hear the voice, y'all see the name, nigga
Biggie, it's Queens
Y'all know everything Barack Obama Special over here
He lets it fly

[Intro]
Juice
This one is dedicated to
My bitch ass neighbors, ha, ha, yeah
'Cause I'm livin' better now, better now
Bitch I'm livin' better now
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I had to move 'cause neighbors so racist
My new crib fly though (sheesh)
Lookin' like the 4th of July though (fiends)
Lookin' like a frosted Gelato
Cool as a chill, Navy Seal nigga (pff, pff)
Hot as the heels on a field nigga
Puttin' in work, fuck how you feel
Buy my family trips, fuck value meals
Only lie to police, I ain't tyin' your leash
I got higher motives, fuck lyin' still, I am on a whole 'nother level
Got up out the street, ran up in the industry
Just to see, that I'm dealin' with a whole 'nother devil
Whatever last, smoke buddah, make more Gouda cheese
My whip European but the kid Sudanese
Got a laundry list of niggas with the list of they needs, holy
Them cats is prone to actin' phony
Get no actions ask the homies, you ain't know?
We miles ahead, the matrimony's dead
No time for fakes, my niggas make mistakes
Heard it all, the commentary's dead
They go to state, don't get no GPAs
Got GTAs, the commissary's fed
I pray to God, I call in my request
I tell Him my regrets
I tell nobody else how it feels, I cannot share the stress I'm feeling

[Chorus]
I tell em my regrets
(Tell me things and old desires)
I tell nobody else how it feels
I cannot share the stress I'm feeling

[Verse 2]
I can tell you're apprehensive and I can't ask why
I'm like fireworks in the Baghdad sky
I might be the second coming, I might be the end all
But I keep her comin', especially off the Henn' dog
In the end all rivers, lakes will dry out, but us involved we gon' leave a ocean of salt, Lord
So many love's lost, let me count it with the gloves off
I need more fingers, Cole lingers long in my soul
Got my eyes down but I can't find ground
Ten toes holdin' the floor, like I'm tied down but I can't find ground
We the same, thought you came from the roots too
So love ain't love like it used to be
You abstain from the blame if you chose to
But I'ma be here some years so get used to me

[Chorus]
Tell me things and old desires
I tell nobody else how it feels
I cannot share the stress I'm feeling

[Verse 3]
'Cause for his new recital he go suicidal
Not me, blue recital, hit the main stage, I'm the coolest I know
How I maintain empty bottles in the silver buckets, say it's luck
Come and spend the day with us
I've been up the past 48, first 48 going great
Forty states in forty in days, got them motherfuckas goin' crazy
When all they waitin' on is me and I been waiting long to see it
Bassy

[Outro]
When you milk, you milk, you can't deny the milk
The only way to go is the milky way, my boy
