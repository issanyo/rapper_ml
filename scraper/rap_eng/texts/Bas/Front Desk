[Intro]
Riding 'round the town ducking my old bitches, old

[Verse 1]
Riding 'round the town ducking my old bitches
You ain't hold me down 'til a nigga came up
Why you want me now? What's the focus? Wait, I know
You was pressing dial and my name came up (right)

[Bridge]
I've been off it and I've been gone for weeks, still smell the set up
Put her on repeat, can't put no pussy on a pedestal
I be home all week, so for a week she in stilettos
Call me when you need, only when you- ooh
I've been off it and I've been gone for weeks, still smell the set up
Put her on repeat, can't put no pussy on a pedestal
I be home all week, so for a week she in stilettos
Call me when you need, only when you-

[Chorus]
Oh you heading out of town with your bestfriend
I ain't front desk bitch you ain't gotta check in, hey (yeah, yeah)
What do you call that?
I knew you'd come back (come back)
I knew you'd come back (back)
I knew you'd come back, back
What do you call that?
I knew you'd come back (come back)
I knew you'd come back (back)
I knew you'd come back

[Verse 2]
I'm going OT for the week
Double OT for the weekend
Got me a freak and she geeking
She talk a lot when she peaking
Speaking 'bout life, drama and her current affairs, letâ€˜s bury it there
I got enough problems, got no worries or care, spare you an ear
And she think that's me on the internet
She don't know me that's the internet
She just get high off my intellect
I just get high tell her "give me neck"
My mind on this check (you know what I'm saying)
My mind on this check (just know I ain't playing)
My mind on this check (this money of mine)
My mind on this check (that's all on my mind)

[Chorus]
Oh you heading out of town with your bestfriend
I ain't front desk bitch you ain't gotta check in, hey (yeah, yeah)
What do you call that?
I knew you'd come back (come back)
I knew you'd come back (back)
I knew you'd come back, back
What do you call that?
I knew you'd come back (come back)
I knew you'd come back (back)
I knew you'd come back

[Outro]
Lust persists, why pretend?
I can't tell no lie, bitch I'm too poppin' now
Empty bottles, empty promises
I can't tell no lie, bitch I'm too poppin' now
