[Verse]
Fuck you Quick, Quick!
Get it regardless
Fucking the game, I hit it the hardest
It won't be the same I give you my word
I never do promises unless I deliver
Life's a bitch but ain't no living unless I forgive her
That's bottles after bottles all this stress on my liver
I don't ever watch the news
They don't ever do no articles about the stress on my niggas
We the best in the business, I'm their Captain-Lieutenant
Cole he caught a jet and rolled
He just point ahead to roll, niggas slept for a minute
Now its over for these hoes claimed the city for my own
Listen when the story told they gone tear, they gone cheer
They gone say the homies home yeah Queens, they gone say the burrows on
Bas

[Outro]
Shit
I'm happy as fuck nigga!
This my last winter
Two Week Notice
Fuck it, I'm not one with speeches nigga
That's it
