[Intro]
Said I'm calling all my niggas with me riding
Dressing room like we keep bitches on the rider
Bus full of white girls singing Akinyele
Momma I think I just met me a Madonna
Everything glowing ain't a diamond
I know everything glowing ain't a diamond
Girl you shining

[Hook]
But I ain't felt love in a long time, and I  told you that when we woke up
I guess that might have been the wrong time
My best pick up line is young nigga with  money, I ain't playing
My best pick up line is young nigga with money

[Verse 1]
Killing these niggas, I got a feeling these niggas is out to get me but trust me I got 'em
Straight out the borough my city love me we thorough
My nigga you don't want none of them problems
She acting crazy she calling me baby I just be feeding them bitches the bottles
She live in way up in Harlem but she come to me when I call her
And she all about her fashion she be working for Vogue
Me I'm all about my stacking I be working the road

[Bridge]
But them clouds never get old
Them clouds never get old

[Verse 2]
So focused on, make the dopest song
Got this chick open armed, got her lit on patron
Got her ticked off, cause I got no tick for her
I got no time, but I got some dick for her now
She was lit, I was milk
Girl don't let that milk spoil
You got some friends that stress you
He ain't loyal, I got some friends, don't let 'em think for you now
Pull up the whip for you now, here go the town
I am no pimp, but I am a player
You not with the shits? I'll talk to you later
I'm playing girl I got a thing for you now

[Hook]
But I ain't felt love in a long time, and I told you that when we woke up
I guess that might have been the wrong time
My best pick up line is young nigga with  money, I ain't playing
My best pick up line is young nigga with money

[Bridge]
718 to your state, 212 to your city
My best pick up line is young nigga with  money, I ain't playing
718 to your state, 212 to your city

[Verse 3]
Throwing fishing nets in the ocean to cash
Good catch, here's to hoping it last, nigga
And bring them hoes back to the pad from the show
But only if they know how to act, nigga
Don't ever get stuck on your laurels like
All of them stuck in the past niggas
Shit, it's how I got past niggas
For real

[Outro]
Said I'm calling all my niggas with me riding
Dressing room like we keep bitches on the rider
Bus full of white girls singing Akinyele
Momma I think I just met me a Madonna
