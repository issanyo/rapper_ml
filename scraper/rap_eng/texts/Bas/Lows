Ironic - I was just looking for a lighter but I found you
Now let’s go and fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)
Let’s go and fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)
Let’s go and fuck the night up
Ironic - I was just looking for a lighter but I found you
Now let’s go and fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)
Let’s go and fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)
Let’s go and fuck the night up

[Verse]
Ain’t no bruise if you sticking moves
As far as I see it, I mean it
Calm a spade a spader, a dog a dog shit, yea ho I be it
Uh, I got green on my mind
A fiend, I need to get mine
She say your dough my glow a little greener than mine
But your soul ain't cleaner than mine
If you looking for a diamond, gotta find it
Go deep in the mines
And my game fucked with a bitch brain
I can go so deep in her mind
Couldn’t keep her, I’m fine, nothing lasts forever
My whole life patched together
And life ain’t a fucking joke
But we smoke, fuck and still laugh together
I said cool it girl, you know life is short
Uh, or whatever
You say you wrong boy, see mind in a long war, since forever

[Hook]
Ironic - I was just looking for a lighter but I found you
Now let’s go and fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)
Let’s go and fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)
Let’s go and fuck the night up
Ironic - I was just looking for a lighter but I found you
Now let’s go and fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)
Let’s go and fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)
Let’s go and fuck the night up
Ironic - I was just looking for a lighter but I found you
Now let’s go and fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)
Let’s go and fuck the night up (the night up, the night up)
Let’s go and fuck the night up

[Outro]

Yo, what exit is this?
We probably gotta take it to the last stop
Yeah?
I don't know, I just made that up. But I always figured, like, Amsterdam, last stop. Cause it says that on shit
That last train we were on was going straight to Belgium
I mean, look, ask somebody I guess
That waffle we had earlier was [?]. Shit was good as hell
How far is Amsterdam, do you know?
It's about 55 minutes
55 minutes from here? Alright, thank you
