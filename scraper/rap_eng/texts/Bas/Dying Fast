[Hook: Angel McCluskey]
Keep you close to my heart
Save up the moment,  a moment

[Verse 1]
Since my niggas facin probation we gon smoke they faces off
Wish that we can smoke and smoke until we burn them cases off
I’m not too proud about, not much to smile about
It’s like they never took them fuckin braces off
Gunshots… but ain’t no fuckin races start
Either play your part and play it apart or play it raw, hole in 1
Few hunned yards, you a superstar groupies heart
But yo lady got the truest heart
I’m on the verge of greatness, patience is the only virtue
But for the moment I’ll be… overindulging, I see
Gracious faces, greener passes, gold chains, purple fumes
Couple niggas still breathing but to me R.I.P
I give niggas a shovel, tell em “get to digging, you ain’t finished?
Til that hole is big enough for you to fit in”
I don’t need credit, I don’t need a fuckin credit limit
Me and my team travel like we never learn to pivot
And spend it in cities where bitches numbers be like 21 digits
How I’m supposed to dial that when I’m high as that, hah?
How was such a chilly breeze flowin from yo eye and flash
I thought fire breed new life but niggas is dying… fast

[Hook: Bas]
I’m on a pill, think I love this bitch – that’s how real it feel
Sniffin out a Benjamin, that’s the cleanest bill
Poisons infiltrate my regiment and even still
I ain’t numb and under this I could feel it still
