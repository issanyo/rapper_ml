[Intro]
Girl get your head right, you best get your head right
You make sure my home good, I make sure your neck bright
You text me you wanna be next to me
I book you the ticket right next to me
Girl, you could pick up this check with (flex)

[Hook: Correy C]
This for all time, you can't blame the summer, girl
Get your head right
This for all the time, you can't blame the summer, girl

[Verse: Bas]
All my niggas high as hell and blunted
Bought my bitch the YSL she wanted
Nigga, Mom Dukes wanna trip to Dubai
I'ma get her everything she wanted
I'ma do this shit the way I wanna
Cube hard to them California days
Remember hoes I had to motivate, now they see Sun, like the water breakin'
They get to count my dough but you got your own, you the star of the show
We do it big, goin' hard on the road, but you got my heart on a rope
You invaded my conscience, I'm a dog, but not much of a bark
You smart, you takin' precautions, shit, I knew from the start

[Hook: Correy C]
This for all time, you can't blame the summer, girl
Get your head right
This for all the time, you can't blame the summer, girl
Get your head right
Oh, girl, you gotta get your head right (girl)
Oh, girl, you gotta get your head right
