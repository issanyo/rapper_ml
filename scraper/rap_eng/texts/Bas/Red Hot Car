Needs Transcribing - Song here!

[Verse 1]
I'm the maestro, you up in the stands
You should clap your hands when I orchestrate
Running ice so put it in my hands
I'll take you to the land that the coaches pray for
Dreamville, my team so ill that all make heat and we all get paid for it
Rock stages and back stage it was your dream girl she gone wait for us
Two years ago Cole told me bro you gonna blow, just wait for it
So I hone my craft, wasn't a forward of cash
Put my heart of wax I was made for it
Then I wrote a track and he fucked with that
And we shot a vid and he paid for it
It's that organic me and rappers, me and them not the same story
I traveled the atlas before I was rapping
The king was what my parents raised for
Lost in the traffic but my city [?]
Started trap just to pay for it
A pair of new kicks, hoes stay at my wrist
Didn't impress all them chicks that I craved for
Now I don't even need to say shit
Bitch need I say more? (nah)
This my personal life this a personal right
You can turn from the light then shine on niggas like a baby at birth
Just peeped this first bit of life
Right

[Bridge]
Shine, Shine
Shine, Shine

[Verse 2]
Can't block it where the E clips?
