[Hook]
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga

[Verse 1]
This a true flame, this ain't butane
Who changed when you called? Who came?
Still do, never falter
You know I rock with you like Gibraltar
Ain't no pressure, how 'bout me and you make a movie in memories
Remember, now that's forever
Gotta love the way we put it all together
Lord knows I love the way He put you all together
You are stellar, and I'm a champion
Clique full of real niggas, living way up in the hills, nigga
My next door neighbor's a Hilfiger
Big gate cops can't come thru
Got chicks down for the one-two
Got one thing, she the one to
Lord, how many of my dreams gon' come true?

[Refrain]
With you I could be patient
Limousine, that's a little tad much for you
Ain't no need, put some weed in that blunt for you
We go deep girl, we go deeper
I can tell when it mean that much to you

[Hook]
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for a nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for a nigga, don't

[Verse 2]
Don't front, when you see me in the city and your friends, they  talk about me
Talking down about me, how they say I ain't committed
What the fuck they know about me?
Told you everything there is to know about me, still you doubt me
I got niggas in the state and the county and the city
All my niggas that escaped, 100k to Sallie May, let me get the record straight
We gon' see some better days, facts
Bassy Bas the Basquiat of rap then basket my pain and left on my needs
Peel on these scars, appealing to bars
It's something I need to function, not me
It's nothing I need, nothing like you, so that's what I need
Looking for you, and you and I need it, got justice side
You to my dreams, you were my angel, viewing my demons
You are now in all of my sins, I pray you're undo
All that I been, I pray it come through, I pray it come too
I pray it come true

[Bridge]
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for your nigga, don't

[Refrain]
With you I could be patient
Limousine, that's a little tad much for you
Ain't no need, put some weed in that blunt for you
We go deep girl, we go deeper
I can tell when it mean that much to you

[Hook]
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
Don't front for a nigga
Don't front for your nigga, don't
