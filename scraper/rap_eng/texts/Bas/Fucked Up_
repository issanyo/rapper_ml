Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro: J.I.D]
Shit, okay

[Verse: J.I.D]
Lil' dirty, nappy-headed East Atlanta nigga
Father said that I was a force
.44 hanging at your dome
Make it home, then get out the Porsche
Lil’ nigga covered FADER 'fore I had to fade a nigga at the [?] fort
It's tomato or tomato, either way, that booty [?]
I won’t say it no more
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to turn the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown
Board of Education vs. Brown
I was ward of education, left the town
Fuck a résumé and fuck a cap and gown
Fuck a background check back 'round when I get the check
And nigga that's now

[Chorus: J.I.D]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to turn the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown
(Woah, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to turn the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown

[Verse: Bas]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
Pick up the pad, pick up the slack, pick of the litter, don't litter no bag
I see the [?] in them racks, that's when declare it I’m accurate too [?]
And I’m back in the booth, got em hackin' and shackin’ [?]
'Cause they lackin' the juice, niggas drop from the ball now they on Shaqtin' a Fool
Activis drool out the side of your face, lean jackin’ it, with-

[Verse: Cozz]
[?] in the mud, it is what it is, it was what it was
A fling is a fling and a fuck is a fuck
I got your girl and the world on my nuts
I got my luck up, my shit [?] down-
