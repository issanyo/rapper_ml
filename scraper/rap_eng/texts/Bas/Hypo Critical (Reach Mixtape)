Yeah
IPhone full of compositions
Lost in my mind got
God as my witness
Fighting with he Devil, I think he be winning
Fucking all these hoes, I think I be sinning
Nights in her house, God damn I be slipping......
But a nigga love the mouth, who I'm kiddin?
Placed pussy over life, the way that I be hitting
You would think the Holy went missing
Aimed to be perfect, Man I be Missing
Angel on my shoulder, man, he got to dipping
Couldn't stand still, all this henny in my system
Knocked him right off, God damn I be tripping
Hot headed nigga, but a man on a mission
But I can't change the world untl I change my ways
Til then I say confessions then roll the haze
Got God on my mind while my head be blazed
