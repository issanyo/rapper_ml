[Intro]
Got them speakers in my ride
I like to keep 'em bumpin'
I'm hustling, chasing dreams
In hopes that I could become something
I threw a party, she say Bassy, thank you, but it's nothin'
Cause I had to keep it jumpin'
Ya a'int  Blake Griffin, but I know that you be jumpin'
Poker face stiffin', but I know that you be bluffin'
No, I don't be cuffin', all these ducks be gettin' ends
Rubber duck etcaeterin', and I'm the pain
I left to make, and can't be ya crutch and meta...

[Verse 1]
Piffy lined up, fired up in the dutch
Or the EZ Widers, slide up, six speed
Like clutch, the city on me, I'm clutch
No Worries they depending on me, I'm clutch
Toast up mimosas at thirty thousand feet
Henny in hand, land, can make it out my seat
Michelin man, making grip up out the street
Grab The D cup on the freak, played that bitch and press repeat
J-Walkin' thru time zones, I'm on that trip
Got yo piece of the pie, and you pawn that shit
I'm takin' all that shit until I own that sis
College shit get mind blown, I'm on that quick
She got expensive addiction and a nose that's rich
Nothin' betta than brown dough that's on that stick
A lil' hashish, shiish, baby
If you roll it up with some keif, Super Mook
Super Mook chasin paper 'bout my loose leaf
Rollin papers yeah I do chief
Meditatin' like I'm Bruce Lee, at the Carter like I'm Tunechi
Riddin' thru the borough while this cutie feed me sushi
Salmon, avocado and an order of the cuchie
Charles De Gaulle to JFK
Brods givin up the draws like I'm JFK
Guess I'm flawed, after all, ain't nobody perfect
Do it all just to ball and the shit is worth it
Fiend

[Bridge]
It's like that now
Quick, fuck that let me get back

[Verse 2]
I'm in L.A. but my Jays got sand from Dubai
I'm getting brains all day like I'm Magna Cum Laude
Cause, while you boys planked I was getting more stamps
Now my passport shitting on your whole camp
Fuck ya Instagram, that monkeys do delivery, that instant gram
Damn, put them ones up for them ones that's above us cause we miss them man
And to the niggas stuck up in the can
And slam a cage up in ya body put cha body up in a different plan
Different plain
Same hustle different game
They don't love you if they always wanted you to stay the same
Slidin' through the 'jects, now I'm slidin' through the W with different dames
That's a W nigga figure that shit is game
I just keep doubling figures until my niggas ain't
Pedelin' pills and kaine
Cause in the streets, or the industry man them presidents still the same

[Outro]
Them presidents still the same
I get that green back
I see stacks and relapse
Fiend Bas, I mean that
I need that
