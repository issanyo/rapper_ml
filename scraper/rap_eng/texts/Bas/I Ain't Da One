[Intro]
Fuck, what time is it? C'mon, man

[Verse 1]
Look girl, I see the sun is comin' up
What the fuck is up? Girl you trynna cut a rug or what?
If you trynna front, bitch I ain't the one, I ain't the one
Don't be trynna stunt, got some bud and one vanilla dutch
Roll another blunt, mooked
Got you slow-mo so, even if we rush by the time I cut
It'll be feelin' like a couple months, but it's only what?
10 minutes in this rented truck
Girl I only want 10 minutes in this rented truck
Got them windows foggin', hazy baby
Wildin' I'm an 80's baby
Super mookin' fiend we found nirvana like that naked baby
Danica, Patrick, way she strip this chick is racy
There they go, her top, her bra, draw, I'm reachin' for her daisys, daisys, daisys, I'm reachin' for her daisys, then I screech in that mercedes I be ghost like Patrick Swayze, Swayze, Swayze
Girl yo ass is crazy if you think I'm wifin' you
This some shit I'd write for you

[Hook]
I ain't the one for you, I ain't the one for you
I ain't the one, nope, yeah
I ain't the one for you

[Verse 2]
I say, beau beau, hold a nigga dick right quick
Beau-beau, hold a nigga dick right quick, I say
Beau-beau, hold a nigga dick right quick, I say
Beau-beau, hold a nigga dick right quick, yeah

[Outro]
And we everywhere, fiend flight, club fiend, [?] roll the grass up and he light it like a light bulb
And we everywhere, fiend flight, club fiend, [?] roll the grass up and he light it like a light bulb
Like a light bulb
Like a light bulb
