[Verse 1]
Ay Ced
My nigga just roll one, let the storm settle
Feel like a lightning storm and I'm on metal
Feel like this life is a long walk thru nights to long coats with knives and nigga we all cattle
Crabs in a bucket this is a small barrel
.38 mag blast yo ass with a long barrel
Boy meet the devil
Tell him come off you apparel
For that pearly white ice, your life is in peril
The needle ain't sterile
The wound is infected
Broke as a joke
So the wounded neglected
This ain't a joke tho, it's foolish to mess with a man on the edge
Shit that's just a death wish
You in some shit now
Float in the septic
Pitch em your goals but the throw intercepted
Your niggas is grimey
Your ho is deceptive
Highway to life and theres only one exit
But fuck it I veer off a road that is less followed Â 
The orchestra led and the guests followed
The trumpets blow leave your chest hollow
Violins play your sins on the strings and it sing it go

[Hook]
We want mula (mula)
Yea we want mula
Oh we want mula (mula)
Yea we want mula

Hmmm
Yea thats what the fiends want (and I'm a fiend)
Said thats what the fiends want (nigga)
Yea thats what the fiends want (and im a fiend)
Said thats what the fiends want (nigga)

[Verse 2]
How come everywhere I go I see a liquor store?
How come that nigga a vet but yet that nigga broke?
How come a nigga gotta die for you remember me?
How come the middle of July feel like Decemeber?
See the summer time is killing season
Kiss my momma every day boy I'm barely breathing
Bunch of heathens round me rather see me under cement
Paranoia but this mook will keep me off the deep end
So much beef in these city streets
I pray you go vegan
War torn from war stories man where do we begin
Niggas is carbon dioxide just waitin to seep in
While you sleepin leave your brain matter splattered and leaking
Find a pastor a deacon, rabbi or imam
Tryna fly my way to heaven but this turbulence is strong
My momma taught me right
My city taught me wrong
They say I'm on my way
I pray it won't be long
Need sunshine leave the city unwind
Shine so hard God the city leave son blind
The city is unkind
The city get no sleep
I rummage her underworld
The city is so deep
And it preach

[Hook]
We want mula (mula)
Yea we want mula
Oh we want mula (mula)
Yea we want mula

Hmmm
Yea thats what the fiends want (and I'm a fiend)
Said thats what the fiends want (nigga)
Yea thats what the fiends want (and im a fiend)
Said thats what the fiends want (nigga)

[Outro]
