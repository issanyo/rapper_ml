[Intro]
I need that
That pussy I need that
That good weed
I need that
Nigga I need that, I need that
Yo' feed back don't need that

[Verse 1: Cozz]
You bitches
You ain't shit, I swear you think you poppin'
Cause you instagram famous
This ain't the fuckin' same kid
You was fucking with me
I sat back didn't say shit
Now I done lost my patience, ugh
Well if you ask me how I'm livin' I'm just livin' life
From South Central to the waters where these kids reside
I'm a South Central LA nigga just a different type
Went to MiraCosta so the homies think I'm getting white
Hit the beach at day
Then I'm back at 65th at night
Bitch I ain't complaining I just really have to shed some light
Still leave the crib and make sure I don't forget the knife
The Knife got me feeling like I'm superman
But praying I don't run into a crip tonight
That orange nike sign looking red in a different light
Niggas rather kill than fight
Familiar faces drown me but that attitude swi-switch at times
Ha, 'lotta pain 'lotta funerals here
I'm still standing like I just lost in musical chairs
Praying that my cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup, cup
Fill to the brim, brim, brim, brim, brim, brim
I need that

[Hook: Cozz]
I need that
That pussy I need that
That real shit, they need that
I got you, you need that
I need that
Yo' feed back, don't need that
Liquor I need that
That good weed I need that
Yo' feed back don't need that
I need that
That pussy I need that
That real shit, they need that
I got you, you need that
I need that
Yo' feed back, don't need that
Liquor I need that
That good weed I need that
Yo' feed back don't need that

[Verse 2: Bas]
My team stacked your feedback, don’t need that
My crew rollin' and see hoes at each show
Scream I love, don’t know them
All facts, you tall tales, you got shells, you don’t load 'em
Claim parts that bang hard they don’t know you
I just had hopes and bars, now its Nova Scotia corporate cards
Friendly hoes and open bars
Make a wish girl, hold a star
The joke is off, play the game and know your cards
I hope that you came to show 'em off
Don’t be ashamed to show 'em off
Let’s play the game below the bra
Bitch, don’t be ashamed to show 'em off
But hold your heart, I'ma do it 'til we runnin’ the game
Top floor in the Bay and fuck it
When I overdone it I never done it in vain
Do it for my niggas ‘cause we one and the same
We just rented a house for a week, I need that shit forever and ever
If I got it, I wonder, whatever would happen to me
Cause I just keep meetin’ new people
That I can't remember and wonder “How did we happen to meet?"
I used to think niggas like that was assholes
And now I’m like "How did that happen to me?"
Strapped to the seat, I’m killin' the crash course
Eyes on the road, eyes on the road but never the dashboard
If I want to know, If I want to know your opinion I’d ask for it nigga
My team stacked, your feedback, don’t need that
My crew rode, and see hoes at each show
Scream I love you don’t know them
All facts, you tall tales, you got shells, you don’t load 'em
Claim parts that bang hard they don’t know you

[Hook: Cozz]
I need that
That pussy I need that
That real shit, they need that
I got you, you need that
I need that
Yo' feed back, don't need that
Liquor I need that
That good weed I need that
Yo' feed back don't need that
I need that
That pussy I need that
That real shit, they need that
I got you, you need that
I need that
Yo' feed back, don't need that
Liquor I need that
That good weed I need that
Yo' feed back don't need that
