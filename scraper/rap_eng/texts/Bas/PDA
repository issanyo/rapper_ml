[Refrain]
I just wanna talk until your phone dies, I don't know why
Girl, you got me so high
So, I been tryna make up some alone time, on a low time
Just to get away

[Verse 1]
I think I could spend with you my whole life, fuck these hoes lies
You know they got no lives, you know they got no lives
One hundred
Sense somebody true, got a feeling
And every girl I meet got a ceiling
And you know I'ma always keep it real with you

[Chorus]
One hundred, one hundred
Got all of the things I wanted
One hundred, one hundred
Do all of the things that I wanna do
One hundred, one hundred
Do all of the drugs that I wanted
One hundred, one hundred
You're the only drug that I wanna do

[Verse 2]
I'ma rock the bow tie, do the whole nine
You won't even show light 'til it's show time
And you gon' shine so bright, so bright
Illuminate the whole sky, oh my
My niggas gon' be drunk as shit, talkin' shit
They gone joke, yeah, life is over, toast to this
I know this a new beginning
I know I find that shit obvious since you descended (I know)
It's you who did it, one hundred
Might be too early for talkin' about marriage
I got some business I gotta attend
You got some dreams to achieve on your end
I know that we the busiest of bees
But I hope we get to be at the end
End of the day ain't nothing 'bout you basic
You the woman that can teach me some patience

[Chorus]
One hundred, one hundred
Got all of the things I wanted
One hundred, one hundred
Do all of the things that I wanna do
One hundred, one hundred
Did all of the drugs that I wanted
One hundred, one hundred
You're the only drug that I wanna do

[Refrain]
I just wanna talk until your phone dies, I don't know why
Girl, you got me so high
So, I been tryna make up some alone time, on a low time
Just to get away
