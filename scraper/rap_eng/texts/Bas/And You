[Intro: Token]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Token]
Young ass kid with great ass credit
Even my DJ said it, torture me to a insane menace
Ocean view, we ain't jealous
Life is a beach, that beach ain't Venice
Pull up with a racket like Wii Play Tennis
My bitch look like Elaine Benes
Dirty mouth, I don't groom, wife the bitch, nah I don't groom
Foreign bitch, Heidi Klum, scoop the bitch, I'm the spoon
Bitch the witch, I'm the broom, dead the bitch, I'm the tomb
Good afternoon, how ya doin'?
Oh, I'm okay man, I can't complain
It ain't my shit if it don't bang
Look, my forehead got the "V" vein
That "V" stand for "Very Deranged"
I get a zombie, but ya need brain
I get her kidneys where my kids hang
I get a big dream and a big name
I get your bitch key on my keychain

[Pre-Chorus: Token]
Ayy, ayy (Ayy, ayy)
Hop in the game and break the fence, mayday (Mayday)
I'm in this game to make some ends, pay-pay (Pay-pay)
I'm in this game to make some friends, hey-hey (J-K)

[Chorus: Token]
I'ma kill you and you and you
You and you and you and you and you (Yeah)
You too, you, and you, and you, and you, and you
Who?

[Verse 2: IDK]
Who? Him
Shot, shot (Ah!)
Duck, duck (Down!)
Make a nigga run like goose (Uh)
Pull up in the backstreet, pull out that heat
Scream "Ricky!" Boyz n the Hood
Red beam and I speed off
Balancin' the rap and trap and so she's soft
Give a nigga asthma attack, he can't breathe, y'all
You don't really understand, you need ESOL
With feet off, I still run the rap game for the new niggas
My career feel like the new Jigga
Your career feel like the new Tigga
Can anybody tell me who bigger? Who figure?
I don't really fuck with industry friends
If you really know what's up, most niggas pretend
Everybody want beef, everybody's reachin'
When you ready for the smoke, everybody's ePen
Everybody's sleepin' on the kingpin
Make a nigga really seep in when I creep in
Booked every fuckin' weekend 'til the week ends
You keep tryna pretend you don't see him
'Til I blow up, ISIS, Middle-Eastern, boom!

[Pre-Chorus: Token]
Hop in the game and break the fence, mayday (Mayday)
I'm in this game to make some ends, pay-pay (Pay-pay)
I'm in this game to make some friends, hey-hey (J-K)

[Chorus: Token]
I'ma kill you and you and you
You and you and you and you and you (Yeah)
You too, you, and you, and you, and you, and you

[Verse 3: Bas & Token]
Not what I want, but I feel like I planned it
I am the iceberg in the Titanic
Bas sink ships, bitch, better than this do
You and you and you and (You)
No rap crew, let's keep it organic
No fast food, bitch, keep it organic
Come on my tour bus, see an assortment
Fruits and host a killa, too
You and you, hers and his
Told my bitch I don't chase no bitch
Yeah, fuck I chase a bitch for?
Now I ain't got the patience
The countin' got my wrist sore
Been flippin' through big faces
Them Benjamins, they packed in
They claustrophobic (Get 'em)
Bassy dope and Token hold consignment
Comin' off the corner like a blown assignment
Blowin' chronic, bitch I saw you shinin'
Settin' fires with the phony diamonds
Made me laugh 'til I hold my side
Your jeweler drive a Uber on the side
You niggas sus, you won't come outside
With some of mine, NY, let's get it

[Pre-Chorus: Token]
Ayy, ayy (Ayy, ayy)
Hop in the game and break the fence, mayday (Mayday)
I'm in this game to make some ends, pay-pay (Pay-pay)
I'm in this game to make some friends, hey-hey (J-K)

[Chorus: Token]
I'ma kill you and you and you
You and you and you and you and you (Yeah)
You too, you, and you, and you, and you, and you

[Verse 4: Token]
Ayy, tell my fans I'm a genius (Genius)
Tell my girl that I'm leaving (Goodbye)
My bitch ask me for the truth, I told her the truth is I got secrets
Comin' home, my cologne smell like money and hoes
Oh no my mama no believe it
Hotel room got too much space, I could fit all my demons
All my demons, all my habits, all my homies
How y'all feeling?
Feelin' in charge, get in my car
My bitch ass got a Michelin star
I don't sleep, I don't set alarms
When I speak, it's a seminar
If I said the bar, then I set the bar
I could buy your self-worth with my debit card, God damn
