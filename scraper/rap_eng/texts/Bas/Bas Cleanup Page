Dreamville's signee Bas has been given a huge platform thanks to J. Cole so we intend to cleanup his songs as much as possible. Previously he showed up to Genius and was able to co-sign and create annotations over some of the songs seen on his sophomore album, check it out here! The purpose of this page is to keep track of the songs that have been fixed. Also a huge thanks to Babuc for creating this cleanup guideline as he originally created the Pop Cleanup. Anyways each song will be judged from 0-5 on the annotation about the song, with 0 being empty/close to empty, 1 being in terrible shape (covered completely in bad annotations), 2 being in meh shape (halfway covered in bad annotations), 3 being in ok shape (has some of both), 4 being in pretty good shape (mostly Genius 'tates), and 5 being in perfect, lockable shape. 5 is what we're shooting for!

Check out the tracklist for Bas' albums below. Note that this includes an artist bio, album descriptions, and other important to-dos!
