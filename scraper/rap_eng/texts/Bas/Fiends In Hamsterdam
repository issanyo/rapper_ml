[Verse 1: Bas]
Let these niggas know Bas got sicker flows
Ride low, eyes closed, hydro, piccolo
And them bitches know Bas got thicker dough
Fly you Cairo, eyes low, poconos
Poke a ho next week, I skip a ho, try you, by you, all I’m in it for
Never hit it raw, less I hit it raw
Why you, lie you, know you slippin for
Never lie, never front, never cheat
But I chief hella blunts every month, every week
Every day, every hour she mookin fiends thourpees
Purple beats or sour keys
My speakers get you off yo keester, form a crowd and scream
Fuck you too, the coward leave
So fly, I shit stars

Big fry I large, them girls make you hard, we ménage
My mind got sick bars

Ridin round the city with her bitty inflated
That’s blowin my phone, I know that same chick you dated
Got me going like ocho loco, I know that drink is invigorating
Fat shots to the underrated

You will see my goons fly past
All black Jag, all black mask
All black rata ta ta ta ta ta
You threw white rags, why?

On these tracks, miles ahead, you twice lap
Ego bruised, you come through
With ice packs I come through
With 5 bags, why why why
