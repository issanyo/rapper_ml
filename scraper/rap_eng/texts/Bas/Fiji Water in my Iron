[Intro]
Why you so dramatic?
Why you so dramatic?
That's enough
You think I give a fuck or you talk static
I'm holdin' heaven it's automatic
You think I give a fuck or you talk static
I'm holdin' heaven it's automatic

[Hook: Bas & K Quick]
Cause I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Yeah I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Ho I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Yeah I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Cause each day we wake up
We smoke L's we make love
We bump Soul in your basement
Bump Cole in my truck
Cause we ride, we ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride, we ride

[Verse 1]
It's just me, you, Jack and Ginger
Mary's here my dear
No need to ask I'll bring her pour me a glass
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone
And if it's mine that's you honey
Stick together like new money
Hit Dubai on that dune buggy
Catch some rays like it's Tampa Bay
And I know what drives you crazy
On how I switch daily
From love is so amazing
To love is so enslaving
Yet all you have is patience
Fight for us as if life is love
If love is gone it's dead life in us
I repent all my sins
Always trynna put knife in us
I hear my devil's enticing but
They run amok every night
They love to fuck WOOP
They ain't nothin' but some pressure cause
Pressure bust
Promise for the two of us, I never rush
It's just me, you, Jack, and Ginger
Mary's here my dear
No need to ask I'll bring her, pour me a glass
I'm in my zone

[Hook: Bas & K Quick]
Cause I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Yeah I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Ho I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Yeah I gotta stay fresh
Fiji water in my iron
Cause each day we wake up
We smoke L's we make love
We bump Soul in your basement
Bump Cole in my truck
Cause we ride, we ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride, we ride

[Verse 2]
And she was like Lauryn Hill tell him
I was trynna be a player still on my Bill Bellamy
But she couldn't understand
Cause everytime we go out we go out with a bang
She just want a taste
Fill up with regrets now you get em by the text
Bitch you never wear the smiley face OK
You can tell me bout it or you can tell it to the ace
Cause we never let it go to waste
Don't you ever let me go to waste
Black star so we couldn't burn out
Like black cards we ain't gettin' turned down
My God gon' get the word out
That's laughter my bitch got ass like NASA
That line prolly only makes sense to me
That's fine I'm the shit to me
That's fine I'm the shit to me

[Outro]
Why you so dramatic?
Why you so dramatic?
