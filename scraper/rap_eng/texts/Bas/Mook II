[Verse 1: Bas]
Smokin that good
No Reggie, No Theus
My niggas the G'est
Don't shit come between us
No money, No hoes
Don't shit come between us
How we play dirty but step out the cleanest?
G shit bitch learn the meaning
From here to Medina, I bag all the model chics
Call em Athena, cause they are some Godesses
My politics don't got no policies just livin life everyday no apologies
Apologies for the delay I was up in the stars rollin up on astrology
Economies in disarray but a couple mixtapes gon put me in ecology
Ecology?
Ecology, that's green nigga
Global Warming, that's me nigga
Heatin up, They ain't keepin up
Had a taste, I ain't eat enough
Hoes fast like they let a whole day pass without eatin none
If the 44's rung, Hemdi's the one
If them hoes open, I'll leave with them
One

[Hook]
You in a hot air balloon
You could be around the moon
You eat a pound of the shrooms
You'll never be higher than I am
You could mook all of the keef
You could blow all of the schneef
You go as high as you reach
You'll never be higher than I am
You'll never be higher than I am ( so high)
You'll never be higher than I am (so blown)
You'll never be higher than I am (I'm Mooked)
You'll never be higher than I am ( I'm Mooked)
I'm Super Mooked

[Verse 2: Hemdi]
Should I tell my story?
Or should I show my scars?
This is Hemdi and Bas, this is avant garde
Niggas swear they smart, till they ass get snatched thru the fog
I got a couple bitches think they slick, but far from espionage
Me and 3 bitches, that's just a collage
I'm an artist of a rare kind, you just a facade
The quiet sun, metamorphosis, I have just evolved
My horizon bright and I box thru life like Cus was involved
Muhammad Ali, the Iron Mike-ness
If I lay somethin' down and it's war time nigga no women no kids that kill is righteous
Got blood on my glasses, give me a second to wipe it
Lets proceed when it touch white folks I guess that's when it becomes a crisis
But we still in the ghetto, where we chase money and hoes
The OG's said "Thank you, young fella
I guess nobody had the courage to write this"
And we drive foreign cars, But the evil drives us
And we ride on each other so easy
Cause the demons ride us

[Hook]
You in a hot air balloon
You could be around the moon
You eat a pound of the shrooms
You'll never be higher than I am
You could mook all of the keef
You could blow all of the schneef
You go as high as you reach
You'll never be higher than I am
You'll never be higher than I am ( so high)
You'll never be higher than I am (so blown)
You'll never be higher than I am (I'm Mooked)
You'll never be higher than I am ( I'm Mooked)
