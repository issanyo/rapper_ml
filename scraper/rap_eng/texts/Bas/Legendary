[Intro]
*Phone ringing*
Hello?
Yo Bas, Waddup boy
It's poppin' man
Chillin' chillin'
Tired, you shouldn't have been fuckin' wit' these bitches last night
[?] right now
I'm at the crib right now, got this bottle of Henny. You tryna Fiend out?
Yea buddy, ahh, hold on a second, hold on a second

[Verse 1]
Matty P, the baller, I call ya in a minute
Got this bitty on the other line, and damn she can get it
Pussy like credit, no limit
Imma spend it in a sec, why Daddy what you mean, I was finished
Rolled the spinach, fancy dinners, yea
Yea right, Hoe say hello to Ham and glutten grimace
I ain't broke, flying Frankfurt out to Venice
Floss so much, reprimanded by my dentist
He said "Bas man, you gon' pull your teeth out"
My bitch walk around like Prince, with the cheeks out
My connect on Deck, bring the reef out
And if I'm there, bitch I finna bring the streets out
So fuck a beef, cow, bull and a mill
Shoutout to my Emcee niggas in the Ville
Finna get this paper, stack a couple bills
High up to the sky, that's a couple mil
Bas
