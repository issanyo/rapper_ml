[Hook]
Amazonian queen
Amazonian queen
Amazonian queen
Could you be what you seem, Amazonian queen

(Verse)
Vines in the ravine
Swing down from your throne and bow down to your king
What a life we chose, nothing but hoes
The good ones, few and far between – getting hard to see 'em
Come on Eileen, could you be my visine
I’m in need of your light, could you be my high beam?
Only for a few nights, I ain’t quite what I seem
In your city couple times a year, you know what I mean
Yea, you know what I mean
Bitch, you know what I mean
Girl, you know what I mean
I don’t move keys but I got room keys
All the salty women leaving on a sour note
All the sweet ones end up chiefing on my dab of smoke
Only evening that’s in question we was laid up at the Weston
Keep some candles that be scented, until it does
Fuck you think the towels for?
Fuck you think the towels for?
Fuck you think the towels for?
For the loud  gotta dampen the sound yea
Gotta dampen the sound yea...
