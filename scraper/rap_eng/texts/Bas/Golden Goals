[Verse 1]
General guidelines to ride by
Can't kill my vibe, you couldn't find mine
Come to New York City, I'm in the skyline with a fine dime
And nigga we ain't fine dining
Hit the Halal stand for cheap plates
Hit the high line, that's a cheap date
I ain't worthy, fuck it who is?
Do what you do girl, fuck it you lit
Hundred niggas yelling "New York back"
I hear em rapping they only set, "New York back"
I'm in Queens to Harlem, the Garden I rap
And I'm only hearing New York clap
Bout to move out to Cali, got a little thing out the valley
And this one girl at hollywood hookah
I wish I knew to show her how to maneuver
Truth, through the city like a presidential motorcade
On my way so the motherfuckers don't shake
Never mind I'm just smoking that grade A
Running with the same niggas since grade eight
You ain't never seen no strange ones appear
My niggas been the same ones for years
I don't do it for the peers, I do it for the fam
Man, all of my angles are clear
Other day yo, I was shopping on Rodeo
Got a call from my nigga Cheyo
Said the hood hot bro
Gotta get away yo
Losing niggas like every day
Told 'em 18 months I'ma get a tour bus
Coming up and we never looking back
Need a rut to the cuts that bleeds deep
Three ducks in the truck like beep beep

[Bridge]
Life is what you make of it, it's play-doh
This year, this year man goes back to the moon

[Verse 2]
If you coming to my city wanna know the deets?
I'm the embassy, I'm the one to see
Yeah baby, yeah baby
From over here but I took it over there baby
Riding in the drop, let your hair crazy
Climbing to the top going stair crazy
Crazy how the game opened up
A nigga ain't been home for some months
But when I get home I be posted up
Do it for the city til the coast is us
From a city where a nigga turn a penny to a twenty
But when the penny turns friends turn to enemies
As semis turn urns into memories
Make shots nigga burn like the Hennessy
The city got problems, the city's so godless
I watch it all burn like it's heresy
Witchcraft for your bitchass, which craft is you gift at?
I live in the moment, the moment is timeless
I hear all your talk but you're so unaccomplished
Opinions are nonsense
And I ain't got time for opinions to process
These days I'm inspired by me and nothing else
Bottles of tequila and some weed and nothing else
You know my niggas with me and no one else
I ain't pressing you can hold them hoes, sudden death
Got golden goals
