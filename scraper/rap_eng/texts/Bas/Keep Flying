I keep flying x3
I keep grinding,i keep riding
You keep trying to ground me but my feet won't touch the ground, I keep flying (won't touch the ground)
I keep flying
I keep shining, my feet high and
You can't find me cause I'm way to high in the sky,i keep flying I'm in the sky
I keep flying x2

[Verse1: Bas]
Man I'm addicted to spending more money than I earn
I see the police then I'm quick to make a U-turn
Riding with my top down lost my mind
And he didn't see it coming like he gone blind (wonder why)
Nah he was running then I shot him from behind
Sending chills down his spine
I'm on point like porcupines
Like a cactus tree
Boy we on a killing spree
All 7 days we be murdering these so called weak mcee's (booom)...
Uptown boy's it's the uptown boy
But you probably couldn't tell with how the girls make noise
They'll be screaming louder than a Justin Bieber show
Stop playing nigga this what we rehearse it for
Making all that money for
Get the girls we couldn't get before
Make another hit put it in a body bag and then a pit
Rocket scientist when it comes to that pistol
Put a silence on the tip make that motherfucker whistle

[Verse2: Sheezy]
Told Trayn and Bas we would to make it one day
Now it's three cities all in one day
Now it's thirty bitches all in one day
Road to success that's my motherfucken one way
Picking models from the runway to the runway
Taking flights to different sites
Then leave them on a Monday
Keep my pants low I ain't playing with you Urkels
Yeah yeah we don't fuck around so we play for different circles
Matter fact fuck you squares
We tired of your presence
Tell Santa to remember we where ballin before December
Now I'm all up in the capital tryning to raise my capital
The money came in local but these whore's be international
My Merc merk the street
My Benz hit the bends
Smoking out the revelations it's the genesis of your end
That trap that's where I bee's don't let me my goons swarm nigga
Uptown I make rain after the storm nigga

[Verse 3: Trayn Blacktie Dillinger]
I got Robin Hoods ethics
Martin Luther's dreams
Baby go get this what mama said to me
So ya'll can not blame this
On my mama's dream
Well really ya'll can take this up a fucken hole
No matter how you rate this I'm hot ya'll cold
No matter how you look at this I'm rich ya'll poor
No matter how I do it I will never ever fall
And no matter how hot she is, she always gonna call
You can see it in my eye the tiger
Who hotter than us uptown we flyer
Kill them with bars they confessing to the chart
So they don't dig in my past and try bring up my priors
Fire keeps burning how I'm earning
Gun for hire
And my getaway swifter burning rubber off the Tyre
Best believe that we far from done
We've only just begun

I keep flying
