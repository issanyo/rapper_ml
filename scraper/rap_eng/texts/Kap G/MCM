[Chorus]
Magic City on a Monday
Yeezys on like I’m Kanye
Pull up on her on the runway
Polo jammies, yeah, I’m comfy
Niggas runnin' with the fengshui
Linen suit on a Sunday
Think I hit her on a Wednesday
That ain't what I call a hump day

[Verse 1]
Swear that pussy felt like Yoplait
I’m a rockstar, word to Cobain
Keep the bands like I’m Coldplay
I’ve been ballin' on them just like Coke K
The police still stuck in their old ways
They gon’ get off like they OJ
Y’all just actin' like it’s okay
Stuntin' like my daddy O’Shea
I’m dripped up in all this Dolce (designer)
I’ve been still out like a probay (designer)
Rule number one: yeah, they gon’ hate (let 'em hate)
Water top tees up in Norway
I’m eating good fuck a cold plate
And my vato got them low rings (yeah)
Ive got two chicks who go both ways (yeah)
After I fuck, buenas noches (Kap G)

[Chorus]
Magic City on a Monday
Yeezys on like I’m Kanye
Pull up on her on the runway
Polo jammies, yeah, I’m comfy
Niggas runnin' with the fengshui
Linen suit on a Sunday
Think I hit her on a Wednesday
That ain't what I call a hump day

[Verse 2]
I do not care what your friends say
Quit all that blockin', Dikembe
Me and my bae the new Kimye
And I feel like the GOAT like I’m MJ
Drippin' in sauce, I’m the sensei
I get a hundred dollar temp fade
I’m a magic with the shrimp steak
Baby, take that address where your friends stay
Last year I ain’t had shit
This year I’m gettin' mad rich
I want the arroz with the catfish (woo)
Hit my DM, just don’t catfish (for real)
I just wanna date an actress
I’ma beat it like I’m Cassius
Put the playboy bunny, way more money
David Blaine with the hat tricks (Kap G)

[Chorus]
Magic City on a Monday
Yeezys on like I’m Kanye
Pull up on her on the runway
Polo jammies, yeah, I’m comfy
Niggas runnin' with the fengshui
Linen suit on a Sunday
Think I hit her on a Wednesday
That ain't what I call a hump day

[Verse 3]
I just might throw out your rings, she wanna stay at the pent', yeah
I wanna truck with the brakes, I got the gas and it stinks, yeah
Hit the hoes at the same time, I had them yelling out, "Jinx," yeah
If Donald Trump go build the fence, we gon' get that and fend, yeah
Real niggas gettin' the sting, rest in peace to that boy Chinx, yeah (RIP)
My sauce drippin' like a scene, I got her sippin' the drink, yeah (drippin')
She tatted with all the ink, she naked under that mink, yeah (woo)
Soon as we get to the crib, I'ma slid over them pinks, yeah (Kap G)

[Chorus]
Magic City on a Monday
Yeezys on like I’m Kanye
Pull up on her on the runway
Polo jammies, yeah, I’m comfy
Niggas runnin' with the fengshui
Linen suit on a Sunday
Think I hit her on a Wednesday
That ain't what I call a hump day
