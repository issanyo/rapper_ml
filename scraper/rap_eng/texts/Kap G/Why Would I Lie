[Hook]
I’ve been down there like a hundred times
Why would I lie I’m a get this money till I die
Why would I lie I just roll that green I get so high
Why would I lie I’m a get this money till I die
Why would I lie hey hey hey
Why would I lie hey hey hey
Why would I lie I’m a get this money till I die
Why would I lie I just roll that green I get so high
Why would I lie

[Verse 1]
50 migo deep on riding the Acura
TMZ shooters them ain’t no cameras
The teachers said I’ll probably end up a janitor
Waffle House meals, now my eggs scrambled up
Better cuff your girl  I just might catch her up, poof
Now she going abra cadabra , buying my swag
This shit ain’t adding up I need 10% Kap G your manager
I told you like a hundred times this ain’t no dollar signs
That’s  a waste of time will you ball up will you man up
When the judge give you nine
Hey I might drink a line f**k it
Corona with the lime hey I might sit your girl for six seconds
Yea enough to make a vine eh workers in the field picking apricots
Lock your doors because the robbers masking out break into your house steal your Macintosh vegetarian this an apple watch
My name Kap G but I don’t capitalize
Like J caprice I like to rap a lot hold on Revlon
You are trap a lot why would you was handing out
I’ve been down there like a hundred times

[Hook]
Why would I lie I’m going to get the money until I die
Why would I lie I just roll that green I get so high
Why would I lie I’m a get this money until I die
Why would I lie hey hey hey
Why would I lie hey hey hey
Why would I lie I’m going to get the money until I die
Why would I lie I just roll that green I get so high
Why would I lie

[Verse 2]
High as a parachute I will embarrass you
Jordans on tied a knot like i married you
Amazing what she will do for a pair of shoe
Come in like a senior I feel like a mayor too
I’m about to kill them like my name is Terry U
Opps I mean Terry O what’s your scenario
They will be right here need to go to a burial
My life is a movie follow me on periscope
I rather stock a dime you can chase a dime
I ain’t got time
My boy keep the strap I’ll be down too if I ain’t got mine
I’m up in mulla agent mulla
Eh baby him my last say she want to blow me
That’s a dandelion
Why would I lie Why would I lie
What you going to do when you run out of supply
What you going to do if the partner you knew
Turn his back up on you take a piece of your pie
I’m from the south where you fold and you fry
Slide up in my dm and I might reply
A player young and I sense I may retire
Cook a tray onion rings on the side
Done it like a hundred times

[Hook]
Why would I lie I’m going to get the money until I die
Why would I lie I just roll that green I get so high
Why would I lie I’m a get this money until I die
Why would I lie hey hey hey
Why would I lie hey hey hey
Why would I lie I’m going to get the money until I die
Why would I lie I just roll that green I get so high
Why would I lie hey
