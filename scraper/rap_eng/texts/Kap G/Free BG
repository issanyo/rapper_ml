[Chorus]
I been up for 2 week, I just plant like tupee
Racks insidemy jewlry, maybe why she choose me
Oo, yeah, Drew Brees, pass her hard, no QB
Yeah, yeah, 3D, all my diamonds 3D
Bitch I'm from the CP, down the street from CC
I feel like I’m BG, reminder free BG
They all know where we be, posted with a riri
Houses was TP, now we flexin' VV

[Verse]
"That's just how I want it", she said that before she top me
I can’t do nothin' bout that, there too many of 'em want me
She like drinkin' all that and she drink all of it like it's coffe
She been in her feelings, had to tell her "bitch get off me"
Had to tell that bitch she gotta fall back (fall back gang)
Baby where was you when it was all back (all back gang)
If want with me shootin' in the junk, can't get beside me
Tell me who you know that can do it better girl, besides me

[Bridge]
Baby tell me, who you know can do it better
Baby tell me, who you know can do it better
Baby outta' town when she call me
Look at my collection now they all back

[Chorus]
I been up for 2 week, I just plant like tupee
Racks insidemy jewlry, maybe why she choose me
Oo, yeah, Drew Brees, pass her hard, no QB
Yeah, yeah, 3D, all my diamonds 3D
Bitch I’m from the CP, down the street from CC
I feel like I’m BG, reminder free BG
They all know where we be, posted with a riri
Houses was TP, now we flexin' VV

[Outro]
Remeber the times she ain’t call back
Look at my girl, now they all back
