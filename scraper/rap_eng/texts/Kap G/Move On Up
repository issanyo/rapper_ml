[Verse 1]
Move on up, U-Haul
Shorty say, you ain't shit, she can suck my two balls
I just sit back think Deng like Luol
Keep a Trojan in my pocket but I'm still too raw
It's all a joke to you huh? Like Lil Duval
But I kept my mind straight, said fuck you all
My boy quick to get the heat, I gotta tell him cool off
He aiming till you fading with the red nose, Rudolph
Brother used to hit the dice game with a dollar and some
Come back to the crib, he got a couple of hunnids
Don't get me wrong he took a couple of losses, double or nothing
They lose your whole pay check, it like you working for nothing
They blowing on the octane, cooling in apartments
They going fuck with different College Park, down to Compton
God dang, God dang, with his headbump in
Never said shit when the cops came, nothing change

[Chorus]
We gon' move on up (Let's get it)
And move on up (Arriba)
Move on up (Let's get it)
We gon' move on up
George Jefferson, move on up (Let's get it)
We gon' move on up (Arriba)
George Jefferson, move on up (Let's get it)
We gon' move on up
We gon' move on up (Let's get it)
And move on up (Arriba)
Move on up (Let's get it)
We gon' move on up
George Jefferson, move on up (Let's get it)
We gon' move on up (Arriba)
You know where the justice
So it's only right that I gotta do my thing

[Verse 2]
That lil Kap-G ball, RIP to George Jefferson
I was the man in high school, motherfucking letter men
I'm just getting better man, I'm just getting cheddar man
Hit up Magic City, make it rain like the weather man
Aww shit, she wet again, I let her hit the medicine
They treat me like a veteran, get banned Led Zeppelin
I like a bitch who elegant, I think she from the Netherlands
All black on, yeah I'm blessed like a reverend
Bet on me
When I see police
They want to be on me
I ain't saying I'm a saint like New Orleans
But every time they see me they want to see ID
Shit, I wouldn't be surprised if they on my IG
Why you stressing G?
Keep some tree, like the logo on LRG
Kap G getting money, what the fuck y'all mean?
This for my partner gambling like the football team

[Chorus]
We gon' move on up (Let's get it)
And move on up (Arriba)
Move on up (Let's get it)
We gon' move on up
George Jefferson, move on up (Let's get it)
We gon' move on up (Arriba)
George Jefferson, move on up (Let's get it)
We gon' move on up

[Bridge]
Growing up I done met a lot of people who don't like me
And I'm blowing on their gas, that's that diesel mixed with octane
My brother got a dollar, he gon' go hit the dice game
You know where the justice
So it's only right that I gotta do my thing

[Outro]
