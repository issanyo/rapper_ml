[Intro: Kap G]
Fuck La Policia, ayy
(Que Pasa, holmes?)
Fuck La Policia, yeah eh

[Chorus: Kap G]
You see, the cops pulled me over
The cops pulled me over, ayy
Now I’m just ridin’ wit my migos
Ridin’ wit my migos, ayy
I’m screamin’ fuck la policia
Fuck la policia, ayy

Fuck la policia, ayy

[Verse 1: Kap G]
Where ya at?…Catch me on the south side
And Im riding with my top down
Fuck that cop Mike Brown Im brushin,feel like Pac now
Migo with an attitude,Im screamin fuck the cops now
Wanna do it 10 like the BET countdown
Can't believe theres no peace
I can't breathe,I can't breathe
Ain't gonna see Honor, let 'em leave, he free
Fuck the police and I ain't got no preacher with me
I think they mad cuz I get dope
California peace a kitchen
Posted on the highway tryna catch my speed limit
Yo,why yall ain't in the hood tryna stop a speedin bullet
Its the work of mean mullet, Travon Martin, keep a hoodie
Cop that bullshit like Audi did everything they thought I couldn't

[Verse 2: TI]
You know I slide through wheneva
Ride through whateva
Lock eyes with the police
Pass by like whateva
You know Ima keep the pistol under my seat
And the choppa in the trunk
If a sucka out of line,fuck the police
Ima give em what they want
Comin live from the west side
Tell em buddies saw a cop murder that guy
See that about it
We know when they pull us ova they gon’
They gon pull us out the car
I ask em why they fuck we mu they say cuz I know you got it
Learn early keep yo mouth close
Neva tell nobody, until it’s it’s justice
Just fuck the police, see how it go

[Verse 3: David Banner]
I’m yellin’ fuck the police
AKA them white sheets
Let them white folks come
Everybody yellin’ “peace”
Let me bump you in the club
Them Ks are coming out at me
They say ‘Banner they gon’ get you’
Then I guess I’ll die free
And I’d die to be a G
Why, you muthafuckin’ addict
Don’t forget to OD
And they mighty, said he gangsta
But I guess they don’t see
They killin’ and feelin’ our sons
The ceiling’s with slugs
All the rain of blood
Left on the rug, blood
Left in the streets, Mike Brown dead
Left in the streets, Aiyana Jones shot dead
Dead in the sleep, Eric Garner, choke man

[Chorus: Kap G]
You see, the cops pulled me over
The cops pulled me over, ayy
Now I’m just ridin’ wit my migos
Ridin’ wit my migos, ayy
I’m screamin’ fuck la policia
Fuck la policia, ayy
I be like fuck la policia
Fuck la policia, ayy

(Outro)
This for black and brown all ova the world
United! I know there some good ones out there
We ain’t talkin’ bout y’all, no, man!
