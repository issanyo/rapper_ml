I’m used to working the day shift
No more minimum wages (No)
All you gotta do is have patience (Yeah)
I’m at the four seasons, no Days Inn (Uh)
Got tired of waiting
I’m bringing home the bacon
Smokin’ this gas like a vape pen
I swear the feeling amazing
Look at this ice I’m draped in (Ice)
Tokyo nights when the Bape In (Bape)
Tone more sharper than Jason
Free all my partners who caged in
I came up, yeah
