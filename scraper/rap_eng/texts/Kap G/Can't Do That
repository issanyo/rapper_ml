[Chorus]
You can’t be doing that shit
Good luck talking to these hoes, ain’t know your bros
You can’t be doing that shit
Playing both sides somebody gotta die
You can’t be doing that shit
Saying that you gon shoot be the first to tell the truth
You can’t be doing that shit
Talking bout you sell drugs know you lying and a [?]
You can’t be doing that shit
Tryna watch how I wield
You can’t be doing that shit
Catching play where you live
You can’t be doing that shit

[Verse 1:]
Posted in a trap gotta keep a strap keep it on ma lap
Trap house jumping gotta serve omten that pistol on go
Fuck niggas at the market so don’t be doing that shit
Hey i’m just chilling doing a bitch
Keep a fucking pot in ma crib
He want a baby so get him a bill and don’t be playing

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
You can’t be doing what I do to my bitch
Got ma hoe beefing with her partners I wish I had 2 of my dicks
I bet you don’t know what to do with a brick
Ask how many ounces in one he probly say 26
Your shooter a bitch he talk too much I know he a snitch
We taking a risk refund ma chain i’m raising ma steak
Your circus trick the shit you should be heavy [?]
Talking bout you rapping cause you super broke you cannot be fixed
Hell no you can’t be doing that shit
Ma partner locked up need a dime I sent him 2 of them quick
Bro he whipping till he spraining his wrist I witnessed it
Cash Out tell em again don’t think they listening

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You can’t be doing that shit  who on the [?]
[?] got lean in the whip
Here don’t get wrong cause they leave you with 2 in yo hip
And I might go through a zip police tryna got to the whip
Arite shit I hope they do not trip
Taking selfies with a bitch she did the clique ain’t tattooed her lip
You can’t be doing that shit
Rocking all that fool fool passing round that fool fool
Passing round your partner true, no no
You can’t be doing that shit
Man be wifing all these hoes meet the plug in mexico
Cash Out they ain’t doing this shit
I’m in the club in the VIP
I’m in the fast and the furious I call it Tokyo drift
I be first blunt yea I lift my vitals move Taylor swift
Ain’t talking animal darkness but I pull up in a Vet

[Chorus]
