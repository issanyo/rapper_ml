[Verse 1: Castro Escobar]
Riding dirty, it's like 7:30
Right lane while my tires burning
Drink while my stomach's hurting
Workaholic boy I'm always working
Built my wave then I fucking surf it
Landscape for all the serpents
Wake up to the same shit, lame shit I see it everywhere
You can't tell me nothing 'bout struggles if you was never there
You can't face my people and think that we just gon' run in fear
And ain't no way you can tell us we don't belong in here
Fuck a wall Trump, fuck 'em all up
Got my bars up, way too far up, can't get caught up
See lately I been peeping my brothers, they pay the price
Then make the trip, and then they makin' like double
I fucks with no rubber, the game a hoe but fuck it I love her
For her I'm a sucker, I ride, my shit be jamming like Smucker's yeah
I hear them saying I'm the truth now yeah
I hear them saying I'm the truth now

[Chorus]
I tell em that's my fuckin' work (yo)
Yeah, that's my work (that work?!)
I tell em that's my fuckin' work (that work?!)
Uh, that's my work (know my 'migo got that work)
Tell em that's my fuckin' work (yo, leggo)
That's my work (yo,yo,yo leggo)
I tell em that's my fuckin' work (you know my 'migo got that work)
That's my work (work?!, that work)

[Verse 2: Kap G]
Know my 'migo got that work
They gon' hit you where it hurt
Oh my god, she gon' pop a Perc
I think she 'bout to go berserk
Polo Ralph Lauren shirt, yeah
Girl I can't lie girl, I'm a flirt
Hit my vato got the chirp
They got my back just like a burp
I been hustlin' since a young'n, it ain't nothin', I made somethin'
I turn nothin' into somethin', you turn somethin' into nothin'
I-I-I been tryna get that money
I been tryna get that paper like my nose fuckin' runnin'
Man, you know how I'm comin'

[Chorus]
I tell em that's my fuckin' work (yo)
Yeah, that's my work (that work?!)
I tell em that's my fuckin' work (that work?!)
Uh, that's my work (know my 'migo got that work)
Tell em that's my fuckin' work (yo, leggo)
That's my work (yo,yo,yo leggo)
I tell em that's my fuckin' work (you know my 'migo got that work)
That's my work (work?!, that work)

[Verse 3: Snow Tha Product]
Look, that's the boy
That's my young'n off you oui
That's my gat, and bitch got plastic parts but no it's not a toy
Get that right, we don't stop
Got that work, on the job
Got the juice, got the sauce
Got your man like "Oh my god!"
I got some bad bitches, all latin chicks
Doing figure 8's in a classic whip
Long way from that small apartment
Not having food so we rationed it
Now I got the work in my celly, got a private party in my tummy
Got a Puerto Rican thing tell me that even my light work esta heavy
Bitch, the rap game María Félix
You better off checkin' and respectin' the name
Ain't nobody ever do me no favors
I'm pickin’ a speed and I swerve in my lane
Get this work, get that bag
Get the Perc, got the Xan
Get your servin', get that cash
We got your girl, not coming back
We got that work

[Chorus]
I tell em that's my fuckin' work (yo)
Yeah, that's my work (know my 'migo got that work)
I tell em that's my fuckin' work (that work?!)
Uh, that's my work (that work?!)
Tell em that's my fuckin' work (yo, leggo)
That's my work (yo,yo,yo leggo)
I tell em that's my fuckin' work (you know my 'migo got that work)
That's my work (work?!, that work)
