[Hook: DJ Outta Space]
I walk around with it and any of you haters can get it
I only tote 100s and 50s and no we ain't having no limits
Hit the mall to buy it all cause all we know is just spend it
Hit the trap to get it back cause all I know is just spend it
I walk around with it and any of you haters can get it
I only tote 100s and 50s and no we ain't having no limits
Hit the mall to buy it all cause all we know is just spend it
Hit the trap to get it back cause all I know is just spend it

[Verse 1: DJ Outta Space]
Pull up to the trap, I need all mine, no cap
Coming up in short and new school in it but we ain't going for that
Real meals with me, boy, shout out my nigga Kap
And we he talk 'bout that balling bull, we used to that
Fucked up Sax, and we fucked up Lynx
Took flights across seas for expensive linen
Your girl asked me for a bad man, I told her later
How dare your ass get mad, I did your ass a favour
And when it comes to haters, we just laugh at those
Just a bunch of niggas that ain't used to getting hoes
Ain't used to getting dough, so they cocky watch me
Watch me cash out and take all offenders, Rocky

[Hook: DJ Outta Space]
I walk around with it and any of you haters can get it
I only tote 100s and 50s and no we ain't having no limits
Hit the mall to buy it all cause all we know is just spend it
Hit the trap to get it back cause all I know is just spend it
I walk around with it and any of you haters can get it
I only tote 100s and 50s and no we ain't having no limits
Hit the mall to buy it all cause all we know is just spend it
Hit the trap to get it back cause all I know is just spend it

[Verse 2: Kap G]
I walk around with it, you don't wanna fuck around with it
Ain't nobody fuck all Lynx, and we gon' fuck all bandits
My bitch gon' fuck your bitch and she let me fuck her women
And I like to sip that drink, I'm up, got fucked up kidneys
Designer women, I be swimming
Rep the truth and my denim
Hit the plug, he gon' send 'em
About the cream, no filling
Percocet with no winter
Percocet with the venom
I know Migos in the kitchen whipping babies
I ain't talking 'bout branding, yeah
South's thug, John Lennon
She on book with my 50
Tryna get me a really
And we ball like [?]
Sipping Ace and Chameleon
I am legend like Will in here
Never been the type to kiss and tell
Just the type to have your bitch and yell

[Hook: DJ Outta Space]
I walk around with it and any of you haters can get it
I only tote 100s and 50s and no we ain't having no limits
Hit the mall to buy it all cause all we know is just spend it
Hit the trap to get it back cause all I know is just spend it
I walk around with it and any of you haters can get it
I only tote 100s and 50s and no we ain't having no limits
Hit the mall to buy it all cause all we know is just spend it
Hit the trap to get it back cause all I know is just spend it
