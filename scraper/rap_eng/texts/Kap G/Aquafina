[Chorus: Joe Trufant]
Gucci girl, acting like a choosey girl
Wrist splash like it's Aquafina
She say she don't want to get between us
I said she just want me for the money
She say she just do it for the visa
Wrist splash like it's Aquafina
She said she don't wanna get between us
I think she just want me for the money
She say she just want me for a feature

[Verse 1: Joe Trufant]
Louis bag across your body, but i paid it's mine
Paid in full, the diamonds on my wrist they block the time
I just pulled up in your city but i barely know ya
I might have to do it, pay bout' 20 for the rolex
Jewels switch sides like i'm doing Macarena
Diamonds in the light got lil mami tryna' team up
I don't ever ever wanna lose shawty to the scene yeah
Drip on the face, drip on the face
Look, splashing like it's water
Pull up with the VS, I'm in business like a startup
You stay in designer, yeah that doesn't move me girl
You act like you won't but you gon' choose me girl

[Chorus: Joe Trufant, Adlibs: Joe Trufant & Kap G]
Wrist splash like it's Aquafina (like it's water)
She say she don't want to get between us (never naw naw)
I said she just want me for the money (cash yeah)
She say she just do it for the visa (Splash)
Wrist splash like it's Aquafina (like it's water)
She said she don't wanna get between us (i know you wanna)
I think she just want me for the money (for the splash yeah)
She say she just want me for a feature

[Verse 2: Kap G]
See my neck splash yeah that's Aquafina
Might buy the vette cash, forget the visa
I charge you S Class, yeah for a feature
I used to skip class now i bust my teacher
Shoutout the plug, he mail that
I feel like the man, run and tell that
I met her shopping at fairfax
She fell in love with Chanel bag
She fell in love with Chanel swag
My ?
Fly young mule, got jet lag
Put my money on her, we can bet that
This real water, you can test that
I ain't pulling up, where check at
Came from the trenches, yeah we did that
I ain't never ever getting sent back
I ain't never ever getting sent back
Gucci girl she drip that
Diamonds come in HD
You can see it pitch black, Kap G

[Chorus: Joe Trufant]
Wrist splash like it's Aquafina (like it's water)
She say she don't want to get between us (never naw naw)
I said she just want me for the money (cash yeah)
She say she just do it for the visa (Splash)
Wrist splash like it's Aquafina (drip)
She said she don't wanna get between us
I think she just want me for the money (for the splash yeah)
She say she just want me for a feature
