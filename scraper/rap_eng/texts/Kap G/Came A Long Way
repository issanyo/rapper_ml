[Intro]
I just stayed down, yeah
I just stayed down
I just stayed down, yeah

[Chorus]
I just cut em off now am I wrong
'Cuz everybody love me like they did when I was down
Now they come around
Tryna give me pound
I just went around
I just stayed down

[Verse 1]
I just stayed down
Now I'm flying into town
Smelling like a pound
I put water on my bitch now she tryna drown
Baby stay down for the [?] don't make a sound
Can you stay down?
I'm a million dollar nigga
Need a billion dollar bitch
I was born broke but a nigga plan on dying rich
I can't go outside
Wake up, text you back
All my bitches bad
That's why these hoes mad
Looked at my bitch [?] 200
Hopped out, tell that girl I need a coupe
You niggas getting handouts like I owe them something
But where was you when I had nothing

[Chorus]
I just cut em off now am I wrong
'Cuz everybody love me like they did when I was down
Now they come around
Tryna give me pound
I just went around
I just stayed down

[Bridge]
You ain't starve with me
You ain't eat with me
Keep my dog with me
I swear we were balling
Yeah we made it this far
We done came a long way
I was happy to see you made it
But the money in the way

[Verse 2]
I got thoughts in my head
But I just keep em to myself
I can't walk in your spot
Unless my shooter to my left
I said Imma make a name
Just can't put me on the shelf
Double Gs on my belt
YSL on my belt
They ain't felt what I felt
They ain't dealt what I dealt
Imma roll me up a L
We ain't ever taking Ls
We ain't gotta ask for help
We still riding with them [?]
Told my plug to drive 'em here
We ain't tryna check the mail
2018 bought the new AP
Swervin' off in the 2018
Go two-way D
Steppin' up all the blue cheese
In the Balmain jeans
Boutta go make a movie
And it's all HD

[Chorus]
I just cut em off now am I wrong
'Cuz everybody love me like they did when I was down
Now they come around
Tryna give me pound
I just went around
I just stayed down

[Bridge]
You ain't starve with me
You ain't eat with me
Keep my dog with me
I swear we were balling
Yeah we made it this far
We done came a long way
I was happy to see you made it
But the money in the way

[Outro]
I just stayed down, yeah
I just stayed down
I just stayed down
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
