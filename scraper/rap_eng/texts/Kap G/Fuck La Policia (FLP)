[Chorus]
You see the cops pulled me over
The cops pulled me over, ayy
Now I'm just riding with my migos
Riding with my migos, ayy
I'm screaming fuck la policia
Fuck la policia, ayy
I be like fuck la policia
Fuck la policia, ayy

[Verse 1]
Now I don't got a Bentley, just in my hyundai car
And I know what you thinking, think I got no green card
Man fucking 'round with ya'll I'm 'boutta hit that bay line
Think I push work now he bringing out the canine
They trying to lock us up, always riding on our block
Think I work at chop shops, no this ain't a hotbox
Cause I'm Mexican yeah on some young migo shit
Trying to search in my whip trying to find some fucking bricks
And my uncle he illegal, my uncle he illegal, ayy
And I can't fuck with la migra, can't fuck with la migra, ayy

[Chorus]
You see the cops pulled me over
The cops pulled me over, ayy
Now I'm just riding with my migos
Riding with my migos, ayy
I'm screaming fuck la policia
Fuck la policia, ayy
I be like fuck la policia
Fuck la policia, ayy

[Verse 2]
So the cops pulled me over, say the windows too tinted
Basically saying that my migos ain't from here
I don't give them two minutes, I get my ticket and leave
Think I got no I.D like the migo make beats
And my bro tatted up they think he MS13
No he bang Latin Kingz, they trying to go lock him in
And all this happened last night, I don't your advice
I don't got my pistol on me quit flashing your flashlight
Where your license registration? My license registration, ayy
Trying to sent me to the fucking immigration, the fucking immigration, ayy

[Chorus]
You see the cops pulled me over
The cops pulled me over, ayy
Now I'm just riding with my migos
Riding with my migos, ayy
I'm screaming fuck la policia
Fuck la policia, ayy
I be like fuck la policia
Fuck la policia, ayy
