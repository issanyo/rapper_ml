[Verse 1: Kap G]
Okay, I be going hard since I was ocho
I got some model from the UK on the coco
She tat my name on the cheque, damn that my logo
I tell her bounce up on this dick, just like a pogo
I just want your body, show me how you ride it
Say we in a relationship, I can't even deny it
Standing on the cashes, designer studied office
You ain't gotta worry, girl, I'm plugged in like an outlet
Make her call me papi, and drive me like a chauffeur
She make it look so fussy, she love that Vida Loca
I'm horny, you don't wanna go home
You know that, we been going loco
