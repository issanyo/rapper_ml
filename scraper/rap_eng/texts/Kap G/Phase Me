[Intro: Raven Felix]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Kap G]
I hear ‘em talk but they don’t phase me, yeah
I got money but they don’t phase me, yeah
I got hoes but they don’t phase me, yeah
Do what you gonna do but it don’t phase me, yeah
I hear ‘em talk but they don’t phase me, yeah
They can talk but they don’t phase me, yeah
Do what you gonna do but it don’t phase me
Say what they wanna say but it don’t phase me
It don’t phase me

[Verse 2: Raven Felix]
Yeah
Didn’t know I would take it this far, no no
Feel like a big dog
Now you wanna play in my shit dog
Fuck off my clit dog
Bending my dough (?), then I get more
Ima skirt off in your bitch car
We take it back to the crib
Now she ain’t picking up his call
Be about it, don’t just talk about it
They ain’t talking money, gotta change the topic
Man, that shit don’t phase me
Ain’t no way around it
Ima stay 100, gotta keep it grounded
Don’t you try to play me for no sucker, baby
We just like to chill, we not a couple, baby
I ain’t got no time to be cuffing, no no
You catching feelings, you in trouble

[Chorus: Kap G & (Raven Felix)]
I hear ‘em talk but they don’t phase me, yeah
(But shit don’t phase me)
I got money but they don’t phase me, yeah
(It don’t phase me)
I got hoes but they don’t phase me
(Nah)
Do what you gonna do but it don’t phase me, yeah
I hear ‘em talk but they  don’t phase me
(It don’t phase me)
They can talk but they don’t phase me, yeah
Do what you gonna do but it don’t phase me, yeah
Say what they gonna say but it don’t phase me
It don’t phase me

[Verse 3: Raven Felix]
Yeah
Didn’t know I would take it this far, no no
Feel like a big dog
Now you wanna play in my shit dog
Fuck off my clit dog
It’s always the people that wasn’t there
That always wanna say what they didn’t hear
They can’t speak up or be clear
Cuz they know it’s made up, they don’t care
But it’s all love, no tears
I heard it all
Trying not to get my feelings involved
They wanna hate but I make it so hard
They only show off fake love, I don’t want it
I keep it close, I got snakes in my yard
Know I got bottles and more shots to pour
No one consent, they just won’t see me fall
Tell ‘em do right, got it wrapped like a scar
Pick up your man and them ima skirt off
You had him now he won’t pick up your call
Fucking with me then you catching a loss
Dirt on my shoulder, I brush it right off

[Chorus: Kap G & (Raven Felix)]
I hear ‘em talk but they don’t phase me, yeah
(But shit don’t phase me)
I got money but they don’t phase me, yeah
(It don’t phase me)
I got hoes but they don’t phase me
(Nah)
Do what you gonna do but it don’t phase me, yeah
I hear ‘em talk but they  don’t phase me
(It don’t phase me)
They can talk but they don’t phase me, yeah
Do what you gonna do but it don’t phase me, yeah
Say what they gonna say but it don’t phase me
It don’t phase me
