[Verse]
I wanna get me a Wraith, I wanna get me a Wraith
I wanna get me a Wraith, I wanna get me a Wraith
I wanna get me a Wraith, I wanna get me a Wraith
I wanna get me a Wraith, I wanna get me a Wraith
Got it on my own, undocumented
Yeah I represent it, plus I drive a Bentley
Master Splinter when they asses spit it
I pad the finish, the cash I get it
In labs I'm chemist, the bag ascended
The crack is in it
Puttin' nothin' out but dope shit
So you know the 'migo very focused
Plus I ain't never goin' back to broke shit
Now you actin' like my bro, shit
Nothin' less than a hunnid
If I speak it it's the truth
They sayin' I'm slept on
I'm Tempur-Pedic in the booth
Won't repeat it, don't you snooze
HD when I drop them jewel
No late fees, just pay your due
Pay me in hunnids we cool
I was at the [?], now I'm 'bout to buy a safe
Proved 'em, went and bought a Wraith
That shit really motivate
Now my name holdin' weight
Shooters with me, Golden State
We about to overtake
Tell Trump we broke the gate
I grew up on Weezy F, fuck the street with BMF
Stealin' out the CVS, we were kids PBS
DJ Khaled, We the Best
And they don't wanna see us blessed
Gave us seaweed from the west
Now she Fiji, got her wet
Kap G, you dig what I'm sayin'
