[Verse1 : Roscoe]
Well, look at you, girl just stopping traffic (lord)
Adidas Adidas, don’t wave the assets (lord)
Might touch it, I just wanna see if it's plastic
She make that dick disappear, now that's a magic
Trick, how you do that? Make me wanna chew that
My killer baby chew that, pop pop, top flew back
She open wide, took me by surprise, them hips and thighs
I leave her sanctified, take some piles taste of mine
Sinner, sports centre, high life boys in her
Far from beginner, I enter her cable
No water part in her ways
Before we parted ways
As we lay all I'm thinkin' is this short PCR cable
I don’t remember her name
I forget, but I do hit homers
She Marge'd it, I'm in penny loafers
Smack that ass on any sofa or
Things that serve us a coaster that close
She bend it over the closer
Right get to use
Like im putting in her into you
She Comatose that concludes i hope you go
Send her back in an Uber
And deal with the local joke her
All day all night
She dreamed soo Roller Coasters
Hurry that night out white out
As i over evoke her
