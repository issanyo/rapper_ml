[Intro]
I want that motherfuckin' power
I need that motherfuckin' money
I don't need these motherfuckin' hoes
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
See these folks just don't get it
I been holdin' in all this pain
I get off in 4 minutes
And I still gotta take that train
And the police don't get it
And you folks tryna take my life
And when you die, can't go with it
I be damned if I don't get right, yeah
They done fucked around and let a migo get some money though
I ain't never been nowhere, you know I'm from the barrio
Yeah, I got hope in my veins
Yeah, no dope in my veins
Yeah, I got hope in my veins
Yeah, no dope in my veins

[Verse 1]
Take a trip to my community, black and brown unity
This shit ain't new to me
These people like foolin' me, I'ma keep doin' me
I'm doin' my own shit, these suckers ain't suin' me
Funerals, too many, I been to too many
She want the new Fendi, I want the blue pennies
You keep on talkin' 'bout you, see the new in me
Trump keep on talkin' but he ain't go do anythin'
I been through too many things, we been through too many pains
Take a trip to my side
You won't let to on his name, we was insane
But who's to blame?
I been hangin' with the old killers, dope dealers
Why you worried 'bout me? That ain't your business
I be feelin' like Wayne on No Ceilings
I ain't sparin' nobody, ain't got no feelings, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
See these folks just don't get it
I been holdin' in all the pain
I get off in 4 minutes
And I still gotta take that train
And the police don't get it
And you folks tryna take my life
And when you die, can't go with it
I be damned if I don't get right, yeah
They done fucked around, and let a migo get some money though
I ain't never been nowhere, you know I'm from the barrio
Yeah, I got hope in my veins
Yeah, no dope in my veins
Yeah, I got hope in my veins
Yeah, no dope in my veins

[Verse 2]
I be from where they totin' them things
Had a convo with God and he told me some things
He said these niggas fly, man, you owe us some things
Your baby mama, had your dope in the Range
Been workin' my move, I been goin' through things
My partner just came out, did 4 in that thing
My old friend told me that I totally changed?
Or is it 'cause you stayed the totally same
I been turnin' up on the weekends, yeah
Mama still workin' house keepin', yeah
Still can't let a nigga come cheat me, yeah
Drop top, now how's life been treatin' ya?
I been doin' fine, my partner's doin' time
Fuck the police, yeah, all they do is shine
Money on my mind, yeah, God been givin' signs
I just gotta shine, I just need to shine

[Chorus]
See these folks just don't get it
I been holdin' in all the pain
I get off in 4 minutes
And I still gotta take that train
And the police don't get it
And you folks tryna take my life
And when you die, can't go with it
I be damned if I don't get right, yeah
They done fucked around and let a migo get some money though
I ain't never been nowhere, you know I'm from the barrio
Yeah, I got hope in my veins
Yeah, no dope in my veins
Yeah, I got hope in my veins
Yeah, no dope in my veins

[Outro]
Like no, no, no, no

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no
