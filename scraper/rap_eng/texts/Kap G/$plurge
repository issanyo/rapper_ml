[Verse 1: ZeuZ King]
Skinny Jeans but my p-p-p-pocket be on 3x
I'm cold wit the money so I treat it like a Kleenex
Treat yo girl like she recess, She swinging on my penis
She never gave head, I said come and give me "V" neck
Got bands to blow that's saxophone
Y'all niggas broke must of cracked a bone
I smell like that mula, Y'all smell like that axe cologne
I blow da purp, I smoke da purp
It put me in my happy zone
I blow da purp, I smoke da purp
It put me in my happy zone
Im a freshman, I don't mess with you class of clones
You call that lady baby, I got that bitch acting grown
I'm swerving to the riches
You haters just some plastic cones
ZeuZ on da track I'm out I'm gone

Pocket use to be hurting
Now you see me splurging
Cut checks like surgeon
Got your bitches thirsty

Splurge 4x
Splurge 4x

Pocket use to be hurting
Now you see me splurging
Cut checks like surgeon
Got your bitches thirsty

Splurge 4x
Splurge 4x

[Verse 2: Kap G]
Ok pockets use to be hurting
This belt right here hermes
Couple lawyers typing me contracts
Amigo Microsoft wording
My migo phone keep chirping
We the Ringling Brothers no circus
Stay with presidential blunts
BITCH, IM THE SECRET SERVICE
I say that money, dinero, tortilla, no spatula
Got four bitches, they legs up
My bitches like tarantula
I'm in Panama
Making business phone calls, I'm a manager
Don't know you, I keep a small circumference no diameter
My Vito, my Vito
They the plug, they some immigrants
I need to be on medicaid, I stay on that medicine
I'm with my G-Unit
Just like fifty and them
I pull up in Honda Civics
You know it's about fifty of them

Pocket use to be hurting
Now you see me splurging
Cut checks like surgeon
Got your bitches thirsty

Splurge 4x
Splurge 4x

Pocket use to be hurting
Now you see me splurging
Cut checks like surgeon
Got your bitches thirsty

Splurge 4x
Splurge 4x

[Verse 3: ZeuZ King]
Fashion assassin, Closet a casket
Just trying to ball, attacking the basket
Just want it all so I can not pass it
Fantasy balling, Put down the madden
Flow so cold, They want to Jack- it
Basement always Jordan classics
New Era on my attic
PUFF PUFF THAT MAGIC DRAGON
Obese car fit two lanes
Killer kicks, Liu Kang
Married to the money
Mary Jane just my boo thang
Head gassed up
Why you think I spit them blue flames
I'm a Titty Boi, I can't wait to be a 2 Chains
Pocket use to be hurting
Now you see me splurging
Cut checks like surgeon
Got your bitches thirsty

Splurge 4x
Splurge 4x

Pocket use to be hurting
Now you see me splurging
Cut checks like surgeon
Got your bitches thirsty

Splurge 4x
Splurge 4x
