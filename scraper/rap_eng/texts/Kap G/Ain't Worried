[Intro]
At all
What could I beats
Yeah, yeah, oo

[Chorus]
Those days used to be the worst days
Now I pull up holdin' thirty
Slide in you bit like a third braid
Feel like I'm talking to a mermaid, oo
Heard you got pressure I ain't worried
Look at my way, they hear me
Ask a lot of questions like a survey
Why you asking questions in the first place, oo
Heard you got pressure I ain't worried, at all
My boys in the trap, get the sack off
Heard you were the plug but they ran off
Pull them bands out, yeah we can have a band off
Before handouts, I'll go cut my hand off
You made a little cash now you 'bout to cut your man off
That's a stab in the back, now go take your cap off (that's cap)

[Verse 1]
I was just talking to my friend
What we gon' do when we get to the Ms?
Drop the sunroof when I go and get the Benz
She can come too, but it gotta be tens
I can't trust you, weren't with me back then
I got two up in the pool with a London accent
I ain't ever liked school, but I made it rappin'
I'ma need nine pools when I get the mansion, yeah

[Chorus]
Those days used to be the worst days
Now I pull up holdin' thirty
Slide in you bit like a third braid
Feel like I'm talking to a mermaid, oo
Heard you got pressure I ain't worried
Look at my way, they hear me
Ask a lot of questions like a survey
Why you asking questions in the first place, oo
Heard you got pressure I ain't worried, at all
My boys in the trap, get the sack off
Heard you were the plug but they ran off
Pull them bands out, yeah we can have a band off
Before handouts, I'll go cut my hand off
You made a little cash now you 'bout to cut your man off
That's a stab in the back, now go take your cap off (that's cap)

[Verse 2]
I know I'm destined for this so you can never interfere
I know I'm blessed so that's why I gotta keep it real
I am the best, admit it, she said she just love how it feel
Runnin' through checks, the bridge, yeah, and now I'm getting head on the wheel
I got people on my heel tryna' tell me how to live
I'm the man of the year, tell me now we gon' get rich
Give a fuck what you feel, I'ma kill 'em with the drip
Give a fuck what you feel, I ain't missin' no meals
Put some ice on my neck, now it's giving me chills
Put some ice on my neck, now I'm swimming with the eels
Livin' life on the edge want a house on the hills
Only life in the hills, I ain't talkin' 'bout wills

[Chorus]
Those days used to be the worst days
Now I pull up holdin' thirty
Slide in you bit like a third braid
Feel like I'm talking to a mermaid, oo
Heard you got pressure I ain't worried
Look at my way, they hear me
Ask a lot of questions like a survey
Why you asking questions in the first place, oo
Heard you got pressure I ain't worried, at all (at all)
My boys in the trap, get the sack off
Heard you were the plug but they ran off
Pull them bands out, yeah we can have a band off
Before handouts, I'll go cut my hand off
You made a little cash now you 'bout to cut your man off
That's a stab in the back, now go take your cap off (that's cap)

[Outro]
Heard you got pressure I ain't worried, at all (at all)
