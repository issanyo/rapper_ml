[Intro: Kap G]
All of my diamonds like water
Lotta drip (drip)
You know
Go and put that lil drip on it

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All of my diamonds be water
I don't even need no camera light
I ain't even got no license
I'ma have to get me a driver, sike
Said she ain't never been to Georgia
Tell me when you ready, I'ma book the flight
Nigga ain't gave me nothin'
Bitch better have my money right
Hundred racks in the shoebox
I remember wearing Reeboks
Now I'm buying diamonds, Icebox
Wake up bored, buy a new car
Niggas hate, I guess it's they job
I ain't never had a day job
Niggas quick to post what they got
Then they wonder why they got robbed

[Verse 1: Kap G]
Show 'em my diamonds like water
Yeah just like Miami
Gotta be a front for a louder
She about to take that xanny
Did I mention I'm on fleek?
Name another artist harder
4PF Dominique
Lil Baby what y'all call him
Every other night different model
Spent 'bout a band for the iPhone
Cash in that head honcho
And your bitch choosing, I know
Knew a boy go here
Ayy bro these Louis frames, nah these ain't cyclops
I'm my own boss, can't call off beefin' 'bout a ho, no I can't fall out
I ain't even got no daughter, but she call me her father, yikes
I used to ride on MARTA, now I want to cop me all that ice
I just had perfect timing, I'ma just let these rappers bite
I just left Benihanas, I ain't even have no appetite

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All of my diamonds be water
I don't even need no camera light
I ain't even got no license
I'ma have to get me a driver, sike
Said she ain't never been to Georgia
Tell me when you ready, I'ma book the flight
Nigga ain't gave me nothin'
Bitch better have my money right
Hundred racks in the shoebox
I remember wearing Reeboks
Now I'm buying diamonds, Icebox
Wake up bored, buy a new car
Niggas hate, I guess it's they job
I ain't never had a day job
Niggas quick to post what they got
Then they wonder why they got robbed

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Pourin' fours in the soda
Doing shows, now they know me
You ain't even gotta pay
Better act like you owe me
Bustdown on the Rollie
I'm with George, that's the brodie
Stayed down, now I'm loaded
Get this money 'til I OD
I just made a lot of profit
Spent it all on some watches
Elliante, Avianne
Magic City every Monday
Going for it, I ain't punting
I'm the boss, I really run it
Bad bitch, Laura London
Everything I want I done it
Now my clothes come from London
All my dogs be some hunters
I make 'em call me honcho
Knew one day that I'd be stuntin'
All I needed was the money
Now I finally got the money
Racks on me, all hundreds
Drip season like I'm Gunna

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
All of my diamonds be water
I don't even need no camera light
I ain't even got no license
I'ma have to get me a driver, sike
Said she ain't never been to Georgia
Tell me when you ready, I'ma book the flight
Nigga ain't gave me nothin'
Bitch better have my money right
Hundred racks in the shoebox
I remember wearing Reeboks
Now I'm buying diamonds, Icebox
Wake up bored, buy a new car
Niggas hate, I guess it's they job
I ain't never had a day job
Niggas quick to post what they got
Then they wonder why they got robbed
