[Hook]
I come out stepping out every day like it's a fashion show
150 on the highway smashing down there we go
I got Alexander Wang riding with me, it's a fashion show
My vato pull up with the pack, disappear, a magic show
I ran up a check (I ran up a check)
I hopped in the 'vette (I hopped in the 'vette)
I had to go do it (I had to go do it)
I had to go do it (I had to go do it)
Fuck all the other shit (Fuck all the other shit)
I fuck me another bitch (I had to go do it)
I had to go do it (I had to go do it)
I had to go do it (I had to go do it)

[Verse 1]
Speeding that bike, dividing your lane
Me and my dogs standing tall like Great Dane
I just met up with Alexander Wang
Salamander sandal, fly to Ukraine
You buying the whip and it not in your name
You is so lame, should be ashamed
Gotta bih who go to Florida State
But I swear she wetter than Miami Hurricane
Had to go do it, I had to go stupid
I had to go roofless, I had to go crusing
Two bitches who diss me, I had to throw deuces
My whip be so bad that I had to know Boosie
Yo bitches with me, I had to go toot it
My rim be so big ain't no trying to go boot it
Rolling up the pack, I swear I feel zooted
Passing gas like I had to go pooty
Calvin Klein [?]
Balling Al Horford
Balling Kyle Korver
Blazing like Portland
My bitch 25, I just call her quarter
She just want the stick, call me Harry Potter
Family crossed the border, we ain't ordinary
Vatos in the kitchen, call it culinary
Buy a monster ball with some Halle Berry
Pull out all the camera, call it Tyler Perry

I hopped in the 'vette (I hopped in the 'vette)
I had to go do it (I had to go do it)
I had to go do it (I had to go do it)
Fuck all the other shit (Fuck all the other shit)
I fuck me another bitch (I had to go do it)
I had to go do it (I had to go do it)
I had to go do it (I had to go do it)

[Verse 2]
We stick together like hands when you pray
Shout out to OG's who put me on game
True Religion denim, we not the same
Sipping on venom like we got fangs
Call me Peter Parker, keep Mary Jane
Kap G the truth yeah and it shall remain
Harley Davidson, you know my shit suede
You got biker jeans but them ain't Balmains
I had to go do it, I ran up a check
End up like I'm in honor roll at Georgia Tech
And your failure is something I cannot accept
Man my neck move, by bank move like I'm playing chess
Polo pajamas, I hop on the jet
And I just keep it moving like I got Tourette's
Cafe La Familia, you know the rest
And yeah just like the cereal, keep me some checks
Louis checkerboard, with Melyssa Fords
In the Honda Accord, hopping out the Porsche
Kap G working now, no unemployed
You don't hit it right, she buying sex toys
Back to back to back, rolling up the joints
Walking in my pennys, I ain't talking coins
She give me facetime, I ain't talking droid
Meet me on the southside like I'm Lloyd
