[Hook]
Mexico mamma came from, College Park I came from
The way I be LeBron Jameing these girls I'm from Akron
Migos in the kitchen and they whippin' with the apron
You think they want to be doing that shit?
But shit they got payments

[Verse 1]
Don't come to me I Can't pay your Metro PCS Payment
She pregnant, man damn dog, you didn't use no latex
She be fucking up your bank account call that not practicing safe sex
And your girl, she basic
She fundamental, tryna buy a continental
Fuck a rental, Freddy Krueger the instrumental
My life is ninety percent hoes and ten percent mental
I'm all about that cheese just like Stuart Little
Your money is Stuart Little, Mexican candy, fuck Skittles
Ay, Ay, Ay
I speak dinero, Español, then Inglés, I'm trilingual
My uncle Dino he speaks Spanish real fast, slow down Bobby Valentino
I be getting pesos, rolling up rillos
Aztec in my blood vessels
Mami please don't give me beso, I just want some good cabeza
My migos they drink cerbeza
My mamacitas get more wetter
King me I ain't talking checkers, just a little carleta
Don't really talk to much, Jordans I buy too much
I don't really wear Louis shoes or Prada shoes, they cost too much

[Hook]
Mexico momma came from, College Park I came from
The way I be LeBron Jameing these girls I’m from Akron
Migos in the kitchen and they whippin' with the apron
You think they want to be doing that shit?
But shit they got payments

[Outro]
Migos blowing reefa on tequila
There's more where that came from
Mama cross the border fuck la migra
There's legs where she came from
