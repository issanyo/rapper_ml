[Hook 1]

Come into the southside, you gon need you an itinerary
Mama keepin faith in a migo
Do it B.I.G you see the faith in a migo

[Verse 1]
I got girls in real life who I tell to come over
And my partner keep the mask like every day is October
You ain't pimpin' if you gotta show that you in a Rover
Same migo scoop a bitch in my Toyota Corolla
I'm from the South like Dakota, young migo might fix ya motor
Young migo sippin' Coronas, I keep them bands like a Jonas

Que dios te bendiga, please pray for a migo

[Verse 2]
I'm straight from Atlanta where we pour dirty Sprite
Man they killin' all our people man it's time to unite
See I used to be a baller now I'm killin' these mics
Know some robbers who run with the jewels like Killer Mike
If you go to Mexico they got connects like Wi-Fi
In my city they'll leave your shirt lookin' tie dyed
Make the top disappear like magic, tada
Call me Carmelo, keep a 7 like I'm LaLa
Migo stay ballin', yeah I used to rock the Dadas
Same bitches used to diss me, now they call me Dada
My watch match my Jeremy Scotts, yeah migo time flies
You can't walk a day up in my shoes, these my size
Mama whippin' up tamales, yeah with the masa
Wasn't with me from the bottom, I don't owe you nada
Chevy so tall I need a ladder just to climb out
Like I'm jumping off a cliff every time I hop out
Honda got the Lamborghini doors when they pop out
I ain't tryna take the pout route, just the pot route
R's on my pockets, yeah you know I bring the rocks out
Pink polos like I'm Kanye, College Dropout
Ain't nothin' changed, I been like this since elementary
The lines that I'm spittin' just like poetry, you know a G
Tameka, Tia, and Alina, I know that they mad at me
My bitch so bad I cut off all my sides, Mr. T

[Hook 3]
I got enemies, got a lotta enemies
Shorty how i'm feeling, mix the cola with the hennnessey
Fuck border patrol, i swear they tryna get rid of me
Kickin shit like FIFA, throw my flag up like a penalty
