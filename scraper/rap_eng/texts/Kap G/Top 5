[Intro: Kap G]
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Chorus: Kap G]
Ran me up a check, I used have nothin'
She gon' come and suck me 'til I'm numb
Good brain like she student of the month
She say that that money make her cum
Ooh, she drop dead gorgeous
Crop top Porsches, drop top Forgis
Tryna dodge police, top five gorgeous
Icebox stonies, yeah I got it on me, mmh

[Verse 1: Kap G]
Yeah from rags to riches, met the baddest bitches
Say they best friends and I had 'em kissin', I like nasty women
We got percies if you want that, she on that
If she bad you know I want that, but I can't raw that, mmh (no)
Don't assume that I'm your boo, mmh
Baby lose the attitude, mmh
I refuse to be a fool, mmh (ayy)
Thought we was cool, what's up with you, mmh (uh-uh)
Yeah you a hottie, but I know you thottie, mmh (I do)
Might throw a party, but you not invited, mmh (your crew)
Look at my army, swear it look like Follies, mmh (they too lit)
That thang poppin', swear it's like hydraulics, mmh (Kap G)

[Chorus: Kap G]
Ran me up a check, I used have nothin'
She gon' come and suck me 'til I'm numb
Good brain like she student of the month
She say that that money make her cum
Ooh, she drop dead gorgeous
Crop top Porsches, drop top Forgis
Tryna dodge police, top five gorgeous (what)
Icebox stonies, yeah I got it on me, mmh

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Walk down on it, uh, yeah

Pop out with that thirty, hold on, uh, fuck a fed homie

[Chorus: Kap G]
Ran me up a check, I used have nothin'
She gon' come and suck me 'til I'm numb
Good brain like she student of the month
She say that that money make her cum
Ooh, she drop dead gorgeous
Crop top Porsches, drop top Forgis
Tryna dodge police, top five gorgeous
Icebox stonies, yeah I got it on me, mmh
