[Verse 1: Nechie]
Knock knock on my door
I got bales for the low yeah I get it
Then I flip it bout' to run me up a ticket
Got them bales in the Civic riding down 85
Heading down to the trenches
Bout' to pick up chickens
I don't trust these bitches
Make you bitches wash my dishes
Sucker boy you trippin
I'll have your ass missing
Diamonds got me glistening
Looking like a million
I can fuck that silly bitch you kissing
I be up I be up late trying to get it
Stack it to the ceiling boy I'm on my mission
Make that money flip take a trip
Trying to double up
Hold that money tight
It's my life I can't fumble it (You buggin' bitch)

Knock knock on the door
Could it be your hoe
Could it be popo
I'm blowin on some smoke

I'm lost gorilla zoe
I order me some shrimp yeah to go Papadeaux
I be up like the vampires on twilight
Got Louis V shades they improving my eyesight
But still keep some shades like i am cock-eyed
These days the feds will tap into your wifi
Told Nechie stop riding with the chickens like popeyes (Crowing)
She can't be my baby no goo goo gah gah
Uh I be up I be up I be up
You be on Instagram, Twitter, buying all of your followers
Sorry I'm balling sir
Lewinsky like Monica
I make it light up like candles no Hanukkah
Her name Veronica
But I call her "Whatcha-ma-callika"
Wrist on froze Antarctica
