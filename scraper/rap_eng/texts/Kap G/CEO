[Intro: Kap G]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kap G]
We came from nothin', can't tell me nothin'
Might smoke me a onion, feel like I'm in London
They used to be frontin', now we do no lovin'
Ooh, I want her cousin, I call her my pumpkin
I'ma blow smoke in they face, see, look at my diamonds they HD
Nigga be buyin' these RAF Piece, nigga, got signed by KP
And a nigga only was 18, then I met Pharrell, he the Bape king
Heard they puttin' on just for ratings, I'm a CEO in the makin'

[Verse 1: Kap G]
I'm a CEO in the makin'
They don't really want me to make it
Fuck that shit, I'ma take it
In high school, I wore Asics
Then I brought it back to new New Balance
I wear them in 2010
Make a nigga crank that pool palace
Know my niggas come out with that FFN
Kick the door down 'cause they gon' let me in
Treat my partners like brothers, I don't got no friends
I been swimmin' with sharks and I don't got no fins
If you knew where I came from, I'm not with the game
You gotta watch out for your enemies
Even your friends be your frenemies
Fuck all that cappin', you 'posed to be kin to me
Fuck all that sad shit, I don't show no sympathy
Fuck a color, I just wanna get green
Get the profits, split it up with the team
Swear that's why I had to roll up my jeans
I'm a rapper slash actor, might be on your screen
They must not know where I came from
Sacrifices, had to make some
Only eat with the ones who were with me before I had shit
Dare you to say somethin', these be my day ones

[Chorus: Kap G]
We came from nothin', can't tell me nothin'
Might smoke me a onion, feel like I'm in London
They used to be frontin', now we do no lovin'
Ooh, I want her cousin, I call her my pumpkin
I'ma blow smoke in they faces, look at my diamonds they HD
Nigga be buyin' these rupees, nigga, got signed by KP
And a nigga only was 18, then I met Pharrell, he the Bape king
Heard they puttin' on just for ratings, I'm a CEO in the makin'

[Verse 2: Kap G & Kapfe]
Swear they only see the shine
But they don't never see the grind
Before these Louis V designs
I was slangin' rhymes like they lines
Pull up on that bitch and hit from behind
Told my partners, we gon' see better times
How the hell we gon' get left behind?
We upper echelon, we gon' get rich or die tryin'
Change up my line
Naw fool
Hol' up, I'm tryna wet her food
Daddy got locked by them cops
Man, he stood on that block, he was sellin' that dog food
Fuck what them niggas gon' call you
Broke is what they never call you
Once car for one of my niggas
Man, best believe all of them bitches gon' fall through
N-n-n-n-n-n-naw fool, these niggas sound like some house shoes
I just be drippin' that Ragu, you cannot cuff me like the cops do
And I'ma reply like a boss too
And I answer all like a boss too
I just wanna buy my own house, fool
And I'ma just trap out the house, fool, you dig? Fuck, I can't hit a wave
Y'all call them cops, they pigs
Put this shit all in a blunt
Y'all smokin' cigs, that ain't it
Dreams on big, blunt on big
Bad bitch with me but she ain't shit

[Chorus: Kap G]
We came from nothin', can't tell me nothin'
Might smoke me a onion, feel like I'm in London
They used to be frontin', now we do no lovin'
Ooh, I want her cousin, I call her my pumpkin
I'ma blow smoke in they faces, look at my diamonds they HD
Nigga be buyin' these rupees, nigga, got signed by KP
And a nigga only was 18, then I met Pharrell, he the Bape king
Heard they puttin' on just for ratings, I'm a CEO in the makin'
