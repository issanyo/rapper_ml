Nacho, nachos extra queso
I'm stackin' it like Legos, and if it's 'bout them pesos
We go Eddie Guerrero, We go Eddie Guerrero
I'm stackin' it like Legos, and if it's 'bout them pesos
We go Eddie Guerrero, We go Eddie Guerrero

[Verse 1]
Ooh kill 'em like Terio
My mamacita come from Mexico
My tank on E, but my gas never low
Big blunts full of texico
She a Florida state seminal
"Que Pasa Homes?" to the West Coast
I don't love [?] in the [?]
I run this shit, Nike Presto's
I told her "shake it like a red nose"
And I'mma beat it like Canelo
I pray to Dios I'm never seeing broke, I'm never seeing broke

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Shout out my primo down in Buford, off Coronas I maneuver
I'm divin' in yo girl like scuba
My family made it from the sewer, I'm from Cali Park like Luda
And I'm winner not a loser, I keep them bands, I play the tuba
Okay, rollin', rellos, bugs bunny, retros
All blue Camero, my bitch yellow, that's 03 Carmelo
Go to Bermuda, skateboarding in the money, I need some Supras

[Hook]
