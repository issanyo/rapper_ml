[Chorus]
Fuck the stunts, I ain't puttin' on for nobody
If you got nothin', you my partner, then you know I got it
'Fore I came up they act like they ain't know nobody
Now all the sudden say you with me, I don't know 'bout it
What goes around comes around, I ain't worried
Me and my rounds we was down but it was worth it
See I won't drown, I swim up to the surface
If you want a round we were down, and you nervous

[Verse 1]
I was down made a plan
Swear you wouldn't understand
My partner serving up the grams
All we needed was a chance
A lot of shit hit the fan
We ain't fold, no exam
You ain't roll with your mans
I might throw your advance
I know they feel it, I'm one of the realest
How could I not feel like the man?
I know they jealous but it ain't no pressure
Man I'ma just keep it a gram
Soon as I met her she wanted to settle
But how when you fucked on my mans?
I'ma go get it, yeah I will not let up
Yeah I want the matte black Lamb
I put my last into this shit, ain't for everybody
Ayy this that capping, is this enough for everybody?
Ayy this that gas, listen, stuff it up with poison ivy
It took some ambition, 'bout to get the frozen timepiece

[Chorus]
Fuck the stunts, I ain't puttin' on for nobody
If you got nothin', you my partner, then you know I got it
'Fore I came up they act like they ain't know nobody
Now all the sudden say you with me, I don't know 'bout it
What goes around comes around, I ain't worried
Me and my rounds we was down but it was worth it
See I won't drown, I swim up to the surface
If you want a round we were down, and you nervous

[Verse 2]
I'm not like them does, I cannot follow your rules, yeah
Surround myself 'round real, the OG be droppin' them jewels, yeah
Boy you better quit that lyin', I know you ain't that dude, yeah
Been in the ring with lions, only came out with a bruise, yeah
I done been played, I done been crossed, but I make 'me feel it
Fuck what you sayin', I'm one of the realest
I got some partners who turn into villians
I took some losses, do you know that feeling?
Been around bosses who handle they business
That's why when we talking it's none of they business
Survive in the jungle, I call it the trenches, yeah
I cannot switch up if I wanted to
Some say it turn you to a monster, that what money do
That shit we running through, we never hung with you
Give me a month or two, we double up like running shoe

[Chorus]
Fuck the stunts, I ain't puttin' on for nobody
If you got nothin', you my partner, then you know I got it
'Fore I came up they act like they ain't know nobody
Now all the sudden say you with me, I don't know 'bout it
What goes around comes around, I ain't worried
Me and my rounds we was down but it was worth it
See I won't drown, I swim up to the surface
If you want a round we were down, and you nervous
