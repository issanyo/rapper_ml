[Chorus]
I got a question for the president
We been workin'
Where the hell you been?
Hol' up, you better think again
What's a day without a Mexican?
Hey oh
Mi gente bailando, mi gente gritando
Like hey oh
What's a day without a Mexican?
Hey oh
Seguimos bailando, seguimos bailando
Like hey oh
What's a day without a Mexican?

[Verse 1]
I got people in my family got no papers
Posted at the Home Depot searchin' for some labor
Taco Tuesdays, yeah dawg you can thank us
Pops workin' Ruby Tuesdays
They ain't pay much
We ain't goin' back to broke, like I'm a banker
It could be 6 below, let's get the paper
Got a bit' from Sinaloa
That wear no make up
She just want to get to know me for the paper
You know when the heat on, we gon' be on
Riding with no AC on in a Nissan
There's some things we don't agree on
We want freedom
Can't treat me like a peon, king like Leon (king like Leon)

[Chorus]
I got a question for the president
We been workin'
Where the hell you been?
Hol' up, you better think again
What's a day without a Mexican?
Hey oh
Mi gente bailando, mi gente gritando
Like hey oh
What's a day without a Mexican?
Hey oh
Seguimos bailando, seguimos bailando
Like hey oh
What's a day without a Mexican?

[Verse 2]
Send the money to family yo when they cash
Probably made the crib where you sleep at
It's more than us trappin' and bringin' weed back
CEO dreams workin' on key pad
See I been away
They label us as renegades
Let 'em imitate
It's okay if you afraid
Yeah it's better days
Life ain't always lemonade
But there's many ways
To put food on your dinner plate
We ain't all big ballers, wit big commas
See I know we work harder, let's work smarter
We could all flip dollars a bit taller
Just a lil' bit farther
We on top, yeah

[Chorus]
I got a question for the president
We been workin'
Where the hell you been?
Hol' up, you better think again
What's a day without a Mexican?
Hey oh
Mi gente bailando, mi gente gritando
Like hey oh
What's a day without a Mexican?
Hey oh
Seguimos bailando, seguimos bailando
Like hey oh
What's a day without a Mexican?

[Bridge]
Drinkin' horchata
My diamonds bachata
Do it for my mama
I do it for my papa
Yeah they risk dollars
You can be a doctor
Jumpin' down your chopper
Listen to my offer
Drinkin' horchata
My diamonds bachata
Do it for my mama
I do it for my papa
Yeah they risk dollars
You can be a doctor
Jumpin' down your chopper
Listen to my offer

[Chorus]
I got a question for the president
We been workin'
Where the hell you been?
Hol' up, you better think again
What's a day without a Mexican?
Hey oh
Mi gente bailando, mi gente gritando
Like hey oh
What's a day without a Mexican?
Hey oh
Seguimos bailando, seguimos bailando
Like hey oh
What's a day without a Mexican?
