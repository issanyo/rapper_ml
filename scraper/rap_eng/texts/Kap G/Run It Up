[Chorus: Kap G]
Yeah, ayy, uh, yeah
I'ma just run it up, ayy, yeah
Oh you wanna be with us? uh, nah
Guess they heard we up, uh, yeah
I'ma just run it up, ayy, yeah
I'ma just run it up, ayy
I was down, they ain't show me love
Uh, yeah, I'ma just run it up

[Verse 1: Don Ace]
I fucked the bitch and forgot I hit her
I'll catch a body like Brian Nichols
I'm from the 6, I ride with the stick
Fuck the police, bitch I'm riding with 'em
I keep the thirty I'm not throwing bows
All of my niggas strapped up like Gibo
Got a white chick, let her play with her nose
Fuck these lil bitches then we let 'em go
Hit the lil bitch then I'm out of there
Can't hit from the front, hit her from the rear
Light up your block like a chandelier
I'm fly as fuck when I walk in here
If I pull up, I'm snatching her soul
Land the dick right on her face like a mole
These bitches know I'm the shit, no camole
Fucked her now I'm on the block with my bros
You know my niggas they never gon' fold
Got in a situation, never told

[Chorus: Kap G]
Yeah, ayy, uh, yeah
I'ma just run it up, ayy, yeah
Oh you wanna be with us? uh, nah
Guess they heard we up, uh, yeah
I'ma just run it up, ayy, yeah
I'ma just run it up, ayy
I was down, they ain't show me love
Uh, yeah, I'ma just run it up

[Verse 2: Kap G]
Yeah, yeah, they ain't having more drip than us, ayy
Got your bitch in the VIP with us, ayy
Gotta be family just to sit with us, ayy, yeah
I want that Bentley truck (skrrt)
Guess what I got in my cup (drank)
You ain't talkin' money then hush (shh)
And I been the shit no flush (flush)
Remember we used to ride that bus (skrrt)
Now I bet the house on us (for real)
Now they want to count on us (what?)
I just want to count it up (woah)
I just want to count them bucks (racks)
Now everybody poppin' up (what?)
When I don't even rock with 'em

[Chorus: Kap G]
Yeah, ayy, uh, yeah
I'ma just run it up, ayy, yeah
Oh you wanna be with us? uh, nah
Guess they heard we up, uh, yeah
I'ma just run it up, ayy, yeah
I'ma just run it up, ayy
I was down, they ain't show me love
Uh, yeah, I'ma just run it up
Yeah, yeah
