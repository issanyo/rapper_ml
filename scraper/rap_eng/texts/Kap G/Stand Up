[Verse 1: Yung Booke]
Posted up right in the trenches
The OGs was teaching us lessons
They told me get up and go get it
And stack so I get me a milly
No time to lay up with them bitches
Ho [?] caught me no feelings
Ride 'round with lil meek, he the realest
It's a whole lot of cash and a pigeon
My time, it comin' I feel it
Can't play, gotta be 'bout your business
Got war scars all on my back from being backstabbed so fuck being friendly
When I come through I'm in a foreign car with the window clip, you can see me up in it
With the draco and a Glock 40, with an S clip, both of 'em extended

[Chorus: Yung Booke]
Woah woah, word around town
Uno nigga poppin', fuck nigga we got now, ayy
Barrel got potato on it, it won't make a sound
They gon' have to try and find you like Nemo
Try to ride the wave, lil nigga gon' drown
Brr, brr, that's the bird call
Skrt, fishtail swerve off, ayy, yeah
We gotta stand up, ayy
Please don't shoot me officer, I got my hands up, ayy
'Cause the color of our skin they put is in handcuffs, ayy
'Cause the color of our skin they don't understand us, no
Got to stop killing each other, together let's stand up
They throw away evidence, even though everything was caught on camera

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
Let's get it
Real niggas who we are boy
Stand up and applaud for us
Fuck a nerd, we'll drag a screech
Like nails on a chalkboard
Boy you fighting in the wrong war
All of the things we fought for
Prezi Rollie but I'm never voting
Everybody running is the wrong choice
I get the drop on the opps
Never put trust in a cop
Young shooters like early Bad Boy
They run around with the locks
Dreading your days in the kitchen
Seein' how they whip a pot
Old time nigga, Jigga Boo
How you sell that shit back to your block
You a fuckin' sell out nigga

[Chorus: Yung Booke]
Woah woah, word around town
Uno nigga poppin', fuck nigga we got now, ayy
Barrel got potato on it, it won't make a sound
They gon' have to try and find you like Nemo
Try to ride the wave, lil nigga gon' drown
Brr, brr, that's the bird call
Skrt, fishtail swerve off, ayy, yeah
We gotta stand up, ayy
Please don't shoot me officer, I got my hands up, ayy
'Cause the color of our skin they put is in handcuffs, ayy
'Cause the color of our skin they don't understand us, no
Got to stop killing each other, together let's stand up
They throw away evidence, even though everything was caught on camera

[Verse 3: Kap G]
I got on Louis V linens
I see the police in my business
They just gave my homie a sentence
For slangin' that Dennis the Menace
Hands up, don't shoot
Tryna jam us, we cool
Excuse me officer, I'm no fool
I let the OG's drop jewels
I'ma hit Booke, he pull up with Uno
RIP Troupe, he stick to that blue code
I'm in the coupe, that be that two door
I'ma pull up with a hundred Latinos
I got your main bitch at home on my other line
Fuck it, I'm rockin' them Timbs in the summer time
Fuck the police, they be tryna act colorblind
I swear they gon' make me go buy me another nine

[Chorus: Yung Booke]
Woah woah, word around town
Uno nigga poppin', fuck nigga we got now, ayy
Barrel got potato on it, it won't make a sound
They gon' have to try and find you like Nemo
Try to ride the wave, lil nigga gon' drown
Brr, brr, that's the bird call
Skrt, fishtail swerve off, ayy, yeah
We gotta stand up, ayy
Please don't shoot me officer, I got my hands up, ayy
'Cause the color of our skin they put is in handcuffs, ayy
'Cause the color of our skin they don't understand us, no
Got to stop killing each other, together let's stand up
They throw away evidence, even though everything was caught on camera
