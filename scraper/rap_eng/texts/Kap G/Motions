[Intro]
Goin' through the motions
The motions, yeah
Yeah, goin' through the motions
The motions, yeah

[Verse 1]
Lately I been on the road, I'm just tryna go get me a mil (get me a mil)
I just moved outta my mama crib, I want the house on the hills (house on the hills)
Startin' to feel all these side effects, I had to pop me a pill (pop me a pill)
And fuck niggas save all your compliments, where was you before the deal?
I just went and got my Einstein on
Deion Sanders yeah, my prime time on
Ended out here with the bright lights on
Plus it ain't even nighttime dog
It ain't no stoppin' the flow
We was on Washington Road
Yeah, we stayed up in my vernie
Only 10 folks at my shows
That was on 4
What you thought, we weren't gon' turn up?
I'm tryna dodge all the backlash
I'm leanin' just like a bat slap
I want the girl with the back tat
She want a nigga with fat stacks
I had to get off of my mama's damn couch
I know they ain't wanna see me do it
I always wondered how they feel
But that rose beat me to it
That just motivate us

[Chorus]
Runnin' through the motions
Runnin' through the motions
Tell these fuck niggas
Get out they emotions
Motions, runnin' through the motions
I want a stack 'cause you know I'm unstoppable
I made a difference so anything's possible

[Verse 2]
I just a young nigga here with a OG mind frame (OG, OG)
Yeah, had to fall back from that bitch she was playin' them mind games (mind games)
Swear that they countin' me out, I'm feelin' like Bron James (Bron, Bron, Bron)
And I'm not goin' back and forth, even when the time change
And I ain't gotta flood like I bought the Rollie
Niggas swear they know me
They gon' get the .40 (brrrr)
I need a bad bitch, call me Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie's
I look in the mirror and I'm my own opponent
Y'all be actin' like pussy more important
My niggas got work, ain't no one employ me
You wanna shot me, come make an appointment
I used to get no reply when I text
A migo the plug, I ain't talkin' 'bout tesla
Skatin' on the track like I'm Ryan Sheckler
My partners some savages, they rock the chokers
I be in the trap, spot like a leopard
We just roll up, get outta that pressure
We were reppin', and my bro, I invest her
I'ma wake 'em up, just like a stresser

[Chorus]
Runnin' through the motions
Runnin' through the motions
Tell these fuck niggas
Get out they emotions
Motions, runnin' through the motions
I want a stack 'cause you know I'm unstoppable
I made a difference so anything's possible

[Outro]
Anything's possible
Anything's possible
Anything's possible
I made a difference so anything's possible
