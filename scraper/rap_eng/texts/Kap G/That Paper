I love that paper, I love that paper
I love that paper, I love that paper (te amo)
Get em' in by the boatload, you know I can't fuck with a broke hoe
'Cause I love that paper
I love that paper, I love that paper

[Verse 1]
I love that paper, I love that paper
I'm getting this paper (dinero)
And if it ain't money then we're not related, there's no conversation
I just keep it pimpin', girl why is you trippin'?
That's just in my nature
Got my barber in Cali, he got LA Clippers, he give me a shape up
If this ain't no migo shit, you don't know nothing about it
My weed is so loud and your shit is so quiet, your pockets on diet
I've been tryna get money, I've been rollin' these blunts, I don't worry bout no broke hoes
Girl you're gettin' on my nerves, I can't buy you no Louie, that's a motherfuckin' no-no
Migos bring em' in through the boatloads
This is for all of them sellin' cocos
Got a bad bitch named Coco, can't put a ring on it, I ain't frodo
And whenever we see the popos, hit the backdoor, here the 4-4
Oh no, and I got dope boys, Cortez, you know, just like cholos

[Hook]
I love that paper, I love that paper
I love that paper, I love that paper (te amo)
Get em' in by the boatload, you know I can't fuck with a broke hoe
'Cause I love that paper
I love that paper, I love that paper

[Verse 2]
Go get your weight up, don't owe you no favors
Don't like me, then sue me
Got powerful lawyers just like great debaters
Put the money on the table, I'm the truth not a phantom
Tim Tebow, my cowboy boots, yes and they from Florida Gators
I'm kickin' I'm kickin' that flava, I'm kickin' that flavor
Money on my mind, I don't got time to be a conversator
I've been rollin' these blunts
I've been tryna get money, tryna get my cake up
And I'm rollin' with my dawgs
Yeah I'm rolling with my wolves, like Twilight, Jacob
Straight up, pay up, and my bitch got on no makeup
And I gotta act down with her face up, put her in the hip like a pager, straight up, straight up
I don't play no games, no Sega
Gotta kick her out when she wake up
Say "Kap G but te amo"
I don't need no bull no Chicago, adios
