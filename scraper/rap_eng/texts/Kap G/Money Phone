[Intro]
Squat made the beat, Go Grizz

[Chorus]
Yeah
Getting money while I'm on the phone (yeah)
I count money when I'm all alone (yeah)
I throw money when she on that pole (yeah)
I got groupies when I'm on the road
I got, I got, benji's on me
I got, I got women wantin' me
I got, I got, benji's on me
I got , I got women wantin' me

[Verse 1]
I woke up feelin' like pablo
I'm at magic she on all fours
I do this shit with my eyes closed
If you ain't livin' what your grindin' for?
I got , I got bitches wanting me
I can't, I can't keep 'em off me
This shit, this shit so beyond me (this shit so beyond me)
If you ain't dead why don't we unload 'em? (unload 'em)
Baseball blunts how we roll 'em (rolled 'em)
Everybody acting like we owed 'em
Khloe Kardashian, Lamar Odom

[Chorus]
Yeah
Getting money while I'm on the phone (yeah)
I count money when I'm all alone (yeah)
I throw money when she on that pole (yeah)
I got groupies when I'm on the road
I got, I got, benji's on me
I got, I got women wantin' me
I got, I got, benji's on me
I got , I got women wantin' me

[Verse 2]
Come ride with me in the fast lane (woo)
No free parking this ain't valet (valet)
She pullin' up, she had a bad day (bad day, woo)
Get on those tippy toes like ballet(ballet)
Damn my old bitch you can have that (have that)
And remember 06', had that hatchback (skrt)
Yeah was feeling all alone now I'm past that (I'm past that)
Gettin' money on the phone through the cash app (woo)
Fuck it make it double up
Had to get my money up
Told my team let's run it up
We fair play no runners up
Your bitch fell in love with us
Told your bitch come fuck with us
Welcome to the money club

[Chorus]
Yeah
Getting money while I'm on the phone (yeah)
I count money when I'm all alone (yeah)
I throw money when she on that pole (yeah)
I got groupies when I'm on the road
I got, I got, benji's on me
I got, I got women wantin' me
I got, I got, benji's on me
I got , I got women wantin' me
