[Verse 1: Dusty McFly]
Look, look
About to roll up some of this loud kush and smoke my stress away
Just forget about that little bag I fucked up yesterday
Took this bad bitch out of town and I blew like seven "K"
I didn't even have to do it I was going to fuck her anyway
But like my nigga slick said Fleez don't worry you just blessed her
Thats what rich niggas do and plus she gon' love you forever
So consider it a deed you showed her some different things
Plus sold all of them good seeds so them blessings you fin' to reap
Everyday I'm waking up I thank the lord for another day
Could've been up in a cell or up in the grave
Told my momma we gon' be straight
Call all my niggas told them they some money on the way

[Chorus: Dusty McFly]
I CAN'T COMPLAIN
I CAN'T COMPLAIN
My life good... I CAN'T COMPLAIN
I CAN'T COMPLAIN
I CAN'T COMPLAIN
Got some money on the floor so I CAN'T COMPLAIN

[Verse 2: Kap G]
