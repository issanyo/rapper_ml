[Chorus: Kap G]
You see the doors, Aventador
Draped in Dior, no Michael Kors
This shit ain't forced, need to be endorsed
Let [?], she might be yours, yeah
Made myself into a boss, the choice is yours
Know they all gon' hate it when I make the Forbes
You can see the blood sweat and tears comin' out my pores
Shit could've been worse, show no remorse

[Verse 1: Kap G]
I got 'em all big mad, look at them diamonds dance
Drip coming in from France, [?] too advanced
I met the bitch on the Gram, she gotta put up the cam, yeah
We gettin' too much bands, I had to put on my mans, yeah
And I'm still counting, I need an accountant
My neck water fountain, never got an allowance
I let the cash talk for me, I want the bag, charge a fee
Taking my class, watch me teach
I'm shopping at Saks twice a week
Yeah, y'all ain't official
I want a friend, I want a sister
If she a ten I just might miss her
And she my rider, she holding the pistol
I cannot lie, my neck is a blizzard
My money six-five, I play with the Clippers
My future look bright, I gotta get it
I'm feelin' like Skippa, I gotta flip it

[Chorus: Kap G]
You see the doors, Aventador
Draped in Dior, no Michael Kors
This shit ain't forced, need to be endorsed
Let [?], she might be yours, yeah
Made myself into a boss, the choice is yours
Know they all gon' hate it when I make the Forbes
You can see the blood sweat and tears comin' out my pores
Shit could've been worse, show no remorse

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
Shit could've been worse
I bought a Porsche then bought her a purse
They say I'm too real so I'm down to earth
I'm never second 'cause I come in first
She get dab, I did it first
I can be all of the Beatles, Wraith me
I came straight from a Regal
A hundred piece land, stay fly like a seagull
The Glock got a red dot, you'll think you had measles
The choice is yours
You could be rich or you could be broke
You could be with me, you could be against me
And if you a hater that means you a joke
I mean the choice is yours
Me and Kap G real soon on the Forbes
I bought a crib right on the golf course
We call it Nawf, you call it North
Whole rack full of shoes, draped down Jimmy Choos
Give her the blues if she choose
I like 'em better by twos
I can't lose, only for money I move
She say that I get it wetter
Rubber bands on the cheddar
She gon' act up if you let her
I'ma kill 'em when I catch 'em
I'm having paper like letters, Flippa

[Chorus: Kap G]
You see the doors, Aventador
Draped in Dior, no Michael Kors
This shit ain't forced, need to be endorsed
Let [?], she might be yours, yeah
Made myself into a boss, the choice is yours
Know they all gon' hate it when I make the Forbes
You can see the blood sweat and tears comin' out my pores
Shit could've been worse, show no remorse
