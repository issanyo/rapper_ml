[Chorus: Skinnyfromthe9]
Diamonds wet, I'm drippin', in a jet, five bitches
That's your bitch, said I hit it, way too lit to fight niggas
Way too lit to fight, you my bitch, I lied
Do that shit I like, way too rich, I fly
Diamonds wet, I'm drippin', in a jet, five bitches
That's your bitch, said I hit it, way too lit to fight niggas
Way too lit to fight, you my bitch, I lied
Do that shit I like, way too rich, I fly

[Verse 1: Kap G]
They tryna kill my vibe
Can't let 'em kill my vibe
Pull up in that 'Vette, all white
But this ain't Pimp My Ride
I had to roll the dice
I had to up my price
I used to stay up all night
Now I might fuck your wife
Ever since I got them bands, they wanna be my friend
I gotta pull up my pants, I walk around with a ten
No light on the cam when that water hit
I don't need no flag, this a lot of drip
Diamonds wet, I'm drippin'
Please respect my pimpin'
Lot of Tech I'm sippin'
Gotta check my vision
And I ain't stressed, I'm livin'
We got TEC's like Pippen
You so stressed 'bout women
Tell him get up out his feelings

[Chorus: Skinnyfromthe9]
Diamonds wet, I'm drippin', in a jet, five bitches
That's your bitch, said I hit it, way too lit to fight niggas
Way too lit to fight, you my bitch, I lied
Do that shit I like, way too rich, I fly
Diamonds wet, I'm drippin', in a jet, five bitches
That's your bitch, said I hit it, way too lit to fight niggas
Way too lit to fight, you my bitch, I lied
Do that shit I like, way too rich, I fly

[Verse 2: Skinnyfromthe9]
Look at the wrist, hah
I send your bitch, hah
I'ma go hit, yeah
She wanna ride on my dick
I want the brain
So when you go down, just make sure you spit, ah
She wanna rub on my neck
'Cause I got them diamonds, you know that they wet
Way too rich to fight
I like different bitches, I don't have no type
Black or white
Diamonds drippin', yeah, you know they cold as ice
My pockets on overbite
You look hurt, boy, get your life
If I go and text your bitch
She might not come home tonight
I'ma go break her back
She wanna fuck 'cause I got a check
She throw that ass back, yeah
And I'ma go rub on her breasts, uh
We sip Ciroc on the boat
I'ma go fuck on her throat
She wanna hang like a rope
But I cut her off, 'cause that bitch annoying
And I want the dough, uh
Sippin' the lean like a smoothie
All of these bitches is choosey
I got her in a Jacuzzi
She want me to take my clothes off
But bitch I'm wearin' Gucci

[Chorus: Skinnyfromthe9]
Diamonds wet, I'm drippin', in a jet, five bitches
That's your bitch, said I hit it, way too lit to fight niggas
Way too lit to fight, you my bitch, I lied
Do that shit I like, way too rich, I fly
Diamonds wet, I'm drippin', in a jet, five bitches
That's your bitch, said I hit it, way too lit to fight niggas
Way too lit to fight, you my bitch, I lied
Do that shit I like, way too rich, I fly
