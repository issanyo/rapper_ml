[Chorus]
Got her geekin' for the weekend
Got her geekin' for the weekend
I got her freakin' for the weekend
Throw a pool party, throw her off the deep end
Got her geekin', I got that lil' bitch geekin'
I got her freakin', I got that lil' bitch freakin'
Got her geekin' for the weekend
Got her geekin' for the weekend

[Verse 1]
I got 'em kissin', two video vixens
She want attention, she touchin' on my dick print
I got a mixed bitch, she pulled up with her big friend
Her daddy king pin, he can get the bricks in
I throw a party at the mansion like it's Run's house
When I'm in Benihana's, gotta get that Yum Sauce
She got that dome sauce, now take your Uggs off
Now take your bun off, now get me unsoft

[Chorus]
Got her geekin' for the weekend
Got her geekin' for the weekend
I got her freakin' for the weekend
Throw a pool party, throw her off the deep end
Got her geekin', I got that lil' bitch geekin'
I got her freakin', I got that lil' bitch freakin'
Got her geekin' for the weekend
Got her geekin' for the weekend

[Verse 2]
Hola, nice to meet you
Yeah, you know they call me, "Take Your Bitch"
And I'm big ball cappin' and it's R.I.P. to Bankroll Fresh
Ain't no wastin' time with anythin' I do, I make a check
Ain't no wastin' time, I think she wanna pop the Percocet
I think she geekin', yeah, she liked my recent
Yeah, I send a DM, maybe we can be friends
She from Cleveland, her cousin from Four Seasons
I think she cheatin', TLC, she creepin'

[Chorus]
Got her geekin' for the weekend
Got her geekin' for the weekend
I got her freakin' for the weekend
Throw a pool party, throw her off the deep end
Got her geekin', I got that lil' bitch geekin'
I got her freakin', I got that lil' bitch freakin'
Got her geekin' for the weekend
Got her geekin' for the weekend
