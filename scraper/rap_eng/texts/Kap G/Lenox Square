[Intro]
Oogie Mane killed it
I'm workin' on dyin'

[Chorus: Kap G & Chef Cook It Up]
I just love Lenox Square
YSL (Ysl slatt!), Damier,(Damier!)
I'm fresh as hell(fresh as hell), double G's(Gucci)
On every pair(Gucci)
Hermes, I'm high as hell
I just love Lenox Square
Fendi belt, Red bottoms, watch my step
Drip to death (drip to death)
It ain't for sale(it ain't for sale)
Don't need no stylist, I dress myself

[Verse 1: Kap G]
Kap G always walkin' wit' a bad bitch(bad bitch)
Kap G up in magic throwin' taxes(taxes)
Kap G take your bitch, ooo that's tragic(tragic)
Kap G pullin' up, send your address(your address)
I turn into a villain when the night is young(wooo)
All this [?] spinnin', it's a one of one
I turn into a villain when the night is young(wooo)
Bring the Henny and the Percy's we gon' have some fun(wooo)

Yeah, you know that these pants got flames on it
I might hit the flames just to make it rain on her
Neiman Marcus, shoppin' Alexander Wang on her
You can't tell me who drip harder, put my chain on it

[Chorus: Kap G & Chef Cook It Up]
I just love Lenox Square
YSL (Ysl slatt!), Damier,(Damier!)

Don't need no stylist, I dress myself

[Verse 2: Chef Cook It Up]
Red, lost a red bottom walkin' on a Bitch(Brrr)

I don't give a fuck about them hoes in my VIP
Your boyfriend is a swiper
I'm sittin' on them Louis V diapers
I swear I'm tired of all of these biters
Louis V boots like a rich ass hiker
Raf Simons wit' the Fendi in this bih' (Fendi in that bit')
I love all the pretty women in this bih' (pretty women in this bit')
Diamond's dancin' like they twerkin' in this bih' (twerk, twerk)
They just had me high, I gave my forty in this bit'

[Chorus: Kap G & Chef Cook It Up]
