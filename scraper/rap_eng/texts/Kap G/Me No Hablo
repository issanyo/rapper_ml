Verse 1: Kap G
I do it this for all my illegals
You know King Lil G he be tatted like migos
Im stacking pan bimbo
Im sorry, Im sorry
Ain't none of you can get no slides like a kimbo
My vato got bells like jingle
I'm blowin on mango, I'm rollin extendos
I'm foggin the windows, I'm out in the West Coast
Im stackin the bisco
Im dancin on the bitch like i do disco

And im gettin money like gringos
Boutta go to Don Francisco
Got a mamacita, yea she single and she call me bae like San Francisco
Line in my head like cisco
I might pull up with ten hoes
Rule number 1 dont save these hoes not even on a domingo
You ain't talking money me no hablo
Eat cheetos de la diablo
Young Johnny Bravo
King Lil G thats my vato
See i go to East LA, King Tacos
Go to Mexico del Chapo
Go to Mexico del campos
Im a big dog you a gato

Verse 2: King Lil G
I flew to Atlanta and got me a cup
A phone call to Kap and i got me some blunts
King in the building and im back now
Going through the city and im feeling kinda trapped out, trapped out
Hittin up hoes on the internet
Talkin bout I know you bitches feelin it
Gun in my lap and one in the chamber
Reppin the A to the city of Angels
Show me who the fuck is boss
Show me who the fuck it is we puttin in a coffin
Often mobbin, brand new Chucks and i got em from Slauson, Slauson
Im the boy that be reppin the hood
The nine in the tech in the hood
You run when we mention the crooks
Get shot and get left in the hood
I smoke the expensivest kush

They dont really wanna see me blow up
Mad cuz yo ex bitch on the run up
And i dont even wanna fuck that bitch
I dont understand why you trust that bitch
You the type to go wife hoes up
Knowing damn well that the bitches give you no love
Then they turn into groupies when I blow up
And their best friend’s chillin with my soldier

Verse 3: Kap G
They ain't talkin money dont approach them
Been gettin money since when I had a low cut
Big bread coca, do it for the culure
Keep the club jumpin, makin bitch do toe touch
Tell me what’s the dealio, I dunno why they hate me
Probably because Kap G all up in ya hoe
We might make a video, upload it on Vimeo
Me and King Lil G blowin O’s, Cheerios
Here we go

First of all, Imma put my city on, money gettin really long
Tryin to stack a billion
Migo play his cards right, i ain't talkin Digimon, die real flow
Now these niggas gettin shitted on
Atlanta fuck this video on
Corona got me really gone
Taco put the chile on
Im with these hoes
Kap G got similes, metaphors and idioms
They dont wanna let me on Fresh Prince
Yea you can call me Mr William
When they let us in the reels all over the radio
People say I made it yo
Nah I ain't made it home
Do it for the soldiers that ain't make it home
Do it out here prop, trap and raggaeton
Sippin on, I be on, ballin on a comma long
Baby girl leave me alone
Imma put my people on
Wonder they gone know me homes’
We gon bring the trophy home
They should brace their knees alone
Imma say “Que pasa homes” ayy
Kap G!

Chorus: Kap G
Migo we takin it all
Migo we takin it all
They wanna see us fall
They wanna see us fall
You ain't talkin money me no hablo
You ain't talkin money me no hablo
I been rollin up so my eyes low
I been rollin up so my eyes low

Migo we takin it all
Migo we takin it all
They wanna see us fall
They wanna see us fall
You ain't talkin money me no hablo
You ain't talkin money me no hablo
I been rollin up so my eyes low
I been rollin up so my eyes low
