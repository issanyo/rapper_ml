Think you having fun with me, well what you think 'bout havin' two?"
Huh, I say "Hold up

But from where I'm sittin' girl that sound like a m√©nage"
She grabbed the phone and said "Can I call Chanel here?"
You woulda thought that I was Drake

I was solo, needed foster, uh
Draped in polo and Lacoste

You could say that I'm the hardest, yeah
Grew up listening to 'Ye to Wayne to Shawn Carter
I'ma aim for it to make it rain harder

It was days I coulda make martyr
Thank God I lived a day longer
Worked for money way longer

[Verse 3: Kamaiyah]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
You don't know who I am, but I'm a fuckin' star
And I don't come out, unless I bring a entourage
I being out on the scene then stuntin' hard
Lifestyles of the rich, this ain't no mirage
Like Nicki Minaj said, I don't want no frauds
East coast, west coast, we the coldest broads
You hoes being in the field gettin' no rewards
You want real shit? I'm real, this ain't no facade
Now I ain't talkin' slick, I don't know these broads
They got they hands out, shit, I don't owe these broads
Rip these niggas when we get 'em, we don't own these dogs
We just sex some and next them, we ownin' all
Called me up the next morning and my phone was off
It's the hot girl, baby, I been known to floss
Goin' hard on these fellas 'cause these hoes is soft
Standin' under my umbrella, you'll be coldin' off
The hot girl by nature with the coldest heart
Say my name, say my name, I don't notice y'all
Diamond bezel on my wrist with the golden charm
And the money is all we get, it's what we focused on
We got beef in the streets, y'all just funkin' songs
Y'all don't really want problems when that funk is on
'Cause if it goes down it goes down, I throw these palms
I slap a chick real quick 'til she knows she's wrong
Goin' up against me, that's a hopeless cause
You's a bum ass bitch, you's a homeless broad
In your homeless ass panties and your homeless bra
I put your ass on wax, these hoes is frauds
Fuck your bum ass hustle and your stolen cars
Yo' ass is full of shit like your colons are
I don't like you chicks, so I'm goin' off
A newcomer in the game with the coldest start
Now what the fuck y'all gon' do, 'cause I'm on ya next
Like I'm standin' backstage, I'm on an X
You can say what you want, but I pose a threat
When you listening to this, I know you sweat
Kickin' rhymes every line that you won't forget
I buy my own champagne and my own baguettes
This the new school style, we ownin' fresh
Like a teacher at a school, I been known to test
And Big Money be the team I been known to rep
I got a nice round ass for my throne to rest
A lot of stamina, I can have the longest sex
And your man, he been a freak, he give the longest neck
Y'all be arguing this shit when I'm at home in bed
Readin' a book, lounging, the grown finesse
The queen is all well, supreme the cartel
Big Money be the team that get cream and we all sell
Just in case y'all forgot, I'm a motherfuckin' blow this
Just a little something to let y'all motherfuckers know, uh
