Heard them hatin' 'cause them boys on the come up
Stay with them shooters, They stay with them drummers

Them dudes to my left, yeah I call them my brothers
In love with my money, I could never love her
Hit her on a Monday, gotta use a rubber
I keep them shirts with the ape, Bape
Told my dog put down the AK
