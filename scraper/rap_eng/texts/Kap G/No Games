[Chorus: Herr]
I ain't here to play with these bitches, yeah
I ain't droppin' names on these bitches
Big pounds, big whippin', playin' games with these bitches, yeah
They know my name, I'm the shit, yeah
They know my name, I'm the shit
Big whip, big
Not a name with the shit, yeah, yeah
Ain't playin' games with these bitches, yeah
Ain't playin' games with these bitches

[Verse 1: Chefcookitup]
I'm with my gang in the trenches
We smoking Backwoods and sippin'
I'm in the ten, pay attention
These niggas trippin' off a mention
Art, I don't even know where I'm goin'
Georgia got me snowin', 'cause the whole thing we pourin'
Smoke my mid brand storm
I put my phone in airplane mode because you know I'm goin'
I put my phone in airplane mode 'cause bitch you so annoying
I am not the same as these niggas
I don't play no games with these niggas
Forty got the bang for you niggas
I'm taxing whole plain on you niggas

[Chorus: Herr]
I ain't here to play with these bitches, yeah
I ain't droppin' names on these bitches
Big pounds, big whippin', playin' games with these bitches, yeah
They know my name, I'm the shit, yeah
They know my name, I'm the shit
Big whip, big
Not a name with the shit, yeah, yeah
Ain't playin' games with these bitches, yeah
Ain't playin' games with these bitches

[Verse 2: Kap G]
Yeah, go and make it rain, change the forecast
I swear I was poppin' way before rap
Sleeping with your ho like I'm Snorlax
All of y'all the same, change the format
Ain't got that thing with 'em
My brothers my brothers, we hit the same women
Yeah, these my gang members, you hear the pain in us
We ain't taking no L's, it just ain't in us
We some game winners, let 'em hate with you
I just paint pictures, you can get your issue
Lately I been making moves if it's beneficial
And you ain't no boss if your partners can't eat with you
(Yeah, yeah, Kap G, ooh)

[Chorus: Herr]
I ain't here to play with these bitches, yeah
I ain't droppin' names on these bitches
Big pounds, big whippin', playin' games with these bitches, yeah
They know my name, I'm the shit, yeah
They know my name, I'm the shit
Big whip, big
Not a name with the shit, yeah, yeah
Ain't playin' games with these bitches, yeah
Ain't playin' games with these bitches
