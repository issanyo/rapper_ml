[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
Call that papi
Need that kilo, call that papi

[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
Smooth, got my eyes on the Jake now
Everybody on the ground like a shakedown
Everybody better move out the way now
All these niggas moving drugs upstate now
Too many rats being sharks on that wave now
If everybody's the connect, where's the weight now?
[?] dry, so we looking for a place now
The car's stolen so we looking for a plate now
Push, push that metal, turn that wheel
Torch that [?] when you done
Leave no prints, use your sense
A nigga like me can't be on the run
I thought I taught you better
I hope you save that cheddar
‘Cause when the boys get fed up and the [?] won't let up
And get your wifey to set up and see your man get wet up, like "Ah!"
Then what you gon' do?
Turn yourself in and Catch-22
To be a wanted man, that's a catch-22
But that bullet proof vest will catch 22, like, "Ah!"
It's doubtful
Fly down South, we drought-proof
You been locked up, who housed you?
‘Cause there's really nothing real about you

[Hook: Bodega Bamz]

[Verse 2: Dro Fe]
Look, hold up, these niggas wanna be like me?
They ain't living how I'm living, got a room full of bitches
And they all trying to fuck for free, what they about me?
What they know about us? What they know about us?
Pull up on a hater in a black escalator
Everybody on the ground ‘cause they know I'm fin to bust
Never been a bitch I trust
Never been a player I ain't touch
Fuck twelve, fuck twelve, fuck jail
They gon' have to kill a nigga 'fore they put me back in cuffs
[?] mi gente [?]
[?]
Stacking my lana, flipping Madonna
Dolo mis ceros got commas
Migos, we fucking up commas
Haters we fucking they damas
Quick when I'm squeezing that llama
My people in Cali, they medical farmers
Everybody wanna be like us
Only the cash that I lust
Money counting, count it in a rush

[Verse 3: Kap G]
I just went to New York, pull up in a two-door
Young Kap G, I'm a boss no dude, boy
Take it back to '97, man I'm feeling like young Jay
When he scored 38, with the blue boy
People think they doing us, [?] I need to do more
Running up the pack, I don't even smoke Newport
You done hit 'em all, I ain't ever buy shit unless I had to
Hit the food court, now your money too short
Stripes on me so official, blow the whistle, just like Too $hort
Trying to get a yacht and a mansion with two courts
Trying to get a new porch, I don't even know her like that
Shorty say I'm a [?] like [?]
On the South side like a zoo boy, [?]
[?] boy, you already knew, boy
[?] buying and they stealing, man I'm about to sue, boy
Throwing up the money, like the 'migo got food poisonin'
Kap G, Bodega, bounce boy
You know that I fuck with them town boys
We like back in the day bad boys
And my swag killa, a Cam voice
Ay, make a movie, get the camcorder
We don't roll back, we just fast forward
And my partners posted in the trap, boy
Bagging up the work like a JanSport
