Its Mob Life To The Next Life
Uh Yeah I Gotta Get It

[Verse 1]
Yo All I Know Is Realness
I Pray To God For Forgiveness
Cause I'm Trying To Do Right Son
And I Know One Day I'ma Get Me Some
I Dream Of Nice Girls With The Big Booty
Sometimes They Can Get A Lil Moody
But All I Gotta Do Is Roll A Fat Doobie
And Take Her To The Crib While We Watch A Movie
And Now She Get A Lil Flirty
And Gettin' Flirty
Always Leads To Us Gettin' Dirty
Now She Showing Me That Thong
While She Sing Along To The Words Of My Song
Oh God You Know I Want That
Cause This Life
Is Somethin' That I Never Had
And When It Comes That Day
I'ma Take Aim
And This What I'm Gon' Say

[Chorus]
I Pray To God For Forgiveness
I Swear To God I'm The Realest
We Blowin' Smoke To The Ceilin'
Shorty Wanna Chill One Night
Then I'm Gon' Say, Oh Lord
I Got You Now
I Got You Now
I Got You Now
Yeah, I Got You Now

[Verse 2: Kap G]
And I Got You, I Got You
Yeah I Got You
I Can't Even Lie, Girl I Want You
I Can Be Your Number 1 Person You Talk To
And I Be Feeling Like The Man When I Walk Through
I Know Yo Mama At The Crib
And She Gon' Kill Ya If She Find Out That I'm On You
We Like Love & Basketball
If It Had A Part 2
So Just Open Up Your Window Baby
Like A Drive-Thru
I'm A Slide Thru
Baby What You & Your Ex Had
Man That Shit Fake Like A Cartoon
Baby I'm The Real Shit
Like A Documentary
Yeah That Body Art Girl
Leonardo da Vinci
Drew That On You
Drew That On You
That Dress On You, Look Good
But I Rather See Less Up On You
And She From The Hood
And I Like That
We Can Kick It, Mortal Combat
Girl I Want Your Heart Back
Yeah You Know That, Kap G..

[Chorus]
