[Chorus]
Last year I ain't really had nothin'
This year I made your house in a month
Since a youngin' kept it solid from the jump
I gotta cherish it, I used to have nothin'
Yeah, had to keep faith, came a long way
I'm fuckin' your bae and I'm runnin' away
Got a lot on my plate, gotta make some shape
And it ain't no brakes, yeah

[Verse 1]
[?] it, let's get the M's when I want
Want a Lambo wit' [?] rims when I want
I got fans 'cause I'm on now
But I want them M's in my bank account, yeah, woo
Whatchu gon' do?
I had to clear [?], I had to go crazy
Wanna have my baby now, tryna have my baby
My bitch your old lady, yeah, I don't do no basic, yeah
[?] no love on the fam
Went into the crew, shoppin' 'cause I can now
Michael Jackson, moonwalkin' wit' them bands now
All my boys legit, no more in the trap house, no

[Chorus]
Last year I ain't really had nothin'
This year I made your house in a month
Since a youngin' kept it solid from the jump
I gotta cherish it, I used to have nothin'
Yeah, had to keep faith, came a long way
I'm fuckin' your bae and I'm runnin' away
Got a lot on my plate, gotta make some shape
And it ain't no brakes, yeah

[Verse 2]
I want some more, for sure, for sure(for sure)
I like my money in boatloads, I want a lot more
There's a lotta [?] I don't know but I just lay low(low)
Free my partner [?] 'til they go
Livin' like no ma√±ana
Ladie's your hoe's, she wan' us
I don't need no more drama
[?] it, I want the M's, I gotta reel them in
I need no more friends, I got these Benjamin's
And she bring a friend [?] and we have a [?] (and we have a toast)
I hope out the Benz and I want a friend
I told her come here(yeah I want you ho)
I have my way, I have my way
And I cannot wait, 'til we break the bank(Kap G)

[Chorus]
Last year I ain't really had nothin'
This year I made your house in a month
Since a youngin' kept it solid from the jump
I gotta cherish it, I used to have nothin'
Yeah, had to keep faith, came a long way
I'm fuckin' your bae and I'm runnin' away
Got a lot on my plate, gotta make some shape
And it ain't no brakes, yeah
