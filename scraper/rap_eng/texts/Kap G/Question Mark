[Intro: M-City J.r]
Lemme ask you this,
Question Mark
Are you the type to hold me down
And play your part
She said "i guess..."
Question Mark
You better not, you better know
Girl bless your heart
[Hook: M-City J.r]
You so fine, girl bless your heart (heart,heart,heart,heart,heart)
You so fine, girl bless your heart (bless your heart, bless your heart)
You so fine, girl bless your heart (heart,heart,heart,heart,heart)
You so fine girl and you know it
[Verse 1 : M-City J.r]
I know you know it
'Cause you 'bout it, 'bout it
Ooh, baby fine as hell
Ain't no denying 'bout it
Ooh, No. 9 Chanel
The smell i like about her
She smell like money money
I hit it watch it bounce back
Call it bungee jumpin'
I mean it's nothin' to me
All these franklins on me
You can sock it to me
Probably why these birdies
Keep on flocking to me
I'm talking twitter twitter
Everything that glitters isnÂ´t gold
Sometimes it's just glitter
I'm that nigga
I'm bouncing, buying California
By the thousands thousands
Rolling out the ounces
You can slide by,
Baby thick as hell,
She got that wide body
Inside my wide body
[Pre- Hook : M-City J.r]
Lemme ask you this,
Question Mark
Are you the type to hold me down
And play your part
She said "i guess..."
Question Mark
You better not, you better know
Girl bless your heart
[Hook: M-City J.r]
You so fine, girl bless your heart (heart,heart,heart,heart,heart)
You so fine, girl bless your heart (bless your heart, bless your heart)
You so fine, girl bless your heart (heart,heart,heart,heart,heart)
You so fine girl and you know it
[Verse 2: Kap G]
Now lemme ask you this:
Is you with the shits? (the shits)
If times ever got hard
Would you still be my bitch?
I wanna stunt hard baby
They gon' feel my drift
And she gon' take the charge, baby
That's why she my Miss
Yeaaah
Bonnie and Clyde,
She my ride or die
You know my bitch flyer
Yo bitch on a flyer
Stretch marks on that ass, yeah
That shit like a tiger
We just want that bag, yeah
You know she a rider
Come her and jump up on it
I'ma have you hooked up on it
I'll buy you Louie garments
She gon' hold the carbine
I'ma explore your garden
I just want that noggin'
She gon' keep it solid
Well baby
