[Pre-Chorus]
Boy stop calling my phone
I'm on one percent
Using my GPS
I'm on one percent
I can't answer no texts
I'm on one percent
Finna jump on a jet
Count me a check
I'm on one percent

[Chorus]
Nigga done called ten times
I'm on one percent
And he blowin up both lines
I'm on one percent
Now I gotta hit decline
I'm on one percent
I ain't tryna waste my time
I'm on one percent

[Verse 1]
Airplane mode on em
Number blocking hold on em
Both lines you know you miss me
Hating tryna jump on the wave like a boat rider
Oh yeah speaking, come for the weekend
He tryna reason bout to jump out the defend

Got some brand new bling
Left him on ring
Phone on one precent
Location on ping
I'm the girl of his dreams
Look in the car that's a cream (oh)
If you wanna take it farther
Gotta go harder
My feeling runnin like water

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy stop calling my phone
I'm on one percent
Using my GPS
I'm on one percent
I can't answer no texts
I'm on one percent
Finna jump on a jet
Count me a check
I'm on one percent

[Chorus]
Nigga done called ten times
I'm on one percent
And he blowin up both lines
I'm on one percent
Now I gotta hit decline
I'm on one percent
I ain't tryna waste my time
I'm on one percent

[Verse 2: Kap G]
She said come get lit (lit)
Take ten shots to the head (head)
I'm on one percent
My shit going dead
Always tryna go through my phone
Scrolling through my text
Brand new apple watch with the GPS
One in a million
That here so brilliant
Condo just buzz me in
She tryna love again
We friends with benefits
You know how women get
First they act innocent
Then catchin feelings quick

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy stop calling my phone
I'm on one percent
Using my GPS
I'm on one percent
I can't answer no texts
I'm on one percent
Finna jump on a jet
Count me a check
I'm on one percent

[Chorus]
Nigga done called ten times
I'm on one percent
And he blowin up both lines
I'm on one percent
Now I gotta hit decline
I'm on one percent
I ain't tryna waste my time
I'm on one percent

[Verse 3]
Try got face it
Can't do no basic
I heard she racing
Ain't finna chase her

I keep on coming back
Faster then a quarter-back
Just like a little I lack
I keep my runners with black
Don't know when they coming back

Niggas be stuck in they feelings
They all tryna blow up my cellular
Wake up and get it and ain't got no time
Like I don't do on a regular
Chasing like cain there's nothing like be fran
That's all on my schedule
Ice on my neck
Nothing but guess
My diamonds are minerals

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy stop calling my phone
I'm on one percent
Using my GPS
I'm on one percent
I can't answer no texts
I'm on one percent
Finna jump on a jet
Count me a check
I'm on one percent

[Chorus]
Nigga done called ten times
I'm on one percent
And he blowin up both lines
I'm on one percent
Now I gotta hit decline
I'm on one percent
I ain't tryna waste my time
I'm on one percent
