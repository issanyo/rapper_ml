(intro)

Oo I Just wanna know
I just wanna know why they hating on me
(on me)
Oo I just wanna know, i just wanna know why they plotting on me (on me)
Oo Nigga i ain't lyin' you know I'm a shine like a diamond on me
(on me)
I fuck wit OG's, fuck the police, they want a coffin on me

(Kap G Verse)

I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Why they killing all our brothers (why?)
Shoutout all the single monthers (i swear)
Imma go and buy a Hummer no fear
I've been at meetings with Russel (oh yea)
I know they want me to fumble (them bills)
My migos we moving through tunnels you square, you can't survive in the jungle

(Hook)

Everything ain't good where i'm from
They don't wanna see you doing good where i'm from
I was running out of patience
Recording out of basements
Money what i be making
Loud smoke in jamaica
Slay the pussy like Jason
Dear mother fucker say some
Miss me with that fade love
Thanking god when i wake up
A migo gotta stay prayed up
A migo gotta stay prayed up
Married to that paper
Like Will and Jaida, Jaida

(Kantu Verse)

I Came from the struggle (yea)
I Can’t escape trouble (nah)
Now they know who we are
My diamonds n all (wet)
We rose up a level
Recognize I’m a god
I gotta thank god (blessed)
I was born for the lamb
Destined for jets n I fly to Japan
Showing respect when I land
Almost didn’t make it
I Thought I was forsaken

I Dealt with destruction n
Pardoned my past
Balanced the bullshit that came with the laughs
Come where I’m from better keep u a stash
Riden’ the high but that shit never last

Ride till I die bro so don’t ever ask
Ready for war n la familia
Gettin this money
N laugh at the dummy’s
I’ll never forget who I am
Cuz I know that

Hook (Kantu and Kap G together)

Everything ain't good where i'm from
They don't wanna see you doing good where i'm from
I was running out of patience
Recording out of basements

Loud smoke in jamaica
Slay the pussy like Jason
Dear mother fucker say some
Miss me with that fade love
Thanking god when i wake up
A migo gotta stay prayed up
A migo gotta stay prayed up
Married to that paper
