[Intro]
In my cup, pour it up, in my cup
Kap G

[Chorus]
In my cup, pour it up, in my cup
Roll it up, roll it up, let's get slumped
You been up, you been up, you been up
That what's up, that what's up, that what's up
In my cup, pour it up, in my cup
Roll it up, roll it up, let's get slumped
You been up, I been up, I been up, I been
I been up, I been up, I been up, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm in the back of the bank, she in Alexander Wang
This a one of one, uh, ball like one on one
I had to run it up, uh, went got my money up, yeah
You are not one of us, yeah, you are not one of us, uh
And my partners got them bricks, they can build a house
Get 'em by the load, fly 'em to the dirty south
And my partners got them bricks, they can build a house
Get 'em by the load, fly 'em to the dirty south
Uh, talk about it, be about it, take another shot
Rap money came in, copped another loft
I got three much sauce, I had to be a boss
I feel like the gold baby, I can't see a loss

[Chorus]
In my cup, pour it up, in my cup
Roll it up, roll it up, let's get slumped
You been up, you been up, you been up
That what's up, that what's up, that what's up
In my cup, pour it up, in my cup
Roll it up, roll it up, let's get slumped
You been up, I been up, I been up, I been
I been up, I been up, I been up, yeah

[Verse 2]
These exclusives, my bitch is exclusive
These exclusive, she exclusive
I'm eatin' sushi, up my Gucci's
Hallucination baby, no fabrication baby
I got no patience with you, for no basic bitches
I got Asian bitches, even bi-racial bitches
I never faked it with you, no conversation with you
I even waited with you, I never hated with you
I let you ride the Phantom, and you can take it with you
I split the cover with you, act like a Fader issue
I leveled up in June, I'm rollin' up the fumes
I'm poppin' in BÃ©thune, my closet is a room

[Chorus]
In my cup, pour it up, in my cup
Roll it up, roll it up, let's get slumped
You been up, you been up, you been up
That what's up, that what's up, that what's up
In my cup, pour it up, in my cup
Roll it up, roll it up, let's get slumped
You been up, I been up, I been up, I been
I been up, I been up, I been up, yeah
