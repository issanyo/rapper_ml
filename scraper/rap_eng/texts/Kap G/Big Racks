[Verse 1: Kap G]
I was tryna get it, fuck a friend
We ain't gettin' money, come again now
I go KD when it's for the win
I'ma keep it solid 'til the end (for life)
Say you with me but really you pretend (you ain't my brother)
Pull up on your bitch, she gon' drop her pants down
Droptop I'ma pull up in a Benz (skrrt)
Swear I tote them racks like I was Jim Brown

[Chorus: Wes & Kap G]
Hey, I got big racks on my head

I got big racks on my head
I got big racks on my head now
Hey, I got big racks on my head
I got big racks on my head now
I got big racks on my head
I got big racks on my head now
I got big racks, I got big racks, I got
I got big racks, I got big racks, I got  (I got big racks on my head now)
I got big racks, I got big racks, I got (I got big racks on my)
I got big racks, I got big racks, I got (I got big racks on my head now)

[Verse 2: Kap G]
Focused, tryna stack a million
Get rich or die tryin', Fifty Cent
Many men, many men, many men
They don't really wanna see your boy win
Ain't have a check first, yeah, had to flip first, yeah
Had to network, yeah, to create my net worth, yeah
Getting cheese, known for that work, uh
Go to KOD, she got that leg work
Yeah, and I'm diving in head first (come here)
Yeah, I just wanna see how that neck work (good brain)
Yeah, I can't wait to buy that red vert (skrrt)
Yeah, put them ours in, I'm past work

[Chorus: Wes & Kap G]
Hey, I got big racks on my head
I got big racks on my head now
I got big racks on my head
I got big racks on my head now
Hey, I got big racks on my head
I got big racks on my head now
I got big racks on my head
I got big racks on my head now
I got big racks, I got big racks, I got
I got big racks, I got big racks, I got  (I got big racks on my head now)
I got big racks, I got big racks, I got (I got big racks on my)
I got big racks, I got big racks, I got (I got big racks on my head now)
