Young Kap G Dinero
Yea I'm just coolin' with my vatos (vato, vato, vato)
And I just left trabajo (work, work)
Finna cash this checke, Wells Fargo (finna cash this checke)
No cash no convo.  Everybody around me, mi hermanos (my brothers)
It ain't gotta be Cinco de Mayo, I still be coolin' with my vatos
It's just me and my vatos x4
I'm just coolin with my vatos

[VERSE 1]
She want it pronto, I know
White tee, Blanco
Momma in the kitchen whippin' arroz with the caldos
She say, "what you call those?”
True Religion cargos
I might crash into your girl
Don't worry I got Geico
Goodnight tho (skrrt), I'm iight tho
I wake up to a lot of Gin and (?)
I'm just tryna be a legend like El Santo (the wrestler)
I was stackin' green, and now they call me Rajon Rondo
We just a bunch of head honchos
And we don't mess with them Narcos
They so strapped like Pancho (Pancho Villa)
Tengo diez y nueve años

And my blunts be louder, and we got that pride uh
Tell your girl to wash my clothes with Tide uh
I'm tired, on the jet to D.C
Just like I’m Deshon uh, Jackson
Vatos got them packs and, you can't even blame em’
[?] brought the crack, and we got a lot of papers they say beat it, Michael Jackson
All-Star in pro sports, ballin' Bo Jackson
Vato, Vato, Vaatoo
Stackin' pesos like the Eiffel (Tower)
Yea Ray-bans on my face, I know they look like blindfolds
I'm in the Cleveland Cavalier tho, like I’m from Ohio
