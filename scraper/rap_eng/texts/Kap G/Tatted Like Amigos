[Intro: KAP G]
Shouts out to College Park
Them fucks don't give a fuck
Hit a home-run with your bitch
Chicago Cubs
And my goons strapped up
My OG boys
One shot to the chest
Aye that's that Derrick Rose

[Hook: KAP G]
Okay qué pasa mommy, hit a cart-wheel
She like the way I sling that D, no cartel
Okay qué pasa holmes
And you don’t want problemas
And we about a hundred deep
All my niggas, All my niggas
Tatted like amigos, es amigos
Tatted like amigos
All my niggas, all my niggas
Tatted like amigos
