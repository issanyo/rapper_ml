[Intro]
Squat made the beat
Go Grizz
Winner's circle

[Chorus: Kap G & Chef Cook It Up]
See the drugs so cray make you step it up
Yeah I'm on my own wave, gotta level up
And you can't be mad 'cause your bitch wit' us
When Kap G come around put your women up
Every time I'm out here you know I fuck the city up
Have you ever road around in a Bentley truck?
Errybody wanna love you, yeah when you up
Yuh, woah
But I ain't givin' up

[Verse 1: Kap G]
I told squad I want the Wraith, I done caught the plates
Gotta a bitch that walks in lace, I just want the face
Talkin' fifty shades of grey, I done MIA
I used to look up to Ye but now I'm rockin' Ye's
I just got these tailor made, I ain't major Flay
Had to go and make a way, you just in the way
I got different types of bitches just like Flava Flay
I got different types of bitches just like Flava Flay
I can go and buy the mall when I want to
Drop fifty for the club when I walk through
If you wanna get a verse, I'ma charge you
Trending lookin like an uber car pool

[Chorus: Kap G & Chef Cook It Up]
See the drugs so cray make you step it up
Yeah I'm on my own wave, gotta level up
And you can't be mad 'cause your bitch wit' us
When Kap G come around put your women up
Every time I'm out here you know I fuck the city up
Have you ever road around in a Bentley truck?
Errybody wanna love you, yeah when you up
Yuh, woah
But I ain't givin' up

[Verse 2: Chef Cook It Up]
30's on me like Curry, diamonds never tuck, aye
Bitches playin' wit' me, all they wanna do is fuck
She ain't fuck wit' me back when I was on the bust
I don't give a fuck, I bought Burberry a tux
Uh, want you gon' do for this shit?
I get the bag and then dip
Nigga don't fuck wit' the reals
Watchu doin', dawg?
I'm servin' green like Boston
Nigga be movin' too constant
I got your main bitch callin', uh
A nigga be ridin' the wave
A nigga be bitin' like sharks
Boy I don't fuck wit' the narks
Them drankers be pushing the carts
All of 'em once in a row(hoo)
[?] right by the stove
I don't fuck wit' the stove
I don't be trustin' these hoes

[Chorus: Kap G & Chef Cook It Up]
See the drugs so cray make you step it up
Yeah I'm on my own wave, gotta level up
And you can't be mad 'cause your bitch wit' us
When Kap G come around put your women up
Every time I'm out here you know I fuck the city up
Have you ever road around in a Bentley truck?
Errybody wanna love you, yeah when you up
Yuh, woah
But I ain't givin' up
