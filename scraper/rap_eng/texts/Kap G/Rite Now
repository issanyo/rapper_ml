[Intro]
I'm headed to the bank
Drum Dummie

Yeah, Kap G, JuggRich
(Run up them racks)

[Chorus: 1900Astro]
Right now, right now
Runnin' them racks up right now

[Verse 1: 1900Astro]
Runnin' the racks up right now
Fuck the lil bitch she piped now
Doin' shows across the globe
Bitch we in Dubai now
I swear to God I never go outside
If I ever lose my ho it's gon' be bad
They call me rich but I came from rags
No shoes in them shoebox, that's for them stacks
They caught you slippin' 'cause they know you lackin'
One hundred or better, I'm the main attraction

[Chorus: 1900Astro]
Runnin' them racks up right now
Runnin' them racks up right now
Right now, right now
Runnin' them racks up right now
Right now, right now

Runnin' them racks up right now

[Verse 2: Kap G]
I'm in the Wraith like right now
Tell that lil bitch to pipe down
I want that cash like right now, yeah
I want that bag like right now
Went and got it on my own, I wasn't askin' for none'
I was just dead broke, now I'm havin' for somethin'
Secure the bag, I want the bag
I want the bag, I want them racks
I got a foreign, that bitch is bad
Or that's your bitch, she gettin' dragged
I got money on my mind, I got hundreds on my mind
I be lovin' dollar signs, she be fuckin' every time
Right now, right now
Runnin' that check like right now
I got a whip like right now
She give me the neck like right now
I'ma just go hit the Blue Flames
That ain't no money, that's loose change
You lil pussies havin' mood swings
In that foreign switchin' two lanes

[Chorus: 1900Astro]
Runnin' them racks up right now
Runnin' them racks up right now

[Verse 3: Coca Vango]
Rolex on me right now
VV in me right now
If you talkin' like a bitch, better pipe down
'Cause I'll take a nigga's bitch, better pipe down
Big Glock on me right now
I'm so hot like right now
They want my spot like right now
They want my spot like right now
That broke shit, that's so yesterday
That cake on me like right now
The molly poking out my pocket
Pull a [?] and bite down
Heard you made 40K last year
Got 45k on me right now
Got them G-Star jeans with the thigh pad
Got a quarter mil strong off an iPad, it's Coke

[Chorus: 1900Astro]
Runnin' them racks up right now
Runnin' them racks up right now
Right now, right now
Runnin' them racks up right now

Runnin' them racks up
(I'm headed to the bank)
Runnin' them racks up

[Verse 4: 1900Astro]
I'm the leader of the new school
I had two bitches but they left me for school
When I was young my mama said I'm the truth
Don't lie to me, I can handle the truth
I know you wasnâ€™t who you said but it's cool
I had a couple cars, my fave was a coupe
I had better but my favorite was you
I love money, baby show me the loot

[Outro: 1900Astro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah
I'm headed to the bank
Hey, hey, yeah-eah-eah
Yeah-eah-eah
I'm headed to the bank
The things you do to me baby
I'm headed to the bank
The things you do to me baby
I'm headed to the bank
