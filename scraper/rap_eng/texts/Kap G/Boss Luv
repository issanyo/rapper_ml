[Intro: Kap G]
If you went down with me would you still stay down with me?
If, if you stayed down with me baby you can climb with me

[Chorus: Kap G]
She like the way I Gucci-ed the belt
And she like the way I carry myself
And she got her own, don't need no help
And around you girl I can be myself
I'm looking for love in the winter time
Pull up in a foreign, no Enterprise
Pull up in a drop in winter time
And I will not stop 'til I make you mine
You're the only one I want, we can go shopping on Pawns, yeah
Let me know what it cost, I'll have you drippin' in sauce, yeah
She wanna fuck with a boss, she wanna fuck with a boss
She fell in love with my floss, she fell in love with my floss

[Verse 1: Kap G]
I know you still with your other man
Tell lil bro go do the running man
You were there when I had nothing man
Now I turn fifty to a hundred bands
She the same now, she gon' stay down when shit hit the fan
LA Playhouse, bring the Wraith out, 'cause I'm feeling like the man
I'ma pull up 'cause I can, paparazzi with the cam
Pockets sloppy with them bands, pocket rocket in my pants
I got plenty to go around, you the one and I know it now
Tell them other bitches tone it down
Hennessy, I'ma pour the brown
Let's make a toast that we made it out (made it out)
I'm faded now (I'm faded now)
I been patient now (been patient now)
Wanna take you down
In your town one day, I'm out
Come here girl, let's make it count
We don't do no basic now
Commas in my bank account

[Chorus: Kap G]
She like the way I Gucci-ed the belt
And she like the way I carry myself
And she got her own, don't need no help
And around you girl I can be myself
I'm looking for love in the winter time
Pull up in a foreign, no Enterprise
Pull up in a drop in winter time
And I will not stop 'til I make you mine
You're the only one I want, we can go shopping on Pawns, yeah
Let me know what it cost, I'll have you drippin' in sauce, yeah
She wanna fuck with a boss, she wanna fuck with a boss
She fell in love with my floss, she fell in love with my floss

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Yeah she know I'm a boss (boss)
I'm drippy, I'm drippin' in sauce (I'm drippin')
Rockin' the Gucci, this ain't no Lacoste
All white diamonds lookin' like frost (all white)
Ride the Maybach like I'm Ross, yeah
Get it whenever she want, don't care what it cost
She gon' stay down when the lights off
She gon' be there when I take a loss
We at the top, we at the top of the loft (we at the top, yeah)
Just check my account, damn, look what I bought (damn, look what I bought)
Bad bitch and that pussy like Voss (damn)
I put a half a mil in the vault (half a mil)
I got three hundred on me worth of ice (three hundred)
I been a boss all of my life (all of my life)
I got a coupe worth another two (coupe)
Yeah I ball, bitch I know how to shoot (I ball)
She gon' eat it, no tooth, ooh (eat it)
Hundred bands in my pocket like ooh (hundred bands)
Damn (damn), bossed up at Ruth Chriss eatin' lamb (bossed up)
I do whatever, you do what you can (I do whatever)
You is a boy, she want a man (she want a man)

[Chorus: Kap G]
She like the way I Gucci-ed the belt
And she like the way I carry myself
And she got her own, don't need no help
And around you girl I can be myself
I'm looking for love in the winter time
Pull up in a foreign, no Enterprise
Pull up in a drop in winter time
And I will not stop 'til I make you mine
You're the only one I want, we can go shopping on Pawns, yeah
Let me know what it cost, I'll have you drippin' in sauce, yeah
She wanna fuck with a boss, she wanna fuck with a boss
She fell in love with my floss, she fell in love with my floss
