[Intro]
Hey, ay yi yi

[Chorus]
I gotta light up, light up
Smoke one for my real amigos
Locked up, locked up
No girlfriend, I ain't gettin'
Caught up, caught up
Baby girl, if you ain't fuckin'
Then your time up, time up
Girl, time up, time up, girl
I just, I just might keep it for a week (ay yi yi, ay yi yi)
I just, I just might keep it for a week (ay yi yi, ay yi yi)
I just, I just might keep it for a week (ay yi yi, ay yi yi)
Keep it for a week, keep it for a week

[Verse 1]
I just, I just might hit you on the beach (Murda)
I don't play games, girl, no Nintendo Wii (no, no)
You do shit, girl and damn, girl, you reek
Not a freak a leak, she just a friend, Biz Markie
I just, I just might pull up in the Jeep (skrrt)
The amigos so cool, I might bring back chachis
Ayy, your boyfriend so lame, he got cornrows and beats
I'm a minority with bitches majority with me
And I got my team with me and I got my team with me
And I got my team with me and I got my team with me
And I got the plug with me and I got the plug with me
He brought the lean with him, he brought the lean with him

[Chorus]
I gotta light up, light up
Smoke one for my real amigos
Locked up, locked up
No girlfriend, I ain't gettin'
Caught up, caught up
Baby girl, if you ain't fuckin'
Then your time up, time up
Girl, time up, time up, girl
I just, I just might keep it for a week (ay yi yi, ay yi yi)
I just, I just might keep it for a week (ay yi yi, ay yi yi)
I just, I just might keep it for a week (ay yi yi, ay yi yi)
Keep it for a week, keep it for a week

[Verse 2]
I just, I just might put you in a sweep (ooh)
Fuck house keepin', mami, you wash the sheets (okay)
Your man gettin' mad, girl, put him on a leash (yeah)
The loud got me geekin' like a dweeb, caught me screech (huh)
Put it through your legs, girl, you reach then I teach
G on the hood of Missy and Kareem
You say that she single, but what that post to mean?
What you want be eatin', no AJ and free
Free my partners with sentences like son Marice
And my primo got chickens like rotisserie
And I got my team with me and I got my team with me
Now she wanna leave with me, now she wanna leave with me

[Chorus]
I gotta light up, light up
Smoke one for my real amigos
Locked up, locked up
No girlfriend, I ain't gettin'
Caught up, caught up
Baby girl, if you ain't fuckin'
Then your time up, time up
Girl, time up, time up, girl
I just, I just might keep it for a week (ay yi yi, ay yi yi)
I just, I just might keep it for a week (ay yi yi, ay yi yi)
I just, I just might keep it for a week (ay yi yi, ay yi yi)
Keep it for a week, keep it for a week

[Verse 3]
Darling, darling
Got amigos all the way up in

Ayy, man, free all my amigos outchea, man

[Chorus]
I gotta light up, light up
Smoke one for my real amigos
Locked up, locked up

Then your time up, time up
Girl, time up, time up, girl
