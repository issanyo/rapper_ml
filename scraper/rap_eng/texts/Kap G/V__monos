Touchdown in Atlanta, boi it's time to make a hit
Got a little paper now it's time to make it flip, uh
Let's go in that esco, I might bring back Escalades
Vamonos dominos, knock 'em down, let's get paid
A lot of these rappers ain't about a nickel
Flame in the street cause I gotta get 'em
Came from the I.E. to the valley with it
And she just wanna see bout a 'Cali nigga
I've been stylin'
Get stalley
You're flier than your stylist
I got one girl with no mollys
Shoutout good girls in college
Yeah boy, I'm livin' motivation
They thought we're lackin', they were so mistaken
It don't get you nowhere, control the hatin'
My girl at home and she's been over-patient
I said I gotta go collect a lot of dough
And checks'll process slow
So cash gotta come from every direction
Learn it or repeat the lesson
Are there any questions?
I didn't think so, bounce
