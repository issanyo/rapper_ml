[Intro]
You can't tell me nothin’
You can't tell me nothin'(at all)
You can’t tell me nothin'(yuh, yuh)
Hey

[Chorus]
I keep it a hunnid, keep it a hunnid
Just like you 'posed to(a hunnid)
We came from that corner
Now we gettin' on, I'm ballin' tremendously(tremendously)
I got a feelin' she feelin' me(feelin’)
I do not trust my enemies(my enemies)
I do not show ’em no sympathy(sympathy)
Top a Migo, drown in Kennedy(hey)
I got the sauce and it been on me
I go some family at home that depend on me(let's go)
Smokin’ that gas like a chimney
Ain't gettin' money, they said this ability(hey)
I gotta go, couldn't be broke(no broke)
I gotta go, couldn’t be broke(no)

[Verse 1]
Kap where you been?
I just been mobbin'
They stay down where you stay
Up in the hills, plannin on mils
I've been up all night(all night), I've been up all night(all night)
I've been up all night(all night), I've been up all night
And I don't wanna come down(can't come down)
Remember when I was on my own
Now you wanna come around, you ain't stay down, we been poppin'
No later on, we got now, ain't no option(ain't no option)
They never gave me nothin', diamonds cost a 20
They never gave me nothin', Gucci on my bunions(gold)
I was down bad(I was), I had to bounce back
Pockets like a thou' pair, ooo how you count that?

[Chorus]
I keep it a hunnid, keep it a hunnid
Just like you 'posed to(a hunnid)
We came from that corner
Now we gettin' on, I'm ballin' tremendously(tremendously)
I got a feelin' she feelin' me(feelin')
I do not trust my enemies(my enemies)
I do not show 'em no sympathy(sympathy)
Top a Migo, drown in Kennedy(hey)
I got the sauce and it been on me
I go some family at home that depend on me(let's go)
Smokin' that gas like a chimney
Ain't gettin' money, they said this ability(hey)
I gotta go, couldn't be broke(no broke)
I gotta go, couldn't be broke(no)

[Verse 2]
I remember when we came from nothin'(nothin')
Look at me now, walkin' around wit' a big bank roll(big roll, bank roll, big roll)
Everybody say they was there but they wasn't
But [?] that, I'ma go and [?] it up some more(gonna go [?] it up, [?] it up)
I got on racks in my pants, make it hard for me dance, yeah(aye)
I still look out for my fam, you put it on for the gram, yeah(aye)
I got 'em rack on the way, held down bad, had to find me a way
Now I'm in bed wit' your bae, told her I just want the face, yeah
I'm stashin' the [?], case I get down(case I get down)
Swear they be backstabbin' when I'm not around(around)
We had it bad back then but we want it now(we want it now)
You had the bag back then, well look at me now(yeah)

[Chorus]
I keep it a hunnid, keep it a hunnid
Just like you 'posed to(a hunnid)
We came from that corner
Now we gettin' on, I'm ballin' tremendously(tremendously)
I got a feelin' she feelin' me(feelin')
I do not trust my enemies(my enemies)
I do not show 'em no sympathy(sympathy)
Top a Migo, drown in Kennedy(hey)
I got the sauce and it been on me
I go some family at home that depend on me(let's go)
Smokin' that gas like a chimney
Ain't gettin' money, they said this ability(hey)
I gotta go, couldn't be broke(no broke)
I gotta go, couldn't be broke(no)
