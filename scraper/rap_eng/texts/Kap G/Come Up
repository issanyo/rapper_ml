I stay down from the come up
Come up, come up, come up
Come up, come up, come up

[Hook]
I stay down for the come up
And I'm gettin' commas
Commas, commas, commas, commas
I stay down for the come up
I stay down for the come up

I like my girls in two
Your girl she a two
My bitch, she a eight, oh yeah plus two
And the number one rule: can't never get judged
Got a girl named Stilla, think I found my groove
With your boys you gridin', If he A approved
She say "How you doing?"
"Bien mami, y tu?"
She said she like my troop, but this not a big zoo
I said "I like your Journey shoes, but they're fufu"

I stay down for the come up
Migos playing with the keys, Stevie Wonder
Commas, commas, commas, commas
Sippin' Austin Powers with my pinkie showin'
I hope you talkin' money man if I don't know ya
Bad Pocahontas, beat it like ?
I'm felxin', flexin', flexin'
I just pulled my ?

[Hook]
Drive by like "zoom!"
"Vruum, vruum, vruum!"
Walk in make a movie, and that shit comin' soon
When the money start comin', they be claimin' we cool
But they start actin' fun of me, no-no Tom Cruise
