[Intro: Jeffrey Digit$]
Why is it when you suffer I should suffer too?
Ain't there enough that we been going thru
Let us spread the wings please don't try to shoot
We be going far away every single time we do it
Why the fuck can't we just stay there
You screaming god no, I'm like hell yeah
Two things changed since last year
The number on the calendar and perception of the fears

[Verse 1: Jeffrey Digit$]
Why when you say you love me I should say that too
I'm not saying it ain't true it's just kinda cruel
Got myself I'm a maze I still stay amazed
By how I got you figured out you know I can't lie straight
Damn, feels like it happened overnight don't it
I keep falling for you, you can't keep ignoring
I'm asking not to worry, staring death in the eye
As a reminder you still visit my head all the time
The music gets born on the second circle
The last thing on my mind is trying to hurt you
Frankly speaking I don't mind being blamed for shit
At least I know for sure there's never late for me
And I ain't on the tv, but get the cam ready
The stuff is getting super nasty when we keep it steady
Let if flow let it go nothing I can't handle
The chain piece is looking at me damn it got me saying

[Bridge: Jeffrey Digit$]
LionPiece, LionPiece
Take it all off but the LionPiece

[Verse 2: Jeffrey Digit$]
And so we stay up, all night, she yells fuck you, I say all right
Hot day met a cold night, just lift your head to see the sky
We keep breaking up then making up, cooling down then baking up
When the chips are down you can see what's up
Shit, how can I leave when I see the tears
Nothing's infinite but what stops us from switching reels
I've switched three cities in a fucking week
That's not only cuz I'm getting sick of fucking standing still
Polish my sorrow with a soft drink
Keep saying to myself fuck it I don't feel shit
There's no forgetting things we crave for
Getting through the veggies brings out the dessert fork
Took a bite and I almost faded
We better keep going, you be like fucking make me
You know there's no way back when you say that baby
The chain piece is staring at me shit it got me yelling

[Hook: Jeffrey Digit$]
LionPiece, LionPiece
Take it all off but the LionPiece
When the time comes hope I'll rest in peace
But right now let me get a piece
Right now let me get a (uh)
LionPiece, LionPiece
Take it all off but the LionPiece
When the time comes hope I'll rest in peace
But right now let me get a piece
But right now let me get a piece

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
(It's Mickey)
Love is supposed to be about trustin
But the way you been actin I can't function
Conjunction junction yeah I got tough skin
My heart takin this spontaneous combustion
We break up then make up but wait up
It's sad how your them tears got your makeup
It's bad how you can't see my fears pick your face up
Please let it stay up this should be as easy as a layup
Son of Mufasa with my lion piece product
You my real-life Nala but you put me thru drama
You scream I holla you lead I follow
Routine routine you tease I gotta get this right
Im not tryna fight with the future of my life
I want you to be my wife
And truthfully you're wrong but usually you're right
So if you could see the light we could truly make it bright, outasight
(Factz)

LionPiece, LionPiece
Take it all off but the LionPiece

But right now let me get a piece
Right now let me get a (uh)
LionPiece, LionPiece
Take it all off but the LionPiece
When the time comes hope I'll rest in peace
But right now let me get a piece
But right now let me get a piece
