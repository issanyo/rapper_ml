[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Intro: Keith Haring]
If you love life, if you appreciate life and humans, then you should be against anything that's going against life and against people

[Verse 1]
Green paper had the streets wild
Drug dealers needed pagers for their cream pile
Dream chaser tryna reach clouds
I was a teenager with a mean style
16, Grew up in the Bronx
Pj's, urine in the halls
Pops at work, moms at the job
My uncle introduced me to the art
But I, went to school... That's false
Cause I drew... On the walls
And I used... Alotta chalk
And a spray can that I paint with on the floors
Its 1983
All of the trains that's over me
Are filled with paint that I could see
Graffiti laced and it felt so free
Check me out but don't trip out
Got no friends so I stick out
Kept on failing, caught on surveillance
Tagged on a building, ma flipped out
I went to school but I slipped out
I felt school was the jail house
My father told me get out
Now everyday I gotta live out
Went downtown, met other artists
Slept on couches, sometimes floors
Turn-style jumping, no haircut
Stole once a day, sometimes more
And that's fine... Sacrifice
My soul came back to life
But there were nights that I grabbed the knife
To cope with strife I had to slice
Slept outside, that's alright
I was glad to write
I grabbed the dice, tryna gamble life
Call me MauSe, I attracted mice and that's my plight
There comes a point in everybody's thinking
If you don't chase after you dreams what's the point of sleeping
Gotta want what you dream and dream what you want
Gotta love what you do and do what you love
Fan of Disney, I named myself mickey
But I had so many questions so the marks I left were risky
And instead of leaving a period I just left a symbol
So you Ain't have to worry bout the answers I could give you

[Hook: Key Wane]
My eyes can not remember, the things that's so familiar
The choices in life are difficult but it leads to memorabilia
Memorabilia
Memorabilia
Memorabilia
Memorabilia

[Break: Randy]
I think it was very nice of whoever made that statue to dedicate it to the hospital. Thought it was very nice of him. I think it stands for peace, love. Children can do whatever they want if they try hard enough

[Hook]

[Outro: Randy]
Annnnd that's all!
