[Intro]
Thank you achievers
I had 4.14 in my bank account
I had 4.14 in my bank account
Now you see why I ain't wanna rap with artists
Buy colors when it ain't nothing to paint about
So I got on my knees this is what I pray about
Lord God my dreams
My dreams x 9
Son wake up
Son wake up
This is your father talking
Your job is not done
Wake up
Do what you are called to
You are the descendent of king

[Verse: Mickey Factz]
My pops woke me up and told me I'm the illest out
It's crazy cause these are dreams I'm spitting out
4:14 in the morning, pouring my spirit out
Last year those three numbers was in the kid account
This year I'm getting that cheese
Looking for Swiss accounts
Next year, I want so many keys
It's hard for Swizz to count
Saw a bum from the box he was living out
So I gave him 425
Cause I was almost a guy
Who couldn't afford to be fly
When I was in the drought
Ten minutes later that same bum had a Guinness Stout
Wasn't even mad, he took the liquor route
Cause I did the same thing
Just to get the feelings out
Do this for the people with goals writing these lyrics out
Cause I know how it's like to be broke and people kick you out
Then they want to rewrite the story
And say without them how you wouldn't have got the glory
Think I lose my number for real
Don't try to call me
Answer machine after seven rings I'm Robert Horry
Shout-out to Key Wane for the record I redecorated
Shout-out to Zeno for the video it was elevated
Shout-out to MTV for showing it that was record breaking
Cried in Chicago, reciting it
I was devastated
Cause I didn't think I'd ever make it
I got back on my feet
Done levitated (wooo!)
Y'all don't know how it's like to be semi-famous
Hungry with no money and too proud to ever say it
It wasn't for my achievers
There probably wouldn't be no music out of your speakers
I thank god everyday for all of my believers
They say I do more for their thinking than any teachers
And for those who think this tape is about sneakers
It's not, but I run these MCs in my Adidas
A four-fourteen had me going through a crash course
Now they don't giving the people just what they ask for
Sixteen corners was enough to give me transports
Now my kicks cost the decimal after the last four (do the math!)
That's a clue in a tax
Brush you with the paper
Y'all know it was facts

[Outro]
Your destiny awaits you
Embrace it
