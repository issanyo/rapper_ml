All I want is respect
You ain't know by now
You ain't learn that much
I don't respond to a sublime
It ain't hurt that much
All I want is respect
Nothing more, nothing less
Don't fuck with a vet
You ain't know by now
You ain't learn that much
I don't respond to a sublime
It ain't hurt that much

I'm all on your monitor, letting go a verse or two
Looky here, Monica, don't take it personal
I won't make it personal, in plain English
I rock cause I'm hot so I need to get extinguished
Cool, look here kid, throught the day and night
I'm Neil Armstrong cause I been taking flight
So sick, got the cooties, when I make these songs
I'm on a island somewhere, no A.C. on
I don't feel some type of way, so I think you shouldn't
But I'm saying what I feel cause I think you wouldn't
I'm doing things that I think you couldn't
You can't see the vision, put my glasses on I don't think you looking
I see what my retina shows
I'm sure America knows that I'm better with flows
Don't enter the scope, if you blink, rookie
I put a jimmy on her, scoop your girl for her pink cookies

All I want is respect
Nothing more, nothing less
Cause I'm one of the best
You ain't know by now
You ain't learn that much
I don't respond to a sublime
It ain't hurt that much
All I want is respect
Nothing more, nothing less
Don't fuck with a vet
You ain't know by now
You ain't learn that much
I don't respond to a sublime
It ain't hurt that much

See you doing your thing, laid the whole plan out
But fuck a battle homey, we can bring the bands out
It's all good when you see me, got your hand out
But you acting like a motherfucker need a handout
Lost my keys to rap's house, so I stand out
Lyrically, put you in the dirt then pull a plant out
Stick to your roots, baby I'm stunting
The Leak, Vol. 3: A Mixtape About Something
Yeah, it's the Achievement, and yes I'm incredible
Ask anybody about you, they'll say you're terrible
This is so general, Factz really spitting
I'm universal, don't pack me in a division
It's all love, rap is a competition
And I'm the composition written for the opposition
Even a doctor listens, check my position
A Rod of the game, Guggenheim bitches

All I want is respect
Nothing more, nothing less
Cause I'm one of the best
You ain't know by now
You ain't learn that much
I don't respond to a sublime
It ain't hurt that much
All I want is respect
Nothing more, nothing less
Don't fuck with a vet
You ain't know by now
You ain't learn that much
I don't respond to a sublime
It ain't hurt that much

Homey I been hot, I take all responsibility
And consequences for what my pen jot
My sixth sense say these cats doubt I'm too cool
Now I guess I got to blackout on YouTube
You and I not the same, so I jot this rhyme
To shout the guys who have a spotless mind
It's automatic, plus this shit's electronic
Internet gorilla, digital messiah, I got it
My eyes are crooked without these Prada optics
The stars on the side of them, I ain't got to lie to them
I chill in crowds, but I dropped out of college
So it's real hard for me to choose music over knowledge
This is not a diss song, it's a slick song
Sublimes go undetected until you look for them
I push forward, never backtrack the stats
'Til next time, that be the facts

All I want is respect
Nothing more, nothing less
Cause I'm one of the best
You ain't know by now
You ain't learn that much
I don't respond to a sublime
It ain't hurt that much
All I want is respect
Nothing more, nothing less
Don't fuck with a vet
You ain't know by now
You ain't learn that much
I don't respond to a sublime
It ain't hurt that much
