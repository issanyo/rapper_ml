[Intro:]
Do me a favor
Turn the lights down low
Yes I mean it real low there we go
Right there right there
Also, see I’m trying to put my lighter up
If you got a lighter turn that joint on
Keep it on
If you don’t got a lighter
Turn your cell phones on
Point it to the TV
It’s Mickey
Let’s go

[Verse 1:]
Sup
You don’t fuck with a n*gga no more
How could you not fuck with me no more
I ain’t stuck in my feelings no more
But let me tell you what did it hold on
I looked out for you
Little Rock got treated like family
I even vouched for you
My n*gga cosigned with a jimmy handy
What the fuck is wrong with you
Hands up in the air if you relate then
Dealing with the same dumb situation
Help a mother fucker out and don’t say shit when you need
Damn that’s cold
I’m in the front seat sitting low playing Kanye West
Drive slow with a screwed up voice cuz a n*gga don’t know
How to feel with somebody that he thought was his bro
Can’t even come through
N*gga got dos
I didn’t put you on shows
I didn’t get a n*gga flows
Guess when you get grown everybody gets bold I don’t know
Can’t lie I shed a tear when I’m alone
Cuz I don’t let people in
I don’t let people know
When you’re playing with art you’re playing with my soul
You playing with my heart I ain’t playing with you dawg
I swear on my mom better get up on your phone
And give a n*gga a call about the shit going on

[Chorus:]
I see them fuck n*ggas over there
We don’t fuck with n*ggas over there
I see them fuck n*ggas over there
We don’t fuck with n*ggas over there
Over here over there over there over there
See them fuck n*ggas over there
We don’t fuck with n*ggas over there
See them fuck n*ggas over there
We don’t fuck with n*ggas over there
Over there over there over there over there

[Verse 2:]
No no no
Don’t turn the lights up
Leave them where they at
They stay right there
Y’all put your lighters back in the air
Put your phones back in the air
I need to feel that energy
You know what I’m saying
I was talking to Lupe
Other day see we’re trying to change lives
With the shit that we say
Teach people how to rhyme
Gotta teach a new way
Piece of me is like a funeral today
Wrote it all out it’s a beautiful decay
I swear n*ggas phony
It’s tired of my OGs
Guess n*ggas don’t know me
From the Bronx
Where the pussy gets sold on the corner
And the mothers can’t ever find daughters
And the sink never stopped dripping waters
My man Pop got shot for a quarter
Broad daylight no Diane Sawyer
Where a n*gga old bread act like he never saw you
Looking out for yourself everybody is a void
So I got tough skin
Gotta watch you with a n*gga girlfriends
Now I see I gotta start being fake giving cold handshakes for the win
No more pretend don’t call me again
That’s what I told a girl being phony again
Bitch try to front like we homies again No
You can never blow me again
If you a Mickey Factz fan
You know I don’t curse
You know I knows facts
I keep shit real
I never get mad
But n*ggas out here got it fucked up bad
Word of my niece getting tired of you n*ggas
No more no more lying with you n*ggas
No more no more lying with you n*ggas
For real I ain’t even got time for you n*ggas

[Chorus]
