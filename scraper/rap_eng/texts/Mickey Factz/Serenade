[Intro - Bane sample]
You think darkness is your ally
You merely adopted the dark
I was born in it
Molded by it
I didn't see the light until I was already a man
By then it was nothing to me but blinding!

[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]
As I toast the chardonnay
I hear the ghost of Marvin Gaye
So for the next six minutes
All you're gonna hear is the spirit in my lyrics
What's goin' on, unpaid cable
Left my label, their unchanged angle
Tried to outfox me, Bad Boy locks me
But NYU law taught me about proxies
Reborn Martin Luther
I'm in a new position don't need Kama Sutra
Stylings for my ex, ? her
I stopped lookin' for her when I thought about my future
Passive, artist with a passion
Sculptor, when it come to clay I'm Cassius
Vulture, when it's time to pray, I'm a mantis
The culture, what it is today, outlandish
Mr. Fantastic will think that the fashion's in Y-3 fabric
Polo bedspread on a king sized mattress
So every night, I can dream about pastures
Love when I ran by your city
Stand by Mickey if you can't find Diddy
They say I'm lazy
My catalog'll fill a terabyte like a vampire bit me
Woah, woah, woah, hold it
Icon poet and I barely even show it
Langston Hughes made my views so I wrote it
I do it for my mama but I don't think she know it
Thick beard and I spit flare
The achievement is comin' out this year
Let the words penetrate through yah
LoveAtFirstSound, let it serenade to yah

[Hook: Tony Williams]x2
Smile the pain through
You're cryin', ain't you?
Time will make you
Fine, thank you

[Verse 2: Mickey Factz]
Young man from the ghetto
Wifey preggo, real life gecko
She wanted assurance, he wanna settle
Makin' of his ? that ring black and yellow
Decent little job, payin' all the bills
Savin' for a house and prayin' for a mil
Where the 401k at?
Southside of Chicago, that's where he stays at
Southside of Chicago, that's where they spray at
He's tryna be out, cause he 'ont really play that
Good man with a good plan
Shook hands with the jeweler and he put grands
Into the ring he bought to give to her
This is the dream he thought for his future
Imagine, family matters
But nothing could compare for what's about to happen
Wifey texts him, "head to the market
Pick up an orange, ice cream, I'm starvin'
Pack of chicken legs, plus a milk carton
For the last time, please don't forget the margarine"
He wrote back, "Baby don't worry"
She replied, "Hurry, I wanna cook curry"
He got her all the groceries and jumped in his Hummer
But then, halfway home, he forgot the butter
Turned back around, bought that and donuts
And just to surprise her, he even got roses
Headed back home and he stopped at a light
When shots started goin' through his car, ?
Oh shit, he died
Notified his girlfriend, she cried
Blood on the flowers that he got
And now his one chance to be happy has been shot

[Hook: Tony Williams]x2
