[Intro]
Mickey, Factz
Third Entry: Mayhem
These Are My Thoughts, Things That, I See The World, As
And Having A Reflective Mind Off Of It, You Know
I Kinda Want yall to like, Listen To The Lyrics
And open Your Mind a Little Bit towards it, ya know
Black apple...Biiitch!

[Verse]
We Got Tall Buildings And Shorter Answers
Wide Freeways, Slimmer Changes
We Spend More, Just To Have Less
And Ball Out Of Control, Sometimes In Excess
Then We Earn Degrees To Have Less Sense
Working Like A King and Can't Find A Princess
Cop Big Houses, For Small Families
Go For Plan A but Settled With Plan B's
So Knowledgeable, with No Judgment
Wanna Be Famous, And Yet Hide From The Public
So Many Experts For more Problems
More Stress, More Death, More Flowers
Life Is Short, Damn We Need More Hours
Lost towers, gained love, raw power
Tons of Medicine, but less Healing
Gimmicks In Abundance, less feeling
My Mama Always Told Me Never Stress Millions
It's Hard When You Broke and you Dream, Miss Williams
Then we say we Drink Too Much And Smoke Crazy
DZA ain't smoke and I'd Say he Smokes Crazy
Laugh Too Little And Drive Too Fast
And Drink While I Do It Praying I Won't Crash
You See These Haters In This World Praying I Won't Last
Reciting All My Songs Playing My whole Tracks
Stay Up and Late Wake Up Tired
Complain About Faith, But Wanna Escape Fire
Cut Off The TE, And Then I Read A Book
I Never Knew Words entertained, Cause I Never looked
I Get Angry Quick, But I'm Mad Cool
I multiplied Possessions, But lost Values
I'm Still Scared Of The lecture That God's Got For Me
My Future's Ready, Afraid Of God's Prophecies
I Used To Like Kirk Franklin and God's Property
Until I Heard How He Was profiting off God's property
I Tried Not To Hate, Continue Showing Love
And Keep On Showing Love When No One Does
We Make A Living But Not Living Life
It Feel Right I'm Living But Not Living Right
We Set Foot On The Moon, allegedly
But I Have Troubles Talking To Neighbors I Never See
I Always Think About All The Things I Could Be
And how I'd Still Be Mickey Factz if I Could Dream
I Want The Joy That a rose petal brings
I Just Want Better Things...
Factz
