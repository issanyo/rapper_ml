Hey what’s up, it’s your boy DJ O.Minaya representing the union, sick mix radio.com and don’t forget each and every Saturday night I’m at Vapour Lounge in the Bronx, 3758 East Treemont Avenue, right off of Randall Avenue. Ladies, you’re more than welcome, fellas, come out there’s no cover charge, neat dress code, come out and have a good time and tune into W-LLL FM
