[Verse 1]
I was the guy they doubt
They said I wasn't it
I was counted out
Without a number slip
Now they crowd around talking bout they wanna flick
You know how that sound
Like the dumbest shit I ever heard, word
I ain't really that concerned
Rock and get it
You ain't never where everywhere I'm at
You ain't never there
I ain't throwing money all in the air
That ain't shit I wanna share
Shelfish when it come to that
This is me on the track
Look to the mirror tell yourself its me when I rap
From around town where my boys beef for a stack
Where they stay abreast when they put these on her lap
Got your freak on my lap
And we just vibin how we should
Why you posted up hatin on how we look
My paper right
My momma good
She told me last night she wanna go to hollywood
Where the stars at cause it ain't cold there
I told her I'mma star and she ain't gotta go there
I heat it up like Dwyane Wayne
Gotta maintain
Wat up tho
Chitty chitty bang bang

[Hook]
I got the homies in ur town like wat up tho
The ladies come around like what up tho
Even haters that we found say what up tho

[Verse 2]
I was the one they hate
Nobody gave a damn
They told me to my face
I ain’t in their plans
Now im getting funnel cake
They wanna shake my hand
You know wat I say
Get your hating a** around me
I don’t see how you could doubt me
Coming thorough your county
People wanna crown me
Cleaned up left with thick paper no bounty
So hater tell me how thats sounding
See im never browsing
Gotta always bring it up
Love to go shopping
They propose when they ring it up
Bottle of lovon on deck
I'mma drink it up
Money on my mind
Can you tell me what im thinking up
Ahahahahahaha
Peace up euro
One way trip to an island with a Virgo
Show em paradise
While you mad at life
I bet it eats u up inside like a parasite
Bet I’m doing better then I ever did before
And I’m only getting better
So I’m heading for the door
Gotta lock it from the inside
Cause we super high
This shit mean
Guggenheim
