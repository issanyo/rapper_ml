[Verse 1 - Mickey Factz]
We was at Cats, delicate essen in the back
Arguing about this, yelling at me about that
I wanna be cool, you wanna be mad
Michael Jackson on blast
I’m just zoning the bad, the way you make me feel is so sad
I painted a painting of me and you painted a girl in the painting
Creating amazing creations and look how you take it
You making me angry for nothing, you basically saying we breaking up
Fuck it, you know what? I’m just gonna go to raves
Gonna get me a pizza, play it at the arcade

[Hook - Lyriq]
One day we together, the next we ain’t
Why you tryna drive me crazy, Daisy?
But it breaks my heart to say it’s over babe
But you got a nigga praying daily
Cause I don’t want to lose your love
I don’t want to lose your love
I don’t want to lose your love
I don’t want to lose your love

[Verse 2 - Mickey Factz]
Well fuck that and fuck you
Good luck getting home too
Don’t call me, don’t page me
Don’t do that shit, I don’t know you
Just leave, you ripped my heart out before
Please, really not tryna talk
But, really don’t want to lose you
So, keep going through the usual
Damn, my heart’s away in the urinal
With you pissing on it
What the hell did I do to you
And I was talking to Madonna, she told me karma’s a bitch
But what happens when you ain’t start it
Who the hell thought of this shit?
I told you to care for me, carefully
You said that you would be there for me
But I guess you lied, left me to die
With no clarity, that’s a rarity
I hate, hate, hate, the way that you stare at me like I’m charity
I want cake, cake, cake, and I don’t mean sarah lisa, come here to me
One day we together, and then we not
Driving me crazy, this should stop
Probably won’t, and I probably can’t get enough of you
Cause you hit that one spot

[Hook]
