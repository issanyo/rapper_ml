[Verse: Trice]
I tried it, I figured if it was somethin’ that I was s’possed to have I would have it
I walked away from love in hopes it would follow me to teach me
Then I realised I was walkin’ alone
Farewell to love, I hear you’re beautiful, simply amazing
Farewell to love, I probably never experience you
