[Intro: The Black Keys]
The look on the cake, it ain’t always the taste
My ex girl, she had such a beautiful face
I wanted love but not for myself
But for the girl so she could love herself

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Listen, my ex-chick’s raw, I had to put it to rest
I fuck crazy bitches though ’cause psycho pussy the best
Now shawty sending me texts, spaz and stress
Asking who I'm with and where I am and if I been smashing
I told her yes laughing, I don’t owe you
Baby, you will regret telling me that I don’t know you
The shit is over, you’re lying to get me over every week
It’s an emergency, I finna lose composure
How many times I done told you to just let go of it?
If home is where the heart is, you heartless so now you homeless
Lonely bitch, why you blowing up my phone again?
I killed your self esteem, I give your ego my condolences
Rolling with folks who only know you as a failure
When I met you, you showed your best parts, you like a trailer
And now I’m feeling like your ass done got the best of me
Making sure that your ass is nothing like my next to be

[Hook]
My next girl will be nothing like my ex girl
I made mistakes back then, I’ll never do it again
Oh my next girl, she'll be nothing like my ex girl
It was a painful death, I got a second chance

[Verse 2: Mickey Factz]
Here is a reminder dear, you was a recliner chair
Always trying to fall back from me, now you’re trying to appear
‘Cause you see vagina hairs all around my designer wear
You like "Mickey, please call back honey", funny
Nope, I dropped the dark phoenix, we wasn’t at all speaking
Blind as your ex-man, Cyclops, it was all seeing
You was my Jean Grey until you went psycho on me
Ghost writer ‘cause she was stereotyping for me
You think you know somebody till you see they true colors
Girls being Frankie Lymon, singing why do fools love us?
So for two Summers, she was a true blooder
Breaking my heart but I’m gonna get you sucker
Vampire slayer, can’t fly a prayer for this damn lying trader
Who didn’t stand by and make it work
I hate to jerk all my damn life, you damn right
Even though I fucked her and told her I loved her last night

[Hook]
