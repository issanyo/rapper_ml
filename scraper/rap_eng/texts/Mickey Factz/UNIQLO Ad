And we're back. That was Q(U), featuring Eryka Badu by Mickey Factz. I don't know if that was actually a featured record O.Minaya, but it sounded really good. What did you think about that record?

[DJ O.Minaya]
Definitely, definitely a hot record. The boy got talent man, I just hope he doesn't get sued for the sample

[Larry Love]
Yeah, yeah. I think he might have stole that. Anyway let's get to our sponsors. UNIQLO, rapology, allhiphop.com, A-list entertainment, DJ Booth.net, Hip-Hop since 1987 and goweird.com, they keep the lights on for us in this establishment and without them we would not be here. So, tonight we have Mickey Factz here shortly who is promoting his Red and Blue pill tour and we're going to be taking some callers as well. But first, we're going to get into these next records by Factz titled, She Got Me featuring Fly D'Antoni and then Frisbee featuring Mackie. Interesting title for a song, Frisbee. I-I don't get it

[DJ O.Minaya]
Well that's the way it is these days man. Um, you throw the love away and uh, sometimes it comes right back

[Larry Love]
That's the way love goes, you throw it.. I don't know what that means O.Minaya

[DJ O.Minaya]
Well you know, these days it's all about lust. You get what you want and then you're out the door. Just like that

[Larry Love]
You know, I-I don't know what you can possibly mean by that title but people will hear what Factz is talking about later on. We are going to pay some bills and after these next two records and then the Bronx MC should be up here. Again, this is Larry Love and..
