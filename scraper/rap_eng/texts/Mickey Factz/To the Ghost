{Verse 1: Leon Legacy]
And i'm the last man picked, dammit
Fuck it, no matter what happens imm'a be the last one standin'
Always claiming the hungry well mother fucker i'm famished
Starved like you'd think that i never heard of a sandwich
Damaged act like i never heard of a bandage
Brandish, each of these scars that i've been handed
Just understand its more than a normal persona could manage
And i ain't fell yet, mother fucker i don't plan it
'Cause i'm the kid that they said was never sufficient
I'm livin' to make a difference and wishin' for recognition
So kick it into ignition, the vision simply existed as a dream
That i manifested into a mission
And it seems, that every single day is like an obstacle
But progression has shown me anything is possible
I feel unstoppable i'm moving through the rumors
And blowing up like a tumor you're soon to learn is inoperable

[Chorus: Leon Legacy]
Headphones on, with my head in the clouds
I feel invisible, inside this town
So raise you glass, lets toast to the ghost
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though

[Post Chorus: Leon Legacy & Mickey Factz]
(see me though)
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though
(Promise you'll see me though)
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though

[Verse 2: Leon Legacy]
They out there waiting, watching to see me backtrack
Weight of the world on my shoulders inside a backpack
Dreaming of tour seeing all states and its sad that
They know i got drive but i couldn't afford the afflack
And imm'a get it i'm certain with the insurance
That i could survive a crash i know i got the endurance
Absurd as the road runner, run straight through the pitfalls or a brick wall
'Cause i paint a horizon thats picture perfect
The fire inside of my eyes is burning, yearning
Repressed passion is smashin' through to the surface
While workin' as if my life was a three ring circus
The curtains are drawn, so Leon, say you want it it's time to earn it
And i'm running out of patience, struggle to innovation
Hubble to in a station in space in this elevation imm'a make it
No other option but hell
I Promised the world, but most of all i promised my self (so lets go)

[Chorus: Leon Legacy]
Headphones on, with my head in the clouds
I feel invisible, inside this town
So raise you glass, lets toast to the ghost
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though

[Post Chorus: Leon Legacy & Mickey Factz]
(see me though)
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though
(Promise you'll see me though)
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]

Raise your glass put a toast in the air
For the most underrated, the folks better cheer
I'm the pope with the quotes thats dope for your ear
Needle in the headphones you can smoke what you hear
The culture is scared, the vultures appeared
But i got it on my back i'm the hulk if you stare
Real close if your vision isn't broke or impaired
It's so foggy in the east 'cause the coast isn't clear
The ghost that you fear, plasma from a rapper
Imagine casper actin' mad with a tantrum
Fathom the opera fantom with a mansion
Abandoned like ships thats stranded in Atlantis
Or Atlantic triangle Bermuda, fly angel of the future
Tryna make it a beautiful funeral for the humans thats dyin' over the music
Make sure martin Luther reciting reading my feuneral (Factz)

[Chorus: Leon Legacy]
Headphones on, with my head in the clouds
I feel invisible, inside this town
So raise you glass, lets toast to the ghost
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though

[Post Chorus: Leon Legacy & Mickey Factz]
(see me though)
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though
(Promise you'll see me though)
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though
I'm transparent someday i promise you'll see me though
