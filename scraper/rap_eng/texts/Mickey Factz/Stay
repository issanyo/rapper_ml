[Intro]
Hey it's Sarah London representing from Canada, I'm here with Larry Love and DJ Ominaya at W-LLL

[Hook]
Baby don't leave, please, please
Baby don't leave, please, please
I want you to stay, stay, with me
I want you to stay, stay, with me

[Verse 1]
Wait. Hey, where you going?
Where you going?
We just had a fight and you think about going?
Girl I'm in love you ain't even know it
Don't lie and act like I don't show it
I got a good thing I ain't gunna blow it
Bottle of Jack Ima sit here and poet
Write it all out, turn into a poet
Better then me going out just hoeing
Better yet, sit on the bed
Why you gotta sit on the edge?
What's going on, why your eyes red?
Tell me the truth you ain't gotta lie ??
It ain't that serious, don't tell me you're on your period
That was 2 weeks ago, so if you try to use that girl I ain't hearing it
What's your problem?
Why you went through my wallet?
Whillin', looking for a condom
I leave my phone out baby I don't like it
You could see everything
I told you girl you could be everything
I made a mistake but don't leave everything
If you do call if you need anything
Fuck that!
Where the trust at?
Make up sex, where the lust at?
Make up text, where the love at?
Make up breakfast, you want Factz
Water all in your face
Somebody daughter all in my face
Hate when she yell and talk out of place
I'd be wrong if I walked out the place
But ima stay, baby don't leave
Breaking up is what we don't need
Please - We a dope team
Geez, now I wanna smoke weed
And I don't blow trees
You remember Ashes
What I went through was madness
Those routines was a habit
I feel like a love like that

[Hook]
Baby don't leave, please, please
Baby don't leave, please, please
I want you to stay, stay, with me
I want you to stay, stay, with me

[Verse 2]
We love, we fight, break-up we might
There's a couple of people we see broke up that I don't ever wanna be like
Like Bobby and Whitney
Michael Jackson, Lisa Presely
Faith being married to Biggie
Even J.Lo dealing with Diddy
I was hurt for Mariah and Nick
On the fence about Rihanna and Chris
Now she got Drake inside of the mix
And I'm kinda let down by Tiny and Tip
I wanna be Will looking at Jada
Or Swizz when he's with Miss Keys
I ain't mad at Jay and Beyonce
But I don't wanna be Nas and Kelis
But this is about us, not about them
Even though I look up to Kanye and Kim
My heart was open and I let ya in
Now it's broke, going through the motions
Left in the ocean, you know I can't swim
Got on the phone and called all your friends
You bad mouthed me, why'd you do that girl?
That's lousy
There's two sides to a story
Read it, tell the story, repeat it
I'd be wrong if I told you I'm leaving
Or worse if I told you to beat it
That's wrong right?
We in for a long night
I wanna make it all right
Alright? Hear what i say?
Let's work it out
And I want you to stay

[Hook]
Baby don't leave, please, please
Baby don't leave, please, please
I want you to stay, stay, with me
I want you to stay, stay, with me
