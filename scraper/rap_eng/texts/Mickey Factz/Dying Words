[Hook 1: Linzi Jai]
In our dying words
Will we make the right decision
In our dying words
Will we say just how we feel
In our final hour
Will we be able to speak
To the ones we miss the most
For it's only god we seek
In our dying words

[Verse 1: QuESt]
Uh, I've spent a couple years searching
For something that was urgent, is this the ultimate purpose
Kicking my little raps (?) like fuck I'm the greatest
Wasn't being myself, I just reenacted my favorites
An adolescent, learning nothing lasted forever
But you can leave a legacy, fuck it I'll give it effort
These verses gave me a chance to believe in me
When all I saw was doubt around my city repeatedly
It's 2012 and all I know is my father's feeding me lies
I see it in his eyes, all he's trying to do is provide and I don't have the time
All I can do is focus and rhyme
My competition's winning, this isn't what I envisioned, dog
I need more, my lord, young and impatient
Don't wanna leave this world without reaching my destination
Excel ahead of the curb, huh
We all just want our voices being heard

[Hook 2: Linzi Jai]
In our dying words
Will we make the right decision
In our dying words
Will we say just how we feel
In our final hour
Will we be able to speak
To the ones we love the most
For it's only god we seek
In our dying words

[Verse 2: QuESt]
Uh, family matters I never got it, was dumb and rebellious
These are the times where I was careless
When niggas had me gassed, I was coming off of eleven grand
Discussions of signing would come into alignment
It's funny at seventeen, on the edge of your dream
I don't hold a chip on my shoulder, but fuck a Jermaine Dupri
It's amazing I see
Falling off of major proportions to figure out what's important
Me and my mother speak every day, the love is enormous
Progression from a time where arguments over money were cutting our family ties
She's, climbing a ladder of aging, that's why I'm slaving
I hope she understands that it's more than personal wagers
I hope she gets to see me be more than what she expected
Achieving everything that this visionary projected
Mother dearest, know that I murdered your last nerve
I promise you everything in the world
In our dying words

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: QuESt]
Uh, Throwing caution to wind
Now it's more than bargaining wins, I am targeted since
I had a check on my reality, plus it's like a salary
Really started fucking with my mentality
Time is waiting for no man
Here today, you're gone tomorrow
I start to question what I have to offer
What is a man if he can't provide for his fam
Doesn't signify who I am, but it plays a part in my insecurities
Plus the stresses keep luring me
Into places I never thought I would ever be
Sitting moving cleverly, sick of all of this jealousy
Making up excuses for why these niggas ahead of me
I really need to let it be
I'm going through something, my woman's touch is so heavenly
Reminds me why I fight for this shit
I live my life for this shit
In my lowest stages, I still become a favorite
Could have been with ballas, but she picked a struggling artist
Don't mind me I'm venting
I'm concerned with all of these worries
Twenty-three yeah I'm young, but I'm still in a fucking hurry
A young man's sport, gotta make it before you thirty
They getting younger and younger, nobody's truly deserving
It's real, I'm just giving you the truth in this song
Before I leave, David Copperfield, poof and be gone
I pray I do it all, everything that I deserve
Nothing less, as I take my last breath
In our dying words

[Hook 2]

[Outro: Mickey Factz]
I've been searching, searching, searching
I recall days, sitting in sun rays
Fourth grade while, park patrons played on swings
Slides, and with chess games I cried
Dreaming of better days
Who am I?
When my aunt passed I didn't even say goodbye
Because, I was so mad
A runaway, on his own path
Searching, searching, searching
Who am I?
Walking through K-Mart
Opening food without paying for it takes heart
No job, just, searching
Astronaut thoughts, basketball sports, practice law talk, rapping's my source, and yet
Who am I?
Being on a quest to search and find can take time
Parallel lines between him and I can't cause us to collide
Nor divide, but rather, coincide
Doubts and clout will sprout throughout our brains to our lungs then our mouths
As we announce then pronounce then shout, what we're about
With dreams of having our own land
Our own families
Our own house
While searching within to bring it all out
Who am I?
Am I me?
Am I you?
No, No
I am we, and I am Q
