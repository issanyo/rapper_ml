[Hook - Marsha Ambrosius]
Do it for the culture
For the grind, for the hustlers
Yeah I do it for the love of life
Its the life I'm living
I'm gonna keep, keep on winning
This time...

[Verse 1 - Mickey Factz]
It was all a dream
And I still ain't try to wake up
I used to read Billboard magazine
Now I'm on page one
I turned a good chance to a great one
So lets have a good dance to the bass drum
I still get love where I came from
If you think Hollywood, take one
LA sun, New York nights
Different city, same party, it's alright
Short days, long nights
We showing love if the drinks poured right
I'll die for the love of it
Please fill my cup to the top, not some of it
From the Bay to the LES this is our lifestyle
So we do it to the death

[Hook]

[Bridge - Mickey Factz]
Celebrate, drinks up
Dark for me, girls get the pink stuff
Never rewind how we used to live
I'm gonna remind you what the future is

[Verse 2 - Mickey Factz]
Lights, camera, action
Tonight's filled with magic
I'm living the movie, pick a scene
I got my eyes open, I'm in a dream
Cruising down the block, you can feel the breeze
Windows down baby I'm feeling clean
Hard work got a brother here
So we do this like every day's another year
Ball drop, the cork pop
Take your chance with me, and we can all rock
I'm Durant from 3, that's a sure shot
Cause I do this for the culture, off top
We celebrate just for grinding hard
Its all work cause this is my kind of job
I am looking at the finish line and its kinda far
That ain't nothing to a shining star

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Mickey Factz]
And that's exactly what I'm here for
Sprinkling my Diamond Dust all over your ear-ports
I just took off, I'm at the airport
So see me when you see me, cheer for him
I wanna hear claps
Screams, "encore," I wanna hear that
So when the brother land have the carpet ready
I got my shades on, go ahead toss confetti
