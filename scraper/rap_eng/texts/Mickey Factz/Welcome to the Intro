[Intro]

[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]
I don't want to sound like i'm hating
Expressing how i feel, and it sound like complaining
But i just want to feel like i'm bound for the greatest
Without being famous
Sounds like i'm Jaded
My lines go around y'all crowns like equators
Why am i still found by the ground like a crater
I don't know, but enough of the melody's
Rappers can't never touch what they never see
I'm stuck feeling empathy
What would i rather see
I'm getting crushed by the lust of my enemies
Trusting my energy
Hand on her butt while im clutching my Hennessy
At the Grammy's feeling like im nothing ill never be (Yay!)
But this rush is so heavenly, think about it
Freddy Krueger chase me when I dream about it
I had a buzz but, i ain't want to be around it
Just wanted a female bush i can beat around in
King of talent but you see i'm doubted
My ego's low, but they think its cloudy
Im drinking from a fountain, whats the meaning bout it
Hope is full of youth and full of truth
Pen write it out bullet points on bullet proof
Laying up with a girl just like i couldn't shoot
Which means i'm never outside like a music booth
I'm just hip to the motions like a hula hoop
I'm wondering where life should go
On the microphone
I'm a titan or a giant clone
Think about Goliath or a lichen when i'm tryna flow
Soon i'ma be he king sitting on the nicest throne (Factz)

[Verse 2: Deeq Sheikhali)

Im coming live from my mother fuckin' city
The same place where nobody was fucking with me
Used to, stay my ass writing in my mama house
Now a nigga bout to blow and everybody riding with me
Had a teacher back in school who said i wouldn't even make it
Told me i wasn't shit and that my life would end up wasted
It's all good i'm already used to being hated
Cause these rappers from my city killed the scene, i just saved it
Now a nigga with a dream, finna blow up one day
Don't worry mama ill be good i know you out there hoping
That i will make it soon, the road im on is only one way
Now watch this money inflate, ill be somebody some day
I never stopped working man i'm on a day to day
Word from my brother, had a fan out in Sante Fe
He said that my words hit home and said that he can relate
And plus he told i'm the one, bottom right to escape
Oh dear
Oh dear, oh dear
Man i'm rapping like i got the fuckin' verse of the year
I got the people sleeping on me talking about my career
On how my flow can be so sick, its like i rap with no cure
I'm getting tired of the cops and all the body's they collapsing
Fuck you to the pigs, swine flu is what they catching
All they do is talk about how they're here to protect
Man police out here living foul, somebody call in a tech
I'm trynna catch flame, like my name fired up
I told these niggas i ain't kidding like they tubes tied up
I got the upper hand even if its 2 on one
Boy i'm telling you rap niggas step it up or you done
Nigga


[Outro]
Step it up or ya done
I'm telling wack niggas step it or ya done
Man, and we ain't playing no games
Yall claim to be Soulja and i ain't sayin no names

Welcome to my head man, aye Mickey we got one nigga!
