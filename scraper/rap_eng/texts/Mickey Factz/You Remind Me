[Intro - Factz]
You know
You got me feeling like a caveman girl
Hah
So I know this girl nah, wait
You see
I saw this billboard
And it reminded me of you

[Verse 1]
I got a crush on the finest chick
Shes the girl I've been trying to get
So I ask her what time is it
Just to hear her acknowledge it
I be, I be stalking her
Not really, I just want to talk to her
Trying to get to know her
And walk with her
But right now to her, I'm a foreigner
See, it's kind of weird cause she reminds me
Of another girl that used to like me
Broke up with her cause shes a pisces
Yeah I'm a cancer but things are shiesty
Now I got a feeling that shorty might be
My new best friend and my wifey
Us being together we so icy
Cause she reminds
She reminds me
Of you

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go
There's always something to remind me
Of another place in time
Where love that travelled far had found me

Ha-ha, ha-ha

Everywhere I go
There's always something to remind me
Of another place in time
Where love that travelled far had found me
Look, look

[Verse 2]
So we together and things is cool
Always thinking of thing to do
It reminds me of being with you
Kind of crazy I think of you
Holding hands, and slow dancin, romancin
You come to mine I don't plan it
Get lost get the picture
I swear
When I kiss her I envision
I daydream everyday, man
You my lady and I'm your caveman
When I'm with somebody
At the same time though I miss somebody
I swear though this isn't like me
Cause she reminds me
She reminds me
Of you

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go (oh everywhere I go)
There's always something to remind me (always something)
Of another place in time (you and me baby)
Where love that travelled far had found me (so far)

Everywhere I go (everywhere I go)
There's always something to remind me (always something to remind me)
Of another place in time (another place in time)
Where love that travelled far had found me (so far)

Everywhere I go you remind me
