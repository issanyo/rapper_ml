My mind got blown

Verse 1:
When I was a child, I thought like a child
Then I got a little bit older
Look at me now got a whole lot of style
Tryna take the world over
Me, I’ve got so many plans
Multi-tech I’ve got so many hands
Going for the number one spot at the top
Ironic, online with so many fans, Classic
The things I see through my glasses
It’s not the same as the masses
I’ve got the game on the mattress
Having mad sex, not past tense
I am the future and that’s it
I will not lose, in my bracket
If imma shoot at the basket, imma cash it
Keep singing

Hook:
Somewhere along the way, my mind got blown away
So on my lonely days, I just can’t tend to stay
Im gone
My mind got blown away, I’m gone
Away, I’m gone. X2
My mind got blown away, I’m gone x2, So long

Verse 2:
Where I come from, it’s hard to breathe
Pollution and heat is stuck in the air
Sometimes is hard to see, illusion to fate
We stuck in the glare
That’s why for me, it ain’t hard to dream
No matter how hard it seems
My heart believes, in a holy dream
I might wake up in a horror scene
My life takes off when tomorrow leaves
And I race off, in the morning breeze (x3)
I can’t take off, I need all the cheese
See, see, right now, watch that
Meet me in the car, with the top back
Think of a star, when I rap
People are Fords, but not fast
As, as time went on
Looked in the mirror and I got grown
Felt like a man, when I got home
Alone, too soon and you
What I came with, is something I can keep retaining
Is something, that I leave remaining (x2)
Keeps me saying

Hook:
Somewhere along the way, my mind got blown away
So on my lonely days, I just can’t tend to stay. I just can't tend (whisper)
My mind got blown
I said it because, I meant it
I meant it, because I said it
I said it, because I’m living, I’m living
My mind got blown

Verse 3:
I said it because, I meant it
I meant it, because I said it
I said it, because I’m living, I’m living
My mind got blown
Where it at, I can’t find it
Help me get it back (x2)
The lost and found
The talk of the town, that’s talking now
I’m talking bout my aura now, get all around
So high, I wanna get on the ground
I’m on the cloud, I’m on it now, Somewhere

Hook:
Somewhere along the way, my mind got blown away
So on my lonely days, I just can’t tend to stay. Just can’t tend to stay
My mind got blown
My mind got blown away, Blown away
Away, blown away
Away, my mind got blown
My mind got blown away, blown away
Away, blown away
Away, my mind got blown
