[Verse - Mickey]
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bumble bee
Can't back down, success is right in front of me
Utterly the best, these cats are under me
Got no guests, still I got companies
Got chicks bugging me, sorry ma gotta go
Adios, binoculars on for the pot of gold
Mad clothes, stopped shopping a long time ago
Throwing dough in the air like I work for Dominoes
Bank account trying to get mad zeroes
Hanging out with Trav from the Gym Class Heroes
Now I got fans in Thailand
Outta arms length when I did Arms Race with the rock band

Since I worked with Wayne and Kanye
All the dames been giving me brain to Sade
I'm a giant trying to change my name to Andre
No games, I'm a go get a plane in Bombay

Learned my roots, I burn the booth
I'm the male version of Sojourner Truth
I do this for y'all, my words can boost
The minorities to reverse the noose you can't lynch me
You ain't gotta convince me
I'm having the same dream as Martin, don't pinch me
You can't bench me, I'm still in the game
Mickey Jordan on a frenzy, killing the lane

I'm about to crash the market
All in the scope of Assassin's targets
Flashback was awesome
A million fish in the sea, come to me if you want to hear a rapping dolphin
Right now im feeling like Aladdin soaring
On a magic carpet with the Pharaoh's daughter
In a Whole New World I'm a master talking
Trying to get buried in a Platinum coffin

Is it wrong for these girls to have abortions
If they saved the life of a bastard orphan (hmm...)
With that being said, thank you Loretta for not killing your eggs
Can't get mad when you say get a job
She don't know she about to be living large
She's gonna get a crib bigger than the pentagon
With a new church that's bigger than a synagogue

Cream
Straight from Minotaur
Walk in, make a Star Scream like Megatron (ahhh!!!)
Yes I'm a real threat
Walk red carpets with no deal yet
One half of my life is just like real sex
The other half is me getting real fresh
Closet full of shit that I ain't wear yet
So I'm gonna do me til ain't no air left (haaa)

Now that that's outta my system
I want all of y'all to listen
Nothing against Hilary Clinton
But Obama's about to be winning
I respect his message
I hope he gets the best protection during the next election but
I hope I never get arrested
I hope I ain't the kid the pigs selecting

I can't imagine how cuffs be on
I don't even put cuff links on, I swear somethings wrong
The game's crowded, everybody's a rapper
I feel like Waldo with a rugby on
Come find me, don't confine me
I'm like a caveman, why they gotta remind me?

I really guess cause they hate I'm here
So I take pride when they say I'm weird
Cause once they get a whiff and my name out there
They're gonna say "What a great idea" yea
I know they dis me but
I don't care if they go against me
I need to get dough to get me past Oprah Winfrey
Til then, please don't forget me
These type of songs that I'm writing for
Get felt like cyberporn on Microsoft
(boop, boop, boop) Making sure the mic is on
If not, let's rewind the song

[Best The Am I x4]

Float like a butterfly
Sting like a bumblebee
Don't tell me what you got or what you're gonna be
Don't tell me that you're hot when you're summer's eve
You belong in some female Dungarees

Fuckface, your mouth needs some duct tape
Blood full of Kool-Aid, heart made of cupcakes
I'm in the back with a Barbie heifer
Cigar in my mouth, Maserati stretcher
PRPS and Nakazi sweater
Garbus wristwatch and the Fonzi leather
The girl that I'm with, I probably drenched her
And if you saw her, you'd probably sweat her

I bone chicks with hips and dope tits so
If you know any girls that don't bitch dont
Give a damn and they don't throw fits then
They can sit on top of my gold dick (Gold Dick?)
That's right I have a gold dick
It'll make a stomach light when it goes stiff
I ain't fiending for a deal, I just want more chips
They send in cards for a deal, so go fish

Why is it that there's people so rich when
We have a population homeless, shit
They won't keep me under
Cause I use the eyes of Stevie Wonder

In my Key of life I can't forget Saint
We won't ever fall off like some champagne
Me and Steve argue just to get shit straight
He listens cause he thinks I spit great
My man Nakim, me and him be wilding
And without Kwas I would not be styling
P-P-P-Precise, give me one year trust me
I guarantee that our life will be comfy

Get in or leave, or please just keep snoring
Shit's about to really change or transform

GFC is in a war, get ready for Vietnam
