[Verse 1]
Right now the times is hard
Pay is getting lower
It's hard to fing a job
Nights is getting colder

I'm inspired by my dreams
Whenever I'm sleeping, homie
Every dollar I receive
I'm just tryina keep it on me

I'm been here, I'm been there
I see good, I see clear
I think well, I think (?)
And that means I'm aware

[Hook 1]
What I wear, what I drive
What I make, what I buy
Where I work, where I grind
It's (my-my) my life

(My-my) My life
(My-my) My life
(My-my) My life
(My-my) My life

[Verse 2]
It's hard to bring the (?)
Sorrows not forever
Even the things get tough
Tomorrow's looking better

I'm achievement what I working for every single day
I'm believing me in further (???) my way

When I look at my past
Too good, too bad
What I give, what I have
How I live, how I act

[Hook 2]
What I do, what I rhyme
It's all me, It's my mind
Where I work, where I grind
It's (my-my) my life

(My-my) My life
(My-my) My life
(My-my) My life
(My-my) My life

[Verse 3]
Feel I do it well (yeah)
Ready for heaven
Cause I've been to hell
Learning my lessons (???)

Taking my essence and feel what I felt
I have a presents that people (???)

It's real
What I know, what I feel
What I learn, I apply
To my days and my nights

[Hook 1]
What I wear, what I drive
What I make, what I buy
Where I work, where I grind
It's (my-my) my life

(My-my) My life
(My-my) My life
(My-my) My life
(My-my) My life
