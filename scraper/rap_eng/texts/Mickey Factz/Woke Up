[Intro]

[Verse 1: Kdita Otaku]
Yeah, grown man talk, don't interrupt
Nigga with the old mind, cussin' in a tux
Charm on the chain, but he never seen luck
Living in an old mind, mind so corrupt
He never seen joy, so he doesn't feel pain
And never seen peace, unaware of the insane
He would've been lost, but I found him in the mirror
Full of dirty visions, so I left to see it clearer
Yeah, but I'm back up in the game
Still the samurai, and I'm living it the same
Still cold blooded, with the same name
A little more success, still flirting with the fame
But it's strange, caught up in the pain
Hurting in the day, but the night is so insane
Man, will it ever stop? I pray to my religion
And the nights are getting tough
But I swear I got a vision and It goes like this...

[Hook: Kdita Otaku]
I woke up from a dream
That I had last night
Ay, I was in this place
Where everything was alright
And we ain't feel pain, and ain't nobody stress ya
And if they try to run up on ya then it's God bless ya
Cause we about to get it, can you feel it in the air?
Ay, I just had a vision that I'm bout to be there said
We ain't feel pain, and ain't nobody stress ya
And if they try to run up on ya then it's God bless ya
Cause we about to get it, can you feel it in the air?
Ay, I just had a vision that I'm bout to be there
Said, whatchu gonna do?
When the times get hard and at night, you just feel like you alone
Do you ride? Fall?
Fly? Stand tall?

[Verse 2: Mickey Factz]
Nightmares of a dreamer
They say life's rare, I'm aware as a breather
They say fight fair, but I swear I see cheetahs
So until white hair might appear, I'mma leader
Every lightyear, my aura is Times Square
Bright glare, so I get slight stares as a speaker
Wings on my back, I'm an archangel
I even dream when I rap, call me Clark Gabel
Headed to the Barbados, never return
Instinct is in sync, remember to learn
I'm so hot now, if it's December I burn
And friends emerge when success on the verge
Alone with my peeps, don't hope to convince me
Daydreaming while I sleep, don't even pinch me
Stand tall like a giant in a dwarf land
With my long hand pointing toward what I call grand

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Man don't fear, other man
No man fear, what man see in the mirror

[Hook]
