[Verse 1]
I figured I’d write this while you asleep
You’re my dream girl and I love what you do to me
Heaven been whispering to me that you’re for me
Sparks in the air you would swear it was jubilee
That’s an anniversary
You’re like the planet Mercury
Cuz you’re the one I want closest to my sun
After we plan a nursery
No arguments
Through the up with this I hold your hand like a partnership
No parlor tricks no hidden message
No disrespecting no ditsy exes
Just the essence like Cupid find
You and I it’s a blessing
Search for the perfect things I could never say
It’s like every day is a better day
Until our wedding day
Let us pray

[Chorus]
You have all of my heart
Heaven’s whisper
You’re the one that I want
And I listen

[Verse 2]
Ever heard a whisper from heaven
Can you tell me what it sound like
Have you ever had a glimpse into heaven
Well that’s what it smelled like
Go call her that I’m the coach she the quarterback
Same thing
Yeah we all of that
Damn hadn’t thought of that
Thought of you
[?]
Can’t wait for the burlesque
Can’t wait till you work less
Whatever it takes to make sure you’re happy
I measure that length and then go the distance to get to the place
Forever is great

[Chorus]
You have all of my heart
Heaven’s whisper
You’re the one that I want
And I listen
Climb the highest mountain
Tell the eagle not to fly
Erase all of the universe
Before I ever say goodbye

[Outro]
I figured I’d write this while you asleep [x2]
Heaven’s whisper
I figured I’d write this while you asleep [x2]
Heaven’s whisper
