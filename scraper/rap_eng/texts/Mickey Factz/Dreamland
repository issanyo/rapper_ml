Dreamland

Mickey.... Factz
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh

Life, tell me what it is about
Trying to figure it out
I Have so many doubts, it feels like I’m sleeping (sleeping, sleeping)
Cuz I don’t believe it (believe it, believe it)

[Chorus]
I’m caught in a Dreamland (4x)
(“Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh (3x)
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh”)
I’m caught in a Dream....

[Verse 1]
I’ve been down, never thought I could turn it around
When I feel like I was all messed up, stuck in the water, trying not to drown
I had to pull myself out of the tide (tide, tide)
That’s when I felt I was alive (alive, alive)
I never really died
Just felt like Life, wasn’t what it was it the right light, then I caught a buzz and I couldn’t get enough of the limelight
So I kept up as I tried to fight for my Freedom (Freedom, freedom)
These are the thoughts of My mind’s Museum (museum)
But do I really need them?
I don’t never know, so, I live life like a real-life photo
You know,so I just zone
Cuz I’m still  here, even though, I should be gone, and I feel weird but I love it, that’s my mode, so leave me alone, just leave me alone

[Bridge]
I love it, I swear I love it, i know you know u love it, I swear I love it, it feels like I’m sleeping (it feels like I’m sleeping), I can’t believe it (I can’t believe it)

[Chorus]
I’m caught in a Dreamland (4x)
(“Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh (3x)
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh”)
I’m caught in a Dream....

[Verse 2]
What you see, I need to tell me what you see, cuz I tell you what comes to me, and soon as I wake up cuz I like to dream about, Damn...
Need to remember what I dream about
Man...
I can’t understand. I gotta I figure out, what’s all about, so I just wonder how to work it out, can’t go under gotta climb out
From the depths of my slumber, when I’m knocked out. In a drought, and I WILL...(I will.., I will..)
I’m so en vogued, I’m giving you what I feel
And that’s so Real, can’t be fake, wait
Those things never equate to (me?)
Y’all know the deal cuz I dealt them
And I know you felt it, cuz I feel it too
The difference is that, I feel is true
And if you don’t, then I feel for you
And if you won’t, then I’ll leave you alone
And remain in MY Zone, whoa

[Bridge]
I love it, I swear I love it
I know you know I love it, I swear I love it
It feels like I’m sleeping (it feels like I’m sleeping), cuz I can’t believe it (I can’t believe it)

[Chorus]
I’m caught in a Dreamland (4x)
(“Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh (3x)
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh”)
I’m caught in a Dream....

I don’t want to wake up from what I am seeing
This is what I want, I know that I mean it
Following My dreams
And take me where I need to go, oh

[Chorus]
I’m caught in a Dreamland (4x)
(“Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh (3x)
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh oohhh”)
I’m caught in a Dream....

I’ve been down, never thought I could turn it around
When I feel like I was all messed up, stuck in the water, trying not to drown
I had to pull myself out of the tide (tide, tide)
That’s when I felt I was alive (alive, alive)
