[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Hook]
Ripping my heart was so easy... So easy
Launch your assault now... Take it easy
Ripping my heart was so easy... So easy
Launch your assault now... Take it easy

[Verse 1]
Yeeeea
I been in love one time too many
And I seen what it did to me & my heart
So ain't nothing nobody can tell me
That I know already
Right from the start
Fight to stay strong
I'm in the dark while the light remains on
Do it for the love I might be Faizon
Might be Faizon
Wifey ain't gone
Yet
When she walk out the door, next
I hope that my heart, gets
A bulletproof vest
Aim at my chest, put me to rest

[Hook]
Ripping my heart was so easy... So easy
Launch your assault now... Take it easy
Ripping my heart was so easy... So easy
Launch your assault now... Take it easy

[Verse 2]
Uh
Just when I thought my world was all over
I meet somebody just like you
Before you know it her feelings get closer
And I barely know her
And it's not you
What did I do
Who have I drawn
What have I drew
Watch my hand the brush that I move
What can I say
What can I prove?
I'm still hurt
4 letter word, I'm still cursed
I feel worse, shoulda left it
When you took my heart you shoulda kept it

[Hook]
Ripping my heart was so easy... So easy
Launch your assault now... Take it easy
Ripping my heart was so easy... So easy
Launch your assault now... Take it easy

[Bridge]
How does it feel now... To watch it burn!!!

[Verse 3]
She raised her weapons and the bitch just aimed it
She don't know that that's dangerous
And while I'm going through these changes
Painless, but I feel that
Banana clip that she peeled back
She Missed her target and still clapped
Hit me right where my shield at
And I still act like she ain't mean to
I swear I just can't believe you
But what goes around is gon come around
I can't wait till somebody leave you
Seen you, on 5th street
2nd Ave, all discreet
In front of the mural that Keith did
For you & I right where we live
Up the block, you bust a shot, like fuck the cops
Bystanders, looking around, wondering why that gun went pop
Now I'm lying there, with this chalk around me
I'm just dying here, blood from my heart around me
That's heart attack
Meanwhile I'm falling flat
Where the cops at when you need em
Arrested for cardiac
Lock her up
No phone call, I won't call her back
I won't write the bitch, no autograph
I don't like the bitch & tell the warden that
I hate her!!!

[Hook]
Ripping my heart was so easy... So easy
Launch your assault now... Take it easy
