[Verse 1: A-live]

Down on my last dollar, god damn I better blow
Working harder ‘cause second place I can’t settle for
The will to win is the shit they give out medals for
Never fazed by the pain, this I was destined for
While you were out here partying, me and Ren were arguing
About album release dates, promotions and the marketing
My girl calling my phone but I can’t seem to answer it
Cause she don’t understand how the stress can get so damaging
Gave my mom more grief than I would prefer
But now she smile when my Beamer pull up to the curb
I did it ma, I made it ma, and I’m still your son
But now the pressure on ‘cause they saying I’m the one
So close I can taste it, a couple hours from greatness
A quiet kid but for the cash, I’m murdering like Mase did
Praying that we make it, but I don’t want to be famous
Living in my moment, I’m knowing we gonna take this

[Chorus: Anik Khan]

What we talking about, huh?
If it ain’t about paper, get from around us
Cause patience ain’t a virtue where we from bruh
It’s now or never so you better understand
We do this here by any means

[Verse 2: Mickey Factz]

Up and down, roller coaster this is what I’ve been through
Label after label, see the bullshit I get into
Never had a thought when I was 12 and had a pencil
Writing to an instrumental, I get paid off my mental
But I did it, I did it, and I’m still trying to get closer
I’m winning, I’m winning and I can’t stop till it’s over
Got a niece now that I’m proud of, get emotional when I hold her
Probably wouldn’t be rapping about 5 months ago if I didn’t know her
But I do, so that’s one plus one equals two
I added Q to that equation and my hunger really grew
Got doubted by some people that I thought I really knew
That ain’t nothing really new, hope you got a clearer view
‘Cause I’m Malcolm at window by any means
Martin while he marching, sleepwalking with many dreams
Michael Jackson, microphone magic in my Billie Jean
Set myself a goal and I’mma do it when I hit the scene, feeling me?

[Verse 3: Soupa]

Yo I'm tryna make a buck/
If I'm asleep then wake me up/
Im on the field that's on the real no time to chill n wait for luck/
Without a whip, I'll take the bus/
Miss the bus, I'll take a hike/
My foes be tryna take me light/
Shorties tryna spend the night/
But I been in my basement on probation/
I done harbored so much hatred, felt like god had left me fatherless and faded/
Now I'm off 40 ounce, stumble thru the city/
When you black and out of order don't nobody show you pity/
But I been a goon
A silver spoon is something I ain't used to
All the grindings made me coocoo, missing times that we would shoot hoops/
Now I can't tell who's who , my homie faded poppin pills, it's hard to chill/
I can't explain the pain I'm not no doctor Phil/
Sittin Replaying our lives like we were watching film/
I'm grown now lets play a little game it's called do not killed/
And I got the will to win, it's something that I feel within/
Hustle hard lets get it in, hustle hard lets get it in
