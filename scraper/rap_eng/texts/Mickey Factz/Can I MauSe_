MauSe...

[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]

Brick walls to a white back drop
Taggin' on the back block, flattop
I'm duckin' the Matlock
Tight leads, listen to Ice-T
He rapped hot, he colored cannes with fat tops
Crack rock, residue was so visible that it had cops involved
They were pushing rag tops with fat knots
I'm a paint a slash photographer
I snap shots
