People asking where I've been at
Had to see the world and put food where my fridge at
Tours all over the place, brother I did that
When I was a little cat, didn't want a car
Used to look at skyscrapers like "that's where I'mma live at"
I dreamed this, can you believe this?
It's so surreal how I'm living my achievement
It's 3 AM riding slow in my V6
Thinking why the hell it took so long to release shit?
Left turn, lanes start forming
Hit a red light as the rain started pouring
Open the sunroof, let the water come through
Leather getting wet, I don't care, cause it's just you
That's what the mirror say, I could be gone tomorrow
But since I'm here today, you're gonna hear me say
I'm changing, that ain't really fun
Change is good, though, ask any bum
Ask Obama, that was his campaign
All I'mma do is give you my last name
I'm losing friends for pursuing my career
When the music ends, will they truly be here?
I do pretend if I'll make it through the year
We can be cool again before a funeral appears
The beautifullest smear when the eulogy is near
Cause when they die, you talk them through the air
Annabel, I wish that you was here
I didn't see you go, cause I knew it wasn't fear
I go to church every week, looking stupid in the chair
Cause I'm taking enough space, I be waking up late
Walking in like I own that placing my faith in the grave
Next to you, I'm crazy like Mas-on Betha
Under mad pressure
Me and God ain't talk, cause I'm scared of the lecture
Now my mom is happy I'm not bummy
I'm on, so I automatically got money
Now she attached to me, she's stressing me out
Ayo, Jay this what success is about?
Wrestling doubt, call me Hulk Hogan with this dope flowing
They all hoping I'll drop, but I don't know owing
I got too much heart for them to bypass
Can't be touched, I ain't a iPad
My feet talk to the concrete every morning
I run the streets, doing push-ups on every corner
They think I'm lazy cause my content got smaller
When I've gone farther than my father, why bother?
I was touring, recording and interviewing
But to my fans I was interluding
Typical long day, leave me alone, mang
Even right now, I'm invisible on AIM
Ducking people, tired of trusting people
Damn near had enough of people, vice versa
I felt like a funny-style groupie
Came to her, threw the word "love" around loosely
Four-letter verb had her strut around droopy
I fuck around usually, it's nothing now to me
I shut it now truthfully cause
Cause I want a a wild cutie with a subtle round booty
But it's something about beauty it lasts for a little bit
Cause if the chick dumb, not even good brain could fix the shit
Lately I want a baby, that's crazy
Maybe I'm a three-legged chair, my thoughts shaky
So I get the box then I simply watch
Me pulling out quicker than a New York City cop
Deep shit, I don't sleep, kid
Cause some of y'all think my word don't mean shit
I put on these Y-3 kicks, cruise around 96
Straight with my leased whip
Looking at the skyscrapers
Upperwest-side chaser, you can't stop my grind, player
Changed the cover of this mixtape
Almost changed the title but I can't be rivalled
That's that, scratch that, that's Factz
Soon y'all gon' be downloading the Black App
Me and my pops made up for his last act
I'm his Kid, but I don't Play, I ain't a Class Act
Team player, trying to win Steve Nash rap
If you don't assist, then I'm past that
Got my eyes to the heavens watching birds skateboard
On the clouds, like the legend Tony Hawk when he skidding
Aiming for the top of the building while I'm living
I'mma get it; I'm moving on, I'm moving on
I did this, I did that, still doing more
Battered soul, what the fuck, I been through it all
When the things gonna change? Talk to me, y'all
Trying to get a skyscraper
Dying to get a skyscraper
Got both of my eyes on a skyscraper
I'mma get it, skyscraper
