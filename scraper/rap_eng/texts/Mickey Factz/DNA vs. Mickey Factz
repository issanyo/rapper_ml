[Round 1: DNA]
Said there's nowhere to escape now bitch
Soon as they said we was gonna do this on Volume 3 everybody started havin’ panic attacks
And I just feel like I got demoted
Now he havin' cold sweats, his walls closin' in cause he can’t get a top opponent
So I'ma make my foe be a (phobia) bitch in this small room, now he claustrophobic
I'm 'bout that
They knowin' I'ma lead, to URL I'm the house cat
And the moment Smack rode in with the cheese, it got Mause (mouse) trapped
You 'bout to tell us that you not the snitch but who’s the snitch
That’s still snitchin', that doesn’t sound tough
Cause real niggas in the buildin' know, when you get charged with somethin' you supposed to take the rap and keep your mouth shut
Now y'all ain’t remember when Raekwon snuffed Joe Buddens and he almost dropped to the ground
Well that pertains to our situation and y'all gotta know now
Cause every time I asked to battle he would say Yung Ill washed me
Like you wasn't the nigga that tried to plot on my round
So just like Joe on live chat you tried to cover it with Ice pack for this not (knot) to go down
But now we here
Cool and I got the first witness
And now ya lives endin' for tryin' to butt in (Budden) to Disney business
It's too late to revoke, I got nothin' but hate for this vulture
And the beam on the side of Mause (mouse) gonna change the state of the culture
Picture his childhood, Bronx blocks
Hustlers sellin' coke and dope
And there go little Mark Williams
Starin' at the Stop Snitchin' poster slow
You wasn't supposed to say jack but the more he aged he forgot how it's supposed to go
What I'm tryin' to say is
Before mine tell (Montel) Williams they'll let the host a (holster) show
Commercial break, y'all remember when Honda had this nigga dancin' and rappin' awkwardly?
The cameras come on, all his friends like, "I remember when Factz supported me."
His baby like, "Baby let's go for a walk."
You like, "Hmph. That's insulting me."
So they took away the Accord to make you act accordingly
Told his parents, "Wait 'til you see our V."
I'm like, "He gotta embellish it."
But once you let your bills pile it (Pilot) only took one eye to see (Odyssey) that you outta your Element
It ain't no secret, maybe they let you lease it
Well I'm done clowin' this bitch
And since you ain't own the Car, Factz (Carfax), well I ain't get the run down on a whip
Damn homie, when you was on that Freshman cover you was the man homie
What the fuck happened to you?
See it takes rounds to break down why we ain't seen this nigga from the X excel (XXL)
Was it cause he dropped a bunch of mixtapes and got no reviews?
Nah, it's cause when you turned the page, the issue at hand is you couldn't Show & Prove
We all seen you mixtapes, but in battle rap you a rookie
And I don't got respect for suckers
New Glock? Nah, I just give his class an old .9 ('09), I got this Freshman covered
Your currency (Curren$y) was low, cause Corey had a mili and you wanted a piece of that
Asher Roth ran them colleges, Blu puttin' you on tour was a decent act
You and Cudi's career? Day and night ('Day N' Nite')
Ace Hood 'Hustle Hard' just to see a plaque
And you know all this shit the truth, pay attention while I'm speakin' Factz
Factz, ya industry career, all lost dreams
Factz, you made a song that said your bank account had 414
Factz, I know you wish you could've saw more green
And now it's your turn to pass, but it ain't magic when many ring
And then my crew all bang, and then it's New York slang
I'm gettin' "facts" after everything
You made a mistake with Danja, don't let them bloggers hype ya skills
And now you tryin' to make a come back off your last error (era)
You spent too much time with Millz
You wanna fight? Swing on me? Oh you gon' die for real
But before he can die Jive dropped him like when he signed the deal
It's one murder case, all it takes to shine the kill
That means I make my blood circulate and let the iron peel
They tryin' to force the truth about me about what happened to his body
Cause when they find it, ill, cause the only thing they seen was Factz' remains, and he's lying, still
The only seen half of the Factz like they ain't get it all it together
After the Fact, the culture gon' be mourning forever
Matter of fact, I shoot out the brain matter of Factz
And now we gatherin' Factz I think I got my story together
You went from King Of The Dot to URL
Beasley told me you would switch your plan of attack
So of course you gonna try to get Gully with Eric
But it's just not Organik to Smack
Everybody say "Mickey's too lyrical" but this room is evidence that I'm damagin' that
Cause their whole case changed once DNA tampered with Factz
You gon' see if It's Dark And Hell Is Hot when you sittin' in the morgue
Aye, they asked me 'How It's Goin' Down', now you know, I'm grippin' on a .4
See these 'Niggas Done Started Something' when they picked me for this war
Now see what this nigga from the X get?
Soon as I hear, "It's me, 'Mickey'" at the door
Aye Mickey how could you doubt and belittle me?
If I give him a shell then I'll put him outta his misery
This is World War One, cause this amounting to victory
And if these bullets are the Factz (artifacts) then you about to be history
Smack is bald, Verb is vegan...and this camera is black
And if y'all was confused what I was doin' I just gave y'all an example of facts

[Round 1: Mickey Factz]
You been saying my name for 7 years, and got ignored like a bitch call
Fuck your false flagging, handicapped, gang bangin' mother, nobody cares if the Crip walk
Beasley called me for you, I said "Whats the point, I'll pass." Dish off more than Chris Paul
I'm surprised you made it this far, since you and K Shine share a Zip car
He gon' have a bunch of name flips y'all, but I ain't pissed off
This punishment capitol, thought we was in North Dakota how the fans was saying, "Handle ya Biz Mark (Bismark)!"
But don't say he's 'Just A Friend', lets pretend, he a big boss
I'll tase you, till you start leakin' fluid pussy, ain't no beatin' this charge (discharge)
Nevertheless, this footage will show, I give that grim hoodie feel
Your Ascension is next...and the reaper (Reepah) done got booked for real
Beasley paid me to be a Hitman, so I took the deal
After I Showout with these punches, which Eric gon' foot the bill?
Chill, nervous student
He bit off more than he can chew with my pen, I'ma mean lyricist
He just seem intricate
Y'all give em plates, well I'ma hook em up to IV since he feed into it
Emotional, cause if he start freestyle rebuttallin' and don't sense the crowd loving it
He'll prolly quit, like he did with Emine... my bad for bringing it up, that was foul (Fowl) wasn't it?
Lay em out, then put hands and feet on em, fuck a massage room
Beasley said you ready for Eric B? Long as I'm Paid In Full, I'ma 'Pump Up The Volume'
Then he said, "Wait, you bodied Daylyt so over there, so over here you can't do bad."
Well shit, I'm James Brown and he my son and 'Poppa's Gotta A Brand New Bag'
Okay, you let your let machete spray, I get it, cause some rifles gotta blade on it
But when a fan recite it, they look stupid and get blamed for it
6 shooter, and each bullet got ya name on it
Forensics find em with no ID, but knew it was you, cause the shells had DNA on it
When you hit 18, we let you rock, we'd figure you would grow up with ya bars
But after 21 jack, all bets was off when you showed up on the card
Roll up with ya squad, i want smoke, came close but no cigar
You a wretch calling me a clown is a gag, well if I'm it, why you throw up on the job
Smack, he tried to one upchuck, hoping for extra life, but he seeing death
Be my guest, Disney bars, he was gassed on this platform, fire from my hands will heat ya head
This prince rose to clock his face, give this Beast respect
Every word good, I emerge to purge, I got your nerves shook
You battled Nu Jeruz to push Twork?
I'm tryna say shit to get a Twork push
Go in the mirror, I want you to tell me how the dirt look
And niggas want you to stop with the Jerseys
Like right when we bout to see Surf cook
Lemme bring that line back in
Ray Lewis jersey, for 52 weeks you been raving (Raven) 'bout this rhyme action
I'm drunk, tryin' to throw him over a boat, telling the cops, "We just kayaking."
Wait... you was smoking puttin' this outfit on... thinking it's high fashion
Who dressed you? Lemme guess...you
I can tell you did it, I would be helpful and help you with it
But....I really can't help you niglet
Plus I heard you had plans to get a fresh tooth? But it fell through didn't it?
You gon' talk about my bread too, like Cortez crew ain't lend you digits
You on the menu I stepped cool in the venue clicking
Crazy, with two straps over my shoulder like a Bellevue visit
And I took off from the gate without a Jet-Blue ticket
Now 'Back That Ass Up', I been nice from the '99 to the 2000's as a Juvenile
Line it up here, straight over ya eye, that's a uni-brow
You a clown, he wouldn't shoot a round at a shoot-around
Put em down after I bow (BAOW), that's a Goonie round
You belong in the Proving Grounds, Barry Reese should be super proud
Four bar setup? Dawg, that's a Cass' trait, we all knew the style
Who could (hookah) lounge, when I'm smoking in the spot?
Put the hose to ya mouth, upload, wave, then zip em up, he a computer music file
And I did it with the MAC, so I'm sending him to the clouds
Lemme coach you for now, whatever movie crowd, this broad cast in
I'll gun butt em til his eye is like Hubie Brown (hue be brown)
Or the nozzle in the space where we see it's no tooth allowed
Bury him alive underground with no map, Smack, he gon' need a new route canal
This biblical
I should get A. Ward to baptize ya
Or have Saga tie ya to a Pathfinder and drive, you'll be a backslider
I'd rather let it sing till it hit you in ya soul like a black choir
Quagmire, his cheek get swole
You getting cayenne cooked, like chef's in Thailand, my guys land hooks
President of my gang and we jump niggas, I am Bush (ambush)
Tell this tramp, we amped, be gone
I'ma phenom
JayBlac, I'ma split him in half
No more callin' him the Champ...peon (Champion)
1-0, nothin' 'bout that debatable nigga
Wait 'til this next round
Got crazier shit to say to you nigga

[Round 2: DNA]
I was playin' possum, while you and your niggas was poppin' shit about me on the blogs, tryin' to trick the media
I said, "Ain't none of y'all about shit."
That go for everyone in Mause clique, I'm sick of seein' ya
All this, "He can't beat me with the O-Red material."
That shit deceiving ya
Cause I got bio first, just to get Factz on sight (site); Wikipedia
Ya name Mark Williams, you was born in 1982, that's why this line is genius
Cause you 36, I'm 27 {gun clicks} and here's the .9 between us
Who you been sparrin' wit'? Chilla?
Well in this arena (Serena) you better hope your shit the meanest
Cause ten is (tennis) goin' to whoever give the assist (a sis') to Williams
And Smack, don't make [?] (Venus)
Let's get it in
You had a Rocky trainer, but now a don is (Adonis) in Mickey Gym
Get in shape, lift the weights before I split ya chin
I'm a fool with the Taurus, might hit a limb
So the judgement is bad for him, I'm a simpleton (simple ten)
The TEC louder, it's lead showers if you take Rain lightly, it's drizzlin'
And then I'll give the rest a dent (resident) in any room that you sit us in (citizen)
What you thought? Cause he was Crippin' in Cali that was a Nitty win?
Well I still had shit landin' (land and) overseas (over seas); amphibian
You can't be so fire as a ghostwriter if you gotta say it yourself
You a known liar
You mean to tell me you put hits on all these other niggas albums while yours stay on the shelf?
Well that's the shit we not buyin'
Get Rich Or Die Tryin'
Oh it ain't a Curtis (occur this) nigga playin' himself
The .50 'Outta Control' and when the guns come out I be makin' a Massacre
So Marcus got a [?] oh I'ma clap a tre at this character
I seen you gon' do the believably angle
Cause some of the fans gon' say, "You on one Factz."
Like ever since I did the rocket launcher pose, none of y'all don't believe I ever palmed one gat
Well I'll admit, I was 15 since I let a small one clap
But it's muscle memory cause soon as I lift the arm it'll all come back
Whatchu know about fightin' witcha pops cause he abusin' on ya mother?
Or givin' ya cousin a gun but havin' to take it back because he tried to use it on his brother
See we wasn't always Criminal Minded
But had to sleep with the ratchet cause we scared of losin' one another
KRS-One, By All Means Necessary, I kept the Uzi on the (under) cover
The Bronx keep creatin' it, Queens keep on fakin'- man that song, I hated it
But since you cut from that cloth, I cut the fabric
And this revenge for MC Shan, I brought a couple ratchets
As far as bullets, a ton will (tunnel) fuck up his passage
So yeah 'The Bridge Is Over' but whoever's under passes (underpasses)
I'm gettin' busy, Nina is loyal, she's stickin' wit' me
Razor, spectacular Bluestar; Pretty Ricky
Gun, I'm cozy wit' it, Twork said the target was this nigga Nitty
So I started druggin' Rum, but somehow I slipped to Mickey
You like to do letter force and tell black people about their credit scores
Like, "You'll be left in a slum
If you don't got 720 or better you'll be dead in a month."
Well that's a lie cause with a .357 I can get whatever I want
Who I'm battlin'? Mickey? Mark? Mause? Or is it Renegade?
That's my target I reached it
Mickey a bitch, Marcus- man your whole squad in a precinct, I got the Blueprint
On the .9, 11
See that bar was decent, and I got an M-16 (Em' 16) for 'Renegade'
And don't make me go to the car to (Carter) release it
Take your favorite battler
Put him against an industry dude who they make the challenger
Then they let vultures in the culture, every time they get paid they make a Massacre
But we outweigh in caliber
You keep switchin' from Mickey Mause to Mark, you the main ambassador
And the reason why the scene's fucked up, stop breakin' character
I'm really wit' the shits
Y'all know a nigga's soft when you tell a nigga, 'Get a bitch"
And as far as you winnin' this second round, that's a stretch Mark, I'm serious (Serius) with Clips
You wanted the small room, we could've did this on Summer Madness
But look at him tryin' to act up on person
But we all know Mark is (Marcus) Smart, he ain't wanna take it back up to Irving
All them Lux mannerisms is cause you lackin' ability
On this turf you need natural delivery
Or you gon' get torched on this land Mark (landmark); The Statue Of Liberty
I'm more pissed, then I hit up Rain, grabbed the four fifth
And he keep it by the foot Mark, all they seen is my dawg prints
Let's start with Mark
You never made a mark to start
Like did nothin' remarkable, that's why you can't market Mark
They not impressed Mark, so they bench Mark
Cause they never like Mark at heart
And now he's dead, and it's like Ted the bear will be next to Marky Mark
If y'all don't wanna see me give Mickey D's then y'all should leave now
Cause whoever preach will get the Big MAC, like they start and rebound
Pppt pppst, and you gon' get a burst of bullets, each round
So it's either your clique hurries or I'ma give Mick' flurries (McFlurries) 'til the machine down

[Round 2: Mickey Factz]
This battle was easy to tackle, quit fumbling, this real legit pummeling
You getting killed Superbad, word to my state ID, Mick lovin' (McLovin) it
Complete gritty, this geek sweet, y'all thought he would compete? Really?
Well I gave you the shot, and once it came outta st john, he died, Malik Sealy
120 battles, ya missin' tooth, how you on ESPN every year?
Your retarded faces
NWX
In K-Shine's fight with Chess, how you almost left in despair
Whatever else that's predictable, that people use against you, I won't mention it here
So everybody grab ya asthma pumps, it's time for a breath of fresh air
I've known Clips before you, and he wasn't playing c-lo on the corner
Then he met you, and ended up broke, in the casino outta order
But that's ya brother tho
It's crazy how you rep him
You go with him to roulettes, lose bets, he be too stressed and you don't painfully regret it?
Gamblin' ya friendship is criminal, and you aiding in the betting (and abetting)
URL don't respect you, they dropped Twork vs Chess, then Twork vs Suge
And before we ever see DNA vs Twork, we'll prolly see Twork vs Goodz
It's December 15th that battle still ain't dropped
Why you let 'em vault that?
And let this footage not come out, it's gon' be a real Infinity War Smack
And I ain't aiming for his head, I'm aiming for the shit that he threw, the thorax (Thor ax)
Fall back, cause you know everything I say all facts
But hang on scrap, you the real reason Head ICE ain't on Smack
Long story short, my man called me and told me
"Yo, this nigga ICE dissed his girl. Had the little nigga heated
Tried to poke ya chest out, but ya heart was frigid and anemic
I mean, literally freezing
And before the line dropped, my man said he saw ICE fishin' for a reason
I called back like, "Wait a second, he wouldn't leave his crew. He had to get his front on son."
He said, "Nah son, this time it was only with Beasley, and had ICE elated for the 1 on 1."
I said, "Wait a second. Is there footage?"
He said, "Yeah, the kid almost got his cap twisted
Uncle Ra got the child proof so."
You can bring up the shit about Budden, I don't avoid the wild truth
But when you alone and you see ICE, nigga turn into the Boy That Cried, "WOLF!"
This nigga fake, I should spit in ya ridiculous face
But I'ma sit and wait, real quiet, I don't instigate
Trip em, soon as I spot him, lift the iron and this is fate and
I'm standing over the nigga body like I'm liftin' weights
Big mistake
Cause you 'bout to say some dumb shit like
"Bring water ya back yard... cannonball
I draw and will (wheel) fire first... neanderthal
The tre young, and I'll put the bird to ya chest... Atlanta Hawks."
Stupid ass bars, punchlines that don't make sense and random bars
A bunch of dumb shit, with your hands and all
And everybody gon' go crazy for that shit and applaud
Meanwhile I'm breakin' DNA down better than a scientist
Chin made of glass, still ain't got that frontal though, I admit
At least you ain't get a Blue Tooth, but he on the jaw wire list
The fire lit, I'ma body ya, stenographer, I was hype typing this
Quiet down, cause you just wrote a round of head scratchers; psoriasis
Violence, me and my pack take pride in this, a lion since
This pussycat was never in the jungle, that's the truth and I'm defining just where the lyin' (lion) is
Stomp him, till he feel the pain from the foot, no podiatrist
Snub nose, sinuses, let it spread viruses
And if Big T jump in, silencers, now he no longer the quietest
I'm wrecking his environment, they wanted me to shake the room now you caught up in an earthquake
He tried to size Mick' (seismic) wave
It ain't my fault lines been ground breaking in the first place
Y'all let this herb say anything! To the point, he don't think believability matters
But that made him wacker
Cause now he don't even believe ability matters
Mick dapper, Y-3 from the fit to the sneaks
He'll (hill) rock gear amounting (a mountain) to nothing, here's the cliffhanger, he say the shit is to steep
Big dagger at this inconsiderate idiot's cheek
Then blade in his mouth, lets see if he can escape by the skin of his teeth
2-0 ain't nothing bout that debatable nigga
Wait 'til the next round, got crazier shit to say to you nigga

[Round 3: DNA]
Soon as they said, "DNA vs Mickey" all the bloggers said, "This sound like a match."
I said it's no stoppin' me, King Of Comedy I get around (a round) with a MAC (Mack)
.380 squirtin', baby burpin', you get the pound on the back
And then I switch grips, some big shit, switch grips, some big shit, I'm 'bout to go ballistic, let's get down to the Factz
You said why I'm always grinnin' when I see you?
I said, "Clips, tell this clown to relax."
See Chucky (Chuck E) Cheesin' cause I'm finna give a round to a rat
You'll find out what's in store, when you're found on your back
.40, Menace II Society this a counter attack (counterattack)
I caught his moms before dinner, it's a family of three now
SM7, let's see what you can take from the meal (mil') like a Reed round
Dezi in the left, somethin' in the other hand like in the meanwhile
So this cat (Katt) Williams better stand up or fiend down
Arms, both up like "So what?"
Or your boss head in-between the subs; cold cuts
The toast up, and I know stuff
I'll have my man from behind lick (Heimlich), Maneuver or be choked up
You was born on July 13th, your Zodiac's a cancer
And I ain't gon' talk about this for half of the battle
Headshot, Factz will unravel
And whoever stuck in this shell see why this crab get the barrel
You don't want war, the signs show, you crack under pressure
And y'all better know that
Talk about y'all the rulers of the moon
Well tell the scope (telescope) that
You know who you are? The DJ Akademiks of battle rap
Cause you move like a vulture
You got nothin' to do with this culture
But always try to tell us what to do with the culture
And Daylyt's Tekashi, this time I'm [?]
Cause there's a blog and you said he wasn't a troll until he met you
So what you told him?
"Forget rhymes, times change"?
Then you switched sides
Diss this Crip guys, like that don't coincide with the big time 9 tre's
And if his Zodiac's a Cancer, then how could you ever come at 69 sideways?
I hate you nigga, but this is how it has to be
In this culture, you could never talk stats with me
I put a 150 in this shit, even did a match for free
As far as the Summer Madness 2 sponsor, that was me
Nikiya workin' with King Of The Dot, that's attached to me
So when a Massacre make profits, I should get the tax with fees
I'm the nigga that brought Harry to URL, you don't believe ask and see
Now think, "If DNA wasn't in this culture" where battle rap would be
The 2 on 2's, ESPN, that was me
WWE promos, that was me
And you a has been on the sideline, it's sad to see
So how the fuck is the nigga opinionated talkin' Factz wit' me?
What? You got some advice from Lupe? That was you good luck move?
Well I brought a good pump through
It hit floors, leavin' your men tore (mentor) with somethin' they can look up to
This rappin' is a test, we was actually convinced
That you was top notch but then stock dropped, now you battlin' for rent
You and Lupe was in the same league but he was crashin' with the hits
But if you are what you say you are a 'Superstar' you wouldn't have had us in suspense
Cause he took the style you kicked, pushed and it's been a Fiasco ever since
You been prolongin' this ass whoopin'
And everywhere, I could've did this in the spring you picked the December date
But I ain't trippin'
I guess since he boo'd up he ain't wanna take an L in May
Oh y'all ain't know? This nigga Mickey Factz got a wife and her name is "Iesha"
This nigga is married married
To the point where she be stressin' about the money that he makin'
Like, "Baby this industry shit ain't gon' cut it. Go back to battle rap
Fuck ya past relations."
If she pregnant, I catch her coolin' at the 'Playground', you know, runnin' back and pacin'
Stomach shot 'Iesha' won't have Another Bad Creation
I heard she sick with somethin' though, look at him tight, mean muggin'
It's called Fibromyalgia but I confused it with arthritis when the heat dumpin'
And I know that's a tender spot for what this joint (disjoint) this E's (disease) comin'
Like I'm reachin' for the [?] like I need somethin'
While my trigger finger itchin' like a fiend comin'
I catch him at the crib, his knees bucklin'
And then pile ten in like the D's comin'
Random Factz, these are random facts
I was listenin' to your music and right before pressin' start
I see the cover to your Mause mixtape and I got a question Mark
See there's been some things that I've been waitin' to say
Cause if y'all don't know his character on that mixtape was an 80's graffiti artist that died from AIDS
And I think he made a mistake
Cause on the tape he was cool with Jean Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Keith Haring
And y'all think cause they pavin' the way
But what y'all don't know is all three of them painters were gay
Now I'm not sayin' you gay
But I'm sayin' you gay
If these was football rules you'll be under review, changin' the play
So if at the end of the tape you die from AIDS and all them niggas-
You know what? You was just concerned with the raps
What? You get a gay fan base you'll be on to some plaques?
You're delusional, and so far from reality
But I guess you had no other alternative, Factz
But see when you hate a nigga like this you gotta study the opposition
So I started writin' in my composition
And then when I got to the name Mickey Factz, ding: contradiction
Cause your first name's Mickey, which is a fictional character
But then it becomes tricky
Cause your last name's Factz which means "real" but something about you is just iffy
That's why y'all will have to listen cause his ass is trippin'
You better make up your mind nigga, which one is it?
Fact or fiction?
I ain't come to play
So don't get amped I'm still The Champ, might get another belt
Suck my dick, fuck your bitch, fuck her health
It's NWX we run this shit, we the ones that's felt
And I don't wanna hear y'all say the culture robbing (Robin) Williams, he hung himself!
Round 3 it's gettin' hot in here, Smack Volume 3 you know my slogan
(Get him the fuck outta here!)
Hell no, he died get his ghost the fuck in here
One industry nigga down get King Los the fuck in here!

[Round 3: Mickey Factz]
Instead of taking this battle, you was better off hugging a Cactus Jack
Going against a young Mick Foley
You only really good at rebuttaling Mr. Ed, that makes you a one trick pony
I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but your supporters think your rap pen dry
Your followers move with you though, even when you don't got an electric line, its something ya fans let slide
And that's the main reason I'ma break DNA down to the last enzyme
In Jurassic Park, mosquito's were covered in sap, and the blood they extract was to make dinosaurs
And to bring em back, they used a frog's DNA to fill in the gaps, and combined it all
That's why your a sap, cause the shit from people you extract, is to hide your flaws
And that's the main reason you still got that gap, cause you need something to identify as yours
Example... we first seen you freestyle against Real Deal, in front of Nigel
He had the rightful rebuttal title, he towered over everybody and for you, that was an eyeful (Eiffel)
Then you blew up after goin' off the top of your mind
And taking from him, proved to us, why you so Hollow inside
Case in point
I've known you for years, you been dirty, way before early
Then right before thirty, you got Conceited and started Wild N Out with the jersey's
Slow it down ma, look at how son dress, you took it literal
Then turned to a reporter once he had Con in the view (interview)
That makes you a replica, not authentic material, that's conditional
All the way down to ya rhyme pattern, i seen the Clips in you
Chuckie put his hand on ya forehead, transferred his hood vibes
Then let his Child Play, after he dolled him up to make him a good guy
Then you and K link, now you pacing and punching in every line
Why Flex, you want the credit, fine?
But why would I credit you for sending shots? Did he (Diddy) make up the style? Never mind
It wasn't you behind the bars it was Shine (Shyne)
And you got ya slang from Cortez, and never learned Spanish
Aww bendito
I won't call you a Mexican or an essay 'Tez, that's Don Marino
But keep giving em slang, behind the scenes for URL, Chico
That's five people, that this nigga keep at bay planted
Without their strands of DNA, we would've seen DNA stranded
Be blessed... and that movie you referenced got extreme depth
Cause time is money and even they knew you couldn't go more rounds with a T-Rex
I ain't condoning that, ex couch potato, so for (sofa) that, blaow!
A section will (sectional) come out, like where you was dozin' at
Finish lines and keep running with it, you getting overlapped
Trumping him, easily too, so if you vote for that
That's cold, *ch ch* so I'ma give everybody on the poll a (polar) cap
He's still underground? From the first round? Root canal
Lemme finish the puzzle
It's a loco motive, clip with a muzzle
Infrared so when he poke his head out, he'll see the light at the end of the tunnel
But he's brave, handle hot, it need shade
Blazing, D. Wade appreciating the fans, the Heat wave
You doing what? Man I'm suited up like I'm cool with Lux
Mook what up?
You had a chopper with 32 passengers you could tuck
Cool, I got the same passengers but my shit is a moving bus
So when it transfer over, i just make a move and bust!
You should duck
Prey on him with the piece at his temple, that's a Buddhist monk
Send him a clip with my thumbs up, I'ma movie buff
Cause when you hold a gun properly Eric your two thumbs are usually up
Where ya hoe? Hit her heart, get his love struck, but that's what Cupid wants, stupid cunt
That's what you get caping for the super slut
And since she ya heroine, I'm aimin' high and she gettin' drug down after I stopped shootin' up
Take it in vein, with a blade and while you slicin' ya little wrist
And feelin' a lil' sick, lets get into this Yung Ill shit
For years , you called me your enemy
Real recklessly
Whats the science DNA? Cause We never had good chemistry
You had this tendency, of lashing out, well keep that same energy
Cause I could use a tool bar for ya mind, but I'd rather refresh ya memory
Magic vs QP, you came up to me with your dysfunctional smile
And said "I'ma do something crazy! I want you in front of the crowd!
Yung Ill getting 3-0'd, I'ma do something great to him."
And with all the random spit that came out of Leon Spinks mouth, you never told me what you'd say to him
Yung Ill said, it was someone in your crew, you disregarded that
You did interviews and dropped diss tracks, I got called a rat
For all of that? Me telling Ill? You think I started that?
When he made blogs sayin' I diss him?
Cause Rich beat him...you think I wanted that?
Look no punchline, know all the facts and all the raps
I told Verb, you wanted me in the front, here's the awkward catch
Verb told Ill what I said, and Ill responded back
"I know exactly what he gonna do already, cause someone else informed me that."
For years, I was the one they said the snitching was dealt
But I been knew who told...and guess what I kept that shit to my self
Took the blame, even took the fall, and never once asked for a "Sorry."
And still, I will not say who told Yung Ill

[Aye Verb]
But I will...it was Charlie

[Mickey Factz]
And I still haven't told "it was Ill" and that's actually a fact
But when you think about it, Lux friend's father, Cortez at his house
He let the Spanish nigga rat
How you think we found out about you on the couch?
That nigga been a chatty little rat
Now that's a real four bar setup, and I know it don't make sense, but neither does half of all ya raps
And since you love clappin' machetes it only makes sense a Clips stabbed you in the back!
