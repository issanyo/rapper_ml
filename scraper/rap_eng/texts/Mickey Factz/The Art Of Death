[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Intro]
What? No no no... is he? You gotta be kidding me. Serious? Jean? Dead? No no no no no no. I don't believe you. Oh no...
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
I just want you to pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me

[Verse 1]
I just want you to talk to the lord, tell him that I feel desolate
Basquiat just left us, overdose left him breathless
Am I next on that checklist? Walking into his funeral
Wishing I could put a crown on him, that would be so suitable
King SAMO
Got a Halo
But I'm selfish cause I'm wishing God let em stay though
When Andy died I thought that's it
But I'm standing here at this casket
With my friend here
I think to myself is the end near? Have I been there?
I don't know
Don't go!
How could you leave, us in the cold
Left Honolulu and said that you grown
You said you was leaving heroin alone
But you was alone, never would know
Now I'm here but you dead and gone
Shedding a tear, watching it roll
Pouring out beer, this one for my bro
Get off my back!
This shit is wack!
I wanna relax then tell myself that this is an act
He's coming back, this is a fact!
But he's not, and he won't
Wanna leave, but I don't
Then I do, then I see
Myself, it coulda been me

[Break]
When people are ready to, they change. They never do it before then, and sometimes they die before they get around to it. You can't make them change if they don't want to, just like when they do want to, you can't stop them

[Hook]
I don't wanna die
Floating in the sky
Mama at my casket
Looking at her cry
Why can't we live forever
Someone tell me why
Scared for my life
Only thing that I can say is:
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
I just want you to pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me
Pray for me

[Verse 2]
I just want you to talk to the lord
Somebody please pray for me
I had a girl that laid with me
But I don't know what she gave to me
Basically, I'm scared now
Body starting to feel weird now
Hearing rumors bout H.I.V
Its about to take Keith Haring out
Oh not again
Almost out of friends
Soon as I try again, just to try and win, I die again
This so tiring
I have been, to the promise land
Where the angel harps and the violins
Are the soundtracks to retiring and I'm tired of it
What, did I do?
Who, did I screw?
What did she give?
What did she spew?
Contaminate me with whatever she grew
Whatever she knew, she kept to herself
Who woulda knew the devil herself
Un-buckle my belt, fuck with my health
Somebody help! Somebody help!
Colorful red
Colors are shed
Stuck in the bed
Wanna be dead
Up on a ledge
Over the edge
Left deceased
Sketch the streets
Death complete
Rest in peace
Nap forever
The art of the death is my last adventure...

[Break]
I always wished I'd died, and I still wish that, cause I could have gotten the whole thing over with. Not to mention, dying is the most embarrassing thing that can ever happen to you, cause someone's got to take care of all your nonsense when you leave

[Hook]
