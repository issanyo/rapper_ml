[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Intro]
Do you feel that the public has insulted your art?
Uh, no
Why not?
Uh, well, I hadn't thought about it
It doesn't bother you at all then?
Uh, No
Well, do you think they're showing a lack of appreciation for what pop art means?
Uh, no
Andy, do you think that pop art has sorta reached the point where its becoming repetitious now?
Uh, yes
Do you think it should break away from being pop art?
Uh, no
Are you just going to carry on?
Uh, yes

[Verse 1]
The 1st MauSe to write soundtracks for your eyes
Spray can on the ground, that's my supply
From an era where you found crack all the time
Fiends gotta buy they child back for a dollar sign
Ha, They sold kids for a dope binge
Family tree branch broken, no timbs
Most men, made girls sell they own skin
I chose pens, a street artist who wrote gems
Gold rims on the 89 bm dub
A-Team on the screen, Mr. T was thug
18 with a dream, no sleeping drug
Lemme tell ya, lemme tell ya what I'm dreaming of
Gallery space
Walls get removed from the palette's I make
Lost in a groove of reality, wait!
Its for ya eye balls
I'm from New york son, thought I remind yall

[Hook]
I'm from the era of Hulk Hogan & Crack
I'm from the era of Hulk Hogan & Crack
I'm from the era of Hulk Hogan & Crack
Hulk Hogan & Crack, Hulk Hogan & Crack
I'm from the era of Hulk Hogan & Crack
I'm from the era of Hulk Hogan & Crack
I'm from the era of Hulk Hogan & Crack
Hulk Hogan & Crack, Hulk Hogan & Crack

[Verse 2]
Polo got boosted out of every store
Train cars had a mural on every door
I had one rope chain I was very poor
But dudes in the dope game gave me many more
Guy named Mike Tyson gotta fast right
My cash tight, ducking guard with their flashlights
My tape popped in my walk-man, that's twice
I seen a virgin last night, hit a glass pipe
(Shutters)
It took her brain off
Chopped the top of my can, had a spray off
Came off with my fire like I was laid off
Lemme tell ya, lemme tell ya how I made off
Sneakers tied tight
Ink from the question mark dripped on my Nike's
Security guards tried to stop my bike
No hope for em
Kicked his ass in his leg and I broke on em

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I looked up to Dwight Gooden as a Mets fan
Parties at the Mudd Club was the best, man
Juan Dubose Dj'ing the best jams
I was telling Kenny Scharf bout my next plan
It was tighter than a Jake The Snake head lock
And I was higher than a Hulk Hogan leg drop
Catch me at the pop shop with the best top
Art is life, let the rest watch
MauSe

[Break]
Once I left home, ya know, I started doing all that drinking and throwing bottles and all that kinda stuff
Yea, And uh, And drawing on the streets?
Yea

[Hook]

[Outro: Hulk Hogan]
For all my hulk-a-maniacs, that have stuck with me through the thick and thin, trained, said their prayers and eat your vitamins, be a survivor man. Don't smoke its a joke!
