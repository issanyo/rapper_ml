Whatcha do, whatcha do
Whatcha ya doin, doin' to me
Hypno-touch, don't wanna leave
She got me, she got me
She got me, she got me
She got me, she got me
Whatcha ya do, doin' to me
I'm into you, rubbin' her knee
She got me, she got me
She got me, she got me
She got me, she got me

[Verse 1: Mickey Factz]
Well let me keep it real with cha'll
Shorty had no gas in
Remember that Hypnotize Biggie video when he rolled backwoods
Well that's how she got me
Ma got curves like a hot Ferrari
Now I share like the paparazzi
Until I ride her like a Kawasaki (ha)
Where she headed?
I don't even know but I really wanna get it
Chanel tank top and a new pair of leggins
Gotta a brother beggin' here thinking about a wedding
I do, think about you
Color of your thong, I think about blue
When we get alone whatchu you think I'm gunna do
So if I think about it, do you think about it too
I don't know
But she ain't hearing that
Told me to hit the road so she ain't hearing jack
But that ain't changing the fact
That you made me attached like you came with a latch
And I think she a catch
I swear she on fire like she came with a match-ress
Slow that one down, you know what I want now
Girl stop playing with me

[Hook]
Whatcha ya doin, doin' to me
Hypno-touch, don't wanna leave
She got me, she got me
She got me, she got me
She got me, she got me
Whatcha ya do, you doin' to me
I'm into you, rubbin' her knee
She got me, she got me
She got me, she got me
She got me, she got me
Got me hypnotized, got me hypnotized
Got me hypnotized, got me hypnotized
Baby girl I'm lost in a dream
Got me hypnotized, got me hypnotized
Got me hypnotized, got me hypnotized
Baby girl I'm lost in a dream

[Verse 2]
I wanna wake up, I wanna see where the dream gunna take us
Put my lips everywhere from the waist up
I'm trying to throw a party for my taste buds
Baby, I'm hypnotized by this lady
Hips and thighs got me crazy
Cinnamon eyes that look wavy
And this is why I get angry
You make me, just lose it
I swear that this is confusing
And you remind me of my music
Cuz I wanna hit but it's elusive
But girl, once I get to you
You're gunna wonder what I did to you
C'mon, trying to help you notice
That the love spell is broken
