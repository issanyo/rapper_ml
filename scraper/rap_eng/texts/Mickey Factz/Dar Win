Hook:
Naysayers flex while we lift weights
They placin' no bets while we risk-take
It's like we kissed cake, the taste is always sweet
Success equates to never thinking of defeat
Adapt to thrive, we're past survival
We Dar-win every game, the past is our rival
Adapt to thrive, we're past survival
Say goodbye to coastin', we're wavin', tidal

Verse 1:
I fell into a scary well and didn't have the will to scale it very well
My Little Murmurs brought no aid, no aerial (Ariel)
Assistant just distance and a dark fate
Til I said “fair thee well” to fairy tails
Brought the stark blade down, to get my reality up
Valleys to mountains, low to high, soda high
Not temporary though, I carry Joe, the coffee kind
Mr. Bean, coffee grind, but comedy is far behind
My focus to give honest lines
Grew from a tadpole in a bad hole
To a mad bull lookin' dead ahead
Red plaid wool, impale the threads
Building a dream, took nails to bed
Now I'm sealed in a dream, lookin' nailed to the bed
Give Talks like TED, killing a little thought if it got up in my head
Might as well think big, as our thoughts evolve we do too
Animal Farm, we're on the brink of being pigs
So I gorge more well thoughts, get my crew out the zoo

Verse 2 (Mickey Factz):
Revenge is best served on a wide dish
Fork knife and a napkin to wipe the pride with
My mind is a time glitch, felines twitch
Deja vu, hate on who? Not my grind kid
I'm Neo Andersen stoppin' bullets you brandishin'
I consider it shots of hate, I out-balance em
These frenemies try and kill my vibe, ill advised
Rather be a mannequin than make that man a kin of mine
I'm on the verge of success, I see the promise land
Trust me I can see it baby, no sonogram
I got a plan, I'm the man, it's not a scam
Like Juwanna man, my two feet I gotta stand on
The Don, that's who they honor fam
They see the shades and beards, call em Harden fans
I'm the hope in the desert without a water can
I guess I'm livin' out a Darwin plan

Verse 3:
I use my noggin like an Etch a Sketch
Draw a vision, get to joggin'
If I fail I just shake it fresh
Turn the knobs til my reality is picturesque
I pick the best cause
If I stick to the nest and never fly the coop
I'd probably only get to test drive a coupe
Nah, I'm gonna keep my labor on a Loop
Then consume the Fruits they said I couldn't cause I can too
Like some toucans these two can ruin
Ground level thinking cause we flew our own route and
We're well aware it's survival of the fittest
So we lift and leverage our gifts until we finish
I'm not always in a calm position during composition
And though my notebook is college-ruled
It's lines are filled with non-collegiate missions
My vision is different
Adapt to thrive, the only way I'm livin'
Flow Life
