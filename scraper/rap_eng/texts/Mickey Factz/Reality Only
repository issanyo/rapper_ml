[Intro: Jon Matthews]
And now... coming to the stage
New York... Delaware
Cypher Clique... Mickey Factz
It's a moment

[Intro Verse: James Major]
They wanna ride the wave and I know why
Alabama flow cause these niggas all roll tide
Trynna get fly like I, requires more spendin'
Don't worry boys we got it covered no (?)

[Verse 1: Mic Anthony]
Big money like draft day, no roaches in my ash tray
She neck it while she rollin' up trees, we just call that shit giraffe head
You can't pass me, even at a pitstop
I ain't got a wristwatch but time goin' ticktock
And I been hot, niggas shoulda been dropped
I be with the women head spinnin' like a disc jock
And what I need a weapon for? Condoms on my dresser drawer
I don't ever sweat her so my presence never stress her more
Lookin' for a Sicamore, plus I'm never sick of whores
Fetish for the lettuce what the fuck you think I'm in it for
I'm disrespecful every time that I spit
But we the only ones that's movin' so they all on my dick
I mean, such a predicament for rappers spittn' gibberish
They frontin' on the internet but niggas know we livin' it
Plus every time I spit they know it's a wrap
The Clique is movin' locomotive plus we spittin' with Factz
(Gimmie dap)

[Bridge: James Major)
No we won't stop
Started from the bottom now we made it to the top
I'm a bad boy so I feel like the Lox
But I got the juice so I'm feelin' like Pac

[Hook: Mic Anthony]
And we could get it poppin'
All night long
And we'll be reefer coppin'
All night long
She said that she ain't droppin'
All night long
I guess that we ain't stoppin;
All night long

[Verse 2: Mickey Factz]
I take them lemons life yeah
Wanna get to heaven right where Christ live
Look at where I'm headed it's decisive
Pray I don't get beheaded like the ISIS
Every move priceless, checkmate, Bobby Fisher head case
Ridin' til the wheels fall off up in this bread chase
Feelin' like a fed case, facing life
No it ain't a game I'm in dead space, runnin' in a death race
My legs straight, get cake on a pave path
Take it for what it is never remain mad
Spend money, save cash that the bank have
My name framed in glass for all this paid stash
It could be bumpy it could be rocky
I don't think that I'm lucky so I ain't cocky
Road blocks trynna stop me in my mazzi
Tires a tight end, no Jeremy Shockey

[Bridge: James Major)
No we won't stop
Started from the bottom now we made it to the top
I'm a bad boy so I feel like the Lox
But I got the juice so I'm feelin' like Pac

[Hook: Mic Anthony]
And we could get it poppin'
All night long
And we'll be reefer coppin'
All night long
She said that she ain't droppin'
All night long
I guess that we ain't stoppin;
All night long

[Verse 3: Relay]
Coppin' on the spot cause I'm makin' bands
While you squealin' to the merchant for a payment plan
Whole team in the boardroom, shaking hands
Sippin' Moet, while they're serving steak and lamb
Goin' over plots, to take us to the top
In many different spots, you with it or you not
As soon as we sign on the dotted, we gon' do it big like Wallace
Different presidents inside the pockets
Nowadays we gettin' chauffeured around
Guzzling Crown, loungin' while we roll thru the town
Taking pics with the fans, do it gig for a grand
Need a list of demands before I spit for the fans
Then it's showtime, hit em with my dope lines
The way I flow lines, bet I'll get a cosign
Or a bad chic, finer than some old wine
Cause of my platinum thoughts, keep your gold mine

[Bridge: James Major)
No we won't stop
Started from the bottom now we made it to the top
I'm a bad boy so I feel like the Lox
But I got the juice so I'm feelin' like Pac

[Hook: Mic Anthony]
And we could get it poppin'
All night long
And we'll be reefer coppin'
All night long
She said that she ain't droppin'
All night long
I guess that we ain't stoppin;
All night long
