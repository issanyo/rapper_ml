[Intro]
Warning! Warning!
Evacuation will commence
In approximately one minute
Please stay tuned
Latch all available doors
Thank you

[Verse]
One, let your head nod to the drum
Two, I'm a tell you what to do
Three, hands are what I want to see
Four, let's get it on, forget about
Five, gots to get live
I want to see y'all hands in the sky
Put them up high, let's feel the vibe
Sorry, no magazine required
Hop in the ride, time to decide
I want to know if you ready for the drive
When we collide, it won't be a crash
More like a prize I won't let pass
I'm so fly, I got jetlag
I don't know why but I won't ask
And I won't brag, cause you'll get mad
Can't be touched, who is this bad?
Michael, flow is trifle
Doing handstands on a motorcycle
I'm so damn spiteful
It's hot when no one's like you
You wack cause no one likes you
It's sad cause no one tries to
We in the land of the lost
I'm lost in a land that I can't get across

I want to see underarms

[Hook]
Jump in my car
Step on the brakes
This is my job
Hand on the wheel

Ain't no facade, ain't no mirage
Everything you see is here, it's not far
Nah, it's not far, man it's right here
This is where it starts, let's get it clear

Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air

[Bridge]
Put, put them up high, let's feel the vibe
Just put them up high, let's feel the vibe
Just put them up high, let's feel the vibe
I want to see y'all hands in the sky

Put them up
Put them up high
Put them up
I want to see y'all hands in the sky

Omega!

[Hook]
Jump in my car
Step on the brakes
This is my job
Hand on the wheel

Ain't no facade, ain't no mirage
Everything you see is here, it's not far
Nah, it's not far, man it's right here
This is where it starts, let's get it clear

Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air

Omega!
