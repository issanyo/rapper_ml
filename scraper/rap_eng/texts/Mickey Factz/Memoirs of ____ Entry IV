[Thoughts from MauSe]

I stopped smoking and got more into drinking
And I don't know why, don't ask me, I can't explain that
I used to be afraid to die however
Now, not really anymore
I've learned to accept whatever comes in my way
Probably because I know after my eyes close
The eyes of others will be opened to my heart
They criticize you when you're alive
And memorialize you when you die
I've seen it done to all my friends and it's really sad
And I know eventually, it will happen to me
I mean, look at Michael Jackson, he is the greatest entertainer living right now
"Thriller" is by far my favorite album right now, I listen to it all the time
And aside from Madonna, he is the best living right now
But the media is already beginning...
Meanwhile he's just starting to do the impossible
Watch, mark my words, when he dies
The world will cry, the whole world
Let's hope he never dies
And I hope they'll cry for me though
'Cause I'm ready to leave
