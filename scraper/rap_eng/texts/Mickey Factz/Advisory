[Intro: ANoyd]
Yeah
Look, yeah

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm out here giving trays to the poor
Man, what the fuck do y'all portray?
Been called broke by niggas that I don't fuck with all the way
I'm old school with Dr. J
At Rucker Park today
I'm Kyrie when his jersey not tucked in all the way, murder
My vise versa would change through it, vice verses
Barely come to the service, I been through the epidermis
Rappers be signing like they be spittin' that shit in cursive
Life starts to make sense when you livin' out niggas verses, aw
I lost brotherhoods with people I ain't think I would
I ain't know that your sacrifice had a limit
Look, I lost brotherhoods with people I ain't think
Instead of being here to witness, now you gotta bear witness, aw
Pull up in fear, but you can't pull up a chair
Had you head up all the time, let it down and blood appear
All I hear is sin, yeah, I got that Joe Budden ear
Forever here like spaghetti stains in Tupperware
World premier with people that pucker up with the puppeteer
Made me wearin' [?] this situation to persevere, nah
The rapper that CD go to rapper, 3 musketeers
You hustle 'round, I take your people, I'm comin' like Paul Revere, pause
And do the blood on spears, I shake spears like Britney havin' a seizure, ain't playin' Julius Caesar
Like writin' lefty in pencil, words did get smudged
And everything went bad like the fridge unplugged
With these words, blame it on JAY-Z
With other main verses, you never could microwave me
I kill ya, I keep my record clean
Like the radio wanna play this S.A.P
Everything you hearin' from me, you can't even blame me, clear
Vintage frames over the dark brown iris
Y'all hear a song and make somethin' that sound like it
I hear a song and I only care if my mom like it
I take the mic on stage and then I'm blind sighted
Perfect combination between humble and confident
It was mine, you meant to say it was a monument
And it's cool that the talent don't get acknowledgement
This shit is written, we livin' after approximate
'Noyd

[Bridge: Oswin Benjamin]
Fuck, yeah, yeah, uh
In advise
Yeah, yeah, uh
In advise
Yeah, yeah, uh
In advise

[Verse 2: Oswin Benjamin]
Label a sinner who lost religion and found meaning and speakin' wit' God
Through confidants who kindly wade through the law
We both required keys, but keepin' it raw
And for my dogs it was means of movin' narcotics through paws
But you see for me I resembled cars
After 2013 I needed a push to get started
With the belief, this kind of drive gets you farther than most
You confiscatin' my pad or just my quotes
I'm aware there's more than one way of taking notes
It's the takeover
Like a boo-boo in the booth
I'm puchin' in like I'm broken to purchase new things
My sober minds 100-proof
Invader rollin' loose-leaf
My pastor sayin' "Lieutenant, get defensive" while they Drew Brees
I escape through the loose leaf
No glory and grief, got doubt on my sleeve
Had 'em silver with gold standards ain't shit out of my league
I adjusted to climate change I am [?] fatigue
Lil Yacht don't get what you saying, well that boat ain't for me
I emerged from the abdomen of the beast
I slept on floorboards and backseats
I sacrificed a lot for a dream
In the world of niggas to deep in they sleep
Oh so believe I'll leave your cheek a lil uzi if you fuckin' with me
I ain't a killer either
I'm just a dread with a little Caeser
A general who delivers with or without the dough
But y'all can keep the cheese if it motivates you to be a leader
You keep the guns if it motivates you to be a Peter
See I'm bred different, you motivated by pieces of pita
We bred different, I been the one, see the swoosh on the sneaker
I feel the soul through the speakers
I'm motivated by freedom
My motivation been the voice of the people

[Verse 3: Mickey Factz]
They said write a 28 or two straight 16s
See I roll between seasons of 2K15
It feels seamless, like a seamstress who can't make your jeans fit
Needless to say I'm a genius, separation from a G and a J
Or a lion when he's seeing his prey
Or the Messiah when he's seeing us pray
You're a pariah that I need the filet
Easy to say, I'ma retire as the king of my day, Martin Luther
I've been in this position before
Kama Sutra, hallelujah
The screen go blah!
I'm a Kuma, make your dome crack
Now the doctor gotta borrow sutures
Give 'em strong maneuvers consider y'all manure
That's your girl of your dreams, I call that whore a kreuger
Wait; horror; Kreuger, I bet the broad a cougar
Back in '08, I made all the people follow Supras
Now they tie 'em together and toss 'em in Montezuma's
Your family tree ain't tough dawg, I hear the bark frontin'
Stand up, get re-seated like you just bought something
See, you get cooked in the grill, like you just caught something
Hip-hop's, we're up next to control like the alt button
Tell you the truth, I don't like the love it kinda sucks
I prick my finger then get a paper to write in blood
I make a whole album out of it, now I'm kinda buzzed
I'm lightheaded off raps, that's the highest drug
We gettin' high, epitomize the realest guy
Really fry from the city signs where Biggie died
Criticize and vilified but still alive
If I catch 'em I won't sympathize, you've been advised

[Verse 4: ANoyd]
You've been advised, I'm sick and tired, so pick a side
You Bruce, Kendall and Kylie so you choosing genocide
Synthesizing photosynthesis, Synth is the sun of god, no sign
I hold the weight inside and Gemini
My album a lot of shit that'll stick like a shish kebab
Put the emph in in emphasize, your service has been denied
Every time I got a 20 I would put the 10 aside
This generation is good if you stay to synchronize
You've been advised
