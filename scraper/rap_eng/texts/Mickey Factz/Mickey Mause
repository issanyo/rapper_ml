[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Verse 1]
Poor mans drive, rich mans plot
We all can't ride when the kick stand drops
All black sky, wristband watch
My thoughts track time till the second hand stops
The zone I'm in, alone with friends
I'm cold, like the patron within
My soul is froze to those that been
My foes and chose to hope I sin
I broke the pen, hard with the ink
I hope to win, draw till I faint
I brought all the paint, sellebrate everyday
Call up the saints, Walk in the bank
Take out a loan, buy me a home
I wanna own land, fuck having stones
All on ya neck and arms to show
King tut was robbed for those
And he was younger than all my bro's
So why we blinded by thoughts of gold
And diamonds
And chains
I'm tired of lames
Who try to be what they ain't but surprisingly, we're all kings

[Fab 5 Freddy]
It's like the same thing, you know, it's coming from the streets. It's what the people are into, so everybody can get down to the beat

[Verse 2]
Watch what I drew
Not what I spew
Ima triangle on top with a view
All seeing eye, loft with a roof
Working outside, drop cloth on the stoop
24-7, every other second
Living thru hell, but he can draw heaven
Night life living, scoring all women
Anything goes when its no more limits
I'm hanging with Pollack, Warhol chilling
Its all authentic
Yall all with it
Champagne spilling, yep ya boy did it
Let it drip
Let it rip
Wet paper, settlement
F haters, eat a dick
I'm sellebrating, where the chicks?
I want to take em, make em wasted, tape em
No exaggeration
My fascination is women congradulations
We young!
Come with me to door number 3 ima show you what she won
A ton of me a bunch of drinks, every night like a rerun
We ain't even begun
To see fun
Until now

[Verse 3]
Yes
No stress
Did it right, going left
Meet me, at coat check
Ill be there in no less
Than 4 sec's, if these chickens are boneless
Talking no sex...
What you mean girl?
& You ain't know that I'm so fetch?
Doggystyle, I go fetch
We talking now, what's next
Its morning now, I'm walking out
Let's get salmon croquette's
Scrambled eggs so fresh
And the toast we got is so french
Haaa
That's right...
Do it all day, see you tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
We back, don't leave
Ain't no tricks up my sleeve
Only chicks on my team
And when they sniff, they can't breathe
That's me, I'm live
Mickey Mause with a five
Grace Jones at my side
Question marks in my eyes
Surprise, I'm here
'88 was the year
A pair of Jordans was rare
Don't step on those, stay clear
Hah, this is me
Back in the party, I feel so free
Shades is on, look at me
Look at me, look at me, hah! Yeah
