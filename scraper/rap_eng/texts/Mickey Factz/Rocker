Rapping is my job so I work, work
See it's the reason I was put upon this earth, earth
My friends and my family say I'm a jerk jerk
Cos they don't know I'm taking music to the [hearse hearse]
I got this feeling
They don't understand the strain of what I deal with
All [in the day]
When it's the business
And I gotta handle it man and keep it real with you
This is what I gotta do
So I gotta be a man pack my bags let me go
And my dream is to dream so please let me know
If your rolling or not I'm trying to go to the top
Cos I'm a rocker for real you know it or not

Lets go

I'm a rocker I don't give a damn who you are
Cos I'm a rocker what the hell you mad at me for
Man I'm a rocker I don't gotta play a guitar
To be a rocker say I'm a rocker

Now lets rock rock rock lemme see your hands
Lets rock rock rock say lemme see your hands
Lets rock rock rock now lemme see your hands
Lets rock rock rock now lemme see your hands

I was a guy with a simple nine to five five
But I was tired of sorting mail cos of pride pride
So I quit my job and got
Cos I ain't wanna be the man on the side line
And now I'm everybodys screaming my name when I'm in the building
I ain't even thinking the same and that's brilliant
Had to sacrifice everything
And I did it cos I love it I ain't think twice of it
So my dudes and my girls sorry that I had to go
But my dream is my dream and it's best that you know
That I work for the [feddy] yes every single penny
I'm a rocker for real if I ain't tell you already

Lets go

I'm a rocker I don't give a damn who you are
Cos I'm a rocker what the hell you mad at me for
Man I'm a rocker I don't gotta play a guitar
To be a rocker say I'm a rocker

Now lets rock rock rock lemme see your hands
Lets rock rock rock say lemme see your hands
Lets rock rock rock now lemme see your hands
Lets rock rock rock now lemme see your hands

See I'm a man with a dream
A dream with a plan
And my plan was a scheme
And my scheme had a fan
And my fan had the keys
The keys were the [chance]
So
So lemme see your hands

Lemme see your hands
Lemme see your hands
Now lemme see you dance
Lemme see you dance

Now let me let let
Now let me see you dance
Now now let me let let
Now let me see your hands

To be a rocker say I'm a rocker

Lets rock rock rock say lemme see your hands
Lets rock rock rock now lemme see your hands
Lets rock rock rock now lemme see your hands
