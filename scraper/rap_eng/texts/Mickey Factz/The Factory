[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Intro]
When I didn't have nowhere to go
I just kinda, wandered
And I, and I stumbled, I stumbled on this place
It was great

[Verse 1]
Clones go home, slogan for the knowns
Fakers are sight seeing they posing at the thrown
Superstar treatment for the homies in the zone
That's normally alone, I totally condone
Creativity, visually we paint imagery
Scratch the surface, dj symmetry
Put it together and plan out
Let's have an understanding sit down while I stand out
I'm on another planet get down or get ran out
I'm making a statement for those that'll camp out
Artistic
Lines outside of lines this is all cryptic
Original as a paw print when I draw gifted

[Hook]
Welcome to the factory
Where the faculty will treat you like family
A-Amen
The whole world is a fantasy
But over here we turn dreams to reality
A-Amen A-Amen
Welcome to the factory
Where the faculty will treat you like family
A-Amen
The whole world is a fantasy
But over here we turn dreams to reality
A-Amen A-Amen

[Verse 2]
Models, Photographers, Admirers
Sculptors, Thinkers, Followers, Inspirers
Corner to corner the floors filled with oil spills
Not by greedy politicians wanting more bills
I was thinking like magicians but the arts real
It come alive cause the thoughts real
I know the deal so its love
Instilled in my blood
Concealed in a hub
For the real people judged
By the clones and the fakers
Posing as painters
But they don't know a thang about the culture we creating
Uh
Samo on the walls we all decorating
Prepare for this new renovation, MauSe

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When I see Andy & Keith I feel pressure
They sat me down for a real lecture
They said the clones will get ya
Try to etch a sketch ya
Ya style gotta be extra
Delivery & texture
The space inside the loft is rented
They wave price and cost to get in
So maybe I have forced inheritance
Passing down to me all art intelligence
I wouldn't even call this membership
This is life baby
Wrong or right baby
My sight maybe, slight hazy
Cause I write lazy, but its quite crazy
Mickey Cinco scaring all the mice lately
With this paint I'm nicer than a polite lady

[Hook]
