Aye yo Young Noble and yukmouth look homey u assed out when it come to da flow dog i'm tryin to cash out on everything owed to me and then some we live in the slums old heads used to stick us and run knowin damn well
We gon c his ass later when we probly thirty deep turn his body to a crater

The closest nigga liftin his shirt sent to da earth
N now u gotta sit in a church askin the lord for forgiveness 'causez u pulled yours first United Ghettos of America we dealin with this
Relentless statistics it's on some kill or be killed shit

If enemies aproach i dumpin ditches societies most hated
