[Chorus: Lloyd]
I got 5 on it
Bet you walked up
Let me see you walk that walk
I got 5 on it
But she scared of the mack
If you ain't baby, throw it back
I got 5 on it
But you don't even know what
To do with all of that
I got 5 on it
Girl you should throw it all up
Know you'll get it back

[Verse 1: Numskull]
Since my release no more watching police, Numie be watching asses
And scoring every chick from one to ten as it passes
Imagine that, when in two napkins when it's attached to two chains
Tryna control her ass that was made to do thangs
Where my old jeans at, believe me nigga, we still go
We keep it moving, just a automobile slow
Now watch me show her how I go when I get in a crowd
See? They can't tell if your panties is up or they down
Look at me and you, we drunk and we getting it in
And even though we 'bout to cum, we continue to blend
Welcome to Numworld, where not many invited
Just asses in [?], coked out and excited

[Chorus: Lloyd]
I got 5 on it
Bet you walked up
Let me see you walk that walk
I got 5 on it
But she scared of the mack
If you ain't baby, throw it back
I got 5 on it
But you don't even know what
To do with all of that
I got 5 on it
Girl you should throw it all up
Know you'll get it back

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
Zilla
I don't really do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
And I'm both right now, got me tipping on my thighs
Popping bottles make haters say "Fuck your life"
Better handcuff your bitch before I'm fucking on your wife
Fuckboy, I'm in [?] popping that molly
Tipping on every thotty with a body, listen mami
I'm tryna get some head up in the Mase', copy?
She gave me [?]
A lot of thotties and baddies up in this motherfucker
Ass shots, hella fatties in this motherfucker
We cash out, throwing savvy in this motherfucker
No net nigga, Trick Daddy in this motherfucker
Zilla!

[Chorus: Lloyd]
I got 5 on it
Bet you walked up
Let me see you walk that walk
I got 5 on it
But she scared of the mack
If you ain't baby, throw it back
I got 5 on it
But you don't even know what
To do with all of that
I got 5 on it
Girl you should throw it all up
Know you'll get it back
I got 5

[Outro: Yukmouth]
