Nigga, you call it the block, I call it the turf
Whoa, you call it a rock, I call it the work
Yeah, you call it welfare, I call it the first
Niggas call it granddaddy, but I call it the purp'
Yessir, you call it a ki, I call it a bird
Word, you call it the street, I call it a curb
Yessir, you call it the hills, I call it the burbs
And niggas call me kingpin cause I stay all in the dirt
Like Tyrese knee-deep in the dirt, beefin like Smurf
High-tech hustle, fiends beep when they chirp
I'm that nigga that the feds wanna see in the dirt
Cause I be beatin up the block while I be bleedin the turf
The turf is what we call the hood
George Bush is what we call the good
And gatorbacks is what I call the wood
It's understood, I boss up like a baller should
This for my turf niggas trappin out in all the hoods

Gangstas liftin weights on the porch gettin swoll
My hardballs was high, I had to pitch 'em low
Pitch up slow so all my goons could get this dough
Hit the 'dro behind tint grippin on wood
My turf is like yo turf, we live in the hood
Live on the block, live on the streets, live on the ave
This for my turf niggas gettin that cash
On my block
