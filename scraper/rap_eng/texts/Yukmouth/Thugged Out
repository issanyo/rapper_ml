[Chorus: Phats Bossi]
Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out!
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin drugged out!

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Balla position
Regime niggas fuck all'a ya women draped up in linen
I spit this fly shit since I was 5 years old
On some 'ol Osh Kosh Bi'Gosh shit
Toss ya bitch, keep it top secret, lock it
Smoke-A-Lot click, walkin around wit ounces in they pockets
Bitches jock it
We ridin Benz's, ya'll still drivin 50 rockets
Nigga don't knock it
But you need to stop it
Top notch shit
I used to cop bricks
Rock it up an chop like La-Bobbitt
Pushin the 5 whip through the projects til the led 9 spits
Nigga you rhyme sick, but you could never fuck around wit my shit
My click my crew nigga
That hard time shit
Criminal minded, posted on the grind shit
That cone silencer for one time shit
Turnin, pounds into ashes
Drinkin Cristal from the bottle
Fuck ya glasses
Smokin Black-N-Milds to the plastic
The last trial was kinda drastic
Limo driver got his ass kicked, tryin to sue us
BUT YOU LOST YOU FUCKIN BASTARD!
I'm A-1 Yola juss like the package
Delivered in triple wrappin
Niggas get blasted an put in a casket
Ashes to ashes an dust to dust, when they fuck wit Yuk
Plus I got my own record label
SO WHAT THE FUCK IS UP!

[Verse 2: Phats Bossi]
When things is usual we pop Christy
An stack them Bentley's
Ya pockets empty pretending to be me
They name me Bossi
My whole click rich like we the Cosby's
Slippin's costly
It's cut-throat so fuck a softie
In head to head combat
You scared to bust back
An trust that
Call the Regime we known to pull gats in black hats
Hop out the company truck
Give a fuck, fill my cup an celebrate wit Yuk
Now that we grown ups
Rock alligators an bumpin slow cuts
Juss like the Sho Nuff, we can't be touched
I was raised ruff
Gang banged an hand cuffed
Fightin [?] always showin my guts, flexin my nuts
Hand me my 'Uervo
Flip work like we was Trader Joe's from Cisco
Optimo, now it's X-O
Fightin my [?] for death
Pray it's my brother that's kept
When you owe, pay ya debt an we can make it some [?]

[Verse 3: Gonzoe]
We got it bundled up
Gimme my scratch
It's juss my turn an I'mma take mine
Trap
Nigga don't get attached
Tryin to soak up, listenin
Tryin to locate my donuts an hit 'em
While we juss got on fuckin up my buisness
Never finished
Til we give up the plate
Extra innings
Swing for the fence
You think too little
Your world dance wit mud puddles
My shit Evian, I love trouble
Start wisperin wit ya hands wide open, watchin you huddle
Big every down
Everybody got guns, let 'em ring
You fuckin wit me, let's all go out wit a bang
In this last day, this last hour
Kool-aid chest cowards wit they life in my hands set off the power
Lights out
Swiss cheese the whole house
Wit a gallon of gas to douse
Light a flame an flush 'em out
Every slug count
Miss an get your stripes took
Nigga this is real life wit real names written in the black books!

[Chorus: Phats Bossi]
Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out!
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin drugged out!
Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out!
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin drugged out!
Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out!
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin drugged out!
Throw up yo hands if you Thugged Out!
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin drugged out!

[Verse 4: Poppa L.Q.]
(Check it)
Ever since I was a youngsta been wit this slick shit
Tryin to touch a quick one, number one ???
Turn an 18 to a full 36 ain't jokin thats how we did it
We was natural born chemists
Ballin wit this, Benjamin big heads in my fist
Got ya life in my pocket an more than that on my wrist
I got my degree in the concreate of S.C
Comprised wit gettin paper, an started investin in me
Utilized my hustle skills beyond my record deal
And time will reveal whose really holdin the skrill
Playboy ya lackin, ain't touchin my tax brackets
You fuckin wit some thugs, wit some multi-million dollar [?]
An if it's on an crackin then my reaction is clappin
Is you gon' make it happen or is ya high cappin?
Ya betta get to trackin playboy if you ain't packin
Smoke-A-Lot, Regime is distributin max ???
Spent years over the stove in a mini-factory lab
Where illegal pharmaceudicals were sold
I was probably 10 years old when I learned to disassemble
Then reassemble a semi-auto matic pistol blind fold!

[Verse 5: Tech N9ne]
1-5-1
They call me Regime, cuz I'm way clean in stay Beam
Never live in no day dream, bitch niggas wear Maybelline
Throwin up peace cuz you know that I got you
Moolay kwa assalam rahmatuallahi wa barakatuh
Killa!
Rogue Dog! Rogue Dog!
57 venomous!
When I bust this shit got a gang of criminals feelin us
I'm from Waymeyer the same kinda pain caine grinda
Wit a scripta
Stickin out like a skin head at a bar mitzvah
Fuck wit N9ne get snuffed out
Phats Bossi, Maxx, Poppa L.Q., Gonzoe
An my nigga Yukmouth, Thugged Out!
Any nigga wit the bombay
Never con-ways displayed
So-right, so-tight
New York niggas say be John Blazed
I been to the ringa
Scrapped 'em like I was a guest on Jerry Springer
Wit desert eagle, tech meezle
A [?] a nigga, a drop a [?]
I die a lil nigga
Leave 'em wit a 30 round drummer
Slit ya throat then we skip out, "I Know What You Did Last Summer"
Ain't nobody fuckin wit Regime niggas
Bust gats at ya cats makin extreme figures
Get ready for the Rogue Dogs, told ya'll we seperatin yo jaw
Fuckin yo hoes dog
Lickin toes, balls
Makin mutha fuckin clothes fall
Oh! You mutha fuckas dont know!
At the show you trippin, gotta go get the steel toe
To the brain nigga

You really wanna know what time we leave, shit.... [?]
