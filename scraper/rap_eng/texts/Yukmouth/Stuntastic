Yeah, I'm a throwback fanatic, Air Force addict
Hardwood Classic, fitted cap to match it
Jeff Hamilton jacket, NBA patches
Team logos on my Jordans, I'm stuntastic

[ VERSE 1: Yukmouth ]
Boombastic, light a blunt and pass it
Rock a Pippen throwback when he ran with Paxton
Rock a authentic Steve Nash Mavericks
And rock a NBA All-Star 32 Magic
'Bout it, 'bout it, match with every outfit
Got two houses filled with Gucci couches
Manolo Timbs for all my spouses
And my mistress in lipstick and throwback blouses
Huh, I hit the mall and dumb out
For every throwback that come out, until they run out
My teeth shine without the sun out
These color Jordans don't come out
Boy, that's why I ball with my tongue out
Nigga
I'm stuntastic

[ Chorus ]
Throwback fanatic, Air Force addict
Hardwood Classic, fitted cap to match it
Jeff Hamilton jacket, NBA patches
Gucci interior, H2, I'm stuntastic
Throwback fanatic, Air Force addict
Hardwood classic, fitted cap to match it
Jeff Hamilton jacket, NFL patches
Aston Martin with mink carpet, I'm stuntastic

[ VERSE 2: Yukmouth ]
I hit the mall, tell em:
"I want this one, this one and that one
Especially that black one"
Throwback version of Bo Jackson
Throwback Laker befo' Jackson
Then 'hit the freeway' like Tone Braxton
Rappers want beef, the chrome blastin
Leave his dome sackin on his lap
Me fallin off, it won't happen
Boy, get back then with the mack man
I sold crack dodgin cops like Pacman
Rap-A-Lot 'fo life' like Mack 10
This fit won't come out, so stop askin
Iced out like the Aspen in Dapper Dan fashion
Now, Louie, Timbos, Gucci to Benzo
And Jay, Burberry to alligator to limos
Peep the ensemble, who rock the Gucci Matumbo
Throwback with the custom Gucci Ferragamos
And push the throttle in a Marcia Lago
That's the color of the guacamole on your nachos

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 3: Yukmouth ]
I go... on and on and on and
I ball for the team I own like Jordan
Come on, breezy what a singer chick I'm bonin
Platinum CL I'm rollin
Yuk stay... fresh... to impress
In a matchin Mitchell & Ness
Strapped with pistol and vest
Underneat the 43 Jerry West
They know I'm gung-ho with dough, them cats hardly ball
I rock the Kings Archibald to the Mardi Gras
I rock the Isaiah Thomas to the Lost Promise
Toss mama, then forget about her - Alzheimers
Smalltimer to a big-rig, a Shaq Diesel
Larry Bird college throwback, black ( ? )
In a 745 with the frog eyes, multi
Yuk stuntastic like The Fall Guy

[ Chorus ]
