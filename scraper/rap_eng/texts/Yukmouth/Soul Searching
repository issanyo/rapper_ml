(K.M.G.)
Seems never, no hesitation for my frustration
I feel the years that I'm facin', so it's here money track, I'm lacin'
With that Gothic lifestyle that I'm used to, voodoo
Bent back with a bag of gumby and the hindu
Twelve playas, way, beyond control
Lookin' for two or three bustas that done sold they soul
See my name is K.M.G. (Whoop whoop), do ya know me?
I think ya lightweight like your see-through homies
Hold this, while I smoke this, make you focus on the pistol & the chrome
And the homie fly as, California born
We shake down, at the Calabasas home
And when we throw a gathering, ohh baby it's on
See we, shake off the bustas, we got the cops checkin'
Come down on imitators with they fake jail records
Yea, we use our method, our soul searching method
And when we on the block after dark you might catch it
Disrespected? Never that. Cali West Coast bellin'
Check out all my homies with they colors (Blue and red, much love)
Mi amigos, I got my homies daring ya
Moody lifestyle mid from the Bay Area
We like anderson, come ask for free
Soul searching with that nigga K.M.G, (K.M.G.)
Soul searching with that nigga K.M.G. homie, (K.M.G.)
You don't wanna fuck with me...

(Chorus X4)
Why can't you see the light?

(Yukmouth)
Nigga, I was raised in a house full of dope fiends
Admiring ballers who sold cream, my street dream
Like Nas, mansion and four car garage
Keep trust in God with mob niggas in my enterouge
You see that's why could be for broads
I learned that from my pops when we used to mob the eldora-do
Through the muthafuckin' projects, I guess it's in my blood
Sometimes it seems like I'm next, to be a thug
And end up selling drugs like my father
Or like my partner on the block, nigga, when I holler, squattin impalas
Slanging rocks, man, it don't stop
Keeping the Glock up in the cut cuz niggas know I, get sho' stopped
For yo bread, niggas drop dead, of hot lead
"Shot him up" that's what the cops said, a code red
Call the muthafuckin ambulance
Could've ran but then again he never had a chance
For soul chasing...

(Chorus X4)
