[Intro: Jay Rock]
I remember just sittin' in that strap house (strap house)
Yeah, I remember just sittin' in that strap house, should I say the crack house
Steady movin' packs out
I remember just sittin' in that strap house (strap house)
Yeah, I remember just sittin' in that strap house, should I say the crack house

[Hook: London]
If your life (if your life)
Is like mine (is like mine)
You will grind (you will grind)
You will shine (you will shine)
I get mine (I get mine)
Day and night (day and night)
Do it feel (do it feel), oversized (oversized)
Livin' the life, uh, uh
The life, uh, uh [X3]
Livin' the life, uh, uh
The life, uh, uh [X3]

[Verse 1: Ya Boy]
Yeah, we used to be like, damn we need more sluts
Now we feelin' ourselves like, they can't afford us
I never toured much, now I got a tour bus
Wife beater rock star rockin' with ya boy Yuk
Uck! Look like the bay in the building
Banana clips whole bunch of Ks in the building
Nigga don't worry about gettin' grazed in the building
Bodies drop, souls gettin' raised in the building
Ooops, did I go off subject?
I ain't mean to, sometime my brain just does that
Honestly I feel it's the result of gettin' money
Ever since I got my money, feel like everybody want me
But how could I ever forget that everybody loves me
Got the whole west coast ready to ride for me
So nigga, you get mad and Imma get paid
You see, I make bitches, and you just bitch made

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
Okay! It's Yuk!
I get paper, while you player haters stay broke
White S-550 you could go to space, walk
All black Barre Ta, leave you wetter than a rain coat
Comin' for that cheddar like that wells-fargo stage coach
Bank role, bank role, killers on that pay role
Lost in that hate smoke, boss in the Range Rove
Box full of legos, pot full of prego
Yayo like rave 4, ballin' out like mayo
Every single weekend, catch me on the road
New city, new shows, new money, new hoes
New row, bottles poppin' outside new rows
Ride, drive, head, Phantom suicide two doors
Condo and no ho the team get more dough
And on the D-low I don't give a fuck about no ho
Packs of that dough dough
Bricks for the low low
Trunks full of ice cubes, playin' with a yo yo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Yeah! I remember just sittin' in that strap house
Should I say the crack house
Steady movin' packs out
At the table with the Ks and the macs out
Work on the table, got that fire, you can ask 'round
Yeah, but now a nigga rappin' now
Hit the road for 40 days then I'm back in town
Do it big like Godzilla, if God willing
I get billions, come back and buy buildings
Yeah, on the grind for me and my children
We gotta eat cause being broke's a cold feeling
Two stories, money stacked to both ceilings
Skydiving, rock climbing, and boat trailing
Tryin' to take from me, I gotta smoke melons
Bust the head of witness, boy, there's no tellin'
Yeah, the way that I'm shinin' got my foes jealous
Yeah, my money retarded, nigga, I'm so special

[Outro: London]
Livin' the life, uh, uh
The life, uh, uh [X3]
Livin' the life, uh, uh
The life, uh, uh [X3]
