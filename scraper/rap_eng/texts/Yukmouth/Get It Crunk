In the club with our middle fingers up like jump
Now, we gonna make ?em stomp like jump
Niggas get out of line we hit ?em up like

Well, I'm flippin' and grippin' my wood grain steering wheel
I made a mill at eighteen, nigga how it feel
It feel good to cash checks every other day, yes
If you ain't talkin' bout money, go the other way

Miss me with that bullshit dawg, I'm on the grind
You disrespect me while I'm on stage, it's goin' down
Bottles, chairs, whatever I get my hands on
You can bet your bottom dollar they get some

If you think you strong enough to take a shot, jump
I bet you changin' your mind when you lookin' now, jump
These niggas like to talk shit, then apologize, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
You put my name in a verse then I gotta ride

Look I'm a pimp
Mine is the 3 piece suit
My grill the same color as my GT Coupe
Gators snappin' on my feet like they fresh out the jungle

There's a nine in my vest, but it's a tec' in my Hummer
I know I make y'all niggas wonder how I'm gettin' that cash
?Cause when we gotta drop, I ain't spendin' my last
The prices jump

If you out of town and you need a bird jump
I could ban him and blow his brains on the fuckin' curve jump
You don't want beef wit my squad nigga jump
Come out the club off note, you gettin' rob nigga, so jump

Stupid if you wanted dawg
These hollow tips
Gon' put you in a coma dawg
You dig?

Hey, niggas claim they got guns but they ain't shot nobody
Or you a stick up kid why you ain't got nobody? Stop lyin?
Niggas at the bar buyin' shit they can't afford
You think he ballin' until you see his Honda Accord

And tell valet not to scratch my wheel
Or he gon' leave here wit a busted lip
Me and Crime Boss rollin' in my Coupe Deville
I ain't tryin' leave you in but I shoot to kill

Hey, I'm like Jeezy, I trap or die
And I don't pop, pop, I rather fire
I'm a thug and you know it, you damn right I show it
Twenty two's on my lotus just in case you haven't noticed

Oh, oh, oh, you better not jump
Oh, oh, oh, you better not jump
Oh, oh, oh, y'all better not jump

Oh, oh, you fuck around and get jump
Ha, ha, Whoo, shout to my nigga Zab Judah
Floyd Mayweather, Roy Jones, Winky Wright know what I'm sayin'?
What up to my nigga Bernard Hopkins? Yeah, holla at yo boy
