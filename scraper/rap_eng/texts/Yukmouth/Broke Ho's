(Chorus: 1x)
(Girl: You gotta have a J-O-B
If you wanna be with me)
'Cause broke ho's is a no-no
Broke ho's is a N-O, N-O, fa sho

*Girl Talking*
I'm tired of these motherfuckers
Talkin' 'bout broke ass ho's
You motherfuckin' right I'm a broke ass ho
Breakin' your motherfuckin' ass off every time I see you
I needs my cash, mayne
I gotta have it, gon' have it, gon' get it

[Verse 1]
(Yukmouth)
Who's the mack? I'm the mack, you's the mack
Kickin' a gangsta limp and pimp like Pretty Tone
Now it's your herringbone I'm wearin home

(Numskull)
Dearly beloved, I'm so low-budget, no gold nuggets
Chillin', we're in the two door Cutlass, same ol' bucket

(Yukmouth)
I love it when them bitches call me J.J
'Cause I'm the bay-bay, them bitches come visit on pay day

(Numskull)
To get checks to buy leather coats, that's why I'm solo
'Cause broke bitches is a no no

(Chorus: 1x)

*Girls talking*
Bitch, that's just like when that nigga took me to Vegas
His fat ass fell asleep
I got him for his Rolex, and his car keys (Whaat!)
Mobbed his shit back to the town
Sold his triple gold ones for a playa's price (HAHA!)

(Verse 2: Yukmouth)
My balls been off the wall like Michael, psycho
Therapy to carry me, and felt me
A bitch can't help me less that bitch wealthy
'Cause they ain't shit but hoes and tricks
So I goes and get a bitch that's foldin' grip
That love to buy niggas clothes and shit
Vogues and shit, for my hooptie, Gucci link
Me don't want a broke ass hoochie 'cause they coochie stink
Think, while your fa sho sho bitch is a no no
Niggas kick down you do' with fo'-fo'
She got your ass licked at the mo'-mo'
Don't know why ya go trustin' the bitch
'Cause she suckin ya dick but he fuckin ya bitch in the mix
But don't get it twisted, these bitches be broke as fuck
Knowin' on the under they be posted up
Sellin' butt on O'Farrell, make dinero, cash
Or get a eight-and-a-half up yo' narrow ass
I lay my pimpin' down like Ron O'Neal, chill in the village
Deal wit' more clean dope fiends than Willis
Broke bitches feel this

(Chorus: 2x)

*Girls talking*
Oohhh, bitch, ain't that Num from the Luniz?
(Yeah, I heard that motherfucker got hella scrilla)
Huh, you ain't knowin'? I'mma set the motherfucker up
Get him high, give him some sunshine pussy
And the money all mine (Ooh, yeah)

(Verse 3: Numskull)
I wanna fuck and that's it, after that, split
I didn't kiss ya 'cause ya breath smelled like shit
I only stayed 'cause you was lickin me
But then I got fed up because ya dookie braids was stickin me
Ya lookin like ya from the blue lagoon
But I ain't trippin 'cause I know that you'll be leavin soon
Bitch, you only with me cause you think dat I'm rich
You fucked twenty mo' niggas and come to me sayin you got the itch
But I ain't got it, punk, I used a jimmy
(Uh-uh, 'member that day we was fuckin' to Humpty Hump?)
Yep. The rubber broke, and I jumped, hit my head on the lamp
'Cause I was amped, off the drank and the hamps

(Chorus: 3x)
