(Yukmouth talks over the chorus)

(Chorus)
One into the two, two into the four
The Game want war, The Game got war
(Breathe!)
Four into the five, let The Regime ride
Game ride wit them, the game ova for them
(Breathe!)
One into the two, two into the four
G-Unit want war, G-Unit got war
(Breathe!)
Four into the five, let The Regime ride
Game ride wit them, the game ova for them
(Breathe!)

(Gonzoe)
It's war time, You bitches understand me
There's no fist fightin'; on sight I'ma blam you
Smash niggas' face with gun handles
You know me the definition of the land of the scanners
You pose for the camera
I carry my own blamma
Bury niggas with Chucks on with wooden pyjamas
On the hood you square
Death is a promise
No niggas know you from the jungles to the bottoms
'cause' you had contacts tryin to GQ model
I was born with Pac, in the OE-bottle
You're a dick rider
Tryin' to fuck with which crews hotta
Match your tongue ring to the paint on your Impala
You're just another fuckin' clone
You maric√≥n
Gettin' shitted on
For shoes and cell phones
You dead wrong, nigga, sayin' Yuk ain't safe
From E-1-4 to the Shaws There's a price on your face, you bitch!

(Yukmouth)
Bitch Nigga!
You can't fuck wit us Regime life nigga?!
How dare you say Tha Regime on your fake ass skit?!
How dare you use "5 on it," you fake ass nigga?!
You ain't got no plaques on your wall!
You ain't got no money, you bitch!
You at yo momma house, you punk!
You tongue ring queen!
Nigga!
You can't fuck with me man!
Stay off the internet, you computer thug!
You don't want it, nigga!
You don't want war, you bitch!

(Chorus starts)
Joe Budden murdered you!
And Yuk gon dead yo ass, nigga!
I'ma whack yo bitch ass, punk!
You already know how we rock, nigga
You just got your first tattoo 2 years ago, nigga!
When JT found you, you were tryin to be a G-Q model!
You thought you was the next LL
REMEMBER!?
Remember you was saying that, you bitch?!
Be real!
Punk...
Fake ass blood...
Nigga!
