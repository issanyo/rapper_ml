Smash niggas face with gun handles
You know me the definition of the land of the scanners

Bury niggas with chucks on with wooden pyjamas
On the hood (Breathe!) you square
Death is a promise
No niggas know you from the jungles to the bottoms
Cause' you had (Breathe!) contacts tryin to G-Q model
I was born with Pac, in the OE-bottle
You're a dick (Breathe!) ryda
Tryin' to fuck with which crews hotta
Match your tongue ring to the paint on your Impala
You're just (Breathe!) another fuckin' clone
You maricone
Gettin' shittin' on for shoes and cell phones
