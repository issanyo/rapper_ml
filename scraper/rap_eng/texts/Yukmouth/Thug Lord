[Chorus]
Thug Lords
Holdin' the chopper in the sky, nigga (Bust Yours)
All my niggas, they down to ride for the (Thug Lords)
Nigga that cross me, his ass gon die, my nigga (Bust Yours)
Them niggas (Want War)

[Verse 1]
I'm glad you said it, now you old ass rappers gon get it
Been in the business twenty seconds, held down eleven
J., you better tell these fuckin peasants, you wet me, you get wetted
Even your fuckin ______, get detted
Fake ass synthetic, poetic emcees get shredded
Styles pathetic, I move to Texas, take all your letice
I got a six-million dollar fetish, that's what it takes to build me
I know you wish some niggas peel me, and drill me
You better pay a nigga to peel me, and kill me
Fill me 'til the shit the empty, play it filthy, put a hundred slugs in me
Spot a nigga out like Spuz Mc Kenzie, the thug is in me
My spare time, I rhyme, drink Remy, load up the semi
I was born to slap the shit out of macks, take their bitch
Run up in their studio, duct tape their clique
A smilie face ain't shit, if you got Yuk in your mouth
My nuts in your mouth, how does it feel to get fucked in your mouth?
Niggas ridin' Bentley's, your artist stuck in the house
Starvin', broke as fuck in the apartment, stuck in the south
I'm weighed out, niggas some where in Germany, burnin' weed
Learnin' these foreign languages, tourin'
Allways performin' like Laryn Hill, my shit's sore as steel
I'm real, like Slim Shady, bitch quit ignorin' skills
I kill, niggas better stop smokin fry, and poppin' pills, I drill
But all you muthafuckaz, I'm the illest nigga, I feel
Fuck a record deal, the game is fake
My nigga Coolio said "Fuck 'em", start sayin' names and dates
Make 'em hate the "One Hit Wonder"
This time, my shit hit like thunder, in the Hummer, nigga, the MOB took me under
Try'na be mack niggas, stay your ass in Atlanta
Old ass rappers, make Oakland look bad like Hammer
Niggas dissin Yuk, sayin' they don't like my shit
Then turn around and say "Yuk, help me write my shit"
Ain't that a bitch?

[Chorus]
Thug Lords
Holdin' the chopper in the sky, my nigga (Bust Yours)
All of my niggas, they down to ride for the (Thug Lords)
The nigga that cross me, his ass gon die, my nigga (Bust Yours)
Them niggas (Want War)

[Verse 2]
If them niggas ain't down wit gettin' cream, fuck 'em
And if them niggas ain't down wit the Regime, fuck 'em, I rush 'em
Aim at their limosine, buck 'em, I never loved 'em
I never trust them, nigga I crush 'em, old antiques I dust 'em
And fuck 'em off in the game like so
Nobody _____, fuck wit my flow, not even you stole my hydro
My main objective: "Take this bitch over"
They gon make me vice president before this bitch over
Beware of the Ayatolla, come and shut you down
Make you exit out of town, who got the best shit now?
Nigga, you know your ass was in Tha Row, what side you on?
That's why I'm doin' my next song with Eightball and Bone

Bitch, (ha ha ha ha)Thug Lord (ha ha ha, yes)
