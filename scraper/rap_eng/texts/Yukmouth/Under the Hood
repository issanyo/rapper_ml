[Specifics]
Hit with a dilemma
A dip with an umbrella at my cellar
Let her in quick, the medicine sip, whatever
I'm clever on some accapella shit, that's my main strength
But never been too bad, as well, uh, at this gettin brains thing
I think the light's dim
Not the type to fight gin
And bent like, psyched to hit the bed and strike skins
Right then the phone ringin, but left it-
Blowing in the night
Like the west wind crescent
My preference is a heavy snare yes, instead
Of some soft shit
Got a sweaty pair of breath mints
The stars be glowing, We spark weed, holdin
Hands and, uh
Gold be the cardio and stamina
Top physical condition when I'm kissin
Switchin' my footwork, I cook birds chicken
She took off my cardigan, she told me start again
I'm gettin more bad bitches than Mad
Martigan
With no candles, R&B stanzas or glamorous clothes
I rock no-brand sandals
I'm dealing with fans, you're dealin with man-hoes
It's romance - and more porn than Sancho
I never snuff lights
And Havin' rough nights, but I must live up to my rep, right?
Touch ice, but my blood warm
Snuff any nickname, when he gets semi-drunk
It's a fuck-storm
And some more couldn't hurt
Mix up love and war like porn, rum and Pepsi One for a
Skirt
Yikes, but I just wanna get done nicely - and
Yo girl your skirt's what entice me

[Hook 2x]
Yo, I'm a do it like this -
Ask you if you love it so, if so, it's on
And boo, if you love his flow, it's Gold, and yo
It's all good
Whatcha runnin' under the hood?

I heard it through the grapevine
Word's groupies got the eyes on the crew
And psyched to get attached loosely at the waistline
Booty makes my day, yo
The bassline boogie nights
Gotsta groove crazy with them cutiepies
Seventies shit
You bet me, I will never be rich
I need to get me a celebrity bitch
Cheque
The kid can't afford Hennessy
But swish many more cheap 40's than you weak whores will ever sip
And rap effortless
Blessed with a certain effervescence
The better beef-curtain spreader specialist
Specifics, Yo, don't get it twist
Drove chicks to my coastal getaway ocean precipice
Tryin' to get to paradise
No asparagus, just a pair of dice, dominos and some Sheridan's
Solid gold providence
In the hottest nights, get the halls hyped wall to wall with a squad of hoes
And all of this
A life of pantyhoes, expansive heights, patios and random fights
Yo my boys got cameos
Dance in the rain with phantoms- all happy like we back again
I could never end it better than the last LP
So take a picture actually
Let the image help me
Remember when it fade, like a dream And I
Pass my name, and dash off yo to rap with
Demons
