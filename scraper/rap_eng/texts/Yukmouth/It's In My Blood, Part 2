Can't forget my niggas who live on the north side

Chorus *(Yukmouth)*

It's In My Blood
Smokin sweets, drink 40's to the suds
And fuckin wit these thugs nigga

And out there sellin drugs nigga

That drug money, stuff that shit up under the rug
And make them cops bug nigga

Niggas like me turn niggas like you into hustalas
Fuckin wit thugs, fuckin wit us!

Verse 2 *(Yukmouth)*

Regime life
Shit trife nigga
Slangin China white at night
Get light nigga
2 point 2 pounds of white
My shit tight nigga
What yo grip like?
Ship like a half a million when I'm fuckin wit mics
Bustin on mics
Wit 5 mics to back it
Kick the acrofacts on the cracks while my nigga D flip it backwards
Regime killas nigga
The captain
The king of crack and still rappin, bubble up makin moves
You niggas still jackin
That's why I'm livin ill, steel packin
Dive on top of niggas and feel like Action Jackson, wit my 9 mill
Blastin
A real assassin, juss invite me to your mansion homie
I bet a nigga'll come back that same night as a mask man demandin money
Pandamony
See my fam is hungry
Eat a can of phony emcees, then dump they ass in San Antoni
Cuz niggas bologney like Oscar Myers
Mobb attire
Makin cops retire the way I, hurdle over barber wire
Fence this
I pimp shit
Relentless
The Guiness Book World Record holder, for fuckin over the most bitches
Regime shit, the thug preachable
Individual-ly, put niggas faces up on the obituals
I was taught to get the doe
It's In My Blood since I was crawlin on the rug
And pops was in the kitchen rockin up drugs
Yes sir!
Back then, I knew who I was, a thug
And still a thug until they make me feel the slugs nigga
It's In My Blood!

*(Chorus)* 2x
