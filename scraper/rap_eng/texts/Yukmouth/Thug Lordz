[Verse 1: C-Bo]
Check, my Uzi weigh a ton I hits 'em up an I run
I'm loco, I keep a guns caulked in the lo-lo
I'm King Tut of the hood
Cuz everytime I drop a record dog
Shit I bring it to the gut of the hood
An I ain't never backed down, so don't test me dog
Cause I'm a nut, an keep a Smith & Wesson pressed in pause
All these faggot ass rappers keep yappin they jaws
Yeah they the shit cuz when they see me they just crap in they drawers
Yeah that nigga 50 he hot, but I heard he's a snitch
And he ran up under that white boy, I heard he's a bitch
An I ain't seen him in the hood, no where in the Valley
No House of Blues, or Peanuts, he scared of them alleys
Heard he copped his rims and Big O Tires in the hood
Surrounded by police, wearin wires in the hood
Heard they ran him outta New York, and he's comin to Cali
No Glocks and Sigs, just lots of pigs
Eh nig, your rap career will not outlast Pac and Big's
Yeah you fuckin wit some kids that ain't scared of the bricks
You in there, four-fifth kick dead in the bricks
Thug Lordz'll have ya hit, split dead in a 6, c'mon

[Chorus: C-Bo]
THUG... LORDZ!
Gettin this money like a motherfucker ready for war
We'll never snitch
Never flip
Never quit my click was heaven sent wit Mac-11's to
Hit when we dip they holla..
THUG... LORDZ!
Gettin this money like a motherfucker ready for war
We'll never snitch
Never flip
Never quit my click was heaven sent wit Mac-11's to
Hit when we dip they holla..

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
Yeah..
If the boss wants you dead, then it's off wit ya head
'specially a bitch nigga that talk to the feds
'specially a bitch nigga that walk wit the feds
To award shows cause niggas bout to toss him some lead
You niggas think the West coast is just Dre an Xzibit
They aiight, but pay attention Thug Lordz handle they business
We the realest from the Gardens to the Village
Make the hardest niggas feel this
Make the Sergeant want to kill us
Regardless Godzilla will murda you nigga
I twist ya cap like a Schlitz malt liquor for that slick talk nigga
If ya nigga gang bang, don't crip walk nigga
Wearin a big chain will get ya ripped off quicka
We the only Thug Lordz bitch
After all big faces like Mount Rushmore, you don't want war bitch
That'll get you pistol whipped an extorted
You lucky I wasn't on Face shit, I woulda destroyed it
You better run like Forrest Gump in Air Forces
Cause our guns look like torches, bustin from drop Porsches
Or the drop Ferrari, hotter than a hot tamale
The T-H-U-G-L-O-R-D'z holla..

[Chorus]
THUG LORDZ!
Gettin this money like a motherfucker ready for war
We'll never snitch
Never flip
Never quit my click was heaven sent wit Mac-11's to
Hit when we dip they holla..
THUG LORDZ!
Gettin this money like a motherfucker ready for war
We'll never snitch
Never flip
Never quit my click was heaven sent wit Mac-11's to
Hit when we dip they holla (they holla)
