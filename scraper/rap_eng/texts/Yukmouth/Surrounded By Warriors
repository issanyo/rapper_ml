[Intro/Chorus]
(“Oh my gosh!”)
(“Oh my gosh!”)
We surrounded by Warriors
(“Oh my gosh!”)
Come out and play, y’all don’t worry us
(“Oh my gosh!”)
No matter what, we victorious
(“Oh my gosh!”)
And the movement is Luni
(“Oh my gosh!”)
We surrounded by Warriors
(“Oh my gosh!”)
Come out and play, y’all don’t worry us
(“Oh…”)
We victorious

[Verse 1: Numskull]
I’m in that blue and gold in The Town with a 30 reppin’ Curry
It’s a Looney on the team and he got 5 on his jersey
The three’s so purty, we lead so early
‘Cause Green making ‘em miss like we miss Furly
We blow ‘em out with this Pachulia plant here
You in the Oracle, stop thinking Durant Square
You come to Oakland, you get surrounded by the Bay (Come on)
(Vallejo! Frisco! San Jose!)
You might get iggy for your dala’s in the Hay’
Have you hot off the bench, livin’ stunnas (I should say)
And you might get a shot off, but droppin’ when it’s nonsense
But we will, ‘cause we shootin’ collection of Klay Thompsons
When you visit, never forget that you a guest
Thinking you Goliath when David’s in the West
On the court or the streets, in the paint or on the corner
(Splash) You surrounded by water—you in California

[Chorus]
(“Oh my gosh!”)
We surrounded by Warriors
(“Oh my gosh!”)
Come out and play, y’all don’t worry us
(“Oh my gosh!”)
No matter what, we victorious
(“Oh my gosh!”)
And the movement is Luni
(“Oh my gosh!”)
We surrounded by Warriors
(“Oh my gosh!”)
Come out and play, y’all don’t worry us
(“Oh my gosh”)
No matter what, we victorious
(“Oh my gosh!”)
And the movement is Luni

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
(Warriors!) Ay, welcome to the Splash House
Splash Brothers, Steph and Klay ‘bout to cash out
K.D. and Draymond going mad house
Sixth man, can’t nobody quiet our fans down
Cannot hear your phone, can’t hear the person sitting next to you
Four All-Stars, oh yeah, that’s what the best’ll do
West’ll do, three after three, I know it’s stressing you
Oh my God, yes Lord, God keep blessing you
Somebody tell Shaq he better quit that hatin’ stuff
‘Cause TNT gotta come to Oakland, they be waitin’, bruh
And we don’t play around in the Bay and that’s a fact
Check the stats, anybody runnin’ up, they getting smacked
Lambo, we push the playoffs mid-February
They say that the Cavs ‘bout to beat us, boy, we never worried
Yes, it’s forever Curry, drip man, Splash King, cheat us just to beat us
Ask LeBron, he the Ak’ king—Warriors, we the best

[Chorus]
(“Oh my gosh!”)
We surrounded by Warriors
(“Oh my gosh!”)
Come out and play, y’all don’t worry us
(“Oh my gosh!”)
No matter what, we victorious
(“Oh my gosh!”)
And the movement is Luni
(“Oh my gosh!”)
We surrounded by Warriors
(“Oh my gosh!”)
Come out and play, y’all don’t worry us
(“Oh my gosh”)
No matter what, we victorious
(“Oh my gosh!”)
And the movement is Luni

[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
Look, Bay don, I’m like Draymond
Catch me in the post and I pass it to Klay to get them treys on
Swish, where they palms, game on
Added Kev Durant to the camp, we get our trey on
Catch me posted at the Oracle
Next to Mistah F.A.B. with a fresh Starter Warrior coat
Whippin’ up coke, they call me Steph Curry
Bake ya boys, ain’t gon’ tell the ref hurry
Burr—ya boy colder than a McFlurry
Blue and yellow jersey with the quick hurry
My nigga Num, we got another one
Still got 5 on it, let’s slide another one
We gon’ ride the wave until the summer done
Fresh Steph Curry, shout out to Under Arm’
Three rings, another championship
Leave it up to Yuk and Num to make an anthem to this
I’m sayin’…

[Chorus]
(“Oh my gosh!”)
We surrounded by Warriors
(“Oh my gosh!”)
Come out and play, y’all don’t worry us
(“Oh my gosh!”)
No matter what, we victorious
(“Oh my gosh!”)
And the movement is Luni
(“Oh my gosh!”)
We surrounded by Warriors
(“Oh my gosh!”)
Come out and play, y’all don’t worry us
(“Oh my gosh”)
No matter what, we victorious
(“Oh my gosh!”)
And the movement is Luni

(Go team, team go)
(Go team, team go)
(Go team, team go)
(“As I come back”)
