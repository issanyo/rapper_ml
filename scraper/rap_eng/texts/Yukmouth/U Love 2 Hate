It's that nigga U Love 2 Hate!
Nigga U Love 2 Hate

Nigga U Love 2 Hate
Nigga, I ain't fake!

Verse 1

Before this rap shit
I used to slang crack wit ghetto bastards
Pack automatic gats an kept scratch up under the mattress
Fuck this rap shit
Yay wrapped in plastic everyday practice
Runnin away from task tactics
Hop fences leavin 'em ass backwards
Before this music
I used to be the Ice Cream Man since 1992 biatch!
Don't you hear the mutha fuckin muzik?
I got a head but ain't no screws in it, losin it
Slangin narcotics, them men two steps away from usin it
Abusin it
I moved then it was all bad
It seemed like soon as a nigga moved, then it was all bad
Because of this music, my whole block double crossed me
Got shot in the ass, bra
But ain't no love lost see
Cuz now I have yo ass off the g's
An niggas found off the beach, wit holes up in they body for tryin to
Double cross me
I could move across seas, and outta state
Smokin weed
Hand yo ass an 8 to smoke to the face
Ya still hate nigga

Chorus *(Yukmouth)*

Cuz I'm that nigga U Love 2 Hate
Tell yo bitch it's that nigga U Love 2 Hate
Smoke-A-Lot, Regime, nigga U Love 2 Hate
Album to the face, nigga U Love 2 Hate
Yes, it's that nigga U Love 2 Hate
Young nigga, wit money, U Love 2 Hate
Mutha fuckas lookin at me funny, U Love 2 Hate
Check it
What?
Nigga.... uh

Verse 2

Is it because I went on tour wit Biggie Smalls?
Or is it because yo bitch will to drop to the floor an lick my balls?
Or is it because a nigga sky ball, since juvenille hall?
To make these niggas straight talk shit, about me in front of they
Broads, listen!
Or is it because I'm ridin around in Range Rove's?
4 point 6, G-S 400 on dubb mo-mo's
An both of my shit's got T.V.'s in 'em, what you don't know
What the fuck you grind fo?
Juss to pay note to the nine-four
I'm ridin 9-8 shit
Is that the reason for all the hatred
I flipped Townhouse, you still at mom's house basement
Mad, walkin around tellin my friends I ain't shit
Back when, you used to be that nigga who I smoked my dank wit
Rob a bank wit, because I trust you
Probably take a slug fo you
But now a nigga got no love fo you
Nigga!
Best friends became enemies for centuries
An jealousy juss means you mutha fuckas envy me

Chorus *(Yukmouth)*

Hate
It's that nigga U Love 2 Hate
Labled to the face, nigga U Love 2 Hate
Drugged out, smoothed out, U Love 2 Hate
Poppin Xtacy an shit, nigga U Love 2 Hate
Uh!
I'm that nigga U Love 2 Hate
Tell yo potnas it's that nigga U Love 2 Hate
Playa hate all the time, U Love 2 Hate
What?
Why you hate me nigga?

Verse 3

Uh
Is it because yo bitch love me?
Or is because I stay whipped in all the latest rugby's
Thugged Out, sippin bubbly
"Da Good, Da Bad, Da Ugly", nigga finally livin lovely
Signin autographs
Lil kids run up an hug me
I'm from where they from, I was raised by crackheads an junkies
Highschool flunky
Too busy out there tryin to get my money
Hungry, I had to get it myself nobody dishin fo me
An now my niggas mad, claim that I ain't dishin fo he
But fuck ya'll nigga!
What the fuck you done fo me?
But talk shit behind my back, and try an smoke my weed
Or is it because I used to funk wit $hort an Master P
Hatin niggas after me, but now won't capture me
Nigga you can't even go gold
What the fuck you sold?
Five thousand units, nigga my shit went platinum across the globe
Or is it because these fake ass hoes claim they got my baby
Act shady, an crazy, reverse the game an now them bitches pay me
The day a nigga signed wit Prince J
Got rid of them other niggas, became my own sensai
Smoke-A-Lot, I got to record lable also
Phats, L.Q., Maxx, KeKe, my nigga Gonzoe
Colloso, cheddar to make the nitros soggy
Ridin Harley's, die smokin juss like Bob Marley
I died in the wide open, at the Mobb party
Wit yo eyes open, slugs through yo hard body
Pick up
Cuz it's that nigga U Love 2 Hate
Sincerely yours mutha fucka
U Love 2 Hate!
Yours truly
Done deal
That nigga U Love 2 Hate
