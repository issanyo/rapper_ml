Verse 1

Dear Lord, why did you take my mama?
There's so much drama in my life, didn't have to take my mama
To make me right
Now the only time that I can see my mama
Is after life
I give up everything to see my mama
Come back to life
I even Sacrifice My Life fo mama
Lets reunite
Fuck my wife, fuck this marijuana
I die tonight
Juss to get my last sight of mama
Up in the sky
My lil son, he look juss like you mama
Don't be surprised
On the other side he got my fathers eyes
Jesus Christ apologize to my baby son at night for takin his grandmamas
Life
My mama was sweet when we didn't eat
She could still make us laugh
Even though our ass was livin out on the streets
Cryin for weeks prayin to the Messiah
While the evil get, 25 to life fo' mama dyin in fire
Trapped in a house
Tortured in the worst way
I got her name tatted across my chest for her birthday
But, Lord....

Chorus *(Yukmouth)*

I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my mama back to life
Hear me, Lord
I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my mama back to life
All alone in this, world
I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my mama back to life
Hear me, what?
I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my mama back to life

Verse 2

Dear Lord, why did you take my father?
There's so much drama in my life, and now you take my father
That shit ain't right
All he wanted to do was be a balla
Sniff China white
After, after hours of other ballas
Bettin on the dice
Give up my life juss to see my father
Lets reunite
He was my friend, I was his little potna
Big brother type
Didn't give a fuck what my mother like
When y'all broke up
Me and my father was so fuckin tight
She had to show love
I never knew when I grew up that I be juss like you
Smokin bud
Sellin drugs, and hustlin juss like you
Nigga I'm a Terminatior 2 of you though
You in a grave
Died from AIDS, some man made shit, an still they hate I'm gettin paid
I miss my father and my mother
So do yo sisters and yo brothers
My son he miss his grandmother
Can't even sit on his grandpas lap for Christmas
I got the riches
But got nobody to share my shit wit
What is this?!

Chorus

Lord
I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my father back to life
Hear me, Jahova
I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my father back to life
One mo time. Uh
I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my father back to life
God
I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my father back to life

Verse 3

Why did you take my grandma off this earth?
She had to be the sweetest woman to ever walk this earth
It sho hurts
My whole earth, Queen of the Universe
This the first time we don't get to celebrate Thanksgiving dinner at
Grandma's church
See, when my mama died she took me in
Even when my mama was alive she took then, straight put me in
A spare room in the house to live wit her
Young dirty nigga didn't have no money or nothin to give to her
But still I lived wit her for 6 years
Then she died now it's juss tears
It seems like I'm the only one in the family left here
Trapped in this cold-hearted crazy world
Me, my wife, and my son
I'm parinoid to have a baby girl
Cuz life is fucked up, because of your prayers, I lived up
Became successful
Now that I got the money it seems that I stress mo'
Sometimes I wanna let go
In my life, do Heaven really got a ghetto?
Sacrifice my life

*(Chorus)*

God
I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my grandma back to life
Hear me, Lord
I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my mama back to life
All alone in this, world
I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my father back to life
Ya hear me, God?
I sacrifice my life, juss to bring my dead potnas to life

One love
Uh
Fo all my dead potnas (yes)
Fo my relatives, (rest in peace) my mom's, my pop's
My grandma (I love you)
I'ma see y'all when I get there, at the Pearly Gates
I do this fo my nigga... from the S. and V
My nigga SEAG, and my nigga Rappin' Ron
My nigga Tupacalypse
And my nigga Biggie Smalls
Everybody that lost a loved one.... Sacrifice your life
To bring 'em back to life
Sacrifice your life
We gone see 'em, don't worry
Eternal life.... we see 'em in the next life
Done deal
