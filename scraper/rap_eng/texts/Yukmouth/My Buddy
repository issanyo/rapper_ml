Me and You

(Daz) And you know that

Me and You

(Daz)
Who can fade it, two assassins up on the mic
Blastin', askin' no questions, when they catch you in a gunfight
Kaboom! We still mash as a team
As we mash for our dreams, ? hood niggas for green
It's Dillinger, fulfillin, makin a low outta killin
Pullin' scandalous ? fulfillin fantasy dreams
Catch me on a Costa Rica, with an island full of weed
Money and bitches, on a boat for Sweden

(Numskull)
See when I'm yellin'
International help me
No colorlines on my
Ugly and fine
You can sell me
I'm glad folks think the same way as I do
Cause I stab bitches way down in the Bayou
Would you make way for two mo'
Fo' blows, like you have hoes
Stamp a nation wide through the ghetto
Fore youngsters, Hennesy sponsors
With fore youngsters on a
Quarter of the map now I do

(Daz)
I spin mayor loot and khaki suits
Nike's and cripsacks
Wetsuits and leather boots
I block niggas twice with thighs
Buck with a .45
Make you open while you blast at the parking lot

(Numskull)
What you speakin' on
Wanna go through it
Drink a lot, made from fluid
Scrump bitch, don't you hear the music
My buddy, Daz Dilly and Numskull
You will be thanked
With you're petty pang petty

Chorus: repeat 2X
To all my niggas.. and all my bitches
Throw your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck
Like we don't give a fuck then
Throw your motherfuckin hood up in the air

(Kurupt)
Check it out
No bitch ass niggas, no funny ass hoes
Dogg Pound Gangstas drippin' in low-lows
You ain't all about the homies
You besta check the fault
Pencils, playin niggas in the crowd style
Thinkin bout the row outta town
With the heater cock bust a million rounds
Dogg Pound international's breakin off fools
While the dock can bust
The facility touch

(Yukmouth)
I laid this game down
Jumped around and kissed myself like I was James Brown
Spin around and hit the splits on the ground
Split your motherfuckin crown
Turn this ifs into pounds
Dogg Pound live around
Niggas hittin' the ground
Fuck around and get shot up
I tear shit up
You can ask Puff
Lil Cease, Mary J. B. and Jodeci
About that nigga Yuk
Means the hardcore
Got kicked off tour
For piss marking on the hotel floor

(Kurupt)
G riders, We ride, DP ride
Get the mashin niggas
Or the mat see automatic
Get the blastin niggas
Shakin nigga, bankin nigga
Quit the heater
Stop blankin niggas

(Yukmouth)
I'm danked out
Surrounded by weed smoke
You See me and my niggas in the club
Thugged up, suited in steet clothes
We roll, cut dough
Cause weed so
On triple gold, see hoes
With weed with me and my amigo

Chorus 2X

(Knumbskull)
Who did that, who shitted
Who spoke on the ghetto values
Who supa-dupu flyyyyy
I catored to the pimps, players, hustlers and bastards

(Kurupt)
Why don't you meet me over in the O, Homie
Cause when I get there
The hoes will be all off on me
I know y'all got a gang of bitches...

(Daz)
...Ha, ha
And like fabulous thangs and livin' life expensive
In nights machine dippin'
With a pocket full of c-notes
Cruise the block with a 9 lookin' for weed-o
And oh yeah, who got the gangsta shit
Daz and Kurupt, Numskull, Yuk for shit bitch

(Yukmouth)
Known as your playa potna
Slain ice cream fools and (?)
Rockin Hilfiger just like kadada
I walk around the house of rockwilder
Just like a mobster
The O-A-K bust and throw it away
Hoop out the roof down in LA
And then go aloof
Opps! and make a nigga spooked
With a couple of screws loose
And find your homie
Sweatin, buck naked locked up in a chicken coop
Why?
Livin that destory all arts
Zark, and blast a homes
Pull back and grab your mothafuckin heart out your chest
If you tested the best like David Koresh
Get ready to be
Reincarnated in the motherfuckin flesh
Yes yes

Chorus 2X
