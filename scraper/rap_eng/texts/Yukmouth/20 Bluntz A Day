Verse 1 *(Numskull)*
You know what I came to do
Came to drink wit a gold face same as you
Drop a fifty on the bar
For a fifth of Hindu
Got freaks wit me gotta get gin too
I know hoes think the same as me
Cuz they came to the club lookin like freak nasty
Pullin niggas on the floor
Dance nasty as you wanna
Rub-a-dub-dub
Lap dance in the corner
Same ol shit
Same ol hits
Same ol click
Same ol dick
Bitch don't look in my eyes
Cuz I ain't payin
Ya shoulda known pimpy-doo niggas ain't playin
Juss pull down yo drawls so a nigga can see
Cuz I doubt that the pussy is fuckin wit me
Pop a coochie to the back
Pop a coochie to the front
But damn, open yo thighs pick up my nigga BLUNT
What ya really want
What ya really need
Pop the breaks on that shit an lets get keyed
Girl I always pictured you in neon lights
Big 44 double D's
What a sight
You an me both we can get respect
Two triple shots of hin an we'll be on deck
You my type
You ol ho
You my type
You know

[Chorus: Christion]
Hin, an ala-zae, I'm feelin like I wanna hurl
Hin, an ala-zae, I think I'm gonna leave this world
Hin, an ala-zae, I been drink-a-lot all day
Hin, an ala-zae, that's why I'm lookin this way
Hin, an ala-zae, I think I need a lil mo
Hin, an ala-zae, send yo mama to the store
Hin, an ala-zae, I can't keep my vision straight
Hin, an ala-zae

Verse 2 *(Yukmouth)*

ZAE??

Smoke-A-Lot, Smoke-A-Lot
Why you smoke??
20 blunts a day, you don't choke
Why bitches doggystyle, nut down yo throat
Get up while my dick on yo coat
An I'm bumpin Too $hort
Down the block
Three on fourth
My nigga Num drunk on the porch off a mutha fuckin quart of O.E.,
Nickle an dime ass nigga
To a top hat balla
Big rigga like E-Fourtee
Niggas know me
Smoke-A-Lot only smoke weed, blow trees
Whole keys
See me in a E-3 dub
Rollin sweet up, everytime you see Yuk
Peep us
Only bad bitches beep us
Turn yo main squeaze into a cheata
Smokin reefa
Took off my DK's
An she fucked us up wit the whole sneaka
An her pussy
Lift yo ass cheeks up so I could see
Mix the hashes up wit the back yard boogie
Woogie
Bust nuts on yo Donna Carra hoodie if it's all goodie

Breakin trees up
Rollin weed up
On my way to the V-up
To put the g's up

Hella high, tinky eyed like Korea

[Chorus: Christion]
20 blunts a day, I been gettin high all day
20 blunts a day, an the blunts get bigger
20 blunts a day, excuse me if my eyes are glazed
20 blunts a day, that's why I'm lookin this way
20 blunts a day, eenie-meenie, minie-mo
20 blunts a day, sticky, sticky indo
20 blunts a day, step aside an let me blaze
20 blunts a day
Blazed

*(2 live Crew)*

[Verse 3: Brother Marquis]
Do it on the way to San Jose
20 blunts a day from the dock of the Bay
Niggas I'm scratch
But they call it Killa Kali
I'm walkin through the spot in my crocodile ballies
20 bag please
20 Deep East
I finna smoke a stanky an get high as a tree
Wit my dime piece mommie
Queen bees keeper
When the bitch shake her ass
Nigga you should see her
Wit a taped on braclet
Diamond laced watches
Mosskimo jeans
Wit her condoms in the pocket
The bitch is real bad in a drop-top Jag
Sittin on chrome shelf on paper tag
Slidin off g-string off in a coach bag
Dolla sign eyes, an a stash full of hash

[Verse 4: Fresh Kid Ice]
Back to the side where niggas blaze
Home of the crew, an the booty shake
Straight packed club where the hoes be poppin
Dick all hard, tryin to shake a lil sumpthin
Lookin fo the one that'll do me right
Who keep me cummin all through the night
Ain't no pitty if you fall to your knees
Fuck me
Suck me
But nigga please
Let a nigga hit it
Bitch I know you wit
From the back, cuz my dicks all in it
I stick it in, like it ain't no thang
Dick stay hard
OD'd on Ginseng
Come an be my private dancer
A playa like me is yo only answer
Holla at yo boy if you wanna play
I got hoes from Miami, up to the Bay. (echos)
