[Verse 1]
Nigga, If I stop ballin, dig it, I better be on top again
Drinkin Henessy on the rocks again
Paper choppin 10s and 20s with plenty of bitches up on my jock
My friends been born riders since the age of 10
I wanted a schwinn so I copped a schwinn
I wanted a benz so I copped a benz
I wanted to fuck her partner friend so I got em up in a menage a trois
But the consequence them broads fell in love with each other
Left me up out the wind
