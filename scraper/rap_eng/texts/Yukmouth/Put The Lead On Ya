[Intro]
What the fuck is this??
They're for the bullet holes, puta!!!
{*gun shots*}

[Hook 3X]
Unload the barrel and laugh
'Cause I'm puttin' lead in yo' motherfuckin' ass

[Verse 1: Numskull]
I'm broke as fuck in this life that I'm livin' in
I'm watchin' niggas bubble and the jealousy is kickin' in
I wanna pull licks but that jail scene don't fit me
Let's bet on the set, I'm a vet runnin' from Fifty
It spell out, so I'm a post to the fullest
Only servin then, the Ice Cream Man is out again
It's jealous niggas on the lurk still
We had a treaty, so now they goin back on they first deal
(Awww now they ready to put the lead on ya
How would you like it if a nigga was broke and came fed on ya??!!)
That's why I'm still on my P's an Q's, readin fools
I'm known as a shyster deceivin' fools (Secret Agent Man)
Snoopin' around found trouble
For tryin' to fuck up a nigga bubble
Don't bubble more than he got
'Cause now he know that if he get rid of you
Then that's more cash in the pot
I got a rival now
The turf is showin what it's worth
I gotta pack a gat for survival now
They just won't let me be, all I can be
So all I can see is victory
I'm struggle master, so
The doo-doo that you do will only make me wanna bubble faster
Don't party-poop 'cause this troop came fed-eral
Slappin' hoes in they neck just to let em know
It's all clear now why, it's so hard to say goodbye
You broke, I'm gettin' high
Don't make me put the lead on ya

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 2: Dru Down]
Here I come, I'm outta jail, fresh in the air
Nigga need a come up, so nigga didn't care
So let me think, nigga, I need to pick up pace
Nigga need a lick, nigga need a safe, so uh
Let me get straight down to business
I need me some distance to run when I carry gun
And I'mma be like quick on my feet
You try and be a hero, my nine milli you will meet
And even if you're the chief of police
Nigga, you will still catch some heat
'Cause I'm just...(one of the killaz in the town)
And niggas know they call me Dru muthafuckin' Down
So homie step back, this is a jack
Nigga make a move and that ass will get tapped
Because I'm loaded, I'm loaded off the dank weed
And jackin' you will get me high just for free, see
Just call me...S-I-C-K
I love to kill for play, 'cause like Cube, it was a good day
And I'mma be like strictly on my Q's
P's and Q's of puttin' quarter holes in fools
So don't you even fuck with my rep
My rep's too big and deeper than Dig-Dug digs
And I'mma get ya, nigga, if I want ya
I got a gun, you rotten nigga, I'mma pop ya
Because I'm broke, I need to feel me some ends
Give me yo' pocketbook so I can break it in
I want your Wells Fargo, Bank of America
And if you're a woman, don't think I still won't put the lead on ya
BEEITCH!

[Hook 4X]

[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
Hell yeah I'm on welfare, G.A. checks
Keeps me paid like a muthafuckin' vet on the set
Let, my mail stretch, it gets up
To the point where even my bitch be choppin' zips up
I whips up the cream
Twenty-eight grams on the triple beam
Chev' sittin' clean (How much slam?)
Four-fifteens, and the Zapco
The rap go, he slipped and made a weak move
Don't sleep, dude, I pull licks every week fool
But ain't no Bonnie and Clyde, nigga
'Cause if a bitch set up a lick, I get the money and slide, nigga
I hit the crap game first thang, leave if your shot short
'Cause bein' broke is the worst thang
Check this out, mayne, 'cause you know I ain't that type niggie
I scoop the dice, once or twice, then the riggie, riggie
Dangle roll shot, is a fa sho shot, dope shot
I mean, it's so hot, I'm snatchin hella fades from the pot
I got the Glock, sixteen on my waist just in case
Never hit 6-8's, so the eight is in the gate
When I shake the dice-a, nother one bites the, dust
They mad as fuck gettin' struck by the shyster
I shoulda known, 'cause rule number one:
Never roll craps with some niggas on a track you ain't from
They done, claimin' they broke, but they forgotten
That I got they mail, and I can tell they plottin'
But shhhhitt, they'll get licked like a popsicle
Don't fuck around and get sent to the hospital
Little niggas think they slick, but they already saw it
Poppin' that "Y'all tape hella raw" shit
Let me raise up from these cowards' turf
Yeah, 'cause little do they know what's below the Eddie Bauer shirt
Niggas mean muggin' me but what that do
I'm a soldier til it's over, 6-5 on my tattoo, punk
So if you want funk you'll be a dead homie
'Cause I'll be damned if you pull a 2-elev' on me
Now all the niggas gettin' lit up
I told ya leavin' yo' house without yo' strap is a rigg up
'Cause I'mma put the lead on ya
Punk ass nigga
