Man, hey you ever had a mother fuckin' wet dream man?
That shit is crazy man (Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch)
Fuckin' dreams man
Fuckin' these industry bitches man (Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch)
In my dream these bitches ain't about shit though
You feel me, oh boy

(Yukmouth)
I fucked 'em all from models to center folds
To rented hoes in videos
Bitches in thinner clothes
I used to wanna fuck the leader of En Vogue
Before the Benzo when I was 10 years old
Now I wanna fuck Free
Take her from A.J. and Luda
Stick a dick through her
Pipe her down like Rotor Rooter
Make the bitch maneuver
My jewel'll keep me iced out like Rick the Ruler
Then I fuck J.Lo, Trina, Beyoncé
All in a ménage
Off X and broccoli
And I got Missy ass waitin' in the hallway
I'm not a minute man fat bitch
I fuck all day
I take Sadé
Get head on the highway
Then fuck that little Mexican bitch from "Next Friday"
I take Tyra Banks from Chris Webber
And fuck her and Vivica Fox both together
West Coast forever
Now what's fuckin' wit that?
I need gangsta love
So I fuck even Da Brat
Alicia Keys in the back
Suck dick 'til they knee's get scratched
Then pull they head 'til they weave detach
