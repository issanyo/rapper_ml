A nigga livin' life like a G
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me

[Verse 1]
It's nothin' but, murder murder and mayhem
Kill you for them blood diamonds like we was in Cape Town, lay down (Brrrat!) Bricks upon the grey hound, send 'em straight to A-town

No mo' rocks, lil' nigga, I'm

We eatin', Dragon Gang

[Verse 2]
Army fatigues, artillery, that's how we get down

Gotta move them kicks now, niggas wanna rent now
The Regime mob is in effect so tuck the shit, pal
Lieutenant made the call, general called the shot
In Makaveli name, we do this shit for Pac
Thug immortal, outlaw like Fatal Hussein
You know the game, * your chain and take two to the brain

[Hook]
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep, I'm livin' in these wicked times, peep
Niggas after me 'cause they see I'm stackin' g's
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
Who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
And that artillery keepin' niggas off of me

[Verse 3]
Who me? livin' just like a G
I'm pushin' that

My hustle

Gotta get it-get it, *

I can't sleep, I'm tossin' and turnin'

[Verse 4]
Once upon a time, dog


Catch a nigga waitin' for me way before I came home

When I'm not 'round here

So good, eyeballin'

So dope with it, anybody talkin' 'bout

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I'm the
I'm the C in 'caine

I'm from the K

You the type to say shit, we the type to * *

[Verse 6]
Oh wee, a nigga livin' life like a G

Knock a nigga off his feet

Try to bury a nigga so deep so we won't

Put a hole in a nigga shirt

[Hook]
