Welcome
Little boys and girls. You thought niggas was gonna come weak?
Nigga this the Mobb fool, uh

I got some killers on the payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low

[Verse 1: Phats Bossalini]
I fight to struggle
Hoping God don't stop my hustle
My fam fight back like wild dogs wit out a muzzle
The shots was muffled
I remember blood puddles
Land of the scand' where niggas fallin in doubles
Maybe couples, I mean the strong kill the weak
Million dollar puzzles, I done placed the last piece
Success is sweet, I put it all back together
Mass melted cheddar strictly guarded by Berettas, uh
Cash sweet, for the jewels, they get they ass beat
Sweat in my sleep, think they found a way to blast me
Grossly, muthafuckaz tried to choke me
Sliced they throat, look in my eyes, die slowly
You owe me, that's for takin it, P
Now what's left to play solely that's for fuckin wit me
Listen, in the streets it's a respect thang
Can't tell the tune, let the nine, Tec sing
Mostly 'caine products got sold on my block
Most the nights I slept got awoke by shots
The inner city, I could care less about your pity
I'm Phats Bossin ready to die if you come get me

[Verse 2: Madd Maxx]
Well you can label me an outlaw, it's Madd Maxx turn to set it off
Grab the 9 millimeter by the pistol grip an let it off
Like Dustin Hoff', killin MC's off wit a vengance
Blow the microphone up and leave it smokin when I'm finished
Popeye on spinach, my niggas been in and done done it
So come to Smoke-a-Lot Records, nigga, you know who run it
I gets blunted 168 hours a week
P tried to creep and get burnt from head to feet
But never sleep on the vocabulary skills
Of a nigga that's out to make mills, uh
My nigga Phats Bossalini chills on the block with cash
Got a hundred hidden in the stash, fast to blast

[Verse 3: Numskull]
If it's one thang the nigga hate
It's niggas swangin like chimpanzees
That's why it's no exception
To the shit these niggas hand me
20 years of struggle
Huddles and plans can't amount to millions bubble
That's why we keep stacks tucked and cuddled
No matter my home, nigga, my home is where I'm hustlin
Wit Killaz On The Payroll, makin' up for lost pay loads
The Bay knows, it's hustle-matic til you drop
Stop, look and roll through the cuts lookin for cops
I kept on grinding for three years, too muthafuckin long
And had to cope wit everythang that went wrong
I got the Lord in my life, not 'cause religion
But the fact was a nigga had dreams and visions
Never listened to grown folks, I did my own thang
So muthafuckin what if it's the wrong thang
It's only one rule I live by:
Keep some Killaz On The Payroll, nigga, and get your shit right

[Hook: Phats Bossalini]
I got some killers on the payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low

[Verse 4: Poppa L.Q.]
Presentin more urban tales
Of crack sales and blackmail
And black males peelin black males
I swear these California streets is symbolic to Baghdad
It's sad
They did my comrade bad, smoked him wit the mag
Now he's walkin wit a cane, and wearin a shit bag
My loc keep me focused got me sporting this rag
With this tragedy added to agony and frustration
Farrakhan himself couldn't stop the retaliation
'Cause his only climax was payback
He let his wounds heal then got more get back
The lo-jack posted up at the gambling shack
Fully strapped wit a Benjamin big faced stack on the attack
Lookin for the assailant who put in the work
He swore on the turf he'd put his asshole in the dirt
'Cause a million soldiers died in this urban street war
Before the deaths of Biggie and 2Pac Shakur
Is this the effects of being young, black and poor?
Do we genetically have what it takes to endure?
Had killaz lookin for him from Crenshaw to Figueroa
To the O-A-K, 6-9 Ville keeps it real
'Cause men sharpen men like steel sharpen steel
We warriors for the scrill wit' a whole lot of will
And I'm never gonna put down my sword and chill
'Cause I'm out here in these fields with the focus of a drill

Yeah, straight Mobulation affiliation
With enough scrill to put down an assassination

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Verse 5: Yukmouth]
Uh, uh
Well it's that Ville nigga, that real nigga
That fill niggas wit hot ones
Combined wit L we doubled barreled guns
Motherfuckers best run
Fuckin around with album numb' two
So, do not be fuckin around wit we and we won't fuck around wit you
I do hang wit Dru, I do not be fuckin wit busta niggas like you
Can't trust niggas in your crew, what to do, I
Don't be drinkin no brew, I
Do get high til I kiss the sky and straight up I ingest in do
Why, do I
Go on the under like True Lies
Shakin these fleas and shoo-flys
Royalties from Noo-Trybe
Got niggas tryin to twist me like screwdrive'
But fuck what you claim
We aim Mac 10s
Hoobang and hooride
So who die?
Nobody ever knew
'Cause true
Killaz don't fuck wit niggas like you
Bumpin your gums bout who got ya threw in the flue
Drunk in the Chev', grabbin your pumpkin head like "Ooooh"
I been the Ice Cream Man since '92 comin through
In the ice cream truck on triple gold shoes, fuck some Trues
Vogues give the hoes blues, bitches choose and lose
Plus I puff indo, fool, how could you refuse?
I do not be fuckin wit broke bitches like you
Only if you knew my game would have you running trains through the crew
I do
But since I got funk wit Dangerous Crew
Some new niggas tryin to step on my shoe
You know who
That nigga got a perm like Dru
Burn like two
Remmies when he perform for you
I do
Kick it wit real niggas from Frisco
That's who?
My niggas from Get Low, the RBL, my nigga Coug
Nut, 11/5
Bump this in your Chev' and ride
Did a show in Reno, about seven died
Muthafuckaz startin to ride
But niggas ain't bumpin no 4-TAY
'Cause he too busy (bietch) tryin to smoke some more yay, uh
Hoes say around the Bay 'I knew
He be funny lookin like G-Money, nigga, puffin woos'
Heard you got married to a crack pipe
You need to get some Get Right like Mac Mall
'Cause you act like you can't rap at all
Cappin' jaws are swingin on platinum balls
Won't get flat on your wall
Just get snatched up in a U-Haul
'Cause you'se a bitch nigga like RuPaul
You all think you gonna make money dissin my crew?
But only if you knew, nigga
You fuckin wit these Mob niggas fool, uh

[Hook]

I got some killers on the payroll, and they know
And they know...
