[HOOK: Fed-X & Dru Down]
Ok It's, Murder!
Wid three holes in a beenie hat pulled down over my face
And I got some guns on my waist
It's, Murder!
I come wid a goon squad mob that'll hit and pop
Knock you off ya feet and outta ya socks
Ok It's, Murder!
Now tell me have you ever heard or seen
A nigga that get his back split and do some back flips
It's, Murder!
I come wid them two-two twenty-fives them thiry-two thirty eights
Forty-four forty-fives and then them nines

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
I'm a motherfuckin' mobsta, nigga I don't pop my collar
I'm in fatigues jumpin' outta trees like wild koalas
In a choppah, poppin' the pasta, movin' that rocka
Choppin' the block up in a topless Boxer boy
Heavy drama I'll machete ya momma
And when it's beef the K eat niggas like Jeffrey Dahmer
Hannibal Lector animal dismantle ya sector
After all hoe protectors pipes bust under pressure BITCH!
I'm on the block wid my CB scanner
If ya snitch ya get a one way trip to see D Banner
See me deep in Atlanta wid a sleazy bammer
Where Lil Flip and Banner still squeeze the hammer
When I air out the space it's hard to breathe like asthma
Head in the backseat DVDs and plasma
Man I ride spinners y'all ride on adapters
Man you know it's murder when I ride on a rapper

[HOOK]

[Verse 2: Fed-X]
Okay it's murder haven't you ever heard of the emperor
The beast the man in black is looking for the chief
If I'm a monster call NASA eat guns wid plasma
Tryna knock off the space dude turn me into space food
I pack a space guage that send you to the space age
Murder death kill a serial racker and steel
Black van no license plate
Homicide on a white man God writes the fate
I pause and hit the gate I'm the guy to let him die
The knife to his throat it's called Colombian neck tie
We hold him hostage no wheelchairs baby
The Don the kidnapper and I make ya family pay me

[HOOK]
