[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I know, do re mi
But no I'm not a R&B singer
I'm a gangster rapper throwing up the middle finger
To them square Rubik's Cubes, who don't smoke and use
I'm a cutthoat boy and I got a short fuse
I get kinda hyphy when I'm gone off a little gin
You don't like it? Say hello to my little friend
Rat-a-tat-tatta, it really don't matter
I push a hard line, cross it, niggas gon' scatter
I'm not the mad rapper, I'm the rapper gone bad
Recording on Pro Tools at the pad
I get a gang of bab; boy, I'm a sav
Come through the sideshow yolkin' a cab

[Hook: Mac Dre]
Fuck what it cost (what it cost)
I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Tycoon (Ty-tycoon)
Dipped in sauce (in sauce)
I floss (I floss)
I-coon (I-I-coon)
Fuck what it cost (what it cost)
I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Tycoon (Ty-tycoon)
Dipped in sauce (in sauce)
I floss (I floss)
I-coon (I-I-coon)

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
What you know about a 600 V12 CL's
Spinnin' on them Sprewells
Dirty as hell like 'Fuck a detail!'
Still knock yo' female
Mack that bitch til' she break her Lee nails
On the track in the TL, Yukmouth
First week out, 80 thousand on the street sales
Now I'm CEO, that's seven dollars on the retail, bitch
I got niggas poppin' they collars, poppin' E pills
Poppin' them bottles then poppin' them cowards with that heatelle
And fuck Spitz, I get my ice from Vionnis
My New York Italianni, he plug me with Spanish mamis
Bitches belly dancin' like a swami, but fuck 'em
I'm too cocky, poppin' that Dom P., smokin' my broccoli
'Cause I'm a million dollar man like Ted DiBiase
The Feds see me, watch me, baby Liberace
The wrist stay rocky, the whips stay saucy, rims glossy
With mackin' ass Dre beside me, call me frosty Frosty the Snowman, the Oakland dopeman
Sell more kicks than Copeland's, bitch
The Oakland mayor, the Oakland Raider
With the king of Vallejo, bitch, foldin' paper
We tycoons, nigga

[Hook: Mac Dre]
Fuck what it cost (what it cost)
I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Tycoon (Ty-tycoon)
Dipped in sauce (in sauce)
I floss (I floss)
I-coon (I-I-coon)
Fuck what it cost (what it cost)
I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Tycoon (Ty-tycoon)
Dipped in sauce (in sauce)
I floss (I floss)
I-coon (I-I-coon)

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
I ride around town in my clean ass Benz
Range Rove, Cougnut on some clean ass rims
Felt like Ted Turner, I pack a lead burner
Spit it, to get it, can't quit it, I'm a bread earner (ch-ching)
Boss up at the 5-star telly
Dre touch mo' bread than the motherfucking deli
Young rich nigga, 20-inch nigga
P-I-M-P, it's all on a bitch, nigga
I've been getting scrill, diamonds in my grill
Rep the pill, and boy do I keep it trill
Show-off, that'll go off on a blade
Kill like Raid and stay gone off naid
Do what the fuck I wanna, got bitches on the corner
Not just a thizz user, I'm a Thizz owner
Sometimes I thizz, sometimes I shroom
But whatever I do, I'mma stay a tycoon

[Hook: Mac Dre]
Fuck what it cost (what it cost)
I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Tycoon (Ty-tycoon)
Dipped in sauce (in sauce)
I floss (I floss)
I-coon (I-I-coon)
Fuck what it cost (what it cost)
I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Tycoon (Ty-tycoon)
Dipped in sauce (in sauce)
I floss (I floss)
I-coon (I-I-coon)
