[Verse 1]
Waking up another California morning, sun shining through my window
Another day of being broke, but I survived another 24, so;
"Thank the Lord", that's what momma say
Momma stressing over them bills, gotta be payed
The food getting low, eating noodles and cereal
But the first of the month is like two days away, so;
"Thank the Lord", them checks coming
Some shots rained out and everybody is running
The enemy came through looking to hurt something, but who?
Never knew the hollow tips would touch nothing, I;
"Thank the Lord", nobody was hit
No cops patrolling the hood for gangs injunction
It's all good, we can hang out
So bring a grill and a radio out, it's a celebration, no doubt we;
"Thank the Lord", for our freedom

[Hook]
It's so hard, so hard to get by
Momma always say the strong will survive
So I'm gon' get praised for everything I got
"Thank the Lord"
Because I know one day, one day that I
Will make it, better wait, they say in due time
So I'm gon' keep my head touching the sky
"Thank the Lord"

[Verse 2]
Project house party, no altercations, what a surprise
Homies was shootin' dice outside
But everybody was sober, therefore meaning nobody was robbed, so;
"Thank the Lord", nothing popped off
Lil' mama quick to take her top off
She too young to be having sex, only being in ninth grade
She listened to Pac seen the mistakes that Brenda made, so;
"Thank the Lord", she was inspired
I hate having to see that lil' boy watching us smoke up something to that loud, now that's nothing I enjoy
But the deep game slowed up meaning nobody's employed, so;
"Thank the Lord", the fools had nothing to hit
Nobody hoppin' that fence, nobody thinking 'bout tryna commit
We just tryna remember the Watts Riots
Knowing I survived that, I can't help but just;
"Thank the Lord", I'm still here

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got my priorities right, no more hanging out late nights ducking the force
I know you see my name in the limelight, so of course I;
"Thank the Lord", I got a career
Momma was disappointed throughout the years, but now she's proud
I love to see my success make her smile
I love to see them Jay Rock shirts i-in the crowd, I;
"Thank the Lord", for my fans
I sit back for a minute and put it in GOD's hands
He said he'll have it mapped out tomorrow
I said "that's a little too quick", but that's when I met dude, dawg I;
"Thank the Lord", for him believing in me
Went from that project boy on the block to winning awards
Multi-million record sales, worldwide tours
I never regret being poor, the more I think about it I;
"Thank the Lord", for the growth of Jay Rock
