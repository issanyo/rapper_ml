[Intro: Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, DJ talking]
(Work out for me, work out for me)
(Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse One: Kendrick Lamar]
Feeling like a mother fucking animal
Hannibal Lecter of 2012
Elected to execute every rapper that has excelled
If music is your calling
You're falling, pick up yourself
If a nigga said he could see me
Bet he told you in Braille, fucker
Put you in front of the street then buy you some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, should've worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldn't bare my triumph
I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swinging swords like I'm sparring with a Spartan
Watch they face drop when the beat drop
I drop a real jewel like a Martin, fool
Me and curtains ballin' like peewee kirkland callin' 'em kirk franklin
Stomp 'em, leave 'em hurting
No judgement for a plaintiff
They tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as O.D.B
But I've been O.D. since '03
That's March 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it like sweet chin
Music on Chuck Norris

[DJ Talking]

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Look, look, look
I'm J-A-Y, Rock to be exact
Niggas said gardens, Watts on the map
Hm, story of this eastside nigga
All my life in the ghetto on the peace side nigga
Where across the tracks, opposites attract
Niggas go hard for the color of they flag
Dope man money, welfare recipients
Unfit mothers never heard of obedience
Ho's so devious, niggas all talk
Right around the corner, deja vu
Same old shit, something like re-runs
Gotta stay sharp, if you slip then you bleed ?
Guns in the Levis, 501s
Niggas don't box, they buy more guns
Uh, that's how it is on these L.A. streets
Don't sleep, don't sleep
Look, catch me sitting in my truck
Remy in this cup
No tags on this bitch, but I don't give a fuck
I ride until the wheels fall off
That's some real shit
Never let them get in your mind, never reveal shit
Let a nigga know your feelings, business and all
He's the type of nigga riffing and wishing on you to fall
Fake niggas try and impersonate your character
That's why I got my mother's fucking eyes on them scavengers
Watch 'em!
My daddy told me that every day
Pray for late Charles, why he have to pass away?
Thinking about my pops, then the stress starts to kick in
Roll me up a fat ass blunt and start drinking
Damn!
Then reality starts to set in
I'm married to the streets and I ain't never had a wedding
I stop selling dope because niggas started telling
Sex, money, and weed: the life we start living
Guns in the closet for niggas who start tripping
Stay in the house when them choppers come out spitting
Stay on your job
Keep your eyes open on every corner
The blink of an eye, and you're a goner
No wronger, tell 'em about the pains of this hunger
Shock 'em like thunder
And the ? going bonkers
Just living my life up on some cool shit
So, nigga just miss me with all that bull shit
