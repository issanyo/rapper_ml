[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Money over bitches why you bullshiting nigga
Listen pull up in something with the roof missing
You dissing four-five that'll leave your roof missing
Who tripping true spitting cadillac coupe dipping
Crew whippin wit yo bitch present this is new pimpin
Roll up get a cup only Hennessy sippin
West Coast jumpin like a low-low
Three-wheelin we feelin
Like the New Dynasty dominating the Nation

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Pamona pimpin when im sippin that hard liquor
Hit the studio with mo cuts than a cold sensor
Nigga what, im a west coast predator
Pteradactyl when i sink my teeth in the beat
Got a lock like Armostol? shakles around her feet
Glock in my right palm got my strong arm steady like kwali
Make it hard for you to get by the silencer is so serene
Sound like a california ocean breeze, no lie

[Verse 3: Jay Rock & *Kendrick Lamar*]
So high really though put hoes on video
Run trains like blue lines on Subways
While you save em like coupons we throw away
Extra large Magnum wrappers
*We them nasty rappers*
We them Magnum blasters
*Say hello to the pastor*
Coughin' up a loogie when I'm walking past your casket
See I don't give a shit about my enemies
Feel the same way about a bitch

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Speaking of a bitch these hoes is no joke
Tell a story any chance they get
Where my money at? She talking bout she broke
Now I can dig in her left pocket
Dig in her right pocket, dig in her back pocket
Pull money out of all three and still swear up and down that she don't got it
Bitch, you must think I'm [?] the fool
You better hop up on the track and put that pussy to use
Now, I oughta go upside your motherfucking wig
But you lucky your little boy called the police on me the last time I hit you
In front of yo' kid
