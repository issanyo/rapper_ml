[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Break bread with my niggas
Now I’m sippin’ with the figgas
Bought some new weapons even sicker with the triggers
But let me paint a picture, picture me richer, haters can’t see it cause they blind to the vision
I ain’t lying when I’m spitting the bullet is what I’m givin’
Blessed with this flow its the gift I was given
Nigga Im the shit when I’m rhyming I’m shitting on the top of your head
Like a bird on top a building bitch
Like a sucide bomb I’m determined to blow
Gotta get that money we allergic to broke
Me and thug we do it for the west coast
East side Watts side south central

[Hook: Kendrick]
Go on put them things in the trunk homie (Ride Out)
Don’t forgot the mac and pump on me (Ride Out)
We give it to you it you want homie (Ride Out)
8 week, 8 week, (Ride Out)
Jay Jay, Rock Rock, K-K Dot Dot hoe (hold up hold up)
Pump your breaks right now before it be too late, bow down

[Verse 2: Youg Dubb]
Young Dubb I got it
Young rock I got it
The boys a problem with equal sign
Sean carter, the son of pac so Makaveli my father, oh
I forgot to advise Y’all, oh, I forgot to surpass y’all
Hold out, it gets deep, every since the Maybachs came out
Its been more room for the K’s in the back seat
Now we riding out in luxury, black Armani suits
Duping out a translucent roof, presidential organized crime
Like an army have a crew, little niggas put em on the front line
Let em shoot til they wrist hurt, arms hurt, shoulder hurt, arm near, shoulder there
Coroner you search it you double dare me to die I write you first

[Hook: Kendrick]
Go on put them things in the trunk homie (Ride Out)
Don’t forgot the mac and pump on me (Ride Out)
We give it to you it you want homie (Ride Out)
8 week, 8 week, (Ride Out)
Jay Jay, Rock Rock, K-K Dot Dot hoe (hold up hold up)
Pump your breaks right now before it be too late, bow down

[Verse 3: Young Dubb]
Back to the basics, cake I bake it
Any nigga fuck with my money I go Ape shit
I’m something you never seen like a spaceship
I’m on some different world shit face it
Cause everytime i drop a rhyme you need a facelift
Cause niggas jaws drop whenever I say shit
On the block with rocks and AK clips
No job but I stay on
So I’ stay this, if you see me rollin, you’ll see more niggas than the slave ship
With whips and chains around em’ bricks and caine around em
I’m switch the game around e me and jay rock k dot get it popping
Got eyes on the block yo the streets watching
Got a teacher flow yo I school niggas
Got a U haul guns dawg, it move niggas
Its either me or you you gotta move niggas
I gotta lotta K’s, so the outcome of fuckin’ with me is like taxes, you gotta pay

[Hook: Kendrick]
Go on put them things in the trunk homie (Ride Out)
