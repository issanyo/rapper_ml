Yeah the night is still young and I ain't gettin' no older
So hit your boy up after the club is over

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Punch]
Yeah, we done did it again
Me and Rock 'bout to get those in, so where you at Bo
Hot lines the nicest, got the flow locked down
Like I put it in vice grips
You don't know another spitter that's like this
Call me hot lines, cause I got hot lines, like a psychic
The flow spittin, more better than most
Make it clap for cheddar, like first kings of the coast
If you got it then drop it
Let's see how quick you can break these pockets
The walk is sick, the talk is slick
Don't look her in the eye, she'll talk you out of your chips
Glossy lips, manicured French tip
She addicted to Punch, cause the flow make sense
It make sense, yeah I get that later
Bounce with me one time if you gettin' that paper

[Outro]
It's goin' down tonight, be cool
You don't wanna pay that price
Grab a girl get a drink and it's all good
Blue rags red flags, yeah it's all hood
