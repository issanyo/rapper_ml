[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I told my niggas, "If you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back"
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact

I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs

I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Uh, imagine Rock up in that field where options ain't so audible
Problems steady fallin', the effects is like some dominoes
Issues chronological, gotta get that money fast
Andale, vamonos, feelin' like Osama, got my llama close
Hope them boys don't come knock at my mama's door
AK-47 out that window, think I'm paranoid
America, another case I can't afford, help me Lord

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I told my niggas, "If you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back"
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact

I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs

I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Been about that money, fuck the damn lotto
Cruisin' through the 'jects wit' the 12 shotta
Most my niggas gone or the jail got em'
And most these bitches wrong but we still jock em'
Cocaine in the trap, still rockin'
Them hood rats in the back got that trim poppin'
She twerkin' for the camera while her kids watchin'
And she gon' take that cheese to go wig shoppin'
That's if she owe me that, go check my zodiac
Have many coke and cognac in that cul-de-sac
My uncle Bobby had them bodies, he wore the mac
Ain't talking oldies when its singin' that 40 clap
Can't nobody hold me back, I'mma locomotive steam rollin'
Gotta fight to keep that money stream open
Liquor shots is for your team, that's tree smokin'
In that coupe de ville with D's on it

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I told my niggas, "If you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back"
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact

I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs

I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Gotta get it ain't no options out here
Her nigga just killed my partner out here
They wonder why we steady glockin' out here
Cuz niggas they ain't really lockin' out here
And we ain't worried 'bout them coppers out here
Do anything to try to stop us out here
No 9-to-5's but we clockin' out here
Every chance they get you know they watch us out here
Oh yeah, got to be that animal
Streets is like a jungle, it'll eat you like it's Hannibal
Wigs splitted, cantaloupe, yeah we see that everyday
Candles lit, pour out liquor, hope it take the pain away
I ain't tryna pay my way, I'm just tryna pave my way
Mama tell me gotta save them pennies for them rainy days
Have me snatch that switch, off that branch with some leaves on it
Fantasizin' bout some money trees on em'

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I told my niggas, "If you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back"
We gon' catch these Gs, now watch me do just that
Make these monies easy and watched 'em grew in fact

I told my niggas if you hold me back
From pursuin', ain't no comin' back
Pick your poison, tell me what you do with that
Make these monies easy and watch 'em grew in packs

I told my niggas if you hold me back

[Outro: Jay Rock]
Yeah, on this journey we call life, its always gonna be obstacles, road blocks, things tryna hold you back. Just keep pushin, don't let that stop you. Never give up, stay chasin' money trees. Don't let nobody tell you you can't do it. Keep going, nahmean?
Don't let nobody stop you, I mean nobody. Uh huh, go hard for what you believe in
Stay up, wake up, cake up, get paper, and I swear to God things will fall in your favor
