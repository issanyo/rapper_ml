[Intro]
Father forgive them
For they know not what they do
They know not what they say
And they know not what they see

[Verse 1: BJ the Chicago Kid]
All I wanted was a little fun
But you gave me more than I wanted
Wasn't really trying to even be the one
But I staged it like it was coming

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my god
You got me saying oh my god

[Verse 2: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Bullshit ain't nothing but chewed up grass
Cross me once nigga, no more passage
I'mma still be here when all said and done
And like I told you before
I ain't tryna be the one, you see
When the truth staring you right in your face
Tell me what you gonna do
Some people get addicted after the first taste
Cause misery loves a fool

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my god
Oh my god
You got me saying oh my god

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
The stress and the anger I can't manage
Somewhere between these other 8 planets I stay stranded
With all my wounds stitched up, wrapped in this ace bandage
I make them pass out on the line, like Hank Gathers
Cause cake matters, soda mixed in this cake batter
Now papa got a brand new bag with the same swagger
I Mick Jagger when I rock out with the same dagger
She said it like a Green Bay Packer, the aim splattered
I ball out for 40 highlights on the game tracker
Same chapter with this wannabe posers and lame rappers
Now I'm the one they came after, this is my battle with the Devil's child
Trying to make sure that we never smile
We never smile when coke fiends got they own dreams
Gotta get the garbage from 'round me, I'm tryna go green
Niggas in late feelings, the antidote is morphine
Real niggas only, I hope you make it to quarantine

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Oh my god
