[Intro]

[Verse: Jay Rock]
It's Jay Rock, born in the heart of [?] this spittin'
And my bars hit harder than car collisions
My hands still hurt from all that pitchin
I'm still bitching for your dough, like Robin Givens
The Lebron of ours, so I was built for balling
You lazy ass niggas y'all was built for stalling
I'm still standing tall you can't knock me down
I ain't got a lot of weight but I'm packing pounds, get it?
(My name's Jay Rock I'm the man in the streets
If you need that work come holla at me)
Give me some green and give me some white
It's hard times so a nigga might double the price
I'm starving, got damn pockets to feed
On the mic spitting flows 800 degrees
I'm a hustler, nigga, yes I love the grind
Call me Busta, nigga, yes I love to rhyme
Yeah my hand never shaking when I'm holding a nine
Clutch game crazy, like Bird in his prime, nigga
(In these streets gotta carry your clips
If not your a dead ass son of a bitch)
I'm holding more K's than the Ku Klux Klan
You want a head up, you don't wanna see my hands, nigga
Got a jab like Judah that's no lie
Let four fly, all black blowflies
I'm from the projects don't get it twisted
Talking sideways you gon come up missing
Laid back in the truck, rolling up a Swisher
Dot in the back, tea bagged me a sister
(Yeah I'm from Watts and I rep the bricks
If you run your lip, we gon bust your shit)
You could catch Jay Rock on some gangsta shit
On the block with a chain and a [?]  to spit
In the hood with some good [?] pound of twigs
Rifles, plenty rounds got box of clips
I'm a project nigga I'll box ya [?]
I'm like pills in the club, I'll pop ya quick
Yeah that rhyme so sick I spit toxic shit
Yeah that flow so golden like a bottle of piss
(It's T-O-P D-A-W-G
It's the new West Coast and we run these streets)
There's no more drive-bys niggas do walk-ups
Spark stuff, leavin' bodies all chopped up
I got nines and a couple of Macs
That'll split a couple of heads and push shit back
I'm from the land where they push that crack
On Compton Ave., all the hoes yeah they sell that ash
You got money go and show your stash
But don't show your ass
Cause these killers they'll show no blast, nigga
