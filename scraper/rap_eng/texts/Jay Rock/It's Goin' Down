[Intro]
Hey yo Dot, they wanna hear Yung Joc
But they got young Rock on this mothafucka
Ab-Soul in this mothafucka, Sounwave in this mothafucka
Come on Top Dawg E-N-T

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
It's like damn, they see me every day
All in my face like, Rock where you stayin'
Nickerson Gardens where they cook raw
Whippin' that work 'till that bitch turn hard
Druggin' to the bone, Chucks on my feet
[?] can you drink like me
Chocolate Impala, with vanilla seats
Three wheel motion every time we hit the streets
Catch me in the hood, movin' down a four
Got a [?] right up on the [?]
If your bitch choose us let her do her thing
Cause when I'm done with her I'ma pass her to my manes
Everybody know me, I'm so fly
Throwin' up the beat, every time I ride by
Goin' for the win, we ain't tryin' to lose
Top Dawg E-N-T make you do what it do

[Hook]
If you talkin' shit, you goin' down
When I see a bad bitch, I gotta take her down
Nigga when there's beef, I grab the four pound
Better stay strapped, if not you goin' down
Yeah I tell 'em [?], it's goin' down
Money on my mind, it's goin' down
Still pop nines, by the rounds
Tryin' to win it all, Rock goin' for the crown

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Verse number two, ain't nothin' changed
Move around town in white tee, black jeans
Snatch a bad broad, gotta break her off
I ain't gotta choice but to beat down them walls
Catch me on the chirp, tryin' to get some work
Feds on the line, they can't decipher the words
Guns I be packin', seven days a week
Keep the heat ready just in case we in beef
Niggas don't like me I already know
I got a lot of clothes, lot of hoes, lot of dough
Niggas know my crew, top Dawg ballers
I'm still in the hood but we living like stars
Ridin' Dodge Magnums, Cadillac Coupes
Stocks in your trunk dog, you ridin' on boots
If you got a problem, thing on my waist
If you say somethin' I'ma put it in your face

[Hook]
