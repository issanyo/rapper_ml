Received a telegram goin' crazy
I tell the 'Gram I'm goin' crazy
Cause even in reality
Complaining shit don't bother me
Received a telegram goin' crazy
I tell the 'Gram I'm goin' crazy
Aye baby now you want the truth
Well I'mma yell it from the roof

[Break: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Question after question after fuckin' question
Girl you my pride and blessing
Aye girl ain't no second guessin'
I'm 'bout the sweetest chemistry
And question after question after fuckin' question
If ain't no right then ain't no wrong
And girl I feel Iâ€™m where I belong
I'm 'bout the sweetest chemistry

Received a telegram goin' crazy

Complaining shit don't bother me

Well I'mma yell it from the roof

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I rap to try to better our situation
Wanna scroll through my text message for vindication
You Judge Judy, I'm comin' home to litigations
Stimulate your lil' ego and I got you patient
Look I ain't tryna go back to the basic
You dealin' with bitches who basic with double faces
Smile in your face and leave our business in different places
But I'm crazy
Cause I'm out late nights politickin', I gotta get it, baby
Stay off that social media, it's the devil, I'm tellin' ya
Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, it'll tell on ya
Keep your feelings inside, tell me what's on your mind
Don't show your hands for the world, have me out in the blinds, girl
I ain't out here doin' it for the Vine, girl
We all fall in temptation, just know you're my girl
And even though that sound crazy, at least I'm tryin', girl
But your reply:

Stayin' faithful's a process
Girl you steady dealin' with my mess
Steady put up with my shit
In the club with bombshells
She throwin' that coochie at me, I'm tryna control my fear
Don't wanna lose my dear
Cause I put in too much time there
Often I get distracted by bad bitches in my ear
Now you got niggas all up in your ears
Tryin' to overthrow here
Now here come the questions
Questions after mothafuckin' questions
Seems like arguin' is your preference
I admit it, sometimes I can be selfish
Like you better not give my pussy away
Is that goin' against the rules of the game that we play?
Look I don't know, should I keep it player or keep it pushin'?
Hard to decide when the one that you love steady woofin'
Ain't that a bitch?
3 in the mornin', I'm on and tryna make these hits
My phone bleepin' and all I see is

Yeah girl I feel the way I've blown
I'm 'bout to speed this chemistry
