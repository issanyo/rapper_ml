[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Now I done seen a lot of things
Know the trouble the money and fame brings
This time I swear it’s different
I’m in the right place
I know I’m in the right place

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Some niggas hated on me
Some bitches never looked my way
Now that I made it, homie
There’s some things that’ll never be the same
Some things will never be the same
Shouldn't have let me get no money
Some things will never be the same
Now things will never be the same
Shit, I been had bitches
And they don’t never look the same
What the fuck these niggas sayin'?
Some things will never be the same
What the fuck these niggas sayin'?
Some things will never be the same, yeah

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Progress is the concept, so let me flex
My old hoes 'bout that nonsense, I just let 'em text
Even one-night stands get forever set
So do they home girls, sisters and whoever next
I’m sorry, the world may change
But some things stay the same, they stay classic like Atari
Fuck them bitch niggas that was actin bitch nigga
See me with my side ho and told my main bitch, nigga
You’s a bitch nigga and now we in the club
Go and fuck it up and you a huge fan
Tryna introduce yo fam, takin' flicks for Instagram
You more sketchier than drawings
Can’t be round' these niggas ballin'
Like liquor and alcoholics, weed and look whatcu-mah call it
Hey there, I wouldn’t made it thinkin' bout you
Now I’ll never think about you
Have nothing to think about

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Now I done seen a lot of things
Know the trouble the money and fame brings
This time I swear it’s different
I’m in the right place
I know I’m in the right place

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Some niggas hated on me
Some bitches never looked my way
Now that I made it, homie
There’s some things that’ll never be the same
Some things will never be the same
Shouldn't have let me get no money
Some things will never be the same
Now things will never be the same
Shit, I been had bitches
And they don’t never look the same
What the fuck these niggas sayin'?
Some things will never be the same
What the fuck these niggas sayin'?
Some things will never be the same, yeah

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Look at the man in the mirror
It gets tougher to watch when it’s yourself you've got a fear of
Plus you surrounded by niggas hating
You see it all in they eyes, it makes you wanna fuck some shit up
Tryna' make it up out the ghetto
The block is like the Olympics, we walk around with our metals
On the grind for the cheddar, so fuck them hoes, let 'em chat
The objective is to be honest, get dollars and let it stack
That’s what it is, ho, things will never be the same
This is my year, ho, so tell them fuckboys make way
If they hate, then let 'em hate, I’m just happy that I made it
Got that yola, got 'em rockin' when Jay rockin' on them stages
I guess I’m in the right place, I guess I’m in the right place
Roll it up, let's fade away...
