[Intro]
Yeah, you know what it is
If you niggas don't know, better act like you know
Ha ha, we run this shit, yeah

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Nigga, nigga, nigga
This T-O-P D-A-double-gizee E-N-T
Bitch-niggas want to envy
Black semi, black beanie, don't play hero
Feel froggy and leap, get with a black (?)
The big bad J, I'm the talk of the town
Disrespect this here, then they barkin' you down
Then they chalkin' you out, wrappin' you up
Walkin' you out to grave where they puttin' your ass down
Hands down, I'm the most anticipated emcee
Lyrical rhyme-slayer, that's me
When I speak, your favorite rapper, he get nervous
Hit the booth and bring the word like Sunday service
Catch me on my late night in the in the back lurkin'
Pistol on the front seat, watchin' for them serpents
West Coast for life, and Gz to the heart
Watts, Cali, my city, I ain't takin' a loss

Hook
This Top Dawg, we run this shit
Makin' that money, stackin' them chips
Takin' over the game, makin' these hits
Top Dawg E-N-T, we run this shit
Top Dawg, we run this shit
Talkin' that shit, we bustin' them clips
Better pay homage, who you fuckin' with?
This Top Dawg, boy, we takin' over shit

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I'm in the best position, I'm what the West was missin'
The forty ounce by the shore with the message in it, get it?
The message in it, writ in the Range, then performed by
The black-lipped bastard with the four eyes
Worked a fortune, four pies
Forklifted in the sky, reconfigured and delivered by I
My attitude is smooth, but my altitude is high
I thank God I never had to do time
Confined to the grime like a Pusha T
But you can see the malice every time the clips spit at you
This is rapture from a Jurassic Park raptor
And you look like a Jurassic Park actor
Bark at you, one hit to the lip, jaw fractured
This is it, fall backwards
Nah, that would mean that you stood for somethin'
Crawl backwards to your habitat
Top Dawg, you niggas is pussy as a alley cat

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bo]
Yeah, they say, "More money, more problems"
Well, since a nigga had more money, no problems
Revolver will solve him and back him off my dick
No homo, you can catch me on the black bitch
It (?), bitch, still no homo
Feds takin' glamor shots, no photos
My goons in that four-door with the rocket though, yo
Ready to cock back and let it blow
Bo got a cocky flow, Rock and Dot, yeah, we got it, bro
Let me keep it real though, Bo got a (?)
Tell 'em (?), tell these bitches what that pussy hittin' fo'
I info, these niggas takin' the wrong bill though
They takin' (?) and that deal though
Boy, I'm off that Indo smoke and I'm a real boss
So when they walk through that door, bitch, grab my coat
Indo make me choke, y'all niggas fuckin' with whom?
It's Top Dawg and the nigga comin' soon

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, vigilante K. Dot, feelin' antsy when I jump in the booth
Top Dawg, lick two shots
Cameras off, this is pay-per-view, City of Compton-bound
Your fraternity die instantly on my stompin' grounds
Code of the streets, eye for an eye
And only thing could come between that is a unibrow
You are now tuned into hieroglyphics, chips like Macintosh
Clips like a movie script
Back off or I put tips on you like you strip
Then make you strip like a chop shop, do your call
This is real as it gets
Y'all will never exist once I journalist the current events
Furnace, return and burn on your strip
Burn a homie, got an umbilical cord to my hip
Glock 40, double clip, plus a six-shooter
Catch forty, bitch, black Berry Gordy
Flip, shorty, pass him to the homies
Half 'em lookin' for me, gave her good dick

[Hook]
