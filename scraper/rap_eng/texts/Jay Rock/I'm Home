Everybody's still singing my song
Saying that the game has been on pause
Since you left, you left, so let me press play
I'ma get the beats back rocking
And beds back knocking
You know who I be, who I be
Ladies, the wait is over here I am
Swags on the million
Get your cameras ready
Ain't nobody else do what I do
I've been working but I gotta prove
Everywhere I go they're screaming out my name
I'm on my way

They say you be gone for a minute
Ain't nobody else did it like you did it
Well tell 'em I'm home
Tell 'em I'm home
Been back like I never left
If anybody asks 'bout me
Tell 'em that I'm right where I'm supposed to be
Tell 'em I'm home
Tell 'em I'm home
Been back like I never left

I'm home
I'm home
And I'm not going nowhere this time

Grab a couple of bottles and meet me on the stage
Everything is on me, we gonna celebrate
Ain't no place like this in the world
Been MIA so it was time to return
You can love it, hate it
But I'm staying
Ain't going no where, no where
I'm a going, going around you

Ain't nobody else do what I do
I've been working but I gotta prove
Everywhere I go they're screaming out my name
I'm on my way

They say you be gone for a minute
Ain't nobody else did it like you did it
Well tell 'em I'm home
Tell 'em I'm home
Been back like I never left
If anybody asks 'bout me
Tell 'em that I'm right where I'm supposed to be
Tell 'em I'm home
Tell 'em I'm home
Been back like I never left

First things first, I'm home, take your camera out
Jay rock, Tyrese why city jugging us?
Got no other choice to do a big monument
Pop bottles, with top models
Yeah we doing it
Haters can't ruin it
As said the well zone
Dropped my first album, power moves from the cell phone
Show here, show there
For show I got my money out
World wide groupie love, they always keep that ass up
Ty bet put the hood on the map, yeah
All this music shit, the whole hood got your back, black
Now we on the track
Together we gonna bubble
Worldwide soundtrack for the streets, they're gonna love it

They say you be gone for a minute
Ain't nobody else did it like you did it
Well tell 'em I'm home
Tell 'em I'm home
Been back like I never left
If anybody asks 'bout me
Tell 'em that I'm right where I'm supposed to be
Tell 'em I'm home
Tell 'em I'm home
Been back like I never left

I just wanna say thank you to all my fans
Who kept my music alive
You never gave your heart away to anybody else
I just appreciate you
I'm here to stay
I'm home
