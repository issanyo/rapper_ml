[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
How cool is gang banging?
Its love when you and your homies hanging huh
Your uncles had did it so its a chain reaction
Relate to your homies because them too are bastards
Feel that your hood color look good in Jordans
Spiking your name on the wall to feel important
Banging on niggas hope they push in line
Say the wrong street corner its go time
But ignorance is bliss because that fist is soon to turn into a bullet if that index finger pull it
Cameras comin for the footage
Channel 9 channel 11 aiming 9s mac 11's
Another baby for the reverend another casket
Taking action in a matter of a second
Nothings matters when your repping for your turf
Hold it down, have heart
Put in work
That's the moral of the story, when you worried and you wicked
And your mental never get it, its a sickness when you kill your own kind

[Hook: J. Black]
Different names, different sides, but I can see it in your eyes, that you're just like me (that I'm) just like you (you're) just like me (and I'm) just like you
Its up to you to decide how you're gonna change your life, you're just like me (and I'm) just like you (you're) just like me (I'm) just like you

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
How cool is selling drugs?
Its love when you and yours making bucks huh?
Your uncles was hustling so its a chain reaction
Risking somebody house just to get it crackin
Now everybody see you as a d boy
You shinin bright now its hard to be a decoy
Servin the junkies to get some quick cash
To give to your momma because she doin bad
Now bitches on your dick and niggas got they hands out like you owe them something if you dont look out of nothing then them Narco feds is coming you ain't even really thiknkin cause your mind is on the money
Jealous niggas politicin', on a plot to leave you bloody
But you blinded cause you shinin Fein want another hit
So you serve him 30 mintues and he OD'd off the shit
Thats the moral of the story when your greedy and you wicked, but your mind will never get it, its a sickness when you kill your own kind

[Hook: J. Black]
Different names, different sides, but I can see it in your eyes, that you're just like me (that I'm) just like you (you're) just like me (and I'm) just like you

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
You'd rather throw your life away?
On this gang banging shootin off your brother's face
Or perhaps living in the fast lane
Selling drugs poisoning people brains
Its just a thought but don't stress it man
Just know somebody momma out there suffering
Because she lost her baby to a stray bullet
Fell victim from all these these gang shooting .. mm mmm
Man these niggas out here wilen'
All the hooting and the hollin man you'd rather sell some powder instead trying in college
Where is all the father figures either dead or locked in bondage
Your tomorrow is never promised
My nigga, I'm being honest
Better wake up fast, last of dying breed
All I do is press facts jack
Look the moral of the story is certain hearts will never feel it
Plus they mind is really twisted
It's a sickness when I kill my own kind
