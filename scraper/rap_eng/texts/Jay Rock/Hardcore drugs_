Big sucks, hardcore drugs
Everything crooked what you thought this was

All that back and forth gets me high sometimes
Wanna see somebody get knocked out, just box one time, shit
Catch a fade, catch a fade, it ain't nothing
Get your head up at the gym, bring your knuckles
Look I'm deep inside them projects where's bracking at, you know the ZIP
Where we take a quarter piece, flip it til that...
