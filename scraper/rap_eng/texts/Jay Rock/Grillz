[Intro]

[Verse 1: Jay Rock and (Lea)]
24 inch rims, sittin' on in the drop
Catch his ass at a light, with a four-five cocked
Got a look at his chain, damn it look at his watch
That's sixty g's a piece, you could go re-cop
Nigga give me your jewels, and nigga hand me the rock
If you don't co-operate I'll leave your brains on this block
Woah man, this a nice piece, Oh, so icy
Oh, wrong move, face on the white tee
Gimme your keys and nigga hand me your wallet
Nigga empty your pockets before I cock it and pop it
Tell 'em honey
(he didn't know we was creepin')
(The icy jewels yeah we need them)
Look at his teeth, he got ice in his grill
We can pawn that shit and come up with some skrill
When you see this steel that means hand me your bills
And if you throw up a fight, you'll get popped like pills
Nigga

[Hook: Lea and (Jay Rock)]
He flossin' for you daddy (What you talkin' bout?)
Homie with the grill (Homie with the what?)
Yep, the grill, here goes the steel
(I'ma rob his ass blind tell him give me them bills)
He flossin' for you daddy (What you talkin' bout?)
Homie with the grill (Homie with the what?)
Yep, the grill, here goes the steel
(I'ma rob his ass blind tell him give me them bills)


[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What it do homie?, it's your young boy god given
Your unnecessary spending show how you're living
Them diamonds in your grill won't you take 'em out
'Fore I pistol whip your jaw and spank 'em out your mouth
I'll show 'em what a real hijack's about
Take everything scrape the change from under the couch
Platinum to rose gold, it's gettin' sold
Whatever's left the dentist figure it out
Put the hog to 'em or trick em out
Watch me barge through 'em like rottweilers and pitbulls
We ain't ate yet, and you lookin' fools
17 shots in the clip got the chamber full
Bang, yeah, you're looking kinda right
Now it's time to say goodnight, so glad that you came
Bang, one more just because you made my trigger finger sore
Now, give me diamond rings

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Bash and (Punch)]
It's Bash, click clack put the heat to his grill
Open wide, that's ice nigga bite the steel
(We supposed to be brothers)
Pussy nigga what you trying to kick knowledge
Smack 'em with the burner, empty your pockets
(What it do? It's young hot
From the bottom, out of Watts
Where they settin' up shop they ain't talkin' to the cops
If you want it then they got it
Niggas hungry and they plottin'
Come through keep it pushin' cause the streets is watchin')
Yeah, you know what time it is, gimme your watch
My gun's already hip-hop, don't make it go pop
Take your men up to catch these punchlines
For only one second, catch a bullet eat your flesh like it's lunchtime
(The ice froze on his neck, that's a fabulous thing
Put in on a milk carton like it's fabulous chain
Them Cali boys insane, homie guard your grill)

[Outro: Jay Rock]
I'ma rob his ass blind, tell me give me them bills
