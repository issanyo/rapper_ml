[Intro: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Your body's calling, your body's calling me
(Give me some of that, give me some of that, that)

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I know what you like, I know what you want
I know what you need, I know how to put you out your misery
A-B (Dash...) S-O-U-L, infinity
When it comes to the possibilities
Anytime you're in my vicinity
And I'll beat it up, yeah, I'll beat it up
Yeah, I'll beat it up, just like it's my enemy
All night, I can't resist, I need it like my pancreas
If you dismiss and no give me kiss kiss, it'll be hard digestin' it
Give me some of that, give me some of that
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
Back it up 'til a nigga say, "That's enough."
Mirror on the ceiling, everything lookin' up
Sweetie, I'm tryna get it in like a suite key
Your skin like sweet tea, I need thee
Look sweet thing, you remind me of my Jeep: your body's callin'
She got work, but I think she finna call in
‘Cause I'm all in that thang
And she probably think I'm in love the way I'm fallin' in that thang
Soulo!

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
This drank here got me leanin'
This reefer keep on screamin'
And I believe that everything happens for a reason
And, girl, you got me fiendin'
I don't care about your religion
‘Cause I just can't resist you, goddamn lust demons

[Post-Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid & Ab-Soul]
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Give me some of that, give me some of that
Give me some of that, give me some of that

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
(Rock!) Leanin' like a mothafucka, I be pourin'
(Black Hippy shit) Higher than a mothafucka, I be blowin'
I'm off that Amber Kush
With a bad lil bitch, call her Amber Rose
She be lovin' the crew and I be lovin' her too
She got a thing for them rap niggas I suppose
She feelin' my energy
I feel on her thighs, she fill up the Hennessy
Now we on the sofa, in a minute I'ma be bendin' her over
She know my motives, tryna get behind it like a locomotive
She trained, she on the right track
Yeah, she got that boomerang, then I'm comin' right back
She ratchet nasty
She got a ring on her tongue and a ring on her clit
Got my hands on my YKK, zip it down, now she all on my tip
She told me, "Look at me when I work my magic, daddy!"
She pulled a rabbit out a hat, made my dick disappear
In thin air, then she brought it right back

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
This drank here got me leanin'
This reefer keep on screamin'
And I believe that everything happens for a reason
And, girl, you got me fiendin'
I don't care about your religion
‘Cause I just can't resist you, goddamn lust demons

[Post-Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid & Ab-Soul]
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Give me some of that, give me some of that
Give me some of that, give me some of that
