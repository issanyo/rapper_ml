[Intro]
Yeah, Jay Rock niggas
Watts Finest, Top Dawg Entertainment
Yeah, I see you boy
K.Dot, gon hit 'em hard with this one
Punch line, on the ones and twos
We finna fuck 'em this year

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock still handle them bills
Watchin' my dollars multiply like Bebe's Kids
I'm fresh plus the watch got a make over
Different colours in the bezel something like Crayolas
I'm from dub city, Dot from hub city
Yeah it's like Pac flowing through my veins, thug in me
I hug semis, hood MVP
All these haters love to envy me, so fuck 'em
Hear my game's proper, I'm bout dollars
Fuck trickin' on a bitch I'd rather buy Impalas
If I gotta pay for it baby I ain't want it
Your pussy probably got a hundred thousand miles on it
With no tune-up, with no oil change
Your best bet put your coochie up for auction mayne
I'm runnin' to the money I ain't stoppin'
Walk around with a stack, that's nothin' but pocket change
Career about to take off like a rocket
When I sell a lot of records you could call it stock exchange
Movin' pounds of that grass, need a weed license
Plus I'm steady gettin' high like the gas prices
If rapping was boxing, I'm Tyson
First round knock out boy, without bitin'
When you gettin' paper
Niggas start to hate ya
You got a problem I'ma solve it call me Perry Mason
I'm from the projects so you know I'm gutter nigga
Keep that Louisville but I'll thirty-eight slug a nigga
When I hit New York you know where I'm at
In the 40-40 club being chic and kickin' back
Walk in Manhattan with my big homies
All in Times Square with the chrome forty-five on me
Then I'm flyin' back to Cali to see my bitches
Then I'm all on Crenshaw, dippin', hitting switches
Then I'm back in the Nickerson Gardens
Fuckin' with big vote and the hit squadron mobbin'
In my black khaki's and corduroys
Been wearin' tees before them franchise boys, you know
Nigga this Top Daw E-N-T
I'm a P-I-M-P, rollin' with my G-A-N-G
Doom Dawg got a nigga stackin' my Benjies
A nigga might purchase the Bentley
Cause Warner Brothers made it official
Like a fat man with stripes that's holdin' a whistle
I'm bout to blow, like bad bitches who suck dick
Or like a dynamite stick that's lit
You haters better take cover
Yeah you fuckin' with a Watts living soldier
Yeah the pressure gettin' heavy got the city on my shoulders
I'm not droppin' it for nobody, nobody gonna stop me
I'm like a freight train on a track
Have you dying in pain on your back, from the Mac
Leave a stain on your steps, leave your brain in your lap
And that's what I call a blowjob
Plus this money got the world turnin' like doorknobs
It could turn your good friend to a foe
It could turn your girlfriend to a ho
It could you make you famous, it could make you change up
On your niggas if you let it
Gotta keep Berettas
Niggas comin' at your cheddar
This is '06 so I got brand new raps
Brand new stacks, brand new straps
All new women, brand new batch
Tell me what you know about that, yeah
It's Jay Rock, yeah niggas know my style
Find me on the block strapped with a forty-cal
Come to your spot black mask on the face
Automatic weapons we'll shove 'em in your face
All in your place, take it straight to the safe
Rob you for your cake then leave without a trace
Travel through the mind of a crook, okay you shook
Out here niggas get murdered for looks
This the land where the shit don't stop
Killer killer Cali, I'll welcome y'all to Watts
