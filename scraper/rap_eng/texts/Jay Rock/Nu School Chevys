[Intro]
It's Jay Rock niggas
Watt's Finest
Listen

[Hook]
I got new school chevys, old school lac's
Step on the scene with the 44s and macs
Better shut yo trap if that thang click clack then yo ass is layin flat
Sittin in the house, cookin up crack
Movin up packs, just to get them stacks
Blowin' smoke out the lac, ridin on these Cali streets dawg you gotta stay strapped

[Verse 1]
Sittin' in the house with that thang cocked
Because I hold more base than a speaker box
I got 100 grand in my sneaker box
Old school Chevy in the lot with no top
You come through stuntin' get that ass shot
Slugs hit your head leave you with no top
Fiends on the block like flies to shit
Know that work, they know that mines the shit
I'm on the block flippin' pounds with bricks
Now we got the block hot like a pile of shit
Smoking on this weed got me paranoid
Pockets all swollen like my money on steroids
Hatin' ass niggas don't test the boy
Bullets leave that ass screaming like Pastor Troy
Hit rollo on that turf yeah he got the toys
Slugs like Michael Jackson they'll touch you boys
AK-47 make a lot of noise
Family at your funeral yeah they're making a lot of news

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
6 4 Chevy with the gold rims
Nigga try to rob he go miss his limbs
A nigga money longer than zentro
And I got a clip longer than imperial
I'm project material
Fuck your name I got a gat for each syllable
I'm in the cut like a can of Raid
If I see a roach creepin' watch the can and spray
I got the rocks in my backpack
Serving fiends I'm tryna get a stack jack
You tryna rob you askin for a nap jack
It's all over when I cock the mac back
Got so much weed I ain't even got Atarax
Blow so much smoke they need to call a hazmat
I ain't with the bullshit nigga betta shut ya trap
Don't want beef, keep it on a meat wrap

[Hook]
