Niggas trash, I get a headache when I play ya'll shit
Same city never switch, I ain't J.R. Smith

Verse 2
Everybody tough it's because of this rap shit

I just keep it a hunnit who could say I ever fronted?

Verse 3
Bout age 9 lil nigga writing some rhymes

Verse 5 [Jay Rock]:
I put that money over rest
Bitch I'm tryna be the best
These lil niggas mad cuz they see we up next
These niggas acting dum ill put these niggas to the test
Boy you ain't Superman so you better have a vest
Whoa
On Ya chest boy you know I keep a tec
And if a nigga playing he might get shot in the neck
Whoa
Ima die for my respect
I keep grinding I don't care about who's next
Boy I'm on my grind
See that money on my mind
Everyday I put in work
See me I don't waste time, no
I gotta grind man I gotta eat
Hustle hard, everyday up in these streets
All my niggas real you know we play for keeps
I keep a Glock just know that I'll pop
If a nigga try to front them niggas really need to stop
Like the Migos I got the streets on lock
I don't give a fuck about these cops
Real nigga I don't fuck with them ops
And if you playing both sides you could get popped
