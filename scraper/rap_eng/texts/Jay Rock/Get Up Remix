[Intro]
Everybody get up, everybody get down now
Can you hear me fucking shit up? Can't break the sound now
Let you get your own beat, get to the ground now
And turn around and tell 'em what you found out

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
You can't tell me nothing cause I see you through my rearview
And everything they say that I didn't do, but look I did do
And lived through episodes, I stayed up professional
Now ladies wait in line and get their selfies after every show
Post that with a hashtag
How to get that money like a rap slash NASDAQ
Show me where the cash at
Call me this, call me that, just call me Daddy Fat Stacks
Headed to the function with my homies, puff and pass that
Sipping out of red cups, hard to stand up
750 ML of that brown'll mess your head up
We just living carefree, we don't give a fuck
My throw have everything, just know we got enough
What's up, whats up?

[Hook]
Everybody get up, everybody get down now
Can you hear me fucking shit up? Can't break the sound now
Let you get your own beat, get to the ground now
And turn around and tell 'em what you found out
Everybody get up, everybody get down now
Can you hear me fucking shit up? Can't break the sound now
What we got gon' make your heart pound pound
And turn around and tell 'em what you found out

[Interlude]
Everybody get up
Everybody get up

[Verse 2]
Never gave a damn about prom king
Always in the parking lot growing smoke wings
We tried to [?] team with Lady Luck
But still we riding with the caddy on the trucks
No good, we ain't got no money, but hey I kicks off for free
Our love and worries are out with the breeze
Cause we got the front to the newbie

[Hook]

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
We shimmy shimmy to the sounds of the timid
We shimmy shimmy to the sounds of the chilling
We shimmy shimmy to the sounds of the shitty
Come on, fucks a little, got me feeling all crazy

[Interlude]
