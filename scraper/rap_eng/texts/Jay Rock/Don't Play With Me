These Niggas be talkin' all that hot shit
But ya'll Niggas need to stop it

And I'm gripped up with that steel
If you run up on me then yo ass will get killed (flatline)
I'm all about this money I need that
Posted on the block where the gz at
Mackin' in the hood with the gz scrap
Heard niggas playing both sides I can't believe that

So I can't fuck with Niggas that's fake so I gotta get this money and stay up in my lane
