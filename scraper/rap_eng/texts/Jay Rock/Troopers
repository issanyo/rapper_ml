[Intro]
Cardo got wings...

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
It's work on the phone
Tell my mama that I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers
I said it's work on the phone
Somebody tell my mama I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
If that's your real nigga, he gon' slide for you
If that's your real nigga, he gon' die for you
You ain't gotta question when it's brackin'
Just point me in the direction when it's action
Day ones in the sandbox, from breakin' through the padlocks
To burners in the stashbox, your whole hood mascots
My whole hood mad Watts, that's gang, gang, gang
We politic, on missions, don't hang, hang, hang
We got bad bitches too, huh, and they blast bitches too, huh
And they shoot the fair one too huh, we can take it there too, huh
Niggas win some and lose some, just went half on the new drum
Summertime is overdue huh, double back when the news come

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
It's work on the phone
Tell my mama that I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers, I said it's work on the phone
Somebody tell my mama I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers

[Verse 2: Jay Rock & Kendrick Lamar]
Back door, back though, east side, we go back door
What you wanna act for? You get what you ask for
Ballin' in the game now, east side, we go back door
(East side, east side, east side, east side, east side)
Nothing is the same now, motherfuck the task force
Came up and I went back, changed up, never did that
If it's taped off, yeah I did that, blew a half a mil, yeah I did that
On the blade girl, is you with that? Ten toes on the pavement
Sell your soul in the Days Inn, shacked up like a caveman
Troopers on deck, secure the bag, we plant the flags
So what we on next? What we on next?
Rock bottom from the NGs, hand guns on the tenth speed
R.I.P. to my dead homies, loyalty is all we need, yeah

[Chorus: Jay Rock]
It's work on the phone
Tell my mama that I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers, I said it's work on the phone
Somebody tell my mama I might not make it home
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers hoppin' in this bitch, poppin' in this bitch
Me and my troopers
