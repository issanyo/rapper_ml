[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
It ain't hard to tell that I live in hell
Sin City watch city gotta get your mail
How I sleep when I die that's real
There's only two ways out: living under the dirt or life in the cell
I'm still on the block tryna make me a sell
You can't make too much, some niggas might tell
That's how it is homie, when you up in your shit
Get locked up, your friends might hook on your bitch
Its fuck a ho, that's why I'm all about my chips
To live and die broke, it's some embarrassing shit
That's why I'm hooking a block, fuck hooking a bitch
When the wars on, I'm bustin' em clips
Shit I'm just trying to stack paper
Blowing big weed, I'm high like a skyscraper
L.A nigga in a New York state of mind
When I rhyme verses like Cool J back in '85, I'm hot lava
Gold d's on my low rider 4'5 so original like a ol' timer
2 pistols, one llama
In the back of the trunk like who want drama? nobody
Sitting back I got this, a project prophet
I could predict when my goons ready to pop shit
When the funds is low
We're on the hunt for tons of blow
Summer time, in Cali homie all we do is snow
Counting dollars, til our hands get callused
Won't stop hustling til the judge bang the gaval
Prayin' for the better days
Sit in the club celebrate
Pop bottles, with top models back on the interstate
Traffic and chickens homie we trying to get it
Then we back in the kitchen whipping like a chemist
Hunger pangs got me acting a fool in that dinner time
Life is like a racing track trying to get to the finish line

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Slaughter pigs like farmer John
My style got its own ambience
You feel my presence? live life like everyday class in session
Learn something after 187 we burn some
For real kid, our uncle doing a 13 year bid
I pray to god he don't come out how he went in
Gets ill, these streets got me packing a 9 mill
My mind stay black, either kill or be killed
It's real in the battlefield son
Last week shawty do wop he at the ooh wop he said he ready to kill some
I said shawty chill, you ain't ready for that type of drama
Plus karma for real
He shook his head, horizontal
He said he was out on consignment some dudes on the block tried to rob em
Try? what you mean?
He said they tried until I reached in to the pocket of my jeans
I killed 2, but one got away which is bad news, because the hood didn't even cover my whole face
And I know he be back, but before he do that
I bring it to him first on the porch where he live at
Damn shawty I can't knock you, its survival of the fittest
With that said, do what you got to
I shook his hand, then I walked away, then reality took a toll on me
Shoulda never gave him that .38
Looking at the ceiling in my bedroom
Then the phone rang, hey K Dot turn on the news
They didn't even say his name
But I knew it was him when it said another 7th grader was slayed
It ain't hard to tell
