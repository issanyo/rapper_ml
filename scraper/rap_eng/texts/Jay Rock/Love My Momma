[Intro]
I'll always love my momma
She's my favorite girl (Only get one)

[Verse 1]
Brought me in this world, first person I saw
After the doctors, the nurses wiped me off
Your touch so soft, I could feel the warmth of your heart through the cloth
Just like that we hit it off, love at first sight
No Shakespeare in here, it's real, it's sincere
Mother dear, my all
Man, I can talk about it all day
Walked me school for ten years, no car
Toys for christmas, wonder how, no job
Corn on a cob, hot meals every night
Talk about when I played with hot wheels every night
Motivation, she gave me inspiration
To be what I wanted, she told me be patient
Your day is coming, the teachers didn't believe in me
My momma said the world needed me
And that's why

[Hook]
I'll always love my momma
She's my favorite girl
(And that's why)
I'll always love my momma
She's my favorite girl
(My momma said the world needed me, and that's why)

[Verse 2]
And that's Mary Lee Williams, my momma, my momma
I love my momma, put that on my momma
March 31st, my birth
She gave me life, Johnny McKenzie III
Word. Kept clothes on my back
Kept shoes on my feet
Kept food on the table for me and my brother to eat
My brother didn't have a daddy, my daddy gone
All we have is each other, and momma's love is forever
And it will never die
Momma, real respected, holy savior, sanctified, well protected
She prays for me daily, I'm still her baby
If I get crazy, momma, she tames me
Momma knows best, momma don't rest
Till I'm in safe and sound, it's safe to say
That momma hold me down, till her dying day, I promise I'll make her proud
Real talk!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
[?] (who there?) Momma
When you're locked up in jail (who there?) Momma
Got no place to go (who there?) Momma
Yeah Momma, yeah Momma
Nobody on your side (who there?) Momma
If you need a shoulder to cry (who there?) Momma
When it's all said and done (who there?) Momma

[Outro]
Love my momma, my momma, my favorite girl
Love my momma, my momma brought me in this world
Love my momma, my momma, my favorite girl
Love my momma more than anything else in the world (x3)
