[Hook]
I got uzis and AKs a plenty
I got gadgets and grenades galore
Every night I make sure that I'm ready
And prepare for war
I got ratchets and TEC-9s and semis
Automatics and shotguns galore
If you fuck with me make sure you're ready
And prepare for war

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I got a problem I think you need to solve it
Damn, you fuckin' with us, you might not ever walk again
Bullets hot dog, it'll burn off your skin
This M16, that'll knock off your limbs
Stick up kids will tell you take of your gems
If not catch a bullet through your jaw and chin
This 38 magnum will blow off your wig
At the light K.Dot will take off your rims
You ain't a hustler, show you how to [?]
Show you how to snatch nick bags, I sell 'em all for ten
I fuck with real niggas, I ain't got time for friends
Keep your enemies close in this game, you win
G shit, this the life I choose
Disrespect me, and I'll beat the life out you
Got a pistol, men pullin' pipes out [?]
Treat 'em like an unpaid bill, popping bullets, lights out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]
If you [?] me too hard then my man will clap ya
He'll leave you on the ground like a candy rapper
Never run from a gun, cause bullets are faster
Have your ass in a church, right in front of the pastor
Niggas run when they hear metal cock
So I know they'll run when the truck open on that pearl yellow drop
Got Glocks on the block like you cops
And two new nigga playin' nine balls fresh out the box
I move with a rocket right, but you could still get
Stabbed in the neck with a pocket knife
Drive by on the [?] bike
Whoever standing out late on the block gettin' chopped tonight
AKs for the [?]
My MPs put, shots in they [?] like they heroin fiends
Now the hood gettin' violence like Taliban
I[?] like Kelly Grace runnin' the marathon

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Hand me the shit up off the dresser
Toss me the clip you never know who wanna test us
I lift poles like an exercise, wet you guys
Leave your ass on the curb, left to dry
Who's next to try, who's next to die (tell me)
Who's spirit is next to fly
I'm from the hood so I fuck the [?]
OG niggas turn your ass to a vegetable
Shots rang out, lives is taken
And that family [?] back in that hearse they chasin'
Be ready for war, if you mention my name
Yeah that black Mac-10 leave that body in pain
Everybody wanna wear a rag in the wrong place
At the wrong fuckin' time have you [?]
If you don't make it then your toe grab a tag
[?] then your body go sizzle in ash

[Outro][x2]
Money buys [?]
That's the way, against the rules
I don't know, what you been told
Where you been before, but that's how it goes
