[Intro]
I put my money on Mayweather
I got my money on Mayweather
I put my money on Mayweather

[Verse 1]
I put my money on Mayweather
Made paper of them MGM fights
Betted all on my nigga, left the ring with bragging rights
Bob and weave, left and right
Where my Gs? Countin', nigga
Throw them combinations
Just wait, I bet he counter, nigga
Yeah, you fuck-niggas couldn't fuck with him
Get fucked over, tell Mills Lane come get him
Break your eggs, champin' every cat that run with him
Throw a single punch, nigga thought a gun done hit him
I go dumb, throw dum-dums at dumb niggas' craniums
Watch 'em cheer in 'em stadiums
I'm off my rocker, throwin' noodle knockers, go to sleep
Stand over him till he wake up, so he know that's me
Remember what's-his-name? Oh, he's a has-been
Which one you talkin' about? I score Ricky Hatton
I throw 'em all off the ropes, no joke
Tryin' to get paid, let 'em know

[Hook]
I put my money on Mayweather
Put your money up, put your money up, put your money up
I got my money on Mayweather
Put your money up, put your money up, put your money up
I put my money on Mayweather
Put your money up, put your money up, put your money up
I got my money on Mayweather
Put your money up, put your money up, put your money up

[Verse 2]
See, you lookin' at a champion, who want to debate about it?
Wreck a ho, no losses, nothin' you can say about it
Gators in my closet, Pretty Boy Floyd
Black on black Rolls Royce, only made for the bosses
Boss of all bosses, should I name-drop?
Or, better yet, name some names that I ain't dropped
Ain't your man, Freddie, want no challenge, uh-uh
Arturo Gatti, he ain't got no talent, uh-uh
Zab Judah, what a loser, where the hell he come from?
DeMarcus Corley slumped 'em, I run from no one
I've done impossible
I've killed so many boxers, dreams they could prosecute
Hip-hop's went possible
This little nigga got a big heart and a big bite
A big bark with a bigger bite, you talk, you pay the price
Pacquiao flake, he don't want no money, man
About to take my frustration out on "Sugar" Shane

[Hook]
