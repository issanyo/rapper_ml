[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I'm just dwelling in the ghetto, puffing on that you know
My relly fresh outta jail, he still sippin' on puno
Me and day unos kickin' it like judo
Will I survive another day, nigga, who knows?
Hood rats bobbin' steady shakin' that culo
Tryna get some dollars, fucking every nigga you know
But this the gutter, look, I love it to death
And I'm gon' represent my city 'til it ain't nothing left
Coming out the bottom of Watts, bangers poppin' them shots
Niggas whippin' the rock for the guap, it don't stop
Nigga rode through my bricks, people poverty stricken
Border the buildings, little babies, they be witnessin' killings
Fuck one time, they don't give a fuck 'bout our feelings
Talking 'bout some gang injunction, lock us up for just chillin'
Damn, it's Jay Rock, shit, I gotta be real with it
And it's my struggle and my pain, gotta deal with it

[Hook: Kenfolks da Great (x2)]
Ah, rude boy from the beginning and
I never surrender, keep drilling 'em
We know to strike with precision
Tear down buildings, take what's not given

[Verse 2: Kenfolks da Great]
Me, young shorty, original rude boy
Young go-getter, good with a tool, boy
See that there, boy? See them there, boy?
One pop, body dropped, that clear the air, boy
Me no decoy, I do what I do, man
Do it for big dollars, you do it for small change
I'm that new strain, Casey in the flesh
Put that thing in your chest, bang 'til there's nothing left
I'm here in the hood, you know where to find me
One track mind, y'all can't rewind me
Or co-sign me, I'll sign myself
Put my city on my back and waved off the help
Hit the game like stealth, SR-71
Got 'em all shook, like "Where it come from?"
West side of the map, North on the South side
Rep where you from, go ahead and throw your 6 high
Show 'em how we ride, Lexus, Chevrolets
Beef come, mark it off, from the A to the K
You can get right here in broad day
Beef come, we mark it off, from the A to the K

[Hook: (x2)]

[Verse 3: Wais P]
You try'na act like our word ain't shit
I mean, you try'na act these joints don't hit
We come through amp slappin' in a Volks four-door wagon
Four hoes ready to work, my true religion saggin'
No acting, put my life on a track
Make your wife look twice when I pass, and that's how it happens
Give a fuck if you're backpacking or rapping about trapping
Have respect or we pitching your brain fragments
Listen, we turn ignition on sports cars
With the tails fishin' in the rain with the roof missin'
And the ACR, you made me warm
But this ain't just being eloquent on a song
Naw, this is rap on heron, pure white, Charlize Theron
LSD tabs to tear on, Vicoden bars that got me writing on Mars
Doing a buck past the fuzz, we inciting the law, fuck 'em

[Hook: (x2)]
