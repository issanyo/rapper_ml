[First Verse: Huffy]

I took my conscious stream and ran with it
Satan tries to be the man, I'm more ham, sandwiches
And these damn witches, brewing up some bullshit in they cauldron my mind dismantles it
I go harder than the devil never let him handle shit, growing towards the cosmos meaning outward since they planted it
Calling myself it cause My soul projected on the canvas bitch

My Conscious not infected like half of the planet is
Sanded wits
Ample kids
Getting raised up to be mannequins
More than the surface they can't handle it

The fraction of life they live happens to barely even be a decimal
No wonder why they can't get their heads wrapped around extra terrestrials
While my sights celestial like poles and my ancient ancestrals

Fuck everything that's federal
They convinced the masses of solutions so painfully ephemeral
Said your smile'd be nicer if you drank water, tainted with venom though
Elitests are so sour not as healthy as a lemon though

So I let em know
Keep your sphere open unlike the letter O


[Bridge: Huffy]

I goes with the flows
Rose with the crows
Inside My soul knows that my prose flows past my own goals

In time I'll compose, all the meanings I propose
The bullshit decompose and the fools get dethroned

Still I seek home
Oblique to how the streets grown
Mystique zone, open projections like a free throw
I peak slow confront my evils
This life's a doorway and I'm peaking through the key hole


[Second Verse: Huffy]

Cutting fine lines through this heavy dense matter, on some Annunaki shit
Been searching my whole life for a higher realm like where the
Annunaki live
Were just on a single frequency like a walkie talkie is

I want the inner secrets of these outer entities, elitests out here talking shit
Stuck in the mud like the children's game
Think the Feds sucked on my blood nah I'm still the same
I exterminated those pests when I opened my mind and spilled the flame
I killed the game

What I instill is real and humane
My synapses spark fire don't need butane (flame)
Saying N O to Feds like Tulane, (wooh!)
Slain
(dang)


[Interlude: Carl Sagan]

The surface of the earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean, on this shore we learn most of what we know

I believe our future depends powerfully on how well we understand this cosmos, in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky

[Third Verse: Huffy]

Young natural magic
Tectonic acrobatics
Lysergic acid diethyl-amide had my mind galactic
Double doses under folded fabric
Wrap the Dana round my data so my neuro tunnels grow elastic

My shit is so past a classic
Reject the government cause it's always been fascist
I fucking hate plastic
I love acid, and tree so fucking pass it pass it pass it
Rolling on these pretty bits of mary like some cabbage patches
