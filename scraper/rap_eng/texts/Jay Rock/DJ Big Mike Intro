Ladies and Gentlemen
I go by the name of the Big Mike
Seven years strong in the game
Steady on my motherfucking grind
No sleep til the work gets done
Long slide to my nigga DJ Envy doing a lot of big things
And my homie DJ Warrior on the West Coast
As we bring to you
Jay Rock, my man K. Dot
These intense motherfuckers are co-running the game to make a dent in this bitch
Shoutout to Sound Wave, Top Dawg Entertainment
You know what I mean?
Everyone out in the East Coast get the fuck behind this shit
You know what it is
You know what I mean?
This shit right here is called " No Sleep Til NYC"
We on the grind real heavy
You know, caught on the right dues man
Punch what up, I gotcha
It's really nothing
Big Mike, DJ Envy, DJ Warrior
Shoutout my motherfucking man DJ Ski, too
