Westside Radio
Look check it out

[Verse: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock is the name
K Dot is the name
Top Dawg Entertainment is the name
I'm in it too, 20 years in the game
1580K day, 1986
You got me right here going 2008
Ain't no sleep till we get to NYC
That's the way we do it
From the West Coast, straight to you
Niggas who guard the projects, stand up
West Side certified, baby
It's West Side Radio, I'm in here
Julio G, let's go, Jay Rock
