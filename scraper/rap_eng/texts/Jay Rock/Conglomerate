[Verse 1]
Respect my conglomerate, Watts City monument
I rock plenty blocks
Plenty hoes drop plenty off the tops when I'm rhymin' it
Bringin' in revenue, this requitable untreadable
Put me on a pedestal, I'll stay up there
Schoolin' the youth, y'all are welcome to my daycare
Strike like a bright match in the night
Attack like a lion when you ain't tamin' her right
Pull my aim to get right to your cranium
Bars are titanium, cocaine from Cuba, choppers from Iranians
Coupe like a UFO, welcome to Alien
I'm E.T. in the GT and I'm rapin' them
Fuckin' them, no Vaseline
Good night, then I'm talkin' them mafia screams
Silent cries of a coward
Kid said it best, gotta kill 'em in the shower
And I don't smoke diesel if the taste ain't sour
And I don't fuck with him if he ain't one of ours
I represent the Towers
Hangin' on a motherfucker startin' on my set gang
Bangin' on 'em motherfuckers
Respect it or check it, I'm nothin' to mess with
MÃ©nage with my bitch and my exes, I'm that cold
Shit, got a bitch that's thick as my bankroll
Puffin' up two Ls, I'm wearin' the Kangol
Draped in gold like I strode by a rainbow
I'll rob Slick Rick, I ain't poppin' big shit
Poppin' big clips, AR, firm grip
Dominique Dawes, make every one of y'all flip
I light the chronic and get high
So high, I can play dominoes with God
Breakin' bread with the disciples and sip wine
Come back down and tell you I had a good time
West Coast dime like the sunset
Don't worry 'bout me, I ain't have a son yet
They pray for my downfall
They want to walk in my shadow like a groundhog
These niggas is Barbie dolls
Bitches with four legs
Before I fuck, shit, I need head
Doin' bad, then askin' you for bread
Rasta, those are the days that I tread
Case closed, right back on the road with it
Pimp shit, whatever I say, she roll with it
Smash a live nation way before Hov did it
Polo Dickies, cut low-low fitted
Low-low on Melrose, tap switches
Eight (?) and Jehovahs bear witness
I was taught, "Stay with your gun and mind your business"
And windows just glass and niggas will jump in it
You think it's all love, but we ain't playin' no tennis
Niggas that will smoke you, local henchmen
Riders, looters, drivers benchin'
.38, special edition, no mask on
