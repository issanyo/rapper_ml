[Intro]

[Verse 1: Emjae]

I'll admit in the beginning I didn't give a fuck about you
You came and you went, thought I could choose living without you
But now I'm feelin' sick cause your ass ain't around
You cheatin' on me (bitch), with every motherfucker in town
I tried to play it like it's cool, but I feel the repercussion
On top of that your ass is rollin' round with my cousin
I think I passed the breaking point cause I done copped a pound
I hear you streaking through nigga's pockets, I'm layin' 'em down
(Gimme that) And I ain't stoppin' 'till you trapped in the safe
Now my base ain't safe so we could skip three states
Switch place after the break, more moves to make
Cause I'm in love with this trap ass bitch called Kate
This [?] money gon keep me from looking funny
And bummy, let her run me cause she bout it
Monday through Sunday we don't play no games here
You know how we get down, you know all the hoes love me
Money makes the world go round

[Hook]

So I'ma kick in the door
With the Mac 10, or the lone 44
Screaming give me the dough back nigga
Please, don't ask no questions
This a robbery nigga
You already know

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]

Yo pockets kinda thin, shawty wanna go out on a date
Shit I got no chips to spend, but I said it's OK
Cause momma was drivin' the Benz
Her Jimmy Choos had me convinced
I said she was pretty, she love a nigga compliments
I had the thing with me, she didn't know
By the end of the day, she be breakin' off them arguments
I said fuck the ass and titties
I want the jewels and Benjies
I swear a nigga pockets was empty, starving
I whispered to myself, a nigga bout to come up
She like "Oh I beg your pardon"
Oh nothing, I was thinking bout your valet parking
Excuse me, now give me the [?] I know they [?]
I don't wife usually, but today I'll be your man
So we went to the restaurant, I said OK
I think about the getaway shit, over lunch
Like what type of jewels I want, everything
I ain't goin' back to the block 'till her body is clean
Snatch it off her cuticles, takin' off the pinky ring
I know this shit good but it bad as it seems
So hate conversation, little does she know
That nigga like you and me was patiently waiting, give it up
I wanted heartbeat, now thanks for the business
Go home, oh yeah please call me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]

Yeah, a nigga starving out front of your place
Put the beam to your face, I don't really want the safe
I want everything in your house
From your TVs, couches your dog and your spouse
Everything is valuable, so is you
Cooperate so a nigga won't have to blast you
We all know what this Mac could do
At point blank range, it's a closed casket fool
I'm the Watts bandit, yeah I came up
Put all these goods in a pick-up truck
Rollin' down Central, I spotted me a target
This nigga, he was doin too much flossin'
Yea the truck I parked it
Hop out cock back the heater
Run up in his ass in his beemer
I'm yellin' out, "hand it over, 'fore it's all over"
Put a shell through you and your mother fucking chauffer
He was looking choked up, so he start sweating'
Looking down the barrel of my Wesson
Yeah he's getting robbed, he know he can't stop it
He gave me the keys, and every fucking thing up in his pockets
Started up the Beemer, parked it where my truck was
Young niggas like "what up blood"
I'm like what up blood, this nigga came behind me
Said "hand is over nigga, or that your ass is mine"
