[Verse 1]
Twelve o'clock on the dot, slugs in my Glock
Rocks in my sock, I'm just tryin' to get guap
Yeah, brick livin', survival of the fittest
Where I'm from in the projects is anybody killer
Goons in the alleyway, goblins on the roof
Ks in the bushes, one time crooked
YGs cookin', OGs lookin'
They tried to rob the spot but they got their life tooken
Young niggas ain't playin', these young niggas preyin'
So many bodies droppin', mama in the church prayin'
Hoes on the track, suckin' and they fuckin' for stacks
Niggas in the trap, dumpin' and they pumpin' them packs
Niggas, they be snitchin', makin' they hard to relax
Double always busy, so I'm constantly watchin' my back
Los Angeles, land of the scandalous
Actin' like you're sweet, you could get your banana split

[Hook]
It's midnight, twelve o'clock to be exactly
If you want it, I can show you where it's at
Make sure you got some bullets in your gat
Fuck, where you fuck-shitters, where you at?
Midnight, wolves lurkin' after dark
In the midnight, sharks are (?)
In the midnight, boy, you better have some heart
Every man for himself when that clock strikes twelve

[Verse 2]
When nighttime falls, lifelines lost
You can hear if from blocks when 'em four-fives bark
Smoke to get high just to pass time
If I'm low on the dough, nigga, then it's trap time
Work on the saucer plate, choppers by the screen door
Infiltrate, no hesitatin' that is seen, boy
Fuck a narc, fuck a fed, bitches out for the bread
Want to see a nigga right in jail
Crackers tryin' to trap us in the corner, tryin' to put them Ls on us
Watch what's up with them football numbers
Shit, it goes down in the late night
Death in the air, can't imagine what it feels like
In the gutter, we ain't lookin' for no cuddy buddy
Hoes get passed around like drug money
In the land where the man want to see us crumble
Nigga, welcome to the concrete jungle

[Hook]
