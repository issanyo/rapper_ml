(Verse 1)
If I die tonight, where'd I go
Thinkin' nigga might go to heaven fo sho
Never thought about the afterlife, till I start seeing
Most of my niggas losing their life to the streets
Got me thinkin' about all my good deeds
Times that I helped someone that was in need
Seen a friend fallen I put him back on his feet
Gave him somethin' never asked for back, that was just me
Forgave my pops for leavin' us in the streets
Stood my mam on when she was strung out over the D
Never disrespected my elders, never envy
My heart wasn't borned to be jealous, that wasn't in me
Appreciated everyday I woke up to breath
Pray to the man upstairs before I sleep
If I die tonight, where'd I go
Got me really wonderin', I don't know
Damn!

(Chorus)
If I die tonight, where'd I go
Heaven or hell, I don't know
If I die tonight, where'd I be
Please forgive me for [???]

(Verse 2)
If I die tonight, where'd I go
Thinkin' nigga might go to hell fo sho
Could it be, because I sold my own folks dope
Other time that I gave to lil boy that toast
To ride around town and look for niggas to smoke
If you really think about it, it's murder [???]
All the disrespectful words I spoke
And all the women hearts I broke, I'm not perfect
Remember the days when the nigga was livin' worthless
Gang bangin' and [???] niggas out of purpose
Cock back [???] slugs for the hood I love
My brain was cloudy from all 'em drugs
Wishin' death for my enemies
The truth will come out when I drinkin' that Hennessy
If I was really die tonight, where'd I go
To be honest homie, I don't know
Damn!

(Chorus)
If I die tonight, where'd I go
Heaven or hell, I don't know
If I die tonight, where'd I be
Please forgive me for [???]
