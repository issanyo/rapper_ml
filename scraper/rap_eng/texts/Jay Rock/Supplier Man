[Hook: Jay Rock]
I'm ya supplier man, I'm ya supplier man
I got that fire, I promise I'll get you higher, come and holla, and-
When you spark it up, it's gon' put you out
And if you try to play me, I'mma put you out

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man
Nick bags, dime bags, dub bags, gone fast, quick cash
I'm the supplier, get you higher fast
Five-O patting us down now, we gotta stash stacks
My caine you can't match that
Multiple rocks up in my knapsack
Beam on my black gat
You see me on the corner, don't be scared to ask that
Don't be surprised when I ask you where my cash at
Them girls wearing them jeans that show they buttcrack
My bitch can't wear that, why? That's where my straps at
I put the smash down, on any who dare rat (snitches)
I catch you with the cheques you headed for a down trap
Fiends remember my name
And I keep it the same
From January to December I give you a caine
So just light up your thang
Please bring me your bullets
I'm the supplier man
[?] all in my drugs

[Hook]
I'm ya supplier man, I'm ya supplier man
I got that fire, I promise I'll get you higher, come and holla, and-
When you spark it up, it's gon' put you out
And if you try to play me, I'mma put you out

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
They call me J.R., but I ain't the Birdman Junior
Rollin' up spliffs 'bout as long as a ruler
I'm so sharp like a harpoon
Shirt animated somethin' like a cartoon
(Listen) I got that water resin silver spoon
Here to hang your neck and hearin' different tunes
That's what that sherm'll do
Settin' up shop like a carnival
Got more bombs than the army, fool
That plenty arsonal
We got that snow in that sunny state
We be chopping rocks for so long, 'til our hands ache
We got connects in another state
You sniff lines? Here's another plate
Just have your fun today
When you grind hard, watch dreams come true
If you ever try to play me, hit you with that semi baby
Have you in a box like two pairs of shoes
With no chest, shouldn't have played yourself

[Hook]
I'm ya supplier man, I'm ya supplier man
I got that fire, I promise I'll get you higher, come and holla, and-
When you spark it up, it's gon' put you out
And if you try to play me, I'mma put you out

[Verse 3: C-Bo]
Yes, I'm Cadillac pimpin'
Cooking coke in the kitchen
That judge still want me to stop, I won't listen
Hoes still hot on the block, I'm still pitchin'
White gold all on the watch, cause I'm pimpin'
Something you seen in magazines, so clean
I live my sex life shelltoes, please no cream
Boys keep it calm you know my cup full of lean
I play that game by myself, I don't need no team
Yeah I know I'm cocky, enemies wanna drop me
B-O goin' straight to the top, you can't stop me
Plus I put the pipe in your neck, you can't knock me
Hustle everyday in the streets, 'till cops pop me
See you all running when I'm pulling that TEC out
Say you want beef, well I'll show you what Bo's 'bout
I'm from these streets, so I'll travel the next route
The homies out deep, and they sticking they chests out

[Hook]
I'm ya supplier man, I'm ya supplier man
I got that fire, I promise I'll get you higher, come and holla, and-
When you spark it up, it's gon' put you out
And if you try to play me, I'mma put you out
