[Verse Three: Papoose]
Somebody gon' get laid out, pull the gauge out, blow his brains out
He tough, let it hang out, pus, let it drain out
Pull the shank out, cut his vein out
Nigga came out with his chain out and his shades out
And his braids out, said he hates East and he hates South
Talkin with a hate mouth, I'll smack the taste out
Now he stashed in a bodybag with his head out
Shotty blast, everybody dash when I bang out
I give orders like take-out
He ain't wanna play the house, but he's aced out
Whatchu fist fightin for? Whacha face 'bout?
I put the +Flava to Ya Ear+ when the +Mack+ blow the +Craig+ out
Make 'em hit the ground like the {?} threw his leg out
Scream at the crowd, where they ball we ain't came out
And show him with the Auto like T-Pain mouth
Pa-POOSE, Pa-POOSE, I'mma show 'em what my name 'bout!

Yea - better hope the shoe don't fit 'em
If it do (whaaaaa??), you through
Fuck you and yo' crew

[Verse Five: Young Chris]
Bodybags Balboa bitch I got a "ay" for your Rocky ass
Leavin holes all up in yo' face, like a hockey mask
Want drama let it be, put 'em under Pleasure P
Put 'em to the test and see, bet you niggas rest in P-E-A-C-E, too raw for TV
Meet your maker +Final Destination+ hater 3D

[Verse Six: Jay Rock]
Who followed me home?! Drop it like Angola stones
Poppin my disc is like poppin ya dome
With the K/Kay, +Slay+ rappers in the circumference of the own home
It's my world, see my face in the ozone? (Whoo!)
Before I was on the cover of magazines

Clips like a hairdresser, getcha doobie clean
Welcome to Hell mister, I own niggas and cheese
