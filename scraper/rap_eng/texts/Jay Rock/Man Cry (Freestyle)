[Intro]
Yeah, It's your boy Jay Rock
Watts Finest, Top Dawg E-N-T
[?] I just got somethin' to get of my chest
You know, you know what I'm sayin' man
Ain't doin' too much
Just tryin' to maintain you know

[Verse: Jay Rock]
I'm the Watts kept secret, J-A-Y
Plus we known for them birds [?]
Look, we got work at a reasonable price
That'll have your fiends higher than the S-K-Y
Nigga, In my hood I been and done
My name ring bells like horns and intercoms
Rollin' through Watts, yeah it's something like Vietnam
Niggas at war better throw on your teflon
In my new ride, Rock whip with his left arm
Pedal to the metal, handgun in my right palm
Grip tight like pythons
Bitch niggas run when the fight's on
And scary ass niggas need to sleep with their lights on
A lot of bad bitches, gotta pull the right one
A ho will have you broke, I'll be damned if I wife one
I ain't gone lie homeboy, I like some
Cause I'm that hamburger that's in between chick's buns
When they on their knees, they can't wait till the kids come
Straight down the hole, now they lost in the system
Look, when there's beef niggas look for a victim
Buck buck he down, have his family missing him
It's rough man these gardens not sweet as a cinnamon
When you got money you'll be hated by many men
You can't leave your house without your gat in hand
If you don't shoot first nigga, that's your ass
Look, niggas throw bricks and they hide their hands
Keep your enemies close, nigga watch your friends
Like Pac said, Death Around the Corner is true
When we bend them corners gotta keep a burner or two
Yeah we know death is promised can't escape from the dude
But we going out blasting like a soldier would do
Feds have my hood hot, like a bowl of that soup
Raiding spots, took them birds right up out of the coop
Put us in a setback, it was hard to [?]
Bounce back like juvie, middle finger the cops
I had my index finger on the trig on the Glock
Selling rocks on the block, pitchin' ready to pop
When you're getting paid haters love to say that you're changed
They ain't never gave you shit so you don't owe 'em a thing
Look some niggas, they'll sell their soul for the fame
Get money, fuck bitches, that's the laws of this game
Nigga
