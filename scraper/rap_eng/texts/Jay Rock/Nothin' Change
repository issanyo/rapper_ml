[Intro]
Uh, yeah, Jay Rock, Watts' finest
Top Dawg Entertainment, what's happenin', boy?
Yeah, how these niggas like to run they mouth?
Don't know what they gettin' theyself into
They gon' learn, uh, I'm goin' in, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Real niggas do real things
Bitch-niggas, they'll sell their soul for the fame
Even if I'm broke, I'm a roll for the flame
On the block, set-trippin', motherfucker, nothin' changed
Don't get it twisted cause I'm rhymin' on a track
Yeah, I'm the type of nigga leave you dyin' on your back
In a black Cadillac with a diamond in the back
With four grimy niggas with a llama and a MAC
Niggas run they mouth like they can't be touched
'Til them shots go off, leave his ass on hush
Look, his boy got hit, left his ass on crutch
You ain't got no gat, you shouldn't talk so much
Nigga, get caught slippin', motherfucker, that's yo' ass
Got a hundred rounds in it, you ain't runnin' that fast
My advice: get a gat and some niggas
Cause if you talk about me
Then I'm comin' to get you, motherfucker

[Hook]
I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
Don't make me put this in your mouth
That's the sound of a shotty
I can show you how to catch a body, a body

I don't know why you talkin' shit
Gon' make me empty out this clip
That's the sound of a shotty
I can show you how to catch a body, a body

[Verse 2]
This for my 8 Ball 'Ciples, woodgrain grippers
Make the shotty go bang, got to body a nigga
For my 211 hustlers known to dope smuggle, bruh
For the right Jay-Z, I'll rob a motherfucker, uh
I'm from the Hub City, now come fuck with me
I got them bands for sale, I spent a dub with me
My face in the crack, could sniff powder
Them niggas be runnin' the block all through the hours
Fuck it, my nigga, we want that money and the power
If a deal go bad, watch that chopper start choppin'
Tear your whole block
And if a nigga want to hit, I'll box him out like Robin
It's T-O-P D-A-W-G E-N-T until I D-I-E
Feelin' like 'Pac, fuck the blow, you're my enemies
TNGs get your knocked off before that nigga on the 10ths be

[Hook]
