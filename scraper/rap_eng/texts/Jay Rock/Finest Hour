[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
And so I party like it's 2012
Split the swisher open, put the green inside the L
Cause any day I could take an L
So my niggas gather around so they love the smell
This that kush my nigga, don't ever breathe, inhale
Lets get high touch the heavens, cause we in this hell
I'm thinkin' at times if I could take a shell
Livin' for the moment right now, I don't really care
My bitch rockin' Chanel, she ghetto sidity
Magnificent ass, incredible titties
She like to pull on my zipper when I'm on the highway
Doin' 85 and the '85 Sade
In the background, got my hat down
Feeling like a king, shout out to Sac Town
You lookin' at a gangsta in his finest hour
Till they lock me up or rain on me lead showers

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Even if I ain't got a watch on my wrist
I can still tell you what time it is
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Still hustlin' same clothes when the sun come up
Been down so long the only way is up
Cause I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Gangsta in his finest hour

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
(Boss) Fascinated with the gold Daytons
(Ross) Fast paper was the motivation
Jay got the es√©s, I know the Haitians
When I'm in LA we meet at Crustaceans
Butterfly all kilos
Show me the money cause I gotta feed my ego
Fuck a Bent coupe when all my niggas' rent due
Put my life on it, I can show you how a brick move (Whip It)
Baking soda make it moonwalk
White glove money stuffed in my tube socks
Top down thug life, 2Pac
I'mma boss, I can get ya whole crew chopped
Teflon Don on the rise
After 4 or 5 lines it's organized crime (Boss)
Mo money, Mo power
The world is yours, that's until I get my lead shower

[Hook]
Even if I ain't got a watch on my wrist
I can still tell you what time it is
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Still hustlin' same clothes when the sun come up
Been down so long the only way is up
Cause I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Gangsta in his finest hour

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Overlookin' the skyline
Got money, wish it could buy time
Watch hustlas in they prime get confined to a 5x9, by a 5 star grind
I'm talking big money, boats and fur coats
Cars and gold ropes, scales and mo' dope
My big homie loaf, had it by the loaf
Got knocked, system tryna hang him by his throat
Downfall is when you considered the top dog
So my eyes open while I'm on top dog
Let them pussy niggas hate, I'mma do me
Fuck menage a trois, I'mma do 3
Roll up the doobie, let it burn slow
Let ya hair back, sip on this Merlot
You lookin' at a gangsta in his finest hour
Till they lock me up or rain on me lead showers

[Hook]
Even if I ain't got a watch on my wrist
I can still tell you what time it is
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Still hustlin' same clothes when the sun come up
Been down so long the only way is up
Cause I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Gangsta in his finest hour
