[Hook: June Summers]
I'm a army all by myself
A soldier if nothing else
An army (I ball) and I want it all (I want it all)
Them O.G.s that brought us up
Them young boys that's coming out
The wars speak won't stop with the call (won't stop with the call)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Look, I'm from the hood, won't never turn my back on it
Got balls tryin' to make it with this rap homie
And the boy get his hustle on
Keep my 45, I don't need no muscle homes
Got the heart of a hundred soldiers
Got my town on my back, and it feels like a hundred boulders
Now that's pressure, the boy never fold with it
Serve you a dish, look nigga I'm cold with it
In the bricks with my 'G'-double 'O'-'N's
Mack 10 loaded im my 5-double 'O'-benz
Ridin' on my enemies, got no time for friends
All about business, got my eyes on ends
Homies said they're your homies, some niggas pretend
Forget about your ass, when you hit that penn
Jay Rock and Nipsey, yeah we out to win
Red and blue make green, bitch niggas hating

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Look, our city never quite shook off
The recipes of Ricky Ross
Couple of niggas rolled, but most just took a loss
While the real bosses passed bills in city hall
Legislate the law for the niggas that cookin' raw
The razor blades and rocks get cut on fine china
My blocks economics like the beers [?]
The black man's sacrificial land for the concept
A land based on the false prospect of progress
For instance
[?]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Look, my niggas crooked though it seems
My every single thoughts caught up in collectin' cream, a made nigga
Picture me dyin' in the blaze of gunfire
Will not retire till I'm paid till I reach the pie
When we ride we fly by bitches blow me kisses
Niggas from Compton to Brooklyn come on get your riches
From Crenshaw to 1-2-5 and do or die
Rollin' with niggas from Long Beach to Long I
I'm heartless now cause my heart froze
Once I commence my show I rip apart foes
Now I got one nation just a crooked compilation
Just the inner bullshit let's get back to money makin'
Tell them bustas that I rolled on controllin' a house
My shit's so wicked when I flip niggas closin' they mouthh
Them cocoa brothers, Buckshout the beady eyed thug
Greg Nice, LS, Asu, sure show a nigga love Outlaw!
