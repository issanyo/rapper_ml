Sound without Focus... is just noise

[Crooked I]
Yo, everywhere I travel, them Dre haters babble
Them niggas is afraid, they bleed Minute Maid
Producers so comfortable living in his shadow
They sip lemonade, chilling in the shade
Who's responsible for the sickest instrumentals made?
Who made Ren a villain and Eminem a renegade?
Now niggas getting paid, menaces in the stage
Hitting listeners with explicit sentences in the page
Since N.W.A, we've been that deep
I'm a part of that family, even if I'm the black sheep
'Cause I was signed to the giant of the West coast
The company Dre built - yeah nigga, Death Row
And whoever bought the catalog, get at 'er dog
Don't try to drop my old shit unless I said so
I write rhymes like a helluva thesis
While Focus... move keyboard keys with telekinesis
It's for the Doc, th-th-the doc

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
Ready or not, here we come
This here's for all the ones who don't believe
This time out, we'll show and prove
Nothing can stop us now

[Jay Rock]
Dre brought you 6-4's
808, black khaki suits, Raider caps and AKs'
Dre, put it down for N.W.A
Back in '92, tell me who fuckin with Dre?
Who made it cool to shoot a cop?
187 on an undercover, remember the record? It was hot
I was like six, in the bricks, when The Chronic dropped
Shit sold out in every momma and poppa shop
Dre, yeah that nigga killing 'em
Sold a lot of records worldwide, who serious?
Dre, I know them haters ain't hearing this
One of the bests on the beats - period
Dre, who put Compton on the map?
Yeah, and responsible for this gangsta rap
My nigga Dre, been through tribulations and trials
Look at him now, you see the aftermath

[Chorus]

[KIDA]
Man, get it out, we all know that Diggy-Doc started this
The evolution of gangsta rap at its best, kid
And Doc Dre is considered the blueprint
Compton, way before Jay thought of doing it
I never puff but I knew dude's on it
Couple spins later, felt high listening to The Chronic
Far from a dumb, but the gangstas are feeling him
It's Inglewood city, but N.W.A is still in him
Six-fo's switch flat, bumping Dre in the back
Eighth grade, King Starter jacket, yeah I had that
Gave Snoop came back, put Em on his back
Who was movin units like that? Where these labels at?
Death Row artist, coulda been that, but I passed
Yeah the truth hurts, so I'm guessin I'm the aftermath
Who else but Doc told you to say F whoever
Front if you want, but for Detox I'll wait forever

[Chorus]
