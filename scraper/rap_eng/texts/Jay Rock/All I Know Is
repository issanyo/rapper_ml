[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Everybody focused on this animal
Someone who push the envelope, the remedy the antidote
Mix the Henny and the Coke
Sell the tree and the dope
Rain sleet and the snow, do we sleep? Hell no
Pop a tag and pull up in a Elco
Bag a bitch at Elco, run up in her tailbone
Grindin cuz I sell mo, hotter then that hell boy
Fresher than an altoid, see me in them tabloids
Actin like a damn fool, running from them bad boys
Keep a Will Smithon Wessen
BIG shell out my weapon, hit you like an astroid
Get high wit androids
I'm outta space wit this shit
Pass the L to Elroy. I ain't took a L boy
I ain't never lost nigga. big heat on me blood
Click defrost nigga. Lookin at a boss nigga
Fuck you an yo boss nigga
Iron on me, ever see a hunter play golf nigga?

[Hook]
Lotta niggas don't wanna see me shine

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Top of the morning while niggas yawnin

Guerilla Warfare, bananas in the regal trunk
Get you cerebral slumped, my shotty is the people's pump

Breakin' niggas off like a Kit-Kat

California I'm the Pharaoh Head starin down the barrel
Of a nine if you don't recognize, boy
Get yo' attitude set aside. I gotta team of choppers for you jealous guys
Haters, they don't really want to see me shine
So I hit 'em where it hurts when they see me ride
With two bad bitches with some chinky eyes
After I was in the club wit my heat inside
