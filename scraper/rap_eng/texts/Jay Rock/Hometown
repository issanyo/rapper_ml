[Intro: Glasses Malone]
Yeah
It's only right that you hear from the hometown hero
Capital!
G-mothafuckin' Malone
Badass blue vision

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
Check, I do it for the Eastside
Mad ass Eastside
Only drag and saggin', breathe in and leave the beach fried
That's from Watts, I could never let you geeks slide
Cobbler to this fat boy, y'all see this peach pride
And that's the difference, ain't nothin' soft about me
Not only Watts but Compton, shit, they all be lost without me
So how can niggas doubt me?
Came at ya [?]
Gone it, we was dumpin' water like the fountains
Couple men accountin', when 100 dollars off of council
Who could cancel any nigga with diarrhea of the tonsils
Your family mourning like Alonsle when we shoot
That's how Watts raised us; like pigeons in the coop
Some of us fly away, others land on the roof
Or get locked in the cave, when the eagles come to swoop
So this for every crip, or every nigga that sawoop
And I feel like a soldier, so when you see me just salute

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
It's Jay Rock
Watts finest
Top Dawg Entertainment! Yeah!
When I say shit I just want the people to feel me, you feel me?

From my hometown to yours
Lead brings showers, when it rains, it pours
I'm really from the bricks, projects to be Pacific
In the spot with the pots and pans, whippin' like a chemist
I remember the day, when my momma started trippin'
Told her a hustle is all I know, I gotta make me a livin'
Pitchin' nickle and dime rocks
Bitch niggas was dissin'
Tell I got me a 9-shot, catchin' niggas slippin', flip 'em
Them was them good ol' gutter days
Sittin' im my Regal rolling big ol' blunts to blaze
Then gettin' high 'till I'm touching them clouds
A lot of shit up on my mind, is what prevent me to smile
These wicked streets, the reason my heart cold
I guess I'm just another lost soul
Which means I'm gonna search for the crossroads
Stay with my cross homes
You cross me, you're crossin' the grounds I walk on, Watts! Nigga

[Verse 3: X.O.]
You mothafuckers know what it is man
Black Wall-street up in this bitch
Yeah, X.O

I'm so inspired
Growin' through the mileage
Move through the solar system with no co-pilot
Born a mark man, God was so bias
And I swore to him I was born to be Galilee
Came from the gutter, a wild little nigga
Missin' piece to a puzzle, still trying to see the picture
2 parent home, but the hood made me smarter
Cali's full of nothin' but [?]
Maurter, may say I'm the last of the greats
Old heads seem bulimic, they need to pass the plate
I'm hip hop's bastard, I need to pass the mase
Or reverend Al just Jesse Jackson castrates
Pass the hate, plus the bullets do me
Shoot me, before you hit another young, black teen
Seems, nothin' in life is certain but death
That, and Imma always be a killer for the west
For my hometown
