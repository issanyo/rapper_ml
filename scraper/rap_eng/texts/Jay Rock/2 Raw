[Verse 1]
Hey, Groove the window down, oh, shit I'm getting high
Still I'm cool, no A/C needed
Probly sliding down ya region off this Henny got me leaning
Ain't no secret that we balling and your ho be refereeing
Bet I make that pussy whistle up and down that booty dribble
Was she foul? Just a little, tech-nical how she nibble, uhh
Ain't fucking with you losers, all my niggas won
It's Mr. BetIGotSumWeed, hey, split another one
Look down upon the ceiling
Just try to reach the sky cause when you up they all be kneeling
Contradictions in my thoughts and I just execute my feelings
Shake the nonbelievers off, I'm tryna navigate a million
But you first let's hit the store you know I love Korean
She tell me hurry up and buy, I hurry up I'm fiending
So I zip that, chop that, pass the blunt
Know my dick from last month but there's more to come, what the fuck?

[Hook]
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)
When the sunshine, and the moonlight, in my life
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)
When the sunshine, and the moonlight, in my life
Too, too fucking raw (Face down, ass up)

[Verse 2]
Heroin, extacy, Oxycontin, Vicodin
Coca Cola, everything up in our jeans
Even methamphetamines, get this bread by any means
PCP, LSD, transactions frequently
Turn you job into a ki, turn that ki into a beach
Turn that beach into ur sleep, rest ya head, remain neat
Haters love to hate a G, gossip on ya bakery
Wish they had the recipe, swear this life is meant for me
Tired of cracking niggas heads in the stolen challenger
Hopped up out the passenger and merked the DA's messenger
Every corner, camera, nigga I'm just tryna live
Shitty on a shitty curb, niggas kill ya front your kids
See how niggas get it in, trapping so we live in sin
This felony won't keep me in I'm hungry gotta rob again
Embarrassing my mom and them, grandma bragging to her friends
Killing beef, apparently, name a nigga rare as me, yeah, I be

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Got me swagged, then I put your style in a body bag
Man, I'm off a bag of that good, my flow off a powder pack
Man, I'm leaning hard, like I'm off that syrup, and I'm damn near tore up
With my dogs and locstas, and we all got stock like brokers
Ugh, we don't chase hoes, nah, hoes gon chase us, yeah
Straight to the condo, yeah, bitches ain't shit that's the mothafuckin' motto
In the Monte Carlo, yeah, sipping on Carlo, just me and my posse
Strapped up when you gotta know the ropes like Ted Dibiase
Look at my life raw, nigga, bitches wanna suck me off quicker
Haters can't stand my guts, nigga, because I get my bucks bigger
I'm on my own, I'm in my zone, bitch niggas can't knock me off my throne
I'm on my shit, cause septic tanks, I don't give a fuck what set you claim
Just get your money let the bullshit walk, I'mma get this cheese
Like a little rat bitch, fucking suck me good, nibbling through her team
Raw shit, nigga check me out, know you jocking my steez
Best believe nigga we run this shit, niggas know that I be, be
