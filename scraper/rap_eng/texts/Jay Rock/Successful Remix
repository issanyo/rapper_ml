[Verse 1]
Reporting live from the gutta
Rollin' up the kush blowin' up that bubba
Thinkin bout my life thinkin' bout my mother
How I'd give her the world if I could cause I love her
My daughter getting older I got to make it for her
Give her the things that I never had when I was younger
I know it's sad me and your momma had to part ways
Went estray cause I fell in love with this rap thing
I'm nice with it step my game up incredibly
For them fake rap ass niggas thinking they betta than me
Jay Rock you never can be somewhere under the breeze
Where the water blue as a Crip Blood dippin' a jet ski
Success breeds envy cowards willing to test me
Ridin with that choppa leaves some copper in your chest piece
Everybody's striving for the dollars and the power
That's why I'm on the grind every hour

[Hook]
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2]
My daddy got cancer he can go any day
Our relationship was rigid but heaven knows I wanna see him straight
I spit my heart out on a microphone
?? kill a track til the life is gone
And them hoes are fascinated by the glitz and glamor
I'll be damned if I blow through some millions like MC Hammer
Ridin in a Regal big slugs in a hammer
Niggas in the hood starvin better yet they famished
Better watch it when niggas bout to get in your pockets
Go get a rocket no hesitation you better pop it
You got to respect the power of a dollar
Money is everything even your partner can split your wig for change
Like a cosmetologist that's insane
Like psychological issues with your brain
I put my all into this game
I came from nothing but overcame stain
Cause I want the...

[Hook]
