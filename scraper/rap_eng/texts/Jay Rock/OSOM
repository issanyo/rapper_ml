[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, livin' life
Like I'm runnin' out of time

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Sometimes a nigga feel like
Everybody ain't real like Johnny McKinzie
If I could pretend, see I wouldn't feel right
I bought a Dodge Magnum
I just got signed, everybody on my line
They wanna know the taxes
Do Rock got a mansion? 30K to my moms
The hood turnt up, bitches, bottles, dope and all that stuff
For attention, high hopes and call my bluff
Offended by the notes when I lost love
Things change, people change, niggas change
Bitches change, friend or foe, if or so, pick a lane
Lil Wayne on my single now
Fuckin' hoes like I'm single now
Triggers close to my fingers now
But when the label frozed up, they all chosed up
They tellin' me you a non-believer now
A felony all I could think about
The cars got repoed, the bills they add up
My bitch done left me, I smoked my last one
I'm high with no sleep, I pray a bag come
I just might grab one, I just might blast one of you
Cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
But I got these wins to gain
And I don't feel comfortable
One thing that I've learnt all of these years
Is to block devils off of my ears
Cause fairytales don't end well
When the fame and fortune not here
Everybody!

[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, livin' life
Like I'm runnin' out of time

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Promethazine in a baby bottle
Meditatin' on daily dollars
Lately problems stem from my bitch
'Cause she know I still fuck with my baby mama
So there be drama in the house, I gotta find a outlet
Waitin' on a plug just like a fuckin' outlet
Fuck it, I'm turnin' my phone off
Fantasies of grabbin' the heat and burnin' my nose off
Blaow! Niggas might not know but I'm slightly throwed off
And I might need Zoloft, but for now, these Xannies'll do
Hear the sound, a manic depressive
That ain't been prescripted, what can he do?
Anywho, boy, when you got it, you keep a close watch
On the ones that's befriendin' you (friendin' you)
Them'll be the ones that's envy you (envy you)
Vividly dreamin' 'bout endin' you (endin' you)
But when you low, they don't tend to you (tend to you)
Actin' new when they run into you (into you)
Fuckin' your bitch tryna feel like you (feel like you)
This the message I send to you

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (look both ways)
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (hmmm)
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (hmmm)
Look both ways cause if you cross me, I kill ya

[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time (out of sight)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Rippin' and runnin' wild
My momma say, "Slow it down", I don't listen to her
All of my felonies on file, sippin' liquor 'til my liver ruined
My partner just lost trial
This system'll give it to you when you gettin' to it
How could you calm down?
Cause soon as your guard's down, it's a pistol to it
G-ride special, it's a Buick
I'm guilty but I said I didn't do it
Pressure bust pipes like a gunfight
I ain't never bring a knife to it
I done been through it and I been through it
All the rah-rah, I'm in a high rise
Instead of music and the interviewin'
I could be a nigga dead in a viewin'
Would you take a look inside of my eyes?
I'm surrounded by a bunch of blind guys
Out of sight and out of my mind
But y'all can never see me, checkin' chicken fettuccine
And I wish a nigga would when I'm in this Lamborghini
Top back in the bity, top down on a Bentley
Top Dawg's on the map
We familiar with your ways, we don't even need the app
Sorry but I gotta ask, you runnin' the trap or just runnin' your trap?
I'm runnin' amok, I'm runnin' it up, runnin' across the finish line
Hope you worth more than yo' Rolex
When you run up out of time

[Chorus: SiR & Jay Rock]
Out of sight, out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, feelin' like
I'm runnin' out of time, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, out of sight (out of sight)
Out of mind, livin' life
Like I'm runnin' out of time
