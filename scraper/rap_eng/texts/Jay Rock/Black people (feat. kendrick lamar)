My people don't love me
Why we hate each other?
Why we kill our brothers, why we hurt our mothers?
My people don't love me
We can love one another
We should stick together because we're all we got
My people don't love me
Why we ride on another, need to love one another
We all we got
My people don't love me
I said we all we got, I swear to God dog we all we got
My people don't love me
This whole world's spillin' senseless killing
Universe beyond evil, one topic to serve
Be my black people, we be missing the point like Shaq's freethrow
Sean Taylor, life gone because of haters
A nigga he known tried home invasion, went wrong
Bullet penetrated his leg, femur bone
Days later, wake arrangements, flowers to be catered
That was so impatient, take him from the next man
Cause he ain't got the will to hustle like he can
Niggas would rather steal than think of a righteous plan
To get residuals, kill for dividends
This life is critical, we living in a time where
9-year olds tote 9's
Turn 10, it's Mac 10's and coke lines
I wonder why successful black man gotta die from a black man
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we
Can't be a positive black role model
Leading the future with no haters to follow
Now that's fucked up, if I ever wanna see
Success, I gotta see death? Be famous for what?
He aiming for higher learning, you aiming to shoot him down
He flying straight, you wanna u-turn him
You burn your brother's bridges
His accomplishments making way for your children
Still you don't compliment, inconsiderate black pride
No never been, never win, gotta lose
That's the slope that's for the black heritage
We play the fool better than comedians
Disobediant dude no respect, ethics
I refuse to be a statistic
But changing my community don't seem realistic
Show me an African American doing right
I'll show you one that will kill his ass tonight
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we
We stuck together back in slavery days
Martin and Malcolm them dudes paved the way
The bullshit we doing, I know they're turning over in their graves
The shit need to stop today
Yeah the die for the cause, some like Jesus for us
To become better people, think about it
We used to run from the KKK
But now we running from our brothers that be holding them k's
Man, never thought there'd be days like this
Can't trust your homies that you're hanging with
Damn shame, why you kill a nigga over a chain
When you could get up on your hustle and get the same thing
United we stand tall, divided we all fall
Let's leave this bullshit behind y'all
On the real, the envy and the hate need to stop
Black people we all we got
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we
Y'all better wake up and smell the coffee
We all we got man
It's black on black killing each other man it needs to stop
Real talk
Black people need to smarten up
We all we got
