[Chorus]
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation

[Verse 1]
112th street, Deuce Line, tell a friend
Parkin' lots, dope spots, hard rock, I'ma get
Duke it out or shoot it out, fuck a opp, who was him?
Pack him out, I stall him out, we need to find out where he live
GTA's, 211s, double dutchin', MAC-11s
Section 8, welfare, EBTs on the dresser
Crash dummies, real killers, fast money, kill niggas
Blast for me, real nigga, ask for me, deal with you
Pay your fare, play it fair, here's a scale, weight it here
Kick a door, head choke, take it all, hit the stairs
Yellow bricks, peddle bricks, get an ounce, get a zip
Shotty bounce, hit his hip, make that body do a flip
I'm a vet, I'ma rep, I'm a boss, I'ma flex
I'ma turn up for the set, take this bottle to the neck
Pre-rolls for the hoes, more licks for the homies
Five hundred for the K, share it with the members only

[Chorus]
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation

[Bridge]
Pull up, pop shit, hop out, drop shit, chopstick's on me
Pull up, pop shit, hop out, drop shit, chopstick's on me

[Verse 2]
To all the real niggas, let's pledge allegiance right now
Okay, I slide by myself, I don't need no help (that's right)
Chopper on the seat, no safety belt (say what?)
I slide by myself, I don't need no help (that's right)
Chopper on the seat, no safety belt (okay now)
Get off if you mad, get off if you mad
Get off if you mad, get off if you mad
I'ma get off if I'm mad, get off if I'm mad
Get off if I'm mad, I'ma get off if I'm mad

[Chorus]
I got the drank, I got the smoke in rotation
Head on a swivel, rotation
I got the backdoor swingin', rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
If it's war, double back and rotation
