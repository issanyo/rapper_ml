[Intro]
Dear God, I wanna thank you for this big redemption
Dear God, I wanna thank you for this bad bitch I got on my side
Dear God, I wanna thank you for letting me be a real nigga
Dear God, I wanna thank you for giving me a second chance
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Dear God, I wanna thank you for all these dollars and gold

[Chorus]
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch, knock it off (where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch, knock it off (where the cash at?)

[Verse 1]
Eastside Johnny on one, ain't no question what it is
2-2-3, I'll let you hold one if you come between my ends
I done slide in through the streets, I done slide in through the pen
Politickin' on the yard, drop your ass off a tier
I don't trust nobody, but my daughter and my shotty
If it blasts, that's a bag, if he live, for the body
2-door seats, you know me, windows tinted so the law don't see
I like top when she all on me, panties drop when they call on me
Skin-tight fade with the red Cortez
Clip ain't in but it's one in the head
Girl don't play with it, heard what I said?
Girl don't play with it, heard what I said?
Ain't no stains upon my suede, I been high for like 4 days
On the vibe for like 4 days, catchin' fades and runnin' plays
Goddamn

[Chorus]
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch, knock it off (where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch, knock it off (where the cash at?)

[Verse 2]
I'm on 10, I go in, I just pop, I just win
Off the lot, in a win, I am Rock, who is him?
Fuck you doin'? Get a bag, sellin' work in a lab
Smokin' purp in a Lamb, pull up, skrrrt! 'Rari, fast
Off the porch, tendencies, two for one, ten a piece
Fuck the ones takin' beans, add two, twelve deceased
Pour one up for Stephen Clark, then jump in and push the start
If I say this caviar, nigga, I ain't mad at y'all, goddamn

[Chorus]
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch, knock it off (where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
Top off, drop off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, nigga, knock it off (where the cash at?)
You ain't me, bitch, knock it off (where the cash at?)
