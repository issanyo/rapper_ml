[Verse 1]
I'm Jay muthafuckin' Rock nigga, what it do?
All red chucks yellin' out "SU-WOOP!"
Known by them niggas that be wearin' all blue
That's why I get a pass everytime I ride through
Eastside bounty hunter Watts that's my clique
Nickerson Gardens, nigga you know the bricks
Nine double 0 five nine you know the zip
Top Dawg light it up we just gave 'em another hit

[Hook]
Cause I'm a blood nigga, red rag until I die
See the brims, see the RU's yeah you know we certified
I'm a blood nigga, damu's on the ride
Flamed up across the globe, yeah you know we worldwide
I'm a blood nigga, when you see me better give it up
None but a B thang, homie we don't give a fuck
I'm a blood nigga, haters tryna shut us out the door
Get yo walk on but I'mma keep it blood tho

[Verse 2]
I'm a blood nigga, all red bandana
With my Juelz on but I'm not Santana
I'm a blood nigga, just bicking back being bool
Cut off khakis, braids and house shoes
I'm a blood nigga, heavy thang to my right
Can't correct me when I'm wrong, when I'm wrong, blood I'm right
I'm a blood nigga, I'm the realest nothin' nice
When it's beef then it's on, I'm takin' off right on sight

[Hook]
