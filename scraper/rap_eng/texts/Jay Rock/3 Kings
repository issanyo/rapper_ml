[Hook]

Niggas talking shit when we step up in the club
It's all good 'till you get hit with a slug
Yeah he on the wall, coughing up blood
Should have known not to fuck with us thugs
Catch me in the hood, blowing on bud
Nigga, fuck your dollar man, I'm all about dubs
Catch me in the kitchen, cooking up drugs
[?] I'm all for the bubs

[Verse 1]
I'm all over the stove like pots and pans
Hit the corner with the rock, the Glocks in hand
Rock hold more shells than a taco stand
If I pop, the block hot like a summer jam
Damn, I won't hesitate, to let the pistol whistle
Bullets like many missiles, go straight through your tissue
And your momma yelling, crying sneeze into some tissue
I'm like, damn Rock, you could have worked out the issue
Really hard in the club  without no bodyguards
This where OGs fresh out the penitentiary are
For those who don't know me don't pretend you're hard
Yeah that loud talking shit, that'll get you scarred
Left hook, knock your punk ass on your back
Your head busted, now it looks like the crack of her ass
Then I'm back posting up on the ave
With the homies smoking and joking, counting that cash

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm like a sound system bump base on the block
Niggas scheming, bulletproof doors on the drop
Well I ain't got a garage, '64 in the lot
In the city of god when they bust at the cops
I stay with a fed, always keep me a bitch
Always holding a crip, always keep me a clip
Yeah, these niggas like  to trip, I'll send them to their destination
To that hot place, you can talk it out with Satan
I'm hot faced, I was blessed with raw game
Bitches fiending for my dick, call me cocaine
In the hood, like tall cans and low daddies
I'm so so gutta like ghetto swords and [?] alleys
I'm from CA, but some call it killer Cali
Where we banging, get some bitches don't know who their [?] is
Twist up dro, laid back like recliners
Smoking on five, got me higher than airliners

[Hook]

[Outro]

Yeah it's Jay Rock niggas
Straight out the projects, Nickerson Gardens
DeeJay Dave, I see you my nigga
Fat Boy I see you my nigga
That's how we do it here
