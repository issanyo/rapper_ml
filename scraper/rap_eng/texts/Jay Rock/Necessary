[Intro]
90059 be the zip, it be the zip
90059 be the zip, it be the zip, it be the zip
90059 be the zip, it be the zip
90059 be the zip, it be the zip
90059 be the zip, it be the zip
90059 be the zip

[Verse 1]
I'm straight up out that East side, swinging like zip lines
On Forgiato rim tire, automatic spit fire
'Gnac in a black canister, look at this bastard go
It don't take much to aim, fingers be snatchin' souls
Out on my grind, rhymin', stacking this cash to hold
And I could take you where them niggas get bodied
But that ain't nobody business, so what the fuck is you asking for?
Look, I'm just tryna blow good dope
And put my feet to the metal in life to see just how fast it goes
Fuck the world, gotta make that bitch grab her toes
And Rock game never goofy, no weapon shall prosper
Maneuver like I'm Bruce Lee, ya know I'm chucks
Been doing this since a young buck
Banging for fifty cent from a victim, while my gun tucked
And somebody gotta get it
And when you make a dollar, know somebody gotta spend it

[Pre-Hook]
The struggle is real, the struggle is real, the struggle is real
You gotta do what you got to just to get over the hill
When you live in America, either kill or be killed, yo

[Hook]
Lord have mercy, have mercy
I know I ain't living right and know I'm not perfect
But plus I gotta eat what I'm doing it's worth it
So, Lord have mercy

[Verse 2]
I stay at your head or be at your throat
Better ask your folk, I'm never the dawg to provoke
Niggas know the status and bitches come cast they votes
In my zone with coke and plenty of grass to smoke
I'm surpassin' broke, stay trapping for mo'
Two chicks boosting, we hooking back up in the back of the sto'
I'm the jack of many trades, steady pimping my pen
Hustle in the shade, respond  in a nigga's funny ways
I was raised by winners
Niggas who park Benzs up at that Staples Center
Now that gangsta nigga, I'm on some new money
Nothing but raw, pop shit, catch one in the jaw
It's gutta law, I know, you wish you was a star
What I do is internal, smoking herbal
Try'na run up in some bitches who fertile, woah
Feel like this is my moment, feel it's time for change
Exercise some game, niggas vibe done changed
No looking back at it, cause this is that moment
I step forward ready to go at each and every opponent
Give it to anybody that want it
Represent the underdog, training in the gym
Till the minute they get they number called
I'm speed bagging this work, the trainers see me smashing
With perspiration on the back of my shirt, making them sweat
Better yet, just look at them vexed
Like when I’m in that NiX, cashing a check
You know it’s real nigga

[Pre-Hook]
The struggle is real, the struggle is real, the struggle is real
You gotta do what you got to just to get over the hill
When you live in America, either kill or be killed, yo

[Hook]
Lord have mercy, have mercy
I know I ain't living right and know I'm not perfect
But plus I gotta eat what I'm doing it's worth it
So, Lord have mercy
