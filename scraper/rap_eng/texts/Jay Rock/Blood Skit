Hood rich bitch

[American Newscaster (British Newscaster)]
Now this red hat right here would be for a blood gang
The W stands for westside Pirus
Even though its a baseball hat the Washington Nationals
They wear it because its red for the bloods
And the W for westside Pirus
If you look closely you can see this is a um
A bunch of bloods at a funeral
And if you look close, the mother is holding the B sign
And its upside down but its normally like this for Piru
(And she's throwing that sign over her son's coffin)
