[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I'm never asleep I'm on my shit dawg
Like a toddler in a craddle with a pamper on
Niggas see me and I know they plot I know the plot
They wanna see you close when you open shop
That's why I walk with the fifth when I'm on the block don't trip
'Cuz If you do there's repercussions that's when you look over your shoulders and the reaper coming
God got some more of your people coming
Just keep them gates open I'mma keep 'em coming
They say life's a gamble and if you play I'mma rip your poker hand to shambles

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Sometime I roll the streets go low but don't trip my nigga (Don't trip my nigga)
And I don't care if you Ese if you Blood or you Crip my nigga (It don't matter my nigga)
Don't ever think you ain't subject to get get your wig split my nigga (It can happen my nigga)
Don't trip my nigga (don't trip keep it cool my nigga) My nigga

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Pssh just riding under the moonlight something illegal in the trunk not moonshine
But never mind that I got sidetracked got it down to a science like Sci-Fi
I can see them coming in my hindsight
Easy money fools paradise I roll with it like a fool with a pair of dice
Cold with it like a pack of ice
Lay you frozen on the ground like a snow angel no fable
They say life's a gamble I'll noodle your ass like a can of Campbells

[Hook]
Sometime I roll the streets go low but don't trip my nigga (Don't trip my nigga)
And I don't care if you Ese if you Blood or you Crip my nigga (It don't matter my nigga)
Don't ever think you ain't subject to get get your wig split my nigga (It can happen my nigga)
Don't trip my nigga (don't trip keep it cool my nigga) My nigga

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Some niggas shoot craps some niggas blackjack
But me I'm in the kitchen with the flapjacks whip it flip it to get stacks back
Whatever the fiends need I has that
But see with that comes the hassle
The posse tryna overthrow your castle
Niggas you trained to be soldiers
Strategizing on how to take you to battle
Now that's a fucked up situation
Got you patiently waiting for the infiltration
So if you gamble with your life if it ain't for the money do it for the right price

[Hook]
Sometime I roll the streets go low but don't trip my nigga (Don't trip my nigga)
And I don't care if you Ese if you Blood or you Crip my nigga (It don't matter my nigga)
Don't ever think you ain't subject to get get your wig split my nigga (It can happen my nigga)
Don't trip my nigga (don't trip keep it cool my nigga) My nigga

[Outro: Jay Rock]
Don't trip my nigga
It don't matter my nigga
It can happen my nigga
Don't trip keep it cool my nigga
