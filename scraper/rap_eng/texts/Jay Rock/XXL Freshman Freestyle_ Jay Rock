I'm a lyrical disease infested MC
Bring your best three, I eat 'em like nookie and give 'em hysterectomies
It's my destiny to bring a plague to ya
Feel the rage of a fire breathin' reptilian
With a red rag in my right pocket
Aiming at civilians if they plan to watch it
Fry your optics with frightening objects under surveillance of federal agents
Catastrophic as breakfast with Satan, Hell be waitin'
