[Chorus: ORI]
Worth it?
Maybe when you go home
I don't wanna be here
Try not to think about it
Is it worth it?
Maybe, when you go home
I don't wanna be here
Try not to think about it
Is it?

[Verse 1: Jay Rock & ORI]
Tryna solve my problems off this fifth of Henny
How many fucks to give, lately, I'm running empty
Struggle with who I am and who I wanna be
Got the streets and these beats right in front of me
Should I kill this nigga or should I let him slide?
If I don't, he double back, we got family ties?
If I do, I can't rap, and that's suicide
'Cause niggas tellin', turn you to felons, twenty-five
I can't have my babies walkin' around in projects
While I'm on my bunk stressin' through the process
I'd rather be a prospect, you know, God-like
But for now, many Tec's, this is my life (is it?)
Should I kill this nigga or should I let him by?
My momma say I'm like my daddy, I got too much pride
And she was right, mix this bottle with the lime and Sprite
Hit the lights, yeah, somebody gotta die tonight

[Chorus: ORI]
Is it worth it?
Maybe when you go home
I don't wanna be here
Try not to think about it
Is it worth it?
Maybe when you go home
I don't wanna be here
Try not to think about it
Is it?

[Verse 2: Jay Rock and ORI]
They say money's the root of all evil
I say the power of pussy'll scar people
That pretty flower'll spoil you, then it poison you
You get amnesia to everything you was loyal to
I wanna fuck this little bitch, but I know she bogus
Credit cards, profiles, bank's always open
And if I smash, do the dash, that's hocus pocus
She 'bout cash, I ain't mad, I'm just not devoted
To fall in love with, doin' exotic drugs
And playin' inside of clubs, I'm never the one to cuff
She like, "Johnny, you know this pussy yours and only yours
Take the rubber off, there's more passion you could explore"
(Is it worth it?) If she see me on TV tellin' the girls about me
And all she saw was a Benz and thought the world about me
She think her nigga a lick and I got rapper money
And child support is the legal way she can ask for money

[Chorus: ORI]
Is it worth it?
Maybe when you go home
I don't wanna be here
Try not to think about it
Is it worth it?
Maybe when you go home
I don't wanna be here
Try not to think about it
Is it?
