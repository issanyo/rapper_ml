The following is a DJ Skee presentation

Any of y'all know Jimmy Johnson?
(Hey man you better have an invite walkin' on this turf)
Listen up man, I'm OG Bobby Johnson
(You're killer Bobby Johnson? You Jay Rock daddy?)
That's right, Jay Rock broke out of jail last night
And I'm lookin' for him and I need some help
(Sure you ride, you gonna ride down on Willy Manchester?)
Course I am, but I need Jay Rock, you know where he at?
(he at [?])

You already know who it is man the king of the West Coast
DJ Skee, and I was on my way down to Watts
To thank my man Jay Rock for killin' it in my car show this year
Cause you know it sold out
You know he started playing me this music
And said I had to be a part of it man
So here it is Watts Finest Volume 2
