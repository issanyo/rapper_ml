[Verse 1: Mozzy]
I had to grind, had a lot of money on my mind
Started off with a drawer full of dimes
Started lookin' for love, it was hard for me to find
Bitches tell me they love me, I never believe them lies
These niggas tell me they love me, I never believe them lies
I promise if you my brother, then I just want you to shine
Yeah, I done put it all on the line behind Moz
And I couldn't stop cryin', my little nigga died
Took a couple trips and yeah, you want me to slide
You know what its behind, we ain't worried about the time (yeah)
Suckas on my line, ain't nowhere for me to hide
I been picking up bags, location on the fly
Judge bringin' up priors, legal phone got me lookin' tired
And the drive here at least 5 hours, top shelf dope, I ain't smokin' nothin' sour
Nowadays, need a money counter, just to count a couple hundred thousand

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
It ain't a game like Nintendo
Gotta watch how you movin' on them ten toes
Nothin' is by the book, niggas switchin' up
Snitchin' becomin' bool, niggas bitchin' up
Him and his enemigos, yeah they cliquin' up
On the 'Gram now, and you ain't knowin' what is what
All this hoe shit at an all-time high
They only tend to love you when yo' ass (mhmm)
I ain't gotta speak on it, you got a brain
If the shoe fit, wear that bitch
Situation's dirty, then you clean up quick
One mop, two cans, on some aerosol shit
We just tryna eat, checkin' chicken like I'm Farmer John
Mister all kinda knick-knacks, pick you one
Look, my vibe on the scale yeah, weigh it up
Call me thirty-six, get yo' wages up

[Outro: Dcmbr]
'Cause on the way up, nobody asked for me
But on the way down, is what they all wanna see
That's where they want me to be
Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows
What it took to stay ten toes down
Nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows
Where I been, thank the Lord I made it out
Nobody knows
