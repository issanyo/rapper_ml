[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, I booked you a flight
We headed to that Westside
I got that all red Bentley for us when we arrive
So, baby girl, let's ride
Girl, I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang 'cause we gon' do it all night, yeah

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
What it do, look, roll out that red carpet, watch how them girls stalk me
Ladies I smash often, my bed they valet parkin'
They like how I be saucy, I'm fresh to death, bitch
I ain’t a millionaire yet, but I’m hood rich
I got that Kush shit, I’m talkin' gutta gutta
I got that wood stick, she got that butta butta
That body lookin' yummy, yeah, that ass talkin'
Sexy her swag awesome, Jimmy Choos, bag, flossin'
Up in the club stuntin', sippin' that Nuvo
Lemon head, look at my chains shinin' like chandeliers
Where my pretty girls at? Sexy face, ass fat
Hotel poppin' after hours, I’ma smash that
Call me daddy fat stacks, pockets on swole
Nothin' less than hundred on the Kush when I smoke
Baby, wanna roll, tell me what it do
'Cause a playa turned up, I reserved a room for two, look

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, I booked you a flight
We headed to that Westside
I got that all red Bentley for us when we arrive
So, baby girl, let's ride
Girl, I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang 'cause we gon' do it all night, yeah

[Verse 2: Jay Rock & (Chris Brown)]
Now they lovin' how I be killin' 'em, haters say I’m dead wrong (oh)
Lookin' for a red bone, big booty head strong (oh)
Hopin' I can take her home, satisfaction guaranteed (oh, woah)
Dr. Feel Good, got yo baby mama callin' me (yeah)
I be workin' in them sheets, 80 due, heavy plumbin' (oh)
All night, long bang, bang, like a lone drummer (yeah, yeah)
We rush bottles to that VIP, T.D.E (yeah)
We in the buildin', ladies go crazy, A.D.D (yeah)
That’s what we do, so what it do? Baby, what it's lookin' like?
Love my liquor brown, mix it with a little Sprite
That's gon' get me right, lookin' for my friend tonight (oh, oh, oh)
Sweet tooth, performin' the placard pieces, my appetite
She like entertainers, so she gon' entertain us (yeah)
Dip it low, stripper pose, dollars at her ankles (yeah)
Everythin' is paid for, put that on my tab
I put that on me and I got it on smash

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby girl, I booked you a flight
Yeah, we headed to that Westside
I got that all red Bentley for us when we arrive
So, baby girl, let's ride (I do it, I do it, I do it, I do it)
Girl, I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang (I'll have you screaming out)
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can’t wait to get you home to bang bang 'cause we gon' do it all night, yeah
'Cause we headed to that Westside, oh, oh
