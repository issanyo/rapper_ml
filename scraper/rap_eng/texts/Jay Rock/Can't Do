[Verse 1 - Schoolboy Q]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit was all bad just a week ago, yeah
Woke up the next morning I was on they can't slow it down now
Where we going next? Sky high
Through the cloud Hiii power tell them book a jet
Quick if you know what's best about to make you lose your breath
And I'm standing on your chest and I ain't lettin' up
I ain't trying to let you eat and I ain't trying to wish you luck
You should probably try to get a billy share what you ain't enough
See you gotta understand I'm the motherfucking man, yeah
You're always at the bottom that's the motherfucking plan, yeah
Record after record, keep my name up in demand
I ain't trying to be a friend, I ain't trying to shake your hand
You niggas know what's up but lemme break it down G
Had that oxycontin popping all around your town B
Talking plane after plane, mean [?]
Touch down receiving now will fuck it, I run it back, back

[Hook - Schoolboy Q]
My nigga's flammable, we all on fire, we all on fire
My nigga's flammable, we all on fire, we all on fire
Tell me what you can but I tell you what you can't do
Touch a hundred grand well that's something what you can't do
Say up in the man well that's something what you can't do
Another hundred grand well that's something that you can't do
I tell what you can do

[Verse 2 - Schoolboy Q]
Fuck with any nigga in my circle
You square? Swear, you don't compare, get your shit repaired
Burn up out my underwear, bitch, I dropped thirty on ‘em, Kobe LeBronin em
Gripping my balls I'm palmin' them, feeling myself, move around but I'm rewinding them
Talky mouth, we pounding them, media ripped in 3 in your clamydia burning, you should've learned your lesson
Why would you play with fire, you and your crew can get expired
Nigga you're tired, go to sleep, got his ass seran wrapped, yeah
Lyrical shraps beating black and blue, you nincompoop, 007, Glock in my suit
Orange top, orange Chucks, pockets Hooved up, twist up, pulled up some screaming we show
We show the promoter too
Still do what I came to do, bottle after bottle like I got in advance
Went from shittin' in cans to threesomes in sedans, it's part of my plan, the moment I feel like I made it
Getting half the bitches that said I was over rated
Now I'm the latest, call me the greatest, one of her favorites, I raised her
She say we famous, this rappin' be do or die, there’s a difference between you and I
Fuck a unity, truancy, bitch, never here when we was workin' hard but won an applaud, stunt a nigga that take care of you, should have been abroad
We brought your pussy now bow down to the greats, the hardest and human race
Don't make me humiliate, yeah, yeah, yeah
And put the names out there you best have clear, you're pressed out here
Slide me the weapon, pop your recession, your valuable lesson

[Hook - Schoolboy Q]
My nigga's flammable, we all on fire, we all on fire
My nigga's flammable, we all on fire, we all on fire
Tell me what you can but I tell you what you can't do
Touch a hundred grand well that's something what you can't do
Say up in the man well that's something what you can't do
Another hundred grand well that's something that you can't do
I tell what you can do

[Verse 3 - Jay Rock]
Clash with these titans, burners without license
See them B's and them H's, that’s priceless
Q told me, ‘Go brazy’ and brazy, that’s my shit
I’m the shit’, she tell me, sippin' Hennessy with your bitch
Now she say baby be going crazy for the dick, wow
King Kong knock them down, back to back, ping pong
Fast lane, fast money, you for the fame you crash dummy
Niggas get beside theyselves, steppin' outside theyselves
Tell them get a reality check they say rock is the best
The shit that smoke the some in the pipe, I'm worser than that
More like a nuclear bomb in the trap, Saddam in the flesh
The effect is like dominos, when we drop niggers falling like Geronimo
Let ‘em suffer, we bring the ruckus, flow funky like the shit on the shingle
Got your numbers if you yelling bingo
On fire like skillets in Hell’s Kitchen, get your jewels missing for starting backwards
12 gauge pump action, we smashing in grand nationals kill capital collateral damages
Overcome challenges, digging your bitch they gonna toss that hoe to my managers
We're scandalous

[Hook - Schoolboy Q]
My nigga's flammable, we all on fire, we all on fire
My nigga's flammable, we all on fire, we all on fire
Tell me what you can but I tell you what you can't do
Touch a hundred grand well that's something what you can't do
Say up in the man well that's something what you can't do
Another hundred grand well that's something that you can't do
I tell what you can do

[Outro - Schoolboy Q]
Nigga I tell you what you can do nigga
You can't be for my power nigga, go home nigga
Work on that week ass mix tape, we sellin' mix tapes, yeah
You can't do it nigga, TDE!
