[Hook 1]
More money to blow then I'm good to go
More kush and a smoke then I'm good to go
She drop that ass on the floor she good to go
Stop playin' with me tell me what its hittin' for

[Verse 1]
We can leave right now tell me if you good to go
You're friend can come too tell me if she good to go
That coconut Ciroc in me I'm good to go
Stop playin' with me tell me what its hittin' for
Boomerang boomerang, sadiddy or ratchet
If she throw it back best believe I'm gonna catch it
1800 or that coconut Ciroc she gon' sip it till its gone
Just to make them panties drop now you you and her
Come back to my room room and work
I'm talkin' 'bout calisthenics cardio paramedics at the door
I done killed it two times you can keep them coupons
I don't ever save 'em I just like own 'em a lot
Here's your ultimatum leave him and come back to my spot
Do you got that boomerang tell me if it's too insane
Pop two of these ima lay back while you do your thang

[Hook 2]
She sip her drink slow then she good to go
Mix it with some 'dro then she good to go
She put that ass on the floor she good to go
Stop playin' with me tell me what its hittin' for

Boomerang she keep 'em comin' back she keep 'em comin' back
She keep 'em comin' back she go that
Boomerang she keep 'em comin' back she keep 'em comin' back
She keep 'em comin' back she got that

[Verse 2]
Ahhhh
She keep 'em comin back like a re-run
If you pay for her you don't need no refund
She got that wet wet I'm talkin' Niagra Falls
I can swim in it I'm on my boogie board
I'm talkin 1 o'clock 2 o'clock all night madness
3 o'clock 4 o'clock and she still at it
Im fiending like an addict because she got that snapper
Good good candy sweet put it in a wrapper
She lookin' at a rapper I tell her that I'm Jay Rock tho
After party bad bitches follow everywhere I go
That's the only way I know losin' not an option
Now get that ass on the floor right now and get it poppin' like
