DJ Skee Exclusive

[Verse 1: Maximo]
Gimme all the pesos
Case closed
38 Slug nose
Leaning out the window of a white Rolls
Niggas keep speaking on my name like ads
I give 'em no action
Puff puff keep passing
Get rid of these niggas
I really don't need em
Seeing visions of my lying unconscious not breathing
They see me towing a weapon as big as a [?]
If yo bitch coming with me then she digging a [?]
But don't act like my killers ain't creeping
Don't act like we still ain't beefing
Cause what comes along might be just too much to swallow
Like all that blood from choking off hollows
Peace never show none
Love never got none
Niggas talk about guns like I ain't got none
9 milli auto, black like afros
They say that nigga strapped with his gun in his hoodie
Nigga relax

[Hook]
Jay Rock:
That's not gangsta
It's not raw and uncut
Look nigga shut the fuck up
This is gangsta
Big guns big guts
Squeezing off rounds with the dutch
Maximo:
That's not gangsta
It's not raw and uncut
Look nigga shut the fuck up
This is gangsta
Big balls big nuts
Squeezing off rounds with the dutch

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
On the road got a pack of arsenal
Niggas will play you close when you setting up shop like a carnival
Rock hustle hard for the bundles
Fuck with the kid AR leave your head like a tunnel
A lot of niggas out there claiming their G's
Niggas please you would die for no B's and C's
Pull up on the block in a drop six
Pop six fill yo ass up with that hot shit
Watch this
This ain't no movie ain't [?] as a smokescreen
When niggas doing bad they'll jump to the next team
Backstabbers, cold bastards
I don't talk a lot
I let the gat do all of the chit chatter
Get mad get buff like Bruce Banner
Put a bullet to your head make you die faster
Call me OJ bitch nigga I'll stab ya
Send you to heaven quick call my gat pastor

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Jay Rock:
I needed some change so I flipped the pitch [?]
I needed a name for stripes I took fades
Time is short so I cherish the good days
If I'm Blood for life I hope I make it to old age
Carry a vest homie believe what I say
The bullets is serious
Yeah they don't play
Fuck a pistol
Gotta carry an AK
In the concrete jungle it seems we the prey
Maximo:
Harsh reality [?] like a sun
Until that ass get gunned down with the steel
I start to smoke something
She pullin on my dick like more frontin'
Home I don't owe nothing
I'm in the corner with the crew daddy
Run if you mad at me
[?]
Take a jab at me
[?] Just another player that I know
Come through and smoke me out like the system

[Hook]
