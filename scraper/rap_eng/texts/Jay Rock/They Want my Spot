[Intro]
Yeah, Bâ€”these niggas want my spot, dog
These niggas can't have it, though, look
Check it out, though, look

[Verse 1]
A lot of hating going on around these parts
Soon as you get some money then the bullshit starts
Yea, you get them funds then yo enemy's come
Another Watts star rapper I ant finna be one
They want to see a nigga fall off, give up, then quit it
Hell naw my nigga shits gettin realer
And I came to far to throw it away
That's what you want me to do, you wanna take my place
But, first things first you can't walk in my shoes
And the second thing is you ain't keeping it true
I know niggas ain't my friends I'm feeling the vibe
Talk about me when I'm gone, tellin em lies
My daddy told me I was gone feel this shit
But I never seen it coming it's how real it gets
Niggas actin like hoes, female dogs and it's killing them slow when the see me ball
Continue to go hard, and crush these mics, and fuck all them haters who want this light
Can't have.. Can't have it... Nah
These niggas yea want my spot

[Chorus]
I dun came true
In this life I live
Push me to the limit
But I will never quit i5
(They want my spot)

[Verse 2]
This rap business is a motherfucker
It's hard to socialize when you surrounded by fake motherfuckers
Through the mist of it all I gotta stay focused
Because the moment I slip up my spot's open
Yea niggas wanna keep me down
I'm on the rise like yeast, I gotta feed my child
And I know you niggas jealous I can see y'all smiles
Turn my back in my eyesight I see y'all frowns
Uh, it gets ugly on the road to riches
You see them storms coming and the path get rugged
Niggas pretending they love you but they eyes on your budget
These lames want my spot motherfucker I ain't budging
Ain't your average rap goon, some niggas is clowns
Rock good in any hood you can check my file
Only the real niggas understand my style
That's why their ears to the speaker homie hear me out

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
These haters second string
They mad 'cause I'm fuckin bad bitches with ass
Pussy sweet as a nectarine
Been bagging hoes before I had flow
I been gettin pussy before I had dough
16 in the spot with D
It all started from a rock then I copped the key
Then I dropped outta school like it wasn't for me
Gangbangin getting money was my drive you see
Pull up in something for your eyes to be
Niggas dispising me, behind bars all this rave was the eyes for me
But I emerged from the flames hit the studios paying lyrical slugs at your brain
Gotta understand it's the life I live
Still in the bricks with the project kids
Reminiscing pushing each other in coasters
Now we in the streets whippin them Testarossas

Nigga

[Chorus]
