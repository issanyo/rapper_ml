[Hook]
They think I’m doing this just for fun
I’m going in, I wanna be number one
Two’s a bad look and one I want
I’m such a G, I wanna be number one
They think I’m doing this just for fun
I’m going in, I wanna be number one
Two’s a bad look and one I want
I’m such a G, I wanna be number one

[Verse 1: Laws]
Ay, I don’t want the responsibility
I’m saving a dying culture from all the philistines
And still it seems I'mma have to be the party stopper
They say that once you in the zone, then it’s hard to stop
I'mma A class, ahead of my peers
I’m near the next weight class, I’m aiming for them harder boxers
I used to live in debt, now I resurrect the game
Till we all the living dead, deadly as a cigarette
Smoking while the Nicorette's poking out ya shirt sleeve
These are my trophies, I deserve these
I bet my life savings if you heard me before your current favorite rapper
You diss ‘em and then encourage me
Despite my proper way of speaking, I’m feeling prejudice currently
‘Cause Laws Brown like Murphy so I gotta be number one off my etiquette
Parade with confetti through the land of the confederates

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Look, I’m number one, zero don’t count
Dracula when I bite into this bitch, you see the blood come
I’m on one, you wack rappers y'all on two
Yeah motherfucker I said it so what you gon’ do?
My city, I’m the one in the town
I’m the king, matter of fact, I’m loving the crown
Nigga, it's Top Dawg, we the best is the pound
West Coast motherfucker, know you loving the sound
Now number one that I am, hit your town
Take your bitch down up in the Hyatt
You see some ranches, know that I pull my bulls out
Keep heavy metal like Uncle Jesse off Full House
A train on tracks, heavy on fire, I’m too dope for y’all so don’t try it
I ain’t the one to be dissing, if I’m the one that you dissing
You gonna be missing with them vicious, nigga I’m the one

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Laws]
I want my mama watching TV and seeing me dressed up
Living out my dreams, looking so clean in my pressed tux
And to make it happen, I’ll keep on beating the rest up
Overeating like I’m dreaming of being the next Pun
Or is it the first Laws rather be a trendsetter
Thinking you a boss ‘cause you people steady spend cheddar
The way you fake cats steady put on an act
I'mma have to put on a mask and be rap’s V for Vendetta
You so scary that you scare me to sleep
My voice high, making any comparisons is weak
The second after I drop, I hope your carelessness will cease
‘Cause you’ll have to run it back and start comparing them to me
I wonder if you got a fan that’s not inebriated
I’m the best period, your plans just got abbreviated
For anybody that does not know me as Laws
You can call me Simon ‘cause your song and dance is not appreciated
