[Verse 1: B-Mac]
Aye, let's take it back to them days
We was drinking water with sugar, no lemonade
Posted on the corner no longer being afraid
Me and little cousin have visions of getting paid
But he's gone, my momma told him "Get a phone
And that's for a ride, you don't need to be walking home"
And there goes the pride of a boy in a broken home
Shot seven times and at times I feel alone
Baby brother breathing, he living the rolling stone
Sis staying strong she keeping this in control
Mommy with a man but she wasn't ready to go
When I see her not breathing I'm screaming telling her "No!"
I know she still waiting to see her baby girl blow
Cause every time I'm flowing I'm feeling her in my soul
And this is dedication for the two
Top down while I cruise keep it going, continue to make moves

[Hook]
I wish I could make the pain go away
So I pray let everything be okay
Let's just (groove)
Let's just
Let's just
I know we all struggle so we hustle
Just remember and trust that God loves you
Let's just (groove)
Let's just
Let's just groove

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
See I could just get off some sad sHit
But I ratHer give you tHe real spit
See life is tHick in tHe Hood so I lost weigHt
Cross state riding tHrougH anotHer town witH tHe false rental plates
Sprinkle rigHt over tHe bladder like funnel cakes
Feel great HuH? Die witH tHe bad brakes
Hop out lookin' fly tHan a motHerfucker
Last real nigga alive, yeaH I'm tHe motHerfucker
I tHougHt I told you I'm tHe Hottest
Guaranteed to sHine, left tHe wHole game polisHed
Turn it up some notcHes tHen send it to tHe doctors
Basically I'm super ill, dizzing of a couple pills
I put tHat on my motHer's only son
Hop out, spray tHe crowd, I'm tHe only one
Hoover Crip style still [?]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Look, I started from the project post selling rocks
Now a the project Pope
White city why we suppose to kill for our colour
It's nothing but halo tips and politics
So acknowledge it
I smoke kush for the funk of it
See my girlfriend with the homie
Nigga fuck a bitch
Why? On a whole another level
Look, am on fire like am walking with the devil
Am grimey but I got my angels behind me
You eyeing me shots to your dome
Sleep comedy I know the haters wanna see me in a box
Coz am paid never slippin [?]
Got yay,see the Jay Rock whipping in the pot
Got game you know my nigga balling on the block
Like a sinner no it don't stop
You can tell all the haters they can catch me on Top Dawg
