[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Now
I've be on the block with my niggas
Rollin swishers, sippin' liquor
I can paint you a picture
Picture me richer
Look at my business
Watch my niggas
Pledgin' allegiance
My team eatin'
Roll through the hood
Kids at the lights
Oh no, I'm not a guy
Gettin' money
That's the job
Feedin' my family
All them haters, they mad at me
If they tryin' to keep, Imma put them to sleep
Permanently
Imma squeeze
Broke niggas, they analysing
Bitches, they fantasising
My empire on the rise
Real nigga, just look in my eyes
You see the struggle
Got your life in the palm of my hand
Don't need no muscle
Bullets, they bust heads
Whatcha thinkin' bout?
Rocks and more bread
Duckin', dodgin' the feds
Gettin' money, makin' moves
By the dollar, what it do
If you ainÂ´t bout no money
Then I ain't fuckin' with you

[Hook]
Gettin' money, makin' moves [x2]
If you bout the dollar
Imma holla what it do
Got the work that you need
Holla if you want it
Bust it down
I bet you see some profit off the corner
Gettin' money, makin' moves [x2]
If you bout the dollar
Imma holla what it do
If you ain't makin' no money
Then I ain't fuckin' with you
That's the rules to the streets
Get your money, make your moves

[Verse 2]
Now
Look
I hit a button
Now the roof gone
Convertible coupe
Paint color, two tone
She know whassup when I'm showin' up
Menage with bad bitches, now i'm foreigners
I kill 'em everytime
Bring the coroners
Touch my family
Then I'm killin' you without warnin' yo
I'm a warrior
Marchin' like a spartan
Yet I'm still I'm feelin' victorious
Look down my corridor
Look at the palace
This the shit niggas killin' for
Got this rabid shit in the [?]
Don't get it twisted like some cornrows
There's no survivin'
Niggas die when them guns blow
Get rich or die broke
When the first load gonna see Diablo
I gotta get it my nigga
Is for survival
Gettin' money, makin' moves
If you ain't makin' no money
Then I ain't fuckin' with you

[Hook]

Don't even worry bout that
I got it

[Verse 3: Juice McCain]
I'm on that hundred stack
Come up homie, what it do
I got a son to feed
And I got a daughter too
Calculatin' moves from above
While playin' this card
I've got the hustle of a king
Soul of a god
Nickel plated hyper
Fourth fifther
Straight liquor
Come between me and the money
That's when I erase a nigga
Picture on the corner to the lights off
No nights off
I can give it to you hard
Or that white soft
I'm in the paper makin'
I'm not paper chasin'
That's the quickest way your minds can meet past the mason
I've never step for sucker niggas and pussy way
I double the money, stack a few and keep the change
It's not the hood rhymin'
It's the hood timin'
The new range, the new chain
With Maroon diamonds
Get your money, make your moves
If you ain't gettin' money
I ain't fuckin with you
What it do

[Hook]
Gettin' money, makin' moves [x2]
If you bout the dollar
Imma holla what it do
Got the work that you need
Holla if you want it
Bust it down
I bet you see some profit off the corner
Gettin' money, makin' moves
Gettin' money, makin' moves
If you bout the dollar
Imma holla what it do
If you ain't makin' no money
Then I ain't fuckin' with you
That's the rules to the streets
Get your money, make your moves
