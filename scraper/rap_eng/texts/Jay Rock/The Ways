[Intro]
Wait, I understand the love, but I just wanted some friction
Like, I didn't want no... And the fingers don't count

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Bitch, I know about you
Hanging with LaQuita brought the ho up out you
And now you acting like you don't know about it
Look I ain't really tripping, want some more about you
Now wait a minute! Bitch, I know about you
Why you telling business they ain't know about it
That's the wrong way to try to go about it
They gon' check your ass out with no deposit
Now pay attention

[Pre-Hook: Jay Rock]
And that's the way
Pussy on my hotline, that's the way
Plans on my trap phone that's the way
Numbers in my paper bag, that's the way

[Hook: SiR]
She gon' pop bottles, that's for sure
When we roll up, she roll up, that's for sure
She love ridin' high, sittin' low, that's for sure
Don't matter where we go, for sure

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
I know you heard about me
Walk mellow talk mellow, plus I'm quiet as fuck
My exterior composed, but inside I'm a nut
And after drinks and a blunt, I'm redesigning your strut
Got you rewinding and take, wiling and smiling and such
Keep your vagina in touch, dialing my line in a cut
This hydrophonic and got you hot with the bottles and bubs
On top of that, this dick and dollars done got you in love
Now wait a minute! Bitch, I know about you
Hanging with LaQuita brought the ho up out you
And now you acting like you don't know about it
Look I ain't really tripping, want some more about you
Now wait a minute! Bitch, I know about you
Why you telling business, they ain't know about it
That's the wrong way to try to go about it
They gon' check your ass out with no deposit
Now pay attention

[Pre-Hook: Jay Rock]
And that's the way
Pussy on my hotline, that's the way
Plans on my trap phone, that's the way
Numbers in my paper bag, that's the way

[Hook: SiR]
She gon' pop bottles, that's for sure
When we roll up, she roll up, that's for sure
She love ridin' high, sittin' low, that's for sure
Don't matter where we go, for sure

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I’m Facebookin', I’m Trap-chattin'
I got the gram Snap-shotty
I got the bars, a couple bands
Gotta jook, that be religion, it got us prayin' for a plug
Oh you ain’t know? Girl I’m the man
Clap-clappin' at you haters while she clap her cheeks
She want my attention it’s all part of her strategy
This game is set for checkmate, pieces across the board
Don’t matter what be your feature, we all lookin' for more
Gotta score, pay attention! Bitch, I know about you
Hanging with LaQuita brought the ho up out you
And now you acting like you don't know about it
Look I ain't really tripping, want some more about you
Now wait a minute! Bitch, I know about you
Why you telling business they ain't know about it
That's the wrong way to try to go about it
They gon' check your ass out with no deposit
Now pay attention

[Bridge: Jay Rock]
Big money, all hunnids
How you want it, we can run it
Ten boppers, they swing
Drop it low, do your thang, do your thang
Big money, all hunnids
How you want it, we can run it
Ten boppers, they swing
Drop it low, do your thang, do your thang

[Pre-Hook: Jay Rock]
And that's the way
Pussy on my hotline, that's the way
Plans on my trap phone that's the way
Numbers in my paper bag, that's the way

[Hook: SiR]
She gon' pop bottles, that's for sure
When we roll up, she roll up, that's for sure
She love ridin' high, sittin' low, that's for sure
Don't matter where we go, for sure
