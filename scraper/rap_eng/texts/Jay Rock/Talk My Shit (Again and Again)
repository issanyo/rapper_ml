[Intro: Jay Rock]
Now these niggas don't want me to win
I guess I just gotta talk my shit then
Aye

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
[?] like Top Ramen is spread from the bounty
This hunter is aiming straight at your head, niggas doubt me
Tell em' they better count me in, like Dracula
Packing a black mack in the back of a magnum
You rappers is gon' go
That's one hell of a punch line but let's get back to the flow
Left jab hit your nose
Right hook fracture your skull
Your body is free
Put luxury tax on your soul (OG)
That's what they yelling when I'm pulling up
Like a rough rider working out in the hood and stuff
They say I ain't in the hood enough?
Bitch I'm a transmission
The pump leak when your oil slipping
And I been in the kitchen, like a toaster
With them toasters, hang you like a Willie Lynch poster
East side vulture, preying on your dead caracas
Sorry I was starving

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Niggas out here don't want me to win
So I talk my shit again and again
(Again and again)
Imma talk my shit
(Again and again)
Imma talk my shit
They say I ain't got what it takes to win
So I talk my shit again and again
(Again and again)
Imma talk my shit
(Again and again)
Imma talk my shit
(Let the games begin)

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Imma talk my shit cause I made
Every stripe that it takes
To be able to write what I say
The beat made you hype for the day
The beat made me write with a sway
Me and Jay bring the night to the day
And bring the night to the page
As far as bars go
Literally up there fam I call the stars home
I'm by far past far from the forlorn
I leave this bar open unless you log on
Figure that part out
Wikipedia that
I Wikipedia whack and look up your stats
More fuckers start hiding when they get on the track
They ducking behind the snare like I ain't divvying that
And if you speaking of the speaker
I'm the speaker that the speakers applaud for
Speaker that the speakers turn on for
I'm leaking through the speakers on all y'all
My short term speaking is long haul
Your speaking is all gone

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Niggas out here don't want me to win
So I talk my shit again and again
(Again and again)
Imma talk my shit
(Again and again)
Imma talk my shit
They say I ain't got what it takes to win
So I talk my shit again and again
(Again and again)
Imma talk my shit
(Again and again)
Imma talk my shit
(Let the games begin)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Straight from the Pyrex pot
I'm a crack rock wait
Grab the A1 sauce let's raise the stakes
Catastrophic K.Dot
Currently stacking currency
Bet I make profits like I'm God
Every instrumental get dealt with
Burnt and melted
Jump in the water
Jaws is ready to eat you selfish
I'm cold hearted
That's for sure
Talk shit like a nigga farted
But the smell came out the other hole
(Yuck)
Hol' up, big truck
Lurking the premises
Pull up, hoes rubbing they clitoris
What the fuck?
This is K.Dot, they pray I
Fall like a jump shot
From they favorite player
With seconds on the clock
(Yep)
Im here to souffle ya'
Turn rappers into
Anything barbecued
They're miniature party food
I get spizzy
Like I'm Hugh Hef "Come fuck with me"
One first tonight
Might change your life, right?

[Outro: Jay Rock]
Yeah
Imma talk my shit
'09 is mine nigga
Ain't no stopping me homeboy
I'm coming
Get with it or get lost
Roll with it or get rolled the motherfuck over nigga
Skyzoo wassup my nigga
K.Dot what's happening brother
Top Dawg Entertainment nigga
Get with it or get lost motherfuckers
Ain't no stopping us nigga
Yeah
