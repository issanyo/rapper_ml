[Verse 1]
I'm from the L.A. Times side, the L.A. crime side
Long-term might be homicide
Used to move with them Rugers
Talk shit, we shoot you at your dice game
Rob you for your moola
It's like that, cash rules everythin'
Fiends' strung out, so they try to sell you anythin'
Listen, son, I never sold crack for fun
I was hungry, shit, I sold crack for funds
Had to get my weight up, enemies' sprayed up
Got with it a whole brick, then we re-up
Sittin' in the money spot, cookin' up the product
Try to infiltrate the shop, you got shot up
Little kids in the projects, they want to be us
No father figure, there's nothin' that you can teach us
Yeah, the streets raised us, blowin' weed and [inaudible]
Gangbangin', paint slangin' for decimals
Yeah, and I'm spittin' in the whip
Yeah, it's Jay Rock and I'm on my shit
Me and [inaudible] gettin' them long checks
Well, I'm ridin' [inaudible] straight to Watts, it don't stop
Sounwave in the back chillin', I'm in New York chillin'
And I'm tryin' to get a million, better yet, a billion
So I can buy me a buildin'
You know how it go, Jay Rock
Chillin' right here with Crazy Al Cayne
You know it don't stop, yeah, the boy's insane
Straight off the top, you know I'm representin' Watts
It don't stop, on your 112, it be block
Uh, when I get back home I'm finna get it in
Like 50, yeah, I'm tryin' to get fifty more, more
And that's how we do it, right here, heh, right here
