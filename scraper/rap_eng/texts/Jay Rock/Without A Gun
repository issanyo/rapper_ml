[Intro]

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
45 loaded, in my pocket
Everywhere I go I got it
Never leave my house without it
Never know might see some problems
Yes, gotta keep a chopper
Pop lead, that'll stop some drama
Quick, when he feel that copper
Goin' to the gates, he won't see no trauma
[?], got a gun in my car
Sit's on my lap when I'm cruisin'
AK-47 in the back of the trunk
With the Mossberg pump, what I'm usin'
My life I can not lose it
That's why them burners on me
Yeah, that's real shit
Gotta keep it on me all times
Cruisin' through somebody hood without it, you gonna die
On my side every time I ride
It's with me every time I roll
Got a lot of ammunition, we holdin' them Calicos
Semi automatics, slow a nigga down like L.A. traffic
Yes I'm that L.A. bastard
That'll bring you a L.A. casket
Yeah, I know it's tragic but homie that's what we livin' in

[Bridge]
Yeah, never catch it slippin'
Nah, yeah, yeah, never catch it slippin'
Nah, yeah, you will never catch it slippin'
Nah,Yeah, Yeah, never catch it slippin'

[Verse 2: Storm]
Ah look what you did, [?] slipped up big
Left a storm in the back of the building
Went to sleep on the kid, but I'll split your rig
When the raindrops fall through the ceiling
Only took from the [?], but I mastered the green
When I come through blooming
Gleaming with a red dot on your shirt
Hit you and rip you and leave you screaming
Tryin' to do my thing
Tryin' to get that bling
Fuck that, wanna get this cash man
Tryin' find my kin
Tryin' to get that ring
[?] running in the fast lane
Tryin' to whip that Benz
Tryin' to keep my friends
But a nigga be so ungrateful
First they love, wanna hug you
Get caught in the hype, then they hate you
There to take that ride, they be by your side
When the money right there they for you
When you down and out, when you on that drought
Niggas crumble fast life foil
Even that man, that'll hold your hand
The one you thought adored you
So amazing, when this blazing
How a nigga be so disloyal
Gotta keep the heat by my side
When I fuckin' whip these streets
Plus I keep the pump in the trunk
Makin' niggas rest in peace
Yeah this is storm in the track
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me cause
