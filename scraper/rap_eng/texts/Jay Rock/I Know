[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Come on… She wanna roll…
Catch me in the cut with a cup of the juice
I’m chilling, believe this, I’m Jesus to women
They all want to jump in my coupe like a pigeon
Smokey on Friday, find me on the highway
Middle finger up, not giving a fuck
Like a nun who masturbates, congratulate
The [?] in my bathub
See, my style is a cast of
Goldie Mack, super fly, Bumpy Johnson
Holding my Johnson when you jump on my dick
Because haters always like to jump in the mix
Say they can dress but always throwing a fit
They must know I got cream when I’m pushing the whip
That’s whip cream, use your common sense when listening
I strike gold when I roll like a pirate
Soulo won’t you call T-Mobile and play the sidekick
I’m number one…

[Hook]
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz…
And you ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ain’t gotta say my game is on point cuz
And you ain’t gotta say my name is on point cuz..

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
My game on point like fingers in the courtroom
But I ain’t snitching, I’m just winning
I’m just twisting high with the flyest women
Lay ‘em down in my project building
They catch feelings like root canals
I boot ‘em out when they talk about lovey-dovey
Shut up and fuck me, low key with my broads
Make sure they never cross paths
Cuz if they ever do it’d be all bad
I play the role like Samuel L
Tell the hoes what they really wanna hear like
You my boo, you my baby, you my number one
Drop it off in the drop then tell another one

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me, I ain’t trying to see the grave
I’m just trying to get fresh to death
I’m in the club with a mean two-step, like the sisters to Cinderella
The clock strikes midnight
I’m still in the spotlight like a lab rat, bad back spazzing out
Sip henny until I pass out, or mash out like a sack of potatoes
Looking for a good girl gone bad from Barbados
To bring to the pad
Not for the mouse, but to the house, calling a cab and I’m kicking ‘em out
Nah, I don’t run it like Chris Brown do
But I can make a tune you can sip Krystal to
My game on point cuz my aim is sharp, even when it’s dark
Travis Bark, famous star, rider
But don’t blame the car, I’m an eye’s desire
You would go blind sizing up my attire
And you ain’t gotta say your boy is that hot cuz I know I’m that hot
Like arguing with a narc with rocks in my socks
I walked in the door, she said “Who are you?”
I said SOOOUUUL
