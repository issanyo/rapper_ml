[Intro: Isaiah Rashad]
Man, I'm just writing shit don't get mad when we're tryna rap
Listen me in this motherfucker..
Yeah

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad]
I'm just one dirty motherfucker, hurt myself way more than you
This too much out here for the cup, I put that codeine in my soup
Used to spit in granny face, I'm supposed to show you love
I don't need no picket line and I don't need no fuckin' hug
You just rappin' just because, with your napkin full of drugs
Too exclusive in the back, should we sneak 'em in the club?
Who is that nigga if I ain't that nigga?
It ain't that poppin' if I ain't with Robert
Gotta consider my liver, my nigga
Gotta get rid of my kidney, my nigga
That was the only thing holding me back
None of these niggas ain't tellin' me shit
Lately I only been bumpin' that Yachty
All this Burberry on top of my body
I knew Lil Sunny would get me that 'Rari
Pullin' up tryna tell me the truth
I hit you back like, lil nigga, revise it
Look what I got, bitch, it's Tity and Dolla
Tell 'em lay back and just check out the power

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad]
Sweet line I used to walk, we used to want
Just wanna be, like one of them
But now I don't, I ran away
I ran away, I ran away
I know that bitches gon' be with it but I love them hoes
Just call before 'fore you come, just call before you go
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call it before you come, just call before you go
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call before you, just call before you come
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call before you, just call before you
Yeah call before you come, bitch!

[Verse 2: Hugh Augustine]
I be on my own shit, what's the motion?
Condoms, weed, and lotion, wavy like the ocean
I got no emotions, dolo in the function
You ain't in my section, you can't tell me nothin'
She just wanna sip on the real pink soda
Ride with a big billed .40
Slide through the hood, I know it's all good
I ain't from the set but I still got soldiers
Seven when I roll the dice, Henny straight, hold the ice
Lately I don't take advice, claimin' we don't live for twice
Send you to a poltergeist, treat the beat like I planned a heist

[Bridge: Hugh Augustine]
I know bitches just wanna be hoes
No hoe just wanna love me
Know she wanna get cuddly, sip the bubbly
With an OG smokin' OG
I know bitches just wanna be hoes
No hoe just wanna love me
Know she wanna get cuddly, sip the bubbly
With an OG smokin' OG

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad]
Sweet line I used to walk, we used to walk
Just wanna be, like one of them
But now I don't, I ran away
I ran away, I ran away
I know that bitches gon' be with it but I love them hoes
Just call before 'fore you come, just call before you go
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call it before you come, just call before you go
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call before you, just call before you come
I know bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call before you, just call before you
Yeah call before you come, bitch!

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I peep, I know, I know why hoes ain't fuck
With your boy now they wanna say hi when I go by
Gang sicker than ebola, bitch
Know when to roll up when I load my .45
Sheesh, fine lines I cross between
Pimp shit and try to enjoy this life
Yeah bitch I know what it's like
You get whatever you wish long as your coin is right, right
Wake up to the real tamale
So ill might kill somebody just for GP
Be me with a white bitch
Waitin' around the corner in a Mustang GT
I ain't talkin' bout much
Nothin' but fuckin' and countin' a few bucks
I'm all that shit you talk
My crystal ball show your future when I cruise up, now listen
All I want is gravy for my steak, bitch
I'm gon' grind for this weight
That means I gots no time to wait, bitch
'Fore you fry my chicken, scrape that resin off that plate, bitch
No cut, no chase, I'ma do my place so cut that fake shit
That's fake shit, biiiiitch

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad]
Sweet line I used to walk, we used to want
Just wanna be like one of them
But now I don't, I ran away
I ran away, I ran away
I know that bitches gon' be with it but I love them hoes
Just call before 'fore you come, just call before you go
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call it before you come, just call before you go
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call before you, just call before you come
Bitches gon' be bitches but I love them hoes
Just call before you, just call before you
Yeah call before you come, bitch!
