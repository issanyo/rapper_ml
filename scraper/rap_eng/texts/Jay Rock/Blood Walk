[Intro]
Like that
Like, like, like that, like, like
Do the Blood walk, I do the, do the Blood walk, I do
Do the Blood walk, I do
I do the Blood walk

[Verse 1]
I be that nigga they call Jay Rock, comin' straight out of Watts
You know I keep my Bloods with me cause we be's off the block
Know that black khakis, black .45 talk
Throw my (?) red Chucks, red strings
Throw my hood up in your face
Soo-woo, shoot through, cherry red Chevrolet
Hittin' switches on them bitches, smokin' purple everyday
Sittin' sideways, leanin' off that Cuervo
Shoot a nigga down, keep killers on a payroll
Steady, screamin' "Rock know," but, nigga, I don't know shit
But to get some money, fuck the bitches, stackin' mo' chips
Got to hit my 'hood though, niggas (?)
My goons throw niggas in the trash like some garbage
These (?), Maserati crawlin'
Beatin' down your block, knockin' pictures off your wall
And I do my Blood walk, I do my Blood walk
Two-step, throw my 'hood up, yeah, this Blood raw

[Hook]
Like that, naw, like this
Give it up, give it up, slide like this
Two-step, slide like this
Do the Blood walk, I do mine like this
Like that, naw, like this
Give it up, give it up, slide like this
Two-step, slide like this
Do the Blood walk, I do mine like this

[Verse 2]
Two-step, slide like this
Do the Blood walk, I do mine's like this
Rest in peace (?)'s relative on the replay
Niggas disrespectin', catch a slug when the heat spray
Back in '98, it was Crip walkin' craze
Now it's '08, niggas Blood walkin' brazy
You see that footwork, now that's a work of art
We hit a party, watch my dogs tear the floor apart
And we don't cha-cha, we just rock, ma
Them Chuck Taylors do their job
Look, we mob through the neighborhood
Bouncin' like a kangaroo, jumpin' like it's '92
Sippin' on that (?), slangin' pipe like (?) do
Soo-woopin' with my fellow troops
We on fire like them hollows when the metal shoots
And you know Rock do his thing
Blood walkin' with my niggas in a pit of flames

[Hook]
