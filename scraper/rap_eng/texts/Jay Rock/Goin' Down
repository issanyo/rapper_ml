[Intro]

K. Dot, got this fiend saying, Baby
Man we got that got shit over there
Watts finest, and the Hub City's threat, lets go

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
On the table, I'm chopping rocks
My price is right, you could come on
Nigga, dimes n dubs
Just bring me your bucks
I'll hook you up with weed, dope or angel dust
My burner talk I'm goin'
To the block where the holdin' them
This place is popping 'till she put the chickens in the kitchen
Can't  sell dope forever, but I gotta make a living
Running your mouth it's goin'
Sold your soul, gotta get shot
Yeah, yeah the code of the streets
Never talk to police
Don't even talk dog
Forever hold your peace
Feds at ya door, it's goin'
Kicked in your door, get on the floor, get
They found all of your dope, now you gotta go
To the federal penitentiary dog, for ten or more
In the hood it's goin'
Rock's settin up shop is goin'
I got that ghetto white
Customers light your pipes
Come to the back door
I got what you like
I you know where it's at come
Rock and K. Dot will hold you (down), Tell 'em Dot

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar and (Jay Rock)]
If you want us come see us
Backdoor procedures
We got what you need
As our profit increases
Walking from Centennial, going home like
Straight down Central, got banged on
I ain't even have the pistol
If death was the issue
This shit, I guess it will be a sad song
So I'm thinking to myself like down
They bust a u-turn, so I know I'm goin'
I ain't no bitch or nothing
But if they just start jumping
I got no heat, so fuck it, I'ma start running
Before them shots come flying
Call my nigga Ralo like
Hold a nigga (down)
He ain't had no minutes
So a nigga just hopping fences
But if I do get popped, I hope he'll be a witness
But luckily he turned around
I got home like safe and sound
Now I'm back to the block
Where my uncle was [?] dishing off the rock
Stay ducking them cops
Cause you know they will lock a nigga
For them small grams, or them pounds
But they won't stop my profit
Or get in my pockets
(Even if it means a nigga gotta) sell narcotics
(We gonna hold shit)
(Open up shop across) town
Cause we gonna get this cream
No matter how hard it seems
We gonna do it together see were a team
(Rock)
