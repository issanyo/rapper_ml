[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a minute
I'm give it to you though

[Verse]
Yeah, Rock been doing this shit, east side up
Hearts get to skipping a beat when we ride up
9-double-0-5-9 that's the zip, dog
Don't make me put 3 in your back like Chris Paul
We just go straight to the facts, been the shit dog
Even if the globe on my back down in the pitfall
When Top Dawg drop this shit, haters they pissed off
They tell me Rock the street is yours, go and get yours
Riding with that big ass yopper with a bad ass bopper
Swerving lane to lane pass that vodka
All we see is a bunch of dickriders
Fake ass hoes with silicones in they dreez-awers
Cheesy ass chain wearing niggas claim they be hard
We don't even believe y'all
What's brackin' nigga? Whats crackin' nigga?
Never walked the yard but I ran with killers
And if you got a guilty conscious what's happenin' nigga
You don't wanna meet your heroes
You don't wanna meet your heroes
They're known to sink your shit like torpedoes
They say a nigga broke and aggressive
If I'm broke and aggressive
That means I hit your section, impressing to bring the depression
I'm watching you like VEVO nigga
I'm peeping through that keyhole nigga
So my advice you better change your locks
Cause when I kick doors down, nigga, things'll pop
I see you getting racks and I see you getting 'Lacs
You see me and my niggas gettin' strapped
Yeah, the homie, he just got up out the max
It's time to pay just what you owe, so you know you gettin' taxed
I'm rolling up phillies nigga
Thinking about billies nigga
Check come through, yeah I'm popping the wheelie nigga
Straight to the dealership
No flocking no stealing shit
Straight cash money, on my Bryan B. Williams shit
Better yet this is a robbery, pushing up on your property
Kicking off of monopolies, been here sounding so properly
It  ain't no stopping me, yeah I'm fulfilling prophecy
Robberies yeah they obsolete, better keep all your eyes on me
Watch me closely, move ghostly, hit them hard like cold cheese
Don't sleep, and after that I'll give you something to smoke
That A1 Peruvian, ain't no cut on this dope
Rock

[Outro]
That's it, seven to midnight every night
This the lift off
Let's get it
