[Jay Rock]
Jay Jay Jay motherfucking Rock demand the respect
I'm about to bring my mothafukin coast back
This very moment is a Kodak, welcome to killer county
Please wipe your feet on the door mat
It don't matter the weather, I bring it where the is storm at
Tip-e-toe, through a Tornado (I'm that heavy)
The six-four chevy , the color is grey on spaghetti
I love it and you do too
I let the California sun rays
Beam on my sunshades
Murder competition till I'm seen on the LA Times front page
And I lean on anything (move) please get out my way, I'm proving greatness
And I ain't coming out as the underdog
Pac told me years ago
I've been way better then y'all
The time that I've put in was federal
Conversation on lips, my city talking listen

[Jay Rock]
The city talking to me
The west coast talking to me
They keep talking to me
Down five up, in my soul
Cuz we, cuz we been down too long
So give me the strength to lift us up
Cuz we here waiting for that day to come

[Jay Rock]
Nigga we bang like
West coast, west coast, bang like
Two times for the motherfucking game
Three times for the Source magazine
Breaking down my rap lines, trying to depict what I mean (what'you mean?)
Ever since thirteen I've been waiting for the day to bring my name on the state
Now I'm here, look at here
See me on your TV screen, I do it the worst way, I deserve a letter ehh
They say bring it back, so I do bring it back to the city which is the L.A su Brooklyn su
All the same nigga, they lookin at me like, who are you?
Shit you know my name Jay Rock, but you could call me cocaine, I'm that crack rock
Role with me let that ass drop I move quicker, something in the stashbox with me
LAPD lookin, but fuck cops, I don't hear em, all I hear is my city talking.. listen

Told you we bang like.. Top Dawg
Yeah T-Pain like
Two shots for the you motherfuckin lames
You got alot of money, I got gun, we can exchange
Give me your funds, and if I kill you, you gain a name
Over these tracks I move like a motherfuckin freight train
Your career in the way, I run over that
I got one under my seat
Two inside the knapsack two of your friends with you that's three hundred each
Shots of course, could've saved 2Pac Shakur
It's just the thug in me, I make your top come off
You pop some bubbly
We celebrate after your departure, your greater god'aw'father
West coast I'll be your father, small children getting on my nerves
And I don't wanna be bothered, I don't wanna be obseverd and followed
Well maybe I do, since I'm the leader of this new school.. Jay Rock
