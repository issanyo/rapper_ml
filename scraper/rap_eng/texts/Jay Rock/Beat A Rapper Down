[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I'm the realest, I be the illest
Like a heart pacing, John Q's offspring
No spare, I'm one set of car keys
No heir, I'm already the king
Can't breathe, too high up here
Give me the crown, Jay Rock it right now
Like NASA, turbo boost fast past ya'
Like lion's blood over your door
Cos I'm a blood like what pours after war
And that there's for sure
Like the beginning of every sea
I'm heavy as B.I.G
And driving them crazy like I belong in the DMV
Stay on my TIP like [?] do Clifford Harris
I'm more like a rap terrorist
In fact I'm back with Busta, bussin' your head
In front of your mother, motherfuck you
Tuck your tail like scared mutts
I'm nuts like cashews
I don't care if you hardcore with plenty tattoos
What I'm bout to do..

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Beat a rapper down
Got the big tin boots stomping on your city ground
Knocked your red nose off a motherfucking clown
Circus acts get the axe when I hop on tracks
The wack nigga wanna [?]
I'mma beat a rapper down
Like he stole something, I'mma take his soul from him
[?] alphabet and give him that G-code cousin
Anybody [?] down, I'mma beat a rapper down

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Fuck your plans up despite the preparation
And I twist a nigga like a rubik's cube configuration
And I fuck the place up, you know my [?] no mistakin'
Put a spell on niggas, turn you to a frog like I was [?]
And I'm quick to bust a nigga, had you wondering what's next
And hi-juh-jaja, just like a nigga suffer from turrets
See now you bumping to the best and got me angry off the ring
These niggas bloody till they blood is drippin' off my fingers
With my real blood nigga Jay Rock, let's get it poppin'
Never stoppin' nigga
Cop a ratchet for me, let me shoot this nigga
And then it drop, just let me flop
And then [?] need another obstacle
I'm quick to spaz and be the stupid nigga
Now read the number on the doc
And close the case before I ring this nigga arm right out the socket
And take the same arm and then freeze it cos I ain't finished
Take his arm, throw it out and start beatin' his ass with it
What I'm bout to do...

[Verse: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock, beat a rapper, eat a rapper, feed a rapper to my goonies
He no phantom go and find 'em, bring 'em to me
I'mma grind 'em in a coffee pot
Put 'em deep inside a coffin box
[?] a snicker, cough a lot, I got the (hiccup)
On any artist, run a silence apartment
But [?] that could blow up a community
See you and me, we not the same
I'm usually a walking flame
Burning on your steps with a cheque and an awesome aim
Catch your breath, I'm buggin' out with Busta
In your momma house, we taking everything out the kitchen
Pay attention, it's war time
See we gunnin' for your throat
When I drop down these lines, make sure you snort the coke (coke)
Your flow, no go, my flow
Many excite though
Power pack, watch me bring it back (yo)
Forever cold with it like a eskimo's
Livin', feelin' funky like Jiminy Cricket
When you lift your feet, I'mma
