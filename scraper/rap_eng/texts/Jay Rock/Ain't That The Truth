[Hook: Jay Rock]
Real niggas do real things
Bitch niggas do what they can
Ain’t that the truth, hood shit is flowing through veins
Real respect real in this game, Ain’t that the truth

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I’m sitting in the coupe with dark tints
Sitting to my side is a dark bitch with ass and soft tits
And if I walk it I talk it I spit it how I live it and I get it how I live in the gardens
And I’mma shine regardless
Niggas talk about jewels but tell my how you shine with a raw wrist
I’m not ya average artist, a microphone arsonist
But still I’m rough and rugged like grandmas carpet
I ain’t gone lie I was dirty as fuck
Now I got a lil paper thats what clean me up
But I’m still that same nigga I ain’t change nigga
If I got it to give I’mma give keep it the same nigga
I was that block pitcher, yeah that chain flipper
In the hood serving rock to the cane sniffers
You tryna paint pictures gotta have the right tools
Come up on that rough road make sure you some nice shoes

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Real niggas do real things, bitch niggas do what they can
Ain’t that the truth, hood shit is flowing through veins
Real respect real in this game Ain’t that the truth

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Niggas say I changed cause I got paper
Be the niggas with no paper running they mouths like hot water
Niggas i thought was my friends wasn’t really real
Backstabbers, fake as a 2 dollar bill
Niggas mad cause Jay Rock got a deal
Talk about me when I’m gone but quite when I appear (shhh)
It ain’t gone hurt me none use it for fuel
And shine bright as the sun
Sucks as niggas riding the next mans dick
Like a bitch need that for females or ride your own shit
When I walk in the room I feel tension
Speak or forever hold your peace before I start spitting nigga
I don’t give a fuck a project nigga til’ I’m gone
The hoods in my blood you can hear it in the song
Niggas tryna push me but I ain’t budgin’

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Real niggas do real things, bitch niggas do what they can
Ain’t that the truth, hood shit is flowing through veins
Real respect real in this game Ain’t that the truth

[Verse 3]
You ain’t bout this keep your face in them books
Out here niggas get murdered for looks
I just stick to the ave. pushing them bags
Fiends flagging me down like a taxi cab
If you late on that cash that thing click and blast
Bullets stick to your ass like a maxi pad
Leave you dead on the scene and I’mma shake it fast
Now your ass history a thing of the past
Like nascars I have you earn heart racing
I’m hot you could you ain't never blazing’
I got something for you bitch niggas player hatin’
Bullets hit ya have that ass levitatin’
I’m tryna shine like Paul Walls grill
For the money have your mouth on that sawed off steal
I’m still starving I’ll take your mill I’mma quarterback show you how them bullets really feel

[Hook: Jay Rock]
Real niggas do real things, bitch niggas do what they can
Ain’t that the truth, hood shit is flowing through veins
Real respect real in this game, Ain’t that the truth
