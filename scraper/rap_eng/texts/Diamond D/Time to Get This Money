This is for my niggas who plot when I come through
Wanna stick me with their Glocks, but we got those, too
Wanna come with a creep, you'll get done on the streets
Got the gun on the seat, so don't come on a creep
This is for my nigga who come through and floss on the block
Push the Porche and it's dropped, extortion is the plot
Dolo or dulo, you or I, you rock the 5 or rock the Yugo
It's do or die
This is for those cats that specialize in robberies
Scheme at red lights, these clowns even follow me
I lay in the cut and wait for the rush
And if he hate I'm a bust, and that'll straighten him up
This for those cats that get the cream and want to floss the flavor
I'm forced the take the pound and lay 'em down
Extort the paper for some new ware plus some sky blue Airs
Right off the bat, pop the gat like the New Years

"If you with me, then say word" "Nah mean?"
"Time to get this money"
"Diggin' in the Crates" "The one and only"
"Time to get this money"

Yo I'm like whatever, my attitude is "What"
Swearing at me like you a killer, still you butt
See me on the block and still say "What's up?"
Yeah I see through the glass but I lay in the cut
You think I'm playing or what? Got a in the cut
I pull out, niggas start praying and duck
Take your little 10K's without paying a buck
Then I jump in the whip without saying a fuck
See it's like that, bring it on, strike back
Laying on the floor saying, "Where my Nikes at?"
What you thought gonna happen saying, "Where the ice at?"
Now you in dying need of an ice pack
Upset cause you sleep where the mice at
See me holding cake and you wanna slice that
But I'm nice at G niggas price that
See me on the ave son, where the dice at?

"If you with me, then say word" "Nah mean?"
"Time to get this money"
"Diggin' in the Crates" "The one and only"
"Time to get this money"

Yo, this nigga must tell time with eyes cause he clocking
Parking his whip inside of my hood bopping
Sticking this duck, for me there ain't no stopping
I'm a get his as for coming through flossing (shit)
I'm on the block selling coke and I'm still broke
While this duck coming through and he a showboat
Man he's as good as a got, go upstairs load the Glock
Wait for sundown, hide in a vacant lot
I'm a few steps away from where he parked his wheels
I'm feeling envious so I break the windshield
He emerged with a bitch from the building
Itching to get his as so I lay flat in the grass
It's like unseen dog shit, fresh from a red-nosed bitch
Known for the blood line in the crib
Motherfucker run his shit, shines all gleaming from the
First time I seen y'all I was scheming

"If you with me, then say word" "Nah mean?"
"Time to get this money"
