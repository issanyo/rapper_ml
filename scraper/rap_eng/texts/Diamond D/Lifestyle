[Chorus: x2]
I'm checkin out yo lifestyle, oh you a trojan
I know you hopin' that you get chosen
I like 'em frozen, icy wit the platinum

{Verse 1: Gangsta Boo}
Aye sexy wetman you don't wan test me
Ride ya ass to sleep since you doin all dat flexin
Magnum XL, but I don't kiss an tell cut a few rappers but its cool cuz dats my business hell

{Verse 2: Rasheeda}
Gold pack or the black pimpin I can handle that
We can do the damn thang yean ain't gotta hold back
Lam skin boy naw, it's like goin raw dawg

[Chorus x2]

{Verse 3: Princess}
Step up in to club niggas choosin tryna get in my jeanz
I'm too cute fo you but yo friend can come teach me some things
Fuck the motion in tha ocean cuz the niggas gotta have a boat
If his dick too small then shit will sink and it can never float

Fuck a trogan I need magnums real niggas can understand
If you can't fulfill my needs then hit tha road I gotta go, Rasheeda, Diamond, Princess, Booty tho we come back fo more

{Verse 4: Diamond}

But I rather stick ta pimpin wit good grane grippin Im a mack
Catch a quicky then I'm outtie yea won't doubt he bring it back
Jus tha fact that I don't love 'em leads to trouble if he mean to me
Gold package magnum wit tha platinum cuz I need a G

[Chorus x2]

{Verse 8: Gangsta Boo}
If you ain't sized up please get tha fuck up
You be wastin all my time, I guess yo ass is outta luck
