[Intro:]
Yea yea
Yea yea
Yo yo
Yea yea
Yo

[Verse 1:] [Rhapsody]
Pu pu pump ya brakes
If they sayin we ain't hot
When they conversate
I’m on my underate
I shine like a constellation
One of many I’ve been reppin for the Zulu nation
No time wasting
We stay ahead like Asians
In zones checking light phones
I’m killing it lately
Bring back the basement
Like a choked them with laces
They’ll never hold me back
Like a mouth full of braces
Buckle up like Kurupt in ‘98
Whatever codes, i’m trying to hold the globe in the race
I’m tortoise
In the end I still go to first
Curtains like Eminem caught you niggas hurtin
In your feelings when he lost control
I’m having visions of you with [?]
Throw up when I show up
And this my easy flow
Diamond in the rough
Homie Diamond D should know
And this is proof to show
You should

[Chorus:]
Pu pu pu pump ya brakes
If they sayin we ain't hot
When they conversate
(it’s like that)
They gotta
Pu pu pu pump ya brakes
Imma shine when I rhyme
Like the month of May
(it’s like that)
Pu pu pu pump ya brakes
When you crash imma outlast em
Many a day
(it’s like that)
Pu pu pu pump ya brakes
If they sayin we ain't hot
When they conversate
(it’s like that)

[Verse 2:] [Boog Brown]
Yo
Pump ya brakes
We take no shorts
Me and my cohorts score
Givin you that mych more
Nefarious efforts
Kimet with the swords
So oh
Stand on your [?]
Keep on the accord
I spit a vision
Send you back to the board
And of course
We keep it classic
Cause that’s what this affords
On a course to the top
Suckers hope that you flop
Then they see you with the legends
And they hop on your jock
I’m amused after moves
How they plan and they plot
And be shocked when you excel
Wanna get what you got
But i keep a cool head
Keep the hammer out the fool shed
Crack the bedrock
Lay the foundation and watch
We get the building
And they sure to catch feelings
Bet you a million
They ain't’ ready for the realness
Deal with it
You ain’t talkin bout no real limits
Actors and gimmicks
Wrap it up yo
You’re finished
The minute you was ho’in for that rose gold
Is the same minute that I assumed the control
Fraudulent face can’t carry the weight
But Rapsody, Boogie B, Diamond D and the crates
So pump brakes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:] [Stacy Epps]
Dropping speed
But slowing and sowing a seed
Obstacles breathe the air that you need
Opposition to the vision
Keeps you wishing on your mission
Focus
Whenever the speedway
You open better exceed
Not just hoping
Claim the card as my ‘own it’
Never doubting cause I’m on it
Best believe and achieve
In the gifts we needing
Excellence is the call to beacon
Answer it when the phone is ringing
Hello?
Dial toning
You wasn’t even there yet
I learn to expect
Already ready for the next step
While you still waiting on the check
Just come equipped
Before you get lost
Brace yourself
Prepare the cost to be a boss
Just cause we win don’t mean we never lost
Just learn from it
You’ll travel far (far, far, far)
We got to raise the bar, star

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Slow down baby [x2]
Slo
Pump your brakes and just
Slow down baby [x4]
Pump your brakes and just
Slow down baby
