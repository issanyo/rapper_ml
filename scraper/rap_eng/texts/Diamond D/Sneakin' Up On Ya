[Hook: Chip Fu]
Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya
Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya
Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya
Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya

[Verse 1: Poc Fu]
Check the shit that I flips scuba dip doobie dippin'
It's groovy; slammin' like my man Scottie Pippen
Sly like a fox, I kick the shit that rocks
I'm Golden with the Glove, but nice with the shots
Don't try to put me down, I don't feel pain and sorrow
(The sun will come out!) Yeah tomorrow, tomorrow
I bet ya bottom dollar that tomorrow there'll be sun
Showin' gratitude, but my attitude is kind of rude
I walk with a frown while I puff my cigar and
Sit back and stare while I'm cha-cha-cha-charrin'
Watchin' Boogie Down, when they used to put me down
Now your mom give me skins and your pop push me pounds
Sparkin' like a welder, hunt ya like I'm Elmer
Embarass your ass like JJ does to Thelma
Quick to cut your throat, hey boy don't touch the mic
*whoosh whoosh whoosh* Yeah, I'm out like three strikes

[Hook: Chip Fu]
Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya
Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya
Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya
Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya

[Verse 2: Chip Fu]
My lovely and lengthy dreadlocks be roastin on an open fire
Twisted tongue that's slippin' and lyrically limpin'
At your Pinocchi- nose
I'm budda-ba-bad, budda-ba-bad
Budda-ba-bad to the bone and crafty
Sufferin' sucotash, spittin' my lyrics wild like D- Daffy
So pass the blunt so I can really try to figure
How I learned this foolish, foolish lyrical style I deliver
Maybe way down upon a swampy river!
Far far away (hooray!) yippie-kay-yo-kay-yay
Whoa, the dish ran away with the spoon
Ain't th- th- that- that somethi- ni- ning
And then -n I found- fy-fuck-a-five feet of linen-en
I pop eyes like Bluto, ah-how you like judo?
Not Hong Kong Phooey, I chop like some suey
Like doc Bruce Banner I got struck by gamma
So don't- don't you cry- cry for me oh Susannah
Tell your grandma, grandpa, pops and your mamma
That you got the right one, baby, eh-heh!
I'm freakin' the stuttering style, black, just for one reason:
I think it's wabbit, nah-uh duck season
Wabbit season, duck season
Wabbit season, duck season
Wabbit season
Awww shut up and button your lip, it's MC season dagnabbit
And oohoohoohoohooh (whattup Chip?)
I hate rabbits! (shhh)
Be vewy vewy quiet, a hunting we will go
Hi-ho, the merry-o cheerio Chip's about to drop a hot potato!
'Yumpin, 'Yimminy Jiminy Cricket kicks it
Rugged and rough shit like this silly wabbit
I got 'nuff tricks to kick, but I'll chill instead, 'cause
What a wicked- what a wicked- what a wicked- style I, uhh, kicks it
So, uhh, rugged, rugged, rugged, rugged
Rough is how I flips it- flips it *hiccup*
Crazy like a weirdo *cough* my flow's very ridiculous
Like frosted Lucky Charms my shit is magically delishwish
I'm a Chattanooga trooper spunky, a Punky Brewster
Without no fi- foul ups, b- blunders, b- bleeps or bloopers
So holla, pull up, rewind selector
I huh huh, huh huh huh like Woody-dy Woodpecker
Peace to Victor Bramble, too hot to handle
Catch me same b-b-b-bat time and b-b-b-bat channel

Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya
Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya
Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya
Sneakin' up, sneakin' up
Creepin' up on ya, creepin', creepin' up on ya

[Verse 3: Moc Fu]
Arriba, arriba! Pass the boom to M-O smokes the cheeba
A new type of flow and I'll toast the ho, see-ya
Flipper type hitter, quicker to get bigger
Don't believe in guns so the fist become the trigger
I roll in the hood with my Fu-Schnicken niggas (yo niggas?)
Yeah, my motherfuckin' niggas!
The M-O throws blows (blows) obnoxious type flows (flows)
No one knows Bo's but the M-O reads scrolls
Kick dogg pound sounds from miles around
When I *dog squeal* it vibrates your town
Peace to Diamond D, Flavor U-N-I-T
We sneakin' up on ya, watch your ass for nine-three
