[Intro: Raekwon]
Doing this for 1996
Revolution is a trick, be aware

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Yo, yo, yo
I run with rich rap cats who run corners
They run through alleys, navy blue Ballys at the grand finale
Still in all, currency catches the eye of the youth
One time, play it on three corners of the roof
So we accept that, jetting at nights
Don't ever wet that, drop the G-pack how will I eat black
And brothers, flexing labels like cables
White Sables, pressing up, trying to make a debut
Hard times, when the God rhyme I'm aiming mines
Cause he playing mines but
We ain't related cause he raided mine
They see me lamping up in 850's
With 360's, blowing like 160 selling fifties
Due to the wicked, dice should never lie
Now that's a damn lie, proving on standby, man why?
The game, I mentally tear down the brain
Half of us are feeling pain, big boy, let it rain
I guess my whole team is marvelous
Street life novelist, let it rain dun, swallow this

[Hook: Raekwon]
You know how to love me, makes me feel so good (Repeat x2)

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Guess down, a crazy new pair just for the new year
Wavy hair plus we get much cause we on the air
Cristal whyling my medallion, styling it's like city island
Relax kid, while shorty profiling
Until then, we got to bend with the wind
Plus build again, writing my friends sending 'em line Timbs
I'm tired of robberies, pornography
Throw a pair of Wally's on post for live nigga photography

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ghostface]
Check out the hearsay, fake niggas rocking the toupee
Fronting on me and Chef, yo it's dog day
Afternoon I'm blowing up your weak platoon
Leave you helpless, screaming from all types of wounds
I be the expert, blowing like a firework
Converting concepts that will nerve-wreck in concert
Cause I write, and blast and slash your whole level
I'm hosed I be challenging pros for gold medals
Whatever, still remain sturdy like a leather
On Fridays, get your fresh fade from Mo' Better
Represent, my lifestyle is in like Flynn
Militant the God's shit is very masculine
Mad tough, major bless stuff with nuff said
Ex-dusthead, now I'm putting heads to bed
Call me a legend, flexing with the style of old
Carrying loads of loot, mad rich, burying gold
Sabotage, thoughts of living large any day now
The land to satisfy the whole garage
Back to the morrow, soon to make a novel
Born to be selling like Marvel Comic books for my survival
Beware, I'm hitting like a snare from the Delphonics
Crushing niggas I be blowing like economics
What's the... you're fucking with a deadly era
No fat, niggas be jetting when they face terror

[Hook x2]
