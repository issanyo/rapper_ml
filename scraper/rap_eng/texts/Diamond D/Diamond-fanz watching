Fans Watching
Check out my chain, everybody go insane
They even know my name,everybody in my lane
Mrs.diamond make it change,flow insane I decline
Man these shoes I have on these the hottest they done seen
They be clean when you here it I remix make it show it if it got these bad words tell the DJ I don't want it
Its the bad girls every time you walk up in my studio
Then we make it tell Steve to put this on the radio
These feeds never fed us so why yall fans fed up balling so hard
I deserve a record make it so tomorrow they an int even got to do it you so slow you alone
That just my opinion and im gonna kick it like a captain from a soccer team Billie jean
Louie fen call em red lobster and they brain wash head up imma hit the stage why my fans watching
Irma hit the stage why my fans watching [x4]
Drop topping head bottom [repeat]
