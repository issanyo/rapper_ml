UH...

[Hook]
Word is Bond
Buck Buck Buck Buck
Ratatat
And now you punks are picking lead out your asshole X4

[Everlast]
I break it off like a kit-kat
Cause ya can't get that
Worth while style
Underground sound
So now your frontin'
Tryin to fake it
Complain ya never make it
And pretty soon you're broke and butt-naked
So your ass starts to rob and steal
Mad jealous cause my shit's got mass appeal
And now I'm rhymin with Diamond D
With some brand new shit for the year of '93
I got a loop from my crate
That they dug in
The way I'm rhyme on the break
Gets all the brothers buggin'
You know I got the funky sound
You still up un the air
Cause last year I said "Jump Around"
I'm rollin thick
So why don't you can see me
I got mad little white kids
Wishin' they could be me
So don't step up cause I'm a come out blastin'
You just a quickie
Punk, I'm Everlastin'

[Hook]

Now let me hear my man...

[Diamond D]
Yo It's Diamond D
The psychotic
Narcotic
Pete's an idiotic
Smoke the boom thats exotic
With my man Everlastin'
Brotha's be askin' me
For the Fee
Kid, my name ain't Sebastian
Give'em my mom's demo tapes
Foam'n at the mouth
Dreamin' of makin' papes
I know your thirsty
Lord have mercy
I got ten acts
And ya want to be the first, G
Come on  down
Let me breathe ya
Don't be the lint ball on my sleeve
Wanna be down with diggin' wit' the crates
Have dough in the pocket
And sleepin' way past 8
I know the feelin'
Ya wanna be the one wheelin' and dealin'
But your shit ain't appealin'
So make haste
I'll stick it to ya like paste
Don't sleep
I got the 9 on my waist

[Hook]

I lick shot for the Soul Assassins
I lick shot for the Diamond D
I lick shots for the Everlastin'
And lick shot for the D-I-T-C
Yo I'm more respected
My neck's protected
So don't get started
Just disregard it
Cause I'm retarded
And I act real stupid
When I see a bootlegger
Take my record and dupe it
Scoop it
Just like a news reporter
I'm causin' disorder
Cause I'm sorta'
Sick of losing money
When I work so hard
So if I catch ya bootleggin'
I'm a pull your card
