Uhh, uhh, Big fucking baby
Thinking I'm mad real, you know I'm mad chill
Plus I'm mad cool, I be walking right be the school
Offer all the kids cigarettes and then drugs too
But if they don't wanna smoke the drugs, then I don't make them smoke 'em
(Nah you ain't gotta)
Yeah man I'm mad cool
I got mad money that I got from selling mad cigarettes to the little kids
Yeah I'm that kid after school, and I really fucking feel ill
Big baby, you fucking know me
G-A to the N-D to the H-I
Das me tho, being mad cool and shit
I'm on Main Street, Flushing, represent
Baby know me, man I'm fucking mad real
And I'm fucking mad cool and I'm mad chill
This what I really tell myself in the morning before I go and I sell drugs
Cuz I don't sell the cigarettes
In fact I sell a lot of weed
I got mad ziplocs of weed
Ziplocs and bags of weed that I really sell for higher prices
But my shit is like so strong
This is how it was when I was young and a drug dealer
Man I was good at it
Mainly because I was very non-threatening
Made White people feel good
And the Asians, they loved it, I never judged them
It was really really awesome
I made like 200 dollars in one week
That was the most that I ever made
But another week I probably average $75
That's enough money for a little kid
Call me Gandhi one more time
I don't give a fuck, man I said I will stab you
But yo, I be mad chill
And my hair is long, and I'm feeling quite ignorant
And I'm feeling mad care-free
This is how I felt when I was dealing mad drugs to people
Man, people like me
They hit me up, even if it was cuz of just drugs
I really didn't care a lot
It was cool to be wanted, people really trusted me
Now I be a pharmacist
(No no no no no!)
Yup, it really do make sense
Thinking about the life I live
Representin', making money selling people drugs
This is really very common
I don't really even give a fuck, pharmacists know their shit
Plus they help protect people
They do counseling and do medication overview
This helps them be better
It's called MTM, medicational management
All the other shit that you really do is look at their regimen and make sure they ok
This is how I really feel in life
