[Intro]
I'm a black man
And I don't know how to sing
And I don't know how to dance
And I don't know how to preach to no congregation
I'm too small to be a football hero
And I'm too ugly to be elected mayor
But I watch TV
And I seem all them people in all them fine homes they live in
And all them nice cars they drive
And I get all full of ambition
Now you tell me what I'm supposed to do with all this ambition I got?

[Don Barron]
Lord have mercy
Big big respect to each an every man in INI crew
You knowin' how 'fi do
Ima hold the microphone, we no worry about you and you
You see man like Diamond D and the man call Don Barron
Thirsty and come around sound stage yo and party
I will never work for free
Ha ha ha, come go!

[Verse 1: Diamond]
I give relief like a maxi
Jump out a taxi
Converge with Macky doing time in Coxsackie
Tacky head bitches
With lead switches and red britches
I bled witches
With the rest of them dead snitches
You know the M.O
We fog up a limo
With exotic stemmo
The neurotic D-I-A-M-O
N-D, Indeed I got the skills
The home in the hills
Sons that move krills
Season passes to the Buffalo Bills, what?
With sprees on Madison
Bookin' up whole floors at the Radisson
Whatever, cus' nothin' in life is guaranteed
Never underestimate the next man's greed
With the hand speed
I pass out quick ones on slick sons
Who can't fight and run and get guns
But get done
Way before retaliation, (yeah)
Death becomes your evaluation

[Hook]
MC is my ambition.. [x7]

[Verse 2: Diamond]
Marked for death like Steven Se-gal
Even Mi-guel Mu-noz
Said I'm movin' too close
Listenin' to blue notes
Laughin' at the blue coats
Who can't get over a fence because of glucose
With two toast
You and your mans have plans of Mad Grands
But they fell in bad hands
Now in mad lands
You're livin' out your bid
Extortin' ordnance
Runnin' wild givin' shorts
And yo, I'm gettin paid on the rap tip
No more runnin' from cops and gettin' beat with the black stick
Smoother than chapstick
Shootin' my raps quick
Backflips are made when niggas hear my tracks flips
I bat whips, chromed out, blown out
Quick to kick a bone out ya back
In fact, black, I regulate
Through ya chest is where I penetrate
So get it straight
Don't apologize when it's late

[Outro: Don Barron]
Boom wit' this, or that
We 'finna launch an attack
On every MC who come to the dancehall an chat whack
If ya talk too loud I said ya face I'm gonna smack
And if ya reach for your waist, you off an' feel gunshot
But that's my word, I no front, an' I bring war round the back
Then we bury you in a casket Mister 6 foot flat
With some reef and some flowers missin' pon' your grave top
Fuck with Don Barron and Diamond D
And you are fi' get that
So things and times was gettin' rough
And all the MC's they tried to call 'fi my bluff
They wanted some more I guess they didn't get enough
Cause Don Barron and Big Large  and [?] chorus
So every young youth that gonna go set up a plan
Stop killin' off the woman and stop killin' off the man (yo!)
Give me the mic and take the gun outta' me hand (yo!)
Give me the mic and take ya gun outta' me hand

[Hook]
MC is my ambition...[x7]
