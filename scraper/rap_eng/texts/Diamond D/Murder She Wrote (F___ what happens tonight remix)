[Diamond]
Fuck it I'm ready im back on my shit/
Back in this bitch, I'm in the building/
Diamond I'm killin these rappers again/
Murder, first degree I hurt em wit the words I speak/
Let it be known that Every song ive ever been on I turned to heat

Whatever I'm on I turn to beast and murder beats
I feel like im on murder spree/
And still none of yall ain't heard of me/
The top where I deserve to be/
The way I put in work all day long
Then all night overtime no day job

And Sunday thats my shorty and my son day
They hate hard how I pull in racks on my day off/
Pause, I'm spittin that crack, deliver the 8 balls/
It's Diamond design, bitch I'm on the grind/
Your secret desires and way more/

We rising, surprise bitch its Diamond Enterprises/
My Business partner M I A been ridin right beside me/
We headin towards success
Won't settle for less haterz despise me/
They inspire me so never the less I'm never gon rest till I see my dreams/

Turn into reality not a hour sleep
Hustla mentality, this rap machine ain't outta steam/
The kid got so many flows and y'all ain't fuckin wit none
Still talkin bout it I stopped countin at a hunned and one/

I bust it like a semi-auto buckin son of a gun/
Like it ain't nuttin I run it they lovin what I've become

And what i be on I been doin this shit I'm a boss/
When I finish killin em all
Find me chillin singing this song Like/
