[Intro:]
Yeah
Wadup Dan
Nottz Raw

[Chorus:]
All the vanity will make you try to hurt me

[Verse 1:]
Uh-uh, could've said it more better
Ya'll some jealous ass bastards, blame it on the weather
No need no instructions dude, my shit been together
My grind go hand in hand with dope helen
Beat'n down them ??? way before the sun pop up
Been grinding since way back so you hate when i pop up
??? color benz, lil mama ride shotgun
His face look money in the reflection ???
Damn sure does, you hate me
Cuz mi kick thump harder than yours
Snap crack harder than yours
Bassline bunkers, you got to be bunkers to fuck with the boy
All the vanity, is the only thing I can think of why mo'fuckers hate me so much
Nottz and big Diam, two a the ???
Realest niggas still pumping that shit from the underground

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 2:]
I done made TnT and DnD
All about my business EPMD
Nottz Raw, he's the DMP
And ya'll a bunch a new jacks in the city, CMB
I'm from the blocks where no man speaks
It's a motherfucking jungle, Mozambique
Where the weak get preyed on, they go to church where the week get prayed on
Listen, cuz vanity can insight calamity
Nowhere on a trigger is where a haters hand should be
My soldiers got me covered like Humana b
So you should watch your ??? and you manner b
Cuz down the block, thatâ€™s where yo man'll be
When it pops off from the hand of me
It's insanity and blasphemy, a blast for me
What leads to a catastrophe

[Chorus][x3]
