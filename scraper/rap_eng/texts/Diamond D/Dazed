Hook: ATD Direct, Dj Rose, BLXCK Diamond
Wait up wait up wait up wait up hold up I must be dazed from last night. (X4)

Verse 1: ATD Direct
Take it back a lil bit
Why can’t I remember this
I was talking too loud, who was around who was listenin’
Partied too hard. They should expire my membership
There’s a lot of fishes in the sea, I guess that I was a fisherman
I can’t remember what I was doing where I was at last night
Body feeling ten toes feeling like a crushed can sprite
Why was I so specific? Where was last night messed up?
My image maybe I’m not just trippin (but look)
(?) she dropped out of oou. Giving good oou
(?)

Verse 2: BLXCK Diamond
Drop top late night and we rollin
Diamonds on my wrist I ain’t got no Roley
Wind in my face with the juice on my lips
Hit the three wheel three wheel mess up the whip
Got juice I’m dazed in the morning
But the music don’t stop ima keep on flowing
Red lights stop it but I keep on going
Juice down my throat and I keep on pouring
It’s so magical
Had to know
If you from the Arbor tho
Hard to flow with no rari bro. (With no rari tho)
I can spit with anything
Money or not
Money I got
Funds all the late nights now I’m (dazed in the morning)
Juices in my system head keep swirling
(Ah) juice in my system
Head keep- my head keep swirling
Juice in my system
Head keep- my head keep but
