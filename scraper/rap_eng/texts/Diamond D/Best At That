Uh, uh-huh.. yea
Dah dah (I'm skippin jump shit right here)
Dah dee-de-dee dah dah
Da-dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee-de-dee dah dah

[Verse 1]
It's me big D, the psychotic neurotic
Never catch me in the street without some green exotic
Fly-ass whip, pockets stay knotted
Step outta bounds and wind up red dotted
The socialite with the flows ya like
Overweight nigga dressed in the clothes ya like
Probably see me in the club with some hoes ya like
And you know I put it down when it's foes to fight
Can't fuck wit'cha love, if ya toes ain't right
I'm on some bullshit, but yo that's my chosen right
That's cool, cuz all I see is O's in sight
Drop shit that'll lift every nose in sight
Like I'm supposed to do - postin boo
Make you jump around like the Holy Ghost'll do
Let the words get close to you
I'mma show you how cats sleep, just like the most of you
Come on!

[Hook]
When it comes to spittin game I'm the best at that
One extreme to another like sex to crack
Beatminerz and Swing, do, and bless the track
And if the L's too short smoke the rest of that

[Verse 2]
I'm like, Triple H flying off the ropes
Bring a smile like some coke, fresh off the boats
I make, you and your boys take off ya coats
And if ya girl talks back, get her off the soaps
I'm like fuck you, see I'mma scratch ya name
On some big wheel shit, when I match the game
On the low chillin, with a hatch back in Maine
And I still run with niggas that'll snatch ya frames
Yo pardon me, you ain't catch my name? It's D-Moody
In the Four Seasons about to make a nudie
Used to see hard times, but now I see booty
And quite often, be up in the loft and
Fat asses, titties that are soft and, (*women laughing*)
Greened out so you might hear me coughin {*coughing*}
I'll make ya dumbass an off and
I'll be the one to put the nails in ya coffin {*hammering*}

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3]
You get a smack fuckin with this aristicrat
I'm the element that turns coke from this to that
You against me, it's like fightin fist to bat
It's gonna be hard to smoke when your ribs get cracked
Think of that - Come on if you think I'm wack
Me beatin yo' ass in a mink and hat
Bounce off from the scene in a Lincoln Nav
So motherfuckin plush you just sink in the back
And I told you heffers before, never before
Will you see a beatmaker ever this raw
See me in the streets stunning in a yellow Valor
Big D always leave the crowd yellin for more
One of the flyest big niggas you will see
If you can figure that black, you will be
Overcome with a mild case of lunacy
When I drop the LP nigga you will see...
