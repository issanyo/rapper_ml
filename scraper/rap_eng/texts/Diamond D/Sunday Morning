[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't say this
Should keep it all inside
But maybe I'm just wasted
Enough to speak my mind, ah-ah

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been wrestling with the darkness
Searching for a light switch
Tell me can you help me get through?
I've been trying to find a reason
Drowning in the deep end
Can you tell me what I should do?

[Chorus]
I wanna feel high on a Sunday morning
I wanna feel like it's all brand new
I wanna feel strong when I feel like falling
I wanna feel everything you do
I wanna feel
I wanna feel like it's all brand new
I wanna feel
I wanna feel everything you do

[Verse 2]
Show me how you do it
I can see the light that's in your eyes
Tell me when the truth hits
How the hell did you not lose your mind?

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been wrestling with the darkness
Searching for a light switch
Tell me can you help me get through?
I've been trying to find a reason
Drowning in the deep end
Can you tell me what I should do?

[Chorus]
I wanna feel high on a Sunday morning
I wanna feel like it's all brand new
I wanna feel strong when I feel like falling
I wanna feel everything you do
I wanna feel (I wanna feel, I wanna feel)
I wanna feel like it's all brand new
I wanna feel (I wanna feel, I wanna feel)
I wanna feel everything you do

I wanna feel high on a Sunday morning
I wanna feel like it's all brand new
I wanna feel strong when I feel like falling
I wanna feel everything you do
I wanna feel (I wanna feel, I wanna feel)
I wanna feel like it's all brand new
I wanna feel (I wanna feel, I wanna feel)
I wanna feel everything you do

[Outro]
I wanna feel high on a Sunday morning
I wanna feel like it's all brand new
I wanna feel strong when I feel like falling
I wanna feel everything you do
