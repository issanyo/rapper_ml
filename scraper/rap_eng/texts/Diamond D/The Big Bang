[Hook]The milk way enough gas and dust to make million more stars 3x's

[Verse 1] (Danstanee verse)  milk and cookies all I eat Mars & Saturn away from me the big bang theory all i want to do for my math and motion science project it’s crazy because when u add 1 and 1 its equal 2 but when you times its its 4 that’s all i want to do is add them.  ( Jada verse) Hubble's law says expanding universe meaning that it's big , the galaxies we see are moving away and it's  red . when the spectrum is red the wavelengths are short and they not making noise

Edit version: Hubble's law says it's a expanding universe meaning it's big , the galaxies we see are moving away and its red shifted the wavelength increases and frequency decreases

[Verse 2] The Big Bang started 13.7 million years ago and still going on and on when its in the sky its a big spiral and like my dude said its made up of gas and dust the milky way is spiral
Everytime i rap about science i go viral
