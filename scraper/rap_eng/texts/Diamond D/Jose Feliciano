[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
To all my niggas put your lighters up
To all my bitches looking tight as fuck
Jose Feliciano ma I'm outta sight as fuck
I ain't stupid she just want to spend the night and fuck
Yeah I've got my blinders on
All this motherfucking money is what my mind is on
Crisp fitted, nice watch a few designers on
Squizzy , David copperfield
You'se a trick you meet a chick, cop and feel
(Preach) St. Joseph , I don't go in the pocket
Credit score under seven I don't go in the socket
Brash and witty , Flash and gritty
Fuck you gone tell me when ya cash is shitty
I'm a bad boy, never got cash with Diddy
Up in Reign surrounded by ass and tity
Will Sonnett , no brag just fact
Pure amphetamine nigga , no scag just crack
You a straight meatball no swag just wack
Man listen i made the transition
From nice to toxic just watch ya man glisten
Impervious to what you do then
Lookin at your reality the view too grimm
Go upside a niggas dome like duk koo kim
(ouch) these leeches wanna play me closely
Blood sucking niggas, bela lugosi
A bunch of skirts in power, nancy pelosi
You little bitches play hopscotch
I been did it , sippin glenlivet top scotch
I talk about it cause i live it
The game is shitty, i talk about it cause i'm livid
Life in excess , i talk about it cause i'm vivid
Mind blowing . stupendous , hot as lava
Slick wise words hot as java
On tour smashing cute model chicks straight from bratislava
Bed highlights to red eye flight
(ok) i master the shit , jedi knight
Red highlight piping in the whip
(whatchudoin?) G-13 pippin in the whip
No embellishment 100 %
I'll die 1st before I'm left broke, hung in descent
So i live everyday like its the last one
Cause people judge you from the shit you've amassed young
Running with wolves , swimming with sharks
Jesus piece, brimming in clarks
We went from parochial schools to sinning in parks
Know the diff between the real and a bark
