[Intro: A.G.]
Hold up, hold up
I said we make 'em so proud
This that loud, nigga roll up, hold up, hold up
I said we make 'em so proud
This that loud, nigga roll up, hold up, hold up

[Break: Yuna sample]
While you're out there
Out there alight in the dark
I keep my hopes up
While you're out there
Out there alight in the dark
I keep my hopes up

[Verse 1: A.G.]
Many people tell us our style is terrific
It is quite different ("but let's get specific!")
I'll focus on a lyric - mind, body, spirit
Inspires when you hear it, so you feel it
I'm birthed in the Apple, Bronx is the cradle
Fighting off demons, embracing all the angels
Mastered all the angles, you should do the same too
Before your inner self blame you, came through
With the same crew - D-I-double-G-I-N 'til the end
Fill a pen, kill again with the will to win
Nah, we're not like the rest of 'em
In the same sentence don't mention 'em (hold up, hold up)
I said we make 'em so proud, this that loud, nigga roll up
See, Andre's a giant, Joey got that crack
Finesse is the Lord, Mush shine on a track
Buck got the heat, Show got the street
L is still with us, best producer with lyrics
Is D squared, so you better beware
So lit with the shit 'til we leave here
(Hold up, hold up), yeah, yeah

[Chorus: A.G. & (Fat Joe)]
Hold up, hold up
I said we make 'em so proud
This that loud, nigga roll up (often imitated)
Hold up, hold up
I said we make 'em so proud (never duplicated)
This that loud, nigga roll up (D.I.T.C. nigga)
Hold up, hold up

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
I was at the Castle, Dapper Dan on
Finesse on stage, I'm like put your fans on
Ever since the shotgun flew over the sofa
I been building a empire, preserving the culture
Life's what you choose it, crack before music
I put that on the wall, now my name's on the Hall of Fame
Next to L and the rest of the crew
I had to board therefore I was destined to shoot
I'm like Vince with his arm in the rim
Tell ya Honor and them, that I'm never going back
But it's still Cook Coke Crack (Crack)
She stash the dope where her choch at
Don't make me have to give a soul clap, nigga, nigga...

[Chorus: A.G.]
Hold up, hold up
I said we make 'em so proud
This that loud, nigga roll up, hold up, hold up
I said we make 'em so proud
This that loud, nigga roll up, hold up, hold up

[Verse 3: Diamond D]
Uh; and now you got all these non-descripts
Looking for an angle, all dressed up
Like they looking for a bangle, I'm pressed up
I'm just looking for a strangle
'Cause these lames wanna hook and entangle (uh)
In the League of Extraordinary Men
All blessed with the extraordinary pen
Fans screaming now they want the more live six shit
That uncut 1-0-4-5-6 shit, yeah
Bodacious (uh), so gracious
I don't talk much, but the flow is loquacious
(Diggin') rough beats and rough raps
The vanguards of boom bap, fuck that

[Outro: A.G.]
Hold up, hold up
I said we make 'em so proud
This that loud, nigga roll up, hold up, hold up
I said we make 'em so proud
This that loud, nigga roll up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up...
