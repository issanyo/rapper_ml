[Verse 1]
Sharks is out, what you dudes bark about
I only hear when your dark is out
But I know what all the hate and remarks about
Niggas turn Braveheart when the narcs is out
Little dudes washed up as fuck, with no money
Thugged out, no direction, so dummy
I max cards out with a snow bunny
C'mon fam, this shit is the Reynolds, I'm so mummy
And money makes the opposite sex so chummy
Lifestyles of the rich and smart
I'm a self-made man, never snitch and dart
It is what it is, fam; c'mon get your heart
I call em BP niggas -- bench and part, uh
Dicked around, easy grease
No mistake, he's a beast
Nice watch, double M Margiela Jesus piece

[Hook]
Now, if your crew gas your wack ass up, I'mma deflate ya
Pop you like bugs, bubbles, and things of that nature
On the boards or on the mic
Either way, get your ass sent on a hike

Now, if your crew gas your wack ass up, I'mma deflate ya
Pop you like bugs, bubbles, and things of that nature
On the boards or on the mic
Fuck it, on a broad or on a dyke

[Verse 2]
I get cash, get grass, overseas with hash
And got cassettes of flash that I keep in the stash
I push the nice thing with the Breitling on the dash
And it's frightening, I'm like lightning on that ass
And you little Leon Kennedy dudes is too sweet
Just can't find your way, two feet
Can't get your muster up, too beat
Do tweet, these balls do skeet
Wolves looking at your ass, new meat
Weight it out, put it all on a scale
Cause we all know puts it on the frail
Blow away all your dreams on a sail
Soldiers committing felonies on a bail
Right or wrong, we right the wrong
I write the song, the fans sing right along
G shit, you don't quite belong, yeah

[Hook]
