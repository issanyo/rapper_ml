[Produced by Jazzy Jay & Diamond]




[Verse 1]
My name is Diamond, yep you guessed it
Ran a thousand schemes and I've never been arrested
I guess I'm lucky cause I'm young and I'm a black man
And intelligent so everything is relevant
Vision is clear, don't have to wear contacts
Got a good lawyer, no shorts in my contracts
Beats are selected with the highest scrutiny
I played Mr Christian in Just Take Mutiny
Cause this is my destiny, a lot of brothers keep testing me
But you haven't heard the best from me
So remember one thing
A-yo it ain't no thing but a chicken wing
So sit back and listen to the chit-chat
Sweet as a Kit Kat
(Diamond, where'd you get that beat from?)
Yo Jazzy dug in the crate
Needs another loop so we added a flute
Then it came together and I grabbed a pen
Then I double-checked it (for what?), loose ends
The object of a song is to keep your head moving
Hope you find a good A&R man
A lot of acts get signed
And when the album comes out everyone says
(Ah man take that record off, don't waste my time)
Due to that fact I went for mine

[Hook]
I went for mine (Repeat x3)
So go for yours
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 2]
I overcome hurdles like Edwin Moses
Everything was planned but no-one knows this
I'll never go broke since I don't sweat that
I make moves like a man on Ex Lax
D-I to the A-M to the O-N-D
A-yo you got no wins, G
So back up and take a breather, cause either
You must be on acid or from Lake Placid
I hop to it like a kangaroo, I got jumped by a gang of two
But I showed them a thing or two cause I'm not no chump
Now I clock notes cause I make you move your rump
Nothing's for granted, grew up in the projects
Used to wear Tale Lords and Chinese mocknecks
Came a long way from back in the days
When Show went to Smith and I went to Hayes
That was the past and the future will be better
Pass the Moet and keep the Creme Armanette
Peace to Greg Nice and my man Fat Joe
My man O.G. and the rest of the homeys
The Zulu Nation for the foundation
From when I was a kid watching Lost In Space and
I'll never forget cause I'm totally committed
To make slamming joints just to prove my point
In '92 you can't waste no time
Go for yours cause I went for mine

[Hook]
