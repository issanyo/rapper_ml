Hah, respect!
All crew, all massive, everywhere in the world
You practice the art of hip-hop
This goes out to every boy and every girl

Give me relief! I sing!

Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us!

Check it
All beef can be squashed if you want it
But instead of forgiveness, ego you flaunt it
Everybody gets into two or three quarrels
Leadin to a squabble, someone will die tomorrow
Life is not a thing you can borrow
All beefs don't have to lead to sorrow
Will ya, go out tomorrow
I think, you should think about the beef you got
And confront your enemy before it gets too hot
Never feel ashamed, to say, "Yo G I'm sorry
I apologize," the object is to stay alive

I never ran from the Klu Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

(a group says it together)
I never ran from the Klu Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

Yeah!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us!

He said she said, but she said she didn't
Face gets hit, and then, bullets start spittin
No one's admittin to their wrong doing, unfittin
Revenge we're pursuin, look at what you're doin, LISTEN
Release the karma that you're carryin'
Be a mental vegetarian indulge in no beefs, like the
Fish in the aquarium, you'll enjoy it while you're tryin it
There is no seperation between the mind and the environment
Like a bolt of lightning
I'm givin 5000 volts of the occult while I'm writin and recitin
I've come to enlighten black and white to the meaningless fightin
Clash of the titans ain't right
And it's wrong so the song reflects
For too long we've been vexed at each other
Every sister, every brother..
You've gots ta LOVE one another

I never ran from the Klu Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

(a group says it together)
I never ran from the Klu Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

Yeah!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! Check it
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! Ha hah

Give me relief! (That's right)
Squash all beef!

If I ruled the schools, from pole to pole
The entire judicial system would fold
I would get rid of the books cause they bogus
And in school, Knowledge of Self would be the focus
Kids would flock to the schools like locusts
Cause school now relates to them, and you would notice
Violence in society would be a minimal
Cause the education yeah, would now be metaphysical
Not livin by laws, but livin by principal
If you disobey, the UNIVERSE gets with you
We would study giving so no one would steal
And we would read each other's magnetic fields
Petty crimes times petty crimes
Equals prison for lifetimes
The universe divided by two
Equals me and you
Me and you, go into the universe once
Or as one united front
But listen up, when I was growin up in hip-hoppin
We had a thing called Jailhouse Boxin
That's why I'm STILL here rockin
Cause my competition never pulled a Glock in, yeah

Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! Yeah!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us!
