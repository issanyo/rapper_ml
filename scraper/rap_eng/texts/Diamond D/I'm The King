[Intro]

Yo Raheem, I just know you gon make this funky
Cause Diamond D done looked in the crate
And found you this funky beat

[Verse 1]

Party people I'm about to say a rhyme or two
Don't mean to brag but I'm great and you know its true
A pioneer because I speak now that Diamond's here
When I do a show I grab the cash and outta there
It's Diamond D with the crates and the techniques
Money I've got the boss and I need to hear the breakbeat (?)
But if I have to I still make a hit so yo
I gets it in and I head for the studio
No half stepping because I'm out to get mine
For the rhymes that I say just to pass the time
I drink a Heineken, a 40 ounce of novo
For me smoking a buddha on the strength thats a no no (?)
Cause I ain't living like that on the sneak tip
I couldn't make it having jobs on the weekend
I say I'm rough some say that I'm headstrong
But not to the signs of the things that you're doing wrong
But I'm chilling elevating in my own light
My sights strong because I'm never on a stage fright
I let them sting me then I slam with the quickhand
This is the jungle and Raheem is the quicksand
Exhalt the king so the girls can pray to me
I cut them off if they're acting crazy
It's like a blast of the python, sound like a timebomb
One step behind when you have to rely on
Any source and of course im a boss
I torture yours so you just take a loss
No backtalk will I accept when I rip
No time to step cause I ain't done yet
If you come out of line, you'll just step back in (?)
Lock your jaw like a pitbull attacking
A fresh piece of meat that's grinding your teeth
Of the beast of the beat in the rap industry
Cause mines about to cook and come to a boil
Mines stay fresh while yours would just spoil (?)
Any man that steps in my path, will fall to my wrath
Im swift, word to mathematics that I stored in my attic
I shouldn't stop now cause I think that yall had it

[Hook]

Here we go, here we go, come on, I'm the King [Doug E Fresh sample] x4

[Verse 2]

Well I remember it well one January night
At a party I attended and they offered the mic
It was a battle of the best, a challenge of greatness
I signed my name cause I knew I could take this
Swift and relentless when I attempt this
Styles so hard even the truck got dents in (?)
Many was attending but they wasn't winning
Cause I had their heads spinning, soon as the watch stepped in it (?)
Pass me the mic and I was ready to soar
To the floor and get raw till my throat got sore
If they anticipate that it would be great
No matter what I make they fiend for my tape
Now I'm used to making G's at the battles I win
Because I'm deadly with a gun and worse with a pen
As I remove like a cataract so they can see the act
You tried to flip on money? I ain't having that
Cause I'm amazing, I keep the suckers pacing
When my people leaving even when I'm on stage and (?)
I battle off so you know that I'm rocking
I speak fluent math and I'm out to drop it
They bomb so hard and some just get swept up
I earn a big league and I might let you catch up
Let a game of Nintendo money just check the scoreboard
I settle mine cause I'm known as a warlord
I make a crowd look like I was a mouse
Your moms gets scared when she sees me round your house
Call me the exterminator I had to terminate her
I'm on the mic while D slays the crossfader
To make a million is my main ambition
Pulling rhymes out my hat like a mad magician
I'm on the mic at a constant rate
And of course I keep the stamina cause I'm wise and great
Now I'm so artistic when I ever I blitz it
I rhyme so swift that if you blink you missed it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

I treat it like SevenUp they never had it, never will
Speaking of skill now its time for me to build
And elevate till I create another dope style
Make the party people say damn im great
So when I concentrate that will eliminate any doubt
So the judges won't hesitate
Give me the pride, the jewels dont forget the crown
But yo you tried to be cool but yo you still ain't down
I get cash but never scramble cause its a gamble
Now give me a mic so I can show you what I can do
Get creative wild like a native
Supreme overall so call me the greatest
Raheem's the smoothest, I gotta prove this
Go get the mic so we can just go and do it
Set off the New Year with a mic in my hand
Champagne in the other while I chill with my man
And say nine about the time to bust a rhyme
I get mine leave the suckers behind
I read the mic for some thats only a small thing (?)
Money I get applause and cheers soon I walk
In the party, because the girls just scope in
They're startled and amazed by the sound of my roping, (?)
They all say I'm handsome and hold me for ransom
Their moms even say yo give the man some
Not conceited, but I tell it like it is
Straight up and down because I'm the king of showbiz

[Outro]
