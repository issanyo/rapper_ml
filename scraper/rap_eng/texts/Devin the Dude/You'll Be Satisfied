Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you
Everyday that pass me by
I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you
And you'll be glad at the time

Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you
Everyday that pass me by
I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you
And you'll be satisfied, girl

I know I haven't been coming around like I used to
Been slipping through the corn
Where I thought I was gonna lose you
I keep you mind, I'm going weeks at a time

I wish I could take you with me
Cause I need you around
You second guessing, yes, distressing
Cause I'm going so much

Realize you'll be surprised
How much I long for your touch
Sometimes I look in the skies
Hoping to see your eyes

Somewhere I stare but you're not there
I got thirty two days left but first thing asap
Right when I get back
You'll caress this , I'll hit that

I can't help but, to think
Somebody's holding you tight
And he's got you in his arms
When it's cold in the night

I get upset with just the thought of it
But this my fault of it
But when I get back, you'll gonna get all of this
Until then I'm just gonna keep daydreaming

Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you
Everyday that pass me by
I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you
And you'll be glad at the time

Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you
Everyday that pass me by
I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you
And you'll be satisfied, girl

Every hour that go by, I'm missing you
You know why because you're so freaky
So fine and so fly but you're so tired of me
Being gone so long and I appreciate
The way you stay strong

And hold on for this bond
Cause I'm missing the way that you moan
When I put it in
You know it's worth waiting for

Ain't nothing good in ending this
Things that you say, that you love so much
I'm missing the way you be giving my nuts a rub
I'm at these clubs, looking at these sluts

But they don't matter, girl
It's you who I'm thinking of
And I'll be back in a moment
Go get some more wet
And throw it on the ground

Cause I got some motherfucking crown
It's going down, don't worry about me
Looking at no whores cause soon as I get back
I'm gonna put it in yours until then I'll

Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you
Everyday that pass me by
I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you
And you'll be glad at the time

Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you
Everyday that pass me by
I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you
And you'll be satisfied, girl

Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you
Everyday that pass me by
I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you
And you'll be glad at the time

Daydreaming girl, I'm thinking of you
Everyday that pass me by
I'm gonna get you, gonna stick it in you
And you'll be satisfied, girl
