I wasn't gonna come but now that I'm here
I'm glad I came, the club is bomb
Greens got a big cooler of drank, he gives me some
Then I step to bitches with game we try to run

Up in these hoes, don't even know their name
They have no bra, no panties, they never say no
They just hyper out and go on they way
All the way home

I'll just wait 'cause inside is much too stuffy
Gotta find some pussy
The club don't close till three
And if you're lookin' for me I'll be

Sittin' in front of the ride
Drinkin' and smokin' some weed
Checkin' out the bitches
Tryin' to see what I can see

I didn't know that there were
So many hoes round here
Got a parkin' lot full
And I'll be checkin' out the bitches
Tryin' to see what I can pull

I spotted this bitch that I use to hit
Back in the day she thinks I'm rich
Therefore she feels that I should pay
She doesn't got dick

Nice palm sized tits but there is no way that I can give
Her money for something I get for free
She had no bra, no panties, she's ready to bone
Even stock on her cock or you get ready to bone

I think I'll just wait, that just don't sound good to me
Gotta find some cheap pussy
The club don't close till three
And if you're lookin' for me I'll be

Sittin' in front of the ride
Drinkin' and smokin' some weed
Checkin' out the bitches
Tryin' to see what I can see

I didn't know that there were
So many hoes round here
Got a parkin' lot full
And I'll be checkin' out the bitches
Tryin' to see what I can pull

It's almost nine, it's damn near two
It's gettin' late and that's a sign
Of all the stars out on the chase, niggas be lyin'
Tryin' to win these hoes like it's a race and I don't mind
If I see a nigga all in my bitch face

If she has no bra, no panties
Look like she wanna bone
And it ain't no pain at all
Just go and take that hoe home

And I'll just wait for one of these freaks
To come with me to make whoopy
Find a piece of pussy
My watch says a quarter to three
And if you're lookin' for me I'll be

Sittin' in front of the ride
Drinkin' and smokin' some weed
Checkin' out the bitches
Tryin' to see what I can see

I didn't know that there were
So many hoes round here
Got a parkin' lot full
And I'll be checkin' out the bitches
Tryin' to see what I can pull

Sittin' in front of the ride
Drinkin' and smokin' some weed
Checkin' out the bitches
Tryin' to see what I can see

I didn't know that there were
So many hoes round here
Got a parkin' lot full
And I'll be checkin' out the bitches
Tryin' to see what I can pull
