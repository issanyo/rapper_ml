Hey lady
Is your bus runnin' late?
I see your kids walkin' round with a bag full of groceries, I know you don't know me
But are you goin' my way?

Hey excuse me, I don't usually pick up strangers
But you know it's dangerous out here
You ridin' on a 52
And niggas walkin up they tryin' to get at you
You ain't scared you from the hood, yeah it's all good
They tryna get you in the bed if they could
But I'm offerin' a service, like Uber
First ride free I'll spit some game to you
Tell your kids to grab the bags and get in, I'll take you past 610
Faster than metro, let's go catch ghosts
Find out more about you get more info

Is my truck good enough? Aw shit I think your butt's good enough
