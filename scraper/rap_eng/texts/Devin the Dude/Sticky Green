[Intro: Scarface]
We finna smoke like it ain't no tomorrow

[Devin]
I grab a Swisher Sweet and use my fingernail to cut it
Gut it, then I dump the droppin's out then stuff it
Full of coffee, and if you don't know by now, coffee is killa
In other words, weed a fat dime is a pillar
Now the buds on the stems are like trees in an orchid
Anybody in the room who don't smoke weed is gettin tortured
By the smoke, niggas choke, niggas cough and they fart
Need to quit it but they still tryna hit it too hard
It's the...

[Chorus: Devin]
Sticky green
Frosted leaves
Oh so sweet
I love to blow weed
Sticky green
Frosted leaves
Oh so sweet
I love to blow weed

[Verse 2: Scarface]
It seems to be a, misunderstanding about the cheeba
I see a, sign stating "cannabis stupida"
But I need a, big fat jilla to get me lit
I prefer to smoke the zigzags 'cause Phillies ain't the shit
And I done laced it up with the Bombay, formaldehyde
Anything that you can mix with the spinach. I done tried
I done damn near died 'til I realized straight dutches
If you see me blowin' out smoke, you can bet it's the...

[Chorus: Devin]
Sticky green
Frosted leaves
Oh so sweet
I love to blow weed
Sticky green
Frosted leaves
Oh so sweet
I love to blow weed

[Devin]
Man, gon' on; I don't see nothin' wrong with a little reefer
You got the weed, I got the drank, nigga, just tell me where to meet ya
I'm high, you high, let's try to get higher
Here, use my lighter, set the ass on fire
We blowin' like a choir, everybody's in line
Hopin' they can get they fingers on it one more time
Because there's nothing but a party over here, that's how we do it
Live music, plenty bitches, cold beer, and oh yeah some...

[Chorus: Devin]
Sticky green
Frosted leaves
Oh so sweet
I love to blow weed
Sticky green
Frosted leaves
Oh so sweet
I love to blow weed
