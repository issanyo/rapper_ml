Just Coolin'
Just chillin'
Feeling fine all the time
Just Coolin'
Just chillin'
Feeling high all the time
Weed smoke lingering bitches steady calling me looking for some dingaling
Sun shining had fun rhyming with the brothas
No doubt we got higher than a motherfucker
Zip up the street to get my car wrenched off
I call my gal I know she all pissed off
Check my phone to see all my missed calls
Laws pulling up on me ah shit ya'll
But what’s new in the city of H town
He just telling me to turn the bass down
I oblige like a citizen supposed to
With speedy time to keep his mind off my mota
I ride by the park
When it gets dark then you can spark
But who’s got the time for that
Let me find my sack and roll a baseball bat ya know
Just coolin'
Just chillin’
Feeling fine all the time
Just coolin'
Just chillin'
Feeling high all the time
I’m ripping and running sipping on something
To equalize and synchronize my high
I Gotta keep it playa though
I can’t get too bent at night
I might not be worth two cents
I gotta chill yeah and pace myself
Hold up and don’t try to race myself
Slow down and just take my time
And be able to wake up the next day and say that I’m fine
And I’m going to live my life with the greatest
Happiness I could find with nobody trying to say shit
And try not to give them a reason to trip
Stop by smoke some good weed and  I dip
See I like to keep the peace
I like to have fun since I heard on this earth you only live once
So live it up with whatever you’re doing
And when you holla at me best believe I’ll be
Just coolin'
Just chillin'
Feelin' fine all the time
Just coolin'
Just chillin'
Feelin high all the time
Just coolin'
Just chillin'
Feelin' fine all the time
Just coolin'
Just chillin'
Feelin' fine all the time
