Chapter what? Verse what?
Oh no, no, no, no, not today ladies and gentlemen
I'm here to tell you about Stay Hard
Keep your dick hard all night long

Back in the day they used to call me the sharp shooter
But right now it's all about getting your testosterone level up
Men, how many times you had a problem?
The woman out there with the legs cut open
You looked down and 'lil man ain't around
What you gotta do, fellas, is get your shit together

Stay hard, all night long
Stay up better all evening
Stay hard, stay good
Take it from me and I will lead you to where

Be fruitful and multiply
That's right ladies and gentlemen
By the time you get to my age
Your testasterone level reach so low

You can't look down and see it
Unless you lift your stomach up
But with new stay hard all night long
Oh, you can give it to her, you can give it to her

'Cause tell the truth fellas
You don't just be beatin' that pussy up like you used to
It is brought to you by
Hold up, who this mofoca made by?

Stay hard by who? I don't know
Who made the motherfucker?
Shit, I don't know, you don't know
I don't know who made this

He just told me to come to
Well, go look for in, in
Go look for it somewhere in CBS
Rite Aid, Walgreen one of you motherfuckers got it

Stay hard, keep your testosterone levels up, man
Keep your thing up hard, good and hard
