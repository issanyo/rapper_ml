[Verse 1]
You're constantly askin me for somethin
And when I say no you get mad, and you be wonderin
Am I tryna act funny (no!) about some money
I got you baby, you wanna share it with Sonny
Well it ain't that much, and what I got I really need it
I can't be givin Diana my dollars like Billy Dee did
Keep your own hair fixed, get your own nails done
Make your own money in case I don't have none
But maybe you're hopin I'm a star and you might feel
I'll pay a note on your car or a light bill
Didn't catch it when you asked me did I come in a benz
And did I have enough room for you & some of your friends, but
Then it hit me
You was bout tryna get some money, yup straight bullshit me (no!)
Tryna see what you can get, even though we just met
And you ain't even gave ya boy no pussy yet

[Hook]
But if I asked you to suck on my dick, bitch
Would ya? (oh, no, I can't do that!)
And if I asked you to help on my rent, bitch
Could ya? (oh, no, I can't do that!)

[Verse 2]
You like to smoke all the time
All my weed, ya eyes lower than mine
But shit I ain't trippin, I bought a couple of dranks
To get you drunk, dig in ya pussy and get my knuckles to stank
A couple of bucks for your tank, yeah I'm cool with that
But after I give you this cigarette and you keep askin for shit
I'mma ask you if you think it is a lack of respect
To pull out my dick and put it on the back of your neck
Cuz see these women'll wait, bitches'll beg
And 50, 60 dollars just might get you some head
But I'd rather spend my money on some weed and wine
It seems pussy should be free, ain't no need in buyin it
Why don't you go half with me?
But just like I thought, you was out to bullshit me
Tryna see what you can get, even though we just met
And you still ain't gave ya boy no pussy yet

[Hook]
But if I asked you to suck on my dick, bitch
Would ya? (oh, no, I can't do that!)
And if I asked you to rub on your clit, bitch
Could ya? (oh, no, I can't do that!)

[Verse 3]
Now you asked me to buy you some gear
You said you was tired of wearin the same bullshit all year
Them big ol titties and ass is what you use to catch
Niggas to buy expensive clothes with shoes to match
I'll get some booze and a sack and we can hit the Kings
Flea market shop till we drop, I'll probably get you a ring
Around your collar want some dollars, hell I'll just foot the bill
Give you a new pearl necklace and some polish for your grill
I'm glad that I can satisfy the women with needs
But when you want too much I'll put Jimmy up in you then leave
I got three minutes left on my phone card
Times are tougher than my dick when I'm on hard
Can't do nothin for a bitch who can't do nothin for herself
But you tryna squeeze a nigga until there's nothin left
Tryna see what you can get, even though we just met
And you still ain't gave ya boy no pussy yet

[Hook]
But if I asked you to suck on my dick, bitch
Would ya? (oh, no, I can't do that!)
Or help me to get my transmission fixed, bitch
Could ya? (oh, no, I can't do that!)
