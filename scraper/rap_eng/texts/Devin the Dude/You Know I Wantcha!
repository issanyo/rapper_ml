Sexy motherfucker you
You need to let me bust a nut or two
When you dance, you put me in a trance, as you dip my dick is stiff, when you bend I want to stick it in
Them ass cheeks partin left, right, left
It's hard for me to catch my breath
I wanna grab you by the waist bend you over but now
This not that type of place and yo there go them law
They might trip so I'm a just dip
Go over to the bar and get a couple of drinks to sip
And roll me up some weed right there in the corner
And I be over there with the bar cause I wanna put it up on ya
When you finished with that lap dance right there, come holla at your boy and bring me a light beer
I'ma twist me the motherfucking suede so big
And let you hit it too, as you take a seat on this dick because

It's about damn time
Shit what took you so long, it's time to grind on mine
You're so fine, I know you every man's wish up in here
Look at that pretty hair, look at that derri√®re
You know the beat from the snare, you bounce your ass to the beat
So perfectly thinkin of the cats you gon sweep
When you done, I'm just hopin I'm the one that you choose when you put on your regular shoes

Where you goin girl? Say you gotta go? Hold up hold up where you gotta go? Oh you got an opportunity over there. I see you with your hands in the air. Money everywhere. Oh but you'll be back. Just say you will. My shit is harder still and I be waitin. I be waitin. I be waitin

Forgettin about me you even dance for your home girl
You takin doller showers, I'm waitin by the hour
