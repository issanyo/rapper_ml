[Verse 1]
Another heartbreak torn love, I'm lonely
Get on my laptop PornHub, I'm horny
Oh what a sight, they all look delightful
I want more than an eyeful
Damn which one should I pull?
Caramel thick bitch with the lonesome pretty eyes
Live chat, nah bitch, I want some pussy now
She was more than with it, I guess I'll pass by
So I zip with the code to the Southwest side
The gates slowly opened
Is she quick to lick a dick, a nigga surely hoping
No one's watching as I'm knocking softly with the door knocker
Trying kinda hide until I get inside and fuck her

Apartment 8216
There's a lady who's a big freak
She says she's waiting on me
She say I can come but I can't leave

[Verse 2]
The door opened by itself, I walked in, it closed behind me
The lights went out, I heard a voice said, "Come find me"
Tried to hurry, it was too dark to see
So I tiptoed through that bitch, now where can she be?
I felt a slight slash on my neck like some leather hit me
Then something grabbed my dick, oh shit somebody better get me
Turned around quickly, what the fuck is that
A man-looking woman dressed in black
All bloody and bruised with a pet baboon
Pointing to the back saying, "She's in that room"
I'm like shit, I'm looking for an open window
Thinking to myself, "The fuck I got myself into"

There's a lady who's a big freak

[Verse 3]
There was loud moans and groans, I crept in slow
It sounded like an exorcism when I stepped in that ho
Didn't see the bitch at first but I heard a lady screaming
There was no windows at all and the walls was bleeding
The bathroom door was open, the faucet [?] running
I'm walking towards it but up in the closet something's bumping
Scratching sounding like a fucking loud growl in the wild
Opened it up, four niggas, dick and balls cut off
All four tied up with their drawers in their mouth
And all I could think about was hell nah I'm out
Turned to see where I could flee and instead I saw a ghostly figure
In the bed and then it said, "No you can't leave nigga"
