[Hook: Devin The Dude]
Checkin' out the bitches
Smokin' on some hemp
I'm somewhat of a player
I'm somethin' like a pimp
Yeah
I'm checkin' out the bitches
Smokin' on some hemp
I'm somewhat of a player
I'm somethin' like a pimp
Yeah

[Verse: Devin The Dude]
Now this is how I do it, nothin' to it, grab a gal and go
Tell her we ain't gon' get too serious, oh yeah, she have to know
I'm somewhat of a player, lay her down and let her feel me inside her
She wants guidance I'll guide her
Provide her with the lighter for the sweet I had
Stuffed it full of hemp
Fucked her and walked away with a limp
High as a blimp
A pimp?
Not really, you know, but something like it
See the pussy comes free for me, don't search the streets to buy it
I give a favor for a favor, no hard labor involved
I'm not here to save you baby, hey I gave you my all
I can't give you dick when you demand it
I can't stand to see you stranded without
But there's a lot of coochies going through a drought
So I wet 'em up
I get 'em up outta they sleep
And I shut 'em up from complaining about not havin' no D in they life
As soon as I finish I leave, but they don't mind
Cause they know I got to go and spank some mo' behinds

[Hook]
