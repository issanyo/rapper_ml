Gimme Some



Chorus:

Girl when you gonna (gimme some)
I've been waiting for you to (gimme some)
I was hoping that you would (gimme some)
Don't say no girl (gimme some, I need it now make me feel so good)


Verse 1:

Stop teasing all that hard breathing
Got my dick stiff and you're pulling on it like a stick shift
It gets dry when you constantly rub it
And I would just love it if you would just suck it
I like your company but that's not enough for me
Just put your trust in me, you'll see how good that nut could be
I won't be running round the city tellin niggas how I hit it
Had no Idea how to act a few years back but now I get it
With me and you and what we do I'll keep it confidential
Just say yes and go get dressed girl I'mma come and get you
You're the reason why I'm leaving my old ways
My black book is gone and I done forgot where them hoes stay
And I was just thinking, just maybe, you could be my one and only lady
But I was wondering

Girl when you gonna (gimme some)
I've been waiting for you to (gimme some)
I was hoping that you would (gimme some)
Don't say no girl (gimme some, I need it now make me feel so good)

Verse 2:

Now what you waitin' on debatin' on
Come on lets get our fuck faces on
Pull out my jagged edge make a nice intro
Yeah it's in mint condition and I'll put in slow
And easy, and get you wetty wetty
You'll just love the way I give it to ya girl, if you just let me
(let me make you feel good) let me make you feel good

Spoken:

Yeah I'll make you feel good just like you deserve to feel good baby
I'll do whatever I have to do to please you, you know what I'm saying
I won't just be trying to satisfy me, if I get 2 I'll make sure you get 3
Yeah easy, I'll make you good and greasy
So it'll be (nothing but smooth sailing)
Let me help you moisturize what's between your thighs girl


Girl when you gonna (gimme some)
I've been waiting for you to (gimme some)
I was hoping that you would (gimme some)
Don't say no girl (gimme some, I need it now make me feel so good)


Whistle solo


Girl when you gonna (gimme some), I've been waiting
I've been waiting for you to (gimme some), you've got me hoping that you would
I was hoping that you would (gimme some), don't say no
Don't say no girl (gimme some, I need it now make me feel so good)
