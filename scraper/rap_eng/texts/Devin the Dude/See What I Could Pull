[Verse 1]
I wasn't gonna COME
But now that I'm HERE I'm glad I CAME the club is crunk
Greens got a BIG cooler of DRANK he gives me SOME
And then I step TO bitches with Game we try to RUN
Up in these hoes don't even know their NAME
They have no bra
No panties
They never stay on
They just might put our links on their grill on the way home the way home
I'll just
Wait
Cause inside is much too stuffy
Gotta find some pussy
The club don't close till three
And if you're lookin' for me I'll be...

[Hook]
Sittin' in front of the ride
Drinkin' and smokin' some weed
Checkin' out the bitches
Tryin' to see what I can see
I didn't know that there were so many hoes round here
Got a parking lot full
And I'll be checkin' out the bitches
Tryin' to see what I can pull

[Verse 2]
I spotted this BITCH
THAT I use to HIT back in the DAY she thinks I'm RICH
Therefore she FEELS that I should PAY she done got thick
Nice palm sized tits but there is no way that I can give
Her money for something I get for free
She had no bra
No panties
She's ready to bone
She's got stock on that cock or you can rent it to own
I think I'll just wait
That just don't sound good to me
Gotta find some cheap pussy
The club don't close till three and if you're lookin for me I'll be...

[Verse 3]
It's almost time
It's damn near TWO it's getting LATE and that's a SIGN
Of all the dogs out on the CHASE niggas be LYIN'
Tryin' to win these HOES like it's a RACE and I don't MIND
If I see a nigga all in my bitch FACE
If she has no bra
No panties
Look like she wanna bone
And it ain't no pain at all just go and take that ho home
I'll just wait
For one of these freaks to come with me to make whoopy
Find a piece of pussy
My watch says a quarter to three
And if you're lookin' for me I'll be...
