D.E.V.I.N
Tryin' my luck
Tryin' to see what I can do
See what I can come up with
Shits in my head
Eyes red I'm high
The weed I have is like the weed back in the day times five
And you see that's all I need
Yup a brotha get high
Score a zip, roll a splif and pass that other shit by
I'm smoking while I'm creeping
Before I get there
When I'm leaving
The only time that I'm not chiefing is when
I'm eating or I'm sleeping
While the bitch next door at the motel room
Calling downstairs talking bout that ho smell fumes
But the manager gets high he told her that he'll go check
Damn near broke his neck
Running up to the room to smoke this shit
When I'm stable it's on the table
Don't take it when I travel
They love me when I get there
There's plenty gifts to unravel
I baffle the minds of workers at the laundry mat
They think my clothes been worn by a walking ganja plant
But my job requires me to smoke all day
And if I'm caught with no weed
They'll let me go with no pay
So I lay out on the couch
Scratch my nuts on my days off
Hoping I don't get laid off
Cause I'm kinda short a weed
Can I please buy a quarter
I oughta by a whole fuckin pound
Need to bring the price down on that shit
HYa hit it just a lil' bit and get my
Dooby out the ash tray
Smoke like it's my last day
Breathing, indeed I lead by example
Hit the cannabis cup
To see what weed I can sample
Let me look at the menu
Nigga throw a dime to me
Damn that got some shit they call porcupine pussy (Let me smell that shit)
Get the torch
Head to the porch
Light it up and hit it till it's down to a roach
My seventeen year old son I told him leave it alone
But when he's eighteen he grown we might go half on a zone
But he choose not to use and I'm, glad
I hope at last
So he won't be
Poking in my stash
Smoking grass
Since the tender age of thirteen
It was dirt green
But still in the morning first thing
We would, spark it up
Get high, everybody, spark it up
Especially on Fridays
I'd be higher than the muthafucka
Walking through the halls
See niggas on speed
Niggas bouncing off the walls
I pause for a minute
Nah nigga keep dipping, keep flipping
Got some more (cough) cough and sipping to do
Holla at you muthafuckas in a few
To catch him it might just take awhile
It's hard to hate his style
As he glides through the crowd
Making the ladies smile
