Chorus

Smoke it 'till its all gone
Chorus

Smoke it 'till its all gone
Smoke it 'till its all gone

I'm always chokin' but steady smokin' the herbal gets me open
Through the clouds a floatin'
The smoke is thick I'm losin' focus
Incase you didn't notice this niggas head stays the blowest
Thats why we get it and hit it then pass it, you wanna hold it?

And see my homeboy grows it and brings it to the hood
Take a wiff (Damn that smells good)
Well it should! I payed enough for it
I bought a whole quarter pound and that was yesterday
But now I'm down to a dime

I tell you what you bring it to my crib let me saaample it and exaaaamine it
The night is young the freeze gon' come
We outta weed why dontchya tell me where I can get some so we can..

Smoke it 'till its all gone
Smoke it 'till its all gone

Lets go half on it pinch in on the sack
Put in the hat fill in the gaps pinch yo wrap gimme some dap?
Eenie Meeny Miney my eyes are tight and shiny
So if I say or do somethin' crazy just never mind it cause..

Weed is all natural I'm glad that it grows
Makes me cool with my friends never mad at my foes
Yo, you thought that was some shit when they blew up the towers?
Man let them hoes fuck with Budwisers

I said I can't control it
Go get my bong and reload it
Put some Peyote I light it hit it hard and I hold it
And then cough a couple times cause its certified potent
I keep a "?" so grab a sweet and start rollin'

Smoke it 'till its all gone
Smoke it 'till its all gone

We used to roll perfecto when we stole from Truckzillo
Now the weed we get is so good we rollin cigarillos
Sorry Mr. Ciga I didn't mean to split knee
And empty out the tobacco and I stuff it with green
And then I'm coughin' and slobbin' but steady bobbin' my head
Frost eyed and mushed mild but you heard what I said
And my eyes look like I've been swimmin' in the pond
For about 3 or 4 hours with no goggles on
Got hoes to get their goggles on to finish what they started on
And they'll give you what you need
Tell them hoes to bring some weed
Until then we gonna continue to get higher
I got exactly what you desire
Now thats some fire

Smoke it 'till its all gone
Smoke it 'till its all gone niggaaaa
