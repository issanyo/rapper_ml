[Verse 1: 14K]
Didn't care about the money, never asked for a dime
Said you only wanted my love and my time, yeah
Lookin back it's so funny, I thought you'd always be mine
I guess that's why I damn near lost my mind
When you were out of touch, nowhere to be found
When I needed you most, you were not around
In my own safe world, thought that I was holdin it down
Thinkin that love was all I need to keep you around

[Hook: 14K]
I wanted you so bad (wanted you so bad)
Shoulda been careful (I'm so naive)
Lookin for love with my heart on my sleeve (my sleeve)
You told me forever (told me forever)
Now I know better (now I know better)
Now I know that your kinda love ain't for me

[Verse 2: 14K]
Didn't care about them groupies, know how crazy this job can be
No they didn't have nothin on you, so they could never have me
I thought that we were somethin special
I thought that you could really understand me
I thought a lot of things, but now I see
That you had other plans, for this love of ours
I was wrapped up in your lies from the start
This is a whole new game, didn't know you were playin so hard
Didn't know we were playin for my heart

[Verse 3: Devin the Dude]
I thought you was all that, I gave you the ball and the bat
You gave me your glove, I thought I was saved by your love
I stopped drinkin, stopped hangin with the fellas
I tried to do everything to keep you from gettin jealous
I thought I was on the right track
I turn my back, and you do a nigga like that
Now I know that your kind, be so fine
Then get what you want and then you pay a brother no mind

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Devin the Dude]
Yo, you had my nose wide open, door stayed closed
To my heart, let all the other broads know
That I was taken, but I was sadly mistaken
I was givin you the beef while you was sneakin some bacon
And I, didn't know you had such good tricks
Thought we could click, we took trips, took pics
And I start fallin in love a lil bit
But that was before, now I know you on some bullshit

[Hook]

[Bridge: 14K]
(ohhhhh) Never felt so empty
(ohhhhh) I can't believe I let you in
(ohhhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhhh) Can't believe the pain I'm in
(ohhhhh) But I learned a lot from you
(ohhhhh) Now I know what not to do
(ohhhhh, ohhhhh) I know better than givin my heart away

[Hook]
