As I lay down on this beat, I pray that my soul release
All of the answers that people need from me, deep in me
Hopefully I can clear the air
By layin it in this verse
And shut all the gossipin cause I put in a lot of work
Just to improve my ways
And show how much of me changed
Preoccupied a lot of times, just tryin to do this rap thang
I've gained a lot of legitimate dope, from lyrics and beats
To where I don't care about, what you gotta say about me
You think I'm trappin, I'm practicin actin, picking up different hustles
Keepin a clean slate, so I'm so far away from the struggle
Prepped for you chitta-chatters, and bloggers on websites
Who wanna go to war with words but ain't got their money right
My priorities are in line, consistantly on the grind
You waitin on my downfall, you'll be waitin a long time
I'm surrounded by real niggas, go gettas, and go git it
That share the same dream I share
When we make plans, we down with it
My unit move like we religious, teaches in packs
And make sure everything we do is intact
So muthafucka fall back
And let the chips fall where they may
Cause I'ma continue to represent that One Four K
In every way, and every day, until the lord calls me home
I'm gonna keep doin this until I'm gone
Fuck you, you think I'm dead Wrong
Then trust me I don't wanna be right
Cause I've been through the stormy weather, chasin after the sunlight
Cause I know, I know
(Devin the Dude)
People talk, they lie and look, they gossip and shit, that how their time
Is took
Keep doin ya thang, don't rest your case
You fucked up before, but don't trip on the mess you made
Keep goiiin, You'll get there

Ya'll don't know the half of it
You can get satisfaction
I'll make it I'll get to actin
With words instead of action
You want lets get it crackin
Go on with the yappin
Cause gosspin like a bitch, will get a bitch slapped
Swag so dash
And words so outlandish
Personality smashin
Outspoken to madness
White tee blue fitted
With the stripe matchin
Gets a lot of tail
While you leavin with a passion
My time ain't here for waistin, but makin paper lets git it
Man I take your opinion, and I wipe my ass with it
My past is somewhat shady
Maybe sometimes I was crazy
Lately it's been fuck you pay me
Baby that shit there don't faze me
Daily, I be bout my bread
I spend more time gettin head
Than I spend, walkin round, worrying bout some shit you said
Ain't nothin picture perfect
But I don't explain myself cause really, I don't think It's worth it
Cause you gon feel how you feel, regardless of what I say
And look at something good about me in a bad way
My people say I'm the shit
My kids say I'm the king
My fans know when I get behind this mic, dog I do my thang
And if I did give a dam, bout a whispin as nigga
It just ain't no way I could be out here fakers
You busy tryin to light my matches, now your life in ashes
I'm just tryin to get ahead, while you worried bout me crashin
