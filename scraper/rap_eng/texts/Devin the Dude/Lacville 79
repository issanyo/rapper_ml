Barely runnin and rippin, but still I'm flippin on Vogues
Hoes be trippin on Devin, Devin don't be trippin on hoes
And they be talking bout, oh would you look at that nigga
With no inspection sticker, drankin liquor, smokin swishers
And I go about 47 in a 55
Fuel injected niggas be honkin but fuck it my shit is fine
I've paid for it 'bout 9 times, different mechanics
Too much of a job, some say they just couldn't handle it
I need some shocks on the back, I need some works on the brakes
My passenger side window sometimes it just don't wanna raise
I hear bumps and crunks, pings and ticks and dings
I got a hole in my muffler and other minor things
Like my electrical rear view mirror don't move like it 'posed ta
Even the objects in that mothafucka need to be closer
I'm satisfied with my ride I don't ask much
But people talk and they diss, they heckle and laugh, but

I'm rollin
Car not stolen
Probably never will be it's much to old and
Smokin weed and feelin fine
In my Lacville 79
I'm rollin
Gas runnin low
But I try to keep it white and Vogue's stripes golden
Hopin freaks will get inside of my Lacville 79

I got my toolbox, got my booster cables, and jack
I get where I'm goin, two quarts of oil will get me back
I got a brand new radiator
Rebuilt alternator
Detachable tape player
But I gotta fix the fader
So I can have some music on the 610 loop
Maybe fit in with the L-Dogs, sedans, and coupes
Need to watch out for them laws cuz you know they gon watch ya
With their radar gun, look like they shootin as they clock ya
And the whole force know me
For years they been scopin
They walk up to my car and be like "hello Mr Copeland"
"Gimme some of that weed you got" sometimes they don't ask for it
They know where I keep it, they reach right under my dashboard
And that really blows my high but hell I gotsta keep pushin
Before I go home have to nut off on my seat cushion
I went looking for a trade-in but they called my shit a bucket
Got back in that ho, and cranked it up and said fuck it

I got my hubcaps shinin
(I'm) in that bitch reclining
The engine shakes a little cuz I gotta change the timin
And if you see me walkin (I'm) givin it a rest
She needs some new shoes, and getting fitted for a dress
You know I love my baby hell I call my baby Pearly
She got mad at me this morning, woke her up too early
Just to go across town over on Chimney Rock
Had to pick up a bitch who wanted to give me the cock
I got over there real cool and picked her up all good
But half way to the hotel smoke start coming up from the hood
Me and the bitch had to push and she didn't even get mad at me
Figured out the problem made her go steal me a battery
Now lavishly

[Hook x2]

Lacville 79
I'm rollin in my
Lacville 79
I'm smoking in my
Lacville 79
I'm getting blowed in my
Lacville 79
Took 2 hits there
I can't get rid of my Lacville 79
