Ooooooooooooh!
Ooooooooooooh!

[Devin the Dude]
Well, hello again!
My weed-smokin' friends, I'm glad you came
With coffee / Coughee in your cups, if I went up
I'll do the same
And you can pass it to someone you've never met
And let 'em get just as high as you
You're eyes red as shit - mine, too!
We about to start the show
Who got an Optimo?
A swisha suite
A zig-zag and bitch that'll kiss my meat
This cordless mic, I know what they like
Continue to rockin' the show that'll slow up a fight
And I know of dyke
Who wouldn't mind
Gettin' some of this dick from behind
But, I'm gonna chill, y'all
Cause she might wanna start wearin' my draws

[Devin the Dude] (Tony Mack)
And oh noooooooooo! (And oh nooooooooooooo!)
Don't want that shit to happen! (Don't want that shit to happen!)
(Ooooooooooooooooooooooh!)
Get it twisted just because I'm rappin' (Get it twisted just because I'm rappin'!)
Don't want that shit to happen!
(Oh nooooooooooooooo!)
Don't get it twisted just because I'm rappin'
(Don't want that shit to happen!
(Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!)

[Devin the Dude] (Loni)
Admirin' my weed jar, it's rather stocky
At the crib, how about myself lookin' at hockey
And wonderin' who's gonna win The Cup
If it was full of coffee / Coughee
I know the brothers will man up, I'll stand up
Together, drank, and then I get a call
(Can you come over so I can lick your balls?)
Well yes, I guess!
Let me shampoo my nuts and get dressed
I'll be there in 20 minutes
Mission complete, I hit the street
With the suite, some heat
But fuck - there's some cops on the beat!
And there's some crooked laws
That'll pull you over and dig all in your draws
And...

[Devin the Dude] (Tony Mack)
And oh noooooooo! (And oh nooooooo!)
Don't want that shit to happen! (Don't want that shit to
Happen!)
Get it twisted just
Because I'm rappin'
(Don't get it twisted!)
(Ooooooooooooooooooooooh!)
(I don't want that shit to happen!)
Get it twisted just because I'm rappin'

[Devin the Dude]
5:30 PM, I'm at the lab again
Another song, about to take another stab again
Drinkin' and laughin'
And puff-puff, passin'
And to and fro'
While, I'm constructin' my flow
And pick up some hoes
Up in this motherfucker!
Hey, what cha wanna do, girl?

[Loni]
I don't wanna tease you
I just wanna please you
And lick you from your neck to the top of your dick
And then rub my clit and grind my hips

[Devin the Dude]
Oh! That sounds like some pretty cool shit!
But damn, might get full of weed and alcohol
I go to sleep and you try to dig off in my wallet
And in my draws and...

[Devin the Dude] (Tony Mack)
Don't want that shit to happen! (Don't want that shit to happen!)
Get it twisted just because I'm rappin'
(Don't get it twisted!)
I don't want that shit to happen!
Get it twisted just because I'm rappin'
(Don't get it twisted!)
Don't want that shit to happen!
(Ooooooooooooooh-ooooooooooooh!)
Don't get it twisted just because I'm rappin'!
Don't want it! Don't want it! Don't want it!Don't want that shit to happen!
