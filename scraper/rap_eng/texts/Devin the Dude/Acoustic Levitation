Acoustic levitation
Complete separation
Acoustic levitation
Please take me away from (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Too much aggression
I deserve the best
I can't be tripping on this shit
I need my mind at rest
I wish I could hear something
To lift me up and away
Phonically and ultra-sonically
Bring me back in one day
But it's raining
I can't avoid the winds and floods
What used to be all grass is nothing but mud
I'm up to here with it
But I gotta deal with it
Shoot a vein, do a line, pop a pill, quit it
I take a walk and then I spark
And let the music take me
Somewhere I've never been
When I return it's all gravy
You know, all my problems less strenuous
Being overwhelmed and upset
I can't continue this
I need space and there's a lot out there
Yo, but where should I go, I don't care
I'll just roll a square and put it up in the air
Take another hit and play my music yeah (yeah)

Complete separation

Please take me away from (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Up out of here but I'll stay in touch
I used to joke and laugh but now
I don't play as much
'cause days are much colder
Somewhat dimmer
I smoke and toke and hold onto the feelings I remember
But the time keeps kicking
Ain't no turning back
You gotta do all that you can to keep your life on track
Me too (me too) so I must see it through
Be true, weed and brew helps me keep cool
And, avoid the fight and fussing
Hopefully one day I can say I don't need nothing
Just living off life and what it brings to me
Flying high with the birds as they sing to me
Moving far and beyond
They say "what he be on?"
Traveling faster than light
But I'm far from neon
I try to stay grounded, look for a piece of mind and I found it

[Interlude]
You got more time to free your mind
Oh me oh my
You'll be so fine
You need more time to free your mind
Oh me oh my
You'll be so fine

[Verse 3]
Serenity is out there
So go find it
If it helps get your favorite song
Play and rewind it
Even though the climate
Might get hot and humid
You gotta have the attitude
That I can do it
Because He who strengthens me
And lifts me up
Got all kinds of blessings
And gifts and stuff
Way more than enough
So get yours and don't lose it
Imagine how high you'd get
After you use it
Music do this to me
Oh wee it soothes me
Right down to the doobie
Like Shannon, let the music play
Let the sounds take me away by way of

Complete separation (oh yeah)
