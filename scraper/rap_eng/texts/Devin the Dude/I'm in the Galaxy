[Hook: Roe Hummin]
I got the finest weed
I got the quality, yeah
'Cause I'm in the galaxy
How can I live and breath, yeah
Then fucked around and got so high
Then got so high

[Verse 1: Devin the Dude]
Stand by for takeover
I'm about to blast away
Fire up and break north up into the galaxy
Just one hit of this shit and you feel just like I do
[?] myself like I'm swept away by your typhoon
Right through the Stratosphere
I'm glad its here, this big ol' bag of weed
Imma twist one up, light it, pass to you, you pass to me
Maybe grab a drink or two, I think I'll get a beer
And everything that brings me down just seems to disapear
Getting high, steady climbing
I hope nobody's trying to find me
Break you off a little something something
You'll wonder where this shit come from

[Hook: Roe Hummin]
I got the finest weed
I got the quality, yeah
'Cause I'm in the galaxy
How can I live and breath, yeah
Then fucked around and got so high
Then got so high

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
All I need is good weed and I'm cool, man
(That is really nice and for that price you can't beat it)
Approven medicine that really soothes pain
(I stay weeded, I take as needed)
This shit right here can make the whole world high
They won't legalize it I just don't know why
Until they do, Imma just take it slow
Lay low and stay blowed

[Bridge: Devin the Dude]
Yeah, stay blowed, stay high... Musically that is, acoustically that is...

[Hook: Roe Hummin]
I got the finest weed
I got the quality, yeah
'Cause I'm in the galaxy
How can I live and breath, yeah
Then fucked around and got so high
Then got so high
