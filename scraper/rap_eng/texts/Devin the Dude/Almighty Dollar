Verse One:
Seventeen dollars all to my name
I had to spend two went to got me a drank
At a sto' fo' mo' for a box of squares
I seen a fine bitch I had to stop and stare
It was hot and she was walkin' in the scorching sun
I said, "Get in pretty girl I don't want you to burn."
She said she lives across town and needed a ride
I would have took her but this gas is too highhhhh
I kept flippin'
I kept dippin'
I can't be wasting my time
Went to the tre for a dime
Now, I got a dollar left
Might as well give it to somebody else, I can help
Tried to hand it to a brother
He said, "Man, you need more than this mothafucka"

Chorus:
The almighty dollar
It ain't what it used to be
Hobos used to asked you for a dollar
Now the motherfuckers ask you for three
The almighty dollar
Well that's what they used to say
One dollar used to be a whole lot, but it's hardly worth shit today

[Devin talking]
Well shit, give me my dollar back nigga
When I'm in the tre I might as well go buy T.S.U
See what these fine girls do around here
Go by Frenchy's and smell me some chicken or something
Damn, what are all these helicopters and shit doin' around this mothafucka?

Continue my journey with the AC off
Smoke rushin' out the window every time I cough
I swang to the right and let the police pass
The nigga tryin' to get away, them laws on his ass
But I'm glad it ain't me
Aw naw, not now
I'm tryin' to rise, tryin' to climb
Don't want to fall back down
So I put the sweet out and wait until I arrive
Treat it like an hour later because I'm already highhhhhh
I had no need for fronting
Ain't even try to be funny
Nigga got to have money
Some of us love it
Some of us hate it
Some of us need it
Almighty dollar

Chorus
Outro:
[Clerk] Hello. How you do?
[Devin] Yeah what's up man? Let me get ah, two cigarillos
Two gallons of gas, and these two Budweisers right here
[Clerk] Oh, two Budweisers. Fifteen dollar
