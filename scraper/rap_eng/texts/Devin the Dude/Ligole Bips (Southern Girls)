[Chorus: Devin]
Ligole bips, tiggo bitties and nipples
Tiggo bhighs, wide gap in the middle
Ligole bips, tiggo bitties and nipples
Tiggo bhighs, wide gap in the middle
(She’s my Southern girl)

[Verse 1: Devin]
Man, if I could build me a bitch, I would
She probably wouldn’t look good, from head to foot
But she would have biggo lips and nice palm-sized titties
Let her get petite and freaked by all niggas
Give her thick, firm thighs, silky smooth like cocoa
That makes you wanna hop up in that cot and go loco
Turn her jaws red, baldhead, shit, I don’t care
I don’t ever remember askin’ a bitch for no hair
Like that hoe over there with the big ass and flat stomach
She’s pale, but what the hell, she’ll still make my dick vomit
Never hate or discriminate, don’t have to think or decide
If she black or she white, it’s all pink up inside

[Verse 2: Jugg Mugg]
And down South, something about the way they shake that ass
I’ll straight take that ass, make me wanna rape that ass
But nah, I’ll treat ya good if you all good
You see, but keep them grubs cooked and my dick hard as wood
Southern gal, I love it; always hug it and rub it
And you always got my back when I get to some trouble
And when you’re rollin’ shotgun in my car blowin’ dirty
Your head disappears and my car starts swervin’ from them…

[Chorus: Devin]
Ligole bips, tiggo bitties and nipples
Tiggo bhighs, wide gap in the middle
(Southern girl)
Hot ass whips, she’s a mean sick heffa
Bobble these galls, she’s a bad futhamucka
Ligole bips, tiggo bitties and nipples
Tiggo bhighs, wide gap in the middle

[Verse 3: Rob Quest]
I want a girl to go (“uhh”) while I be pokin’
Got the nerve to turn around and be coachin’
While I’m strokin’ and rub some lotion on her
Crunk attitude is off the hook, mash the gas
Run around town with her drawers in her ass
Yeah, I see you with your flip-flops, listenin’ to hip-hop
But when I ‘m broke and bummy, you come with the siznock
A six-shot, cocked, nonchalant, just fills the blunt
You won’t diss her, you might even kiss her
I could be your weed, just let me be your Swisher
You make me wanna lick ya (Ah, nah, nigga)
But she’s cornbread fed, plus beans and rice
Twice as nice, no other type will suffice from those…

[Chorus: Devin]
Ligole bips, tiggo bitties and nipples
Tiggo bhighs, wide gap in the middle
(Southern girl)
Hot ass whips, she’s a mean sick heffa
Bobble these galls, she’s a bad futhamucka
(She’s my Southern girl, yeah)

[Verse 4: K.B.]
I got a big pot of greens and a half-pound of okra
A six-pack of brew and a bitch fat as Oprah
The pussy poker, I take ‘em 200 and over
Then bend ‘em over, whether I’m drunk or sober
See, a big girl, she won’t complain about shit
Just dick her down and wake up to sausage, eggs, and grits
It ain’t hard to please her—now it’s on you, pimpin’, eat her
But I never miss a meal and that big bitch won’t either

[Verse 5: Devin]
My señorita, she’s call me “negrito”, I call her “jota”
“El grande panocha”, we both smoke mota
‘Posed to hook up at six, and man, this bitch thick
She got five freaky friends that’s quick to lick dick
What time is it? Almost 5:30
There’s a knock at the door—there they go, them hoes early
We don’t have to get ‘em hot—they ready to do damage
Just lay ‘em on they back and fix a titty-dick sammich
They wit’ it—they know there’s no chillin’, no hangin’
They love dick and nuts and they’ll stick the whole thang in them…

[Chorus: Devin]
Ligole bips, tiggo bitties and nipples
Tiggo bhighs, wide gap in the middle
(My Southern girl)
Hot ass whips, she’s a mean sick heffa
Bobble these galls, she’s a bad futhamucka
(Southern girl)

(She’s got some) Ligole bips, tiggo bitties and nipples
Tiggo bhighs, wide gap in the middle
(Southern girl)
Hot ass whips, she’s a mean sick heffa
Bobble these galls, she’s a bad futhamucka
Ligole bips, tiggo bitties and nipples
Tiggo bhighs, wide gap in the middle
