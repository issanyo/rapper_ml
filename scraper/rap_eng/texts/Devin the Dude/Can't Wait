(Chorus)
I can't wait 'til you get out my brotha
It's hard to put it in a letter and say
But I'll be here when you get out my brotha
And do my best to help you live in better days

What's up man
I don't know if this letter's gonna reach ya before I try to come see ya
I'm not too busy but things been kinda happenin for me
I been meetin new people, my nigga, and some of 'em love me
On the road, toatin my fiddle, in the middle of June
I took a lot a pictures, I'm gonna develop 'em soon
Family is cool, I talk to mama, she chillin
But until you get out bro', you know how we feelin
Here in the free world, it seems a much better place
But I tell you one thing man, it ain't that safe
Shit be happenin for a reason but I don't ask why
Some niggas get shot, some go to jail and some die
But if you wonderin do I miss ya, then ya know I got to tell ya, yeah
And if you was wonderin will I be waitin for you when you get here, yeah

(Chorus)

Some like twins more than friends, I couldn't picture me without ya
Don't know what to say when niggas from back in the day ask about ya
They ain't forgot ya and I think about the past I remember
Us break dancin for lunch money, breakin in shit for dinner
I tried to write once in a while, I don't know where to start
Thinkin about how the system tore us apart
But you got a good heart and better days are yet to come
So when they let 'cha go we gon' make sure that you get you some
Tell them brothas 'stay up' that's with you in the pen
And wish me luck on this race, chunk you a few if I win
But you'll be out by then, we'll be able to help each other
God bless, I love ya, and brotha
If you was wonderin do I miss ya then you know I got to tell ya, yeah
And if you was wonderin will I be waitin for ya when ya get here, yeah

(Chorus)
