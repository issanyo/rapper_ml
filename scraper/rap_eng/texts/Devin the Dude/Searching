(Shit, I don't want none of that shit man. I'm chillin')
Well ah, I do. I'll take one, I'll take two, I'll take four

[Verse One]
In the forest, in the summer time
I'm hunting, with this gun of mine

[Chorus]

Searching, waiting, looking
(For what?)
I don't know
I don't know

{Verse Two]
I'm passed out by the river side
Was it the meth, or the formaldehyde
That had me

[Chorus]

Searching, waiting, looking
(For what?)
I don't know
I don't know

[Verse Three]
Another planet, another day goes by
Another one of these, and look how high I fly
Cause I

[Chorus]

Searching, waiting, looking
(For what?)
I don't know
I don't know
