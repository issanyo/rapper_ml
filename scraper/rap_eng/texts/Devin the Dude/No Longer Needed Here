[Hook]
So you say you need some time
To find yourself and free your mind
I can see it clear
I'm no longer needed here
Say you need some time
To find youself and free your mind
I can see it clear
Im no longer needed here

[Verse 1: Devin the Dude]
Gave you damn near everything
You wasn't no hoe to me
Protected and provided for you
Cause that's how it pose to be
But now all of the sudden you want independence
Don't say where you're goin you'll just be back in a minute
So I just say fuck it cause you always had your freedom
Go and find your friends if you really need em'
To feel good about yourself and give your spirit a boost
They fuckin over their men hell you might as well do it too
Go find that fountain of youth, that fantasy life
Where you don't have to work on it to make it right
I never meant to bring you down
You grit your teeth and you frown whenever I come around
And I guess you had enough, packin up leavin
Throwin in the towel for no apparent reason
But I'll be aight in the wind as I ride
Thinkin bout the times when you were by my side

[Hook]

[Verse 2: GT]
No matter what I do for you girl it ain't enough
I helped you raise some bad ass kids and bought you stuff
You know, food to eat money for daycare
I helped you pay your rent sometimes and I don't even stay there
But who cares we suppose to be one
Late night smokin purple watchin Sanford and Son
That's how we use to get down now we fuss and we fight
Cause im always in the studio, the club every night
You wanna do what your friends do
And hang where them hoes hang
I'd rather be alone bitch I'm through with this whole thing
I'm doin my own thing so you should do the same
Stop blowin up my Nextel cryin ain't' nothin changed
Makin up excuses to leave that's old game
You ain't gotta make excuses to me just go I won't complain
You want the train or the bus I'll call you a cab
And you can hand me back my keys to my Jag
