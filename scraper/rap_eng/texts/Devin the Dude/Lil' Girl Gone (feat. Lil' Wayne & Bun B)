Ok I'm talking bout a
Good girl gone bad
Crooked world wrong pad
Right mom wrong dad

I sing this song mad but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up like some bbq from Luther's
In the morning with the boosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the freshcut and they're on her like sutures
And I wanna talk to her
But her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better
She's the weather of my future

I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain
Trust me I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an oncoming train
Stuck in the passenger seat
Trying do the fast lane
Damn...

Little girl gone somewhere out done stranded
Can't nobody find her and they don't understand it
She was raised good can't blame her parents
Lost in the sauce is not the way they planned it (x2)

Well once upon a time there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter two story house two car garage
And a white picket fence wrapped around the front yard

See daddy was a doctor
And mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced
So now mommy's drinker

Daddy had a malpractice suit
Now he's a snorter
And all this shits takin place
Right in front of their daughter
She says, "Daddy what's wrong?"
But he's just too high
"Mommy what we gon' do?"
She just get drunk and cry

Caught in the middle of two wrongs trying to do right
Looking for answers alone in the darkness of night
That shit ain't tight

Little girl gone somewhere out done stranded
Can't nobody find her and they don't understand it
She was raised good can't blame her parents
Lost in the sauce is not the way they planned it (x2)

Couldn't even fold her own clothes yet she chose to jet
This is shit she will always regret
Now she's runnin from house to house out and about
All hours of the night
Learning hard lessons of life

She called home twice but she couldn't say
Where she was gonna lay her head the very next day
She gave up her body and mind way before time
Got nothing left to dug out and get help

She doesn't know what to do with herself
Her family's worried think she don't even care
(Don't even care)
She's livin up her life
On a hope and a prayer
Where she'll end up in a few years who knows where
(Who knows where...)

Little girl gone somewhere out done stranded
Can't nobody find her and they don't understand it
She was raised good can't blame her parents
Lost in the sauce is not the way they planned it [x2]
