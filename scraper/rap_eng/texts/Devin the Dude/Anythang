Anythang is plenty man and is better than an nothin at all
Anythang is plenty man
Anythang is plenty man and is better than an nothin at all
Anythang is plenty man

You ain't the only one who got problems
You ain't the only one who knows pain
Get up off your ass and just solve them
You still got a chance to try to change - try this shit again

[Refrain]
Really ain't no need for self pity
Cryin when there's no one else around
Life I know sometimes can get shitty
Even shittier when sleepin on the ground - no need to complain

[Refrain]

You ain't the only one who got problems
You ain't the only one who knows pain
Get up off your ass and just solve it
You still got a chance to try to change - try this shit again
Really ain't no need for self pity
Cryin when there's no one else around
Life I know sometimes can get shitty
Even shittier when sleepin on the ground - no need to complain

[Refrain]

Nothin at all - nothin at all - anything is plenty man
I hope you realize that everybody gonna need somebody sometime
Anythang is plenty man and is better than an' nothin at all
Anythang is plenty man..
