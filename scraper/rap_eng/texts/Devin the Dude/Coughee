(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Devin the Dude]
Hey muthafuckas, guess what I got?
I just came from the spot and I scooped up a pot
Of this good coughee, I got it right up under my hat
It's in a brown paper sack, it's a dime and it's fat
Pass me a Swisher so I can twist a
Nice fat muthafuckin' spliff for ya, mister
Shit, 'cause I'm ready to get wired up
First I lick the leaf and I tie it up
Get the lighter and fire it up
But bitch, when you get it don't be tryin' to hit it hard
So you cough and you choke  and you slob and you fart
Fuckin' 'round with my coughee, bitch, you better be cautious
'Cause ho, you know I roll big old horse dicks
To keep you blowed, higher than giraffe nuts
I spend my last ten even if I need a haircut
My girlfriend trippin' out, she don't understand why
I come in fucked up every night and I

[Chorus: Devin the Dude & (Odd Squad)]
Drink about two or three cups in the mornin'
(Bitch, get off me, I gotta have coughee)
I get high so I try to keep a whole pot on me
(I gotta have coughee)
So if you know where to get a fat dime, bitch, I want it
(Bitch, get off me, I gotta have coughee)
Just go and get the weed, ho, I got five on it
(I gotta have coughee)

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
A nice good cup of coughee, somethin' for your head
I keep a sack on my back just like Juan Valdez
At your door in the morning, ho, get up, roll a square
I got some weed that's guaranteed to make your eyeballs bleed
Not a dime this time but a nice sized quarter
We call our shit coughee but we don't dip it in that water
It's just straight weed, muthafuckas, no sugar, no cream
Save all that shit for all them old school dopefiends
This dedicated to my fellow coughee drinkers
Like Corey, Dexter, Kevin, Keith and Chris, I'd like to thank y'all
For comin' by the crib when I'm broke to get a nigga full
(Smokin' that weed) and drinkin' Schlitz Malt Liquor Bull
'Cause when I rap, that's all I need
And a friend with weed, now that's a friend indeed
Yo, and since I'm unemployed and every day is my off-day
I kick off my shoes and I booze and I choose to drink coughee

[Chorus: Devin the Dude & (Odd Squad)]
Two or three cups in the mornin'
(Bitch, get off me, I gotta have coughee)
I get high so I try to keep a whole pot on me
(I gotta have coughee)
So if you know where to get a fat dime, bitch, I want it
(Bitch, get off me, I gotta have coughee)
Just go and get the weed, ho, I got five on it
(I gotta have coughee)

[Verse 3: Devin the Dude]
I know your breath get stank (uh-huh), your throat get dry (yeah)
But I like gettin' high, bitch, I'm blowed right now
I got a brew in my hand, Lil' James can't understand
Why we stumblin' through the studio drunk again
Drinkin' coughee, eyes red, tight and shiny
When the laws get behind me, yo, my nuts don't get tiny
I just reach up under my seat and get my heat and get 'em off me
'Cause they took my driver's license but them bitches can't have my coughee

[Outro: Devin the Dude & (Odd Squad)]
(Gotta have coughee)
Oh, I gots to have coughee
(Gotta have coughee)
I said I gots to have coughee
(Gotta have coughee)
Don't fuck with my coughee
(I gotta have coughee)
Oh ho, you know I'm finna go
And score me some mo'
And I'll be back in about an hour or so
With some coughee
(Gotta have coughee)
What a nigga need is some coughee
(Gotta have coughee)
Good ass weed, coughee
(Gotta have coughee)
Gotta have coughee
(Gotta have coughee)
I said I gots to have sess
(Gotta have coughee)
I gots to have skunk
(Gotta have coughee)
I gots to have indo
(Gotta have coughee)
That shit ain't no punk
(I gotta have coughee)
He ain't talkin' about no goddamn Maxwell House...
