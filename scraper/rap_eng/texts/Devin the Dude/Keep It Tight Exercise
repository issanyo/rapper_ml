Yeah
Don't try to put me in the class
With the rest holding
On your sex until
I pass your little test
I have no time for that
I have a quiz of my own
I used to hit it and gone
'Cause of the bitches I've known
Who used to get what they want
After sucking a good dick
And when they feel they satisfied
They slag it up and they split
I got sick of their games
They got sick of my lies
Got sick and tired
Of trying to give her some time
But nobody wanna be lonely
The rest of their lives
Either leave it alone
Or let's get it right
And if I had a chance at love
I sure wouldn't mind if
That love would be yours girl
'Cause you're so fine
But that's just a part of it
Gotta know where your heart is at
'Cause I'm a finis it if I started that
And I don't wanna waste your time
But if I could make you mine, I bet you
I'm gonna do you good
I'm gonna treat yoU right
Like a grown ass man should
But you gotta keep it tight
I'm gonna take you everwhere
Show the whole world I love you
I'm gonna do you good
Treat you right
But you just got to keep it tight
Keep it tight baby
You know what I mean
Make sure it fit like a glove
Smell good, squeaky clean
And I'll be back in a week
So don't be hard to find
I hope you ready to see me
And this rod of mine
And all the time is yours
If you want it to be
But, I gotta know you only want it from me
Then we can do things, move things
Fly all new blue planes
All around the world
Me and my girl chuchu trains
And all the things
And the shit you wish to do
Horseback riding and after that
I hit you with the mule
Share thoughts together
Share quotes together
Grow love, something to share
Long walks together
Whatever whoever however you feel it
It will just be me and you chillin'
And I don't wanna waste your time
But if I could make you mine, I bet you
I'm gonna do you good
I'm gonna treat you right
Like a grown ass man should
But you gotta keep it tight
I'm gonna take you everwhere
Show the whole world I love you
I'm gonna do you good
Treat you right
But you just got to keep it tight
And I know it's hard to trust
When temptation is surrounding all of us
Plus you get horny when I'm nowhere to be found
And it seems to me it's guaranteed
You're gonna play around
But maybe that's just my
Guilty conscience thinking nonsense
I wanna be the only one to get
All the hunches from you
I like what you do, and
I like the way you go out of the way
To satisfy me to and girl whenever you need me
I'll always be right there
Just give me all your love and girl
I promise I will go nowhere
You're so fine you should be mine
And all the time I treat you right
Whatever you want whatever you need baby
Day or night
I'm gonna do you good
I'm gonna treat you right
Like a grown ass man should
But you gotta keep it tight
I'm gonna take you everwhere
Show the whole world I love you
I'm gonna do you good
Treat you right
But you just got to keep it tight
Keep it tight, squeaky clean girl
I'm gonna do you good
I'm gonna treat you right
Like a grown ass a man should
But you gotta keep it tight
