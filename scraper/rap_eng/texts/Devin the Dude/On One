(Verse 1: Bun B)
Baby your love is like a drug
I need it like a fiend
Every time I get it, it's got me gone like a fiend
Every time I hit it, it's like the best dro
And every time I'm with you I don't wanna let you go
See I don't think you know
How much you got me sprung
I'm walking around pacin' acting high strung
Try to go to sleep
But when I lay up in my bed
All I do is toss and turn to get you out my head (out my head)
It won't give me no peace I can't rest
Waking up in deep sweat shirt sticking to my chest (to my chest)
I feel it deep up in my stomach
And no matter how I try just can't run from it (run from it)
It's like an itch you can't scratch
Waiting on the chef to come through with a fresh batch (fresh batch)
I'm trying to keep it together but
I'm feeling like I'm going to need you forever
You got me on one

(Hook: Deven The Dude)
When I give you a call you don't answer your phone
When I pass by your house girl you're never at home
I'm doing everything I can just to leave you alone
Cause it's like
And everywhere I went man I was looking for that ho
I'm going crazy it just ain't fair
I'm in the streets looking for you everywhere
People stop and they stare
But I just don't care
Cause it's like
And everywhere I went man I was looking for that bitch, oh shit

(Verse 2: Gator Main)
Hey why you never at home
Why you never answer your cellular phone
Who that little bitch in front doorway
I'm gonna tell her you gone
How she know where I stay anyway
Hey what the hell are you on
I'm in the 5-50 bumping my (?)
With a lil' yellow bone watching my television
She in love with a nigga but she just won't admit it
Look why you playing hard to get?
Why you just want some niggas
We in Kansas City
I'm the man in the city
I'm (?) in the city
Say god dammit she pretty
I'm a sucker for hookers
But don't be tricking no dollars
How bout we gather our children off in a little country cottage
And this coupe with no mileage
Plus my passenger (?)
Now we way down in Houston with ambassador Bun
I'm an ace in the hole
Your nigga a rapper with guns
I'm the jack of all trades
And bitch he the master of none

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Devin The Dude)
I saw your friend the other day
She acted like she knew something I didn't
Then she turned around and started grinning
Like I was the butt of a joke
The last to know
Started to ask where you were
She acted like she had to go
Quick, birds of a feather I guess
I'm cold and sick, but nevertheless
I'm aight, can't sleep at night
I turn and I toss
Call you cellphone, but you turned that ho off
So I pace the floor
I can't wait no more
I try to find you but you know I won't chase you though
Now I'm going through some withdrawls
Without you I've gotta go and settle for some big drawls
And all I want to do is get another dose
I tried that other shit but you know what I love the most
I plug your hole if you let me
But you got me feeling all lonesome
Yah, I'm on one

(Hook)
