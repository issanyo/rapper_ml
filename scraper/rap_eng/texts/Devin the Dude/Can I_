[Chorus]
Can I be the one you can't turn down and won't say no?
Can I
Can I be the one you're waiting for?
Can I be the only one with the key to unlock your door?
Can I
Can I be the one you're saving it for?

[Verse 1]
Can I be the one next to you in the morning
When you wake and see the sun
Can I be the man that
You've been looking for since your heart's been stranded
Abandoned, broken, left unattended
I do my Al Green thing, how can I mend it?
I won't be back and forth like tennis
I'm in it 'til the finish, feelings never diminish
Yo, I'm kinda private though
'Cause if everybody know
They'll put it all off in the streets like a sideshow
And you know I like to travel
But you don't have to worry you'll go everywhere that I go
As long as I know

[Chorus]
Can I be the one you can't turn down and won't say no?
Can I
Can I be the one you're waiting for?
Can I be the only one with the key to unlock your door?
Can I
Can I be the one you're saving it for?

[Verse 2]
No promises, I'ma just do my best
Previous I was devious, wasn't true I guess
Now I'm a brand new man
I learned to stand through rain
Learned to give and not to wait for folks to hand you things
I could come to you give wherever you be
Or you could run to me like S-W-V
Couple of my friends saying that you're trouble to me
But shit, how can you help it when you love what you see?
I know you got choices
In your ear alot of voices
Tell them niggas to hold they horses
'Cause I'm here my dear, girl
And I ain't gon' leave 'til I see girl, can I

[Chorus]
Can I be the one you can't turn down and won't say no?
Can I
Can I be the one you're waiting for?
Can I be the only one with the key to unlock your door?
Can I
Can I be the one you're saving it for?

[Chorus]
Can I be the one you can't turn down and won't say no?
Can I
Can I be the one you're waiting for?
Can I be the only one with the key to unlock your door?
Can I
Can I be the one you're saving it for?

[Outro]
The one baby with the key to your heart
