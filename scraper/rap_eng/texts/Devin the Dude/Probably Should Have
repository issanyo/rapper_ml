[Verse 1]
I didn't come, I didn't call ya
Matter of fact I forgot it was your birthday
I didn't check my messages
I guess I was drinking, was thirsty in the worst way
I didn't realize
That you wanted me just as much as I want you
I tried to get between them thighs
You asked me to wait, but I just didn't want to

[Hook]
Probably should have, when I could have
Spending time worrying when you gon' put out
Thinking with my third leg with my foot out
Now I'm sitting round here in this shit house

[Verse 2]
I forgot to thank you
For all the things you done for me
I didn't bother to help you
With your rent when you asked me for a G
I can't be played a fool
That's what I thought -- you was all about money
Now you with another dude
I want another chance, but you don't want shit from me

I didn't tell you how much I needed you in my life babe
I didn't tell you how much I care for you
But I...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And you were gone, I was all alone
I met a girl, she was fine and submissive
She was cool, she wasn't you
She only fuck, didn't cook, didn't do dishes
But that ain't what it's all about
Realized she was just like them other fake bitches
Slamming doors and throwing shit in my house
And now she's cutting up my shit, man what the fuck is this!!??
I sometimes think of you as I toss and turn at night
Now you're gone with someone else
And I lost the yearn to fight (probably should've treat you right)

[Hook]

[Outro]
You know, most of my time is pretty much thinking of you
I even look at the pictures we use to take
Realizing that I made a huge mistake
I wish I could turn back the hands of time
I'll do a lot of things differently
Respect your body and your mind
So I can have both at the same time

I didn't tell you how much I needed you in my life babe
I didn't tell you how much I care for you
But I...

[Hook]
