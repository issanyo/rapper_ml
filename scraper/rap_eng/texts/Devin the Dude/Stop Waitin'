[Devin the Dude]
It's so hard, living on the streets
No table to food to eat, no shoes on your feet
No shelter, felt in the air
Nobody going your way, so you don't think you going nowhere

[Chorus]
Waiting, waiting to die
Stop waiting, waiting to die

[Devin the Dude]
I know it's hard, when inside you have a sore
And you don't come out no more, cause they haven't found a cure
And you don't allow, all your friends to come around
And now they talk behind your back, and you always feeling down

[Chorus]
[Devin the Dude]
I know it's hard, to be living all alone
And there's no idea that, when you may get home
And you feel, like nobody cares
Best believe, there's someone who's there

[Chorus - 2x]
