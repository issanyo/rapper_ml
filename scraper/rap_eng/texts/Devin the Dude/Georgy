[Verse 1:]
It was a cool afternoon, the first day of school
Everybody wonderin' who's the new dude
With the Kangol sneakers with the wide shoe strangs
Wonderin', wonderin' where he from and how he do thangs

His eyes stayed red but he kept his mind clear
The brothers knew he wasn't from nowhere 'round here
And the girls kept whisperin' in each other's ear
It seems they didn't care about the smell of the beer

They were all on his thing, a couple of 'em tried to grab it
Takin' their chances didn't know of his bad habits
A two timin' cheat and quick to make up a lie
Just to be kissin' the girls and makin' 'em cry

[Chorus]
Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry

Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry

[Verse 2:]
The girls didn't take caution when they was flossin' wit Georgy
Porgy turn a simple party into an orgy
And just when they thought that they was the one that he chose
He get rid of them quick and get some more

Just when they thought that they was the one that he chose
He get rid of them quick and get some more
Just when they thought that they was the one that he chose
He get rid of them quick and get some more

No time for lames it's a shame what he do to women
His mouth spit game like a snake shootin' venom
And after he hit 'em some claim that he's no good
But they stick wit' him guess the pain feel so good

Take, take what he can get givin' up nuttin' why
He don't think that he should pay for the puddin' pie
Takin' em, breakin' em, fakin' em out
He just be kissin' the girls and makin' em cry

[Chorus]
Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry

Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry

[Verse 3:]
He kept a girl on the side, he keep one at home
And those who wasn't smart they couldn't leave him alone
He'd pick one of 'em a different one, yep, each weekend
Undressin' em, caressin' em, kissin' em, freakin' em

But last Friday night, oh, this what I heard
Outside his driveway parked a Thunderbird
Georgy couldn't hear nothin' but the headboard knockin'
Looked up and saw a strange woman in the window watchin'

Didn't know if it was Tina, Tanea or Toila
But whoever it was they had a gray revolver
They asked no question, just start bustin'
George was in shock couldn't say or do nothin'

He just laid there stiff lookin' froze
And all he could think about was I got too many hoes
In the bed wit' no clothes, just waitin' to die
Just for kissin' the girls and makin' em cry

[Chorus]
Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry
