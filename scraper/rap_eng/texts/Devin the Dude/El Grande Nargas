Tu esta muy bonita

[Verse 1]
Hey baby, you sure look mighty fine when you walk my way
Say lady, I sure wish there was something I could say
That booty, I truly wish that I could speak your language
Cause I really don't know how to explain it

[Hook]
Oooh, bonita, tu tienes el grande nargas
Oooh, bonita, tu tienes el grande nargas

[Verse 2]
So mannish, the thoughts that goes and stops inside my head
My spanish, it's so bad I don't know what the fuck I said
Excuse me, senorita I'm just tryna find the words
To let you know I like the way your booty curves

[Hook]
Oooh, bonita, tu tienes el grande nargas
Oooh, bonita, tu tienes el grande nargas

[Interlude]

[Hook]
Oooh, bonita, tu tienes el grande nargas
Oooh, bonita, tu tienes el grande nargas

[Verse 3]
So authentic, the way you move those hips when the music plays
All off in it, I'll groove if I could be with you today
"No comprende," is all I get when I ask you to dance
I really wanna feel what's in them pants, girl

[Outro/Chorus]
Oooh, bonita, tu tienes el grande nargas (ai ai ai baby)
Oooh, bonita, tu tienes el grande nargas (oh yeah yeah baby)
Oooh, bonita, tu tienes el grande nargas (ai ai ai baby)
Oooh, bonita, tu tienes el grande nargas (oh yeah yeah baby)

[Ad-lib]
(ooooh)
Ai ai ai, I like to look at your nargas
To take a grab, to get it around and squish it in my hands
You make me want to hoochie-coochie with you girl (ai ai ai)
