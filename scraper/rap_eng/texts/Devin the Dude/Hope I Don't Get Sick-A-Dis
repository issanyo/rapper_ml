[Devin The Dude: crooning]
Oooooooooo-Ooooo
Oooooooooo-Ooooo

[Verse 1]:
Devin not devil or no demon how uneven
Weed & cigarrs, brew in the seat of the car
Who can it be other than coffee brother D
I cut a sweet with my finger
Choke a bitch with my dick then walk up the stairs and hang her
Who can get they thang sucked while they boo boo?
- I can, by a chinese bitch who just fixed the moo-goo-gai pan
I stay high man I guess thats why a motherfucker smile
Feedin these hoes dick Fuddruckers style
A buck wild bitch I like her
Other hoes might try to fight her
I be tip-toein through texas
Even got bitches in ryder
Ask me do I know a ho named so and so
I might've ask her did I nut quick or was it one of them all nighters?
I like dick lickers and ball biters
And honey dips who dont trip if I dont write her
I be kickin it
Stickin this dick off in these bitches
It's gettin ridiculous
I hope I don't get sick of this

Oooooooooo-Ooooo
Oooooooooo-Ooooo

[Verse 2]:
I'm just flippin, ridin, slippin, slidin and shit
Don't try this at home
Cause see me be high in the bitch
Phone rangin man I got my choice of 2 hoes
Which one should I choose
Shit you know how it goes
I choose both now we on the other side of town stylin
Niggas mean muggin but im still smilin
Cause one bitch is playing with the other bitches titty
Cat hanginÂ´ out im like ''here kitty kitty''
Every city and state
Them hoes fix me a plate when I arrive
Then I open up they thighs
And I be amazed myself sometimes
How I can get my dick raised with just one rhyme
I started off horny with a hobby
But no longer have to hub around the hotel lobby
I be kickin it
Stickin this dick off in these bitches
It's gettin ridiculous
I hope I don't get sick of this

Oooooooooo-Ooooo
Oooooooooo-Ooooo

[Verse 3]:
Rumblin and tumblin
Why theres no need
I rather look at the fight
Sit back and roll me some weed
Me and my niggas we be lookin for hoes to conjer up
Catch em in a group we swoop and ask them do they wanna fuck
And if they sleazy then its easy of course
But if they lady like we gotta control our voice
You know: Our volume, our pitch, our tone
And if she still don't give you no pussy
Tell the bitch gone on
As the beat goes on the heat goes on
Lil' sweetie excuse the booze it belongs to me
Im known to be pretty horny
Fuck you in the mornin
While you yawnin you'll feel this dick going in
Pushin', Jugin' but it don't irritate
No force no court no need to letigate
Kickin it
Stickin this dick off in these bitches
It's gettin ridiculous
I hope I don't get sick-a-this

Oooooooooo-Ooooo
Oooooooooo-Ooooo

Oooooooooo-Ooooo
Oooooooooo-Ooooo
