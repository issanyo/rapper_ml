[Hook: Devin the Dude]
Do you love gettin' high?
Touchin' the sky
Do you love smoking weed?
Are you just like me?
Do you love gettin' dough?
Don't give a fuck who blows ya
Do you love gettin' high?
Touchin' the sky


[Verse: Devin the Dude]
Puffing a j
Up, Up and away I go
I'm fucked up but hey
There's nothing to say
They know as I float above
The clouds gone with the wind
Above the trees, the breeze
Got me uplifted again
Taking me places I never visited
Soon as I hit this shit
I take flight
Point and look they might
So what?  (heh)
If you think I'm tore up
But I do what I wanna do, ain't no fuckin' robot
Just a clever brother hover over mountains & buildings
Smokin' herb against this turbulence got me bouncin' & chillin
Willin' to venture to places unknown (unknown)
Well, as long a nigga can make it back home
To see the people that I care for, show em what I'm there for
Cherish the precious times & leave again to go grind
But still, make the best I will
I'll just roll me up some kill & I'm chill (I'm chill)
