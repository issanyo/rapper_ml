If she come on home with a thong on I'ma get her
Man the party is lit and I know that you hear me
All that I'm yellin is give me the money cuz a nigga hungry
And I need it real swiftly
It ain't about the business nigga please it's irrelevant
Got some other things I could do with my time and it would be better spent
