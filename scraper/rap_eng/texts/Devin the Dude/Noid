[Chorus: Devin the Dude & Snoop Dogg]
Oouuwee, this weed got me paranoid (so ‘noid, so ‘noid)
Oh shit, the effects hit me so hard (so high, high, high)
It must be full of cannabinoids (cannabinoids, cannabinoids)
Please sell me a quarter, how much you want for it? (sell me some) (how much you gonna charge?)

[Verse 1: Berner]
This shit got me sleepwalkin’, we don't sleep often
Three bags on the table cause I need options
What is that? I think I smell a seed poppin’, shit
Where the hell you been? Weed shoppin’ (you trippin’)
You can smell it through the bag I took a dab
And now I’m stuck and I don't wanna leave the pad
(I’m just chillin’) And while my heart beatin’, can you hear it?
I’m paranoid, I’m lookin’ out my rear view mirror (I'm in my rear view mirror)
TSA, they got the eye on my bag
But I forgot, I’m Big Bern and they don't care what I have (they ain't trippin')
They wave me thru take a pic and then they give me a dap (what up)
I hit the G- pen on the plane then I take me a nap (I'm out)
The lemoncello’s so good that I keep every batch (I keep it all)
But you can grab a QP, just throw me a rack (I need a G)
Them Scotty bags get burned, we got plenty on packs (we got it)
And becareful on my line, I think my shit is tapped (paranoid)

[Chorus: Devin the Dude & Snoop Dogg]
Oouuwee, this weed got me paranoid (so ‘noid, so ‘noid)
Oh shit, the effects hit me so hard (so high, high, high)
It must be full of cannabinoids (cannabinoids, cannabinoids)
Please sell me a quarter, how much you want for it? (sell me some) (how much you gonna charge?)

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
Been smokin’ weed since back, way back
Rollin’ up a sack, lookin’ at Pat Sejak
But I haven’t felt like this in a minute
Who grew this new shit and what did they put in it?
Feelin’ like a midget, oh my bad, a little person
In the sky, high, tryin’ to fly with no rehearsin’
Man, I only felt worse than this when I’m on that liquor
Come on, boy, have a drink, hey fuck it nigga
Got to get blowed, quick, why waist time?
Double shot of Jose got to chase mine
What the fuck is this? I’m so high
How much should I buy?, Fuck it give the whole thing
Me and my niggas stand in line like soul train
Smoke all night like propane cacaine no mane
I can’t sabotage my stuff, this weed got a nigga paranoid enough

[Chorus: Devin the Dude & Snoop Dogg]
Oouuwee, this weed got me paranoid (so ‘noid, so ‘noid)
Oh shit, the effects hit me so hard (so high, high, high)
It must be full of cannabinoids (cannabinoids, cannabinoids)
Please sell me a quarter, how much you want for it? (sell me some) (how much you gonna charge?)

[Verses 3: Snoop Dogg]
This year Thanksgiving fell on a Tuesday
It’s my world, motherfucker, fuck what the rules say
All black clouds like it’s your doomsday
Married to the game, so this is what the groom say
I’m so motherfuckin’ ‘noid right now
Good thing that I’m hangin’ with my boys right now
All the way to Heaven with Devin and Berner
I got my dope sack off of 11th and Verner
And it's a cookie pack
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah I took it back
See I’m a veteran, nigga you a rookie pack
Look at that nigga right here, and those bitches over there
And all of that smoke that’s floatin’ in the air
Yeah we ball and pop
On my block you better not call the cops
No matter what you thought or what you’d seen
Hid my dope so I can get away clean

[Chorus: Devin the Dude & Snoop Dogg]
Oouuwee, this weed got me paranoid (so ‘noid, so ‘noid)
Oh shit, the effects hit me so hard (so high, high, high)
It must be full of cannabinoids (cannabinoids, cannabinoids)
Please sell me a quarter, how much you want for it? (sell me somethin’) (how much you gonna charge?)

[Outro: Devin the Dude & Snoop Dogg]
Shit
Oh Lord, paranoid
Oh yeah
Shit
Oh Lord, paranoid
Oh yeah
(so high)
(sell me somethin’)
