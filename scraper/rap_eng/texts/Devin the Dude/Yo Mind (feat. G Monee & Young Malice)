You thinkin' nobody care and you're in it by yourself
Takin' anythin', steady destroyin' your health
And it's almost 2 and you on ya ass
Lookin' at the clock, watchin' opportunity pass

You got a few ends, so you order some friends in
As soon as they come in you ready and willin' to spend
But back in the day you used to stay broke

And you had no friends because they laughed and they joked
And poked fun at your shoes and clothes
Now you got a house full of booze and hoes
And anything goes with no house rules
You need to stop, you about to lose

Yo mind, don't you just go and throw it all away
Yo body, don't you just go and throw it all away
Yo future, don't you just go and throw it all away
Yo money, don't you just go and throw it all away

I see you're car hoppin' late nights, workin' the graveyard shift
Could use a lift up out this hellhole you're trapped in
See your reflection flicker in that syringe
Flashback, so when your life was on the right track way back when

You was the homecomin' queen, now you the neighborhood fiend
Do anything, there is nothin' that you haven't seen
Your kids prayin' one day you could get clean
And kick the habit, leave it all behind before you lose

Yo mind, don't you just go and throw it all away
Yo body, don't you just go and throw it all away
Yo future, don't you just go and throw it all away
Yo money, don't you just go and throw it all away

Chasin' dreams might be your only chance, you better make it count
Second guessin'll leave you assed out
Real life's a blessin', stressin', guessin' the best route
I'm still like if it don't feel right then it ain't on
If it don't fit don't force it, it don't belong

I been blessed and all of my drama forever gone, wishin'
Just wishful thinkin' whether I'm right or wrong
Listen on my mama whenever I'm all alone
All I hear is what don't kill you make you motherfuckin' strong

Proof's in the truth, so don't be scared to pray
For your family, friends, and enemies every day, hey
Might sing the blues cause shit that you go through
Or make you crazy and confused but don't you lose

Yo mind, don't you just go and throw it all away
Yo body, don't you just go and throw it all away
Yo future, don't you just go and throw it all away
Yo money, don't you just go and throw it all away
