[Verse 1 - Devin the Dude]
Yo
Who's next in line, who wanna rhyme
One at a time please
Devin you know him, he show 'em
He throw 'em a poem in Chinese
Soothing the dame, brewing in pain
Cruising the fame, doing this thang
"Say dog you moving that cane"
"Hell na its just music man"

[Hook - Devin the Dude]
I hit the highway
Living en vogue / Ripping up shows
Kicking the flows
And I end up with my dick up in hoes

[Verse 2 - Devin the Dude]
Cigarillos
Stuffed with a pillow
Of some killa for real though
You better inhale slow
You want the funk you know where to get it
You know every day we working
The coffee's in the pot
And its perc-ing / People
Peeking reefer leaking out the door
And the neighbors all
About to call the laws
All because our behavior
I mean please
We got papers that states
We can smoke any time
Which was signed by the mayor
I say no to the coke
And in '04 I put the pill up
When my pressure starts to build up
My weed sack fills up / and

[Hook - Devin the Dude x 2]

[Verse 3 - Dee-Rail]
Laguardia to Concordia
A long way from the border / I got a
Phone call they said, "yo can
You help us rock the delta stock?"
I said, "no problem whatever you need
But theres a fee some liquor and weed
A couple of Gs guaranteed
Free / and a room key
I soon be in your area
Code / If I choose to fly"
To my rules they complied / I
Left that very same night
Right

[Verse 4 - Dee Rail (Devin the Dude)]
As I
Exit the plane / A
Sign reads baggage claim /And I
Need to Get the shit / I brought
With me so that's my aim / As I
Stroll out / the door into
My friends car we roll out
Distribute ten beers from the backseat
And blowing the bowl out / to get
High filling my whole mouth
With smoke choked a little bit
Blaming my cough on the bong / cause
That bitch was really hitting / I arrived
In the state of mind / to
Slay two broads I got four
Got on the stage and got love
Then got of the stage and got more
Broke the mic like a cops car
The crowd was like, "we want more!"
That's the life when you on tour
Its not the Cadillac with chrome rims
Its more like transition / From
Being kids to grown men
Now I'm back in the studio / all
Red eyed and zoning / smoking
Sipping dranking tipping / tickling
Women trying to take off their clothes
All I do is spit a verse and
I end up with my (dick up in hoes)
Its a free man's life
I'm living in a bachelors heaven
4:20 on O 7 and I'm on a track with Devin
Now lets go
