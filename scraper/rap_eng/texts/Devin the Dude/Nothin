Life is like the weather
Everything will change
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing stays the same

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Nothins really real
Nothins what it appears
Nothins what I feel
While I'm wiping the tear
Nothin is something here
In the space where the gravity is gone
Where the weight is not so strong
Fall
Still it all amounts to nothing
Nothin in your ear
Nothin I can do to not disappear
Nothin is something here
So I repeat and dissect the prior years
Smoking weed and drinking beers
Getting numb, let it breath

Rhyme-wise I drew the figure eight
There's nothin I regret
Nothin I won't make straight
She told me save those tapes
Cause my life is logged in them
Hidden within the words
Buried inside the rhythm
I said sure
Not knowing that's the last we'd speak
She fought it hard
But eventually just chose to sleep
Back to nothin
Though somehow, something lingers behind
Imprint in my mind, broken bloodline
Time
And I can still see her there
Cooking in the kitchen
Feeding us with all her pampering
Now there's nothin there
It vanished into air
So I said goodbye
Let her go; let her die
Mother please don't cry

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I feel the nothin getting stronger every minute and inch that my fangs grow
A stain that won't fade or erase if I change clothes
They handed me prescriptions as if like the pain goes
But I always found the best medication was laying low
Or was it now?
I've been so high up in this fucking cloud
I don't allow myself to ever mention coming down
Broken halos, hanging out in the underground
I down another round just hoping I can find a little peace

I wake up again to find my pillow soaked
This shit is tragic
Shit even I took Xanax when the widow spoke
And yeah this life can seem a little broke
But I still muster up the nerve to smile wide and say hello folks
Step up and jump into the masquerade
Break the barricade, and you too, can see this world in anime
Some days my heart skips beats
Some days it doubles up
Some days, I'm in a daze
From trying to clean this rubble up
But I keep sweeping, through the weekend
Hoping I reveal the reason, for this breathing
By the end of the season
I hear the echoes of the passed on
So I keep smiling, cause I know they can't
You tell me that that's wrong

[Hook]
