Get yours yeah

[Verse 1: Berner]
Half these dudes ask, why we living in a rush?
How I make half a ticket off shit I didn't touch?
Coke and crazy girls have me used to living plus
I used to pull up in the clutch with blocks hidden in my truck
Yo this fast life'll have your mind going crazy
You got girls but mines all pay me
Underground kings like pimp, 10 pack in the air
FN, dirty mad like Flynn
I play the rap game too, smoked out with the best
I'm out west on October shit, cost much less
I'm on the east coast flexing, counting money with Cam
I keep my heat nice and clean so my gun doesn't jam
I paid the law off too like Pablo and 'em
Anyone, anywhere, I gotta hollow for them
For real, this good smoke got me further than blow
I bust a 50 pack down right after the show, you know

[Pre-Hook: Devin the Dude]
You tryna get more, nigga it's time
Gotta get yours, gotta get mine
To anyways to get paid
Everyday, fuck what them niggas say
You tryna get more, nigga it's time
Gotta get yours, gotta get mine
To anyways to get paid
Everyday, fuck what them bitches say

[Hook: Devin the Dude]
Get yours yeah
Get mine yeah
Get yours yeah
Get mine yeah

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Man I still fuck a hoe, I love the dough
Kill 'em, I got more bills than buffalo
In the bank I got comma after comma, blood
We should count like, "Hmm, let's ponder that"
I got Toya, I got Wanda and Teyana rack
But on the weekends I be freaking up in Shauna's shack
She try to go raw, woah where the condom at?
I'm on birth control, nah I don't honour that
I'm not a lame no, I'm not a young fella
I don't go outside the rain without an umbrella
Let's roll some cookies up and get another high
My life different, come and see the other side
Wiz overdoses, some other nigga die
At the dealership getting another ride
I'm a made nigga, man I made niggas
And I let the homie fuck my maid nigga

[Pre-Hook: Devin the Dude]
You tryna get more, nigga it's time
Gotta get yours, gotta get mine
To anyways to get paid
Everyday, fuck what them niggas say
You tryna get more, nigga it's time
Gotta get yours, gotta get mine
To anyways to get paid
Everyday, fuck what them bitches say

[Hook: Devin the Dude]
Get yours yeah
Get mine yeah
Get yours yeah

[Verse 3: Devin the Dude]
Better get it while you can
But don't count it 'til you got it in your hands
Then spend it wisely man, that's easier said than done
Cause in a couple of months, it can go from bread to crumb
Some niggas punching the clock, some niggas hustle the watch
Niggas getting it by all means and not
Been many years, many beers, many peers gone
I'm still strong, just hoping that I live long
And life right, maybe rich and famous
Well unless rich and famous means dick and anus
Don't look at me, I don't know who their name is
I guess that's how the game is, I don't expect to change it
Just tryna get it one time while I spit you warm rhyme
That'll bring you sunshine in the rain
And I ain't hating on nobody, if you get it then you got it
Ain't no problem, shit get yours mane

[Pre-Hook: Devin the Dude]
You tryna get more, nigga it's time
Gotta get yours, gotta get mine
To anyways to get paid
Everyday, fuck what them niggas say
You tryna get more, nigga it's time
Gotta get yours, gotta get mine
To anyways to get paid
Everyday, fuck what them bitches say
