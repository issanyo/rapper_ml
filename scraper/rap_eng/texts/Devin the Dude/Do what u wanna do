Hallelujah Kids hear this
Devin's got some shit I wouldn't give a fuck if you dissed
Because shit to each is own and each own is voice
You can be stealin' killin' chillin' or whateva your choice

Smoke some weed smoke ya pipe fuck it, life is how you live it
I grab tha mic while tha dj groove it turntable scratch noise
Explicit lyrics is what I'm known to kick
Trying to make money so I can make honeys blow on mah dick

I go on a quick mission to find some kill
Ain't no big deal, just hop in tha Seville
Mah homey put me down quarter pound for a bill
I wake up in tha morning and I have weed still

And I chill with tha brothas sippin' coffee
Too old to be listenin' into what you say so hoe get off me
You're born in this world by ya self and you die alone
So as long as ya grown ya might as well gone and just

Do what tha fuck you wanna do, go ahead and just
Say what tha fuck you wanna say

But what does it all mean? Say what you want hoe ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you
So do what tha fuck you wanna do

Now everybody's got elders and you should respect em
They been through similar shit but then again you can't let em
Put they hands on ya life like a remote control
Have you travelin' down tha same bumpy tore up road

Now close friends and relatives they should be constantly by ya side
And understand you gotta let ya conscience be your guide
There'll finally come a time for ya self you must decide
Cause you only get one ticket you might as well enjoy tha ride and just

Do what tha fuck you wanna do, go ahead and just
Say what tha fuck you wanna say

And there's a couple of fucked up man made rules that we should follow
But you gotta realize that you just might not wake up tomorrow
And tha dollar you earn is tha dolla you spend
Go get sumthin' for ya kids or buy a bottle of gin

Is it a sin? I don't, don't know, what X and O's in this game
Tryin' to survive, tryin' to get high, tryin' to get by and stay alive
So, do it till ya satisfied, not just a lil' bit
But don't wait until ya eighty and start sayin' what you could have did

But what did it all mean? Say what you want hoe ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you
So do what tha fuck you wanna do

Do what tha fuck you wanna do, go ahead and just
Say what tha fuck you wanna say

Do what tha fuck you wanna do, go ahead and just
Say what tha fuck you wanna say

Do what tha fuck you wanna do, go ahead and just
Say what tha fuck you wanna say
