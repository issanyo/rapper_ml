[Verse 1]
Either by bus, plane, train, fifteen passenger van
Another show, then we must go
Let's get there fast as we can
We just trying to spread love when we coming to your city
Some look at us shitty but some bitches show us they titties
So I love my job
Don't have to piss in a cup
They tell me to straighten up because of all the kids and stuff
Are gonna be there looking at you perform
So keep your lyrics calm
They might be there with their moms
And pops, you need to drop something clean with no cussing
But my shit is, but nothing, don't wanna hear these parents fussing
Bout your filth flarn filth and you holding your crotch
Nobody wanna hear bout what you wanna poke in they mouth
But that ain't what it's all about, I'm simply trying to have fun
Tryin' to break a leg, preferably my third one
Up in your back, they ask how can you stand there proud
And bow knowin' there's a little child in the crowd
Sayin'

[Refrain x2]
Who is the man, Momma
On stage with the brew in his hands, Momma
Don't you think he's being rude to the fans, Momma
Grabbin his nuts, look at him doin it again, Momma
He's doin it again, Momma

[Verse 2]
You got to give the people
Yeah I know, somethin other than just pussy, alcohol and reefer
You must uplift the public
And they'll give love back
Like just last night I got my nuts licked
Ugly bitch in love but she hugged it and she rubbed it
Fine big red ho, but now my dickhead sore
And we got another show in the O - Ohio
It's kinda nice
I been there once and got my dick sucked twice
Me and my penis and my microphone
Are working hard so I can get my lights back on
Most people don't understand all the problems, pressure and pain
They criticize and try to make you feel less of a mane
But look at these balls, they're so big
The hairs on em look like two big old afro wigs
No need to get alarmed, I don't mean no harm
If you got your kids with you and they tugging your arm
Saying

[Refrain x2]

[Verse 3]
Man, whatever happened to groups like Manhattans
And the Spinners and Temptations and stuff
These new muthafuckas right here
They just wanna fuck and cuss and
Look at em up there smoking weed
Aw, what's wrong, pops
I mean, you act like you never had the Temptation
Of smoking a little weed down in Manhattan
Drinking a beer, boning a bitch you know
While you Spinner around, you know
But maybe you never smoked bud like I smoke bud
Maybe you never felt as high as I felt
Me and my Coughee Brothers just keep blowing and blowing and

[Verse 4]
If you got some shorties, could you make em stay home
Unless they wanna see some grown niggas shaking they bone
I know it's morally wrong, but see I'm known
For passing Doobies to my Brothers, get my Family Stoned
I'm Gladys Knight-time, the Right Time to get high
We reaching for the sky on Earth
There's too much Wind for the Fire
We out here in the parking lot, knocking out the last corners
Of drink we had since yesterday from somewhere at Arizona
We wanna be Kool, we're not a Gang, just trying to hang
With the people and drink, and maybe exchange slang
We love music and we need the fans, need touring
But one thing we don't need is bad-ass children
Saying

[Refrain]
