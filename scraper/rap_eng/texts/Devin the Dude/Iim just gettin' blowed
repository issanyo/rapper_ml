Yeah, blowed, yeah...

[Devin the Dude]
The hear-say, the talking the chatter
Gossip and the rumors, see to me it don't matter
I barely go out, and if you ever see me
It's probably at a grocery sto', but not on TV
Cause when I get high, I get hungry so I cook
Go get some weed and, open a book
Of papers, if I don't have a cigar
Hold up, wait I got some blunts in the car
Mad dash right back, with the fresh box of swishas
(oh I thought you said blunts), cigarillos what's the difference
It's bout what you put up in it, nigga look at this spinach
Roll it nigga hit it, two minutes you finished
I'm still getting thoed
Tripping on niggas, wearing these Rumpelstiltskin clothes
But to each his own, who knows behind closed do's
But never mind, I'll mind mine I'm just getting blowed

[Chorus]
Yeah, blowed
Yeah, getting blowed

[Devin the Dude]
While you mumbling, I'm crumbling herb
Niggas always tripping, bout some'ing they heard
It's so easy to be the, one behind the topic
And the subject you won't love it, but there is no way to stop it
And ain't no need in plotting, cause that shit will leave ya nothing
But alone and rotten, friends gone and forgotten
But there's another option, you can just say fuck it
Pull out your dick, and tell all them hoes to suck it
Been through it influenced, men do some crazy shit
Dabbled here on different drugs, fucked me up and made me quit
My lady bitch slut hoe, whatever left me
(which one) shit all of em, they never kept me
Mary swept me off my feet, when I was younger
But yet and still at big events, they wonder why I brung her
Yes I hunger for someone, to understand the code
You can knock three times you'll see, I'm just getting blowed

[Chorus]
[Devin the Dude]
Yes sir, real early in the morning I be on that weed
In the afternoon yes I zoom-zoom, until late in the evening
And then at night I just take flight, up up and away
So if you see me flying by high don't mind me, I'm just getting blowed

[Chorus]
Blowed, yeah
Getting blowed
