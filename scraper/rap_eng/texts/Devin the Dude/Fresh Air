Feat. DNA, Rum
[Devin the Dude]
Indeedly I needed me, a breath of fresh air
Stepped outside, but wasn't none there
Took a walk up the block, why not to get a cold drank
Fuck it a twelve, it ain't like I ain't got no bank
With a stride I arrive, at the corner sto'
I felt sorry for a bum, I gave him some he said he wanted mo'
Wanted to kick him in his chest, and take my ends back
Started to think, bout where his family and his friends at
And I could even be his kin, that didn't recognize him
Walk right passed, and despised him
Or he can even be, disguised as a peasant
But really he's an angel, derived from up in heaven
Just to scope out the selfish, and the ones with greed
Who don't give shit, and take more than what they need
And then I thought to myself, say dude he's a man too
I gave him a few more dollas, and a cool breeze came through

[Rum]
For certain I was hurting, kinda down on my luck
Seems I had just run out of gas, and I needed a few bucks
Wires hanging out the tire, on my raggedy truck
And I ain't gon' lie I wanna cry, but hell I sucked the shit up
And get to walking with this gas can, looking like a mad man
Talking to myself, trying to formulate a game plan
And that's quite difficult, when you ain't got no cash in hand
And the people that could help you, passing by you laughing
And it's hot and they don't understand, have no idea
And you probably wouldn't get the picture either, till you out here
With nobody else to help, and you just stuck with yourself
Searching for strength to carry on, and not give up on yourself
Though it's hard but I just, keep my stride keep my pace
Swallow my pride like I must exceed, and keep my faith
I'm asking God cause I don't know, how much mo' I can take
But it's when I couldn't bend no mo', that's why they gave me a break and I'm like

(*24 second instrumental*)

[DNA]
Life is like a roller coaster, always up and down
And what goes around, nigga always come around
Trying to stay above water mayn, I ain't trying to drown
Know we all gotta die, but I ain't trying to go now
I weeble and wobble, but I won't fall
Struggle a little, but I won't crawl
If I fall down sucker, I'ma pop back tall
I ain't perfect, but I'm trying to do the right thing y'all
If I could press rewind, and do it over again
Then I would right all my wrongs, and erase all my sins
But I can't, all I can do is pray and don't pull a stunt
I got more time that's behind me, then I got left in front
I finally see in which direction, that I need to go
I might crash moving too fast, so I'm taking it slow
And I learned life's a gamble, and sometimes it ain't fair
When I'm faced with shit I can't handle, I go get some fresh air

(*instrumental until end*)
