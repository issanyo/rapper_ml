Dope

You're pussy's like dope

[ Devin ]
What's up baby
I'm just sittin here eatin this tunafish sandwich
Something just told me to write you a letter
Tellin you how good that pussy is
And yo, I appreciate it
Check it out

Roses are red, dookie is green
Yo pussy's like dope, girl, I geek and I fiend
I wake up in the mornin with my dick brick-hard
Awakened by the sound of the way yo pussy farts
I get up, I start takin shit to the pawn shop
So I can rent a room and we can fuck like non-stop
Cause when I start, it's hard to finish
One nut just ain't enough, I got to stick my dick back in it
Run up in that pussy like a fullback
Those pussy lips of yours, they grip my dickhead and pull back
It's like dope cause when I'm through strokin
My eyes are wide open, my friends think I'm smokin
I try to call you at your house, if you ain't home, then I'll beep
I gets no sleep cause I geek
And if I lose your beeper number, I get nervous, girl, I just can't cope
Bitch, yo pussy's like dope

(Hey homie, you got to get a grip, man
On the real, man
Damn, gotta snap out of it
Man, but anyway, what make that bitch pussy so much better than everybody else's?
Pussy is pussy, man)

Man, I used to fuck with hoes in Hawaii, bitches in Nebraska
I even got some cold wet pussy in Alaska
Fucked them sharp-chinned, pointed-nosed, long-legged white whores
And other colored pussies but there's still none like yours
I gots to have it, it's my goddamn drug
Them shiny hairs on your pussy's like a bearskin rug
Makes me give you money, I take you out to dinner
No joke, I 'm goin broke just to keep my dick up in ya
But shhh - dont tell everybody about it
Cause it's mine and I wanna be the only one that's got it
You call me up, you know I just come and scoop fast
And get my pipe just right, so I can get me a blast
It's like dope, I wouldn't stop if I could
Cause that pussy is warm and it's deep and it's good
It's got me lyin and stealin, now I'm feelin that there's just no hope
Bitch, yo pussy's like dope
