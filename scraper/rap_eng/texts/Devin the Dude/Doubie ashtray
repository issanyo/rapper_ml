What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone?
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up
Out the doobie ashtray, why they do me that way?
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna take a pill but ya end's all gone?
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up
Out my doobie ashtray, why they do me that way?
You probably don't have a big ol' house on the hill
But if you did just imagine how it would feel
If your phone got disconnected, no cash, and ya gas cut off
And the gal that you had that was helping just stepped the fuck off
She took the kid, the dog and the kitty
And everybody know you're at a low they feel pity
And what's really fucked up is now you're just normal
No more hoes, no more clothes, can't go to the show 'cause it's formal
And you wonder why, why, why, why, why
And you resort to gettin' high
But damn, you can't find ya stash
And you never took the time to ask yourself
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone?
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up
Out the doobie ashtray, why they do me that way?
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna take a pill but ya end's all gone?
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up
Out my doobie ashtray, why they do me that way?
You probably don't have a lot of money
But if you did would you find it funny
If you lent and you spent it, and you didn't invest
Or put it in the bank so we can gain some interest
You just went and copped the biggest car you could find
And a couple more just like it so your friends could follow behind
Never mind how much it costs, you copped the best weed to smoke
And for her a fur coat, you got jet skis and boats
And next thing you're broke
(Damn)
And the yacht that you got, it won't sail or float
You look back and try to catch someone's attention for help
You made a right at the light and they made a left and you ask yourself
What you gonna do when the people go home
And you wanna smoke weed but the reefer's all gone?
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up
Out the doobie ashtray, why they do me that way?
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you wanna take a pill but ya end's all gone?
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up
Out my doobie ashtray, why they do me that way?
Why they do me that way? Yeah, hey, hey, hey
Ain't no more doobies in the tray
What you gonna do when the people go home
(Home, home, home)
Wanna smoke some weed but the reefer's all gone?
(Gone, gone, gone)
What you gonna do when your friends go home
And you wanna take a pill but your end's all gone?
(Gone, gone, gone, gone)
All gone
