[Verse 1]
Well, hello again my weed smokin' friends I'm glad you came
With coughee in your cups, if I went up I'll do the same
And you can pass it to someone you've never met
And let 'em get just as high as you, you're eyes red as shit, mine too
We 'bout to start the show who got an Optimo?
A swisha suite, a zig zag and the bitch that'll kiss my meat
This cordless mic, I know what they like
Continue to rockin' the show that'll slow up a fight
And I know of a dyke, who wouldn't mind
Gettin' some of this dick from behind
But I'm gonna chill y'all
'Cause she might wanna start wearin' my draws and

[Hook]
Oh no, don't want that shit to happen
Get it twisted just because I'm rappin'
Don't want that shit to happen
Don't get it twisted just because I'm rappin'
Don't want that shit to happen

[Verse 2]
Admirin' my weed jar, it's rather stocky
At the crib, how 'bout myself lookin' at hockey
And wonderin' who's gonna win The Cup
If it was full of coughee I know the brothers will man up
I'll stand up to get a drink, then I get a call
"Can you come over so I can lick your balls?"
Well yes, I guess let me shampoo my nuts and get dressed
I'll be there in 20 minutes
Mission complete, I hit the street with the suite, some heat
But fuck, there's some cops on the beat
And there's some crooked laws
That'll pull you over and dig all in your draws and

[Hook]
Oh no, don't want that shit to happen
Get it twisted just because I'm rappin'
I don't want that shit to happen
Get it twisted just because I'm rappin'

[Verse 3]
5:30 P. M., I'm at the lab again
Another song about to take another stab again
Drinkin' and laughin' and puff, puff, passin' it
To and fro' while constructin' my flow
And pick up some hoes up in this motherfucker
Hey, whatcha wanna do girl?
"I don't wanna tease you, I just wanna please you
And lick you from your neck to the top of your dick
And then rub my clit and grind my hips"
Oh, that sounds like some pretty cool shit
But damn, might get full of weed and alcohol
I go to sleep, you try to dig off in my wallet and in my draws and

[Hook]
Don't want that shit to happen
Get it twisted just because I'm rappin'
I don't want that shit to happen
Get it twisted just because I'm rappin'

Don't want that shit to happen
Don't get it twisted just because I'm rappin'
I don't want it, don't want it, don't want it
Don't want that shit to happen
