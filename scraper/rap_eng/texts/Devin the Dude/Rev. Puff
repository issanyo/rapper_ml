[Intro dialogue]

[Rev. Puff]
Yeah, but I'm here to tell y'all about a new group out there
Who dat? I said the Squad
Now you got the Def Squad, you got Mod Squad, you got the Hit Squad
Even the muthafuckin' Hot Squad
They out there making noise everywhere
Just got their little records and track played on the air
If they claim to be so hard (hush your mouth, hush your mouth)
Well, I'm gon' tell 'em beware
'Cause there's some new summabitches out there
And their name is Odd Squad
(He ain't lyin')
Now, Deacon Johnson (Yes?) Where ya  at? (Right here)
You got some papers? (Yessir) OK, hold up right quick
Now Brother Rob, do you mind breaking a beat down one more time?
