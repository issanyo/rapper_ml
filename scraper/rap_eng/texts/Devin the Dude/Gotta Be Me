Yes I’ve just got to be me, me, me
So you know I’m gonna smoke weed, weed, weed

I’m not lazy bitch, since the day we met
You know I sit around the crib and I blaze a bit
The more I smoke the higher I get
If there’s a new strain out I’m gonna try that shit
If I was out on the streets I’d have to flee from the law
So I stay inside the house and smoke weed in my drawers
I always keep some reefer and it’s legal but the people want to see for themselves
It’s a tree for your health, yeah
Pass it around and after you hit it
I’ll roll up another for the third brotha get it
(damn what kind of shit is this where you get this shit from)
Down the street round the corner good marijuana
Powerful smell like it’s been dipped in ammonia but no
(hey hey hold up, hold it down low just hold it down low)

Yes I just got to be me, me, me
So you know I’m gonna smoke weed, weed, weed

Hey yo lets step out to the parking lot
Spark about 5 and get high and trip out
And grab a 40 OZ or two for old time sake
You know how we use to do it back in the day
Headaches and hangovers from all that malt liquor
(well lets go to the store) naw that was just a thought nigga
Shit we can chill right here, nigga I got a whole case nigga of light beer
Cause it’s better for my stomache malt liquor makes me vomit
And uh Weed is all I need so I’mma just chill and
(ah hold up, who the fuck’s calling me right now man, I’m in the middle of a song man)
(yeah and I was doing backups, that’s some bullshit)
(oh oh hey what’s up man, ah yeah man chit you still coming through)
(yeah shit I’m gonna I’m in the middle of a song man yeah)
(we’re at the house the hook’s about to come up I’ve gotta hurry up hold on )

Yes I’ve just got to be me, me, me
So you know I’m gonna smoke weed, weed, weed
Oh yeah baby, I’m gonna smoke it everyday
Oh yeah baby, I’m gonna smoke everyday

Be it early morning late afternoon
You know I’m gonna get high if I have to zoom
Zoom like the commodores connoisseur of coffee
Not the kind you drink but you pull on softly
I’m awfully high but of course you know
I wish I could take weed everywhere I go
But indeed there’s things that I need to achieve
So I’ll just get high for a while

Yes I’ve just got to be me, me, me
So you know I’m gonna smoke weed, weed, weed
