[Verse]
Devin: What's the problem officer?
Officer: Mr. Copeland, won't you step out the vehicle slowly
Wipe that grin off your face, don't look at me like you know me
The reason I stopped ya, wasn't cause of radar
But my dog smelled marijuana from the inside of my car
Devin: Aww man
Officer: That must be some strong shit
Devin: Your dog got the fragrance fucked up, that's coffee, you want a sip?
Officer: Hell I sip coffee too, that ain't the way it smells
Now just tell me where you got it from and you might not go to jail
Devin: Man, go to jail? Man we going to the studio, we on the way man, we rapper man
Officer: No, no see I see paper and cigars, where's the pipes and the bongs?
You said you a rap singer, let me here one of those songs
Devin: Ahhh...smoking that weed, feeling fine
Got me a forty and a fat ass dime
Officer: No, I don't think I heard that one before
Devin: Odd Squad '94
Officer: Why don't you step back here with me. Close that door
