(On the phone with his girlfriend)
Aw, naw
Not again
What you mean?
Ok, like that, huh?
Man, you're always trippin'
Naw, fuck it
Go ahead
Peace

Ooh, clothes on your back
Got food on the table

[Hook]
You've got food on the table
You've got clothes on your back
You've got all your bills paid
Why you want to treat me like that?
You go and do as you please
Keeping me on a string
Go 'head and cut me loose so you can go due yo thang

[Verse 1]
I do all that I can
You're never satisfied
And always seemed to have your mouth poked out
You're able to pay your cable, your money's spent 'cause of the rent
You're on your ass because of the gas, water and shit
I step in to help out, go 'head, keep the change
You spend it up, then, you say stuff like you don't need a man
Now you're on to other things, for certain, you changed
You went from new curtains to hang to purses and rings
Buying all that expensive shit, can't afford it
And when I don't pay for it, I'm on some bullshit
You want your cake and eat it too
Then, you try to act like I needed you

[Hook]
You've got food on the table
You've got clothes on your back
You've got all your bills paid
Why you want to treat me like that?
You go and do as you please
Keeping me on a string
Go 'head and cut me loose so you can go due yo thang

[Verse 2]
You keep talking to your friends about what I don't do
While past relationships steadily haunt you
Your knight in shiny armor is now to slow for you
Wardrobe is getting to old to do what it's supposed to do
Sometimes I need somebody to help me
You're forgetting the big picture, nothing but selfies
Left me lonely like MC Shan's chick
Fine dining while I'm eating a flimsy sandwich
You're out on the town, doing it big
Letting the top drop, just you and your wig
Forgetting about a nig until the times get hard
But where's my reward when mine get hard?

You know, seems like I deserve something every now and then
You should treat me better than just the average friend
Every time you come to me, you're always trying to complain
Damn, man

[Hook]
You've got food on the table
You've got clothes on your back
You've got all your bills paid
Why you want to treat me like that?
You go and do as you please
Keeping me on a string
Go 'head and cut me loose so you can go due yo thang


(On the phone with his girlfriend)
Yeah, go on on then
You know what I'm saying?
Do what you got to do
You know what I'm saying?
Hey, I ain't tripping
I'm good, you know what I'm saying?
We came in this together
As adult human beings, we're going to leave the same way
You know what I'm saying?
You got your life and I got mine
We can't do it together, hey, divide and conquer
Go ahead, due yo thang
I'll holler at ya

[Hook]
You've got food on the table
You've got clothes on your back
You've got all your bills paid
Why you want to treat me like that?
You go and do as you please
Keeping me on a string
Go 'head and cut me loose so you can go due yo thang

(On the phone with his girlfriend)
Well, that's what it is
It is what it is
You're leaving, huh?
Go ahead
Well, take everything, take everything
Well, if you don't mind, can you leave the pussy right there for me?
You know what I'm saying?
You can get the fuck out of here but please leave the pussy right there
Man, shit!
