Damn, hey, nice to meet you again
It's been a minute since I sent you
And it seems that you doin' so fine
You know sometimes I wish you were still mine

'Cause all the freaky things we used to do
The stuff you taught other things what I can do to you
I never forget all of the knowledge you gave me
Whenever I was feeling down you knew how to raise me

What a lady like you doing in a place like this
Hey, let's go to my place right quick
And quickly get the party started
And bring back memories oh shit

Somebody park like holla nigga
Me, you, her, wharap nigga, he want you
You heard, hey he want you
Alright cool, cool

You sure looking fine, girl
Wish I could turn back time, girl
You'd still be mine, girl
Who in the hell is dat nigga dere

Sure looking nice, girl
I wouldn't think twice, girl
To have you in my life, girl
Who in the hell is dat nigga dere

Here take my number down
I'll probably see you around
At the club somewhere right here in H-town
You better hurry up and leave

That nigga's looking kinda crazy
Like he drunk desperate for his lady
Tell him how I used to do you smack you on the butt
Back in your daddy buick

Yo, I'm just playing, but you know, all I'm saying is
Whenever you need something inside you
Call me, girl, I'll satisfy you any day or any night
I put this dick right in your life

Now if you his wife then now nevermind
'Cause ain't no sense for somebody dying or doing time for no pussy
But if you wanna give it to me that's fine
Then come with me and leave him behind 'cause

You sure looking fine, girl
Wish I could turn back time, girl
You'd still be mine, girl
Who in the hell is dat nigga dere

Sure looking nice, girl
I wouldn't think twice, girl
To have you in my life, girl
Who in the hell is dat nigga dere

Ah shit, here's he comes a nigga drunk
Bumping his gums, thinking he gonna do something
Shit if he gonna swing at me, I'ma swing back
Nigga, I can hang with you something

But there's no way to talk motherfucker nigga
Ey you, I know you nigga, shit
Say man, I rap, man, I wanna do something
I've been trying to get in touch with you, man
You so hard to get in touch with, man
My girl told me that she knew you and you can put me on

Whenever you need something inside you
(I didn't knew you were with this beautiful girl right here)
Call me, girl, I'll satisfy you
(Well, I just met her)
Any day or any night
I put this dick right in your life

You sure looking fine, girl
Wish I could turn back time, girl
You'd still be mine, girl
Who in the hell is dat nigga dere

Sure looking nice, girl
I wouldn't think twice, girl
To have you in my life, girl
Who in the hell is dat nigga dere
