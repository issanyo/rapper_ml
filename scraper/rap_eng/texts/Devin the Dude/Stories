[Verse 1: Berner]
It ain't easy to get a piece of mind lately
Bunch of grown ass men, little crybabies
They wanna live like me, with their hands out
But ain't shit free
I started with a half ounce
I worked miracles with that bag
I seen killers turn snitch, when shit go bad
I don't wanna make my little girl miss her dad
So much work in the car I hadn't pissed my pants
We was right in Wyoming, about to pass Cheyenne
Two unmarked cars on our ass
Shit's crazy, real d-boy stories
I remember being broke, we don't live past 40 these days
[Verse 2:B-Real]
Since we tell stories true homie
On some shit you never knew homie
Momma was a trap star
South bay flipping bricks from fast cars
You see it in my genetics
From me to go out and get it
Being broke is pathetic
In the hole with no credit
That don't forget it so that i never go back
Scared of the dark im stacking these packs
Keep them as its elevated
On the lemonade and key lime sub line
Still so fucking faded
Almost forgot the last 3 lines
[Verse 3: Devin the Dude]
