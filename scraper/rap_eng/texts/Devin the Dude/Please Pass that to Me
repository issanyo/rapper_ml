Coffee in my cup tryna stay up baby for your flight (you don't get in til midnight)
Take another puff of this good stuff now I feel right (you know I gotta get my shit tight)
It's been almost a year since you moved outta state
Don't know if you was tryna make me prove I could wait, but a
Thousand miles ain't far enough I guess I called your bluff
I hope you brought back all your stuff
I'm just wondering and I'm somewhat pondering if you would stay with me, spend the night a-slumberin
You're only in for maybe 4 or 5 days, and you just can't be sure cause you don't know if I stayed
Honest, loyal and true, I promise I'm spoiled with you
The weed, the rhymes, the rock the crown royal the blue
Could never throw me off balance enough
To go and try to challenge your love
You're flyin to and fro, gettin paid, that's good
You said you never would be stuck in the hood
I'm so glad you're back, you should know that's a fact
Let me put on this soul track and relax

Now would you please pass that to me
Oh you know how happy i would be
And I would never turn it down
And I'd never pass it around

I've been waitin for so long
You got me barely holding on
I been trying to score your love
Now you finally showed up, hold on
Please

That's that right here girl
You know what I want, you ain't trippin
Been waiting all this time, I knew it's going down

I've been waiting for so long
You got me barely holding on
I been trying to score your love
Now you finally showed up, hold on
Please

Now would you please pass that to me
Don't you know how happy i would be
And I would never turn it down
And I'd never pass it around
