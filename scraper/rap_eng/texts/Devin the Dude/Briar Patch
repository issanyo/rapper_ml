The briar patch
No don’t throw me in the briar patch
You can cut off all my toes but not the briar patch
You can fill me full of holes but not the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Please don’t put me in the briar patch
You can season and cook me but not the briar patch
For me no one would ever look off in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in

I hop, I jump, I skip through the rubble
Yo, me ain’t looking for trouble
I was just trying to get to the other end, I never been
Maybe then I can tell my friends how it is. I’ve been
Searching for someone to help me, maybe you can
But it’s hard to tell you how I feel when you got a knife in your hand
You can carve me, tie me up and starve me
Put me on the grill, still nothing can harm me
Like the briar patch
Don’t chunk me in
What kind of luck would I have then?
Wait a minute man, before you put me in it use the gun
That you got, a couple of bullets, I’ll be finished – done
Or hey, I can help you find a pot
Help you build a fire, help you get it good and hot
Well, unless you like to eat me cold
You can but oh no
Please don’t throw me in

The briar patch
No don’t throw me in the briar patch
You can cut off all my toes but not the briar patch
You can fill me full of holes but not the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Please don’t put me in the briar patch
You can season and cook me but not the briar patch
For me no one would ever look off in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in

You’s an ugly motherfucker, dog, I just call it like I see it
And your breath is like death, if you don’t like it so be it
I get mistreated by others if you cut for me or not
Slice off my toes if that’s how it goes I really don’t give a fuck
If all of this belongs to you, do what you do, go ‘head

But throw me in the briar’s patch and you’ll never see so much red
I bled from less than just trespassing cuz, I’m just asking for a favor
Excuse my rude behavior
I’m just trying to savor the flavor of the fruit I just picked
And if you don’t like it, you can suck my dick

But what you don’t do is throw me in the briar patch and then I’m through
Come on man, can’t we call a truce
Can we do somethin about it before people end up crying and shoutin and poutin
Man, come on man, now that would really hurt …

The briar patch
No don’t throw me in the briar patch
You can cut off all my toes but not the briar patch
You can fill me full of holes but not the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Please don’t put me in the briar patch
You can season and cook me but not the briar patch
For me no one would ever look off in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in the briar patch
Don’t throw me in
