[Verse One]
She was beautiful, intelligent, fine, attractive
You could just picture her, layin' on a mattress
And she's got you wonderin' if she' sexually active
You think of somethin' slick to say to pull her like a magnet
Came with your A game, thirty minutes or less
That's all that takes and she'll come out of that dress
Conversated with the lady maybe she'll buy it
Oh, she did, you took her where? The Hyatt
She did things that had never been done to ya
You want to stay in touch, figurin' she's the one for ya
And now you're tellin' all your friends
How you hit the first night and she didn't even ask for no ends
And your feelings got deeper and deeper
You went shoppin' for a promise right, thinkin' you can keep her
But you ain't heard from her
And ain't seen her in a week
Yep, fucked around and fell in love with a FREAK

FREAK

[Verse Two]
You finally get a call, it was her, sayin' she was out of town
Somethin' came up but she's back now
You pay it no mind because the ladie's so fine
You let the same shit slide bout three, four times
She break you off
Everyday, every way
New sexual ideas, different ways to lay
Your homeboys teasin' about your nose wide open
You pay 'em no mind, you plan on eloping with the broad
Scopin' how hard it is with no vagina
You get up out your sleep to go find her
You just can't let her loose
And every time she's missin' she's got a better excuse
So you don't get mad
Just ask her how was her day
She went shoppin' for some trashy lingerie
Brand new toys, fresh batteries inside 'em
You wonder how they work but she's already tried 'em
She's a FREAK

[Verse Three]
And then there came a time, when you got the word in the hood
Some of your patna's say they heard she's no good
With the evidence to back it up but you don't want to listen
They just don't wanna see a nigga happy, they trippin'
And you pretend, everything's, all gravy
More and more you have to apprehend your old lady
You up and say, "Fuck it", went and bought her a ring
The price wasn't a problem
Shit it ain't no thing
If that'll make you settle down and she'll just chill
The two of y'all can start from scratch and just build
But she's steady goin' AWOL
Now she's at the game?
When she started watchin' baseball?
Say dawg
Don't even try to search
Cause if you catch up with her, what you see might hurt
Oh where, oh where have your little girl gone?
Probably givin' one of the players of the Astro's dome
Cause she's a FREAK
