[Verse 1: K-Rino]
Signs of hate, look for the ones that be watching your funds
They'll eventually lead to your clique and your cock and your guns
You know the type of cat that's always finding fault in your game
The one that's always tryna [?] in your name
Sabotaging your every move with scientific precision
Catch their eyes turn your flesh with your peripheral vison
Stay on the low 'cause I'm a threat that go from cool to illegal
Why would a fool you never met before be mad when he see you?
The broke one that's always talking down on a player that's rich
Scared of jail before he do a week the bastard will snitch
They spend half of his shit that hits at a disasterous pitch
Venomous passages inject poison and damage a clique
I insist on swinging my fist and leaving them pissed
Breaking bones inside your body that don't even exist
Whether you know me or you don't keep all that plex on the shelf
They spend more time hating on you than loving theyself, for sure

[Hook x3: K-Rino]
These are the signs of hate
People knocking every move that you tryna make
Always [?] but you know every line is fake
I push 'em off because I ain't got the time to waste
Murder I contemplate
