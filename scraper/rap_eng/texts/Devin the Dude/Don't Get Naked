[Intro]
(Come on girl, we can't do this
Come on man, we gotta move on girl)

[Verse 1]
We've been going down this bumpy road
For a while
You're always in a grumpy mood
You never smile
I did all that I could
But then you left
Can't help but to think
About yourself
You had fun with your friends
You did your thing
Going out with different men
You love to drink
And do all kinds of freaky stuff
They used you up
Now you running right back to me
Ready to fuck saying

[Chorus]
You can wait but
I can't take it
Let's not fake it
We ain't gonna make it
I tried my best so
You tried too but
Let's give it a rest 'cause
We're both clueless!
I don't think
We gon' make it
Please don't get naked

[Interlude]
(Come on please don't do that...Don't drop them panties...You know I can't stand it...
Sometimes I do wonder, do it still taste like cotton candy? Let me stop being mannish)

[Verse 2]
I still kind of miss ya girl
I must admit
Remember when I was up in ya girl
A perfect fit, like
Andre Hopkins glove
They be snug
But all my baby's love
You gave it up
I did not virtue
Can't say I did not hurt you
But nevertheless did my very best
But you couldn't help
Raising up your dress, bitch!
And everything you did for me
Made me realize ain't shit for free
Now there's no one you can trust
And you had enough
Running back to me
Ready to fuck, saying

[Chorus]
You can wait but
I can't take it
Let's not fake it
We ain't gonna make it
I tried my best though
You tried too but
Let's give it a rest 'cause
We're both clueless
I don't think
We gon' make it
Please don't get naked
I don't think
We gon' make it
Please don't get naked
