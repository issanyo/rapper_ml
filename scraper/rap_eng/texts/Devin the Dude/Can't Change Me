[Talking K-Dee]
Call me if you change your mind

[Devin]
I see you like takin your chances
But if your nigga knew that you do butt-naked dances
And runnin my bath and rubbin soap on my feet
Smokin my meat, while I'm smokin a sweet
And we losin his mind, thinkin bout doin a crime
The way you lick on my nutts and make me bust two at a time
You persuing my penis I seen this happen before
We fuck for bout a month and we ain't laughin no more
Then you start to get just a little curious
I don't call in two days and you take the shit serious
We can get crunk smoke weed and shit
But I rather you just call when you need some dick
There's a whole bunch of hoes out there like you
Who love to fuck and suck dick too
Gotta dip dip dive dive what can I say
She try to hit' em all inside of one day

(Chorus- Devin)
But ah, I can stick around and keep you company
Or you can spend the night if it was up to me
You can change him but you can't change me
Cause you know i rather fuck than watch t.v

Girl, I can stick around and keep you company
Or you can spend the night if it was up to me
Girl, you can change him but you can't change me
Cause you know I rather fuck than watch t.v

[Talking K.B.]
Naw you ain't got to cut the t.v. on
Why don't you just stand up and model for me

[K-Dee]
I can tell you like niggas sportin rings and lacs
Got me spittin not hittin with no strings attached
You got a man, I understand I'm cool with it
You wanna look cause a nigga don't know what to do with it
Thats why I get it, sexy outfits like french maids
Got you hollin my name with every inch laid
While I'm, fuckin I'm thinkin of ways of gettin paid
That night you was suckin, damn thats why I stayed
Now you mad cause I played more fields than Kim
Got you sayin I wish you were more like him
Ain't that a bitch, expectin me to oil you
Wine and dine your ass cause he swore you
What I look like washin your back while you shower
I ain't the nigga for leavin letters I'm sending flowers
Tryin to arch my ways, damn thats funny to me
You can change him but you can't change me

(Chorus- K-Dee) x2

[K.B.]
I lay these hoes, slay these hoes
Play these hoes, never pay these hoes
Between bitches and hoes man they really ain't shit
Some of yall givin them dick, you givin them rent money
You fuckin with him because he treats you nice
To me you a ho he'll make you his wife
He takin you shoppin and now you out boppin
For a nigga like me who talkin bout knockin
That ass on the first night, the comfort inn
You got a man at home, shit I'll be your friend
I don't need a bitch all attached to me
Cause I use these hoes then lose these hoes
Abuse these hoes for owning my dick
I'm beatin it up you nuttin too quick
I'm only out for one thang and its plan to see
You may have changed him but you can't change me

(Chorus- K.B.) x2

[Talking K.B.]
You know what I'm sayin
I know you listenin
You know I want to be up in that pussy right now
Let me come by and just dick ya down
I'm trippin, but I'm trippin cause I know you listenin
Huh, when you ridin with your boyfriend or whatever just act like it ain't you
Thats what I'm talkin bout, I ain't gone trip off that shit either
Naw naw, you having good pussy ain't got nothing to do with this (Laughing)
I'm Out!
