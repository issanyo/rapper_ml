There's no double you
You might just have to ex, out your problems
Tell my why, and pretend you don't see...

[Devin]
Yep... ya fucked up didn't ya?
Ya didn't come home last night and he pinned ya
Up against the wall, you shouted "hell nah"
You makin a phone call nigga hit you in the jaw
You scream, you scratch, you bite, kick and yell
But the neighbors think y'all fuckin, hell they can't tell
But ya eyes is swelled and ya nose all red
And ya jaw fucked up, you wanna go but ya scared
(Why the fuck did ya do what ya did when ya done it?)
Now all these thoughts, they come back after ya fronted
Then ya drown yourself in all the ache and pain
Thirsty for the love but tired of drinkin the rain
First girl you gotta look at yourself
When ya gone it's like yo, there's no you left
You can ex it out and begin again though
As long as you know...

Yep... ya fucked up didn't ya?
You hit her in the mouth and now they tryna lynch ya
In the prison bars with the fences and walls
You makin a phone call nigga hit you in the jaw
Now two of 'em on you, in a three man cell
But boss way down there, hell he can't tell
But ya eyes is swelled and ya bleedin ya tank
And ya jaw fucked up, you wanna leave but ya cain't
(Why the fuck did ya do what ya did when ya done it?)
Love hurts sometimes, but that's what you wanted
Too fake to break but too hard to cry
Now you lookin at five, what ya gon' do now?
My nigga, would ya look at yourself
When ya gone it's like yo, there's no you left
You can ex it out and begin again though
As long as you know...
