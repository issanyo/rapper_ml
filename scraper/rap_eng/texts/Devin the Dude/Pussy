[Intro: Devin the Dude]
Pussy is a whole different aspect of life
Wars don' started from country to country, over they women
Pussy, is one of the most powerful thangs in the world
And a lot of people don't understand how powerful pussy is
Pussy make niggas, blow they brains out, they bitch brains out
Uh, uh, pussy make people do thangs they never would think they'd do

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u-s-s-y (let's have some fun)
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why niggas get they hair cut, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, he cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u-s-s-y

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I, I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown
Hands down, mami had the bombest pussy in town
One dip in the girl pool, that's all it took
One sample of the Snapper, and ya ass was whupped
Have you buyin' Gucci sandals, matchin' pocket books
Blowin' up her beeper, ringin' her phone off the hook
Ball players spent money, rappers they spent time
All the while they both claimin' that they never spent a dime
Business guys, she would victimize
Have 'em payin' rent on condos in the Miami high rise
They ask her, "who pussy is this?", look her right in her eyes
She said "this pussy's yours daddy", tell 'em nothin' but lies
Ha, they didn't believe it, but they wanted to, needed to
She had the type of body, that you didn't want leavin' you
So they ignored all her flirtin' ways
And put a ring on her finger I'm like, Earth to Dave

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, gotta have the best ride
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u, I see you

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Now, I ain't no rapper, but I'ma say my shit
When it comes down to that motherfuckin' clit, clit, clit
Niggas are sick, sick, sick, turn on you quick, quick, quick
That's why I be givin' mami much, dick, dick, dick
Why chumps be coppin' them diamonds and furs, and all that
Fiendin' for this pussy, as if y'all was on crack
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back
Y'all cats that be babysittin' these broads need to be smacked
It's this nigga named Monroe, that I know from way back
He hit the lotto bought this girl a Cadillac
Now this bitch be creepin' behind this nigga's back
He busted her, guess what, he still took the bitch back
Three things niggas love: money, pussy, and drugs
Can't get one without the other 'less you soft and in love
Y'all take it from a playa whose done all the above
Niggas it's the lesbian R&B thug

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, gotta have the best ride
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u, I see you

[Verse 3: Devin The Dude]
The P is for the pearl tongue, that I like to tickle
The U is for the uterus, down deep in the middle
SS, it's so slippery, when I go up inside
Pussy is good, and if you getting some, I know you know why!
See, I got my first shot when I was about seven
Her father called my house and said:
"I need to talk to your son, Devin
My daughter she’s eleven
And she goes to the same school
That your son goes to, and she said today she got screwed!"
But my daddy answered the phone,so no drama
And all he said was "No shit! Let me talk to that girl mama!"
Then I was suspended three days, taken from school
It was like a vacation, nigga was looking at pussy at the pool in our apartments
I started hitting hard when I was small
Let me recite the story lesson for all of y'all
See pussy is like wound that would never heal
The more ointment you put on the better it feels, 'cause it's the…

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, gotta have the best ride
The power of the p-u-s-s-y
Ha, the power of the p-u-s-s-y
That's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the p-u, I see you

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Oh yeah, niggas would do anything
For some pussy, hey, hey, hey, oh
See it don't matter who you are
Where ya from, in this life
At some point, you're gonna wanna get you some
Yes you will, oooo, uuuh
