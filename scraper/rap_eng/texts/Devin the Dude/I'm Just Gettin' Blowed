[Intro - Devin The Dude (singing)]
Yeahhhh
Blowed
Yeahhhh
(Tha Bizness, Tha Bizness)

[Verse 1 - Devin The Dude (rapping)]
The hear-say, the talking, the chatter
The gossip and the rumors
See to me, it don't matter
I barely go out
And if you ever see me
It's probably at a grocery sto', but not on TV
Cause when I get high - I get hungry, so I cook
Go get some weed and...open a book
Of papers, if I don't have a cigar
Hold up, wait - I got some blunts in the car
Mad dash, ran back
With a fresh box of swishers
(I thought you said blunts?)
Cigarillos, what's the difference?
It's about what you put up in
Nigga, look at this spinach!
Roll it - nigga, hit it!
2 minutes, you finished
I'm still gettin' throwed (hee-hee!)
Trippin' on niggas wearin' these Rumplestilskin clothes
But to each his own
Who knows, behind closed do's
But nevermind, I'll mind mine
I'm just gettin' blowed

[Hook - Devin The Dude (singing)]
Yeahhhhh
Blowed
Yeahhhhh
Gettin' blowed

[Verse 2 - Devin The Dude (rapping)]
While you're mumbling, I'm crumbling erb
Niggas always tripping about something they heard
It's so easy to be thee
One behind the topic
And the subject, you won't love it
But there is no way to stop it
And ain't no need in plotting
Cause that shit will leave you nothing
But alone and rotten
Friends gone and forgotten
But there's another option
You can just say fuck it!
Pull out your dick and tell all them hoes to suck it!
Been through it, influenced
Men do some crazy shit
Dabbled here on different drugs
That fucked me up and made me quit
My lady bitch, slut, ho, or whatever left me
(Which one?)
Shit! All of 'em, they never kept me!
Marry swept me off my feet when I was younger
But yet, and still at big events
They wonder why I brung her
Yes, I hunger
For someone to understand the code
You can knock three times, you'll see
I'm just gettin' blowed

[Hook - Devin The Dude (singing)]
Yeahhhh
Blowed
Yeahhhh
Gettin' blowed

[Verse 3 - Devin The Dude (singing)]
Yes sir, real early in the morning
I be on that weed
In the afternoon
Yes, I zoom-zoom
Until late in the evening
And then at night, I just take flight
Up, up, and away
So if you see me flying by high
Don't mind me
I'm just gettin' blowed

[Outro - Devin The Dude (singing)]
Yeahhhh
Blowed
Yeahhhh
Gettin' blowed
Blowed
Yeahhhh
Gettin' blowed
