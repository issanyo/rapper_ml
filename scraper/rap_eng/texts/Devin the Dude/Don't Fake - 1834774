Yeah, Now I could talk about a car or some paint
Maybe jewelry that I bought that you probably can't
The broads that I fuck, the people that I meet
But that shit won't help a young nigga survive on the street
I can tell you 'about how many blocks I bled with the crack
Stood outside every night tryin' to get myself a stack
But when niggas run up on you with that thing to your back
Is your muthafuckin' ass fin to know how to react
See hustlin' is some shit that a nigga is born with
Not some game from a song you can try to get on with
Now you can buy every song 'about crack ever made
But if it ain't in your heart, you ain't fins to get paid
Now read some Iceberg Slim, it might get you a bitch
But you'll never have a stable, you'll never be rich
Memorize all your Screw tapes, it won't make you a G
'Cause niggas dyin' out here tryin' to be they favorite MC

[Hook: Devin the Dude] [x2]
Do whatever you please, say whatever you want
But Don't Fake, don't front naw
'Cause it ain't hard to get touched to get roughed up
To get fucked-up, y'all

[Trae:]
Lately I've been zonin' tryin' to get away from all of the pressure
These wanna-be G's that wanna-be MC's need to get they shit together
It's whatever niggas thinkin' they thuggin' 'cause they crunk off PAC
And everytime they step out on the block, they be the first to get shot
I don't know what you thinkin' but dog we keep it gangsta for real
We took everything that we lived & then supplied it with skills
I don't need no handout 'cause I grind & I can shine on my own
Everything I talked about the memory, I ain't just make up no song
Better check my bloodline, everything I represent might get you shut down
Been in the midst of gorillas respected I never backed down
I'm faithfully mobbin' while y'all be faithfully fakin'
Perpetratin' tryin' to play that roll will get your life faithfully taken
And dismissed bitch you don't wanna get caught up in that street hype
If you ain't been in these streets, then you won't make it in that street life
I'm tellin' you mayne better leave that dick ridin' alone
And go on & do what you do & take your fraud ass back home

[Hook: Devin the Dude] [x2]
Do whatever you please, say whatever you want
But Don't Fake, don't front naw
'Cause it ain't hard to get touched to get roughed up
To get fucked-up, y'all

[Trae:]
Alot of things be on my mind, all the time
Move around, alot of niggas be out here lyin'
All the time, so they can shine
But as long as they don't cross that line
Anytime I don't pay you no mind
I just gotta be me, niggas you need to be you
What you lyin' fo'?

[Hook: Devin the Dude] [x2]
Do whatever you please, say whatever you want
But Don't Fake, don't front naw
'Cause it ain't hard to get touched to get roughed up
To get fucked-up, y'all
