Baby ooh, can you feel what I feel, ah, baby
Oh
Baby ooh, can you, gotcha
Let me know that you can come
We’ll have a ball, have a blast, have big fun
Tell me, can you come?
Any way you want, restaurant, girl, pick one
Come on and come
Let me get that stress up out cha
Come on and come
Ever let me get it, I gotcha
Hey, I’ll be there in a minute
You know I’m comin’, I know you wanna come too
Baby, be still, why you runnin’ from me?
Yes I’ll pick you up; I’ll never let you down
You want me to wait woman, but see I wanna get you now
And where we’re goin’ is not too far
Maybe you been there befo’
But the ride will be so different
I’ll go ‘round the curb slow
I’ll let you grab the sticky shift dessert
Yeah it’s not a stick; I know it looks more like a curve
That’s absurd, that’s obscene, profound
I know but it’s just a verb, or is it a noun?
I’m not your average card-counter
I just like the way you looked at me and saw my thing was hard
And yo, you took a chance, you took a peak
I’ll cook a freak in a minute
But a woman like yourself I just take my time
Till you got no more niggas left in ya
Like muah
But I’m guaranteed to drive you far
Anywhere you want
Let me know that you can come
We’ll have a ball, have a blast, have big fun
Tell me, can you come?
Any way you want, restaurant, girl, pick one
Come on and come
Let me get that stress up out cha
Come on and come
Ever let me get it, I gotcha
If you ever let me get it, I gotcha
I think about cha all the time
Than I try to grab it, pause and rewind
But I can’t get cha out of my mind
Shit I’m tryin’ but it’s hard
So I guess I’ll just sit back and play my part
Of the lonely man with his dick in his hand
Ready to jack even an ugly freak
Sneak a peak, creep up from the back
But no, I chill
Yeah I chill waitin’ for you
But you never put me on your list
You always got shit to do
And I ain't gon’ keep beggin’ you, keep sweatin’ you and shit
You know, I want that pussy and I know you want this dick
We can split, go here and there
‘Round and ‘round, back and forth, to and fro
Just come, you'll feel like you never felt befo’
Yo, I know you heard plenty of lines
Maybe in form of rhymes
But you never screwed with nuts and bolts like mine
Um yeah, just screw it, it ain't, it ain't hard
Well, yeah it is, but, come on, girl
Let me know that you can come
We’ll have a ball, have a blast, have big fun
Tell me, can you come?
Any way you want, restaurant, girl, pick one
Come on and come
Let me get that stress up out cha
Come on and come
Ever let me get it, I gotcha
You know you ought’a come, girl, stop trippin’, you know you wanna come
When the last time you came? Come on, girl, come on
Just come with me, I’ll bring you right back, don’t trip
Let me know that you can come
We’ll have a ball, have a blast, have big fun
Tell me, can you come?
Any way you want, restaurant, girl, pick one
Just come with me and see how easy it can be
Sharin’ your love with somebody like D
Just come with me and see how easy it can be
Sharin’ your love with somebody like D…
I C K, come on
Ain't no sense in stressin’ in the point that I’m addressin’
Just what’s the use of messin’ over your life?
You live twice on this earth, I don’t know
So I’m a make sho’ that if I do come you'll say I came right
Let me know it, lady, come
Let me know that you can come
We’ll have a ball, have a blast, have big fun
Tell me, can you come?
Any way you want, restaurant, girl, pick one
Come on and come
Let me get that stress up out cha
