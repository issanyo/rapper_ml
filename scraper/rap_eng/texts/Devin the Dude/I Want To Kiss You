Hey baby come here
I got something to tell you
See I've been thinking a lot about you lately
And well...

We've spent a lot of time together
I think I'm kind of in to you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm feeling sort of nervous and anxious
To tell you what I'm going through

Well it might be the night
Or it might the bright moonlight
All I see is a wonderful need
And beautiful too
So precious and new
And this is all I want to do

I want to kiss you so bad
So bad it's driving me mad
I want to kiss you real good
Oh and I'm wishing I could
(I, I, I want to, oh baby let me kiss you)

I have a little tiny confession
I don't know what to do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh I have a little tiny obsession
With something that's attached to you

Well it might be your eyes
Or it might be your nice big ooh
I don't know if I want my cover blown
I want the truth
Every time I'm with you
This is what I want to do

I want to kiss you so bad
(Just want to kiss you baby)
(Can I kiss you?)
So bad it's driving me mad
(Just want to kiss you baby)
(I want to kiss you)
I want to kiss you real good
(Just want to kiss you baby)
(And I'm wishin' I could)
Oh and I'm wishing I could
(I, I, I want to, oh baby let me kiss you)

Well it might be the smile
Or the way you look into my eyes
Baby ooh what to do
I won't know until I kiss you
That's why, that's why I got to have you
I got to have you baby
I got to have you
Oh that why I
I got to have you
I got to have you baby
I got to have you
I want to kiss you so bad

I want to kiss you so bad
(Just want to kiss you baby)
(Can I kiss you?)
So bad it's driving me mad
(Just want to kiss you baby)
(I want to kiss you)
I want to kiss you real good
(Just want to kiss you baby)
(And I'm wishin' I could)
Oh and I'm wishing I could
(I, I, I want to, oh baby let me kiss you)

Just want to kiss you baby
Can I kiss you?
Just want to kiss you baby
I want to kiss you
Just want to kiss you baby
And I'm wishin' I could
I, I, I want to, oh baby let me kiss you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
