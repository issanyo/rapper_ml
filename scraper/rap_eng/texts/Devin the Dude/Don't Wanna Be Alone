(I'm sorry)
(Don't go) x2

I don't wanna be alone, beatin on my bone
Waiting all alone by the telephone (I'm sorry)

This was just to see if you're game
But I don't wanna play don't you go and give that good pussy away no (I'm sorry)

Sometimes I forget, smoking weed getting higha an a bitch
I know you're tighter than shit girl (I'm sorry, but don't go)

Don't you say goodbye unless you wanna see a grown man cry girl (don't go)x2
Don't you say goodbye unless you wanna see a grown man cry girl (don't go)

I don't wanna be alone, you got me waiting here by the phone (I'm sorry)
Just call me babe just call meeeeeeee

This was just to see if you're game, x2
I'm the one to blame (I'm sorry)
Just call me baby, I'm sorry

Sometimes I forget smoking weed getting higha an a bitch
I know you're tighter than shit girl
I know you're tired of my wang baby, but don't go

Don't you say goodbye unless you wanna see a grown man cry girl,(don't go) don't you worry (don't go)
Don't you say goodbye unless you wanna see a grown man cry girl, I need you here

Spoken:

You know baby, I know things haven't been going the way their suppose to,between me and you
Hanging out with my friends, smoking, drinking all night (not having you by my side)
Without you by my side I don't know where I would reside (I'm sorry) and you know I'm sorry baby
Sometimes I just get caught up, maybe it's how I was brought up, I don't know
But you know one thing without you there is no me, and without me there is no you (don't go)

Don't you say goodbye unless you wanna see a grown man cry girl, (don't go) x2
Don't you say goodbye unless you wanna see a grown man cry girl, (don't go) x2
(I'm sorry)
Don't you say goodbye unless you wanna see a grown man cry girl (don't go)
Don't you say goodbye unless you wanna see a grown man cry girl (don't go)
