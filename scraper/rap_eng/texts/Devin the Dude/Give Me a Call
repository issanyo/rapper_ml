(Devin the Dude)
Jeaaa, haha
You know my dick been hard, waitin for you
I need you bad girl I'm horny as hell
I need yo love so hit me on my cell
Give me a call, give me a call

I need yo love so hit me on my cell
Give me a call, give me a call
So I can do some damage to you

I need you bad girl I'm horny as hell

VERSE I (Devin the Dude)
You know I'm comin through and ill be there with a sack
I got brothers and I'm ready to put dick in yo back
Cuz you know how to act when you hit me on the cell
You don't be leavin me messages like you mad as hell
You tell me that your pussy's wet and you're thinking bout me
You know that you want it and you really just can't live without me
And I'll be glad to come but after that yo I got to go
Cuz if you start talkin shit bitch I holla ho
Don't have patience for no naggin' ass broad
The one who ignore you when your dick get hard
They know when your dough run low so they be frontin'
They don't give you no pussy if you don't give them no money
But you know what time it is when I'm in your spine with this
You know that you'll never find a dick like I possess
You feel it all in your chest
Sometime it hurt but you can't help but say yes
As I push this dick all up in your bush
Bust a couple of nuts and then I fire up the kush
You put on your panties I put on my drawers
We'll holla next week when the sun falls

VERSE II (Mike Jones)
I fuck hoes good, make em fall asleep
I break a bitch down till she can't breathe
I grind her whole shoulder hit it from the back
Make her climax I know you like that
Your baby daddy trippin hit a nigga up
So I can pick you up get a room and beat it up
Don't got no six pack but I got six stacks
I make them fall in love when I hit it from the back
The girl don't need no bread she one step ahead
I start grabbin her she start givin' head
The girl don't need no bread she one step ahead
I start grabbin her she start givin' head

CHORUS Repeats

VERSE III (Mike Jones)
You need some lovin girl I got antidote

You need a tune up girl let me fix you up
I'll come and pick you up lay you down and dick you up
I mean dick you down girl I'm a ??
You want it like you say you want it come and see me now
I'm something like a doctor I make ya feel good
Ya hand on my woodgrain (now that's real wood)

Want some more dough meet me at the same place
