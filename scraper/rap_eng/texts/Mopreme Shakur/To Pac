[Intro]
I love you 2Pac
I love you 2Pac and Mental, Kato
I love you 2Pac
Peace out

[Verse 1: Macadoshis]
This shit right here I dedicate to my nigga Pac
A true thug soldier first to put me on the block
I remember every thing we used to flow to
And on the real I was blessed just to know you
You told a nigga get your grind or keep ya head up
Even though this wicked world had me fed up
Though misunderstood, your heart would still pure
I remember kickin' up dust, havin' a ball on tour
Swerve and hittin' corners in the Benz through Watts
Going through the shootin' range
Advocating you had twin Glocks
We had the video shoot to show love to my kids
Homie it's trick that if I don't shit we did
And even though in my heart I know you should've lived longer
You best believe dawg, ya nigga Macado' gon' ride for ya
Why you have to leave and all the homies miss your face
But even though you gone we know you're in a better place

[Hook: Big Syke]
You'll carry on after the cowards are long gone
Family's staying strong and mom's holding on
Like you knew she would, wish I could bring you back
Trade places as a matter of fact
You'll carry on after the cowards are long gone
Family's staying strong and mom's holding on
Like you knew she would, wish I could bring you back
Trade places as a matter of fact

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
From local drug dealers, way up in the Bay
To international crime bosses doing shit our way
Still just a legend to many, but he was also my brother
My roaddog in true heart to Amaru Shakur
We rose through these ranks, on weed straps and dank
'91, '92, it was only a chosen few
Riding on our 4's, taking these niggas hoes
Chronic smoke through our nose, as the prophecies unfold
Used to tell me more
Watch this little young nigga do it
Put his stamp on the game, we rolled and mashed to it
Realest nigga you could ever know, true soldier at heart
We all get off track sometime and it so easy to fall apart
But I tried to tell him, 'fore my nigga sat in the pen'
Ain't not peace in vengeance, ain't no rest through revenge
Ain't no starting again, and for that simple fact
It's until these wheels fall off, until my nigga comes back

[Hook: Big Syke]
You'll carry on after the cowards are long gone
Family's staying strong and mom's holding on
Like you knew she would, wish I could bring you back
Trade places as a matter of fact
You'll carry on after the cowards are long gone
Family's staying strong and mom's holding on
Like you knew she would, wish I could bring you back
Trade places as a matter of fact

[Verse 3: Rated R]
[?]
And keep it bang let ya legacy[?]
The world to swirl Pac
Block to block
All says block [?] the shark want you play to to rest
Bloods and Crips, the black path start to pay
Who's to blame, somebody's got to pay for this
We all miss ya, I wish I could hug and kiss ya
Before your death [?]
Only god can judge us, for the things we do
God please forgive us for living life of sins
I pour out some liquor for our lost singles
Thank you Makaveli for putting me in this midst
And lord represent, like when we first met
It's Thug Life 'til death, fuck all you rest
2Pac and the rest are off gate of the rap
Made everybody change [?]

[Big Syke]
God bless your soul, no one really knows
All the love you showed to me

[Verse 4: Big Syke]
I seen the fire in your heart, from the start stayin' true
Pick me out a village of killers and said look what the world have for you
I had no future goals, at the time anything goes
Now I'm rockin' shows, fucking hoes, state to state
Let go of the weight, in the Benz, now I see my dreams
Got me true when I'm a juvenile, now what I am supposed to do
But ride nigga ride, 'til I reach the other side
'Cause there is no where to hide in the world of haters
Perpetrators wastin' they breath 'til there's none left
Thug Life to death, may you rest in peace my nigga
'Cause love don't love nobody
But I love you nigga, 'til they drop my bodyâ€”in the dirt
