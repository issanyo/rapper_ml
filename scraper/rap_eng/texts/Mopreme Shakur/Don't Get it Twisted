[Verse 1: Mopreme]
Just cause a nigga calm an' he got style
Don't think I won't flip and
Don't pull your file
But I got enough bullshit to deal with
I'm rollin' with the thugs so
You must be on drugs to the head
Get your ass break down
Broken half baby
I'm a feelin' like a motherfuckin' psychopath
And if you got beef best leave it in the freezer
I'm no joke
Mopreme straight loc'd
And you could get smoked
Your hooker she can get stroked
And all of that
And later be back for your motherfuckin' dope sack
Kid it ain't the type of day to play grownup
Don't get your ass sewn up
Why you leakin' on my blown out
Hey, you're mixed up like a bowl of nuts
You fucked around and got it twisted up
Boy, don't get it twisted

[Hook]
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted

[Verse 2: Macadoshis]
It's the Macadoshis comin' from the dark side
The parkside where the O.G's hoo ride
Ain't nothin' but killas in the park
As many niggas lost they heart
When my gat sparks
I'll bust a cap in that ass
Don't get it twisted
When I'm on a mission, niggas come up missin'
You bustas gettin' disciplined
And you're comin' up short on your life
When I split you with this mac-10
When it's on it's on
Fuck it
I'm makin' niggas kick the bucket when I jack 'em for they duckets
Ain't no thing to let my shit spit
You on my shit list, punk you got a death wish
I tried to warn you but you missed it
You should have listened motherfucker when I said:
Don't get it twisted!

[Hook]
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted

[Verse 3: Rated R]
Niggas got problems about gettin' shit twisted
They need to stay the fuck out of grown folks business
Kids get a kick out of bumpin' their big lips
But don't front on shit an' won't no shit be started, uh!
Cause I'm a cold-hearted rider straight thuggin'
That's influenced by the streets
Never love nobody but my heat
East side brothers don't hear me though
They'd rather get shit twisted and gossip like hoes
Bitch made ass niggas what I call 'em
Couldn't bust a grape if they wanted
They're soft like Charmin
But I don't sweat varmints
I stomp 'em with my black boots
Just a one-day murder
On the motherfuckin' Rudy blue
I snatch ya souls up
Ain't no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
And your mommy can't save you now
Cause you done got twisted up
For fuckin' with a killa

[Hook]
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted nigga
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
Don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted
("You know who you're fuckin' with?")
