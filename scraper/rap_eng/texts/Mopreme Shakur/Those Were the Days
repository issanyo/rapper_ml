[Intro]
Now I want everybody to lift your little chocolate chip hands
And join along and sing along with me
Everybody say, “Alright, so right”
Everybody knows that those were the days
Alright, so right, everybody knows that those were the days

[Verse 1: Raphael Saadiq]
Starting at the age back when I was four
Having faith paid off, now we’re out on tour, that’s right
Every girl never had the time to call, yeah yeah
Now they claim to be my baby doll—ain’t that funny

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish times, I wish times had never changed
We’ve seen better days
I’m not trying, I’m not trying to drown the world
But we’ve all known that those were the days

[Chorus]
Alright, so right
Everybody knows that those were the days
Alright (all right), so right (so right)
Everybody knows that those were the days

[Verse 2: Raphael Saadiq]
Now I remember when having a dollar was fine
Today’s dollar’s not even worth a dime
And I remember going out was fun, yeah yeah
And now you can’t go out without packing a gun
(Ain’t that somethin’? You gotta pack a gat before you go out)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish times, I wish times had never changed
We’ve seen better days
I’m not trying, I’m not trying to drown the world
But we’ve all known that those were the days

[Chorus]
Everybody say alright (alright), so right (so right)
Everybody knows that those were the days
Alright (all right), so right (so right)
Everybody knows that those were the days

[Verse 3: Mocedes a.k.a. Mopreme Shakur]
Those were the days, way way back
We used to chill, just a bit more than relax
Slip outside, forget to lock your door
You know things’ll be cool but not anymore
So we keep trying and strengthening the fact
So we could bring those days back
Chillin’ outside, playing Tag or Red Rover
Wish those days weren’t over
Though we got a show in every single phase
How it was back in those days
(Those were the days) You know it
(Those were the days)

[Pre-Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
Now in times like these, you’ll hear anything
You know that’s right
(Everybody knows that those were the days)

[Chorus]
Alright (alright), so right (so right)
Everybody knows that those were the days
Alright (all right), so right (so right)
Everybody knows that those were the days
(Those were the days)
Alright (Those where the days), so right (all right)
Everybody knows that those were the days
Alright (all right), so right (so right)
Everybody knows that those were the days
(Those were the days)
Alright (Those where the days), so right
Everybody knows that those were the days
(Those were the days)
Alright, so right
Everybody knows that those were the days
(Those were the days)
Alright, so right
Everybody knows that those were the days
(Those were the days)
Alright (I remember when…), so right
Everybody knows that those were the days
(Those were the days)
Alright, so right (Those were the days)
Everybody knows that those were the days
