[Intro: Spoken]
Play this record as frequently as possible
Then, as it becomes easier for you
Play the record once a day or as needed

[Chorus]
It feels good, yeah
It feels good, woah
It feels good

It sho' feels good to me

If the rhythm feels good to you baby
Let me hear you say (oh oh baby)
If the rhythm feels good to you baby
Let me hear you say (oh oh baby)
If the rhythm feels good to you baby
Let me hear you say (oh oh baby)
And if the rhythm feels good to you baby
Let it take you away (oh oh baby)

Moments that we share
Special times alone
Just don't ever change
Cause I'm so into you
And you know

It feels good, yeah (to know that you by my side)
It feels good, woo (to know that you there for me)
It feels good, yeah (to know that you wanna be around)

[Verse 3: Mocedes]
Mocedes the Mellow, quite a nice fellow
Met 3T, hit a rhyme, acapello
They had the rhythm and I had the rhyme
So then a hit of that one more time
It worked out and then they worked it in
Tony! Toni! Ton√©! has done it again

[Chorus]
Feels good, yeah
It feels good
It feeeeels good
It feels good
It feels good
It feels good, yeah

I feel it all in my hands
I feel it all in my feet
I feel it all in my bones

I feel it all in my feet
I feel it all in my heart
I feel it all in my soul

And, you know
