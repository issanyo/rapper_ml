[Intro: 2Pac]
Mouse Man and The Wycked!
Yo, check this out
I need a verse from each of y'all and I'mma do a verse

[Chorus: sample]
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Mama raised me crazy
Critics should've killed me as a baby
Cause now I'm 21, you can't fade me
Yeah, I'm gettin' major paid, check my pager
Poppin' mo' game than a Sega
Sharp as a razor
Rollin' Cherokee and not a Blazer
Fuck the 5-0, watch for lasers
Infrared beam boomin' at ya dome cause it's on
One shot from the Glock and he's gone
Tell me: what goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty
Testin' 1, 2 , testin' 1, 2
Get a grip, bitch, come and get a whiff of this ol' slick shit
You think ya movin', but ya dreamin'
Nigga, "Oaktown, Oaktown" is what they screamin'
Uh, I'm doin' flicks, gettin' rich, fuck the Grammys
Hand on my jammy, word to granny
What goes on

[Chorus: sample]
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on

[Verse 2: The Wycked]
I gotta ask y'all a question:
What's the point of a nigga steppin' to the front
If ya plan is on 'fessing?
And I guess that some niggas don't know
Frontin' like a bitch have ya size double-cut low
I know a bro who stuck like Chuck in the middle of some shit
Always over grip
Scratchin' and make a nigga kill his momma
Pimp his son, step to his boy with a gun and a stun
Need to think that I could be a goner
Victim of an old school OC from the corner
I remember the days you used to meet me by the school
Playin' flies up
But, now, my niggas beggin' wit' a cup
So, when I got paid, I hit 'em off well
My old school G will lie for me or go to jail
But when it came time to show a true color
He was ghost and I was lyin' in the gutter
Ayo, now what's goin' on

[Chorus: sample]
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on

[Verse 3: Mouse Man]
The funk is on, all day and all night long, poppin' cops
'Til they drop, sideways to the next spot
Got my UZ hang, extra clip
In case some punk bitch wanna rip, he can get some of this
I duck and dodge longer than fifty niggas deeps in Jeeps
Smokin' marijuana, rather die than be dishonored
Bustin' left at the precinct and leach down low
Peelin' caps, so they know who's in control
I'm gonna see 'em on the door
Ra-ta-tat-ta-tat goes my TEC-9
Can't barely miss with dip, it's payin' back time
Harder for every jail than some police and these hypocrites
Equipped to kick a nigga's ass, hit the drop, move a hat quick
Shoot a cop for every blow, wish Rodney had a fo-fo
Smokin' cops like indo
So, then, maybe their friends know
Straight outta Oakland, pruck 'em, smoke 'em, make no tuck wit' 'em
Jackin' 'til the break of dawn
That's what really goes on

[Chorus + Outro: sample and back-voicing]
So what really goes on (what's goin' on)
So what really goes on
So what really goes on (what's goin' on)
So what really goes on
So what really goes on (what's goin' on)
So what really goes on
So what really goes on (what's goin' on)
So what really goes on
Dope fiends titty (tell me)
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
Colder than a dope fiend's titty
Can you tell me?
