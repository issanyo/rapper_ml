[Verse One] [Bishop Lamont]
I tell a bitch, bitch shut the fuck up quick
No I didn't I'm just kidding
Nigga but I'm so pimping
Oh how rude of me, for those that do not know of me
I Rembrandt paint that perfect picture nigga, with my poetry
I go by Bishop too, been known to toss a few
What you mean? Bitches? And a lot of special brews
Like it's '92
I miss that old shit
Message for the kids don't grow up too quick
You got your whole adult life to do some stupid shit
Speaking of stupid shit, I drink until I puke and shit
It's just a fly sunny day and everything is okay
Hop and dipping down that 1-10 freeway

[Hook]
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle business
Don't waste no time nigga, get your riches
Go 'head
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle business
Don't waste no time chasing dumb bitches
Why?
Cause she's a ho, she's a slut, she's a tramp, she's a freak
You can have a different one every day of the week
Hey

[Verse Two] [Mopreme Shakur]
On and on and on until the beat's gone
Rest in peace to all my niggas, Mopreme will carry on
Been around since the old days, no matter how a ho plays
Hold it down always
You know?
You check my resume, my pedigree is good to go
Speak on my game tuck your chain, it's a Thug Life show
I'm feeling politic and I'll spit with true players
Nothing but truth sayers so your bitch ass know
Screamin' Bishop once again with our foot on your throat
The way these bitches gag like they singing a note
I hit it from the back while she's sniffing on coke
I'm tryin' to enjoy my summer drop the top and smoke
Get it, don't stop, I'm hot
And I'm swoll like ho
L.A. is the dream and your ass is whoa

[Hook]
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle business
Don't waste no time nigga, get your riches
Go 'head
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle business
Don't waste no time chasing dumb bitches
Why?
Cause she's a ho, she's a slut, she's a tramp, she's a freak
You can have a different one every day of the week
Hey

[Verse Three] [Bishop Lamont]:
Now now I know my shit don't chase these bitches
But when these bitches chasing you now what's a player to do?
Adventure time like Finn and Jake, dog them hoes and penetrate
Get that money celebrate, stack them racks and elevate
Venice Beach and hit the streets, but first we hit them swap meets
Avalon, ?, Compton, Slauson bailin' hella deep
Ain't no tripping, set tripping, cause I'm never out there slippin'
War Doggz, Thug Life, till I die, we representin'
Mo'

[Mopreme Shakur]
I keep it pimping like it's old town
Run shit, all round, skyscrapers, flat land, it goes down
This is how a don with renegades on a run
Haters in my face that kill to take my place
My man Dos Equis is my boy he texts me
Bitches butt naked, in the sauna sexy
'Preme did his thing nigga
Call the next thing
And motherfuck anybody that be objecting

[Hook]
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle business
Don't waste no time nigga, get your riches
Go 'head
Don't stop gotta get it nigga handle business
Don't waste no time chasing dumb bitches
Why?
Cause she's a ho, she's a slut, she's a tramp, she's a freak
You can have a different one every day of the week
Hey
