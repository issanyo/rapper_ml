[Intro]
I Luv U 2Pac
I Luv U 2Pac and Kato
I Luv U 2Pac
Peace Out
(This for you Pac)

[Mopreme]
From local drug dealers, way up in the bay
To international crime boss' doing shit our way
Still just a legend to many, but he was also my brother
My roll dogg, and ? Shakur
We rose through these ranks, on weed straps and ?
91, 92, it was only a chosen few
Riding on our 4's, taking these niggas hoes
Chronic smoke through our nose, as the prophecies of the ? used to tell me more
Watch this little young nigga do it
Put his stamp on the game, we rolled and mashed to it
Realest nigga you could ever know, true soldier at heart
We all get off track some times and it so easy to fall apart
But I used to tell him, while my nigga sat in the pen
Ain't not peace in vengence, ain't no rest in revenge
Ain't no starting again, and for that simple fact
Its until these wheels fall off, until my nigga comes back

[Hook: Big Syke]x2
You'll carry on after the cowards are long gone
Family's staying strong and mom's holding on
Like you knew she would, wish I could bring you back
Trade places as a matter of fact

[Big Syke]
I seen the fire in your heart, from the start stayin true
Pick me ? killers and said look what the world has for you
I had no future thoughs, at the time anything goes
Now I'm rockin shows, fucking hoes, state to state
Let go of the wait, and the ?, now I see my dreams
Got me true when I'm a juvenile, now what I am supposed to do
But ride nigga ride till I reach the other side
Cause there is no where to hide in the world of haters
Perpertrators wastin they breath till theres none left
Thug Life to death, may you rest in peace my nigga
Cause love dont love no body
But I love you nigga, till they drop my body...in the dirt
