Pull up and park on the curb
Yo' bitch wanna fuck and she slurp
Droppin’ a four of that syrup
Give me them bricks, them birds
Pull up and park on the curb
Yo' bitch wanna fuck and she slurp
Droppin' a four of that syrup
Give me them bricks, them birds

[Chrous: Bhad Bhabie]
Wake up and do what I want
Wake up more cash than my mom
Wake up in new saint laurent
Yung and Bhad every night a party in france (woo)
Wake up and do what I want
Wake up and do what I want
Wake up more cash than my mom
Wake up in new saint laurent
Yung and Bhad every night a party in france (woo)
Wake up and do what I want

Shoot a nigga like Mad Max

Slide in the coupe (Slide)

Dont serve, wait until nobody shoot (No sir!)

He only love me and his money (and his money, baby)
This bitches playing, don’t be funny
Spent ten racks on a new chain
Dropped another stack on some new J's
Everyday my birthday, I got cake
Money on my line, hear my phone ring
And I go skrrt in my own lane
