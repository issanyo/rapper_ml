[Chorus]
You know I ain't fucking with no thot opps
I don't help these bitches, I don't throw Glocks
Cut these fucking hoes off like a chop block
Imma be around when they clout drop
You know you ain't gang, you ain't gang, you ain't gang
Please stay in yo lane, in yo lane, in yo lane
These dudes are the same, are the same, are the same
Please stay in yo lane, in yo lane, in yo lane

[Verse 1]
Fall back lil bitch
Who you fucking with
When we pull up
Bet she get to ducking quick
He dont want you lil hoe
You a hit and quick
Can't be fucking with these bitches
They some counterfiet
I just blocked these hoes now, I dont need to stress
Just don't waste no time on my phone, if it ain't about some fucking bread
Ain't no competition with these hoes, lil baby been a hit
Really shining in these streets, baby different from the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't chasing
I ain't waiting
All I care about is Franklins
I ain't scary, I ain't sneaky
Get your bitch, I see her geeking
I'm just grinding, Im just climbing
Dont wear my chain, but it got diamonds
Im a hustler, Im a savage
Want these problems, lets get active

[Chorus]
You know I ain't fucking with no thot opps
I don't help these bitches, I don't throw Glocks
Cut these fucking hoes off like a chop block
Imma be around when they clout drop
You know you ain't gang, you ain't gang, you ain't gang
Please stay in yo lane, in yo lane, in yo lane
These dudes are the same, are the same, are the same
Please stay in yo lane, in yo lane, in yo lane

[Chorus 2 - Bout that]
Bitch I'm 'bout that
Bitch I'm 'bout that
Bitch I'm 'bout that shit
Bitch I'm 'bout that
You a scary hoe
But you won't fight me though
You a copycat
But you ain't like me hoe
Bitch I'm 'bout that
Bitch I'm 'bout that
Bitch I'm 'bout that shit, bitch
Bitch I'm 'bout that
You a scary hoe
But you won't fight me though
You a copycat
But you ain't like me hoe

[Verse 2 - Bout that]
Came out with no earrings on
I bought that house, my shoes off
In my driveway with that tough talk
Chase sheds, slice sheds
Get your hoe don't fuck it
Imma run up on that bitch
Bentley truck, imma run over that bitch
Come out and roar, ain't got no ?
I'm on yo head, ima snatch wigs off you bitches
This that pay per view
If you fight me hoe, then you get hella views
Imma beat yo ass, then put up an ad
Then I'm posting that, thas a hunnit racks
