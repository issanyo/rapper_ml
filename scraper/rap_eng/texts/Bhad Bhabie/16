16 - Official Lyrics

{Intro}
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Happy

{Verse 1}
(Been) balling like Charles Barkley
Getting gnarly, cocky, you can’t guard me
Now I’m stalling to acknowledge the fact
That I’ll never be what mama wants me to be
A doc, ha, no I’ll go adopting
My passion, exactly not part of the posse
Pausing, to reflect on my past, I’m sorry
If I’ve ever left a scar on you, I’m exhausted
Been accused falsely of many things
Stealing, lying, cheating, haven’t we done them all?
That’s one reason I’m gonna stop making tracks for a bit
So I can concentrate on stopping that meme from starting
I mean, it wasn’t anything, I’ve been called a joke
A laughingstock, shoulda invested on those
Never mind, I’ll climb the ropes, tie you guys to the post
Mind if you know, I’ll undermine you moles!
Life is like a minefield, not Minecraft, a minefield
Got me stepping around like I got high heels
It’s a journey, got me laughing, watching Seinfeld
It’s time that I go reap my yield (harvest)
Pile up the shit that I’ve been coming up on
Guess I gotta wait a while ‘til I drop a new song
Got me typing, switching styles like the fonts
Gotta find my outlet, plug it in, now I’m charged, dawg
Yeah, been I’m always in a war, caught in the crossfire
Always felt conformed, they never gave me some alone time
So I’ve been getting tougher ever since I dropped Tough Life
Man that was a hit, jabs better than a punchline!
Now I’m looking back, at the things that were once mine
All the dirt, and the hurt, now I’ve been sucked dry
Gotta re-energize, gotta exercise
My mind’s been blank for a bit, gotta write a better line!
Taking a break, hope you get what I’m saying
Plainly stating the fact that I’m trash, maybe
I’ll come back with a track to drop on those Bad Poets
Who think they know shit, fuck! You’ll never seize the moment!
You know what? Sure I am a young buck
But I’ve fucking had it, stupid, stupid, dumb mutts
Just saying, if you hate my music
Don’t listen to it!
Don’t abuse it, no fuck!

{Chorus}
I’ve been giving back, since I was born (born)
Gimme that back, I was rich but now I’m poor (I’m poor)
Knife at the wall, tryna find a door (find a door)
Get me outta here, this life is a damn horror (damn horror)
I’ve been giving back, since I was born (born)
Gimme that back, I was rich but now I’m poor (I’m poor)
Knife at the wall, tryna find a door (find a door)
Get me outta here, this life is a damn horror (damn horror)

{Verse 2}
I remember those times when I was young
Living out life, so fine that was
Now I look back, seeing the life that I’m living
Today, feels like time’s slipping away
Seems like I’ve gone cold, turned real icy
Ice in my veins, not chill, I’m too spicy
For my liking, might be a sign that
The good times are passing by, think I gotta cling onto
My memories, they’re all jumping off the boat
Telling me, it’s time to go on with life and part ways
I’m like, okay, but this shit has scarred me
Took it way too far, in the dark, I’m marked up, aye
Pardon me, I am not okay
With this bullshit, mutiny on display
All the hate, think I can’t take no more
From my mom to the racists, mocking my name
Ain’t been living my life to the fullest
Always got problems, first world bullshit
Spilling bills out of the purse, spitting out the verses
Chill my boy, chill, get a fill, don’t be cursing
Fuck love, thanks X for the mic talk
Made me think about life, made me liable
Suicidal,  ain’t playing games, this is my job
Waiting for the day I land a label, my arrival
If I ever get a girlfriend, she’ll be from Florida
Explore a bit, browsing Tinder for some flora
Get my agent, Scotty Boras, notorious for being hard
I don’t even think I have heart, so I’ll pick it apart
I’m the brain, that’ll set the world on fire
The spark, ready to go and change the world
Climb to new heights, breaking records like Peyton, (18)
Colts and Broncos should’ve been thankful
To have been playing with the greatest, yeah

{Chorus}
I’ve been giving back, since I was born (born)
Gimme that back, I was rich but now I’m poor (I’m poor)
Knife at the wall, tryna find a door (find a door)
Get me outta here, this life is a damn horror (damn horror)
I’ve been giving back, since I was born (born)
Gimme that back, I was rich but now I’m poor (I’m poor)
Knife at the wall, tryna find a door (find a door)
Get me outta here, this life is a damn horror (damn horror)
I’ve been giving back, since I was born (born)
Gimme that back, I was rich but now I’m poor (I’m poor)
Knife at the wall, tryna find a door (find a door)
Get me outta here, this life is a damn horror (damn horror)
I’ve been giving back, since I was born (born)
Gimme that back, I was rich but now I’m poor (I’m poor)
Knife at the wall, tryna find a door (find a door)
Get me outta here, this life is a damn horror (damn horror)

{Mantra Bridge}
Birthday, Curse Day
First day, worst Day
Shirt stained, nurse, aye
Stitch me up, stitch me up
Stitch me up
I need help, aye
Dawg, aye
Birthday, Curse Day
First day, worst Day
Shirt stained, nurse, aye

{Outro}
Yuh-ah
Oh yuh
Oh yuh, yuh
