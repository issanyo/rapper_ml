[Intro]
Oh my God, Ronny

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
I do not sniff it or roll it (no)
It do not drip when I pour it (no)
I do not run, I reload it
I do not save it, I throw it
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch

[Verse 1: MoneyatMidnight]
Hi bich, more like bye bitch
I'm not a free sample so you don't wanna try bitch
Keep playing with me Imma make yo ass cry bitch
Who the fuck do you think you talking too
Found a dusty ass bitch somebody please go get the broom
Man that hoe was hella funny, tryna play with my money
Niggas bitchin and they uptight
They always in they feelings, never know when something right
Saw best friend like hi bich, let's get rich
Let's make a couple million or some shit
Hold up, the bitch talking shit?
Pull up Terrence howard, whoop dat trick
Stomp that bitch, choke that hoe
Woah woah whoa, I'm freak on high
New keys to the new Porsche parked right outside
White lines white guy and we both high
I bout to get my license come on lets ride
Try to fuck with me, definition suicide
Girls try to play with me, I had to to let the bitch know
Call my girls have your weave on the floor
Man that hoe had to go, hoe was so messy
Bitch is a snitch, run as soon as you tell it
Post your business all on instagram
Now they know everything about your fam
Everybody so fake, and they all up in your face like
Hi bitch, bye bitch

[Interlude: Bhad Bhabie]
Bitch!
You mad, ho
Why you so mad, ho?

[Verse 4: Bhad Bhabie]
Ho, don't wanna try me
Yeah, that's on my mama's chromosome
Commas run on 10, since I run it up
Never wanna line up, I don't do McDonald's
Fuck crazy you know I'm breakin' necks when I'm pullin' up (skrrt)
All my numbers lookin' outrageous
Now the blogs handin' out praises
Got the world usin' my phrases
Hoes keep my name in their mouth
Hope it tastes like shit when they say it (don't say my name, bitch)
Barrin' out, I ain't got Xans in me, no
Young but I'm ballin' like a damn CEO
Bentley truck, said don't give a fuck
Came from the street, Boynton Beach
Yeah, they know what's up
Bitches that hold no position
Come at me, fall in my mentions
Hoes be thirsty for attention
Knock a ho out this dimension
Then continue my ascension (why you so mad?)
How you hoes livin' with no purpose?
I be pumpin' venom in my verses
Bitch, you worthless
You ain't fuckin' with my worst shit
Doubted me, now it's all comin' together like cursive
(like cursive, bitch)
$50K a show, I'm doin' 30 of 'em
5 million by the summer, keep the numbers runnin'
Bitches showin' everything, I be understuntin' (damn)
Understandin' your regard, really had nothin' (shit)
Shit, but now I'm breakin' records and I'm makin' history (wow)
How can they stop me? I swear it's a mystery
Parents so sick of me, source of their misery
(Let your kids listen to me!)
Ho, I do millions on a slow day
And I ain't gotta go to school like a snow day
But my... in the stu' so it's okay
Bank account look like a lick
Broke ho, you look like you sick
Slide on the beat like it's slick
Bitch don't compare me to Iggy
That old ho is washed and I'm lit
Wouldn't pay her to wash up my whip
(Bye, broke bitch, bye, ho!)

[Chorus: Bhad Bhabie]
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
I do not sniff it or roll it (no)
It do not drip when I pour it (no)
I do not run, I reload it
I do not save it, I throw it
White J's, white Porsche
White wrist, white horse
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
Hi, bitch, hi, bitch
