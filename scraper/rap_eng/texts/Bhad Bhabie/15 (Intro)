[Verse 1]
My 15 minutes stretching some hours late
Bring me 15 bitches, I'll make 'em salivate
15 million right on my fuckin' plate
BOA, 15 hundred just to feast safe
15 feeling like I won a sweepstakes
15-hour flights when I leave the states
15 thousand dollars on a bracelet
Had to buy two, I had the jeweler going apeshit
Old friends doing 15 to life
I changed my situation with some pristine advice
Name a rapper hot as me, I'm 15 times the hype
My bank account holds 15 times your life
15 cars like I'm collecting those
15 Fashion Nova packs, I'm collecting clothes
Fan love 'cross the map, getting X and Os
15 bodyguards in my section, closed

[Chorus]
15, 15, rose up from the depths, now I live a dream
15, 15, making history, this shit something they never seen

[Verse 2]
15 bad bitches, send a UberX
15 bitches mad I get uber checks
15 hunned Bhabies by the mosh pit
Rap star, living life for my rock shit
Like a pop shift, 15 in the Glock, bitch
Think you hot shit? Get you 15 knots, quick
That's a lump sum, sweaty bitches Trump dumb
15 shots to that head, I get 'em punch drunk
15 milli stalking that IG
So why in the fuck would I need a ID?
Hoes looking thirsty, get on my IV
Voice of the new generation, you can't deny me
Tape dropping September, I hope you hoes ready
15, Black Mamba, shit gon' be so deadly
(Tape dropping September, I hope you hoes ready
Bust 15 tons, this shit is so heavy)

[Chorus]
15, 15, rose up from the depths, now I live a dream
15, 15, making history, this shit something they never seen
