You live in a home
With running water and a
Air conditioner and T.V
You have nothing to give and
You have nothing to say
So you sing-a-ling-a-long
Everything is alright
How can one person change the world?
I have to pay my bills
I gotta go to work
The earth is dying
I am so ashamed
We are all to blame
We must raise human consciousness

I want to be up high up with the sun
Disappear completely into love
I want to be up high up where I can
See the secret roads

All you selfish people
Who think of nothing but money
Realize how angry and stressed
You are all the time
When you're angry you only see things
From a bad angle
That's why you are going crazy
That why you feel like shit
You'll never find true happiness
In this state of mind

I want to be up high up with the sun
Disappear completely into love
I want to be up high up where I can
See the secret roads

What's most important is
Where we were born, where we grow
Where we live
Without Earth we are extinct
Instead of finding ways to live on other planets
We have to find a way to live on our own
Instead of spending so much money on sending space shuttles into space and making weapons for war
Why don't we use it for making solar electricity, homes, cars, appliances
Someone is going to have to give in
Somebody is going to lose money
But we can't be greedy, we can't be lazy
We have to learn to give and help each other
And rise about this world we created
Rise above fear
We need to share to save the human race
Take the human race into a higher vibration

I want to be up high up with the sun
Disappear completely into love
I want to be up high up where I can
See the secret roads
