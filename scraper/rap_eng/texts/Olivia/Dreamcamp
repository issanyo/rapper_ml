It's so easy to get lost in this
Lovely brutal world

I must go to sleep
So I can scream as loud as I want
Without attention
I must go to sleep
So I can follow the whispers
To my dreams

Come back into the world shiny and new
I will meet you there when everything's okay
We'll have a good old time together
I'll have new ideas
I'll be able to laugh
I'll be able to love myself

I float on the water
Trying to find a direction
A place meant for me

It's time to sleep
I feel tears over-flowing
My emotions

Come back into the world shiny and new
I will meet you there when everything's okay
We'll have a good old time together
I'll have new ideas
I'll be able to laugh
I'll be able to love myself
