I don't wanna play ith your feelings girl
Gotta be honest with you
I been lieing to you
I've already gotta a girl
And im suprised all this time you couldn't tell
Thats why ma fone is alwayz off
And you gettin the voice mail
I don't wanna lose you at all
But i love you both
And whats funny is i think i love you the most
Im so into you, something bout you, i'm feeling like i'm nothing without you

Olivia:
Im so into you baby
Its so hit like sugar

Maino:
You Right
I Know Man
Listen...
Yo..I can see us settleing down and you having ma baby boy
But i can't leave her she got ma baby boy
But deep down still i wanna be your baby boy
Man i feel like Joey in Baby Boy
You don't realise that hurt you and im ashamed off it
Got a tattoo on ya breasts with ma name on it
Girlfriend i'm so selfish its true
I want ma cake and be bale to eat it to

Olivia:
Im so into you baby
Its so hit like sugar
