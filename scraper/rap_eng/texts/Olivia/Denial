Little owls bring me messages
Transparent envelopes
Given by black daisies
And through enormous telescopes
Addressed the white crow
Sent it out
Was it meant to get to me?

I can hear you
I'm just playing it cool
Bones quiver gently
Vexing blood river
Flux to the tip of my feathers
I laugh at your eagerness
Fruitful dandelion heartache is repelling you yet
How am I to turn around on my own?
Who's to blame
For what has become?

That makes me cry
That makes me cry, she says
She says
(Oh no~)

Do you wanna be in denial?
You wanna be in denial?
Must I sacrifice this heart
To live this life, the picture?

Keep on holding on
I want to be around love

Wondrous wondrous
Stars of the night
Make all the fury go out of sight
Accord me the strength
Send it out
Send it out
Send it out

Your violence is trickling inside me
Yet I'm to remain halcyon

Your mind over my body
You're taking over my sleep
You're taking over my...
(Oh no~) sleep

Do you wanna be in denial?
You wanna be in denial?
Must I sacrifice this heart
To live this life, the picture?

Keep on holding on
I want to be around love
