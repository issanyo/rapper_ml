Child of the sun
Changing with the sky
Sakura shy
December clouds cry

Illuminant light illuminate me
Illuminant light illuminate me

Play me a symphony
Dance with me

Child of the moon
Changing with the tide
Up and down
The seashore side

Illuminant light illuminate me
Illuminant light illuminate me

With you I find
What is me
