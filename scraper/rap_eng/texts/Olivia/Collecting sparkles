Darling, I'm eager
To know of your everlasting beam
My melancholy drama has
Ultimately puzzled me
What is it that you do
That makes you the way you are
I keep my eye on you
Watch what you do

Explode!
The ground begins to tremble
Everybody's screaming
No matter how chaotic
You always come to show me

Collect sparkles
In a catastrophe all you can is a shine
You pick it up
Collect sparkles
You find them everywhere
They're recognized by you
Giving your love to them

Catch a sparkle
Before you let a flaw
Steal this wondrous moment
Walls close in on you
It's easy getting caught into
But when you let them get to you
You'll only see
One in a million things

Shame!
That you could strip yourself from this
Luscious universe
Wake yourself to this
Immense luxury

Collect sparkles
I put them in my pocket
They melt into me
Feeding me shine
Collect sparkles
Twinkle in my eye and back to the origin
Carrying my heart to

Collect sparkles
In a catastrophe all you can see is shine
You pick it up
Collect sparkles
You find them everywhere
They're recognized by you
Giving your love to them
