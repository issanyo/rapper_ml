He was made to join you
When you were getting started
He became part of your team
And you just didn't like it

When he went to have some fun
You guys just got jealous
You declared him null and void
He was nothing in your eyes

Three of you get back together
Leave him out 'cause you were bitter
You just want to be a trio
Bestest friends in a group photo

Got your girlfriend to slag him
Shows you didn't value him
Awesome that he stands alone
'Cause you just get under his skin

Get down from your high horses
'Cause your falsettos can't make up
For the hurt that you did to him
'Cause of your petty bitterness

If you don't accept him
You're gonna be known as
The boyband who's pissed off
'Cause he's not with you anymore

You just leave him out
Clap your hands 'cause you leave him out
Are you famous now?
Clap your hands 'cause you left him out (x2)
