Kiss your trophy
Glazed honey de luxe
Your coal of instant sparkle
Leave all your things behind
They will not be of any use

果てしない可能性の空間で
躍って自分のステップで

Don't look back
Don't, don't, da-don't look back
Don't run ahead
Don't, don't, don't run ahead

(Come on and shake it now)
Let go oh baby
(Come on and do it now)
Go oh baby
(Come on and shake it now)
Let go oh baby
(Come on and do it now)
Go oh baby
(Come on and shake it now)

Mosquitos printed in your mind
Start asking you favors
As you were having discussions
They secretly sipped your day hollow

心の中に在ること
気付く瞬間トキハナタレル

Don't look back
Don't, don't, da-don't look back
Don't run ahead
Don't, don't, don't run ahead

(Come on and shake it now)
Let go oh baby
(Come on and do it now)
Go oh baby
(Come on and shake it now)
Let go oh baby
(Come on and do it now)
Go oh baby
(Come on and shake it now)
