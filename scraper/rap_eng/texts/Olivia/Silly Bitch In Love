Spoken:huh there's 2 things you dont fuck wit
A girl's dough and her heart
So I'm here to let ya'll niggas know fa sho

Verse 1:Gave you my money let you push my Benz
Up in my 600 chillin wit yo friends
Boy I gave you everything you need yes I was
Silly Bitch in love ohh
All of my girls say "he's playin you"
But I said " mind yo business cuz that ain't true"
Boy you had me twisted and all confused no more am I
Silly Bitch in love ohh

Chorus:
I was so silly
I was wide open
Lost in love
Silly bitch in love ohhh

Verse 2:You had a dime but you cashed it in
I let you play me again and again
How many night's must I caress myself yes I was.......
Silly bitch in love ohh
Do you remember all the time you spent
Out all night jus clubin comin home and then
I still gave you my lips my hips all of my chips I guess I was
Silly bitch in love ohhh
Had you draped dolce and a iced out rolley
Foolish enough to believe anything you told me
Threw you like a pogo and you got my all cause my love was the toss and you had me lost
Silly bitch in love ohh

You had other bitches in my car
Go 'head keep the roly and the benze
And you had other bitches wearin my bra
I ain't mad , I ain't mad
Nigga you ain't know u was fuckin wit a star
I ain't mad, I ain't mad
Ain't nan bitch puttin up wit that silly shit no mo nigga you out the door

Chorus (fade out)
