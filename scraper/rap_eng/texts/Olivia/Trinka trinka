No one is around
Your making it all up
It's time to disarm yourself
Because when you are free
And act naturally
Something begins to happen

Slowly I see you
Wake out of a very serious snooz'in
Right eye, left eye
I feel like on the verge of a big surprise

I'm feeling trinka trinka
It's really happening
My heart is beating steady
But I want to scream!
Internal carousel cues an upright rainbow
Sending out a friendly glimmer

I'm feeling trinka trinka
It's really happening
My heart is beating steady
But I want to scream!
Calling out on a big shift
It knows we are laughing
Together we laugh

This space is open
You're creating in it
I know when you're doing it with joy
Because it has a shine
That no words can explain
It reaches out and touches me

In your rhythm
Some may not understand what you are doing
Oh! behave! now
All of a sudden anything seems possible

I'm feeling trinka trinka
It's really happening
My heart is beating steady
But I want to scream!
Possibilities inspiration galore
Inhale and exhale at the same time

I'm feeling trinka trinka
It's really happening
My heart is beating steady
But I want to scream!
Look what is found
So much to discover
It's never over
