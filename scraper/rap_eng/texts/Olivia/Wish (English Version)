Vibrations you present
Startles my understanding
A challenge to my ordinary
Unusual to find such a special curiosity
I hold my breath to still the excitement

Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Parallel connection hiding out
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart
Undisciplined eruption

Baby I know it's coming around
I'm totally upside down
I can't get it together to tell you what I feel
Baby my wish on a wing
And I'll send it off to you
Switch to sensitivity
Follow the traces

I can't pull away from you
You steel all my attention
Sometimes too much that I feel empty
I have to fill it back up
So I can shine my brightest
It'll leak out further into your heart

Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
My eyes link to your blink
Pulling on my heart
Pulling on my heart
Feeling me natural and extreme

Baby my world is crumbling down
I'm totally upside down
My words are stuck inside of this stubborn heart
Baby my wish on a wing
And I'll send it off to you
It floats in the air
Sorrowful without you

Baby I know it's coming around
I'm totally upside down
I can't get it together to tell you what I feel
Baby my wish on a wing
And I'll send it off to you
Switch to sensitivity
Follow the traces

Baby my world is crumbling down
I'm totally upside down
My words are stuck inside of this stubborn heart
Baby my wish on a wing
And I'll send it off to you
It floats in the air
Sorrowful without you
