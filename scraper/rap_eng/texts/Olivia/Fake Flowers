Farmers in the mid-west need good land
For their work so they can grow flowers
Farmers in the mid-west need good land
For their work so they can grow flowers

Crouch down between the walls
Bundled up nice and small
You walk in with your graceful smile
And ask me to grow you a beautiful flower

Farmers in the mid-west need good land
(Please tell me you're not serious)
For their work so they can grow flowers
(It's not fair)
Farmers in the mid-west need good land

They want me to grow up
Follow the fucking laws
So I can live on Earth
So I can provide them with
A beautiful flower

How's it gonna grow
You expect it to grow
How's it gonna grow
You expect it to grow
