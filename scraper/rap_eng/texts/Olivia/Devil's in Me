The devil is in me, in me
The devil is in me, in me
The devil is in me, in me
Oh no

I must hunt you down
Locate your breeding ground
Inject it with applesauce
Dislocate its shoulder bone

The rupture twisted my spectrum
Masked my reason
Reversed my revelation

I have to fish it out
I have to mend it up
And I got to throw it back
I have to be on my way
I have to be on my way

The devil is in me, in me
The devil is in me, in me
The devil is in me, in me
Oh no

Shadow your travels
To the way that you preach
Penetrate the vessels
Then detach the saddle

The rupture twisted my spectrum
Masked my reason
Reversed my revelation

I have to fight you off
I have to win in out
Can't be lackadaisical
I have to be on my way
I have to be on my way
