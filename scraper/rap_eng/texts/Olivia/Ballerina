優雅に踊る in a 無傷の Diamond
Where it protects her

涙と pink marigold dreams
はざ間でもがく彼女は
太陽を振り向かせる
It lights the stage for her

Ballerina
Show them who you are
Ballerina
Show them who you are

You have been waiting for this
Isn't this what you wanted?
Why are you crying?

現実と glass oil paintings
間で生きる彼女を
誰も理解しようとしない
They are afraid of chance

Ballerina
Show them who you are
Ballerina
Show them who you are

涙と pink marigold dreams
はざ間でもがく彼女は
太陽を振り向かせる
It lights the stage for her
