[Verse 1:]
I know it can't be real
This must be a dream
I open up my eyes to find
That you're not here with me

So I tell myself that
It's not the end
I just can't take the thought
I'm never holding you again

Remember all those times
I held you when you cried (cried)
Somehow we turned
Them tears to laughter

I have to wonder why
You never said goodbye
So many questions
Still unanswered (whoa)

[Chorus:]
I'm broken
It's my turn to cry
But I'm wondering
Who will bring me flowers
This time (ooooh whoa)

It my turn to cry
But im wondering
Who will bring me flowers this time?
(This time, yeah, ha)

[Verse 2:]
Took your photographs
Put them all away
'Cause it hurt so bad
Every time I see your face

But in the middle of the night
I sit up in my bed
I just can't erase
The picture of you in my head

No matter how I try
To put the past behind (ooh yeah yeah)
There's no happy ending after

I have to wonder
Why you never (no no no) said goodbye
So many questions
Still unanswered (oooh)

[Repeat Chorus:]

I can't sleep
Feel [?]
Feel with me

Why u have to
Go away lonely
I miss you

[Repeat Chorus 2x:]
