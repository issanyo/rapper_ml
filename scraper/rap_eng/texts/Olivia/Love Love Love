I see you hiding with your tears
This song is written for you
It bends into your story
Everytime it’s played over

Energy lifts up from the trees, my heart
Fitting the ears listening

A golden glitter thread weaving
Into the garment of tears
Spinning and releasing your thoughts
Untucking the moment from your heart

Love Love Love
Here they come, my lambent fireflies
Surrounding you, lighting up your trail
Love Love Love
Close your eyes, we’re all under the same sky
You have me
Whoever you are
I love you

Everyone is included
Take your time if you need rest
Fall asleep, I’ll watch over you
You’ll wake when you’ve had enough

Energy lifts up from the soil, flowers
Turning distress to strength

Whatever you do, don’t give a damn what they say
You are wonderful just the way you are
Can’t stop what’s coming your way

Love Love Love
From highlands whispering out, calling your name
Brightening your north star
Love Love Love
Close your eyes, let’s dance together all night
You don’t need anything
This is real to me

Love Love Love
From highlands whispering out, calling your name
Brightening your north star
Love Love Love
Here they come, my lambent fireflies
Surrounding you, lighting up your trail
Love Love Love
Close your eyes
We’re all under the same sky
You have me
Whoever you are
I love you
