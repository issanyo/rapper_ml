[Verse 1:]
The places brings back memories
As I walk by quiet streams
The caress of a wind blowing over me
Brings a chill to my skin
Whispers that go through the trees
And a hush comes over me
No way to fight the rush
Can't escape how we touch

[Bridge:]
As the cherry blossoms slowy start
To reminisce the love we made
I can feel you in my arms
Gotta run to you

[Hook:]
I keep having these visions of you
Breaking me off like a lover should do
Remember the love in the pouring rain
Then it's on again
Video plays all over my body
I hope sex is all over your mind
The catches may change but the secret's the same and it's on again

[Verse 2:]
The secret place you touched me there
Are so unforgetable
Ain't no way I can ease all the visions of you
Our love's so unbelievable
You touched me softly, deeply like a woman needs
All I want, all I breathe even though I am...

[Verse 3:]
Walking through quiet places
Brings back memories of the love we shared
(remember that time by the waterfall)
Lost in those faded pictures (faded pictures)
Sexy whispers, and then I know it's on again
I know it's on again...
