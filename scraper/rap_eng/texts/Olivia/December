[Verse 1]
Who am I to you, where do we stand are you my man?
You told me you were through and you were leaving her for me.
But it doesn't seem that way, we made plans some time ago
Keep putting me on hold.
And on top of all this mess
Word is getting back to me
You never claimed me.

[Chorus]
Ain't what I heard you said you loved me in December
It ain't what I heard you said you loved me in
December I remember.

[Verse 2]
Please come and save the day, say I'm the one you love
This all a big mistake, and I don't wanna play the fool of giving up a lot of me
For you-uu-uu
How can you let this be?, how can you not defend me?
Are my eyes deceiving me? noo-ooo-ooo
Is there a possibility, is it true what they're saying, I won't believe it.

[Chorus]
It ain't what I heard you said you loved me in December ohhhh
It ain't what I heard you said you loved me in December I remember
So it ain't what I heard you said you loved me in December
Oh it ain't what I heard you said you loved me in December I remember.

[low voice]
Who am I to
Who am I to you

Did I ever mean a thing?

[low voice]
I trusted you, I was such a fool

No you never meant one word you said
No I don't believe it, how could you erase me
All the promises that wasted time.
No I don't believe it, you said that you needed me then you turned right around and just lied.

[Chorus x2]

So it ain't what I heard you said you loved me in December.
Oh it ain't what I heard you said you loved me in December, I remember

Ohhhhh ohhhhh loved me in December
Ohhhhh ohhhhh baby I remember..
