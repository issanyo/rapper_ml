[Hook: Mavado]
Yeah, yeah
I'm singing for my soldier girl
She's always on my mind
She only done for me when I'm in jail doing time
Yes, she's my soldier girl
She's my sunshine
Yes, she's always there for me in the toughest times

[Verse 1: Mavado]
See, we've been through so many things that brings close to that
I'm a Romeo, she's my Juliet!
As this world getting colder, she stay with me
Shoulder to shoulder, she's my queen, she's my lover
Without you my life gets over!

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Olivia]
See, I don't mind being your one and only
Still I.. what you do in time, waiting on me!
At a drop of a dime, I give it all up and trade places with you babe
Don't wanna see you hurting, no baby!

(I'm singing for my soldier girl)
I'll be your soldier girl!
(Close my world, oh, oh )
Oh, forever your soldier!

[Hook: Mavado + Olivia]
I'm singing for my soldier girl
(I'm your soldier girl)
She's always on my mind
(Always on your mind)
She only done for me when I'm in jail doing time
Yes, she's my soldier girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah )
She's my sunshine
(I'm your sunshine)
Yes, she's always there for me when...
(I'll be your soldier girl!)

[Verse 3: Mavado]
So I know you know you're my special lady
I know you know you're so divine!
[Olivia:]
So I know you know you're my special baby
I know you know you're so divine!
