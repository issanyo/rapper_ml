Should Of Known Better Than To Hear Your Lies
Should Of Known You Would Only Make Me Cry
Should Of Known You Was Too Good To be True
Should Of Known I Was Too Good For You
No One Every Made Me Feel this Way
I Lost Myself In You From The Very First Day
Now I'm Left Feeling So Confused
What Am I Gonna Do....

(Hook)
Should Igo Should I Stay I Don't Know
This Is What I Ask Myself
Call Me A Fool For Loving You
Please Tell Me WHere do I Go From Here
Where do I Go Where do I go from here
Where Do I Go

Tell Me How Did We End Up This Way
Never Miss A Good Thing Till Its Gone Away
Sitting Here Trying To Reason with Myself
When you were Here Thinking About Someone Else
Saying Your Sorry Won't Take Away The Pain
Seems We'll Never Ever Be The Same
Cause I Was Your Everything And You Were My Everything
And You Got My Heart You See Babbbyyyy

(Hook)
Should IGo Should  I Stay I Don't Know
This Is What I Ask Myself
Call Me A Fool For Loving You
BABY Tell Me Where do I Go From Here
Where do I Go Where do I go from here
Where Do I Go

I Don't Really Wanna Say Bye Bye
Theres So Many Reasons Why
I Don't Ever Wanna, Loose Your Love Baby
When Trust Walks Right Out The Door
It Makes It So Hard To Believe You Any More
This Shouldn't Be ......
Ohh Baby Tell Me......


Where do I Go From Here
Where do I Go Where do I go from here
Where Do I Go Where Do I Go From Here
WHere Do I Go Where Do I Go From here
Where Do I Go Where Do I Go From Here
WHere Do I Go Where Do I Go From Here
Where Do I Go ....Where Do I Go From Here
Where DO I Go ..................
