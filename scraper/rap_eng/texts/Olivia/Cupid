In emergencies
I close my eyes
And I see a ghost
I flutter to the light
And pray for lucidity

I can't keep waiting for you
I can't keep expecting you

Folding
The sun is turning inside-out of the universe so Cupid Cupid
Please aim your arrow at my sleeping flower
One time
Cupid Cupid
I, won't take it for granted

I wonder about
With my perfume puff
Skipping on the trails
Of broken candy cane

I can't keep waiting for you
I can't keep expecting you

Folding
The sun is turning inside-out of the universe so
Cupid Cupid
Please aim your arrow at my sleeping flower
Once more
Cupid Cupid

I can't keep waiting for you
I can't keep expecting you
