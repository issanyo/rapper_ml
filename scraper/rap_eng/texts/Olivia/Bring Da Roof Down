[Hook:]
Two in the morning and you're ready to rock
I got my ladies sitting at the bar doing it up
So just give up the cash, nigga no you ain't gettin' no ass
Two in the morning and you're ready to rock
I got my ladies at the bar doing it up
So just give up the cash, nigga just pour crystal in my glass

[Verse 1:]
Take my keys to my 2K Jaguar please
Park it next to the cherry red Benz
The one with the hoodie and all his friends
VIP check the list it's me plus 3
Now we're in and the drink's on me until we're dizzy
So pissy, get on the floor, throw on some biggie
I'm gon' spend all ya endz, nigga we some prada Mommas
Fine ass figgas with them doped up na-nas
Mr.OT sale a coke in ocabonas
Late night fee, splurshin' off give me Hondas
Swurvin' off in a suburban, sipin' burban
Urban tryin' not to hit the curbin'

[Hook:]
Two in the morning and you're ready to rock
I got my ladies sitting at the bar doing it up
So just give up the cash, nigga no you ain't gettin' no ass
Two in the morning and you're ready to rock
I got my ladies at the bar doing it up
So just give up the cash, nigga just pour crystal in my glass

[Verse 2:]
Lil' Momma gonna show y'all how to floss in the 4
With the top down, nigga's drawers drop at the do'
We rock Prada, Chanel and Fendi nigga
You sport fosco, how you gon' fend me nigga?
Let alone afford me, I broke pockets ballin'
I pimp smack ya girl, y'all niggas still applaud me
Gangsta please, wit' yo jeans a bit too creased
Step away from the hot girls please
Your breathe smells like Sushi
Fake brothas, broke down brothas
Pull ya shoes up, ya pants too snuff my brotha
Little dickie, so ya gotta lickie-lickie
Back yo ass up, fo' I slip you a mickey

[Hook:]
Two in the morning and you're ready to rock

So just give up the cash, nigga no you ain't gettin' no ass
Two in the morning and you're ready to rock

So just give up the cash, nigga just pour crystal in my glass
Two in the morning and you're ready to rock
