Do you sense? are you aware? Love Do you care?
Did you enjoy your walk?
Move your body laugh and talk? Did you notice?
A message a guide an opening of a path
Did you hear? Fill your ears Someone Dear
Tremolo, taiko, arpegio, kokoro, ashiato, Radio, Piano, arigatou
Did you see? mabushii? Sweet & Sour Sunflower
Feel everydrop of your shower? ame no azabujuuban undone, no-sun
Communication making a connection
You & me Synchronicity shinjiaeta michi
Morning mist in the air Where were you when I was there?
Because I wanted to share Everything, Everywhere

Oh Did you see it? everyminute Did you see it? everyminute
Did you see it? Did you see it?

Let's go Slow Mo' Let's go Slow Mo'
It's what you make it It's how you see it
It's how you take it It's your own design

Do you sense? are you aware? Love Do you care?
Let's go just to see the rainbow Let's just go kake ni ikou
Let's forget where we have to go and go where we want to go
We're out of sight take a flight into light
That warm comforting Paradise Heaven you see
Aoku kagayaki utsukushii in your dreams all that you were looking for
Where you can't wait to arrive Is here
Right in front of you all that you fear disappears
You open to now & here
My rescue yellow surround we float above
Let's be ourselves sing dance
Go with what you feel, be real

Oh Do you see it? everyminute Do you see it? everyminute
Do you see it? Do you see it?

Let's go Slow Mo' Let's go Slow Mo'
It's what you make it It's how you see it
It's how you take it It's your own design
