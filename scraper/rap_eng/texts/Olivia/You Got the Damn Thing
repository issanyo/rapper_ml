Underdogs

You know you got the damn thing

[Verse 1:]
You got the damn thing I like (oh yeah)
You know you got the damn thing I like (I like, I like)
(You got the damn thing)
You know you got the damn thing I like
You know you got the damn thing

Papi, fly as can be
Looking flossy now, daddy
I see you thugin' with your peeps
That's so sexy to me

You're a dime piece like me
Like what I see
I'm gonna get it
We can take it to my drop top
Tell your boys that you just hooked up

[Chorus:]
Little chick
Little ride
Got a little bit of thug in me
You know it's goin down
If I let you mash wit me

Baby can't you see
Can't you see that I'm feeling you
Everything about you is so tight
You know you got the damn thing I like

Gotta a G straight trippin'
Up in the club with your wrist iced up
And your temps like what all right
Sometime you know
You got the damn thing I like

The kind that makes me sippy
Then straight up wit your wrist laced up
I'm feeling you
Cuz you got the damn thing I like

[Verse 2:]
All these guys getting at me
But you don't speak
What you don't see me
Boy, you know you do
But you got this attitude

Actin all hard in your ?
Turnin' me on
You know I'm waiting
Baby, why don't we shake up spot
And tell your boys
That you just hooked up

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Usually playas
Can't fade me
Can't make me
Or break me

But everything about you
Has got me twisted
I'm tweaking for them
From your luv mentality, yeah
I'm feelin' ya (feelin' ya, feelin' ya)

[Repeat Chorus:]
