Sell your soul for cash
Sell your soul for life
Everybody needs to make money
Everybody needs to feed their children
But even though we have enough
We continue for more
Everybody wants to be rich
Everybody wants to rich
Everybody

We're fucking animals
We're fucking animals
We're fucking, fucking
Fucking animals
We're fucking animals
We're fucking animals
We're fucking, fucking
Sugarbloodsuckers

Look at what we do to each other for ourselves
Look closely
You think you're innocent?
Look closely

We've created a world
It's our world
Confusion
This can't be real
This can't be real
