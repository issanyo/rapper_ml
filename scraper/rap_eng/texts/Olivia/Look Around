[Verse1: Olivia]
I feel so lost
This emptiness deep inside me
U might as well just stay with her
Did you lay with her?
'Cause whereever you were
You sure ain't thinking 'bout me
I've been spining around
Thinking about our love
And so far you helped me babe oooh
You've been messin' around
And lettin' me down
Simple lies and alibies
If you walk out the door you should..

[Hook1: Olivia]
Just look around
And see that she ain't me
And she'll never be

[Hook2: Jimmy Cozier]
Take a look around
And know that you're lettin' go
The best love you'll ever know

[Verse2: Jimmy Cozier]
It's just those simple things
Like Jealosy, houndin' me
Accusing me of things
I never did yea
And Thursday you're so in love
Then Friday comes you flip again
Tell me does the drama ever end?
I've been spinnin' around
Thinking about our love
And so far it's crazy
And you keep on talking about
I'm messing around
I cheated you, mistreated you
There's nothing in the world for you I won't do

[Hook2: Jimmy Cozier]
Take a look around
And know that you're lettin' go
The best love you'll ever know

[Hook1: Olivia]
Just look around
And see that she ain't me
And she'll never be

[Verse3: Olivia and Jimmy Cozier]
Look around
Look around and realize
That being good to you
You can't believe every little thing
That your friends be tellin' you
Your friends be tellin' you
Looked around and what I find
You ain't here with me see
You lied before and you lied some more
It's clear to see
Just look around yea

[Hook1: Olivia]
Just look around
And see that she ain't me
And she'll never be

[Hook2: Jimmy Cozier]
Take a look around
And know that you're lettin' go
The best love you'll ever know
