Say something bad
Yeah you hurt me bad
And you don't even, even realize it
I hope you know that you're looking bad
And you don't even, even realize it

What's going on in that head of yours
I'm trying to enjoy my coffee

Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
I'm getting sick of your shit today
Sugar sugar
Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
P.A.S.S. me the sugar

You're so lovely
Yeah did you know that?
I know you better than you realize it

Let's find that map
Let's go search for that hidden treasure
I think you're missing out
Let's go explore

Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
Everyone's gonna wanna run from you
Sugar sugar
Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
P.A.S.S. me the sugar

What's going on in that head of yours
I'm trying to enjoy my coffee

Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
I'm getting sick of your shit today
Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
P.A.S.S. me the sugar

While you're at it
Please give me a donut too
Sugar sugar
Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
Pass me the sugar
P.A.S.S. me the sugar
