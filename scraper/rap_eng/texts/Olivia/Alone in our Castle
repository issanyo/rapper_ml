So the siren went off
It chased you out of your mind
Just when I started to grow a garden
How selfish of me
But I need something to build onto
You can't leave me here

Alone in our castle
Alone in everything we have
I'll never see your face
The way it is in our castle

So I kidnapped your sweet sparrow
So I am dancing around on your pain
The hallways echo your longing
We both know what needs to be done
But something's holding on

Alone in our castle
Alone in everything we have
I'll never feel your skin
The way I do in our castle

Love, oh love
I want to believe in love
I want to believe this feeling
That I feel deeply for you
But if you can't, turn away and go
Don't turn back, and I'll do the same

Alone in our castle
Alone in everything we have
I'll never see your face
The way it is in our castle

Alone in our castle
Alone in everything we have
I'll never feel your skin
The way I do in our castle
