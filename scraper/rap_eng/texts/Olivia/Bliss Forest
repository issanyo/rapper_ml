Crashing Contour
China Luna
Synchro Halo
Makes me tingle

I know that I was dragging you
Through unknown places
But you have to trust me my love
Cause in my heart there's only you

Now I know the rain is gone
To a far off land
Now I want to bring you here
Towards the wishing well
You gotta make a wish now

I'm no warrior
Bless you candy
