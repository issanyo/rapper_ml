[Verse 1:]
It's a natural feeling
And it always comes easy
Like a gentle summer breeze
Blowing softly through my mind

When I feel the sensation
It's not a one night temptation
With an imprint of your love
That will linger for all times

[Hook:]
Now you're touching secret places
No one's touched before
And I wanna feel you deep inside
Forever mi amor

[Chorus:]
Baby when 2 souls touch (when our souls touch)
There's no way that
You can escape from the rush (the rush)

I'm under your power
Just like a flower (I'm ready, baby)
Whose ready to open up
When 2 souls touch

[Verse 2:]
For your love that I'm living
All the joy that your giving
The new light in my life
Prayed for you so many nights

There's no words to express it
So I'd rather undress it
Like the shadows on the wall
Speak the eliquence of love

[Repeat bridge:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Hook:]
Loving you constantly
Seems to be all I need
My only thought
My one desire

When your love's deep inside
Feels so good I could cry
Tears of joy
Like raindrops from the sky
From my eyes

[Repeat Chorus:]
