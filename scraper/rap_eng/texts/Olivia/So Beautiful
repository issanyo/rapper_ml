Suddenly I decided to get up and run
I started to run and run and run
I jumped over little ant-holes
I jumped over flowers, I jumped over trees
Jumped over color, Jumped over people smiling at me

I jumped over March, April, May
I jumped over Autumn I ran past the warmth
I ran through his arms
I ran past a girl waving her hand at me
I ran and ran passing everything in front of me
I jumped over ability I jumped over my own heart
Jumped Mexico, jumped the clouds
Jumped the moon, jumped the stars
Jumped mars, jumped the truth

Yami ga terashita kawaita michi ni tachidomaru
Tsukarehateta kono karada ni nani ga aru no?

So Beautiful So Beautiful So Beautiful
Aoida sono kanata ni It's so Beautiful
So Beautiful So Beautiful So Beautiful
Tsunaida hikari hanatareru How Beautiful

Darker & Darker & Darker
The cold wind was sneeking inside of me
I didn't know if I was running away from me
I couldn't see anything I couldn't feel anything. no ~
My hands were pulling on my legs
The sticky mud was sucking them down
I couldn't stop, I had to have the Queen Crown

Kaze ga hibi ita furueru mune ni toikakeru
Iki wo kirashi mezasu basho ni nani ga aru no?

So Beautiful So Beautiful So Beautiful
