[Verse 1: Rap]
Get your cock stiff then change the topic
Mansion in the tropics, hot shit
Laser cut key by the locksmith
Tight security, C 4 just to pop shit
Nigga know we stop shit
Only see the bra, see more when you cop it
Dolce Gabbana, size four when I rock it
I got all your cash, what more can I pocket
Holdin' down the fort, no other bitch can top this

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you flip it? Can you hit it?
Are you ready to get with it tonight?
Can you give me what I want? Can you do the things I want?
Can you kiss below the border while I run the camcorder tonight?
Can you give me what I want?
Are your skilled or can you do me right?

[Chorus]
Are you capable? (Are you capable?)
Do you think that you can handle the floor?
For sure (for sure, for sure)
Are you capable? (Are you capable?)
Can you spank it 'til I'm beggin' for more?
For sure
Are you capable?

[Verse 2: Rap]
Who be the caramel mami?
Niggas wanna with me like I was the Kawasaki
Open up the Pocahontas face, the Gabanna lace
Shit I hate your man up and never leave a trace
Yo why you fell in love with a dime like O'Lovely
Sippin' bubbly, niggas wanna rub me
In the tub, see, cuz I'm nasty
Blow  your back be in the backseat
In my rimmed up Navi

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you flip it? Can you hit it? Are you ready to get with it tonight?
Can you give me what I want? Can you do the things I want?
Can you kiss below the border while I run a camcorder tonight?
Can you give me what I want? Are your skills ??, can you do me right?

[Chorus]
Are you capable? (Are you capable?)
Do you think that you can handle the floor? (Can you handle the floor?)
For sure (Can you handle the floor?)
Are you capable? (Are you capable?)
Can you spank it 'til I'm beggin' for more?
For sure
Are you capable?

[Bridge:]
Do you got the stamina?
Are you just an amateur?
Are you capable? (We can pull an all-nighter)
Can you ??
Do you got the anedote?
Are you capable? (Are you capable? Are you capable?)
Can you give me what I need baby?

[Chorus]
Are you capable? (Are you capable?)
Do you think that you can handle the floor? (Can you handle the floor?)
For sure (Can you handle the floor?)
Are you capable? (I gotta know)
Can you spank it 'til I'm beggin' for more?
For sure
Are you capable?

[Outro]
Can you make it right?
Do you think that you can handle the floor?
For sure
Are you capable...
