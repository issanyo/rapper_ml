[Verse 1:]
Tonight
I'm feeling freaky
I wantcha near me

Inhibition in the wind
Erotic thoughts arouse me
It's so enticing
I can't wait for us to begin

[Chorus:]
Wear something sexy for you
I'm feeling hot
And tempting for you to see me
Wrap your hand up 'round my body
Welcome to my private party

Home before you
This evening is special
Believe me
Belly dancing
So watch me
Welcome to my private party

[Verse 2:]
I know just how you like
I will provide it
At this party anything goes

Let your thoughts explore
The deepest fantasies
You're feeling
I got alot of things to show

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Speaking in Spanish:]

It's exclusive
Just me and my baby
It's getting so crazy
My private party

[Repeat Chorus:]
