[Verse 1:]
Get your cock stiff
And change the topic
Mansion in the tropics
Hot shit
Laser cut key by the locksmith
Tight security, C-4 just to pop shit
Nigga know we stop shit
Only see the bras, see more when you cop it
Dolce Gabbana, size four when I rock it
I got all your cash what more can I pocket
Holding down the fort
No other bitch can top this

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you flip it? Can you hit it?
Are you ready to get with it tonight?
Can you give me what I want?
Can you do the things he won't?
Can you kiss below the border
While I run a camcorder tonight?
Can you give me what I want?
Are your skills up?
Can you do me right?

[Chorus]
Are you capable?(Are you capable?)
Do you think that you can handle the floor?
For sure (For sure, for sure)
Are you capable? (Are you capable?)
Can you spank it 'til I'm beggin' for more?
For sure, are you capable?

[Verse 2:]
Who be the caramel mami
Niggas wanna with me
Like I was the Kawasaki
Open up the Pocahontas face
The Gabanna lace
Shit, I hit your man up
And never leave a trace
Yo, why you fell in love
With a dime like O'Lovely
Sippin' bubbly
Niggas wanna rub me
In the tub see, cos I'm nasty
Blow your back B in the backseat
Of my rimmed up Navi

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you flip it? Can you hit it?
Are you ready to get with it tonight?
Can you give me what I want?
Can you do the things he won't?
Can you kiss below the border
While I run a camcorder tonight?
Can you give me what I want?
Are your skills up?
Can you do me right?

[Chorus]
Are you capable? (Are you capable?)
Do you think that you can handle the floor?
For sure (For sure, for sure)
Are you capable? (Are you capable?)
Can you spank it 'til I'm beggin' for more?
For sure. Are you capable?

[Bridge:]
Do you got the stamina?
Are you just an amateur?
Are you capable?
(Can you pull an all-nighter)
(Make me feel all-righter)
Can you rock these inner walls?
(I need a probe, baby)
Do you got the antidote?
Are you capable?
(Are you capable? Are you capable?)
Can you give me what I need baby?

[Chorus]
Are you capable? (Are you capable?)
(Can you handle this?)
Do you think that you can handle the floor?
(I don't think so)
Can you handle the floor?
(Gotta let me know)
For sure (Can you handle the floor)
Are you capable? (I gotta know baby)
Can you spank it
'Til I'm beggin' for more?
(Can you keep me can you keep me satisfied?)
For sure (for sheezzy)
Are you capable?
(Can you make it right?)
Do you think that you can handle the floor?
(Let me know what you would do)
For sure...
