Hodoketa yume ni arashi ga furu
Namae wo yobu koe sagasu

Mou aenakute
You're fading bit by bit
Please don't go faraway
Hakanai kisetsu ni
Torinokosarete yuku

I miss you, I miss you
You reflect the stronger me
You bring out the best in me
I miss you, I miss you
You know what I'm trying to say
No need for words
Kobore sasu hikari ga yurameku asa ni hitorikiri
You're not here

Anata ga kureta sabishisa sae
Kogoeru hodo mada koishii

Tada aitakute
I feel your existence
Maybe you can feel me, too
Ano hi kanadeta
Ai no kotoba wo omou

I miss you, I miss you
You are so magical
You turn my tears to rainbows
I miss you, I miss you
You comfort me
With your ease and openness
Kobore ochita ai ga kirameku yakitsuku hodo tsuyoku
You're in my heart

I miss you
You turn my rainbows to tears

I miss you, I miss you
You reflect the stronger me
You bring out the best in me
I miss you, I miss you
You know what I'm trying to say
No need for words
Kobore sasu hikari ga yurameku asa ni hitorikiri
You're not here
