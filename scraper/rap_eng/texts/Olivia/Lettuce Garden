You're a lolipop that I suck on
You melt in my mouth
I just swallow you down
They can't see me
Because you're in my face
Only I can see you

Tell me you know what you're doing sir
At least tell me you were thinking sir
I know you weren't thinking of yourself sir
Right sir?

Silent war, silent war, silent war
I'd rather die than to lick your blood
I'm not living in, no I'm not living in
Silent war, silent war, silent war
Silently moving with silent weapons
I'm not living in, no I'm not living in
I'm not living in your
Lettuce garden

I'm a lolipop that you suck on
I melt in your mouth
You just swallow me down
You can't see me
Because I'm in your veins
You can feel me

I know what I'm doing sir
I know what I'm thinking sir
So don't tell me how to live my life sir
Right sir?

Silent war, silent war, silent war
Love never fades away here
We've got an army of angels
Silent war, silent war, silent war
Silently bleeding, silently dreaming
I'm not living in, no I'm not living in
I'm not living in your
Lettuce garden

Silently, silently, silently
