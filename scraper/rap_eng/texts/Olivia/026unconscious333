You don't fall on your face now
I'm gonna get out of routine
Say, I'm not gonna be on a leash
Everybody say, say
I wanna be
You don't fall on your face
I'm gonna get out of routine
Say, I'm not gonna be on a leash
Not gonna be on a leash

Spend our days in a dream
Getting along together
We won't need rules
Our mind will take us
Where we want to go

Find a new way to survive
Create a passage
For a world illuminant
Transforming our history
