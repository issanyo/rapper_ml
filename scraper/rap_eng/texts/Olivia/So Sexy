[Intro:]
Ohh...
Ah, ha
Yeah...
Ah, ha...
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Sometime
Outside
Making love
While the rain is falling

Touch me
Gently
You know me
Don’t care who’s watching

Loathing
All night
Close your eyes & find my body
Whisper to me that you want it

[Bridge:]
Baby, baby
Heart be pounding when you near me
Feel so weak
I need you with me
When I think of sexy
I think of you

[Chorus]
Wanna know
Can you keep it up
Cause tonight I’m feeling oh so sexy
In the mood for makin’ love
Wide open
Look at how you got me

Can’t wait ‘til I get home
Need to feel your
Body wrapped around me

Gotta know can you keep it up
'Cause tonight
I’m feelin’ oh so sexy

[Verse 2]
Let go love
Want it
So don’t try to bite it

Just you
It’s just us
That’s the way
I know you like it

Slowly
So deep
Boy
Look what you up & started
Don’t you even think of stopping

[Repeat Bridge]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge 2]
Just as soon
As we hit the door
Our clothes are off & on the floor
I can’t help in
In the way I do about you

My neck, my back
I’m sick & red
Don’t think
Boy make you deal with it
Can’t help it
I get off on you

[Repeat Chorus x3]
