Im in love with Americas most wanted dangerous thug
Wanna call him but my phones bugged
And im wondering how long he'll be gone
Really want to see your face
So meet me at a secret place
I got a judge to fix this case
Don't worry you'll be home in a hurry

Yo, my man left town on some serious business
(what has he done, what has he done)
D.A. even said they got a witness
(now he's on the run, I don't even know)
Its hurting me so bad I don't think I can deal with it
(should have used my gun, naw I ain't goin' out like that)
Now i gotta be strong cause when hes out we still gon' be together
(cause hes the only one, yeah thats my shawty aiight)

Now that hes gone and im all alone, now I pull my own
Gotta hold it down 'till he comes home
Now that hes gone and im all alone, now I pull my own
Gotta hold it down 'till he comes home

Im'a be here boo
So do what cha doin'
I'll send you some cash through western union
Police been askin', so boo stay true and
I ain't tell them nothing, about what you movin'
They ran in the crib, guns drawn, mad Glocks
They ain't find no cash or a stash box
They found your number on the back of a match box
So they got your phone bugged up, talk about tough love

Yo, my man left town on some serious business
(what has he done, oh oh oh what has he done)
