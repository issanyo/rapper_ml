It had myself to be
It was all my doing..
Now I’m the one who’s moving
.. try to make up is not too late
My vision is much cleaner now!

Bridge:
I can’t keep lying to myself
Saying there’s nobody else
When I know just what you’re doing
Who the hell are you fooling?
But why another day
Wish I could go to the place
Before you and me, cause you were worthy

Chorus:
I’m taking my heart and walk out the door
This time I want come back
Cause you’re the best thing that I wish never happen to me
I do much better, better than what I did before
Cause you’re the best thing that I wish never happen to me

I should have seen the sun
I was blinded by the bright light
But never…
But you was… my eyes
Taking…
While another is in your arms
I see much clear now

Bridge:
I can’t keep lying to myself
Saying there’s nobody else
When I know just what you’re doing
Who the hell are you fooling?
But why another day
Wish I could go to the place
Before you and me, cause you were worthy

Chorus:
I’m taking my heart and walk out the door
This time I want come back
Cause you’re the best thing that I wish never happen to me
I do much better, better than what I did before
Cause you’re the best thing that I wish never happen to me

I wanna thank you for the lies
I wanna thank you for the hurt you gave
I took a shot at the game
And I lost it all!
So the only thing left to do
Is get back all the love I gave to you!

Chorus:
I’m taking my heart and walk out the door
This time I want come back
Cause you’re the best thing that I wish never happen to me
I do much better, better than what I did before
Cause you’re the best thing that I wish never happen to me
