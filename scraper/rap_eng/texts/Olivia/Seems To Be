Remember I was sixteen with a mind of my own
You were Seventeen
And you thought you was grown
I found a thrill when we went up a hill
And you ues to feel me
My body would get chills

I picked you up in my 89 Chevy
I brought you candy and popcorn
At the movies
I had it made when I, got paid
And we, go roller skate
But every thing has changed, Wait

Seems to be to me
Something wrong with this household
Seems to be to me
You're always trying to take control
Seems to be to me
Something wrong with the kissing
Seems to be to me
Something is missing

Seems to be to me
Something wrong with the making love
Seems to be to me
You forgot what love was
Seemsto be to me
Something wrong kissing
Seems to be to me
Something is missing

We had fun that year that you turned 21
You were my world
Cause you brought me my baby girl
She so fine and she's all mine
AndI promised to love you
Until the end of time

(Olivia)
That's ok cause I felt the same way
But you're running game
And that's when everything changed
The phone calls and your two ways
And your attitude
You wated too many pimp tapes

After all of the things
That we been througth
I'm still willing to take care of you
Girl we been together for so long
And I just want to know, What's going on?

Seems to be to me
Something wrong with this household
Seems to be to me
You're always trying to take contrl
Seems to be to me
Something wrong with the kissing
Seems to be to me
You forgot what love was
Seems to be to me
Something wroong with the kissing
Seems to be tome
Something is missing

What happen to kissing and hugging?
Insteadof all that cussing and fussing
I wanna know right now
What you got to say

What happen to respecting me?
Instead of spending time in the street
I don't need to know; in fact I got to go

Wait baby let me plead my case
I got a faw more things to say
Shit is making me mad
Girl what I do so bad?

What about that girl
You sending money to down the way?
What about, you been cheating on me
She had your baby?
What about, the lies and deceit
I face day to day?
What about, I don't feel the way I used to
I lost my faith in you?

Seems to be to me
Something wrong with this household
Seems to be to me
You're always trying to take control
Seems to be to me
Something wrong with kissing
Seems to be to me
Something missing

Seems to be to me
Something wrong with the making love
Seems to be to me
You forgot what love was
Seems to be to me
Something wrong with the kissing
Seems to be to me
Something is missing
