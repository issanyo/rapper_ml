Fuck conversation, I'ma throwin' him a lever
Leavin' the crib with a 'Dear John' letter
I'm takin' what I need, nigga fuck all ya cheddar
Fuck all ya jewelry and fuck all ya cars
You ballin' while I'm wishin' on stars
Won't have me wildin' while you puffin' on dro's
Have me in the crib, all panty and bras
While you in the Benzo messin' wit broads
Have ya'll face in another bitch twat
Go ahead playa boy, that's how you get shot
And I ain't even like that silly nigga
But I'm hurt and I'm filled up with liquor
Ponderin' on if you really feel her
Only a man could make a girl a killer
And wit a nine like this, my nigga, don't sleep
I'ma creep up on your behind, my nigga
I'm about to bizounce, I can't take this shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy 'cuz I can't trust you
I'm ridin' high now, so nigga fuck you
I'm about to bizounce, I can't take this shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy 'cuz I can't trust you
I'm ridin' high now, so nigga fuck you
Drivin' in yo Benzo, shinned up Lorenzo
Ashtray filled wit Indo, toss it out the window
Bein fast as the ash blow, leavin a nigga, fuck ya cash flow
I got my own account and it holds a nice amount
I'ma come back for my clothes and come back for my roles
You can keep them other hoes, nigga that's how the game goes
And if ya didn't know, better ask somebody, baby
Shoulda treated me like your lady, nigga, I gotta bizounce
I'm about to bizounce, I can't take this shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy 'cuz I can't trust you
I'm ridin' high now, so nigga fuck you
I'm about to bizounce, I can't take this shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy 'cuz I can't trust you
I'm ridin' high now, so nigga fuck you
Fuck the conversation, I'm throwin' you a letter
Keep them platinum credit cards, keep all of your cheddar
That shit don't mean nuttin' to me 'cuz I'm tired of you stressin' me
The scent of perfume on ya clothes, messin' wit them silly hoes
Got me feelin' miserable, peddlin' up wit Hen and Coke
Sleepin' wit the enemy, boy, you don't wanna fuck wit me
I'm about to bizounce, I can't take this shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy 'cuz I can't trust you
I'm ridin' high now, so nigga fuck you
I'm about to bizounce, I can't take this shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy 'cuz I can't trust you
I'm ridin' high now, so nigga fuck you
I ain't never comin' back no more, know you heard that shit before
I don't never wanna see your face, faded pictures on the make-up case
Shoulda known what ya missed at home
Now you roll along wit no one to bone
You ain't never gonna get no dough, not from me, no no
I'm about to bizounce, I can't take this shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy 'cuz I can't trust you
I'm ridin' high now, so nigga fuck you
I'm about to bizounce, I can't take this shit no more
Picture frame broken daddy 'cuz I can't trust you
