Turn it up!

[Intro: Sean Kingston]
I don't know were I'm gonna be tomorrow
Where ever you love me to follow
I love you till the end of time
And you'll always be mine.
I love you till the sun don't shine, shine
And everyday you'll be mine
[x2:] Sun don't shine, o-oh

[Verse 2:Olivia]
Ain't nothing better
Than seeing you when I wake up
You turn over kiss my face without make-up
You give me all I ever wanted
My heart is open you're my one and only.
I believe you love me, yeah
And you can't be yourself
With no one but me, yeah!

[Hook:]
[Olivia:]
If the world breaks down tomorrow
Till the end of the earth I'll follow
Cause I will never leave you, never my baby
[Sean Kingston:]
I don't know were I'm gonna be tomorrow
Where ever you love me to follow (you love me)
I love you till the end of time
And you'll always be mine
I love you till the sun don't shine, shine
And everyday you'll be mine
[x2:] Sun don't shine, o-oh

[Verse 2:Olivia]
Never and never
I ain't going no where
I ain't go no where
They can take away from me
Cause this is ain't like a song
That comes and goes,
Compare me with your heart
I'm forever yours.
What we've got
We've built
And baby it's forever strong
I promise then no one
Can break to say good bye.

[Hook: Olivia + Sean Kingston]

[Outro: Sean Kingston: x2]
I don't know were I'm gonna be tomorrow
Where ever you love me to follow (you love me)
I love you till the end of time
And you'll always be mine
I love you till the sun don't shine, shine
And everyday you'll be mine
[x2:] Sun don't shine, o-oh.
