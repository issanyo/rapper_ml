Why are you looking at me like that?
I do not feel a very good vibe
Why are you pushing me away?
Now It's not like I really want to stay

Oh I, I might be small
But it doesn't mean I can't reach the sky
I, I might be weak
But it doesn't mean you can knock me down

Don't Dress me Up
I'm already dressed
Do you like my shoes?
Why are you turning away?
You haven't seen nothing yet
Don't Dress me Up
I'm already dressed
Do you like my shoes?
Why are you turning away?
You haven't seen nothing yet

Why aren't you giving me a chance
I have a way of my own
Why are you being so damn crude
Hey look! You are a human being like me

Oh I, I might trip and fall
But it doesn't mean I don't know how to stand tall
I, Don't look like her
But I am glad as hell I am, who I am

Don't Dress me Up
I'm already dressed
Do you like my shoes?
Why are you turning away?
You haven't seen nothing yet
Don't Dress me Up
I'm already dressed
I've got something to say
You don't know what I can do
And you don't know who I am

Don't Tear me Up
Into many pieces
You can't touch my soul
You better get used to it
Cause, I'm not going no where
Don't Dress me Up
I'm already dressed
Do you like my shoes?
Why are you turning away?
You haven't seen nothing yet
