I've been waiting, anticipating
Don't make me wait, ummm, don't make me wait

Tick tock feelin' kinda' hot
No need to knock, knock I left the door unlocked
Follow the petals to the bubble bath
Pop the Alize and don't you keep me waiting

There's a tatoo on my back, use it like a map
It points the way down to my love
Once you view the cat, ain't no turnin' back
Its on its on till dawn
Baby start up at my earlobe, slide down to my collarbone
Go directly to my belly ring, a little lower to my heart
Take a trip up to my mountain, don't be scared to taste the sea
Take your tongue and blaze a trail down, a little lower to my heart

In, out that's the way we go
Scream shout make me lose control
We can take it low down on the floor
Till we both explode
Stay just where you are I wanna feel you in my heart

There's a tatoo on my back, use it like a map
It points the way down to my love
Once you view the cat, ain't no turnin' back
Its on its on till dawn
Baby start up at my earlobe, slide down to my collarbone
Go directly to my belly ring, a little lower to my heart
Take a trip up to my mountain, don't be scared to taste the sea
Take your tongue and blaze a trail down
( take your tongue and blaze a trail down)
A little lower to my heart

Take your time and do me right
Playa don't you rush, cause we've got all night
Show me that the man in you knows just do, dadadadaaaa
Brake it down brake it down
