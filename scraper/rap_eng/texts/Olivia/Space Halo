You tell me that you love me
I watch you look out the window
Into the luminous blue sky
With eyes of loneliness
As if you had to go...

What will it take to win your smile
Does it help for you to know
That nothing can break my love for you
Believe in me, if you need to believe

Look into my eyes
Deep into my eyes

I wish you would let go
Of your space halo
Come down here and live
With me, live with me

The fear begins to creep in
The distance begins to grow
I can't find the right words to say
I need to know it's okay, okay...

How am I supposed to hold you at ease
How am I supposed to know you love me
How am I supposed to hold you at ease
How am I supposed to know you love me
How am I supposed to hold you at ease
How am I supposed to know you love me

I wish I could make you truly happy
So you would never want to leave this world

I wish you would let go
Of your space halo
Come down here and live
With me, live with me
