I trap myself into a tiny purple box
I stick a straw through a hole
So I can breathe

I got no other place to go, you see
I got no other place to go
This is what I learned to do
This is my, this is my home to me

I decide to cut a bigger hole with a fork
So I can get a view of what's going on
I put my ear up against the box
And wait till it's silent
Then carefully push the hole out
And set foot on the ground

But then all these ants start to crawl up my legs
I roll into a hole
Where 18 red eyed rabbits with hatchets
Take me prison and force feed me carrots
Throw me out into a river

I got no other place to go, you see
I got no other place to go
This is what I learned to do
This is my, this is my home to me

I got no other place to go, you see
I got no other place to go
This is what I learned to do
This is my, this is my home to me
