I am tripping out on myself
I am tripping out on myself
I have to watch my thoughts
Before they come to life
Before they come to life

I have to get you out of my head
I have to swallow my tongue
I have to find where I went
Before she comes to life
Before she comes to life

They're coming to get me
She's coming right towards me
They're coming to take me away
She's getting closer

I can't hide my secrets
They're listening to me
They're always listening to me

They're coming to get me, coming to get me, coming to get me
She's coming to get me, coming to get me
They're coming, she's coming
They're coming, coming
She's coming, they're coming

(Thank you.)
