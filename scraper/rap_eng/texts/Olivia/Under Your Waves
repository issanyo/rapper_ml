Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more
Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more

Your drugs, my thrilling intake
I take whatever you make
Please make me feel our love

Touch me under your waves
Breathing under your waves

Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more
Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more

Soon you'll find me tipping on the edge
Sometimes I wonder how I'd feel
If you made me whole, made me safe

Touch me under your waves
Breathing under your waves

Touch me (you come closer to me)
Under your waves (when I push you away)
Breathing (you come closer to me)
Under your waves (when I push you away)

Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more
Lover, you make me wanna beg you for more
