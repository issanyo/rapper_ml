Xanadu
(Now we are here)
In Xanadu
Xanadu your neon light will shine
For you Xanadu
Yeh yeh
A place
Where nobody dared to go
The love that we came to know
They call it Xanadu
And now
Open your eyes and see
What we have made is real
We are in Xanadu
**A million lights are dancing
And there you are
A shooting star
An everlasting love
And you're here with me
Eternally
*Repeat
The love the dream the echoes of long ago
You needed the world to know
They are in Xanadu
The dream the love that came through a million years
That lives on through all the tears
It came to Xanadu
**Repeat
Xanadu
Xanadu
(Now we are here)
In Xanadu
Xanadu
Xanadu
(Now we are here)
In Xanadu
Now that I'm here
Now that you're near
In Xanadu
Now that I'm here
Now that you're near
In Xanadu
Xanadu
