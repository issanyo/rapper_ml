Someone's heart is breaking
I don't think it's funny
Power in hands of corruption
Stepping on our rights

What about the people
Who lost their loved ones?
Unnoticed unrightfulness
What makes you think
You're better than they are?
'Cause to me we're all the same

Will this fighting ever stop?
Twisted pattern from the past
Pass it down from the parents to the young
When is it gonna stop?
When is it gonna stop?
Who's gonna stop it, gonna stop it?

Let me love you
I don't wanna fight no more
Let me touch you
I don't wanna fight no more
Let me love you, love you, love you
I don't wanna fight no more

I think the greatest thing you can learn
Is to be kind
To every person in this world
To everything in this universe

Will this fighting ever stop?
One side give the other side momentum
To throw another hit
Back and forth, back and forth
Feed each others existance
It never stops, never stops
Who's gonna, who's gonna stop it?

Let me love you
I don't wanna fight no more
Let me touch you
I don't wanna fight no more
Let me love you, love you, love you
I don't wanna fight no more
