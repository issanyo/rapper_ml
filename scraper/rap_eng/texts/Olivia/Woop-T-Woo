[Verse1:]
I'm sick and tired of you coming home late
I look across the table, all I see is a cold plate
Uh You Don't know how it feels
Sleepin' under cold sheets
While your out runnin' the streets
I'm crying myself to sleep noo

[Chorus:]
I'm sick of your woop-t-woo
Ain't taking no shit from you
Is it me or your crew?
Let me know 'cause I'll go
[Repeat 2 times]

[Verse2:]
Now I don't wanna hear about
How you say shit is gonna change
See maybe for a day or two
Then it's back to the same old you
You'd rather be with Bob, Rob, and Dave
On th corner shooting dice game
See baby I gotta know
If that's the way it's gonna be
Then hell no

[Hook:]
I'm sick of your woop-t-woo
Ain't taking no shit from you
Is it me or your crew?
Let me know 'cause I'll go
[Repeat 2 times]

[Verse3:]
Everyday all I feel is pain
And when we make love it'll feel the same
You don't give a damn about the way I feel
(You don't give a damn, no you just don't give a damn)
So let me know the deal
'Cause boy I'm tired of missing you
(Boy I'm tired of missing you)
All my lonely days are through
(All my lonely days are through)
Baby when you think of me
(Baby when you think of me)
You'll see what you lost
(You'll see what you lost)
(No more crying)

I'm sick of your woop-t-woo
Ain't taking no shit from you
Is it me or your crew?
Let me know 'cause I'll go
[Repeat 6 times]

[Singing over hook]
I'm sick of your woop-t-woo
Ain't taking no shit from you
Let me go
I don't wanna be with you
Don't come back home
I change the locks
I put your stuff
Outside in a box
Your shirt
Your jeans
Your Tims
Damn I don't want you no more
Sick of your woop-t-woo
Sick of your shit
Is it me or your crew?
Oh uh Ooooh uh
Takin' no shit from you nooo
