Verse 1 Rap
F*** conversation, I'm throwin him a lever
Leavin the crib with a Dear John letter
I'm takin what I need, nigga f*** all ya cheddah
F*** all ya jewelry and f*** all ya cars
You ballin while I'm wishin on stars
Won't have me wildin while you puffin on dro's
Have me in the crib, all panties and bras
While you in the Benzo messin wit broads
Have ya'll face in another b***h twat
Go ahead playa boy that's how you get shot (I'ma get ya ass)
And I ain't even like that silly nigga
But I'm hurt and I'm filled up with liquor
Ponderin on if you really feel her
Only a man could make a girl a killer
And wit a nine like this my nigga don't sleep
I'ma creep up on your behind my nigga

Picture frame broken daddy
'cause I can't trust you
