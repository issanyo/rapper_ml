Don't call me babe
When you know my name
You're not the hunter
I'm not your game

This is it you gotta know when to quit
And you better get used to it
You address me with your eyes
Your not the winner
I'm not your prize

This is it don't you know when to split
And I'm getting kind of sick of your sh!*
Don't try to touch me
Don't try to ruin me
Then say that you want me

Hey, this is not ok
Hey hey, I said no way
You say I've got to chill well that's not cool
Just take it for your self, i'm no fool

Hey, this is not ok
Hey hey, I said no way
You say I've got to chill, well guess what
Just take it off yourself cause you're messed up
