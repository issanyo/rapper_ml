I just want to hear a voice
I'm peeking through little holes
Can anybody hear me?
Did I create this on my own?

Where do I go? What am I looking for?
Where do I go? What more can I do?

My Dear Angel I'm crying Please make me just a little more stronger
My Dear Angel Can't you see that I'm seriously trying?
My Dear Angel
Show me I can run Show me that I can fly
And show me I can walk through walls
Show me I can jump off any building and be fine

Every one is running away from me
Or am I running from them?
Why am I invisible to whats most important to me?

Another lesson For me to learn
Don't you think I've been a good girl?

My Dear Angel Please show me to be happy Please show me a better me
My Dear Angel I promise you I'll keep believing
My Dear Angel
Show me I can run Show me that I can fly
And show me I can walk through walls
Show me I can play the grand piano with no hands

My Dear Angel I'm crying Please make me just a little more stronger
My Dear Angel Can't you see that I'm seriously trying?
My Dear Angel Outside I'm fine Deep down inside I really can't take it
My Dear Angel I'm hurtin' Hold my heart in your hands
My Dear Angel
I'm not gonna lose No I'm not gonna hide
I'm gonna get my ass right up and I'm gonna
Show you everything I can do
