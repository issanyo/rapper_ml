Verse 1:
See i remember the very first time you came over to the house
He told me that he was falling in love and he sat down on the couch
He grabbed my hands and then pulled me closer and kissed me like a kid
I never expected that we'd be touchin, playing a game like this

Bridge:
It's gettin kinda warm up in here, warm up in here
I think i need to turn up the air
Cause when we make love it's some damn amazing
You about to sweat up my hair
This is what i said

Hook:
Take a pause
For a second
& breathe a minute
& let met test it
& turn it on
& turn it off
& turn it up
& take it off

Chorus:
He said, take take take it off
He said, take take take it off
Take take take it off
He said, take take take it off
I'm like baby i need one moment to breathe
A little more time to please
He said, take take take it off
He said, take take take it off
Take take take it off
He said, take take take it off

Verse 2:
It's going down
Like four flat tires
Boy you got my body on fire
Something like a lighter
Now beat it up like a fighter
Twelve rounds baby, we can pullin all nighter
Now let the beat knock boom boom boom
While the bed rock boom boom boom
Let's do it slow motion baby it gets rough in the ocean
Tell me if it's deep enough ..

Bridge:
It's gettin kinda warm up in here, warm up in here
I think i need to turn up the air
Cause when we make love it's some damn amazing
You about to sweat up my hair

Hook:
Take a pause
For a second
& breathe a minute
& let met test it
& turn it on
& turn it off
& turn it up
& take it off

Chorus:
He said, take take take it off
He said, take take take it off
Take take take it off
He said, take take take it off
I'm like baby i need one moment to breathe
A little more time to please
He said, take take take it off
He said, take take take it off
Take take take it off
He said, take take take it off
