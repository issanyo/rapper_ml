[Verse 1: Olivia]
This feeling I hang to
Is perfectly placed upon your wrist
And I have to say
What do they know anyway
The things that they call you
Are written in black ink on my skin
As long as you stand next to me
I won't let them it
I'm so disted
And she's so twisted
While we're both with it
They [?] you so indifferent
So we'll leave them in the shadows
Chasing feelings are too shallow
And won't stop for a second trip
And fall into the sunset

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2: Olivia]
She knows what it means
To be alone and watch your [?] split
And it seems such a helpless way to be
I know what she sees
When we're sitting together
Hands [?]
As we breathe
Hers in sync with me

[Instrumental]
