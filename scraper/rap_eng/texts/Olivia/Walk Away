You and I were suppose to go our separate ways
No matter how much I fight it, but still I stay
I can't believe my conscious got the best of me
It's telling me to let it go but I can't walk away
Ya sister called me bout a couple times today
She knew I had to get something off my mind right away
I gotta get a grip, I think I'm losing it
I don't know why I'm so confused, Ooo Yeah

[Hook:]
I'm not tryna leave you, believe me
Cause what I'm going thru it, ain't easy, nooo
Should I stay or should I go
But no matter how hard I try, I can't walk away
I'm not tryna leave you, believe me
Cause what I'm going thru it, ain't easy, nooo
Should I stay or should I go
But no matter how hard I try, I can't walk away

It's killing me, killing me to keep going on this way
I know I love but I don't know if I'm in love with you
It breaks my heart to say
We got too much work to do
So I don't know why I hold on to you
It gotta be some kinda that we can work this
Or I just gotta get over you Babyy

[Hook:]
I'm not tryna leave you, believe me
Cause what I'm going thru it, ain't easy, nooo
Should I stay or should I go
But no matter how hard I try, I can't walk away
I'm not tryna leave you, believe me
Cause what I'm going thru it, ain't easy, nooo
Should I stay or should I go
But no matter how hard I try, I can't walk away

See the moral of the story is that
Everybody had a love they ran back to
And I know that you be wishing that they came around
So that you can just go and do you
And I know that you'll be looking for a girl like me
I'll be looking for a guy like youu
But it seems that love... is just not enough

[Hook:]
I'm not tryna leave you, believe me
Cause what I'm going thru it, ain't easy, nooo
Should I stay or should I go
But no matter how hard I try, I can't walk away
I'm not tryna leave you, believe me
Cause what I'm going thru it, ain't easy, nooo
Should I stay or should I go
But no matter how hard I try, I can't walk away

I'm not tryna leave you, believe me
Cause what I'm going thru it, ain't easy, nooo
Should I stay or should I go
But no matter how hard I try, I can't walk away
