She's got it all but she ain't got you
Cause you're still talking to me
And if you say that it's perfect, baby
Why do you want to leave?

Why are you talking 'bout the old days?
Isn't your new girl enough?
I know you're saying that you want her, baby
But you can't want her that much

Now you're taking back everything you said
And you're crawling back inside my head
And you're pulling my strings like a marionette
But she's still in your bed

Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh you down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Hope I'm heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh you down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Hope I'm heavy on you
Heavy on you

You still leave comments on my pictures
You just can't leave me alone
Sometimes I wonder how it feels for her
Seeing me on your phone

Now you've got your dates and your trips overseas
But you keep on coming back to me
And you say she's the only girl you need
Well I guess we'll wait and see

Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh you down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Hope I'm heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh you down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Hope I'm heavy on you
Heavy on you

Everyone believes you
When you say that she's the one
But I know you're lying
Cause you're still calling me up

Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh you down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Hope I'm heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh heavy on you
Heavy on you
Hope I weigh you down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Hope I'm heavy on you
Heavy on you
