[Hook - Scotty]
She a Boss chick, she got it all
And she hold it down for me no matter the cost
Show me the way when I'm lost
She don't play no games, don't fuck with no lames
That's why I fuck with her the long way
Fuck with her the long way
Fuck with her the long way
Fuck with her the long way, Ohh
Fuck with her the long way


[Verse 1 - Belo]
Look, ma, I rock with you, I ain't on that bull...
Inhale this good ass love
Why not gon' head take a pull
Couple years ago, I was in a cell
Reading on some shit you wrote
You said you'd be down forever, whenever
And this is the shit I quote
Now I feel like I'm in debt, carry you and I bet
Once we have sex, all that you'll forget
I'ma blow your back on out
And we can make a movie, like two porno stars
Put you in a B thang, see thangs, peep game
Don't spill shit in my car
Now I lean wit ya, and I rock wit ya
Got the bird up in my car, don't let the cops get ya
Girl, you been down so long
Where the motherfuckin' good finger at?
I'ma put a ring on it, not sing on it
Beyonce can have that

[Verse 2 - AK]
Bentley Mulsanne
Bending through the hood and I gotta pick her up
Is she over there bout this plane
I ain't trippin' baby girl, wanna fuck with a star
Then I bend her up on the door step
Body better than a muhfucka, low key
I remember when we rolled on fleets
Never had no sleep
She get the money while I count those keys
We comin' up from the dirt now
Slumped down in the Maybach curtain
Perfect, got Gs in her purses
Her complexion chocolate, Hershey's
Picture us with the tent up, bent up
Straight through the hood
Got the diamond on the wood all squazy
Smokin' weed so my eyes all lazy
See how the cops be lookin' all crazy
She my one double zero, one hunnid
Got my name tattooed on her stomach
And she always say my name when she cumin'
We be fuckin' on our money, stuntin'
See, we can drop the top in these cold days
Cause a nigga got a crib up in H-Town
When she see the penthouse, she gon' stay
Cause she fuck with a nigga, the long way

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Twista]
She go crazy for me and she was there by my side
When I ain't have nobody help (nope)
She was lookin' out for me, when I was fucked up
And I didn't have nobody else
Took me everywhere I needed to go
And then when I needed to eat
She would give me a hot meal
Holdin' me down and I love her for it
Gotta tell her how I feel
Whenever we goin' through a problem
She handle it with the highest of intellect (think)
A freak when she get that Ros√© in her system
And I am so into that
Givenchy, Versace, Roberto Cavalli
You gotta give her that
Triss or Gohane, Alexander Wang
She gon' remember that
Who was there for you when you got into an accident
Or was hurt, not them!
Lookin' out for you when you was in federal custody
Or the penitentiary, in the dirt, Not them!
Only one that came to see me
Even if you know you had a long day, easy
Lovin' how you doin' it your own way, freely
That's why I'm fuckin' with you the long way [?]
