Stop that train I want to get on
My baby she's leaving me now
Did you hear that
Express yourself brother
Stop that train I want to get on
My baby she's leaving me now
And she really first got the train towards another guy
And I really can't believe she's gone and was telling a lie
Good God
And I tell you that the girl has really left I to cry
When she went bye bye
Good gracious
Stop that train I want to get on
Draw your brakes brother I just can't take it
'Cause the girl has really gone
Stop that train I want to get on
And the girl is gone for true
Goodness gracious
Skylarker
Play your guitar brother
'Cause this is indeed a sad song
She said she was going on the morning train
And all now I don't see she personal to talk to her again
That means she have a guy forward away with her
And I just can't take it no more
Stop that train
See I express I-self
Draw your brakes brother
'Cause you really taking my girl away from me
Stop that train, I want to get on
I can't even hold on to the back of the train
