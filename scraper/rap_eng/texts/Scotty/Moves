Verse 1:
Yeah, my nigga just called me he said that we movin
I don't do dormant these niggas is stupid
I like the progress you stuck in the moment
Im thinkin ahead man, I got the blueprint
I been moving likeâ€­ a uhaul
You don't ever really do shit
You don't ever really prove shit
You don't ever really, uh
My niggas movin like
We got a victim we two a like
Its 2 AM whatchu do at night
My niggas working, we do it like
Aye
This shit easy you tryna catch up to a nigga
But you can't fuck with this nigga
You can't even stunt on this nigga
Ya shorty be touchin this nigga, you mad
Im doin spazz, niggas be bent
They wanna show love but be on the fence
Cause niggas be jealous its not even funny
Thy focus on niggas instead of they money
How does that sound? I can't relate
Niggas be salty, look at they face
Tryna book shows in your city
Im stuntin like diddy
Im chasin my M's while Im all in your state
Movin in silence, I dont be speakin no moves wit these niggas, they plottin
Thats common sense, takin in knowledge
Niggas be wildin for profit
Niggas be beggin for features
Complainin bout prices I thought you were cashin
You flexing them bands in your videos thought you a balla, you actin

Background:
[small voice]
Niggas always talkin like they poppin and shit
Like they really out here puttin in work
They ain't doing shit my nigga
All they do is worry about the next nigga and what they doin
Hook x2:
Me and my niggas be moving
You and yo niggas be be losin
I gotta get it my nigga, aye
Pull up your shorty be choosin
I ain't  waitin for no handout
Get in my way better stand down
Big moves Im the man now
Big moves I'm the man now

Verse 2:
I can't wait to say we did it my nigga
I can't wait to count the yiddish my nigga
I can't wait to tell my momma to quit
Fuck all that workin and trippin my nigga
Now is bout time that we live
Island to island is the only way to trip
Dont need no bill drama, need them dollar bills
I Need a crib way up in the hills
Till I get it, I be workin, movin
I dont needa prove it, niggas laughing watching
But I'm always crusin cause I know I do it
Niggas hatin but I hustle through it
Niggas talking but not doing shit, aye
They just watching on some movie shit, aye
They see me as an influence, aye
Try to copy what I'm doing, aye
I just be countin my blessings
I'm way too damn focused ain't losing my balance
Writing these verses day to day I needa pay
I can't be scared of no challenge nigga
Young rappin nigga, I need a check
Im spazzin nigga
Steady moving why you asking nigga
Don't talk about it just action nigga, aye
Me and my niggas be movin aye
Dont do no drama we focused, aye
Dont give a fuck what you doin, aye
Dont really know if you notice, aye
Hope you remember this nigga, aye
Casue imma fuck all this shit up, aye
Not here to make friends witchu niggas, aye
Just here for the commas and lunch

[Background]
You got this..
Just focus on what you doing and
Dont listen to what everybody else is saying
They dont know what the fuck they talking bout
Keep making these plays my nigga
Move
