Drive fast
Threw a brick on the gas
Never came back
You're a gunshot
Baby where's my head at
I'm the passenger all alone

Did you use up
All that I gave
Did I give enough
I don't understand how you gave it up
But you gave it up
You gave it up

You
You
You must want another girl at night
And she's got the fuck you like
You like
But the hardest part was telling you goodbye
Tonight I thought I'd fall apart
You'd like to watch me fall apart
But the hardest part was telling you goodbye

You know I will always wonder why
But it's time
It's time
Now I'm jumping out the passenger side
Let it crash
It's time

You
You
You must want another girl at night
And she's got the fuck you like
You like
But the hardest part was telling you goodbye
Tonight I thought I'd fall apart
You'd like to watch me fall apart
But the hardest part was telling you goodbye
