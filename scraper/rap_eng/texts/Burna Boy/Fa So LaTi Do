[Verse 1]
Girl am not forging games right now
Eh, oh hu hu, eh

Gat what you want baby
So dont let no more baby
If I get ten dollars baby

When e go take your thoughts baby
Cos I read your thoughts baby

[Bridge]
You’d be wishing that I ride on tho
So I can slap my (?) beside of you oh
You'd be wishing that I ride on tho
So I can slap my (?) beside of you oh

[Verse 2]
Ride around my black car, you come find me
Now seeing two b*****s right beside me
Now seeing twenty n****s right behind me
Its what the city low light gonna find it
The money gat me all I want
Every other day I want
Suit yourself and say no more
Mama open this, cos I bring, pleas dont stop it
Riding on babe
Tell you mind (?)
You forgive me, amen
Not even remeber (?)

[Hook/Chorus]
Won bere poku ni, melo lo ti do
So re'ni, fa so la ti do oh
