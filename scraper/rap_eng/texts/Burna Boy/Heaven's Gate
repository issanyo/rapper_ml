Anyway
I thought you was a G but you're any snake
I swear down you can’t come around my estate
And ah gwarn like say you bad and brave
Because where me come from man are moving bait
An they got the whole block ducking jakes
So if none of you man gimme space
I'll show you 'bout knocking on
Heaven's Gate (Heaven's Gates)

[Verse 1: Lily Allen & (Burna Boy)]
My love what’s it gonna be (Roadboy)
When they sound the alarm will you come find me?
Mr. Bad and Boujee will you come pick me up
