[Intro]
Explore my open sea
Let my emotions see
If i should stumble off my feet
I hope that no one sees
I know, no one can save us (no)
So i just put all my pain and my problems in this styrofoam cup
And drink it all away
So here we go
Feeling so good (so good)
(listen) Got me moving in slow motion
(listen) I'm trying to walk on top of the ocean
I numb the pain
Numb the pain
Numb the pain
As the sun shine on me (on me)

Oh Lord have his mercy
JAE5

[Hook]
My baby say she wonder why i'm not around more
And is she getting what she came for
Wonder why i'm laughing all out for
I'm high baby
That's the sound when i'm inside you
And now i got you singing high notes
My doctor got something for you
To get on my level
And make you calm down

[Chorus]
Calm down
You have fi calm down
My baby calm down
Calm down
Cause if i start now, i no go calm down
Mi nah calm down

[Verse 1]
Solid like my granny
Solid like my daddy
Life no easy for me
So don't worry about what i'm drinking
I'm popping molly's in public
Bet they wish they'd never given me money
Cause i won't believe anything you tell me
I don't listen to nobody, don't tell me

[Chorus]
Calm down
Me nah go calm down
It ain't no calm down
Them wan me calm down
Calm down
Them wan me calm down
Me nah go calm down
Me nah calm down
Calm down

[Verse 2]
Anytime you step inna di compound
Get dem look pon me and them get dumbfounded
All my bitches with the shits you know they all down
I gotta slow down, let them go round
Me am quick to let them know how it goes down
Even though you know its only right that i put some [?] and sprite in a cup and say ayayayayayni

[Chorus]
Calm down
Calm down
Calm down

[Interlude]
I know
They don't wan't no smoke (x3)
I said they don't (x2)
No smoke
I said they don't
Don't want no smoke
They don't
Don't wan't no smoke

[Hook]
My baby say she wonder why i'm not around more

My doctor got something for you
To get on my level
And make you calm down

[Chorus]
