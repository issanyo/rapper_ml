South side niggas be the craziest
You know my niggas (?)
Them niggas ain't built to last
All my bitches want sex and cash
(?) when I do my dance
Got the good dick that's built to last
Spin you round and spank your ass
Bend you over then ride your back

Your body, feeling your body
Your body, feeling your body
Your body, body to body
Your body, body to body

If you get to my hotel room but imma meet you at the lobby
And the only thing on my mind is feeling on your body
Like whoa x6
Yeah x5
Feeling like I forgot my name because you only call me daddy
And I really can't blame you, I put it down like nobody
Like whoa x6
Yeah x5
Girl you know, I got that fire
Oh naughty, let's get it started
What'd I tell you bout coming to my crib with them damn clothes on (don't do that shit)
Girl tell me what you got all them clothes on for
Don't you see I'm waiting on you at the door

And you know I read your mind
Soon as I get inside
You know you love the vibe
