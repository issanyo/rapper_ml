[Intro: Burna Boy]
Many different rules outside, you’re new outside (so watch how ya move outside)
Better not get confused outside, dem go lose outside (so watch how ya move outside)
You no gon know if you no go
Don’t try reap what you don’t sow
Anytime you dey for road better don’t slow wo wo wo

[Pre-Chorus: Mabel]
I can't remember how it happened
Tell me now
And if I feel it any deeper, I might drown
Now I know you can never tell what is going down
From the outside (from the outside)
Outside (from the outside)
Outside, I'm on the outside

[Chorus]
Any deeper (and I may be)
Any deeper (and and I)
Any deeper (and I may be)
Any deeper (so watch how ya move outside)
Any deeper (and I may be)
Any deeper (and and I)
Any deeper (and I may be)
Any deeper (so watch how ya move)

[Verse 1: Burna Boy]
Outside of the jungle
Look around and no see nobody to run to
Wetin my eyes see for jungle
Look around and no see nowhere to run go
My brothers plenty for the jungle
But dey no know me again for the jungle
My people plenty for the jungle
But its everybody for themselves inna the jungle
Dem mama no go dey there
That's the reason why me tell you say

[Pre-Chorus: Mabel]
I can't remember how it happened
Tell me now
And if I feel it any deeper, I might drown
Now I know you can never tell what is going down
From the outside (from the outside)
Outside (from the outside)
Outside, I'm on the outside

[Chorus]
Any deeper (and I may be)
Any deeper (and and I)
Any deeper
Many different rules outside, you’re new outside (so watch how ya move outside)
Better not get confused outside, dem go lose outside (so watch how ya move outside)
You no gon know if you no go
Don’t try reap what you don’t sow
Anytime you dey for road better don’t slow wo wo wo (so watch how ya move)

[Verse 2: Burna Boy]
No say me have nuff history outside
Show you just how it feels to be outside
Shit that make it hard to sleep at night
I take you to these memories of mine
Come dey feel like say nobody fit to help me
Like say I dey shout but nobody hear me
Until finally nothing come dey fear me anymore (ye)
If only father God can talk to me
And tell me what he has in store for me
Could he let me know?
Cause only God knows the pain I feel
All day me never eat no meal
Oh all them say the good die young
Now the dead's getting younger
Age ain't nothing but numbers
This life's a jungle sometimes
I really wonder how I keep from going under
So before me mother cry and her eyes start swell
Cause her son end up like Vybz Kartel
