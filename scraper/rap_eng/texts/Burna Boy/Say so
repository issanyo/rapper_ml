Thunder fire bout the country now
Everybody say dey want me now
Even your guards want to hunt me down
Cos I'm very very very big now
I'm in VIP
You're biting your tongue trying to sing like me but anybody that invite me I'm gonna be rocking anything I see
Cos this one no be party na rave
You have every right to misbehave
You fit behave the way you like to behave
If anybody ask you tell them say

We fit come together like Lego
Migrate to gyrate o
Make we do the new dance
Wey dey reign o
Na Burna boy wey say so
We fit come together like Lego

I don't send una message If you no believe me
You can ask Levine
Or you can ask Quido Bakas o
If you believe them
You can ask Ese Or you can ask Ogado
Or you can ask my brethren Dambo
And they will confirm this information about the trials and tribulations
Me are to go through daily
So in this party I'm going crazy
So everybody put your hands up
And if you dey sitting down stand up
Na Burna boy wey say so
We fit come together like Lego
