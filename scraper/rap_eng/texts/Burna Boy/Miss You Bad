[Verse: Burna Boy]
I ain’t saying I’m in love
But I am staying I suppose
‘Cause I don’t know how I’m getting home
Shit’s been so rough
Double days on the road
Couple days in the same clothes
Baby I’ve been so drunk
Thinking about touching your body
Girl I know that you love me so better dry your eyes
Memories can tell mi nuh lie
Girl how many times must I apologise
Ye ke o, ye ke o
Omomi ye ke o
Emi gan gan ni baba eh

[Pre-Chorus: Mr Eazi]
Sake of I cheat, wey you cheat
Wey I cheat, wey you cheat back
Baby make we cancel am
Sake of I cheat, wey you cheat
Wey I cheat, wey you cheat back
Baby make we cancel am I no fit lie
I did you wrong
That be why I dey sing this song
Loving you is all I want
I just want to let you know
Mehn I miss you bad
I miss you bad
I cannot lie (no no no no no no)
I miss you bad
I want you bad (o yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Mr Eazi]
Sake of I cheat, wey you cheat
Wey I cheat, wey you cheat back
Baby make we cancel am
Sake of I cheat, wey you cheat
Wey I cheat, wey you cheat back
Baby make we cancel am I no fit lie
