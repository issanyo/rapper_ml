[Chrous]
Lately I’ve been on my toes
Enemies been on a mission
Fuck em, I’ma do the most
See them multiplying

[Verse 1]
So tell me what am I to do
When everybody hate on you
So how am I supposed to feel
When niggas try to scheme on me
Niggas never been real to me
These niggas just make believe
Last night I had a dream
Somebody gave me a time machine
Flew through the times back and forth
Still ain’t change nothing at all
Not even all of my bad luck
Not even all the times I broke the law

[Chrous]
Lately I’ve been on my toes
Enemies been on a mission
Fuck em, I’ma do the most
See them multiplying

[Bridge]
Dem ah pree me
See say dem pree me
Dem ah pree me
See say dem pree me

[Verse 2]
I got a lot of enemies
Some of them used to be my friends
But now they switched sides on me
I wonder why they all pretend
Even though it ain’t clear to me
What’s the gain in the end
Only one things clear to me
Me really can’t trust no friend
So you haffi watch your friend
Some of dem no really wan you reach nowhere
It’s the only the thing I cannot comprehend
There’s a lot going on up in my head
But I wouldn’t change anything
Not even all of my bad luck
Not even all the times I broke the Law

[Chorus]
Lately I’ve been on my toes
Enemies been on a mission
Fuck em, I’ma do the most
See them multiplying

[Bridge]
Dem ah pree me
See say dem pree me
Dem ah pree me
See say dem pree me
