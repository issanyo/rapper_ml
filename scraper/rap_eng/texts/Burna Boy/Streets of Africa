[Intro]
How can I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
If you put speakers in my mind
I bet it would sound like (whoa whoa whoa!)

[Hook]
That's why I smoke smoke smoke
Shirt off like I ain't got no clothes
Cause where I'm from there ain't no snow
So I refrigerate my flow
That's how a nigga keep it cold
How can I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
Even if I don't have no money
My nigga Tundi buy the bar

[Verse 1]
Back home they call me Oluwa Burna
Cause I'm so awesome, you should know
Always be on my Speed Darlington
You know me, I'm no regular
Bangdadadang when I step in the room
The ground beneath you shaking up
Soon as your wifey seen me and my crew
She said you're breaking up
18 karats on my earlobes
Make it hard to put on earphones
Haters talking, I don't hear though
With the game, I'm like Carmello
Pull up on girls like hello, whoa whoa

[Hook]
I'm Fela Kuti with the hoes
Shirt off like I ain't got no clothes
Cause where I'm from there ain't no snow
So I refrigerate my flow
Shout Luciano, that's my bro
How can I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
If you put speakers in my mind
I bet it would sound like..
How can I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
How can I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
How can I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
Even if I don't have no money
My nigga Tundi buy the bar

[Verse 2]
Sitting here rolling up my Backwoods
Smiling with diamonds in my mouth
Why would you want to fuck my day up?
My niggas run up in your house
Fucking with me, that's a no-no
Couple hot ones you can hold though
I pull up like Marco Polo
Make all the gyal dem go loco
Somebody call the po-po, no!

[Hook]
I'm Fela Kuti with the hoes
Shirt off like I ain't got no clothes
Cause where I'm from there ain't no snow
So I refrigerate my flow
And I do this with my eyes closed
La-la, la-la, la la, la la la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la la, la la la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la la, la la la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la la, la la la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
(whoa whoa whoa!)
How could I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
How could I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
How could I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
How could I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
Back home they call me Oluwa Burna
Cause I'm so awesome, you should know
Back home they call me Oluwa Burna
Cause I'm so awesome, you should know
How could I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
How could I not be happy all day?
I'm from the streets from Africa
