They call me burna boy hear me now
Me still representing A to the R representing
Hear me now hear me now

Say boy I do what I do
And them you never call me back
Said the pussy never call me back
Feeling for what we do but when the carny drops
Sitting in them carny drops

Nobody never did it when I done
Listen to me no one told me something magical
Something is wrong and the fact is bring me down
I found a microphone and I went professional
This is my profession, oh
Rocking with the kids and I send em by the pound
I got to runaway when the cops come around
Enemy turf, you better turn around
