[Verse 1]
Have to understand what i'm trying to show ya
Take you OT where nobody knows ya
I don’t know what you’ve been told baby
Lately I've been on my own baby
I don’t even know where i'm taking ya
Probably on a boat in the middle of the ocean
Way too drunk, I'm way too fucked baby
Popped a molly in the club babe

[Chorus]
Ooh I met the devil out in California
I've been living on the edge
But I won't fall down
Got a couple hunnids for the spending

[Post Chorus]
You should learn to share baby (Oh no)
I'm crazy, I know
How I did it, I don’t know
Heart breaker, all yours
I know I, said i'd change my life
But that was last night
I'm so high
Can't open my eyes
Can't look in your eyes

[Verse 2]
You got the juice
I got the sauce
It's only right we hit it off
But you gotta make a decision
You got the hoes
I got my woes
I cannot lose
But tonight i'm too fucked up to make decisions
I got soo much bitches
It's like all my life i've been knowing somethings been missing
Devil on my shoulder
That's why i can't stay sober

[Chorus]
Ooh I met the devil out in California
I've been living on the edge
But I won't fall down
Got a couple hunnids for the spending

[Post Chorus]
You should learn to share baby (Oh no)
I'm crazy, I know
How I did it, I don’t know
Heart breaker, all yours
I know I, said i'd change my life
But that was last night
I'm so high
Can't open my eyes
Can't look in your eyes

[Outro]
Give it one more time
But i said that last time
I know i said that last time
But this is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time (Oh ya)
