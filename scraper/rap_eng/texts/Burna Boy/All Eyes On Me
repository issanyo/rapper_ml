[Intro: Burna Boi]
Up to de time dem fi no say
Burna man king de original Nigerian
Don Gorgon riding true man hustle without a curfew
Along side de one AKA come fi steal this show
Dis a robbery de whole a dem fi know
Sound it!

[Pre-Hook: Burna boy]
And it's four now
Time to get them goons & kick your door down
Niggas ain't running anymore now
Bang bang! Everybody kiss the floor now
It's a (robbery)
All eyes on me
I see nobody
Stick em up & freeze
While I steal the show

[Hook: Burna Boy]
It's a robbery (All eyes on me)
Robbery, robbery, robbery (all eyes on me)
Robbery, robbery, robbery (all eyes on me)
Robbery, robbery, robbery (all eyes on me)
Robbery, robbery, robbery (robbery)

[Verse 1: AKA]
I'm trying to get this rap money in a rush
Tell em back it up for me when you see me in the club
Competition dead & buried in the dust
I'm like the legendary Brenda Fassie, Zola Budd
Once you get it, you never get enough
And you gon' need better credit to get ahead of us
We the power circle, coming to you live from the 3rd world
Getting high off the purple (Ay)
Bitch I'm on the top of my game
Black car, rap star, look at my face
If you ain't fucking what you here for?
I got a 7:30 shuttle to the airport, therefore
Twerk contest to my new sets
Job, let's do it for the youth then
I'm at the table with the bosses
You need to table up the losses

[Pre-Hook: Burna boy]
And it's four now
Time to get them goons & kick your door down
Niggas ain't running anymore now
Bang bang! Everybody kiss the floor now
It's a (robbery)
All eyes on me
I see nobody
Stick em up & freeze
While I steal the show

[Hook: Burna Boy]
It's a robbery (All eyes on me)
Robbery, robbery, robbery (all eyes on me)
Robbery, robbery, robbery (all eyes on me)
Robbery, robbery, robbery (all eyes on me)
Robbery, robbery, robbery (robbery)


[Verse 2: J.R.]
This a slowdown what's the hurry boy
Chilling at The Grand attacking, tswaking these mommy's boys
Pumping L.E.S for chubby mommies who got it going on
Moferefere re fesha gosina wrong ai
'Ska fafatlha ra ikutswa
And hawe fasa ra itsuba
Ha o ka phapha ra o thuba
And since vele vele xoxo ne xoxo
Liyaz' nyobela
Wena ufun'uk nyotjelw' ubani, hauw
Booty's soft I'm ripping the buttons off
If money talks I'm willing to shut up all night
Nothing lost re shapa twalatsa all night
In the backseat cause wena ha wa  (ha wa fasa) ha wa fasa
Ha wa fasa  (ha wa fasa)
Ha wa fasa
Ha wa fasa

[Hook + Bridge:]
Robbery, robbery, robbery (all eyes on me)
Robbery, robbery, robbery (all eyes on me)
Robbery, robbery, robbery
Stick em up & freeze
While I steal the show
It's a robbery

[Verse 3: Da L.E.S]
You know it always come back down to the H
At this stage of the game
I let the champagne out the cage
I got a Jesus on my chain
A bunch of Greygoose in my veins
A couple of bad bitches from the States
Skateboard's in my bedroom wall
I had to take it back to the north 9 4
Dollies on my penthouse floor
Now it's all white parties on a stretched out lawn, North
These streets is cold
You on the outside smoking sticks & stones
I'm all about mine like Patrice's gold
And I ain't gon' stop till I reach my goal (Y'all ain't fucking with me)
Leaked nudes on the iPad (gcwala)
Previews on the Snapchat (ziyawa)
Cause I'm popping off (shower)
Like 'em Naija boys

[Outro: Da L.E.S]
Alright, roundabout now I wanna bring everybody's club status right back down to the ground level
Big shout out to Pink Cadillacs
Russell the Love Muscle, Boogey Harry, R.I.P Aldo Mr Who's-who, Grant Chikwane, Shibabadu Shibabu
And of course we can't forget Kick-ass Kenny Mastry
Cause now we in the mainstream
Now fuck with the A-Team
We out
