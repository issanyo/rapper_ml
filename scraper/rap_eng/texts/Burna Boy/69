[Intro: Praiz]
I wanna lay inside you .. I wanna live inside you

[Verse 1: Praiz]
Ride you like I'm on a high-way
I'm gonna love you over and over, lay-back
Side-to-side knocking sideways
You know you're gonna get it right, tonight
From the couch, to the table, on the floor, to the wall
Take you places never been before
No penniless could ride-away .. yeah
Lemme come into you
Baby, you want me to
I'm ready to do the things you want

[Chorus: Praiz]
I wanna lay inside you
Can know I deserve you
I wanna live inside you
Feel me inside you

[Verse 2: Burna Boy]
I tell Monica bye-bye, she gon' scream my name
She say she can't hang when I'm with my crew
I need you now, wanna take my time
Girl, I'm really tryna find out if you remember me
The nigga you gave your virginity
Cummin', I see .. If you feel the same, when I put it in, eh
I know you' been, eh .. fucking couple more niggas
Tryna to get it ready for a nigga
Don't you see a nigga looking at you looking good?
I've been having thoughts, why you're always getting cautious
You know, I gather the numbers
See her simulating answers, look who the Boss is
Like fuck you know her, how a nigga see me so deep
You wonder; When? If he saw me
You need to come to my side and see how I rock her side

[Chorus: Praiz]
I wanna lay inside you
Can know I deserve you
I wanna live inside you
Feel me inside you
I wanna lay inside you
Can know I deserve you
I wanna live inside you
Feel me inside you

[Verse 3: Ikechukwu]
I've been puttin' in time
I've puttin' in work
One laps your mile
Stacking up in them Brooks
Tryna take a dive in your pool
Not, coming up for no-air dip
Tissue-wipe my face-fix with lil' tender loving and care
You get the right stroke, to the left-stroke
To the back-stroke, to the breast stroke, yea
High note with a side note
With a tied-rope and let's smoke
Look at the way that sheâ€™s walking
She gat the hoof-loafer booty with beau
She never wasting time talking
She loving leaving you niggas confused
Whipping your waist ..
Watching you whipping, whipping your waist
Back in the days, loving you were C-sitting on my face
All up in chains, loving it when I am being the slave
Throw in-to you-ou

[Chorus: Praiz]
I wanna lay inside you
Can know I deserve you
I wanna live inside you
Feel me inside you
I wanna lay inside you
Can know I deserve you
I wanna live inside you
Feel me inside you

[Outro: Praiz]
I wanna lay inside you .. I wanna live inside you
