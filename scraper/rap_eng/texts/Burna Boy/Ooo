And I ain’t got no money out
Fuck with me, imma pull up in your mummy 'ouse
Smokin' on a lot shit and you know the money long
Skrrr skrrr (yeah) skrrr

[Chorus: Wizkid]
She no wan' leave me alone

Everyday she calling up a nigga on the phone (yeah)
I wanna beat and when I beat I gotta go (yeh, yeh)

[Verse 1: Wizkid]

[Hook: Zingah]
I tell her fuck it up (fuck it up)
Think that I'm in love, ah
Think you just feel like a drug, ah
Got me feeling lawless
Might just wrap the night up with a mugshot, yeah
Think I’m feeling something love-like
But she got a man
He just wanna pay for bottles
He ain't gotta wait it
Just trynna throw the racks on 'em
But she got a man
He just wanna pay for bottles
He ain't gotta wait it
Just trynna throw the racks on 'em

[Chorus: Zingah]
She want the D, yea I know
I told her please, get on the phone
Meet me at the crib, I'm all alone (I'm by myself)
Fuck up the VIP, and then I'm gone

[Verse 2: Zingah]
I see him runnin' out of options
Throwin' money out
Calling mummy's house
Jumpin' on the couch
Clearly takin' losses
Cause we own this house
Always hoeing down
All these hoes in here be
Swimmin' like a dolphin
Baby, lets take this business to my office
I’ll hit up party, we can take this to the Lord's crib (church)
If you believin' in my sausage
If you’re the boss
Just wait until I tell her

[Hook: Zingah]
Fuck it up (fuck it up)
Think that I'm in love, ah
Think you feel just like a drug, ah
Got me feeling lawless
Might just wrap the night up with a mugshot, yeah
Think I’m feeling something love-like
But she got a man (fuck him)
He just wanna pay for bottles
He ain't gotta wait it (no, no)
Just trynna throw the racks on 'em
But she got a man
He just wanna pay for bottles
He ain't gotta wait it
Just trynna throw the racks on 'em

[Chorus: Zingah]
She want the D, yeah I know
I told her please, get on the phone
Meet me at the crib, I'm all alone (I'm by myself)
Fuck up the VIP, and then I'm gone

[Verse 3: Burna Boy]
Burna Boy, man I'm boss
Always on some crazy shit
And I keep 'em coming like it's baby shit
I don't wanna talk, me I rather do that shit
I ain't with that (?) 'maybe' shit
(?)
I don't know if you're real
Or you're fake
You my own, bitch
Why you still in my face
Revvin' thru the interstate
Please don't stay
In my way
You can see it in my face
While the (?) fuckin' (?)
Had to pop my braids
I remember I was workin' like a slave
Ten toes down 'til the grave
Now I'm seein' six figures everyday

[Hook: Zingah]
I tell her fuck it up (it up)
Think that I'm in love, ah
Think you just feel like a drug, ah
Got me feeling lawless
Might just wrap the night up with a mugshot, yeah
Think I’m feeling something love-like
But she got a man (fuck it)
He just wanna pay for bottles
He ain't gotta wait it (no, no)
Just trynna throw the racks on 'em
But she got a man
He just wanna pay for bottles
He ain't gotta wait it
Just trynna throw the racks on 'em (racks, racks, racks)

[Chorus: Zingah, Wizkid]
She want the D, yeah I know (I know, I know, I know)
I told her please, get on the phone (get on the phone, brrr)
Meet me at the crib, I'm all alone (I'm by myself)
Fuck up the VIP, and then I'm gone
