[Verse 1 - Yasmin & Lauren]
I give my body
It must count for something
Every time I talk 'bout love
You don’t say nothing
What are we doing?
It’s time you start choosing
And if I'm not the one
Please, keep it moving

[Pre-Chorus - Sophia]
If you can't tell me where I stand
I will find somebody who can

[Chorus - Caroline & Sophia & Lauren]
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
No, something ain't right
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
So, this is goodbye

[Verse 2 - Caroline & Yasmin]
So in love with my figure
When you’re drinking that liquor
Got me feeling like I’m the bae
But crop me out of your pictures
Can’t be seen in daylight
And you won’t do date nights
Anyone would think you’re ashamed
But it won’t make me cry

[Pre-Chorus - Lauren]
If you can't tell me where I stand
I will find somebody who can

[Chorus - Caroline & Sophia & Lauren]
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
No, something ain't right
You don’t wanna put your name on it, no no no no
You don’t wanna put your name on it oh no
You don’t wanna put your name on it
So, this is goodbye

[Bridge - Burna Boy]
Every time you said goodbye
You never, never look me in my eye
Girl, don't I give you everything you ask of me?
The love and my money
But now you want my name pon it
Yeah yeah
Baby gal, you know that's a challenge
'Cause everybody know man a savage, ah
My enemies go for the people I love
I try not to let 'em know
So when you done playin', you can come find me, find me
You'll never find another, 'nother like me

[Chorus - Caroline & Sophia & Lauren]
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
No, something ain't right
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
So, this is goodbye

[Outro - Caroline & Sophia]
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
You don’t wanna put your name on it
No, something ain't right
You don't wanna put your name on it
You don't wanna put your name on it
Just wanna put your hands on my body, on my body
