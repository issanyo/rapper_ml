Mama, don't run away
You know I got it, I know you want it
I'm a phone call away
You know you're on my mind
I know that you wanna stay
Let me take you to space
I can smell you from miles away
Wanna see you in lingerie
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You've got it, I want it
When I'm willing to put my all in
Wanna see you in the mornings
It should be me that you're callin'
You've got it, I want it
When I'm willing to put my all in
Wanna see you in the mornings
It should be me that you're callin'

And I don't wanna wait too long

[Verse 3 Don-E ]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
All these finders keepers
The way you look got me speechless
Let me take a deep breath
I like the way you roll up wearing nothing but your t-shirt on
Girl, you look better with no makeup on
Girl, you're a diamond, forever shinin'
Spend a likkle time on a liquor island
Have a couple drinks, catch a likkle whinin'
Girl, you know I'm the one for you
Girl, let me show you what a man can do
Girl, let me just put my hands on you
Girl, don't be scared, I'll take good care
I'll take you there if you want me to
Girl, you got me wanting all of this
I want a girl that can hug and kiss and have my kids
Girl, you're fitting that descript
I like the way you moving up your hips
Make me wanna come and just...

[Chorus: Mabel]
Put your arms all around it
Take it now that you've found it
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers
Put your arms all around it
Take it now that you've found it
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers
It's finders keepers
It's finders keepers
It don't need to be no deeper
It's finders keepers

[Post-Chorus: Mabel]

If you trust me then trust me

[Outro: Mabel]
It's you and me, you and me
So put your arms all around it
Around it, around it, around it
