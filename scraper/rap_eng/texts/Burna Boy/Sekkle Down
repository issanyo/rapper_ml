[Intro: Burna Boy]
Oh lord have his mercy
Oh lord have his, oh lord have his

[Verse 1: Burna Boy]
Hey gal
Lemme tell you wagwan
Lemme flow inna your ear like the River Jordan
Understand you want me, but you say y'ave a man
Then me reply and tell ya that it's not important ya know
Mi nah worship the ground she walk on
But she still ah want the lovin' from the Don Gorgan
Me ask her what her name, she tell mi say ah Karma
Say she come from Ethiopia, Addis Ababa

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
Affi sekkle, sekkle, sekkle, sekkle, sekkle
Sekkle, sekkle down pon me
Too many different type of gal inna the party
So one of them just haffi come whine pon mi
Sekkle, sekkle, sekkle, sekkle, sekkle
Sekkle, sekkle down pon me
Too many different type of gal inna the party
So one of them just haffi come whine pon mi

[Verse 2: J Hus]
Always there when me call 'pon her
She know me I'm slow lover, so mi giving her the slow dagger
No say that's my likkle mama, don't come with your likkle drama
Girl I'm only picking on ya

[Chorus: Burna Boy]

[Verse 3: Burna Boy]
She say me have a hold pon her
I say mi ah hit it inna slow motion
And say mi ah slow lover
And a long time, man ah coming like soap opera
And see me take control of her
And believe me when mi take her clothes of her mi left her wetter than water
Anytime the gal them ah bring am their friend dem, they knock at pon mi door
I man shall welcome them with open arms
And you look so so beautiful
And so the gal dem have to

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
Sekkle, sekkle, sekkle, sekkle, sekkle

Too many different type of gal inna the party
So one of them just haffi come whine pon mi

Too many different type of gal inna the party
So one of them just haffi  come whine pon mi

[Outro: Burna Boy]
Hey gal

Lemme flow inna your ear like the River Jordan
Understand you want me, but you say have a man
Then me reply and tell ya that it's not important

Too many different type of gal inna the party
So one of them just haffi come whine pon mi
