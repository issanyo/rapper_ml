Aristokrat records
Aii, me say A to the R
Representing the world
One time
Me see roses everywhere
Close my eyes and drift cause I don't care
Listen girl, lets be proper
Me tell your daddy you get a sexy daughter
Till we have a daughter be my baby mother
Then we get time for loving to one another
Got me falling helplessly
Me can't correct none of the chemistry
We are kiss and caress ina me balcony
Feeling all alone nobody helping me
Make we jolly together everybody dancing
Together
Na so e suppose be
Come close my baby, don't be a stranger
Ah ah
Na so e suppose be
I say na so e suppose
So e suppose
Na so e suppose be
I say na so you suppose
Na so you suppose
Na so you suppose be
Jolly together everybody dancing together
Na so e suppose be
Come close my baby, don't be a stranger
Ah ah
Na so e suppose be
I say na so you suppose
So you suppose
Na so you suppose be
I say na so you suppose
Na so you suppose
Na so you suppose be
Baba e so pe mo buru gan
Yeâ€¦.ni suru na
Fun mi ni egusi ati fufu kan
See ebi n pami o
O fe ki n ku lo
O fe mu mi dani tori nkan ti mo so
Ah ah ah
Oh why
Baby that shit ain't right
Ain't right
Ye, girl you know me falling helplessly
Me can't correct na na the chemistry
We are kiss and caress ina me balcony
Feeling all alone nobody helping me
Jolly together everybody dancing together
Na so e suppose be
Come close my baby, don't be a stranger ah ah
Na so e suppose be
I say na so you suppose
So you suppose
Na so you suppose be
I say na so you suppose
Na so you suppose
Na so you suppose be
Jolly together everybody dancing together

Come close my baby, don't be a stranger ah ah

Roses everywhere
Close my eyes and drift cause I don't care
