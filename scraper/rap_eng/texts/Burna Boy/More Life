[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Hold one vibes
Put me drink 'pon ice (yeah)
Pree more life (ah)
Cuh we ah pree more life (yeah)
You know what it is
You know what I mean
You know what it is when you're with me
Hold one vibes
Cuh we ah pree more life

[Verse 1]
I done seen it all and
I done done it all I
Still can't see me stopping
I'm still scheming, plotting
Wake up every morning
Feel this burning hunger
I ain't get no younger
I can't help but wonder
Why me feel sad and blue
When me can't get no weed and juice
Please don't get it confused
All that I want to do is

[Chorus]
Hold one vibes
Put me drink 'pon ice (yeah)
Pree more life (ah)
Cuh we ah pree more life (yeah)
You know what it is
You know what i mean
You know what it is when you're with me
Hold one vibes
Cuh we ah pree more life
