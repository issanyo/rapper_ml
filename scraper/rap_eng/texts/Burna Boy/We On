[Intro]
[?]

[Verse 1]
Me and my mind are never coming back
Why the fuck is you on my ass
You know you can't hold me back
This new niggas ain't even gonna last
My bad, that I came too much
Oh, but it my fault
That you just can't love me any more
Told ya, I'mma get it on my own
Bossing up that's all I know
I just got these fuckin' black brods
Ask what the fuck I'm gon' do
I'm gonna

[Chorus]
Snapchat in a fur coat
Always got the fam real close
Snapchat in a Lambo
How fast is you gon' go? (ah, ah, oh we)
This is the shit that we on, on, on
I smoke a zip of that strong, strong, strong
Smoking that thing 'til it's gone, gone, gone
Niggas gon' ride to my song, song, song
Snapchat in a fur coat
Always got the fam real close
Snapchat in a Lambo
How fast is you gon' go? (ah)

[Verse 2]
Is it me you're looking for?
I ain't really mean to call
I been wildin' on my tour
And the only number I could think of, was yours
Think I had way too much to drink
Took my chain off and lost a link
Spent so much think I broke the bank
Cause I told ya, I'mma get it on my own
Bossing up that's all I know
I just got these fuckin' black brods
Ask what the fuck I'm gon' do
I'm gonna

[Chorus 2x]
Snapchat in a fur coat
Always got the fam real close
Snapchat in a Lambo
How fast is you gon' go? (ah, ah, oh we)
This is the shit that we on, on, on
I smoke a zip of that strong, strong, strong
Smoking that thing 'til it's gone, gone, gone
Niggas gon' ride to my song, song, song
Snapchat in a fur coat
Always got the fam real close
Snapchat in a Lambo
How fast is you gon' go? (ah)
