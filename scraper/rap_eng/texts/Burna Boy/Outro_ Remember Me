[Chorus]
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Let me get ya twizted man
Let me get ya twizted man
Let me get ya twizted man
Let me get ya twizted man
2x
Teach 'em who the illest
Show 'em who the realest
Who can make ya feel it?
Ha, ha who?

[Verse 1]
You see me hit the ground runnin'
A hundred miles and still gunnin'
I might be the coldest nigga that ever done it
I hit 'em with the flow that'll get me paid
Money, at the same time in the game ya can't touch this
Smooth with the roughness, thuggish ruggish
I put a little bit of singing with it, and they love it (Rugged)
Put 'em all in the bucket
Busted, lyrical killa to get dusted (dusted!!)
I can tell how you bite my style, you can mean good
But I'm finna shut 'em all down (all down)
All y'all fall down
Mista Sawed Off, raw dawg
I'm tellin' y'all now (y'all now)
Y'all better get ready for Ball'R Records and ThugLine
Caught up in the rapture, we got ya just after one rhyme
They don't really wanna get it on
They don't wanna see the Bone, Bone
We can take it to the middle of the floor yo, harass them niggaz
Get up in 'em like the po-po's
Still flow, so cold
Krayzie jackson blazin' at ya Aimed exactly atcha, gotcha
Shots will drop ya, fade ya propa
Rock the spot and make ya holla "Dolla bill y'all"
Make a mill with my real dawgs
Wit the down niggaz, and I feel yall
Gotta kick it with the trill always, gotta chill with a ill squad
That'll really feel y'all, y'all, y'all
Bone still doin' it to 'em
No matter who in the room or who in the build'
No matter who close the show
You ask the party people who stole it though, they know

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They don't really wanna rumble, ya seen us
Split 'em while I hit 'em
Nigga did him in the first verse
If y'all suckas wanna work, nigga take off ya skirt
And drop ya purse
And I'ma do you like it hurt (word up!)
Keep a Burna when I'm heated, get up in 'em like the automatic nine millimeter
Drop a bomb on a nigga
It's the, original thugs, the criminals love us
'Cause we give 'em somethin' to bump, the music is murder
Nigga y'all rememba "No Surrender"
Then we hit 'em up on the "First of Tha Month"
And everbody got scared when the niggaz said "Dear Mr Ouijia"
Now I'm up in the club, in the cut with the Thugs
Puffin' on bomb ass bud
Finna show 'em how to flow when I pour a lil mo' drinkie, drink off in my cup
I still take a lil' Hen mix it with a lil Gin
Shake, shake it all in (all in)
A lil' somethin' that I made up, sip it with a friend
New drink I call Syn (Syn)
And if you want it nigga' we can get it crackin'
We can get into some action if you really wanna battle me
Money on the wood make the bank go good Money outta sight might start a fight (aight?)
You ain't neva heard anotha like me
Smooth with the roughness and, sucka free
Show 'em how I do it for these, wannabes
I let them suckas know they ain't runnin' with none of these (nigga please)
So cold I better freeze anything, thinkin' they hot
Thinkin' they not, easy to drop
Nigga y'all can believe it or not
I'm back on the block
I'm takin' my spot back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Y'all better believe I keep it comin'
Let 'em ride to the rhythm of a criminal, yes sir
I'm willin' ta bet cha' when I unload, I reload
I aim it and dump, dump some mo'
First sucka jump off, it's gon' blow
Then them other niggaz playa hate they don't really
Understand how I come back and I manage to do this amount of damage When they run into the static so you know we get to handlin'
Hangin' out the back, grandaddy of the Cadillac
Better get up off me, I'm a really crabby nigga
If I gotta release it, I guess I gotta be a killa
Get 'em with anotha thrilla, will pop off like a gorilla
They be waitin' on Krayzie 'cause ain't nobody reala (Now)
Everybody wanna know if Krayzie comin' with a gun
And now I make 'em feel it, if ya really think I'm bullshittin'
Blowed up, I'm comin' for ya
Why you on some paranoia, murda mo we go, go, go
Money is the one and only mission
If it's gettin' too heated then nigga stay up out the kitchen
You trippin', you ever need a fixin?
Well come on and see your nigga
The shit I finna bring to these shows will make ya feel it (can ya feel it?)
I be runnin' so fast on a nigga, they don't even see me comin' like Shaq (yup, yup)
But every know and then I gotta catch my wind
So let me take a second catch my breath (whoo)
I'ma take this breatha but you know I won't ease up tonight
(no, I won't ease up tonight)
'Cause I still get at that ass fast or slow (slow)
If you wanna see me with some paper partner pay the price (pay the price)
Who coldest flow? Ho's this you know

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yo
I'm in the house now, for sure
Krayzie Bone, Lil Jon on the track
(Bone Bone Bone Bone Bone)
