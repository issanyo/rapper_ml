[Intro]
Yo turn my headphones up a likkle bit
You can lock the locks, but you can't stop the clocks
Freedom is a must, get me

Got some problems, problems, problems
Can somebody show me a way that I can solve them
They calling police and they saying that I robbed him
They calling for back up, bringing the whole squad in
Now they screaming get on the floor, they got me crawling
Now they slapping cuffs on my wrists, I'm getting brought in
I can explain officer, but they would not let me
Anything I say, will be used against me
So its best that I surrender gently
And they would provide a lawyer to defend me
I ain't got to say bad 'bout the law I demanded, I still got remanded

Da-da-da-da-deh-da-da-deh-da-da-do
Now I get feds everywhere that I go
And I wanna take a piss and security follows
When I go to court, holding my bible [X2]

I got some problems, problems, problems
Can somebody show me a way that I can solve them
They calling police and they saying that I shot him
Now I'm on the news, cops saying, 'Yeah we got him'
My father complaining, and my mama bawling
There's just the problems, problems, problems
All over the news like Osama Bin Laden (Ayy)

Judgement shall reach them [X3]

All I want is freedom, they don't wanna set me free
And my PO don't want to let me be, got me feeling like he obsessed with me
So I get that done, so I tell em I ain't going back to jail
I ain't going to spend my whole life in a cell
Tryna spend my life doing well, tryna spend my life doing well
Tell me what I got to do, to prove to you
That I'm a changed man, won't do the same thing
Was stuck in my ways, but now I've changed
And them times that left my brain

Da-da-da-da-deh-da-da-deh-da-da-do
Now I get feds everywhere that I go
