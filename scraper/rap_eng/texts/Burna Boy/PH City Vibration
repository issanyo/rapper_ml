[Intro]
Its an R and Bits property people

[Chorus]
I grew up in a place called PH City
And if you see me

Wo wo wo wo
Southside of the river'a the garden city
Catch the vibe and the feeling

All protocols observed

Tell dem say I no fear

Who goes there o?

Be like say una don forget say me gun dem get reload'e

And if you never really go there, then you will really never know

[Verse 1]
Dey there man'o
You know me abi Port Harcourt boy original
And I was born inna the teaching hospital
The 2nd of July of 1991
I no dey stay too far from Liberation stadium
And I dey chop bole and fish and yam
And everybody know say man'a risk and dang
Southside official, Takwa badman
Remember when we frequent police station
And if you never understand no vibration
Take you to rumuigbo where the high grade burn
Da Psychiatric road dat'a my place man
If anybody ask, make you tell them

[Chorus]
I grew up in a place called PH City
And if you see me

Southside of the river'a the garden city
Catch the vibe and the feeling
Plus this how we living

[Verse 2]
And we get sinister
Know say Niger Delta boys no trust no minister
That's the reason why dem'a burst the cylinder
I swear to god you no go see small pikin ya
Even small pikin no be su'mall pikin ya
My father na Port Harcourt boy original
Even my mother sef na Port Harcourt original
My sister're and me Port Harcourt original
My sister Nissi na Port Harcourt girl original
Me come from the home'a the smooth criminal
Deadly striker, we n'attack no subliminal
Me go to Rumumasi when I get spiritual
Victory baptist church next to cathedral
Where Pastor Badu d'a the holy man
Him tell me say I woulda be the chosen one
Long before me like up the woolen gown
Me tell you something better, listen closely man


[Chorus]
I grew up in a place called PH City
And if you see me
Me dawgs dem with me
Wo wo wo wo
Southside of the river'a the garden city
Catch the vibe and the feeling
Plus this how we living

Goes there!
Left, right, front and rear
All protocols observed
Goes there!
Tell dem say I no fear
I know say my coast clear
Who goes there o?

Be like say una don forget say me gun dem get reload'e
Who goes there o?

And if you never really go there, then you will really never know

[Verse 1]
