[Intro]
Straight crease, we ova here
My man dem a busy
My man dem dey easy
Man dem a, oh yeah, heee

[Chorus]
My man dem a, fight for dem right like Nelson Mandela
My man dem a, still do the road 24/7 inna London a
Is my man dem a, gun dem a rise up just like antennas
Ohhhh, man dem a, man dem a, man dem a, man dem a

[Verse 1]
I see me on road with the man dem, don't know don't know
Man se man, like he be in a phantom, don't know don't know
Tell me what have I gone through
Couple man in jail, couple man still on a run too
And everything get outta control
Vespa pop, anytime dem a dem control
Mandem ma, bad man na black brothers
Skin wrap in a bandana
Roll up in a jeep, nightime wey ya crip
Lock up the road when dem man dem rage
Mama tell me, watch the freinds wey ya keep
Obviously she dont know about me
Mama my men are out here in the streets
She ain't even got to worry about me
Me tell you about

[Chorus]
My man dem a, fight for dem right like Nelson Mandela
My man dem a, still do the road 24/7 inna London a
Is my man dem a, gun dem a rise up just like antennas
Ohhhh, man dem a, man dem a, man dem a, man dem a

[Verse 2]
Street loads of man dem a smoking
Na the best we ya deal with
none of my mandem pon no ju thing
All of my mandem da the realest
Can't tell what dem mandem ma thinking
When dem mandem start drinking
Some of dem man dem chop out de bandoo
Don't know don't know
Couple man living a bike life, real bikers
Free all dem mandem pon locked up
Some of dem mandem ……
This is for my younsters
Reckless, going bunkers
Tryna make a name for themselves out here
This is for my olders, stop manipulating youngers
Getting them to put in all the dirt work
God!!

[Chorus]
My man dem a, fight for dem right like Nelson Mandela
My man dem a, still do the road 24/7 inna London a
Is my man dem a, gun dem a rise up just like antennas
Ohhhh, man dem a, man dem a, man dem a, man dem a

[Verse 3]
When dem man dem get stopped by police
Se dem man dem don't speak
Se na about they interrogate me
Na dem mandem keep secret
If you're not from around here, you just can't relate
And if you never ever see it, you just might not believe it

[Chorus]
My man dem a, fight for dem right like Nelson Mandela
My man dem a, still do the road 24/7 inna London a
Is my man dem a, gun dem a rise up just like antennas
Ohhhh, man dem a, man dem a, man dem a, man dem a

[Bridge]
My man dem a, man like Freaky
My man dem a, my man dem a, man like Oneway
My mandem ma, my mandem ma, heee, man like AB
My mandem ma, my mandem ma, man like Oneway
My mandem ma, my mandem ma, heee, rest in peace Gambo
My mandem ma, my mandem ma, lord, man like Lani
My mandem ma, my mandem ma, lord, man like Sints
My mandem ma, my mandem ma, lord, man like Joe
My mandem ma, my mandem ma, lord, man like Just
Get me, man like strider
Uncle T I didn't forget you
Man like Ace
