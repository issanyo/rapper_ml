[Verse 1: Lily Allen]
Not gonna lie but this might be dying
Surprised 'cause I thought you were alright
Feels like every night we're fighting
No, please don't sigh
Yeah, it's all fine

[Chorus: Lily Allen]
Stop crying every time I get a text
Every time my phone rings
Don't be upset, baby
I've always said that no man can own me
If you really wanna go, that's fine, bih
That's your choice, not mine

[Verse 2: Burna Boy]
Everything is bless
Last night full of happiness
Pon the bed, we a kiss and caress
After the sex, your phone deh pon the side ah me a rest
And this morning you get a text
And even though me vex
Me nah gon' say nothing, me nah gon' stress
Me just a reason with your conscience
I got to know, oh my girl, I know

[Chorus: Lily Allen]
Stop crying every time I get a text
Every time my phone rings
Don't be upset, baby
I've always said that no man can own me
If you really wanna go, that's fine, bih
That's your choice, not mine

[Refrain]
Nunna, nunna, nunna

[Verse 3: Lily Allen]
I'm kinda bored of this back and forth thing
Not gonna war with you, let's enjoy this time
Fuck what you saw 'cause I'm not tryna draw for him
Boy, be nice, I'm yours all night

[Chorus: Lily Allen]
Stop crying every time I get a text
Every time my phone rings
Don't be upset, baby
I've always said that no man can own me
If you really wanna go, that's fine, bih
That's your choice, not mine

[Verse 4: Burna Boy]
Tell dem send it back
Gyal this ah the real thing? The mack
Girlfriend cotch and relax
Mek me tell you all the facts
Cah you never know say me bad
Original foundation badman
Me know say you a freak
And you need a thug inna di sheets
You know say me a thug inna di street
Got everything you need
You know I'm the man, I'm your man
And me nah play number two
So why do you want it?
You can keep rocking the boat
It's like we're listening to Aaliyah
The way we go back and forth
Girl, I'm not speaking no more
I know you're bad like Marilyn Monroe
I see fire in your love

[Chorus: Lily Allen]
Stop crying every time I get a text
Every time my phone rings
Don't be upset, baby
I've always said that no man can own me
If you really wanna go, that's fine, bih
That's your choice, not mine
