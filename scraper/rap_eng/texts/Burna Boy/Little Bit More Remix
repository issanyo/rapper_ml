[Intro]
Are we ever gon' know?
You should make up your mind
Take you back to my shrine
And I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more

[Chorus]
I'm gonna need the whole night
They don't know how you like it
I'm gonna need the whole night
I'ma need the whole night and a little bit more
I'm gonna need the whole night
They don't know how you like it
I'm gonna need the whole night
I'ma need the whole night and a little bit more

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got the feeling you've been here before
You needed tonight like a weekend ago
You in or you out? Are you playin' or foldin'
We in need of a moment

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we ever gon' know?
You should make up your mind
Take you back to my shrine
Don't you play dem no mind
Let dem be
Let dem go
She was made for my eyes
We escape the times
And I'ma need the whole night
And a little bit more

[Chorus]
I'm gonna need the whole night
They don't know how you like it
I'm gonna need the whole night
I'ma need the whole night and a little bit more
I'm gonna need the whole night
They don't know how you like it
I'm gonna need the whole night
I'ma need the whole night and a little bit more

[Verse 2: Burna Boy]

'Cause she waan me a marry to the whine
So mama, yarn wit me, yarn wit me, yarn

They don't know how you like it
I'm gonna need the whole night
I'ma need the whole night and a little bit more
