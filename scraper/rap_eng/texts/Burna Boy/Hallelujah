[Verse 1]
Last night some boy try kill me off
Shoot up mi car only God mek mi drive off
Had to thank God seh mi jump and fast

So my music go stop to dey play
You probably hear seh my papa don die
Cause my momma don cry taya
And thats why

[Chorus]
Mi affi give the most high praise
For the air I breath
Aaah! For the rivers and trees
Aeyeaa! Mi affi give the most high praise!
For the air I breath
Woo! For the rivers and trees
And so mi sing

Halle hallelujah
Halle hallelujah

[Verse 2]
It’s been long history
Since I had a talk with you
So I had to take this time to be alone with you
Because all my blessings come from you
All my life I don dey follow you
Tho am caught up in the money and the fame
You still bless me anyway

[Chorus]
Mi affi give the most high praise
For the air I breath
Aaah! For the rivers and trees
Aeyeaa! Mi affi give the most high praise!
For the air I breath
Woo! For the rivers and trees
And so mi sing
Halle hallelujah
Halle hallelujah
Halle hallelujah
Halle hallelujah

[Verse 3]
I’ve been on the road
In the water with no boat
I don’t even know
How I manage to dey float
When no be say na me
Wey holy holy the most
Abi no be so?
And I still dey wonder why you still dey bless me
When am acting like I don’t know you
Acting like I don’t know you
Forgive me father
When am acting like I don’t know you
Acting like I don’t know you

[Bridge]
Thank God God no be man oh
Cause if God be man oh I for don die aeyeaa
I for don kpeme oh
Thank God God no be man oh
Cause if God be man oh I for don die oh
I for don kpeme oh

[Chorus]
Mi affi give the most high praise
For the air I breath
Aaah! For the rivers and trees
Aeyeaa! Mi affi give the most high praise!
For the air I breath
Woo! For the rivers and trees
And so mi sing
Halle hallelujah
Halle hallelujah
Halle hallelujah
Halle hallelujah
