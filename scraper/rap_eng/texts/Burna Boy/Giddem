Giddem Giddem na

If you see me with a foreign gyal
In the front seat of a foreign car
I know you know what I’m coming for
So there’s no use in asking what I want
I’ve been cruising through the sunshine now
I’m just tryna wol a viber now
They saw me while I roll up shorty
Girl you know what’s going on

Cuz I come to Giddem now, Giddem now

Why you no go gree make I enter ah
You know I fresh pass Jidenna
Everybody know my agenda
And for your love I be defender
Anytime any day for the calendar
