I thank God for my life…yea yea o o o
I’ve been through a lot and I swear
E don make me believe
I thank God for his grace
And all his blessings
Lord I thank you
And I praise you everyday of my life
Say, see I don hear bad things about me
Say, I’ve seen my real nigga act so funny for money
Oh oh oh
Them say I no go blow
Them say I just dey jonz
But look at me now
And tell me guy who’s jonzing
Just steady getting money
See am in my zone

[Wizkid]
They call me one this, one that
One album wonder
But I still dey today
Baba lo shey fun mi
I went from the under
No more jumping okada
Am too bad o
Baba lo shey fun mi
When them see me they say ajuwaya
I make quack niggas hang for wire
Say they got to know
They got to know
Jah love is true

[Burna Boy]
They call me mixtape wonder
Watch out for thunder
I still dey today
Baba lo shey fun mi
Went from a Honda and hopping okada
We still dey today
Baba lo shey fun mi
When they see me
Them say ajuwaya
Me say Babylon hang for wire
But they got to know
They got to know
Jah love is true

[Burna Boy]
Dem a pree, dem say me a target
Them say me can’t shine in a market
No them never start it
No them never start it
Cause I can burst
You can burst
Tell me what’s the point If we both get hurt
Mehn act like you never knew my worth
Babylon trying, *****
Say what have I done
Now am standing out as a fucking icon
Instead, them want me to be bussin my gun
Make them start
Them fit run run run run run
There is fire on the mountain
Them so biased that them put on fires
And make wan take out them teeth with pliers
Them use gasoline, fit try to put on tires
Never compare fresh air to air dryers

[Wizkid]
