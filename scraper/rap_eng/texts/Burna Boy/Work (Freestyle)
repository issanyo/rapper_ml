[Verse 1]
I’ve been stuck in my own world
Fuck my ex and her home girls
I swear I ain’t been sober
Since she told me it was over
Ooooh that was fucked up
Girl the last time you seen me was fucked up
You know I said some things
You said some things
Neither of us ain’t really mean em
Woah ain’t mean to hurt your feelings
Yeahh! bitch I know you see me
From the rats and the flies and the roaches
To the mansions with gardens and roses you know i
Work work work work work
Yuh see seh man ah work work work work work
Bitches getting on my nerves nerves nerves nerves nerves
They love the way I work work work work work
I’m smoking the herb herb herb herb herb
Sensi man ah burn burn burn burn burn
When you ah go learn learn learn learn learn
To the pussy me return turn turn turn turn

My car haffi park inna your garage
Get ready for me baby
Ah me alone do it me na bring entourage
Yuh fi run put it pon me baby
When she dey around me everything nice
Me see happiness when me look in her eyes
Girlfriend tell her say she nuh wan fight
She just want di don fi make her feel alright
I’ve been on a cold dark road
Tryna find my way home
Girl all alone
Sorry I ain’t talk to you on the phone

[Hook]
A nigga had to work work work work work
Yuh no see seh man ah work work work work work
Money man ah search search search search search
Man ah hustle man ah work work work work work work
Me do me dirt dirt dirt dirt dirt
Anything fi earn earn earn earn

Daddy haffi work work work work work work

Mmmmmmmmmm…
How we wake up and everything is wrong
How many times we gotta go down this road girl
Could be blind but I can see right through your soul girl
You was mine but now you just my old girl
But it’s fine cuz I’ve adapted to this cold world
Because relationships ain’t meant for me
No it wasn’t meant to be
All the hardest things to do for me
Are all the things you never see

[Outro]
