[Verse 1: T-Mo]
As I begin fall in, I spark the riot, no longer quiet
I got a voice that's in ya ear, stand clear
It's madness everywhere I look
But can't see, so much I can't explain how I feel on the real
Every day is like a ferris, looking to find some wheels
Homey after homey dying over humbug
Keeping my mind immune to pain
I'm going insane just thinking about the past
At last it's a future I can see much more that I got older
So I know how the game goes telling me like I can't cope
It's the dope you smoke
That's why you looking at me ready to jack
'Cause that crack got your back broke
Have to learn the hard way out the hood
Thank it's real when it's flaw
I saw this nigga get shot in front of my school, it wasn't cool
That gangsta shit affects not poppin' off just da 'jects
360 degrees all due with respect

[Hook: Witchdoctor]
It's the comin' of the killin' tool click...
Atlanta got a killin' tool, watch me rule, bitch
Killin' tool click
Watch the killin' tool, watch the killin' tool click

[Verse 2: Witchdoctor]
Waa-taaah, tha angelical Ninja when you blink
You'll need a shrink, how the fuck did you think
That I could be sniped nigga
See, you fuckin' right I'mma try to kill ya, straight drill ya
I take my fuckin' life serious
You attack my self-defense is war, period
I know niggas all over the SWATS
Niggas that'll get in yo' ass on the spot
Concoct like a wise wizard
Just 'cause I wear the red eye, you may think I'm a high nigga
But looks could be deceiving
God lives within me, and brother, I feel him
I speak to God before I take my gat and juice ya
'Cause he the one that's holding my future
See as you learn me, you journey out of time
'Cause your present state, I gotta take ya out ya mind
Y'all done let the devil tear your perfect world up
Got men sleeping wit men and girls wit girls
Seems all right to you, hey but to me, that's taboo, yes I do
Fuck the dumb shit, I comes wit, drums hit
Some get the hummin' comin from the Witchdoctor's gun in
Killin' tool click
Khujo, come with the killin' tool click

[Verse 3: Khujo]
Bill wash my mouth out with soap
Sent you home with yo' shit pokin out
The loft shoutin' out obscenities
No, it's just a dream, but I'm a sore loser
Flag murderer, crosses burnin' in my front yard
KKK throwing them rallies, but no, not no more
In these parts, trespassers gets penalized...
2:13 A.M., basic nine channel surfin'
This one-eyed monster servin' it's purpose
Clampett's biggest hustle, nineteen-ninety-nine
Three dollars plus shippin' 'n' handlin'
Major credit card holders accepted, but I'm a minority
Septic tank on ABC...
Turner Broadcasting niggas already done took over this bitch
System just still runnin'... to be or not to be done in
At the push of a button is the question
I think they got this bitch rigged to blow up in my face
Duddy the first African-American to walk in space
Now who you think had the pleasure, of tryin' on they new shit
The nightmare continues, are we just penny gig's

[Hook: Witchdoctor]
Comin' with the killin' tool click...
Come back to rule, bitch
Comin' like the killin' tool click
Killin' tool click, killin' tool click
Atlanta got a killin' tool click
Come back to rule, bitch
Comin' like the killin' tool click
Tool click, tool click, tool click...(East Point...)

[Verse 4: Big Gipp]
On the concrete is where I make my money at
On this concrete is where I make my living at
On this concrete is where your blood can flow
On this concrete, fool, if I don't get the dough
I'm pumpin' thangs out of suite 116
Got the Arab sewed up, stitched up, buckled up, buckle down, hit the sto'
7-Tre-1 as soon as I exit 166, traffic gettin' stuck, but fuck this
I hit the back streets, ended up coming down Childress
Ain't no space, cut through the Fina, so I park, I hit my usual
I tuck and hold, flip and fold, no life insurance, but I got my Grady card
Depress me, stress me, the same that exploit me
Suppress me, break Cam, run thinkin' of a son trying to see through tha fog
Just to see how far who's coming out the woods?

[Verse 5: Cee-Lo]
And I suggest you don't fuck wit us
(Ha ha ha) Cracker. you stuck wit us
And you know how long we been waiting for you
Devil, We know what you been contemplating to do
We have been here before, but surprise again
It is time for niggas to uprise again
But we've been down for so long that you wondering how
It ain't a weapon that you got that can stop me now
Because we don't die (Don't die) We won't die (Won't die)
And it won't get no better if we don't try (Don't try)
But don't get scared, nigga, get prepared
I gotta care 'cause the fuckin' devils never cared
So come and find us (Find us), get behind us (Behind us)
If you ain't hear the message clear, then rewind us (Rewind us)
'Cause we comin'
(We comin'...we comin', comin', comin' yeah)
