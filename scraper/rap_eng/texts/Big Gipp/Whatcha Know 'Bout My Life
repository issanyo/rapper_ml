[Chorus: Bud]
What you know, about my life
And what you know, about my struggles and strifes
Ima keep on hustlin', keep on grindin' everyday
Ima keep on runnin', until I find a better way

[Verse 1: Sho Nuff]
See you don't know my life, unless you read my book
Many struggles and hustles dealing with thieves and crooks
Real shit, really wasn't into bricks but nickel and diming when you hustle for strife, that's the meaning of grinding
Man I can't get a 9-5, what's the reason for a car when you ain't got no license to drive
Plus ya kids gotta eat, the struggle it runs deep
It's money in the streets, you don't work, you don't eat, can't sleep
I struggled everyday just to make it, my mother barely paying the bills she can't take it, can't hack it, twenty degrees with no jacket
Plenty bathrooms to lower the rick racket
The furniture in plastic, old school classic we, had to make the money stretch like elastic
My daddy had a habit (start trippin'), so they got a divorce ain't no remorse, we hustle grindin' by choice

[Chorus: Bud]
What you know, about my life
And what you know, about my struggles and strifes
Ima keep on hustlin', keep on grindin' everyday
Ima keep on runnin', until I find a better way

[Verse 2: Big Marc]
Single parent upbringing, no father figure, taught by them boys who move work, pimp and rob niggas
So I understand, why niggas sellin' grams, trapped in the hole being used in the devil's plan
Got nothing to lose with nothing to prove, turnin' down avenues that leave em stuck and confused
Shit got hard, mama had to work three jobs, my daddy left us out to hang so he could cake up broads
So I did what I did, shawty knowin' it's wrong
Ask the Lord to forgive and keep my family strong
Send the blessing in the form of a man, my big brother, never tried to diss homie, though we had different mothers
Showed me how to make the hustle official, how to grind without losing your mind and how to paint your own picture
Rollin' sticky in the swisher, still staying ten toes down on my feet to keep my back off the ground, it's Big Marc

[Chorus: Bud]
What you know, about my life
And what you know, about my struggles and strifes
Ima keep on hustlin', keep on grindin' everyday
Ima keep on runnin', until I find a better way

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
Expression is supposed to leave an impression, regression is discretion for those out here needing protection
Now who get clipped up, caught out here, flodgin' and flexin' I'm a southside nigga, I ain't into no plexin'
I made a hundred thousand dollars stack, back up in the 90s black, I'm holding chips out of Vegas I ain't cash yet
Canadian money I probably won't spend (in my safe)
Mongolian gin with Japanese yen (in my garage)
Exotic Cadillacs with chrome plated Benz
Seems like my team just can't lose, we ten in
First class liquor free that's me, yeah, hit the street one deep that's me, yeah
See I'm the king of the flip flops, king of the porkchops, king of the 89 dope knots, king of the dreamgirl off in ya world
Keep that paper coming steady, keep that dick in her world

[Outro: Bud, Sho Nuff & Big Marc]
I gotta stay on the grind, spendin all my time, keep on hustlin', everyday, you don't know about me, Ima keep on hustlin', what I gotta do, gotta what I gotta do

Yeah yeah man, if you ain't know, you already slow, it's the mufuckin' Backwudz puttin' it down one time homeboi, this ya boy right here man shicka Sho Nuff, ya hear me, the shogun of the south pimpin'
Yeah, it's ya boy Big Marc, the country hustler, aka Shittyville, the jolly green giant, nahmtalmbout, Backwudz, Major Way, Rowdy Records, we here now, believe that
