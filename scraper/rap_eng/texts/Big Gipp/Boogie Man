On some spooky dooky... spooky dooky
B-O-O-G-I-E M-A-N
You know the one who make y'all suckas wanna run
The one that make you wanna spend _ with your son
Nobody that I know no longer do this shit for fun I am the
B-O-O-G-I-E M-A-N
You know the one who make a suga drop her drawers
I dig her cause she's unashamed, she do me just because
She wanna and I wanna that's on the niagra falls I am the...

You can catch me in a white DTS with the top popped
Little buddy under my seat
It shoot hot rocks
Make the sucka Po' get loose
Jiggy purr with me shorty jiggy perm ya curl?
Candle lights the world swiftly
Big Gipp AKA decendant miracle mutant motherfuck from birth
I stay down for the ready-ready
Caught some media, spaghetti
Off in Japan they call me Yeti
I'm the Boogie Man

I'm Mr. Boogie Boogie from the goodie goodie Gipp
Put my oogie oogie between your camel foot, so stay put
A straight dog when I'm chasing the platypus
My intellectual qualities superior to most
I love a girl with a fat back
Knee cut, rack, toes showin, Po'
Holdin my eyes swollen
Cause I stare so hard, with no regard
Girl make that change, Shake that thang mama!

Touched what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun Sky high, sky high
Baby girl didn't even tell me bye-bye
She was gone without droppin the digits
She was gone without using my kitchen
She left without kissin my lips
One more time I wanna hold them hips
I hope we meet up again on a lunar eclipse
