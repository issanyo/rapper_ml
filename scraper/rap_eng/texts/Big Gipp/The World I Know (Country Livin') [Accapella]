Goodie Mob and Esthero - “The World I Know (Country Livin')”
[Produced (Remixed) by 2 Rude]

[Hook: Esthero]
The world I know is a world too slow
(If you) don't move fast enough, keep your head low
The world I know is a world much too slow
If you can't move fast enough chi-ild
You’d better stay on the low, child

[Verse 1: T-Mo]
Uh, my eyes are a glare. Uh
I'm looking up at this world from my stare and really don't know
Which way I'ma turn. I could get burned upon contact
I'm making a bad decision to get my pockets fatter one day
Support the very thang that supported me: my family
Gave me love. Yes, we struggle—that’s how we hustle
And bust up our knuckle for a better future in this game
Do your thang, get your cheese. Ain’t working for free

[Verse 2: Big Gipp]
Remember me from the state of the peach tree? Mountains to
The red dirt. Damn, it hurt, but it feel good to watch
My small time grow to a big city. More flow
Winter time, no snow. Big front yards
To backyards with the porches, lemonade. To the
Pine tree shade, short gangster fade, women every which-a way
If you’re missing out, you’re tripping. Gipp dipping
Loving all this country living. Baby, check it

[Hook: Esthero]
The world I know is a world too slow
(If you) don't move fast enough, keep your head low
The world I know is a world much too slow
If you can't move fast enough chi-ild
You’d better stay on the low, child

[Verse 3: Cee-Lo Green]
Yes, this is an invitation to indulge in interpretation
Literal lyrics of liberation, precious time taken
Making the needed sacrifices for a proper balance
I'ma portray all the virtues and vices, conveying the contents
A blue prism with four elements creates if a deed doesn't conflict with compliments
Common sense had the permissive wives. My rhymes are the action and the consequence
But I missed the ending in all realities. Really, in my life, trying to lead
Faces not seen, but you feel that they’ll still believe witches push the Sun
But this is how we've overcome the obstacles of oppression, overpowering where we’re from
Mu-sic is a chance to dream for me, and others tell like it is
Well, I tell it how I would like it to be, and we
Don't ration compassion—we give our all for y'all. So why's
Our following so small? Why’s our following so small?
Come on, come on

[Hook: Esthero]
The world I know is a world too slow
(If you) don't move fast enough, keep your head low
The world I know is a world much too slow
If you can't move fast enough chi-ild
You’d better stay on the low, child

[Bridge 1: Esthero]
And I want to lay in the passenger seat of a car
We could drive around all night
We wouldn't have to go too far
Just look at those stars
This night could be ours

[Verse 4: Khujo]
Profound, dreamy, defused, and difficult
To peer down rule. Bet another seven, often
Attracted to highly, imaginative objectives
Energy exert an irresistible magnetic
Influence, able to dissolve away barriers
Of a more rigid and absolute nature, mutatable
Flexible, varied, thus enabling me to adapt
To new circumstances. Easily bored, I can demand
Lots of excitement. Seeking a change
Of scenery more often than most, a worser pull of vanity
Seldom happier than when in motion
Emotionally unstable, Neptune is showing progression
In a counterclockwise direction
Designated as the winter solstice, a represent-
-ative of rebirth, quadrant number four
Thought a mode of apprehension, omnipo-sent
