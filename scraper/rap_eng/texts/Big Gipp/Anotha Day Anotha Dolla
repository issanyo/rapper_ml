Everybody know Stroud

[Hook]
Another day, another dollar
When your back against the wall and you’re tryna do right
But the bills pilin' up to the sky
Another day, another dollar
When the rent do again and the trap ain’t bumping
A nigga got to figure out something
Another day, another dollar

[Verse 1: Scotty ATL]
Now the dope boy tell me if he standing on the corner all morning
And his pocket look funny, I reply eye to eye
If the product 100 and the fiends ain’t coming
Something wrong with your hustle, I ain’t lying
It be look like a deer stuck, between your headlights
The rap yeen got it wrong in your head right
Everybody selling bricks in the city, that’s bullshit
Niggas ain’t even paying rent right
And this the good word, I put the stank on it
You can trust em but I wouldn’t really bank on it
Most of them got a scheme up their sleeve
They finessing, they’ll leave ya ass naked at the bank homie
And he was throwed off, he dropped out of school
Said his mama on drugs, tryna get some shoes
I felt bad for the homie cause I know he tryna get it
So I told him keep your head to the ceiling

[Hook]
Another day, another dollar
When your back against the wall and you’re tryna do right
But the bills pilin' up to the sky
Another day, another dollar
When the rent do again and the trap ain’t bumping
A nigga got to figure out something
Another day, another dollar

[Verse 2: Gipp]
Ralph got 9, Erick got 10
You can buy the whole truck if you come the weekend
Uncle Junior still on the porch, he selling that hooch
I can scrape the plate, make you sell the shake
Dixie Hill still got poor birds, I put a call in, got no word
Half the streets stay lying, half the dope wet
The molly ain’t real, this some crushed up pills
Now how the fuck I feel, this world out here, ain’t shit here real
I should’ve went to school, should’ve got a job
Should’ve heard mom, made me want to rob
You don’t know the feeling
When your stomach touch your back, you don’t know the feeling
Make an honest man go out and do the killing
This the life I’m living

[Hook]
Another day, another dollar
When your back against the wall and you’re tryna do right
But the bills pilin' up to the sky
Another day, another dollar
When the rent do again and the trap ain’t bumping
A nigga got to figure out something
Another day, another dollar

[Verse 3: Scotty ATL]
Pop called he be living in a small town
See in a small town everybody compound
Everybody in your biz, everybody always hatin'
Said Mike got locked up, a lot of pounds
It knocked the wind out me, cause I been going through it
And I was looking up to Mike, how they bang Cook?
I’m on the brink of blowing up, still tryna keep my head
All I need is some matches and some lighter fluid
They took my role model, that shit happen every day
Meanwhile at the crib I just pray
I want to grab a chopper and a mask
Hit the gas on the Chevy, tryna come up on another nigga’s cash
Naw, thought about it, took a couple pulls
My girl blowing up my phone, she be stressing too
It only take you one shot leave a nigga paralyzed
Spend the rest of your life as a vegetable
I pulled up on him, pistol in my hand
He had his head down, I’m slowly creeping in
Yanked the hood off his head, it was pastor from the church
Said he just prayed for me, keep working

[Hook]
Another day, another dollar
When your back against the wall and you’re tryna do right
But the bills pilin' up to the sky
Another day, another dollar
When the rent do again and the trap ain’t bumping
A nigga got to figure out something
Another day, another dollar
