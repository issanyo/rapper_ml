[Round 1: Hollow Da Don]
You retired for 3 hours and 32 seconds, you should hate yourself
How you got your own league, but you can't pay yourself?
So actin' like this ain't about money, is that somethin' you gon' say yourself?
That's like gettin' in my car, askin' for the auxiliary cord...we know you 'bout to play yourself
Against the god MC that got more than four fours for ya
I'll take your shit and beat you wit' it, I go John John on ya
You wanna get disrespectful?!
I'll spit on ya mom's mom's daughter
You wanna bring in a pool table? I'll do you like God's godfather
Cause a battle rap can turn into a crime scene from it
I mean my arsenal turn into Arsonal, you know he got somethin' mean comin'
My hit man turn into Hitman, it reload when that thing dumpin'
And Hollow turn to Blind Fury cause I ain't see nothin'
But I did see your scene in Bodied and your scene was throw
But it ain't about your scene it's what you did behind the scenes that seem so bold
He told a runner, "Put the beef on hold. I'm vegan so I need some toad
Fruit smoothie, keep the Coke."
Actin' diva though like Keisha Cole and you didn't even have a speakin' role
So quit all the actin', frontin', 'fore I start blackin' somethin'
You'll think about my last battle...I'll pull out extra caps for nothin'!
But y'all niggas actin' tough
And then y'all niggas backin' up
Y'all nigga money down, but y'all niggas be actin' up
Like for example, when you in the east you Rick Ross you throwin' up Triple C's
But we don't know if he down or not, he like the Wu-Tang Killa Bees
The young boy on my team? He Shyeim
He always with the beats
So before he lets them cap a don (Cappadonna) he'll Killa Priest
Nigga you got somethin' that you owe Hollow
So I load with the old hollow
(Hold up, hold up, stop my time)

{Hollow puts on the same jacket and hat he wore in his first battle against Arsonal on Fight Klub}

For me to really beat this nigga, I gotta turn into the old Hollow
I said, my machete diabetic, it's takin' off his left leg
Kill his baby mom and his baby with one bullet
Give her chest lead through the baby head while she gettin' breast fed
Put that Saw in that small room is a horror flick, I'm that hostile (Hostel)
I'll find the good (Goodz) and do him bad, I can Top you
I'll put the combinations in a sock and pad lock you
I'll nail both your feet to the floor and slap box you
Nigga I remember our first battle, legendary, a lot of shit got birthed
You was schemin' and you was doin' setups first
I mean they had me look crazy
You knew we was battlin' twice and that was fugazi
So you think I'ma let you come out on the 'Tube tied? I'm not havin' it baby
I said they did a whole lot to set up the best
You thought I'd die behind bars that first time? Well I didn't that's the Mandela Effect
I said, that year don't even exist, I'm an old mind shatterer, time traveler, rhyme battler
That go back in time and design calendars to find challengers
My mind patterns are cryptic I write backwards
The lines scatter, I decode 'em as I practice
Just to show that mine matters and my matters
I'll have his mind mattered they find scattered all over his wine China cabinet
Well I mic (Mike) jack it like I'm Bad-der
I said fuck boxing like Rocky in the meat freezer
I have him boxing with meat cleavers
I might go wave (microwave) was left over and reheat ya
Until then I'm masked up hittin' the set like a bee keeper

[Round 1: Arsonal]
Old Hollow told me this is light work, believe in me
I know this nigga the snitch type, he put that wire on easily
All lies, but he talk a good game, he's tryin' to Beasley me
T.I. in ATL, I can spot ya new new (NuNu) bullshit easily
They said, "Ars', we want that global Rasta."
Truth is, you don't even know ya father
You've been hangin' around a nigga named Troy's Ave and that's why this battle wasn't at Irving Plaza
Nigga, 2-2-3 bullet, banana clip where I load the chopper
Before the shot; Nigel Bennett, after the shot; Herman Munster
I'ma do you way worse than Surf did you, I'ma let these bullets flirt witchu
You gon' get your face blew (blue) off, they gon' think a Smurf hit you
Yeah the gun kick when it shoot, it got them dirt issues
Both pistols, got fired on purpose like the niggas no longer wanted to work witchu
To battle rap I'm on some God shit
Twins named "Nina" who you menage wit'
Two fine chicks, closest thing to a dime, right? Nonsense
Knowin' you gotta battle me after signin' that fine print
Is more dangerous than pocket dialin' wifey when you wit' ya side bitch
Nigga the look in ya eyes across that pool table, told me [?]
So go watch, I wouldn't be surprised if they thought it was photo shopped
Same night I spent them Fight Klub dollars right in the go-go spot
It's funny, nine years later the Tin Man found the heart now he think he Robocop
I don't give a fuck who you are, we can save all the Jazz, we ain't in Utah
I hang with real killers, I key niggas who will sneak they gun in a jumar
This like I passed my destination, I'm takin' this shit too far
I don't get caught at that red light cause that Harold ain't hang with Kumar
Nina, no holster though, my belt buckle fit it fine
Clip stickin' out the left pocket, I grab a different nine
You name the place and pick the time
Cause when all y'all intertwine
I'ma let it go like I'm over it, then let him have it like the shit ain't mine
Chest shot, hand on his heart, turn him to Red Foxx
Stomach shot, Wal-Mart exit, right by the RedBox
Then BAOW to the back of the cranium til yo' head pop
Then once you hit the ground, a Hulkamania leg drop
Road trip, steal his car as soon as he get to the rest stop
You best stop, cause this here, they can hear at the next stop
You'll be lyin' in your own puddle of blood, that's the best spot
Nigga, yo' bitch a squirter so don't act like you never slept in a wet spot
Man, after the hit, skkkrt, four Crips hop out the red Caddy
Whole bunch of hollows in Hollow, this nigga bled badly
Friday was on, I heard, "Put the gun down son. Fight like a man." It's in my head sadly
Funny thing is I never took advice from my own pops, fuck I look like listenin' to Craig daddy?
Smack, am I killin' this nigga?

[Hollow Da Don]
No

[Arsonal]
Shut up, I know I'm fryin'
I'm the type of nigga, I swear to God on your son, when I know I'm lyin'
Nigga there's too much disrespect, I'm startin' to get sick of myself
The kickback was so intense I almost injured myself
Big ass gun, got me lookin' like a midget myself
So I gotta shoot it with my arm fully extended like I'm tryin' to take a picture myself
Nigga, I can't get blood on my clothes, so I walk in with a poncho
He'll get robbed for his chicken and whine fool (waffle) cause I approached him with a Roscoe
I met yo' bitch at Sam's Club, she was givin' out BJ's in front of tacos
And tell your mother I want some fuckin' guacamole on my taco
You fake vato, head honcho

[Smack calls time]

[Round 2: Hollow Da Don]
Shut the fuck up you fuck nigga!
You only lace up your blue Chucks nigga to drive a school bus nigga, you fucked nigga!
Fuck you, fuck them and fuck y'all league
Fuck Ray Swag and fuck all y'all families y'all tryin' to feed
I know you gon' say "Fuck Lennon" so fuck Kailie
Hey baby
Fuck you, fuck daddy and fuck mommy
Fuck the baby sitter, fuck the neighbors nigga, fuck the kids she cool wit'
And fuck whoever thinkin', "Didn't Jae Millz do this?"
Fuck y'all
Fuck them
You know why? Y'all let him rap about cartoons to talk about how his trigger blam
"You'll get fried like Robot Chicken, I'm always with the can-"
Nigga high schoolers and immature adults are your biggest fans
You're fairy tale, Neverland, your rhyme books the concession stand
For what your brain storm, you won't rain (reign) long I'm the weatherman
He propose to never leave the ring but came back because he couldn't get a band
And had me pissed, wouldn't hit his stand
Shootin', with two arms crossed I'm a Reggie fan
He pulled out his fifth and maaaan
He's square with the can', you don't get the message? This nigga's spam
That means Arsonal is pork, he's just talkin' just to talk
Have him runnin' back to his corner like, "He hit harder than we thought!"
Nigga I really should hate you cause you never paid me that five homie
I mean I could've put you in a state you ain't familiar wit' so why owe me (Wyoming)?
But of course he lied and said I owed them, you know he switched it
Since he trickin', now I need money off your shows and money off your clothes cause this shit will make you 360
Speakin' of sixty that's how many people him and Lux handed in
You should've called the show off, maybe called it "Hollow"
Not because it was empty cause maybe it could've sold more
He said, "Fetty Wap is comin', Fetty Wap is comin'."
And he did but he left cause he was mad bored
Sittin' in there like an optimist, just lookin' at it half full
I mean, he tried to be a pessimist
But knew he was frontin' like a boss once he seen what the reception is
Wait, here's another bar before I let you run wild
POW!
Now he deader than a UDubb crowd
WOOOW!
I said I got the gloves on like it's Anthrax
Mask on like it's hazmat
If you don't outlast then it's Outkast: Bombs Over Baghdad

{Arsonal pushes Hollow off of him and a scuffle ensues for just under three minutes}

[Charlie Clips]
Me and Goodz mom argue like this all the time!

[Hollow Da Don]
Look, at first when they screamed "Free Hollow" I used to be glad
But now that shit got me mad, mad
Cause if I give out to a school on Wednesday then Kunta Kinte I get backlash
My last battle they barely applaud for me
I still rocked out no matter the terms and conditions, I'm sure we all agree
I mean I had the 'fro poppin' like Apollo Creed, Hollow get what Hollow need
At this point I'm more Lauryn Hill/Keanu Reeves
I know y'all thinkin', Miseducation and prolly Speed
I'm talkin' standin' up for what you believe over corporate greed
See Total Slaughter, you thought that was all for me?
You was only gettin' tossed a G
I stood up for you nigga, watch how you talk to me!
Nigga don't worry 'bout Da Don just worry what I got on
And if you ain't worried lomclothing.com

[Round 2: Arsonal]
You said, what? Crush me like pork huh?
Well I'ma crush yo' ass like pork rinds
Nigga I watched our second round at least 104 times
And I swear to God on my child I still don't understand not one of your lines
I just don't get it
If you want beef nigga, come on wit' it
Like a new neighbor, Ars' will show up to your home wit' it
Watch yo' mouth, you better change your tone wit' it
Or I'ma fuck yo' wife, long dick style and say Tyrone did it
I clap hammers, I had niggas lookin' like tap dancers
How many battles you got nigga? We rarely see you like black Santa
You just a light skinned, nappy head, house nigga wit' bad answers
Who think he that nigga cause he finally took his family to see Black Panther
You too platonic, the shit I think about is too demonic
This .40 hear that bang, it was never part of the Supersonics
I'm nice wit' my hands, so Knuckles was who I choose in Sonic
Dick too big for a condom, told your bitch to let me use her bonnet
Truth be told, you are horrible on a beat nigga
Battle rap will be your spot forever
Why you the only top tier without a Hot 97 freestyle?
Cause Flex don't want no accapella

{six seconds of silence}

[Hollow]
Are you chokin'?

[Arsonal]
No I'm not!

[Hollow]
Okay, c'mon

[Arsonal]
He'll say fuck his own people like Math cause them Canadians givin' gwap forever
What I'm sayin' is he'll be disloyal as long as it ain't American cheese, he'd rather mozzerella
Fast talkin' New Yorkers, we all know y'all chat
You told the cops what? Nigga I ain't know you know all that
The street codes will never hold y'all back
Cause you will wake up and see a star in the mirror, right?
Well that's how I know y'all rats
Cause if you put the word "star" in the mirror that's gon' blow y'all back
Think about it, look at it from a different perspective then I'll go off that
You told Math it was business, but we know all that
But when did loyalty have boundaries, tell him to show y'all that
Or I'll catch him in the retail line, I'll walk up on him
I won't kill him, I'll just steal him, that's Eziel crime
Bitch nigga tendencies, you thinkin' with a female mind
This nigga still ain't recover from that Tay Roc seat belt line
Nigga I ain't gotta make up no fake personals for you, cause you loyal
And you told Math, "I'ma bring Dizaster here for you."
Cause you loyal
Wrong
Fucked up part about it is, you act like you really loyal
But now the nigga closest to you can't trust you, you Billy Hoyle
And White Men Can't Jump, nigga
So why you slave for them crackers?
You left him in the dark, you ignored his call for days for them crackers
You really went to Boston and stood on stage for them crackers
And ain't tell yo' right hand man you was battlin' his enemy, why?
Cause you was gettin' paid by them crackers
So when you scream, "Loyalty Over Money", nigga we know you're bluffin'
Math thought you was a nigga you could lean on
Come to find out you was just some Robitussin
So disgustin', I'll punch you in your face and have your shoulder's touchin'
You've got all this drive but ain't takin' your niggas nowhere
You gotta show for (chauffeur) for somethin', now let that sink in
Before you take a dive off the deep end
You look like the type of nigga Monday through Wednesday, you only listen to The Weeknd
You battlin' a real shark dressed in sheepskin
Nigga, a shark I'll pull yo' ass under that water soon as you peek in
You better think about the consequences before you do the score all foolish boy
You think Meek would've popped that wheelie if he knew it'd get him 2-4?
You think Tee Grizzley if he knew he was gonna get caught he would've went inside that jewelry store?

{Smack calls time}

[Round 3: Hollow Da Don]
I said, is you from the Nolia then?
Chance of winning for the soldiers (Soulja), Slimm
Plus the drive thru closed and I gotta eat so I'm goin' in
You Shaq cause you could drop a 30 but at the lines you be 0 for 10
And that's like puttin' Kobe in...an open gym
To say you know it all is to know nothin', that's what I believe
Why you lookin' at me like I'm from overseas?
You don't know philosophies?
It's crazy how I'm kickin' it puttin' Arsonal (Arsenal) on Socrates (soccer tees)
That's cause when it comes to substance my nigga it's a disconnect
Cause all of this disrespect don't get respect
When you 30 plus and a legend you gotta give 'em intellect
He be like, "Your common sense is yo' consequence and yo' compliments is a con-" save that shit for Rex
I'm talkin' get direct like didn't you and your baby moms break up?
Ain't irony a bitch?
This nigga done rapped about everybody kids now he gotta get permission to see his
Look, I ain't rebuttal yet so here's a rebuttal I'ma creep in
I mean you ain't showed your boo love but showed your Crew Love now you only see her on the weekend (Weeknd)
But fuck that stereotype cause that ain't even what I'ma diss him 'bout
And give credit to a crooked ass child support system and give them clout
Cause if I ever feel suicidal I ain't put one in my scalp
I'm runnin' a medicinal buildin' and takin' niggas out
But you a coward so you gon' die like this
Nigga I'm a man I'ma die like this!
Knowin' I ain't ever live a lie or ride no dick
Wait, wait, nigga you ain't dark, you dim
You step in a room you could set a mood
I think when God invented you he accidentally tinted you
But fuck that stereotype cause black is beautiful whether dark or light skinneded
You was callin' all these crackers, right?
Well judgin' from your ring card girls and that joint you had in London
You been creepin' on your black queen with these white bitches
Bro, I seen the joint he had in London, I did the Home Alone
That bitch had on Daisy Dukes and was built like Post Malone
Look, and this ain't me snitchin' on him cause his ho is gone
But I guess it is foul since I'm hittin' so close to home
It be the most racist niggas that's a hypocrite
That's why the people not witchu
A bunch of views on WorldStar, how he get 'em?
Rappin' 'bout that Mike Brown issue
I look closer at the card and the video and that's the reason I can't rock witchu
You had the nerve to do that motherfuckin' freestyle while you had a cop witchu
L-Wisdom, that's one third of your league owners
Nigga don't make a face
One third of your league owners is a cop, right? And he actin' like it's all goodie
I ain't gon' lie they had me shook for that Lux battle when he said he was gon' book me
But look, that's another stereotype and personals and gossip that's facts, nigga
I remember the gold ole days of battle rap when it was about who could rap better
Well I spit ill, I'm sick they beggin' me to get well
While he gassed up on cloud 9 not knowin' it's a chem trail
Nigga talkin' 'bout he got the gun out the coat
You don't want no drama, where's that gun out that coat when they ran you out of Florida?
No comment, where's that gun out the coat when they ran you out Detroit?
No comment
Nigga ran twice we ain't see no gun out that old bomber (Obama)
{Hollow gets cut off by Arsonal}

[Round 3: Arsonal]
I said, you gon' have to walk a mile or two
With 50 pound weights tied to you and come back doin' Street Fighter moves I ain't never seen Guile or Ryu do
Fuck a hollow, I'ma use bald heads they look like Caillou do
Whoo I'ma strangle this nigga I just need somethin' to tie him to
I'll front page ya, GoFundMe will have to come save ya
Fuck a donation, enjoy the blade I cut him with, that's my front razor
I feel like Rambo, I got a strap in each hand I look like drum major
For the rest of this battle, all disrespect, I'ma do y'all this one favor
Now you a father figure, right?
You supposed to be teachin' your son about bein' a black minor
And it's really ironic that his father's so nice off the tongue wit' it but his mother suck dick like Blac Chyna
She got a fat pussy, she'll get her camel clutched, I'll turn into Scott Steiner
That bitch disappeared now the whole Neighborhood Watch and the cops tryin' to find her
No more locked doors, no more pickin' the doors, I'ma ring the doorbell and wait til you come down
As soon as you answer, I'ma bypass you and go knock your son down
That was the setup, cause I know your reaction gon' be to run down
As soon as you do I'ma see if this Hollow can survive this hollow for one round
They want that old Ars', dingy white T before the gold Ars'
Short tred, Carhartt, kill a nigga so Ars'
You told Tay Roc keep that same 2K energy, right?
Well that's somethin' you couldn't have told Ars'
Cause I'm not a creative player and these niggas will not control Ars'
That's why you hate me, right?
Ya bitch juggle balls looks like she's shakin' dice
Machete make her slice, hand on the ox tail (oxtail) no Jamaican rice
Ain't nobody see shit, whatever happens here stays here; Vegas nights
Man you'll lie about everything, ain't you about 30 stories up? Thought you was afraid of heights
All you do is jumble liar (jambalaya); think Cajun rice
Your Chin will have a strap on it, think Asian dykes
My gun wasn't made for a southpaw, I had to raise him right
They gon' think you into teeth whitenin', why I buy your teeth a blue laser light
Now I wanna know somethin', is you tryin' to battle me or teach a class?
Cause I'm honestly only interested in learnin' why you let John John beat yo' ass
I don't care if it's Hollow Da Don, the Dininnon or Don Lennon
Cause if y'all really had to scrap for the name then John winnin'
Fuck the contract, they already paid me I'm makin' contact
Whoo, this combat
Oh my God your body crown ain't increasin' just like Lebron stats

[Hollow]
Are you chokin' again?

[Arsonal]
No! No! I'm not chokin' again
I told you last night in the fuckin' face off you can't fight
Must I remind that? That's why this whole battle you was lookin' over your shoulder like, "Where John at?"
Now look, yeah, you better respect this savage
If not then the rest is tragic
Barrel to your pupil, I make it to where you can literally inspect the (Inspector) Gadget
C'mon son, you a hypocrite, leadin' the blind off a cliff
And your method's garbage
You a dirty dumb nigga that look smart; K-Shine in that professor jacket
You gon' think this arthroscopic surgery, all knee shots
I see cops, I'm still shootin' broad day while the police watch
I don't give a fuck about nothin', while they watch
And I'm not apologizin' for shit that I say, bitch I ain't T-Top
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
Your bitch deep throat she long winded
