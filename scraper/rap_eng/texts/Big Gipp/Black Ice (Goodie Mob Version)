[Intro: Khujo Goodie]
And we gon' creep in
We gon' hit all the hemispheres
Bottom Dirty South, yeah

[Verse 1: Khujo Goodie]
Caution, track slippery
The gangsta hippie, damn skippy
Went in your face like this choke sammich
Suckers, getting hit for losses
Not even makin' it back, to the line of scrimmage
Seasonal scrubs out, starters in
Midnight Madness, jumpin' unis from A to Z
Bustas get blocked
For sinning papers, word is bogus
Freeloaders get dropped off, pay docked
Rollers, wanna be callin' shots
Non-believers hot, under the collar
Goodie MO-B, two dope boys, and Mister C
Generatin' dolllars
We don't lead to be followed
I'll holler

[Hook]
Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high

[Verse 2: T-Mo]
Um, yeah, uh
I'm in the clouds, the dark, my planes racin' cross the sky
No haters on players, although they passin' us by
Fly like a bird, with no destination
Makin' a manifestation through music, bruh
Use this as a way of expression, you in a cold world
Chasin' herb, clockin' a G
Use them G's to invest
Sub-Zero degrees, makin' invincible slip
Trip and nickin' the wounds
It was a hard fall to your doom

[Hook]
Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high (Sky high)
Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high (Sky high)

[Verse 3: Cee-Lo]
Whenever we endeavor, we capture compassion collage
Cleverly they'll never be
Binding for finding that forever free
Naturally, actually, I master me classically
The raspy raps touch the trees and traps
And, oh, believe me, shorty snaps when his lungs collapse
My aunt is scratchin' for the scraps
Wanna love you but I can't, 'cause you eatin' and I ain't
The sinner, the saint

Sky high (Repeat 10X)

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Now who done stepped in?
The nigga the B-I-G, the secret weapon, boy
Slicker that black ice, throwing these flows like rice at weddings
So quick flexing, you speaking about somethin' that's refreshing
To the earlobes; pay for the room and still be in pimp mode
Like Iceberg, Chryslers and Buicks
Some niggas ain't on their jobs, so them suckers seem to lose it
Abuse their privileges and now their whole village's been shot to pieces
'Cause niggas are biting that same stupid shit, I mean, that feces
Boy, don't beep me if you ain't got no work
I'm strictly about these verses like the ones you hear at church, boy
Search boy, talking about your dough is long like Lurch, boy
Every time I heard you rhyming like a fucking jerk boy, simp
Yeah!

[Verse 5: Andre 3000]
Friends, Romans, countrymen lend me you eardrums
It was a beautiful day off in the neighborhood
Yellows and greens and blues and browns
And greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated wood
Ain't a thing could explain but what pertains
To cocaine and sustaining reign
See summer rolls around, niggas all about change
Then they steady move them keys like Bob James
'Cause old man winter's arrived, the temperature dives
November just died, December's alive
Thus it ain't no typical ride
Just individual way to bring home
The bacon when bacon was all gone
Making it our own, taking me all wrong
We've all indulged in a bulge of those no-nos
No, you ain't solo, there's even lower levels you can go
Take sun people put 'em in a land of snow

[Hook]
Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high

[Verse 6: Big Gipp]
Yeah
If it don't bump off in the club, it don't hit
If you can't get down with D Wayne, we got crip
Never liked short cars in my life, I drove ships
Been gone for three years but we back like crimps
For them boys with the deep dish dicks
White walls thick, didn't have to change much
Didn't have to fix shit, so
Man, make the mothafucka speaker blow, shake the fuckin' flo'
Here to let your ass know
One more time on the grind, didn't have to think twice
When I'm in the streets, always lookin' out for the black ice
Always lookin' out for the black ice

[Hook]
Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high
Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high
