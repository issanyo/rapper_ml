INTRO [Witchdoctor]
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh
This thing is serious
This thing is serious

CHORUS
This is for my folk down in
Them creeks (dah Witch Doctor in the house)
This is for my folk down in
Them creeks
And I gotta compliment Gipp
He told me to talk yall back, uh

[VERSE 1: Witchdoctor]
When we was kids, I was into french kissin’
And then they imposed a curfew
Atlanta kids missin’, uh
We was them kids, now we grown
I’m hip to every evil plot you wanna put on
And we bring you back to this real
Cause some of these kids’ families
They still live drippin’ with tears
I’m saying smile if you can
Cause the law gone let kidnappers
Get the last hand
You should get the shivers
Every time you pass the Chattahoochee River
Oh yeah wreck, yeah, ya trying to kill off
What race and use a nut case with a bust face
Eh Kluke and Klan was all right
But I had to bust Kluck
I know he dealing with Wayne when he got stuck
I know I know Kluck was dealing with Wayne
When he got stuck

CHORUS
This is for my folk down in (yeah, yeah)
Them creeks
This is for my folk down in
Them creeks

[VERSE 2: Big Gipp]
For goodness sake, people the watch, simp these was set
For the second notes on the clock, Gipp
Bigger than a name
Hannibal is a fictional character with living proof
The serial brilliance, emanates through the post of a
Middle age, withdrawn, seashell mell
Hell green river killer, angel of the railroad
Aside from Bundy and John Wayne Gasey
My daddy Willie Jo said he knew
One of the kids that the Boogie Man
Marred off the corner of Ashby, catastrophe
Like a roof 19 GTO to the door
Could you take if your baby-momma was shot
5 times in the gut
We identify with dead bodies, that’s floaters
Like documented through time, vase and photos
The house should told us
The streets and the parks ain’t good for everybody, ya know?

CHORUS
This is for my folk down in
In them creeks
This is for my folk down in
In them creeks

[VERSE 3: Big Gipp]
Edward Swift, Alfred Evans, they were the first two
Eddie Duncan was the kid that my family knew
His body found on March 31st
Blessed be the man who walked with a curse
Latonya gone from her home
Mr Wayne helped put adolescent faces
On the 2% milk boxes when it was cool
Before plastic had a chance, from a glance
You can hear my stance, some off the porch
Camp Creek, the crawfish sleep, the bed bugs play like
Fuzz and keep ya pinching, ya always get close to the rim
But won’t flow over for ever inching, needing extension
After extension. Abnormal is normal for some
So when the car pulls up to the curb
Gipp was taught to run
So fallin’ for a panty trick
Or being a random pick in the hands
Of a predator, mentor, never

CHORUS
This is for my folk down in
In them creeks
This is for my folk down in
In them creeks
This is for my folk down in
In them creeks
This is for my folk down in
In them creeks
