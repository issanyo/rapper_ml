[Intro: Mani Coolin']
This that shit that make you wanna dance, yeah
This that shit that make you wanna dance, yeah
Clap yo hands, yeah, clap yo hands, yeah
This yo (ah), this yo (ah), this yo (ah), this yo (ah)

[Verse 1: Mani Coolin']
This yo jam, you ain't even know it
Pill in your drink, you ain't even notice
It don't even matter, it just add to the potion
Once you hit the floor, then you feel the motion
You on the floor dancing, romancing
Any man tryna get up in your pant
You the type of bitch to play hard to get
On the Gram posted like you a model in your pics
You ain't never model shit
Yeah, you kinda cute, but shallow stupid
When you strive like me you can probably be something, but you not (you not shit)
So tell me what it is, don't lie to me
If I pull up in a Benz, you gon' slide me
If I pull up to the club, we get in for free
I don't pull up to the club for no other reason girl
Like, yeah, we just different
Pull up, ceiling missing
Pull up, bitch just get in
Don't be asking to many questions
I be Coolin' don't need no extra
I be moving in different direction
Speeding through these intersections
You think I'm crazy? We all kinda crazy

[Pre-Hook]
Headed straight to VIP
Stepped in the club, had three, four, five girls with me
And they all ready (they all ready)
Now they say they wanna drink like me
Straight to the dance flo', let's get more liqour
Now we flexin', she gon' let me hit

[Hook]
Get your jam on, get your hands up
Get your, get your jam on
Aye, this your jam, huh?
Aye, this your, ain't this your jam, huh?
Get your jam on, get your hands up
Get your, get your jam on
Aye, this your jam, huh?
Aye, this your, ain't this your jam, huh?

[Verse 2: League]
Man, I ain't never been so ready
Tell these niggas put me in the game already
Just let me get off, I can probably run and get a hit off
She coming to the crib to take her shit off
She tryna run it back, I'm finna kick off
You know we in, I'm finna lift off
Mommy is a nook, she dropped her kid off
Ain't fucking with her daddy that she live off
I'm finna bust it open, take the lid off
4:05 when we get off, I can't even make it to the crib
I think she want me hit it in the whip
I think she like it better when we dip
She get a little wetter when we sip
Is that her man? Took you for ransom
She got her hands up 'cause this her jam, huh
Cause this your jam, huh

[Hook]
Get your jam on, get your hands up
Get your, get your jam on
Aye, this your jam, huh?
Aye, this your, ain't this your jam, huh?
Get your jam on, get your hands up
Get your, get your jam on
Aye, this your jam, huh?
Aye, this your, ain't this your jam, huh?

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
Is this her jam, this her jam?
This her jam, huh
Is that her man? Is that her man?
Not for long, huh
She a rich girl, with a couple of mil's she a rich girl
Drill music, no pitchers
Got my mind on her and her body too
Money makes the world go round, yes it do
Looking like me and you
Did my research, did my recon, this the season
Flip the page, knew you was mine the very first day
Touchy, flower, bouquet
I say, "how the story going"
"He so cool, but he so boring
Leave with me and we go touring
Country club and state to state
Took too long, I'ma snatch the plate
We don't need eyes, we in love in blind
On the highway we smoking gas
Her hand on my stick, my hand on her ass

[Hook]
Get your jam on, get your hands up
Get your, get your jam on
Aye, this your jam, huh?
Aye, this your, ain't this your jam, huh?
Get your jam on, get your hands up
Get your, get your jam on
Aye, this your jam, huh?
Aye, this your, ain't this your jam, huh?
