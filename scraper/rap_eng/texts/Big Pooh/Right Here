[Intro] [Big Pooh]
Uh, Illmind, Median, Rapper Pooh, Phonte
I know y'all been waitin' a long time for this man. Here we, go

[Verse One] [Big Pooh]
This here, it had to be expected
Pooh attack mics like a can of disinfectant
My drive has been resurrected
With this ill shit that Illmind injected
This game is about to get hectic
LB is here you must accept it
Cause too often, people try to sleep on the kid
I'm sick with it, can't you hear the paper coughin'?
Hot nigga like I'm walkin' down Slauson
Middle of the day, no shade, people pausin'
Rubber neckin', Uy's in the street on my feet
West coast is ready to overdose this
Hocus pocus that we call music
And y'all niggas can quote this
I wrote this on a sunny afternoon
Laid back in my room, y'all niggas can hold this, uh

[Hook] [Phonte]
So loud so clear
Ain't no better place than right here (right here)
Say yeah (awe yeah)
Cause ain't no better space and ain't no better place than right here
Let the people say
[Big Pooh]
So loud so clear
Ain't no better place than right here (right here)
Say yeah (awe yeah)
Cause ain't no better space and ain't no better place than right here

Let the people say

[Verse Two] [Phonte]
Check it out, uh
Still gettin' it
Still got work to do, without no fringe benefits
And sayin', "Phonte ain't rippin' it"
That's oxymoronic like Icy Hot or ABB Distributing
I mean, it's taken me a little bit to get my life in my rhymes
Now everybody wonder how
The Phonte, Big Tay and 9th Wonder sound
Got that cause we got on tracks but ain't give 'em the run around
Very respectable
Made y'all raise the decibels
At a time when hip hop was so destitute
Now everybody claimin' that they gonna spark it
Tryin' play Gregory Hines and Tap into this market
And the thought is so sickenin'
Cause them rhymes stored in they memory banks just ain't holdin' no interest
But I go with my feelin'
And even if I had to go independent
Tay still gonna flow with a vengeance
You better tell 'em

[Hook]

[Phonte singing]
There's no place I'd rather be

[Verse Three] [Median]
Ayo, Median is out the box
What a fox here
Flier than a seagull, we gone with the wind
Crews doomed to lose, we was born to win
The League's so official so I run with them
Shout out to pioneers that paved the wiggy
Paid the jiggy
Engraved their name upon the city
I embrace my cultures fame so committed to this
It's hip hop idish
I was born to live it
Engulfed to abyss, so deeply I'm short winded
The art is my action
Syllables are friction
Others use words to speak, it's much bigger
My pattern of speech is relief to the listener
My swagger in my speech I release to deliver
Them sunbeams that visit me from the above sender
Couldn't fathom a breach with a gift such as this one
Gotta gather my speech to complete the mission

[Hook]
