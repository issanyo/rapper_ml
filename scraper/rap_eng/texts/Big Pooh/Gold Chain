[Hook]
I used to wanna rock a gold chain
A bracelet with two pinky rings
I got a couple carat earrings
And I don't even wear the damn things

[Verse 1]
I used to want Gucci, used to want Prada
Used to want a Audi 5000, [?] bruh
I thought getting it was stuntin'
I used to think getting it was frontin'
Cubic zirconia until I got something
Uh oh! Here comes that rap check
Take me to the store, I need a Rolex
No, take me to the car lot, I want a Lex
Driving 'round slow, this is success
Look at all these girls looking impressed
Yes! I'm in the money G
Now watch them [?] no money tree

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I used to want a Rollie instead I bought a Lexus
Now I got women rubbing on my solar plexus
They wanna know where that money at
But tell me would you love me in a Pontiac
Now watch 'em scatter like roaches
Got tired of dealing with them vultures
Tryna stick it up like a poster
[Snoop?] say ain't no love for them hoes bruh

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I had to figure out who I was
Who I ain't, I ain't in clubs
I ain't concerned with looking nigga rich
All on your television looking niggerish
Rah rah, rah rah rah, rah
Or blah blah, blah blah blah, blah
Nor always talking 'bout what I got
'Cause I know them wolf niggas keep a plot
That's how you get got
Think on it
Gold Chain bitch
