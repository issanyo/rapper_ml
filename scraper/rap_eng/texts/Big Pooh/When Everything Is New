[Hook: Phonte]
When everything is young, fresh, and neeeeeeeeeeww...
When everything is young, fresh, and neeeeeeeeeeww...Ooh-ooh..

[Interlude: Phonte]
(Well)
Another morning, (wake up wake up) as the night fades away
I wish she would stay for awhiiiile (for awhiiiile)
Another warning, (wake up wake up) not to waste all our daaays (waste all our days)
So let's greet today with a smile (Smiii-iiii-iii-iile...)

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Uh, I know it sounds like an endin, this is a beginning
The wheels keep spinnin on a brand new thought
And people all the time sayin Rapper Pooh ought
To go back to school, stop playin cool
We'll stop by the pool, no shame belly showin
Hate motivate last time to keep flowin
That was last time I evolved as a man
And as I got older I begin to understand
That dreams do change, goals rearranged
It's no longer fame I aspire to attain
Cause fame is a drain where your morals get flushed
Values get crushed and we no longer trust
What got us here in the first place, for me it only takes one case
The verdict's been read, these words been said now I K-I-M
It's plenty people left who believin in them (WORD?)
And this here's the next chapter in my life
An ongoing saga I decided to write
I decided it's right, you decide if you like
You decide that you like, God bless and goodnight!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Uh..uh..uh!
Peace to my nigga Jozeemo
And we gon +Keep it Movin+ like Soul II Soul
Tay raps is the coldest, even though I feel
Like the oldest twenty-eight year old I know
Remember back in the days on the GTA
When me and Aunt Gilles used the bus pass
Now I go out on the road, come home see my kids like
"Damn nigga, when you get a moustache?"
In '98, lost my stepfather, around the same time that I met my partner
Goin round campus as the shit starters
God damn! Time passes like Brett Favre
And if you try to catch up, then don't even bother
That's why I can't do the shit I usta do no mo'
This world'll try to break you with lies and fables
Make you not even believe in you no mo'
Had to get back to me, get back to mines
Get back to fam, get back to rhymes
Lay down at night and say without shame
Today I was a man, tomorrow I'll be the same
Be a bonfire when others are just a flame
Be a memory when others are just a name..
That's real words from a true heart
You can take it as a old ending or a new start
..Whatchu thought, UH!

[Phonte - singing interlude]
Feel brand neeeeeeeww..
And I'm just so happy to say..
Feel brand neeeeeeeww..
Just so happy to seeeeeee..
Feel brand neeeeeeeww..
Embrace another day to see the sun, brand neeeeeeeww..

Uh..eh-heh..it's bout to be Friday morning joint, dawg
One more time, yeah..
