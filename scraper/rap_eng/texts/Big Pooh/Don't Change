[Verse 1]
People keep asking me when Sleepers 2 coming out
I say never, thanks for looking out
Don't you hear this music that I'm putting out?
If I had to say so, say I'm getting better, you know?
I'm hotter than a sweater
On a girl on the beach in the middle of the summer
Sipping balimis peach
Me and DR had a talk
I asked him what I'm gon' do "preach"
It ain't like I went gold
Even LB barely did a hundred
So let me find out
All along that the old me is what you niggas really wanted
I appreciate the compliment
But when you gon' appreciate accomplishments
Eventually we all grow
So me going forward shouldn't be no astonishment

[Hook x4]
Don't change, don't change

[Verse 2]
People keep asking me when LB coming back
I say we not, and this is fact
Why you clinging to the past?
I been moved on, blazing another path
Why I'm flattered by the questionnaire
If that's the only reason why you came here
Then you might as well go
This channel been changed homie this another show
I'm doing this for me now
I'm curious to see how
Many people still listening or giving him a fair shake
Remember him?
It was what it was
The music speaks, it does what it does
You fucking with me or not
I appreciate your time, either way it's all love

[Hook x4]
