[Intro]
"Keep it locked inside, keep it just between us
Keep it secret, never confide, until they all have seen us"

Yeah, smoke something
Drink something, zone out
("One two")

[Verse 1]
Zone out, ain't no need to pull a chrome out
Unless we talking 'bout them wheels, homie roll up
You see 'em checking out the whip, let me slow up
Ey that's my nigga over there, better throw it up
R.I.P. to dead homies so I pour it up
See me in some new shit, keep 'em throwing up
So what I ain't the best by your best standard
Still living my life just how I planned it
Still rough around the edges, fuck 'em, why sand it?
Like to stick 'em in they sides 'til they can't stand it
Don't respond to wannabees, you can all can it
In the net, like the flames so they try to fan it
This is more candid, liver than the interviews
Other people spin your words like a centrifuge
I ain't into feuds, or a rap beef
These ain't your real friends, nigga they just showing teeth

[Hook]
{"One two"}
{"Puff the lah, relaxin"}
{"You gots to chill"}
{"Slow down"}

[Verse 2]
Kick back, put my feet up on the glass table
Lil' liquor in the cup, watch a lil' cable
Watching people get jobs and they ain't able
To perform cause they really ain't qualified
Black people got a proplem, we don't swallow pride
Forget asking for ya help, yo we rather slide
Backslide, now we out showing our backside
Backed us into a corner that we try and hide
It's the beats and these words which I confide
Let the rhythm of my voice take me for a ride
And zone out, ain't no need to pull a chrome out
Unless we talking 'bout them wheels, time to roll out
And if your credit like mine, pull a fold out
You in the back of the line, we been sold out
Nobody got enough talent to be a hold-out
And if the pressure too much, go another route

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Zone out, ain't no need to pull a chrome out
Unless we talking 'bout them wheels, seat lean back
Lil' space between the wheels, yeah I need that
I see 'em laughing at the car, pointing, "He's fat"
Well you're right, say it twice, yeah I need that
Just a lil' inspiration and you feed that
Morning sign been posted, better heed that
Trying to follow the lead, check where we at

[Hook]
