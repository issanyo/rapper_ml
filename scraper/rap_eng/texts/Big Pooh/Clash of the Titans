[V-Stylez]
MoSS, I'm..
The wrong type of cat, gritty nigga and I'm evil
Out for the presents, sneaky dude, call me Smeagol
Lord of the ring and when the bell go "ding"
Jabs looking very sharp, punches hard and clean
You never land, I'm too elusive for your amateur game
Spit it well, you didn't know? You better check my name
V-Style, get it right and I rep the D
Where everybody hood hard, yo I just emcee
It don't matter if you big or tall or who the shortest
Just show me where the challenge is at, call your florist
Cause I'mma John Wayne on your ass, that's true grit
Talk slick and I would damage your top, wig split
D-X on muh'fuckers, silly dudes can +Suck It!+
Take my twins from my waste, blast my Kirby Pucketts
Yo my brain propane, gas turn into flame
Straight fire when ignited, break you down to the grain

[Royce Da 5'9"]
G shit, we sick, we spit, fuck you
Pay me, fuck all that free shit, eat dick
Crew shining like shit, we split, she strip
We tip, blue diamonds got mammy all seasick
Now take a brief sit, here's a handkerchief tip
While I fall on the floor, 'nuff money for a cheap trip
Huh, bitch, now who I'm finna leave with?
Find a friend and come, who you wanna get on your knees with?
My jewellery sick, I got a disease on my wrist
My neck and the shit's making me freeze bit
Breeze in with my Angela Jolie bitch
She lick my underarms, you can call me B. Pitt
Any problems nigga, we fix, my bitch
Will hit you, be like boiling water nigga she slick
That's a trip, saying he slip
Always on point, like a Christmas tree tip, creep up and eat clips

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Aiyyo, I know you like how Rapper C is waiting
Cause D niggas recognize thee nigga waiting
Rapper remain patient, took jabs like a champ now
Every verse out need the Rapper Pooh stamp
I tramp on foes, face down for them hoes
Pity the fool, any fool likely to oppose
See right through them clothes and your real nigga pose
Real niggas won't say a word, case closed
Blessed with the pen game, take aim
Maimed your career off of this strain, the disdain
All on your face mayne, it's plain with no competition
Me and you in the same breath, don't mention
This is my position right now in the future
Sewing up careers like some well-done sutures
These are maneuvers, up the ladder I ascend
Clash of the titans, nigga fuck a new trend

[Elzhi]
This nigga biting while I'm thinking, writing, to get the ink ignited
So when he move it's like a streak of lightning
Fuck where the crowns at, this brown cat could leave the town flat
And beat you like the part of the speaker you pump the sound at
I'm not stopping the slot topping, so when I plot
Dropping something hot, you copped it, it got popped in
Vultures better duck, flows with lead is tucking
Expose the feather ducking, blows your head to chunks
Rip flyer before I dip, be quick, hip fire
Slip by you a line that goes off like a trip wire
I'm from the sickest city, your whole clique is kiddy
If your chick is pretty, she'll suck a dick, I'll lick the titties
Your type of rhyming got me bored but I'm a star
The kind that you found where the comics are, knock you off your feet
Fussing, I eat dozen, I move the streets, trusting
In some sweet crushing petite Russians, skeet bussing
Screaming like they bout to meet Justin
Timberlake, I tremor quakes, hemmers shake
I'm the one with the gems and cake, extra smokes
And skinny dips like naked folks in swimming lakes

[Phat Kat]
Around the world my fans know me for the flows I bust
The Polo I rock and hoes I crushed
And the sound of my voice turn haters to dust
But still making funky music is a must
The newest star in Catacombs giving haters the flux
I switched it, bounced it, upgrade to super-deluxe
My whole crew is dangerous, ain't no taming us
The fast get wound on point, the finger's blaming us
Simply, oh, oh, it's the year of the emcee
We're here to fill the void, the game been running on empty
Had a long day nigga so please don't tempt me
Cooked so much beef but my name ain't Wimpy
Bout to snatch all your customs, your bag's too skimpy
And my shit sound fresh when this the voice in this empty
Tongue's so sharp, I chop you niggas down to mincemeat
So fuck your money, jewels and cars, using it as camouflage
Need to focus on planning the strength in your bars
It's Phat Kat the living legend, still counting my funds
Because I never kissed no ass, I stuck to my guns
While you're still coming up short, Kat holding the fort
Dedicate this to my fans, thanks for all your support
Yeah, this cold steel bitches, it's how we do it and it's real bitches
Yeah, it's Ronnie Kat

[V-Stylez]
Yeah, it's your man V-Stylez
Royce 5'9", Phat Kat and Elzhi
The Rapper Big Pooh from Little Brother
And MoSS on the beat bringing the heat
It's Hip Hop, non-stop
