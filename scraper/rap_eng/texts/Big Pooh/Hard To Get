"This was my 21st birthday uh, yanahmsayin?
I was with this chick about a cool two months
You know what I'm sayin? Goin hard at her
Like REALLY y'know, throwin game at this chick
But she had a man, I really- I was runnin in place kinda sorta, y'know
We kiss and all that, y'know we'd make out
But I never could smash cause she was tryin to be faithful to her man
You know how that bullshit goes - anyway, my 21st birthday, it was a wrap
So I hit her up like, 'Wassup?! You gon' come hang with me on my 21st birthday?'
And she's on the phone soundin all sad and shit and she's like
'No.. I CAN'T!' And I'm like, 'Why? What's goin on? What's wrong?'
And she's like, 'My boyfriend got shot today!' And I just, y'know, sit there for a second
Then I go.. 'Well alright~!! Happy birthday to ME! So wassup?! You're gonna come thru or what?'
HAHAHAHA! But yeah, long story short., she never did kick it with me that day
Her boyfriend pulled through and I never did get to smash
Can't win 'em all, but yeah, that's about the funniest, craziest most fucked-up
Birthday I ever had, I feel like a pitiful person tellin this shit
But that shit was funny, brah! I was drunk man, shit happens"
