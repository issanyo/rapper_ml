[Intro]

Historical!
OK, OK, Let's try this one more 'gain
(Yessir)

[Verse 1: Stephen Redhead]

Top down, live it up, problem, I don’t give a fuck
Issues with my pockets but the drama wasn’t big enough
Some of this attention would eventually end up in some fisticuffs
Had to tell the Devil that the jig is up
Gas tank to the brim, glass plane with the tints
Double decker combo with the thin crust for the win
Last week, beat my own record by the track meet
Not bad for a young lad if you ask me
Hit ‘em with the doubles, all my niggas standing in the huddle
‘cause ain’t nobody planning for a fumble
And ain’t nobody planning a rebuttle
We detect jealously, tell ‘em leave, handle one another
Life’s about choices, you can wyle out being boisterous
I’m heading to my chick up in the Cloisters
Got the kinda poise making boys throw voices
It’s pointless, errybody know who the McCoy is

[Hook]

Riding through the city with the top down
Even tho the buildings getting knocked down
It looks bad, but we can’t stop now
It’s all so beautiful
Sundresses out cause it’s hot now
Kickin in the shade with the dark brown
Even tho that we see the cops out
It’s all so beautiful

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]

Sun still shining even though it's raining
The birds still chirping, gotta start my car
That shit ain't working, get to see the city
From a bus route, time to get paid
But the bills due, function at the crib
I hope she coming through, chicken on the grill
Bring a bottle too, everybody gone
Now I'm cleaning up, back at the job
Pissin' in a cup, but I don't smoke weed
Liquor in my cup, the only fix I need
A nine to five hustle, you can call it greed
But I want more than a picket fences
Stack a couple dollars, yeah that make sense
My girl on the line, mama on the line
They both looking for me, but I'm out of reach
Somewhere far away, but I'm right here

[Hook]

Riding through the city with the top down
Even tho the buildings getting knocked down
It looks bad, but we can’t stop now
It’s all so beautiful
Sundresses out cause it’s hot now
Kickin in the shade with the dark brown
Even tho that we see the cops out
It’s all so beautiful

[Verse 3: Stephen Redhead]

Got the world spinning on a broken axis
Dropped another classic, probably broke your bandwidth
If your neck is gonna shatter from these matters, I’ll support your casket
Just spell my name right in the pamphlet
Beating down the asphalt, tryina make the last call
Swerving through the curves like a catwalk, sheesh
We don’t write our plans or speak
Lady tryina get the code for the past 4 weeks
Rising from the storm and you beat the cycle
You see the spiral, now you’ll be the spiral
How you went to work for others feeling suicidal
Then applied it to your hustle and you meet your idols
After years of feeling stifled man I feel entitled
I don’t see no rivals, I’m too archetypal
Which means originality is king
Me and Pooh make the news while these dudes proofread, let’s go

[Hook 2x]

Riding through the city with the top down
Even tho the buildings getting knocked down
It looks bad, but we can’t stop now
It’s all so beautiful
Sundresses out cause it’s hot now
Kickin in the shade with the dark brown
Even tho that we see the cops out
It’s all so beautiful
