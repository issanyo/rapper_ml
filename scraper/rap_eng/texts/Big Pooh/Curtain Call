Yo, yeah, huh, it's Phontigga
You know I been doing my thing
Foreign Exchange things, y'knahmsayin?
All kind of things
Then you got my brother Big Pooh
He doing his things, Dirty Pretty Things
A whole bunch of things
We gon' do this thing one last time man
It's Little Brother

Aiyyo, automatic, systematic, me and my nigga at it
Last go round for the pound, get your Instamatics
With all the pictures added, we put our stamp on it
Not being Cam'Ronish, I mean +Diplomatic+
I say what I feel till I ain't gotta say no more
I dedicate this to the A&Rs
That said LB is the game but they ain't playing ball
And all the turncoat niggas who forgot what we was playing for
So you can call this the day tomorrow
It's the removal of a fixture, a complicated picture
And not even Clarissa could +explain it all+
You're mad with me? Tough tittie, get a training bra
This is the marathon I have been training for
Ever since me and Big Pooh was getting rental cars
Ever since Khrysis banging out on the ASR
Never leave the game, just changed the way I play the cards

[Hook: Phonte]
Aiyyo, who them boys that make the record feel "so good"?
Turn the speakers up and let the record kill
Don't stop, you know it don't quit
But when it's curtain call, then that's all you gon' get
We do it like this, one time, make the record feel "so good"
Turn the speakers up and let the record kill
Don't stop, you know we don't quit
But when it's curtain call, then that's all you gon' get
And we do it like this

[Rapper Big Pooh]
This is it, the last monologue
Last act in the play, you can say the epilogue
New hooks to begin dear friends
You can always press rewind and relive it again
Listening in '03 made the people take notice
Shout to Beni B even though shit was bogus
Toured around the world, came home, new deal
Chittlin Circuit out, thank Koch for the meal
Minstrel Show here looking for mass appeal
Guess they wasn't ready for the real on the reel
It did what it did, know them boys bounced back
Hit drawn with a car, Gangsta Grillz got that
Boogie came through before Getback dropped
Three became two but the party ain't stop
Before the curtain close, before the music ends
Had the time of my life, let me thank you again
It's LB

Hook: Phonte

[Phonte]
Yeah, shout out to all the fans that's been supporting us from day one
Big ups to y'all
Shout out to all the brothers coming up in the game
That's continuing this tradition of what we started, carrying the torch
Big ups to my peoples Tanya Morgan, J. Cole, Jay Electronica
Pac Div what up? Drake, Wale, let's ride
