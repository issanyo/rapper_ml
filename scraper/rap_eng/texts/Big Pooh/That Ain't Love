[Intro]
Uhh, yeah, love
You know we always, we always talkin 'bout love
We always thinkin 'bout it y'know
I'm in love, I want love, I need love, whatever
But like sometimes I wonder
With all the hurt and pain that people that supposedly love you put you through
Is that really love?

[Phonte]
We would go to each other's houses, sleep on the flo'
Crash on each other's couches, work like kings and
Eat like paupers, now my heart palpitates
Just thinkin 'bout all the stress that came up out this
Started out hard, goin for the long haul
Put all of the bullshit and hoes on pause
Shit got major we, stacked a little paper now
Couple years later can't get a phone call
Hold up~! Big fish in a little pond
Swimmin 'round town, thinkin like we already stars
And they say that money change you, but money don't change you
It just make you more of what you already are
Hope our kids do better than we
Hope he and she learn to stick together when the times get ugly
I've been misconstrued, lied to and abused
But my fam still swear that they love me man

[Hook]
If this is love, I don't wanna see hate
If this is real, I don't wanna see fake - I'm sayin
Cause I don't know how much more I can take
I know that, all of y'all can relate - I'm sayin
Uhh, if this is love, I don't wanna see hate
If this is real, I don't wanna see fake
You know that ain't love love, that ain't love love
That ain't love love, that ain't love love

[Rapper Big Pooh]
You were the, right hand, my man 50 Grand
Us gettin dollars was all part of the plan
A few years back we cut ties, you understand
It was all business, nuttin person-al
And you vowed to come back a different person now
We are back on track, and time heals wounds
Nothin showed me you came back too soon
Yeah, once again you and I to the tune
We brought you on tour, put money in your fist
You fucked up plenty and got slapped on the wrist
That's it! And everytime the brothers grand mack
The topic would arise about you bein kept
The Lord says forgive I will never forget
Shoulda picked up the phone when the times got ugly
I've been misconstrued, lied to and abused
But my fam still swear that they love me man
Aww sheeit~!

[Hook]

[Jozeemo]
"I'ma ride for my niggas", I figure that's what they all say
It's foul play when cuttin throats is your forte
Do it how you wanna be done, that's what the Lord say
Daps and hugs, but turn your back and get the swordplay
I'm sure you say I got it all wrong, it ain't like that
I sent you all them letters, guess it's better you ain't write back
Despite the fact you told me plenty tears you had to fight back
All lies, surprise, I ain't diss you with no spite track
I know you'd probably like that, but never will I hit your level
You gon' dig your own grave, focus when you grip the shovel
I should be pissed as ever, but I'm the bigger brother
So I'mma keep it movin while you get your shit together
Our bonds was severed, but all you had to say was fuck me
I smelled your bullshit, consider me lucky
I've been misconstrued, lied to and abused
But my fam still swear that they love me - ain't that a bitch!
