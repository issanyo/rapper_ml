[Rapper Big Pooh]
It's Rapper, hah, listen
I mean who the fuck is you to wanna criticise me?
I never back down, I never cop pleas
Staring at a stack of these carbon copies
Niggas emulate, got me really unease
Rappers nowadays say this game is a breeze
Till you not selling records, treat you like you was disease
Straight niggas hugging on the nuts, holding your peas
The mind of these wannabe women acting B's
Nappy-headed he's, sluts for the gloss
Not that white star hypnotized by The Source
Trapped in this forest, yes the wolves begun
Picking out weapons of choice, I'm not choosing a gun
Wouldn't choose to run 'less they said it for a seat
But then you in the system and they mission complete
So I choose to speak bout what I know only
They say I'm too real, they don't wanna know homie
Master on the pole say he got something for me
Middle finger up, tell that muh'fucker blow me

You wanna be on the radio then "dumb it down"
You want ya videos played then "dumb it down"
You want another label deal better "dumb it down"
You ever want to sell a mill' better "dumb it down"
You wanna be on the radio then "dumb it down"
You want ya videos played then "dumb it down"
You want another label deal better "dumb it down"
You ever want to sell a mill' better "dumb it down"
