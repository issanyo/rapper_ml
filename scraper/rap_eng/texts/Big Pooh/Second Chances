[Intro]

Uh, uh
Keep bouncing
Uh, uh, uh
Keep bouncing
Uh, uh, uh
Keep bouncing
Uh, uh, uh
Keep bouncing


[Hook: Darien Brockington]
They say "don't give second chances"
But ain't nobody gon' make me feel like you do
And I know that this ain't perfect
But I still feel like it's worth it cause I love you


[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
All of my friends keep telling me
I need to pack it up, stay moving
I need to weigh the good and the bad
If the bad prevails then I need to stop losing
I keep choosing this pain
Saying to myself "it's only time before it all starts to change"
I ain't try to hear it so my mind rearrange
All your opinions don't constitute change
Even though we bring the worst out each other
She counter back "we the best under covers"
But under covers can't save us from
Fussing and fighting, arguing for days
I'm getting tired of this wave of emotion
Back and forth, up and down, rollercoastin'
I like when ships sail smooth in the ocean
But this a perfect storm where I don't mind motion

[Hook]

[Bridge: Bilal]
Everybody's telling me
That I should be the one
To up and walk away
From what we have together
Try to replace you baby
But I just can't leave it alone
So many may try, try to get next to me
But ain't nobody who can love me quite like you


[Verse 2: Phonte]
Uh
Nobody quite like you
Cause we go way back like Excitebike
I mean further than that, I'm talking Lite Brites
Through all the ups and downs, you were the highlight
Saturday morning, beauty parlor, getting highlights
Telling your girls I should straighten up and fly right
Cause when the times get leaner, other grass seems to have a greener hue
Look away, but don't lose sight of what I mean to you

[Hook]

[Bilal]
Ohhhh, yeah, yeah
It ain't perfect, Lord knows
It is so worth it to me


[Spoken: Phonte]
You know you used to always to tell me I was a lot different than the average nigga
And I guess that's true, cause by now the average nigga would've been done packed his shit and got the hell on
Shit, I thought about it
I could just never go through wit it though
I don't know, maybe I'm stupid feeling that way
But, you know, maybe it's something a little deeper
Like, you know what I'm saying, like yo I remember the first time, you know what I'm saying, we went out
A nigga was so broke, we used to have the $5 date nights, you remember that?
We'd get two double cheeseburgers from the dollar menu then get two tickets to the $1.50 movie
I guess it's shit like that that, you know, the average woman ain't gon' understand just from seeing a nigga in a magazine
I can't do this without you, baby

[Hook]
