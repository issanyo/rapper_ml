[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
This is dope by the caseload
Champagne popping
Plastic in the locker room
Niggas ain't stopping
Parades down Main Street
Biggie on the radio
Greatest that you ever seen or heard
But you don't hear me though
Drop top presidential
Detour residential
Extenuating circumstance making confidential
Racks of the ticker tape
Losers here to demonstrate
Pick a sign, form a line
Watch you try and keep it straight
Break through, take 2
Mind start to levitate
Nap for an hour or so
Wake up, meditate
Medicate
Heart starts to palpitate
Blood pressure fluctuate
Flour on the paper plate, Tony
20 20 inch screens watch my every move
And they watching yours too
So what's the use of being phony?
Gold nugget, no gold chain
Go David Blaine
I wonder what Ma$e saw that made him wanna change
Now

[Chorus: Quelle Chris]
See my life, highlight music
Every line, take the yellow highlight to it
Every page turned gets a four from the famous
Trying to bind this hard cover for consumption for the jaded
Now
It's written in the stars, written on the walls too
If you gonna stall, give it up now
It's bigger than the law
Blare it in the cars too
I need to slow it down
Lift it up now

[Verse 2: Quelle Chris]
Shit didn't happen overnight son
Muscled my way in
I like mines combined like muscle bound saiyans
For writing rhymes on lines in spiral bound books
To typecasting rappers
Who the fuck you think you playing bro?
Save the miscalculations for the mans bro
You really can't tell me anything I don't already know
And all your favorite rappers think I'm really dope
So people see me out and think I'm rich but bro, I'm really broke
That's 100, I could lie and tell you otherwise
And that's my humble, still look flier than most other guys
I reside
Somewhere between five star [?]
Old genius til they hanging from my old penis
And young teethers like "You got a cold flow, senior"
Heavy rain that scatter pockets of the brain
Wonder what MCA saw that made him wanna change

[Chorus]
