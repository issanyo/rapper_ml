[Verse One: Joe Scudda]
I wanna look back at my life and know that it wasn't all for nothing
Now a days, man it's all or nothing
Peace to the cats that schooled me
And "fuck you" to all the fronting cats yo, you can't fool me
I see through you
Standing in the crowd like Scudda don't move you
Fuck that man, so who you?
I do you
Real recognize real
And I'ma only tell you once, so let the skin tone fool you
Don't let your eyes be deceiving
Mess around clown, guarantee ain't nobody leaving breathing
You fucking with a young scrapper
Grown heads call it young dapper, but I'm older now, colder now
Bigger chip on my shoulder now
Feel like I had something to prove
Had a time in my life, felt like I had nothing to do
Fronting for who? My fam and my crew
No more questions unanswered cause I'ma tell ya this is something for you

[Hook]
Big Pooh: Something for who?
Joe Scudda: Something for us
Big Pooh: For the ones we trust
Joe Scudda: And for the ones we love
Big Pooh: Something for the ones we dap
Joe Scudda: And the ones we hug
Both: Fuck you
Big Pooh: Cause this is something for who?
Joe Scudda: Something for us
Big Pooh: Something for the ones we trust
Joe Scudda: And the ones we love
Big Pooh: Something for the ones we dap
Joe Scudda: And the ones we hug
Both: Fuck you
Big Pooh: Cause this is something for you
Joe Scudda: Cause this somethings for who?

[Verse Two: Big Pooh]
Yo, this PSA's in the house y'all
This dedicated to my niggas with the big cars
Seat back, act chill driving long arm
Al Green in the deck sipping Boone Farm
Onyx black silver stripe to match
Hood ornament quite the catch
Drop down with a Mercedes black leather feel hot on the flesh
They can't tell me not the best, you now rocking to it
Hip hop is something me and Scudda speak fluent
Both of us [?]
Two brains in the back, head right to it
They box me up in the corner, gotta fight through it
Rise slowing at your local spots
Beat drop gonna shake up the block
Ain't no question if you love it or not
I see the Pooh boys
You nodding too, check it out cause this something for you

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Joe Scudda]
Yo I'm here now with the jump out
This ain't a b-ball game
Where me and Pooh gon' show you what run 'bout
Through the night till the suns out
Hitting you with flamers like Butch and Sundance running with the guns out

[Big Pooh]
You wanna? Pull some cream out
I shock your wold like P. Diddy did to Steve Stout
Butter tracks is what I be about
You don't believe me? Call Dunny's house
I'm in the booth with the gutter mouth

[Joe Scudda]
Yo, here's what Scud 'bout
Would he hurt your pride dog, better pick another route
I send you home to your mother's house

[Big Pooh]
Battered and bruised
We show you how to make these moves
Weak little crews
Listen up close cause this joint we wrote is something for you
