[Hook: Strado]
Yeah I'm doing okay, maybe not so great
It's been one of them days, I promise
You think I'm going astray but I'm tryna get paid
I just called to say hey mama
Black Rovers and 4's, be back one day
Not stopping go but I love you
You think I'm going astray but I'm just tryna get paid
I just called to say hey mama
Hey mama, hey mama
Hey mama, hey mama
Hey mama

[Verse 1: Strado]
Ok, Hey mama Myra, how you doing?
I'm just calling in to tell you 'bout the movement
Been locking with Markus and we finally got it moving
Finally got to doing all the things we used to talk about
You told me walk the route & showed you believed
What would I be without you? Yeah you my shoulder to lean upon
When I was dead broke and I needed funds
Spending days inside my head, you relieved me some
See I was on the verge of packing it up
Too many days up on the front line, acting amuck
You end up patching me up, unconditional love
Under conditions unfair, I remember your love
You see I owe you the world, with the moon and stars
You just kept it so real, that's just who you are
Man I swear that it's worth it, taught me nothing is perfect
And I'mma bring it back home, ma I swear that we working

[Hook: Strado]
Yeah I'm doing okay, maybe not so great
It's been one of them days, I promise
You think I'm going astray but I'm tryna get paid
I just called to say hey mama
Black Rovers and 4's, be back one day
Not stopping go but I love you
You think I'm going astray but I'm just tryna get paid
I just called to say hey mama
Hey mama, hey mama
Hey mama, hey mama
Hey mama

[Verse 2: Rikki Blu]
Hey mama Jonie, how you doing boo?
I bought a burner so I can act like I'm texting you
I'm knowing you can't text back, and how could I expect that?
You dipped without a warning, I was planning on Good morning
But hey mama, I swear it's okay mama
Hey I'mma be straight mama
Your son on his way mama, it's true
And even though you ain't here, I'mma still cop you that coupe
And I ain't never been so jealous in my life of my homies
Who can hit their mamas up at any time
I know you had no say so in that shit  but that's alright
And ma, I only go so hard cause I can't sleep at night, I know you hear me
And mama I don't get it, I won't always see the plan
But girl, I'm only human trying hard to be a man
Treat this shit like trial and error, now I know it's now or never
You prepared me for whatever
Hope you know I'm doing better girl

[Hook: Strado]
Yeah I'm doing okay, maybe not so great
It's been one of them days, I promise
You think I'm going astray but I'm tryna get paid
I just called to say hey mama
Black Rovers and 4's, be back one day
Not stopping go but I love you
You think I'm going astray but I'm just tryna get paid
I just called to say hey mama
Hey mama, hey mama
Hey mama, hey mama
Hey mama

[Verse 3: Rapper Big Pooh]
I go to my knees every time that we speak
Oh I see you in my dreams, know that life not complete
You ain't here to witness my misses or share in success
But I know you watching over me impressed
Made some mistakes but who wouldn't when handed the kind of money
That can change ya situation and the life of those around you
My lady would have loved to be around you, a bunch of great grandkids from your grandkids that surround you
I found you in my thoughts while penning this verse
Staring at your obituary, grandmama it hurts
That I can't call or have a convo
Cook your favourite meal or tell you about the world or at least the places that I been to
You were like my best friend too
The support you had for me, there was no end to
You had dreams of me preaching, I had dreams of me teaching
This like like doing both roles, no reaching, I miss you
