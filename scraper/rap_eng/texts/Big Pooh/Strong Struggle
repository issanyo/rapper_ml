[Intro]
Oh oh, mmhmm hmm hmm

[Verse: Blakk Soul]
They say we're living to die, if we stumble off the right path
A lot of us on the right train, but we're cruising down the wrong track
None of it ever adds up, when the phone gets disconnected
Trying to keep the lights on, when the baby keeps on crying

[Vamp]
Everybody's trying to find a way, to, stay above the water
Struggling to survive, see the pain within our eyes to raise our sons and daughters

[Hook]
They say a better day, will come tomorrow
But I got to eat today
They say the storm will rain, away the sorrow
But they don't hear me no

Repeat 2x

But they don't hear me
Hello, hello
Do you hear me, yeah

[Verse: Rapper Big Pooh]
What's up Soul, yeah

They don't hear my stomach growling, mind stay racing
A nigga up late every night steady pacing
Days I'm paper chasing, my people need to eat
Outsiders really think my life sweet
Try going a few days with no sleep
That's like drinking liquor no eats
And even counting sheep, is just an exercise in futility
Show some humility
No this ain't a knock on my ability
When life gives you lemons throw them shits back, enough of the stressing
Enough of falling deep into depression
Enough pill popping and second guessing
Just to be alive is a blessing
If you even thought for a second
That I would go away, and not be here to tell you everyday
That homie I'm a monster!
And I plan on being here forever
And even when I'm gone, I still plan on being here forever!
RAPPER!

[Hook]

Repeats 2x

But they don't hear me
Hello, hello
Do you hear me, yeah
