[Hook]:
I love you baby, I’ll treat you right
I love you baby, I’ll treat you baby
I got work for ya, I got work for ya
I got work for ya, I got work for ya

[Verse One: Big Pooh]
I got work for the cheat, cook to the beat
Putting product on the shelf mean you moving your feet
The allure's too sweet, the fiends can't deny it
One hit hook now the world gotta try it
Lining up to buy it, some niggas steal
Or borrow from their friends just to keep it too real
I am the appeal, sign, seal, deliver it
Get it to your veins, slowly start to simmer it
Get into your brain and now you addicted
O.D.ing everyday cause my shit get you lifted
Far past gifted, cursed at the same time
Plenty other niggas feeling bold wanna take mine
Bench warmers, need partners notes from the top
Checking for the time, go invest in a Glock
Cause I won’t stop putting heat in your system
Boys on this trail try again cause they missed them

[Hook]:
I love you baby, I’ll treat you right
I love you baby, I’ll treat you baby
I got work for ya, I got work for ya
I got work for ya, I got work for ya

[Verse Two: Phonte]
Yo, stay on my job like I’m master minding
Fucking with me would be asinine and
You can take this spare warning as an act of kindness
No purp, Phonte, keep work like the classifieds
This the raw shit that Carolina specializing
Real up, underground
You can call it what you want
Cause truth is nobody goes to work like me
12 times, every year, I’m employee of the month
No off days and no sick leave
No lunch break to get a strip tease
Or sirloin steak at Smith and Willenskys
Listen here, show up early, leave late then disappear
After that I'll see you niggas next fiscal year
Still brown bagging it while you get your lunch out
In the break room, asking me when i’ma punch in
I’m like, "Dawg, when the fuck I ever punched out?!"

[Hook]:
I love you baby, I’ll treat you right
I love you baby, I’ll treat you baby
I got work for ya, I got work for ya
I got work for ya, I got work for ya

[Phonte]:
Hey, so don’t expect me to change
Me and my whole crew doing exceptional things
We well cultured with incredible range
On my way to Brazil, rocking the sketches of Spain
