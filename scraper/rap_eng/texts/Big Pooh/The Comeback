[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh
Haha, I'm in my zone man
You niggas can't take me out my zone
Khrysis, you ready?
Yo, uh

Uh, they say some things change
Friends get lost, better charge 'em to the game
Women change when you get a little fame
Thirsty ass broads wanna drink away the shame
Big headed, getting carried with a crane
Underground nigga making money in his lane
A couple grooves help me make a couple moves
A few moves made me cause a little news
Nigga, this is me, no mus'
Poobie on his Hova shit, I Will Not Lose
My mama said never argue with the fools
They drag you down till you swimming with the schools
Uh, who made me drown it in the pool?
Knowledge is a weapon so I'm packing my tool
These muh'fuckers acting like they so cool
Homie you the past, I embody what it new

[Hook] {X2} {*imitating Busta Rhymes from A Tribe Called Quest's "Scenario"*}
It's like uh, uh, uh, all over the track
Like uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back
Uh, uh, uh, all over the track
Like uh, pardon me y'all, my nigga run it back

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Uh, they say I took a step back
I say I stepped up, niggas don't know the facts
Better yet, niggas don't know the act
Talking out of pocket, that'll get you hoes slapped
Nimrods banging on they compacts
It's all entertainment, I read it to relax
No weave, just tracks by the bushel
Every now and then need something that'll put you
I mean, I still strive to be great
But outsiders don't understand what it takes
Made plenty mistakes, learned to live with regrets
People talk big but I'm my own threat
Real talk, going at my own neck
Bitch numbers up cause the bar's been set
Listen, I know I garnered your respect
Check for the rhyme while you nod your neck

[Hook] {X2}
