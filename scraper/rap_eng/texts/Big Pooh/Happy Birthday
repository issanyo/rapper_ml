See, you'll always be a part of me
I'll be good for you, wait and see...

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
My mama told me Thomas you should keep fighting
The words that I heard is you should keep writing
Blank stare out the window, watching a plastic bag go exactly as the wind blow
Steady is the tempo, these people think it's simple waking up every morning trying to figure out where time go
My thoughts ain't clear, how am I wind up here?
Now I'm drinking a beer, it's 10 o'clock in the a.m. me and my body swaying to the mayhem
People like it ain't him, staring at me like they looking at an evil twin
Half grin the only thing that I could muster, knowing at that exact moment my life was really flustered
My house flooded, career studded, me and my baby got our backs to the wall like it ain't nothing
Actually I'm breaking down though, my life's soundtrack the beautiful sounds of a piano
Played by a two year old, banging on the keys
Every night I'm on my knees asking God mercy please help me out
I know he hear my please without a doubt (ha)
Now it's time for me to get out, keep pushing
No cushion, hungrier than ever, I'm willing to grind forever
Fuck whether I'm the postman
The end of the night propose a toast fam
Trying to fake it til you make it, you dont understand

[Hook: Jared Evans]
I was never happy, but if you're here with me then we could sing a song
How ill would that be? If we could celebrate forever til we're gone
What lies around me, is everything I need so let the candles go
(uh huh) happy birthday ya'll, happy birthday ya'll

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Parked the car I burned out out of second gear
Every year, I'm talking bout it's my year
On that 12th now, working on the 5th year
Trying to navigate the world, but its rocky here
No Adrians, No Apollo Creeds
I flipping soil for my future seeds
I'm tired of flipping soil and I don't own the deeds
If a snakes in your yard better cut the weeds
Preoccupied with want;s, can't afford your needs
And the teacher told me I wouldn't succeed (haha)
Can you hear me now? Margie's middle child making mama really proud
You can finally smile, tomorrow means a brighter day
Happy birthday ya'll, wipe your tears away

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Happy birthday ya'll, Happy birthday-birthday, yeah (3x)
