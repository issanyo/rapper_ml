[Sample of Jerry Butler's "Whatever Goes Around"]
Whatever goes around, comes around
Every lifetime is a lesson, this is what I found
No matter who you are (It don't matter), gonna have your ups and downs
(Time to come up, baby, time to come up, it's whatever)
Whatever goes around, comes around

[Rapper Big Pooh - Verse One]
Uh, yo, uh...I walk, wit' a swag of a letterman
No amateur here, I'm a veteran
You couldn't find many more who is better than
Big Pooh when he rocking the mic
No games, no hype, just mind and skills
Pure determination and a heart full of will
My nigga Tiggalo held me down for real
But it's time now for me to ante up on the bills
Cause at the point when we signed our deal
I was three years young, now I'm five plus some
Write, to the beat of 9th's wonderful drum
Overhung by the snare and the bassline
It's face time, commentators they deface my -
Place I pick up the pace, cause I belong here
Marathon man, outlastin the chariot
I got a bone to pick and 'bout to bury it

[Hook]
This letter goes out to whoever want read it (whoever)
Please share it with the world cause I won't repeat it (I won't repeat it)
Believe me, I know who all need it
So for you, I wrote this letter (check it out)
I woke up, wit' an epiphany (Whaaat?)
It's like this feelin came over me (WHAAAT?!)
Cause right is where I'm 'posed to be
So for you, I wrote this letter

[Verse Two]
Uh, yo...I awoke wit' a lot on my chest
And every breath that I took wasn't gettin' any better, P
I swear, some niggas wish they could replace me
No bullshittin, I watched the rumors chase me
'til it had me in the corner, (back down)
I mean, my back against the wall yo, I thought I was a goner
I let the pressure get the best of -
I let words make a mess of what's left of my pride but
I refuse to hide, behind the silence and smiles
It's been a while though, you hearin me now
Remember every foul comment that you motherfuckers spoke?
Well, I Rakim these niggas now, I Ain't No Joke
This is no hoax, back to bench scrubs like Tremaine Foulks
Coast to coast, please put up a toast
For the most, slept on!
Better open your eyes 'fore yo' ass get crept on, surprise..
