[Verse 1: Last Standing Poet]
Fuckk, swag, bookk, sets, ghetto
Uhh, I'm in the LAD book group
Threw another hook go
Got the recipe, tastes best when its cookked slow
Gotta tie my armour while I'm in this bitch, sup though
Obama caught Osama, but they still don't caught me though
I'ma bring it backk and makke a sackk on the repo, equal
No one matches me, nigga mom's tragedy
This one's for my daddy so I spit until no batteries
Kkeep a pack of Zig Zags, OCB's and packk Swisher blunts
I'ma smoke at practice, brunch, tea an' fat dinner, lunch
Smokke up whilst I'm gaming, rap, eat her when I'm makin' punch
If I chill with ladies, you can bet I chill with naked blondes
If I chill with rappers, you can bet they don't arrange you some
If I chill with actors, you bet they pay the stage in 1
I blaze with girls, get paid in funds
If you dared I take you some
Spliff in hand, I'm blazin' one
Hands i make it break you some
Android o's on swag with a passion
L.S.P splashin', say fuck fashion
Be what it is then, art in transit
A thoroughbred, hide yo head
Rapin' game, hide yo kids
You won't be the same if you was just as high as I just did

Takke another, takke a, takke a sip off the O.E
Takke another, takke a, takke a sip off the O.E
Let me hit the joint, Let me hit the joint, Let me hit the...

And the dope addicts say...

Make me feel like a cloud in the sky

Yeah, lemme tell you how it went man, yo
It went roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
I got so high one time I thought I broke it
The high barrier, slow coming down
I was walkin' down the street but I didn't touch the ground
I'm used to the red cups, overflowing brown, jack
Bring me martin or a purple back crown
Passin' on the joint, really how that sound
Especially when you spending time in somebody else's town, so
We rolled up, I puff, puff, hale
Knew something was different by the way that it smelled
That's that Cali, prescription at its finest
8-1 grade you don't find in the Carolina's
I promise, at that point I was stoned, and all I wanted to do is take a plane ride home
We settled for some tacos and a glass of lemonade
Nice summer day so I kicked it in the shade
A couple hours later to my high I was a slave
I'm past paranoia, past had the munchies
Past taking naps, felt like I'm on the bungee cord
My lord, I ain't smoke another day
Until I got the Rizla

Takke another, takke a, takke a sip off the O.E

You can catch me Manhattan baggin' mad bitches
With a sack, you can't reach me like your baggages
Where it's at, I'm in Cali at the flag
Getting highered like a flag
If you tie it take a drag, with
Bones in the bag, with
Some munchies, Hennessy, and dank that smell's tragic
Flyin' high, I expire then I Spark again
Called my supplier, show me fire, then I walk with him
And if it is that trip to piff, hard to know I cop that shit
I ain't know what, hide yo bitch she just got to the topic with
Got on top the tip till we ride till she poppin' top of here
LSP, I'm a motherfukkin beast look at me
Benny C, Marcus B, and shout out to the timothy
Envy me, MVP, sippin on that VS
Hope be playin' PS3, I'll never be stressed me
I'm on my business seat, I grind these bitches g
You got to witness, the spitness get real quick
Eating chips with shit now that's what I call a diss, shit
Leave life alone I'ma live it like a misfit
Level headed mistress, never better, piff splif
Never edit this clique now bust some shit and Takke, takke, takke

Takke another, takke a, takke a sip off the O.E
Takke another, takke a, takke a sip off the O.E
Let me hit the joint, Let me hit the joint, Let me hit the...
