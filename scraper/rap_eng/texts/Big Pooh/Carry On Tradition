Keepin' it real
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
I let the words magnetize me
Nothing surprises me
This is more than a friendly little rivalry
No games nigga even though that's what they called
Trying to make a summer in the middle of the fall
Trying to save a dollar, fuck burning down the mall
Your career's like a car
You praying it don't stall in the morning when you crank it
No plan b's, no security blanket
Failure not an option
I worked 30 years on this lifelong doctrine
Burnt a few careers the public they adopted
Comes the original, no religion per say
But me I'm kind of spiritual, recognize the higher power
This is more than me bragging dog
Rap's a headache, this is more like the Tylenol
And this here is my vision
(Keeping it real)
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition

Beats make me falling asleep, I keep falling

So I run it back like I'm Earl Campbell
Walter Payton got you egg kids in a scramble
Do damage leave competition in shambles
Flame burning like an everlasting lit candle
I'm nice until the moment I retire
These words will inspire the rest of ya'll to think twice
I admit I'm your supplier
I'm trying to take you higher
Be dope, that's my good advice

(Beats make me falling asleep, I keep falling)

[Verse 2: Mikkey Halsted]
Big Pooh let me hold the track
That's a dead end, something like a cul-de-sac
Never been that hard to find, I'm probably where your ho is at
This rap game's a minstrel show, little brother showed you that
Stay with the poker face, go ahead play your cards
I see you little 16s then I raise the bar
Suckers shuck and jive and smiling for a living
(Keeping it real)
Others such as myself is trying to carry on tradition

(Beats make me falling asleep, I keep falling)

From where we can't afford to sleep, that's why we never dream
And I'm envisioning some shit that ya'll ain't never seen
The track's the match, the words I write are like the kerosene
The mic's the cotton-filled bottle that quickly blows the seam
It's time to get up off the sidelines and pick a team
Either the Wrong City Devils or the Elohims
I'm in the belly trying to duck the places made for crooks
Smoke like the Ethiopians blowing on the ancient kush
I'm trying to get up off the corner
Searching for the lime like I opened a Corona
Niggas ain't hard G, they sweet as Arizona tea
Never fuck with John McCain but how does Arizona see
Yeah, I'm Ernie Barnes mixed with Van Gogh
Monopolize the game, pay me when you pass Go
Suckers shuck and jive and smiling for a living
(Keeping it real)
Others such as myself is trying to carry on tradition
And it's like that
