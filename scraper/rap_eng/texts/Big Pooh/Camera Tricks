Feat. Chaundon, Erica Thompson

[Chorus]
Smile baby, pose for the camera
Welcome to a world girl where we all amateurs
We can leave the lights on, you can take your clothes off
Press the red button just in case you wanna show off
Smile baby, pose for the camera
Welcome to a world girl where we all amateurs
We can leave the lights on, you can take your clothes off
Press the red button just in case you wanna show off

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Freaks wanna get to the hotel room
I presume it's because they wanna lick
How many times will it take 'fore the bone finally breaks?
You surprised when that one-eye SPITS~!
No need to sit in the corner, get a lil' close
No lie, I kinda dig shy chicks
So I start off a little slow, a long night to go
Maybe kiss her while I'm feelin on her tits
Just a few moments to the huggin, then we get to rubbin
Then we go for kissin, me and her lickin
Now I'm back stickin, she was so smitten
Woke the next morning, she gone, good riddance
Another night, another notch
'Fore I left for the next city, there's knocks
Open up the front door, now there's cops
Can't believe that bitch said I raped her, glad that I taped her!

[Chorus]
[Chaundon]
Never trust a big butt and a smile
No matter HOW the good-good feels to you, I'ma keep it real witchu
Last year back in Germany, I felt like Ron Burgandy
This one hoe was throwin her pussy at me with urgency
Gave me a handjob in front of Big Pooh and 'nem
Lickin on her lips, showin me what she can do with them
Nasty lil' bitch but I'm STILL gon' fuck her doe
Camcord the shit, son I'm NEVER gonna trust a hoe
Hidden under clothes that I wore from the night befo'
Kept the lights on, wore her out until her eyes closed
Took the condom off and threw it in the trash can
Went to sleep but she got up to get the condom, goddamn!
Lucky that my camcord' was on
Record her nasty ass tryin to steal the seed of Chaun'
So when the heat is on, and child service come and knock
I'ma show the tape to get me off the hook on the spot, ah!

[Chorus]
[Outro: Erica Thompson]
Smile baby, pose for the camera
Smile baby, pose for the camera
Smile baby, pose for the camera
Smile baby, pose for the camera
