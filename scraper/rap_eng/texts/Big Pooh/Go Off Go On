[Intro] [Big Pooh]
Yeah, uh. Rapper. Ha, yeah. Uh, some of that good LB shit. Ha, yeah, uh

[Verse One]
I ain't a freedom fighter
I'm a freedom writer
Doin' this shit in spite of
People's opinions
They all minions
Be a mini Un
Put this Jigga to your gut, stab yourself son
Pardon my pun
Great in my own mind
I let the world find out on they own time
Ascend to my prime
Every step I climb
Throw they two cents in
Have a seat in line
I'm just speakin' mine
I tend to do that
Broads over there wanna stare like, "Who dat?"
Big brown nigga got tons of charm
Rapper Pooh in this bitch, better ring the alarm
I don't mean no harm
Been deprived for years
Just look at LB as you see our peers
Won't see no tears
Don't cry for me
Got people out there that'll ride for me
Church

[Hook] [Phonte]
So go off go on
LB back with a brand new joint
So fresh like a brand new morn
Play this everyday like a brand new song
It don't start till we say, "Go"
And it don't stop till we say so
We we don't stop till we make mo'
All the ladies say "Ow" and the fellas say "Ho"
Ho ho ho ho ho

[Verse Two] [Phonte]
Phontigga get on the mic and I dispel what-
Ever lies you niggas would try to tell but
They can't see Tay in his gangsta lean
I'm fresh off the scene like a nigga yell, "Cut"
Slidin' through your city
Checkin' out the pretty ladies
But they actin' all Raphael Saadiq/saditty
"What you mean girl? You don't even know me
You probably used to niggas spittin' that Bo Peep
Nursery rhyme shit can't compare to this strong ass, grown ass man
Check out my goatee
You missed the best one
I'm off to the next one
So hard to say goodbye, word to Cochise
Me and Big Pooh comin' through on the chariot
Rollin' over y'all buffoon ass niggas
Cartoon ass niggas, y'all Hannah-Barbara/ians
Phonte, number one, rhyme animal candidate
And I'm out

[Hook] [Phonte]
So go off go on
LB back with a brand new joint
So fresh like a brand new morn
Play this everyday like a brand new song
It don't start till we say, "Go"
And it don't stop till we say so
We we don't stop till we make mo'
All the ladies say "Ow" and the fellas say "Ho"
Ho ho ho ho ho
