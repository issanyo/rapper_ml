[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
A yo I set it off like I'm F Gary gray
When I step up on the scene niggas have nothing to say
Bite your tongue keep quiet I start riots
Homie this ain't recess if you feel a way hit that eject
Reject pity cause Ima be back
They sleeping with a c-pap
I see racks to destroy track
This ain't b-boy rap, this ain't d-boy trap
They say be more black I tell them grease these naps
They setting traps all the time
I study the art of rhyme you ready to order mine
I slaughter like Columbine
I'm doing just fine without others
Go ask my brother
And when you see my nieces tell'em uncle Thomas love 'em
Alone in a 4 cornered room walls padded
Where nothing really matters
But the matter I done had it
My ego been shattered my pride battered
My heart been bruised so much I turned addict
A glutton for the pain
A motherfucka shame
What a nigga go thru before he really wanna change
I really wanna hang the old me
But the new me wouldn't survive without the old me listen closely
Rappers don't approach me
Critics tried roast but I still landed like I dropped down on 4 feet
J let's the drums beat
I'm letting off steam
Why be apart yours when this is the dream team muthafucka

[Verse 2: Joe Scudda]
Posted up in the corner, homie you border
Whole game is dead call up the coroner
911 on the dial, scenery looking foul
Walked in with a frown, left out with a smile
Attitude like fuck a mall
Vintage thrift store pieces fuck a mall
No time for it, gotta grind for it
John Hancock scribbled out on the line for it
Damn
Told me they couldn't read it
Rolled out sevens told me they couldn't beat it
Scooped up all cash so cold it fridge
Cancel they feelings,so made they livid
Watch how i live it now they wanna imitate
A dude the game couldn't intimidate
Cause i refuse to assimilate
With the in crowd yea I'm a rebel
And i been proud of who i am
And where i stand as a man
Forever vowed to hold my nuts in my hand
Threw the gambit I'm wilding
Fuck dat on any planet I'm styling

[Verse 3: T3]
Appreciate me while I'm still here
Or do a magic trick disappear out my ocular
My spectrum can't be seen with binoculars
Whole life life should of put it in a journal
Read it at night small light nocturnal
I'm a like wise guy living true lies
Call me mr. mix cause I'm much to live
If you ain't talking about a grip nor talking about god
Then ain't shit to say to me, you stepping out of line
Yeah y'all niggas make believe fairy tale lovers
Can't stay a head of us or parallel of us
Even though we stay a float like a parasail hover
Yeah i saw my fought and i comb threw it
Now a nigga Tom cruising ,yeah get on my level kid
You know what i could of did
But instead dog a stack green pyramids
