[Intro: Sample (Four Tops)]
By the time I get to Phoenix
She'll be risin'

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
How you doin’, I’m Mr. Dream Merchant
You’re message sounded kinda urgent
I dropped everything for you playa and stopped workin'
Came right over, copped a spot on your sofa
Tapped you on your shoulder
Now your hard times are over
Or maybe, I know I might sound a little crazy
But many people last, every lick tho, be lately
I'm doing ya'll a favor like
I shine a little bit spotlight
Watch ya'll niggas just stay actin right
Always asking me for more of the love
But when I settle the score, you wanna settle for four
You say 9-Sixes bring more bitches
And more bitches constitute having more figures
And more figures mean an entourage and mo’ niggas
Bloodless actions
Until I have to break out the scissors, and cut you off
I toughed you up cuz your style was soft
Stick you to a man, here from a spot of the loaf
I’m the stick off your shoulder that you just brushed off
Sold your life to the Merchant, now your soul’s in the lost
It calls to be Coca when you fizz out like soda
Capped your salary chunks till you get a little older

[Hook: Rapper Big pooh]
Mr. Dream Merchant
I sell dreams, I sell schemes
Said you anything for a bite of that cream
But once you get what you get
It’s not as good as it seems, so
Just open up your eyes (your eyes)
Ayyo, I’m Mr. Dream Merchant
I sell dreams, I sell schemes
Said you anything for a bite of that cream
But once you get what you get
It’s not as good as it seems, so
Just open up your eyes (your eyes)

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Okay, so now you ‘bout to blast off
For the first time in your life
Get your cash off, burn a charge like hash, paw
Live your life kinda fast, huh
Dodged a rabbit, the advocate
Please don’t make me laugh son
I build careers that last, smashed the ass
Of the anxious troops who cross my path
Now they really gassed
Broke down the system, cash
Make this hip-hop a way of the past
And I’m supposed to be glad
Suckas like you is a dime a dozen
And they be rhyming, cousin, you lying cousin
Might thug and get a rep and I helped you out
Favored your spout but now people tired as hell
Not in awe of the good talk, the lure
Nine hundred and ninety nine thousand ways to make your whole body part
From your soul that I control
Mr. Dream Merchant wins
That’s how the story is told

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh]
I’m Mr. Dream Merchant
I sell dreams, I sell schemes
Said you anything for a bite of that cream
But once you get what you get
It’s not as good as it seems, so
Just open up your eyes
Ayyo, I’m Mr. Dream Merchant
I sell dreams, I sell schemes
Said you anything for a bite of that cream
But once you get what you get
It’s not as good as it seems, so
Just open up your eyes (your eyes)
