[Intro - Big Pooh]
This joint right here
Is going out to all y'all groupies
Male groupies, female groupies
See a groupie is a groupie
This right here for y'all
Yea

[Verse 1 - Big Pooh]
Check out this lame broad, call me up
I know I'm fine as fuck but she got the hot nail vapors
I ain't stack no paper I don't walk around wearing gators
Shit I'm still walking
I'm still the same Pooh, I still do the things I used to
I still hang with the same crew
The way I act now I blame to
The other chick I speak about got addicted to the fame too
I rocked a couple joints the album sell, I get a couple points
Small change to the pockets
I don't understand these broads' logic
I break bread with the fam before I hit em with a piece a profit
I'm allergic to you hoes, stop it
Got me wondering was the attention before
Or after the shock of seeing Big Pooh's pic in the store
Got your eyes money green and me slamming the door

[Hook]
Now ladies love me, girls adore me
I mean even the ones who never saw me, hey yey
They love the way I rhyme at a show
The reason why man I don't know now, hey yey
You groupie niggas need to go away

[Verse 2 - Big Pooh]
Is it the way I rhyme that got you stressed?
Sitting in the back sweating and looking a mess
Nervous even pervis you shots with the bullets
You pussycat, I had no choice but to pull it
But who wouldn't, swinging aimlessly
You got the nerve to say you in the same vein as me
How ashamed are we you not the man that we claimed to be
Now our fame is in jeopardy
You shouldn't have slept on me, the mic I had to snatch back
And react like white boys in the mosh pit
The fly shit is easy to get stuck on
I penned joints for you to vibe to and get your fuck on
You couldn't last one round
I suggest you back up off my nuts and put the dick down
You now in tune to the sounds
9th is wonderful, I know you nodding right now

[Hook x2]
