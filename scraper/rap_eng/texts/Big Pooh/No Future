[Sample]
You say we have a future and together we'll find it
You say we have a future and together we'll find it

[Verse 1]
All black O.B.X., all white Cadillac
Middle of the summer but I slumber where the snow be at
Trying to mack Zodiacs
Had me a Zoziac
J.T. banging out the truck bringing Sexyback
Prom played the background
V.I.P. no pat down
Five star, gold trim
Tell me you impressed while looking for a boyfriend
More like a toy friend
Play around, won't stay around when the joy end
Nah, she ain't like that
Told me she ain't like that
Mad cause she wrote me and it took a while to write back
My nigga told me, "Tell her anything she wanna hear."
She finally gave it up was another nigga's shears
Yeah, he cut, I ain't fuck after putting in the time
The next time I saw her gave her a little piece of mind
Said a little piece of shine would've went a long way
You trying to be together is a game I don't play
There's no future

[Hook] {​x2}​
She said she want me but I don't
Really see a future so I won't
Cause it's just "No future"
I need to really let you go
But the way I act girl you should've known

[Verse 2]
Somewhere on the west coast, looking for a good night
Things are kinda rushed but I had me a good flight
Back to the west again
Back, you impressed again
Not because I hit but I call you like a best friend
Westin, Sheraton, share me with your girlfriend
Might go out to eat but we back to where it all begin
Hotel, don't tell [?] but we gotta part
He gon' have your body but you told me I'ma own your heart
What?
I'ma own your heart?
Why we even start?
This was fun in the beginning but you torn apart
I think you undecided, but you trying to hide it
I sent a text message, now you getting all excited
So here we go on this merry-go-round
You told yourself you had enough cause of the way I left town
But you back in my voice mails talking 'bout the past
Even though we had no future, you still offering ass

[Hook]
