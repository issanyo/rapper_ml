[Verse 1]
They swear niggas win when they sin the most
Temporarily be the toast
Guns and butter on what matters the least, watch them overdose
Let them hang, nigga, hang by their gold ropes
Smoke dope until you're comatose, no hope
For that butter, niggas die broke, third eye woke
Poke holes in the American dream, run out of options
Made it easy, you can hustle and scheme but one problem
They're building private prisons just to house niggas
For cheap labor, that's why, nigga
They call it PIC, it's not a club, but you're VIP
Series of numbers that replace your ID
Home of the cowardly, freedom ain't free
The revolution won't be shown on TV
We're too busy watching fake reality, you see

[Hook]
What goes up  comes down
Dog chase tail, go 'round and 'round
We all hypnotized when we hear the sounds
Ever seen a clown with a smile that was upside down
You see it
They swear we going to the promise land (right)
They swear they better than the better man (right)
We need to get our shit together man (right)
Probably listening like, whatever man

[Verse 2]
They swear niggas be killing when they're just killing
Waking up every morning, hollow, no feeling
You hear the rap, money stack, how it touch the ceiling
Got to tell my nephews, they really have a ceiling
That's to be honest, you ain't getting everything that's promised
40 acres and a mule, right, work so they can take
Cost of living tax 'til your back break
No grass, but you're still missing the snakes, til they slither on you
Who tired of looking at the middle man
The one on top, so he devised a plan
And who too busy thinking promised land
Then realize the real lies pinpoint the  scam
Shooting the messenger, that's only part of our conditioning
They keep trying to tell us but we're not listening
You want to hide it, put it in a book
They want to hide it, put it on a corner, watch it cook, you see it

[Hook]
What goes up  comes down
Dog chase tail, go 'round and 'round
We all hypnotized when we hear the sounds
Ever seen a clown with a smile that was upside down
You see it
They swear we going to the promise land (right)
They swear they better than the better man (right)
We need to get our shit together man (right)
Probably listening like, whatever man
