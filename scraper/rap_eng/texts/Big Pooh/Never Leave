{I'll never leave, I'll never leave, never leave baaaaa-baaaaay 4X}

Little Brother, Mick Boogie on the mixtape
Aiyyo Mick check it out man, it's a lotta niggas
That think Little Brother can't do no street joint, youknowwhatI'msayin?
So now I-I gotta get on this track
I gotta "Justify My Thug" a little bit, youknowwhatI'msayin?
I gotta - I gotta go back and moisturize my situation, youknowwhatI'msayin?
Let these boys know I can do it anyway they want, youknowhatI'msayin?
It's Phontigga, it's for the streets!

C'mon, this is for my niggas on the corner
Them boys on the block, steady movin that work
All through your community, you need a fundraiser?
Them boys'll come through and even slang at the church
In the kitchen all day long over the stove, yep
Servin them fiends, steady cookin them O's
'Til the smell get all on they clothes; keep niggas heavy
In the streets, and they fuck the fattest of hoes
See the fiends line up tryna get that fix
Anytime, day or night, they'll scratch that itch
Have you runnin to ya mans like, "This that shit!"
Yeah, they paper stay long and they money is thick
I know a lotta niggas gon' have to run this back like
"Damn Tay, when the fuck you start promotin crack?"
It ain't as bad as it might seem; I'm just shoutin out
My niggas down at Krispy Kreme, now holla back, what?

{Love Unlimited sample plays while Phonte overlaps}
OH!! Krispy Kreme will never leave the streets, nigga!!
Dunkin' Donuts - FUCK 'EM!!

Glazed donuts, chocolate donuts, apple fritters
Whatever you need, it's NOTHIN!
You get that Krispy Kreme, all the dough boys go CRAAAZY, OH!!
Big Pooh, c'mon!

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah, I make moves, make money
Made a lotta other people smile when shit wah'nt funny
Always lookin out thinkin, "What they want from me?"
I seen better times, everyday it ain't sunny
When the birds ain't chirpin, niggas at home
Feelin sorry for themselves when they should be out workin
Witness no hustle, seen no drive
He feel hopeless, niggas strivin and you wonder why you struggle
In the past years, operated with a muzzle
Saw moods change but thangs begin to bubble
{?} hugs from women who now luh' you
Sat back, watched all the pieces to the puzzle
Put it all together, tryna make sense
But until they see dollars, it ain't gettin no better
Niggas get ahead of themselves
But Pooh been on the grind tryna rhyme yo sense and yo ?swerve?, you gotta KNOW!!

{Love Unlimited sample plays while Big Pooh overlaps}
Oh my GAWD!!
I'm on my muh'fuckin grizzy right now!
*says teasingly* Hi haters! *Pooh cracks up*
I know you muh'fuckers can't get enough of me, man
It know it's some niggas out there, they can't sleep at night
They up, they nervous, they wonderin if I'm in the lab
You fuckin RIGHT I'm in the lab, nigga!
Ha! We got another one!
