[Intro]
Uh...check me out baby
Ayo, I be the one Phonte
Representin' Little brother..
From now, never be another
It's Phonte, Pooh and 9th wonder
And my man Big Dho, that's undiscovered
Gettin' freaky wit them broads undercover
Take it way back like Mr. Lover Lover
Ayo, we keep it runnin like this
From the top of the dome light it up with a kiss
Kubanot jada Phonte, the style playa
Party ghost, peace out niggas, I'll see ya later
Phonte coming through just like dic-tator
Off the top of the dome through in the playground
Because its just like "yo I didn't say that"
Loot it up wherever my nigga 'Lay at, lets light it up

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
The most magnificent
Pooh speak the unlipatent
For the rhyme impatent
Complicate plenty circumtants
I got enough friends to last my life
Fuck your feelings and your home town rice
The stage is mine if I rocked the mic
Lead a love up the path of light
It's due time to set a couple niggas straight
And get this beef off my chest plate
Bitch niggas tryin to frustrate, dap you up on the low really hate
Is that the price of cats being to great?
Can I live without you all in my face? and ya hands high
See that's the shit that I be talking about
Behind your back faggots runnin' they mouth, just stick a dick in it
And have a seat homie, let us step to the floor front
Made you display, all up in your store front
Thats what the people want
The champs back in here
Lets shout the name out loud and clear, we light it up....(echos)

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Yo
Time to set the record staight
I rock a Gordon Gartrell with seven buttons, still I fascinate
This politics shit'll ruin kids
Niggas be thinking just because they tight that mean they music is
That ain't the way it work dog, go exam your roots
Look niggas dead in they eyes, start demanding the truth
Produce are not properly commanding his loops
I ain't saying it wack, that shit'll win a grammie or mute
I'm like that half crazed man on the roof
The ex-vietnam vet with no heart pan-handling loot
With a mack 10 raised to shoot ya
Phonte's a big dog, betta get ya bitches sprayed or neutered (cat growl)
Last year been praised and tutored
Radioheads downloading my shit, the OK compute it
Got plans to shine, style 3x's dope on eastern standard time
And I'm gon handle mine lets light it up baby...(echo)
