[Intro - repeat 4X] *whispering*
Just friends, just friends
I just wanna be, just friends

[Verse 1]
Aiyyo let's get one thing clear my dear
I ain't lookin for a girl, I don't care what you hear
I don't care who did what and put who in your ear
Big Pooh gettin his this year - I'm talkin bout
Meetin chicks with some business
I just wanna be your friend with privileges
Not talkin on the phone all night about
Where I was or who unless we went out
Don't fuss and pout, cause you know how I do
Always chill with the crew but make time for you
She the young-un on the side, point guard in my squad
Nicknamed her B.G. cause she love to Go Hard
My God, this is the master plan
I just wanna be your friend and not your man
You understand? Do you hear what I'm sayin?
Cause the kid ain't playin, word

[Hook] (Intro is repeated in background)
There's some things that I gotta say
Especially when you look my way
This one thing that you must understand
I just wanna be your friend and not your man
There's some things that I wanna do
Especially when I look at you
This one thing that you must understand
I just wanna be your friend and not your man

[Verse 2]
I don't have a problem with monogamy
But the problem be, these chicks eyein me
They see the probably, like I got some cheese
And I'mma take 'em out shoppin, spend a couple of G's
Bitch, Please! Snoop said it best
+I don't luh these hoes+, and I suggest
That, you find another sucka nigga for that game plan
I play a whole 'nother game, man
I'm on some new when the Pooh gotta see you work
And thell they're not exclusive, see me merk
It works, upfront, you don't see no hurt
No runnin to your friends like, "Pooh did dirt"
I'm just tryna have some fun 'fore it's said and done
And while I'm young, gotta get it all in
Be FRIENDS - that's what it's all about
I ain't tryna be your man, so don't even go to that route
So check it ouuuut!

[Hook 2X]

[Outro]
Yeah, ha! Get your drinks up
To my nigga Z-Mag, get your Rossie out
We gon' sit back on this one..
Let this one ride out
Young Khrysis, Big Pooh
"Sleepers", yeah
Drums!
