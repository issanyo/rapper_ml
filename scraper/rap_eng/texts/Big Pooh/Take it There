[Rapper Big Pooh]
Ain't no way y'all could stop me
Even if you made a carbon copy, I'd out-rhyme myself
Put your wack shit back on the shelf and push back the release
You now dealing with an untamed beast
I'm on the rise like an oven of yeast
Been rocking these streets since Culture Club had album released
In the States, around here money we play for big cakes
And Betty Crocker ain't got nothin on that
Nothin on DAT, nothin on wax, plenty to play
Plenty to say, exclusive, come check this new shit
A blue chip but still looking for a scholarship
Better get him now cause he's promising
That's alright do', y'all ain't gotta fuck with me
Give me some months and you stuck with me
Y'all monkey'd out, I'm in your life just funkin around
Thumpin around, pumpin my sound, now dream on this here

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh]
Y'all niggas ain't really tryna take it there
You talkin big but you ain't tryna take it there
Your house, your car, the mall, nigga I don't care
J-League niggas bout to bring it anywhere
Yo-Yo! Y'all niggas ain't tryna take it there
You talkin big but you ain't tryna take it there
Your house, your car, the mall, nigga I don't care
J-League niggas bout to bring it anywhere

[Phonte]
Man, I was chillin at the mall on a Saturday
Me and my girl and my son at the matinee
The album just dropped so people start to gravitate
Approached by five niggas dressed like Little Fabulae
Doo rags and Yankee caps on, this kind of sad to say
I showed 'em love, ain't no need for getting mad today
Thanks for supporting us dog, that's all I had to say
"Man, that nigga 'Te cain't rhyme" Man, nigga no the fuck you didn't!!!
Goddamn it we gon' settle the beef!
Niggas heard me singing hooks on The Listening, y'all thought it was sweet
In my face rhyming, tryna redeem somethin
Claiming you from up north like that's really supposed to mean somethin
This rap shit I take serious
I ain't the nicest cat in NC, bitch I'm the nicest nigga period
That's how them lames got dropped
Had all them Chinese bitches clapping for me at the Flaming Wok

[Hook: Phonte]
Y'all niggas ain't really tryna take it there
You're talkin big but you ain't tryna take it there
Your house, your car, the mall, nigga I don't care
It's J-League, yo we bring it to you anywhere
Y'all motherfuckers ain't really tryna take it there
You're talkin big but you ain't tryna take it there
Basketball practice, prayer meeting, I don't care
Little Brother, yo we bring it y'all anywhere

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Don't take my speech for granted
Them jaded eyes will get you topped off
A hard knock off, you see this block of
Down South niggas, yeah we get our rocks off

[Phonte]
Just to show y'all niggas that we not soft
Bring the hot sauce dog, this hella proper
Niggas heard Peedi one time
Now everybody think we wave our shirts like helicopters
But I ain't hating though, ain't nothin wrong with that
Bringin it live giving y'all a little more than that

[Hook: Phonte]
Ay yo-yo, y'all ain't really tryna take it there
You're talkin big but you ain't tryna take it there
Your house, your car, the mall, nigga I don't care
It's J-League, yo we bring it to you anywhere
Y'all motherfuckers ain't really tryna take it there
You're talkin big but you ain't tryna take it there
Your house, the car, the mall, nigga I don't care
It's Little Brother, yo we give it you anywhere
