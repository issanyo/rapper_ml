[Myone] [Verse One]
Represent the next movement
They got the revolution televised
All my people rise and recognized
We come from devine with three eyes that beam sharp like lasers
We be the Genesis like Sega
Supreme in the face of you haters
Take over this industry
Spread love instead of tryin' to be the enemy
Y'all quick to kill be slow to build
Can a brother live?
That's why we find Islam and travel through hollow minds
Penetrate the soul with a rhyme
Things gotta change
But y'all ain't listening
The soul be travelin'
Y'all been missin' the train
The brain unravelin'
Stabbin' you with a lyrical javelin
I ain't havin' it
Understand my peoples ain't savages

[Hook]
It goes one for the money and two for the show
Three about to bring it and four to let you know
Rise
Cause we up here you need to look up
LB and SFP, the world is shook up
Just rise
Cause I can't wait
I can't wait
No I can't wait
Just rise
No I can't wait
I won't fake it
I can't wait

[Verse Two] [Big Pooh]
Rise like the pop bubblin'
Rumblin' through the state of N.C
Beggin' these wanna be rappers not to test me
A bunch of fancy wordplay don't impress me
I got a couple metaphors and some similes
I'm like a countdown on New Years Eve
Most anticipated, niggas wouldn't believe
That Pooh be work, take trips overseas
Or I make one album
I'm workin' on three
Got the Strange Fruit Project
Kev workin' with me
Doin' the Texas two step, drinkin' hella ice teas
No ice in it please
Them the right degrees
I'm the coolest motherfucker on the M.I.C

[Phonte]
And when you invite me
No telling what it might be
Cause when I rhyme I devour that shit
Niggas wanna rush me and cats get touchy
Cause they know 'Te means every vowel of that shit
The A's and E's and I's don't be surprised
If I O (owe) U (you) an apology after I set it
Rough with the lyrics
But so gentile (gentle) with the flow
Most mics think I'm anti-semetic
Y'all niggas need to dead it, it's on
Man,you crazy if you think next to us you will ever get shine on
B.E.T., Uncut or Total Request Live
I ain't gotta like yours
But you gon' respect mine

[Hook]
It goes one for the money and two for the show
Three about to bring it and four to let you know
Rise
Cause we up here you need to look up
LB and SFP, the world is shook up
Just rise
Cause I can't wait
I can't wait
No I can't wait
Just rise
No I can't wait
I won't fake it
I can't wait

[Myth] [Verse Three]
Ayo, look at what y'all made us do
Runnin' away with it like 18 wheelers downhill without no break shoes
You got a problem? I got one you can't equate to
LB + SFP which one you wanna take dude?
Like it equals of evidence of statutory rape
There's no escape
From the rise of the tide, changing the landscape
The flame of man never burned brighter
Rise like the spirits of the deceased
I'm something like a ghost writer
Stay on the rise like I'm transitioning from soul
Behind my worst flow, no colder than five
You scored to low, overdosin' my mind
So I'm noted in time when it is needed
Like water when you're weeded
A little bit of space will get meaning
Raise my head to the sky, hopin' my egos gets defeated
From N.C. to the D and all points in between it
It's all on you to rise if the fall gets repeated

[Hook]
It goes one for the money and two for the show
Three about to bring it and four to let you know
Rise
Cause we up here you need to look up
LB and SFP, the world is shook up
Just rise
Cause I can't wait
I can't wait
No I can't wait
Just rise
No I can't wait
I won't fake it
I can't wait
