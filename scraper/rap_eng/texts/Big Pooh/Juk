[Intro:]
Alright, alright, alright
Yea, yea

[Verse 1:]
Fact of d matter, be better you weak rapper
Unique speech pattern, achieved when d heat gather
Indeed it’s a fiche, puttin greens on ma platter
Not really sharing ma cuisine, I mean, where are ma manners
If you worthy to compete, I compete fo’ d raffers
Undefeated like the chief, say peace to ma detractors
Don’t keep following they lead, I mean keep ma mattress
So cold when I speak it makin ma teeth chatter
Shtick without the ‘c’ don’t get it mislabelled
Six is the dot when an cut d kids navels
Six inch cut he can’t fix wit witch hazel
Dip it in a crown wit little angel wit dim halo
Ready to die throwin lead in yo eye
D nigga penny off fetti they still on steady decline
They form, still in season boy I’m lettin them fly
Boom bye-bye to dem suckas ain’t no lettin them slide

[Chorus:]
Yaw, yaw, let me break d flow in
Brand new form ain’t no goin through d motions
Sack in d shattle, I’m shake rattlin an rollin
I hear dem snakes rattle they even travel in province
Yaw, yaw, let me break d flow in
Brand new form ain’t no goin through d motions
Sack in d shattle, I’m shake rattlin an rollin
I hear dem snakes rattle they even travel in province
Yaw, yaw

[Verse 2:]
They ain’t play me in the clubs I ain’t tryna make d people dance
I rather write a verse that will give ma people chance
Progress, process, pro romance
Yatte yattah like d renatta fiction novels
Feefo bottles like the ones with the nipples on it
Copycats copy tracks an do the same shit on it
Serve it up like it’s more than a seevy dinner
What they say see the chicken everybody’s winners
Makin money everybody grinners, innest, dissinest
The art stripped of its innocence
I’m tired of makin sense, I should be makin dollars
For makin dollars usually mean you ain’t makin cents
A million dreams where the fish is big
Yow, yow, understand d game is vicious, b
It takes time to see what I can see
That’s it’s real life monopoly, rap niggas property
Happy to pass ‘Go’, you don’t do business properly
Get dat 200 feelin like nobody stoppin me
They probably missed all d metaphors
They too busy watchin asses shakin to d floor

[Chorus]
