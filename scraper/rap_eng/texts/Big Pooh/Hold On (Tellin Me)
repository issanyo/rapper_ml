[Sample]
Sittin' on the edge of my mind all the time

[Big Pooh]
Look Ma
I wrote this with no hands
Naw, I'm playin'
Check it, I wrote this with no pens
A little flow to get the doors open
With your neck noddin' back like you drunk off Chopin
A lot of niggas quietly hopin'
I wouldn't return with the scope on them scopin'
But look niggas I'm here
Start chokin'
There's gonna be a lot of things said that's provokin'
Little dudes to get amp
Where you can get crushed like an ant
Turned out like a lamp
And take this mothafuckin' lick with a stamp
Do yourself a favor; don't fuck with the champs
Cause in any division
Whether that's, long or short on any decision
I'm gonna be the last standin'
Hand raised lookin' at the ref
You gonna ? count demandin'
For a rematch
But I cut out the beef
And guarantee you it won't be a relapse
Perhaps
In the crowd you can post up
Take a good look nigga
Get a close up
We froze up
Scrub niggas that rose up
Your run is over
Hand the fuckin' microphone up
I'm through with it
You can say I did it
I copped a squat on you lames then took a shitted
Whoa

[Hook: Big Pooh] + (Phonte) [x2]
People tellin' me, they tellin' me, "Hold on"
And I'm on the right track and nothin' can go wrong
But each day it's gettin' harder to hold on
(Man, I ain't hatin', I've been waitin' for so long)

[Phonte]
The realest to do it, the illest maneuvers, the plan
To finish you losers that's killin' the music, the man
That's known in every section
They say the deadliest weapon
Is Tay chillin' with a mic in the palm of his hand
He's savin' rap from it's hideous state
He never
Get's rattled in the city of snakes
One nigga say, "He don't rhyme as much"
I got the Midas touch
You Meineke niggas should give it a break
Cause I can relate to late nights
Rollin' in a dented Taurus
With my man
Bein' exposed to the cities horrors
Goin' to open mic nights
Where the audience, they did ignore us
But a lot of ill shit it had taught us
Like how to adapt to different people, different auras
And bring messages that our forefathers brought us
So even though I'm rappin' now and got thangs
I don't rock chains
Our ancestors did it for us
I'm on some, brand-new-and-improve
Phonte, 9th and Pooh on the move
I mean, who would have knew?
What our night time maneuvers would do
A whole state of MCs inspired
By the words we scribe
But some times I get quiet
And niggas think I'm depressed
I'm just analyzin'
I mean I'm strategizin'
I mean I'm fantasizin'
About all this money and stress
Because the taste of success is so tantalizin'
And some times I feel like a dope fiend without it
Wakin' up in cold sweats havin' dreams about it
Tryin' to tell my whole team about it
Y'all niggas got to walk it
My nigga, don't talk it just be about it
And this is what I'm faced with all the time
I'm not tryin' to be Rembrandt
Just wanna to draw the line
Between illusion and reality
And I'mma get what's mine
But I keep hearin' voices inside
They be tellin' me

Tellin' me...you ain't gonna make it man
What? It's my motherfuckin' life nigga. Uh, c'mon

[Hook]
