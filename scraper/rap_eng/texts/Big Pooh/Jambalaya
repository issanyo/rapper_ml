[Verse 1]
Half a score I reported you retorted
I'm the tortoise
You the hare
People stare when you care
Inviting fear listen here
I ain't fare
This a circle there's a square
Hear the swears from the squares pegging themselves as the present
Kings disassociate from peasants
Who should be impressed by the presence
I come baring gifts
Jumping off the proverbial cliff
Take a dip
Bitches strip for the chance to shake it good for a caretaker
Taking good care of niggas paper
They don't love you when you broke
When you holding bitches catch the vapors
Catch an L bumping "Rolling Papers"
Honey Jack no chasers please...do me no favors
Different flavors
Sweatpants pair of gators
These are players in the lobby of the Ponchartrain
Thinking I done gone insane
Throwing money all in vein
Pick it up
That's change
Knowing from this day forward I'll never be the same
Niggas know

[Hook]
Yo, I got it
Yo Yo I got it
Put it in a pot stir it up it's all logic
Yo, I got it
Yo Yo I got it
Put it in a bowl serve it up it's all profit
Yo, I got it
Yo Yo I got it got it

[Verse 2]
This is Hip Hop
Niggas wearing flip flops
Thinking they the shit cause they designer
Fucking prima dona's
I do this for wonder rhymers
Respect to the old timers
I'm the snake charmer
Comma
The one you don't want it with
Niggas scared to death
Who he running with?
Me
I don't need no cosign I'm like the government
Counting my coins
This is life depicted by Donald Goines
Feel sorry for the fruit of my loins
This the earth you inherit
Here's a carrot to the horses in the back
9th Wonder all over the track
Niggas know
This the glow of Bruce Leroy
Smashing all decoys
Regroup nah niggas here to recoup and destroy
I'm out of for everything
Money and the props
Pooh and 9th back to slangin' that dope
This red tops

[Hook]
Yo, I got it
Yo Yo I got it
Put it in a pot stir it up it's all logic
Yo, I got it
Yo Yo I got it
Put it in a bowl serve it up it's all profit
Yo, I got it
Yo Yo I got it got it
