(rapper big pooh)
Yeah, we going, got to some rock a little bit
Melo d

It's rapper! on my fat boy fresh shit (hah)

[Verse 1]

Its been a few short years, a lot raps latter/
Emotions up and down like they riding elevators/
Win baby win, ma said of the raiders/
You heard about the radio and how they wouldn't play us/
Heard about the videos and how they tried ho to slay us/
And played ya'll but most nigga still  don't get it/
I learnt early on i better always come with it/
There is somebody right now trying to out write me/
No clever lines not quite the mcee/
While some get confused coz i call my self rapper/
And the chit chatter [?] was a legal pad a Basquiat John Clarke wishing he was bad/
I am a leader i dont follow fags/
Melody my accomplice on the drum pads/
Break it bad, like i want the white/
A vergeie tims in the heat of nite/
Nah pooh he ain't playing right/ right

[Hook]
The nights look brighter than, than ever been before, yeaahh
And i am much higher, than i ever thought i could be yeaahh


[Verse 2]
They say time heals all, and wounds never close up/
Smile for the picture, while you bleeding in your close up/
Its surreal what your fork not, rocking the boat does/
Funny thing two relationships down the line/
I am a man i handle mine/
Blind sighted didn't see the signs/
But i am doing fine/
These two feet they were made for walking
Disappointed in it all, ain't no need for talking/
One hell of a fighter/
As each day passes the next gets brighter /
And so on and so on/
The show must go on/
Songs being made, rhymes being written there is a glass of lemonade/
Standing on a beach and i ain't searching  for the shade/
Feeling like a record, i see niggas trying to play me/
I think about it and the shit is crazy/
The situation going to change me/
Forever

[Hook]
The nights look brighter than, than ever been before, yeaahh
And i am much higher, than i ever thought i could be yeaahh

[Outro]
