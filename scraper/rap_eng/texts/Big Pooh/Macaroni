[Intro: Rapper Big Pooh] {X7}
Damn that feel good

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh] {X2}
I used to holler at hoes ever since I was young
I ain't have no tongue game so I ain't get none
Now I got a little paper so they throwing me some
Damn it feel good, yeah that feel good

Uhhhh...

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
"Shuckey Duckey Quack Quack"
Pooh been loving them hoes since way back
Back 'fore I was attacking the track I been that
A cool ass nigga, shy as hell, no mack
I had a little crush on this girl, yo fuck that
I had a huge crush on this girl, her ass fat
I was real young, still sprung
I was stunting tryna be the one
I went to work but I ain't get the job done
Light skin, long hair, spoke a different tongue
My Portuguese princess was playing hard young
Everyday I'd go and spit that game
Tryna put her pretty face in my frame but it was no haps
No mouthpiece, a nigga always had scraps
I'd grab her ass till I went and got a couple slaps
That's sixth grade, since then I got paid
Nowadays I keep 'em falling over Pooh all day

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh] {X2}

Uhhhh...

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
"Shuckey Duckey Quack Quack"
Pooh been loving them hoes since way back
Back 'fore I was attacking the track, I'm no mack
And by the time I reached high school, them broads they knew that
Screw that, I still had to take my shot
Hoping one would say yes and that shit would pop
I could get her to the crib where them panties would drop
Got shot down plenty but the kid don't stop ever
I'll be damned but shit, it rarely happen
A couple jump offs kept a nigga from the hand action
But that was guaranteed satisfaction
An easy nut, no sassing
Niggas you know what's up, yeah
But that was high school, Rapper Pooh no fool
Check how he got tight with his
Good job, got car, got house, no kids
Dial one-nine-hundred-big-pooh-4-biz, oh!

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh] {X2}

Uhhhh...

[Outro: Rapper Big Pooh]
Hell yeah it feel good
It should feel good to some of you niggas that's out there getting pussy now
Everybody ain't get pussy in high school
Everybody ain't get pussy when they was young
And that's real motherfucking talk, I ain't the only nigga out there
Y'knahmsayin? Everybody wasn't that nigga
Everybody wasn't popular and shit
Y'knahmsayin? Hoes turned you motherfuckers down! I know
