[Verse 1]
Its 10 o'clock, wakin' up for a new day
Another dollar, hit the block, gotta get paid
Spendin hours, movin rocks or blue-collar worker
Approached many times, proposition for a merger
T.T., an independent and he know the worth of
What he control is more than they had to offer
He scoffed at the idea of what they had to say
So Uptown, so T.T. to have it your way
We buy you out now, or take it later homie
T.T. told Uptown 'show me' and the beef was set
See somebody definitely gon' feel it
They gotta show the other who the realest, turn killers
They say sleep is the cousin of death
And nobody wanna die, so nobody getting rest
98 degrees, sun out scorchin
T.T. got gunned down on his mama porch drinkin' lemonade

[Hook]
I'm tryin to tell ya that the shit will drive you crazy
Take ya brotha, take ya son or ya baby
What I know now, is what this hood made me
Livin life in the Jungle

[Verse 2]
Gina had a gig watchin other peoples' kids
Trustworthy, but nobody checked the way she lived
Westside, Hampton Courts, Apartment 2K
Two kids already and a dude named Jay
Jay had some issues, a problem with his hands
He used to put 'em on Gina like she was a man
And that's problematic, always in the some static
He used to show his ass in front of kids a filthy habit
Gina had enough, she couldn't take the pain
She told Jay she bout to find herself a new man
She got a new plan, and a new focus
She don't need Jay no more and he know this
Meantime somebody's baby in the tub drownin
Jay in the bedroom on Gina poundin'
Face down the way she found him
Now they both doin fair time, I'm thinking she got life DAMN

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Homeboy he got dreams formulatin plans
Schemes on the other hand tryna get grands
Stick-up man in the hood, takin all ya grams
They remember when he wasn't ill, just Fam
Now he on a dolo mission
Graduated 86' Datsun to a brand-new Expedition
His team on the outside wishin
Lookin in with green eyes, it wasn't no surprise that
Solitude would be his downfall
He left his crew at the bottom so they gotta take him down pa
All he had to do was put em' on some game
Share a little bit, but he wanted all the fame
Cruisin' round the hood, perpin' hard, actin lame
Not knowin he gon' get it, it's a motherfuckin shame
Pulled up to the curb to show love to his man
Them boyz put two in his brain and called that shit even

[Repeat Hook]
