Where do we go from here?

[Verse One] [Elzhi]
Hopefully to the top, beneath the frame ock
Fallin' from the sky, similar to rain drops
Tryin' to make a little heat, keep the flame hot
Product of the D, kinda got a little name huh
Niggas wanna be the three up in my lane now
Two years ago they treat me like a stranger
Cloud upon my head but it's probably daze now
Truth pays when I jot it down on the page now
Groupies, want me all between the legs now
Truthfully, it's kinda good to make them beg times
Two, only real one's on my team who
Knew, I found a way to make my dreams come
True, anyway I'm foreign, floorin' it
In a Porsche, orange girl's face that gorgeous
+Movin' On Up+ like Georges
Niggas lookin' Weezy
Cause the S make it look easy

"I'm out to get it"
"Gotta set it straight before you twist the facts"

Where do we go from here?

[Verse Two] [Phonte]
Ayo
Say I'm on a force
And if not a verse then I'm on a chorus
SV so nice LB bring it back
That Old Spice, "Look bitch, I'm on a horse"
Whores all in front of me like I'm on The Source
Then them inside out like Diana Ross
They takin' pictures
Tay, spit the illest lines south of the Mason Dixon
That you don't wanna cross

[Big Pooh]
Yo
To the sky is where I'm gonna dog
Above the clouds and that bullshit pursuin' y'all
Plenty of niggas, pray and pray on my downfall
Flashing rent, thank you haters, you are too involved
Nahh, they lovin' Pooh cause they crew is soft
Never see me sweat youngin', this is R&R
We are by far greater than you ever was
You know the name, ain't nobody comin' close to us
