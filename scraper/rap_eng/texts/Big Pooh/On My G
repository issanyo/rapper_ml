Uh, I'm still honing my craft
A lot of muh'fuckers hate, thank you for the laughs
Lukewarm, somebody's big ass
Drunk off emotion, man up 'fore you crash
Life's about what happens in your dash
Live for tomorrow, no regrets for your past
I'm on the floor, too close to bitch ass
I ain't tryna talk bidness, fall back bitch ass
Yeah, I ain't gon' say it again
