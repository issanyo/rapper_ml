[O-Dash]
Yeah, hear Dash
Yo, ready to let you know
It's your boy O-Dash man, yaknahmsayin?
Y'all motherfuckers better stop sleeping out here
Nah, don't do that
You better wake the fuck up for real
Open your eyelids
Big Pooh, Nicolay

It's the League's Tracy McGrady, faggots gonna hate me (huh)
Puttin up MVP numbers, spittin 12 months this summer
Emanate, and watch cowards imitate
How I demonstrate how words supposed to penetrate
Punks mad at O cause they can't get a date - nigga wait
Give me a second to get it straight
Haters see me in pub - want my shit
See my rasta bitches and want my dick
That's a homo, that's why I don't deal with em no more
Bunch of Dr. Evils tryna steal a nigga mojo
In the safe got dough (uh huh), claim he got flow
By the fifteenth I'm like "Yo, where your dough go?"
I see, I see, in other words, you're so-so
Hate O for movin blocks of coco for dough, no?
Fast breakin the drought, fuck a T-O
Coach told me to shoot whenever in doubt
D-League got the components to be dissected
Game over, now train your style so eclectic
Comin through beneath radars, undetected
Twenty bars of perfection to be respected, nigga!
