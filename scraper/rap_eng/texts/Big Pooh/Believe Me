[Verse One] [Sha Stimuli]:
I don’t know where to begin
Without spending it’s hard to get spins
So if your computer’s not on, then the spot that I start at is right where I’ll end
The only time I pushed a Benz was when the transmission died and I was riding wit my mens
If I ain’t do music with the people that I do it with, the truth is, I wouldn’t have friends
Some of my mixtapes were sloppy
I don’t think my burner has any bodies
My album, it sold more copies than the label even thought and I showed that nothing can stop me
I been doing this mad long
I wouldn’t say I made bad songs
Maybe weak verses or the track wrong
Some people thought that I was blackballed
See, I was driving in my own lane
Some other rappers had an EZ pass
These dudes snatched off my gold chain
Thought they was trying to R.I.P my ass
Busting shots that ain’t aim at me
I laughed at these young thug little guys
I was feeling flattered that they came at me
I asked ‘em if they knew my name was Stimuli
Critics gon’ say I’m missing arrogance
But I ain’t got no Mrs. I ain't married yet
And I ain’t got no kids so when you average that
I sacrificed my life so u can have these tracks

[Hook]:
You gotta believe me
I swear that you gotta believe me
Somebody say
"What I tell you is true...believe me"

[Verse Two] [Sha Stimuli]:
I won 2 awards for being underground
And every year I say "I’m not going back!"
But when I get nominated I come around
Chasing that cheese gets you caught in traps
My friends say that I should make a party song
I told ‘em that my life is not a party yet
I’m looking at this mission that I started on
"Rest when you die" is what my father said
And he worked ‘til his last day
With Marlboro ashes in the ashtray
I was trying to fight the stupid sad face
But I still teared
I really feel fear that my momma might go, before I make her life so
Much better must get a mansion or nice home nuff cheddar, plush leather
Furniture inside of it, so she could be proud as shit
Thank you for riding wit me
Used to hit the club wearing sweatpants
No haircut, hiding it with headbands
All my girls I made sadder than Nets fans
Had special powers, always the X-Man/ex-man

[Hook]:
You gotta believe me
I swear that you gotta believe me
Somebody say
"What I tell you is true...believe me"

[Verse Three] [Big Pooh]:
They say I shouldn't have been a rapper
Even momma kept asking about school and life after
Some of my friends had doubts
Guess your math got sloppy when you tried to count me out niggas
Round peg square hole
I could never be a star, I don't wear the right clothes
I don't wear enough chains, even got a funny name
Things went wrong and I too take blame
Me and my brother stay beefing
At times I think he likes starting shit for no reason
My life was in a spiral, down hill, cloudy forecast, no survival
Revival of the fittest like a nigga eating spinach
Glue ? I was cast as an appendage
I would never make it by myself, need help
I guess Little Brother ending wasn't good for my image
I don't say what they want to hear
If I went on 106 the crowd wouldn't cheer
I don't smoke enough weed, I don't drink enough beers
I ain't prove myself to y'all the past nine years
I'm the rock...solid
Cornerstone, pain relief medicine
A little bit of Cordizone
Step aside the people they don't want to clone
I'm doing this for me
VA's very own

[Sha Stimuli]
Believe what you see
If you blink you may not get it, I dream when I ain’t sleep
I wanna be a wake ‘cause at my wake I won’t be me any more
Just a corpse with my spirit roaming free, help
I’ll shine but I might not make it rain
My club song was fast but I was talking about my pain
I tossed a couple quarters out when I was on the stage
People said I made it drizzle, I thought I was throwing change
"It’s a metaphor y’all" I explained
But they didn’t wanna hear it now I’m looking in the mirror
At a person that’s reversing his purpose
Like clean versions of verses without curses
If you searching for perfect, look
It’s more than rapping and flows
I’m a documentary disguised as a reality show

It’s more than rapping and flows
I’m a documentary disguised as a reality show
Damn, that’s the way you gotta package it so you survive in the game
The truth with a li/lie in my name
