[Intro]
You're a very special part of my life
And I know my heart would never be free

[Hook x2]
Listen, I got a story to tell
These women on the corner with pussy for sale
This making me wait ain't going too well
You making me wait got me horny as hell

[Verse 1]
Yo, are we fucking or not?
Yeah, I got to ask before I come to the spot
Cuz I'm spending gas money and it's gettin' me hot
Talking about making out and shit
I'm a little too old for dry humpin'
I either get to come inside or I ain't comin'
It's nothin'
What you talkin' about 90 days?
That nigga Steve Harvey crazy
If I ain't getting it here
So what I liked it girl, I'mma get it somewhere
Be clear, of everything that I'm sayin'
Neither one of us in a position to be playin'
So when I come through, you gon' come too
Fuck Steve Harvey girl what you tryna do?
Yo, let me get a stink finger then
What you think about just putting the tip in?
We go together no sex stop trippin'
It ain't like you a virgin so quit bullshittin'
Probably got some good pussy just babysittin'

[Hook x3]

[Outro]
Listen, I got a story to tell
These women on the corner with pussy for sale
This making me wait ain't going too well
You making me wait got me horny as hell
Steve Harvey
