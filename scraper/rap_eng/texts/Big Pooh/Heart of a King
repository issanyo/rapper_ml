Yeah. Look

(Chorus)
Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

[Verse 1: Dee-1]
Yo. Yo. Yo
Press record, spit the heat, you know how we do it
Put this song on repeat, make a million to it
Sitting back, reminiscing bout the old days
Spent the whole day, reminiscing bout the old days
It's not a secret, we keep it G'r than y'all
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the realest of ‘em all?
Your reality ain't real, so you ain't real at all
You robbing Peter to pay Paul, you Ray Charles
Opposite of mission vision, intuition AWOL
Blind to reality, ya whole life a fallacy
Actually, these dudes too emotional for me
Don't email, or text me your frustrations my G
All that passive aggressiveness, ain't my style
Save the drama for ya mama dawg, you ain't my child
Look, there's no 'I' in team, that's why yo team blind
There's two eyes in mission that why this vision fine

(Chorus)
Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

[Verse 2: Dee-1]
Look
It started off in dorm room 309, now Dee-1 global
So come and look into the mind of a young mogul
Trying to do business fair in this frigid air
Cold world, heater broken, technicians rare
The hood need brain food, cause all the kitchen’s bare
Jordan’s is fly, but don’t die tryna get a pair
My heart bleeding on these beats, pass the Band-Aid
Matter fact cut the beat off, I don’t need no band aid
I act paid, cause I’m rich
But the currency ain’t man made
That’s why they trying to stop my shine, like a lamp shade
Believe I mean it, if I say it
When they hear me, they go to throwing them red flags
Cause in a instant, they replay it
When the people want it, haters are irrelevant
And you can’t overturn they call, cause you got inconclusive evidence
I can’t deny I’m blessed, that’s cause the heart of a warrior beats inside my chest
Yes. Yes. Yes

(Chorus)
Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

[Verse 3: Rapper Big Pooh]
Rapper!
Uhh! I got the heart of a lion
Praying on my downfall quit trying
Applying every lesson I was taught to every battle I had fought
Supplying me with nerves, like iron
Ice cold veins, the memory remains
When I would ask my mama, why don’t we have nice things
She told me I was fed, with the roof over head
Her most important duty, is to make sure I’m prepared
N's don’t play fair, they tend to change like the weather do
And leave behind in they absence, certain residues
Knock you off schedule, bullsh— perpetual
Then get uptight, when they think you got a better view
I just pulled ahead of you, with blinders on
While you use ya brawn, I’ma use my brain
Therefore I have changed
People believe whatever they gon’ believe
A king is how I should be perceived, Forever

(Chorus)
Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it

Whether they know it or not, we running this thing
I don't know what they got, but I got the heart of a king
This is not for the simple minded
Cause when it's this real, you can't deny it
