[Intro: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah, Rapper Big Pooh
Phonte, Dynas, 9th Wonder's on production
Another LB function
Topshop where we at, you know the tune
Yeah, check it, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
For the right price, you can get quite nice
That's how they do life right now in the D
Scallywags selling P for free, when I hop in the V
Do they think bidness back to the street?
On the hunt for they master beat with the glass dick
It's a shame what they do for that next hit
And every move is so drastic
I'm talking bout prom queens who turned into has-beens
Like this chick named Mia
Shorty was the shit in high school, every broad had to be her
Walking down the hall, every dude had to gee her
Rocked the new shit, Diesel shoes, no sneakers
Hair kept tight, French tips fresh
Everything she did, Mia was the best
Until graduation day, life turned to mess
Her pops took two to the chest over dope money
Now the family's broke, moms turned to Bourb' and Coke
Tryna numb the pain, Mia never came to grips with it
Going through flicks then ripping them shits before she'd get drunk with it
In the streets, no faction
Snow became her fashion, riding through, no passion
Now old classmates laugh while they passing
Because she gone in the wind, and that's what happens

[Hook: Phonte] {X2}
I seen storms, sunshowers and rain
Just as sure as the sky's blue and the seasons change
A lot of people use chemicals to ease the pain
There's gotta be more, I'm tryna go deeper mayne

[Verse 2: Dynas]
I wanna tell the church where the works of the devils appear
Why the blonde haired, blue eyed Jesus gazes and stare
I'm from the ghetto where they braided his hair, slum raiding the square
We found love when he made it appear
Pastor told me drop dough and my soul would be clear
And I believed him, he purchased a (?) this year
As if my life will be spared if I start giving
No details, just told your boy I was not Christian
The plot thickens when he revoked my baptism
Repo'd my black vision, man of the cloth who tortured black women
Said the Bible wasn't mine, but found the time
To stack riches, steady asking for my tide
Many men claim they bang they head
Turn off your T-N-N and run tell your friends
Ain't no salvation in the message he said
I could never comprehend, now the title of being born again
Could help me lose my friend
We used to chill but now I can't talk to them
Claiming we not equal, thought we was all God's people?
Questioning my faith and where I stand as a man
So now my home is my church, and Dynas, he only worship with the fam

[Hook: Phonte] {X2}
I seen storms, sunshowers and rain
Just as sure as the sky's blue and the seasons change
A lot of people use religion to ease the pain
There's gotta be more, I'm tryna go deeper mayne

[Verse 3: Phonte]
This is the last stop, last chance, last train to greatness
Last pain I take within my own chance
For Hip Hop, I feel I got to take a strong stance
I'm sick of that bullshit, hell I'm a grown ass man
I had to sit back, think, pause and recline
Gain a sense of myself while I'm caught in the grind
I could just throw some words together and call it a rhyme
But I'm tryna change the world eight bars at a time
That's what deep thoughts will do to you kid
Have you thinking bout existence and how hard it usually is
I'm kinda young but I ain't new to the biz
Just wanna hear my beats knock like past opportunities did
Phonte still burning it - rhymes so ahead of his time
I reminisce and see future occurrences
Thoughts ain't deep like mine? Y'all niggas should turn it in
Respect in the game, muh'fucker we earning it, word up

[Hook: Phonte] {X2}
I seen storms, sunshowers and rain
Just as sure as the sky's blue and the seasons change
A lot of people write rhymes to relieve the pain
There's gotta be more, I'm tryna go deeper mayne

[Outro: Phonte]
It's like that y'all
The fly shit y'all
We don't miss y'all
