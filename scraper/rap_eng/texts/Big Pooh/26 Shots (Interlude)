"Yo.. why was I just over here thinking about my damn 26th birthday?
You remember that? I had the BRILLIANT idea of taking 26 shots
Didn't even make it all the way! By 23, people was just passing me WATER
In this damn shot glasses, talkin 'bout 'Here, here, it's vodka, it's vodka!'
Man, all I remember.. from that night
Was you ending up having to take me home.. and on the ride
I went from laughing, damn crying, boo-hooing
Then... get to my girl's house.. and wanted to fight-ed..
Some nigga that was outside.. you tellin me to shut the fuck up
And then when I get to the house, I didn't really care about my girl no mo'
All I was askin for was the damn dog.. ehehehehe!
Well... turned out that I peed in the bed
Thinkin I was in the bathroom... yeah, not a good look"
