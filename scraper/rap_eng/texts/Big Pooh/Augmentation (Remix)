[Verse 1]
Beat box, this is back to the block
Before every rapper sold rocks
Before everybody needed rocks in they watch
Just watch, now, it's all about boardrooms and stocks
Words paint pictures, I'm an artist non-stop
Raw beats, raps, this is called Hip-Hop
Only way I flop is belly first in a pool
People talk brand talk to a appear cool
Learn to follow rules, I'm a man first, fool
Get schooled, chalk it all up to business, being shrewd
No guidelines, you're an outline, food
Sharks in the water, this is what you wanna do
For me, this is like breathing, blood in the veins
Muscle on the bone, we are not the same
I rap to make change, you rapping for the change
Scraps and Cadillacs, go ahead and do your thang

[Hook - Chopped samples]
Over the global, my vocals be travelling
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
I'm the flavor
Over the global, my-my-my my vocals be travelling
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me

[Verse 2]
Gossip sites is where you go to get your raps from
Forbes magazine aspire to be number 1
But no rapper gonna make it to that top layer
You a nigga now and was before you got here
Spare the hard feelings, this is dope dealing
Enough rope for you to choke yourself, easy killing
Call it hands free, youngin', ask for me
I'm on the balcony, hands gripping the pump
See how being drunk off the ego will skew the mind, limited view
A theater near you displays every dream until it seems that it's true
Cointelpro, they infiltrated the crew
Then throw us in a jail operated like a zoo
I'm just reminding you of things you already knew
From that project concrete, a rose grew
But we only see the weeds in our view

[Hook - Chopped samples]
Over the global, my vocals be travelling
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
I'm the flavor
Over the global, my-my-my my vocals be travelling
I'm the flavor
Words of wis-wisdom
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
