You don't ever have to worry, cause I'll never go too far
Don't want you to change because that's not who you are
Baby, you can be a star {*4X*}
Heeeey

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Tommy Lex is his Lexus, black on beige
Hard bottoms mean, keep hat on waves
Lightly staunched shirt in my hollywood shades
Going 5 in the lot, got to see both ways
I'm not that nigga that you used to
Who's the dude in all black? It's the Rapper Big Pooh
Cup in my hand son, doing what I do
It's hard to do right, yeah the saying is true
Never the killer 'fore I knew who I knew
So I get dappered up for the women that blew
Their chance, to dance with a nigga
Now they all double back cause the rep grew bigger
Tigga, they don't know my style
Saw the left profile and them hoes went wild
I'm the fat man's poster child
I see they tryna get a closer look at me now, ow!

[Hook: unknown vocalist] + (Phonte)
You don't ever have to worry, cause I'll never go too far (I'm right here)
Don't want you to change because that's not who you are (and what we tell 'em now?)
Baby, you can be a star (and what we tell 'em now?)
Baby, you can be a star (I say we tell 'em now)
Baby, you can be a star (that's what we tell 'em now)
Baby, you can be a star (I'm tryna tell 'em now)
Heeeey

I took you out of that bar, took you out of that bra
Two months later took you out of that job you hated
You gave my life a new cause, took me away from them broads
Now I'm smiling cause it seems we finally made it
A missed period, yep we finally made it
A little boy or little girl's our first creation
It was worth the wait and although
You the best thing in my life, I'm still scared and I hate to say it
Cause even though I rock banger after banger
For Tom, Dick and Harrys, that ain't half as scary
As looking down and seeing that ring on my finger
I'm still committed, just let me work through my hangups
My thoughts be unravelling nigga
No I ain't the first cat to have shakes or premarital jitters
But she been holding me down, wearing her crown
So she like "fuck that, take me to the magistrate nigga"
Hah, and I can live with that, and I can understand it
Cause truth be told, it ain't another woman on this planet
That I would want to share a piece of my heart
For better or for worse, girl I'm taking you to the top

Cause you a star (you a star)
Yes you are (yes you are)
A superstar (a superstar)
That's what you are (that's what you are)
A superstar (a superstar)
That's what you are (that's what you are)
Shining bright for the world to see
Give it to me, c'mon

[Hook: unknown vocalist] + (Phonte)
You don't ever have to worry (c'mon), cause I'll never go too far (I'm right here girl)
Don't want you to change because that's not who you are (and what we tell 'em huh?)
Baby, you can be a star (that's what we tell 'em now)
Baby, you can be a star (that's what we tell 'em now)
Baby, you can be a star (I mean we tell 'em now)
Baby, you can be a star
Heeeey (c'mon)
