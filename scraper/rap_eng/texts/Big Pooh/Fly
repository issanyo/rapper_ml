[Intro: Rapper Big Pooh]

If you talking bout living
Then you talking bout me
People talking bout giving
Experience ain't free
Ya know, that's what they talk about
So I tell em this

[Verse 1: G-Beanz]

I wake up with a plan a path to take
Learn from my mistakes keep patient raise the stakes
I was born and raised living on the food stamps
Same meal on my plate same food banks
Got a little older spent some time in jail
2 years probation I'm paying still
Got into popping pills shit got to real
To numb to feel I let go of the wheel
I ask god to watch over mom and pops
Almost gave up my future was the pine box
Scatter brained piece the blocks
Follow my life from the bottom to the top
Look at myself in the mirror I see a better man
See a clear picture a new stance
Take a glance at the past it's over now
I'm a grown ass man I'm older now

[Hook}

Been fighting all my life
Finally made it right
I have found a place where i can truly shine
I've wasted so much time
I made up my mind
Doing what it take so I can truly fly

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]

I'm from a place where
If you can make it out of there
You can make it anywhere
Those same things I dreamed about as a kid
Some I really did, yo son i really lived
From the page to the stage family members in a cage
So I'm trying to help my mama but I'm running short on paper
I'm like here kitty kitty when things are going well
All them well wishes with me
Niggas out to get me was the motto
But my mindset was set on models and the throttle
Purely aspiration no imagination chasing
Time to let go of all them thoughts and hit the lotto
Place my foot in front of the other and soon I'll be discovered
Uncovered like titties in the morning yawning
Waking up I'm still storming my life's on track
They ain't made a movie that competes with that you know

[Hook}

Been fighting all my life
Finally made it right
I have found a place where i can truly shine
I've wasted so much time
I made up my mind
Doing what it take so I can truly fly
Fly, Fly, Fly, Fly, Oh Fly
Fly, Fly, Fly, Oh Fly


[Verse 3: H.Hunter]

The places in my head all spin together
In storms staying strong forever
From just moms no father
Playing the streets raw to fiends tossing 20's
Like beads at mardi gras
Riding in my city paying the token
Left holding but moving performing on stage
Leaving 12's smoking, focus, 3 kids close to, music
Jumping over fences, uhh lyrical glimpses
Got them looking at my passion, relentless
You feel the soul of hunter in every sentence
My dudes in the hood reminders of where we come from
Citi Lightz looking over the slums on this one
Days still pour out liquor where am i from the missing
But never forgotten like bin laden
Bury me in youth cause i was born rotten
Cause i was born rotten
Watch the stars


[Hook}

Been fighting all my life
Finally made it right
I have found a place where i can truly shine
I've wasted so much time
I made up my mind
Doing what it take so I can truly fly
Fly, Fly, Fly, Fly, Oh Fly
Fly, Fly, Fly, Oh Fly
