[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Pushers and politicians often move with the same rhythm
You speak of government, my thoughts are cynical
So, while we're focused on the pinnacle
They getting paid off everything they label criminal
They not overturning then sentences, pouring in remembrance
Dream of Americana, no 'semblance to what they know
Liquor in the cup watching curbs grow
My man gave me 2, he's trying to stack 4
See plenty dough, like a pizza shop
Got preachers buying jets, stealing from their flock
Pop, pop, lost innocence
Pouring in remembrance
Praying for us sinners, no difference between the two
Fountain of youth for the chosen few
Want to control the population, poisoning the food
We got money for wars, can't feed the poor
2pac was on to something, maybe more but we'll never know

[Hook]
Eyes wide open, Lord, and I can't see
This is for the people, right?
Eyes wide open, Lord, and I can't see
Wonder how they sleep at night
Eyes wide open, Lord, and I can't see
But it's for the people, right?
Eyes wide open, Lord, and I can't see

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
I'm spitting Alex Jones with immortal technique
Infowars [?] from the sheikhs
Love's going to get you, manipulate the feature though
Barack should have brought your ass home a week ago
Love decided by the color of skin
Love subverted by the need to fit in
Society, why are we watching CNN
The White House put me back to sleep again
Hatred killed another unarmed black
Hard to land on my feet like a one-armed cat
We dying, Mr. President, you're lying, Mr. President
If Heaven got a hot spot, you're frying, Mr. President
Democrat, Republican, push the same agenda
Global euthanasia by United Nation members
Insomniac, don't be mad at me
I see the knife, put your hands where my eyes can see
Wide open

[Hook]
