[Verse One] [Masta Ace]
Jumped in a Yukon GMC
Then I hit the block like T-N-T
And just like C&C
I drive a Music Factory
Actually
I show the block some love, it shows it right back to me
Drivin' hands free on the celly
I'm no fool, low fuel, I'm cool like Fonzarelli
Seats all the way back to the last notch
One hand on my crotch, it's a nice day to ass watch
Seem Sima, two dimes and a Beamer
Who am I?
On my way down to Do Or Die
I get Apocalypse
We see a shorty with a lot of hips
Skin tight jeans and some Prada kicks
Beep beep
We stop in the middle of the street
Double park the jeep
See if she speak
The picture I'm paintin' is so graphic
On my way to scoop Punchline, there's no traffic

[Hook] [Big Pooh]
Road clear, high speed, 80 degrees
Switch lanes, window down feelin' the breeze
Ladies out
Green all the way, had to stop hardly
The Alpine turn the streets to a block party
Outside the deli
Kids playin' skelly
Old folks reminisce, hustlers on cellys
Full tank of gas, places to be
Got to go, more people to see
There's no traffic

[Verse Two] [Punchline]
Lookin' at chicks to pass the time
Her grill's twisted, look how her ass design? (Holla!)
Gave me her number, I passed her mine
Told her I rhyme
Call me up after nine
At that time
Ace pulled up in the ride
Two beeps then I hopped in the passenger side
We bumpin' that EMC shit
We peepin'
Chicks in places and spots we most frequent
Day is different
Get a cut from Doug in the 'ville
Bout to cop some kicks it's flight club
Show love
Get a dog and a drink
This day is sweeter, than a thug rockin' pink
Hot day
It's fun in the sunshine
Music loud, no beef with one time
See a chick with some hips and thick thighs
I invite her to the show tonight
Now let's ride

[Hook] [Big Pooh]
Road clear, high speed, 80 degrees
Switch lanes, window down feelin' the breeze
Ladies out
Green all the way, had to stop hardly
The Alpine turn the streets to a block party
Outside the deli
Kids playin' skelly
Old folks reminisce, hustlers on cellys
Full tank of gas, places to be
Got to go, more people to see
There's no traffic

Verse Three [Big Pooh]
Yeah
Ace call me up about a week ago
Told me come to NY cause he's havin' a show
So I put Tay on the plan, a week went past
Filled up the whip with gas
Let's ride
Who ready for the trip, rear speakers on lean
It's a sunny day, gotta get the car clean
Wipe down the grill and shine the spokes
Car culture homie, ain't no joke
Let's roll

[Phonte]
Let's go cause me and my wiz
Been arguin', cause she and the kids
Been botherin' me
So I'mma take this trip
Give us some space
Watch my man Ace perform 'Me & The Biz'
With the rest of EMC, NYC gang
Wildin' out up in BB Kings
An hour later, niggas can't wait to eat these wings
We gotta have it
On our way to Skylight Diner there's no traffic

[Hook] [Big Pooh]
Road clear, high speed, 80 degrees
Switch lanes, window down feelin' the breeze
Ladies out
Green all the way, had to stop hardly
The Alpine turn the streets to a block party
Outside the deli
Kids playin' skelly
Old folks reminisce, hustlers on cellys
Full tank of gas, places to be
Got to go, more people to see
There's no traffic
