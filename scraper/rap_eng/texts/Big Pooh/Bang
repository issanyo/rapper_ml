[Hook: HaLo]
It's like the bomb's last bang
It's feeling like the bomb's last bang
It's feeling like the bomb's last bang
The pull back point
What it do, what are you
Got to prove that joint

[Verse 1: Big Remo]
My prayers get longer by the day
One for all the youngin round the way poundin pavement
That grave yard shift shit
Made in Winston, brave heart spirit
Two times for the resident in federal penitentiaries
Babies and babies mammas who barely could eat
With no families to help em so they marry the streets
Baby daddy carry heat like he got a disease
He told her...he out to eat like a savagin beast
And his cabinets is bare as can be
And he barely can breath
And I been there but that was in 2003
Battling asthma wit Maalik, it wakes him out of his sleep
And that remind me of me, and that was 1983
My dad would bring medicine and something to drink
We grab hands when the family eat
Everyone of us, me...I pray for clarity
Peace prosperity
In 2014 ima bleed for everything. The bang nigga

[Verse 2: Big Remo]
And I'm still down to kick it wit the homies from the hood
If I could I put on each and all my homies in the hood
Like I had to get mines homie you should get yours
And stop focusing on what a nigga drivin thru the hood
Ima survivor of the violence
Product of my environment
Who somehow made it out
I seen my shot and took a shot at it
Id hope that you be proud of me. Your kids prolly admire me
If not I know they mommas be, she used to always ride the D
Harsh reality I like to call it honesty
But spoken modestly
I understand why momma be wildin and on her knees in her feelins
She say my words a double edged sword and it's blood on the mirror
I'm not a killer nor a dealer
But they hatin I can feel it, and that's bad for the spirit
For she rest at night she whisper to The Lord
Please don't let these haters take em that's my boy
With a dream and he explored it and niggas ain't supportin it
That bang nigga
