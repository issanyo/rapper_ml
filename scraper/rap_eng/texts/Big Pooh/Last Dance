[Verse 1 – Rapper Big Pooh]
Ay yo, I got me a call
Matter fact at first I got me a deal
Then I bought my first car, if we just keeping it real
My nigga [?] made arrangements, I’m stuck with the payments
Now I’m cruising down [?], I’m nothing to play with
You see, the women staring at
Bitches, they don’t care I’m fat
Long as the pockets match the stomach, then they where I’m at
Niggas at the club, blowing hundreds at the bar
Everybody whispering, tryna find out who I are
I’m a motherfucking star, in my mind and my climb
Dedicated to the grind so I deserve to shine
Now I’m tripping on west coast, tricking on some west hoes
Hundreds at the Bungalow room, buying the best clothes
Looking at these sneakers I ain’t ever put a foot in
My conscious heckles me on my shoulder, like I shouldn’t
A couple months in I sprinted through 6 figures
Now uncle sam calling, I ain’t talking to that nigga
I’m broke, my nigga I’m broke

[Hook – BJ The Chicago Kid]
Every time you get your chance to dance
You got to make sure it’ll last forever
Cause you never know your next chance to dance again
So you better make sure it lasts forever
Every time you get your chance to dance (ay yo, let em know)
Every time you get your chance to dance (ay yo, let em know)

[Verse 2 – Rapper Big Pooh]
They asking where I been
In a hole, tryna dig myself out of it
Smiling when you see me, on the inside cry a bit
Downfall obvious, pain be the lobbyist
Asking for the easy way out, I thought of quitting
Disappearing from the public, no negotiating budgets
Or dealing with these niggas operating like puppets
Get a job, get a dog, love your wife, and I’m gone
Checkmate, game over, live the life of a pawn
Till I think about them late night studio sessions
Taking trips around the globe, a constant chase of perfection
Eating crepes out in Paris, [?] out in London
See me in the streets at the crib, these niggas fronting
Ain’t a something when you down and out
Clarity is finding out
Niggas really ready to ride, and ones that’s hiding out
I believe in fate, this is why I have faith
That whatever I deserve is sure to come my way
And you know, and you know

[Hook][x2]
