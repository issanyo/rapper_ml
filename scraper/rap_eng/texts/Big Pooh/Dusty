[O-Dash]
They say Hip Hop's dead, well I can resuscitate
We getting bread homeboy, you better get a plate
Then we so controversial, starting to sound commercial
Thought talking money's universal

[Rapper Big Pooh]
They say I'm young, black and angry, niggas can't tame me
Never had a habit doing shit that ashamed me
Say I gotta change be, careful what you ask for
You don't want it with a nigga when he come through that door

[O-Dash]
Pooh come with it, shit I'm coming with the fo'-fo'
All glow like a fiend, eyes at the corner sto'
Looking for snow in the middle of August
Diamond in the rough boy, spitting that flawless
Never been a coach, still running with ballers

[Rapper Big Pooh]
You know I'mma bar spit, PSA what you call us
Beat kinda grainy, Rapper Pooh spit heartless
Land of the dead where these niggas run lawless, uh

[Hook]
You know we tell it like it is right?
Talk shit till these pussy niggas wanna fight
Sleep days, making moves under moonlight
"Niggas mad because I know that cash rules" --] Notorious B.I.G
Yeah, you know we tell it like it is right?
Talk shit till these pussy niggas wanna fight
Sleep days, making moves under moonlight
HOJ is the crew right?

[O-Dash]
This ain't just hype, two niggas with mics
Gun talk, off safety, we ain't too pussy to fight

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Aiyyo you muh'fuckin right, I don't claim to be
Cause I am who I am, pretty soon you gon' see

[O-Dash]
Guess it is what it is then, we can shoot the five
Been deprived so long, just lucky to be alive
Won't be survived by our wife and sons

[Rapper Big Pooh]
They know I won't be removed from the space till I'm done
The undisputed one, pound for pound, second round
They say third time's a charm, I'm liking how it sound

[O-Dash]
Haters wipe me down from my fitted to my shoes
Been paying my dues, brud' check the interviews

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Cause I'm on, niggas I keep being on the cusp
Been blazing trails, been leaving dust

[O-Dash]
Now we on the road to riches and finer things
Foreign cars, pulling stacks out our jeans like 'bling'
