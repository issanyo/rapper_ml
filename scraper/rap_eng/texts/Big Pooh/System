[Phonte]
We all got our demons (Ohh, ohhh, OHH, OHH-ohh, ohh)
Forgive me..uh! Let's go!

[Hook: Tone Trezure]

Was the lovin good last night? - Ba-BAAAAY, I gotta I gotta (The real, UH!)

[Phonte]
UH! - She thinks it's all in her jeans
But it ain't her, it's just all in my genes
Lookin at my fam now I see just what it means
Mom don't like kids but Pop like makin 'em
So myself now, I better understand
A nigga don't smoke or don't drink but
Grandma used to said, "You gon' do SOMETHIN to smell like man"
So I try to fight temptation but the shit gets harder
She moves in closer and the dick gets harder
I try to fight the feelin cause she's, so appealin
But these hoes take to me like a fish to water
It's shouldn't be that hard, thought I'd change
But my mind is like, "You ain't came that far"
Huh, it's like Adam walkin out on Eve
Only to see the appletree is fillin his backyard
It feels wrong, but so right
And it's not fair, my dear, but that's life
The life I'm livin
It seem like the devil took a piss in my gene pool
Me? Family man? - Who the fuck am I kiddin?
I look into the eyes of my seeds
Hopin they grow up to be much better than me
I can't keep livin under these sick guidelines
Lord, please help me keep walkin the fine line
Until I can find mine, uh!

[Hook: Tone Trezure]
I can't get you out of my system - NOOOOO, don't go away
Wait a minute, stop and listen - cause I-iiiiiiiigh, need to know, baby
Was the lovin good last night? - Ba-BAAAAY, I gotta I gotta
I gotta have ya here tonight - tonight, yeah yeah

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I've been at work all day, boss in the back
Gettin fat, take that, I'm at minimal pay
I'm a sucker to the clock, when I get home
I'mma suck unto the bottle of Patron out the box
Remy on the rocks, gon' try to take me
To go to the +Doctor,+ I need +Detox+
No Peace Scnapps, nigga I'm a man
Flip Merriot with the shots, think I'm three down
Since I ain't sure I ordered another round
Pooh an alcoholic, how that sound?
Found peace in the spirits, ma tried to tell me
"Slow down" plenty times, but I just didn't hear it
So I fifth geared it, reared its ugly head
Man FUCK, I was so misled
How you gon tell the world that it got you scared?
You supposed to be the man, can't bring home bread
Make it 5:15, families don't get fed
Livin check by check, never gettin ahead
That's life, makin it hard to come home
So I'm at the bar where the stool's my throne - it's ON!!

[Hook: Tone Trezure w/ Phonte]
I can't get you out of my system - NOOOOO, don't go away
Wait a minute, stop and listen - cause I-iiiiiiiigh, need to know, baby
Was the lovin good last night? - Ba-BAAAAY, I gotta I gotta
I gotta have ya here tonight - tonight, yeah yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
