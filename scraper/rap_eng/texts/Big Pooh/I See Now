[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah, 9th Wonder on the beat
I can't front man, you got some hot beats
It's your boy Kanye To The
Got Consequence in here (I see now), Little Brother (I see now)
Yeah, I want y'all to listen
Question

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now how the hell I end up arguing with this bitch? (aww)
Know everything, but don't know shit (aww)
Kinda reminiscent of Anna Nicole Smith (aww)
I just turn my music up like 'Damn that's some cold shit' (aww)
I mighta known her 'bout a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from being a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady Eloise I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke?
He said 'You lying yo, why is you lying yo?'
Cut it out, quit it G, you hurting my kid-i-neys
Naw, she talking bout a couple of kids for me (aww)
She's hinting at a ring from Tiffany's
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day I've been treating fat hoes differently

[Hook: Kanye West]
Aww, I see now
You was hurt and you on the rebound (aww)
Ben & Jerry's and Mickey D's now
And you just gone gain all that weight on me now (naw)
Naw (naw), fall back
If I ain't a player then what the hell you call that?
A nigga disrespect me I'mma be in all black
But baby if you let me I'mma take it all back

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh & Consequence]
I write verses, do shows for a living
Hoes, they look at me like every day Thanksgiving
Peep, check how I'm living, white T's, free jeans
Shotgun and Capri's, big height like Yao Ming
And it seems the style then how they go out they way
Just to prove they dedicated and devoted to Ray
I guess it goes how they say, that that pimp will repay
That's why I put 'em to the test like every day
Not like the G.E.D. or an S.A.T
Pop quiz, let 'em know that they meal ain't free
It's on like a college degree when you following me
Without the entry level job there's a modelling fee
So when I tell you 'Get 'em girl' and you prove that you true
I let you bolt up on the block with the rest of the crew
This just a couple of trials that we put 'em through
Let a nigga know now what you tryna do, for real

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Phonte the five star syllablist, females
I hit 'em with deliberate styles for me to try to lay with them
And then chill around the way with them
Like her name was Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee and them
Spat game, when it come to my ex dames?
I keep 'em in-line like rollerblades at the X-Games
Phonte never was the type to kirk out and stress thangs
Till the album dropped now you thinking my rep changed
Look, we ain't sleeping on the floor no more
But it's a strange misconception I ain't poor no more
That's bullshit, if they ain't paying, fuck a Promo tour
I'd rather keep my ass home and hit the porno store
So we hit the sex shop cause she wanted to get with me
Two shots of 'gnac she started acting so giggly
Nine months later she went into delivery
And since then I treat my baby mama so differently, word

[Hook]

[Outro: Kanye West]
All back, yo I swear I'mma take this truck back man
I mean I got the new G5, whatever
That shit be in shop every two weeks
I told 'em, I told 'em if y'all don't take this back
And give me all my money back and trade me in for the CL
I'm gonna put it on this Little Brother song in two weeks and
And they ain't believe me but
Now I'mma let y'all know don't go out and buy the G5
I swear like it's a bad look for the girls
Really they get in the car
And they always wanna look over and be like
'Aw nigga, your check engine light on, it's on'
I'm like 'Your top on
So we got two things we tryna get off right here'
They don't like that
I take it back, I take it back, I just say it to get you mad
I take it back, I could prove, I could prove something to you
Yo, yo I been in North Carolina for two days
Where's the hoes at my nig'?
