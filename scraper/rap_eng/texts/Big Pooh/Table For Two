[Intro] [Phonte talking]
I want you to look on your um, look on your list right there
Should be ah, reservation for Mr. & Mrs. Tiggalo. Alright? Okay?
I want you to give me your best table. Okay, the best table
Know what I'm sayin'? By the window over the view and shit
Alright? And also I need to know
Can I pay at this restaurant with multiple credit cards
Is it-I-I can do that? That's-that's cool? Oh, okay

[Big Pooh talking]
Uh! Yeah (A world premier). This that good hard bottom music
Strictly for the hard bottom crowd. (A world premier)
Strictly for the...Fedora crowd. Get your scarfs out
Get your handkerchiefs ready. Yeah

[Verse One] [Big Pooh]
I'm pushin' work to the side baby
I know I drive you crazy
I'm surprised you don't even hate me
You say I'm cheatin' on you
It's more like I've been sleepin' on you
Long days turn to short nights
And short nights mean another fight
We always arguin'
In my heart though, I know you right
So put some clothes on
Cause we gonna do all them things that you wanna
Walkin' on the beach, I don't care, it ain't summer
Picnic in the park we can clown a couple runners
Show my baby off, you the number one stunna
Dinner at the finest, restaurant
Dancin'
Anything you ask for is done, I'm romancin'
Nigga know he chancin'
Everything I have to get everything I couldn't
Even though I shouldn't
Put you on the back burner
I'm a fast learner
Check please, we got places to go
Gone (Let's go)

[Hook] [Yazarah]
They got you workin' late at night babe
So here's a little somethin' for you (for you)
For you (for you)
For you (I know, yeah yeah, I know, I know)
I put your favorite dress on baby let's get away
And let's get a table for two (for two)
For two (for two)
For two (one, two and ya don't stop)

[Verse Two] [Jozeemo]
And after while bright lights start burnin'
But I don't need a tan
So for now we gon' wing it
Cause we don't need a plan
We gon' grab a couple dollars and book it to where it's cozy
Seclusion is the key cause hella hip hoppers know me
Jozee, no
It's Mr. Murdock this evenin'
No, I'm not ashamed of my lyrical achievements
I, just want to hang with my lady for a couple hours
Couple Armaretto sours
Candle light, couple flowers
And let her know, although I do keep up a lot of drama
It's only cause I want my bank account to show a lot of commas
I got a lot of promises that I ain't made good on
To busy waitin' for my city just to say, "I put on"
Don't get me wrong
I love being a winner
But right now I just wanna eat my dinner
So as soon as we enter, "Garsoon, your finest table for a duo."
We only want the main course, the desert is gonna be, you know

[Hook] [Yazarah]
They got you workin' late at night babe
So here's a little somethin' for you (for you)
For you (for you)
For you (I know, yeah yeah, I know, I know)
I put your favorite dress on baby let's get away
And let's get a table for two (for two)
For two (for two)
For two (one, two and ya don't stop)

[Verse Two] [Phonte]
Yo, live nigga advocate
Renaissance B-Boy
2 by 4 flow, but I could never be bored/board
I'm takin' out you posers and you decoys
She like, "Tay, step away from the keyboard."
I'm like, "Baby give me space like Leonard Nimoy
My time is our time. Don't be so p-noid."
A D-Boy of understand
I know it's demanding
Especially when half the time I'm out gallivantin'
Be singin' all around the world like a Troubadour
To make the people move like they never move before
I rap and make a nigga clap on the 2 and 4
But tonight, I wanna do a little somethin' just for you and yours
So put your dress on and hop up out your rockin' chair
Make a reservation, get a car, call the concierge
Don Draper swag, black suit, white pocket square
Might have seen a few, but to you they do not compare
Let's ride

[Hook] [Yazarah]
They got you workin' late at night babe
So here's a little somethin' for you (for you)
For you (for you)
For you (I know, yeah yeah, I know, I know)
I put your favorite dress on baby let's get away
And let's get a table for two (for two)
For two (for two)
For two (one, two and ya don't stop)

[Outro] [Phonte talking]
Okay now, you can put...$50 on this card right here
And you put $50 on that one, okay. And then I think you can put on...
Okay, on this one right here...I think you can put...
You can put another $50 on this one
Okay, okay then in case we got to bounce, okay, aight

You can put on this card
You...shit, this one's expired. Ah, man, ah, y'all take a check?
