[Phonte]
Yo, six minutes to showtime, I was out in the rain
With my nigga Big Pooh goin over some thangs
No money in our pockets, just a buck and some change
Ran up in the hideaway wit niggas screamin our name
Took the stage like a jet soarin, wildin out wit the sweat pourin
'til I woke up hoarse the next mornin
An ill feelin that it brings about
To see niggas mouthin yo' words and you ain't even got a single out
On stage sealin yo' spot, is the equivalent of ten adrenaline shots
Just like L.E.G.A.C.Y. and Sean Boog when they killin the R.O.C
Ain't gotta worry 'bout if niggas just pretendin it's hot
Cause I can see they hands in the air wavin, heads bobbin
Neck snappin back and forth, 'bout to break that shit
Man I appreciate that shit, thanks for showin' us love
And to the top we fin' to take that shit - fo' y'all

[Hook 2X] - add Q-Tip's "INHALE" sample at the end of the third line

(Whatcha doin, babe..)

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I see y'all cats wit yo hands high
Up front shoutin out the songs real loud, real proud
Lettin every other person know
Who you came to see and who you came to rock fo' - Little Brother
That's why we stay vibin, pens stay scribbin
Wrist rotatin to keep your soul pulsatin
It's been a long time, but most folks still waitin
All apologies, but thank you for stayin patient
And die hard, that's why we try hard
Dig deep demand, so we supply y'all
Pusherman, and we wanna keep you high far
From content wit this current state of hip-hop
We know music, we know why some don't choose it
Y'all know the truth, I hope y'all don't lose it
Bullshit, everyday we all go through it
We givin y'all some shit that's therapeutic - so breathe easy y'all

[Hook 6X w/ ad-libs and variations]
