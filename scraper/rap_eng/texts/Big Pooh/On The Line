[Verse One: Joe Scudda]
"Each day I"
Dream, of making it big
Staking my bid
But still cats is snaking the kid, so
"Each day I"
Move on the humble
Keep my ears streets, you could lose in this jungle
That's why
"Each day I"
See what I see
Do what I do
And never in my life screw who I knew
So
"Each" day I
Say I
Will do anything for fam
Carry my team on my back like A.I
"Each day I"
Breeze through the street in a hooptie with a loosie and trees on my feet
Thinking
"Each day I"
Could wake up and kiss my girl
Go outside, look up and kiss the world
Yelling
"Each day I"
Shall make it better than the other
Make more cheddar for my brothers
Go and kiss my mother
"Each" day I
Say I
Reminisce to being a kid wanting to play, asking "Mother may I"
"Each day I"

[Sean Boog]
I'm back on the grind
Trying to find a better way to master the rhyme
Mastermind a plan, expand
Hats in the sky
Trying to stay thankful instead of asking God "Why?"
But
To many cats on the side trying to scheme on
Me and my team, y'all fags better dream on
The things I lean on, family and my own two
Feet, do with me so you I won't do
The shit I go through is not alone
I, rise, hustle, never rest in the clone
The way that I roam is like a cellular phone
From the pad to the drop to the lab and back home
To my girl's dorm
Then outta town for a show
Each day I don't know how it'll go
It's an amazing maze of face to face shit
I'm gonna make it cause my victory is tasted

[Hook] {x2}
Hustle, drink, smoke, rhyme
All day, everyday, living on the grind
Hustle, drink, smoke, rhyme
Going all out cause our lives on the line

[Verse Three: Rapper Big Pooh]
I ain't travel 3,000 miles for The Love Movement
I traveled 3,000 miles trying to move units
Pitch to fiends this lyrical crack
Push everything I have then push right back
To the state of NC where the market's slow
I can cook product cheap, serve the world, get doe
I ain't talking 'bout hash, E, coke or O's
Talking 'bout Chaundon, Boogs, and Joe
Master flow, you dealing with a bastard yo
Got a tip for your career, put it in plastic so
Many wonder what happened to that nice guy
Success comes at a price ma
Roll the dice I'm
Still on the grind making joints that bang
I gotta tell these MC's that I rap for change
Preferable big bills cause I need some thangs
Like a house and a whip and a family mayne

[Chaundon]
Uh huh
Each day I'm
Waking up six in the morning
Breaking my neck, slaving for a check
Five bucks over minimum wage, like that mean something
Borderline poverty and I ain't seeing nothing
Each day I'm plotting a scheme
For unstoppable cream
It's the American dream
Nahmean?
Even if I gotta hit the block
Put a bitch on the strip cause my hunger don't stop
Now, each day I'm
Writing a rhyme, reserving the crime
Accepting calls from my son serving his time
Each day I'm
Burning up trees until I look Japanese to escape reality
That's because each day I'm
Feeling like a lost soul
Life is a joke and I'm waiting for the drum roll
Each day I'm praying for this thing to change
Cause it feels like I'm living in vain
Now what I'm saying?
