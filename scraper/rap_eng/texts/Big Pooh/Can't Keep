[Big Pooh]:
Listen, the same things make you laugh makes you cry
So I'm guessing that's the reason that I gotta say "goodbye"
I really miss you and I wanted this to be
But I gotta let you go girl, it's not you it's me
I have a problem committing
I be on the low bullshittin'
Late night trickin'
Dippin'
Tryin' to find anyway out
There's somebody out there that know what I'm talkin' 'bout

[Phonte]:
Cause even though I played hard when you met me
I can't front, when we argue it's sexy
Cause that let's me
Know that you care and
And there ain't too many things you wouldn't do to protect me
Started out as friends, now we share the same space
Yet even still it feel like we ain't in the same place
I'm in the bar with Big Pooh and Gisli
Tryin' to figure out why love always defeats me
