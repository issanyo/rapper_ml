[Verse 1: Eric "Blakk Soul" Keith]
Will they still love ya?
When you fall from the summer
Piling up to build your name
Will they see you on the
Bus to the come up? Pass you walking in the rain
Seize the moment
Opportunity awaits you, never let it pass you by
Consequences come plenty chances, not many
But baby you were born to shine
Take a look at my life
You will see there is more than what happens online
It's a sign of the times
When that is enough to feel you know my strife
Stay prayed up the most high
Has my destiny written, my stars will align
And no hate can withhold me my faith is divine
You will see

[Hook: Eric "Blakk Soul" Keith]
Fools lay low in the winter
Just ride in the summer
Sun so warm but the streets so cold
Ain't no love in my city
If you knew what I've been through
If you'd seen what my eyes have seen
You would understand just how I move

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Flying high 30,000 feet
Feeling a little awkward in my seat
Hope the lady next to me don't speak I need sleep
Distant memories begin to creep in
Remember that weekend?
Your body felt a little weakened
Then your inner voice started speaking
Four long days in a haze you amazed you barely made it
There's a thin line between life and death that you skating
Like getting rushed to the emergency
Somewhere in the north east and you need attention urgently
The jaws of life prying me from the wreckage
Popping percocets on stage, we wanting seconds
Or maybe there's a lack in communication
That then leads to the frustration
We want it now, niggas ain't patient
Long couch, feeling like a patient who won't say shit
Ship sinking, heavy drinking
Fuck rap when your life's spiraling out of control
But all they wanna know is "When that new shit coming?"
Standing on stage by myself, heart drumming
Pour your soul out, they ain't coming
Step outside box they go running
I'm giving up a piece of me
Open up for a piece to see
It's all peace when you finally free

[Hook]
