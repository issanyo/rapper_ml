Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, check it, uh

[Hook: Phonte (Rapper Big Pooh)]
Dirt nasty stinking
Get it up, get a cup, get a drink and
Rolling up in them big red Lincoln trucks
They ask, "What the fuck was y'all thinking?"
(Uh, Carolina agents)
(Get a flick, get a chick, hit a Days Inn)
(Come through with the crew, and we making)
(Noise, they ask, "Why them boys is so flagrant?")

[Verse 1: Phonte]
Might want to call your bet off, fix is in
And y'all can't contend with this joint we 'bout to set off
Every time Phonte come in your town
And start throwing it down, a couple rounds get let off
In commemoration of, his penetration
Through your defense and it's a celebration when
Everybody cheering for me in the skybox
'Cause my team break fast like IHOP
And if you get scared, you will get served
Televised Nationwide, like insurance
And you too can feel a aftershock
Ten years later, still be a laughing stock
'Cause we always make the play, in the house
And we calling niggas out like graduation day
9th Wonder's the editor, and Pooh's the predator
But 'Te's the creditor, I'mma make them pay, you know? Come on

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
I'm wild with it, shiznit's wicked
A mano peque√±o, did it with no gimmicks
My, pro image, throwback vintage
Shines every time, you can read it in my sentence
Pray repentance, niggas is coming, young'un
Gunning, like Larry and them
Who's hurrying him? See Poobie step back
Observe one time, start worrying them (Ha!)
My God, my squad, go hard
Remind young goon of junkyard
We truck y'all like Shaq with Kob'
Keep niggas running, damn it's only thirty sold?!
You could fold if you want to, this lukewarm summer
Means, bar hugging for the rest of the year
Got bitches back naked like it's hot in here
If you scared, say you scared, I can smell the fear NIGGA!

[Bridge: Phonte, (Rapper Big Pooh)]
Uh...one more time, let's give it to them
Check it out, check it out, uh...

[Verse 3: Phonte, (Rapper Big Pooh)]
Yo, I will not lose, and if you thought
I would ever settle for anything less, homey, I got news
(I write crews like Teddy and Erv')
(Motherfuckers better learn)
('fore that bridge get burned)
To the third degree, NC's the new state of emergency
Yes, yes, we get it popping
Kicking the truth and just sticking to the doctrine
I'm here to tell you, failure is not an option

[Verse 4: Rapper Big Pooh (Phonte)]
I heard the streets are watching, people plotting
LB's in the house and we keep it popping
(Let 'em know)
The beats are dropping, verses ready
Big Dho's in the house! So the checks are heavy

[Verse 5: Phonte]
And C. Simms is holding the camera extra steady
'Cause when I'm on stage, it's hard to stand still
The haters be like, "Give it a rest already"
Nigga, I don't give a fuck how you and your man feel, you know?! (shit!) come on
