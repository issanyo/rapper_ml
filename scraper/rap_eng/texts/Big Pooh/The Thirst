[Hook x6: Chaundon]
I'm just sayin', I'm sayin' these hoes is thirsty

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
I met her on the humble, navigating the jungle
Of this business that I claim, a cheetah with no name
Big game hunter makin' niggas pray for the summer
I mean shawty fine, but her mind picked a number
On the crazy chart, never feed the animals, enjoy the park
Every once in a while one is crazy smart
Robert Greene say seduction is an art
I'm guessing she read the part about the charmer
My confidence is armor, I don't need it though
Still wanna beat it, though
Had to realize I was dealing with a professional
? confessional, ignoring all advances
She throwing me the pussy, I Braylon Edwards the chances
We don't talk for a minute
Then a text comes, say "I still want you in it"
When you next come I can tell she really meant it
Not in a relationship but still tryna end it
She thirsty

[Hook x6: Chaundon]

[Verse 2: Chaundon]
Notice you peepin', then we started speakin'
Sexual tension, what's a nigga to do?
So we started creepin', then I stopped fiendin'
The very next weekend you was lovin' the crew
But hatin' on me 'cause I was huggin' my boo
She back for a guilt trip, "Did I mean nothing to you?"
"Of course", my response was true - a bit rash
C'mon, your fine ass was just something to do
Besides, I peep game by the look in your eyes
The sort of thirst that'll never be quenched by any guy
Reverse cowgirl can't take me for a ride
Though I slid bareback for a couple of times
Pulled up, I ain't fallin' for the trap
Two ain't becoming three, so I ain't comin' to thee
And you and me will never be we, quit reachin'
You stay with a cup in your hand, it's thirst season
