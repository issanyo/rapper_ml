[Nightclub Emcee]
Good evening ladies and gentleman, this is Eddie Hendricks the legend
I want to thank y'all for coming out this evening
And I'm sorry 'bout that $2 coverage charge, but we have to pay the entertainment
As I present to you Phonte, Big Pooh, 9th Wonder
So y'all just put yo hands together as we bring to the stage, Little Brother
Little Brother, y'all go 'head and do a little something for 'em

[Verse 1]
[Phonte]
Hey, I flew in from NC to keep us moving on schedule
Nat Cole shit, I'm King Unforgettable
Writing on the plane, these words is barely legible
But once again back is the incredible

[Big Pooh]
The Little Brother, we number one
Always getting the job done, we some smooth operators
Haters come close, but they can't touch
Run back and they can't rush, imagine dat shit
Jay Dee's dreams is plastic
I'm tired of stretching money out like elastic
Drastic measures we gon' have to take
Like serving classes up fresh out the gate

[Phonte]
Without the papes we 'bout to get this rap shit nailed down
Cause stakes is high, so I eat at Taco Bell now
Yo, get it up cause it's alright for y'all to yell now
Wearing yo' Avirex, the cowry shell down

[Hook]
It's so beautiful, so fabulous
So exclusive, so extravagant
We money making (show stopping emcees)
Neva faking, keep on

[Verse 2]
[Phonte]
If you think you can out-rhyme me, boy I bet
I ain't met the motherfucka who can do that yet
Why their played out rhymes remain odd
I stay cool like James Todd, and still remain dominant
Up in yo spot tonight, we steady rocking it
And I'm gonna knock you out, just like mama said
To Lenny, blunt smokes, cigarettes, Henny
But it's something 'bout these hoes, Lord forgive me

[Big Pooh (and Phonte)]
I stepped in about a quarter pass, you know, whatever
I'm trying to get up on some ass, like whatever
And grab a quick bite by the end of the night
I drain trying to complain, and knees killing me, right
But you know we got that hot shit
Known to rock the block, and cause turbulence when you in the cock pit
(Cool, cause he don't get upset)
I grab a bucket of wings, get some snacks, and I jet

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
{Big Pooh imitating "Audio Two"}
MC P-O, people call me Pooh
When I'm busting up the party, I'ma rock fa you
9th is cutting up for the
Niggas in the Justus League
{Phonte imitating "Kool G Rap"}
And to you rappers taking all figures
For industry niggas, the ball players
Dropping 'em off of all makers
Wit yo' whole team in ambulances
We building more beef than cattle ranches
Against the snowstorms and avalanches
{Big Pooh imitating "Slick Rick"}
Well, it was one of those days (not much to do)
I was steady writing rhymes (for the Little Brother crew)
Of the two be Phonte, and 9th, plus Eccentric
And Big Doe in case I didn't mention
(But did you tell 'em 'bout the League) Oh yes, the League of Justus
(And did you remember what they need) These kids, they want substance
Rhymes and beats keep my day flowing lovely
But I'ma say "crumbs" and pass it off to Doug E
{Phonte imitating "Doug E. Fresh"}
This is all about no doubt for Little Brother
But first, let's take a moment to recover
[(Beatbox)] Shwang
This has been written, it's never bitten
You keep forgetting the lyrics on tracks that I'm spitting
The only thing worse are the emcees that I'm ripping
They talking shit and wishing
Some of these guys getting' all hurked up
From a ghost-written rhyme by a chump, word up
It don't make you a big man, and
To wanna diss Little Brother man, and
We all know, it's part of the plan (Why?)
Cuz Phonte and Pooh is in full demand

[Hook 2x]

One time for your mind, one time for your mind
One time for your mind, one time for your mind
One time for your mind, two times for my nigga Big Pooh
Three times for my Greensboro dimes, seven times whatever
I don't trip, Doe don't trip, 9th don't trip, Leg don't trip
Mike don't trip, Te don't trip, Justus League forever now...
