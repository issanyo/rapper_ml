[Torae]
Uh huh, uh huh
Once again it's on
Rapper Pooh in here
Torae in here
Dae One in here

Yo, back in the booth, back on the track, back in effect
Back on my bull, I'll smack you in the back of your neck
Or better yet, right across your face, sock it all your hate
When I'm respected by the all-time greats
Now I don't mean one or two of 'em, nah that's a slew of 'em
I done been on the road and blowed in a stew with 'em
I done bodied through shows and hosed with a few of 'em
Muh'fuckin guys you idolize, I'm through with 'em
Not cause I'm a cool ass cat, I mean as true as that
You couple it with what I do on tracks
Times that by the places I done flew on maps
You niggas never been out of the trap
Nigga, my Pro Tool prominence done daily is dominant
Verses emerge, vomit they sick, nigga I got it, I'm it
You OD in this cause I'm that hit
And if you scared to stand where I'm at cause I'm that shit
Niggas got the game locked, yeah but I'm that pick
And niggas pick locks if y'all ain't get it
So anybody claiming they next, get your Scantrons
I'm putting all y'all to the test, all y'all is a mess
Nah it ain't dead but damn sure in the West
The more it do for you, the more you giving it less
So Tor' can't fall through a test, long as I'm breathing the breath
Better believe that I'mma bring you the best, nigga

When Big Pooh and Torae on a joint, it's a "go"
Schooling muh'fuckers in case you ain't "know"
And if you see us on the bill, you in for a hot "show"
We taking this where all y'all don't, so let 'em "know"
When Big Pooh and Torae on a joint, it's a "go"
Schooling muh'fuckers in case you ain't "know"
And if you see us on the bill, you in for a hot "show"
We taking this where all y'all don't, "here we go"

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Back in the building, back in the booth
Back to knocking tracks out, back to speaking the truth
So uncouth, niggas back to knotting they noose
You see I'm back on bitch longer like I'm hitting the juice
This ain't soft-ball rap, this is more Maple Bat
This is more on a track, this is keep looking back
To see I went over, yeah, head and shoulders
Rock any crowd, whether Lisbon or Boulder
Eye of the beholder or eye of the tiger
I inspire a whole new breed of writers
New freedom fighters, new nigga struggle
Ain't nothing you can say if the people don't love you
I'm still tryna bubble, some dying from trouble
Watch what you say 'fore you end up in a snuffle
Real niggas tussle, real niggas rumble
On dirt country roads or them concrete jungles
This rap's in a bundle and bundle's the new in
Watch 'em jock Rapper Pooh 'fore my verse even end
See 'em do it like I do it 'fore I can press send
Then let the world know I done did it again
This is Hip Hop's finest, this is Your Highness
Blinking the wack shit, I am Hip Hop's blindness
Coney Isle to L.A.'s where you'll find us
If you need to hear it again, just rewind this
