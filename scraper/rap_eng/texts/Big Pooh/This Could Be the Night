[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
The East Wing Club is proud to present tonight, a most delectable treat
We have Mr. Eric Roberson
We have the illustrious Darien Brockington
Also, we got the Rapper Big Pooh
All back by the Lorenzo Ferguson and The Funky Finger Experience

[Verse 1: Eric Roberson]
Our encounter started innocently
She spilled her drink on me
But she was fine
And I was fine with her hands on me
Wiping off this wine
I said let’s get in line so I can buy you another
Don’t mean no disrespect you might've came here with another
And then she replied, “Well, not tonight”
I said, “Oh, is that right?”
Well hello then, let me get that car door open for you

[Chorus]
You don't have to thank me for it
Cause nobody's keeping score
We could do anything you like
Hey baby, this could be the night
This could be the night, this could be the night
This could be the night - just for you

[Verse 2: Darien Brockington]
I got a message from you baby
That you ain’t wanna keep me waiting
“But why rush a good thing?”
To her is what I replied
Can’t get enough of you
Wanna spent my whole life with you
But for now let’s enjoy tonight
(Ay!) Let’s fast forward to the dance floor
You know what we came for
Baby, that’s to have a good time
(Girl) The mood is right, do whatever you like
Let’s party until the sunrise
[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Rapper Big Pooh]
Another splash of my favorite cologne
My baby told me six more minutes they pass, we gone
On the dance floor steppin’, leave troubles at home
On the dance floor sweatin’, baby girl in a zone
Got her head cocked back
I got my hands straight like a crease, in the air
Looking like an Ernie Barnes piece, not a care
A let yourself go moment that we both share
Let down your hair, let’s go

[Bridge: Darien Brockington]
Wanna dance the night away with you
Take my hand, let's get it started baby!

[Chorus]
