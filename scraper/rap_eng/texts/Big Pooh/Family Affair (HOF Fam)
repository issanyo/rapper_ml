[Verse One] [Big Pooh]
Since '07 I said, "Fuck being famous"
I'm still gon' make sure you know what my name is
Still gon' make sure you see where my lane is
Seven years later and I still know what pain is
Obama president, we waitin' on them changes
We broke up cause niggas ain't the same kids
Left Atlantic cause we ain't in the same biz
Neo fights lookin' like he what insane is
Shit, you don't even know the half
Motherfuckas actin' like I didn't take math
Puttin' up walls, tryin' to block my path
No matter what they do, can't stop my laugh
A best friend chose to go and cross my path
Cool ass nigga, no need for the wrath
I'm a good guy and I refuse to finish last
Most people puttin' out music now trash
Any instrumental that you got I'll smash
Claim to be a Titan when you don't wanna Clash
Ask S1 about Pooh, I mash
Got a girl head in my lap, that's class
All that bullshit that you spread, I'll pass
People go nuts when they ego get gassed
On that bitch shit, move your neck with sass
On that Cher shit, walk around with a Mask
Joe I need some more Jack D in my flask
MC Eiht niggas, +All 4 The Cash+

[Hook] [Big Pooh]
Oh no it can't be
Hall Of Justus is the family
We had it with you niggas comin' 'round talkin' free
Reservoir Dogs, pretty soon you'll see

[Verse Two] [Chaundon]
Chaundon's outta here, my career's goin' into orbit
Flow's Rasputia, y'all niggas in Norbit
Came into the game, made 'em forfeit
Hit 'em with more shit
Lyrically I carry the torches
Any broad I'm fuckin' is gorgeous
I make 'em all deep throat with no hands, I call it the cordless
Tryin' to get my hands on some Grants/grands like Horace
Flows on fire, I will burn down your forest
Every verse kick like Chuck Norris
Hooked on every one of my words, my shit will never need a chorus
Pontiac niggas goin' at a team of Porsches
Fast and furious, my track record flawless
Give it up before I get it on, cut your losses
Middle management niggas, you know who the boss is
Y'all niggas ain't nothin' but monkeys on porches
Al Green ya chest, what I spit, scorches
I keep on raisin' the bar and you're a novice
All of y'all are Roc Emerson, that mean you garbage
Run up in the street with the heat, make 'em nauseous
You girl want sex for breakfast, I feed her sausage
Bon appetit then I skeet on the porridge

[Hook] [Big Pooh]
Oh no it can't be
Hall Of Justus is the family
We had it with you niggas comin' 'round talkin' free
Reservoir Dogs, pretty soon you'll see

[Verse Three] [Joe Scudda]
As I proceed to keep flossin'
Share my speed and use caution
Give 'em what they want cause really what they need
If for me to be nothin' less than awesome
H.O.J.'s the enterprise
So anything other than us is uncivilized
Uncontrollable
And in my lane, is such a disdain for anything not a quotable
So anythang you hear from Joe is notable
It's the best shit you heard in a lifetime
My flow's the price of oil
Takin' a toll, so you can say H.O.J.'s the pipeline
You can say it, Joe Scudda's a mack
In fact you can say anything other than wack
Cause I ain't ever been that
No I will never see it
And anybody sayin' they saw it, we don't believe it
I don't have to repeat it
Put it simple and plain, I'm the best
Did it for the love of the game
Uh, I did it once than I did it again
Did it for the fans, I did it for the fame
It's the H.O.J

[Hook] [Big Pooh]
Oh no it can't be
Hall Of Justus is the family
We had it with you niggas comin' 'round talkin' free
Reservoir Dogs, pretty soon you'll see

[Verse Four] [Jozeemo]
Yeah, I got blindsided but I post right back up
I went the thug route, tool's out, bitch back up
I'm an Eastwood gang member, not a Blood, not a Crip
Tommy Gun buster, hold up that's a drum, not a clip
Niggas can't drink with me, not a drop, not a sip
But I'll get you smoked out, Rutger 9, llama fifth
Plus I got the drama kit
Magazine and hollow tips
President Barack, he should surround you with the politics
First you got the congress
Those be the old heads
House of Representatives
Niggas who won't wear red
The Senate get money
But any means necessary
They the reason the recession gon' be legendary
It's kinda scary when you think about it
Sharp shooter take your chain, blow a link up out it
Take your dream, make you blink about it
You need your mouth, you can't drink without it
Shut it before I get mad with you
Punchin' niggas so hard, break my hand grissle
I'm doin' you a favor by lettin' my man twist you
I was all cool, y'all made it a damn issue
You really wanna take it to pistols? What is you loco?
Or is you snitchin', workin' undercover for the po-po?
Put this nigga in a choke hold

[Hook] [Big Pooh]
Oh no it can't be
Hall Of Justus is the family
We had it with you niggas comin' 'round talkin' free
Reservoir Dogs, pretty soon you'll see
