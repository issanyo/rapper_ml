[Verse 1: L.E.G.A.C.Y. (Black Sheep sample)]
I been around tycoons, been around live goons
Straight up high-noon, I gaze up at high moons
Raise hell, the howling
The JL battalion, a pack of wolves
We laugh at crews, hyena
Night-dreamer, day-tripper, stage ripper
Fate giver, heavyweight hitter
Still can't believe, that Lennox knocked Mike out!
I'mma drop the mic now
(Pick it up, Pick it up, Pick it up!)
Back on the scene, gritty it seems
You can try, but know why?
'Cause you can't intervene
L-E-G the hot flash, we be the OutKast
Like Big Boi and them, flock like sick boy and them
Birds of a feather, words get more clever
While me? from North C

[Verse 2: L.E.G.A.C.Y.]
I'm a momma's boy, shit!
Not the one you want to toy with
I play games, I place blames
And point fingers, and rappers turn singers
Fucking this shit up, I used to love this shit up
Why not any more? I side-lop any score
One-sided coin, the good son
Write like Donald Goines, Kenyatta's Last Hit
I been dropping smash hit
Un-lovable, collide with hope colourful
Kaleidoscopes, switch the lenses
Spit and rinse this, like it's a dentists
I'm quick to spin this, Spin City
360 L-E-G you miss me?
See I'm witty, you don't get it!
Like virgins with no dick, shit! You'll never get it
Best in the business, ripping
And it's more dope for you
The vision, of Francis Ford Coppola
Love love and respect this
What what, man check this

[Verse 3: Rapper Big Pooh]
I'm here to silence y'all critics
Challenge y'all pri-dicks
If you don't roll with the squad, then get the di-dick
The flow's acidic, nickname should be Sulphate
'Cause I burn joints most motherfuckers can't
Spin the rumours on the net "Pooh is deadweight"
I'm laughing bastard, I just dropped six, feel it
The verse-smasher, the praise catcher
I been vibing off Anita Baker, you hear the Rapture?
Some heat and want to put me back on the block
Kansas City smack, man you got to like what I got
Made to love it, Rapper Pooh [?] in public
Twelve pounds missing nigga, now where's the budgets?
Click-Clacking, chit chatting, on the boards
What's happening? I'm the rap Daringham
Backboards, stay crashing them
Slashing them, he got a big head, who gassing him?
16 pounds and dropping bitch, stay counting them
I can't believe this nigga made me go
To the very last place you'll ever want to know
I'm so, ill with it, I'm so skill with it
Let near and I kill with it, so deal with it!
