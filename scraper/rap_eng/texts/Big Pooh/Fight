[Verse 1]
Yeah, I’ve been living through these obstacles
Everyday feeling like it’s mission impossible
At grips with myself, it’s a battle for me to make it
I ain’t singing no sad story, Renegade’s here to take it
Kick open the door, give a fuck if this bitch is vacant
Open up my mind, ain’t no time for no hesitation
The value put on life clears up all the investigations
Now you looking at me different like a nigga shouldn’t say shit
Fuck it, Imma do me, and let you punks hate it
Imma stay on my progression till it’s time for me to lay down to sleep
I pray to the [?], my soul for it to keep
My energy level is higher so my soul won’t ever sleep
Overcoming mental hardship, gearing up my starship
Soaring through the galaxy, my reality targets
Certain individuals, ‘m cutting through the margins
Now you niggas want to be a part of what I started?
I would’ve done this regardless, still on the rise like the prices in the market
Trying to break the cycle, feel like Malcom when I’m talking
Now I’m the baddest nigga living [?]

[Hook][x2]
We got to fight to the end
We got to fight to the end
They won’t admit they lost, the truth will always fucking win
Born as a leader, I don’t follow any trends

[Verse 2 – Rapper Big Pooh]
The light’s on, my mic’s warm
Take a bite of the competition, I’m Tyson
I write songs, this is my life
Not a story I tell to get them sales right
Even when them sales light I still got to live homie
You only know what I tell you, you don’t know me
A lot of niggas scream they real, yeah they really phony
I’m genuine, ask your girl, she want to ride the pony
I had deals, I blown budgets
Don’t ask about my brothers cause I won’t discuss it
Don’t trust it, that’s what PE said
Cause [?] leaves the idle mind dead
The idle mind’s scared of being perceived as a failure
Stand to fall for anything them busters bout to tell you
I’m real familiar with starting, starting from the bottom
You was looking for a fight, well you got em
It’s Rapper!
