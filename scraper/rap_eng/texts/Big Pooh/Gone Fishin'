[Hook]
Listen girl I wanna take you home
Listen girl I wanna take you home
What's your phone number?
I wanna take you home
Matter of fact, I wanna bring you home
What's your phone number?
I wanna bring you home
Listen girl I wanna bring you home
I need your phone number
Can I bring you home?
I wanna bring you home
What's your phone number?

[Verse 1]
It's written all over your face
You don't have to say a word
But of course you can
I know we just e-met, I'm tryna be your man
I'm sayin', cause girl I dig your look
And against better judgment, fuck the rest of the book
What a cover, I wanna be your lover, babe
You said you like Prince, right?
Long walks under moonlight
You want a man to fuck you all night, right?
Strawberries, wine, and whipped cream
Blackberry come and be a part of my team
Matter fact, check it out, what's your phone number?
What's your Skype name? You ain't got a camera?
It's all good, let me hear what you talkin' 'bout
Girl sick, sight, voice, I'mma rub one out
So I checked on a plane ticket
The way my account set up, well, you don't wanna hear it
Yo, it's either train or bus
Somebody gotta travel, if it's gonna be an us
Oh, you're busy next month?
Oh, the next three months?

[Hook]
I'm tryin' to get you home
Baby girl I'm tryin' to get you home
Tryin' to get you, yeah
I'm tryin' to get you home
And I'm tired of talking over the phone
I'm tryin' to get you home
I'm tryin' to get you home
Nigga tired of talking over the phone
I need to get you home

[Bridge]
If you think you're lonely now
Then wait until tonight girl

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of playing this game
What the fuck you waiting on? We need to finally set a date
Only so much time I can patiently wait
If I ain't with you looking forward to right now then I ain't
Cause I ain't, gon' keep dragging this along
And I can't, play another sad song
And I won't, keep chasing you online
And I won't, so what we finna do, huh?

[Outro]
You best to get on that bus
Greyhound, Megabus
You better travel to see me
I wanna see you
I need you
I want you
Oh
You better jump on the Amtrak, baby
The airbus, cop you a ticket
Priceline
You best a-call William Shatner baby
And get your tickets for cheap
I want you
