[Intro: Phonte]
Uh, we gon get it started man
I'm feelin' so fresh tonight
Yes, yes, ya'know
I'm seein' all the beautiful people
Everybody rockin' they favorite brand
Whatever your favorite brand is, it's whatever you wanna do
You know what I'm sayin', but um, you know
I didn't always have it like that
We ain't always have it, you know what I'm sayin', so
This what we had to do, to look fly you know what I'm sayin
This is how you used to get it in

[Phonte]
Aiyyo, I used to go to the mall with forty dollars in hand
It ain't matter at all cause I could go see my man
Down at Southsquare Mall workin' at J. Riggins, oh no
Manager leaves, he let me cop from the lo-lo
Slacks and polos, you better watch that
Boy in Durango's, blazer, and mock neck
Almost broke but you still gon' see him
At the T game pimpin through the Greensboro Coliseum, man

[Refrain: Phonte]
Uh, cause now I got on my good clothes
I'm sick of wearin hand-me-down, raggedy hood clothes
Call me ugly, man I wish a bitch would clothes
Go out to the club, yea we probably should clothes
Yea, uh, say I got on my good clothes, what
Uh, say I got on my good clothes
Yo, forty dollars I done got me some good clothes
I got on my good clothes
I got on my good clothes

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I used to go to my mom, like I'm tryna be fresh
Told her, look at my closet, you know, your boy look a mess
So we hopped in the car, headed straight to Sears
At the time I was bigger than the rest of my peers
As we got on the floor, was embarrassing, trust me
The saleswoman walk me straight over to Husky
I still got stonewashed denim, Bobby Brown patent leather
Members Only jacket, ain't nobody fresher than me

[Refrain: Big Pooh]
I said I got on my good clothes
Sick of wearin hand-me-down, raggedy hood clothes
Call me ugly, man I wish a bitch would clothes
Go out to the club, yea we probably should clothes
Yea! I said I got on my good clothes
What? You know I got on my good clothes
Husky jeans, patent leather, I want those
I got on my good clothes
I got on my good clothes

[Phonte - overlaps Hook, then interlude]
Yo lemme talk to 'em Pooh
Check it out, yeah
Y'all lookin good tonight
But some of y'all that's in the wrong, I cain't front
Like you at the bar, it's hot in this club man
So why you got that leather coat on, dawg
C'mon, take that coat off, nigga
And you, the big girl with the low-rise jeans on
Got the fat hangin' over the side, better go to Lane Bryant
Girl, you got your gut bustin' over the side of your jeans
It look like a muffin
C'mon now
Let's be polite

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I got boxes of shoes, get shirts by the caseload
Size 48 jeans, how did they make those
New Eras we take those, givin us good clothes
Nothing when you broke, when you ain't you don't spend dough

[Phonte]
I had a homie at Azzure, but he got tired
And another at Stall & Dean, but he got fired
So ironic when you want it, you the last on the list
But when you get cake, they cain't wait to give you some shit
Nah I'm sayin'

[Refrain: Phonte]
Uh, cause now I got on my good clothes
I'm sick of wearin hand-me-down, raggedy hood clothes
Call me ugly, man I wish a bitch would clothes
Go out to the club, yea I probably should clothes
Yea, uh, say I got on my good clothes, what
Uh, say I got on my good clothes
Yo, forty free now I got all these good clothes
I got on my good clothes
I got on my good clothes, yeah

[Outro]
Shout out, to all my good clothes suppliers
Talkin about my man, male party man, Lindsay
Talkin about my homegirl, Porsha
Talkin about my man, Neil Nice, Kev Dean
Talkin about my man Born, uh
Yea...We got on these good clothes
We got on these good clothes, for-hee
