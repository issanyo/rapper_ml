[Intro]
Uh, yeah
Rapper

[Rapper Big Pooh]
So many albums in the six-year span
Gettin pats on the back like, "Nigga, you the man"
I am, in a trance, this is movin too fast
Fallin out of touch, you would think of the past
Full blast, here we go, on tour, 'nother show
People don't know the difference, only had a video
He's Tay, I'm Pooh, no 9th, get it right
When the sun comes up, that's the ending of my night
Take flight, overseas, tryna stack a few Es'
Had a couple pounds, come home, make 'em Gs'
I see shit change in the matter of some years
We the older brothers gettin lacked by our peers
No tears, you surprised? Huh, clap for 'em
Shout to Little Brother, we gave 'em the platform
I'm a storm when it's calm, the great agitator
Peace to Jaycee, take me out with the fader

[Chorus]
You can say what you wanna say about my crew
Most new niggas out been influenced by who?
(JUSTUS!) We the blueprint, watch how we do shit
Peace to Jaycee, take me out with the fader
You can say what you wanna say about my crew
Most new niggas out been influenced by who?
(JUSTUS!) We the blueprint, watch how we do shit
We inspire all of y'all through our music

[Rapper Big Pooh]
So many shows in the six-year span
Gettin pats on the back like, "Nigga, you the man"
I am, in a trance, this is movin too fast
Pound on my knees, pray to God that it last
I been down to my last more times than I could count
Should I sell my soul for a sizable amount?
That's a no-go, slow-mo, now I'm out the front do'
Hands up, on stage, 'round here like a go-go
I said "FUCK promo!," we gotta get paid
Touchdown indy city, know the club get slayed
Niggas used to think we would blow like grenades
'til life played the barber and she cut us all fades
Now when I'm out, certain niggas throw shades
Cause they listen to the (station) when I ain't bein played
Why get mad? Get even, when I feel like leaving
I plan to be full off lemonade

[Chorus]
[Outro]
I mean, real talk man..
At the end of the day
We made it possible for you niggas to be you
I mean, it's ain't e'en on no "on my dick" shit
This is real talk, nigga
I mean, we were the muh'fuckin guinea pigs, niggas
Heh, bow down and respect nigga
You can say what you wanna say, ha yeah, yo
You can say what you wanna say, ha yeah, yo
You can say what you wanna say, ha, listen
You can say what you wanna say
