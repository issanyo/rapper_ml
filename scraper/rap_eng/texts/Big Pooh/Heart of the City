[Intro]
I'd like to welcome you
To a place we all know
To a place we all been
You either love it or you hate it

[Verse 1]
I'd like to welcome y'all, to the heart of the city
Where the people cold and they show no pity
Better have a team or get stuck by committee
Yeh I got a job but the pay is real shitty
Beggers holdin' signs walk the street so silly
We all got scams for real some hold millis
Dollars to they name, some gettin' none some sons
Niggas knock just to have little fun
Some daughters bed hop just to have a little funds
We all eat good if the child support comes
First of the month cheques hit we like kings
Servin' up fiends summertime ice cream
Trucks bring joy back, to the lives of the kids momma on crack
Daddy's gone and I doubt he'll be comin' back
Hit the lotto get money don't know how to act
And it goes on

[HOOK]
Time keep slippin' and time keep passin'
And the cops keep harassin' and the streets still laughin'
No place to turn when you livin' on the ave and
Welcome to the heart of the city
Where the chief pull choke, cats go for broke
We all got secrets and the land use dope
They shut down the block for the likes of the po'
Welcome to the heart of the city

[Verse 2]
Ain't nuthin' like the night life, all the clubs pack they lines tight
And charge twenty at the door, 'bout twelve a.m. about ten dollars more
It's all worth the while once you hit the dancefloor
????????? while you lookin' at the whores
Damn she's so fine passin' by heaven's doors
Gettin' out the cars these days they roll coors
Where else traffic stop green lights just because
Speakin' wid familiar faces, drinkin' Henny straight no chasers
Alcohol lost its flavor, down Corona like it's tap water
Goin' home no light city school teachers never had order
Appreciate what the block taught ya
Everyday the same niggas holdin' down the same street corners
And they swear she lookin' good on her
If you ain't fam, then you labled as another foreigner

HOOK
