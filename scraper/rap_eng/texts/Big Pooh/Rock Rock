[Hook]
Rock rock da beat da beat beat
You got ta keep keep keep on
You got ta rock rock da beat da beat beat
You got ta keep keep keep on
You got ta rock

[Verse 1: T3]
Tall as midget napoleon complex with dynamite in his pocket proving he bomb shit
Well if i blow then i must of been a threat
Niggas say i show boat i guess they all on my deck
Meanwhile i speed boat bitches
Great dame pictures, big dog like me jump fences
My intentions is to give niggas the business
For stealing style so much that it's infringement
I run towards confrontations these days
Try to put a end to them he say she says
Rappers are clich√©, funny as d ray
I keep a game face, watch my freeze frame rock

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo I'm the master of my destiny
Trouble keep testing me stressing me
Don't they know that rapper got the recipe
The rest'll see I'm ecstasy
Every night I burn a vampire da steak
I been had a seat the table now I'm looking for my plate
Them niggas couldn't wait for my wake now my wake ain't the issue
Some don't know your worth until they miss you
These hoes wanna kiss you when they think you doing better
Cause status always make they pussy wetter
Notice only rodents chase cheddar
Taking aim like I hold a Beretta
Young cold nigga handing out sweaters
I don't care who you name they competitors

[Verse 3: Illa J]
