[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah, it's Rapper, it's 9th Wonder, hah
I'm seeing life in my rear view mirror
And I recognise that people do change
While viewing life in my rear view mirror
I recognise we all gotta go through thangs
This is life in my rear view
If you just turn around, you can see it too
This is life in my rear view
If I just turn around, I can see it through

As time go by, I ain't gon' lie
I think I seen enough to make a grown man cry
My grandmamma's gone, then my uncle's on
Gotta stay strong for the fam
I gotta keep strong for myself
Seen my little bit of wealth, money can't cure
All of the pain that the heart endures
The memory's here, here comes a new year
Here comes a new spirit, tell me can you hear it?
Got a little louder, we all begin to fear it
So we push back, then we push out
'Til we still alone and the world forgot about
The things that you did, goals you accomplished
That dream that you had, now a broken promise
I vowed to be honest, bare my soul
Hear people taking shots and they wonder why I'm cold
My story unfolds like any other
Gotta pay homage to them older brothers
Who came here before me, laid the foundation
Started as a fad, now a great situation
I ain't had a job since '03
But the music business is more than you see
We made a bit of magic when we did it as three
Then we grew up, then we grew apart
That's when I realised it was bigger than art
But grown men gon' do what grown men do
I can't put the blame all on another dude
No communication, that mean we didn't speak
That's why on +Getback+, it was two, not three
Wish nothing but the best to my homeboy P
I also went through it with my homeboy G
But this go around took a little bit of time
I already put our whole story in a rhyme
The lord says forgive, well mama I'm tryin
Ronnie I'm flyin, all grown up
Came home just in time, seen your boy blown up
I know it's that time, gotta stand on my two
Tighten my belt, lean on Rapper Pooh
Was it really love that we shared as a crew?
Cause love ain't something you say, you do
It was all fun when we were all young
And we were all dumb, just making jams
Of course shit change when you start to see grands
Everybody reaching out to you with their hands
Not having structure, two separate plans
Niggas wanna vote for themselves as the man
Now we got factions, no longer whole
Shit can't work if you all want control
Niggas never sold our souls to the Devil
At the same time we gripped our own shovels
Heavy on the bass, went light on the treble
Big bad company, we just little pebbles
Learnt a whole lot, don't regret the move
Came back to it indie, had nothing to prove
Go hard every time, got nothing to lose
At the end of the day, it's your right to choose

I'm seeing life in my rear view mirror
And I recognise that people do change
While viewing life in my rear view mirror
I recognise we all gotta go through thangs
This is life in my rear view
If you just turn around, you can see it too
This is life in my rear view
If I just turn around, I can see it through
