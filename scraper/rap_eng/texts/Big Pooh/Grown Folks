[Phonte]
Been known to pop the oculars of MC's that's eyein mine (uh)
Tay chillin in the cut like iodine, have you cryin blind (Wah)
Hip hop was half dead, we try to revitalize
My big Rube style, y'all Americans idolize (woooo)
And Simon says shut the fuck up when you try to rhyme
This rap shit is more than what I do with idle time (idle time)
When I was young had a vision
That one day I would move the crowd ill like a bad magician (ill like a bad magician)
Hooked with Pooh and 9th and got on a battle mission
And now we on point like statisticians (dodododo ...)
Let the whole world have a listen
Rollin across country in a van with the windows tinted (in a van with the windows tinted)
With no alcohol, blow, or no indo in it
Ten years (ten years) and y'all fuckers still tryin to get your demo finished? (AH!)
Damn shame y'all done been so timid
A "House Party", and "I'm gonna get those digits!"

[Hook - Phonte] (Rapper Big Pooh) - 2X
Yo, LB put it down from North Cak to Boston
(Signs of the times and my sign read 'caution')
Lost when my rhyme style changed quite often
("Boy shut your mouth when grown folks is talkin!")

[Rapper Big Pooh]
They want to know who the best is
Expose holes in your flows like a case of asbestos
I damage rhyme architectures
The ex of professors (ex of professors), spittin lectures
Yo, my love's gonna get ya (love's gonna get ya)
Flow like ketchup, perform holdin my "Shaft"
I'm a bad mother (shut your mouth), you better watch yo ass
Glass jaw, not need MC's, they not need believe
'Til they slumped over fightin to breathe (fightin to breathe)
Incitin to squeeze, you know my steez (you know my steez)
Hundred degrees, a hundred ten percent, if you askin Bradley
I will gladly (I will gladly), bust up the scene
CO, Chief Indian, know what I mean? (know what I mean?)
Probably not, in case you forgot, a wicked jump shot (a wicked jump shot)
In my lifetime (in my lifetime), never slang crack rock
Peep the back drop, all about skills I, a lottery pick and never in the last spot

[Hook]
