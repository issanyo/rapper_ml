[Chorus]
She said she falling in love
She said she never met a nigga like me
She said she like it how I freak her in the sheets
She said she falling in love
She said she’ll know a real man when she see one
She said she falling in love
Falling falling in love
She said she falling in love
Falling falling in love

[Verse 1]
I like her - when I look at her it’s enticing
But when she looking for love
I’m not the nigga she need
Because I’m not in that point in my life
I like the way that she move
The way she do what it do
And that back side oh my
Little mama the truth
Ain’t got no reason to lie
I know her apple caught
My eye
She tell me her secrets
And I ain’t dropping a dime
She smoke good reefer
Just to ease her mind
I’m an overachiever
And she’s a diva
Plus she chocolate
Reeses Pieces
[?] sweep the streets up
Switch the condo when
The house and lease up
I beat the peep up
And she’s a freak yes

[Chorus]
She said she falling in love
She said she never met a nigga like me
She said she like it how I freak her in the sheets
She said she falling in love
She said she’ll know a real man when she see one
She said she falling in love
Falling falling in love
She said she falling in love
Falling falling in love

[Verse 2]
Baby girl - I got what you need and more
Let me read your mind - explore
Let me see what you have in store
And I don’t wanna man of course
They scream my name when I’m on tour
Play these mind games with all these whores
One of these whores - might be yours
I’m just kidding
You know a nigga be tripping
Out here on a mission
Send me a text talking about how you miss me
I send one back with like
Four five kisses
Double D titties them shit’s ridiculous
I’ll admit it you’re the illest
Bitch alive - I grip her thigh
She stabbed me eyes
She said she falling in love

[Chorus]
She said she falling in love
She said she never met a nigga like me
She said she like it how I freak her in the sheets
She said she falling in love
She said she’ll know a real man when she see one
She said she falling in love
Falling falling in love
She said she falling in love
Falling falling in love

[Verse 3]
[?]
Say you looking for a real nigga
The way that ass bounce
I gotta make you mines
Put you in my crib that’s a Hilfiger
This is real life - no ghost
Cop you a jeep - [?]
I’m the type of nigga
That have your wrist froze
Girl you so cold
Fuck all of my hoes
Oh oh
She never met a nigga like me
I’m deep inside her like my name was I V
I bet she love me cause a nigga’s i-cey
I got trust issues but I fuck with you
We take trips we don’t post pictures

[Chorus]
She said she falling in love
She said she never met a nigga like me
She said she like it how I freak her in the sheets
She said she falling in love
She said she’ll know a real man when she see one
She said she falling in love
Falling falling in love
She said she falling in love
Falling falling in love
