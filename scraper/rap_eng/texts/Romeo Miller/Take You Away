We got you boy, Romeo
Ayo Colby, you ready? Let's go
Wassup, Akon? I go by the name of Colby O, yeah
We got you with this one boy
You and me, just make it busy, man
Ayo Colby, you ready?

When I get money I spend it on the bills
But my baby she's the exception to the rules
You might wanna call it obsession
But this to my heart, this is a natural progression
And I know that she and me can work things out
If things get tough
That's why she's a keeper, that's why she's a keeper

No one but you seems to get me, they try to sweat me
Saying baby, make me cum bed me, even if they sexy
It don't matter 'cause my heart won't let me
Put my other feelings aside
And I don't care what the other guys say
They're just jealous 'cause they don't have you
They don't have you, girl, they, they don't have you, girl

Baby, they wanna take you away from me
But that's not gonna happen, not to us, oh no
They wanna take you away from me
But the bond we have is stronger than they know
They wanna take you away from me, I ain't your average Joe
They wanna take you away, they, they wanna take
They wanna take, take you away

I never thought that I'd let this, get to me
Telling all my friends, she and I would neva be
Closer than what all they expected
But I still made sure that she was always respected
'Cause I know she possibly could be the one
If things get tough
That's why she's a keeper, that's why she's a keeper

No one but you seems to get me, they try to sweat me
Saying baby, make me cum bed me, even if they sexy
It don't matter 'cause my heart won't let me
Put my other feelings aside
And I don't care what the other guys say
They're just jealous 'cause they don't have you
They don't have you

Baby, they wanna take you away from me
But that's not gonna happen, not to us, oh no
They wanna take you away from me
But the bond we have is stronger than they know
They wanna take you away from me, I ain't your average Joe
They wanna take you away, they, they wanna take
They wanna take, take you away

Cause it's official, now that you'll be in my world
No girl be looking fly 'cause you're the one that's got my eye
Come and set it off, let it, let it off
I'll never stop if you stick by my side

She's such a vibrant thang, a vibrant thang
How she work that thang and twurk that thing
And I give a chance so she could hang
With a boss for days and still no name

Kelis chick, yeah, she kinda bossy
I never did time 'cause them years'll cost me
New six, ain't color of coffee
And I stay iced out like my name was Frosty

See shorty, she the different type
Take home to mother, might make ya wife
Walk like a model but the thugish type
Pops taught the game so I play it right

She with me and I'm labeled a prince
You ain't never had a girl like this, no, no
Colby O, the game's a wrap
Tell them other cats to take a nap

Baby, they wanna take you away from me
But that's not gonna happen, not to us, oh no
They wanna take you away from me
But the bond we have is stronger than they know
They wanna take you away from me, I ain't your average Joe
They wanna take you away, they, they wanna take
They wanna take, take you away
