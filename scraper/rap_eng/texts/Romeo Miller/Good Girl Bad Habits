[Verse 1]
Yeah, they wrong, you right
You don't need me every day but you need me for tonight
And, uh, you barely drank but you getting drunk tonight
And, uh, pardon my French but that ass sitting right
In that Stella McCartney, you tryna go to Italy
You a smart girl, study me and get her own degree
You want a good time with a bad boy
You said tonight you tryna end up on them tabloids
You all about your business huh?
You don't have no sugar daddy, independent huh?
I swear she so innocent, then she whispered in my ear "I got that ill na na"

[Hook]
I love a good girl with bad habits
I love a good girl with bad habits
Good girl with bad habits
Turn around, drop it low, look back at it, damn
A good girl with bad habits
You a good girl with bad habits
If you a good girl with bad habits
Turn around, drop it low, look back at it, damn

[Verse 2]
Girl you got some bad habits, and I ain't talking about them cigarettes
Shawty licked me from head to toe, like a mothafuckin' liquorice (oh my)
You always call me at the right time, take that back, you was probably on a study break (right)
And I know you on your lawyer shit, but soon girl, you gonna have me unemployed and shit
Oh, she said "open up the door" I want to do it to your favorite song
She had a big grey trench coat with no clothes on, it's on

[Hook]
Good girl with bad habits
I love a good girl with bad habits
Good girl with bad habits
Turn around, drop it low, look back at it, damn
Good girl with bad habits
You a good girl with bad habits
If you a good girl with bad habits
Turn around, drop it low, look back at it, damn

[Bridge 1]
She only had three lovers, but I swear she do it better than them other girls
Only under covers, you'd never know it in the real world
All the ballers try to holler at her
She know they just tryna quarterback her
But she fuck with me, I guess it's a fantasy

[Hook]
I love a good girl with bad habits
I love a good girl with bad habits
Good girl with bad habits
Turn around, drop it low, look back at it
I love a good girl with bad habits
I love a good girl with bad habits
Good girl with bad habits
Turn around, drop it low, look back at it, damn
Good girl with bad habits
You a good girl with bad habits
If you a good girl with bad habits
Turn around, drop it low, look back at it, damn

[Outro]
Doing it, doing it, doing it, wild
We be doing it, doing it, doing it, wild
Doing it, doing it, doing it, wild
Tonight girl, we doing it, doing it, doing it, wild
All the good girls put your hands up
I know you wanna have fun too
All the good girls put your hands up
I know you wanna have fun too
