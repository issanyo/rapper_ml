[Verse 1: Romeo Miller]
Look, her fly match mine
She get better with time like fine wine
Call me any hour, just trust I'm on time
Have you in the drop top coupe, Rollie on shine
And no I ain't that clown Hakeem, this Grant work
Ten thousand likes on your pic, that 'Gram work
I be taking dudes' chicks like the repo
Later we can throw back shots like free throws
Whisper in your ear, I got some things I wanna tell you
Your last boyfriend, mmm not on my level
I can love you long time, this the anthem
Hella diamonds on your body steady dancin', Gram

Oh, you like what you see, oh yeah

Now, baby, let me love you, love you, long time
I can make you love you, love you, long time
I'ma put it on you, on you, one time, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Romeo Miller]
Now he ain't complement your style in a while 'cause he a lame
Shopping spree twenty thou to make you smile
You with a baller, we buy the mall we don't browse
You got it on your own, but when I spend you get aroused
Your ex dude, why he steady tryin'?
Hakeem said he better but he lyin'
Private in the sky when we flyin'
We hittin' number one on the charts steady climbin', huh

[Verse 3: Serayah]
Hurt me, hurt me, hurt me
Love me, love me, love me
Tell me that you love me
Put no one above me, yeah
'Cause I'm the one that's gon' put it down yeah
I'm the one that's gon' hold you down
Tell your old chick, I'm the new one
He know that I'm 'bout to put it down, down, down
'Cause I just want you to know I'm the one that's there for you
Ain't none of these chicks gon' hold you down like I do
I want you to love me, love me, long time
Call me, I'ma pull up, pull up no time
Don't make me wait go all the way like yeah, yeah
