[Verse 1]
Now she wanna fuck with me (fuck with me)
Live a life of luxury, models in my money trees
Such beautiful company
Fuck a 9 to 5 I’m seeing dollar signs
But I'm still driving around in my old whip, still living at home
Got issues with my old chick, she blowin' up my phone hot
Talkin ‘bout some bullshit, like who’s this, who’s that
Could be worse, so to calm her nerves
I just tell her

[Hook 1]
Roll up an L and light it, let’s go to space
Be my co, I’ll be the pilot, let’s get away
Let’s get away, let’s get away
Let’s get away, baby let’s get away

[Hook 2]
If money doesn't fall from trees
Maybe we can make believe today
All I need is company
And rest assured, I got it babe

[Verse 2]
Working for the finer things (finer things)
Getting in all kind of ways, pennies all in my champagne
Every day we celebrate (celebrate)
Fuck your little funds, a million ain't enough
But I'm still driving around in my old whip, still living at home
Got, issues with my new chick, she blowin’ up my phone now
All I hear is womp womp, womp womp (womp womp)
But it could be worse, girl, calm your nerves
I want you to

[Hook 1]
Roll up an L and light it, let’s go to space
Be my co-, I’ll be the pilot, let’s get away
Let’s get away, let’s get away
Let’s get away, baby let’s get away

[Hook 2]
Money doesn’t fall from trees
Maybe we can make believe today
All I need is company
And the rest is yours, I promise babe
If money don’t...
