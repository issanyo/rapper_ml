Ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh baby
Ohh, ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh

(Syd)
My heart, it's with you now
But do you know how to love me?
Your heart it beats for me
I'm the only thing you've got to hold onto
My mind tells me to let you go
But my heart said no

(Syd & Lux)
My mind tells me that this is wrong
But your love's too strong
And now I'm caught in the middle
You took away my flashlight
Now I'm walking in the dark
Thinking why'd I even stop to think
That this could be love
Is it too late to turn back now?
Now that I've given you my heart
Before this whole thing falls apart
But could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love?

(Syd)
I'm no longer safe when you look my way
You've become my everything
Is this a mistake?
(Lux)
Baby, when you put put that thing on me
I just can't explain
This is a mistake

(Syd)
And I hate to be selfish, baby
But what about me?
If you leave you take it all

(Lux)
You know I wouldn't leave you, baby
So say you'll be mine
Maybe together we'll find
The words that describe love
If what we both feel inside is love

(Syd & Lux)
You took away my flashlight
Now I'm walking in the dark
Thinking why'd I even stop
To think that this could be love
Is it too late to turn back?
Now that I've given you my heart
Before this whole thing falls apart
But could this be love, love?
Could this be love?
Could this be love, love?
Could this be love? Love, yeah

(Syd & Lux)
Is this in love?
I'm just riding with you
Baby, I hope this never ends
Let's make it last forever

Baby, hold on
Hold on, baby
