[Verse 1]
Tell you what I'm grinding for
Just to see you smile more
Lately I spend all my time
Tryna keep you satisfied
If I can have you all to me
Then I am yours for you to keep
Bring your body close to mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's time I
Turn these lights low
Turn these lights off
Turn these lights low
Second thought, leave 'em on

[Chorus]
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
Leave the lights on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on

[Verse 2]
Splashing in your waterfalls
Now we're totally involved
We get better every time
Learning how to read your mind
You know what I came to do
I ain't playing games with you
I can see it in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You agree it's time I
Turn these lights low
Turn these lights off
Turn these lights low
On second thought, leave 'em on

[Chorus]
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
Leave the lights on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
Leave the lights on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on

[Bridge]
Good sex, good weed, good life I provide
Mami, don't leave me, no
New life for you and I
I know you don't need me, but
Won't you stay up underneath me
'Cause it's great when we're together
When we're not, it ain't too easy
This thing we got is special
Baby you gotta believe me
I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it
Come between us, I won't let nothing if you love me

[Chorus]
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
Leave the lights on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
Leave the lights on
You can, you can leave 'em on
You can leave 'em on
You can, you can leave 'em on
