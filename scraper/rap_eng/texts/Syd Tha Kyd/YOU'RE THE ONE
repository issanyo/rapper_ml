[Verse 1: Syd tha Kyd]
I want you to want me
But you just wanna love me for the day
And I can't just walk away
Even though I know you're trouble, babe

[Bridge: Syd tha Kyd]
So I'mma take my time
Go with the flow, can't get too involved
You got a face that I
Just can't say no to, just can't say no to you

[Hook: Syd tha Kyd]
You know I want you, baby, you know I do
I'll give you my heart and the rest is up to you
You ain't no good for me, I know it's true
But you don't have to be
'Cause I do it for the thrill, for the rush
I do it for the pain, for your touch
Will I OD, when it's too much?
If I survive, baby, you're the one, you're the one

[Verse 2: Syd tha Kyd]
I feel like I'm walking
The tightrope of love in your circus, babe
If I were to fall, it'd be my last day
Even though you're right under me

[Bridge: Syd tha Kyd]
So I'mma take my time
Go with the flow, can't get too involved
You got a face that I
Just can't say no to, just can't say no to you

[Hook: Syd tha Kyd]
You know I want you, baby, you know I do
I'll give you my heart and the rest is up to you
You ain't no good for me, I know it's true
But you don't have to be
'Cause I do it for the thrill, for the rush
I do it for the pain, for your touch
Will I OD, when it's too much?
If I survive, baby you're the one, you're the one

[Interlude: Syd tha Kyd]
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one

[Outro: Syd tha Kyd]
Take my time
Go with the flow, can't get too involved
You got a face that I
Just can't say no to, just can't say no to you
