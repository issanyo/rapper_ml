[Verse 1]
We can conquer the world
Just you and me no one else
Tell me if that’s cool
What chu wanna do
Guns drawn in an all black car
We could rob this world blind if we wanna
And maybe next time we’ll fly

[Chorus]
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me so happy

[Verse 2]
We could conquer the world
Would you be down to roll with me
Like my partner in crime
Till the end of time

[Chorus]
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me so happy

[Verse 3]
We could conquer the world
Just you and me
Mother, tell me tell me, tell me, he [?]
Tell me, tell me, he

[Chorus]
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me so happy

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me
Only you and me so happy

[Outro]
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
It’s just me and you forever
