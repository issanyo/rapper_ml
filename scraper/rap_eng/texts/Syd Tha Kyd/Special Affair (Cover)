[Verse 1]
Penny for your thoughts, I know what you want
I can read your mind even from behind
And fuck what's in your phone, I can take you home
I wanna take you home

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's so rare that I'm here, don't plan on staying too long
So you should come here, sit your ass on this throne
This a special affair, better act like you know who I am, who I am

[Chorus]
I bet this Patron make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna act nice, girl, your cover's blown
But you already knew that
You already knew that
You already knew that

[Post-Chorus]
We can burn one
We can burn one

[Verse 2]
Penny for your thoughts, I know what you want
I can read your mind even from behind
And fuck what's in your phone, I can take you home
I wanna take you home

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it's so rare that I'm here, don't plan on staying too long
So you should come here, sit your ass on this throne
This a special affair, better act like you know who I am, who I am

[Chorus]
I bet this Patron make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna act nice, girl, your cover's blown
But you already knew that
You already knew that
You already knew that

[Post-Chorus]
We can burn one
We can burn one
