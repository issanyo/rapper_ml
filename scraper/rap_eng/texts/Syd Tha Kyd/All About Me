[Verse 1]
I be more than a god in my dreams, it's wishful thinking
I sleep more than I need to, I drink more on the weekend
I eat all meat but fish, I keep my niggas with me
I see sharks in the water, I fiend for marijuana
I pray for all my homies, I'm lyin’, at least I try
I say that she’s my only but got you on my mind
Today I'm only human, but know that when I die
My grave gone be my music, my soul is living through it baby

[Chorus]
Take care of the family that you came with
We made it this far and it’s amazing
People drowning all around me
So I keep my squad around me
Keep it in the family that you came with
Keep enemies close you know the basics
People crowded all around me
I guess it’s all about me

[Verse 2]
We gettin’ checks in the mail, I don’t know if you could tell
Stackin’ this bread on the shelf, stackin’ my bread on the shelf
I see you mad at yourself, I see them mad at themselves
I hear ‘em crying for help, I hear ‘em crying for help
Don’t be mad if I switch up, my good taste got me this much
Too sweet for your taste buds, I seen you sleepin’ hoe wake up
They ain’t know what sauce was till we served it offa that tonka
Drizzled all on your lobster, put shame to your roster
Me broke, girl dream on, my team on, my weed strong
Need more of what we on, my league always D1
We ball all season, Kobe’s on my feet bruh
Pay attention to me bruh, pay me my fee bruh
You seek answers to questions ‘bout me, it’s in my music
You preach bout revolution and dreams, I really do this
I lead by my example, I see fame as a nuisance
I don’t take it for granted but god dammit
Sometimes I can’t stand it

[Chorus]
Take care of the family that you came with
We made it this far and it’s amazing
People drowning all around me
So I keep my squad around me
Keep it in the family that you came with
Keep yo haters close you know the basics
People got they arms around me
That’s cause it’s all about me
