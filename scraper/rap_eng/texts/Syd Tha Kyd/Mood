[Verse 1]
You just a girl I came to know
I thought you were relatable
You ask me out, ok for sure
I make myself available
You say, "Ok, then it's a date"
I say I'll pick you up at 8
We take the fancy car valet
I'll wine and dine ya until it's time, girl

[Verse 2]
The conversation is a must
You look amazing, that's a plus
My crib is close, I just cleaned up
I text my bros, they wish me luck (Ay)
Stop for a bottle on the way
Twist up the trees that's on the tray
Put my intentions on display
Right now, I want you, can I get closer?

[Chorus]
I compliment you on the nice road
You wearing something kinda nice too
I'm trying to get you in the right mood
Let me get you in the right mood
If I hit it the right way
Can I get a night too?
Let me get you in the right mood
I could get you in the right mood

[Verse 3]
Now that I got you all alone
Let's crack the wine, let's call a toast
Please have a seat, get comfortable
I'll try not to fuck up the flow (Nah)
Right where I want you
I'll check my posture, come at you proper, girl
Something about you
Climbed onto cloud nine, you lay on my couch
Heart beatin' like

[Bridge]
You feel it right?

[Chorus]
I compliment you on the nice road
You wearing something kinda nice too
I'm trying to get you in the right mood
Let me get you in the right mood
If I hit it the right way
Can I get a night too?
Let me get you in the right mood
I can get you in the right mood

[Outro]
(Hey, you feeling good right?)
(Oh, I know)
Baby, next time I'll bring you flowers
Roses, exotic daisies
Next time I'll take you out
Girl, don't you keep me waiting
Next time I'll bring you flowers
Roses, exotic daisies
Next time I take you out
Girl, don't you keep me waiting
Next time I'll bring you flowers
Roses, exotic daisies
Next time I take you out
Girl, don't you keep me waiting
Next time I'll bring you flowers
Roses, exotic daisies
Next time I take you out
Girl, don't you-
