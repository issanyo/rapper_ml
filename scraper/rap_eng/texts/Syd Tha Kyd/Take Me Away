[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
Now it's time to sit back and enjoy creation
See what Jah has done
Every time she tops me off, it's celebration, yeah
What has life become?
And we don't talk too much
Could this be a strange new love I've got
Plus she's always got that loud pack
Inspiration for this soundtrack
Every time she throws that ass back, all she says is

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
Every time I go inside of your protected
Place with reverence
I'm reminded of a time I was neglected
It seems you're heaven sent
She loves to top me off
She's cut from the finest cloth, my love
Plus, we like to take it easy
All she wants to do is please me
Every time I'm on that TV, calls me up, says

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & Syd]
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away (Won't you please take me away baby, 'way baby)
(Won't you please take me away)
Take me away (I like the way you say my name baby, name baby)
(Won't you please take me away)
Take me away
Take me away

[Outro: Syd]
Wherever you go, just take me, take me, take me
Would you take me, baby
Take (Take me away)
Want you take me away, take me away (Take me)
Take me away, take me away
If it's the last thing
Want you to take me away, take me away (Take me)
Take me away, take me away
Take me
