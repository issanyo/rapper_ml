[Intro]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey

[Verse 1: Syd tha Kyd]
Going out I was on the road
To places that you never know
They asked us to put on a show
So we go, fly away

The sky went to the South of France
Switzerland to Amsterdam
Traveling across the land
Rain or snow, everyday

[Hook]
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me

[Bridge]
You go away from me
You go away from me

[Verse 2: Syd tha Kyd]
I'm sorry that I went away
Wipe the smile from your face
Soon I'll be back to save the day
This we know so don't you cry no no

I know you hate to see me go
But you should know you're not alone
I wish that you could tag along
But you know that I'm coming home

[Hook]
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
I don't want to
Think about you leavin' on me
Hop up on me
