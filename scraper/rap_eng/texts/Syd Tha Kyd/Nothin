It's like... you just never know
You never know

[Verse 1]
I got a whole lotta liquor in me
Whole lotta little things on my mind
I got a girl on the other side of town
She wonders why I never come around

I've got all these insecurities a woman can't fix
And now I know that liquor and depression don't mix
Where to now?
Nothing to lose now

[Pre-Chorus]
Bounce
I was headed towards my fate
Until somewhere I lost my way
Something's gotta give right now
So this is what it is right now

[Chorus]
All the nothin', nothin', nothin'
All the nothin', nothin'
Didn't work this hard for nothin', nothin', nothin'
So I'm gonna act up, I'm gon' act up, gon' stack up when I cash out

[Verse 2]
Didn't work this hard for
Didn't work this hard for
Success is overrated
I could be the greatest
Maybe 'cause I'm faded or I'm heavily sedated, but
I'm just tryna make it, I'm just tryna make it
And no, I don't need the fame
I just need to make some changes, so

Please forgive me this isn't the kinda image I
Wanted to paint for you, hope you don't think I'm crazy, now
Real art is amazing, ain't that a shame?
You the greatest in the game, gettin' faded for the pain
So we all bounce

[Pre-Chorus]
Bounce
I can't live like this
Something's gotta give right now
So this is what it is right now

[Chorus]
All the nothin', nothin', nothin'
All the nothin', nothin'
Didn't work this hard for nothin', nothin', nothin'
So I'm gonna act up, I'm gon' act up, gon' stack up when I cash out

[Pre-Chorus]
Bounce
I can't live like this
Something's gotta give right now
So this is what it is right now

[Chorus]
All the nothin', nothin', nothin'
All the nothin', nothin'
Didn't work this hard for nothin', nothin', nothin'
So I'm gonna act up, I'm gon' act up, gon' stack up when I cash out
