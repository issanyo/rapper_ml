[Verse 1: Tay Walker]
Baby, when I tell you that you've got
Everything that I ever wanted and though
Lady, please don't think I'm just running my gums
Just running my gums

I can go on forever about how you can
Make the good things better, now that we made
It through the stormy weather
Let's enjoy the sun
Let's enjoy the sun

[Chrous]
You give me a good feeling
You give me a good feeling
You give me a good feeling
You make me feel good

[Verse 2: Syd Bennet]
Baby, if they don't agree that you're
Amazing, it's obvious that they're playing
Crazy, can you blame them?
They're just envious
They're just envious

Lately, when they ask about us I say you're
My lady, but it's so easy, cause you're so
Fascinating, so interesting
Girl, you're something else
Girl, you're something else

[Chorus: Tay Walker]
You give me a good feeling
You give me a good feeling
You give me a good feeling
You make me feel good

[Bridge]
You're like a waterfall pool in the summertime
When I'm around you I'm on number nine, number nine
I'm on number nine
I swear this little love of mine's got me floating

[Outro]
I'm floating, floating again
I'm soaking, soaking it in
I'm floating, floating again
I'm soaking, soaking it in
