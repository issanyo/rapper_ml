[Verse 1: Mike G]
Im saying hello summer make the others wonder
How i been this dope since I was creeping on the come up
I can give you what you wanna
Nights & In the morning, its your main enjoyment
Seems like you can't find anything funner
Things i say make you wanna stay, smoking all day
Parking lot play, bumping UGK
Heavy on the gas pedal so you must respect this
Bars on some next level get me girls from Texas
Florida, GA, Illinois to VA
New York, Minnesota, Seattle to where we stay
Top notch girls get the most not the lesser
Got 25 gold lighters on my dresser

(Hook) (x2)
I suggest you chill yourself baby, keep your composure
Talk a little less baby dance a lil slower
My Patience wearing thin when the night is almost over
I Know the seasons change when my heart is getting colder

[Verse 2: Speak!]
Quote the raven never more
Hopping out like border wars
Drinking at the Roosevelt, We buying things we can't afford
What's that wine we can't pronounce
Get the check split and bounce
Revolver with the rubber soles
Honey meet me at the lounge
You wanna ask why i called you in the first place
Crimson and clover babe i need you in the worst ways
Used to do relate so meet you there at 8
They sat you down i stood you up
Been to know to make you wait
And for that i do apologize
Red Dress, Olive Eyes
Attention in the short supply, and your demanding all of mine
Well that's impossible, mind state tropical
Roam the earth like juggernauts, so violent and unstoppable
You'll never get a hold of him, tears you gotta hold them in
12 roses wrap in arrogance, im sending my condolences
Gone before the mourn, calm before the storm
You curse my name and hate my soul
I wish i wasn't born

(Hook) (x2)

[Verse 3: Mike G]
Im sayin dear winter give me something to remember
My presence is a present i bring more gift in december
Red and green stripes on the clothes i can tell
Shes a winner she could kill them all
Leave no competition no contenders
Thats how you feel? i can only keep it real since jack frost
So cold make these women wanna chill
You fit the bill and i got some time to kill
As long as you dont mind i keep my mind on mils
When you guys lookin at me has me thinking whats the deal
Im either too good at this game or your hearts not hard to steal
Im being modest at times its hard to conceal you know i got em like
Duce continentals and coup deviles so just know you got now
Dont worry about whos next apologies if feelings get hurt in this process
I told you i wouldn't leave i never said you could stay sit waiting for the give and go they go and give you away

(Hook) (x2)
