Part 1: Just Sayin

[Intro]
Rock babe
Rock babe
Rock babe
Rock babe
I don’t love you no more (Rock babe)
I don’t love you no more (Rock babe)
I don’t love you no more (Rock babe)
I don’t love you no more (Rock babe)

[Verse 1]
Used to be you and me, young and in love
Honestly used to think love was enough
Tell me who I gotta be to get you out from under me
Don't need you all up under me
I already moved on
Was in love with you for too long

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah, I’m just sayin’
Yeah, I’m just sayin’, girl
I’m not trying to hurt your feelings
But I gotta say it, girl

[Hook]
(You fucked up) Now I don't even want you
Can’t believe I wrote another song about you
(You fucked up) You made another mistake
Now you know that I’m not the type that you can replace
(You fucked up) Now I don’t even want you
And I noticed that I’m better off without you
(You fucked up) Now that I got some cash flow
And I have everything that I’ve ever asked for
(You fucked up)

[Verse 2]
You’re talkin’ like you got a shot, changin’ my mind
But I know better than that, you’re wasting your time
Tell me what it gotta be to get you out from under me
Don't need you all up under me
I already moved on
Was in love with you for too long

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah, I’m just sayin’
Yeah, I’m just sayin’, girl
I’m not trying to hurt your feelings
I gotta say it, girl

[Hook]
(You fucked up) Now I don't even want you (no)
Can’t believe I wrote another song about you
(You fucked up) You made another mistake
Now you know that I’m not the type that you can replace
(You fucked up) Now I don’t even want you
And I noticed that I’m better off without you
(You fucked up) Now that I got some cash flow
And I have everything that I ever asked for

[Outro]
(You fucked up)
(You fucked up)
(You fucked up)
Look, don’t be calling on my phone no more, please
(You fucked up)
It's over, peace
(You fucked up)
I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more

Part 2: I Tried

[Verse 1]
Got a letter from an old flame the other day
Envelope, had a scent reminiscent of May
Said she’s doing just fine, that I’ve been on her mind and
That she wishes that I never ever went away
I gave it all I had just to let it go
But you should know that I tried

[Hook]
I tried, I tried
I tried, just know that I tried
That I tried, I tried
I tried

[Verse 2]
Got a call from an old friend the other night
He said that he just saw you, and you’re living the life
We were always best friends
It all came to an end and things change
One day I hope you realize

[Hook]
I tried, I tried
I tried, I tried
Girl, I tried, yeah, I tried
I tried, I tried

[Bridge]
Maybe one day we’ll find common ground
When the weather’s warm and the trees are green
Maybe when the leaves start falling
Maybe then we’ll find ourselves together again

[Verse 3]
That’s it, my seeds are there in your garden
I fell in love with smoke and mirrors
The spring, I guess we’ll see if we blossom
Or are we just fallen petals? Is it autumn?

[Outro]
Maybe one day we’ll find common ground
When the ocean’s cold and the pigs all fly
Maybe when the sky starts falling
