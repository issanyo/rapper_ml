I thought of this song while I was sleeping in your arms
Late last night night
What I wanted to say was I love you forever
But it didn't come out right
All I could say was I'm cold give me covers
Could you turn out the light?
And we laughed at ourselves for our serious nature
And what could have been a fight

You know I've been watching you all day long
The way we look at each other
The way you sing our songs
I can't wait till we get home
Because that's when I know
At the end of the day I'm the one who calls you baby

When you walk down the street they all stop and they stare
You know the way it is out there
He's either looking at you or he's looking at me
Get in the car, give me the keys
Let's drive down the middle of the city block
Roll down these windows and show them what I got
I found this sweet thing out there
But she's mine and not yours so what do you care?

I'm the one who calls you baby in the morning
I'm the who gets to tuck you in at night
I'm the one who says baby forever Baby together
Everything's just fine

You know I've been watching you all day long
The way we laugh at each other
The way you sing our songs
I can't wait till we get home
Because that's when I know

At the end of the day I'm the one who calls you baby

Thought of this song while I was sleeping in your arms
Late last night
What I wanted to say was I love you forever
But it didn't come out right

You know I've been watching you all day long
The way we look at each other
The way you sing our songs
I can't wait till we get home
Because that's when I know
At the end of the day I'm the one who calls you baby
