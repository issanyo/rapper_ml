[Verse 1: Sampha]
You've been acting like the coldest, huh
Don't think I didn't notice
You've been traveling alonest
You're from Gaia just like Cronus
People acting like they own us
It feels like no one knows us
If you're growing up with no love
Put your hands in the soil and you can grow love

[Chorus: Syd]
Swear I feel it everywhere
So much ego in the air
Think I've seen it all before
I know I can see some more
But if I die before I wake
Then I hope I made a change
I know what my purpose was
Show love, show love

[Verse 2: Syd]
I've been working overtime
I've got plenty on my mind
I've been out here moving mountains
Turning pennies into dimes
Tell your neighbors I'm on the rise
Trading favors for all the lights
Made a name, it was no surprise
Made a few mistakes, yeah and I paid the price

[Bridge: Sampha]
I've been 'round long enough to know
Life is up and down, see-saw
I've got to veto my ego
I'll go where she go

[Chorus: Syd]
Swear I feel it everywhere
So much ego in the air
Think I've seen it all before
I know I can see some more
But if I die before I wake
Then I hope I made a change
I know what my purpose was
Show love, show love

[Outro: Sampha & Syd]
You've grown up to show love
There's no love unless you own up
No love, toes up
Show love, show love
You've grown up to show love
There's no love unless you own up
No love, your toes up
Ooh, you've got to show
You've got to show
So show love, so show love, yeah
So show love, so show love
(What a beautiful daydream)
Show love, show love
(What a beautiful daydream)
Show love, show love
