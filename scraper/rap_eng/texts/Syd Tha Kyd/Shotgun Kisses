Title: Shotgun Kisses
Artist: Ngan
Project: Smell The Roses

[Verse 1]
Ya lips I'm missing
Can't stand this distance
Want to feel pure bliss
Get lifted
Off these feelings that i'm feeling

[Chorus]
So high and so shy
So fly and so right
So high and so shy
So alive off these shotgun kisses

Shot gun, shot gun, shot gun
(Ay)
Shot gun, shot gun, shot gun
(Ay)
Shot gun, shot gun, shot gun
(Ay)
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Bang bang

[Hook]
U make me feel like i'm on dope, dope
I really wanna another dose, dose
U make me feel like i'm on dope, dope
I really wanna another dose, dose

[Verse 2]
Could you rock my boat
Get real close
Tell me what it is u wanna do to me
And where we could go
Rock my boat
Get real close
Tell me what it is u wanna do to me
And where we could go

[Chorus]
So high and so shy
So fly and so right
So high and so shy
So alive off these shotgun kisses

Shot gun, shot gun, shot gun
(kiss)
Shot gun, shot gun, shot gun
(kiss)
Shot gun, shot gun, shot gun
(kiss)
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Bang bang

[Bridge]
Love, you are the love of my life
Love, you are the love of my life
Love, you are the love of my life
I got no one else on my mind
You give me life

[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah, I
Ah, ah, ah, I
Ah, ah, ah, I
Ah, ah, ah, I
Ah, ah, ah, I
Ah, ah, ah, I
Love
