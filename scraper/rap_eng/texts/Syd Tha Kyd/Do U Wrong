[Chorus: Syd]
Baby won't you let me ride?
Tell me what you like
I can't read your mind
Bad as I want to, I really want you so
Baby won't you let me ride?
Tell me what you like
I can't read your mind
Bad as I want to, I really want you, girl

[Verse 1: Syd]
You could be the one, you could be my favorite
We could be in love if we keep datin'
Baby, I could beat it up, I can catch the fade with it
Take the mask off, I can put my face in it
You ain't gotta trip, we can vacation
Take you all around the world and give you paper planes
If I only hit it once, it would be a shame, wouldn't it?
Tell me what you want, I'm tired of debating

[Pre-Chorus: Syd]
'Cause I can do you wrong if you want, babe
Would it keep me on your mind long enough, babe?
Should I be nice? Should I be rude?
Do I text twice? Do I play cool?
I can do it all if you want, baby

[Chorus: Syd & Leven Kali]
Baby won't you let me ride?
Tell me what you like
I can't read your mind
Bad as I want to, I really want you so
Baby won't you let me ride?
Tell me what you like
I can't read your mind
Bad as I want to, I really want you, girl

[Verse 2: Leven Kali]
Oh you can be the one, you can be the only
If you wanna be my girl or just the homie
I can give you love, I can play it cool for you
I can pick you up or send a pool for you
If I use my tongue, baby would you like that?
If you wanna bite, baby girl, I bite back
I can show you somethin', this could be a lesson
So tell me what you want, I'm tired of the guessin', baby

[Pre-Chorus: Leven Kali]
I can do you wrong if you want, babe
Would it keep me on your mind long enough, baby?
Should I be nice? Should I be rude?
Do I text twice? Do I play cool?
I can do you wrong if you want, baby

[Chorus: Leven Kali & Syd]
Baby won't you let me ride?
Tell me what you like
I can't read your mind
Bad as I want to, I really want you so
Baby won't you let me ride?
Tell me what you like
I can't read your mind
Bad as I want to, I really want you, girl

[Bridge: Leven Kali & Syd]
Oh, I really want you, girl
Oh, what I want, yeah
I can't read your mind, I can't read your mind
I can't read your mind, I, I can't read your mind
I can't read your mind, I can't read your mind
I can't read your mind, I, I can't read your mind
Baby won't you let me ride?

[Outro: Leven Kali]
Baby won't you let me ride?
Tell me what you like
I can't read your mind
Bad as I want to
Baby won't you let me ride?
Tell me what you like
I can't read your mind
Bad as I want to, I really want you, girl
