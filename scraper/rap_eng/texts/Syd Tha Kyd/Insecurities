[Verse 1]
You can thank my insecurities
For keeping me around you babe
I pack my bags but never leave
'Cause it’s so hard to walk away
You know I love you girl
Maybe more than I love myself
But in a perfect world
I would be with somebody else
And I wanna know

[Chorus]
Who can love you like I love you baby (baby)
Never thought that I would ever see the day
That I’d walk away
Now I’m walking away
Who can give you what I gave you baby (baby)
Never thought that I would ever see the day
That I’d walk away
Now I’m walking away

[Verse 2]
You can thank my insecurities
They’re the reason I was down so long
I’m hoping that you’re hearing me
Or do I need a microphone
Honestly I’m not ashamed
Baby who are we to blame
With you my love it’s all the same
Ain’t nothing ever gonna change

[Chorus]
Who can love you like I love you baby (baby)
Never thought that I would ever see the day
That I’d walk away
Now I’m walking away
Who can give you what I gave you baby (baby)
Never thought that I would ever see the day
That I’d walk away
Now I’m walking away

[Bridge]
And baby
I gotta walk away
I really loved you girl
But something’s gotta change
And, I say I’ll leave you tomorrow
But what about today
Nah, I ain’t calling you the devil but
I rebuke your evil ways

[Outro]
So thank my insecurities
Just thank my insecurities
You can thank my insecurities
Just thank my insecurities…
