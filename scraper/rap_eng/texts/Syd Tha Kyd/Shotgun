[Verse 1: Little Simz]
Oh, it's official when you know it
Don't say nothin' if you can't show it
Boy, are you a talker or a doer?
Victim or the shooter?
Let me know now 'cause
Theres some niggas that wish they knew her
I'm a complex human being
Man theres more than one side to me
I'm all ears when you need that
You should confide in me
If there's one thing that I ask for
Honesty, don't lie to me
Been dolo for a long time
This is God's sign
Let me know when you're on
I'm in the OK space, got my own place
Drive my own whip, run my own ship
All that's missin' is a co-pilot
Ride shotgun with me, wish you not fight this when I roll out one on my hip

[Hook: Syd]
When I'm out, you know I got one
If you don't then you better cop one
'Cause I always keep 'em rolling shotgun, shotgun, shotgun
Too many for me to keep up
So I never leave home without one
And I always keep 'em rolling shotgun, shotgun, shotgun

[Verse 2: Little Simz]
Oh, caught in the cross fire
My ex nigga wanna know me, lookin' all fire
No, this shouldn't even be my focus right now
I aspire to inspire, way before I'ma retire
That's the shit I live by every day
We can do this if you on it
I'm not tryna play games
Talk to me proper, do not try and spit game
Simz, I'm just tryna get to know you, no you don't say?
Your the girl of my dreams, no you don't say?
I'ma be a minute so you better not wait
Company is maybe all I needed right now
And you're an easy target
Don't take that the wrong way
But ride shotgun with me aye

[Hook: Syd]
When I'm out, you know I got one
If you don't then you better cop one
'Cause I always keep 'em rolling shotgun, shotgun, shotgun
Too many for me to keep up
So I never leave home without one
And I always keep 'em rolling shotgun, shotgun, shotgun

[Bridge: Syd]
Can't trust just anyone that you meet on the street
That's why I always keep a piece
Don't try to test me
Please, they come in all shapes and sizes
So don't come with no surprises
I ain't got time, baby
Got time

[Verse 3: Little Simz]
Oh, gotta see it to believe
Always keep it 100, I didn't come to deceive
I know you probably have wondered if this was ever to be
Got love for you in abundance, never worth a discussion
You entertain interruptions, what's with you and assumptions?
Damn it, I shoulda known why these niggas is hoes
Shoulda put you to work and kept you up on your toes
Shoulda listened to Bibi, you're condescendin' and needy
Don't start today, play with my heart today
Won't last a day, it's what the haters say
Now we're partin' ways, you are far from brave
Wasn't worth the time but oh boy, you fine

[Hook: Syd]
When I'm out, you know I got one
If you don't then you better cop one
'Cause I always keep 'em rolling shotgun, shotgun, shotgun
Too many for me to keep up
So I never leave home without one
And I always keep 'em rolling shotgun, shotgun, shotgun

[Outro: Little Simz & Syd]
It's a stick up, put your hands in the air like it's a stick up
It's a stick up, put your hands in the air like it's a stick up
Yeah, it's a stick up, put your hands in the air like it's a stick up
Yeah, that's right, it's a stick up, put your hands in the air like it's a stick up
