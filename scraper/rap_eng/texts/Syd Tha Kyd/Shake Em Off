[Intro]
Hello?
What’s good…
Nah I’m fine…
Yeah…

[Verse 1]
I’m drowning in doubt and frustration
Can't sleep 'cause I’m anxious
Counting sheep and all
I’m sipping some liquor, go figure
Getting lit with my niggas 'cause we done seen it all
Don’t worry 'bout what I’m doing
What’s it to you if I live dazed and confused?
This isn’t for your amusement, this ain't no pay per view
It’s just the life that I choose

[Chorus]
Shake 'em off
Shake 'em off
Shake 'em off
There's nothing you can tell me, I'm grown
Shake 'em off
Shake 'em off
Shake 'em off
I’d rather you say nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, now I'm pacing
Young star in the making
Swear they sleeping on me
They pump me up to deflate me
I'm so close I can taste it, oh you don't even know (nah)
Don’t worry 'bout how I'm living
It’s none of your business
Who I'm with or where I stay (don't trip)
I told em but they wouldn't listen
Now they praying and wishing
To be me for the day
So I say

[Chorus]
Shake 'em off
Shake 'em off
Shake 'em off
There's nothing you can tell me, I'm grown
Shake 'em off
Shake 'em off
Shake 'em off
I’d rather you say nothing at all

[Outro]
Gone
