[Hook]
I know you wanted to fly
So hop up in my spaceship girl
I'll guarantee to get you high
I know you wanted to fly
So hop up in my spaceship girl
I'll guarantee to get you high

[Bridge]
Why don't you get away with me, come inside
When we're together, you and I

[Hook]
I know you wanted to fly
So hop up in my spaceship girl
I'll guarantee to get you high
I know you wanted to fly
So hop up in my spaceship girl
I'll guarantee to get you high
