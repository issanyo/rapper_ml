[Part 1: Next Time]

[Verse]
You were nothing but a momental face
You were only five minutes away
Shoulda met you when I had the chance
'Cause I'll probably never see you again

[Pre-Chorus]
My, oh, my
I'm wondering if
She knows I
Was plottin' on her
Does she come here often?
If so I gotta
Make a move, quit stallin'
It's hard to gauge with my heart racing
This back and forth is energy wasted
But what do I say if I see hesitation?
But what do I do if she walks away?

[Chorus]
Next time, I'll just start by saying hi
Ask her what her name is
If she has the time
Start a conversation
No, we don't have to talk for too long
I just wanna know
That before she could leave
I walked over and said hello
I said hello

[Pre-Chorus]
Say, baby
Don't hate me
Scratch that, you probably gon' hate me
I'll probably drive myself crazy
My mind, the cloud is so hazy
But, shawty would you be mine?
But can I be the one you get wit' in the meantime?
I mean it
Tell me what you think
Say if you were me
Would you come and speak
Or tell me would you

[Chorus]
Stop by, saying hi (Hi)
Ask her what her name is (Wha'cha name, bae?)
If she has the time
Start a conversation
No, we don't have to talk for too long
I just wanna know
That before she could leave
I walked over and said hello
Said hello

[Part 2: Humble Pie]

[Verse 1]
Aimless dreaming
Tell me why you sleeping
It's yourself, you're cheating in the end
This shit ain't easy
Baby, please believe me
Don't know what you're thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you need a real love (ooh ooo, aah)
You gotta love something (ooh ooo, aah)
You know it's still love (ooh ooo, aah)
But you ain't doing nothing (ooh ooo, aah)
Damn

[Chorus]
I've been clockin' in
Night and day (Night and day)
It's working out for me
And you wonder why
No, you ain't hungry yet
Me, I got a plate (got a plate)
But I don't want a piece of your humble pie (humble pie)

[Verse 2]
All this wisdom, but you never listen
Now you stuck just wishing for the best
Assume the system gave you special privilege
But ain't nothing given

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you need a real love (Love) (ooh ooo, aah)
You gotta love something (ooh ooo, aah)
And you know it's still love (Love) (ooh ooo, aah)
But you ain't doing nothing, nothing, damn (ooh ooo, aah)

[Chorus]
I've been clockin' in
Night and day (Night and day)
It's working out for me
And you wonder why
No, you ain't hungry yet
Me, I got a plate (got a plate)
But I don't want a piece of your humble pie (humble pie)

[Outro]
(ooh ooo, aah)
(ooh ooo, aah)
(ooh ooo, aah)
(ooh ooo, aah)
