[Verse 1]
My love, I thought you knew
This karma thing, don't pick and choose
So every time that you perform
I learn just a little more
What a waste, babe, what a shame
You were playing games

[Chorus]
Words come out your mouth
Look around, what a mess you made
Watching from the crowd, it's astounding
You're on your way
Thought that you had changed
I found out it's just a role you play
Well bravo, baby
Bravo, baby oh

[Verse 2]
My love let's get this straight
This ain't your show, this ain't your stage
So no more standing ovations, Broadway plays baby
Save it for the main stage, baby
Go back to where you came from, came from

[Chorus]
Words come out your mouth
Look around, what a mess you made
Watching from the crowd, it's astounding
You're on your way
Thought that you had changed
I found out it's just a role you play
Well bravo, baby
Bravo, baby yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Look

[Outro]
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
I'm saying
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Damn
Ooh yeah
My, my, my, my, my
Ooh yeah
My, my, my, my, my
Ooh yeah
Yeah
