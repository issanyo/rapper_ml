Web For Me - The Internet

(Small Laughter Intro)

I hope you notice the lack of social contact
Its not that your not all that
It's just I know how this will end
Don't try to say you'll change for me
But thats not the way to go
And even before
I don't wanna try again with you
Thats not the move, Nooo

Your jus caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
Its you not me

Your jus caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
Its you not me

And you should know
I never tried to hurt you girl
Just got tangled up in the idea of being together
We can live different lives
Together, Gotta move on
Just let it go, Move on
I'm not the one for you and I know it

Call me you need me
I got chu
Dont call in vain
Cus im warning you
You might regret it
Ask me for help and im running
But make sure its real
Or this friendshipâ€™s over

Your jus caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
Its you not me

Your jus caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
Its you not me

Your jus caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
Its you not me

Your jus caught up in a web of me
Don't realize the reason why we never speak
Its you not me
