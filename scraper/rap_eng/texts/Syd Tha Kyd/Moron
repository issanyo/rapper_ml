[Chorus]
Caught a feel I didn't wanna catch
She's over me, I want her back
Why does it happen to me?
Gotta move on, I got about 3
Girls I can call
Anytime, but I only want her
I don't know why

[Verse]
Girl, was it somethin I said?
You killed my confidence
And left my heart broken
And now I
Can't get you off my mind
Damn what a waste of time
I've spent on you
I'm such a fool, ohhhh

[Chorus]
Caught a feel I didn't wanna catch
She's over me, I want her back
Why does it happen to me?
Gotta move on, I got about 3
Girls I can call
Anytime, but I only want her
I don't know why

[Bridge Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Caught a feel I didn't wanna catch
She's over me, I want her back
Why does it happen to me?
Gotta move on, I got about 3
Girls I can call
Anytime, but I only want her
I don't know why

Girls I can call
Anytime, but I only want her
I don't know why

Girls I can call
Anytime, but I only want her
I don't know why
