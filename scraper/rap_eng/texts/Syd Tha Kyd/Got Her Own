[Chorus]
I heard she got her own
Heard she drive a Beemer and she got it on her own
Heard she was a dreamer but she sleeping all alone
I just wanna meet her 'cause I just wanna know
I heard she got her own
Heard she got her own
And I just wanna know
But I heard she got her own
Got her own

[Verse 1]
You try impress her with your money
You don't know she got her own money
She has an eye for the finer things, I'm
Loving your wings, girl, they're fly to me, I
Know you seen her in the magazines, your
Aunty might hate, but it's flattering, girl
You by yourself is a tragedy
I got trees in my bag, we can smoke
But I heard she got her own

[Chorus]
Heard she got her own
Heard she drive a Beemer and she got it on her own
Heard she was a dreamer but she sleeping all alone
I just wanna meet her 'cause I just wanna know
I heard she got her own
Heard she got her own
And I just wanna know
But I heard she got her own
Got her own

[Verse 2]
You try undress her, but she say no
You try to sex her, but she say no
You thought your jewelry, your fancy clothes would
Keep her from leaving and going home, well
Boy you thought wrong, you weren't even close
She's out of your league, I heard she's a pro
Where she gets her stats, you don't need to know
But they say she's a freak on the low
And I heard she got her own

[Chorus]
Heard she got her own
Heard she drive a Beemer and she got it on her own
Heard she was a dreamer but she sleeping all alone
I just wanna meet her 'cause I just wanna know
I heard she got her own
Heard she got her own
And I just wanna know
But I heard she got her own
Got her own
