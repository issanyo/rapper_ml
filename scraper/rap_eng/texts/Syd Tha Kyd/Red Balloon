When I was young I
Fell in love with you
You were my balloon
When you left I
Called upon the rain
Now you sit in skies of grey
Hoped we meet another day
But you up and flew away
I'm moving on
Told myself that one day I'd find you
My red balloon, my red balloon
Said don't fly away, help me fly away
When I get older I plan to follow you
In my new hot air balloon
When I'm bored I
I can get so high, high, high
In my champagne golden sky
