[Verse 1]
I'm in trouble now
I done fucked around with your heart
It's a struggle now
Should have never messed with your love, sugar
Now the question is, hmm
Do I wanna sink or swim?

[Chorus]
Feels like I'm treading water
Waiting on your call
And it's getting harder
Trying not to drown
Come on, baby, ooh
Come on, baby, come back to me

[Refrain]
One time for the girls that don't
Let just anyone rock that boat
All the ones who know that
They're legit, confidence, gotta show that
Two times for the guys that wait
He ain't heard back in like three, four days
He's just tryna figure you out

[Verse 2]
Don't make me walk the plank
When I call your name, you walk away
They gave me too much to drink
To numb the pain, I'm too dumb to think
I'm sending out an S.O.S. for our love
Sending out an S.O.S. for our love

[Chorus]
Feels like I'm treading water
Waiting on your call
And it's getting harder
Trying not to drown
Come on, baby, woah
Come on, baby, come back to me

[Refrain]
One time for the girls that don't
Let just anyone rock that boat
All the ones who know that
They're legit, confidence, gotta show that
Two times for the guys that wait
He ain't heard back in like three, four days
He's just tryna figure you out

[Outro]
It's all about love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
Hey, it's all about love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
All about love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
It's all about love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Come on, come on, yeah
