[Verse 1: Syd]
You ain't gotta do too much
It's written all over your face
Maybe we can keep in touch
I'll call you when I come around, hope you pick up (hello?)
But you know that this is useless
No need to make excuses
We both know what the truth is, love (ayy)
We been getting distant
Let's go about our business
I'm suited up

[Chorus: Syd]
Is it safe to say it's over? (Over)
Now (Over)
I think it's safe to say it's over
Is it safe to say it's over? (Over)
Over (Over)
I think it's safe to say it's over

[Verse 2: Syd]
Won't call this a waste of time (nah)
But I can only speak for myself
Lately it's been crossing my mind
I'm moving on, you're moving on, it won't be long
'Til we come to the conclusion
That we can't be exclusive
No we can't be exclusive, no (no, no, no)
Ain't nothin' we ain't used to
We don't talk like we used to
We used to, no

[Chorus: Syd]
Is it safe to say it's over? (Over)
Now (Over)
I think it's safe to say it's over
Is it safe to say it's over? (Over)
Over (Over)
I think it's safe to say it's over

[Verse 3: 6LACK]
Safe to say, I was right
You was wrong, that's okay
Love was broke, love was lost
Love was poor, section 8
Safe to say I'm in your head
And you probably want me dead
That's a little extreme
I don't rule out anything, because
Love make a nigga do shit that he don't wanna
Why would you agree if you ain't build for the drama?
Meditation, conversation and a little marijuana
I know when shit ain't right
You can act if you wanna, girl
I don't wanna say too much
And I don't wanna make assumptions
But lately I've been giving no fucks
You love me, but I'm fucking with you from afar
No I don't want confusion, this love was an illusion
We don't know what we doing love
How we gon' look for help when you don't know yourself?
