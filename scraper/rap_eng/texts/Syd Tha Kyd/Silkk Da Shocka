[Intro: Isaiah Rashad]
Yeah, I almost got this
At least we got it memorized
This for the haves and the haves-wanna-give-a-fucks, hey

[Verse 1: Isaiah Rashad & Syd]
I ride around in your car
I put my weed in your blunt
I am the sky to your star
I am the end of your month
You are the start of my day
You brought the smile from my face
I see the world from your eyes
You pulled a thorn from my side

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad & Syd]
I know you love me
It's rare, I know you love me
But, yeah, I know you love me
It's rare, I know you love me

[Verse 2: Isaiah Rashad & Syd]
You give me all that you got
You make it stretch it and flip
I fell in love with your thoughts
I learned it's more than your hips
You know I'm caught in my vibe
But I still give you my rib
You hear them callin' my name
But know it's hard for me here
I left a home with my son
I chose the world in the end
I say you know I be back
You try your best to pretend
I say you all that I want
And when I make it, it's real
I hear 'em callin' my name
It's gettin' hard for me here

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad & Syd tha Kyd]
To know you love me
It's rare to know you love me
But yeah I know you love me
It's rare I know you love me

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
And these thoughts are nothin' but your curses
And starin' at your mama, Heaven wasn't falling in here
So holla you heard I'm usin' narcotics
I don't wanna be here if I don't gotta
My weed habit so close to snortin' powder
Got a few gripes but it's only about a dollar bill so holla
Unless you're usin' narcotics
See I don't wanna be here if I don't gotta
My weed habit so close to snortin' powder
Got a few bitches but it's only bout a dollar
Feel so hollow unless you're usin' narcotics
See I don't wanna

[Outro: Dave Free]
Tell me, man you talkin' bout this, you talkin' bout that. Talkin' about shit you ain't got nothin' to talk about, find a motherfuckin' topic, God damn just find the topic bro. Seriously God damn, complicated ass young motherfuckers
