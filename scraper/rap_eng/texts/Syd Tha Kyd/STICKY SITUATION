[Verse 1]
I don't wanna fuss and fight
Sick of arguin' and all the lies
To tell you the truth, you got me thinkin' twice
Thought I got it right
I ain't really trippin' babe
You weren't the one I wanted anyway
I only pursued you for the booty, babe
Now you glued to me

[Chorus]
Stuck up in a sticky situation
A really iffy situation
Can't you tell, caramel, you're losing your flavor
And sugar, honey, I ain't got the patience
Stuck up in a sticky situation
A really iffy situation
Can't you tell, caramel, you're losing your flavor
Sugar, honey, I ain't got the patience

[Verse 2]
Loving you is bittersweet
Hate to admit it, you got the best of me
Damned if I let you get the rest of me
Whatever's left of me, oh
You should know we cast a vote
And all of the homies said you gotta go
All of the rest is outta my control
Don't get too comfortable

[Chorus]
Stuck up in a sticky situation
A really iffy situation
Can't you tell, caramel, you're losing your flavor
Sugar, honey, I ain't got the patience
Stuck up in a sticky situation
A really iffy situation
Can't you tell, caramel, you're losing your flavor
Sugar, honey, I ain't got the patience

[Outro]
It's like candy (candy, candy)
It's like candy (candy, candy)
It's like candy (uhh, huh)
Loving you is like candy (ohh, oh)
(It's like candy)
