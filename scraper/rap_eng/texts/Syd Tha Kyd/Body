[Verse 1]
Drink in your glass
You drinking it fast
I'm watching you dance
You’re watching my hands
Throw it back babe
Give it to me don't hold back babe
If your friends could see you right now
No lying girl I bet they'd wanna be you right now
Your body's takin over you
Your body's takin over you

[Chorus]
Baby we can take it slow, say my name
Don't let go, I can hear your body when I
Pull your hair, what’s my name
Girl I swear, I can hear your body babe

[Verse 2]
The bed is your stage
Take it away
Put on a show
Put on a play
Don't ask babe
You know I'm your number one fan babe
So
Get those cameras rollin right now
I’m directing and I really wanna see you act out
Let your body take over you
Your body's takin over you

[Chorus]
Baby we can take it slow, say my name
Don't let go, I can hear your body when I
Pull your hair, what’s my name
Girl I swear, I can hear your body babe
Girl I swear, I can hear your body babe
