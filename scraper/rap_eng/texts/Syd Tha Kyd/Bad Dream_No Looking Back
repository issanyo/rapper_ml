Part 1: Bad Dream

[Verse 1]
Deeper than still waters
Explorin' your peaks and your hills
You be fiendin' the thrills
'Cause you're a freak on the low
Now go as deep as can go, as deep as can go
You let me know that it's real
And you get mad on the phone
I be hatin' the tone, there's just a lot going on
I think you know that I'm missing you still
Though maybe you don't
Don't let me get you alone

[Chorus]
I can break you off and hold it down
Give you all the things your body's asking for
You can get me off, you put it down
You ain't gotta' lie, I know you nasty
Said you ain't gotta' lie, I know you nasty
Had you screamin' like a bad dream

Part 2: No Looking Back

[Chorus]
We only kiss when we fuckin'
So, we don't get too attached
'Cause if this turns into something
You know there's no looking back
No looking back, nah baby
No looking back, nah baby

[Verse 1]
Pull up on you like, "What it do?"
I crack a brew, you turn on a movie
Nothing to do but lay under you
Roll something, play a little music
I take my time
If it go down, it go 'til the morning
If I go down, you won't let me go
You gon' love me girl before you know it
We don't want that, no we don't
We won't commit, no we won't
Just call me when you get done
Call me when you get home

[Chorus]
We only kiss when we fuckin'
So, we don't get too attached
'Cause if this turns into something
You know there's no looking back
No looking back, nah baby
No looking back, nah baby
We only kiss when we fuckin'
So, we don't get too attached
'Cause if this turns into something
You know there's no looking back
No looking back, nah baby
No looking back, nah baby

[Verse 2]
Hit me up around eight or nine
Wanna come over, let's watch a movie
I'm on my way, you tell me to wait
Say your place is a mess
Doesn't matter to me
Don't waste your time
Be there in ten, better buzz me in
We say we don't want no love in this
But when we're intimate you don't resist
We might get lit in the moment
But I'm the shit and you know it
Just call me when you get done
Call me when you get home

[Chorus]
We only kiss when we fuckin'
So, we don't get too attached
'Cause if this turns into something
You know there's no looking back
No looking back, nah baby
No looking back, nah baby
We only kiss when we fuckin'
So, we don't get too attached
'Cause if this turns into something
You know there's no looking back
No looking back, nah baby
No looking back, nah baby
