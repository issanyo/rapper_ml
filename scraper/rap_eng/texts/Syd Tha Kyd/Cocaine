[Verse 1: Syd tha Kyd]
Hey Baby. Where you going?
You look good to me
You look good to be
Walking by yourself
Maybe I can help

[Hook 1: Syd tha Kyd]
I wanna, I wanna
Do you wanna do some cocaine?
I wanna, I wanna
Do you wanna do some cocaine?

[Hook 2: Syd tha Kyd]
Baby just ignore
The consequence
You look like you can use a little confidence
So follow me, just let it be your paradise
And now that you know what this feelings like
You know you can have it for the rest of your life
Just follow me, just follow me

[Verse 2: Left Brain]
She high as fuck up in my truck
Shocked up looking for a bitch to fuck
I'm high on coke, she high on coke
Coast to coast baby float my boat
Got coke to sniff and weed to roast
And no need to boast, let's snort

[Bridge: Syd tha Kyd]
2 in the back, one in the front
Do you wanna ride in my car?

[Break: Syd Tha Kyd]
Ayee
Don't trip
Just try it once
Don't worry (I wanna I wanna)
Just follow me (I wanna I wanna)

[Hook 2]
