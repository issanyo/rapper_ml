[Chorus - Tay Walker]
Keep on runnin'
Don't say its over, cause it's never over
Keep on runnin'
If you try to open your eyes and free your mind then you can
Keep on runnin' (hold on)
Runnin' (hold on)
Keep on runnin' (hold on)
Runnin' (hold on)
Keep on runnin'

[Verse]
I'm running from, unhappiness
No place to go, but towards the end
Cause I'm not impressed with the messages sent by those claiming they know me
So I just focus on what I control, my breathing
Running til I reach my goal, I see it
Way far in the distance
I know I can get it if I try
No matter what i gotta

[Chorus]
Keep on runnin'
Don't say its over, cause it's never over
Keep on runnin'
If you try to open your eyes and free your mind then you can
Keep on runnin' (hold on)
Runnin' (hold on)
Keep on runnin' (hold on)
Runnin' (hold on)
Keep on runnin'

[Coda]

Run run run
Run run run
Run run run
Run run run
Run run run
Run run run
