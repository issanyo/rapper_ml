[Verse 1]
Come through...
I feel like we're growing apart and I don't know what to do right now
Let's light one and talk it out
I know I fucked up and it's very difficult to express
How I feel through text, but that's all I can do right now
Remember when I told you that I loved you
But we couldn't be together cause I loved another
And you stood right there, looked me in my eye
And said "what you want me to do right now"
I know not your main chick but I'm right here
Until you tell me to go then I'll disappear
But if I leave, I ain't coming back wanna make that clear...

[Verse 2]
We know that both of our pasts ain't perfect
All this back and forth shit between me you and her, I know you don't deserve it
I mean I should just man up and let you leave now before your heart gets deserted...
Look I couldn't speak about it, so I wrote about it
First line, paragraph one, what do you expect me to do?
I'm in love with two women at the same time
Tryna smooth it all out but it's difficult
I just wanna see you happy, either with or without me
Wanna see you grow and one day start a family, either with out without me
Damn a nigga torn
