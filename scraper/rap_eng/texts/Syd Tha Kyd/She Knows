Perfect daughter
Had everything you ever wanted
In you
Planned with false hopes
Made your insecurities showed
It wasn't but you say
Made no difference
I'm hoping that some day
And with this change

She knows
I really hope that she knows
What she could be
She knows
I really hope that she knows
Is out to be

She's like the perfect daughter
She's never had anything given
Weren't careful
Now you have a son to hold

It wasn't but you say
Made no difference
I'm hoping that some day
And with this change

She knows
I really hope that she knows
What she could be
She knows
I really hope that she knows
Is out to be
