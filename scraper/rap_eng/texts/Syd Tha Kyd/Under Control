[Verse 1]
I woke up impatient and anxious
Chasin’ dreams in my sleep
Got me feeling like I made it
Then I wake up and see
Frustration tracing for payment
Thankfully they know me
Can’t get enough of the paper (Get enough of the paper)

[Pre-Hook]
I know you love it, babe, ‘cause I’m a risk
But if you put it on, Imma win
And if you give it to me, I won’t forget
When I'm a legend, baby, and we’re all rich

[Hook]
I need you to know
It’s under control, I got it
And as it unfolds, I got you, I promise
I promise I’m on it

[Verse 2]
I can’t help but feel like I'm wastin’ precious time in my life
Worrying about my behaviors, sometimes I think I’m too nice
I know I’m destined for greatness, fuck a critic’s advice
They hatin’ ‘cause I’m a player (they hatin’ ‘cause I’m a player)

[Pre-Hook]
I know you love it, babe, ‘cause I’m a risk
But if you put it on, Imma win (Imma)
And if you give it time, I won’t forget (I won’t forget)
When I'm a legend, baby, and we’re all rich

[Hook]
I need you to know
It’s under control, I got it (I got it)
And as it unfolds, I got you I promise
I promise I’m on it

[Bridge]
When it’s all said and done
Send my love on, oh
You know I’m tellin’ you the truth
When I say I’ll take care of you
Yeah, yeah

[Interlude]
You know, it get rough sometime
[?]

[Hook]
But look, I need you to know (it can only get better from here)
It’s under control, I got it (I got it, babe)
And as it unfolds, I got you, I promise
I promise I’m on it
I need you to know
It’s under control, I got it
And as it unfolds, I got you, I promise
I promise I’m on it
