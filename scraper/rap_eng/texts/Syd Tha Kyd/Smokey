I remember
I only had one shoes to go to school
Now I got 5 shoes to do the moves
Gotta pay your dues
Cuz it alwasy comes right back around like your dancing in a hula hoop
Oh my god I’ve been stressing
So much time I’ve invested
Will I make it no telling
Lifes to hot to be heaven
But ain’t growth without lessons
Black don’t crack under pressure
(Ain’t no pressure baby)
So I’ma be good like the hook said
(yeah)
And I don’t care how long it took me
Feeling like church right now on a Sunday
Sing to me like

Everything gon be alright
I said everything go be alright
Everything gon be alright
Everything gon be alright
Ohhhhh
Oooooo

Everything gon
Bay baby
