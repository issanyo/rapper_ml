Partners In Crime - the Internet

We can conquer the world
Just you and me no one else
Tell me if thats cool
What chu wanna do
Ahh Ohhh

Guns drawn in an all black car
Bustin at all the lames
Who got something to say about us
We can rob this world blind
And maybe next time
They'll think twice
Before they try fuckin with us

Just imagine what it be like be like
If you and me ruled everything
Would it be (Cool)
Or Would it be cool

Can you imagine what it be like be like
If you and me ruled everything
Would it be (Cool)
Or Would it be cool

If we would conquer the world
Would you be down to roll with me
Like partners in crime
Til the end of time

Guns drawn in an all black car
Bustin at all the lames
Who got something to say about us
We can rob this world blind
And maybe next time
They'll think twice
Before they try fuckin with us

Just imagine what it be like be like
If you and me ruled everything
Would it be (Cool)
Or would it be cool

Can you imagine what it be like be like
If you and me ruled everything
Would it be (Cool)
Or Would it be cool
