[Verse 1]
This is for my little one at Toledo State
Decide to write a verse cause I don't know how to communicate
I hope you're doing good at school and keeping up your grades
You got a boyfriend yet?
What's his name and I'll run this fade
No, I'm just kidding
We don't speak often and that kinda hurts
Writin' this verse I'm tryna keep the tears up off my shirt
I know you growin' up fast now and for what it's worth
I watch you from a distance, hella proud and crack a smirk
I know mom is shinin' hard, even in the winter
You the only one who share the same when we say we miss her
I think of what happened wish I could make some changes
I wish our differences didn't turn us to distant strangers
I'm hopin' and prayin' time brings its full circle
We both learn life ain't fair and has its own curfew
We share the same blood, so ain't no reason for this
Wish we were closer but maybe it ain't the season for this
And that's alright

[Hook: Syd]
You're on my mind
I won't stop the tide
Its been a while
Hope you come around
