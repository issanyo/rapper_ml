[Verse 1]
There's another new love
I know you tryna do right
But maybe we should stay cooped up
Like we don't know what moonlight is
Lately I've been going crazy
Begging you to stay
'Cause I just want you safe
Anger, ominous behavior
Got you feeling anxious all the time

[Chorus]
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
Baby just stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
You know it ain't safe outside
You should just stay tonight
Why don't you stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Baby just stay tonight

[Verse 2]
You've been feeling kinda juiced up
Seeing things in a new light
I know you've been through stuff, but
I wonder if you're too righteous
'Cause lately people going crazy
I think you should stay
'Cause I just want you safe
Baby, I know that you're angry
Feeling like your fate is on the line

[Chorus]
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
Baby just stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
You know it ain't safe outside
You should just stay tonight
Why don't you stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Baby just stay tonight
Talk to â€˜em Pat

[Bridge]
I just (I just)
Think you should (you should)
Stay the night (stay the night)
I just (I just)
Think you should (you should)
Stay the night (stay the night)
You should kick it babe

[Chorus]
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
Baby just stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Why don't you stay the night
You know it ain't safe outside
You should just stay tonight
Why don't you stay the night
Maybe you should stay the night
Baby just stay tonight
