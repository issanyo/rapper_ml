[Verse 1]
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
What's it sayin'?

[Chorus]
Star shine so bright
Hear it in your heart
They're up so high
Hear it in your heart
I wanna fly
Check your voicemail
Hear your heart go

[Post-Chorus]
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll
Hear your heart go

[Verse 2]
As you're coming down
Where'd your heart go?

[Chorus]
Star shine so bright
It's all in your heart
They're up so high
It's all in your heart
I wanna fly
Look no further
Let your heart flow

[Post-Chorus]
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll
Let your heart flow
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll (all night), roll (all night), roll (all night)
Let your heart flow

[Outro]
All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night
