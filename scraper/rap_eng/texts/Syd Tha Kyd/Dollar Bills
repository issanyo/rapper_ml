[Verse 1]
Alright I pull up the freshest
But what's new? I walk in, no guest list
The chandelier matches my necklace
Don't worry about it
Don't know about you, but I'm feeling like the man
And she dancing like she knows I am
Now she actin' like she don't know them
So I'm flashing all this cash on her
Watching her ass, I know you can go faster, girl

[Chorus]
Shake it for these dollar bills
You know I'm hella faded, baby, cop a feel
Want you to turn me on, this your favorite song
Don't stop until you get enough, babe, you get enough, babe
So won't you shake it for these dollar bills?
Say, say, shake it for these dollar bills
(Don't stop until you get enough)
Uh huh, now would you shake it for these dollar bills? Uh
Say, say shake it for these dollar bills, uh huh, ayy, ayy
(Don't stop until you get enough, babe)

[Verse 2]
Alright, I'm on to the next chick (yuh)
But what's new? I've always been reckless
Now we posted up by the exit (ayy)
Girl what it do?
I don't know 'bout you
But you looking like the one (like the one)
And you staring like you know what's up
Be careful, girl, don't press your luck
Now she telling me I'm drunk
If you ain't tryna fuck
Then at least show me something, girl

[Chorus]
Shake it for these dollar bills
You know I'm hella faded, baby, cop a feel
Want you to turn me on, this your favorite song
Don't stop until you get enough, babe, you get enough, babe
So won't you shake it for these dollar bills?
Say, say, shake it for these dollar bills
(Don't stop until you get enough)
Uh huh, now would you shake it for these dollar bills? Uh
Say, say shake it for these dollar bills, uh huh, ayy, ayy
(Don't stop until you get enough, babe)

[Bridge: Steve Lacy]
Baby don't get no emotions involved, just shake your ass on me
You know I'll toss you couple bills, girl I got it
Hundreds in my pocket
Talking 'bout you love me
I don't know you, girl, so stop it
My shawty at the crib 'cause she didn't wanna come
She always with me when I'm turning up and having fun
Now I'm here alone, just enjoying you
For the moment, so just go 'head and do what you do

[Chorus]
Shake it for these dollar bills
You know I'm hella faded, baby, cop a feel
Want you to turn me on, this your favorite song
Don't stop until you get enough, babe, you get enough, babe
So won't you shake it for these dollar bills?
Say, say, shake it for these dollar bills
(Don't stop until you get enough)
Uh huh, now would you shake it for these dollar bills? Uh
Say, say shake it for these dollar bills, uh huh, ayy, ayy
(Don't stop until you get enough, babe)

[Outro]
Shake it for these dollar bills
Get naked for some bigger faces
Do something strange for a little change
Just be honest with me
Ha
