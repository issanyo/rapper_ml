[Verse 1]
I could write a hundred songs for you
Sing 'em all night long to you
Even break the law for you
Then tell the judge to blame it all on me
Still it wouldn't be enough, baby
Got me questioning your love lately
Is it me or is it you?
Tell me what I gotta do

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been moving mountains for you
I've been moving mountains for you
Working my fingers to the bone
Working my fingers to the bone
And what I got to show for it?
Tell me, what I got to show for it?
I've been moving mountains for you

[Verse 2]
Used to take you on the road with me
Backstage, all of the shows with me
Hotel, top floor with me
Seashell, seashore with me
Don't you know I do it all for you?
Catch a case, I take the fall for you
You don't appreciate a thing, babe
Got me out here lookin' crazy

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been moving mountains for you
I've been moving mountains for you
Working my fingers to the bone
Working my fingers to the bone
And what I got to show for it?
Tell me, what I got to show for it?
I've been moving mountains for you

[Outro]
What if I can't be your world?
While it's lost up in the sky
Baby you know I been workin'
While I was on the moon
Got some diamonds for you, girl
Bring them home for you to try
Gave me nothing in return
Guess it's me, myself and I
