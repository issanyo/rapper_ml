[Intro]
Just so Pittsburgh, man

[Chorus 1]
So how's it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel?
Now it's real
So can you tell me how you feel?
Can you tell me how it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How's it feel? So can you tell me how's it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?

[Verse 1]
Said, "Baby, what you doing tonight?
We could watch the world get ruined tonight," living this life
Got you flexin', feelin' cooler than ice, let it melt
As we follow all the stupid advice, and I don't usually like
To be this honest witchu, I must have lost the picture
Gimme a box of swishers, room full of obnoxious bitches (Got you)
Why you lyin' to me? Just grab your ladies
That Mercedes all kinds of roomy, and when the time's are gloomy
Hit me up, I can make you feel like the perfect girl you wish you was
Givin' you that feeling like when Christmas come
I just take all of my problems, throw 'em in a blunt
Light 'em up and watch 'em float away, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch 'em float
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
Can you dream?
Can you tell me how's it feel?

[Chorus 2]
How's it feel? How's it feel?
How's it feel? Can you tell me how
It feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me? (How's it feel?)
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me? (How's it feel?)
How's it feel? How's it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel, how's it feel?
How's it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How's it feel? Yes
How's it feel?

[Verse 2]
Okay, said
I'm back on these rap songs, feeling they're never gonna last long
Got a shortcut, baby? I'll pass on it, my dick, throw your ass on it (Blaow)
Pass the time, ask for my alibi, tryna tell you I need that
(I need that) Just relax (Just relax)
Put that money in my motherfucking hand, drinking in the pool, goddamn
Ain't part of the plan, like a car in a van, I'm rollin', I'm feelin' good, I'm golden
My man, let me just do my dance
'Cause, motherfucker, this my jam, said this my jam, this my jam
How many times you 'bout to let them opportunities pass you by?
I used to be a pretty passive guy, since before I was a goddamn mastermind
In that castle of mine, I came up in half the time as these lame fucks
You can't rush that greatness, that mansion where my maid lives

[Pre-Chorus]
Like wow, watch 'em float
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
Can you dream?
Can you tell me how's it feel?

[Chorus 2]
How's it feel? How's it feel?
How's it feel? Can you tell me how
It feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me? (How's it feel?)
How it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me? (How's it feel?)
How's it feel? How's it feel?
Can you tell me how it feel, how's it feel?
How's it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How's it feel?
How's it feel? Ha

[Post-Chorus]
How's it feel?
How's it feel?
How's it feel?
How's it feel?
Okay, now tell me how's it feel?
How's it feel? Can you tell me how it feel?
How's it feel? (Please)
How's it feel to come and hang around a motherfucker like me?
How's it feel?
How's it feel? Ha

"l know, man. Cops can kiss my ass."
"All they are is assholes"
"l know, man, but what's the matter with them? They mad 'cause we get more pussy than they do?"
