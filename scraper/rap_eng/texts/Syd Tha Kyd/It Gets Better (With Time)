[Verse 1]
Is something wrong?
'Cause you seem mighty low
Tell me what's going on
Probably been there before
Sit up and fix your face
You see me, I'm okay
We ain't got time today
Throw on your darker shades and
Smile for the camera
I want you to know

[Chorus]
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time

[Verse 2]
Keep it up
I see you holding on
But it was easy, no?
Now you feel all alone
Quit crying, ease your pain
Gon' be here either way
Nowhere to place the blame
So put your make up on and
Smile in the mirror
I want you to know

[Chorus]
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time

[Verse 3: Big Rube]
Your inner strength is the reason you haven't said a word
But your countenance reveals the bad day that you've endured
It's probably not the first and not the last to be assured
The past is fleeting the future
A promise present keeping us moving forward
With hope we seek true happiness
Throughout our lives with
Trials we face bring pain and sorrow, but resistance, sir, is strength
The easy path rarely leads to what our heart truly desires
In this life we must face many a worthy challenge for the outcome to satisfy us
To win inspite of struggle implies much greater magnification
To ones honor which I value more than instant-gratification
So believe me when I say that time can heal most any wound
And ease most pain, yet the scars remain until the day we lay entombed
So please know nothing in this moment is the same as a moment ago
Each one that pass is a treasure lost.......

[Chorus]
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
That it gets better with time
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)
(I just hope you know that, that it gets)

[Outro: Patrick Paige II]
Tommorrow's not in your hands
That's why I pray to the man
And I think it's arrogant to make plans in advance
One day at a time
I burn the sage for all the negative, pay it no mind
I'm at ease with the struggles, they're better with time
Need not I remind
Tomorrow's not in your hands, neither is control
Nigga, reap what you sow and pay it in full
Think before you burn the bridge, paying the toll
Just play your role
So much pressure in the world I started my gnashing teeth
Hit the gas so hard I blew a gasket and leaked
Drain me for what I got like a nasty leech
You'll find hard learned lessons just asking our teach'
Life is what you make it, take it how you gon' take it
My ground is solid and no earthquake could not shake it
Ain't waiting on nothing, not even no reparations
Heavily meditating, but it gets better with time
And I'm sober now, no alcohol to hide behind
I grow older and grow bolder
I move mountains and move boulders
I cross borders, don't take orders
And thank God, that's important
