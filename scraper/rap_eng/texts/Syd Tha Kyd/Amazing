{Chorus}
I just don't like, like
When they press up on you
Baby cause I just know I'm
Know I'm the best one for you
You think I'm crazy I know
Oh yea
But you're just amazing, amazing, amazing

{Verse 1}
Girl I hope this isn't wrong
But every time I see you I try to talk to you oh babe
Nah babe hold up
Praying please don't let her show these niggas no love
Cause I think I'm the better choice (choice)
You should recognize (nize)
Catching in my eyes
Look deep in them baby
I truly enjoy spending time with you
Don't know what I can do to make you see that I'm the one for you
Girl them niggas is the same running game, I'm the one for you
If you're tired of the rain, baby I'll bring on the sun for you
Take you to Spain or the Caymans, know the Bahamas is you're favorite
I'm waiting [?]
Till then I'm hoping I can control myself
Cause

{Chorus}
I just don't like, like
When they press up on you
Baby cause I just know I'm
Know I'm the best one for you
You think I'm crazy I know
Oh yea
But you're just amazing, amazing, amazing

{Bridge}
I'm just trying to be your lover
I'm just trying to be your lover

{Verse 2}
Girl you got me going crazy
You really changed me
Never was the jealous type I guess you made me
Let him try again then he gone have to fade me
If I punch him in his nose then you will probably hate me
But this has been really getting to me lately
I'm not trying to cause drama
I'm just impatient
Waiting for you to say okay, maybe we can try something
Don't keep me waiting too long
Girl let's try something
Cause if not I have to move on and that ain't what I want girl
Want you to see a life with me, living in a dream
Baby gone get comfortable, comfortable oh babe
Tell them other niggas no way
Cause

{Chorus}
I just don't like, like
When they press up on you
Baby cause I just know I'm
Know I'm the best one for you
You think I'm crazy I know
Oh yea
But you're just amazing, amazing, amazing

{Bridge}
I'm just trying to be your lover
I'm just trying to be your lover
