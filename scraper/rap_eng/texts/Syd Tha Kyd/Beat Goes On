[Verse 1: Steve]
So restless
Just need time to think
So much pressure
If you want to be
My girlfriend
'Cause I'm on the road
I don't wanna hear you tell me you told me so

[Chorus]
If it was me who fell in love
With you, someone who won't be home
I feel so lonely just because
I want you all for my own
But if it don't work it's okay
Because I'll be here for you all day, baby
Ooh
But the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on

[Verse 2: Matt]
She's so alone
Scratch forward
I just want us to be alright
I hope she don't let go
And then I cause her to think twice, whoa

[Chorus]
If it was me who fell in love
Would you still want me, won't be home
I feel so lonely just because
I want you all for my own
But if it don't work it's okay
Because I'll be here for you all day, baby
But the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on
The beat goes on, the beat goes on

[Outro]
The beat goes, the beat goes, the beat goes on
The beat goes, the beat goes, the beat goes on
The beat goes, the beat goes, the beat goes on
The beat goes, the beat goes, the beat goes on
Yeah the beat goes on and on
Yeah the beat goes on and on
Yeah the beat goes on and on
Yeah the beat goes on and on
