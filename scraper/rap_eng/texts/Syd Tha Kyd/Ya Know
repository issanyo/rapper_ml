[Verse 1]
She's all alone with a bottle of patron
I see you and ask you where you're from
But she tells me just to stop right there
Cause I'm not gone get no ass, so I'm on my way
But a few more drinks and she returns
Don't know what she's saying, her speech is slurred
So I grabbed her waist

[Hook]
And I look you in your eyes
Ya know that I wanna baby
Ya know that I wanna baby
Dance with you, dance with you
Ya know that I wanna baby
Ya know that I wanna baby
Dance with you, just you, only you

[Verse 2]
You're safe with me so don't be scared (Just come this way)
The bedroom, let's go upstairs (Just come this way)
United we can form as one
I just wanna feel ya touch, then I'm on my way
But I think I'm starting to like this girl
Or maybe I'm just twisted, so I'll ask her to stay

[Hook]
Ya know that I wanna baby
Ya know that I wanna baby
Dance with you, dance with you
Ya know that I wanna baby
Ya know that I wanna baby
Dance with you, just you, only you

[Outro]
Do you wanna have some fun
Do you wanna have some fun
Do you wanna have some fun
Do you wanna have some fun
