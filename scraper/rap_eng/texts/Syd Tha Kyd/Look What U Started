[Verse 1]
(Why?)
Know you got it coming, babe
You took this shit from zero to a hundred, babe
I hope you finally get it on your judgment day
'Cause you're gonna pay babe, you're gonna pay babe

[Verse 2]
Given you enough of me (nuff of that, nuff of that)
But need you when you said you were in love with me
(loved you back, loved you back)
I heard that you've been tryna get in touch with me
What you got to say babe? you got to say babe?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you should ask yourself (hey)
Was- was it worth it?
Before you go and ask for help (hey)
Do you deserve it?

[Chorus]
Girl you know what you did
Look what you started
What's going through your head?
Are you sorry?
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)

[Verse 3]
Don't know what you're going through
You blame it on your problems but it's no excuse
(It's no excuse)
You can't keep playing innocent, I know the truth
I know that you're crazy, I know all your crazy (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 4]
Falling out of love with you  (nuff of that, nuff of that)
Wasn't easy but I finally gotten over you  (nuff of that, nuff of that)
More power to the one that gets a hold of you
'Cause I ain't gonna take it, ain't gonna take it

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you should ask yourself (hey)
Was- was it worth it?
Before you go and ask for help (hey)
Do you deserve it?

[Chorus]
Girl you know what you did
Look what you started
What's going through your head?
Are you sorry?
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)

[Chorus]
Girl you know what you did (did)
Look what you started
What's going through your head? (your head)
Are you sorry?
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)
There's nothing left to say (say, say, say, say)

[Outro]
Look
That's just the way that I felt (Just the way I felt)
Told you this time it's for real
So say goodbye (goodbye)
To you and I
Meanwhile I'll try to forget (I'll try baby)
The way you treated me then, no
It wasn't right (wasn't right) but you'll pay the price
Bitch
Oh babe, why
