[Intro]
Vegetables, Vegetables

[Verse 1: Jesse Boykins III]
We all know carrots, carrots
They build your eye sight
She can buy her own things on her own night
So make sure when you step up, step up
Know you gotta stay up, stay up
Cause only made men ever have the right
To comfort when she made men fight and fight and fight
She said her prayers
Mmmm-mmmm, Mmmm-mmmm
Mmmm-mmmm, Mmmm-mmmm

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
I was first in my class
I made her laugh
I got her high
At least I tried
I was first in the state
I could relate
I got a while
At least I thought
She said eat your vegetables
She said eat your vegetables
She said eat your vegetables
Then maybe one day you can have some of me

[Verse 2: Willow Smith + Syd tha Kyd]
Boy meets girl stuck in the same boat
So young world, two them shaking through though
Girl meets guy, her eyes never give in
Tell 'em ask why, she doesn't wanna share
She said you must become what you run from
You must dig deep together with me
Not too far from gold
Had a long dirt road
And you'll find the stone
It's all he'll ever need and more

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
I was first in my class
I made her laugh
I got her high
At least I tried
I was first in the state
I could relate
I got a while
At least I thought
She said eat your vegetables
She said eat your vegetables
She said eat your vegetables
Then maybe one day you can have some of me

[Bridge: Jesse Boykins III]
We never want nothin'
We never want nothin'
We never ask why
We never ask why
Still you run from me
Still you run from me
Now I know why
Now I know why
Now I know it's the green you after
Now I know it's the green you after
Now I know, now I know
Now I know it's the green you after

[Bridge: Jesse Boykins III]
We never want nothin'
We never want nothin'
We never ask why
We never ask why
Still you run from me
Still you run from me
Now I know why
Now I know why
Now I know it's the green you after
Now I know it's the green you after
Now I know, now I know
Now I know it's the green you after

[Bridge: Jesse Boykins III]
We never want nothin'
We never want nothin'
We never ask why
We never ask why
Still you run from me
Still you run from me
Now I know why
Now I know why
Now I know it's the green you after
Now I know it's the green you after
Now I know, now I know
Now I know it's the green you after

[Outro]
Gotta eat your vegtables
Gotta eat your vegtables
Yeah-yeah, oh-oh
