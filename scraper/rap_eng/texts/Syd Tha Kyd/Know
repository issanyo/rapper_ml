[Verse 1]
Baby don't, let me go babe
Baby don't, don't say no babe
Can't nobody know, nobody, no
Keep it between us, can't let 'em see us
It’ll be our secret, don’t wanna get caught creeping
Is it really cheating, who says we're cheating

[Chorus]
Don't let nobody know
Let’s keep it on the low
And as long as he don't
Long as she don't
We’ll lay back and play the game
And as long as he don't
Long as she don't
Ain't no need to play it safe

[Verse 2]
Here we are, all alone babe
If we had a little more time, I’d take it slow babe
You can stay 'til the morning, when we wake up jump on it
It’s the way that you flaunt it, lets me know that you want it, and I
Can’t, say, no

[Chorus]
Don't let nobody know
Let’s keep it on the low
And as long as he don't
Long as she don't
We’ll lay back and play the game
And as long as he don't
Long as she don't
Ain't no need to play it safe

[Bridge]
Keep it secret baby they don't have to know (they don’t have to know girl)
No more pictures baby put away your phone (put away your phone girl)
Let em wonder what we do when we’re alone
Cause you know how I like it babe, let's do this in private baby
Keep it secret baby (let’s keep it on the low)
We don't need it baby (let’s keep it on the low)
Privacy is golden (let’s keep it on the low)
So don't get too excited babe
Don't tell them about it baby

[Chorus]
Don't let nobody know
Let’s keep it on the low
And as long as he don't
Long as she don't
We’ll lay back and play the game
And as long as he don't
Long as she don't
Ain't no need to play it safe

[Outro]
Keep it on the low
On the low, girl, keep it on the low
Keep it on the low
On the low, girl, keep it on the low
