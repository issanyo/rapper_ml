[Hook]
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the o's
Keep the o's, nigga keep the o's
Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
Keep the o's, (nigga) keep the o's
Know they know me by treat your nose

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Look, UFO, bow, land
Skrr landed on the ass and
Adidas leaf in the grassland
My finger got a yellow Pac-Man
Blow your purple, go in circles, so inertia
Go reverse it, no rehearsin', gold is perfect
Open curtain, flow inversion, golden person
Yeah I'm nerdy, yeah I'm swerving
Yeah you heard me

[Hook]
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the o's
Keep the o's, nigga keep the o's
Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
Keep the o's, (nigga) keep the o's
Know they know me by treat your nose
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the o's
Keep the o's, nigga keep the o's
Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
Keep the o's, (nigga) keep the o's
Know they know me by treat your nose

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
My garden's full from breaking these hoes
A hand full of green and a couple of stones
Your lawnmower's foreign, you rent you a home
But nigga, how much of that shit do you own?
See me, I don't compromise, I know my accomplishments
Fuck your compliments, bitch I got confidence
I don't need your approval, my nigga you suck
I do not have to adjust
You stuck, I'm talking
So shut the fuck up
Speedin' and gleamin' and stuntin' so Evel Knievel
You convene with that circle of demons you’re hoping them niggas’ll see it
Results may vary
Chain not too heavy
I'll rather pedal smooth on my bike than crash in that Bugatti
Back to the garden
Niggas gon' do you dirty
Y'all already saw it
Killing your flowers
This thing’s impossible
It's the new slave apocalypse
Isn’t that obvious
All you stupid niggas got the whips

[Hook]
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the o's
Keep the o's
Keep the o's
Keep the o's
You gotta keep the o's
Keep the o's
Keep the o's
Keep the o's
You gotta keep the o's

[Bridge]
Keep da o's
You gotta keep the o's (keep the o's)
Cause you never know when it's over
You want the doors that go up
You want the girls with the big butts
You want the diamonds, you want the stones
You gotta stunt on these niggas
Stunt on these niggas one time

Find your wings
Find your wings
Find your wings
And fly
Cause you'll find your wings
You'll find your wings
Learn how to fly (learn)
Let me tell you what I want you to do
What I want you to do
You'll find your wings
You'll find your wings
Learn how to fly
(Learn)

Keep the o's

[Outro]
I'm rapping about diamonds, and cars, and money now
What the fuck has gotten into me, man
