[Verse 1]
She's a killa
Catch her if you can, she's on her way
Residin' up in New York City, Park Avenue, you know she paid (yah, yah)
Untouchable, shawty on fire
Life is a beach and she dive
Straight in the bottle, Ciroc Amaretto
You know that she drownin' alive
Sippin' and chillin' with women who don't even know me
You're catchin my vibe
Steady just chasin this paper
But rather it be you that's here by my side (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just hopin' I can do it right
Never know what's wrong because I do it right
Better ask about me girl
I do you right, I do you right

[Chorus]
This girl is cold, that wrist is froze
Probably dripped in gold
But this you know
She do her thang, 'cause she's a pro
I might as well admit that I'm addicted on the low
This girl is suicide
You got me, you got me suicide
This girl has got me thinkin' suicide
You got me, you got me suicide
Girl, you suicide

[Verse 2]
Shawty so bad, in trouble
Now I'm on parole (locked in love, locked in love)
And I can't get mad
That she's famous and she's on the road (yah, yah)
Yeah she bossed up in that ghost
When she floss it's like she don't go
She swipe that black card for her backyard
Now her backyard is on vogue
Never told a lie, nigga, I don't joke
If I would've lied, baby, I'd be broke
And you'll never get another nigga better
'Cause I'm cold like weather like when it snows (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just hopin' I can do it right
Never know what's wrong because I do it right
Better ask about me girl
I do you right, I do you right (aye)

[Chorus]
This girl is cold, that wrist is froze
Probably dripped in gold
But this you know
She do her thang, 'cause she's a pro
I might as well admit that I'm addicted on the low
This girl is suicide
You got me, you got me suicide
This girl has got me thinkin' suicide
You got me, you got me suicide
Girl, you suicide

[Outro]
Suicide, suicide
Suicide, suicide
Suicide, suicide
Suicide, suicide
Suicide, suicide
