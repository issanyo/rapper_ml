[Verse 1]
I've been on the road, been doin' shows
Back to back all up the coast, this how it goes
I'll call you when I can, just left Japan with my nigga
Shit is grand, yeah, this shit is grand
But we've been on the road, shout out to Flow
That's my nigga, he's the GOAT, yeah, yeah he's the GOAT
Still she sleepin' in a van, to meet the fans
Always somethin' to promote, but, hey, this was the goal
We've been on the road
Like where the fuck is home?
Bag full of dirty clothes
Little shit that they don't know

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 2]
I think they need another classic
Ain't no need to get dramatic though
Catch me plottin' up with Matt
Ridin' through East Point Atlanta hoe
Doin' well, doin' damage (hey)
Future on panoramic mode
'Bout to change up the status quo
Your opinion doesn't matter, no, no, no

[Verse 3]
This ain't new, check the catalog
I've been giftin' niggas, call me Santa Claus
If he get to trippin', turn the cameras off
I can get you lifted, call me Adderall
But I ain't with the shits, but I'm kinda lit
Ain't no tellin' who I'm ridin' with
By my lover, but I'll fight a bitch
I'll fight a bitch

[Chorus]
Love it, love it, love it, love it
Love it, love it, love it, love it
Baby we've been on the road
Love it, love it, love it, love it
Been on the road
Love it, love it, love it, love it

[Verse 4]
Eligible bachelorette
Holdin' out for a centerfold
Oh so gentle with the flex
'Bout my presence, they offended though
I appreciate the press
But I don't vibe with all the pressure though
Couldn't answer, leave a message, ho
I ain't 'bout it, I ain't stressin' hoes

[Verse 5]
Thank the Lord for the lessons, dawg
I've been trippin' lately, it's a blessin', dawg
What I'm sippin' lately, it's expensive, dawg
Way I'm livin', I'ma be a legend, dawg
Kinda good lookin', kinda rich
I don't wear no designer shit
Ain't no tellin' what I'm ridin' in
But the west is what side it is on

[Chorus]
Love it, love it, love it, love it
Love it, love it, love it, love it
Baby we've been on the road
Love it, love it, love it, love it
Been on the road
Love it, love it, love it, love it
