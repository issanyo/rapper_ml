[Verse 1: Malia]
Don't even try to tell me nothin'
I can see baby you're bluffin'
Sayin' way to much of somethin'
Try to wash it away but I knew
I already saw it coming
In between all of the coughing
Somethin' told me not to trust it
'Cause I knew what you were really up to

[Chorus]
You can go and air it out
Baby I know your whereabouts
You hangin' out, leave me up to dry
Got me by a thread hangin on the line
Air it out
You can go and air it out
Wear it out
No more dealing with your dirty laundry

[Verse 1: Syd]
Lets face it
I'm cleanin' out the basement
What we had is fadin'
It's true
Nothin' 'bout this love is brand new
You keep on talkin' to me making me believe
That I'll do you right and give you what you need
I packed your bags for the laundromat
And once you leave, ain't no coming back

[Chorus]
You can go and air it out
Baby I know your whereabouts
You hangin' out, leave me up to dry
Got me by a thread hangin on the line
Air it out
You can go and air it out
Wear it out
No more dealing with your dirty laundry

[Bridge]
Oh
No
I don't really wonder
Oh
No
[?]
Don't make them dirty sheets
'Cause you ain't ever coming clean
So I don't want your company
Nah nah nah

[Chorus]
You can go and air it out
Baby I know your whereabouts
You hangin' out, leave me up to dry
Got me by a thread hangin on the line
Air it out
You can go and air it out
Wear it out
No more dealing with your dirty laundry

Air it out
Air it out (you can go and air it out)
Air it out
