[Intro: Hugh Augustine & Syd]
I need this night (Nights on replay)
(found right play)
Nights on replay (Nights on replay)
Need this night
Nights on replay
(Night on replay)

[Verse 1: Hugh Augustine]
This the night I wanna last (that I wanna last)
Forever
Turn your phone off, take a load off
I'm gonna get you so high
You ain't never wanna lay
(ohh)

[Verse 2: Hugh Augustine]
Banging in the kitchen like pots and pants
Going so deep, need oxygen
I know you got the real [?] per ten
Know a brother actin' like we ain't just friends
Lately, I have been wishin'
Babe I have been thinkin'
I know you for a reason
I love it when you coming
I hate it when you leaving
I know it's just like me to come and catch feelings (catch feelings)
I have been caught up in my feelings
Sometimes, I need a piece of that to unwind
Then I'll runnin' back one time
Yeah

[Hook: Syd]
Nights on replay, Nights on replay, Nights on replay
Rights on replay, Nights on replay, Nights on replay
Nights on replay, Nights all on replay
Lets night it all night on replay

[Verse 3: Hugh Augustine]
