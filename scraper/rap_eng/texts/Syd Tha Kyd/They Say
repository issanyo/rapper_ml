[Verse 1 - Syd tha Kyd]
They say that every day is a struggle and it takes time
But do they, do they have a clue?
How do I, do I tell the truth from a lie now?
They're trying to say hello, it's goodbye tomorrow
Just put a little weed in the bowl..and you'll be all right!
You'll be all right!

[Bridge - Syd tha Kyd]
Just think if things were perfect
Would it be worth it if even at all
So don't act like you can't take it
You were meant to be greatness
You can weather the storm

[Hook - Syd tha Kyd & Tay Walker]

I know how easy, it is to give up
But don't let people to hold you down!
And I know sometimes it'll amaze you (it'll amaze you)
Don't let it phase you
Just hold your ground!

They say, they say hmmm
They say, they say hmmm
They say, they say hmmm

[Verse 2 - Tay Walker]
Oh, oh!
Why do we judge those we don't know
There's no need to hide
You know what's inside!
What do we hate when there is love to spare
Why don't we understand
That
The only way to grow is with love!

[Bridge - Syd tha Kyd]
Just think if things were perfect
Would it be worth it if even at all
So don't act like you can't take it
You were meant to be greatless
You can weather the storm

[Hook - Syd tha Kyd & Tay Walker]
I know how easy, it is to give up
But don't let people to hold you down!
And I know sometimes it'll amaze you (it'll amaze you)
Don't let it fade you
Just hold your ground!
