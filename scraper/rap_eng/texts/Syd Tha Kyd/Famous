[Verse 1]
Baby let me tell ya
I can do it if you give me a chance
You got something special
I can tell just by the way you dance with me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The way you move
(The way move girl, the way you move girl, the way you move)
Girl you're lookin' like you practice in the mirror
If you knew
(If you knew girl, if you knew girl, if you knew)
You'd know the things that I could do for your career

[Chorus]
Girl you are
You're one in a million, babe
Wanna help you make it
Superstar
I don't want to manage you but I
I wanna make you famous
(Wanna make you famous)

[Verse 2]
Gettin' down to business
We can flip the script and change the play
It's your first audition
Hope you savor your first taste of fame, babe

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're so smooth
(you're so smooth girl, you're so smooth girl, you're so smooth)
I know you see it when you're lookin' in the mirror
If you knew
(If you knew girl, if you knew girl, if you knew)
If you knew the things that I could do for your career

[Chorus]
Girl you are
You're one in a million, babe
Wanna help you make it
Superstar
I don't want to manage you but I
I wanna make you famous
(Wanna make you famous)

[Chorus]
Girl you are
You're one in a million, babe
Wanna help you make it, yeah
Superstar
I don't want to manage you but I
I wanna make you famous
(Wanna make you famous)

[Bridge]
Tell you what I want
Tell you what you need
You could have it all if you just put your all in me
You can play Monroe, I'll be Kennedy
Lights, camera, action, baby
You're the main attraction, baby
Famous
All I wanna do is

[Chorus]
Girl you are
You're one in a million, babe
Wanna help you make it
Superstar
I don't want to manage you but I
I wanna make you famous
(Wanna make you famous)

[Chorus]
Girl you are
You're one in a million, babe
Wanna help you make it
Superstar
I don't want to manage you but I
I wanna make you famous
(Wanna make you famous)
