[Verse 1: Janelle Monáe and Syd the Kyd]
Lately when I look into your eyes
I see indefinite trouble
Darlin’ as much as I’d love to try
I can't help but feel so far from you
Yet I’m in the terminal
This probably looks so typical
I probably should be going home
But you make me want to stay
And I love your visual
So let’s just keep it digital
But baby can you break me off before I fly away oh

[Hook: Janelle Monáe and Syd the Kyd x2]
Gabby(let me tell you something)
Gabby (listen when I’m talkin’ to you)
Gabby (things I wish we could’ve done)
Gabby (are you listenin’ to me?)
Gabby (better pay attention ‘cause I)
Gabby (‘cause I wanted you to be the one) (the one)
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. This bitch talkin’ ‘bout she can’t even come now. Talkin’ ‘bout her niggas found out about us talking and like, she can’t meet up like

[Verse 2: Syd the Kyd]
Back seat, take it, seat belt, time to fasten it
Gabby’s waiting and it’s a trip to me
That I’m still in this terminal
And what I'm lookin’ for, it isn’t at the gate
So I told TSA my ticket’s fake, I’m on parole
So you should send me home before I make a mistake

[Hook: Janelle Monáe and Syd the Kyd]
Gabby (let me tell you something)
Gabby (listen when I’m talkin’ to you)
Gabby (things I wish we could’ve done)
Gabby (are you listenin’ to me?)
Gabby (better pay attention ‘cause I)
Gabby (‘cause I wanted you to be the one)
And the one la la la la la
And the one la la la la la
And the one la la la la la
La la la la la

[Outro: Syd the Kyd]
Sucks that you run away, walk away
I wanted you to be the one
Be the one
Be the one (to choose?)
Da da dum yeah yeah

Shut up, Janelle
Shut up
