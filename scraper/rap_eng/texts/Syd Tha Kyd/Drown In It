[Verse]
If you want me to
I'll try to make it right
Put it all aside for you love
If you only knew
The way I feel inside
It might make up for time
It's my pride
Surprise, surprise
But if you're ready, babe
Are you ready, baby?

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna
Swim in it
Dive in it
Drown in it
Hide in it, babe
Live in it
Die in it
Ride in it
Inside of it, babe
Swallow it
Follow it
Fall in it
All in it, baby
