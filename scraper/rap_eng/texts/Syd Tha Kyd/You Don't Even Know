[Verse 1]
You're beautiful
You brighten up my day
And when your skin touches mine
I get goosebumps right away

[Hook]
But you don't even know
Don't even know, know
I said you don't even know
Don't even know, know (said you don't even know)

[Verse 2]
As usual
I long your embrace
I'm a fiend for your attention
Yes I am baby

[Hook]
But you don't even know
Don't even know, know
I said you don't even know
Don't even know, know (said you don't even know)

You have no idea (said you don't even know)
You have no idea (said you don't even know)

But you don't even know
Don't even know, know
I said you don't even know
Don't even know, know (said you don't even know)

[Verse 3: Tay Walker]
If you only knew
How I look at you
You'd call me crazy
But maybe it's you who
Who hasn't a clue

[Hook]
And you should already know
Already know, already know
Said you should
Already know
Already know, already know

[Verse 4]
You're the reason
I'm singing this song
When I say that
You're the beat in my heart, baby

[Hook]
And you should already know
Already know, already know
Said you should
Already know
Already know, already know

You have no idea (said you don't even know)
You have no idea (said you don't even know)

But you don't even know
Don't even know, know
I said you don't even know
Don't even know, know (said you don't even know)

[Bridge: Tay Walker]
You don't even know
You have no idea
You don't even know
You have no idea
(Repeat)

[Outro]
You don't even know
You don't even know
You don't even know
You don't even know, know,know
You don't even know, know,know
You don't even know, know,know
Yeah
You don't even know
You don't even know
