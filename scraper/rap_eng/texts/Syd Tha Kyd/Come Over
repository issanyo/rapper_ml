[Intro]
Hello
Hey
You at home right now?
Nah, not yet
Hit me up when you get home
Call me when you get home
Like 15 minutes
You busy later?
Just keep me posted
I’ll probably be at home honestly
Call me
Call me
Call me

[Chorus]
Know you wrong
But ‘sho you right
Home alone
For the night
I can turn you on
With my dirty mind
Say I won’t
Worth a try
Puppy love
Butterflies
Made you blush
You made me smile
What you want
Baby you decide
Why we grown
Wasting time

[Verse]
You’re beautiful babe
You’re really something
Stylin’ I gotta say
T-shirt, designer jeans
You got me open
Filled with emotion
Living in ecstacy
Just want you next to me
I’ll bring the champagne
Don’t turn me down babe
We can play Simon Says
Or watch TV in bed
Wake with the sunrise
Sleep in it’s alright
Ain’t even gotta sex

[Bridge]
Mmm but, I know what you like
Baby
Can I come over, come over?
You’re wasting your time
Baby

[Pre-Chorus]
If you just let me come over babe
If you just let me come over babe

[Chorus]
Know you wrong
But ‘sho you right
Home alone
For the night
I can turn you on
With my dirty mind
Say I won’t
Worth a try
Puppy love
Butterflies
Made you blush
You made me smile
What you want
Baby you decide
Why we grown
Wasting time
(Steve)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you just let me come over babe
If you just let me come over babe

[Chorus]
Know you wrong
But ‘sho you right
Home alone
For the night
I can turn you on
With my dirty mind
Say I won’t
Worth a try
Puppy love
Butterflies
Made you blush
You made me smile
What you want
Baby you decide
Why we grown
Wasting time

[Interlude]
Ayy yo
You called yourself being rude to me?
Fuck you too, you little broke...you...

[Outro: Steve Lacy]
These bitches want diamond rings, Birk' bags and other bling
I just don't feel the same
Vanity's not my thing
These bitches want diamond rings, Birk' bags and other bling
I just don't feel the same
Vanity's not my thing
These bitches want diamond rings
These bitches want diamond rings
