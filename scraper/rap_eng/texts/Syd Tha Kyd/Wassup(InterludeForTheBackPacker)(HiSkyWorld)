Alright , calling all the artist , Hiri go the hardest , turning ya'll to veggie plates, ya'll just be just harvest a target since met that one chick in target who treated my heart like one not knowing I wasn't garbage , cause when I flip these tracks like my weave in wrong , I leave em like scrap we'll leave you alone , purple dinosaur my scent weed could be ya cologne , here's the answer to ya question dog I ball like Malone , on the stove , I will cook watch you look as I go , tryna argue up with me nah dog watch ya tone , actually I'm feeling cold but I don't know why , with these super dirty vans , I'm a different type of fly , I'm a different type of hi , just add the ri anti-swagg , drop the swagg and add a dash Christ but me I believe in a being in the sky , who will come 3 years past 2009 but enough about religion I'm just spitting watch me kill em , I'm a cobra taste my Venom, Hiri sheen I'm just winning yeah , who wanna battle with me , lyrically I'm a fiend to express I'm a beats , wassup ...
