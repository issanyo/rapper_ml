[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Pull up on my job and make ‘em go work
We hit the singles club, her hips are double time
Got three finals this week but she don't care she get some money first
I understand to feel myself, I started from the dirt
Now I’m just like clean, our goal is to flip a silver dollar out a dream
I mean it looks just how it seems
Apologize if that came off as open-ended
She took it as back-handed and got offended
Like you know what, you no different
You think every bitch is the same
And boy don't you know them chips can dip as quick as they came
I came to the scene she want the taste of the F-A-M-E
At the end she want a lick of that co-co-co-cocaine
Tell you like your voice, let your hips do the talking
Contrary to what you think they really say this often
But watching you whine make me really wanna know
Would you mind, if you with it we can go

[Hook: Syd the Kyd]
Girl, just go with it
Lose control, just roll with it
Take your time
You're learnin’, baby
Girl, it's all good

[Verse 2: Syd the Kyd]
By the way, I knew she was looking for me
By the way that she crossed her legs
I knew she wanted somethin', lovin', going all the way
Baby, if you let me I can show you how to loosen up
Take a chance and dance with me, relax and let your hair down
I really want to be with you, and I know you want me too, babe
It’s you, babe

[Hook: Syd the Kyd]
Girl, just go with it
Lose control, just roll with it
Take your time (Take your time)
You're learnin’, baby
Girl, it's all good (Girl)

[Bridge: Syd the Kyd]
It’s alright, babe, alright, babe
You know you got me giving it up
You know you like me, like me
Baby go with the flow (ahh)
Oh, yeah

[Interlude: Syd the Kyd]
Shake shake, shake shake
Shake shake, shake shake, ooh
Shake shake, shake shake
Shake shake, shake shake
Don’t stop baby, don’t stop baby, ooh
Shake shake, shake shake
Shake shake, shake shake

[Spoken Interlude: Syd the Kyd]
Hey, what you doing after this?
Word, well um
Won’t you go get your friends
Lets get out of here
Ready?

[Hook: Syd the Kyd]
Girl, just go with it
Lose control, just roll with it
Take your time
You're learnin’, baby, ooh
Girl, it's all good
