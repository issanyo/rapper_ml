[Verse 1- Matt Martians]
Open the door
I look you in your face, realize I don't love you no more
You ask me why
Reoccurring thoughts of him are there
You'll never understand
You
You asked to be put on this level and I ignored you
And now I see
What life is like without you there
So the bong is where I stare

[Hook- Syd tha Kyd]
Girl
You know I love you, girl
You know I care
Girl
You know I love you, girl
You know I care

[Verse 2- Syd tha Kyd]
Rain clouds
Seem to like to follow me around since I lost you
Ask me how
I could leave with something so small and unsure like I didn't love you anymore
But you
Pushed me to a level of insanity, I know
Now, all I ask
Is if I ever had a chance
Or were we never gonna last

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Pyramid Vritra]
Texting me "I love you" as you were getting dicked down by an old flame
At least you asked first while you would flirt at them home games
Fuck it I'll let it slide, like everything that you do
For everything thing that you do, innocent girl in school
But as the moonlight crept in to her vacant room
She she's in the cooper
Naked, breaking curfew, nuts, and zippers too
Sea ocean blue after the hundredth argument
Dipped just as quick as you
Re-equiped with a new beau and my crush hates me now
I'm 50 states away, still asking about your day
And If you listen to the album I sent you
You shouldn't expect an answer
And it's it fine
Shit, I'll find some new bitches, and if you do return
By any chance, it stands that you want me
I'll be in the same state you left me
Alone
Or maybe I'll be with a bad bitch and I'll reject you
And tell you that you're nothing special
But you are
But I probably won't
