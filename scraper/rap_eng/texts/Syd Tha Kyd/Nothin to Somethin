[Verse 1]
I’m too much off the goose so gimme the juice
Too picky to choose out of all of you
These bitches kiss and tell but I wish em well
I'm just overzealous they think I’m selfish
But I’m working on my wellness, hustle for my health
And I keep pushing this product til there's nothing on the shelf
If I go to hell hope my bitches get to visit
Meet at my hotel make another bad decision you with it I’m

[Chorus]
Sipping on something that's bubbling
They all hating we love it it's just the beginning of it ya know
This for my youngins my cousins
I turned nothing to something so I'ma collect this money fasho
(Come on, come on, come on) Talk to me like
(Come on, come on, come on) Talk to me like
(Come on, come on, come on) We turned nothing to something
(Come on, come on, come on)

[Verse 2]
Introduce you to the new me, my life’s a movie
All I need is a Karreuche, these women choosing
Hop yo ass in this jacuzzi and bring it to me
You know I’m the truth but you wanna see the proof well
You know what to do
Don't get confused girl I'm focused
This isn't news girl you know this
Just be my muse for tonight I
Might change your life so if you change your mind I'll be
Here

[Chorus]
Sipping on something that's bubbling
They all hating we love it it's just the beginning of it ya know
This for my youngins my cousins
I turned nothing to something so I'ma collect this money fasho
(Come on, come on, come on) Talk to me like
(Come on, come on, come on) Talk to me like
(Come on, come on, come on) We turned nothing to something
(Come on, come on, come on)

Sipping on something that's bubbling
They all hating we love it it's just the beginning of it ya know
This for my youngins my cousins
I turned nothing to something so I'ma collect this money fasho
(Come on, come on, come on) Talk to me like
(Come on, come on, come on) Talk to me like
(Come on, come on, come on) We turned nothing to something
