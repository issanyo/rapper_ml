[Verse 1: Syd]
It was like, 10-somethin', cool summer
Ride 'round bumpin' on my new shit
Wonder what you doin', and who you wit'
Can I scoop ya, we can groove girl
It's up to you, up to you
I just want you in my presence
Don't go actin' like you don't love the attention
I could be there in a second
Get ready girl

[Chorus: Syd & QUIÑ]
I am not your average, posin' for the cameras
Always trying to be seen
See, me, I'd rather go pick up a bad one
Tell her roll a fat one
Drive till we get hungry
The simple things (you know wassup)
The simple things (you know wassup)

[Verse 2: Chuck Inglish]
Can I get the fries on the side with a small milkshake
Try to avoid the 101 when you come this way (for real)
No matter what happens, you hit L.A. traffic
So I roll two for the road, we gon' be starving
Keep the fist on my comb when I pick out my 'fro
Let the hair flow in the wind, skin like cinnamon
Brown butter baby and your bathing suit is wavy
And that line down the side of your thigh, drive me crazy
It's the little shit
Long top Chucks with the anklet
Small gold chain with my name in it, you saving me
It's simple like your chin dimples, smiling gets deep
Remembering the first time I caught you in my t-shirt
We kicked back, lit that, sipped that on ice
Clipped that, laid back, talked about life
I'm loving where we goin'
I don't need much, I just love that you know that

[Bridge: QUIÑ]
You know, you know wassup
You know that so long as I'm with you, you're all that I want (all that I)
Baby, you know I hate it, though
I hate the part of the baggage I'm packing, your darling [?]
And you can leave me for good (leave me for good)

[Chorus: Syd & QUIÑ]
I am not your average, posin' for the cameras
Always trying to be seen
See, me, I'd rather go pick up a bad one
Tell her roll a fat one
Drive till we get hungry
The simple things (you know wassup)
The simple things (you know wassup)

[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]
Now let me ask you, is it still fun?
As it was, back when y'all was first hooking up
That's a rush, you shouldn't rush it on your itinerary, fill up quick
Gonna start to be a little too much, shit
With the obligations, the interviews on the phone at the gate, wait
For the plane that's supposed to take us on a vacation (uh-huh)
While you was trippin', I was in the dungeon
Writin' hits, and yup, I bet they love it
The unsigned nigga with the budget
A long time coming, motherfuckers
The time better now than any other
So girl listen up, you missin' it, here go your chance
They got the bright lights on you, hope you know the dance
You need a drink, got the ice with her [?]
So drop a man then you going HAM
Cuz man, all of these projections, and all of these suggestions
Make relationships age even quicker
Girl, that's how the game go

[Chorus: Syd & QUIÑ]
I am not your average, posin' for the cameras
Always trying to be seen
See, me, I'd rather go pick up a bad one
Tell her roll a fat one
Drive till we get hungry
The simple things (you know wassup)
The simple things (you know wassup)
