[Verse 1]
Speedin’ in a black Jeep, headed to the freeway
If anybody slows down, it’s a problem
Kilos in the backseat, million in the briefcase
Yo, if anybody finds out, Imma rob ‘em

[Hook]
Maybe I can say I've made some mistakes in the past
But this is today, not a care in the world
Just me and my girl, it’s okay
I welcome the rain

[Bridge]
Oh I gave you all the storm that you could weather
One day can turn into forever
And who would’ve thought we’d end up on the run, the run

[Interlude]
Just put your foot on the gas now, go, go, go
Aye, promise this’ll be the last time

[Verse 2]
Beatin’ down the backstreets, feelin’ like a street race
Won’t let a nigga find out, there’s some cops on the way
Done a lot of bad deeds, but tryna live easy
Partner right beside me, try to stop us

[Hook]
Maybe I can say I've made some mistakes in the past
But this is today not a care in the world
Just me and my girl, it’s okay
I welcome the rain

[Bridge]
You stood beside me through the stormy weather
You know one little storm could last forever
And who would’ve thought we’d end up on the run, the run

[Outro]
If we ever get away, I’ll be sure
Sure not to make the same mistakes as before
I know you would die for me, won’t you babe?
You already ride for me, don’t you babe?
