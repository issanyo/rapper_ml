Missing you
Is nothing like I thought it'd be
It's harder, baby
And loving you
Is great but sometimes we just have to move on
Yeah

Know I keep my head held high
I still get choked up inside
At the thought of you

I try so hard to be strong
But it's hard to carry on without you
Yeah

But I'm okay
I'm on a rise
Nothing's gonna stop me from gettin' it
But I'm okay
I'm on a rise
Nothing's gonna stop me from gettin' it
