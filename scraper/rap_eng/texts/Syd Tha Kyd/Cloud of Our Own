[Hook]
Lovin you is so wonderful
Like butterflies and waterfalls
Keep me high above it all
On a cloud of our own

We ain't got to be ashamed
On what we're trying to do
This ain't no play date
It's only natural ,Ain't funny
How you make my worries fade away
Run run run
Why do you keep calling me
Takin' over all of me
Fit together perfectly
So suddenly you're all I need
How do you keep holdin' me
Suddenly controlling me
They say that you're wrong for me
But I like that you belong to me

[Hook]

They say a villain
And they might be right
They think it's too much
But they don't get high
Cause I can't help it
If you move me like the way I like to be moved
Why do you keep calling me
Takin' over all of me
Fit together perfectly
So suddenly you're all I need
How do you keep hold of me
Suddenly controlling me
They say that you're wrong for me
But I like that you belong to me
