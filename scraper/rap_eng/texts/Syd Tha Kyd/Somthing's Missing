Part 1

[Verse]
It’s a full tank in the getaway, get away
So before I break your heart, you should get the engine started
There’s nothing like a nice drive in the Summertime
Sunshine with the groove goin’ to help you move on
So get a move on, get your mood right maybe start a new life

[Pre-Hook]
And you’re wondering
What to do and where to go
Tell me not to do it, babe
I don’t feel the same about you anymore

[Hook]
Don't get caught up lovin' me
I know it don't make sense
You’re perfect on paper, baby
But something’s missing
Don’t get caught up lovin' me
Girl, I’m no good for you
It has nothing to do because it’s just another season

[Interlude]
I don’t wanna be without you, babe
I don’t wanna be without you, babe
I don’t wanna be without you, babe
I don’t wanna be without you, babe

[Bridge]
I just think I’m way too young to fall in love
Sign of the times I guess
Maybe in another season
Imma be trying to find someone like you

[Interlude]
Don’t get caught up lovin’ me
Don’t get caught up lovin’ me

[Bridge]
I just think I’m way too young to fall in love
Sign of the times I guess
Maybe in another season
Imma be trying to find someone like you

Part 2

She only wanna get down
When no one's around
She only wanna get down
When no one's around

She only wanna get down
When no one's around
She only wanna get down
When no one's around

She only wanna get down
When no one's around
She only wanna get down
When no one's around
