[Verse 1: David Longstreth]
The sky has darkened, earth turned to hell
Some said a light got shined where darkness dwelt
So I won't cry or collapse, overwhelmed
Time like a song just might rhyme with itself

[Pre-Chorus 1: David Longstreth]
I don't know how I'm going to be a better man
I don't know how I'm going to reach the Promised Land
I don't know how I'm going to get you to take my hand
But I'm going to try and I know when

[Chorus: David Longstreth + Syd]
Now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now, now (now)
Right now, now (now)
Right now, now (now)
Right now

[Verse 2: David Longstreth]
Soon the earth may dissolve like snow
We'll meet again in the air all bound to glow
And I am glad that I got to know
I might sing the melody
But I don't set the tempo

[Pre-Chorus 2: David Longstreth]
Who draws the true straw from the fist that's clasped?
Who pulls the new rope through the loopholes of the past?
Better hurry up for the first shall be the last
Better sound the trumpet before the blast

[Chorus: David Longstreth + Syd]
Now (now)
Right (now)
Now, right (now)
Now, right now (now)
Right now (now)
Now, right now (now)
Now, right now (now)
Now, right now

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
You pulled me up when you took my hand
There was silence in my heart
And now I'm striking up the band
They lit the bonfire but now we can light the lamp

[Chorus: David Longstreth + Syd]
Now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now (now)
Right now, now (now)
Right now (now, now)
Right now (now, now)
Right now (now, now)
Right now (now, now)
Right now (now, now)
Right now (now)
Now, right now, now, now, now, now
