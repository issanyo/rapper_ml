[The Real Roxanne]
I'm the lady devastator, plain and simple
Some of my friends know me as Dimples
But ladies in the place, I want you to know
About this guy named Romeo

Howie Tee the Hitman, hit me!

I was hanging with the girls when he walked in
This real fine guy in the blue sheepskin
The music was kickin', my heart was tickin'
Tried to his attention, but nothing was clickin'
My friend says "Girl, don't you know?"
"That is the guy they call Romeo."
Then it was plain to see, that this guy was right for me
So I danced his way looking real sweet
I said "Why are you filled with such conceit?"
He said "I've been this way ever since
I'm not conceited, I'm just convinced."
I said "Excuse me!", he said "You're excused."
I said "Boy, you know who you're talking to?
I'm the real, and you know the deal
And right about now, I ma tell you how I feel
I'm not your friend, I'm not your lover
And I'm so glad I'm not your mother
'Cause if I was, I would hide
Or better yet, commit suicide
So now, what do you have to say?"
You know the boy just yawned and walked away?
But I still tried, I can't lie
Something attracts me to this guy
At night I cried, but my pride
Makes me dance from side to side

[Chorus]
A here we go! (Ro-me-o!)
Hit it! (Ro-me-o-o!)
A here we go! (Ro-me-o!)
Hit it! (Ro-me-o-o!)

Then: took off my coat and I got loose
Grabbed the mic from the DJ's booth
I said Romeo, let it be the R-O-X-A-N-N-E
The X in the middle is the way it would be
If only I could make you see
But Romeo wasn't even fazed
He reached in his pocket pulled out his shades
Patted his hair, tipped up his collar
And bet every guy in the place ten dollars
That he could pull me as easy as thread
When Howie Tee heard, here's what he said:
[Howie Tee]
"They hope you get it, they'd love to see you wit' it
But you just try, and Howie's gonna hit it."

[The Real Roxanne]
When Howie plays he makes the ladies sway, Get it!
Unh, unh, unh, unh, unh, unh, unh, well
Unh, unh, unh, unh, unh, unh, unh
That's right ya'll, that's right ya'll
It's Rox with the box on the mic ya'll
Then he walked over, I turned around
He looked so fine, I almost fell down
He touched my face, my feet got cold
My head started spinning, I lost control
I gave him the number of my home
He said he might ring my phone
And that was all he had to say
He strutted on his way
Then my friend, Sparky D
Walked right up and said to me
"Yo Homegirl, he ain't worth the fight."
I said "Yeah, you're probably right."
But I still tried, I can't lie
Something attracts me to this guy
At night I cried, but my pride
Makes me dance from side to side

[Chorus]
A here we go! (Ro-me-o!)
Hit it! (Ro-me-o-o!)
A here we go! (Ro-me-o!)
Hit it! (Ro-me-o-o!)
And if you're interested at all, give me a call

Well I guess I keep a-tryin' cause the music ain't dyin'
Gonna stop my cryin', and I'm not lyin'
'Cause I'm fed up, I'm telling you so
From this point on here's how it goes
I don't need no (Romeo!)
I don't need no (Romeo!)
I don't need no (Romeo!)
The Real Roxanne wants you to know
Ladies in the place I want you to know
We are the ones that's running this show

[Chorus]
(Ro-me-o!)
Hit it! (Ro-me-o-o!)
Get live Howie Tee!
