[Verse 1]
[Kid]
I’ve just seen a vision from across the room
Old Cupid has hit me like a sonic boom
Contact eye to eye, it thrills my world
But I’m a little shy when it comes to girls
But I attempt to utter, I stammer and stutter
My heart’s beating fast and the butterflies flutter inside of me
It’s the pride in me, so I know these feelings won’t subside in me

[The Real Roxanne]
My emotions come off that were held within
Every move represents the ultimate sin
I try to be calm, I try to play cute
But you’re tempting me like forbidden fruit
I realize you didn’t come to this party alone
And I’m also trapped with a guy of my own
So here’s a clue (before we rendezvous)
I think it’s best if it’s kept between me and you
That we’re…

[Chorus]
Undercover…undercover
Undercover…undercover

[Verse 2]
[The Real Roxanne]
I never meant to stare, it started as a peek
It was your eyes, your hair, and your physique
Gonna play the role, gotta keep control
But you captured my mind, my body, and soul
No, I gotta stop, get you outta my mind
But the only way I could is if I was blind
‘Cause every time I look, boy, you got me hooked
Like a thief in the night, my heart you took

[Kid]
I want the one I’m with, but I want you too
And for the first time, I don’t know what to do
Now enough’s enough, my girl’s right at hand
Further thoughts could ruin my marriage plans, but
Deeper then, it will never end
My lust and desire are gonna win
(So I’m down if you are, ‘cause I can’t let go)
Just promise no one’s gonna know we’re…

[Chorus]
Undercover…undercover
Undercover…undercover

[Verse 3]
[Kid]
What a way for two souls to finally meet
Making passionate love between the sheets
Going all night long, the feeling is strong
How can it seem so right when we know it’s wrong?
Then the moment is over, under lights so dim
Those feelings of guilt begin to set in

[The Real Roxanne]
So, what should we say now, ‘bout what we just did?
‘Cause any day now, we might get busted
Undercover, overnight, can’t be that sure
Keep outta sight, you better use the back door
And even though I don’t  belong to you
I can’t help it, I find myself drawn to you

[Kid]
The lust that we share is an emotional crime
We both know we’re living on borrowed time
The odds are against us, the deck is stacked

[The Real Roxanne]
But still we keep trying to hide the fact that we’re…

[Chorus]
Undercover…undercover
Undercover…undercover

Undercover
