Just a little bit		(repeated)

(Tell ya, I kinda like her, you know)

I'm the fox that cold rocks, and I'm comin correct
And what I want is a little respect
Now if I don't get it, I'ma have to take it
And prove to y'all that I can make it
All the way, and not slightly
For those of you who took me lightly
I'ma have to put you all in check
And maybe then you'll show me a little respect

Ooh
Just a little bit			(repeated)

(I don't know, with kids today it's different)

You wanna riff, but you can't base
You're captivated by a smile on a pretty face
And of course breath-takin
I proceed goin wild, if I'm not mistaken
I am woman, watch me roar
I don't run my rhymes, they pour
And I don't be takin shorts, I wear em
A rapper diss me, huh, I dare him
Cause if he does that, then he'll be makin
A big mistake, cause I start breakin
And you don't want me to break
When the gold around your neck is fake!
A 24-carat persona, but I'm not Madonna
You come out your neck, and I'ma treat you like your mama
You don't like what I'm sayin, then you can step
Instead give a lady like me a little respect

Ooh
Just a little bit

I can't stop, cause I'm hotter than hot
Bu twhen I see another rapper, I gots
To get wicked and kick it, and put em in check
And let em know the Double R's in effect
And since you're really captivated, super sexy, so seducin
I do the rap, Howie Tee does the producin
I need a scratch, Howie Tee, are you ready?
(Sure) Huh - let's do this

(Tell ya, I kinda like her, you know)

(I don't know, with kids today it's different)

How can you be hotter than July
I will tell you why, your guy
He wants to be my slave
I put him on a short leash, so he can behave
And you cover your face with a paperbag
Cause I'm the kinda girl your man wish he had
And you remind me of the Bride of Frankenstein
Your hair so short that I can read what's on your mind
And since we're on the topic of hair, let me mention
To all the girls that wear extensions
You gotta be like me, and that's legit
And when I put on my jeans, they fit
Cause I'm not lackin, in the back, and
I don't look like I be crackin
Up, Cause my body ain't flat
But yours kinda looks like that
And a lady like me cannot be dismissed
Leave the radio alone, cause you cannot adjust this
And if my tape ain't in the box, then press eject
Just one of the ways you can show me a little respect!

Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit

(I tell ya, I kinda like her, ya know)
