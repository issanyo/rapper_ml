[Chorus]
Walked out Gucci then crossed the street (fuck it)
Upset stomach, I had to eat (ooh)
Walked in Louis and spent six Gs (fuck it)
Ran out of Swishers to stuff the weed (ooh)
Walked in Shell (ooh), flamed up a L (ooh)
Bumpy Margiels (ooh), feel like braille (ooh)
Dirty ass ginger ale (ooh), came through the mail (ooh)
I fucked your girl (ooh), in the hotel (ooh)

[Verse 1]
Fast ass two-door parked up the street
Hope you don't try it, I'll up the piece
Went to Miami and hit STORY
My bitch on a OG gas diet, just weed, no meat (ooh, ooh)
Dirty ass pop (ooh), shook it with the top (top)
Drinkin' while I shop, took it with two yops (yops)
Make the coupe fast just to get way from the cops (cops)
Your bitch is popped, motor non-stop (stop)

[Chorus]
Walked out Gucci then crossed the street (fuck it)
Upset stomach, I had to eat (ooh)
Walked in Louis and spent six Gs (fuck it)
Ran out of Swishers to stuff the weed (ooh)
Walked in Shell (ooh), flamed up a L (ooh)
Bumpy Margiels (ooh), feel like braille (ooh)
Dirty ass ginger ale (ooh), came through the mail (ooh)
I fucked your girl (ooh), in the hotel (ooh)

[Verse 2]
Lean 650, I up the kit (fiend)
Hope you ain't kiss her, she sucked my dick (ooh)
Let my mans fuck her, I set the pick
Up until the bitch started fussin', it didn't get shit (shit shit)
Might but a Jag (Jag), if it not the Bent (Bent)
How much for it cash (cash), I wasn't tryna rent (rent)
Smoking strong gas (gas), I done just went through a zip (zip)
Bought a four pack (pack), did it just to flip (flip)

[Chorus]
Walked out Gucci then crossed the street (fuck it)
Upset stomach, I had to eat (ooh)
Walked in Louis and spent six Gs (fuck it)
Ran out of Swishers to stuff the weed (ooh)
Walked in Shell (ooh), flamed up a L (ooh)
Bumpy Margiels (ooh), feel like braille (ooh)
Dirty ass ginger ale (ooh), came through the mail (ooh)
I fucked your girl (ooh), in the hotel (ooh)
