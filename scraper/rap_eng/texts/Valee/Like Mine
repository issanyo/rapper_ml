[Intro]
Valee
You ain't seen a bitch like mine
When you tryna let me know?

[Hook]
You ain't seen no bitch like mine, she got Gucci on her toes
You buying, swing my motherfucking door
This mine, this my motherfucking hoe
Two racks on the motherfucking coat
Find one like mine, let me know
Find one like mine, let me know
Find one like mine, let me know
Find one like mine, let me know

[Verse]
Sit at the light, [?]
Shoes match your shirt, shirt match your bitch
Popping Adderall, sipping Actavis
Not Tylenol, I'ma tax for this
My bitch wear my trousers, that's a trappy bitch
Molly hit you raw, like a bass hit
I got slides on, fuck them laces
I left out the room, she got naked

[Hook]
You ain't seen no bitch like mine, she got Gucci on her toes
You buying, swing my motherfucking door
This mine, this my motherfucking hoe
Two racks on the motherfucking coat
Find one like mine, let me know
Find one like mine, let me know
Find one like mine, let me know
Find one like mine, let me know
