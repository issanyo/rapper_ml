[Intro]
I hit the lot for the fast one
I want the one with the digital dash

[Hook 1]
I hit the lot for the fast one
I want the one with the digital dash
I put the racks in the stash
Then I pull off with the digital dash

[Post-Hook]
Is your bankroll, up?
Fuck your bankroll, up
Get your bankroll, up
Uh

[Hook 2]
I hit the lot for the fast one
I want the one with the digital dash

[Verse 1]
I left the lot with the fast one
I got the one with the digital
I got this shit for the minimum
My bitch is bad and she [?]
She like it when I’m up in her
I stack it up like a building
They [?] me, I don’t picture them
I just poured syrup up, dirtied up the whole cup
I just put your girl up
I hit the store with the cash
I spend it quick and I make it back fast
Aye

Fuck your bankroll, up
Get your bankroll, up
Uh

[Hook 2]

[Verse 2]
I see the bitch in the camera
I got the 40 or bigger
Margiela more than a nigga
She wanna kick it, Jiu Jitsu
I made the bitch hold a pistol
She textin’ to say, “I miss you”
I got them blue faces issues
Know these bitches whole sluts
I ain’t even know her
Play me like a go-kart
I put the racks in the bag
Then I pull off in the coupe with no tags, uh

Fuck your bankroll, up
Get your bankroll, up
Uh
