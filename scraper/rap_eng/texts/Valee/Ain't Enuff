I took the OG and rolled it up
I took the codeine and poured it up
A two door coupe is all I start up
Got my lil boo all designer'd up
I sip the lean 'til it ain't enough
I smoke OG 'til it ain't none left
A two door coupe is all I start up
Got my lil boo all designer'd up

[Verse 1]
Margielas, boo, cost a thousand bucks (a thousand bucks)
Too much seafood, I had slow it up (had slow it up)
Too many racks, I can't fold it up (can't fold it up)
Bought some Raf Simonds and fucked them up (fucked them up)

This bitch I'm with don't want no one else (don't want no one else)

Bitch think she know me, but she do not
Call me 'bout nothin' and you get blocked
I'm smokin' OG, it from the docks
Got one up top in that plastic Glock
My bitch gon' shoot if I tell her to
Look at my shoe and they Christian Loubs
Me and your bitch do what you don't do
Made her come out the lingerie too

I'm shoppin' Gucci, ain't got my pet
Just took the hundreds and fucked them up
Took all the 50s and put them up
