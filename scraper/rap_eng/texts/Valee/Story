[Intro]
I woke up gettin' some head
I ain't even hopped out the bed

[Verse]
I woke up gettin' some head
I ain't even hopped out the bed
I'm noticin' she a lil thicker
Tattoos all over her leg
I'm lookin' for something to watch
I lit the OG instead
10 minutes passed on the clock
I'm in this bitch watchin' Ted
I heard this knock at the door
I grabbed the pistol, "Who is it?"
I got this one nigga ho
She popped the flat drunk and missed it
I'm lookin' through the peephole
It was the plug with the shit
I told her she had to go
You know this bitch threw a fit
10 minutes after they left
I grabbed the keys out the kitchen
I parked the coupe by the hydrant
I'm knowin' they gave me a ticket
They did this shit once before
I'm already knowin' they bitches
I'm hoppin' inside the two door
I'm already knowin' you dig it

[Chorus]
I'm sippin' lean, politickin'
I fucked a bitch who from Britain
I stuff the blunt with nutrition
Percocet with no condition
I get it from the physician
I make the bitch switch positions
I did this shit once before
I did this shit once before
I'm sippin' lean, politickin'
I did this shit once before
I fucked a bitch who from Britain
I did this shit once before
I stuff the blunt with nutrition
I did this shit once before
Percocet with no condition
