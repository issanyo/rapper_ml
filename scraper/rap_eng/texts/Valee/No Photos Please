[Intro]
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

[Chorus: TJay Wave]
I pound on your main thing, I smoke out the LB
I got my money right, it ain't shit you could tell me
My bread different colors like batter and berries
Yeah, I got a habit, yeah, I gotta get it
I might just say "Fuck it" and pull out the Chevy
She told me I cannot cum in her mouth
I had to ask that lil heifer, "Why you actin' petty?"
It come to these hoes, I'm a monster like Eddie
Finessin', ain't that many niggas this scary
Don't end up a dead man, this shit feel like jelly
It look like graffiti on my new Burberry
Back hallway, was trappin', I had two Blackberries
You know I'm a hustler, sell sand in the desert
Finesse and get extra, the plug got my drank
I'm like hurry and mail it
I might just sip it or I might just sell it
A hundred a zip, hit my line when you ready

[Post-Chorus: TJay Wave]
Mercedes AMG
Push start, don't take no key
Foreign take 93
Only smoke 93
Government name on my codeine
Private location with two freaks
They give me all throat, no teeth
Not tonight, no photos please

[Verse: Valee]
In the valley playin' YG 400
Versaces, they hundred, you already won 'em
I bought some VLONE and already lost it
Off-White bookbag, black and white caution
My bitch in veneers and she overfloss 'em
Ice on my necklace look like a snowcone
I fucked the bitch once and I made her go home
I might leave her runnin', I won't be that long
My shit got no service, I'm lettin' it roam
My Yorkie go missin', I got a chip in it
You had a late start on the paper, indent it
You askin' me how the fuck my 6s fittin'
My motor hot, can't even touch it with mittens
My bitch got an ass, you can see when she sittin'
I'm scratchin' off in the coupe like the road itchin'
My exotic smell like you lightin' the incense

[Chorus: TJay Wave]
I pound on your main thing, I smoke out the LB
I got my money right, it ain't shit you could tell me
My bread different colors like batter and berries
Yeah, I got a habit, yeah, I gotta get it
I might just say "Fuck it" and pull out the Chevy
She told me I cannot cum in her mouth
I had to ask that lil heifer, "Why you actin' petty?"
It come to these hoes, I'm a monster like Eddie
Finessin', ain't that many niggas this scary
Don't end up a dead man, this shit feel like jelly
It look like graffiti on my new Burberry
Back hallway, was trappin', I had two Blackberries
You know I'm a hustler, sell sand in the desert
Finesse and get extra, the plug got my drank
I'm like hurry and mail it
I might just sip it or I might just sell it
A hundred a zip, hit my line when you ready
