[Intro]
Rio, Rio, Rio, Rio

[Verse]
My bitch ass is smooth like Reposado, I hang with Mexicanos
Never wanted a condo, ain't got the windows or condos
Alloy 5-blade Vellanos, no tire shine, leave that dry, dry
I bought my mama a sawed off, bye bye
Bitches still live outside all I make is knots, not ties
Chase bitches, not on my time, can't hit me less on the 5 side
But no, I'm not no Stone, it's stones on my left wrist, my neck too
Bought my bitch a Pandora bracelet, no glis' but her neck do
Me and my niggas come up on you like front steps do
Got money stacked too tall, had go get a step stool
Don't run up, I shoot y'all, nobody gon' help you
My wet slut live in Duval, swimmin' like Michael Phelps do
Your pocket flat like wall, I'm high like a John Wall oop
I can't deny, y'all, my bitch wet

[Chorus]
My diamonds clear like motherfuckin' juice and gin (diamonds)
Fuck my Pasadena bitch from back to Juice & Gin
I got aim with that small 9, I fuck 'round, shoot your chin
Percocet hit you so hard, might drop your juice and gin
Diamonds clear like motherfuckin' juice and gin (diamonds)
Fuck my Pasadena bitch from back to Juice & Gin
I got aim with that small 9, I fuck 'round, shoot your chin
Percocet hit you so hard, might drop your juice and gin
Diamonds clear like motherfuckin' juice and gin
