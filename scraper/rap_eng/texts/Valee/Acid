[Intro]
Acid
Bitch, I might crash that
Crash that
And this beat by ChaseTheMoney
ChaseTheMoney

[Chorus]
I got two bitches doing acid, they got asses
Poured a pint of Actavis in plastic
I just roll the OG gas up, and then I passed it (oh yeah)
Got that white SuperSport, it's a classic (shit)
You was in school, I was skipping classes (oh yeah)
Fucked a bitch for five minutes, that's how long it lasted (shit)
She gave the blunt back to me and I ashed it (ashed it)
I had took a stack to Gucci and bought some glasses (spent it)

[Verse]
I went to sleep on a Tempurpedic mattress, sheets were satin (shit)
Got this blonde-haired bad bitch, look like an actress
Brought me five racks, I let her keep a fraction (oh yeah)
What I did for her last week, that was past tense (back then)
I was in a Benz last week with the black tints
And the seat next to me, had my side bitch
She was on Facetime with a bad bitch
Told me send her location with directions (oh yeah)

[Chorus]
I got two bitches doing acid, they got asses (they did)
Poured a pint of Actavis in plastic
I just roll the OG gas up, and then I passed it
Got that white SuperSport, it's a classic
You was in school, I was skipping classes (yeah)
Fucked a bitch for five minutes, that's how long it lasted (that's how long it lasted)
She gave the blunt back to me and I ashed it
I had took a stack to Gucci and bought some glasses

[Outro]
And this beat by ChaseTheMoney

I got two bitches doing acid, they got asses
