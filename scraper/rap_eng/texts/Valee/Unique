[Verse 1]
I ash on the digital dash
I smash on the pedal, it snatch
I shift, it jerk when it catch
I roll up OG out the batch
And my designer don't even match
Behind this bitch, from the back
My cup of codeine look like 'Gnac
This bitch want a Perc and a flat
And I ain't posted up like a [?]
This coupe without the paper tag
And I love the money so bad
I fuck it up and get it back
And I treat the coupe all cheap
I want the motor in back
And I ain't pourin' codeine in my tea
These jeans I got on cost 10 racks

[Chorus]
I got my own
I stack my bread up
Got your ho on the phone
I fuck a cheque up
Oh, yes I did
I treat a slut bitch like they ain't shit
I treat the two door like it ain't shit
I buy the codeine if it ain't hit
I pour a four and I sipped it quick
I got my own
I stack my bread up
Got your ho on the phone
I pick a bag up
Oh, yes I did
I got this pistol on the back seat
I got this bitch, that's the most you need
I stack the blue faces tall as me
I got the camera in back of me

[Verse 2]
I got the seat back in the Jag
I smoke by the zip, not the bags
I'm spendin' the money too fast
I'm already knowin' you mad
I fuck up a check and a bag
I got the bitch chasin' the cash
She walk in with all of the bags
Just because I fuck with you
I was smokin' dope with you
I'm switchin' lanes, drivin' too fast
You knowin' these kicks is stacked
The coupe always smellin' like gas
And I got the .40 with the beam
And I start it up without the key
And I get the hoes by the 3
And I got different drugs in my pee
I stuff blue faces all in the stash
I got 200 all on the dash
I done spilled codeine on my floor mat
I pick the dope up from over there

[Chorus]
I got my own
I stack my bread up
Got your ho on the phone
I fuck a cheque up
Oh, yes I did
I treat a slut bitch like they ain't shit
I treat the two door like it ain't shit
I buy the codeine if it ain't hit
I pour a four and I sipped it quick
I got my own
I stack my bread up
Got your ho on the phone
I pick a bag up
Oh, yes I did
I got this pistol on the back seat
I got this bitch, that's the most you need
I stack the blue faces tall as me
I got the camera in back of me
