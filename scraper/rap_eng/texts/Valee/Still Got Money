[Intro: Z Money & Valee]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Mmhmm, yeah

[Chorus: Valee]
Dope game payoff, my bitch wet like wishing well
No matter how hard life get, I know I can't chase a bitch
Scratch off in that A8, my bitch stomach losin' weight
Exotic sound like parade, I'm gettin' head like beret
I'm countin' up, eatin' up, payday, my diamonds dancin', reggae
I buy that bitch a G8, she suckin' me up, great
Still got money from high school, I'm no dummy
This yellow bone bitch want me, I put it in her tummy
I buy expensive undies, and still ain't put it on me
She hit my phone, got nothing, I know this bitch want something
Hope you don't run up on me, I'm dumpin' like I'm Humpty
I'm tied up like a drawstring, I'm in some slides, no shoe strings

[Verse: Z Money]
I still got money, re-rockin', you came for me
I'm servin' uncle, aunty, it got me an Ashanti
I'm servin' on the front street, I'm chasin' all this money
Got Vellanos on the concrete, pulled up and I be stuntin'
4EP, we need a trophy, cook dope, I know you know me
Your bitch, she use her both knees, this cup only two doses
I'm so high, I'm in the nosebleeds, two-six when I pull on scene
I'm so high when I'm on the beans, don't pop no fuckin' Xans

[Chorus: Valee]
Dope game payoff, my bitch wet like wishing well
No matter how hard life get, I know I can't chase a bitch
Scratch off in that A8, my bitch stomach losin' weight
Exotic sound like parade, I'm gettin' head like beret
I'm countin' up, eatin' up, payday, my diamonds dancin', reggae
I buy that bitch a G8, she suckin' me up, great
Still got money from high school, I'm no dummy
This yellow bone bitch want me, I put it in her tummy
I buy expensive undies, and still ain't put it on me
She hit my phone, got nothing, I know this bitch want something
Hope you don't run up on me, I'm dumpin' like I'm Humpty
I'm tied up like a drawstring, I'm in some slides, no shoe strings
