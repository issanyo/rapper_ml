[Intro: KAMI]
Superstar
Smoke
Comin' in, comin’ in
Yeah

[Verse 1: KAMI]
Magic City, tour bus pull up, I was in Club Paris (Paris)
Molly and this Patron fifth, I feel so incoherent (coherent)
Had two strippers in the pull up, blue hundreds, count faced up (sup, sup)
Bumps all on her acne makeup, cocaine make her stay up (sup)
Superstar, black Uber car, I'm way up, pull up, laid up (sup, sup)
Seats on decline, seat warm, stretch limo, suit match the decor (it match the decor)
Like I got paid, got diamond, slight necklace and it's on (it’s on)
They dance like reggaeton, I'll take your housewife from your home (Atlanta)
Bought her Loubitons, I'm in the new Yves St. Laurent (Yves St. Laurent)
I got different types, I switch them all out like cellphones (just like cellphones)
It's a marry, fuck, a setup, pull up and the bottles cold
When they let us in the building, we don't walk inside no front

[Chorus: KAMI]
Assorted my new diamonds, they shinin', that's what I did (I swear I did)
Put some Flintstones, lookin' like I take care of my kids (my kids)
They’re very slight, they’re very bright, yes, it's lit
When they ask me, “How much does it really cost?” A bit

[Verse 2: Valee]
New Balenciagas cost 950 dollars (cost 950 dollars)
I might sit down at Ron of Japan, I don’t want Benihana (yeah)
Put my bitch in some new David Yurman, she don't wan' wear Prada
My left wrist look like I wipe off sleds, but I don't do nada (but I don’t do nada)
I popped two Addies, I'm dodgin' beds, sleep happens improper (yeah)
And I'm at the red light gettin' head, need a mattress topper (need a mattress topper)
Bought some Balmain and put bread all inside of the pockets (inside of the pockets)
Got the brand new F&N, don't run up, I would have to spark it (yeah)

[Chorus: KAMI]
Assorted my new diamonds, they shinin', that's what I did (I swear I did)
Put some Flintstones, lookin' like I take care of my kids (my kids)
They're very slight, they're very bright, yes, it's lit
When they ask me, “How much does it really cost?” A bit
Assorted my new diamonds, they shinin', that's what I did (I swear I did)
Put some Flintstones, lookin' like I take care of my kids (my kids)
They're very slight, they're very bright, yes, it's lit
When they ask me, “How much does it really cost?” A bit
