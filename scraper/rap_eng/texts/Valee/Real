[Intro]
How you feeling
How you feeling
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

[Pre-Chorus]
Purse full, four racks, and it's real (huh, and it's real)
Just for her, 'cause I hope it's real (her 'cause I know it's real)
And I spent four racks on high heels (for her only)
I just parked my coupe on a hill (parked my coupe on a hill)

[Chorus]
I was real, real, real, real, real
Real, real, real, real, real
Real, real, real, real, real
Real, real, real

[Verse]
Buy pint and mix it with
A sprite and sip it with
No ice and different
All night up, case she ends
See these, kicks Simon, they up, they hate it
See this bitch I'm with, she updated (this hoe I'm with)
I'm in my foreign, no license, outdated (I'm in my foreign, my license outdated)
I fuck on her first night, it's not dating

[Pre-Chorus]
Purse full, four racks, and it's real (huh, and it's real)
Just for her, 'cause I hope it's real (her 'cause I know it's real)
And I spent four racks on high heels (for her only)
I just parked my coupe on a hill (parked my coupe on a hill)

[Chorus]
I was real, real, real, real, real
Real, real, real, real, real
Real, real, real, real, real
Real, real, real

[Outro]
I was real, real, real, real, real
Real, real, real, real, real
