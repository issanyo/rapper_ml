[Intro: Nike Boi]
Uh
Oh
Uh
Sheesh
Ohh

[Chorus: Nike Boi & Valee]
Ooh, scammer (uh), scanner (uh)
Big planner (uh), David Banner (Banner, Banner)
I don't got no manners (don't got no manners), I don't got no manners (don't got no manners)
Big scammer (uh), big camera (uh)
I'm with a bitch and she thick, I'm a slap it
And the coupe is quick, I'ma smash it
Swoosh, wooh, Nike Boi Woosh
Aye, aye, aye, yo bitch wanna deuce

[Verse 1: Nike Boi & Valee]
No kickin' no flavor
Just got me a taper
I blog with Fader
I’m chasing that bitch, but no I can’t chase her
I custom my whip from washing [?]
I paint that bitch white, same color my tooth
Givenchy diamonds bought that for my poochie
I’m rockin' Nike like Nike Boi Woosh
(Swoosh)

[Chorus: Nike Boi & Valee]
Ooh, scammer (uh), scanner (uh)
Big planner (uh), David Banner (Banner, Banner)
I don't got no manners (don't got no manners), I don't got no manners (don't got no manners)
Big scammer (uh), big camera (uh)
I'm with a bitch and she thick, I'm a slap it
And the coupe is quick, I'ma smash it
Swoosh, wooh, Nike Boi Woosh
Aye, aye, aye, yo bitch wanna deuce

[Verse 2: Valee & Nike Boi]
I call my bitch, she didn't answer, that's okay
I call my other hoe and she answer
She live a lil' closer, I get to that faster
Nine minutes later, bitch, I'm smashin' (I'm smashin')
Ooh, I nut in your granny, I'm part of your family
I’m taxing these niggas, I feel like I’m Sammy
I’m watching yo kid, I am not no nanny
These diamond on wrist, they feeling so fancy
I’m kickin' this shit just like Jackie Chan
She tappin' my pics on Instagram
She wanting a pic I think she fan
And me and Valee, yeah, that my fam

[Chorus: Nike Boi & Valee]
Ooh, scammer (uh), scanner (uh)
Big planner (uh), David Banner (Banner, Banner)
I don't got no manners (don't got no manners), I don't got no manners (don't got no manners)
Big scammer (uh), big camera (uh)
I'm with a bitch and she thick, I'm a slap it
And the coupe is quick, I'ma smash it
Swoosh, wooh, Nike Boi Woosh
Aye, aye, aye, yo bitch wanna deuce

[Outro: Nike Boi]
Scammer, big planner
I don't got no manners, big scammer
