[Intro]
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
Took her shopping in it wasn't no looking back
Looking back
And it wasn't no looking back
Aye

[Refrain]
I just left the car lot, shit, I'm finna get it myself (car lot, aye)
My 26 inches was scraping when I made a left (aye)
I'm like fuck the mall, I'll buy the shit on my phone (aye)
I might fuck 'em all, then I'ma leave her alone (aye)

[Pre-Hook]
I'm walking around looking like I could get Nia Long (like I could get Nia Long)
My bitches bad, looking like, "Nigga, leave me alone" (nigga, leave me alone)

[Hook]
Took her shopping in it wasn't no looking back
Hit it from the back and she kept looking back
I'm buying it, ain't no going to look at that
Behind my bitch, you wanting to look at that

[Verse]
If I see no mileage, that mean there's none on it at all
I'm mixing the molly and lean until it dissolve
I told her stop hitting me, I wasn't gonna answer her call
I told her stop kidding me, I ain't tryna have none at all

[Bridge]
Took her shopping in it with no looking back
[?] my bitch...

[Refrain]
I just left the car lot, shit, I'm finna get it myself (car lot, aye)
My 26 inches was scraping when I made a left (aye)
I'm like fuck the mall, I'll buy the shit on my phone (aye)
I might fuck 'em all, then I'ma leave her alone (aye)

[Pre-Hook]
I'm walking around looking like I could get Nia Long (like I could get Nia Long)
My bitches bad, looking like, "Nigga, leave me alone" (nigga, leave me alone)

[Hook]
Took her shopping in it wasn't no looking back
Hit it from the back and she kept looking back
I'm buying it, ain't no going to look at that
Behind my bitch, you wanting to look at that (know you wanna look at that)
