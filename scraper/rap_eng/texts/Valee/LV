[Intro]

Yeah, yeah
They ask me what I'm doing
Nothing I'm just cooling
With two bad bitches in a two-piece tryna do me

You don't like me? Sue me
I don't do the truies
Walked into the mall and spent it all you know I ball

[Chorus]
I just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought

[Verse 1]
Look, I got a checkered shirt
I'm bout to take him to church
I just got paid on the first
Too clean to be playin in dirt
Got on this shit don't know what it costs
I do this shit like a boss
I'm blessed so I got on the cross
This Louis you got on it costs
You know I'm the difference
I want a brand new Wraith
That means no one has driven
I am so over these bitches
They calling my phone and they trippin
I had to get lonely and distant
Nowadays I only get richer
Left out with a couple of bags
Damn I just fucked up a sack
I had to walk into Neimans because they had nothing at Saks
I shop too there's no coming back
I got my foot on their neck
Damn I just blew through a check
I could come through in a jet
You know I do it the best

[Chorus]
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought

[Verse 2]
Giorgio Armani shirt
I'm in a truck not a vert
My bitch in a Versace skirt
My bitch is not going no flirt
I got Backwoods all flavors
You know I'm rolling up
I'm driving like Kentucky Derby
I park after cone on the curb
I'm probably in Off-White the most
You probably distracted by hoes
Two racks [?]
I got a white bitch and she play with her nose
Diamonds on top of my clothes
My left wrist froze
My inside it sound like its us
I fuck her from the back in the loft
I send her back home in a Lyft
No I'm no dropping her off
I buy you Herm√©s I know you like that
I spilled some Hi-Tec and then made it splash
I paint the car mat it used to be black
If you want a foreign car it costs a stack
When I'm in New York I meet on the track
When I'm at the airport I carry-on bag
[?] she got a blue Jag
I buy you some Louis Vuitton like it's nothing
I'm rocking some Gucci I'm treating it like nothing
I'm driving too fast, I'm lighting [?]
My bitch rocking Gucci she in a short [?}
I'm balling but that don't mean I'm shooting the threes

[Chorus]
I just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought everything Louis, everything Louis
Just bought

E-e-everything everything Louis
Everything everything Louis
