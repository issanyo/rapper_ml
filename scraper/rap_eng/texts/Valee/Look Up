[Intro]
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

[Chorus: Z Money]
Every time I look up, I’m ‘bout to do a cook up
Me and Bricc like black and [?], because we got the hook up
Hell no, can’t buy no gram, because they already shook up
I’m cashing out, no [?] up, not one mil, but I’m two up
Skrt, skrt, skrt, I made ‘em throw up, hop out, Louis from the shoe up
Lil bitch, she say I’m too much, I think my closet’s too much
My diamonds fucking blind ‘em, make a nigga wanna shoot us
Come fuck a ho, it’s two of us, my pockets filled with blue bucks

[Verse 1: Valee]
My Lambo don’t want no putt putt, it’s 6:30, I been up, up
I fuck ‘round, buy a pick up truck, then pick two bitches back up
They think it’s fun, I know that, I caught a flat, I towed that
It’s 6s on my broham, my bad, I thought you know that
They 6s and they run flat, these bitches kissing, run back
These bitches kissing, run back
My lean, it look like Cognac, this a Supersport, no Pontiac
I stopped and bought the fun pack, she said, “You brought the fun back”
My pockets look like thot pack, my t-shirt say VLONE
Don’t rock shoes ‘cause I rock slides, got Valentino on
My Cartiers, they handmade, my bitch’s purse is handmade
My two door coupe is hand sprayed, I smoke and dab the handshake

[Chorus: Z Money]
Every time I look up, I’m ‘bout to do a cook up
Me and Bricc like black and [?], because we got the hook up
Hell no, can’t buy no gram, because they already shook up
I’m cashing out, no [?] up, not one mil, but I’m two up
Skrt, skrt, skrt, I made ‘em throw up, hop out, Louis from the shoe up
Lil bitch, she say I’m too much, I think my closet’s too much
My diamonds fucking blind ‘em, make a nigga wanna shoot us
Come fuck a ho, it’s two of us, my pockets filled with blue bucks

[Verse 2: Z Money]
Get up and then let’s treat it, if I broke it [?]
60 dollars for the weekend, ride out dolo, niggas creeping
He done seen ‘em, I ain’t bleeding, [?] to our 26s
Please don’t ask me why I’m speeding, I make cash, now we not equal
Ask my [?], we be stunting on people, trap all year, invest all summer
I ain’t got 10 bands, text my gunner, that nigga broke, he got a deal
I got dope in my canister, I pulled up in a wagon wheel
Broke ass nigga, he acting stingy, now I know the accurate
These niggas ain’t trapping for real, it’s a wrap, I tell them chill
Boy, I’m wrapping packs for real, got 60 bands, I’m making a sale
Heroin talk, my blue [?] real, told my jeweller check me a scale
Watch these niggas, they pussy, gon’ tell, you can get rich, I know he is

[Chorus: Z Money]
Every time I look up, I’m ‘bout to do a cook up
Me and Bricc like black and [?], because we got the hook up
Hell no, can’t buy no gram, because they already shook up
I’m cashing out, no [?] up, not one mil, but I’m two up
Skrt, skrt, skrt, I made ‘em throw up, hop out, Louis from the shoe up
Lil bitch, she say I’m too much, I think my closet’s too much
My diamonds fucking blind ‘em, make a nigga wanna shoot us
Come fuck a ho, it’s two of us, my pockets filled with blue bucks

[Outro: Valee & Z Money]
My Lambo don’t want no putt putt, it’s 6:30, I been up, up
I fuck ‘round, buy a pick up truck, then pick two bitches back up
They think it’s fun, I know that, I caught a flat, I towed that
It’s 6s on my broham, my bad, I thought you know that
Every time I look up, I’m ‘bout to do a cook up
Me and Bricc like black and [?], because we got the hook up
Hell no, can’t buy no gram, because they already shook up
I’m cashing out, no [?] up, not one mil, but I’m two up
