The lean was fake, so I didn't want in
Needed sleep, so I popped two xans
Got two cars parked outside my crib
One was tight, couldn't get out the jam
One was white and the seats was tan
I got two hoes and they look like twins

[Verse
One was white but she had a tan
One was wife, yeah, she had a man
Fuck my check up on the first again
Bitch [?], it's a ice attack
Buying expensive shit, that's a price attack
Sushi rolls, I had rice with that
Bougie hoes, I be fucking that
Woah, Coogi clothes, I'm still wearing that
Gucci shoes, they just dropped these vintage
I just fuck these hoes and drive these bitches
Wash my coupe with what you wash your dishes
Balmain ripped, look like they shot these bitches
I got lean without the perscription
Bitch, you tripping, you too pessimistic
I just poured up in the purple misty
I'm getting paper without no subscription
Super Sport, I fucked up the transmission
Dropped it and then I fixed it
Probably soft, the ass on my bitch
Probably all above average and shit
Probably mad 'cause I'm having shit
OG Gas, this some Cali shit
OG Gas, this some Cali shit
Super Sport, I upgraded it
