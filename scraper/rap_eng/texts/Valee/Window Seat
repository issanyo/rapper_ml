[Hook]
Can I get a window seat?
Can I get a window seat?
A window seat
Can I get a window seat?

[Post-Hook]
I'ma go and get the guap and spend it on all kind of shit, that I want
I'ma go and get the guap and spend it on all kind of shit, that I want

[Verse 1]
My bitch is a fire, racks and I buy [?] like doors with you
26s, seven racks and I rolls doors like they was
Fucking bitches back to back, I drop 'em off, set them back free
My britches cost ten racks and they come from across the street
They ain't drop these yet, they cost a G
For some lean like this, it cost a fee
When I pour up, it's dark like coffee beans
Park my coupe all by itself

[Bridge]
Don't want nobody next to me
Don't want nobody next to me
Next to me
Don't want nobody next to me

[Hook]
Can I get a window seat?
Can I get a window seat?
A window seat
Can I get a window seat?

[Post-Hook]
I'ma go and get the guap and spend it on all kind of shit, that I want
I'ma go and get the guap and spend it on all kind of shit, that I want

[Verse 2]
I want floor seats, no nosebleeds
Shoes red like your nose bleed
Fogo de Chao your hoe
Throw ones, make pile on floor
I got stripper bitches dancing back to back
Yeah, now those some freaks, and I know
She gon' ask a nigga to buy her a new bag
And I know he will, but I won't
And I'm driving, rolling up the gas
Told my bitch to hold the wheel, 'cause I won't
It's 200 on my dash, I'ma do it
And I hope you heal, 'cause I won't

[Hook]
Can I get a window seat?
Can I get a window seat?
A window seat
Can I get a window seat?

[Post-Hook]
I'ma go and get the guap and spend it on all kind of shit, that I want
