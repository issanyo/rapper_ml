[Intro]
Rio
Uh
Rio Mac on the track

[Hook]
I got a bad bitch in heels
And she got on designer thrills
Let me know, have you seen her before?
Have you seen her before?
I got a bad bitch in heels
And she ride Forgiato wheels
Let me know, have you seen her before?
Have you seen her?

[Verse]
Have you seen her?
Mercedes Benz speakers, ooh woah
I got a bad bitch, just the kind you want
She got a big ass, see that from the front, yeah
And I
Took the Backwood and you know I stuffed it all, yeah
And I
I'm in the old school, topped it off, I'm snatching off

[Hook]
I got a bad bitch in heels
And she got on designer thrills
Let me know, have you seen her before?
Have you seen her before?
I got a bad bitch in heels
And she ride Forgiato wheels
Let me know, have you seen her before?
Have you seen her?

[Outro]
