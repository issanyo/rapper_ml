[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Brand new offset Forgiatos (pssh)
That's what got me dodgin' potholes (yeah)
I'm tryna keep up with Hermes (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got matching his and her meds (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I put the bitch in David Yurman (yeah)
In a 4 door the same color hummus
I'm pourin' Hi-Tech and you know it
My bitch rockin' Phillipp Plein (yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
I'm waitin' on you, loading (yeah)
I'm smokin' exotic, it's potent (yeah)
I'm in the exotic [?]
My Latino bitch call me "papi chulo"
I purchase Off-White for a popular ho
Might get her a brand new white Tesla 4-Door

[Verse]
I'm waitin' on you, loading
I'm sippin' mud, told ya
I pay you now so I won't owe you
On my left wrist it cold
Yves St. Laurent coat
I know you like how that shit sound
I got a old school, I like how it sound
Versace nightgown, I like how it sound
I fuck up the racks with a night on the town
I hope you don't run up, I'm firin' you down
I know you like how that shit sound
I'm fuckin' that bitch from the back right now
I'm in some Balmains, cost two racks right now

[Chorus]
Brand new offset Forgiatos
That's what got me dodgin' potholes
I'm tryna keep up with Hermes
Got matching his and her meds
I put the bitch in David Yurman
In a 4 door the same color hummus
I'm pourin' Hi-Tech and you know it
My bitch rockin' Phillipe plain

[Post-Chorus]
I'm waitin' on you, loading
I'm smokin' exotic, it's potent (yeah)
I'm in the exotic [?]
My Latino bitch call me "papi chulo"
I purchase Off-White for a popular ho
Might get her a brand new white Tesla 4-Door

[Outro]
I'm sippin' mud, told ya
I pay you now so I won't owe you
On my left wrist it cold
Yves St. Laurent coat
I'm waitin' on you, loading
I got a old school, I like how it sound
Versace nightgown, I like how it sound
I fuck up the racks with a night on the town
I hope you don't run up, I'm firin' you down
