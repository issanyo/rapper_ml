[Intro]
Chase the money, chase the money

[Chorus: Choir and Chance The Rapper]
Are you live? Lit? Loud?
Dirty clothes, hamper, trap, study
Fold, rock it, yuh, yuh
It's a Audi, zoom-zoom, ZZ's, nap
Hit it, stamp, lean, frap
Nasty, yeah, uh-oh, snap
Bagback, tap, bitch this slap
Handshake, what's that? Dap (dab)

[Verse 1: Valee, Jeremih, & Chance the Rapper]
Fuck with my 12's, Wisconsin Dells
What about you? Yeah, fucked a masseuse
Fuck that bitch and send her right back to you
Chunk up the deuce
Been pulled the trigger, I've been that nigga
Yeah, ooh, I'm with my lil' man, I'm with the zoo
With the wood in my ear, made the roof disappear
Fuck that bitch to Erykah Badu, hahahaha
Used to rock Havana Joe boots
I'm sorta boujee but I'm not a bitch
You got the goose but it's not a Givenchy
I swear, my palms, they be itching
You rocking braids, that shit is different
Be Versace, look through the shades
[?] in the kitchen
I mix the lean with apple juice
She off a bean, she wanna juke
She don't want water, she don't want food
Still no chaser? (Oooh)
Mexican booth, I bought some fruit
Elephant tooth
Look what I bought, regular suit
Grammy's, I'm smoking that Pep√© Le Pew

[Chorus]
Are you live? Lit? Loud?
Dirty clothes, hamper, trap, study
Fold, rock it, yuh, yuh
It's a Audi, zoom-zoom, ZZ's, nap
Hit it, stamp, lean, frap
Nasty, yeah, uh-oh, snap
Bagback, tap, bitch this slap
Handshake, what's that? dap (dab)

[Verse 2: Valee & Jeremih & Chance the Rapper]
At Mariano's, I got the pooch
I got the loot, eatin' good
At Mariano's, I got my pooch
I got the puppy, I got the pump
Thanks to the mailman, I got the dump
I hit a lick, didn't touch your tongue
I got blue huns, separate the ones
Take it to Chase, facin' a blunt
Fogo De Chao, that was for lunch
I'm tryna dunk, skip to my lou
Check in my bed, checkin' my suit
Fuck that bitch twice, that's deja vu
Fuck on a journalist, she want the scoop
Now she do the news
Black diamonds, I'm on my slopes
My baby need a new coat
I'ma slide to River Oaks
Auntie Annie's when I walk through the door
Magic picture, man I'm chargin' for photos
I need me some bread, I need me some bread
Niggas salty, man that's all they gon' throw
I need me some prez, preferably dead
Remember the block is hot
My Pioneer shake the block
Oh, a little bit off the top
Please Calvin, don't sell the shop
Ice cubes on my eggnog
Ms. Claus in them red draws
Shit, who do you think you are?
Bitch, you giving a TedTalk?

[Chorus]
Are you live? Lit? Loud?
Dirty clothes, hamper, trap, study
Fold, rock it, yuh, yuh
It's a Audi, zoom-zoom, ZZ's, nap
Hit it, stamp, lean, frap
Nasty, yeah, uh-oh, snap
Bagback, tap, bitch this slap
Handshake, what's that? dap (dab)
