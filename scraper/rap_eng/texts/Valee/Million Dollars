[Intro]
And this beat by ChaseTheMoney, he gon’ sell some dope with me

[Hook]
I just wanna fuck your bitch on a million dollars, aye
Stackin’ up the guap until I see a million dollars, aye
It’s a good girl, oh yeah, it’s a bomb bae
I had took the lean and I mixed it with some Bombay
Old school’s clean, I was showin’ that bitch off
Tappin’ on the gas, I was snatchin’ in it often
Old bitch was trippin’, I had told that bitch get lost
Waitin’ on my shipment, I don’t think that shit took off yet

[Verse]
Got the lean in the cup, I need some pop with that
In the loft, fucked your bitch in that
Balmain, gotta get the hand wash, rinse that
Racks don’t fold, I guess these different
New two door and it’s all tinted
Molly rock, it made you dance, didn’t it
New bitch racist, gotta get a million dollars
I just bought some pink molly rock for fifty dollars
Gave my bitch 200, sent her to the beauty parlor
Bitch was suckin’ on my dick so good, I felt her tonsils
I just paid the club to wipe the coupe for fifty dollars
I just got this new hoe number, but I didn’t call her

[Hook]
I just wanna fuck your bitch on a million dollars, aye
Stackin’ up the guap until I see a million dollars, aye
It’s a good girl, oh yeah, it’s a bomb bae
I had took the lean and I mixed it with some Bombay
Old school’s clean, I was showin’ that bitch off
Tappin’ on the gas, I was snatchin’ in it often
Old bitch was trippin’, I had told that bitch get lost
Waitin’ on my shipment, I don’t think that shit took off yet
