[Intro]
Hustle Squad
Two door, I’m back at it in traffic, I tapped it, didn’t snatch it
Rio Mac on the track
Hahaha

[Hook]
Two door, I’m back at it in traffic, I tapped it, didn’t snatch it
I got the pistol, oh, it’s ratchet, I blast it, you nappin’
I got your bitch with me, she nasty, I smashed it, you askin’
I got this lean with me, it’s clean, this shit gon’ have you nappin’

[Post-Hook]
Checkin’ for a bitch like I walked in the candy store
I had stopped and got a fill up at the Texaco
I had stuffed the OG in the ‘Wood and smoked it though
Mixin’ lean with ginger ale, but I’m not sleepy though

[Verse]
Back to back, SS, one was white, I changed it back to black
I hit Saks fucked up, ten racks, it went back to stack fuckin’ racks
Might tax you if you askin’ for a feature off the bat
I was in Miami, fuckin’ up a couple racks
Thick bitch, real skinny, only her booty fat
White ‘Rari, all white, only the tires black
Buyin’ shit from everywhere, none of my designer match
Bitch want me to lay with her, but I ain’t got no time for that

[Hook]
