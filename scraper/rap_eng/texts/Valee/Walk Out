[Intro]
H-h-hey, McCoy
I get my work from the Narco

[Chorus: MATT OX]
Walk out, Gucci, walk in, Louis
Walk out Gucci, it's racks on my feet
Walk in Louis, it’s racks on my jeans
I'ma ball with the ball, I just ball with the green
Can't stop buyin’ the mall, man, I feel like a fiend

[Verse 1: Matt Ox]
Check look like a pretty penny (Like a pretty penny)
Neck broke, chain was too heavy (It was too heavy)
Tryna chase the clout, you boys is too petty (You is too petty)
I'm tryna chase a mil', I need all the fetty (All the fetty)
You not my slime, my boys are way too slimy (Slatt, slatt)
Get a bag, I heard you already 30 (Yeah)
And it's so sad (What), ‘cause I already what you ain't earnin' (Uh huh)
Started to stack (Yuh), when my mama stopped giving' me money (Yeah)
Stopped doin' allowance ‘cause that was lil’ cash to me (Yeah)

[Chorus: Matt Ox]
Walk out (Walk), Gucci (Walk), walk in (Walk), Louis (Walk)
Walk out Gucci, it’s racks on my feet (Feet)
Walk in Louis it's racks on my jeans (Jeans)
I’ma ball with the ball, I just ball with the green (Green)
Can't stop buyin' the mall, man, I feel like a fiend (Fiend)

[Verse 2: Valee]
I'm in Louis Vuitton, that’s two different browns
My exotic sound like it's two different sounds
I might put that bitch in a Versace gown
I spent 7,000, it's Ricks on my trousers
I put thirteen racks in my motor, it's louder
It's ice on my t-shirt, but not from the ice chills
I don't got no Wi-Fi, I'm still servin' Hi-Tech
I painted my photo and took off the labels
My other bitch spun like I'm John Leguizamo
I'm in a Chevy, bitch, but it's not a Lawndale
My Balmain look like I bought these from a yard sale
My driver's seat back like I'm sittin' in a lounge
My bitch stomach flat like it keep losin' pounds
I got two apartments, that's two different nouns
I'm in David Yurman, cost 800 pounds
I swim in my bitches, but I never drown
I'm rockin' Yves St. Laurent coat like first down

[Chorus: MATT OX]
Walk out (Walk), Gucci (Walk), walk in (Walk), Louis (Walk)
Walk out Gucci, it's racks on my feet (Feet)
Walk in Louis it's racks on my jeans (Jeans)
I'ma ball with the ball, I just ball with the green (Green)
Can't stop buyin' the mall, man, I feel like a fiend (Fiend)
