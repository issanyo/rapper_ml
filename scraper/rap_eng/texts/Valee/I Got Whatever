[Intro]
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

[Chorus]
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got, I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got, I got whatever

[Verse]
I'm clever, my bitch bad, she can't get no better
My engine it runnin' and revvin' forever
Whenever I'm usin' the clutch and the pedal
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I'll fuck her however, whenever, wherever, forever
I keep the pistol for whoever, whenever, whichever
Endeavor, encounter, if ever
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got, I got whatever (I got whatever)
These Maison Margielas, you jealous, pull up in a Tesla
Whenever, however, no matter the weather
I fucked up a sixty, I could bought a bezel
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I picked up more lean and codeine, almost poured the whole thing
I walked inside, bought a designer sweater for fourteen
Stop by your trap and I'll pick up the package, the whole thing
The bitch on my lap, you run up, I get rid of the whole thing

[Chorus]
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got, I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got whatever (I got whatever)
I got whatever (I got whatever)
