[Intro: Valee]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Valee]
That sh** awesome
I got offsets, clean 'em off with awesome
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
I got some white b******, they say “Awesome”
Drive that coupe real awesome
Switchin’ lanes and swervin’ cause I’m awesome
N**** run up, I might off him
Had some autos on, I had to off 'em
She got Prada on and I don’t want her
Why you walkin’?
You was talkin’ s***, b****, now you walkin’
Why you talking?
You was talkin’ s***, b****, now you
Now you stalkin’

[Verse 1: Valee]
I don’t got no Trackhawk, but my shit hawkin'
F*** the police, I already lost ‘em
This ain’t Zinfandels but my shit frosty
I'm off lean and ginger ale so my s*** glossy
90 thousand what a new wrist costing
Br-brand new b**** and she callin' me dad
My credit score ain't the only thing bad
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Valee]
N****, that s*** awesome
I got offsets, clean 'em off with awesome
I got some white b******, they say “Awesome”
Drive that coupe real awesome
Switchin’ lanes and swervin’ cause I’m awesome
N**** run up, I might off him
Had some autos on, I had to off 'em
She got Prada on and I don’t want her
Why you walkin’?
You was talkin’ s***, b****, now you walkin’
Why you talking?
You was talkin’ s***, b****, now you
Now you stalkin’

[Verse 2: Matt OX]
Our Gucci flowers blossom
And you still can't cost 'em
I been eatin' tropic food, you still eatin' lobster
Look at me, you can't stop us
Pssh, and the cops done lost us
Designer been drippin' off us
You lookin' like "What it cost us?"
My bling in that rain
Takin' a train, now we got Ranges
Remember checkin' my bank
For some change, now things changing
Walk in like get naked, ain't got patience
Yes, go change it
All that money, flexin', cars is rented
Don't you faze me
Don't hang with lots of rappers
Swear that they act like they're strangers
Walked down Gucci stores
Then I had to go and change it
Off-White yellow tape it
Gucci lace it
Louis V cases
Don't care if I break it
The cop can't trace this

[Outro: Matt OX]
The cops can't trace this
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
And the cops done lost us
Designer been drippin' off us
You lookin' like "What it cost 'em?"
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
