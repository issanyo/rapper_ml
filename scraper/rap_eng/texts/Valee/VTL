[Intro]
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
And this beat by ChaseTheMoney, he gon' sell some dope with me
ChaseTheMoney
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

[Verse 1]
Say you got a bitch, but you don't know where she the hell at
I might take like 20 thousand and go buy a Hellcat
Lookin' for my shoes in Gucci, they gon' tell you they don't sell that
You the type to look around and see where they on sale at
I got three pints of lean, but I ain't check my Auntie mail yet
I tried to leave 4 zips, she said, "Uh uh, your Unc gon' smell that"
I told my Ma' don't keep her shotgun too far 'way from where the Shell's at
I got a bad bitch in Wisconsin, not too far from where the Dells at

[Chorus]
Stacks, racks, bitch, I went Saks Fifth shopping
Police pulled over me and I switched topics
Bad bitch with a booty and I didn't crop it
Ben Frank walk up on me, started crip walking

[Verse 2]
I was in Miami on Jefferson where that Shell at
White Ferrari, I hit the button, the roof had fell back
Took a trip to St. Louis, pulled up, where STL at
OG Gas so loud, it sounded like we getting yelled at
I'm so fuckin' good with guap but math the only class I failed at
I paid 200 for some socks and I don't know where they the hell at
Did some pretty fucked up stuff, I don't know why I ain't in hell yet
I bought my bitch a Yorkie Pup and she ain't even clip her nails yet
