Cole Haan, uh, uh, I hop out rockin' Margielas (Margielas)

$16000, I done went, bought me a Chevy (Chevy)

[Verse]
Maison Margielas, I just spent some old money (guap)
Stack it up too fast, I hit your trap with throwed money (money)
Bring it back too quick, I probably let you hold something (hold it)
Old bitch trippin', talkin' 'bout, "Let me hold something" (no)
QP of OG, I might let you owe something (new)
Hit the gas station and I left the motor runnin' (runnin')
OG Gas flavors once I get this blunt burnin' (lit)
Let the coupe snatch off once I got these wheels turnin' (turnin')

Dirty ass Fanta, it's $400 if I sell it (sell it)
Whole thing, I'ma pay for shipping if you mail it (mail it)

Cole Haan, uh, uh, I hop out rockin' Margielas (Margielas)
Dirty ass Fanta, it's $400 if I sell it (sell it)
