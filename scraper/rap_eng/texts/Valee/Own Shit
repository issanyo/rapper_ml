[Intro]
Smoke my own shit
My own

[Hook]
'Bout to start my own shit
I got tired of buying dope, I'm 'bout to grow my own shit
I got tired of fucking hoes, I'm 'bout to fuck my old bitch
I got Backwoods from the store, I'm 'bout to roll my own shit

[Post-Hook]
'Bout to start my own shit
Seen a bad bitch in the lobby, 'bout to see what room she in
I got OG and this loud, I know you smell it, you don't see it
And my odour from a half a mile away, you smell it, you don't see it

[Verse]
And my motor from a  half a mile away, you hear it, you don't see it
Think I'll get my own shit
I got tired of buying Balmains, I think I'll make my own shit
You on that acting wrong shit
I got something in my trunk that probably get you right quick
I'm in STORY in Miami
It's a group of Asian bitches tryna see what section we in
I spent six racks on 26s
Put 'em in the trunk and left 'em, I'm 'bout to mount my own shit

[Hook]
'Bout to start my own shit
I got tired of buying dope, I'm 'bout to grow my own shit
I got tired of fucking hoes, I'm 'bout to fuck my old bitch
I got Backwoods from the store, I'm 'bout to roll my own shit

[Post-Hook]
'Bout to start my own shit
Seen a bad bitch in the lobby, 'bout to see what room she in
I got OG and this loud, I know you smell it, you don't see it
And my odour from a half a mile away, you smell it, you don't see it

[Outro]
Bought codeine and it wasn't hit
I'm 'bout to pour it in my double cup and sip my own shit
