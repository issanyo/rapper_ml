[Intro]
New spot, new apartment, fuckin’ bitches raw in that
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney

[Pre-Chorus]
Come out on the trap shit
Got me talkin’ ‘bout all the trap shit
New spot, new apartment, fuckin’ bitches raw in that

[Chorus]
New spot, new apartment, fuckin’ bitches raw in that
Told a bitch to bring it back (bring that right back)
Like a return policy, she brought it back
I’m buyin’ designer shit like this (and it’s like this)
You bought designer, took it back
I’m fuckin’ bitches from the back (yeah, I did)
I told my bitch go get the sack (and she did)
I told my bitch go get the sack

[Verse]
You thought you was ballin’, where the fuck your ball at?
Where the fuck the mall at?
I shop online, I don’t need need no target (no target)
Let my motor coupe off, pop my hood (no, not yet)
Talkin’ ‘bout takin’ over blocks, not my hood (not on my block)
Stash spot, took apartments, police never checkin’ that (not checkin’ that)
I got two hoes, both stupid, had to keep them separate (separate)
Balmain, bought those, didn’t wear them, that’s neglect (where that at?)
Finesse slut, then I had mopped that (now that was wet)
Run that back

[Chorus]
New spot, new apartment, fuckin’ bitches raw in that (raw)
Told a bitch to bring it back (bring that right back)
Like a return policy, she brought it back (naw)
I’m buyin’ designer shit like this (and it’s like this)
You bought designer, took it back (aw)
I’m fuckin’ bitches from the back (just like that)
I told my bitch go get the sack (go get that sack)
I told my bitch go get the sack

[Outro]
New spot, new apartment, fuckin’ bitches raw in that (raw)
Raw just like that
Come out on the trap shit
Got me talkin’ ‘bout all the trap shit
New spot, new apartment, fuckin’ bitches raw in that (raw)
