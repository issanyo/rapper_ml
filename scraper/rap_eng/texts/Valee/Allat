[Intro]
$400 on my bitch Carmex
Hundred racks and I'm runnin' through all that
I want a new Vette, I'm not lookin' at Carmax
Huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah
Aw, yeah, Ty Made It
I want a new Vette, I'm not lookin' at Carmax
I got racks in my skinnies, you already knew that (huh, huh)
I want a new Vette, I'm not lookin' at Carmax (want a new Vette, huh)
Spent $500 on exotic Carmex
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh

[Chorus]
All of that, all of that, all of that, all that
All of that, all of that, all of that, all that
All of that, all of that, all of that, all that
Hundred racks and I'm runnin' through all that
(Pullin' up, Balenci' sneakers and all that)
All of that, all of that, all of that, all that
Got a bad bitch with a halo and all that
(She got a a halo and all of that)

[Verse]
I got rich hoes, they doin' Quaaludes and all that
(I got rich hoes and all that)
I hit from the back, she like opioids and all that
(I hit from the back, she like opioids)
I pull up like Cam'ron, O Boy, and all that
(I pull up like Cam'ron, O Boy, and all that)
We hittin' my phone, I'm tryna see where y'all at
I'm ballin', but it ain't nobody to call that
(I'm ballin', but it ain't nobody to call that)
I'm posted like a flyer on where the wall at
(I'm posted like a flyer on the wall)
I'm shoppin' online, I don't know where the mall at
Yeah, I got that bitch on me, I shoot 'til it's empty
Yeah, brand new Balmains, look like I forgot to rinse, yeah
My ex tryna fuck, she givin' me hints
I spent thirteen hundred on some skinny jeans
My AllSaints Pico look like Billie Jean
I play Project Pat, it could be Ghetty Green
I got her on offroad like a ATV
The only thing I know is I'm finna leave
Yeah, I get it on my own, I don't play the lotto
I'm in some high fashion, I'm shoppin' with Gado
And I want a new whip, but I don't want the car note
I fucked up my Jeep, I fixed it with Bondo
She told me I'm handsome, I tell her, "Yeah, I know"
I want some new feet, I might get Vellanos
