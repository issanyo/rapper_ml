[Hook]
My car so fast
I'm gon' fly right past you (cash, cash)
My bitch so bad
And got a fat ass too (a fat ass)
I like rubber bands
I don't want my cash loose (don't my cash loose)
Blue faces
I just like my cash blue (like my cash blue)

[Verse]
Check me out, bad bitch
Front seat, slut piece
Make it out, paper out
Paper route, vapour loud
Backwood, OG gas
4 grams, that about
Santan, pink molly
Small rock, nice amount
Fast ass 4 wheeler, dirt bike
Bought it out, race it out
Runnin' from the police
Made it out, Supersport
Stick shift, start it up
Shakin' now, that my bitch
Ass thick, pokin' out

Blue faces
I just like my cash blue (like my cash blue)

[Outro]
Cash
A fat ass
Don't my cash loose
Like my cash blue
