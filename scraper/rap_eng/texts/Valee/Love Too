[Intro]
Have you ever fucked these bitches back to back, lookin’ for the one who love you

[Chorus]
If you could stack your guap to the motherfuckin’ ceiling, I bet you’d love to
Have you ever fucked these bitches back to back, lookin’ for the one who love you?
Cocaine coupe, that’s a two door, strappin’ back, will I bust you? Bitch, I’d love to
At the light next to 12, smokin’ pack, took off on ‘em ‘cause I love to

[Verse]
I got my own agenda, I pour the 4 up in it
My bankroll, ain’t no bendin’
Supersport and it kickin’, can’t see in ‘cause it’s tinted
That ain’t yours ‘cause it’s rented
My neck and wrist is ignant, I spent the sack on Fendi
Like that shit ain’t expensive
This shoes Madison Margielas, my bitch can’t get no better
She made these bitches jealous

[Chorus]
If you could stack your guap to the motherfuckin’ ceiling, I bet you’d love to
Have you ever fucked these bitches back to back, lookin’ for the one who love you?
Cocaine coupe, that’s a two door, strappin’ back, will I bust you? Bitch, I’d love to
At the light next to 12, smokin’ pack, took off on ‘em ‘cause I love to
