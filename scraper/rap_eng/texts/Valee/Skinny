[Chorus]
I threw 60 racks and it came back
I was gettin' some neck from a nat, gave her brain back
Please don't ask me if I'm done with your bitch, no not yet
Thirteen racks on new Yves St. Laurent, look like I made that
I got 20 racks stuffed inside my fuckin' skinnies, bitch
Fuck that ratch, you are nothin' but another skinny bitch
I got 20 racks for a new sadity bitch
20 racks in my mothafuckin' skinnies, bitch

[Verse]
Still off that codeine, I ain't piss yet
I got 26s, where the bottom of my whip at?
And my mothafuckin' bitch a redhead
Yellow bone, bitch, yeah, walk around in somethin' red then
I just paid 2 thousand for some Christian Lou', not knockoff
Waitin' on plug to pull up with that Actavis, not knockoff
Better not pull up with that fuckin' Hi-Tech shit, not at all
I just pushed up in some new designer shit, not from the mall

[Chorus]
I threw 60 racks and it came back
I was gettin' some neck from a nat, gave her brain back
Please don't ask me if I'm done with your bitch, no not yet
Thirteen racks on new Yves St. Laurent, look like I made that
I got 20 racks stuffed inside my fuckin' skinnies, bitch
Fuck that ratch, you are nothin' but another skinny bitch
I got 20 racks for a new sadity bitch
20 racks in my mothafuckin' skinnies, bitch

[Outro]
Still off that codeine, I ain't piss yet
I got 26s, where the bottom of my whip at?
