[Chorus]
Might catch me out in Vlone, mhm
You broke? Mhm, leave me 'lone, mhm
That Super Sport, I still own, mhm
It's broke, mhm, it's at home, mhm

[Verse]
These... these are vintage jeans, uh huh
Rockin' Gucci, that's expensive feet, uh huh
That knockoff lean, that shit not for me, uh uh
Fuck that bitch and give her back like she not fit for me, uh uh

[Chorus]
Might catch me out in Vlone, mhm
You broke? Mhm, leave me 'lone, mhm
That Super Sport, I still own, mhm
It's broke, mhm, it's at home, mhm

[Outro]
These... these are vintage jeans, uh huh
Rockin' Gucci, that's expensive feet, uh huh
