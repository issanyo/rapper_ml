[Intro: Valee']
Rio
Now we can talk some shit
ChaseTheMoney! ChaseTheMoney!
Now we can talk some shit (damn!)
Now we can talk some shit (Z Money)
Now we can talk some shit

[Verse 1: Z Money]
Just ate a box of poptarts, drunk and fucked up off this wockhardt
Beat it down, now rerock it, the kitchen smell like fart fart
Sellin' blow on Lowlist got me hustlin' in my Carhartt
Lil' bitch don't make my dick hard
I really don't wanna pay y'all
Got killas just like Adolf
I'm workin', cannot layoff
I swear this shit gon' pay off (True)
Hit out the park like "he gone"
Z-Money make the playoffs
Talkin' bout them bricks on each song
I hurt his feelings, he wrong
I'm a dope boy got my beep on
Mercedes what I see most
Smokin' big bongs just like Cheech Chong
I came in with my heat on

[Break: Valee']
Now we can talk some shit

[Verse 2: Valee']
Y'ves Saint Laurent bookbag on my back
Don't look back, crack the roof back
Shop at Fogo de Chao, bitch, not Outback
'Sace foot slides, matte black
Fashion, peacoat cost 12, 13
Small block, out back, plastic dip coupe
No clear coat, use my phone, start that
Bitch start fussin', I'm like 'ho, don't start that'
Super sport with frog eyes
Doubleparked at Five Guys
Hope you don't run up, bitch, I'll toe-tag you
Shoot you five times, Christian Louboutins sneaks
Five racks, lean was gone, refill that
Flow mad sticky, spill that
Louis Vuitton print wallet hanging
From my garment, by cuban link

[Outro: Valee']
Now we can talk some shit
Now we can talk some shit
Now we can talk some shit
