[Intro]
On my, on my third deuce and I'm drinkin' out the fountain
On my, on my third deuce
On my, on my third deuce and I'm drinkin' out the fountain
Thousand dollar jeans, got my britches half-assed, yeah

[Break]
Really, really
Really, really
Really, really
Really

[Hook]
Really, really splashin' lean, got me swervin', I ain't crashin'
I don't want the bitch if them ain't her eyelashes
California 'Rarri and it got the tires ashin'
Bal, Balmain, probably, and these bitches high fashion
Coupe, coupe the color coke, it got the [?] scratchin'
Supersport quick, I had the safety belt fashioned
Countin' up this money, I could do this shit backwards
Percocet 10, got them bitches hot flashin'

[Verse]
On my, on my third deuce and I'm drinkin' out the fountain
Thousand dollar jeans, got my britches half-assed, yeah
Hoe from overseas and them bitches high fashion
Olive green Yeezy and them bitches high fashion
Walk, walked in Saks Fifth and I picked out some high fashion
Shit, hoe get on my nerves, I'ma give her right back
Fucked your main bitch and I gave her right back
Christian Loubouton with the spike a whole stack
Say you hittin' licks, I can see straight cashin', aye
Say you ain't legit, I can see you straight flexin', aye
Went to Ruth Chris, told the waitress bring the check, aye
Bitches in the loft and they walk around naked

[Hook]
Really, really splashin' lean, got me swervin', I ain't crashin'
I don't want the bitch if them ain't her eyelashes
California 'Rarri and it got the tires ashin'
Bal, Balmain, probably, and these bitches high fashion
Coupe, coupe the color coke, it got the [?] scratchin'
Supersport quick, I had the safety belt fashioned
Countin' up this money, I could do this shit backwards
Percocet 10, got them bitches hot flashin'

[Outro]
Got them bitches hot flashin'
Supersport quick, I had the safety belt fashioned
