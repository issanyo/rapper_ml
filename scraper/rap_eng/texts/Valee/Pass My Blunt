[Chorus}
I don't even pass my blunt no more
If you don't give me what I ask
When I ask for the shit stupid bitch
I dont want it no more
Goofy nigga think he tough put a nigga on his ass
Bet the nigga dont stunt no more
Bet the nigga dont front no more
Got a bag in a bag
Yo bitch outta tags, these bitches dont want no smoke
I don't even pass my blunt no more
(I don't even pass my blunt no more)
I don't even pass my blunt no more
(I don't even pass my blunt no more)
Bitch, I don't even pass my blunt no more
(I don't even pass my blunt no more)
I don´t even pass my blunt no more
(I don´t even pass my blunt no more)

[Verse: Queen Key}

Look bitch, I dont even think we ever fucked when I was sober
Bitches look up to me and they older
Boy, ain't another bitch colder
Yo bitch so pop, got the soda in her
If he a cop, I dont know the nigga
She might get dropped cause she roll with niggas
Bitch you know me, I expose these niggas
And they dont never do shit casue they know
These house want orgies, but they can't afford key
(They can't afford key)
These hoes want more of key
But they is too boring
Bitch I get booked like im touring
Aye, get the head all night, kick you out in the morning
Aye, please stop all that snoring
Aye, I put the ignore in ignoring
These niggas informants
That bitch wanna see, bitch where is your warrant
I think im enormous, he drinking im pouring
Wonder how I do it, they curious georging


[Chorus}
I don't even pass my blunt no more
If you don't give me what I ask
When I ask for the shit stupid bitch
I dont want it no more
Goofy nigga think he tough put a nigga on his ass
Bet the nigga dont stunt no more
Bet the nigga dont front no more
Got a bag in a bag
Yo bitch outta tags, these bitches dont want no smoke
I don't even pass my blunt no more
(I don't even pass my blunt no more)
I don't even pass my blunt no more
(I don't even pass my blunt no more)
Bitch, I don't even pass my blunt no more
(I don't even pass my blunt no more)

[Verse: Valee}

I don't even pass my blunt no more
Balmain 3 racks, that ain't come from the store
3 or 4 percocets, 30´s they gone
I don't even beep her at lunch no more
Fucked that bitch twice, I ain't want her no more
[?] and ill park by the door
Pull up on you in a foreign too though
I pulled an 8, I ain't want no more
Cash out on BAPE and that´s for my hoe
Fresh ass fit, what I pay for it? 4 racks
My bitch at home and she yellow like bodak
80 racks on ice, i'm flashing like kodak
Talk shit I leave you right where you fucked up at
I got them rats coming in like a mustache
You get caught up, you don't tell popo
Im at the gas station [?]
I dont even want the super sport no more
Dont act a bitch, ill curve you though
I dont even fuck with my aunt no more
In atlanta with a [?] though
I bought some dope and I smoked it
Not for sale meaning it sat there
Im in yo bitch like a pap smear
Run up on me, you gone rest there


[Chorus}
I don't even pass my blunt no more
If you don't give me what I ask
When I ask for the shit stupid bitch
I dont want it no more
Goofy nigga think he tough put a nigga on his ass
Bet the nigga dont stunt no more
Bet the nigga dont front no more
Got a bag in a bag
Yo bitch outta tags, these bitches dont want no smoke
I don't even pass my blunt no more
(I don't even pass my blunt no more)
I don't even pass my blunt no more
(I don't even pass my blunt no more)
Bitch, I don't even pass my blunt no more
(I don't even pass my blunt no more)
I don´t even pass my blunt no more
(I don't even pass my blunt no more)
