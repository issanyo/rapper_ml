[Hook]
Pulled up to Saks Fifth, walked in, and then
Spent 10, spent 10, spent 10, and then
Walked right back to the coupe, hopped in, and then (skr)
Took off quick, snatched off with your bitch, and then

[Post-Hook]
I spent 10 (I spent it)
I spent 10 (I spent it)

I spent 10, 10 (I spent it, I spent it)

[Verse]
I fucked up a 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 (I spent it)
Bad bitch ain't from here, but she shop for foreign with me (shop)
Talkin' 'bout your lean clean, I know he lied, didn't he (lied)
Bought this bitch a [?] to hold a 9 in it (9)
Two racks on Balmain jeans and on my ass Fendi
Bought my kid designer shit, yeah, on his thighs Gucci (I spent it)
Took this bitch to Chinatown and got some dry sushi (sushi)
Old school too quick, I tap this bitch, it drive stupid
Niggas talk too much, you know the feds is all listenin' (watchin')
I just valet parked and pulled up with all bitches (bitches)
Fucked up 7 racks and I bought me 4 trenches (trenches)
Fucked her from the back and I quit in 10 minutes

Parked it in the yard, clean the car with dish liquid
Room at the Ritz, yeah, I got your bitch missin'
Hoes on the bed doin' more than french kissin'
Toes on me red, then she caught me, 10:50
I spent it, I spent it, I spent it
I spent it, I spent it, I spent it
I spent it, I spent it, I spent it
Poured up the meds, sell this shit for $6.50
Pole on me scared, they can shoot 'til it's empty
I spent it, I spent it, I spent it

I spent it, I spent it, I spent it
