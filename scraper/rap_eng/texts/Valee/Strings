[Hook]
Strings, strings
I pull a whole lot of strings
I did a whole lot of things
I drive the car like it got wings
I got the codeine, it's clean
Strings, strings
You treat a ho like a queen
I treat the bitch like a fiend
She call my phone and it rings
Ring, ring
Ring, ring
Ring, ring
You treat a ho like a queen
I treat the bitch like a fiend
She call my phone and it rings
I pull a whole lot of strings

[Verse]
I get some drip from the store
I want a whole lot of cheese
I just wan' pipe down your ho
We did a whole lot of things
And I just poured me a 4
I stack two cups case it leak
I got a stack on my feet
And that bitch always unique
I had you back on your feet
Two pistol, line up the sheets
I'm 'bout to eat with a Greek
You should've seen the receipt
I put Gucci on GG
I mix the lean with Fiji
You want a lot of OG
I pull a whole lot of strings

[Hook]
Strings, strings
I pull a whole lot of strings
I did a whole lot of things
I drive the car like it got wings
I got the codeine, it's clean
Strings, strings
You treat a ho like a queen
I treat the bitch like a fiend
She call my phone and it rings
Ring, ring
Ring, ring
Ring, ring
You treat a ho like a queen
I treat the bitch like a fiend
She call my phone and it rings
I pull a whole lot of strings
