[Intro]
Rio Mac on the track

[Chorus]
Just, just in case the coupe is kind of slow
I added some more horses to the pack
Just in case I leave without the pole
I got one in the car, it's in the back
I walked up to the bar and spent a stack
I looked at my bitch ass and it was fat
She said instead of Xans, she wanted flats
She doin' it with no hands, now look at that

[Verse]
I popped a Xan because I needed rest
I bought a treadmill 'cause I don't flex
Just in case this rappin' won't work
I'll start a restaurant with a check
I, I just let a blonde give me neck
Bought a pistol for my mom for some protection
I might buy some Balmains and neglect 'em
I threw a bitch some ones and she fetched 'em

[Chorus]
Just, just in case the coupe is kind of slow
I added some more horses to the pack
Just in case I leave without the pole
I got one in the car, it's in the back
I walked up to the bar and spent a stack
I looked at my bitch ass and it was fat
She said instead of Xans, she wanted flats
She doin' it with no hands, now look at that
