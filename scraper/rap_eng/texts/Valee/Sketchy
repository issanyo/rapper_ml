[Intro]
Sketchy
Pull up

[Pre-Hook]
Brand new whip with the stash spot
Class and convenient, Gucci, bought that
All on my outfit, shipped it, to me
I want the 6s, new bitch, too thick
I want the bitches, topless, just like my coupe is
New whip, mount it, just like my boo is
New heels, pick up my new ho
To fuck, new feel, two pints, two sips
Two doors, two sticks

[Hook]
Did that 'cause I was sketchy
Don't go there 'cause it's sketchy
And I did, that was sketchy
They gon' think that was sketchy
Did that 'cause I was sketchy (yeah)
Pull up on her, she ready (yeah, pull up)
Throw that ass, I'ma catch it
It was my dog, I left him

Brand new bitch and she bad, yeah

Do she, rock the, Louis, Fendi?
Tripping 'cause I fuck other bitches
New whip, too quick, fucked her, fixed it
Options, just like my roof is, oh yeah
One wipe, just like my tooth is, switch gear
Drop off your main, to fuck, done deal
Scrapped off, picked up my new diamond necklace
Diamond clip just like Effen
Fucked a ho, that was messy
Yeah, messy, yeah
