[Intro]
I been up two days
I been up two days, no sleep
Rio Mac on the track
Been up two days, no sleep

[Chorus]
I been up two days, no sleep
I'm stuffin' four grams of OG
I pour a whole eighth of codeine
I make it four ways in one week
You know this coupe cost a four piece
I flex, jet skis on the ocean

[Post-Chorus]
My bitch is bougie, aye
Margiela shoelace
Coupe snatchin' in place
I stack a blue face
I been up two days with no sleep
It's in the suitcase
I drank a whole eighth of codeine

[Verse]
I marry blue face
It caught the bouquet
I'm drinkin' D'USSÃ‰
Ten racks on 2K
[?] schemin' Kool Aid
Two door in two lanes
Two ho in Dolce
She from the Ukraine
She my lil cute thang
She role a whole zip of OG, yeah
I take a bitch with me OT, yeah
Car, man, start up with no key, yeah
Walk into Blue Flame
Pull up in that new thang
Paint look like cocaine
Look like I hopped out a airplane
All in Miami at Manolo kickin' it, Liu Kang
These bitches act like they know me
I fuck up loose change
I'm playin' Wu-Tang
I do what you can't
She my lil boo thang
I make her roll up the whole thang

[Chorus]
I been up two days, no sleep
I'm stuffin' four grams of OG
I pour a whole eighth of codeine
I make it four ways in one week
You know this coupe cost a four piece
I flex, jet skis on the ocean

[Post-Chorus]
My bitch is bougie, aye
Margiela shoelace
Coupe snatchin' in place
I stack a blue face
I been up two days with no sleep
It's in the suitcase
I drank a whole eighth of codeine
