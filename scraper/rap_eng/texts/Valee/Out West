[Intro]
Rio

[Chorus: Valee]
60 racks, is it enough to go and get the two door coupe? Not yet
You ain't gotta ask me and my niggas if we had tried, our best
I got 16 racks all inside my Balmain, out west
I got a two door coupe parked on my descent, out west

[Verse 1: KD Young Cocky]
I been trappin' since a jit, my out west ho been hittin' licks
I stopped ridin' with the stick, ho, my diamonds just took a piss
A-Town with the killers, I go home just to go and get the zip
Your girlfriend a thirsty bitch, I might just give her a sip
Ooh, ooh, what's that drip, new Margielas on my kicks
Bust through ridin', I'm a pimp, I might juug walk with a limp
Goin' ape, you just a chimp, aye, aye
I do say myself whenever I want a drink, aye, aye, aye
I smoke Backwoods, fuck your Swisher Sweets, aye, aye
I be G, aye, out west with your freak, aye
Geekin' off OG, aye, we parked on your street, aye
I made it my block, made it from the bottom to the top, aye

[Chorus: Valee]
60 racks, is it enough to go and get the two door coupe? Not yet
You ain't gotta ask me and my niggas if we had tried, our best
I got 16 racks all inside my Balmain, out west
I got a two door coupe parked on my descent, out west

[Verse 2: Mikey Dollaz]
I be fuckin' more hoes than I can handle
I'm on fire like a motherfuckin' candle
Your bitch say she wanna ride me like a Lambo
Bitch, I got it, I'ma treat it like Rambo
Just like KD, bitch, I'm cocky, your bitch give me sloppy
I get money like monopoly, bitch, my ears is rocky
I'm that nigga, plus I'm fat, that's why these bitches watch me
And all the Puerto Rican hoes call a nigga papi
I make money when I'm bored, and I might cop a foreign
I'm like Valee when I'm tourin', all these bitches borin'
Mikey Dollaz 'bout a dolla, all them niggas mourn
Put work out west, I got niggas [?]

[Chorus: Valee]
60 racks, is it enough to go and get the two door coupe? Not yet
You ain't gotta ask me and my niggas if we had tried, our best
I got 16 racks all inside my Balmain, out west
I got a two door coupe parked on my descent, out west
