[Intro]
I wake up
I wake up did what I want
I wake up

[Hook]
I wake up did what I want
I had to get what I could
My lil hoe suck me too good
My coupe the color of that raw
OG gas come straight from Cali
I spend that cheddar like I bought
I walk right into the store
Pick out whatever I want
I want my engine in back
I'm out here chasin' a sack
Ain't nothin' get in my way
I'm out here smokin' that pack
I ain't out here chasin' these skeezers
They bite off the hand that it feed 'em
You out here finessin' your plug
Fuck 'round you know you gon' need him
I wake up did what I want

[Verse 1]
I spent 6 thou on some wheels
I could have bought me a bike
You know my bitches like hoes
They only fuck with them dykes
My partner play with that raw
No Pyrex pot, it ain't right
I want white diamonds, VVS it, them bitches light up the night
Feelin' like I'm Michael Knight
I just looked left, seen the police, so you know I made a right
Drop the coupe I spray it white
My lil bitch only want pipe
Aye, I walk round with the nina loaded, runnin' up on me ain't wise
Speed the coupe like it's hot wired
Feed the fam all on my mind
Molly and lean, mixed with Percocet and Xan, but I'm not tired
I stay ten toes on a grind
I put a peep hole on my 9
Pussy nigga try to bust through my front door, I put you on the ground

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My cell phone was boomin' like hell
I had to get me two phones
My lil bitch wanted some friends
I had to get her two more
All I do chase dividends
I fuck up money, make more
Yeah I got that pocket rocket, aye, I take it with me on the go
Can't chase that dough if you slow
I stay afloat like a boat
If you a drug dealer, put your wrist in the pot, when it come out it glow
I do it twice, pour a 4
I fucked her twice on the floor
When I pulled up in a coupe with no ceilings, I know she gon' want

[Hook]

[Outro]
I had to get what I could
My coupe the color that raw
I spent that ched like I bought
I walk right into the store, pick out whatever I want
I wake up do what I want
