[Intro]
Damn
Cardo got wings

[Hook]
Would kept my bitch, I should put ice on that
More codeine, less juice, it look like Cognac
At the car like, yeah, I want that
See that bad bitch, yeah, I want that
I want that
I seen the Patek Philippe with the diamonds, I want that
My bitch a petite athlete, you know I hit her from back
I want that
I want that
I want that

[Verse]
I though I'd let you know I walked into the Barney's with four stacks
I let my bitch hold the .45 in her purse and it was four racks
Walked in shell and spent 30 on Backwoods, four packs
Might as well go and pick up your bitch and get on that
I want that new Patek Philippe
Bought my mom some diamonds they were from Tiffany's
In the foreign and it's one in front of me
Bought a pound of OG, no one fronted me

[Hook]
Would kept my bitch, I should put ice on that
More codeine, less juice, it look like Cognac
At the car like, yeah, I want that
See that bad bitch, yeah, I want that
I want that
I seen the Patek Philippe with the diamonds, I want that
My bitch a petite athlete, you know I hit her from back
I want that
I want that
I want that

[Outro]
Want that new Patek Philippe
