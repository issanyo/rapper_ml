[Intro: Valee]
26 inch Forgiato
26 inch Forgiato

[Hook: Valee]
26 inch Forgiato
I want that Rari, no [?]
Cop all the new semi auto
I'm swerving, watching for potholes
I'm in the house, watching Narcos
Gucci shoes still got the barcode
Got the AK with the strap though
Walk to Starbucks, got a frap though
Bitch, these Margiela, not Aldo
I beat your ass, Rocky Balboa
I pu the guap in the wall
I spend a hundred on drop
I'm driving fast, fuck the laws
I got your bitch on her paws
My watch is icy, Jack Frost

[Verse 1: Valee]
I went bought me two iPhones
I'm just gon' text you, no calls
My bitch was tripping, no falls
These niggas chicken, no sauce
I told her take her clothes off
Bitch, I'm outside like a moth
Your pockets flat like a wall
My rocket gat gon' go off
You tryna race, well you lost
I'm smoking dope in the loft
Got your hoe choking and all
My bitch was poking [?]
Bitch, I'm not joking at all
Old school, I'm showing it off
My roof, I'm taking it off

I'm driving fast, fuck the laws
I got your bitch on her paws
My watch is icy, Jack Frost

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Pablo Juan
Rocking the Gucci with snakes on it
Don't fuck with no pussy, real niggas only
Bought a Rollie, Daytona
I poured up a four, that's a coma
Young nigga selling that dope, home
Thumbing through hundreds, I kept me a bone
Too many bitches, I don't even want 'em
I'm in the A sipping Dallas, smoking California
Street nigga with a trap diploma
1'5 overtime till 6 in the morning
Candler Road like the [?] on the corner
Hiding with the 6 and pull up on them
I unfold the chopper like a Transformer
Shout out the Migos, plug foreign
You whip the dope, you gotta scrape the corners
The wanna know how I touched down with the strap on me
