[O.C.]
Yeah, umm
This ain't a tribute, you still here, word up
You still here, Corleone

Chorus [Woman singing]
I know you can hear me cuz I'm still feelin you, oooh
(Feelin you baby)
I know that you can hear me cuz I'm still feelin yoooou, yeah

[O.C.]
Yeah yo
If I recall it was Valentine's Day
Me and the misses gettin ready for a night on the town to parlay
The phone ring, I check the caller ID
Seen your phone number, damn I shoulda answered it
If I had the slighest idea that was gonna be our last convo
I woulda picked up yo
Please accept my apology, I know you're listenin
It ain't a day that go by without the crew sayin we miss him
February 15th, you was judged by the most high
I was really mad at God
You had big plans, you was about to be the man and I'm
Proud to death that you a part of the fam
It be a privilege you associated wit us
I hope you in a good place where life is love
P.S. keep lookin over us, paw
Wherever ya at, wherever ya are, love ya nigga

Chorus

[A.G.]
Now what's the deal, dog
The tune really got me zonin
So I can't build long cuz it feel wrong
So I dedicate this to make this right
Rep you to death so it's Flamboyant for life
Missin you, wishin you were here back wit us
On this track wit us, but the facts are rough
Woulda loved to see you hit it off, that platinum stuff
But my dog was layed to rest when the gat was bust
You was the man in San Fran, headline in Amsterdam
I even seen you put it on in Japan
They had to barricade your wake cuz we came in packs
To see L, Coogi and specks, wit the hat to match
And that was dope, and if he woulda woke and spoke
I bet my next royalty check he woulda cracked a joke
1-3-9 live nigga, the hood die young
They say the good die young, Harlem fly nigga

Chorus

[Lord Finesse]
I know you hear us, L
I don't know how much can be taken by one man
Lost you and my grandmother in a five-month span
Thought we'd both live to see the golden years
Drinkin beer on the sidewalk in foldin chairs
If we couldn't spit rap, we'd live quite fat
Playin chess in the park, you know shit like that
When we first met, down at Rock and Will's
Knew it wasn't gon' be a problem to cop you a deal
Used to come through the block just to stop and build
It was all just a dream but shit got for real
When you signed your first deal, you went the slow route
You was a bad mothafucker kid, no doubt
You had the plan and all, standin tall
We stay breakin night at the gamblin hall
You know our steelo, we turn street corners into casinos
Blackjack to C-lo's, Spades to Pokino
We stack notes, played around, cracked jokes
Now you a livin legend of rap quotes
No doubt, you left a lastin impression
That's why I'm not too fond of people askin me questions
Your memories'll be hauntin to mines
Or cats out there who didn't want you to shine
They ain't know but I knew and you'll forever be
Big L Corleone, Mister MVP, feel me?
