Hit me with that shit one time

It's time to bounce (x3)
Can I have your attention please, this is your pal Doo-Wop
We are now shifting in to dance mode
Buckle up you're about to experience a lyrical journey in to Lord Finesses new EP The Awakening
Sleeping is prohibited
No Gimmicks allowed on board
And before we take off i'd like to acknowledge a few heads
To my man KRS ha he's in da house
To my man O.C. he's in da house
I can't forget Akinyele in da house
And the Zulu in da house

As we continue on big shouts to the legion the good fellas
Ghetto Dwellas, Jordan, Shorty, Keydo, Hollow, Timbaland
Mad Mob, 166 Street Crew, JD, Mad shout in order to all the masters around the world
Once again this is the Doo-Wop
Promising you and yours nothing but a real Hip Hop
