[Verse]
Sever the mind
Wonder what you'll find
Within the souls divine
Put â€™em on ice
Watch the nigga slip, think he will not suffice
Make 'em idle, all to be infamous
Time becomes a fucking rival
Basically battled the devil within himself
He faced the fucking tidal wave
Hands moving all in my fucking face, I hate this place
Goddamn, disgusted by my face
I feel like a waste of damn skin because the tint that's on my face
