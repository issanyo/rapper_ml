(Intro)
Uh, unh, uh, uh 2003, Lord Finesse

(Lord Finesse)
I used to coach the team, see i'm better on the mic
Find an ace up my sleeve, never on the dice
Sitting on a 2003 if you counting whats there
Sitting on a hundread and ten if your couting the spare
See, you're out your mind trying to face the gods
Your rhymes is like an empty prision, a waste of bars
No time flat, see I scrape the squad
We don't ask for shit, we just take what's ours
Got the skills of titanium, straight to the cranium
Try to play me and we can go to war like iranians
The deep cat, I speak rap
As long as the beat fat, my shit will be off the meat rack
Lord finesse don't harass the gods
Spit four bars, piss on like half your squad
Sorta savage, I don't gay bash I slaught faggots
You niggas playing russian roulette with automatics
See, on the street i'm the top of the rank
Three words when I get the dice you better stop the bank
Bet against me, yo you'll get your cash tooken
Even my street team promotes nothing but ass whoopings
How can you win in a world so cruel?
When you learn the game, niggas change the rules
You gotta keep cool get down and make moves
Show and proove of this land where cash rules
If money makes the world go round, so be it
I've been broke before ain't tryna repeat it
If your plan ain't talking about grands, I don't need it
If your vision ain't picturing cream, I can't see it

(Percee P)
A rap battle I can't be in
Cause i'm flipping them bastards like a gymnastic champion
I entertain, while amatures loose stamina
Trying to examine the lyrics that'll damage your brain cells
Yeah I pulled it, the gats trigger on fake black biggas and wack niggas making bullshit
Ya'll niggas need to quit popping a lot of shit
I ain't impressed with your rhymes so snap out of it
Foes, that are dastardly trying to smash the P, won't last with me using the full capacity
Rhymes i'll give ya, flow like a river with a high tide
I glide swifter and different than others
Take a note or two before your shit flop
And you get dropped under hip-hops quotable
Catch a pro at this, i'm cold like this
Cause your wackness, can't flow like this, so go practice
Yeah, i'm lyrically with it, to take a hit and break your shit and make you quit it, if you try and get it
My rap recital on tracks is vital
Thats why no one attacks and trys to smash my title
If you're clever never try and play me close, champ
When I kick it, I get wicked i'm licking and sticking it like a post stamp
When I take shit, I can make hits
Acapell, I should sell a million never living like roca-fel-a
Gat deals and the rap feels
The reason I got bills cause I got ill beats and rap skills
And yes, ya'll as I bless ya'll it's me percee p and lord finesse, ya'll, fresh, ya'll
