Yo, uhh
Whether the prophecy
Or I'm kickin extra philosophies
I gotta see where these chickens at, I see the pac in me
Pop a couple chickens playin duck duck goose
I'm on a mission I select who let them young bucks loose?
I shine like planetariums, i bury em fast
Cuz my bars is flowin hard im bout to bury the mass
Don't care what chu set, I set it off no Molotov
I spit a flame so don't make me have to bring a pro pain
Insane in the membrane, my men's brains too
And I'm shinin like a diamond, only rough thing's yo
Cuz I'm too exquisite with these flows is wickedness
The niggas that chu kick it with is just like you
Oh, you niggas want beef? Well nigga I'm top rhymin
A diamond in the rough, no pressure but check thermometers
My oculus is shinin bright, perception is clear
I'm aiming for mountain top but got no one to cliimb it with
My climate is (uhhhh) whatever my climate be
I see what climate sees? yo bitch she climbin D
I'm climbing E, No nigga that's excellente
And I'm right on top of game, tell HOV nigga comprende
I'm the opposite of modern, my time is now
And you niggas can't see me
My styles is wild
You niggas P that's pussy so don't push me off the edge
Yes I'm sick but I'm trying not to lose my head
