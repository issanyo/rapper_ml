[Intro: Mickey Low May]
Hey kids!
Mickey LowMays Mysterious Clubhouse!
Hoo! 2016!
Drip drop, triads!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck assholes!
Hoo! Remember, don't tell your daddy and mommy!

[Verse 1: Butcher Fong]
Started from the bottom and we've now gotten here (Butcher Fong!)
In the beginning only had money to buy one Sausage McMuffin
Now we can buy two Asia continents
From wearing Uniqlo to whole body is Rolex's
Penises initially so small they couldn't be seen (Wow)
Until now everyday help your dad wear green hats (It's green)
Even your mom knows that we rap really well (Knows her products)
Mickey LowMays Mysterious Clubhouse are here today, how would she have possibly guessed
But some things in life never ever change (Yeah)
In our eyes, life is the flying sparrows in the sky
[?], Everyday it's different
The fire we have in our hearts for rapping will never be extinguished
From 2015 until 2016 (six)
We are Mickey LowMays Mysterious Six
Together with us six, shout it out
Your bitch and your mom, we will continue to fuck

[Hook: Yung Bumblebee]
Ten years ago, six people didn't know where to go
At the time, society was biased against us (Yeah)
2016 is our year
From life until death, we are Full H.A.M. Palace (HOO!)
Our story is up to us to write (Write)
The new ideals of Hong Kong are up to us to contribute
2016 is our year
From life until death, we are Full H.A.M. Palace, hey, hey

Ten years ago, six people didn't know where to go
At the time, society was biased against us (Yeah)
2016 is our year
From life until death, we are Full H.A.M. Palace (HOO!)
Our story is up to us to write (Write)
The new ideals of Hong Kong are up to us to contribute
2016 is our year
From life until death, we are Full H.A.M. Palace, hey, hey (Healthy Lin)

[Verse 2: Lin NippleTwister]
Six people, young and had nothing (Real people, real facts)
Big head no brains, and grades were shit (Ha)
How could we imagine that today we would get here (Ha?)
Full H.A.M. Palace honour our ancestors (Ha, hey)
Up down high low, don't distinguish anymore
Hong Kong Island, we're the realest, uh (Facts)
Six people, one heart
Full H.A.M. Gardens, our will cuts through gold (Four worded idiom, Kam Muk Cheng)
This message, today it's given to you
New Hong Kong, six hands built it up (Hoo)
People tell us to have our feet on the ground
But eventually we have to run far and fly high (Goofy), sing it together, (Fuck assholes) uh
Pok Fu Lam Road has a dream
Raise both your hands together and sing loudly (Pressing onto your intestines)
Pok Fu Lam Road has a dream
Trailblaze a new era of good sound

[Hook: Yung Bumblebee]
Ten years ago, six people didn't know where to go (where)
At the time, society was biased against us (Hey)
2016 is our year
From life until death, we are Full H.A.M. Palace (HOO!)
Our story is up to us to write (Write)
The new ideals of Hong Kong are up to us to contribute (Yeah)

[Verse 3: King C.R.E.M.E.]
One life, only have one chance
Work hard to replace all the other triads (Facts)
We Mickey LowMays in front of you smile from ear to ear
Behind you press your bitch to go poking (Facts), sometimes
I forget that I'm only 18 years old (Ha)
In the past year experienced quite a lot of laughs and tears (Facts)
Although in between us there is a distance of two countries
Come together we will still feed your bitch semen water (Hoo)
Nile Bun sees through the cold world
In rhythm speak about hurt that cannot be spoken about
Ask you, human life what's the meaning of it?
Apart from flirt, gamble, drink, do drugs, as a human, no morals (Lee Chak Keung)
In a universe without morals, world without morals
In a Hong Kong with no morals fuck your wife who has no morals (Hey)
No matter where we are
2016, is Mickey LowMays' year (Ha)

[Hook: Yung Bumblebee]
2016 is our year
From life until death, we are Full H.A.M. Palace (Yeah)
2016 is our year
From life until death, we are Full H.A.M. Palace, hey, hey
2016 is our year
From life until death, we are Full H.A.M. Palace (Hoh)
2016 is our year
From life until death, we are Full H.A.M. Palace, hey, hey

[Outro: King C.R.E.M.E.]
Actually, this bucket of shit has a story
Last year I wrote a song called 'Sino Smoke'
At the end of it, I asked myself a question
It was: 'Why the fuck did I just do that shit?'
Fuck
Still need to ask?
We Mickey LowMays no matter what we want to do, what we want to fuck, what we want to butcher
Will still not give a fuck who you are
After we're done
We'll just say sorry
Fuck
(Fuck you until you keep on spewing out shit, from life until death, we are Full H.A.M. Palace, hey, yuh)
