"Aww shit!" - Big Daddy Kane (Repeat 4x)

Me and the fellas, we used to be cool
Until I got the fame, the girls, and the jewels
Now I'm the big man, and they's the small cat
The walk around saying (Ayo Finesse thinks he's all that!)
I remember when brothers wouldn't back me
(The used to front on me) Yeah, exactly
They used to laugh, joke, and try to fool me though
Saying (Man, you wasting all your time in the studio!)
I used to get dissed by the neighborhood snapper
He used to say (What you on? You'll never be a rapper)
Now that I'm paid, rolling with an even crew
The brother be fronting, saying (I always believed in you)
Lord Finesse is what I paid the cost to be
Back in the days brothers used to step off on me
(Going to the movies, Finesse what's up with you?)
Yo, my cash is low (Aww, we can't fuck with you)
Even my family was dissing
Said I would never make it, there was too much competition
Out of the family, no one would defend me
Said I was better off getting a job at Wendy's
Back in the days they was confused, but now they see
So they tell me they happy and they proud of me
I know the others that be playing with the high credits
Saying (Fuck Finesse, and yo you can tell him that I said it!)
But when I'm in their face, looking for the payback
They're the first to say (Come on, you know I didn't say that)
The brother's copping pleas, I have no time to argue
Lying so much he should write a fucking novel
That's a brother I should waste and get rid of
I shoulda (Yo chill, fuck them niggas)
Yeah, fuck them niggas

	Fuck them niggas!  ("Take that motherfucker" - Ice Cube)
	Fuck them niggas!  ("I ain't bullshitting" - Kool G Rap)  (Repeat 2x)

People try to figure what I'm all about
So you always have brothers yapping at the mouth
(Finesse is my man!) That's what they shout, see
Fronting and shit because they know nothing about me
I lounge in the rest because I'm a brother that's laid back
So yap all you want but my pockets is gonna stay fat
I used to be fast to run and serve a crew
If you dissed me in the past, I have no work for you
I know who's a traitor and who's my man
I know who's gonna scram when shit hits the fan
I know who used to laugh, diss, and doubt me
But now they want to hound me and be all around me
Those the brothers that's always starting rumors
But yo, that shit is played out like suede Pumas
I make G's whenever me and my DJ flips
So I don't give a fuck about that he say she say shit
I'm a get mine, so I don't stay worried
I ain't scared to go all out and get my hands dirty
I could care less, cause I do what I wanna
Cause I'm getting papes and got my peoples in the corner
So I don't care about all my foes and enemies
Since I'm paid, a lot of motherfuckers envy me
They try to diss me because it makes them feel bigger
But I got three words: Fuck them niggas

	Fuck them niggas!  ("Take that motherfucker" - Ice Cube)
	Fuck them niggas!  ("I ain't bullshitting" - Kool G Rap)  (Repeat 2x)

I have a lot of friends since I'm living fat now
Calling on the phone with my song in the background
Saying (I wanna rhyme, Finesse can you teach me?)
Nigga please, you ain't been trying to reach me
Those the brothers who's around when you're winning
But wasn't there when you struggled at the beginning
When I decided to learn, they chose to remain dumb
Now they run around saying I forgot where I came from
Back in the days there were rappers that weren't nice
They used to diss me when I asked for advice
Telling me (Get outta here, beat it, go play kid)
Now they wonder how I got paid before they did
Others used to say (I hate they way Finesse raps)
Now I'm making G's so you know I don't stress that
I know who's a wannabe and who's a true pal
A lotta brothers dissed me, but who's sweating who now?
I weak is ignorant, only the strong learn
On the path to success, them brothers took a wrong turn
My goal in life isn't to prove I'm a badder dude
Say I'm the best and walk around with an attitude
I kick song raps and drop them on strong tracks
I used to go out for self but my mind is beyond that
I started with kid rhymes, soon I'll be big time
Straight up and down, word is bond, I'm a get mine
I got songs to lay and places to play
So I could care less what a motherfucker say
Rap is a live sport and the ball is in my court
And if I score points and you don't, it's not my fault
Cause I'll bust your ass on a fast break
When you mention my name get your motherfucking facts straight
I like to slap up those that act up
So if you don't know me best bet is to keep your trap shut
I'm not the type to go around and pull a trigger
But I won't hesitate to say "Fuck them niggas"

	Fuck them niggas!  ("Take that motherfucker" - Ice Cube)
	Fuck them niggas!  ("I ain't bullshitting" - Kool G Rap)  (Repeat 2x)
