[Intro]
Check it ...
It's all real in the Nine-Four
Shorties kaught up in the system
Just close your eyes ...
Picture a ghetto, break it down

[Verse 1]
Back in the days I was livin' swell see
I was ridin' bikes, rollerskatin' & playin' skelzies
But nowadays shit is different
Little kids be riffin', the motherfuckers won't listen
Instead of shootin' tops they shoot Glocks
They point 'em at cops (*Blam*) and that's the way they get props
Yo, they do what they wanna
Fuck a 9-to-5, they makin' G's on the corner
Material things is what they want to scoop
They can't get shit like that, workin' for no summer youth
They got clients, they livin' like giants
They got the whole drug shit to a science
They got, jewels and beepers, hundred dollar sneakers
Lexus coupes : Windows down boomin' the speakers
They got, bitches in flavors, probably fuckin' your neighbor
C'mon ! They got shit under control like the mayor
Man, you see the news today
So how you gonna tell these little kids that school's the way ?
Yo, it ain't about I.Q
Some of these kids are makin' more than doctors
And didn't finish high school
Teenagers are caught up in the system
And God forbid if you front on 'em or try to diss 'em
They got everything, from Nines to shotguns
And they'll put 2 in your chest and lounge til' the cops come
If you ain't from the ghetto this is undercover
But in 94, shit is real like a motherfucker
Tryin' to strive 9-to-5 out in the street
There's no rain or shine, trying to get ends to meet
Fuck the cops they don't obey the law
And if you ain't catch on by now, I ain't even tryin' to say no more

[Hook x2]
Shorties be wildin'. "I don't give a fuck
I'm just a squirrel, that's out to get a nut"
Get a 9-to-5. "What? That shit sucks
And besides, I wouldn't make enough."

[Verse 2]
In this time and day, kids get paid in all kinds of ways
And get more respect, than niggas that's three times they age
I know a child that's runnin' wild
That say fuck playin' tag, he's tryin' to get a hundred thou'
So it's hard to find a stable child
Kids are watchin' violent movies, or either got cable now
And they catch on so quick
Bout time they hit 16 they be on some Nino Brown, G.I. Joe shit
When school is out, they just wanna lamp
The last thing on they mind, is motherfuckin' summer camp
And 80 out of a 100
All they wanna do is clock dough, scoop bitches and get blunted
Kids is strapped, they be packin' shit
I seen shorties get iller than villains in some action flick
They say times is rough jack
And when you tell 'em cool out
Man they quick to say "Fuck that!"

[Hook 2x]
