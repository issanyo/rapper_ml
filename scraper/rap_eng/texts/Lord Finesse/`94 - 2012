{Verse 1: ROME}
From 94 to 2012
DATboyROME been raising hell
My room's a cell
Im locked in just the dark and myself
Imagine that, its pitch black
My only friends are my thoughts
But even then I get lost
Cause my mind just ain't right
Its playing tricks on me
See my head wasn't screwed tight
I need to fix something
But it'd change nothing
Cause a nigga too much of a rebel
In the hood a nigga got several
Ways to make the money, need it but don't love it
Focused on coming, up!
A little street struck
So I roll and tuck, or I
Tuck and roll, marijuana blow
Lets cop some cigarillos
Fill em up with mo
And I be rolling up, slowing up
Till the day I go
Its now 2012, but since 94
I've be rolling up, slowing up
Till the day I go, Word

{Verse 2: ROME}
I sit and I stay
Sculpting my brain like its clay
They wondering if I'm ever gonna come out and play
Got niggas messin and stressing
They trying to peep out my game
My plan is being myself
So no one can do the same
Im just doing me
Weaving and dodging these lames
No time for playing games
Nigga im grinding for change
Maybe y'all should rearrange
See I be
Pouring and Strolling
I smoke a blunt while I roll em
I'm always unstrapped cause if its my time then I'm going
Im down to spend my whole life flowing
And growing mentally smoking medically
These niggas don't understand
DATboyROME be the man
The contradictions worth more than ya life span nigga
From 94 to 2012
