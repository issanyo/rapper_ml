[Hook: Juzmin Rose]
The weather will never be the same
No matter where I go
The main reason will never be the fame
No matter if I blow
Trying to see what the world can give me
And what it has to show
Just come ride with me and say
Goodbye, to San Diego

[Verse 1]
Hopping on the train, or riding in a bus
Talking on a plane, or riding bikes in front of us, yup
Feel the breeze on the deck, what you see and expect
No need for the check, when you free from the nest
I didn’t want to leave all you
But I’m doing it so I don’t fall through (through... through)
The cracks of the rap when I play in the game
So a million other people can remember my name
It’s Nik Bates, straight from San Die-
Go-ing up to Long Beach, to build upon fame
No fortune, that isn’t in my sights
But I’ve been fortunate to re-envsion all my life
I’m trying to take control, and decide my fate
With a million other rappers, trying to take away my plate
Wait, ain’t no half stepping on the ground
Of the studio, you know that I ain’t messing around

[Chorus]
So let’s go to the LBC
Come with me
So let’s go to the LBC
Come with me, and say goodbye

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Here in San Diego we just hide from the stress
Wave at today, and say goodbye to the next
Bouncing on the block when we writing a check
I would give a lot so I could ride in a Benz
I got a lot of friends, but they don’t know
I’m trying to make ends off spitting a flow
I don’t know if they believe I can blow
‘Cause I’m still sitting on these tickets to my show
Whoa, At first I didn’t really want to leave
But things will turn out better when I’m living in the Beach
Twisting up a seed, and watch my life grow
Walk in my clothes and watch my eyes show
You the real meaning of the life that I live
Not selfish, but I don’t think I would like having kids
No marriage, without fame, it probably would delay kid
Unless I’m living in a Hollywood relationship

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Are you really gonna miss me?
I could tell by the way you never hit me
Up. So I might come down
Unannounced, with an ounce, out to downtown
How without sound, can I put out rounds
'Bout how I pound, down without grounds
Loud without doubt, clout without crowds
I’m shitting on these rappers without an outhouse
Proud is how I’ll, leave the SD
See me next week, I’ll speed to LB
C, and to the D’s, leave on repeat
Speak with free speech, I dream to see me
Independent with a friend and we will probably do it big
Get a check and we will spend it up in Hollywood, and live it
All again, and for the hell of it, you’ll probably wanna tell a kid
You grew up with me, ‘fore I left the SD

[Hook]

[Outro: Nik Bates]
“See the guy up on the TV? Yeah that’s Nik B
McMillin Elementary is where he met me
Used to kick everyday ’til he went up north
To live out his dreams, and I’m proud it worked”

“See the guy up on the TV? Yeah that’s Nik B
Rancho Del Rey is where he met me
Used to kick everyday ’til he went up north
To live out his dreams, and I’m proud it worked”

“See the guy up on the TV? Yeah that’s Nik B
Olympian High School is where he met me
Used to kick everyday ’til he went up north
To live out his dreams, and I’m proud it worked”
