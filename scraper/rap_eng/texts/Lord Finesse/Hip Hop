[Hook] x2
I start to think, and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing I'm trapped between the lines
I escape when I finish the rhyme

[Verse 1]
Hip Hop is like the beat of a heart
Maybe broken but never truly torn apart
All the time am I asked what defines the art
I'm not sure to you, but do know what to do, just start
Been countin my blessings every day
Never once will I cower and back away
The same goes for the culture that I back today
Created in a time of the nation's prime where people didn't hide behind an image
More realness than today's revision
Step back from the screen and y'all could listen
Gettin by with beats, rhymes, and livin
Forgetfully giving fucks for how to fit in
Always tryna be a real decent man but it's hard born sinnin
I know I haven't started college yet, but
Droppin out would be a regret
Rushin into things, not yet
Let me carefully inspect, how I'm livin

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Everything I say is true and honest
Not too sure what to accomplish
But information soak up all this-
Dream we entertain til I abolish
These stereotypes about people out here livin
Who gives a fuck about complexion if you're driven
Leave it to the youth to see colorless
Preconceived thoughts judging, shit's a mess
Hip hop was built on power over division
Had to point it out but not to mention
We are all equal since the prequel yellin power to the people
And when I see y'all
Made sure it's no free fall
Reppin Golf bitch! but you didn't see no tees fall, huh
Let's meet up in Okaga, CA
Maybe get a freeze frame
Wanna wake up and ask God for a good day
Cause it's all about the mindset, could you catch a replay?
Anything that you're into be all about
If you can't do it, don't pout
There's always a route
Hip hop wasn't fallin out but now I caught up and it's what's around

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When you're just jumpin in the game you better be stuntin
Who would be yourself when there's frontin?
Ain't feelin that y'all
That's creatin your downfall
You think Jordan changes to ball?
Practice and talent is all
Create the place to do it yourself and take advice from nobody else
Being determined let's you envelop
A love and passion that will soon develop
Into the grind, no rushin things take your time
We tryna create the rhyme to blow your mind
Use it when I'm in a bind
Stain in the game? Splash some tide, huh
Not too many who I ride-
With, Then again the flow switch
Not often ill but keepin it sick
Hate on me and you're a prick
Real Hip hop is the pick

[Hook]
