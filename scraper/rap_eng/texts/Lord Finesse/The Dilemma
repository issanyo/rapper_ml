[Verse 1]
I might do good
I might do evil
I can't do wrong
But can't do legal
When everything is black and white
Simplicity please you
But when you're Living Colored
It's so much on the easel

It used to be horseplay
But now niggas play horse
I shoot, you shoot
Yeah life is a racecourse
We pacing the highway to heaven nigga
Roll the die for a snake eye or a seven nigga
You get the point

Tryna push truth while pulling my blunt
Chase my henny with the 40 oz, my cup overrunning
I'm treating every single meal like it's my last supper
Cause life is bitch but death can come quicker than bad lovers
And I want a bad bitch
But I need a woman
I fuck around so much
That I might end up with nothing
I'm always leaving the love cause lust keeps me coming
Watching Instagram girls bust it open for comments

But why you always come around when I don't need you
I seen so much crazy shit in my life
So when I open my eyes and I see you
I ask the lord for advice
Just to escape from the vice because

I know something gon' change
But I got a lot of things in my way
Love the person you are
And not the person you ain't
And just remember you a nigga
At the end of the day, but

[Chorus]
You saved some souls
But you still ain't holier than thou
So I'm just praying when time comes
I'm hoping that my mind's made up, what

You saved some souls
But you still ain't holier than thou
I say i'm praying when my time comes
That imma, imma have my mind made up, what

[Verse 2 ]
The other night I chopped a line and made the stars align
So much white on my gold Amex my black card declined
Situations looking far and fine
But when it's up and close and personal
You see the ugliness defined

Bump 1, Bump 2, 3, 4
Bump like a traffic jam seeping through your pores
You see I already got some but I need more
Cause when I get mine homie
Then you gon' get yours

I wanna be free
But I wanna be money
I wanna have your back
But nigga what 'bout by stomach
Yeah a nigga ate but I'm still fucking hungry
You already know the story
So you plotting upon me

But let me hold it down my nigga
So maybe I can lift us up, yeah
Just so we can grab our dick
Grab a 40 oz, screaming out we don't really give a fuck

Niggas never got our mind made
Brother, sister doing time they
Was told that the best things in life are free
But when the motherfucking crime pays, I'll wait, I'll say I saved

[Chorus]
