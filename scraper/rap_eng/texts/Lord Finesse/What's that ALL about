[verse 1: JRAL]
Yo i wreck pre's because the flow is not predictable
If you see the smile on a individual’s face
Then your music must be invincible
Once they heard i could flow i was no longer in the shadows in  middle school  or elementary
Being the place to be invisible
DIOBF mischiefs i am the sword that is attached to the villain
Killing every mc in the the hip hop scrolls it was written
I see so many fat mexican bitches that have eye brows that every day that are so styled and thicken
If you put that gun  to that damn  plate just remember this is your own damn decision
Shogunning with JRAL you already fucked up your whole unit
We widespread like plagues into your subdivisions
I have no time to be listening into these street rap rats
If they want the fame and the mac 10's
Shot their own cousin
Ended like a candle light that’s so damn easily
Then they come back from their cells staying constant to their indecency
I’m getting tired out with these poor unoriginal references
Hearing every day the person is not irrelative with me
(Yeah) you chowerhead scum
I will defeat you with my rhymes with the gun shots
Your low class villain group is the population to now of being one

[verse 2: Floem]
Rap its simple but complicated to explain
Not all of the best rappers start with instant fame
I write lyrics but yet no one knows my name
See theres levels to this shit dude video game
Im not the best freestyler live life spark a lighter
Im a Lover not a fighter dont ride high low rider
Keep your eyes open cuzz my words have been spoken
Am I the rapper you're provoking or the kid you're now showing?
Take something really confusing and make it understandable
Ill pour more gasoline cause it makes you more flammable
Vulter when you're dead they torture
You're getting really far I think you need a closer
Fuckin white bitch this ain't no fuckin pictoinary
Your captions misspelled I think you need a dictionar

[verse 3: Skin 'N' Bones]
Back again
School session when the next recession hit
Move with the deadly clique
Grope ya like a python did
Rhymes ain't equivalent
Final waiting sentenced death
Sound come busting in
Raw keept the dominance
With the show of monument
Raise the fist in common men
Slang bouncing in your head
The sight of burning blowing lead
Smoking till the end is shed
Inner eye most definnet
Dungoen Dragon murder kit
DOOM slang represent
Stretching from Ohio, Iowa, to Washington
Bitches crave the sausage fest
DOOM crews with the best
Fake emcees get none or less
Fuck with DOOM we break ya neck
Come with that penmanship
That shows clear intelligence
From the SouthMost residents
DOOM GODS Chunk, Killah and Bones written in the ancient templates

[Verse 4: Floem]
DIOBF couldn't get any better
I'll take your music put it in a shredder
We are here to deliver a message to the whole nation
Can you stare in the face of the death that you're chasing
I got them killah rhymes that increase over time
I spit them in the mic even when i'm shy
JRAL, Triston even Skin 'N' Bones
Are rapping their very best with the killah Floem
They tell me you ready bro lets just go and show them
Giving them the hard core rap that will blow them

[Verse 5: Skin 'N' Bones]
A mass murdering ryhme that i commite
As soon as i start to spit
No ones safe better lock your house hide your kids
Yo the Clan of Mischiefs are at it again
The same hooligans
Seeing 616 digits marked on your apartments

[verse 6: JRAL]
I'm about to perish this class with rhymes longer than a cord of extension
The corruption is just a little scene of what the comprehension
Is in the fixed layer of the crooked eyes of perfection
So pierce of what i am the real motherfucking rejection
So step up motherfuckers you coming in the zone of doom
We slay and bury our enemies and here comes a plantation that blooms
Into the wind that is captured to the shine of our swords
You saw the shock when our flows killed the pharaohs and became the damn motherfucking lords
