(Verse)

We adapt to destroy
And fight against the decoys
We're heavyweight like Leroy verses Holmes
Wrote this verse at home, not off the dome
Don't ask for loans
Cause you we're there when I was alone
My mind, body and soul rose like buoyancy
I'm a rudeboy, can't you see
Hide yourself and your keys
Cause, some emcees I can slay with ease in my sleep
Gotcha like mice going for cheese
Celebrities say cheese
Cause y'all are imposters
I got that good posture
My stance is wicked, no witches bitches
Just applying glitches the way Sega Genesis did
They manifested cause their mind are twisted
Got the fast lane on the freeway
I'm gone and I didn't even evolve
This combination is extremely deadly, so dont test me
Yeo, yeo my flow is similar to Energizer
Cause I keep going and going
Flowing and flowing
Might rhymes cocky sometimes, but I'm not showboating
The sound waves are causing a crazy commotion
Your cranium's moving in a vertical motion
Now we're about to make imprints
Not dip quick like the rest did
We quit, we keep through knowing what we wanna do
Not bum out like the rest of you
We're not stressing
We're restless because of you fools

(Hook)(x2)

We got nothing to prove
Or nothing to lose
Tell nothing, but the World the truth
You can't do this
We're too sick
This is elevator music
