[Lord Finesse as a preacher]
Thank you, thank you, yeah
Here we are
Right and early in the morning
Looking around I'm seeing all of you brothers and sisters
Looking good, smelling good
But I'm not here to play around this morning
You know, here to tell you
The time for the coming of the Lord
Yes he has return, you know
It's gon' be a great awakening
Special for those going around worshipping these fake peoples
All these imitation Lords
It's only one
Can I get a Amen? (Amen!)
Let me get a Amen! (Amen!)
As I look from the podium
Seeing a bunch of fornicators
Some true 2 da game
Some hip 2 da game
Going out now that's a little food for thought
So the donation basket is going around and around
Donate all you can
I need a platinum album
Not a 100 not 50 thou
Please call and bet
Can I get a Amen? (Amen!)
On that note I'd like a moment of silence
(*Silence*)
Aiyo Sammy
Hit me with that shit one time
