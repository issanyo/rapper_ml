[Hook: Lord Finesse] (x2)
I’m hip to
The game (Right), I’ll always be
The same (True) ‘cause whether I’m
Broke or got fame, sunshine or rain
Ain’t a damn thing changed

[Verse 1: Lord Finesse]
Finesse fell off—that’s what some figure.  You better
See Mary Blige and get the 411, nigga
I rock rappers frequently.  I’m like
Stevie Wonder—I can’t see a brother beating me
Wanna throw joints?  You’ll get spanked, fella.  Wanna talk
Dough?  I’m seeing more cash than a bank teller
Wanna talk girls?  You can’t follow this—I’ve been
Through more skins than the average dermatologist
I’m no joke on a fast or slow tip
Pockets stay so thick, be on some down-low shit
I turn emcees red fast
I’ll never sell out—fuck that, yo, I’m deadass
I’m rolling like TNT.  When it
Comes to this, ain’t another brother seeing me
That’s why opponents always get scared, ‘cause I’ll
Make brothers go, “Ayyo, now that’s that shit there!”

[Verse 2: Lord Finesse]
Check it
Brothers better lounge when I pass through town
(You better recognize) Don’t know?  Better ask around
Word life, I’m not a new figure.  They say
“Good things come to those who wait”—I’m overdue, nigga
I’ll lounge and rock tunes.  The way I be
Saving the day, give me a cape and a costume
But, no, it’s not Batman.  It’s the original
Blackman that goes back like the Gap Band
I don’t run scams, got dumb fans.  Yo, I’m one
Man that’s quick to toast a nigga like a sun tan
People wondered: would I rock again?  Shit
Rap without Finesse is like life without oxygen
It’s no quiz I get biz.  You know what the
Deal is: rap ain’t shit if it ain’t real, kid
Can’t a rapper out play me
(Do your thing, kid) Word life, no doubt, baby

[Verse 3: Lord Finesse]
I don’t stutter, I’m so butter like no
Other.  Word, I’m that funky type of soul brother
I get stupid but I’m dumb wise.  I’m one
Guy that can rock a party from night until sunrise
You can’t mess with the rap lord—that’s like
Saying you can dunk when you can’t touch the backboard
Hah, I got the smooth rep.  I got
Styles that kung fu motherfuckers didn’t use yet
How long I been rocking raps?
Since niggas was wearing Lee’s, marked-necks, and sporting stocking caps
Plus, I’ll be flipping figures in ‘9-
-5 and beyond, best believe I got some shit for niggas
