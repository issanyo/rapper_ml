[Verse 1]
Yo I'm all across Bronx
Stepping in the blocks of building
Dead rats in the turbin
Today I think about servant MCs
Claim the glees but they can't take my pad agree
Comin from a bloodline designed
Keep that head 'till that spread
Number two let my weapon, my pencil
Gotta kill your temple
D plus that pimple
Never the resin to, as I enter the optimist tourain where i get my slang
Thirty to the brain
Grandfisher is my dope man
Corki George has a brain
This is why I pay homage to the game
Put it down baby if it says that I claim
To all the whores who oppose, I forcit blood so close and not from a bloody nose, so behold
The lord from the warry of cold
What you let off is coming back ten false
You been told

[Chorus:]
Cause it's time for the pillon to shine like the sun, plus rise like one cause competition is none
In the world where the best is done, second to none
Guns fully loaded so you know the outcome
