Let me hit you with this line drive these rhymes fly
This is how it went down in the 9 5
Thats right because I said it did
Dont sweat it kid, dont think im nice I am give me credit kid
I wreck niggas, collect figures
Shit im like [?] of Franklin, all I want is some respect nigga
I drop facts when I rock raps over hot tracks
Thats why niggas be on my dick like a jock-strap
Give me the best, i'll get with him
Even deaf people be saying: "heard that kid got some shit with him,"
