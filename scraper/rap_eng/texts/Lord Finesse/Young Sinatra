Visualizing the realism of life and actuality

[Verse 1]
Various women, I'm swimming in, like a shark
Tear the pussy apart, shawty it's on after dark
Step to the mic and now I got ya, call me Young Sinatra
The flow is prominent, hella dominant, on time with it
When I'm rhyming it, several labels itching to sign with it
Let's check the women I'm bringing in with these ill synonyms
Softly killing 'em, in other words; I'm Lauryn Hillin 'em
I swear to god if I could I'd never turn the page
Living the rest of my days on stage
Fucking with bitches that never age
I'm so fly that I defy the laws of physics
I ain't think it was possible for a check to have this many digits
Mathematically exquisite, am I cocky—just a smidget
If you want beef then we can supersize it
Freshman in the game
So they wanna haze me like my name Isaac
I killed the beat and dig a ditch just to fossilize it
To make sure none of you bammers try to reprise it what

[Hook]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Life's a bitch and then you die
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some

[Verse 2]
I'm working a nine to five just to survive, barely staying alive
Hard to stay focused without the drive
See I bus tables and my homie Castro is a waiter
I can't wait to blow and say "I told you so haters!"
Living the life of a egotistical pistol gripper
Isn't a life for me, I'd rather grip mics and undo girls zippers
But not them ho girls, meet me after the show girls, but take it slow girls, have 'em coming back for mo' girls

[Verse 3]
Various managers coming up talking bout they got me
But really they shadier than Slim in a pair of Versaces
I know you see me shining, and practicing and grinding
While they conform to the norm you'll catch me designing
A different type of sound
While you was stuck inside the box, I had already been around
Inner peace and happiness I'm always tryna' find it
And I kinda got the feeling that a woman is behind it
So I'm always chasing tails the real life sonic
And I'm always spitting fire half black, half demonic
Nah, I'm half black and half white
C'mon this sound it had to come from somewhere, right?
Nah, nah, see homie race is not the issue
And if you stepping to me like it is I'll dismiss you
The second you listen, the second I got you
I swear to god I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

[Hook]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Life's a bitch and then you die
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
