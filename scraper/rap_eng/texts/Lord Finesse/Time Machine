Yeah, where my time machine at?
I'm going crazy, the clock is reminding me that
Man, I'm gone, I don't know when I will be back
Father Time, where my time machine at?

[Thiago]
I'm getting better, spitting fresher than the stick of a Stride
With the element of soul along with rhythm and rhyme
Nothing limits my pride, till I get to my prime
I'm sticking with this, it's my mission, nothing different in mind
Time tickers in the sand, moving quicker than I can
Transmission of my thoughts to the fingers of my hand
And some kids don't understand, to this, I'm not surprised
Even I'm trying to figure out the riddles of my mind
I'm getting lost in these labyrinths
Camping on the cold stone floor, can't ignore the inhabitants
I'm adamant that all that's happening is just a test
But this maze is so enraging, so much freaking stress
And it's best if we all slow down
Accelerate less before the cars blows out
And the stars glow now, can't see, but I can feel the nightfall
We're lost, don't know if we'll be alright y'all

This crazy life I'm living really got my mind addled
I fill my raps in a box and call it a time capsule
This time travel has got me seeing all kinds of shadows
I'm in deep, you'll never find that my rhymes are shallow
Everyday I revisit the past while spitting a rap
At the point where I can barely tell the difference
This may be hell I'm living, or maybe paradise
A couple flashbacks equals a couple scary nights
This time machine must be taking its toll
I'm feeling grumpy like a redneck both racist and old
I cater the flow, so take a bite of what they say is life
But in reality, this precious thing is pain and strife
I chill out the second the music starts to play
I jazz it up with Rick James and Marvin Gaye
This shit creates peace, you can call me crazy
I hit play on those nights that I can't sleep

I'd be lying if I say things haven't changed a bit
I'm losing sand of time, trying to find grains of it
Found the fountain of youth, but didn't take a sip
Now I'm paying rent just to maintain this maintenance
Of sanity, a coper, keep losing composure
Live in old memories to realize they're over
You were bolder, nights you wouldn't think to fear danger
People in the pictures are nothing but mere strangers
A clear wager, you changed for the worse
Your music isn't played and your name isn't heard
What? You're shameful and hurt? Well, build me a bridge
And cry a fucking river and I'll stain it with dirt
Because the past is the past, your last is your last
You're not fast enough if you're faster than fast
So speed up kid, make sure your gears in check
Because the day you buzz up is lightyears ahead
Dead
