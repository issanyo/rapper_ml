[Lord Finesse]
I used to coach the team, see, I'm better on the mic
Find an ace up my sleeve, never on the dice
Pushin' a 2002 if you shout and you stare
Sittin' on 110 if you countin' the spare
See, ya out ya mind tryna face the God
Your rhyme is like an empty prison - a waste of bars
No time to flash, see, I scrape the squad
We don't ask for shit, we just take what's ours
Got the skills of titanium, straight to the cranium
Try to play me and we can go to war like Iranians
The deep cat, I speak rap as long as the beat phat
My shit'll be off the meat rack
Lord Finesse, don't harass the God
Spit four bars and﻿ piss on like half ya squad
Sorta savage, I don't gay bash, I slaughter faggots
You niggas playin' Russian Roulette with automatics
See, on the street, yo, I'm top of the rank
Three words when I get the dice: "Stop the bank"
Bet against me? Yeah, you get your cash tooken
Even my street team promote nothin' but ass whoopins
How can you win in this world so cruel?
When ya learn the game, niggas change the rules
Ya gotta keep cool, get down and make moves
Show and prove in this land where cash rules
If money makes the world go 'round, then so be it
I been﻿ broke before, ain't tryna repeat it
If your plan ain't talkin' bout grands, I don't need it
Ya vision ain't picturin' cream? I can't see it

[Percee P]
A rap battle I can't be in
'Cause I'll flip on the bastards like a gymnastic champion
I entertain well, amateurs lose stamina
Tryna examine the lyrics that damage your brain cells
Yeah, I pulled it
The gats trigger on fake black niggas
And wack niggas makin' bullshit
Y'all niggas gotta quit poppin' a lot of shit
I'm not a bit impressed with your raps so snap out of it
Foes with audacity, tryna smash the P
Won't last with me usin' their full capacity
Rhymes I'll give ya, flow like a river
With a high tide, I glide,﻿ swifter and different from others
Take a note or two before your shit flops
And you get dropped by the Hip-Hop's Quotable
Catch the pro at this and Kodak this
'Cause your wackness can't flow like this, so go practice
Y'all ain't lyrically with it, physically fitted
To take a hit, I'll break your shit
And make you quit if you try to get it
My rap recitals on tracks are vital
That's why no one attacks and tries to snatch my title
If you're clever, never play me close, champ
When I kick it, I get wicked
I'm lickin' and stickin' it like a post stamp
It takes six, I can make hits accapella
I could sell a million never living like Rockefeller
Got deals in the rap field
The reason I got bills 'cause I got ill usin' rap skills
And yes, y'all, as I bless, y'all
It's me Percee P and Lord Finesse, y'all, fresh, y'all
