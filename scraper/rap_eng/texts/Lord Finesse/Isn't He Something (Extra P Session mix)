Once again it's the man with the flavor
It's Lord Finesse so run and tell your neighbors
So stop sleeping and check out the style I'm freaking
I stomp opponents and give hoes the silent treatment
Forget striking out, I'm hitting grand slams
Taking opponents off the stage like the Sandman
After Apollo I'm the one to follow now
I kick the shit that biters can't swallow down
Mics get lit up as soon as I get up
Opponents I hit up, make em quit and want to give up
I'm kicking a party like kung fu
Snatching all the girls as soon as I say "One two"
Brothers think I'm new, but they're dead for instance
I was into rap before they could form a sentence
I'm finally getting mine after coming up the far way
So nowadays I just lounge and parlay
I'm hip to music, whether jazz or country
I'm the type to make anything sound funky
I like to talk and shout and go and flow
Ayo, some brothers just don't know
That I can take on any played out wack style
Rhymes so deadly you should put them in a crack vile
I kick a rhyme as soon as you say when
So hype on the mic, when I finish you say "Amen"
I'm not the type to go around fronting
Ayo, they don't call me Lord Finesse for nothing
