[Intro: 'The River Wild' sample]
"Where are you?" "Hey, there you are!"
"How does it feel to know you only have a few more seconds left to live?"
*gunshot*

("Big L" - Cut and scratched)

[Big L]
I stay jeweled up, pockets swelled up from banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep in a triple black dark tinted old jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
On the block all alone and put a Glock to his dome
Tell him, "Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split"
Prick, it ainâ€™t nothing decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
Mad niggas be fronting a lot
Popping mad shit, tryna be something they not
Your faggot ass better stick to dancing, don't even look at me
I might break your jaw just for glancing, that's right
In '97 Harlem kids is blowing
And we don't trick, we'll let a bitch starve till her ribs are showing

("Lord Finesse" - Cut and scratched)

[Lord Finesse]
Heated divine mastermind that turn nickels to dimes
The authentic genuine that's out to shine
The cool cat, the true mack, the smooth raps
Chickens be like, "Who that?" I be doing my thing, kid (True dat)
Forget fronting, I'm beyond that, I roll with brothers ready for combat
All for eye-to-eye contact
With skills, G, yo it's ill see, for real B
Ain't no barbecue, niggas better stop tryna grill me
Huh, sent that style to the essence
Got niggas stressing my style, pull like fluorescents
No question, tough type to clutch mics
The positive upright, I'm the "I don't give a fuck" type
Expose the facts, you know the haps
Could go to laugh astrological, like the signs in the Zodiac
Your rap crew out the stack loop, word up
My style's tighter than a fat bitch in a cat suit
Suprise G, it's not wise see to size me
When I operate, it's Smooth Sailing like Ron Isely
Gotta do my thing, word up (Beg ya pardon?)
Time to bounce, gotta skate like Tonya Harding

("A.G." - Cut and scratched)

[A.G.]
Yo I'm the cleverest top ten terrorist
Chickens ever diss they become featherless
Hate derelicts, certified gold medalist
You play fly cause I'm the most high like Everest
Look at all these fakes, musically you imitate the Crates
Won't succeed moving at full speed with no brakes
Like Jake, watch me take your entourage
Can't see me, I'm camoflauge and besides, I'm God
Mad hard like the S.A.T. who have shorties
Caught up in the mental, watch her bless A.G
Evidently you still don't know because you tempt me
Thought you was the boss when your fat thoughts were empty
Not Fat Joey Crack but still Jealous One's Envy
Who sent me? D.I.T.C., good and plenty
Like the doctor, smoke a Spike Joint and watch "Clockers"
Get rude like Shabba, make moves behind my blockers
Crazy sickness, you want the pure, you'd better pick this
Bitches can't get this, faggots remain dickless

("Fat Joe" - Cut and scratched)

[Fat Joe]
Before we get started, let's talk about these coward-hearted
MC's that claim to be true O.G.'s
And war specialists forever bust your guns on the sack of shit
But when the beef come, get on the ___ before I protest your licks
You know the deal, I come with nothing but the real
Certified pejente, recognize mi gente
Whether East Coast or West Coast, I'll make 'em all strip naked Bitch niggas will never get respected
Joey Green bagging devils up in Bowling Green for all is clean
Cock the 9 soon as I seen his Rolie gleam
You know the team, never giving a fuck
Laying thick in the cut, get your shit laced up
What the fuck!

("Diamond D" - Cut and scratched)

[Diamond]
Yo I'm flipping on niggas like treys of crack
My raps react on your cardiac like a heart attack
Some niggas front for stunts
Who want to take a puff of the blunt and play a nigga like a chump
But I don't play that shit with no chicks
Sucking the next nigga's dick, moving bricks
I'm too slick for you high school dropouts
You got knocked and tried to cop out
Couldn't fight when the kids pulled the mop out
And wails you out, writing home saying, "Bail me out"
Little small time, fucked up when you called mine
D Squared, one of the Greatest of All Times

[Outro: Diamond D]
Yeah, D.I.T.C. representing for the '97, word life
