[Verse 1]
Yo
Look, now there ain't much in my life to talk about
All I do is make dumb jokes and let these words out
And hope you take a minute and fall in love with yours truly
And I only spit the words for those who don't understand fully
So take a listen
Use everything that I was given to compliment the persona of this life that I'm living
And every thought is written and spitting, and fuck fitting in
Lost in the world that I'm living in
Rather be forgotten than remembered for giving in
Yo, peep the flow
Sixteen year old rhyme sayer
Peace sign, see you later
You can love or be a hater, shit I don't really care
You can stand in line or take seat when you find a chair
It's right there and I'm just trying to capture it
But I'd rather stay behind instead of going after it
But all these other kids keep running their lips
They told me to swallow my pride, but I only took a sip cos I ain't trying to get sick
Nah, yo I ain't trying to get sick
And I ain't trying to get sick
They told me to swallow my pride, but I only took a sip cos I ain't trying to get sick
Only a sip cos I ain't trying to get sick
And I ain't trying to get sick

[Verse 2]
Now there ain't much in a song for me to say
But I've been living my life with a middle finger to the sky like, "Hey, what the fuck are you looking at?"
I just like to rap
I might be this and that, but I'm not a fucking scrap
So fuck you, you faggots are annoying as shit
You can suck my fucking dick while I'm saying fuck your clic
But I gotta calm down cos I ain't even violent
Got a ring of the sirens, get it down to a science
Yo, peep the flow
And I gotta let it go in order for me to grow
So hold it down for the crew cos we trying to get through and I regret what we do
Yo I got a lot of things to clear out, so hear me out
So you can know what I'm about before they seek me out
But don't ask me why, I ain't even gotta try
So I just write rhymes so I can get by cos I ain't trying to die
Nah, yo I ain't trying to die
And I ain't trying to die
So I just write rhymes so I can get by cos I ain't trying to die
Nah, I ain't trying to die
