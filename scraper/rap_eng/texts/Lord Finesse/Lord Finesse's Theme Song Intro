Ladies and gentlemen, introducing that bad mutha, that funky technician, that slick brother with the fade and the half-moon, ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Lord Finesse! Throw your hands in the air, do something! I don't care if you breakdance, do something! The brother's in the house and he's dancing, and the DJ Mike Smooth, and they're gonna get crazy funky for y'all tonight
