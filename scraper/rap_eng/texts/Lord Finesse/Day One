[Diamond D]
Now its the mad magician with the ill deposition
No repetition holding down Bronx traditions
My compositions simply squash the competition
Step up and get beat into submission
Cause this musician with the street intuition
735 fuel-injected transmission
My opposition will have to recognize my steez
Exotic trees, leave a trail of scuffed up knees
So please you couldn't touch this cat with a stick
Quick to inflict tricks blaze up in the flicks
Son I'm sick and you could put that on my mama
Exclamation point, quotation, comma
Lay up on the beaches when I'm down in the Bahamas
The skills go back to the days of Wonderama
So pass the scama, son its time to get this money
So we can relax and recline where it's sunny

[Big L]
I went from standing on the corner selling cocaine
To ripping shows live on stage with hoes yelling my name
To be precise ripping mics is the light of my life
You fronting like you trife but never pulled a heist in your life
The price of my ice is sky high, I'm a fly guy
That's every thug's dream I really love cream, it's in my bloodstream
You mad cause I got more chicks than you, more bricks than you
More nines with extra clips than you
Where I live it ain't a nice town
You can't walk around iced down
Some clown probably getting stuck right now
Peace to D-I-T-C, Show and AG, Fat J-O-E
Diamond D, Lord Finesse, and me
I'm from the East Coast, this is how we roll in New York
A bunch of rowdy niggas holding the fort
Jacking creeps, packing heat, these Harlem streets is for keeps
Much love to all my peeps who got covered with sheets

[Hook]
Most these rap cats don't know where it started, where it came from
We been repping this shit since Day One
Digging In The Crates originators
Why niggas player hate us, knowing damn well you can't fade us

[A.G.]
You better take me out quick
Cause I'm accurate when I bust mine
And make it count like Jordan at crunch time
Just in case I play Fishburne and double up on nines
You could never make it rain or stop my sunshine
So I keep eyes on these chumps the whole time
Take note of your technique like we scheme on dimes
Disregard your crew, fuck your heart
Put a slug in me, it'll be marriage, til death do us part
Until then master this art and kill them
With the pen that's dramatic, automatics I commit sins
Hold my head, but when I've had it I test chins
If that ain't real then feel the stainless steel
Bang 'em and hang 'em like they did our relatives
Thought he was the best on the mic that ever lived? Negative
Wu-diggity if you with me then say word
Lets get twisted like bottlecaps [and] create like Spielberg

[Lord Finesse]
Check the referral, man my whole squad's thorough
We worldwide, niggas just nice in one borough
We all gleam, plus we fiend for more cream
You got some nice players, they just on the wrong team
Knah'mean? As the world turns
To who it concern we'll set you straight like a perm
Rap apostle, lyrical type Picasso, kinda hostile
Nothing less than colossal
You dig me like fossils, be the cat with the groovy soul
Lotta rappers out here acting with no movie roles
You know the deal, I represent skills
And niggas with bent grills that live to make a mill
On the real that's my motto, too hard to follow
Will die in sorrow before I'm going out like Gravato
Hard to hit like Lotto, underworld role model
D.I.T.C. we be them cats of tomorrow

[Hook]

[O.C.]
Holding it down for D.I.T.C, niggas stink like feces
Coming against raw dogs you're lost
The way I stimulate rhyme and rhythmatic timing
On beat, off beat, drunk flow here we go
Assignments handed out, each individual stand out
Carrying his own clout
Phenomenal Moses of rap I pose a threat
Foes I put 'em on a block like a hole in a pen
Lyrical genocide on the witty side
Niggas give me respect due, like the pope in a synagogue
Who weighing my odds? O.C. far from a fraud
You waste my time nigga so I bagged your broad
Blow your mind ditto with no conscience
I decide the law motherfucker I'm Congress
This concludes my repertoire of what I be on
MC's make way for mines or get peed on
Fuck that
