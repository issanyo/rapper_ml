[Intro: Diamond]
And you don't stop, ah keep on (Repeat 8x)

[Diamond]
Yo praise the Lord for Showbiz
My partner with the beats with the Nikes on his feet
Buying old records is a habit
I get more run than a Volkswagen Rabbit
You know I gotta have it
I got more props than the cop called McGarrett
Who played on Hawaii Five-O
When I formed a production company with Show
And Jay's Studio is the lab (the lab!)
But the session is closed cause I know you got a big nose
Trying to sniff out the name
You lack originality, and that's a damn shame
Don't front, I know I got you open
Like a pack of tokens, yo I pulled your coat and
I'm not the one to be gamed on
I didn't know it was your girl we ran the train on
But no hard feelings, your girl was appealing
Did my share of dealing, sexual healing
You didn't know she was a groupie
But I'm a put you up on a scoop, B
Used to live in Forrest, my daughter lives on Morris
Used to play softball with my man Horace
I kick flavor like my man Sonny Chiba
Aries is my sign, I'm compatible with Libra
I like to program beats
Diamond D is out, I wanna say peace
Showbiz there's deals to make
So let's get busy and dig in the crates

[Showbiz]
Yo, thank Allah for Diamond D
No afro instead he keeps dreads in his head
My partner from the past, from 163rd
Back when I was a hoodlum beating on nerds
It started way back (way back when?)
About 12 years ago, I was 9, he was 10
Before smoking weed or hanging out or playing hooky
We used to breakdance in the jams, "Electric Boogie"
Girls watched jocking, my nickname was Rock and
Crowds I was shocking, freaks I was clocking
Step up and see Showbiz performing
My beats hit hard like big George Foreman
So MC's and DJ's who thought they was nice and
Get upset like Buster did to Tyson
That wasn't the plan and he's still my man
Since he beat up Mitch Green outside Dapper Dan
Wait a minute that's a different subject
Talk about the Moet and the papers that's in effect
Back to the Show, the Show B-I-Z
Down with D.I.T.C., A.G. is my MC
Relying on the Giant, the Giant I'm relying
Never crying for the crack because I'm not a crack client
Girls stick like Crazy Glue, they think they're getting dough
But I treat hoes like drugs, I just say no
I lamp in the residence I'm keeping dead presidents
In fact, I like my pockets fat not flat
A rapper not a singer, so hooker don't bring a
Problem to me, so go ahead you humdinger
Show's about to blow in '91 so I'm straight
Down with the crew called Diggin' in the Crates

[A.G.]
So get back, get your sticks and get your bats
Get your licks and I'm a still get fat
Try to diss and get the backhand
I'm dressed in black, a black hat for a black man
The Giant is better and clever
Go ahead and sleep, and you'll rest forever and ever
I'm like a bomb, sometimes I'm calm
No telling what can happen once the mic is in my right palm
Me and Showbiz too deep, but don't sleep
Go ahead and retreat or face agony of defeat
A.G. is in command
You remember the black hat and the bottom of my Timberlands
Save it, if you think you pose a threat
Just chill and watch how many hoes I get
Now you sweat the props I got
(Kick a rhyme) A rhyme? Sure, why not?
Always get fat to a hype track
So Finesse (What's up?) sike, give me that mic back
The crowd I'll capture, microphone master
Finger licking and kicking lyrics from here to Africa
I'm the bold kind, my rhyme's a goldmine
Let it off, set it off, just for old times
Think you're ready for this, you wanna battle
Your music is riddle raddle, your rhymes are scribble scrabble
The Giant is greater so I'm great
Down with the group called Diggin' in the Crates

[Lord Finesse]
Now when it comes to lyrics, mics I pulverise
It's Lord Finesse, time to go for mine
So stand back, let the men play
I put rhymes in shape just like Bengay
I'm great and honorable, suckers I bomb a few
I run more games than a carnival
I'm a get mine, as soon as you say start
Sweat hoods and funky rhymes is my trademark
I'm a get fame, not from her or his name
Cause yo (What's up?) I'm funkier than a shit stain
Mics I smoke, rhymes I hurl
My hobby is collecting fly-looking girls
Strictly for the ladies, call me Lord Finesse
And I'm all about money and sex
Finesse is the name to say, and I came to play
We could have fun, but put the whips and chains away
Sex and money is what makes me a happy man
And I sport more styles than Jackie Chan
I keep rising, I'm not the type to sink low
Me take a loss on the mic, I don't think so
Lord Finesse is out to make papes
Down with the crew called Diggin' in the Crates
