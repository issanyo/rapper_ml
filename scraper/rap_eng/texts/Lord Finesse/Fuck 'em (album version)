"Aww shit!" - Big Daddy Kane (Repeat 4x)

Me and the fellas, we used to be cool
Until I got the fame, the girls, and the jewels
Now I'm the big man, and they's the small cat
The walk around saying (Ayo Finesse thinks he's all that!)
I remember when brothers wouldn't back me
(The used to front on me) Yeah, exactly
They used to laugh, joke, and try to fool me though
Saying (Man, you wasting all your time in the studio!)
I used to get dissed by the neighborhood snapper
He used to say (What you on? You'll never be a rapper)
Now that I'm paid, rolling with an even crew
The brother be fronting, saying (I always believed in you)
Lord Finesse is what I paid the cost to be
Back in the days brothers used to step off on me
(Going to the movies, Finesse what's up with you?)
Yo, my cash is low (Aww, we can't fuck with you)
Even my family was dissing
Said I would never make it, there was too much competition
Out of the family, no one would defend me
Said I was better off getting a job at Wendy's
Back in the days they was confused, but now they see
So they tell me they happy and they proud of me
I know the others that be playing with the high credits
Saying (Fuck Finesse, and yo you can tell him that I said it!)
But when I'm in their face, looking for the payback
They're the first to say (Come on, you know I didn't say that)
The brother's copping pleas, I have no time to argue
Lying so much he should write a fucking novel
That's a brother I should waste and get rid of
I shoulda (Yo chill, fuck them niggas)
Yeah, fuck them niggas
