[Hook]
Get toasted, get toasted
Get toasted, get toasted
Get toasted, get toasted
Man I know kid, you wanna get toasted
Get toasted, get toasted
Get toasted, get toasted
Lose focus, get toasted
Man I know kid, you wanna get toasted

[Verse 1]
"We living in the moment"
You bogus at stoning, unless you really own it
You fronting when you blow it, unless you really show it
You stunting for the hoes and they don’t really know it
Just smoke it, don’t even try to fight it
Don’t tell me that your sparking up, homie just light it
Keep it to yourself when you’re seshing in the night and
I don’t give a damn, ‘bout the grams you ignited
And I really don’t care if I wasn’t invited
Don’t care about the color of the swisher you divided
Dump out the guts, like you taking out the trash
Jump out the truck, when you blazing out the stash
Hitting hash, getting smacked, green cash on the dash
Backpack with the flask of the Jack and the grass
Gas mask, pass that, grab that ash and
Gasp as fat drags blast that glass

[Bridge x2]
What you doing? Nothing just chilling
Eating Air Heads, now I’m up in the ceiling (Mom he did it again!)
Did it again, influencing the children
To do it with a friend, ‘cause it’s oh so thrilling

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sitting on the couch, mad seats been filled
Thinking how I sound, man he’s so ill
Living underground, damn he’s so real
Coming for the crown, and he will steal
The top spot, feeling hot, when I drop
And I’m lost, as I cough, getting hot from a shot
Gonna hop in the yacht, sail off to a dock
And I plot, as I knock, unlock, and I walk
In your spot, and we talk, then it got real hot
Pop off Glock, sawn off shots to your block
Can’t stop, watch cops got dropped nonstop
Crack rock, concoct, stock rockets to the top
Blowing pot, and the bong, is a lot, don’t cough
Then we swap, and you plop, give the pipe a lip lock
Wait now, shake the daze out of your face now
As you sit there stunned, ‘cause you so spaced out

[Bridge x2]
