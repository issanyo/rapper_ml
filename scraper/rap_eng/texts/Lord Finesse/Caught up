(verse 1)

Nowadays shorties caught up in the system

Uh

Peep it
I'm thinking of 911
I'm taking em straight to heaven ain't nobody want none of my blessings or listening to my lessons I hear sounds of Smith n Wesson's
That's snapping like breaking a bone
When you hear it don't be near it there's noway your making it home
Oh my lord
What has gone wrong?
We could talk it out if you were to answer your phone, but no
Then don't play Dean Martin, we could sway
Or sit up on the dock of the bay
Okay okay
This a, kid out of Upper Hutt not messing around with other sluts if you proceed to rap shit faggot you get an uppercut
Whenever I feel like smoking problems out steel pipes
I just sit think, observe, remember that this real life cause

(chorus) x2

Nowadays shorties caught up in the system
Straighten up little soldier cause today we on a mission
Listen to my vision but don't you twist it don't you bend it
And we could start a movement comprehend it?

(verse 2)

Well
Smell the lavender scented weed in the passenger seat
Sit back relax and just pass it to me
I got, nothing but H if you bragging bout G's so what's up?
I'm telling B to watch what's happening C
I throw up
Different symbols like subliminal messages better said your forever dead and nothing's happening to me
Cause, shorties caught up in the web
2B writing without led is like me reciting with a pen that is dead
I, said nothing in the bed can't you get that through your head knew my direction so I left these leopards follow to the def
A lot of crime is in the east
So I took it to the west you can see beauty in the beast if you can see behind the stress unless I pull out all my hair and dread it
Start all over again you stupid if you ain't get it
I said it yeah you bet it
I stole my mama's credit
Never I'm over thinking this the world I wanna be dead in

(chorus) x2

(verse 3)

Yo acting so stupendous
And lend another kid to your appendix like Brenda is gonna be pregnant cause no Jimi on my Hendrix, Hey Joe
Shot 2 out of seven so stay low
By a month I'm getting paid slow so I'll never be rolling in peso's
I'd wrap a halo around your head because I'm anal
You'd suffer the consequences but slowly become an angel
Let me feet swing
I'm falling, they watching my legs dangle
You crooked then you not straight on a tilt like an angle
I'm tryna get my mind straight, life lessons while time waits might stress it like Tom Waits, sing about I and dilate, saying
Me me me on your MP3 they envy me enough to get on MTV there's plenty sea that I can go along but time is lost in space
Now I'm the boss and with more powers than Austin, wait!
The state I'm in is like fucking with my whole cranium
Feeling out of proportion but suck it up and just tell them I said

(chorus) x2
