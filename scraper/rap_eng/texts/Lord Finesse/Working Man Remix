The working man, this shit crazy
Life changes every day
This the remix

Niggas ain't the same since I last grew up
Wanna ask for myself, don't wanna work
You don't wanna help, certain extent
Niggas take advantage and won't pay no rent
Wanna use you til you can't use yourself
Take everything you have, even what you built
What ever happened to the real niggas that love they self?
Can't love yourself when you hate that bitch
You gotta slow down, it's some dangerous shit
Most niggas look the same and they act the same
Watch too many movies, wanna re-create
Wanna be the biggest nigga in the city
Well look, it gets way bigger than the city
Police know that a nigga a murking niggas
So if a nigga die, they just blame a nigga
That's a real bad position to be in
But see friend? With the love we can't amend niggas
Live by the code, that's all they done in the hood
The savages, I ain't big enough
That shit ain't cool, I had enough
Other death and the problem was sex
But is the human nature a stress?
Cause I've been in the cities that count them checks
The poor people over there, the middle is mixed
And the rich people rest, you won't see em
Only on the freeway, or when they cleanin they B
Ya gotta slow down, and take your time
Why niggas so jealous when you're good like him
Stop thinkin bout money, you trippin again
Saying what you don't have and what you need
Keepin my grateful turkey just to get a piece
It's 3rd world poverty in the USC
But it's different, let's say to Africa
In America you could be 3rd world poor
But you're still in the land of the free
Forgotten about, forgot like me

Mr. Glassface, I'm the working man
It's the working man remix
This is for the people that love
Put your hands up
It's Lil B, Glassface, let's go!
Yea
Shouts out to everybody
Worldwide
I lay you all the working
Man, the working, what man I see
