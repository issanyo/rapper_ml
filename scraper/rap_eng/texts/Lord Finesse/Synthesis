[Verse 1: Skeemz]
Mr. Airplane Flow with no pilot
Cause every show after is sure to be a highlight
Toast to the high life
Sip a Miller High Life
Weed for my niggas and some Remy that's my night
I'm getting back to not giving a fuck
I only want ya shorty if she paid a grip for the clutch
Superficial super flow
Superman, super dough
Yeah you in the building my nigga but I'm the super though
Loafers, rings, clean collars and shades
Bills getting paid Versace is getting sprayed
Life of a real nigga allergic to fake
So you know I gotta sneeze when the lames come my way
I ain't tryna ball man
I'm tryna coach Jordan
And own the team I'm a little more important
I don't want a portion
I wanna pull the Porsche in
Back out in the Bach
Leave when I floor the Benz
Bronx nigga going bonkers
Monster, mobster
Cracked lobster swagg obnoxious
