[Verse 1]
MCs; I waste and wreck, not the guy to face or test
Rappers talk that murder shit and never been to laser quest
And I'm tired of hearing all these phony brares
So I'm dropping bombs on motherfuckers worser than Tony Blair
I got insane raps shooting from my brain fast
Striking with impacts harder than a plane crash
The first verse hurts, the next is the finisher
Cause I'm dropping words more real than a cinema
The flows you choose are dead, I use the best and never snooze or rest
I'm truely blessed, delivering rhymes like UPS
When I turn up I'm VIP
Let these MCs see that I'm MVP

[Hook x2]
If rap was a game I'd be MVP
The Most Valuable Poet on the MIC

[Verse 2]
Writer slash producer with more breaks than glass jaws
I've been killing kids on stage since I was in Class Four
Got plans to get ill and real in the wealth
I could become Catholic and I'd still be feeling myself
I'm busting hard ruckus bars giving suckers scars
And I'm creeping, stay deceiving people like a push up bra
I'm smooth as hell, writing lyrics 'fore I knew to spell
My script's computing well but dude, you must use a Dell
I aren't talking 'bout the singer, I'm the bell ringer
Hell bringer for lads cunt spit for their next dinner
Sting like a bee, never bite like a flee
Cause their lyrics are week and I'm MVP

[Hook x4]
If rap was a game I'd be MVP
The Most Valuable Poet on the MIC
