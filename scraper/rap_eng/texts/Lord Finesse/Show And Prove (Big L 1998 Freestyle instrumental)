[Intro: Big L]
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nothing Butthead

[Intro #2: Lyrical Prophet]

[Verse: Lyrical Prophet]
Man I'm feeling so musical, this feeling ain't unusual
Bars in my head i'll shoot em out, I ain't refusin' bro
And maybe I should hang you from a fucking rope
Cause that loud in your system but you still ain't soundin' dope
You say you got that fire, but you ain't matchin up
You got that whack flow, boy you got me cracking up
This just a freeverse but make sure that you slap it up
And you know where I stay, you ain't gotta map it up
Who's better, man? that ain't no fuckin question
I'll let it be known in this mothafuckin session
Never been number 2 so don't try to test me
A's on my projects, so i'll teach you a lesson
Your tracks ain't even close to impressive
Your career i'll wreck it, less then a second
Giving y'all warnings but you just won't listen
Got me all feeling like a Jehova witness
Nah I ain't dissin' don't get it twisted
Just being a little rude while I come hard with it
Saying that i try too hard to be raw in this business
How can y'all say that when I always been this
Maaan, maybe I should end it with a punchline
Enough of that just thanks for a minute of your time
Hopefully there's something that you recognized
And that's that Hopsin ain't the only one with an ill mind

[Outro: Lyrical Prophet]
