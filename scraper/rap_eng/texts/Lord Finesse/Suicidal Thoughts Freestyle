(Verse)
Walk with my head up, swinging my stress, nigga
The calm comes collect figures, place your bets, gorillas
We stomp around as a empire to state, let's us bring the kettle out, burning out, what you wanna claim?
I'm saying I'm displaying hot flow into the game, let's not debate
I'm shaking, I'm aiming to deliver rage coz most think I'm playing when I say shit, you lackadaisical, licking arse and just saying, shit

Heads up, swinging my dreads, nigga
The plot thickens, while I only had a pot to piss in
I persistently pressed the button, whilst screaming fuck it
You think it's nothing, but i just steady emptied the bucket
List of mine , peace of mind, I've seemed to seek right above it, I'm winning, you just haven't discovered it
Went and hollered my cousin, told him that it's nothing less than big success
After X years of dealing with these pens?
We both been through it

Now look at the outcome
I'm running like I'm Usain Bolt running from Jamrock
You heavy into bars as well
I can't complain I cannot, I'm proud
Shout outs to you coz where you were as according to now, there's no doubt you made your mother proud
And according to these people, I must of come off feeble
But make no sound, when you see that we're not as equal
I bet a pound that the pounding is lethal
Nah, F that!, I'm certain
If I show up then it's curtains, for certain
Certainly berserk that I'm lurking from under the dirt and you're irking coz the perks that I'm learning to starting to firm, and you're pissed off
I'm murking, I'm working and murking and working
You done motherfucker went and ticked off the wrong person, and so I am curving, I am gone
I'm gon' walk with my head up, leaving the rest, nigga!
