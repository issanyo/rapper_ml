(Verse 1)
I wanna make it big some day, and be hella rich
I wanna give my parents a huge house and buy em a ton of shit
I wanna have them quit their jobs and relax a bit
I wanna see them rest after everything they did
I wanna finish high school with a high GPA
I wanna go into college like a boss and graduate
I wanna get my degree and live my life very comfortably
I wanna spend my days making bread, and have fine women come to me
I wanna be a millionaire rapper who sold a lot of units
I wanna one day find a girl who's so file like Mila Kunis
I wanna one day finally solve a mother fucking Rubik's
I wanna live my life with fucking prudence, man let's do this
I wanna be known, no "who dis", be the top dog like Brutus
I wanna live in a world where we all live in peace like Buddhists
I wanna evolve into something greater, be brutish
I wanna live in a world where our own cops don't shoot us
Shit's the cruelest

(Verse 2)
I wanna have my own studio where I could spend a lot of hours
I wanna improve Downtown Sioux Falls by building a couple towers
I wanna beat everyone in my path, leaving them look like cowards
I wanna fix my mom's back and have her sleeping on some flowers
I wanna make sure my brother does in life what he wants
I wanna start beef with rappers and laugh at their response
I wanna be a cool ass dude, doper than the Fonz
I wanna see my dad live good and hope that he respawns
And that goes for my mother, brother and my sister too
I wanna give them anything they need to accomplish what they pursue
I don't give a fuck how much it cost, you want it? I got you
I don't want them to worry about which bill to pay, which card to use
I wanna be a successful business man, get my degree in marketing
But it's this music shit I truly want man my passion is hardening
Man it's truly hard to be, a student with a job and a dream hardly
Been sleeping but fuck sleep, pardon me, desire flowing through my arteries

(Verse 3)
Yeah man I get it ok, I'm just a stupid kid dreaming
Thinking he can be a god and lately it's been seeming
Like just that, a dream, I promise, I'll be at the top soon
Just like Logic said man, there's fucking footprints on the moon
Bitch, I can do it! I want this shit more than my next nut
I desire and lust after this more than a sex slut
More than the best butt, distressed up, shit better rest up
Sick vest with one breast cut, get dressed grab the desk cup
I'm the best yeah I fess up, come arrest me, I'm lesser
I'm about to run up to this rap game shit and invest up
Imma be on top, fucking cumming out my left nut
Have the industry keep screaming, "Damn that's the best fuck!"
We want you to stay, and shit I ain't going nowhere
I'm leaving my handprints on this wet cement, so there
You go that's what I want in life don't you tell me I can't have it
Cuz the moment you do, I'm going crazy, causing havoc, making magic, bitch I've had it, bitch I've had it, bitch I've had it
