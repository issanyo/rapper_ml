Yo turn that up

This ones for the ladies, who be trying to have my babies

(hook x2)
I'mma just be zoning when you play these funky rhythms (x3)
When you play these funky rhythms

(verse 1:Appetite)
Spill the beans your secrets out
Kill the beat and bump it on your speakers loud
Im taking soles from all these rappers see my sneaker count
Im in my zone and still relaxing,vibing to the sound
Got a flow thats dispensable
My bestfriends mary medical
So ready go
I ain't here to say that im the best of all
T-O-R-O-N-T-O is who im repping for,
Started an amateur but working to professional
These niggas coming after the dot, like they was decimals
We open hoes,leave 'em open holed, and let her toes just curl
If she ain't shining like a diamond we ain't handing pearls
Think i'd be lying just by tryna say my hands are full
You can rock a helmet but my verses still be cracking skulls
Plastic dolls
See bitches with they make up sprawled
Facial walls
To cover up they little flaws
So let me hit the source
Spill out all these different thoughts
A different course
Right or wrong, just tell me if its true or false

When you play these funky rhythms

(verse2:Appetite)
Now I just laught hard at these past hoes, tryna make up
Been like 3 years since they last said "waddup"
Now they tryna link up
Maybe toke a lil chronic
Some exotic, puff a lil bit tryna catch me unguarded
I'll be honest
Shawtys try to play smart,but playin idiotic
Mind I keep it sharper than razor blades and faster than sonic
She dont get it? got it, i'll just sound it out like phonics
Flow hypnotic,addictive now they hooking on like narcotics
Just pick up the pace
All these shawtys think im playing games
Thrilling off the chase
Get me high and lift me into space
Wonder 'bout some shit
Fallin back so roll another spliff
Another hit, just pass it 'round theres 'nuff to give
