[Big L]
Yo I'm the one who made you get on the dance floor
And shake 'til your pants tore, so party people clap your hands for
The one they call Big L
I'm hot as hell, I'm livin' swell
My name's ringin' bells, can't ya tell?
So grab the MoÃ«t and take a sip
I stay lookin' dip, mics I rip, but don't flip
We on the party tip
I get so loose, on tracks that I produce
MCs be frontin' mad hard but got no juice
I'm not the type that strikes out when I pull mics out
Violate L and it's lights out
And if you got no skills on the mic you oughta dash
Cause rappers that're sorta trash, the Big L slaughter fast
I'm gettin' high rates in all states, makin' papes with the crew called:
Diggin' in the Crates!
I'm a rap crowd amazer, microphone dazer, Big L is the man with the unexpected flava

Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava

Now when I'm on the stage microphones I lock tight
The Big L rock right when I'm in the spotlight
Yo I'm a young dapper rapper that dress well
Foes I expel, the ladies wanna sex L
Because my raps are real raw
I'm hard as a steel door, with skills most MCs'll kill for
I'm known for grabbin' the mic and then droppin' a raw rhyme
Big L's the greatest of all times, so gimme my props, I want all mines
Battles I refuse to lose, I chose to cruise smooth like the blues
I never hear boos cause I abuse
In '93 I'm blowin' up like dynamite
And don't think I can't fight because I'm kinda light
L's a teenage poet that men fear
Chief to be sincere, you got no wins here
I play MCs like a game of Sega
Cause I'm poetic, and this is the unexpected flava

Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava

Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava

Now I'm gonna kick flave 'til the microphone's broke
And I'm known to do the wild thing like Tone-Loc
I screw whores, I do tours, I'm smooth like Lou Rawls
I write raps that hurt MCs like blue balls
In all zip codes, the Big L rip shows
You couldn't touch this if you was on your tip toes
I live in the ghetto and rap is my route out
Now I'm on wax givin' my crew a shout out
Since I'm paid I could knock any ho' boots
But L wasn't so cute when I had no loot
Now I'm lookin' slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my dick
Ayyo my cards I'm playin' well
Picture that, a rapper slayin' L? No way in hell
My rap skills are sharp like a razor but don't sweat it
This is the unexpected flava

Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava

Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
