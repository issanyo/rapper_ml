[Intro]
Kinda tired, of these talking niggas

[Verse]
Yo, i'm still trying understand like what is you saying
Ya wack ass verse proves ya mouth what you be spraying
Nobody rock with you but boy, you's a fucking punk
Talking bout me, you had no flow right from the jump
I'll really fill you up, bitch nigga I keep the pump
You look like the type of shit that a baby threw up
That senseless verse is just about to make me get bucks
Talking bout I got I got no girl, like I give two fucks
But you gone be a virgin at the age of 98
Niggas saw that I was a king in 1998
You got 99 problems, that's 99 killers on your head
And Toby stay taking up for you, is you giving him head
Or maybe he just saw i'm disrespecting his little master
Told you shut up yesterday and I saw you went Casper
But you try to return today you little bastard
Talking bout war, must don't know who I am lil bastard
You really shoulda had checked my resume nigga
I will really knock off your little toupee nigga
Hit yo bitch ass up make you say touche nigga
Ever saw lasers? I ain't talking CD's by Lupe nigga
I'm talking bout the shit that'll have you pissing ya pants
You and Toby talk the most but look like ya'll ballerina dance
Fucking bitch, all this talking's really making me sick
You still follow me on social media, hop off my dick
Why you follow me, if you claim you don't like me
I think it's cause you wanna study my style and bite me
Bitch nigga you just shot at a whole tank of propane
You know that I be really serving more lines than cocaine
You ain't no man, Jaee is more of a real man than you
How bout ya switch positions, that sound like a plan to you?
Name ain't even Ace no more, get your facts straight
Fore I knock your spine out of socket and you need a back brace
Nigga you need to stop all you shits are dissapointments
And yes I Cut Deep hoe, i'll send your pussy ass some ointment
