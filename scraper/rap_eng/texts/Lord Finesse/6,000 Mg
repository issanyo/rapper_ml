[Verse 1: La Mique]

Short ugly and not fit. He's 5'6. Chink eyed. Like he eat his rice with the chop sticks

Eyebrows thick as fuck. And I think that shit is stuck, Together like the bitches that he got inside the trunk

So .. don't .. push .. me... BeCause I'm close to the edge
And don't touch me, let me roll out of bed

Unless you want your Cufi roofed like it went over your head
The other kids now a days are overdosing on meds

Aight I lied about the whole trunk shit
But I got 6,000 Milograms of potion and some bottled emotion

Ready to wrecking all these ships like a pirate in the ocean
And that pirate will be my father. Cause my father never noticed

He was always leaving Llama out
Mama said I'm Wildin out
Like I wasn't in college, Now guess what!? I'm dropping out

I'm fucking done man I'm giving up and I'm opting out.. You really think I'm bad? Aight I'll show you a problem child
