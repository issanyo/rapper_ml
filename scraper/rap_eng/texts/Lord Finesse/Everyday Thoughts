[Verse 1]
I drive a station wagon
Hop up out the door with my skinny jeans saggin'
Clothes aren’t even matchin’, but I’m still swaggin’
Waiting out front, ‘cause my friends’ still laggin’
Don’t know they got a 40, ‘cause my friends still baggin’
Walk up on a song and you think that I’m braggin’
Puffing on that strong, ‘cause my back still naggin’
Tracks that I’m smashing, in fact I’m not imagined
(Hah) I’m not a wannabe, ‘cause they stay actin’
I could change the world, and I’ma do it through rappin’
I got it down patted, fro still matted
Wake up in the morning and my back stay cracking
Flow still packin’, hundred round stackin’
Know I’m up to bat and I ain’t even been to practice
But I’m still smacking, out the park whackin’
Whatever I be lackin’, I’m backin’ with passion

[Hook x2]
This the everyday life of an everyday dude
But that don’t mean I’m living everyday like you
Everything that ever made you say “That’s cool!”
Is either everything I knew or everything I always do

[Verse 2]
Swagger on a hundred… A hundred pennies
Saving for a week, so we could go and eat Denny’s
Dude still broke so I never wore Fendi
Ask me if I knew it and I thought you meant Wendy’s
Wanna cop J’s but I keep on forgetting
I only got 20 knots in my checking
Pay ain’t come, but I keep on checking
Sprinting to the finish, ain’t no half stepping
I’m reflecting, pretending, we ending
But I’m dented, defending, repenting
Start again, and we befriending, we best of
Friends, but I need evidence, we meant it
I need a rest, from the rest of the stress that I’m dressed in
Obsessed, I expect for these checks to be the best and
In a sec, I be next, getting neck, in a Bentley
The effects of the specs in the texts that you send me

[Hook x2]

Lord Finesse don't sue me!
