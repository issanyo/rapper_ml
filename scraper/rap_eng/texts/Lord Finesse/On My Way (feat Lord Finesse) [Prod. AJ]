Hook: [P-Mack]
Cause I'm on my way (I just be riding the wave)
Cause I'm on my way (I just be paving the way)
Cause I'm on my way (No longer Vanity Slave)
Cause I'm on my way (Y'all niggas stay in your lane)

Verse 1: [P-Mack]
I'm on my way to the top, so they be blowing my phone
I got more pictures with me on some throne
Soon as I get it I hop out i'm gone
If you're on your way then you might as well go out and get it
Started from nothing just wait till i finish
Matter of seconds just wait till i'm Sixty
That's why I told bae I'll be back in a minute
I hop in the back of the class, avoiding the clash
They fronting i'm back in advance
I talk of the future, you live in the past
It's getting all tense cause that's how i'm gon' last
Was willing to spill it, for pain I was feeling
But now that i'm winning, i'm close to my ceiling
They know that i'm killing, they switching opinions
You posing no threats, you just posing for pictures (My nigga)
Nah! Nah! Nah! Nah!
Nah nigga P-Mack don't lie
Came through hopped out in a low ride
New Wave on the way in a boat ride
Night Shift work hard till the sunrise
Switched lanes got love from the 2 sides
Bang! Bang! AK to the lame guys
On the way Lord Finesse with the cosign

Verse 2: [Lord Finesse]
Reminisce back when I would talk my shit
'Bout the Rollie and the Benz in the future
Dreams of balling with my nigg' in a whip so big
When you pull up, they salute ya
Move da
Fuck out the way, yeah
Bird's eye view, pree the game from the heights
Man I outgrew being slave to the light
No I O U's so behave 'cause you might
Get lost in the darkness
When I say I'm on my way it's from the heart it's
Confirmation I'm the nation's next star it's
Motivation just to make it outta dark pits
On the edge, but I pledge to give you sharp hits
Young Lord man, finessing all my targets
The aux cord has a preference for my heart shit
P-Mack on the way, man you got this
Man you've got this
