The block so hot you could cook an egg on the sidewalk
An again it ain't my fault
Ill choke a lil soldier acting like he colder bolder older

We be in the back smoking killa sacks
Taking rabbits outta top hats
Where you think you at you better finish that
My tats tells stories your skin is boring man i like to be lonely an smoke the night away
Moons raising title waves take the path i pave an well get there then split it like a pair
Dangerous like a bear terrorizing state fairs nigga

The block so hot you could cook an egg on the sidewalk
An again it ain't my fault
Ill choke a lil soldier acting like he colder bolder older
