[Intro:]
I just want you to know
That even after all that you've done to me
The lying
Leaving me
Not being there whenever I need you
The bullshit
The embarassment
All that
Even after all that
I would never let a single thing happen to you
I still love you and it's a shame...
That you don't feel the same way

[Verse:]
Pull the trigger
Hollow tip
Blow my mind like an acid trip
Fearful of death but I think I lost my will to live
Can't speak to people bout my problems
They don't need to know about my drama
I can't even tell my fucking momma
The boy with the broken heart
Walking round with a pain in his chest
Trying his best but still popping pills before the day even start
Numbing the pain because it's just too hard
Fuck a 9 to 5
This music shit is all I got
Moving on, hoping
I don't get forgot
Take a hit of this blunt
Bet god watches me in disgust
I think I need some advice
Still giving in to my vice
Still searching for what's right
Put that fucking hollow tip through my brain and watch me take flight
I'm a fallen angel escaped from the afterlife
I'm alive but inside I feel dead
You can see it in my eyes I mean every word I ever said

[Joselito Torres:]
You think I did that shit on purpose nigga?
You fucking piss me off
