[Verse 1]
As I lay in bed
Eyes heavier than lead
I wanna finish life
But it's had to get ahead
Get a head start, you gotta jump your heart
So get the cables ready
And tell me when to start
The only time she said we'd be apart was when I died
But our ways parted, and here I am, still alive
I wondered if you'd ever see me live again
But all this shit happened, you won't see me again
Unless it's at my funeral, everyone's invited
Everything went wrong and you're just trynna right it
I hate it when we fight
Shit gets awkward
When I'm in Atlanta this shit feel Hawkward
(Laughs) Get it? Atlanta Hawks
Our love was a fairy tale, jack and the beanstalk
We knew it was there, but no one else believed it
I guess it's true, ya gotta see it to believe it
Uh, this is the life I wanna live
Rappin' 'bout the past, and the fucks I don't give
Also make amends, forgive and forget
I want your forgiveness
But I don't, so forget it

[Verse 2]
Would they miss me if I was gone?
If I didn't release a song?
Would she think twice about not waiting so long
To tell me how she feel, and to tell me what's real
Instead of feeding me lies to keep my hopes up high
I, wish I hadn't fucked a good thing up
But if I hadn't fucked up, would I still be fucked up?
That's a question only I would know
9 girls trippin', man it's time to go
I hit the studio, and let out all my emotions
But there ain't no controllin'
Me when I'm in these moods
Cause that's when I get my depression like attitude
You say I'm bein' rude, but the demons are takin' over
I need some luck, like a four leaf clover
I wish that I was normal, not depressed
I wish "God" would stop putting me through these fucking tests
Should I end it all?
It's a question that comes to mind
And I store it away
And say it's for another time
Would anybody cry if I just slit my wrists?
Don't shed tears for me
I'm just a fuckin' piece of shit

[Verse 3]
Ya say the sky's the limit
Well I just hit the roof
Ya say my shit's good
Well let me see the proof
Are you just saying this shit so I don't do something stupid?
These thoughts are in my head and it feels like they're loopin'
Why do ya come at me and say I'm a lost cause?
Sorry I'm not jolly all the time like Santa Claus
But ya actin like a bad dog, from where ya got your paws
Don't try to bring other people in our private shit
Don't tell him I'm the one you're arguin' with
I don't feel like getting an everyday lecture
Honey you were sweet until I got your nectar
You got lots of pleasure
From throwin' me around, like a beat up sweatshirt
This ain't architecture, it's way more complex,
I'm on to the next so get out of the picture.
