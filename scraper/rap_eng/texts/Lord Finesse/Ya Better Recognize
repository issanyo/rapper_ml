[Verse 1: Lord Finesse]
Uh, let the games begin, man, I play to win
I floss them jewels with gems, got dimes you can't spin
Got shit hemmed, why you wildin' I'm smilin'
Profilin', shinin' like a medallion
Worshipped by thousands as the nicest, most righteous
Game's priceless, I call it like psychics
So foes that's mad, better show some class
I got that dough to stash, watch me show my ass
You know the half, well, guess you don't
And get paid by now, shit, guess you won't
You's on a thin rope, I get respects like the pope
Got it locked like a vote, I do my thing then I bolt
No joke, be the villain in black coats
Fuck LEGOs when I was young I was taught to stack notes
That's all she wrote, I gotta keep starter
I show you flossing ain't over for y'all niggas that got teeth problems

Check it, check it out for those that know me
(You better recognize) Don't know? Better ask around
You know the deal I represent skills
Rap without Finesse is like life without oxygen

[Verse 2: Lord Finesse]
Be the ghetto icon, type don you're all hyped on
Blowing like pipe bombs, money long like pythons
Even without the ice on, you still feel me
Make you ill willies look goofy like hill billies
Real silly, you kill me, for the fact that others suck me and grill me
Really, kinda ill see, quit startin
Cause I roll with a squadron
That stays in trouble like Dennis Rodman
Names spreads like margarine, be the next to rise
Understand rule 1 kid; recognise
I don't stress you guys, you weasels
Me and my peoples is diesels, plus we keep it kosher like the hebrews
Let's see who wins the game here, cause I'm holding
While you barely got train fare, the way I'm rolling
Can make the dames stare, could go the round, blow your town
Till the day I die, Finesse'll be holdin it down

[Verse 3: O.C.]
Let me introduce my- aww fuck it, y'all know me
O.C., the kid with the gold teeth
(?????) in me, I shine
I find no crime, maybe criminal thoughts on my mind
Sure you write, boy I write rhymes all night
I tip it in my LS on the turnpike
On my own, stay home, shorty alone
Forty and gold that make me wanna stroke my bone
Watch you fall, you wonder why I'm packing for
Cause niggas on the streets is like Dracu-law
Vernacular, smooth like an Acura
Main man pretty tough, but I smacked your whore
I been blessed since birth to recite these verses
Dropping rhymes on ya domes like bird shits
When I step in the place and get nervous
I'm kicking the ass, it's what the herds get
