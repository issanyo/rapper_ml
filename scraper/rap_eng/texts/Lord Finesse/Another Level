Femme Fatale Marquee
Without Furter Do
Check it out

Verse 1 (Marquee)

Marquee
Femme one fatale
In the belly nine months
Then I birthed a style
All that boss talk
Look, you a worker now
Guess things with your business
Ain't working out
Dudes 'round my way
Dress up to get robbed
Outside next day same spot
Like it's no prob
Call the police, hide on the roof
Blaze at the squad car
Grimy niggas
Six baby mothers and no job
Hustle all week
Get a pair of Jordans
Jordan wouldn't put a center in the hood
If you paid for it for him
Make it rain, make it pouring
Watch niggas get to brawling
Come through the block
In couple drops that's foreign
Ruthless sweats and cornrows
Sling blade like Zorro
While you porno looking heifers
Stay slave to your hormones
Ten bitches coming at me
Ten ditches I'm digging
Impose choke holds, blockage
Airway constricted
No mercy, no restrictions
Zero fucks is given
Mind got tunnel vision
Unleashing a ass-whipping
No big pimping over here
Pretty women in fly gear
Mommy chulos, ebony beauties
Cuties you find rare
Another level everything
Ain't nobody getting spared


Anotha anotha (Marquee)
"flows to another level" (scratches)
"Whatch it how it goes" (scratches)
Another level take me to another level (Frsh Aire)

Verse 2

Marquee rugged delicate
My presence is evident
Rhetoric I combat
With poetic bars of excellence
Don't ask me why they relevant
Check your point of reference
Regiment of perfectionist rhymes
Collecting presidents
Broke brawds
Only way you get money
From a settlement
Weak is what you represent
Keeping the people hella bent
Wanting something more
Rap got a speech impediment
At peak I'm in my element
Blessed odes
From the heaven sent
More valuable than a old
Family's inheritance
Sass and persona
Hashtag, it's over
Works like a piece of art
Contained at the Moma
No box you can fit me in
Soul of a musi-ci-an
Jump on tracks through loops
Like an Olympian
It's bigger than me
Higher than the hottest degree
Scorch a Symphony
Orchestrated song dont miss a beat
Chicks be fake like prosthetics
Phony sounds pathetic
Ain't got a leg to stand on
Cuz the standard I set it
Headed to another level
Increasing exponential
Spots, I'm taking several
Above heights
Beyond celestial


Anotha anotha
"flows to another level" (scratches)
