One time for your mind, here we go (Here we go).  You know
My style, now peep the flow (Peep the flow, hon)
Girl, I know you’re with it, so drop your seven digits
Got a minute, then let me know (Let me know)
One time for your mind, here we go (Here we go).  You know
My style, now peep the flow (Know my style)
Girl, I know you’re with it, so drop your seven digits
Got a minute, then let me know (Let me know)

[Verse 1: Lord Finesse and (Marquee)]
Shorty got it going on.  (Is that so?  Who you be?)
I’m a slick type of nigga that like to lounge on the low
(I be seeing you around).  That’s all dead, huh.  I just
Swing and do my thing and lay low like the Feds
Straight up real, no scam.  (So where)
(Your girl at?)  Probably out with your man
(Yeah, yeah, that rapping is nice)
My macking’s precise, I’m on you like a tracking device
Forget a crew, I got solo tactics.  I ain’t
A half-ass nigga—baby, I got the total package
I never fronted, you can get it if you want it
Won’t say I’m the best, but I’m not that far from it
You know my style.  (You like to play low, you probably be going)
(“Downtown.”)  Okay, if you say so
Give me a minute and it’s over.  I’m one
Bad soldier, I was flexing before Mad Cobra
I got so much charm, even if you with
Your moms, huh, I play it cool like the Fonz
Whether weekends, Monday through Friday, I know this ain’t
Burger King, but I’ll still have it my way

[Verse 2: Lord Finesse and (Marquee)]
Oooh, shorty’s got it going on.  (Who you be?)
A roughneck living for ‘95 and beyond
(I see you playing around the field).  Yeah, I used
To stick and move, now I just lounge and chill
I’m not the type to be sweating crazy.  (I need)
(A real man).  Shit, I’m as real as you get, baby
My game is outstanding.  (I got)
(A boyfriend).  Yeah?  Well, now you got a man friend
(Oh, it’s like that?)  Is you kidding?  Shit, I got
So much game, I could make a nun change religions
I got flavors like a rainbow, you dig what I’m saying?
(Yeah, tuh, that shit is all game, though)
Come on, I know you like it.  Don’t
Front on me, I’ll read your whole card like a psychic
(Yeah, you got clout).  No doubt, plus I’m getting money
Ain’t a brother out teaching when I’m kicking, honey
I’m like Silk and H-Town, can you dig it?
I’ll lick you up and down and knock your boots in a minute
Messing with me, nothing but good can happen
And there’s a new sheriff in town.  (Really, where?)  You’re looking at him

[Verse 3: Lord Finesse and (Marquee)]
I’m not the type to act a fool, catching brothers with a tool
I’ll just bag up skins, I’ll play it cool
I kick game, I’ll have your mind eased ‘cause I could be
Bummy and nappy-headed and still pull a Dom P
(Pimping is hard) Not to me.  You got a
Lot to see the way I put skins under lock and key
And let ‘em front the role like they out-
-standing, huh, I’ll leave ‘em out, standing in the cold
A girl act up, then I cut her off,  (Is your)
(Game smooth?)  Is it?  My shit’s butter-soft
So won’t y’all just hear me in.  (Why’s that?)
I get girls open like a Cesarean
Yo, I’ll roll with the big menm and I don’t have to
Trick ends and mess around just to get skins
So all y’all niggas that’s geese, I could make that shit
Cease when I slide up in the peace
