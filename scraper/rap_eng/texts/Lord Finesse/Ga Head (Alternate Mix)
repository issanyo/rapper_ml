[Verse 1]
Yo, you tell too many lies for me, I'm hip to ya, screw ya
One time or another see I thought that I knew ya
I brought ya to a level that you would never ever see
O-C-double-E toasted bubbly treatin you lovely so
What be the cause of you seein another man
Didn't I tell you stop hangin out with that hoe Fran
She's bad news, plus she's the cause of my blues
You act as if she's the man buyin you garments and shoes
Whassup with that? C'mon baby doll, explain to me
I gotta know, what's the effin reason for playin me?
His sha-laft must be thick, must be stronger
Must be good, must be a whole lot longer
If not that, then yo, I don't know
You get a award for the best actress playin a role
Your one last chance to advance with me
Sittin quiet on your ass why don't you answer me?
I guess not so

[Hook]
Go 'head with yourself - you stabbed my heart with a knife
Go 'head with yourself - I thought you was my wife
Go 'head with yourself - you're nuttin but stress in my life
Go 'head with yourself

[Verse 2]
It's killin me softly, awfully, my heart aches
Over you breaks for you, bound to the stakes for you
Knowin the next man drillin ya fillin your holes
With flesh to flesh, smackin the mattress to sweat
In love juice, that's how I imagine the whole hoo-rah
I try to block it out so I pick the Qu'ran
To act as if I'm readin but I'm not
Then I get a call from my nigga Ness blowin up the spot
He's tellin me some shit I can't take grips to
I flips on the phone, but it's him I shouldn't be riffin to
BLAM! Slammed the phone down, shocked as a mother
What I discovered, it made me sob and blubber
All my time was a waste, my face it looked just like a jackass
I leave it up to my cloud to decide
Should I blast her for causin me emotional hell
Or let her go 'head with herself

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3]
Check it
Now I know, remember the ho I spoke about named Fran?
She be the other man, hey ain't that some..
She did a switch to go down on a bitch
Had me thinkin another man changed her pitch
Another woman's been beatin my time
Another sister not a mister she lovin mine
I confronted who was once my honey
To see why she chose over the raw and real to lick
Tail of a bunny, all of a sudden I explode in rage
Of animalistic like I broke out of a cage
First I think violence, then I think the uppercut into her gut
For what? There's other honies out there so what the..
.. just my luck though
Or that I streak a bad vibe in the system over a missus
You got vicious, so best wishes
Let's just say the world is a ocean filled with mad fishes
Malicious be your attitude, sour be your name like
Lickin other kitten but you say you feel shame
Game kill it, you're not attracted to men
So my advice is to take a hike witcha new friend

[Hook] - 2X
