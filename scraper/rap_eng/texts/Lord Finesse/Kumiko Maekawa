[Verse]
Big Grizz got heat like Kumiko Maekawa
Destroying the competition like I was Bowser
Speed kick game strong and it got power
Bar game knock you down like a set of towers
I ain't coming hard but best believe that i'm steady
My squad will knock your block off I hope that you're ready
Chilling like a boss like i'm Fab Five Freddy
Driving circles 'round the game like i'm Richard Petty
To all of my haters, and all of my foes
I hope that you come correct if you go
To battle
With Skull Reaper Grizz, get it how you live
Cause ain't nobody realer than me and that's Biz
Cause homie don't you notice i'm the marquee?
I'll break you down have you praying to a Jesus piece
Give your girl that TLC, then I go and creep
Then meet up again and swing a ep in my Jeep
Who's really hot now? Who's really burning down the circuit?
I'll play your whole squad make y'all look like a circus
I made a big dent y'all just barely scratched the surface
Kintsugi tape a pot of gold if you heard it
Hip 2 Da Game since 1996
You ain't heard a VA rapper who is realer than this
Rep the 757 about every single day
I live a good life and i'm proud to say
I'm a top notch veteran
Ballin' AD like a Pelican
Failed once more press your luck again
And everyone know who I am
If you didn't know you will know again
Japanese chick she's petite and a tomboy
Turning up the temperature just to make it hot boy
And as far as my crew, they got me
Standing in my corner like Tomoko Watanabe
Bars too spicy like you eating up wasabi
You can catch me chilling while i'm sipping on some Sake
AriZona and a bag of gold
Take trips with me know I got lyrics to go
And yes i'm the future so don't even trip
You never seen a real rapper quite like this
You know I'm going postal I don't need any help
I look like a champ with that big red belt
