Check it out, for those that know me
Ya wonder why I always play low key
I know I got people and fans that like me
But all the noise and attention don't excite me
So I just lounge and play the D.L
In the crib with just me and a female
I'm still slick besides the others
Cause a nigga like me, yo, I'm smoother than the Isley Brothers
When I'm on the scene I get feedback
Brothers runnin up (Wassup, where you be at?)
I be by myself just coolin
Cause I don't have no time to sweat what someone else is doin'
Cause they're not equal to me
I got places to go, money to make, and people to see
Whatcha gonna do? The man is comin through
(You a bad mother fucker) Ey yo, that ain't nothin new
Now I'm makin' higher figures
You got dumb mother fuckers who always wanna try a nigga
But I'm wildin at Harlem, kid
I'm straight makin papes, so what the mother fuckin problem is?
Ya talk about unity. When I turn my back
You talkin bout what ya wanna do to me
But y'all can keep riffin
I'ma send ya home with ya mother fuckin teeth missin
So stop runnin at the mouth
Straight up and down, yo you know what I'm about

[Chorus]
Knockin niggas off
Knockin niggas out
Knockin niggas off
Knockin niggas out
You know what I'm about

It's the man with the rough flow
Some niggas don't like me, but I don't give a fuck though
Cause I'm a command y'all
I'm smackin' niggas up like Puerto Ricans play handball
I ain't the funny type
That joke around, I gotta get my mother fuckin money right
And I got the right game
I'm definitely the wrong man to invite to a dice game
I'm rollin' numbers with no practice
I'm snatchin' up the money like mother fuckers owe taxes
And I got strategy
I'm rollin head cracks, trips, and makin all the brothers mad at me
And I'm taxin' shit
I'm shittin' on niggas like I just had a laxative
Tryin' to gain props, I ain't the one to see
You clowns'll fuck around and get played like a drum machine
You gotta find a better way
I pull your cards, your file, shit, plus your résumé
Cause I don't play clown
I'm tryin to get mine, that's why my face stay frown
I don't smile or try to pull my file
I lay your ass like towel, you know my mother fuckin style
So just slow down, cause y'all can't throw down
And y'all can't accept that a brother's makin dough now
And I'm livin better, true
Cause I makin more noise than a fuckin' heavy metal group
It's the cool man, brother with the smooth plan
And I'm seeing more papers than a newstand
So peep it, don't try to run around and speak it
Point blank that keep my whereabouts secret
While brothers is packin still, actin ill
I'm on the D.L., with a female, and I'm stackin bills
(How ya livin?) Yeah I'm livin swell
Cause a nigga like me, yo I'm ringin bells
Without doubt, I got clout
Yo, fuck that shit, you know what I'm about

[Chorus]
