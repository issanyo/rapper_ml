[Intro]

[Hook]
It's like that y'all check it out now
(Yeah Yeah, now check the method) x4

[Verse 1: Mwenya]
I'm a beast, an animal; Feast on MC's like a cannibal
It's not my fault that they walk into my mandibles
Flow intangible, untouchable; God Particles
I'm not a God MC but I'm definitely spiritual
I'm indubitable, sick but not curable
Dr. Dre fucked up with my pharmaceuticals
I miss the doobies dude, life was beautiful
Back when my hair kept it shaggy like Scooby Doo
And who are you to judge the life I live?
I see my future like it's tatted on my inner eyelids
I'm not violent but I kill with silence
That's kindness, I give an inch and they take a mileage
I bust a rhyme like a leader of the new school
And I'm on point like A-T-C-Q tip, top shape
Bitch I bring the bass like a fucking earthquake, Wayne

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mwenya]
So now it's verse 2, you know I'm finna spit like perfume
Shhht Shhht, if you want you could learn too
I got that verbal that emotionally burn you
Make a grown man write it down in his journal (It was a nightmare)
And I won't stop
I never started from the bottom like some flip flops
They say Hip Hop is dead, well I'm a fucking Zombie
Keep it classy like I'm wearing Fitch & Abercombie
And I'm connected like Wi-Fi, even though I'm old school like tie-dye
I'm still fly like Sci-Fi, and Imma stay at your neck like a tight tie
It's simple, people pop champagne I pop pimples
I'm eighteen with a great dream and a sick instrumental
And I feel myself like blind men
Cause I'm breaking boundaries, like that hymen
So what more can I say?
I kill shit like an assassin, I should get paid
And I'm only a signing away
So Lord Finesse please just take it away

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lord Finesse]
It's like that y'all, and I keep figures
It's the hardcore ruffneck funky type of street nigga
Lord Finesse got the swift rap
And you don't need Dionne Warwick and them psychic friends to predict that
In years to come I'm bound to shine
Give me a mic and a minute, I'll show niggas I get down for mine
Word life, you know the haps
Fucking with me is like bungee jumping with no rope attached
Man listen, I got plenty rhymes
When it comes to props, motherfuckers just oughta gimme mine
Word, cause I slay ya fast
Whether you're the best MC with a mic, or you're straight up trash
My lyrics excel, hops
From the ghetto streets upstate to motherfucking cell blocks
No doubt I got clout (Word)
I gotta give a shout (To who?) To my brother Show when I'm out
