[Intro]
Coming straight from the ill
Yeah,yeah
Uh-huh,uh-uh

Feel like my past is nothing but


[Verse 1:Ray Jets]
I use to be a crook
Fly nigga laying chicks in my nest
Lifestyle alcoholic
Had me flirting with death
To rap the dream from 15
Current target for disbelief
Ray Jets the chaser
I mean excavator
The way I dig up words
Memories purge perfect on the paper
Regrets I try lay to waste
Flashbacks keep an awful rage
Black clouds contain the pain
Probably why I can't stand the fucking rain
Fools gold,rainbows was the mind I possessed
Impostor Love
They never want to fess' the threats
Some Chinese whispers
Indirects
Fake they claim
When you speak off the chest
There's no depth to you slackers straight empty heads
Inevitably
Ima' be tripling my money multiplying my enemies
Secondly
Cutting off next heads who want to try question me
Ray, I'm on a different energy

[Hook]
Rain drops
Always seems to stain
Bad memories into veins
Damn I'm so sick of the pain,pain
I'm just hoping, I'm just hoping
That I win this ticket today, day, day





[Verse 2: Ray Jets]
But now I'm all black jeans and white tees
Yep
This apartheid theme got me segregated from other teens
Call my bluff this is nothing that you've ever seen
The polite ,well mannered
Sounding real mafioso
Braggadocious
Get snug with my lines
Ray Jets got you audio coking
Criminality out of the focus
Brainwaves on higher elevation
Happiness and diamond rings never far from things I'm chasing
But domestic depression is teaching my soul lessons
Life wants me out on a stretcher
I'm giving into the pressure
Cliffs right now couldn't look any hella' better
The value of on-going is getting ever harder to measure


[Hook]


[Outro]
Yeah,yeah,yeah

And it goes on and on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on and on
Life's an infinity
It goes on and on and on
Life infinity

To the sunrise to the sunset
It's Ray Jets
