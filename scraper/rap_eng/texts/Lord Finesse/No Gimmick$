[Verse 1: J.Harris]

Got an Infinite Illmatic, sporadic tags of
The crew all over your Dodge Magnum, you better
Dodge magnums when we bustin' senseless mindframe
Its nothin, my niggas menstrually-ill we'll put
Them seeds in your stomach, slight horror-core
When we come in, bum rushin, gun touchin your
Blumpkin, straight face like im bluffin
Jack-a-nigga, black pumpkins, shells drop
Like they're humpty, dump the mask grab the money
Never really head much so we turned nothin'
To somethin' (Remember eatin' ramen noodles
All day) smell like piss in the hallways
Family gettin money the wrong way, all we know
Is street life, coming in after street lights
Tryna make moves & hit licks until we get our
C's right, to brag and boast about all of the
Stuff that we got, our life is quidditch if you
Snitchin then the snitch get caught
Drugs made in Pyrex pots, the block is hot, you'll
Get popped, adjusted to the life we're livin' and
This shit never stops
