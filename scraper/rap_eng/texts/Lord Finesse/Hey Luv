Intro : (Milano)

Yeah, Milano, Cuban Links, O.C
You know how we do things
We always get our way
Ungh, never hate when we play
Know what I mean
Ungh

[Verse One: O.C.]
I only think of broads on two occasions
When I'm blazin and try to persuade 'em
To slide off with slick dialogue
We pop off a bottle of Remi, Milano got plenty
Pocket of Benji', swallowin Jimmy
Mami hot already, Poppi been heavy
Before I got signed, before I wore signs
Why the broke niggas swear they only quote dimes
Or hold minds
And made a law
?Forced into immigrant walls?
Making high calls
Like damn paso's
Ya'll ain't playa's you just keep the bench warm
Milano run through 'em, life Stephon
Get you game tight, I'm the exception
A freak when I get my sex on
Lick cheeks when the thongs come off
Whip cream with cherry Hagen Daaz
For starters we take shots with Polaroids
Runnin trizzy, call all my boys
Watchin Six get busy with a roll of toys
Still keep it low point
Standin a club up
My niggas wild and drunk
Ain't no stoppin us
From getting lots of love, puffin chocolate
On acid we got the rough
Should we locks it up?
It ain't hard to spot us
Pullin the Expo slow, tellin the hoes to pile up
No wonder on the low, niggas despise us
Cause we live'as

Chorus: (Milano)

Now when we up in the club we lookin major, hey luv
We pop puffs, cause we paid up, hey luv
Now its off to my crib for a night cap, straight up
Forgot the small talk ma we just wanna lay up
(2x)

Verse 2: (Cuban Link)

Yea, stick the pretty up
Poppa stopped by the titty clubs
Pimpin ain't easy like the shit I did with ?Willie Stubbs?
Really love
Money, power and respect
Honey that fuck for hours in bed
Sex in the showers the best
Check out the body banger
The hottest Pocahontas, she's probably danger
I'm not a stranger
To the game so I'm throwing change up
My willy fingers trying to figure her out
I dig her style, I'ma find out what this chick is about
Fuck the foul chickens, I need a money makin honey
A playboy bunny
That doesn't want nuthin from me
Its funny how she's one of a kind
From front and behind, top of the line
Dimepiece, bright as the sunshine
My kinda lady, maybe
Drives me crazy, like Miss Daisy
The wake she shakes her acey
Makes me wanna taste her pastry
Maybe its the liquor talking
Cause I don't whisper often
A simple kiss, will have her grab my wrist, and wishin she was closin
This is more than just a portion
Of my lifestyle my right brow
Took her to my crib, and put the lights out

Chorus

Verse 3: (Milano)

Ungh, listen ma
Its only certain ones
That get to slurpin on my tongue
Worstened by some
Hurtin them buns
Workin it luv
Shit is worst when I'm numb
Any hottie
Is getting back shotties
It'll probably be hours before
I seem twisted from the Bacardi on
If they party on
Like its Mardi Gras
Brought the camcorders along
Ladies, time to flaunt on
Get the hunny, pour it on
Lickin your buddy, I saw it all
Recorded it all
So if you wanna be on that at all
Got the baddest broads
Lockin they jaws
Never cockin it raw
I'm not the aids type for blotches or sores
I'm getting paid right, watch for them frauds
Even my chains ice nigga, alotta's the call
Some slice whores, I see 'em coming
Its like once you pluck, you got 'em pregnant or somethin
For those they hunger
Trying to trap dudes
See I get my woman bashful
Freak on the low, on natural
Bank account on cash rules
Thats an example, so while I'm tappin your womb
I'm laughin at you
Spending your loot, on casual
Jewels, and shoes
Don't act the fool
Like your screws loose
I ain't to blame
See she wasn't tame
And I ain't even have to drop game
Born to rock game
Milan', when my crews involved, its how we swang
This is how we swang

Chorus

Outro: (Cuban Link)

Lay up, lay up
Straight up, straight up
Ungh, ungh, ungh
