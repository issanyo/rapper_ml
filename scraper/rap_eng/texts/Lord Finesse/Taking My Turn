Verse 1:

If Hip-Hop's a game, I'm takin' my turn
I came to place your face in the dirt, name in the Earth
The way I confirm the game's in a 180 reverse
White people have the balls to say the "n-word"
Am I crazy disturbed? Or am I greatly concerned?
I know, I'm pissed they makin' changes for worse
No danger alert, it fucking painfully hurts
Like I'm sittin' here feelin' a blue flame to a burn!
Let me laymen the terms, it's like grabbin' a knife
Going to an open show n' start attackin' the mic
Everyone starts crying as you hack and you slice
Sad show, but deep down you're laughin' inside
Could you imagine the sight? a cold blooded murder
The weapon of choice but knowin' nothin' further
No suspect, no blood shed, abundance of nothin'
All you know is they were comin' for somethin'

Verse 2:

It's like I've been waiting for the day I defeat
The crazy flamin' dragon beast, who claims to be king
Takin' the crown, put your face in the ground
Rise to the throne, no weighin me down
In this mind of my own
Time to unfold
I'm breakin' the chains, I'm breakin' the news
A broke motherfucker who's been payin' his dues
Makin' the moves
Replacin' the ways erasin' debates
On the individual who's been makin' the change
I ain't takin' no breaks, I hustle my ass
By runnin' these laps I'm makin' sure I'm never comin' in last
Runnin' for first, a back pack n' a buncle of words
A long way cause I'm still comin' from under the dirt
I'm persistent n' driven with this privilege I live with
Shit on every critic who gives sits n' gives this a listen
Go fuck yourself, are you missin' the image?
Your opinion's no difference I ain't afraid to admit it
I'm out
