Letra de "Brainstorm/P.S.K. (Remix)"

[Verse 1: O.C.]
It’s like me against
Anyone, first full verse is spontaneous
Combustion thrusts me, no rapper can dust me
Bounced upon the scene with a theme, Word...Life
I cut fantasy out ‘cause I differ from a dream
Wisdom lies deep in my molecules, you assumed
I fell victim to hip hop blues—you’re way
Off, I stay on tour often, rocking spots on
The California coast, ranging on back to Boston
Enforcing my theory, leaving rappers teary-eyed
Fry most who came and thought they had stride
You accustomed to cussing and bluffing, fussing for nothing
Half of y’all crumbs are just soft like muffins, I bake
Masterpieces, sharper thesis. Y’all
Candy-coated motherfuckers stink like feces
Needless to say, are these running shoes yours?
You retreated when I gave out hit for wars
My microphone set is immensely brick-wall
Solid in and out. You slept, so now snore
Who got my back? You ask Lord and Blastmaster
Unorthodox, combinations from the masters
Mics I menace. When it’s finished, you get
An understanding of what we’re bringing: no gimmicks

[Hook: Samples and Lord Finesse]
“Release the brainstorm to make something kind of lyrical”
“Blowing up spots from state to state”

Finesse is coming to town
“But you just can’t wait“

[Verse 2: Lord Finesse]
My decision is
Precision, I’m ill in ways you can’t vision
I got niggas worshipping Lord Finesse like religion
You can’t fuck around—you’re kidding. You don’t want no
Collision? You better fly South like a pigeon
Good riddance. I’ll flip flows you can’t imagine
I’ll break down your Flintstone style into fragments
So pay attention to the man rapping, don’t
Think that it can’t—I’m living proof it can happen
I’ll reign supreme logical, verbally
I drop it in ways that you never dreamed possible
So lyrically, I personally figure
That my Harvard style is too deep for you nursery niggas
When I clutch the mic, I’m coming rough and right
I build more than them workers on construction sites
I’m skilled at it, I’m Illmatic
So “yes” answers your question if you ask me: do I still have it?
I’m the realest, the illest coming
Out the woodworks like them homos in the Village
But, seriously, I got the remedy. If I was at the
Bottom of the toilet, you niggas still couldn’t shit on me
Originally, it’s the same the vet. I’m on that
Get-rich list, but they didn’t call my name yet
I’ll make it special like a prom night, I’ll bomb mics
While other brothers are old news like Walter Cronkite
It’s critical. You got these Xerox individuals
But, word life, it ain’t nothing like the original
I’ll wreck kids—that’s my theory and perspective
When it comes to hip hop, I’m on the case like detectives
You better step to the next man
‘Cause the greatest soccer player couldn’t kick it like Finesse can

[Hook: Samples and KRS-One]
“Release the brainstorm to make something kind of lyrical”
“Blowing up spots from state to state”

The Teacha’s coming to town
“But you just can’t wait“

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
This is
The scientific, extra-prolific, terrific, mystic
Simplistic, metaphysic, no gimmick type lyric
When you hear it or hear me running through the scrimmages
You see images affecting your sight to make
You go, “Yo, there he is! No, there he is!” No, here
He is, rocking your superiors in your hardest
Areas, your lyrical skills are inferior
It’s because your video that they cheer for ya. I’ll take
Care of ya quickly ‘cause I cannot take it
Your weak head needs to be deca-
-pitated ‘cause you fake it. If your heart
Was caffeine, well, you’re now decaffeinated
You’ll scream “battle,” but it’s the end of your
Career. You anticipate it, I hate it
Career ended, how splendid
For wack emcees, I come doctor-recommended

[Hook: Samples]
“Release the brainstorm to make something kind of lyrical”
“A strange form, something kind of lyrical”
“Blowing up spots from state to state”

[Outro: KRS-One]
Haha! You know what’s up when Lord Finesse up in the piece. All you wack ass rappers better go rewrite your album. O.C. in the house, KRS in the house. Yeah, New York style in the house, yeah. BDP crew in the house, yeah!
