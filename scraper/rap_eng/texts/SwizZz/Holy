[Intro]
He won't
Yep

[Verse 1]
Maybe I should listen to 'em
Maybe they know what's best
Maybe a resume's needed for where I am headed
I don't know yet
Stressed but I am blessed
[?] roll on the top
Then I turn her ass over like I throw the ball away
Ball away, she take it all away
Can I get a follow on the Gram? Damn
Can I get a milly for the plan? Damn
Can I get a drummer for the band? Damn
Can you shake it harder for the cam? Damn
Always emotion, the silence is golden
The energy's flowing, the vision unfolding
Invade like a Trojan, cause shit like I'm Logan
No [?] in the army we rowing

[Chorus]
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy, holy, nigga
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, Rollie, hardly ever home
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy, holy, nigga
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, Rollie, hardly ever home

[Verse 2]
Nope, I'll build you up just to break you down
They can never duplicate the sound
Better flow by leaps and bounds
Fairy tales when I'm not around
Didn't get to wear a cap and gown
Mad strapped, I really run the town
Probably fit to go fifty rounds
Make way, mayday now
Spit like AK bloah
Bet they obey, bow
Tip their hat [?], yeah
Swagger got badder
People talk shit but does that really matter?
Storming your castle while waving my batter
Sever your team, body parts on a platter
Ego gets bigger, his pockets get fatter
Study the move, I just follow the pattern
Pleasure or pain, I found home in the later
[?] took a toll on my bladder
She like to flirt but I'm really not flattered
[?] put a lid on the chatter
Forgive my poor manners, the world on bananas
I [?] the beat [?], I'm gone

[Verse]
Maybe I should listen to 'em
Maybe they know what's best
Maybe a resume's needed for where I am headed
I don't know yet
Stressed but I am blessed
[?] roll on the top
Then I turn her ass over like I throw the ball away
Ball away, she take it all away
Can I get a follow on the Gram? Damn
Can I get a milly for the plan? Damn
Can I get a drummer for the band? Damn
Can you shake it harder for the cam? Damn
Always emotion, the silence is golden
The energy's flowing, the vision unfolding
Invade like a Trojan, cause shit like I'm Logan
No [?] in the army we rowing

[Chorus]
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy, holy, nigga
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, Rollie, hardly ever home
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy, holy, nigga
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, Rollie, hardly ever home
