[Verse 1: SwizZz]
If I had one wish, I'd probably wish I didn't have it
I'm good to go, all I need to proceed is a beat and watch a nigga get active
I could force AI to go to practice
I'm the reason why your son is missing classes
Ditching school everyday to get layed by a babe with a booty like Stacey Dash's
Ey homie, are you ready?
Well I really don't give a shit
I'm going in like it's cold outside
Now come get right and have a sip of this
Little nigga, I'm drinking and I'm driving
Don't touch my keys you wildin'
The only nigga that will ever get in my car when not up-to-par is me
Tonight I'm ridin'
Yup, I'm a fire spitter
I can murder nigga like a snowcone sitting in the sun yo
What the fuck I need a gun for?
I'll put your ass in a headlock and slam you like a car door
I know you see the black eyes
But you don't want to leave with a black eye
Fuck around too much and you just might
I knock you out and wake you up and knock you out twice
It's really hard acting like I'm down-to-earth
When I'm high as fuck off this pound of Purp
On another planet, at a loss of words
Mumblin' on the beat cause I forgot my verse
(Mumbling...)
I'm back on track
No ? but I can put the game up on my back
And run a couple hundred miles and then sit in Iraq
Labels only want your money so I had to adapt
Went to college for three years, recorded a rap
Moved back to the valley and decided to rap
Now it's time to put my fuckin' city up on the map
Come get me, I'm ready
I kick it like Messi
No Scantron, don't test me
I'll break you, don't press me
My flow is nice like it shares with people
What's mine is yours
Your all invited, I'd love to treat you
