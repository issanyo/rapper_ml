[Verse: 1 Dopedout Lino]
Now this right here is the recipe
Showing love to Hopsin and triple Z
No fruity funky shitty music is around me. keep it G'
Till The day I D-I-E
Still deadly with them beats
Still puffing on them b's
I smoke j's too but only if it's an emergency
Bumping Pac, Hop , triple Z and eazy-e
No lil wayne around so keep your 3 peat
Now that I'm far. im stumping out my enemies with a pair of cleats
And you tell me when was the last time you heard sick lyrics coming from a teen
All my life it's been nothing but friends and family
You know we all come from sick windy city and big bad cali
From paramount all the way to the valley
Bringing ALL My fucking team
It's a possibility that I make it mainstream
So let the people know that I'm living my dream
Im considered a thief around where im from. Illi
My flow's been steaming. It's been stinging
In all of you haters head's it's been ringing
So a monster they created
Demolished and sick thoughts intimidated
My thoughts are switched up. so sometimes im loving and sometimes im very blatant
A big dawg from Chi city is just statin'
That the rap industry is just stankin'
And Mills that are being takin'
From real niggas and they just bakin'
And others just keep waitin'
If your rapping about how much your stack is filled then your time is being wasted
And your corny raps ain't even being rated
So i'll just finish off here and tell ya'll that Rap is in the makin'
