See we Funk Volume known to keep it real
Alright, alright, alright, alright

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
My nigga we gettin' straight to it and makin' the way (makin' the way)
You playin' the diz, you playin' The Veg but I'm payin' the way (I'm payin' the way)
I painted my skin, (skin) liquor all up in my face (face)
I'm sippin' on Gin, (Gin) finna take a road trip to the A
(Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up)
I'm smokin' weed, stayin' outta trouble (trouble)
How do your bubbles suttle hoppin' my shit and be knockin' my hustle?
(Right)
My nigga my Ace Hood know I hustle hard
(So what we tell 'em?) All my ambition come from my struggles
(Go)
Little nigga what's your name?
Fame and where I wanna aim
Where I wanna be with the OG's and the great first nigga puttin' on Veg with a name
That's right (Nigga that's right)
Nigga don't even try to guess who the fuck I am
Fuck your label, I don't wanna meet, I like where the fuck I am!
(Go)
For really my niggie they sayin' that "Dizzy, that nigga be goin' too hard"
But it's fuckin' a lie, it's fuck your life nigga, they will take your art (take your art, take your art)
Uh, can't do it if I'm not the man
Sign me up and then lock me in
Locked and learned but nigga I got the fans
So what I tell 'em?

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
YEAH, weeelll NO...
Yo, I'm living fine without a major deal
(How?)
We built a fanbase, that is fucking real!
(Wow!)
I'd rather die before I compromise
So don't expect me to give up my rights to sign a dotted line!
(That's real!)
Bitch, better back up, don't waste any of my time
I'm plannin' to bust in a condominium to hang a corporate nigga to the ceiling by a suit and tie
I do not comply and do not conform
Proceed if you want to but you have been warned
Set up a meeting or schedule a date, if the offer is bogus you will get ignorreeedddd
(Yep!)
Extension like a cord bitch
Ball that contract up and toss it 'cause you can't afford SwizZz
Or Dizz, or Hop, suck and swallow four cocks
Funk Volume got you rattled like a door stop!
I'll pick it back up for a minute now pause and take a flick
My eyes are black and my towels' orange and we hotbox in this damn whip
I got juice all in my cup, I've got work all in my mind
Indie livin', we out here killin', keep your fucking hands off mine!
Hengh!

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
First of all I don't need none of your money, I don't need your bitches either (bitches either)
'Cause I get my own every time I spit this ether (ether)
And I'm leavin' ya'll clueless
Like "Who is this nigga comin' out the blue with a new hit?
I thought he was stew after Ruthless
But he made a comeback, how does he do this!?" (Wow!)
Don't nobody know but me
I'm where I'm supposed to be
My flow's supreme, I'm livin' life most folks would dream
And I go so hard I could coach your team bitch (Bitch)
Now who the fuck wanna join? (Join)
Me, SwizZz and Dizzy make sluts wanna "Oi" (Yeah)
Let me stop playin' I'mma rush to the point
Major labels you can take an uppercut to the groin (Oh)
So where were you last year? Or the year before?
Hmm, now you wanna sign me 'cause everybody wanna hear me more
Ya'll didn't give a fuck when I nearly poor
When I gave you my demo you were clearly bored
And now you want a nigga to give you his whole life and soul, well okay it's right here my Lord
Please take it! (Please take it)
It's a cold ass world, that's why I don't ever wanna sleep naked (Naked)
Funk Volume is up in this bitch, damn right motherfucker, we made it
Ha! No, thanks to you
Niggas knew I never step up in the game to lose
Take a look at my resume I done paid my dues I laugh at your record label while you sang the blues
Come on!
