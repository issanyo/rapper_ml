[Verse 1 - ATM]
Mellas say fuck me cause I don't do features
I'm killing the game while they watch on the bleachers
I'm realer than preachers, become a believer
The Redefiners be the truth not deceivers
Know that they need us, no one gonna beat us
I'm ATM boy and I'm one of the leaders
Original yes I be rocking Adidas
Murder the track and I hunt in a pack
No Rattpack but I'm spitting that crack
Chiraq with a dope fiend sittin' in the back
Smoking our music they just might abuse it
Mentality's sellin' the dopest of flows
Got em' addicted at all of our shows
And they screaming our name but that just how it goes
Wonder why the mix-tape say we chosen
With no management and no label, just pure fan base and we stable
Getting that buzz up we ain't on the cable
I sit at the table, my bible and fable
The king of the world like my name wasn't able
Imma be the leader cause they just ain't able
No passage, blue print ain't working
Better get yo bars up boy I'm lurking
Pay attention, just bitching, pure tension
Competition,just ambition, listen
Underground mainstream, confliction, extension
Bet I get my mention, got so much flow I don't need a rinsing
World in my hands I bet it come missing
ATM boy I'm on that mission, Redefiners on that fucking mission

[Hook - Mentality & ATM]
My membrane is missin', I lost myself and I know
They say I'm a demon, possess the beat and just flow
Young and ambitious so fuck all your riches ya heard
We spit it so vicious the music we make is absurd
Nahhh, they don't like me anyways
Nahhhhh, they don't like me anyways
Young and ambitious so fuck all your riches ya heard
We spit it so vicious the music we make is absurd

[Verse 2 - Mentality]
What are these noises, that I'm hearing up in my head?
They tellin' me to fuck the entire world or else I'm better left off for dead
I'll Listen, a mission, a vision, a given, my mind is becoming a prison
Because my lord savior is no longer risen, pray you will listen
Something so different, so vivid, I know i am gifted
I dont know how you could uphold this whole image
I'm breaking the limit so no on can visit
You say you explicit then I am exquisite, yep
Elegant dressed in whatever, the elements coming together
Relevant and will endeavor, we're prevalent cause we are better!
What's poetic what is lyrical? Is this  world even spherical?
Psychadelics are spiritual but I think Imma need a miracle
To break apart, break apart
And drift away, drift away
Someone is telling me I shouldn't go, something is telling me I shouldn't stay
Lyrical maniac, spiritual brain-attatched
Keepin my name in-tact, just for you
They say we gonna blow in a matter of time and I say god damn I bet that's true!
I was never free, I was never real, what's the point if I can't make you feel
We overdosing on sex appeal, and I'm commin' up to change all that still

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - SwizZz]
3 Z's and I'm sicker than most
Got jack and I'm ready to toast
Root beer kush ready to flow
It's easy to cope after a bit of tokes
So I'm on it yeah oh shit we hitting notes
When it's on the line I don't choke
When she's on her knees she might choke
Ambition is lovely,  you must be hungry
I drop shit like I'm clumsy
You little niggas cannot touch me
If it's fuck me then its fuck you
X that it's I love you
Without you there's no me, so that hatin shit you must do
Your next move might be your last, I run up and strangle you with a shopping bag
Then put your dead body up in a shopping bag
Then bury you under your grandparent's pad (what) shut up (what) shut up
That's 2 for the slow niggas
Get more niggas to roll with you, cuz who you got will not cut it
Fuck it, I'm bucking, Tampa Bay
You can't delay my time to rape this fucking game
I'm snatching change, crack your frames, I can't be tamed
It can't be stopped so don't try it (don't)
My membrane is hiding and I cannot find it
I hope you don't mind it, I am a little off
