[Intro]
SwizZzzzzzzzzzzzz!

[SwizZz]
Huh yo I recommend you shut your gullet
I see that your drunk but you still sound foolish
Here's a heads up if you don't quickly pull it you'll get hit from the blind side Sandra Bullock
No bullshit no bias
I'm at a point now where I can't be complient
You stomped on the foot of a mothafucking giant
And now that I'm up I only have one raw assignment(Kill)
Hot roger all day romper
Midnight monster I am here to conquer
Most of you niggas can't even fathom what I conjure
You fucking homos know nothing bout honor!
Shoot I may not but I stay fly
Yellow diamonds in my ear when I'm pushing the M5
Blowing smoke out the windows so I let my daddy ride
Did you just say daddy? yeah nigga thats right(Fag)
ZwiS that's SwizZz spell it backwards
Black and white I'mma nappy headed cracker
No grasp hold I still got it mastered
So play by the book and this will be your last chapter(Bastard!)
Great I'm fine with that label
Since I was in a craddle I have never been playful
Some say I spit death my punchlines are fatal
A couple bars will leave a hole in you like a bagel
Or maybe even a Krispy Kreme
I slap fat niggas wear skinny jeans
I'mma true jerk if you know what I mean
I'll drive into a day care and flee the crime scene
More money more problems right?
Well I wouldn't know I barely got dough to afford a bite
Staring at dollar menus each and every night
Like can I get a cheese burger and a small fry (Sure)
Everything doesn't happen for a reason
Kids get hit by drunk drivers every weekend
Cops still profile giving niggas beatings
And politicians lie to get elected in their region
Money rules everything that will never change
Sorry Pac we will never see better days
Were being led astray by our own nation
Just look at arizona, and immigrant legislation
(Damn SwizZz you trying to run for office?)
Stop it I can give a fuck about that non-sense
I call it how I see it and this shit ain't looking pretty
These corporate mothafuckers are lucky I don't rep my city(Why?)
I organize a lynch mob and get the noose out
Tell the world that the west is the new south
And anyone who ain't down with true liberty will get hung like an ornament Christmas tree, heh!
