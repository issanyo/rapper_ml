Intro

‎
What up Fv, d.f.u.o.b 7 this ain't no competition 
SwizZz I'ma kill this beat
G $Money let's get it yeah!

Verse 1

I got a kite from the devil
With a message
I can't even read
These suicide thoughts 
From the feelings I don't need
At first it was all hype
Success here
Without knowing God
Ain't gonna be nice
What we find good
Is wrong
Could A thought make a sinner
What up 
When you're gone
I got a pure heart 
But I'm hooked on the art
With the great book
I ain't smart
Me a crook
In the dark?
I'm just trying to get better
Blood doping
Energy forever
Gotta get up out this weather
Not about the cheddar
Get out my way
You could never 
Be brother
So cold 
It's me on ice
I glow
Like neon lights
She's hot‎
Then that's my type
This my girl
Yeah that's my wife

Chorus

Blood doping
I'm just trying to get better
Blood doping
Embrace it!
I'm about to transform
I'm better
Blood doping
I'm better
Blood doping
Fuck around
I'm the new 
Trend setter

Verse 2

You ain't never gonna see 
G on a track
Thatz Dat Heat
Fuck the beat 
We on the map
I'm better than 0-9 G 
When players use to ball
In a plain white tee
I ain't never seen a G 
Rocking  G Tees
Only in TT
Premiering my new shit E3
Took some time 
To build
Going down the wrong road
I Just wanna go home 
Like ET
It ain't worth doing
If I don't get better
Run up on a wack ass
Talking about cheddar
Nowadays its about 
Who's wetter
Cool fella
Never seen a beratta
Got my well equip
Medical kit
Murder you slow
This is not a hit
Money in the bag 
Dame
Watch the kid
SwizZzle on the beat
Now this is sick

Outro

Yeah
Haha
I'm sorry
They should of never let me out
