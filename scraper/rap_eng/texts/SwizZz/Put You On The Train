[Intro: SwizZz]
Yo, yo
Three Z's nigga
Alright
Oh no
Come on, come on
Alright Facebook fans
This for you guys
You requested this
I got you, I got you
Oh my god, oh my god

[Verse 1: SwizZz]
Ey yo first thing's first (What nigga?)
Add a mothafuckin' Z on it
You need a hit?
Take a beat, put me on it
You want a dick?
Here it is, come feast on it
Just don't bite ho, I said no teeth on it
This is reminiscing the 05'
Ballin' in Monroe High
Gym packed every Friday night
Win or lose, it went down on the weekend
Parents out of town, so you know we teen drinkin'
Post game groupies
Shots to the dome
Seeing double, feeling woozy
Trying to get the girls drunk and make them shake they booty
Laughing at tipsy homies
Slip and fall in the jacuzzi
Even back then life was like a movie
And somehow I survived it
The bad guy didn't die
I'm alive and still wildin'
Niggas starin' cause I'm stylin'
I pose for the lames
Take a photo bitch
I'm bout to put you in the game

[Hook: SwizZz]
Girl you look like an 8
But you got a nice ass
I don't wanna kiss
But I'll throw you on the tracks
Let me put you on the train
I'mma throw you on the train
Let me put you on the train
I'mma throw you on the train
You only had one drink and your wildin' out
Actin' like a drunk
Wanting balls in your mouth
Let me put you on the train
I'mma throw you on the train
Let me put you on the train
I'mma throw you on the train

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
So you tell me your name's SwizZz
Why do you sound so different?
Why are your eyes black?
Are you rollin' or dissin'?
Do you worship the devil?
Are you in some type of cult?
Do you sacrifice babies and do witch-craft on the low?
Damn, how did you know girl?
Your favorite show must be True Blood on HBO girl
I sleep in a coffin waitin' for the moon to glow girl
When night strikes I'm eager to bite you
Better be careful when your alone girl
Relax ho, I'm an ordinary nigga
Rap name SwizZz, real name Justin Ritter
I went to UCI and decided not to finish
Now I'm trying to make a livin' rhyming words in a sentence

[Hook]
