[Verse 1: SwizZz]
Now welcome to my world, little boys and girls
I would like to take the time and thank you for my referral
The west coast summons me, right
Well I'm here to tend the wound like a bucket of ice (Go)
I wake 'em up, throw some Z's on it
I make 'em bounce with the lean on it
I'll make a crip throw a 'B' on it
I'll make a blood throw a 'C' on it
It's FV, you wanna be on it (Never!)
I'm calling the shots now, locking the block down
Getting bucked like a dollar bill, come and follow
I'm getting money but fuck the dollar
I ain't flossing, I'm romping, got a problem? Holla'
I'm just here to make a few changes
Rearrange this rap game 'cause it's been tainted
While you cookie cutting niggas spitting candy of the beat
I'ma heat it up like 'wave and go Miami on the beat

[Hook: Hopsin]
Now take a trip through the mind of a nigga
You must see the signs of a killer, it's too far gone
I said, take a trip through the mind of a nigga
You must see the signs of a killer, ooh killer

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
Now, there's something I should address, sum up
The game's drunk and I mean fucked up
Too many niggas wanna bang but they can't dunk
Too many niggas wanna ball but they just suck
Too many niggas selling out like an auction
I should pop 'em like a tag, I'm not shopping
You got swag? That's cool with me
But let me tell you why you shouldn't fool with me
Test me, I smash a nigga like Pepsi
Hardbody baby, knock the niggas into next week
A prodigy causing havoc like I'm [?]
You want that real rap shit, come get involved with me
'Cause I'ma get 'em geek like nerdy
Jerk 'em like beef 'cause I'm flyer than a bird be
You heard me, I'm putting down on you niggas
Now why do I even come around for you niggas?

[Hook: Hopsin]
Now take a trip through the mind of a nigga
You must see the signs of a killer, it's too far gone
I said, take a trip through the mind of a nigga
You must see the signs of a killer, ooh killer

[Verse 3: SwizZz]
Look see, I'm ill like Wayne with a germ on him
And smooth like Snoop Dogg with a perm on him
See, I can rock it like L with no shirt on it
But I don't want your girl to trip like she's failing on me
I've got the baton but I ain't gon' pass it on
I smoke big kush blunts then ash 'em off
I tell a girl with no hands to come and jack me off
I love college but I fucking hate Asher Roth
I'm fiending to crack a bottle like Marshall
And getting drunk as fuck and do a hundred in the carpool
C'mon baby girl, we don't have to argue
I just wanna fuck and forget you like Sarah Marshall
I live my life according to no rules
With the old school touch, I'm fresher than Whole Foods
Don't forget, write a note about it
It's FV, welcome to my world, whatchu know about it?

[Hook: Hopsin]
Now take a trip through the mind of a nigga
