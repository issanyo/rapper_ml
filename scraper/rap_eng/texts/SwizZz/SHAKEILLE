[Verse 1: Madmarshgator]

You all lost your paradise, paralyzed
Taking up no chances
It's okay if you act stupid
When you're white guy with five fans
I undermine gold opportunities because I'm
Underaged in mind
It's why I hide my whiney lines inside like Montresor hid his crime
All you seek fame off cliched lines so violent
So why not put your rap life aside until you hit your mid life crisis
I wouldn't tell y'all this if I really didn't feel it
Now that's a prescription in the realness so why you critics diss the clinic
I parked at Kanku's gas station
Pay full tank for Atlanta
And I get pissed off when some fools ain't taking full advantage
This chick went and crashed her ride, and still got Spring break with her sisters in Tampa
And when she got knocked up, you can bet your bottom buck there was a manhunt
But MTV got her a show where she gets paid to get pampered

[Verse 2]

Contractions, baby steps, advances
Campus police on me for my banned practice
Next week, Danny's playing through the amp
While I'm belching out help notes from my bass guitar's neck
Here's the basics
Save your neck
8 dollars to enter
You should totally save it
Consider it a raise to your daily pay waiting tablets
Can I get an amen? No
Then I'll take a pain med
I saw your daughter at the club, she was quite the bouncer
Does she have a day job or is that what she's about, sir
If I could have her hand I would without a doubt, sir
Write "freak" on it with Sharpie and make sure she don't wash it out, sir
Shout out to my follows on Twitter
Without you 88 I may not be getting any dinner
Even though between you 88, I talk more to my midterms
When I'm asking answers like Trebek trekking on a Jeeve's search, yo

[Verse 3]

Days are latex, late text message
Time tighter than the point of a pyramid's apex
When everybody drunk or humping each other to Bassnectar
I'm at Best Buy best trying not to buy mix editor
I'm on my shit like Curtis Cook be
Sleeping on me--well, Ashley Furniture booked me
I'm so used to seeing rap as a hood thing
901-Memphis-I'm located on ____ Street
My office hours are posted on blackboard
Look it up, I can teach you in how to act bored
And complain about the same made up lies
Of an act more
Overused than Michael Cera as the big screen cast dork
Call a woman a bitch and she'll respect you
And rap about your dick throughout the mixtape
You'll get ten views
This formula is success
In the end, dude
I mean, how could this not work?
It's the best, dude
Learned behavior, it's follow the leader
In the game now
We got our cups under the udders of the cash cow
I been inactive so long, my ki gauge must be maxed out
Firing my lasers may hurt, but I'm a fatter bitch than
Oprah with her hair down
Bye
