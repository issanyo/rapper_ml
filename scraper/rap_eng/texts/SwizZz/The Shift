[Intro]
You need a hit to get to where I live, yep
You need a hit to get to where I live

[Verse 1]
I give until it hurts and then I offer more
These times are different, I hope you're ready for what's in store
Became attached to the illusion that I cannot afford
But God is working through me every time I hit record
No compromise, I rather take the sword
Go 'head and question if I'm changing coarse
Or if there's options that l'm leaning towards
Or if I'm under pressure feeling forced
No I just feel the force
The grind is like a sport
The doubt is valid but [?]
The proof is scattered on these instrumentals I import
Careful what you're begging for
Sometimes we do not make it back
I cherish the chance that I have to make up for what I lacked
To rectify the lies, people twisting facts
Stuck to a screen [?] living through a fucking snap
Where you at? Working in vain, the chase is a trap
And plain sight life is getting snatched
Busy minds with open apps
Scrolling through a feed
Provides a way to cope but it don't give you what you need
Don't tell me what you achieved
Demonstrate what you've become
Many nights in isolation made me realize where I'm from
There's nothing to regain, the transition has begun
Used to ship merch out the house, all them boxes in the trunk
Had orders being fulfilled, invoices getting billed
Turned the bedroom to a storage
Labels printed out and sealed
Such a minor contribution but I had to do the job
With [?] chilling stacking shelves the garage
Seven years later and I'm up against the odds
But this life is just a dream and I don't fancy the facade
I'm ready for the shift, forgive me if I slip
Dark days are getting darker, people dying for a fix
The valley's going mad, the city is a drift
Watching families getting shattered, too many losing their grip
We all at war here and can't nobody hide
Open up your chest before you claim or pick a side
Ignorance is fatal, you can reap what you disguise
Motivated by something greater preparing to arrive

[Outro]
I give until it hurts and then I offer more
These times are different, I hope you're ready for what's in store
Became attached to the illusion that I cannot afford
But God is working through me every time I hit record
