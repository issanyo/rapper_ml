[Intro - SwizZz]
Bom bom bom bom
Oh, bom bom bom boop
Hey, bom bom bom bom
Al-right, here we go

[SwizZz]
Yo, one, two check like a mark I'm here
Niggas get cozy, its gon' be a long year
I'm not by myself so don't try that from the rear
I got Dizzy runnin' with me, I'd advise you be aware

[Dizzy Wright]
Uh, mindset racing, I got a duffle bag
Try to snatch it, turn your face into a punchin' bag
The ladies love the tats, want to lick 'em front to back
Fuck her once she sneakin' out and I don't think she comin' back

[SwizZz]
Nah, and I don't think she's coming back neither
So you should quit callin' and textin' and take a breather
She only fuck with you cause your face got in her beaver
Now she moved on, I know you seen the logo on her T-shirt

[Dizzy Wright]
Uh, high life I'm blowin' ghosts on a lonely road
Dummy flow, Steve Harvey said I was Romeo
You chasing women, I'm chasing what God only knows
If you dont think we rock the show, then what the fuck you comin' for?

[SwizZz]
Now tell me that, huh, why you on that bullshit?
You'll get screwed like a driver, get your tool kit
I'm schooling niggas and I'm handing out the rubric
You talkin' like you got it but you haven't even proved shit

[Dizzy Wright]
Boy you ain't never moved shit, you don't move bricks
Still livin' wit' your grand-mama and your two kids
You a broke confused kid, I'm legendary
Never secondary, I grind whenever its necessary

[SwizZz]
Man I unnecessarily talk shit to talk it
The rap like TV or a damn deposit
On some different shit and cognizant I'm fucking awkward
I'm in your bathroom shittin' on your granite faucet

[Dizzy Wright]
Your shit is awful boy don't try to get in touch with me
Nasty flow, I two girls, one cup the beat
Smoking weed, getting high with a couple freaks
That love the D, especially, cause can't nobody can fuck with me

[SwizZz]
Shit, now that's a commonality we both share
I'm 'bout to take flight just lookin' for a low fare
A few resist the urge to look, but most stare
You ain't never ball, just your bitch got no hair

[Dizzy Wright]
You got it baldy, I'm Barry Bond in your fuckin' noggin'
Top Ramen watch but see nothing in common
Boy stop it, I get it poppin', I been a problem
You been a weirdo, you probably hang out with Dennis Rodman

[SwizZz]
Your sittin' poolside, gettin' your hair-doo died
Your mama must regret not gettin' her fuckin' tubes tied
In a double-knot to preventing the fuckin' shame
Of having a grown man without an asset to his name

[Dizzy Wright]
Uh, your rap career ain't no realer then a monkey turtle
I smoke too much, I'm always in a funky circle
I got the purple, you fuckers are too commercial
My lyrics deliver murder, we do this shit, no rehearsal

[SwizZz]
Man practice? What the fuck is practice? A.I
I'm insect repellent to those claimin' they stay fly
Dizzy taught me how to cook, now I bake pies
Stupid ass swag, like I got my fuckin' brain fried

[Dizzy Wright]
I swear my dick long like a giraffe neck
Baby wanna try, and say she havin' bad sex
I wake up, swag out, and then I cash checks
This rapper money got me wantin' to enter a math test

[SwizZz]
You get your work check, cash it, and break down to ones
Then pour 'em on male strippers when you need some fun
I earn a check, deposit it into my savings fund
Re-up on tree when I'm on E and slide my mom a couple bucks

[Dizzy Wright]
Mom's comfy, now find dudley
I think I'm the bomb, because I keep the bomb on me
Bomb dot com, slash con, Diggity Simmons, Kennedy Don
YG, with these ratchets, who be fuckin' around with my time, uh

[SwizZz]
Eh, one more time (uh), last one for the homies (uh)
*gibberish*
That means I'm gettin' busy like I got no common shit
I'm high wit Dizzy, gettin dizzy, faded off a couple hits

[Dizzy Wright]
We on the come up quick, Funk Volume runnin' shit
Breeze got me sippin' slow and haters y'all can suck a dick
I'm Dizzy Wright and I'm faded and on some other shit
SwizZzle told me can't nobody fuck with this

(Easy)
