[Verse 1: Nay Nay]

I don't sleep cause I have terrible dreams
I’m just A kid at 18 and I don't know what life means
And still I fiend for the time when I'm finally seen
But I don't take it to extremes like the stars on the screens
I mean, I've Lost three friends in two years
I am just one man with a few tears
And god damn man it’s unreal
The pain that I feel under layers concealed
The reaper was revealed as my peers disappeared
With people in the field of my school all in tears
I've faced my fears that I have met through the years
Plus I Cleared my mind writing these songs that you hear
Graduation nears but these times were unexpected
Looking all around at the lives They've affected
Thinking to myself in a way we're all connected
Reflected on my actions and the choices I've selected

[Hook: SwizZz & Nay Nay]

This is dedicated to the fallen
The ones that we love and will never be forgotten
The ones helpin’ us through the struggles that we Fought in
Who we seek guidance from when times get rotten
Yeah, This is dedicated to the kids
The ones who remember where the good times live
The ones who keep alive all the things they did
Who are by your side no matter how rough it is

[Verse 2: SwizZz]

Look, yo, see I'm tired of it all
I don't wanna pick up a call
Shouldn't be focused on my falls
But I am, looking for ways to understand
This life that has me trapped, I wish I had a plan for the madness
I mean I don't wish, I just gotta grab it and kick bad habits
I'm coming back at it stronger than ever
And niggas will get you down, but that's only if you let ‘em
Aye Nay Nay

[Verse 3: Nay Nay]

That's why I live each day like my last
Looking forward to the future but remember our past
And remember the laughs and remember our class
Cherish the time we spent and the moments we had
Yeah, so we can't bury ourselves inside sorrow
Hold on to memories but look on to tomorrow
Cause that's when I'll be stronger than today
Though bonds break, I won't let y'all drift away, hey

[Hook: SwizZz & Nay Nay]


[Outro: SwizZz]

This is dedicated to the fallen
The ones that we love and will never be forgotten
The ones helpin’ us through the struggles that we Fought in
Who we seek guidance from when times get rotten
Yeah, This is dedicated to the kids
The ones who remember where the good times live
The ones who keep alive all the things they did
Who are by your side no matter how rough it is
