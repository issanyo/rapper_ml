[Verse 1: KidCrusher]
Walking through the streets and seeing hate in everybody's eyes
Some they wanna fight some they think I wanna fright
I might as well walk around with my face painted
No matter what I'm doing I am always fucking hated

I'm standing in the corner and I'm not around the rest
I never fucking fit in cus I'm not the fucking best
I'm slipping on my ass in the middle of the street
Everybody's looking so I toss my fucking meat (WHOAH!)

Everyday is fucked up and I can fucking prove it
I'm in my own world, and still they wanna get me
Hit me twenty five times in the face and take my last dime
Then I see a juggalo they stop and say "What's up!"

The world is fucking furious and we're the calm ones
You've pushed us in the corner, and now I'm gonna get my
Family aside from this world full of hatred
Your fucking racist and that's bottom line

[Hook: KidCrusher]
I'm an outcast, your just living a lie
And I will out last (I'm like a zombie I will never die)
I'm feeling all feelings inside of my head
And if you wanna get down, get the fuck outta my head

My head, my head, now, Get the fuck outta my head
My head, my head, now

[Verse 2: Swizzz]
Aye crusher, I gotta ask you a favour
Can I borrow a shotgun extra shells and a razor
I'll be back an hour later to dust a bottle of jager
And to finish the bubble kush I left in the container

I got moves to make tonight, dog!
I'm getting the urge to wanna re-enact saw
Violate the law, crack a couple jaws
You better pray to god that we never fucking cross, bitch!

Witness a misfit with no hope left
Who's sick and tired of waking up in cold sweats
Don't fret, It's me on the door step
Ready to leave the crime scene so grotesque

I protest, I'm not possessed
It isn't wrong to wanna eat your own flesh
Maybe not but fuck it, what ever
Sometimes a nigga just don't know better, ah!

[Verse 3: Chico]
Yeah that's me, Mr. Chop you with a bro axe
An outcast slash killer with a contract
You can catch me at your show with my ball sacks
Hanging way out so you can fuckin see it all black

Fuck your wack raps I serve you like flap jacks
Puff pass that shit nigga don't stash that
I know you got that bubble kush up in your back pack
Now hand it over before I fuckin have to snatch that

You see, I am a little bit psycho
Start stabbing at your neck while reading verses from the bible
I'm not a disciple but I am your rival
Twelve gage pointed at your head let you die slow

Catch me at a side show, pimpin from the 5.0
Never catch me slippin you trippin if you think so
Outcast for life, mask and a knife
Duck and take cover start running for your life

[Hook: KidCrusher]
I'm an outcast, your just living a lie
And I will out last (I'm like a zombie I will never die)
I'm feeling all feelings inside of my head
And if you wanna get down, get the fuck outta my head

My head, my head, now, Get the fuck outta my head
My head, my head, now
