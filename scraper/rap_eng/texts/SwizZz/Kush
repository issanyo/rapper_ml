Hold up and wait a minute let me put sum SwizZz up in it (x3)
Hold up and wait a minute cuz I smoke..KUSH

Yea I'm no Kush connoisseur but I do get blown
What you expect the west coast is my home
So I pack super bowls no NFL
Light it up, take a toke, hold it in, exhale
I rip bongs with my bros smoke spliffs with my niggas
Hit the pipe with my girl while im sippin on my liquor
That's Jack in my cup I can't afford the Patron
Fuck the expensive shit im still in my zone
(cover 2 buddy)
You little lovers man up
You can smell whats in my back
When I'm poppin the damn trunk
If the cops pull me over ima bribe em with the OG (say what?)
Kick back and hit a sack with the police
Everybody smokes out here dont be senile
I got 23 connects on speed dial
Just tell your doctor that you have migraines
Get a club card and let the ganja sooth the pain
Theres a clinic on every corner dont worry about supply
Puff it once puff it twice then pass it off to the right
Or pass it off to the left or keep it all to yourself
Your trying to get faded and all I want to do is help
So smoke till you choke like you missed a game winner
Or toke till your twisted like my middle two fingers
West coast baby
Im not from L.A, Crenshaw, Compton, or Long Beach are you crazy
Born in the valley of the earthquake
So I'mma hold it down from packtown to west lake yup! yup!

Excuse my voice, but I'm highly in need of water, I just hit the blunt and almost died oh, thank you Father up above for this plant and its label of a drug I can never get enough of weed smoke in my lungs

I got kush clouds blurrin' my vision
Every sentence that I spew is so damn contridicting
I hear the homie in the front seat freakishly trippin'
Screamin' out G.S.P has him in an arm bar submission
Like (really?) this motherfucker's over reacting
Hes hallucinatin' like were chillin' chewin' on acid
The bleezy wasn't laced, he only hit it twice
When I asked if he was fine he said he was feelin right (I'm straight)
10 minutes later now he's bitin on the laces of his nikes
This fool is done for the night (holler) alright
I'm runnin' the green mile like Mike Clarke Duncan
Minus the Asics and my iPod bumpin'
Freein' my mind because my pockets are strugglin'
The bills are stackin' up and they dont stop comin'
The herb is my gateway dog I gotta do something
To ease my mom from people constantly buggin'
Preachin 'bout I should've stayed in school
Then get mad when I get mad like I'm suppose to play it cool (shit, bitches)
Lick right between my ass cheeks
And then trickle down to where my balls and shaft meet
Now open up wide to catch a load of my black meat
And swallow it whole and wipe your mouth with my black tea (Mmm good)
Those are my instructions for the skeptics
3 z's I got the antidote if your restless
And if I dont put you to sleep the kush will
So light it up and experience how you should feel
Prop 19 failed, fuck it
I'm still getting higher than my voice is, suck it
