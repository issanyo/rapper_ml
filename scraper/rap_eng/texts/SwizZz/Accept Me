Tommy Wrekz (Chorus)
Look me in my eyes and tell me what do you see?
I'm just a young man struggling to make it
You look at what I wear and you're quick to judge me...
Just because I don't live the way you would choose...
But just give me your love, understand me
Look at where I came from, why can't you accept me?
I don't need your love, that's why I'm angry...
You look at where I came from and criticize me...
Don't criticize me, stop criticizing
Look at where I came from, why can't you accept me?
I don't need your love, that's why I'm angry...
You look at where I came from and criticize me
Don't criticize me

SwizZz (Verse 1)
Ey, I think it's funny how they're always quick to judge, (yeah)
As soon as you get a buzz they're begging for a plug, (c'mon)
One minute they hate you, the next minute it's love
And they want you to catch a case or get addicted to drugs
Shit what the fuck is going on out here?
Secret intentions and hidden motives got you thinking the wrong idea
I ain't the nigga you assumed I was...(nope)
So save the smiles and the groupie hugs for another nigga you meet at the club. (ayy)
Is it me rapping that got you thinking that I'm a statistic? (HUH?)
Is it my complexion that blinds you to the fact I'm different? (HUH?)
Maybe I'm tripping then, I shouldn't say a word about it
Never speak my mind or tell the motha fucking world about it. (nah)
Just do what you gotta do to keep your motor running, (chea)
Cause you ain't gonna stop shit that hit so keep on coming, (chea)
Some niggas always gonna talk, critics always judging
Whatever, it's nothing! Fuck 'em, turn us up and keep it bumping! Yeah

Tommy Wrekz (Chorus)
Look me in my eyes and tell me what do you see?
I'm just a young man struggling to make it
You look at what I wear and you're quick to judge me...
Just because I don't live the way you would choose...
But just give me your love, understand me
(College Station) look at where I came from, why can't you accept me?
I don't need your love, (let's go) that's why I'm angry...
You look at where I came from and criticize me...
Don't criticize me, (nah) stop criticizing, (nah)
Look at where I came from, why can't you accept me? (4-9-0)
I don't need your love, that's why I'm angry...
You look at where I came from and criticize me, (Tommy Wrekz)

Tommy Wrekz (Verse 2)
First of all, I'm not gang involved, (nah)
I'm from a family of crips, but you don't know them at all...
Who are you to try to judge the lifestyle that I crawled?
With no intentions to solve the hardships that I brawled?...
Yeah it's pissing me off, the 2 facedness
Only true fakeness, I lost my best friend it created cruel hatred...
People tryta fit in so they on this cool wait list
While I'm flippin' off the world cause I'm a world rebel patriot...
Bullied at a young age, (chea) fighting turned to gun play, (chea)
With a single momma I didn't get to see her some days, (I love you momma)
Gettin' jumped on Sundays, missing school on Mondays
Gettin' picked on for being half white for fuck sakes...
Why is it that I'm getting labeled by appearance?
Cause I rap I'm incoherent? And I'm black my perseverance is low?
Interference with goals, they acting like it was my got damn decision to go thru
The things that I went thru...
The shit I got into
I been around the drugs and that was something I didn't do
Since I'm from the hood you think you know what I've been thru
Vanchanza was the one who showed me what a true friend do...(Rest in peace)
And now she gone, (chea) there's so much going on, (damn)
And I'm so different from these others so I feel I don't belong
They look at where I come from and my skins a different tone
And automatically assume that we would never get alongâ€¦Wrekz

Tommy Wrekz (Chorus)
Look me in my eyes and tell me what do you see?
I'm just a young man struggling to make it
You look at what I wear and you're quick to judge me...
Just because I don't live the way you would choose...
But just give me your love, understand me
(College Station) look at where I came from, why can't you accept me?
I don't need your love, (let's go) that's why I'm angry...
You look at where I came from and criticize me...
Don't criticize me, (nah) stop criticizing, (nah)
Look at where I came from, why can't you accept me? (4-9-0)
I don't need your love, that's why I'm angry...
You look at where I came from and criticize me, (Tommy Wrekz)
