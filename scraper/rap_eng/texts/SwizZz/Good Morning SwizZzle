[SwizZz]

Yo, my flow is colder than the shoulder that I give to stupid hoes
That want dick to brag about it with their girl on the low
Like 'Hey girl on the low, did you hear what-what-what happened?'
'I put my two lips on SwizZz's dick and then I got it crackin''
Like suck, swallow, suck, swallow, that's the motto that they follow
Make a cherry pop like a champagne bottle, hit it like the lotto, then roll like a model
Hey, now how you doing? I'm sorry in advance for the kids I ruin
I've never killed but I got the balls to do it
If my records don't sell then I'mma have to prove it
Lose it, like a fucking wallet, my game is fowl like a technical reps Rasheed Wallace
I'll ring your fucking neck like I called it, beat your body 'til it's fucking stiff like I paused it
I'm so indifferent, that I'm fucking different
I'll cut you extra niggas off like a circumcision
Let's envision, life after college, you studied hard, graduated, now you're ass is jobless
Thanks U.C. for my degree, now I'm working as a manager at I.H.O.P
And I'll flip the best pancakes, you'll ever eat
But I can't afford to pay for this truck I just leased
Cause these student loans have me in debt, man I can not believe
How I still manage to breathe, I got payments to my knees
So much stress it's hard to sleep, toss 'n' turning in my sheets
Plus my bitch of a girl got back with her ex and moved to Tennessee
Eee, the college route was foolish, I thought education was the key. Bullshit!
Not in my case, get that shit out my face, my words are contraband and like they say homie, crime pays
It's just the facts, I can't relax, I just sniffed the 8-ball off of Weslie's back
What the fuck is that? Oh, that's your girl's grill, she is busting, disgustingly, ugly, ewww
If you're curious, then take a look. How I pop up to the top like a children's book
I spit flame like I grill and cook, I knocked T-Pain out, now that's what I call a hook
My attitude is really shitty, I took a piss in a vitamin water, shook it and gave it to 50
Great investment Curtis, now take a swig of urine
Don't be shy, you need to hydrate, you fucking earned it
Please don't close the curtains, open them back up like a surgeon
I've been baptized in detergent, but somehow my damn mouth couldn't be cleaned up with a ShamWow
So I cuss out loud like a mad child, screaming 'fuck, fuck, fuck'! 'til I pass out
I apologize for my random outburst, next time I'll think before I belch my feelings out first
