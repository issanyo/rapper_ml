Welcome to the masquerade, light it up
Like a flash grenade, blinding your eyes, like your worst mistake
Ever, that shit was far from clever
I'll enter with the intentions of changing for the better
Just another extension to this future that I envision
I'll keep spitting this venom, laced with passion and wisdom
I'm crashing through the competition, with godly ambition
Reforge my mission, your path of intuition, It's a blast to even witness
It's a fast paced race, watching our stories unfold
How can we settle for mistakes if we believe in our souls?
Had many reasons to fold, but those excuses grow old
When you're getting sick and tired of people telling you "No"
So I had to make it past all those fakes and snakes, many chains to break
I had to focus on this power inside, enlighten my way
Through the darkness, this heart just refused to fall apart
I'll be damned if I misuse it, on this journey we embark
It's time to focus this energy, you all gon' remember me
Our legacy is inevitably in question, I see
But the answer lies in our dreams, hidden behind the scenes
Provoke our hope so we can cope and find a way to believe
To the top with this new shit, excuse me, I make music, yes I do this
I was raised multi-influenced, different stages, kept it moving
Now today I'm finally proving I was made to fucking do this
Everlasting passion with the brains to make shit happen
I'm exceeding expectations and laughing at all distractions
Clashing with all you bastards that refuse to see what's happening
Right in front of our faces, keep tripping on your laces
Make way I'm coming through, It's my time, no hesitation
I'm taking it, yeah yeah yeah, I said I'm taking it
Cause I refuse to lose and by the end of this contest, you'll be feeling me too
It's JP man, this is what I do
