[Verse 1 - Clever]
I really think you should change your strategy
I mean you can fall for dumb shit and blame gravity
But when agression turns to agony its such a tragedy
When i put a hollow through your fuckin teeth like a cavity
Talking down to my team thats blasphemy
You should know i got goons thatll blast for me
And leave you all fucked up like the government
And they known to carry heat like an oven mit
And ri ri right before life support i might like to strike a chord
I might resort to your vocal chord with a knife or sword
Wich one? shh im not real quite for sure
Whichevers quicker to drain the little bit of life you fighting for and wipe the floor
When i come up with 45s like a deck of cards
It ain't no cardiologist shit just tryna check his heart
I might leave your whip in the wrecking yard
And it'll take a crowbar to pry my hands and your neck apart
(FUCKER)

[Hook - Clever]
I Just wanna kill people for a living
I'm just givin em hell caz hells all ive been given
I'm just wishen em well while i pushem down the well
Then wishin in shhhh NOBODY CAN SAVE YOU!(X2)

[Verse 2 - SwizZz]
I ain't no killer but dont push me, trust me
Your motor mouth will leave you lookin like you play rugby
No teeth call that nigga grandpa
I hit him with a 2 peice then bounced like a hand ball
Bad days create bad intentions and im willin to carry em out
Im sick enough to stick the curb in your mouth
Tell your ass to bite down then demand you to shout
Then stomp the back of your head and watch your jaw hit the ground
Its like that!
Imma loose cannon with two handguns
Bustin in tandem
Sprayin random mutha fuckas im willin in planin
To bring hell to the surface
And to send you to whatever god you worship
It probably ain't worth it
But its hard to see my purpose
Ive tried long enough and i'm ready to stop searchin
I put up with too much and i need to relieve the burden
Im certain
Ay clever this niggas gon need a surgeon (YUP)
