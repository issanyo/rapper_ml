[Intro]
We'll be alright, yeah

[Verse]
I wanna make you proud when you mention my name
I'm moving up and ain't nothing the same
I'll probably never fit in or be a part of this game
Twitpicing with other artists tryna eat off a name
That I did not build myself, I don't do it for the views
If the product doesn't cut it, the momentum isn't true
Let the music talk, the opinions are necessary
The focus is on my craft, everything else is secondary
It relies on the fans now, I'm going hard for the fam now
I will pull up if your pants down, man down
What up, Kyle, can you say "Launch"
Freshman balling at the arch, it was a fucking [?]
Launching corner threes fading out of bounds
I would always shake my head until I seen the shit go down
Bad shot but it's still a bucket
Watching me leave from FV was really hard to stomach
Fuck it, in hindsight I get it
I thank you for the text even when I don't reply
You took me to my first show ever at UCI
Kanye was touching the sky
Walking with Jesus through the wire, hands gettin' him high
I rode shotgun while you drove in the Cherokee
Used to sip wine watching Entourage and BBC
Rolling bars at EDC
The first time I met Erica
Six years later you put a ring on her and married her
Damn, time flies and I'm still here grinding
Still here rhyming, still here climbing
Still not giving a shit about these rappers out
I took the contacts out but I'm still blacking out
Moving, executing what I'm planning now
Won't let the summer be the verdict
I'ma make it really clear, something hard to misinterpret
It's nothing, I got it, they looking, they watching
They urning for a worthy topic to talk about
Better share your thoughts about it
I got it covered
Without a cover we gon' get the coverage
Only relation I need to build right now is with the public
I wanna make you proud when you mention my name
We're moving up and ain't nothing the same
I'll probably never fit in or be a part of this game
Cause most lose touch trying to be something they claim
It's awful

[Outro]
