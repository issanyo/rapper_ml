You know
I can't seem to find a way out
So i gotta ask

What do you want
What do you need
Why are still here
Why are you near me
Why can’t you be gone
Look how you made me
Now i'm a monster
Living a dark dream
Yeah
What do you want
What do you need
Why are still here
Why are you near me
Why can't you be gone
Look how you made me
Now i’m a monster
Living a dark dream
What do you want

Why are still here
Why are you near me
Why can't you be gone
Look how you made me
Now i'm a monster
Living a dark dream

Yup
Look
How could you cope with the pain living in shame
Who's to blame when you're addicted to the fame
Tryna make a name
Nothing you claim is validated
Dark Dreams man this shit is aggravating
I just want to change the world
Yeah buddy
Shut that ass up
Dealing with demons on the daily so i'm filling my cup
Toast to regret
Sweat down my neck
I gotta take this last shot fo' i hit the deck and make a mess
Every motherfucking step i take i'm hearing voices
Running through my head, man i’m tryna keep it cool
Felt like i’m bout to cave, Im tempted to misbehave
Shit i might catch somebody slipping after school
Shit I know i'm problematic and it’s only getting worse
My appetite is growing, my belly's about to burst
I'm about to slip but this wouldn't be my first
Swizzle is official, I’m a blessing and a curse
What it do what

What do you want
What do you need
Why are still here
Why are you near me
Why can't you be gone
Look how you made me
Now i'm a monster
Living a dark dream
Yeah
What do you want
What do you need
Why are still here
Why are you near me
Why can't you be gone
Look how you made me
Now i'm a monster
Living a dark dream

Living a dark dream in a very scary place
I'm becoming a monster, got a mask on my face
Yeah i seem calm but make no mistake
Deep down i'm a killer, got a Jigsaw mind state
Machete by my waist, blood on the floor
This nightmare is reality and i'm ready for war
I suggest you run when i come to your door
Cuz this is The Purge and i wanna see gore
I gotta calm down i think i hear the cops coming
Somebody please help me from what i'm becoming
This kid talked shit the other day, so i killed him
Bet he didn't know he was talking to a villain
Every other day I have a random act of violence
Always get away cuz i'm aware of the sirens
I got a demon in my mind, but an angel in my heart
Now please let me welcome you to the dark
Dudjaaa
