[Verse 1 : DieVerse]

First off, I'm underrated
Flow like gold is an understatement
D-I-E though i got the patience to wait so long to be fucking famous
I'm roughing nature, puffin these enough to bake ya
Sonny go home, better [?]
Get back, I'm a sith lord, imma bite y'all fuckers like a pitbull
I'm an artist, you're a novice with a logic smaller than a mitzu
Oh no wait, you're a bozo, face it, all y'all fakes better know the basics
Im a bounty hunter, Boba Fett with a laser chasing
Obi Wan Kenobi, hit 'em in the face with a rock [?], stop the phony,little rotten dosi, you're momma told me i'm a profit homey
Never been a fake, you ain't gotta know me
Skitzo (what?), people call me Tony,
Skate all day, puff grass, I'm an asshole. eat y'all like a pot of macaroni
I'm a cynical OG, get 'em and go, I'm a venomous weapon
Teach 'em a lesson, I'm at the top, and its never a question
Listen I'm destined, never been less never the best, give 'em a rest and come to my senses
Never regret, been craving attention, slaughtered them up but i gave them a blessing
I'm a motherfucking monster, gollum where the fuck my precious?
Imma gobble rappers, stand and mix the perp, and they fit the lettuce
Bet i give a little bit of red, I hope I save a soul and jedi
Kick it with a little bit of robe and anger
Open flames, smoke with a broken hater
Imma do it big, making this shit official
[?] I miss you, this place im living is hard to get to
Different jujutsu, I'll hit you with a pencil, its simple
I cripple careers and I'm popping haters like fucking pimples

[Verse 2: SwizZz]

Heangh! This stuff is simple, shit, I get off on any instrumental
I'm detrimental to your fucking mental
No one to vent to
So I chose the mic to let it all out, killing these verses, and speaking my mind, expressing my pain and describing the grind
Yo! I'm merciless, you heard me bitch, I'm ready to conquer
Bonafide romper, gettin a [?] to visit your family doctor
I dont play games, i change lanes and then smash out
Spent a couple years on my dads couch before I silenced everybody that had doubts
I value and cherish and niggas embarrass and take it all to a new height
This shit is apparent that i will embarrass whoever you bring to the mic
The flow's just like my homie on the track, DieVerse, I can make it fast or slow or vice-verse
About to be the king, gotta rep my turf, DieVerse, coming back to put in work, I'M GONE


[Verse 3: DieVerse]

Imma make it soon, i can feel the fucking pressure
Of 1000 hip hop artists spitting' wack with the game attention
But i forgot to mention you fuckers just ain't impressive
I'm on my grind all the time, you get that fucking message?
This beat, i'm bombing it, clobbering all you confident rappers who never bothered with opposites and there compliments
But  i'm offering honesty, probably making mockery
Causing bodily harm and hitting you hard subconsciously
