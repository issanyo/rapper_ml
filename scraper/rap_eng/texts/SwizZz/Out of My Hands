[Verse 1]
Yeah, another conversation will not make this right
Expressing your concern when you could use my light
I know you only do what you feel in your heart is right
But that's hard to remember when I hear your advice
Can't see the work that I've been puttin' in
It's kinda shocking but I'm learning not to take offense
Distracted by everything that you dabble in
A busy schedule, I hope that it's setting you up to win
You might not see it now, but I'ma be the one
To validate your work, how can I hold my tongue?
Feel like it's overdue for what we overcome
But the time gave me was need to embrace the plunge
You comment how I'm living like there's something off
I keep my circle small, it doesn't mean I'm lost
I really do get baffled when you share your thoughts
But I know it's 'cause you care so I just let you talk

[Chorus]
There's nothing I can say to you to help you understand
The proof is in the deed I do and that's just where it stands
I focus on myself, willing to help out when I can
Releasing all control, knowing this shit's outta my hands
There's nothing I can say to you to help you understand
The truth is in the demonstration, that's just where it stands
Judge me from afar, but it will not alter my plans
Releasing all control, knowing this shit's outta my hands

[Verse 2]
Another conversation will not make this right
Been worried 'bout you too, it keeps me up at night
You know I only do what I feel in my heart is right
But lately every discussion leads to another fight
You overlook the hours I've been punching in
Taking another route to get it so you're not convinced
The metric is the music, I cannot pretend
The journey's rough, but it put me in a position to win
You might not see now but that's just confirmation
The market is growing desperate and my lane is vacant
I'm sorry if I fail to meet the expectations
The conclusion will have to provide the explanation
That I don't want to do this if you're not involved
Build on a new foundation, let the past dissolve
The signs are staring at us, I won't miss the call
But I refuse to press the issue, I can't do it all

[Chorus]
There's nothing I can say to you to help you understand
The proof is in the deed I do and that's just where it stands
I focus on myself, willing to help out when I can
Releasing all control, knowing this shit's outta my hands
There's nothing I can say to you to help you understand
The truth is in the demonstration, that's just where it stands
Judge me from afar, but it will not alter my plans
Releasing all control, knowing this shit's outta my hands
