[Verse 1]
Look, I might just sing on this so you could say I switched
Turn up on the next one, tell you to eat a dick
Co-creator, I'm steering the ship
I'm stealing this shit for good
Those that hung around could probably feel it shift
It's working, I got too many options
Sometimes it's overwhelming and I get all responsive
Can't satisfy 'em all, I'm privy to the talking
That comes with any path you take, at least I gotta watch 'em
See I can switch the flow and still be me
Change the vibe and still tell them to triple up the Z's
Every angle that I address inturn gives me relief
Fighting a battle that nobody sees
Flirting with temptations that refuse to leave
I'm still moving even if it's at a different speed
If you do not know where I've been, what can you offer me?
What can you say to help?
Blindly tossing advice, you don't follow yourself
We all just want to feel needed so I allow the space
And I respect your intention even though it's not your place
Wait, I bet you never heard me put it down like this before
I'm slowly coming for mine while I'm taking what's yours

[Verse 2]
I might just really snap so you could say I changed
Been way too tired to play these fucking games
The past is creeping up, guess that means I'm heating up
Sneaking up, we don't have to talk for me to keep in touch
Why revisit the issue, there's nothing left to gain
The angry verses do not prove your claims
They just reveal your pain
This shit is heavy, I know
Say what you need but deep down I hope you use it to grow
Use it to show that money ain't the fix, problems tend to circle back
Until the issues get addressed and you're aware of what you lack
I been in a different space, far removed and less attached
Diss me if it helps you cope, the love I have is still intact
I disagree with you but I wish you well
I'm on to something, I know you can tell
I bet you never heard me put it down like this before
I'm slowly coming for mine while I'm taking what's yours
