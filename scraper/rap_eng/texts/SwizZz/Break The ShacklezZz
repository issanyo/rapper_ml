What the fuck is this, another contest beat?
Yes, I didn't make it past the first heat
But it doesn't matter, I can deal with defeat
And the vid was enough to get me on my feet
So now to spit while the track is spinning
I'm not the type to care about winning
If you look into my mind you can now envision
The lesson I learned: independent living
I'll throw up my tracks to the ether
Spread the words so that they reach you
Bandcamp page my record label
Penning rage like Bry Johnson, fable
Streaming the scrapcode that's embedded
Within the streams floating through my mind
This rhyme's not ill it's a glitch, caused by corrupt creator and corroded design
Cannot process like most other rappers
My failures in life filling more than a chapter
Like a chick calling me a user and liar
When she was the one who started the fire
Spinning, dizzy from the left turns taken
Heart not attached but my brain is aching
Colour flashes dance as I get migraine
Fuck all this shit, time to play my game
Kitty's not the only one repping black metal
Bullet belt on and a score to settle
I live in the realm of nihilism
Look at this globe through a fire prism
The US drowning in a sea of guns
According to the news, you better run
The UK filled with bigoted racists
I feel ashamed, our police try to chase this
Retards think that they know best
The government signs off their dole cheques
Spending on White lightning and cigarettes
Telling creeds to leave when we've not addressed
The crux of the matter: the British empire
We did that shit, made them follow our sire
So learn your history before kicking off
Fucking moron, you deserve to be locked
In a cell, I'll spit ruthless as hell
I'm not gonna spend my time walking on eggshells
Ripping this shit so you can't ignore this
The rhymes inspired and the beat by SwizZzzzzzzz
I'm sorry
Your rebuttal made me fall asleep, so boring
You give a lecture, I hit you like a lorry
Time to stretch after you left me snoring
Sure, you can play this rap game
But be authentic, channel rage and pain
None of this "swag swag swag" type bullshit
Send a message, I don't need a club hit
Fuck it, I'm off to chill with Demonika
Chatting in a cam room, watching her drink liquor
Mike there too, so we talk about weird crap
The 50ft Nerds break your brain like a cricket bat
Paul isn't here, he's gotta work tomorrow
He's got a 12-inch brag he's gotta follow
Joe's busy brushing up on bathroom safety
He's hoarding all the chutney so we haven't seen him lately
This isn't a scene, I'm breaking the shackles
Rapping to chill when you get up my hackles
Chicks want my Gooosh but then twist back on me
Time to ignore your flirting and flattery
Try to trick me into a commitment?
Nah, fuck that, I've seen what happens then
I'm a father, musician and Nerd first my friend
Open your ears, I won't tell you again
In fact, bring it on, you can fuel my fire
That I spit at weak fools as they desire
To leech at my neck like a fucking vampire
I can see you're one of them, you sparkle like a sapphire
You better run before I try to strangle you
Mic cord around your neck and now your face has started turning blue
Decrease the oxygen flow going to your brain
But by the sounds of it you didn't really use it much anyway
Put on this earth to corrupt the masses
Turn each beat into one of my classes
Teaching everyone the world is shit
But we need to step up if we're getting sick of it
Turn on the industry, start a movement
Spread our message to prove that we'll do this
Stop buying records of the ones who churn crap
The ones who slack and pretend to rap
Support the underground movement with this
Bandcamp, FV and Death Grips, add to the pull list
Expand the horizon, fulfil the potential
Add to the mechanics, we are differential
