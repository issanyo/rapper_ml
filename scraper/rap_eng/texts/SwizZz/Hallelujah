[Intro: Jarren Benton]
K-K-Kato on the track, bitch

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
Bitch, we got it popping, nigga, hallelujah
I woke up feeling great, nigga, hallelujah
Came up out the dumps, nigga, hallelujah
You know we getting to it, nigga, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Came up out the dumps, nigga, halleluja, hallelujah, hallelujah
Y'all don't want these boys to bring them problems to ya

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, Benton season
Getting sloppy toppy, while I'm sipping riesling
Foreign hoes, one North Korean, that's Kato's sister
Bitch, I'm sicker than Adolf Hitler, the K gon' lift ya
Pain in the ass, like an anal blister
I kill a rapper, let the angels get ya
Then I walk around and just strangle niggas
Age of Ultron, nigga, I hold guns
The arms are Voltron, the sword is Shogun
Absorbing protons, distorting organs
My dick is four tons, fucking moron
A fucking four blood, the fork in your lungs
One abortion, that’s unimportant
My daddy left, that's like a fucking orphan
Get Casper, crashing in the Aston Martin
Yeah, that's Aston Martin
Word to Tommy, Cole, Pam, and Martins
Smoking space rocks, with a band of Martians
Eat everything ‘cause this bastard’s starving
And if it's three stripes, then Imma probably cop it
Your bread short, like Polly Pocket
You weak, nigga, you should probably stop it
When you invest in money, we gon' probably profit
Don't fuck with me, then I'll fuck with y'all
Niggas praying on my downfall
Hadouken niggas, shoot a fire ball
Out my palm, I bust through the fire wall
Free my nigga Flick James, bitch
I'm always on that Rick James shit
This FV, we set the trends and y'all fuck boys on that same shit

[Hook: Jarren Benton]

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
Hallelujah, fucking loser, howdy, Jarren, toss me the Ruger
I scrub my ass with a purple loofa
Got a few cucumbers inside my juicers
So, hey, girl, come take a sip of this shit
When you’re done, kiss the tip of my dick
Like it, or love it, I'm rushing, I'm busting
My enemies better get sick
Five-O, I am on the grind, fuck is on your mind
Here I'm talking, but I ain't got time
My girl left, but that's fine
Nobody’s tripping, you made the decision
Wait 'til I catch the new nigga slipping
Thought I told you shit now is different
I pop a matic, get itching, look
Holding it steady, ready, let me get loose
This is something I do daily
Too many people going crazy, zany
Losing their minds, so I strap on my safety, yup
I burn this shit down
You see where I'm going, so now you start to come around
Fuck you, you had your shot
Now sit back and witness, I climb to the top, bitch
Shut the fuck up, I'm paranoid and I'm buzzing
My homies now, I can't trust them
Betrayal's now the new custom
The pain is deep, but I'm accustomed
At the end of the day, I still love them
No space for hate in my heart, that can wait in the dark
Funk Volume, we coming, hallelujah

[Hook: Jarren Benton]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Finna kill niggas with the new releases
Bitch how the fuck you not feeling me?(feeling me)
Puffing and feeling real friendly
I feel like a mess without the hostility
I'm bringing the funk in the head
And I don't know why cause I'm here til infinity
Stuntin on everybody that offended me
Smoking pot in the vicinity
I'm 24 and I'm so established
Swagged out like Leni Kravitz
Michael Jackson, Jarren Benton jacket
Hop on features, gettin high off dabbin
Getting money I don't know why y'all laughing
Make more than you just off collabing
Elevated like Aladdin
Hallelujah, how'd this happen?
Hold on let me switch the style let me getcha
Taking off with just me and my niggas
Bad bitch with her legs wide open
Plus some weed please she said enter
I'm just trying to get inside you
I'm the only one that could convince her
Riding 'round town sin city living lights
I'm with it cause I'm on an adventure
So if you don't fuck with me
Then I don't fuck with y'all
Finna blow a ticking bomb with it
The true guy, Black John Lennon
Chase bank account, got commas in it
Black and proud, free the homies
That was actin out we was at the house
She was deepthroating foaming at the mouth
Jumped in my whip and I was backing out

[Hook: Jarren Benton]
