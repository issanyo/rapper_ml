[Verse 1]
Every night I wake up, three in the mornin'
Insomnia keeps a little nigga zonin'
Thanks to you B, I can finally see the light
Cause I don't think they wanna know
What's on the other side
Darkness, but this ain't as dark as it gets
Laugh at them when they thought a nigga lost his wit
It's ok now cause it all seems legit
But it's awfully not
And your probably full of shit
Thank you for the light
Now I'm draped in all black
With an empty Jack bottle and with a logo on my hat
Always and forever, just know I got your back
I will die for you homie just to put it like that
Nothing here is fake so deep down you know
There's no limit I won't go
If I have to let it show
Words can't express how I feel
Pain will linger, some wounds never heal

[Hook]
Because I'm living in a world where the sun don't shine
And the sound of a shot might blow a nigga's mind
If you really wanna know (If you really wanna know)
If you really wanna know (I don't think you wanna know)
Because I'm living in a world where the sun don't shine
And the sound of a shot might blow a nigga's mind
If you really wanna know (If you really wanna know)
If you really wanna know (I don't think you wanna know)

[Verse 2]
See I remember when we first met
Middle school thumpin'
Biggest homie on the block
Only one dunkin'
Mushroom cut on a six foot frame
Stretched out colored tee
With a barbecue stain
Yes Big B I remember those days
They will never leave me
Or lead me astray
I fight and I feel your pain
But no matter what I do
This shit will not go away!
I wish that it would all go away!
I wish god would listen every time that I pray
I'm speechless but there's so much to say
Every day is a blessin' but I'm living in the shade
And hope is all I got left
How can I be alive when I have to greet death
Everything ripe rots
I guess it is what it is
It just ain't what you thought

[Hook]
Because I'm living in a world where the sun don't shine
And the sound of a shot might blow a nigga's mind
If you really wanna know (If you really wanna know)
If you really wanna know (I don't think you wanna know)
Because I'm living in a world where the sun don't shine
And the sound of a shot might blow a nigga's mind
If you really wanna know (If you really wanna know)
If you really wanna know (I don't think you wanna know)

[Verse 3]
Now I'm haunted by nightmares from the past
Like the time we got drunk to go ride in the van
Swervin' in and out of lanes
With your foot on the gas
Full speed down the street
Lost control then crashed
And all I can see was broken glass
I was sprawled on the pavement layed out pitch black
I woke up saw your face on the dash
Heard you yell my name but I was out so fast
Now there's nothing in life we can't cope with
I don't give a fuck about a doctor's diagnosis
Paranoid skitzo, manic depression
Can not hold back a candid confession
To you B comin' truly from the heart
I'll be there till the end
Cause you were there from the start
From a brotha to anotha
You'll never have to suffer
Cause you will always have your brothas
