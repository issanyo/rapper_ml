[Intro]
Yeah. I know the closest ones to me counted me out a long time ago, I do. You know that's okay, it's somewhat understandable. You know if you don't know me, you know that is understandable. But if you knew what I had to overcome to get to this point right now, it'd be a different story. I'm just excited to start this new chapter. You know I really am. It's a lot different now. And I think you can feel that too

[Verse]
See I'm a post a link and you gon' hear the difference
Thought I was falling off and I'm the one that's driven
Old friends getting married and they're having children
You feel my windows closing and the clock is ticking
Shit, I'm so used to that now
My own brother feels the same and he's no longer around
He left town and we barely talk
I do my best to try to reach him but I'm at a loss
And lord knows we been through a lot
Mom was homeless, barefoot walking city blocks
She got sick and we got picked up by the fucking cops
I was too young to understand
I'm just grateful that we have this chance to do it all over again
And build something we never have
Address the questions that are hard to ask
All of the memories that held us back
I guess we're scarred by the past
But I learned to let go and I'm comfortable where I'm at and who I've become
You lost faith when I found it, I'ma get it done
Refine the brand, mobilize the fans, make a run
Campaign, acquire the funds, assemble the team
Might even get dad to beat on the drums cause we got a ride
I got some dues to pay, I know it's gonna take some time
But I've been working on myself preparing for the ride
You won't believe it til you hear it
Me and B got something nice, I let the vibe provide the lyrics cause I'm in the zone
You hear that Zoe, I said I'm in the zone
I do this shit for Josh, Jen, do this shit for O
You hung it up before it cracked
Now you're faded with the masters while I'm mastering these tracks
You know where I'm at
When the best to never do it gets the urge to rap
I'm up the street, the door is open, you don't have to ask
The gambling has been a mess but bet the house on me, tell everyone at the shop I am next

[Outro]
Wow, wow
Life is so wild, man
I know I'ma catch a lot of people off guard with this, I know, I know
But I'm giving you every part of me, every part of me
Yeah, I'm all in
We are all in
Oh man
