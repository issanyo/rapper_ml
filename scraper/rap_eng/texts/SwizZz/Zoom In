[Verse 1]
Yo
I popped out like titties in a catfight
It's time to get acquainted to the fast life
Dumb niggas get left like a voicemail
So I could give a fuck what your cash like
That's right, I'm so different I might Act right
Rolling like the wheels on a halfpipe
Headed to shoot up your school campus
And rush to your temple and pop the Rabbi
Don't get your panties in a bunch - Brady
Lately I've been having a hunch
My nigga is talking about me behind my back (Damn)
How you gon' do me like that? (Look)
I learned that loyalty is rare
And most niggas can't afford it (Yep)
You attained a little success and assumed your best friend wants a portion (No)
See I don't need a handout when I standout all by myself
And when I do help, I expect nothing in return
Motherfucker, it's just how I'm built
No shame on the shelf is left
I'mma feed these niggas
My mouth is a chopper, boy, and I'mma squeeze that trigger
Anybody can get it
I ain't talking to anybody specific
Your mom and dad, or the team that's with ya
Motivated by the love, inspired by the hate
Gossiping is futile cause it doesn't change a thing
Addicted to the feel, attracted to the chase
I'm rushing to the top, I'll meet you at the block (Yep)
Say it louder
Flow so sweet, make a nigga turn sour
Patch kids, we active and we on it
It took a little while, but I'm commin'

[Hook]
Open wide and I'mma feed you
When you talk that shit, don't be surprised what it leads to
Nobody's here to compromise or please you and truth be told, dumb niggas, we don't need to
I'm in the lane by my lonely, still movin'
Not affected by the phonies, still movin'
Making it right with my homies, still movin'
Zoom in, nigga, come and take a look at it

[Verse 2]
Now zoom in and take a look at it
It's been a minute since I left, but I'm still at it
Still a savage, just had to kick a couple habits
Now niggas straight-jacket
Insane with the flow, bitch
On the grind, working both shifts
I'm the one, yeah, no shit
"I heard FV was in my city and I'm staring at the flier
And all I see is Hop and Dizzy, I wonder why no SwizZz"
Well, I've been dwelling on the same thing
Contemplating my motive and what the fame brings
Family drama made it difficult to maintain
Tired of my dad tripping, urging me to change lanes (Fuck)
He's telling me I shouldn't have left school
I ain't cut out to be a rapper (Yep)
Plus I only have a year and a half left, I should go back and get my Bachelor's
Now thanks for the input, but I been put here to carry out a motherfucking vision
I know youâ€™re concerned and your worry created doubt
I hear you but I refuse to listen
LISTEN! I'm itchin' to get involved, overlooked and underrated, ready to kill'em all
Obligated to the fans who waited, anticipating, remain impatient for me to get my shit together and release a damn song
Wrong, I'm right were I belong (Where's that?)
Heavenly pot, whose kush inside the bong
Trouble on my mind, got the world in my palm
Ink spilling on the page, lettin' life correspond
I'm still moving, I'm still romping (Yep)
I'm still the loony nigga, shit talking (Yep)
I still got three Z's on the name ho
And still reppin' the West, in case you ain't know

[Hook]
