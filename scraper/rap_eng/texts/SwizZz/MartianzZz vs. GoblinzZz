[Intro]
SwizZz
Ha, number six

[Verse 1]
Funk volume kill them all
AK's and molotovs
Militant minds I'm getting strapped ready to set it off
I crash landed on this planet attacking like panic
Z'd talking. I'm in assembling hammocks
You ain't a martian goon, goblin goon, or a beast
But you might return a ghost if you press your luck with me
I forced game to tat a Z on his other cheek
Made him claim he was a Crip and jacked his mother fucking beat
He sobbed on the floor, threw a tantrum and wept
Like when 50 bullied him and stole his royalty checks (He reps the west though!)
Well I don't give a shit, Thomas
So does Dre and I slapped him with a waffle iron
He pushed Detox back too many times
When it drops he'll be 59
Popping Cialis and going blind
Better late than never right?
Hey, Wayne, tell them why your grill looks like crushed ice

[Hook]
Bitch, I'm a mother fucking martian! (Martian!)
I'm a god damn goblin
(repeat 3x)
Mother fucking martian! (Martian!)
I'm a god damn goblin
We are not the same I am a martian

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I left a voice mail for Shady
While he was at the movies with Hailie that made him angry
I questioned why he only disses boy groups and divas
Pop bands and singers, like Mariah and Christina
What the fuck is that about?
He's a legendary lyricist
That gets an orgasm from bashing females with a clitoris
I'll fucking ball gag him
Rope him to a lawn chair, drag his ass to Super Cuts
Bleach back his blonde hair
I don't care or give a fuck about your views
Shit, I should've replaced Glenn Beck in Fox News
Because I can propagandize and bullshit, too
Spread hate, divide a country, and fabricate the truth
And if that isn't enough (what?)
Watch me turn it up (Up!)
Get my Diddy on and rape an artist for his bucks (Bucks!)
Sentence Wiz Khalifa to rehab and take his blunt
Hey, Wayne, tell them why you drink that purple stuff

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We are not the same, I am a different breed
Swizzle's official, I'm ejecting niggas, and call and tease
A crack head, I devolved into a fucking fiend
Snort and rock nation wearing Sean John long sleeves
Kellie Rowland was desperate to lay it on me
She booked the sweetest Caesar's I supplied the bomb weed
We were drinking, smoking
Rubbing in exotic lotion
Until she spread her monkey and it smelled like sardines
I rock shows with nothing but a snuggie on
Dropping bombs like wide receivers with butter fingers and sweaty palms
Come on and keep your hands up pal, or get mopped like Ortiz
With a two-piece to the mouth, scream, holler and shout
Then whisper, mumble, murmur
The FDA should prohibited fatasses from buying burgers
From Jack 'n' the Box and Hardees
McDonald's, Wendy's and Arby's
God damn I'm ready to party
Wayne, tell 'em what you are

[Hook]
