Yo, Z to the third
Eight shots down
We celebrate
Pour another round
Not on my tab
Nigga fuck that
(Hey, come on bro!)
Alright fine, just pay me back
I don't got racks, check the Carfax
I push the Queen CL with the tires flat
I ride dirty (Like what?) My draws'
I eat chicken (With what?) Hot sauce (That's right!)
I bet you never seen some shit like this
I pulled up like 50, yellin' "Bitch get in!"
I got a two dollar bill, a brand new grill
George Foreman, so I cook em playa, that's just how I feel
Cause uhm

CHORUS:
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yep, I'm SwizZle bitch (Who?)
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yeah, I'm SwizZzle bitch (Who?)
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yes, I'm SwizZzle bitch (Who?)
And I still count to ten on my finger tips
Let's go
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yep, I'm SwizZle bitch (Who?)
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yeah, I'm SwizZzle bitch (Who?)
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yes, I'm SwizZzl-(Wait a minute, you're SwizZle's bitch?)
No, I'm SwizZle BITCH

See, you're retarded
Need a helmet when you walk the boulevard
Morning wood on the beat, I go hard
Jacking Vizios from the back of Wal-Mart
So holler if you need a TV, 42 inch flat screen LCD
Niggas trying to hang like grandma's titties
But they can't see me like a hickey on Diddy
I got the peanut butter and the bread
I even got the memory foam up on the bed
So when it's lunch time, (What?) you know I eat good (Oh)
And when it's bed time, (What?) you know I sleep good (Oh)
Yeah, a nigga hit 50 thou
Lights on the page, I'm a streak for a mile
Frank the Tank, it's about to get wild
Just smile, I'mma tell you who I am right now, listen

CHORUS:
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yep, I'm SwizZle bitch (Who?)
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yeah, I'm SwizZzle bitch (Who?)
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yes, I'm SwizZzle bitch (Who?)
And I still count to ten on my finger tips
Let's go
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yep, I'm SwizZle bitch (Who?)
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yeah, I'm SwizZzle bitch (Who?)
I'm SwizZzle bitch, yes, I'm SwizZzle-(Wait a minute, you're SwizZle's bitch?)
No, I'm SwizZle BITCH
