[Chorus: SwizZz]
I've been going so hard just to get a taste of the fame
Tryna make it big so I can erase the pain
Had to start from somewhere so I'm gunna chase the game
Had to hunt it down and make some space for me to place my name
I've been going so hard just to get a taste of the fame
Tryna make it big so I can erase the pain
Had to start from somewhere so I'm gunna chase the game
Had to hunt it down and make some space for me to place my name

[Verse 1: Dilz]
Yo, my name is Dilz and I’m gonna be creative
Wasn’t happy with my verse, so I’m gonna recreate it
Think they’re sleeping on me still, soon I’m gonna be sedated
But this honesty is sacred and they promised me I’ll make it
Fame is like a flavour and I made a plan to taste it
Make them drop their jaw fuck they’re gonna need a face lift
Cheque of reality is how I’m giving pay slips
Boss in this bitch, going off in this bitch
Tell them get fucked now they tugging on their foreskin
Obi-Wan Kenobi cus it’s almost like I forced them
Your mother and your sister and her mate that’s a foursome
When I taste the fame I’ll be making me a fortune
I ambush like I claim I was a president
The message is your messing with somebody never hesitant
To give it all he’s got now I dare you like some venison
They say my flow is sick no prescribing it with medicine
And when my time comes take me to the crematorium
Here it gets important so ensure there is an audience
Request I have an urn not to use it as an ornament
After this has happened take a handful of my ashes
Ensure that these are rationed to your list of favourite rappers
They’ll stand in a circle on a windy day in Wellington
Their hands wide open now we reach the point I’m telling them
Even when I’m dust in the gusts of the strongest winds
You’ll never blow me away
Slowly the day is coming where they know me okay
Until then watch me jump on a stage
Rip a mic like it’s paper while they’re screaming my name

[Chorus: SwizZz]
I've been going so hard just to get a taste of the fame
Tryna make it big so I can erase the pain
Had to start from somewhere so I'm gunna chase the game
Had to hunt it down and make some space for me to place my name
I've been going so hard just to get a taste of the fame
Tryna make it big so I can erase the pain
Had to start from somewhere so I'm gunna chase the game
Had to hunt it down and make some space for me to place my name

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
Hello world, what it do, it's Swizzle-bitch and I'm on
I'm a friendly guy, I might walk my dog or let him shit all over your lawn
I'm sorry if I'm not, reserve me a spot
Right next to that guy who thinks he is on top
Look I'm coming for you niggas and I won't slow up
If the offer isn't right then I won't show up
Under pressure Imma beast and I won't fold up
If you wanna get high then fruit roll up
Yup my swagger got niggas looking to scatter, cause they heard I am an animal
It's not a secret Imma beast, just look at the letters on my sweater I'm rockin orange like a cantaloupe
Now that's an F and a V, but you can read it as a F and a U
Cause it's "fuck you" if you don't move
We coming down the lane so you better make room
That's right make way
It's SwizZzle, Dilz, and Nay Nay
You take a shot and we'll block it, something like Nay Nay
I'm not mess in around with JK's
Everything is real that we say
You might not get it the first time, or get it the second time
But go ahead and hit replay

[Chorus: SwizZz]
I've been going so hard just to get a taste of the fame
Tryna make it big so I can erase the pain
Had to start from somewhere so I'm gunna chase the game
Had to hunt it down and make some space for me to place my name
I've been going so hard just to get a taste of the fame
Tryna make it big so I can erase the pain
Had to start from somewhere so I'm gunna chase the game
Had to hunt it down and make some space for me to place my name

[Outro: Dilz & SwizZz]
I've been going so hard just to get a taste of fame
Tryin to make it big so I can erase the pain
Had to start from somewhere so I'm gunna chase the game
Had to hunt it down and make some space for me to place my name
Yup
