(Dilz - Intro)
To anyone trying to bring me down, thank you for nothing

(Dilz - Verse 1)
I’ve been down and out but got up for the count, see it’s me against the world and I’m loving this bout, out of all my 20 rounds it’s the strongest I’ve felt and even though my pants are up look I’m after the belt, if your standing in my way it’s nothing personal, there’s very few that I trust so my circles small, and no one else matters to me they’re just John Does, I’ll put them to the test and they’ll fail like they’re John Jones, I’m bout to steal the show like kidnapping an actor, when you picture me rising, imagine a rapture, passions a factor that they seem to neglect, I don’t have to flip a coin to be seeing ahead, and I don’t need a camera for me to picture the finish, if your witness just know that I’ll be up in a flash, now those in my way are on a list like it’s Shindler’s, forgiveness I was out with a sickness now I’m back it’s a wrap

(Dilz - Hook)
It’s show time got my head in the game, I said it’s show time they’ll remember the name, at the end of the day, you’ll be hearing them say, that I went and stole the stage I was ready to play, I said it’s show time got my head in the game, I said it’s show time they’ll remember the name, at the end of the day, you’ll be hearing them say, that I went and stole the stage I’ma do it again

(SwizZz - Verse 2)
Yo it’s go time, show time, I’m not shameless, a couple bars that might heal your anguish, no need to be famous, I’m doing this for survival, but it comes with the territory so I’m glad to be your idol, you can follow and listen and learn something, twist and then burn something, relax, let go, swizZzle and Dilz running the show, I’ve been on the road rarely working, nothing in life is certain, but this feeling that fills me up when it’s curtains, I’ll be ready to fly, wings spread painting the sky, no limits exist, this moment is bliss, I’m enjoying the ride, a couple set backs, a couple let downs, allow me to develop my sound, go ‘head and turn this up loud, and let it knock, coming for a second shot, don’t be shocked, bad boy we will never stop, stop with the questions, I let loose on these sessions, three z’s I’m still repping, going hard because it’s show time, yup

(Dilz - Hook)
