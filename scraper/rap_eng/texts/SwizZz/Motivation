[SwizZz]
SwiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiizZz!

[T-Pain]
Yeah, (yeah)
Yeah, (yeah)

[Intro - SwizZz]
Boom!
It's Young Fyre on the motherfucking beat, yep
And Nappy Boy colliding with FV
(Yeah, Yeah)

[Verse 1 - T-Pain]
Uhh
Throw me in a cage with a lion and a bear
I'm a kill it, that motivation, I ain't lying, I swear
I'm the nigga, I got my ear to the streets, back to the bullshit
I'm trying to eat, I'm on my bullshit
Homie I can't listen to what you saying, stop talking
Better watch the way you talk to my clay and homie start walking
But a minute, when the nigga really get it, ever go off, I got to prove it to him
I think I'm big meat, that ripple bomb

[Hook - T-Pain]
I'm trying to eat, you trying to sleep
If you a dog, then I'm a beast
And the beat goes
I know you hate it, here go my motivation
Bro, I'm with my dolls, fuck us? no nigga, fuck y'all
And the beat goes
If you know they hate it, let me get you motivated

[Verse 2 - SwizZz]
Gyeah!
Ayy T-Peezy let me borrow your hat for this real quick player
Go!
My fans know I'm like a ref with a cape
Super official, I'm SwizZzle, putting it down for my state
Lock me in the cage with a lion, I'm sealing its fate
I'll bear hug him 'till he's breathless, squeeze his back 'till it breaks
Cause I'm a beast, I'm a monster, squashing niggas on any roster
I'm after the title and I'm a conquer, (what?)
The whole world, tuck it tight in my hands
Hurdle the pile, break the plane, and throw it off in the stands
I'm celebrating nigga, if you're craving something you snatch it
Why you waiting nigga, time is wasting as you're relaxing
While you faking nigga, I'm balling out like my scrotum pop
I'm a giant, shaking the turf, when I storm the block
Witness a champion fight to the top, nothing was given, I'm running my spot
I welcome the shorty, you sleep on your hustle, you niggas ain't ready for nothing I got
Go 'head and label me number 2, I am the shit
Ay Freaknik, can we turn the volume up a bit?
Nappy boy!

[Hook]
