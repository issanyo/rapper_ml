Yo, huh, yo

[Chorus]
Ay tell me I am different if you feel that I have changed
Maybe I'm undifferent just adapting to this pain
You judging from a distance when there's always more to say
You refuse to listen, turn your back and walk away
But let me know I'm different if you feel that I have changed
Homie I'm undifferent just adapting to this pain
You judging from a distance when there's always more to say
You're too busy talking I hold back and give you space

[Verse 1]
I told you from the start we are in this shit together
If I'ma shine then you gon' shine we'll tackle our endeavors
The love that I extended is something you cannot measure
I considered you a brother, I exhausted all my efforts
Tryin' help your ass out, neglected my own problems
Late night talks to convince you to keep ballin'
We all know what's your calling
But your ego got the best dressed
Blowing heavy weed smoke out your fucking chest
Damn waiting on the next handout to take advantage
You wasted every fucking opportunity you were handed
Did your thing at Cal Poly and you should've took the offer overseas
But you were stuck in your feelings and impossible to plead
False needs got you begging for acceptance
That bullshit that you pulled was an answer to all my questions
I forgive and love you homie
But it's really fuck you homie
We are done for good and know your absence is a fucking blessing

[Chorus]
Tell me I am different if you feel that I have changed
Maybe I'm undifferent just adapting to this pain
You judging from a distance when there's always more to say
You refuse to listen, turn your back and walk away
But let me know I'm different if you feel that I have changed
Homie I'm undifferent just adapting to this pain
You judging from a distance when there's always more to say
You're too busy talking I hold back and give you space

[Verse 2]
We opened our door to you when you and Dino were beefin’
My dad used to feed you, provided a bed to sleep in
Every weekend we were tryin’ creep
Sneakin’ girls inside the house
Gettin’ pregame, postgame drunk and wildin’ out
Drivin’ back from santa barbra nearly barreled off a cliff
We feel asleep at the wheel and we slowly started to drift
Like shit, what a trip, so many bullets we dodged
Bailed you outta jail in Mexico, thankful to god
You can never tell how much I admired you, D
You were a problem for defenders automatic from three
Came from the gutter but you handled and you got your degree
But after slow you hit a wall and it was tragic to see
I lost sleep tryin’ give your ass perspective
That bullshit that you pulled was an answer to all my questions
I forgive and love you homie
But it’s really fuck you homie
We are done for good and know your absence is a fucking blessing

[Chorus]
Tell me I am different if you feel that I have changed
Maybe I'm undifferent just adapting to this pain
You judging from a distance when there's always more to say
You refuse to listen, turn your back and walk away
But let me know I'm different if you feel that I have changed
Homie I'm undifferent just adapting to this pain
You judging from a distance when there's always more to say
You're too busy talking I hold back and give you space

[Verse 3]
I was speechless, I couldn’t fuckin’ believe it when I first got the news
Didn't know what to do, so distraught and confused
Like what the fuck, is this true?
All the shit we been through
You’re a fuckin’ monster homie, your transgression is proof
Do not tell me you’re sorry
We both know that you’re not
Your eyes contradict your words the fuckin’ second you talk
The obligated remorse
I ain’t shakin’ it off
Your apology was a joke, don’t wanna hear it at all
So your presence became a burden, your texts were hard to respond
You’re desperate to find a place in a circle you don’t belong
A friendship you don’t deserve, the coat we keep is too strong
There’s nothing you can say to rekindle our fucking bond
I’m gone but you know that’s just expected
That bullshit that you pulled was the answer to all my questions
I forgive and love you homie
But it’s really fuck you homie
We are done for good and know your absence is a fucking blessing

[Chorus]
Tell me I am different if you feel that I have changed
Maybe I'm undifferent just adapting to this pain
You judging from a distance when there's always more to say
You refuse to listen, turn your back and walk away
But let me know I'm different if you feel that I have changed
Homie I'm undifferent just adapting to this pain
You judging from a distance when there's always more to say
You're too busy talking I hold back and give you space
