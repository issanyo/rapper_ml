[Verse 1:SwizZz]
Yo
If I had one wish, I'd probably wish I didn't have it
I'm good to go, all I need to proceed is a beat and watch a nigga get active
I can force A.I. to go to practice
I'm the reason why your son is missing classes
Ditching school everyday to get laid by a babe with a booty like Stacy Dashes
Hey homie (yea), are you ready? (yea), Well I really don't give a shit (maan)
I'm going in like it's cold outside, now come get right and have a sip of this
Little nigga I'm drinking and I'm driving
Don't touch my keys you wildin'
The only nigga navigating my car when I depart is me
Tonight I'm riding yup
I'm a fire spitter, I can melt a nigga like a snow cone sitting in the sun yo
What the fuck I need a gun fo'?
I put yo ass in a headlock and slam you like a car door
I know you see the black eyes, but you don't wanna' leave with a black eye
Fuck around too much, and you just might
I'll knock you out, wake you up and knock you out twice
Ayo it's really hard acting like I'm down to earth
When I'm high as fuck off this pound of purp
On another planet at a lost of words
Mumbling on the beat because I forgot my verse
Like, ayo yo bango back aye eh oh! I'm back on track
No Jansport but I can put the game on my back and run a couple hundred miles in the sand in Iraq
Labels only want your money so I had to adapt
Went to college for three years then I called it a wrap
Moved back to the valley and decided to rap
Now it's time to put my fucking city up on the map
Hey, Come get me, I'm ready
I kick it, like Messi
No scantron, don't test me
I'll break you, don't press me *heeyah*
My flow is nice like it shares with people
What's mine is yours, you're all invited, I'll love to treat you jeeyah
