[Intro: Hopsin]
How you like me now?
How you like me now?
Yeah, how you like now?
I'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!
WOW!

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
Yo! So I'ma flop? Nah, that's where you guys are wrong
I shit on niggas, that's why I rap with a diaper on
Don't be approaching me with none of your mess
Talking 'bout where I belong
Just tell your friends all about me and sit
And watch as they minds get blown
Niggas on that basic shit, now I'ma go ape a bit
I know y'all prayed for this, so don't trip
Here's a handkerchief for your razored wrists
My flow got a few ways to switch
Niggas act hard, I'ma change the script
Everybody begging to be a buddy of mine
'Cause they know I got skills y'all can't prevent
When I lace a hit you impressive, none
You can take it as a lesson, son
If you was smart, you'd drop the mic and
Try to stick up a bank with a weapon drawn
Pillow Man was slept upon
That's the reason the West was gone
But I set the bomb, when it blows up
You niggas will know where the heck I'm from
I'm keeping it raw fo' sho', flow so diabolical
You all should know that it took like 10 whole years
Just for my balls to grow
No overnight success, I'm struggling just to write this mess
The road to righteousness was more than words and skill that I possess

[Hook: Hopsin]
I was the nigga all you niggas used to clown
Now when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like "Wow!"
Yeah, how you like me now?
I'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!
Ayo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Yo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Ayo! Let me see you clown, motherfuckers
Let me see..
Yeah! How you like me now, motherfuckers (Guess who it is!)
How you like me...

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
Ayo! S-W-I-Z-Z and add another
My swagger makes your girl want to cut, like upper
I'm mad hot, dog, my 16s should come with mustard
If you think I have a big head, then you haven't see my brother!
Stacked bad niggas swore I wouldn't make it rappin'
Promised it couldn't happen and hated with a passion
A mixtape later I silenced their laughing
Now the same ones would probably suck my dick if I asked 'em
It's obvious I have it locked like CAPS
Rocking to a bitch fight beat that slaps
I do it major, Poly Sci & Bio
I don't have haters only fans in denial
Now gimme a minute to hop in my zone, I'm making 'em pop like Mary
I'm rocking the party to act all retarded, I'm making 'em pop like cherries
I know this nigga is wild, but I will knock him down
Just answer this question for me:
How you like me, how you like me now?

[Hook: Hopsin]
I was the nigga all you niggas used to clown
Now when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like "Wow!"
Yeah, how you like me now?
I'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!
Ayo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Yo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Ayo! Let me see you clown, motherfuckers
Let me see..
Yeah! How you like me now, motherfuckers
How you like me...

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
Oh, so you wanna be cool? You wanna be pals?
You wanna be closest friends?
See a nigga so hot, that's why I'm popping up
Like I'm toaster bread
I say shit that don't get said
That's why I can't roll with feds
Illuminati got they eye on me
And they gon' see to it that a nigga don't get fed
My purpose ain't hard to see
I pull up on rappers like "pardon me
Your bars are weak, you put too much time
Tryna get your sparkling charm to bling"
I be kickin' 'em multiple syllables
Ripping up shows and holding my genitals
Get a dose of the wicked flow before your niggas run up
Saying "Homie, you should've known"
It's crazy how life can switch
I ain't gonna lie to you mine was shit
Not anymore, shit changed up
From woman selection to size of tits
I know bitches who can ride the dick
Niggas who think that my eyes are sick
Showing 'em many agents who be loving
The melodies that I supply them with
Yo! I gotta a note for all y'all
In the rap game who got an album stacking dough
Y'all got big, chains'll start falling off like Michael Jackson's nose
Who the illest? Y'all know
Hopsin, yeah, bravo
I'm 'bout to leave the building right now
AbadeAbade that's all folks

[Hook: Hopsin]
I was the nigga all you niggas used to clown
Now when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like "Wow!"
Yeah, how you like me now?
I'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!
Ayo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Yo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Ayo! Let me see you clown, motherfuckers
Let me see..
Yeah! How you like me now, motherfuckers
How you like me...

[Outro: SwizZz]
Let me ask you niggas something
How you like me ha?
All you motherfuckers used to hate talk that shit
How you like me?
I know I haven't made a check
But I get more than you bitch-ass
I talkin' on the song like it's my track and shit
Sorry Hop for takin' it over, but I had to
I mean I didn't have to but - holla at me
You know what it is?
Funk Volume
One more time for y'all, Funk Volume
