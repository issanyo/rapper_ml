[Verse 1: SwizZz]
Yeah yeah yea, come on, uh huh
Ayo I promise you this if the money starts componding
I'll humbly stay grounded
Try my best to come around it, kick it with my niggas thats been down since day one equally share the fun straight lounging
I ain't shit without y'all
I rob for the cause despite it's my down fall
I die for my dawgs cause I'm down by law
It's a code that I keep, and it's hard like raw, but ever know
If I ever show a second slow when you need me
I'm face down in a palm pot believe me
You need a hand heres a hand out come, and see me
Thats why I'm here for support, and to make it easy (yup)
To many friends turn enemies, over bullshit like jealiousy
Females, and infidelity
Can make you lose focus fast
And your only gonna notice when your lonely on your ass
Theres no missed calls nor voice mails neither
Beggining to feel your friendships growing weaker
But that doesn't matter you'll do anything to keep her
Even if it means fucking up all you have in life!
Now look at all that you sacrificed
Moving to fast to bag a wife
You lost your best friends, and destroyed your chance to go to school
All because of that you were blinded, and she played you like a fool
Now it's rare that the love just goes
My best friends just walked out the door
Oh why is this world so cold?
How could I prosper? how could I prosper? (arah)
