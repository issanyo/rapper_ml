Now scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream

[SwizZz: Verse 1]
Gyeah
I'm in the cut, SwizZzle, for sure
Now open the door, it's time to get low
To the motherfucking blow, but this nigga don't dance
Bullshit, I be ripping it up with both hands
Like gee, let a nigga just get in his zone
Shot of patron, and big blunt to carry on
I'm ill in Wayne's World, and strange in mine
You feel like I feel, it's about that time, (for what?)
Clock him, we about to go to work
If you scared, go to church
No shirts and no skirts is needed
Better believe it
What you know about the dress code
Bare backs and tatoos, baby let's go
Turn the lights off, it's going down here
You ain't a freak, why the fuck you come around here?
Put a smile on your face, be happy, (C'mon)
Do me a favor, (what?) scream at me

[SwizZz: Hook]
Now scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream
Now scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream

[SwizZz: Verse 2]
Gyeah
Still balling
Nutty like an almond
Fuck walking in, I'm coming through crawling
Is that your chick on the dance floor, wyling?
Hmm, yes that's about a fifth long island
No homie, you should do the right thing
Take her home and go to sleep, you are in the wrong scene
If not, it's a rap, I'm a get it cause she needs it
And throw her on the trap, like a mother fucking reednicks
There's no rules, no regulations
We got jack for a tonic, and chronic for medication,okay
You like fun, then good, take a vacation
Come to the west side and fully participate in
(What?) A romp sesh, bong no, a beer fest
No drama, no stress, I could care less
But if there really is a problem then swing on em
Matter fact, fuck that, just scream on em!

[SwizZz/Hopsin: Hook]
Now scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream
Now scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream
(Hopsin) I've lost my fucking mind, I think that it's time that you do the same

[SwizZz: Verse 3]
Gyeah
Now who said that they ain't gone ride
With the boss like SwizZz, throw your doves in the sky
I ain't gotta live life like a bitch, I'm a get it
Funk Volume, turn it up, get with it
I'm with it for sure than, you can bring both friends
Pass till you pass out, we leaving in the morning
Shit's real, baby girl I'm zoning
You can take a shot, or a cock, pick a poison
Now baby girl do you really think I mean that?
You're wrong, so what's it gonna be then?
I'm just playing, you know I really am that guy, girl
I just want to get you loose, welcome to my world
It's like that, oh, it's really like this now
I got a weird seize, I can make a flat ball bounce
No doubt, motherfuckers, I mean this
Get the fuck up, let go, start screaming!

[SwizZz: Hook]
Now scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream
Now scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream, scream
