Zoom In take a look at it

Talking about my flow because you don't have it

Being mean cause you're just average

X you out cause I have no heart - 21 Savage

Break your neck on the beat like some hard dabbing

They say King's Dead, but I'm still laughing

On Thursday, I get my check and I'm gonna cash it

I'm not about that Fashion

You half as good as me fraction

Put your Face in a Book, Get that gram fast that's insta, but I'm still snapping

Like rice krispies
I snap, crackle, pop

UFC, I don't want to fight in the octagon and it's time to stop

I see some nice Nike's I'm gonna cop
I won't stop until I'm on top and I drop like someone witnessing a robbery

That's a crime

Sprite that's lemon-lime

Look at the watch, it's looking like my time

Got some Tea, it's my Thyme
I'm on this bus
Good Rappers out here looking like Joel and Ellie that's the Last Of Us

I have to rap and let out my feelings on this paper it's a must

Counting my money "In God We Trust"

But what if I'm Greg Oden I'm a bust?

I just know when my time comes ima bust

I'm feeling lust with this rap game

I need to fix my flow because I rap lame

I have no shame
I have no fame
JC, you ain't cut out to be a rapper

You know Slim Jesus
Well you're wacker
Why do you always rap faster?

You're setting yourself up for disaster

I have no worries. Because in Psychology I'm getting my masters

I see fake love you guys are good actors

The love and listens is all that matters

And I really appreciate it all
Cause you know
I don't treat this rapping seriously

Just if you were wondering curiously
Coming at me in my comments furiously

I block out the hate

It motivates me to do my best

Like studying before a test

I get 100 percent

To show that I'm better than the rest

I record over and over

Holding these bars so much I have a sore shoulder

I said my wrist was icy well it's just getting colder

Colder than that new freezer

Colder than some old pizza

Colder than Ice

I need a new mic

But I gotta treat my girl first cause she's more important and that's right

More important than this rap life
4 years and counting. That's longer than some of y'all been in high school

I'm sorry I don't rap about smoking weed because getting high's cool

I love doing Remixes
I can't do every single one perfect

But I have fun trying to mimic their styles it's so worth it

It's a sign of the times that beats make artist

Without a hot beat, your favorite artist would sound garbage

I'm in my corner Richard Sherman

I'm not the greatest in the game but I'm still learning

I'm observing

That's for certain

Close the curtains

I'm putting on my best performance

We gotta thank DJ Mustard, Sonny Digital and Metro Boomin

They're part of the great producer movement

I'm taking over Harry Truman

I may be new but I know what I'm doing

I'm too far I can't see my haters

I gotta zoom in

I'll see you later
