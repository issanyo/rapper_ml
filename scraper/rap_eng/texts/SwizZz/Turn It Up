[Intro: Hopsin]
And I just came to get down, don't be hatin' on me!
Bounce and move on my way, the parties waitin' for me!

[Verse 1: Hopsin]
I'ma go buck wild in this bitch like I'm shameless sin
Then act a fool on the flo' like my brain missin'
I can't listen, but listen to me!
Put ya hands in the sky if you got similar needs as I do
I move like a shadow in the night
Tacklin' the mic like I really have to get a bite
I see niggas stuffin' weed in a apple gettin' high
Feelin' like they livin' in that castle in the sky
Nooow I'm usually in life of parties
With a broke down whip, no nice Ferrari
Skater boys are like "DUDE, YOUR EYES ARE GNARLY!"
Everybody come ride my safari!
Get a taste of the new, when the bass hit ya shoes
I'm just here to start a movement the fascist didn't do
Come here girl 'cause I really wanna taste some of you
And take you back to the crib and put my face in ya ewwww

[Hook: Hopsin]
And I just came to get down, don't be hatin' on me!
Bounce and move on my way, the parties waitin' for me!
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
Yo! Yo!
What? What? What?
Hey girl! It's time to release your inhibitions 'cause I have a secret
I like the way you move, kinda sneakin'
I got plans to take you home this evenin'
Now if you wanna ride, all you gotta do is agree
Ain't nobody in here fuckin' wit' me
You naked is somethin' to see
Plus, you and me...that's somethin' you need!
Ghyeaaah...but I ain't gonna front, tho
I am kinda drunk, yo
And I just wanna fuck, bust a nut - WOAH!
You say you ain't single, but yet you still mingle
One mo' drink and it's goin' down fo' SHO'!
No pressure, just cruise wit' it
It ain't your fault, say the motherfucking Goose did it!
Moderation doesn't exist
So while you finish your drink, I'm gonna guzzle a fifth, woah

[Hook: Hopsin]
And I just came to get down, don't be hatin' on me!
Bounce and move on my way, the parties waitin' for me!
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down

[Verse 3: Hopsin & SwizZz]
I'm the dopest, of course
Explosive and more
Now stomp 'til you put a fucking hole in the floor
I be bangin' my head, my necks broken and sore
Now I'm at the hospital like "OPEN THE DOOR!"
I'm outta my mind, and yes, you know this
Funk Volume's in the house wit' a new dope hit
Fill this motherfucker up wit' a few mo' chicks
And after the party, we'll take a new road trip
Yo Hop! (Whaddup?)
Turn this motherfucker up
I'm ready to get buck RIGHT NOW!
I'm kinda feelin' the flow, adrenaline doin' the most
This ceilin' goin' down RIGHT NOW!
See, I ain't gotta do dances 'n' shit
'Cause I could really care less how you dance to this
I just wanna see you move, break a sweat
Then dip like you from the set

[Bridge: Hopsin]
See, lately I've been stressed, tryin' to work my 9 to 5!
So it's good to step out the house once awhile and ease my mind!
Turn it up, get down
Turn it up, get down
Turn it up, get down
Turn it up, get down

[Hook: Hopsin]
And I just came to get down, don't be hatin' on me!
Bounce and move on my way, the parties waitin' for me!
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down
Turn it up, turn it up, get down, get down
