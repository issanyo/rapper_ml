[Verse 1: Raiza]
There's two things i hate, Hypocrites and backstabbers
Jealous people who feed off evil, Call the kidnappers
I'm killing shit i might just flip and cause a fucking scene
I'm sick with this like syphillis you can't get rid of me
I'm ripping shit, Got everybody on my dick
From your sister to your mother, Even your main bitch
I never claimed to be a gangster but what's worse than that?
A maniac in a padded room with a chainsaw and a baseball bat
You hate the fact that i attack the track with precision
I might come back and leave your body missing with no evidence, No fingerprints, No facial recognition
You can't fuck with me, Like a bitch on her period
All i need is a ski mask and duck tape, To make me look mysterious
So what's up now?
Say that shit loud
What do i need to do, Cut my dick off to show i'm not fucking around?
Take some advice and shut your motherfucking mouth

[Hook]
If you've got problems with me
We can settle this in the street
Say it to my face, Say it to my face
Say it to my motherfucking face
Do you really wanna see
What happens when you fuck with me
Say it to my face, Say it to my face
Say it to my face motherfucker

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
You see i'm robbing and i'm rolling
SwizZzle bitch i'm on it
Niggas wanna be friends cuz i'm a threat to my opponents
When you talk behind my back it indicates that you don't want it
Because fear is that component that leaves every nigga honest
And i'm honestly a monster
Intimidated most so they're hesitant to acting apprehensive to approach
If you wanna test the water bring your swimming trunks and floats
I'll leave you seeking to the deep end at the bottom of the floor
"On the bottom of the what?"
Shut up nigga just keep up with me
If your dick was in my ass you still couldn't fuck with me
No-homo i'm upperly
This beat is my lunch to eat
If i get the best of you just take a loss and let it be
I run it like an errand this shit's apparent
How you feel about me is evident from how you're staring
Well imma smile back won't get into all of that
Hi i'm SwizZzle i'm official from the westside from the left side of the map

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Raiza]
Hello, Does it look like i'm high?
Look into my eyes you're a pussy you've got nine lives
So i'll stab you nine times with nine knives with enough force to crack your motherfucking spine
All you do is dislike this and dislike that
All i know is you're a bitch and you must be sad
Relentless flow i react like a monster
Red bull gives me wings and i play cops and robbers
You're fucking with a lunatic i'll hang you on a crucifix
Leave your body six feet deep then go to your house and fuck your bitch
You think you're playing games till this shit gets real
When you're lying in a hospital bed and you can't squeal
Stop snitching i'm on a mission to fuck your life up
You didn't listen now you're wishing, But you're time's up
Did you listen to a word i said, Motherfucker
Flatline you're dead, Motherfucker

[Hook]
