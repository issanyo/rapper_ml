There's this thing for alcoholics called "the blackout" which isn't really a blackout
It's more like sleepwalking with activities
And I believe it's your conscience going into witness protection programs

[speech - Bill Hicks]
I have taken drugs before and uh...
...I had a real good time, sorry!

[Verse 1]
Let's take it back I used to be a cocky Caucasian
Hoppin' in and out of cop stations
Mind like an athlete on drugs
Thoughts always racin'
I'm Dr. Dre but I don't got no patients
But I gots [parts sprayin?] and I bust flows, gung ho
So drunk I intoxicate the front row
Rap's my addiction and it plugs holes
My lines leaves your face squashed up like a pugs nose
So I blew up in these flu bugs (shu-be-du-op)
So sick live the crowd even threw up
I moonwalk through life 'cus everything is fucking backwards
Mind running wild but needs muscle relaxers
Stomach is bubblin' acid
I'm 'bouta jack out til I blackout like I've been fucking redacted
I've had it all, adderall, trim-ethyl tabs in my bathroom so soft
It bombs minds
Like an atom bomb
So bring a truck I need to pick me up
The doc got me addicted to prescription drugs
That shrink my nuts
My shrink was nuts
'cus I was talking to prostitutes whenever things got tough
Overdosed on Viagra now my dick is stuck
Cool for porn but at funerals it just sucks
Give me ketamine, quitiapine, dimethyltryptamine
Tell em' pretty bitches got my dick as big as mini me
I'm sick (On sickle(?)) gon' make you think a little bit of spitting
Quickly gave you giggles like you think your brain been tickled
Take a little hit of me
Makes you feel like you had 60 hits of weed
That's true, I'm not a bad dude, if you act rude, I'm gonna come  (Achoo!) Get ya' outa histamines
Rappers shit their jeans like they on ayahuasca
And if I want your opinion then I'll ask ya
For rhyming the time, that pure Heisenberg, I am worse
Want to get high but they'll try my verse functions
Hits harder than Tyson's work
Now rapers make'n this disease seen
'cus I'm the cure

[Pre - Hook]
I'm the cure
I'm the cure

[Hook]
'cus I've been feeling all weird and
The world feels wrong to me
But music keeps us free from
The bullshit that they feed us
Lots of thoughts on your mind better leak it out
Turn this song up loud lets speak it out
I'm user friendly
I'm user friendly

[speech - Bill Hicks]
Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves

[verse 2]
It starts off as a pleasure in the brain
When ever you hang around and you leisure everyday
Whether your a mess and your upset or your in pain
It's better to medicate than whatever it is to blame
At least that's what we think when we do it
With peace and the relief we get through it
It's all good at first but don't misconstrue it
If you're escaping enough then it will leave you in ruins
Humans are a complex type of breed
With a lot of addictions in this life we lead
There's a level of a comfort we like to keep
But we never seem to know what the price will be
It's like consume, consume, consume, consume
Getting stepped on by the elephant in the room
Address it,  your head space is a hell of a tune
So use it or you could be left behind and fed to the wolves
I don't wanna be the one to tell you this
But excess is the pain of excellence
Whether it's television, drugs or another escape there's consequences you must face
And it may taste pure, so pure
Give it time it will become your
Addiction, just listen to me baby I'm the cure

[hook]
'cus I've been feeling all weird and
The world feels wrong to me
But music keeps us free from
The bullshit that they feed us
Lots of thoughts on your mind better leak it out
Turn this song up loud lets speak it out
Im user friendly
Im user friendly

[speech - Mitch Hedberg]
I used to do drugs, I still do, but I used to too

[verse 3]
Yo, I've been up for weeks searching for a fix
Something to numb the pain
My dresser is well equipped
With some shit that don't work no more
I'm so self absorbed
Another counselor and I'll hit the floor
My man once don't get it so I hide it from the surface
Searching for a purpose, making another purchase
Gotta get a refill
Need another dose
Don't know what normal is but this shit ain't even close
Maybe I can't close with the front I put up
Or maybe I should pose, just sit back and shut up
Who knows
I gotta roll with it, gotta get it done
Falling victim to a cycle that is hard to overcome
It started of as fun and turned into a habit
Devastated, medicated, everyday is a challenge
Losing my balance
Lately it's affecting my work
But no excuses, we gotta do it, keep it moving
'cus I'm the cure

[Bridge]
I've been waiting for so long, to feel free don't tempt me
It's been raining for so long, I don't feel, I'm empty
I've been up waiting all night, pacing, feel like i'm escaping
I feel it hurting and I'm burning, think the ceiling's fading
It's been a burden on my world, so turn them back against me
I feel it yearning, so I'm working it's the only safety

[verse 4]
I was born underneath the streetlight
Next to a Navajo Shaman puffing the peace pipe
Blowing a cloud of peyote smoke in my face straight blessing me
Of course she must've been foreshadowing my destiny
Mother was a crack whore named Stephanie
By the time I was four I was an accessory
No one ever respected me
Innocence was the recipe
Out the back of the pharmacy
Pseudo-ephedrine and methazine
By six I was a known dealer
At my daddies factory job next to the meal truck
Whites in my family needed class
Blacks all needed crack
I was like come on over and you can feel up
What you need
'cus I got it, I'm holding it i'm about it
My cousins love me 'cus I never judged them for what they shot into their veins
Black tar, as quick as a nascar
Need a fix? I can fix it quick, ' cus bitch im the cure

[Pre - Hook]
I'm the cure
I'm the cure
I'm the cure

[hook]
'cus I've been feeling all weird and
The world feels wrong to me
But music keeps us free from
The bullshit that they feed us
Lots of thoughts on your mind better leak it out
Turn this song up loud lets speak it out
I'm user friendly
I'm user friendly

[speech] - Robin Williams
You can change it any time you want, it's only a choice
No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now - between fear and love
And then you have to go: nope - you lose. You can't do it. You need help. And at that point, that's the beginning. And then, you know, once you do that, you're on your own
