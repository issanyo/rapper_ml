[Verse 1: Hopsin]
Yo, Since I was like five there's been nothing that I can comprehend
Ugly ass nigga, walk around with a sloppy grin
Mom and Dad bought a bird cage just to lock me in
So bullshit doesn't hurt due to the fact it didn't stop me then
I'm lucky I ain't broke a sweat, but how am I supposed to rest
Niggas just don't show respect, dissing me with no regrets
'Til they end up with a broken neck, getting deals with no connects
Bitches blowing me up but never once was it "no" for sex
Ugh it's like a needle stuck in my liver
Trying to get some confidence looking up in the mirror
It's my girlfriends birthday today and I got nothing to give her
That's why her mom's like "See, you shouldn't fuck with the nigga!"
You see Hop is a bunch of bullshit, not the one you should fool with
About to be on my fuel, got a problem well suck a bull's dick
You don't want to suck a bull's dick? You can suck mine
Fuck life, I'm a menace, I'll make a thug cry!

[Chorus: SwizZz & Hopsin]
Ay yo Hop, let me get a beat (fuck you)
You out your mind, you too fucking weak (fuck you)
Come on nigga, I'm a fucking beast (fuck you)
Fuck me?
Fuck me?
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
In the hood, where ever the wind takes us
Unlike you we let the bullshit make us
We just do whatever, we cause chaos
Fuck the rules because I'm a bad mother fucker

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
See I'm a bad mother fucker with a bad mouth
I get drunk, throw up, then pass out
I'll blow on a bitches back then back out
Then back in again and kick her out my damn house
My lack of motivation has me sitting at home
Dropped out of school to rap but I can't make a fucking song
My friends try to give me confidence but fuck the compliments
I'd rather guzzle a bottle and lose consciousness (ahhhh!)
Hey, now ain't that some shit?
Gonna make this mother fucker bounce like a club hit
I can't do one girl, I fuck in clusters
If they don't want it, I give it to them so they suffer(Swizzz!)
Hey, you know the name now, strange child
Gonna blow up any day now
So how you want it? Grab your ankles and bend over
I'm bad to the bone, watch me take over

[Chorus: SwizZz & Hopsin]
Ay yo Hop, let me get a beat (fuck you)
You out your mind, you too fucking weak (fuck you)
Come on nigga, I'm a fucking beast (fuck you)
Fuck me?
Fuck me?
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
In the hood, where ever the wind takes us
Unlike you we let the bullshit make us
We just do whatever, we cause chaos
Fuck the rules because I'm a bad mother fucker

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
I locked seven chicks with some cosmetic tits in the bathroom
I make them suck a prosthetic dick
You can tell through my poetry I'm a hot-headed prick
You think Hip-Hop's dead just because Nas said it, bitch?
Na, I was the missing puzzle piece
Got a deal, made a couple G's
Now all the women falling in love with me
Asking to sit down for a cup of tea
I'm like mother fucker please, bitch, suck on these nuts

[Thomas Token]
Now don't you want to roll with your man?
Sit low in the coupe, blow weed in the wind?
You know he's a sucker, don't leave her with him, na
I got money stacks and this breeze don't end

[SwizZz]
See that nigga balling, that nigga flossing
That nigga hot, he's over all awesome
Truth is, I don't need money to get a chick though
Because if she says "no" I'mma still make her get low

[Chorus: SwizZz & Hopsin]
Ay yo Hop, let me get a beat (fuck you)
You out your mind, you too fucking weak (fuck you)
Come on nigga, I'm a fucking beast (fuck you)
Fuck me?
Fuck me?
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
In the hood, where ever the wind takes us
Unlike you we let the bullshit make us
We just do whatever, we cause chaos
Fuck the rules because I'm a bad mother fucker
