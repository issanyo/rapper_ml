[Verse 1]
Look
Returning to the waters, draw the line, I'm going fishing, ironic
Competition is still in I ain't tripping about where I'm at or another man
Mapping out the future plans
Dedicated to the fans
Stacking up to make the brand
Give it time you'll understand
I'm grateful that I have the chance
To be observant working more consistent to extend a hand
I'm comfortable where I am and where the fuck we're headed
Shout out to all my supports riding without incentives
I'm forever indebted to the faith you have in me
You sip through Jack by the bottle until the glass empty
My past test me but I'm selling in this moment
No mistake you making fame you readjust to keep it rolling
Golden silence got me floating coping with the stress I'm living Phony rappers leaving comments on my page to get attention Hoping they can get a mention
Because they can't get recognition
From the bull shit that they put out
So they get mad and start dissing me?
What the fuck I do? What the fuck I do?
I just swim and avoid the [plastic in] ocean blue
Why throw shade cause you no move?
Rap is passion, not a career for you!

I smell somethin' fishy, fishy
I smell somethin' fishy, fishy
Boy you better stop

[Verse 2]
Don't compare me to these niggas
I'll chew through every last one
Pull Brass Knuckle Benton out the trunk and have some fun
Start spraying up the class and hitting everything that runs
The label split and fell apart but you can still smell the funk
You fucking chumps got loose tongues with nothing to show
The stupid shit you like or post will bring the results that you hope
Or give you the push that you need
Or give the break that you crave
If I see you just remember the times you mentioned my name
Its sympathy for the fake, I sympathize for the clowns
See I converted my pain and slowly developed my sound
Re-calibrated the vision gotta just stop talking and listen
Utilize the time a precision to turn this portion around
Need a week need a crown, now what I'm after is different
The holy water turning brown go wash your hands in the kitchen
The position comes with influence so I weigh my decisions
Responsibility is dying I respect what I'm given
Really something the game is missing
SwizZzle Fish, no Filet
Swim [?] I shimmer all they way to the bank
Like Michael Phelps on a wave
Eat every shark on your tank
[?] todo los every day

I smell somethin' fishy, fishy
I smell somethin' fishy, fishy
Boy you better stop
