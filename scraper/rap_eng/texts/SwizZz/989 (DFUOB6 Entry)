[Verse 1: Grampa Alex]
Guess I'm first up to bat -
'Bout to hit a homerun: Babe Ruth the track
I'm a smooth talker, like a diplomat
I gotta chase this dream 'til it's where I'm at
Kill everything, shoot from the iliac
They'll remember what I write, like the Iliad
Kick back, have a chat with the abstract maniac, 'til he snaps and you get trapped, better get back!

Got a problem with these rappers blowing up
Real recognize real, you ain't showing up
Never been real, you were only showing off
God all on my side, so I'm going off
Murdering the track like a hitman
I'm just trying to do my best to make a hit, man
Everybody go insane when I be chopping, can't believe what they be hearing when I flow it like this, man! Ah!

Hungry for the fame, I could just eat a beat
Cause I'm out of my mind, call me B.o.B
Or maybe Nicki, hah
Watch what you say to me
Cause I don't fool around, I don't fear nobody but G-O-D

See I, Relapse and Recover
Then go Berzerk on another
Yo, but my rhymes ain't Shady
No, I don't be undercover
I say it out in the open
Even if it sounds like I'm braggin'
In this rap Game of Thrones
I'm one of the last of the dragons
Out

[Verse 2: Excursion]
Verse two, you already knew
Excursion, I'm brand new
Hopped up on this verse, like I ran through
Damn, I even gained a couple fans, too
You let a man loose
Who could hand you
A verbal grandstand like I'm Wilkes Booth
You got the chills, boo?
Got the chills, too?
This is what lyrical skills can do

When they appeal to you
And they feel it, too
I'm the biggest catch, are you gonna reel it, too?
My rhymes in the bank, I'ma steal it, too
I'm just trying to make some bank with a deal or two
Let's break it down
Let's get it started
I'll show you how I drain the market
You take a deal, throw it in the garbage
Hold up, flow's about to get retarded

In '96, I was born a psycho
Cause sometimes, I just wanna fight a dike ho
With a rifle strapped to my Mongoose bike, though
I might just explode on this tight flow
I'm white, yo, so it'll be quite a sight, bro
It's nice to know that you can't even write, though
I might go James on a beat, like Franco
Y'all faggots weep, like your name was Frank O

Sometimes, I just wanna choke a rapper
Grab his career and then choke it after
All for a couple of jokes and laughter
I'm just a broke, psychotic bastard
20-14, and it's getting faster
So damn fast, I can barely catch it
Other rappers gonna try and match it
Spit this shit, but I barely practiced

[Outro Verse: Both Rappers]
Back from the dead, where's my Jackson jacket?
You make me laugh, you and your wack clique

On the attack, like I'm back in action
Fuck you up like a fifth of Captain

Can't kick me, I'm like the baddest habit
Go off on the beat, like it's automatic

Killing these rappers, need a mass of caskets
Knock 'em all dead, hats off to Cassius -

Clay. Coming straight out the Bay

So listen close what we 'bout to say

I'm not trying to be overplayed
I just want an outlet to ignore the pain

Hold up, motherfucker, let me turn the page
I spent years, studied up, and I learned the game

You learned the same, but I yearn to say
I was sent to put you other rappers to shame
