[Intro]
Gyeah
Ay turn my headphones down I ain't trying to hear nothing
Check me out

[Verse 1]
I got Pacquiao punch lines
I’m Kobe in the crunch time
At recess I used to squabble in the lunch line
I didn’t know no better, yelling at my P.E. teachers
Touching pretty girls, getting kinky on the P.E. bleachers
Yap, the mind state of a teenager
Now ever since the day that Bri gave birth
She became another dumb statistic
Couldn’t afford the baby and she blamed it on the system
But we don’t care about that, this is rap
My only concern is money and cash, so damn
Let me get my swag on the beat
Like grandpa’s memory I’m bad on the beat
I’ll even ride with the heat
I am down for whatever, I will die for my street
Snap back to reality
Whoops, there goes gravity
Black and white is the nationality
Seems like I’m the “new”-mality
Niggas see the cracker in me, whites detest the black in me
I hope God is looking after me, but every time I call for him it seems like he’s an absentee
Yap, he has a lot of shit to do
I don’t blame him, I dictate my own fate and live it through
Like any smart nigga would do, but look at you fools
Waiting on the lord to deliver your food
You got to go out and get it, now what you waiting for
You’re drinking with a powerhouse, what’s the Taser for
I’ve been extremely patient, fuck it, I can’t wait no more
My threshold’s been reached, I’m knocking niggas like front doors
And what would I front for, I finished power hour now I’m on blunt 4
I can’t see, and I’m starting to wobble
My only medicine is floating in that bottle
The pains alleviated each and every swallow
No homo, I’m talking about Jack D, asshole
I don’t condone kissing males, what the fuck is that
I voted no on prop 8 but I am not a fag
Get real, shit’s ill when I spit it
You did mils, big deal, you’re a fucking gimmick
I would never sell out to try to make a buck
I would rather have my fucking eyelids stapled shut
Are you nuts? Nigga you must be
You don’t have a shotgun, you just like to ride in the front seat
I kick it like I’m relaxing but you don’t hear me though
