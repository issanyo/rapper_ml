[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning got the yearning for peace
No troubles in the beast and no troubles with police
Cause troubles in the streets, they be common like diaper rash
Cause in the present, you still be trying to fight the past
Trouble with your ratchet ass baby momma
All these years and she's still bringing crazy drama
The current man and his crew tried to run up
Now you take your Glock when you go to pick your son up
And there's trouble on the block like it just happened
A lot of trouble but you can't let your stress catch you
Cause now you sick and there's trouble in your hypertension
The doctor said not to worry but he's not convincing
Not to mention
Troubles and a lot of tension
Cause you're girl found out you ain't got a pension
Got fired from your job half a year ago
And she ain't know, now she want to talk, here we go

[Chorus x2]
Away those troubles go down the drain
If you look hard enough then you'll find a [thing?]
It's the same way the sunshine find the rain
You found troubles

[Verse 2]
Troubles with the bank account
Trouble with your finances
And your neighbor's two daughters with their fine asses
Found them big booty pics that you snuck and took
So many troubles, you should write a fucking book
More troubles with that raggedy ass Bonneville
You feeling like Jack and Jill when they was on the hill
You are falling down
Can't stop descending
You ain't fooling us
Nigga stop pretending
Life is all over the place
Like bad tats written all over your face
Wanna escape but these troubles got you sinking fast
At your local bar, not thinking and drinking fast
Doctor said no alcohol with your meds
But you let this shit get you fed
So if your speech starts slurring and you start seeing double
A stroke of luck might get you out of trouble

[Chorus x2]
