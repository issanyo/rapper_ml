"We are the dreamers of dreams"

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Yeah, I wish the president would stop lying
Black babies would stop crying
And young brothers would stop dying
I wish the police would stop killing
Politicians stop stealing and acting like they not dealing
When they know they got bricks in the street
At the country club, fixing to eat
I can see 'em now
I wish we'd get this shit figured out
And stop going the trigger route
And actin' all nigga'd out
On the block with the nine cocked
I wish we try and stop, stop pushing for the pine box
I wish we wasn't so obsessed with death
Tell me is it cause we blessed with less?
I don't know really
I wish the world was safer, I'm scared to travel abroad
That's why I travel with the Lord
I wish a cab would stop for me in the rain
I know you wanna call me insane
I'm a dreamer

[Hook]
"I have a dream that one day (people) injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream..."

"We are the dreamers of dreams"

[Verse 2: Ed O.G]
I wish my pops didn't die when I was seven years old
If there's life after death, is Heaven this cold?
I wish I could wipe the tears of all the crying mothers
Wish New York niggas didn't start flying colors
I wish my people stop avoiding the truth
BET stop poisoning youth
We need changes for teenagers as they go through phases
More than just a concrete jungle, a world of green acres
I wish I'd been more diligent
Smart cats rhyme militant, the rest rhyme ignorant
I wish the world didn't give us funny looks
Think we all just dummies and crooks
Athletes and entertainers singing hooks
We need more black babies that's into books (Read on)
I wish God could take away the pain
I know you want to call me insane
I'm a dreamer

"We are the dreamers of dreams"

[Verse 3: Ed O.G]
I wish I didn't get searched when I come through customs
I wish Christians stop beefing with Muslims
Wish the poor didn't have to take welfare
Wish America had universal healthcare
Cause there ain't no help here, in a country where we don't fight fair
The American dream becomes a nightmare
It's all hype here, and on this track my soul I might bare
I wish Bush just get out of office (Get out!)
Before he start World War Three and try to off us
It won't cost them, but it'll cost us
And right now, believe me, you lost us
