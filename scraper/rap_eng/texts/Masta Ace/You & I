[Intro]
You and I
You- you and I

[Verse 1]
You could say this is a love song
What it means is that I love you
The feelings that I got are so strong
That I place no one above you
I put you high up on a pedestal
Yet there's still dudes still goin’ tryin' to reach
Try and see if they can get at you
But they don't know that you outta reach
Can’t lay a glove, our love is untouchable
Sweet like a rose, these hoes, they can't fuck with you
That's why I stuck with you, that's why you stuck with me
Equally easy to see they can't fuck with me
Not stuck in that sense of the word, 'cause
We ain't givin' up if some tension occurred, but
We stayed down through the thick of it
Love be the medicine if we get sick of it
You

[Chorus]
You and I
You and I
You and- you and I
Ayo, it’s all about
You and I
You and- you and I
Just wanna talk about
You and I (You and me)
You and- you and I
I wrote a song about
You and I (You and me)
You and- you and I
Ayo, it’s all about you

[Verse 2]
Like socks and a sweater, we should stick together
No static, no drama, get our shit together
If we focus on us instead of them and who been shootin' in the gym
We can prolly do this shit forever
It’s hard work, but it's not a chore
Standin' by the door, there be times where we not as sure
But that comes with the territory
We can be alone, but together we a better story
Yeah, like peanut butter jam
Hashtag, black love, see us on the 'Gram
Hashtag, date night, see us on the town
Haters lookin’ up, they wanna see us on the ground, but
We ain't fallin' for the okie-
So we in lockstep, tryna keep it low key
So free, love don't cost a thing
Since I first bought the ring, it's been all about you

[Chorus]
You and I
You and I
You and- you and I
Yup, it's all about
You and I
You and- you and I
Just wanna talk about
You and I (You and me)
You and- you and I
I wrote a song about
You and I (You and me)
You and- you and I

[Verse 3]
You could say this is a love song
What it means is that I love you
The feelings that I got are so strong
That I place no one above you
I put you high up on a pedestal
Yet there's still dudes still goin' tryin' to reach
Try and see if they can get at you
But they don't know that you outta reach
You and who? You and I

[Outro]
You- you- you- you- you- you and-
You- you- you- you- you-
You- y- you- you and-
You and- you and- you- you and I
I
