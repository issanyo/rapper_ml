[Intro]
Hold on
Rise up, raise up, get up, stand up
Wise up, wake up, sit up, man up

[Verse 1]
We raised in the ghetto, we don't stays on the level (Level)
The days when they settled, it was paved by the devil (Devil)
Road to the riches for the slaves on the pedal (Pedal)
Chains to the bars, still we caged by the metal (Uh)
Or should I say steel from the blood on the shield? (C'mon)
Love us on the field and we loved on the real (Yeah)
Love when we thugs and the drugs we conceal (C'mon)
Love when we makin' people laugh, Key and Peele
Remember how it feel when we dressed in our best suits (Uh huh)
Hit the light button and invest in our stress roots (Go)
Life is a test that we keep tryin' to cheat on
Easier to dance through the time, put a beat on
We can get our freak on, but can't get our speak on (Huh)
Eyes closed, can't see the light from the begone
From a sunken place we look up to the sky (What?)
Thinkin' we really ain't gone' get up 'til we die, nah

[Chorus: Masta Ace & Pav Bundy]
Rise up, raise up, get up, stand up
Wise up, wake up, sit up, man up
Right, left, right, left, right, left, march, come on
(Right, left, march, right, left, march)
Right, left, right, left, right, left, start
(Right, left, march, right, left, march, hey)
See, I'm just tryin' to teach about what's goin' on here
Just tryin' to keep our heads above
And maybe you can separate the right from wrong, yeah, maybe
Livin' in a sunken hole, it's right in front of you, Tell me
What you gon' do to make that change, so what are you gonna do?

[Verse 2]
A thousand on the shirt, six hundred on the shoes (Shoes)
Followed in the stores and we wanted on the news (News)
Look at hood and shoes for the face of a criminal
Plants in they views and the hate is subliminal
Fact of the matter is they hate the original
Man, one that cannot make these residuals
These individuals bes in the critical
Gettin' preyed on by the thieves and it's pitiful (Both)
How much does a dollar cost?
Can we count the African slaves in the holocaust?
That's like twenty million strong (True)
Natives to the land, got so many million gone (Gone)
I die hard, I'm Bruce Willis with the move
Look how they wanna try to kill us with the food (Food)
From a sunken place, man, I stand victorious
Right up in your face and it's glorious, let's go

[Chorus: Masta Ace & Pav Bundy]
See, I'm just tryin' to teach about what's goin' on here
Then maybe you can separate the right from wrong, yeah
Livin' in a sunken hole, it's right in front of you, Tell me
What you gon' do to make that change, so what are you gonna do?
Right, left, march now, right, left, march now
Right, left, march now, right, left, march now
See I'm just tryin' to teach about what's goin' on here
We're just tryin' to keep our heads above
And maybe you can separate the right from wrong, yeah, maybe
Rise up, raise up, get up, stand up (Hold on)
Wise up, wake up, sit up, man up (Take me away, come down, come down now)
Rise up, raise up, get up, stand up (Let's just raise up, right)
Wise up, wake up, sit up, man up (No, no way, nowhere to be, nowhere, come down)
Right, left, right, left, right, left, march (Set me free, maybe something)
Right, left, right, left, right, left, start (Maybe somethin' might, might, might, might)

[Outro]
I been holdin' on
Maybe somethin' might
Been holdin' on
Maybe somethin' might just set, set, set, set, set you free
I'm holdin' on
And maybe somethin' might just you free
I'm holdin' on
And maybe something' might just you free
Sunken place, hey
Hey
I'm holdin' on
