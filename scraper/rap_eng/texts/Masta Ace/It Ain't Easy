[Intro: Marlon Saunders]
You know what it is
You know what it is
Chillin' all alone on a friday
Thinkin' 'bout you
And nowhere you can't hide
Girl, I'ma holla at you

[Hook: Marlon Saunders]
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
Easy

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
I fell for you, head over heels
I believed you when you said it was real
If you're a phantasy, I don't think I really care
I see you all the time, but are you really there?
I can't live without you
Hard to imagine what it did without you
I need you in the mornin' or the night time
Matter 'fact, any time is the right time
Nowadays it's easy for me
The internet make you easy to see
You all up in the movies and the magazines
I am so addicted, I am such a fiend

[Bridge: Marlon Saunders]
It feels like my world is upside down
But never I'm lost, I'm found

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wordsworth]
Sittin', lookin' at your picture
Each shout at you just make me sicker
Neighbors upstairs call the cops
Had our relationship on the rock
You unstable to drive my car
Sittin', talkin' 'bout you every bar
The best and the worst times I recall
Really can't talk much, our last call
Me, I'm straight, I don't wanna mix you up
Got a headache the last time I picked you up
Can't bare that my mind is stuck
Maybe I whine too much

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
My sweet addiction
I'm in the street 'til I find yo, my feet are itchin'
Can't stop, until I get you back in my world
Live in a hole, and it's black as a pearl
Need my girl by my side again
Friends tryin' to stop me, I just lie to them
You be the one that I just can't stray from
Keep comin' back to, need to stay away from
Every since day one same old attraction
Same damn picture with the same damn caption
Back on the track and lookin' for some action
I got it bad, still bad - Toni Braxton

[Bridge]
On and on it feels like my world is upside down
But never I'm lost, I'm found

[Hook]
It ain't easy (so hard)
It ain't easy (so hard)
It ain't easy (so hard)
Easy
