[Intro] [Man talking]
I bring back, once again, a very familiar figure to all of you
And accompanied by, other interesting and familiar figures

[Scratching]
"It's Wordsworth, really it ain't hard to explain" - Wordsworth - 'Last Days (So What?)'

[Verse One] [Wordsworth]
I can't tell you something you already know
Words the dopest, it's out in the open, no need to talk very low
My crowd steady grows, each song you hear at home it's like I'm live
Plus I know you like me, can't afford every show
It's bad, a mixtape, a CD label making kit that still has you on consignment
You on the shelf, you already pro
I rhyme with some of these dudes, but I'm more clever so
If I'm not on the bill, when they have shows, I don't ever go
Influential, came here to send you flame
Eccentric, strange, hit with aim that's distant range
Spit till I flood your mental plane
With torrential rain to rinse your brain, your senses drain
The truth statin'
Get called for a beat once the producer makes it
I don't beat block, you got the doe then you can take it
Heat from usin' has you hallucinatin'
Your shows so empty it looks like the room was fumigated

[Scratching]
"Rise is the name, and likewise the motto" - Rise - 'Maintain'

[Verse Two] [Rise]
Sands of the evening leave, follow, you can't flip the bottle
With an hour glass, hours last about as long as Apollo
But how it seems to be a minute
When your chillin' or doin' your duty
Time flies, they call Rise to play in the movies
I rock rap with madness and magic
I pull an ear out your quarter, a top hat out your rabbit
While leaders discuss who owns the oceans and such
And look at each other like, "What? I could blow your ass up."
Now there's conspiracies in power and plenty that knew about it
Pictures of the burning towers, you bent up your twenty dollars
Live, think, try to give more than I make
110%
I sink more shots than I take, who relates?
To all this weird rap that's playin'
Dr. Dolittle knows what those cats be sayin', but I don't
I listen and diss 'em at least they ain't chillin' or wishin'
Thinkin' life is like some sort of picnic or fishin'

[Scratching]
"The Masta Ace"

[Verse Three]
All you greezy ass cats with your cheesy ass raps
Will get your measly ass slapped just as easy as that
I got you on the ground, both knees in your back
Don't try to react it only leads to attack
I will run through you, do you, like I never knew you
These are the +Words I Manifest+ like Guru
And you better listen
Pay attention instead of dissin'
Some of y'all niggas is about to be dead or missin'
When I make moves, vacate the premises
I love competition, can't wait for scrimmages
Who wanna go against me?
You should respect a winner
The Brooklyn representer, New York's the epicenter
I take you on a ride
I know you comin' with me
I got Wordsworth and Rise and they runnin' with me
We'll work it out like a chain gang, we tryin' to gain fame
Same game, we about to do our thang thang
