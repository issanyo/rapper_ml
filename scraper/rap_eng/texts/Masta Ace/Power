[Intro:]
Sa-Roc, Sa-Roc
The astronomical MC..with DJ EFN on the track

[Verse 1: Sa-Roc]
6 Degrees away from the place of your favorite rapper
After goats like trooper Caba
Be storming, then leave cadavers on wax
And asked you who else got next
I'm at the next,  like these vampires in Brooklyn
I don’t thirst for blood but I’ll roast you with my spit
Call that camp fire in the woodlands
I’m half goddess, half with them
I am the finest than all these new rap artists, my children
I don’t need signing I am leaving your path
Finest design, black on black on exterior
Better let there be lining
Bar for bar  better stock a law for Mya
My baba told me to be truthful, that’s why I swear when I’m rhyming
Yall scared to stare at this dark matter, get too close and I’ll burst you down like molecules with collapsed atoms
Who the queen of this rap shit?
Do the math over trap, being still pass heat through those speakers
You all  waiting around for that mass hit, my crash shaping these leaguers
Got me go on my ginetta, all this giving you the best that they got gonna leave me anemic
PD crack on the track, go ring the alarms when I'm heated
Am Eastern star, 120 degrees up under my sleeve
If you breathe, I'm gonna leave you sliced and cut bleeding all on the seaming, partner

[Hook]
Power is definitely in the eyes of the beholder
Cause vanity embraces chaos as the pride becomes bolder
And day by day as usually, as slowly by the hour
The beholder begins to lose his humanity and indefinitely his power, power

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
My flow is incredible, twenty levels ahead of you
Fans will continue to choose me instead of you
That’s what they better do, cause I’m on a pedestal
You Kevin Hart, higher than Mike nigga?
Am 7, 2,  am looking down on you
Cracking up when am clowning you
Cause you think you fly
And that’s the reason am grounding you
I’m gonna clip your wings as soon as I get around of you
In over your head, and that’s the reason am drowning you
You're a small fish in a giant pond, I’m a quiet storm
Sneak in, trying to acquire you like Viacom
Listen big boot to fill nigga, go try it on
It’s a big fighting, and I just might bring the ride on
Tear gas canisters, holding onto the banisters
Your regime falls, that’s where we called for the janitors
To clean up the remains, the body parts and the brains
Ex-pills in the hoopers, diamonds rings in the chains
Let’s go, let’s go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Thirstin Howl III]
Even the warden can’t count my boss
My mom is dead so I invite my aunt
I read the ville like the ville read me
Since my afro too toxic, intense me
Voice activated, auto focus, dirty lens
I run a escort service out of a wide body Benz
I’m a soldier, the coacher, the coacher cold rush
I’m awake when I dream that’s me on the poster
The three train passage where we made magic
Low head to toe, sneakers matching
County of kings, OGs, old school
Let me show you how I do when there is no food
Blade runner, sky divers, gravity, night rider
The energy in me powers the lights in China
For the wonton soup, got some ganja too
Can king bling with the 9, 5 crews
If you showed all my money we could work it out
But don’t ever fucking lie to the Thirstin Howl

[Hook]
