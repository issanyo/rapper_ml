I got it right here
Ya, what you need
Got it right here
I'm that cat, you hear

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
I got a proposition, you should stop and listen
And if you need it kid, I got it like a pot to piss in
I got the right connection, and if I give it to you
You should try to save it like a nice collection
The only problem is, its not collectible
And not sharing it with your friends is unacceptable
This ain't respectable, this kind of line of work
After-hours is my time to work
But understand I ain't trying to hurt hardly nobody really
I got these underage willies acting kinda silly
But whose fault is that, you ever thought of that
Just because I throw it to 'em like a quarterback
Doesn't mean they gotta catch it like Jerry Rice
My shit twice the price but it gets you very nice
It's a scary life, police in my foyer
Now I gotta call my lawyer up, Barry Weiss
They just mad at me, cause I'm making stacks
I be that best seller, I ain't talking paperbacks
And who you know with more strength than this
Every single item on my list is most infamous
I got that Dogg Pound, I got that that Cypress Hill
I got that Flipmode, recognize this type of skill
I go door to door, and if I sell enough smoke
I'mma buy the boat and go shore to shore

[Hook: Masta Ace]
If you want it, you know I got it
Long as you got some money in your pocket
If you need it, I'll supply it
And you won't be disappointed if you try it
If you want it, you know I got it
Long as you got some money in your pocket
And its all for sale
I got it all for sale

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
It's well known, I got slide [?] the family stone
I just thought it was a job, I ain't planned to be known
Every artist need what I got, to each his own
Each his own, more power than Cheech & Chong
So many clients on my list, can't name em all
I got that best good shit, can you blame em ya'll
And what I gave em all, was so incredible
Unforgettable, good shit instead of bull
But if you need a fix, come on and holla at me
This ain't a strip club but you can throw them dollars at me
I got that shit that make ya ease your mind
I got that light, give a nigga sight help him lead the blind
You won't be disappointed, not at all in fact
Most folks who tried me out came calling back
And if you don't believe me ask around
Cause all over the world my shit get passed around

[Hook/Outro]
If you want it, you know I got it
Long as you got some money in your pocket
If you need it, Ill supply it
And you won't be disappointed if you try it
If you want it, you know I got it
Long as you got some money in your pocket
And its all for sale
I got it all for sale
