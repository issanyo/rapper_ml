[Fats - talking]
There he is, there he is
He's on the stoop, he's writing again
I'm gonna' start calling you Stoop Dogg

[Masta Ace - talking]
Yeah, whatever, what's up Fats, man?

[Fats - talking]
Nothing man, I always see you on this stoop
With the pen, the paper, you're writin'
But no, it's a beautiful day outside ya'know
Don't you wanna' get out, hit the streets
Check some bitches, c'mon bro

[Masta Ace - talking]
Nah, I'm good man, I'm chilling man, I'm aight

[Fats - talking]
(Laugh)
Yo, that your car?
What happened to your windshield?

[Masta Ace - talking]
I don't really wanna' talk about that man

[Fats - talking]
(Laugh)
You need to leave Reese's crazy ass alone
She's a fuckin' psycho
But, on a serious tip I need you to come to the crib later
'Cause I wanna' talk to you about something
I got a little idea that I'm gonna' wanna' run by you

[Masta Ace - talking]
Uh-oh, here we go

[Fats - talking]
Nah nah seriously
What are you writing anyway?

[Masta Ace - talking]
Yeah I'm working on this song or whatever
You know, about the beautiful things I see

[Fats - talking]
There ain't shit to see that's beautiful sitting over here
I'll tell you that

[Masta Ace - talking]
Yeah there is, yo
You've just gotta' look closer
