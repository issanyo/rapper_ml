[Intro: Strickie Love]
I like you like how I put it down
You like I like how you put it down, yeah

[Verse 1]
[Wordsworth]
You know I like when you come to my shows
Mean mothers, little groupies, and you checkin' these hoes
Get all jealous wit' a nigga, get yours
And hold me down like a wife is supposed, that's how it goes

[Maste Ace]
You know I like it when you wear them white stretch pants
And do that little pigeon toe fresh stance
If you try to start a family it's the best chance
When you back it up, homie like "let's dance"

[Stricklin]
You know I like it when you make noise
When your private parts get moist, touch yourself with toys
Before I go you come and I get joy
When you call your girlfriends, then they come join

[Wordsworth]
You know I like it when you wear that dress
That little black when it's real tight, I swear it's the best
Take it off, then we fuck 'til your hair is a mess
Oh my god you treated player the best, yes yes

[Masta Ace]
You know I like when you lick your lips like that
If you want you can attack, I won't fight back
This is us, it's a plus and I must be be
Blinded by the lust and I never want my sight back

[Stricklin]
You know I like it when our lips lock
Friday you sit on top, inside, hit the spot
Both hands, when you rip my cock, lick the top
Tape it then later on we get to watch

[Hook: Strickie Love]
I like you like, you like (you like) how i put it down
You like I like, you like how you put it down, yeah
I like you like, you like (you like) how i put it down
You like I like, I like, oh I like how you put it down, yeah

[Verse 2]
[Masta Ace]
I know you like it when this good brother runs home
Runs home and gets all up in your fun zone
The way I meant it, you was deep like an interview
And when I spin it through, you're sexually unknown

[Stricklin]
I know you like it when I pull your hair
Grab your weaves and pull you near, grab your ass, pull your rear
Take off your [?], then I put it there
And the other in your mouth like it's full of air

[Wordsworth]
I know you like when i spend that guap
Get your hair, Dear, yup, keep you windowshopped
Get your persons and bags, your friends can't cop'
Summertime, keep that window dropped, it don't stop

[Masta Ace]
Yeah, I know you like it when I cook a nice meal for you
Kiss your ear, let you hear how I feel for you
And I'll sure break the law, I steal for you
And if it come down to it, I will kill for you

[Stricklin]
I know you like it when I go down
Move fast and slow down, go deep, go around
Pull your skirt up, panties down
The kids sleep and we sneak to have sex, making no sound

[Wordsworth]
I know you like when I hit that spot, yeah
You know the one that make you get real hot, yeah
I had you screamin' like you just got shot
Herb so good, when I lick that - what? what?

[Hook: Strickie Love]
I like you like, you like (you like) how i put it down
You like I like, you like how you put it down, yeah
I like you like, you like (you like) how i put it down
You like I like, I like, oh I like how you put it down, yeah
