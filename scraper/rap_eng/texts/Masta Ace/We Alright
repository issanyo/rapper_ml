[Verse One] [Stricklin]
What it feel like?
When the money is low and you worry cause your bill starts stacking up
What it feel like?
When you gotta raise a kid by yourself cause your baby daddy acting up
What it feel like?
When it's final exams and you cram cause you ain't prepared like you should
What it feel like?
Then you walk across the stage cause you graduated and you know it's all good
What it feel like?
When you mad at your boss cause all day at work he getting on your last nerve
What it feel like?
Then you finally get promoted with a raise and you get the money you deserve
What it feel like?
When you up at the plate, full count, 9th innin' and you down a run
What it feel like?
Then you knock it out the park, grand slam, home run, now your team won!

[Hook]
Life get's hard sometimes but you know it's gonna be all right
Not gonna run and we not givin' up, no, we gon' fight
If anybody ask how we are let them know that we all right
But when the time comes you gonna shine so bright
Let them see your light

[Verse Two] [Wordsworth]
What it feel like?
When your mom don't believe and you vexed
And you always feel left out
What it feel like?
Went to school, came home, no job
Now you sittin' there stressed out
What it feel like?
Receive the rewards and respect that all your hard work earned
What it feel like?
Sad but you smiled cause you just heard your baby say his first words
What it feel like?
Three seconds on the clock when you made the final shot and you won the game
What it feel like?
Stuck, head down, gave up and your luck had began to change
What it feel like?
When a son and his dads locked up and the mother cries all night
What it feel like?
When they both come home, not alone no more so it's all right

[Hook]
Life get's hard sometimes but you know it's gonna be all right
Not gonna run and we not givin' up, no, we gon' fight
If anybody ask how we are let them know that we all right
But when the time comes you gonna shine so bright
Let them see your light

[Verse 3] [Masta Ace]
What it feel like?
When you work real hard to the point that you feel kinda' burnt out
What it feel like?
When after everything you've done, it still doesn't really work out
What it feel like?
When your family is mad at you because you made another bad choice
What it feel like?
When you tryna' be heard but word, it seems like you got no voice
What it feel like?
When you wake up, knowing today is gonna be an incredible day!
What it feel like?
When you know in your heart no matter what, it's gonna be okay
What it feel like?
When the coach say "Get in the game!" and you finally do get a chance
What it feel like?
When you finally get the ball and you score and you get to do that dance

[Hook]
Life get's hard sometimes but you know it's gonna be all right
Not gonna run and we not givin' up, no, we gon' fight
If anybody ask how we are let them know that we all right
But when the time comes you gonna shine so bright
Let them see your light
