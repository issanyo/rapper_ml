Check it out, ya'll
(Check it out, ya'll)
Check it out, ya'll
(Check it out, ya'll)
Check it out, ya'll
(Check it out, Ya'll)
Check it out, ya'll
(Check it out, ya'll)

I.N.C

[Chorus 1]
To all my niggies over there
What's goin' on?
To all my peoples over here
What's goin' on?
To all the cuties with the stack
What's goin on?
To all the killas in the back
What's goin' on?

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothing but a thing now
Who wants to swing with the I.N.C
Bring bikinis with the string
And let's get on down
I like the sound that makes my mind run away
Put that fucking gun away
'Cause everything is peace tonight
Aight
It ain't gonna' be no fight, we gonna' do it up, right
Feelin' alright, gotta' get right
The party all night
I step in with my Adidas as dumb fly
And that oldschool like Cooley High
Why would you wanna' flex
When cheques get cashed
And wack rappers get bashed
But not getting bismarked on the mic
You'll never know when the I.N.C.'s gonna' strike
'Cause it happens so fast
Now let the hit last

[Chorus 2]
To all my niggies over there
What's goin' on?
(Ya' rollin' with the I.N.C.)
To all my peoples over there
What's goin' on?
(They're rollin' with the I.N.C.)
To all the cuties with the stack
What's goin on?
(They're rollin' with the I.N.C.)
To all the killas in the back
What's goin' on?
(They're rollin' with the I.N.C.)

[Verse 2]
Riding, I'm going riding
I've got my G by my side
And we're crusing the ville like tour guides
Pride in my brain for living through the hectic
Streets of ville-ville
Where dreams get ejected
Damn
It seems like just yesterday
We played two hand touch around the way (Okay)
And as I cruise through the blocks
I look at all the flocks
Of bums with no socks
Living life on the rocks
And I'm thinking just how lucky I am
It didn't get me
Here comes fifty, he wanna' sweat me
You're not arresting me
Arresting me
Don't go testing me
'Cause my destiny
Doesn't involve handcuffs or bars
Just wanna' boom through the bass and the cars
'Cause physically, mentally and emotionally
This is how it's supposed to be

[Chorus 2]
To all my niggies over there
What's goin' on?
(Ya' rollin' with the I.N.C.)
To all my peoples over there
What's goin' on?
(They're rollin' with the I.N.C.)
To all the cuties with the stack
What's goin on?
(They're rollin' with the I.N.C.)
To all the killas in the back
What's goin' on?
(They're rollin' with the I.N.C.)

[Refrain]
I.N.C
I.N.C
It's like this, ya'll
(It's like that, ya'll)
It's like this, ya'll
(It's like that, ya'll)

[Verse 3]
I'm living fat, ya'll
With mad skill for the grill
If you're mad like lion still don't shoot to kill
Black cooped the bill, sittin' on chrome
No place like home where ill kids roam
(Yo, who ya' down with)
Yo, I'm down with the I
I'm down with the I.N.C
(What, and who you rollin' with?)
Yo, I'm rollin' with the I
I'm rollin' with the I.N.C
(What)
Don't even try and see
None of this here
What's up dear, you got a lot in the rear
And I'd swear that what you really wanna' do
Is get down and party all night with the crew
It's just me, Lord Digga and the rest of the clan
What's up, the Steady Pace
That's my man
And I stand in the middle of the jam
With both hands high in the air
Aww yeah

I.N.C

[Chorus 2]
To all my niggies over there
What's goin' on?
(Ya' rollin' with the I.N.C.)
To all my peoples over there
What's goin' on?
(They're rollin' with the I.N.C.)
To all the cuties with the stack
What's goin on?
(They're rollin' with the I.N.C.)
To all the killas in the back
What's goin' on?
(They're rollin' with the I.N.C.)

I.N.C
I.N.C
