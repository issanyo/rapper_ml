[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
I boom and I bash and I bash and I boom
I come forty deep when I enter the room
We're the poom-poom, Digga wanna zoom zoom
Watch how we creep and sweep like a broom
Cuz this is the sound of the mighty I.N.C
Makin' history, niggies wanna be like we
I roll with L.D., and Paula with the P
Can't forget Leschea, deuce to the tre
23 years old, sista with the soul
Everybody's born to roll and gettin' swoll
I'm gunna break it down for my niggies over there
So peep the process and not the one in your hair
You know it ain't over till it's over
You know it ain't over till it's over
You know it ain't over till it's over
So bust this

[Verse 2: Lord Digga]
Mics get damaged Like jean suits when i get loose
And jack roots for samples that make me wanna trample
Maim, mutilate, dismember, dismantle
Whats my handle, Digga from the bush
And please dont push, im on the egde
Look
At what took
Many years for hell to cook
Im comin for you, so you better read ya good book
From front to back cause when i attack
You be lying on the ground with ya fuckin head cracked
Ya shoulda stopped rollin dice
Brothas know im nice, i been that way for life
Catch wreck at the show and then on yo wife
So niggas look out here we come
Its the INC y'all dont really want none

[Hook: Masta Ace]X2
My tank's on full and I'm headed Eastbound (get down get down)
I got the bump in my trunk and my sound's underground (get down get down)

[Bridge: Lord Digga]
Break it down baby brotha
Break it down baby brotha
Break it down baby brotha
Break it down

You gotta look on your face like you wanna take mine
Whatever you feel, whenever you feel, fine
Everybody's mentality around me, is the
Epitome of wanna be G, but wake up, get up
Clear the funk from your eyes, recognize
The I.N.C.'s on the rise
B-Bass bombin' all the way to Savannah
Straight from Medina, not White like Vanna
Black and as a matter of fact, yo bust that
Um, Digga with the um bigga boom than ya gat
Fat with the mad snap hat to get ill
Can ya feel the skill
From the woofer grill of your Coupe DeVille
I know ya can and if ya can then cool
Ain't nothin' like a B-Bass fool
It's the I. to the N. to the C
Ya can't fuck with me
It's the I. to the N. to the C
Ya can't fuck with me

[Hook: Masta Ace]X2
My tank's on full and I'm headed Eastbound (get down get down)
I got the bump in my trunk and my sound's underground (get down get down)

[Bridge 2: Leschea]
Who is the crew comin thru with the A-C-E The I-N-C
Who is the crew comin thru with the rough stylin The I-N-C
Who is the crew with the Brooklyn mentality The I-N-C
Who is the crew to break it down with the 1-2-3 The I-N-C
Break it down x 7

It's individual, residual, kid ya will
Get dissed if you step to this so don't miss
When ya aim, so maintain and feel no pain
Tell me can ya stand the rain on your brain, chain
Reaction, I see the niggies
And the hotties with their bodies complete with satisfaction
So when you see the Ace comin' through with the crew
This is how we do
