[Intro: Lord Digga]
Hit me over the head, nigga!
Yeah, you're god damn right
We got the shit to make your dome split
You fucking around over here?
You gonna feel the terror

[Verse 1: Masta Ace, Lord Digga]
(What's your name, kid?)
Well, lets just say
It's the A to the S - E
Don't try to test me
And I just be
Brownsville to the bone like that
Stone avenue, where ya at?
[Who you run with?]
Well, the INC
I got lord to the D
I got Paula to the P
Plus me, ey, Leschea
Keep the tangarae
And pour me a glass of that monkey made of brass
Fast
That's how it is and how it goes
I don't need silk clothes
To pull all the holes
In your head
Bum the gunshots and the raps
I bust mad caps
When the wack take naps
Perhaps
I need to wake 'em up
Then I take 'em up
Then I shake 'em up
Hey, then I break 'em up
Like glass
Im up in that ass like Charmin
Harmin'
MC's that feel like swarmin
Like fleas
But I got these
Pesticide rhymes
You best to try crimes
Cuz' if you try to fuck with this
Then you just made an error
And you gonna feel the terror

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Coming through in the black cherry automobile
That's how I feel
Everybody claimin' real and holdin steel
But I be on some rollin shit, Holdin' shit
Down for my borough, Brooklyn base thorough
That's why, I do or die
Like Bed-Stuy
Oh my, that shit that get you high
It's something of a phenomenon
Like white lines
Me and Mines run thick like Heinz
Catch up, you can't catch up
So play the rear, over there
It's B-bass in your ear
And your eyes
So realize and recognize
A nigga dies
When we terrorize

[Verse 3: Masta Ace, Leschea]
I don't think you really wanna play
Cuz' we be doin' niggas every day
Just like that
J-J-Just like that
J-J-Just like that
I cram a knife in your back
The INC don't care about you and your crew
Or them niggas that you run with
Them the niggas you'll get done with
Check it
We be comin' with that bigger and better and more shit
We got that raw shit
It's the I
It's the N
It's the C
No mystery, You dont want none of me
You must not know the time
If you wanna try and say that
Whatchu' got there, INC?
Motherfucking right, yo play that, hate that
(Feels so good, that my mind won't let go)
Black boy, black boy
Turn that shit down
Fuck that
Now feel the terror in my sound
