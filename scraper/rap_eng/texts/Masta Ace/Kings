[Intro]
(Kings)
Oh
Marco
It's crazy
Where them crowns at?
(Kings)

[Verse 1]
I'm from the V-I-Double-L-E, like M.O.P
Where cats walk around like, "Him or me?"
Art of survival, tryin' to calculate the heart of a rival
Understand like part of the bible, this a revelation
They say niggas never learn, this an education
Since Malcolm and Martin we've been marchin' for a better nation
Is this a big meltin' pot, or is it seperation?
I'm breakin' bread with the tribes, no reservations
Yo, we gotta make it as a federation
Are we livin' together, or is it segregation?
Jim Crow laws hem no flaws
I'm tryin' to run it up like ten more scores
The chain of command, analyze the brain of a man
That understands the shame and the pain of a fan
They can't comprehend all these songs he's hearin' now
And can't understand what these dudes is wearin' now
But think back when we was young, 'bout the same age
Our parents, they looked at us in them same ways
We was playin' DMC and Fat Boys (Fat)
And they was sayin' to us, "Turn off that noise"
Told us, we gotta listen to some real music
Earth, Wind and Fire, somethin' you can feel music
From where I stand, it's like the view is panoramic
When my retirement is announced, the fans'll panic
'Cause that's one less soldier in the greatest fight
The love is heavy in my heart and the hate is light
Then every other summer an up-and-comer
Thinks he can jump right in my shoes if he plays his right (Kings)
But these are Mutumbo-size in my humble eyes
And this is no small feat for these mumble guys
Man, you know the drill like a cavity
Comprehend the gravity of my savagery
I'm so underrated, it's a travisty
Where's the praise and the raise in my salary?
Got a wife held up by life to marry me
We dress to impress and get fresh like Barry B
Yo, you would think we on a date night
It's hard to get in, you won't believe what the wait's like
We tryin' to see what it taste like
But it's hard to fit in, you won't believe what the hate's like
The game of life's full of crazy things
It's so intense, makes no sense like baby rings
Until the overweight lady sings
We'll leave you this body of work 'til they say we kings (Kings)
Yeah, 'til they say we kings

[Outro]
I grew up to be a king for the city I rep
I grew up to be a king for the city I rep
I grew up to be a king
I grew up to be a king
I grew up to be a king
I grew up to be a king for the city I rep
I grew up to be a king for the city I rep
(Kings)
