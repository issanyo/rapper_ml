[Skit: Marco & Lou]
Marco
I got some good news
And I got some bad news
Oh man, what's up?
I swear to God I didn't smoke in the house again
Nah, it's not that
I'll give it to you straight, man
It's been six months
My mom says it's time for you to go
I'm sorry bro
(Sighs) I mean, I knew it was comin
So I assume that's the bad news
What's the good news?
I found a spot for you to crash
A friend up for a Green
He's lookin' for a roommate
It's gonna be perfect for you I think
Stop lookin' so worried man, it's gonna be cool
Come on, I'm gonna help you pack
