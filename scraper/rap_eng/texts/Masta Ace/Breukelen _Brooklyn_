[Chorus: Smif-N-Wessun]
The sound of Brooklyn
We gets down in Brooklyn
We move around in Brooklyn
The town is Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Bed-Stuy, Flatbush, Brownsville, Crown Heights
Where the music feels good and it sounds right (yeah)
Summertime, music in the park
We can do this in the dark, we don't even need no streetlights
We bright, look how we all shine (Look)
We all tryna live so we all grind (Grind)
And then we started saying, "Crooklyn"
Had everybody thinking it was all crime (Stick 'em up)
Shout it out to Spike Lee
And the dude on the corner in the white tee
And the girl off the block with the attitude
Had to write a song, show my gratitude (Welcome)
Welcome to my city, man
To the streets where the late, great Biggie ran
And damn near everyone's a Biggie fan
That's 'cause we support our own

[Chorus: Smif-N-Wessun]
The sound of Brooklyn
We gets down in Brooklyn
We move around in Brooklyn
(B-R-double-O-K-L-Y-N, B-R-double-O-K-L-Y-N)
The town is Brooklyn
(B-R-double-O-K-L-Y-N, B-R-double-O-K)

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Big Daddy Kane is synonymous, Jay-Z's synonymous
Sean P's synonymous, I'm just tryna honor this
Place that we call home, Brook-Nam, look I'm
Really just tryna make you proud like, "Look, mom"
I'm tryna make you smile like, "Look, dad
Got the Nets on the fitted and the bookbag" (Nice)
And you know the Timbs clean
On these bars, we go in like a swim team (Say what?)
Brooklyn be the pedigree
If you find something wild, man, set it free (Set it free)
Set it free and watch it go
Then give it to the world and watch it grow ('Cause you know)
'Cause you know we everywhere
Disrespect my home, you will never dare (Never)
'Cause you get mushed quick
Coney Island, Red Hook, Fort Greene, Bushwick

[Chorus: Smif-N-Wessun]
The sound of Brooklyn
We gets down in Brooklyn
We move around in Brooklyn
(B-R-double-O-K-L-Y-N, B-R-double-O-K-L-Y-N)
The town is Brooklyn
(B-R-double-O-K-L-Y-N, B-R-double-O-K)

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
Marco, you made it here, Gang Starr, y'all made it here
Even though y'all wasn't born here, still y'all made it here
And now it's like you one of us
And we all tied together like some braided hair (Yeah)
Dumbo to Clinton Hills
Gentrified and the tension builds (Build)
But we find a way to live together
Wish we could find a way to live forever (Forever)
Either way, the music will (Tell me)
What I gotta do to prove it's real? (Tell me)
What I gotta do to make it clear?
You can make it anywhere if you can make it here
Lil' Kim's synonymous
Foxy, Fabolous, Maino's synonymous (Say what?)
In a world full of promises
Smif-N-Wessun, Bucktown, what I'm tryna honor is Brooklyn

[Chorus: Smif-N-Wessun]
The sound of Brooklyn
We gets down in Brooklyn
We move around in Brooklyn
(B-R-double-O-K-L-Y-N, B-R-double-O-K-L-Y-N)
The town is Brooklyn
(B-R-double-O-K-L-Y-N, B-R-double-O-K)
