Intro:
Mic Check.....
[Verse One: Milani The Artist]
Aiyo ya'll came up in the spot cu you heard that it was hot
Even though a week ago, somebody was shot
They said the cops came and swarmed the whole block
And shut the club down but nope they did not
Cu the spots so packed, you can barely even walk
The music's so loud its impossible to talk
Ya'll just point where you wanna go
