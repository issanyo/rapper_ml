[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Let's take a walk through the deepest part of the hood
I wanna know who it was that said it was all good
He must've never been to the corner
And spent the half an hour or longer
Where you could smell reality stronger
Where they sell you grease in a box and hope that you die quicker
And if you're old enough to walk to the store you can buy liquor
Where you can find a dice game at any time of the night
And somebody gets shot or stabbed every time there's a fight
Where cats die in the blue sky and the sunlight
And ya bound to get clowned for not holdin ya gun right
By little kids with great game cause they learned to take aim
At a young age, and elude police, with a fake name
He's tellin 'em "I'm Bobby Jackson from 3-B"
When the fact is he's really Rashawn from 4-D
Hey this is going out to your hood straight from mine
Aiyyo, let's take a walk in blue skies and sunshine, come on

Blue skies, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in the...
Blue skies, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in the...
Blue skies, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in the...
Blue skies, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in the...

[Verse 2: Apocalypse]
Over here it's either rap, hustle crack or play ball
And gats niggas carry ain't small
The cats that used to be kids when you ran the halls, is the drug lords
His broad's the same chick that liked you from the 4th floor
Her older brother he the neighborhood bully
You and him cool but he keep playin ya boy cause he pussy
Where the old ladies be up in ya B.I
Callin nine-eleven every time you in the yard tryin to be high
Dice games can turn into a shootout quick
If you sayin he aced then he sayin he sixed
People waitin for the mail to get they check
In blue skies and sunshine you gotta give respect to get respect
You know

Blue skies (uh-huh), sunshine (sunshine)
What a day to take a walk in the... (let's take a walk)
Blue skies (uh-huh), sunshine (sunshine)
What a day to take a walk in the... (let's take a walk)
Blue skies (uh-huh), sunshine (sunshine)
What a day to take a walk in the... (let's take a walk)
Blue skies (uh-huh), sunshine (sunshine)
What a day to take a walk in the... (let's take a walk)

[Chorus]
Compton come on
Long Beach come on
5th Ward come on
Everybody come on
Brick City come on
Cabrini Green come on
West Philly come on
Everybody come on

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
And oh yeah, if you see a girl on the block, be sure 'fore you rush over
Cause 14 year old girls be dressed like they much older
See that young chick walkin the block tryin to get paid
Is in the same class as ya sister and still in the 10th grade
And ya might see your neighbor, down at the corner bodega
Buyin a malt liquor in exchange for a used Sega
You can even buy your clothes on the block, imagine that
From Versace to a Coogi sweater wit' a matchin hat
See this cat's got a big bag of stuff that he just stole
It's the same old routine, but it never gets old
And ya might catch a cab if you live on the right block
From Black Pearl to White Top yo they might stop
They got a bulletproof partition, cause niggas draw heat
But the driver, got a bigger one, up under the seat
See cats don't really wanna kill, they tryin to eat
Yo ain't it a nice day to take a walk in the street
Let's go

Blue skies, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in the...
Blue skies, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in the...
Blue skies, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in the...
Blue skies, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in the...

Drunk drivers come on
Bus drivers come on
Cab drivers come on
