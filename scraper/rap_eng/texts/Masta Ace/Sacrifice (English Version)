"Raw Poetics"

[Verse 1: Rock Bottom]
Put the ice back in the glass, chill where it belongs
Give a fuck if you rock it on your body, leave it out your songs
Critical of the surface cause that's what people perceive is the purpose
Behind the music, makin' our efforts worthless
Media paints it a circus and how we follow the role
And that's the reason that it's outta control
The radio an alias to the demeaning of gold
Cause all the glitter and the shinin' is all that matters with soul
I pocket a profit is slim to none on our best day
Like Ev say, they only play the West on Wednesday
It's futile to try to get a spin on the mainstream
I thought about it once but then I snapped out a daydream
Back to reality, grindin' to get respected
The goal is to wreck it so nothing less is expected
Check the madness with method
It's like a lavish impression
Is distilled upon those who ain't even worth the mention

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Yo Peter Piper picked 'em
Peckled pickled peppers
Hip hop has expanded from Mecca to all these little sectors
I'm talkin' Texas and Tennessee also Mississippi
How they fit in the picture?
Well listen, this is tricky
This ain't no hateration
I can't forget Virginia and Georgia cause they made hip hop a greater nation
And no I ain't pokin' fun
Respect to Nas, Hip Hop Is Dead and New York is holdin' the smokin' gun
We used to lead the way in
Now we follow behind
We makin' down south songs like we outta our mind
What happened to innovation?
I gotta ask every New York rapper in this generation
Can we get it back?
It's hard to say when I watch Smack DVD and damn near every kid is wack
We need some brand new laws, a rap constitution
You ain't gon' change the game, try to make a contribution

[Verse 3: Rock Bottom]
See my solution's euthanasia, a new beginning
Examine the rap game and felt ashamed to tell my peeps I'm in it
I sigh from deep within it, falsify the awesome winnings
Rhymin' 'bout the floss they spendin'
Gun in hand, plan to end it
(Life)
What it take you write your tightest 16?
Each track is fight or flight syndrome and y'all is splittin' seams
Runnin' away and steady duckin', evadin' the thought
Of puttin' effort into your art
See that'll take patience
And rappers ain't to blame solely
The game from where they standin' is to make money
Supply the garbage that these fans demandin'
That's why I separate myself from monetary needs
Won't sacrifice the slightest part of me to sell a CD
(Shit)
Could give a fuck how you perceive these hits
I'll turn a deaf ear, but we read lips
And all that criticism?
Is wasted effort in sweatin'
You should've implied to improve it
Move out the way or join the lines of the movement

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
It's been proven it don't take much to rise to the top
To get your cream all you gotta do is sign on the dot
If you're firing Glocks, get shot or supplyin' some rocks
Makes a better resume when you're in line for the boss
The line is defrost
Fuck all the shine and the floss
This is hip hop bitch
And yo we rhymin' the ?
Your timin' is off
Should've took the Rhine off your watch
And stopped a line drive rival of thought
Of keepin' it raw
Instead of these people leadin' the fall
Of somethin' that had potential of freein' us all
And it don't really matter where you at on the map
You've been splattered with crap
It's time to stop flattering the wack
I ain't a hater I just keep my standards at eye level
Why settle?
Y'all can burn slow like iron kettles
I peddle these raps, incredible
A head full but we're ahead of schedule
Except we're with better flows

[Verse 5: Balti]
Yo, yo, yo
One for the treble, two for the bass
Dragon Balti sur un son mad de Masta Ace
Visite mon Myspace حتی تعرفنی شکون
Mr. Baltiroshima sur Myspace point com
Wesh ma gueule je suis là
جيت لهنا pas à pas
كبرت مع الوقت لوليت بلطيروشيما
Chuis l'arabe ouais صاحبي
Je rappe en arabe
Sur un son oldschool تاع les anciens soldats
إذا شفت كيفاش كبرت و تربيت à Tunis
MCs real قريت و تعلمت نولي
عمري seize ans j'ai déjà quitté	l'école
Un petit racailleux qui pose des rimes hardcores
Sur des sons تاع des fous sons qui fait bang bang
ما ن écoute ش على موسيقى slow [?]
Hip-hop de dance صنعت مني l'original
ولد البلاد حمد للّه
Toujours fort toujours al
C'est à mon tour de prier comme les oldschool
[?] Big Daddy Kane, Masta Ace et Cool
Wesh ma crew si explosive [?] interdit [?]
Dédicace لخواة العرب [?]
Hip-hop for life هذا شو تعلمت نقول
اعطيني son اعطيني ل vodka صاحبي ما نبقاش يمشي [?]
Un son lourd un	son de ouf في ل mix
C'est du صحيح avec mes Raw Poetics
