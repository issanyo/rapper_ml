[Intro]
Uh huh. Lets go Ace

[Verse One] [Masta Ace]
Ayo it's that exclusive song shit
That climb the charts, bang our chest, King Kong shit
Y'all ain't got no bomb shit
It's that, BK, Shaolin, Queens and Bronx shit (What about Milwaukee?)
And Manhattan shit (Oh)
We so passionate
This is in high demand we had to ration it
So come get ya daily dose
Cause that shit them niggas put out is barely close
It's the eMC and Leo's
And y'all gon' smell defeat like cheese Doritos
Call all your parole boards and P.O's
Cause DJ's bound to cut this up like kilos
And distribute it, y'all can't get rid of it
This ain't no mistake this shit's deliberate
And if y'all want that raw
Rap shit brought to your door
We the four that sure deliver it

[Stricklin]
Yes sir guess who back in the spot
Got them hands up, I ain't even packin' a Glock
I'm just a hustler, I don't need to pack in my sock
Just give me Pro Tools, a Mbox, and a track if its hot
And this shit, make you wanna smack yo momma
I'm a star risin' like Barack Obama, the track so drama
I gets it poppin' in the hood like the 4th of July
Let it be understood, I'm not the nigga to try
Y'all ain't stoppin' our fame
Cause us not sellin' is like The Game not droppin a name
It's gon happen regardless, we the hardest
It's eMC, ya favorite artist's favorite artist

[Hook]
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
"Guess what we's about to do" - Queen Latifah
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
"Tell 'em what it's about, no doubt, leak it out"

[Wordsworth]
Excuse me, I'm standin' in your way? (Uh huh)
Blockin' all the glamor, not an amateur
Don't gamble with a play
On the planet for the day, first we landin' in L.A
Tour the planet, hit the Bay, then Atlanta in GA
You don't plan on shootin' nothin', so that hammer put away
That talk is outlandish, that you brandishin' is fray
The only cannon/Cannon that you shot was your camera
At a photo shoot we stay fresh like a mannequin display
With the grammar that I say I'm like an animal that's stray
Cause manners went away, people panic ran away
You ain't never drive a phantom any day
You couldn't buy tickets to the Opera with The Phantom in the play
It's like a brush fire, the flames that I spit
Cause it only spreads wider when you fannin' them away
And that mic in your palm, is like a baton
When you see me on the track then you handin' it away

[Punchline]
Yo, simple and plain
If they don't let me up in this game
I'm gonna rob the first idiot that's makin' it rain
No need to be poppin' them thangs
We can Scrap
Like that dude that was dancin' with Kane
It's embedded in my D.N.A. strain
Best cat in the game
Up-bringin' made my thoughts insane
Real rhymers, you dealin' with rap's finest
We make the crowd say "ho" like Don Imus
With one liners
If you willing to fight with this mic
Air you out like some white on whites
In town for one night, and we bringin' em out
Got no time for games, came to spit and be out

[Hook]
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
"Guess what we's about to do" - Queen Latifah
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
Check, checkin' it out
Ya don't stop, eMC
You waited long enough, we must
Leak it out
"Tell 'em what it's about, no doubt, leak it out"
