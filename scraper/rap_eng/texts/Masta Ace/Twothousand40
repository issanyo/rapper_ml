[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Yo it's a nice summer day man the weather warm
I don't need my skully hat or my leather on
I will not need my long john pants
And there's not even a chance I'mma have to put a sweater on
I hit the block and I take a deep inhale
The warm breeze catch my shirt like a wind sail
I make a left down Hinsdale
Then I see my nigga Rob, man I thought that he was in jail
He in the front yard puffin' on the blunt hard
I stop a while and talk trash like a junk yard
Then keep it moving like the wings on a hummingbird
The whole day's ahead of me, I ain't trynna come in third
I hit the subway waiting on the platform
I see this old man in Sean John and Phat Farm
He asks me if I like rap and I say, "Yeah"
He takes the Yankee fitted hat off his grey hair
Then he starts to spit the best verse I ever heard
I'm amazed and I'm hangin' on his every word
He goin' in though the train noise loud around
People on they way to work start to crowd around
We can't believe how this old man spittin' fire
He was a hundred bars in and he didn't tire
He kept going and he wasn't backin' away
I heard somebody say they reckognized him from back in the day
Word?

[Hook: Samples from various artists]
That cat was nice with his
Bless with the lyrics
Rap fantastic, Street corner soldier
Showing and proving on a day to day basis
Doin’ his thing from the OG’s on down to the youngs
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
When he finished up his verse, everybody clapped
Except a couple kids, that's cause they probably rapped
Against him, these kids wouldn't have lasted a round
He held his Yankee hat out and he passed it around
I dropped a dollar in then I dropped a dollar more
I said, "Yo old man your rap skills are kind of raw"
He said I graduated high school in '84
And had a hundred verses back then, maybe more
He said it'd been about thirty years plus
Since he was on a bus goin' around doin' a crazy tour
And then he reached into his grey velour
And pulled out a CD that he had dropped way before
I was born, he was on somebody steps sittin'
Holdin' a pen and pad, looing like he'd just written
A song, I said "You looked way younger then"
He said "Yeah, that was a long hot summer then"
