Are you ready?

[Masta Ace - talking]
Hell yeah I'm ready, my bags is packed
Let's get out of here

[Guard - talking]
Jesus, what's with the clothes?

[Masta Ace - talking]
Man, fuck you, you don't know nothing about this
'95, '96, this was the shit, you crazy?

[Guard - talking]
Well, my boy in case nobody told you, it's 2001
Here, give my brother another call when you get home
He owns a bunch of stores in the five boroughs
They sell all that fubar Sean Jean, Prat farm
You know, all that stuff you people wear

[Masta Ace - talking]
Man fuck you, "You people"
'Talkin that shit, man

[Guard - talking]
So tell us, Ace
How does it feel to be coming out after all this time?
