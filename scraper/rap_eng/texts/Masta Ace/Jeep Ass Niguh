[Intro}
May I see your driver's license, please? May I see your DRIVER'S
LICENSE, please. What's that in your cassette deck?

[Verse One]
Braniac dumb-dumbs, bust the scientifical
Approach to the course and the force is centrifugal
Can you find your way through the lyrics that be catching them?
Throw another rhyme across the room, they be fetching them
When they take a loss, take a loss to the master and
I throw crazy blows and they know I be plasterin'
All across the room, on the ceilings and the walls too
Punk motherfuckers didn't know I had the balls to
Come around their block with my cock diesel system and
Turned it up to ten and then start to dis 'em and
They didn't wanna battle, if they did, when they saw me
They'da open up the trunk but they tried to ignore me
Hey motherfuckers! I know you hear me calling you
Thought you wanted some but I see that you all into
Frontin', ain't no future in your frontin', so let's get it on
Like Marvin Gaye (hey), take the cash and sit it on
The hood of your bullshit, lowriding Cadillac
Back up your boys and let's start to battle, act
Like, you know, the Masta Ace
Don't play when it come to my bass

[Hook]
"This ain't a blast from the past, it's a boomer from the future"
I'm a Jeep Ass Niguh

[Verse Two]
Driving down the block, like what else should a brother do
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might smother you
Rolling down my windows, yeah, I have a air conditioner
But I got the sound I want the whole world to listen ta
Waiting at a red light, Kentucky Fried Chicken and
Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kickin' and
See this Puerto Rican latin chico, rico, suave
In a red Corolla, ay yo, does he wanna play?
Pulling up beside me, looking like he want it
Show me whatcha got, then watch me get up on it
Holding up traffic but we can't hear they horns
'Cause he got musica grande, yeah he got it going on
But I think I better school 'em, 'cause he don't know the time
So I'm turning up the boom, 'cause he cannot fuck with mine
Brothers hear me from like fifty blocks away, I
Wanna turn their head, so you know I gotta play high
Decibals passing through a residential disctrict
See a few cuties and I turn it up like this quick
Mira, mira man, don't sleep
I got the, I got the, I got the woofers in my jeep

[Hook]
I'm a Jeep Ass Niguh
I'm a Jeep Ass Niguh

[Verse Three]
Black boy, black boy, turn that shit down
You know that America don't wanna hear the sound
Of the bass drum, jungle music, go back to Africa
Niguh I'll arrest ya if you're holding up traffic
I'll be damned if I listen, so cops save your breath
And write another ticket if you have any left
And I'm breaking eardrums while I'm breaking the law
I'm disturbing all the peace cause Sister Souljah said "War"
So catch me if you can, if you can, here's a donut
Cause once you drive away, yo, you know I'm gonna go nut
And turn it up to where it was before, nice try
But you can't stop the power of the bass in your eye
I wonder if I blasted a little Elvis Presley
Would they pull me over and attempt to arrest me
I really doubt-doubt it, they'll probably start dancin'
Jumping on my dick and pissing in they pants and
Wiggling and jiggling and grabbing on their pelvis
But you know my name so you never hear no Elvis (word)
Strictly the hardcore, dirty street-level shit
God's on my side so watch what the devil get
Positivity hitting fifty levels deep
Coming out the, coming out the woofers in my jeep

[Hook]
I'm a Jeep Ass Niguh
I'm a Jeep Ass Niguh
I'm a Jeep Ass Niguh
