"Rolling with a posse is the only way to go"
"U.to the M., D.A. to the D.A."

[Verse One]
Here comes the ill kid acting unruly
Hat on sideways, just like a movie
I don't got no beef, what ya think?
I don't wanna snatch ya link
I just wanna know, where'd you get that drink?
Cause the place is looking kinda packed
Hope they're knowing how to act
As I step with my boys to the back
Boots and jeans are the attire
No dress code
Hear the bass from the amplifier
Like
"Ayo what the hell ya playing?
It's hip hop night, not rock n' roll daying."
Hey DJ won't you play that song
You know the one that keep me dancing all night long
Kid Capri's late on the wheels
There's a Nazi skinhead with stubble
There's going to be some trouble

[Hook]
So, step to the rear
I'm rolling with Umdadda
(U.to the M., D.A. to the D.A.)

[Verse Two]
Hey, eyes are burning and they hurt from the smoke
Yo, somebody's skunking and it ain't no joke
Two big body guards, kinda cock diesel
Standing with the owner cause he's a fucking weasel
Tried to play us for the doe when we do a show
That's not how it go (That's not how it go)
So we had to tell that asshole
Don't be messing with the cash flow
I'm rolling with Ken Do, Blue, Ice Uneek, and wait right here
Yo, I gotta take a leak and it's gonna be a long (long one on ya)
I smell ammonia
Waiting in line on the pissy ass floor and
Hurry up homeboy, it's gonna start pouring
Down my leg, I only had one drink
But I can't wait no more so I piss in the sink

[Hook] {x2}
Step to the rear
I'm rolling with Umdadda
That's right homeboy you better make way
Rolling with a posse is the only way to go
(U.to the M., D.A. to the D.A.)

[Verse Three]
Back on the scene, yo what's the commotion?
So many heads it looks like the ocean
Somebody's brawling, fighting
Punching, kicking
Spitting and biting
I catch a blow but my head's like a rock
I pull out the shank that I keep in my sock
Feels like I might have a jammie to the eye
Next kid that touch me get sliced like a pie
So ya better stop the madness
It's time for the show
Chill with the punches, it's time to say "ho"
And everything stops as quick as it started
The kids that was flipping and acting retarded
Now they dancing and they just won't stop
Cause the DJ put on the hip hop

[Hook]
