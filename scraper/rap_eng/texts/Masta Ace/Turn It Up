Say, turn it up, turn it up, say, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, say, turn it up
Turn it up, say, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Turn that system up and pump it all around the town
Keep the levels high so that you can feel my funky sound
Gotta get with my peeps and see what's goin' down tonight
Volume can't be low 'cause we need to turn it up just right

Turn it up, that's my song
They play it every once in a while
Let me hear it, let me feel it
The system's pumpin', that's my style

In my car or on my stereo
I feel the bass all in my soul
It's got my body feeling rather warm
On a Friday, this is how we roll

Yeah, just turn that system up and pump it all around the town
Keep the levels high so that you can feel my funky sound
Gotta get with my peeps and see what's goin' down tonight
Volume can't be low 'cause we need to turn it up just right

At the party, havin' a good time
Playas come from everywhere, run the same old lines
"What's your name and do you have a man?
Don't talk, just dance right now and listen to this jam"

Mr. DJ, let it play
Play what I've been waiting for
There's a party over here, baby
This is what I say when I walk on through that door

Just turn that system up and pump it all around the town
Keep the levels high so that you can feel my funky sound
Gotta get with my peeps and see what's goin' down tonight
Volume can't be low 'cause we need to turn it up just right

Keep it pumpin', ain't that somethin'
Turn it up and feel the pumpin'
I MC is up in here
So throw your hands high in the air

Turn that system up and pump it all around the town
Keep the levels high so that you can feel my funky sound
Gotta get with my peeps and see what's goin' down tonight
Volume can't be low 'cause we need to turn it up just right

Turn that system up and pump it all around the town
Keep the levels high so that you can feel my funky sound
Gotta get with my peeps and see what's goin' down tonight
Volume can't be low 'cause we need to turn it up just right

Turn that system up and pump it all around the town
Keep the levels high so that you can feel my funky sound
Gotta get with my peeps and see what's goin' down tonight
Volume can't be low 'cause we need to turn it up just right
