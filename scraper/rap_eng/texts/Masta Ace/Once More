[Hook] [Masta Ace]:
Once more for a chosen few
We came here to do what we supposed to do
Spread the word and be tellin' a friend
Yell it now then you yell it again
Once more
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Children of all ages across the world
Once more in the place to be
You're checkin' out the sounds of E-
"MC"

[Verse One] [Wordsworth]:
The marquees lit up, our names in lights
Big enough for you to read, ain't gotta strain your sight
My point of view?
When you look at other crews with mics
They got one or two in the group that you don't like
Sold out ticket booth, backstage we enter through
Pens ready, journalist hold out for interviews
And if you check the press rooms where we dress, food and drinks are out
Think about bringing out special guests
The owners say "what up", the promoter's payin' up
Camera's aim at us, family came with us
The set? We might change it up
Behind curtains, standin', waitin' up
Sound man, watch my hand and raise it up
Introduce the banners hanging up
Then we on
And some never catch where we be
While rhymin', want us to sign hats and CDs
Warmed up by opening acts you see free
We live satellite on TV
Yeah we takin' over

[Hook] [Masta Ace]:
Once more for a chosen few
We came here to do what we supposed to do
Spread the word and be tellin' a friend
Yell it now then you yell it again
Once more
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Children of all ages across the world
Once more in the place to be
You're checkin' out the sounds of E-
"MC"

[Verse Two] [Stricklin]:
Yo, rumor has it there's a brand new group in the game
Here to balance out all you dudes that's stupid and lame
Got love for this, we don't need cupid to aim
The game is changed, let me explain who is to blame
One cat used to have a show on MTV
Another dude done already dropped five LP's
Another cat is from the lower part of NYC
The last dude is somethin' like a pimp, that would be me
Stricklin
Yeah, the mid-west rapper with clout
I got mo' game than most of these rapper's that's out
Half the time I don't even know what they rappin' about
But when I find out, they just might get smacked in the mouth
EMC
I love when great minds collab
You dude's beats be okay, but your rhymes are bad
Find me offensive? Can't even find your dad
Come here dawg, let me sign your pad
EMC nigga

[Interlude]:
"Once more"
Ladies and gentlemen. Today we bring to you..EMC. Well alright!

[Verse Three] [Punchline]:
Yo
Each line I design is changin' the times
Basically what I write and prescribe will save lives
All rise
For the EMC
And my flow ride the track till the shit on E
We blaze beats
Got you lovin' the shit
EMC, Four Brothers like a Singleton flick
Style sick, we spit, face the fact
We takin' over like the U.S. did to Iraq
Fall back
It's the new I.N.C
Basically a new branch on the family tree
We change the game, no way you can play this
Fight a fan for my fam like Antonio Davis
Bone models
Slay chicks
Sleepin' on my stomach is the only time I lie on my dick
My squadron is sick, we don't play those games
Say no names
Basically can't be tamed
We takin' over
