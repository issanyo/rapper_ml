[Interlude: Mike Walker & Duval]
— So how do you think you did today? You were over there with the running backs right?
— I think I did alright, I wasn't as fast as I thought I was. Some of these kids were flying
— It ain't all about speed though. What's up? I'm Mike Walker but everybody calls me Walker
— My name is Duval, what's up? You a fresh man too?
— We all are, pretty much, where you from D? And no offence but I'mma call you D because that's easy to  remember
— I'm from Brownsville, how about you?
— Brownsville? Damn! What's that? Like an hour and a half bus ride?
— Yeah
— Wow, I live right across the street from the school. See them glorified projects over there? That's where I live
— I didn't know black people lived way out here?
— Yeah there's a few families out this way. We definitely outnumbered but we out here, so the Ville huh? Never a dull moment living out there I bet?
— Got that right
