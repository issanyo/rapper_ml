[Verse 1]
I wake up around a quarter to 10
Wash my mouth out with some water n' gin
Throw my dirty drawls in a portable bin, then, that's when i happened to have thought of a friend
Her names Dianne and shes kind of a fan
Light skin, fine bikini line with a tan
Next thing you know i got my nine in my hand
I ain't scared to bust, that's the sign of a man
From the first time that she came in the building
Had thoughts of marryin' and naming the children
Now im revealing how she gave me the feeling
To grab my nine tight and take aim at the ceiling
I bust shots for a chick that's suitable
Small waist, brown thighs, thick n' beautiful
You lookin good, then im quick to shoot at you
Whats up ma? I know what to do with you

[Hook]
It's my nine, I plan to bust it
Reach out with my hand n' clutch it
Go slow, no need to rush it
Go ahead, proceed to touch it
It's my nine
It's my nine

[Verse 2]
My neighbor's wife shaped like an hour glass
Great big breasts, high powered ass
She told me i was cute, now i'm gassed
Better jump my ass in the cold shower, fast
I feel like i just might bust my gun
Trust me hun, you a dime, i lust for one
Now and then shoot it off just for fun
But always take my time, never rush for none
The girls at work like to call me a flirt
If ya knew the real deal y'all would call me jerk
Cus when you look away, i'm all in your shirt
I wanna be the president that's all in your skirt
Yo, i take aim if your name is Jane
A gun bust is almost the same as brain
Down ass chick or the lamest dame
I don't give a damn, what, came is came

[Hook]
It's my nine, I plan to bust it
Reach out with my hand n' clutch it
Go slow, no need to rush it
Go ahead, proceed to touch it
It's my nine
It's my nine

[Verse 3]
Now if you like to bust shots at Vivica Fox
Or you firin' blanks at Tyra Banks
Or you hold ya nina strong for Nia Long
You can catch her at night when she be in her thong
It don't matter if you can't bone or hit it
Get yours whether you alone or widdit
You gotta get a nut, just go on and get it
Most cats like us just won't admit it, yo


[Hook]
It's my nine, I plan to bust it
Reach out with my hand n' clutch it
Go slow, no need to rush it
Go ahead, proceed to touch it
It's my nine
It's my nine
