Man
Dikembe
Mutumbo
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I be the man in front of the fans ganderin'
Standin' in spotlights fam, ya panhandlin'
Adament, most top tens you been ramblin'
Runnin' off at the lips big, Pam Anderson
You's a real sad man, play the mandolin
You sittin' home like, "should, could" with your wood panelin'
Face it, you stuck in the basement and panickin'
Stagnant and can't move, a damn mannequin
Everything you do in your life is self-damagin'
Drug scramblin', raw sex and gun brandishin'
Can't stop, you got shot, the doc bandagin'
Meanwhile, I'm in Spain up in a Spanish inn (Woo)
Bad cutie with the tannest skin
Then, we tellin' the bartender give us ya best brand of gin
Hip-hop's work we got a big advantage in
Ain't rich, not yet, damn, but ya man's managin'

[Chorus]
Understands we can't be stopped, get blocked
You don't wanna get shot
Read my rap sheet, nigga, cl- classics
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit
Understands we can't be stopped, get blocked
You- you don't wanna get shot
Read my rap sheet, nigga, classics
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit

[Verse 2]
Anyways, I spit fierce flows so many ways
I been nice since piggy bank, savin' my penny days
Before the Hypnotiq, Aliz√© and Henny craze
Way before Barry Bonds, guess I'm callin' this Willie Mays (Willie Mays)
While you sittin', spittin' your silly phrase
I been writin' and recitin' something that really pays
That long list is what man wants outta life
The twist is, God won't hear him until he prays
I'm from a block where there's many strays
Many cats boostin' at Jimmy J's
Tryin' to get 'em somethin' that's hot
So when they walk in the spot, they be shinin' like semi-glaze
Salt-N-Pepa, BIG, now plenty grays
Gimme Prem, Marcos or gimme Dres
Gimme Pete Rocks or gimme Blaze
Big up Jazz Jeff, he from Philly where Gillie stays

[Chorus]
Understands we can't be stopped, get blocked
You don't wan- you don't wanna get shot
Read my rap sheet, nigga, cla-classics
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit
Understands we can't be stopped, get blocked
You don't wan- wanna get shot
Read my rap sheet, nigga, cla-classics
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit

[Skit: Shy]
Marco, what up man? It's Shy
You prolly won't get this 'til you land, but yo
I just wanna say, like
What you're doing right now, taking this huge risk
I mean
We always talk about what we'd give up to do this music
And how dope it would be to move to NY, but man
You're actually doing it
Yo, I'm proud of you, bro
Even though some of the homies think you're crazy
You already know I'm rootin' for you, man
Anything you need
I'll be right here every step of the way
Time to make hip-hop history, yo
