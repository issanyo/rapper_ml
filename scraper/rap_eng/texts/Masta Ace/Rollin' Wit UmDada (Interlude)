[Introduction: Masta Ace - Big Daddy Kane - ??? speaking on stage]
And my man Kane
Peace
One two, and you don't stop
-
Ayo one love
-
Masta Ace!
My mellow, my brother
Get on the mic you undercover lover
-
Yeah, before I get into this
I wanna just say congratulations my man Kane on the fourth LP
You know not a lot of artists can do that, get into that number four
Congratulations on that
I wanna say what's up to the whole four building and the whole action posse
Cause they gonna get (it) thick
And uhm... I wanna drop a new style of early MC's
I call this the Off-Beat-On-Beat StyleÂ®
See if you can swing with it, see if you can swing with it
It go like this

[Freestyle]
[Masta Ace]
It is the hippest, ready to rip'is
My Father, dopest on the mic but it's not Ike and Tina Turner on Bob [???]
Not that kid Ice Ice, baby, but I'm nice nice
Confuse you and lose you when I'm sayin' words twice twice
I never quit rockin' rhymes cuz' I'm not a quitter -It's...
Funny, but MC's have more nerve than a clitoris
This kid tried to rip me, goddamn what a dumb dumb
I'm not Cock Deez, but I got V's and I come from
Brooklyn -Nah, that's the peeper, kick a chicken freaka
Give her a little respect like Aretha
Franklin, I keep my money in a bank -and
When my pockets are on "E", I go fill up my tank -and
Drive, my cock into some real tight wet stuff
Don't phone me home when I bone or you'll get snuffed
Quick fast, throw you little no-good, [lause?] you
Not the Jungle Brothers, but boy I'll house you
Uhm...
Open up your ears, hear my rap bitch
Niggas are soft like the titties on a fat bitch
Me and my crew heard those words and they tickled us
Like Ricky Ricardo: "It's just so rediculous!"
Uh-Uhhum... Let's clear the throat -and
Keep on quotin', more shit that I've wrote -and
Full score and--uhm--seven years in the lab -and
I know rap like Mike Tyson knows booty grabbin'
And you don't stop, we keepin' it on, gotta keep it kinda loud
And let me just take this quick picture of the crowd
...Peace
