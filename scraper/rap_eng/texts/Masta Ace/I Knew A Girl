[Intro]:
Sure I know her. She's just some broad I fuck

Hit and run {x8}

[Verse One] [Masta Ace]:
I know a chick name Gina got a sister named Trina
Bitch dead broke but really a big dreamer
Said one day she gon' buy a Lamborghini
Drive through the hood in a sequence bikini
Know a chick named Mable got an ass like a table
One day I seen her in a porno on cable
Her boyfriend Rob found out and he dissed her
Bitch tried to lie said she had a twin sister
Know a chick named Holly, tits like Dolly
Used to play around with my balls like volley
See her at a party and she always tryin' to polly
Bitch got married bought a house out in Raleigh
Know a chick named Gill, bought a home on a hill
A nice little truck with the chrome on the grill
She run with Sharone and Sharone on the pill
They both run the streets and they don't wanna chill
Know a chick named Neice, met her out in D.C
Jheri curl hair, I swear she all greasy
Came to the crib let me take a piece
And left a spot on my pillow like bacon grease

[Hook]:
I'm sorry love, got doe to chase
Onto the next date no time to waste
I gotta go

"Hit and run"

[Verse Two] [Stricklin]:
Yo, I knew a girl named Rhonda
I was real fond of
She was kinda hot, smoked a lot of marijuana
She liked snakes so I showed her my anaconda
Homeless
So I had to bone it in a Honda
I knew a lady named Judy, kinda old but a cutie
Truly had my back when this groupie tried to sue me
Lifted up her robe in court, let me see her booty
So I took her in her chamber and I did my civil duty
Knew a chick named Venus had a crush on my penis
Nice backhand but her serve was the meanest
Sleepin' with her sister till she walked in and seen us
Gave me the finger cause Serena came between us
I met a chick named Rhoda on a road in South Dakota
Let me see her tits for some chips and a soda
Always a fool cause she was cool with the promoter
Never called when I left cause her breath had an odor
Knew a chick named Jojo, lived down in Soho
Had pretty feet and was sweet as hot cocoa
Friends with the Mexicans who like to call her loco
I ain't sweat her, but I let her play with my yo yo
Knew a chick named Cindy, she was real friendly
Didn't eat pork, if I was Mork she was Mindy (nanu nanu)
Drove a nice car and her crib was real trendy
Told me she was rich but the bitch worked at Wendys

[Hook]:
I'm sorry love, got doe to chase
Onto the next date no time to waste
I gotta go
"Hit and run"
Bitch I just wanna
"Hit and run"

"Hit and run"

[Verse Three] [Punchline]:
I got a chick named Jasmine, real great lover
Got huge tits, one bigger than the other
Jasmine's hot, but I wanna fuck her mother
Now my brand new son is a little baby brother
The chick named Denise, stutters when she speaks
I laugh at the sentences she can't complete
Scream my name when we fuck, I ain't trippin'
She sound like a CD when it starts skip-skip-skip-skip-skip-skippin'
Know this chick named Tanya Tucker, oh brother
Hide my wallet every time that I fuck her
Check my pockets every time we kissin'
Cause last time I didn't my shit came up missin'
Know this chick named Beatrice, real great features
Fucked her one time but she can't keep a secret
Got a good job, long hair and nails
She give good brain but is dumb as hell

[Hook]:
