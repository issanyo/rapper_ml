[Intro]
It goes a one, two, three and-

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Hear the gospel when it's chosen scripture
It's the hitman for hire when he goes and gets ya
Kinda violent when I hold and hit ya
Yo, we can take this in the alley like a bowlin' picture
You'll get two 'cross your lips like Sanford & Son
These dudes fall for these hoes, won't stand for they sons
These boys young and they lost and in need of directions
When everything falls apart, you don't see the connections
Karma is a bitch and she packin' a Glock
And you 'bout to get shot like you back on the block
Yo, I go to war like I'm wearin' fatigues
Stevie Wonder in his prime, there's hair in them beads
Not tryin' to say I'm a musical genius
But understand, what I done, you don't usually see this
This is thirty years of excellence
Cop your tickets, see ya all at the next event

[Chorus]
EMC
In the place to be
As it is plain to see
Dig it now
One, two, three
Ace, Strick, Words
EMC

[Verse 2: Stricklin]
Yo, I know you miss me, yup, I've been gone for a minute
It's 'cause I got a real job, somethin' like a lieutenant
Tryin' to find me, truth be told, to be perfectly honest
More than likely I'm in the mill with the homie Onyx
Or in the lab with Marco, 'cause him and Ace is cookin'
'Bout to eat on this beat in a small place in Brooklyn
The game's mine, your little space is tooken
Shorty a G, of course she with me, that's just in case you lookin'
Throw on some Timbs, now your life is gully
That's absurd, you still a nerd and your wife is ugly
Your credit bad and rappin' is not your forte
I did verses for 4K out in Norway
It's EMC 'til they drop the casket
It's no question, so please don't even stop to ask it
Wordsworth, Masta Ace and me
Wherever we at is the place to be, three

[Chorus]
One, two, three
EMC
In the place to be
As it is plain to see
Dig it now
One, two, three
Ace, Strick, Words
EMC

[Verse 3: Wordsworth]
Every bar marvelous, I'm a artist and novelist
Full of danger like a bullet chamber in a revolver is
Came as far up to par, to y'all, a narcicisst
Where the ball party is I'm a star like Bob Marley is
Watch your car, parkin' it while you shop in in Target
Have your car targeted to blow you up your car startin' it
We start arguin', I'll take a blade and then sharpen it
Like Goodfellas, stab you in the trunk on your car carpetin'
The other theory, the life of this brother's scary, he
Is blessed like my mother is Mary and God fathered it
My album release date on your forehead I'm carvin' it
For marketin', found guilty then have the President pardon it
Your arms too short to box with God, get dropped and scarred
And bar-for-bar I'm too smart for y'all to spar with it
Bring it back 'cause you're involved with it, talkin' solvin' it
But the bottom of the problem is y'all part of it

[Outro]
