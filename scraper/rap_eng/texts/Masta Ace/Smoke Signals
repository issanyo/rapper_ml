[INTRO]
Ah damn, it’s been a stressful time!
But today, we chillin’!

[HOOK: Mac Miller]
( .. Let the smoke signals guide you back home like Indians
And lend the spliff and bullshit with my kinsmen
The Yuengling coolin me down from the heat on the streets
Take me back to those times of peace
Let me see those leaves turn a free and kick flows I see
And think back to chicks who love my magic stick .. )

[VERSE 1]
Let the smoke signals guide you back home, like the indians
Imma fuckin’ king and this world is my dominion
I’m killin’ ‘em, recordin’ till like 3 AM
I just wanna raise the number I see on the ATM
I wish I could go back to a time of tranquility, facility
A time of great unpredictability, and live a life that’s worry-free
Baby you should come with me, to a place so heavenly
She callin’ me her sweet pea, peaceful like the olive tree
We gonna live that lavish life, baby that’s a guarantee
Workin’ towards this law degree, I’m feelin’ like a major key
Flowin’ on them collard greens

[HOOK: Mac Miller]
( .. Let the smoke signals guide you back home like Indians

The Yuengling coolin me down from the heat on the streets
Take me back to those times of peace
Let me see those leaves turn a free and kick flows I see
And think back to chicks who love my magic stick .. )


[VERSE 2]
Plan to be like these rappers I’ve admired
For myself they have inspired, this music
My soul, it has acquired and I’m tired of being tired
Issues deep inside through my music those subside
Let the smoke signals guide you back home like the indians
Bitch I’m an olympian, stay above the median
Hard like obsidian, colder than amphibian
Send you to oblivion
Philosophic like I’m winian?
O.G. when I spit inside the booth
Speakin’ nothin’ but the truth
Takin’ sips from the fountain of youth
Most say a picture’s worth a thousands words
‘Kay now, suck my dick
How was it? Magnificent

[HOOK: Mac Miller]
( .. Let the smoke signals guide you back home like Indians

The Yuengling coolin me down from the heat on the streets
Take me back to those times of peace
Let me see those leaves turn a free and kick flows I see
And think back to chicks who love my magic stick .. )

“I’m mad at you because you’re smoking with the patch on!”
“Gi-give daddy the cigarette, please”
“Drop the cigarette! Step on it!”
“Give me the cigarette”
“No!”
