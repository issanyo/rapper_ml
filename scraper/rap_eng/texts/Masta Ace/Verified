[Verse 1: Punchline]
Now guess who's this abstract, ready for war
It's not a game but we came back to settle the score
It's not a hobby, tonight, I'mma catch a body
Who the best out? I'm leaving no doubt, like Gwen Stefani
You catch nice hardly, ever the worst spitting
Each verse disperses some of the worst venom
Reverse the Earth's spinning and take it back
To that New York 90's, golden era of rap
My era was full of crack cocaine
This era makes me wanna blow my brain like Kurt Cobain
I'm rolling with great dames, not the kind that bark
These chicks can have the money, never have my heart
I fuck and get my groove on
Smack her on her ass 'till her tone of bottom's red like Luie Vuitton
And keep it moving on, to the next one
Then the next one, cause we the best, uh

[Chorus: Lady Leshurr]
Cause it's all in your mind
Now watch will fall into time
It's a wrap so now we all intertwined
From the morning to night if it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Now watch as we fall into time
It's a wrap so now we all intertwined
From the morning to night if it's all in your mind

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
I'm here to inflict damages on all these amateurs
Who think they want a piece of me like managers
Get the guard pass and bandages
Cause everyone know it's easy to get ate like sandwiches
All I need's a DJ and some cold cuts
And for kicks I make a mixed crowed go nuts
First I spit it, and everybody know I shit it
But won't admit it, so I bounce like old struts
Let me break it down for y'all like machinery
EMC seem to be the best on the scene to me
All guts, four busts on a tour bus
And that's a good look like scenery
That's our face on a postcard, most squads
Look at us and point at us and say "those gods"

[Chorus: Lady Leshurr]
Cause it's all in your mind
Now watch will fall into time
It's a wrap so now we all intertwined
From the morning to night if it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Now watch as we fall into time
It's a wrap so now we all intertwined
From the morning to night if it's all in your mind

[Verse 3: Stricklin]
I'm from the Midwest, the slang'll tell a whole story
I hate when old niggas be living off they old glory
When y'all was hot, JFK was probably still alive
That's word to Kendrick, this niggas just tryna kill my vibe
Last album I was pissed, now I'm pissed off
Like when the top on your drink's too hard to twist off
And you can miss me with your overrated hour-show
I'd rather watch paint dry, or a dead flower grow
And since we here, let's get a bunch of shit clear
Career's alive, even though you niggas swear it died
And it's too late to run now, there's nowhere to hide
And I tweet better, and my shit ain't even verified
Stricklin, yeah respect is what you need to pay
Go right ahead if you got some shit you think you need to say
But if not, shut the hell up, and leave today
And let the eMC boys properly lead the way

[Verse 4: Wordsworth]
At Lolapalooza higher than La La and Luda
Rock with Nas in Aruba then Lady Gaga in Cuba
But I wild then I [?] on Youtube
Put your face inside a pile of manure in front of thousands of viewers
Being browsed by consumers who only found it as humor
Within an hour or sooner it get around like a boomer
Like LeBron with the heat, I'm surrounded with shooters
When I brainstorm my mind it's like a cloud for computers
