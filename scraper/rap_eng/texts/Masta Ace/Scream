I'm about to let go, gotta let the world know
[?] down as long as I can (I'm sorry, but)
[?] 'bout to start a riot now
Now I scream it out loud as I can

And if somebody hear me, yes you gonna hear me
Feelin'
Sometimes you gotta scream (scream)
Let it out, scream (scream)
[?] as long you can stand
Sometimes you gotta...

[Part 1: Masta Ace]
It's the middle of november the landlord told me that
He ain't gon' be on 'til the middle of december
The hot water's cold and the stove on a fritz
Opussum - the sink, stink, mole on the gritz

Turn on the cable, but all I get is fuzz
The stains on the rugs and there's bugs on the table
Who know if I was able, I move in the morn'
The natives fight at midnight, all the way to dawn

Sorry for the yawn, but I ain't slept in weeks
The Pipes in the shower got two seperate leaks
7-day [?], bangin' on my door
Backtooth sore, but I can't afford the dentist

Take a peace of string, I tie it to a knob
About to feel the pain like I'm lyin' to the mob
Some lady with a bible is 'bout to be aseen
Then I swing the door open and I scream (Ahhhhh)

Scream and you arrive at the last part of you rope
And people in the neighborhood make it harder to cope
And everybody wanna know how much more they could borrow
[?] keep it scorin', I heard you're tourin' tomorrow

[Stricklin]
Yeah Ace, the whole city thinks that I'm richer than Diddy
Poppin' bottles with models, up in the club wit' Fitty
Lookin' for handouts, thinkin' that I'm ballin' crazy
I work hard, they all are lazy, you feel me?

[Wordsworth]
I feel you, U.S. police issues are major
A prejudice, arrested with no reason, in cages
Engage us, aggressive, with upsetting behaviour
Had me handcuffs, 'nuff beat down, and been tasered

[Stricklin]
And I be gettin' profiled on a daily basis
The say they tryin' to fight crime [?] races
The bills pilin' up to the flippin' ceiling
I'm frustrated, I hate this feeling

I just wanna scream!

[Part 3: Wordsworth]
To my fans, I can't stand social networks
Most of y'all cool, but I met fools and met jerks
Update my status on facebook
Then you post your video and my comments, so I take looks

That's pretty rude, got me in a bitchy mood
On Instagram y'all showin' pictures of your food
My followers bigger, I don't follow, you bitter
Cause I won't help you to get verified by Twitter

Do somethin' with the time [?]

Do a verse for free? A verse, no fee? No, Sir!
I ain't ask you to do the verse for me!

I searched the sea, from Earth to Mercury
Certainly I'm the best the universe can see
No stacks in your purse to disperse some G's
[?], it ain't worth to be, I'm gone!

[Hook]
