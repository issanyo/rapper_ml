[Masta Ace - talking]
Now I know you're probably wondering
What I was doing in that hotel room with Fats Belvedere
Sorrounded by bags of cash and credit cards
And counterfeit cashier's checks
I can't front, I'm asking myself that same shit right now
Well it all started a few months earlier
It was the first day of summer
In the borough of Brooklyn
