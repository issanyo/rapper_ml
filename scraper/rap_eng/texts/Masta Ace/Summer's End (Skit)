[Intro: Duval]
The year is 1980, September
Almost time for jackets and corduroys
Back in June I graduated from 8th grade, I had a fun summer
According to my moms, she was supposed to be getting this new job and we were gonna move to Atlanta this fall
I thought I was gonna start on a high school right there
Well, it turns out...
That job that moms was counting on, fell through
And we gonna be staying right here, in Brooklyn
Now we in the panic
Try to find a school at the last minute, oh boy
