[Interlude: Coach Riley & Duval]
— I'm coach Riley, head football coach here at Sheepshead Bay High School. I understand that this is the eighties and technology is taking over. Everybody has got a Walkman now, movies about Poltergeist, E.T. I grew up in a simpler time, people had respect and integrity. If you had a beef with a guy, you met him at the park. You slugged it out one on one, bloodied each other's nose. That's it! Real simple. We didn't believe in the stuff they do now. Jumping a guy and pulling a knife or something? That's why I love coaching, I'm teaching these guys to be men. Not lowlifes or degenerates
— Hey coach, what we wearing again? Just helmets right?
— You guys really don't listen, do you? Yeah, helmets! Cheese and crackers. What is wrong with these kids today?
