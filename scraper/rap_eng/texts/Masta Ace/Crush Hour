My nickname is the M-U-S to the I-C Man

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Good morning World
What you doing on the corner girl?
Up with you, in the crib's where I want to curl
Cause you look so good, it's a crying shame
I'mma make a U-turn, come back around, try again
Tryna see if maybe I can get another glance
Blew the first one, maybe get another chance
Every car that roll by, cats is peepin' at you
Some are rolling down their windows and they beepin' at you
They all flirtin', tryna offer you a lift to work
But every dirt just really want to lift your skirt
I know you wishing this bus'd come the hell along
So fly you was born with propellers on
Amazing Grace in my face like the famous hymn
You looked at me, thinking I was same as him
Nah wait, I just want to take you on a date
You know, wine in the glass, food on the plate
Supermom, tired of putting on the cape
I could tell from your face that you want a break
I could see that you really need a vacation
So I'm circlin' the block, trying to make haste
Great taste, I could tell you're not a cheap date
But this cop keeps telling me to keep straight
He don't know we got a date with destiny
This construction on the road is really testin' me

[Hook: Pav Bundy]
I just can't wait 'til I get back to you
(get to you baby)
Long as you know that I'm trying to get to you

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
What's it like to have the whole world barkin' at you?
Dudes should be talkin' to you but they talkin' at you
I just need to keep my eyes on the road
But I'm thinkin' 'bout them caramel thighs a la mode
See, look how you put a guy in beast mode
I made a wrong turn; damn man the street closed
I'm just trying to make it back to the bus stop
See if I could pick you up like a dust-mop
And I know everyday you got a dead guys
Before they ever get a word in edgewise
I'm at the red light, half a block away
I see the bus turn off of Rockaway
This is not how I thought that it was gonna end
I guess I'm left to sit here wondering
And as you get on the Number 10
I think about us and everything we could've been
