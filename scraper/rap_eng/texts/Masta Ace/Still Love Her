[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
She was the love of my life
Compared most closest to the love for my wife
But don't tell her though, we grew up together
In the projects, yup, she was tough as leather
In the roughest weather, when the rain and the thunder came
She kept me dry, gave me food for my hunger pains
The summer came, then went and came and went again
Autumn bliss turned to winter sin
Then the leaves fell and the ground froze
And like every other dude was tryna brown-nose
Tryna get with her, tryna lay with her
Tryna see if they can move in and stay with her
They wanted to play with her but I knew they wasn't serious
I was watchin' from the cut, I was furious
'Cause I know they only here for a season
It's hard to explain what's the reason why I still love her

[Chorus: Masta Ace & Pearl Gates]
That's how much I love you
Yeah, I still love her
That's how much I love you
Speakin' from the heart, we had a little spark
I never thought that it would fall apart
But yo, I still love her
That's how much I love you

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
We broke up a while, she wanted to spread her wings
Wanted to upgrade her life and get some better things
I'm talkin' nicer cars, I'm talkin' fatter checks
I was jealous of the men that probably had her next
I was past tense, they was present tense
I been fiendin' to get back with her ever since
But once love is lost, it's hard to find again
And you can't use that same tired line again
About we soulmates and we was meant to be
That doesn't hold weight, let's keep it century
She moved down south, now she a southern girl
And now she's being all exposed to this other world
And now she dressin' funny and she speakin' different
She even dance funny, ayo she freakin' different
She started datin' dudes out in the ATL
And it's really hard for me to wish my baby well
Was they violatin' or was I hatin'?
She started using different drugs, her eyes dilatin'
She started sippin' syrup, started poppin' E
But I really can't treat her like my property
Being possessive, being so obsessive
I am bound to push away from being so aggressive
But I can't help myself, I don't know how to act
Man, there ain't no runnin' from the fact that I still love her

[Chorus: Masta Ace & Pearl Gates]
That's how much I love you
Uh-huh, I still love her
That's how much I love you
Speakin' from the heart, we had a little spark
I never thought that it would fall apart
But yo, I still love her
That's how much I love you

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
As I look back and analyze it all
I realize now I fantasized it all
She was never mine, I guess I had it wrong
I thought that it was love just 'cause we had a song
But with hindsight, they say it's 20/20
You get the limelight, you make a pretty penny
You think you own the girl, you think she yours forever
You think she layin' down and givin' up them drawers forever
As a younger man in my adolescence
I was tuned in to her, yeah, I had her essence
And she made me glow, yeah, she made me shine
That was 'bout the time that I made her mine
And that was 'round the time that we became official
And it's really hard to say when shit became a issue
Yeah, it's hard to pinpoint when it became a mess
Listen, all I'm here to do is try to stress that, yes, I still love her

[Outro: Pearl Gates]
Sweeter than a kiss from a rose you gave me
So much love in life
I'm not playin' no games, I swear you saved me
It's too hard to explain
You take away my pain
Can't deny you still run in my veins
I still love the way you light my flame
And I won't leave you even though you changed
That's how much I love you
That's how much I love you
That's how much I love you
