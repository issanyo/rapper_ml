[Intro]
This life we're livin' is real
This life we're livin' is is too real
This life we're livin' is real
Rude boy
This life we're livin' is is too real
This our god body business
Gunshot remorse and now you're-

[Verse 1]
This ain't no penny-ante beggin' y'all to gimme Grammys
This is soup kitchen edition feedin' twenty families
Chiraq, bullet, bloodstain on Timmy's jammies
Need a flak jacket that's Rat Packish, now gimme Sammy
David Junior, man, I think we coulda made it sooner
Hmm, somethin' smells fishy like a plate of tuna
Nah, they can't hold me back like a Diddy song
With Ma$e on the verse, my first stint been pretty long
Yeah, my city's strong, but it used to be Herculean
Pioneers, these tryin' years have hurt the meanin'
Of what it mean to be born and raised in the rotten
Apple with the worm it's like what we learned is forgotten
I surmise, the difficult arise when you hypnotized
'Bout this dirty game that's hard to clean like chicken thighs
What you witnessin' is one of them different guys
Seated at a table where you aren't able to sit with Gods
Nah

[Chorus]
This life, this life we're livin' is too real
This life we're livin' is real
Rude boy
This life we're livin' is too real
This our God body business
Gunshot remorse and now you're-

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' about those days out in the park are very sentimental
And they come to life whenever Marco's on the instrumental
And of course when your boy is on the pen and pencil
Raps like this from day one have been essential
It's the quinticential voice from The 'Ville
The weakest in the herd be the choice for the kill, chill
And the loudest in the room be the weakest
Sounds of retribution comin' through your speakers
And it knocks, that's 'cause M.P. is on the MP
See how your prayers compared to theirs are empty?
And when this type of hope is under the microscope
You see the oppressed was never blessed with the right to vote
'Cause they locked us up and grabbed all of them rights back
Confederate flags on the mall, do we fight back?
And swastikas spraypainted on a synagogue
Y'all don't understand, it's a different plan when you been with Gods
Nah
Y'all don't understand

[Chorus]
This life we're livin' is too real
Don't get it twisted
This life we're livin' is real
Rude boy
This life we're livin' is too real
This our God body business
Gunshot remorse and now you're-

[Outro]
It's real
Gunshot remorse and now you're-
This our God body business
