[Skit: Mom]
Hey Marco, it's your mother
I just watched the new video for your new song, "Nostalgia"
Wow
Son, I have to say
When you wanted to go to New York
I was worried
I didnâ€™t understand your passion
But I knew that I wanted and I needed to support you
But now, after seeing this awesome video
With you and this guy Ace
You make a great team
His voice fits your music beautifully
It's like magic
I'm so proud of you
I knew you were gonna do this
You were really gonna do this
Okay, call me later
Love you
