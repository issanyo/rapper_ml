[Interlude: Duval]
Wow, I can't believe four years went by that fast
It seems like just yesterday I was a freshman
Just hoping I would make the team
Now here it is, graduation day
I'm kind of looking forward to college, I guess
Rhode Island is a long way from Brooklyn, I know that
I wonder how this is all gonna turn out
Like, what kind of job, what kind of career am I will have?
Though whatever it is, I hope it's something I love to do
[Yo Duval let's go!]
Ok! Looks like the limo is here, gotta go y'all
Peace in the Middle East
