[Intro]
Yeah
That EMC, boy!
Word!

[Part 1: Stricklin]
Stricklin, fresh up off the streets of Milwaukee County
Heard niggas was lookin' for me, but now you found me!
I'm a king, you're a pawn, we dont move the same
A certified hot boy, but not Juve or Wayne
Life is great, sunshine, and the feeling is good
Fire Lieutenants got brand, but I'm still in the hood
2008, dropped "The Show" and it was well received
Dope rhymes and dope beats, it was well conceived
Where we go from here? Ain't no tellin'
But the album was the shit, even the skits had 'em LOLin'
Masta Ace, Wordsworth, my partners in rhyme
Angry Merch, Powermalu, my brothers in crime
DJ Rob, Filthy Rich, it's family first
M3's in the race, and we plan to be first!
Now we're all startin' to see our success
The people know, EMC is the best!
So let's go! Yeah!

[Hook: Powermalu]

[Part 2: Wordsworth]
On a yacht with four decks, out in Rio
Takin' off your wife's corsette, playin' Neo
I never lose, now I worry 'bout bruisin' my ego
The four best was a quartett, now trio
The other beatin' rap groups, who got the best bars?
It's me, Stricklin and Ace, so who the rest are?
My psycho analysis, [?]
[?]

[Hook: Powermalu]

[Part 3: Masta Ace]
It's the killer-three, the one-two - the trilogy!
Our abilities, a silly fee, but really free
The magic number like De La, we Gladys Summer
It's [?] me in a quarantine, they had us under
Have been lifted, now we cover the earth's surface
The smaller corners of the every map with the word "service"
Yeah, they got us on, the signal was not as strong
Y'all get on, you perform, but y'all spit your verse nervous
Your simple set get crushed by the triple threat!
Let us on, we goin' long like [?] surfers
My shirt [?], y'all don't know how the logo look
These rap lyrics, the rock beat, and the gogo-hook
Or it's the gospel, the nominations of Pena Castell
This rap vision's your baptism, and then it got you
Cold name for the whole game, it's EMC!
Fans camp outta the airport, like TMZ
Yeah!

[Hook: Powermalu]
