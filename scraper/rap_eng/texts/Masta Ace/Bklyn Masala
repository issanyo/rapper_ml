[Verse 1]
I met her on the corner of Gates and Bedstuy
It was only right that I approached and said hi
Cause she looked like no other chick I ever saw
She was on her way coming up out the cornerstore
I asked could I carry your bags and walk her home
I can tell she was new in New York just from her tone
Cause she wasn't that typical rude and ignorant, teeth-sucking and
Eye-rolling telling me to leave her alone
We dipped and we yapped, we chit and we chat
About this and that and where she lived at, yeah
This may sound kinda Wu Tang Clan-ish
But this butter-pecan honey was not Spanish
She lived like three blocks from my man
In New York for six months, moved from Pakistan
Well that explains the strange accent and the strange clothes
And that cute little diamond in your nose
She said, I gotta wear this gear every Sunday but
You gotta see how I look come Monday, word
Meaning I can see you again, maybe
Give you a call, take you out on the weekend
She winked at me and kinda laughed
Ripped a piece of the grocery bag and wrote her math
You can bet your last damn dollar
That I'mma give you a call, Brooklyn Masala

*scratches*(Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you) - Nas

[Hook]
Can we walk and talk, share our worlds
I'm feeling you a whole lot more than most girls
If you give me the number I'll holla
I wanna see you again Brooklyn Masala
B to the K to the
B to the K to the
B to the K to the L to the Y to the N

[Verse 2]
On our first date, knocked on the door around eight
When she came down she smelled good and looked great
She had the tight Frankie B's on, white on white Ones
A pink bubble goose and pink bubblegum, I'm like, damn
Even pink Chanel shades, her long black hair was done up in box braids
She didn't have the Maybeline face, that was all dead
Instead she had a red dot on her forehead
C-cup's pumping, looking real ill
You wanna see Lord Of The Rings or Kill Bill
She looked at me and said, neither one
Cause there really ain't no Black stars in either one
So what you wanna do girl
She kinda blushed then
We settled on dinner for two at Justin's
The food was good with no surprises
We had the barbeque shrimp as appetizers
We had the cat fish main course, a few drinks
Then out the front door like Main Source
We stepped out into the big city
She said, the Times Square lights are so pretty
We caught a cab, back to the lab
Stopped kissing long enough to pay the tab
She said, I think we got a nice future
That night learned all about the Kama Sutra, my Masala
