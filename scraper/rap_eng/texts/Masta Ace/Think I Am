[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Look fam, you can be the man
Got young chicks moving mad grams on Peter Pan
I'm not blind, I can see the scam
Talk tough, but y'all a bunch of girls like the cheetah band
I'm a leader and you a follower
Your goal hollow and your ho was a swallower
She put it down like a report
But her box smell like South Street Seaport
What a odor black, fact
When I got her in the sack jack boy I couldn't hold her back
Cause her bottom is thick like a hippopotamus
Tramp stamp on her lower back
See I know the facts, the hole filled me in
Her best friend is a twin named Lillian
I'm going really in, I'm really going in
Foul, I bust on that towel that you throwing in

[Hook x2]
Who you think I am?

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
I tried to holler outside when she was getting out of vibe
Guess she must got that parking lot Alzheimer's
Cause now I found her, cozy at the bar
Guess at that point she ain't know she had a star
I can't explain what might've gotten into her
Cause now your conversation got friendlier
Seen me and ran with your devious plan
And thinking you're gonna drink all those premium brands
It's different when you ain't got to hear no price
Cause she was just nurse Jackie with that Smirnoff Ice
Yeah I caught that, you and that short cat
Even sold the brush off after he bought that
What the fuck, he ain't make you drink quota
And as for tricking, them days been over
Jedi mind tricks won't work if your brain Yoda
And vision of champagne was shipped, think soda

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: MF Doom]
Big up, Aceâ€”I'm glad I had a chance to flow with him
Just last summer me and my mans did a show with him
In Montreux, hit the stage, I'm like go get 'em
He even had the soulless folks rocking with no rhythm
Marco Polo was on was on the wheels and on point
They did Jeep Ass Niguh, I'm like that's the joint
Some old school heads remember who was who
Brooklyn was in the house, even the newbies knew
Before the Masta left the stage from doing the do
Blew off the roof with a tribute to Guru
First time I met the brother felt like I knew him forever
Too clever, album dedicated to his mother
I thought of mine at the same time, we growing up
I know they proud of they baby boys we blowing up
Only got one, won't ever forget her
Make sure you let her know you love her, when you with her, kiss her
