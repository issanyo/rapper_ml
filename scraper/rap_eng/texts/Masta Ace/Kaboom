[Stricklin]:
Yo, I walk through landmines
I juggle hand grenades
That's nothing, like how I'm snuffin' all them plans you made
The drawing board is what you need to go back to
Your whole crew sucks and you wack too
I'mma Tweet that
I'm from the midwest
Dawg, we good and grimey
You can take me out the hood, but the hood inside me
I'm living it up
Milwaukee's Best, I'm throwing it up
Punch and Clap put me on the track I'm blowing it up

[Masta Ace]:
I was blessed with the best ability
Spit rhymes in a way that would ensure that the rest are feeling me
I tried to pay the bills, got checks for Hilary
To buy studio time in the best facility
I wanna be the bomb in the booth
Got dynamite strapped to my chest and I'm armed with the truth
And you know I'm not harming the youth
I am teaching 'em how to be explosive
I'm reaching 'em now
Let's go

"I'm the mechanic with a pipe bomb to fix your car, kaboom" - Xzibit 'Concrete'
"You think you nice as me, haha you'se funny nigga" - Big L 'Put It On'
"Leave me in the deck too long I'll blow up your box, boom" - Royce Da 5'9" 'Boom'
"Boom, ba-ba-boom, uh, there you go bastard!" - M.O.P. 'Pounds Up'

[Punchline]:
Can I get a Soulclap? Perhaps y'all niggas should duck low
Gunshot to my hood, similar to a drum roll
Sound clash
From the booth to the big screen
Big dreams, like Ms. Wallace I do Big things
First in the booth to set it off
In one take, watch me nail it like pedicures
And dead 'em all
Meet your fate when it's time
I'm married to the game with a dame on the side
It's my time, the doe stacker
I'm trying to touch a mill/Amil, I ain't talking about the female rapper
Style way better than yours, you're not a factor
Like working out, you gon' feel it the day after
The best ever
I took an oath I'm the truth
I'm a walking time bomb that explodes in the booth
I came for the loot, got it just in time
I'm a human landmine, the name be Punchline

[Wordsworth]:
The fuse is lit
Countdown, kaboom from ticks
Body blown and reduced to bits
Dedicated to the love of my music gifts
Like red is to Blood and blues to Crips
You can't like that album, the reviews are fixed
Without autotune, dudes can't choose a hit
Heated at the features I've done
Cats send me back to songs, my vocals low when the music's mixed
Don't be cheap, get it mixed right, the queues and pitch
Then pay to get it mastered, use your chips
Think you nice as me? You would like to be, spend your life to be
Write to me, I'll send you the price of my writer's fee
Write songs all day until the light is gone
Write bars till the stars and the night is formed
Turn the mic on
The switch will ignite a pipe bomb
That blow off your left and your right arm
