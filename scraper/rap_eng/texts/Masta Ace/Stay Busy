[Intro]
EMC
Stricklin
Punchline
Wordsworth
Masta Ace
One question: What ya’ll been up to?

[Verse 1: Wordsworth]
Taking my daughter to school
Contact who’s important, recorded by noon
Never boring, touring New Orleans in Jordans and jewels
The home to my floor and pool, the water is cool
Contracts me in fax to my loyal review
Whaddap with you?

[Verse 2: Stricklin]
Ain’t nothin’, just making joints that cha’ll to coppin’
On top of that plenty knowledge dropping’ , the color popping
A sneaker pimps it was more hoppin’ with a lot of shoppin’
Styling on is not a problem
I stay busy, Punch get em

[Verse 3: Punchline]
Back to hit em with this raw bars
Released the album call Underground Superstars
Lost friends, reroute had to clean house
Since our last CD the scene went south
A lot popping , Masta Ace what you got rockin'

[Verse 4: Masta Ace]
Hit the studio recording with Ed
A&E dropped right when you thought it was dead
Man before you had that thought in your head
I instead had to keep the fans fed like water and bread
Can’t sleep man it move like a portable bed
EMC and we forging ahead
We ain’t stopping either
You may buy us on the low like a (cup?) of reefer
But have no fear fam , play it loudly
EMC man say it proudly
Is us!

[Chorus]
See the fans were wondering where we been
But we’ve been right here, staying busy all year
We ain’t go nowhere
And the plan still the same we still on in
We been right here, staying busy all year
We ain’t going nowhere

[Verse 5: Punchline]
Since the show up, and hustling on the hard ground
This rap race I heard it over this hard times
In my mind wondering if I should rap or stop
Rap or not, I need my space like an astronaut
Real shit, Masta Ace what you dealin’ wit’?

[Verse 6: Masta Ace]
Last year I predicted I was going be on
Best album of the year, Son of Yvonne
Man, the critics ain’t wanna be wrong
But they was way off
I stay busy,no day off
How about chu?

[Verse 7: Wordsworth]
Let me get you updated on my latest
While, I voted for Obama
Promoted my album
People called in Uganda about the open up in Ghana
Soaking in the sauna, on a boat in  the Bahamas
On the ghostly ass piranhas we went doper than Rihanna
What the deal?

[Verse 8: Stricklin]
With this lanes and their egos that’s quick to bruise
Moping, running round, hoping that Strick a loose
Your girl though my lines was slip to use
Then I scored, I’m all in your crib dancing like Victor Cruz
Light's out ***** flip the fuse
Cuz I’ve been in Germany and South Africa twice
Canada too, damn was South Africa nice
And I’ve been wanting to go there like for like half of my life
Now I did cuz my rappin’ is nice , I stay busy *****

[Chorus]
See the fans were wondering where we been
But we’ve been right here, staying busy all year
We ain’t go nowhere
And the plan still the same we still on in
We been right here, staying busy all year
We ain’t going nowhere
