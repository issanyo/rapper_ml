[Skit: Marco & Dad]
So you really gotta do this, huh?
Dad
Look, don't get me wrong Marco
I really want you to follow your dreams and all, but, New York?
Pops, that’s where I gotta be
It's either this or L.A. and that's even further from Toronto
The world is a much more dangerous place today, son
You saw what happened in September
New York’s a big target now
Would you stop worrying? I already got this intern gig
My boy Lou has a place for me to stay out in Brooklyn
It's a little basement, but his family isn't charging me rent
I got enough savings for a year
After that we're gonna see what happens
I haven't heard great things about Brooklyn, Marco
Pops, my taxi's here, can you grab the other bag for me?
Alright son, call me when you land
Wanna take some pasta with you?
Dad, I'm good, I'll call you when I get settled
