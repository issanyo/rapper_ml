J Hart, Budamunk, it's ya boy Mast Ace
[?] let's go

Cool, cause I don't get upset
Cool, cause I don't get upset
Cool, cause I don't get upset
Cool, cause I don't get upset

[?] people from multiple sides
Four dimensions full attention and cultural pride
My [?] and extensions that force you to ride
With the windows down, those clowns toss 'em aside
Like onions on a salad, [?]
I got something for your [?], that's actual talent
They be screaming on the track, when in fact [?]
You listen to the best music, now act like I'm [?]
Another one, [?]
Here for the long hole, like Scatman Crothers run
My voice dance on these tracks like doing the Boogal
Every time out you hear something new in the vocal
We between the lines, see what I do to insult you
Intimidate, eleminate your whole crew and approach you
These are [?] words, [?]
Holding the game and the lyrical [?]
Let's go

Cool, cause I don't get upset
Cool, cause I don't get upset
Cool, cause I don't get upset
Cool, cause I don't get upset

I'm a lumberjack knocking rappers down like [?] timber
We playing spades and I'm holding every gang member
In the palm of my hand, like I'm king Simba
Your clothes small little boy like you're king [?]
