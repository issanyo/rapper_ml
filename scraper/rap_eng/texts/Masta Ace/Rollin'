[Saukrates]
Ha, ha
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Ha, ha
Rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
[Hook - Saukrates]
Money makes the world go round
So watch a nigga
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Money makes the world go round
So watch a nigga
Rollin', rollin', rollin'

[Masta Ace]
Yo, yo, I makes green backs of mean tracks
It seems that life ain't nuttin 'but phat cars
And cream stacked two stories high
I wouldn't wanna die, po broke and lonely
No joke I'm only a hop jump and skip from 30
Gotta get my hands dirty
If I wanna see cash thats gon last
I hit you wit a blast, straight from the heart
Yo where's the math, gotta go for broke without a cast
Ain't shit changed but nickels and dimes to G notes
We floats in flush rides and crush prides and jack fakers
Crack makers never left the, neighbourhood
Cash rules everything except me
That's what cream mean, it don't rule the mind
On valentines day nigga, you still couldn't find
The heart to try to step to, fuck wit
Mess wit, your desperate, stop bullshittin' nigga and lets get
All this dough like Pillsbury and I still bury
Wack rappers, in 96 kid I feel very confident its my year too
And my tongue will tear you
Keep rollin' in dough and son I hear you

[Saukrates]
(Make money) the slogan of ghetto dwellers in such
(Take money) the phrase of an organized bank rush
Sittin on top of the dome like Al Capone
Interceptin' drug carriers and taking they home
Popularity can make you a buck but nigga that shit is luck
Solidify, your cash you're the biggest guy
Got tooken out, the bitch caught a disease
Called the plague Saukrates, now who's got the g's
Desperado, get away cars hittin' the throttle
Pinchin' diamonds the size of the lotto
Any kind of hesitation 25 ta life you get
Come out, kickin' Carlito cuz you can't resist
In your world wife and kids become the minority
Cause yens, franks, marks and dollars are priority
On stage frontin' as if the mic makes all your cream
But Father Time paid off the sandman and saw your dream
Nigga quit it, you in it for the cash admit it
Cuz I did it, and never gave a fuck for rap critics
Realize Corleone style, I know some niggas desperate
They'd sell they mother for a seven digit figure
Dont you get it...

[Hook]

[O.C.]
Yo Sauk, yo Ace, what's up wit money over there
Whippin' on the street like he just don't care
He's flambouyant see annoying
Ignant nigga figure he gonna be rollin' all his life
Being the big bad bull motherfucker, what!
Sellin' drugs, you ain't nuttin' but a sucka, uh
Can't free mold your mind mad mushy, intelligents all fuzzy
Get shot street nigga forgot who was he
Hit it to put things in perspective
Do right, don't defy laws of life and be deceased or arrested
Mastermind desgined you had thru a science giver
Mad man dreams of a major alliance
Your world revolved around gold, cars and diamonds
Sluts and scars , draggin behind bars still
The wake up call, face off the jail bully
Takin' your manhood, as thought you had a pussy
Come home seen your man, now the lies arise
Tellin' your man you was fightin niggas twice your size
Your conscious is feelin' it, sippin' a brew
Two ways you got screwed, by the system and a stiff one
Mental swollen and your manhood stolen
Wrecked and got dugout for the price of rollin'
