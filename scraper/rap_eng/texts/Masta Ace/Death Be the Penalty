[Intro: Masta Ace]
Ayyo.  What’s the deal, yo?  Stop playing, yo.  It’s Masta Ace, man.  That’s right.  MA.  I’m repping for DJ Mek, DJ Unknown.  You know how we do it.  Flavor shit, what?  Check this out, rappers

[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
Every season I’m out, I’m hot without a reasonable
Doubt.  Raps, in a pleasing amount, I’m squeezing ‘em out
All this beef is about increasing your clout
Hot rhymes?  I got a decent amount and I'm leasing 'em out
With the option to own.  Stop watching the chrome
Go home, little rascal, and learn that poem
When I mix paper and ink, I'm making you think
It's like pouring a glass of poison and taking a drink
Look.  My teeth is sharp, they're better to eat rappers
Why would you wanna keep at this?  You need practice
I'm well known to inflict pain like knee fractures
If I wrote a book, you'd be dead in the first three chapters
It's a habit of mine to put cats on a rapid
Decline.  You’ll get shot with a knife and stabbed with a nine
Your career's about as stable as a three legged table
I'll put out more records myself than your whole label
You’re talking all of that thug shit like you're so able
The worst thing you did in your life was stole cable
You're too light in the ma-ass to be fighting the Mas’
I’ll throw you right in the grass.  I'm lightning-fast (What?)
I'm nice now.  Shit, I was tight in the past
I’ll throw you right in the dash like a frightening crash
You're like Bruce Willis in Sixth Sense and I'ma show it
And that's 'cause your career is dead, but you don't know it

[Outro: Masta Ace]
Motherfucker.  Anyway, DJ Mek, DJ Unknown, we’re just having fun up in here.  You know what I’m saying?  It’s hip hop shit.  Play that shit, yo.  Stop playing
