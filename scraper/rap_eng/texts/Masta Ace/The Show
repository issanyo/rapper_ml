[Verse One] [Stricklin]:
Got to town at like a quarter to three
3:30, still in the lobby, waitin' on my room key
4:00 I'm in my room watchin' TV
The phone rang it's Words, "What up man? Where you be?"

[Wordsworth]:
Checked in, I'm downtown lookin' for uptown
Still need a cut and the store's about to shut down
I'm pushin' it, I know that I'm already late
I haven't eaten all day, I haven't spoken to Ace

[Masta Ace]:
I'm in the room gettin' dressed, gettin' fresh to death
Push ups, a few sits and an extra stretch
Then a nice hot shower aftershave and powder
Call Punch and tell him I'll be ready in an hour

[Punchline]:
Yo, Ace hit me on the hip about a quarter to six
And I'm with these two chicks, bout to cop me some kicks
Real quick
I'mma see you cats real soon
Bout to cop this one pair and bring 'em back to the room

[Stricklin]:
Back to the lobby like 6:15
Did a drop for a dude, interview for his magazine
At 7:00 I'm off to the radio station
7:35, on the air live

[Wordsworth]:
Hopped in the cab hear Strick on the radio
Turn it up
Tell the driver which way to go
Called in, let people know where we performin'
Ladies free, 18 and up and we recordin'

[Masta Ace]:
I'm in the mirror lookin' clean and tight, a mean sight
Sweatsuit matched the Air Force, green and white
Got the matching bandana
Pose for the camera
Price on the tickets and our names on the banner
EMC

[Punchline]:
Real fast shawty came, got her nut and she passed
'Bout to iron out my clothes, jump my ass in the bath
In the lobby kids want me to put my name on they cast
Call the promoter make sure he got all of the cash

[Chorus] [Ladybug Mecca]:
Somethings I learn from touring town to town
The...place is filling up
So...thank you all, tonight is sold out
Welcome to the show
From touring town to town
The...place is filling up
So...thank you all, tonight is sold out
Welcome to the show

[Verse Two] [Stricklin]:
Back in the van at eight, drivin' to the venue
Sound check, let's see what's next on the menu
8:50 restaurant, I ordered plenty
The food came 9:18, I took a shit at 9:20

[Wordsworth]:
Time for me to go, left the hotel suite
Chased by fans, my room number, the hotel leak
Ran down the staircase, headed towards the limo
Hat fell off, jumped through the car window

[Masta Ace]:
My cell phone ringin', tryin' not to stress this
Cats callin', yellin' put 'em on the guest list
Before we hit the club, stop and cop some bub
For the promoter, this dawg showed us lots of love

[Punchline]:
Sean Jean shirt black and white
Air flights, spit rhymes to the mirror make sure that they tight
Check the song list
See what we doin' tonight
Need to link up with fam and go get me a bite

[Stricklin]:
Yeah, by 10:00 yo it's back to the telly
10:30 jumped in the shower, charged up the celly
Back to the club at 12:00
I'm in the van lookin' at the line wrapped around the block

[Wordsworth]:
Tinted, I look and see the crew from a distance
Security in black by the backdoor entrance
Wheels hit the curb, jump out ready
Recognize my face, security ain't sweat me

[Masta Ace]:
I pull up to the rear, the Ace is here
Backstage, fried chicken and a case of beer
Now I don't drink brew but I'll take a plate
Where the fuck is Punchline, yo he crazy late

[Punchline]:
Check the time, oh shit, ten minutes behind
Hope this cab got wings cause I need it to fly
Five minutes flat dawg, I pull up in the ride
The whole fam's here, now I'm 'bout to go up inside

[Chorus] [Ladybug Mecca]:
Somethings I learn from touring town to town
The...place is filling up
So...thank you all, tonight is sold out
Welcome to the show
From touring town to town
The...place is filling up
So...thank you all, tonight is sold out
Welcome to the show

[Announcer]:
Make some noise for EMC!
