[Interlude: Fats Belvedere]
Welcome to Sheepshead Bay High School
A lot of us never been to this part of Brooklyn, I bet
In this neighborhood we got a lot of Jewish, Irish
And of course, Italian families that send their kids to school over here
In the last few years we've been getting more and more minority kids coming in from all over the borough on the bus
When they get off that 44 bus they know they're a long way from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Flatbush and other areas like that. My name's Fats by the way
I go to class sometimes if I'm in the mood, but usually I just hang out outside with the crew, my closest friends, you know, mostly Italian tough guys. We don't take no shit off of nobody!
Any of these visitors get out of line, huh well, let's just say baseball season can come real early around here;
Around lunchtime...
