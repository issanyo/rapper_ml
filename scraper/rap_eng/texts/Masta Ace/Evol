And understand that we lovin' the hate
People love to be fake
How you think you in love when you ain't?

What it means? That depends on the mood
Gotta watch how it's used
If that's it then we got it confused - like

When you down and out, then they love to see you
When you on top, then they'd love to be you
Why be in it when you've seen what it does?
If you ask my definition of love - it's evil

Yeah, I'm tryin' to cop designer shoes and the socks
The jewels and the watch
Be one of them dudes on top that cruise in the yacht
I won't choose to stop 'til my crews in the 'bach
With twenty-twos on the drop - and we bruisin' the block
The first time I heard All About the Benjamins
I was out tryin' to get the cake like ______
I'm tryin' to get designer names and things
All kinds of change, ain't tryin' to change - look
I don't know what kind of sense it brings
I'm in the hood but in love with expensive things
And I dropped outta school for the cash and the money
To dash with my honey - this passion is funny
Guess you could say she got the best of me
Cause my life outta control, bout to crash like a test dummy
I got a Prada but it don't fit me
Can't risk God to tell me that love gon' get me

And understand that we lovin' the hate
People love to be fake
How you think you in love when you ain't?
What it means? That depends on the mood
Gotta watch how it's used
If that's it then we got it confused - like

When you down and out, then they love to see you
When you on top, then they'd love to be you
Why be in it when you've seen what it does?
If you ask my definition of love - it's evil

If that four-letter word was never heard, then we'd be on better terms
Hurts to say it and not hear it in return
Fiend to fall in it, me, I was more timid
Seen it as me wantin' to be with more women
But I'm not - you the only lady I got
Gave you a shot, it's me and you ain't gotta save you a spot
On the way to Macy's to shop, talking tyin' the knot
Babies'll drop, I pulled over, and it made me just stop
In the car she asked What up with us?
I told her It's all good, I ain't in love, but I do see an us in lust
She said there's us in trust
And in her eyes there's been an us since she had a crush
Replied There's an us in rush
Responded is an us a must?
I said on the up-and-up, you can get out and walk
Cause there's an us in bus
Enough's enough, told her there's an us in fuss
So think of us and hush or there won't be an us to discuss

And understand that we lovin' the hate
People love to be fake
How you think you in love when you ain't?
What it means? That depends on the mood
Gotta watch how it's used
If that's it then we got it confused - like

When you on top, then they'd love to be you
Why be in it when you seen what it does?
