[Intro]
Yeah, you already know what it is man. eMC
Your boy Stricklin, anthem to hip hop. It's my man Nicolay on the drums
I'mma play lead vocals.Yeah, you know how I get down, man
It's eMC, lemme tell you what it stand for

[Verse One] [Stricklin]
Yo, Every Minute Counts dawg
So I'mma rhyme like there's no tomorrow
I gotta style of my own, your little flow is borrowed
Your shit's trash, like a empty glass soda bottle
Your looking for dough to borrow, and mine is a flow to follow
Yeah, this verse kinda ill, well there's lot more to follow
All I need is some rice and a nice ho that swallow
A dime piece that be looking like she's supposed to model
Essential Music Catalog dawg, you know the motto

[Punchline]
E.M.C., Experts Making Classics
Cop two, keep one wrapped in plastic
Bastards spit straight, aim for your neck
Like Saddam, I'mma give y'all the sentence of death
E.M.C
Evil, Motherless, Child
Raised in the ghetto, when my upbringing foul
Wild, come to your show and diss you
A back seat'll be the only chair I give you

"They, they wanna know"
"What it stand for?"

[Verse Two] [Masta Ace]
E.M.C
Excellent Mic Controllers
Each Must Come, fulfill the quota
Every Man Can, prove he's a soldier
This ain't +Chicken Noodle Soup+ with a soda
This be Exceptional Men Collaborating'
Keep on poppin' that shit, we glad you hatin'
Recognize the name, we not new to the game
Y'all freshmen in this thang, we graduating

[Wordsworth]
E.M.C
East and, Mid-west Champions
Amped again so to dance with him, fans tramplin'
Lampin' in my Knicks hat, blue with the mandarin
Matchin' my leather with the eMC brand in it
Easily Murderin' Competition panickin'
Got you scramblin'
Like illegal cable channelin'
Standin' in the presence of perfection, you're examinin'
Stop all the guessin' to your questions, here the answer is

[Hook]
EMC, What it stand for? [x4]
E.M.C. (Stands for somethin')

E.M.C. (Know what I mean?) - Rakim

[Verse Three] [Wordsworth]
Extravagant Music Clique
Don't matter who we pick or choose to spit
Cause we Master the Words on this music tip
Keep the Punchlines tight cause the rules are Strict

[Masta Ace]
Yeah, Everyone Must Contribute, no laxin'

One fourth the fraction
We be the faction, just read the caption
Then once it's read man/Redman, +Time 4 Sum Aksion+

EMC

[Stricklin]
Each Man Can claim another victory
Why don't you play the fifth dawg
Cause you ain't got shit to say
Your neck's sore from bobbin'?
Blame Nicolay
I'm something like a pimp
Cause I stay with something slick to say

[Punchline]
