[Hook: Dappy (Tulisa)]
She know she good
Cuz I'm good in the hood
No need to ask
Just give me that ass (give me that)
Drop it on here
We'll run it back
These are the facts so for those who were sleeping on me
Wake the fuck up, cuz I am back
Don't make me do this
Don't make me, don't make me
This ain't a movie, my life is a movie
Watch me kill em again and again and again
Them man need to realise
That this is my show so they better play their role
Don't make me do this
Don't make me don't make me

[Verse 1: Dappy]
Hattens again cuz I'm at it again
Done with the singing cuz I'm rapping again
Few in the clip, ain't even mine
Somebody there, all of the time
You should be grateful
That I'm at it again got it cracking again
Turned ghost for a sec
Now they're clapping again
Blew a mill on the crib
Take your bitch through the bits cuz you know I really do this ting
My brudda told me break these bitches before you pay these bitches
But you know them bitches love this dick
So lick lick lick, bitch we're bout to hit a lick
Call me later cuz I ain't rolling with you in the whip
We all got shit to do and I am the fucking boss
So I ain't rolling with you, real G fuck off

[Pre-Hook: Dappy]
You should be grateful
That it happened again
Clapping again
Sending bullets through the speakers with a passion again

[Hook: Dappy (Tulisa)]
She know she good (she know she good)
Cuz I'm good in the hood (in the hood)
No need to ask (no need to ask)
Just give me that ass (just give me that)

These are the facts so for those who were sleeping on me
Wake the fuck up cuz I am back!
Don't make me do this (don't make me)
Don't make me, don't make me
This ain't a movie, my life is a movie (this ain't a movie)
Watch me kill em again and again and again
Them man need to realise
That this is my show so they better play their role
Don't make me do this
Don't make me, don't make me

[Verse 2: Dappy]
I never started rapping so I could become a lord on the mic
It's just something we would do when me and my dons were on a hype
And I've been writing all my life
So no-one can't tell me that I blew up overnight
I been brought up in the crisis
Way before the ISIS
Eating sushi on the jet
Before we even had a license
Put whatever on my tab
We never worried about the prices
Dropping bitches in the toilet
Sipping liquor with the pilots
And I ain't even lying I've got money on my head
Pussy I just put 200k under my bed
Fuck dealing with accountants and police
Cash be flying in and out of sweden and belise
So lick lick lick, bitch we're bout to hit a lick
Call me later cuz I ain't rolling with you in the whip
We all got shit to do and I am the fucking boss
So I ain't rolling with you, real G fuck off

[Pre-Hook: Dappy]
You should be grateful
That it happened again
Clapping again
Sending bullets through the speakers with a passion again
