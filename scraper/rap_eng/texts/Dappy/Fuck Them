So now all you wanna know
But where was you when I was broke
Now I see love you've never shown
So what you think I'm dating, I swear we made it
Ah so fuck them, they don't go as hard as me
Who's been claiming that they're ill - fuck them I'm a disease
I put my money where my mouth is, they be lying through their teeth
Oh don't be mistaken, I still hit down a pagon
Ah so fuck them, they don't go as hard as me
I done raise the bar so high no satellite can find me
They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out their sleep
Pissed- pissed that they faded
Burn them they've been cremated, ah

Lies, you've been gassing up them hoes with your bullshit
Coz you've been pissing on your balls with your small dick, (look I got my willy out) hey!
And the camera's on
But nothin' can't be wrong with that, if that's what harry's on
Tarzan's in the booth big, char drying my hand
I ain't showing of my tan, I'm just
Letting my shit, hang on
I'm like half the size of Ricky bitch,
I sound nothin' like Drizzy
It's time I beat up the game like, Chris Breezy did to RiRi
That's just D-A taking the P-P-Y, I'm doing Migi
Them ringtone rappers ain't got no credit
Run rings around and breaks one leg in
Piece o' cake,soft and sweet
I'll piss on them and their royal toilet seats
I shit on them oily freaks, they'll never catch me on a sunbed
Coz' no-one cares about, what the fuck was made in Chelsea
The only way is the streets, don't care what no-one tells me
Started of, ones then, two shots, none left, ten man, one pen, then times that
Aaah, BLOAW, aaah
Pussy roll on my carpet, coz' the king of the jungle just took the piss out the muppet
Took a shit turn into rookie, then wiped his ass with an artist
Didn't even get time to flush it coz' the fucking thing charted (haha)
It's over you're finished shut up, you dickheads be quiet
I'm stuffing my face and I'm taking pussy, you on a diet
You the type to go to Gucci
Pick up a hat just to try it, take a picture
Post it on twitter then don't even buy it
You cat, you don't hustle, you just listen to nip CD the only strap
You ever is what's on the top of your kick's G? I got strap
Once before and you can even ask Tinchy
I got them out my shit, BRAP
And it wasn't officially, you see my chain's linked to my pride
If you take that it comes with my life
We'll take it outside not even my toilet will let shit slide
Let alone that booky man and that whip
Don't think they're playing around with their dick
If only you see the shape of that clip
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, suck your mum you prick

[Outro]
I'm the king of the jungle no-ones fucking with tarzan, so
Fuck them
