E Yeaa
Ooh Wooooeee
Listen To What I Have To Tell Ya (Na na niiiiii)

You know we ain't cool one another
You don't deserve to decide when im gonna be a papa (Never)
However much i hate you, think im gonna sit around and watch little one suffer (NO)
I ain't gunna lie im always behind when you get on all four's
But when your belly popped out you said it was my fault, you told me, (I shoulda put something on)
You werent sayin shit wen i was gripping on ur pelvis
Now your try to act up saying that im selfish
Na na i ain't ready for no pickney i can't help it
And its too late 2 say i shud of worn a helmet
I would loved to be the perfect dad
I would love to give my kids everything i never had (str8)
All im saying is now ain't the time so if u dont wanna listen its best i just leave

Chorus
Who do you think you are i ain't gettin rid of shit
This is a part of me dont blame me, u shoulda put something on, (but im jus a man, you know how we are, i dont wanna be involved its not my fault)
Its like your only thinkin about urself, its just you you and no1 else, take responsability, you shoulda put something on, so who do you think u are i ain't getin rid of shit, we both did this, dont blame me, you shoulda put something on

Something let me tell you about something
Recongnies can't tel me nothin
Not one thing boy u got my blood pumpin
Im ragin at you, u got me so damn angry

Ur selfish and ruthless those useless excuses mean nothing 2 me
This child is a part of me, you can't begin to understand someone is living and growing inside, but your just a man, you dont understand, get outa my get outa my get outa my face my face my face

Chorus
Who do you think you are i ain't gettin rid of shit
This is a part of me dont blame me, u shoulda put something on, (but im jus a man, you know how we are, i dont wanna be involved its not my fault)
Its like your only thinkin about urself, just do you you and no1 else, just take responsability, cause you shoulda put something on, so who do you think u are i ain't getin rid of shit, we did this, dont blame me you shoulda put something on

I feel for you but u knew the deal
(you was lying wen u said u was on the pill)
I have to be real with you
I think we both know that the both of us ain't got much doe
Im afraid i can't be involved, Its jus the same old selfishnes with you
Dont pretend your understanding
Its a little too late to act confused
Cause i know what im gonna do do do do do

Chorus
Who do you think you are i ain't gettin rid of shit
This is a part of me dont blame me, u shoulda put something on, (but im jus a man, you know how we are, i dont wanna be involved its not my fault)
Its like your only thinkin about urself, just do you you and no1 else, just take responsability, cause you shoulda put something on, so who do you think u are i ain't getin rid of shit, we both did this , dont blame me you shoulda put something on
