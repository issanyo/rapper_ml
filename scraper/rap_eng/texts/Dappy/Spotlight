All my friends and family know I mean nothing but well
They always stuck by me even though I put them all through hell
See hurting you hurts me so much more
I'm burning, can't you tell?
You need to learn to love yourself before loving anyone else
And that's why more time I'm stuck in this darkness just to hide from the limelight
Wish there was still a place that I can call my home
Staring at my reflection through the cracks in the mirror
I'm no longer the man that you used to know

My blood is dripping
And my words written in stone
You can try crush me but you'll never crush my soul
Get me outta this darkness, give me back the spotlight
Cause why lie?
This is all I know

Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh
This shit's all I know
Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh
This shit's all I know

We all make mistakes, forgive me
This life this life tore me in two
Cause when I lost myself and had no hope left, your love pulled me through
Now that's a perfect combination of miscommunication
They tried to misjudge me up to now just cause I kept missing probation
And here's me trying to give you more when you've already had all of me before
Since when has it been all for one?
I swear it's meant to be one for all
Cause no one should love any one more than they love themselves
And that's why more time I'm stuck in this darkness, trying to hide from the limelight
Wish there was still a place that I can call my home
Staring at my reflection through the cracks in the mirror
I'm no longer the man that you used to know

My blood is dripping
And my words written in stone
They can try crush me but they'll never crush my soul
Get me outta this darkness, give me back the spotlight
Cause why lie? this is all I know

When you make hella money it's easy to change
I wish I never let that shit get to my brain
I was this close to losing it all cause I was a fool
Blinded by the fame, distracted by the lights
Always in the wrong, thinking that I'm right
Lost in my thoughts, feeling useless
Trying to justify my actions with excuses
That's the story of my life
That's for those who really care if I'm doing well
I have found happiness within myself
Oi, it's like all of this shit needed to happen just so I could finally come out my shell

Just get me outta this darkness, let me enjoy the limelight
Wish there was still a place that I can call my home
Staring at my reflection through the cracks in the mirror
I'm no longer the man that you used to know

My blood is dripping
And my words written in stone
They can try crush me but they'll never crush my soul
Get me outta this darkness, give me back the spotlight
Cause why lie?
This is all I know

Oh-Oh
Oh-Oh
This shit's all I know
Ooooh-Ooooh
Ooooh-Ooooh
This shit's all I know
Ooooh
