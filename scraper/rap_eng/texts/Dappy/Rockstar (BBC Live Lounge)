They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch it falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now
Well imma cut to the chase
I used to wish on a star but nowadays I need space: Satellites
See the black shades white chain, flashing lights
Never thought I could of felt this low in the high life
So I asked Phyllis its still another day in paradise
Is the heaven for the forever 27
Could it be three years till I'm jammin' with legends?
I got thousands of fans, but I don't get the obsession
There's a nice guy inside, I guess I've never met him
Cause I could buy a fast car But not even an aeroplane can seem to get me out of here
The pressure and the stress are both dying to see the end of me
And the man in the mirror is looking at me like an enemy
Whoa
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time
Naahoo
Don't let em tell you how to live your life, causee
They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch it falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now
Well imma cut to the chase
Cause I'm living like a Rockstar
I ain't afraid the good die young
Cause I be living like a rockstar
I blow up a million miles away, away, away
Ohh Ohh Ohh, Ohh Ohh Ohh, Ohh Ohh Ohh
Chicka BANG BANG
Ohh Ohh Ohh, Ohh Ohh Ohh, Ohh Ohh Ohh
Chicka BANG BANG
Mama always told that there's someone looking over me
Think she meant the guy with the camera tryna photo me
Be careful what you wish for, cause the truths a little different
If the Guardian's my angel, why's the Sun burning holes in me?
They let me loose on the public, but I didn't prepare
I get shock by a lens everytime i appear
Put a star in the room, I swear it changes the atmosphere
Cause I'm a celebrity, can someone get me out of here
Whoa
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time
Naahoo
Don't let em tell you how to live your life, causee
They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch it falls apart (oooh like everything i touch it falls apart)
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now
Well imma cut to the chase
Cause I'm living like a Rockstar (Yesss i ammm!)
I ain't afraid the good die young (woahh oh oh oh)
Cause I be living like a rockstar
I blow up a million miles away
Cause I don't care, I don't care
Take me there, take me thaere
Na na na I ain't scared, I ain't scared
Take me there
Well Imma cut to the chase cause i be living like a
You ain't a legend till your set in stone
For now your just flesh and bone
Just a likkle bruder tryna build a home
I'll be the best till my dying breath: Brian Jones
A wise girl once sung tears dry on their own
Fuck a moment of silence in my house
We shut the whole shit down for Winehouse
So I've got something to say
Take aim, pull the trigger
Cause your never going to blow me away (Awwwayyyyyy, oooh woahh)
They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch it falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now
Well imma cut to the chase
Cause I'm living like a Rockstar
I ain't afraid to die young
Cause I be living like a rockstar
I blow up a million miles away
Cause I don't care, I don't care
Take me there, take me thaere
Na na na I ain't scared, I ain't scared
Take me there
Well we can cut to the chase cause i'm living like a

Ohh Ohh Ohh, Ohh Ohh Ohh, Ohh Ohh Ohh
