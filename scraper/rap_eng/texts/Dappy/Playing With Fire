[Intro: Dappy]
Na-Na... Niii

[Verse 1: Mr Hudson, (Tulisa) & Dappy
I don't slip or trip when she ask me where I've been
(where you been)
One big smile on my face d-darling it's just you and me
(you and me)
Now I'm on some Alfie behaviour I'll call you back later
To many fish in the sea for me
But when the lights come on and what's her name is gone
I realise where I'm supposed to be

[Hook:] (tulisa)
I tried to believe every word of your sweet story
But intuition keeps telling me
Your making a fool outtameeee

[Hook: Dappy, Mr Hudson & Tulisa]
Cause I'm such a good liar
Just admit it
I never did it
Yes you did
No I didn't (did)
I'm playing with fire
Just admit it
I never did it
I know you did it
No I didn't (yes you did)
Cause I'm such a good liar
Wwwoooooeeee
I can't help myself I keep playing with fire
Wwwoooooeeee
Ha hahaha
Such a good liar

(tulisa)
Thoughts running wild through the night as I watch
You sleep (she's getting closer)
I can't help but check his text while he's passed out
Next to me (it's only a matter of time)
I'm on some CSI behaviour
Who's gonna save ya
You'll be the fool when the truth comes outttttt
But when those lights come on and what's her face
Is gone we're straight back to the same routine

[Hook:] (tulisa)
I tried to believe every word of your sweet story
But intuition keeps telling me
Your making a fool outta me

[Hook:] (dappy)
Cause I'm such a good liar
Just admit it
I never did it
Yes you did
No I didn't (did)
I'm playing with fire
Just admit it

(fazer)
Can't keep up with these lies
She do anything to try and catch me out
But I never leave no signs
In my heart we were meant to be
Guys like me we be like 2 or 3 trust
I can't help myself I love girls (what)
I get a kick out of play with fire
I get a kick out of play with fire
Playing with fire
Playing with fire
She Ain't going no where you know why?

[Hook:]
