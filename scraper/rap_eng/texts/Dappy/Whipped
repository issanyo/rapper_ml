[intro]
No one (you got me whipped oh)
No one but you
No one (no-o one)
No one but you

[Chorus]
Know these bitches come and go ooo
And no one does it quite like you-u
I love the way you let me hit it
And I'm the fucking shit so I ain't afraid to admit it
Swear to god you got me whipped oh
You got me whipped oh
If there's no two ways about it there's no point me trying to hide it
I am whipped oh
You got me whipped oh
But, keep looking back and let me hit it hit it

[verse 1]
This is how I knew you was the one
We all went out for dinner and you made certain rappers we were with wish they never come
Couple pagans try and rat me no one backed me til' you said bun dem pussy let me just put my hair up in a bun
Can't lie you was there before I ever earned that paper
Should've listened when you told me that the boy were a traitor
Let's get it straight, well I'm the daddy
I know we having drama cus a bad gal ri-ri ain't got nothing on you and mama ay
You're in charge you're in charge every week we're at the shard baby
It ain't a thing it ain't a thing if you've been maxing out my card
Believe me this shit can happen
Spending hours in paris she keep talking bout a chain with 11 different patterns
Give you the keys to my yard
But I weren't tryna give you heart
But either way I know that

[Chorus]
Know these bitches come and go ooo
And no one does it quite like you-u
I love the way you let me hit it
And I'm the fucking shit so I ain't afraid to admit it
Swear to god you got me whipped oh
You got me whipped oh
If there's no two ways about it there's no point me trying to hide it
I am whipped oh
You got me whipped oh
But, keep looking back and let me hit it hit it

No one (you got me whipped oh)
No one but you
No one (no-o one)
No one but you

[verse 2]
I don't know your mama
All I know is she don't like bacon
He don't even matter seen as you always say you hate him
Told her I'd never let go cus I know from the get go that her daddy was a pagan
Lord she ain't into rock or heavy mettle unless you chatting about the ones I am rocking out my kettle
Baby I will lick you up and down
And have you coming on a whole other level, level
Okay mmm we know you got that Ferrari poonani that go vroom vroom every time you let me stick in my car key
I can't lie I was surprised when she covered my eyes
Cus when I opened up she showed me what was under the sari for nothi-i-ng

[Chorus]
Know these bitches come and go ooo
And no one does it quite like you-u
I love the way you let me hit it
And I'm the fucking shit so I ain't afraid to admit it
Swear to god you got me whipped oh
You got me whipped oh
If there's no two ways about it there's no point me trying to hide it
I am whipped oh
You got me whipped oh
But, keep looking back and let me hit it hit it

No one (you got me whipped oh)
No one but you
No one (no-o one)
No one but you
No one (you got me whipped oh)
No one but you
No one (no-o one)
No one but you
