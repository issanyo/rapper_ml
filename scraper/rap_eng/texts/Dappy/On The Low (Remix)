[Hook: Angel]
I've been getting money on the low
Girl you should come to my house
Big face Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
Been getting money on the low
Big face Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it

[Verse 1: Angel]
I've been getting money on the low
Look at you, look at me stocking these clothes
I ain't even turned up yet, I ain't gone home
If I do I'm putting on a suit and turning up in a Cayman, driving around
Oh na na, they salute when they see, I came in surfing around
(Money on the low, m-money on the low)
I can get the honeys in the road
Look at you, look at me still in these clothes
I ain't even been to sleep yet
I've been doing late night shifts, 10 hours in a show, they all grinding it out
Oh they won't understand, when I'm in the booth and I'm high in the cloud (oh they won't understand)

[Hook: Angel]
I've been getting money on the low
Girl you should come to my house
Big faced Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
Been getting money on the low
Big faced Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
I've been getting money like a dope dealer, on the low grinding all week
Bought some new clothes upon a Tuesday, wore the same fit all week-end
Had one bitch, she brought three friends
I ain't gotta fake or gotta pretend
Great White when it comes to R&B hits
We couldn't park there, probably get a precinct
I've been counting on the Washington's
Lincoln's and the Jackson's, Franklin's  and the Benjamin's, yea
I done hear some ladies talk a little, little vanilla in em
Mix it with some cinnamon, yea
Album don't drop, I'ma still eat
Living through the hundreds, call it blue cheese

[Verse 3: Eric Bellinger]
I've been getting Grammys on the low
You be in the club singing all my shit
You ain't even know I wrote all 'em other niggas songs
I cannot blame you, who does their homework
They don't check credits any more
I don't be trippin', I just head to the bank and deposit more
I would be foolish to take al this money, take pictures and post on the 'Gram, nigga
I really do this, I don't have to prove it to you, niggas know who I am
So you can trick on them hoes if you wanna
But your cheque gon' be gone in the morning
While I'm sitting on a private beach
Just me and my girl in a private suite, nigga

[Hook: Angel & (Eric Bellinger)]
I've been getting money on the low (I've been getting)
Big faced Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it (I don't show it)
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
I've been getting money on the low
Big faced Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
(Cause I've been getting money on the low)

[Verse 4: Wretch 32]
I've been getting money on the loud
Phone on silent, ringing hittas out
Since I've been doing well, said I left her in a drought
Don't let me R. Kelly in your house
I can really take the piss with it
See, I'm the one in front of six digits
Froggy style, make a prick ribbit
Said she like a cool nigga with a big business
I got an ice bucket challenge on my wrist, innit
Gorgeous like my model chick Zara
She got the vibes but she's never been to Gaza
And she look better on a bottle than a sparkler
Renowned like Funny Tummy, yeah I got the last laugh
Ghosting, I pulled up in the Phantom
Listening to Buju Banton, I can boom bye bang em if I wanna
My woman and my clothes don't be clashing
Cuh they're both so Italian, I rock diesel by the gallon when I wanna

[Verse 5: Dappy]
I keep it 100 even when i'm down to zero
So tell your don scarface he's no Al Pacino
This ain't a movie so watch who you're watching
And that shit you're rocking
Cause I might have to rob it like De Niro
We never cut corners cause we lean on em like Ducati's
You be stuck in traffic busting swishers on the cabbies
Me I got all these foreign bitches screaming "Are you Dappy?"
Cause I be making money from London to Abu Dhabi
So what a blow, this is that straight off the bub flow
Call it cargo, fuck you and that half fro
I'm still to introduce you to the real Pablo
Said she don't love ya, I bet she'll love how fast your car goes
Let's get it right, in life you have to handle shit proper
Everything you see is all me, I would never borrow
They ain't letting me spray what I really wanna say
Cause at any stage they could drop me like Madonna
Then I'd really have to make money on the low

[Hook: Angel]
Money on the low, girl you should come to my house
Big face Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
Been getting money on the low
Big face Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
