[Verse 1]
I feel you drifting
I push and you pull away
I should of seen this coming
And now we fight over nothing, yeah
So don’t tell me I’m crazy
When more time it feels like you hate me
But when I’m on the road again I know that your there waiting

[Chorus]
So say your peace
They’ll tell you that your mad not to leave
But without you I’ll go insane, so I need you to stay with me
Stay with me

[Verse 2]
They say pressure makes diamonds
Well ain’t that crystal clear
I should never question your motives na na, why
Coz your hearts so sincere
So don’t tell me that I’m crazy
When more time you hate me
But the harder it gets the more that I’m definite that you're not a maybe

[Chorus]
So say your peace
They’ll tell you that your mad not to leave
But without you I’ll go insane, so just stay
Stay with me
I said stay here with me
Ive been sent to keep you warm
So you can always count on me, that’s for sure
I said that’s for sure

[Verse 3]
Whenever you feel like walking out of the door
Not only do you leave you keep part of my soul
Don’t make me loose my mind
Can’t get back none of this time
You wasn’t exactly easy to find
You light up my world at its darkest
Leave me or keep me, I love you regardless
I felt diminished when I crossed the limit
I thought we were finished as quick as it started
It’s hard to sleep when you’re not in my bed at night
I front but really its peak so lets get it right
Back to the times you and I were getting high
I even wanna be with you on the other side
So can you try and try stay I just can’t wash these sins away
All I can do is sit here and pray that you just..

[Chorus]
Stay with me
They’ll tell you that its mad not to leave
Cos without you I’ll go insane, beg you to stay, stay here with me
I said stay here with me
Cos I’ve been sent to keep you warm
You can always count on me
I said you can always count on me
I said you can always count on me
That’s for sure
