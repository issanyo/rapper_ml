Dappy:
Nana, niiiiiiiiiii
Everytime me and you are on the case, you never seem to let me get a word in
You tell me things like
"Imagine if you walked through the door and you see me with another man, you'd throw him through the curtain"
I understand that you're hurtin', but everywhere I go girls love flirtin'
I wanna let you know that I'm another person
I called and I called, but it kept divertin'

(Hook):
See you lied, and I cried, no how am I supposed to forgive you baby, you traitor
Tell me how many times did you think I'd stay? Aaaay, aaaay

Chorus:
You took it all away
Why did you have to do this now?
I'm feelin' so empty, there's nothing left in me to say
But you should be here right now
I feel you within me, I'm hoping you ring me one day
(whoa oh, oh oh)
You took it all away
(whoa oh, oh oh)

Tulisa:
Everytime you was with another girl, you knew it was me that you'd be hurtin'
And don't pretend you don't know what I mean, cos through your phone baby I've been searchin'
So now you know that it's curtains
You're the one that got with another person
Now look at me I'm the one that's flirtin'
And now when you call I just keep divertin'

(Hook):
See you lied, and I cried, no how am I supposed to forgive you baby, you traitor
Tell me how many times did you think I'd stay? Aaaay, aaaay

Chorus:
You took it all away

Why did you have to do this now?
I'm feelin' so empty, there's nothing left in me to say
But you should be here right now
I feel you within me, I'm hoping you ring me one day
(whoa oh, oh oh)
You took it all away
(whoa oh, oh oh)

(Fazer):
Now I know all you ever wanted was a little bit of respect
But I'm a man and you know how we get
Head in my hands, switchin' in the mirror, cos I never thought I'd be the one chasin' when we met
You never showed that you wanted me for the scrilla
Even though I know you love it when we fuck in the villa
Now you're so far away, nights feel like days
Got me stayin' awake, so alive I wanna kill her

(Bridge):
Is it so hard to understand I hate living without you?
(No one's ever made me feel this low, you're pushing in the knife so slow)
There you go, now you know, how I felt
When we were together
(You took my life and turned it upside down, if only karma didn't come back around
But I guess it's over now, it's over now, it's over now..)

Chorus:
You took it all away
Why did you have to do this now?
I'm feelin' so empty, there's nothing left in me to say
But you should be here right now
I feel you within me, I'm hoping you ring me one day
(whoa oh, oh oh)
You took it all away
(whoa oh, oh oh)
