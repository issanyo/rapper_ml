[Verse 1]
Your ex was a dog, but you knew that shit already
Now a bit of puppy fat's got you moaning 'bout your belly
Stressing about your best side, take time
And you took about a million pictures already
You far from a hoe but you dressing like a jezzy
Backing it up like a pro is gonna make me catch a semi
Semi, where did your drink go, take mine
Don't worry about the bill, we ain't gotta pay it
Now she's jumping around in her bare foot, these bitches can't test her
You got that recipe that make me wan' undress ya
So here, we have to stay here all night
Cause rocking out of here with you would be my pleasure

[Hook]
It's a good sign
You're sending chills down my spine
But me no want a kiss from your lips or a taste of ya
Cake, unless it's all mine
And fuck your ex, he's whack
Tonight he's gonna wish he never did you like that
You can put it on your Twitter, on your Insta'
Either way, he's gonna miss ya
Now throw that right back
This ain't a crime
Turn down the lights
But me no want a kiss from your lips or a taste of ya
Cake, unless it's all mine

[Verse 2]
'Cause now I see you like my best friend, would you be my best friend?
It's this young thug you're with, ain't nothing like them yes men
Miss time, too embarrassed to take my bitch to Paris
'Cause we can't even eat lavish when I take her out in the West End
But woah, that's kinda evil, don't make me blame my ego
Ay woah, drop me your number or at least write down your email
My hands are on her waistline
Who's bugging down her FaceTime
It's popping, oppers buba, you should change that shit to wasteman
You got that recipe that make me wanna undress ya
Jumping around in her bare foot, these bitches can't test her
And let me just say one thing
I swear on my life I could fuck with you forever

[Hook][x2]
It's a good sign
You're sending chills to my spine
But me no want a kiss from your lips or a taste of ya
Cake, unless it's all mine
And fuck your ex, he's whack
Tonight he's gonna wish he never did you like that
You can put it on your Twitter, on your Insta'
Either way, he's gonna miss ya
Now throw that right back
This ain't a crime
Turn down the lights
But me no want a kiss from your lips or a taste of ya
Cake, unless it's all mine

[Outro]
This ain't a crime
Turn down the lights
But me no want a kiss from your lips or a taste of ya
Cake, unless it's all mine
