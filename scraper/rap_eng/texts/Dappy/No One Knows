One day it's gonna be over
I can see the end of the tunnel, it's gettin' closer
I remember I was seven and feeling like I was older
Seeing things I shouldn't have and quickly became a grown up

All we wanted was money but we never seemed to get it
One minute remainin', there was never any credit
Here we are, ten years down the line, nothin's changed
My aim is to put my mortgage down but in my mother's name

When you're holdin' and the only thing you're lookin' forward to
Is your travel and your claimin'
There's somethin' called recession keeps messin' with your brain
When I left to see the sun 'cause here it's always fuckin' rainin'

When you're holdin' and you're dreamin'
And you can't feel what you're feelin'
When you can't give 'cause you're hurting
And it seems like nothin's working

No one knows your name
No, no one knows your name
Can't keep fighting
Something that's to change

Don't need a helping hand
Till no one understands
However this ends
Hand in hand we'll remain

I remain strong always
The only change I ever see is death strain and more pain
We can't get no jobs but regardless we're tryin' all day
Make sure you carry on going till everyone knows your name

To all the single baby mothers, it's gon' be alright
To all the men there, who be hustlin' every night
When the revolution comes and going, dressed up as a soldier
I put my arm and run and I won't sleep until it's over, let me show ya

When you're holdin' and the only thing you're lookin' forward to
Is for someone to start blamin'
'Cause what they tell us on the news is highly entertainin'
When I left to see the sun 'cause here it's always fuckin' rainin'

When you're hopin' and you're dreamin'
And you can't feel what you're feelin'
When you can't give 'cause you're hurting
And it seems like nothin's working

No one knows your name
No, no one knows your name
Can't keep fighting
Something that's to change

Don't need a helping hand
Till no one understands
However this ends
Hand in hand we'll remain

This is more than a dream
Though it's further then we see
I know we'll get there

I slow down, I will get weak
If I can't stand and I can't reach
Everything we need is closer than it seems

If I slow down, I will get weak
If I can't stand and I can't reach
Everything we need is closer than it seems

No one knows your name
No, no one knows your name
Can't keep fighting
Something that's to change

Don't need a helping hand
Till no one understands
However this ends
Hand in hand we'll remain
