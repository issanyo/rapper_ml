NaNa naiiii

[Verse 1: Dappy]
I ain't gunna lie you were number 1 then but
I dont feel the same no more I just want you as a friend
I'm done trying to pretend
They say good things dont last forever some day they gotta end
Matter of fact I'm doing you a favour
Had enough of fucking girls coming back to you later
I'm sick of having to delete everything in my pager
Baby I ain't Britney but I'm dropping up ya radar

She wonder why I never pick up my phone
Cuz all I'm tryin' to do is keep it on the low
I think I need to let her know
Before she find out on her own
Either way I'm gonna break her heart when I tell her go

All my people round the world if you like somebody else
How do you find the words to say its over
Ive been wanting to tell you but i dont know how to tell you
How do you find the words to tell them its over
Baby its killing me this just isnt right for me
I think i like somebody else
Haaa haa haa [x3]
Niii

I ain't gonna lie you were number one then
But it just ain't the same anymore you're out of my top 10
This ain't good for your health
If only you knew that every time I'm fucking you i think of Somebody else
I knew that one of us were gonna get hurt from the get go
I told you, I told you, I said so
I hate having to fake the feeling every time that we get low
I think its better for the both of us if we let go

She wonders why I'm never around these days
But as soon I touch base, she'll be all up in my face
It's the same old shit she never gives me any space
How do I tell her someone's taking her place

All my people round the world if you like somebody else
How do you find the words to say its over
Ive been wanting to tell you but I dont know how to tell you
How do you find the words to tell them its over
Baby its killing me this just isnt right for me
I think I like somebody else

Why should I feel guilty?
Its plain to see I ain't being myself
Is it wrong I want it from somewhere else
I been holding out for so long now why do I feel guilty?
Its plain to see I ain't being myself
Is it wrong I want it from somewhere else
I been holding out for so long

Ooohhh wwooo oohhwwoo

Can't take no more
I won't pretend another day
I think its time for me to say
Exactly how i feel
Can't take no more
I just ain't happy any more
I just keep lying to myself

How do you find the words to say that its over
I been wanting to tell you but I dont know how to tell you
How do you find the words to tell them its over
Baby it's killing me this just isnt right for me
I think I like somebody else

Why should I feel guilty?
Its plain to see I ain't being myself
Is it wrong I want it from somewhere else
I been holding out for so long
Now why do i feel guilty?
Its plain to see I ain't being myself
Is it wrong I want it from somewhere else
I been holding out for so long

Ha haaa ha haaa
Ha haaaa
Na Naniiiii
Ha Haaa Ha haaa
Ha haaaaaaaa
