[Intro: Dappy]
D.A.P’s to the Y
Na na frickin’
And this is for my dad
Uncle B

[Verse 1: Dappy]
Yeah, I don’t mean to bore, you know my name
Chill for a second, just hear my pain
If you’ve lost any loved ones you’ll feel what I’m sayin'
I hope it's peaceful, down there where they layin'
When someone you loved, who put you up from the start
Built you up and made you into who you are
Who always believed, sayin' that you’ll be a star
Then all of a sudden they just passed
He dash the reaper from on top of my wardrobe
Slap them crack rocks outta may mouth
Put me on stage in front of a crowd now
We’re pickin' up awards while he’s under the ground
My daddy this and my daddy that
Well I found mine dead on a couch in my flat
So much to say, I wish I could have said bye
The only time I’ll talk to him is when I look into the sky

[Pre-Hook: Dappy]
All I've got is these pictures of ya
And your light blue crack down Nokia
Things in my house still smell of ya
All I wanna say is that

[Hook: Dappy]
Papa if you can hear me
I regret every bad thing that I said
Please forgive me if you hear me
Never knew how much I loved ya 'til you was dead
Papa if you can hear me
If only you, knew what you went and done
Please forgive me if you hear me
See all I know is, I’m proud to be your son
Papa if you can hear me

[Verse 2: Fazer]
There ain't a way in the world it's how I thought this would end up
If it wasn’t for you B, there wouldn’t be N-Dubz
Kept us together never knowin' we’d end up
Movin' onto Mobo’s, pushin' the Benz up
You pushed and pushed when no one wanted to believe
But back then it was all a dream
It’s like you sacrificed your life
For the love of success in a life full of stress, I’m vexed cause
First they love you, second they hate you
They talked about you, when they tried to play you
Behind your back they were tryna betray you
But B, I never had a chance to repay you
For the things you done for me, put me on the right path
Kept me from steerin' left yeah we had a right laugh
But now I’m feeling like Bruce Willis
Each and everyday B, I really wanna Die Hard

[Pre-Hook: Dappy]
All I've got is these pictures of ya
And your light blue crack down Nokia
Things in my house still smell of ya
All I wanna say is that

[Hook: Dappy]
Papa if you can hear me
I regret every bad thing that I said
Please forgive me if you hear me
Never knew how much I loved ya 'til you was dead
Papa if you can hear me
If only you, knew what you went and done
Please forgive me if you hear me
See all I know is, I’m proud to be your son
Papa if you can hear me

[Verse 3: Tulisa]
I remember everything that you said
The fights and the laughter, success and disasters no
But nothing seems clearer
Than the day you were gone
You said, despite all the stress
You have to fight to the death
Cause little girl your a star
Don’t let 'em kill who you are
You see you gave me a chance
And you look where I am
You are the reason, can’t wait to see you again

[Pre-Hook: Dappy]
All I've got is these pictures of ya
And your light blue crack down Nokia
Things in my house still smell of ya
All I wanna say is that

[Hook: Dappy]
Papa if you can hear me
I regret every bad thing that I said
Please forgive me if you hear me
Never knew how much I loved ya 'til you was dead
Papa if you can hear me
If only you, knew what you went and done
Please forgive me if you hear me
See all I know is, I’m proud to be your son
Papa if you can hear me

[Outro: Dappy]
N-Dubz, Tealease, I have to say I dropped a tear when I done this shit
Like they always say, you dunno what you got until you lose it
Na na frickin'
B you know i’m gonna fulfill your wish and take care of mum’s in the yard haha
Papa if you can hear me
Please forgive me if you hear me
