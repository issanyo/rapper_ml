They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now
Well I'ma cut to the chase

I used to wish on a star but nowadays I need space: Satellites
See the black shades white chain, flashing lights
Never thought I could of felt this low in the highlights
So I asked Phyllis it's still another day in paradise
Is the heaven for the forever 27
Could it be three years til' I'm jammin' with legends?
I got thousands of fans, but I don't get the obsession
There's a nice guy inside, I guess I've never met him

'Cause I could buy a fast car But not even an aeroplane can seem to get me out of here
The pressure and the stress are both dying to see the end of me
And the man in the mirror is looking at me like an enemy

Whoa
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time
Whoa
Don't let 'em tell you how to live your life, 'cause

They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch it falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now
So I'ma cut to the chase

'Cause I'm living like a rockstar
I ain't afraid the good die young
'Cause I be living like a rockstar
I blow up a million miles away, away, away

Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Chicka BANG BANG
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Chicka BANG BANG

Mama always told me there's someone looking over me
Think she meant the guy with the camera tryna photo me
Be careful what you wish for, 'cause the truths a little different
If the Guardian's my angel, why's the Sun burning holes in me?
They let me loose on the public, but I didn't prepare
I get shocked by a lens every time I appear
Put a star in the room, I swear it changes the atmosphere
'Cause I'm a celebrity, can someone get me out of here

Whoa
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time
Whoa
Don't let 'em tell you how to live your life, 'cause

'Cause I'm living like a rockstar
I ain't afraid the good die young
'Cause I be living like a rockstar
I blow up a million miles away, away, away

'Cause I don't care, I don't care
Take me there, take me there
Na nan a I ain't scared, I ain't scared
Take me there
But I'mma cut to the chase

You ain't a legend til' your set in stone
But now your just flesh and bone
Just a little proud child bored at home
I'll be the best til' my dying breath: Brian Jones
A wise girl once sang tears dry on their own
Fuck a moment of silence in my house
We shut the whole shit down for Winehouse
You, so I've got something to say
Take aim, pull the trigger
'Cause you're never going to blow me away

They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch it falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now
So I'ma cut to the chase

'Cause I'm living like a rockstar
I ain't afraid to die young
'Cause I be living like a rockstar
I blow up a million miles away

'Cause I don't care, I don't care
Take me there, take me there
Na, na, na, I ain't scared, I ain't scared
Take me there
But I'ma cut to the chase
