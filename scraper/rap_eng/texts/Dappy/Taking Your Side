I wanna win, I wanna fight
See the hunger in my eyes
The role of a man, I’m here to provide
Putting you first and imma tell you why
I’m tired of fighting
We’re losing all sight of what made you and I
My taking my pride and I’ll put it aside
If it makes you alright
I said no, no, no, no, No more fighting
Girl I’ve done deciding, I’m taking your side
No, no, no, no, No more hiding I’m breaking the silence
By taking your side
I know we’ve had our differences
It’s time for something different
I’m down by your side, Drop the pride
No more fighting, Coz I’m done deciding
I’m taking your side
Were in the same room
But you feel alone
Without your love this house is not a home
Broken and beaten, but were not defeaten
We know where we both belong
I’m tired of fighting
We’re losing all sight of what made you and I
I’m taking my pride and I’ll put it aside
If it makes you alright
I said no, no, no, no, No more fighting
Girl I’ve done deciding, I’m taking your side
No, no, no, no, No more hiding I’m breaking the silence
By taking your side
I know we’ve had our differences
It’s time for something different
I’m down by your side, Drop the pride
No more fighting, Coz I’m done deciding
I’m taking your side

But I come with a point of view
That’s why I’m putting down the finger that I point at you
If I’m vulnerable, your miss know it all
Let’s see how long it lasts before you blow it all
Coz you love to ride the dick
Exactly how you ride my whip
Coz that shits classy
What’s mine is yours, so go ahead and smash it
Here’s the keys go ahead and crash it
Coz I’ve always had respect for you
But in the beds the only time I connect with you
Can’t lie you’ve got bars, and there always gassed
That’s why me and you will always clash
What are we meant to do?
So is this what it takes, for heaven sakes
Keep your hands on the wheel and get them out of my face
Swear down you better hit the brakes right now

No more fighting, Coz I’m done deciding
I’m taking your side…
