[Intro: Tulisa & Dappy]
Ha ha ha ha
N-Dubz N-Dubz
Na na naii, ha ha
Ha ha ha ha

[Verse 1: Dappy]
One day I had to punch up this one youth for tryna make a fool of me
In my hood there's only so many opportunities
Look, I carry a tool for my pride and my jewellery
Now I find myself stuck serving the community

[Verse 2: Fazer]
See me, I made a change, I didn't expect no fame
We came from practically nothing to thousands screaming our name
A-list, play list, even my mum's famous
I would do anything for some sources of stadium status

[Pre-Hook: Tulisa]
See the thing about life is
That it's just too short
Leave the past behind and only then you'll find
There's more to life than you first thought

[Hook: Tulisa & Dappy]
Cause I, I never ever ever ever though that it would ever get better
Cause I, I never ever ever ever though that it would ever get better
See I, I never ever ever ever though that I could face this weather
But life, it will only get better, trust me it will only get better
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Na na naii
Ha ha ha ha
Ha hey

[Verse 3: Tulisa]
Going back to when I was young
And I treated life like it would never end
But then I grew up, got a little clued up
Then N-Dubz blew up, finally on my way

[Verse 4: Dappy]
Cause if you knew where I come from
You would understand why I sing this song
It's all changa, yeah, I put my hand up
In fact it made me man up and finally make a change

[Pre-Hook: Tulisa]
See the thing about life is
That it's just too short
Leave the past behind and only then you'll find
There's more to life than you first thought

[Hook: Tulisa & Dappy]
Cause I, I never ever ever ever though that it would ever get better
Cause I, I never ever ever ever though that it would ever get better
See I, I never ever ever ever though that I could face this weather
But life, it will only get better, trust me it will only get better
Cause I, I didn't ever wanna sing this song again
Didn't ever wanna sing this song again
Didn't ever wanna sing this
Ever wanna sing this song again
And I, I don't wanna walk this road again
And I don't have to be alone again
I can hold my head high, I'm strong again
Strong again

[Verse 4: Dappy]
Money made no change, in fact, it was more pain
B's gone, who's to blame? Look at all these youths today
Rollin' round with .38's, stickin' brothers for the white gold chains like
Look I didn't mean to hurt you mate

[Verse 5: Fazer]
Back in the day, I used to roll with like 30 mates
Never had clean money, always had dirty plates
Bein' out on the grind and watchin' for like 30 days
Now we make the year's annual wage in like 30 days

[Hook: Tulisa & Dappy]
Cause I, I never ever ever ever though that it would ever get better
Cause I, I never ever ever ever though that it would ever get better
See I, I never ever ever ever though that I could face this weather
But life, it will only get better, trust me it will only get better
Cause I, I didn't ever wanna sing this song again
Didn't ever wanna sing this song again
Didn't ever wanna sing this
Ever wanna sing this song again
And I, I don't wanna walk this road again
And I don't have to be alone again
I can hold my head high, I'm strong again
Strong again
