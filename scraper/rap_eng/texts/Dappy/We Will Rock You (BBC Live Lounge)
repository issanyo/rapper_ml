Buddy, you're a boy makin' big noise
Playing on the street
Gonna be a big man some day
You got mud on your face
Big Disgrase
Kickin' your can all over the place
Singin'
We will, we will
Rock you
So we tell him
We will, we will
Rock you
I was just a little boy in a poor man cane
Sure I was a man in my eyes, down chains
I had blood in my...fists fool of plaits
Till my mom came and put me back in my place
Singing
She will, she will
Rock you
She will, she will
Rock you
We will, we will
Rock you
So we tell him
We will, we will
Rock you
We will, we will
Rock you
So we tell him
We will, we will
Rock you
I told you I can sing
So we tell him
Right here you should heard of me
Cause I`m too sick to surgery
My name is ringing bells from down it brought to Mercury
I`m not say now I`m Freddy, may my brother rest in peace
I`m not saying I`m the Queens
But stay here with me
Singing
We will, we will
Rock you
So we tell him
We will, we will
Rock you
Legendary
Yeah!
We will, we will
Rock you
So we tell him
We will, we will
Rock you
So we tell him
We will, we will
Rock you
So we tell him
We will, we will
Rock you
Yeah
So we tell him
We will, we will
Rock you!
