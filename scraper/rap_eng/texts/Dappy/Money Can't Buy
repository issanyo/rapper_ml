[Verse 1]
I sold out like a hundred shows
All I ever wanted came true so fast
First class and videos
All my dreams turned to reality

[Bridge]
But how will long will they last
Cuz I don't need to worry bout' the rent no more
I don't need to struggle like I did before
But for you but for you, I'll give it up I'll give it up

[Hook]
Ohhhhh I'm falling in, falling in love
Take my car take my wallet
Cuz there ain't nothing like it
And money ain't gon' buy it
Ohhhhh I'm falling in, falling in love
Take my house take my keys
Cuz there ain't nothing like it
And money ain't gon' buy it

[Verse 2]
In my eyes your heart
Is something that will never be replaced
Even though it's pure cold it's still invulnerable
But imma make it secure and hope it lasts

[Bridge]
So for now
You don't need to worry bout' the rent no more
You don't need to struggle like you did before
But for you but for you, I'll give it all I'll give it all

[Hook]
Ohhhhh I'm falling in, falling in love
Take my car take my wallet
Cuz there ain't nothing like it
And money ain't gon' buy it
Ohhhhh I'm falling in, falling in love
Take my house take my keys
Cuz there ain't nothing like it
And money ain't gon' buy it

[Verse 3]
So you don't need to feel nervous
Whenever my phone be out of your service
I don't do this shit intentionally
But you always think its on purpose
This happens every time that I'm leaving
I can't be late for one more meeting
I should be tryna' catch my nine o'clock flight
But instead I'm still here catching nothing but feelings
So as long as we're in night
And we can be stranded on an island
For you I've done it in all my blood
So it's only right you're always covered in diamonds
Now just take it all
Cuz I'm feeling some type of way
Take it all, till I run out of things to say
Ayyyyyyyyy eahhhhhhhhhhh

[Hook]
Ohhhhh I'm falling in, falling in love
Take my car take my wallet
Cuz there ain't nothing like it
And money ain't gon' buy it
Ohhhhh I'm falling in, falling in love
Take my house take my keys
Cuz there ain't nothing like it
And money ain't gon' buy it
