[Verse:]
You wanna see a lot of me
So I hate when I talk to my boy from pen and he
Acts like cuz' you forgotten me!
I ain't got time to shit let alone come check you blud
You know I'm her property
I got property
Right now I'm in Europe fucking up shit
More than the economy
So when you land you know I got you properly

[Chorus:]
I bring my people through it, everything I
Do
You reckon me I fuck wid' you
Ahhhaaa
If you a snitchin' little bitch and you love
Singin' to the blues
Well this song wasn't made for you
Ahhhaaa
I'm coming
I'm coming
For you
Aaaahhaa
I'm coming
I'm coming
For you

[Verse 2:]
Yo, fuck so good make a bitch wanna fight me
Wanna Rolex ring Wiley
When I was a bum, no-one really liked me
Now it's time someone went a got a new job for Tinie
I'm only playing
I'm just saying, I'mma shit so hard I'm constipated
Overworked, underrated
Now my tings poppin' off, no gun relation
Grind all day but I ain't roller blading
All eyes on moi, holla baby
No love for the ex, on that note T
Tell Kelly I've got that motivation
Look I beg, someone try find Max online and let her know I wanna smash her
From the back
If not Sarah Jane come give me brain and put them big red lips on my sack!
I'll be killin' cause I'll be getting bred
Hard doe, number 1's all day on the chart show
So fuck you and your 90 track mixtape
That's a million bars of arsehole
My flows are wrecked and it opens legs
It's fly than a motherfucking jumbo jet
What a selfish bastard, no respect
You know dapz, no regrets
I still roll through my hood and I wear my chain
Fuck a top boy Scorcher and Bashy can't do the same
Real recognised, reaaalll
How many albums have you sold today?
I ain't saying I'm Wayne not Kanye
But I'm living life on the runway
If your 9, I'll be like 'Welcome on board my brudda, say bye to gun play'
King of the jungle, hardest can be, I dare you to let your chick party with
Me
I'm Tarzan and I'm hung like a tree
Imagine if your new born pops out looking exactly like moi
Banter, but on the real tell her get her on pampers because I'll be on the
Tour bus getting pampered
I heard Simon Cowell thinks I'm a little wanker
And I'm getting on his tits like cancer
And I don't wanna start mentioning names
Where they all now? There bankrupt!
Joe Mcelderry, oh what a stand up!
Alexandra, pull your socks up!
Where you hits at? You ain't no winner!
I feel bad cause your voice is amazing but your careers getting raped by a
Mason
That shit fucking upsets me, cause it don't get me, try bring them near me
Coming round with their hands out, wanting a hand out, ahhh that's too
Political
I don't care about a Bentley, Gucci or a fendi, man's living in a
Spaceship!
You got clapped by a, bang! Your girl got mad by a bang! That smooth
Criminal
I'm a product of my environment I ain't sayin' me and you are any different
I'm just planning an early retirement
I don't mean sorry when I say I'm going Kingston
Every man's welcome to fly long distance
We be on the beach with Weed Man Winston! Winston!
Plus I'm the craziest thing out the United Kingdom

[Chorus:]
I bring my people through it, everything I
Do
You reckon me I fuck wid' you
Ahhhaaa
If you a snitchin' little bitch and you love
Singin' to the blues
Well this song wasn't made for you
Ahhhaaa

I'm coming
I'm coming
For you
Aaaahhaa
I'm coming
I'm coming
For you
[Outro:]
I ain't even going in, I'm just fucking around
They just words
You know me
I'd rather be singing my shit anyway
You got kids motherfucker
Pooomblayyy!
