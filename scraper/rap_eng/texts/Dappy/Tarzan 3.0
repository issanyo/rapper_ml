[intro 1: Dappy]
You Ain't Racist, You Got Black Friends
I Ain't Racist, I Got Black BM's

[verse 1: Dappy]
Fuck It Shout Out To All My Nigga's I Slopped In The Slammer
I Was Singin' And Rappin' Before Drizzie
I Was The Boy In The Corner Before Dizzie
I Got 2 Packs Of That Loud With Me And The Drivers Cool So Imma Light Up A Biggie
Fuck It Let's All Get Done For Speeding
140 Bpm's Cheating
True Say Drake Blew Up Grime The Other Night
Watch How I Give This Tempo A Beating
Fling Me The Keys To My Bike
Who Wants To Come For The Ride
I Was In Croydon Just The Other Day
Boys Mum Was Cooking Up A Storm
Everything Was Bless Try Stepping Outside
You Know What It's Like
True Say I'm Bait
Man Wanna Try It
I Was On The Estate
I Wish I Had A Yank
Fuck That, I Be Going South For My Life
When Im In North, Everything Bless
When I'm In West, Im A Guest
Fuck What You've Been Through
Stop Messing, Look At This Western
This Ain't Something That You Wanna Get In2
Swear To God, Ask Bizzie And Hypes
When I'm In East I'm Nice
When We Were At The Bar, Me And Man Dropped The Strap
In Front Of His Auntie And She Was Like Jesus Christ!

[chorus: Dappy, Unknown]
Oi Dapps What You Doin' Thought You Were Dead
Who Me? I've Been Here Getting Head New Bitches In My Bed Every Night Nuttin' Less
Cool [unaudable]... But Hurry Up
I've Been Watching These New Youtes On Youtube And I Don't Care What Anybody Said There's Nothing They Can Do You You're The Best

[verse 2: Dappy]
When Ever They're Struggling To Pay The Bills
Sending For Me Will You Do A Favor Still
But I Ain't Tryna Write A Whole Diss Track
One Tweet Bet I Could Get Fascio A Major Deal
But If You Violate And I Mean Violate
I Ain't Gunna Write Nothin' Back For Ya'
Act Like Nothin Happen' I See You On The Road Squash It And Chat To Ya'
I'll Batter Ya'
And If You Put Me On My Bum I'll Come Back For Ya'
Let The Whole Ends Know It's Gunna Be Mad For Ya'
I'm A Good Fella' But I'll Have Man Sittin' Outside Your House For Days Like The Mafia
I Can Tell You How Your Mum Looks Right Now
Little Bro's In His Room Playing On Cod
Sisters Out the front Playing With The Cat
So If I Were You I'd Head Back Right Now
Spin The Whip Back Round It's Gunna Go Down
Come With Every Man You Know
When They See The 44' Hanging Out The 4 Door
All They'll Remember Is Vaffanculo
You Can't Fuck With My Costga'
Can't You Tell By My Posture I Ain't No Popstar
We've Been Doin' Our Thing Way Before The Tarzan Thing
Call Me Young Cosa Nostra
