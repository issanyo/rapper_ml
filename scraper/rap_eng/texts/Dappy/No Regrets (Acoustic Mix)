Hear me out
This is my king's speech
I'm nowhere near the end
If I s-s-s-stutter
Sorry I ain't heaven sent
I messed my life up, and yeah, I've been down
I'm a changed man now - Chris Brown
You know I feel your pain 'cause I done been through it
I'm Kurt Cobain, but I just couldn't do it
No point in turning back, just to hit rewind
Back to the future, Ma-Marty McFly
Deep inside there's a fire
'Cause I'm no longer looking at a reflection that I admire
I paint a picture of a fighter
But that someone looking back at me says I'm a liar
If I should die before I wake
The least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith
'Cause when I look in a mirror, I don't even recognize myself
I've got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No regrets, no regrets
No point in crying over yesterday, ay
No regrets, no regrets
'Cause we ain't even seen the best of days
This is my last chance, I'm on my final straw
I came so close to b-b-breaking like a spinal cord
I came from nothing
Some kid in Camden
Now I'm flier than the birds - Richard Branson
I'm a prince and, yes, I will get the crown
Kate stays in my dungeon when her sister's round
So please forgive me if I make mistakes
But I'll blow the bloody doors off - Michael Caine
If I should die before I wake
The least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith
'Cause when I look in a mirror
I don't even recognize my self
I got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No regrets, no regrets
No point in crying over yesterday, ay
No regrets, no regrets
'Cause we ain't even seen the best of days
I'm free to be whatever I
'Cause I'm famous, call me Gallager, 'cause I'm so shameless
The papers saw the pages like the cost of my failures
Victimised by the public, don't know if i can take this
So I sing
When you feel like there's no more
Nothing left but the life you've broken
No regrets, no turning back
Pick up yourself and tell 'em I'm just being me
'Cause when I look in a mirror, I don't even recognize myself
I got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No regrets, no regrets
No point in crying over yesterday, ay
No regrets, no regrets
No regrets
'Cause when I look in a mirror, I don't even recognize myself
I got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No regrets, no regrets
No point in crying over yesterday, ay
No regrets, no regrets
'Cause we ain't even seen the best of days
'Cause when I look in the mirror, I don't even recognize myself
I got the heart of winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No regrets, no regrets
No point in crying over yesterday, ay
No regrets, no regrets
'Cause we ain't even seen the best of days
