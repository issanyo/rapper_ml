Life's a bitch and then you die
If you don't care then why should I
Throwing both my hands up to the sky
I'm letting go
Right now I'm just living for the moment

Living for the moment (woah i) [x4]

From when I was younger
My pain was driven by hunger
No-one could tell my nuffin
To save me from going under
My mama cried to me told me
You should get your grave dug up the way you act in the winter
You won't be here by the summer

When my papa was alive
I'd never listen so na
If I could I'd switch places with him
To show him i miss him all the plans we discussed
In the kitchen might As well
Call me tom call him cruise
Baby we on a mission

Lies a bitch
Til you marry one
You Have a kid of two
Then You carry on
Whether you work 9-5 or you
Carry guns
You only live once
So make sure you get too have some fun

Now when we in the clubs we party like we own
Them whoever thought we couldn't make I time has come to show them
Been a struggle all my lie now the doors finally open
So right now I'm living for the motherfackin
Motherfackin moment...

Life's a bitch and then you die
If you don't care then why should I
Throwing both my hands up to the sky
I'm letting go
Right now I'm just living for the moment

Living for the moment (woah i) [x4]

Always hated life at home
Money came in slow
Getting high running Wild thought was all i'll ever know
Me and mum up in the council flat I had to save us
One bedroom for the both of us it want exactly spacious
Never had alot of doe
I mean no doe
Only little bit of cash I'd made was if I did a show
Even then i'd get booed off the stage
Collect ma doe and go

I would always try my luck but i was real unlucky though

Never met a man that didn't think with his dick
Didn't give me my own statistic
90% of all men are pricks
So from the day I was born I was stuck in the shit

That's why
Your never gunna see me cry
Cause I'm no longer in that shit
Bitch I am the shit
That's why I live for the motherfackin moment now

Life's a bitch and then you die
If you don't care then why should I
Throwing both my hands up to the sky
I'm letting go
Right now I'm just living for the moment

Living for the moment (woah i) [x4]

My mumzy always told me life is what you make it
I guess I never really knew would I coulda had till I made it
Now I'm spending every penny even though they tell me save it
The same time I couldn't care less about being famous

Yeah But I put an album yearly
Because I love my fans dearly
Tell me can you people hear me?
And all you haters you can fear me
You ain't got no reason for it you should know the fearing

Fazer always made the beats
D-a-ps would rip the chorus
T would kill every verse
Then b would go and mix it for us
We was making so much nosie the labels they could not ignore us
Now we in the meetings guess who's giving out the orders

I reminisce on days when I was barely coping
I'm 23 now, look at how I'm rolling
Been a struggle all my life but now the door is open
So right now i'm living for the motherfackin motherfackin moment

Life's a bitch and then you die
If you don't care then why should I
Throwing both my hands up to the sky
I'm letting go
Right now I'm just living for the moment

Living for the moment (woah i) [x4]
