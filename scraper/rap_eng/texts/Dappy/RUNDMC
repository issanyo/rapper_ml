[Hook]
Ballin' from a juvie
Always pitching with the Goonies
And now been in the field like Rooney
And that's why the whole of Man City salute me
The other side go and get grilled like Haloumi
Watch how I turn a ride door down to a groupie
What's new G? Come on then shoot me
Bring machine gun Kelly and Susi
And run DMC down with the uzi
Run DMC down with the uzi
Run DMC down with the uzi
Run DMC down with a
I'm a wild boy, I'll take you out boy
None of these cowboys can do me
Oi, oi, run DMC down with an uzi
Run DMC down with a

[Verse 1]
With my first Rollie, I caught lit up my whole place
And then I though watch wait 'til I get the gold face
You can't come to the crib unless you come with a crip
I got the new ting and I got the whole shape
When everyone went out to eat
I went and got 'em a whole cake
Bruh I've always done it my own way
So if you run up in my crib with a yankoy chick
What k r my rastaclat homebase
Whoever said he can't have it all mate, eh
Marble on every floorway, eh
Security in every doorway, eh
And he stand here all day, yay
The lines bait, I'll call you back
Tell DC we want much more than that
Cause a 9 bar just ain't never enough
Bring 72 Z's in a landry bag

[Verse 2]
Tonight there's a turn up and you're all invited
My neighbour's a madman, he gets too excited
If he loves the jezzys as much as his wife
Watch me put him on Insta and ruin his life
Look I know that I should't brag
Cause most man would lick a man down for the life that we have
The house on the hill and the horse on the fields
Let's see how many bitches can get on the back
This ain't a game, this is the life
Let's see how many hoes we can fuck in a night
I spray the facts, ain't that hard to see
That there is no one out there that is harder than moi
DAP, still trying to swerve that VAT
And I got the tax man on me like CID
Got me wearing plain clothes in the main road
Even when I'm in the VIP
