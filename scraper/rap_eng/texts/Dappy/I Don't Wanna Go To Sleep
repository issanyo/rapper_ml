HaHa
Tonights gonna be a next ting
I swear down it's gonna be a mad one
If you feel like you deserve a night off come with DAP's
Cause it's gonna be a mad one
Belive were gonna have some mad fun
Shh... One more thing many thanx to the fans cause we just went platnium

[Chorus:]
I don't wanan go to sleep I just wanna stay awake, get off my face
Come we'll have a couple more all dese people keep on buyin and I'm feeling like I'm flying I ain't thinkin bout the door

[Dappy:]
Yo Yo I'm feeling like a king head spinnin No more straight whisky on the rocks can't stop spinnin
Mans boggin at me like he's tripin jus cause his girl sed to him yhit is him
Why you insecure for no more need to hog (no need)
I don't want her
Watch out for my dogs though cause they will holla
So suffer for the rest of the night tryin to watch her I'm a free man why do you both?
After this club finished were goiin to freemore whos gonna be the lucky one to sit on my see-saw
Paid mums bills I'm just tryin to take a break I don't wanna go to sleep I just wanna stay awake

I swear I think I owe this night to my self, me and my friends
What more can I ask for. so grab a drink and follow meee

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to sleep (to sleep)
I just wanna stay awake (stay awake)
Get off my face
Come we'll have a couple more
All these keep on buyin and I'm feelin like I'm flyin
I ain't thinkin bout the door
I don't want to go to sleep (to sleep)
I just wanna stay awake (stay awake)
Get off my face
Come we'll have a couple more
All these peope keep on buying and I'm feeling like I'm flying
I ain't thinkin bout the door

Watch me shine I'm a star
Step into the club like they no who we are drink a few
That's my cue to take over this place
Spotlights on my face
All the boys want to taste so they can take a look but don't touch (don't touch)
Ladys watch don't hate don't hate
I come to get smashed:
I don't wanna go to sleep I just wanna stay awake
I swear I think I owe this night to my self, me and my friends

What more can I ask for. so grab a drink and follow meee

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna go to sleep (to sleep)
I just wanna stay awake (stay awake)
Get off my face
Come we'll have a couple more
All these keep on buyin and I'm feelin like I'm flyin
I ain't thinkin bout the door
I don't want to go to sleep (to sleep)
I just wanna stay awake (stay awake)
Get off my face
Come we'll have a couple more
All these peope keep on buying and I'm feeling like I'm flying
I ain't thinkin bout the door

See me I keep I keep staring at my drink
Like I wanna down more but that will send me to sleep what I need need is someone to come
And be a freak that will play with all parts of my body
So much cash money lick lick (lick me like a lollie) pop as long as you don't want anything else from me (straight)
I sweari owe this night to myself My CD's going nuts these ain't any on the shelf

I'm feeling good baby I like how I should baby

Young fresh smells like sucess raise your glass for a toast see!

Just sold 300.000 records so I'm feeling over the moon

And I know where I come from therefor I'm grateful bring anover round to the table
Oooh

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna go to sleep (to sleep)
I just wanna stay awake (stay awake)
Get off my face
Come we'll have a couple more
All these keep on buyin and I'm feelin like I'm flyin
I ain't thinkin bout the door
I don't want to go to sleep (to sleep)
I just wanna stay awake (stay awake)
Get off my face
Come we'll have a couple more
All these peope keep on buying and I'm feeling like I'm flying
I ain't thinkin bout the door
