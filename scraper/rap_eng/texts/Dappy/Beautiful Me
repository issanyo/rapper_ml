[Verse 1]
You say you wanna love me, you say I'm just a fake
You say I'm just another one that never had your back
Do you feel my presence? Maybe I should go
Maybe I'm another that you need to let go
See one day if you let me I will try and mend this broken past
Yeah, my heart will save us cause I am never giving up on us

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you love me you shouldn't care if I've made mistakes
Cause if you need me you should have never pushed me away

[Chorus]
It's like you've been waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you'll never see
Cause I see
The beautiful me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya

[Verse 2]
They say that I'm a liar cause I'm from an estate
But what you say behind my back you know I'll say it your face
I wish we could let bygones be bygones and so on and fire on
For you I swear I'll catch another case

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you love me you shouldn't care if I've made mistakes
Cause if you need me you should have never pushed me away

[Chorus]
It's like you've been waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you'll never see
Cause I see
The beautiful me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya

[Verse 3]
I weren't brought up round money so I didn't know how to treat it
I helped everyone round me and spent it all just when I needed it
I made a mil' and splashed it, did it all again
This time round, can't even trust myself, let alone my friends
If I'm the man why they don't play me no more?
That can't be fair right?
Just don't get it cause I'm on their side
I wish they wore these Nikes, took a hike to see what it's like in my spare time
And then come back and tell me that I deserve to lose all my air time

[Chorus]
It's like you've been waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you'll never see
Cause I see
The beautiful me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya

[Chorus]
It's like you've been waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you'll never see
Cause I see
The beautiful me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
