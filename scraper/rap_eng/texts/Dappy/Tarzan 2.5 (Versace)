[Verse:]
Yup! Versace Versace, I’ll lick down a hater cause I ain’t Gianni
If my kids want a bike well it’s only right I bring back a Ferrari
I bet, you didn’t know that the 20 gold chains ‘round my neck
I could swap 'em for property (I swapped that shit)
Cause when you skip jail and splash money in Mayfair, that’s real life Monopoly
If you think your baby mama’s a bitch, think again mine’s a monstrosity
Well she’s only pissed I treat all of my bitches equally, call it democracy
All of these hoes think because they cook and clean for me they can just climb up on top of me
Bitch my dick is a ticket so because of that I’d rather you swallow the lottery
