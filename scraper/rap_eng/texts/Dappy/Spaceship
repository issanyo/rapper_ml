[Intro]
TLStryds, N-Dubz, (na, na)

[Verse 1]
(Tinchy Stryder)
Yo, I got one or two on my list let me tick 'em off
Rochelle from The Saturdays, Pixie Lott
Who would've thought I would have got this far
Like how on Earth did his name brand get that large
Cause I'm a fucking star
Have you seen my car?
Holly Willoughby you can come around my bar
I want it all, no minimal
Tinchy, the General
Me and my Brother D A Ps that's clinical (clinical)
Oh, I was raised a survivor
Now I'm getting bags of money, if I get a fiver
Riding my time, so I'm living
[?] that I was given, lifer

[Chorus]
(Dappy & **Tinchy Stryder**)
**You've always been my undercover lover
Nothing like no other
Told me to get em all, fuck em all don't bother
My Nana and ma Poppa
From pounds to the dollar
Negative to positive no longer will I suffer**
My Momma thought I wouldn't make it
But now she's living in a spaceship
She said "Son, I'm getting older"
Told her money buys everything
Would you like a face lift?
See, I ain't even know I would be able to afford all of these clothes
Look at where we are
Now that's what happens when you make it
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, nananana

[Verse 2]
(Tinchy Stryder & *Dappy*)
Yeah I'm the shit round here
Used to chill up on the block
Where they pissed on stairs
I was always tryna get a little kiss off her
Now she's screaming, begging me crip my hair
(Uh) Ever since I made it
(Uh) Vision never faded
(Uh) Next to my right hand man, Dirt David
(Eh) He was like Tinch, maintain it
Better keep shit running never get constipated (Uh)
Money ain't a thing, forever doubling
*But without the fans I wouldn't have anything*
Screaming Stryds forever loving him
And I ain't ever bought a ring

[Chorus]
(Dappy & *Tinchy Stryder*)
*You've always been my undercover lover
Nothing like no other
Told me to get em all, fuck em all don't bother (don't bother)
My nana and ma poppa
From pounds to the dollar
Negative to positive* no longer will I suffer
My Momma thought I wouldn't make it (Woah)
But now she's living in a spaceship (Yeah)
She said "Son, I'm getting older"
Told her money buys everything
Would you like a face lift?
See, I ain't even know I would be able to afford all of these clothes
Look at where we are (look at where we are!)
Now that's what happens when you make it

[Bridge]
(Dappy & *Tinchy Stryder*)
Yo, I used to think, when I was this poor
And now I can have anything I used to wish for
If I lost it all to something, I would have to cry for
(Woah) Furthermore, I'd have to die for (woah)
Yo, I used to think, when I was this poor (yeah)
And now I can have anything I used to wish for
If I lost it all to something, I would have to cry for
(Woah) Well this is something I would die for (woah)
*Me, I play the keyhole, following the plans
Fresh from the Motherland
See I do it for the seating I do it for the stands
Now let me see your hands
Let me introduce you to the band
And I'm the main man
Building up my following, hold it with fans
Believe I really can, now I'm looking for my number one fan like stanner*
(Tinchy Stryder, **Dappy** & *Tulisa (N-Dubz)* ***both***)
**If only I could tell you** ***how much you changed my life***
See I do it for the seating I do it for the stands
Now let me see your hands
**I couldn't have done this without**
***all of you here tonight***

(Dappy & *Tinchy Stryder*)
*See I do it for the seating I do it for the stands*
Now let me see your hands
My Momma thought I wouldn't make it (Woah)
But now she's living in a spaceship (Yeah)
She said "Son, I'm getting older"
Told her money buys everything
Would you like a face lift?
See, I ain't even know (hey!)
I would be able to afford all of these clothes (I never knew)
Look at where we are (look at where we are)
Now that's what happens when you make it
Yo, I used to think when I was this poor (this poor!)
And now I can anything I used to wish for
If I lost it all to something I would have to cry for (yea)
(Woah) Furthermore, I would have to die for
I used to think when I was this poor (yes, I did)
And now I can have anything I used to wish for
If I lost it all to something I would have to cry for
(Woah) Well this is something I would die for
