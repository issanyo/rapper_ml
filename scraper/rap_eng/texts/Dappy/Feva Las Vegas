[Intro: Dappy]
It's N-Dubz, N-Dubz, what?
Yeah, it's N-Dubz, N-Dubz
Na, na, naii
It's N-Dubz, N-Dubz, what?

[Hook: Dappy]
I, I should have knew this from the start that if we blow all these people
The so called friends who I ain't spoken to in years
Now, they got the nerve to call me up and waste my time
I don't need you for nothing so come the fuck up of my life

[Verse 1: Dappy]
Yo, I live my life on stages, Feva Las Vegas
Sylvester Stallonin' it, any chick I'm boning it
I'm entrepreneurin' it, we do this all ourselves
From the productions to videos and everything else
See the buzz that we created was rare
Two independent releases from "Better Not" to "I Swear"
But I presume it's the tune with the chair that caused the havoc
Got all of these labels talking 'bout who the first to grab it
About man tryna buy my publishing for only 80 grand
I might look like a boy, but I got a mind of a man, straight
See the fuck game gives you a false high
When you think you're speaking to me mate you're fuckin' screamin' in my eye

[Pre-Hook: Tulisa]
Success causes jealousy
It can turn your best friend into your enemy
All I know, I believe in what I do, I can live without you
You motherfuckers are tryna suck me dry

[Hook: Dappy]
I, I should have knew this from the start that if we blow all these people
The so called friends who I ain't spoken to in years
Now, they got the nerve to call me up and waste my time
I don't need you for nothing so come the fuck up of my life

[Verse 2: Fazer]
I ain't lookin' to be another one hit wonder
Have one track in the charts, but then the fame don't last
Now we lookin' to sell units
So when you hear Pussy Cat Dolls and G-Unit, you will say give N-Dubz music
Been performin' on stages ever since we were 13
There ain't no one gon' tell us that we ain't put the work in
Now I'm keen, bustin' my balls, talkin' like a fiend for this dream
N-Dubz is my team, we weren't an overnight thing
From PC's overloadin' to problems that we couldn't solve 'em
One day before our mix was due, there's no goin' home
In twenty four hours in the studs eating microwave foods
Gettin' pranks off these dudes, I can't be asked for these youths

[Pre-Hook: Tulisa]
Success causes jealousy
It can turn your best friend into your enemy
All I know, I believe in what I do, I can live without you
You motherfuckers are tryna suck me dry

[Hook: Dappy]
I, I should have knew this from the start that if we blow all these people
The so called friends who I ain't spoken to in years
Now, they got the nerve to call me up and waste my time
I don't need you for nothing so come the fuck up of my life

[Verse 3: Tulisa]
Let's take a look at the situation at my life, where it's gone, now everybody wants a piece of me
Tryin' to claim a right to the person I've become
That so good perfect image that you see on your TV screen
That discusses the real T, that messed up shit you didn't see
And as for all the men who want a piece of the pie
You really think I don't know all the reasons I'm on your mind
It takes more than cheap talk to win my heart
So tell me where the hell were you before all this shit locked up?

[Hook: Dappy]
I, I should have knew this from the start that if we blow all these people
The so called friends who I ain't spoken to in years
Now, they got the nerve to call me up and waste my time
I don't need you for nothing so come the fuck up of my life
I, I should have knew this from the start that if we blow all these people
The so called friends who I ain't spoken to in years
Now, they got the nerve to call me up and waste my time
I don't need you for nothing so come the fuck up of my life

[Outro: Dappy & Tulisa]
Oh, it's N-Dubz, N-Dubz, what?
Yeah, it's N-Dubz, N-Dubz
Na, na, naii
It's N-Dubz, N-Dubz, what?
2007
Are you maders for realis?
DAP's to the Y, Tulisa and Faze
