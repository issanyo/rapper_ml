[Hook: Dappy]
I don't mean to be pushy, pushy
I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece?
Got time for everyone, I ain't on no leash
Be single and mingle around
Seen one too many get tied down
That shit right there is pricey
I ain't got no wifey
I don't mean to be pushy, pushy
I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece?
Got time for everyone, I ain't on no leash
Be single and mingle around
Seen one too many get tied down

(Are you set? Back up, let me get that)

[Verse: Dappy]
Do you ever get horny off readin' a text?
You ever had sex over the Internet?
Webcam and shit, wet up your tushy
Cut the story, shot play with your pussy
All lovers, put the plug in the socket like Bobby and Suzie
Wet up the place like a hot jacuzzi
I might come across sweet, really I'm a rudie
Ever since I started puberty
I was lookin' in magazines just to see the nudity
Truthfully, yes I don't care who you be, be
I'm fine if you take a chick's virginity
Lookin' at your phone becomes a misery
Cause she calls you up more times than infinity
Bitch, let me be, I don't need no stress
I'd rather have a pint and a little of cess
What you think I am? I ain't buyin' you a dress
That's candy floss and I ain't here to impress
Straight, sex no text, root it then boot it
Shag that back, fuck all the kissin' and cuddlin'
Why don't you grab my balls and try jugglin'?
Josh slept with Bianca
Little did she know he was wanker
Cause he was a bi-sexual prick
He love slits as well as dicks
He fucked Bianca as hard as Rick
Never thinkin' of takin' a trip, to the clinic
Now they're all in it, they might have AIDS
I can't have babes
At the end of the day
Josh should've put on his hood before the rain
You know what I'm sayin', anyway washin' in
Remember me, hey you know how I like it darlin'
Sex no text, root it then boot it
Shag that back, fuck all the kissin' and cuddlin'
Why don't you put my knob in your mouth and try swallowin'?
Sex is a crazy thing
Especially if you do it with someone that you don't know
There's nothin' wrong with a one night stand
Just watch your possession if she's a hoe though
If you only knew what some females have put me through
Last week, I got chased by a beast
Lickin' her lips like I'm some feast
I was drunk, my eyes were red
I'm kinda known so I wanted some head
Somehow we ended up in a bed
Little did I know she had dreads on her legs
And a wig on her head
I ain't gonna lie, I was scared
Bit fat mama came all prepared
About which color condom would I like
Get the fuck off me, woo

[Hook: Dappy]
I don't mean to be pushy, pushy
I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece?
Got time for everyone, I ain't on no leash
Be single and mingle around
Seen one too many get tied down
That shit right there is pricey
I ain't got no wifey
I don't mean to be pushy, pushy
I'm just in it for the pussy, pussy
Who wants to come get a pie of the piece?
Got time for everyone, I ain't on no leash
Be single and mingle around
Seen one too many get tied down

(Thanks for your time, now go and never come back)
