No brush, hold me back
Hold who back, dig in the back
Who are you, though? Waste man

But who are you really?
Don't watch who I am
Don't watch who he is
I wanna know who he is
I swear that's the youth with the glasses
There's no sun, son, allow the glasses
(Leave the attitude)
But I'm mad at you
(Then try and calm it down)
You need to calm it down
(Let's do this to music, make money, we're stars)
So let's come to our senses, true honesty
In couple of years, we can have our own property
(Know about your ego truths, you never get nowhere like this
Boys, you need to relax, you know
Together we stand, divided we part)

Oi, so what you sayin'?
What you sayin'?
Do we sound that bad?
What? No, you're just a little bit mad
So what you're sayin', you wanna make a track?
Let's make movements, we could be a nuisance
To the scene we could sell untold units
Let's stop being stupid, come let's do this
Don't knock the door, let's fly kick through this
Anyway, anyhow
Yes, I'm ready now
Solo tell 'em how
Let's make cheddar now
Anyhow, anywhere
Bass got mini bear
Tear down any raves
