[Intro]
All or nothing
(Oh)
All or nothing

[Verse 1: Dappy]
Show me a hand, got a plan know a way where we can double up
Done it before, this ain't another case of beginners luck
Lost bad soul, I knew I had to have another go
Now I'm on fire, but I ain't gonna' stop, drop and roll roll
Roll the dice, 'til we ain't gonna' leave with nothin'
Today's another lucky day and I ain't even bluffin'
My winning streaks never felt so strong from wrong, (you can blame it all on me)
Lets go all in, go all in and throw the whole lot on the line
Steaks couldn't be higher and only a liar would say they're happy with second place
Lets go all in, go all in, lets spin the wheel and roll the dice
Baby, because we're on fire and if this ends in tears, then you can let them fall on me
Cause I want it all, nothing in this world's impossible
See, I've never had anything, so now I just want it all
And something deep inside makes me want more, see I will do anything just to have everything (oh)

[Hook: Dappy]
All or nothing
See, I've never had anything now I just want it all
All or nothing
See, I will do anything just to have everything
(Oh)

[Verse 2: Dappy]
Oh, I think there's something in me, because me and lady luck got so much history
Alakazam, I'mma turn pennies to fifties
And I'll make shit spin like I'm flying a frisbee
If you're with me you should let me know, cause you'll be sorry if you let me go
If you don't try, you'll never know
My winning streaks never felt so strong from wrong, and you can blame it all on me
So legs go all in, go all in, lets throw the whole lot on the line
The steaks couldn't be higher and only a liar would say they're happy with second place
Lets go all in, go all in and spin the wheel and roll the dice
Baby, because we're on fire and if this ends in tears, then you can let them fall on me
Cause I want it all, (I want it all), nothing in this worlds impossible (impossible)
See, I've never had anything so now I just want it all
And something deep inside makes me want more, see I will do anything just to have everything (oh)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dappy]
Look into my eyes, and you will see a sign
Cause too much just ain't enough
So we'll turn to gold, cause we are on a roll
I'm rebelling, rebelling, rebelling
I want it all, (I want it all)
Nothing in this worlds impossible (impossible)
See, I've never had anything so now I just want it all (I want it all)
And something deep inside makes me want more, see I will do anything just to have everything (oh)
