[Verse 1:]
Fuck it we got problems
Cuz I make these bitches love me way more than all the shit i bought them
And yeah last night I was acting filthy at my concert
But after all the stripping I left with a guilty conscience
And around and around and where the fucks my mandem
I keep waking up with women and I can't even understand em
Baring in mind I got 2 baby mama's in the manor
Have you ever seen a ratchet with a hammer

[Pre-Hook:]
So could you call me back
And leave the keys under the mat
Baby I'm not quite sure
What time that I'll be back

[Hook:]
Cuz I've been lying, I've been lying
I've been lying all week yeah
And they're relying, they're relying
They're relying on me yeah
See my mama never raised me like that
And I bet my kids must miss me like mad
Cuz they're relying, they're relying
They're relying on me yeah

[Verse 2:]
Fuck it lately I've been moving sideways
And bae I must of fell asleep cuz I'm a lightweight
Chat shit, blah blah blah blah
You was last seen at like 4am on friday yay
Why you always acting irrate
Honey I been busy making muller flying up and down the highways
We don't need all this
Call me just be civilised for Christ sake

[Pre-Hook:]
So can you call me back
And leave the keys under the mat
Baby I'm not quite sure
What time that I'll be back

[Hook:]
Cuz I've been lying, I've been lying
I've been lying all week yeah
And they're relying, they're relying
They're relying on me yeah
See my mama never raised me like that
And I bet my kids must miss me like mad
Cuz they're relying, they're relying
They're relying on me yeah

[Bridge:]
