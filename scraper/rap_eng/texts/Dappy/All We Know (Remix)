[Intro]
I’m with the guys, I’m with the guys
I’m with the guys, I’m with the guys

[Chorus]
I’m with the guys, I’m with the guys
Shout out to bros, let’s get that dough (Let’s get it), that’s all we know
She got that loud, she movin’ wild, she love the vibe
If that’s your girl (If that’s your), then that’s your L (Then that’s your), I wish you well

[Verse 1: Ambush]
Ahh, nah
That's the wrong way my brudda
She didn't wanna get saved
She just wanna get paid my brudda (She just wanna get paid)
And the fate don't last and the time will tell my brudda (You'll see, you'll see)
Never sold out shows in the same cities, how I sit in cells my brudda, hey
I've been the guy, I done the road
I done the hoes, I went to jail
She took my dough
I took that L
I needed that, look at me now
All these bitches come and go that’s why I roll with the...

[Chorus]
Roll with the guys (Roll with the guys), I’m with the guys
Shout out to bros, let’s get that dough, that’s all we know
She got that loud, she movin’ wild, she love the vibe
If that’s your girl, then that’s your L, I wish you well

[Verse 2: Asco]
I'm with the guys, I love my bros
And that's for life, I'll still get high
Even when I'm low
If ain't about no bankrolls
I don't wanna know
And you ain't gotta worry bro
I don't want that hoe (I don't want that hoe)
See cos all my jewelry shining, with no lights
So my diamonds hittin'
Now she all up on my Insta' liking all my pictures
When it's turn up time, she ain't tryna miss it
I don't trust these witches
Forever bro's over hoes, that’s why I roll with the...

[Chorus]
Roll with the guys (Roll with the guys), I’m with the guys
Shout out to bros, let’s get that dough, that’s all we know
She got that loud, she movin’ wild, she love the vibe
If that’s your girl, then that’s your L, I wish you well

[Verse 3: Dappy]
In other words, I'll catch you on a rebound roasting
Cos I'm a different kind of gravy
I ain't in all the likkle man boasting
I got kids, bitch, fuck you, pay me
Look a peng face can be this even
Brudda we've all been done dirty
There's times when my heart been freezing
You think I'll ever let a ting burn me?
Don't be silly, you ain't killy
Unless you were with me way before the muley baby
What the bumba, I just wanted bumper, den I'm ghost
Like I'm Patrick Swayze
She don't love, she just tryna fuck me
She just wanna get the clout and bounce
But I ain't being funny, I ain't give a monkeys
I'm just tryna put it in her mouth, ayy

[Chorus]
Roll with the guys, I’m with the guys
Shout out to bros, let’s get that dough, that’s all we know
She got that loud, she movin’ wild, she love the vibe
If that’s your girl, then that’s your L, then that’s your L boy

[Outro]
Then that’s your L boy
Then that’s your L, then that’s your L
Roll with the guys, with the
Then that’s your L boy
Then that’s your L, then that’s your L
Ayy
