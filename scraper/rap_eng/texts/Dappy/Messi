Un po pi Courvoisier me Coca Cola
Un po pi Courvoisier me Coca Cola
I be gettin' Messi out in Barcelona
Business class, bitch, Amsterdam to Londra
Sippin' on Courvoisier me Coca Cola
Un po pi Courvoisier me Coca Cola
Why are all these putos actin' like such pudanas
Scarface bitch, call me Tony Montana

[Verse 1]
Undo your seatbelts, we're up 37 thousand feet
I'm gettin' high, skyscrapin' in my Jordans
This jet got me laggin' and the cabin's givin' me fever
I don't care if we're landin', I like standin' so suck on deez nuts
Just hopped off the plane and got carried awway
I'm not far from the block, but I'm still in the state
What's the damage, tell 'em we can mange
I still spendin' money that I made on the way
So next time you fly business
Don't be watchin' what I put in my cup
If that's none of your business
On B's grave, I will slap up a witness
And take his phone, then delete all his pictures

[Verse 2]
Last night I was in the hood with my bandana
You think I give a fuck about your gang
Bitch I'm gettin' money like I robbed a bank
Bitch I'm gettin' money like I robbed a bank
What's in the backpack, no more paper flashbacks
Now it's keep the change bitch, muchos gracias
I see plenty models sendin' bottles
Everybody swimmin' in liquor
Bitch, bring some goggles eh
Send yours to Cosby when he's in any country
We not from Toronto so no Champagne Papi
I want dutty spirit mixed in the cup with syrup
You can't be Mike OD, baby 'less you kill it
