[Intro: Dappy]
Na Na Nii
Ooh Na Na now, yeah

[Verse 1: Tulisa]
Said boy I've been seeing you for quite a while and I
I need to confess, express what you do to me-ee-ee
I need to tell you about the way you've changed my life
So many beautiful nights
You're the reason you've got me staying "Oh, oh" through the night

[Pre-Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
See the thing is
I don't quite understand
What you're trying to say, straight up
Can you make it clearer?
And I just want you nearer
See everyone around me keeps on saying that
I must be blind
Well they do have a point
Shut up
All I'm trying to say is that

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you
Like to have me to yourself?
All to myself?
All to yourself
What if I was to break your heart?
Who would be dumb enough to
Lose all that I have got for you?
All to myself?
All to yourself
You've gotta finish what you start
I can give you that ..
Let me give you that ..

Na Na Nii
Ooh Na Na now, yeah

[Verse 2: Dappy]
Yo I like when you wear them material things
But I like it more when you try my hat on, with the strings
And do the impression of me when I say "Na Na Nii"
I ain't gonna lie, your mother must have done a lot
For the body and the back off and the brain that you've got
It's simple if I start, I won't stop (Never)
I mean you're so intelligent with such a high IQ
So if I ever have a baby, I'd love it to be with you

[Verse 3: Fazer]
The way she smiles at me every time she sees me, it's crazy
I'm proud to call her my lady
Like Daps' said, she the type of girl I wanna see holding my baby
And she don't get excited whenever my job pays me
But if I'm on the phone, she don't act right
So I try to keep them well away so I don't have to stop a cat fight
Can't say I never said I wasn't that type
Truly you really confuse me and that's why

[Pre-Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
I don't quite understand
What you're trying to say
Can you make it clearer?
And I just want you nearer
See everyone around me keeps on saying that
I must be blind
You must be blind, but boy you understand
Shut up
All I'm trying to say is that

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you
Like to have me to yourself?
All to myself?
All to yourself
What if I was to break your heart?
Who would be dumb enough to
Lose all that I have got for you?
All to myself?
All to yourself
You've got to finish what you start
I can give you that ..
Let me give you that ..
Na Na Nii
Ooh Na Na now

[Bridge: Dappy & Tulisa]
Like, whatever, what would a girl like you want from a rebel like me?
Got no money in the bank, just stuck in a council estate with the under 3G
Together, we're gonna be closer to the dream
Let's fly away, just you and me, so it's up to you

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you
Like to have me to yourself?
All to myself?
All to yourself
What if I was to break your heart?
Who would be dumb enough to
Lose all that I have got for you?
All to myself?
All to yourself
You've got to finish what you start
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you
Like to have me to yourself?
All to myself?
All to yourself
What if I was to break your heart?
Who would be dumb enough to
Lose all that I have got for you?
All to myself?
All to yourself
You've got to finish what you start
I can give you that ..
Let me give you that ..
Na Na Nii
Ooh Na Na now, yeah
