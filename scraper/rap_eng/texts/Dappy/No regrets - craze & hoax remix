Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-oh
Na Na Na Na Na
Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohh
Hear me out
This is my kings speech, im no where near the end
If i s-s-s-start a sorry i ain't heaven sent
I messed my life up, and yeah ive been down
Im a changed man now Chris Brown
You know i feel your pain, coz i done been through it
Im Kurt Cobain, but i just couldn't do it
No point in turning back, just to hit rewind
Back to the future, ma marty mcfly
Inside theres a fire
Coz im no longer looking at a reflection that I admire
I paint a picture of a fighter
But as im looking back at me since I'm a liar
If I should die before i wake
The least that i could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith
Cause when i look in a mirror i don't even recognize My Self
Got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No Regrets, No Regrets
No point in crying over yesterday
No Regrets, No Regrets
Cause we ain't even seen the best of days!
Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh
Na Na Na Na Na
Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh
Ihis is my last chance, im on my final straw
I came so close to b b breaking like a spinal cord
I came from nothing, some kid in camden
Now im flier than the birds Richard Branson
I'm a Prince and yes I will get the crown
Kate stays in my dungeon when her sister's round
So please forgive me, if i make mistakes
But il blow the bloody doors off michael caine
If i should die before I wake, the least that i could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith
Cause when i look in a mirror i don't even recognize My Self
Got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No Regrets, No Regrets
No point in crying over yesterday
No Regrets, No Regrets
Cause we ain't even seen the best of days!
I'm free to be whatever I
Coz im famous call me gallager coz im so shameless
The papers saw the pages like the cost of my failures
Victimised by the public dont know if I can't take this, so I sing
So when you feel like theres no more
Nothing left but the life youve broken
No regrets no turning back
Pick up yourself and tell em im just being me!
Cause when I look in a mirror I don't even recognize Myself
Got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No Regrets, No Regrets,,
No point in crying over yesterday
No Regrets, No Regrets
No Regrets!
Cause when I look in a mirror I don't even recognize Myself
Got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No Regrets, No Regrets
No point in crying over yesterday
No Regrets, No Regrets
Cause we ain't even seen the best of days!
