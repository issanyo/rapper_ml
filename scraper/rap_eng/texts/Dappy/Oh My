[Chorus: Dappy]
'Cause she the baddest from time, oh my
Should've seen the way that ting just walked by, oh my
It's the way she parked it right there
We don't need no room in Ramada, ey
'Cause when she tease me and tease I move my hands away
I could do this all night, I know you want me dumpling, don't lie

[Post-Chorus: Dappy]
I think her name was Kiana (oh my)
We were chatting and chatting, chatting away
About how her man loves giving her drama (oh my)
You the baddest of baddest up in here
It all started with a one look (one look)
Like babe, ya looks say ya can cook (can cook)
Now I'm hooked off of one jook (one jook)
There's no need to lie

[Verse 1: Dappy]
Y'all ain't right, why try fight it
If he ain't treating you nice, then baby I will
Ain't no point in lying to be honest
There's no love, without no trust
And yeah, that goes for me and you
And this ain't nothing like before
That's just me putting two and two
Let's just forget about your past
I beg you please don't get me started
If you wanna make this last
We just gotta see this through
Sometimes you have to be disrespectful
Just so they notice you
Believe me, whatever happens
You know I'ma stay true
Look I'ma ride for ya
Can't spend all my time with ya
But if you ever need a shoulder to cry on
I got two for you
See nothing can ever come between us, nah nah
I'm done with all the rest, I just want your punana
And that ain't gonna change
I need more and more every day
Fuck what anyone else has gotta say

[Chorus: Dappy]
'Cause she the baddest from time, oh my
Did you see the way that ting just walked by, oh my
It's the way she parked it right there
We gonna need that room in Ramada, ey
'Cause when she tease me and tease I move my hands away
I been waiting all night, I know you want me dumpling, don't lie

[Post-Chorus: Dappy]
I swear she had moves like Shakira (oh my)
We were chatting and chatting, chatting away
About how her man loves giving her drama (oh my)
She the baddest of baddest up in here
It all started with a one look (one look)
Like babe, ya looks say ya can cook (can cook)
Now I'm hooked off of one jook (one jook)
There's no need to lie

[Verse 2: Ay Em]
Excuse me darling
What's your name, what's your number
Brushed me off, hey wait, said excuse me darling
What's your name, what's your number
You don't wanna give that, have me saying oh my
Got me chasing and chasing, have me saying oh my
Got me running and running and I'm just saying oh my
Had me ducking and ducking and now me saying oh my
And again got me saying oh my
Got me chasing and chasing, got me chasing it all life
Got me running and running and I've been saying oh my
So next time that I call you make sure you come here on time
So fuck ya ex, yeah I know you mad at him
If I can't get ya then I get a badder ting
We can go chilling on nights in Raddisons
That ting theres she's bad

[Chorus: Dappy]
'Cause I been saying from time, oh my
Did you see the way that ting just walked by, oh my
It's the way she parked it right there
We gonna need that room in Ramada, ey
'Cause when she tease me and tease I move my hands away
I been waiting all night, I know you want me dumpling, don't lie

[Post-Chorus]
I swear she had moves like Shakira (oh my)
We were chatting and chatting, chatting away
About how her man loves giving her drama (oh my)
She the baddest of baddest up in here
It all started with a one look (one look)
Like babe, ya looks say ya can cook (can cook)
Now I'm hooked off of one jook (one jook)
There's no need to lie
