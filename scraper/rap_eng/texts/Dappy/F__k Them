[Hook: Dappy]
So know you wanna know
But where was you when I was broke?
Now I see love you've never shown
So what you think I'm dating
Oi mum, I swear we made it

Ah so fuck them
They don't go as hard as me
Who's been claiming that they're ill?
Fuck them I'm on disease
I put my money where my mouth is
They be lying through teeth
Oh and don't be mistaken, I'll still lick down a pagon

Ah so fuck them
They don't go as hard as me
I done raise the bar so high, no satellite can't find me
They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out their sleep
Piss- pissed that they're fading
Bun them they've been cremated (Ahh)
