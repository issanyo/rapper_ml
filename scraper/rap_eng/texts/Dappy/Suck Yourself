[Intro: Dappy]
I'm liking this one
Ya'
Are you listening?
Duku yourself
Na Na Naiiiii

[Verse 1: Dappy]
Yo
I remember when we used to shop crack in pairs
I had to clamp my spot under those Sainsbury's stairs
Living on our pedal bikes, we didn't fucking care
We'd always roll up on the buses, without paying the fares
If your splashing 8 bills in a [?]
And you ain't coming back with more than two bags
Motherfucker that means, you ain't got a hustlin' head (No)
So that means you'd probably do anything for a cheque (Pussy)
Who knows, talk to the feds about the rest
You can hush that beat
Cause there's never been snitches in my nest
Up to this day I still get stop and searched
And I still give the wrong name and address yes
Back then I'd be out the house by ten
And if I where to come back, my mum would never know when
Instead of doin' somethin' good with my life
I was out feelin' untouchable, tryna' rock grown men
I dunno how he's done it but my lawyer is a G for keepin' me outta pen
If it weren't for him and my paps, I'd be lookin' at a 10
We all used to shot food but it was more about who was the gulliest in the ends
Shout out to Tinchy, I was smaller than my guns
Somethings we wouldn't do and that was shot a man's mum
But I would jam up at the crack house, all night long
Seeing man O'ding on the needle and the needle and the bone
One mornin' use to come and smell mingin'
The weather was always fucked, my line never stopped ringin'
Cubba, white, brown pills, you can name me anything
There weren't nothin' we weren't slingin'
Look at me now I'm singin'
And my little son's grinnin'
Mum's gotta skits out, when she sees her new yard 'n kitchen
The C needs coachin'
Put your album out same day as us and we'll see who's roastin'

[Hook: Dappy]
Suck yourself
You don't kill
I can tell the way you talk about these fuckin' straps, that you ain't never had one still so
Recognise real
You know the deal
If ya on this ting and you ain't talkin' shit
I'ma see ya when you make a mill
When you make a mill

[Verse 2: Chip]
When ya make a mill, I'ma see ya
Respected by G's cos' I never tried to be one
But I've been around Dappy and money makers
It's football and music, we'll let the streets take us
Uh, I never lie in my bars
Artist blow and make up a part
They start liein' to the listeners, I tell em be ya'self, the real G's ain't listenin'
But nowadays everybody's bad, everybody's gotta strap and everybody bangs
And I don't give a shit if ya grinded
If ya clothes look shit, you're a tramp
I'm sick and tired of these YouTube G's
Gettin' pissed of because ya girl YouTubes me
I swear down these niggas make me sick
(Na na nai) Throw up a C
Please, Mr. Munk's all good
Ya think my hair [?] cut the way I'm good in my hood
I pass through like sho' they show love
It's an event whenever I shows up
The money it goes up, day by day
[?], pricks should never say my name
I came, from a place where it's all or nothing
So I'ma take war and lead the boys on
Lead the boys on yeah, fightin' over shit
Number 2 album, nigga I'm the shit
Ayo D.A, look now were winnin'
We use to be in the flats chillin'
Look at me now spittin'
Teeth still grinnin'
Pass through my hood
Big gully A R keep swingin'
Paid so I'm boastin'
I can burn bread
On 1 4 corner ways

[Hook w/changes]

[Verse 3: Fazer]
Yo
I was never ballin'
My trainers all had smiles on their faces they were talkin'
Always dressin' bummy in some oversized tracksuit
Runnin' round the streets where the gully is the black dudes
Robbin Niggas bare faced
I knew it wasn't fair mate
We'd lick a couple lappys
And we'd meet up at the staircase
Uncle B was the realest thing that I believed in
Didn't think 4 years down the line, I'd still be breathin'
And I ain't leavin, so

[Hook w/changes]
