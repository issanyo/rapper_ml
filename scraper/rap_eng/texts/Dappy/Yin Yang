[Verse 1]
I say you look good, then you kiss your teeth
You look me up and down as you flick your weave
Rude girl, body like the magazines
Bum looking ripe like it dropped from the apple tree
I was told I should never hit a lady
But I’ve never been a doormat
That’s the way mum raised me
Katie, Tracy they knew they couldn’t keep me
So they tried to keep my baby
Argh
See, them two were crazy
Alisha was feisty
So I found me the best of both worlds, that’s a lighty
It's mad how she excites me
The bitch turn Jet Li when she fights me
My yin and yang wifey
My certified rider, thats why I provide her
She says I only love her properly when I’m inside her
Damn right
I’m a king and my sex is on fire
So hush baby girl, be quiet
You're Cool

[Chrous]
You’re nice, you’re nice
Living in a fantasy life
Kaching! (Kaching)
Swipe (Swipe)
Ask her (Ask her)
Who’s shoes would you prefer?
Oh boy, real life (Real life)
It's real talk (Real Talk)
Calm down, I can hear them Jimmy Choo’s when you walk (You Walk)
You’re black (You're Black)
You’re white (You're White)
Best of both types, my yin and yang wife
I’m looking for Miss Ride or Die
Another billion of them, I need one by my side
Someone who’s loving me for life
I need an attitude girl that can handle my ting right

[Hook]
Ooah oh oh oh oh
Ooah oh oh oh oh
(So you say)
Ooah oh oh oh oh
Ooah oh oh oh oh
(So you say)

[Verse 2]
So you say you the one
You the one, you the one
But if my life was in danger, would you stay or would you run
Are you down? If you are
We can ride with the avalanche (What?)
She read my mind, out this world like in Avatar
Look I've got an ego way bigger than your average man (Trust)
Why should I make the effort? (Why?)
If she don’t understand (Huh?)
And yeah I make the cheddar (Cheddar)
But she wants Parmesan (Ha)
Talk trash, cut the crap, I ain't a garbage man
'Cause anything I say, find a way to turn the tables
I ain’t saying I’m a sinner or any type of angel
I’m just saying you’ll regret it if you’re ever unfaithful
It’s just you and me G, so I beg you just be grateful (Listen)
'Cause anywhere I go you know you've got an invitation
I wanna see you there, at my final destination
And you don’t need a job 'cause I could be your occupation
But you fuck around I’ll sack your ass without a resignation

[Chorus]
You’re nice, you’re nice (You're nice!)
Living in a fantasy life
Kaching! (Kaching)
Swipe (Swipe)
Ask her (Ask her)
Who’s shoes would you prefer?
Oh boy, real life (Real life)
It's real talk (Real Talk)
Calm down, I can hear them Jimmy Choo’s when you walk (When You Walk)
You’re black (You're Black)
You’re white (You're White)
Best of both types, my yin and yang wife
I’m looking for Miss Ride or Die (I'm looking for Miss Ride or Die)
Another billion of them, I need one by my side (I need one by my side)
Someone who’s loving me for life (Someone love me)
I need an attitude girl that can handle my ting right (My ting right)

[Bridge]
How do I slow this down?
When I’m already in so deep
And the position that you’re in is just right
Ooh oh oh oh oh
Look, show me you can practise what you preach
Hurry up, back it up, back it up and you’ll be gone

[Chorus]
You’re nice, you’re nice (You're nice!)
Living in a fantasy life
Kaching! (Kaching)
Swipe (Swipe)
Ask her (Ask her)
Who’s shoes would you prefer?
Oh boy, real life (Real life)
It's real talk (Real talk)
Calm down, I can hear them Jimmy Choo’s when you walk (When You Walk)
You’re black (You're Black)
You’re white (You're White)
Best of both types, my yin and yang wife
I’m looking for Miss Ride or Die (I'm Looking For Miss Ride Or Die)
Another billion of them, I need one by my side (Ooah Oh Oh Oh)
Someone who’s loving me for life (Someone love me)
I need an attitude girl that can handle my ting right (My Yin and Yang)
