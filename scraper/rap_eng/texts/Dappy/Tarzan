Ay, it's about time that I went in Hard
Fuck the singing for 16 bars
I'm going in, but I ain't go to my yard
This is written in the hood nowhere near the stars
I'm sorry if I ever robbed you in the past
From the bottom of the block
To the top of the charts
I use to save coins
Now I'm Swippin cards and
I'm in a spaceship, bun driving a car...
Fucked White, Brown and Black
I've felt knifes bats and straps
I got the runs when I swallowed them rats
Luckily I got famous and come out the trap
Now I'm bringin 4 Mobo's back to my Flat
Same place the feds try spin for crack
If they ever come back they ain't gonna find jack
All they gonna see my face on a plaque
See me I only roll with a Bitch that bags
Sayin she ain't with me juz coz I cracked
I'm always on a hype , she knows what I'm like
With a bottle she was up a soon as I smashed
If you violate you fuck with my ego
Never put your hands on my lil lord Gino
Coz I will get reckless like my brudda D-Bo
Then go and tell the judge fuck you like Cee Loo
We all wish we had cribs and porches
And it ain't just coke that gets imported
Shout to my brudda who just got deported
And to his mother who didn't know where the court is
Im spontaneous I don't care fam
I said no to the Def Jam chairman
You can't blame me they can't change me
Matter of fact fuck the sky I got bare FANS
So fallow the leader coz yes I did it
I shut down titter for 15 minutes
Most men who got famous turn pussy
But me I still jam in the ends and bill it
You haters your gyal will get banged like Cillit
It don't matter how tough your skin is
I got a little young star that will leave you all pissed
On the floor you won't know who did this
And yes I am that boy of the telly and this
Shit right here on my neck is a belly
Hit double plats before I turned 20
Im a burn like the guy who sticks in perry
So fuck going shopping coz I get free clothes
My minimum is 20 bags from a show
If you loved pass out then check the front row
I hear a lot of gun talk and it ain't no joke
Only mixtape I believe is K-Kokes
Animal on the mic but I ain't no host
I eat rappers alive human beans on toast
Turned 20 so I bought me a cartyad
Estate agent told me I can't be late
When I turned up told her chat to my briefcase
And take your shoes off my carpet mayn
Back in the school we got judged by the teacher
Whos on the panel now ..
Tulisa act like a superstar All you want real bad boy's
Sell out the O2 arena
25K if you want me on the feature
I love singin but ya know I ain't diva
Say sattin fucked on your track like nana
And save your career like a keeper
Yeeeeah.. I ain't an MC, I ain't a singer
