[Intro - Dappy]
I do my thing
Now get it in
I do my thing
Now get it in

[Verse 1 - Benny Banks]
I’m getting paper fuck a hater I’ma see you later
Old age or Lone Ranger I don’t fear a stranger
You get interrogated we be the interrogators
And I be running with the streets like by brother Beaver
Alligators that will rob you for your pair of gators
You know me I’m here to tread on every bodies trainers
I say this rap game died till I came and saved it
Got everybody on my nuts with a song that’s basic
I never let nobody carry me
Streets made a man of me rap feed my family
Slow dough is better than no dough I got it gradually
I never had a silver spoon or let nobody pamper me
Im not a star I’m a mother fucking galaxy
Catch me if you can but ain’t nobody gon be catching me
Sorry anybody if you heard ya girls banging me
Ain’t my fault she’s gassed up on a rappers dick

[Hook – Dappy]
Cause they don’t do what we do
Beenies wanna fuck I’m flyer than a seagull I’m the daddy daddy
Find me in the hood putting on all my people
Popo can suck a dick suck a dick I ain’t the one moving the kilo
I drive them bitches crazy
You ain’t having me kid but you can always drink my baby
I’m the daddy daddy
I do my thing I do my thing
I get it in
Pussy wanna chat shit Benny kill em
Bada boom bada bing

[Verse 2 - Benny Banks]
Middle finger up at your favourite rapper
Loud mouth man I’m always getting into banter
Everybody feel my presence like I come from Santa
I ain’t never stunk of BO but I stink of ganja
Ask Dappy rockstar I make em throw they hands up
He said fam you see the fans they’re singing Benny Banks songs
I know a lot of hangers on but I ain't being hanged on
Hornsey North London yea that’s where I come from
I live near the gunners I dont represent the dungeon
I get you boom bye bye but I ain’t Buju Banton
Who’d of thought I’d turn bada bing into an anthem
Most rappers easy competition man I gotta thank em
Bunch of actors acting like they gangsters
But they really wanksters just a bunch of pranksters
You should try Jackass or some Dirty Sanchez
I swing my right fist and knock out ya hamsters

[Hook - Dappy]
Cause they don’t do what we do
Beenies wanna fuck I’m flyer than a seagull I’m the daddy daddy
Find me in the hood putting on all my people
Popo can suck a dick suck a dick I ain’t the one moving the kilo
I drive them bitches crazy
You ain’t having me kid but you can always drink my baby
I’m the daddy daddy
I do my thing I do my thing

Pussy wanna chat shit benny kill em
Bada boom bada bing

[Benny Banks & Dappy]
Big smile on my face I been getting money
Call my name out ya mouth I never been a dummy

Many thanks cos we just set up a new branch

Cause they don’t do what we do

[Hook - Dappy]
Cause they don’t do what we do
Beenies wanna fuck I’m flyer than a seagull I’m the daddy daddy
