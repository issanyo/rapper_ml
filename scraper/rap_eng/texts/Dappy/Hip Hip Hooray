[Intro]
Hip hip hooray, aight, hip hip hooray
It's my type of party, hip hooray
One for love, hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray
Nana, hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray
Nayehh, hip hip hooray

[Verse 1]
They say no one's perfect
And maybe you weren't born with it
But who gives a fuck cause you're worth it
Especially when you wake up girl
Without no make up on yourself
Especially when you're being real
Hold me from your head right down to them heels
And even though they suit you, don't judge me
When I say that don't appeal

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you don't need to be rich
Covered in makeup or wrapped up in Gucc'
You know why, nothin' suits you like your birthday suit
You might look good in that new dress
And in them designer shoes, but so what
Nothin' suits you like your birthday suit

[Hook]
You blew me away, hip hip hooray
It's my type of party, hip hooray
One for love, hey
Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray
Hip hooray, I want to celebrate

[Verse 2]
But why you gonna make it so hard for me
When we could be on the same page in harmony
On that note, oh oh oh oh
Love the way you keep it real
You blew me from your head right down to them heels
And even though they suit you, don't judge me
When I say that don't appeal

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you don't need to be rich
Covered in makeup or wrapped up in Gucc'
You know why, nothin' suits you like your birthday suit
You might look good in that new dress
And in them designer shoes, but so what
Nothin' suits you like your birthday suit

[Hook]
You blew me away, you blew me away
So I'mma make your wish come true
Cause nothin' suits you like your b-b-b
And when you wear less, that's when you look best
So you ain't got nothin' to prove
You know why, nothin' suits you like your birthday suit
You blew me away, hip hooray
It's my type of party, hip hooray
One for love, hey
Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray
Hip hooray

[Bridge]
Your eyes, stay down in disguise
How many more ways can I say to you
Girl you look good just the way you are
Couldn't care less if the shades on your face ain't real
If you're ride outside worth's quarter a mill
Cause only God can judge you, so that shit just don't appeal

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you don't need to be rich
Covered in makeup or wrapped up in Gucc'
You know why
You might look good in that new dress
And in them designer shoes, but so what
Nothin' suits you like your birthday suit

[Hook]
You blew me away, you blew me away
So I'mma make your wish come true
Cause nothin' suits you like your b-b-b
And when you wear less, that's when you look bet
So you ain't got nothin' to prove
You know why, nothin' suits you like your birthday suit
You blew me away, hip hooray
It's my type of party, hip hooray
One for love, hey
Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray
Hip hooray
