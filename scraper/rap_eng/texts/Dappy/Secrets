[Intro: Tulisa]
Dappy, turn my mic up

[Verse 1: Tulisa]
Today is the day that I'm gonna tell
Just a little 'bout myself
All of these haters, they don't understand me
They can't touch the pain I've felt
I wish I could show them all of my secrets
And they might see through me
But if I tell my secrets or expose my weakness
I can let 'em tear through me
Mummy had problems, daddy couldn't solve them
Won't stop, they just add to her pain
Daddy it's okay, I still love you
Because you show me love in every way
Mummy I'm sorry for not always caring
I got so lost when you weren't around
Since I was a young girl, I kept us related
I don't trust so I won't get let down

[Hook: Tulisa & Dappy]
So who could be behind my smile?
I'm crying out and I'm left without a hand
T, no you ain't, you can tell us anything
And we'll advise you in every way
One more thing, for those who don't know we is family
We've known each other since we were babies

[Verse 2: Fazer]
So I guess it's just another one of them days
I got bills to pay, studs' to rent
Girl problems
Plus an album due within nine days
Stress to the brain
Mumsy's going through so much pain
Every time I get paid money to Elaine
One more and you'll open you eyes to a blacked out range

[Verse 3: Dappy]
Gunshots, knife attacks
Seems like I'm living in a life of attacks
Government bills, dodgy deals
Leads to another life, crime on wheels
I'm so broke that it's no joke
Surrounded by addicts who be on coke
If I really wanted to, I make money off them
Block in the morning on the move by ten
I write them hits in my head
Don't need no time with paper and pen
I sell my demos in boxes of ten
Won't stop me unless you're a dirty bill

[Verse 4: Fazer]
It's like yesterday
Fifteen hooded up thirteen years olds in Westie
Were the bester days, can you relate?
Young black boys from council estates
Rollin' around the ends twenty man strong
Pour some Hennessy for every man gone
I know I ain't sent no letters but still
Free hash, free deal, I'm not for much longer

[Pre-Hook: Dappy & Fazer & Tulisa]
Ever since I was a young'n
I found it hard to find my way
That's why
I don't trust so I won't get let down

[Hook: Tulisa & Dappy]
So who could be behind my smile?
I'm crying out and I'm left without a hand
T, no you ain't, you can tell us anything
And we'll advise you in every way
One more thing, for those who don't know we is family
We've known each other since we were babies

[Verse 5: Tulisa]
Oh I went from not wantin' to live life no more
To appreciatin' every breath I take
If it wasn't for the music, I probably wouldn't be here
That's why I pray to God everyday
Screamin' the days where I could just fly away
I'm tryna be strong but as for today, I'm feelin' down

[Hook: Tulisa]
So who could be behind my smile?
I'm crying out and I'm left without a hand
