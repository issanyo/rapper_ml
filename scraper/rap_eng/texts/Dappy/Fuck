I say you look good then you kiss your teeth
You look me up and down as you flick your weave
Rude girl body like the magazine
Bum looking ripe
Like it dropped from the apple tree
I was told I should never hit a lady
But I’ve never been a doormat
That’s the way mum raised me
Katie, Tracy they knew They couldn’t keep me
So they tried to keep my baby
Argh
Most white girls are crazy
Black girls are feisty
See me I like the best of both worlds, that’s a lighty
This mother she excites me
The bitch turned Jet Li when she fights me
My yin and yang wifey
My certified rider, thats why I provide her
She says I only love her properly when I’m inside her
Damn right
I’m a king and my sex is on fire
So hush baby girl, be quiet
You're Cool

(Chrous)
You’re nice, you’re nice
Living in a fantasy life
Kaching! (Kaching)
Swipe (Swipe)
Ask her (Ask her), who’s shoes would you prefer
Oh boy real life(Real life), It's real talk (Real Talk)
Calm down I can hear them Jimmy Choo’s when you walk (You Walk)
You’re black (You're Black), you’re white (You're White), best of both types my yin and yang wife
I’m looking for miss ride or die
I'll have a billion of them, I need one by my side
Someone who’s loving me for life
I need an attitude girl who can handle my ting right

(Hook)
Ooah oh oh oh oh
Ooah oh oh oh oh
So you say
Ooah oh oh oh oh
Ooah oh oh oh oh
So you say

(Verse 2)
So you say your the one
You the one, you the one
But if my life was in danger would you stay or would you run
Are you down if you are
We can ride through the avalanche (What?)
She blew my mind out this world like an avatar
Look I got an ego way bigger than your average man (Trust)
Why should I make the effort (why?)
If she don’t understand (Huh?)
Yeah I made the cheddar (Cheddar) but she wants parmesan (Ha)
Talk trash
Cut the crap I ain't a garbage man
Cause anything I say find a way to turn the tables
I ain’t saying I’m a sinner or any type of angel
I’m just saying you’ll regret it you’re ever unfaithful
It’s just you and me G so I beg you just be grateful (listen)
Cause anywhere I go you know you got an invitation
I wanna see you there, at my final destination
And you don’t need a job cause I could be your occupation
But you fuck around I’ll sack your ass without a resignation

(Chorus)
You’re nice, you’re nice (you're Nice!)
Living in a fantasy life
Kaching! (Kaching)

I’m looking for miss ride or die (I'm Looking For Miss Ride Or Die)
I'll have a billion of them, I need one by my side (I Need One By My Side)
Someone who’s loving me for life (Someone Whos Loving Me)
I need an attitude girl who can handle my ting right (My Ting Right)

(Hook 2)
How do I slow this down
When I’m already in so deep
And the position that you’re in’s just right
Ooh oh oh oh oh
Look show me you can practise what you preach
Hurry up back it up back it up and you’ll be gone

You’re nice, you’re nice (you're Nice!)
