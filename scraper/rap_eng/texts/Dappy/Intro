[Verse: Dappy & Fazer]
I dedicate this debut album to one man only
'Til this day I remember everything you showed me
I nearly come off the rails
If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead or in jail
I dedicate this album to him
He's the reason we did an N-Dubz
Skint
Huh, see the thing is we all started off
Broke
So now you see why we had to call this Uncle B
If you're not gonna make it
Check him
But you better put you time
You better put the time
Done eight years
Eight years
Skint
Skint
Broke
Broke
All money
All madness
Doing gigs for nothing, you know what really get me
It's freezing out there, now the phone is popping
It's changing
The phone is popping and there's some serious people on the line
I thank you
And you know it goes to show you, where there's a will, there's a way
And you know, order and out, blah blah
