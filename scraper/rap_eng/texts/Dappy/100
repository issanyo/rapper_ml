[Intro]
I keep it 100
I keep it 100 oh
You know I always keep it one hundred right?
I keep it 100
You ain't gotta worry about shhhh
I keep it 100

[Verse 1]
I thought that you’d give up
When all we had was us
I can’t even lie, even lie to ya
I'm sorry it ain't my fault
I run out of all my trust
I went through hell and back
To get it back
That’s why every day I thank the lord
You ain't just with me for money
Cos you keep on giving without taking nothing from me
I remember all the times when I was low
And you never let go
(Oh no)

[Pre-Hook]
I'm just being honest with you oh
You could be down and out
But it won’t matter
Just call for back up
And I will always come through oh oh
You don’t need nobody else
It’s me and you against the world

[Hook]
Cos I was built for this
So forget about my previous
When I say I'm being serious
I'm too real for this
I feel to run and tell everyone
As if I’ll find anyone as good as this
As good as this
You know I'm built for, for you
See I
I keep it

[Verse 2]
So the only thing that matters
Is you can always count on me
Cos you know I keep it one hundred
And I have done right from the start
This time round I won’t let you down
Cos you and I were a part of me
That’s hand on heart
So tell me if there’s anything I could do to make it better
Let me know a way I could take away any of the pressure
Now if ever you feel low
Just know that I’ll never let go
(Oh no)

[Pre-Hook]
Cos I'm just being honest with you oh
You could be down and out
But it won’t matter
Just call for back up
And I will always come through oh oh
You don’t need nobody else
It’s me and you against the world

[Hook x2]
Cos I was built for this
So forget about my previous
When I say I'm being serious
I'm too real for this
I feel to run and tell everyone
As if I’ll find anyone as good as this
As good as this
You know I'm built for, for you
See I

I was built for this

[Bridge]
Now tell me who do you love?
Even though I haven’t made it easy
You think I've come this far just to give up?
Hell no
Cos what it is
What it is
What it is
What it is

[Hook x2]
Cos I was built for this
So forget about my previous
When I say I'm being serious
I'm too real for this
I feel to run and tell everyone
As if I’ll find anyone as good as this
As good as this
You know I'm built for, for you
See I

[Outro]
I keep it 100
I keep it 100
I keep it 100
I keep it 100
