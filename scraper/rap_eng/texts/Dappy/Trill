[Intro]
Yah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Stay prayed up

[Verse 1]
Did you see how many feds were at my door, wow
Should've seen how many paps were at the courthouse
Do you know how much I have had to fork out?
Who's that fucking banging on the door now?
It's cool, let them in, it's only few of my lot from round the way
Shout out to the dawgies dem from day
Yeah they might come in a pack
But they all got my back so I'll never lead them astray
I nearly lost my boy the other week
These streets will swallow you up, it's peak
One minute he was running his mouth on his celly to me
An hour later, he could just about speak
We addicted to diamonds
We ain't scared of no sirens
We just drive past the feds twice but they're none the wiser
I'm repping for the underdogs
Yeah I'm a scumbag, watch me light up this nightclub
Donny in a Nike glove
See I ain't no gunman
But chat shit in person, you'll get the one bang
Swear down, next time it's gonna be a mad ting
That was the last time I get called a hasbeen
I mean let's be real, I've got half a mil'
To get ... by Lulu and Jasmine
My YGs do what I say so
Why you think I'm always tryna lay low
They could boot me off of them airways
But that will never dictate my payroll
We had my tunes before iTunes
Bebo before Myspace
The whole gang got some deepthroat
The first time that they ever booked my face
I never had a pot to piss in so fuck off, I'll call you later
Had enough of giving all these handouts
So get your hands out my pot of paper
No matter how much that I spend or how much scrilla I earn for my gigs
If you're my bro then you already know that you never ever have to ask for a thing
Fuck sticking to one lane, I've got ten bruv
It be a wrap when I bring back N-Dubz cuz
Whatever they say won't faze me 'cause I don't need to react, my friend does
Now that's love

[Chorus]
Oi that's love
Only thing that can buy my trust
Seems like they only wanna do us any favours when we up
That's what's up, ay what's up
You know it's nothing but love
But I ain't always gon' be there when you run out of luck
And that's trill
Not everybody ends up with a house on the hill
Believe me, I know how you feel
But for now let's just be real
Acting like you the only one out in these streets
We all got families to feed
So all I can do is be trill

[Hook]
So we come from the manor
Where's there's nothing but pasta
And that doesn't matter
'Cause when you take a L, you go get your hammer
Oi, oi, oi
Not everybody ends up with a house on the hill
So if I can help then I will
No one can tell me about being trill

[Verse 2]
I mean why are you vexed?
I told you that I would be back in a sec
Fuck that, give me an hour
You take all this money and power
But show no respect
Matter fact, what's the point us even trying
Every time we try and talk you start crying
You know you're acting silly when you say you wanna end it with me and you're lying
When really you dig me 'cause I'm a [Gassbag]
Triple hashtag
Smiley face and I'm feeling you 'cause you are body with a big ego and a tiny waist
You'll feel the love when you show me your loyalty
What do you mean what do I mean?
Please stop annoying me
Act like a queen and I'll treat you like royalty
To be fair I ain't gotta worry about a thing
I ain't gon' keep asking you where you've been
If you're a whore and you're going on raw
I'ma put you on the tour bus with the uck queen
Uh, that's what I thought, carry on acting a fool
You gassed little bruddas, back to the board
What, has cat got your tongue?
You're actually dumb?
As for the funds and everything I've done
That was all out of love

[Hook]
Oi that's love
Only thing that can buy my trust
Seems like they only wanna do us any favours when we up
That's what's up, ay what's up
You know it's nothing but love
But I ain't always gon' be there when you run out of luck
And that's trill
Not everybody ends up with a house on the hill
Believe me, I know how you feel
But for now let's just be real
Acting like you the only one out in these streets
We all got families to feed
So all I can do is be trill

[Hook]
So we come from the manor
Where's there's nothing but pasta
And that doesn't matter
'Cause when you take a L, you go get your hammer
Oi, oi, oi
Not everybody ends up with a house on the hill
So if I can help then I will
No one can tell me about being trill

[Outro]
I done lost a hella stacks
So it's only right I get it by ya
I done lost a hella, uh
