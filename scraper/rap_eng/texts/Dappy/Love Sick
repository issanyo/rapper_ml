Don't make a sound
I might be dreaming boy
So don't wake me now
Let me believe in this
One more minute
One more second now (oh)
One more smile and
One more touch and we'll go

Lust in your eyes
Yes baby
Always tangled up in your lies
It's getting harder
And i'v seen all the signs
I gotta get up and leave now

(Chorus)
Because i want what i want
And yes my heart is broken
And i'm scared but i know
Another door will open
It's only love
And though my heart is in bits
I know
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick love sick)
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick love sick)
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick love sick)
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick) love sick

There was a time
You'd look at me
And you'd reflect all that I
Trying to be and for
One sick minute
One bad second i thought
We could have it
You were all that i'd want

Lost in your hands

And yet i easily got lost in your plans
And looking back i should of notcied back then
I should of walked awaay
It doesn't matter now

(Chorus)
Because i want what i want
And yes my heart is broken
And i'm scared but i know
Another door will open
It's only love
And though my heart is in bits
I know
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick love sick)
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick love sick)
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick love sick)
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick) love sick

Don't make a sound
I might be dreaming boy
Don't make a sound..

Because i want what i want (yeaaah)
And yes my heart is broken
And i'm scared but i know ( i know)
Another door will open
It's only love (it's only love)
And though my heart is in bits
I know (i know)
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick love sick)
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick love sick)
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick love sick) (im so love sick)
Im just abit love sick, love sick (love sick) love sick

Im just abit love sick..
