[Verse 1: Dappy & Margs]
Somebody Better ring 999 if they wanna get rid of me
Call the coastguard, bring the military
I never came to pose for no photo
I ain't a statue, don't take liberties
Exclusive imports from Italy
I got swagger that's sharp like a guillotine
I see a couple good girls that are feeling me
But only bad girls get into my billie jeans
They Be loving me because I give them what they ask for
Follow me, they let me out the hard door
I hear gossip cause I'm in the heat
Anything that I'm packin needs it's own passport
Passport? I thought he was a spaceman, am only playing fam
I'm looking at short skirts, Raybans
High heels and fake tans

[Bridge]
Hows you night gone, you got a light hun
Is that your man he's a right blag
Somebodys coming home with me tonight
High heels, Fake tans

We go stumbling down the stairs I'm wavey
Hold me up
Hows your night cuz, you got a light blud
So is that your girl, she mite still
Somebody is coming home with me tonight

[Hook]
I mite do something I regret tonight, I don't care
Cause when I wake up...
I - I - I I won't remember
I won't remember a thing
If only you could stay like this for ever
Then I'll be living the dream, dream dream
(Your comin with me)
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay

[Verse 2: Dappy & Margs]
It feels like the night couldn't get any better
Feel like any girl I want, I can get her
I'm getting hot, I might take of my top
But I'll still make it rain
Better get an umbrella
What ella ella forget about your fella
Got a table full of great goose and don't please
Put your purse back in ya bag, tonights on me
Never know tomorrow you could be on page 3
Fall to the floor, feeling bad like a jagerbomb
No jetski can ride this wave I'm on
Who knows, if I wave my wand
I might turn your girl into a baby mum

So don't you wish your boyfriend had a uh like me
I'm looking at short skirts, raybans
High heels, Fake tans
We go stumbling down the stairs am wavey
Hold me up

[Bridge]
Hows ya night gone, you got a light hun
Is that man he's a right blank
Somebodies comin home with me tonight
