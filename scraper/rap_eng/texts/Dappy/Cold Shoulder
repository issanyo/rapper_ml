[Intro: Dappy]
Na Na Niiiii
(Yeah)why dont you come over
(Yeah) Warm up your cold shoulder
(Yeah) Yeah we can get crazy baby all night before we got sober

[Verse 1: Dappy]
Look at yourself
Now that ain't good for your health
If you carry on burning hot much longer the floor beneath us gon melt
Follow to me to the bar baby
Otherwise we can take it to my Mercedes
Push on my gear stick and I'll drive you crazy

[Pre-Hook: Tulisa]
Take a look at the time
Baby quit playing games cuz the suns bout ro rise
We've been here
All night
Only live once so we might as well act like this

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Why dont you come over
Warm up your cold shoulder
We can get crazy baby all night before we get sober
Wait for hangoverrs
Something for ya
Im gonna keep you up
Im gonna keep you up
Why dont you come over
Warm up your cold shoulder
We can get crazy baby all night
Before we get sober
Wait for hangovers
Something important
Im gonna keep you up tonight

[Verse 2: Fazer]
I'm all dressed in red
And I'm off my head
But I'm lookin too get ractched by feds
I'm lookin get between your legs
Let me come into your world baby
You won't be the one wearin couffs lately
We can make love or do it rough baby
However you let me do it
I'ma drive you crazy

[Pre-hook: Tulisa]
Take a look
At the time
Baby quit playin games cuz the suns bout to rise

Only live once so we might as well act like this

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]

[Bridge: Tulisa]
No more talkin lets go

Lets get tipsy
Lets get wasted
Then we'll party some more
No more talkin lets go
I just can't wait no more
Its time to hit the floor now
Im gonna give you up

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Why dont you come over

We can get crazy baby all night before we get sober
Wait for hangoverrs
Something for ya

Why dont you come over
Warm up your cold shoulder
We can get crazy baby all night
Before we get sober
