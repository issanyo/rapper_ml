[Intro: Dappy]
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh (na na naii)
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh (Tinchy Stryder)
Ah uh uh oh (N-Dubz)
Ah uh uh oh (yo)

[Verse 1: Tinchy Stryder]
It was nothing but a quick thing kids games, kiss chase, just a quick fling
Now I'm hoping you never go missing
Now I'm telling you, you can hold this ring, watch how it glistens
Thought it would be done as quick as the wind blows
Didn't think I would ever be involved
So I even wrote a song called "Don’t Go"
Now it's just you and me on a love road
We done it like D-low, us two tiptoe, duck, dive, get low
And now I care less about who knows
Now we’re deep in, way past intros, Dappy, explain though

[Hook: Dappy]
See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You’re number one
See, I don’t understand how you’re number one
When it was just a fling before, now, you’re the one
See, all I did was blink twice
From my homie to my only number one

[Verse 2: Tulisa]
I never thought I'd get here, never thought I would care
Cause I was always looking out for me
I was being selfish, I couldn't see
All that I want was right in front of me
But baby, I've changed
Cause you got me tamed
You're my number one
Now you're priority

[Hook: Dappy]
See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You’re number one
See, I don’t understand how you’re number one
When it was just a fling before, now, you’re the one
See, all I did was blink twice
From my homie to my only number one

[Bridge: Dappy]
You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
I'll never let nothing get in the way
You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
I'll never let nothing get in the way

[Middle 8: Fazer]
Trust me when I say
That I ain't ever gonna let nothing get in the way
Cause we was always cool as friends back in the day
It's funny how you changed, you've got me going insane
See, you ain't like the rest, you run in your own lane
You are number one

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You’re number one
See, I don’t understand how you’re number one
When it was just a fling before, now, you’re the one
See, all I did was blink twice
From my homie to my only number one

[Outro: Tinchy Stryder]
Number one in the race, you’re a leader
Girl, you’re out of this world, they can't see ya
And now you got a place in my heart, it's funny how you actually went
From my homie to my only number one
