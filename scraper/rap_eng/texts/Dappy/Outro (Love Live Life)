When a motherfucker tells me that his life's bad
I tell him compared to what you been Baghdad
Gaza, Basra, me and you are cool
You got a car, I got a plasma
Kids today got Nike Airs by the pile
While somewhere else in the world
For water, a likkle man's gotta walk barefoot
In the blazing heat for more than nine miles
Life could be so much harder
You got to love and live your life
In every single hood or wherever you may be
Love and live your
You see us, we're more than grateful
There's madness going on everywhere in the world right now
So we just wanna thank all our fans for putting us where we are today
Love, live your life, no, no
