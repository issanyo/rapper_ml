[Intro: Dappy]
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh (na na naii)
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh (Tinchy Stryder)
Ah uh uh oh (N-Dubz)
Ah uh uh oh (yo)

[Verse 1: Tinchy Stryder]
It was nothing but a quick thing kids games, kiss chase, just a quick fling
Now I'm hoping you never go missing
Now I'm telling you, you can hold this ring, watch how it glistens
Thought it would be done as quick as the wind blows
Didn't think I would ever be involved
So I even wrote a song called "Don’t Go"
Now it's just you and me on a love road
We done it like D-low, us two tiptoe, duck, dive, get low
And now I care less about who knows
Now we’re deep in, way past intros, Dappy, explain though

[Pre-Hook: Dappy & Tinchy Stryder]
See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You’re number one

[Hook: Dappy]
See, I don’t understand how you’re number one
When it was just a fling before, now, you’re the one
See, all I did was blink twice
From my homie to my only number one

[Verse 2: Tinchy Stryder]
Yo, it was all now, never planned no after
It was like games, jokes, laughter
Live for the moment, left it all open
Now I’m in deep, flames, lava, breathe, calmer
And now I’m stating, see I never saw this in my daydream
It's really you that I’m fully rating
And the day's here, no more waiting
Played it all wise cause a smart man raised him
I was all hurt, pain, aching
On the wrong path then a good girl saved him
That’s why I'm letting her know she’s amazing

[Pre-Hook: Dappy & Tinchy Stryder]
See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You’re number one

[Hook: Dappy]
See, I don’t understand how you’re number one
When it was just a fling before, now, you’re the one
See, all I did was blink twice
From my homie to my only number one

[Bridge: Dappy]
You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
Won't never let nothing get in the way
You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
Won't never let nothing get in the way

[Middle 8: Tinchy Stryder]
Yo, I ain't never gonna let nothing get in the way
You played your cards all right, you're an ace
You make my nights all bright, you're my days
You took me out of the maze
You are number one

[Hook: Dappy]
See, I don’t understand how you’re number one
When it was just a fling before, now, you’re the one
See, all I did was blink twice
From my homie to my only number one

[Bridge: Dappy]
You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
Won't never let nothing get in the way
You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
Won't never let nothing get in the way

[Outro: Tinchy Stryder]
Number one in the race, you’re a leader
Girl, you’re out of this world, they can't see ya (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
And now you got a place in my heart, it's funny how you actually went
From my homie to my only number one
