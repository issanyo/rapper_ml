Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh Na Na Na Na Na (x2)

Hear me out…

This is my king’s speech, I’m nowhere near the end
If I s-stutter… Sorry I ain’t heaven’s sent
I messed my life up, yeah I’ve been down
I’m a changed man now… Chris Brown
Ya know I feel your pain ‘cos I done been through it

I’m Kurt Cobain but I just couldn’t do it
No point in turning back, just to hit rewind
Back To The Future.. Ma.. Marty McFly
Be the deciders with fire’cos I’m no longer looking in a reflection that I admire
I paint a picture of a fire… But there’s no one looking back at me since I’m a liar

If I should die before I wake.. The least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith…

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)
No point in crying over yesterday

No Regrets (x2)
‘Cos we ain’t even seen the best of days

Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh Na Na Na Na Na
Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh

This is my last chance, I’m on my final straw
I came so close to b-breaking like a spinal chord
I came from nothing… Some kid in Camden
Now I’m flying with the birds.. Richard Branson
I’m a prince.. Yes I will.. Get the crown
Kate stays in my dungeon when her sister’s round
So please forgive me.. If I make mistakes
But I’ll blow the bloody doors off… Michael Caine

If I should die before I wake.. The least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith…

Ohhhhhh

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)
No point in crying over yesterday

No Regrets (x2)
‘Cos we ain’t even seen the best of days

I’m free to be whatever I…
‘Cos I’m famous.. Call me Gallagher.. ‘Cos I’m so shameless
The papers sold a page at the cost of my failures
Victimised by the public… don’t know if I can take this
So I sing “So when you feel like there’s no more nothing left but the life you’ve broken.”
No regrets.. No turning back.. Pick up yourself and tell them I’m just being me…

Ohhhhhh

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)
No point in crying over yesterday

No Regrets (x2)
No Regrets…

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)
No point in crying over yesterday

No Regrets (x2)
‘Cos we ain’t even seen the best of days

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No…No. Nobody crying over yesterday
