[Intro: Dappy]
Na na naii
Ooh, na, na, ooh, na, na
Yeah, yeah, yeah
N-Dubz, N-Dubz, N-Dubz

[Verse 1: Dappy]
It's like first things first, you probably think I'm a chap with good manners
Well, you're wrong, I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the worst of the worst and I ain't boasting 'bout my verses
I'm speaking 'bout the way I run around snatching purses
For every meaning, there's a purpose
Just because I never went to school, it don't mean that I can't be perfect
For screaming' out loud
We's addicted to money like two fingers tapping on wherever there's a vein
And believe me, yeah we're proud cause life is getting sicker by the day
And therefore we'll always stick around
Tonight you'll see the size of me, you wouldn't think I'm any harm, innit?
Think again, I'll take your wallet nicely
Chat up your wife to be, middle class daddy's girl
I think I need to get me one and your one looks just right for me
Isn't it funny how money can make a lot of people change?
You think your my friend, blud I'm tellin' you, you ain't

[Hook: Dappy]
You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
Cause all they ever do is just bring me down
So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money, that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?

[Verse 2: Tulisa]
I remember once upon a time when I was just thirteen
So innocent and giving, everyone would act like they love me
Then all the bitching and rumours began, seemed like I didn't have any friends
So much hate, lies and deceit, caused by all that jealousy
Now do you bitches really think
That I'm the same girl I used to be?
Do you really think I will back down from you hoes
If you try to bring it to me?
I know you're hating cause your man keeps watching
But I don't even want him, so tell him stop clocking
The more you hate I get closer to my goal
You'll wake up as nothing at twenty years old

[Hook: Dappy]
You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
Cause all they ever do is just bring me down
So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money, that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?

[Verse 3: Fazer]
Yeah, I remember them days when I didn't have no rhymes
Practicing my verse in the class 'til it was home time
I never used to pay attention in school
Was playing penny up the wall or in detention with fools
That's why most the teachers used to doubt me
They used to say I wouldn't make in my music, just to see me get rowdy
So I could switch in the classroom for an excuse to kick me out
I wonder why I'm bunking all my lessons in the bathroom
Now I'm starving hungry, working hard for this super stardom life
Been kinda hard for me to try and make it right
And it's hard to decide, whether I should leave behind
All my peeps in this life, to move forward and seek what I find
This life is lethal like a crack baby being born addicted to the crack
So much evil in people
Dappy said it first, so I guess that I'm the sequel
So just because I'm black it don't mean that I can't be equal

[Hook: Dappy]
You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
Cause all they ever do is just bring me down
So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money, that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?
You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
Cause all they ever do is just bring me down
So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money, that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?
