[Intro: Dappy & Tulisa]
What we shared was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like
What we shared was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like ouch

[Verse 1: Tulisa]
6:30 in the morning, I've arrived early from tour
Step into the house, I'm walking up the stairs
1 step, 2 step, 3 step, 4
I'm on the second floor, I'm opening the door
I could not brace my self for what I saw
Who's this woman in my bed?
"Name's Shaniqua and what?"
Nah, get the hell off of my baby

[Pre-Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Now she the type of lady
That every man needs, she's straight up feisty
She keeps me on my feet
But I don't wanna fuck things up by 6
Some other hoe in our bed
What do you take me for?
To hell with you
To hell with me?
Yeah, I never wanna see your face again

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa & Fazer]
Where the fuck do you think you is going?
I loved you so much, but you cheated on me
What we shared was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like ouch
It used to be the other way around but
The story changed, my heart is breaking
You need to recognize she was just a
I think it's time for me to go

[Verse 2: Dappy]
Semi brown skin beauty had to get it back
I understand she upset, she wanna kick and slap
But true say I'm from the slum, I would never stand for that
Fake underneath the bridge with that fake looking twat
Now remember when we were financially unstable
Channel 1 to 5, no Sky or cable
Had to do some dirty work in order to be able
To take care of you and put some food on the table

[Verse 3: Fazer]
See actions speak louder then words
I can't blame her for wanting the worse
She might be wishing that I'm dead, but I know she don't mean it
Think when I found them Nike's, I couldn't believe it
Remember when we had the feds knocking at our door
You took care of the stash and hid the money from the drawer
You done the right thing, they had me up on the floor
So you saved me from getting 5 years or more, that's why

[Pre-Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Now she the type of lady
That every man needs, she's straight up feisty
She keeps me on my feet
But I don't wanna fuck things up by 6
Some other hoe in our bed
What do you take me for?
To hell with you
To hell with me?
Yeah, I never wanna see your face again

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa & Fazer]
Where the fuck do you think you is going?
I loved you so much, but you cheated on me
What we shared was no ordinary
I felt the same until you had to go and just stab my heart like ouch
It used to be the other way around but
The story changed, my heart is breaking
You need to recognize she was just a
I think it's time for me to go

[Verse 4: Dappy & Fazer & Tulisa]
See how's this suppose to solve the situation?
When were both as stubborn as each other
We would argue for hours over something dumb
What the fuck?
Sssh, conversation done
How our ego trips never help us get nowhere
You should know this by now
When you shout I smile, when you hit me I laugh
I get all cocky like, bitch go run me a bath
So you wanna play it like that
But baby I can get back
You don't wanna feel my
Ouch, ouch, ouch
I've done it before; I'll do it again
Just
Leave me alone

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa & Fazer]
Where the fuck do you think you is going?
I loved you so much, but you cheated on me
