[Hook: Tulisa & Dappy]
Don't get nine, nine, nine
You only get one chance, don't get nine
Don't get nine, nine, nine
You only get, only get, only get
Don't get nine, nine, nine
You only get one chance, don't get nine
Don't get nine, nine, nine
You only get, only get, only get

[Verse 1: Tulisa]
The other day two of my friends told me that you liked me
Would do just about anything to spend the night with me
But for me to like you, gotta have you, me, better have class
And by the looks of it you got much more than asked

[Pre-Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
See every other girl I've been with
Yeah had her face all up in my business
What so why with you I need to chase ya
Cause I'm all about that paper
See every other man I've been with
I realise I never could live with
Until you came into my life
You just might change it all for me so

[Hook: Tulisa & Dappy]
Boy you come across my life
Kiss me for the first time
Prove to me that you're all mine
Cause you only get one chance, don't get nine
Trust, don't try and waste my time
I'm feelin' you, you on my mind
But remember
You only get one chance, don't get nine
Don't get nine, nine, nine
You only get one chance, don't get nine
Don't get nine, nine, nine
You only get, only get, only get

[Verse 2: Dappy & Tulisa]
Let me upgrade your life
I would treat you just the same as my dad treated his wife
Everyday could be your birthday
Don't need to worry 'bout the price, I could buy that twice
What am I on? Have you heard my song?
Do you know who I am or are you leadin' me on?
Do you think that I care cause you sang "I Swear"?
You lil idiot, get out of here

[Verse 3: Fazer & & Dappy & Tulisa]
Ah blad are you dumb?
What do you mean am I dumb?
Don't let her talk to you like she some bum
Oi, bean head, shut up
Who you tellin' to shut up about bean head?
Whatever
So blad are you blind?
What do you mean am I blind?
This girl's taken me a decade to find
Oi, you the true meanin' of a stunner
But crossed your line, but believe I'm gonna

[Verse 4: Dappy & Tulisa]
Every time that you turn around
My eyes can't help but go down
Girl, you're such a tease
Tell me what I gotta do to get you
Look, I ain't tryna be rude
But you just made me wanna
So you wanna go on there
Babe, all talk, but I'm not easy, it won't be easy
No, but if you wait, baby believe me
My touch will guarantee you'll never leave
So take a chance and cross my line

[Hook: Tulisa]
