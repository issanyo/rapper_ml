[Intro]
D-A-P-P-Y
Na na
Na na

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be coool
I will survive
Even if I tell my boss to do one and a quit my 9-5
He knows the score
Watch me walk straight out the door
Could someone tell my mama not to worry she raised an entrepreneur

[Hook]
Let's rain on em, we rain on em
Like we ain't gotta pay no bills
Splashed up, splash down
Tell me how good does that feel
Cuz I'm cool
Oh what a night
See I won't take no shit cuz only I can rule my life

[Verse 1]
If I'm still gassed then I'm doing it the ends way
Don't be coming up in and messing up my fengshui
You know what that means
That means self-made
So Barbies coming with me whatever Ken say
Comprend√©
That's that
Catch me ravin' up in Essex in my snapback
Wagone to this bitches messin' up my side partin
Oi Joey better give me my hat back
I love my life you should see what I rolled through the ends in
When they dropped the iPhone S guess who was still trending
Shoulda bought a Ferrari and a Lambo
Instead I had to buy a tour bus to fit all of my friends in
So if jealousy could kill I would be dead right now
Dead right now
Off on my 'ead right now
Cuz I'm the cherry on top
Worth hundreds and thousands
I scream money everytime I call my accountant
Ha ha

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I'm cool
I will be fine
Even if I tell that b*tch to do one and I dashed her out my ride
We both know the score
You're gonna try slam the door
Well you can tell daddy he can have you back cuz I don't need this anymore

[Hook]
Let's rain on em, well we rain on em
I wish I never bought you them heels
Shine on em, Shine on em
So much for your cheap thrills
Cuz I'm cool
Oh what a night
See, I won't take no shit cuz only I can rule my life

[Verse 2]
If I went pen you wouldn't be the one I write to
Good luck to the new sucka that you're lying to
And if he wants to know why my ex keeps hitting me up
Tell him theres no one that can hit it like I do, (Uh, now)
Ah man, you should see my new ting swinging on my Tarzan
When I go in so deep the bitch can't speak
Cuz I'm a centaur compared to her last man, (Aoo)
You know me I keep it 300
Jus signed a dotted line and got 300
Easy come easy go, So when it's all gone to me it jus won't mean nothin
So if jealousy could kill I would be dead right now
Dead right now
Off on my 'ead right now
And I ain't scared of shit
So fuck you and your gat man
The biggest enemy I got right now is the tax man
Ha ha
Either way I'm cool
