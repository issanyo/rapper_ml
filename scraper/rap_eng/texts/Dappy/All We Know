[Intro]
I’m with the guys, I’m with the guys
I’m with the guys, I’m with the guys

[Chorus]
I’m with the guys, I’m with the guys
Shout out to bros, let’s get that dough (let’s get it), that’s all we know
She got that loud, she movin’ wild, she love the vibe
If that’s your girl (if that’s your), then that’s your L (then that’s your), I wish you well

[Verse 1]
Long live the king (king), where have you been?
Wha? Me? Where ya been?
All around the world cause they pay me to sing
Now I’m skrrtin’ 'round town in the waviest ting
‘Member when I couldn’t cop nuttin' expensive?
And did shows just to cover the expenses?
Now I embrace these seats cah they looking all
Pearly white like they were made by a dentist, ha
You know the drill (oou), I been tourin’ since I made Trill (hey)
I might have the biggest smile on my face but you’ll never know how I feel, ha
Some of us learn it the hard way, had to search for the light in a dark place, ha
All these bitches come and go that’s why I roll with the... (skr, skr)

[Chorus]
Roll with the guys (roll with the guys), I’m with the guys
Shout out to bros, let’s get that dough, that’s all we know
She got that loud, she movin’ wild, she love the vibe
If that’s your girl, then that’s your L, I wish you well

[Verse 2]
This bezel shines all through the nighttime, it’s gon’ be a dirty summer
That lizzy opens doors so keep your queen on lock
She’ll only let off at the right time
She’ll do the crime, on my momma’s life
I was ‘bout to chop it, but there’s a time and a place
She wants to kiss but there’s money to chase
She lives in the Capital - so she Xtra
So you can imagine how many man try to finesse her
Day after day she bad, wait ‘til she lands in LA, mad
Oh lord, all these bitches come and go that’s why I roll with the...

[Chorus]
Roll with the guys (roll with the guys), I’m with the guys
Shout out to bros, let’s get that dough, that’s all we know
She got that loud, she movin’ wild, she love the vibe
If that’s your girl, then that’s your L, I wish you well

[Verse 3]
We all go through highs and lows (yeah), I guess this the life we chose (yeah)
And I done kick down doors before, so if I were you I would stay on them toes
It’s only right, I ain’t gon’ lie-ie
And she wanna roll with me-ee (uh uh ah)
But there’s a time and a place, pssh You should see what’s on her face
She wanted a ring but I married the game
One day I’ma get that crib in LA with a lake and a gate
One door leads to another
You can keep her to yourself it’s nada
Now you know how
All these bitches come and go that’s why I roll with the...

[Chorus]
Roll with the guys, I’m with the guys
Shout out to bros, let’s get that dough, that’s all we know
She got that loud, she movin’ wild, she love the vibe
If that’s your girl, then that’s your L, then that’s your L boy

[Outro]
Then that’s your L boy
Then that’s your L, then that’s your L
Roll with the guys, with the
Then that’s your L boy
Then that’s your L, then that’s your L
Hey
