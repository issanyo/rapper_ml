[Verse 1]
Sing along with me if you know the words it goes it goes
6:30 in the morning I've arrived early from tour
Step into the house I'm walking up the stairs
1 step, 2 step, 3 step, 4
I'm on the second floor, I'm opening the door

Who's this woman in my bed?
"Name's Shaniqua and what?"
Nah, get the hell off of my baby

I dedicate this debut album to one man only
To this day I remember everything you shown me

I dedicate this album to him
He's the reason why we did an N-Dubz skin
See the thigs we started off
So now you see why we had to call this Uncle B
