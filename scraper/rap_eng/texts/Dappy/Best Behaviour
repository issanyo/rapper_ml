[Verse 1: Dappy]
I dragged my bags off the plane today
A little too much fun on tour
Lord, please help me find my keys
Or I'm banging down my own door
All the cheerin' and all the applause
Who could ask for more?
Now I wouldn't mind finding a real thing waiting
When my bags finally hit the floor
See, I need some kind of lady that will feed me daily
Every time I come home she'll be waiting for me
Cause I've been thinkin' lately that life alone is crazy
I wanna hold somebody when I sleep

[Hook: Tulisa] + (Dappy)
Who's gonna be the one to save me?
Will I ever settle down?
All I do is run around
(This is taking too long)
Love is all I need
(Love is all I need)
I've waited all my life
(Waited all my life)
Love is all I need
(Love is all I need)
I've waited all my life
(You got me on my best behaviour)
(Whoa, whoa)
Hurry up, I'm in danger, baby
Whoa, how long before ya save me, baby?

[Verse 2: Tulisa]
I just finished the tour today
And my bags dropped to my door
(Bags dropped to my door)
Walked up to an empty room
Now I'm cryin' on my own floor
All the bright lights and all the surprises
Tell me what they mean
If I'm standin' on a stage in front of so many people
And I feel like it's just me
See, I need some kind of man that, that can understand me
The female boss is who I have to be
Sometimes I get lonely, I just need a homie
Then I might let him be the boss of me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fazer]
Cause I'm down there, caged in, burnt out, achin'
Seen it all before, done with all the heart breakin'
Cause I'm fed up, lonely, no longer the old me
Right now could use some company, I need someone to cool my
Ya taking to long hurry up, come to the rescue
Fly away with me and hold me
I'll cherish you like a trophy
If I don't know how to be then show me
Where are ya down here is a no-go
I can't keep on riding solo
I don't wanna have to wait all my life

[Outro: Dappy]
How long before ya save me, baby? [x4]
