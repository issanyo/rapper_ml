[Hook: Dappy]
I swear, I swear I miss the times when you would tie me to a chair
And tease me from the back of my neck right up to my ear
She would have me to herself, she didn't want nobody else
But I, see that was at the time
I see her kissing some other guy underneath the bridge
I never thought she would have done a thing like this
So I'm sorry, make your way towards the door
And never show your face again, bitch

[Verse 1: Dappy]
So who do you think I am? Who do you think you are? What the fuck's this? What's he doing here?
This are my apartment, tell him to duck home
I swear, I get him stripped down to his boxers
He's chilling and see time, end up in your library in Oxford
Tell me what do you see in a dude like this? He can't even look me in the eyes
I can see straight through him, he's just a bitch
Do you feel him cause he's rich and did you leave me cause I'm broke?
You was only with me yesterday, you still bustin' my coke
You know I'm a sicko, sicko like my local pubs owner
What was Stanley Suk and ball screwdriver, straight candid artist soldier
I'mma fuck ya, thought you love me
I mean these days you see me and you don't even hug me

[Pre-Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Now you and I, yeah we share something special
Are you out of your mind?
But I'm really sorry give me one more try
Cause everything you do got me goin' and I just can't lose this

[Hook: Dappy]
I swear, I swear I miss the times when you would tie me to a chair
And tease me from the back of my neck right up to my ear
She would have me to herself, she didn't want nobody else
But I, see that was at the time

I never thought she would have done a thing like this
So I'm sorry, make your way towards the door
And never show your face again, bitch

[Verse 2: Tulisa]
I swear, I know I lied to you
I should've told the truth
I couldn't hurt your feelings
So I lied when I told you
That I was chillin' with my girl
When really I was somewhere else
Baby, if you gave me all the love I needed
Then this wouldn't have happened
Have you forgotten the days when
Where you did the same thing to me and I forgave you baby?

[Pre-Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Now you and I, yeah we share something special
Are you out of your mind?
But I'm really sorry give me one more try
Cause everything you do got me goin' and I just can't lose this

[Verse 3: Fazer & Tulisa]
Yesterday morning coming home at 5:34
The final show was cancelled, I'm back early from tour
Soon as I open the door, I see a pair of shoes on the floor
I know they ain't mine, I'm hundred percent sure
Now there's wild thoughts just running through my head, I'm thinkin' of war
Pacing up the stairs as quick as I can to the top floor
Half way there, pick up a tool that's laying on the floor boards
Saying Lord, don't tell me this girl's turned to a whore
Who the hell's shoes are these?
I thought they were your new Nike's
Don't take me for a fool, I don't wear shoes like these, so don't lie to me
What do you mean?
Where's he hiding?
I know you got a man up in here so why the fuck you lyin'?

[Pre-Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Now you and I, yeah we share something special
Are you out of your mind?
But I'm really sorry give me one more try
Cause everything you do got me goin' and I just can't lose this
