[Verse 1: K-Koke]
Fucking hell I'm back here again
Shit's crazy, Feds think I'm at it again
They kicked off my door, try to tackle the stairs
I'm in my room like, what the fuck is happening here?
The Fed cuff me, sat me down on a chair
He said he's got me, he's tryna inject fear
I know it's not me, they want me, I see things clear
My Gran was wilin' out like 'He's been here'
Written statement, no comment interview
He gave me a smile then asked for an interview
Then showed me a picture of some different yute
(What you tryna say Koke? This isn't you?)
I'm wide awake though, this isn't proof
(Ahh let's charge him and send him on a prison groove)
No bail, for something that I didn't do
In my cold cell, I feel invisible

[Hook: Dappy & K-Koke]
Ay, if you read between the lines you might just even get it
See I ain't even lyin' that's what everybody say
When your freedom's on the line and you're running out of time
Fuck this! Fuck this! That's just the story of my life
You live, you learn when the tables turn
And that's when shit don't turn out exactly how you like
Take a risk and roll the dice
But you might just pay the price (uh, alright)
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! (yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 2: K-Koke]
How can I make you understand?
Feds are shuttin' down my shows puttin' cuffs up on my hands
They search my whole family
Troubling the band
Shuttin' down corners and jumpin' out of vans
They're talking about firearms, something 'bout a gang
They cut me off Wireless and run up in my Grans
They run in my baby mother's mother's yard, lookin' for some firearms
And didn't find 'em darg, them man are lying sarge
But who cares another case is closed
Then I caught another case a couple days ago
Fuck, I hope I buss it, man I'm prayin though
Got me looking to the sky like what you playin for?
Why don't you save me Lord?
How could I even not see my baby born?
Crazy thoughts
Chains and bolts
Stuck up in the system
Just wishin' that I make it home

[Hook: Dappy]
Ay, if you read between the lines you might just even get it see
I ain't even lyin' that's what everybody say
When your freedom's on the line and you're running out of time
Fuck this! Fuck this! That's just the story of my life
You live, you learn when the tables turn
And that's when shit don't turn out exactly how you like
Take a risk and roll the dice
But you might just pay the price
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

But you might just pay the price
Fuck it, fuck it
