[Verse 1: Dappy]
Yo, I am a rapper slash and singer-songwriter
From when I was a younger even up to this day
Man are tryna drag me under
What a bumba, you know that you can find me, I never change my number
I don't mind if these private callers
Wanna carry on blinging off my line, I'm happy to remind
Them that if their gyal was to see me on their ones
They would wanna bad me up or give me the shines
I'm a dapper X white gold chain ripper
Crack pusher, man, if need be
Last man to put his hands on my chain found himself
In a scarred... oil greazy (Ni)
Nananizle, north east, south west, whole of the country
I'm kinda famous, thanks popsy
You want food? Stay around Dubzy
C's got the leng ting, trust me

[Hook: Dappy & Tulisa]
Bun your cheap talk
What do you think I am?
See me, me, me, I'm on a mad ting
You don't understand
Never will I sing-sing to the feds
Like couple man I know, know, know
(Snitch, plonker, fool)
Yo, if you're stacking up P and you ain't on fronting
Then you have the right to represent London
Know me? Na na na na, ni ni, na na na na
If you've got your own whip and you're earning paper
Then you have the right to be a heartbreaker
Know me?
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Wiley]
Yo, Eskiboy, I'm a winner, producer, artist, MC killer
Everytime I go to pick a mic up, frighteners
I'm with the true riders, real top billers
If you listen to my new album, there's no fillers
Got an N-Dubz beat, cold chiller
Mum said stay away from the gold diggers
But I ain't gonna lie, I like sharing, and she like staring
And none of us are caring, sex after dinner
I'm a wheeler dealer, X brown and white T-shirts
Nike track suit with the black Fila
I didn't ever wanna follow others, I'm a leader
Said I was a fool but I am a book reader
Catch a couple haters call me a cheater
Got a couple of fans and now I don't ya (Ni)
It's only right I'm wearing my Rolex
Hello standard procedure

[Hook]

[Bridge: Fazer & Tulisa]
Wait til you see what I end up with (mills)
Momma didn't raise no dumb kid
Came from the dirt and nicking man's Merc
But now I'm in a Beemer, one series turbs
Money, money makes the world go round
The same way the money makes the girls go down
Blatantly killing them
No more paying man a hundred pound
Straight ten grand minimum
My car, my house, my bills
These bitches know the deal (tell em T)
Cause they're all paid by me
I got my own money and I
Ain't looking for no footballers
So if you wanna bring it to me
Let's take it back
I will defeat you

[Hook]
