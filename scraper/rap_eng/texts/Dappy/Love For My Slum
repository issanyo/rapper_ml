[Hook: Dappy]
I've never had love for the feds but I've always had love for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So all my people in the slum, put your hands up, brap
See it never used to come that easy
And I was just sliding my way
I dunno how I did it but I will carry on 'til the die that I day

[Verse 1: Dappy]
I ain't gonna lie, mama tried the best to bring me up right
Guess it never worked, she always cries
I was always involved in crime from the age of 9
Music got me find of famous, now they want a piece of pie
Blud I'm blowin' up the scene, but I dunno where my bed is
I smoke so much weed cause I dunno where my head is
I might have some fame but I'm still low on credit
Management love the money, someone tell me where my bread is
I come across a lot of rich kids that die to be thugs
But I don't understand them, they're very very loved
They don't wake up in the morning to see man pipin' dubs
Or have to worry about the goons with the .38 snubs
You got too much to lose, you're in a great position
How can you be hood if my whole frickin' flat is smaller than your kitchen?
You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from, you'd go missin'
So appreciate what you've got cause, with that I'm still wishin', brap

[Hook: Dappy]
I've never had love for the feds but I've always had for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So all my people in the slum, put your hands up, brap
See it never used to come that easy
And I was just sliding my way
I dunno how I did it but I will carry on 'til the die that I day

[Verse 2: Baker Trouble & Dappy]
I ain't gonna lie, I make broke look good, more time I supply
Just tryna get by, you should never ask me why
I smoke 'til my lips split
They always send me dry to stop movin' like a criminal
Is what I try but you live by the roads
By the roadside you die
I real in every situation, should make man humble like pie
I've never had love for the feds cause they don't give man alibi
They holdin' man under arrest, takin' time out of my life
Once time's taken, time can't take back
We're from a place where it's all B and C cats
Some real most idiots, mommy's tryin' hard, we can see that
Once the road takes the youths, they won't be back
I get love on the road, I got feedback
Never had it, but I'm takin' the scene back
Any trap that's bangin' rubber, I weed that
Never had it for long, follow and trust me they need that
Push ya hand up in the air and give me that

[Hook: Dappy]
I've never had love for the feds but I've always had for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So all my people in the slum, put your hands up, brap
See it never used to come that easy
And I was just sliding my way
I dunno how I did it but I will carry on 'til the die that I day

[Verse 3: Baker Trouble & Dappy]
'Til the day that I die
Na na naii
Come along
How's ya day?
What you wat?
Same old
I'm livin' wrong
I'm in the stud' makin' moves
I'm on the roads movin' food
Either way we're makin' paper
Makin' paper
Dapz
I'm mister Baker
You won't get us on ya stage unless it's 5 bills or over
Knockin' doors like our CD like a witness from Johova
So where's the bitch Lola?
I should have brought her over
So she could suck the [?]
All my mandem are dark
Everyone eats like they're sharks
Been through so much different shit
The pain will never leave my heart
I'll make you shit ya pants like gettin' stuck with food in your car
So I suggest you listen close, trust me you could be a star
So what do ya think?
Do ya still wanna live like me and him?
You make me sick
You talk gun talk
You ain't even seen the stick
Don't be upset, why do ya have to cry
Na na naii
'Til the day that we die

[Hook: Dappy]
I've never had love for the feds but I've alway had for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So all my people in the slum, put your hands up, brap
See it never used to come that easy
And I was just sliding my way
I dunno how I did it but I will carry on 'til the die that I day

[Outro: Dappy & Baker Trouble]
I'm afraid that's all you getting, goodnight
God bless
And when you wake up in the mornin'
Try not to be stressed
I wish I had what you had
I ain't got nothin', my life's a mess
So be thankful for your situation
Stop actin' like a pest
I'm afraid that's all you're getting, goodnight
God bless
And when you wake up in the mornin'
Try not to be stressed
I wish I had what you had
I ain't got nothin', my life's a mess
So be thankful for your situation
Stop actin' like a pest
