Yo, I'm like lately seeing like
Many man-a coming up with funny little skanks and ting but
When I'm on a skankin' ting, no lie I'm on a blankin' ting
And if you feel my shit, I'm on a thankin' ting
But if you bring a pretty girl around me
I'm on a spankin' ting, it's no wankin' ting ai
See me I'm on a stancin' ting, forever more I shall be the skankin' king

So if you wanna come hotel, don't waste time
Only get one chance, don't get nine
Like cartel said "mi cocky longer than mi nine"
So back it up and call it bump and grind
I'm a man, you're a female
And I hate when a chick make her bum look big on Facebook
But they can't back their rows in up in detail
Don't bring your pictures, don't know your emails

Yo, I'm a hard worker but I'm not a grime MC
So anytime I get a day off I like writing angry lyrics
With my friends reminiscing about the days
When we used to lick a lot of shots on the block
And go to girls hostels (Aah!)
Shank them then leave their best friend
You're the shit to my shoe
(waste)
Dad shoulda splashed on the floor in your mom's face

Hey, if you're a duku man, you've gotta be stackin' up duku grands
No fools round here, no lulus man
You man are spooky, you do voodoo (You do voodoo?)

What planet are you on you must be cuckoo
I don't wanna put a thing in Fifi's hands
'Cause you're real definitely, make it, go duku
We're supposed to have rules, not lulus
Never have I seen a man run that fast
I'm surprised that he never done a poo poo (fart noise)
Oi donut, dickhead beenie man's cousin
Pussy lick it more than a dozen
I did ask Tulisa, and she told me that:
("I will never shag a man unless I love him!")
Zagaza, I wanna be fake ragamuffin
How can you let a likkle man like me make
Two grown men like you start dussin'
Never talk to their friends when they come and start duckin'
You men are buggin', wanna talk shit behind my back
When you see me start runnin'
You bein' heavy like a ton full of bricks, N-Dubz got a bag full of hits
You and your boys are back full of pricks, if we come to your party
You know we're gonna leave with all of the chicks

If you're a duku man, you've gotta be stackin' up duku grands
No fools round here, no lulus man
You man are spooky, you do voodoo (Dooks tell me...)

What would you if you're in a club dancin'
A man rollin' with his girlfriend on a sad ting
And she starts givin' you the eye like it's a bang ting
I know what I would do I ain't rampin' (Dooks)
I would take her to the toilet, put her in a sink
Give her willy, till the "bye den" wink
Don't think I'm buyin' you a drink, you are not my girlfriend
You're just another link, I don't care what you think

When I die, don't bury me, burn me
By the way things are goin', I might die early
I hate MCs that get away with swag lines like:
I'm a killer and no one can hurt me
When I die don't bury me, freeze me
By the way things are goin' I might die easy
I hate MCs that come out with dead lines like:
I shoot crack and rhymes like Jeezy
Many men i know are livin' in a dreamland
Thinkin' they can play two notes on a keyboard
And come up with a song like ours
Your mixtape stinks like a fart (fart noise)
My album's a slut in the charts
Half a million of my CDs got shift like hot cakes over the counter
So could you please stop standin' in the west, when you can't even sell
Two of them in an hour, go go cobunion
I clunked you with a shank then done them
I'm from a place called North West London
I heard your mum's got bunions fam, what!
