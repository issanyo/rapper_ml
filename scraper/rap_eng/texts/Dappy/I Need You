[Intro: Dappy]
I need you, you, you, I need ya
I need you, you, you, I need ya
Baby, I need you, you, you, I need ya
I need you, you, you, I need ya

[Verse 1: Dappy] + (Fazer)
Last night was a blur but all I remember is
Black shirt, bare carats on my wrist
Me and a couple man rollin' up in a whip
Met a pretty young lady, should I say bitch?
Will I ever see you again?
(Always lookin' for another mans riches)
Why do you do this to us men?
(And that's why we call them bitches)
See I don't understand
She wasn't with a man
How could I leave without her number in my hand?
I went to go on Facebook
Will I get her face back?
Tryna' find you is like a needle in a haystack

[Pre-Hook: Dappy]
I came so close
You touched my body
You left me standing like a statue
Baby, I need you

[Hook: Dappy]
I was missing yesterday
Pissed, I never took your number
Now you're nowhere to be found
I'm goin' mad I need you
I've been searching all over Facebook
And I can't seem to find you
I really have to find you
Baby I need you, you, you, I need ya
I need you, you, you, I need ya

[Verse 2: Tulisa]
Last night I met a fella
He made me feel so oh, oh, oh
That could mean what you want it to mean
Pop to the ladies for a sec
(Er, I'll be back in five, yeah)
But when I came back, had he left
I felt so alone
He left me standing in my LBD
And my bang bang shoes
I was so confused

[Pre-Hook: Dappy]
I came so close
You touched my body
You left me standing like a statue
Baby, I need you

[Hook: Dappy]
I was missing yesterday
Pissed, I never took your number
Now you're nowhere to be found
I'm goin' mad I need you
I've been searching all over Facebook
And I can't seem to find you
I really have to find you
Baby, I need you

[Bridge: Dappy] + (Tulisa)
See now I gotta find someone like you
(You ain't gonna find no-one like me)
So tell me what the hell I should do
Will I ever find someone just like you?
(I don't think so, not quite like me)
Girl you're one in a million
(I'm one in a million)

[Verse 3: Fazer] + (Tulisa)
Yo, what do I need to do to find you girl?
Cause you could be the one to make a change in my world
Maybe one day I'll put a ring around your finger
You should try being with a singer
And do you know the meaning of it's dark in jail?
Until we meet again my hearts on bail
Wherever you are right now
I just wanna let you know, that
(You're my love)

[Hook: Dappy]
I was missing yesterday
Pissed, I never took your number
Now you're nowhere to be found
I'm goin' mad I need you
I've been searching all over Facebook
And I can't seem to find you
I really have to find you
Baby, I need you

[Bridge: Dappy] + (Tulisa)
See now I gotta find someone like you
(You ain't gonna find no-one like me)
So tell me what the hell I should do
Will I ever find someone just like you?
(I don't think so, not quite like me)
Girl you're one in a million
(I'm one in a million)

[Outro: Dappy]
I need you, you, you, I need ya
I need you, you, you, I need ya
Baby I need you, you, you, I need ya
I need you, you, you, I need ya
Baby, I need you [x4]
