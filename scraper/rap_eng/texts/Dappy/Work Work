[Hook: Dappy]
I never thought I would ever get this far
But I guess I was wrong
Work, work
To me there's no such thing as giving up
You can be anything you wanna be
Put your mind to it then
You'll succeed in life
I never thought I would ever get this far
But I guess I was wrong
Hustle, hustle
To me there's no such thing as giving up
You can do anything you want to do
Keep at it, keep at it then
You'll succeed in life

[Verse 1: Dappy & Tulisa]
See stones can be used so well
Cause the money comes in bunches in space of hours
I don't wanna work for no prick
I'd rather chill here underneath these towers
But nor do I wanna go in jail and me have to look back everytime I'm in the showers
Are you mad? I've got a number 1 to make
Cheques to receive that you wouldn't believe
T show off your voice
Yeah

[Verse 2: Fazer]
See me I scream for the scrape on taxman rate
Government wonder why we show hate
When there's kids sayin' mummy, I'm starving hungry, need food in my tummy
Mama's crying out loud now cause she don't got no money
See she puts the kids first, she ain't ate for days
Exhausted, feelin' worn out
See I've been there before
Rice and corn, beef for like four weeks, shit

[Pre-Hook: Tulisa & Dappy]
So whatever you work as
Make sure you keep at it
I've seen a lot of lives go to waste
But as for me

[Hook: Dappy]
I never thought I would ever get this far
But I guess I was wrong
Work, work
To me there's no such thing as giving up
You can be anything you wanna be
Put your mind to it then
You'll succeed in life
I never thought I would ever get this far
But I guess I was wrong
Hustle, hustle
To me there's no such thing as giving up
You can do anything you want to do
Keep at it, keep at it then
You'll succeed in life

[Verse 3: Tulisa]
I can be what I wanna be, my life can't be worthless
There's got to be a point in living
I'll keep up 'til I succeed
It's never enough, there's more I can achieve
Ain't got no time for no boyfriends these days
I gotta stay focused, move things in my way
I've got to stay on top in this industry
These little Greek chicks got style you ain't never seen
So my friends want a piece of me
Haters wanna see me bleed
I got to be, have to be, on top of my game

[Pre-Hook: Tulisa & Dappy]
So whatever you work as
Make sure you keep at it
I've seen a lot of lives go to waste
But as for me

[Hook: Dappy]
I never thought I would ever get this far
But I guess I was wrong
Work, work
To me there's no such thing as giving up
You can be anything you wanna be
Put your mind to it then
You'll succeed in life
I never thought I would ever get this far
But I guess I was wrong
Hustle, hustle
To me there's no such thing as giving up
You can do anything you want to do
Keep at it, keep at it then
You'll succeed in life

[Verse 4: Dappy & Fazer & Tulisa]
Some people live a perfect life, spending thousands
Us in the gutter
Nunchuks make mothers cry by the thousands
If they only knew how it is where we grew
The things that we've see
They wanna call us thugs and we put our chin chins up so
So what the hell is going on in the world of today?
I don't really know, could you tell me T?
But I can't work it out, I can't work it out
I can't work it out
And what about us?
We'll survive it

[Hook: Dappy]
I never thought I would ever get this far
But I guess I was wrong
Work, work
To me there's no such thing as giving up
You can be anything you wanna be
Put your mind to it then
You'll succeed in life
I never thought I would ever get this far
But I guess I was wrong
Hustle, hustle
To me there's no such thing as giving up
You can do anything you want to do
Keep at it, keep at it then
You'll succeed in life

[Outro: Dappy & Fazer]
Oi, see mama keeps wishin' for a new kitchen
She needs more space when she cooks her chicken
Times are hard bruv
It's a family of five, two bedroom flat
Now tell me if you could relate to that
