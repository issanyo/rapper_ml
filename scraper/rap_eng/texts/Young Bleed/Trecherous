Ain't nothin to it but to do it when shits trecherous
Go to my ? and get sick wit it like da exorcists
Hataz can't get next to dis I flex wit dis

Or loose your life on purpose nigga

Dat nigga don't wanna see dat
I'm haunted by night stalkers to death
Rippin your click apart
Till it ain't no one left
Now who's da first to die

And paint a perfect picture 4 da pictionary
Nigga I hope you see what I'm seein
Bein A naughty nigga walkin da world
You can either swim wit da fishes
Or straight go nuts wit da squirels
Go call Earl my nigga
Shit he ain't listenin
I'm findin niggas shinin till dey glistenin
Steadily whisperin words through corridors
]From da 36
Chambers of Death
The vital signs of mental language iz der
You can't explain it yourself
So now you muggin me

But da people dey be buggin me
Maybe cuz of somethin dey heard
Come to find out dey recordin every word

[Hook] To all my niggas wit da Glock 9's
Dat's my nigga wit da 4-5
Dat's my nigga wit da tech 9
Dat's my nigga dodgin 1 time

I ain't talkin to savage niggas tryin to die next to me
Bitches break dey self to lie in ecstasy
Police claim dey catchin me
So all da savage niggas come wit weaponry
They lady lie down on da ground convicted felony
Dey tell every nigga to die young
If you down in da burough
Every ghetto thug ready to die thorough
Nigga act like you know if you don't know

Brakin bricks up in a big bag

Wanna light a spark
Cuz evil niggas glow in da dark ya heard me
Don't start no shit it won't be no shit
Until a nigga wanna snitch like a bitch
