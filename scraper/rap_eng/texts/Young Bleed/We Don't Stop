(Maxminelli talking)

Say check this out Bleed, look Concentration Camp in this bitch
Gettin  heavy, ya heard me? We all foldin paper nigga, you
Lucky Nuckles, that  nigga Loc, Big Happy, Lee Tyme, you know me
Maxminelli I'm foldin paper nigga, an Boo, an we layin low
Cuz that's what Lay Low do, ya heard me?
I'm tellin you, by the time that nigga OG come out of Paris
We gonna have somethin real swole to fold
My nigga down in Bam foldin paper, my nigga Poola
My nigga Big Poola Mic
An we be bout ta let em know what's the motherfuckin count say!

Chorus x1 (Maxminelli)

The mutha fuckin count don't stop, an they don't quit
Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit
You only live once that's how its cut
So where the weed Young Bleed? Let's get tore up!

Verse 1-(Young Bleed)

The ghetto got me givin up no love, tod ya this mornin
You gotta know a nigga yearnin
Niggas stole from the stop an go
An seperate my weed from the seeds
An roll an optimo
An saddle up my cattle cuz lets roll boy
An every nigga I know, livin it up like a cowboy
Shootin up some shit, for the fuck of it an I'm lovin it
I got a tray-80 for rainy days, an I'm huggin it, an muggin
While I'm sippin on a young tre-deuce, four-five
All the way live, wit my homies wanna ride, southside
Got yo mouth wide
Buggin for nothin, try to twerk somethin nigga
Or hurt somethin nigga
Look here, I be yo Huckleberry playin it rough
Quick on the draw like the last outlaw
Killin 'em softly
Hollerin' girl get off me
Tryin to boss me, an cost me a grip
An got the nerve to get flipped wit a nigga
But see Trix is for kids, silly rabbit
She gotta have it, tryin to give it here, I won't have it
Ya heard me fool
Only cool dawg puttin it down
Ain't gonna clown, while I'm smokin on a pound, my niggas say

(chorus) x2

Verse 2-(Young Bleed)

I'm gettin blind, just for piece of mind
Call it a crime, 'cause I'm steady dodgin' one time
An eye for an eye
Tryin to survive in this life of sin, niggas can't win
Steady ballin', but fallin'
Slowly but surely livin' unholy
Down an dirty by my stress, but that's
The way it is when you livin nappy like that
Aphrodisiac, Cognac, and fat chronic sack
Make you react, and flash back, reachin' for your gat, paranoid
Tattoo an' scar playin the cards you dealt
Ain't nothin left, but to go for self
Life in the ghetto
Ask no questions tell no lies, livin' uncivilized
Until you realize, you're stuck still paralyzied
Full of that weed, and a shadow of doubt
Without clout and clientele, tryin' to figure who it tell on
The pistol-packin' Jesse James got the precious 9 for center snipe
Tryin to maintain, the ways of the game
Plain an simple, pop a pimple on the face of the earth
An keep bailin, ain't no telling who's the next to be a felon
Nigga look keyed, he wiped the blood, sweat and tears of fear
They got me in here, tryin to steer clear
Hollin bout

(chorus) x2

Verse 3-(Young Bleed)

Criminal minded, you've been blinded
Lookin for a way to get out, you can't find it
Stop tryin, daily
But it's like they'd rather play me
Instead of pay me,(say what?)for my progression
Got me stressin' wit' a Smith an Wesson
Up against aggression and police protection, ugh
So what's a young nigga to do, at age 22
It's you against me, and me against you
To be continued as life goes on, in the panic zone
Searchin for the twilight, we learned to fly by night
Gettin high as a kite, taking a bite, outta crime
Designed to shatter mankind and losin' all state of mind
And blind to the fact, gettin money for crack, and powder
Money and power every hour, on the hour
A coward dies a thousand deaths
But a soldier dies once
Incarcerated, meditating like a monk
With visions of prisons, for livin' life do or die on the street
Mad-doggin' the world with funk beats
Holdin my heat
Smokin' on a blunt, waitin' for the first of the month, ta watch the
Jackers get crunk in this mutha fucka

We don't stop, an we don't quit
Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit
You only live once that's how it's cut
So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up

An say we don't stop an we don't quit
Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit
You only live once that's how it's cut
So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up

Cuz Lay Low don't stop an he don't quit
Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit
You only live once that's how it's cut
So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up

An Big Happy don't stop an he don't quit
Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit
You only live once that's how it's cut
So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up

An Young Bleed don't stop an he don't quit
Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit
You only live once that's how it's cut
So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up

Cuz C-Loc don't stop an he don't quit
Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit
(what ya got) makin money
(get them thangs when a nigga come up) make money, make money
You only live once that's how it's cut
So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up

Yeah, tryin to tell you, cuz we the sickest god damn it (echos off)
