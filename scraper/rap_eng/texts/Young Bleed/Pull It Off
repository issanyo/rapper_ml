They say to play with a man's money is to play with a man's life
And to play with a man's life means you playin' with your life
And like that nigga fay say
Motherfucker, play with your life, motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Nah-nah-nah
If it's a cost to be a boss I be hustlin' high
Without a doubt I'm in and out through my puzzling eyes
You can see I, through chain promise
Predicted but it gets wicked for real
I'm back up on the hill ho
Hollerin' if you ever play the game you know
The love I'm speakin' of
Face to face they wanna analyze young thug
Bone in it, swung in it
Don't get it about my papers, see I
Money makes the caper, money makes 'em player hate ya
So watch your back, but there's your aphrodisiac
Cognac and fast sex, ol' black ass nigga you
Nigga who? Really, really wanna
If they catch you when sleepin' you's a gonna
Boo-ya! Stuck off in a corner
Perpendicular, perplexed, and paralyzed
From the waist down, you shoulda recognized
Don't make me tie-tie you
My nigga, thank you!
But if you ever disrespect me I'ma bank you!
Nigga ha-ha, that's how the games goes
I'm in the same clothes I wore yesterday
Tryin' to take the stress away
Smokin' on some hey-hey
My nigga then, whatchoo wanna do?
I got more love than in our lives, so it's on you
To the east, that beat
My nigga be, hey, nigga

[Hook]
When you tryin' to get your grip pull it off
When them niggas set trippin' boy pull it off
When you ain't got no confetti and your palms is gettin' sweaty
Get your whole clique ready to pull it off

[Verse 2]
Now even though shit ain't worked out, how a nigga discussed it
Ain't no sense in sittin' around lookin' broke and disgusted
Mama told me there'd be days like this
She also told me ain't got time to sit and cry like no bitch
That's for phonies
If you have to, you have to nigga make that bitch bleed
If they had love for thugs, they know the thug in me
Now look here, blood, I ain't your Pappy
Don't care 'bout you bein' unhappy
All that whinin' like a bitch gonna make me slap ya
(Punk motherfucker)
Utilities and rental fees, all this killin' stressin'
False promises just like I figured get you disconnected
Time to let it go, it ain' the first but I know it's comin'
Any nigga in my way I'm straight dumpin'
Time for a T.K.O. fa' sho, it's just your stack
They already on the floor, I'm already at the bank
What you can't think
Two loaves of a bread and two sticks of butter
Equals four niggas deader than a motherfucker
But the bills paid

[Hook]
When you tryin' to get your grip pull it off
When them niggas set trip boy pull it off
When you ain't got no confetti and your palms is gettin' sweaty
Get your whole clique ready to pull it off

When you tryin' to get your grip nigga pull it off
When them niggas set trip boy pull it off
When you ain't got no confetti and your palms is gettin' sweaty
Get your whole clique ready to pull it off

[Verse 3]
Now get your grip nigga, shiver and moan
Gain the strength to be strong and I'm gone when the rope swings
Wish is to sling everything off attempting to grasp
Anything come false on this money-makin' path
They put my back to the wall
If I fall dark skies, eternal light if I rise
Ride, nigga, with a hop
'Cause now they all around with they gaze on
Tryin' maze a nigga life watchin' through the strife
Struggle and fight, the plight to excel
Got me gainin', nigga ain't fall time aimin'
At the box, straight headshots
Throw them all at you, get it?
At the rope, I shall rip at your throat 'til the hole broke
I got a thick special cream if you know what I mean
In a country full of junkies and river queens
Runnin' around this beyotch with the pipe in they mouth
I don't know why, but time tryin' to put moms in the house

[Verse 4]
Here comes that five-ten walkin'
Black man nigga staller
Everywhere I go gotta pack my forty-four revolver
I'm a baller, that's tryin' to protect my paper from them haters
All you ignorant and nasty ways, it'll never make ya greater
It'll break ya, plus take you for a nigga where you live
So pay attention to life, don't get it wrong
There's a chance you might get killed
On the real my nigga, watch your everyday move 'cause these niggas wanna see you lose
But me, myself, and I
Ever since the day of birth gotta pay my dues
Gotta watch them food stamps, livin' in trailer life
Gotta head up the righteous path
They got niggas committin', even tried to play me out
But I leave them all left to style
From what I see in society, sell niggas a dream
Get the peaches and cream, but it ain't all that it seems
Tryin' to tell you my nigga that you can trust in this song
From the day you're here, then the next day you're gone
