[Intro]
Shit nigga, fuck shit
Man, I've been hustlin' all my motherfuckin' life
Nigga shit, (Fuckin' right) niggas trippin' and player-hatin' on what I got (Jive ass niggas)
Man fuck that shit nigga
When I wanted to have it, fuck I know where to took, when I dang got the shit (The shit)
I ain't lay around bitchin' and boo-hooin' and cryin' about...
That nigga there a ho 'cause he got this like this
Man fuck that, nigga you gotta go get yours and make your shit better (C'mon) than the fuckin' last time, nigga fuck

[Verse 1]
All I want for Christmas is 12 gold teeth
A fresh candy blue Jeep, and a four-four heat
I'm pot-headed on some cold streaks
And not a motherfucker wanna hold me, when I'm lonely
So I keep my mind on knockin' shit off the hinges
'Cause the hoes don't speakin' since I lost my ends
And bein' mad at the world ain't the thing to be
But see the world make me feel it's the thing for me
So as a matter of fact, fuck being somethin' else
'Cause I hustle and I struggle by my goddamn self
So what's the way for a young black nigga today?
Rob folks and sell dope that's what I figured you'd say
A nigga wanna put his thang down day-by-day
'Cause my daddy gave me game, nigga play-by-play
He said you gotta make money-money
And if they act funny-funny
Then take money-money-money-money!

[Hook]
So if you got somethin' on your mind
Than make it better than the last time
(Make it better than the last time)
People pass by, sayin' that they wish me well
But in reality I'm knowin' these hoes wish me hell
Shit we design to blow your goddamn mind
Was made better than the last time
(Made better than the last time)
People pass by, sayin' that they wish me well
But in reality I'm knowin' these hoes wish me hell

[Verse 2]
Now can your mind picture me, passin' out from the heat
When it's 20 degrees, full of that gin anger
Leave my fuckin' job at the grocery store
'Cause I be damned if I fall for the [?]
Man, why y'all wanna take the world from a nigga who ain't got shit yet?
But hella game and finna put it in effect
And make it hustlin' steady
'Bout my guns [?]
Toss it if you let me, Young Maxminelli
They tell me playa-haters wish you the worst
But I got fire and I spit first
Hello hearse nigga, no more thirst nigga
No more times, see get your game on the level of mind and we could grind
'Cause when the world on fire all the weed goin' blow
And when you take your last charge you sho' don't know
Now take it slow, all world nigga saggin' low
See get your fuck on and don't forget to ask for mo'
C'mon

[Hook]
And if you got somethin' on your mind
Than make it better than the last time
(Make it better than the last time)
People pass by, sayin' that they wish me well
But in reality I'm (Hold up)

[Verse 3]
Lo and behold, you see me slang dope for the 'cause
A nigga to get a Benz and I can't even get no drawers
Ready to wrap my paws 'round the wheels of a Land Cruiser
Roll with a clique full of straight savage ass pistol shooters
Wanna walk up in the club with a grip and a hoe
So cold and grab the mic and turn that bitch into a icicle
So what's the worst if I wasn't taught
How to upgrade my game and give get a glimpse of life and live it
Give or take a couple a years and we gon' floss
So eat a dick from the next nigga in line to be boss though
I still contact playa-haters on the regular
But layin' low, motherfuckers always ahead of ya
They makes me feel like I got no brain
They wanna snatch me out the game, man, they best to be [?]
But they must be out they goddamn mind
Shit we design to blow your mind was made better than the last time

[Hook]
So if you got somethin' on your mind
Than make it better than the last time
(Make it better than the last time)
People pass by, sayin' that they wish me well
But in reality I'm knowin' these hoes wish me hell
Shit we design to blow your goddamn mind
Was made better than the last time
(Was made better than the last time)
People pass by, sayin' that they wish me well
But in reality I'm knowin' these hoes wish me hell

[Verse 4]
Conjunction, conjuction, nigga what's your malfunction?
Blowin' at you me while you rollin', ain't not future in your frontin'
Let me chill (chill), and sag (sag) and smoke what's left off in this bag
And get bionic as the chronic let me be and let my pants drag
I walked the world and glamor girls like a pimp
[?] me for mobsters, eatin' lobster and shrimp
They can't stop me, Mexican bitches call me papi (sloppy)
Like that y'all, but still a killer comin' at y'all (nigga, huh!)
Hear me say what now, with Maxminelli on the cellular-telly
Hollerin' bout "Mail me my money mane"
Confetti ("You heard me")
International players, runnin' the game world wide
Coolest [?] with a bunny-rabbit on my side, right?
Hoppin' up for the downstroke, while they Pappy play the fiddle
Bitches giggle, shakin' ass til it jiggles
Recitin' my riddles for kibbles, female dogs that blow your mind
But redesign that shit trick and play it "better than the last time"
