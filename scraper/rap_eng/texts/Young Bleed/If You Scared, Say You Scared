(Black)
Yeah Black & Jay, with C-Loc and Young Bleed
Sendin' this out to them old scary ass niggas
Frontin' like they hard, inside them hoes scared

(Jay)
THEM HOES IS SCARED!

(Black)
Nigga if you scared say you scared hoe

First Verse (C-Loc):

Always on beat, Mama told me, be a menace from day one
Wicked ways, son break free, you as real as they come
That's for fun, after dark here come the sun, nowhere to run
Shame before that day I never thought to pray once
As nine's catch me, some stand dazed while foes laughin' at me
Right then I knew to change my ways cuz heaven's startin' to get happy
Askin' where my killers now and hear a sound as I feel the ground
Waitin' for them fools to move the Locster almost drowned
As I make my rounds through the hood the guilty hold their heads down
What you would've did if you could, I don't wanna hear that shit now
Still got love for you, but it's time to flip the format
Now I'm in the club hollerin' "Nigga, where the mic at?"
Well you don't like that, I know playa, you ran like a paperback
Your colors show and now I know there ain't no turnin' back
Take your counterfeit ways to the grave, you lose your head nigga
So if you scared say you scared nigga

Chorus: Black (repeat 2X)

Say you scared nigga, if you scared say you scared nigga
(You ain't scared is ya?)
Eye to eye with a dead nigga
Now if you scared say you scared nigga
(Say you scared nigga!!!!)
Keep your head nigga, you heard what I said nigga?

Second Verse (Young Bleed):

Heart to heart, eye to eye, nigga man to man
Here I stand, starin' at'cha with this thing in my hand
Killer Corleone, like you know, Killer Corleone, not a
Nigga in the World, I run with thieves like Ali Baba
That'll take your life
Trife like a thief in the night
And use the little bit on money they make, gettin' high as a kite
Shit gone be alright though, I ain't trippin'
Constantly flippin' but quick to issue niggas ass whippins
No love for enemies from Baton Rouge to Tennessee
Me and Black & Jay, sippin' Hennessey say pass it Jay
Nigga quick to blast away
Any day, so what now?
Call it what you want but nigga, I don't give a fuck, hanh?
Niggas ain't ready for confetti, four fingers gone like Freddy
Eatin' spaghetti it's who nigga?  Corleone
I'm home in my own zone, don't cross my path and make me laugh
Dirty ass nigga, here's your blood bath, ya heard me?
Consider me a soldier of fortune, a hustler
Quick to take your life while you're checkin' the muffler
Nigga you fuckin' with a black hand Killa clan, goin' off wit'cha head
So if you scared, won't you say you scared nigga?

Chorus

Third Verse (Black):

Nigga if you scared, say you scared, look in my eyes you not bout it
Drop your head or run off, before this shit start gettin' rowdy
Nigga you scared to die, frontin' like you got heart in this game
Thought you was a true ass thug nigga, ready to ride and bust thangs
See how things change when it's time to ride
Oh now your pen allbleedin
No nuts inside the draws, I know his niggas feelin' me
I'm on this hennessey and weed, strap it up and let's mob
Get these true niggas off the corner and lets go  finish the job
These niggas that ride they some hoes, inside them niggas really scared
Quick to leave you niggas dead if you heard what I said
From Tennessee to Baton Rouge, ain't no love for these fakes
So many niggas that perpetrate, scared to hold they own weight
Won't hesitate to pull that trigger I look you dead in your eyes
Regrettin' what'cha ass did, scared beggin' for your life
You should've thought about it nigga, actin' like you really cared
Now the shoes on the other foot, go on and say that'cha scared

Chorus

Fourth Verse (Jay):

I ain't scared to die or get high
I ain't scared to see the bitch bleed
When it's time to mob I'm gone ride bitch
And shit done changed cuz when I go to war, you can lose your brain
Cuz I'm bad from them streets, quick to pull them thangs
Ain't it a shame?  From what respect you get for killin' a nigga?
Because his nuts wasn't bigger, left him dead in his Hilfiger
How much slicker learn quicker from true Mob figures
Like Gotti and Nitty, C-Loc and Bleed and Black & Jay on the picture
Now who's wit'cha?  When it's time to kick up dust, when it's a must?
To let them toys bust, over bullshit stuff
It's rough, and times are hard on these crooked ass streets
And if you fuck with my clique, we leave 'em six feet deep
Hellbound and Southbound, like Eightball and MJG lay it down
From those who wanna clown, we bury they faces to the ground
I'm on the pitcher's mound, ready to strike the next opponent out
And if you scared, say you scared, bitch open your mouth

Chorus
