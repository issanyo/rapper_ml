[Verse 1]
Imagine riding in the dark with no heart
Where bodies lay and trigger spray paint is an art
Swamped in it from start, as two depart
From that you're dying to flex
Head and chest, so protect your life with a vest
As I confess deadly sins, born again
Through the hearts of murder men
Since the age of ten been tryin' to stay out the pen
And ain't no friends in the game, they died young
Where I'm from you get hung
Incarcerated while the rest lay numb
To Kingdom Come from the ghetto
I tell the story with more nuts than glory
For my peers in purgatory, tryin' not to worry
Get 'em off in a hurry, back to my ride
To the other side, where my homies died
And they mommas cry, get it?
(Niggas give a fuck if you big)
That's how it be but I don't mean no harm
But any fool that disagree with me wave your arm
Enough said, I'm misled walkin' around half dead
Broke and unfed, trippin' off voices in my head
They hollerin' 'bout...

[Hook]
Ghostrider, tell me how you feel
Do you really got the balls to get your cap peeled?
Them niggas ain't that real, totin' steel with murder skills to kill
You ride for me, I'll ride for you. We'll keep it real, though
Makin' a key

[Verse 2]
I pack a pistol when I ride
Havin' thoughts of suicide and homicide, while my brain collide
Let it ride on my positive side
And keep flippin' and watch him die
Feel the negative vibes for set trippin'
Ha ha, see me laughin' like a nickel platin' up
Mad doggin' all of y'all 'cause I just don't give a fuck
Playin' it rough with no regards for the law
And they gets the buck and doin' bitch
Like the last outlaw, fatal flaw
In a ball of confusion niggas picture me losing
With my back against the wall with no conclusion
Still refusing to die
Don't, pretend to fuck, to the murder show
I'll be liquor step, plan it like you go
'Cause you never know
And everyday could be your last day
Smokin' blunts, flickin' ashes in your ashtray
With a pistol full of lead, when the light turns green
Steady trippin' off them voices in my head
They hollerin' 'bout...

[Hook]
Ghostrider, tell me how you feel
Do you really got the balls to get your cap peeled?
Them niggas ain't that real, totin' steel with murder skills to kill
You ride for me, I'll ride for you. We'll keep it real, though
Makin' a key

[Verse 3]
I wonder why, I live to see the killers cry
Muggin' without a tear in my eye
But if I die ask my father up in heaven Pop, take me wit you
I forgive them all because they know not what they do
Just set me free and let me flee with a smile
Like every ghetto born child
Ever since a juvenile, been know for liftin', buckin' 'em wild
With a murderous style, wonder why
Wanna murder me mama
With this delay and misconceptions got me lost in the jungle
They say they'll offer me up
With those who thump and survive
They always light paper and put his name on the wall
Rest in peace here lies the thug
Who run the  high school halls
Without no meaner that fell a victim to a murder cop
Back in the block
After the bury him and life goes on
Stuck in a daze tryin' to figure out what's right and what's wrong
Singin' that same song, trying to balance close to the edge
Steady trippin' off them voices in my head
