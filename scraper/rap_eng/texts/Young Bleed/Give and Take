Hey yo, turn the headphones up a lil' bit

[Verse 1]
Yo, ain't no mistakes, this a give and take
And if you know like I know, you gotta live the breaks
Coming out a dope-infested, unprotected
Ghetto lifestyle with killer crime records
I make it a point to understand this ain't wonderland
It's either kill or be killed, law of the land
Just to see that my mind expand
Rapidly I can't lose sleep, I stay on my feet
And flip enough to eat, yo
Ain't nothing sweet when milk money ain't enough to feed the tummy
We mummified in this land of milk and honey
Home of the never free, become ghetto celebrities
Living in jeopardy, playa, knowing some will never be
Take it in stride, thats how we ride through the streets where I'm from
Trying to get some, hoping for the big one
Seven figures and them some, make it and spend some
Hustling, with the man steady taking your income
Ya heard me?

[Hook x2]
See you win some, you lose some
And then you spend some on 'em when you choose 'em
See it's a cold world, and it's a cold game
But if you learn the give and take it ain't no thang

[Verse 2]
Nigga break bread with me, stay ahead with me
And if you're loyal then you know you're going fed with me
Say it with me, and play it with me rugged raw style
Respect my mind, I'm looking nothing like your pa's child
You know I let the beats bang and slowly do my thang
If you can't hang then say you can't hang nigga
What I deliver will give 'em shivers in the night time
And I ain't trippin' I just write rhymes, about my lifetime
How I stand secure when the pressure endured
While the rest fall off they ain't sure
To mimick my methods I won't accept it if the truth ain't you
I watch 'em die in disguise wicked as voodoo
Niggas holler who, what, where, and when you wanna try
Know you're dealing with a hustler living it do or die
Don't ask why, my nigga this just fate
In this life we live, you gotta give and take
That's how it operate

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm running from the ONE-TIME, summer in the city
Where the girls look good, but they attitudes shitty
With a fifty sack of sticky bailing up G Street
Through the corner projects holding my heat
I heard they took my partner out the game last week
We come from the same streets now they trying to blast me
More money more murder, I'm cold-blooded and these hoes love it
But thats the quickest downfall and I'm for sho' of it
It's like time keep on slippin' and niggas keep trippin'
So I keep a nine with the clip in
Holstered up hot and heated
You can think it's a game but come and see it to believe it though
You ain't know? I'm representin' out that dirty-dirty
Southside nigga living untrustworthy
You heard me, where word be wicked and raw
Said and done, and nigga fuck what you saw
You know, for sho'

[Hook x2]
