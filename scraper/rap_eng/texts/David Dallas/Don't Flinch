[Intro]
Gee I dunno
Go rack us some fucking coke from countdown
Fuck don't be a dropnutz

[Verse: David Dallas]
Yep, yep
They say the hard hitting never learn
You said to hell with that
My name will forever burn
And the history of this town and the next
Got a fresh batch of ink tatted on his neck
Don't recollect when we met
But we can't have been much older than thirteen
Had some growing dreams of being pros on the deck
Had a birdhouse
We used to mock peoples gear
We were the worst out
Turned out a little different from him to me
Cos' even then he dealt with things that we didn't see
And little me I could leave well enough alone
But not him if he felt that disrespect was shown
Let it be known he was swinging on you on site
Going for broke, we'd be breaking it up
Trying to tell him its just jokes
He'd be like I'm not fucking laughing, fuck that cunt
No affect must've been a [?]
Threw that punch
Even if his face swell up
Still ready to scrap if one of his dudes boys tries to bowl up
Ain't no hold up nah
Ain't no hold up sway
Still remember getting told one day


[Chorus: David Dallas]
Don't flinch, tell em' don't flinch
If you get the news, no tears, don't act like a bitch
Tell em' don't flinch, don't flinch
If the drama comes we ain't never giving up an inch
Don't flinch, don't flinch
If you get the news, no tears, don't act like a bitch
Tell em' don't flinch, don't flinch
If the drama comes, then drama comes
That's what it is, that's what it is

[Verse: David Dallas]
That's what it is
Got himself a couple kids
Ain't even twenty three
Knows what the struggle is
Young missus at home, while he's working double shifts
Tryna' make end's meat, tryna' cover it
Seems like this whole Dad thing mellowed him out
Used to tell me fuck this underground shit start selling out
Get this money cos' you never know what's round the corner
Fuck being cool, cool doesn't feed your daughter
Said aight bro tell me to keep in touch
But right then is when we started not seeing much
I guess there was things he would keep from us
If I could go back then i'd tell him start speaking up
Words starts leaking that his old ladys pretty sick
Keep it on the low
Maybe him and his middy splif
Maybe I should take a trip round
No answer at the front door
So let myself in through the lounge
Heard a bit of sound coming from the kitchen
Like glass bottles being put down and Nelly on the system
When it came inner vision
Bros alone at the table with like half the house missing
Said she left and took the kids to a fam' in Gizbin
Hole in the wall where's has probably been kicked in
Looking like a time bomb ticking
Off his head talking bout' how he's not tripping
Saying he could never be a victim
I man handles his problems on his own
He don't need no one to fix em'
I said asking for help is ok
He looked me in the eyes and I remembered that thing he used to say

[Chorus: David Dallas]
Don't flinch, tell em' don't flinch
If you get the news, no tears, don't act like a bitch
Tell em' don't flinch, don't flinch
If the drama comes we ain't never giving up an inch
Don't flinch, Don't flinch
If you get the news, no tears, don't act like a bitch
Tell em' don't flinch, don't flinch
If the drama comes, then drama comes
That's what it is, that's what it is
