Stay prepared for the up and downs, life is like a see-saw
Some say it? s a bitch, man I couldn? t agree more
One minute you? re on top, then you? re in the ER
One minute she wants you, then she wants to leave all
All I can do is take the good with the bad and keep on
Gotta work hard, gotta give the fans the mean songs
Give these programmers more shit that they can sleep on
Give these biting cunts more shit that they can feast on
Money come and go out your life like the seasons
People do too sometimes without a reason
And it kind of seamed wrong when they took his life
Should of killed this dude, he? s a fucking dick right
And maybe get some insight from jesus, ala, jehova
Some will prey on Sunday some will spend it hung over
Whether drunk or sober, house is getting colder, globe is getting warmer
Maybe thats some karma for real
CHORUS
Woke up feeling down, now I? m feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But till tomorrow, till tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Pay day I? m quits, next...
Sittin? on my bed wondering why I bother for
But till tomorrow, till tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Most people all talk, no action
Over that shit and numerate it to a fraction
Maybe on the internet having little word wars
Typing in their 2 cents acting like it? s worth more
Tell you how to surf, when they? ve never touched a surfboard
Dissing Tiger Woods when they? re fucking even worse whores
You get the urge wanna go and call them out
Making you just as bad as them by all accounts
And what it amounts to ain? t shit
Working at a slave ship hit by the same whip as the person that you? re arguing with
A lot of people there to arguing about all remain...
Say laters to this try focus on your own life then you see haters with no homies no lights
Make you grateful for what you have but got to make you wonder if you really are giving what you can
CHORUS
Woke up feeling down, now I? m feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But till tomorrow, till tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Pay day I? m quits, next...
Sittin? on my bed wondering why i bother for
But till tomorrow, till tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
[Russell Brand]
We all wake up and go oh I ain't I? m not 18 anymore
You know I? m in my thirties, but so what at least I got my health
If you haven? t got your health, if you? ve got one leg
At least I haven? t got 2 legs missing, and if you have lost both legs and both arms
Just go at least I? m not dead, I can? t be dead
CHORUS
Woke up feeling down, now I? m feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But till tomorrow, till tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Pay day I? m quits, next...
Sittin? on my bed wondering why i bother for
But till tomorrow, till tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
