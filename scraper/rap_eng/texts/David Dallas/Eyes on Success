[Hook: Buff1 & David Dallas]
We got our eyes on success, mind on our goals
Making ends meet that's how the money folds
On the road doing shows, when it comes to how it goes we the pro's
We gotta stay level headed yeah, vision in the clouds
So world wide so we make our cities proud
Yeah we make our cities proud
And we want the finest things we allowed

[Verse 1: Buff 1]
Got a lot on my mind, need a lot in my pocket
Mike E gave me a shot and I shot like a rocket
Now I'm popping with models no sir rocking my bottles
My main thing so grown she be rocking my scado
You're just toddlers that follow whatever rappers say
Well I'm a rapper I say go to school and graduate
Hey if it's an ends to a means
If you got another plan man stick to your dreams
I know we all can't afford tuition in a school system like the ? fool wishing
But just know that success comes in the mind first
Shoot for the stars with guns blazing like Wyatt Earp
No matter the turf or the country that I rhyme
In that like mind this shine like high priced diamonds
And if you're realising what the nice life is
You can get us in the city for the right prices

[Hook]

[Verse 2: David Dallas]
My head to the asphalt, sipping on Jack though
Impressing chicks that ain't ever been to a rap show
She's trying to be down, she saying I got a mad flow
I see right through her I ain't trying to be sad though
It's all good though, we don't discriminate
She bumps George FM on the dinner dates
Dates swear deuces all into Real Estate
But this shit right here they can't imitate
It's the Bad Boy thing like Puff and B.I.G had
Can't You See, didn't Total sing that?
Really off the hook and I ain't gonna ring back
This retro classic's something to bring back
Always on that '80s shit, that some ladies shit
Me and Buff on that crazy shit
Aim high for the type of cash you can buy Mercedes with
In fact people in the ? that's for real

[Hook]
