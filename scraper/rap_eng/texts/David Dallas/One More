You ain't gotta say no more
We ain't tryna break no more
We're just tryna hear one more
Bring her back, baby goes
You ain't gotta say no more
We ain't tryna break no more
We're just tryna hear one more
Bring her back, baby goes

Sometimes'll be a long night after a long day
You should take a picture and start pouring out that Bombay
Mix it with that tonic water, then let's just relax
Getting in my one's addictive, I'm bout to relapse
This is NZ drinking culture running though these veins
Got a South Aucks Education running through my brain
Used to fuck that damn native DMC chains
Nowadays I come from rock with a lot of these lames
That they plan when I'm stepping out, you's tryna step me out
Play some cool shit I know the words
And they look out the fool
Really ain't my fault that you're a square you step it up
After 3 AM just don't bother tryna get in touch
Feeling like I'm super groove cause now I can't get enough
Dudes probably need a fully cover they can't get no luck
With the girls in here, but before I leave
If I can't tell the DJ to play another jam

You ain't gotta say no more
We ain't tryna break no more
We're just tryna hear one more
Bring her back, baby goes
You ain't gotta say no more
We ain't tryna break no more
We're just tryna hear one more
Bring her back, baby goes

There they go, there they go
Call me long hole Dita
There's sun on the horizon and there's gonna be seeing me all
I've been off of this bourbon so for certain I'll be down
For whatever wanna trust I'm feeling a little more underground
Swear that we don't fuck around, treat this nightclub like my lawn
Boot this DJ, plug the iPhone and play my own sound
And on that note pulsing on my chest
Stepped up in this bitch with my hat low
Dudes are '.next getting up tight
Cuffing up the women tryna whisper to them some light
Girl I'm just one guard, don't get yourself tongue tied
Really explain it made it on the blood line
Out here tryna on one cause I'm worth for it just like you did
Bet yo girl just recognize me like I was the Nike tip
You see that exit bro, squish just do it
One more tune before we'

You ain't gotta say no more
We ain't tryna break no more
We're just tryna hear one more
Bring her back, baby goes
You ain't gotta say no more
We ain't tryna break no more
We're just tryna hear one more
Bring her back, baby goes
