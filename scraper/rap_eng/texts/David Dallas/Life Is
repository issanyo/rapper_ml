[Verse 1]
From the pacific island of Samoa via Middlemore
And still as raw as the day a little boy was delivered on
Deliver non-fiction all real, no silicon
Been sitting on a goldmine the way I been killing songs
Underdog, but ain't trying to play this position long
The top cats is looking weak, but I feel gorilla strong
Ain't kidding dog King Kong ain't got shit on me
Word to Curren$y I'm flying but ain't got weed on me
You can catch me on a long haul
Riding Air New Zealand or Qantas
Me and Che hit the states with no sponsors
And accomplished more than more these fuckhead labels did
Even though they had untold grinds to pay for shit
Pushing trash indie bands whose resume's paper thin
That play South By once then never play again
I play to win, put money on the line I don't have
Then say "fuck it if I fail it ain't so bad"
Being broke, I'd rather take a risk than be a joke
Who thinks he's really living life when he ain't leaving home
I'm trying to see the world they just trying to meet some girls
And get in the club for free for a weekend splurge
See how quick they on my dick when I reemerge
On some Jean Grae shit, they just real gay pricks
D dot D A bitch, say it with authority
People asking what's good, I'm in that minority
You thinking music sucks now, they're in that majority
Ain't in no fraternity they probably in sororities
And we don't even have those where I'm from
People say the clocks ticking down 'til I blow up
I'm a time bomb but
Great stories don't always get told, ask Saigon
I just hope these songs click with people like a Nikon
Ironic, ’cause for that I need for them to click the icon
Hit the ‘Save As’ menu button, yeah the right one
Burn a fuckin' CD, chuck it on your Ipod
Play it in your car, this some shit you can vibe on
Shouts to Adidas, it's been a while since I had Nikes on
And anybody else who helped the bro to keep the lights on, yeah

[Outro: David Brent]
Life is just a series of peaks and troughs
And you don't know whether you're in a trough until you're climbing out
Or on a peak until you're coming down
That's it; you know, you'll never know what's around the corner, but it's all good, you know
"If you want the rainbow, you'll have to put up with the rain"
You know which 'philosopher' said that?
Dolly Parton. And people say she's just a big pair of tits
