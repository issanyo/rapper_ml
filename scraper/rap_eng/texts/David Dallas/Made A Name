Air miles clocked up
Bank account topped up
We made a name off of this

Flows on the trap
Put clothes on my back
Shit, we made a name off of this

Made the people back home proud
Sold a couple shows out
We ain't gonna change up a bit

Just being famous for nothing ain't shit
Man we made a name off of this

No sell out, no compromise at all
Still the same as the way I came in
No mighty morph
Passed up on every fad
That they got excited for
Try and write it off
But they thing is kinda off
Time's always gonna tell
You can check the dialogue
I'm not known for antics
I'm known for writing fire songs
Don't come with memes
I don't try to be no funny guy
Writing little sub tweets
Hoping that no one replies
That's some bitch shit
All I do is fuckin rhyme
Wife is something fine
Got her on the other line
So don't waste my fuckin time
Too many dudes with no guts
And a rubber spine
Scared to do their own thing
So they sit and wonder why
Kanye can touch the sky
And they can't
Always focused on what ain't art
And fake charts
Come up with the same bars
Fuck a format
I didn't come to take part
Came to take over William Wallace
I'm a Brave heart
Rep for them people out there
Who come from the same part
Had the same start
Could be doing some Mondaine task
For minimum wage hard labour pushing freight carts
A new Subaru is as close as we get to a racecar
So dudes like Mike Hosking
Can keep they face glassed
And now walk straight past
And not see a damn thing
Ray Charles, they used to it
Cause all they do is look the other way
Out of touch with the people I see every other day
Not tryin to help but always seem to have so much to say
About where the tax payer's dollars should be paid
And how you should behave
How your parents could've saved
Poor people should've made
How the government has done enough
How much should it take?
Swear they did it on their own
With a smug lookin face
Too dumb to recognize the luck and privilege put in place
I'm on a tangent but this is chance I couldn't waste
Couldn't wait, never really could embrace
Stuff that was so watered down that I couldn't taste
What I would've gave to hear someone else
Tell it in a way that I could relate
Over heartbeats that's way the hood relates
Music that nobody could replace
So fuck what you got paid off of
Got laid off of
Got played off of
This right here is what we made a name off of

Air miles clocked up
Bank account topped up
We made a name off of this

Flows on the trap
Put clothes on my back
Shit, we made a name off of this

Made the people back home proud
Sold a couple shows out
We ain't gonna change up a bit

Just being famous for nothing ain't shit
Man we made a name off of this

"How different I'd be, and I probably would've remained very traditional. And most important of all to me, I would not discovered another world. And that world is, another language, the English language in this case. By adopting another language, I was adopting another way of looking at the world and others. Because when you acquire a language you acquire another way to see"
