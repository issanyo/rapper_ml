*Liam Gallagher*
Because they obviously think they're too big and they obviously think they're bigger than the bands and fuck 'em. if they're not prepared to give you a decent sound so they can go and suck my cock

Chorus 2x
I feel like Oasis in 1995
Getting so wasted
Saying what’s on my mind
You should embrace it
Fuck all the fake shit
Telling everybody we're the best
Into their faces

*David Dallas*
I am feeling like Liam and Noel
Laced my Adidas' on strong
Never been scared to commit when everyone's feet getting cold
Me, I'm not worried at all, believe on my own talent
Not sharing the spotlight with them, I got no manners
Dudes are just no challenge, not striking, no balance
Either their beats whack or their rhymes all flow so average
I'm leavin' them like blur ??? shattered
You are hearing me killing shit, stop watching me toe tag it
Tryin' to be bigger than Lindsay Lohan's coke habit
So when I hit the stage your girl throw her clothes at it
You should take notes damn it, jammin' this Lennon and McCartney
Fuck all the false modesty, media can't harm me
Sayin what I wanna say, aiming for the top spot
Don't leave me for having everything that they have not got
Understand the reasons why they have to try and cock block
Supersonic of this gin and tonic, I do not stop

Chorus 2x
I feel like Oasis in 1995
Getting so wasted
Saying what’s on my mind
You should embrace it
Fuck all the fake shit
Telling everybody we're the best
Into their faces

*Tayyib Ali*
Okay, I'm popping is crazy, niggas say that I am loco
Now I'm fresh in SoHo, them ladies snappin' my photo
Hit the gas on a ride, they wanna act like I told you
I'll put my key in, we'll be eatin', couple spins and it's over
Yo, I will be getting it in, all my Philly shit chillin'
Yeah I grind by the hour but I've been hot for a minute
I'm just out for the day, puffin' and playing
Spending this money, we're doing the same
Crushin' the game, your girlfriend, she leaving ??? see her again
Yeah. That's something I can't control and there's one thing that I know
(what)
I am always on the roll, trying blow
Yeah I'm ten steps ahead, niggas better catch up instead of beefing for the bread
This shit ??? and I don't even try hard
In a good position so I got to pay my part
That young nigga from Philly you got your style from
Nineteen but I need thousands

Chorus 2x
I feel like Oasis in 1995
Getting so wasted
Saying what’s on my mind
You should embrace it
Fuck all the fake shit
Telling everybody we're the best
Into their faces

*The Kid Daytona*
The rap version oasis, crowd surfing on stages
Raging with machines, got my beats from a basement
Places that I grace my presence with
Outside American show me love, though I'm a ???
Left a print on my hand
???
Roll my name graffiti on a tram
Come and greet me when I land
Of this cloud I'm presently on
Every morning thank the heavenly lord
??? could really think of any
Now that she left ..
Smoking a cigar .. on a show
.. anywhere in the world ..
Shout out to D dot Dallas, an MC, that's how we stylin' from NY to AZ

Chorus 2x
I feel like Oasis in 1995
Getting so wasted
Saying what’s on my mind
You should embrace it
Fuck all the fake shit
Telling everybody we're the best
Into their faces
