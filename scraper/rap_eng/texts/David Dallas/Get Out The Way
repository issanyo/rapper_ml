[Verse]
Make room, there ain't no fakin my mood
Feel i'm the greatest, no bull. s
Ain't breakin into a sweat, nah this ain't no duet
This is D.Dot, at his finest
P.I, Mama side, plus the white dad you'll find me
That's the make-up I'll be reppin till I'm dead
Plus I spit that ill shit that be fuckin with yo head
And I'm also way ahead of the pack
Got the vans on, peter pannin out in Japan and gotta get them cans of
Chu-Hi-i-i chillin with S.Hansen, now Mmboppin we get it poppin
Stop them where their hands are.. up in the air, they, up in the air
Everything just ain't what it appears, but this is
I'm really the shit kid, so fricken addictive
Sick, truth hurts, no quik in this it's just Nicholas and me
The best 1-2 since, Tyson hit up Michael Spinx
Go go sit up on your fence, I'mma piss upon it hence

[Bridge]
Woah shit, run it down, foes take cover now
If you on the come up pal, this is how it's goin down

[Chorus]
Rush, rush we movin on up up you on my lane
Get out the way, la da da da da day hey
Plus, plus nobody but us us does it the same
Get out the way, la da da da da day hey
Don't tell me to fall back, I'll creep through the back door
I'll climb through the window, it's locked, i'm breakin the latch cause
We live for the day
Get out the way, la da da da da day hey
Get out the way, la da da da da day hey

[Verse]
Yeah yeah my peoples, this heres the sequel
I'm T2 with the rhymin, James Cameron my vibe and
These days i reside in the M.A call it the mount
Still carry that drive all up in me, call it the south
Aucks mindstate I recall, them old spacies at Bob's
I come straight off the Corner of Hunters, I was born
To chase game and win, place it in my aim
A sore loser i play to win, David is the name, plain

[Bridge]
Woah shit, run it down, foes take cover now
If you on the come up pal, this is how it's goin down

[Chorus]
Rush, rush we movin on up up you on my lane
Get out the way, la da da da da day hey
Plus, plus nobody but us us does it the same
Get out the way, la da da da da day hey
Don't tell me to fall back, I'll creep through the back door
I'll climb through the window, it's locked, i'm breakin the latch cause
We live for the day
Get out the way, la da da da da day hey
Get out the way, la da da da da day hey
