[Intro]
I got the new world in my view
On my journey I pursue
I said I'm running, running for the city
I got the new world in my view
I got the new world in my view
On my journey I pursue
Lord said I'm running, running for the city
I got the new world in my view

[Verse 1]
They ain't got no muscle, no hustle
No backbone, I stand alone
Not tripping, just saying, I'm different
Ain't hanging on the coattails of the next man
Passport in my left hand, thinking that you got next
Heck, hope you ain't holding your breath, man
Cause I'm out here, I'm hungry, I don't play around, trust me
Ain't hexed my drive since my Honda Civic got rusty
And my girl said she loved me, it's funny
Just thinking back, study hard for that 9 to 5
Like I thought that I'd be good with that
I was dreaming, still dreaming, spoil it on me like Willie Beaman
Still performing like Al Pacino, we stuck around in tuxedos
With my peoples, we growing up 'stead of seeing others slowing up
Tint squad, we throwing up, every time we showing up

[Chorus]
Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with you now
They don’t wanna give it up
We gon' make it out
Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with them, yeah
They don't wanna give it up
We don't make them ask it

[Verse 2]
It don't get no greater, feel like I'm on fire
Feel like I'm Johnny Storm, feel like I'm volatile
Explosive, get close enough to notice
Your girl act out of character when she see me approaching
Ain't poaching I'm just saying it's nothing
You punching above your weight, I'm something
She ain't seen no substitute in that A team
That's B.A., Baracus, that BS, that whackness
Get no play in my axis, make 'em jump like AJ Hackett
Guarantee you in these boots they couldn't walk one mile
I really need to go and hang it up like a drunk dial
So behind the times they should probably rock a sundial
Shattering their dreams, I could make Big Pun smile
Music from the soul, don't need them to help me
If they fiending for the flash, they should take another selfie
Said I'm running, I'm running like Mo Farah, so dapper
Swear the whole world could go against me, it don't matter, man

[Chorus]
Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with you now
They don’t wanna give it up
We gon' make it out
Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with them, yeah
They don't wanna give it up
We don't make them ask it

[Bridge]
I'm on the chase
Won't wait another day
My plan is falling into place
We ain't got much to lose
I wanna taste
Won't wait another day
My plan is falling into place
We ain't got much to lose

[Chorus]
Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with you now
They don’t wanna give it up
We gon' make it out
Get it while I'm living
All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking
So I'm 'bout my business
And I'm running, I'm running
I'm running with them, yeah
They don't wanna give it up
We don't make them ask it
