[Verse 1]

Young and thirsty for some recognition
Sittin' up at Manukau talkin' to the girls like they were women
Just a boy tryna' be a man
Tryna' keep it pimping
Dreaming of a life with no inhibitions
Not just tryna' fit in
I'm tryna' be the one they notice, talkin' 'bout
Me and ? rubbin' shoulders, talkin' 'bout
Me turnin' heads up at Hunter's Corner
Way before we could turn the club into a fuckin' sauna
I knew that I wanted something like that
I wanna' fuckin' shine
Don't want to stand in the queue, I wanna' jump the line
Now when I hit the night spots bouncers know the time
Now when I drop a new flow people know it's mine
Did you notice I'm comin' off a little brash
You would say I beat the odds if you did the math
Same people used to front, now tryna' kiss my ass
Yellin' out "Aye D.D"

[Hook]

Shit reminds me of the old days
I'm gettin' back to my old ways
Used to really want a gold chain, mean gears, new car
And everyone to know who we are
Does my name ring a bell now?

Does my name ring a bell now?

Does my name ring a bell now?
Like *bring* ding, dong
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Guess some things don't ever change
Guess some things don't ever change
So tell me, does my name ring a bell now?
Talkin' like ring, ding, dong
If it don't it will before long
Does my name ring a bell now?

[Verse 2]

Couple years back it was the worst
December 13th, still tryna' find a gig for the 31st
Actin' like they never heard a verse
Booking agents saying that it's quiet, you might have to look for work
You might have to switch it up
Fr-enemies droppin' hints
Maybe this shit ain't for you
Maybe you should give it up
Maybe I'm just crazy and refuse to admit it
But fuck it, go grab the credit card it's time to push the limit up
Got a couple bills past due, need the quicker bucks
Me and Shea had a plan, all we need's a little luck
Fast-forward four years, now it's a different buzz
Her runnin' so much, I'm gettin' sick of us
Seein' rave reviews gettin' written up
Gotta mention me if you talkin' 'bout who's rippin' up
Gotta know the name, can't act like you don't give a fuck
Shit is no biggie but I still gotta hit 'em up

[Bridge]

I hold that on my mind
24/7, that's three-six-five
Papatoe from the oh-nine ?
When you see me out now you know

[Hook]

Shit reminds me of the old days
I'm gettin' back to my old ways
Used to really want a gold chain, mean gears, new car
And everyone to know who we are
Does my name ring a bell now?

Does my name ring a bell now?

Does my name ring a bell now?
Like *bring* ding, dong
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Does my name ring a bell now?

Does my name ring a bell now?

Does my name ring a bell now?
Talkin' like ring, ding, dong
If it don't it will before long
Does my name ring a bell now?
