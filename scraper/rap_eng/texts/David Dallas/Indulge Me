[Verse]
Ooooh, what a night this eve
With the homies Jordache and Aaron on the beat
It’s the C-O-N I, ain't come to play around
Steady tryna think, of a place we can take it now
Take it real slow, tryna be respectful too
So I just suggest it to you like
Do you wanna come sit over here and chill
See I got a friend that’ll serve us drinks until
He gets off, I kinda think that you’d be best off
Riding this thing out, there’ll be less cost
For you, and for me I get the bonus the best view
But I put the onus against you, no stress tho
You can make your mind up, what you wanna do
I’m doin me with this heineken, till the night is done
But theres no denyin I like your company
[Hook x2]
Can I get ya name and ya number say
Can I get a smile on ya face I’d pay
For a drink or two just get to know me
Don’t leave, no no no you gotta indulge me
[Verse]
Take a sip, go ahead
Nah I won’t take advantage if it go to your head
I’m opposed to that red wine
Just a little bit of that for me is bedtime
Won’t get ahead of myself
I’m tellin you i’m in for the long haul
Till the fat lady, singin the encore
On tour ? oh you really wanna know
See I don’t think you do, you just really wanna show
That you ain’t no, no no young h-o
Tryna hook up anything that’s in the place tho
No you ain’t gotta worry bout that
Cause if I thought it, I wouldn’t really sit around and chat
So just sit around and lap
The attention up, and don’t worry ain’t nobody gotta mention us
That ascension buzz cause we on the up and up
So when you see me lookin maybe you could pucker up
[Hook x2]
Can I get ya name and ya number say
Can I get a smile on ya face I’d pay
For a drink or two just get to know me
Don’t leave, no no no you gotta indulge me
[Bridge]
It seems you’ve been playing around
Tryna figure out, how I get down
But you know, know
It’s sweet if you stay right here
You got no idea
But I’ll show you though, I hope you know
[Hook x2]
Can I get ya name and ya number say
Can I get a smile on ya face I’d pay
For a drink or two just get to know me
Don’t leave, no no no you gotta indulge me
