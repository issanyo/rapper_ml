Yea, I said it's D dot, D-A double L-A-S, she just thinking L-M-F-A-O
Tell that she ain't well impressed
Cause we ain't on telly yet
Ain't getting those spins like rihanna umbrella yet
So she acting celibate
But I'm in my element, I don't take that shit to heart
I like proving them wrong just to make myself look smart
They see the future as a blur to me it's looking sharp
'cos my moneys on me you should get in from the start
So we order 4 shots of raw Jager while the bottle pours
Think a flowers gotta fear, when you know you got it all
'Cause we on the bottom floor looking at the top and all
People say we crazy but they just bet on all the bores
They just wanna wish for all things to fall on to their lap
I'm on a mission for it I won't sit and pause until it happens
Baby quit your chitter, chatter, yap and kick back and handle the shot
In a couple years you won't believe you met us in the spot

You should take a picture, (ca chick)
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit
And say this, you were down when they weren't
When no one gave a damn what we did
Here we are pouring out shots at the bar
Swearing one day we'll be stars
Take a flick before the worlds up on this shit

Take a flick, remember it in a couple years when you see dudes
Resembling us
Then run and tell your friends that you met us and it was nuts
We pour some drinks and partied 'til the sun came up
See it ain't even a thing that we ain't even a bang
And I ain't really no singer, ain't really no king
I'm just a simple man thats tryna do really big things
From the land of flightless birds, bout to grow really big wings
And girl I really do think that the truth come out the more that we drink
Wouldn't tell you this stuff otherwise I'd probably feel stink
But you caught me on an off day, or is it an on day
Shit, I don't even know it's been a long day
Driving past the bombay, plus one for my lady friend
Make a mental note of this things won't be the same again
When you see us our names again they gonna be up in lights
But now the rest is history for now it's just another night

So take a picture, (ca chick)
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit
And say this, you were down when they weren't
When no one gave a damn what we did
Here we are pouring out shots at the bar
Swearing one day we will be stars
Take a flick before the worlds up on this shit
