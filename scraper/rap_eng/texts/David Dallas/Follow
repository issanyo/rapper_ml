David dallas (verse 1)

Yea if you come from where we come from
No we dont ever run from
Gettin money in a lump sum just to pay it back later
If the family need a favour then it ain't nothin major
Paper changes hands quicker then a dj hits the fader
Thats just how we do how we grew hard to understand
That as a sour youth mum explainin that you ain't allowed to choose
Your family's your family they gonna look out for you
Still a samoan boy dont forget about your roots
Growin up in AK where they dont forget their rugby boots
Didn't play much five-eighth i would play way more kurupt
And snoop play way more mobb deep boom boom say hey all my people who
Been goin against the grain but dont forget bout why we really do
What we do where we came from got our names from
People i lay next to in the ground when my day comes
Chance to make my music a gift for me that they brung
Think i ain't proud then you mistaken uce

David dallas (hook)

Thats just how we do how we're raised island roots auckland ways
People overseas wonder if i'll ever change
But i came from the future
Today is tomorrow
Thats why what ever we do
Then the world gonna follow (3x)
Celebrate it with my fam
Feel like we just hit the lotto
The world gonna follow (2x)
Man i came from NZ my today is their tomorrow

David dallas (verse 2)

I got dem laid back island genes
I dont need no drama
In my ie lavalava listenin to dear mama
With my peers sippin lagers reminiscin on the years
Made a tears that we shed for the departed disappeared
So for real rod see you when i get there
I still got some things that i need to tackle bout to get my headgear like im Thurston or Kronfeld man im certain
If things round here were perfect
Feel i'd be half the person
I was birthed in Middlemore for a reason
On any day in auckland could see all four seasons
So we're born believen the sky ain't the limit its just somethin to react to
Things are lookin cloudy now but the sun will crack through
Umbrella packed too you can read it like im tattoed
Proud of where im from it pulls me back like
A lasso laugh how we used to pay for sky before the rent
This that hamo that palagi pito saute aukilagi shit

Hook (2x)
