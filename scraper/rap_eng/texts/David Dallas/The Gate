[Verse 1 - David Dallas]

It's so hard to say goodbye, pretend I'm yawning to hide these tears in my eyes I'm just tired right
Its an early flight I had a late night packing up, couple files I was backing up
Let's not start acting up, it's tough enough as it is
If I don't go I can't say that I lived and it'd be impossible to forgive
Myself if I don't try to make a better life for us
This biz is all I've got
I wish there was another way
Wishing that this industry was closer to home
'cause every other day I'm second guessing myself
Asking if I've really got it
My worst fear is that you'd ever be out of pocket
All I ever wanted to be was a bread-winner
Every day I stick around here my chance gets slimmer
My faith gets thinner
And time is something that you can't take with you

[Chorus - Ruby Frost & David Dallas]

Wish I could take you though, take you though
It'd be easier to carry this load
Take you though, take you though
It'd be easier to carry this load
That's my plane
Girl it's boarding now they just called out my name
So my feelings won't change
But there's just no more I can do for us if I was to stay
Pray to god you feel the same
There'll be no tears at the gate

Know that I'll be back again
Pray to god you feel the same
There'll be no tears at the gate

[Verse 2 - David Dallas]

If we don't try then we're not alive
But if I've cut the head off then we won't survive
I hope this bond's strong enough to stop a guillotine
'cause I know that you'll be missing all the little things
And so will I
Miss the kiss in the morning
Miss the hug after work
Miss the reassuring talks
The massage when my shoulders hurt
And miss your touch
And there's nothing to replace that
Hope I'm never stupid enough to think i could forsake that
Do something I can't take back
I know you feel the same
I hear that worry in your voice just not feel your pain
Promise soon things will all be real again
And we can visit all those places that we name
One thing's for sure is my feelings won't ever change
This ain't simple
But time is something that you can't take with you

[Chorus - Ruby Frost & David Dallas]

Wish I could take you though, take you though
It'd be easier to carry this load
Take you though, take you though
It'd be easier to carry this load
That's my plane
Girl it's boarding now they just called out my name
So my feelings won't change
But there's just no more I can do for us if I was to stay
Pray to god you feel the same
There'll be no tears at the gate

Know that I'll be back again
Pray to god you feel the same
There'll be no tears at the gate

[Outro - Ruby Frost]

(Ba da da da da ba da da da da da da da)

Pray to god you feel the same
There'll be no tears at the gate

(Ba da da da da ba da da da da da da da)

Know that I'll be back again
Pray to god you feel the same
There'll be no tears at the gate
