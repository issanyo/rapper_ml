[Chorus]
I'm on top this ain't even my peak
And everything they said was out of my reach
It’s getting so close now
Did it all for the hometown
Samoan yeah we ain’t skippin the throw down

[Verse 1]
Had the weight of the world on my shoulders
Felt like a lion in a room full of vultures
Tried to slow me up but the world got focused
Gave me no shine but the world still noticed
Now I'm bout to earn this
Repping my culture
Rocking my hair lava lava like a soldier
Samoan flag hanging off of my wrist
30 steps Steve Nash could he give the assist
If you act wrong
Have your eye and you singing a sad song
Deadman walking go ahead and put a body bag on
I just rock the gear that they never put a tag on
Hanging with the girls you can never get a hand on

[Chorus]
I'm on top this ain't even my peak
And everything they said was out of my reach
It’s getting so close now
Did it all for the hometown
Samoan yeah we ain’t skippin the throw down

[Chorus]
I'm on top this ain't even my peak
And everything they said was out of my reach
It’s getting so close now
Did it all for the hometown
Samoan yeah we ain’t skippin the throw down

[Verse 2]
You know what it is
I'll be puffing out my chest
I'm around the hot chicks screaming humble to the death
Toasting to the good life
I remember way back
Seeing trump wishing I could recreate that
Now we eating meals off of thousand dollar place mats
Five star restaurants you couldn't even wait at
Others make cash we make history
Uso synonymous with victory

[Chorus]
I'm on top this ain't even my peak
And everything they said was out of my reach
It’s getting so close now
Did it all for the hometown
Samoan yeah we ain’t skippin the throw down

[Chorus]
I'm on top this ain't even my peak
And everything they said was out of my reach
It’s getting so close now
Did it all for the hometown
Samoan yeah we ain’t skippin the throw down
