[Hook]

No wonder why they can't get enough
This is more of that look but don't touch
Don't watch TV, watch me, my team is to much
We did it our way from the jump and they can't get enough

This is more of that look but don't touch
Don't watch TV, watch me, my team is to much
We did it our from the jump and they can't get enough

[Verse 1]
Don't get it twisted
When I come through bet the conversation shifts in an instant
High got the juice now
Got the girls actin' pretty loose now
You should put your head in a noose now
If your trying to tango with the boy what's the use now
Ain't no glass heel and my stocks through the roof now
Boy I been beastin' you know I can get real down
Rolling round with Jordan in the Benz with the roof down Bumping all the new sounds fucker
Asking who to watch, man ain't no other
All eyes on me, been here big brother
You CCTV me you see I'm running
You CCTV them you see luggage, dead weight
Only one thing to ask how good is there chase
Cos I'm way out front, ain't sticking back with there pace
Very rare case
So no wonder why they can't get enough

[Hook]

This is more of that look but don't touch
Don't watch TV, watch me, my team is to much
We did it our way from the jump and they can't get enough

This is more of that look but don't touch
Don't watch TV, watch me, my team is to much
We did it our from the jump and they can't get enough

[Bridge]

Can't get enough, can't get enough, fuck
Can't get enough, can't get enough
Can't get enough, tell is like it is
I tell it like it is, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]

Can't get a break though since day "O"
Only thing I ever kick's that Fuego
Used to wait for the Pesos but they came slow
Last tour put the whole crew on the payroll
Say no to the comballs with the same old
Off brand flows that be kicking for the label
Hoping that the radio will play it, are we insane bro
I'm a Michael Corleone, you a Fredo
You afraid bro your a fraud tryna' lay low
All of the above [?]
Can't complain though
I be kicking those can't be contained flows
Lookin' like I'm heaven sent, I should rock a halo
On the same note you should catch a grenade though
I ain't talkin' Bruno Mars, you know that we do it large
It's about who do it best not who did it last
In a different class
No wonder why they can't get enough

[Hook]
This is more of that look but don't touch
Don't watch TV, watch me, my team is to much
We did it our way from the jump and they can't get enough

This is more of that look but don't touch
Don't watch TV, watch me, my team is to much
We did it our from the jump and they can't get enough
