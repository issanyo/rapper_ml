Turning naysayers to believers, been deviating from procedure
Hate to love or leave ya, but I had to, took a breather
Right or wrong, you go weigh it up, I ain't no Libra
Young Virgo into an old geezer
This happens on the sometime, made us soon leisure
Been waiting on some new fans though the speakers
And made me put the controller down on FIFA
But either they tryin' to hard for it today
Or they rhymin' when they really ain't got shit to say
I hate to be that guy, but I have to
This rap thing is more than dad hats and a track suit
It's more than having braids and some tattoos
Posing in your videos like your bad dudes
But tell us keep it G if you knew that you don't
Worst choose of words since Juliana Sloan
But shit, We settle a high case, you can get adjourned
I sat out the court room, fuck it let it burn
What I get I earn, your missus still wishes she can get a turn
Feeling like Snoop with a better perm
That's pimp shit, I let it all hang out on these tracks you're a nip slip
Tell your bird to quick, quick, on top like a lip trick
Got a set of clippers for anyone trying to nit pick
I'll split hairs, you can catch a quick fade
Number 1 stunna, put respeck on this name
It's Dave, Fuck off of this wave
Tell Charlamagne I ain't no baby in this game
Shit's ingrained, write so hard they though I caught a wrist sprain
World crazy and insane, maybe I was lazy or pissed mane
Didn't hit Facebook to explain
Ya didn't know I still got the hardest flow
Question marks over me disappear like I'm Mario
Trust, the fuck's up? By the look of things, I'll say nothing
Unless these albums gon' be skipping like it's double dutch
And don't try to front us for a couple bucks
Since the plays you be selling you out mothers stuff
I'm taking out the rubbish cuz yaya
Start pushing in the circle you get melee'd
Grade A, each and everyday bae
Still getting spins like a Beyblade
Shit is cray cray, that's what they say
I'm from AK, at today's rate you gotta vacate unless you pay grade
Seen may make the [?] stay, just to change pace
Now I'm thinking that it ain't safe
The Yanks aren't the only ones that ain't great
Lord help us when these dudes try and race bait
Don't tell me about no [?]
Cuz nether of these fools ain't ever been a [?] once
Your MCM post call me soft stuff
He ain't no economist and tell him keep his gob shut
And get up off John's nuts
Talking about "free Marcus" with whole family's living [?]
[?] down thing been fucking up some commas
And in the future might turn some man into monsters, but
End of the day I'm just an artist, that grew up half a k from the Otara markets
Papatoetoe where it started, mark the calendar
Only WINZ I had came with a case manager
Brick phone didn't even have a lame camera
No color screen I'm talking snake game caliber
Still the same character
Still laugh at Tua knocking out Shane Cameron, ha
Still wanting things I can not afford
Still [?] undercover in the commodore
Still drop 64 plus 4 like it's not a chore
This sceneâ€™s the best and I'm putting on them all
