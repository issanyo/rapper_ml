I'm in zone, yea

Stay prepared for the up and downs, life is like a see-saw
Some say it's a bitch, man I couldn't agree more
One minute you're on top, then you're in the ER
One minute she wants you, then she wants to leave

All I can do is take the good with the bad and keep on
Gotta work hard, gotta give the fans the mean songs
Give these programmers more shit that they can sleep on
Give these biting cunts more shit that they can feast on

Money come and go out your life like the seasons
People do too sometimes without a reason
And it kind of seemed wrong when they took his life
Should of killed this dude, he's a fucking dick right

And maybe get some insight from Jesus, Allah, Jehova
Some will pray on Sunday some will spend it hungover
Whether drunk or sober, hearts is getting colder, globe is getting warmer
Maybe thats some karma for real

Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor
Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Most people all talk, no action
Over that shit and numerate it to a fraction
They be on the internet having little word wars
Typing in their 2 cents acting like it's worth more

Tell you how to surf, when they've never touched a surfboard
Dissing Tiger Woods when they're fucking even worse whores
You get the urge wanna go and call them out
Making you just as bad as them by all accounts

And what it all amounts to ain't shit
Working at a slave ship hit by the same whip
As the person that you're arguing with
While the people that you arguing about all remain rich

Say laters to this try focus on your own life
Then you see haitians with no home no lights
Make you grateful for what you have
But got to make you wonder if you really are giving what you can

[Hook]
Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor
Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Ricky Gervais]
We all wake up and we go "oh, I ache, I'm not 18 anymore
You know, I'm thirty ni- you know, I'm in my thirties, I'm not-"
But so what, at least I've got my health. And if you haven't got your health-
If you've got one leg, at least I haven't got two legs missing
And if you have lost both legs and both arms, just go "at least I'm not dead!"
I'd rather be dead...

[Hook]
Woke up feeling down, now I'm feeling great
Things can really flip around on you in a day
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

Pay day I'm rich, next day I'm poor
Sittin' on my bed wondering why I bother for
But til tomorrow, til tomorrow
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
