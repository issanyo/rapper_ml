Intro:

Like they always copy mannerisms
But they never start from the very root of this being
And that is, how can I be me?

Verse:

Different from the rest
Feelin' irreplacable
I push em to the left man I do it to the death
They just do it when the weather's good
Explains why they never resonate in any hood
You just stick to vodka and soda but this Henny's good
Tryna describe ideas here that not many would
Everything ain't black and white
Everything ain't crystal clear
You ain't really nice so don't sow a seed that isn't there
Tryna grow a rose from the concrete
Can't photosynthesize if you're photocopied
Dick rider like some jockeys
Wanna do it do it properly
Never do it half-assed
Student of the game
Pull up facts like I'm Narduwar
Dudes sniff around for crumbs lookin' like some aardvarks
I think that [?] are why dynasties can't last
Mind on bigger things
Slick Rick flow tryna get some bigger rings
Ross Taylor with the bat
Tryna take a bigger swing
Still don't know my boundaries
You ain't one of my dogs, shouldn't try to hound me
You ain't part of my crew, shouldn't try to clown me
You ain't bringin' quality, get the fuck from 'round me
There's guidelines around here, standards to uphold
Just got back from Hong Kong, realized I ain't come close
To where I wanna be at, Victoria Harbour
Kowloon skyline's a long way from Hunters Plaza
And just ridin' on a ferry's got me feelin' like Bruce
Sitting cross-legged in a navy Chinese suit
That's some [?] to the dragon shit
They don't wanna try to stay here
They hit us and wanna quit
That's fighting without fighting
Call it bottling lightning, talk of the town
Where I'm from, I've only made it when they never see me 'round
The tyranny of distance
Say it to my face or just mind ya fuckin' business
Backstabbing is for bitches
Got it twisted I'mma straighten you out
I'm through playing games now man
My patience ran out, no doubt
This is the road to redemption
No time for sitting 'round counting Twitter mentions
Or even paying attention
Get this off my chest
Don't give a fuck what they're benching
Still just ordinary people word to John Legend
Self-involved as the next man
But I don't eat if they don't nod they head to my next jam
So the only foot I'm tryna put forward is my best, man
I was groomed to be the main event, not the best man
You get branded with the same stamp
[?] with the same brush as everyone around you
Who never made their own luck
Sat around hating watching other people blow up
Radio? "where the flow for 'em?"
I don't give no fucks
On my own buzz
There comes a time of life that you gotta own up 'cause
You prolly smokin' up drugs
Prolly did 'nough fuckin' around
When dudes showin' out
I came to shut it down
Shut it down man
Shut it down
Like Pete Rock did with P.E
Shut it down
On the same label as dudes that buckle down
From South Aucks over to [?]-town boy
Shut it down man
Shut it down
It ain't often someone like me gon' come around
