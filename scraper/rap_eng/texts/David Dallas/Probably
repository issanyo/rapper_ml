[Hook]
I went without when I had no money
(Probably, 'cause of that)
Then I'm doing okay but I still feel hungry
(Probably, 'cause of that)
I do my thing so people love me
People hate me, seems so funny
They fuck with me or say fuck me
Why should I be so lucky?

(Probably, 'cause of that)
Never cared enough to kiss ass
(Probably, 'cause of that)
All I do is go to skip past
(Probably, 'cause of that)
Used to sneak in with the hip flask
(Probably, 'cause of that)
Ive been the man at making it last
(Probably...)

[Verse 1]
Probably
Cause I'm not talking it up
'cause I'm South Auckland as fuck
Never been the one to start causing a fuss
Ain't this shit already awkward enough?
So I don't try and worry 'bout being South Auckland enough
Tryna be a G, tryna talk tough
We already hear that more than enough
The media just seem to be little caught up
Saying that we're petty thieves, that we're poor cunts
Relying on the government to support us -
Fact is most of us got a lot more sussed
We know they're gonna hear you way before us
Probably 'cause of that that I gotta talk up
Spend about four months on the same verse, all up
Just to make sure that there's more us
Trust, when they pour up, this'll be the shit they all bump
Got a lot on my plate right now
Appetite like I never ate right now
Whole lot of music that I hate right now
Gettin' put to rest, I'ma say "lights out"
I'ma play lights out, Superbowl twenty-thirteen
Lights out like Billy in the first scene
Set it off like [?]
'cause I recall when they weren't keen

[Verse 2]
Probably
'cause I don't know no better
Still tryna write the most dope flow ever
Too brown for a trap EDM thing
Too white for the poly reggae that your friends sing
Miss me with the jumping on trends thing
Man, even at the school I was attending
I was into hardcore rap shit back then
They was on a Boyz II Men thing
If we're speakin' 'bout a boys to men thing
It's the end of the road for this "being all zen" thing -
Wack cunt season is ending
"They can eat a dick", that's the message I'm sending
I seen this underground thing turn overground
And gang signs getting thrown around
With trust fund kids in the CBD
Thinkin' that they [?] now, like it's kosher now
'cause I know that I could be in a cubicle, with a tie on
Not a hoody, I was already grown up
By the time I spit my first verse and I hear the show-ups[?]
So no wonder why you getting on my nerves for
'cause I was the unheard dude, 'bout to join the workforce
You takin' up a spot you didn't work for, figure I deserve yours
