[Verse 1: Turquoise Prince]
Head shaved for battle (head shaved for battle)
Pink Romper Stomper (pink Romper Stomper)
Stand up for something (stand up for something)
Say something real (uh)
I kill these rappers when I aim for the heel
See me coming? Better run for the hills
We're not flexing on Lamborghini's
Never see us acting anything but real
Just be yourself (just be yourself)
Mother Nature in my system
When I need to free myself (gotta free myself)
It's just me, myself and I
We've been waiting my whole life
I can feel a python wrap around my neck
Like I'm running out of time
Everybody needs time to unwind, yeah
Neck brace for the neck breaks
They double take when I grace the place
I mean, I look nice in my Vinnies shit
If you bite my style who am I to hate? Word
I just drop a couple bars and the ground shakes
Show a little talent and they all race
Oh, and by the way

[Chorus: Solo, Turquoise Prince & David Dallas]
Just wanted to say I'm sorry, sorry to keep you waiting
Waiting for something different, a wave to get swept away in
Who want it? Who want it? Do you want it? You want it?
Come get it, come get it, 'cause we got it, we got it
Come get it, swept away, come get it, swept away
Come get it, ain't no measuring the length of the wave
So come get it, swept away, come get it, swept away
Come get it, this kind of shit, it doesn't happen every day

[Verse 2: David Dallas]
I said, "What the fuck is up?" By the look it's nothing much
If your hood is such and such then you better chuck it up
When we come through buckle up, run it straight, that's up the guts
Taumalolo with the ball ain't tough enough to ruffle us
[?] uppercut, get your muscle up, plus your hustle up
Ain't tryna quote myself, but fuck it cuz, this what struggle does
Ain't no humble bus on that gasoline
How I had to be, Martin Luther thing, I had a dream
Can't be mad at me, I'm onstage instead of at the factory
The faculty: Turquoise, Horrorshow [?] and me
They been hassling, everybody waiting on a flow
Have some work from Ralph Lauren I been keeping on the low
But no mo'

[Chorus: Solo, Turquoise Prince & David Dallas]
Just wanted to say I'm sorry, sorry to keep you waiting
Waiting for something different, a wave to get swept away in
Who want it? Who want it? Do you want it? You want it?
Come get it, come get it, 'cause we got it, we got it
Come get it, swept away, come get it, swept away
Come get it, ain't no measuring the length of the wave
So come get it, swept away, come get it, swept away
Come get it, this kind of shit, it doesn't happen every day
Nuh-uh

[Verse 3: Solo]
Sorry to keep you waiting, got this
Weight on my shoulders, feel like I'm Atlas
Tell me, what's the hold up? Only getting older
I maintain my balance, won't catch me tripping like Alice
In a down under land with Dav Dallas so understand
If you want it then come 'cause we got it in the pocket
Do it bigger than if my man, Cole, was taking pics of Christopher Wallace
This type of shit don't happen every day (Nah)
This ain't Slick Rick, it's Smooth Nic and he taking centre stage
So if you got a prior engagement then you better change them plans
Me today, a sweet escape when a thousand people raise them hands
Turn around to Adit and I said, "I think we made it, man"
He said, "Let's ride this wave while we can"

[Pre-Chorus: Solo]
Now the time flies by by the minute
But the bright blue sky is the limit
And I just can't wait for whatever come my way
Ain't a measure in the length of the wave

[Chorus: Solo, Turquoise Prince & David Dallas]
Just wanted to say I'm sorry, sorry to keep you waiting
Waiting for something different, a wave to get swept away in
Who want it? Who want it? Do you want it? You want it?
Come get it, come get it, 'cause we got it, we got it
Come get it, swept away, come get it, swept away
Come get it, ain't no measuring the length of the wave
So come get it, swept away, come get it, swept away
Come get it, this kind of shit, it doesn't happen every day
Nuh-uh
