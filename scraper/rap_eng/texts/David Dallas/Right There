You know that I like what you do so slow down (So slow down)
And catch this groove
Won't you help us singin
Won't you help me say ooo

(Chorus)
Keep it right there, keep it right there if you wanna please me
Keep it right there, keep it right there and I'll make it easy
Keep it right there, keep it right there if you wanna please me
Keep it right there, keep it right there and I'll make it easy

So just keep it right there, keep it right there
If we don't keep it down, down somebody might hear
Let me make this quite clear, that I don't care if you don't
So if you're feel the need to scream my name girl you go
Don't try to give me kudos, know I'm numero uno
Can never question my game, we ain't playing Clue though
It's more like doing Judo, gotta know what to do though
It's a contact sport not knowing this could be brutal
Feeling like I'm from Pluto, another world
Know you ain't feeling these other dudes they make you wanna hurl
Listen girl, roll with the winners there's no more bad luck, maybe later
You could be stripped like a stack shot, player haters
Tryna cut my grass they ain't never gonna last
Slow to get a joke, I'll always be the last one to laugh
Ha fucking ha, feeling like a younger Nas
But the accolades ain't the only thing that's coming fast

Keep it right there, keep it right there if you wanna please me
Said this could be a breeze
Keep it right there, keep it right there and I'll make it easy
Start listening to me
Keep it right there, keep it right there if you wanna please me
For real, for real, for real
Keep it right there, keep it right there and I'll make it easy
Take notes, let me show you the ropes

You've been talking up your game, I try not to do the same
Under promise over deliver, it's always been my thang
That's words to live by, I'm expecting some ribeye
I don't mess with the cheap cuts, hit me if you can keep up
See what happens from here ain't really set in stone
Plenty dudes steppin to the plate swinging tryna get you home
Or just tryna get your phone, I'm not tryna doing either though
I'll be studying the night, pull that all nighter so
Roll around if you want a tutorial
All I do is practical, I'm not into boring you
Theories for the lecturers, I'm just tryna tutor you
Your brain responds better to some 1 on 1 schoolin and ooh
Get the feeling that you're learning quick
Get the feeling that you're really trying to please
Like someone who works for tips
Get the feeling you could murder this
So keep it right there girl its
Not yet

Keep it right there, keep it right there if you wanna please me
Said this could be a breeze
Keep it right there, keep it right there and I'll make it easy
Start listening to me
Keep it right there, keep it right there if you wanna please me
For real, for real, for real
Keep it right there, keep it right there and I'll make it easy
Take notes, let me show you the ropes
