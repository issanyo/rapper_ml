[Intro]
Tint squad
Another fire & ice hit dog
Now I'm flying, about the lift-off

[Verse 1]
Sitting up at Harlem, eye of the hurricane
I hear back in NZ they callin' me the fuckin man
First one out of my country doing it in this manner
Make a lot of dudes green and mad, call them Bruce Banner
Couple screws loose, I could probably use two spanners
Girls come at me with stereo from the left and right
Two channels, you think you could live this life
But really could you handle leaving everything you know behind
If you knew that you might not make it over there
Might get ridiculed
Might struggle to make the ends meet and get a little food
Might have to go home with your tail between your legs
And hear that you were dreaming
Thinking you could make it over there, yea
If you with that, then we cut from the same cloth
Against all odds like Apple til it pays off
A lot of dudes say they would but they straight soft
Call me Phil Ivey, pulling cards if we face off
I'm about to take off and so is this girl here
I'm talkin' my career, she's talkin' her ???
Guess that deserves a beer, tell her to sip it baby
Don't really have time to kick it lately, I'm gone

[Hook]
I'm never going back, caution's in the wind
Give a fuck about the odds bro, I play to win, yea
But these people got no idea what I do
That's why they couldn't walk a mile wearing my shoes

Couldn't lace 'em up, couldn't make 'em look good
Don't nobody wanna bad movie when the book's good
But these people got no idea what I do
That's why they couldn't walk a mile wearing my shoes

[Verse 2]
A little bit of knowledge is a bad thing
Best you know the girl if you're gonna buy the damn ring
This the type of life to have to flippin' like a handspring
Or stretch your patience like a motherfucking hand string
I just do the damn thing, I don't really talk about it
Plowin' dudes off that pull these other people, walking around
Now I'm really pointing out that shit
You thinking an opportunity falls out the sky and you catch it?
You dead wrong, gotta be headstrong
Questions I get asked now are way too important for me to get wrong
I got my future at stake, the future estate
It's all about timing and this biz caught me two minutes late
Livin' out of suitcase for too many days
And miss the comforts of home in too many ways
But I make my own luck, because I've seen too many pray
And when it comes time for the bills, I have too many unpaid
Still just a simple man, buys like a histagram
Handsome motherfucker, take picture Instagram
Habitual line stepper, push it to the limit man
Damn, gotta line up to kick again, it's over

[Hook]
I'm never going back, caution's in the wind
Give a fuck about the odds bro, I play to win, yea
But these people got no idea what I do
That's why they couldn't walk a mile wearing my shoes

Couldn't lace 'em up, couldn't make 'em look good
Don't nobody wanna bad movie when the book's good
But these people got no idea what I do
That's why they couldn't walk a mile wearing my shoes

[Outro]
Couldn't walk a mile, couldn't walk a mile in these (3x)

If you ain't what you claim to be, better watch what you say to me
