[Verse 1]
No surprise here this is just the way things go
Wanna be Spieth on the 18th hole
Want the lifestyle of the affluent
But when your parents still rent
It ain't happening
Decided as a kid you ain't having it
Gotta get some Polo
Gotta get some Palace shit
Cop the new Nikes or risk embarrassment
Same with the jeans
That's the law of the averages
Same with the whip
That's the law of averages
Want a new chick
This could be the catalyst
German logo
The pursuit of happiness
Fuck slow-mo
I'm about a rapid fix
Think of pro athletes with no management
Gettin money, we just never taught to handle it
Spot up shooters, we never taught to handle it
Just sign here twenty-five percent per annum shit
Probably be the same 'till we inanimate
Hear they serve gear and the cannabis
In the hood country club

[Hook]
Here in the hood country club
In the hood country club
Never been no scrub
Rock the cheap shit and get no love
Don't nobody ever grow up
Here in the hood country club
In the hood country club
Never been no scrub (No scrubs)
Rock the cheap and get no love (Don't love)
Don't nobody ever grow up (Don't go grow up)
Don't we all want the same thing? (Same thing)
Hope the money gonna change things (Change things)
But it never does
When you in the club

[Verse 2]
They say I worry about the wrong things
Never catch me sipping a Rekorderlig
Never opted into Kiwisaver either
Still won't be caught dead in no Ford Festiva
Fuck plans for retirement
Got cash for the Yeezys
We buying it
Things we learn on rap vids
We applying it
Naysayers want ammo
We supplying it
Squares could never grasp the environment
'Till they realise they inside of it
So can't be turning up your noses
When even you tryna keep up with the Joneses
Turns out we just got different Joneses
And even real country clubs full of posers
For most of us it's our first rodeo
Parents never left no portfolio (...shit)
Hood pass intact know the riff-raff
You call when police fail to get your shit back
Who never leave leave the house if the gear's mismatched
Pour the Henny up and kick back...

[Hook]
Here in the hood country club
In the hood country club
Never been no scrub
Rock the cheap shit and get no love
Don't nobody ever grow up
Here in the hood country club
In the hood country club
Never been no scrub (No scrubs)
Rock the cheap shit and get no love (Don't love)
Don't nobody ever grow up (Don't go grow up)
Don't we all want the same thing? (Same thing)
Hope the money gonna change things (Change things)
But it never does
When you in the club

[Outro]
Country club
Country club
No scrubs
Don't love
Don't go grow up
Country club (The country club)
Country club (The country club)
No scrubs
Don't love
Don't go grow up
Don't we all want the same thing?
Hope the money gonna change things
But it never does
When you in the club
