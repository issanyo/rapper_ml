Verse]
Gimme that mic fool, lemme get a few things off the chest
I remember them, student days put me to the test yes
Actually you could say, that I put myself through it
How could I be helpful to mum if I ain't sail through a
Tertiarty institute, older brother, sister who
Did it, so you ain't shit if you ain’t in the livin room
With “bachelor” on the wall, this plaque is awarded for
What ? I don’t know shit.. back chillin on the wall
Outside of the guidance counsellors office
And he sittin askin if I know, what I’m really wantin out of life
See I don't Know what I want to do or pursue
I just want to make moves with the crew to hit

[Hook]
Big Time
Soon we’ll hit the Big Time
When we hit the Big Time
Soon we’ll hit the Big Time

So you gotta reach for that money
Keep receipts for that money
They gonn’ leach all that money
When you least need it, but we

Hit the Big Time
Soon we’ll hit the Big Time

[Verse]
Year 00, now I’m outside in the big bad world
Tryna make some dollars maybe I could bag a bad girl
What, what you wanna do ? still don’t really know
So just grabbed the university brochure and I chose
Somethin at a whim, I.T? Yeah, I like computer games
“but I heard their pay got lower since Y2K?”.. fuck it
I suck at economics and accounting, so BCom is out
B Bursary cut down all the choices, ain't no medicine or engineering for me
Now the only small problem is the fees
Cost 3 and a half to 5 over 4 years
Yeah its steep but you shoulda tried to save before you’re here
You gonna need money for text books on top of that here
Here’s a discount card for Shads cheapen up your beer
Don’t fear, if you ain’t got no money little Dave
Here’s a student loan form, you can sign your life away to

[Hook]
Big Time
Soon we’ll hit the Big Time

Hit the Big Time
Soon we’ll hit the Big Time
