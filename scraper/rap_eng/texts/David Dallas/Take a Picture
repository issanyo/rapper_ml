Yeah

I said it's D dot D A double L A S
She just thinking LMFAO, tell that she ain't well impressed
Cause we ain't on telly yet, ain't getting those spins like
Rihanna or Umbrella yet, so she acting celibate
But I’m in my element, I don’t take that shit to heart
I like proving them wrong just to make myself look smart
They see the future as a blur to me, is looking sharp
My money's on me, you should get in from the start
So we order 4 shots of raw Jäger, while the bottle pours
Think of how it's gonna feel, when you know you got it all
Cause we on the bottom floor, looking at the top and all
People say we crazy, but they just bet on all the balls
They just wish for things to fall into their lap
I’m on a mission for it I won’t sleep and pause until it happens
Baby quit your chit and chatter, yap and kick back and handle the shot
In a couple years you won't believe you meet us in this spot

So you should take a picture, caaaaa chick
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit
And say this... You were down when they weren’t
When no one gave a damn what we did
Here we are, pouring out shots at the bar
Swearing one day we’ll be stars...
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit

So take a flick, remember it in a couple years
When you see dudes, resembling us
Then run and tell your friends that you met us, it was nuts
We poured some drinks and party till the sun came up
See it ain't even a thing, that we ain't being a bang
And I ain’t really no singer, ain't really no king
I’m just a simple man, just tryin' to do really big things
From the land flightless birds, 'bout to grow really big wings
And girl I really do think that truth comes out the more that we drink
Wouldn’t tell you this stuff otherwise I’d probably feel stink
But you caught me on an off day, or is it an on day
Shit, I dont even know its been a long day
Barman pass the bombay, plus one for my lady friend
Make a mental note of this, things won't be the same again
When you see our names again, they gonna be up in lights
Then this here'll be history, for now is just another night

So take a picture, caaaaa chick
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit
And say this... You were down when they weren’t
When no one gave a damn what we did
Here we are, pouring out shots at the bar
Swearing one day we’ll be stars...
Take a flick, before the world's up on this shit
