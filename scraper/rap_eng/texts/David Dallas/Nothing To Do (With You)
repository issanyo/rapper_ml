Don’t give me up
You ain’t gonna take me down
I don’t like to remember when you were around
But you walk my way like you got something to say
This ain't got shit to do with you

Been a while since you had it like this I bet
Said I’d never do better but this chick I met
Is a bit of all right yea she’s pretty alright
And she ain't in the club trying to kick it all night
Doesn’t get too drunk, talk shit, cause fights
Funnily enough, other chicks seem to all like her
Unlike you when we were together girl
You were on some 2Pac shit you against the world
I was on some Marvin gay shit what’s going on
Sometimes Rodney king can't we all just get along
You were never ever wrong I was never ever right
We would just forever fight, girl I had to get a life
And I’m happy now, yet you coming back around like its happy hour
Tryin take more shots tryin tap me out
I gotta let you know it ain't gonna happen now

Don’t give me up
You ain’t gonna take me down
I don’t like to remember when you were around
But you walk my way like you got something to say
This ain't got shit to do with you

I don’t know what the issue is
Why you seem to really care who I kick it with
When we broke up you didn’t give a shit
Don’t cry dry your eyes here’s a tissue Miss
Heard you backstabbed my girl and I’m sick of it
I don’t wanna hear you pleading your innocence
I don’t even wanna see you a little bit
And that’s all it is you hate that you isn’t missed
Its your ego, got your world going balls up like a free-throw
Probably got you playing fuck you by cee low
Think about me like its really my fault
I’m thinking about you like your really bipolar
Really quite over your juvenile ways
Better back that ass up like juvenile says
Before you thinking coming round here
Go and get your own shit together
Do I make myself clear

Don’t give me up
You ain’t gonna take me down
I don’t like to remember when you were around
But you walk my way like you got something to say
This ain't got shit to do with you
