I don't want the world, I want you!
One man band, walk to my own drum
Call me self-centered but it takes one and no one
Guess I had a one track mind from the start
Trying to make these songs get better at my craft
Get upon the charts maybe get a couple plaques
And in the process might break a couple hearts
Part of the game tho I said you told me
But things changed and I'm not the old me
Learned a few tricks of the trade
Learnt that I don't wanna be alone at the end of the day
Had to hit you on the phone everytime i was awake
Can't do it on my own, really need for you to stay
Tho you hear me say it alot
I'm busy doing this step further, and make it to the top
Since thay never expire, but for you i'd drop it all in a sec cause there is none higher

[Hook]
Pull the rug from underneath me, take away all that I made
Feel like all I need is you, for me to see another day
Pull the rug underneath me, take away all I possess
Feel like all I need is you, all I need is you
Cause I know you've seen, that the boy got big dreams
You might think that the only thing i serve is me
But I hang up my boots, make a promise to you
Cause the truth is I don't want the world, I want you!

Yeah! it don't come around often something like this
See, I think about the old me, there's nothing I miss
Sure, I had a good time along the way
Ain't living for the past tho, I'm living for today
Tryna make the best of all i can for me and you
And tomorrow's all good if I'm seeing you
Nah I'm never living you behind
A little bit of fame couldn't keep you from my mind!
Different time zones! still you keep me on the line
Checking out my watch sleep in my eyes
So don't be surprised if I show up by your side
Trying to talk about some plans
Get on one knee hope you offer up your hand
Trying to make you understand, I put nothing above you
Nowadays you're the person I look up to
World full of noise, I'm just tryna cut through
Thay can take it all, but I'm not giving up you!

You might think that the only thing i serve is me
But I hang up my boots, make a promise to you
Cause the truth is I don't want the world, I want you!
I just want you baby!
I don't want the world, I want you!
