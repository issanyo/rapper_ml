[Verse 1: David Dallas]
Yeah, yeah
I'm high upon a new wave of confidence
I'm trying to ride it to a few different continents
Known in the country that I'm from but anonymous
To most of the populous in dominant marketplaces
I'm from New Zealand and their not used to seeing different faces
And they don't ever turn the radio to different stations
I gotta do it though cause Mum's getting sick of waiting
When I was young she used to tell me "Have some fucking patience"
But she loved the baby boy, raise the bar like I'm on roids
On my game like I'm on joysticks, still playing with these toys
I'm grateful for the voice I've been given
Big boy now no purple ribbon 'bout to have all of the shutterbugs flicking
Straight sippin' vodka soda with the twist in
Jamiroquai playing I don't say it to be different
It's still hip hop in the vein, Smirnoff in the brain
Always been a cool dude I'll let you know if it change

[Hook]
I'm kicking back, feeling good on a Friday
Ain't letting all the bullshit get in my way
Know that I stay

Caught in a daze
Caught in a daze
Caught in a daze
Caught in a daze

I'm in a good mood, don't mess with my high
Things are looking up, you can see in my eyes
So you know I'm

Caught in a daze
Caught in a daze
Caught in a daze
Caught in a daze

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Bitch I’m caught up in a daze, caught up with these polices again
Bitch, got these swishers and these vehicles we chiefin' up in
That’s why they hate
Custom colours, has my niece end up on 6's
If you ever tryna' find me, I prolly' be water whippin'
Cookin' up and cuttin'
Open up baggy, stuff em' like muffins
Out of dope, but yo prices ain't in my budget, so fuck it
I stuck em' up, and got on the highway
Freddie Gibbs get fried, like everyday is Friday
In the place I reside, I keep that iron cause them goons gonna' be lurking
Keep my dough spot popping and my boost phone twerkin'
Put me on the lick and anybody move, I'ma' murk em'
Knock em' out their shoes and give their ass the blues, that's for certain
Bitch, you purpin' n' you flirtin' with death, if you fuck with mine
For your shit to walk up and take your life, in this life of crime
In this life of mine I took risks and put my life on the line
Agents ask me for a statement, I decline

[Hook]

[Verse 3: David Dallas]
Yeah
I'm standing tall, they can never chop me down
Deeply rooted in the ground
Way I spit it so profound
Know the sound like some shit you heard before, but it ain't Everyone's an artist now but I'm using different paint man
I'm using different ink for the story, this is guts, this is glory
It's the rush of performing, it's the slut when you're horny
It's the feeling that you get when you wake up in the morning
Or that feeling that you get when the sun's dawning
On another day
And you ain't seen your life another way
Been working that same job for next to nothing pay
Plugging away at your dreams, trying to hold this shit together
While the world's tugging away at the seams, see
Struggling it ain't no thing, once you looking back
But fucked if you'd ever again try to go through that
So I just see it like a vintage car
You put your all in to ride it out once, then it's in the garage
You talk about it with your friends as a symbol of the hard work
This is all a means to an end
Looking at it through a lens that's rose tinted
It's probably why you hear it in my voice, I'm so committed
