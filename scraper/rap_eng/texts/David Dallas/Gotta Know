I am, I am, I am, I am

Swinging for the stands, let me see your hands
Try to mash out on this life, fame and do the dance
What's the plan, man, I'mma hit the city and sigh-see
Lot of imitators, you can tell them to bite these
Hide these on the sideline, like Spike Lee
I'm playing outta town, someone tell them to invite me
My flight leaves early tomorrow, let's get acquainted
The town's looking kinda dull, it's time to paint it
Walking around this whole spot like we made it
If they ain't talking about us, we will name it
Don't give a fuck who they put up on the A list
See, anything we don't like, we replace it
Change it, rearrange it, what's your favorite drink?
Once you take the shot this what we be chasing
With, don't make a dif', yeah, you in the basic
Chick, tryna get the grip, this is what it is

Don't be blinded by the lights
Killing day, we up all night
Pour it up, girl, it's alright
I just gotta know
You wanna be my main squeeze, baby?
I gotta know
Will you give me what I need, baby?
I just gotta know
You wanna be my main squeeze, baby?
I gotta know
Will you give me what I need, baby?
I just gotta know

Yeah, get it right, roll with the winners
And if anybody asks, you don't know when you'll be finished
Ain't nobody business and you can say ah, just ain't no limits
This is my piece here, I be a hard act to follow
Probably heard when I see the bank balance tomorrow
For now it don't matter, it's no jetter 'ain't got no talent and no manners
I'm no fan of and don't dabble in scrub shit
So if you need a cab you won't have to cover it
Just pour it up, pour it up like Rihanna
Good girl gone bad, Charlotte to Samantha
Sex and the City fan, I know you can hand with
This, any photo looks good if the angle fits
But you final, you don't need no camera tricks
Tryna get the grips, just what it is

Don't be blinded by the lights
Killing day, we up all night
Pour it up, girl, it's alright
I just gotta know
You wanna be my main squeeze, baby?
I gotta know
Will you give me what I need, baby?
I just gotta know
You wanna be my main squeeze, baby?
I gotta know
Will you give me what I need, baby?
I just gotta know
