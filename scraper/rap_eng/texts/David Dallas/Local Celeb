[Verse 1]

Stepped up in your town, came to shut it down
Not tryna' step on no-one's toes, just do my thing and bounce
If you ask me whereabouts we are I couldn't pick it on a map
So don't think I'm tryna move in with you cats, just relax
Don’t feel threatened, gotta home of my own bro
That’s really cool, that your your home town’s version of Bone
Got a version of Wayne, too
Ask if I just flew in, then tryna' stunt on me cause he’s been on a plane, too
It’s not a big deal, not tryna' show out, you know that guy that buy the top shelf when he go out
Like he got money to blow out, knows the bouncers, gets you thrown out
King of the clubs but he's never left his home town
And you can keep your women, bro, don't be mess talking us, we're just livin' bro
It's obvious, you really famous in your city, bro
I'm sorry I ain't in a rush to take a picture though

[Hook]

I know what's going down, everywhere's the same
Round here it's like cheers, everybody knows your name
You're a local celeb, right, local celeb, right
Local celeb, live the local celeb life
I know what's going down, everywhere's the same
Round here it's like cheers, everybody knows your name
You're a local celeb, right, local celeb, right
Local celeb, live the local celeb life

[Verse 2]

Girl, I know your type, posing on your Instagram
Chattin' to every other guy, I hear like it's a mess
Swear that you don't give a damn
What these other girls think
Act hella snobby barely qualified to serve drinks
Never worked a real job but you model sometimes
Heard you're an actress, too, you hosting club nights
You're tryna' sing as well, you really love the lights
Long as they're on you, who gives a fuck, right?
Don't hate the player, hate the game
You might just date a footy player for the fame
You wanna be a WAG, just to be a name
But look too thirsty and it just makes you a lame

[Hook]

I know what's going down, everywhere's the same
Round here it's like cheers, everybody knows your name
You're a local celeb, right, local celeb, right
Local celeb, live the local celeb life
I know what's going down, everywhere's the same
Round here it's like cheers, everybody knows your name
You're a local celeb, right, local celeb, right
Local celeb, live the local celeb life

[Outro]

I seen stars before and you ain't one
Picked up a brush, it doesn't mean you can paint, son
A spot was open so you thought you could take one
I deal with true stories and I ignore the fake ones
I seen stars before and you ain't one
Picked up a brush, it doesn't mean you can paint, son
A spot was open so you thought you could take one
I deal with true stories and I ignore the fake ones
