Yeah, just be quiet in the cheap seats
Sh sh
Zip it up, I don't wanna hear a thing if it isn't us
Beep beep
Make way coz we're coming through
I guarantee that I know what to do
Be quiet in the cheap seats
Sh sh
Zip it up, I don't wanna hear a thing if it isn't us
Beep beep
Make way coz we're coming through
I guarantee that I know what to do

[Verse 1]
Everybody can tell you how to do it
They never did it
To paraphrase Jay
I'm just sitting minding my business
So fuck what they say
Unless it's pay day
And you signing off on the cheques
Shouldn't be hearing more
Than silence come out your neck
And nah, I'm not trying to flex
It's time that you come correct
You start a sentence with 'haven't'
End a sentence with 'yet'
Then what the fuck you expect
Respect gotta be earned now
The floor's mine, no more speaking outta turn now
I got the urge now to go berserk now
Go put the word out
Motherfuck your feelings if you're feeling hurt now
Take what I deserve now
Flippin 'em the bird now
Probably build a castle
Where your house of cards burnt down
You 'bout to hear me doin' this, that and the third now
So keep dreaming 'bout what you'd do if I weren't round
I'm coming on like Johnny Bones in the third round
Talk's big, keep still
I'm 'bout to push the word down

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Save that for you and yours
Coz we don't wanna hear it no more, no more
Save that for you and yours
Coz we don't wanna hear it no more, no more

[Verse 2]
Just the facts
I don't wanna hear your tape
Got a date with the real world
Can't be a minute late
Slow your roll
Pump your breaks
If you've never been behind a wheel
It's time to put you in your place
Shit, no one likes a backseat driver in a whip
No one likes to hear some eats dude talking shit
If you ain't hard piece then why the fuck you chiming in?
If you ain't Shane Warne why the fuck you trying to spin?
I'm trying to win and get elevated
We ain't in the same division, they been relegated
Don't speak on my business if you ain't delegated
Talk's cheap and we don't celebrate it
Need better excuses to get hella faded
Everybody got an opinion on what's served up
What film's good, which girl's hot, work sucks
Shit, the earth's crust
Unless you experts in the field then it ain't worth much
