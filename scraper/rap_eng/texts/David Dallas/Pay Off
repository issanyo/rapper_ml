Yeah, my plans getting bigger, my hands on the slicker
I'm really tryna kill it, time to stand and deliver
Not taking no days off, until this thing takes off
See I got this feeling, so I just hope that it pays off
I hope that it pays off tryina put up
I hope that it pays off,tryina put up
Not taking no days off, until this thing takes off
See I got this feeling, so I just hope that it pays off

Looking at my home, looking at my face
They said I wouldn't make it out
Now my phone's on roam, in a foreign place
And I'm not gonna waste my chance to compete
I ain't even on my peak yet
Word ?I ain't even know the beats
From a small place, that they wonder why I seem vex
That these fake eyes dudes wanna be friends
Never ran, let me see them on the weekend
Growing up now, not playing pretend
They tryina hammer start growing, I'm tryina beat them
From the Am to the Pm
Walk pass you can hear the bass beating
Megatron reps, everybody retreating

My plans getting bigger, my hands on the slicker
I'm really tryina kill it, so I stand and deliver
Not taking no days off, until this thing takes off
See I got this feeling, so I just hope that it pays off
I hope that it pays off, tryina put up
I hope that it pays off, tryina put up
Not taking no days off, until this thing takes off
See I got this feeling, so I just hope that it pays off

No favours or hand outs bro
I got a planned out, can't turn back if the shit don't pan out
See you ain't gotta wonder why I dont hang out
I'm in the lab making shit you can bang out, to
As this empty bottle, old pizza, YouTube shit, Tint Squad in the building
Always laughing at some stupid shit
But we on some ruthless shit, slow it down like Houston shit
And you're a vice like politics, cause I ain't got no use for rit
I stay running round doing my thing
Daylight Robbery, the crew that I bring, something like Mike on pursuit on my dream
Eyes on the prize every time that I swing, swing, swing, swing

My plans getting bigger, my hands on the slicker
I'm really tryina kill it, so I stand and deliver
Not taking no days off, until this thing takes off
See I got this feeling, so I just hope that it pays off
I hope that it pays off, tryina put up
I hope that it pays off, tryina put up
Not taking no days off, until this thing takes off
See I got this feeling, so I just hope that it pays off
