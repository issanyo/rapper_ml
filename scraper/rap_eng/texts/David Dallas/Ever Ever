[Verse]

Been with me through the worst and the best
Swear on this beat in my chest
I'mma be there in a sec if you call
Give you my all
I stand tall, cause you make me believe
Even when it's dark, I can light it up
Nothin we can't achieve
And I've been breathing these sighs of relief
When I was feelin my chance was blown
My team lets me know I'm not alone
I feel stronger than Kanye, because of you
And I'd take a million more L's to get the W
And when I get it, betta believe that I'mma smother you
Covet you, what's mine is yours â€“ know how your brother do
Just to show you I owe you and nah this ain't no other dude
Never change, never strange, round you I'm so comfortable for real

[Chorus x2]

So when you see me put ya hands together
If you really down with me I'll be your man forever
When you feel a little weak I'm right here remember
Let these people talk, they can be mad forever, ever

[Verse]

I never, knew I could feel this way
We don't reveal or say, but even the coolest exteriors can get peeled away
Under certain situations, feelin ya limitations
Man it seem like god couldn't overcome the shit I'm facin
I'm cavin, never sayin that it's your help I need
But you came and, saved a brother who thinkin selfishly
I failed to see, all sad feelings temporary
And like fine wine.. the shit gets better with time
So shine baby shine, do this for you as much as me
Rewind baby wind, what we've been through will make us kings
And this game got valleys and peaks
Walls, barriers, seas
I ain't scared to fall cause I know that you carryin me

[Chorus x2]
So when you see me put ya hands together
If you really down with me I'll be your man forever
When you feel a little weak I'm right here remember
Let these people talk, they can be mad forever, ever
