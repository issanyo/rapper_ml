I just want everything to be perfect
Everything to fit into place
House, food on the table and some liquor to chase
But my moms still hooked on how cigarettes taste
And my dad lost his eye and a bit of his face
About a month back cause of cancer
Trying to figure how to really deal, no evander
This sort of shit can make you jump off the ---
When peeps that don’t know you seem to think that you’re a wanker
But I don’t harbor no anger to em, my big brothers oversees wonder how he’s doing
Wish that he could be home with us, he a loner at heart so worry if he’s on his own too much
And I owe so much to the fam, that im feeling like a failure
When I can't even lend a hand on the money front
I’m hoping things is on the up and up
When my career fingers crossed I don’t fuck it up
But all it takes is one man and one word
And the greatest song make it go unheard
Lord knows there was better men before that went under the radar
I kid you no stories, so I isn’t mad at stations who don’t play my recordings
I’m just fucking happy that ‘m performing
And that you listening to me, right now, you’ll see

So you should put your hands up, hey
It ain’t perfect but we be doing okay
I’m living proof you could do what you never thought
And best believe it’s the truth that you hear me talk

Bro you should put your hands up, hey
It isn’t perfect but we be doing okay
I’m living proof you could do what you never thought
And best believe it’s the truth that you hear me talk

Where we headed now there isn’t no guessing
But I’m tired of hearing the same old questions
When ya gonna find a real profession
I don’t need a reminder bro’s stop stressing
I rather keep messing with this music shit and hardly make a cent
Before I go to David Brent just to pay the rent
Because an office cubicle is not suitable when you’re the star
Like they trying to make you play the bench
I ain’t content with that, I won't stop to surrender like -----
Ya see the flip side is I need a new Mac pro
A lack though----
Could probably ask my girlfriend if she would lend for that
But too proud for a hand or a hand out
I’m tired of staying this still, I’m trying to stand out
Be the man now, that’s the plan now
From here on guess we’ll see out it fans out

So you should put your hands up, hey
It ain’t perfect but we be doing okay
I’m living proof you could do what you never thought
And best believe it’s the truth that you hear me talk

Bro you should put your hands up, hey
It ain’t perfect but we be doing okay
I’m living proof you could do what you never thought
And best believe it’s the truth that you hear me talk

I know I walk like I grew up in a war zone
I tread lightly, even when a store won't
Blow my horn though
I don’t like to draw no attention to myself
How ironic my careers based on getting on the shelf
Or a blog or a stage, put my whole life on the page
And I hope that some relate to what I say
It Sounds so vain when I put it in those terms
When asked about the industry I ain’t go no words
But people press try to ask me how them hoes were
Wonder why I wasn’t at the club when my bros were
On the red carpet showing up with a chauffer
And VIP with big bottles of patron were
And truth I was at home, chillin on the 360
Knowing if I died them fake dudes wouldn’t miss me
Everybody’s best friends when they getting tipsy
But when the free drinks run they seem to jet quickly

So you should put your hands up, hey
It ain’t perfect but we be doing okay
I’m living proof you could do what you never thought
And best believe it’s the truth that you hear me talk

Bro you should put your hands up, hey
It ain’t perfect but we be doing okay
I’m living proof you could do what you never thought
And best believe it’s the truth that you hear me talk
