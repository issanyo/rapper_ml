Yeah, yeah, I'm high upon a new wave of confidence
I'm trying to ride it to a few different continents
Known in the country I am from but anonymous
To most of the populous in dominant
Market places, I'm from New Zealand and I use to seeing different faces
And they don't ever turn the radio to different stations
I gotta do it though cause mom is getting sick of waiting
When I was young she used to tell me "Have some fucking patience"
But she loved the baby boy raised the guy like I'm on roids playing with the toys
I'm grateful for the voice I've been given
Big boy now my purple whip about to have all the shutter bugs flicking
Straight sippin' vodka soda with the twist in
Jamaraqio playin I don't say it should be different it's still hip hop in the vein
Smirnoff in the brain, always been a cool dude I'll let you know if it change

I'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday
Ain't letting all the bullshit get in my way
Know that I stay caught in a daze
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze
Im in a good mood don't mess in my high, things are looking up
You can see in my eyes, so you know I'm
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze

Bitch im caught in a daze, holdup with these police again
... and these vehicles we ...that's why they hate
Custom colors is my ... in up on 60's
If you ever trying to find my I'd probably be ...with me
...open up baggy stuff like muffins
Out of dope enjoy your crisis ain't in my buddy so fuck it
I stuck em up and got on the highway, freddy gibbs get fried like everyday is Friday
In the place I reside I keep that iron cause them goons gonna be lurking
Keep my dope spot popping in my ...
Put me on a licking anybody move I'ma murk them knock them off their shoes and get their ass to ...
That's for certain, bitch you perpin' and flirting with death if you fuck with mine
Freddie ain't shit, he'll walk up and take your life in this life of crime

In this life of mine I took recent put my life on a line
Agents ask me for a statement I decline

I'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday
Ain't letting all the bullshit get in my way
Know that I stay caught in a daze
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze
Im in a good mood don't mess with my high, things are looking up
You can see in my eyes, so you know I'm
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze

It's all they can never chop me down, deeply rooted in the ground
Way I spit it's so profound, know the sound like some shit you heard before
But it ain't everyone's an artist now but I'm using different paint man
I'm using different egg for the story, this is guts this is glory
It's the rush of performing it's the slut when you're horny
It's the feeling that you get when you wake up in the morning
All that feeling that you get when the sun's dawning on another day
And you ain't seen your life another way
Working at the same job for next to nothing pay
Plugging away it's the dreams trying to hold this shit together
While the worlds tugging away, at the seams, see
Struggling it ain't no fame, one you looking back
But fuck if you ever again try to go through that
So i see it like a vintage car
You put your all in , and ride it out once then its in the garage
You talk about it with your friends as a symbol of the hard work
This is all a means to an end, lookin' at it through a lens that's rose tinted
It's probably why you hear it in my voice im so committed

I'm kicking back feeling good on a Friday
Ain't letting all the bullshit get in my way
Know that I stay caught in a daze
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze
Im in a good mood dont mess with my high, things are looking up
You can see in my eyes, so you know I'm
Caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze, caught in a daze
