Good morning

Far from a perfect young man, understand that I got faults
Like I took an elbow to the head
Sometimes my thinking ain't clear
One minute we were drinking beers, next thing she's in tears
Saying I don't have a heart, I don't put enough effort in
And tell her that is her fault and blame it on the estrogen
'Bout an hour later realized I'm insensitive
Took a sec to mess it up, spent a week mending it
Gotta learn some things are better not mentioning
Is she asks about the ex, tell her to forget the bitch
Tell her everything she does is better than she ever did
And if your ex still got your phone number then you flick the sim
Get a new phone cause the wrong text at the wrong time
Will have your girl reaching for your throat line
Should have let the past in the past cause is gon' fly
Now you're hanging our your own clothes, on the clothes line

So for all of my mistakes, all of my trippin'
All of those times that I ever went missing
Tomorrow while I wake up in the morning
Promise you I'll try to make up for it
So for all of my slip ups, times I don't ring you
My bad habits from when I was single
Tomorrow while I wake up in the morning
Promise you I'll try to make up for it

I tend to leave most things to the last minute
It's a bad habit leaving things half finished
I did it all through school, drove my mom crazy
Oughta know better, all the hidings that she gave me
But the hard headed never learn, lazy people never earn
All the talent in the world, doesn't mean a thing if you don't get a turn
See back in '05 dropped an album
Sat back, waited for the cash to roll in by the thousands
Thought we'd moved mountains just by showing up
Then I realized that I had to pick a shovel up
Man, this fucking sucks
That's what I thought at the time
Seeing our peers leaving us in the dust
They ain't got half our talent bro
But they got ten times our bank balance though
Then it clicked, I'd been using this gift as a crutch
You get back what you're giving, I ain't giving enough

So don't give me a puff, just give me a pen
I wasted too much time, I won't do it again
Anything worth doing is worth doing now
And that procrastination shit, I can do without

So for all of my mistakes, all of my trippin'
All of those times that I ever went missing
Tomorrow while I wake up in the morning
Promise you I'll try to make up for it
So for all of my slip ups, times I don't ring you
My bad habits from when I was single
Tomorrow while I wake up in the morning
Promise you I'll try to make up for it

I made many mistake in my 27 years
So many tears shed, all for my interference
Cold cases put long faces on my loved ones
Caught chasin' some women that were other than my number one
I'm in a slumper son, call me "told" status
Your reality and everything that really matters
My mentality I need to switch, so I can ought to beat the kids
Only thing I'm really thinking is my level of integrity
Devil on the left of me, telling me: sell it bro
Telling me: puff it bro; Telling me: stuff 'em bro
Telling me: rock it yo'; You can do whatever now
Forget about the ones who constantly be lettin' down
But you can bet now, life is at a shake up
... I caused the town to make up
Hang up the fake ???
I'm just tryna' wake up to a new day, so...

So for all of my mistakes, all of my trippin'
All of those times what I ever went missing
Tomorrow while I wake up in the morning
Promise you I'll try to make up for it
So for all of my slip ups, times I don't ring you
My bad habits from when I was singles
Tomorrow while I wake up in the morning
Promise you I'll try to make up for it
