[Verse 1: David Dallas]
You can tell by the energy I'm puttin' out
One day this will be a story that they write a book about
Since I started looking 'round
Wasn't comfortable with my surroundings
Wasn't really looking for a struggle but I found it
I should've known better but my ambition exceeded my reach
Doing what I'd always done, it never made me feel complete
So I had to switch the style up, like Banks said
But the money didn't pile up, only the bills did
Felt like I could kill shit
Got a girl to care for, father in the hospital
Mother to be there for, meanwhile I'm tryin' to be somebody over seas
Bookin' flights on my credit card, nobody else believes
Tank running on E, feeling like I couldn't breathe sometimes
Suffocated, couldn't see no light
At the end of the tunnel it all falls down
But we emerge from the rubble, yeah

[Hook: David Dallas]
I said it's on once again
Play a tune just to ease the strain
Pour another glass, drink away the pain
It's an everyday thing, trying to let it out
Troubles in my mind, trying to forget about

[Verse 2: David Dallas]
I use the music as a coping mechanism
Recognize that most people talk but never listen
Caught up in our own worlds
Nothing's ever given, that you can't handle though
Ain't a problem big enough for me to not smell so [?]
So I drive slow like 'Ye and Paul
Sit back, analyze, try to take it all
In, looking back at times when I gave my all
And it felt like the universe ain't playing ball
Shit hurt, couple tough breaks but they made me tougher though
Now my subwoofer's well equipped to hit another low
Ain't waiting around no more, now I just get up and go
Lace the Eddy E's up [?] pull the denim, buck it low
Got the crowd, Marv and me and Dash every other show
Money better so I can afford to bring a couple bros
On the road now
How quickly I forget these good times
But the memory of loss stays fresh up in my mind

[Hook]
I said it's on once again
Play a tune just to ease the strain
Pour another glass, drink away the pain
It's an everyday thing, trying to let it out
Troubles in my mind, trying to forget about
