Get up on my frequency
You can catch me broadcasting legally
This raw South Pacific scenery
What you see in me is nothing like them Peter Jack flicks
I never been the type to treat the truth like it's Mr. Fantastic
Just really so damn sick, no stick to the damn script
You think you're the man, I'm here to fuck up your plans quick
A little pedantic with the details can't hang with
Of this so-called ex persons speak my language
Don't write about this, listen up
You need to put your pens down 'cause you miss too much
'and the quest for getting bread ain't no telling where we'll be lead
Till I'm dead...another young Polynesian try to go with Instagram
I never donated the posies that didn't know my name
I done say Grace at the table, I'm thinking I changed
Been the same since primary school
Rolling on them BMXs, you were riding, fool
Thinking that it might be cool to play some Dr. Dre today
I was 'tryina learn this shit

Now I'm transmitting live
Feel the vibe, you can even ride
Or collide, you won't be denied
Tell a friend, could tell a friend
We're going in, transmitting live
Now I'm transmitting live
Feel the vibe, you can even ride
Or collide, you won't be denied
Tell a friend, could tell your friends
We're going in, transmitting live

On the TV up in high fidelity, don't give a fuck what they telling me
Catch a felony for real, they try to mute my voice
But can't monopolize the airwaves, now there's a choice
To let me hoist some of these issues on my shoulders
Nice getting colder, different role, different soldier
None of us can get a mortgage
Only thing that they reporting is some E Channel flings
All the music they recording sounds like people can't sing
And an athlete can't swig without a PD allegation
My boy just got the not, on board with three applications
New degree, congratulations, getting accusations
When they try to cut him off, say he ain't on a hunt for jobs
It's like fuck it, dog, didn't sign up for this
Had to grab this mic and try some other shit
Me and my production clique took that off the bucket list
Years later, look at what we coming with

Now I'm transmitting live
Feel the vibe, you can even ride
Or collide, you won't be denied
Tell a friend, could tell a friend
We're going in, transmitting live
Now I'm transmitting live
Feel the vibe, you can even ride
Or collide, you won't be denied
Tell a friend, could tell your friends
We're going in, transmitting live
