[Verse 1]

All the way from the 278
Send a message through the grapevine, tell em who to hate
Man, I'm 'bout to have a great time, open up the gates
Feelin' like that dude Bill Gates, open up the safe
See a pretty chick, better grab her by the waist
If she thinks her heart's beating out her chest, it's just the bass
Make her go "Ga-Ga", try to poke-her-face
Hope she still looks good when you're in a sober state
Shit I'm going ape
This is Donkey Kong country
Probably gonna wake up feelin' like King Kong punched me
The air in here's like we just won the rugby
Off a last minute drop goal, shit is lovely
Might just put this Heineken down and have a bubbly
Might just ask for Pitbull songs in the club g
It's that kind of night though, we just goin' psycho
Middle of the stage with our eyes closed

[Hook]

We ain't got a care in the world what for
It used to be a dream but it ain't no more
So we can celebrate like there ain't no laws
If you're down to roll then say no more
Start lookin' at the ground
Lookin' at the ground
Go get another round
Left, Right, Left, yeah
Move it girl Left, Right, Left
Who knew that we could do it like this?

[Verse 2]

I feel a woop comin' on cuz
It's that sick I feel the Flu comin' on cuz
Suck it up like the dude with the bong does
If you've got somewhere to be, you're in the wrong bus
'Cos we're in it for the long-run
And there ain't no tellin' where we'll end up
Back in the day every song I had to censor
Snoop Dogg radio edits was the best ones
Gin and Juice, [?]
Writin' in my room, too shy to even send stuff
Now brands fall over themselves just to land us
A shirt or some shoes, free words for the dudes
Tryna' come around now, suck a dick, we ain't cool
I ain't never been a fool, too loyal to some though
And they try to play the card when royalties come bro
Walk through the fight-outs, in oil and gun smoke
Still they got the nerve to ask if Dave's the one though
Ask them "Can Usain Bolt run bro?"
"Can Dan Carter kick his [?] "
I ain't even tryna' unload
Wanna foot it with the boy, better lace-up your own bros

[Hook]

We ain't got a care in the world what for
It used to be a dream but it ain't no more
So we can celebrate like there ain't no laws
If you're down to roll then say no more
Start lookin' at the ground
Lookin' at the ground
Go get another round
Left, Right, Left
Move it girl Left, Right, Left
Who knew that we could do it like this?

[Instrumental]

We ain't got a care in the world what for
It used to be a dream but it ain't no more
So we can celebrate like there ain't no laws
If you're down to roll then say no more
Start lookin' at the ground
Lookin' at the ground
Go get another round
Left, right, left
Move it girl left, right, left
Who knew that we could do it like this?

[Outro]

Get on down, Papatoe better get on down
South Aucks better get on down
West Aucks better get on down
NZ better get on down
Twenty man, better get on down
Yeah!
