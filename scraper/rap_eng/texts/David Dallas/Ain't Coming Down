[Chorus]
Got enough to go around what goes up ain’t coming down
Baby I’m running it light it up, light it up
Puff that shit, if your girl playing fuck that bitch
There's forks in the road, but hands on the wheel won't let it go
Show you how, what goes up
Ain’t coming down, coming down

[Verse 1]
Swear I don’t’ give a damn, eighty five kilogram, 6 foot 2 complex of a little man
Always got something to prove nothing to lose
Dudes just browsing the net for something to do, I’m really not fucking with you
If Ain’t got no ambition bro then im cuttin you loose, it’s like Chris Brown chuckin the duece, I know this was street wear when they saw 'Ye chuck on a suit
Tell your girl come f*ck with the dude
NZ's finest, King David bitch, NZ's highness im in harlem now that's NZ's minus
Still I’m giving New York NZ-itis
That ill, that sick, that killer dog, make em all notice the D like im Dilla dog your girl eyeing my D like we've been involved, it's Ray Allen for three I can hit it dog
Spittin on it anyone who think otherwise
Why these other dudes stay writing lullabies
Can’t sleep on my shit keep you up at night
Can't cut the lights, but you love it right

[Chorus]
Got enough to go around what goes up ain’t coming down
Baby I’m running it light it up, light it up
Puff that shit, if your girl playing up, fuck that bitch
There's forks in the road, but hands on the wheel won't let it go
Show you how, what goes up
Ain’t coming down, coming down

[Verse 2]
They say I got the hemisphere on my shoulders
Now couple dudes acting colder
But I got this rum and cola, so fuck them I ain't payin 'em no mind
Extend your arm to shake, I'll extend my arm for a clothes line
I ain’t got no time, music is the slow grind
Cosigns don't mean shit when it's show time, sound so hungry dudes thinkin that I don't dine, you ain't busy livin bro maybe you should go die
Sounds harsh but I got friends in hospital beds, who would give it all to have your problems instead
So stop sweating the small stuff all could be yours cuz, im tryin to find a place to rest my head on the tour bus
I do this for all us,shy half-cast in the class scared to try but dont wanna come last
Who woulda thought man, mum thinks rappers just talkin'
Yanks mention Oaktown when I say Auckland, nah there ain’t champagne bottes uncorkin', I’m still on the beers with a couple of my horsemen
Still doing the half the things, People just talking, runnin' in the shoes motherfuckers couldn't walk in

[Chorus]

[Verse 3] - Buckshot
The life of a hustler, street survivor I have acomplished constant trials and tribulations my patience, prove...we are an oasis
Face it
Melaton mind criminal crime, peace on my head mean peace of mind when, I don't gotta see no violence, read no violence
Got.... me no island when I say I stay high in the trees
Eye on my enemies dying to squeeze, see OP see OG's and hope we OD for dope and more cheese, rats in traps they call traps perhaps they all black and back they own fact but, fall back dont fall off, fuck swag when you died and the black bag hauled off
Nine eleven dialing for heaven they wildin milk and honey its funny the devil is smilin’
With a smirk ...jerk .. get it work get it ..

[Chorus]
