[Hook]
It's all the same old story
The way they come and go
This revolving door ain't for me
I ain't tryna fit in no more
No more

Keep on actin like you up on some shit
I'm done tryna fit in
Don't try tell me about what's cool or not man
I'm done tryna fit in
Looking like the next man you a yes man
I'm done tryna fit in
Done tryna fit in
Done tryna fit in
Dial 1-1-1 I'mma kill it real quick

[Verse 1]
I'm done
Ain't holding my tongue for, no one
Ain't tryna be down
With this crowd, or that crowd
Sitting on Pitchfork tryna figure out
What's good, what's hot
Showing off to your friends like you're top notch
Last year man you were into pop rock
Saying that Drake is a soft-cock
Now you at his show with a top-knot
I've not got time for the lip service
Calling that shit wack is a disservice
To the word wack
It's worse
Stop writing cheques that you can't cash, on a big purchase
It's not really worth it
Know the way that I act might make people nervous
From a land more known for the sheep than the beats
But I still ain't going where I'm herded
Ya heard it

[Hook]
It's all the same old story
The way they come and go
This revolving door ain't for me
I ain't tryna fit in no more
No more

Keep on actin like you up on some shit
I'm done tryna fit in
Don't try tell me about what's cool or not man
I'm done tryna fit in
Looking like the next man you a yes man
I'm done tryna fit in
Done tryna fit in
Done tryna fit in
Dial 1-1-1 I'mma kill it real quick

[Verse 2]
Don't care like I used to
These days feeling more neutral
Just being truthful
Seen dudes tryna flex but
They hop on a wave like it's the next bus
And it really gets messed up
When they just buy things they've seen 'Ye copping
You don't birth trends
You're not popping
Brad and Angie, mostly adopting
I've put that phase in a coffin
Being on my own buzz ain't no problem
Dave don't login
Fuck your timeline
Got better things to do with my time
Get paid, write rhymes
Catch Federer games from the sidelines
Go fine dine with the wife, sipping on white wine
Play Xbox Live in the nighttime
Nobody gonna dim my shine
Nobody gonna kill my buzz
These dudes say peer pressure is a bitch
That's why we are not peers cuz
Type of thing that'll end up in tears cuz
Fuck a bandwagon around here cuz
Used to "wanna be down with the cool kids"
Had to do it big guess I outgrew shit
