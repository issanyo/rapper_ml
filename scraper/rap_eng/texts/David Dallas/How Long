How long
How long

Pour another drink, I don't do Patrone, mix this soda with this vodka
It's me in my zone, don't give me a speech, I don't wanna know
You should tell your friends to leave now, we should be alone
Don't tell me I'm wrong, just tell me how long
How long must I wait if we both want the same thing
All you gotta say is it's on

Girl, you're not no actress, come be an adult
Fooling no one, whose intelligence are you tryna insult
With that act, I'm a smart man when it comes to affairs of the heart, man
Real fly, I just take off, baby, I can't land either
When you hear me out your speaker, get you high, Wiz Khalifa
Till you thinkin I'm a keeper, could be at home playing Fifa
But I'm out here talking to you right now
Can't hear everything you saying 'cause the music's quite loud
Talking 'bout how you're a student, you're in UNI right now
Nod about your boyfriend and how you tryna lose him right now
Don't be stupid, don't be foolish, I'm not clueless right now
Talking about a slumber party, me and you should lay down
Ha, jokes, but a lot of truth is said in jests, certainly wouldn't mind be a fly on the wall
If you were getting dressed
And you thought about possible places you could rest your head tonight
And you probably thinking mine
Pour another drink, I don't do Patrone, mix this soda with this vodka
It's me in my zone, don't give me a speech, I don't wanna know
You should tell your friends to leave now, we should be alone
Don't tell me I'm wrong, just tell me how long
How long must I wait if we both want the same thing
All you gotta say is it's on

How long I gotta wait before we go on a date
I'm a baller but I got that mean D to penetrate
Generating all the winds, you and your mates all attend
You should bring them to the place, maybe we can get it in
Baby, with the pen I'm crazy, is anyone you hail
We can share a wild moment while we bumping Jessie Ware
Yeah, you got that sense in flare, that's so rare
I'm open, what you packing in the res, got my player card revoking
Smoking on the green, mixed with the codeine mixed with yacon apple
Had to tell me that you came right, hear you got a man
Well, he ain't like me right? Tell him you're with Zen, I break the kid and flee him right
See your life is boring, to me that's just a shame you're too good to not be soarin as high as aeroplanes
We both know your boy's a lame, what you doing? You should leave him
You play them wicked games, what you doing for the weekend? Let me know!

Pour another drink, I don't do Patrone, mix this soda with this vodka
It's me in my zone, don't give me a speech, I don't wanna know
You should tell your friends to leave now, we should be alone
Don't tell me I'm wrong, just tell me how long
How long must I wait if we both want the same thing
All you gotta say is it's on

Man, I love the 'I can't say that I love but I can say that I love to ah
And I know I'm blunt but I'm just too grown for these games
Little too cold for these lames and I really do like your demeanor
Hey, your attitude is fiery and I feel airy in your presence
Baby, don't deny me of these blessings, wanna intertwine with all your essence
In the dark let's embark, let's go and escape the sun
Wanna hear you say my name, say my name in your native tongue
You looking delicious, oh, them thighs, I just wanna bite 'em
Know you feel a lil' bit guarded, a lil' bit faded, just don't fight it
See, I never was the player type
Couldn't see the point in being with a girl that you don't wanna make your wife only stay the night
I never do play, only when I'm single seein what I've been through strap wanna get some, cuttin the balls been lickin the ??
And I intend to make the most of this time we havin when we close, can we toast? So baby, grab a glass so you can

Pour another drink, I don't do Patrone, mix this soda with this vodka
It's me in my zone, don't give me a speech, I don't wanna know
You should tell your friends to leave now, we should be alone
Don't tell me I'm wrong, just tell me how long
How long must I wait if we both want the same
All you gotta say is it's on
Just tell me how long
