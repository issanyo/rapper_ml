D-Dog D-A
When stepping off the shoulders of a giant
Girl it's a long way down no more Kobe Bryant
You're stuck with no name clowns
Doing all the same rounds that you did before
Stars are blowing up my phone
Promoters kickin down my door
And don't think I'm bout thaw out
I'll be staying cool as fuck, cold blooded Reptar
You can't stretch the truth enough
To leave yourself convince that I'm not winning
Would make you insecure if you saw the grade of women
Vying for attention from the D-A-Double L
Claiming you're over us, thats a tough fuckin sell
And I ain't buying it, I'm applying this pressure to the game
Touch down to New York and life will never be the same, yeah

Bet you won't break my heart, no
Pain words spitting
Bulletproof living
Ten foot tall and I'm winning
Over before it starts
Bottles still tipping
Eighty proof sipping
Ten foot tall and I'm winning

You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
They say that life's a gamble still I thought we were a certainty
Really the only person capable of truly hurting me
You had me spinning now shit burned to the third degree
And no emergency call can treat those wounds
So I just pour me a drink, I'm from the old school
Didn't really talk about it, just kicked it with the bros
But time heals all wounds, eventually it goes
From painful to numb, just look at what I've become
My focus second to none, don't talk I just get it done
Give my heart to next to none now guess I know better
Start playing Geezy and Kellz, I'm a go getter

Bet you won't break my heart, no
Pain words spitting
Bulletproof living
Ten foot tall and I'm winning
Over before it starts
Bottles still tipping
Eighty proof sipping
Ten foot tall and I'm winning

All I wanna do is forget about you cuz all you ever do it bring me down
Stay outta my way cuz we ain't gonna make up, don't wanna see your face this side of town
