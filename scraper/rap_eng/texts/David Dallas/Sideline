[Verse 1]

Know the boy D-Double do it all day
Get the messing with his tracks, no foreplay
Seems simple now but it wasn't always
Used to sit up in the Pap High hallways
Teacher put me there saying that I talk to much
I thought I knew it all but I never knew much
I come to school late because my form room sucked
And we hang out by the canteen all through lunch
Young teen with a pac(men)tality
No dream I can make reality
All I care about is popularity
Trying to pass Jessica trying to get a touch
And a Mufti day try them with some new Chucks
Try them with some new Nikes or something
They didn't give a fuck about assignments or nothing
Didn't make music even though I loved it
Scared to try , high to shy get busted(?)

[Hook: Che Fu]

So I sit on the sideline
Despite in my time
If I could be in their shoes
The things that id do
But wishing won't get you know where
Dont be scared to go there
If you sit in my wake
Do it the right way
(yeah ya)

[Verse 2: David Dallas]

No I wasn't in the first fifteen
Wasn't in the choir, Never learned to sing
Couldn't play an instrument or pluck a string
Or the little rich kid whos dad bought him a car
A regular dude fading in to the background
Never took center stage, didn't really stand out
I remember school TalentQuest
We would hang out see this other dude rap
Then he'd be the man around E block
For like the next two weeks, scoring all of the chicks
While these Diggas my mom bought, are falling to bits
And I'm off in detention, for ignoring Mr. Smitts
And this bitch mocked me in class for having big lips
It was a hard knock life for a kid
Till I realized that a life isn't lived
If you're worrying about what other people might think of it
Don't sleep on this little boy's raps because he might be a hit

[Hook]

[Hook Extra: Che Fu]

Dont let it go by
There ain't no reason known why
Youre waiting around
You could be a star
Just watch from a far
Just stop waiting around

[Verse 3: David Dallas]

School finished did a little bit of growing up
But it wasn't like music was blowin' up
Shy as ever figured out I had to grow some nuts
And put my self out there, so they know whats up
And yeah I was pretty scared what they might say
They FENZ at it and say its bad in a nice way
Or I wasn't doing it the right way
But there ain't no right or wrong
Got one life to live and it ain't that long
So you gotta stay strong, gotta stay on
Another day sittin', wishin is another day gone
Another day doing dishes, or just mowing up the lawn
Coludve been another day that another star was born

[Hook]

[Outro: David Dallas]

Dont be scared man
Dont worry too much about what people are going to say
Because at the end of the day
The only person who still thinks about that stuff is you
Ya know?
