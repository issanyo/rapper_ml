[Verse 1: Mino & Mino/SeungHoon]
The blue sky only stays beautiful
But why am I only becoming shabby
I keep holding onto the unanswered phone

The melody flowing out of the phone is sweet
But why does it sound painful to my ears
It sounds like my heart that lost you screaming

[Pre-Chorus: JinWoo]
My song that longs for you
Mocks me that stays in the same spot
Already how many times

[Chorus: SeungYoon & Taehyun]
Why now
Why now when I’ve been left behind
Am I listening to this song's sad ending

Why now
Why now when you’re not by my side
Am I crying over this song's sad story

[Bridge: SeungYoon & SeungYoon/SeungHoon]
The color ring ring ring ring ring
That resembles me
The color ring ring ring ring ring
That resembles me

[Verse 2: SeungHoon & Mino]
Ring ring at your bed side, the ringing phone
Please just answer, don’t make me cry too
I keep on saying this is the last, last time but I keep calling
I walk the same streets we used to walk together

[Verse 3: Mino]
Your laughter still rings in my ears
And the whispered phone calls that lasted past dawn
Now I can't even hear it
Or hold onto it
Because of this melody that blocks me
But I still call again no matter what I promise to myself

[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun]
The song that I hear over my longing for you
Is that the answer for me?
I’ve been stuck in the same spot

[Chorus: SeungYoon & Taehyun]
Why now
Why now when I’ve been left behind
Am I listening to this song's sad ending

Why now
Why now when you’re not by my side
Am I crying over this song's sad story

[Bridge: JinWoo, SeungYoon/Taehyun & SeungYoon]
If I’d held your hand back then
If I’d held onto you when you turned away
Instead of this song
I could be listening to your voice I've been longing for

If I had been better
If I had been better to you
Instead of this sad song
I could be listening to your warm voice

[Outro: All & SeungHoon & Mino]
(The color ring ring ring ring ring that resembles me)
As the song ends and my heart crumbles
(The color ring ring ring ring ring that resembles me)
As the song repeats and my tears fall
(The color ring ring ring ring ring that resembles me)
As the time passes and I forget your voice
(The color ring ring ring ring ring that resembles me)
Even a single word is fine so PLEASE, SAY GOODBYE
