[Intro: Mino]
Woo, yeah
Yoon Jongshin and Winner
With a wild boy
Hahah
Let's go

[Verse 1: Seungyoon]
I can’t do it as much as you wish me to
I can’t handle you calmly
Oh seeing you endure so much
I clench my teeth and hold back

Sick and tired of my gentle gaze
My shy smile was only for the first time
Why did you only show up now
I clench my teeth and hold back

[Pre-Chorus: Seungyoon]
It brings both happiness and pain
Seeing you go crazy
Even if I want to quit
There’s no way out
Not now, not ever
Because of a poison like you

[Chorus: Yoon Jongshin/Seungyoon]
Wild Boy Wild Love for you
One way I can love you
You’re worth being crazy for
A once in a lifetime feeling
Wild Love for you

[Verse 2: Seungyoon]
You are mine
I’ll let everyone know
I won’t let anyone try to take you
Born to make me crazy
I’ll clench my teeth and protect you

[Verse 3: Mino]
All men restrain themselves
You Know
Pretending it isn’t addicting
You’re precious to me but I want to waste you

Nevermind, enough with the manners
I’m going crazy because of you
I want to hold back my explosion
Touch just for you
I touch you more than my phone
Let me hug you
Come over here
That’s right
Don’t take your eyes off
Don’t chuck out the love I give you
From now on, I’m going to do what I want
Rougher than sandpaper
Between us
Babe

[Pre-Chorus: Seungyoon]
It brings both happiness and pain
Seeing you go crazy
Even if I want to quit
There’s no way out
Not now, not ever
Because of a poison like you

[Chorus: Yoon Jongshin/Seungyoon/Mino]
Wild Boy Wild Love for you (I'm a wild boy)
One way I can love you
You’re worth being crazy for (worth it)
A once in a lifetime feeling
Wild Love for you

Wild Boy Wild Love for you (just follow me)
One way I can love you
You’re worth being crazy for
A once in a lifetime feeling
Wild Love for you

[Outro: Seungyoon]
I’ll let everyone know that you are mine
I won’t let anyone go after you
I’ll let everyone know that you are mine
I’ll let everyone know that you are mine
