Please leave me
Without saying anything
Please close those pretty lips
Don’t torment me
Without those traces that were so beautiful
That it swallowed the darkness
These regrets hurts me
Is this what you wanted?
To me, to me, why, why
When are you going to let me go?
You, you, why, why
My heart that once held you now have love thorns

I have love thorns
Are these the traces you left?
Will I not see you again? (Where you at?)
You, who I cannot touch
Should we stop for just a moment?
It hurts so much that I can’t endure it
Love thorns prick me (Kill myself)
So I won’t forget you in this pain

(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
Even when we’re mature when we love
After farewell, a child, child, child
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
Even if I blame you, who’s gone?
I’m the one in pain

Life is like a mayfly, It’s meaningless now
Now you’re a dream I cannot dream again
I become silenceto you
I become a breath that cannot be breathed comfortably
I still can’t forget your traces, your embrace
I would hug thorns
But you are now on top of a hill I can’t see
The blood that my feet leave behind as I follow
I still say goodbye and my heart still cries
Don’t leave things with me now, take everything with you

To me, to me, why, why
When are you going to let me go?
You, you, why, why
My heart that once held you now have love thorns

I have love thorns
Are these the traces you left?
Will I not see you again? (Where you at?)
You, who I cannot touch
Should we stop for just a moment?
It hurts so much that I can’t endure it
Love thorns prick me (Kill myself)
So I won’t forget you in this pain

(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
Even when we’re mature when we love
After farewell, a child, child, child
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
Even if I blame you, who’s gone?
I’m the one in pain

Just in case, don’t come back
You know that this will repeat again
We will end up talking like we did before
And make meaningless promises
And leave behind the lie of forever
Both of us will be alone again

I have love thorns
Are these the traces you left?
Will I not see you again?
You, who I cannot touch
Should we stop for just a moment?
It hurts so much that I can’t endure it
Love thorns prick me (Kill myself)
So I won’t forget you in this pain
