This feeling that comes to me
Every night without fail
For some reason I hate it
Then I try calling you again
Just in case you're feeling the same thing as me

I’m sentimental right now
I'm just looking at the ceiling
Even if I draw a picture on an empty space, it doesn't matter
I’m a bit sentimental
My small room feels so big today
Too big to lay down by myself

Bedtime story
Sing me a lullaby
Even if I want to sleep
The sheep keep running far away
The sounds of windows bumping
Into each other sound like thunder
Scaring me tonight
The clock strike midnight

The moon says hi to me
But I'm not happy to see it today
If I shake my head, I get dizzy
No one is next to me
My emotions are on low
I want to go to space
Who can understand this
I want to die. I don't mean it

This feeling that comes to me
Every night without fail
For some reason I hate it
Then I try calling you again
Just in case you're feeling the same thing as me

I'm sentimental right now
I'm just looking at the ceiling
Even if I draw a picture on an empty space, it doesn't matter
I'm a bit sentimental
My small room feels so big today
Too big to lay down by myself

I just want o be a star
That floats in the sky
That doesn’t do anything
But to shine on its own
My heart that became dark
With the night that became dark
I’m lonely, I'm precarious
Who will hug me?

I turn on some jazz music
That doesn’t suit this, like Ray Charles
As if I'm getting drenched in rain
The sound of music resonates
From my ears to my toes
Be careful, be careful SNS
Don't write stupid things because of your emotions
Don't be too rash and call your ex-girlfriend

This feeling that comes to me
Every night without fail
For some reason I hate it
Then I try calling you again
Just in case you’re feeling the same thing as me

I'm sentimental right now
I only stare at the ceiling
EVen if I draw
On a blank wallpaper
I'm slightly sentimental
My tiny room
Is so wide today
For me to lie in alone

I can't catch you
Even if I regret it now
I can't see you
No matter how much I try
We won't be able
To be happy forever, right?

I'm sentimental right now
I only stare at the ceiling
Even if I draw
On a blank wallpaper
I'm slightly sentimental
My tiny room
Is so wide today
For me to lie in alone

This feeling that comes to me
Every night without fail
For some reason I hate it
