[Intro]
My reflection in the mirror
Is so empty, as if there’s nothing there
I walk alone on the street
But this empty street feels so empty
Da ra dat dat dat dat dat dat
Baby don’t worry
After waking up from the dream that was you
This morning of reality feels so empty

[Verse 1]
As I face the morning, I realize once again
What wakes me up is not you but an alarm bell
Why is this damn bed so big?
In my vast desert of a heart, only a cold wind blows

I’m an empty shell, a coward without you
People around me look at me with pity
It kills me, no what a day
Before starting my day, without thinking I saw…

[Pre-Chorus]
My reflection in the mirror
(There’s no smile on my face)
Is so empty, as if there’s nothing there
I walk alone on the street
But this empty street feels so empty
(It’s quiet just like my heart)
Da ra dat dat dat dat dat dat
Baby don’t worry
After waking up from the dream that was you
This morning of reality feels so empty
(My heart feels so empty)

[Chorus]
It’s over, my love
Where are you?
Now we are just a memory
I was happy, don’t forget me, let’s meet again

[Verse 2]
Good days and sad days
Hard days and happy days
Now it becomes memories of the past
The me and you of the past are now over
It’s like I came back to reality
My reason to live is gone, my head is complicated
When I open my eyes in the morning, my heart feels empty
I feel the emptiness, just like I did before I met you

[Pre-Chorus]
My reflection in the mirror
(There’s no smile on my face)
Is so empty, as if there’s nothing there
I walk alone on the street
But this empty street feels so empty
(It’s quiet just like my heart)
Da ra dat dat dat dat dat dat
Baby don’t worry
After waking up from the dream that was you
This morning of reality feels so empty
(My heart feels so empty)

[Chorus]
It’s over, my love
Where are you?
Now we are just a memory
I was happy, don’t forget me, let’s meet again

[Bridge]
You still flicker before me when I close my eyes
But I’ll feel less and less as time goes by
I don’t regret it, I’m just a bit sad
I don’t miss you, I just long for you

I’m more and more afraid because I’m not like myself before
(There’s no smile on my face)
I’m scared to see myself getting weaker
(It’s quiet just like my heart)
Without you, even the air around me is heavy
(Da ra da ra ra ra ra dat)
After waking up from the dream that was you
This morning of reality

[Outro]
It’s over (it’s over)
My love, where are you? (Where are you?)
Now we are

Just a memory, I was happy (I was happy)
Don’t forget me (don’t forget me)
Let’s meet again
