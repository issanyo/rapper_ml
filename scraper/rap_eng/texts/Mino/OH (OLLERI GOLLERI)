Ay Ay Ay Ay
Take out all these soft piano rolls and drop some bass
Nah mean? I got this tongue to be speak roughly I'm MINO
Earllerigoallery earlle earlle rigoallery
Earllerigoallery earlle earlle rigoallery
Pointing fingers at me (ho) your jeers (ho)
Watch after I show up
Raise not your forefinger but your thumb bro
Earllerigoallery earlle earlle rigoallery
Earllerigoallery earlle earlle rigoallery
Catch me if you can, stick out my tongue and say “tease-ya!”
When I walkin down the street
All yall players got your tongue tied
Striking do strike me
Look like Oh Jimyeong (Korean comedian) it's all right I'm attention whore
Hell ye I'm a street fighter
Beating me up is no use it's just ridiculous Idol gentle man
Slap a high-five with upper generation
In the time line, it's matter of time to be pushed back
All day give lesson like one day is not enough
Since I learned several things, I don't know limits
U kna me? A spring day is gone
4 years after having gone through many hardships, nice day have come
This is the timing Who dare stop me
I'm steamed up my back is erupting and horn is growing
Who step on me my daily life is thrifty
If I have pen on my hand, I'm millionaire
Even crazy delightfulness become serious with one snatch of rap man

Halo appears like a firefly
I went all the way In front of my buzz, you're like a reed
The finger trying to teach me is now a pointing finger to point
Every day in front of MIC I've got nothing to lose like a gangster
Earllerigoallery earlle earlle rigoallery
Earllerigoallery earlle earlle rigoallery
Pointing fingers at me (ho) your jeers (ho)
Watch after I show up
Raise not your forefinger but your thumb bro
Catch me if you can, stick out my tongue and say “tease-ya!”
When I walkin down the street
All yall players got your tongue tied
