I’m not a boy anymore
But I eat like a boy still
My body’s an adult though
But I watch movies that’s up to 12
(Immature)

(That’s me) My mom’s tired of this
When do you grow up?
Why! I wanna be a Peter Pan
I’ll not change even if I grow my beard
People know when they see my ID card. (They know)
The world is saying you’re an adult.(It’s you)
Just like a donkey in water
Burden on my shoulder is heavy
( so heavy)
I can’t hold it. I don’t want to be mature I’m scared

OK I’m immature. like a crazy dog
I don’t worry about tomorrow. You do it at your home
OK I’m immature. like a crazy person
I’m going to be crazy without thinking anything
Yes I’m immature. Leave me alone
It’s okay to run more. We are still young
Yes I’m immature. It’s not your business
If you are going to push me away because I’m different, fuck off

I have lots of things to do
But I want to play even though I played all night
Everything’s all up to me now
But still I’m asking my parents to do it

I’m going to play hard so that I don’t regret anything
I’m in Wall street
Let’s spread
Our epinephrine
(Sell me this pen)
Don’t search past in 21 century
I’m busy playing right now
I don’t get scared
Call me immature not dad

OK I’m immature. like a crazy dog
I don’t worry about tomorrow. You do it at your home
OK I’m immature. like a crazy person
I’m going to be crazy without thinking anything

When time passes and I become old
I don’t care
Whatever people say, I’m immature
There would be no young days
But I don’t want to change forever. I’m immature
Yes I’m immature leave me alone
It’s okay to run more. We are still young
Yes I’m immature. It’s not your business
If you are going to push me away because I’m different, fuck off

OK I’m immature. like a crazy dog
I don’t worry about tomorrow. You do it at your home
OK I’m immature. like a crazy person
I’m going to be crazy without thinking anything
Yes I’m immature leave me alone
It’s okay to run more. We are still young
Yes I’m immature. It’s not your business
If you are going to push me away because I’m different, fuck off
