(Verse 1)
Lemonade Lemonade
Why you gotta hate
I gotta rate me 10 out of 8
Feeling good, feeling cool
Wanna do a pound or two of the weed that we grew
Just me and my crew
This story was meant to be a haiku but it's to wide to fit a line or two, ay

Started my day kinda cool kinda loose i turned up some music, my weed is therapeutic
Later my phone rang, it was my gang
”Do you wanna hang?”
I said hell yeah
On my way i sang, a happy tune
Like my life’s a cartoon
Like looney toons
Like flower that ah blooms yeah

But now i'm in the droptop doing hotbox
Making quick bucks
Want a quick suck
By the bitch down the street
Who made me complete when she played with my meat ay
It's now in the evening im gonna make her conceiving
You know that neiboughood bitch
That made my dick itch
The clock turned two
She asked for some shoe
I told her to stand in the queue
She knew that was true that i got a few
And it’s gonna grow
I told her that she's gotta go
And she gotta mow
Her pussy
That shit was bushy
Hella ushy

(Bridge)
Oh shit
Oh shit
Oh shit
Oh shit

(Verse 2)
Here comes the second verse
Bitch you better disperse
Cause if i ever diss you that would be a curse
When this song is done im just gonna pray
That i won't be haunted by the KKK
Then smoke some Mary J
Ay
This was just another day
Ay
