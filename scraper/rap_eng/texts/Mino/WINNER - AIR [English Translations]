When I open my eyes from a peaceful sleep
First of all, come closer, you protect me (hi)
My first breath gets filled up of your soft scent
You're my one and only diffuser

Your existence is like a filter against yellow dust
A resting place embraces me when I’m tired
Now the weight of worries and troubles
Becomes like a flying feather thanks to you

When I breathe in, I feel us becoming one in my body
Even when you're far away, even if you close your eyes
Hug me as if I'm right in front of you

Since when my dark mornings are this fresh?
It’s thanks to your scent
At the end of a tiring day
It's a given that I'll smile now
Because you're here
In my air (air, air)
Baby you in ma air (air, air)
Girl I can't survive for even 5 minutes without you
Baby you are my air (air, air)
Baby you are my air

You're the fresh air that embraces my body
Better than cashmere
Your breath, your scent fills my room
Making it a Utopia
Darkness cast my loneliness of the past
That full stop continued into a dotted line
That I followed and folded
You gave me a new tomorrow

Since when my dark mornings are this fresh?
It's thanks to your scent
At the end of a tiring day
It's a given that I’ll smile now
Because you’re here
In my air (air, air)
Baby you in ma air (air, air)
Girl I can't survive for even 5 minutes without you
Baby you are my air (air, air)
Baby you are my air

I might be taking you for granted
You don’t even know that I'm here
But without you, I can't breathe
So baby please stay with me

Since when my dark mornings are this fresh?
It's thanks to your scent
At the end of a tiring day
It’s a given that I'll smile now
Because you're here
In my air (air, air)
Baby you in ma air (air, air)
Girl I can't survive for even 5 minutes without you
Baby you are my air (air, air)
Baby you are my air

Hands up in the air
So we can cover the sun over there
Let me raise the tension
So you'll stop being shy and dance

Hands up in the air
So we can grab that cloud over there
Hands up, let me shake my hand
So you'll see me even if you're far away
