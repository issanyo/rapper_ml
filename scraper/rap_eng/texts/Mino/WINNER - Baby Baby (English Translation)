Baby Baby I hate this night
Baby baby I hate being alone
Hey girls If you are not busy
Could you please stay the night with me?
Oh baby I’m not asking you anything
Just let’s have a chat

My friends What are you doing tonight
Why don’t you drink with me tonight
Oh you are busy? Then maybe next time
Let’s hang out anyway

Baby baby I hate this night
Baby baby I hate being alone
Let’s spend this lonely night together
Let’s forget everything and let’s get drunk
Baby baby I don’t like being alone

I’m lost on the bed SOS
I’ve sent so many what’s up texts
Crouching in, I feel like I’m becoming so little
This silence is louder
Than noises in the world shut up

In the streets there are so many girls
As if they are poured like rains
But I don’t get soaked!
Do I have an umbrella on my head?
Dawn is too long
And your reply is too short like poem
If sun rises
I’ll sleep just like that

Baby baby I hate this night
Baby baby I hate being alone
Let’s spend this lonely night together
Let’s forget everything and let’s get drunk
Baby baby I don’t like being alone

As time goes by
Longing for love is getting bigger
I can’t do anything else
Please save me from this

Baby baby I hate this night
Baby baby I hate being alone

Let’s spend this lonely night together
Let’s forget everything and let’s get drunk
Baby baby I don’t like being alone

Baby baby I hate this night
Baby baby I hate being alone
Let’s spend this lonely night together
Let’s forget everything and let’s get drunk

Baby baby I don’t like being alone
