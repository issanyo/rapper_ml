I really can't stay - But baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away - But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight
To break the spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Oh, but it's cold outside
I simply must go - But, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no - But, baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been - How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm - Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious - Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical storm
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Oh, your lips are delicious
Maybe just a cigarette more - Never such a blizzard before
I've got to go home - But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - I'm thrilled when you touch my hand
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me?
ByThere's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that hold out
Ohhh, baby it's cold outside
