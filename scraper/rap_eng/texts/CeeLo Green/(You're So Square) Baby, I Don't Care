You don't like crazy music
You don't like rocking bands
You just wanna go to a movie show
Sit there when holding hands
You're so square but I don't care

I don't why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square but I don't care

You don't know any dance steps that I do
You only know I love you
Baby, I do, I do [Incomprehensible]

I don't why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square but I don't care

I don't why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you, baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square but I don't care
