[Cee-Lo Green]
Who should I be?
Whether I am good or bad, should lead us both to be
So I pray for the rain
And if I had her every day, I'd still praise her the same...

All it takes is the moonlight, and as long as the weather's fair
Reacts through a river, romance by the evening air
A fragrance on her flesh, this is who she is, don't apologize
You are to awe but you'll only have to be beautiful in the beholder's eye

Won-der-ful wild-flow-er
Op-en up, let me see
Se-xy is, in seaaaason
Share your sun-shine with meeee

[Cee-Lo Green]
The picture is perfect, a keepsake cause the occasion's rare
It's poetry in motion, I'm just proud to say that I was there
To pull her out of the ground, standin out in the crowd, oh my how she's grown
Hold her with both my hands, and put her right on the table when I get her home

[Cee-Lo Green]
Show those pretty colors baby
Show them all to everyone
Everybody's got a
Little light under the sunnnnnnnn...
