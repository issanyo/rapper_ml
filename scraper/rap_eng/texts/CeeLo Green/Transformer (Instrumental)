I, I, I, I I I
Know how to transform
I transform
I transform
I'm a transformer

I, I, I, I I I
Know how to transform
I transform
I'll transform
I'm a transformer

I'm just being myself
Plus I gotta be me too
Silly of me to think that
I couldn't bring myself to be you

Ah but behold there is benevolence
Behind this but don't stare though
Be careful cause I'll kill you
With kindness

That why I'm dressed quite neatly
Cause it's easy and discreetly they seek me
And when they reach me and see me
They believe me completely

I'm a real live wire I ain't lying
If it's between me and you I ain't dying
I can transform, I can transform, I can transform
Without even trying

I, I, I, I I I
Know how to transform
I transform
I transform
I'm a transformer

I, I, I, I I I
Know how to transform
I transform
I'll transform
I'm a transformer

Now I'm someone else
Now someone can be me too
Behold the beautiful and bold everyday I wake up to be new
Ah but its simple but they still can't understand why
I think I can, I think I can, I think I can (or can I?)

I'm a microchip off the old block
And you know not but I was a robot
And I sold rock and you would get for sho shot
With a gold Glock, boy I rode pac

Something that you won't see again
What the hell might as well be a friend
I can transform, I'm a transformer
No telling who I will have to be again

I, I, I, I I I
Know how to transform
I transform
I'll transform
I'm a transformer

I, I, I, I I I
Know how to transform
I transform
I'll transform
I'm a transformer
