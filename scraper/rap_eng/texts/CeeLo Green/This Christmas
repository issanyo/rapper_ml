Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas

Fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do
This Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas, will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

It's gonna be your special Christmas
Ooh yea

The fireside is blazing bright
And we're caroling through the night
And this Christmas, will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

It's gonna be your special Christmas
Ooh yea

Ohh, shake a hand, shake a hand
It's gonna be your special Christmas
I've got you baby
Merry Christmas time
I love you
This Christmas
