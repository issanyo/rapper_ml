Well, I've wandered around after a hour of work
And I'm waiting to meet her for weeks
The ghost of a girlfriend appear in my room
I can still smell her perfume in my sheets
But that's not her in my bed though she's out on the town
And I don't want anyone to see
There's a tattoo of my name on her body but honestly
The man holding her hand isn't me
Oh honey, how could you regret me
When you can't even forget me?
Babe, it's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long
Oh, okay, say that you love me
I think of you all night long
Still thinking of you all night long
I thought that once you had one, you had every woman
Until I lost this legendary woman
Now I'm sure that they don't make' em like her anymore
So please, baby, please lover
Let's find a way to forgive each other
I've gotten around ever since you've been gone
Without you I'm still alone
Oh, how can you regret me
When you know you can't forget me?
It's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long
Oh it's okay, say that you love me, okay
I think of you all night long
Still thinking of you all night long
I make mistakes, I'm only human
And I am not ashamed to say
That you are the one
Babe, it's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long
Babe, it's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long
And it's okay, all night long
Say that you love me all night long
Ooh, say you love me
