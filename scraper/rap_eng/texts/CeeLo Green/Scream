[Verse 1]
Some say stories don’t always end perfect
That’s imperfect
Cause I can show you how to make your worst day
Feel like your birthday
The kind of funny only you can discover
If you’re interested

[Pre-Chorus]
Do what I do and please join me!

[Chorus]
Get down, get up, get in the out
Hope you ain’t in a rush, we’re gonna be here for a while
Hey hey, jump around and sweat!
Where’s the loudest section?
(Right here!)
Where’s the loudest section?
(Right here!)
Old people you should just leave
'Cause me and the kids gonna scream!

[Verse 2]
It’s all about illumination
That’s what’s based, in option
Don’t you know every single dream is what chasing?
But that is amazing
’Cause it’s okay to be you and to be other
Oh are you listening?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Just dance, and don’t you let nobody get in your way
Hey you
I don’t care what they do or what they say
Well, unless I guess the short and the mother
Get them by the wrist
Then make them do what they do in this place to be
And see!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yea, yea, yea, uh
You know what this, you know just what it is
It's Despicable me... [repeating]
