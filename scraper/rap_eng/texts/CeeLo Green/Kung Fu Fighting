Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoah

[Chorus]
Everybody is kung fu fighting (hoo! huh!)
Your mind becomes fast as lightning
Although the future is a little bit frightening (little bit frightening)
It's the book of your life that you're writing (life that you're writing)

You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay
You could be a work of art (ha!)
If you just go all the way (look out)
Now what would it take to break (chee!)
I believe that you can bend
Not only do you have to fight (hoo!)
But you have got to win

[Chorus]
Everybody is kung fu fighting (hoo! huh!)
Your mind becomes fast as lightning
Although the future is a little bit frightening (little bit frightening)
It's the book of your life that you're writing (life that you're writing)

You are a natural (ooo)
Why is it so hard to see (yeah)
Maybe it's just because (ooo)
You keep on looking at me (huh!)
The journey's a lonely one (ooo)
So much more than we know (yeah)
But sometimes you've got to go (ooo)
Go on and be your own hero

[Chorus]
Everybody is kung fu fighting (kung fu fighting)
Your mind becomes fast as lightning (hoo! hah!)
Although the future is a little bit frightening (little bit frightening)
It's the book of your life that you're writing (life that you're writing)

You're a diamond in the rough (ooo)
A brilliant ball of clay (yeah)
You could be a work of art (oh!)
If you just go all the way (yeah)
Now what would it take to break (ooo)
I believe that you can bend (yeah)
Not only do you have to fight (ooo)
But you have got to win

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting (kung fu fighting)
Your mind becomes fast as lightning (yeah, yeah)
Although the future is a little bit frightening (little bit frightening)
It's the book of your life that you're writing
