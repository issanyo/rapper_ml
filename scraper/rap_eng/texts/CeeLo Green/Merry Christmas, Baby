Merry christmas, baby

Bought me a diamond ring for christmas
I feel like i'm in paradise

I'm feelin' mighty fine
I got music on my radio
I'm feelin' mighty fine girl
I got music on my radio
I feel i'm gonna kiss ya
Standing beneath the mistletoe

Santa came down the chimney
Half passed three
Left all them good ol' presents
For my baby and me, yeah

I'll love you baby for the rest of my life

Waiting on you
To just come on home
