[Verse 1]
Now, I can sing you the storyline
And if you like my story, fine
But ain't none of the glory mine
See, my life was a lonely one
And I was still momma's only son
With no idea what I'm gon' become
And I didn't have long to know
That you don't have to be grown to go
I could have died so long before
Then, I finally saw the sign
And I made it on down the line
One step at a time

[Chorus]
I feel better
I can smile at it now, I feel better
Oh, better
And, even a little, is still better
Oh, have mercy on me

[Verse 2]
Oh, it's probably plain to see
That I got a whole lot of pain in me
And it will always remain in me
So cold, it's a cryin' shame
Yet here I am, tryin' again
'Cause I refuse to die in vain
The circumstances put soul in me
And there ain't no holdin' me
I've got a heart made of gold, in me
Huh, can you believe this is where I've been?
And when adversity comes again
I'll deal with it then

[Chorus]
I feel better
I can laugh at it now, I feel better
Oh, better
And, even a little, is still better
Oh, have mercy on me

[Verse 3]
I said, everything's fine, you can take your time
What would be on your mind, if you knew you was dyin'?
I would wanna just feel this one more time
I said, everything's fine, take your time
What would be on your mind, if you knew you was dyin'?
I would wanna just feel this one more time
I wanna thank you, morning sun
I wanna thank you, lonely gun
Now, I know I'm not the only one
I - I wanna thank you, friendly ghost
When all the calls were close
It seems like you cared the most
I - I wanna thank you, Mom and Dad
For hurtin' me so bad
But you're the best I ever had
I - I wanna thank you
