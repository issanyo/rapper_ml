[Verse 1]
It's looking like a limb torn off
Or all together just taken apart
We're willing through an endless fog
We are the everliving, ghost of what once was

[Chorus]
But no one
Is gonna ever love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

[Verse 2]
And anything to make you smile
It's a better side of, of you to admire
But they should never take so long
Just to be over then, back to another one

[Chorus]
But no one
Is gonna ever love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

[Bridge]
Someone should have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now
It's tumbling down hard

[Verse 3]
Did anything to make you smile
You are the ever-living ghost of what once was
I never want to hear you say
That you're better off, or you liked it that way

[Chorus]
'Cause no one
Is gonna ever love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do

[Bridge/Outro]
They really should have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now
It's tumbling down hard
