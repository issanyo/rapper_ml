[Verse 1]
This could be one of those days
When we must go our separate ways
Scared for you to be out of my sight
Cause you never know, you might

[Chorus]
And I carry this, it's heavy
And I miss you already
You were perfect, babe

[Verse 2]
My time will come, yours, too
I'd gladly go before you
I hope you live forever
Or, baby, we can go together, ah
It'll be perfect, babe

[Chorus]
And I carry this, it's heavy
And I miss you already
You were perfect, babe

Perfect
