You speakin my language

You speakin my language

The Language of Love

You speakin my language

Verse 1
She know without sayin
And goes without sayin
This is where you should be

Go get your know
Leave that one alone
That beautiful Stranger belongs to me

Break
Your heart is calling
I can hear you
Wanting me to come be near you

It's just like magic
Im starting at it
Please tell me you agree

Chorus
You speaking my language
The Language of Love
You speaking my language the
Language of Love

Verse 2
What's happening to us
Somebody lets do us
Which is very nice slow.....

She's not hear alone
But she's grown
And it's so nice to know

Break
There's a wanting
There's a needing
Don't you ever stop believein

And I pinch myself
I curse myself
If you decided that you should go....

Chorus
You speakin my language
You speakin my language
The Language of Love
