You don't like crazy music
You don't like rockin' bands
You just wanna go to a movie show
And sit there holding hands
You're so square
Baby I don't care

I don't why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Baby I don't care

You don't know any dance steps that I do
I only know I love you like I do, I do, I do

I don't why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Baby I don't care
