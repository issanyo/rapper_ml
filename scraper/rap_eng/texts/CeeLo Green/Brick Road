[Intro]
Cookin'
Cookin'
Can you smell me?

[Verse 1]
Shot down but I levitate
An idle mind starts to contemplate
Razor blades making lifelines
Now I'm staring at an empty plate

[Pre-Chorus]
And it tastes, oh so bitter sweet
And I basically made something to eat, oh

[Chorus]
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's what you gotta do, when you gotta stay afloat
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
Popo always come knocking at my door
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
The one thing that I'll never be is broke
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's the realest shit I ever smoked

[Verse 2]
You never know where to find me
Don't use a phone, thank you kindly
Another soldier has fallen
Don't worry, I will catch his body
All the best for your dreams, baby
Say a prayer, get on your knees, baby
Young Lo will make it flip right quick
I'll be God damned if I don't die rich

[Pre-Chorus]
And it tastes, oh, so bitter sweet
And I basically made something to eat, oh

[Chorus]
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's what you gotta do, when you gotta stay afloat
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
Popo always come knocking at my door
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
The one thing that I'll never be is broke
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's the realest shit I ever smoked

[Bridge]
When it comes to this, no one is better at this than me
When it comes to this, no one is better at this than me
I flick my wrist, flick my wrist, flick my wrist just once
I flick my wrist, flick my wrist, flick my wrist just once

[Pre-Chorus]
And it tastes, oh, so bitter sweet
And I basically made something to eat, oh

[Chorus]
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's what you gotta do, when you gotta stay afloat
I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
Popo always come knocking at my door
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
The one thing that I'll never be is broke
Said I'm cookin' up, cookin' up, cookin' up dope
It's the realest shit I ever smoked
