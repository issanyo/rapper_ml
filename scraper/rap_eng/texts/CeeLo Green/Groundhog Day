[Hook: repeat 2X]
It' just the same shit different day
We pretend to work while they pretend to pay
Daydreamin' all day after day
Every minute, every hour, that I'm spending awake

[Verse 1]
Blue collar
Green dream
Roll it up and blow steam
Clocks tickin'
Pops trippin'
Different day
New scheme
No jobs rent due and all it got is hope saved and if i feel man enough atleast i got these ropes made
Super size super size
Tell mommy that note i left
I can hardly stay afloat but i can barely hold my breath
Im stinky stinkin rich
Why should i think otherwise
We are hardly sober so i think i need a shot
Cup of grim or some gin


[Hook: repeat 2X]
It' just the same shit different day
We pretend to work while they pretend to pay
Daydreamin' all day after day
Every minute, every hour, that I'm spending awake

Let's get buck, raise em' up before the night is up
Speakers blast, people dance, time to have some fun
Get some ass, have a laugh, watch the sun come up
Make it last cause tommorow's back to offices
Huh...That's right, that's right, that's right
All I wanna do is take a load off tonight get high(repeat)

[Hook: repeat 2X]
It' just the same shit different day
We pretend to work while they pretend to pay
Daydreamin' all day after day
Every minute, every hour, that I'm spending awake

I used to wake up in the morning and hop on the express
Yellow line Q, headed towards a job with a desk
Workin for checks, walkin asleep, dreaming concepts
Zombie rushin to get a seat before the train jets
Pack em in'
Nice and tight headed downtown to fight
Any and everyone that step in front of my 9-5
Get it right, clock em' in homie yo that's what happenin
Maybe I'm just a robot functioning off of oxygen
My daddy told me it's routine
Feelin a little stuck when you ain't livin your dreams
Right now it seems there's no escape
Feelin so outta place
Got caught in the system on some matrix database

[Hook: repeat 2X]
It' just the same shit different day
We pretend to work while they pretend to pay
Daydreamin' all day after day
Every minute, every hour, that I'm spending awake
