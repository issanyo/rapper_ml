Niggas coming through with that violence
Niggas mixed two with that molly
Ain't got nothing to do with that money
I'm coming through with that chopper
Niggas coming through with that violence
Just bought a gun that's silent
Police grab me about that violence
Ain't knew nothing about it
Hop out my car, it's cloudy
I'ma hunter nigga, big bounty
Ain't nothing funny but money
Lil fuck nigga, get money
We come through and we redrum it
Burn a nigga off in the dark
(?)
Hop out and then get it sparking
Remember when I used to watch Barney
Now I'm running around with my army
Get it to you however you want it
I am 2Pac for the moment
Nigga told me I got talent
Know when I used to be abandoned
Ready to make that damage
Two, him him and him
Bitch in Canada named Candice
Bitch in Paris named Janet
Naw baby, I don't eat candy
Ain't shit sweet but sweet damage
Bitch in Canada named Candice
Bitch in Paris named Janet
Naw baby, I don't eat candy
Ain't shit sweet but sweet damage
