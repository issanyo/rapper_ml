[Intro: T.I. & MacBoney]
Whatchu wanna do wit em on this one Mac?
The Pimp Squad Click gotta spit sum pimp shit
I don't know if I got it in me
Got to
Well I tell you what this as close to some pimp shit I can get

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Inna pitch black six, kicked back lettin' the purp blow the
Fire from the dro make the middle of my shirt glo'
Thinkin how I mighta loss the one I always searched fo
The one to make me stay at home and one to go to church mo
Money and the bundles ain't nothin we can hurt fo
Blow a hundred thou at will whatchu wanna work fo?
Keys to the crib whatchu worried bout a skirt fo
You the woman I put all them women out da vert fo
Everyday I spent witchu I swear it make the earth
So much mo'worth livin' now you gone and it hurt so
Bad, and it's sad but it's cool I ain't mad
I still got love fa you boo
I'm just glad that you found what you need
But I adored you believe me
Astounded cause i neva believed you'll leave me
In this million dolla crib 13 karat ring
What it cost me to drive
Imma king without a queen

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Come back this way
Can't spend another day without you
Walk this way
Don't you like our life
I see about you
Please say yes
Darlin' please say yes, tonight
And for the rest of your life

[Verse 2: MacBoney]
Nah imma bout to tell you all the things that I won't do
Stayin' up all night worried tryna call you
Mindin' ya business tryna find out whatcha into
Askin stupid questions tryna aggravatin' ya mental
I got my own business and I got my own friends too
I just hope the money and the fame don't change you
Let dat good shit go to waste it be a shame too
Dats just like cuttin' off the wings of an angel
A hundred thousand songs like this couldn't explain you
The best trainer known to da' world couldn't tame you
I just wanted to figure out ya name when i came thru
Money ain't a thang shit I ball wit the best boo
Head up like some purple thrax hold it in your chest boo
Think bout you layin' in my arms as I caress you
Let yo self go MacBoney will protect you
It's best you weigh out all ya options cause I'm choosin' you

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
Come back this way
Can't spend another day without you
Walk this way
Don't you like our life
I see about you
Please say yes
Darlin' please say yes, tonight
And for the rest of your life

[Interlude: MacBoney]
I'm sayin' baby
I call you every damn day
And you always give me the same excuse
You know, you gotta go to work
You gotta exercise (Goddamn bitch)
You gotta go do yo homework
I'm sayin' though baby
Just answer me this one thang
When do you fuck?

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
Come back this way
Can't spend another day without you
Walk this way
Don't you like our life
I see about you
Please say yes
Darlin' please say yes, tonight
And for the rest of your life
Come back this way
Can't spend another day without you
Walk this way
Don't you like our life
I see about you
Please say yes
Darlin' please say yes, tonight
And for the rest of your life
