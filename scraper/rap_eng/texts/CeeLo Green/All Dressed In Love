[Verse 1]
When you can wear what you feel
What do you wanna say?
Now love is a little number that you can wear each day
As long as you let me be the accessory
Simply send me on my way
Cause I love love
I look good in love

When it's been out of sight and out of mind for such a long time
That's how one forgets
So I reached in the back of my closet, pulled it out
And I tried it on and it still fits

Some cover their pain up with lots of MAC make-up
But I can't help but blush
Cause I'm in love
All dressed up in love

[Chorus]
I'm all dressed up in love
And I'm cool in the summer, warm in the winter! (I ain't cold)
I'm all dressed up in love
And I'm cool in the summer, warm in the winter!
Cause I'm in love
All dressed up in love

[Verse 2]
People are looking, some even staring
I know I'm glowing when they ask me what I'm wearing
See this old thing, it's great for any weather
My friend and I sit down and we both made it together
Now if you really want one of your own
I hope your shoes are made for walking
Cause I found love and you must find love

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Love
I found it!
Love is the thing, you know!
