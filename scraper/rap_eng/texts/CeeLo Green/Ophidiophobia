Invisibly a vagabond
Yeah, just tag along
Not one single care in the world
Not even in to carry on

They said there's a future ahead so
Gonna fly out there and see
Heh, I just smiled and said hello
And sat right next to destiny
I leaned over and asked him,"Would we be okay?"
He said that he wasn't at liberty to say

(Chorus)
Send me an angel, an angel
No sign of the times, instead I'll take it to mean
I'm a stranger, to danger
But I'm scared 'cause I swore
I saw a snake on a plane

"I'm tired of these mothafuckin' snakes on this mothafuckin' plane... I'm tired... I'm tired... I'm tired..."

I don't really have to know
Because I do have to go
You see, I understand that it's all in the plan
Just bask in the afterglow

I lie down terrified
It's not like I've never cried
I hope you know what you're doin'
I'm only human, damn, I've never died...

What can happen might
This could be my night
But actually, I'm havin' the time of my life

Chorus

I feel like a helpless child, As I taste the aisle- It's too bad to be true
Oh, maybe I could help, I'd fly this plane myself- That's the least I can do
As we descend slow, looked out my window, What a wonderful view
Oh, be patient, baby, keep on a-waitin, baby...I'm gonna make it to you

Chorus

"I'm tired of these mothafuckin' snakes on this mothafuckin' plane... I'm tired... I'm tired... I'm tired..." (Send me an
An-an-an...)
"I'm tired of these mothafuckin' snakes on this mothafuckin' plane... I'm tired... I'm tired... I'm tired..."
