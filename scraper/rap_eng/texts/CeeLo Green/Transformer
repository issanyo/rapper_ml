[Chorus]
I, I, I
I-I-I know how to transform
I transform, I transform
I'm a transformer
I, I, I
I-I-I know how to transform
I transform (I can do it), I transform (I can do it)
I'm a transformer

[Verse 1]
I'm just being myself
Plus, I gotta be me, too
Silly of me to think that I couldn't bring myself to be you
Ah, but behold, there is benevolence behind this
But don't stare, though
Be careful, 'cause I'll kill you with kindness
That's why I'm dressed quite neatly
'Cause it's easy and discreetly, they seek me
And when they reach me and see me
They believe me, completely
I'm a real live wire, I ain't lying (I ain't lying)
If it's between me and you, I ain't dying
I can transform, I can transform, I can transform without even trying

[Chorus]
I, I, I
I-I-I know how to transform
I transform, I transform
I'm a transformer
I, I, I
I-I-I know how to transform
I transform, I transform
I'm a transformer

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm someone else
Now, someone can be me, too
Behold the beautiful and bold
Everyday, I wake up to be new
Ah, but it's simple, but they still can't understand why
I think I can, I think I can, I think I can
Or can I?
I'm a microchip off the old block
You know not, but I was a robot
And I sold rock
And you would get, for sure, shot
With a gold Glock, boy, I rode Pac
I'm something that you won't see again
What the hell, might as well be a friend
I can transform, I'm a transformer
Ain't no telling who I'll have to be again

[Chorus]
I, I, I
I-I-I know how to transform
I transform, I transform
I'm a transformer
I, I, I
I-I-I know how to transform
I transform, I transform
I'm a transformer
