[Intro: Sonta]
You know, life is crazy
We all go through things that sometimes we can't control
We wanna see things changed that we don't have the authority to change
Just have hope, keep faith

[Chorus: Sonta]
Oh, yes, I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy, but that's okay
Just be hopeful

[Verse 1: Sonta]
I wish we could get it together
When my heart's up, instead we acting like Chicago's weather
I wish that we could love each other
Hug each other and realize we are sisters and brothers
And I wish that we could stop the killing
Pick a book up, be anti-violent and just stop the drilling
I wish I could bring my cousin back
Decrease the numbers of the deaths that are black-on-black
I wish we wouldn't follow trends
That we would wanna stand out and we wouldn't wanna blend
I wish we could realize the distractions
From what's important and be responsible for our actions
I wish the police would stop killing us
For no remorse and they get off, what's the point of a judge?
I wish my block crew would open their eyes
And see the block don't love you, it's just death in the skies

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Oh, I'm hopeful, yes, I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful

[Verse 2: Sonta]
I wish women would respect themselves
Realize that the kitty is priceless and protect their health
I wish men would respect us as well
Ladies, we need to stop buying all the dreams that they sell
I could give this message to all my brothers
If you wouldn't make her a wife, then don't make her a mother
We wouldn't depend on the government
They don't care about us no more than we care about them
I wish we gave each other more support
You can count on your hands the number of black-owned stores
I wish we generally cared more
We could really conquer the world, what we scared for?
That we would start to raise these babies right
Don't let them watch Love & Hip Hop, make them watch Nick at Nite
We could love each other 50/50
If Chicago came together, we'd would be a powerful city

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Oh, I'm hopeful, yes, I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful, yes, I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful

[Outro: Sonta & Faith Evans]
Yes, I am hopeful for today
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy, but that's okay
Just be hopeful
Oh, I'm hopeful, yes, I am hopeful for today
Take this...
