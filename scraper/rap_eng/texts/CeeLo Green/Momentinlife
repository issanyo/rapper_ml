[Intro]
[Kindred the Family Soul and Musiq Soulchild vocalizing]

[Verse 1: Kindred the Family Soul and Musiq Soulchild]
Have you ever had a day when
Nothing goes your way
All you do seems to be in vain
And everything is just a waste of your time

[Chorus: All singers]
But have you ever had that moment in life
Yeah, when everything is cool (yeah)
Didn't have to worry about the time (time)
It all went as it should
You were having the greatest moment in life
(yeah oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2: Kindred the Family Soul and Musiq Soulchild]
Don't you worry about the past cause
It's gonna be what it is
All that you can do is try to
Make your future beautiful (beautiful)
And let it be the greatest moment in life

[Verse 3: CeeLo Green]
I remember almost every December when we were critters
And Mama said that there was only one thing she could get us
But  God must have been with us
Cause it is heavenly joy
When you wake up Christmas morning to every toy
Then there's the birth of my boy
Here to inherit that rhythm
And when I see it in him, I ask myself what more can I give him
And I would love to but I can't spend every moment with him
It's just those big ole eyes that encourage me to keep on living
Hey (hey) , ooh, when I'm singing I'm sharing
Or rhyming, I'm shining my light
And all the love is blinding I still end up finding my wife
And all I can do is reminisce cause there is no rewinding my life
But the future so bright that it's almost blinding my sight

[Outro: Musiq Soulchild, Kindred the Family Soul and CeeLo Green]
It's like all a sudden your life is so cool
Cause everything in it is working for you
Your friends and your family are getting along
It feels like when you hear your favorite song
Or when you know that you got money to spend
You never want that moment to end
No, You never want that moment to end
No, You never want that moment to end
