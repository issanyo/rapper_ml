[Intro]
Come on
Come on

[Verse 1]
What are you so afraid of?
We are your family
Everybody's waitin'
So come on try to dance with me

[Chorus]
The groove is our guiding light to get us through the night
So hold me close and we will dance to the rhythm of life

[Verse 2]
Oh and I [?] lifetime is not waitin'
N-n-no, time's not waitin', n-n-n-no, no time's not waitin'
Either dance or die and that is the only ultimatum
N-n-no, time's not waitin', n-n-n-no, no time's not waitin'
So dance up on your fella
'Cause the beat is our borrowed time
We are inexperienced
A part of some grand design

[Chorus] + [Verse 1] + [Chorus]

[Outro]
Groove
The rhythm
Dance
The rhythm
Life
The rhythm
Think about that
