I brought home scars from the battle
But a woman’s scorn is worse than any war
In my absence her heart hadn’t grown any fonder
Apparently she’s forgotten what I’m fighting for

I said I would be
Behind enemy lines
Would’ve died a thousand times
And you doubt me
Without even thinking twice
My life I’d sacrifice
But you doubt me, why
And why not acknowledge me
When I’ve been a soldier for your love

I consider you my duty
I have not come all this way not to win
Persevering for our love’s survival
Living each day just to fight again

I said I went
Behind enemy lines
Would’ve died a thousand times
But you doubt me
Why, without even thinking twice
My life I’d sacrifice
But you doubt me
And why not acknowledge me
I’ve been a soldier for your love

I said I went
Behind enemy lines
Would’ve died a thousand times
But you doubt me
Why, without even thinking twice
My life I’d sacrifice
But you doubt me
And why not acknowledge me
I’ve been a soldier for your love

Ooh our love
