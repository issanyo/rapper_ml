If I could write one song to right all wrongs
I would, if I could
But in retrospect a little bad is good, mm-hmm
We all need what we want and don't want what we need, mm-hm
Life is bittersweet, bittersweet indeed, mm-hmm
Well I'm so human it is a goddamn shame... I'm your thing
And I make sure that I always keep me some pain- yessir
To remind me that I survived somehow- oh
Lord please don't let nothing steal me away right now- cause I wanna live!

Cuz I wanna hut two three four what the hell are you waiting for
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Now hut two three four what the hell are you waiting for
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Just live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Well I've struggled so hard that I survived
And it's a miracle that I'm still alive

Said stand up, everybody, uh this is your life
You gotta get it when you can y'all
Half rich for months is your knife
We can't forget about the brothers, the sisters, the lovers who ain't here
You only got one life y'all and I repeat the point it ain't clear
And if it ain't fair then what's stopping you from going
Do you not want to be responsible for knowing
Cuz ignorance is bliss
And ignorance is just so fucking ignorant you may even be ignorant of this
If you say so my Desoto's the significance of this
I'm good lookin still fuckin so fools dont make a dish
Light a candle for love blow it out and make a wish
And I hope I die happy like fish

Cuz I wanna Hut two three four what the hell are you waiting for
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Now hut two three four what the hell are you waiting for
Live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Just live (think about it are you sure you're really living)
Well I've struggled so hard that I survived
And it's a miracle that I'm still alive
Well I have struggled so hard yet I survive
And a little miracle that I'm still alive
