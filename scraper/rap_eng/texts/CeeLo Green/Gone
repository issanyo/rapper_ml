So why would you stay if its killing us both just to be here?
There's no more room to grow and you won't find yourself 'till you leave me
It's a beautiful world outside these walls
And I love you too much to hold you down
With my light shine.....
And its blinding you...so
G'on....get away.....leave me be
'cause I dont wanna see your face around here

So don't complicate it
I don't have it in me to hate you
I was there to be your freedom
I just want to be your faerie
And I try to teach you, but I can only stay for one more day
Then I am....
Gone....get away....leave me be
Cause I don't wanna see your face around here. (repeat)

There ain't nothing here for you if you stay
And its so hard to hear myself say
"go away"
Instead of " baby please stay just one more day"
I barely have the strength to leave you
And you don't wanna be with me
So go on (just get gone)
And leave me alone...

Cee-lo: that isn't true
Girl, how could you say what you not mean?
Oh we used to have such a hot thing
And I just can't go anywhere and be not seen
But for the love of you theres places I have stopped being
And don't make me start about the sweets and all the shopping
I mean God I even went out and got the ring
And its no cliche
Love is blind its in you Literally- stop seeing
But when you truly love someone, you wouldn't be shamed
And if I did not see you there, girl, I wouldn't have came
You must think i've got some strong shoulders 'cause thats where keep putting the blame
Whoever said f**ked up your head
Talking bout if you love somebody enough that you wouldn't have pain
