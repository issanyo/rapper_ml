I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo in so much space

And when you're out there without care
Yeah I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Mmm, I just knew too much
Oh

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
Well think twice
That's my only advice

Come on now, who
Who do you, who do you
Who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
Mmm, you really think you're in control?
No, no

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart
To lose their lives out on a limb
But all I remember is thinking
I wanna be like him
Yeah, yeah
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
I can die when I'm done
Oh, oh

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

Maybe we're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably
Yeah
