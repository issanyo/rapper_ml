Hey
Wait a minute
Hey

[Verse 1:]
I said baby
I love the way that you hold me
And you touch me like you know me
See I don't want nobody else
And I, I'm bout to offer all I can give him
Cause I'm a slave to his rhythm
I said I just can't help myself

[Bridge 1:]
Cause baby I love ya
And I trust ya
You don't have to worry bout nothing
Ooh I'm alive right now, look at me
And I want ya
No I need ya
And I'll do anything to please ya
I just want you to take control of me (take control)

[Chorus:]
I said hey (hey)
Show me how you want it now
(Do you) like it when I take it down
I got everything
And anything you need, I wanna bring it to you baby
Hey (hey)
Come a little closer Now
(Don't stop) wanna go another round
You got everything
And anything I need, want you to bring it to me baby

[Hook:]
Take Control of Me (take control of me)
Take Control of Me (take control of me)
Take Control of Me (take control of me)
Take Control

[Verse 2:]
I said Baby
I got to tell you how much I love It
The way you kiss my neck in public
I try my best not to blush
Even when, an argument comes around
You take the time to break it down
And you're never ever in a rush
(Never never never never never ever)

[Bridge 2:]
And I'm scared, and I'm nervous
Trying is always worth It
Ooh I'm alive right now, look at me
And I want him, and I need him
I'll find him, I'll forgive him, I'll feed him (ooh)
I just want you to take control of me (take control)

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Now if you feel what I feel, come and take control of me
Don't you know how you feelin' just take control of me
Cause you got my soul on fire and I feel just fine
You got what I Need
Na na na Na (Na na na na, hey hey hey)
Hey hey Hey! (Na na na na, hey hey hey)

[Chorus]

Take Control of Me (take control of me)
Take Control of Me (get closer to me)
Take Control of Me (take control of me)
Why don't you come a little closer

Hey
Na na na na, hey hey hey
Na na na na, hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
