[Verse]
What did you do, what did you say?
Did you walk, or did you run, away?
Where are you now, where have you been?
Did you go alone, or did you bring a friend?

[Chorus]
I need to know this 'cause I noticed when you're smilin'
Out in the sun, havin' fun and feelin' free
And I can tell you know how hard this life can be
But you keep on smilin' for me
(Girl, let me smile at you)
(Girl, let me smile at you)

[Verse]
What went right, what went wrong?
Was it a story, or was it a song?
Was it overnight, or did it take you long?
Was knowing your weakness what made it strong?

[Chorus]
Or all the above?
Oh, how I love to see you smilin'
And, oh yeah, take a little pain, just in case
You need something warm to embrace
To help you put on a smilin' face
Hey, put on a smilin' face
(Girl, let me smile at you)
(Girl, let me smile at you)


[Bridge]
Don't you go off into the new day with any doubt
Here's a summary of somethin' that you could smile about:
Say, for instance, my girlfriend, she bugs me all the time
But the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time

[Chorus]
I want to be you, whenever I see you smilin'
'Cause it's easily one of the hardest things to do
Your worries and fears become your friends
And they end up smilin' at you
Put on a smilin' face
