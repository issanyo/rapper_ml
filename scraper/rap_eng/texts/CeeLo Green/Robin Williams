[Verse 1]
Oh what a night, oh what a night, tears in my eyes, staring up at the sky in disbelief
"I've got a voice in my head, voice in my head"; that's what it said, all we really need is some comic relief

[Bridge]
But I'm afraid of not being able to laugh anymore (Oh)
What's life going to become once we don't have anymore heroes?

[Hook]
We don't know what the next man's going through, wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams; we've got to laugh the pain away
We don't know what the next man's going through, wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams; we've got to laugh the pain away
Laugh the pain away

[Verse 2]
John Belushi knew you and me better than we knew ourselves and we all listen to Richard Pryor (Ya)
I think don't make Philip Seymour Hoffman often, now he's one of the things we lost in the fire (Lord, yes)

[Bridge]
But I'm afraid of not being able to laugh anymore (Oh)
What's life going to become once we don't have anymore heroes?

[Hook]
We don't know what the next man's going through, wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams; we've got to laugh the pain away
We don't know what the next man's going through, wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams; we've got to laugh the pain away

[Interlude]
(Oh) Chris Farley can you hear me?
(Ah) Bernie can you hear me?

[Hook]
We don't know what the next man's going through, I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams
We don't know what the next man's going through, wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams;we've got to laugh the pain away

[Outro]
Phil Hartman can you hear me? (Oh, yes)
Robin can you hear me?
