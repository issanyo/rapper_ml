[Intro]
Get up, get out, go get that money
It’s time to work

[Verse 1]
Up early in the mornin’
I’m ready to go
It smells like struggle
When you open up the door
Everybody gotta grind
Got hustle in my blood
A little bit is not enough

[Chorus]
I go to work
Said hold up wait one minute
I go to work
I get out there and I go get it
I go to work
I don’t leave ‘til I come home with it
I go to work, hey

[Verse 2]
It’s the concrete jungle
So you got to understand can’t judge no body
Gotta get it how you can
Gotta handle your business when the baby gotta eat
Gotta get a real job
Or get it off the street

[Chorus]
I go to work
Said hold up wait one minute
I go to work
I get out there and I go get it
I go to work
I don’t leave ‘til I come home with it
I go to work, hey

[Bridge]
Calling all ladies don’t be shy
Don’t let the moment pass you by
Grab your girls get on the floor
This is what you’ve been waiting for
WORK
There ain’t no problem that music can’t solve
And I work it out, alright
If you wanna have fun when the weekend comes
Let’s work it out
I got to work (let’s work, let’s work)
I got to work (let’s work, let’s work)
I got to work (let’s work, let’s work)
I got to work (let’s work, let’s work)
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
Now let me see you work
Said hold up wait one minute
I go to work
I get out there and I go get it
I go to work
Don’t leave ‘til I come home with it
I go to work, hey, hey
Now let me see yah work
