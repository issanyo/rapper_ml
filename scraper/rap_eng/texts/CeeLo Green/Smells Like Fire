Instantly
Right in front of your eyes
The rhythm gets inside of me
And I come alive
And it makes my body hot
’m turned up all the way
Can’t you hear it talking
And sometimes all you can say
Is ohhh, ohhh
I'm staring through ya
I’m watching it happen to you
Ohhh, ohhh

Our rhythm is gonna get you
I’ll be right there right with you

I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire, babe
And I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire, babe
Ooh

Ooh I told ya baby
If you were wondering how
Now you’re starting to steam
Do you believe me now?
And don’t it make your body hot
Your sexy is starting to burn
Everybody’s waiting
Baby now it’s your turn
Say ohh ohh
Feels so nice and cozy
'Cause now your body knows me
I said ohh, ohh
Don’t take your heat from me
Cause it’s cold without your company

I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire, babe
I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire, babe
Ooh

Everybody’s alright, ooh, baby
Baby don’t you show shame at all
My back’s up against the wall
And we’re grinding
Till it smells like fire babe
And it’s gonna burn forever
Just as long as we’re together
We’ll be grinding
'Till it smells like fire babe

I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire babe
I said you
And me
We
Are starting to smell like fire
