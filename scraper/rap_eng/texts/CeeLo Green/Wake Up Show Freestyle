In the beginning there was none
Other than the original people, skin blackened from the sun
But somewhere along the line I broke the laws of the divine
And a curse was placed on this soul of mine
Pale became the color of my face
Feeling out of place amongst the people of my race
Filled with hate, I moved to a colder climate
Intercourse with animals and raw flesh was ate
Filth and disease, sub-zero degrees
With Satan's blood in my veins, didn't freeze
This hatred that I have for you, it runs deeper than your skin
I hate the one who put me in this position that I'm in
Until I realize the powers of evil
Anything I have to do I will
I steal, kill and destroy, went home to Africa looking for slaves to employ
Blue eyes, lies and a smile was my only decoy
Snatched you up from your roots
What good is a spear when I have this new invention that shoots?
Brought you here then deceived you
I changed and rearranged everything that you have ever believed true
My soul is cold as ice is, I sold you for prices
You were hung from trees for sacrifices
But through the blood, sweat, tears and pain
God's spirit in y'all still remain
Which is actually more than I got, but I have a mansion and a yacht
The project's making you think that it's about what it's not
With precision, I tell you lies through television
Distort your religion, wrap you up in materialism
How could you kill your own?
Don't you see, you're learning to act just like me
But be more aware that the truth is there
I tell you all the time but you niggas don't dare
But not all of you
There are a few that get into themselves and books on shelves
And learn something new
And once they know, they become so powerful
But many don't have the means nor the inspiration to go
To school, and I know they hate it
But you can't get a decent job unless you're properly educated
But educated about what?
It seems to me that thus far, you've only learned about who we are
Isn't that funny, you'll give a school all your money
For what you think you need but it's never guaranteed
The misled mislead you
Your faith has been broken, provoking you to do whatever will feed you
Well I'll front you some cooked cocaine, in plain plastic sacks
To sell to your fellow Blacks
And while the foundation of your people cracks, you try to resist
But I won't stop until you niggas don't exist
You niggas strong though, I'll give you that
But you must be stupid as hell to be that strong and still be where you at
And you still don't have a clue
I am who I am because of niggas like you
