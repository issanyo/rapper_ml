[Hook]
There’s no light in this room
It’s alright we got you
You shine like GOOOLLLDDD
Your walk by
Cause a scene
All the guys they agree
You shine like GOOOLLLDDD
Like GOOOLLLDDD

[Verse 1]
Everybody got a favorite girl
Beautifullest thing in this world
And I want to get in ya
And I want to get in ya
Your goals your dreams
Your life your interests
You shine like gold to me
Love take a hold of me

[Pre-Hook]
You are everything I ever wanted be my lady
So I had to take this opportunity to say

[Hook 2]
Just like my favorite song
Every time you play I sing along
Baby my number one girl is you

[Hook]

Fantasies of a mountain trail
I’m a knight, you’re a nightingale
Can’t you tell
By the way that I talk to you
By the way that I look at you
We a merry-go-round, our love go round and round
She’s my scream machine, our love go up and down

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook 2]
