Beginning (Sampled):
You took away the sound, the touch, the smell, my sight, to see your smile

[Verse 1: Don Trip]
Please, no pity for a G
Though I've got a son that I barely get to see
I see him for an hour. After that he gotta leave
On top of that, I only get to see him once a week
Yeah, right, lucky me
Well fuck child support and whoever disagrees
I learned a valuable lesson, indeed
But I'm just trying to be the best father I can be
Apparently I'm an unfit father, cause all I know is dope
And all I got is dirty dollars
But I'm selling dope to help my family get farther
Cause no 9 to 5 is gonna prevent us from starving
I'm sorry, Jaylin, I don't get to see you like I want to
But I just wanna let you know I want to
If the court grant me visitation, them I'm going to
But you're to young to understand what we're going through
And your mama's low down
She's just doing everything to hurt me right now
Why? Cause I don't love her like I used to
So to get back at me, she knows she's gotta use you
And I don't know what else to do. She don't understand that this shit will bruise you too
And now I gotta take the bitch to court, so either way, it's a lose - lose

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
I writing a letter to my baby
I writing a letter to my son
Tell 'em things done got to crazy
But it's not over, it's not done
I told your mama I don't love her
And made her trip and now she gone
So I'mma be the better one
I'mma be the better one
But I just wanna see my son...

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
I tried talking to the bitch, but she keeps using you as a bargaining chip
And I am not the one to be bargaining with
That just makes me wanna go and put my paws on that bitch
I swear this shit ain't even right, bruh
I ain't even got a chance to change your fucking diaper
This is what I get for going raw when I piped her
Thinking that I loved her, when I shouldn't have even like her
But I do not regret my child
Stupid bitch, I just wanna see my child
Do what you may, but you will never make me bow
Fuck child support, bitch take me to trial
Why you with this shit? Cause I ain't read you no vows?
Bitch move on. Me and you ain't working out
So... what's it matter that if I moved to work out
'Long as I provide, and put food in his mouth

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
I writing a letter to my baby

But it's not over, it's not done
I told your mama I don't love her
And made her trip now she gone
So I'mma be the better one
I'mma be the better one
But I just wanna see my son...

[Verse 3: Don Trip]
'Mater fact, I'm in school right now
'case the music don't work and I can put the work down
My momma say this shit sure to work out
All the bullshit I'm going through to see my first child
See his first steps, see his first Smile
Hear his first Words, teach him how to count
But I guess I've been counted out, seeing as the bitch don't want me around
When I speak to him, he don't recognize the sound
The sound of my voice, so he just looks around
I know she enjoys it, so I suck it up and smile
But fuck the stupid bitch. I just wanna see my child
