(Intro)
Yeah
Romeo Hodges...
Ima tell you this story so you better listen
Yeah
Allot of people take things for grante these days
So you gotta loook in the mirror and just say
What am I grateful for
Everyday is a thanksgiving
In my mind
Cause Im thankful for everything
Im just wondering if you are
Yeah true story...

(Romeo's 1# Verse)
Daddy told her no
But she said yes
So she creeped out the window and
Said
Im a find him and if I dont I'll shoot myself to death
U see
Shawty met a boy online
He said he was everything she wanted and more
But little did she now
He was playin with her
Like a toy
Told her to come ova at 4
For a goodtime
That she would never forget
So she asked her pops
And her pops said no
I never even met this dude before
But shawty was desparate to find the truth
Because her past was so messed up
She was tired being lied too
So she went ova to apartment 208
To see if he was there
Or if it was all a mistake..

(CHROUS 1#)
I am a fool, such a fool...
Such a fool...
For you....

(Romeo's 2# Verse)
So
She knocked on the door
And a 30 year old man answered
And said who are you?
And she said is jjoinnie home
Stutterin...
And he said I am jonnie nice to meet ya
Grabbed her by the hand
And said I can't wait until you see what Im a do to ya
Took her in his room
And said you were the easiest chick
To fool...
Little did he know that
Later on he would be on the news...

(CHROUS 2#)
YEAHHHHHH! YEAHHHHH!
YEAHH! YEAHH!

Ooooo chill!
Ooooooooooooooo!
Ima fool! I'm a fool! Sucha fool!
Like a fool! I'm a fool! ayeeee ayeee!
Ooo baby! AHohhhh!AHohhhh!
Ayee lawd! baby!

(Romeo 3# Verse)
Jonnie soon touched her
Over and over and more
And she said I never even felt this feeling before
And he sad I promise he won't hurt cha..
I really do just love ya
But it was all talk
And
It was her first time
She didn't know what to do
She was so scared
She said how could I get into this
Jonnie said shut up and let me finsih
Let me finsih this...

(CHROUS 3#)
I'm a fool! Such a fool
Such a fool, such a fool
Im a fool..

(Romeo 4# Verse)
And when he was done
He threw her out the door
And said forget chu I dont even need you no more
And ever since that night
She would never trust another man again...
Thats why its to get in her heart again...
Yeah
I would tell you the rest of the story
But I guess I can do that
So I guess this is the end..
