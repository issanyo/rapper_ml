C'mon

Now that I've seen it all
Going through withdrawl
I need something to hurt me again

Oh, happiness was no fun
I'd rather be miserable with everyone
And I need something to hurt me again

And then it whispers in my ear
What do you want from me?
In exchange for some of your company
And all the demons sing

Where can I find it from?
Some more memories to give me some
Cause I need something to hurt me again

And I could use your help
Ah, cause I hurt myself
I need something to hurt me again

And then it whispers in my ear
What do you want from me?
I just want some nice, sweet company
And all the demons sing

And all the demons sing
Help me!
