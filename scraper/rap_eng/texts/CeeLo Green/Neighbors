[Pre-Chorus]
Now, my neighbor likes where I stay
But doesn't know, the price that I pay

[Chorus]
My neighbor, my neighbor
My neighbor wants what he sees
My neighbor, my neighbor
My neighbor thinks he wants to be me
But he'll never be

[Verse 1]
From out my window, seems just fine
But in his mind, he's standing where the sun don't shine
So, I invited him over
Could this make a new friend?
But once I got to know ya, wish I never let you in

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, my neighbor likes my clothes
But hadn't seen me with my scars exposed

[Chorus]
My neighbor, my neighbor
My neighbor
Oh, dissatisfied
My neighbor
My neighbor's behavior is unjustified
I'm sick and tired

[Verse 2]
I don't know, if he lives all alone
But if you're scared of the darkness, best leave the lights on
I had a talk with my neighbor
Say it simple and plain
I guess he understood me
He never came back again

[Pre-Chorus]
Now my neighbor, likes my car
But no matter where you go, there you are...
