Yeah, better believe that slick
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha yeah
I Thought you said you was the G-O-D
Sound like another nigga to me, ha ha, yeah
I thought you said you was the G-O-D
Sound like another nigga to me, shit
What a nigga do, what a nigga does
And a nigga is what a nigga was
And a nigga done read history but yet his eyes didn't see
The only reason you a nigga is because somebody else wants you to be
Well a nigga uneducated, intergrated, singin' "We shall overcome"
A nigga trying to be white is what a nigga seem like have become
And when they call me a nigga to my face'
Can't do nothin' but walk away
But here it is niggers call other niggers niggers each and every day
Dividing and conquering
When they say the lighter shade of black is okay
After the middle class and they passin' by
The project laughing at where we stay
Since a nigga had got grown, had a little bitty of nigga of my own
Should've known I couldn't show 'em no better what I was showin'
Shit, I could've hit the club as fresh as I could be
Really, all for another nigga to see
You know how a nigga get when he see another nigga outfit
Don't want nobody to have what he ain't got
Somebody get drunk, get mad, and get shot
That why the property value ain't no good in a nigga neihborhood
A nigga could overstand if he only understood
I'm sick of lyin' I'm sick of glorifyin' dyin'
I'm sick of not trying, shit I'm sick of being a nigga
Destiny sent me to this dread and she said she felt led
To offer me some wisdom from this notebook she read
And it said that right then the black man's downfall
Was not know that we were not ever niggers at all, hmm
And she looked deeply into my eyes and said brother don't you know
You complain about being black
When they mad coz they can't be black no mo'
So many black men out here trying to be niggers
Keeping it real to the point that they dying to be niggers
When in actuality the fact is you ain't a nigga because you black
You a nigga cause of how you act
But, you don't want me to tell you the truth, so I'mma lie to you
Make it sound fly to you huh, huh
You don't wanna hear the truth, so I'mma lie to you
Make it sound fly to you, shit
