[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well you can be my
Said you can be my
Yeah, you can be my
Yeah, okay, well you can be my
Baby you can be my
Baby you can be my

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Okay, well you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
You can be my...
Yeah, well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Said you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Said you could be my...

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Well, you ain't in the mood to argue
Baby don't you worry, this some shit to get along to
Some shit I right my wrongs to
Well, I've tried to call you, have us a discussion
We never talk, we always way too busy fuckin'
I'll think of something to say, I always do
I'm in love with the way that you say my name
Every time it sound brand new

[Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Baby you could be my... (woo!)
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, I feel like you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Only if you be my...
It's alright, it's okay

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay, and time will tell
If I'm alive and well, cause when I'm by myself
I find that I keep flying high, sometimes I must remind myself
That change is more than pennies laying on the floor inside the well
You cross my mind, do not apologize for being fine as hell
I'm spinning here inside your spell, my mind has start to wander
I missed a day, I stay up late admiring your posture

[Pre-Hook: Mac Miller]
And you, always wonderin' what we'll be
I say we sound better than you or me

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Baby you could be my...
Yeah, well okay, it's alright, it's okay
And baby you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
And I can be your...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Yeah, only if you be my...

[Bridge: Cee-Lo Green]
There's no more you or me, we are we, yes we are
Yes we are sweet babe
And I can see, I can see, so much better
I can see
And carefully, precious things fall apart
Just let them be, let it be, forever
Oh, loving me, in spite of me
Bless your heart, bless your heart
I can breathe, I can breathe so much better, yeah
I won't let anything tear us apart, no, no, no
We are we, we are we, forever

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Okay, well you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
You can be my...
Yeah, well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Said you can be my...
Well okay, it's alright, it's okay
Said you could be my...

[Outro: Cee-Lo Green]
You gotta deal with Mac Miller, bitch
