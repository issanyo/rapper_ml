I’m tired (tired)
So tired (so tired)
Of chasing the dreams (of chasing the dreams)
With tears in my eyes
I realize
That it’s running away

It’s running away

But with all the wrong I’ve done
How could love ever love me?
(??)
But it's not much to say
Not much to say

So please, please, please, help me
Is there some kind of sign?
Please, please, please, please, please
I want, need, somebody, somebody
I want someone to be mine
Please, please, please, please, please

The man
The man in the mirror
Oh, he won’t even look at me
Well, you may not believe it, but my own reflection
Told me I ought to be ashamed of myself
(Told me I should be ashamed of)
Oh, yes it did (myself)
I’ve wasted my time (my time)
My mind (my mind)
My energy
Even let my body down
On the bed
Oh yeah
But I, I, I can't seem to win for losing
Cuz don't nobody love me yet
