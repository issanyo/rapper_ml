I know I'm stingy with my money and it's hard to get some from me
But you still love me anyway, your mother seems to like me
But your father wants to fight me
But you still love me anyway

And I take you out on dates and I always show up late
But you still love me anyway, there's no one else like this
That would put up with my shit
And still love me anyway

Because no matter what I do, I know I can count on you
'Cause baby you still love me anyway
For worse or for better, you make me better
I know you still love me anyway

Because no matter what I do, I know I can count on you
'Cause baby you still love me anyway
For worse or for better, you make me better
I know you still love me anyway

I only see you every now and then and I'm on the road again
But you still love me anyway and when this relationship's not working
That's when all your friends start flirting
And my eyes may wander but that is not okay

So I make it up to you, with a brand new pair of shoes
If you still love me anyway
And I will surely miss the way you put up with my shit
I'll make it up to you some day

Because no matter what I do, I know I can count on you
'Cause baby you still love me anyway
For worse or for better, you make me better
I know you still love me anyway

You still love me anyway, you still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway, you still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway, you still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway

I said mmm, mmm, no one loves me
Quite like you do girl, it's unconditional, unconditional

Because no matter what I do, I know I can count on you
'Cause baby you still love me anyway
For worse or for better, you make me better
I know you still love me anyway

You still love me anyway, you still love me any, still love me any
Still love me anyway, you still love me any, still love me any, still love me anyway
