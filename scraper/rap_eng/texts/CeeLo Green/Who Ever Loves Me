[Verse 1]
If some strangers all opened up and invited me
I can't promise that I won't
And she may be someone you can only see in the dark
You may care, but I don't

[Chorus]
See I'm a simple man
And you don't have to understand
I love whoever loves me
Said I love whoever loves me

[Verse 2]
She could be purple with pink polka dots
But if she loved me, truly loved me, why not?

[Chorus]
