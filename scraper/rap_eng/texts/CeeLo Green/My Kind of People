My name is sugar sweat sweet as a candy shop
Yes I got every car each of 'em candy dropped
Now gather round y'all here comes a sight to see
Me and Menta are comin' kill 'em consecutively
I walk through the door I don't even look at the line
Smokin pine standin under the exit sign
Shawty greets me with a grin, then she starts to grind
We're havin big fun 'til the sun starts to shine

[Hook 2]
