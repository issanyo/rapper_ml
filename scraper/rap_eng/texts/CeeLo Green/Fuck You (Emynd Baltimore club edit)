I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love
And I'm like "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough
I'm like "Fuck you!
And fuck her too"

I said: "If I was richer
I'd still be with you"
Ha, now ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)

And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

Yeah, I'm sorry I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an X-box and I'm more Atari
Mmm, but the way you play your game ain't fair

I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
(Oh, shit she's a gold digger)
Well (Just thought you should know, nigga)

Ooohooohooo
I've got some news for you
Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love
And I'm like "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough
I'm like "Fuck you!
And fuck her too"

I said: "If I was richer
I'd still be with you"
Ha, now ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)

And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

Now I know that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep you trying to please you
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap

Now I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
(Oh, shit she's a gold digger)
Well (Just thought you should know, nigga)

Ooohooohooo
I've got some news for you
Oooh, I really hate your ass right now

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love
And I'm like "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough
I'm like "Fuck you!
And fuck her too"

I said: "If I was richer
I'd still be with you"
Ha, now ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)

And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you!"
(Oooh, oooh, oooh)

Now baby, baby, baby
Why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)

I tried to tell my mama but she told me:
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes, she did

(Oh!) Why? (Oh!), why?
(Oh!) Why? (Oh!), why, lady?

Oho, I love you (Oh!)

Oh!
