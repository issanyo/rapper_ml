[Chorus]
I'm on the line
I'm on the line
Once I clean my mirror, I'm a be feeling fine
Trying to get there, is all that's on my mind
When I'm on the line

[Verse 1]
Now, even though I run my race
With a smile on my face
It ain't easy
No, it ain't easy
Feel like the life of the party
But it's all in your mind
On the line

[Chorus]
I'm on the line
I'm on the line
Once I clean my mirror, I'm a be feeling fine
Even when you're falling, just pretend you're flying
When you're on the line

[Verse 2]
I'm with everybody, but I'm still alone
Just look down, that's my line you're standing on
Let's keep it friendly; we'll be just fine
But don't cross that line
No, no, no, no
