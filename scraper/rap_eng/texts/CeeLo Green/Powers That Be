[Chorus]
It's a lie, nobody's free
We're bound by the powers that be

[Verse 1]
Yeah you got a job that you hate
It's functionin' on a fixed rate
Workin' 24 hours a day only to get nowhere fast
And all the ass kissers are passing you by

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah we're all doing time on planet Earth
All the way up until that day they put you in the dirt
But just because your money can buy you some time
Does not mean that you do not have to die

[Outro]
Why?
For now say goodbye
