Well, here I am
Take me
Look in my eyes
You'll see the soul
Underneath my celebrity skin
I'm not afraid
To open up wider
Please be my guest and come on in
You'll feel right at home
Inside my song
Shelter from the stormy weather
Body and soul, body and soul
Blood will bring it all together
I'm going to lift it up
And lift it off
Higher
Don't depend on luck
I'm driven by what I desire
I'm going to live it up
And lift it off
Higher
Don't depend on luck
Be driven by what you desire
