Come on, I just do it uh, I do it uh
I do it to you good and tight
[Verse 1]
I was sitting all alone yeah
A lot on my mind
I Felt a tap on my shoulder
And I rolled my eyes
I wasn't in the mood for another man
Telling me lies
Then how can a girl say no when you flash that sexy smile
And you say

[Pre-Chorus]
Aha aye aye
Wanna see you get nasty
Wanna see you shake it down babe (yeah)
Hey hey

[Chorus]
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (Boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type

[Verse 2]
In the middle of the floor now
And I just don't care
Take my body so low now
The crowd stops and stares
Let 'em say what they want but I'm feelin' it
And it's for you, baby
Tell me how can a girl say no when you calling out to me
And you say

[Pre-Chorus]
Aha aye aye (ayeeee)
Wanna see you get nasty
Wanna see you shake it down babe (yeah)
Hey hey

[Chorus]
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (Boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type

[Bridge]
What's your fantasy? (Ooh nasty nasty)
Tell them all to me (Ooh nasty nasty)
Don't you be afraid (Ooh nasty nasty)
Share your nasty secrets baby hey yeah yeah oooh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Aha aye aye (ayeeee)
Wanna see you get nasty
Wanna see you shake it down babe (yeah)
Hey hey

[End-Chorus]
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But boy, you just so nasty (Heeey)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (Boy, you just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
But, baby, I don't mind
I love the way you're talking nasty
But boy, you just so (dance this)
