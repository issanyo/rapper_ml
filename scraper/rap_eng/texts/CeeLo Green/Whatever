[Verse 1]
I don't have any friends at all
'Cause I have nothin' in common with y'all
So who's gonna catch me, if I fall?
My back's always against the wall
I don't have anything to say
I want everything to go my way
Shut up mom, it is not okay
I'm alone almost every day

[Chorus]
But it's cool (it's cool)
It could be better (could be better)
I don't care (I don't care)
Whatever (whatever)
Hold up, my man

(x3)
La la la la lah-lah-lah
(Whatever)​
La la la la lah-lah-lah

[Verse 2]
Talk to my counselor about how I feel
Everyone agrees I could use some help
I love my girl more than I love myself
But she's going steady with someone else
I don't know what else to do
Said, fuck me? Well, fuck you, too!
I know it sounds real sad but true
Being alone is nothing new

[Chorus]
But it's cool (it's cool)
It could be better (could be better)
I don't care (I don't care)
Whatever (whatever)
Whatever bitch!

(x3)
La la la la lah-lah-lah
(Whatever)​
La la la la lah-lah-lah
