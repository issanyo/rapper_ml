I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you!" (Ooo, ooo, oooo)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget her, too!"

I said, "If I was richer, I'd still be with ya."
Ha, now ain't that some shhh? (Ain't that some shhh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a... "Forget you!" (Ooo, ooo, oooo)

Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

I pity the fool that falls in love with you (Oh shhh she's a gold digger)
Well (Just thought you should know)
Oooooooooooh I've got some news for you
Yeah go run and tell your little boyfriend

I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you!" (Ooo, ooo, oooo)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget her, too!"

I said, "If I was richer, I'd still be with ya."
Ha, now ain't that some shhh? (Ain't that some shhh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a... "Forget you!" (Ooo, ooo, oooo)

Now I know, that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap

Now, I pity the fool that falls in love with you (Oh shhh she's a gold digger)
Well (Just thought you should know)
Oooooooooooh I've got some news for you
Ooh, I really hate your ass right now

I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you!" (Ooo, ooo, oooo)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget her, too!"

I said, "If I was richer, I'd still be with ya."
Ha, now ain't that some shhh? (Ain't that some shhh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a... "Forget you!" (Ooo, ooo, oooo)

Now baby, baby, baby, why'd you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my mamma but she told me, "This is one for your dad."
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes, she did

(Uh!) Whhhhy?
(Uh!) Whhhhy?
(Uh!) Whhhhy lady?
(Oh!) I love you
(Oh!) I still love you. Oooh!

I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love
