[Verse 1]
All I want is your understanding
As in the small act of affection
"Why is this my life?"
Is almost everybody's question

[Chorus]
And I've tried
Everything but suicide
But it's crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
I prefer peace
Wouldn't have to have one worldly possession
But, essentially, I'm an animal
So, just what do I do with all the aggression?

[Chorus]
Well, I've tried
Everything but suicide
But it's crossed my mind

[Verse 3]
Life is a one-way street, and if you could paint it
I'd draw myself going in the right direction
So, I go all the way, like I really, really know
But the truth is, I'm only guessin'

[Chorus]
And I've tried
Everything but suicide
Oh, but it's crossed my mind
Just a thought

[Verse 4]
It's even dark in the daytime
It's not just good, it's Great Depression
When I was lost, I even found myself
Looking in the gun's direction

[Chorus]
And so, I've tried
Everything but suicide
But yes, it's crossed my mind
But I'm fine
