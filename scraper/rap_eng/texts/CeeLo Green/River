It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer, singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river that I could skate away on

But it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
And then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
Oh, I wish I had a river that I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river that I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

She tried hard to help me, you know, she put me at ease
And she loved me so naughty, she made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river that I could skate away on

Well, I'm so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby that I ever had
Oh, I wish I had a river that I could skate away on

Oh, I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river that I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer, singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river that I could skate away on
Yes, away on...
