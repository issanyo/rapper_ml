Because in a way, God is everything, yaknowhatI'msayin? He he he workin
Through them crackers to save us, in a sense, knowhatI'msayin? The evil
That they do. I mean he made the devil, you understand whatI'msayin?
So the evil that they do it it, I mean knowhatI'msayin, it's only
Supposed to bring something outta us in a way, ya understand, so is it
Bad, understand whatI'msayin? Is it bad that they are the way they are
Because it it it's helping us it's it's opening our eyes to some things
YaknowhatI'msayin?
