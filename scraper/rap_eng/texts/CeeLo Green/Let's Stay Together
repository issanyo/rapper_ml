[Verse 1]
I have already seen my future
And it looks exactly like you
And being in love is sure enough a battle
But I am determined to fight on through
Now some people might consider me a star or somethin'
But shit, they need to shine the light on you
If loving you is wrong
I'm sorry but right won't do, I wanna

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Live, live, live, live together
Baby we can make it, but we got to chase it
We got to live, live, live, live forever
Didn't you know we can live forever, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know you see me over here in the darkness
Talk please, stop pretending that you heartless
Okay, okay, okay, alright, okay you win, babe
Could you find a way to forgive me again, babe?
Get on my knees right here on the dance floor for ya
I'll tap dance for tips at the front door for ya
All I'm tryin' to say is forward from this day I wanna live

[Hook: Pharrell]
Live, live, live, live together
Baby we can make it, but we got to chase it
We got to live, live, live, live forever
Didn't you know we can live forever, yeah

[Bridge]
You hear me woman?
What, you don't think I'll make a fool out of myself in this club this evening, girl?
You gotta know that, gotta know
You gotta know, gotta know
That I love you, baby

[Hook: Pharrell/Cee-Lo]
Live, live, live, live together (that's why)
Baby we can make it, but we got to chase it (that's why)
We got to live, live, live, live forever
Didn't you know we can live forever, yeah
