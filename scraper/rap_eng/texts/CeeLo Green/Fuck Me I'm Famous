[Intro]
Ah√°
You know what?
I am so sick of being modest

[Verse 1]
Hey, pretty lady, you looking good tonight
I really like what you have on
I had no idea that you even existed, uh
I wish I had known
Oh hey, you own the town with a couple of girlfriends
And you wanna have some fun
Ah, well if you decide to get down tonight
Don't you fuck just anyone

[Chorus]
Ah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous
Ah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous
Ah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous
Yeah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous

[Verse 2]
Well, I know that I was creeping up way too real
And I didn't mean to blow your mind
But I was thinking to myself
"Why the fuck does this bad ass bitch have to wait in the line?"
Oh, yeah, I want somebody but my girl got a girlfriend
Huh, let it be known
A word of advice, don't worry about no one on the side
Cause she don't worry about the side you on

[Chorus]
Ah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous
Ah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous
Ah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous
Ah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous

[Interlude]
You know what I was thinking to myself the other day?
I said, "Self
For the life of me I can't figure out how these no-name motherfuckers be having these raggidy-ass bitches"
It's really amazing to me
I be like "Hey now, do they be paying or something?
They ain't got shit else to do?"
Well look here baby, you mights not make no dollars with me
But it sho' make a whole lot more sense

[Bridge]
Oh what's up?
Come on, come on
Don't miss the love train baby
Everybody ready to go
I beg I'll give your away your first class seat
That moving them feet too slow
And we go have us a good time
And baby there's no doubt
Why don't you turn the TV on [?] watching [?]?
What the fuck you still thinking about?

[Chorus]
Ah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous
Ah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous
Ah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous
Ah, fuck me, 'cause I'm famous
