[Hook]
He's bad, he's Cee-Lo Green
But you can just call him the soul machine
(repeat 4x)

[Cee-Lo]
Now I came here for you to love
It's computer love
I make them cut through the rug when I do the club
I can take some mental electric sex
Refuting love
But Gunplay will be graphic if I do the thug
The day to day experience
Is the data that I download
And then remaster onto a rapture
Abracadabra before and after
Over and over
Losing account of all the dreams that I sold ya
But then I gave ya
At the speed of light trying to save ya
Then I go and now come back a row
Whoa
And oh I'm technic to God in a fashion but you can just call me Lo Go

[Bridge]
Whenever you want some soul
Start him up
Whenever you need some soul
Start him up
See he's been given the power
To take you wherever you want to go
Start him up
And tell him what you want

[Bridge 2]
Once you start up the soul machine
You will see what I mean
Open your eyes and enjoy the dream
He can do anything

[All]
He's bad!
