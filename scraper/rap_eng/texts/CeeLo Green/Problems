[Verse 1: Ludacris]
They say Luda would you rather have the money or the fame
I say they try to tell em that it all just depends
Cause everytime I make a lil more money
I seem to be losing more of my friends
So I'd give it all up to repeat life over
And they'd say dude is a fool
I can't trust another motherfucker living in this world
And this really got me losing my cool
What would you'd do if you were in my situation
And the minute everyone you ever loved to say you looked up
You drink your pain to the bottom of a bottle
And the Conjure would have you fucked up
So I'm looking for love in all the wrong places
Pop pills, drink liquor by the cases
Get high, make a woman get low
In the strip club looking for familiar faces
People know me on a first name basis
But all they ever really want is my cash
Let me borrow just a couple hundred dollars
And you know that I'm a pay you back, my ass
This world so superficial
This world done lost my trust
They say Ludacris you've changing
But I really don't give a fuck
What the hell am I suppose to think?
What the hell am I suppose to do?
I'm hearing that the devil's in disguise
And I'm hearing that the nigga look just like you
They know I walk throw the valley of the shadow of death
I don't go astray
And I get down on my knees and pray and I say

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green and Ludacris]
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
I wish my problems would go away, away, away

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Doc said I need to change my diet, cause I'm really not eating right
Mama said I need some peace and quiet, cause I'm really not sleeping right
What's the use of having all the money
And the power in the world, if I can't abuse it?
Seems like the only thing that's keeping me together, is my music
If it wasn't for that, I think I would lose it
If it wasn't for that, I would go crazy
When nobody went good on they word
In the industry they make you feel like, "Fuck you, pay me!"
Cause I gotta feed family, some of the same ones that abandoned me
That still looking for a hand out
Til you found out there ain't shit ya handed me
Hah, still mad at me? But I'm trying to be the man I plan to be
But can't do it if you calling me for dumb shit
Thinking I'm innocent, I'm a plea insanity
Too many distractions and it feels like everyday
So I get down on my knees and pray and I say

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green and Ludacris]
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
I wish my problems would go away, away, away

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I finally made it to the top of the CEO position
But when things don't go their way, these artists got all these suspicions
So the weed keep me at peace, and I think I need an intervention
Who the fuck put me in charge of making all of these decisions
My position got me stressing, like it never did before
Not to mention my best friend drowned and death was knocking at his door
And it seems like someone in my family is passing away like every day
So I just look up to the sky and get down on my knees and pray and I say

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green and Ludacris]
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
I wish my problems would go away, away, away
