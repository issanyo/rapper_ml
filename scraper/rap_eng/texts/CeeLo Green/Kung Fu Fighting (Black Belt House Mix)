'Cause everybody
Is Kung Fu Fighting
Your mind becomes fast
As lightning
Although the future
Is a little bit frightening
It's the book of your life
That you're writing

You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way
Now what would it take to break
I believe that you can bend
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

'Cause everybody
Is Kung Fu Fighting
Your mind becomes fast
As lightning
Although the future
Is a little bit frightening
It's the book of your life
That you're writing

You are a natural
Why is it so hard to see
Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know
But sometimes you've got to go
Go on and be your own hero

'Cause everybody
Is Kung Fu Fighting
Your mind becomes fast
As lightning
Although the future
Is a little bit frightening
It's the book of your life
That you're writing

You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way
Now what would it take to break
I believe that you can bend
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

'Cause everybody
Is Kung Fu Fighting
Your mind becomes fast
As lightning
Although the future
Is a little bit frightening
It's the book of your life
That you're writing
