[Cee-Lo Green]
Another dust I discovered (Look what I've discovered)
A book without a cover (Ah, little black book)
I take to my favorite chair, by the fire..
The art of storytelling (I'm involved now)
Characters so compelling (I think I love her)
The words of a woman's willing mission:
To make my reality stranger than fiction

She's a novel, a mystery book
Looks like I found a future in her history book
So beautiful, that I'm blinded by the light..
(Blinded by the light..)
She's a sweet (sweet), sweet love story
Written especially for me
And I like to thank you for, all the adventure
And that excitement in my life
Al-riiiiiiiiight...

It's you I'm chasing after (sha-la-la-la-la-da-da)
From chapter to chapter (la-la-la-la-laaa-laaaaaah)
You led me to it (from inside me..)
Just got me through it (got me...)
I dream about you in my sleep
The hardest secret that I had to keep
Did she write me so that someone imagine this woman?

[Repeat 2X]
I wish you were here and I wish I was there
I wish that you, were here and, I wish I was there
The more I realize I could see her
I'm a believer, ahhhhhh...

[Cee-Lo sings over the second time]
She's a novel... a mystery book...
I like to thank you for, all the adventure
And that excitement in my life
Al-riiiiiiiiight...alright
Ooh alriiiiight baby
Aliright, you make everything alriiiiight...
Oooooh Lord, alright...
Everything alright {*fades*}
