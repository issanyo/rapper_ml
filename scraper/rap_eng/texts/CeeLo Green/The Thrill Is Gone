[Verse 1]
Something's going on and I'm not saying you're to blame
I know I'm not your girl, I know you're not my man
But something's wrong, I can't explain
After the waste of time, love, let's keep it plain, don't wanna play
'Cause boy, I'm grown and ya damn near twice my age
So tell me what's happening
So let me know just why I'm feeling strange
Just let me know, boy, if your feelings changed
Because I feel the way I feel and I won't let it go until
You let me know 'cause it ain't feeling the same

[Chorus]
It's gone
Along with games, the cars, the lies, the thrill is gone
Woah, gone
Though it was fun but now we're done, the thrill is gone

[Verse 2]
Was is it just a chase? You're acting like you need some space
Perhaps it was the fact, you want what you can't have
And I won't let you get your way
Why do you pick me up just to cast me away?
The love I gave, never quite enough
You really got me stuck, I need for you to set it straight
So let me know just why I'm feeling strange
Just let me know, boy, if your feelings changed
Because I feel the way I feel and I won't let it go until
You let me know 'cause it ain't feeling the same

[Chorus]
Oh, it's gone
Along with games, the cars, the lies, the thrill is gone
Woah, gone
It was fun but now we're done, the thrill is gone, gone, oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, listen up, a cocktail keeps me company
While the piano man plays one for me
Some similar situation must have sent you
'Cause this is too cool to be coincidental
And, oh yes, let's not forget
You look like been dipped in hot chocolate
And I means lots of it
So instead of stay we did the opposite
At a red light but I didn't stop for shit
It's cool, I don't kiss and tell
Oh lover, you don't listen well
It's pleasure, pain's not in my planning
Damn, I thought we had a understanding

[Chorus]
Oh, it's gone
Along with games, the cars, the lies, the thrill is gone
Woah, gone
It was fun but now we're done, the thrill is gone
The thrill is gone, woah
