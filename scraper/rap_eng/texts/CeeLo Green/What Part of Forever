Run run run away so lost lost never comin'
Home rollin' rollin' down a track
No no I'm never comin' back
Love pumpin' in my veins
Our love I hope it's not too late
That's the road that's the load that's the role
I've been down I've been down I've been down

(What part of forever)
(Don't you understand)

I could stay stay stay, if that's what you want want want
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
And we could go go go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart

Run run run away so lost lost never comin'
Home rollin' rollin' down a track
No no I'm never comin' back
Love pumpin' pumpin' in my veins
Our love I hope it's not too late
That's the road that's the load that's the role
I've been down I've been down I've been down down

(What part of forever)
(Don't you understand)

I could stay stay stay, if that's what you want want want
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
And we could go go go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart

Imagine eternity, it doesn't seem that hard
They say nothing lasts forever
We'll have to prove them wrong

I could stay stay stay, if that's what you want want want
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
And we could go go go
And never look back on now
I'd give it to you you you
If I had a heart heart heart
