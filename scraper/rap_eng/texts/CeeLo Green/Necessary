[Verse 1]
If I could have your heart, I'd show I love ya
I'd love you more than I could love myself
Mountain high, or the valley low
You have no idea just how far I'd go, Hey yea
I'll go put on my good clothes and I'd sing and dance
I'd take the time and I'd take the chance
I'll make you laugh, I'll make you cry
I'm a tell ya like this if you ask me, why?

[Chorus]
It's all because I love ya, I do
It got to be necessary, to you
Hope your eyes are wide open, you'll see
That your love is necessary, to me
It's all because I love ya, I do
It got to be necessary, to you
Hope your eyes are wide open, you'll see
That your love is necessary, to me

[Verse 2]
When I sing, you know, what I do?
I close my eyes and I think of you
When I wake up, I'd like to see
How much more you've become proud of me?
I get excited, my eyes tear
It gives me purpose for bein' here
I'd walk the desert and I'd swim the sea
As long as when I get there
You're in love with me

[Chorus]
It's all because I love ya, I do
It got to be necessary, to you
Hope your eyes are wide open, you'll see
That your love is necessary, to me
It's all because I love ya, I do
I got to be necessary, to you
Hope your eyes are wide open, you'll see
That your love is necessary, to me

[Bridge]
You see, life is so very, very short
Your love is keepin' me alive
Say that you love me (say that you love me)
I pray that you love me (pray that you love me)
'Cause I know if I
Could just hear you say it
I could make it through the rest of the day
Say that you love me
I pray that you love me

[Chorus]
It's all because I love ya, I do
It got to be necessary, to you
Hope your eyes are wide open, you'll see
That your love is necessary, to me
It's all because I love ya, I do
It got to be necessary, to you
Hope your eyes are wide open, you'll see
That your love is necessary, to me

[Outro]
This be the truth, ever spoke
I feel naked singin' every note
In my heart, happy
Quick take down this note
This be the truth, ever wrote
