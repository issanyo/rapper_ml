You so freaky
You so freaky shorty
Ooh, you so freaky
Shit, you so freaky shorty

Uh uh, you so freaky
Ooh Lord, you so freaky
Mmm uh, you so freaky shorty

Now everybody that's grown got skeleton bones
They got hidden away
Yes y'all there's a freak in us all
Yet some choose not to say

You can't let those who ain't yet
Make you they lil' ball of clay
Be free and express yourself
Nastiness comes naturally
Listen to me now

It could be the way I wanna freak a song
Tattoos, or the way I dress
Or it could be, I wanna walk my way
And refusin' to follow the rest

Or when people haven't been where you been
And they say you still going too far
Or when you wit ya girl and
Pull over and fuck somethin' in the back of the car

I'm a freak
(I'm so excited, go on and say it)
A closet freak
(Oh, I'm a freak, yes I'm a freak, and just can't fight it)
A freak
(I'm so excited, go on and say it)
Aww, a freak
(If you a freak, say you a freak, don't try to fight it)

You got to let the music freak your mind
All the way, if yo' brain leavin' don't mind
You know a boyfriend thing is hard to find
Get on the floor mama and bump and grind

Ain't nuttin' wrong wit, you only gon' get
But it ain't no fun if you been freakin' all mornin'
I'll turn you on to it if you want you gon' do it
All you got to do is find somebody like you

A freak
(I'm so excited, go on and say it)
A closet freak
(Oh, I'm a freak, yes I'm a freak, and just can't hide it)
A freak
(I'm so excited, go on and say it)
Aww, a freak
(If you a freak, say you a freak)
(Wait a minute, where the god-damn horns?)

Freak, sometimes I like freakin in the mornin'
Freak, sometimes I like freakin at night
Freak, some people like freakin just lightly
Freak, some people think freakin ain't right

Freak, some people like freakin outside now
Freak, some people like freakin in the club
Freak, some people like freakin on the express-way
Freak, some people keen doin' it in public

Freak, some people like freakin with the lights out
Freak, some people hell just don't care
Freak, some people like freakin 'bout money
Freak, some people freak anywhere

Freak, you a freak?
Freak, are you a freak?
Freak, I'm a freak
Freak, big ol' freak
