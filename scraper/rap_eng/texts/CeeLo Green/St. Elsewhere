[Verse 1]
I packed a few of my belongings
Left the life that I was living
Just some memories of it
Mostly, the ones I can't forget
Whenever you need me, I'll be here
Until then, my dear
I'm goin', I'm going, going there
Don't ask me to make time
To travel back and forth
Let nature take its course
Maybe I'm open from all this ocean air

[Chorus]
And if it weren't for you
I'd be without a care
Setting sail to St. Elsewhere

(Oh hum hum, oh hum hum)

[Verse 2]
Anywhere you sit, you can see the sun
Unfortunately, on this island, I'm the only one
Same rules apply on a rainy day
And it's not such a pretty place to be
It just rains, and rains, and rains, on me
Send a simple sign I can understand
Then, a flower grew out that sand
Before you know it, I was back out on that sea

[Chorus]
Now, I don't mind it so much
Because as long as I'm not there
Anywhere, St. Elsewhere (yeah)

(Oh hum hum, oh hum hum)

[Verse 3]
Way over yonder, there's a new frontier
Would it be so hard for you to come and visit me here?
I understand
Well, just send me a message in a bottle, then, baby

(Oh hum hum, oh hum hum)

(Oh hum hum)

St. Elsewhere
