[1st Verse]
When I ask, "What you wanna do?"
Then I say, "I'm coming through"
{"I like it!"} Ah-do you like it?
{"I like it!"} Ah-do you like it, baby?
When I take you to the mall
And tell you, "You can have it all"
{"I like it!"} Ah-do you like that?
{"I like it!"} Ah-do you like it, baby?
I don't care how much it cost

When I get you in the bed
To back up everything I said
{"I like it!"} Ah-do you like that?
{"I like it!"} I know you like it, baby

[Chorus]
Eve-ry-thing you do.. Baby, it's workin~!
{"I like it!"} I like it!

When you had a hard day
And I say, "Baby, you gon' be okay"
{"I like it!"} I know you like that
{"I like it!"} I betcha like that
Can I come over and cook somethin' to eat
Let's sit down and I'll rub your feet
{"I like it!"} Ah-would you like that?
{"I like it!"} I know you like that
We can sit here and talk some mo'
Or watch yo' favorite TV show
{"I like it!"} Ah-would you like that?

I'll run yo' bath, get you ready for bed
And back up everything I said
{"I like it!"} I know you like that
{"I like it!"} I know you like it, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Rap Verse]
A-check me out
A-wassup, young ladies? My name is Lo
I got a brand new game you never played befo'
I might not be slim, might not be trim
But don't'chu worry 'bout a thing, girl don't mention to him
Ah-let me hold ya close, whisper in ya ear
And tell you all the things that you wanna hear
Ah-let me touch ya there and make you feel alright
And then I'll rock ya body 'til the early light
But there's just one thing that you got to do
Ah-be good to me, and I'll be good to you
Ah-can you handle that? Ah-baby let me know
Ah-either love me right, or let me go
'Cause I'm the ONE~! You betta ask somebody!
ALL the pretty ladies 'round here wanna party
Yeah, baby girl that might be true
But I don't want none of them, baby I want you

[Chorus 2X]
[Outro - repeat 'tl fade]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-laaah
{I like it!} ... {I like it!} ...
