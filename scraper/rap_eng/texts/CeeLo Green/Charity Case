[Refrain]
Ooh, ah (repeat throughout)
Give, give, give it away, now
Give, give, give it away, now
Give it away, now

[Verse 1]
I-I-I-I don't know what matters to you, at this moment
But that's all that matters to me
How are you? (How are you?)
Knock on wood
Well, I'm not doin so good
(I bet you probably couldn't tell)
(Although you're worth it, I'm still not well)
And I don't understand how I'm so understanding
I guess that that's all I can be
How are you? (How are you?)
I think I can help
But I can't help myself
(Shouldn't I be happy? You need my help)
(I usually just talk to myself)

[Chorus]
Oh, can't you see, oh, can't you see?
If I help somebody, baby there's mercy for me (me)
Ah, charity (And you, for you)
(One, for you, and you, and you)

[Bridge]
Don't wanna bother you, baby, but I'm bleedin', too
Are you needin' me like I'm needin' you?
Even my shadow leaves me all alone at night
Guess I need to start to take my own advice
(La la la la lah, la la la-lahhhh)
(La la la la lah, la la la-lahhhh)

[Chorus]
Oh, can't you see, oh, can't you see?
Somebody's a liar, whoever said freedom was free (free)
Ah, charity

[Refrain]
Ooh, ah (repeat throughout)
Give, give, give it away, now
Give, give, give it away, now
Give it away, now
Give it away, now
Woo!
Alright
Yeah
I want to be your baby
Charity
You better give it to somebody
