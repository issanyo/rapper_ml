For a lifetime of service in the name of love
I wanna thank you
I could say it a thousand time and it wouldn't be enough
I wanna thank you for everything you do
I wrote a song about ya
What would we do without ya
And we won’t forget
And all our lives have been blessed cause you're simply the best
And we thank you

I admire your quest for fire
The one that always burns inside
After all you've been through
You still continue
In memory of the ones who fought and died

So we’re thanking you-ooh
Living a dream come true
Alright, well
Ooh-ooh, have I got news for you
Yeah, you are appreciated

For a lifetime of service in the name of love
We wanna thank you
I could say it a thousand time and it wouldn't be enough
We wanna thank you for everything you do
I wrote a song about ya
What would we do without ya
And we won't forget
And all our lives have been blessed cause you're simply the best
And we thank you

Now please know that you're my hero
And each and every day is new
When I see ya
I wanna be ya
If only I was brave as you

So I'm thanking you-ooh
For everything you do
Uh-huh, yes
Ooh-ooh, I know this much is true
Dude, my mama was a firefighter

For a lifetime of service in the name of love
We wanna thank you
I could say it a thousand time and it wouldn't be enough
We wanna thank you for everything you do
I wrote a song about ya
What would we do without ya
And we won't forget
And all our lives have been blessed cause you’re simply the best
And we thank you

Now ever since I was a little kid this was a dream that I had
(so bad, so bad, so bad)
And every now and then I wanna ride that fire engine so bad
Yes, I do!

For a lifetime of service in the name of love
We wanna thank you
I could say it a thousand time and it wouldn’t be enough
We wanna thank you for everything you do
I wrote a song about ya
What would we do without ya
And we won't forget
And all our lives have been blessed cause you’re simply the best
And we thank you
