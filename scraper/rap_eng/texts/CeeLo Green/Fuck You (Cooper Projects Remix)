[Hook]
I see you driving around town
With the girl I love and I'm like: "fuck you!"
Ooh, ooh, oooh
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough; I'm like: "fuck you!"
And fuck her too!
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit?
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best with a: fuck you!
Ooh, ooh, oooh

[Joell Ortiz]:
Word, damn Evette
You ridin' round town in that man's Corvette
We went half on my welfare check
I'm sick I ain't even get my health care yet
That's it
F you and your stank ass
Hope your weave fall out and the train crash
On the way to get your hair did
And your nails chip and your feet hurt cause your heel rip
And when you go home complainin' he beat yo' ass
Mess up your teeth so bad
That you can only eat your mash, potatoes
Anyway, your food so bad, the neighbors
Probably throw your steak out
Yeah, I was lyin' about never being hungry
I spent money on that take out
I find a better woman any day
Kiss my ass
Your breath smell like shit anyway

[Verse 2]
Now I know that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap

[Bridge]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit, she's a gold digger)
Well.. (just thought you should know nigga)
I've got some news for you
("...ooh, I really hate yo ass right now.")

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
I tried to tell my momma but she told me
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Why? Uh! Why? Uh!
Why lady? Oh I love you
Oh, I still love you, ooh
