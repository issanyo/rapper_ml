[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day, baby
While I hide from the sun
It's better if you don't understand
Cause you won't know what it's like until you try

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Verse 2: Cee-Lo Green]
We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted, but baby, what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you, try

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Verse 3: B.o.B.]
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
Cause this ain't Wonderland, it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line, you can't change your mind
Yeah, I'm a monster, but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly, I've been feelin' insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was, you would run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
Cross over the line, and come back alive
But that's the price we pay when we living on the other side

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

[Outro: B.o.B]
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
