Pump up the peculiar
While I yell unique
If you see what you want
If you're wondering what it look like, look at me

Hey, aah, aah
Let me show you how to do it
Hey, aah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm well on my way
I'm almost everything
And this is my day
Oh, make me want to sing

I'm free, look at me
Behold everything I'm allowed to see
Free, come and see
Na, na, na, na, na na na

Shapeless, formless, heart is enormous
Bore this, I've worn this
No never what the norm is
Come hear this, it's fearless
Contrast and color
Prisms so warmin'
Listen and love it

I'm free, look at me
Freedom in hi-fidelity
Free, come and see
Na, na, na, na, na na na

Ah, what you waitin' on?
I want action, passion, smilin', laughin'
Yieldin', feelin', helpin', healin'
Introduce your neighbor to your saviour

I'm free, look at me
Freedom in hi-fidelity
Free
Na, na, na, na, na na na
