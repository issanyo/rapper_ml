I believe in magic
Once upon a time
When something had to be special
Couldn't see it online
Was that my business plan?
Well, you lost your biggest fan
Tell me, what's the point in doing
What anybody can?
Now all the rock stars are regular people
And being alive is becoming a bore
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing, is shocking anymore
Now that reality is a TV show, I wish you liked me a little more
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing, is shocking anymore
I can't believe it's over
The glory days are gone
I can't hear my heartbeat
With the radio on
Now he's in love with him
And she's the M&M
Well hey, I wish you well
'Cause everything's for sell
Now all the rocks stars are regular people
And being alive is becoming a bore
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing ,is shocking anymore
Now reality is a TV show I've seen a million times before
'Cause nothing absolutely nothing is shocking anymore
(Instrumental break)
Now all the rocks stars are regular people
And being in love is becoming a bore
'Cause nothing absolutely nothing is shocking anymore
Ain't nothing at all better than a j-o-b, but tell me who you're working for
'Cause nothing, absolutely nothing, is shocking anymore
