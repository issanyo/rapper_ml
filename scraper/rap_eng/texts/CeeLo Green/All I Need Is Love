[Intro]
[Kermit the Frog]
Ladies and gentlemen
May I introduce to you
Who?

[Miss Piggy]
Ceeeeee-Lo!

[Kermit the Frog]
Green! (laughs)

[Cee-Lo Green]
What's up guys, how you doin'?

[Kermit the Frog]
What do you want for Christmas, Cee-Lo?

[Cee-Lo Green]
For Christmas?

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green (The Muppets)]
All I need is love
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Aw, yeah
(Do-do-do-do)
All I need is love, yeah
(Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
All I need is la-la-love!

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo Green]
Color-coordinated Bentleys
Watches, car, the agent sent me
A sixty inch in every room
But all I wanna see is you
Got the cash to take vacations
To a beach in every nation
I don't wanna be a Scrooge
But I'm not going without you!

[Bridge]
Santa don't know what to get me
I just wanna see my baby!

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green (The Muppets)] (2x)
All I need is love
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Aw, yeah

[Animal:]
A little love!

(Do-do-do-do)

[Animal:]
A little love!

All I need is love, yeah
(Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
All I need is la-la-love!

[Verse 2]
[Cee-Lo Green]
Diamonds on my mistletoe

[Kermit the Frog]
But that can't buy you love, you know

[Cee-Lo Green]
Yeah, I'd give it all away

[Gonzo]
For just the chance to see your face

[Cee-Lo Green]
I'd take a jet or hop a train

[Fozzie Bear]
Or maybe Rudolph knows the way?
I don't know

[Cee-Lo Green]
To where you are this Christmas Eve

[Miss Piggy]
'Cause just one kiss is all I need!

[Bridge: Cee-Lo Green]
Santa, won't you come and get me
And take me where I'll find my baby?

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse 3: Pepe the King Prawn]
Come on Mr. Santa, if you could
Steamed, baked, or or fried, I'm always good!
I only stole one little heart this year
But it was from a shrimp, who really cares?
It's time to make his list and check it twice
So I hope he likes his seafood naughty and spiced
You got something bad to say about this crustacean?
You'd better clam up 'til after Christmas vacation!

[Bridge: Cee-Lo Green (Miss Piggy)]
Santa, won't you come and get me
(I'm ready for my presents!)
And take me where I'll find my baby?

[Chorus] (3x)

All I need is la-la-love!

[Outro: Statler & Waldorf]
[Statler]
I think the Muppets hit a new low!

[Waldorf]
Yeah, and his first name is Cee!

[Both]
Do-ho-ho-ho-ho!
