[Intro: The Pussycat Dolls]
Ahh...ahh
Ooh, baby
Dolls

[Verse 1: The Pussycat Dolls  & (CeeLo Green)]
I know you like me (I know you like me)
I know you do (I know you do)
That's why whenever I come around, she's all over you
And I know you want it (I know you want it)
It's easy to see (It's easy to see)
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be uhh with me

[Hook: The Pussycat Dolls]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha, don't cha?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha, don't cha?

[Verse 2: The Pussycat Dolls & (CeeLo Green)]
Fight the feeling (fight the feeling)
Leave it alone (leave it alone)
'Cause if it ain't love
It just ain't enough to leave a happy home (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Let's keep it friendly (let's keep it friendly)
You have to play fair (you have to play fair, yeahh)
See, I don't care
But I know, she ain't gon' wanna share

[Hook: The Pussycat Dolls]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me? (oh)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me? (like me)
Don't cha, don't cha, baby
Don't cha, alright, sing
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me? (raw)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me? (big thrills)
Don't cha, ahhh, don't cha

[Bridge: The Pussycat Dolls]
I know I'm on your mind
I know we'd have a good time
I'm your friend, I'm fun and I'm fine
I ain't lyin'
Look at me (shh), you ain't blind
I know I'm on your mind
I know we'd have a good time
I'm your friend, I'm fun and I'm fine
I ain't lyin'
Look at me (shh), you ain't blind

[Verse 3: The Pussycat Dolls + (CeeLo Green)]
See, I know she loves you (I know she loves ya)
I understand (I understand)
I probably be just as crazy about you if you were my own man
Maybe next lifetime (maybe next lifetime)
Possibly (possibly)
Until then, old friend, your secret is safe with me (shh)

[Hook: The Pussycat Dolls]
