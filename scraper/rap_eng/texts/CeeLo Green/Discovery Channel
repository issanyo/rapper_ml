[Verse 1]
Well I walked to the ends of the Earth
In the burnin' hot Sun and the freezin' cold
And I found her
Yes I did
I'm talkin' 'bout a beast of a woman that'll moan so strong
Hiccup would draw a crowd around

[Chorus]
Hey look what I discovered
She lives, she lives
Why would I ever be selfish about her?
I'd share her with the world
It's a crime to be selfish about her
Man is not her maker, she's a mystery
She is precious, not a pet and she is wild and free
And she'll never bite the hand that feeds her
And she knows her way home

[Verse 2]
One shot then she howled at the moon
Then I leaned in and licked her wound
And kissed it
Then I sang her a song
How could something so strong, be so submissive?

[Chorus]
Hey look what I discovered
She lives, she lives
Why would I ever be selfish about her?
I'd share her with the world
It's a crime to be selfish about her
Oh look at the magic that your mother's done
Bless us all and give birth to another one
I'll make sure you have shelter
And this will always be home
