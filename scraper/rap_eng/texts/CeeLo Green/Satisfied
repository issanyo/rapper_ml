[Cee-Lo Green]
Baby - where's the road taking us?
And baby - that's why they call it making love
Darling I will do my best
I'm fallin at the feet of your highness
No need to ask; the answer is always yes

[Hook: repeat 2X]
The least I can do is try
I, want, you, to, be, a, satisfied
Oh let me satisfy you

[Cee-Lo Green]
Baby (baby) baby just ah wait and see
And maybe (maybe) it just takes a little faith in me
Friend of mine, follow my lead
I want to make sure that I succeed
A little encouragement is all I'll need

[Hook]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Oooooh, I want to satisfy youuuu, youuuu, youuuu
I want to satisfy youuuu, youuuu, youuuu
I want to satisfy youuuu, youuuu, youuuu
Oooooooooooooooh

[Hook] - 2X

[Cee-Lo over second repeat]
I've got to satisfy you!
I want to satisfy you baby
Ooooh girl
Please, please, let em satisfy you ma
