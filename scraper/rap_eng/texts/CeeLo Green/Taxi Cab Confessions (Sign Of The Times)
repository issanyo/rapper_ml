[Intro]
I wonder

[Chorus]
Could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
In the darkness it shines like a sign of the times

[Verse 1]
When I feel like I'm all out of love, and my time is up
It scares me, judge us fairly
If only music could make us understand
I swear sometimes I hear a ghost in the radio
I went from station to station lookin' for somewhere safe to go
I'm not the only one seen it
So I know I'm not crazy
'Cause I can't move 'til it makes me
Please try to save as many as you can

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well it's something you can't deny
Go 'head and ask me why
For the meaning
And if you think you're dreaming
Oh I've got the perfect song for you
If I time it just right, I won't have to say it again
Will my 2 cents be enough for you to play it again?
I put some weight on it
You see, repetition can change the human condition
Oh listen if it's the last thing that you do

[Chorus]
