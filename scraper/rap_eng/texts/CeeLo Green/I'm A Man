Well, I'm all flesh and bone
Hmm, I'm a man
Cool and calm, big and strong
Hmm, I'm a man
There's so many ladies that need love
Oh, I'll do the best I can
But if the morning comes and I'm not there
Then darling please understand that
I'm a man
I'm a man, that's right I am
I'm a man
Well, feels so dirty but stays so clear
'Cause I'm the man
Yes, I am

Built to last, like a love machine
But I'm a man
I said, good or bad, right or wrong
Oh, take me as I am
But when you need somebody to scratch back at you
You'll need these helping hands
Uh, I'm a man
Uh, I'm a man
Touch my hand
Touch me
I love you baby, but God knows
Let's do that baby!!
I'm a man
Yes, I am
