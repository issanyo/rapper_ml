[Intro]
Sorry Jay, but I love her too
What am I supposed to do?
I love her!

[Verse 1]
Jay Z is the king
And I'm prolly his biggest fan
There's a feelin' inside that I'm sure he'd understand
That I'm in love with Bey and I wanna be her man

[Pre-Chorus]
He wears his hat down over his eyes
And he's smoochin' her with those lips, I just know it
And he's drivin' her around in his Maybach late at night

[Chorus]
Don't you know I want Jay Z's girl?
I wish I had Jay Z's girl
Tell me, where can I find a woman like that?

[Verse 2]
He's got all the cash
All I got is a pocket full of ones
But I'm watchin' the game, soakin' it up like a sponge
Yeah she's cute, but it just won't be the same with Solange

[Pre-Chorus]
He wears his hat down over his eyes
And he's smoochin' her with those lips, I just know it
And he's drivin' her around in his Maybach late at night

[Chorus]
Don't you know I want Jay Z's girl?
I wish I had Jay Z's girl
Tell me, where can I find a woman like that?
I want Jay Z's girl
I wish I had Jay Z's girl
Tell me, where can I find a woman
Where can I find a woman like that?

[Bridge]
It's just a dream in the middle of the night
I know that will never be
But I need a queen in my life
And it starts with the letter B
Tell me, where can I find a woman like that?

[Chorus]
Don't you know I want Jay Z's girl?
I wish I had Jay Z's girl
I wish I had Jay Z's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Jay Z's girl
I wish I had Jay Z's girl
I wish I had Jay Z's girl
