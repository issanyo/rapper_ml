[Verse 1]
I remember stealing the peppermints out my momma's purse
She used to say, "there was a war on little black boys and it's only getting worse"
While everybody screaming and shouting, I got my best leave in church
Cause I don't wanna going on and know it all if the truth gon' hurt

[Chorus]
Then my grandma said, "boy, wake up
I think that he's talking to you"
She said, "wake up
God may have something for you to do"
Don't make me sad and make God mad
He's only gon' choose a few
You better wake up
Cause you're wearing your Sunday shoes

[Verse 2]
Then my grandma felt the spirit and she stood up slow
Then she just looked at me and smiled, and let my hand go
Then she already known she gotta go to God alone and she couldn't make me
And I only prayer when she was up there, as that a lifetime it wouldn't take me

[Chorus]
I don't wake up
I think somebody's talking to you
You better wake up
There may be something for you to do
Don't you make me sad and make God mad
He's only gon' choose a few
You better wake up
And tighten up your Sunday shoes

[Bridge]
Well, keep walking with Him
Cause God is the real love
Had for them owning so long
Don't be surprised how you could still fit up
Thank your momma, thank your daddy
Look at and you have it
My beloved grandma Ruby
Sunday morning and shining right through it

[Chorus]
Man, wake up
I think somebody's talking to you
You better wake up
There will be something for you to do
Don't you make me sad and make God mad
Cause he's only gon' choose a few
You better wake up
Cause you're wearing your Sunday shoes

[Outro]
Well, well, well
