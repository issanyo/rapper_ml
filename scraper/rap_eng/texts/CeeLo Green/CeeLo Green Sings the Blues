[Intro]
La La La La
Ooooooo

[Verse 1]
Hello My name Is CeeLo Green and I’ve go the blues
Cause don’t nobody love me no more
Maybe just alittle bit more than you did yesterday
But not like you loved my before

[Chorus]
See I’m tired, so tired
But I can’t please everybody
But I try
I try

[Verse 2]
My name is CeeLo Green and I got the blues
Don’t nobody appreciate me
My heart is filled with unconditional love
How could anyone hate me?

[Chorus]
See I’m tired, so tired
Maybe the world will be better off without me
But I try
I’ll try

[Verse 3]
My name is CeeLo Green and I’ve got the blues
I don’t know what else to do
The only reason I’m alive right now
I’m living for the love of you

[Chorus]
But I’m tired so tired
God bless my soul
Cause I try
I try
