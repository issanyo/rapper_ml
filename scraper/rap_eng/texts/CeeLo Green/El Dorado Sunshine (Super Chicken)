(chorus x8) Super Chicken

(Verse 1)
Listen now, I got a story to tell
About a bird who wanted to fly away
You see he knew that he could and he probably would
But his family said they needed him to stay
But his spirit is strong and he's been waiting so long
And he don't really want nobody to tell him daddy wrong
So excuse me I wanna go and kiss the sky
Cause these wings that I was given were inteded to fly

(chorus x8)

(Verse 2)
Everybody mad at lil' ol' me
Cause I ain't the same bird I used to be
Oh but if you had a dream, something you wanted to do
I sure wouldn't be the one to keep it from you

(singing)
I can't let nobody hold me down
This is my life and that's my sky
I was born to fly

(chorus x8)

(Verse 3)
Look it here
This is nothing I should fear
This should down and disappear
I done lost my fear
I don't know if you seen what I saw
But I hope someday you'll see it my way
I believe
I believe
I can breath
I believe I can find some happiness
I know that ya watch me grow but don't worry 'bout me
Cause I'm gonna be ok
I wanna sing, wanna dance, wanna scream, wanna shout
I wanna be everything I am
I ain't nobody's fool
Nobody's child no more
I'm a full grown man
I used to wonder if I could
If I would
If I should and I know I got to know
And now three ain't no doubt in my mind
I can do it, I can do it, I know I can

(chorus x8)

(singing)
If I couldn't fly
I might well die
Let me go human, can't go hold my hand no more
Let me go
Let me be, set me free
Let me go

(chorus x8)
