[Verse 1]
You are just as beautiful as the day we met
Baby
Seems like a million years ago, you haven't changed yet
It's amazing
Why do you keep loving me the way you do?
Tell me
And I watch you give your all, stumble and fall
But never fail me

[Chorus]
Ooh you're making me wonder about you
Wonderin' how my life'd be without you
Such a nightmare
You're making me wonder about you
Wonderin' how my life'd be without you

[Verse 2]
You're an angel by my bed, watching over me
When I'm sleepin'
And you're the voice of reason that keeps on echoin' in my head
When I'm cheatin'
Said why do you keep on loving me, the way you do?
Tell it
I watch you give your all, stumble and fall
But you never fail me

[Chorus] x2
