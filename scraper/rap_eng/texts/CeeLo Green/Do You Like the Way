[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Watch the master plan, the pastures span
Through the streets, flipped the beat
Move the sheep like the Shepherd
It's a new day, my crew stay
Forever striving
Give thanks 'cause we alive and
Been through the gutter
Now we see the Horizon
It's clear to me now
Used to be confused (I can see clearly now)
Took a lot of years to see how
Now, we movin' planets
Take the average mind and expand it
You take for granted like we're
Always gonna be disadvantaged
But soon come, it soon come
Ya soon done
Ya start run, you stumble
We catch one
In the rhythm, Santana lick the
Guits with precision
Not accidental, intentional
Concious decision
To Zion, we're marching
Through with African Mayans
Conquering Babylon with
The heart of a lion
Behold to watch yesterday
Come back around
And the walls of Jericho
Come a tumbling down
(Selah)

[Verse 2: Cee-Lo Green]
Tell me how long has it been
Is everything, everything
Alright my friend
You see, time is passing
People asking how come none
Of this ain't lasting
Money will, make people deal
Like they don't even have to feel
But no, it ain't real, it ain't real

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Oh, Do you like it the way
That it's going down
Do you like it the way
That it's going down
Ooh, Do you like it the way

[Verse 3: Cee-Lo Green]
How long, how long will we wait
To sit down and communicate
See, everything is relative, if
You want to get, then give
Can't we all just build and live
Can't we, can't we?

Oh, Do you like it the way
Do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
