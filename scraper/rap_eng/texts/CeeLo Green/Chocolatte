[Intro]
Tonight we're gonna do something a little different

[Verse 1]
I said don't even look at me if you love her
I am one sexy mothafucker
Once you have me you won't want another
Sailors on the ship hollerin' 'bout hubba hubba
Ooh baby, ooh, what you wan' do?
I want teach you somethin' new
When I stand up in the [?] he be like comment t'allez vous
Oh I can speak another language too

[Chorus]
My whole body is chocolatte
Be careful or you'll get some on your face
Oh wanna, wanna, wanna, bang, bang
Here, have a taste

[Verse 2]
I think you should go 'head and keep her
Why? Because she's so much cheaper
But if I ask, and he go get it
There's only one banana, maybe we can split
Ooh baby, ooh, what you wan' do?
I want teach you somethin' new
But it's not only you they wanna oochi coochi too
Every day it's like it's deja vu

[Chorus] x2
