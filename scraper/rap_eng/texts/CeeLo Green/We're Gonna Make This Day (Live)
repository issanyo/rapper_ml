"You got a quarter?"

I passed out last night and I never made it home
Wound up on a bus to San Antone
Now my head hurts bad and I ain't wearing shoes
Gonna find my wallet and my way back home to you

We're gonna make this day (make this day)
A little better than the last (better than the last)
It's amazing how slow a day like this can go
Find a way to wash away (way to wash away)
Any regret you have
Don't let this moment pass, but live inside this day

I got cuffs on my hands, chains on my feet
Got locked up for the second time this week
And I know I make you cry but girl my love is true
Gonna find my wallet and my way back home to you

We're gonna make this day (make this day)
A little better than the last (better than the last)
It's amazing how slow a day like this can pass
Find a way to wash away (way to wash away)
Any regret you have
Don't let this moment pass, but live inside this day

"Hey, baby...
Yeah, I know... I kinda got held up
Yeah, I need you to come get me if you don't mind
Yeah, they got me again
Hello? Hello? HELLO!?
Oh, baby...
It's not my fault!"

Now I'm back on the street, thumb in the air
Don't know how the hell that I got here
But I'm gonna hitch that ride, if it's the last thing I do
Gonna find that wallet and bring it home to you

We're gonna make this day (make this day)
A little better than the last (better than the last)
It's amazing how slow a day like this can pass
Find a way to wash away (way to wash away)
Any regret you have
Don't let this moment pass, but live inside this day

We're gonna make this day (make this day)
A little better than the last (better than the last)
Oh now, don't you let this life come whip your...
Find a way to wash away (way to wash away)
Any regret you have
Don't let this moment pass, but live inside this day

Hit me!
Yeah!
Here it comes, oh, yeah!

Zop-a-do-zit!
