Here's a little story about a Cho Cha cat
She loves me and I love her back
She has my heart, you know how?
I think they're all jealous
When all the ladies say meow

I know that you love me
Why don't you just say it? Meow
Uh, it's written on your face
It's in your eyes, meow

Uh, I like it when you listen
And you let me do the talking, meow
But you tell the most wonderful lies

Cho Cha, darling, you're my only friend
Tell me I won't be alone again
Cho Cha, darling, you're my only friend
Tell me I won't be alone again
You're my best friend

Cho Cha, I love you, meow
I ain't gonna say it
You know what you doing, meow
If you get out of the box
That would be too much, meow

You're so sweet
You were sitting on the sofa
Watching TV, meow
I just wanna eat you up

Cho Cha, darling, you're my only friend
(You're like my best friend)
Tell me I won't be alone again
Cho Cha, darling, you're my only friend
(You know you are)
Tell me I won't be alone again

It's because you'll take me
(Take me)
Take me as I am, come on, take me
(Take me)

I will always be true
It's because you'll take me
Take me as I am, come on, take me
I'll do the same for, for you

And I know I'm hard to deal with
But you're always open to my suggestion
So damn sweet and warm and fuzzy
You drive me crazy, I love you, baby
Cho Cha, I love you, meow

Cho Cha, darling, you're my only friend
Tell me I won't be alone again
Cho Cha, darling, you're my only friend
Tell me I won't be alone again

It's because you'll take me
(Take me)
Take me as I am, come on, take me
(Take me)

I will always be true
Take me
(Take me)

Take me as I am, come on, take me
(Take me)
I always had for you
You're like my best friend, meow
