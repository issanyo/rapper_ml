Well hello, is this thing on?
Is anybody listening?
A brand new day has begun
The first thing that I want do
Make sure that you feel it too
So I'm not the only one

C'mon and lift me up, it's a brand new day
Open up a little happiness today
So I can be someone new (So I can be someone new)
C'mon and lift me up to a better way
Open up a smile on another face
So I can feel something new

Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
(Feel something new)
Open up, open up some happiness
(O! O! oo-yeah..)
Open up, open up some happiness

(Excuse me)
Ahem ahem
Let me clear my throat
So you can hear clearly every word spoke
Today I woke up feeling lovely
Happiness overflowin' knowin' somebody loves me
Just think yesterday I was down and out
Now there's not a single thing for me to frown about
And the same thing can happen to you
Smiling so hard my mouth look like a capital "U"

Yeah, I want the sun to shine
All the time
Is that too much to ask
Ooh, I want to have some fun
I want all my friends to come
'Cause it's now or never
Learn the words and sing together

C'mon and lift me up, it's a brand new day(Yeah)
Open up a little happiness today(Ooh)
So I can be someone new (So I can be someone new)
C'mon and lift me up to a better way(Yeah)
Open up a smile on another face(Ooh)
So I can feel something new

Your heart deserves your trust
A choice made by all of us
The sun will come back tomorrow
There's a message in the bottle(So I can feel something new)
So come on I'll meet you there
There's enough sunshine to share
As long as you know
The bridge between us is a rainbow

C'mon and lift me up, it's a brand new day(Come on-n)
Open up a little happiness today
So I can be someone new (So I can feel something new)
C'mon and lift me up to a better way
Open up a smile on another face
So I can feel something new

Open up, open up, open happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
(Feel something new)
Open up, open up, open happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
Open up, open up, open happiness
Open up, open up some happiness
(Yeah.   Feel something new)
Open up, open up, open happiness
(Ha hah. Yeah happiness)[?]
Open up, open up, open happiness
Open up, open up, open happiness
Open up, open up, open happiness
Open up, open up, open happiness
Open up, open up, open happiness
(Yeah)
