[Verse 1]
Let's take a little trip down Memory Lane, everybody
Let's see if the future could follow me that far
Come just the way you are
Now everybody knows how the story goes, yes you do now
You're starting to get that little tingle down your spine
'Cause you know it's time

[Chorus]
Dance, little children
Dance, little children
Dance, little children

[Verse 2]
Come on everybody, won't you clap your hands together
Have a little fun, let me make you feel alright
Until you're burnin' bright
I said they're gonna be playin' our song forever
No standin' around, sayin' you don't know how
You're s'posed to do it now

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Gon' and smile 'cause you've come a long way, baby
No matter where you're from, it's all about where you're at
You just remember that

[Chorus]
