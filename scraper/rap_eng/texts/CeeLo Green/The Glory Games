For the glory of love
I know exactly what I’d do
I’d fight until the death of me
And be a champion for you
I’d hike the hillside for your heart
I’d swim the seas for your soul
And I promise when I’m done
It will be the greatest love story ever told

I’d run the sands in my bare feet
Oh victory’s so sweet
For your every heartbeat
I will courageously compete
At the sound of the gun
I’ll refuse second to none
I’ll be waving my flag proudly
Once I've won

It’s the glory of love
It’s the glory of your love
The glory of love
The glory of your love

To the finish line
I finally made it
A medal of honor to commemorate it
No split decision could be debated
I hurried where the others hesitated
Let’s go where no crowd will be
So only you can be proud of me
Grab you and I hold you close
You’re the trophy that means the most

Oh baby
It’s you, it’s you
Oh baby
It’s really you

For the glory of love
For the glory of your love
For the glory of love
For the glory of love

Oh glory of love
Glory of your love
Oh glory of love
The glory of your love
