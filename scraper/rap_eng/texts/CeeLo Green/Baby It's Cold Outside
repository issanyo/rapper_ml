I really can't stay
Baby it's cold outside
I've got to go away
Baby it's cold out there
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Why don't you put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Baby it's cold outside

I simply must go
See that it's cold outside
The answer is no
I said it's cold out there
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh, your lips are delicious
Maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

Hey I've got to go home
Baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I'm thrilled when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old lie
Baby, baby it's cold outside
