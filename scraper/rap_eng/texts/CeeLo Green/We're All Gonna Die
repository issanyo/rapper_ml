We're all gonna die
When I was a very young boy, mama told me we all gonna die
Mama said son love can't be trusted, it's just another weakness
We all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We're all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We all gonna die
Now I'm grown, seen a lot livin', made a few friends
Gonna get high, hoping I don't take more than I'm given
Judgment day comin', we all gonna die
If my wings should fail me lord, meet me with another pair
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We're all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We all gonna die
Baby getting born, old man die'n
Young lady laughn', old woman cryin'
Leaving like a lamb, comin' back like a lion
Babylon to Zion, we're all gonna die
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die
When I was a very young boy Mama told me, we're all gonna die
Mama said, "Son, love can't be trusted
It's just another weakness, we're all gonna die"
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die
If my wings should fail me Lord, meet me with another pair
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We're all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We're all gonna die
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie
We all gonna die
