I'm bizarre
Avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive
You're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make believe?

[Chorus]
Anything you want
(I can explain)
I can explain it
Any misunderstandings, baby
(Let me explain)

Why won't you sit and talk to me?
(Let me explain)
Let me explain it
Ahhh ahhh ahhh yeah

I'm supernatural
I am strange
Into whom or to what
Shall I change?

Out of pace (yes of pace)
I am wonderful
Just let me count the ways (let me count the ways)

[Verse 4]
I'm supernatural (ha, supernatural)
