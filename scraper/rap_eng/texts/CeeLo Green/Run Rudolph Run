Out of all the reindeer you know you’re the mastermind
Run, run Rudolph, Randalph’s not too far behind
Run, run Rudolph, Santa’s got to make it to town
Santa, make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a boy child "what have you been longing for?"
"All I want for christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar"
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star

Run, run Rudolph, Santa’s got to make it to town
Santa, make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round

Run, run Rudolph, Santa’s got to make it to town
Santa, make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl child "what would you like most to get?"
"I want a little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a saber jet

Run, run Rudolph, Santa’s got to make it to town
Santa, make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round

Run, run Rudolph, Santa’s got to make it to town
Santa, make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round
Run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round
Run, run Rudolph, wheeling like a merry-go-round
