Whoa-oh
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I love Mary (I love Mary)
Blind Mary, marry me (Marry me)
I love Mary (La la la)

[Verse 1]
She has never seen the sunshine (Sunshine)
Yet, she's getting along just fine (Fine)
She's not staying, she's just passing through (Through-ooh-ooh)
Hey, do you mind if I follow you?
You

[Chorus]
I love Mary (I love Mary)
Blind Mary, marry me (Marry me)
I love Mary (La la la)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I heard a voice say, "Catch me, if you can"
Before you know it, I was holding her hand
It's harder to imagine than understand
How she knows exactly who I am
Yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She's my friend, she doesn't judge me
She has no idea I'm ugly
So, I've absolutely nothing to hide
Because I'm so much prettier inside
Yeah

[Chorus]
