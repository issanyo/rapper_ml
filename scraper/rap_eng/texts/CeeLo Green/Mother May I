[Chorus]
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I

[Verse 1]
Mommy just listen
Something in the wind keeps calling me
And I'm old enough now to answer
I want everything thatâ€™s mine
Give it all to me I need your, your blessing
Cause your baby was born to be out of control
It'll help me make it home safely
But I'm still not sure If I wanna live to be old

[Chorus]
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I

[Verse 2]
Now mommy I know you're watching
I've been a good boy, I'll never bring you shame
I'll never know all your secrets
But it's impossible for us not to be the same
Now I've got one chance
To do whatever it is I'm supposed to do
When you think I'm ready
Please make sure that I come back home with you
Oh

[Chorus]
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
Say I wanna be alive tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I

[Bridge]
One way you can show you really love me
Just to let me go
But make sure that you tell my heavenly father
I said hello

[Chorus]
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
Say I wanna be alive tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I
