[Verse 1]
Who would've known, the wind and the sunshine
Would oh baby, baby, build up these walls of mine
And I can't see you or breathe you
Cause there's trouble right beneath you
It's all in the night
But oh baby, baby, come pick me up in your ride

[Bridge]
I'm a cool old Jane with the skip on my feet
I play tough as nails with my heart on my sleeve
I'm nothing but a sand castle
Baby don't blow me away, away

[Chorus]
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile
Bay-ba-ba-ba baby, don't blow me away
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile
Bay-ba-ba-ba baby, don't blow me away

[Verse 2]
Who would've known, the storm of my past time
Would oh baby, make me, losing the song of the eye
And I can't believe you or read you
Cause there's pleasure in your preview
It's all in your eyes
But oh Mr. DJ, baby, can you meet me outside?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're an old school dude
With the kick on your shoes
You've got groove in your hands
The way you spin those tunes
I'm nothing but a sandcastle
Baby don't blow me away, away

[Chorus]
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile
Bay-ba-ba-ba baby, don't blow me away
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile
Bay-ba-ba-ba baby, don't blow me away

[Bridge]
Ooh, and just like the ocean
Lays right there behind me
Look over my sandcastle
And there's a sight to see
Don't blow me away
Don't blow me, baby

[Chorus]
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile
Bay-ba-ba-ba baby, don't blow me away
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile
Bay-ba-ba-ba baby, please don't blow me away
Away, away
