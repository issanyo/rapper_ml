[Letra de "Crazy"]

[Estrofa 1]
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

[Estribillo 1]
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

[Estrofa 2]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, oh, that's my only advice, oh, oh

[Estribillo 2]
'Cause I think you're crazy
'Cause I think you're crazy
'Cause I think you're crazy
Just like me
Hmm
