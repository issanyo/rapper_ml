[Verse 1: Cee-Lo Green]
I started a war
And I landed on my own sword
Wish I could take back those stupid things I said
How could I be so foolish?
I called out to God
But the devil keeps answering
I’m tryin’ every little remedy I can
But it’s all just bullshit

[Pre-Chorus]
Well everybody says
Time will clean up this mess

[Chorus]
But only you
Only you, Only you can make it better, put me back together
Come on baby, let’s be real
Only you, Only you, Only you could stop the bleeding, give me what I’m needing
Tell me so my heart can heal
Only you

[Verse 2: Lauriana Mae]
I’m dressing my wounds
But the blood it keeps soaking through
Yeah, I cut it just a little bit too deep
And I feel so dizzy
I pick up my phone
And throw it against the wall
And I cry like a baby in my sleep
Without you
With me

[Pre-Chorus: Lauriana Mae]
[Chorus: Lauriana Mae, Cee-Lo Green]

[Verse 3: Lauriana Mae, Cee-Lo Green]
Only you can make me smile in the pouring rain
And you can take the hurt right out of my pain
I know I can try to fill the space inside
With somebody else but there’s no use

[Chorus: Lauriana Mae, Cee-Lo Green]
