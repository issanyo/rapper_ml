[Chorus: Usher]
They tell me that I play a lot
But I don't think that they play enough
I don't know if I'm right or not
Tell me who ever stops growin' up
We're just big kids
The world's our toy
For boys and girls, for girls and boys
Tell me who ever stops growin' up

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, still ridin' big wheels, still addicted to J's
Favorite team on my fitted, in every color they make
I paint the town and every city I stay
ADD or you just never really learn how to play
A livin' breathin' walkin' memory on Memory Lane
Tell me are we really movin' or just dreamin' in place?
What's today? Outer space, still I'm searching somethin' great (somethin' great)
A new museum of broken toys, just tryin' to fill a void
Yeah, I wake up a different year, different peers
Tables turned, I tried not to interfere
Yeah, shiftin' gear, tryna steer, things changed
See them gettin' smaller in my rear view mirror

[Pre-Chorus: B.o.B]
Are you here, are you really here, can you hear me clear?
Biggest fear, hate to say goodbye, hate to disappear
Yeah, tell me are you really here
If it's just imagination, hate to see you disappear

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
They tell me that I play a lot
But I don't think that they play enough
I don't know if I'm right or not
Tell me who ever stops growing up
We're just big kids
The world's our toy
For boys and girls, for girls and boys
Tell me who ever stops growin' up

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, how you expect to mean somethin' to the world
If the world don't mean somethin' to you? Ayy
Focusin' on all the negative
The only thing that's negative is somethin' in you, ayy
We become the people that hurt us the most
That's why the saying is, "Keep your enemies close"
Stop givin' attention to what you don't want in life
Or be prepared to experience it the most
I became everything I used to criticize
Had a look inside the critics' eyes, uh
Yeah, but all roads lead home
We just arrive at a different time

[Pre-Chorus: B.o.B]
Are you here, are you really here, can you hear me clear?
Biggest fear, hate to say goodbye, hate to disappear
Yeah, tell me are you really here
If it's just imagination, hate to see you disappear

[Chorus: Usher, Cee-Lo Green & (B.o.B)]
They tell me that I play a lot (too much, too much)
But I don't think that they play enough (right, right, right)
I don't know if I'm right or not (not, not, not)
Tell me who ever stops growin' up (right, right, right)
We're just big kids
The world's our toy
For boys and girls, for girls and boys
Tell me who ever stops growin' up
Tell me who ever stops growin' up
