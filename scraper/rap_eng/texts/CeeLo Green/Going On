[Verse 1]
I've seen it with my own eyes
How we're getting otherwise, without the luxury of leaving
The touch and feeling of free is intangible, technically
Something you've got to believe in
Connect the cause and effect, one foot in front of the next
This is the start of a journey
And my mind is already gone
And the fear of the unknown
Somehow, just doesn't concern me
And you can stand right there, if you want

[Chorus]
But I'm going on
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
To a place in the sun that's nice and warm
I'm going on
And I'm sure they'll have a place for you, too

[Verse 2]
Anyone that needs what they want
And doesn't want what they need
I want nothing to do with
I aim to do what I want, and to do what I please
Is first off my to-do list
But every once in a while, I think about her smile
One of the few things I do miss
But, baby, I've got to go
Baby, I've got to know
Baby, I've got to prove it
And I'll see you, when you get there

[Chorus]
But, I'm going on
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
May my love lift you up to the place you belong
I'm going on
And I promise I'll be waiting for you
