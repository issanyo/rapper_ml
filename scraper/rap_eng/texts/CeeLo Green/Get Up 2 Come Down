[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Big K.R.I.T.]
Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Back at it one mo' gain'
Cranking my motor, revving my engine
Chilling the AC 'til it's colder than a breeze in Alaska
Sun shine like the winter time just passed us, watching for laws and jackers
Cause this shit here too clean to be taken
I keep it tucked off in my clothes, you'll never catch me out here bucked naked
Fresh drawls, them deadstock Js for the caskets
Pressing up on these bastards that owe me and I gots to have it
Wake up and cake up 'cause it's only right
Soon as the sun go down, the freaks come out and they gon' dress in sum'n tights
I'm tryna dig deep, ginger ale and Hennessy
It keep me in the zone, all night long tilâ€™ the clock strikes twelve
One mo' then I'm out of the front door
On a mission like a Waffle House cook for the 2-4/7
Man, I'm just trying to get paid
And make it where these mothafuckas hate
I got up to come down

[Hook: Sleepy Brown & Big K.R.I.T.]
Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
This for those playas in those gator belts
Getting cheese like patty melts, serving up game like help yo' self
Refereeing, calling plays on the sidelines
Super the bowl, diamonds and gold, won a ring like five times
I remember wanting to be that cause I seen it
Don't ever tell a hoe you love a hoe if you don't mean it
Unless it's bout that paper paper, got that from a playa pimp
They say it's work to be a P-I, easier to be a simp
Put it in motion, rollercoasting
Peep the focus of a go-getter
If you flip it once and get it, it for sure figures
If you ain't eating with you squad, you's a hoe nigga
That's from the heart, never pump Kool-Aid when we on a mission
That's 24/7 like a waffle cook in a Waffle House kitchen
Man, I'm just trying to get paid
And make it where these mothafuckas hate
I got up to come down

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Big K.R.I.T.]
Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

[Verse 3: Cee-Lo Green]
Now here's a little story that must be told
A wild young nigga off on Campbellton Road
I was raised on Kingsridge where there weren't no rules
Robbing niggas for they Starter jackets and shoes
Yeah, I've done some real things, family full of fiends
Forty ounce of Old English and some Newport kings
Went from a pocket full of pieces and '74 Caprices
A Benz and a crib in Buckhead, thank you, Jesus
Boy I'm Sweet James Jones when I'm whipping a Biarritz
A Rollie on my wrist and a super bad bitch
And you know it's southside, you can tell by the color
Give it a good look cause there'll never be another
Hoes, a hundred spokes, what you expect?
And trust me, money can't buy you that respect
Gotta feel it out of love, and get it from out the mud
And it'll come round, or get out the way
I'm coming down

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T. & Sleepy Brown]
Trying to get up to come down
Young playa worldwide, third coast all day
Mississippi well connected everywhere mayne
"4eva N a Day", 4eva howeva, 4eva anyway
You know how it be mayne
When you all the way down in the game underground
Trying to get up to come down
When you come up off that thang mayne
Them people can't stand you mayne
They can't, they can't get with it mayne
Cause they don't realize how or what it took
To get to a place where forever is a mighty long time
And all that time, you was doing it big
Trying to get up to come down
Somebody get fitted
4eva is, 4eva was and 4eva we will be
Multi til' the muthafuckin sun die
K-R-I-T, King Remembered In Time, believe that there
Trying to get up to come down
So as the beat keep rolling on, the slab keep hitting that
808 keep going on and the bassline keep being filthy and slashing
This is forever ever lasting in a timeless fashion, beitch!
