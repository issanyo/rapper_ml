Oh yeah...
Candles burnin' low
Lots of mistle toe
Lots of snow and ice
Eveywhere we go
Choirs singin' carols
Right outside my door

All these things and more
(All these things and more)
That's what Chrstmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

I see your smilin' face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love you madly
It seems I love you more
And little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more, darling)
That's what Chrstmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)

Oh I feel like runnin' wild
As eaches and a little child
Greet you neath the mistle toe
Kiss you once and then some more

And wish you a Merry Christmas, baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby)
And such happiness in the comin' year
(And such happiness in the comin' year)
Oh let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill a sheet with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
We go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more, baby)
That's what Chrismas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
