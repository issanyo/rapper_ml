[Thoughts from MauSe]

Interviewer: Mr. President, in talking about the continuing recession tonight, you have blamed mistakes of the past, and you have blamed the congress. Does any of the blame belong to you?

Ronald Reagan: Yes because for many years, I was a Democrat

Crowd: *laughs*

[Verse 1]
They say illuminati's in the air
That's why the dollar bill has an eye
What if I told you that I didn't care?
Because the pyramid doesn't cry
Which means they don't see the kids grieve
In the inner cities, that they let the outsiders blitzkrieg
But the outsiders get these, warrants to get things all up in the mean streets
Commentary on the brick wall
They made it monetary off a pitfall
Kids see they mom and daddy all piss poor
Pitchforks in they arm, on the floor, rent gone
My mask up, as I tag up
Letting my views breathe life on the canvas
The fast buck put doom on my friends so I pray
But I still see grins everyday

[Hook]
& I can tell you know how hard this life can be...
But you keep on smiling for me
But the 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles
Keep on smiling for me
The 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles

[Verse 2]
Food stamps and welfare
That's what they giving us from Congress
They say you can't be helped here
I swear I think we need a conference
Conquests of areas breed conflict
And conflict makes convicts
Photo shoots for con flicks
It's like a jail contest
Pro's and cons for a congruent conscious
The concept of my spirit is acrylic
I let my art speak and my hear just mimics
Political cynics believe in a little pillage
But to raise one child it takes a small village
Mother on the corner tryna make money
Her slogan is ain't nothing that they can take from me
Things are rough right now, please pray for me
She just smirked as she waved to me

[Hook]
& I can tell you know how hard this life can be...
But you keep on smiling for me
But the 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles
Keep on smiling for me
The 3rd 3y3, never smiles
The 3rd 3ye, 3rd 3y3, never smiles

[Verse 3]
From Staten Island to Astoria
My 3y3's look at the government getting cornier
MauSe, I swear it feels ima foreigner
So many secrets Victoria, isn't sure of the
Signs, they hang in front of our 3y3's without a corridor
They all look at us blind but we are warriors
Can you dig it? They dominating
This is a fruit fight, let's impeach Ronald Reagan

[Hook]

[Outro: Ronald Reagan]
One of my favorite quotations about age, comes from Thomas Jefferson, he said that "We should never judge a president by his age only by his work." And ever since he told me that, I've stopped worrying. Just to show you how youthful I am, I plan to campaign in all 13 states

Crowd: *laughs*
