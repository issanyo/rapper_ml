There once was a hopeless romantic
Who’d give his heart away on a whim
I am no longer him
I’d rather not relive all her reasons
All untimely, yet I understood
My heart is broken for good

Chorus:
Cause you lie
Tell me what happened to forever
Instead of crying, I talk to the chair
You told the world we’d always be together
Now I’m the only one standing here
I’m ashamed and angry at you all because
I believed every word that you told me
But you promised me love
Promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love

I wanna compromise and be optimistic
This is all of a sudden absurd
But you gave me your word
Love is a battle field, who won?
Look at the casualty we’ve become
How could you promise something that can’t be done?

Chorus:
Cause you lie
Tell me what happened to forever
Instead of crying, I talk to the chair
You told the world we’d always be together
Now I’m the only one standing here
I’m ashamed and angry at you all because
I believed every word that you told me
But you promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love

You promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love, love
