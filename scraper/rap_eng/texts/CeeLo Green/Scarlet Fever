Chorus
I'm afraid of Scarlet because
I'm fallin' in love
And I am not ready to die
Scarlet fever is killing me

She's a sophisticated lady
It's that easy to explain
Her name is Scarlet
But I'm not sure about who we are yet

And I find it very hard to fight
I mean this woman seems to do every single thing so right
International woman, she has seen a time or two
Knock knock, who is it? Oh Scarlet how nice of you to visit

She's an interesting character in a movie about me
Me and Scarlet and Scarlet fever, which one should I call it

And things that I have not said she hears
Then she just does something to me and then disappears

Chorus x2
I'm afraid of Scarlet because
I'm fallin' in love
And I am not ready to die
Scarlet fever is killing me

Such a special love
Feels like fire every time I touch her
It's Scarlet fever, and I'm not ashamed to say that I need her
It's the sweetest sickness that I have ever known
I think I love her, I just hope that I don't cry because of her

And I noticed that every time she came
It's amazing how she never ever looks the same
And I know you know, I know you do
Because you are just too good to be true

Chorus x2
I'm afraid of Scarlet because
I'm fallin' in love
And I am not ready to die
Scarlet fever is killing me

Refrain x2
I said I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna go
All I really know is that I just don't know
It's fever, oh lord, it's Scarlet fever
