This is our song
Sing it with me children

Nobody lives forever
So come on let’s have some fun
And I want a happy ending
Just like everyone wants one
And life would be sweeter
If we all had somewhere we could run
Oh don’t you dare tell me what can’t be done

They say you don’t have to grow up
But you’ve got to grow older
It only hurts when I laugh
You see
'Cause I’ll always be young, I’ll always be young
In my mind
But I’m racing against the time

(alright, yea yea yea, na na na, yea yea yea)

Never mind the mirror in your room
Be who you feel
The grounds under your feet
But you won’t get there standing still
Peak and valley is a promise
But don’t you stop until
Oh and I’ll make it, yes I’ll make it, yes I will

Had a fight with my father time
About my mother’s nature
That makes me destiny’s child
Cause see I’ll always be young, I’ll always be young
In my mind
I’m racing against the time

(alright, yea yea yea, na na na, yea yea yea)

I’m racing against the time

(alright, yea yea yea, na na na)

I won’t keep any secrets from you, baby
I’m a sinner (Alright)
And I may have lost your war of words
But hey now I'm still a winer
Does wearing your heart on your sleeve really mean
That it is isn’t in you?
Looking good but you aren't that great of a pretender

When everything is said and done
I'll be alive in my own son
SO I'll be there when his son has one
I'll always be young young in my mind

(alright, yea yea yea, na na na
Alright, yea yea yea, na na na
Alright, yea yea yea, na na na
Alright, yea yea yea, na na na)

Racing against the time
