[Verse 1]
It's cool being the only one, but it's lonely
I could have fallen in love a thousand times before
If only someone had known me
They say there's someone for everyone
Oh, but the work will be never done
When all you need is to be met halfway, but nobody tries
Don't be surprised

[Chorus]
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised

[Verse 2]
There are hills and mountains between us
Always somethin to get over
Needless to say, it's a wonderful day
I just noticed how nice it was to know ya
Oh, but be ready to sacrifice
If you love him, you should tell him twice
Because when everything that's alive ultimately dies
Oh, lord
Don't be surprised

[Chorus]
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised

[Verse 3]
Somebody's watchin'
Maybe you want 'em to see you
But with your regrets and secrets
You don't really want them to be you
Well, you can make believe I'm blind
And, for now, I'll be just fine
But when the child grows up to have more than just your eyes
Don't be surprised

[Chorus]
Don't be surprised
Don't be surprised

[Verse 4]
Now, the ending to every story is most enchanting
Now, whether it's heaven or hell, I wear it well
Please forgive me for rambling
I just wanted y'all to know that I don't know it all
So, when the big ol' smile ends up being just a disguise
Don't be surprised

[Chorus]
Don't be surprised
Oh, Lord
Don't be surprised
Oh, Lord
Don't be surprised

I said don't be, don't be surprised
There's nothing like that in here
Surprise you baby, 'prise you, babe
