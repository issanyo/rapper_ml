[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's still the same, can't you feel the pain?
When the needle hits the vein, ain't nothing like the real thing
I've seen it once before and, oh, it's something else, good God
Cool breeze, come on in
Sunshine, come on down
These are the teardrops of a clown, the circus is comin' to town

[Pre-Chorus]
All I'm sayin' is, sometimes, I'm more scared of myself
You better (Move)
I said, (Move)

[Chorus]
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run children
(Ah!) Run for your life
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run away
(Ah!) Run children
(Ah!) Oh
Here it comes, said run

Alright

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm on the run
See where I'm comin' from?
When you see me comin', run before you see what I'm runnin' from
No time for question askin', time is passin' by, alright
You can't win, child, we've all tried to
You've been lied to, it's already inside you

[Pre-Chorus]
Either you run right now, or you best get ready to die
You better (Move)
I said, (Move)
Ooh

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hurry, little children, run this way
I have got a beast at bay

Promise me when the chance comes (run away)
You'll run as fast as you can (run as fast as you can)
Don't you dare look backwards (don't look back)
Run as fast as you can (run as fast as you can)

(x2)
(Ah!) La la la, la la la
(Ah!) La la la la
(Ah!) La la la, la la la

[Chorus]
