[Hook]
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "fuck you," and fuck her, too
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit?
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a fuck you (oh, ooh, oooh)

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

[Bridge]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit, she's a gold digger)
Well.. (just thought you should know nigga)
I've got some news for you
("...Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend")

[Hook]
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "fuck you," and fuck her, too
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit?
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you [the best]
With a fuck you (oh, ooh, oooh)

[Verse 2]
Now I know that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap

[Bridge]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit, she's a gold digger)
Well (just thought you should know nigga)
I've got some news for you
("...Ooh, I really hate yo' ass right now")

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
I tried to tell my momma but she told me
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Why? Uh! Why? Uh!
Why lady? Oh I love you
Oh, I still love you, ooh

[Hook]
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
