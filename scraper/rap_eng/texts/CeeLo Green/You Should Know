Part 1: You Should Know

[Chorus: Merna]
I'm a, a, a rolling stone (oh, oh)
And, and, and I keep on turning (oh, oh)
But you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)
Ma-ma-maybe you should learn
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Papa just copped a Mustang
Lookin' at you like it must sting
Sweatin' me and mine, I bet a dollar your nuts stank
Hoppin' on the left coast learnin' new west slang
Naturally better, versus them, it's like flint to a cup of rain bars
I'm on par with Rocky and Clubber Lang posse
Know I'm possibly the best they ever seen
Yeah, I'm possibly the best you ever seen
Young Gu yellin' I should rippity rap more
I'm known to black out, y'all resemble the Oscars
Flow so much I need life guards
Not like Rikers, them some whole new bars
Influenced by many but I'm a whole new star, yeah
There's levels to this but I'm a whole new floor
They talkin' keys to success but I'm a whole new door
Still slippin' through traffic screamin' [that the allure?]
I'm breakin' the law, was too much to ever ignore
I been exceedin' the limit since I had an Accord
Always had a need for speed before I met that boy
9th Wonder, I spent the summer bumpin' Wuuuu, nigga (Wuuu, nigga)
Now they like, "Wooo, nigga!" (wooo, nigga)
Been hearin' you for a few, nigga (for a few, nigga)
It's true too many can't fuck with ya
Uh, hope you know the realness in that bar
I know some rappers only nice to me as jesters
Who really just afraid 'cause they know I go that hard
Askin' if so-and-so and I are gon' rap together, yeah
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried about it
There's room in this game, it ain't crowded
Aimin' at the top nowadays, y'all worried 'bout Miley Cyrus
That's a tear in my eye that I ain't cried
It's some paths to a milli homie, you ain't tried
I count ten by fives, I'm always halfway there in my mind
It's on you to catch up this time
'Cause you know

[Chorus: Merna]
I'm a, a, a rolling stone (oh, oh)
And, and, and I keep on turning (oh, oh)
But you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)
Ma-ma-maybe you should learn
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Dropped out of poo-poo weighin' 6-2 with a loose screw
That the doctor couldn't glue, ooh look mama, she said
This world a game, you crack with two commas
When Tutankhamun was Africana, you were a black diamond
Know too many stars turn to comets
We run from the comics until we subjects to the comics
I'm a hero, don't be stressin' the zeroes and the commas
Lookin' anacondas, know they comin' with apples and oranges Satan playin' me, I ain't Adam unless we talkin' 'bout bombin'
Over Baghdad, you look bad tryna to spar with me
I'm a lethal weapon, a saber or a razor, Darth Vader, Al Qaeda
Every friend of Jada, that set it off, I'm a midget at labor
Deliverin' babies the size of raiders, opinions were made
Ultimatums got none so don't come lookin' for favors
I'm tired of you fakers, Carolina, but I still rep the Lakers
Westside, Eastside, every side my tithes good with my neighbors
Double back on my sins and pray one day I'm good with my maker
Tomato, tomato don't apply, you better watch what you say to me
Everythin' ain't okay to me, everybody won't cater me
Though I know I'm a child of destiny, fulfillment is up to me
Up to your neck in debt for every bet you threw up against me
Lord listen, forgive me, I ain't got no sympathy flowers
They say it's better to die with pride than to die as a coward
I say some situations call for our pride to be swallowed
So we live to watch payback come in the form of good karma
'Cause you know

[Chorus: Merna]
I'm a, a, a rolling stone (oh, oh)
And, and, and I keep on turning (oh, oh)
But you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)
Ma-ma-maybe you should learn
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better
You should know better

Part 2: Bustalude

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah
You know I heard what he said right?
Loving you was all I wanna do
My whole life
Rapsody
Please let your brother Busta Rhymes elaborate on this topic a little further
You know the subject of love
Let me get on my Barry White shit real quick

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Royal empress queen, damn, I so adore you
There's so many ways to describe this love I've been holdin' for you
I been lookin' for this forever, been searchin' abroad
For that original woman lovin', the nurture to God
The power of your presence speaks even when bein' silent
Universal alignment, I respect your refinement
The focus to blossom this love is my only assignment
I wanna provide and take care of you until we approachin' timing
And when you talk, your words remind me of beautiful speeches
Say to myself, I thank God for these beautiful creatures
Usually deep will be the feelin' every day we meet up
After we fuck, I'ma face you and kick my feet up
The way you hot inside is such a beautiful reminder
The type to make me comfortable puttin' my seed inside her
You're such a rider, love how you're such a fighter
And I wish that I could find a way to multiply her
I'll give it to her gentle, then I emulsify her
And when she asks to have it, I smash it and then we both retire
Put your hand up in the air, girl
Let me shine my light up on you earth while you in here, girl
Damn, you got me swingin', girl
What makes it hotter is mami and God's fan, girl
Yeah baby, you special, you're one of one
If the decision's up to us, we ain't never done
Let's get back to the fun
