[Intro]
They turned me on...

[Verse 1]
I fell asleep in my clothes
Watching videos
I was up all night
I was too excited to go to sleep

When I was 9 years old
I watched Solid Gold
Everything was alright
Sure 'nough put something inside of me

[Chorus]
I was made in the 80s
I was made in the 80s

[Verse 2]
I heard the Culture Club
And I fell in love
They were singing to me
And Billy Idol was real rock 'n' roll

I loved Duran Duran
And did the Safety Dance
In front of my TV
And all the greatest songs are from Billy Joel

[Chorus]
We were made in the 80s
We were made in the 80s

[Verse 3]
Madonna was obscene
And Michael Jackson was King
And hair metal was God
The unofficial fifth member of the Mötley Crüe

RUN-D.M.C
Looked just like me
God bless your heart
I owe everything I am to all of you

[Chorus]
I was made in the 80s (ah yeah, ah right)
Made in the 80s (ah yeah, ah right)

[Outro]
Dance
Come on
Dance with me
