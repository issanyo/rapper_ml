[Verse 1: Cee-Lo Green]

This song summons the spirit of a soul stolen away. Sad, but true
And it works every time, but it hurts every time. But it's somethin' I had to do
Gloria's from a small town where thinkin' out loud's against the law
Then she realized she felt a whole lot better with her back against the wall
(She said) "This fire inside me, how dare this place deprive me?"
"I want this. I NEED this. I'm wounded and I bleed this"
She was the real thing, a rebel soul; woulda died to be here tonight
And she did, so I sing this to celebrate her life

Chorus [x2]

Gloria, star down the power sister
Gloria, I make you this promise that I
I'll cry for you. No I will never
Let your life be in vain. You're gonna live forever!

[Verse 2: Big Gipp]

A conversation quickly turned into confrontation
No longer daddy's little girl, that was confirmation
Stubborn like her mother was, her spirit was so free
She ain't take no for an answer, he found that rather unique
Her soul was meek, but she was a renegade for hip-hop
Daddy called it devil music and said it had to stop
Instead of the shots, she stole the keys and took the car and left
I guess it was nice to know that I was loved to death

Chorus [x2]

[Verse 3: Khujo]

Runnin' runnin' to get away
Happened too fast to be afraid
Time, time ain't on our side
Heaven or hell, you decide

Put your lighters in the air to show you really care
Hold your neighbor's hands, close your eyes and say a prayer
I feel it in the air, her presence everywhere
We celebrate her spirit, I can hear the people cheer

Chorus [x2]
