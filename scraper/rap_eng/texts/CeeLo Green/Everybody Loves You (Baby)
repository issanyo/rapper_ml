[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a story about a girl I know
She became a good friend of mine so many years ago
Something special about her, but not too good to be true
But with a running start, I bet she could take off and fly if she wanted to
A gorgeous girl, what a sight to see
And you can be yourself around her, 'cause she gave you the right to be
And someday, she's gonna be somebody's perfect wife
And in her yearbook she was voted most likely to have a perfect life, alright

[Chorus]
Everybody loves you baby
They love you just the way you are
Everybody loves you baby
The soundtrack to the life of a superstar

[Verse 2]
But nobody knows the trouble she's seen
She unwillingly lost her virginity at the age of 15
Yeah, you can look, but you better not touch
'Cause the boy next door must have loved her just a little bit too much

But she's still smiling
I think she's got a gift
The way she can help people with smaller problems than hers they're having a harder time with
And she is still a mystery
And finding her is so much fun
And if you ever get to meet her I guarantee you're going to know that she's the one

[Chorus]
