[Intro: Christina Aguilera & CeeLo Green]
Fight the darkness, sing the song
Fight the darkness, sing the song
Fight the darkness, sing the song
Move, move, move, move, move, move
Move, move, move, move, move, move

[Verse 1: Christina Aguilera]
If one smile can erase a frown
Imagine what two can do (turn it up)
And if one voice could change a heart
Imagine what two can do (turn it up, hey)

[Pre-Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
The time is now, no time to wait
Turn up the love, turn down the hate
Turn up the love, turn down the hate
That, that sounds good, let the record play
The time is now, no need to wait
Turn up the love say, speakers vibrate
No time to wait

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera & CeeLo Green]
Make the world move
Move, move, move, move, move. move
Come on and make the world move
Move, move, move, move, move. move
Spinning faster, 'round and 'round
Let me hear that future sound
Move, move, move, move, move, move

[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]
If you and I can compromise
Imagine what a few could do (turn it up, yeah)
Don't listen to the point of view
Them haters ain't foolin' you (turn it up, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
The time is now, no time to wait
Turn up the love, turn down the hate
Turn up the love, turn down the hate
That, that sounds good, let the record play
The time is now, no need to wait
Turn up the love say, speakers vibrate
No time to wait

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera & CeeLo Green]
Make the world move
Move, move, move, move, move, move
Come on and make the world move
Move, move, move, move, move, move
Spinning faster, 'round and 'round
Let me hear that future sound
Move, move, move, move, move, move
Yeah, it starts with me and you
Make the world move

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
Just think about it, anybody
Could love somebody (oh, oh oh)
'Cause if anybody could love somebody
So could everybody (oh, oh oh)
I'mma need somebody to help somebody
Will you need somebody?
The time is now, no time to wait
Turn up the love, turn down the hate
Turn up the love, turn up the love
Turn up the love, the love, the love, the love
Hey, yeah

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera & CeeLo Green]
Make the world move
Move, move, move, move, move, move
Come on and make the world move
Move, move, move, move, move, move
Spinning faster, 'round and 'round
Let me hear that future sound
Move, move, move, move, move, move
It starts with me and you
Make the world move
