[Intro: CeeLo Green]
(Humming chorus)
Hehh, alright
Southside
Ehhh

[Verse 1: CeeLo Green]
Late last night, I went to sleep with the power
Woke up early this mornin' with the power
Kill and eat and devour any doubter
Ain't nothin' soft 'round here but the powder
On my last name, I never dreamed(?) I could cook it
Its all muscle in my wrist, so basically I took it
43 percent the tax bracket's on the paper
And richer than the average nigga 20 years later
So if he need these finances fixed, I can float 'em
And if he want this bag on the right, well I can quote him
Can't naw nigga on earth say I owe him
Cross me and I'll kill 'em like I never know him
Nigga talkin' bout my [?] he on the computer
Ssh, its a secret but I'm my own shooter
Talkin' real shit to ya but I ain't playin'
But if it can't go without sayin'

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
I got the power / power
Oh Oh Oh / power
In me
I got the power / power
Oh Oh Oh / power
In me

[Verse 2: Tone Trump]
Voil√†, can't complain with the work
Started from the curb, now we flyin' with the birds
Turnin' white into gold, turnin' green into platinum
We was doin' the shootin', they was doin' the rattin'
(Ssh) You know there's power in silence
Praying for peace but the money bring violence
Law no. 9: Win through actions, never argue
All that fussinen' and fightin'
Shit, that's what broads do
Shinin' since a baby, that's what stars do
Power like Putin, hated like the President
Had to make a way, they ain't wanna let me in
Hustler of the year, ask the youngins and the veterans
Self made, self paid, now I got the power
Maybach ridin', champagne and some sour
Top notch mob, stay away from them cowards
R.I.P. Huss(?), teddy bears and some flowers

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
I got the power / power
Oh Oh Oh / power
In me
I got the power / power
Oh Oh Oh / power
In me
(Humming chorus)
