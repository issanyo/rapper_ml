[Intro]
Guiding star, shining down on me
Destiny, it's my destiny
To laugh and cry and live and die
Graciously

[Verse 1]
I've been thinking bout it lately
Trying to find a way to live forever
Now wouldn't that be amazing
But don't you ever say never
Say I wanna be wild and I wanna be free
Knowing that nothing is promised to me
It feels even better than your favorite sin
To dance like somebody is watching

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm living the dream
And I know what it means
Tonight, we're dancing all over the world
And everybody is a star
Yes we are

[Verse 2]
Oh good lord, I'm ready
Ready to get to move it
I wanna do something
Something that's worth doing
I wanna be wild, I wanna be free
Knowing that nothing is promised to me
It feels even better than your favorite sin
To dance like somebody is watching

[Chorus]

[Bridge x2]
Why waste your time waiting on forever
I say forever can wait
Live in the moment as long as you own it
Forever may be too late

[Chorus]
