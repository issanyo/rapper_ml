[Verse 1 - Cee-Lo Green]
I've been living for the weekend
But no not any more
Cause here comes that familiar feeling
That Friday's famous for
Yeah I'm looking for some action
And it's out there somewhere
You can feel the electricity
All in the evening air
And it may just be more of the same
But sometimes you wanna go
Where everyone knows your name
So I guess I'll have to wait and see
But I'm just gonna let something
Brand new happen to me

[Hook]
And it's alright
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight

[Verse 2 - Cee-Lo Green]
Now Friday is cool
But there's something about Saturday night
You can't say what you won't do
Cause you know that you just might
I'm alive this evening
It was love at first sight
A-this Saturday, and every
Saturday for the rest of my life
And everyone's standing in line
Yeah looking good
And looking for a real good time
So I'll never have to wonder if
I'll have someone to share all of this with

[Hook]
And it's alright
Bright lights and the big city
It belongs to us tonight

[Verse 3 - Wiz Khalifa]
Hear the night life when it's calling
So we drink until we falling
Ain't a Laker but I'm balling
Meet about 3 girls and
I brought these girls to the club
Can I get em all in
Make a movie and let 'em star in it
Get drunk, get her in my car and
Do the same thing in the morning
Hear 'em hatin' but we ignore them
Which one wanna go
Rolling this green, hit one on the low
Champagne, meet broads on the floor
We getting bread so we toast
To the life and the fact that we major
Not to mention we Taylor
Been in the game, player
Who up next like neighbors?
