[Intro]
So, when you go home tonight, there should be one word to describe your night
Okay?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind, yeah
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space (yeah, hey)
When you're out there
Without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I think I just knew too much
Sing it with me

[Chorus]
I think I'm crazy
Well, I think I'm crazy
I think I'm crazy
Probably, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
My heroes had the time at the time of your life
Oh, but I'm thinking, uh
That you already know
Oh, no, know, yeah
Come on, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Yeah, ha-ha-ha, bless your soul, oh, eh
You really think you're in control?
Well, I don't

[Chorus]
I think you're crazy
Well, I think you're crazy
Well, I think you're crazy
Just like me, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
My heroes had the right
To lose their lives out on the limb, eh, uh
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna like them, oh
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looks like fun
So it's no coincidence I've come, hey!
And I can die when I'm done (oh)

[Chorus]
That makes me crazy
That makes you crazy
That makes me crazy
Probably, possibly, oh
Hey, hey
That makes me crazy
I said "that makes me crazy"
That make me crazy, yeah

[Outro]
Don't wanna be crazy
I just can't sleep
I get so excited
I am too deep
Ohh, crazy
But it feels alright, oh
Thankyou so much!
