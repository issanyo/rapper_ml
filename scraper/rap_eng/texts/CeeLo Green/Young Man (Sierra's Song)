Hey baby, hey baby
Hi-iiii
Laaaa, ughhhhh
Hey-ey

Hey there young man it seems like your sight's been blinded
Oh how I wish you could see
The very life that you're lived been tailored by many and mixed in ability
Oh I wish you'd do more than just keepin it real
Why don't you try being true?
One song could save the life of the young ones dependin on you
Hey young man

Hey young man I understand why you so angry
I grew up exactly the same
Daddy was gone so you had to find your own way
And he's convenient to blame
Despite those circumstances don't you stop standin
Don't Give up whatever you do
Cause just like you once were now your son's dependin on you
Hey young man

Hey there young man why degrade your only sister
And call them bitches and whores?
What if one day someone feels the same way
About that daughter of yours?
Oh if you had one inkling of an idea
Of what they had to go through
Of course she's strong but she's still depending on you
Hey young man, hey young man

Hold on
Ooooo, oooo
Well well (singing in the background)
[Laughing]
Alright y'all
(beat fades out)
