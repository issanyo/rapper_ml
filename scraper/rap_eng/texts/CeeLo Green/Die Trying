See there's no way and there's no how
That I could stop now
I'mma die tryin', I'mma die trying
And sometimes I get weak from walking the road I'm on
But I'mma keep on. I'mma die tryin', I'mma die tryin' (MMMMMM)

Before we came being southern wasn't something to claim
That flag wasn't something to fly it was something to blame
Smilin' and shuckin' and jivin' I was so ashamed
They did us dirty, apparently an appropriate name
I wrote about a revolution and sung from the soul
Spoke with my spirit and mind, my ambition was blind
Answering the call of God like a child obeying
Preaching the very same proverbs they killed Martin for saying
But you can't break the mold in by holding your breath
Thought if I died for you, that would be an honorable death
So sincere my eyes begin to swell up and tear
And it's clear, my music may not do well up in here
Oh my god being a nigga must be a good payin job
With all the fringe benefits, ignorance is bliss
There is a time and a place for everybody's taste
But I know too much and I owe too much

[Hook]

So here it is, an invitation to an open book
A painful past, my heart is still broken look
I know you don't hate me, just not assured that anyone appreciate me
See I've been having a hard time selling my albums lately
In recent news The Source couldn't find any microphones to rate me
Using words like "extreme" and "alternative" to equate me
Which is true I'm in a box with a view but you still wanna gate me?
I could be a pretty good thug but it wouldn't compare to a great me
The final cross to bear, this mine, it's not a cross to share
But isn't it ironic I still went and bought a cross to wear
That obviously cost to wear
But considerably less than the price that it costs to care
And I don't have another loss to spare, how dare them say that I can't win
Even though I know talking intelligent just ain't in
You most likely to go broke when you just can't bend
So me and JJ both gon' have to paint then

Listen
People +Still Standing+ in line at the +World Party+ for some +Soul Food+
To get put back in that old mood
They say we like the new 'Lo
And we respect everything you trying to do 'Lo
Do what you do but just do more that you know
It's a catch 22 and I couldn't cry
And I'm under oath with them both and I couldn't lie
Custom said that I'm too dope and I coudln't fly
And you getting rich talkin shit so why shouldn't I?
I'm just playing but I guess that couldn't go without saying
I'm just gon ride this evolution until it stop me where I'm staying
But I ain't gonna have to lie to ya to make it sound fly to ya
I keep my feet on the ground and bring the sky to ya
