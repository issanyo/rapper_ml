Ooooooohhhh
Ahhhhh!

[Verse 1: Alice Smith]
That real, That deep, That burning
That amazing unconditional, inseparable love
That feel like forever
That always emotional but still exceptional love
Oooh, can't nobody tell me nothing
Said it is what is, I-I
Any mistake you make, I, I just might forgive, Ooooh
And right now, right now, at this very moment
I still love him like I loved him then
Oh, I love him in and out and up and down
And round and round
And over and over again
So rare they swear that you just don't exist
And it's only one person I think of make me feel like this

[Chorus]
And, I'm a fool
Such a fool
For you

[Verse 2: Alice Smith]
That deep, that sweet
That something, that wet
That fire, powerful stuff
That up and that down
That front and that back
Baby I can't seem to get enough
Ooooh, baby let me do it
Let me do it 'til I'm satisfied, I-I
Baby, now, right now, baby I ain't got no more pride
Sweet sugar, I surrender
I don't want no other man
Baby you win
And you ain't never got to worry, ever got to worry
You'll never be alone again
There's nothin', there's nothin' that, woo, that I wouldn't do
I-I wrote a song about it
Er'body know who I'm talkin' to

[Chorus]
And, I'm a fool
Such a fool
For you

And, I'm a fool
Such a fool
For you
