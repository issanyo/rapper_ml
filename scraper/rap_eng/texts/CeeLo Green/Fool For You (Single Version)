[Verse 1: CeeLo Green]
What?! That real, that deep, that burning, that amazing unconditional, inseparable love
That feel like forever
That always emotional but still exceptional love
Can't nobody tell me nothing it is what it is, and
Any mistake you make I, I just may forgive
Oh!
Right now, right now at this very moment
Still love her like I loved her then
Oh, I love her in and out and up and down and 'round and 'round
And over and over again
So rare they swear that you just don't exist, and
It's only one person I can think of make me feel like this
And I'm a fool, such a fool!
For you!

[Verse 2: Melanie Fiona]
Oh! So sweet, so deep
So real, ooh wee God damn, that's some powerful stuff
Oh!
How you do it do-do-do it, keep it coming, baby, I can't seem to get enough
What you do, what you say
Makes me want to lo-lo-love you
Baby, I don't even have a choice
Oh! And if I did it'd still be you
Cause you're the man among these other boys
Sweet sugar, I surrender
White flag, oh, I won't even put up a fight
Oh! Cause there ain't a damn thing wrong about this kind of loving
Ooh, when it feels so right
Call her, write a letter, tell it to my mama
And she gon' tell the world that I love you!
Oh! Some people probably say I'm crazy
But I don't mind, being a fool for you

[Chorus: Both]
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, such a fool
Such a fool, such a fool, such a fool
For you
