[Verse 1]
Basically, I'm complicated
I have a hard time taking the easy way
I wouldn't call it schizophrenia
But I'll be at least two people, today
If that's okay

[Chorus]
And I can go on and on and on... but who cares?

[Verse 2]
It's deep how you can be so shallow
And I'm afraid 'cause I have no fear
And I didn't believe in magic
Until I watched you disappear
I wish you were here

[Chorus]
And I can go on and on and on... but who cares?

[Verse 3]
You see, everybody is somebody
But nobody wants to be themselves
And if I ever wanted to understand me
I'd have to talk to someone else
'Cause every little bit helps

[Chorus]
And I can go on and on and on... but who cares?

[Verse 4] (x2)
Feels like the surreal life
But, it's still nice
Wish I could live twice
But, I still might
If these wounds heal right
I see a little light
Even though it's still night

[Chorus]
And I can go on and on and on... but who cares?

And I can go on and on and on... but who cares?
