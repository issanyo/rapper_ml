[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
I am the one and only son of a machine gun
Incomparable, meaning I can't be placed in between none
Even in Darkness, I radiate distinction
It's so bold you could smell that funk with a cold
It's unbelievable, bare a resemblance to broken mold
I'm op-timistic, I'm the air in the open road
Make ya move it's moderate, no need to speed
It's inevitable you arrive in due time indeed
Now is the, time and place to invade the empty space
I'm a perfectionist, I never pressure the pen space
But I wouldn't be amazing without God's Amazing Grace
I can travel outer space while standin' in one place

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Hippy to the hop, like a digi-log frog
Throw me the cat and I'll throw you the dog {*bark*}
Simple as a dimple, ain't it?
A hole in your cheek, let's hit the town so we can paint it
Red — or maybe baby blue for two
As sure as you are my lover, that is my favorite color
And we get down — off to my castle we drown
In each others love we puddle, huddle — break, fourth down, and inches (Ahh!)
We all some players, don't ride no benches (Ahh!)
Elegant princess come to your senses (Ahh!)
I noticed that your one of a kind
That's makes you kind of the one
I'm, sharing my spaghetti with —
The Lady and The Tramp, the mystery, the myth
Not into runnin' trains, but I got a thang for ya
Swoosh! I will do ya, truly I adore ya

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
Gipp, a 2002 ho-bo
What your ticket say? 2A? You're going my way
Went from Ragtime buddy to a cakewalk stage
Didn't ask 'cause I past you made this way
My impression is one and no other
Kinda-sorta your, Dr. Demento, had to come through and lap
Dog the Organized instrumental
We gon' keep it on the track and the gristle
This Express, hear the whistle? {*train horn*}

[Verse 4: Backbone]
Who them niggas changed the face of the game?
And brought it back "5, Deuce, 4, Tre"
The alliance of elite emcees
Attention, salute, at ease
The world renowned, from here clean across seas
It's the critically acclaimed, Dungeon Family
We are now boarding, all seats and all rows
But it ain't no more tickets 'cause it's a sold-out show

[Verse 5: Big Boi]
I Stank I can, I Stank I can, I know I can, I will
The nigga B-I-G be knocking players off the field, for real
Dungeon Family got my sword and shield
To Campbellton, not Camelot, let's smoke a joint and chill
(Chill?) Like four babies, and now you want the pill
Used to be raw dawg but now you want the grill
Seville flawless, so now you wanna drill
And taking a groupie home is just like loving some roadkill
Pimpin' and panderin' on a level you can't serve
Dismantle, nouns, pronouns, adverbs, and verbs
I spit the words of wordsmith, higher than a bird's dick
Sip-sip, sip-sip, "Sippin' on Some Syrup" like Three 6
Engine Number 9 is on the grind
Like ya molars when ya rollin', that's your back teeth bitin' down
Now open up and say it, the D to the F's the greatest
The talented town, continue to dream, your head has been deflated
