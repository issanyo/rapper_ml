[Verse]
In this house the decor is the obvious obscure
You can see clearly the theory of less is more
A plant, a pet, and books on a shelf
And a frame on the wall where you can
Picture yourself
And you're welcome to stay
But even your company must complement The Feng Shui
Ah, Even down to what I have on
They do wonder to what extents I have gone
Tailored and tapered, contoured to the curve
Demanding the attention that it does deserve
Fabrics for the forecast of the day
Admit it: everything is fitted to fall in Feng Shui
More importantly the way that I move
If I'm in your town, my needle's down on the groove
On sight they know my song
And it ain't slow and it sure ain't long
You see I do not play
Forgive me father I was forced out of Feng Shui
A flow as subtle as a summer breeze
Like the whispering winds and the talking trees
To big to be boxed in, it bobs and weaves
It evolves, it solves, it gives and receives
And everything I say is calculated appropriated
Written and arranged in Feng Shui!
