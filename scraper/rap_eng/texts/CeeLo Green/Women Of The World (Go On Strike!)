[Intro]
United girls, united girls
Get united girls, united girls
Get united girls

[Hook]
What if the women of the world went on strike?
What if they finally decided to end this fight?
And because of your broken heart you have every right
What if the women of the world went on strike?

[Verse 1]
Honey come and hold my hand
Please forgive me, I'm only a man
Thought your silence meant you understood
But please don't give up for good (no)

[Pre-Hook]
Where I sat and I imagine
Or every man that has a girl
If there was no more mothers and no more lovers
Nothing would be left, it scares me to death

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, yes I know
The world ends as I know it, please don't go
I am so so ashamed and afraid (so afraid)
Of the mess that we made

[Pre-Hook]
[Hook]

[Bridge]
We know we lied and wasted time
We should have listened, ladies
Without love we could not live with us, without you
So talk to us, take us higher
Your love brings us out of this fire
And you're the object of my desire

[Hook]

[Outro]
United girls, united girls
Get united girls, united girls
Get united girls, united girls
Get united girls, united girls
