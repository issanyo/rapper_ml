Up, up and away, she goes
Now I know that I know she knows
Who would want to live a lie?
But, neither will I
If she still tried to try
But remarkably, my son
All my work is done

Wouldn't surprise me to see her ghost
She would like me to know she knows
And I'm almost sure
I was absolutely nothing before
Now, I'm so, so much more
The one word that describes the past
I'm pretty much possessed

We are the reason, I suppose
And we've spoken, so I know she knows
Though, what's one to sacrifice
When you live more than twice?
Oh, but I bet it's nice
Gonna be just like you;
I'm giving my life, too
No other woman would wear your clothes
And it goes without saying, she knows
She knows
