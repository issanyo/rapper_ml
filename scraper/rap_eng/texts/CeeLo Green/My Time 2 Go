Some trill shit, nigga
Dirty South
Cee-Lo B, P.A
One time

[Hook]
Maybe it's my time to go, tomorrow or today
I live it how I live it anyway
Who knows, as the warriors flay [flee]

Maybe it's my time to go, tomorrow or today
I live it how I live it anyway
Who knows, as the warriors play

[Big Reese]
Now nigga, if I was gone in the morn', would you
Motherfuckers really miss me?
Act like y'all care, shed a tear, hollar y'all wish we
Spent more time together
Write my momma a letter
Miss Bridges, we feel your pain
Shoot my little girl some change
Keep my name on these streets
Said these niggas I had the beats
Plus the flow, pray for my soul
The cars and the clothes, the money, the hoes
You knows, that shit was like candy
Wanted to walk right, but the world inside ran me
My momma couldn't stand me, own girl abandoned me
19 with no friends and no types of family
Just a street statty
Showed me to hustle, take what I want with muscle
Put that money on a slab, cut it up and juggle
Invest in proper heat cause on these streets is trouble
For sure, but when it's time to go, ain't none of this
Shit gon' help you
Just make your final stop hotter
So I prayed to my father
When I hit your gates, bear my weight
Cause shit, we all make mistakes

[Hook]
Maybe it's my time to go, tomorrow or today
I live it how I live it anyway
Who knows, as the warriors flay [flee]

Maybe it's my time to go, tomorrow or today
I live it how I live it anyway
Who knows, as the warriors play

[K.P.]
Haha, I don't think grandmama liked me, she looked at me too mean
The family took credit, but I bought the 50 inch screen
You talk, but I heard the streets, it ain't about what you taught us
Your thug ass grandson, your dyke ass grandaughters
Senile ass sister, alcoholic ass brother
Husband disability check getter, who could buy a motherfucker
But yet I get labeled, something more trife than is heathen
But who paid the bill when you was complaining bout freezing?
Sharper too, a street vet, so good that it's sick
Took my Desert Eagle back, cause it packed too much kick
Shit, should be ashamed, you see how drunk that I get?
Left there drinking, breath stinking, 5 in the morning I'm thinking
Hit my girl' crib, she clowning, bitch be talking bout nothing
Asking me to change my ways when I'm thinking bout fucking
Look here, my time to go could be today or tomorrow
I'm gon' live how I live, no regrets and no sorrow

[Hook]
Maybe it's my time to go, tomorrow or today
I live it how I live it anyway
Who knows, as the warriors flay [flee]

Maybe it's my time to go, tomorrow or today
I live it how I live it anyway
Who knows, as the warriors play

[Cee-Lo]
Uh huh, yo, we are the brilliant, bizarre, shining southern star
Hypnotic, we art it, while others licking the guitar
Solar systems are passing, mental meteor showers
Infinite internet into the next high times of ours
But, how was that B? That's what, I'm almost free
Right back, deep in some negativity
I dream with my eyes open, you might not with your goals
I'm known for the righteous raps, and this is one of those
I'm loving the life I'm living, I'm driven to do you right
Meditate, re-iterate, I've decided to share the light
To all the souls feeling like a free bird taking flight
I mean this unmistakable magic with my mind
I'm totally committed to the scriptures being a spitter
I ain't broke cause I ain't [a] bullshitter
Keep my (?) fitted
Ask me how and why I do it
I'll say ballings how I did it
We there for the shit, with it
What with y'all? Well go get it

[Hook]
Maybe it's my time to go, tomorrow or today
I live it how I live it anyway
Who knows, as the warriors flay [flee]

Maybe it's my time to go, tomorrow or today
I live it how I live it anyway
Who knows, as the warriors play

Maybe it's my time to go, tomorrow or today
I live it how I live it anyway
Who knows, as the warriors play

Sex, drugs, money, violence... [fades to static]
