[Hot Tub]
Hit the jets
And watch us blast off

[Cee-Lo]
There's something going on beneath the water
People getting hot
Making sons and daughters
It's just you and me
And L-U-V in the T-U-B

[Francine]
Hot tub... of love

[Cee-Lo]
Bubbles in the tub
Bubbles in the glass
Fig in your mouth
And my finger in your....

[Bass]
Bass

[Cee-Lo]
Making love tonight
Making intercontinental looove tonight

[Francine]
Are we above Egypt?

[Stan]
That's Mount Rushmore

[Cee-Lo]
Giving you a hickey over the mighty Mississippi
Sucking on your toe over downtown Tokyo
We're doing this dance over Paris, France

[Stan]
Chuck Berry me
Over Germany

[Cee-Lo]
We're going all the way
'Cause it's not a race
We can take it slow into outer spaaaaace
It's just you and me

[Francine]
Hot tub... of love

[Missile launch]

[Cee-Lo]
Mmm, yeah
We can take our time
Don't have to wait in line
This hot tub's in the V.I.P. tonight

Gimme the address to the ocean
I'm 'bout to write it a letter
You may be the ocean
But I'm hotter and wetter

[Steve]
Hey-hey-hey!
Hey-hey-hey!
Heeey!
[Song cuts off]
Dad! Hey?!
