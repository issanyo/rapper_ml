[Chorus]
I see you driving down town with the girl I love
And I'm like
Fuck you!
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like
Ah fuck!

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry
I can't afford a Ferrari
But I got something that’ll get you there
Say she’s an Xbox and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
Aaaaah
She’s a gold digger
She’s a gold digger
Oooooooooh
I've got some news for you
Why don’t you go tell your fucking boyfriend

[Chorus]
I see you driving down town with the girl I love
And I'm like Fuck you!
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like Fuck you and fuck her too!
I said if I was richer, I'd still be here with ya
Ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
And Fuck you!
Ooo,ooo,ooo

[Verse 2]
Now I know
I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
(Beg and steal and lie and cheat.)
Trying to keep ya
Trying to please ya
'Cause being with your ass ain't cheap

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
Aaaaah
She’s a gold digger
She’s a motherfucking gold digger
Oooooooooh
I've got some news for you
Ooh, I really hate your ass right now


[Chorus]
I see you driving down town with the girl I love
And I'm like Fuck you!
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like Fuck you and fuck her too!
I said if I was richer, I'd still be here with ya
Ain't that some shit?
(Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
And Fuck you!
Ooo,ooo,ooo

[Bridge]
Now baby, baby, baby, why you why you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my mamma but she told me
It’s one for your dad
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
So I tell her like
Whhhhy?
Whhhhy?
Whhhhy, oh baby?
I love you
Still thinking of you
Oooh!

[Breakdown]
I see you driving down town with the girl I love
And I'm like Fuck you! (So fuck you, bitch!)
So fuck you...

[Outro]
I see you driving down town with the girl I love
And I'm like Fuck you!
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like Fuck you and (come on, one more time)

I see you driving down town with the girl I love
And I'm like Fuck you!
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like Fuck you
