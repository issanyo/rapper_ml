[Intro: Rick Ross]
I just wanna see my mama smile
Here I go

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I went unconscious, I woke up to see my mama smile
She told me no more promethazine, that'll make her proud
Think about it, damn I had to think about it
Gimme a second, mama, lemme think about it
I went unconscious, I woke up to see my mama smile
She told me no more promethazine, that'll make her proud
Think about it, damn I had to think about it
Gimme a second, mama, lemme think about it
Never had the chance to tell my dad I was a Yankee fan
True love is unconditional, money don’t make the man
First time me in a batting cage, I knew I had a gift
Which I had to skip, I'm at the car wash trying to make a tip
Positivity is all I got to give
When we was kids, it was steel now it's time to live
That's why I throw a pinkie ring up when I post a pic
It's for my niggas on they dick, "Look what this nigga did!"
Think about it, think about it
40 M's in my Timbs, still ridin' rims
Word on the streets, they say that nigga get a lot of cake
I take the time, I kiss both cheeks on my mamas face

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
Just smile!
The world had to make me a man, but I'll always be your child!
Mama just smile!
Most importantly, I want you to be proud! Mama just smile!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
No I never really mind that we caught the bus
Or that we always stand in line, I’m talkin' all of us
It made me stronger, it made me quicker on my feet
All the gain she gave me the love that she would teach
Turn me onto real estate we bought us 50 homes
Who really gonna be your shoulder when your kidneys gone
Who really gonna be your rider when the Bentley's gone?
Or when they singin' like a choir in a Christmas song?
Mama! Always depend on my mama
Just bought another Benz for my mama
I always keep it real with my mama
She harder than a rock
Throw her parties on the block for my mama
I just wanna see my mama smile

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
Just smile!
The world had to make me a man, but I'll always be your child!
Mama just smile!
Most importantly, I want you to be proud! Mama just smile!

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
Makes me happy just to see a smile on her face
Perfect mother and I love you, tell you every day
You always was a black queen, mama
You showed me all the best things, mama

[Outro: Cee-Lo Green]
I am at love
Your flesh and your blood
Your unconditional love inside of me
