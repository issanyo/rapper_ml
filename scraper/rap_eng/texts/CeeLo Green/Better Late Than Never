[Intro]
It might sound crazy
But I think I recognize her from a dream
She’s the most beautiful girl
That I’ve never seen Instantly

[Verse 1]
I'm in love she’s the same as she was
At the thing that she does
I just smile and I stare
Should go over and see
If she remembers me
Cause there still seems to be
One more empty chair
It's destiny if you believe in that type of thing
Oh
And I was wondering where’s your wedding ring
Let’s get reacquainted
This is nice ain't it
You look beautiful tonight
And this could be the beginning of the rest of your life

[Chorus]
And if it were left up to me
I would have already met her
But it’s better
(Better)
It’s better late than never

[Verse 2]
I would love a perfect woman
But you can’t create her
Now see a friend of a friend of a friend
Used to date her
He used to brag and he’d boast
How he loves her the most
And they seemed so close
And in love at the time
But soon after she found
He was getting around
She deserves to be loved
But one at a time
At first he felt like it couldn’t be explained
Oh but I love you girl
And I am not ashamed
Oooh
Oh I can’t wait
Step out on faith
Love and trust
And he ended up being happy for the both of us

[Chorus]
If it were left up to me
I would’ve already met her
But it’s better
(Better)
It’s better late than never
And we should cherish
Oh this moment together
Cause it’s better
It’s better late than never

[Bridge]
I've been waiting
Waiting and waiting
You’re mine baby

[Chorus]
If it were left up to me
I would’ve already met her
But it’s better
(Better)
It’s better late than never
If it were left up to me
I would’ve already met her
But it’s better
(Better)
It’s better late than never
