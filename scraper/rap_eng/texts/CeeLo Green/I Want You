Hey! I love the night life yes I do it's so much funnnnnn
And before you know it ahhh, here comes the sun
Sweetheart it's been real but, the thrill is gonnnnne
Mmm-hmm, and inside us
Is like a spirit, that picked my house to haunt
But I know it's there so I am nonchalant
Now the question is - just what do I want?
Well I want you, to run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done, just won't dooooooooo
I want youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

Would a trip to a remoted island ease your mind?
Oh you look like a solitaire in the sunshine
I like her cause she's fun, she's fearless, she's a friend of mine
Ohh and I'm not trying to say you need any help
You can have anything you want wit'cho bad self
I like her cause she's smart, but she's still sexy
She is something else, oooh; and that's why
I want you, to run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done, just won't dooooooooo
I want youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
And I want you, to tenderly and sincerely want me tooo
You can believe in me baby, don't be cruuuuuuel
I want youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

Oh one rarely finds a lady
That happens to be three times a lady
But God is good, but he took his time when he designed you baby
That's why I want you, and
Oh I'll even quit my job
Loving you I'll make it my job
Thank you Lord, thank you Lord, this is it my God
Thank you Lord, this is it my God; oh that's why
I want youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
And I want youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Sail away and experience something newwwwwwww
Anything you've already done, just won't dooooooooo
I want youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
And I want youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
To genuinely and sincerely want me toooo
You can believe in me baby, don't be cruuuuuuel
(I want youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu)
