[Intro: Vicci Martinez]
Oh, come along with me

[Verse 1: Vicci Martinez]
Play with it while you have hands
Dust settles, cities turn to sand
Trespassing; this is their land
Time flies, make a statement, take a stand

[Chorus: Vicci Martinez]
Come along now, come along with me
Come along now, come along and you'll see
What it's like to be free
(Yeah)
Come along, come along with me
Come along now, come along and you'll see
What it's like to be free
(Yeah)
Come along now, come along with me
And I'll ease your pain
Come along, come along with me
And let's seize this day
Come along, come along with me

[Verse 2: Cee-Lo Green & (Vicci Martinez)]
Huh
Stay out, stay clear, but stay close (Stay close)
Friends, foes, God only knows
Let's be the thorn on the rose
Time flies, make a statement, strike a pose

[Chorus: Vicci Martinez & (Cee-Lo Green)]
Come along now, come along with me
Come along now, come along and you'll see
What it's like to be free
(Yeah)
Come along, come along with me
Come along now, come along and you'll see
What it's like to be free
(Yeah)
Come along now, come along with me
And I'll ease your pain (I'll ease your pain)
Come along, come along with me
And let's seize this day
Oh, come along with me
(Mm-hmm)
(Huh)

[Bridge: Vicci Martinez & Cee-Lo Green]
Time flies, make a statement, take a stand
Time flies, make a statement, take a stand
Time flies, make a statement, take a stand
Time flies, take your chance

[Chorus: Vicci Martinez]
Come along now, come along with me
Come along now, come along and you'll see
What it's like to be free
(What it's like to be free)
Come along, come along with me
Come along now, come along and you'll see
What it's like to be free
(What it's like to be)
Come along now, come along with me
And I'll ease your pain
Come along, come along with me
Oh, let's seize this day
Oh, come along with me
Oh, come along with me
