Bass Head Jazz...

Bass Head
Feel like I'm walkin' across the sky
Getting high on Bass Head Jazz
The world is spinning so slow
We ain't got nowhere to go
Bass Head
Let your mind be free
Enter a new zone of understanding
Gotta get high to get down
Feel like I'm walkin' across the sky
Getting high on Bass Head Jazz
