[Intro:]
Yeah
Oh this right here was inevitable
Oh yeah it had to be done, too

[Verse 1:]
Uh, I'm in this righteous game
Can't say that my life the same
Haters try to shoot you down like fighter planes
I swear this year I'm gon' stomp on all of them
This for the shorties I beep and never call again
Yeah I'm sorry you the fire, throw more at them
My stylo Cee-Lo, so it's fuck you no orgasm
This is Team Swelly, I am your captain
We just live life, then let the rest happen
Knew that my words or raps be certified CPA
This for the professors that wouldn't help my GPA
I be all fly, where's my ETA?
Man I love my haters, and this is PDA
They said "Nah Chiddy, why you tryin' chase your dreams? "
I think it's microscopic seeing more than they have seen
Dope beats, dope rhymes, now we made 'em fiends
This the type of shit that could bruise they esteem

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green Sample & Chiddy]
(And what I say?)
That's all I have to say
(When I was like)
It's like the only way
They say this the freshman pay
We gon' continue to shine on 'em anyway
I got love for 'em
They got hate for me
So...

[Verse 2:]
F you, too, a critic
The hate's on every lyric
And when you spit that dope shit, you just don't hear it
Like liquor I got the Spirit
But can't let the devil control me most
'Specially when I'm puffin' I got that holy ghost
Ayyy, so amen to that shit
I had to get a running start, like a backflip
I'm gone, can't reach me with postcards
Mozart game like Mario, go karts
The top is just an illusion, confusion
It's what a cause is, hold your applauses
I'm from up north, like Santa Claus is
This is a sitcom, we just in The Office
Thanks for sayin' I'll be a Gilbert Arenas
Late freshmen, but graduated with the seniors
And Jimmy Neutron, say, that boy a genius
And this is what I'm sayin' and I mean it

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green Sample & Chiddy]
(And what I say?)
That's all I have to say
(When I was like)
It's like the only way
They say this the freshman pay
We gon' continue to shine on 'em anyway
I got love for 'em
They got hate for me
So...
