"All their windows were dark. And no one knew he was there. All the Whos were all dreaming. Sweet dreams without care..."

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr Grinch
I wouldn't touch you with a
Thirty-nine and a half foot pole

"All I need is a reindeer! So he took his dog Max, and he took some black thread, and he tied a big horn on the top of his head. Then the Grinch said, "Giddyup!" and the sleigh started down toward the homes where the Who's lay a-snooze in their town! "Oh yeah! This is stop number one!" the old Grinchy Claus hissed as he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist. Then he slid down the chimney, a rather tight fit... But if Santa Claus could do it, then so could the Grinch! Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant around the whole room, and he took every present. Popguns, panpoolers, pantookers, and drums! Checkboards, bisslebigs, popcorn, and plums! He stuffed them in bags, then the Grinch very nimbly stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney!"

You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk
Mr Grinch

The three best words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote
Stink!
Stank!
Stunk!

You nauseate me, Mr Grinch
With a noxious super nos
You're a crooked jerky jockey and
You drive a crooked horse
Mr Grinch!

You're a three-decker sauerkraut
And toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce!
