[CeeLo Green]:
I started a war and I landed on my own sword
Wish I could take those stupid things I said
How could I be so foolish?

[CeeLo & Juliet Simms]:
When everybody says "time will clean up this mess"
But only you, only you
Only you can make me better put me back together
Come on baby, let's be real
Only you, only you, yeah
Only you could stop the bleeding, give me what I'm needing
To make sure my heart can heal, only you

[Juliet Simms]:
I'm dressing my wounds but the blood
It keeps soaking through
Oh yeah, I cut just a little bit too deep
And I feel so dizzy

When everybody says "time will clean up this mess"
But only you, only you
Only you can make it better
Put me back together
Come on baby, let's be real

[CeeLo]:
Only you, only you
Only you could stop the bleeding, give me what I'm needing
Make sure my heart can heal

[Juliet]:
Only you, only you
Only you can make it better
Put me back together
Come on baby, let's be real

[CeeLo & Juliet]:
Only you, only you
(Hey, hey, hey yeah)
Only you could stop the bleeding, give me what I'm needing
To make sure my heart can heal
Only you
