[Chorus 1]
Why won't you give me a reason why?
Babe, I'm begging you please
Oh, I suppose the redder the rose
The many more thorns, baby
The more thorns you find

[Verse 1]
Of the bouquet I chose
The most beautiful rose
And with my love I proposed
And round and round it goes
And up from the ground it grows
Eventually dies so slow
That's why I need to know

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
I find it hard to face
The one rose I put in a vase
Not knowing you need more space
Reminds me that I can feel
Reminds me that I can still heal
Cause I smell your fragrance still
And I always will

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Won't you give me a reason why?
You're making a grown man cry
I suppose the redder the rose
The many more thorns, baby
The more thorns you find

[Bridge]
They say that real men are not supposed to cry
Next time give me fake roses so they'll never die

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
