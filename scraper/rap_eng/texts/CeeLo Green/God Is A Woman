God is a woman
Although this idea's untraditional
I think God is a woman
Making each one of her children original
I stare at the sky until the stars start to fall
If there's a God at all
It's a woman

I'm just a man
Made up of milestone achievements
In my [?]
For I am just a man, child
Inspired by things I've seen
For things to say
So I kiss the ground I walk on
And she's the air I breathe
God is a beautiful woman
I believe

Oh, God, yeah
Praise God
Mmmm, mmmm, mmm, mmmm

God's still a woman
Although her human condition's contradictory
God's still a woman
She has made everything including history
So exalt her high above you
Beyond the brightest star
She'll be everywhere you are, are
She's your mother, oh, mmmm
I'm your brother, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh, mmmm
