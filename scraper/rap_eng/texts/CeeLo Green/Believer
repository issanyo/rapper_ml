[Chorus]
This is for the believers
Keep on fighting for love, shine a light for your love now
This is for the believers
Keep on fighting for love, shine a light for your love now
This is for the believers
Keep on fighting for love, shine a light for your love now
This is for the believers, this is for the believers
This is for the believers
Keep on fighting for love, shine a light for your love

[Verse 1]
My heart is broken and my wounds are wide open
But I still believe in love
It never ceases to amaze me 'cause the world's gone crazy
But I still believe in love
I know it ain't easy, but please don't give up yet

[Chorus]
This is for the believers
Keep on fighting for love, shine a light for your love now
This is for the believers
Keep on fighting for love, shine a light for your love now
This is for the believers, this is for the believers
This is for the believers
Keep on fighting for love, shine a light for your love

[Verse 2]
You're the reason that I wrote this
Hoping someone would notice that I still believe in love

[Chorus]
This is for the believers
Keep on fighting for love, shine a light for your love now
This is for the believers
Keep on fighting for love, shine a light for your love now
This is for the believers, this is for the believers
For the believers
