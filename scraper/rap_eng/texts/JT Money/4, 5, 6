[Sole']

[JT Money]
Mr. good dick, what you say?
[Sole']
I said where da fuck you at?!
[JT Money]
What how you feel?
How you say you feel?
[Sole']
I feel like you need to get home before yo shit be outside
[JT Money]
You say you daddy to come through and regulate?
What? Put his thang down, what? It's all good

[Verse 1: Sole']
It could be 4, 5 or 6, you bet' not be nowhere laid up wit no bitch
You betta bring that home to momma, don't be playin and shit
If you get horny when you out, no need for eyein' them hoes
Why eat a burger when you got steak and potatoes at home?
A short drive is all it takes, I'm just a phone call away
Ain't no excuses mutha fucka for you runnin astray
I give it to you when you want it ain't no other's like mine
Yo ex-bitch can't fuck with this, so don't be wastin' yo time
The Indian, black mix, boy like I told you before
And we can ay yi yi the fur rug on my living room floor
And ain't nan ho gon' bring it like you know I'mma bring it
And ain't nan ho gon' freak it like you know I'mma freak it
And ain't nan ho gon' shake it like you know I'mma shake it
And ain't nan ho gon' take it like you know I'mma take it
So don't make me come lookin for you, pull you outta some mix
Then turn around and bust you in yo shit for 4, 5 or 6

[Hook: Kandi]
I don't care if it's 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in the morning
Boy you better call me when you think you gettin horny
I don't give a damn bout who you with
Just as long as you ain't givin up my shit
(Repeat)

[Verse 2: JT Money]
You know me as your player, your pipe layer, your all night stayer
All up in your sauce when you need your rocks off
Knock your socks off, baby off the chain in this bitch
Have your wide ass open while I'm slangin' this dick
Got you lovin' this shit, suckin and fuckin this dick
Wanna go and make some bucks for this dick
Fightin' all in the club for this dick
I'm that player that you chose
Long as you satisfied, baby fuck them other hoes
Just keep my pussy horny so you can put it on me
Girl you know I'm the only one who can satisfy your monkey
Ain't nobody gon' do you like I do when I put this love stick inside you
Money man guaranteed to satisfy you
Have you open all night like a drive-through
So bring yo thang on so I can get my bang on
I hope you likes a good fuck because my game strong
And I ain't lyin' girl you wouldn't if you could quit
I signs my name on that pussy, Mr. Good Dick
That's my shit

(Hook: Kandi (Repeat)]

[Verse 3: Sole']
Now nigga what you gone do, ugh, let me put this good lovin on you
We can do everything that you want to
Cause I like it real freaky, nigga don't you
That's right, don't make no promises
Can't find none better than mommas is
Stay wet, stay tight, keep you comin' back
Go all night feelin' right, you be lovin that
Hell yeah, like wanna make enough moves
Fuckin you boy like I got something to prove
Runnin loose, fuck it nigga gotta pay dues
Make you wanna tell ya boys all about whose
No talkin' now, come get the good shit
Make you never wanna fuck another hood bitch
Have ya breakin' off plans to come and lay me
Mutha fucka, don't ever try and play me
