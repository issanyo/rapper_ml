Caught up
Dirty Game
Nigga I deal wit it though, you know
Shit ain't easy out there on them streets boy, you know
Y'all niggas watch yo ass boy, hold it down, fo'sho

[Hook]
They got me down but it ain't no thang

Got a nigga cased over so much game
And everybody goin through the same ole thang x2

[JT Money]
What up dogg hope you chillin cuz I ain't
I wish I could be out with the boys but I can't
I really dont know what kinda time a nigga facin
Can't get a bond cuz I ain't cooperatin
So ima strap down they gone take me for a ride
You'll look out for my shit while a nigga on the inside
Been here before so it really ain't shit
You'll let me know what's goin on in the streets and whats sum flix
Probably get a buzz when I think you got this letter
Shit is at it's worse and it can only get better
