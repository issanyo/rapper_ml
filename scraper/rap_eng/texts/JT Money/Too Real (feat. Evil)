(JT Money:)
I see alot of dumb niggas flaugin
Talkin bout how they livin large & ballin
All in the club pullin out dummy wads
Keep tryna flauge and that ass gon get scarred
Cause these jack boys always out workin
And we don't like fuck niggas that be perpin
Tryin to impress some trickin ass hoe
A nigga with sense keep that flow on the low
See only a fool will flash, smart niggas gon stash
Just get him somewhere so yo nigga can touch his ass
Would you do that? you know you gon be straight
Besides, the fuck nigga not to playa hate

Evil
See I'm flossin in the 8-50 lookin jiggy
I know this nigga suspect, too fuckin pretty
Frostbit bracelet, rockin the best
Like Eugene Robinson, cruisin for sex
Tryna hit me for the 40 baby, I'm bout to flex
