[Snoring]

[intro]
I taught you for three years, instructing you to fight Poison Clan techniques. Here, I must tell you that the clan is a danger to the public. We live here in seclusion so we can talk about the poison clan. Still, for many men- just to hear of the name fills them with hate and loath
But why? They never harmed anyone
I'm afraid they did in the past
Before I join your clan- the point is, I had pupils once
Is that a fact? What are their names? Where are they?
I don't know their names now- when they left they all took new names
