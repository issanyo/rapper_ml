Rapped and relapsed
I'm back at it like a crack addict
Problematic and erratic
It's automatic to spit
I gotta have it
Check me out
I'm so aristocratic and diplomatic
Peep the vocab laced with lyrical tactic
Soft spoken but my skills so emphatic
Emphasized and enigmatic
Synced with spans of attention
To grab it
I nabbed it and dabbed it
With a little bit of this, little bit of that
Put some cash in the hat and then I'll be back
Bump heroin, crack, xanax, and vicodin
Coveting for rhymes is like lungs harking for oxygen
My lyrical skills never possess the norm'
Like a neptune
Steady possessin' earth swallowing storms
Are you informed?
If not, then watch as I perform
When I reform this rap game and you can't conform just know..

Hook:
It's like this
And like that
And this and um...
It's like that
And like this
And like that and um...
It's like this
And like that
And like this and um...
It's like this
And like thatttt...

Last Verse:
I hit the mic with magic
No matter if you're Black, Asian, Hispanic, or Anglo Saxon
I'm Jazz the mic assassin
It's all good
It's all solid
All wood
You like my rhymes I know you would
