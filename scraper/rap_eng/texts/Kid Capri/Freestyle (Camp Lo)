[Suede]
Uh, Uh
We stay dressed
To impress
Spark the ladies interest
Sess to get them undressed
Once they wet
Get em back to the rest

Yo, I Suede
With black green Benz
And C-change
See dames in my vortex
From far range
Long chains
With Low hats
Cats with mink scarves
You squink
While I squeeze each of my thoughts off
Fresh, yes
Like I never been
Both the Lo
Know the direction you're headed in
Want to spend yen?
Drink gin my friend?
Gotta be in the shit that my crooks be in
From the front to the back
And it's so outta place
Gotta break off the cake
And break Capri off a taste

[Cheeba]
Me Cheeba
In green rag
On green jag
Might brag
While I breeze passed
His volkswag
Straight Hook
Back on coast ride
At Six Flags
Has stacked
From Green Bag and me sag
Fresh like I never be
Both the Lo
Know the direction you headed in
See my grin
From four kegs of gin
Gotta be in the shit that my chicks be in
From the right to left
On a slow kinda joint
Soundtrack to the Streets
Do you get the point?

[Suede]
Uh, Uh
We stay dressed
To impress
Spark the ladies interest
Sess to get them undressed
Once they wet
Get em back to the rest
They know...
