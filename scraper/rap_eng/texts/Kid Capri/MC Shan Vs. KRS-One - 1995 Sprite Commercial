[Kid Capri]
Alright fellas
No rhyming below the belt

[MC Shan]
"Whoop, whoop" Sound the alarm
And the booga-booga-bricks set spikes the bomb
Blowing up the spot like I was nitroglycerin
And who's supposed to knock me out persist? Kris?

[KRS-One]
KRS-One comes with strike two
When Shan is through
Second strike Shansies, triple Sprites
Within his eyesight
And strike three, lyrical verse disperse
To obey your thirst
