Ahhhhhhh yeah... without a doubt!

And I'm in the house with Foxy Brown
For the nine-pound, plus one
And we got things goin on, in a big way in here

So what we gon' do right now is want you to get involved
In what's about to happen, yo drop that Foxy

[Foxy Brown]
I'm Don like Perignon, peep me
Continously to (take money) indeed
They keep frontin my Firm'll keep sumpin
Fox uh-oh, freak sumpin
B-12 Coupes flossin, high-post, off me
Killin em softly, like Fugees
My lah be straight cheddar, in K sweater
Them pussies fuck dicks, raw dog shit
Bubblin mad chips, hard in the six
Where we at (BROOKLYN!) uhh and you know that
Niggas'll get dismissed so peep this

How that dick be all that, he blowin backs out
Please, I was in the drop three it was D
And his man from D.C. on some straight P.D

[Foxy Brown]
You know the Na Na is all that
That's why I get briquettes, and lazarus, and all that
In fact, my sex games, all that
Cause when I do my thing, no turnin back
Bet that, I be stashin in C-10
Chrome Lauren, shittin hard in the Benz
Morocco bremen, niggas scheamin
Shoulda seen em, 850 y'all be men
Gettin his wild on, frontin at the bar
Guzzlin that low, kiko (who he tryin to style on?)
Courvosier sipper, all day
He was ballin, sway while the beat is 360 ways
Anyway, I continues to floss
Iceberg shit on the ass of course
That's how we plays, high-post all day
Come round my way, see a true player play
Fox Boogie, straight ballin all day
You know how I do nigga, Firm way, hey

[Foxy Brown]
When it come to niggas I'm game tight, game alright
High-post, I plays, the frame all night
Alright, life's ill, push twenty mil
Easy, unplugged, fucks with, only thugs
Pretty niggas too but I'm, seein you, uhh

Strokin the Na Na is like cocoa
Bitches a dime go loco for that flow doe
Shit, it's dangerous, peep the wrist, uhh
Explain this, rocks all crisp
Chicks fuckin for nuttin, please mama
Betta get that cheese, villainese, on her knees
Tell her fuck the mink, she want a persian Land
Frontin, from where he talkin cribs then he sayin sumpim
Sexual status, we's the baddest
Girls, we got the weapons, niggas, got to have this
Pure shan Don frontin, to start sumpin
He buggin, lustin over nuttin, cause I'm gone

*second chorus with slight variations*

[Kid Capri]
