[Biz Markie]
But bust this though everybody
Yo, we havin a party, a LORD's party
A party for the Lords, the Lords with the party thing
All of a sudden, people got shot
The rope runner was standin, right by, the other side of
They ate barbecued peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
(GET OFF THE STAGE BIZ!)
Why don't you just chill bah bah, road hog, kang-ka-dang

[Kid Capri]
Party time people, ain't nuttin movin but your feet
Gotta get up on out your seat
Come on down with the Lords, get ready to get busy
Knahmsayin?  Ain't no party like this party nowhere near this party
So this must be the party
So get up on the floor, and get it goin on, right about now

[Verse One]
It's a party, I'm invitin everybody
Cuties, hookers and hotties
To come to the bash for free
Your hosts: Capri, Mark, D
Everybody up no time to waste
You came here cause you know this is the place
To rock, act like a fool
It's the Lords and we goin right back to the booth!

Now you know the flavor New York
Ain't no sense in bein shy, tryin to play fly
Be yourself never mind the next guy
This is a party we gonna get busy whether you like it or not
Throw on the funk wanna make sure, that you havin a good time
Now stop actin like a baby, and get on the floor

[Verse Two]
Oh man I really like the way this is goin down
Lords, came to your town
Made you a fiend like a crackhead (a crackhead?)
That's right, you heard what I said
Party time in the Boogie Down, ready for some action
Show me just a little satisfaction
Dance, and shake
It's time to start a Boogie Down earthquake
Kick a party groove is like a habit
See a fat booty then you grab it
Maybe wanna slide to the side (slide to the side)
Keep the drummer kickin let the beat ride
It's funny how we make a body move
Stay in step, just keep it to the right groove
Party, don't be a coward
Show me whatcha gonna do about it!

Uhh!  ..  Uhh!  ..  Uhh!
Now y'all do me a favor, let me see you do
Do the bend, and stretch
Do the bend, and the stretch
Let me see you do the bend, and stretch
C'mon and do the bend, and stretch
Let me see you do the bend, and stretch
C'mon and do the bend, and stretch
Do the bend, and stretch
Lords of Funk in full effect, word!

[Verse Three]
Party time in the Boogie Down Bronx..
.. time to give the people what they want
To make me wanna know you wanna get down I gotta see you dance
Gotta take a chance
Capri, known for abilities, tactics
And all of my fast rap agility
Made to perform and I strike like lightning, scary?
Yes it's quite frightening, huh!

Uhh!  ..  Uhh!  ..  Hoe, uhh!  ..  Woo!

[Verse Four]
I got a message, to Money Mark
Remember when we rocked in the park?
Remember that girl Joanna (Joanna?)
Body was pumpin like a scanner
Remember when we rocked that body
It always happens when you're comin to a Lord's party
She tried you, she tried me
Then left the party with who?  Silver D
Here's another girl Michelle
Looks good and she dance really well
Eighteen years old, neck full of gold
The girl even dances the old, school
Talk about she make a cold heart beat
Still remember, seein her feet
Dance to the rhythm of the drum
Dum diddy diddy dum dum!

Now what I want everybody to do
Is put their right hand in the air like this
Shake 'em side to side
Everybody c'mon, put your hands in the air lemme see lemme see ya
Go left (left) to the right (right)
To the left (left) to the right (right)
To the left (left) to the right (right)
To the left (left) now let's do this c'mon
Everybody do the bend, and stretch
C'mon and do the bend, and the stretch
Let me see you do the bend, and stretch
C'mon and do the bend, and stretch
We go, side to side, keep it goin c'mon
Go side to side, keep it goin
Follow up and do the bend, and stretch
Do the bend, and stretch, HUH!

Ahh yes so now you know what we mean and you see for yourself
We ain't got no time for SISSIES
We came here to party, word to Big Bird!
Lord's of Funk bout ready to take two steps to the rear
And get on out of here like last year
But before we go, everybody hands up, c'mon

Shake it to the left.. to the right, c'mon
Shake it to the left.. to the right
Shake it to the left.. to the right
Shake it to the left.. to the right, but stretch
