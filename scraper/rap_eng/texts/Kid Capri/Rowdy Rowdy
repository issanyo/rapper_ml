Yo LA niggas are the rowdy niggas
New Orleans niggas is rowdy nigga
D.C. niggas is some rowdy niggas
New York Niggas is the fucking wildest nigga

[Verse One]
Yo, your man could have ran when I robbed him but he froze
Son I ain't even rock him to sleep, the nigga dozed
The bitch could have helped you get rich, but she chose
Now you heartbroke, that's what you get for lovin them hoes
An ill flow with no beat, is incomplete, it's like a stickup kid
Runnin round without no heat, it like a fifth with no kick
A fiend with no hit, a willie with no wit
A bad bitch that won't blow dick
It's like a rollie with no ice, a gamblin spot with no dice
Like fuckin supermodel bitches and not bustin off twice
I murda any mic device, for the right price, I'm nice
I only say things once, never twice, dont fuck with me

[Hook]
St. Louis niggas is rowdy rowdy
Cleveland niggas is bout it bout it
50 cent ain't gonna kill ya nigga, don't get doubted
Got your gun, well don't leave home without it
Them Memphis ballas is rowdy rowdy
Them [Chi]-town cats is bout it bout it
They'll kill you and act like they don't know shit about it
Leave your body somewhere where no one can find it

[Verse Two]
Now if I pull out the gat and just push your wig back
I bet niggas will stand around sayin "Damn who did that?"
I'm the type nigga to dare you to touch the [Jack]
I'm the type to borrow your gat and won't give the shit back
I'm F to the I - F -T - Y - C - E - N - T
Caress your girl gently in back of the Bentley
You thought she was pimpin, son I was in the Hamptons
In a heart shaped hot tub with the bitch lampin
I plan to take over New York and start expandin
Was Bob Marley singin about tecs when he sung "I'm Jammin'"
Nigga fuck with my cash and I'mma blast yo' ass
Smash the Glock out the stash in the dash an [mash]
Flee in a flash, lay low let time go past
If you survive the shots I'mma find yo' ass
Put the gat to your head and remind your ass
I ain't playin with you, I want my money motherfucker

[Hook]
The VA cats is rowdy rowdy

Them ballas out in Philly is rowdy rowdy
Them Oakland cats is rowdy rowdy
They'll body you and act like they know nothing about it

[Verse Three]
Yo, some nigga just shot the block up, god (Word?)
He had the same shit you got on, dog (Word?)
I know you done did it so get the fuck up outta hear, ya heard?
I run with niggas that spray and strip and say that shit
You won't let us pump on your block, fuck it, we makin it hot
I'm that nigga that call the shots, with the iced out watch
From the cordless cell phone, and the baby blue drop
I got a lot of hungry niggas with me straight from the street
These industry cats are startin to look like something to eat
They got watches on they wrist that cost like 60 thousand
My niggas live in section eight in public housing
They murder you and keep shit low cause niggas heard of you

Leave your body somewhere where no nobody can find it

Them Jersey cats is rowdy rowdy
Them Boston ballas is rowdy rowdy
If they say they gon' wet you boy, don't you doubt it
Got your gun, well don't leave home without it
