[Intro/Hook: Heavy D, (Vinia Mojica)] (3x)
I got nothing but love for you, baby (Uh-huh)
I got nothing but love for you, honey
(Yeah, whatever)
I got nothing but love for you, baby
(What you got?)
I got nothing but love for you, honey
(Yeah, whatever)

What's yours is mine
What's mine is mine
What's yours is mine
What's mine is mine
What's yours is mine
What's mine is mine

[Verse 1: Heavy D]
I know you want lots a jewels and stuff
Backyards with swimming pools, bars with stools and stuff
Fancy foods - Lobster, Sushi
Gear - Versace, Gucci, crazy Lucci
I know your M.O., you do demo on a paycheck
You get a Herb from 'burb and show him no respect
Middle name "Price Tag," first name "Gotcha"
Started slow, got on a roll, now they can't stop you
Talking about "Hey Boo, how you do?"
Some clown uptown said you ran through his crew
I give you props and ya credit cause it's due
But I ain't that clown, and my crew ain't that crew
Time's too hard to be faking like I'm dating on some steak
And...wining and dining, I ain't choking on no chicken
Leave it up to me I'll close the whole damn store on you
I got nothing but love for you

[Hook]
I got nothing but love for you, baby (Uh-huh)
I got nothing but love for you, honey
(Yeah, whatever)
I got nothing but love for you, baby
(What you got?)
I got nothing but love for you, honey
(Yeah, whatever)

[Verse 2: Heavy D]
I'm not your H-E-R-B, but I'm your H-E-A-V-Y dash-D
Don't test me, don't ask me for nothing
For nathan, for jack, for doodly-squat, you can do me not
You plan on plot on who be hot and trying to hit the slot
I know your low pro style, your low (whole/ho) profile
Kick a bother in the gut and then you smile
I must admit; I really dig your operation
Every time we on the phone, you got the sexy conversation
So now you hope to be the woman of my dream
And while I'm sleeping, you'll be creeping, robbing me clean
I see you hanging on the corners with the rest of your girl crew
Standing by the gutter with your booty cutters
So who's the honey dip, down with the money grip
Always got a plan and a scam to get some money quick
Always gettin' with the next man, the one with the checks
And setting up a trap with the sexing

[Hook]
I got nothing but love for you, baby (Uh-huh)
I got nothing but love for you, honey
(Yeah, whatever)
I got nothing but love for you, baby
(What you got?)
I got nothing but love for you, honey
(Yeah, whatever)

[Heavy D]
So nobody dis the champion
So nobody dis the champion

[Verse 3: Heavy D]
You give me feelings like I'm dealing with a crooked hand
You got a grand from a man cause you shook his hand
You're well known in the streets, in the gutters
So fly, when you caught my eye, you made me stutter
You come around with your curls and your pretty pearls
You even been around the world, so you go, girl
But where's the love at
Tell me where's the hugs at
Acting like a Rugrat
I know where you bought that
Don't try to gas me, girl, I know the streets well
You're money hungry
And you're making trick-n-treats sell
So leave it up to me
I'll close the whole damn store on you
I got nothing but love for you

[Hook - until fade]
I got nothing but love for you, baby (Uh-huh)
I got nothing but love for you, honey
(Yeah, whatever)
I got nothing but love for you, baby
(What you got?)
I got nothing but love for you, honey
(Yeah, whatever)
