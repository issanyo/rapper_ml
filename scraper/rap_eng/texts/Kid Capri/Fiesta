Uh-huh uh-huh, TrackMasters

[Kid Capri]
Uhh, uncontrollable hotness on this plate
From state to state, it's Noreaga the great
I'm the Kid Capri, y'all DJ niggas, play this shit twice
Yo Nore, tell the story!

[Noreaga]
Yo, yo, yo, aiyyo chicken I knew, her man named Taboo
Friend named Gina, we used to call her Buck-weeda
Always come around and just roll reefer
We used to tell her to stop, but she won't either
Her nigga Que said he'd fuck her but he won't eat her
Chicken I knew came through, and boned Peter
Buck-weeda got the word ya heard? I don't know how
Whoever went and told gotta be so foul
So much, playa hatin gotta change the style
Niggas wanna go and tell about a doggystyle
Buck-weeda called me up on the phone
Said she ain't really mad cause she fucked 'Pone
Now she on some other shit, wanna bone Tone
Player like E.T. wanna phone home
Crazily I zone, shorty gotta call me back when she grown
What?

[Kid Capri]

[Noreaga]
Yo, yo let me set it off, show you how I'll break you off
N.O.R.E., so fuck y'all competitors
Either you a live chick, or a regular whore
Yo I knew this chick, used to rhyme and shit
I used to lie to her, tell her that I'd buy her shit
Yo a crib, the diamonds, plus a whip
Yo I went to the crib, to put it on
Aiyyo, and on the real, woulda put her on
But even when I wrote it, yo the bitch couldn't quote it
I found it real foul, like she demoted
One thing she could do though, is deep throat it
But I kept it real, bitch still ain't got a record deal
Mention my name, keep it simple and plain
She was, off the meter when she seen wood grain
Told the bitch maintain, now we do the same
Or we can hit the telly up, you can give me some brain
What?

[Kid Capri]

[Noreaga]
Yo, to all the bitches, never gave a nigga pussy
Aiyyo this one's for y'all, I make one for y'all
Dedicated, hatin me, gang related
Either I turned you off, asked you to suck my dick
Or I felt your tits and came off too quick
Tried to fuck on the first night, called you a bitch
And I'm a thug nigga, so I don't bite my tongue
And I ain't choosy, yo I take a bitch how she come
You could be a doodoo head boo, and still have fun
But you know bitches, they wanna act all ill
Actin like they really real cause they fuckin squeal
Said she know Jay-Z, and she know Shaquille
Chicken add me to the list, so what's the deal?
Want a nigga waitin long, I'm off later
She be callin me up, askin 'Noreaga?'
Yo whattup, fuck the talkin let's just fuck
"Yo I like the song where you say what-what"
Hang up, call me back when you bout some butt
What?
