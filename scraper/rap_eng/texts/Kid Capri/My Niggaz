Yeah
Uhhh

[Foxy]
Ayo fo real
It's time for everybody
To get they muthafuckin' minds right
Cause it's about to go down
Straight like that
Oooh
Uhhh
Kid Capri
Ill Na Na
And the muthafuckin' L-O-X
That's right

Chorus (Styles)

From the top of New York, where they be poppin' they corks
From the bottom of the slums, where they be poppin' they guns
Niggas that rock whips and get plenty of one's
But niggas goin' hand and hand, are havin' to run
The niggas that had cake and got sent up state
For the mother who lost a child and had to set up a wake
For those who swan about the ghetto, but don't know how to skate
Guess you gotta live the life just keep the faith

[Sheek]
Aye yo, aye yo
Our shit contagious, so ya'll niggas try to quaratine us
Ya'll niggas shook up, and all that like Orangina's
My gun American, but my niggas got foreign nina's
Six cars between us, laced out
Half my money from the drug route, ya know how that goes
We hung in heavy metal clubs, and slung shit for the nose
It's Sheek Luchion, either at the bar with a groupie on
My python, gettin' sex
In hotels with connected the rooms
Fill letter walk through on his ex
Jadakiss and Styles smoke a pound up through a storm
Room service, bring 'em champagne with five matts on
From most hated, to heavy rotated, forget it
Next stop is movies, ya'll check it when Blockbuster get it
Cheap-skates, sweatin' off Capri's pre-release dates
For Money, Power & Respect, went platnuim out the gates
From Rusell Simmons to Puff, Lox and DMX got this
Big time, we probably shoot this joint up on tropics
When we eat fish like whiteies
And bitches have on nighties
Suckin' dick, me I'm on some jail shit
Standing up, jerkin' off, while these hoes eat each others clits
(Yuh heard me)

Chorus (Styles)

From the top of New York, where they be poppin' they corks
From the bottom of the slums, where they be poppin' they guns
Niggas that rock whips and get plenty of one's
But niggas goin' hand and hand, are havin' to run
The niggas that had cake and got sent up state
For the mother who lost a child and had to set up a wake
For those who swan about the ghetto, but don't know how to skate
Guess you gotta live the life just keep the faith

[Foxy Brown]
Uhh, uhh
Bet I salute all chicks that be gettin' them chips
Throw it up, for my bitches, that be poppin' that Crist'
Specially to the one's, who be ridin' that dick
And if the pussy bangin', hope it cop to a stick
And all my thorough chicks, who cried and lied for these cats
Out of town, on a hound for these cats
If shit got thick, let off rounds for these cats
In the crocodle Prada, stash the pound for these cats
Me and my bitches got down for these cats
Paid our dues, for 62's, taped to the thigh
Seen the truth through the lie, but the bullshit aside
Like a trooper, I put that on my life that I ride
Conspiracy charge, straight copped out to 3-5
What fuck am I to do, suffer and die
Maximum 25, baby fuck if I fry
It's a ditry game, when it come to slingin' them thangs
Bail like a hundered-thou, but the us is more change
Shit, I used to trick that from jewels and the rings, huh

Chorus (Styles)

From the top of New York, where they be poppin' they corks
From the bottom of the slums, where they be poppin' they guns
Niggas that rock whips and get plenty of one's
But niggas goin' hand and hand, are havin' to run
The niggas that had cake and got sent up state
For the mother who lost a child and had to set up a wake
For those who swan about the ghetto, but don't know how to skate
Guess you gotta live the life just keep the faith

[Styles]
Prayer one, for niggas that be bustin' they gun
Till the death, what'd you expect for a couple of one's
Prayer two, for niggas that ain't ever had shit
Masked up, blacked down, go on and grab shit
Prayer three, for niggas on lock without a key
That ain't never comin' home, but you know how it be
Livin' to die, but niggas ain't willin' to die
If you bust up in the air, you ain't killin' the sky
Feelin' the high, nigga is you willin' to lie
You a crumb and you dumb, you ain't stealin' the pie
I leave a bloody mess, nigga bigger then me, cut his neck
Lox brothers, ya'll niggas is cock-suckers
Yellow belly cowards, I want Money and the Power
Assassin, you think it's a joke, you'll die laughing
Hoppin' out the plane, and only bringing the captain
Start of a legacy, her heart broke down and start beggin' me
Dog I'm a whole different pedigree
Take me to the limit, I'm layin' in the cut
While you playin' in the scrimage
Meet you at the final
Lyrically, I'm spiritually, drunker then a whino
Posion, house full of rhyme
Bring your boys in
Tell 'em take it easy, have a seat on the couch
I'm the govenor, ya'll bitch niggas is crouts
Take orders, yuh need passports at the border
We transporting water, shit was flawed
Fell sick took a hit, but we wasn't the cure
Make your ear-drums pop, bottom lip drop
Eyes switch up, knees hit the floor by the time he spits up
Nobody gets up

Muthafuckas
L-O-X muthafucka
L-O-X, try this shit

Chorus (with ad-libs)

From the top of New York, where they be poppin' they corks
From the bottom of the slums, where they be poppin' they guns
Niggas that rock whips and get plenty of one's
But niggas goin' hand and hand, are havin' to run
The niggas that had cake and got sent up state
For the mother who lost a child and had to set up a wake
For those who swan about the ghetto, but don't know how to skate
Guess you gotta live the life just keep the faith
