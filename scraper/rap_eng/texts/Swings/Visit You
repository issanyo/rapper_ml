[Verse 1 : Swings]
I live like a kid and life is a candy shop
And like my jams I've kinda been
Known to make them panties drop
Typically if I feel you then
I let you know that you're hot
I don't judge you for being
You honesty is hard to find
You can take me for a ride
And yes take your time to decide
Only imma do the same
And let you know what's on my mind
People need to keep it real
And rejection is not a crime
Anyways I just wanna chill
All seriousness aside
I make music mainly
With other endeavors on the side
I guess I could say business isn't bad
But then I aim high
So I hope to be a billionaire before I'm 55
Ambitious yes I am
And approach you with the same drive

[Pre-Hook : Swings]
You'd like to take your time girl
By all means nobody in a rush
I know you've heard of my world
We can text 'til you say I can come visit you
Can I come visit you?
Can I come visit you?
I wanna know what you do
And see if rumors is true
Can I come visit you?
Can I come visit you?
I wanna know what you do

[Hook : Swings]
I know you got a lot of things to do
Just wondering if I can come visit you
And we can talk about a thing or two
Keep it playful nothing too critical
I know you got a lot of things to do
Just wondering if I can come visit you
And we can talk about a thing or two
Keep it playful nothing too critical

[Verse 2 : Colde]
Okay 우린 90년대식 사랑의 열매 ye
난 뻔한 놈들 사이 싸여있지 베일에
일주일 뒤에 너의 방 문을 열 때
흘러나올 걸 내 노래 우린 매일 해
아크로바틱 같이 너무 유연해
대화를 주고받자 iphone처럼 뜨겁게
Baby we here in sixty nine
I'll do anything day n night
I fell in love with your thought
Girl I wanna know what you do
I never thought that love with you
너도 나를 쳐다보지 않았구
난리도 아니었던 party는 너 땜에 cool
넌 고양이처럼 내 옆을 just passin through
그랬던 우리의 줄다리긴 이제 끝
몇 주 뒤 이미 넌 내 품 어디쯤
I give you all that I got
I wanna do
Girl I give you all that I got
I wanna do

[Pre-Hook : Colde]
You'd like to take your time girl

Can I come visit you?
