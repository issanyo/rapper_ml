[Verse 1: Swings]
I give a fuck about what they do
I ain't you and life is painful
When you don't have friends to save you
That's why I take care of family business
I don't fuck average bitches
I only fuck with the best
I'm not impressed by these dick heads who settle for less
Grown men acting their age that get my respect
Cause if we gonna shine, we gon' shine together
Your gain is mine and you know I'm sharing
Mine it's never just me myself and I
I take care of them and I got that reputation
It's basic, I am a family guy
I damage outsiders who try to infiltrate
And we're not intimidated by these motherfuckers
You're my brother from another mother
As far as loyalty goes you are my brother's brother
So fuck everybody else they just fuck us over
No more new faces, let's go and run 'em over

[Hook: Kid Milli]
Family business, paper chase, paper chase
My family chasin' paper, paper chase
싸게 구해 비싸게 팔어, yah
하루 팔아 밤에 나눠, yah
Chasin' dream and chasin' won, chasin' what
Chasin' dream and chasin' cloth, chasin' what
Chasin' dream and chasin' yen, chasin' ticket
Boy, light in my wallet

[Verse 2: Kid Milli]
My brain's full of plan, boy
Don't give a fuck about what they do, I ain't you
Y'all rappers dance wit me, I got a gun in my throat, fool
쟤네 머리에 침 놔주는게 내 family business, bitch, I'm
Going straight to the top 내 moving groovy하게
So I'm undercover gang, 난 소문도 없이 달려
내게 보이는 모든 것이 돈이고 없는 너에게 콜하지 못해
Fuck these bunch of hoes, yeah, hoes be talkin' like
저 오빠 같은 rapper가 좋고 뭐고 F, I overdosed on
Money 또 난 모든 cloth, family business stackin' dough
Yen or Won, 난 뽑아 표 woke up in chuo ku
I wanna some masterpieces 이미 있지
What's the business ballin', spaldin', spendin'
For the glitch F your business
매일해 내 일 내 일은 daily 니 일은 내일해
But I'm braggin', braggin' 'bout 내 chainz and dresses
Racing track in Japan now I'm swithin' lane 내
몫은 내꺼 아직도 reppin black gang badass kid
Kid Milli gettin' fuckin better bitches u na mean
예의 차려야해 니가 나를 부를때면
Sacai is my kind of outfit
Color boost on my feet
어설픈 놈은 첨 봤지 이거
But they don't know bout it

[Hook: Kid Milli]
Family business, paper chase, paper chase

Chasin' dream and chasin' won, chasin' what
Chasin' dream and chasin' cloth, chasin' what
Chasin' dream and chasin' yen, chasin' ticket
