English Translation

[Verse 1]
All you kids pretending you have money, go away
Cuz I can hang your salary on my shoulder
I’m way too fly to be one of yall
You can’t even breathe in my position

Why should I sit with you?
I’ll send over a bottle, drink it with your hyungs
This unni is your unni, you’re a young boy
On your way back, call over the waiter for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I’m self made
Ain‘t no body ever made me
I’m in the party going crazy
This is like a movie

[Chorus]
And i feel like this is why
I feel like this is why yuh
I feel like this is why baby
I feel like this is why
I feel like this is why baby
I’m a bad motha’ ... in the room
I feel like this is why
I feel like this is why

[Verse 2]
I drive my own car, just get in next to me
There’s a lot to show you, let’s eat, I’m the food
All the way to the top, that’s my mission
Kiss my ass, competition

Why should I stick with you?
Wherever I go, I only get love
This unni is your unni, you’re a young boy
On your way back, call over the waiter for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I’m self made
Ain‘t no body ever made me
I’m in the party going crazy
This is like a movie

[Chorus]
And i feel like this is why
I feel like this is why yuh
I feel like this is why baby
I feel like this is why
I feel like this is why baby
I’m a bad motha’ ... in the room
I feel like this is why
I feel like this is why

[Bridge]
And i speak nothing but the truth
I’m me and you’re you
And i don‘t give a F-U-#-K
What you say about me
Got gangsta in my attitude
I always do what I want
And i don‘t give a F-U-#-k
What ya think

[Chorus]
And i feel like this is why
I feel like this is why yuh
I feel like this is why baby
I feel like this is why
I feel like this is why baby
I’m a bad motha’ ... in the room
I feel like this is why
I feel like this is why

[Outro]
This is why this is why this is why
This is why this is why this is why
This is why this is why this is why
This is why this is why this is why

I’m a bad motha
I feel like this is why
I feel like this is why, Baby

Hangul

[Verse 1]
돈 많은 척 하는 애들은 저리가
네 연봉을 내 어깨에다 거니까
I‘m way to fly to be one of yall
내 위치에선 넌 숨도 못 쉬어

내가 왜 굳이 너네랑 앉어
한 병 보낼게 형들이랑 마셔
이 언니 네 언니 넌 영보이
저 돌아가는 길에 저기 웨이터 불러줘

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause i'm self made
Ain‘t no body ever made me
I’m in the party going crazy
이건 거의 movie

[Chorus]
And i feel like 굳이
I feel like 굳이 yuh
I feel like 굳이 baby
I feel like 굳이
I feel like 굳이 baby
I’m a bad motha’ ... in the room
I feel like 굳이
I feel like 굳이

[Verse 2]
내 차는 내가 몰아 그냥 옆에 앉아
보여줄게 많아 저녁 먹자 내가 밥
맨 위에 맨 위로 그게 나의 미션
내 엉덩이에다 뽀뽀해라 컴퍼티션

내가 왜 굳이 너한테 붙어
어디가도 내가 받는 것은 오직 love
이 언니 네 언니 넌 영보이
저 돌아가는 길에 저기 웨이터 불러줘

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause i'm self made
Ain‘t no body ever made me
I’m in the party going crazy
이건 거의 movie

[Chorus]
And i feel like 굳이
I feel like 굳이 yuh
I feel like 굳이 baby
I feel like 굳이
I feel like 굳이 baby
I’m a bad motha’ ... in the room
I feel like 굳이
I feel like 굳이

[Bridge]
And i speak nothing but the truth
난 나야, 너도 너대로
And i don‘t give a F-U-#-K
What you say about me
Got gangsta in my attitude
내가 늘 원하는대로
And i don‘t give a F-U-#-K
What ya think

[Chorus]
And i feel like 굳이
I feel like 굳이 yuh
I feel like 굳이 baby
I feel like 굳이
I feel like 굳이 baby
I’m a bad motha’ ... in the room
I feel like 굳이
I feel like 굳이

[Outro]
굳이 굳이 굳이
굳이 굳이 굳이
굳이 굳이 굳이
굳이 굳이 굳이

I’m a bad motha
I feel like 굳이
I feel like 굳이 Baby
