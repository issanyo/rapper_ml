[ VERSE 1 ]
Think of women, think of men, now think of parties
Pretty faces, fresh bodies
Skirts and shirts, as tight as it can be
I don't know about you, but that's appealin to me
I'm providin this party with a little speech
Exclusively written for all the freaks
Grab a girl or guy, whatever you go for
I proceed this party till the a.m. tour
Open up the champagne, let's do this right
While the Trag and Fatal put your body in flight
So hey, take a chance with this handsome thing
I provide the rhyme to let the body swing
So dance, everybody, everybody get up
Drink the beer from the bottle, you don't need a cup
You came to have fun, so enjoy yourself
Take your problems off your back and leave em on the shelf
Hey, I'm a party animal, and so are you
So for all you party animals, this jam's for you

	Tragedy, he's the party animal

[ VERSE 2 ]
The party is smooth, I'm debonaire and outspoken
I never drive drunk, so I keep me a token
Just a short time ago you didn't know I exist
Now you see me hostin parties and you're blowin me a kiss
I sweep you off your feet with grace and ease
Cause a brother like Trag is what the party needs
Hurry up and buy my record, no matter what it's costin
Yo, I rock the party from around to Boston
So let the music soothe you, move your butt
Created by Fatal, but there is no cuts
Hey, he's a party animal, just like you
So for all the party animals, this jam's for you

	Tragedy, he's the party animal

[ VERSE 3 ]
Okay, a girl wants to meet you, but she's tryin to stall
Dance, move your body, get your butt off the wall
Proceed like a gentleman, don't insult her
Dance, move your body like John Travolta
But not too close, stop and think
Go to the bar, call her over and order a drink
And don't get shy when it comes to conversation
A sip of drink might boost your motivation
Follow instructions, you just might win
And who knows, if you're lucky, you may hit some skins
But if you don't, who cares, it doesn't matter
There's always somethin out there that's better and badder
A real party animal, waitin for you
So for all the party animals, this jam's for you
