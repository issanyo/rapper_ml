(feat. Craig G)

(I don't even remember how this happened)

(The Crew will not understand it)

(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)

(The Crew will not understand it)

[VERSE 1]
Yo, this jam is dedicated to you, boy, just listen
Take off your coat, get in a fit position
Cause I'm about to burn you at 450 Fahrenheit
You're jealous of the crew, that's why you're starin, right?
Forget the answer, the situation's obvious
When this is over, let's see who feels the sorriest
You'll be like, "Damn Craig, why did you play me, yo?"
And then you realize we're toppin rap radio
Cause it's no game, boy, you can't do work
Marley, please tell us his name (Duck Alert)

(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)

(Has your crew suddenly become interested in promoting a war?)

[VERSE 2]
Now our crew is broken down into a large amount of channels
And not one of us can you handle
On the mic Magic, on the tables Marley
And when it comes to bein dope, don't ask: are we?
Cos our style is different, or should I say irregular?
And if you wanna get all hype, I'll have to settle ya
By pullin out my 12-gauge shotgun
And if you wanna go rhyme for rhyme, I got some
Dope rhymes for sure, or should I say galore?
But I won't sound old-schoolish, in other words foolish
I have a question now: who feels hurt?
Marley, do you have the answer? (Duck Alert)
Thank (yee-ee-aah)

(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)

(What happened between us, was for us alone)

(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)

(I am speaking to you from the Bridge)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Yeeeeeeh)

[VERSE 3]
After this, I hope you get someone to battle me
But make sure this person has originality
That's right, original, yeah, you heard me
I don't want his beats soundin like Hurby's
Oops - I mean Marley, cause Hurb's a beat-biter
I don't know where the both of you get the right to
Come in the industry, steal someone's property
And some of you, forbid, start clocking's
Now that's not fair, Marley's the rightful owner
Yet you still treat him like he's a blood-doner
So now it's time to have revenge to all you jerks
Especially who, Marley? (Duck Alert)
That's right

(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)

(I am speaking to you from the Bridge)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)

(You're from where?)

[VERSE 4]
Ehm - at the final stage, cut the scratches
Marley Marl? I think no one can match his
Cuttin ability on the 1200s
And many listeners, they often wonder
(Yo man, was that a tape?!) Nah, never in a milion years
You see, the liveness gives us the feelin we're
Bein accepted as true entertainers
And it will stay that way for the remainder
Of the century, that's how it's meant to be
You don't believe me? You will eventually
Because the situation, boy, you can't divert
Escpecially who, Marley? (Duck Alert)
Ah-ha

(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)

(Eat your ass up)
(I don't even remember how this happened)
(Eat your ass up like a steak ???)
(The Crew will not understand it)
(Eat your ass up like a steak ???)
(The Crew will not understand it)
(Eat your ass up like a steak ???)
(Has your crew suddenly become interesed in promoting a war?)
