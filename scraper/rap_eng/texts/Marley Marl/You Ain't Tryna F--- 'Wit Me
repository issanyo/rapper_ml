[Verse 1: Nitemare]
Now I'm not the average white kid in this street life guard
I'm trying to beat the trife odds I've yesterday's past in ash
No future it was simple mathematics
I wouldn't last unless I statched some cash
I visualized suicide and hard times reflected off my mind
Like the sun's equilibrium when expressing these rhymes
13 was a thug fiend with drugs girls used to dig me now
It's obscene no love confused lost to find reality
I'm day dreaming of fanisty's and having wishes
For christany with hopes
I prey to god
I awoke not to be broke feeding my family
Still they don't understand me responsable now
I'm making money that I never thought was possible
Regretting about my grandpa who was in the hospital
Before I never cared cylcelogical
When I dropped out of high school only cared about hotties
And fast cars lesson you can't have sucessed man
When your ass is poor I can't wait for it I want it all fast
As a labor door slamming like Outkast with Caddlac
Doors austic used to get caught up with the wrong kids
Selling narcotics made me violent and born sick
I gotta maintain because stress on the brain
Can led to a mother fucking suicide thang
I think the whole worlds going insane
I fill my self up with liquor and drink away the pain

[Verse 2: Tomb]
When I was young I ran buckwild in the streets
Troublesome first learning juvenile techniques
I wanted to look nice
But I was scared and broke drug dealing
I used to borrow clothes
After I paid dollars to smoke me and my friends hung out
At the park seshing getting high and dipped
When it got dark cops watched the area
I seen some disappear arrested living in fear
Come and go others still sticking near what up son
It been quite a while we used to chill rap in the smoke pit
That was the lifestyle I had dreams of us making it
Famous but then you got incarcerated just know
I'd have your back never faking the funk
Since you ain't here things been fucked up
It's so hard to say goodbye a sad song and damn
I can't believe my man Jackson's gone
So I can't build mad long because it feels wrong
But I love you like a brother stand strong
I dedicate this to make the figure right
I'm a rep you to death so it's Jidda for life K Kronix
The friend I always been nice to besides you
Kept me out of trouble in high school
Where kids used to make fun of me in my face
For being in special ed because I knew i had it
Made I'm tired of backstabbing friends
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of never having no ends to pay for my health
Just like Won Aze said I gotta stay to myself
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead
Gone keep my brain on the game head strong

[Verse 3: Stalker]
Man I got evidence and I've been clever
Ever since my moms wanted me going to school
But development arrested by the government
Just some young kids struggling living life got me
Wondering new shit I'm discovering yo son I can't comfort
And sleep situations gone deep while others creep
Cause rich niggas hate to see a poor motherfucker eat
These streets are way colder than the polar
I'm always high I can't remain sober to maintain over
Clean bullied never being normal seen I was only 14
When in high school grade a average but skipping classes chilling with the boys I'm a savage
Having no advantage to make it ain't ready for static
And semi automatics they made me fully addicted robbing
For cash shit I got's to have it cause to much of something
Can make you an addict making mines counting cream
To shine off the dream but I know I'm a ether end up
Dead or in jail committing crimes so you ether in it
For money or you wasting time
Listen this my motherfucking life I'm spitting
