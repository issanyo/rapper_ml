Yo, Listen to me
Young thug this is some advice
You do a snake you be payin' the price
Catch you at the dice game
Blow you out the frame
Crack cheater, cause my niggas is grimy
All we really luv is reffer
Iraq, the name alone got you shook back on the island
You got ya man hood took
But turn around when you walk through
Guns are hawk you, already took ya shit
No matter who you talk too
The 6 berra no take no deniro
No heat East Elmhurst, Haiser Street
You feel the fury when you want that bust, Handcuff
Wishing that you ain't locked up
Now you get tested, Jake tell you when you get arrested
When you get there don't get molested
Yo call the C.O. that won't be necessary
They watch ya beat ya down and take ya conversary
My adversary donaldly dick, dynasty rich
My whole cliq got paid lawyers and rips
Gettin' locked up, fell down, no time for this
Aw, aw, when the gaged got caught in the car
Start the law, not trying to be a Cold Craft Star
Yo, you might be illin', you might be wildin'
But you won't be smilin' on Rikers Island
Rikers Island, Iraq

Juveniles get shook and see 74
Mobb 2 ice grill when you walk through
Come through a fly cached tested for that
See where your heart at
That fly shit niggas want that
Jerk on ya phone time
Sweet niggas get robbed blind
Robbed for ya watch, robbed for ya shine
You better fake regimen
Them niggas do alot of dead and let'em see ya sweatin'
And get PCed out protection
The by shit cause cliqs sent renim
And have you cut up if you don't pay up
Crips and Bloods all along with the Caves too
Business as usually, a bunch of criminals
Typical shit is critical, on a via a nigga rippin' you
A daily ritual, jail talk is pitiful
Not for every individual
I'm wit it and I won't go back
Niggas mad cause I keep a stack
And don't talk crip nigga, word up

See 74 adolescents now walk put ya hand to the floor
Ya hear nigga gettin' tall holey blaze galore
Tricks or ya fucking jaw to ya draw
See yo when I close watching you pour
How do you claws or how do I laws from taking yours
Contemplated or taking you down from at the door
Niggas with cause leave you wit scars and open source
Soon as ya boor get a swore stuck in ya faloor
Sharpin' up 1 son and become quick draw mcgraw
Put up ya paws boors go why I saw the cause
Cause livin' shiesty could be pricely
Niggas kidnappin' wify's while hearts cold as Italian Icy's
Now buck and a half slide across his face lace some nicely
You gottin' fiesty but where you stand is where the ice be
Forever your life be gone in the wind
Punching holes all in your abdomen
When the thug cats come with the stabbin'in the jury grabbin'in
Look out son they body slabbin'in while you was blabbin'in
Now know what the fuck is happenin'
