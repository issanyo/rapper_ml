I was at a jam the other night
I was feelin' real good so the feelin' was right
I came to the party for a different kinda action
The next thing I know I was doin' the Michael Jackson

I was thrown off beat and my feet got tired
The Sucker DJ just oughta be fired
He was clippin' and a-slippin', even tried back cuein'
The Sucker DJ didn't know what he was doin'

Then I said to my girls "This ain't the place to be"
Half the fellas only came 'cause the ladies were free
So we left the place before the next cut was played
My girl said to me, "I'm glad we never paid"
So I called Marley Marl on the very next day
Then we cut a rap about the Sucker DJs

See, to be a DJ you gotta do your best
Have you're own kinda style, not like the rest
No jumpin' up and down, spinnin' with your feet
'Cause the music that you play has to be on beat

So Marley Marl went down to take a test
To see who could cut up music best
They were all lined up and ready to spin
You could see in their faces that they wanted to win

Yes Marley took a test to become a DJ
He cut the music, went a-somethin' this way
He cut the music with so much class
Them Sucker DJs was a bust on their ass

So when the time was up, they just couldn't' believe
What the man Marley Marl has just achieved
To get the people dancin' on the wackiest jam
Cause Marley Marl is one hell of a man
So to those DJ's that think you're the greatest
Just stop look and listen cause you haven't heard the lastest

So just listen party people while I got your attention
There's a few more things I'd like to mention
My name is Crystal but they call me Dimples D
Ain't a female in the world could rap like me

I got big brown eyes, holes in my cheeks
Hypnotizin' rap every time I speak
Yeah I can make you fall in love if you give me a chance
I ain't talkin' 'bout sex or no kinda romance

But it's my style, my charm, let me go on
It's how chilly I can be when it starts to get warm
Now I'm five foot five, stayin' alive
In this world Dimples D will sure 'nough survive

With the robbers, the stealers, the cocaine dealers
The rapers, the stabbers, the pocketbook grabbers
The laughin', the cryin', the livin' and the dyin'
You're hired then fired, we're all gettin' tired
The workin', the foolin' when the other man is rulin'
The pushers, the users, the drug abusers
The killings, the feelin', when takin' penicillin
But I will survive, yeah, I will survive
Hey, I will survive 'cause I'm always chillin'
And ready and willin' to rock for y'all

Now this is just a little advice for you ladies in the house
I'ma tell you what the fellas are all about
They're like children playin' when you are producin'
They're out there lovin' other women
Oh can ya dig? Ain't that a blip!
And this is how they're gonna make their livin'
Men are known as multipliers
They're also known as the biggest liars
They'll soup you up and say "I'll be your man"
Until you end in a hotel as a one night stand
"The feeling's good" you might say to yourself
You turn around they're lovin' somebody else
Say three months later a belly shows
Then you try to figure out which way to go
Well if I have this baby will he return?
A-let me tell you, baby doll, you've just been burned
You see, a daddy is a boy that brags about his kid
A father is a man who supports and gives
A kid a home where she shall live
A-Dimples D ain't poppin' no bullshit
You see, they hit and run and after they're done
Your best friend'll be their number one
So don't let 'em get slick, play no games
You tell 'em Joe Neckbone is not your name
Now this is Dimples D signin' off my friend
But you can best believe I'll be back again
