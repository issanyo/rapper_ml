Yo it's like, it's like
Way back as the 60's came through
It was a little rock 'n roll era
Little R&B era came through
Know what I'm saying?
The 70's created a little disco era
So, you now it was time for a change
And that's when
Like the end of the 80's that's when hip hop came through
You know
Now that's when it made its mark
And then from there on
This went on into the 90's
Hip hop still prevailed
Now we're here in the 2000's
Hip hop is prevailing for like thirty joints
You know
Its like a lot of things change and move on
But we're just building stronger
It's like a snowball coming down the mountain
It's like getting bigger faster
Bigger, faster
Bigger, faster
Bigger, faster
Bigger, faster
Bigger, faster
Bigger, faster
And then blaw!
Hahaha
Hip hop
