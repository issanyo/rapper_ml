Woke up one morning, turned your radio on
Couldn't find your money and your brother was gone
Ya ran to the kitchen all you found was a bone
You knew your brother's habit couldn't ? on his own
Used for ten years and now he's grown
Lost his wife and lost his friends
The way he started is the way he'll end
Using cocaine again and again
Right one morning driving in his car
Smoke some dust this time he went too far
Flew off the cliff, right over the side
It was his first car, and his last ride
Now you wonder why he didn't quit
But I'll tell you the answer that coke is it
His life was in hang, he couldn't get through
I told you before that he shouldn't do it

(Don't do it!)

Now your mother's upset, there's only two sons left
You say that's something you could never do
But now your brother's crime ? rubbed off on you
Getting all high, acting all cool
Ya younger brother's don't even finish school
Taking care of your mother and your sister too
He chose his own way, he took his own fate
He used to idolize you but now it's hate
He tried to help you can't say that's it
He tried to put you in a ? and you caught a fit
And now you realize that hope is dead
Your life is in hang, you couldn't get throw it
I told you before that you shouldn't do it

(Don't do it!)

The tragedy, won't happen to me
Now your brother is in brain surgery
Yes, your brother's rich, he's a millionaire
While you're out in the Bronx and you're on welfare
Jealous of your brother all you do is cry
? even recommend suicide
Now your brother blames yourself for what you have done
As you know three minus two equals one
You can say your mother's life was a gambling bet
Cause she started out with three, now she only got one left
You think you're cool, a Casanova
But now your life is (all over!)

(cutting and scratching) (until the end)

(Hey!) (The tragedy!) (8x)

(Jealous of your brother!) (repeated)

(Jealous of your brother all you do is cry!) (repeated)

(First car!) (repeated)
