[Verse 1]
Sittin' in my room with my smokin' jacket on
The fireplace is burning and the girly is WARM
Time to make my move, so gently I kiss her
Whisper in her ear, and tell her that I miss her
She might try to pop that boyfriend junk
But I don't really care because I know he's a punk
I'll stomp him like a roach if he tries to approach
He can't get close cause I'm the one who wrote
The Book of Romance, so come on take a chance
You don't need a long look, all you need is a glance
If you wanna get warm, in my arms you belong
You have a problem, Hev will solve 'em, nothin' can go wrong - when

[Chorus]
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House

[Verse 2]
You said I couldn't do it, then it got done
And after you and I did it, you said it was fun
Now every day of your life you wanna be with me
When you got time to spend you spend time with Heavy D
I notice that you hold me gentle as a rose
I'm rough and tough baby, but then I suppose
That I had to be held in order to start holdin'
I think I got you hittin', so let's start rollin'

[Chorus]
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House

[Verse 3]
Heaven sent on our trip, champagne we sip
You look at me I look at you, then we touch lips
We roll around in the sand, later on hold hands
Walk by the beach and I can teach ya Heavy D's game plan
See the way that I am, is the Big Loverman
Check out the rhyme and in due time you'll be a Hev D fan
I'm swift you know, an Overweight Romeo
Come get a piece of the beast, because it's good to go
Emcee Heavy D all ladies I'm hookin'
Big extra love but STILL good lookin'
For you and I to swing on our romance free
All you gotta do is lean on me, because

[Chorus]
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House

[Verse 4]
I'm an overweight lover, entertainer of many
Now when I do a party now I may not do plenty
Girls out the crowd seem to go berserk
They start yellin' and screamin' "HEAVY D GO TO WORK"
And when I'm through rockin' and chillin' at the disco
They grab me up and scoop me up, they just won't let go
That's when I know that there's been too much charmin'
I put 'em in a line and say "Please don't squeeze the Charmin'"

[Chorus]
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
