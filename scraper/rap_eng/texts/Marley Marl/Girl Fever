Girls

Yo sweetheart, let me talk to you for just a second
Let me say to you somethin real quick, sweetheart
( *car speeding off* )
Yo sweetheart, would you like...
Yo, she got a convertable Benz, yo
[ Marley Marl ] Yo, yo Craig, you buggin, man
Yo, let's make jam, but we're not talkin bout Benz
What?
Girls
Girls? Alright...

[ VERSE 1 ]
Girls, I like em fat, I like em tall
Oh what the hell, I like em all
No matter where they are, no matter where they're at
Whether they're Spanish (Chinese) white or black
Me and girls get along so very well
A man needs a woman in this world to excel
And there's a whole lot of em, from every city
]From London to France, Japan to Chili
God made man, and God made woman
To fulfill the needs another man couldn't
So if you're a man and got another man to please ya
Yo, I'm tellin you, there's nothin like havin girl fever

(Girls
I love the things they know
I love the things they show
I love to be where they go
Pretty girls
I love the things they know
I love the things they show
I love to be where they go)

[ Marley Marl ] Just kick a little somethin for the women

[ VERSE 2 ]
Women - women, women, women, how come?
Every man to you is potrayed as being dumb
We're not dumb, we just love being prepared
Cause certain women never really treat a guy fair
He must have a job, or crazy cash flow
Without that a woman's just gonna say no
And where that leads you - where you began
A place where the only thing wet is your hand
Now how could you survive in a world like that?
Never havin girls cause your pockets ain't fat
So if you got a girl like that, money, leave her
It's easy to survive when you're in girl fever

(Girls
I love the things they know
I love the things they show
I love to be where they go
Pretty girls
I love the things they know
I love the things they show
I love to be where they go)

Yo
Check it out
Since we're here on this mic, right?
[ Marley Marl ] Yeah?
I want you do me a favor, man
Yo, what's up?
See them turntables over there?
Them two turntables over there?
Them turntables right there
I want you to over to them turntables, right?
You know what I want you to do?
What you want me to do?
Yo
Make the girls swing, Marley

[ Marley cutting up ]
(Yes y'all)
(Yes yes y'all)
(I got to get to know your name)

[ girl ]
There we go
Another brother dissin us girls outright
Bring it on
Get out of my space
Get out of my space
Cause I'm gonna -
Get out of my space
Yo Craig, stop playin with me

[ VERSE 3 ]
Fellas, while all the girls appreciate it
Everything with women can't be sex-related
So if your friend has a man that's always up on her
Tell her that's not what she needs in her corner
She needs a man that loves her for a whole lot of reasons
Not just to have you for his personal skeezings
You gotta take a stand and learn to say somethin
Cause if you don't, you're gonna wind up with nothin
Or maybe a baby that never knew his father
Cause he ran off with a lady and he lives in Nevada
Go for warnin signs before he says: see ya
Or you be stuck with a child in the midst of girl fever

(Girls
I love the things they know)
Word
(I love the things they show)
Love the things they show
(I got to be where they go)
Gotta be where they go
(Pretty girls
I love the things they know)
Love the things they know
(I love the things they show)
Love the things they show
(I love to be where they go)
But yo
Think how the relationships go
Ha-ha-ha

Yo
This is to all the girls all around the world
But we're just going by the diamonds, they can keep them pearls
(Girl fe-
Girl fever)
(Yes yes y'all)
You know why?
Girl, I got to get to know them all

I like the girls, ah-ha
I like the girls, yo, yo
I like the girls
And yes, I like the girls, ah-ha
I like the girls, yup-yup
I like the girls, yup-yup
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like the girls
Ah-ha, I like the girls, yup-yup
A lotta girls, ah-ha
I like the girls
I like the girls
I like the girls, oh yeah
I like the girls, ah-ha
I like the girls with the perms in their hair, not the ones with Jherri Curls
Peace

(They're on the jock)
