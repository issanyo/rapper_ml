[KRS-One]

[Hook]
I'm not old school, or new school, I'm all school
Old school, or new school, I'm all school
I'm not old school, or new school, I'm all school
Old school, or new school, I'm all school

[KRS-One]
Yup, it's time for the teacher once more
Bo! bo! bo! bo! Yea yea yea
Yup, it's time for the teacher once more
Bo! bo! bo! bo!

You cats spit raps that are not believable
Your raps don't bubble cause they're inconceivable
Real life O.G.'s don't even speak to you
In hip-hop's culture there's really no need for you
I'll bring the heat to you, when it comes to them Glocks
Like Freddie Foxxx, I'm keepin two
I'm known for my scary feuds
That's why I'm called The Terrorist by the Daily News
I rarely lose, I'm known to rattle a cage
I'm known to throw rappers off the stage
Maybe it's a matter of age
But as a MC I got no patience for some rappers these days

I'm not old school, or new school, I'm all school
Yeah I'll say it!
I'm not old school, or new school, I'm all school

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Yup it's time for the teacher once more
If you bumpin KRS, then you bumpin the raw
I came through the door, with Rakim
Old school, new school, we rocked both of them
"Eric B. for President," check out "My Melody"
Marley Marl he produced both of them
We supposed to win, guestlists, V.I.P
Backstage passes when we rollin in
This the all school, we encompass it all
I teach MC and production is taught by Marley Marl
For alla y'all, just enjoy yourself
Makin your own job, employ yourself
Don't destroy yourself, and don't be fooled
I'm not old school, or new school, I'm all school
Marley Marl, rock yo' spot
This that old school overseen by Scott LaRock

I'm not old school, or new school, I'm all school
I'm not old school, or new school, I'm all school

[Hook]
