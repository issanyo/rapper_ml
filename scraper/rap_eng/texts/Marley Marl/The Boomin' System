[Intro]
Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumping
Yeah, aight, but we need a beat that they can front to
Oh, that'll work, be funky
You know what I'm sayin'?
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
Funky
(Cars ride by)
For all the cars out there
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
And all the brothers
That like to front in their rides
(Cars ride by)
Check it out

[Verse 1]
You know it's funky, funky, funky 'cause you heard it from hearsay
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around
12 o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights breakin' 'cause your batteries drain
Armor All on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
'Cause they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by
And the girls be on my jock 'cause my system's fly

[Chorus]
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)

[Verse 2]
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
'Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this
Mind your business
Now pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While I'm checkin' out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm frontin', and I don't care if you know
The backseat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne?
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise, it's 3 o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me comin'
I'm steady hummin, I got the Funky Drummer drumming
My trunk be shakin', vibratin' and rattlin'
Pumpin so loud, all the shorties be babblin'
My right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showin' off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
'Cause I'm frontin' in my ride and my word is bond

[Chorus]
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)

[Verse 3]
Sunroof open, so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N
To the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N
That means I'm chillin'
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cozy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say: I want BASS
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rollin' up smilin', but you can't come close
'Cause my system is pumpin' loud
Like Rakim said: I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE
Tell the cops: you gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin' that'll break your trunk
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk

[Chorus]
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)
(Cars ride by with the boomin' systems)

[Outro]
You know what I'm sayin', word
So next time you're in your ride pumpin' it up
Just remember
It's cool
Peace
