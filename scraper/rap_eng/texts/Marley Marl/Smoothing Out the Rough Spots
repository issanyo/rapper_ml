Yeah
Smooth
(Smooth brother)
Pumpin the tape in my car...
(Smooth brother)
We go for a ride
Lay back and get real smooth, you know
We gon' smooth it out, knowmsayin?
(Smooth brother)

Hello, here we go, with the flow
MC Craig G is on a smooth type of tempo
I know you're tired of yellin and shoutin
So now I'm about to take a whole different route in
Lyrics, to keep you in the smooth spirit
The easier to listen to, the easier to hear it
So come with me on a mission
A refresher course in hip hop easy listenin
I'm sure you'll enjoy it
The track is smooth, so you won't be annoyed with
Screamin or breakin, so when this beat stops
Craig G'll be smoothing out the rough spots

(Real smooth brother)
(Bad on the mic)
Smoothing out the rough spots
(Real smooth brother)
(Bad on the mic)
Yeah, smooth it out

Did you like it? (Yeah!) I'm sure you souled on it
Watch all the bandwaggon jumpers grab a hold on it
And mistreat it, re-use it, or misuse it
And start messin up the music
But see, smoothness is what this consists of
And over a cliff is where the other noise gets shoved
So yo, tone it down a bit
Not all people really like the sound of it
There's nothing wrong with being hardcore
But bein smooth can get the same crowd roar
So try it, I bet you get props
For simply smoothing out the rough spots

(Real smooth brother)
(Bad on the mic)
Yeah, smoothing out the rough spots
(Real smooth brother)
(Bad on the mic)
Yo, smooth it out one time...

(Cold stone lover)
What am I?
(And I'm a cold stone lover)
What am I?
(I'm a cold stone lover)
Ha-ha
Yeah

I like to get smooth
To make the crowd move
And sway side to side
Damn, this sounds fly
I'm about to go with the program
To make this track slam
But not slam too hard
Cause I don't want you leavin from the place with your ears scarred
But better yet in fact
Yo Marley - (what up, man?) let's change the track
Hm - now that's the way I like it
This is something I really love to write with
And i'm sure you'll be for it
It's smooth, but you still can get on the floor with
Spins, splits, jump flips, and hops
While Craig G is smoothing out the rough spots

Smooth
Smoothing out the rough spots
Smooth it out
Let's smoothe it out
While we're smoothing out the rough spots
Is it smooth
Yo, is it smooth
Yo, is it smooth
While you're ridin to the groove
Is it smooth
Is it smooth
Is it smooth
While you're ridin to the groove

Peace
1990's for your steering pleasure
We outta here
