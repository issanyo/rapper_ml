[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]
Yo, tell 'em we back in this, one-of-a-kind spirits
Be remembered with the time, the sky's the limit
Bitch I'm barely in my prime, this ain't half of the vision
And I'm, uh, I'm mentally in a prison
I'm a man on a mission, until I'm out of commission
God my mama be trippin' thought I'd be bringing in children
Instead I brought in a million
A new house and a million
Bitch I'm tryna raise kids and

[Verse 2]
I said first off, how can I say this all politely?
Fuck the publications dawg, they don't really like me
Took me out their conversations, never did invite me
And any allegations as to why are unlikely true
And I got way more to prove, but this a statement or two
To be set for such wanksta dudes, I've been patient too
Made me more ill-dope for real
Name another Brooklyn cat, major without a deal

[Verse 3]
I destroy average rappers, it's just practice
Eat 'em up for breakfast, being savage a habit
Nigga I done had it, been across the atlas
Been back and even bent backwards
Now I got it mastered, for ten-thousand hours
And every minute after, it's another chapter
Forty seven laws of power over, two-hundred-fifty-thousand albums sold worldwide
And this ain't even half the potential I possess

[Verse 4]
Invest while I reflect
Look me in the eye bitch it's a god in the flesh
Rose and resurrected what they so-called protected
Now I'm at your necklace like a diamond feel pressure
Time is so precious, deathly effervescence
They told me quit reminiscing, get with the present tense
So I switch it up to no style they heard before
Not nostalgia heard before
Ain't no challenge, I'm a pro nigga

[Verse 5]
Yeah I've been a beast with these flows
Killin' these foes prayin' on my downfall
Interrupt the rain-deer with the downpour
Says something 'bout you lames when aiming down below
The drama won't let up, you reap what you sow
Men lie, women lie, numbers sure don't
Got the whole beast coast coming for your skull
The karma gone catch up, the album sales won't
Just one up my collar gon' show
Hollaback when you get sixty stacks for the show
Y'all worried about the clubs, I'm worried about the love
By the looks of it y'all brothers gettin' none
Brothers gettin' sonned, they could use a hug
I throw the direct shots, never subs
Only catch L's, y'all only face dubs
Now I might as well go ahead and pull the plug on these niggas
Said it's---y'all want some more

[Verse 6]
There's two things in life that makes me uncomfortable
When brothers too close or when they think they untouchable
Talking on the god like we gon' let it slide
When he did more dead then you could ever do alive
Now I won't even lie, can't agree with suicide
But in the darkest time, there's still a brighter side
He took a leap of faith and only brightened his light
You took a cheap shot and hate will only shorten your life
Difference between you and him is that he lives forever
You'll be the first to die who nobody ever remembers
Cause the city never needed you ever
You committed career suicide, and made New York better
I gave you one line you made a whole song
Here's some more rhymes you'll be working year long
Let me set the record straight from here on
Whoever said Joey ain't the best, dead wrong

[Verse 7]
Lil' nigga with the big money
Every time you see him, couple stacks on him
He was nineteen with like six figures
Could've paid tuition with tax money
Did it by himself, he didn't need your help
Fuck the major labels, took my own advice
What they want from me? Turned down a milli
Signed deez nutz up on the dotted line
Won't compromise for no dollar signs
Just might switch lanes for the hall of fame
When it's all said and done and it's my time
Every last of you lames gon' know the name
Better don't forget, that slash mama in the S, recognize a nigga getting checks
Fuckin' up the commas, no sweatin' it
I mean I'm even gettin' change from the president
And I don't mean to flex, but if I did I must admit it won't be a stretch
I'm the best at this across the atlas
Top five alive, you can't miss the Bada$$
Couldn't buy drinks, so I bought a Rolex
I took the ice with a, Vashtie Kola
I'm so blessed, need no stress
Deep-throat sex, in that order
Y'all niggas is outdated
Ain't 'bout the action, you past stated
Me man, I'm underrated
At least they never underpay me
Grossed a milli off the world tour
That's on my mama, gave the world to her
Said I'm plotting on the next five mill
Only entertaining six-figure deals
But fuck the money, need a Grammy
And a big house for my whole family
Won't stop 'til I run the city
And every nigga know that the dealy is
Comin' for you and all the affiliates
Fuck your feelings and your opinion
Stacking millions, I'm a militant
Never kill me, my soul is infinite
