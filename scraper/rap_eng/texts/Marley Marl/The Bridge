[Intro]
Ladies and gentleman
We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight
They just came from off tour
They wanna tell you a little story about where they come from

[Hook] x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Verse 1]
You love to hear the story again and again
Of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place

[Hook] x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Verse 2]
Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name, it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean T-Tom
A brother who's known for his rap - Jappy Jap
Larry Larr, third least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
Phase Brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door get frisked, just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town then you couldn't fight and win
But every time they had a jam they couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there in the parks they had to cease
Cause you was in

[Hook] x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Verse 3]
Why don't you wise up show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit your ass had better run
Cause you're in

[Hook] x3
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Verse 4]
Dimples D the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was Sucker DJ's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn out
By any place any part of the world
And while I'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl
While she's in

[Hook] x7
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Verse 5]
Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you may
Don't ever listen to what nobody say
Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
They're trying to lead your destiny
By the time you think about it you're grown
Then you say goddamn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Which people always pulling always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pulling you back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause they're not with it
You're talking about school
They're talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time will fly
But you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal 'cause I'm reaching for mine
And I'm from

[Hook] x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Outro]
Keep on rocking, the bridge will keep rocking
If the beats stop rocking the bridge will keep rocking
If the beats start rocking the bridge will keep rocking
*repeated*
