There's an international language called hip hop
You know what I'm saying
Its like
I could go to any part of the world
And if there's anybody that's into hip hop
We can communicate without words into that point
You know why
Because we are connected through this international
International language called hip hop
You know I believe if
If it was ever wartime or something like that
If somebody heard hip hop playing in the distance
From any side that was doing any warring
Against each other
And they heard hip hop in the night
All through the trees and through the mountains
I be that they would make their way there
And they would have something in common
You know
I think hip hop, its going to save the world
Its like, its the only international language
That's really crossing the boundaries of everything else
You know its pulling people together
That don't even speak the same language
That never, that never really
That never really knew the same thing in their life
Now think about their ancestors
They never really had anything in common
But, you know
You go into this year 2000 that will be better right
And there's this international language called hip hop
That's just
Crossing all boundaries, and races, and creeds, and colors, and (?)
Hip hop its like, its so international at this point man
It makes people that don't have anything in their life ever in common
Have this one common thing in common you know
And they got this love for this game
This international game called hip hop
Its like
It just makes me so ridiculously happy to be, you know
A part of something
That's real
Feel that shit
