[These lyrics are to Bob Marley's "Buffalo Soldier" NOT the Marley Marl song]

Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

I mean it, when I analyse the stench
To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlock Rasta was the Buffalo Soldier
And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival

Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
Buffalo Soldier, in the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do I think I am

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival
Fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier
Win the war for America

Dreadie, woe yoe yoe, woe yoe yoe
Woe yoe yoe, ya ya woe yo, woe yoe yoe
(repeat)
Buffalo Soldier, trodding through the land
Said he wanna ran, then you wanna hand
Trodding through the land, yea, yea

Sais he was a Buffalo Soldier
Win the was for America
Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland
To the heart of the Caribbean

Singing, woe yoe yoe, woe woe yoe yoe
Woe yow yoe yo, yo yo woe yo yoe
(repeat)

Trodding through San Juan
In the arms of America
Trodding hrough Jamaica , A Buffalo Soldier
Fighting on arrival, Fighting for survival
Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta

Singing, woe yoe yoe, woe woe yoe yoe
Woe yoe yoe yo, yo yo woe yo,woe yo yoe
