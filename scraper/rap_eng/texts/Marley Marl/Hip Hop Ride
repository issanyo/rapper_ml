[Verse 1: Qur'an]
As I flip it again, I'm on the loose
Watch me, nah man, hold up, no...
As I flip it again, we're on the loose
Watch us set the trend for the 9 double deuce
Check it, to the boogie the up jumps the boogie
To the rhythm of the boogity beat
Cause I Freakit like this like my homeboys Das
"It Ain't Hard to Tell" like my main man Nas
Like Naughty, watch me give a hip-hop hooray
Much props to Dre drinking Tanqueray
I could Chief Rock ya like the Lords
Or like Tribe, go on an Award Tour
Too Slick like Rick, watch Da Youngstas bump
Cause this is how we're coming like the future of the funk
Respect out Cube kicking it Really Doe
And Snoop Doggy Dogg and the whole Death Row
Gang Starr, Sumpreme C, and Cypress
On the reel to reel cause I'm keeping it righteous

[Chorus] (x2)
C'mon let me take you on a hip-hop ride
Move side to side, let your body glide
Slide, slide, slide, slide

[Verse 2: Taji]
Well groove with me as we go on this mission
Taking you on a female expidition
We keep it going as we get deeper
We got Boss, Monie Love, and Queen Latifah
Word up, these sistas got it going on
A mad shout out to my girl LeShaun
And Smooth in that Lexus coupe
And peace to Salt N Pepa cause you make me wanna Shoop
Yeah, but y'all don't hear me though
Cause I'm on the Westside with my girl Yo-Yo
So rock on with your bad self, Rage!
A female in this hip-hop age
Stop look and listen, please don't byte
Coming straight from my homegirl MC Lyte
Peace to Shant√©, Sweet Tee, and Sah-B
Representing hip-hop lovely

[Chorus] (x2)
C'mon let me take you on a hip-hop ride
Move side to side, let your body glide
Slide, slide, slide, slide

[Verse 3: Tarik]
C'mon let me take you on this hip-hop ride
Move side to side, let your body glide
Knock knock, it's hip-hop at your door
Giving you more for '94
Back with Melle Mel and Grandmaster Flash
People thought that hip-hop wouldn't last
The Treacherous Three, Afrika Bambaataa
Kurtis Blow made hip-hop hotter
Slide to the rhythm, let your body jerk
Remember all the bass from my man Kool Herc?
Stetsasonic Talking All that Jazz
You know the songs of the past
I keep creeping, I'm a Youngsta but I'm deep in
History that's keeping everything cool
I use my mic as my tool
Peace to the old school

[Chorus] (x4)
C'mon let me take you on a hip-hop ride
Move side to side, let your body glide
Slide, slide, slide, slide
