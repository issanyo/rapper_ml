[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
The last time I caught a body it was recent
Gimme a HK, four banana clips, and I'll take on a precinct
Yeah, the murder rate is on the rise
With niggas like me, steady poppin'
Niggas are droppin' like flies
I get 'em and when I hit 'em; I hit 'em hard
There'll be no 'Get Well' cards
Niggas straight to the motherfuckin' graveyard
Cause me, no matter, get 'em done
Me pickin' the one and lickin' 'em up and hit 'em up for fun
He thought him bullet hit me, but him didn't get none
You better run son, before me gonna go get the gun
Murder me? You must ain't have heard of me
And if you get rushed to emergency, I'm shootin' niggas in surgery
Another nigga shot dead
And even the cops and the feds can get a hole inside they fuckin' head
Another nigga life is took
I'll be at your wake motherfucker signin' my name on that book
Inside the morgue another body freezes
It's one more bitch nigga that I sent to meet Jesus
Puttin' niggas to sleep on white sheets
No ambulance, just paramedics scrapin' your brains off the streets
So yeah motherfucker, come get a taste
Cause I'mma give your punk ass my two in the face and beat the case
My finger's on the trigger, I'mma pull it
So now you know that Kool G Rap is number one with a bullet

[Hook: Kool G Rap] x2
"Puttin' niggas to sleep"
"number one with a bullet"
"scrapin' your brains off the streets"
"My finger's on the trigger, I'mma pull it
So now you know that Kool G Rap is number one with a bullet"
