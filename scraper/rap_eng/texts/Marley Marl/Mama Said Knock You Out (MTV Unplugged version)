Don't call it a comeback!
Don't call it a comeback!
Call it anything, don't call it a comeback!
Don't call it a comeback!
Don't call it a comeback!

[Verse 1]
Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
Rocking my peers and putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosion, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop, when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

[Hook:]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)



[Verse 2]
Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhummad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
Cause you know I had beef wit
Why do you riff with me, the maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready cause it might go
BLAAAAW, how ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
Breakdown!

(Piano player playing "Hard to Handle" by the Black Crowes)

Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Clap your hands
Keep it going now
We're getting funky, you know what I'm saying?
Word up, we're gonna pump this up
Keep it going now, keep it going now
One more time, word
There's too much of a groove, check it out
Clap your hands
As we go into it like this here

Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio HUUUH!!!
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane, starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain, I maintain
Unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing
Digging and drilling a hole
Pass the Ol' Gold

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill, at will
The man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
DAAAAAM!!!!! Oooooohh!!
Listen to the way I slaaaaay, your crew
Damage UHH damage UHH damage UHH damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy so suckas I'll slay him
Farmers (What?!) Farmers (What?!)
I'm ready (We're ready!!)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down!!)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock
Hard! Knock you out, mama said knock you out

(Repeat chorus)

Breakdown!

Word up, God bless
Now I want everyone to [?] like this here
This is a private affair, it's a private party
It's real close and intimate, we all in here together
Come on, say "Leave that crack alone"
Leave that crack alone
Come on, everybody say "Leave that crack alone"
Leave that crack alone

(Repeat chorus)

Peace!
