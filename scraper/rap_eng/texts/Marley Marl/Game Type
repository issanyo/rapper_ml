[Marley Marl]
Hey yo man Trag man
What happened to that female Sharay you used to be kickin it to, man?
[Trag]
Ah man, why'd you have to ask me about that?

[VERSE 1]
Women are game type and swift
Therefore you have to be sharp when you shoot the gift
Okay, here's a little story about what happened to me
It might have happened to you, but if it didn't you'll see
It was warm one day, so I threw on the silky
And some pattened leather Bally's, I was lookin rather milky
And my partner Mad Mark coolin in the mansion
You know the one who's on the hill making crazy trap
We was drivin through Harlem with the system pump
Had a cooler full of MoÃ«t, it was in the trunk
Proceeding on our course to 7th Ave
Saw a redbone cutie that I wanted to bag
( ? ) profile made it a challenging play
Said, "Excuse me, what's your name?" She said, "My name is Sharey"
With the mix of a mack and the game that's gift
I carried on the conversation with the slip of a lip
I extended her a car with her number and name
Passed her a piece of paper and she did the same
Received a call from Sharay that following day
As soon as I heard her voice all I thought about was screwin
I answered very quickly and said, "Hey how you doin?"
Her voice broke down as she started to say
"MC Trag, I'm feelin lonely and I'm ready to play"
Ten minutes after that I was on my way
The first date was smooth, I enjoyed it a lot
The more time we spent together the more she got
I put jewels around her neck, gold teeth in her mouth
Even took her on tour when I went down south
It was all about us, no longer single and solo
I bought her fur coats and shirts by Polo
Liz Clayborne and the best Benneton
Wide selections of Gucci and Louis Vuitton
It was all in the name of love, that's what I thought
But Sharay was a trick and the Trag got caught
But that's not the half, so hold on tight
Gonna tell ya 'bout Sharay cause she's too game type

Game type
(Sure you right)
Cause all the girls are game type
(Sure you right)
Most of the girls are game type
(Sure you right)
All the girls are game type
(Alright)
Okay

[VERSE 2]
Saturday night, I call Sharay on the phone
But her answering machine informed me that she wasn't home
I left a message at the end of the beep for her to follow
That I was washing up and getting dressed for the Apollo
Stepped to the show with a bottle of Dom
When I looked upon the mic Rob Base was on
The crowd started buggin as the music played
Out the corner of my eye I seen Sharay
She was huggin some kid, but it was just too dark
When the lights flashed on em, I saw it was Mark
My first reaction was to just step to em
But then I said damn, I can't do em
Mark is my partner, he got game, so he took her
I take it as a loss, huh-huh, forget the looker
Sharay was kinda swift cause she thought me a a lesson
(Yo man, was you hurt, Trag?) No question
It really doesn't matter (Sure you right)
Please let me finish up the story cause she's too game type

Game type
(Sure you right)
Some of the girls are game type
(Sure you right)
Most of the girls are game type
(Sure you right)
All the girls are game type
(Alright)
Okay

[VERSE 3]
The show was finally over, so I followed em out
When they both jumped in the car it just bugged me out
Hey yo, she tried to play the Trag but I was just too swift
Ran to the corner, caught a cab at 125th
Told the driver hurry up before they get too far
Slapped a yard inside his hand and said, "Follow that car"
It seemed like hours before they finally stopped
Then they both jumped out the car and went straight in the Marriot
Headin for the desk to rent a room, I couldn't let em
I pulled out my gun cause I was just about to wet em
Mark must seen it cause yo, he hit the floor
Sharay started screamin as she ran to the door
My DJ Fatal pulled up in a Chrysler LeBaron
It was him, my two dancers and a girl named Sharon
He said (Yo man, hurry up, man, we late for the show)
I thought, go to jail for her? Hell no
Put my gun in the side, then I jumped in my ride
We put the pedal to the metal and we started to slide
Just remember this story when a girl looks hype
Never fall for their game cause they're too game type

Game type
(Sure you right)
Most of the girls are game type
(Sure you right)
All the girls are game type
(Sure you right)
Hey yo, the girls are game type
(That's nice)
