[Verse 1]
I'm myself called a hood because I walk with a limp
Would you believe they even call my boy a hip-hop pimp?
Like Dr. King I had a dream, I couldn't sleep too long
If I had to stand alone, I'd still be strong
Men are all equal, we're the Father's creation
What used to be the distant land is now my nation
How long will it be, how many suckers must die?
There's only one answer to the question why
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, 'cause I'ma get mine

[Verse 2]
Unalike's attract and a-alike's repel
And if you buy dead dreams I got plenty to sell
All the money in the world couldn't buy my knowledge
My teacher was experience, the streets was college
It's a shame that many had to learn this way
So I never take the word of what the next man say
Head-a-arm-arm-a-leg-a-leg-a
Supreme High Being, Sole Controller, not a beggar
My true manifestation of Shan
I never fell, I held my destiny within my hand
On the day that I was born I received strike one
Because my culture was an Asiatic native son
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, cause I'ma get mine

[Verse 3]
My foundation is strong, so I had to destroy
Do y'all remember Cheetah, that was Tarzan's boy
My main motto is self-satisfaction
Life's a movie with no cuts, all straight up action
If you roll as a sucker, then a sucker you die
And six feet up above you is the heavenly sky
I haven't heard of any comin' back to tell
Dyin' must be heaven, cause livin' is hell
You sit around and wait for your wish to be granted
And the next thing you know you're being buried and planted
Your body is the temple, the brain is the center
A door to explore, but you're scared to enter
Mind means many in need of direction
And the dictionary listed in the poverty section
You're nothin' but a novel on a bookstore shelf
And see the title of mine reads: "Think for Self"
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, cause I'ma get mine

[Verse 4]
You say you're sick and tired of bein' rejected
And you think you do better bein' crime-connected
Just for example let's say that you're twenty
Got a Benz, fly girls and doo-doo money
Moms ask: "Where you get it?" What you gonna tell her?
You dropped out of school, became a drug seller
You say you knew what you were doin', you say you were smart
Next week they beat you down and bust a cap in your heart
Your knowledge is the sun, you better let it shine
No matter what you do with yours, I'ma teach mine
