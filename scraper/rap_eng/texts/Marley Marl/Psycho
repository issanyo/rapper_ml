[Hook 12x:]
Psycho

[Verse 1: DoItAll, (Mr. Funkee)]
Excuse me, Mr. Funke, man (Yes, DoItAll)
Can I take the stand and slam like Bam Bam? (Like who?)
Like Bam Bam that kid from Bedrock
And don't turn around 'cause you might get popped

One-two, microphone check from the ..
It's time to run from my brother who's insane
Strictly run in twos and to the corner
.. Just to take another hit!

Freestyle..me
..back soon or immediately
My force is strong, like Obi Wan Kenobi
Some don't believe so now I had to show these styles
The difference, the force, the pattern
...

[Verse 2 Mr. Funkee (Doitall)]
Excuse me Doitall  (Yes Mr Funkee man)
Can I step on to the stand like great slam? (Like where?)
Like on field past the  shortstop (Yeah)

??

Well, I'm nuts
A straight up maniac, so call me psycho
Do you house static?
Yes, so get the rifle
They kill 'em, smoke 'em, oops, I meant choke 'em
With the cord of my mic, and watch his head start floating like boom
