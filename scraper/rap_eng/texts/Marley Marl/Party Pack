[VERSE 1: Tragedy]
I'm a poet, storyteller who's tellin it
My raps cause lyrics that are relevant
I drop science that's highly medical
I think I stimulate because I'm so theoretical
( ? )
And makin mad money means more MoÃ«t
Rap renegade, vigilante who's visual
And you'll agree I'm one bad individual
Teenage type takin the time to tear
Alternatin a rhythm through your atmosphere
More fierce than Freddy when I'm on your function
My rap provide a smooth introduction
Live Motivator, Marley Marl is a mack
Party pack, party animal, this party is packed
Rhythmatical reciter, rap's a rapture
Rebel of the trebel, MC Tragic capture
A party in a second, tape or record
It really doesn't matter cause I still get hectic
Renegade with rank, I'm equipped to wreck
Stimulatin your system when I sit on your set
I'm just another person on the path to perfection
Slip syllables with a style in my selection
You never hear another who's as nice with the needle
I'm livin large, I could never be little
Maintain your movement, relax and max
Enjoy yourself, this is a party pack

This is a party pack

[VERSE 2: Tragedy]
Technician on the technique is in control
Manipulatin your manoeuvre on your FM mode
Takin the time to terminate a turntable
I knew my cousin Freddy Krueger since the cradle
Havoc is hype causin 100% juice
I lick a lyric, let it go and let loose
Generate and alternate cause I'm a general troop
MC Trag and I'm down the the Juice Crew group
Like a prophet proceedin a party with direction
Original, the proof is my complexion
Mad metaphor with more material
Rap renegade, Asiatic imperial
Superior speech when the syllable slips
I'm a smooth narrator, never non-descript
He's the wizard at work when he's sweatin the wax
(Believe that) This is a party pack

[VERSE 3: Tragedy]
I detonate the dancefloor puttin rhymes in your direction
Select and direct with a style in my selection
Composed, conducted by the king of cut
This beat is kinda brutal so just move your butt
With the speech spontaneous for all spectators
Mentally mad cause I'm the Live Motivator
Rebel and writer, recite the recital
Rap veteran, vigilante who's vital
The depth that I drop goes past the devil
Lab technician on a synthesized level
Expose and express with poetic emotion
Deadly to your function, rap devotion
Better than the average MC, ya heard?
Cause the Trag gets busy and that's my word
