Hey, what up ?
What's happening Cool?
Where you off to?
Over to Foster's
Say what? What's happening over there?
My man, Captain Rock is getting ready to land the Dip-Ship
Hey man I'm getting ready to go over there with ya hold on
Captain Rock getting ready to turn it out

Heeey, here's a story that must be told
About a man from space who required some soul
Ya see, huh, I come from Pluto, aimed to make you dance
Guaranteed to put the ladies in a trance
Cause I'm 5 foot 6 got silver Dip-Ship
Come on in I'll take you on a trip
To Venus, Mars, Pluto
Girl, it really doesn't matter to me
Cuz all ya gotta do
Is fasten your seat belts and hold on tight
As I rock you through the galaxy'
Here comes a blast!

(beatboxing)

Cause I'm the spaceman in the crew I want to talk about
There's one superior DJ without a doubt
He's scratching Al D!
From the planet galaxy!
And he can slice any record in harmony
He's the master on the wheels of steel
Listen to him because he's the real deal
He's cool, calm, stays real ?
You got to listen to him because he's real (fresh)
Then there's a cosmic crew who wants to be known
As the super house rockers on the microphone
We'll thrown down hard, we'll make ya shake all night
And we can rock any party to the broad daylight
We're just a bunch of guys who like to have fun
We're gonna keep on rocking to you all have some

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

We're the Cosmic Crew

Now before we leave, I must achieve
My talent on the mic to make you believe
That Captain Rock is like dynamite
The only MC that will never bite
Ya know, the only man that can fly around the world
In 40 days and take 150 girls huh!
The only man who can set your mind at ease
I come to Earth, I aim to please
I'm the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour
The man on the go, too fast to be slow
So while the music electrifies your body
Shake shake shake and party hardy
Move your feet and go side to side
And then you're doing the dance called the cosmic glide
Heey, throw your hands in the air
And reach for the top like you really don't care
I got a vicious voice just like old times
Fascinating, devastating, I got rhymes
And just stand right there, don't go nowhere
Cause I've got a good thing we can share
Lend me you ear and give me your hand
And I will take your girl to rock rock land
With a rock rock there, a rock rock here
Here a rock, everywhere, there a rock
It's Captain Rock!

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

Now I can feel the fire lifting me higher
The temperature is on the rise
Now just stand there and don't go nowhere
Cause here comes your sweet surprise
I'll give you love, make you feel good
Separation through your soul like a spaceman should
Make you jump for joy, scream and shout
And party people that's what we're all about
I don't mean to brag I don't intend to boast
I just want to known from coast to coast
And I'm here tonight to propose a toast
To special young ladies who stand all close
And wave at me cause I rock so viciously
I want all the fly girls to admire me
Because I got style, I got class
And everybody comes when we get the badge
They talk about me over martinis
And even watch me cable TV
So if there's anything else you'd like to know about us
Ask the Captain, I won't put up a fuss
I want to control your body and soul
And make you feel like ten pounds of gold
Cause I'm a aggravater, a fly ice skater
A fast talk rocker, the cold house shocker
Spaceman from across the land
And if you don't believe what I'm saying is true
I come to rock the microphone just for you

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you

We're the Cosmic Crew
We're gonna rock for you
