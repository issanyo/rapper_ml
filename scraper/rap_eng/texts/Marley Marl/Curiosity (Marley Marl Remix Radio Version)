[Intro: Aaron Hall]
It's the curiosity
It's the curiosity

[Redman]
A-yo, Word is Bond
This the way the East Coast rocks
Home of the hip-hop, hustlers and drop-tops
And who I be? Mr 07103
Spittin' hollow point lyrics but there's no gun on me
My heart cold like winter, so enter
Heat the party up with Remy and ginger
Now who's next to test these steez
Redman and Aaron Hall real vocal-eeze freeze
Blah z blah, look me eye to eye
Doc for nine, takin pounds of my Tical
Why must I feel like that?
Because curiosity killed the cat

[Aaron Hall]
You spend so many nights in heat and out of control
Waiting impatiently to see what's under my clothes
I just wanna take time, to get right into the point
Now you got your chance girl to come & rock this funky joint (Joint)

Don't wait too long
I'll be waitin' here
For you, baby, baby
Here's a gift to you from me
Just you wait & see, it's the curiosity

It's the curiosity
It's got you
It's got me
Make you wanna feel my body

It's the curiosity
It's killin' you
It's killin' me
Make you wanna feel a part of me

[Redman]
A-yo Woo Woo
Reggie Noble's gone loco
Watch the POPO
I spit it like a tres-ocho
I flip my styles spot silly, the Glock's empty
On a whoopy MC
Who body dropped 50
So when I rock R&B tracks I'm real
Ask Aaron Def Squad
Like Bob Marl we jammin (we jammin)
Yo Marley hit me on the cut
The curiosity is causing women to give up
But, so I point out a few, I ran through
Occupation been diesel since
Teddy's Jam 2
Pointy picker, I get sicker
Known to hold a mic but I can't hold my liquor
All the real freaks feel my techniques
With no shoes on rolling up the Swisher Sweets
And since I keep it street, I do not sleep
I gotta regulate, though this week
And It's on son, and it's on like that
And It's on motherfucker, and it's on like that
And It's on son, and it's on like that
Feel the rythm of the funk Marly Marl track

[Aaron Hall]
I had you guessin' from the time that we first met
That curiosity had always killed that cat
I know you're curious to see what I'm about
There is no doubt that I'm about to turn you out

Don't wait too long
I'll be waitin' here
For you, baby, baby
Here's a gift to you from me
Just you wait and see, it's the curiosity

It's the curiosity
It's got you
It's got me
Make you wanna feel my body

It's the curiosity
It's killin' you
It's killin' me
Make you wanna feel a part of me

It's the curiosity
It's got you
It's got me
Make you wanna feel my body

It's the curiosity
It's killin' you
It's killin' me
Make you wanna feel a part of me

It's the curiosity...
