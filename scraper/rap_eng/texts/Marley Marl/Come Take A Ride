Come take a ride, come catch a vibe
Come take a ride, come catch a vibe
C'mon
Come take a ride, come catch a vibe
Come take a ride, come catch a vibe
C'mon
Come take a ride, come catch a vibe
Come take a ride, come catch a vibe
C'mon
Come take a ride, come catch a vibe
Come along, come along

[Verse 1: Seven Shawn]
All aboard the ride
Come catch a vibe, there's sweet drinks inside
Sugar coated drinks just to ease the pain
Come on and knock one back so we can X-ray the brain
I detect it won't wreck, son
We got cheech in all flavors, select one
Yo, I only work for Allah and His will
That's why I didn't have to claim to kill to get a deal
Feel the vibe, you can't see because it's mystical
You know, the light never ever had it physical
Raps suck, 'resting for blacks but...
Brothers abuse it when you kept yo' facts on wax, don't use it
Sit back and relax and just recline
As we stop time, time exists in the mind
I'm outta here, I'm about to touch Saturn
There's seven rings, come on peep the pattern

[Hook]

[Verse 2: John Doe]
Take a ride with the Doe, no need for seatbelts
Just skipped up my press bits(?), it's hot enough to sheet-melt
From the sheet to the mental, has to stick like a dimple
Hit the studio with the herbal instrumental, it's simple
But many cannot get down with the format
Soultriber(?) couldn't get it, thought I didn't, but I saw that
Sleepin' on the door, I got more lines than a Kilo
Roll ahead, crack a silo, make 'em wanna peep my steelo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Seven Shawn]
I'm on the gas, I'm outta here black
I got the seeds and the wisdom, so I ain't coming back
The God's reign is all mental, you know I can get real
I bring smoke to the track when I'm on the DL
There ain't no clapping
Just gotta let the dream ride while I'm rappin'
Hope the 85'ers coincide
So come on, come on, there ain't no time to waste
Put the knowledge to the brain so we can make haste
Let's raise fund, right into the light, I'm in flight
It's all right when I got a mic
Now I ran the track, see what's loose
Since I rode the front, John you ride the Caboose

[Verse 4: John Doe]
I heavy so I'm big time, I have no time for small raps
My skills abound, sell like CRACK with the tall caps
Get in ya stance, make a fist because the fight's on
Makin' rappers scatter like the roaches with the lights on
Make it boogie-woogie, get down like a sock hop
John Doe's the man, you know the time like stop-clock
If you don't break a hip or scream "Oh dip!"
That means the skip that I kicked wasn't hittin', worth shit
The baseline blows your mind like an I-Wind(?)
So drop the dime, because we talkin' it for prime time
No wins when you step, cause you must learn
When it comes to a rap I shoot a verse like sperm
Seein' is believin', there's no optical illusion
My sound pours crowds like an underground confusion
So listen to the beat and take a ride
Bounce with the Doe and catch a vibe
