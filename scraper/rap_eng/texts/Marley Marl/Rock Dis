[Hook: KRS One & Craig G]
One for the treble, two for the bass
Come one Craig G let's rock this place
One for the treble, two for the bass
KRS let's rock this place
One for the treble, two for the bass
Come one Craig G let's rock this place
One for the treble, two for the bass
KRS let's rock this place

[KRS One]
Just a little bit of promo here
How I emcee, the journalists they won't go near
Is it cause I flow so clear
Or is it cause the 44 right there
Now you like oh oh yeah

[Craig G]
Ay yo Chris
Just a little bit of teaching here
Pay attention class the lyrics and beats so clear
They speak on it but never in the streets nowhere
If they wanna get raw
Bro they scream no fair

[Verse 1: KRS One]
The victory is almost there
Its like we oh so near
But the object is to show no fear
So when I do this here
Some of you just stare
Others criticize, others act like you don't care
But someday oh you'll be there
Yes you'll be there
When the party's over you'll see clear
You think you got me figured out
But you ain't in it yet
If you ain't break, if you ain't graf, if you ain't really sweat
If you ain't rap, if you ain't DJ'ed up on any set
How you writing about the elements that you ain't mastered yet
Radio program is forced to be selective
Rap journalists are taught to be objective
Now they got these new rap detectives
Money, sex, drugs can't be our only incentive
See I don't care
If you don't like what you hear
I teach my class in the club
You can sit in the rear
So yeah
Craig G, my mellow my man
Why don't you get on the mic
You got the world in your hand

[Verse 2: Craig G]
I got the world in my hands
Plus this girl is a fan
Push a button I'll appear like HBO on demand
He's real as a witness lies told on a stand
He's mad cause me and Chris are controlling your fans
As far as hip-hop
We the ones holding the plans
He made the Blueprint
For Christ's sake you know he's the man
Craig G, yah you know me
I'll smoke at the chance
Watch the flames go out
You better grab ahold of a hand
Say the wrong thing
I'll be 44'n your man
Get it mushy
Turn his body parts to dough where he stands
No DNA evidence, not a hair strand
Back in the bank account
Now I got a stolen advance
My people carry heaters
Make you go in your pants
While I'm on a plane to Holland
Where I'm blowing the plants man

[Hook: KRS One & Craig G]
One for the treble, two for the bass
Come one Craig G let's rock this place
One for the treble, two for the bass
KRS let's rock this place
One for the treble, two for the bass
Come one Craig G let's rock this place
One for the treble, two for the bass
KRS let's rock this place
