[Hook] {x4}
Visions of cream, I dream a worldwide theme
That nigga Larry O meets Iceberg Slick

[Verse 1]
Late one night after a flight straight from Cleveland
Niggas hardly breathing
Just escaped the yellow tape this evening
Son I'm back home, well protected by the chrome
Gates keep jakes snakes looking for cakes
I put the 740I in park, whispers in the dark
Fuck around kid you can catch a spark
Hit the front door on my marble floor
Was the reflection of a kid I know I seen before
Could it be a pussy that I bust
A nigga that I rush
Looking like a nigga Larry O would never trust
Looking him eye to eye I realize
This mirror type image kid is blowing my high
He said, "My name is Iceberg Slick kid you know me
It's green as cash, I'm the other half of yo' ass."

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
With all due respect this was the willie of all willies
Cuban cigar lit, me myself I'm touches Phillies
The entity revealed in front of my face
Pussy niggas I touched up, my mind's in a different place
I'm seeing all the coke I stole
Murder victims that turned cold
Money bitches rocking gold
But in 1996
The realism sticks
You can't fuck around up in the mix
But we still got it locked, sewed
Bricks on hold, damn that nigga had a mean stroll
Now I'm waiting for the confrontation to erupt
He stepped inside of me I said, "What the fuck
Is happening?"
It's kinda sick the way it went down
I'm looking in this mirror at the way I look and sound
I'm having

[Hook]
