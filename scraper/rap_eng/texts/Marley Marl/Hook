Don't call it a comeback
Heres a fun fact
I keep my lyrics sharp like a thumbtack
I don’t keep contact with labels offering contracts
Because my name ring bells like a hunchback
Clout, bought it straight from my account
These cost an amount that you couldn’t count
If you wanna run with me you better be on your best
Because I’m about as untouchable as Elliot ness
Flexing, I’m just counting my blessings
I’m gonna teach you a lesson so sit down class is in session
All my records, they billboard successes
Because the truth of the game is there ain’t no half stepping
Like hey, why do I even need a hook?
It’s not like I even use a rulebook
Half the time that leaves me misunderstood
But I’m gonna rep it like only Lil Tyde Podd could
Like hey, why do I even need a hook?
It’s not like I even use a rulebook
Half the time that leaves me misunderstood
But I’m gonna rep it like only Lil Tyde Podd could
The people who throw me shame they gon be detained
Diamond  on my keychain, bought it on Ebay
Flex it like I’m Lil Tay, feel like Andre 3k
None of you can keep pace, when I be on a relay
Better call the Rhyme Bustas, here’s a roll call
If you add a quarter to your profits it will just get you a phone call
All these other trappers tryna rap but they be so dull
Their lyrics so nonsensical it sounds like its Roald Dahl
I remember when I was all one fish two fish
Now I made progress since then and you see it in my music
If you got writers block call this album therapeutic
So many kids call it fire I’m finding it amusing
Hey, but that’s how it goes
I mean just think of where I was at just a month ago
Made a Youtube channel released my music to the world
My statistics say that I have views in Trinidad and Tobago
(Actually though where is that) (I have no idea)
(Weird)

Like hey, why do I even need a hook?
It’s not like I even use a rulebook
Half the time that leaves me misunderstood
But I’m gonna rep it like only Lil Tyde Podd could
Like hey, why do I even need a hook?
It’s not like I even use a rulebook
Half the time that leaves me misunderstood
But I’m gonna rep it like only Lil Tyde Podd could
