[Verse:]
Don't call it a comeback, It's more like a streak
Last time I checked, you couldn't last one week
Now, how you look sittin' in my daggone seat?
Wait, let me see if I can laugh on beat
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Easy come, easy go, bye bye
Shero, I'm about to go beastmode
Next time you ain't comin' back, no sequel
Silly folks think I'm gettin' pity votes, really?
I'm really dope, really, really, really dope
Feel me?
Stop the hate, It's part of being great
God put me here, and God don't make no mistake

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna rock this house (Huuh!)
Mama said rock this house (Huuh!)

[Verse:]
Wow, let's set the record straight right now
The only thing I wanna know is how, sway, how
Style is no, your vibe is no
My name ain't Meghan but I'm trained to go
The rhymes you say are just OK
I'm lit, gotta quit, gotta knit crochet
For all the late bloomers, I'm ready
It's not a rumor
And after Little Bri and Vanilla Ice Jr

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
I'm gonna rock you out (Huuh!)
Mama said knock you out (Huuh!)
