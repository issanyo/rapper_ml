Y'all better get it together, word up

When Rap City got started, I was there
When KDAY got started, I was there
When Jive Records got started, I was there
When Yo! MTV Raps started, I was there
When The Source magazins started, I was there
When Cedric and Seda started, I was there
When Biggie was doin his album, I was there
When Tookie Williams was buried, I was there
'73, Cedar Park, I was there
One-twenty-three park, I was there
You ain't tellin me the history cause I was there

[Hook]
I WAS THERE! (And where were you?) (Where were you?)
(And where were you?) (Where were you?)
(And where were you?) (Where were you?)
(Where were you?)

When Moe Dee challenged LL, I was there
When that bus blew up in London, I was there
When Death Row challenged Bad Boy at the Source Awards
In New York at the Garden, yup, I was there
When Kwame Toure, formerly known as Stokely Carmichael
Was passin on, I was there
When Nelson Mandela was freed from prison
And spoke out at Yankee Stadium in New York, I was there
For all the births of my children, I was there
When the Rodney King uprisings happened I was there
These objective rap historians tryin to document
Hip-hop from outside forget it, I was there

The Warner Brothers Records label, I was there
The Koch Records label, I was there

Y'all need to get it together with hip-hop's history
And get it right, cause yup I was there
