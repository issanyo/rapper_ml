What's wrong with you, man?
You crazy!

Highly acclaimed that's Shan the epitome of rhymes
Can't dance so you can't get rid of me
Line after line there's cause and effect
But I first test the mic with the 1-2 check
The Hip Hop world made the Juice Crew orphans
Gained our respect sealing up much coffins
We're all obligated to Juice Crew Laws
You'se a perk if you let a man take yours
Number 2 is not to follow, yo, you must set trends
And if you ain't down with us, you can't be friends
Many of my so-called boys just flip
But the thrill of it all - you're on the tip
You should be glad there is no tricks
On ours so hard we wrote your name on our...
Mix after mix every record we make
Don't compare or scare, so I dare you to take
Any part of the rhyme or the kick drum sound
I be meeting you, defeating you and beating you down
My name rings bells and make rappers petro
God help you, kid, when I get upset, yo
The bass starts to roll bid your fans farewell
Cause the chance of you winning is like snowing in hell
My rhymes say more than a tasket, a tisket
Too clever, yo, I never go out like a biscuit
Don't try to take my spot and not be legit
Try to fit my shoes and your feet won't fit
You're good, but compared to me you're not nearly
You think you can serve me? Come on, really
Til I can't breathe, yo, I'mma be with it
When I hear three words, you got it, I get it
My style is wild but strong and you're temporary
Violate the Juice Crew Laws and I bury
Send you to the land of peace and tranquility
Suckers have the knack but they lack my ability
Those who tried to dis in the days behind us
Back on the dick since the brothers signed us
Make the mistake and I'm breaking your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law

Never too alert but I'm always cautious
And a few of 'em own a few Mercedes and Porsches
Suckers get paid by means of extortion
My rhymes take your mind by means of abortion
Rhymes create wings that time can't fly on
The mic that you bring on stage you'll die on
Sit back and watch your life get jettisoned
If rhymes were juice I'd be Con Edison
Do as we say, not as we do, as a custom
A sucker tried to snatch my chain and I bust him
I didn't cuff him and read him no rights
I knocked out his service and turned out his lights
Be a fool if you want and let your boys divert you
Soup you up to battle me, kid, and I'll hurt you
Superior intellect made me a phenomenon
And I can go on and on and on and on
You can be blind but my rhymes still focus
A sucker tried to violate law and I broke his
Albums and tapes and his compact discs
And his boys stood around and said (yo, he dissed you, Kris)
Straight up not split by a hyphen
Cut you to pieces without putting a knife in
You won't bleed but you feel just the same
Now answer me right, boy, what's my name?
(Shan) These words are are small innuendo
Guaranteed to decipher the mice from the men though
Now that I have the power make a refinement
Revealing the snakes is my next assignment
Make the mistake and I'm breaking your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law

For those who betrayed me picture being afraid of me
A few I know wish they woulda never come played me
Though I'm decked in my suit you can't play me like rummy
Teach you how to rhyme, say Kris, dummy
The same theory if the words don't fit
Got the nerve to get on stage and wanna sing that...
Wait a minute, wait just a second
You know that's not my style - sorry, just checking
But don't it make you sick when they be kicking la-di-da-di
But I got what it take to make you wanna cold rock a party
Too hot to touch, too cold to hold ????? sadness
Junk you pop gets you dropped, stop the madness
My style is wild, my son, my child, selective
Built to stay tough, written rough and effective
I tangle ya, mangle ya, strangle ya and then maul ya
This goes for you and you and you and all ya
Make the mistake and I'm breaking your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law
