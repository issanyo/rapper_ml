[Verse]
Yeah, yo, it's unanimous, I've had enough
Take me out the Animus, I'm cracking up
And going bananas, son
Skinny white boy's making a lot of noise
Crazy, like trying to run the Matrix on a droid
So call your boys, and tell them to all rejoice
Whenever they hear the sharp sound of my scrawny voice
Iâ€™m Kryptonite to Superman
The kind of dude to sacrifice the cutest lamb and ask God, "Who's the Man!?"
If Columbus had a GPS
He never would've found the land where the teepees rest
He would've got to India safe
And this big blue world would be a different place
Every day, many die from hunger and genocide, and the whole world just lets it slide
But, one celebrity dies and everyone cries, yo; the state of our moral values is jeopardized
And where do I fit in to all of this?
A scrawny kid with balled-up fists, yo
Look, I'm spitting fire like an arsonist
Got rappers shaking in their boots like they got Parkinson's
Yo, I'm a modern transcendentalist
Who tends to spit level-headed with intelligence
A blend of devilish malevolence and a friendly temperament
Makes me very dangerous to meddle with
Yeah, I go places most people wouldn't venture
I sever all my tethers, then I delve into the Nether
Then I break the fucking portal, and dwell in there forever
And I do all of that because I like the weather better
Your bars are shittier than dysentery
I'm making other rappers look like fucking pixie fairies
You best be wary, I'm a verbal visionary
With lyrics sweeter than a jar of maraschino cherries
I'm an analyst, an activist, and anarchist
Happily laughing while I'm smacking a pacifist
I'm doing magic tricks, pulling rabbits out my hat and shit
Am I high or asleep imagining this happening?
Yo, I'm a lyrical gladiator
Who battles rattlesnakes and alligators, with a pen and paper
I mainline my great lines
Then stay high where planes fly
Then stage dive with Great Whites
Yo, I guess I'm having a great life

[Outro]
Calling out Killa Kre, Token, and Gradient
Keep this shit going, man
