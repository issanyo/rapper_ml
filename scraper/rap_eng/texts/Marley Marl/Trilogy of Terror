[Verse One]
I run rappers like races, cut 'em like razors
Burn 'em like lasers, and stun 'em like phasers
Cause my brain thinks and it blanks your memory banks
Sharp as shanks and poetry is like Big Hank's
Give me a pen, a typa-writer then
I'll cut your whole posse into gingerbread men
With diction, sparked from friction
Plenty of dope like the pope cause it's a G Rap prediction
Power going outer space, louder bass
Replaces the weak rap race
Ashes to ashes, flashes of smashes and crashes
Another big man bashes
Fright; it's a silent night, but it's a violent fight
My talent might explode like dynamite
Lyrics blast out, all evil will cast out
Fast and at last all rappers passed out
Wax the vocal tracks all out like whistles
Clear like crystals, loud like pistols
Here to get it straight for the '89 era
This is a killer G
In a trilogy of terror

[break]
Uh
Yeah

[Verse Two]
Lightning and thunder, rappers going six feet under
Kool G Rap makes you wonder
No blunders or mistakes, this takes hard concentration
Effort, for the method, meditation
Visions of bright collisions, tight decisions
Suckers'll end like divisions
Listen I'm like a seed from a demon, a blessing from an angel
Way more mysterious than Bermuda's Triangle
Riddle fit to hit, put together bit by bit
Like a do-it-yourself kit
Then I'll hold your soul on a remote control
So-called MC's will freeze so cold
Then get viewed and examined in a test tube
If you're a square, you freeze into an ice cube
Talent switches, words to riches
You get stitches, rhymes are wicked like witches
Horror, terror, pain, rip like a hurricane
Freeze like cocaine, or you get a smoke brain
G Rap, Polo, Doc the Butcher all together
We're forever
The trilogy of terror
