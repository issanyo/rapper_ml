(Uhh) uhh (uhh) uhh (uhh) Haa (with the remix)
Jigga (Doo doo dooo) feel the funk Marley Mal (Shai)
(Doo doo dooo) uhh huh
Uhh haa (Doo doo dooo) uhh haa, (Doo doo dooo)
Ha ha

[Jay-Z]
At times you could find me in the city sinnin'
Or in a studio touchin' the track up like pretty women
Spittin' venom with the snake skins &
Apply the pressure to you & ya mens &
Damage I do career endin'
Y'all know what I'm representin' funds
Extra low got a one on a tent next to dough
Y'all best to know I'm not alone My
Music menage trois with Shai & I ha haa

[Shai]
Girl it's been been so long girl without you (say what)
& I swear I hate livin' without you (uhh huh)
With some peace of mind I've been confined without you
Tomorrow won't come
If I spend the night without you (uhh uhh uhh check it)
Every one for this love thang I'm feelin'
& I can't fight this urge that I'm feelin' (uhh huh)
Baby can't ya see it's destiny I'm feelin'
Spend the night let me show you what I'm feelin' (Come on)

Chorus

I don't want to be alone tonight
Why don't you stay with me?
When girl you said you'd never go
My baby don't you leave me

[Jay-Z]
I'm on top of my game act like ya know
Think I didn't see the lame sneakin' in the back door (ha haa)
It's aiight he can come here for real
You aiight but I'm done here
I don't keep my ones here
It's unlikely that you see wifey
But if you slip up and hit up
We could split up
Playa hata not at all
I don't play those games
You got beef with Jigga?
Say my name, you shy?

[Shai]
Lately I seem to think I need someone
Of my own just to hold me is there someone
Who will stay with me forever be that someone (remix)
Always there thick & thin you're that someone (uhh uhh uhh)

Oh baby stay
So baby won't you stay with me tonight
We can reach ecstacy
Girl we can both reach ecstacy all night

Chorus

[Jay-Z]
Let's get this show on the road
Cristal on the rider I got the
Big Apple in the smash like cider
Roc-A-Fella & Shai money
Tryin' to see Guy money
They want a piece of ya love
I want at least a dub
Mail cakes bills straight what
Have we here Cartier ill faced
On the highway accompanied by a friend
First the Range then the Lex'
Then the buggy-eyed Benz Ahaa

Chorus

I don't want to be alone (toonight)
I don't want to be alone (tonight)
I don't want to be alone (toonight)
I don't want to be alone (tonight tonight tonight tonight)
I I I [Marley Marl remix Howard Pitts Nine-six futuristic
