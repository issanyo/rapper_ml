[Verse 1]

Were you ever at a club where girls were looking fly
And there was one that was giving you the sexy eye
Of course you were, I was in that position
But when I stepped to the girl she started dissing
So I calmed and let her know I wouldn't have it
Then someone passed me a microphone and grabbed it
House the set, got an ovation
And that seemed to change the whole situation
She started hogging me, tearing me, bugging me
She was addicted like Gearason drugging me
So I told the girl simple plain, get off my back you see

[Hook]

This ain't no thang [Scratches]
A love thang

[Verse 2]

Now I remember this brother that was making a track
And every time he met a girl, he thought through his raps
One girl in particular her name was Jenny
She never liked a man that had to pinch a penny
Every time he approached he'd take never
And that would just make him work harder than ever
Dime for dime, dollar for dollar
Until he had more than he could tolerate
Yo I mean hops was straight
The more the cash, the more the girl would conversate
But came Jenny, she said you insane
I could never talk to you you see

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

There was this couple that lived next door to me
Together so long that that they were sure to be
Married, then the girl had changed a bit
It wasn't good so he had to complain a bit
He often asked the girl where she'd been
But she would start an argument so that she wouldn't answer him
So because he didn't know the problem
He went on his own so he could solve em
He knew his girl was out with somebody
So the first place he checked was nightclubs and parties
After searching his ego was ruined
Cause he had an idea of what his girl was doing
He was upset then he thought to himself
Why should I be mad if she's hanging out with someone else
Know what I'm sayin? I could do the same
Just act too nice and two can play the game
So he went to clubs to chase women
Not even worried about how his girl was living
And this went on for a couple of weeks
Only in the day when he and his girl speak
But at night it was a whole different thing
They didn't know each other and man did they swing
Dinner plates, skates also hot dates
Till one hot date turned out in a fate
Out on the pry looking for a chick
The type of chick that he could stick real quick
Found a nice one, went to the crib
Got her on the couch and flipped her like he never did
An hour later they were lying on their back
Both stark naked finishing a six pack
And then his wife came down the stairs
With nothing but a robe on and messed up hair
But then standing way at the top
Was this man he knew from right down the block?
And there was no way that they both could explain
Cause simple and plain
