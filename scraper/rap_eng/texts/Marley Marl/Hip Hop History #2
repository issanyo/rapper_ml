Hip Hop evolves from
Coming, you know straight out of the park you know
Cats used to like plug up in the street lights in the street
Run the extension cords across the street
You know what I'm saying?
And make it rock
You know?
Came outside with PA systems
You know barely having sound systems
Like, PA systems
Unmatched turntables
Not even mixers, you know what I'm saying?
(?) speakers with no bass
Screaming the sound of hip hop
Coming straight out, you know?
Its like crazy man to see what it is right now
You know?
Its like, its like a million dollar thing right now
Started from one plug in one park
One light, one future
Hip hop
(Clap your hands)
One light, one future
Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
