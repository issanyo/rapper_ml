[Discussion: Marley Marl]
Cause for real there was a time you know
The beat was the most essential part
No for real
The beat was the most essential part of the track
Then, then we would pick up the other pieces
But yo that's then and there though so yo
So when Peter, you know Peter told me
Yo, yo, Marley let's get involved with this beat generation series
I'm like yo the beat generation
What would that mean to me
What would I do
I'm like yo so
(?) some of them late night tracks
Some of them live sessions
You know what I'm saying?
And yo
That's how this beat generation was born
