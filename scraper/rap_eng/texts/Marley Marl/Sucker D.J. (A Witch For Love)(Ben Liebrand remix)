You ready to kick some ass?
Turn up the music...

I was at a jam the other night
I was feelin' real good so the feelin' was right
I came to the party for a different kinda action
The next thing I know I was doin' a Michael Jackson

I was thrown off beat and my feet got tied
And the Sucker DJ just oughta be fired
He was flippin' and a slippin' even drawn back to
The Sucker DJ didn't know what he was doin'

Then I said to my friends this ain't the place to be
Then the fellas only came cause the ladies were free
Then we left the place before the next couple o' plays
My girl said to me, I'm glad we never paid

So I called Marley Marl on the very next day
Then we cut a rap about the Sucker DJ (echo)

See, to be a DJ you gotta do your best
Have you're own kinda style, not like the rest
No jumpin' up and down, bendin' with your feet
Cause the music that you play has to be your own beat

So Marley Marl went down to take a test
To see who could cut up music best
They were all lined up and ready to spin
You could see in thier faces that they wanted to win

Yes Marley took the test to become a DJ
We cut the music, went a somethin' this way
He cut the music with so much class
The Sucker DJ, was a bust on the ass

So when the time was up, they just couldn't' believe
What the man, Marley Marl Has just achieved
We get the people dancin', on a whackier jam
Cause Marley Marl was one hell of a man

So to those DJ's that think you're the greatest
Just stop look and listen cause you haven't heard the lastest
Heard the latest...

Then we cut a rap about the Sucker DJ (echo)
Then we cut a rap about the Sucker DJ (echo)
Then we cut a rap about the Sucker DJ (echo)
Then we cut a rap about the, cut a rap about the
Cut a rap about the Sucker DJ

So listen party people while I got your attention
There's a few more things I'd like to mention
My name is Crystal but they call me Dimples D
Ain't a female in the world can rap like me

I got big brown eyes, holes in my cheeks
Keep in time with rap, every time I speak
Yeah I can make you fall in love if you give me a chance
I ain't talkin' 'bout sex or no kinda romance

But it's my style, my charm, let me go on
It's a chilly, it's a chilly, then it starts to get warm
I'm five foot five, stayin' alive
In this world Dimples D will sure enough survive

With the rap... (unintelligible)

Get down, get down, yeah let's get on down
Get down, get down, music make you lose control
Get down, get down, yeah let's get on down
Get down, get down

Then we cut a rap about the Sucker DJ (echo) C'mon, C'mon
Then we cut a rap about the Sucker DJ (echo) C'mon, C'mon
Then we cut a rap about the Sucker DJ (echo) C'mon, C'mon
Then we cut a rap about the, cut a rap about the
Cut a rap about the Sucker DJ (echo)
