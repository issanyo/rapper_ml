Yo baby
Put your seatbelt on
I got my paperwork, don't worry about it
It's cool

[Sample]
Do you wanna see it?
Do you wanna see it?
Do you wanna see it?
(it's cool-)
Do you wanna see it?
Do you wanna see it?
Do you wanna see it?
I'm gon' do it
I'm gonna do it
I'm gon' do it
I'm gonna do it

[Verse 1]
What the hell are you lookin' for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
Wear my jewels and like, freak it on the floor
Or is it my job to make sure I'm poor?
Can't my car look better than yours?
Keep a cigar in between my jaws
I drink champagne, to hell with Coors
Never sold coke in my life, I do tours
Get that flashlight out of my face
I'm not a dog, so damn it, put away the mace
I got cash and real attorneys on the case
You're just a joker perpetrating a ace
You got time, you wanna give me a taste
I don't smoke cigarettes, so why you're lookin' for base?
You might plant a gun, and hope I run a race
Eating in the mess hall, saying my grace
You tried to frame me, but it won't work
Illegal search

[The Flex (LL Cool J)]
Keep on searchin' (And I'm totally relaxed)
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Keep on searchin'-

Keep on searching
Keep on searchin'
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Keep on searchin'

Keep on searching baby (Illegal Search)
Keep on searchin'
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Keep on searchin'-

Keep on searching
Keep on searchin'
Gotta, gotta, gotta-

[Verse 2]
I call it 'nice', you call it a 'drug car'
I say 'disco', you call it a 'drug bar'
I say 'nice guy', you call me 'Mr. Good Bar'
I made progress, you say, "Not that far"
I just started it, you're searchin my car
But all my paperwork is up to par
It's in my Uncle's name, so the frame won't work
Punk - Illegal Search

[The Flex (LL Cool J)]
Keep on searchin'
Gotta, gotta, gotta

Keep on searchin'
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Keep on searchin'-
Keep on searching

Keep on searchin'
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Keep on searchin'

[Verse 3]
On the turnpike, and everything's right
In the background is flashin' lights
Get out the car in the middle of the night
It's freezin' cold and you're doing it for spite
Slam me on the hood, yo, that ain't right
You pull out your gun if I'm puttin' up a fight
My car, my clothes, and my girl is hype
But you wanna replace my silk with stripes
You're a real man, your uniform is tight
Fingerprint me, take my name and height
Hoping it will, but I know it won't work
Illegal Search

[Sample (The Flex)]
Do you wanna see it? (Keep on searching baby)
Do you wanna see it?

[Refrain: LL Cool J]
Hey yo, Marley
Take it to The Bridge

[Sample]

[Refrain: LL Cool J (The Flex)]
Keep it there

I'm gettin' ready
I'm gettin' ready

[Verse 4]
I was sued to court, the case got thrown out
I'm that man that you all read about
Put me in jail, you're doin it for clout
I only got one question: what's that all about?
Jail is something that I can do without
Case dismissed, and now you wanna pout
You feel like trying it again, but you know it won't work
Illegal Search

[Sample]
Do you wanna see it?
Do you wanna see it?
Do you wanna see it?
I'm gon' do it
I'm gonna do it
I'm gonna do it
I'm gonna do it

[The Flex (LL Cool J)]
Keep on searchin' (Yeah)
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Keep on searchin'
Keep on searching baby (Illegal Search)

Gotta, gotta, gotta

Gotta, gotta, gotta
