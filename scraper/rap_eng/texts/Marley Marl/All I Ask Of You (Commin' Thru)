[Verse 1]
Yeah, premeditated poetry's just as, smooth as the wind
X-rated shinny nickel plated [un?]-entro my shin, let the slaughter begin
When fatigue sets in, taking pictures with Mac-11s with my scandalous grin
And putting trauma on your brain I'm certified insane
I'm taking, cee-lo money, slick is out on the train
They got the city under siege it's a freeze on keys
Now I'mma have to catch a break to put my mental at ease
But I press finesse and express with [buddha bless]
Do the death threats I sport a camouflage vest
My microphone is like my tech committing verbal homicide who wants to test the respect?
I take a complicated mess and bust it out in one session
Chickens be taking flicks just to capture my essence
On terrain I reign, giving [adversaries] pain
The world is a ghetto it took a toll on my brain

[Hook] {x2}
I been with people thats connected, it's best to be protected
The Real Live is number one son, just accept it
Strength recognise strength come see the crew
Real Live is commin' thru

[Verse 2]
Check it
I'm sitting back and smoke living broke 'ain't no type of joke
Sometimes I 'ain't tryin' to wake up I wanna croak
I spark the cambo, then consume the blast
I'm thinking of the game, I'm thinking of the past
[Living fast?] a hundred and fifty grand in cash
With the burner in the stash get courageous you dead ass
My [?] was confidential and so was my mental, I found it essential to put some ice on my presidential
Wrist watch but don't snooze, I'm bouncing with the [techs and the Oo-s?], banging out crews
But now I'm looking for the opposite rout, it's not - who got the biggest guns - the C.R.E.A.M is what it's all about
Now I'm seeing dollar signs I can't wait to turn the white into green and put some steak on my plate
To all my players in the game stay true

[Hook] {x2}

[Verse 3]
Now look who giving orders no bridges over troubles waters
Not working for quarters, crossing boarders, performing man slaughters
I full analysis [look I turn dough]?
Now I do transplants removing brains from skulls
Now your mind is empty, and you need something to fill it
Yeah I can fill it with lyrics black talent bullets that will not be bonded
My barricade's like Berlin, behind the wall I'm bound to bash bones and [?]
Broken down to bridle, baby bust a little
Chickens begging for bank but can't even [bomb?] a little refrain
From getting caught in the act, making crap tracks
Stress, comes off my chest when I damage backs with Mac's
Your rhyming is rubbish, I knock the phlegm about niggas
Verbal phlegm, that carrying on the sickness
To all my players in the game stay true

(That's all I ask of you....)

[Hook] {x4} (All I ask of you...)
