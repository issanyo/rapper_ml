[Intro]
Yo man I heard that you got some new rivals on the block. Small time thugs, working for big time thugs feel me?
I can break em' down in no time, show me where they are
(Driving sounds)
(That's The Way I Like It plays in the background)
Really??
I like disco!! So what?
Nothing....park here. I'll see ya later
Ok
(Car door slams)

[Verse]
Pull up on the block, park the car and get the hell out
Black jacket, ski mask, no way for witnesses to tell out
Put the chrome in the thug's mouth, "If you wanna live another day
Either run shit my way or the dead motherfucker way
It's your choice, I don't give a fuck if I live or die
You can shiver and cry, but it won't matter when I shoot your liver and sigh
I run this block, that block and every block after
Or I'll turn you into a ghost, bitch made looking like Casper"
I shot a homeless man coming round to show I ain't playing
I ain't laying for rivals to walk on me so quit saying
I'm sorry, I'm sorry; I won't forget it please I'm sorry
You looking like an evil motherfucker with shark teeth
"I want the car keys now, and when I come back, I better get mine"
The scared motherfucker had to pull up his zip tie
He warned me that he'll do it but I'm messing with the wrong people
They're more evil, they devour prey like bald eagles
I smacked him in the nose, and I got into the Lincoln
I thought of spilling out his brains to see what he was truly thinking
No time for that, suspicious car, I pull out the chrome again
I just want to make money and then go be home by ten
Two shifty eyed people walking up to me funny
Asking me why I'm trying to barge into their money
I'm like look asshole I gotta make my cash flow
You run shit on my block? You gotta pay the tax, ho
They notice the pistol on me and started stuttering
Muttering some stupid shit and I notice the blood on their rings
They killed someone recently and stole it off they corpse
Read the paper last night and heard they fed it to a fucking horse
Kill or be killed, I pulled the pistol out and shot em' both dead
Put em' in the trunk of my car, stole all of they bread
Chopped the bodies up, brought it to the meat factory
Free food for the poor and a bunch of fucking cash for me
I dropped the hot shit off at the pawn shop
I picked up all of the cash when I saw cops
They pulled me to the corner, questioned me
Said they knew I run the block and it was best to see
That the smartest way to move was to make some friends
I thought sure, load em' up, grease their palms with lead
It was a bad day and I was irritable at best
Stole all the good shit, pawned it, and put the bodies to rest
At some hill somewhere, I forget where
At the end of the day, lookin' fucked up so I get stares
Whatever, got some free cash
Walked upstairs in the slums, saw some PCP cats
Saying they would sell for pretty cheap
I thought "How the fuck am I gonna let them sell in my city streets"
Threw the chrome again and forced my way inside
I told them not to sell off shit that they knew was mine
I controlled the market, so don't start shit
I put the chrome into their dome and threatened to puncture cartilage
Oh shit, the drug addict had a stroke
The way he looked when he died, it probably was the coke
I wiped away any trace of fingerprints, let it sink on it
Looks like an accident, looking forward to drink tonic
So fuck it, I got some money, got into my pad and then I drank
Face planted on my bed like I felt dead and then I sank

[Outro]
The search for two police officers have turned up unknown, with the last suspected whereabouts of them being at a pawnshop, where they were running on an investigation on two drug dealers, who were suspected to have killed a rival and fed his body parts to a horse. In other news another homeless man died of a stroke last night, rumors say he was also a drug dealer and many thought it was drugs that killed him but medical professionals say that the man had a history of strokes. When asking a neighbor to comment on the situation, he said that he didn't know shit, he just got home from work, and he told us to fuck off. It seems no one knows who this man really is, if anyone has information please contact information. Now back to Madison for the weather
