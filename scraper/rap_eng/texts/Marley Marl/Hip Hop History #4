I first got introduced to hip hop
For real though
Like I used to go to this crazy 600 school
High school up in Manhattan
(?)
You know I was from Queens
You know
There was cats in from the Bronx you know
Know what I'm saying
There was cats from Brooklyn up there
You know from uptown Manhattan, Staten Island
But anyway
There was cats coming from the Bronx
They had rap tapes
You know
Used to all (?) at lunchtime
Like that's kind of hot right there
Break down tapes
You know
Grandmaster Flash tapes, Furious Five tapes
You know
All them battle tapes
We used to check it out
It was all love you know
I said yo, I'm living in Queens
These cats living out there
You know what I'm saying
There was cats living uptown
I said yo let me do my thing in Queens
Know what I'm saying
I like where that's coming from right there
I started doing my thing
You know I got the Sure Shot crew
Up in the projects
You know we did (?) up in the (?) center
You know you had to pay before you entered
It was real like that
Know what I'm saying
But a lot of cats had to come though Queensbridge
To show how tight they was with hip hop
Bambaata came to Queensbridge
We had Grandmaster Flash back in the day
You know what I'm saying
Show & AG, everybody that was popping at the time
Treacherous, you know they had to come through Queensbridge
You know
They say like yo we travelled outside the Bronx
We did our thing so we can rock Queensbridge
So it was like an honor for anybody to come through there and rock Queensbridge
Know what I'm saying
That's what it was all about
It was like
You know
It was all about peace and harmony at that point
And then crack came out
