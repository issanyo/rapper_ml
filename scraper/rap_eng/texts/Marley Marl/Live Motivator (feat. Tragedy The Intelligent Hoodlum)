(feat. Tragedy)

(Live moti-) (live motivator) [x4]

[VERSE 1]
I have the mind of a sick psychiatric
Protegees perish with my tactics
Terminate, excel, I bust brain cells
I'm international, my name ring bells
Define definitions like a dictionary
Impulse impact, cause I'm a visionary
Tragedy elevates to the exterior
Imperial superior, you're inferior
Intelligent trooper, I detect
And I design paragraphs like a architect
Spittin fire like a serpent, lyrical merchant
Their level of progression, born to detour
Able to lift a ton of lyrics like a 4x4
Paragraph professor, strong metaphor
Pumpin bass like a Bertha, talkologist inserter
Torture, slaughter - then I murder
Gladiator rebel, trained to cause havoc
The microphone manipulator, and I'm Tragic
Science is dropped when times are convenient
I label the lyricist a form of genius
Rhymin is a skill, the source is energetic
My techniques are brilliant, and I'm hyperkinetic
Individual intelligent, concept navigator
Tragedy, the Live Motivator

[VERSE 2]
Recite rhymes like a poet use the pen for my endurance
Techniques are abusive, so is my performance
Record rotating, life is is motivating
The master of lyricists, rhymes coordinating
Einstein of lyrics, mad psychopath
Rather listen to the Trag on your phonograph
Original Asiatic, rhymatical mechanic
Jettin like a Uzi ammunated automatic
On the strenght, I'm terrific, rhymes are hieroglyphic
Use a potion in a motion, my brain is scientific
Rhymatical motivating, chief-annihilating
The lyrical poet be your exterminating
Born to destroy, talkologist terminator
The rebel of the treble, the Motivator

[VERSE 3]
Rock a jam and emotion elevate and increase
Jettin words by the syllable, piece by piece
Pronounciation is related, rhymes are updated
Don't let your kids listen, cause I'm x-rated
Intelligent Hoodlum, brain mutulator
I.Q. of a genius - the Motivator
Let's do this, Brutus, prototype inspiration
Rhymes inject turbo motivation
Deep dialogue, the poetical
You can't deal with the rhymin energetical
Sound captivated, rhyme activated
I rock even better when I'm stimmulated
Attack like a pitbull, physically brutal
You can't hang, cause you're soft as a poodle
I'm debonnaire, poetically charmed
I can go through several battles, and still remain calm
Got a strain on the brain, I'm here to gain
I stimmulate ya like a sniff of cocaine
40 dog buster, I'm here to thrust a
On lyrics a definite must, a
Papermate prosecutor, the executor
Process the data like a computer
Proceed with the topic, I came to drop it
Don't try to stand in my way, you can't stop it
Marley Marl, pick up the crossfader
Tragedy, the Live Motivator
