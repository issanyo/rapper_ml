[Intro]
Everybody funky but they don't know how
Let the Lords of the Underground show you how
Everybody funk and they don't know how
Let the Lords of the Underground show you how

[Verse 1: DoItAll]

Well I was born in the year of the black ??? shoe
When my mom did the Whomp in the bellbottom Zooks
Now I'm picking at my 'fro, so you better beware
Cause I'm coming with that funk like I just don't care
Well I'm whoops-a-daisy, my parents had a funk baby
Now I am an addict, and that's just got me crazy
Sending ???
And nothing but the rhymes trying to ???


???

Now everybody want to be a funk-ateer
But don't know how ??? funk rip the ???
So check it, now I got it locked on the record
And if you go and get it, I bet you won't regret it
So peep it, just like the joint ??? did
A rebel for that funk, and that's how I keep it

[Chorus]
I'll be the keeper of the funk, they know just who I am (X4)
Cause I'm coming with that funk like I just don't care
(Repeat X2)

[Verse 2: Mr. Funke]

All hail gamma funkular

I can't wait to get on stage, grab the mic, and show my ass
And if the girl is on my tip, then check her

I ain't joking,cause if i get it in my clip I'm stroking

I mean come on now, half of ya'll don't really know what drama is (yea)
You know you ain't half the man your mama is

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: DoItAll]

Now when the mothership landed, even though not on a planet
I still felt that vibe, that's why I feel like slammin'
So here, take a little bit, mix the funk with scripture
Hip-hop with that funk, now here by the picture
With my frame
