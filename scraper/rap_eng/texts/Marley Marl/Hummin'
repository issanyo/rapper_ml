[Chorus]
Humming in the sun
Sure 'nuff fun for everyone
Humming in the sun
Sure 'nuff fun for everyone

I'm humming in the sun
Fun for everyone
I'm laying here
Grooving

[Chorus]
Humming in the sun
Sure 'nuff fun for everyone
Humming in the sun
Sure 'nuff fun for everyone

All I really need
Is lazy time
I can feel the sun
And its all mine

[Chorus]
Humming in the sun
Sure 'nuff fun for everyone
Humming in the sun
Sure 'nuff fun for everyone

I'm humming
On (?) vibe
I'm humming
On (?) vibe
I'm humming
On (?) vibe
Mmmmmm

Humming in the sun
I'm humming in the sun

Mmmmm mmmmm
Mmmmm mmmmm
Mmmmm mmmmm
Mmmmm mmmmm
Mmmmm mmmmm
Mmmmm mmmmm

[Chorus]
Humming in the sun
Sure 'nuff fun for everyone
Humming in the sun
Sure 'nuff fun for everyone
Humming in the sun
Sure 'nuff fun for everyone
Humming in the sun
Sure 'nuff fun for everyone

I'm humming, humming
I'm humming in the sun
Sure 'nuff fun for everyone
I'm lying here, yes I am
I'm just grooving
Everybody, everybody
Everybody hum
Hum mmmm
Hum mmmm
