Now you know this just don't make no kind of sense
I'm still not yours and after all the time we spent

No sense
You say it makes no kind of sense
No sense
You say it makes
No kind of sense

No sense
You say it makes no kind of sense
No sense
You say it makes
No kind of sense

No sense
You say it makes no kind of sense
No sense
You say it makes
No kind of sense

When I first met you
You were my kind of guy
My heart would beat ten times too fast
Whenever you pass me by
But now you make me wonder
I just can't figure it out
I sensed a change in you
And of this I have no doubt
You hardly come to see me
And not like you used to do
And after all that's said and done
It seems that we are through
But when you add it up
And you see its incorrect
Although it makes no sense I guess
Its better to forget

No sense
You say it makes no kind of sense
No sense
You say it makes
No kind of sense

No sense
You say it makes no kind of sense
No sense
You say it makes
No kind of sense
