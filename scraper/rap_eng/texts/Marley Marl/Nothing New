[Intro]
Aiyyo Kris man! (Yo)
I'm seein a lot of movement in the industry right now
I'm seein a lot of cats (uh-huh) comin into the industry
But they got the wrong idea (I hear what you sayin, I see it)
Nah but f'real f'real, a lot of cats comin into it like
"Yo what could the industry do for me?" No!
What could you bring to the industry?
What could you bring into the industry? (I hear you Marley, I hear you)
F'real (look, watch this)

[KRS-One]
Nuttin new, nuttin new, dem not sayin nuttin new
Nuttin new, nuttin new, dem not sayin nuttin new
They run they run they run they run they run their lyric through
But when you're finished rhymin you have not heard nuttin new
So this one dedicated to the one that run their rhyme-a
Time after time after time after time
I know what you will say before you jump up on the stage
But make sure you don't say "Di-di-di-dah-di-di-di-day"
Then we'll have to look for you and chop you all up
So when you see me in the street just keep your mouth shut
Nuttin new, nuttin new, dem not sayin nuttin new
Nuttin new, nuttin new, dem not sayin nuttin new; what
Everything you doin kid we already did it
Everything you spittin kid we already spit it
This my 15th album I'm havin FUN wit'chu critics
Everything you doin kid we already did it
If rap was a toilet, I woulda already shit it
Critics sayin, "Kris you shoulda already quit it!"
But I can't stop won't stop spittin crazy lyrics
Cause I, +AM+ hip-hop, other rappers just try
You critics wanna sit down and debate every line
But tryin to get into my concert same time
Spot all packed up, cops yellin "BACK UP! BACK UP!"
KRS yellin "SOUND MAN TURN THE TRACK UP!"
We act up the whole spot a hour straight
We rock 30 classics, at least 20 breaks
We always in demand and, you must overstand man
We won't be found man on Billboard or SoundScan
Seek me, and you will find
Where I be kickin or spittin that ill rhyme
Until then, they can't see me, cause I be
In the heart of every rapper I shine
Nuttin new, nuttin new, dem not sayin nuttin new
Nuttin new, nuttin new, dem not sayin nuttin new
They run they run they run they run they run their lyric through
But when they're finished rhymin you have not heard nuttin new
So this one dedicated to the one that run their rhyme-a
Time after time after time after time
I know what you will say before you jump up on the stage
But make sure you don't .. YO! YO MARLEY TURN ME UP A BIT
Which one of you punk-ass rappers
Wanna get chewed up, like seafood platters?
Bring your best rhyme, it don't matter to me
You ain't gettin on tonight by battlin me
The streets won't forgive you man, them guns go BLAM
Have you crawlin up the wall like Spider-Man
You all in the jungle, with no Spears like Brittney
Like the coke want Whitney, you still wanna get me
But no, you ain't, made for this
I put my hand through your chest like Agent Smith
I jam like them big four-fifths
I go off like a Glock 9, no safety on Kris~!
Y'all talk 'bout platinum, I don't need all that
I got 26 gold AND platinum plaques
I'll take away your rights like the Patriot Act
Have your whole crew thinkin, "Well maybe he is kinda whack!"
Hahaha, oh - you know what happens after this
Win or lose, you know what happens after Kris
They call me Blastmaster cause I be blastin
Have yo' ass lookin like Jesus in "The Passion"
