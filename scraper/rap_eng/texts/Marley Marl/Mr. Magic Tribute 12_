[Intro: Marley Marl] (*Marley Marl Scratching)
And you know sometimes man.......
You never know what you missed, if you can't touch it again...salute!
(*Biz Markie: Mr. Magic!)

[Chorus]: (Sample Courtesy of Patrice Rushen "Remind Me")
Listen close realize why Hip Hop is where it is
The reason that your favorite DJ is spinnin It's (Magic)
Give it up for (Magic) Make way for (Magic) Let's Go (So Magic, ummm hmmm)
Yeah! Been rippin down airwaves for y'all from the get go
The originator of the Hip Hop mix show It's (Magic)
Give it up for (Magic) Make way for (Magic) Let's Go (So Magic, ummm hmmm)

[Verse One: Big Daddy Kane]
I remember those days from the past when the tone rocked
From blastin the boom box till your ass in the room locked
Listenin to the voice of Sir Juice past curfew
A friday and saturday night virtue
You're not a DJ so don't compare handles
The radio's first one to ever Clear Channels
And that should live forever kid that's where It's at
Since your name is Magic, it's just a disappearing act, you'll be back

[Verse Two: MC Shan]
Mr. Magic, I'm a miss you, I love me Super Rockin'
Without you, hip-hop just wouldn't be poppin
You made me who I am in so many of ways
And thanks for puttin rappers on the radio waves
Bid my final farewell 'till I see you again
Now I spill a sip of wine for my partner-in-crime
Better meet me at the gates, 'till then, I'll be missin you
Rest in peace forever, from a fan, a Super listener

[Verse Three: Craig G]
Aiyyo! "Be yourself  'fore ya find yourself  by yourself"
One man said it there was no one else
All I ever wanted to hear was "World Premiere!"
I knew at the top of Hip Hop I was there
I just wanna salute, the leader of The Juice Crew
Before the game was based on YouTube
Obstacles we moved through, Craig G verse strong
You know when I'm speakin, "The Rap Attack" I rhymed every weekend

[Verse Four: Roxanne Shante]
...And you would grab the mic and say
"There's a lot of Roxannes' but only one Shante, now get 'em"
You were smashin right on the air
Tell 'em to change the game, takin names because it's outta here
And all I say is that's my crew - WHADDUP!
Sir Juice forever, that be you - WHADDUP! (Oooo-OOOOOOOHH!!)
And nothing we did was ever shockin
'Cause I'm Shante and you're Super Rockin' forever

[Chorus: Biz Markie] (*TJ Swan)
We are reeeeeeeeeeaaaalllllly gonna miss him!!!!
Who we talkin 'bout (Magic) Who! (Magic) Who! (Magic) Who! (So Magic)
We are reeeeeeeeeeaaaalllllly gonna miss him!!!!
(*His name is Biz Markie and my name is TJ Swann!)
Who we talkin 'bout (Magic) Who! (Magic) Who! (Magic) Who! (So Magic)
(*Tribute to Mr. Magic were rockin on and on!!)

[Verse Five: Marley Marl]
No one ever knows, when one soul goes
And when that soul grows, he leaves his foes
Back-to-back, Friday and Saturday
Lookin back, I couldn't have it, no other way
Crossfader, goin back and forth like click click click
While you proceed to smackin off that lipstick
Flex finally admit it, we used to put it on him
I'm back up in the saddle, it's about to pick on, B

[Verse Six: Biz Markie]
The first DJ that believed in us
(The first DJ played us on the radio!)
He had the golden voice, he was the people's choice
He had the crowd in the palm of his haaaand!
Word is bond, he was a phenomenon
Hip-hop lost a wonderful man!
Just like karate move, we gonna forty deuce
We're gonna miss Lucky a/k/a Sir Juice!!
