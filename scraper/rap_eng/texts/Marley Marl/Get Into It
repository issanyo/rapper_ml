[Verse 1]
Allow me to introduce myself
As the authentic, ultimate, def now is there anything else
That I can use to describe my name
Ah hell with it, I'm the Big Daddy Kane
An entertainer that keeps the crowd thrilled
As I emcee, no better yet as I build
To party people as we go through
Hey just for this occasion, tell you what I'm gonna do
Say a rhyme that you all can quote
I guarantee that you'll agree that it's like dope
Cause all I have to do is pick up the mic
And live from New York it's Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Well here we go, and yo
I want to see you on the floor and go for what you know
I'll endure to give you more, or
Just enough to keep you on the dancefloor
Because I rule parties consecutively
To put a posse so much in effect it'll be
A stampede, what the party need
And then you know a brother like the Kane G'd off
With the rhymes that I display
So let the music play and by the way
All the party people that came to attend
If you want to get busy this is what I recommend
(Get into it!)
Get on the dancefloor, and
Allow my record to give you a hand
I know you're not Freddie Jackson but that's alright
You can still come to me and say "rock me tonight"

[Verse 3]
As I was saying, that
Coming off on the mic is where it's at
So when I'm rapping, you know I got to get ill
I mean me being wack, be for real
For me that's a big no no
When I rock the microphone solo
My rhymes are crisp and clean, no caffeine
Well supplied, purified so you know the routine
And in parties I prove it to you each
But on the strength I'm really only here to teach
Those that still are not equipped
Cause when I grab the mic I just rip and go do it
I go through it
So all the party people (get into it!)
