Step into my world
Where we walk around with them things
If you get wrong we go bang
And we serious popping, we bang
Welcome to my world
Where we never sleeping with it
Keep them bank rolls and I feed it
Got it bad for them sinners
Welcome to my world
You gotta act right, talk right, walk right
Step into my world
Welcome to my world, welcome to my world
Welcome to my world

It's me against the world, the world
And it's been that way since a young nigga bout trigger play
Hurt my arm letting off that cake
Money better be the conversation, otherwise, no compensation
No, I don't really do friends, brother, brother count big faced Benjamins
In my world, we sell cocaine, crack and pot, what's your thing?
Pounds of weed with no blow, man, sweet lick, kick the door, man
My young nigga go run in, bare face, no mask on
And I wanna send a message but they drop the ball on my last song
First deal they try to rape a nigga, second deal, they tried to hold me back
Politics like a motherfucker, through it all a nigga back
Loving all these screwed faces, loving all these fake gaps
Nigga, I'm just getting warmed up, I ain't even pushed on the gas yet

Step into my world
Where we walk around with them things
If you get wrong we go bang
And we serious popping, we bang
Welcome to my world
Where we never sleeping with it
Keep them bank rolls and I feed it
Got it bad for them sinners
Welcome to my world
You gotta act right, talk right, walk right
Step into my world
Welcome to my world, welcome to my world
Welcome to my world

I'm in a different worldâ€¦
We go for but we still stay part of the scene
You know one side of them guns riding every car we at
We like fuck that, we bad guns, we party at
In my world I spend a fortune on care
Little niggas getting killed for the same clothes we wear
Yeah, I hear you, gold all on your watch
Where I'm from if you get caught, you get shot
Wanted hustlers, they diligent, respected
Mommas think their kids getting neglected
I seen prom queen turn molly fiends
Good college girls turned stripper bitch, dollar and a dream

Step into my world
Where we walk around with them things
If you get wrong we go bang
And we serious popping, we bang
Welcome to my world
Where we never sleeping with it
Keep them bank rolls and I feed it
Got it bad for them sinners
Welcome to my world
You gotta act right, talk right, walk right
Step into my world
Welcome to my world, welcome to my world
Step into my world
