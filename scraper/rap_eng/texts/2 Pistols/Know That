[Hook: French Montana]
Call 'em mister, never get your ho back
Hunned grands I throw that
Never get your ho back
Hunned grands I throw that
Never get your ho back
Hunned grands, I throw that
Never get your ho back
Know that, know that
Never get your ho back
Know that, know that
Never get your ho back

[Verse 1: 2 Pistols]
Coke boy before rap, it’s blood money, but you know that
Better cuff your ho, cause I snatch it bro
I’ll have her sucking dick in that maybach
They were hating on me, that payback
Keep that thang on me stay strapped
Throwing money, 10 racks, your ho fucking, asap
My swisher loud nigga, I can’t hear a thing
I lick that pussy ball like mister clean
My cup muddy boy I’m on that fuckin' lean
2 pistols, but what’s my nick name

[Hook: French Montana]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Thousand chains, fresh, she call that
One more flow back
Bullets hit you colder mister
Never get your ho back
Fuck that bitch cause steak up
All that grind, got the cake up
Get so high, might never wake up
Put it in the pot, bread to break up
Got the streets you know that
Their respect you owe that
Pay a fall, better ho, cause my niggas grow that
Put on niggas head, serving niggas cold
Colds, iced out, like you seen the …

[Hook: French Montana]

[Verse 3: 2 Pistols]
Man your ho wanna suck a nigga
Man your ho wanna fuck a nigga
I hit it then I quit it
Hasta la vista, Arnold Schwarzenegger
Semiautomatic, both pistols
I ball, you a broke nigga
Winter time, chinchilla
Wine and dine, I’m a pimp nigga
Rolex on my arm cost a whole brick
I chucked a whole bomb, then I scoop your bitch
You thought that she was at work, she was on my dick
2 pistols, but what’s my nick name
