Intro: 2 Pistols
She say, turn the lights off
I'm like no!
(This is-this is-this is)
2 Pistols, Young Joe
I like my lights low

Chorus: Young Joe
Lights down low, nice n' slow
I'mma give your body what it's fiendin' fo'
Lights down low, I'm a pro
Ain't no limitations when this love unfolds
Wanna do you over here, do you over there
Don't tell nobody the freaky moments that we share
Lights down low, oh oh low, oh oh low
Lights down low, oh oh low, oh oh low
Lights down low

Verse 1: 2 Pistols
I took a glance at the ??? it say two-thirty
DJ screamin' last call, vision blurry
She say she gon get freaky as I wan' her to be
So I took her home in the rover with me, we blowin' on trees
Down 275 shawty wide open
Goose got her loose, I reach down low, she soakin'
Wet for daddy, can i help you with that shawty
We at the masion now
Tongues touchin, caressin her body
Protection (whats next?)
Im feelin her i know she feelin me
Where we goin? extasy
Ima beast with them lights down low
Multiple positions and l-l-l-lickin fo sho

Chorus x1

Wanna do you over here
Lights down low..low low
Do you over there
Lights down low...low low

Verse 2 : 2 pistols
Lights down, face down
You now whats up
Just love makin now baby we dont ffff....
Whats that? leave that to them lames
We be poppin champagne, strawberries and whip cream
Friends that intervene?
Private things, wildest dreams come true
It ain't no limit to the things that we do
Come closer i bet i work you like a 9 to 5
If shes not satisfied i put in overtime
From behind smack smack she say thats mine
Body like a goddess angel face so you know shawty ain't never lie
Ima beast with them lights down low
Multiple positions and l-l-l-lickin fo show

\chorus x2
