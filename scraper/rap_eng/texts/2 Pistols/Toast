[Hook: Wash]
You the baddest in the spot
I see them girls hatin'
Yeah you're something that they not ohhh
Gon' bottle what you like
Shots on me since you're coming home tonight
I'd toast to that
To give you the best night of your life
I'd toast to that
Oh girl just tell me all the things that you like
I'd toast to that

[Verse 1: 2 Pistols]
Bottles on me, loud on me
Molly on me, everything here free
Introduced you to this lifestyle
You fuckin' with a young boss right now
Let your hair down baby
Tonight we goin' in
Toast to them haters
She said give her a second
Let her fix up her makeup
'cause without them haters
Probably won't focus on paper
That ass so fat she a 10 and got brains too
I bet she look good in her rings too
But i ain't here to give rings just dick boo
Won't you back back back it up and drop it move
Pussy on fleek, everything on fleek
I said climb in the ghost we gon' see
Kissin' on your boy, now she suckin' on your boy
Oooooh damn she a freak, 2 P!

[Verse 2: Mally Mall]
Pullin' up, so exclusive
Whip lookin like a spaceship
House lookin like a castle on Mario
I ain't fuckin witchu you a sorry hoe
Wasn't it just about a week ago?
Seen you lurkin on the homies from the OVO
Been around the world, same story yo
Blow it like a Cancer, Freaky like a Scorpio
I don't give a fuck about your status
Nicki baby yeah I'm fuckin with the baddest
Anything i had, i don't want you can have it
Even on a bad day, still livin lavish
It's all on me, I'll toast to that
Whole squad with me, gotta toast to that

[Hook]

[Bridge: Wash]
You a freak and I know it
That's why you gon stay till the morning
Hit the blunt then we zonin
Got them legs goin up, no makonnen
When the money start talking ain't nothin to say
50 shades of that wash you gon do what i say
Oh yeahhh
So get yo ass up on the counter
Skip the talking and the foreplay
Know i had your body feenin for hours
Now you're finally in my place
Now its time to pop it off, gon' take it off
Booty so fat, and your lips so soft
Shots on shots, gotchu feelin right
Turn the lights off, finna give you this pipe
We gon toast to that
