[Hook: Trey Songz]
Don't let his wrist game fool ya
You the deal, be my ghetto princess
Need to leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be straight without him, that's my word
And if your man can't please you, ain't real
Gon' and kick him to the curb
Need to leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be straight without him, that's my word

[Verse 1: 2 Pistols]
Leave ya man, I'm a betta look, why you stessin' on me?
Way to childish, the nigga need guidance
And I don't mind if you need time
Just as long as my number get dialed when you decide to walk out
So much stress on these shoulders
We ain't gotta fuck, I just wanna hold ya, so close
Let you know that I'm here for you
Stop cryin', I don't wanna see no tears from you

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Don't let his wrist game fool ya
You the deal, be my ghetto princess
Need to leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be straight without him, that's my word
And if your man can't please you, ain't real
Gon' and kick him to the curb
Need to leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be straight without him, that's my word

[Verse 2: 2 Pistols]
That's my word and I stand on it, take a chance on me
Start answerin' those phone calls, there homie
Move on, let's go do us
I'm thinki' 'bout the car seat in the Rover truck
Nah, I don't wanna rest nothin'
Just wanna you to know how committed I am to ya
Deep feelings for ya
I keep it 100, I'm the realest for ya

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Don't let his wrist game fool ya

Gon' and kick him to the curb
Need to leave him right where you found him
Shawty you gon' be straight without him, that's my word

[Bridge: 2 Pistols & Trey Songz]
Brand new life, sky blue iced out
Rings quart thous' tonight
Brand new life, sky blue iced out
Rings fly, you my wife
What I gotta do to make you my girl?
Take you to the hood, show you my world
Yeah I'm on my grown man, out in public, hold hands
Don't you feel better now that you took a chance?
Two seat equip, big body full equip
Hair blowin' in the wind, shawty you straight with me
