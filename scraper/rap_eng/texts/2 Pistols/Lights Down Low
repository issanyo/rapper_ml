(feat. C- Joe)
[Intro]
She's Say
Turn the lights off!
I'm like no!
This is! This is!
2 Pistols! Young Joe!
I like my Lights Low

[Chorus]
Lights Down Low!
Nice 'n slow!
I'mma' give yo' body what its fiendin fo'!
Lights Down Low!
I'mma' pro!
Ain't no limitations, when this love unfolds!
Wanna' do you over here! Do you over there!
Don't tell nobody the freaky moments that we share!
Lights Down Low! (Oh Oh Oh)
Lights Down Low! (Oh Oh Oh)
Lights Down Low!

(Verse 1)
I took a glance at the muligan it said 2:30
Dj screaming last call, vision blurry
She say she gon'e get freaky, as i wanna the best
So i took her home, in the rover with me, we blowin on tricks
Down 275, shawty wide open
Coops gotta noose, i reached down shes soakin
Wet for daddy, can i help you with that shawty?
We at the mansion now, tounge starts caressing her body
Protection (whats next?) im feeling her
I know she feeling me, way we going extacy. (oh yeah)
I'mma' beast with them lights down low, multiple positions and la-la-la-licking fo'sho

[Chorus]
Lights Down Low!
Nice 'n slow!
I'mma' give yo' body what its fiendin fo'!
Lights Down Low!
I'mma' pro!
Ain't no limitations, when this love unfolds!
Wanna' do you over here! Do you over there!
Don't tell nobody the freaky moments that we share!
Lights Down Low! (Oh Oh Oh)
Lights Down Low! (Oh Oh Oh)
Lights Down Low!

(Verse 2)
Lights down, Face down
U kno wats up, Juss love makin’ out
Baby, We dont **** (Non of dat)
Wat that, Leave that to them lames
We be poppin champagne, Strawberrys & Whip Cream
No Friends to intervene
Private things, wildest dreams come true
There ain't no limits to the things that we do
Come closers, I bet U work like a nine to five
If she’s not satisfied, I’ll put in overtime
From behind, smack-smack, she said that's mine
Body like a goddess, Angel face
And U know shorty ain't neva lie
I'mma' beast with them lights down low, multiple positions and la-la-la-licking fo'sho

[Chorus]
Lights Down Low!
Nice 'n slow!
I'mma' give yo' body what its fiendin fo'!
Lights Down Low!
I'mma' pro!
Ain't no limitations, when this love unfolds!
Wanna' do you over here! Do you over there!
Don't tell nobody the freaky moments that we share!
Lights Down Low! (Oh Oh Oh)
Lights Down Low! (Oh Oh Oh)
Lights Down Low!
