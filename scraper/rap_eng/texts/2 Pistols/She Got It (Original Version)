Excuse moi, let me talk to you for a second
Little mama so fine she got the whole squad sweatin' (DAYMN!)

Was the question that I asked
Followed by "Let me buy you a drink" (Drink)
Young boss baby, I treat you
Treat you to the finer things

Wedding ring (Nah, I'm playin')
Might light ya neck or your wrist
But you gotta ride a nice dick and, uh
Take trips with the bricks (Hey yeah)
"She got it {She got it}

Ridin' 6's while they walk
