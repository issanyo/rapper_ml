[Hook: x2]
I want all the kush, I want all the bottles
I want all the cash, I wanna fuck all the models
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all

[Verse:]
All these bad bitches in my Cedes, salute
When I leave the club straight blazin, no roof
Big power chiefin, when potatoes come through
I’m only in town for the night, snooze – you lose
Too big but I get dough, Juicy J my kin for
Trippin, trippin, trippin
Just relax and blow this kush hoe
I’m bouncing on these niggas, you a worker, pretender
Just check my shoes, Da Vinci 50 go with it
My clique full of them pimps, money makin them wips
Came a long way from the realest
Still focused off on these millions
Want it all, want it all
Whoever act a fiend, fuck yall
I’m greedy, I’m greedy
Money, pussy, good weed – I need it, need it

[Hook: x2]
I want all the kush, I want all the bottles
I want all the cash, I wanna fuck all the models
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all

[Verse:]
I got 25 model broads, we be textin
They all prayin to they god that’ll bless em
Moneyget I talk fluent, lil pimp nigga going through it
Spend 100 bands on Jordans
And I only wind when I’m recordin
Just a young nigga from Florida
Used to get it from cross the border
Can’t take enough, I want morals
Everything, everything
Money, bottles, man turn up
Dump that ass bitch, go dumb
Grab er once, throw er down
To the made niggas in here
Kush too loud, the haters I can’t hear them
And them red bottoms I’m killin em
Could’ve fucked yo bitch, I wasn’t killin er
But yo lil sister, I’m drillin er
My Rolex I like it good enough
Money stacked tall to the ceiling though
I’m ballin bitch, you can’t give a fuck
In the fast lane, take some mo bucks

(Hook x4)
I want all the kush, I want all the bottles
I want all the cash, I wanna fuck all the models
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
