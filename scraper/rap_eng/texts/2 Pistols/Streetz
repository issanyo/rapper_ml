[Hook]
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the streetz
Money over bitches
My hustle over all
Get my weight up with my hate
Then I ball 'till I fall
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the streetz
I'm from the jungle
I'm talking lions
Tigers and bears
When I keep a smile servin'
Bout no roof and no squares

[Verse 1]
Tell'em niggas I'm back, back
Tell'em niggas I'm strapped
Two pistols, ten chain
Put a red bitch on my lap
And I'm just balling
And ducking
Bloodline I'm smokin'
Now on the reggie
You ain't hittin' mine
You chokin'
50 bands in Louie
Get the check, run through it
They talk about it
But I do it
No shit thing, it's true
We eating till I better ate
I'm selling dimes, I'm selling weight
That time, we gonna set the record straight
Big money, since 08
I'll get y'all on my phone
Money on my door
Tell em leave me alone
She fucking up my presidence
She ain't got no etiquette
Mad? I won't give a dick
I'm busy bitch, tryna get my pockets fat like elephants
Young Buster is in it
... To own two millie
Jumpin' out that Bentley
Ride, who? Forget it
I'm a street nigga, I'm a street nigga
I'm a street nigga, don't think they hear me

[Hook]
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the streetz
Money over bitches
My hustle over all
Get my weight up with my hate
Then I ball 'till I fall
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the streetz
I'm from the jungle
I'm talking lions
Tigers and bears
When I keep a smile servin'
Bout no roof and no squares

[Verse 2]
First I lock my block
Then I lock my city
Once I lock my state
I do the whole world
Do you feel me?
I've got platinum plex on my wall
Halley Berry in my jaws
Joldy, fauldy
All I know is...
Fat ate but 40
Two chrome bought 40'
With a blonde bitch on my leg
Doin' the dance role in Ferarri
Forgive me, Lord, I'm sorry
But I gotta shit on her regardless
For a hard time I was doin' bad
And niggas thought it was funny
Roll it on my arm
100 karat, my charm
Shout out on them like armor all
Just picked up a new...

[Hook]
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the streetz
Money over bitches
My hustle over all
Get my weight up with my hate
Then I ball 'till I fall
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the street, street
I'm from the streetz
I'm from the jungle
I'm talking lions
Tigers and bears
When I keep a smile servin'
Bout no roof and no squares
