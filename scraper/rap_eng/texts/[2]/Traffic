[Intro]
Giving out free smoke, hope he got lungs
Mid life riding 'round with them drums
Caught him in traffic, that nigga, he done
You know how we livin’ man
Young nigga sliding in free cars
Riding 'round town, tryna catch these niggas for fun

[Verse 1]
I don't wan’ see them breathe
Percs on 'em, can't breathe
Really came from the street
Niggas tryna act like me
Niggas don't lie to me
Nigga, you can't be me (Trapnanana)
MAC, it got a shoe string
I'ma shoot the three

[Hook]
Fuck with niggas where I come from
Nigga, you acting like a bum
I don't fuck with none of these niggas
Nigga, you better watch your tongue
Chopper, it's gon’ hit you up
Chopper, it’s gon' hit for fun
Young niggas, sliding in free cars
Riding ’round town, tryna catch these niggas for fun
OG told me I'm the one
Don't got no kids, but these niggas my sons
Giving out free smoke, hope he got lungs
Mid lights, riding round with them drums
Caught him in traffic, that nigga, he done
Treat everyday like it's the last one
My young nigga called, said he caught one
Yeah, we hopping out for fun

[Verse 2]
They tryna hit us with the R.I.C.O
Gotta keep a stick everywhere we go
Hop out with the Drac, yeah, that’s just a free throw
Sleeping with demons, nobody else see though
They hating on me, but they can't compete though
Playing with bowls up the way with Ledo
Nigga, we in to get more money
Cars, clothes
You can keep the hoes, I hang with the bros
Got the chopper and it fold, we gon' let you know
These niggas ain't seen what I seen
These niggas ain't did what I did
Free Doubleback and Homicide Boys
Man, they up doing a bid
Let some more shots out the Glock
I ain't never gon' stop, I ain't never gon' stop
That's some more shots out the A-R
We gon' let off 'till your face pop
We gon' knock all your face off
Niggas, they playing softball
I'm in the trenches playing hardball
I gotta go everywhere with the dog

[Hook]
Fuck with niggas where I come from
Nigga, you acting like a bum
I don't fuck with none of these niggas
Nigga, you better watch your tongue
Chopper, it's gon hit you up
Chopper, it's gon hit for fun
Young niggas, sliding in free cars
Riding 'round town, tryna catch these niggas for fun
OG told me I'm the one
Don't got no kids, but these niggas my sons
Giving out free smoke, hope he got lungs
Mid life, riding round with them drums
Caught him in traffic, that nigga, he done
Treat everyday like it's the last one
My young nigga called, said he caught one
Yeah, we hopping out for fun
