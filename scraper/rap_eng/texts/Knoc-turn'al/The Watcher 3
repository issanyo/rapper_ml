[Intro]
Yeah... Uh!
Lil Drift
Take three
Yo!

[Verse 1]
Once more, yeah I’m back on the map
I’m ready to spit another verse for this collection of tracks
Y’all don’t really know why I do this crap
Why I spit on beats and why I shit on raps
Why I flow in a rhythm you ain’t ever heard
Manipulate the English language and I twist every word
Why I flow in metaphors that you don’t comprehend
So you say my rhymes are simple when really you’re just lame
Nosy ass fucks, keep your nose out of my business
My name out your mouth, and your eyes off of my riches
I’m a veteran in the game, you just a new recruit
That’s why you’re after my rhymes like a hot pursuit
I was schoolin kids when my flow was still off
So sick, I could take you out with only one cough
I don’t affiliate with half of these actors
Cuz they’re a talentless bunch that call themselves “rappers”
The other half a bunch of no good liars
Bragging about money and about being suppliers
When they can’t even pay their own damn light bill
Sleeping on the floor and can’t wake up from that nightmare
I’m The Watcher of the game, put out their misery
I been dominating rhymes since 2003
I got stripes like Cincinnati
And to stop me, I guess you have to try and kill me
Or something, cuz my reign in the game will never cease
I lay rappers out like my Nikes when they crease
Toe tag and body bag whenever they want peace
Because instead of peace, I pull out a piece
Hip-Hop is unhealthy, it’s become obese
I feel it slowly falling apart, piece by piece
The decrease of intelligence is extravagant
Because these idiots’ numbers are set to increase
What I write might be the best you’ve ever heard
Depending on who you ask and nowadays what’s preferred
Don’t pretend to be the best, I could never act
I just vent on paper and let it flow in raps
Royaltie about to show you what’s really good
Don’t get it twisted, just get it understood
It’s the watcher

[Hook] (Truth Hurts)
I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw, ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before
People I used to know, just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)
