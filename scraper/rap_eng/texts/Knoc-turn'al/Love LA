West Coast! (12x)
If you with it, then I'm with it
We can do it in a minute
Open up and let me hit it
Big hips I'm workin with it

Born and raised, that's why I love LA

Got my life then I'ma live it
Need some money, I'ma get it
Shoot first then get a grip
That's about how Cali live it
Lookin for a super chicken
I can give a super dick in
Her man don't even know she missin everyday
Chrome 100 spoke spinnin, Glocks spittin, Hennesy sippin
Wanna party I ain't trippin

Born and raised, that's why I love LA

[Knoc-Turn'Al - Chorus]

I'm gone keep switchin lanes, uh huh

You know there ain't a damn thing changed
You pop lock, we pop Glocks
I just came to have some fun and get drunk in the club I came to party
Born and raised, that's why I love LA

Spit flame, got the rap game in a choke hold
Hoppin lo lo's on dayton danes in mo mo's

Born and raised, that's why I love LA

Ain't no place like home

Born and raised, that's why I love LA

[Knoc-Turn'Al - Chorus (2x)]
I'm gone keep dippin, yeah

Born and raised, that's why I love LA
