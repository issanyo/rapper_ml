Do you have any idea what I'm about to do to the rap game
Ain't shit changed, I'ma do my thang
If you know hustle game don't stop
It ain't about fame, it ain't about glory
It's about niggas grindin' on the block
Ain't shit changed, I'ma do my thang
If you know hustle game don't stop
It ain't about fame, it ain't about glory
It's about niggas grindin' on the block
