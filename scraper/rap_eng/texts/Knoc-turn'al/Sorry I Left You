[Chorus: Knoc-turn'al]
We all know I love the Westcoast
I'm sorry that I left you babe
Even though I stayed on the go
I really really missed you babe

We all know I love the Westcoast
I'm sorry that I left you babe
Even though I stayed on the go
I still represent the Westcoast babe

[Verse 1: Knoc-Turn'al]
OK I'll admit, I got lazy
Cause I ain't like these other suckers Dre paid me
The reason why you know my name is Dre made me
I got a fly ass house, man that shits crazy
I got a fly ass wife, life and two babies
And if the price is right a label will pay me
Turn down the lights tonight the mic can't tame me
Oh and it feels good to be back at home
Kicking ass and taking names I'm never alone
Taking out the trash leave some radio space
How you do what you do Knoc, I don't know its God's grace
He made me leave MCs to pick up they face
I like to live summer breeze in summer breezes place
I like a bitch to shop and hustle dressed in all lace
I came back to straighten it out it's Knoc-Turn'al
And this is what I do

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Knoc-Turn'al]
I gave the West a bad name, I'm here to back clean up
When I say don't be playing don't be playing with deez nuts
And if I ever gave you something nigga then re up
And if I ain't never gave you nothing then so what
Help me help you get something and man up
Who you talking slick to fronting outlandishly
We go to war who gonna outlast this beast
Oh and it feels good to be back at home
Get them gangstas in your home girls on the phone
Hustlers and the pimps Knoc-Turn'als back home
All that really matters is who hosting your spatter
Everyone I meet they give me a pussy platter
I walk by she latches on, I don't have to grab her
And you in the club acting just like Jack the Ripper
Don't control your hoe just tip her
Oh and it feels good to be back at home

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Knoc-Turn'al]
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way that you love my music and all I know
I've been riding for way to long, been riding for way to long

[Verse 3: Knoc-turn'al]
They say my voice raspy, I've been hitting the bong
And I can never quite pass up a bitch in a thong
I could do this all night long a 5th of Hennessy a OZ
I won't go home I feel good my bank roll is fat
Matter fact where the party at?
I'm OG as hulk hogan at a wrestling match
I've been here my 1st car was a 72 'lac
I came from a long generation of true macs
If you grew up in the hood you could feel this
And if you got up out of the hood and you hood rich so I
Do what I got to do

[Chorus]
