[Intro: Phish] x2
What's the difference between me and you

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils
Got down to business; but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga
I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cause you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit'chu
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you
And that's just being real wit'chu
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these crab-ass niggas I first drew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they Ruthless
Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speaking your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

[Hook: Phish] x2
What's the difference between me and you
You talk a good one
But you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

[Verse 2: Hittman]
The difference is: I don't care
Can't you tell it by my rigid stare?
I'm legendary, get you open like a Frigidaire
More despair, your style's dead as Fred Astaire
You need medicare, security blanket and a fucking teddy bear
Awh yeah, awh yeah
Is your expression when you eyewitness a session
Vocal pitch making impressions like Jerry Butler
Stupid fucker, I will cut ya
Doing a sucka's such a tragedy, I'll run you raggedy like Ann
You'll kick the pink can like a faggoty man
New styles, I usually keep clandestine
Like files of semen found in J. Edgar Hoover's intestines
No question
But keep that on the low low, Falana slow mo
When puffing marijuana couldn't get the time of day
Now I'm fucking nigga's Mommas
Drama's still part of my dietary
Hit hard like Singletary
Kill your daughter, bust her cherry

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Aight, hold up hold up
Stop the beat a minute
I got somethin' to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fucking weed is in me
(What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dog
I got your motherfucking back (right) just know this shit

[Dr. Dre]
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one nigga
Let's blow this bitch

[Eminem]
I mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed - whose throat is it?

[Dr. Dre]
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch
I'll show you where the ocean is

[Eminem]
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (hi)
Then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up
Mucus in hot water
That's for trying to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us
We can start at the penis
Or we can scream
"I Just Don't Give a Fuck," and see who means it

[Hook]
