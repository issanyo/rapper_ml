Herm√®s, Lanvon, Louis Vuitton, belle maison and my Dior arms
Maintenant to live papillon so get your pap-pap-pap-pap papping on
Promised my fans I'd sound sick on any motherfucking riddim I'm rapping on
Tell the world I rep Disturbing London, down by the rivers of Babylon
Place your bet, major threat, might take the deck, I break necks, what did they expect?
Aim for head, same address from the A to Z, them dumb rappers best pay respect
They're all imbeciles, from day one I've been about principle
I'm just living out my destiny, Kelly Rowland said I'm invincible
Reminiscing times I couldn't afford a ride, I had a driving license
See them bredders go in cars, they're provisionals
I used to go to sleep miserable, now every moment in my life unmissable
Ride first class on that Eurostar, I'm all about the pounds and the Euro, star
Act up nigga, think you're a star, Yardies, Igbos and Yorubas
Handle pain, it's a brand new chapter and a day
South France money, I'm Saint-Tro-paid, tweets from a million fans a day
I've seen life go from the bad to the good, now I'm comfortable
Now when Rob D played Al Capone, that's how a nigga feel untouchable
