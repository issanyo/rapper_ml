[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yes, ah, yo
Yeah, ready for the summer, girl, your hair look killer
See your batty getting bigger but your waist looks slimmer
And I hope I'm still with you when your hair get thinner
I ain't gotta work it out, I know I'm on to a winner
And I love it when I see you sing a song in the mirror
When you play your favourite records where there ain't no filler
Chicky-cha chicky-chicky-cha, Sade, J Dilla
Now I'm on the right track, went from a train to a limo
Now we on the right track (right track), yeah (right track)
Used to know me back in college, now I got it like that
Could've gotten sidetracked, now I'm back on my feet
If I hadn't achieved, would you pack up and leave?
Now you're scratchin' on me like we're Adam and Eve
Playing remix to Ignition in the back of the Jeep, ah
She like the hook but she don't know the verse
She know I love her even if I never say the words

[Hook: Jess Glynne + (Tinie Tempah)]
You were something I can't replace
You made my heart work (aha)
You make me stronger (aha)
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
You were something I can't replace
You made my heart work (aha)
You make me stronger (aha)
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go

[Post-Hook: Jess Glynne]
Oh-oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh oh oh, go-oh-oh oh oh
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
Oh-oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh oh oh, go-oh-oh oh oh
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, yeah
Livin' in a bubble, we ain't struggling in life
Ready for your trouble and a couple of fights
Why don't you stay over here and keep me up in the night
And when you're comin' in here, I'll do it just like you like
Girl I'm ready for your lovin', girl I keep on falling
You my lucky number that I keep on calling
Wanna never let me go, she said she fed up of tourin'
Because I kiss her in the night and I then leave in the mornin'
I tell her one, already know she the one
She 22, we in Le Fontainebleau
And when she free, you know she call on me
And then I make her take it off and pull it all on me
Playin' in the sheets, don't sleep tonight
Playin' R. Kelly, I Believe I Can Fly, yeah
She like the hook but she don't know the verse
She know I love her even if I never say the words

[Hook: Jess Glynne + (Tinie Tempah)]
You were something I can't replace
You made my heart work (aha)
You make me stronger (aha)
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
You were something I can't replace
You made my heart work (aha)
You make me stronger (aha)
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go

[Post-Hook: Jess Glynne + (Tinie Tempah)]
Oh-oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh oh oh, go-oh-oh oh oh
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
Oh-oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh oh oh (no I don't wanna let you go), go-oh-oh oh oh
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go

[Bridge: Tinie Tempah & Jess Glynne]
Yo, oi my size, I see you're quite shy
Guess I'm a sucker for those nice eyes
I ain't in it for the money or the fame
I'm the one that all the honeys couldn't tame, yo I changed
Oh no, you make my heart work
You make me stronger
You know I changed
This thing we have
It can't be bought or sold, now

[Hook: Jess Glynne + (Tinie Tempah)]
You were something I can't replace (yeah)
You made my heart work (aha)
You make me stronger (makin' me strong)
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
You were something I can't replace
You made my heart work (aha)
You make me stronger
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go

[Post-Hook: Jess Glynne + (Tinie Tempah)]
Oh-oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh oh oh (no I don't wanna let you go), go-oh-oh oh oh
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go (you already know)
Oh-oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh oh oh (no I don't wanna let you go), go-oh-oh oh oh (no I don't wanna let you go)
I'm not letting go, I'm not letting go
