(Verse 1: Tinie Tempah)
Blah, Yeah, Simple
Honey, I'm a fine boy, no pimples
I done deja-vu I done dingwalls
And fuckin everybody wants me on their single
My mum 44 years with no wrinkles
I got a hundred thousand on me I can sprinkle
All year my house covered in tinsel
I gone pop and I won't stop Pringles yeah

(Pre Chorus: Tinie Tempah & Vanya Taylor)
So involved in this moment, I can't let it go
Tick tock, check my Roley wrist watch
Fuck how much a drink costs, we about to kick off like
It's outrageous and sophisticated, it's all in the air
The big boss, make em jump like Kriss Kross
Girl you better turn me on cos I'm about to switch off

(Chorus: Tinie Tempah & Vanya Taylor)
I can't explain it (cool)
But you're gonna love this (yes)
So crazy outrageous (big)
Simply unstoppable (fresh)

I can't explain it (cool)
But you're gonna love this (yes)
So crazy outrageous (big)
Simply unstoppable (fresh)

(Verse 2: Tinie Tempah)
I think I should remind em
I'm about to clean up like a Dyson
'Cause I just say how it is like Simon
I like the taste of alcohol I got wine gums
I don't ever wanna hear another siren
Them highrises can block your horizon
Disturbing London is the city that I'm from
Where if we like the tune, we make the DJ rewind em yeah

(Pre Chorus: Tinie Tempah & Vanya Taylor)
So involved in this moment, i can't let it go
Tik tok, check my Roley wrist watch
Fuck how much a drink cost, we about to kick off like
It's outrageous and so soo phisticated it's all in the air

The big boss, make em jump like Kriss Kross
Girl you better turn me on cos I'm about to switch off

(Chorus: Tinie Tempah & Vanya Taylor)
I can't explain it (cool)
But you're gonna love this (yes)
So crazy outrageous (big)
Simply unstoppable (fresh)

I can't explain it (cool)
But you're gonna love this (yes)
So crazy outrageous (big)
Simply unstoppable (fresh)

(Verse 3: Tinie Tempah)
Yeah, I betta make em say Oooh
Some Alize and some Grey Goose
I said NO to like 6 or 7 labels
I used to sit next to Rachel in Saint Paul's
My fans are crazy with stencils and staples
I came to cause a bit of chaos and to break rules
If it ain't me, it ain't cool
Oi baby, bring another bottle to the table

(Chorus: Tinie Tempah & Vanya Taylor)
I can't explain it (cool)
But you're gonna love this (yes)
So crazy outrageous (big)
Simply unstoppable (fresh)

I can't explain it (cool)
But you're gonna love this (yes)
So crazy outrageous (big)
Simply unstoppable (fresh)

(Outro: Tinie Tempah)
Cool
Yes
Big
Fresh
