Coming for you rappers if you ready or not
Girl, I offload, my album cover look like a rough coll
Man are breaking even with a couple of odd notes
My niggas out in Paris stuck home and in Moscow
I used to ride a Vauxhall, now I'm in a mansion
Only Jenny from the block own hustler ambition
Will I make it to the top? Will I be stopped? Well only God knows
Still don't know you niggas like you flopped a knock knock joke
Knock knock, who's there? Who, who's there? You
Don't make me yell LMFAO like Redfoo
I never clear a rumour up if there's truth
I can't decide which AP I wear too, ooh
Where were you when I was looking for a come-up?
In the studio a one-up, I was rapping till the sun up
When I needed validation, rappers wouldn't put their thumb up, uh
Took the leap of faith with no run-up, uh
I ain't sincere man, I say "wish you was here"
Heard these rappers had an issue, heard the issue was clear
Hope you made a bit of money in your little careers
You man ain't relevant no more, the fans ain't missed you for years
You should mature your sound, you're all small clowns
The bigger they are, the harder they all fall down
Enormous arenas when I tour your town
And I ain't even the teeth but I'm coming for your crown
Done
