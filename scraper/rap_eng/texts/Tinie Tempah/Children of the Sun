[Hook: John Martin]
Lay down your head, you're not alone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow
We are the children of the sun
That's all you need to know
Lay down your head, you're not alone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow
We are the children of the sun
That's all you need to know

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Bitch I'm a moonwalker like Michael, skywalk all over my rivals
Both hands on that Bible bitch, I'm next in line for that title
A nigga had nothing to do, I was idle, man was in the studio with Taio
Now we’re climbing high, we ain’t on no kill a man giro
And they’re panicking, they don't really know what's happening
Now we've got our clothes on a mannequin, we don't need no comparison
I overdosed on extravagance, we went for gold and got platinum
I told my bro to get an ambulance cause I caught a cold and went spaz on them
How can home be where the heart is when your shadow even fucking leaves you when you are in darkness?
Still get stopped by Sergeant Pepper, looking for that Ziggy Stardust
After a lifetime of regret, I'm just looking for some answers

[Hook: John Martin]
Lay down your head, you're not alone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow
We are the children of the sun
That's all you need to know
Lay down your head, you're not alone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow
We are the children of the sun
That's all you need to know

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
I had opportunity at my window, wise words on my Kindle
Disturbing London, we raised the bar whilst your team was stuck in limbo
Like Freddie, Bruno and Ringo, I saw the signs and symbols
With that top down on my yellow ride, let bitches hate on my bimbo
I'm yards away from that milestone, international dial tone
Put me through Amaro when you Instagram on your iPhone
From yellow bricks to them brown stones, I ring bells, I'm household
Look at all the rappers we outsold so (shh) keep your mouth closed, yeah
How did I become so jaded? Maybe all these insecurities are making me feel naked
Feel like Harry did in Vegas, had my privacy invaded
That's a liberty a pity, the epitome of what fame is
Priest up in my parish, keep on putting me in their prayers
Swear I'd never sell my soul, my pride and dignity is too major, yeah
We rarely ever get those second chances
After a lifetime of regret, I'm just looking for some answers

[Hook: John Martin]
Lay down your head, you're not alone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow
We are the children of the sun
That's all you need to know
Lay down your head, you're not alone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow
We are the children of the sun
That's all you need to know

[Bridge: Tinie Tempah]
Looking for a light that can outshine the sun
I know one day our time will come
Bought a camera to capture these cinematic nights
Still don't satisfy my appetite for this lavish life
Tell me, doctor, am I fit for all these flashing lights?
Like Michael said, it doesn't matter if you're black or white
Look at the colours that's under the sun above us
All we have is each other, in case you happen to wonder
Let's go

[Hook: John Martin]
Lay down your head, you're not alone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow
We are the children of the sun
That's all you need to know
Lay down your head, you're not alone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow
We are the children of the sun
That's all you need to know
