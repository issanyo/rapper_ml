[Verse 1 - Tinie Tempah]
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our six star
The Hotel Cabana, a world full of drama
Interior designed by Dolce & Gabbana
Hotel Cabana, where you check out 'fore you check in to our beds
And I guess you’ll write their checks out without checking
Double rooms with hammocks in, masquerades and mannequins
Discounts for kids now and anyone who hasn’t sinned
Yea, but beware of the piranhas
And surveillance from the cameras while you’re wearing your Havanas in

[Hook - Emeli Sandé]
Hotel Cabana, where the sleepless kids live
Dancing with fire, look what young money did
Confetti on their heads, stranger in my beds
Cabana
Hotel Cabana, where the curious go
Jump in the sauna, let the bad habits grow
Oh oh dancing on the edge
Hope it never ends in Cabana

[Verse 2 - Tinie Tempah]
Let me take you on a journey through these eternal corridors
Polished floors, no third, no seventh or eleventh floor
Founded and built up on a premise of a clever thought
Witness an experience of something unforgettable
Hotel Cabana, José Hosanna
There are cloaks and daggers
There are snakes and ladders yeah
Lost souls roaming round like night owls
So make sure the doors are locked before you turn the lights out
