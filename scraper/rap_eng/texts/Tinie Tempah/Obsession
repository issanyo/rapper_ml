[Verse 1]
I think my reflection is relatively jealous of me, that's all
Twittering on my Apple, hoping I don't get hassled
Before I reached my goal, loads of people had to be tackled
I don't jump on anybody's bandwagon or saddle
I'm X-rated, I'm adult, this ain't the Disney channel
I'm hotter than a candlewick, I'm fire
Closer to everything I desire
Cause I don't listen to doubt, doubt is a liar
Stop actin' like a bitch, don't be Mrs. Doubtfire
Ain't no get no flyer fam I'm on the cloud higher, hiya, hiya, hiya!
Different vehicles same tyres
I turn quiet into riot, listen to my silence

[Hook]
This is like a curse, this is like a blessin'
I can hear your voice, I can feel your presence
You keep me confused, you keep me guessin'
But I'm back for seconds, it's an obsession
It's an obsession
It's an obsession
This is like a curse this is like a blessin'
But I'm back for seconds, it's an obsession

[Verse 2]
P.O.M me, her mill bringin' the medley
Hot MC over any, I'm cold, cold as February
Repress my oldest memories, I hoovered them with a Henry
Now they're gone, the no longer exist, you get me?
I'm standin' with a Remy and a bank roll full of twenties
Talkin' to somethin' sexy, I'mma hit it if she lets me
Don't judge me til you've read me
Cause 9 times outta 10, I don't even get me
But I'm ready, or not, hear I come
Wherever you hide, I bet you I'mma find ya
I am not a skateboarder, but I'mma grind
I turn quiet into riot, listen to my silence

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Obsessions, the kid with lots of questions
Take take note, life is just a long lesson
My Daddy was present, but sometimes forgot my presents
Like when I was 7 (sigh)
Helicopters revvin', posh weddings
One well expensive watch, yachts, everything
I'm on leggy blondes who put on wedding rings
But after one heavy drink are on anything
So while they make me feel so used for that sued for
Thoughts racin' through my mind like a new Porsche with the roof off
Every single time I rhyme, it's science
I turn quiet into riot, listen to my silence

[Hook]
