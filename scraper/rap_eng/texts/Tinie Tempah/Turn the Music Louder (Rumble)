Yeah, yeah, yo

Top five, no less
So right, I just flex
She can't get me out of her head
So, ya'wanna hear TT on the KDA with the Katy B
And that's it, oh yeah
Ain't no one left
Rumble, go hard, no rest, c'mon

[Chorus: Katy B & Tinie Tempah]
You got me feeling for your power
Turn the music louder, let me feel it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Rumble, go hard, no rest, c'mon
You got me feeling for your power
Turn the music louder, let me feel it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, T T like a twister
Spin down, might put it on your sister
Got swag like a hipster
Give me girls with the lips ya
What a face, what a mixture
Bare likes when I'm lookin' at your Insta
What, last night was a picture
In the pool getting busy with the mixer

[Pre-Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
So right, so fresh
Top five, no less
So right, I just flex
She can't get me out of her head
They wanna hear TT on the KDA with the Katy B
And that's it, oh yeah
Ain't no one left
Rumble, go hard, no rest, c'mon

[Chorus: Katy B & Tinie Tempah]
You got me feeling for your power
Turn the music louder, let me feel it

Got me knocking down your door
You know how to take me higher

[Chorus: Katy B & Tinie Tempah]
You got me feeling for your power
Turn the music louder, let me feel it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Rumble, go hard, no rest, c'mon

[Bridge: Katy B]
E-oh-e-oh
You got me feeling like, e-oh-e-oh
Something just ain't right, e-oh-e-oh
Why did I let you in, e-oh-e-oh
And let the this all begin, e-oh-e-oh
I wish I could forget, e-oh-e-oh
The day that we first met, e-oh-e-oh
And now it's blowing up, e-oh-e-oh
Still I can't get enough
Oh oh yeah baby
Do you know?
Do you know what you're doing, what you're doing?
Oh baby, let me go

[Chorus: Katy B & Tinie Tempah]
You got me feeling for your power
Turn the music louder, let me feel it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Rumble, go hard, no rest, c'mon
You got me feeling for your power
Turn the music louder, let me feel it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Katy B]
Keep on coming back for more
Got me knocking down your door
You know how to take me higher
You got me feeling for your power
Turn the music louder, let me feel it
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
