[Hook]
They know something special's happening
They know something special's happening
2010, they were chart toppers
2020, they'll be battling
Always remind 'em that I'm African
Please don't ask me 'bout that crap again
Asian tings at the gathering
Swear my album's going platinum

They know something special's happening

Always remind 'em that I'm African
Please don't ask me 'bout that crap again
Asian tings at the gathering
Swear my album's going platinum

[Verse]
Heard they're tryna take a shot at me
I might have to take a stab at them
Side chick tried front on me
Let me hit it from the back again
Friends say that I'm back again
The ends say that I'm back again
My sensei say I'm back again
They know something special's happening
Yeah, I've got a lot of actor friends, I ain't got a lot of rapper friends
I just always sense the jealousy, even from these niggas' management
'Cause I'm fresher than a mannequin
Your last banger was an accident
I can see these haters panicking
They know something special's happening
Your whole setup is embarrassing
The whole city is what I'm carrying
Lost touch with a ting I used to link
I heard she went to jail for trafficking
Growing up, daddy never put the time in
Never told him I was mad at him
Left me feeling like I'm Anakin
Lamborghini in the garrison
Two Ferraris in a new favela
I've been riding with the same old crew forever
Flying private, tell the pilot "choose the weather"
Sunset, tryna juice a Jenner
Sunset like I'm Juicy J
I was only doing two a day
Now I'm doing twenty-two a day
My young G's twenty-two today
They know something special's happening
They know something special's happening
Oriental with the Mandarin
Journey Mercy when I'm travelling
Lord have mercy on these fuckboys
Ain't no manners for these sluts boy
2010, they were chart-toppers
2020, now their stuff's void
