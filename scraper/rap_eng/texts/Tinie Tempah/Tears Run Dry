[Intro: Sway Clarke II]
There’s nothing to borrow
There’s no more regrets
Your shadows I follow
But it’s like no one's there

[Hook: Sway Clarke II]
But my tears run dry
But my tears run dry
Oh my fields won't die
When you're not there
So I go

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Head first into your puddle of tears
Heart first into the tunnel of fear
Had your very first son at 21
Only old enough to be my mum by a couple of years
Cuddled all of your kids
Soon you’ll be cuddling theirs
And we always hear our names when you mumble your prayers
Remember when you said get a job, pick another career?
But fuck that shit, we're to humble to care yeah
Maybe it's God disguising a blessing
The truth can be hard to swallow, should I reply to these questions?
I’m stuck in the fucking middle on either side of the fences
Of all this blinding and effing, just drive me down to my session
This a mid-life crisis, is this some kind of depression?
Like a substitute teacher, I wanna teach you a lesson, ah
I think we should live and just let it die
I’ll just put on my fucking shades to hide the pain in my eyes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Standing in front of mirrors that make me look best
Rolling on something special to make me forget
Mum and Daddy came to this country and gave me the best
But all the money in the world ain’t repaying the debt
After taking a cheque, my girl got impatient and left
Still have a Damier Canvas, case of the ex
She sending me the sort of things you don’t say in a text
I won't even listen to this song cause it makes me depressed
Cause I didn’t ever do anything to hurt you
Feels like I don’t have anybody to turn to
You were the only woman I let into my circle
Closer than Celie and Nettie in The Color Purple
Saw her the other day, she said she’s going to nurse school
Gave me her BBM and said we should keep it virtual
But I think we should just live and just let it die
I’ll just put on my fucking shades and pretend everything’s fine

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
They said I used to have it, guess I got it back
They said I fucking lost it, guess I got it back
The pot can’t call the kettle black
Here’s a double shot of pride, swallow that
Gave your sister my number if you ever wanna chat
Heard she gave it you, you never even hollered back
Said there was too much on your plate but it wasn’t that
You was like an email with a file, you just got attached
Read your article and didn’t even need to diss you
Cover shoot, I hope they put you on a decent issue
And tell your girl I said mwah, ciao and bisou bisou
She was on my tour bus for a month and didn’t even miss you
After the shit we did it's crazy even if she kiss you
Here’s some aloe vera Kleenex if you need a tissue
I think we should live and just let it die
I’ll just put on my fucking shades and pretend everything's fine

[Hook]

[Bridge: Tinie Tempah x2]
They said I used to have it, guess I got it back
They said I fucking lost it, guess I got it back
The pot can't call the kettle black
Here’s a double shot of pride, swallow that
