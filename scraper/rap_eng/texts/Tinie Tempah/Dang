I look in my closet like "who stock i'm boostin' today?"
Who bitch am I making blue in the face?
Have I gotten cruel in a waaaaayyy? (Yeah)
But I whip that coupe anyway
And my jeweler like "girl what you doing today?"
I'm like "Rodney just got his computer today, more than likely we 'bout to go stupid today", yeah
Plus I'm cool anyway
I don't say what I do but I do what I say
And listen, when I said I wasn’t the same, I was talking bout who I’ve been banging
