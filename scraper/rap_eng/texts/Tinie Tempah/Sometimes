[Intro: G FrSH]
I think about you sometimes (x6)

[Verse 1: G FrSH]
Girl I can't lie, I think about you sometimes
I, I think about you sometimes
I hope that's alright, cause I remember them times
I, yeah I remember them times
Chillin' outside, doin' nothin' while the sun shine
I, watchin' it from cloud nine
Girl I can't lie, I think about you sometimes

[Verse 2: G FrSH]
But girl I can't lie
Now I feel like the sky
Lettin' all these birds fly by
Cause they ain't you and I
Nah they ain't you and I
Nah they ain't you and I
But girl I can't lie
I don't miss those nights
When something's wrong and you say am I alright?
As the days go by
We found the good goodbye

[Hook: G FrSH]
But girl I can't lie
I think about you sometimes
Girl I can't lie
I think about you sometimes
Girl I can't lie
I think about you sometimes, I
Girl I can't lie
I think about you sometimes
But girl I can't lie

[Verse 3: G FrSH]
See how you stay so fly
Couldn't you stay just mine?
And I know I should've tried
Couldn't control my pride
But was it him or I?
Cause I paid the price
Now I sit and watch on the side
Pretending everything is fine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: G FrSH]

[Hook]

[Bridge: G FrSH] (x4)
I wonder if we make it (baby, baby)
I wonder if we make it, now

[Hook]

[Verse 4: G FrSH]
Cause I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna go down that, road
Cause if I holler
If I holler, if I holler
If I holler you be at my, door
Reminiscing over ros√©
Start diggin' up old shit
Conversatin' bout new shit
I probably fuck you on a one away
But you try and make it exclusive
Then I start making excuses
Cuh I'm happy with my new chick
She kinda remind me of you in some ways
Maybe that's the reason I've been thinkin' bout you some days
Sometimes, girl I can't lie
I be checkin' if you're talkin' bout me on your timeline
Thinkin' should I DM?

[Verse 5: Tinie Tempah]
Then I wonder what you're doin' with him on your weekend
But I'm way too shallow to be in the deep end
Can't pretend it wasn't too official
Yeah, can't pretend we wasn't superficial
We used to kick of every single time you blew a whistle
Yeah, when all you wanted was a new initial
Yeah, eye on you, we started talkin' at the Q the Q Awards
Were not a cue, she knew exactly what I do, whoo
The relationship grew and grew
Old souls, feelin' new
Built up a foundation off a friendship and trust
We was always fallin' higher, i still remember the buzz
People rarely stare at life the same perspective as us
Started off as friends but you was tempted to fuck
And then you gave me all your love, which in the end was too much
Girl I was only 25, cause I was feelin' too rushed
Yeah, I should've listened to the advice
The shit was bad mine, for brag rights
You wanted that guy, the rap guy
While I was making bangers, you wanted Drake and Rihanna
She wanted Kanye and Kim, Khloe and French Montana
Had me caught up in your world, it felt like nothin' else mattered
Started hangin' out with Ellie less and Lianne La Havas
When it's Christmas I know I won't get no hamper from Santa
I hope and pray that everything is good with your grandma, I swear
Funny how someone with real true loving
Can meddle with your hear until you soon feel nothing
Searching for that feelin' that's as good as your voice
But all those insecurities just meant you couldn't rejoice
Couple holidays that we just couldn't enjoy
Made me start to question you was good for the boy, boy
And girl I can't lie
I don't know if it's ego, I don't know if it's pride
But I don't wanna see no other nigga by your side
No I don't wanna see no other nigga by your side
And even as we break up, knowing where this could take us
I contemplate you dating, irritating imitators
Do you still think about me when you wake up?
Am I still the reason why you wear your make-up? yeah
Unanswered questions to one of my biggest lessons
My purgatory before I made it to heaven
But if I ask, would you take me back in a second?
Girl that shit depressin', the way you keep me guessin'
I found a bigger blessin', baby I ain't even stressin'
But we can be mature and both be at each other's weddings
I can't lie, I play your track in the house
And every time I hear your voice, it made me happy and proud
I'm, settlin' down, I ain't a daddy for now
But girl I'm jamming, I ain't bangin' out, I'm hangin' around
But every time you do a show, I'm at the back of your crowd
Singing the ones about me, that's why I'm clappin' so loud
I'll, always respect you girl I won't ever forget you
Whatever will be will be, I guess it just wasn't meant to, yeah
Least we can say that we tried
And I'm happy, both our names in the sky
But girl I can't lie

[Outro]
Girl I can't lie
I think about you sometimes
