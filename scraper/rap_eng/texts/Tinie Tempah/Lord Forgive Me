[Pre-Hook: Konan]
I hope The Lord forgives me
Eyes low blowing trees, I hope The Lord forgives me
White girl from overseas, I hope The Lord forgive me
She wants that Mike GLC, I hope The Lord forgives me

[Hook: Konan x4]
Hope the lord forgives me
Hope the lord forgives me (Oh Lord)

[Verse 1: Krept]
I'm fucked completely
I dare man say we ain't the truth
When I see them line up to see me
Think that I've come a long way from a queue
Make man bleed if act like a wrong'un
I can have a African yout' blood clotting
Stuck up in the ghetto when them robbers are plotting, it's popping, I love 'em, drop em if there honestly shotting
Them nerds try'na act goonie
Tell him come here, he be like, who me?
Got a hot ting, but she coolie
I can buy Lauryn Hills for a few G
Cos I've made a lot of pounds since Tuesday
Man on a milli try'na lose weight
Have your whole family laying flowers
If a nigga wanna move bouquet
You little fuck boys, please behave
Think my niggas weak, yeah?
Till they leave you dazed
Don't seem amazed when they do stamp you out
Man will pass on the kicks like hand-me-downs
All these hoes wanna call the bosses
Got these hoes in a line like naughts and crosses
I run shit so niggas got a problem
I run shit and get blows, Boston!
Got hoes on my D you know how I do
Get sex by the minute who know how I move
Don't think man are nerds
I ain't no fucking chicken, but I got my dick in your bird
Hotties on deck, obvious!
Had one or two, threesomes with foreigners
Talking like your money's up there
But your an asshole in the rear

[Pre-Hook: Konan]
I hope The Lord forgives me
Eyes low blowing trees, I hope The Lord forgives me
White girl from overseas, I hope The Lord forgive me
She wants that Mike GLC, I hope The Lord forgives me

[Hook: Konan x4]
Hope the lord forgives me
Hope the lord forgives me (Oh Lord)

[Verse 2: Konan]
If she got style, I give her that one D
Red bottoms cost her a monkey
Neck on the line if I'm hungry
Might get two in your onesie
When you see my clique in masks
I bet you put that 106 in park
Jump out before it gets fatal
Then I take them bricks and go AWOL
Money over everything
Girls get a pounding
Drinking from the bottle
Woke up in my Calvins
Looking at me pouting
What you wanna do?
Ice cream cone, I know you wanna scoop
You know the deal, hotties wanna chill, I said
You know the deal, hotties wanna chill
First I go give Holly some wood
Then I get Beverly out them heels
When I woke up can't remember the rave
Lightie she's fucked off of MDMA
Come a long way, I remember the days
Getting queen heads off of Henrys and Eigths
Plenty of brain with these grands on my mind
Before Insta, we had the grams that they like
You can get 8 about hands on your 9
Watch your doughnuts get jammed with a knife
Tell the little sideman stand to the side
Talking bare till I panda your eye
(Wait)
About 'they bang all the time'
Had to sit down, can't stand all the lies (Behave!)
So fuck them in a mixtape
[?]
I don't know Paper Pabs, but my belt's got a big H buckle

[Pre-Hook: Konan]
I hope The Lord forgives me
Eyes low blowing trees, I hope The Lord forgives me
White girl from overseas, I hope The Lord forgive me
She wants that Mike GLC, I hope The Lord forgives me

[Hook: Konan x4]
Hope the lord forgives me
Hope the lord forgives me (Oh Lord)

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
My niggas started driving and I failed theory
Got shift, come out of jail early
When I picked my Dad up in a SLS he said an 'Our Father' and a 'Hail Mary' (Amen)
Think I give a fuck what a hater said?
Certified up in the A-Z
She made me cum and then she made my bed
And made me Kobe beef her in a Laker's [?](He's on Fire!)
Just another job for the Wonderman
[?] with no underpants
My parents call me Patrick, what they gonna do know that their son's a Dan?
Singing 'Started from the Bottom' with a bunch of man
But us man started on a hundred grand
A few just to move to [?] in
Show you how much I really love my fam
Man are try'na kick it on Soccer AM
Me, I'm on another programme
Send my Grandma back to Nigeria cause I didn't wanna have a Konan (Kaboom)
Take my wifey to another part of Italy cause I didn't want another romance (fuck!)
Stick out my middle finger taking matters into my own hands
It's Krept & Konan, Sylvester Stallone
Rambo times Django
I'm in the South of France with a Essex girl
In a Lambo that's been tangoed
I go in to the outro
I know Martin, I know Paltrow
And I know a nigga never used to rate me then
But I bet they love me now though, I'm gone

[Pre-Hook: Konan]
I hope The Lord forgives me
Eyes low blowing trees, I hope The Lord forgives me
White girl from overseas, I hope The Lord forgive me
She wants that Mike GLC, I hope The Lord forgives me

[Hook: Konan x4]
Hope the lord forgives me
Hope the lord forgives me (Oh Lord)
