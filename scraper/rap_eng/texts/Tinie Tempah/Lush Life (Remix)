[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah I’mma dance my heart out ’til the dawn
But I won’t be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
It was a crush
But I couldn’t, couldn’t get enough
It was a rush
But I gave it up
It was a crush
Now, I might have went and said too much
But that’s all it was
So I gave it up

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah I’mma dance my heart out ’til the dawn
But I won’t be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Get lit, all night, all summer
I paint pics so bright, so colored
On Instagram I don't like no other
So baby, why you don't write don't holla
Let's have a shot and get loose, get wavy
Cause we're sippin' on the juice that they've been
Catch shawarmas in Maroush, party with my troops, switch Ferrari to the coupe's
Maybe mention we can party on my roof
Cause it's a new year, all nighty
New spring, summer, new money
Skirt, new car key
Said she weren't clever in her class
First time she got a star
And now she wanna F somebody
And I just smashed a record with my seventh number one
I was praying for a time when I thought it would never come
Now I'm like no other
I'm sitting pretty high
With my stone cold stunner
(That's what I think, yeah)

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah I’mma dance my heart out ’til the dawn
But I won’t be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

[Post-Chorus: Zara Larsson]
Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late
Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

[Bridge: Zara Larsson]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah I’mma dance my heart out ’til the dawn
But I won’t be done when morning comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

[Post-Chorus: Zara Larsson]
Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late
Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late
