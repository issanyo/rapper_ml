Tinie!
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Jay Sean]
You don't know how I feel anymore
So much time has gone now here you are
And here I am, on this floor (floor, floor)
Since you walked away from me girl
You had me feeling lonely
Well if I can even talk to you girl
Would you act like you don't know me?
So I'm thinking what would happen if I
Was your man again if just for the night
I'd hold you close and you'd close your eyes
And we're dancing until the end of the night, the night
Oh I wish she knew that I

[Hook: Jay Sean]
I still love you, I still love you
I still love you, I still love you (baby)
I still love you, I still love you (I'm so jealous)
I still love you, I still love you

(Jay Sean: Dadadadadadadadada x3)
(Baby, oh oh oh)

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I still miss ya...
I wanna ask why you're breakin' my heart for?
When I see you gracing the dance floor
You’re amazin’ I can't flaw
So fly, no need for a passport
Speechless to the point that I can't talk
‘Cause the way that you’re using your curves is hot, hot, hot, hot
Wait there, lemme loosen my shirt
Uh, Lemme prove it could work
And when I see you move in a skirt
I realise how much I miss you baby
Lately, your absence is drivin’ me crazy
You can text me and tell me you hate me
But watchin’ you dance has made me realise

[Hook: Jay Sean]

[Verse 3: Jay Sean]
I can't lie I've been dying to meet, you for a while
Dying to speak
Wondering how’ve you been
Such a long time since you walked and you left the scene
3 years, are you counting too?
I've been around the world, no one can amount to you
Other girls may come and go, my heart won't move on
Guess they don't compare to you
Why you turning back on promises that you've made me?
Plans and memories won't fade too baby
This is the love I've ever known
Love me or hate me
I can't hold you down, I've been thinkin that lately

[Bridge: Tinie Tempah]
Right where our relationship left us
Girl come a little closer, let’s touch, let’s touch
Head rush, and I can't get you outta my head cause'

[Hook: Jay Sean]
