[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Lets go... (uh)
The ones we love
The ones we've lost
There's some we frame
And there's the ones we crop
When all my favorite ones were ruined by my ugly dog
But mum and daddy's wedding days are the most lovely shot
I had a 1000 free minutes till they cut me off
Talking to this chick that used to love me off
She used to send me lovely pictures of her lovely (uh)
Now they are even bigger and they're bustier
Ha wow. I used to wonder at the stars a lot
Sitting in my dads old barber shop
I used to pull faces when he passed the mop
Then he gave me his plate and his glass to wash
He made me wanna be the man in charge, the boss
That's how he got his first grey
But he laughed it off
The moments and memories we keep
Will be forever stored in my micro SD

[Hook: Mark Asari & Tinie Tempah]
Back in the day
When I was young
Those were the days
Wish that I could go back
I wanna take you back
To the very moment when you take a snap
Back in the day
To little me
Reminiscing all
All the memories that
Made me happy and they made me sad
All the very moments when you take a snap

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Second year of college on the fourth day
That's when I see you standing in the hallway
(uh) Leonardo da Vinci portrait
She had a face that I could be looking at all day
Dior shades, small waist
God put a lot of body in a tall frame
I got all fazed
She was pure
I took up literature just to get to know her more
She said she liked immature when she was immature
Shy girl, she could of worked on her image more
(uh) she made me laugh till my ribs were sore
We were for better for worse
We were for rich for poor
I was tidying my room
When my sister saw
And said T why you still got her pictures for?
These moments and memories we keep
Will be forever stored in my micro SD
Woo
