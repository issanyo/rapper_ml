You wanna see some ass
I wanna see some cash
Keep them dollars coming
And that's gon' make me dance
You wanna see some ass
I wanna see some cash
Keep them dollars coming
And that's gon' make me dance
And that's gon' make me dance
And that's gon' make me dance
Make it rain, tree
Make it, make it rain, trick
Make it rain, tree
Make it, make it rain, trick
Make it rain, tree
Make it, make it rain, trick
Make it rain, tree
Make it, make it rain, trick

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Turn up the volume
Pour out the pinot grigio
Nigga, all this jewellery
Push my weight up a couple kilos
I know the baddest bitch
All she drink is me so
All she do is squats
Her bum look like she from Puerto Rico
Expensive taste
What the hell does she know?
She's thinking Ace of Spades
I'm thinking Veuve Clicquot
Only 22
And I'm on my third vehicle
These niggas tryna stunt on me
Like what we earn is equal
Dollars legit
Nigga, my bank balance got commas and shit
I ain't got no BA honours
But bitch, I'm in first class next to Madonna and shit
Twitter me @TinieTempah
Quarter of a million, follow my shit
Better buss in on Erica
Like Jay Elec, tryna get his
You're a fuckwit
I'm champagne, you're Buck's Fizz
Now I'm in The Source, got y'all motherfuckers
Playing ketchup with no mustard
Keep telling girls old wife tales
Cause I ain't tryna be no husband
You ain't never felt no buzz like this
I'm grade A Columbian and I
Make it rain, trick
Make it, make it rain, trick
Make it rain, trick
Make it, make it rain, trick
Got more whips and chains
Than a motherfucking slave ship
She think she a princess
Cause she smell like [?], bitch
Looking, smelling, sounding
But not feeling like we made it

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Make it rain
So I gotta put my top up and I
Play the game
So I gotta risk my rock up in her
Favourite game
I'mma get her to lick this cock up and I
Say no names
If I get caught by them coppers
Meet in town with the hustlers
Going to pursue just to buss it up
Had 10 thounds , now 5 thounds gone
And the bitch getting wet like she dust it up
Talk about cars and you get embarrassed
Don't talk about malls till you get to Paris
Don't get a room without a terrorist
What the fuck you looking at, girl, all these carrots? Ching
Over freeze, I don't give a fuck if you over seas
Never find a nigga that's cold to me
Better yet, motherfucker with a colder sleeve
Truly, or just caught a cold
Motherfucker bout to blow a sneeze
He know how we go
We pulling outside with the coldest feet
