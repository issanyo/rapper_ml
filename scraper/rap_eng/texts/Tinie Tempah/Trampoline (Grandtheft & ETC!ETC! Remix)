[Intro]
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Jump, jump, jump, jump

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Eenie meanie minie, thank God it's Friday
Please don't ask me for my ID, if I'm in your iTunes library
Got my own book in my library, my mansion is so tidy
My neighbours hate my mistress cause she never wear no nighties
I go Claridges to do high tea, Jordans on like Spike Lee
I'm high end, you're High Street, swagger jacking my style
When I was a kid I used to save up for my Nikes
Now all these little kids is tryna save up for my Nikes, go

[Hook]
Shake, shake, shake, shake (Tambourine)
Jump, jump, jump, jump (Trampoline)
Shake what your mama gave you, shake it like a tambourine
Shake what your mama gave you, shake it like a trampoline
Shake...
Bass so loud you gon' have to scream

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
(Riff, Uh)
Yuh, I just bought a pilot from the Caymden Islands
More treasure on my chest than a Versace pirate
Your ma sent me a pic, gave me a computer virus (uh)
Diamonds twerking on my wrist, Miley Cyrus
You can break my heart, Billy Ray
I had the iPhone 7 in the fifth grade
These Neon Icon days are not for trade
I done poured an eight of grape in my Gatorade

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Yaaaaaa, 2 Chainz!
First of all I'm swagging, two girls with me so I'm bragging (yeah)
So much money in my pocket, my pants might be sagging (tell 'em)
My car might be tinted, my weed might be scented (scented)
My girl might be bow legged and her friend might be with her (damn)
Gold Roley on when I perform, ring-ring â€“ mobile phone
The way it's going off (off), it must be on (on)
'til the break of dawn, party like rock stars (true)
We don't stop 'til we see the fucking cop cars

[Hook]
