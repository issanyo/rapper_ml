I just can't stop the feelings, don't seem to go away
So if I hurt your feelings (yeah), don't blame it all on me (hahahaha)
I just can't stop the feeling (nothing else to say)
And now theyâ€™re here to stay
So if I hurt your feelings (don't take it the wrong way)
It's just because I'm
Oh la la la la, la la la la la
Oh la la la la, la la la, frisky
Oh la la la la, la la la la la
Oh la la la la, la la la, frisky

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
I think I found a winner, with no ring around her finger
Her dress from Allsaints, but I think I've found a sinner
I think her pals are with her, who's her girlfriend downing liquor?
If I tell her I'm a boxer, would she let me down her knickers?
I wanna pick her up, pin her down
She gon be waking up my neighbours if I bring her round
Where I'm from if you're famous you don't go to Tinsle Town
Pose for a picture, smile, the fashionista's out

[Pre-Hook: Tinie Tempah]
They say hey Mr, is it cool to take a picture
Girl you better keep your distance, I just wanna have (eh eh)
I'm on a mission I don't even wanna kiss her
Honey I won't even miss ya when I'm done with that (eh eh)

Oh la la la la, la la la, frisky

Would you risk it for a chocolate biscuit?
Would you risk it for a chocolate biscuit?

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
I'm suspicious, she looks delicious
She likes to talk a lot that's why I call her Trisha
Her nails are manicured, her hair has been conditioned
Don't worry bout her race, she ain't in no competition
She should be on television or on the radio singing
I would be the first to watch and I would be the first to listen
I would put her in positions like the mission from my staircase to
Her kitchen
Leave her twitchin, twitchin, twitchin, twitchin

I'm out of control, it's taking it's toll
We've still got a long way to go
I don't wanna take the piss
But I'm made for this, so let's take a risk
I'm out of control, it's taking it's toll
