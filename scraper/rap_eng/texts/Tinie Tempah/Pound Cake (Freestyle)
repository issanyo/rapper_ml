I love this game too much, I guess I'm obsessed
Little stimuli, visualise my concepts
Shit is complex, from RWD
Now I'm in Complex, left them by a long stretch
Man waste an entire life looking for Loch Ness
He's fucking jobless, the city's godless
This rat race, it's like we're in a contest
It's mad strange the way these rappers cross-dress, uh
My reputation's the only thing that I care about
Turned the rap into a career, now the Carrera's out
No camera phones, lavish home full of rag and bone
Only skeletons in my closet that I'm clearing out
Been round the world and we're the only names you hear about
I have to go on my Instagram to know my whereabouts
I bought the max of 30 racks and never wear em out
Ouch!
One too many shots, now they're thinking that I'm a target
Rarely stay in England, I'm thinking about the market
Releasing an album's great, the second time is the hardest
Whatever I have to do, I'll do it better regardless
Bredders get grey hairs gossiping in the barber's
One freestyle and they're thinking that they're hardest
Moment of silence for every rapper out of a deal
Incapable of finishing what they started
The same perception, everything is the way it seems
Wanted to be this big when I was fifteen
Mild nights doing shit I daydream
Being backstage, busting Joe with Jay-Z
They buy none of the dream and they try and sell you
Once you get your money right there ain't nothing no one can tell you
When you have a similar taste, eat from the same menu
Share similar stage, sell out the same venue
Shit classic, Pete and Planet Rock
They're bitter over the shit that they haven't got
I swag a lot, I brag a lot
Cause all I do is win, win, win, no matter what
Women wanna take me out, let's have a shot
Rappers wanna take me out, have a shot, uh
Your lyrics cheesy to me
I heard your F64 in my E63, woo
Done some planning, you're just planning to fail
How the hell you mad at me? You should be mad at yourself
Rappers get a bit of fame and then embarrass themselves
Hire a bunch of managers, can't even manage themselves
Man are only happy for you when the shit does well
Hating on a man soon as the shit don't sell
Dropping wisdom on the youngers so the kids don't fail
Tell these hoes I got a girl so every kiss don't tell
Ask all the teachers, I wasn't the A* child
Bet they're calling me a star now
Bet they're filling the class now
Tell all my teachers I'm still in the C class
Just the seat's more comfy and the window's all tinted
My shirt and tie became a little more vintage, uh
Real and fake became so easy to distinguish
Tweets from my foreign fans, no-speak-a-English, uh
Festivals with Ellie Goulding and Example
Now these rappers using Ellie Goulding on a sample
Rappers saw early, I could show you my examples, uh
It's my time, I could show you a whole armful
Heard that man are getting bitter again
Man have started going off on Twitter again
They tell themselves that they ain't jealous, they just sit and pretend
I know they're thirsty for the glamour and the glitter again
Tell the olders that I'm still the little kid in the ends
Just in the kind of places Kate and Pippa attend
I left the pizza boys that thought I won't deliver again
You say you're gonna be around, we'll see who is in the end
Fire
