[Intro: Vanya Taylor]
Be still

[Hook: Vanya Taylor]
What you see is not a time
The sky will light before you
You'll be lost and found again
This is only good for you
Don't try to understand, the colors in my hand
Just close your eyes and I will guide you

[Verse: Tinie Tempah]
I'm an extra terrestrial
Came up out the fucking dirt like a vegetable
Find out what my cerebellum for
When I pin the roof until my time I press record
Little Patrick didn't catch a little leprechaun
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh)
Where my paracetomol?
I done took some payment then I turned it in to pleasure
I beat rapper son of a batchelors now I'm the most eligible
Ha ha ha stupid motherfucker how you like that
How do I go back to this when I already tried that
This is from my inner child, said he wants his life back
I done turned myself in to a product with a price tag
All these fuckin people only round me cause I'm doing well
I'll be living life, Like I got no regard for human health
We have shed blood, sweat and tears and fought tooth and nail
Tryin' to accomplish something more than just a few have failed
And every other day, mommy call me just to ask me if I'm coping with the fame
But every other night I'm spilling vodka on some chicken heads
Doing shit I know would make her totally ashamed
I am overly engaged, some who know me think I changed
Due to certain sudden circumstances we are socially estranged
('stranged, 'stranged, 'stranged...)
Yeah
I'm in tip-top shape called me fitness instructor T
Superman genetics in my genes, dungarees
I can see these niggas through my gross and cutler piece
Slowly get the top of you, can't fuckin beat the luxury
Standing at a hundred feet, this is the Disc-Overy
Tinie is the name, disturbing London is the company
This is the Disc-Overy, everything infront of me
I ain't even worried about anything that's under me
Standing at a hundred feet, this is the Disc-Overy
Tinie is the name, disturbing London is the company
This is the Disc-Overy, the point of no recovery
I don't give a fuck, I'm going in cover me!

[Hook: Vanya Taylor]
What you see is not a time
The sky will light before you
You'll be lost and found again
This is only good for you
Don't try to understand, the colors in my hand
Just close your eyes and I will guide you

[Outro: Vanya Taylor]
Be still
