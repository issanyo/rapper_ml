[Intro: Tinie Tempah]
Yeahhh... this is for you's lot innit
Hold tight all the wifeys
Hold tight all the females who stuck by their man
Through thick and thin
You know we ain't always our best init
And I know you had to put up with a lot of shit init
Hold tight Flukes on productions
Yeah yeah, lemme tell you â€˜bout someone who's really special

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
You ring me often nightly
At precisely nine tight
Nigga never off
But you were one time like 10 o'clock
But that's life B
And you are my wifey
You look right with your hair to the side
Blue jeans, nice shoes and a yellow top
Likes tunes from bashment to mellowrock
You're a real chick
That's why I moved to you real quick
This some real shit
I'mma settle with a real chick
Anytime you call I'll be there quicker then Dorothy's heels click
Look cause you make me feel shit
I've never felt in my life
If ever I see my life
I'd wish forever you'd be my wife
Cause girl whatever you'd be I'll like
And I mean anything
I plan to give you many rings
Look and I don't mean phonecalls
I mean any bling
Anything you want I'll try to make it possible
Cause I got fame and fans
But without you it's like I lost it all
Your sexy Jamaican roots
Make you cook that hot
And not jus' only that coz
Your South American side brings out your backoff
And I would advise those other guys to back off
Cause you'll be pissed if I can't have a hold of the backoff
Or take them tits to a tax off
Your chick's like a Porsche she can wax off
Look she's rideable
But my chick's got wax neons and tints
She's brideable
I'm getting sick of making love tunes to make love to
So I'm gonna do this one more tune and send this out to the thugs too
It's for the wives

[Bridge: Tinie Tempah]
You know and I make her feel like
You know when I leave her she's like
You know when I call her she's like

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
You just excite me
Yeah, look when you say there's no breh like me
Check, I didn't believe in the 'one'
But this female just might be
Look, she's like me she likes a slice of mango in her ice cream
And dress all smart with the right jeans
So me and her are a tight team
I'm feelin' her and it might seem
Like I'm in love B
When she gets moved in a rave
She's like "See him? Yeah that's my hubby
And trust me we have many plans
So I don't care for any man"
Which breh can move to ma chick?
I don't think any can
This chick is like my night night
And you know how Kano spoke about her
I like her too much to leave, cause I feel like there's no hope without her
See this chick is my baby girl
And you might find us one day in Sainsbury's holding a baby girl who's
Calling me (d-d-d-d-d)
The sunshine is among us
Let's leave others in the rain
I like it when you come and close the color of your name
But I'm sick of makin' love tunes to make love to
So I'm gonna do this one more tune and send this out to the thugs too
It's for the wives
