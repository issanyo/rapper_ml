[Intro: Roll Safe]
Ayo lithen, ahaha it's crazy

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yo, first it was my Sony, then it was my Xbox
I made it to the A-list, then I cut my ex off
Number one rapper, swear down, I've got the best job
I bet you all these number ones are pissing all the rest off
I'm on another level, yeah, different type of stress, darg
Running through the game, getting money like a hedgehog
Rappers that I checked tryna play down my success
Cause they're on the underground, tryna get off at the next stop
Waiting for the contract, David to Goliath
I don't play no Mortal Kombat, nah, I ain't on that
Speed off in a ghost, no trace, no contact
Something that these niggas never seen like a wombat
Niggas say I didn't do it right, but they're wrong, blud
Name an English rapper, hundred million on their song, blud
Nah, I didn't think so, there's something in your drink, bro
We're on an elevator screaming bun another hater cuh

[Verse 2: MoStack]
"Mo wouldn't have girls if it weren't for the fame"
Well, duh, how'd you think I fucked your babe?
Don't you hate it when the condom burst when you're pressing it?
But love it when the clinic says negative
Whoa, was that way too much?
She's like "Mo, you know I love you", I was like "wait, who, what?"
And then she said "nah, I'm only joking"
I was like "move gyal, you play too much"
Nah, we don't do that, you're better off tryna find who killed 2Pac
Why would you do that?
Yes, Cupid missed me
Shoot at the top and you might just hit me, bitch, don't kiss me
I just met a real white girl and she crazy
Whine in the house like her first name's Amy
I don't mean to brag but call another time, please
Why? I'm just in the studio here with Tinie

[Hook: Aleisha Lee]

[Verse 3: Sneakbo]
I ain't playing games, I don't bust jokes
Don't ever say my name or you're fucked, bro
And if you owe me money, pay it pronto
Like Pinocchio, I'm rolling with my long nose
Oh, I ain't playing, what you saying?
Young black boy feeling like I fucking made it
Started on the block, did you think that I could make it?
Now my daddy drop, gully bop, stunting on my pagans
Like yeah, I'm everywhere
I'm with the gang and we're going anywhere
See, when I pull up in the whip, fam, I pull up on your chick
I could tell that she wants this dick
So I hit her with the slap-pa-pa-pap a dat-da-dat-dat
2-step in the pussy, the pussy was too mad
I tell her that I'll be right back
Get the weed and the junk food, I'll be in the lab
