[Intro]
Tinie Tempah, Kelly Rowland lets go
Invincible, invincible
Invincible, invincible
We're invincible

[Verse 1]
Uh yeah they said we shouldn't
Yeah they said we wouldn't
Uh look where we are
We've done what they thought we couldn't
As bad as the odds were looking
Push yeah we kept on pushing
And every time I nearly hit the ground
You were my cushion
There's evidence that proves
That you were heaven sent
'Cos when I needed rescuin'
You were there at my defense
Girl in you I find a friend
You make me feel alive again
And I feel like the brightest star
Cause you make me shine again

[Hook: Kelly Rowland]
No matter where we are
No matter just how far are paths may lead
We don't need no shields
Love is the armor that we need
We're invincible (we are), Invincible (you are)
Invincible, Love's our protector
Invincible (we are), Invincible (you are)
Invincible, We're invincible

[Verse 2]
Uh from the wildest water
Uh to the highest mountains
Uh you and I forever
Even through the driest deserts
You lift me higher than ever
I feel as light as a feather
And when we're fightin' together
We can take on the weather
I will keep you warm through
Every single storm you
Ever have to walk through
I will go before you
I will be the voice when you
Need someone to talk to
Please don't ever doubt me
Let me reassure you

[Hook]

It's you and me against the world
They can't stop us now
We've come too far
We've worked too hard
We're invincible
Forever

[Hook]
