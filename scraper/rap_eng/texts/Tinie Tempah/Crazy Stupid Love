[Intro: Cheryl]
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love

[Verse 1: Cheryl]
Swore I would never be that girl holding your hand
Look at you gazing, acting like your biggest fan
I used to make fun of all the things that they said
Saying I will never be like that
But then you showed up like you had been there before
Was like you knew me, had me with every word
You saw right through me, melted me down to the core
I was done when you walked through that door

[Chorus: Cheryl]
Well, I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop, sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster but I'm only going up
I'm in crazy stupid love

[Verse 2: Cheryl]
So call me baby, in front of all of your friends
It used to shake me, but would you say it again?
It's a weird feeling, we're laying here in the dark
And I don't wanna fight this spark
You got me flying, don't wanna ever come down
I'm realising I kinda need you around
Hard to believe it, I'm that girl holding your hand
And I'm still trying to understand

[Chorus: Cheryl]
Well, I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop, sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster but I'm only going up
I'm in crazy stupid love

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Whistle, I like it when you blow the whistle
You make me wanna ch-bang bang bang bang bang, baby
I don't own a pistol
My tongue wagging when you wiggle
I'll end up kissing you with or without the mistle
Love the open toes and the clothes even though we ain't official
You official, you official
When you see me in a suit, say I'm so smooth criminal
Playing hard to get - girl, you're being too difficult
Let me in your mind 'fore I get to the physical
I ain't tryna mess with any woman - that's typical, need original
Lips and eyes
Big surprise if she have hips and thighs
Kissed her twice, now she say I'm Mr Right
She had my D, now she dickmatised, whoa lord

[Chorus: Cheryl]
Well, I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop, sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster but I'm only going up
I'm in crazy stupid love
