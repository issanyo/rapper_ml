[Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
100k, 100k
I might go to the bank and just take out 100k
Hit the club and roll around up in 100k
How many views you think I’ll get that day? 100k
100k, 100k
Praise the lord I thought I’d never ever see the day
Everywhere I go my niggas know it's me that's paying
So much money coming in, I think I need a safe

[Verse 1: G Frsh]
I was like 21 sitting at my mums house when I counted out my first hundred
Slanging to the fiends, now I mastered the cream
All these bitches want to queue for my cumber
More money, more problems so imagine all the stress I'm under
With these sparklers we make lightning
Cause' I can't let them steal my thunder
Because there's ten yellow bottles sitting on a wall
So we bought them all
Five for the mandem, two for the bitches
And then three for the floor
With no security I feel safe
Fresh Prince, I fill banks
And I’m still tryna to Bill Gates
And I ain't talking making doors fam
Urgh

[Chorus]
100k, 100k
I might go to the bank and just take out 100k
Hit the club and roll around up in 100k
How many views you think I’ll get that day? 100k
100k, 100k
Praise the lord I thought I’d never ever see the day
Everywhere I go my niggas know it's me that's paying
So much money coming in, I think I need a safe

[Verse 2: Tinchy Stryder]
Strides!!
100k and that's on a couple chains
Open shirt from Vivienne Westwood might see me on a yacht with Jay
White car with a black top, Beemer
R8 might cop me a two seater
Mazel Tov, cash in hand Bar Mitzvah
You ain't never seen 100k
Label paying a whole heap even before they’ve listened
And then we toast champagne on the Roleys
Because they’re water resistant
Catch flights, private j-e-t
Blue marli with R.S.M.D
100K, old moneys great
It’s only right that the trips on me
Ah huh

[Chorus]
100k, 100k
I might go to the bank and just take out 100k
Hit the club and roll around up in 100k
How many views you think I’ll get that day? 100k
100k, 100k
Praise the lord I thought I’d never ever see the day
Everywhere I go my niggas know it's me that's paying
So much money coming in, I think I need a safe

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Press a button in mi car it speaks for itself
If you don’t think that money talk then speak for yourself
Top floor up in the Maurice, the suite’s something else
I got so much presence bitch I think I need some help
Yea motherfucker MVP of the year motherfucker
Suddenly a nigga got shares motherfucker
All I see is yachts and lears motherfucker
Billionaires motherfucker
Sipping champagne like I sip beer
Niggas thought they ran tings tort’s and hair
Nigga oh yeah
When money talks I listen
That's why the UK rap scene got another millionaire

[Chorus]
100k, 100k
I might go to the bank and just take out 100k
Hit the club and roll around up in 100k
How many views you think I’ll get that day? 100k
100k, 100k
Praise the lord I thought I’d never ever see the day
Everywhere I go my niggas know it's me that's paying
So much money coming in, I think I need a safe

[Verse 4: Konan]
A 100k, a 100k
99 problems, a 100k
Views in a day on the YouTube vid
YouTube money in your head, YouTube hits
For the love of the dough niggas stuck on the road
With some dubs from the ol’, trying move food quick
Put some Uggs in a hole I ain't loving the dough
Want a 100k and a big new crib
With 100 bags, who need a suitcase?
Time is money and you neeks are too late
Married to the money all I needs a bouquet
Get money all week we don’t need to chose days
Selfish I don’t need to move bait
Got the game covered you can keep your duvet
Birthday cake hip hip hooray
30 bags in my room no room for room mates
I’m calm

[Verse 5: Krept]
I looked at Konan, like I ain't got 100k yet
He said look at your income you probably will in about 100 days Krept
He can see the future That's So Raven
I got money in-dian, like I’m Asian
Don’t sing to police how I get cake in
Because I’ll rap a singer Drake him
I-I-Im not slow g but I love p and get dough
So I’m dopey
Bags in my hand motherfucker no groceries
I’m not grumpy but I get moaney
A lot of girls for the money and the fame ting
I had two chicks Holly and Caitlin
They said they wanna try angles
It went from a threesome to a Freemason
