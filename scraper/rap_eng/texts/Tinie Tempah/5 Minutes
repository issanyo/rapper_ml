[Intro: J. Warner]
Fasten your seatbelt
If you're on board
Fasten your seatbelt
If you're on board
Fasten your seatbelt
If you're on board
Fasten your seatbelt
If you're on board
All we got is five minutes 'til we all go
All we got is five minutes 'til we all go
All we got is five minutes 'til we all go

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Hello world, yeah, let's go! (boom to you fellas)
Wake up in the morning and I smell my breath
I send a picture to my niggas of the girl in bed
I can diggety-bop with diggetty-Puff, Pharrell and them
On the chimney tops of the prison world's address
I said thanks, but I haven't heard you're welcome yet
So fuck everybody yo, we got the world ahead
I get black chicks, white things, purples, reds
And my head's screwed on, call it permanent
Excuse my Portugese, that's German, French
But I fuck with BBC like Fearne and Reg
Bought a pair of Jordan 3s with a firm cement
Slagging on a hundred damn trillion percent
Even in my skinny jeans I still walk like this
And 007 make me talk like this
Pedal to the medal, tell Jeremy Clarkson
That anybody my age should drive a Porsche like this!

[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
I've been ready from the get-go
You better keep your mouth open if your legs closed
5 minutes till' I explode
5 minutes till' I explode
5 minutes till' I explode (tick, tick, tick, tick, boom to you fellas)
5 minutes till' I explode
5 minutes till' I explode
5 minutes till' I explode
5 minutes till' I explode (tick, tick, tick, tick, boom to you fellas)

Bloody crazy roast on Sunday
Got mash-up on Monday
Real twisted on Tuesday
Woke up wasted on Wednesday
Got completely trashed on Thursday
Fucked up on Friday
Bad money from Saturday
(Tick, tick, tick)

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
I threw my baby out the pram, and her toys as well
I got adults acting like a bunch of boys and girls
She asked me why I never let a woman try on my shades
Don't want her fucking hair on my tortoise shells
For my festivals, I can sense some awesome wealth
I get the citizens cane like Orson Welles
My number even had to change cause some annoying girl
It's like fucking Babestation on my voicemail
No matter how much you flush the toilet, ill
We're the motherfucking shit, you can't avoid the smell
All these swagger-jackers getting me annoyed as hell
You ain't never seen talent on The Voice as well!
London Fashion Week made me walk like this
And Stephen Fry made me want to talk like this
Finger on the button, tell whoever's in charge
Che Guevara made me want to break the law like this!

[Bridge: J. Warner]
Fasten your seatbelt
If you're on board
Fasten your seatbelt
If you're on board
All we got is five minutes 'til we all go
All we got is five minutes 'til we all go
All we got is five minutes 'til we all go

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Tick, tick, tick, boom!
Wake up in the morning and I smell my breath
I could have had to be going to work instead
Fuck a silly contract, I return the cheque
When you was trying to make money, did you earn respect?
I seen your pussy game made me walk like this
And Star Wars made me use the force like this
When you're fucking busy having dinner with stars
You better start eating with your knife and fork like this!

[Hook]
