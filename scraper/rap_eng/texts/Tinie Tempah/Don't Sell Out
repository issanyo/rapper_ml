[Intro: Tinie Tempah]
They sayin’ don’t sell out
Don’t sell out, uh uh, let’s go!

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
I’m bad, you know it
Disturbing London Poet
Sparklers in my Moet
If you need the glass then I'll pour it
Fashion week, front row it
Chelsea and Soho it
When I valet park my *skrrt*
Then the council come and tow it
Red bull, Vodka, JD and coke
Bitch turn up your radio
Heartless verses, Pay As You Go
Mixed with a little bit of KC' & Jo
Now my sex is crazy yo'
Three to one ratio
Tryin' to get fellatio
From girls as fresh as Daisy Lowe
Them girls say hi, them girls say hello
I tell them stick your number in an envelope
She take it off but leave on her stilettos
You know you can find me 'round white girls like Othello
We say to them

[Hook: Candice Pillay (x2)]
Oh you’re mad you ain’t us
Pull up and I’m famous
Party like I'm from Vegas
Yeah that alcohol made us
Now turn up and don’t sell out
Now turn up and don’t sell out
Now turn up and don’t sell out
Now turn up and don’t sell out

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah!
Tiger Beer or Cobra
Lime in my Corona
Chased out my bilateral periorbital hematoma
Livin' la vida loca, Ibiza, Barcelona
Life threw me lemons, now Celebrity Juice on my sofa
Got a girl in Oklahoma, and a LA girl that do yoga
A girl in Amsterdam that's a stoner
And a sexy female chauffeur
And a girl that makes a racket
I call her Anna Kournikova
Rap put me in another tax bracket
So much for my diploma
They say "what’s up?" They say "what's happening?"
We’ll be in the club just racks on racks on racks in
Was using words but now we're using actions
Been around the world, and ladies love me and my London accent
We be saying to them

[Hook: Candice Pillay (x2)]

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Am I drunk? No; am I lean? Yes
I do her raw, no; am I clean? Yes
I do a tour, fo' sho'
Bring out to mean, guest
Roses Gabor, no
Ester Dean, yes
Am I mature? No
Should I be? Yes
And my jeans still saggy like the Queen
And I wear a lot of gold around my V
And I sell out all my shows just like they’re free
We keep on saying to them

[Hook: Candice Pillay]
