[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, she said that I'm the only one
Her body banging like a loaded gun
She told me she from Beverly Hills
I told her I'm Axel Foley's son
Yeah, I'm partying with 3OH!3
But my hotel room's 301
So I'mma hit the club and use both my balls
That's what I call a hole in one
Yeah, I'mma leave you starstruck
Charged up, I'm buying till the bar shut
My guard's up, girl, I could drop a hard nut
When I get up in that bush like a gardener
No strings, I fucked my guitar up
So don't ring, you won't even get an answer
My name's T, and I be making star bucks
Ha, hakuna matata!

[Hook: 3OH!3](x2)
She wants to touch me, woo ooh, she wants to love me, woo ooh
She'll never leave me woo ooh, woo ooh, ooh ooh
Don't trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won't trust a ho cause the ho won't trust me

[Verse 2: 3OH!3]
X's on the back of your hands
Washed them in the bathroom to drink like the bands
And the set list, you stole off the stage
Has red and purple lipstick all over the page
Br-br-br-bruises cover your arms
Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm
And the best is, no one knows who you are
Just another girl alone at the bar

[Hook](x2)

[Bridge: 3OH!3]
Shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, fermez la bouche
Why you tryna be Ellen DeGeneres? Shush
We the motherfuckers Disturbing London
Baby, I can make you the next Kelly Brook
Or Meagan Good
I've got that 007 look
I'mma make sure that you never forget me
And I never ever ever forget the hook

[Hook](x2)
