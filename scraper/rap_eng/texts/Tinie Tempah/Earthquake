[Intro: Labrinth]
Labrinth come in...
Labrinth come in...
Labrinth come in...
Labrinth come in...

[Verse 1: Labrinth]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is something
They call a ground-breaker
So, let me first apologize to the shirts and the ties
For your make-up
Cause I'll make you ugly, as soon as it drops
We're on a rampage, bottles poppin' off
Before you know it, there's rubble and dust
Cause we'll be fuckin' it up
Somebody say 'You better run!'

[Hook: Labrinth]
Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, "Yeah!"
I predict an earthquake up in here
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
Hey, yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here

[Verse 2: Labrinth]
Ladies and gentleman
What you're about to witness is no illusion
And now, we got the bass banging
From here to Buckingham Palace
They're all moving
Hey Simon, we're fucking them up, turnin' them SyCo
Everybody rock, let's bring the house down
To rubble and dust cause we'll be fuckin' it up
Somebody say 'You better run!'

[Hook: Labrinth]
Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, "Yeah!"
I predict an earthquake up in here
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
Hey, yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here

[Break: Labrinth]
I predict an earthquake up in here
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yes mosh for me
Hey, yes
We can make an earthquake up in here (so here we go, we go)

[Interlude: Tinie Tempah]
Hey, yo, Labrinth
This one's feeling like a straight 10 on the richter scale, ya know?

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, fire, fire
We about to set this place on fire
Without a match or lighter
Don't do girlfriends,Â one nighters
Make them (Ahh), C-minor
If I want Christian or Kurt Geiger
I just phone up their designer
Doing all nighters, no days off
Gray hairs and a little bit of weight loss
I predict (riots!)
I predict (chaos!)
I predict (people!)
I predict (oh!)
Disturbing London, got the whole city panicking
I be Nostradamus, this my ni-ni-nigga Labrinth

[Hook: Labrinth]
Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, "Yeah!"
I predict an earthquake up in here
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
Hey, yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here
