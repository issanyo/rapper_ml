[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
Why'd you have to give up? (Why? Why? Why?)
Why'd you have to give up now, when we were so close?
When we were so close
I swear this could've been us (Why? Why? Why?)
Imagine where we'd be right now
'Cause we were so close
Yeah, we were so close

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Wow, few years ago, we were on the radio that weren't legal
Now you're scary yo, yo take control of your ego
This real so your fake to the mandem now
When I came with my sound, I made the mandem proud
You used to be comfortable just tryna be the best in your area
I was never satisfied, I'm tryna be the best from this era
You said you've been depressed, you was re-addressing your career
So I took a UberX when I could've came in my Carrera
Just to make you feel better
Just to make you feel worth something I showed you that I cared
I admit that I went ghost and didn't phone you for two years
Ain't easy breaking through glass ceilings, we fighting wars out here
We fighting wars out here, yeah I out ran that hare
So it's okay throw shade like those tortoise shells I wear
Yeah, 'cause if I lose the fame, don't know whose to blame
I'd probably do the same
Last level of a computer game, you can't clock
But don't lose faith, it ain't too late

[Bridge: Guy Sebastian]
This fight ain't even over, the bell didn't even ring
There's no blood on the towel, so why'd you throw it in
You could've tried believing but you're leavin'
You could've tried believing but you're leavin'

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Ah, living insomnia, billin' up ganja
Tryna get bigger on Myspace, bigger on Tumblr
Saw a little bit of myself in you, you was just a bit younger
Switching your line and ringing my phone on private number
Told me you was ready for the world, yeah I can see you had a hunger
Said I'm gonna make them respect me, like Dizzee and DJ Wonder
Remember how your wifey went on stage, got a bit drunker
Didn't wanna share no limelight, now you wanna steal my thunder
Tripled my net worth, 'cause I'm rich in karma
Even let you come to my studio, get you bits mixed and mastered
Always showed love as an artist
Celebrate it when you charted
Then you started going on darky, wonder why the hype never lasted
You can tell lies for a whole lifetime but the truth is a bastard
We was with you on the phone till late, those times when you was at your darkest
Now apart from your African friend's house, you ain't seeing no red carpets
Had a whole world in your finger tips and now your so way past it

[Bridge: Guy Sebastian]
This fight ain't even over, the bell didn't even ring
There's no blood on the towel, so why'd you throw it in
You could've tried believing but you're leavin'
You could've tried believing but you're leavin'

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
Why'd you have to give up? (Why? Why? Why?)
Why'd you have to give up now, when we were so close?
When we were so close
I swear this could've been us (Why? Why? Why?)
Imagine where we'd be right now
'Cause we were so close
Yeah, we were so close

[Verse 3: Bugzy Malone]
(Yeah, Bugzy Malone)
I was sitting in the back of the car the tears rolling down my face
I didn't wanna cry but I know the streets aren't safe
And I know the police don't play, they've gotta be on my case
There's only so many crimes that can take place before they observate
I was on a reministic ting but I didn't wanna miss this time
I was studying, so I watched Giggs's, then I watched K Koke's, then I watched Nines
But when I say this, couldn't agree with this shit
I'm one of the realest out here, man make music, man don't bitch
So I jumped out the car, in a different town
Wiped off the tears, no turning around
Told myself, watch man do my ting
They're gonna be like London's burning down
Gonna be like London's burning down
I've been grinding five years, four mixtapes, 1 EP;
Never got a retweet, watch how it changes now
