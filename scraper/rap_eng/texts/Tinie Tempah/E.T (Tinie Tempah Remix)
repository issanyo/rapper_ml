[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say, be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

[Pre-Hook: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

[Hook: Katy Perry]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Bridge: Katy Perry]
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all
All

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Katy, you gon' create a monster, fucking with an alien
Cause once you let me in, your world will never be the same again
We invading USA, the Russians and Australians
Cause we keep the radio active, uranium
Landed in a pod in Little Britain, David Walliams
Now I'm in your Sun, your Star, your Mirror and your Mail again
I'm Saville Row ten remixed with vintage Nike blazers
I can read your body language like you just came out of LA Ink
Caps lock, baby, cause I'm all about my capital
I think so irrational, I'm big international
All my raps is factual, I'm so supernatural
And I've been fly a very long time, terminators

[Hook]
