[Chorus: Tiggs Da Author]
Your love is my rehab
Still turn up on a Wednesday
Hell yeah, I get my friends' advice
But I don't hear what my friends say

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, young man lookin' for the Jumpman
Tryna say good and livin' in Plumstead
Feelin' like young J, tryna make Blueprint
Used to have Reason, on my old laptop
When I was still producing
Used to get at Kings Cross, get off at Euston
Tryna make a little movement
T, Jazz, Henry okay
Niggas in my whip lookin' so bait
Rap carpool karaoke
Missed calls like, "Honey are you okay?"
You had just turned 21
I was 19, naive, very young
Gettin' high, eatin' Chinese, gettin' drunk
You lead on but you never used to let me come, but let me come

[Chorus: Tiggs Da Author]
Love is my rehab
Still turn up on a Wednesday
Hell yeah, I get my friends' advice
But I don't hear what my friends say

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, yeah, virgin, uh
Virgin, I was still a virgin
Tryna do theory, then we dropped Rehab
I was still learnin'
Runnin' from the bailiffs, tryna get playlist
Say I'm too urban then I made a banger
Then I lost Grandma, couldn't make it to the service
Kells didn't think it was right
I didn't think at the time
Just gettin' into this life
Heard he was prayin' and prayin'
And prayin' and prayin' 'til I was big time
Then prayers started turnin' to fruition
It's was either this, get a job or go prison
Suck a little bit when nobody saw the vision
You know what it is, your the only one who listened, yeah

[Chorus: Tiggs Da Author]
Love is my rehab
Still turn up on a Wednesday
Hell yeah, I get my friends' advice
But I don't hear what my friends say

[Bridge: Tiggs Da Author]
Daddy, daddy doing work
Mama, mama doing church
Couple bredrins doing birds
Couple exes doing worse
I don't need your jealousy, yeah
I don't need your therapy, yeah

[Chorus: Tiggs Da Author]
'Cause love is my rehab
Still turn up on a Wednesday (I still turn up, yeah)
Hell yeah, yeah I hear my friends' advice
But I don't hear what my friends say (No way, no way)
