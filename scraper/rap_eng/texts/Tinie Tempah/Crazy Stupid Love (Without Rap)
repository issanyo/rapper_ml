[Intro]
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love

[Verse 1]
Swore I would never be that girl holding your hand
Look at you gazing, acting like your biggest fan
I used to make fun of all the things that they said
Saying I will never be like that
But then you showed up like you had been there before
Was like you knew me, had me with every word
You saw right through me, melted me down to the core
I was done when you walked through that door

[Chorus]
Well, I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop, sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster but I'm only going up
I'm in crazy stupid love

[Verse 2]
So call me baby, in front of all of your friends
It used to shake me, but would you say it again?
It's a weird feeling, we're laying here in the dark
And I don't wanna fight this spark
You got me flying, don't wanna ever come down
I'm realising I kinda need you around
Hard to believe it, I'm that girl holding your hand
And I'm still trying to understand

[Chorus]
Well, I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop, sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster but I'm only going up
I'm in crazy stupid love

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Well, I don't know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop, sink my heart to my feet
It's like a rollercoaster but I'm only going up
I'm in crazy stupid love

[Outro]
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
I'm in crazy stupid love
Oh, I'm in crazy stupid love
La la la la la la la love
La la la la la la la love
