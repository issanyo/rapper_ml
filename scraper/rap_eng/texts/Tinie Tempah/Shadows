[Chorus: Bipolar Sunshine]
You are more than able, of cutting through the cable
But I see your angel, don't act young and wasteful
Come to the garden and let your guard down
Come to your senses it will all be clear

[Verse: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, yeah (ah)
I tell these stunners I'm stone cold and Austin Powers
Too busy working, all my niggas talking about power
I made a vow that I won't end up like Kenny Powers
When the money goes and friendships turn sour
Still rapping with soul cause I never sold mine
For the whole time did it without a co-sign
They can't approach their shit the way I approach mine
Dumi knew that he stumbled on a goldmine
They think you bust and it's all roses and daffodils
I could have moved off ends, but I'm in Hackney still
I could have S-curled my hair, my hair is nappy still
I showed you the most how to make the most out of crappy deal
Opened doors everybody getting signed now
I'm having dinner with greatest of all times now
I never do it off of the top, still gotta write it down
Ask the hackers, all the bars is on my iCloud
Still fresher than Brooke Beckham and Ash Ketchum
Took my 'ghini back to Plumstead and back to Peckham
Today's beef then tomorrow your friends
Rappers follow you, unfollow you, then follow you again
Don't let no writers in my ghost sound borrow no pen
I tell him a man his face I got a problem with him, straight
Uh, I can take your girl in woven sandals
And turn her to Naomi Campbell
Horror stories, I'm so weary of divorce
I might move to North Korea because my career is headed north
You ain't see us in the wagon then I swear it was the Porsche
Take my niggas to LA where this ain't against the law
I ain't scared of no lawsuit, word to my tailor
I didn't even ask Calvin when he took us out to Vegas
They wanna see us down, they don't want see us up
And when Harry cuts his hair, whole world going nuts

[Chorus: Bipolar Sunshine]
You are more than able, of cutting through that cable
But I see your angel, don't act young and wasteful
Come to the garden and let your guard down
Come to your senses it will all be clear
I just wanna be the light you wanna see
The star in your eyes, the glimmer in the shadow
I just wanna be the light you wanna see
The star in your eyes, the glimmer in the shadow

[Outro: Bipolar Sunshine]
Let me roll with you and I can find
Let me roll with you, all the pieces in your grand design
