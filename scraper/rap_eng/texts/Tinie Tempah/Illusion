[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
My neighbours keep gettin' mugged so we sleep with the alarm on
Bedroom filled with Nike SBs and Comme Des Gar√ßons
Staring at the ceiling listening to So Far Gone
Tryna make the world pay me pay me daily like carson
My mom say I need to put on weight like Kelly Clarkson
She say I work like a soldier steady marchin'
Left right, left right, left right, left right
Tryna keep it smelling like Elizabeth Arden, ahh
Apartments, yard river garden
Money in the jeans, car key in the cardigan
When I was a kid I wished that I could be in Narnia
Every time my father disregarded an argument, ahh
Wishin' I was sitting on the moon, watching videos
Wishin' I was living on a shoe, with dishonest youths
Doing things I didn't wanna do
Wishin I could see the world through a different point of view

[Hook: Tinie Tempah (Sam Frank)]
Leave your baggage at the stairs and your worries at the door
You don't have to think about problems anymore
(I can make you, believe in anything)
Uh, I know that everything's changed
But I'm under this illusion just so I don't go insane
(I can make you, believe in anything)

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, you ever been too fed up to get up
Or wish you had a huge shredder for a few letters
Dreaming up these stories of these whole new adventures
Like blue Louis Vuittons on the new Cinderella
Check your sense of humour on the new rumours getting better
But I'mma teach you a lesson
And I don't mean a lecture
Cause only fake [rich, rich] dudes get jealous
And we'll never let a [rich, rich] dude get near us
Cause we're up with the stars, somewhere in outer space
Cause on the underground I felt so out of place
I got Tom, Dick and Harry all lookin' at my face
I know they wanna say safe but don't know how to say it
Bad body language, I don't understand it
When they see Patrick then they all turn to gangsters
Hehe, And that's a passage from my mantra
I started reading from a whole different chapter

[Hook]

[Outro: Sam Frank]
I can make you
I can make you
I can make you
Believe in anything
