[Verse 1: Cadet]
Well baby I've been moving like I needed to
Uh, I've been putting crazy, I was in the music baby
Every time you speak it's like I'm beefing you
Uh, you said I only really care about the music baby
Honestly I feel like I agree with you
Uh, You see it's just the way we do things
(Yeah) Me and my homie, we be moving like district
So baby girl no we ain't letting you in
You getting that? Well baby if you didn't know me I do it slowly
And by the way my name is Cadet if you ain't know me
When I was 14 I was trynna to be an OG out in Egypt thinking maybe I should buy a dodgy Roley
Oh shit man, I'm on a roll now
And I be chasing my dream, why would I slow down?
See I've been moving like I'm moving can't help you with what you're doing
You're a big man do it on your own now, blaze

[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
If we got shades on when we in the club then you know we getting lit
Four or five Cartier bracelets all on my chick
Still got to tick a few pop stars off of my list
You don't wanna fuck with a nigga like me cause a nigga might flip

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yo, yo yo yo
[?] lyrics on the same page
We ain't on the same brainwaves
I've been popping since late days
I've been popping since safeway nigga, uh
Take two puffs, tell 'em no biggie
Fam I came up out the dirt, s'why the hell I'm so skimpy
Every time you spit a verse
Chicky-Chicky-Chicky-Chicky-Chicky, dunno what the fuck you're saying
Like Iggy, woo
Everything fancy, uh, I said everything fancy
Uh, It don't matter if I'm doing it with Zayn Lowe
[?] nigga hey
Niggas still wanna @ me
It's not real it's just rap beef
Get the fuck up off my Twitter you could spend it in the gallery or get it from my allergy

[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
If we got shades on when we in the club then you know we getting lit
Four or five Cartier bracelets all on my chick
Still got to tick a few pop stars off of my list
You don't wanna fuck with a nigga like me cause a nigga might flip

[Verse 3: Youngs Teflon]
I dressed like I graduated
But I'm from the mud, I can't fabricate it
Your favorite rapper was animated
These chicks love my aura, they gravitating
Old ones still bug me too
Say they love me I say I love me too
I take some Morley's, some VQ
Me vs. you is like 1 vs. 2
I would probably be bigger if I begged it
Wasn't on the remix cause I shegged it
Yeah they mad me doing loads online
Then they see me in the flesh and they legged it
Said she wanna chill and do Netflix
But every time she come around we do neck shit
Only let her turn round when her necks stiff
And I'm trying to kick her out before my next spliff

[Hook x2: Tinie Tempah]
If we got shades on when we in the club then you know we getting lit
Four or five Cartier bracelets all on my chick
Still got to tick a few pop stars off of my list
You don't wanna fuck with a nigga like me cause a nigga might flip
