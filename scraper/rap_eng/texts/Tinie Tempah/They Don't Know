[Chorus: Alastair]
Uh, when the cameras show up, we show out
And we can roll up and roll out
Let them think what they think, it's funny how
They didn't get it then, so they won't now
Yeah 'cause they don't know us
They can't say what they say
Don't give a thought
Don't need them anyway

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Everywhere I go, I gotta pose
Sittin' on the throne with a 'fro
Chillin' with a prince at the BAFTA's
Gold all over the globe
Anytime I stress, I can get it from a rasta
Headside, kill 'em when they know
Didn't wanna, now they wanna know
Baby said, "Shh, you can hit it on the low"
You can hit it on the low, you can hit it on the low
Come in on your own, leave your knickers at the door
Yeah, I'm the AP, got the wonder tug-a-war
I don't holla anymore, tryna make a nigga poor
Tryna hit me with the drink, no no
They might think, they don't know
Let 'em talk ish, promo
'Cause we don't really care 'bout nothin'

[Chorus: Alastair]
When the cameras show up, we show out
And we can roll up and roll out
Let them think what they think, it's funny how
They didn't get it then, so they won't now
Yeah 'cause they don't know us
They can't say what they say
Don't give a thought
Don't need them anyway

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
It's Kid Ink, uh, canine
That kitty got me feelin' like a canine
I'm just tryna live, baby, can I?
We at the KWest, startin' KI's
Woo, I just bought the whole LA out
Uh, live is a beach, bitch lay out
Uh, hit the blunt, baby what you gotta say now?
Woo, I know you want it, ow
Ha, get you higher than the Eiffel
Pour up, baby, put a lil' ice too
Yeah, I remember back in high school
I used to have a girl that looked just like you
Yeah and with all of these flashbacks
Say ain't no tellin' what I might do

[Chorus: Alastair]
When the cameras show up, we show out
And we can roll up and roll out
Let them think what they think, it's funny how
They didn't get it then, so they won't now
Yeah 'cause they don't know us
They can't say what they say
Don't give a thought
Don't need them anyway

[Verse 3: Stefflon Don]
Young man comin' up from the corner
Nobody tryna say mi never wan ya
Never have to worry 'bout if he give me the banana
Me haffi tell them na na na na na
Oh no no, slide in my DMs and my wrists just froze
I'm too cold, don't wanna play 'cause I'm gettin' too old
What's new? Bitch, I'm in the stu'
Cookin' up a hurricane, mix with the flu
And they love my wrists, and my moschino pon mi coupe
The track ain't a track, don't let the Don ah come through
My rule number 1 is don't play number 2
Fucking with my nigga, you will end up on the news
Messin' with the paper that you rapped up in views
Real, real ting, all I do is tell the truth

[Chorus: Alastair]
When the cameras show up, we show out
And we can roll up and roll out
Let them think what they think, it's funny how
They didn't get it then, so they won't now
Yeah 'cause they don't know us
They can't say what they say
Don't give a thought
Don't need them anyway

[Outro: Tinie Tempah]
I know a girl from the ends
She likes to take it down low
She said she wanna let me inside
But her daddy said no
I know a girl with a woo
I call her Paris in my phone
I know a girl from the southside
Don't wanna take you all home
