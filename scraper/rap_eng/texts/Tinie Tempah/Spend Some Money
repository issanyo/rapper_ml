I'm just tryin to spend some money
These cops tryin to take it from me
(Give me that, give me that, give me that)
I'm just tryin to spend some money
(Come on, come on, come on)
These girls tryin' to take it from me
I'm up in the club with them, I'm just like what's up
Getting bottles with my niggas like we don't give a fuck
I'm just in the club, with the bottles like what's up
Spending all my fucking money like we don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: Dizzee Rascal]
Hot boy, chillin on South Beach
I got a pocket full of money and I don't speak
I let the money do the chit chat, all I do is kick back
In fact everything's intact
So I'm living it large, life large and in charge
I go hard, no time to recharge
I don't stop, I just come forth
All I see is pretty women and a lot of bottles on the rocks
I've got the premises on lock
Under the middle with a flush, actin out like I'm out
I get the party started, or so I'm told
And I feel top notch, I got the top spot
So let the bass drop, and let the drums kick
Get before a man to boost and then bump it
All the bottles are empty cause we drunk it
And I'm wasted, mission accomplished

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yea yea
Move ho, I'll be in the club, stop picking them leaves
Young niggas both sides of me, lookin like Cluedo
Bitch this is Audemars, not a Hublot
If these niggas a beat then we sumos
This the new Eubank and Frank Bruno
White girls getting pregnant like Juno
Private jet so let me go Pluto
Yeah it's a grand whole life, freakin cinematic
I'm in the SLS, fuck it if I'm in the traffic
Great stone then I lay with those 20 ratchets
Black rock star, bitches call me Lenny Kravitz

[Hook]
I'm just tryin to spend some money
These cops tryin to take it from me
(Give me that, give me that, give me that)
I'm just tryin to spend some money
(Come on, come on, come on)
These girls tryin' to take it from me
I'm up in the club with them, I'm just like what's up
Getting bottles with my niggas like we don't give a fuck
I'm just in the club, with the bottles like what's up
Spending all my fucking money like we don't' give a fuck

[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]
Grey Goose in my tummy
I'm tryin to do the doggy but it just looks funny
Still I look like money, dress to impress
Looking for some double D, breast in a low pot dress
And then I put that body to the test
North to south east, to west I progress, I'm the best
I know I ain't settling for less
She knows what I want, she ain't gotta second guess
Took her to the hotel, she was with her home girl
Had to get rid of your girl like oh well
Baby it's a cold world, get in the jacuzzi
Smoke some of this and get woozy
Think her name was Jane but it could've been Julie
Really don't matter cause I still let her do me
Really a truly, it was all that
I paid for the rat ta ta ta ta, from the back now

I'm just tryin to spend some money

I'm just tryin to spend some money

I'm up in the club with them, I'm just like what's up
Getting bottles with my niggas like we don't give a fuck
I'm just in the club, with the bottles like what's up
Spending all my fucking money like we don't' give a fuck
