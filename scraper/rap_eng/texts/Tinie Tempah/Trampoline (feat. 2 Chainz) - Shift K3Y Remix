Yeah (x3)

Eenie meanie minie
Thank God it’s Friday
Please don’t ask for my I.D
If I’m in your iTunes library
Got my own book library
My mansion is so tidy
But my neighbours hate my mistress
Cos she never wear no nightie
I go claridges to do high tea
Jordans on like Spike Lee
I’m high end, you’re high street
Swagger jacking my stylee
When I was a kid I used to save up for my Nikes
Now all these little kids are trying to save up for my Nikes

Sharing clothes that’s trampy
Splitting bills that’s trampy
All this hanky, hanky panky
Now her hand prints on my banksy
I’m just strictly speaking Anne frankly
All my girls is fancy in a white Ferrari Spider
Rolling with Anansi and Diplo to disco
She sniff Woahh
She gwan like she RiRi
Wine to calypso
She ask me if I’m single
I said may be I think so
I can’t concentrate
When that thong on like Sisqo

First of all swagging
Two girls with me so am bragging
So much money in ma pocket
My pants might be sagging
My car migt be tinted
My weed might be scented
My girl might be bow-legged
Her friend might be with her
Gold Roley on when I perform
Ring, Ring
Mobile phone the way it’s going off, it must be on
Till the break of dawn party like
Rock Stars!
We don’t stop til we see them fucking cop cars

Shake (x7)
Tambourine
Tan till her skin peel off, tangerine
Then she vogue
Agyness Deyn
On your marks, get set go
