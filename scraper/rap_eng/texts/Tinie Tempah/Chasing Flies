[Chorus: Nea]
We don't hurry
We don't hurry we got all this time
We don't hurry
We ain't worry we just wait and hide
And who cares what's going on
Just put on my favorite song
Gonna dance for you in slow mo'
Aye, we don't hurry
We don't hurry we got all this time
Chasin' flies

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
You've got me in another state of mind
You know I'd rather chose faith than the money and the fame combined
Skip an Uber we could take the underground we could waste some time
Yeah, roll a lil' some', smoke a lil' some'
May play some grime
You know I love it when you wake up high
Know you're down for that G-shit
Falling down on your knees, quick
I was all in some deep house
You was all in some deep shit
That was part of my weakness
And I give you anything you're wanting
Show you that I'm never on a long ting
Yo, this our time and we ain't rushing

[Chorus: Nea]
We don't hurry
We don't hurry we got all this time
We don't hurry
We ain't worried we just wait and hide
And who cares what's going on
Just put on my favorite song
Gonna dance for you in slow mo'
Aye, we don't hurry
We don't hurry we got all this time
Chasin' flies

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah yeah
Why am I so wavy?
Why are you so amazing?
What's up with your iPhone?
We ain't spoke up lately
I used to be your best friend
Keep you in the wave
Now you're acting shady
Girl you don't know me lately
For no reason
You ain't taking amneesin'
Try'n see if you're down girl
You're down girl and I mean it
Thought your girl for that freak
And I give you anything you're wanting
Show you that I'm never on a long ting
Girl, this our time and we ain't rushing no

[Chorus: Nea]
We don't hurry
We don't hurry we got all this time
We don't hurry
We ain't worry we just wait and hide
And who cares what's going on
Just put on my favorite song
Gonna dance for you in slow mo'
Aye, we don't hurry
We don't hurry we got all this time
Chasin' flies

[Bridge: Tinie Tempah & Nea]
I love the way you're so chill (You're so chill)
I love the way you know the deal (You know the deal, yeah)
You're the main number in my phone bill (My phone bill)
You're so real, you're so real, you're so real
I don't wanna say bye-bye (Bye, bye, bye)
Feeling' like I'm in the sky-y-y (Sky, sky, sky)
Pretty 'jay's fly in the twilight
Do you wanna ride, ride, ride, ride
