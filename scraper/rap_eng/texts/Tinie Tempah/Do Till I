[Hook]
99 problems but a bitch ain't one (Kobe)
But did you burn this god damn house right down? (Sophie)
Throw something at ya just for acting dumb (Naomi)
Show the paparazzi my bogies for being nosey
Yeah, I D.O. till I O.D
Yeah, I D.O. till I O.D
Yeah, I D.O. till I O.D
I D.O till somebody call the police
Yeah, I D.O. till I O.D
Yeah, I D.O. till I O.D
Yeah, I D.O. till I O.D
I D.O. till somebody call the police

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, who's there?
Your daddy's worst nightmare
I'm mile high club fly
Them other rappers Ryanair (I swear)
How the hell do I say this shit?
How the hell do I say this shit?
How the hell do I say this shit?
How the hell do I get away with this?
Pardon me if I swear
But what a fucking year
A lot of sex, drugs and rock and roll
But the doctors say I'm all clear
We've got girls over there
We've got girls over there
By the time the night is over
They're gonna be in their underwear
All my greedy people get ugly
Specs on like I study
Break her heart if she love me
If you ain't on the jury, don't judge me
My favourite pair of cheap Monday's
My belt Crocodile Dundee
I got David Becks on my undies
And I got a girl that lives in your country, ho

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I want to scream but I'm baritone
I'm fucking lean and I'm Sharon Stone
Straight up your Ali G, Sacha Baron Cohen
Alright, I'm doing Ellie's mansion up in Marylebone
Tell the groupies no camera phones
It costs a lot to wear rags and bones
? on that eighth floor
And bring back a bunch of tag-alongs
We run this city like marathons
Disturbing London vagabond
?
When I bang a blonde to a Cameron song
My sane people go mental
Crazy people go gentle
What you call it? Shut up prick, I call it experimental
I'm one of the UK's most influential
I don't really give a fuck if I offend you
And I've got a piece of wood in my trousers, girl
That's really easy to assemble

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah I D.O. till I O.D
On my Nintendo playing Mario and Yoshi
Yeah ordered some mutton
I'm teaching Gordon Ramsey how to make a roti
I put diamonds in my rose wreath
Cleanup on aisle five to mosh pits in row three
Put your fucking hands up like a goalie
I O.D. on Ozs but this is poetry
