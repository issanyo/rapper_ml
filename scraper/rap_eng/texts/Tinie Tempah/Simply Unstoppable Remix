Simple
Honey, I'm a fine boy, no pimples
I've done deja-vu and done dimples
And fuckin everybody wants me on their single
My mommy 44 years with no wrinkles
I got a hundred thousand on me I can sprinkle
All year my house covered in tinsel
I go pop and I won't stop, simple
Yeah

So involved in this moment, I can't let go
(Tik tok, check my Roley wrist watch
Fuck how much a drink cost, we about to take off)
It's outrageous and sophisticated it's all in the air...
(The big boss, make em jump like Kriss Kross
Girl you better turn me on cos I'm about to switch off)

I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this
So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable
I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this
So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable

I think I should remind 'em
I'm about to clean up like a Dyson
'Cause I just say how it is like Simon
I like the taste of alcohol, I got wine gums
I don't ever wanna hear another siren
Them high-rises can block your horizon
Disturbing London is the city that I'm from
Where if we like the tune, we make the DJ rewind 'em

So involved in this moment, I can't let go
(Tik tok, check my Roley wrist watch
Fuck how much a drink cost, we about to take off like...)
It's outrageous and sophisticated it's all in the air...
(The big boss, make em jump like Kriss Kross
Girl you better turn me on cos I'm about to switch off)

I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this
So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable
I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this
So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable

Yeah, Yeah, I betta make em say Oooh
Keeping Travis on my table
I said no to like 6 or 7 labels
I used to sit next to Rachel in Staples
My fans are crazy with stencils and staples
I came to cause a bit of chaos and to break rules
If it ain't me, it ain't cool
Eh baby, bring another bottle to the table

Yeah, yeah

I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this
So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable
I can't explain it, but you're gonna love this
So crazy outrageous, simply unstoppable
