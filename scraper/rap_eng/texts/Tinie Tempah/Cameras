[Chorus: David Stewart]
Cameras flashing
Cameras flashing
And they all for you
They all for you, oh

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, more photogenic than we'll ever be
Sure I see your mama but that shit don't seem heredity
Take you out for dinner, you say feelings is your recipe
You ain't even think what you gon' look like when you 70
I knew it, you say everybody do it
That's just rumours
If it's true, let 'em do it, girl
'Cause everyone that knew you, like that
You like it, yeah, I know you love that shit
Club promoters in your DMs, tell me how you got that shit
Say you summer European, Monaco
Used to say I'm comin' over, Dominos straight to your crib
On your blog, baby, what's your plan's labryinth
When I said I just made a banger with Labrinth

[Chorus: David Stewart]
Cameras flashing, oh, hey
Cameras flashing, oh, hey
And they all for you, all for you
They all for you, oh
I don't need no flashing to know you're a star, babe, oh
'Cause when you walk in the room, it's obvious who you are, oh yeah
Baby, they all for you
Baby, they all for you

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, your mama just take down her Majesty
Change your imperfections but perfection has no guarantee
Wishin' on a star, faded underneath the canopy
A* student, how you turn into the baddest B?
Woo, babe, I never had a clue
Drive through Warwick Avenue, high on fumes
Playin' Darkside of the moon, yeah
You like it but you ain't a groupie though
Used to say I move too flakey, I was in the studio
Tried to help with your career , went out your ear and through your nose
You say lately you just feel like you been on the Truman show
When you say I'm makin' bands in Milan, watchin' Edward Scissor-
Hands, I didn't get it then but now, I understand, yeah

[Chorus: David Stewart]
Cameras flashing, oh, hey
Cameras flashing, oh, hey
And they all for you, all for you
They all for you, oh
I don't need no flashing to know you're a star, babe, oh
'Cause when you walk in the room, it's obvious who you are, oh yeah
Baby, they all for you
Baby, they all for you

[Outro: Tinie Tempah]
(Cameras) I know you like me, baby
(Flashing) I know I drive you crazy
(Cameras) You love that Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
(Flashing) You love that Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
What's up, baby? Hold up
You say you need to get this dough up
You claim you treat me different but I know you don't
Yeah, you always say you listen but I know you won't
I know you won't, yeah
I know you won't, yeah
You say you will, yeah
I know you won't, yeah
I know you won't, yeah
I know you won't
