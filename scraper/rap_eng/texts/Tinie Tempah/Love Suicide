[Ad Lib: Ester Dean]
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, love suicide is killing me
You're getting into my head
You're like a guillotine
You've got my gasping for air in your vicinity
And now your saying somethings
That you don't really mean
That's really mean
How the hell I'm caught up in between?
Devils advocate trying not to intervene
Putting up a front like it ain't a thing to me
I swear its gotta be the worst position to be in, be in
I guess you feel like you've been ignored
And your perfect picture torn into a jigsaw
Cause when your 'round me you get a little withdrawn
And we just can't seem to find time to sit and talk
I know she isn't sure...

[Refrain: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, what happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house
And everything becomes so cold
Baby thats the only I wanna know

[Hook: Ester Dean]
Tell me the reason why
You committed love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it purpose
I'm all out of tears
Time to get out of here
You made it very clear
You did it on purpose

[Ad Lib: Ester Dean]
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
I feel like I'm about to break down
Why you acting like a kid up in a playground?
If you got something on your mind why don't you lay it out?
Feels like the end of us is coming any day now, any day
I thought we'd never separate
I could be destroyed but not defeated Ernest Hemingway
You know its probably for the best anyway
Cause my suspicions now is worrying your jealous face
Let's go our separate way...

[Refrain]
Uh, what happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house
And everything becomes so cold
Baby thats the only I wanna know

[Hook: Ester Dean]
Tell me the reason why
You committed love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it purpose
I'm all out of tears
Time to get out of here
You made it very clear
You did it on purpose

[Ad Lib: Ester Dean]
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Why would you hurt us?
Our love suicide
Our love suicide
Our love suicide

[Bridge: Ester Dean]
Does it make you happy, to see me down?
Does it make your day, to see me drown?
I guess I'm your entertainment
You don't know what you wasted
But soon you will see.. yeah!

[Refrain 2: Tinie Tempah]
What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Within four walls and and one house
And everything becomes so cold
Baby thats the only thing I wanna know!

[Hook: Ester Dean]
Tell me the reason why
You committed love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears
Time to get out of here
You made it very clear
You did it on purpose, purpose!
You did it on purpose, purpose!
You made me feel worthless, worthless
Why would you hurt us, hurt us!
You did it on purpose, purpose!
You did it on purpose, purpose!
You made me feel worthless, worthless
Why would you hurt us, hurt us!

What happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house
And everything becomes so cold!
