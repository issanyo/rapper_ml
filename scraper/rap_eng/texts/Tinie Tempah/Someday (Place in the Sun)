[Hook: Ella Eyre]
They never have time to give you
They’re always on the run
But you keep on working for your place in the sun
When the lights go out in London
Your work has just begun
Someday you will find your place in the sun
Find a place in the sun
Find a place in the sun

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Back to the beginning, in fact no we’re winning
Thanks to the spectacular raps that I’m scribbling
It’s ‘Bachs that I’m driven in
Plaques in my living room
The stats match the facts, man, I'm back, back, back, back
Mama look we made it out the flats we was living in
Times I nearly thought I would collapse living in Britian
Smiling in pictures
Flying to fixtures
Never in denial cos the Nile is a river
Rappers on the sly try’na eye my elixir
Jealousy’s a crime bet your pride won’t resist ‘ya
To get to where I am I cried like I was injured
Bled like a soldier perspired like a sprinter
Brother said T keep an eye out from them rinsers
People that you hang with are trying to lynch ya
Never break down
I’ll be there to lift ya
You’re perfect how you are so why they trying to fix ya

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Away from the pain and the sadness
Soon the whole world is gonna understand my language
Everybody’s try’na find a method to the madness
Wankers hating on me ‘cos I did it single handed
Whatever will be will be even if you plan it
On the road to success but feeling like I’m stranded
Disturbing London ho, I don’t speak no other language
Started with a goal and then I ended with a hat-trick
Selling out arenas think it’s time to do a new tour
Pennies for the thoughts that I’m about to give you food for
Never show emotion even on a mood board
Sold my bandwagon then I went and bought a two door
Dizzee made me rap and rider made me get my groove on
I just wanna hit a billion views and do a tune Sean
Thinking ’bout life listening to too short
One day they’ll have a statue of me in Madame Tussauds

[Hook]

[Bridge: Tinie Tempah]
For that spot I’ma use Cruella Deville power
Or do a Willow and Jaden and use my willpower
Victory is the sweetest defeat is real sour
Together we can move mountains rebuild towers
A lot of hurt still waiting for God to heal ours
Stand up and rebel again the real cowards

[Hook]
They never have time to give you
They’re always on the run (on the run)
But you keep on working for your place in the sun
When the lights go out in London (Disturbing London)
Your work has just begun (we’ve just begun)
Someday you will find your place in the sun
