[Intro x2]
Driving a German whip
Driving a German whip
Driving a German whip
Driving a German whip

[Hook x2]
If you see man driving a German whip
Blacked out window, leaning back
See man driving a German whip
Look like a baller, Ps and that
I don't kick ball, do I look like a baller?
See man driving a German whip
Who told you I move like pauper?
See man driving a German whip

[Verse]
See man driving a German, Dan, Tess Daly, Vernon
And I fly upper on Virgin, fans go mad when they see me and a person
Fans go mad when they see me in a- mad when they see me in a new S-class with a curtain
I get my ish from Burberry, I get my ish from Burton, Burton, Burton
Tryna lead out I'm in my car [?], feeling like Branson when I'm outing
Knocking em out here while I'm standing, shouting, never your Instagram pouting
Some are just lazy soldiers, fool, I'm a groundbreaker, I'mma break rules
I wouldn't rate none of you man in my school, I wouldn't rate none of you man in my school
You fool, think you're a big man tryna act cool?
I will break a man's sinus, buss his hairline back, no exception to the rule
I'm on an amber wasting fuel, new Roley - amazing jewel
Would you like March if you may any day could be your April fool?
I'm like everything I ride is German, everything I ride got germs on
Cause I'm a sick youth from London, that's where I wanna keep disturbing
And I know all three Big Seans, that's why you always see me swerving
Bars so fast you be feeling that turbulence, car's so hard it's got a definite tolerance
