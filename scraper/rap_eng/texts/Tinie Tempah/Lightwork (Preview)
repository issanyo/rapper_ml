[? = Word not clear][__  = unsure of word]
[Verse 1]
Yo, yo
Coming from the south side with the slang ghetto
I got a zebra in my house and an antelope
Been round the world, doing __ steve angelo

[Verse 2]
Rocking white gold, pink gold and yellow
__ dizzee? Man, I used to want to rock echo
See the crib, keep that shit so art deco
And I don't want another dark place? special
I make her? feel so good that she can't say no

[Verse 3]
Getting wasted at my rap party
I could've shagged __, man I should've shagged carly
Could've? spent the weekend with my Black Barbie

[... Parts missing unfortunately, including verse with kalamari etc.]

[Verse 6/7?]
See the hints?, lightwork
Long __, has got my life? on? my life up?
I just did it for the kids, _________
Getting paid, __ ___?
I got broads in Atlanta that are by designer

Uh, now these haters wanna jump ship
No more books? we __ niggas, __ fuck with

[Hook - Assumed this as Tinie said it was at a live performance, see YT vid.]

[I presume there is more to the song, since this in total only lasts around 1 minute 20 seconds. If anyone can add anything, it would be much appreciated. Thanks.]
