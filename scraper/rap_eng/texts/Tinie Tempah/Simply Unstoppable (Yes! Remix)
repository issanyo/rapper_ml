[VERSE 1]
Simple
Honey, I'm a fine boy, no pimples
I've done deja-vu and done ding wars
And fucking everybody wants me on their single
My mummy 44 years and no wrinkles
I got a hundred thousand on me I can sprinkle
All year my house covered in tinsel
I've gone pop and I won't stop simple
Yeah!

[HOOK] (Tinie Tempah)
So involved in this moment, I can't let it go
(Tick tock, check my Roley wrist watch
Fuck how much a drink cost, we about to kick off)
It's outrageous and so-phisticated it's all in the air...
(The big boss, leave 'em sounding wish-wash
Girl you better turn me on cause I'm about to switch off)
I can't explain it, (cool!), but you're gunna love this, (yes!)
So crazy outrageous, (big!), simply unstoppable, (fresh!) (X2)

[VERSE 2]
Let's go!
I think I should remind 'em
I'm about to clean up like a Dyson
Cause I just say how it is like Simon
I like the taste of alcohol I got wine gums
I don't ever wanna hear another siren
Them highrises can block your horizon
Disturbing London is the city that I'm from
Where if we like the tune, we make the DJ rewind em

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
Yeah, Yeah, I betta make em say Oooh
Kate & Travis on my table
I said no to like 6 or 7 labels
I used to sit next to Rachel in St. Paul's
My fans are crazy with stencils and staples
I came to cause a bit of chaos and to break rules
If it ain't me, it ain't cool
Eh baby, bring another bottle to the table

Yeah .. Yeah ..

[HOOK]
