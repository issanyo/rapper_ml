[Intro]
I make hitz, not the public
I tell the DJs what to play! Understand?

[Verse 1]
Uh!
Baa baa black sheep, rock star, rap G
Make enough dough to own a black card, that's deep
I've been getting real fucking friendly with the banks man
And I don't mean Phil, Carlton, Hilary or Ashley
Papz see me up in the vicinity and flash me
I'm the definition of definitive and catchy
The only thing that's bigger, quicker, slicker
More black and more upper London is a taxi
Bitch I'm so sick, I need a mother fucking vaccine
Pinky ring shine like some mother fucking vaseline
Centre of attention like a Bang & Olufsen
HD (scratch) in vision for a flat screen
The only ever time I see you niggas on Kiss is like 2am or when you go to pucker up
Nought to sixty in four, babe you need to buckle up
All my women so Zoo, all my women so Nuts

[Hook]
I make hitz, not the public
I tell the DJs what to play! Understand?

[Verse 2]
So raw and uncut no fucking edits
She won't even get a hype, she made no fucking effort
And all you silly singers and you ring tone rappers
Like school dinner curries
Don't fucking get it
My car is a unleaded
Got a yard with a terrace
She called me chauvinistic
But she can't even spell it
I don't wanna hear another nigga say you fly
If you ain't never been on business class on the Emirates
I'm a racket, I'm tennis
I'm Dennis, I'm a menace
Call me Rob Pattinson, I got a lot of niggas jealous
I'm a Mentos mint in a can of Dr. Pepper
That's tick, tick, tick, tick, boom to you fellas
Tom Ford, nigga, Martin Margiela
Ain't lipsing if her name ain't Remi or Stella
Got a big bag of tricks and Mary Poppins' umbrella
Cause we're 'bout to rain on them like London weather

[Hook]
