[Verse 1]
Yeah, said hi, she said hello
Her body bangin', her body for string fellows
Chop deals, cop wheels and sip mellow
Get knocked billed, you pop pills to get mellow
White boys tryna be black, all fellow
Black boys tryna be white like Baron Bellew
Hit Trotters, they spotted the new kettle
I said Coldplay cause it was all Yellow
Shift K3Y in with the bass, I need the treble
D first came in with the dates, I need the schedule
I'mma last, check if we scored, that need a medal
DJ's ringin' me up, they want a special
Yeah, wild women wanna wrestle
Put vanilla on the bezzle
I'm the nigga on the level
Need to shake it like jello
And I was like hello

Don't tell oh, the hotel-o, they so jello
Oh hello, check you in your stilettos

Grade two, they listed my Martello
Love wine, we love cheers and my demos
Slender, no agenda, no MO

She wanna give me to the Pisces
B got tickets, she got a Chinese
Ball so hard, motherfucker's on her family
Ball so hard, double up, don't wanna try me
Uh, switch it up, another style-y
Ask her how much she rate me, she say highly
Dark skin girls and the lighties, yeah
