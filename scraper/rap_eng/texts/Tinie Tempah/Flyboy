[Intro: Mercston]
Flyboy
I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy
(All day, everyday)
I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy

[Verse 1: Scorcher]
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy
First off, let me say suck your mum
To anyone chatting 'bout my boy
And if you don't know Mercston
Let me tell you (I'm a flyboy)
My man's something like I, boy
I ain't got two wings
But I've got two tings on the sly, boy
I get gash on the daily, ask Kadey
Round here (I'm a flyboy)
And I might come across shy, but
When girls come across I, then
She might be unfaithful in the blink of an eye
Blud, after the first time, she'll be like Scorch
(I'm a flyboy) Nuttin' ain't changed for the tie, boy
Still got gash technique, I'm a two-at-a-time boy
Usually smooth with the lines, boys
Something like Mercs round here

[Hook: Mercston]
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy

[Verse 2: Wiley]
I'm a flyboy, had a alpha before fly boy
Your boy's never seen money like flyboy
He's not a badman, when I caught him on the road
He looks at my face and just sly boy, (I'm a flyboy)
Who's fly?, I'm the reason why any one of you pricks can talk
I'm in the sky boy
And I don't care who the best white boy is
It's still Scatchy and Devz can't deny boy, (I'm a flyboy)
Who's [], you won't lose your life boy
And when he lands, I won't be up to the times
I'll be up all the times like my boy
Your boy, you and your crew, you can't try boy, (I'm a flyboy)
I'm the king that you won't get by boy
Freak with the night banger
Few new girls come back to my house like why boy?
'cos I'm a fly boy, and all your girls say no, I'm a fly boy

[Hook: Merston]
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
I told guys on the [] remix
That I fly like []
I passed the grime test first time
No one blessed, how can a I [] other guy's []
So you could say (I'm a flyboy)
No [] 'cos I passed the test with flying colours
Highly I choose not to rely on others
Get high with your lovers
Then I might [] in covers, (I'm a flyboy)
I'm the best white black boy
Facts, 'cos they talk short, dark light boy
I don't fight boys, I beat up men
Daytime, midday, in the night boy (I'm a flyboy)
They say that you can do anything you want with your man boy
So pass me a jet to [], home at her neck
And I'm pretty sure that (I'm a flyboy)

[Hook: Mercston]
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy
I'm a flyboy, I'm a flyboy
