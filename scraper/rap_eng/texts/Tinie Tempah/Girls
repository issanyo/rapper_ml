[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Okay, ha!
So we pop bottles one, bottle two, bottle three
Me and D chilling in the VIP
With CC, Kol B and Richie
Getting drunk off of Dop-E and Hennasy
What the MC's see on Tenerife
We drink LP's at least ten a week
I look young but the bouncer's know the D
So they never ask me to see ID
Ha, I'm a VIP
I wear a plain t-shirt they see my jeans
Truly religious, so I wear true religus
And they're authentic you can see by the seems
In by twelve so we leave by three
And there's one pretty girls sitting beside me
And he's like 'T'
And she's wifey
So he's like 'B'
But she likes me

[Hook: Calvin Harris And Tinie Tempah]
I get all the girls while you're on the go
I can't help it
I get all the girls while you're on the go
Tell the doctor I need help quick
I get all the girls while you're on the go
Cause mandem think that I'm selfish
I get all the girls while you're on the go
But the girls just think that I'm well fit

I get all the girls while you're on the go
I can't help it
I get all the girls while you're on the go
Tell the doctor I need help quick
I get all the girls while you're on the go
Cause mandem think that im selfish
I get all the girls while you're on the go
But the girls just think say im smooth like velvet

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Girls and Tinie
They go together like pearls and diamonds
They know I'm better than Earl and Symonds
Jeff Tonvoy, Herk and Clive
I could go on forever like
Jeremy, Jason, Woodrow each other
Ey girls listen up
You could know the breddas
I ain't a cheapskate
I got money
Can't spend though
Won the lottery on a sweepstake
I don't laze around
You know me
Make busy weekends busier on the weekdays
I don't smell funny
I make sure I put on Chanel as you're a CK
I wear Calvin, I noyd Calvin
Feature one two on my album
Cos I like white girls like talcan
And I like black girls like malcom

[Hook]

[Hook: Calvin Harris]
Black girls
I like them white girls
I like them asian girls
I like them mixed race girls
I like them Spanish girls
I like them Italian girls
I like the French girls
And I like Scandinavian girls
I like them tall girls
I like them short girls
I like them brown haired girls
I like them blond haired girls
I like them big girls
I like them skinny girls
I like them carrying a little bitty weight girls

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I like them red haired girls
And I LOVE them puny girls
Don't knock a lot of jewellery girls
Cos youre teeth are the pearls and you're eyes are the rubies
And I get hard from the sight of you're boobies
Then im like 'Mike, call the girl in the blue jeans'
And then im like 'Fuck the drinks, just give me two of these'
We can have fun just you and me
At home I got a TV like a movie screen
I like them quirky girls
And I love girls that help on the booty scene
And I want a girl that can dance
But I don't make a attempt at a jug, your bluey cream
I speech girls so beautifully
Like let's fly away just you and me
So we can buy perfume duty free
That's why when I'm out usually

[Hook: Calvin Harris]
I get all the girls while you're on the go
I get all the girls while you're on the go
I get all the girls while you're on the go
I get all the girls while you're on the go
