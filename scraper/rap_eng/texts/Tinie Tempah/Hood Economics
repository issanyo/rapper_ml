[Intro: Tinie Tempah]
I'm getting sick of making love tunes to make love to
So I'm gonna do this one more tune and send it out to the thugs too

Yeah!
Haha
Tinie Tempah
Ha
Oi Flukes you're a genius for this one!
Ha Ha

Hood Economics
Room 147
Welcome to my classroom
Tuck your chairs in
Sit up straight
No talking please!

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
See me I try and stay focused
Cos I've noticed
I'm no longer a novice
Make them know this
I'm hoping for the Ferrari and the Lotus
I'm gonna stack my bread like Hovis
Find an R&B chick like Hova's
I'm finally on my feet and
I feel comfortable just like loafers
It was months ago deep on the estates
Of London I arose and now designers keep on begging D to clothe us
You're busy doing raves
I'm doing concerts
I'm in Asia chewing lobster
These clothes have got me looking like I'm sponsored
I'm constant, you're nonsense
I'm respected like the [?]
From Wembley to Wisconsin (T)
I've got them listeners locked in
I want them glistening watches
Girls want me as their husbands, they're clocking!
But I ain't really got no time to watch them
Cause

[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
I'm on the grind from 9-5 [HOOD]
From 5-9 from 9-3 from [E]
3-6. I literally [CO]
Leak the hits
I literally [NOMICS]
Leak the hits
From March to May and May [ROOM]
To June, May June July I make the [1]
Tunes, I ain't gonna [4]
Wait for soon right now is my day to bloom! [7]

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
I still remain on top of these
And honestly
Nobody's a lot for me
My promise and my policy is
To become a monopoly
I've done shows for heavy sums, I've made songs that Jenny's spun
Models, I've been with plenty
And I'm still under 21
So still, I'm very young
But I put those [?] on every song
That's what got my debut on every tongue
I'm bathing in fountains
[?] made another thousand
Know a lot of money makers
Salesman and accountants
[?]
Tales that I'm announcing
We gotI ta
I'm taking other's bouncers
I'm gonna cause an economic problem
If my music keeps takes other crowds in

[Hook]

The odds are too high, don't put your money on it
Don't put your money on it, I know I'll win the bet like Sway
I'm a vet like Dre
I'm so crazy and reckless
It's in my DNA
And if you can't see that I'm merking
Then go to Specsavers or DNA
I'm moving on road like DNA
I don't answer poll like DNA
You're pissed cause your little boy said he wants to be like me
I was bound to big for my DNA
Give buy me shit with their EMA
Give me a few years, I'll have some MOBOs, a Brit
