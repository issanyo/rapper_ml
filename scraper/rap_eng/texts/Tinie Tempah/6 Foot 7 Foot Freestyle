[Intro]

[Hook]
6 foot, 7 foot, 8 foot bunch
6-6 foot, 7 foot, 8 foot bunch

[Verse 1]
Man, fuck them other rappers
I don’t hear no-one thats sounding good
Call me the wolf, I got a little red riding hood
When we in the club, them women try to push and try to look
If the drink don’t do it, than I bet them fucking diamonds would
I’m off the rails, nigga I’m a head case
Tryna take it to another level like a stair case
Traded in a thousand times to be a millionaire mate
I take off and land in a very private air space

A-yo pull that back man, a-yo play that again, man
You know what I'm saying?

(Repeat hook and verse 1)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm crazy and insane, crazy and deranged
I'm so far ahead they tryna chase me in a train
Got them other rappers feeling lazy and ashamed
You know you’re doing something right when Jay-Z knows your name
And I ain't bothered by the fame but I’m addicted to this lifestyle
Girls so starstruck she write her number twice down
All I see is numbers I don’t fucking waste time nigga
All I do is numbers call me 789
