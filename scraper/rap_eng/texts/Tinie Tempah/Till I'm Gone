[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I grew tired, of the same, then one night, packed my things
Told the one I love, "I’ll be back one day"
Through the fight, through the pain, booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry, I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone
'Til I’m gone, 'til I’m gone

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
I buy time in Switzerland, I drive round in Monaco
I shook hands with Royalty I make songs that monarchs know
Ti ti ti la so fa, mi mi mi mi re do
Call me Aloe Blacc cause I need that dollar yo
Hic-hic-hiccup, blame it on the liquor
I came through like a stick up now I’m balling like a kick up
I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of "Nip Tuck"
And yes I am the best man, I’m so sorry 'bout the mix-up

[Pre-Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Let's do it all today and worry 'bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill, you know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I grew tired, of the same, then one night, packed my things
Told the one I love, "I’ll be back one day"
Through the fight, through the pain, booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry, I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone
'Til I’m gone, 'til I’m gone

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
But I won't be gone for too long

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
In Amsterdam, haha, and Milan
Just came off Aussie tour, you’ll never see this singer poor
I’m the one like 2 plus 3, m-m-m-minus four
Fe-fe-fe-fi-fo-fum, every time I climb the stalk
Yeh, yeh, I’m on it, I landed in a rocket
With a crown inside my watch and silver peace sign on my bonnet
You don’t need a thermometer to tell you who’s the hottest
Ip dip do motherfucker, you are not it

[Pre-Chorus: Tinie Tempah]
Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Let's do it all today and worry 'bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill, you know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I grew tired, of the same, then one night, packed my things
Told the one I love, "I’ll be back one day"
Through the fight, through the pain, booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry, I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone
'Til I’m gone, 'til I’m gone

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
But I won't be gone for too long

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Okay I’m in it, I’m in it to the finish
I keep them bottles coming like my card ain't got no limit
Got some friends that playing football
And some friends that playing cricket
And a mistress that is fine like a fucking parking ticket
Haha, I said I’m in it, I’m in it 'til the finish
I keep them bottles coming 'til there ain't nothing in it
I’m like Mario on mushrooms, I’m like Popeye on some spinach
We gon keep it coming 'til I no speaka no English, ahh!

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I grew tired, of the same, then one night, packed my things
Told the one I love, "I’ll be back one day"
Through the fight, through the pain, booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry, I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I’ll be going 'til I’m gone
'Til I’m gone, 'til I’m gone

[Post-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
But I won't be gone for too long
