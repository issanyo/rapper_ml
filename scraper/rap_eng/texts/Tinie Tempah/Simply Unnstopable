[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah, simple
Honey, I'm a fine boy, no pimples
I've done deja-vu and done dingles
And fucking everybody wants me on their single
My mum 44 years with no wrinkles
I got a hundred thousand on me I can sprinkle
All year my house covered in tinsel
I've gone pop and I won't stop pringles

[Hook]
So involved in this moment, I can't let it go
Tik tok, check my Roley wrist watch
Fuck how much a drink cost, we about to kick off like
It's outrageous and sophisticated, it's all in the air
The big boss make 'em jump like Kriss Kross
Girl, you better turn me on cause I'm about to switch off

I can't explain it, cool
But you're gonna love this, yes
So crazy outrageous
Simply unstoppable, fresh (2x)

[Verse 2]
I think I should remind 'em
I'm about to clean up like a Dyson
Cause I just say how it is like Simon
I like the taste of alcohol, I got wine gums
I don't ever wanna hear another siren
Them high rises can block your horizon
Disturbing London is the city that I'm from
Where if we like the tune, we make the DJ rewind 'em, yeah

[Hook]

I can't explain it, cool
But you're gonna love this, yes
So crazy outrageous
Simply unstoppable, fresh

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I better make 'em say, ooh
Some Aliz√© and some Grey Goose
I said no to like six or seven labels
I used to sit next to Rachel in Saint Paul's
My fans are crazy with stencils and staples
I came to cause a bit of chaos and to break rules
If you ain't me, you it ain't cool
Hey baby, bring another bottle to the table

[Outro]
I can't explain it, cool
But you're gonna love this, yes
So crazy outrageous
Simply unstoppable, fresh (2x)

Cool
Yes
Fresh
