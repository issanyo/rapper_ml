[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yo, spillin' juice, I'm wavey
My livin' room is crazy
I preed your life on Instagram
And niggas too fugazy
Gettin' millions from the Majors
You niggas ain't behavin'
Them boys is under pressure
I'm a fuckin' freak of nature
Yo, yo, it's all gold medallion
My dover's so, so Italian
I drove my Italian
You hate the fact I'm known on fashion
Yeah, yeah, it's all clear money
All the same jeans
All the same fiends
All the same dreams
Told my nigga we all the same, all the same
Yeah, we all the same breed
Came up with all the same, always trained
Stuck with all the same team
And my niggas got drama for a pussy
You know that pussy ain't free
I bet he gon' know you fuck with some trill ones
When you see the lazerbeam
I'm the king of this Twitter age
I used to give a fuck, now any pricks can say their peace
So now I hit sport mode in my Huracán
When I zip from A to B
I think I might slide out to my hideout, where it's 58 degrees
All my niggas interested, in some next shit
Lets get' rich and this ain't beef, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Tiggs Da Author]
Used to run around with them hoes you must know
Now I mess with bitches that I don't even know
Rollin' with my G's, screamin' fuck how you feel
We no say no names, if you know, then you know
If you know, then you know
If you know, then you know
I say, we no say no names, if you know, then you know
If you know, then you know
If you know, then you know
I say, we no say no names, if you know, then you know

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, so wavey, I should be on TIDAL
I swear down on the Bible
I swear we goin' viral
Y'all niggas got more ones than Michael
Fuck, baby, more ones than Michael Jackson
Them haters think I'm handsome
I knew them boys were paigons
When I saw their interactions
Yeah, nigga, it's all over zaphy
Champagne from Fortnum & Mason
I just tour and hit the basement
Pick a draw up from the station
Yeah, nigga, it's all clean money
Doin' all the same deeds
Wearin' all the same drees
Yeah, all the same steeze
Tell a nigga don't spud me if you don't love me
You can't call and stay please
I ain't pushin' no mixtape, it's done jack shit
Yeah I done more than they tweet
Ayy nigga, like fuck you, I do Junk food
But I don't walk away from beef
You might end up on Snapchat tryna backtrack
When you all the way in grease
We ain't feelin' your sound
You know it don't sound like new new
You know my shit sound
You know my shit sound like voodoo, woo
G63, bitch, play it to the BlueTooth
You niggas can't see me like Mewtwo
Mind out who you dealin' with
Know theres niggas out here stealin' shit
I'm always in the dealership
Smellin' good, feelin' ripped
DL, the realest clique
Imhotep, the realest clique
Always in the trillest shit
Always on some illest shit
Professor in the laboratory
I got millis comin' andelé
I like the way she wine to house
I'm tryna come on Valerie
Borderline insanity
I bet your daughter wanna marry me
Always burnin' calories
Flexin' like we used to, ayy

[Chorus: Tiggs Da Author]
Used to run around with them hoes you must know
Now I mess with bitches that I don't even know
Rollin' with my G's, screamin' fuck how you feel
We no say no names, if you know, then you know
If you know, then you know
If you know, then you know
I say, we no say no names, if you know, then you know
If you know, then you know
If you know, then you know
I say, we no say no names, if you know, then you know
