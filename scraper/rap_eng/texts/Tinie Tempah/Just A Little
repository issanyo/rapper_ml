[Hook: Range]
I don't want to think about you
All day long
I don't want to dream about you
Girl I do miss you
Just a little (x3)
Okay, maybe more than just a little bit

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah
I'm done confusing you girl
We both come from two different worlds
And you don't wanna come around mine
But what happened that night was the usual drill
Head over heels, got your head over heels
How many times did I say I'm no good?
Girl, even your friends know the deal
So why you phonin' me still?
If you don't hear no evil, then you won't see no evil
Girl, I don't wanna be no hero
We had a little fling on the d-low
And I ain't really sure how I feel so
I'm in the club with a bottle of verve cliquot
I can't let you be my ego

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Maybe I'm used to pain
Love is a losing game
Why'd I let you feel the flame?
I think I'm falling, I refuse to say
This is never going to work at all
First of all, it's too personal
So when you phone me I've got to divert the call
Because when you take the leap you're going to fly the fall, and I
Don't want to deal with the commotion, I don't do commitments
I don't do devotion
That's why you sent a letter to me that I never opened
Give me space to breathe so I can deal with my emotions

[Hook]

Just a little

You know, you know it's more than just a little bit
