[Hook: Stormzy]
Look, rudeboy, I've been the man
Even when I was in the pram
Way before your Insta bang
Furthermore, before that Instagram
I'm just tryna get love, when I'm in Japan
I make the girl dem sing for man
Every MC wanna spin the man
But I kill a soundboy like I'm Ninjaman

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Look, rudeboy, I've been the man
Even way before Twitter, fam
Act like you ain't been a fan
You get a déjà-vu when I rinse a man
And get messy when I Lionel twist a man
Bare likes on my Insta jam
Thug life when I spit on the cam
I tell a man sit down, ain't taking a jab
Cuh man are hot for the EP, hot for the radio
Mind that you don't get boxed in your rave clothes
I was on my boss' yacht after the Spain show
Ask Sony why they dropped the potato
How comes I always hear my name on Not For The Radio
When man ain't never been on Not For The Radio?
If them man are pagans then I've got a halo
Better than me? Yeah, go on then, say so
Cause you ain't Dizzee or Will or Kano
Don't care if you got tats, OK bro
And the very first mixtape manaman's heard is all mine
Said in '06, '07 what I said in '09
Now it's 2015 and man are still winning
You man are just fakes, them man are just kidding
Shout out to them man Disturbing London, you know how we living
Have I gotta tell man six times on a one
Number 1, I’m still winning

Look, rudeboy, I've been the man

[Verse 2: Jme]
Yeah, look, rudeboy, I've been the man
(Yeah) The final boss, yeah, I've been him too
Favourite MC, yeah, I spin him too
It's me your bredrin's listening to
The next step? Make my own crep
Yeah, not the crêpe that you eat
The creps on your feet, I trend-set, see
That means nobody can crep check me
(Shut ya mout) Oh please
Man ripped up the Ts and Cs
In my black hoodie and my off-white tee
With my black gums and my off-white teeth
Vegan, I don't chat about beef
Cause I know beef is bull and I'm not a chief
If I catch man moving backwards
Punch man in all of his chakras
Yeah, sorry, I don't rehearse
Fuck a soundcheck, it only gets worse
"Man Don't Care", end up in a hearse
If you don't reload Giggs' verse
Good guy but I'm not a saint
Thought I was coming offstage but I ain't
Them two girls at the front gonna faint
Set gets cancelled, still get paid (raggo)
Everyone's got ideas
Force them on me, it will end in tears (raggo)
Everyone's trying to get to the top of the stairs
But it's bless down here (raggo)
Fuck am I meant to do, blud?
Spitting from 2002, blud
Seen Integri-Tee?
If it's not me, then who, blud?

[Verse 3: Ms Banks]
Yeah, I've been the girl
Same chick make your Mr twirl
I ain't talking 'bout a jewellery shop hit
When I say he wan' lick the pearl
And I heard them girls been talking shit
Your track sounds like a hit and miss
Yeah, I MC but why would I make a diss?
Fuck the track, I'll spin your wig
'Nough chat when they're online
Real life, cool, fine
I'm pretty, looking like I'm from Ice City
But I'll scrap, I ain't got a nine
So just fall back, take time
I spit crack, sniff lines
That raw, uncut, leave your mind fucked
I'm en route but he missed the sign
I'm en route to the money
Yardie man say I'm tunny
Bad but I can't be bummy
Shit ain't funny, I've been out there till it's sunny
Tryna get a bit of cheddar for my mummy
Tell a man be easy
They wanna touch me, tease me
You little niggas can't please me
You mandem are sleazy
You need to go to the GP
About your talking greazy
I tell a man just dead it
Better nuh bring to life if I said it
You know you ain't fucking with us so don't beg it
Anytime I spit, I deliver, I'm so fearless
I've had enough, in my hood, we never had much
Moving grub to fill up my cup, so tell me what's up
Like a bandage, we in the cut
While you're busy stuck in the mud, uh
