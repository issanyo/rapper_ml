[Chrous: Shakka]
From the speed dial, I'ma call her
She no drama, she no drama
In the winter or the summer
She no drama, she no drama
She don't like no fakes, she keep it real
She ain't on a wave , she know the deal
In the winter or the summer
She no drama, she no drama

[Verse 1: Not3s]
On the beat I can be a madman
But now she robbin' me like she be a badman
And I get dough I don't need a trapman
But now she wanna know cause all my P's in Santan
Man I knew that she won't fake
I undergo and I seen em' when I blink
Like bring this ship, my wave will make you sink, Nah
When you ride my wave will make you sink la, la
We used to kick it in the kitchen when we were all on our own
Put her on the oven, it got too hot on the stove
And now the bond gets old
She was too much drama so I left her on her own, yeah yeah

[Chrous: Shakka]
From the speed dial , I'ma call her
She no drama, she no drama
In the winter or the summer
She no drama, she no drama
She don't like no fakes, she keep it real
She ain't on a wave , she know the deal
In the winter or the summer
She no drama, she no drama

[Verse 2: Shakka]
Oooh lord
I'ma catch some feelings
Living on the gram preein'
I'ma catch some feelings
She be on the gym ting
All the squats, they ain't helping
Call my phone, like take a break
Let me fix you something, fam
Mixing on the kitchen, she can throw down
I remember [?] she couldn't calm down
Usain Bolt with the tongue, always running mouth
[?] the crackpot
Baby please, baby please, baby please
Leave my belt
Tryna be, tryna be, tryna be here my self
One of these, one of these, one of these days I swear down
I'ma join your workout
You won't be able to stand up

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
I used to have your name all up in my search girl
You wanna blaze but you're still a church gyal (Praise the lord)
Off-White I used to chill with virgil
That's okay baby, oh it was never personal
Let's make babies, why not?
Buy 'em all the hightops
Say I'm working too hard?
Momma worked 5 jobs
In this cold, cold world
You never change like seasons
Always come like evening
I got loads more reasons

[Chrous: Shakka]
From the speed dial , I'ma call her
She no drama, she no drama
In the winter or the summer
She no drama, she no drama
She don't like no fakes, she keep it real
She ain't on a wave , she know the deal
In the winter or the summer
She no drama, she no drama

[Outro: Not3s]
She wanna hit the road, hit the road when that sun's gone
She's gonna hit the road, hit the road when there's no sun
She really wanna hit the road, hit the road when that sun's gone
She's gonna hit the road, hit the road when there's no sun
She wanna hit the road, hit the road when that sun's gone
She's gonna hit the road, hit the road when there's no sun
There's no sun, ahh
There's no sun
And she's gone cause there's no sun
Aye
