[Chorus: Jake Bugg (Tinie Tempah)]
You're gonna find me
You're gonna find me
Whenever I'm losin' sleep
Whenever I'm hard to reach
You're gonna find me
You're gonna find me
I know times are hard enough
But it's not in my blood (Yeah Yeah)
To give up

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Got the heart of Bear Grylls, mind of a boss
Need a brand new Supremes diva like Diana Ross
Blew my first check on Stone Island and Mosch
Before we signed a deal, we made the sign of the cross
Yeah, yeah, Disturbing London sign, we're the best
Word to the hardware that brought me my success
Pressure on my city put you under duress
Man's just tryna do his ting, now he's under arrest
What the fuck?
I know the time we living in is crazy and hot
More crazy than the eighties
Spilling more J.D., more Baileys
We need more Adenugas and more Daleys
Every time we flourish, they don't wanna see us sprout
Crabs in a barrel, they don't wanna see us out
Sticking to my roots, time to take a different route
London's where you'll find me, you know what I'm about, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Jake Bugg (Tinie Tempah)]
You're gonna find me
You're gonna find me
Whenever I'm losin' sleep
Whenever I'm hard to reach
You're gonna find me
You're gonna find me
I know times are hard enough
But it's not in my blood (Yeah Yeah)
To give up

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Don't ever worry 'bout me, I always take a left
Make you feel to see your spirit every time we take a breath
We was on our paths, yo, way before we met
So all the darkest nights are the days we won't regret
Yeah, yeah, Disturbing London screaming Imhotep
Lobster for my bae, beef with my ex
Lord, forgive my need to succeed and progress
They were all my favourite rappers, now they see me as a threat
What the heck?
I know the time we living in is crazy, huh?
I know that we're in modern day slavery
They tell me more commercial and more mainstream
Tried to get me writers, had to get up out that fake scene
Sick of the chicanery, skullduggery
That's why I had to holla Jake, it was buggin' me
The same mindset since I made Disc-Overy
Now people all around the world wanna come and see, yeah

[Chorus: Jake Bugg (Tinie Tempah)]
You're gonna find me
You're gonna find me
Whenever I'm losin' sleep
Whenever I'm hard to reach
You're gonna find me (Find me)
You're gonna find me (Find me)
I know times are hard enough
But it's not in my blood
To give up

[Chorus: Jake Bugg]
You've gonna find me
You've gonna find me
Whenever I'm losin' sleep
Whenever I'm hard to reach
You're gonna find me
You're gonna find me
I know times are hard enough
But it's not in my blood
To give up

[Bridge]
We are going to play a typical number
With a typical amount of Loud & Low Passages

[Outro:  Tinie Tempah, Jada & Aleisha Lee]
Oooh, Free at last
I'm free at last
Drinking henny in the shower (Uh!)
I rock coach first class (Yeah!)
Tell me how does it feel (Uh!)
Fuckin' Iggy in a (Woo!)
Ha-Ha! Finally!
Finally! now I you're gonna f- me
You're gonna find me
You're gonna find me
You're gonna find me
You're gonna find me
You're gonna find me
Aye-aye-aye
