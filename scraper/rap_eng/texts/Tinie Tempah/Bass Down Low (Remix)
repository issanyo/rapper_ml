[Hook: Dev]
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

[Verse 1: Dev]
It's like one, two, three, fuck it
I'm about to take this drink and just stuff it
Fish tank this thing along with four more shots of Patron
Don't give a fuck about going home
Straight buzzin', Robotussin
Wanna get your mitts in my oven?
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'?
G-g-g-get a lick of this lovin'?

[Hook: The Cataracs]
Yeah, I like it loud and I'll make you shout
Give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that Boom Boom Pow

[Hook: Dev]
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

[Post-Hook: Dev]
Drop it to the floor
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
To the floor
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
(Drop it to the floor)
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
(To the floor)
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
OK, this drag girl's killing my visa
Because my rings [?] in a freezer
We bagging Dom PÃ©rignon by the litre
Getting lean like the Tower of Pisa
She said she fly from Miami to Ibiza
Nigga, I be doing anything to please her
So when I say Will, Simon, Neil and Jay
I mean later, I'll be getting in between her
And I like it loud
I'll make her disturb London Town
Cause know I be making Black Eyed P
Every note in my wallet is a 50 pound

[Hook: Dev]
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

[Post-Hook: Dev]
Drop it to the floor
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
To the floor
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Drop it to the floor
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
To the floor
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

[Bridge: Dev]
I got a question for you
Do you like it when I flow?
I got a question for you
Do you like it when I flow?
With my bass down low
Like la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la

[Hook: Dev]
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
Drop it to the floor
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
To the floor
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Drop it to the floor
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
To the floor
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
