[Hook: Livvi Franc]
And I could do this every night
We don't wait in any lines
It gets better every time
Feels so good, it ain't right
And I could do this every night
We don't wait in any lines
It gets better every time
Feels so good, it ain't right

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Hokey cokey cokey, I call up Tony for the ting
Way too old for Kendall, need Kourtney, Khloe or the Kim
Goin' Shirley Bassey, she want the rollie and the ring
Holy matrimony, she know I'm boning other tings
Stupid superstition, been gettin' chicks since "Wifey Riddim"
Bitch I conquered Britain, did what Dizzee did and Chippy didnâ€™t
Women tryna trap me, they want that little Diggy Simmons
Stop the hissy fittin', they soundin' like a missy riddim
Man United then I bop [?] Ridely Scott
Got a body type like Iggy and a voice like Pixie Lott
Tutankhamun when I shine on 150 watts
If she turning twenty-five I'mma buy her fifty shots
It's just me, Bonkaz, and Yungen and we're moving super stubborn
Know my crew Disturbing London, you can go and get your cousin, yeah
I'm a Scorpio, she a Gemini
When I do this, know I do it better every time, rah

[Hook: Livvi Franc]
And I could do this every night
We don't wait in any lines
It gets better every time
Feels so good, it ain't right
And I could do this every night
We don't wait in any lines
It gets better every time
Feels so good, it ain't right

[Verse 2: Yungen]
Two minutes from Ricky Rays
She says she like my two chains, I like her titty game
Quick menage, I had to save her under Nicki name
She said her city lame, she's tryna get a bit of fame
She heard I whip a Range, oh no, it's him again
She in uni now, I can fuck my sister's friends
Couple million views and I'm still in the ends
I sold the B-class, I'm tryna get a bigger Benz
I said a bigger Benz, man you know that pussy good, that batty big
That nighty linen
She been tryna be my wifey since like "Wifey Riddim"
That wet pussy, darg, the only time I might be slippin'
She said her ex lick-licked but this lighty didn't

[Refrain: Livvi Franc]
We can't stop until it's gone
Didn't you get the memo?
It's not over till we're done
I'm lovin' the aggression

[Hook: Livvi Franc]
And I could do this every night
We don't wait in any lines
It gets better every time
Feels so good, it ain't right
And I could do this every night
We don't wait in any lines
It gets better every time
Feels so good, it ain't right

[Verse 3: Bonkaz]
Nowadays, even when it's wrong, it feels right
Take a shot at my brother, you'll catch a shot in real life
All these scruffy MCs tryna come against me
Even when these jealous niggas try to block, I still shine
Look, I'm from the home of Krept and Kon, I'm from the home of Section
I'm from the home of Wicked Skeng and boy, they know the 7
Little homie, you don't know me you, just know my bredrin
I been attackin' all my goals, them boys are so defensive
Them boys are John Terry, them boys are John Stones
I get greazy like John Travolta when I'm on road
I hear them spittin', hear them rappin', yeah they got flows
Still can't fuck with Bonkz though
Damn, so if you come you better find me
You'll probably see me posing with my Yungen and my Tinie
Everyday progression man, them bruddas are not like me
Came in with that Smith & Wesson, man, I done it like I'm Haile, damn
