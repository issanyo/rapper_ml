Yeah (yeah) we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Lets have a toast a celebration get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out

(so) Let it rain
Let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out!

Yeah (i) yeah, I’m in charge now
I’m a star and I bought my fucking cast out
I live a very very very wild lifestyle
Heidi and Audrina eat your heart out
I used to listen to ‘you don’t wanna bring arms house’
I got so many clothes I keep’s em in ma aunts house
Disturbing London baby, we about to branch out
Soon I'll be the king like Prince Charles Child, Yeah!

Yeah, yeah and there ain't nobody fresher
Semester to semester, ravin’ with the freshers
20 light bulbs around my table and my dresser
ClC Kompressor, just in case that don’t impress her
Say hello to Dexter, say hello to Uncle Fester
Got them gazing at my necklace and my crazy sun protectors
G-Shocks I got a crazy don collection
Haters, I can't fucking hear your reception

Yeah (yeah) we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Lets have a toast a celebration get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out

(so) Let it rain
Let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out!

This shit was meant to last me 24 hrs man

Yeah, They say hello, they say ‘ola and they say bonjour
I’m pissed I never got to fly on a Concord
I bin Southampton but I've never bin to Scunthorpe
I’m fucking crazy with the kicks, call me Jean Claude

About to be a bigger star than my mum thought
Cos every day i got a groupie at my front door
Now I drive past the bus I used to run for
Where’s my fucking clap, where’s my encore?

I walk alone, cos I was born alone
I chirps her just for fun, I never ever call her phone
I leave her in the club, i never ever walk her home
DL the fuckin' foundation, I'm the cornerstone
I’m born famous
I’m sorta’ known
If your son doesn’t
I bet your daughter knows
Check out my visual, checkout my audio
Extra ordinary, yo, hope you enjoyed the show

Yeah (yeah) we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Lets have a toast a celebration get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out

(so) Let it rain
Let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out!

Woh ho, woh ho ho (etc)

Uh, Look at me I been a cheeky bastard, Man 'im
Look at all the drama we started, Now I'm
In here layin’ on my back, sayin’ DJ won't ya gimmie one
More track

[insert drum and bass riddims]

I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning (repeated
During d&b)

(so) Let it rain
Let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out!

Let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out!

Pass out (echo)
Pass out (echo)
