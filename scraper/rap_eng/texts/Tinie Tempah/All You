[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, it's how I'm feeling
Messing with the vibe, fucking with the mood
I got the paper and the baccy and a lighter too
Never seen a pair of these Nike shoes
And she says she's scared of heights, but she likes the view
Ooh, tell me this is all you
Ooh, tell me this is all you
Say the legend and the myth is all true
Tell me this is all you, ooh
[?] getting 80 for a medley
I've got eyes way bigger than the belly
Try so hard, give a celebrity a semi
Stars in their eyes, Matthew Kelly
Yeah, by any means necessary
I'm elite, I'mma leave enemies dead and buried
Down the beach, Tenerife, got my Jeep in a ferry
I was famous in my college, and a G in secondary
Getting workloads
Yeah, I hustled down a workload
Grind house, Kurt Russell on a dirt road
In the kitchen scraping resin off of burnt toast
If Mum'd ever catch me raving in my church clothes
Had me rocking bargains and sales
Now it's Tom Ford and Prada and Karl Legerfeld
Tell 'em bonjour, ça va and au revoir as well
They gon' smile when you win and they gon' laugh when you fail, nigga

[Pre-Hook: G FrSH]
I told her from long time, yeah
I'm only here one night, yeah
I'm in Room 222
If you want it, I got it, it's all you
I told her from long time, yeah
I'm only here one night, yeah
I'm in Room 222
If you want it, I got it, it's all you, yeah

[Hook: G FrSH]
This is all you, I tell 'em this is all you
I tell 'em this is all you, yeah
This is all you, I tell 'em this is all you
I tell 'em this is all you, yeah
This is all you, I tell 'em this is all you
I tell 'em this is all you, yeah
This is all you, I tell 'em this is all you
Baby, it's all you

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
Even when I lie, baby, I'm the truth
Posh ting, hate my trackies but she likes my suits
Told me that her dad's some rich tycoon
Well, tell him this nigga ain't shining shoes
It's all you, baby, this is all you
Baby, this is all you
See, I'm Ric with the flair, got my Roley in the air
Ahh yeah, I got finger force too, I got figures for you
I ain't no four-figure nigga
Growing up I had a score nigga, nigga
Then I took the two 0s out the poor nigga, nigga
And I got white money, don't call me a nigga, no way
Tell a man run that
99 probs, bring the one back
I bought a Céline for a scumbag
Told her bring a friend but they're only getting one back
I ain't on a play ting
No talking in my ears when I'm raving
Some 'Can you listen to my mixtape?' ting
Just another light skin nigga on a Drake ting
See everything I do big, even Burberry check the pattern
See, it wasn't in my genes to be shopping over Hatton
Told the fed I can't breathe, and the copper pulled the baton
The shit we go through, man, you wouldn't even fathom

[Pre-Hook: G FrSH]
I told her from long time, yeah
I'm only here one night, yeah
I'm in Room 222
If you want it, I got it, it's all you
I told her from long time, yeah
I'm only here one night, yeah
I'm in Room 222
If you want it, I got it, it's all you, yeah

[Hook: G FrSH]
This is all you, I tell 'em this is all you
I tell 'em this is all you, yeah
This is all you, I tell 'em this is all you
I tell 'em this is all you, yeah
This is all you, I tell 'em this is all you
I tell 'em this is all you, yeah
This is all you, I tell 'em this is all you
Baby, it's all you, yeah

[Outro: G FrSH]
One of you can have it
Uh, uh, as long as I can grab it
But I don't know how you're gonna manage
Cuh you're probably gonna fall, baby I ain't into catching
Listen, ease up
One of you can have it
Uh, uh, as long as I can grab it
But I don't know how you're gonna manage
Cuh you're probably gonna fall, baby I ain't into catching
Listen, ease up
