[Intro]
I'm ready
I'm ready

I'm ready for the start of something new
I'm ready to depart from what make me blue
I'm ready for my heart to let you through
But most of all, most of all

[Verse 1]
Cause I'm ready for the stress
Ready for the test
Cause I'm ready for you going through my texts
God, I guess I'm getting ready for the red seat in the press, yes
I guess I'm going on a guess
Some people shallow, love the way you act deaf
How you listen, how you never act deaf
Thinking maybe make a baby who could share the same breath

We could, unwind
I really wanna call you up sometime
I wanna fly you to every city
Your pretty spoil you silly
Really 'till you had enough sunshine

My mind and my mind
I think I'm ready for the settle
All this closure
I'm ready for the settle
Couple main things
Another thing on the side
And I now I think of the side
And that I'm ready for the special

[Chorus]
I'm ready for your love
I'm ready for your love
I'm ready for your love
(x4)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
All my blonde hair girls are the most fun
All my brown hair girls are the most fun
All my red hair girls there the most
Said they want a man
Shit, but they don't want a broke one
Love is that a bus is when you want it when it won't come
She said her ex had to grow some
I could be the way you loan some
Ready for my love, I could get off in the autumn

Tickling past, we're giggling, laughing
Similar arse to Nicki Minaj
Disturbing London, girl the city is ours
Ain't got to look up in the sky to see the prettiest stars
All my blonde hair girls are the most fun
All my brown hair girls are the most fun
All my red hair girls there the most fun
Said they want a man
Shit, but they don't want a broke one

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Stars burn bright
Everything is changed between you and I
I was so apprehensive but I don't know why
Baby I'm ready for you to be by my side, by my side
(x2)

[Chorus]
