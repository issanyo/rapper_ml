[Intro: Tinie Tempah]
(Yeah)
When they're tryna get the girl to the crib and she leaves, it's peak
Tryna keep it discrete and she tweets, it's peak
See me rolling with 20 man deep, it's peak
Yo rudeboy, pull up, repeat, it's peak

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Master with the melody
Shit's hard, a charger for my energy
Real hard, didn't ask for this celebrity
Already more ready than I'll never be
They're nuttin' anybody telling me
Rudeboy, you ain't got a part in the legacy
You are not a star, cause your heart's full of jealousy
Pagan mandem
Tell Sloth that I don't rate them mandem, Satan brang them
Brap yo, man's had to stack dough, getting pack loads
Black boys in black clothes, doing mad shows
Could've worked in macros, that's a fact bro
Mum knows and Dad knows
When they're tryna act gully on the beat
Got no money for the weed
None of them honeys wanna beat
Got no followers to tweet
Nigga tell 'em, go tell 'em it's peak
(Yeah)

[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
When they're try'na get the girl to the crib and she leaves, it's peak
(Didn't even know that)
Try'na keep it discrete and she tweets, it's peak
(Girl I never saw that)
See me rolling with 20 man deep, it's peak
(Click clack, gon' blow that)
Yo rudeboy, pull up, repeat, it's peak

[Refrain]
They don't want a war with the king

[Verse 2: Stormzy]
Come to the party, man getting locked off
Walk in the rave with your chain getting popped off
Get to the hotel, man ain't got signal
Yo Flipz, please let me jump in your hotspot
Everybody wanna send shots for the top shots
Don't care 'bout your ratas or your what-not
Yo, let me hear them jokes, wanna knock knock
Bang bang, everybody die when it pops off
I'm only joking, that's so rude
Kill 'em every time when I'm spitting in the booth
Spin 'em on a grime ting, spin 'em on a rap ting
Spin 'em like I have been spinnin' from a yout
You done a mad ting, yeah man you stabbed him
But that was just something that you didn't wanna do
Man think they're bad cause they smoked one zoot
Look I'm better than him and I'm better than you

[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
When they're try'na get the girl to the crib and she leaves, it's peak
(Didn't even know that)
Try'na keep it discrete and she tweets, it's peak
(Girl I never saw that)
See me rolling with 20 man deep, it's peak
(Click clack, gon' blow that)
Yo rudeboy, pull up, repeat, it's peak

[Verse 3: Bugzy Malone]
Yo
The Nokia's still ringing and it's peak
I didn't even know that
Cause I've been on the roadside collecting money all week
I didn't even know that
I just been through more green than a sycamore tree
I didn't even know that
I'm about to do another million views, it's peak
Don't send for me, if you send for me, it's weak
And I've just moved from Freddy Krueger's street
Now I have a nightmare to every 25 dreams
Them man are still chasing 25 G's
And I'm tryna pick a pair from 125 sneaks
They said they didn't follow my Instagram
How did he know Drizzy Drake was following me
I didn't even know that
Just know I stay Manchester until I can't breathe

[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
When they're try'na get the girl to the crib and she leaves, it's peak
(Didn't even know that)
Try'na keep it discrete and she tweets, it's peak
(Girl I never saw that)
See me rolling with 20 man deep, it's peak
(Click clack, gon' blow that)
Yo rudeboy, pull up, repeat, it's peak

[Outro]
They don't want a war with the king (x7)
PEAK! (x4)
