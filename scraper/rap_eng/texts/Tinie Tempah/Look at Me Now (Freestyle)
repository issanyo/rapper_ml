[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Plus Ciroc, Petron or Henne
Tryna sell a billion
Call me Elvis Presley
Keep it, old school
You niggas elementary
Got a red and yellow chick
That kinda look like Robyn Fenty
And when her head shit
I call it migraine
Blindfold a bitch, to my crib
Call it blind date
Next single me and Wiz
I bet we finish high mate
Rebecca Black
Everyday a Friday

[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
Look at me now
Look at my style
Ooo, fitted and tapered
Look at me now
Look at me how?
I be fresher than a motherfucker

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
If it ain't Billboard GQ or Now
How the hell can you fools look at me now
You niggers dont eat in Philippe Chow
And you ain't no members of Soho House
When i go all out, ain't got no spouse
Made cheese and cream, all without no cal
International now fam, without no doubt
Fuck girls with names that I can't pronounce

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Man fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y’all doing
I’m Lil Tunechi, I’m a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don’t eat sushi, I’m the shit, no, I’m pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dressed like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain’t eatin’, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot ‘em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then I’m like olé
I don’t care what you say, so don’t even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That’s word to my flag, and my flag red
I’m out of my head, bitch I’m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain’t hotter than mine, nope
Not on my time and I’m not even trying
Whats popping slime
Nothing five, and if they trippin’ fuck ‘em five
I ain’t got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas, as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight, bitch I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice and my daddy’s dead
You faggots scared cause I’m too wild, been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
I’m so Young Money, if you got eyes look at me now, bitch
