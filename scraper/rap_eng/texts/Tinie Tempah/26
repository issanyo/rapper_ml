[Hook x2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, where my girls at?
Where my girls, where my girls, where my girls at?
Where my girls with the curves and the curls at?
Said I'm chauvinistic, bet she couldn't even spell that

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
I think we need a new replacement
I think we need to come up with a new arrangement
She don't wanna let it go, she say he's too amazing
I know that nigga did you wrong but you forgave him, that's the main thing
Newest strain, getting higher than the NASA station
Fascinate her with the fame, say "it's fascinating"
Out of style, out of favour, out of fashion maybe
Oh, she always think about me when she masturbating
Sometimes the sun shine, sometimes it's fun times
Sometimes someone cries and sometimes it's one life
Sometimes it takes time, I need some time to unwind
Sometimes the DJ, she'll play this back one time
Empathise with the shit that we felt
Uh, I empathise with the shit that you felt
Mixing business with pleasure, mixing business with girls
There's nothing for me in the city I dwell, let's go

[Pre-Hook: Labrinth]
Where do we go from here?
Wishing we left it all at "hello"
Feeling so cold out here
I hear the voices say "don't let go"
Come home
So fuck it, I'm gone
It be lonely out in Hollywood

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
King of the city, I'm a king around
Yeah, the people saying I'm a winner now
Yeah, you're looking good, a little slimmer down
There, who you seeing, who you been around?
Yeah, yeah, every time I see you, I say halleluh
Yeah, I've got that magic, got that colour blue
Yeah, all them other women fall at number two
You feeling like my lucky woman, what number are you?
Number none, my number one, I'm done with crying, you done with drama
Troublesome, this double fund, you relieve the stress when I'm onto some
Yeah, you relieve the stress when I'm onto some
Find a sheet and get under one
Let's go on and on, on and on, uh
Tell me how I'm supposed to win
Ain't nobody told me how I'm supposed to win
I don't wanna settle down man, I'm focusing
And there's plenty more fishes in the ocean, yeah

[Pre-Hook: Labrinth]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
How can I say this shit again how I said it before?
I'll probably do this shit again and regret it tomorrow
Before, before this shit was dead, it was better before
Now every conversation end like we're waging a war

(Clip fades out here)
