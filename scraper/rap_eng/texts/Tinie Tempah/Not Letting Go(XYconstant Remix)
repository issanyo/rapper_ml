[Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, ready for the summer, girl, your hair looks killa
See your batty getting bigger but your waist looks slimmer
And I hope I'm still with you when your hair get thinner
I ain't gotta work it out, I know I'm onto a winner
And I love it when I see you sing a song in the mirror
When you play your favourite records where there ain't no filler
Chicky-cha, chicky-chicky-cha, Sade, J Dilla
Now I'm on the right track, from the train to the limo
Now we're on the right track (right track), yeah
Used to know me back in college, now I got it like that
Could have got the side track, now I'm back on my feet
If I hadn't achieved, would you pack up and leave?
Now you scratchin' on me like we're Adam and Eve
Playing remix to Ignition in the back of the Jeep, ah
She like the hook but she don't know the verse
She know I love her even if I never say the words
