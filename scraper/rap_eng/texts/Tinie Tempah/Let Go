[Hook: Emeli Sand√©]
If you can see me, then you're probably a little too close
So you think you could love me, well you gotta be stronger than most
Cause my ex didn't like it, didn't like it
No my friends they don't like it, they don't like it
Somebody remind me
When's the right time, when's the right time to let go

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, dear whoeva the fuck is listening
Tell me of the pleasures of being a normal citizen
Cause all these fittins' at Vivvienne's keeping me from fittin' in
Why do I feel safer on stage than in my own living room
My grandma say that if I leave my drink I shouldn't sip again
Ooh this tour has got me feeling tired like I'm Michelin
And uh even though it's physical differences in my siblings
That's why I feel so down even at the top of the River Thames

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, dear whoeva the fuck is witnessin'
Disturbing London independent black businessman
Based on the work and the effort I'm gunna give this year
Everybody's getting the presents they want for Christmas, yeah
Life is only ninety nine winters
So I'm tryna bond with daddy even though I don't like Guinness
Don't be confused by my image, I'm no fuckin' public pin-up
But my heart won't let me say no to a picture

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, dear whoeva the fuck is, Fuck it, this is discovery hate it or love it
I'm now officially the property of the public since licensing my album
And signing a deal to be published
But none of these songs are written for me, nor am I a puppet
Journalists come for interviews but don't stay on the subject
Yeah, no, yea - are we done yet?
Questions you've asked me hundreds, now can you grant me some rest
Because I'm tired of it, I'm living out my dream, and I'm tired from it
If music needed saving, I'd die for it
Music's where my heart is, I'm alive for it
I promise

[Break]
If I'm never liked my heart might break
Here in the dark, yeah, we'll be safe
I don't care, no looking back
I've never been, never been, this far from home

[Hook]
