[Hook]
My Mercedes flash, Cavalli flash
New Huarache flash, paparazzi flash
Check Instagram, I'm flash, AP flash
Them boobs real, them flash, girl you so flash
Turn on that flash, wealthy, flash
Selfie, flash, tell Colgate it's peak
Let bygones be bygones and so forth and so on
Don't tell me about real, I've been that from day one

[Verse 1]
I go hard, I go nuts, we dem boyz, bitch, hold up
I wake up, drink black tea, two spoons of gold dust
I skip lunch then get drunk, get high then throw up
25 going 26, should act like a grown up
Let's go, yeah, act like a Roman when I'm in Rome
Rock Tom Brown, I rock the Rick Owen
And I don't like the sound of your tone
Play Roll Deep then roll out, them real hoes don't hold out
Obeyed rules under mum's roof, now I live in my own house
Puff pass, then pass out, her bass up, her arse down
Mum used to say don't get stoned in no glass house
But D, build me my zoot up, GQ my suitor
Fuck getting to shoot us when you're tryna wrap the next shoot up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, girl, give me the something
Just drop me a couple of digits, girl, fuck me intimate
She know when I handle myself it's a privilege
Be careful, the drugs gonna fuck with your image
Up in the, up in the club
Up in the club and she rubbing it up
All of this alcohol fucking me up
Fortune and fame, girl, I'm sucking it up
Getting some brain while I'm touching her one time
So many shots, it's like gun crime
My semi cock, girl, let it pop
This Celebrity Come Dine
Big celebrity alumni, too much for the clubbers to handle
Thinking particular angles, getting my BRIT Awards up on the mantle
In that Vin Diesel, nigga, my [?] worse
Yeah, I said it first, Paris where I get it first
No filter and no hashtags, show 50k on my Snapchat
New money, just flash cash, tryna get stock on that Nasdaq
New money, just flash cash, tryna get stock on that Nasdaq

[Hook]

[Outro]
I've been that from day one, I've been that from day one
Don't tell me about real, I've been that from day one
Flash, â…• plus tax
Paid it all in cash, Ibiza in Pacha
