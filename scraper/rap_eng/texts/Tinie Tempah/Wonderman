[Intro]
The strong, the mighty
The forces of evil could never destroy
The power of the Wonderman
And though the most formidable journey lies ahead
Only one will prevail
Wonder, wonder, Wonderman

[Verse 1]
These haters couldn't get to where I am with a full tank of petrol
My uncle used to drink a can of kestrel when life got stressful
What kinda person should you be
When you wanna make people accept you
What does it really mean
When you dream of being famous and successful
When you were born to be special
Uh, yeah and I went from the kid in class
Texting radio DJs so they could big me up
To the young rapper everybody's ringing up
Got em looking for a sprinkle of that pixie dust
Mad thoughts in my head when it's blowing up
Like, are you really big enough?
I traded friends for fans
Cement for sand
Raise your hand
The Wonderman

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
Do you see the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you
To take it all away
I saw the chosen one they’re calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The Wonderman

[Verse 2]
Bored of being nameless
Bored of feeling awkward when you walk up in the mall
And can’t afford a pair of trainers
Imagine when it changes
Imagine satisfaction when you make it
It’s more than being famous
More than the applause and more than any form of status
More than the performances in twenty foreign places
Benidorm, Vegas, many more praises
Amen hallelujah Tinie look what's happened to ya
Yeh they love that attitude brand new and improved, yeh
And when the fans start grabbing you
Show gratitude with a little braggin' too
Amen hallelujah Tinie look what's happened to ya
Who can say they ran all the obstacles I ran look
I traded friends for fans
Cement for sand
Raise your hand
The Wonderman

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
Do you see the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you
To take it all away
I saw the chosen one they’re calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The Wonderman

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
Come on come on the stars are where you belong
Come on follow your heart is gonna take you home
Come on come on the stars are where you belong
There's no turning back from here

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
Do you see the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you
To take it all away
I saw the chosen one they’re calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The Wonderman

The Wonderman
From this day on the world will never be the same
