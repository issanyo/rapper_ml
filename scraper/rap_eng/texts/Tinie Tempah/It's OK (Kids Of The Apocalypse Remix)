[Hook: Labrinth]

Don't you cry now?
Don't you cry now?
Cause then I know you still feel something for me

Don't you cry now?
Don't you cry now?
Cause Then I know you still feel something for me

Don't you cry now?
Don't you cry now?

[Verse: Tinie Tempah]

You told me you was down for whatever
I thought you'd be around me forever
You were my New York girl with some LA ambition and a really good christian
You knocked me down like a featherweight
Tryin' to fuck around with a heavyweight
How the hell could you say in the middle of the night that we should call it a day?
I'd rather fucking do a bit of prison time
You had the key to every single thing of mine
My house, My Car....

Where men lie their women cry but she won't
I can't breathe I won't cope, I need a drink, I want a smoke
Cause I'm the cigarette butt of my own jokes
Hands held high because my back against the ropes
Blood is thicker than water, we were thicker than blood
Now I'm feeling for something I can't touch
Feelin' guilty while you be up in the club
Shit, I been caught so who am I to judge?
I guess we didn't agree to the same deal
I guess that she was tired of the same spiel
And now I'm in the meat packing dialing 911
Tryin' to tell'em how this pain feels
So runaway, run along, thought we were fate, but we were wrong
We Were Wrong, We were wrong.....

[Hook: Labrinth]

Don't you cry now?
Don't you cry now?
Cause then I know you still feel something for me
Don't you cry now?
Don't you cry now?
Cause then I know you still feel something for me
Still feel something for me
Still feel something for me
Still feel something for me

But I truly know it's over when I hear you say, it's okay, It's okay...

Don't you cry now?
Don't you cry now?
Cause then I know you still feel something for me
Don't you cry now?
Don't you cry now?
Don't you cry now?
Don't you cry now?
