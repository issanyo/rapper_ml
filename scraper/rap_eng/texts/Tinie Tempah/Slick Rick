[Intro: J Spades]
Ladi dadi (Slick Rick)
We likes to party
We don't cause trouble
We don't bother nobody (the beat boss)

[Hook: J Spades]

[Verse 1: J Spades]
Head Nigga in Charge
East London, call me big darg
Where I come from, niggas don't live long
Had to sell drugs for my income
Spent ten years in Kingston
Then I catch a flight, come-a England
Name ring bells like ding dong
Cause I'm stepping on the city like King Kong
Yo, rappers wanna link up
Boy, you're doing everyting wrong
Millions of bars on the F64s
But you can't make a big song
Now it's my phone them a ring, don
Tryna get my style and my lingo
Cause the word on the roads is Spades gonna blow
And they're waiting for my single
Nigga lick the jackpot like bingo
Popping like Pringles
Beating up your gyal when you link up
Cause bad bitches are in tow
Now you know I'm old school like Flintstones
Now you know how the ting go
Well my niggas let the ting go
Everybody haffi breeze like window

[Hook: J Spades]
These bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, nigga, yeah I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick
Sick Rick, nigga, yeah I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, Slick Rick
Bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, Slick Rick
Niggas be watching cause I'm Slick Rick

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I spit spit some slick shit
Bitch, I'm Slick Rick
I drive crisp whips, getting to mischief
Or mit fix big spliffs
I take it all down, I don't sip sip
Between an Inbetweener and a Misfit
5'9", but like 6'6"
I did your free download and went skip, skip
Nigga, why you fronting? Why you lying in The Mirror
Like you should've been the one when you know you never was?
Fuck a nigga, thinkin' he can never criticise
And he thinking if he don't, man, you know he ain't a boss
Cause they ain't us
And we ain't them (I hate them niggas)
Amen, amen, amen
Could've sprayed a spade, I brought J Spades
An ace of spades cause nigga, we making waves
Same tracksuit 50 Shades of Grey
Now I'm tailor-made, amazing grace
So fuck it, let a nigga be selfish
Fuck it, let a nigga be Elvis
Now the whole world my oyster
Fuck it, let a nigga eat shelfish
Lucky I ain't never had to sell shit
Cause it's trouble when you've gotta be the eldest
Now I'm in a shop on some Pharrell shit
Buying velvet at Selfridge, I can't help it, selfish
We the top boys in the area
All of my dogs and my terrier
Come see me with your biggest CD
When you've had a top 10 up in America, yeah

[Hook: J Spades]
These bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick

Slick Rick, bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick
Sick Rick, nigga, yeah I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, Slick Rick
Bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, Slick Rick
Niggas be watching cause I'm Slick Rick

[Verse 3: Professor Green]
I could be up in the club with my jewellery on
But I'd rather be at home with a Blu-Ray on
Fuck, I've owned the club, fuck, I've owned the beer
Fuck, I've owned enough so what the fuck I crying for?
What the fuck I rhyme for? I'll tell you why
Cause the crib ain't big enough until I need to take an elevator
Just so I can get up to the ninth floor
See, money's something I've got an addiction to
The more I got, the more the addiction grew
It's like a sickness, tell the doctor I need an appointment
And probably a prescription too
And it'll get ripped in two
I like being this sick, it's what I spit for
Die for what I live for, been foul, but I'm rich now
So what am I still getting shit for?
I got arrested tryna protect my wife
A reprobate, got reprimanded and was read my rights
Wasn't the best of nights
Subsequently I got dropped by Puma
But ever the optimist, I try and look at the positives
At least I get to wear my Nikes
I'd beware my chatter cause I'm harder
And tell Akala I am a racist, I hate white rappers

[Hook: J Spades]
These bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick

Slick Rick, bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick
Sick Rick, nigga, yeah I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, Slick Rick
Bitches be watching cause I'm Slick Rick
Slick Rick, Slick Rick
Niggas be watching cause I'm Slick Rick
