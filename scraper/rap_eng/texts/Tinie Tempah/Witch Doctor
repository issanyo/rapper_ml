[Intro: Candice Pillay]
I ain't tryna wake up to your voodoo in the morning so
Good afternoon, it's witch doctor woman

[Hook: Candice Pillay]
Witch doctor woman
Witch doctor woman
Witch doctor woman
Witch doctor woman
Witch doctor woman
Witch doctor woman
Witch doctor woman
Witch doctor woman
Good afternoon, it's witch doctor woman

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
She say she wanna get up on that rapper shit
Popping bottles, stuffing money under mattresses
She been on that tour bus since I picked her up at Hammersmith
Her arse so round I thought it had to be a camera trick
Eh, where you going in them Izzy Marants?
Hop on a train, come and chill with me and Dizzee in France
Hop on a plane, you can come to any city you want
I got the fame, you could be on Necole Bitchie tomorrow
Couldn’t never love a lippy yat
But she got me acting like a pussy for that kitty cat
Reverse cowgirl, reverse piggy back
I thought you said your arse was mine, come and gimme that!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
She said she wanna get in on that rapper shit
She wanna polish the awards up in my cabinet
She a ten, she defy the law of averages
Thought she Catholic but that Rihanna tat in Arabic
Where you going in that pretty Givenchy Dress
I’ll intro you to Westwood buy you Vivienne’s garms
The alcohol that she ingests just hope her liver ain’t harmed
I bring her flowers but she says she want a stickier plant
From trips on a bus now she’s on a trip and a buzz
When lighting strikes wonder if God is taking pictures of us
We finally made it on our own through all the hicks and the cups
Maybe some magic came and cured this fucking sickness in us

(I ain't tryna wake up to your voodoo in the morning so
Good afternoon, it's witch doctor woman)

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
(Keep it running)
From not giving a fuck
Now she’s in here giving a fuck
I made her feel like Lewis Hamilton was picking her up
Don’t even mind the other groupies and the strippers and stuff
No time to waste, might as well face it, you’re addicted to love
Cause I am sick
What you prescribing?
Give me a fix
Sip on a cocktail of lots of shit we shouldn’t mix (ugh)
Yeah

[Hook]
