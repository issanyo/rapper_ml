[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me

[Verse 2: Ellie Goulding]
Touch me and then turn away
And put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
Cause I don't wanna be a ball and chain

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and...
I just don't know what is wrong

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, give me that respect, forgive me and forget
You've got to get a grip, living on the edge
I barely even know this fucking woman in my bed
And if there is too much on my plate then I ain't finishing my veg
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life
You got me wrapped up in your shit, I'm feeling mummified
I've only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice
You gave me what I needed and I gave her everything she wanted
There's something 'bout your cleavage, now I can't put my fingers on it
Been taking me the deepest, I thought that she was gonna vomit
If all women are from Venus then I guess I really got a rocket
You've got a noose around my neck but I'm still hanging on
We've nearly reached the finish line up in our marathon
I spat a verse, she sang a song
She broke my heart, I took some Gaviscon

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
With you and me
With you and
