[Hook: Eric Turner]
Angels and stars
Hear them on the radio
Got them on the stereo

Reaching too far
Listen in the radical
Now we need a miracle

[Intro: Tinie Tempah]
(Eric Turner! Ishi! Tinie! Lupe Fiasco! Let’s go!)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, uh, Lupe in the lead
Staring as a star
In a movie about a king
From the trailer, to the credits
I believe we’ve made an epic, Eric
Isn't it everything we’ve ever dreamed?
Hella dope, Angels on my shoulders said it’s so
Give it two feathers up
But your gonna need a telescope
To the see these stars on the track
I call it Hollywood Boulevard on attack

[Eric Turner]
Look to the skies
Diamonds in the starlight
Written in the dark night of love

The truth will arise
Listening just feels right
Careful with the spotlight
Of angels and stars

[Hook: Eric Turner]
Angels and stars
Hear them on the radio
Got them on the stereo

Reaching too far
Listen in the radical
Now we need, now we need a miracle

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
I’m tryna hold on to morals and be virtuous
I know I ain’t perfect, every week Mommy tell me to come and worship
And I’ll be acting like I don’t know where the church is
Ducked down, gazing at angels
Ashamed of the way that the fame can just change you
Plus they want a picture of you, now trying to frame you
When you need a miracle, who will be there to save you?

[Eric Turner]
Try to be a soul, tainted am
Rise for me in a moment
Turn it up
Turning days wrong
Paper lost
Turn the beats ...,
Angels and stars

Angels and stars
Hear them on the radio
Got them on the stereo

Reaching too far
Listen in the radical
Now we need, now we need a miracle

I look to the skies
Diamonds in the starlight
Written in the stars right

Angels and stars
Angels and stars
Angels and stars

Angels and stars
Hear them on the radio
Got them on the stereo

Angels and stars

Reaching too far
Reaching too far
Reaching too far

Angels and stars
