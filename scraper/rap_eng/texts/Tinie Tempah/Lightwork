[Intro]
Mi nah pick up
Pecknarm yeah?
You see the ting that ah gwarn
It's a madness with that
You get involved?
Nah, [?], you see it?
You saying love and peace yeah?
Love and peace
Good yes ak, yes ak
Straight, hear mi nah

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo
Yo
Comin' from the southside where the slang ghetto
I got a zebra in my house and an antelope
Been round the world, doing jet, Steve Angello
Rockin' white gold, pink gold and the yellow
Word to Dizzee man, I used to wanna rock Ecko
See the crib, keep the shit so Art Deco
Another one, it's another dubplate special
I make her feel so good that she can't say no
Uh, gettin' wasted at my rap party
I coulda shagged Don and I shoulda shagged Carley
Venice at the weekend with my black Barbie
Feel like Beckham, Lamborghini and a black Harley
Uh, she order capers and calamari
Love AJ, but I can't stand Armani
Been Ibiza, I ain't never been to Faliraki
Passin' out like the royal navy and the army

[Chorus]
Uh, you see the hits? Lightwork
Long sentence, got bars, I'm a lifer
I just do it for the kids like Michelle Pfeiffer
I'm gettin' paid, me and Mitch like Mekhi Phifer
Uh, we made love but I never wifed her
Uh, got a BET and I ain't never done cypher
Hatin' on us 'cause we young rich
No more pics with niggas we don't really fuck with

[Post-Chorus]
You see the hits? Lightwork
You see the hits? Lightwork
Drop the beat then she might twerk
You see the hits? Lightwork

[Verse 2]
Yeah, black boys gettin' white paper
Flickin' on my Periscope, like "Hi hater"
From the underground, now we in the skyscraper
Got a wicked white ting like Hermione Granger
Uh, she look good but I sound amazin'
That's lots of filters and foundation
Where my dogs at, where my Alsatians?
Fur coat 'cause 101 Dalmatians
We gettin' Malia and Maga skankin'
Got 10 gold chains, I'm just Shabba Rankin'
Been V Fest, but I'm never on a camp ting
You ain't gotta watch Christ, see these rappers actin'
She like the fact that I'm hard workin'
I told the pigs that they can't search him
Tried to bury me alive but they can't murk him
I just drop a number one, then she start twerkin'

[Chorus]
Uh, you see the hits? Lightwork
Long sentence, got bars, I'm a lifer
I just do it for the kids, like Michelle Pfeiffer
I'm gettin' paid, like when Chris left Billie Piper
Uh, bustin' Dom P with Lil' Kleine
I got broads in Atlanta that are by design
Uh, now these haters wanna jump ship
No more pics with niggas we don't really fuck with

[Post-Chorus]
You see the hits? Lightwork
You see the hits? Lightwork
Drop the beat then she might twerk
You see the hits? Lightwork
You see the hits? Lightwork
