This year I ain't doing no favours
This year I ain't doing no-
I will step on man's toes, I will step on man's shoes and his laces
I'm stupid and dangerous, I knew I'd be famous
And blood is thicker than water
So if you ain't family or man dem, assume you're a stranger
Shining in grime, paid my dues and my labours
Couple DaVinChes, a few Terror Danjahs
You niggas ain't really done shit
You niggas ain't really done shit
You niggas don't really want it
Let man buy a million hits
You ain't men, you are silly dumb divs, you wish
Why you getting mad cause I say it how it is?
When I was nominated I was living in the bits
And when I won two, I was tripping in my lift
Thinking what the fuck I'm gonna do with these BRITs
Passive aggressive, I'm passive aggressive
I'm passive aggressive, I'm passive aggressive
Copy my style but my fashion's expensive
Man want a feature but what's the incentive?
Don't wanna be in those videos
With all your silly hoes and all your cars that you've rented
G, I'm too busy at clarking and kenting
Too used to dudes valet parking my Benz
And it's fun again, fun again, fun again
Shit feels fun again, I'm up for it, come on then
Shit like I poo, thanks, wanna come again?
Shit like Apu, thank you and come again
Heard the whole crew, I don't rate none of them
Don't care if they said I gotta come on them
If you don't like me, that's a bummer then
Let's see who's selling out shows in the summer then
Is it really good?
Call me something, don't know if he really would
From day 0 he was saying he would blow
Why the F he hasn't blown yet if he really could?
Take it home, sing it if you're really hood
In 05 I was chilling in the shubz
2014, more girls, more airplay and more cream
Cause everybody wanna hear more morphine
Been spitting fire in the booth since 14
Any one of us could have been Stephen
And any one of our mothers could be Doreen
